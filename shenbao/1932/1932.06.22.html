<h3 id="c1">爲法律奮鬥　翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>予爲本報月刊。徴文於吾友吳經熊博士。吳博士語予曰。「申報創辦於一八七二年。是年也。不特爲中國新聞事業史上富有意義之一年。亦世界法學史上最重要之一年。蓋德國大儒伊耶陵所著之爲法律奮鬥一書。亦適於是年初版也。」按伊氏斯書譯文逹二十一種。版本無數。日文有陸奥宗光本梁任公嘗取其義而作論權利思想。採入飲冰室文集。原書有六十年之歷史。適與本報同年。而國譯本猶付闕如。予嘗譯其半。以事冗未竟。至以爲憾。是書在此死氣沈沈之學術界中。不受國人重視。固不足。異惟是書正切合於六十年後吾國今日之現狀。足以激發我民族之猛省。足以針砭我民族之通病。此我之所以亟欲一述焉。</p>
<p>伊氏之中心主張曰。「法律之目的爲和平。而和平之代價爲奮鬥。」其義至精。蓋一部法律進化史。即一部民族奮鬥史。西洋羅馬時代貴族與平民鬥爭之結果。始有保護平民的十二銅碑法之創立。近世中產階級與封建階級鬥爭之結果。始有著名的人權宣言之宣佈。誠以一民族之法律保障。必須從絶大之犧牲與奮鬥中得之。固不能蠢立痴望。如守株待兎。而可以希冀也。和平非苟安可致。當有相當代價。此代價爲何。曰奮鬥。不斷的奮鬥。殊死的奮鬥。斯一義也。偉大無倫。可以施諸内政。亦可以施諸外交。吾民族困於内戰也久矣。非戰之籲求。磅薄於全國。而干戈之未息也如故。上海停戰恊定之墨瀋未乾。而廣東鬩墻之鬥爭又起。吾人民之哀呼。雖聲嘶力竭。初無動乎軍閥之方寸。而人民尙欲在不自奮鬥不自掙扎中求和平。其可得乎。吾民族困於苛政也久矣。憲政之需要人皆知之。然而所謂憲政運動者不作奮鬥之準備。不事基本之鍜鍊。而徒向執政者呼求政權之交還。與虎謀皮。其可得乎。人類歷史中。有如此廉價之憲政乎。吾民族困於外患也久矣。敵進一尺。吾退一丈。近百年來吾無限之國土與國權。皆斷送於此一進一退之中。自九一八以還。此一進一退之步驟。愈益加緊急速。而我民族精神。並不因此稍振。徒隨不抵抗政府之後。祈禱國聯出力。爲我恢復國土。其可得乎。世界民族救國運動中。有如此卑劣之運動乎。</p>
<p>鳴呼。伊氏斯書。誠對我人之當頭一棒也。一則曰。「法律賜與人民。非不勞而獲者。人民必須鼓勇邁進。流血奮鬥。然後得之。」再則曰。「法律在其歷史的進程中。其所呈我人之眼簾者。是一幅猛攻奮鬥堅苦卓絶拚命找出路之寫眞。」三則曰。「一民族之權利。受人侵佔。仍屏息以待。是不啻自己宣佈自己之死刑。此民族任人掠奪其土地一方里而不屑究懲。則人將得寸進尺。非至全國土地皆爲人有。國家亦從此破滅不止。如斯民族。實不配有良好之運命。」</p>
<p>伊氏所賜給我人之敎訓。質言之即曰。惟民族能自起奮鬥。始足以消弭内戰。惟民族能自起奮鬥。始足以享受憲政。惟民族能自起奮鬥。始足以保全國土。不知奮鬥之人民。不配爲法治國之人民。不知奮鬥之民族。不配爲獨立之民族。自九一八以迄於今。已届九月此九月中。國人試返躬自問。所經歷之艱險若何。所自奮發以與命運奮鬥者若何。今後所以圖自存。謀挽救之道又將若何。讀伊氏書能不汗流浹背矍然驚起乎。</p>

<p>並質申報記者陳彬龢君　（一續）</p>
<p>第二因爲復交雖非等於容共、却大有助於共、這又是互有密切的關聯、爲我們討論復交問題者所必須特别注意的一件重要事實、爲明瞭這件事實起見、須從三方面加以説明、頭一方面、我們要明白俄國對遠東的外交政策是怎様、特别要明白俄國對中國的外交政策是怎様、陳君説、「蘇聯在目前亦由進取之外交政策、退而爲防守之外交政策、如與土耳其·德國·阿富汗·里斯亞尼亞·波斯·立陶宛芬·法國等簽訂不平等條約的」、</p>
<p>這段話、有一半是對的、還有一半是不對的、對的一半在什麽地方、即最近幾年來蘇俄對歐美及日本各國確已由進攻的外交政策、轉爲防守的外交政策、因爲從前曾經進攻、迭遭失敗並且引起反感、不得不退守、目前俄國黨機關報曾聲言願與侵略中國的日本簽訂互不侵犯條約、又曾聲言在不得已時、不惜在資本主義國中找與國以制日本、這都是防守外交的表示、</p>
<p>但是俄國對遠東尤其是對中國的外交政策、决不是防守的而仍是進攻的、或者更貼切一點、可用戰術上的名詞、表明目前俄國對華的外交政策、是防禦式的攻進戰略、或攻擊式的防禦戰略、</p>
<p>俄國自共黨執政以來即定下兩條所謂世界革命戰略即俄國的外交戰略、第一條戰略是向資本主義國進攻、聯合無產階級、從内部拆列强的台、第二條戰略是向亞洲各國（日本除外）進攻、聯合弱小民族、從外部搗列强的亂、第一條戰略、在各國試行的結果均相繼失敗、如俄德奥意等國所策動的所謂社會革命、完全失敗、英國曾以俄國在英宣傳共產一度絶交、美國以防止俄國宣傳共產、至今尙未實行與俄復交、俄國感於此條戰略足以使其在國際關係上益陷於孤立、乃與資本主義國家實行妥恊、由進攻轉爲防守、以免根本動搖、但是俄國所抱赤色帝國主義的野心、並未因此放下、乃用避實就虚、乘陷蹈瑕的戰略、移其攻擊的目標集中於中國、以圖赤化整個的中國、這個外交戰略的攻擊目丨丨中國、確是蘇俄外交政策的根本精神所在、中國是帝國主義的次殖民地、自然受一般人的痛恨、於是蘇俄便令共黨呌出打倒帝國主義的口號、以煽動羣衆、蘇俄又説帝國主義是中俄的共同敵人、那無異就是説中國打倒帝國主義的運動不但是爲中國、同時也是爲俄國、更明白點説、蘇俄在中國所指揮的反帝運動、是依據蘇俄對資本主義國家正面防禦、側面攻擊的外交戰略而來、蘇俄正面防禦列强、使其本身得以休養生息、側面反攻擊中國、雖直接受害的是中國、間接受害的也有列强、蘇俄旣可以此戰略鞏固本國、又可以此戰略擊側列强、這不是一個新錦囊妙計嗎、爲俄國設想只有此妙計爲最妙、爲中國設想呢、那就不免爲俄國防禦式的攻擊外交戰略所犧牲了、中國旣爲俄國外交戰略的第一道防線、而且是防禦式的攻擊戰線、無論如何、俄國是要澈底赤化中國的、除非中國不予以澈底赤化的方便、如果中國立即對俄復交、即是予俄國澈底赤化中國的方便、使其完全實現防禦的外交戰略、那裏是什麽中國的「新外交方針」、所以我説立即復交雖非明顯的容共、而實際却大有助於共、</p>
<p>又一方面、我們要明瞭俄與共的密切關係、在蘇俄號稱共產（實際是國家資本主義）由共黨專政、俄與共有極密切的關係、且不必説、在中國的共黨也與俄國有極密切的關係、這又是我們所不能否認的事實、共黨雖然加上中國兩個字做幌子、但實際他是俄國的不是中國的、這可從所謂中國共黨的來源、組織系統以及行動指揮三方面證明、共黨是俄國派人拿錢到中國來組織才產生的、没有俄國就没有像現在的共黨縱有共黨也决不會變成俄國御用的工具、這是共黨的來源、共黨號稱屬於第三國際、而第三國際在實際上是俄國的一個大工具、俄國要怎麽様、第三國際就怎麽様、第三國際要怎様、所謂中國共黨就怎麽様、陳獨秀不服從就打倒陳獨秀、李立三不服從就打倒李立三、陳李都是共黨的首領、然而俄國喊一聲打倒、就不得不倒、這由俄國在共黨的組織和行動指揮上佔最高的權力地位、如果將俄國與共黨强分爲兩個截然無關的東西、不是由於常識缺乏、便是受了俄國宣傳、俄與共旣是兩個極有密切關係的東西、那末立即復交便不免爲共黨張勢、目前共黨正是猖獗的時候、還可立即與俄復交爲共張勢嗎、</p>
<p>再又一方面、我們要明白一經與俄復交便須承認蘇俄中國京都設立公使館並在各通商口岸設立領事館、更須明蘇俄的使館和領館除普通的外交和保僑的使命外、還負有赤化中國的任務、關於這一層、我們只須看看從前的對俄絶交的命令即够證明、十六年十二月撤銷俄領的命令説、</p>
<p>「查國民政府統治下各省之蘇俄領事館及其國營商業機關、恒爲宣傳赤化、藏匿共黨之所、······本月十一日、廣州事變驟起、共黨佔領省垣、斷絶交通、焚燬全市、肆行殺戮、皆由共產黨藉蘇俄領事館及其國營商業機關爲發令指示之地、遂致釀成劇變、勢若燎原、即其他各省地方、亦不無暴動之慮、本政府爲維持治安、預防蔓延起見、······應即將駐在各省之蘇維埃社會聯邦共和國領事一律撤消承認、所有各省之蘇俄國營商業機關一律勒令停止營業、以杜亂源、而便澈究、」</p>
<p>蘇俄利用使領館宣傳赤化、藏匿共黨、指揮暴動等、是鐵一般的事實、在當初絶交的時候、共黨不過只有小規模的暴動、到現在竟有大規模的軍事行動、擁槍十餘萬、占地兩三省、（合湘鄂贛豫皖閩粤桂等省七大匪區而言）官軍竭兩年的力量、尙示肅清一點、（官軍所以不能肅清的原因見民聲二十五期」由江西到湖北」一文、）那里還可以立即對俄復交、又讓俄國遍設使領館、予共黨以供給藏匿和指揮的便利呢、</p>
<p>我們明了俄國的外交戰略是以中國做他的第一道防線、即是以中國做他的犧牲品、又明了俄國與共黨的密切關係以及復交後俄使館領館所予共黨的便利、就可斷定復交雖非容共、却是助共、如果不贊成共產、就不宜於堅决主張立即與俄復交、我與陳君有一日之雅、確知其非共黨亦不贊成殺人放火的共匪、又何以這様堅决主張立即復交、致予共以便利呢、大晚報記者曾君曾質問陳君説、「當初爲什麽要對俄絶交、現在主張復交、是否已解决這些條件、」我們根據上文的討論、應該答復如下、</p>
<p>「當初因爲共黨利用蘇俄使館和領館指揮暴動、宣傳赤化、所以不得不絶交、現在因我國中的毒太深太大、已經暴發於全國、不宜又與俄國設使領館供共黨之用、近於火上添油、揚波助浪、以速中國之亡、故目前尙不宜於立即對俄復交、」（未完）</p>

<p>提出質問　昨日上午、事先由中日代表約定、於上午十時、在九江路美國領事館開會、届時、我方代表俞鴻鈞·日方代表崗崎·　島·均準時到會、討論内容、首由俞氏向日代表提出質問、謂Ｄ區日軍、一再遷延、迄無確實撤退表示、本市市民、頗多懷疑責難、不知貴方究竟何日方可實行撤退、務請確切答復、以敦友誼、至此、日代表崗崎、即起立答復云、Ｄ區在停戰恊定中、原係規定爲日軍暫駐區域、故日軍尙須延長時間、一時恐不能即行撤去云云、</p>
<p>終允撤退　俞氏遂又據理提出二點以反駁之云、照停戰恊定之規定、暫駐區域、祇爲日本陸軍一時不及撤盡、故指定該項地段爲日本陸軍臨時退駐之區</p>
<p>、今日本陸軍已全數歸國、是該項區域、亟應於四星期中、完全交還中國接管、（二）依照恊定、必須於四星期中恢復一二八以前之恹態、是則日軍之撤退、其理已極明顯、今日軍逾期已久、遲遲不撤、中國方面誠以日軍之撤退、事實上或須稍有</p>
<p>準備、故未十分催促、以待貴方保守信義、定期通知、今俟之又久、希望貴方從速將Ｄ區部隊完全撤去、實踐恊定、以重主權、旋日代表沉思有頃、遂改其口吻曰、俟該項部隊稍事準備、當於最短期内、即</p>
<p>行撤退、辯論終結時、已十一時三十分、遂即散會、</p>
<p>四處亦撤　關於公大紗廠·同文書院·日華紗廠·豐田紗廠·四處之日軍、日方早已允於日内撤退、但至昨日仍未實行、致外間又有四處日軍尙成問題之説、同時日方反宣傳、謂四處日軍、决不撤退、（見上海每日新聞）但據共同委員會俞鴻鈞表示、謂四處日軍、日方已允撤退、當然撤退、不成問題、又日僑請求組織巡邏隊一節、據調查亦非事實、</p>
<p>淞委呈文　吳淞市政委員唐承宗·劉梓文·昨呈吳市長云、呈爲懇請交涉早撤退職區日軍、以安人心而利復興事、竊自恊定告成、吳淞區域、已由吾言接管、人民逐漸遷回、蓋屋居住、約計鄉區佔十之九、而鎭區祇十之三、考其原因、實由鎭西華豐紗廠、尙駐有日本海軍陸戰隊數十名、人民經此浩劫、有如驚弓之鳥、而日海軍所駐地點、近在咫尺、無怪人民之裹足不前、又况無業流民、故意謠諑頻興、以圖擾亂、而無知愚民、益覺恐慌萬狀、是日軍一日不盡撤、即人民一日不安居、委員等聞見所及、未便自甘緘默、爲此備文呈請鈞長、嚴重交涉、務使駐在華豐紗廠内之日海軍陸戰隊、早日撤盡、以安人心而利復興、迫切上陳、仰祇核奪施行、謹呈、</p>

<p>宋任决於本月終結束完竣</p>
<p>國聞社云、上海兵工廠奉軍政部令停辦、並由處理委員會命、將原有兵工機器分配金陵漢陽鞏縣三兵工廠、現在宋式　任内任務、决於本月終結束完竣、對以後處置事務、則由處理委員會負責辦理、至其停辦原因、昨經記者探悉、茲誌其槪略如下、</p>
<p>停辦經過　該廠自清季李鴻章時代、購虹口某西人機器造船廠而改造、幾經擴充、及移至高昌廟、迄今已五六十年、此次滬戰突發、工人遣散、祇留砲廠、照常工作、迨戰事敉平前兩星期、工會方面、爲維持計、曾兩度派代表向京軍事委員會軍政部及兵工署等機關、請求復工、聞代表至軍委會、求見蔣委員長時、蔣語以事關軍事行政範圍、諭向軍政部謀辦法、轉至軍部、告以三星期内必可復工、並上峰經費、亦已核定、月給八萬元、故結果非常圓滿、詎上月部派西顧問布魯麥來滬、視察該廠、受戰事狀况後、迨返去、布氏以商埠附近、不宜設兵工機關、矧十四年滬人士有遷移主張、故詳細條陳於軍事委員會、經該會提出討論、僉以所陳無誤、遂由蔣委員長批准照辦、是即該廠停辦遷併之經過情形、</p>
<p>處理善後　該廠善後處理委員會、業已在京開議、惟委員人選、與昨報載稍有出入、蓋該會委員額定八、除金陵兵工廠長李承幹、漢陽兵工廠長黄公柱·上海兵工廠長·宋式　　、另由兵工署材料委員會中推派一人、會同兵工署設計總務審核監查四科長辦理、</p>
<p>目下狀况　該廠戰前、共有職工四千餘、嗣以戰事發生、遣裁職工十分之力、至今不足四百名、經調查所得、現下製砲廠有工人一百八十餘、製槍製槍彈製砲彈製藥及機器五廠、每廠各十二名、各處科職員六十餘、其餘裁剩警衛隊一中隊卅餘、共三百四五十名而已、</p>
<p>工會意旨　國聞社記者昨向工會方面探詢意旨、工人以前星期晋京請願結果甚佳、今突遭變化、實出意料、現工會擬以三種理由、繼續呈請政府、（一）滬廠機器、分搬金陵漢陽鞏縣、該三處工廠房須新造、不如免動、（二）杭州機器運返上海、路近、比較便利、（三）舍舊有裝架機器基礎、而從新建築、需費浩大、但政府已在具體進行、恐難挽回、至廠方前晚派審檢處長胡嗣鴻等三人晋京、係向部説明歷來情形、非去請求收回成命云、</p>
<p>命令未到　大通社記者、昨往兵工廠訪謁廠長宋式　氏、宋派該廠文書科長張伯初君代表延見、據張氏談、本廠是否停辦、軍政部與兵工署之命令尙未到逹、在未奉到命令以前、自當照常工作、以維現狀、至審檢處長胡嗣鴻等赴京任務、鄙人並無所知云、</p>
<p>黨部援助　兵工廠内、附設有中國國民黨上海市區二十五·二十八·三十·三十一·各分部、黨員多爲該廠工友、自得該廠停辦消息後、即紛紛集議、呈請上級黨部轉呈中央、請飭軍部撤回前議、恢復工作、</p>

<p>罷委會昨日議决</p>
<p>今日起忍痛復工</p>
<p>租界電話公司工人罷工後、罷工委員會以一部份工人、擅自復工、加以環境惡劣、昨命令全體工人、今日起、忍痛復工、並發表宣言、準備第二次奮鬭、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>復工增加　自前晨福建路新中央行·畢勛路法南行·海寗路北行·等少數工人復工後前晚各工　與公司工程師威爾遜接洽、四出勸告工人復工、同時捕房增派大批中西探捕、分駐各分行、保護復工、并驅逐愛文義路通商旅館八十五號之罷委接洽處、以致工人與罷委不能互通聲氣、　日起、江西路總公司·福建路·海寗路·滙山路·麥特赫司脱路·楊樹浦·畢勛路·億定盤路·　體尼蔭路·等分行工人、先後進公司復工者、　占全體總數十分之七、</p>
<p>禁止開會　罷工委員會、原定昨日上午十時、在遠東飯店五百十三號集合、舉行緊急大會、討論繼續罷工與否、以便採用有效辦法、對付公司、及至上午八時三十分、公共租界捕房、派大批中西探捕、前往制止、并將罷工工人驅逐、通知遠東飯店賬房、禁止借給電話工人爲辦事處、於是罷工工人、退出罷委臨時大會、改在遠東飯店門前馬路旁、繼續開會討論、但又爲捕房阻止、以致羣衆大會無法舉行</p>
<p>緊急會議　罷工委員會、鑒於羣衆大會、爲捕房阻止、於上午十一時、在福建路茶樓舉行緊急會議、到江西路福建路等行罷工工人一百餘人、首由主席報告目前情形、和罷工趨勢、環境甚惡劣、繼即開始討論、罷工工人均以工頭欺騙、壓迫工人上工、主張以武力對付、對於公司、决用破壞手段、擁護罷委會、繼續罷工、罷委會以大部份工人、已擅自復工、罷工趨勢已告慘敗、勸令忍痛復工、當塲議决、（一）忍痛復工（二）發表宣言（三）準備第二次奮鬭、最後高呼口號而散、</p>
<p>罷委命令　罷工委員會發命令云、工友們我們這次罷工、因爲工賊走狗的破壞、帝國主義捕房的壓迫、和工友們内部團結的不堅固、不能吸引大多數工友在罷委之下工作、以至今日罷工、是不能堅持了、所以我們不得不忍痛復工、保存我們的實力、以準備下次更堅决的罷工、望各工友於今日下午及明日早晨、一律有組織的復工、堅固本身的組織、反抗資方的進攻準備爭取下次的勝利、此佈、上海電話公司職工罷工委員會、六月二十一日、</p>
<p>復工宣言　全上海的工友們、各界的民衆們、我們三千餘電話工人、爲着本身利益的條件、向美帝國主義資本家舉行罷工、已有十三天了、但是因爲帝國主義巡捕房的壓迫、禁止我們的會議、監視我們的機關、逮捕我們的工友、及工賊走狗的破壞、工頭欺騙恐嚇工人上工、破壞工人的團結、同時工人内部組織不健全、團結不堅强、罷委没有包括各行各部的工人代表、與羣衆的關係不密切、不能吸收多數工友來參加罷委的工作、未能及時組織羣衆、向敵人進攻所以我們雖然從罷委中、把那些動搖妥恊主張無條件復工及請求官廳黨部「仲裁調解」破壞罷工的腐化份子、驅逐出去、可是我們依然没有發動更廣大的羣衆的積極行動、以取得罷工的勝利、我們在帝國官廳的壓迫和工賊走狗的破壞之下、這次罷工是失敗了、我們雖然没有得到條件的勝利、但我們三千工友英勇的鬥爭、是給予美帝國主義資本家以很大又很有意義的打擊、我們在罷工期中、學得了很多的弳騐和敎訓、我們認清了工頭等都是帮助資本家來破壞我們罷工的、我們只有建立包含各行各部積極工人代表的强有力的罷工委員會、堅决發動羣衆的積極行動、肅清工賊走狗、堅持地向資本家進攻、才能爭得我們的勝利、我們雖然上工了、但是條件没有得到、同時資本家及一切工賊走狗、必然更另緊的向我們進攻、開除我們工人、所以我們的鬥爭、雖没有結果、我們要繼續爭取我們的條件、我們絲毫不能放棄鬥爭的武器、要繼續團結我們的力量、則用這次罷工的敎訓、改正我們的錯誤和缺點、準備下一次更堅决更偉大的鬥爭和罷工、失敗是成功之母、我們不喪氣、不消極、將繼續與全上海工友及民衆團結一致、爭取我們共同的勝利、反對共同的敵人、我們非常感激各界對於我們這次罷工的援助、但我們還希望各界、繼續的援助我們、我們始終站在全上海工人一起、反對帝國主義資本家、我們最後的口號、是（一）打倒破壞罷工的工賊走狗（二）準備下一次的罷工、（三）反對資本家向我們進攻、反對開除工人、要求增加工資、恢復禮拜工、照發罷工期内工資、鞏固我們的團結、組織電話工人自己的工會、（四）全上海的工友團結起來、（五）打倒帝國主義資本家、電話工人罷工委員會、六月二十一日</p>
<p>公司通告　上海電話公司昨日通告云、多數工人、現已復工、公司方面、因有充分職工、維持業務、其餘人員、公司方面、現限六月二十三日復工、否則另行補充、或予撤消、其未復工者、六月二十三日以後、將取銷工資、其損壞機関工人、業已開作矣</p>

<p>浙江委兼建設廳長曾養甫、爲完成杭江鐵路借欵事宜、於前日來滬、向企信銀團繼續洽商一切、華東社記者特訪晤曾氏於旅次、据談杭江路進行槪况、曁救濟新陳繭絲这放欵辦法頗詳、茲紀各情如下、</p>
<p>杭江鐵路借欵　據曾氏談、完成杭江鐵路、原定計劃、係自金華起、繼續興築、路逕湯溪等三縣而逹江山、江山縣至贛之廣豐、此段公路、早經築成、可以貫通、至江山至福建邊境各縣、本省（即浙省）府亦經咨請閩省會同興築、以利勦匪、故完成杭江鐵路、對於浙省及贛東閩北治安關係至大、自金華起至江山、占全線長約一百六十八公里、建築以及材料經費、預計需欵七百萬元、而浙省建設經費、年祇三十萬、故不得不從事籌集、日前杭江路局長杜震遠、特因此事赴京、接洽庚欵二十萬磅、（約華幣三百四十萬元）業經庚欵委員會委員長朱家　氏允許、本人此次來滬、關係於工程經費、擬向企信銀團、以杭州電廠讓渡、可得一百萬元、已得銀團非正式之認可、惟利息方面、銀團須一分以上、本人則主張最高一分、大約再度商洽後、即可圓滿成約、</p>
<p>救濟陳繭陳絲　關於推銷江浙兩省陳繭陳絲、本廳前曾會同江蘇實業廳、議定會同撥銀四百萬兩、以貼補江浙兩省絲繭商、推銷陳繭陳絲之損失、無如浙省省庫拮据萬分、但救濟目前絲繭之衰落、又</p>
<p>屬急不容緩之舉、故本人曾擬具計劃、會同蘇省、先發行救濟絲繭庫券二百二十萬兩、自二十一年六月一日、爲發行之期、月息五厘、以五十個月爲限、本息完全清償、浙省方面、即以中央月撥省方因裁厘而損失之十五萬元恊欵、但爲担保基金、此項計劃、業由江浙兩省府會呈財政部、本人前曾因此一度來滬、對於發行庫券、救濟絲繭辦法、已徴得財長宋子文氏同意、而財部亦於日前電復浙省、准予發行、惟發行之章程條例及還本付息表等、須由財部呈請行政院咨請立法院正式通過後、始可實行、</p>
<p>救濟新絲新繭　至於救濟新繭新絲問題、前曾向浙省商界磋商、籌欵一百八十</p>

<p>三十三</p>
<p>我説；「朱先生要我做一個大徒弟，我倒是很情願的，但只是會的敎人，不會的跟人學，似乎不必分什麽大小。至於師傅這把交椅，那就請先生老實不客氣的坐了起來，用不着推讓。」</p>
<p>朱先生説；「廣義的説起來，不但是徒弟没有大小，就是師傅與徒弟的區别也不能分得清楚。就拿我來説吧。我有些事情能做你的師傅，有些事情倒要做你的徒弟。不説别的，只説那敲鐘一件事，我就該拜你做師傅。莫説我應該拜你做師傅，世界上不必拜你做師傅的人就不多見咧。」</p>
<p>朱先生這番話倒説中了我的心眼。年靑的人，誰不歡喜聽人恭維呢？我知道朱先生决不是要在我心裏撒下幾粒驕傲的種子。他只是拿一件淺近的事證明師生間是没有嚴格的界限。不過我必得留神，不要因爲敲鐘一件小事受人恭維就眞的擺起師傅的架子。我將來就做了師傅，還要肯得虚心做人徒弟，纔有長進的希望咧。朱先生辦學如韓信點兵，多多益善，我是贊同。但是招收一歲的嬰兒，總不以爲然。最後我只得老老實實的提出質問；「先生要招收嬰兒，最好是重新考慮一下。您看，這些嬰兒來了之後，一天到晚，哭囉，抱囉，餓囉，尿囉，屎囉，先生一手包辦吧，如何忙得了，呌大徒弟帮忙吧，誰情願？」</p>
<p>朱先生説；「這個你不必顧慮，我有現成的徒弟。這徒弟便是每個嬰兒自己的母親。我們敎了每個母親便是敎了每個嬰兒。」我説；「這也有困難。我們村莊裏風氣不開通。先生是個男子怎麽好去敎導女人？一旦瓜田李下，有了閑話，可不是小事呀。」</p>
<p>朱先生説；「女人敎女人總行得通吧？我看宋老太倒不錯。如果她老人家肯出來領導，還有問題嗎？我們帮她老人家的忙總該没有閑話吧？我説；「那是保險了。可是先生爲什麽要急急的從嬰兒敎育下手？」朱先生説；「小孩子的情感，習慣，傾向在六歲以前如果培養的不得當，將來要改那可費事啦。比如怕鬼是一種最不合理的情感，幾乎完全是婦女們造謠造成功的。結果呢？小時怕鬼，終向怕鬼。六歲以前的敎育是多麽的重要啊！所以要培養小學生，先須培養幼稚生，更須培養嬰兒，即須培養嬰兒的母親，那纔是根本的辦法咧。不注重母敎而要想把小學辦好，比如是水中撈月如何可能？」</p>

<h3 id="c181">童子口中的吃黨同志 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>吃字的效用很廣，做什麽生意，呌做吃什麽飯：擺賭攤的希望統吃，講交際的只怕弗色頭；其他，做學生的，每逢考試以後，紛紛私議，某人一定吃Ａ，某人一定吃Ｂ，吃Ｃ，吃Ｄ。</p>
<p>吃敎和信敎有别，若把信敎的人，喚做吃敎；那人是一定要反對的。誰料，吃敎以外，現在又多了吃黨兩個字的名稱。創造吃敎名詞的，不指忠實敎徒，指的是借着敎字哄飯吃的。由此類推，凡是吃黨的人物，大槪也不是忠實黨員，不過借着黨字哄飯吃罷了；我想，黨的裏面，須得没有一個吃黨的人物，才可以保持黨的威嚴，歷久不變。</p>
<p>有一位朋友講給我聽一個新笑話：</p>
<p>某省，有一個忠實同志，喚做姜緜。丨丨是不是這兩個字，未可肯定；横豎是笑話，隨意寫兩個字便算了。</p>
<p>秉緜加入政黨以後，努力於黨的工作，絶對不是靠黨吃飯的人物。一天，姜緜路過一條小巷，聽得裏面的兒童高呼着：吃黨同志姜緜！吃黨同志姜緜！</p>
<p>他聽了，不禁氣憤，本人是個忠實同志，何物小子！竟敢直呼其名，道他一聲吃黨同志！</p>
<p>他氣吽吽的跑到裏面，待要和那小子打交涉；但是，一經調查，不覺失笑；原來那小子正在讀論語，讀的是：闕黨童子將命！闕黨童子將命！</p>
<h3 id="c182">十九路軍的箬帽 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 永存</p>
<p>十九路軍的箬帽這次，不獨給日人一個永久深刻的認識，同時給世界人士一個認識，日人現近出版一本「十九路軍的寫眞」也畫一頂箬帽做廣告，可見他們受了十九路軍一個大敎訓之後，就牢牢的認着這箬帽，也許以後他們覺着箬帽是一件可畏可恨而又可敬的東西了！</p>
<p>許多外國人以爲箬帽是十九路軍的特製軍帽，以爲它也像外國鋼皮軍帽一般的可以避鎗彈，甚至許多中國人也有同様的見解，其實這種箬帽是廣東農人很通行的一種帽，尤其是中山縣的農人，男的女的無論晴天雨天出門就戴着它，他們呌做銅鼓帽，每頂不過二三角錢，可以禦日也可以遮雨，它是用兩層細竹編成，當中夾着葵葉，農人買了一頂之後，多數把自己的名字寫在上面，再化三五分銀加上一層熟桐油，那就更加光亮耐用了，（圩市上有一種人專門挑着熟桐油的擔子，替人家油帽度日的，）在帽的裏沿上加上兩條帶，戴上頭時將帶收緊，風吹不掉，不用時將帶放鬆，掛在背後，一點都不碍工作，價廉耐用兼而有之，可算是廣東農人的一種恩物，十九路軍喜歡用它，大約因爲他們多是廣東人，又因它是一件實用的東西，戴在辛勤的農人的頭上你能給他們安適，戴在愛國的兵士的頭上，你能給敵人一個大大的敎訓，與提高我們國際的地位，箬帽呀！我們永久敬愛你！（不受酬）</p>

<p>邇得留美友人來函。謂自一二八滬　旣作。我軍捷報。不絶傳至美國。全國大小報紙。紛以大字標題華軍抗敵消息。莫謂我旅美僑胞。皆歡欣鼓舞。即美國公正人民，亦莫不精神奮發。譽爲東方睡獅。欠伸而作。某夕。我友糾集友人數十。假座某咖啡座。討論資助淞滬抗日軍事。有一名小説家於隔座。詢知此數十華僑。方恊議救國捐事。忽要求略事演講。我友許之。小説家即起立而言。其語頗多勗勉之辭。中有數語云。我人見有二人相鬥於道者。必出而非解。因二强相鬥。必有一傷。其一旣傷。則日後必圖報復。是未免永無寗息之日矣。若一强一弱相鬥。强者猛毆弱者。弱者不圖抵抗。則儘可任令强者毆死弱者。可無後患之虞矣。日佔中國東北。中國不抗而退。是强弱之鬥也。今日軍侵滬。華軍力抗。是二强之鬥也。我美國人民。當督促政府。加以干預。斷不能再袖手而旁觀矣。我深望在滬華軍。抗拒到底。則列强必出而爲中國助。以底於成焉云云。由此亦足覘上海砲聲之偉大。已越太平洋。而震醒美國人矣。某日。我友就食於一小食肆。鄰座有數美國人。方侈談淞滬之戰。頗多鄙夷日人之語。嗣见吾友。誤爲日本人。遂紛紛加以慰藉。吾友亟告以並非日籍。實一堂堂之中國人。彼輩乃爭先與我友握手。舉杯爲壽。其勢利有如此者云云。上述二則。雖係瑣聞之一。然從此我人當永誌勿忘此光榮偉大之淞滬之戰。蓋我國僑民。居留海外。從未受人之尊視。所得而吐氣揚眉者。此猶爲數十年來第一遭也。</p>

<p>魚類之中。很有許多奇怪的。</p>
<p>緣木求魚　孟子對齊宣王説。「以若所爲。求若所殺。猶緣木而求魚也。」意思是説緣木求魚是辦不到的事。不料世界上居然有緣木而登的魚類。這種魚產在東印度。可以鰓蓋外面的小鈎。攀登樹幹。</p>
<p>發電之魚　人類千辛萬苦。經過多少科學家工程家的心思勞力。才好容易造成了發電機。却不知自然界中竟有一種魚類。毫不費事的能自動放出電來。這種魚產在南美洲和非洲的河内。</p>
<p>魚飛機　鳥能飛魚能游。這是人人皆知的事實。但是反過來説。鳥能游魚能飛。也未嘗不可。從上海搭輪船往歐美的乘客在洋面常可以看見飛魚。</p>
<p>魚發彈　東印度有一種魚類。可從口内吐出水珠將昆蟲擊落水中。和我國小説上描寫的劍俠口吐白光差不多。</p>
<p>魚燈　深海之底。陽光不到。眞是所謂「天错地黑。日月無光。」生在這裏的魚類。却能自己發光。以爲黑暗中的導引。</p>
<p>涸澤之魚　澤雖涸。有的魚却不見得死。非洲產的肺魚。平常游於水中。遇到天乾水涸。便藏在泥中。呼吸空氣生活</p>

<p>— 劉豁公</p>
<p>王少樓此番來滬。極受看客的歡迎。他的頑藝兒的確不錯。可是就我的眼光看來。要算盜魂鈴最爲特别而有趣。他這齣戲。是採老戲新唱辦法的。開塲用「廻龍閣」的龍鳳閣内把衣換一句西皮倒板上。接唱西皮原板。乃是「斬子」的楊延昭下位去迎接娘來。「探母」的我好比南來雁失羣飛散。「南陽關」的嘆雙親不由人珠涙雙抛。「珠簾寨」的憶昔當年五鳳樓。「慶頂珠」的爭奈我家貧窮無計奈何。「奇冤報」的霎時間烏雲把天掩。「法門寺」大面劉瑾的少一名將人頭縣掛高竿。接着就表白八戒奉了猴王之命。來探獅駝嶺。因爲路遠體乏持地唱戲解悶。隨唱「敎子」王春娥的老薛保你不必苦苦哀告。······薛保的勸三娘休得要珠涙雙掉。······又春娥的你道他年紀小心不小······三段。以一人兼作生旦。並且接速着唱。聽的人固覺有味。唱的人可就累了。以下是「义曲」風雨歸舟。唱得很有常澍田的味兒。接着就作「别姬」的劍舞。舞法是梅蘭芳親授的。當然格外的受看。舞罷來兩個鷂子翻身。就手直躺下去。起來走花梆子下。再上用大面腔。唱西皮垜板。那一日打從那烏雲洞過的盜鈴原詞。後見旦角（就是母獅子）作滑稽表白。也很有趣。接着盜假鈴。和羣妖開打。大耍鐵扒。見土地。又有一大段滑稽表白。然後變小八戒下。最後隨猴子上雙進陣。扳朝天櫈弔毛。做得非常熱鬧。再由美猴上。拖着它的腰下去。這齣戲纔算完了。一般伶工的盜魂鈴。可没有這様唱的。所以我説他特别有趣。「謂予不信」。請你自己去看罷。</p>

<p>那值日的承啓官。裂着牙。泚著嘴。微微表現了點笑意。對安玉田略點了頭。便算是一禮全收。聊伸謝悃。隨又討過一張名片。高高用手舉起。向門外努了努嘴道。請吧。安玉田忙别過了那萬金生。就大大客廳時。無意的向兩邊瞟了幾眼。見還是昨天那様濟濟多士肅靜無譁的情景。他却已平步登天。不會再刷落在這裏當木化石的陳列品了。不禁觸起一些今昔之感。並很奇怪的想到這一般枯坐無聊的可憐人。當是不如他有那様一個賢内助代爲籌畫。才天天來俊幹這種苦事。便又覺得自己是很幸福。那些人也很可憐憫了呢。從這承啓處門外。轉到後邊。進了一座鐵門坎似的二門。有兩個武裝衛士把守着。掳那承啓官説。這兒若没有他們領導。誰也不能進來。除非是最有聲勢的現任軍師長及本衙門各處各大頭腦等類。安玉田感領盛情。肅然起敬。再穿過一個大院落。迎面有一排高大的房屋。由四名背手提式機槍的衛士分列在台堦上。走進到屋裏面。逕奔東首一間。那便是葉督軍的簽押房。有多少人縱候上一年半載也輕易　能踏進。但天下事説難便難。説易便易。那承啓官只把門窗掀起。向内通報了一聲安參議到。却何嘗要什黀片子。安玉田也就誠惶誠恐的擺進去了。葉作章穿着軍服。坐在一張大寫字台的轉椅上。一眼瞥見了安玉田。笑嘻嘻的招了招手。安玉田忙鞠了一躬。走到那寫字台邊站着。葉作章張嘴便問。你太太來了嗎。安玉田回答説在旅館裏。葉作章便又道。可常到衙門來玩玩呀。説着。樂得把一個小身體在椅子中只簸動。隨後又談了些旅館裏方便不方便的問話。安玉田才斗膽呈上一個　摺。請求批准招收軍隊的事項。葉作章慨然提筆便批。派安玉田爲招收專員。限一個月内成立。俟點騐槍枝人數後。再酌委軍職。並指着對面椅上一個掛中將肩牌的軍官呌參謀長道。這公事就交你去辦。安玉田喜逐顔開。連忙兩面鞠躬稱謝隨後又有别人來見葉作章講話了。安玉田退到一旁。細看這室中布置。只見滿牆掛着照片鏡匡。和幾副當代總統總理親筆對聯。也没什麽可看。就悄悄走出。忙回家去報喜信。欲知後事如何。且看下回分解。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>法律條文之不明瞭，致引起法官與當事人的誤會，其事例至夥，我天然不能一一提出加以討論，茲姑舉一例，</p>
<p>據昨日報載，有配偶對重婚不得自訴一案，深爲詫異，我原是不曾研究過法律的人，天然不懂法律的奥妙，不過拿理來講，拿情來講，其不得自訴的理由何在，眞令人百思而莫得其解，</p>
<p>據説，刑事訴訟法第三百三十九條，有明文規定，其條文謂「前二項之規定，於直系親屬配偶或同財共居親屬之間，不適用之，」的確這條文上明規定，配偶不得自訴，但是爲什麽不得自訴，在很簡單的條文上，未曾加以説明，大約立法者的意思，此種案件，關於國家法益，或妨碍風化，必須由檢察官提起公訴，</p>
<p>但是在刑事訴訟法第三百四十條，又説「同一案件，經自訴者，不得再向檢察官或司法警察官告訴，」若照兩條文連帶解釋起來，凡同一案件，必須向檢察官請求提起公訴，若已經自訴者，不得再向檢察官或司法警察官告訴，並無法院絶對不能受理自訴的規定，若單獨照第三百四十條文講，該條文云，經自訴者，不得再向檢察官告訴，這口氣明明是公訴案件，若已經自訴者，不得再向檢察官請求提起公訴，以免一案兩訴，其理甚明，</p>
<p>重婚之罪，祗有配偶人直接最受痛苦，本來直系尊親，應該有權可以告訴，在在婚姻自由制度之下，父母自然不來管他們的賬，惟有出於自訴之一途，故重婚之罪，配偶不自出來告訴，還是請叔叔伯伯出來告訴呢，</p>
<p>而法律曰，重婚案件，須向檢察官請求公訴，惟在特殊的租界情形之下，此種案件，原是數見不鮮的事，未知法院是否一律駁回，還是有受理有不受理，倘是一律不受理的話，則凡在租界上犯重婚罪者，受害人天然呼籲無門，在情理上原是説不過去，若説須請工部局提起公訴，更是不解，從前政府拚命地欲收回租界裁判權不知是什麽意思，而現在華人對於華人訴訟案件，推出不管，還要向工部局去請求辦法，我眞是不懂哩，</p>

<p>— 玉庭</p>
<p>電是一種萬能的東西，也是在世界上不可缺少的要素，并且在這電氣興盛的時代中，我們要利用牠和知道牠的究竟，那我們至少也應該有電氣普通的常　　是，現在我把電氣内三種重要的電表名稱，和　們的用途寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）安培表（Ａｍｐｅｒｅｍｅｔｅｒ）（二）伏脱表（ＶｏｌｔＭｅｔｅｒ）（三）歐姆表（Ｏｈｍｍｅｔｅ）</p>
<p>測量電流，是用安培表。測量電壓（或稱電位差）和起電力，用伏脱表。測量電阻（或稱抵抗），用歐姆表·</p>
<p>再經歐姆氏的研究，知道電阻的大小與電流是反比例，與電位的差是正比例，我們假設Ｖ爲電位的差，Ａ爲電流的數量，Ｒ爲電阻的大小，就可以成立一個後邊那様的分式：</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>R=-</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>我們知道了上面那個分式，就可用代數的法則，列出後邊的兩個分式：</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>A=-　　V=AR</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>上面三個分式，是歐姆氏創造出來的，所以我們把這種的法則，稱之爲歐姆的法則·</p>

<p>前天和小弟弟到先施買了些東西回來，經過一條衖堂，忽然來了兩個小孩子，手裏拿着一疊印着鉛字的傳單式的白紙，笑嬉嬉的給我們每人一張，我本來最恨是有人發傳單給我，平時在馬路上什麽傳單都不接受的，因爲那天看見這兩位小孩子，年齡很小，非常活潑而天眞，所以受了好奇心的催促，要知道他們發傳單的用意，才接來一看，但不看還好，看了眞使我不值一笑，傳單上寫着·</p>
<p>「××地方發現了劉伯温的石碑，今年中國各地要大亂，××幾省水災，××幾省兵災，××幾省瘟疫，······」</p>
<p>總之照這傳單上看來，是中國全境，今年將没有一片乾凈土了，下面印着似通非通的那些句子，無非是，</p>
<p>「一愁有飯無人吃，二愁有衣無人穿，三愁有路無人走，四愁······</p>
<p>五愁······以至十愁·」</p>
<p>下面還有三道靈符，説是畫在門上，可以避免災難，而如果每人能把這種傳單印來分送，做做好事，便可消災延壽，否則今年十人之中，會死掉九人而連鷄犬都死得不剩了，</p>
<p>走過去在衖口的牆壁上，又發現了同様的傳單，貼在上面，隔了没有幾天，傳單愈弄愈多了，我們每次走出去，都有人分送，而衖堂的牆壁上，也到處是這種傳單了，不多幾時之後，隔壁的張太太，對過的李太太，······都在託人印這種傳單來分送了·</p>
<p>今年×月裏要混沌而天黑了，×月裏要大死人了，這一類的無稽之談，本來時常有得聽見的，不值識者的一笑·但偏有這般老太太們，聽見了這種消息，信以爲眞，東告訴，西打聽，而結果除了口頭勸人爲善以外，還要印發傳單</p>
<p>·</p>
<p>本來上海的太太們，整天吃飽了飯，没有事做，坐在家裏也覺得氣悶，有了這種謠言，她們才得到了談話的資料，而同時還驚慌失措，好像大難將臨，至於發發傳單，有錢的太太，自然不在乎，没錢也許會省些出來印傳單，······這也是上海太太的一種消遣吧·</p>
<p>在太太們爭先奪後，印送傳單的時候，運道最好的，是一般印刷店了·</p>

<p>前天，遇見多年不見的老友趙君，當然少不得互問近狀，我問他説，「許久不見，近　得意在那裏？」他説「無所謂得意，不過在一隻小學堂裏，當一個敎書匠罷了，」我説，「當敎師倒很清閒，不像我做那筆墨生活，終日案牘勞形的没有一刻兒空閒！」他説，「當敎書匠，果然比較的清閒，但也有時不甚好做哩，遇到頑皮的學生，作弄起來，就没有辦法，他們每每在字典裏，找了那些奇怪的生冷的字或僻典來詢問，做先生的，一時回答不出，就得給他們嘲笑，豈不難堪？」我聽了笑着道，「這纔呌做」張天師被鬼迷，有法變没法」了，」他聽了也笑了，我們於是就在這笑聲中，握手而别。</p>
<p>我回到了家裏，想起趙君的話，使我回憶到幼時，在敝鄉（湖州）一隻小學堂裏讀書，那位國文敎師，倒是一個富有國學根底的學究，一天，他老先生在講解完畢後，因爲離下課的時候還早，他就敎大家把所講的那一篇看一遍，如有不甚了解的地方，可以問他，於是有某同學，綽號呌「遠年花鵰，」素喜頑皮，他不看正文，却看字典，在字典裏找了「鍚」「茶」「壼」三個字，寫了去問那個富有國學根底的敎師，説是「什麽字？」那國文敎師向那同學道，「這三個字，你還不認識嗎？就是「雪」「查」「胡，」是一種錫質做的茶壼，」那同學於是假扮正經道，「怎麽我方纔在字典裏考查過，這三字呌陽·塗·悃·我因爲還有些疑惑不解，所以寫出來問先生，如今先生説「這三個字，是唸「雪」「查」「胡，」是一種錫質做的茶壼，」那末，這想必是字典的錯了，」那國文敎師聽那學生這般一説，於是再把那「鍚」「茶」「壼」三個字仔細一看，原來較那「錫」「茶」「壼」三個字，各多上一筆，若不請敎字典，倒實在有些不甚認識哩，當時我瞧那國文敎師的神情，眞是窘態可掬，令人發噱！這就是趙君所説的「學生考先生，」未免予先生以難堪了</p>

<p>一次，爲着家裏有了病人，免不掉要請位醫生來瞧瞧，名醫吧，須要多量的金錢才夠得到「仰瞻」或「降臨」，否則「侯門深如海」，只好「蕭郎是路人」，要是想要緊些「速駕」，更難乎其難了，不管你病人焦急得像鍋上蟻，恭候得頭頸絲瓜長，他依然是姗姗其來遲，名醫是如是如是，那末只有不請敎，好得病人還是小毛病，將就些請一位住在鄰近，向不出名門庭冷落的醫生來，一則價錢便宜，二來易請易到，主意打定，馬上照行，滿意半小時内，可以「辱承枉顧」，那裏知道三小時過了去，還是一人面不知何處去」的「芳蹝杳然」，懷疑地使我想到他不要現在也紅了？生意忙了吧？最後畢竟是要來的，醫生來了！只見他氣喘喘地跑得面紅耳赤，聽他自己的宣佈，知道剛從某處某處診了病，才到這裏，匆匆的看了病人，又忙忙的開了藥方，重由他自己的宜佈，現在還要到某處某處赴診，於是見他很急促去了，醫生去了，我想「磚瓦也有翻身日」一位向無人問津的醫生，居然出會紅了起來，</p>
<p>隔不多天，我有一位和那醫生熟悉的朋友來找我談天，無意中講到那位醫生，我就問他，</p>
<p>「你可知道他怎麽着一來，竟會時來運凑，生意這般忙？」</p>
<p>「這話從那裏來的？」我的朋友問我，</p>
<p>於是我告訴他這様的一回事，不料我那朋友，竟撲剌地對我笑了起來，接着又説，</p>
<p>你也會上他的圈套，這是他的宣傳大綱，完全是一種生意經呢，</p>
<p>生夢死</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>電影已進行了一半，　休息十分鐘的時候，幾個朝夕相處的某藝術，團體的靑年＋藝術們在一排兒的坐着，等候這「歐洲首屈一指的美艶女明星愛娜安特拉主演，絶頂趣艶奇跡偉搆的捷足先吻（ＡｎｎｙＯｎｋｒａｉｎ；Ａｌｌｆｏｒｋｉｓｓ“（」繼續開映。</p>
<p>這個片子的妙處正如該電影院所宣傳的那様；「將西方女子的不羈態度，完全搬到銀幕上來，有意想不到之奇妙，···」這是主張極羰戀愛自由的密司特Ａ所十分讚揚的。甚至他膽敢將戲中的女主角比擬了他所心醉的密司吳·於是他以一般詩人所特有調子呌着：</p>
<p>「啊！這簡直是爲我們的安琪兒寫照喲！多麽逼眞呀。」</p>
<p>「我們的密司吳嗎？ＯｈｌＮｏ老Ａ，你不能這様侮辱她，你有什麽理由來咒咀她呢？」以戲劇自命綽號野狗的小陳有如讀台詞似的操着純粹的國語。</p>
<p>「對了，眞是太没道理，難道她不愛你，你便要侮辱她的人格嗎？」漂亮的小説家簡直在生氣了。接上老Ａ又説：</p>
<p>「Ｗｈｏｓａｙｓｏ？她不愛我？我才眞的不睬她哩。」</p>
<p>「恐怕不見得吧？」靑年美術家也夾了上來：「她是那様的美麗，桃緋的兩頰，深紅欲滴的嘴唇，誰能不爲她動情呢？假如我不是有了愛人，我都會愛上她的。」</p>
<p>「對呀，誰不知道？一天到晚像狗似的追着，瞞得過誰呢？」又是野狗説。於是老Ａ直的老羞成怒，居然破口大駡··</p>
<p>「放屁！你才眞是野狗哩！」</p>
<p>這時最右邊的聲樂家陶少爺却突然提着洪亮的喉音説：</p>
<p>「大家都不用説，你們都是些跑狗塲的狗，拚命的追着前面的電兎，誰的本頂高，誰便跑在最前面，可是電兎始終是追不着的，徒然是枉費心機罷了。」</p>
<p>「·········」</p>
<p>忽然此時電燈暗了，美麗的女郎又在他們眼前妞妮的出現，於是大家都得集精會神的來對付這目前的幻影了。</p>
<h3 id="c209">做了五分鐘的漢奸 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 鴻</p>
<p>舊同學Ｔ君到校中來望我，剛纔坐定，便帶笑地向我道：</p>
<p>「倒做了五分鐘的漢奸！嘗着了做漢奸的風味！」誰做了？漢奸，漢奸！還分五分鐘十分鐘不成？我不禁很驚異的問他，經我這麽一問他纔源源本本的講出。</p>
<p>「當我走到中虹橋，將上橋而未上橋的時候，横裏走來了卅餘個武裝的××兵，站崗巡捕早已把木棍横起，我不能冲破了牠們道子，只得立定，那爲首的一個，帽上有圈紅邊的，大約算是隊長了吧，對我想了一想，把帽兒輕輕抬了一抬，打着很勉强的上海白道。</p>
<p>「本願寺從啊裏搭去介？」</p>
<p>我當然同他説明在武昌路，並用手勢指明，牠用手對我指了一指，意思是要我做嚮導了，那時我不得不走，只得嚮導前進，可是馬路上同胞們的一雙尊目，却没有一個不注在我身上，顯然以爲我是一個漢奸了，我雖然清白，也不由我臉上不紅，我也實認不諱，自己已做了漢奸，不過爲時祗有五分鐘罷了，所以説做了五分鐘的漢奸啊。」</p>

<p>大凡先知先覺。總要經過一番劇烈的奮鬥。和命運宣戰。然後底於成功。炳耀千秋。文明多一分進步。人類便多一分幸福。要亦食先知先覺之賜耳。</p>
<p>便宜而神速的運輸。爲現代的一種至寳。而論其筆路藍褸的開山老祖。奥斯汀勳爵就中實佔一個頭角崢嶸的地位。因其發明之小奥斯汀。髣髴汽車界之革命軍。今且風行各地。成爲必需品矣。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀在小汽車中蓋爲先輩。其本領之高。風行之廣。有非其發明者本人所能逆覩者。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀原非特造之賽跑汽車。而於一九二三年意大利錦標賽中。壓倒同儕。奪得首奬。次年。爲７５０Ｃ·Ｃ·類汽車成立十九個紀錄。又在奥法德意大陸諸邦。得奬品。著榮譽。</p>
<p>一九二六年參加澳洲六百三十二英里賽跑。雖其地情形極爲困難。而竟奏凱旋。尤爲難能而可貴。又在不力蘭造成三個紀錄。</p>
<p>翌年。在孟希里造成更多之紀錄。自三小時至五百英里。一九二八年在同地又有五個紀錄。高至二十四小時云。</p>
<p>其次年。在國内旣獻身手。在國外亦立奇功。尤以在北阿爾蘭及南菲洲爲著。</p>
<p>一九三零年爲小奥斯汀在紐絲綸及南菲洲造成新紀錄之年。而亦雙十二賽跑中亦獲勝而歸。</p>
<p>最近斯多華夫人駕駛小奥斯汀每小時行一百十英里。且造成四個國際紀錄。小奥斯汀在賽跑界之成績蓋如是。</p>
<p>在其他方面。小奥斯汀藉其製造堅固。式様精巧。足以不畏艱險。凡曾駕駛之者。莫不驚其本領之大也。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲駛登ＴａｂｌｅＭｏｕｎｔａｉｎ頂上之第一輛汽車。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲於一日内升降ＢｅｎＮｅｒｉｓ之第一輛汽車。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲由一女子駕駛環遊世界之第一輛汽車。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲單獨開駛横過歐洲而逹埃及開羅城之第一輛汽車。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲用於兩極探險。每天經受猛烈的牽拉的第一輛汽車。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲開逹昆士蘭省約克角之第一輛汽車。</p>
<p>小奥斯汀爲能以每小時一百英里以上之速度。開駛測定的英里數及基羅數之第一輛７５０Ｃ·Ｃ·汽車。</p>
<p>由上所述。可見在氣候或道路最惡劣的情形下。有時且無道路之存在。小奥斯汀竟能無遠弗届。履險如夷。</p>
<p>事實爲最雄大的辯論者。再有所説未免錦上添花矣。</p>
<h3 id="c214">英國車輛肇禍可驚　沛 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>每日死於車下者十八人</p>
<p>倫敦消息。最近據運輸部部長皮勃司及其他管理交通之政府機關職員等宣稱。不列顚境中道路肇禍案日見增多。羣情爲之惶惑。據皮勃司向下議院報告。一九三一年中英人之死於道路慘案者。計六千六百九十一人。因是而受傷者。二十萬零二千一百十九人。數目之鉅。誠足令人驚異不止也。</p>
<p>一九三一年英人爲車輛肇禍而喪生及殘廢受傷者。總數共計二十萬八千八百十人。以視布耳之戰。英軍隊兵士之死傷及染病喪亡數目、已超出四倍有奇。夫以和平之一年中而有此種鉅大之傷亡人數。殊足令人注意矣。此項統計之數目。係於國家安全會議開會時及舉行國家安全週時同時發表。國家安全會議中所討論者。咸屬於交通及實業上之各種肇禍事件。</p>
<p>交通肇禍事件之人口傷亡率。每日平匀死於全國道路上者計十八人。受傷者五百三十三人。若以一九三○年與一九三一年之統計相比較。死亡者一九三一年少六百十四人。但受傷者則增加二萬四千二百二十四人。即以倫敦一區而論。今年開首之三個月中。發生交通肇禍事件共計二萬七千九百七十七起。其中死亡者三百十四人。受傷者一萬零八百六十五人。死者之中二百二十四人係行路者。二十人係車主。四十人爲乘脚踏車者。二十四人爲駕駛機器脚踏車者。</p>
<p>英國舉行全國國家安全會議時。運輸部秘書長璧各德氏演説。略謂肇禍事件之减少。其大半可由預防方法减低之。譬如國中癘疫叢生。其喪亡之數目亦與此種車輛肇禍相仿者。則全國醫學界中人。必直起急追而爲之籌預防之方藥矣。</p>
<p>[&gt;I圖示雪鐵龍汽車裝底盤之前。</p>
<p>在嘉佛爾工塲内裝車身及墊褥之情形。</p>

<p>至於預防車輛之肇禍。則有待於較更嚴厲之處罰條例也。又須喚起羣衆之裁判。對於輕率之汽車駕駛人。予他人以生命之喪失者。應處以充分之刑罰云云。</p>
<p>關於車輛肇禍之故失問題。就大槪之情勢言之。則在城市之中。其咎屬之於行路人。在曠野之處。則駕駛者應負肇禍之責。此爲大衆所公認者也。本年關首之三個月中。英國倫敦人之死於車輛下者計二百二四十人。其中警署處以疏誤之咎者計一百六十三人。斯蓋由於鄉愚之輩往往不注意於交通之指揮有以致之。故自倫敦啓用自動交通燈號以來。汽車駕駛者自各加以注意。而行路者反有掉以輕心。任意穿街越路而過者耳。</p>
<p>曠野中之汽車肇禍案。據皇家汽車俱樂部云。其咎當屬之兩造。於前途不明之處。互相駛過。馴至肇禍。或於轉灣之頃漫不經心。以至發生慘案。又有自支路駛入大道。前途光景不明。一不留心。大禍立作。至於鬧市之間。對於漫不經心之行路人。其唯一之對付方法。惟有處以嚴厲之責罰。以資提醒耳。更有任意穿走之自由車駕駛者。尤當處以嚴罰。</p>
<p>英國一九三一年之車輛肇禍案。較之一九三○年雖屬少去六百十四起。然一九三一年乃經濟衰落之年。汽車之註冊數縮去百分之三·二。故肇禍之事亦隨之而少百分之八·五。倫敦於一九三一年間之交通肇禍案較一九三○年少七十三起。據璧各德氏之言。斯則因去年已少去死於倫敦街上之摩托自由車駕駛者及附乘於後鞍之人。氏又云摩托自由車之使用。在倫敦市中作爲運輸之具者視前已經减少。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Striving for the Law <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>I am writing for this newspaper's monthly publication and solicited an article from my friend Dr. Wu Jingxiong. Dr. Wu told me, "The *Shen Bao* was founded in 1872. This year is not only a significant one in the history of Chinese news, but also a very important year in the history of world jurisprudence. It was the year when the first edition of *The Struggle for Law* by the great German scholar Rudolf von Jhering was published." It is said that this book by Jhering has been translated into twenty-one languages with countless editions. The Japanese version was by Mutsu Munemitsu, and Liang Qichao once took its meaning to create his theory of rights, which was included in his "Collected Essays from the Ice-Drinker's Studio." The original book has a history of sixty years, coinciding with that of this newspaper. However, a Chinese translation is still lacking. I once translated half of it, but due to being busy with other things, I did not finish it, which I regret. It is not surprising that this book is not valued by the people in this stagnant academic world. However, this book is precisely suited to the current situation of our country sixty years later. It can inspire our nation's awakening and address our nation's common ailments. This is why I urgently want to discuss it."</p>
<p>Jhering's central argument is, "The purpose of law is peace, and the price of peace is struggle." Its meaning is profound. A history of legal evolution is a history of national struggle. As a result of the struggle between the aristocracy and the common people in the Western Roman era, the Law of the Twelve Tables, which protected the common people, was established. As a result of the struggle between the modern middle class and the feudal class, the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man was proclaimed. Indeed, a nation's legal protection must be obtained through great sacrifice and struggle. It cannot be achieved by foolishly standing still and hoping, like waiting for a rabbit to run into a tree. Peace cannot be achieved through complacency. It must have a considerable price. What is this price? It is struggle, constant struggle, and desperate struggle. This one principle is great beyond compare and can be applied to both domestic and foreign affairs. Our nation has been troubled by civil war for a long time. Calls for peace resound throughout the country, but the fighting continues as before. The ink from the Shanghai Truce Agreement is not yet dry, but the infighting in Guangdong has already begun. Our people's cries, even though their voices are hoarse, do not move the warlords' hearts. The people still want to seek peace without struggling or fighting for it themselves. Is this possible? Our nation has been troubled by harsh government for a long time. Everyone knows the need for constitutionalism. However, those who call for constitutionalism do not prepare for struggle or engage in basic training. They only beg the rulers to return power, like asking a tiger for its skin. Is this possible? In human history, has there ever been such a cheap constitution? Our nation has been troubled by foreign aggression for a long time. For every foot the enemy advances, we retreat ten feet. In the last hundred years, our boundless territory and national rights have been lost in this advance and retreat. Since the September 18th Incident, this advance and retreat has become even more urgent and rapid, but our national spirit has not been shaken by this. We only follow the non-resistance government and pray for the League of Nations to help us recover our territory. Is this possible? In the world's national salvation movements, has there ever been such a despicable movement?</p>
<p>Alas, Jhering's book is truly a head-on blow to our people. Firstly, "The law is given to the people, not to those who do not work for it. The people must bravely advance, shed blood, and struggle to obtain it." Secondly, "In its historical progress, the law presents to our eyes a picture of fierce attack, struggle, hardship, and relentless effort to find a way out." Thirdly, "A nation whose rights are invaded and remains silent is, in effect, declaring its own death sentence. If this nation allows others to plunder one square mile of its land without seeking redress, then people will take an inch and advance a foot until all the land is taken and the country perishes. Such a nation is not worthy of a good destiny."</p>
<p>The lesson that Jhering has given us is, in short, that only a nation that rises up to struggle can eliminate civil war. Only a nation that rises up to struggle can enjoy constitutionalism. Only a nation that rises up to struggle can protect its territory. A people who do not know how to struggle are not worthy of being the people of a country ruled by law. A nation that does not know how to struggle is not worthy of being an independent nation. From the September 18th Incident to the present, it has been nine months. In these nine months, let the people try to look back and ask themselves what hardships they have experienced, how they have struggled to fight against fate, and what ways they will take to survive and seek salvation in the future. Can one read Jhering's book without sweating profusely and being startled awake?</p>

<p>Condemning it as a Violation of the Spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>The British Government is also Closely Monitoring</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a note from the Japanese Ambassador to the United States forwarded by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, stating the customs issue in the Northeast. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers this issue complex, and the response has not yet been determined. The U.S. note stated that, according to reports, "Manchukuo" is preparing for customs autonomy and is organizing an independent customs administration, with a Japanese person as the chief of customs. If this plan is established, it will undermine the integrity of Chinese customs and violate the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. The U.S. government has been closely monitoring the implementation of the treaty. The Nine-Power Treaty guarantees the territorial and administrative integrity of China. The signatory countries are the United States, Belgium, Britain, China, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) In the House of Commons today, Conservative Samuel asked the Foreign Office whether it had received news that the Japanese government intended to use the customs revenue of the three eastern provinces to repay the portion of British debt that was secured by customs revenue, handing it over to those previously responsible for collecting taxes and repaying debts. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that, according to recent news, customs revenue collected from three of the six customs houses in the three eastern provinces was still being remitted to Shanghai as usual. The surplus customs revenue from the other three houses was deposited into a special county account. The British government is paying close attention to the issue of foreign debt secured by Chinese customs revenue, but there is no credible reason to believe that this guarantee has been broken. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(New York) It is now confirmed by the State Department that Secretary of State Stimson informally expressed U.S. concern about the annexation of the Chinese customs houses in the three eastern provinces to Japan on June 10. This news is carried in a Washington dispatch in today's *New York Times*, stating that the United States had to lodge a protest because the Boxer Indemnity owed to it was secured by Chinese customs revenue. Japan replied that this was a matter for the government of "Manchukuo" and had nothing to do with Japan. It also said that it was not surprising that Britain had also lodged a similar protest, as Britain had a large amount of loans also secured by Chinese customs revenue. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources today, the Japanese government has decided to make every effort to mediate and peacefully resolve the Dalian customs issue. Japan intends to convene a conference of the powers and the Chinese ambassador to resolve the issue, proposing to allocate sufficient funds from the collected customs revenue to repay foreign debt, with the remaining revenue to be divided between the Chinese customs and "Manchukuo".

<p>(Nanjing) In the afternoon of the 21st, Li Dazhang, the representative of the National Salvation Association, returned to Nanjing from the Northeast and reported to the press on the current situation in the Northeast as follows: 1. The righteous and brave army can be roughly divided into four districts: A. North Manchuria (Jilin and Heilongjiang). The leaders Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Ding Chao, Li Haiqing, etc., were all formed by formal troops in the past. The recent battles in the suburbs of Harbin were participated in by this unit. B. The righteous army along the Yalu River is composed of police, Baojia, and small groups of bandits scattered in various places, and has no real strength. C. The righteous army in central Liaoning is the Lao Bei Feng unit. D. The righteous army along the Beining Railway is scattered and has no organization. In short, the lack of supply and unified command is the biggest shortcoming of the righteous army. 2. Most of the financial institutions in Manchuria are controlled by the Japanese. Recently, agricultural products in the Northeast cannot be exported, and the economy is cut off. The puppet state of Manchuria borrows 20 million Japanese gold yen from Japan with the mining mountains as collateral, which is not enough to raise money from the people again. The people in the Northeast are heavily extorted and have no ability to live. 3. The politics of the puppet state of Manchuria takes the Republican Association as the only political party in Manchuria. Each province and county follows the Kuomintang's method of establishing a guiding committee. All political measures in the provinces and counties must be approved by the Guiding Committee. The chairman of the General Assembly is Zhao Xinbo, and the rest are half Chinese and half Japanese. The necessity of the establishment of Manchukuo is propagated everywhere. A Japan-Manchukuo Cooperation Association is also organized to supervise and investigate local politics, with half Chinese and half Japanese. A Clearance Bureau is also set up, which is hosted by the Japanese, to clear up the bandits (including the volunteer army) in various places. Railways and transportation businesses are completely in the hands of the Japanese, and minerals are also being mined, which is beautifully named to open up financial resources for Manchukuo, but in reality, the Japanese are extracting them themselves. 4. Education. All schools above secondary level are suspended, and elementary schools continue to open, adding Manchurian history and Japanese language. A Manchuria-Japan Friendship Association is set up where each school is located. 5. The army of the puppet state of Manchuria is about 50,000 people, and the organization is based on brigades. The officers are Chinese, and the staff are Japanese, specializing in suppressing bandits, and are controlled by the commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo. 6. The situation of the people in the Northeast. Because they are subject to the requisition of the righteous army and the extortion of the puppet government, the people are struggling to survive. They hate Zhang Xueliang the most, because his formal army did not resist, but entrusted the responsibility of recovering lost land to the volunteer army. As a result, all those who lost their lives and property were Chinese, and the Japanese did not suffer much loss. I hope that the government will govern them in a unified manner with the organizational principles of the regular army, so that it can be consistent. Otherwise, the people will welcome the formal army out of the customs. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Commission, discussed the operational situation of the Jiaoji Railway. Since the incidents in the Northeast and Shanghai, business has plummeted. Coal is the main commodity transported by the railway. Factories in Zhabei were completely destroyed. However, foreign-operated ships and factories all use Kailuo coal, which has greatly impacted transportation. Although there were many imports of Japanese goods in the past, sales have also decreased recently. Exports such as peanuts are also less this year. Business is declining to its lowest point, but it is still not running at a loss. There are now plans to issue bonds to redeem the railway. It was found that 40 million Japanese yen were borrowed from the Japanese government in 1922, with an annual interest rate of 6%. 2.4 million yuan was repaid every year in two seasons, and it was paid off in five years. July 1st of last year was the due date for repayment. At that time, the Japanese yen was soaring, and one hundred yuan of our currency could only buy 43 Japanese yen. To avoid losses, negotiations were held with the Japanese side, which agreed to repay 700,000 first. However, this 700,000 was also used to deposit 1.2 million of our currency in the bank to generate interest. The Yokohama Specie Bank allocated the funds for payment. The remaining 500,000 yuan was only allocated this spring in March when the Japanese yen fell to over 70 yuan per hundred. This move saved the railway more than 400,000 yuan. The railway's assets are currently worth over 60 million, and in five years it could be over 70 million. Therefore, the current issuance of 60 million in railway redemption bonds will use the railway's assets as collateral. In five years, when the Japanese yen can fall to be the same as our currency, only 40 million will be needed. The sales prospects for the bonds should be optimistic. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zou Zuohua arrived in Nanjing and talked about his overseas inspection experience. He was ordered to go abroad to inspect agricultural reclamation. Germany uses science to increase agricultural production. In the past, only one season of rice and millet was harvested each year, but now they can use scientific methods to increase the harvest to three seasons each year. The millet produced is also more fertile and thicker than natural quality. Other countries are also doing the same. Looking back at our country, which is based on agriculture, agricultural food is instead supplied by imported goods, which is regrettable. In terms of military equipment, the naval, land, and air force education equipment of various countries are superior to ours, and our years of internal strife have exhausted our vitality. If this continues for ten years, we may be eliminated by various countries. We should wake up quickly. The lost territory in the Northeast must be recovered by force. Relying on negotiations is unreliable. The resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia should be realized as soon as possible so that we can have a partner in diplomacy.

<p>Following the Example of the Deceased Korean Strategist, Will Establish the So-Called "Manchurian Governor-General"</p>
<p>The Pseudo-State Sends a Girl Envoy to Japan to Request Recognition</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Japan's plan to unify the four-headed political system of Manchuria and Mongolia was decided upon at a five-province vice-ministerial meeting today. It is said that its name has been determined as the Japan Special Envoy Governor-General's Office in Manchuria, which is in the same vein as the demise of Korea. Before Japan annexed Korea, it first appointed Ito Hirobumi as the Korean Governor-General.</p>
<p>Telegraph Communication Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Regarding the unification of the four-headed political system in Manchuria, the Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Army, Finance, and Colonial Affairs held a meeting today. From a financial point of view, opinions on whether unification could be implemented were not consistent. As a result, the administration of the South Manchuria Railway affiliated lands will temporarily have to be entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway as before. This opinion is more powerful, and it was decided to conduct further research and investigation.</p>
<p>Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: In order to request Japan's recognition of the pseudo-state, the Association of Concordia specially dispatched a girl envoy, Yu Jingyuan, and 13 others (8 Manchurians and 6 Japanese) to Japan. The envoy arrived in Tokyo at 8:30 this morning.</p>
<p>Telegraph Communication Agency, Changchun, 21st: Ding Jianxiu, the Minister of Transportation of the pseudo-state, recently announced that he would depart from Changchun for Japan on the 28th as an informal national representative. The purpose of his visit to Japan is to discuss the issue of Japan's recognition of Manchuria, the issue of cooperation between Japanese and Manchurians, and the issue of promoting industrial development in Manchuria with influential figures in Japan and urge their implementation.</p>
<p>Telegraph Communication Agency, Tokyo, 20th: The Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tani, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for Manchuria on the 24th. Regarding the purpose of his visit to Manchuria, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it has no political implications. However, at this time when the issue of recognizing the pseudo-state and the issue of seizing Dalian customs duties have recently become major issues, it seems to be related to this. In addition, the Director of the Information Department, Shiratori Toshio, will inspect the political and military situation in Manchuria after Tani returns to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Lausanne Reparations Conference Reaches Impasse <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>France's Attitude Hardens, Unwilling to Easily Give Up Reparations</p>
<p>Divergent Opinions Between Britain and France, No Hope of Resolution Within Ten Days</p>
<p>The Conference is Extended to Continue Private Talks</p>
<p>Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg Invite Other Countries to Join Economic Alliance</p>
<p>National Society, Lausanne, 20th: Tonight's reparations conference has clearly reached an impasse. British Prime Minister MacDonald's plan for a complete write-off has expressed strong opposition since Herriot returned to France to discuss it. The French clearly want Germany to continue paying reparations to the best of its ability. Therefore, the positions of both sides are very divergent. After today's meeting of the six major countries, a communiqué was issued stating that the chairman reported that the representatives of each country had begun to discuss the major issues of the conference and were continuing to discuss them.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 20th: The divergence of opinions between Britain and France regarding the issue of war debts and reparations is now fully evident. French Prime Minister Herriot's remarks to French reporters today were quite important. He said that writing off war debts is quite appealing in the abstract, but if implemented, France will sacrifice 365,000,000 marks in reparations and an annual interest rate of 5.5% every year for 37 years, while Britain will only give up 60,000,000 marks each year. Although Herriot's statement is not entirely accurate, it is sufficient to indicate the distance between British and French opinions. Therefore, the outside world is not surprised that the progress of the meeting is not as rapid as expected. After British Prime Minister MacDonald and Herriot held a private meeting for three hours today, it was generally believed that there was absolutely no hope of resolution within ten days. French Prime Minister Herriot seemed to be influenced by the right wing in the country after returning to Paris at the end of last week, so his current attitude is tougher than before. According to the current situation, France seems unwilling to easily give up the final reparations and is focusing on obtaining German railway bonds. Today's meeting of the representatives of the six initiator countries was nothing more than a discussion of routine matters. The meeting time was very short, and tomorrow's general meeting has been decided to cancel so that all parties can continue to hold private talks. This afternoon, German Prime Minister Papen and Foreign Minister Neurath went to MacDonald's tea party and talked for about two hours. MacDonald likely inquired about the German side's opinions on the points raised by Herriot this morning. In the next few days, all parties will devote themselves to eliminating differences in order to obtain a common ground, and then discuss practical plans. Since the meeting is indefinite, this method is easier to take effect than pre-preparing a plan.</p>
<p>Havas, Brussels, 20th: Representatives from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg signed a treaty near Lausanne to gradually reduce tariffs with each other. An announcement was issued here this afternoon stating that the treaty is based on the principles repeatedly stipulated by the League of Nations, and any country can join. The contracting parties believe that this matter will help the recovery of the general economic situation. In their mutual relations, they will no longer create new taxes and will gradually reduce the current tax rates by 10% each year to a certain standard. This standard will be gradually stipulated. Each contracting party will no longer adopt any new measures to restrict import trade or restrict export trade, except in the special circumstances stipulated between each other. Any third country can join this agreement and be on an equal footing with the contracting parties.</p>
<h3 id="e82">France's Reparations Solution Plan <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 21st: Kranz, the editor-in-chief of the German newspaper Die Welt, has reportedly had close contact with German, British, and French representatives in Lausanne. This morning, the newspaper published details of the reparations solution plan proposed by France. It is said that France is prepared to cancel unconditional reparations and reduce conditional reparations to what it calls the pure reparations point, which is equal to the amount by which the unconditional reparations annuity exceeds France's war debt payments. It is said that Herriot insists that even if the United States agrees to cancel reparations, this payment should still be paid, and the amount is temporarily set at 360 million marks. Kranz believes that the total amount of reparations that Germany should pay to Romania and Yugoslavia, including the principal and interest of the Young Plan and Dawes Plan debts, and the amounts specially agreed upon with the United States and Belgium, is 600 million marks per year. Based on the gold price calculated by the Young Plan, it is close to 800 million marks. He also said that Herriot is undoubtedly prepared to bargain, but the amount required by France is too far from the amount that Germany can pay, and it seems that it is difficult to reach an agreement. Finally, Kranz also said that Herriot feels compelled by the domestic situation and must insist that Germany must pay a certain amount, even if it is very small, because he fears that if he returns to Paris empty-handed, he will be in danger of being overthrown.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Disarmament Negotiations Revived <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The United States Strongly Advocates Reducing Military Strength</p>
<p>Recognizes that War Debts and Disarmament are Inseparable</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 20th: Regarding the sudden revival of disarmament negotiations, it is widely rumored here today that British Prime Minister MacDonald wants to obtain the US government's consent to its plan to stop the arms race for ten years, and once the term expires, to abolish all aggressive weapons stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. However, France is said to strongly oppose this plan. This proposal advocates reducing the budgets of the army and navy, but the concept of organizing an international army has been effectively abandoned. As for the United States, it is said that it does not quite agree with the British Prime Minister's proposal, believing that the reduction of military equipment should be started immediately in accordance with the practical ratio agreed upon by the countries according to their special circumstances.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 21st: Last night, Herriot and Gibson held a secret meeting in a small country inn in Morges, a town not far from Lausanne. The figures from all parties at the Lausanne Conference were suspicious of it all day long. Now, the doubts have been dispelled, and the public is very relieved, because the French and American representatives were discussing the issue of disarmament. Although the debt issue was also raised, Gibson made a very important statement, explaining to Herriot the reason why the United States strongly advocates reducing military strength and quantitative disarmament plans. Herriot also clarified France's attitude on this matter, saying that safety is France's top priority, so any reduction in strength must be given very serious consideration. Gibson then said that if Europe cancels war debts on the one hand and uses the funds that are sufficient to pay off all debts and have a surplus for military equipment, how will it justify itself? It is said that on Sunday night last week, Gibson had a two-hour meeting with British Prime Minister MacDonald at his residence in Morges. The United States' linking of the disarmament issue with the war debt issue has now been officially recognized. If Europe is willing to implement disarmament, the United States is prepared to consider financial sacrifices. It is said that this sentiment of the United States on war debts and disarmament is the result of a transatlantic telephone conversation between President Hoover and Gibson yesterday. The United States' plan to reduce strength, which was identified by Herriot as unacceptable, stipulates a precise calculation based on area, population, borders, colonial missions, and transportation lines, and must be reduced by at least 10%. It is said that Herriot said that the French government is unable to agree to this kind of strength-stripping measure, which the French people will never tolerate.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 21st: The American representatives to the Disarmament Conference, Gibson and Davis, have now arrived here from Geneva. It is generally believed that this trip is very relevant, especially because of Gibson's sudden arrival after his secret conversation with Herriot.</p>

<p>The New World Gradually Moving Away from Europe</p>
<p>Same Phenomenon Occurring Between Japan and the Asian Continent</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 20th - Based on longitude studies, Mr. Aesclagnion discovered a strange phenomenon and presented a report at the French National Academy of Sciences for the members of the Academy to study. Mr. Aesclagnion discovered that the American continent is gradually moving away from Europe, with the distance between the two continents gradually increasing. The rate of increase has recently reached only a few millimeters per year. However, other phenomena are also occurring simultaneously. The American continent makes periodic lateral movements on the ground. Every eleven years, it returns to the beginning. For about the first five years, it moves away from Europe, and in the subsequent five years, it gradually approaches. The distance between the furthest and closest positions exceeds fifteen millimeters. However, the trend of moving away is ultimately stronger than the trend of approaching. This is why the distance between the two continents of Europe and America increases year by year. (From 1920 to 1925, the two continents moved away from each other, while from 1925 to 1930, they moved closer again.) Some say that the American government's isolationist policy can be explained by the above phenomenon, which is said to be a jest. Furthermore, in Asia, the same phenomenon is said to be occurring between Japan and the Asian continent.</p>

Mr. Borah is one of the strongest advocates of prohibition in the United States. Mr. Borah stated that the current Republican platform is designed to adapt to the political environment. Therefore, it does not maintain the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution regarding prohibition, but instead tends to abandon it. The Republican Party held a national convention in Chicago this time to decide on the preparations for the upcoming presidential election, but Borah refused to attend. The only reason is that Mr. Borah failed to obtain assistance from the White House regarding the prohibition issue. Now that Mr. Borah's declaration in Congress is such, it can be seen that there is a significant disagreement between Mr. Borah and President Hoover regarding the prohibition issue, which is extremely noteworthy. Furthermore, today, Democratic Senator Lewis asked Mr. Borah in Congress whether he would support Mr. Hoover in the upcoming presidential election. Mr. Borah answered without hesitation, "I will not." Therefore, the Democratic Party believes that the Republican Party has already experienced a split regarding the prohibition issue.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 20th - Officials from the US Public Health Service claim that the bureau has completely invented a serum that can absolutely prevent bubonic plague. The manufacturing method involves crushing plague-infected fleas and mixing them into a liquid, which is then injected into guinea pigs. After they develop mild symptoms, their extract is used to produce a serum that can protect humans from the plague. This plague is one of the most terrible epidemics in the world. Doctors from various countries have studied it for many years without finding an effective preventive medicine. This invention is very important for public health.</p>

<p>Japanese Business Already Extinct</p>
<p>Ship Staff Also to Return Home</p>
<p>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, Tsuruga - According to Hirose Eitaro, who was recently forced to return from Vladivostok by the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities are implementing a new policy of oppressing the Japanese, namely refusing Japanese-Russian currency exchange. Anyone with even a slight suspicion is detained at the Vladivostok Detective Bureau or exiled abroad. The individual businesses of Japanese residents there have long been extinct, and the Osaka Shosen Merchant Shipping Group's agency, including all staff from Manager Goto down, and the employees of the Kobe International Shipping Branch, are also unable to stay any longer and have decided to return home together within a few days. Furthermore, the route between Tsuruga and Vladivostok has been seized by the Soviet commercial fleet. This active plan to oppress the Japanese has not slackened in the slightest to this day.</p>

<p>Ma Zhanshan Vows to Resist Japan and Punish Traitors to the End</p>
<p>Steel, the Manchuria correspondent for the New York Times of the United States, and Linde, a Swiss journalist (the Japanese report refers to a German journalist), were insulted by Northeast traitors after returning to Harbin after meeting with Ma Zhanshan. According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, after Steel and Linde met with Ma Zhanshan, they attracted attention from all sides. When Steel and Linde returned to Harbin, they stayed at a certain hotel, created reports, and telegraphed them to their home countries. It is not yet clear whether they provided the investigation team of the League of Nations with various materials. The following is a record of the talks they gave to visiting reporters: We talked with Ma Zhanshan for three days. Ma has concentrated 20,000 troops and is determined to overthrow Manchuria. Ma's residence is uncertain, and the uniforms of his troops are extremely neat. Ma has not yet contacted Ding Chao and Li Du, but Ma's will is very firm. In the future, no matter what sacrifices are made, even if only one soldier is left, he will resist Japan and punish traitors to the end. Steel and Linde also said that the purpose of meeting Ma this time was to go as news reporters and they had not been commissioned by the League of Nations' investigation team.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Current Status of the Beining Railway <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>More Than 6 Million Yuan in Railway Funds Confiscated by the Japanese</p>
<p>Current Monthly Loss of About 2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, the losses of the Beining Railway since the September 18th Incident have been enormous, and business has plummeted. According to Xu Wenguo, the deputy director of the railway bureau, the losses of the entire railway and the current situation are roughly as follows: Since September 18th, the railway has had more than 6 million yuan in savings in Shenyang confiscated by the Japanese. More than 1 million yuan of this fund was allocated for the construction of the Huludao port, and the rest was reserved for repaying the railway's British loan. The British loan borne by the railway is repaid annually, with principal and interest paid off by the 40th year of the Republic, at approximately 2 million yuan per year. The Japanese confiscated more than 5 million yuan, which is approximately enough for two years of principal and interest. After the creditors negotiated with Japan, Japan agreed to repay the principal and interest on their behalf in accordance with the contract. The method of repaying the debt will be determined based on the overall situation of the railway after the confiscated funds have been paid off. As for Huludao, the railway has not provided monthly assistance for port construction since the September 18th Incident. The Dutch port management company has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese to recover the confiscated million yuan, but the Japanese have not allowed it because they do not want the port to be completed. It is rumored that the port construction project has been suspended. Our bureau has not received a report, so it is difficult to determine. Since the Northeast Army retreated into the pass, the Japanese army has intercepted no less than a thousand passenger and freight locomotives from the railway and the Jinzhao, Yinggou, Datong, and Liandao branch lines. The loss of materials from various stations has also been enormous. In the past, the railway's monthly passenger and freight revenue was approximately 3.56 million yuan. Since Japan supported the pseudo-Fengshan Railway, the railway's section outside the pass has been unable to operate. The monthly income has decreased by more than 2 million yuan. Although passengers and cargo inside and outside the pass are now transferred by changing trains and tickets at Shanhaiguan, the Japanese army is rampant and unbridled outside the pass, causing the majority of farmers to lose their jobs and business to be deserted. All cargo has also been rerouted to Dalian. As for merchants and travelers, they are even more scarce. Therefore, although the railway inside the pass is operating normally, the business is very sluggish. Fortunately, joint transportation and cooperation has been implemented with the Pinghan, Jinpu, Pingsui, Jiaoji, and Longhai railways. (Note: Cooperation means that the Beining Railway lends cars to other railways to transport passengers and cargo, with the income split in a 3-7 ratio.) The income has increased slightly, but only amounts to more than 1 million yuan per month, which is only enough to cover the salaries of the 30,000+ employees inside the pass. Currently, many of the old employees from the stations outside the pass are serving for the pseudo-Fengshan Railway. They are subjected to oppression and humiliation by the Japanese and feel extremely pained. They have repeatedly wanted to enter the pass, but the business inside the pass is not prosperous, and there is no ability to resettle them. Last month, the Ministry of Railways issued 100,000 yuan as a reward to employees who contributed to the Shen-Jin Incident. Employees who did not contribute cannot receive the award. However, the East Station Trade Union demanded universal treatment. This actually violated the original intention of the Ministry of Railways' award. After repeated guidance and explanation of the advantages and disadvantages, and agreeing to issue an additional 5-6,000 yuan to establish a cooperative to seek permanent benefits for the workers, a storm was calmed. Otherwise, a workers' strike would break out, creating an opportunity for fishermen. (June 19)</p>

<p>The Ninth Division Stationed Between Xuzhou and Bengbu</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence, since the 7th and 12th Divisions of the Jinpu Line garrison were dispatched from Xuzhou and Bengbu to northern Anhui to suppress bandits, the 49th Divisions of the Second Army have successively been ordered to assemble on the Jinpu Line. The 4th Division of Xu Tingyao has already participated in the bandit suppression in northern Anhui from Bengbu. The 9th Division of Li Yannian has just arrived in the Bengbu Mentai area from Zhejiang Province. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the Second Army, has ordered the transfer of the military headquarters to Xuzhou, as his troops have assembled on the Jinpu Line. The 9th Division of Li Yannian has also been ordered to be transferred to Xuzhou. Today (20th), a group of staff officers from the Second Army headquarters have arrived in Xuzhou and designated the Zhejiang Guild Hall as the military headquarters address. The 9th Division has also sent staff officer He Yinghua to Xuzhou to find a garrison location. The vanguard cavalry company and supply battalion have already arrived in Xuzhou on two trains this morning and afternoon. The remaining troops will be sent on. The reporter recently visited He Yinghua. According to his statement, the division was transferred to the Jinpu Line after suppressing the communists in Jiangxi and after reorganization in Zhejiang. It is a transfer of defense and there is no appointment of any kind. Commander Jiang Dingwen is currently in Shanghai, and Division Commander Li Yannian is currently in Bengbu. Both should be able to arrive in Xuzhou in a few days. As for the 9th Division's troops, the 26th Brigade of Zheng Zuomin will come to Xuzhou from Mentai, and the 25th Brigade of Li Xiangrong will be temporarily stationed in Bengbu. This division will be stationed along the way between Xuzhou and Bengbu. The Independent Brigade of Zhou Kaixun is still in Shanghai and has not received an order to depart. The division headquarters does not have a suitable location for the time being and plans to temporarily set it up in the No. 1 Hospital of Xuzhou during the summer vacation. As for the future mission, it will also be to participate in bandit suppression. (June 20)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Peng Dehuai Flees to Ninggang <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Peng's Band Repeatedly Defeated in Ru, Gui, Chaling, and Ling Counties</p>
<p>After Fleeing to Ninggang, He Hopes to Join Kong Helong</p>
<p>Hunan Army Has Divided into Three Routes to Encircle and Suppress Ninggang</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, Peng Dehuai, after fleeing from Ruicheng and Guidong Counties in southern Hunan last month to the border of Jiangxi, was chased by the 15th Division of the Hunan Army, led by Wang Dongyuan, to Jilong and Shangbu in Jiangxi Province, where he was severely punished, with an estimated 500+ bandits killed and twice as many wounded. Wang's division also suffered more than 400 casualties. Therefore, Peng's bandits dared not disturb southern Hunan again and fled north to Ninggang in Jiangxi and Chaling and Ling Counties in Hunan, attempting to join Kong Helong's band in Pingliu and the Hunan-Jiangxi border of Tongwan. Therefore, the Chaling area in eastern Hunan became tense. Starting from the 10th, Peng personally led 10,000 people to attack Chaling County, and separately dispatched Yuan Guoping's entire pseudo-5th Army of 5,000+ people to attack Ling County. Upon receiving the report, Liu Jianxu, commander of the 28th Army of the Hunan Army, immediately ordered Chen Guangzhong, commander of the 63rd Division, to lead his troops back to Ling County from Guidong to provide reinforcements. Wang Dongyuan's brigade of the 15th Division followed Peng's bandits from Shangbu, Jiangxi, to Chaling, Hunan. Tao Guang, commander of the 61st Division, led his troops from You County to Chaling to suppress the bandits. Wang Zhichang, commander of the security team, led his troops from Anren to Chaling to intercept, and also supported Ling County. The above units were all required to arrive at their destinations within a specified period to block and suppress the bandits from different routes. Peng's bandits were unable to succeed again. Although Chaling County was once surrounded, the bandits retreated after only a few hours. In recent days, Chen Guangzhong, Wang Dongyuan, Tao Guang, and other units have had some contact with the bandits in Yantang, Kangkou, and Nankeng in Chaling County and the Miandu and Hukou areas in Ling County, but there have been no fierce battles. It is reported that Peng's bandits have led the crowd back to their old nest in Ninggang, Jiangxi. Therefore, Liu Jianxu decided to supervise the pursuit, and his mobilization order is as follows: (1) Wang Dongyuan's division advances from Guidong; (2) Chen Guangzhong's division advances from Ling County; (3) Tao Guang's division advances from Chaling and Pingxiang, all with Ninggang as the destination. Liu Jianxu moved from Yongxing to You County on the 17th to command the various units and telegraphed He Yingqin to quickly order the Jiangxi troops to cooperate in blocking and intercepting the bandits. It was recently learned that Wang Dongyuan had arrived in Guidong on the 18th and Liu Jianxu had arrived in You County on the 19th. The date of the joint meeting at Ninggang is estimated to be after the 20th. (June 19)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Songjiang China Industrial Bank Robbed in Broad Daylight <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>More Than 13,000 Yuan in Cash and Silver Were Robbed</p>
<p>The Robbers All Escaped and Are Being Pursued</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank branch, formerly the site of the Songjiang Bank, just opened on the 10th of this month. Unexpectedly, at 11:20 AM yesterday (20th), four robbers suddenly arrived. One was wearing a gray silk long gown and carrying a rattan suitcase. The other three were wearing short clothes and spoke with a Shanghai accent. One robber was standing guard outside the counter, holding a four-inch pistol. Three robbers jumped into the counter. The robber holding the pistol warned the bank staff not to make any noise. They first dismantled the telephone and then found the warehouse manager, Jiang Zhuanxun, and forced him to hand over the warehouse key. Jiang, seeing that he could not refuse, was forced to open the warehouse. In addition to not taking the silver dollars in the warehouse, they put 10,000 yuan in cash and 450 yuan in fractional notes into the rattan suitcase and returned to the business hall. They robbed more than 3,000 yuan from the safe. During the robbery, Mr. Zhu, a public relations officer of the bank, entered from the back door and was also slapped. The robbers were calm and unhurried. When they finished robbing, it was 11:45 AM. They left with the loot. The bank staff, after regaining their composure, went outside to report to the police on duty and reported to the jurisdictional sub-station. By then, the robbers had already disappeared. When asked, the neighboring shops had not noticed this. Therefore, no one knew where the robbers escaped. After the case occurred, military and police authorities rushed to the scene to investigate. The total amount robbed was calculated to be 13,367 yuan. Police detectives and scouts were sent out in all directions, guarding stations and wharves, hoping to arrest the robbers and recover the stolen goods. It is said that after the county government was informed, it was shocked that there was such a major bank robbery in broad daylight in a busy area within the police district. It ordered the Director of Public Security to solve the case within three days and punish the responsible patrol officer by recording a major demerit to demonstrate punishment. The bank has reported everything to the Shanghai headquarters.</p>

<p>Vigorous Campaign to Eliminate the Three Evils - Although the suppression of opium, gambling, and prostitution in Suzhou City is nominally being carried out, it is not actually the case. There are more than 150 opium dens, 5-6 gambling dens, and more than 400 private prostitutes of first, second, and third class inside and outside the city. Yesterday, the county party headquarters convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and mass organizations.

<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Sell Rice as Military Grain - The Yingyuan Rice Store in Nanjing has sent people to Wuxi several times in recent days to purchase large quantities of rice for sale in Nanjing, in an attempt to make a profit. However, because the procedures for transportation are very troublesome and there is a great lack of vehicles, it cannot be shipped on schedule. The unscrupulous merchants came up with the strange idea of using stationery and envelopes from the National Government with the words "Training Corps" written on them as certificates for purchasing military rice. However, since there was no seal and it did not resemble a passport, it inevitably aroused suspicion. Yesterday, the rice store sent someone named Zhang to Wuxi again, purchased more than a hundred dan of white rice from a certain rice store at the Coal Mine Port, and handed it over to the railway station to load it onto two covered cars of 40 tons and 25 tons. When the above-mentioned documents were presented, it was revealed and the rice was detained and stored in the warehouse for thorough investigation.</p>

The water level has reached the height of the levees. Tens of thousands of mu of sandy fields with soybeans and cotton were flooded, resulting in total loss beyond calculation. The most tragic situation is that the houses of thousands of sand-dwelling people only have rooftops visible. The situation was most severe from 8 PM to 11 PM on the 19th, as heavy rain poured down in the dark night and the river tide roared furiously. Many sand-dwelling people were unable to escape, leading to the destruction of entire families. About three to four tenths were washed away by the tide.

<h3 id="e105">A Message to Those Advocating for Diplomatic Relations with Russia - Chen Qitian <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Also Questioning Reporter Chen Binhe of Shen Bao (Continued)</p>
<p>Secondly, although resuming diplomatic relations is not equal to accommodating the communists, it greatly helps the communists. This is also closely related, and it is an important fact that those of us who discuss the issue of resuming diplomatic relations must pay special attention to. To understand this fact, it is necessary to explain it from three aspects. Firstly, we must understand Russia's foreign policy towards the Far East, especially Russia's foreign policy towards China. Mr. Chen said, "The Soviet Union has retreated from an aggressive foreign policy to a defensive foreign policy, such as signing unequal treaties with Turkey, Germany, Afghanistan, Rislania, Persia, Lithuania, Finland, and France."</p>
<p>This statement is half right and half wrong. What is right is that in recent years, Soviet Russia has indeed shifted from an offensive foreign policy towards Europe, America, and Japan to a defensive foreign policy. Because it had previously launched offensives, suffered repeated failures, and aroused resentment, it had to retreat. Currently, the organ of the Russian party has stated that it is willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with Japan, which is invading China, and has also stated that when necessary, it will not hesitate to find a country in the capitalist world to contain Japan. These are all indications of defensive diplomacy.</p>
<p>However, Russia's foreign policy towards the Far East, especially towards China, is by no means defensive but still offensive. Or, to be more precise, we can use tactical terms to describe the current Russian foreign policy towards China as a defensive offensive strategy or an offensive defensive strategy.</p>
<p>Since the Communist Party came to power in Russia, it has established two so-called world revolution strategies, namely Russia's foreign strategy. The first strategy is to attack capitalist countries, unite the proletariat, and dismantle the powerful countries from within. The second strategy is to attack Asian countries (excluding Japan), unite small and weak nations, and create chaos for the powerful countries from the outside. The first strategy has failed successively in the results of trials in various countries, such as the so-called social revolutions launched by Russia, Germany, Austria, and Italy, which have completely failed. Britain once severed diplomatic relations with Russia for propagating communism in England. The United States has not yet resumed diplomatic relations with Russia to prevent the spread of communism. Russia felt that this strategy would further isolate it in international relations, so it implemented a compromise with capitalist countries, shifting from offense to defense to avoid fundamental shaking. However, Russia's ambition for a red empire has not been abandoned. It has adopted a strategy of avoiding the real and taking advantage of the void, shifting its attack target to China in an attempt to turn the entire China red. The target of attack of this foreign strategy丨丨China is indeed the fundamental spirit of Soviet Russia's foreign policy. China is a semi-colony of imperialism and is naturally hated by the general public. Therefore, Soviet Russia ordered the Communist Party to shout the slogan of overthrowing imperialism to incite the masses. Soviet Russia also said that imperialism is the common enemy of China and Russia, which is tantamount to saying that China's anti-imperialist movement is not only for China but also for Russia. To put it more clearly, the anti-imperialist movement directed by Soviet Russia in China is based on Soviet Russia's foreign strategy of frontal defense and flank attack against capitalist countries. Soviet Russia frontally defends the great powers, allowing itself to recuperate, and flanks and attacks China. Although the direct victim is China, the indirect victim is also the great powers. Isn't this a new and clever plan that allows Soviet Russia to consolidate its country and attack the great powers? For Russia, this is the best plan. For China, it cannot avoid being sacrificed by Russia's defensive offensive foreign strategy. China is the first line of defense of Russia's foreign strategy and is a defensive offensive front. In any case, Russia wants to thoroughly redden China unless China does not provide it with the convenience of thoroughly reddening China. If China immediately resumes diplomatic relations with Russia, it will be providing Russia with the convenience of thoroughly reddening China and fully realizing its defensive foreign strategy. What kind of "new diplomatic policy" is that for China? That's why I say that immediately resuming diplomatic relations is not clearly accommodating the communists but in fact greatly helps the communists.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must understand the close relationship between Russia and the Communist Party. In Soviet Russia, which is known as communist (actually state capitalism), the Communist Party is in power, and Russia and the Communist Party have extremely close relations. It is not necessary to say that the Communist Party in China also has extremely close relations with Russia. This is also a fact that we cannot deny. Although the Communist Party has added the two words "China" as a guise, it is actually Russian, not Chinese. This can be proven from the source, organizational system, and command and control of the so-called Chinese Communist Party. The Communist Party was created by Russia sending people with money to China to organize it. Without Russia, there would be no Communist Party like the present one. Even if there were a Communist Party, it would never become a tool used by Russia. This is the source of the Communist Party. The Communist Party claims to belong to the Third International, but the Third International is actually a large tool of Russia. Whatever Russia wants, the Third International wants. Whatever the Third International wants, the so-called Chinese Communist Party wants. Chen Duxiu was overthrown for disobeying, and Li Lisan was overthrown for disobeying. Chen and Li were both leaders of the Communist Party, but they had to be overthrown at Russia's command. This shows that Russia occupies the highest position of power in the organization and command and control of the Communist Party. If Russia and the Communist Party are forcibly separated into two completely unrelated things, it is either due to a lack of common sense or because of Russian propaganda. Since Russia and the Communist Party are two extremely closely related things, then immediately resuming diplomatic relations cannot avoid strengthening the Communist Party. The Communist Party is rampant right now, so can we immediately resume diplomatic relations with Russia to strengthen the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must understand that once diplomatic relations with Russia are resumed, we must recognize the establishment of embassies in Moscow and China, as well as consulates in various treaty ports. We must also understand that the Russian embassies and consulates, in addition to their ordinary diplomatic and consular missions, also have the task of reddening China. Regarding this, we only need to look at the previous order to sever diplomatic relations with Russia to prove it. The order to revoke Russian consulates in December of the sixteenth year stated,</p>
<p>"It has been found that the Soviet Russian consulates and state-owned commercial organizations in the provinces under the rule of the National Government have always been places for propagating communism and hiding communists... On the 11th of this month, the Guangzhou Incident suddenly occurred. The Communist Party occupied the provincial capital, cut off transportation, burned the entire city, and carried out wanton killings. All of this was caused by the Communist Party using the Soviet Russian consulates and state-owned commercial organizations as places for issuing orders and instructions, which led to drastic changes. There is also the possibility of riots in other provinces. In order to maintain public order and prevent the spread, the government should immediately revoke recognition of the consuls of the Soviet Socialist Federal Republic in various provinces and order all state-owned commercial organizations of Soviet Russia in various provinces to stop business in order to eliminate the source of chaos and facilitate thorough investigation."</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's use of embassies and consulates to propagate communism, hide communists, and direct riots is an ironclad fact. At the time of the initial severance of diplomatic relations, the Communist Party only had small-scale riots, but now it has large-scale military operations, with more than 100,000 guns and occupying two or three provinces (referring to the seven major bandit areas in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi). The government troops have exhausted two years of efforts and have not yet eliminated a single point (the reasons why the government troops cannot eliminate them are in the "From Jiangxi to Hubei" article in the 25th issue of Minsheng). How can we immediately resume diplomatic relations with Russia and allow Russia to set up embassies and consulates everywhere, giving the Communist Party the convenience of supply, hiding, and command?</p>
<p>We understand that Russia's foreign strategy is to use China as its first line of defense, that is, to use China as its sacrifice. We also understand the close relationship between Russia and the Communist Party and the convenience that Russian embassies and consulates will give to the Communist Party after the resumption of diplomatic relations. We can conclude that the resumption of diplomatic relations is not accommodating the communists but helping the communists. If you do not support communism, you should not firmly advocate for the immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia. I have only met Mr. Chen once, but I know for sure that he is not a communist and does not support the murderous and arsonist bandits of communism. Why does he so firmly advocate for the immediate resumption of diplomatic relations, giving the communists convenience? Reporter Zeng of the Ta Wan Pao once asked Mr. Chen, "Why did you sever diplomatic relations with Russia in the first place? Now that you advocate for resuming diplomatic relations, have you resolved these conditions?" Based on the above discussion, we should answer as follows,</p>
<p>"In the beginning, we had to sever diplomatic relations because the Communist Party used Soviet Russian embassies and consulates to direct riots and propagate communism. Now, because the poison in our country is too deep and too great, it has already erupted throughout the country. It is not appropriate to let Russia set up embassies and consulates again for the use of the Communist Party, which is like adding fuel to the fire and stirring up the waves, accelerating China's demise. Therefore, it is not appropriate to immediately resume diplomatic relations with Russia at this time." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e106">Northeast Customs and Postal Issues <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Related to the Entire Northeast, Not a Simple Issue</p>
<p>The Government Formulates Concrete Plans in Preparation for Negotiations</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Speaks: A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Minister Guo Taiqi at his residence yesterday to inquire about his views on the puppet state's seizure of customs duties and postal rights in the Northeast. According to Guo, the puppet state's attempt to seize customs duties and postal rights in the Northeast is not a simple issue. Japan's presence in the Northeast began with instructing a small number of puppets to organize the so-called "Government of Manchuria," with Japanese advisors and consultants holding real power. Then, it openly recognized the puppet state, not hesitating to tear off its last mask, and finally seized customs duties and postal rights in the Northeast, undermining the integrity of China's administration. The so-called "Government of Manchuria" is merely a puppet organization, and Japan cannot shirk its responsibility for all its words and deeds. On the one hand, Japan signed a ceasefire agreement with us in Shanghai, hoping that the friendship between the two countries and the feelings of the two peoples would gradually recover. On the other hand, it acted arbitrarily in the Northeast. This contradictory behavior must be due to an error in the observation of the Japanese authorities or a contempt for our country. The three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory. The puppet state's attempt to seize customs duties and postal rights in the three provinces is by no means as simple as it appears on the surface. This is the entire issue of the Northeast, and it is the entire issue of China. How can it be merely a simple issue of customs duties and postal rights? It is hoped that the people and the government will cooperate effectively and actively recover the Northeast to protect the integrity of our country's land and administration, Guo said. After Guo finished speaking, the reporter asked about his date of going to Beijing. Guo said that he would go to Beijing in two or three days because there are still several matters that need to be discussed with President Wang and Minister Luo, as well as to say goodbye to Wang Luo and relatives and friends in Beijing. After staying in Beijing for a few days, he will return to Shanghai to pack up and prepare to go to England to take office at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Huang Naishu Speaks: A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Huang Naishu, the director of the Postal Administration, yesterday to inquire about his views on the Northeast postal issue and the measures to be taken. He received a very detailed answer. Huang said that the three northeastern provinces are divided into two postal districts: the Liaoning District and the Jilin-Heilongjiang District, with annual revenue of approximately 2 million yuan. Since the September 18th Incident, the puppet organization has been eager to seize it, but it has not yet succeeded. Recent reports indicate that the puppet state has decided to send personnel to forcibly seize it starting on July 1st and has already begun printing fake stamps, seemingly determined to achieve its seizure goal. However, the postal service is an integral part of the country's overall business and cannot be abandoned under any circumstances. If the puppet state really wants to send personnel to forcibly take over, then the postal organizations in the three provinces will have to be abolished uniformly, and all staff will be recalled uniformly. He also said that the postal revenue of the three northeastern provinces is very large. If it is seized, the annual revenue will be reduced, and the impact on the postal service itself will be significant. Currently, the government has formulated concrete plans in preparation for negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Municipal Government Announces Tax Reductions and Exemptions in the War Zone <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Revenue Reduced by One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai war, the masses in the war zone have been displaced, and their property and assets have been mostly lost. They are unable to recover at this time, and the future is dire. The victims after the disaster are looking to the government for assistance. If wartime taxes are still collected, it would not reflect the intention of caring for the people's hardships. Therefore, Mayor Wu convened the relevant bureaus to discuss the reduction and exemption of various taxes in the war zone. The final decision was announced to the public yesterday.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Announcement: Regarding the announcement, it is found that this city has suffered greatly from the war. All the people in the war zone have suffered great losses due to the sudden occurrence of the incident. They have been displaced and have endured great suffering. The municipal government is deeply saddened and sympathizes deeply. The policy of caring for the people in ancient times relies on tangible benefits for the people. Reducing taxes is a top priority. Therefore, the municipal government has carefully considered the situation of the house tax and various taxes in the war zone and has formulated various reduction and exemption measures to slightly lighten the burden on the disaster victims, so that they can spare their strength to engage in the recovery of their businesses. Then, the harvest in the sunset is still not too late. Now, the municipal government has specially recorded the tax reduction and exemption measures in the war zone and announced them to the public. This announcement,</p>
<p>Reduction and Exemption Measures: 1. House tax: fully exempt for the spring and summer seasons in the war zone. 2. Business rickshaws: excluding those that have been moved to the southern taxation office to pay taxes and operate, the tax collection for vehicles in the remaining war zones will begin in June. Public buses of Shanghai-Taicang Company and Chinese-owned companies will be taxed from the month of resumption of operation. 3. Advertising tax: exempt for two seasons. 4. Ferry tax: to be taxed from the month of resumption of ferry service. 5. Amusement tax: to be taxed from the date of resumption of business. 6. Stall tax: to be taxed from the month of resumption of stalls. 7. Vegetable market tax: to be taxed from the month of resumption of business. 8. Teahouse tax: to be taxed from the month of resumption of business. 9. Reduction and exemption of land tax: because it is related to the area under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, it should be determined after consultation. At the same time, the precedents for disaster relief and tax exemption should be followed, starting with investigation, distinguishing between severity, and jointly deciding by the relevant bureaus. 10. The two first and second civilian residences and the slaughterhouse buildings in Zhabei will be exempt from three months' rent for the second, third, and fourth classes. 11. The rent of the Wusong public property will be examined and verified after officials from the northern taxation office are instructed to investigate the situation.</p>
<p>Loss of Municipal Revenue: After the implementation of the above various tax reduction and exemption measures by the municipal government bureaus, according to Secretary-General Yu, the total loss is estimated to be over one million. However, municipal administration aspects such as sanitation and construction will continue to be actively carried out and will not be hindered by the reduction in revenue.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from National Taxes in the Songhu Area <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "The attached is a request for the matter. The association held its third membership meeting on June 18th. According to the proposals of members Ye Jiaxing, Mao Chunpu, Ling Zhijia, Zhu Binglu, Fei Tinghua, and Chen Wenming, and seconded by Jin Chuxiang, Qiu Liangyu, Jin Wenxiang, Lu Fusheng, Gu Jixiang, and Gu Hongxiang, to request the government to exempt the national and local taxes in the Songhu disaster area to facilitate recovery, the members' meeting on that day resolved to request the government to exempt the taxes. It has been the practice in our country to exempt the areas occupied and disturbed by robbers from paying inland grain and corvée for a certain period of time after the matter is settled. This can be traced back to the pre-Qing Dynasty. This year, the Japanese army occupied Songhu, and the devastation from the city to the countryside has been unprecedented in a century, which is in line with the precedent for exempting inland grain and corvée. In the past, the tax items were simple. In addition to inland grain and corvée, the country had no other sources of revenue. Now, the tax items have become more extensive, and the precedent for exemption should be extended to general national and local taxes, so that the war zone can be slightly relieved and the resumption of business can be hoped for. It is reasonable to record the case and request the approval of your Yuan, and to instruct the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government to separately exempt them, which would be for the public good."</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Japanese Army in District D to Withdraw in the Shortest Possible Time <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Results of Yesterday's Discussion by the Joint Committee</p>
<p>The Japanese Army at Gongda and Other Places May Also Withdraw Soon</p>
<p>The Joint Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday with representatives from both China and Japan to discuss the withdrawal of troops from District D. After one hour and thirty minutes of debate, the Japanese side agreed to completely withdraw the more than 3,000 Japanese Marine Corps troops in the area in the shortest possible time. The details of the discussion are as follows:</p>
<p>Questions Raised: Yesterday morning, the Chinese and Japanese representatives agreed in advance to meet at the American Consulate on Jiujiang Road at 10:00 AM. At that time, Chinese representative Yu Hongjun and Japanese representatives Okazaki and Yajima arrived on time. Regarding the content of the discussion, Mr. Yu first raised a question to the Japanese representative, saying that the Japanese army in District D had been repeatedly delayed and had not yet made a definite statement on withdrawal. The citizens of the city are quite skeptical and critical. I wonder when your side can actually implement the withdrawal. Please give a definite reply to strengthen friendship. At this point, the Japanese representative Okazaki stood up and replied, "District D was originally designated as a temporary stationing area for the Japanese army in the ceasefire agreement, so the Japanese army still needs to extend the time and may not be able to withdraw immediately."</p>
<p>Finally Agreed to Withdraw: Mr. Yu then refuted this by citing two points: According to the provisions of the ceasefire agreement, the temporary stationing area was designated for the Japanese army because it was not able to withdraw completely at once. Therefore, this area was designated as a temporary stationing area for the Japanese army. Now that the Japanese army has all returned home, this area should be completely returned to China for takeover within four weeks. (2) According to the agreement, the status quo before January 28th must be restored within four weeks. Therefore, the withdrawal of the Japanese army is very clear. The Japanese army has been overdue for a long time and has not withdrawn. The Chinese side sincerely believed that the withdrawal of the Japanese army may require some preparation in fact, so it did not urge it very much, waiting for your side to maintain its credibility and give a scheduled notice. Now that we have waited for a long time, we hope that your side will completely withdraw the troops in District D as soon as possible to fulfill the agreement and respect sovereignty. Then the Japanese representative pondered for a while and changed his tone and said, "After the troops have made some preparations, they will withdraw as soon as possible." The debate ended at 11:30 AM and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Also Withdrawing from Four Other Places: Regarding the Japanese army at Gongda Yarn Factory, Tongwen College, Rihua Yarn Factory, and Toyota Yarn Factory, the Japanese side had long agreed to withdraw within the day, but it has not yet been implemented as of yesterday, leading to the speculation that the Japanese army at the four places is still a problem. At the same time, the Japanese side countered the propaganda, saying that the Japanese army at the four places would never withdraw (see Shanghai Daily News). However, according to Yu Hongjun of the Joint Committee, the Japanese side has agreed to withdraw the Japanese army at the four places, which will of course be withdrawn and is not a problem. In addition, the request of Japanese residents to organize a patrol team has been investigated and is not a fact.</p>
<p>Songhu Committee Submits Document: Tang Chengzong and Liu Ziwen, members of the Wusong Municipal Committee, submitted a document to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating: "The attached is a request for negotiations to withdraw the Japanese army from the occupied area as soon as possible in order to stabilize the people's hearts and benefit the recovery. Since the completion of the agreement, the Wusong area has been taken over by us, and the people have gradually moved back and built houses to live in. It is estimated that 90% of the rural areas have been occupied, while only 30% of the town area has been occupied. The reason for this is that the Huafeng Yarn Factory in the west of the town still has dozens of Japanese Marine Corps troops stationed there. The people have been like startled birds after this catastrophe, and the location of the Japanese Marine Corps is close at hand. No wonder the people are hesitant to move forward. Moreover, unemployed vagrants deliberately spread rumors to create chaos, and ignorant people are even more panicked. The committee members have heard and seen this and cannot remain silent. Therefore, they have prepared a document and requested the mayor to seriously negotiate to ensure that the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in the Huafeng Yarn Factory is withdrawn as soon as possible in order to stabilize the people's hearts and benefit the recovery."</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Two Parties Have Agreed to Set a Date to Continue Discussing the Draft Agreement on Building Roads Beyond the Concession <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Received the Approval Yesterday</p>
<p>Date Agreed with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The case of the Shanghai Municipal Government negotiating with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to take back the roads built beyond the concession: After the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government and the Chief Executive of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, signed the draft agreement outline, the procedures only require the approval of the superiors of both parties to be realized. The draft agreement was submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Shanghai Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. Yesterday, the formal approval of the central government came to Shanghai. The content principles were not changed in general, except for slight modifications in the wording. After receiving the approval, Secretary-General Yu immediately re-appointed Fessenden of the Municipal Council to continue consultations on further measures at 12:30 PM this Friday (June 24th).</p>

<h3 id="e112">Armory Shutdown <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Song Ren is Scheduled to Complete Closure by the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Armory has received an order from the Ministry of Military Administration to cease operations. The handling committee has ordered that the existing armory machinery be distributed to the Jinling, Hanyang, and Gongxian armories. Currently, Song Ren's mission is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. Future disposition matters will be the responsibility of the handling committee. Regarding the reasons for the shutdown, our reporter has learned the following summary:</p>
<p>Process of Shutdown The factory was originally transformed from a Western-owned shipbuilding factory in Hongkou, purchased during the Qing Dynasty under Li Hongzhang. It underwent several expansions and was moved to Gaochang Temple, totaling fifty to sixty years of operation. During the recent Shanghai battle, workers were dismissed, leaving only the artillery factory to continue working. Two weeks before the war subsided, the labor union, for the sake of maintaining operations, sent representatives twice to the Beijing Military Affairs Committee, Ministry of Military Administration, and Armory Department to request resumption of work. It is said that when the representatives met Chairman Chiang at the Military Affairs Committee, Chiang stated that the matter fell under the scope of military administration and instructed them to seek solutions from the Ministry of Military Administration. The Ministry informed them that work could resume within three weeks, and that funding from superiors had been approved at 80,000 yuan per month, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. Unexpectedly, last month, the Ministry sent Western consultant Bloomai to Shanghai to inspect the factory. After assessing the situation of the war, Bloomai reported that it was not appropriate to establish armory facilities near commercial ports. Furthermore, there were proposals in Shanghai in the fourteenth year of the Republic to relocate. Therefore, he submitted a detailed proposal to the Military Affairs Committee. The committee discussed and agreed that the proposal was accurate. Chairman Chiang approved the proposal, leading to the shutdown and merger of the factory.</p>
<p>Post-Shutdown Handling The post-shutdown handling committee of the factory has already convened in Beijing. However, the committee member list differs slightly from yesterday's report. The committee is set at eight members, including the directors of the Jinling Armory, Li Chenggan, the Hanyang Armory, Huang Gongzhu, and the Shanghai Armory, Song Ren. Additionally, one person will be nominated from the materials committee of the Armory Department, and the heads of the design, general affairs, audit, and supervision sections of the Armory Department will jointly handle the matter.</p>
<p>Current Situation Before the war, the factory had over 4,000 employees. Due to the war, many workers were dismissed. Currently, there are fewer than 400 employees. Investigations reveal that the current artillery factory has over 180 workers. The gun factory, bullet factory, shell factory, medicine factory, and machinery factory each have twelve workers. Various department staff number over sixty, and the remaining security team consists of one squad of over thirty, totaling three hundred forty to fifty people.</p>
<p>Labor Union's Intentions Yesterday, the Guowen News Agency reporter inquired with the labor union about their intentions. The workers stated that the results of their petition in Beijing the previous week were very positive, making the current situation unexpected. The labor union plans to continue petitioning the government based on three reasons: (1) Moving the Shanghai factory's machinery to Jinling, Hanyang, and Gongxian would require new factory buildings, which is unnecessary. (2) Moving machinery from Hangzhou back to Shanghai is closer and more convenient. (3) Abandoning the existing machine foundations and building new ones would be very costly. However, the government is already taking concrete actions, making it difficult to reverse the decision. The factory previously sent Hu Sihong, head of the inspection department, and two others to Beijing to explain the historical situation, not to request a reversal of the decision.</p>
<p>Orders Not Received A Datong News Agency reporter visited the armory yesterday to interview Director Song Ren. Song sent Zhang Bochou, the head of the document section, to represent him. According to Zhang, the orders from the Ministry of Military Administration and the Armory Department regarding whether the factory would shut down have not yet arrived. Until the orders are received, work will continue as usual to maintain the status quo. Regarding the mission of Hu Sihong, head of the inspection department, and others to Beijing, Zhang stated that he was not aware of it.</p>
<p>Party Support The armory has attached branches of the Chinese Nationalist Party Shanghai District 25, 28, 30, and 31. Most of the party members are workers at the factory. Since receiving news of the factory shutdown, they have gathered to discuss and petition the upper-level party organization to forward the matter to the Central Government, requesting the military department to withdraw the previous proposal and restore work.</p>
<h3 id="e113">End of Labor Strike at the Concession Telephone Company <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Strike Committee Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>Painfully Resuming Work Today</p>
<p>After the labor strike at the Concession Telephone Company, the strike committee, due to a portion of workers resuming work without authorization and facing adverse conditions, ordered all workers to painfully resume work starting today. They also issued a declaration preparing for a second struggle. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Resumption Since a small number of workers at the Xinzhongyang Branch on Fujian Road, the Fanan Branch on Bixun Road, and the Beihang Branch on Haining Road resumed work the day before yesterday, the engineers of the company, including Wilson, contacted various workers and persuaded them to return to work. At the same time, the police department dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to station at various branches to protect those resuming work and to drive away the liaison office of the strike committee at No. 85, Avenue Edward VII, preventing workers and the strike committee from communicating. From yesterday onwards, workers from the Jiangxi Road Headquarters, Fujian Road, Haining Road, Huishan Road, Matt Hess Road, Yangshupu, Bixun Road, Yidingpan Road, and Trinity Yin Road branches have successively returned to work, accounting for seven-tenths of the total workforce.</p>
<p>Meeting Prohibited The strike committee originally planned to gather at 10:00 AM yesterday at No. 513, Far East Hotel, to hold an emergency meeting to discuss whether to continue the strike and adopt effective measures to deal with the company. However, at 8:30 AM, the Public Concession Police Department dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to prevent the meeting and drive away the striking workers. They also notified the accounting department of the Far East Hotel to prohibit renting the premises to telephone workers as an office. As a result, the striking workers withdrew from the temporary meeting of the strike committee and continued to hold discussions on the roadside in front of the Far East Hotel, but were again prevented by the police department, making it impossible to hold a mass meeting.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting In view of the fact that the mass meeting was prevented by the police department, the strike committee held an emergency meeting at a teahouse on Fujian Road at 11:00 AM. More than 100 striking workers from Jiangxi Road and Fujian Road attended. The chairman first reported on the current situation and the strike trend, noting that the environment was very harsh. They then began discussions. The striking workers believed that the foremen had deceived and pressured workers to return to work, and advocated using force to deal with the company and destructive measures. They supported the strike committee in continuing the strike. The strike committee, seeing that a large portion of the workers had already resumed work without authorization and that the strike trend had tragically failed, advised them to painfully resume work. The following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Painfully resume work; (2) Issue a declaration; (3) Prepare for a second struggle. Finally, they dispersed after shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Order The strike committee issued an order stating: "Fellow workers, our strike this time has been undermined by the sabotage of traitors and running dogs, the oppression of the imperialist police department, and the lack of internal solidarity among the workers. We have failed to attract a majority of workers to work under the strike committee. As a result, today's strike cannot be sustained. Therefore, we have no choice but to painfully resume work and preserve our strength to prepare for the next more determined strike. We hope that all workers will resume work in an organized manner this afternoon and tomorrow morning, strengthen our own organization, resist the attacks of the capitalists, and prepare to fight for the next victory. This notice is issued by the Shanghai Telephone Company Employees' Strike Committee on June 21."</p>
<p>Declaration of Resumption To all Shanghai workers and people from all walks of life, we, the more than three thousand telephone workers, have been on strike against the American imperialist capitalists for thirteen days in pursuit of our own interests. However, due to the oppression of the imperialist police department, the prohibition of our meetings, the surveillance of our organization, the arrest of our fellow workers, the sabotage of traitors and running dogs, the deception and intimidation of workers by foremen to return to work, and the undermining of worker solidarity, as well as the unsound internal organization of the workers, the lack of solidarity, the failure of the strike committee to include representatives of workers from all departments, the lack of close relationship with the masses, and the failure to mobilize the majority of workers to participate in the work of the strike committee, we have not been able to organize the masses in a timely manner to attack the enemy. Therefore, although we have expelled from the strike committee those wavering, compromising, advocating unconditional resumption of work, and requesting official and party "arbitration and mediation" corrupt elements that undermine the strike, we have still failed to launch a broader mass of positive action to achieve the victory of the strike. Under the oppression of the imperial authorities and the sabotage of traitors and running dogs, this strike has failed. Although we have not achieved a conditional victory, our three thousand workers' heroic struggle has given the American imperialist capitalists a great and meaningful blow. During the strike, we have learned many experiences and lessons. We have recognized that foremen and others are helping the capitalists to undermine our strike. We can only achieve our victory by establishing a strong strike committee that includes representatives of active workers from all departments, resolutely launching positive actions by the masses, eliminating traitors and running dogs, and persistently attacking the capitalists. Although we have returned to work, the conditions have not been met. At the same time, the capitalists and all traitors and running dogs will inevitably launch even tighter attacks against us, firing our workers. Therefore, although our struggle has not yielded results, we must continue to fight for our conditions. We cannot abandon the weapons of struggle in the slightest. We must continue to unite our strength, use the lessons of this strike to correct our mistakes and shortcomings, and prepare for the next more determined and greater struggle and strike. Failure is the mother of success. We will not be discouraged or passive. We will continue to unite with all Shanghai workers and the people to fight for our common victory and against our common enemy. We are very grateful to all sectors for their assistance in this strike. But we still hope that all sectors will continue to assist us. We will always stand with all Shanghai workers to oppose imperialist capitalists. Our final slogans are: (1) Down with the traitors and running dogs who undermine the strike! (2) Prepare for the next strike! (3) Oppose the capitalists' attacks on us, oppose firing workers, demand increased wages, restore Sunday work, and pay wages for the strike period. Consolidate our unity and organize our own telephone workers' union. (4) All Shanghai workers unite! (5) Down with the imperialist capitalists! Telephone Workers' Strike Committee, June 21.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Han Guojun and Others Request Allocation of Grand Canal Construction Funds <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Han Guojun, Ma Shijie, and Others Send a Telegram:</p>
<p>Mr. Liangcai, transferred to Director Xi, Construction and Relief Office of the National Government Relief Committee,</p>
<p>Last year, the Grand Canal's dikes collapsed in over twenty locations, large and small, spanning nine hundred zhang. The estimated construction cost was four million five hundred thousand yuan. Due to difficulties in raising funds, it was reduced to three million two hundred thousand yuan. Additionally, twenty-four thousand yuan was added for crushed stone on the west dike, totaling three million four hundred and forty thousand yuan, already the bare minimum. Repairing the breached dikes is extremely difficult. In the past, the repair of just one breach at Qingshuitan cost several million taels. Every time the Yellow River breaches, it requires no less than several million yuan. There are clear precedents for this. The ten counties east of the Grand Canal cover an area of one hundred thousand square li and have a population of over ten million. They rely entirely on the east and west dikes for protection. This time, the entire Grand Canal was impacted and severely damaged by the water. The earthworks repair is urgent and must be completed quickly. However, some areas may not be solid enough, requiring reconstruction. The Gaobao and Jiangdu sections of the west dike, as well as the Laisheng'an section of the east dike, which are being assisted by your committee, account for less than two-tenths of the entire project. The overestimation of costs and the difficulties of the work should be carefully considered. Currently, eight-tenths of the entire project will be completed, but there is still a shortage of over five hundred and fifty thousand yuan. Work has been suspended pending the arrival of funds. With the water level rising slightly, the overall situation is extremely worrying. According to National Government Instruction No. 510 of the twentieth year of the Republic, "This year's floods have caused multiple breaches in the Grand Canal dikes. The twelfth regular meeting of this government resolved to allocate one million yuan in cash from the Relief Committee for Disaster Relief to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to quickly handle the Grand Canal dike repair project." Furthermore, Central Government Instruction No. 579 approved the early allocation of funds from the additional levies on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and other locations. Therefore, your committee has the authority to allocate these funds. As for the Provincial Government's borrowing of 10,000 tons of American flour from your committee to finance the Grand Canal project, this is a separate matter that will be repaid with construction bonds on a fixed schedule. To date, we have only received 545,000 yuan. We urgently hope that your committee will quickly allocate the remaining funds to assist the project. Currently, the people of the ten counties north of the Yangtze River suffered a terrible water disaster last year. Countless people died not from drowning but from starvation. In recent months, they have been able to work the land in a state of groaning and distress, hoping that the repair of the Grand Canal dikes will be completed soon. If work is suspended due to lack of funds, resulting in another catastrophe, then the overall situation in Jiangsu will be unbearable to witness. You, Director, are a native of Jiangsu and are dedicated to your duties. You must be determined to complete the Grand Canal dike repair project as soon as possible. We urge you to report to your committee and immediately allocate the central government funds to the Provincial Government for distribution to the project sites to avoid danger caused by suspending work and waiting for funds. In addition to sending letters to Mr. Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, and Zhu Dexuan to convey everything in person, we are sending this telegram for your consideration. We hope that you will understand. Standing Committee of the Post-Disaster Relief Association for the Huai Dike Water Disaster in Northern Jiangsu, Han Guojun, Ma Shijie, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Zeng Yangfu, Director of Zhejiang Construction Department, Comes to Shanghai <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Continuing to Negotiate Loan for Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu, Commissioner of Zhejiang Province and Director of the Construction Department, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to continue negotiating all matters with the Qixin Banking Syndicate in order to finalize the loan for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. The Huadong News Agency reporter specially interviewed Mr. Zeng at his hotel. According to him, the progress of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the methods for relieving new and old cocoon silk and issuing loans were quite detailed. The following is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Loan for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway According to Mr. Zeng, the original plan for completing the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was to continue construction from Jinhua, passing through Tangxi and other three counties, and reaching Jiangshan. The section of highway from Jiangshan County to Guangfeng, Jiangxi, has already been built and can be connected. Regarding the counties from Jiangshan to the Fujian border, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has consulted with the Fujian Provincial Government to jointly construct it to facilitate the suppression of bandits. Therefore, the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is of great importance to the security of Zhejiang and eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian. From Jinhua to Jiangshan, the entire line is approximately 168 kilometers long. The estimated cost for construction and materials is 7 million yuan. However, the construction funds for Zhejiang Province are only 300,000 yuan per year, so it is necessary to raise funds. Recently, Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, went to Beijing specifically for this matter to negotiate a 200,000 pound Gengzi Indemnity loan (approximately 3.4 million Chinese currency). Zhu Jiaju, Chairman of the Gengzi Indemnity Committee, has already approved it. My visit to Shanghai this time is related to project funding. I plan to transfer the Hangzhou Power Plant to the Qixin Banking Syndicate, which could yield 1 million yuan. The banking syndicate has informally approved it. However, the banking syndicate requires an interest rate of over 1%, while I advocate a maximum of 1%. After further negotiations, a satisfactory agreement can be reached.</p>
<p>Relief for Old Cocoons and Old Silk Regarding the promotion and sale of old cocoons and old silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Construction Department previously consulted with the Jiangsu Industrial Department and agreed to allocate 4 million taels of silver to subsidize silk cocoon merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to cover the losses from promoting and selling old cocoons and old silk. However, the Zhejiang provincial treasury is extremely strained. However, relieving the current decline in silk cocoons is an urgent matter. Therefore, I drafted a plan, consulted with Jiangsu Province, and issued a relief silk cocoon treasury bond of 2.2 million taels, starting on June 1, 21st year of the Republic, with a monthly interest rate of 0.5%, and a term of 50 months, with full repayment of principal and interest. Zhejiang Province will use the 150,000 yuan in funds monthly allocated to the province by the central government due to the reduction in levies as a guarantee fund. This plan has been submitted by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to the Ministry of Finance. I previously came to Shanghai once for this purpose. The Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen, has agreed to the issuance of treasury bonds and relief of silk cocoons. The Ministry of Finance has also telegraphed Zhejiang Province, approving the issuance. However, the articles of association and repayment schedule must be submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan for consultation with the Legislative Yuan for formal approval before they can be implemented.</p>
<p>Relief for New Silk and New Cocoons Regarding the issue of relieving new cocoons and new silk, I previously consulted with the Zhejiang business community and raised 1.8 million yuan, which was entrusted to various banks and money shops to lend to cocoon businesses in various places. The government and businesses jointly organized the Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Loan Pledge Committee to handle the pledging of cocoon loans. In addition to Hangzhou cocoon leaves, cocoon merchants from other counties and regions can come to the province to borrow money from the Pledge Committee to purchase cocoons. The original procedure for borrowing money required cocoon merchants to provide 40% cash as a guarantee and use the loan of 40% to collect 60% of the dry cocoons as collateral. This year, the spring cocoons are withering and unable to operate, plunging to a thousand zhang. Originally intended to relieve the cocoon industry, the regulations have been changed to show consideration for cocoon merchants, and consulted with the Department of Finance, and the provision for Jiang Cocoon Merchants to find a guarantee and supply 40% of cash has been changed to 30%. The two departments have ordered the Zhejiang Cocoon Loan Pledge Committee to comply, etc.</p>

<p>The Fujian Overseas Shanghai Associations United Council previously telegraphed the Central Government and the Military Affairs Committee, stating matters concerning the pacification of Fujian Province. Yesterday, the Military Affairs Committee sent a telegram saying: "To all comrades of the Fujian Overseas Shanghai Associations United Council, your telegram has been received and read.

<p>Following Approval of Amended Articles</p>
<p>The "Relief Association for Families of Martyrs Who Died for the Country" received Official Letter No. 1961 from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan yesterday, approving the Ministry of Interior's Official Letter No. 33. The letter stated, "With regards to your dispatch No. 1703, the President's instruction is: The memorial submitted by Xu Shiying and other standing committee members of the 'Relief Association for Families of Martyrs Who Died for the Country' regarding the drafting of articles of association and requesting review and filing should be submitted to the Ministry of Interior for discussion and reply." Accordingly, a copy of the original document is enclosed for your reference. Also enclosed is the original memorial and a copy of the articles of association. After review, the nineteen articles of association proposed by the association are generally feasible. However, Article 4, Section 1, states that old folks' homes are easily confused with those established by relief institutions in various provinces and cities. For the sake of honoring the direct elders of martyrs who died for the country, it is suggested that the name be changed to "Respect for Elders Home" to show encouragement and virtue. Article 2, Section 2, which refers to the "Hall of Pure Virtue," conflicts with the second article of the "Regulations on Commendation." It is suggested to change it to "Hall of Consolation" to express the meaning of consolation. Also, the phrase "charity halls" under the "Hall of Pure Virtue" or similar organizations should be changed to "charitable organizations." In Article 3, Section 3, the phrase "those with excellent grades can be further trained" is changed to "children of revolutionary meritorious personnel should be handled in accordance with the regulations on tuition fees" to show preferential treatment. In Article 5, the last paragraph, "teach them agricultural affairs," is changed to "teach them agricultural skills" to be more explicit. Are these suggestions appropriate? We are replying for your review and submission, etc. This has been approved. The President's instruction is: Approved as requested by the Ministry of Interior. The "Relief Association for Families of Martyrs Who Died for the Country" and the Ministry of Interior should be informed separately. Apart from sending separate notices, this letter is for your information, etc. It is now reported that the association has amended each point as instructed by the Ministry of Interior and has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for filing.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Public Letter from All Coal Dealers in the French Concession <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Revocation of the Order and the Cancellation of the Business Tax</p>
<p>The new "Regulations for the Management of Hard Fuels" promulgated by the French Concession Municipal Council, which levies a business tax, has already prompted the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Coal Industry Association, and the New West District 12th Road Business Association of the French Concession to successively send letters to the French Concession Municipal Council, requesting them to consider the merchants' difficulties, revoke the order, and cancel the business tax to alleviate the merchants' plight. This has been reported in previous news. It is now known that all the coal dealers in the French Concession, including Jin Shun, Xin Shun, Yi Shunxing, Yi Hexing, Xin Da, Xie Taicheng Ji, Kailin, Sen Shun, Xiang He, Yan Jing, Ping Ping, Zhi Cheng, Lao Qia Yuan, Tong Fu, Qian Shunchang, Qian Dachang, Xie He Shun, Gong Changxin, Rong Tai, Da Feng Yong, Song Tai, Gong Changyu, Zhe Tai Xie Ji, Wan Xing, Xiang Tai, Lao Jiu Da, Tong Tai, Qian Feng, Shun Xing, Shun Cheng, Xin Kang, Qia Sheng, Qi Tai, Feng Tai, Piao Zhao Shun, Wu Taixing, Jin Taixiang, Da Xing, Xing Long, Pu Da, Song Sheng, Shun Xin, Tai Xingyi, Xiang Xin, Lao Qian Yuan, Sen Kang, Yong Sheng, Qian Cheng, Xie Chang, He Fa, Tong Li, Xin Chang, Ye Sen Tai, Tang Longchang, Yong Li, Qian Fengxiang, Sen Tai, Xing Sheng, Yuan Chang, Tian Cheng, Yi Tai, Yuan Tai, Qing Tai, Yang Ji, Hong Tai, Yuan Tai, Sen Chang, Mao Chang, Yuan Da, Fu Chang Tai, Sen Tai Hua Ji, Xiang Da, Tong Yuanxiang, Cheng Chang, Qian Wan Yuan, Jin Tai, Yu Cheng, Shun Tai, Yuan Sheng, Xie Chang, Xin Xing, Ju Kang, Shi Wanxing, Yuan Mao, Qian Da You, Ji Feng, Ji Tai, Shun Chang, Sen Da, Yong Changxiang, Xin Tai, Shun Tai, Yong Tai, Qian Wan Yuan, and more than 200 other companies, collectively presented a letter to the General Manager of the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are requesting the revocation of the order and the cancellation of the business tax on hard fuels to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and stabilize business operations. Coal dealers have established businesses in the French Concession, formally paying taxes, and struggling to maintain operations. Unexpectedly, your office has promulgated new regulations for the management of hard fuels (coal, coal balls, and firewood, etc.) in warehouses or stores, requiring the payment of an investigation fee of two yuan and a license fee of three yuan every six months. This business tax is about to be implemented and collected. The coal business (i.e., operating hard fuels) has low profits and high expenses. It is well known that business is only booming in the winter and depressed in the summer. The coal dealers are not able to afford the business tax. Moreover, such a business tax is unprecedented in the Chinese Concession and the International Settlement, and is also a new thing in the French Concession. Furthermore, hard fuels are daily necessities for residents. Therefore, in the business tax rate table formulated by the Chinese Concession Municipal Government, only the coal ball industry is taxed at one-thousandth, and coal is not taxed. If your office insists on implementing the business tax, it will directly increase the burden on coal dealers and indirectly affect the livelihood of the people. It will also force all coal dealers operating hard fuels in the French Concession to move to the Chinese Concession or the International Settlement. The coal dealers feel that the regulations are difficult to bear and that the tax is impractical. Therefore, we jointly sign and seal this letter, urging your office to consider the merchants' difficulties, revoke the order, and cancel the harsh hard fuel business tax to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and stabilize business operations. We implore you to review and implement this request and to grant a reply to the leading coal dealers to reassure the people and comfort the public. Respectfully submitted to the General Manager of the French Concession Municipal Council in Shanghai."</p>

<p>Creditor Wins Lawsuit in Trial</p>
<p>Zhengyi Bank on Jiangxi Road declared bankruptcy on November 19, 1920. Various firms that had deposits with the bank demanded compensation, but were refused on the grounds that the bank was a limited company. As a result, the creditors formed the Zhenggyi Bank Creditors' Association and elected Qian Xuanqing as their representative to sue the chairman of the board of Zhenggyi Bank, Ye Hongying, and others in the Shanghai First Special District Court, requesting repayment of the debts. On June 14, at 2 p.m., the presiding judge, Xiao Xiebin, took the bench in the seventh courtroom. The plaintiff representative, Qian Xuanqing, along with the attorneys Hu Jue and Chou Kaizuo, appeared in court. The defendants, Ye Hongying, and others, did not appear, but their attorneys, Wei Wenhan and Wu Guochang, did. After a lengthy debate, the plaintiff's attorney, Hu Jue, presented documents from the Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which stated that the Zhenggyi Bank had obtained its business license from the Ministry of Finance and had not legally obtained a limited company license from the Ministry of Industry. Therefore, it was naturally a partnership. The distinction between limited and unlimited liability should be based on the Company Law, which went into effect on July 2, 1931. Since the defendant did not obtain a license from the Ministry of Industry or register with the Bureau of Social Affairs, which is the competent authority, and report to the Ministry of Industry for a license, as required by Article 21 of the Company Law, the defendant's reliance on the illegal license issued by the Shanghai County Magistrate's Office and the Financial Supervision Administration of the Ministry of Finance is legally baseless. The business license allows both limited and unlimited liability companies to operate. The plaintiff's legal and evidentiary submissions are sufficient to prove that the defendant is a partnership and should be jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff's debt of 33,635.22 yuan and the statutory interest for the delay. The defendant's attorneys, Wei Wenhan and Wu Guochang, argued that the defendant was a limited company and had a license from the Shanghai Public Concession Financial Supervision Administration of the Ministry of Finance. They requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. The court announced that the judgment would be pronounced at 1 p.m. on June 20. The judgment was pronounced at 2 p.m. on the afternoon of the previous day. The main points were that the defendant should repay the plaintiff 19,143.1 taels of silver, which should be offset by the assets of Zhenggyi Bank. If the assets are insufficient, the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the remaining amount, and the statutory interest for the delay shall be calculated from November 19 of last year until the end of the execution. The remainder of the plaintiff's requests was rejected, and the litigation costs were borne by the defendant.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Ye Shantao Appeals Case of Being Accused of Forging Documents <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Judgment Set for the 27th</p>
<p>The case of Ye Shantao, Zhang Zhengji, Zhu Chengfei and others forging documents was previously litigated in the First Special District Court. The initial trial ruled that the plaintiff's evidence was insufficient and that Ye was not guilty. Subsequently, an appeal was filed with the Second Branch of the High Court, which also held several hearings. The focus of the dispute was whether Ye Shantao was a director of the Gongfa Company founded by Huang Chu Jiu. Ye wanted to prove that he was not a director of Gongfa Company, so he presented a letter from Huang Chu Jiu withdrawing Ye's directorship. This letter was not written by Huang himself but by his secretary. Therefore, Zhang Zhengji and others suspected that Ye had forged it after Huang's death. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit for the crime of forging documents. At the last court hearing, the plaintiff insisted that the court obtain the director's meeting minutes from the High Court branch to prove that Ye had indeed received director's fees. Yesterday was another court hearing, and both parties appeared in court to be examined. As the evidence in the case was complete and the trial had been held several times, the facts of the case were clear. Therefore, the judge briefly questioned both parties and then began the debate. The lawyer Yan, representing the appellant, first stated that the case began after the Gongfa Company, founded by Huang Chu Jiu, went bankrupt and no assets were found. After liquidation, each creditor could only receive 20%, and the remaining amount could only be claimed from its directors. Ye wanted to avoid the responsibility of being a director, so he presented a letter from Huang to him. Whether the letter was written by Huang himself has been proven to be false. Furthermore, the director must obtain the approval of the board of directors to withdraw. However, there is no resolution on Huang's withdrawal in the board minutes. Furthermore, the letter from Huang Chu Jiu to Gan Yuesong was also written by the secretary, and the handwriting of the two letters is the same. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify that the letter from Huang to Gan is an ordinary commercial correspondence. Why is it not personally signed and sealed to resign from his directorship? As for Ye's claim that he was a director because he had lost 300,000 yuan with Huang in the exchange and was given the title of director, with a monthly fee of 40 yuan to compensate for his loss, it is not possible to compensate for his 300,000 yuan loss by paying 40 yuan a month for a thousand years, etc. The lawyer Lu Shaoxu, representing the respondent, then argued that at the court hearing in early spring, the plaintiff stated that he did not know whether the letter of resignation was true or false. Therefore, the purpose of his prosecution for forging documents was lost. The minutes obtained from the High Court branch showed that Ye was indeed named in the minutes before 1927, but not after that. Furthermore, the Gongfa Company's directors were limited to nine people, and three supervisors. This number was already complete. If Ye Shantao was added, wouldn't there be ten directors? Furthermore, the letter of resignation was written in 1927. How could Ye know that there would be litigation in the future and forge a letter in advance to shirk responsibility? As it was late, the court announced the end of the debate and set the judgment for the 27th of this month. If either party has any further comments, they may submit supplementary briefs within three days.</p>

<p>Should be Tried by the Third Branch of the High Court</p>
<p>Trial Opened Yesterday, No Spectators Allowed</p>
<p>Cao Qingcheng, a supervisor of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau from Hubei, was assassinated in the French Concession last month. Jin Shoupei from Jiangwan was mistakenly identified and shot dead by thugs. Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police Department immediately apprehended the suspects Liu Guobao from Sichuan and Li Shiying from Henan on the spot. Four other related persons were subsequently arrested overnight: Zhu Jinming from Hangzhou and Li Zecai from Anhui. Guns and other items were seized and taken to the police station. It was found that they were also related to the case of Wang Bin, a supervisor of the Garrison Command, who was killed. The Second Special District Court prosecuted them for murder under Articles 282 and 284 of the Criminal Code. After interrogation, it was found that the case was related to politics and the jurisdiction was wrong. The case was transferred to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for trial. After receiving the case file for review, the Third Branch of the High Court summoned the families of the victims to the court yesterday, and notified the police lawyers and the detectives handling the case. The judge opened the second criminal court at 3:00 p.m. As spectators were not allowed, the interrogation transcript could not be recorded.

<h3 id="e131">Ye Qinghe Implicated in Japanese Morphine Manufacturing Case <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Ye Arrested in Sanatorium</p>
<p>Ordered to Pay 30,000 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>The Japanese-run morphine manufacturing plant set up by Nakamura at No. 18 Sandefang, Xijiaxing Road, Hongkou, was discovered by Chief Detective Wang Changgen of the Public Concession Police Department's General Inspection Office on the 23rd of last month. Together with Western Detective Pan Gengquan, they went to Nakamura's residence to arrest him and handed him over to the Japanese Consulate for trial. They also arrested nine Chinese persons, including Fang Yinbao, Su Ahui, and Diao Jinsheng. Morphine drugs and equipment were seized and transferred to the First Special District Court for investigation. Wang Kaiyan, a staff member in the organ, was released without charge. The other eight persons, including Fang Yinbao, were sentenced to imprisonment and fines, as reported in detail in the newspapers. However, Ye Qinghe from Fujian, the mastermind of the case, was still at large. It was discovered by Detective Wang Changgen, who was handling the case, that Ye had checked into Room 208 of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium on Rue de la Gare in the French Concession and was registered under a citizen's name. On the night of the 4th of this month, he worked with detectives from the French Concession Police Department to arrest Ye and hand him over to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. He was released on bail pending trial. The First Special District Court issued a warrant the other day, ordering the judicial police to bring Ye back. Yesterday morning, he was brought before the First High Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendant, Ye Qinghe, opened Guomin Pharmacy in the French Concession, and that Fang Yin, etc., who had already been punished, were partners in the pharmacy. On the 3rd of this month, the defendant took a yellow car and used the alias Shen, signing in Western script, claiming to be in the hospital for medical treatment. When the police sent detectives to Xijiaxing Road to solve the case, they found envelopes, stationery, etc., all with the words "Guomin Pharmacy." There is now a witness, Wang Jinyan, who used to work in the private morphine manufacturing plant set up by the defendant, so he knows the defendant's name, and he committed robbery of opium at the former Mixed Court. Wang Jinyan testified that he was a tinsmith and had worked in the morphine factory set up by the defendant at No. 15 Jiaye Road, Great World, so he knew it. After the factory moved, he went there once. Ye Qinghe confessed that he was one of the shareholders of Guomin Pharmacy and did not know Fang Yinbao. The person in charge was Jin Jinhua. He knew nothing about morphine manufacturing. He also retained lawyer Jiang Yiping to apply for bail. Judge Qiao Wanxuan reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant Ye Qinghe to pay 30,000 yuan bail pending another trial.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Judgment in Substandard and Counterfeit Goods Case <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhengda Sentenced to Three Months</p>
<p>Fine of Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Meilun Weaving Factory and Hongzhang Dyeing Factory reported that Zhenkang Cloth Store on Xiamen Road was selling substandard goods under the brand names of the two factories. The police were notified and sent detectives to Zhenkang Store, where they seized many boxes of cloth and arrested Gu Zhengda, a partner in the store, and handed him over to the First Special District Court on charges of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge opened the court to continue the trial. According to Gu Zhengda's confession, the Hongzhang labels affixed to the cloth boxes were because the cloth in the boxes was dyed by Hongzhang and was not counterfeit. The cloth had been mortgaged to the Tongchun Qianzhuang on Tianjin Road. Yu Futian, the representative of Tongchun Qianzhuang, and lawyer Wu Linkun appeared in court, stating that the Zhenkang cloth pledged to them was introduced by Gu Disheng of Desheng Cotton Cloth Store and was processed legally. Subsequently, the defendant's defense lawyer Fan Gang presented the transaction contract between Zhenkang and Meilun Factory, proving that Zhenkang's cloth was indeed purchased from Meilun. Gu Zhengda continued to confess that this time was actually because Lu Junhui of Hongzhang hated him for not contacting him for transactions, so he could not get a commission, which led to this case. However, according to the Xia representative of Meilun, they had transactions with Zhenkang last year. This year, the cloth sold to Zhenkang was bleached striped cloth. Lu Junhui of Hongzhang admitted to dyeing the cloth for Zhenkang but denied putting the labels on the dyed cloth. Finally, the police lawyer Hu Jiabao, the two plaintiffs' lawyers Chen Tingrui, and the defendant's lawyer debated with each other to the end. Judge Ge immediately pronounced judgment in court, sentencing Gu Zhengda to three months in prison and fining him one thousand yuan. If he is unable to pay, he may be imprisoned for one day for every three yuan, but not more than one year. The cloth and other items were confiscated. The defendant, upon hearing the judgment, expressed dissatisfaction and his lawyer Fan Gang immediately declared an appeal, which was granted by the judge. The police were ordered to take Gu back to the police station for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Meeting of the Postal Workers' Union <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of comprehensively promoting union affairs and consolidating the foundation of the union, the local Postal Workers' Union held a general membership meeting at 10:30 AM yesterday in the courtyard of the Postal Administration Bureau. More than two thousand members attended. Zhang Kechang, Xiao Qingshan, and Zhu Yinghua were publicly elected as the presidium, with Shi Jiuyuan serving as the recorder. The order of the meeting was extremely [orderly]. The presidium reported on the purpose of the meeting and union affairs, leading to the discussion and resolution of several important motions. (1) Regarding illegal organizations established under the guise of the Postal Workers' Union, all members of the union shall deny their legitimacy and strictly suppress them. It was resolved to pass the motion and notify the authorities. Hereafter, in addition to not accepting any communication from illegal organizations established under the name of this union, the main actors in illegal organizations shall be subject to the most severe punishment according to postal regulations. (2) To expel labor traitors such as Xing Rongzhao, Sun Hanliang, Tan Changde, and Zhao Liancheng, who are disrupting the Postal Workers' Union. It was resolved that, based on the resolution of the delegates' conference, the Executive and Supervisory Committee shall be responsible for immediately expelling these labor traitors. All members of the union, united in hatred, will never work with these labor traitors and demand that the authorities not allow these labor traitors to work in the bureau. (3) Regarding how the union should respond to the actions of a certain department's (secret) authorities, who have insulted laborers, disrupted the labor movement, damaged the postal service, behaved perversely, acted basely, bought off labor traitors, and disrupted the union, resulting in obvious crimes. It was resolved that (a) the Executive Committee shall take the most effective methods and means to deal with it when necessary; (b) the facts shall be announced to inform all sectors of society that the disruption by labor traitors is by no means an internal dispute of the union, but a vile plan by a certain department's authorities to sabotage the entire postal service; (c) the National Postal Workers' General Union shall be petitioned to issue a circular to postal workers' unions in various regions to take unified action. (4) To request the Postal Economic System Research Committee to convene a meeting as soon as possible and implement a plan to consolidate the foundation of the postal service. It was resolved to pass the motion and instruct the Executive Committee to handle it. (5) To convene the 10th Representatives' Conference of the union as soon as possible to elect the 10th Executive and Supervisory Committee. It was resolved to pass the motion and instruct the Executive Committee to handle it as soon as possible. (6) To have Zou Zhong issue a declaration of the conference. It was resolved to pass other important motions. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. In addition, on the morning of the 20th at 10:00 AM, more than ten members of the union's Executive and Supervisory Committee went to the Postal General Bureau to petition Director Huang Naishu, requesting three points: (1) The General Bureau hastily accepted letters from the so-called "Three-Five Labor Traitors," who had privately established an illegal "Joint Office," and instructed the Shanghai Bureau to investigate. This is procedurally inappropriate and suggests collusion with labor traitors. It is requested that this be clarified and corrected. (2) Xing Rongzhao and nine others who have already been expelled from the union should be promptly removed from the Postal Bureau. (3) Regarding the few individuals who participated in the closed-down illegal organization, since they have violated national law, please clarify how the Bureau should punish them according to postal regulations. At that time, Director Huang promised that, regarding the first point, he would issue a clear order to the Shanghai Bureau to immediately cancel the previous instruction and declare that hereafter, the Bureau would not accept any illegal organization established under the name of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union. This order was personally drafted by the Director in front of the union representatives at 10:00 AM this morning and handed over to the secretary for issuance. As for items (2) and (3), to avoid future disputes in the postal service, Director Huang sincerely expressed to the union representatives that he would consider a compromise solution, that is, to transfer the main elements of the illegal organization away from Shanghai first, but for the sake of prudence, he would simultaneously send a telegram to the ministry for instructions. It was heard that when the Director's reception room was discussing the matter yesterday morning, hundreds of union members also went to the outside of the Director's office to await a reply. This morning, when negotiations continued in the Director's office, Mr. Chen Kecheng, secretary of the municipal government, was also present and expressed sympathy for this compromise solution.</p>

<h3 id="e136">"Elopement" Actress Sues for Loss of Virginity <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Virginity Lost Before Age Sixteen</p>
<p>Sues in Court Seeking $50,000 in Damages</p>
<p>Defendant Gu Baosen is an Architect</p>
<p>Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday, Arrest Warrant to be Issued</p>
<p>Tan Ying, a female actress of the Lianhua Film Company who plays the lead role in the elopement film directed by Du Yu, has been praised by critics as a rising star in the film industry. Unexpectedly, she has experienced a similar situation as in the elopement film, which can be described as coincidental. Tan Ying, along with her mother Tan Wang, hired lawyers Zhang Chongding and Xu Qinpu and, as residents of No. 5, Yude Alley, East Tangjia Lane, filed a criminal self-accusation with the local court against Gu Baolin, also known as Gu Xiaochun, an architect, accusing him of seducing a young girl. The self-accusation stated that he seduced a girl under the age of sixteen and requested legal punishment, with accompanying civil proceedings. The self-accuser and the defendant were previously landlord and tenant and lived together for two years, so they knew each other. The defendant often visited the self-accuser's residence and, seeing that the self-accuser's daughter, Da Bao, also known as Tan Ying, had grown up and was attractive, developed covetous thoughts and seduced her in every possible way. The self-accuser's daughter, lacking in knowledge, was seduced and, on April 5 of this year, designed to seduce her and have physical relations. Moreover, the defendant's boldness was as great as the sky, and he actually lured the self-accuser's daughter to his home in Tangjia Lane. The self-accuser's daughter, seeing that the defendant already had a wife, Tang Jianchun, realized she had been deceived and was in great pain. The defendant comforted her, saying he would definitely divorce Tang. This was delayed until late May, when he produced a divorce certificate</p>
<p>and a Shen Bao advertisement. The self-accuser's daughter realized that Tang was still at Gu's home and that the divorce was actually a farce, nothing more than a means to deceive her into marriage. She suddenly woke up and returned to the self-accuser to cry and tell the truth. The self-accuser was extremely angry and, accompanied by her daughter, went to the defendant's residence to negotiate. The defendant spoke sweet words, insisting that he sincerely wanted to marry the self-accuser's daughter and that the divorce from Tang was real. He even voluntarily wrote a note stating that if any disputes arose with the Tang family in the future, he would be willing to pay $50,000 (this was presented for inspection at the trial). The self-accuser realized that this matter could not be resolved through words and accepted the note written by the defendant and took her daughter home. After questioning, it was learned that the defendant had also engaged in intimidation, saying that if she did not agree to marry him, he would stab her to death with a knife. Thinking that the self-accuser's daughter, Tan Ying, also known as Da Bao, is habitually said to be seventeen years old, born on April 22 of the lunar calendar, and legally deducting the age, she is still under sixteen years old. Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code stipulates that sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen is considered rape. The defendant's seduction of the self-accuser's daughter actually began on April 5, before her sixteenth birthday. According to law, she was only fifteen years old. The defendant took advantage of a weak girl whose knowledge had not reached adulthood and whose body had not fully developed, using wealth and power to seduce her into marriage in order to achieve his lascivious purpose, causing the virgin's chastity to be trampled upon. This is tolerable, what is not tolerable? Therefore, in accordance with Article 337 and Paragraph 2 of the same article of the Criminal Procedure Law, a self-accusation is filed, requesting the court to punish the defendant with the appropriate crime according to Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the self-accuser's daughter suffered physical and mental pain as a result of this misfortune and is bound by social traditions and her own concept of chastity, making it impossible for her to remarry. The cost of living and irreparable damage she has suffered should be compensated by the defendant. Moreover, the self-accuser's daughter works as an actress at the Lianhua Film Company, earning a monthly salary of $120, as evidenced by a contract. Calculated over thirty years, this amounts to $43,000. Therefore, in the accompanying civil proceedings, it is requested that the court order compensation for a total of $50,000, which is fair and convenient, etc. This case was heard yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by Judge Shi in the first courtroom. Tan Wang and Tan Ying testified to the same facts as above. The judge instructed that the defendant, Gu Baosen, also known as Gu Xiaochun, refused to accept the subpoena. Asked what the self-accusers requested, lawyers Zhang and Gu stated that the defendant was intentionally evading and requested an arrest warrant. The judge approved this and ordered the defendant to be arrested and brought to court for further investigation before adjourning.</p>
<h3 id="e137">A Couple Commits Suicide in a Hotel <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Found Lifeless</p>
<p>A Couple Lying Side by Side, Stiff</p>
<p>A Long Suicide Note</p>
<p>Incomprehensible Poems on the Wall</p>
<p>A hotel at No. 348, Tianjin Road, had a male and female guest check in on the evening of March 19, booking room 412. The man claimed his name was Lü Zhongyi, 26 years old, a merchant. The woman was about the same age, spoke with a Suzhou accent, and both came from Hangzhou. The two kept to themselves, but their behavior suggested a close relationship. Around noon the day before, they called for a tea boy to buy a pack of chewing gum. About two hours later, they ordered a plate of curry chicken rice. At that time, they told the waiter that they would continue to rent the room. After the two finished eating, they went out together and only returned in the evening. After entering the room, they closed the door tightly, and there was no sound. Until yesterday afternoon, the tea boys had cleaned all the rooms on the fourth floor, except for room 412, which remained silent. It was already 12:30 PM, so the foreman called out the guest's name outside the room, but there was no response after a long time. So he used a key to open the door, only to see the curtains drawn, and the room was unusually dim. He turned on the light and saw a couple lying side by side on the bed, stiff and lifeless. The accounting room was immediately notified, and the Old Gate Police Station was contacted to send detectives to investigate. The two were then taken to Renji Hospital, where they were confirmed to have died from poisoning and were transferred to the morgue to await inspection by the court. The deceased left a suicide note on the table, which was lengthy and extensive, but unfortunately, the writing was not very coherent. It described the deceased's background and the reasons for their despondency. Before taking their lives, the two also wrote several short sentences on the wall, which are recorded as follows: "Dying for the country is not resolute, I hope you don't resent my death, I am fortunate. I am a person full of hatred in this world, this man is especially affectionate to me, not sparing a feather. You are in the misty mountain, I hope people leave, I will be a wave-cresting subject in the flood. You are going to death, do you know? After you, there will be no affection, in fact, I am also going to death, do you know?" These lines are like poetry but not poetry. A photo of the man and woman together was also found in the room, along with the words "Nantong Jiangsu Bank," indicating that the man and woman died for love.</p>

<p>Women's Association Propagandist</p>
<p>Accuses Partner of Fraud and Seduction</p>
<p>Xu Xiuying, a 22-year-old woman from Hangzhou, resides at No. 143, Donggui Alley, Yuanfang Road. She used to be a propagandist for the Women's Association. In the spring of 1930, she met Yu Genfa, a native of Wuxi, who lived at No. 117, Sanyuli, Wuzhou Road. After Xu met Yu, they began cohabitating. In the winter of last year, she gave birth to a son. Recently, Yu suddenly abandoned her, so she filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing him of fraud and seduction. The reasons stated in the complaint are as follows: Two years ago, through an introduction, she discussed becoming husband and wife with Yu. Yu, under the pretext that he was requesting permission from his parents, delayed the wedding date. At that time, she was young and ignorant and was first seduced into having sexual relations. Then, she rented a house and cohabitated with him. In November of last year, she gave birth to a son. When the baby was a month old, Yu's mother and others personally invited relatives and friends to a banquet. Yu's mother passed away on April 15 of this year, and she intended to take her son to the funeral to fulfill her filial duty. However, Yu dissuaded her from going. Later, she found out that Yu already had a wife. Upon learning the truth, her heart was consumed by grief. However, considering that what's done is done, what could she do? She only hoped that she and her son would have a livelihood in the future. Therefore, she repeatedly sent letters through a lawyer and applied to the court for mediation, requesting the determination of alimony and the confirmation of the child's status. However, after more than a month, there was no reply. Therefore, she filed a self-accusation, etc. This case was heard once by Judge Feng Shide, but because the defendant did not appear, the hearing was changed to yesterday. First, the plaintiff testified as described above, and then the defendant was questioned. The defendant stated that he was very willing to provide for her living expenses, but the plaintiff's parents smoked opium and had enormous daily expenses. The defendant himself had no occupation before, and his finances were also very difficult after his mother's death, so he was unable to support her parents, etc. Judge Feng advised Xu Xiuying, saying that if you want Yu Genfa to provide alimony, you can file a lawsuit in the civil court. If you want to charge him with the crime of abduction, since you previously cohabitated, once the criminal sentence is confirmed, the relationship will be further broken, which will not be beneficial to you. Xiuying insisted on filing a criminal lawsuit, so the two sides were instructed to begin their arguments, and a date was set for sentencing.</p>

<p>Large Quantity of Opium Worth Thousands</p>
<p>Four Main Culprits Arrested Simultaneously</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession Police Department strictly prohibited gambling and opium, the local security has been slightly improved. Unexpectedly, recently, a Buddhist monk named Tan Yuelai from Guangdong and others secretly set up opium trafficking rings on North Sichuan Road. The addresses were very secretive. Recently, Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the General Police Station, made every effort to investigate and finally learned that a large amount of opium was hidden at No. 690, No. 714, and No. 706, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, which were interconnected. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he reported to Western Inspector Pan Gensi and, together with detectives Zhang Shaoqing, Ding Yugao, and others, drove an armed police car and secretly went to the location. The main culprits, Tan Yuelai, Wang Zhen, Li Pei, and Liang Zong, all from Guangdong, were arrested on the spot. More than 1,300 taels of opium, more than 700 taels of opium paste, four sets of opium paraphernalia, and more than 200 ledgers of sales records were seized and taken away in a red car. It is scheduled to be sent to the court today for severe punishment. It is also heard that the criminals had a very clever design. Their method was to pay money at one location, get a certificate at the second location, and get opium at the third location. Their ingenuity can be called first-class. Unexpectedly, the net of heaven is vast, and they were caught by the Narcotics Division. It can truly be said that the net has wide meshes, but it lets nothing slip through.</p>

<h3 id="e141">The Truth About the Dutch Ship Fire <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Losses Amount to $300,000</p>
<p>Fire Caused by Collision of Sulfur</p>
<p>The incident of the Dutch cargo ship Seroskerk, managed by the Java Shipping Company of this port, accidentally catching fire has been reported in this newspaper. The truth about the fire and the amount of loss are now further investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Moving Sulfur Causes Disaster: The ship was loaded with more than 5,000 tons of cargo from various ports in the Netherlands and Germany. The third hold contained 50 pieces of sulfur, which were loaded into the hold as military supplies. This sulfur is most likely to cause accidents. Excessive dryness or humidity can easily cause explosions. When the coolies were unloading the sulfur, one package was standing upright on top of the other sulfur packages. The foreign officer supervising the unloading of the cargo was afraid that it would fall and collide, causing a fire, so he went to support it and laid it horizontally on the cargo. Unexpectedly, due to a moment of carelessness, the package of sulfur collided violently with a bag below, causing a loud bang, sparks flying, and black smoke rising. Fortunately, the workers quickly escaped and were not harmed. The fire broke out in an instant, and the flames were extremely fierce. The shipowner was notified and immediately ordered the third hold where the fire broke out to be sealed off quickly to prevent the flames from spreading out.</p>
<p>Cargo in Three Holds Completely Destroyed: Fire trucks from the dock and fireboats from the Customs arrived. The shipowner immediately ordered the hold to be opened to allow water to be sprayed to extinguish the fire. Unexpectedly, when the hold was opened, water overflowed and directly penetrated the fourth hold, burning the cargo it encountered. The shipowner closed the fourth hold again. When the fourth hold was opened, the fire penetrated the fifth hold. As a result, the man-made silk, fertilizer, hardware, paper, sulfur, etc. that were carried were all reduced to ashes. The cargo that was not burned was also soaked in water. After six and a half hours, the fire was finally extinguished. The total cargo loss is at least more than $200,000.</p>
<p>Unloading the Soaked Cargo to Inspect the Damage: Yesterday, the company ordered the shipowner to pump out the accumulated water from the third, fourth, and fifth holds. All the remaining embers and water-soaked cargo were ordered to be stored on the Blue Funnel Wharf. On the one hand, customers were notified, and on the other hand, a public surveyor, Ellis, was invited to inspect the losses and prepare to auction off the water-soaked cargo. Currently, the water is being drained first. All the cargo from Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and Japan that was not burned on the ship will be transferred to other ships.</p>
<p>Ship Body to Be Overhauled in the Factory: After the great fire in the third, fourth, and fifth holds, the structural integrity of the ship was completely destroyed and could no longer be used. Now, after unloading the cargo, the ship will be towed to the Ruirong Shipyard for a major overhaul. The three hatchways were burned, and the repair costs will also be 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The ship was originally scheduled to go to North China and Japan today, but it will no longer be sailing there. It will take at least two weeks to leave the dock and set sail. All the losses of cargo and the ship's body in this fire are covered by insurance, and the insurance company will be responsible for all compensation.</p>

<p>Declines All Social Engagements</p>
<p>Proceeds Directly to Marseille</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin and his brother Sydney Chaplin, both comedic stars of the American film industry, are renowned on the silver screen and famous throughout the world. The two brothers have come to the Far East to tour and study theater and music. Charlie Chaplin has finished his tour of Japan and originally planned to return to the United States by ship. However, because the Pacific Ocean was too rough, he changed his route to Europe via the Suez Canal and then across the Atlantic Ocean back to Hollywood in the United States. Charlie, along with Edward Angue, a member of the film industry, and Laning Shimei, a violin expert, arrived in Shanghai from Kobe, Japan, on the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Terukuni Maru. When they arrived at the port, many reporters came to the ship to take pictures and talk to them. Mr. Charlie Chaplin declined all social engagements and did not respond to the representatives sent by various cinemas in Shanghai to welcome him. Later, he went ashore alone for a short tour and then returned to the original ship. This trip proceeds directly to Marseille, France, but he will also have to go ashore in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Lake Society Calls on All Sectors to Promote Domestic Silk <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Lake Society Committee sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation, and various domestic goods organizations yesterday to promote domestic silk. We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from our society member Gao Weisong, the silk produced in our Lake area has always been a major commodity, on which the nation's tax revenue and the people's livelihood mutually depend. In recent years, imported goods have flooded the market, and silk trade in various countries has risen like a storm, resulting in a sharp decline in the sales of our silk, which has always been known for its natural wealth, compared to the past. This is an unprecedented phenomenon. The distant cause of this is that we adhere to old methods and do not know how to improve. Last year's silk cocoons have not been cleared, and this year's new products are accumulating again. Although we are fortunate to have gentlemen in Shanghai discussing methods to promote the new and get rid of the old and request government subsidies, the industry is benefiting from this great favor, like receiving timely rain, but relying on temporary relief is not a fundamental solution. The society member, aware of this crisis, is deeply concerned and is seeking a remedy to save the desperate situation. After searching day and night, he has somewhat achieved his wish. He has now invented yarn silks such as Xishi Ge. This kind of material is specially selected from top-quality factories and employs famous masters to process and weave it densely, making it comparable to imported goods. This is just the beginning of improving silk, and it is by no means comparable to those who use it as a pretext for speculation. This ambition and this heart can be testified by heaven and earth. However, at the beginning of the invention, sponsorship is needed to show people's faith and to promote it. We specially rely on your esteemed committee, which is the mouthpiece of our hometown and has a well-deserved reputation, and dare to ask you to promote it, etc., and send a sample of the silk. We have found that this type of silk is of excellent quality and has a novel pattern, without any inferior silk or artificial silk mixed in. The price is also very modest in order to resist foreign goods, which is very suitable. At this time, when Shanghai is in urgent need of revival, all Chinese people have the duty to protect their rights and interests. With this improved silk, we should do our best to promote it. We have always admired your association's enthusiasm for patriotism and its widespread reputation. We have specially sent a sample of the silk for your reference and hope that you will vigorously promote its use in order to expand sales and save our rights and interests. We remain in hopeful anticipation. Sincerely, the Lake Society Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Police Tear Down Store Slogans <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Citizens' Federation Negotiates with the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of a Chinese police officer from the Putuo Road Police Station breaking into a store, forcibly tearing down slogans, then driving all the store employees into the police station, and then a Western police officer intimidating them, the Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council for negotiation yesterday. We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from the Fourth District Branch of our association, Chen Shusheng, the manager of Xiangtai Silver Shop, reported to the association that yesterday at 6:00 PM, a Chinese police officer from the Putuo Road Police Station suddenly came to the store, forcibly tore down the slogans of various Shanghai organizations commemorating the fallen soldiers that were posted inside the silver cabinet, and then beat the apprentice Yu Miaofa, behaving lawlessly and insulting all the colleagues in the store. He was taken to the police station, where Western police officer No. 227 forcibly intimidated him with strong words and various unreasonable actions. Therefore, we are reporting this to your esteemed council and requesting immediate relief, etc. According to this, the slogans posted by Xiangtai were received from your esteemed council and should be distributed to various stores to be posted to promote the spirit of patriotism and realize the efforts of publicity, with no other intention. The police officer's insult is a special report to your council, requesting that you quickly forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council to argue on the basis of reason, for the sake of public convenience, etc., and arrive at the association. Inquiring into the matter of intruding into the store and tearing down the slogans, the police behavior has exceeded the scope of police affairs. Furthermore, taking all the staff of the store to the police station and the Western police officer No. 227 intimidating them is even more inappropriate. What is the purpose of the slogans commemorating the fallen soldiers? Your council will surely understand after thinking calmly. According to the aforementioned letter, we are hereby writing to request that your council correct this mistake and treat the Xiangtai Silver Shop with due respect. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Principal Offender in the Murder of Huang Baoshan</p>
<p>Huang Baoshan, who operated a waste management business on Xiangyan Bridge Road in Hujiaqiao, was shot and killed a few years ago due to business jealousy. Following the incident, several people were apprehended and sentenced to lengthy prison terms or life imprisonment. The victim's family later apprehended Dai Ruzhao, a fellow villager who had previously worked as a detective in the Public Security Bureau, identifying him as the mastermind behind the crime. After the police station transferred him to the local court for review of previous case files, it was confirmed that Dai was indeed the principal offender and was wanted. Following the public prosecution, Judge Shen conducted multiple interrogations and debates. Yesterday, the proposal was submitted and Dai Ruzhao was sentenced to death for premeditated murder, and ordered to pay the victim's family, Wang Ji-shi, 3,650 yuan in consolation money and 300 yuan in damages. Dai Ruzhao protested the verdict, claiming innocence. The court ordered him to be taken down and held in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Due to a fire at No. 145 Aierkaoke Road, the homeowner hired plasterers Ye Sanmao and Zhang Hesheng to repair the remaining walls. The walls suddenly collapsed, severely injuring Ye and Zhang. They were rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Zhang died from his injuries, and Ye also died last night from his injuries. The bodies were sent to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Guo and forensic doctor Wei were dispatched by the First Special District Local Court to the center to examine the bodies. After confirming the cause of death, Wang Rongfu was summoned for questioning. He testified, "I was working in the same area that day, about 20 feet away from the deceased Zhang and Ye. Suddenly, I heard the sound of the wall collapsing, and the two of them were already buried in the rubble." The examination concluded that both Zhang Hesheng and Ye Sanmao died from injuries sustained before death due to being crushed. Zhang's body was handed over to his sister, Sun Zhang-shi, and Ye's body was handed over to his wife, Ye Gu-shi, to be taken back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Teenager Attempts Suicide by Poisoning Over Marriage Arrangement <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>At the Oriental Hotel near Xiaodongmen in Nanshi, a lone young man, wearing a blue-striped long gown, a felt hat, floral socks, and wool shoes, arrived at around 10:00 PM on the 19th of this month. He identified himself as Zhou Guxiong, 19 years old, from Ningbo. The hotel staff led him upstairs and opened room 33. Zhou entered the room to sleep. However, at 10:00 AM on the 20th, the guest had not yet gotten up. The waiter called out several times but received no response, nor did he hear any movement from inside the room, which seemed strange. He then went to peek through the cracks in the wall of the adjacent room and saw the guest lying horizontally in bed, with the bedding in disarray and a pale face. Realizing something was wrong, the waiter immediately reported to the front desk, and they managed to pry open the door to the room. Upon inspection, they found several pieces of paper resembling opium wrappers on the floor, indicating a suicide attempt by poisoning. The hotel manager, Chu Lianke, reported the incident to the Second Precinct of the First District Public Security Bureau. The precinct chief, Bao Bingchen, dispatched police officer Gong Weichuan to investigate. It turned out that the hotel had already sent the poisoned guest, Zhou Guxiong, to the Nanshi Public Hospital for treatment. After examination by Dr. Jiang Zhenxun, it was determined that the poisoning was too severe and his life was in danger. According to the doctor, the person was not actually named Zhou. A relative surnamed He came to visit and revealed that his real name was He Zigui, 18 years old, residing on Xinzha Road and working at a customs brokerage in Shanghai. The reason for the suicide was his mother's arrangement of his marriage. It is said that the poison he took was sleeping pill powder.</p>

After receiving the report, Officer Guo immediately dispatched police officer Wang Jixuan and others to the address.

<p>Beware of Swindlers</p>
<p>Recently, a Chinese man in his late twenties or early thirties, about five feet seven inches tall, of medium build, with a slightly dark and round face, large and round eyes, short hair, wearing a blue cloth short jacket and trousers, and a checkered duckbill cap, has been swindling people out of their telephones. He speaks fluent English and targets residential and commercial establishments. His methods are particularly innovative. The swindler often claims to be an employee of the telephone company and inspects telephones under the pretext of inspection. After the inspection, he claims that the telephone needs repair, dismantles various components, takes them away, and says that he will return to reinstall them soon. However, he disappears like a yellow crane, and neither he nor the telephone are ever seen again. When questioned, the swindler produces a paper certificate with his photo and the number 107, so people do not suspect him. Many people have been fooled recently.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Ministry of Education Orders Jiangsu Education Department to Temporarily Suspend Changing Names of Experimental Schools <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department decided to convert seven schools, including Zhenjiang Middle School, into normal schools, stop enrolling ordinary students from this semester, and rename the seven experimental primary schools, including Zhenjiang Experimental Primary School, as affiliated primary schools. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Representatives of teachers and staff from Jiangsu Experimental Primary School, including Yu Gancheng, opposed changing the experimental primary schools to affiliated schools and submitted their opinions to the Ministry of Education, requesting them to instruct the Jiangsu Education Department to withdraw the order to change the names and maintain the original experimental primary school system. After receiving the submission, the Ministry of Education, believing that the points raised were not without reason, issued an instruction to the Jiangsu Education Department yesterday (June 20) stating: "Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary School Teachers and Staff Representatives, including Yu Gancheng, submitted a report to the Ministry stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary Schools have been changed for five years. At the beginning of the change, the significance was extremely important. Now, the Jiangsu Education Department is abolishing a part of it and changing it to an affiliated name. The colleagues of the Vocational School held a meeting in Zhenjiang on the 12th of this month and unanimously decided to request the Jiangsu Education Department to withdraw the order and to request Your Excellency to instruct to maintain the original experimental primary school system. According to the presentation, there are currently a total of fifteen Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary Schools. Now, because seven middle schools will be converted into completely independent normal schools within two years, the seven experimental primary schools will be changed to affiliated primary schools of the middle schools in advance. Firstly, it is not necessary to change the name of the primary schools before the normal schools become independent. Secondly, after two years, they will be changed to affiliated primary schools of a certain normal school, and the names will be changed frequently. Thirdly, for the same primary school, those that provide practice for normal school students are called affiliated primary schools, while those that do not provide practice for normal school students are called experimental primary schools. The names are ambiguous, and the system is inconsistent. After investigation, the points raised are not without reason. It seems necessary to reconsider the entire plan and temporarily suspend the renaming. However, since it concerns local education, the department should report the handling process and its opinions for record."</p>

<p>Beiping, June 21 (Telegraph) Eleven representatives of primary and secondary school teachers and staff in Beiping, including Ge Jiou, visited Song Ziwen this morning to inquire about the Beiping educational subsidy.

<h3 id="e163">Representatives of Jinan University Faculty and Staff Arrive in Beijing to Demand Overdue Salaries <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>·Minister Zhu's Reply·</p>
<p>Full Salaries to be Paid from July</p>
<p>Back Pay Must Await Entire Plan</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 20th, five representatives of the faculty and staff of Jinan University, Xie Xunchu, Yu Jitai, Chen Kemei, Gu Ming, and Zhang Feng, arrived at the Ministry of Education to demand overdue salaries. Zhu Jiaju met with them. The representatives requested three points: (1) to pay the full three months of overdue salaries for November, December, and January; (2) to make up the 60% of salaries for February, March, and April (40% has been paid), and 50% of salaries for May and June; and (3) to pay the faculty and staff salaries in full from now on. Zhu replied that from July onwards, the funds for all national schools would be allocated in full. After the funds were allocated in full, the Ministry of Education would negotiate a repayment plan with the Ministry of Finance for the overdue funds. The existing 30% and 50% of funds were not intended to write off the unpaid funds. The Ministry of Education only stated that the receipt of a certain percentage of funds was to retain the possibility of demanding the remaining unpaid funds. However, this method was a predetermined arrangement by the government as a whole, and it was not aimed at education funds alone. The Ministry of Education did not seem to be in a position to propose a separate compensation plan, etc. The representatives expressed only partial satisfaction with what Zhu said and would report back to the entire faculty and staff at the school for discussion on further salary demands. It is heard that the representatives will go to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the 21st to continue their petition.</p>
<p>Jinan University Faculty's Declaration to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance Demanding Salaries Since the professors and others at Jinan University began attending classes in March of this year, enduring pain and suffering, they have proposed salary demands at two dinners in April and early May. At that time, they all believed that since foreign disasters were raging and military needs were urgent, those who held educational positions should be concerned about the country and have public-minded loyalty. Therefore, they repeatedly stopped discussing this matter. However, they still hoped that as time passed and the situation changed, the ruling officials would definitely understand the difficulties of the people and issue their life-sustaining salaries in advance, without having to demand them. However, under the leadership of "long-term resistance, the whole plan," we resist every day but retreat every day, and we negotiate every day but agreements are made. Classes have been held for four months, and summer vacation is just around the corner, but the salary that we need and cherish is nowhere to be found. It is tolerable to have the salaries for life-sustaining teaching positions delayed and ignored, but it is intolerable! Resistance is long-term, and we do not know when it will end. Planning is holistic, but local instability is already causing great turmoil. After repeated forbearance and deliberation, we were forced to convene our colleagues and held a salary demand meeting at the First Academy of our school on Hede Road at 4:00 PM on June 15 to discuss effective methods. In the end, we all agreed to elect representatives to draft a report and set out for Beijing on the 19th of the month to demand overdue salaries from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance. In the report, the main requests were: (1) Please pay the full amount of the three months of overdue salaries for November, December, and January of last year. (2) Please pay the deducted percentage of salaries for the four months of February, March, April, and May of this year. (3) Please pay the full amount of school funds from June onwards. (4) Please issue the temporary funds of 230,000 yuan that were previously approved and allocated. The report also stated clearly, "We hope that the government will accommodate the above four items. If there is no satisfactory response and sincere acceptance, we will have no choice but to take concerted action within the scope permitted by the school regulations to arouse the sympathy of the national education community and to promote the government's attention." Now that the representatives are on their way, the government's sincerity is at stake, and the future of education depends on this. We hope that the representatives will work hard and ask for the assistance of the national education community. This declaration is hereby made for your public consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Annual Meeting of Chinese Economic Society to Discuss National Crisis Economic Issues <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>To be Held in Hangzhou in September</p>
<p>With the national crisis intensifying and foreign insults becoming more urgent, economic issues are of utmost importance. The Chinese Economic Society, recognizing this, plans to gather experts at this year's annual meeting to discuss national crisis economic issues. It has been decided to hold the meeting in Hangzhou in September. The original letter to the members is recorded below:</p>
<p>Dear Sir, The Society intends to discuss the economic problems of the national crisis at this year's annual meeting. The discussion time is planned to be limited to four hours each time. First, three or four people will be responsible for reading papers and expressing opinions in turn (each limited to forty minutes), and then three or four people will be responsible for commenting (each limited to ten minutes), in order to stimulate the spirit of debate and achieve the effect of mutual learning. The annual meeting is scheduled to be held in Hangzhou in September. Please identify all paper and comment topics before June 6 of this year and inform us in advance so that the Paper Committee can collect, arrange, and consult again to assign responsibilities. Enclosed is a draft outline of the economic problems of the national crisis to be discussed at the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society for your reference. Please provide further details and suggestions for discussion. We would be very grateful. The draft outline of the national economic crisis to be discussed at the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society is attached. The first discussion will address the relationship between China's national crisis and the world economy. The second discussion will address the economic problems in the national crisis and their solutions (note that the word "various" can be added above the economy).

<p>Thirty-three</p>
<p>I said: "Mr. Zhu wants me to be a senior disciple, which I am quite willing to do. But it's just that I will teach others what I know, and learn from others what I don't know. It doesn't seem necessary to distinguish between senior and junior. As for the master's chair, please, sir, sit down honestly and without ceremony, there's no need to decline."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: "Broadly speaking, not only are there no senior or junior disciples, but even the distinction between master and disciple cannot be clearly drawn. Take me for example. I can be your master in some things, but I need to be your disciple in others. Not to mention anything else, just take the matter of striking the bell, I should be apprenticed to you. Not only should I apprentice to you, there are few people in the world who wouldn't need to apprentice to you."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's words struck a chord with me. Which young person doesn't like to hear compliments? I knew that Mr. Zhu certainly wasn't trying to plant seeds of pride in my heart. He was just using a simple example to prove that there are no strict boundaries between teacher and student. However, I must be careful not to let people's compliments about the small matter of striking the bell lead me to actually put on the airs of a master. Even if I become a master in the future, I must still be willing to humbly be a student, only then will there be hope for progress. I agree with Mr. Zhu's idea of running a school like Han Xin commanding troops, the more the better. But I don't quite agree with recruiting one-year-old infants. In the end, I had to honestly raise my concerns: "Sir, you should reconsider recruiting infants. You see, after these infants arrive, crying, being held, being hungry, urinating, defecating all day long, you'll have to take care of everything yourself, how can you manage? If you ask the senior disciples to help, who would be willing?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: "You don't have to worry about that, I have ready-made disciples. These disciples are each infant's own mother. By teaching each mother, we are teaching each infant." I said: "This also has its difficulties. The customs in our village are not enlightened. Sir, how can you, a man, properly instruct women? Once there is suspicion of impropriety, it won't be a small matter."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: "It's always acceptable for women to teach women, right? I think Old Mrs. Song is quite good. If she is willing to come out and lead, are there still problems? There shouldn't be any gossip if we help her, right?" I said: "That's safer. But why is Sir in such a hurry to start with infant education?" Mr. Zhu said: "If a child's emotions, habits, and tendencies are not properly cultivated before the age of six, it will be difficult to change them in the future. For example, fear of ghosts is a most unreasonable emotion, almost entirely created by women's rumors. And the result? Fear of ghosts when young, fear of ghosts forever. How important is education before the age of six! Therefore, to cultivate elementary school students, we must first cultivate kindergarten students, even more so, we must cultivate infants, that is, we must cultivate the mothers of infants, that is the fundamental approach. Wanting to run an elementary school well without paying attention to mother education is like trying to catch the moon in the water, how is it possible?"</p>

<p>The Education Society reports: The private Qunming Elementary School, opened by Yu Xueqian at No. 54 Dunhe Lane, Ladu Road, in the French Concession of this city, was accused to the Municipal Education Bureau of soliciting money illegally under the guise of running a school. After investigation by the Education Bureau, Yu Xueqian admitted that he had solicited donations to comfort the soldiers and aid the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. The Education Bureau reprimanded the school for its non-compliant fundraising procedures and ordered it not to solicit donations again, and to hand over the donated funds to the Bureau for transfer to the Social Bureau for wartime relief matters.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of university students in this city, recently because the National Labor University of this city was suddenly ordered to be closed by the Ministry of Education, specially petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to withdraw the order. The original text is recorded as follows: To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, the National Labor University is the only institution of higher learning for labor education in our country. It has been established for five years. Unfortunately, when the January 28th Incident occurred, the school was in the war zone. The Labor University, which was established with great difficulty these past five years, was destroyed by the violent Japanese. At this critical moment, how should the country try to maintain it, so that China's labor education can move towards a brighter future? Unexpectedly, your Yuan and Ministry have not come up with such a plan, and have consistently pursued a policy of destroying labor education. First, they stopped enrollment, then they disarmed and disbanded, and finally they openly ordered the closure, putting this lifeline for rescuing out-of-school youth across the country in dire straits. For the sake of the future of labor education and for the sake of poor, out-of-school youth across the country, our Federation firmly opposes it. We hereby urgently request that the order be withdrawn immediately to conform to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of promoting labor education.</p>

<p>In order to allow young people to make up for their studies and elementary school teachers to further their education, Jianguo Middle School in this city has specially obtained approval from the Municipal Education Bureau to open a summer school. The subjects are divided into high school general courses, high school normal courses, and junior high school courses, with more than 20 types of courses. Classes are scheduled to start on July 1st, and the duration of study is two months. Students who pass the examination in each subject will be issued a certificate of completion. The brochure can be obtained from the school's temporary campus in Remi Lane, Ladu Road, or can be requested by mail. It is said that many people have been enthusiastically requesting brochures and registering in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Rumors of the Puppet State Participating in the World Games Have Not Been Approved <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>It is said that they initially requested to participate but were not approved by the conference.</p>
<p>Yu Xiwei and Liu Changchun recently issued statements in the Tianjin and Beijing newspapers regarding their attitudes.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much speculation and debate about the participation of the puppet Manchurian state in the World Games. According to sources on the other hand, there is no such thing at all, and it is entirely a propaganda effort by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Green-shirted officials did not accept it. The puppet state's participation in the conference is based on the precedent of the Philippines and India, but although India and the Philippines are under the flags of the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively, they all have legally recognized amateur sports associations that are recognized by the International Olympic Committee. The puppet state has neither been recognized by the League of Nations nor has a legally recognized sports organization that is recognized by the Olympic Committee, so it naturally does not have the qualifications to participate. It is said that there was indeed a telegram requesting to join sent to Green-shirted officials, but the Olympic Committee did not accept it.</p>
<p>Yu and Liu were unaware of the matter. As for the athletes sent by the puppet state, they were originally Yu Xiwei and Liu Changchun. Both of them were unaware of this matter, and the puppet state has not made any indication to Yu and Liu. It was only seen in the telegrams of the Japanese news agency. The two of them also felt strange about this matter and were baffled by it.</p>
<p>Statements from Yu and Liu. Liu Changchun moved to Beiping early when the Northeast fell, so the people of the country did not doubt him. Recently, Mr. Liu issued a statement in the Tianjin newspaper stating his own will, that even if the puppet state wanted to send him to participate, how could he willingly be a slave to a conquered country? Because Yu Xiwei is in the territory of the puppet state, people generally thought that he would be threatened by the puppet state to participate. Recently, it was heard that Yu sent a letter to a friend in Beiping, saying that he would go to Beiping in the next few days, and that the puppet state's sending him to the United States was entirely fictitious, and there was no danger. In short, the truth of this matter is unknown, but the statements of Yu and Liu may be credible. As for whether the Green-shirted officials approved or rejected the puppet state's participation, it remains to be seen. We will record it for now to see what happens later.</p>

<p>The deadline for selection and reporting is August 1st.</p>
<p>Proposals should be sent two weeks before the meeting.</p>
<p>The drafting committee for the plan and staff have been appointed.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st: The Ministry of Education has stipulated that the National Sports Conference will be held from August 16th to 20th. It has issued a notice to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, which will then forward it to provincial, municipal, and registered private universities, independent colleges, and sports schools, urging them to quickly select the members to be sent and report them before August 1st, and to send the proposals two weeks before the meeting for review and compilation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Ministry of Education sent letters to Yuan Dunli, Hao Gengsheng, and Wu Yunrui on the 20th, along with letters of appointment, officially appointing them as members of the drafting committee for the National Physical Education Implementation Plan. At the same time, the Ministry of Education ordered Guo Lianfeng to be the director-general of the National Sports Conference, and Gu Liangjie, Weng Zhida, and Huang Longxian to be the officers of the documentation section of the National Sports Conference, and Shi Wei, Zhang Yuanxun, and Tu Gang to be the officers of the reception section.</p>

<h3 id="e181">The "Eating the Party" Comrade in the Child's Mouth <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The effectiveness of the word "eat" is very broad. Doing what kind of business is called eating what kind of food: gambling stall owners hope to eat everything, socializers are only afraid of losing face; others, like students, after every exam, privately discuss who will definitely eat an A, who will definitely eat a B, eat a C, eat a D.</p>
<p>Eating religion is different from believing in religion. If you call someone who believes in religion "eating religion," that person is sure to object. Who would have thought that, in addition to "eating religion," there is now also the term "eating the Party." The person who created the term "eating religion" doesn't refer to faithful believers, but to those who use religion to beg for food. By analogy, all the characters who "eat the Party" are probably not faithful Party members, but are just using the Party to beg for food; I think that the Party must not have any characters who "eat the Party" in order to maintain the Party's dignity and remain unchanged over time.</p>
<p>A friend told me a new joke:</p>
<p>In a certain province, there was a faithful comrade named Jiang Mian. It is not certain whether these are the exact characters; anyway, it's just a joke, so let's just write two characters at random.</p>
<p>After Jiang Mian joined the political party, he worked hard for the Party, and was definitely not a person who relied on the Party for food. One day, Jiang Mian was passing through a small alley, when he heard the children inside shouting: "Jiang Mian, a comrade who eats the Party! Jiang Mian, a comrade who eats the Party!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, he couldn't help but feel angry. He was a faithful comrade, what kind of kids! How dare they call him by name and call him a comrade who eats the Party!</p>
<p>He angrily ran inside, intending to negotiate with those kids; but, after investigating, he couldn't help but laugh; it turned out that the kids were reading the Analects, and what they were reading was: "Que dang tong zi jiang ming! Que dang tong zi jiang ming!" (A boy from Que dang was delivering a message!)</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Bamboo Hat of the Nineteenth Route Army <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Eternal Remembrance</p>
<p>This time, the bamboo hat of the Nineteenth Route Army not only gave the Japanese a permanent and profound understanding, but also gave the people of the world an understanding. The Japanese have recently published a book called "Photographs of the Nineteenth Route Army," which also uses a bamboo hat as an advertisement, which shows that after receiving a great lesson from the Nineteenth Route Army, they firmly recognized this bamboo hat. Perhaps later they will feel that the bamboo hat is a thing to be feared, hated, and respected!</p>
<p>Many foreigners think that the bamboo hat is a specially made military hat of the Nineteenth Route Army, thinking that it can also protect against bullets like foreign steel helmets. Even many Chinese people have the same view. In fact, this kind of bamboo hat is a very popular hat among farmers in Guangdong, especially farmers in Zhongshan County. Men and women wear it when they go out, whether it is sunny or rainy. They call it a "copper drum hat." Each hat costs only twenty or thirty cents. It can protect against the sun and also shelter from the rain. It is made of two layers of fine bamboo, with palm leaves sandwiched in between. After buying a hat, most farmers write their names on it, and then spend three or five cents to add a layer of cooked tung oil, which makes it brighter and more durable. (There are people in the market who specialize in carrying loads of cooked tung oil, making a living by oiling hats for people.) Two straps are added to the inner edge of the hat. When worn, the straps are tightened so that the wind won't blow it off. When not in use, the straps are loosened and hung on the back, which does not hinder work at all. It is cheap, durable, and serves multiple purposes, and can be regarded as a blessing for farmers in Guangdong. The Nineteenth Route Army likes to use it, probably because they are mostly from Guangdong, and also because it is a practical thing. Wearing it on the heads of hardworking farmers can give them comfort, and wearing it on the heads of patriotic soldiers can give the enemy a great lesson and enhance our international status. Bamboo hat! We will always love you! (No remuneration received)</p>
<h3 id="e183">Overseas Chinese Rarely Get to Raise Their Eyebrows <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Stone</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a friend studying in the United States, saying that since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, our army's good news has been constantly transmitted to the United States. Major and minor newspapers across the country have used large-print headlines to report the news of the Chinese army resisting the enemy. Not to mention that our overseas Chinese compatriots in the United States are all elated, even the just people of the United States are all inspired and energized, praising the Eastern Sleeping Lion for stretching and awakening. One evening, my friend gathered dozens of friends and took a seat in a cafe to discuss supporting the military affairs of resisting Japan in Shanghai. A novelist at the next table learned that these dozens of overseas Chinese were discussing national salvation and donations, and suddenly requested to give a brief speech. My friend allowed it. The novelist immediately stood up and spoke, with many encouraging words. Among them, there were several sentences that said: If we see two people fighting in the street, we must come out and mediate, because if two strong people fight, one of them will definitely be injured. Once one is injured, they will definitely seek revenge in the future, so there will inevitably be no day of peace. If a strong person fights a weak person, and the strong person violently beats the weak person, and the weak person does not resist, then the strong person can be allowed to beat the weak person to death, so there will be no fear of future troubles. Japan occupies Northeast China, and China retreats without resistance, which is a fight between the strong and the weak. Today, the Japanese army invades Shanghai, and the Chinese army resists with all its strength, which is a fight between two strong people. We, the people of the United States, should urge the government to intervene and must not stand idly by. I deeply hope that the Chinese army in Shanghai will resist to the end, then the great powers will definitely come out and help China to achieve success. From this, we can also see that the greatness of the Shanghai gunshots has crossed the Pacific Ocean and awakened the Americans. One day, my friend was eating in a small eatery. Several Americans at the next table were talking boastfully about the Battle of Shanghai, with many derogatory remarks about the Japanese. Later, seeing my friend, they mistakenly thought he was Japanese, so they all offered comfort. My friend quickly told them that he was not Japanese, but a respectable Chinese. They then rushed to shake hands with my friend and raise their glasses to toast, such was their opportunism. Although the above two incidents are just minor anecdotes, from this we should always remember this glorious and great Battle of Shanghai. Because our overseas Chinese have never been respected by people when residing abroad. This is the first time in decades that they have been able to speak out and raise their eyebrows.</p>

<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>Among fish, there are many strange ones.</p>
<p>Climbing trees to catch fish: Mencius said to King Xuan of Qi, "To do what you are doing to seek what you want to get is like climbing trees to catch fish." It means that climbing trees to catch fish is impossible. Unexpectedly, there are actually fish in the world that climb trees. This kind of fish is produced in East India. It can use the small hooks outside its gill covers to climb tree trunks.</p>
<p>Electric fish: Humans have worked hard and spent the thoughts and efforts of many scientists and engineers to create generators. But unexpectedly, there is a kind of fish in nature that can automatically release electricity without any effort. This kind of fish is produced in the rivers of South America and Africa.</p>
<p>Flying fish: Birds can fly and fish can swim. This is a fact that everyone knows. But conversely, it is also possible to say that birds can swim and fish can fly. Passengers taking ships from Shanghai to Europe and the United States can often see flying fish on the ocean.</p>
<p>Bullet-shooting fish: There is a kind of fish in East India that can spit out water droplets from its mouth to knock insects into the water, which is similar to the sword heroes described in our country's novels who spit out white light from their mouths.</p>
<p>Lantern fish: At the bottom of the deep sea, sunlight cannot reach it. It is truly what is called "the sky is wrong and the earth is dark, the sun and moon have no light." Fish living here can emit their own light to guide them in the darkness.</p>
<p>Fish in a dried-up pond: Although the pond is dried up, some fish may not die. The lungfish produced in Africa usually swim in the water. When it is dry and the water dries up, it hides in the mud, breathing air and living.</p>

<p>— ·Tie·Mi·Tuo</p>
<p>Modified Anti-Aircraft Gun: The modified anti-aircraft gun was invented by Dai Hongbin, the commander of the armored vehicle unit of the Third Route Army. It was modified from a 29-fold Creusot field gun with a caliber of 7 centimeters. It is installed on a specially made steel armored vehicle's dome-shaped gun platform. The top is made of steel rails, and people stand below it to operate it. It is easy to use. Its range is 75 degrees in the air and 7,300 meters in height. The projectile is shrapnel. The shell is divided into ten layers, each layer containing 18 bullets. The explosion force reaches 20 meters in width and 70 meters in length. It was tested in Jinan.</p>
<p>Flying Mine: The flying mine was invented by Cai Linsheng. Cai is also a factory member of the Northeast Arsenal. The flying mine is a kind of automatic elliptical projectile. The body is 70 centimeters long. The medicine cylinder is 50 centimeters long and its caliber is 30 centimeters wide. It was first tested in Shenyang. It flew as high as 1,000 meters. It was then tested in Xindu. The power was slightly inferior, but it also reached over 800 meters. The explosion force reached 60 meters. When it reaches a considerable height, it can also explode on its own. This year, when the Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai, on February 13th, it was reported that it was used to resist the bandits. It shattered a bandit plane at the Sun Temple.</p>
<p>Rocket: The rocket was invented jointly by Guo Liquan and Zhao Jiulong. Both gentlemen are also factory members of the Northeast Arsenal. The rocket is a modification of the flying mine. The only difference is that the degree of repair only reaches one-fifth. The caliber is also smaller. The range is the same as the flying mine.</p>
<h3 id="e187">On Wang Shaolou's Soul-Stealing Bell <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Huogong</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou's arrival in Shanghai this time has been extremely well-received by audiences. His performance skills are indeed excellent. However, from my perspective, the "Soul-Stealing Bell" is the most unique and interesting. This play of his uses the method of singing old plays with new arrangements. The opening scene uses the "Returning Dragon Pavilion," with the phrase "changing clothes inside the Dragon and Phoenix Pavilion" from "Return Dragon Pavilion," followed by a "xipi daoban" (a type of musical interlude in Peking Opera). Then, he sings the "xipi yuanban" (a main melody in Peking Opera), which is Yang Yanzhao from "Beheading the Son" descending the stage to welcome his mother. "Visiting Mother" is like a wild goose from the south losing its flock and scattering. "Nanyang Pass" sighs that parents cannot help but shed tears like pearls. "Pearl Curtain Village" recalls the Five Phoenix Tower of yesteryear. "Celebrating Top Pearl" laments that his family is poor and has no means. "Reporting a Strange Injustice" says that in an instant, dark clouds cover the sky. "Fa Men Temple," the villain Liu Jin, has a general's head hanging high on a pole. Then, he explains that Pigsy has been ordered by the Monkey King to explore Lion Camel Ridge. Because the road is long and he is tired, he sings opera to relieve boredom. He then sings three segments from "Teaching the Son," Wang Chun'e's "Old Xue Bao, you don't need to plead bitterly..." Xue Bao's "Advise the Third Lady to stop shedding tears..." and Chun'e's "You say he is young, but he is not small..." He plays both the male and female roles and sings in rapid succession. The audience finds it enjoyable, but it must be tiring for the performer. The following is the "Yi Tune," "Returning Boat in the Wind and Rain," sung very much in the style of Chang Shutian. Then, he performs the sword dance from "Farewell My Concubine." The dance is personally taught by Mei Lanfang, so it is naturally exceptionally captivating. After the dance, he does two "hawk flips" and lies straight down. He gets up and walks the flower steps, then uses a "da mian" (painted face) voice to sing the "xipi duo ban," the original lyrics of stealing the bell from passing through the Black Cloud Cave. Later, he sees the female character (the female lion) making a humorous explanation, which is also very interesting. Then, he steals the fake bell and fights with the demons, showing off the iron rake. He sees the Earth God and has another long humorous explanation. Then, he transforms into a small Pigsy and finally follows the Monkey King to the double-advance formation, performing the "banchao tian deng diao mao" (a challenging acrobatic move). It is done very lively. Then, the beautiful monkey comes up and drags him down by the waist. Only then is the play finished. The soul-stealing bell of ordinary actors is not sung like this. That's why I say it's particularly interesting. "If you don't believe me," please go see it for yourself.</p>

<p>The on-duty clerk, with a forced smile on his face, slightly nodded to An Yutian. This was considered a complete act of courtesy, barely expressing gratitude. Then, he took a business card, raised it high with his hand, and gestured towards the door, saying, "Please." An Yutian hurriedly said goodbye to Wan Jinsheng and entered the large reception hall. He glanced inadvertently at both sides and saw the same scene as yesterday, with many scholars solemnly and silently present. However, he had now ascended to the sky and would no longer be relegated to the position of a petrified exhibit. He couldn't help but feel a sense of the past and present and strangely thought of these poor people sitting there bored. It must be that he had such a virtuous wife to plan for him, so he didn't have to endure this kind of bitter task every day. He then felt very happy and pitied those people very much. From the clerk's office door, he turned to the back and entered a second gate like an iron threshold. Two armed guards stood watch. The clerk said, "Without their guidance, no one can enter here, except for the most prestigious incumbent division commanders and the main leaders of this office." An Yutian gratefully accepted the favor and paid solemn respect. After passing through a large courtyard, there was a row of tall houses facing him. Four guards with hand-held submachine guns stood in formation on the steps. He walked into the house and went straight to the easternmost room, which was Military Governor Ye's signing room. Many people could not easily step into it even after waiting for a year or two. However, things in the world are difficult when they are said to be difficult, and easy when they are said to be easy. The clerk only opened the doors and windows and announced inside that Councilor An had arrived. He didn't even need a card. An Yutian entered with fear and trepidation. Ye Zuozhang was wearing a military uniform and sitting on a swivel chair behind a large desk. He glanced at An Yutian and waved with a smile. An Yutian bowed quickly and stood beside the desk. Ye Zuozhang opened his mouth and asked, "Has your wife come?" An Yutian replied that she was at the hotel. Ye Zuozhang then said, "She can come to the office to play often." As he spoke, he happily swayed his small body in the chair. Then, he talked about whether the hotel was convenient or not. An Yutian then boldly presented a memorial requesting approval to recruit troops. Ye Zuozhang readily picked up a pen and wrote an approval, appointing An Yutian as the recruiting commissioner, with a deadline of one month to complete the task. After inspecting the weapons and personnel, he would be assigned a military position. He pointed to an officer wearing a lieutenant general's epaulette on the opposite chair and said to the chief of staff, "Let him handle this official business." An Yutian was overjoyed and bowed to both sides to express his gratitude. Then, others came to see Ye Zuozhang to talk. An Yutian retreated to the side and carefully examined the room's decorations. He saw walls full of photographs and mirror frames, and a few pairs of couplets personally written by the current president and prime minister. There wasn't much to see, so he quietly walked out and hurried home to report the good news. To know what happened next, please read the next chapter.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Financial and Gold Markets Rise and Fall Unpredictably <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Final Result: Down 2.3 Taels</p>
<p>High at the Beginning, Low at the End, Indicating Weakness: Yesterday's gold price started high and ended low, and the situation was confusing. There were a total of six taels of gold transacted throughout the day. Overall, people were bewildered, and buying and selling varied among traders. The final result was a drop of 2.0 taels. The market opened high in the morning because the silver market was reported to be down and the exchange rate was also slightly lower. Subsequently, the market fluctuated unpredictably. While the exchange rate for British pounds was firm and the US dollar was soft, foreign news reported that the Lausanne Conference was unlikely to continue and would need to be postponed. Therefore, the market suddenly became weak. Furthermore, US dollar banks were willing to sell, causing the market price to plummet by six taels. The market stabilized at noon, and later the market turned from weak to strong due to foreign speculators covering their short positions. However, selling pressure remained strong, and the market continued to weaken. In terms of drafts, it was said that the market was doing a "pinning" maneuver. The detailed situation of the whole day is recorded below:</p>
<p>Morning Opening Was Promising, Noon Closing Was Downward: The opening price for August rose slightly by 1.6 qian, to 738.5 taels. The general market narrowed by 1/16, the silver price by 1/8, and private telegrams also reflected this. However, the European market recovered after being weak, and there seemed to be more buyers after the market closed, so confidence was neutral, and the market could not be raised too high. Later, Yuan Maoyong, Bingxing, Tongchun, Yuan Hengyu, and He and others continued to sell. The price fell by two taels, to 36 taels 1 qian. The US dollar was flat. The Mumbai rate for September was 68.75, and the August half-dollar could be settled. Later, Dalian gangs and Zhifengyong and others bought in, and the August US dollar was also exchanged for half a dollar, immediately raising the price by 2.0 taels. At 9:20 AM, the price was 38.5 taels. At that time, Hongkang, Yongbingxing, Yuan Maoyong, and others continued to sell, causing the price to fall by more than one tael. At 9:30 AM, the exchange rate for the British pound was unchanged. The US dollar was quoted at a rate of 2.5 qian lower due to a small squeeze in the exchange rate, at around 37 taels. There was only a small drop of 7-8 qian. Fuyu, Yuanheng, Hongkang, Yongda, Decheng goods were all on offer. HSBC offered November, British gold at 375, China Bank offered September US dollars at 625, so at 10:00 AM, the price was 36 taels 2 qian. Shortly thereafter, buyers became active. Yifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong goods, Yuan Kangxiang all bought in. Wheat Bank bought an August half-dollar, causing the price to surge by three taels. At 10:20 AM, the price was 39 taels 2 qian, and suddenly fell by more than one tael, and then Hengyu, Xiexingyong sold off, at 37 taels 5 qian. At that time, Mitsubishi suddenly sold HSBC a June British gold at 1875, and also matched the US dollar at the same rate, calculated at 4375 for August. The market Qian Changxiang, Zhifengyong, Yuan Dayong, Futaixing, Hengchangyong, and others scrambled to buy in, immediately adding two taels. At 10:38 AM, the price reached 39 taels 5 qian. After this, the market seemed to be heading downward, and there were reports that the Lausanne Conference could not continue. Especially because Hengxing, Fuyu, Yuan Maoyong, Hongkangyong, Yuantai goods, and others were selling off, Hengyu also sold, and Qianfeng came out with July at 3125, October at 30.75, and also offered September British gold at 3125, so the gold price declined sharply, falling sharply by six taels, to 33 taels 5 qian at 10:50 AM, with no turning back. After entering the market, Dadecheng, Shunli, Hengxing, and others bought in, and the price was pushed up by three taels. At 11:30 AM, the price was 36 taels 7 qian, and in an instant, it fell by 1.34 qian, to 35 taels 3 qian. General long position retail investors were forced to liquidate. After that, only a few qian were traded, and the trading volume varied from firm to firm. At the noon closing, the price was 36 taels 3 qian, and then it was suppressed to within six taels.</p>
<p>A Brief Rise, Ultimately Falling: The market opened in the afternoon at 35 taels 7 qian, followed by 35 taels. Hengyu was the first to sell. Later, because Fuxingyong, Dayong, Dade Ruixing all bought in, and China-Belgium absorbed October British gold at 375, June US dollars at 25, the price jumped by three taels. At 2:40 PM, the price was 38 taels. But Bingxing, Yuanmao, and others sold off, and the August US dollar was still valued at 4375 for settlement, down more than two taels. Around 3:00 PM, the price was 35 taels 6 qian. Ruixing bought in again, acting as a hedge for Qiao Zhifu's short position. Yifengyong, Dayong, Tongtaichang, Yuan Maoyong also bought in, and the price was pulled back to 36 taels 7 qian. After that, the market was flat. After 3:30 PM, Dadecheng and Hengyu were actively selling, while the exchange rate was stable. Until 3:50 PM, the price was only 34 taels 2 qian. Chenxing bought in slightly. After 4:00 PM, the price was 36 taels, but Hengyu's selling pressure did not abate. At the 4:30 PM closing, the price was 34 taels 6 qian, down 2.3 qian compared to the previous day. On a daily basis, the highest price was 39.5 taels, and the lowest was 33.5 taels, a difference of six taels. The red bar (full tael) increased by 13 taels, and the deferred trade was only 4.8 qian.</p>
<p>The Revealed Price is Mostly Suppressed by 8-9 Taels: The revealed price was changed to 807 taels, because the US dollar was quoted small by 25, calculated as suppressing from 71 taels to 67-68 taels. The closing price was 71 taels. In the afternoon, the price was 71-72 taels, which was more suppressed by 8-9 taels compared to the previous day. The registered price for June-July was 41 taels, August 36 taels, replenishment water (interest) 41 taels, afternoon 40 taels.</p>
<p>Trading in the Market Was Very Active: Spot trading was very prosperous. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Yuan Dayong, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Kangxiang, Hengchangyong, Futaixing, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, and Shunli all bought in. Yuan Maoyong, Wanxing, Yuantai, and Tongchun had mixed buying and selling. Heng, Bingxing, Hongkangyong, Yuhe, Fuyu, Xiexingyong, Dadecheng, and Tongtaichang all sold off. In the afternoon, Fuxingyong, Yuan Maoyong, Yifengyong, Ruixing, Daxingyong bought in to hedge Qiao Zhifu's position. Qian Changxiang and Tongtaichang all bought in.

The Guangdong gangs sold over 1,000 and bought in a small amount.</p>

On the bank side, HSBC and China Bank were both sellers. Mumbai also telegraphed to sell September.

<p>Yesterday (21st), the situation of various bond markets in the Chinese Securities Exchange, spot trading fell, with a total of 17,000 yuan opened throughout the day, and the futures market also slightly dispersed. In the morning market, the two sessions, the market situation was still lively, with a transaction volume of more than 3 million yuan, but the afternoon market was very clear, with only 1.4 million yuan opened. Speaking of the changes in the price of each bond, when it was first opened in the morning, the market sentiment was still good, and various parties invested in the income, and the price gradually rose. The second session was active with selling transactions, and the price shrank slightly. The two sessions in the afternoon were sluggish due to quiet buying, and the selling side only had sporadic transactions, so the prices were sluggish without a major drop. As a result, the price fell more than 0.23 yuan compared with the previous day. Only a few kinds of spot goods still rose. Judging from the bond market situation, it seems to be trending towards stagnation again.</p>

<p>(Report by Meidong Bank Company)</p>
<p>On Monday, the New York stock market was very quiet, with only 400,000 shares traded throughout the day, which was unprecedented this year. Most people in the industry are waiting for the opportunity. The market once rose, but the price fell again due to more selling. At the closing, there was no major rise or fall compared with the end of last week. The wheat price and bond market were firm. The quietness of the stock market in the past few days is mostly due to the extension of the congressional session. Based on the previous example of the market moving after extreme quietness, and because the closing of this congressional session is beneficial to the sentiment of the stock market, it can be predicted that the market will soon have a turnaround, and its market will inevitably tend to be upward.

<p>The cotton yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation was still sluggish. The real reason is the decline of the domestic economic situation, the current yarn sales are stagnant, each gang has no vitality, and the price of a certain factory yarn is cheap, and shipments from North China are continuous, and the main yarn is greatly affected. Therefore, the market sentiment is especially tired. Only the Changsha gang bought a huge amount of bids, and the buyer's attitude is still high, because their bottom plate has been small, so they are tightening it and not letting go. In short, the environment is bad, and the future is still bleak.</p>
<p>The Bid Market Was Good in the Morning and Continued to Fall Back in the Afternoon: The bid market opened in the morning, because the US cotton rose back, causing a part of the shorts to hedge, rising 4.6 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the real demand in the front market was not smooth, and it fell again, with each month falling 6-7 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,400 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 2,400 bales, Yongda 650 bales, Changji 400 bales, and Yichang bought 700 bales, Tianlong 600 bales, Tonghe 1,250 bales, and Ruida 750 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>September 1416 149,000</p>
<p>The Spot is Stagnant and Does Not Move Forward: The spot removal is still stagnant. It was found that the total number of bales bought by each gang throughout the day was 650 bales, 12 bales were entered among the industry, the market was flat, the Guangdong guest gang entered 260 bales, the mainland 47 bales, Ningbo 15 bales, Yunnan 315 bales, Wenzhou 15 bales, Xiamen 1 bale, Xuzhou 10 bales, Shantou 10 bales, and Hong Kong 10 bales.</p>

<p>Recent Cotton Experienced a Short Squeeze</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm. Due to a slight rise in US cotton and a lack of inventory among near-month buyers, there are rumors of non-delivery. However, factories have stocked up on foreign cotton last year, eliminating the need to purchase more. Moreover, warehouses in this port hold a massive 170,000 bales of American and Indian cotton, totaling approximately 600,000 piculs. Therefore, realistically speaking, it is difficult to reverse the situation. The Tianjin cotton market has plummeted, but a portion of interests in this port, believing the drop was too severe, are temporarily bullish and attempting to drive prices higher. Yesterday, a telegram stated that foreign cotton in a certain country rose by one yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Recovers by Three to Four Cents. In the pre-market trading of Zheng Biao, prices rose by two to three cents due to a slight increase in US cotton and a lack of sellers in the market. In the afternoon, near-month bulls bought aggressively, pushing prices up by one cent, while far-month prices remained flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 21,600 bales. It was found that 1,300 piculs were sold by Mingde, 2,200 piculs by Yongda, 1,400 piculs by Gengfeng, 1,700 piculs by Changfeng, and 2,100 piculs by Yu Chang. 3,200 piculs were bought by Yifeng, 2,000 piculs by Yiji, and 1,300 piculs by Renfeng. The closing prices are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Prices, Fluctuations, Inventory</p>
<p>October 2883, Up 3, 141,900</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for each month showed a slight firming trend due to a rebound of about two, three, or four cents in oat quotations. Additionally, due to factories holding back inventory, there was a lack of selling, causing prices to rise by about one cent. However, buyers became quiet, and prices slightly declined again. After the afternoon opening, the market did not appear stable. Later, buying activity from customer groups, although small in quantity, boosted market sentiment, especially for August deliveries, where factories seemed unwilling to release inventory. As a result, July prices increased by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, August and September prices increased by 5 li, and October prices increased by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Wheat Market Boosted by the Moldy Rain <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for each month stabilized, especially for long-term contracts. This was due to a rebound of two, three, or four cents in oat quotations. Although the weather cleared up yesterday, continuous moldy rain had caused flooding in various places, shifting market sentiment and increasing buying interest. Additionally, factories were reluctant to release a large amount of inventory, suggesting that flour prices had bottomed out. The strength of long-term contracts was due to this factor. Near-term contracts stabilized due to profit-taking by bulls. As a result, July prices increased by one cent, August prices increased by two cents, September prices increased by three cents, and October prices increased by four cents. The supply of current wheat was limited, and factory inventory was stable. Changre wheat was trading at 2.90 yuan, peaking at 2.94 yuan, with 500 bags purchased by Huafeng.</p>
<p>Zhabei Goods - The first batch of Xinghaikou branches has arrived</p>
<p>Only twenty boxes of Xinghaikou branches have recently arrived in Hong Kong. It is understood that they have been purchased by a certain firm here and were rushed to Shanghai yesterday. However, it is reported that subsequent batches are expected to arrive in the coming days. Various firms are hesitant to set prices, as both excessively high and low prices are considered unsuitable. Therefore, they are mainly observing the market and have not yet made any transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e201">If You Don't Understand the Law <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The lack of clarity in legal provisions often leads to misunderstandings between judges and parties involved. There are numerous examples of this, and I cannot discuss them all individually. Let me just give one example.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper, I was surprised to read about a case where a spouse was not allowed to file a private prosecution for bigamy. I am not someone who has studied law and naturally don't understand its intricacies. However, from a logical and emotional standpoint, the reason for not allowing private prosecution is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>It is said that Article 339 of the Code of Criminal Procedure explicitly states this. The article reads, "The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs do not apply to lineal relatives, spouses, or relatives living under the same roof." Indeed, this article clearly states that spouses cannot file a private prosecution. However, the simple provision does not explain why. It seems that the legislator's intention is that such cases concern national legal interests or violate public morals and must be prosecuted by the public prosecutor.</p>
<p>However, Article 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states, "If the same case has been privately prosecuted, it cannot be reported to the public prosecutor or judicial police officer again." If these two articles are interpreted together, it seems that all cases must be requested to be prosecuted by the public prosecutor. If the case has already been privately prosecuted, it cannot be reported to the public prosecutor or judicial police officer again. There is no provision that the court absolutely cannot accept private prosecution. If we consider only Article 340, it says that if a case has been privately prosecuted, it cannot be reported to the public prosecutor again. This clearly refers to public prosecution cases. If a case has already been privately prosecuted, a request cannot be made to the public prosecutor again to avoid double prosecution. The reasoning is clear.</p>
<p>The crime of bigamy is one that directly and most painfully affects the spouse. Originally, lineal ascendants should have the right to report the crime. However, under the system of freedom of marriage, parents naturally don't interfere in their children's affairs. Therefore, private prosecution is the only recourse. So, if the spouse doesn't come forward to report the crime of bigamy, should uncles and cousins do it?</p>
<p>But the law says that bigamy cases must be requested for public prosecution. However, in the special circumstances of the concessions, such cases are commonplace. I don't know if the courts reject all of them or accept some and reject others. If they are all rejected, then victims of bigamy committed in the concessions will naturally have no way to seek redress. This is unreasonable from an emotional and logical standpoint. If it is said that the Municipal Council must be requested to initiate prosecution, that is even more incomprehensible. What was the point of the government's relentless efforts to regain jurisdiction over the concessions? Now, Chinese citizens are pushing away lawsuits between Chinese citizens, requiring them to seek help from the Municipal Council. I truly don't understand.</p>

<p>Electricity is a versatile thing and an indispensable element in the world. In this era of thriving electricity, we must utilize it and know its essence. At the very least, we should have common sense of electricity. Now, I will write down the names of three important meters in electricity and their uses:</p>
<p>(1) Ammeter (Ａｍｐｅｒｅｍｅｔｅｒ) (2) Voltmeter (ＶｏｌｔＭｅｔｅｒ) (3) Ohmmeter (Ｏｈｍｍｅ)</p>
<p>Ammeters are used to measure current. Voltmeters are used to measure voltage (or potential difference) and electromotive force. Ohmmeters are used to measure resistance.</p>
<p>After Ohm's research, he discovered that the magnitude of resistance is inversely proportional to current and directly proportional to potential difference. Assuming V is the potential difference, A is the amount of current, and R is the magnitude of resistance, we can establish the following formula:</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>R=-</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>Knowing the above formula, we can use the laws of algebra to list the following two formulas:</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>A=-　　V=AR</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>The above three formulas were created by Ohm, so we call this law Ohm's Law.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Pastime of Shanghai Ladies <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my younger brother and I bought some things at Sincere Department Store and returned home. Passing through an alley, two children suddenly approached, holding a stack of leaflets printed with lead letters. Smiling, they handed each of us one. I usually hate being given leaflets and never accept any on the street. However, seeing that these two children were young, lively, and innocent, I was prompted by curiosity to find out the purpose of their leaflets. I only took a look, but it would have been better if I hadn't. It made me laugh. The leaflet read:</p>
<p>"A stone tablet of Liu Bowen has been discovered in a certain place. This year, China will be in great chaos. Certain provinces will experience floods, certain provinces will experience wars, and certain provinces will experience plagues..."</p>
<p>In short, according to this leaflet, no part of China will be spared this year. Below were some nonsensical sentences, nothing more than:</p>
<p>"First worry, there is food but no one to eat; second worry, there are clothes but no one to wear; third worry, there are roads but no one to walk; fourth worry..."</p>
<p>"Fifth worry..." and so on, up to the tenth worry.</p>
<p>Below were also three magical talismans, said to prevent disasters if drawn on the door. If everyone could print and distribute these leaflets, doing good deeds would dispel misfortune and prolong life. Otherwise, nine out of ten people would die this year, and even chickens and dogs would not be spared.</p>
<p>Walking past, I found the same leaflets pasted on the walls at the alley entrance. After a few days, there were more and more leaflets. Every time we went out, people would hand them out, and the walls of the alley were covered with them. Before long, Mrs. Zhang next door, Mrs. Li across the street, and so on, were all asking people to print these leaflets for distribution.</p>
<p>Nonsense like "In a certain month this year, the world will be in chaos and darkness" and "In a certain month, there will be mass deaths" can often be heard and are not worth a scholar's laugh. But some old ladies believe these messages to be true, telling everyone and inquiring everywhere. As a result, besides verbally advising people to be good, they also print and distribute leaflets.</p>
<p>Originally, the ladies of Shanghai have nothing to do all day after eating their fill. Sitting at home, they feel bored. With these rumors, they have something to talk about. At the same time, they are panicked, as if a great disaster is imminent. As for distributing leaflets, the wealthy ladies naturally don't care. The poor ones may even save money to print leaflets. This is also a pastime for Shanghai ladies.</p>
<p>While the ladies are rushing to print and distribute leaflets, the printing shops are having the best luck.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Students Testing the Teacher <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met my old friend Mr. Zhao, whom I hadn't seen for many years. Of course, we exchanged recent updates. I asked him, "I haven't seen you for a long time. What have you been up to lately?" He said, "Nothing special, just working as a teacher in a small elementary school." I said, "Being a teacher is very leisurely, unlike me, who makes a living with a pen and ink, constantly working on documents all day without a moment of free time!" He said, "Being a teacher is indeed relatively leisurely, but sometimes it's not easy. When you encounter mischievous students who play tricks, there's nothing you can do. They often look up strange, obscure words or uncommon allusions in the dictionary to ask me. If the teacher can't answer immediately, they'll mock him. Isn't that embarrassing?" I laughed and said, "That's what you call 'Zhang Tianshi possessed by a ghost, having magic but no way to use it!'" He laughed too, and we shook hands and parted in laughter.</p>
<p>When I returned home, Mr. Zhao's words reminded me of when I was a child, studying in a small elementary school in my hometown (Huzhou). The Chinese teacher was a scholar with a solid foundation in Chinese classics. One day, after he had finished explaining a lesson, he told everyone to read the lesson again because it was still early before the end of class. If there was anything they didn't understand, they could ask him. Then a certain student, nicknamed "Old Year Flowered Eagle," who was notoriously mischievous, didn't read the text but looked up words in the dictionary. He found the three characters "錫," "茶," and "壼" in the dictionary and wrote them down to ask the teacher, saying, "What are these characters?" The Chinese teacher said to that student, "Don't you recognize these three characters? They are "雪," "查," and "胡," which is a tin teapot." The student then pretended to be serious and said, "How come I just looked it up in the dictionary, and these three characters are called Yang, Tu, and Kun. I was still a little confused, so I wrote them down to ask the teacher. Now that the teacher says "these three characters are pronounced "雪," "查," and "胡," which is a tin teapot," then it must be the dictionary's mistake." The Chinese teacher, hearing the student say this, carefully looked at the three characters "錫," "茶," and "壼" again. It turned out that each character had an extra stroke compared to the characters "錫," "茶," and "壼." If he hadn't consulted the dictionary, he really wouldn't have recognized them. At that time, I saw the Chinese teacher's expression, truly embarrassed and laughable! This is what Mr. Zhao was talking about, "students testing the teacher," inevitably embarrassing the teacher.</p>
<p>Business Skills</p>
<h3 id="e207">Busy <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zaichang</p>
<p>Talking about business, Mr. Xi vividly described a doctor, saying,</p>
<p>Once, because there was a patient at home, it was inevitable to ask a doctor to take a look. As for famous doctors, a large amount of money is required to get them to "look up to" or "condescend," otherwise "the rich man's gate is as deep as the sea," and you can only be "Xiao Lang is a passerby." If you want them to "come quickly," it's even more difficult. No matter how anxiously the patient is like an ant on a hot pot, waiting until his neck is as long as a luffa, he still arrives late. That's how famous doctors are. Then the only choice is not to consult them. Fortunately, the patient has a minor illness, so it's better to ask a doctor who lives nearby and isn't famous and whose practice is deserted. First, the price is cheap, and second, it's easy to ask and they arrive quickly. Once the decision was made, it was immediately carried out. Satisfyingly, within half an hour, he could "condescend to visit." Who knew that three hours passed and still no sign of him? Suspicions made me wonder if he was popular now? Was business busy? Finally, he did come. The doctor came! I saw him panting and running, his face red. From his own announcement, I learned that he had just examined a patient somewhere and had only now arrived here. He hastily looked at the patient, hastily wrote a prescription, and from his own announcement, he had to go to another consultation elsewhere. So I saw him leave very hurriedly. After the doctor left, I thought, "Even bricks and tiles have their day to turn over." A doctor who had previously been unasked for had suddenly become popular.</p>
<p>A few days later, a friend of mine who was familiar with that doctor came to talk to me. Unintentionally, we talked about that doctor. I asked him,</p>
<p>"Do you know how he suddenly got lucky, and business has become so busy?"</p>
<p>"Where did you hear that?" my friend asked me.</p>
<p>So I told him this story. Unexpectedly, my friend burst out laughing at me, then said,</p>
<p>"You also fell into his trap. This is his advertising plan, completely a business tactic."</p>

<h3 id="e208">Electric Rabbit <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The movie had been going on for half the time. During the ten-minute intermission, several young artists from the same art group were sitting in a row, waiting for the "superbly beautiful and world-renowned European female star Anna Antler starring, supremely interesting and wondrous construction of Speedy First Kiss (Anny Onkrain; All for Kiss'" to continue playing.</p>
<p>The beauty of this film is just as the theater advertised, "Completely bringing the unrestrained attitude of Western women to the screen, with unexpected wonders..." This is highly praised by Mr. A, who advocates extreme freedom in love. He even dared to compare the female lead in the play to Miss Wu, whom he admired. So he called out in the typical tone of a poet:</p>
<p>"Ah! This is simply a portrait of our Angel! How realistic it is."</p>
<p>"Our Miss Wu? Oh! No, Old A, you can't insult her like that. What reason do you have to curse her?" Little Chen, who calls himself a playwright and has the nickname "Wild Dog," spoke in pure Mandarin as if reading lines.</p>
<p>"That's right, it's really unreasonable. Just because she doesn't love you, do you have to insult her personality?" The beautiful novelist was simply angry. Old A then added:</p>
<p>"Who says so? She doesn't love me? I'm the one who's ignoring her."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's not the case?" The young artist chimed in. "She is so beautiful, with rosy cheeks and deep red, dripping lips. Who wouldn't be moved by her? If I didn't already have a lover, I would fall in love with her."</p>
<p>"That's right, who doesn't know? Chasing her like a dog all day long, who can you hide it from?" "Wild Dog" said again. So Old A became angry out of embarrassment and even cursed out loud.</p>
<p>"Bullshit! You're the real wild dog!"</p>
<p>At this time, the vocalist, Tao Shao, who was on the far right, suddenly raised his loud voice and said:</p>
<p>"Everyone doesn't need to say anything. You are all dogs running in the dog track, desperately chasing the electric rabbit in front. Whoever has the highest stake will run in the front, but the electric rabbit can never be caught. It's just a waste of effort."</p>
<p>"........"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the lights went out, and the beautiful girl appeared in front of them again, so everyone had to concentrate on dealing with this current illusion.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Being a Traitor for Five Minutes <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Old classmate Mr. T came to school to see me. As soon as he sat down, he said to me with a smile:</p>
<p>"I was a traitor for five minutes! I tasted the flavor of being a traitor!" Who did? A traitor, a traitor! Are they divided into five minutes or ten minutes? I couldn't help but ask him in surprise. After I asked him, he told the whole story from beginning to end.</p>
<p>"When I walked to Zhonghongqiao, just about to get on the bridge but not yet, more than thirty armed soldiers from ×× walked horizontally. The sentry patrolmen had already placed their wooden sticks horizontally, and I couldn't break through their path, so I had to stop. The one in the lead, with a red border on his hat, was probably the captain. He thought about me, slightly lifted his hat, and said in very awkward Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>"Where to go to Honganji (Nishi Hongwanji)?"</p>
<p>Of course, I explained to him that it was on Wuchang Road and indicated it with gestures. He pointed at me with his hand, meaning he wanted me to be a guide. At that time, I had no choice but to walk, so I had to guide him forward. However, the eyes of my compatriots on the road were all on me, clearly thinking that I was a traitor. Although I was innocent, I couldn't help but blush. I also really admitted that I had become a traitor, but it only lasted for five minutes, so I said I was a traitor for five minutes."</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Small and Capable British Austin - Dan Hua <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Generally, pioneers and visionaries must undergo a period of intense struggle and declare war on fate before they can achieve success and shine through the ages. Civilization gains a step forward, and humanity gains a bit more happiness. It is indeed a gift from those with foresight and vision.</p>
<p>Affordable and rapid transportation is a modern treasure, and Lord Austin, the pioneering founder of this field, occupies a prominent position. His invention, the Austin Seven, is like a revolutionary army in the automotive world, now popular everywhere and becoming a necessity.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven is a pioneer among small cars. Its high capabilities and widespread popularity have exceeded the inventor's expectations.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was not specifically designed as a racing car, but it surpassed its peers in the 1923 Italian Grand Prix and won the first prize. The following year, it set nineteen records for 750cc class cars. It also won prizes and honors in various European countries.</p>
<p>In 1926, it participated in the Australian 632-mile race. Despite the extremely difficult conditions, it triumphed, which is particularly commendable. It also set three records in Brooklands.</p>
<p>The following year, it set even more records at Montlhéry, from three hours to five hundred miles. In 1928, it set five more records at the same location, reaching as high as twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>In the following year, it distinguished itself both domestically and internationally, especially in Northern Ireland and South Africa.</p>
<p>1930 was the year the Austin Seven set new records in New Zealand and South Africa, and it also won the Double Twelve race.</p>
<p>Recently, Mrs. Souter drove an Austin Seven at 110 miles per hour and set four international records. Such are the achievements of the Austin Seven in the racing world.</p>
<p>In other aspects, the Austin Seven, with its solid construction and exquisite design, is fearless in the face of adversity. Anyone who has driven it is amazed by its great capabilities.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was the first car to drive to the top of Table Mountain.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was the first car to ascend and descend Ben Nevis in one day.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was the first car to be driven around the world by a woman.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was the first car to be driven solo across Europe to Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was the first car used in polar expeditions, enduring intense pulling every day.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven was the first car to reach Cape York in Queensland.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven is the first 750cc car to drive the measured miles and kilometers at a speed of over 100 miles per hour.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that even in the worst weather or road conditions, sometimes with no roads at all, the Austin Seven can reach everywhere and overcome dangers with ease.</p>
<p>Facts are the greatest debaters. Any further words would be gilding the lily.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Alarming Number of British Vehicle Accidents - Pei <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Eighteen People Die Under Wheels Every Day</p>
<p>London Dispatch. Recently, the Minister of Transport, Mr. Pybus, and other government officials in charge of traffic management, declared that road accident cases in Great Britain are increasing daily, causing widespread public anxiety. According to Mr. Pybus's report to the House of Commons, in 1931, 6,691 people in England died in road accidents, and 200,219 were injured as a result. The magnitude of these numbers is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>In 1931, the total number of British people who died, were disabled, or injured due to vehicle accidents was 208,810. This exceeds the number of British soldiers killed, wounded, and lost to disease in the Boer War by more than four times. Such a huge number of casualties in a single year of peace is truly noteworthy. These statistics were released during a meeting of the National Safety Council and during National Safety Week. The National Safety Council discussed various accident events related to transportation and industry.</p>
<p>The traffic accident casualty rate averages eighteen deaths and 533 injuries on the nation's roads every day. Comparing the statistics of 1930 and 1931, there were 614 fewer deaths in 1931, but 24,224 more injuries. In the London area alone, 27,977 traffic accidents occurred in the first three months of this year, resulting in 314 deaths and 10,865 injuries. Among the dead, 224 were pedestrians, 20 were car owners, 40 were cyclists, and 24 were motorcycle drivers.</p>
<p>During the National Safety Council meeting in the United Kingdom, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Transport, Mr. Bickerdike, gave a speech, stating that the majority of accident events can be reduced by preventive measures. For example, if a plague were to break out in the country and the number of deaths were similar to that of these vehicle accidents, then all medical professionals in the country would immediately rise up and urgently seek preventive medicines.</p>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>As for preventing vehicle accidents, stricter penalties are needed. It is also necessary to awaken public judgment and impose adequate penalties on reckless drivers who cause the loss of others' lives.</p>
<p>Regarding the causes of vehicle accidents, generally speaking, in cities, the blame lies with pedestrians, while in the countryside, drivers should be held responsible. This is generally accepted by the public. In the first three months of this year, 224 people in London, England, died under vehicles, of which the police blamed 163 for negligence. This is because those from the countryside often do not pay attention to traffic control, which leads to this. Therefore, since London started using automatic traffic lights, car drivers have become more cautious, while pedestrians have become careless, crossing the streets at will.</p>
<p>Regarding car accidents in the countryside, according to the Royal Automobile Club, the blame should be attributed to both parties. Accidents occur when they pass each other in places with poor visibility or are careless when turning. Also, when entering a main road from a side road, if the view ahead is unclear and one is not careful, a major disaster can occur. As for careless pedestrians in bustling cities, the only way to deal with them is to impose severe penalties to remind them. Furthermore, cyclists who arbitrarily weave through traffic should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Although vehicle accidents in the United Kingdom in 1931 were 614 fewer than in 1930, 1931 was a year of economic recession, and the number of registered cars decreased by 3.2 percent, so the number of accidents also decreased by 8.5 percent. Traffic accidents in London in 1931 were 73 fewer than in 1930. According to Mr. Bickerdike, this is because there were fewer deaths of motorcycle drivers and passengers on London streets last year. He also said that the use of motorcycles as a means of transportation in London has decreased compared to before.</p>
<p>A prosthetic leg dealer once told a correspondent for the New York Speaking Platform newspaper that since the end of the war, his largest customers have been those injured while driving motorcycles.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Advantages of the Williams Overrun <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The 113-inch wide wheelbase of the Williams Overrun six-cylinder car now makes the car's driving more stable, and its extended hood further enhances the car's length and grandeur. Therefore, from a practical point of view, everything from the V-shaped water tank to the rear of the car is well-proportioned. This new car has truly opened a new era of the highest standard of beauty for the company's low-priced six-cylinder cars. What is particularly commendable is that this new design is further enhanced by the harmony of various colors, the exquisite and luxurious velvet brown cushions, and the neat and elegant stripes, which complement each other and are extremely beautiful. As for the car body styles, there are five-seater sedans, five-seater small sedans, two-seater coupes, four-seater coupes, two-seater roadsters, four-seater roadsters, and sedans. All of these styles are extremely spacious and exceptionally comfortable. Being inside is no different from being at home. The front seats of the car can be moved forward or backward at will. The backrests of the front seats inside the sedan can also be adjusted at will to suit individual needs and achieve extreme comfort. In addition, the steering column can also be adjusted at will.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Overview of the Citroen Factory - Fu <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Citroen factory is the most important automobile manufacturer in Europe. Its rapid progress and its reputation throughout the country are all due to the excellence and superiority of its manufacturing work, which is unmatched. As for its ability to produce large quantities at the lowest possible cost, it must be attributed to the excellence of its machinery, the adoption of scientific methods, and the meticulous and thoroughness of all its manufacturing management. When the first 14-horsepower Citroen car was launched, it was in 1919. At that time, only 30 cars were produced per day. Since then, the production volume has increased with each passing day. At the beginning of 1927, the daily production volume reached more than 400 cars. However, compared with today, there is still a huge difference, because the current daily output has more than doubled compared to 1927. The Citroen factory is now divided into many locations. It employs 25,000 people, uses 40,000 horsepower, 15,000 pieces of excellent and sophisticated machinery, and 33,000 inches of conveyors and assembly lines. As for its manufacturing work, whether large or small parts, it is constantly striving for excellence and perfection. The factory has its reasons for its achievements today; it is not by chance.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Overview of Highways in Henan Province (Continued) Black Fox <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Road maintenance methods. Roads are built with the original intention of facilitating public travel and the United Motors Company. Recently, another large batch of German Oberle four-cylinder and six-cylinder cars has been shipped in. There are also many specially prepared new cars to welcome people from all walks of life to come and try them out. The picture above is a photo of the Oberle new car in front of the company's gate.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>. If road maintenance methods are not properly planned, allowing vehicles to press on the road and rainwater to wash over it, the roadbed will inevitably collapse and the road surface will crack before long. Therefore, the issue of road maintenance is as important as road construction. The entire territory of Henan, except for the southwestern parts with many mountains, is mostly plains with no end in sight. Road construction is relatively easy compared to other provinces, but maintenance is actually more difficult than in other provinces. The reason is that the soil quality in various places mostly contains sand and has extremely poor cohesion, making it difficult to solidify. Therefore, the roadbed and road surface are eroded by wind and rain and crushed by vehicles, and will collapse before long. Moreover, for thousands of years, the only means of transportation relied upon in Henan Province has been large carts. These carts are made in two types: two-wheeled and four-wheeled. The wheels are wrapped with iron skin. Once loaded, when traveling on the road, the road surface is pressed into deep ruts. Although the provincial government has repeatedly advocated improving the manufacturing methods of large carts and opening large cart roads outside of automobile roads to allow them to travel separately to avoid crushing, the result has been inconvenient. The manufacturing methods remain the same and have not been changed. Avoiding what is difficult and seeking what is easy is human nature. All drivers of large carts want their carts to travel on car roads. Although imperial proclamations are issued and strict penalty rules are established, it is difficult to prohibit them. Therefore, in order to protect the roads, the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau has formulated measures to divide important highways according to the counties they pass through, and assign one member of the local militia and autonomous region residents to guard every ten li. This kind of measure does not increase provincial funds and does not increase the local burden, so it has been implemented in various counties. As for the existing public automobile business on various roads, a budget is being formulated separately to set up road maintenance teams, with one person for every ten li. Currently, a road maintenance team has been established for the Kaixu section, with one team leader and 20 road maintenance workers. Road maintenance teams for other sections, such as Kaizhou and Kaikao, will also be established one after another.</p>
<p>Status of Traffic Operation. Examining the long-distance automobile transportation business in Henan Province, it has not been well-developed in the past. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, in order to facilitate transportation, the Provincial Department of Construction began to vigorously promote and formulate regulations to encourage merchants to run long-distance automobile companies, and ordered eight cars from foreign firms to be operated by the Highway Bureau to promote the official automobile business. However, it stopped operating shortly after starting due to political changes. All the cars were almost completely lost, leaving only two broken cars that could not be driven. In the winter of the 19th year, when the transportation situation stabilized, the Department of Construction again submitted a request to the provincial government to allocate funds to order 20 Chevrolet cars from the Anli Foreign Firm in Hankou. The Department then organized a long-distance automobile business department and actively prepared for traffic (1) The Kaixu Line (Kaifeng to Xuchang) used new cars and changed to simultaneous departures from Kaifeng and Xuchang stations. There were four round trips per day. Various regulations were also formulated, and ticket sales on the bus were abolished and replaced with ticket sales at each station. All management was very strict, and the bus timetable was also very accurate. A total of five stations were set up: Kaifeng, Zhuxianzhen, Weishi, Youchuan, and Xuchang. Passengers along the line can purchase tickets and take the bus at nearby stations according to the scheduled times, which is very convenient for travelers. The business at Kaifeng and Xuchang stations is very good, followed by Weishi and Youchuan stations. Zhuxianzhen station is relatively inferior. (2) The Kaizhou Line (Kaifeng to Zhoujiakou) This line is an important road in southeastern Henan Province, with a large number of travelers coming and going. Originally, it was a commercially run automobile business for transportation, but the vehicles were dilapidated and could not be driven, and the timetable was uncertain. Once the car engine was damaged, it could not arrive until the next day. After the new cars were put into operation, it took about six hours to reach 350 miles, and it could be a round trip in one day. Chenliu, Qixian, Taikang, Huaiyang, Zhoujiakou, and other places along the line are all important towns. Setting up stations to sell tickets, the business income is the highest on this line. (3) The Kaicao Line (Kaifeng to Caozhou) There are four stations along the line: Quxing, Jikaocheng, Caikouzhen, and Caozhou. This line is actually an important road connecting Shandong Province, so the business is gradually developing, and travel is also convenient.</p>
