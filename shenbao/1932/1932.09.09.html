<h3 id="c1">國際問題之總决算期微· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>就最近各方面之情勢觀之。本年年内。似將爲全世界十餘年來一篇糊塗帳目總决算之時期。此一篇糊塗帳目。如幸而彌補得當。則目前紊亂之局面。或尚可以敷衍一時。如不幸而竟致無法彌補。則二次戰禍之發生。或即迫在眉睫。亦未可知。此非故作危言聳聽之詞。乃有種種事實告訴於吾人者也。</p>
<p>陷現世界於混亂不可收拾之局面者。原因固不止一端。但舉其犖犖大者而言。則經濟上不外賠償問題與戰債問題。政治上不外軍縮問題。對俄問題。對俄問題。以及最近極度緊張之中日問題。凡此諸問題。表面上似各各獨立。風馬牛不相關涉。實際上則互相關聯。如有一問題而未能解决。則其餘問題。均將受其影響而莫能爲力矣。</p>
<p>洛桑會議。非已决定解决賠償問題之辦法乎。德國賠欵已大爲削减。然而减削賠欵。必俟美國允許减輕戰債。方可實行。而美國戰債據胡佛之提案。又必俟各國允許縮小軍備三分之一。同時法國之意見。則又以爲欲縮小軍備。非俟法國得有安全保障不可。法國之所謂安全保障。即爲國際聯合以壓制德國。咸仍堅持其神聖之凡爾賽條約。以阻止德國之復興是也。然此非德國所能忍受。且因其足以妨礙世界之平和。亦非歐美各國所能贊同者也。</p>
<p>法國因在歐洲方面陷於孤立之地位。故爲謀安全計。一方不得不殷求與國以增後援。同時又不得不謀聯絡東亞之强國以牽制歐美。於是日本遂得利用機會。以進行其蓄謀已久之满蒙政策。此中日問題之所以日形緊張也。</p>
<p>日本之满蒙政策。雖爲英美諸國所深忌。然初以對俄共同戰線之故。未敢遽與日本破臉。故對俄問題更成爲種種問題之重心。是以賠償問題也。戰債問題也。軍縮問題也。對俄問題也。乃至中日問題。均爲互相關聯之問題。非僅解决一端而遂可希冀全世界之平和焉。</p>
<p>夫洛桑條約之簽訂。誠可視爲解决賠償問題之方策。然其實行。旣須視美國之態度而定。而美國之態度。又須視十一月間美國總統選舉之結果而取决。故繼洛桑會議而召集之世界經濟會議。必俟美國總統選舉而後始行召集。是美國與歐洲諸重要問題。實有重要之關繋也。</p>
<p>國際聯盟對於解决中日事件之掙扎。不可謂不久。最近調查團復齎其調查將及一年之報告書遄返日内瓦。定於十一月間之國際大會提出討論。報告書之内容。吾人固無由深悉。但若於日本不利。則必遭日本强烈之反對。可無疑義。而日本一加反對。國聯必致束手無策。亦吾人所能意料者也。</p>
<p>軍縮大會之結果。爲幾條空洞之决議案。其中比較重要者。僅美總統所提之普縮三分之一之一案。此案如不能得各國之同意。則美國之減輕戰債。終難如望。而洛桑會議之成效。將等於零。至於最近德國要求軍備平等問題。尤爲軍縮問題之重大難關。德國聲稱如此項要求不能满足。則將退出國聯。然而法國則方力斥德人之蔑視條約。兩國之意見。殊納鑿也。</p>
<p>最後則爲對俄問題。近時日俄形勢緊張之電訊。雖時時接觸於吾人眼簾。惟此决非日俄二國之問題。而爲全世界資本主義國家對共産主義國家之問題。在對俄聯合戰線尚未成立以前。决無發動戰事之可能。故對俄問題之解决。恐將在其餘各問題獲有相當妥協之後。而爲各問題總解决中最後解决之問題。</p>
<p>總之全世界各國。今正在準備解决歷久未决。之問題。在最近之將來。國聯大會將謀中日問題之解决。軍縮會議將謀世界平和之增進。世界經濟會議。將謀世界恐慌之挽救。此種種會議。一俟美國總統選舉以後。在日内瓦次第舉行。然能否成功。尚屬絕大疑問。假。使此種會議。各有相當之成就。則苟安之局。尚可維持。而不然者。惟有將此一篇糊塗帳目全行撕破。準備武力。作大規模之厮殺而已。國人於此世界緊急關頭。其將持觀望之態度。死心塌地坐以待斃乎。抑及時準備。在列强衝突之中。努力自救。闢一光明之血路乎。是在國人之自决。</p>

<p>節譯日本對世界戰爭</p>
<p>丨外部軍部思想矛盾丨</p>
<p>丨陷於與世界爲敵之苦境丨</p>
<p>满洲事變突發時、外部軍部相聚而言曰、「可惜早了二三年」、推其意、蓋謂動手過</p>
<p>早、準備尚未齊全、是則我所引爲遺憾者也、</p>
<p>雖然、此非指軍部言也、軍部於三四年前、早已準備齊全、當張作霖逃出關外</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>時、軍部即有躍躍欲試之勢、故彼等於重大時機之到來、祇嫌其遲、决無嫌其太早之理、又况國外有軍縮會議之切迫、國内有陸軍縮少之輿論、列强之疲弊、大有可乘、美國之海軍、毫不足畏、種種理由、不勝縷指、深足以激動彼等之雄心乎、然則所謂準備未齊全者何也、蓋指外交而言、指政府之不能統制外部軍部及國論而言、換言之、則外部旣無解决满蒙問題之妙計、外部軍部、思想各别、政府亦無統一之智勇、遂致日本進退維谷、陷於與世界爲敵之苦境而急切不能自拔、</p>
<p>請先言外部之思想、外部以爲尚力時代、已成過去、今後與其尊尚武力、毋寗依賴法律之力、國際輿論之力、以期國際互相協調、較爲有利、故除中國公然以武力挑戰外、决不可自已退回尚力主義路上、此幣原式外交主義之思想也、欲知幣原式外交主義、何以有此思想、則不可不顧歐洲大戰之教訓、當歐戰前、列强率取尚力主義、依武力而興、依武力而稱覇於世界、不獨一德意志然也、即英吉利、亦嘗以其强大海軍、誇耀於世界各國、然而此等思想、皆因歐戰而打成粉碎、</p>
<p>第一、戰爭之性質全變也、昔日之戰爭、不過兵與兵戰、今日之戰爭、則爲全體國民之奮鬥、而物質·道德·經濟·無一不隨之而破壞、第二·戰勝國亦與戰敗國、同感苦痛、同歸疲弊、欲依戰勝而發揚國威、增大民福、不但萬不可能、并有與之俱盡之勢、</p>
<p>此種事實、因歐戰之巨大犧牲、德意志首先覺悟、歐洲諸國次第覺悟、尋至全世界亦無不覺悟、其結果、大家覺悟武力主義之不可恃、於是國際協調主義、共存共榮主義、勃然興起、欲順風揚帆、乘世界潮流以達彼岸者、正幣原外交派思想之所寄托也、</p>
<p>要之、幣原外交、爲國際協調主義、國際聯盟主義、非武力主義、對中國則取親善主義、共存共榮主義、其大較也、然初非任人蹴踏、毫不抵抗也、其所以不贊成用兵者、則因满蒙問題、不僅中日兩國問題、實爲關係全世界之大問題、非周圍事情、皆能於我有利、决不可輕舉妄動、英美於满事突發前、二三年間、特别與我表示好意、其關鍵即在乎此、所可惜者、旣未能將我在满蒙之特殊情形、使列强予以諒解、又無打勝困難之妙計、俾中日能相安無事、以致釀成一發難收局面、此則幣原外交派、所應負責者耳、</p>
<p>與幣原式國際協調主義相對立者、爲軍部之尚力主義、彼等以爲正義·人道·和平·非戰·皆不過僞善者哄人之假面具、結局唯有武力二字、方是貨眞價實、絕無虚假、依彼等之說、國際關係上最重要者、爲國家利害之衝突、一有衝突、即易傾向於互相攻撃、斯時非有軍備、不能隨時抑止、使不破裂、尋其意味、蓋謂維持和平、與正義人道等無涉、祇有兵力、能確保之、直認軍備爲和平之保障矣、</p>
<p>彼則彼等對於满蒙問題、果抱如何之思想乎、我國有一種志士論客、常喜高唱满蒙割取論、今即如其所說、謂满蒙非中國本土、但憑空昌言割取、獨不違犯九國條約非戰條約乎、斯又無從强辯者也、於此一點、我軍部似亦承認、故軍部對於满蒙、始終不敢主張割取之暴論、</p>
<p>曾記荒本陸相、有一次在東京朝日新聞、發表意見、大意謂維持極東和平、爲日本之天職、有攪亂極東和平者、不問其爲中國或他國、皆非討伐不可、日人若缺乏此種信念與意氣、即將爲中國或他國所侮辱、不啻在全國世界面前、廿心自居被告地位、此種言論、固不可與德國派之軍國主義等量齊觀、然指爲尚力主義之一種表現、恐亦無以自解也、</p>

<p>昨以直落三淘汰葡萄牙</p>
<p>已定本星期日與英决賽</p>
<p>羅伯杯國際網球雙打、昨日中華對葡萄牙在中華網球場舉行複賽、雖售門票每位六角、觀衆仍達六七百人、中華選手邱飛海林寳華、以六比一、八比六、六比四、淘汰葡萄牙卡那凡洛與Ｈ柯拉沙、中華遂得决賽權、已定本星期日對英國組在法商總會决賽、羅伯杯之形勢及昨日比賽經過如下、</p>
<p>美國　葡萄牙　三比０葡　中華　三比０中　德國　英國　三比０英　星期日决賽</p>
<p>邱林開始極順利　中華林寳華發球開始、球重如砲彈、每奏奇功、加以邱飛海攔網之包迫、集中於柯拉沙進攻、柯氏與卡那凡洛雖穩健耐戰、卒無所建樹、中華連勝四局後、葡萄牙方得一局、是盤結果、中華組以六比一勝、極爲容易、</p>
<p>葡選手集注一方　邱林二選手之雙打、均善於右場、而非左塲之能手、葡選手察覺弱點之所在、乃集注於左塲攻撃、其勢甚猛、故是盤頓成緊張之勢、葡萄牙並常用高球襲撃林邱之後方、但得失均衡、先由葡萄牙以二比一局估優、林邱連加兩局後、局勢乃爲之一變、但葡萄牙亦加兩局、成四比三、林邱落後、旣又成五比四、五比五、及六比五、葡選手節節爭先、大有一氣呵成之勢、林邱乃謹愼抵抗、攔網極有功夫、葡選手又展故技、冀用高球撃林邱後方、但多出界、遂成六比六、林邱旣奪此關、精神爲之一振、連勝兩局、而以八比六結束、</p>
<p>精彩表演竟全功　第三盤競爭最見精彩、卡那凡洛發球、極有孤性、林邱連抽四記、均出界外、葡乃得第一局、邱以發球軟弱、又失一局、幸卽勝回兩局、卡那凡洛發球、林邱又連負四球、葡選手又比三比二局勝、成三比三後、林邱乃佔前矛、第八局上、競爭殊烈、平手者凡七八次、或短兵相接、或長槍挑戰、葡選手時以高球還送、林邱則以高壓敬之、局勢緊張、互有得失、卡那凡洛集中左塲攔網、每奏勝數、但林之發球、亦爲對手之大患、邱之擱網、每多巧作、是局結果、仍歸林邱、後各增一局、成六比四、林邱竟全功、</p>
<p>星期日中英决賽　中華自淘汰葡萄牙後、乃獲與英國之决賽權、林邱二人雖如錦上添花、珠聯璧合之配搭、但英國選手德孚與惠特均雙打之名將、殊爲强勁、本星期日兩組在法商總會之决賽、林邱實未許參觀</p>

<p>駐外領事簽發運貨證條例、自經我海關於九月一日、佈告實施以來、各旅滬外商、均無反對之表示、惟日商則仍在積極反對中、並謬舉五點、爲反對之理由、各項詳情、分誌於後、</p>
<p>要求日使交涉　日工商同志會·各路商聯會·紡織聯合會·等各商業團體、爲反對我國府公佈實施之領事簽證制問題、曾連日召開會議、討論應付辦法、自新任駐華公使有吉抵滬後、進行更見活躍、並曾於有吉抵滬之翌日、由居留民團代理行政委員長安井·各路商聯會副會長井町·等、（因正會長林吉雄在日尚未返）代表旅滬全體日商、面謁有吉、要求向我提出此項廢止領事簽證制之交涉、結果如何、因内容秘密、無從探悉、</p>
<p>日商反對理由　日商連日會議之結果、已决定以下列五點、爲反對之理由（一）手續麻煩、妨礙對華貿易、（二）該項制度、爲抵制日貨之一種手段、（三）簽證費過多、日商負擔過重、（四）該項制度、實際上爲變相的增高關稅、（五）中國駐外領</p>

<p>聯絡外商失敗　在本埠海關尚未公佈實行駐外領事簽證制之前、旅滬日商、即已有顯明之反對、且更發表告友邦僑商書、希圖聯絡各友邦商人、取一致反對行動、惟各外商對於我方此項新制度、咸認爲理由充足、且關稅業經自主、更無反對之餘地、故均拒絕日方游詞、而遵照新制辦理、聞日來日商因鑒於此項計劃、已全盤失敗、業已决定取單獨行動、以圖最後掙扎、</p>
<p>抗議設立分館　我外交部自領事簽證制、於九月一日公佈設立領事分館、或辦事處、以求辦事敏捷、日本之大阪·神户·台灣·等地、亦經我外部先後派員籌設分館、現均宣告成立、開始簽發運貨證單、惟日政府竟藉口以我外部在上列各地設立分館、事前未曾徵得日方同意、而擬令外務省、向我提出抗議、要求撤消、並聞此項主張、亦係上海日商向該國政府貢獻之意見云、</p>
<p>各地代表來滬　津·青·平·各地日商業團體、爲集議妥善辦法、反對我方施行之領事簽證制問題起見、業經推派代表來滬協商一切、本埠日商業團體、於各地代表到達後、將定期召開一「各地日商代表聯席會議」、詳細討論辦法云、</p>

<p>大公社云、徐重道全體職工、自宣告總罷工後、前日經黨部代表、再三勸導後、决定昨晨八時半一律復工、但資方臨時欲開除此次指使罷工主動人物、以致又起波折、</p>
<p>復工情形　全體職工昨晨八時一律、分赴總支各店、照常工作、詎資方在總店内、貼示佈告、須開除此次主使罷工首領岑永康·周剛鍾吉人·楊錫奎·邵秉相·孫正奎·等六人、以致引起全體職工不满、當由小組代表鍾吉人·楊錫奎·等、往藥業工會請求交涉、經工會召開理監事緊急會議議决、分赴黨政機關請願、</p>

<p>船身未損乘客無恙</p>
<p>太古公司南華班輪綏陽號、本月七日下午、由滬赴青島、在光華碼頭裝火油時、發見第三艙内失愼、焚毁貨物一批、該輪退還上海、情形查報如下、</p>
<p>開往青島綏陽輪由香港廣東來滬、於本月四日進口、卸去貨件後、即停泊浦東華通碼頭、至七日就浦東裝載出口貨、開往青島、此次該輪運赴膠澳貨件、以洋紙茶葉等項居多、七日下午二時裝齊、即開赴高樓沙光華火油棧碼頭、加運煤油至青島、</p>
<p>三艙起火　下午四時左右、綏陽輪駛抵光華碼頭、靠泊之後、便啓艙裝油、詎第三艙開出、艙内火熖冒出、已經失愼燒着、一經艙門開洩、空氣流通、而火勢乃突然冒出艙面、船主巴倫、立即命全體水手、及碼頭小工等協助、用船上自備之救火器具、極力施救、無如該艙所裝以紙頭居多、火勢頗烈、不易撲滅、</p>
<p>海關援救　船主因火勢至烈、不易救滅、乃懸旂告警、以海關得報、急派救火小輪及消防人員、駛往助救、而救火會亦派救火車到來、協助射水、至五時許、方將第三艙火勢撲滅、起火原因、迄未得知、大約小工裝貨時、遺留紙烟頭餘火所起、太古公司、亦派員到輪視察、</p>
<p>開回上海　船内之火救熄後、因被焚貨件、及受水漬之貨、須起卸至碼頭、請公正人估騐數目等等、故綏陽輪不能再開到青島、由太古公司命其駛還上海、仍停浦東華通碼頭、查第三艙内共載貨物二千七百餘件、中以紙頭居多、茶葉亦有、昨日已在將燒壞之紙張等卸上碼頭、而水漬貨中之茶葉、損失尚微、仍可由原船運出、</p>
<p>損失一斑　此次被燒之貨、損失頗大、現在由太古通知各客家、先辦攤水、其損害數目、尚須查明估計、方能得悉、刻猶未知、船身未曾損壞、但須加以整理、故展延至十　日出口、當失火時、船内旅客、因靠停碼頭、而又在下午、故均得安全上陸、於撲滅餘燼後、再行下船、故亦無驚慌也、</p>

<p>相老人主張用天條十誡，不自國難時期始：一九一</p>
<p>六年五月七日國恥紀念日，在北京中央公園，也講演過。兹特節抄數節，僅示内容一斑。</p>
<p>現在談第六誡，毋邪淫：即現在最難解决的婚姻問題　「配爲夫婦，乃白頭偕老終身之約，倘中道相捐，直捷對於人類，是犯不忠不信不仁不義，莫大的罪過：故因犯姦，亦只好分房異寢而已。」</p>
<p>「我國亦知男女居室，人之大倫。大倫，豈可朝更暮改的　？亦知夫婦無别，則近於禽獸；然而宜男之婦，有借於朋友，而傳爲美談者矣！人人說：萬惡淫爲首：至於看淫戲，看淫書，反以爲消遣。孰知新學家，則别開生面，說人類本是禽獸，何必拘拘禮法：這不是我國簇簇新新的現狀麽？」</p>
<p>「諸君意見，以爲該維持不維持？」</p>
<p>「史傳所載，報紙所登，古與今莫不皆然，可見女寗被殺，不願被淫；然則多淫一女，不啻多殺一人。人或美其名曰「納寵」寵在那兒？寵你臭皮囊，臭淫欲而已！藉曰寵姬寵妾，其實是奪其自由，毁其人格，喪其羞恥，滅其靈光。你說我拿錢買的，難道人是可賣品麽？」</p>
<p>「馬竇經說：凡人引誘年青子女，倒不如拿磨盤石，奪他頸項旗沉他海底！就如說其人之惡，不可令居地面上！</p>

<p>— 白·石·</p>
<p>丨老牌少丨冒牌多丨</p>
<p>所謂上海人，實際不是上海人。眞正的上海人，呌做本地人。本地人在上海的人口中，雖然未有正確的統計，依了普通的估計，恐怕最多也不過佔到百分之十。其餘的百分之九十，雖然其中廣東人，寗波人，山東人，江北人，以及其餘邊疆遠省的人，應有盡有，但是他們却没有不以上海人自命的。所以你遇到一個上海話　句不會說的客民，儘恭維他是「上海人」，準不會錯。　　上海因了這五方雜處的關係，「上海話」也跟着「上海人」而大受影響。「本地人」說的上海話，其實倒是不折不扣的「上海話」，但是「上海人」偏要硬說本地人說的是浦東話。用各處方言雜凑成功的，才算「上海話」。例如說「我」，須學寗波人說「阿拉」；「你」，須學本地人說「儂」：「他」，須學蘇州人說「俚」；「好」，須學廣東人說「頂括括」；「不好」，須學北方人說「不興」：表示驚訝而失望，須學江北人說，「乖乖不得了」。倘使你的話，能夠這樣子不三不四的東學一句，西學一句，那人家就心悅誠服，而且五體投地的佩服你是一位貨眞價實的「老上海」。</p>
<p>「上海人」的心目中，似乎以爲上海人是另一個民族。凡是不會說這種夾七夾八「上海話」的人，統稱之爲「鄕下人」，而鄕下人的代名詞，上等的呌做「阿木林」下等的呌做「屈死」。其實今日的「上海」也到找不到一片城磚兒，而今日的租界，正是從前的上海的「鄕下」。現</p>
<p>在自命爲老牌上海人，實際上倒是道地的鄕下人。上海人所說的鄕下人，或許倒是新從城圈兒再來的呢。</p>

<p>丨出路　錢·爭利丨</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在這樣不景氣的社會中·简直是一切都無從談起！把青年種種問題來論·求學·婚姻·謀身以及其他，要得到一個相當圓满的解决，雖費了九牛二虎之力，然還是没有把握，還是失敗的多而成功者少！爲了社會的不景氣，確能影響到個人的人生觀；没有智識的人固然感得痛苦，然有了智識是更痛苦。所以，在現下，祇有這個辦法，就是有一天總去努力一天，不管它是難問題，也不管它是不景氣。這樣，也許能去找條出路！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>求學要錢，婚姻也要錢，謀身何嘗不要錢！一切的一切，都要錢，原是非錢不行。在這個經濟制度下的社會，錢的力量高於一切，那是當然的丨「家徒四壁」與「金屋藏嬌」之相差，也不過是錢的數量而已！這是可以整個地象徵了現社會。因之，有錢者是有求必應，無錢者是免開尊口！所以，勸奉足下，對於錢的一道，該得去探討探討，有了錢究竟是便宜得多呢。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>社會雖是不景氣，然研究「經濟學」的先生們和小姐們，倒是爭先恐後，上自元首，下至黎民，莫不熱心從事，這種精神，本來是好現象，但是孟老夫子曾說過「上下交爭利，而國危矣！」照例，應該說得現代熱心於「經濟學」的人們要有些「退避三舍」，但事實上却是不然，見利勇爲，上行下效，還是爭先恐後：至於國家安危，似乎是另一問題！好了，這種倘是亡國滅種的現象，試問是什麽？</p>

<p>王先生，煩你照管照管我的家屋，我出去買一些東西便回來。芬若說。</p>
<p>「你買什麽東西？今天是紀念碑落成禮，街上各店都休業半天呢。」王先生說。</p>
<p>「伊愛吃瓜，吃了瓜，心神凉些，也許病可以好些，這是伊的習慣；並且順便想去找一找唐醫生，請他來給伊打一針，這幾天我身體也不很健，伊要是瘋這麽幾天，我便受不住」</p>
<p>「張醫生怕不在家？鎭上什麽人都去參加這落成禮了。但是你要瓜的話，買是準買不到，我家裏遠留着兩個挺大挺大的雪瓤西瓜，待我回去捧來給伊吃吧。」</p>
<p>「也好，謝謝你啦！但是，我該償還你瓜價。」</p>
<p>「我們相識了這麽幾天，難道這兩個西瓜的交情都没有？嫂子！你太認眞啦。」王先生說着，便穿了長衫出門而去。</p>
<p>隔不上十分鐘，芬若正在樓上服侍袁瘋子解小溲完畢，有人在樓下敲門。</p>
<p>「王先生！你跑得怎快？」芬若一壁開門，一壁嘴裏在歡迎王先生。</p>
<p>「呀！是你？」芬若萬萬料不到貴人降臨，更猜不出一别十餘年的他，已變成了全國所崇拜的民族英雄，究竟伊自已還是一個幻覺，抑是做夢？在伊開了門以後，突然瞧見一個軍官，很和藹地走進來的時候。</p>
<p>「芬若，我的芬若，我還是我，你當然還不致完全忘掉你的老友。但是，今天我太來得奇特，確是出乎你意料之外。」袁團長把門關上，走到堂屋裏去，而芬若也跟了進來。</p>
<p>「那麽請坐袁團長！」芬若倒了一杯茶給他。</p>
<p>「你應該不致忘掉我的名字吧？芬若！」</p>
<p>「是，袁人楷先生！我在報紙上早已讀到你的大名，像你這樣一個英雄，我怎麽敢直呼姓名呢。」</p>
<p>「你應該不致忘掉我的舊名字吧？我的芬若」</p>
<p>「請你讓我稱你袁人楷先生；否則便稱你做袁團長！十餘年前的事，何必多耗腦力去想它。今天這鎭上，爲了你的功勛，建築一座紀念碑，等着你去行落成典禮，怎麽還不去，大家正等着你呢。」芬若很莊重地催促着袁團長走。</p>
<p>「這樣難得的機會，也不讓我多坐一會？」</p>
<p>「咳！你前程遠大，孀婦的家裏，不宜多坐；生怕被新聞記者知道了，回去記載着，又是整整地一大版，你自愛些吧！雖然我也上了年紀，兩鬢都霜白了。」</p>

<p>前低後高　昨標金前仆後起，盤旋於七百兩前後、終日有七兩餘廻顧、統核續漲四兩有零、人心轉萎爲强、初開略跌、廣帮恒有購買、且中央銀行賡續吸收現貨、金價遂見上乘、復以外電有免償戰債之訊、市面稍挫、後市突傳國際經濟會議有緩期之說、買氣蓬勃、飛漲五六兩、至英美兩滙殆亦俏利、同業向結不怠、最後計爲七百０七兩光景、兹查中央銀行買進現貨共計三百餘條、價爲七百０三兩半至二兩二錢五係由泰康潤等經售、今天大條銀定有再跌可能、兹錄統日情况於后、</p>
<p>早開低盤　自晨十月期開盤、即小去一兩九錢、爲七百兩００五錢、次爲六百九十九兩八錢　繼因同太昌買進、當卽上升一兩餘、丙興元興永等來售、立退至七百兩關口、一刹時買户活動、金價滙市亦俏、金價提高二兩餘、九點半先令揭佈勿更、旋後漲爲０二兩八錢、入後回落三兩零、惟有數錢上下、十點零爲六百九十九兩半、頃由兆豐昌等來進、十點五十餘分爲七百０一兩八錢、忽聞經濟會議有取銷戰債之說、志豐永等傾賣不鮮、十一點二十餘分爲六百九十九兩三錢、移時丙興等爭購、尤以中央又開現貨一百０五條、十一點三刻爲０一兩四錢、繼則抑至０六錢、午收０一兩三錢、</p>
<p>後市陡健　後市初開０一兩、繼有數錢上落、嗣則平和、不過數錢高低、直至三點一刻後突呈堅俏、恒餘等上場競購、實因傳說經濟會議未能如期而開、有展期消息、金價飛漲六兩餘、三點三刻爲０六兩七錢、然大德成等等此而售、遂退至０五兩六錢、四點零爲０六兩六錢、復以同太昌等售出、退落一兩、最後仍向前進、迨四點三十分收市爲０六兩半、比前午續漲四兩一錢、重又抬至０七兩以上、查當日最大價爲七百０六兩七錢、最小價六百九十九兩三錢、相差七兩四錢、赤條計加九兩五錢、揭價仍爲七百六十八兩、計撳六十六七兩至六十五兩、後爲六十九兩、午收六十七兩　下午六十七八兩至六十一兩、較前午少撳五兩、登賬補水前市七百０一兩、後市０七兩、有雙結價之舉、</p>
<p>交易敏活　檯面上交易、甚爲敏活、統計元茂永·益豐·恒興·同太昌·等進、益餘·元大永·義豐永·兆豐昌出多入少、萬興·順利·信昌進多出少、午後同太昌·順利·元大永·元茂永等均出·志豐永·福餘·恒餘等都進、</p>

<p>昨銀市以迭長多日之反向而縮、匯兌仍漲不已、至於本埠匯市趨緊、匯豐掛牌僅法印長四元、德匯加半馬克、坡洋加五錢、餘無升降、殆内部英金尤挺、結果比前午縮一二五、美金因軋大匯兌、祇縮一二五、惟終日略有盤旋、而金市前跌後漲、華商各號交易頗形活躍、計英金成交五六萬鎊、又沙遜洋行亦購去十一月份美金、共計七八十萬元、金業中及廣帮生大等均向扒結抵空、惟抛出者亦屬不鮮、大致均套標金、美銀公司亦有買進、孟買則電售十月份、而市况呈盤旋之勢、預料英美銀市、或有續縮之可能、</p>
<p>英匯　内盤全日計有一二五參差、自晨開賣價九月一先令九便士六二五、十月六八七五、十一月七五、十二月八一二五、買價各月照加一二五、午收出價九便士六八七五至八七五、進價七五至九三七五、下午收市出價九便士五六二五至八一二五、進價六二五至八七五、</p>

<p>昨日市場中氣象、比較前日趨勢略覺優越、緣銀行購洋亦有見聞、而銀洋兩種欵項收解亦不若前日之冷淡、雖不能謂爲繁旺、然而差强人意、惟其銀根之不易堅挺、良亦爲用途稀少、頭櫬充裕之故、苟銀錢業能以俟市而寛寗而轉機、則需要當可活動也、</p>
<p>厘忽轉高拆市如舊　「洋厘」早市厘價、本已較前日加昻三毫七忽半、而午市則又加漲二毫半、計早市爲六錢九分０七毫半、午市爲六錢九分一厘、結果共漲六毫二忽半、「銀拆」早午市銀拆價格、仍復開做六分、與前日完全相同、劃頭加水五六分、較遜一二分、銀根形勢仍無轉昻餘地、</p>
<p>輔幣江角跌廣角漲　江南小洋、賡續盤低、早市爲五錢九分七釐、午市爲五錢九分六厘半、結果小一厘半、交易早市五千角、午市三千角、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢八分六厘三毫七忽半、午市爲五錢八分六厘、結果較昻二毫半、做出交易、早市九萬角、午市四萬五千角、銅元回縮五百文、爲四百三十一千五百文、交易四萬八千七百五十九千五百文、計銀欵一萬一千三百兩、</p>
<p>銀洋收解交易適度　「銀欵」昨日銀行收解雖不繁盛、而較前日轉覺差勝、計華商收解票欵二百二三十萬、外商收解票欵一百七八十萬、特欵收解二百餘萬電滙欵五十萬、各種貨滙稅雜諸收解八百餘萬、押欵交易一百餘萬、進倉五十萬、出倉六十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千七百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百二十餘萬、各路滙欵收解六十餘萬、收現三十餘萬、「洋欵」滙劃票欵早市做出六十三萬、午市僅二十六萬五千、鈔票早市四萬五千、午市二萬、場外鈔票、早市十一萬五千、午市七萬、銀行支單、早市五萬、午市三萬、照市加二毫半、銀行買賣、早市互市五十五萬、午市三十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百三十餘萬、鈔票進出二百十餘萬、洋押欵交易七十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百八十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、</p>

<p>昨（八日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現貨雖有數種開出、成交極稀、合祇七千元、期貨十月期仍毫無交易、九月期比前日雖稍多、而市面依然不振、計上午交易祇七十萬元、後市則有一百二十餘萬、上午求供極稀、市面甚平、毫無變化、後市因有零星吸進、價徘徊稍漲、結果除鹽稅一九關現貨略疲外、餘各漲起三四角左右、但以環象仍無新發展、大户觀望如前、各債劵趨勢依然呆滯云、</p>

<h3 id="c201">鄭繼成果有罪乎？ <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>殺人者死，原是刑法上一種最公平的原則，無論古今中外，没有異議，但是爲什麽而殺人？爲什麽而被人所殺？其中自有原因，應當判别，不能不審察其情理，考究其事實而貿然概以殺人者死爲定讞也，</p>
<p>此次張宗昌在濟南車站，被鄭繼成刺死，則鄭似有應得之罪，但是張宗昌在魯時，禍魯罪惡，彰明較著，國府通緝令，至今并未取消，山東省府在泰安時，亦曾懸賞五萬元，通緝有案，是張宗昌對於中華民國，本有應得之罪，則此次鄭之殺張，實爲國家除害，非特無辜，且可蒙賞，則鄭之不應死者一也</p>
<p>又鄭繼成供，張宗昌如係兩軍陣前，將家叔殺死，是各爲其主，無話可說，但張係令姜明玉將家叔誘來濟南，慘殺後又懸賞三萬元，赴津捕余，兩次越墻倖免，是張宗昌不但殺其叔鄭金聲，并欲得鄭繼成除之而後快，則鄭之刺張，實出自衛，鄭不殺張，張將殺鄭，自衛又何罪焉，此鄭之不應死者二也，</p>
<p>蓋國家立法，窮理以定賞罰，本情以正褒貶，原不能以死板板的條文，而適用於千變萬化的事實，故現在所當研究者，張宗昌是否有罪，若張宗昌而果有罪，則鄭之殺張，認爲正當，不能以尋常殺人論之，若張宗昌無罪，則鄭之殺張，天然非法，殺人者死，無所逃於法之外也，</p>

<h3 id="c203">織物之印花法 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 芮·禹·成·</p>
<p>印花就是部分的染色，凡是人們所希求的花樣，使它顯現在布疋上：或是把已經染色的布疋，拔去其部分的染色，使它現出白色的花紋；都呌做印花。但是，印花的方法是怎樣呢？兹將各種要點分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）依染料的性質分别的：</p>
<p>（一）用黏糊拌入染料，使印着於布上的花紋部分：但有些染料，因它直接與纖維有親和的性質，所以單用染料，也能印上。</p>
<p>（二）同樣地用媒染染料，印在經過媒染劑的布疋上。</p>
<p>（三）先用後處理法發色的染料，印在布上再通過於處理浴中，使它發色。</p>
<p>（四）先將布疋染色，或經媒染，或經準備處理，再用藥品印上，使得部分脫色：或用不發色藥品印後，使它發色的。</p>
<p>（五）以受機械的部分不吸收色素的方法印之，再通過於染液或媒染液，使它發色。</p>
<p>（乙）依機械的設備分别的：</p>
<p>（一）用彫刻滾筒印花。</p>
<p>（二）用彫刻板印花（EngravedBlock）</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>以上均有凸凹兩種　　　　　　　　　（三）板押法：就是將布疋簸入兩塊已經彫刻的板裏，堅固　住，防止染液浸入。</p>
<p>（四）絞染法：用線　緊花紋處，以防染液浸入。</p>
<p>（五）刻成紙型，將染糊刷上；或用型紙，以防染糊刷上：再浸入染液中。或在已染布疋上，用型紙印以拔色糊而處理之。</p>
<p>（六）用繪畫法描染而成。</p>
<p>以上各種分類之外，若更以印染工程來分類，則又有下面的幾種方法：概依發色的方法分别的：</p>
<p>（一）顔料法（PigmentStyle）：這種顔料，不是染料能溶在水中而浸染的：就是繪畫用的顔料（Lake）拌入糊料，以印上布面：此法從前應用於洋標布爲重。</p>
<p>（二）直接印花法（DirectPrintingStyle）：用直接與纎維有親和力的染料，拌成適當糊狀而印之：此法應用於各種織物。</p>
<p>（三）蒸氣法（SteamStyle）：應用於媒染染料印花時，以媒染劑與染料混和印上，經過蒸氣後，兩者才能結合，染着布上。這種方法也可應用於各種織物，惟應用於鹽基性染料時，須加入單寗酸以固着之。若再用銻鹽類溶液，便更堅牢了。此法應用於植物纖維爲羅掘俱窮</p>
<p>古物出賣　雅片公賣　紙幣稅</p>
<p>主：同樣用顯色染料印花，後通過於駢困醇液，使它發色的，亦屬此種。</p>
<p>（四）染出法（MadderorDyedStyle）：用某種媒染劑印花後，再用媒染染料浸染，使該部分發色的。　　（五）防染法（ResistStyle）：以防着色或不使發色之物印花，後經過浸染或刷染，該部分除去或水洗後，現出白地或不染狀態的。</p>
<p>其中如施乙種駢困醇媒染的布上，覆以防染糊，使發色時得到防染的結果，呌做防染刷染法（ResistPadStyle）：印毛斯綸應用之。</p>
<p>（六）拔染法（DischargeStyle）：此法很是重要；已染色布，用拔色或褪色藥品印花，現出白地或拔染他色，這種方法多應用於各種纖維上。</p>
<p>近今隨化學的進步，除上述而外，還不時有發明别種新法來染色，奇花異樣，以投人們之慾望：據聞現在更有與織物組織相結合，製出格外美麗的花樣了。本來物質的文明，是無止境的啊！</p>

<h3 id="c204">關於吃飯問題之商榷 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 儔</p>
<p>改良吃飯問題　計有文君怡怡館主其行振正諸位先後在本刊發表許多很好意見，兹再立於經濟與衛生的原則上，略陳愚見，來同大家商榷一下：</p>
<p>一、分食合食問題</p>
<p>A合的得失　省事，便當，菜的樣數能多，易配各人口胃，這是合的好處，不衛生，易傳染，這是合的壞處，　　B分的得失　唯一好處，就是分食可避免直接間接的傳染病，然單調，麻煩，冬天易冷，三人以上就不易對口胃，這是分食很顯明的缺點，就作者所知，以前張默君氏長南京一女師校時，曾一度行分食制，未久仍行合食，郭鴻聲氏長南京高等師範時，行分食制頗久，即每餐每人一菜一湯或一葷一素，以特製之錫具中有一格者盛之，雖習之已久，仍多苦之者，然其時膳由校給，勉以衛生，亦各安之，	然自東大成立後，學生多自理膳食，此制即漸廢，於此可知分食實行之難，他若家庭實行分食者，尚無所聞，</p>
<p>C可行辦法　分食於習慣及經濟上旣有難行之處，如上述事實，而合食又有可怕弊害，愚意有一可行辦法，能得中西（即分合）之長，而無其弊，即每人備兩雙箸，兩匙，一碟或小盞，以備檢菜取湯時分用，其他全仍其舊，此舉其行君意見相同，本埠紅十字會總醫院醫師飯廳，即行此制，實無一毫難行之處，各種會社機關家庭，均可倣之實行，　　二　食物質料問題　飯的方面，確以麥食雜食爲好，惟在本埠，一時恐未易言，愚意早餐改爲每人食麵一碗，似能普行，近年同濟中公各大學學生包飯，早餐皆麵一碗，各地人都食，可以爲證，至於菜，以蔬菜多於葷菜爲好，以鮮多於醃爲好，愚意應請本埠衛生機關或醫學醫業團體，以經濟與衛生爲原則，爲我們製，食表，公佈出來，以資改進，至飲料，白開水最好，</p>
<p>三、碗碟匙箸之洗滌問題　這個問題爲改革吃飯問題之重心，每飯後，應專人負責或監督，必須用沸水洗滌！最好全放在鍋内煑沸過！否則傳染仍難免等於不改！</p>
<p>四、廚房中之擦布問題　傷寒，虎疲，痢疾等等兇症，微菌多能由菜塲菜蔬傳到廚房，由做菜人手上傳到擦布，由擦布傳到碗碟匙箸！再一來就到口裏了！務要特别注意！用過　洗凈還不夠，非煑沸不可！</p>

<h3 id="c205">飯堂内的一瞥 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 十·三·齡·童·</p>
<p>「今天小菜太不行了，怎樣下飯呢？」</p>
<p>在XX學校飯堂内的諠譁聲中，學生XXX在飯桌上說着，甲，就接着說道，「只要每人一毛錢，六人六毛，添上二碗菜，不是問題就解决了麽？」</p>
<p>呸！另一個胖子說「今天冰結漣錢也没有，天氣又熱，還要添菜？」</p>
<p>「那麽怎樣呢？没有小菜終不是生意經，」XX悲傷地說。</p>
<p>唔！一位羊頭軍師隔了一會才說，「誰去捉一個蒼蠅來？等小菜快吃完再把蒼蠅朝碗底一去，再向廚房裏去興問罪之師，就得啦！」</p>
<p>於是XX满面笑容，怱怱地跑了出去，不一會拿了一只進來（來歷不明或須是在屎坑裏的）交給軍師。</p>
<p>如此丨這般丨交涉辦妥。</p>
<p>五分鐘後，廚司盛了一碗熱騰騰的菜進來了，别桌的人看見了，涎長三尺於XX就說。</p>
<p>「果然名不虚傳，不愧是個羊國韓信。」</p>

<h3 id="c206">要做過房娘 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 周··</p>
<p>對面隣舍這幾天老是在相駡，打聽下來，原來開玩笑弄假成了眞，這眞是庸人擾呢！</p>
<p>住在亭子間裏的嫂嫂，近日剛從鄕下出來，和客堂樓上的二房東娘娘，談白相談起了她在鄕下認過房娘的事，那位二房東娘娘，聽了不由得心動起來，她本來是喜歡搭訕的，於是笑嘻嘻對亭子間裏的嫂嫂說，好的，你在鄕下認了過房娘，在上海也認一個罷，就認子我做過房娘好勿好，</p>
<p>亭子間裏的嫂嫂，曉得她搭搭訕罷了，就也笑咪咪佯諾了，可是二房東娘娘却認眞了，老實不客氣的呌起乖寳寳，好心肝來，並且要她擇日正式拜過房娘，這一來亭子間裏的嫂嫂窘了，因爲事實上做不到的，本來在年齡上做過房娘總要大一點，現在反而比過房女兒小十幾歲，這樣顚倒的認親，眞是大笑話呢？但是房東娘娘不放你過門，這事情爲難了，虧得亭子間裏的嫂嫂也想得明白，「呌人勿蝕本，舌頭上打一個滾，」旣然心心願願要做過房娘，我就認了你，果然在一個日子，照例同乾兒女拜乾爺娘一樣的行一回禮，事情自然滑稽得像舞台的戲劇一般！</p>
<p>但是過房娘須有過房娘的名分，好得這位房東娘娘有的是錢，償了見面錢後，還很豐富的備了一席酒筵請過房媛，這時候，誰都感着歡喜，可是糟的事情，也就在以後，</p>
<p>因爲照習慣，做過房媛的也須備一席菜還敬過房娘，但是亭子間裏的嫂嫂，是没有閑錢多的，不能豐富地請客，只允許將拿到的見面錢四元，辦一桌和菜了事，其奈過房娘不答應，一定要同樣十幾塊錢辦一席，於是事情弄糟了，卒至反起目來，就顧不得過房娘和過房媛，大家都破口相駡了，徧徧二個都是寗波人，喉嚨特别響亮，駡人的藝術特别高明，致閙得震動了全弄堂，</p>
<p>現在傳說，亭子間裏的嫂嫂，準定明朝早晨再搬了，因爲接連吵了三日，再也合住不下去嘞，</p>
<p>唉！安安穩穩的日子勿要過，尋點事體出來閙閙，這眞是何苦來呢？啊！這種事體，祇有上海弄堂裏做得出來·</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Time for Final Reckoning of International Problems is Nigh <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Judging from the current situation in various aspects, it appears that this year will be a time for a final reckoning of the confused accounts of the past decade or more for the entire world. If this confused accounting can be properly rectified, the current chaotic situation may be temporarily managed. However, if it cannot be rectified, the outbreak of a second world war may be imminent. This is not a deliberately alarming statement, but is based on various facts that tell us so.</p>
<p>The factors that have plunged the world into an unmanageable state of chaos are certainly numerous. But to cite the most prominent, in economic terms, they are the reparations issue and the war debt issue; in political terms, they are the disarmament issue, the Russian issue, and the increasingly tense Sino-Japanese issue. All these issues may seem independent on the surface, like horses and cattle that have nothing to do with each other. In reality, they are interconnected. If one issue cannot be resolved, the remaining issues will be affected and rendered powerless.</p>
<p>Hasn't the Lausanne Conference already decided on a way to resolve the reparations issue? German reparations have been greatly reduced. However, the reduction of reparations must wait for the United States to agree to reduce war debts before it can be implemented. And according to Hoover's proposal on U.S. war debts, it must wait for all countries to agree to reduce armaments by one-third. At the same time, France believes that to reduce armaments, France must first have security guarantees. France's so-called security guarantee is to unite internationally to suppress Germany, and to adhere to the sacred Treaty of Versailles to prevent Germany's resurgence. However, this is unacceptable to Germany, and because it would hinder world peace, it is also unacceptable to European and American countries.</p>
<p>Because France is in an isolated position in Europe, it has to seek allies to increase its support while seeking to connect with strong countries in East Asia to contain Europe and America. As a result, Japan has been able to take advantage of this opportunity to carry out its long-planned Manchurian policy. This is why the Sino-Japanese issue is becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>Japan's Manchurian policy is deeply resented by Britain and the United States. However, initially, because of the common front against Russia, they did not dare to openly break with Japan. Therefore, the Russian issue has become the focus of all issues. Therefore, the reparations issue, the war debt issue, the disarmament issue, the Russian issue, and even the Sino-Japanese issue are all interconnected. It is not possible to hope for world peace by resolving only one issue.</p>
<p>The signing of the Lausanne Treaty can indeed be seen as a solution to the reparations issue. However, its implementation depends on the attitude of the United States, and the attitude of the United States depends on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November. Therefore, the World Economic Conference, which follows the Lausanne Conference, will be convened only after the U.S. presidential election. Therefore, the United States has important connections with major European issues.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' struggle to resolve the Sino-Japanese incident cannot be said to be short. Recently, the investigation team returned to Geneva with its nearly year-long investigation report, which is scheduled to be presented for discussion at the International Assembly in November. We have no way of knowing the contents of the report in detail. However, if it is unfavorable to Japan, it will inevitably be strongly opposed by Japan. This is beyond doubt. And once Japan objects, the League of Nations will be helpless. That is something we can anticipate.</p>
<p>The result of the disarmament conference was several empty resolutions. Among them, the most important is the U.S. President's proposal to reduce armaments by one-third. If this proposal cannot be agreed upon by all countries, it will be difficult for the United States to reduce war debts as hoped, and the effectiveness of the Lausanne Conference will be equal to zero. As for Germany's recent demand for equality in armaments, it is a major obstacle to the disarmament issue. Germany claims that if this demand cannot be met, it will withdraw from the League of Nations. However, France is strongly criticizing the Germans for disregarding the treaty. The opinions of the two countries are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Russian issue. Although news of the tense situation between Japan and Russia is frequently seen, this is by no means just a problem between Japan and Russia, but a problem between capitalist countries around the world and communist countries. Before a united front against Russia is established, it is impossible to launch a war. Therefore, the resolution of the Russian issue will probably be the last issue to be resolved in the overall resolution of all issues, after the other issues have reached a considerable compromise.</p>
<p>In short, countries around the world are now preparing to resolve long-standing issues. In the near future, the League of Nations General Assembly will seek to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue, the Disarmament Conference will seek to promote world peace, and the World Economic Conference will seek to save the world from panic. These various conferences will be held one after another in Geneva after the U.S. presidential election. However, whether they will be successful is still a big question. If these conferences each achieve considerable success, then the situation of temporary peace can still be maintained. Otherwise, the only option is to tear up this confused accounting and prepare for armed force and large-scale fighting. At this critical juncture in the world, will the Chinese people adopt a wait-and-see attitude and sit still and wait for death? Or will they prepare in time and strive to save themselves amidst the conflict of the great powers, and open up a bright path of blood? This is up to the self-determination of the Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e2">National Salvation Army Occupies Seven Counties in Eastern Jilin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Wang Delin Incorporates Righteous Armies from Antu, Changbai, and Other Counties</p>
<p>Xiaobai Mountain and Longtan Mountain All Occupied by National Salvation Army</p>
<p>Righteous Army Surrounds Yongji City and Engages in Artillery Battle with Japanese Army</p>
<p>(Beiping) The seven counties of Hunchun, Wangqing, Dunhua, Helong, Ning'an, Dongning, and Muling in eastern Jilin have all been occupied by the National Salvation Army. Of the eight counties in eastern Jilin, only Yanji is in the hands of the Japanese army. Wang Delin has already sent people to incorporate the righteous armies from Antu, Changbai, and other counties in the border area. The current organization of the National Salvation Army includes eight infantry brigades, three cavalry regiments (with over 4,000 horses), two artillery regiments, two mortar battalions, two machine gun battalions, two large sword battalions, one large signal corps, and two large propaganda corps. The army has over 50,000 soldiers, over 39,000 rifles, and over 1,000 carbines, but ammunition is scarce. Wang's forces have set up a small arsenal in a certain county in eastern Jilin, with over 40 workers manufacturing light machine guns, landmines, hand grenades, and spare parts, etc. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Commander Yu Daren of the Jilin Righteous Army, in conjunction with Wang Delin, Kong Xianrong, Li Haiqing, Qin Weihua, and other units, is surrounding Yongji and engaged in artillery battles with the Japanese army. There are only over 200 Japanese soldiers in Yongji city, but they are supported by aircraft that drop bombs from time to time. A portion of the army is besieging Changchun. After the Righteous Army under Geng Jizhou reoccupied Gaoqiao, they continued to advance towards Shenyang on the morning of the 6th to participate in the September 18th joint attack on Shenyang. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Delin's troops occupied Xiaobai Mountain and Longtan Mountain on the 5th and 6th. Wang Delin personally supervised the general attack on Houjiang, Mifeng, and Longtan Mountain, killing 130 Japanese soldiers, including the death of a certain Japanese army battalion commander. On the National Salvation Army side, one battalion commander was killed in action. They captured thirty or forty rifles. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At a time when Japan is about to recognize "Manchukuo," the Northeast Volunteer Army is becoming increasingly active and has the momentum to attack Changchun and Shenyang. The Jilin Volunteer Army under Wang Delin is reportedly heading towards Changchun, where the Japanese and Manchu armies have gathered and deployed defenses. Furthermore, Commander-in-Chief Mutō urgently transferred Japanese troops from Suizhong to defend Changchun. Another force of Volunteer Army under Wang Delin is currently attacking Jilin. It is also reported that the Volunteer Army, which is very active near Tongliao, has joined forces with the Mongolian Volunteer Army in that area, calling themselves the Northeast First and Second Volunteer Army Corps. They are currently moving from the Mongolian border towards Siping Street, vowing to directly attack Shenyang and recover the lost territories. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Two Teams of Zhang Haipeng's Troops Surrounded <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Two large teams of Zhang Haipeng's troops were surrounded by the National Salvation Army in the Battle of Laoye Ridge. The two teams were eager to defect, but the National Salvation Army, due to Zhang's repeated betrayals, refused to accept them. They are currently being surrounded and disarmed. Some of the troops of the Xi-Qia army have defected, and the defection is still continuing. The Japanese army is therefore dissatisfied with Xi-Qia. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Blue and White Flags Planted Outside Changji City <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Jilin talked about the fact that Wang Delin's troops launched an attack on Jilin and Changchun on the 24th and 25th of last month. The troops attacking Jilin were led by Commander Kong Xianrong with more than 10,000 infantry soldiers in two regiments advancing along the Ji-Dun Road. On the 3rd, they occupied Longtan Town and Xiaobai Mountain, more than ten li from the city. The troops attacking Changchun were led by Commander Wu Yicheng with two infantry brigades, two artillery battalions, and two machine gun companies, launching a pincer attack from Nanling and Erdaogou, approaching the city. The current resident Japanese troops are over 3,000 from the Duomen Division, and there are over 10,000 Japanese troops in Changchun, all building fortifications, erecting electric fences, and defending tightly, not daring to fight. Outside Changji city, blue and white flags and National Salvation Army flags have been planted everywhere, and morale is extremely high. Jilin and Changchun can be recovered within days. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ma Zhanshan's Troops Advance on Tai'an <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) Currently, there are 2,000 troops from Ma Zhanshan's remaining forces, including Liu Bin and Xu Jingde, in the Heihe area. As for Deng Wen's troops of over 1,000, they have advanced to the vicinity of Tai'an Town and are currently reorganizing their units to advance on Tai'an Town. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Li Haiqing's Troops Repel Japanese Army <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) After Yushu County in Jilin Province and Anda County in Jiang Province were successively recovered by the Righteous Army, they advanced along the road towards the puppet capital. It is reported that the troops there are Li Haiqing and others, leading approximately 4,000 men, and are the elite troops of the Volunteer Army. The Japanese army under Changshan was ordered to set out to meet them in battle, but was repelled by Li's troops. Therefore, the prestige of this unit is widespread, and there is a response from far and wide. They are currently contacting friendly forces to plan a major offensive. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Large Numbers of Japanese Reinforcements Arrive in Eastern Provinces <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Because the Volunteer Army launched a major offensive on September 18th, the Kwantung Army headquarters requested reinforcements from the Japanese Army Ministry, which was approved. In recent days, over 4,000 Japanese soldiers have been transferred from Yitong, Xifeng, and other places. Large numbers of tanks and troops have successively passed through Shenyang and set off towards the puppet Fengshan Road. A large number of reinforcements have also arrived in Shenyang from Andong. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Gaoshanzi Occupied by Righteous Army <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The more than 3,000 Righteous Army soldiers occupying Hujiawopu attacked Gaoshanzi and Dahushan again on the night of the 6th, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese garrison under Matsuda, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Righteous Army occupied Gaoshanzi and is currently attacking the railway station. The situation in Dahushan is extremely dangerous. The puppet Fengshan Railway trains have been heavily delayed in recent days. The Righteous Army has risen up in Badaogou, Heishan, Zhaojiatun, and other places, and the puppet Fengshan Railway is about to be cut off. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Commander Shan Guishan of the Third Route Army of the National Salvation Army will leave Shanhaiguan tonight and lead all of his soldiers eastward within days to contact the Righteous Armies of various routes and attack Dahushan. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Righteous Army Wu Chaogang telegraphed Beiping, stating that his troops occupied Qingduizi on the night of the 3rd. The enemy retreated to Goubangzi, suffering heavy losses. Wu's troops are currently pursuing the enemy. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Tian Xiuqiao, the commander of the Second Regiment of the Fifth Brigade under Ma Zhanshan, came to Nanjing to report to the central government on the recent situation of his unit. According to him, the unit is currently gathering in the northeastern part of Heilongjiang Province, replenishing ammunition, and preparing to attack. The rumors that the Russians are supplying weapons and ammunition and that General Ma was killed in action are purely fabrications by the Japanese and are completely untrue. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A person from Rehe talked about the fact that Rehe is mostly calm. About a battalion of Japanese soldiers are stationed in Chaoyang Temple east of Nanling. However, they are very busy installing military telephones in the rear. Rehe troops are stationed in Nanling. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Copy of Credentials Delivered to the Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan visited Arima Akizumi at the Japanese Consulate at 11:00 AM on the 8th, and the conversation lasted approximately ten minutes. Arima also hosted a banquet for Foreign Minister Luo, Vice Ministers Xu and Liu, and important personnel from the Foreign Ministry at the Japanese Consulate on the evening of the 8th, and then returned to Shanghai on the night train. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Arima Akizumi took the night train to Shanghai, accompanied by Yano, Horiuchi, Toyota, and others. The Foreign Ministry sent Section Chief Qu Chang of the Protocol Section to take care of them at the station. It is reported that Arima sent Uemura and Horiuchi to deliver a copy of the credentials to the Foreign Ministry on the morning of the 8th, which will be presented to Chairman Lin after he returns to Beijing.

<p>French and German Commissioners Pass Through Shenyang Northbound</p>
<p>(Beiping) The aide-mémoire submitted by our side to the League of Nations is approximately 20,000 words. The representative office in China has closed. Secretary-General Wang Guangqi will go to Beijing with Liu Dipan. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the Mission, before leaving Beiping, Lytton stated that the main points of the report's conclusions recognize that sovereignty over the Northeast still belongs to China, and that the puppet organization is described directly according to the facts, because the League of Nations' repeated resolutions in January of this year did not regard Japan's actions in the Northeast as legal. The past politics of the Northeast are strictly criticized from the standpoint of maintaining the spirit of the treaties. The contents transmitted by the telegram from Tokyo yesterday are absolutely untrue and are intentional propaganda. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The French and German commissioners of the League of Nations Investigation Team, as well as the Japanese assessor, Ambassador Isaburo Yoshida, and others, arrived safely in Shenyang at 3:30 PM yesterday. The commissioners departed at 6:50 AM this morning for Harbin. After spending one night in Harbin, they will depart from Harbin by plane on the morning of the 10th, pass through Qiqihar to Manzhouli, and then proceed to Geneva via the Siberian Railway. (8th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Ambassador Yoshida, an assessor of the Investigation Team, returned to his country on the Ural Maru, which set sail today. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wang Refuses to Accept Premier's Salary</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee resolved on the 8th to send Tang Youren to Shanghai, representing the central government, to urge Wang to return to Beijing as soon as possible to preside over the affairs of the Central Political Council and other matters. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo went to Shanghai a few days ago to visit Wang Jingwei for his illness and returned to Beijing on the morning of the 8th. According to him, Wang is temporarily staying in Shanghai for medical treatment due to his chronic illness, and it is expected that he will be able to return to Beijing within this week. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The salary and public expenses for August of the President of the Executive Yuan were sent to Wang Jingwei by the Yuan a few days ago. Wang returned them, refusing to accept them.

<h3 id="e18">Inner Mongolian Chief Administrator Telegraphs Request to Recover Gangyai <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Inner Mongolian Chief Administrator telegraphed the joint office in Beijing of various leagues and banners, saying that the number of Mongolian refugees from Darigangyai is increasing daily, and the government has provided relief. The Mongolian people have publicly elected Chemotbalerzhuur and three others to report that when Outer Mongolia became independent in the tenth year of the Republic of China, it sent people to incite them. At that time, Chief Administrator Buyantelger mistakenly went astray and immediately rebelled. Wing Commander Buyandelqi was unwilling to agree and led 48 Mongolian people under his command to escape. Subsequently, most of those who wanted to escape were investigated by troops sent by Outer Mongolia, who set up 13 checkpoints on the southern border of Gangyai to prevent them from escaping. All official camel and horse herds in Gangyai were confiscated. Of the livestock owned by the Mongolian people, only a total of 200 cattle and horses were left for each household, and the rest were confiscated as official property. In the eighteenth year, a group of young hooligans and former Mongolian officials in Outer Mongolia disputed and went to the Moscow government to request a resolution. Subsequently, the Russian government sent Russian party members to hold a meeting with both sides in Kulun, and decided that the leftists were legitimate, and the political situation changed again. A conscription law was also established, stipulating that all those between the ages of 18 and 45 were within the age of military service. The current soldiers are mainly strong young men between the ages of 22 and 23. After the Eastern Provinces were occupied by Japan last year, Russian party members gave speeches everywhere, emphasizing the importance of Japan and saying that other things were not worth worrying about. Subsequently, most of the troops were transferred to the border area between Beiman and Russia to be stationed. All 13 checkpoints originally set up in Gangyai have now been removed, except for one checkpoint that is still there and patrols in a roundabout way. This checkpoint is set up in the southern part of Gangyai, in a place called Alec Morituka, with no more than five or six soldiers. Therefore, there is an opportunity to escape, and approximately 300 men and women have escaped successively, requesting rescue. It has been found that there used to be a team of Outer Mongolian soldiers stationed in Gangyai, numbering 50 men. Now, about half of them have been transferred, leaving only 20 to 30 men. If we can take the opportunity to recover Gangyai, it would be a good opportunity. If it cannot be done, please find a way to help our families escape from the paddy fields and other places, in order to win their hearts. It would be best to recover our inherent territory in Chahar. Otherwise, we can also ask them to find a way to rescue their families. Sincerely, Chief Administrator Nima Otosojiang (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Shandong Provincial Party Department Cables Beijing to Request Special Pardon</p>
<p>(Beiping) Important figures in the North China military, such as Yan Xishan and Shang Zhen, have telegraphed to Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province, to intercede for the assassin of Zhang Zongchang. Feng Yuxiang also sent someone to Jinan to beg for Zheng Jicheng's pardon. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju said that the Zhang assassination case will have to be resolved legally in the future, but it must be based on the central government's telegram instruction or the filing of a lawsuit by his family before Zheng can be handed over to the court. However, the reply telegram from the central government only said "acknowledged." His family has not filed a lawsuit either, so Zheng has not yet been sent to court. This fact is unexpected. For example, if an important person from the central government comes, the local government is naturally responsible for protection. Zhang is a civilian who came to Jinan voluntarily, and there is no protection. Afterwards, Zhang Yiping sent a letter, and Wan Fulin sent a telegram, which were both consistent with the facts. At present, there are many families of those who were brutally killed by Zhang who have applied to follow Zheng, but the provincial government really has no right to handle it. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At today's routine meeting of the Provincial Party Department, it was decided to telegraph the central government to transfer to the National Government, ordering the Shandong Provincial Government to pardon Zheng Jicheng, with the general idea that Zhang Zongchang not only caused disaster to Shandong and the country, but was also the main culprit in the assassination of Chen Yingzhi. Zheng's killing of him is justifiable and cannot be convicted of ordinary murder. In addition, the families of those who were brutally killed by Zhang are now gathered in Jinan, carrying out a large-scale movement to support Zheng. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The county party departments of Xuzhou telegraphed Han Fuju on the 7th, pointing out that Zhang Zongchang led troops south at the age of 岁, poisoning the people and committing all kinds of sins. Zheng Jicheng's assassination of Zhang was not only to avenge his father, but also to eliminate a traitor for the country. Please handle it leniently. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Li Xiangen Releases Statement</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is heard that Gu Mengyu agreed to Li Xiangen's request and allocated £100,000 from the remaining Gengzi Indemnity funds to complete the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong Railway. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Xiangen, Director of the Guangdong-Shaoguan Railway Bureau, stated that the section from Shaoguan to Zhuting in Hunan of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway will be completed within four years, connecting with the Guangzhou-Shaoguan and Wuchang-Changsha sections, allowing the entire line to be open to traffic. The Ministry of Railways is currently dispatching troops to reorganize the Wuchang-Changsha and Guangzhou-Shaoguan sections. The surplus from these two lines will be used to extend the unfinished sections. It is understood that the section from Shaoguan to Zhuting in Hunan is over 270 kilometers, about 800 Chinese miles, passing through Libutou, Yangxi, Lechang, Qi , Jindongling, Pingshi, Yizhang, Xingci, Lingsuli, Liangwan, Shelian Field Waterside, Shaoli, Chenzhou, Xifengdu, Gongpingxu, Hengzhou, Hengshan, and reaching Zhuting. Most of the route passes through high mountains and steep ridges, making the project enormous. In particular, the section from Lechang Zuoling City to Chenzhou is even more difficult to tunnel through the mountains. The terrain between Chenzhou and Zhuzhou is flat and easier to proceed with. The total cost of the project is estimated to be around 50 million yuan. Purchasing locomotives, carriages, rails, and station buildings for the entire line will also require 50 million yuan. In the future, the entire railway will require 100 million yuan, which can be paid for with the remaining British Gengzi Indemnity funds. The Shaoguan-Lechang section, measuring 40 kilometers, has long been under the responsibility of the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau for construction. The section from Shaoguan to Libutou, about 12 kilometers long, has been under construction for several months and requires the construction of an iron bridge and the excavation of a spring cave. It will be completed in another two months. The entire Shaoguan-Lechang project is expected to be open to traffic by May next year. The cost of this section is also over 6 million yuan. In addition to the more than 2 million yuan already spent by the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau, the Ministry of Railways has recently allocated a batch of British Gengzi Indemnity funds to subsidize the project costs, but it still requires the signature of the board of directors. The Guangzhou-Shaoguan section was originally a commercial enterprise, which suffered severe losses due to military influence over the years. When Sun Zhesheng was the head of the department, it was nationalized, and 20 million yuan in public bonds were issued to recover the commercial shares. These public bonds have an annual interest rate of 4% and will be repaid in ten years. The procedures have been completed. Currently, the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway pays 40,000 yuan in interest per month. The monthly revenue of the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway is approximately 420,000 yuan, and 480,000 yuan in peak months.

<p>Will Force Puyi to Sign at All Costs</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 8th - Former senior staff officer of the Kwantung Army, Major General Itagaki, who is now an advisor to the pseudo-regime of Puyi, was recently ordered to come to Tokyo to negotiate with the Japanese government on the issue of recognizing the pseudo-state. The draft treaty prepared by the Japanese Foreign Ministry has been approved by the Japanese cabinet and submitted to the Privy Council for review. The Japanese government has ordered Itagaki to take this case back to Shenyang and discuss the implementation method with Commander Mutō. Itagaki flew back to Shenyang from Haneda Airport this morning and is scheduled to arrive in Shenyang on the 10th to discuss with Mutō the timing of the presentation of the Manchurian state. It is heard that the date has been set for the 18th and after to be sent to the pseudo-state and forced Puyi to sign it.</p>

<p>Japanese Press, Tokyo, 8th - The Japanese plenipotentiary to the League of Nations General Assembly, Yōsuke Matsuoka, met Lieutenant General Honjō in Nagoya last night. After exchanging important opinions on the Manchurian issue and the League of Nations issue, Honjō immediately left Nagoya in his original car. He arrived in Tokyo at 9:30 this morning. The Emperor's envoy, Kawagishi, representatives of various imperial families, Minister of the Army Araki, Deputy Chief of Staff Masaki, and Prime Minister Saitō and other cabinet members all came to the station to welcome him. After Honjō got out of the car, he went to the palace to meet the Emperor and report in detail the situation since the Manchurian Incident. The Emperor immediately gave Honjō a decree, saying that he had served as the commander of the Kwantung Army, was in a foreign land, responded quickly to changes, acted decisively in emergencies, controlled the many with the few, and promoted the prestige of the imperial army. I am now pleased to hear of your return and deeply admire your merits and the loyalty of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Japanese Press, Tokyo, 8th - After Honjō Shigeru arrived in Tokyo, he issued a long statement saying that the people's enthusiastic public opinion on the problem of Japan's lifeline and the development of the country's fortunes can enable our army to accomplish the task of suppressing bandits and enable the 30 million people of Manchuria to build a new country. Now that the country's steps are difficult, only the unanimous determination of the people can solve the Manchurian problem and revitalize the country.</p>

<p>Domei News Agency, Yokohama, 8th - Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Katsuji Debuchi, who was on the same ship as the swimming athletes, arrived in Yokohama on the Chichibu Maru at 9:30 this morning with his family. Friends from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Foreign Minister Uchida's proxy, welcomed him at the dock. He then took a car to Tokyo. Also on board were movie stars Van Mingke and his wife and Marcel, the new Shanghai branch director of the American United Communications Agency.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - After arriving in Tokyo, Ambassador Debuchi told a Domei News Agency reporter that if Japan recognizes Manchuria, the United States may not take immediate diplomatic measures. The League of Nations may take some action, but the United States has not joined the League of Nations and may not act in concert with the League of Nations. The United States' support for the alliance's attitude and its behind-the-scenes direction may not be done by the United States. As for the United States' public opinion on the Manchurian issue, it was once tense after the Manchurian Incident, but it has gradually calmed down since the withdrawal of troops from the Shanghai Incident. It seems to have understood Japan's position, while the Japanese people have an excessive sense of importance to the United States' attitude.</p>

<p>Saying That All Countries Have No Time to Attend to the Far East</p>
<p>The Chinese Government Must Suppress Anti-Japanese Activities</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 8th - Foreign Minister Uchida visited Saionji at the Gotemba this morning to report on the progress of the Diet, the issue of recognizing the Manchurian pseudo-state, countermeasures against the League of Nations, and the situation of various governments toward Japan. He is scheduled to return to Tokyo today.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 8th - Foreign Minister Uchida visited Saionji at Gotemba this morning and held talks for about one hour and twenty minutes. He returned to Tokyo at 6:00 p.m. He told reporters that Japan wants to recognize Manchuria as soon as possible for three reasons: (1) to reassure the 30 million people of Manchuria to build their country, and foreigners can therefore know Japan's determination; (2) to show that Japan has no ambition to annex it; (3) to prevent the intervention of the United States and the League of Nations. Many people think that if Japan recognizes the "Manchurian State," all countries in the world will interfere with Japan, and China will also promote the boycott of Japanese goods. However, according to information obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all sectors are currently suffering from economic panic and internal chaos. Although they are unwilling, they have no energy to get involved in the Far East issue. Even if a certain country comes forward to interfere, Japan has already decided on its policy, so even if it interferes, it will only be in vain. As for the issue of China's boycott of Japanese goods, due to the lessons of the Shanghai War, the National Government will do its best to suppress it. Therefore, the issue of boycotting Japanese goods is not worth worrying about. The above views seem to be arrogant and dismissive of everything. Japanese Press, Tokyo, 8th - Foreign Minister Uchida told reporters in the train to Okitsu today that the timing of the recognition of Manchuria is not much different from what the world expects. Before recognition, whether or not to notify the League of Nations and other countries is not necessary to say clearly now. In short, to avoid harming the feelings of other countries, whether Russia will also recognize Manchuria after Japan recognizes it is an extremely complicated diplomatic problem. In my opinion, recognition will definitely benefit Russia.</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Saitō Cabinet Will Not Last Long <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Expected to Step Down After Recognizing the Pseudo-State</p>
<p>Prince Hiranuma Is the Most Promising Successor</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 8th - Since the third extraordinary Diet, the Saitō Cabinet has deeply understood that it is difficult to be friends with the Seiyūkai, and the power of the Minseitō is weak. To maintain the regime, it must be reorganized. If it is reorganized, it will inevitably conflict with the Seiyūkai, dissolve the Diet, and hold new elections. However, the Minseitō, in the current situation, will hardly get more than half of the seats in this election. According to observations in Japanese political circles, around October this year, the Saitō Cabinet will choose to resign at an appropriate time after recognizing the pseudo-state. The Seiyūkai is aware that the Saitō Cabinet will not last long, and the Suzuki President's compromise with the military has not been achieved, so it is difficult to gain power. Therefore, the Mori Kaku and Kuhara factions are more closely aligned with the military and Prince Hiranuma in the hope that Prince Hiranuma will take power. The Adachi faction is also in agreement with this movement, while the Minseitō wants to welcome General Ugaki, the Korean Governor, to succeed Ruo as president, and dissolve the Diet after Saitō resigns as prime minister. However, General Ugaki is not very active. The general trend of Japanese politics has turned to Fascist rule. Therefore, the most promising successor to the prime minister is Prince Hiranuma, the representative of the military.</p>

<p>Interfered With by the Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - The Osaka and Kobe branches of the New York National City Bank, under the order of the New York headquarters, used cameras to photograph important buildings and locations that were completely unrelated to the financial industry, such as the Osaka Prefectural Government, the Osaka City Hall, the Mint, and the port construction machinery and bridges. From the perspective of national defense, the military authorities considered this to be serious and ordered the head of the military police to investigate. The commander of the military police, Qin, recently completed the investigation and reported to Minister of the Army Araki in the afternoon of the 7th. The bank said that it was for business reference. The military authorities were afraid that it would be used for military purposes and issued warnings to the bank and photography companies, ordering them to stop immediately. However, there were also instructions to photograph the same buildings and locations sent to the Tokyo, Yokohama, Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin branches. The authorities attach great importance to this.</p>

Upon their return, they will use the National Youth Federation as a base to promote immigration to Manchuria to its two million members. To intensify the mobilization of youth, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry today hosted a farewell banquet for these representatives, with the Minister of Agriculture himself presiding.

A certain key figure in the Tokyo Municipal Government also received bribes and sided with the company.

<p>Washington, 7th (Kokumin News Agency) - It has recently been learned from usually reliable sources that the United States intends to take no further action regarding the Manchurian situation until the League of Nations' investigation team releases its report. It is anticipated that the State Department will wait quietly for world opinion to have an opportunity to consider the report. However, if the contents of the new agreement concluded between Japan and Manchuria, or Secretary Stimson's detailed study of the Far Eastern situation, necessitate a change in the US's attitude, then the US will also change its attitude. Since returning to Washington from vacation, Secretary of State Stimson has personally studied the Far Eastern situation. Today, a State Department official told reporters that they do not recognize the current relationship between Japan and the so-called "Manchukuo" as formal diplomatic recognition, but believe that the commencement of such diplomatic recognition is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>US Authorities Deny Request to Postpone Convening</p>
<p>War Debt Issue to be Discussed Secretly</p>
<p>Paris, 7th (Kokumin News Agency) - Parisian newspapers today carried a report from Washington stating that the US government intends to postpone the World Economic and Financial Conference, scheduled to be convened this autumn, until January of the following year. This is because the US presidential election is imminent, and there is still no prospect of a clear domestic political situation. If the US does send a delegation to participate, the prospects are uncertain, so consultations have begun with various countries. After publishing this report, Parisian newspapers commented that the US's attitude lacked sincerity and claimed that the US also wanted to find a way to move the conference venue from Europe to Washington.</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (Reuters) - US administrative authorities recently stated that the US government's policy remains to fully promote the convening of the World Economic Conference. Recently, there were sudden rumors that the US government, in view of the upcoming presidential election, would postpone the World Economic Conference. The authorities expressed surprise at this and this rumor also attracted the attention of European countries, so the US government authorities are eager to clarify their position. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources in Washington, although the war debt issue will not be allowed to be discussed openly at the upcoming conference, it will in fact be carefully discussed. However, it is possible that this discussion will not be public.</p>

<p>Many Twists and Turns in Negotiations with Germany</p>
<p>Poland Waves Flags and Shouts Support for France</p>
<p>Paris, 7th (Reuters) - Regarding Germany's demand for equality in armaments, public opinion in France seems to be divided. Before France makes a decision on this matter, many twists and turns in diplomatic relations seem inevitable. This is becoming increasingly clear. The French cabinet met today to discuss this issue for three hours, but what it decided remains confidential. Only a very vague report was released after the meeting, stating that Herriot had reported on foreign affairs. However, it is heard that a draft reply is being prepared, which, in addition to discussing the legal and political points raised in the German memorandum, will state that the Treaty of Versailles can only be modified with the consent of all signatory countries. German Foreign Minister Neurath publicly announced the original text of the memorandum yesterday, demanding that other countries uniformly reduce their armaments to the level of German armaments stipulated in the treaty. The publication of this document has not been opposed by French political circles, as openness in everything, as Germany is now doing, is the most prudent policy. However, the discussions in the French newspapers are not so satisfactory. The opinions of Parisian and other French newspapers can be represented by the arguments of Débats and Le Figaro. Débats stated that German policy can only lead to war. Le Figaro's words were even more impassioned, stating that Germany meant that even though the war was a failure, in Germany's eyes, it should have been a victory. Warsaw, 7th (Kokumin News Agency) - The Polish Foreign Ministry today issued an article, clearly directed at France, stating that France and Poland have close relations with Germany. The Polish government absolutely opposes Germany's demand for equality in armaments. According to Article 1 of the 1921 Franco-Polish agreement, France should act in concert with Poland on all issues affecting the treaty between the two countries.</p>

<p>Paris, 7th (Kokumin News Agency) - It is widely rumored here that the visit to Europe by US Chief of Staff General MacArthur is because the US definitely intends to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. It is further reported that the Soviet Union's semi-official representative in Washington, Mr. Swirsky, has made concrete proposals to the Washington government as an initial step towards formal US recognition of the Soviet Union. This report is supported by various other pieces of evidence, such as the listing of Soviet securities on US stock exchanges and the cashing of Soviet promissory notes at US banks. The rapprochement between the US and the Soviet Union is indeed of great significance. It is also heard that the Soviet Union has allowed the US to establish a naval base in the Kamchatka Peninsula. The southernmost tip of that peninsula is adjacent to Japan's Kuril Islands, with a distance of only seven miles between them. Furthermore, the Soviet Union will acknowledge the freedom loans lent to Russia by the US in 1917, as well as other loans from the imperial era, amounting to approximately $87.5 million.</p>

<p>Abridged Translation: Japan's War Against the World</p>
<p>丨Contradictory Ideas of the External Affairs Ministry and the Military丨</p>
<p>丨Caught in the Predicament of Being at Odds with the World丨</p>
<p>When the Manchurian Incident suddenly broke out, officials from the External Affairs Ministry and the military gathered and said, "It's a pity it was two or three years too early." From this, we can infer that they meant the action was taken too early, and preparations were not yet complete. This is what I regret.</p>
<p>However, this is not referring to the military. The military had already completed preparations three or four years ago. When Zhang Zuolin fled outside the customs, the military was eager to try. Therefore, they only regretted the delay in the arrival of a major opportunity, and there was no reason to dislike that it came too early. Moreover, there was the pressure of disarmament conferences abroad and public opinion at home advocating for a reduction in the army. The exhaustion of the great powers presented a great opportunity. The American navy was not to be feared at all. Innumerable reasons could stir up their ambition. So what is meant by "preparations not yet complete"? It refers to diplomacy, the government's inability to control the external affairs ministry and public opinion. In other words, the external affairs ministry had no clever plan to solve the Manchuria-Mongolia problem, the external affairs ministry and the military had different ideas, and the government had no unified wisdom and courage, which led Japan into a dilemma, trapped in the predicament of being at odds with the world and unable to extricate itself.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the ideas of the external affairs ministry. The external affairs ministry believes that the era of valuing force is over. In the future, it is more beneficial to rely on the power of law and international public opinion to seek international cooperation than to respect force. Therefore, unless China openly challenges with force, it is absolutely impossible to retreat to the path of valuing force. This is the idea of ​​Shidehara diplomacy. To know why Shidehara diplomacy has this idea, we must consider the lessons of the European War. Before the European War, the great powers generally took the path of valuing force, rising with force and dominating the world with force. It was not only Germany, but also England, which once used its powerful navy to boast to the world. However, these ideas were shattered into powder by the European War.</p>
<p>First, the nature of war has completely changed. In the past, wars were fought only between soldiers. Today's wars are struggles of the entire nation, and material, moral, and economic aspects are all destroyed. Second, the victorious countries also feel the same pain as the defeated countries, and both are exhausted. It is not only impossible to promote national prestige and increase the welfare of the people by relying on victory, but there is also a tendency to perish with it.</p>
<p>This kind of fact, due to the huge sacrifice of the European War, Germany first realized it, and the European countries gradually realized it, and finally the whole world also realized it. As a result, everyone realized that the reliance on militarism is not reliable. Therefore, international coordinationism and the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity arose vigorously. Those who want to sail with the wind and take advantage of the world trend to reach the other shore are exactly where the ideas of the Shidehara diplomatic faction lie.</p>
<p>In short, Shidehara diplomacy is international coordinationism, international leagueism, and non-militarism. It adopts a pro-friendship policy and co-existence and co-prosperity policy towards China. This is its general outline. However, it is by no means allowing people to trample on it without resistance. The reason why it does not approve of the use of troops is that the Manchuria-Mongolia problem is not only a problem between China and Japan, but a major problem related to the whole world. Unless the surrounding circumstances are all in our favor, we must not act rashly. England and the United States especially showed goodwill to us two or three years before the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident. The key lies in this. What a pity is that we have neither been able to make the great powers understand our special situation in Manchuria and Mongolia, nor have we had a clever plan to overcome difficulties so that China and Japan can live in peace, which has led to an uncontrollable situation. This is what the Shidehara diplomatic faction should be responsible for.</p>
<p>Opposite to Shidehara-style international coordinationism is the military's reliance on force. They believe that justice, humanity, peace, and non-war are nothing more than hypocrites' masks to deceive people. In the end, only the two words "force" are genuine and not false. According to them, the most important thing in international relations is the conflict of national interests. Once there is a conflict, it is easy to tend to attack each other. At this time, without military preparations, it is impossible to suppress it at any time and prevent it from breaking down. The implication is that maintaining peace has nothing to do with justice and humanity. Only military strength can ensure it. They directly recognize military preparations as a guarantee of peace.</p>
<p>What kind of ideas do they have about the Manchuria-Mongolia problem? There is a kind of patriot in our country who likes to sing loudly about the theory of seizing Manchuria and Mongolia. Now, as they say, Manchuria and Mongolia are not Chinese mainland. But to openly say that we want to seize it out of thin air, don't we violate the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact? This is also impossible to argue strongly. On this point, our military seems to have admitted it. Therefore, the military has never dared to advocate the violent theory of seizing Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>I remember that Minister of the Army Aramaki once expressed his opinion in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, roughly saying that maintaining peace in the Far East is Japan's duty. Anyone who disturbs peace in the Far East, whether it is China or another country, must be conquered. If the Japanese lack this kind of belief and spirit, they will be insulted by China or another country, and they will be ashamed in front of the whole country and the world. This kind of statement cannot be equated with the German-style militarism, but it is a kind of manifestation of reliance on force.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Japan Speeds Up Construction of Aircraft Factories <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>And Speeds Up the Production of Various Military Supplies</p>
<p>Intending to Provoke a Major War in the Far East</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence - Since the outbreak of the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the war-crazed Japanese military has become increasingly nervous about preparations for a major war in the Far East. Recently, various arsenals have been working day and night to speed up work, increase workers, and add machines. In particular, the accelerated construction of aircraft factories clearly indicates its attempt at a final struggle.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, Mitsubishi Aircraft Manufacturing Co., Ltd. has newly purchased 13 million yen of manufacturing machines, Nakajima Aircraft Co., Ltd. has newly purchased 8 million yen of manufacturing machines, and Ishikawajima Aircraft Co., Ltd. has newly purchased 4 million yen of manufacturing machines. The situation of increasing equipment three times in a row will soon be expanded again. Therefore, the current busyness of various arsenals has reached an unprecedented peak. Now, Mitsubishi Aircraft Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is buying 500,000 yen worth of working machines from domestic iron factories in its Nagoya and Tokyo factories. On August 20th, it also ordered 20 sets of 12 kinds of working machines from various machinery factories, which must be delivered by early November. It can be seen that Japan's preparations for war are extremely urgent.</p>
<p>In early February, Nakajima Aircraft Co., Ltd. ordered a large number of machines for manufacturing aircraft from "Ping Du Liu Si · Ha Wa Te Commercial Co.," Okuma Iron Works, and Hirao Iron Works. The Ishikawajima Aircraft Co., Ltd. also purchased a large number of lathes for its new factory constructed this spring. The fighter planes manufactured by the aircraft department of Kawasaki Shipyard have been designated for purchase by the army, and its forging factory has also switched to heavy oil, newly added electrical work, and ordered a large number of lathe ironware, etc.</p>
<p>The Aichi Electric Clock and Watch Factory in Nagoya and the Hamamatsu Musical Instrument Factory have added factories and are manufacturing propellers needed by aircraft day and night. The internal combustion engine department of the Osaka Machinery Works has also added factories. Tokyo Nishino Manufacturing Co., Ltd. plans to expand its project in five years, manufacturing aircraft-needed accessories, and hiring graduates from higher industrial schools to participate in the work with heavy money. Ishikawajima Automobile Factory and Tokyo Gas Electric Factory are very busy manufacturing aircraft accessories day and night. Moreover, Ishikawajima has also received many orders for military vehicles from the army, and has delivered a large number of military vehicles several times. After inspection by the Ministry of the Army, the long-distance exercises from Tokyo to Shimonoseki have achieved good results. Japan Automobile Factory has submitted a budget proposal for military six-wheeled vehicles to the Ministry of the Army. After approval by the army, it has started to speed up the construction. At the same time, it is heard that a special expenditure of 250,000 yen will be used to expand its scale, and the Omori factory has also ordered "motorcycle," "engine," and "automobile" manufacturing machines. The Toyo Industry Company of the 工菱 system invested 200,000 yen for the first time this year to expand its scale, and then invested 150,000 yen to enrich its internal organization. Other iron factories that are relatively modern have directly or indirectly received secret orders from the Japanese Army and Navy Ministry to secretly manufacture the latest killing weapons, so that they can be supplied to the military in large quantities once a war breaks out. The ambitions of the Japanese warlords can be fully expressed here. (Hua Lian News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Guangdong Executive Committee Cables to Urge Resistance to Japan and National Salvation <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>And Plans to Propose Punishment of Rebels at the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The Central Committee members of the Kuomintang in Guangdong will attend the Third Plenary Session to be held in Nanjing, and a small number of them will attend, but those who hold military and political positions in Guangdong will not attend. Regarding the proposals of the Guangdong side for the Third Plenary Session, the principles of the proposals have been discussed by the various Central Committee members in recent days, roughly: (1) Please the National Government to issue a clear order to punish the rebels, recover the lost territory in the Northeast and aid Rehe; (2) Please the National Government to severely punish those who do not resist, mislead the country, and lose territory, in order to comply with the long-term resistance; (3) Consolidate the national defense of the Southwest and develop the industry and transportation of the Southwest; (4) Oppose the secret sale of ancient relics from the Forbidden City, and request the central government to impose sanctions. It is heard that there are more than ten proposals, which will be submitted to the Central Committee members attending the session in Nanjing for presentation at the conference after they have been drafted. As for the case of urging the central government to recover the lost territory in the Northeast, a telegram has been issued in the name of the Southwest Executive Committee, the original text of which reads: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee of the National Government, the Japanese bandits have seized the Northeast and are now attacking Rehe. At this time when Rehe is in a tight situation, the matter of threatening Shanghai has also been heard. The Japanese side's intention is nothing more than to shift the people's sight line to Shanghai to facilitate a clever seizure. National disaster is so urgent, it seems that we should make plans early to save the situation. Now, I will only state what I have seen. The Japanese people's plot to attack us has long been a consistent policy. Seizing the Northeast is only the first step of their plan. They will use the Northeast as a base, and then from Rehe to Eastern Mongolia, Tianjin, and then to Jiaoji, Ninghan, and the whole country. People are plotting against me, so actively, and our central government has repeatedly issued declarations of resistance, but in fact it is cowardly and avoids things to seek temporary peace. I don't know that there is no place to hide in a dead end, and there is no way to avoid it. How can the peace at the bottom of the cauldron last? The loss of the Northeast in the beginning was also caused by this base psychology. The organization, training, equipment, and supply of the Northeast Army are all better than today's Volunteers. The Volunteers have been fighting against Japan for years and can still fight a protracted war. If the Northeast military authorities had the determination to defend the territory as the Volunteers do today, even if they could not win, they could still form a stalemate. How could several provinces lose their territory in one fell swoop, and the disaster spread to Shanghai? Again, when the 19th Route Army was in Shanghai, if its generals had done what the Northeast military authorities did, then Shanghai would have been the continuation of the three provinces, and the Japanese flag would still be flying high between Zhabei and Wusong. There is no doubt about this. However, even though the resistance failed, it was still possible to recover the lost territory. Is the result of resistance and non-resistance not clearly more obvious? The lessons of this kind of past fact are enough to show us the way to save the country. The Japanese people take the annexation of China as the ultimate goal, so the China problem is the national problem. The enemy and I have no reason to coexist. If the Northeast cannot be recovered, how can Rehe, Tianjin, and the Northeast be defended for a long time? Even Jiaoji and Ninghan cannot be safe. This is the most obvious thing in the world. Therefore, in today's situation, there is no other way to save the country except resistance. I urge our central government to carefully consider the opportunity of survival and destruction, and quickly make a major plan for Japan, from the declaration of resistance to the implementation of resistance, and urge capable troops to go to the Northeast and recover the lost territory. Otherwise, even if other troops want to resist the insult, there is no way to communicate. This is tantamount to not resisting and not allowing others to resist, and directly becoming a hero of the Japanese bandits and a culprit of China. My heart is in danger, and I dare not be silent. I beg you to observe." The Southwest Executive Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang kowtows. (September 2nd, East India)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Ministry of Finance Newly Establishes Provisional Regulations on Export Tariffs <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News - The Ministry of Finance promulgated the following provisional regulations on export tariffs by ministerial order: (Article 1) For goods subject to ad valorem export and transit duties, the average wholesale market price at the time of customs inspection in the local area shall be used as the dutiable value. This average wholesale market price shall include the cost of packaging and sorting the goods, but taxes shall not be included. If there is no average wholesale market price available for examination at the port of export, the average wholesale market price of other major domestic markets may be used as the basis for calculating the dutiable value. (Article 2) For goods exported to foreign countries that have already been sold under contract, the genuine contract listing the selling price of the goods shall be presented together with the customs declaration. The contract may be regarded as proof of the price of the goods, but it is not necessarily regarded as conclusive proof. The interpretation of this point shall be at the discretion of the customs. In addition to requiring merchants to present contracts, the customs may also use all effective methods at will, such as checking other documents related to assessment and valuation, investigating detailed sales documents, examining merchants' books, inspecting goods, and, when necessary, engaging in all interviews and inviting any private individuals to assist in determining the dutiable value. (Article 3) If the exporter is dissatisfied with the price, classification, tax amount, or fees set by the customs, he may submit a written protest to the Customs Commissioner within 20 days after the customs declaration or other customs registration is filed, clearly stating the reasons for the objection. Before the case is resolved, the merchant may submit a deposit and request that the goods be released first. The amount of the deposit shall be sufficient to pay the fixed amount of tax and other additional taxes set by the customs, but this method is limited to those approved by the customs. Within 15 days after receiving the protest, the Customs Commissioner shall re-examine the case. If it is believed that the merchant's protest is unreasonable, the case shall be submitted to the Inspector General of Customs for review. If the Inspector General of Customs finds that the Customs Commissioner has handled the case appropriately, it shall be forwarded to the Customs Administration for review and determination by the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee. (Article 4) When the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee meets, all issues concerning procedures, etc., shall be decided by a majority vote. The majority vote shall be submitted to the Customs Administration for approval and promulgated within 15 days (excluding holidays) for unified compliance. (Article 5) If the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee determines that the actual price of the goods in dispute over the price exceeds the number originally declared by the protester by 20% or more, the customs may, in addition to collecting the normal tax payable, order the protester to pay a fine of 10 times or less the amount of tax concealed. (Article 6) If goods that have been sold under contract and are subject to price disputes have not been presented with the contract when declaring customs, the contract will not be recognized as proof of the price of the goods if it is presented to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Committee in the future. The protest will be deemed invalid.</p>

<p>Zhu Penglin's Factions Routed at Guangchang</p>
<p>Peng Dehuai's Elite Troops Eliminated</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Zhu Penglin (Biao) and Ji (Zhentong)'s four factions recently invaded from southern Jiangxi. Except for the Pseudo Fourth Army Corps guarding their base, the Pseudo First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps were concentrated in Yihuang. Luo Binghui's Pseudo Twelfth Army seized Nanfeng from Guangchang and plundered Nancheng, aiming to jointly attack Fuzhou. Fortunately, Chen Cheng and Wu Qiwai's armies, passing through Chongren and Lean from western Jiangxi, emerged southwest of Yihuang and recovered Yihuang. Seeing their route to Ningdu from Lean cut off, the bandits retreated south in two directions: one retreating via Huangpi near southeastern Yicheng towards Qia Village in Nanfeng, and the other detouring west of Nancheng to enter Nanfeng. From the 2nd, Chen Cheng, the front-line commander, led his divisions to advance towards the bandits in Nanfeng and Guangchang from Nancheng and Yihuang, while strong forces remained in the rear of Yihuang to search for remaining bandits and maintain order. Military sources report that Li Yunjie's division on the left wing first stormed into Nanfeng city on the 3rd, killing over a thousand bandits. Luo Binghui's Pseudo Twelfth Army, defending the city, retreated towards Ganzhu and Kuzhu in Guangchang. Li's division's staff office sent a telegram to the province yesterday, reporting the recovery of Nanfeng, which reads: "Our division arrived at Lita on the evening of the winter (2nd). At dawn of the next day, we, along with Xu's division, launched a general attack on Nanfeng County according to the original plan. The defenders of Nanfeng were Luo Binghui's troops, numbering 40,000, who relied on fortifications and resisted stubbornly. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers were brave and fierce, and with a determination to die, charged repeatedly without losing heart. The bandits were greatly demoralized and feared that Xu's division would outflank them, so they fled towards Guangchang in disarray. Before leaving, they looted and burned the city, causing over a million yuan in losses to the people, a truly unspeakable suffering. In this battle, over a thousand bandits were killed, and a large amount of military supplies were captured. Special notice is given." The Political Training Department of the 24th Division also telegraphed a report on the recovery of Nanfeng, stating: "Mao Bingwen, Li Yunjie, Xu Kexiang's divisions besieged Nanfeng at dawn on the next day. The bandits resisted relying on fortifications. After fierce fighting for several hours, they occupied Nanfeng city at 3 PM. Many bandits were killed, and countless military supplies were seized. The bandits are retreating towards Guangchang, and our army is in pursuit." The Political Training Department of the 5th Division also telegraphed a report, stating: "The Pseudo Third Army Corps' 2nd and 3rd divisions were besieged by our 14th Division in the northwestern mountains of Yihuang on the winter and next days. On the next day, the bandits attempted to flee west, but Wu Qiwai's army was searching from west to east, resulting in a pincer attack. Over 500 bandits were captured, along with over 400 rifles and 5 light and heavy machine guns. The 5th Division arrived at Tangyin and discovered that Peng's troops were still hiding in Dongkeng Mountain, 15 li from Tangyin. The bandits near Tangyin fled southwest on the next day upon hearing the news. In the morning, the 5th Division searched and eliminated the remaining bandits in the vicinity, capturing over ten bandits and seizing 4 rifles. Our armies are continuing the search and pursuit." From this, it is evident that the remaining bandit troops will not be able to hold out for long.</p>
<p>Another report: The Jiangxi bandits' attempts to flee to Fujian and Guangdong were unsuccessful, and they retreated to the southern Jiangxi area, where their situation is extremely dire. At this time, the Commander-in-Chief of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian Border Area剿匪總司令ordered all units to strictly blockade the bandit areas, causing the bandits to perish without being attacked. Knowing that it would be difficult to survive, the bandits recently gathered the remaining forces and launched a full-scale invasion of Lean, Yihuang, Nanfeng, and other places, hoping to join forces with Fang Shao's bandit troops in eastern Jiangxi and disrupt Fujian and Zhejiang. Fortunately, the National Army met them head-on with a severe blow. Recently, the elite 1st and 2nd divisions of Peng Dehuai's Pseudo Third Army Corps were completely eliminated in the Yihuang area by the National Army's 28th and 4th Armies, which intercepted them separately. Lean, Yihuang, and Nanfeng were successively recovered. The bandits suffered extremely heavy losses and are now fleeing back to their lairs in disarray.</p>

<p>Communist Bandits Launch a Major Riot in Xiao and Ling Counties</p>
<p>Local Militia and Police Join Forces to Pursue and Attack</p>
<p>Bandit Leaders Wang Xiaobai and Others Captured</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: In the northern Anhui counties of Su and Ling, popular uprisings occurred last month due to the collection of opium seedling taxes. When the Su County uprising first started, Communist leader Wang Xiaobai participated. At that time, farmers were being oppressed by corrupt gentry and local bullies. Wang Xiaobai called for the liberation of the farmers, which gained him the support of many rural villagers. He was elected as the commander-in-chief. Afterwards, the Su uprising was quickly resolved. The opium tax was exempted, saving farmers a total of over 2.3 million yuan in opium taxes, and the local area also gained considerable benefits. Seeing that the farmers were living peacefully and could not be exploited, Wang Xiaobai purely engaged in Communist activities. On the one hand, he took advantage of the conflict between the old and new factions in Su County. When the Su authorities were surrounded by the old faction and planned to arrest the leaders of the rioters, Wang instigated farmers to riot. On the other hand, he gathered party members and formed bandits to cause disturbances, operating between Su, Ling, Xiao, and Tong counties. At that time, all four counties sent police squads to prevent and block them. As for the farmers who were incited by Wang, they elected Wang as the commander-in-chief, and Communists Zi Yimin, Xu Huaizhen, and others were appointed to important positions. They gathered about 200 direct descendants of the Communist Party and united with Wu Xueming, the leader of the Wuji Dao, leading 400-500 members of the Red Spear Society to concentrate in northern Ling County. On the 1st of this month, they attacked Shicun. Shicun was a large town, and after a fierce battle all day, it was not captured. Shicun is an important area where Xiao and Ling counties meet, and it is close to Xiao County. Upon receiving the report, Xiao County Magistrate Wang Gongyu personally led a police squad to Chulan Town on the 2nd and proceeded to Zhangshan Town along with the 10th District Defense Corps of Xiao County to block and suppress the bandits. The bandits then abandoned the attack on Shicun on the 3rd and traveled overnight to Langanshan stronghold, intending to detour through Shixiang and deploy forces in the Phoenix Mountain area to cut off the Xiao County police squad's return route. Later, County Magistrate Wang learned of this plan and immediately led his team back to Chulan on the 4th. When bandit Wang realized that his plan had been exposed, he led his cadres around to Meishan near Chulan, while Wu Xueming led the Red Spear Society to Yutaishi and Linkou to hide. Just in time, the Tongshan County police squad arrived and blocked them at Taoshan and Yangzhuang. At the same time, the 9th Division also sent a team to Yusi to suppress them. County Magistrate Wang then led the entire police and defense corps to attack bandit Wang's cadres at Meishan. However, that area belonged to Ling County, and the villagers, incited by bandit Wang, expressed dissatisfaction with the Xiao police suppressing bandits across the border. County Magistrate Wang then stopped advancing further. Bandit Wang also fled to Daqingtong Mountain on the border of Xiao and Ling counties on the evening of the 4th, gathering his followers in Xiangqiao, Mafu, and other villages. County Magistrate Wang again led his team to track and pursue them. From dawn on the 5th to the afternoon, the bandits' strength was unsustainable, and they completely collapsed. The police squad then captured three Red bandit leaders, Wang Xiaobai, Xu Huaizhen, and Dou Yimin, and captured about 50 bandits, seizing more than 40 rifles and pistols and killing dozens of bandits. The gang was then sent to Chulan Town. The minor offenders were dealt with on the spot. Wang, Xu, and Dou were escorted to Xuzhou by County Magistrate Wang on the evening of the 6th and sent to the garrison headquarters for interrogation. County Magistrate Wang returned to Chulan on the 7th to handle the aftermath. Currently, the Communist bandits in southern Jiangsu and northern Anhui have been resolved. It is reported that Wang Xiaobai is a native of Su County, about 30 years old, and once studied at Peixin Middle School, which was run by the Xuzhou Christian Church. (7th)</p>

<p>Brief Situation of Luochuan</p>
<p>Luochuan covers an area of about 170 li east to west and about 200 li north to south, with a population of about 40,000. The county has more than 7,000 mu of cultivated land and more than 2,000 mu of barren land. The annual tax revenue is about 23,000 yuan from land tax, 18,000 yuan from surcharges, and 3,500 yuan from miscellaneous taxes. On the expenditure side, education expenses are about 7,300 yuan, the Public Security Bureau 4,800 yuan, the Finance Bureau 1,030 yuan, the Construction Bureau 1,030 yuan, the judiciary 1,800 yuan, and miscellaneous items 2,800 yuan. There are two senior primary schools, with about 220 students, one senior girls' primary school with about 37 students, and 95 junior primary schools with a total of about 1,400 students. In addition, there is also a public primary school. Tuition is not charged for any of these schools, but the senior primary schools receive about 2,000 yuan in public subsidies each year, the senior girls' primary school 1,000 yuan, and the public primary school 100 yuan. The expenses of the junior primary schools are fully borne by the local communities separately. Teachers' salaries are about 10 to 22 yuan per month for senior teachers and about 5 to 8 yuan for junior teachers. Cotton is grown on about 300 to 400 mu of land, with each mu yielding 30 jin. The cotton seeds are all domestic because American cotton seeds are not suitable for the local soil. The quality of the cotton is very good, and the fibers are also long. The county uses more than 80,000 jin of cotton each year, and the amount of cotton produced is not enough for local use. A veritable black cloth belt.</p>
<p>Shaanxi has three coal-producing areas: Guanzhong, Hanzhong, and Yulin. According to investigations by the Shaanxi Construction Department, the reserves are estimated at over 3,153 trillion tons in the Guanzhong area, 490 trillion tons in the Hanzhong area, and 1,116 trillion tons in the Yulin area, totaling 4,729 trillion tons. The northern figures are reduced and compromised numbers, and many omissions remain. The types range from peat, lignite, bituminous coal, semi-coal, coal gas, candle coal, and anthracite to graphite. Nothing is missing. The candle coal of Mian County is particularly unique. It resembles the Dakiji coal of Shanxi and the super white coal of England in appearance, and it burns very quickly with a long, strong flame, making it ideal for steamships and warships. In addition, the mines are very shallow, the engineering is simple, and projects can be started with funds of any size and produce results immediately.</p>

<p>Provincial Party Headquarters Sends Personnel to Inspect Social Education Institutions</p>
<p>Zhang Mingshun, dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters, arrived in Songjiang today, tasked with investigating whether social education institutions are making efforts to promote Party doctrines and how their work is progressing.

<p>Party and Government Officials Inspect the Seawall: The seawall in the Jinshanwei area of this county is currently being planned for repair by Xu Baikui, director of the Jiangnan Seawall Works. However, since the beginning of autumn, sudden hurricanes and floods have caused slight damage to the seawall, which has not yet been completed. Fellow townsmen in Beijing, including Lu Shunong, jointly telegraphed the County Party Headquarters, stating that the seawall is of great importance to the lives and property of people in several counties and that they had heard news of damage, requesting a thorough on-site inspection to reinforce the seawall. This matter was submitted to the Party and Government Talks Committee, which decided to schedule an inspection by Party and government agencies to clarify the truth. The agency hired a gasoline boat today to carry the heads of various bureaus of the county government and members of the Party Headquarters, accompanied by Director Xu Baikui, to inspect. They returned to Songjiang that day. Details of the inspection will be provided in a report later.</p>

<p>Efforts Begin to Clear Old Land Tax Arrears: The old land tax arrears in this county are quite substantial. Although the Land Tax Arrears Committee has cleared them several times, it has been unsuccessful due to poor management. Currently, local communities believe that if this continues, it will not only affect national tax revenue but also cultivate bad habits among those responsible for tax collection. Therefore, they have specifically submitted this matter to the current local administrative meeting, re-electing Chen Xiaochu, Lin Bocui, Shao Keren, and four others to form a clearance committee and reorganize it. It was formally established yesterday. In addition to the mutual election of Ruan Xiyao as executive secretary, responsible for organizing the work, accountant Fan XiongGuang has also been hired as the chief auditor. The clearance methods stipulate: (1) The chairman of the committee shall be the Director of the Finance Bureau, and, when necessary, representatives from various agencies may attend and participate. (2) The clearance sequence shall be divided into two phases, with the period from 1927 to 1931 as the first phase and the period before 1926 as the second phase. (3) All files and account books related to the land tax shall be sent by the Finance Bureau at any time, and a list of the serial numbers and collection tickets for each year shall be reported for review. (4) The amount of old arrears cleared by the committee each year shall be announced in the newspaper. If it is confirmed that a clerk or official has embezzled funds, the committee shall request the county government to order a limited-time recovery. (5) The clearance period shall be limited to two months, and the expenses shall be temporarily disbursed from the current year's contingency fund by the estate management office in the amount of 500 yuan, which shall be deducted and returned from the old arrears found in the future.</p>

<p>Various Sectors Rescue Zhu Tieying: The Mo Xie newspaper reported on business tax matters, angering the authorities and resulting in a prison sentence and fine. These matters have been recorded in this newspaper several times. Zhu Tieying has been imprisoned for more than ten days, but the county government has not yet sent out the judgment, preventing the defendant from appealing. Various sectors are indignant, believing that this action is deliberately difficult and uses public office for private gain. They have jointly submitted a complaint to the province with various organizations. Fellow townsmen in Shanghai, including Lu Jingshi, have also expressed their concerns. The business community in Fuqiao Town and other places in this county are also outraged, saying that County Magistrate Zhao disregards the people's hardships, shows no concern for business difficulties, and abuses his authority to stifle public opinion, which is outrageous. Businesses and others are willing to resist and vow to provide support. In addition to sending telegrams of condolence, they have also sent representatives to find ways to rescue him.</p>

<p>Limited Time to Complete the Re-verification of Household Registration for the Countryside Clearance: The county government held a temporary district chief meeting at 2 p.m. on the 6th. Chairman Chen, the county magistrate, discussed the following matters: (1) The chairman proposed that he recently received a letter from the Joint Defense Office of Wu, Kun, Qing, Jiang, Song, Jin, Xi, Wu, and Yi counties, informing him that the Civil Affairs Department had ordered a re-verification in accordance with the Countryside Clearance Regulations. How should this be effectively implemented? The decision was made to have the district offices, together with the local Public Security Bureaus, thoroughly re-verify household registrations and inspect firearms in accordance with the Countryside Clearance Regulations, and to report the results by September 20 for verification and forwarding. (2) The Rice Seed Selection Guidance Group organized by the Provincial Education Institute is going to various districts to provide guidance. The selection of seeds is related to agricultural improvement. How should this be assisted to facilitate progress? The decision was made that the district chiefs should first convene the heads and deputy heads of various villages and towns to explain that the selection of seeds is closely related to agricultural improvement. Once the group's instructors arrive in the villages, they should be jointly publicized and effectively assisted. At the same time, the county government should issue a notice so that everyone is aware.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Establishes a Property Transfer and Tax Collection Office: In this province, the transfer of property rights and the transfer of tax obligations among the people in various counties are handled by the Zhuangshu, Ceshushu, and Zhoushu offices in each county. However, there are many drawbacks. At the Provincial Government's 519th meeting, Finance Department Director Shu proposed that each county establish a property transfer and tax collection office. This was subsequently approved by the 520th meeting, and the regulations were promulgated, requiring each county to establish the office by September 1. It is now learned that the Zhenjiang County Finance Bureau, upon receiving the order, immediately sent personnel to prepare for the establishment of the office. The office was established on September 1, and all land tax registers have been transferred back to the Finance Bureau for management. Fearing that the villagers in various villages and towns are not yet aware, the regulations and the Zhenjiang County Government's joint announcement of the establishment of the property transfer and tax collection office will be posted. In the future, all private transfers of property rights in this county must use official contracts and personally go to the Finance Bureau to pay the transfer tax, transfer the tax obligation, and issue official seal certificates as proof of business. If anyone still collects taxes privately through bookkeepers, it will be invalid once discovered.</p>
<p>Daosheng Money Shop Robbed by Bandits: At around 7 p.m. last night, seven or eight thugs suddenly arrived at the Daosheng Money Shop next to the Qianye Guild Hall on Xiwu Street in this port.

Two of them stood guard at the door, while the rest swarmed inside, drew their pistols, threatened to silence them, and forced the shop staff to hand over the location of the hidden silver. The shop staff were forced to hand over the key to the silver cabinet, which contained 2,379 yuan in banknotes, 40 yuan in silver dollars, and 80 cents in small silver coins, all of which were robbed. An employee named Wang Mingruo was injured on the cheek by a pistol butt. During the search, there were three silver ingots inside, which were old and black.

<p>3.  Emphasis should be placed on production education. Our country has always had the saying "scholars are noble" and "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their bodies are governed by others." Because these old ideas are not easily broken, and because education has not been able to exert its social role, it often turns out that those who are educated are those who do not produce. This is especially true for educated women, who often see education as nothing more than a tool for gaining vanity. Therefore, graduates of various schools today tend to flock to the teaching profession, forming a circular education phenomenon. As a result, the longer the period of education, the higher their desire for life increases, and the more isolated they become from the production undertakings of society and the country. Is this not contrary to the Three People's Principles of education, which clearly aims to enrich the people's lives, support the survival of society, develop the national livelihood, and continue the life of the nation as the greatest goal? Therefore, from now on, we must pay attention to increasing vocational subjects in schools at all levels, attach importance to labor practice, introduce the ideas of public production and shared enjoyment, and cultivate the spirit of teamwork. We must integrate education with society, hoping to achieve the realm of "education is life" and "education is production." Only then can we say that we are increasing domestic production and reducing domestic consumption. Only then will the power of education to save the country become more truly apparent. 4. Military education should be vigorously implemented. I still remember that in the early years of the Republic of China, our primary and secondary schools all had a gun drill subject. Recently, it has changed to emphasize only unarmed exercises. Although since last autumn, there have been new facilities for military training in middle schools, specialized schools, and universities, it is feared that these are only formalities due to the urgency of the matter. When the Shanghai War broke out, hundreds of people actually volunteered to sacrifice themselves for the country on the front lines. Unfortunately, the total number of people was too small to be of much help. I hope that from now on, all primary schools will focus on health exercises, especially Boy Scout training. In addition to intensifying Boy Scout training in secondary and higher schools, military training should also be vigorously implemented. Those who fail the military training should not be allowed to graduate. If this is done for several years, I dare to believe that today's students will all be loyal and brave patriots in the future. Once there is a disturbance on the border, they will definitely step forward and organize student armies to be the vanguard of the people, preventing the enemy from crossing the Lei Pool boundary by even one step. Only then will the power of education to save the country become more sufficient.</p>
<p>Alas, deep worries inspire sages, and many difficulties revive a nation. Looking at the Franco-Prussian War and the Russo-Japanese War, it is enough to prove that education is not only enough to save the country, but also to revive it. Therefore, what should educational colleagues who bear the mission of tomorrow's China do?</p>
<p>Let us pledge to work together diligently to fulfill our responsibilities, so as not to fail the expectations of our country and nation! (The End)</p>

<p>Yesterday, Portugal was Eliminated in Straight Sets</p>
<p>The final is scheduled to be against England this Sunday</p>
<p>The Robert Cup International Tennis Doubles Tournament was held yesterday at the China Tennis Court for the semi-finals between China and Portugal. Although tickets were sold for 6角 per person, the audience still reached six or seven hundred people. Chinese players Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua defeated Portugal's Kanavalo and H. Kolasa with scores of 6-1, 8-6, and 6-4. China has thus won the final. The final is scheduled to be against the British team at the French Club this Sunday. The situation of the Robert Cup and the progress of yesterday's competition are as follows:</p>
<p>United States Portugal 3-0 Portugal China 3-0 China Germany England 3-0 England Final on Sunday</p>
<p>Qiu and Lin Started Very Smoothly: China's Lin Baohua served first, and the ball was as heavy as a cannonball, achieving miraculous results every time. In addition, Qiu Feihai's net interception focused on Kolasa's offense. Although the Kolasa and Kanavalo were steady and resilient, they ultimately achieved nothing. After China won four consecutive games, Portugal finally won one game. As a result, the Chinese team won the set 6-1, which was extremely easy.</p>
<p>Portuguese Players Focused on One Side: The two Chinese players, Qiu and Lin, are both good at the right court, but not good at the left court. The Portuguese players noticed the weakness and focused their attack on the left court, and their momentum was very fierce. Therefore, the set suddenly became tense. Portugal even used high balls to attack the rear of Lin and Qiu, but the gains and losses were balanced. Portugal took the lead with a score of 2-1. After Lin and Qiu added two games, the situation changed. But Portugal also added two games, making it 4-3, with Lin and Qiu behind. Then it became 5-4, 5-5, and 6-5. The Portuguese players took the lead step by step, with a momentum to complete the game in one go. Lin and Qiu resisted cautiously, and their net interception was very skillful. The Portuguese players used their old trick again, hoping to use high balls to hit the rear of Lin and Qiu, but many balls went out of bounds, resulting in a score of 6-6. After Lin and Qiu captured this pass, their spirits were lifted. They won two consecutive games and ended the set with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>Wonderful Performances Completed the Gong: The competition in the third set was the most exciting. Kanavalo served, which was very lonely. Lin and Qiu smashed four shots, all of which went out of bounds. The Portuguese then got the first game. Qiu lost another game due to his weak serve. Fortunately, he immediately won back two games. Kanavalo served, and Lin and Qiu lost four balls in a row again. The Portuguese players won the game with a score of 3-2. After reaching 3-3, Lin and Qiu took the lead. In the eighth game, the competition was particularly fierce, with ties for seven or eight times, either short-range or long-range challenges. The Portuguese players sometimes returned the ball with a high ball, and Lin and Qiu respected them with a high pressure. The situation was tense, with mutual gains and losses. Kanavalo focused on intercepting the net on the left court, achieving many victories. However, Lin's serve was also a major problem for the opponent, and Qiu's net placement was often ingenious. As a result of the game, it still belonged to Lin and Qiu. After each added a game, the score became 6-4, and Lin and Qiu completed their mission.</p>
<p>The China-England Final on Sunday: After China eliminated Portugal, it won the right to the final against England. Although the pairing of Lin and Qiu is like adding flowers to brocade and a perfect match, the British players De Fu and Huiter are both famous doubles players, which is very strong. The final between the two teams will be held at the French Club this Sunday, and Lin and Qiu are not allowed to visit.</p>

<p>Because European Football Matches are Very Common</p>
<p>They Must Help Economically at the Games</p>
<p>Reuters London, 7th - The next World Alimbeek Games will be held in Berlin, Germany in 1936. The German Organizing Committee is strongly advocating for the restoration of football as a competition item in the next Games. At the same time, the competent authorities of various European countries have inquired about matters concerning the participating teams. The reason for restoring football matches is because football matches are felt to be a very common sports competition in Europe, and they must help with the economic problems of the Alimbeek Games. According to this edition, there are no football matches in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Big Problem is Subsidizing Players</p>
<p>| Opinion of the President of the French Football Association |</p>
<p>Remede, President of the French Football Association, published an opinion in the "Otto" newspaper, saying that although the International Alimbeek Committee is against subsidizing football players' time loss, if the United States agrees to have this competition, the committee will definitely abandon its opposition. Football is not very common in the United States, so it will not affect the economy of the Games. In 1928, the International Football Association requested subsidies for football players' time loss, but the International Alimbeek Committee did not agree with this principle, and the organizing committee of the Games claimed that if there were no football matches, the success of the Games would be damaged. The attitude of the Alimbeek Committee has changed, so it is believed that if the organizing committee continues to insist on the principle of subsidizing players' time loss, it will definitely be accepted at the time.</p>

<p>Champion Yu Tianguang, Runner-up Tu Kaiyuan</p>
<p>Third Army Qian Yaobin, Fourth Army Undetermined</p>
<p>The Second Youyou Cup has ended, and the first, second, and third places have also been determined. However, the scores of the fourth-place Liang Deguang and Ma Anquan are the same and must be replayed to determine the winner. The replay is now scheduled for 3:00 PM this Saturday. Before the end of this event, it was impossible to make a decision on each army in advance. Now Yu Tianguang has maintained the championship title with 29 points, and it is no coincidence that he has won the championship for two consecutive years. Tu Kaiyuan's skills have improved compared to last year, but unfortunately, he was distracted by summer football, so he could not go all the way to the end. Otherwise, he could have competed with Yu Tianguang for the top spot. Qian Yaobin initially followed behind and did not show effort, but after entering, he strived to improve and still ranked third, which is not easy. Qian's technique this year is more stable than last year. If Liang Deguang had worked hard in the previous few matches, he could have won Qian's third place. It is a pity that he still has to replay with Ma Anquan. It is reported that after the singles ended, a side activity was initiated, that is, the six people from the first to sixth place in this singles will each draw one of the six people from the seventh to twelfth place to pair up for doubles, and adopt an elimination system. The championship group will still be presented with a silver cup by Cheng Yize, the president of the association, as a souvenir. The overall results of each individual are as follows:</p>
<p>Name Points Lost Points Name Points Lost Points</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang 29 4 Tu Kaiyuan 25 8</p>

<p>Now that the autumn is cool and the air is refreshing, volleyball is the most suitable sport. The Chinese YMCA has previously held a men's volleyball league with satisfactory results.

Therefore, taking advantage of the opening of various schools, the women's volleyball league has been initiated. Registration starts today and ends on the 15th of this month. Each team is limited to 14 people, and must pay a registration fee of 2 yuan at the same time. The competition will start on the 17th of this month. After that, it will be held every Saturday afternoon in the association's gym. This year's single round-robin system will be adopted. When necessary, the scores will be divided into Group A and Group B. The championship team of this year will be awarded a silver cup by the association.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Minister Song Returned to Shanghai from Haizhou Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Rectifies the Salt Administration of Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>400,000 Yuan for Dredging Rivers</p>
<p>1,000,000 Yuan for Building Salt Barns</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Finance and Acting Premier Song Ziwen, considering that the Haizhou area of ​​Northern Jiangsu is the largest salt-producing region in our country, is determined to rectify it and plans to establish salt barns (i.e., salt warehouses) in the area to centralize production, prevent smuggling, and increase tax revenue. Therefore, he specially took a Sikorsky aircraft the day before yesterday, accompanied by Zhu Tingqi, Director of the Salt Affairs Department and concurrently Chief of the General Auditing Office, and Huang Chun Tao, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, to inspect the Haizhou area and review the Tax Police Corps under the Ministry of Finance. He returned to Shanghai by the original aircraft at 3:30 p.m. yesterday and gave the following conversation to the Central News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Inspection Situation: Mr. Song and his party departed from Shanghai by plane on the morning of the day before yesterday and arrived in Haizhou at 12:00 noon. They inspected the salt districts of Xinpu and Dapu in Haizhou. They stayed in Haizhou City that night and went to various salt districts for inspection again at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. At 12:30 noon, he accompanied Director Zhu, Secretary Huang, and Commander Zhao of the Tax Police Corps back to Shanghai by the original aircraft. At 3:30 p.m., they arrived safely at Hongqiao Airport, where they were greeted by Mr. Song's guards and took two cars to return to his private residence on Qiqi Road.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's Speech: After Mr. Song got off the plane, the Central News Agency reporter immediately asked about the situation of the salt district inspection and the rectification policy in the Haizhou area of ​​Northern Jiangsu. According to Mr. Song, he believed that the Northern Jiangsu area was the most important salt-producing region in our country, so he specially accompanied Director Zhu and others to fly to Haizhou and other places to inspect the new salt fields and review the Tax Police Corps stationed there. Mr. Song was tired from the journey and needed to rest urgently, so he asked the reporter to go along for details. After arriving at Mr. Song's residence, a secretary who accompanied Mr. Song on the inspection told the reporter about the Ministry of Finance's salt affairs rectification situation.</p>
<p>Rectification Plan: According to the talk, the area inspected this time was Xinpu, Xinpu, and Dapu in Haizhou. Other areas could not be inspected one by one due to time constraints. Haizhou is located on the coast of the Yellow Sea, Xinpu in the east, and Dapu further east. Xinpu and Dapu are both rising grounds, and many new salt fields have been built. Northern Jiangsu is the richest salt-producing area in our country, and the salt produced in the Haizhou area is even more excellent. Dapu is the terminal of the Longhai Railway, so the salt production can be sold smoothly in several provinces. However, in recent years, due to the rise of bandits in the area and the obstruction of transportation, sales have been hindered, and tax revenue has also decreased. The Ministry of Finance has planned a fund of 1.4 million yuan for the rectification of salt affairs in Northern Jiangsu, with 400,000 yuan for dredging rivers to facilitate transportation, and the remaining 1 million yuan for the construction of salt barns. Salt barns are warehouses for storing salt, which will centralize all production to prevent smuggling and increase tax revenue. The salt barns that have been built in the area include five large salt barns and four small salt barns. After the completion of the project, the salt tax can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Tax Police: The Tax Police Corps under the Ministry of Finance, led by Commander Mo Xiong, went to Haizhou and then went to various places to suppress bandits. According to local people, the bandit situation near Haizhou was so severe that there was a risk of being robbed by bandits 50 steps outside the city of Haizhou. Since entering the bandit suppression, the bandit forces have been reduced, and the residents are safe. However, the regiment suffered some casualties due to its efforts to suppress bandits. One battalion commander and one company commander have died in battle. As for Commander Zhao, who accompanied Mr. Song to Shanghai, he took leave to return to his hometown in Shanghai. Mr. Song has not yet determined the exact date of his return to Nanjing.</p>

<p>The September 18th Incident in the Northeast Province, in the blink of an eye, is the anniversary. It is reported that the Executive Committee of this city, in accordance with the telegram of the Central Executive Committee, announced that all entertainment activities nationwide will be suspended on this day. All party members, civil servants, military police, various agencies, schools, factories, shops, and residents should suspend work for five minutes at 11:00 a.m. to stand in silence and swear to avenge the national humiliation, and to express deep condolences to those who died in the Northeast and Shanghai battles. This is specially announced in the newspaper to inform all circles. It is also heard that all circles will hold memorial services on this day, which is expected to be a solemn and enthusiastic event at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e111">After Ariyoshi's Visit to China, Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations are Widely Rumored <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>But Diplomatic Figures Observe</p>
<p>Saying it is Japanese Diplomatic Tactics</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, regarding the issue of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, since the arrival of the new Japanese Minister to China, Ariyoshi Akira, the rumors have been rampant. The Japanese Minister has stated that direct negotiations between China and Japan are possible, but the Chinese government and the public have expressed that it is still too early. The reporter yesterday specially visited an important figure in the diplomatic circle and asked whether direct negotiations could become a reality. According to the answer, the ill feeling between China and Japan has a long history. Before the January 28th Incident, there was a trend of direct negotiations. Later, due to the arrogance of the Japanese side, China appealed to the League of Nations, believing that justice belonged to us, and waited for a solution. Now that the League of Nations General Assembly is approaching, Japan has sent Ariyoshi to China to carry out direct negotiations in order to ease the international atmosphere. This is just a diplomatic tactic of Japan towards China. In short, it is not appropriate to talk about direct negotiations before the League of Nations General Assembly is held. The reporter then inquired about the latest news of the case from foreigners. It is heard that Ariyoshi is in contact, and if there are no major changes in the middle, direct Sino-Japanese negotiations can be realized before and after the League of Nations General Assembly. Let's record it for confirmation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Jin Wensi has arrived in Shanghai from Peiping <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to go to Europe on the 20th</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Jin Wensi, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, has not taken office as the Minister to the Netherlands after being appointed by the National Government because of his weak body and unfamiliarity with overseas life. However, after the September 18th Incident, Jin Wensi felt that the country was in extreme danger and should not sit idly by. When the League of Nations Investigation Team came to China, he risked his life and accompanied Dr. Gu Shaochuan to go out of the customs with the League of Nations Investigation Team, experiencing all kinds of hardships. This time, the League of Nations Investigation Team handled the result report in Peiping. The Chinese side's reports and memorandum reached more than 50 pieces, all of which were reviewed and drafted by Mr. Jin together with Mr. Gu. Now that Mr. Gu is going to France as an envoy and will represent the National Government to participate in the League of Nations meeting to be held in Geneva, and strive for the Northeast issue, Mr. Gu asked Mr. Jin to go to Geneva at that time to assist him. Mr. Jin has arrived here by train from Peiping the night before yesterday and is scheduled to go abroad by the British ship Rauchi on the 20th, first to Marseille and then by train to Geneva. His wife will travel to Europe with him and is preparing for the trip. The reporter of the Far East News Agency specially drove to visit Mr. Jin's residence yesterday. Here, the important points of his conversation are recorded below: (Reporter: Mr. Minister, you came here from Peiping. Can you tell us about the current situation in North China? (Mr. Jin replied) Although the current situation in North China is in a dangerous situation, it is not as prevalent as the rumors outside. It is like the sea a few days ago, which is also in a state of alarm, but so far there has been no change, which shows that the rumors are not reliable. The Japanese army has learned a profound lesson from the previous Shanghai war and feels very bored. Therefore, in addition to carrying out various demonstrations everywhere to achieve its ambitions for political action, it has no great significance. However, North China is still maintained by Mr. Zhang Xueliang, and all generals are absolutely obedient and obey his command. (Question) Japan's invasion of Rehe is becoming more and more urgent. Is there a saying that it will launch a large-scale attack on September 18th? Did you hear about it in Peiping? (Answer) Japan has been planning for Rehe for a long time. The pseudo-organization's map has long included Rehe Province. A large-scale attack is only a matter of time, so it may not be on September 18th. (Question) Then what are the authorities of Rehe and Hebei planning to do about this? (Answer) Of course, they are preparing to resist, but the specific measures are military secrets, and outsiders cannot know. (Question) What arrangements is Japan making for the upcoming League of Nations meeting? (Answer) This is really difficult to know, but it is expected that it will ignore everything and be tough to the end. (Question) What is the purpose of Ariyoshi's visit to China? Is it true that he will conduct direct negotiations with the National Government? (Answer) Ariyoshi is the Japanese Minister to China. Before the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are severed, it is a very common thing for the two countries to send ministers to each other, and it cannot be said that he is conducting direct negotiations. However, Ariyoshi recently made a statement, in which he said, "I hope that the Chinese side will observe and resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute with a long-term vision," etc. This is really no different from saying that our government can quickly recognize the Manchurian pseudo-organization as a buffer zone for the Sino-Japanese struggle, so as to eliminate ill feeling invisibly and gradually increase the friendship between the two countries. The so-called long-term vision can be explained by this. This kind of remark is absurd. His main mission here can be imagined by this. (Question) What is your opinion on direct negotiations? (Answer) Direct negotiations are not equal to betraying national sovereignty and humiliating the country. For example, when two people are in dispute, they must first reason with each other. If they do not follow the right path, they will fight each other. When fighting still cannot be resolved, then they will ask a third party to intervene. The so-called reasoning and the so-called mutual fighting are all direct negotiations. Therefore, the so-called directness is a necessary step. However, our country has lost the opportunity for direct negotiations at present. After the Shenyang Incident, the Japanese were afraid of intervention by various countries, so they eagerly sought direct negotiations to end the matter. However, the public was deeply afraid that the government would betray the country and strongly opposed it. By now, the Japanese forces in the Northeast have been deeply entrenched, and the pseudo-organization has been established, and there is no room for further direct negotiations with me. Therefore, observing the current attitude of the Japanese, they actually want our country to negotiate with the pseudo-organization, which is what our people can tolerate. Finally, Mr. Jin told the reporter again that the focus of diplomacy has shifted to the League of Nations, and the focus of the League of Nations is actually in the United States. Therefore, in the future, I hope that the comrades in the press can pay attention to this point, and strive to advocate friendship in the Sino-US relations. Moreover, we should establish a strong and independent proposition to express our own definite attitude. If we ourselves cannot have a strong expression, even if a third party wants to help, there is no way.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Association for the Support of the League of Nations Covenant Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Jointly Promote the Process <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams to the Central Government to Instruct the Representatives Attending the League of Nations</p>
<p>Suggesting that Member States Implement Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>The Municipal Association for the Support of the League of Nations Covenant, considering that the League of Nations is about to be held, has specially telegraphed to the Central Government to instruct the representatives of our country to suggest that the member states of the League of Nations implement economic sanctions against Japan in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant to show sanctions. In order to exert its effectiveness, the association also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the highest commercial body in the city, for its support and joint promotion. The original text is recorded as follows: (1) Central Executive Committee, National Government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dear Sirs, Since September 18th last year, Japan disregarded international conventions and practices and suddenly used the means of undeclared war to occupy our Liaoning and Jilin, and even followed the old trick of annexing Korea to organize the Manchurian pseudo-state, violently trampling on the four northeastern provinces. Although the League of Nations has resolved twice to order the withdrawal of troops, the Japanese not only did not fulfill their promises, but dared to intensify their efforts. Now they are blatantly declaring that they will formally recognize the puppet organization in the Northeast, expressing their refusal to international intervention. If sanctions are not imposed for such destruction of the Covenant and recklessness, justice will be destroyed and violence will prevail. The animalistic behavior will be rampant, and the iron hooves will be rampant. Our country will suffer great misfortune. May I ask what the countries of the world will rely on and not fear? The reason why countries are fortunate to have peace and avoid the scourge of war is due to the guarantee of international treaties. Therefore, the role of treaties in stopping chaos is like the role of dikes in preventing rivers. If the dikes break, floods will come immediately. If the covenants are destroyed, wars will arise. Treaties are sacred and cannot be arbitrarily destroyed by any excuse. Once destroyed, the consequences are unimaginable. The Association, in view of this, based on the principle of free trade and the spirit of peaceful struggle, is carrying out the movement to support the League of Nations Covenant in the absence of any other options. The only purpose is to implement the severance of all economic relations with Japan. According to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, all member states have the obligation to impose economic sanctions on aggressors. The Association believes that this article is an effective method to sanction the violent Japanese and should be upheld at all costs to promote its realization. Now that the League of Nations is about to be held, we specially telegraph to your organization to instruct the representatives of our country to quickly suggest that the member states implement economic sanctions against Japan to show sanctions. If the ambitious are punished, justice and humanity will eventually be extended, and world peace will be achieved. The Association for the Support of the League of Nations Covenant bows in indignation. (2) Dear Sirs, The Association, in view of the active advance of the violent Japanese in the East and the ever-increasing aggression, has learned from the pain and felt that the country is about to perish. Based on the principle of self-determination of merchants and free trade, the Association is formed by the trade unions of various industries. The only purpose is to concentrate the strength of merchants and implement economic sanctions against Japan in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, hoping to give the violent Japanese a punishment and repay the country by one in ten thousand. Your Association is the highest authority of commerce in the city and the supreme leader of merchants. In recent years, you have led the merchants in their efforts to resist insults and save the country, and your achievements are remarkable. The Association expresses its infinite sympathy for this movement and hopes that you will not hesitate to give your advice and sincere guidance and assistance to jointly promote the process, which will not only be the honor of the Association. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce,</p>
<h3 id="e114">Director Wen Hongen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Took Office Yesterday Morning <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Announced a Large Number of New Staff Members</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, took office at the bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Those who went with him included Yin Rugeng, a consultant of the Municipal Government, Sun Pu, the chief of the First Section, and the secretaries Wang Shaozhai and Chen Kecheng. All the staff members of the bureau's departments, sections, and teams, as well as the chiefs of various districts and the police officers of the First Company of the Police Brigade, were dressed up to welcome him. After Director Wen arrived at the bureau, he was handed over by Zhen Shao, the former chief of the First Section, on behalf of the former Director Wen. After Director Wen received the important documents and seals, he addressed all the staff members in the front yard of the office hall and took a photo with the Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen taking office (presented by Mr. Zhu Shunlin).</p>
<p>Officially announced the newly appointed staff members. The list of staff members who were addressed is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Director Wen's Speech: Comrades, today I am appointed by the Mayor to take the position of Director of the Public Security Bureau and meet with you for the first time. I would like to say a few important words to you first. The duties of the Public Security Bureau are to enforce national laws and maintain social order. Everyone knows that it is the highest-level police agency in the city and has the closest relationship with the people of the society. Its position is so important. In other words, if the Public Security Bureau is not managed well and the things that should be done cannot be done, the municipal administration will definitely not be good. It can be said that to make the Public Security Bureau well-managed, to assist the municipal construction, and to promote local autonomy, the people will be happy, and we will have fulfilled our responsibilities. This responsibility is not only for the Director or a few staff members, but for all staff members, even every police officer, to shoulder together. From the Director to the police officer, everyone can work together with one heart and one mind to be responsible. The entire Public Security Bureau can have the hope of achieving its tasks and completing its mission. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and international relations are very complicated. There are many special circumstances that are different from the inland. Therefore, the work of the Public Security Bureau is particularly heavy. Over the years, the directors of the Public Security Bureau have achieved remarkable results and have made progress compared to the past. After Director Wen's reorganization, it has made even more progress. However, since the "January 28th" Incident, the situation in Shanghai has become more tense and the position has become more important. The most important thing now is to eliminate foreign excuses and correct international views. Therefore, our responsibility is particularly heavy. How should we fulfill our responsibility? First, we must have the spirit of service; second, we must have agile skills; third, we must have integrity. What I have said above is just some of my ideas. In the future, we will have many opportunities to meet, and we can always bring them up for everyone to work hard. Recently, rumors are rampant, and people are panicked. The responsibility of all of us is even greater. I hope everyone will work harder. I am a soldier and believe that as long as everything can be done "seriously," there is nothing that is difficult to handle. All colleagues in the bureau and the chiefs of various districts and stations have been serving for a long time, and their academic knowledge and experience are quite considerable. Please feel at ease to serve, and do not doubt. It is my hope that you will still handle things as Director Wen did.</p>
<p>List of New Staff Members: Sun Pu, Director of the Secretariat; Yu Honglan, Secretary; Chen Zhuomin, Secretary; Li Mo, Chief of the First Section; Wang Zhijing, Chief of the Second Section (formerly in office); Pan Geya, Chief of the Third Section; Zeng Wangxiong, Director of Accounting; Wei Furu, Director of General Affairs; Ma Zhunian, Director of the Stolen Goods Collection and Release Section; Huang Zuyao, Inspector of Seals. Although Gong Xikui, the Chief Inspector, has resigned to the new Director, he is still retained.</p>
<p>Proclamation of Taking Office: After taking office, Mr. Wen immediately issued a proclamation saying, "For the proclamation, in the order of the Municipal Government No. 287, it is stated that Wen Yingxing, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, is approved to resign, and Wen Hongen is appointed as the acting replacement. In addition to submitting a resume, you should first report to work and take charge. This order, etc., is hereby followed. The Director of this Bureau took office on the 8th of this month. In addition to reporting and distributing it, it is hereby announced for the information of all."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Japanese Residents Still Trying to Oppose the Implementation of the Consular Visa System <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since our Customs announced the implementation of the regulations on consular visa for cargo transportation on September 1st, foreign merchants in Shanghai have shown no opposition, but Japanese merchants are still actively opposing it, and have falsely cited five points as reasons for their opposition. Details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Requesting Japanese Minister to Negotiate: The Japanese Chamber of Commerce, various road business associations, the Textile Federation, and other commercial organizations have held meetings for days to discuss countermeasures against the consular visa system announced and implemented by our government. Since the new Japanese Minister to China, Arima, arrived in Shanghai, their activities have become even more active. On the day after Arima's arrival, Yasui, the acting administrative chairman of the Japanese Residents' Group, Ichimachi, the vice president of various road business associations (because the president, Hayashi Yoshiwo, has not returned from Japan), and others, representing all Japanese merchants in Shanghai, met with Arima and requested him to propose the abolition of the consular visa system to us. The outcome is unknown due to the confidential nature of the content.</p>
<p>Reasons for Japanese Merchants' Opposition: As a result of the Japanese merchants' meetings for days, the following five points have been decided as reasons for opposition: (1) The procedure is troublesome and hinders trade with China. (2) The system is a means of resisting Japanese goods. (3) The visa fee is excessive and places an excessive burden on Japanese merchants. (4) The system is, in fact, a disguised increase in tariffs. (5) Chinese consuls stationed abroad are corrupt and untrustworthy. If the consular visa system is allowed to be implemented, Japanese merchants will be subjected to a major oppression in the future. In addition to the above five items, there are also various other absurd remarks to confuse foreign merchants and hope to achieve their conspiracy.</p>
<p>Failure to Contact Foreign Merchants: Before the Shanghai Customs announced the implementation of the consular visa system for overseas consuls, Japanese merchants in Shanghai had already expressed obvious opposition, and even published a letter to friendly foreign merchants, hoping to contact merchants from friendly countries to take unified action against it. However, foreign merchants generally believed that our new system had sufficient reasons, and that tariffs had already been autonomously set, so there was no room for opposition. Therefore, they all rejected the Japanese rhetoric and followed the new system. It is said that Japanese merchants have realized that this plan has completely failed and have decided to take individual action in an attempt to make a final struggle.</p>
<p>Protesting the Establishment of Branch Offices: Since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the establishment of consular branch offices or offices on September 1 to expedite the consular visa system, our Ministry has successively sent personnel to Osaka, Kobe, Taiwan, and other places in Japan to prepare for the establishment of branch offices. They have now all been declared established and have begun issuing cargo transportation certificates. However, the Japanese government has used the excuse that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not obtain Japanese consent in advance to establish branch offices in the aforementioned places and intends to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to us, demanding its cancellation. It is also said that this proposal is also a suggestion contributed by Japanese merchants in Shanghai to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Places Arrive in Shanghai: For the purpose of collectively deliberating on appropriate measures to oppose our implementation of the consular visa system, Japanese commercial organizations in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Ping are said to have sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate everything. After the representatives from various places arrive, Japanese commercial organizations in Shanghai will hold a "Joint Conference of Japanese Merchant Representatives from Various Places" on a scheduled basis to discuss the method in detail.</p>

<p>Inviting Silver and Money Industry Representatives to Visit</p>
<p>Since the new Director Guo took office at the Central Mint, a trial run of the machinery was conducted yesterday afternoon. Vice President Chen of the Central Bank, Director Xu of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and leaders of the silver and money industry and industrial circles, including Li Jue, Xi Demao, Qin Runqing, Tang Shoumin, Liu Jisheng, Ye Qifeng, and Westerners Geng Aidi and Masu from the Abolish Taels and Change to Yuan Committee, as well as more than a hundred Chinese and foreign guests, were invited to visit the factory. After 2 pm, they arrived one after another, and Director Guo and Deputy Directors Wei and Wang sincerely received them and guided them to visit various factories, explaining each one in detail. Many praised the factory's complete equipment and the machinery's novelty, sensitivity, and accuracy, not only being the best in China, but also comparable to those in European and American countries. The trial run ended at 5 pm, and they returned.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Japanese Special Police Chief Koketsu Yasomi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Another 300 Japanese Marines Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, all Japanese residents in Shanghai, considering the outbreak of patriotic movements among our people, had requested the Japanese government to expand the Japanese police organization in Shanghai to ensure the security of cargo transportation by force. The Japanese authorities approved this request and appointed Koketsu Yasomi as the chief of the Shanghai Special Police Department to prepare for the expansion. It is learned that Koketsu Yasomi arrived in Shanghai on the Shunyo Maru from Kobe at around 11 am yesterday, accompanied by 80 Japanese police officers. After arriving in Shanghai, Koketsu Yasomi delivered an absurd speech to the Japanese resident representatives who welcomed him at the pier in the afternoon at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, stating that the police department attached to the Japanese Consulate General is currently small in scope and the number of police officers is insufficient. Therefore, it has been decided to build a new house opposite the consulate, which will be named "Shanghai Japanese Special Police Department." The number of police officers will be expanded from 120 to 320, and it will be divided into five departments: Thought Department, Mobile Department, Detective Department, Patrol Department, and Intelligence Department. The main purpose is to strictly suppress anti-Japanese movements and Korean independence thought in China.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that at 5:15 pm yesterday, the Japanese warship Nojima arrived and brought 300 Japanese marines, who landed at the Osaka Shosen Wharf, boarded multiple trucks, and went straight to the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps in Jiangwan.</p>

<p>300,000 Compatriots in Distress</p>
<p>Cotton Clothing Urgently Needed Due to Cold Weather</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan telegraphed various circles in this city from Peiping yesterday, stating: "Since the September 18th Incident, our compatriots in Northeast China have lost their homes and property. To this day, the number of refugees who are inadequately clothed and fed is increasing day by day. The reason why they endure hardship, struggle with hunger and cold, and vow not to leave hastily is nothing more than their love for their homeland and hope to restore their former residences. Their aspirations are truly worthy of sympathy. According to current surveys, the number has reached 300,000. Those who come to beg for relief are endless. The weather in the border area is turning cold, and cotton clothing is especially urgently needed. If there are no relief measures, they will inevitably all be abandoned in ditches, which is a matter of great concern. I sincerely hope that my colleagues in your esteemed place will consider the difficulties of the times and enthusiastically undertake righteous deeds. I earnestly request that you strongly advocate and quickly donate warm clothing or funds to help them. It is hoped that the wind of benevolence will warm and comfort them. I send this telegram urgently and express my gratitude and anticipation. Zhu Qinglan bows, Yang, Qiao."</p>

<p>The Shantou Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association is the only group in eastern Guangdong that advocates for domestic products. In recent years, in addition to vigorously advocating for domestic products and finding ways to maintain them, it has also actively planned to establish a large-scale domestic goods exhibition hall in Shantou to promote the development of the domestic goods movement. Therefore, it specifically sent representative Cai Xiaotian north this time to investigate the actual situation of domestic products in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After Mr. Cai arrived in Shanghai, he received news that Zhejiang Province was holding a large-scale domestic goods movement in Hangzhou, so he made a special trip to Hangzhou to investigate and visit the Zhejiang Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall, which is famous throughout Jiangnan and Jiangbei. He returned to Shanghai yesterday on a special train from Hangzhou. According to Cai, the rise of domestic products in recent years has been sufficient to meet the needs of people's livelihoods. The most regrettable thing is the lack of effort by Chinese people to advocate for their use. If Chinese people can make an effort to advocate for their use, why worry about not being able to regain the domestic sales market and plug countless leaks?</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Workers of Xu Chongdao Resumed Work Yesterday Morning <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Another Twist Arises</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after the entire staff of Xu Chongdao announced a general strike, they decided to resume work at 8:30 am yesterday after repeated persuasion by representatives of the Party Department. However, the management temporarily wanted to dismiss the main figures who instigated the strike, which led to another twist.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: All employees went to each branch of the head office at 8 am yesterday and worked as usual. Unexpectedly, the management posted a notice in the head office stating that it was necessary to dismiss Cen Yongkang, Zhou Gang, Zhong Jiren, Yang Xikui, Shao Bingxiang, Sun Zhengkui, and six other leaders of the strike, which caused dissatisfaction among all employees. The group representatives Zhong Jiren, Yang Xikui, and others went to the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to request negotiation. After the union convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors, it was decided to petition the Party and government agencies.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party and Government: Zhao Zhenhui, Fang Qingjian, and other members of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, as well as Yang Xikui, Zhong Jiren, and other representatives of the Xu Chongdao group, went to the Party and government agencies at 11 am yesterday to petition, stating that the management violated the principle of resumption of work and dismissed six workers without reason, requesting strict prohibition. Section Chief Xu Yefu of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau received them and promised to be responsible for negotiating with the store and not to violate the principle of resumption of work or cause other disputes. Later, the representatives went to the Municipal Party Department to petition, where Director Wang Manyun of the People's Training Section received them. After inquiring about the situation in detail, he immediately sent staff member Li Weibing to the store to negotiate.</p>
<p>General Assembly: After the employees followed the instructions of the Party Department yesterday morning and went to work in various branches of the head office, the store unexpectedly posted a notice wanting to dismiss Cen Yongkang and six other employees. They immediately sent representatives to report to the union, requesting strict negotiations, and decided to hold a general assembly at the Second District Branch at 9 pm last night to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Union's Statement: According to the person in charge of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, who told the Dagong News Agency reporter, the entire staff of Xu Chongdao reluctantly accepted the persuasion of the Party and government and resumed work as ordered. Unexpectedly, the management believed that the strike was illegal and insisted on dismissing the six instigators, which caused dissatisfaction among all employees. It was found that before the resumption of work, four principles had been decided with the management, but they were now violating them without reason, going back on their word, and the responsibility should be borne by the management. In short, the union sincerely hopes to settle the matter and does not want to cause further incidents. If the management does not understand the difficulties and insists on dismissing them, the union will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and lead all the pharmaceutical workers in Shanghai to support the employees of Xu Chongdao.</p>
<p>Store's Attitude: The entire staff of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store automatically and unconditionally returned to work at the store at 8:30 am yesterday. The labor unrest was resolved as reported. However, the store is still strictly investigating the leaders who instigated the strike. Once the facts are verified, it will still be reported to the Party and government authorities for legal punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e125">News on Labor Disputes at the China Merchants Electric Company <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Due to labor disputes at the China Merchants Electric Company, former executive members Zhu Hanhe, Tang Junsheng, Zhou Guangrong, Zhang Ruoyu, and other workers had temporarily requested leave and stopped working. The company and higher authorities have mediated between the two sides for many days, but a real solution has not yet been reached. It is now learned that the inspectors on leave, Zhu Hanhe, Zhou Guangrong, Zhang Ruoyu, and the driver Tang Junsheng, returned to the company yesterday to cancel their leave and work as usual. Unexpectedly, at around 4 pm, someone suddenly threw dirty objects at inspector Zhu Hanhe at the corner of the Shanghai military camp, and then an incident occurred, and the tram stopped for a short time. Later, Lu Zhonglin, the acting director of transportation of the company, came forward to mediate and comfort both sides, and no major accident occurred and the tram continued to run as usual.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that the China Merchants Electric Company Trade Union had expelled Zhu Hanhe, Zhou Guangrong, and four other事務工 from the union for disrupting the union's actions and requested the company to dismiss Zhu Hanhe and the four others. The company stated that the Party and government authorities had long forbidden the evil precedent of dismissing workers because they were expelled from the union, so they could not open this precedent and replied to the union in a letter. Yesterday, Zhu Hanhe and others canceled their leave and went to work at the company, and a group of workers returned their copper badges to the company, expressing their unwillingness to cooperate with Zhu and others. Rumors spread, and the situation was quite serious. Union representatives Fu Chongde, Tan Honglin, and others relayed the workers' intentions to the company. It is heard that the China Merchants Electric Company still believes that the standard for dismissing employees should be whether they have committed serious misconduct in their service to the company. Otherwise, employees will lose their security and everyone will be in danger, which is not good for the workers.

<h3 id="e127">The Suiyang Steamer Caught Fire <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Ship's Hull Was Not Damaged, and the Passengers Were Safe</p>
<p>The Swire Group's Nan Wah liner Suiyang was on its way from Shanghai to Qingdao on the afternoon of the 7th of this month. When loading kerosene at the Guanghua Wharf, a fire broke out in the third cabin due to carelessness, destroying a batch of goods. The ship returned to Shanghai, and the situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>The Suiyang Steamer, bound for Qingdao, came to Shanghai from Hong Kong and Guangdong and entered the port on the 4th of this month. After unloading the goods, it was berthed at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong. On the 7th, it loaded export goods in Pudong and set off for Qingdao. This time, the goods transported by the ship to Jiaozhou were mainly paper and tea. The loading was completed at 2 pm on the 7th, and it set off for the Guanghua Kerosene Wharf in Gaolousha to transport kerosene to Qingdao.</p>
<p>Fire Broke Out in the Third Cabin: At about 4 pm, the Suiyang Steamer arrived at the Guanghua Wharf. After berthing, it opened the cabin to load oil. Unexpectedly, when the third cabin was opened, flames emerged from the cabin, indicating that a fire had broken out due to carelessness. Once the cabin door was opened and the air circulated, the fire suddenly erupted on the deck. Captain Barron immediately ordered all sailors and wharf workers to assist in using the ship's own firefighting equipment to try to put out the fire. However, the cabin was mostly filled with paper, and the fire was fierce and difficult to extinguish.</p>
<p>Customs Rescue: Because the fire was so fierce and difficult to extinguish, the captain hoisted a flag to warn. The Customs received the report and quickly sent a fire boat and firefighters to assist in the rescue. The Fire Brigade also sent fire trucks to assist in spraying water. At about 5 pm, the fire in the third cabin was extinguished. The cause of the fire is still unknown. It is probably caused by a worker leaving a cigarette butt and embers when loading the goods. Swire Group also sent personnel to the ship to inspect.</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai: After the fire in the ship was extinguished, the burned goods and the water-damaged goods had to be unloaded to the wharf, and the notary had to evaluate the number, etc. Therefore, the Suiyang Steamer could not sail to Qingdao again. Swire Group ordered it to return to Shanghai and still berth at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong. It was found that there were more than 2,700 pieces of cargo in the third cabin, mostly paper, but there was also tea. Yesterday, the burned paper was unloaded onto the wharf, and the loss of tea in the water-damaged goods was still small and could still be shipped by the original ship.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Losses: The loss of the burned goods was quite large. Swire has now notified the guests to first handle the摊水, and the amount of damage still needs to be investigated and estimated before it can be known. The hull of the ship was not damaged, but it needs to be repaired, so the export was postponed to the 10th. When the fire broke out, the passengers on the ship were able to safely disembark because the ship was berthed at the wharf and it was in the afternoon. After the embers were extinguished, they boarded the ship again, so there was no panic.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The God of Wealth Temple Lawsuit <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Donor Sues Incense Keeper's Wife for Encroaching on Property</p>
<p>Court Orders Clarification Before Further Hearing</p>
<p>On Wuding Road in western Shanghai, there is a public Temple of the God of Wealth, which has a long history. During the late Qing Dynasty, in the thirty-first year of the Guangxu era, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau filed a lawsuit against a Mr. Zhu who lived in the temple, claiming the temple was public property. However, they did not win the case, so Mr. Zhu remained in the temple. For more than twenty years since then, no further disputes arose. After Mr. Zhu died, his wife, Ms. Tan, continued to manage the temple. Recently, Ms. Tan renovated the temple and applied to the Land Bureau for a land license, which aroused opposition from Wu Zongjun, Xi Hongde, Zhang Facan, Tan Deming, Wu Xingeng, Xu Xingen, and others who claimed to be donors to the temple. They all stated that the temple was a local public temple, and that Ms. Zhu Tan actually wanted to drive out the Taoist priests in the position of an incense keeper, which no one could tolerate. Therefore, they hired lawyer Hong Shihao to file a lawsuit against Ms. Zhu Tan. The complaint stated: "The public Temple of the God of Wealth at 32 Wuding Road, originally named Yingxi Convent, was built by public donation from local believers and has a considerable history. Records from various ancient books since the Qing Dynasty show this clearly. The miscellaneous affairs within the temple have been managed by incense keepers hired by the temple owners. From the time the plaintiffs' ancestors donated funds to establish the temple until now, they have worshipped at the temple from time to time. They have only required the incense keepers to not neglect their duties and have not closely supervised them. Over the years, this has become a habit. However, they have never given up their shared right to the temple property. Unexpectedly, the defendant, who has long received the plaintiffs' kindness and relied on them for food and shelter in the temple, dared to covet the temple property in the position of an incense keeper. The defendant took over from her predecessor as the incense keeper and managed the temple affairs. Unexpectedly, over time, she became lax and turned from guest to host, regarding the public property as her own. She repeatedly attempted to deceive the land administration office to obtain a land deed. Seeing that the words 'public' were inscribed on the top of the land temple, making it impossible to justify her claim to private ownership, she did not hesitate to fabricate the absurd name of Zhu Gongli to fulfill her ambition to seize public property. She even brought lawsuits to court against fellow incense keepers. The defendant has now brazenly claimed that the public Temple of the God of Wealth is her own and is currently engaged in construction. Given this deliberate plan, the plaintiffs, for the sake of the public interest, cannot remain silent. Therefore, they have filed this lawsuit, earnestly requesting a judgment confirming that the property is a public temple property and granting a preliminary injunction to prohibit the construction of houses or other dispositions before the conclusion of the case, in order to avoid complications with third parties and difficulties in execution in the future." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong of the First Special District Local Court held a hearing. The defendant was defended by lawyer Zheng Wenkai. Lawyer Zheng argued that the plaintiffs' accusations lacked concrete evidence, and that the plaintiff representatives, listed in the complaint as one hundred and seventy people, had not provided detailed addresses or occupations. He then debated with the plaintiffs' lawyer, Hong Shihao, and presented evidence. Judge Shen then questioned the plaintiff, Wu Zongjun, and, because the other plaintiffs' statements were the same as Wu's, did not summon them one by one. He ordered a postponement for a thorough investigation and set a date for a continued hearing.</p>

<p>Xi'an-Lanzhou Section Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The trial flight of the Eurasia Air Line has been temporarily suspended due to unfavorable weather conditions. However, the original Shanghai-Lanzhou line is part of the entire Eurasia line and has already been in operation. According to the Eurasia Aviation Company authorities, the No. 6 aircraft, flying from Lanzhou to Beijing last week, crashed due to prolonged rain, water accumulation at the airport, loose ground, and unfavorable weather conditions. The aircraft was damaged, and the passengers suffered minor injuries. The company has now decided to temporarily suspend the Xi'an-Lanzhou section. Once the aircraft is repaired and the weather improves, the flights will resume according to schedule. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Luoyang-Xi'an section will continue to operate as usual according to the schedule, without any changes. The rumor that the decision has been made to suspend passenger services on this line is not true. Except for the Xi'an-Lanzhou section, which is suspended, the rest of the line is still operating as usual.</p>

<p>Cutting Off Water Supply Disregards Residents' Lives and Security</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association yesterday responded to a request from the 10th District Branch of the Citizens Federation of Shanghai by sending a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter from the 10th District Branch of the Citizens Federation of Shanghai, which states that members of the association, Chen Jingshen and He Le, and others from Changkang Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, received a notice from the Water Company on the 26th of last month stating that their landlord, Zhang Shaotang of Fengyi Company, had not paid the water bill and that the water supply would be cut off. The members did not pay attention to this because the landlord is responsible for the water bill. Unexpectedly, on September 2, the water supply was suddenly cut off. When they immediately questioned the landlord, they learned that he was using the non-payment of the water bill as leverage in the unresolved rent reduction issue. The members, because water is essential for life, immediately raised three hundred yuan for the July water bill and sent it to the Water Company, requesting immediate water supply. Unexpectedly, the company refused to accept it, disregarding the lives of the residents. Therefore, we are writing to you regarding this matter. The Water Company's obligation is to provide water to the residents, and its right is to receive water bills. Now that the water bill has been sent and not accepted, and the water supply has not been continued, the suspension of the water supply is only an excuse for the non-payment of the water bill. In fact, it may be under the direction of the landlord. This not only violates the contract between your Bureau and the Water Company, but also creates problems for human morality and public order. Based on the above, we respectfully request that your Bureau promptly order the Water Company to collect the water bill and quickly restore the water supply to maintain the lives and health of the residents."</p>

<p>Requesting Assistance from the Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Federation presented to the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters yesterday, stating: "We are respectfully writing to you regarding a letter from the Tenants Association of Taihe Street, Qiqihar Road, Gaolang Bridge, stating that since the establishment of the association, they have suffered all kinds of oppression from the landlord and have spared no effort in opposing the rent reduction movement, which is a reasonable demand of all tenants (the situation has been described in previous reports). The association believes the matter of who is in the right and who is in the wrong should be judged fairly by the court. Now the landlord disregards the law and adopts direct action, so the weak citizens will not be able to live peacefully under the oppression of money and violence. The Executive Committee has decided to present the case to you, requesting assistance to maintain the law."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Zhabei Shilu Businessmen's Association Appeals for Tenants of Shunji Lane <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei Shilu Businessmen's Association presented a document to the Municipal Government, stating: "We are presenting a case of unscrupulous landlords who disregard justice and oppress the common people, requesting strict sanctions to appease public anger and deter others from following suit. The tenants of Shunji Lane, Yuyingtang Road, Zhabei, Wang Axiang, Pan Yaoming, and others, came to the association weeping and begged for justice and assistance, stating that they were being illegally oppressed by the landlord, Chen Shunshan, and had nowhere to turn. After sending staff to investigate, it was confirmed that the landlord was oppressing the common people to an extreme extent. The lane is located north of the railway and was designated as Zone B under the ceasefire agreement. It is close to the Shanghai Railway Station, and the disaster situation during the recent catastrophe was extremely severe. The tenants requested that the landlord provide the same treatment as other lanes in the vicinity and waive rent for four months. The landlord only agreed to three months, which led to a dispute. The two sides insisted on their positions. The landlord filed a complaint with the Local Court, ordering them to pay off the arrears and vacate the premises. The tenants took the old rent for January to the court for payment, but the landlord refused to accept it, demanding that four months of old and new rent be paid at once and that everyone must vacate the premises. On September 3, the court was requested to seal up Wang Xiangtai's woodworking shop, and it was said that if the arrears were not paid off immediately and the premises vacated, everyone would be sealed up, causing great public anger among the tenants, who wanted to take drastic action and fight the landlord. The association did its best to dissuade them and mediated the dispute, but the landlord refused to agree. After the war, the government did not provide any assistance to the victims, and the landlord not only failed to sympathize but used such cruel means to destroy them. In terms of human feeling and justice, it is truly heartless. The tenants' request for a four-month rent waiver is not an exceptional demand. The other lanes in the vicinity, such as Huide Lane, Huachang Lane, Shende Lane, and the Tianbao Lane and Nanlin Lane south of the railway, all automatically waived rent for four months. The Beizhu Fan Lane even waived four and a half months. The Zishou Lane next door waived four months and then reduced rent by 30%. Is the disaster in this lane less severe that they must waive only one month less? Moreover, the landlord is not a puppet and should consider when the Japanese troops withdrew from Zone B. It is against humanity and justice to be so unreasonable. Wang Xiangtai's arrears are only for one month, which does not count as arrears before January 28. These tenants cannot be said to be bad. The arrears of the new rent were caused by the rent waiver dispute and are the landlord's own doing. Furthermore, the Municipal Party Headquarters is still petitioning the Central Government to revise the rent waiver standards, and various rent reduction associations have notified the tenants to postpone rent payment before the standards are officially established. According to these regulations, Wang Xiangtai's arrears do not exceed the limits, but his shop was sealed up, which is unreasonable. Stepping back, it is feared that Wang Xiangtai may be unable to pay the arrears and may flee secretly, so a preliminary attachment was made. However, there is a guarantor to pursue. In summary, the landlord is completely unreasonable. At a time when rumors are rampant and people are uneasy, the businesses in the disaster areas are half-dead and stagnant, and the common people are struggling to make a living. How can they withstand such great oppression? If the government does not impose appropriate sanctions immediately, others will follow suit and evict tenants or ask the court to seal up their shops to satisfy their desire to increase rent. If this continues, the association can say with certainty that there is no hope of recovery, and the Zhabei market will decline and never recover. A strong enemy is invading from the outside, and the landlords are destroying from the inside, forcing the common people to have nowhere to live. Thinking of this, how can we not be filled with emotion? Therefore, we earnestly request that the landlord be severely punished and that the court be ordered to unseal Wang Xiangtai's shop to appease public anger. The rent arrears should be paid according to the old rent, and the new rent should be paid in installments. We also request that all landlords be ordered that, unless the Zhabei houses are actually taken back for their own use, they are only allowed to recover rent arrears and are not allowed to evict tenants at will. In this way, people's hearts will be at peace, and there will be hope for recovery. The above is a direct statement, respectfully requesting your consideration. Lu Youguang, Chairman of the Zhabei Shilu Businessmen's Association."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Tongchunfang Tenants Friendship Association Seeks Assistance <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Tongchunfang Tenants Friendship Association issued a notice to all sectors of society, stating: "On the 28th of January, the shops in Tongchunfang respected the notices of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Businessmen's Association, and others and unanimously went on strike for two months. At that time, under the constant threat of enemy aircraft and bombs exploding everywhere, even the Dongxinqiao in the French Concession near Tongchunfang was bombed, and the newspapers frequently reported the news, creating a tense atmosphere. In this situation, the only option for the shop assistants was to flee, but they needed money to flee. The only option for the goods was to move them, but they also needed money to move them. The business income was equal to zero, and the extra expenses exceeded the usual amount. We have endured the pain and feel deeply troubled. Now, although the market situation has recovered slightly, the pain remains and the vitality has not been restored. However, the landlord of Tongchunfang, the foreign merchant Erde, has ignored the difficulties of the shops and has not only failed to sympathize but has also hired a large number of lawyers to force the eighteen shops in the Tongchunfang to pay all the rent during the strike period. We have filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court and are being strictly pursued. The shops are too poor to do anything but hire a half-time volunteer lawyer, Le Junying, to appear in court. We are outnumbered and the situation is very different. Our only hope is to have a wise judge make a decision based on law and reason. On July 5, the court issued a judgment ordering the tenants to pay the rent for February and March during the strike period and to bear the litigation costs. In addition to the rent, there are also litigation costs. We, the common people, are in dire straits. We have learned that this case involves 2 million taels of rent for all the foreign commercial landlords in Shanghai, which has caused them to exert all their strength to oppress us. While the scope of this case is small for the shops in Tongchunfang, it is large for the citizens of Shanghai. We are determined to persist and strive for a fair resolution on whether or not to waive the rent for February and March during the war period. In addition to hiring Le Junying to file an appeal and seek redress, we respectfully request that all sectors of society, in the spirit of solidarity, rise up and strive for justice. If you can provide spiritual or material assistance, or other accurate legal evidence, data, testimonials, and exhibits that can be used for reference in this case, please let us know in advance so that we can arrange a meeting with you to testify in court. We have also learned that although the Municipal Government has announced the rent waiver standards, if the effect of this biased and unfair local method is not fundamentally overturned, the application of Article 441 of the Civil Code will be difficult. Therefore, the tenants of Tongchunfang, in addition to pursuing an appeal, have also filed an administrative appeal for relief. There are many tenants in Shanghai who are in the same position as the Tongchunfang tenants. We hope that you will take unified action to seek common welfare. Tongchunfang Tenants Friendship Association, September 3, 21st year of the Republic."</p>

<p>Reason for Housing the Body of Zhang Zongchang</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Zongchang, the former Shandong Military Governor, being shot and killed by Zheng Jicheng in revenge, has aroused extreme attention in society. The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai, because of reports that Zhang's body was housed in the Anhui Native Place Ancestral Hall in Jinan, strongly disagreed and sent a letter to the Anhui Native Place Association in Jinan to inquire about the truth. The letter stated: "We are writing to you regarding reports that Zhang Zongchang was shot and killed in Jinan and that his body was housed in the Anhui Native Place Ancestral Hall. We are extremely surprised. Zhang Zongchang's life and the fact that he was killed are now settled. The murderer Zheng Jicheng's confession is frank, moving, and worthy of a hero from Yan and Zhao. Society has paid great attention to it. The Anhui Native Place Ancestral Hall is a solemn place, but it is being used to house Zhang's body. We are writing to your association to inquire about the reasons for borrowing it to express the disagreement of the people of Anhui. If the truth is not clear, public opinion is to be feared. Please investigate and reply. Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai, September 7."</p>

<p>Foreign wines flood the market, mostly from Europe and America. Imports reach 30 to 40 million yuan annually. The outflow is not small. Overseas Chinese Li Xiang and others, in view of this, in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, gathered overseas Chinese merchants to prepare to set up a factory. In the summer of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the factory was established with a registered capital of 150,000 yuan. Because it used the spring water of Huishan Mountain to brew wine, it set up a factory in Wuxi. In the autumn of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, it set up a general distribution office in Shanghai and branches in Guangzhou. However, the initial products were not easy to sell and were squeezed out by imported goods. The business losses were quite large. It then continued to raise new shares of 150,000 yuan from overseas Chinese and moved the factory to Tangshan Road in Shanghai. All matters of the company were reformed, and Dr. Mei Guantao, a chemistry doctor, and European and American winemaking masters were hired to assist in everything. In recent years, the products have become more and more excellent, enough to compete with imported goods, and the price is especially cheap, several times different from the price of imported goods. Recently, with the increasing sales, the supply is in short supply, so the production has been increased. In addition to the original four types of brandy, such as Samsung, Five Star, Blue Seal, and Longevity, three types of port wine, such as Hero, Samsung, and Kai Di, and red wine and white wine, new products have been added, such as Gold Medal and Silver Medal whiskey, which are all praised by people in society. The company's winemaking machine strength can produce about 300 gallons of wine per day. The raw materials used to be 60% to 70% from foreign countries, but now only 20% to 30% are used. The technical progress is truly a rare achievement in domestic products.</p>

<p>Discussing Concrete Measures to Deal with Philippine Government's Tax Increase</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau, because ham, eggs, sausages, lard, and other items in the city are bulk foods sold abroad, and the Philippine government recently increased the tax rate on ham, eggs, and other foods, convened a meeting of relevant exporters at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Representatives of the City Chamber of Commerce, Luo Qinghua, Cai Xiaohe, representing the Ham Industry Association, Ye Jiaxing and Zheng Yuanxing, representing the Sausage Industry Association, and Zhang Pansun, representing the International Trade Bureau, attended the meeting. The concrete countermeasures are as follows: (1) First, assess the amount of Philippine goods imported into China. If the amount of Chinese goods exported to the Philippines is greater, then the strategy will be to increase the import tax on Philippine goods as a countermeasure. (2) The relevant commercial associations will state their countermeasures and send them to the City Chamber of Commerce for reference, and then the City Chamber of Commerce will forward them. (3) Notify the United States, pay attention to Sino-American relations, and persuade the Philippine government not to implement the tax increase. (4) Suggest that the government revise the tariff on Philippine goods in order to counter them.</p>

<p>Due to Sharp Drop in Japanese Exchange Rate</p>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai received a telegram from its home country yesterday stating that Japan's export trade in August was worth 136 million yen. Since the sharp drop in the Japanese exchange rate, exports of raw silk, cotton cloth, and silk have increased greatly. On the contrary, imports of goods, except for cotton and machinery, have decreased. Therefore, the result of foreign trade in this month was a surplus of 63 million yen. However, since the beginning of this year, the total deficit in foreign trade has still reached more than 160 million yen.</p>

<p>Steelworker Blows Off Half of His Right Hand</p>
<p>Wu Xiquan, a 50-year-old man from Pudong, runs a coppersmith shop at No. 81 Zhangjia Lane, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. The day before yesterday, Wu bought several catties of scrap copper from his colleague Zhu Hongsheng, who lives in Zhabei, and brought it back to his shop. However, there was a bomb in the scrap copper. Wu did not notice. Yesterday morning at about 9:00 a.m., Wu was crushing the scrap copper with an iron hammer in order to melt it and turn it into copper utensils. Unexpectedly, there was a loud bang that shook the sky and the earth. Residents nearby heard the sound and were surprised and rushed to the shop to check. They saw Wu in a daze on the ground, and the upper half of his right hand had been blown off by the bomb. The scene was tragic. People took Wu to the hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, the injury was not fatal, but after the injury heals, the right hand will be disabled.</p>

<p>Both Sides Open Fire</p>
<p>The house of Yu Maogeng, the head of the Yujia Sanzhai Tudong in Meilong Town, West Shanghai, was robbed on the morning of the 6th. Zhang Bukui, the patrol chief of the police station in charge, led the police day and night to patrol everywhere to deter the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits dared to gather more than 20 people again one day later, at about 10:00 p.m. last night, to rob the house of Yu Atao, a farmer in the Yujia Old House, 100 steps east of the Yujia Sanzhai, with the intention of robbing. Just as Patrol Chief Zhang was patrolling here, under the moonlight, he saw figures moving about and gathering in groups, so he stepped forward and asked for the password. The bandits pulled out guns and shot at the police. Patrol Chief Zhang also drew his gun and returned fire. For a time, gunshots rang out and bullets flew around. The platoon leader Mei Mingyuan of the Security Regiment's defense post and the security team heard the alarm and rushed to help with the pursuit. After 30 minutes, the bandits were defeated and retreated eastward. Both sides fired more than 30 shots.</p>

<p>Recently, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has spared no effort in rectifying the Pudong ferry business. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter asked Huang Boqiao, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, about this matter. According to him, the city ferry currently has four cross-river ferries: 1. From Dongmen Road to Dongchang Road, 2. From Huishan Wharf to Qichangzhan, 3. From Dinghai Bridge to Qingning Temple, 4. From Wusong to Gaoqiao. The ferry equipment is also more thorough than the past commercial operations. However, improvements are still being sought. It is planned to build new-style double-ended ferries and to use oil for combustion. In addition, there are also four ferries between Tongren Wharf and Gaoqiao, which run once every hour. However, there are more passengers on Sundays or other holidays, so it is crowded. If the machinery is damaged, there is a concern that the service will be suspended. Therefore, it is planned to build another ferry in the near future for use on Sundays, holidays, or when the machinery is damaged. Long-distance ferries are also being planned. The municipal government originally had an organization called the City Business Economic Committee last year, and the rules of the committee have also been announced. The first meeting can be convened approximately next week. At that time, all of the bureau's plans for public business will be submitted for discussion. I was given the rules of the committee, so I have copied them as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e142">Highway near Hui and Ning Road: Robbery, Police and Thieves Exchange Fire <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>No One Injured, Three Thieves Escape</p>
<p>Li Sixuan, a local, has operated the Ding He Tai tobacco and paper store at number 417 Hui Ning Road in the second district of Nanshi for many years. Business was said to be decent. At 7:45 PM last night, three robbers suddenly arrived, each armed with a handgun. Two stood guard at the entrance, while one, holding a gun, broke into the store. He robbed fifty-six yuan in cash and over three hundred jiao in fractional currency from the counter and attempted to flee with the loot. He fired two shots as a warning while exiting. Unexpectedly, the back door of the store connected to Huai Ren Li. A police officer on patrol named Wang Fenglou was stationed inside the lane. Hearing the gunshots, he gave chase from the store's back door. One of the thieves fired two shots at him, but missed. Officer Wang returned fire with two shots, which also missed the thief. Finally, as the police officer pursued relentlessly, the three thieves turned around and fired two more shots. Officer Wang then fired five shots in quick succession. Both sides were extremely flustered, so no one was injured. At that time, Officer Wang knew he only had one bullet left in his gun, so he could not continue the pursuit. The three thieves narrowly escaped. Afterwards, the victim, accompanied by Officer Wang, filed a report to the Second District Headquarters requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Chen Xiangyong Dies from Severe Injuries</p>
<p>A Russian named Bai Xuedeng (transliteration), residing at number 1230, C building, number 1, Xiafei Road in the French Concession, drove his own car, number 1103, on the 5th of this month at 10:40 AM, passing through Lafayette Road from west to east. In front of number 774 on that road, the driver was careless and crashed into the right support of a parked rickshaw on the south side of the sidewalk, injuring Chen Yongxiang, an electrician from Shaoxing, who was standing next to the rickshaw. Unexpectedly, Bai's car did not stop and continued forward, colliding with four small carts traveling west. Three cart pullers, including Zhao Jiurong and Li Malang, were knocked down and seriously injured. Bai's car then crashed into the wall of a certain general association before finally stopping. Patrol officers arrived and sent the injured and the carts to the hospital for treatment. They also brought Bai, along with the car, to the police station. Yesterday, the traffic affairs office sent Bai to the Second Special Court, Second Criminal Division for investigation. The police station's lawyer, Yuan Jiahuan, stated that according to the police station's investigation, the defendant was indeed drunk at the time. This behavior constitutes the crime of negligent injury under Article 301 of the Criminal Code and violates Articles 31 of the Municipal Council's vehicle traffic regulations, which prohibits individuals whose physical condition is not deemed fit to drive or who are intoxicated from driving, and Article 7 of the same regulations, which requires vehicle drivers to control their speed. Violators are subject to a fine of one to one hundred yuan. He requested an investigation. Following this, Yu Xiji, the lawyer representing the victims, requested compensation for damages. The defendant, Bai Xuedeng, stated that he was trying to avoid repairing trenches in the middle of the road when he hit the rickshaw. In addition, the motor in his car malfunctioned, leading to the accident. Judge Wu instructed that another hearing be held after the victims recovered. The defendant was remanded into custody. Chen Xiangyong, who was injured, died from his severe injuries at the Guangci Hospital during the court hearing. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the coroner's office. The same afternoon, Deng, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, was requested to come to the office to examine the body, after which the body was released to the family for funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Approves Proportional Distribution Based on Pawn Ticket Value</p>
<p>Pawning Customers Allowed to Inspect the Inventory at Any Time</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the people's economy has suffered greatly. The pawnshop industry, especially those located in Zhabei, has been robbed extensively, seriously impacting the finances of the poor. Previously, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau received reports of robberies from pawnshops such as Dingsheng on Gonghe Xin Road, Zengshun on Guoqing Road, and Dekang on North Sichuan Road in Zhabei. However, because the Japanese troops had not yet withdrawn at that time, officials were unable to investigate, and the truth remained unclear. To be cautious, the Bureau ordered each pawnshop to submit a signed statement. The statement said, "If the reported robbery situation of the pawnshop is false, we are willing to accept punishment." The Bureau approved the filing and, in accordance with Article 22 of the Shanghai Pawnshop Business Regulations, ordered that pawned items with receipts be redeemed as usual. Remaining unreceipted pawned items should be sold, with half the proceeds going to the pawnshop and half distributed proportionally to the pawning customers based on the value of the pawn tickets. It is said that for Dingsheng Pawnshop, each one yuan of the pawn ticket will get 2 fen for the pawning customer. The Zengshun Pawnshop paid out 4 fen per yuan for the pawning customers. The Dekang Pawnshop paid 3 fen per yuan for the pawning customers. Furthermore, stamped copies of the robbery inventory were issued for pawning customers to inspect and verify at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Closing Arguments in Seven-Year-Old Kidnapping Case <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Qian Guanjin, a local villager residing at number 7, inside the alleyway of number 206, Pu'en Jishe Road in the French Concession, had his seven-year-old son, Miaofu, kidnapped on the evening of July 20th of this year at 6 PM while he was cooling off in the courtyard. The kidnappers forcibly dragged him away and hid him. The kidnappers then sent a letter to the family, demanding 30,000 yuan for his release. The family received ten letters from the kidnappers, urging negotiations. On August 13th, inspectors Jin Jiulin, Western detective Li Yaolong, Zhang Ziying, and Chinese detective Qin Youyu from the special organ of the French police, arrested Wei Youwen, a Jiangbei native involved in the kidnapping case, on Pingjili Road. Wei confessed that the kidnapping was committed by Wang Shaoqing and Xu Dashunzi, who lived on Taopeng Road. The detectives proceeded to arrest Wang and Xu. The hostage was rescued from a small boat in the creek in Fahua Township (end of Haige Road) and escorted home. After investigating the case, the police sent Wei and the other two to the Second Special District Court for prosecution on the charge of kidnapping for ransom. After being interrogated, the court ordered the case to be reviewed at a later date. Details of the case were published in the newspaper on the 30th of last month. Yesterday at 11 AM, Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the criminal division, and Deng Baosun, the prosecutor, convened the hearing at the First Criminal Division. First, they questioned Qian Guanjin, the victim's father, about the kidnapping and the subsequent ransom letters from the kidnappers. The defendants confessed that the kidnapping was organized by Yang Santie, who was still at large. (All confessions were the same as those given in the previous hearing and are not repeated here.) After the questioning, the court ordered the closing arguments to begin. First, Gu Shouxi, the police station's lawyer, argued that the defendants had clearly confessed to the kidnapping and should be severely punished according to the law. The court-appointed lawyer, Wang Shizong, and the temporarily appointed lawyer, Shen Yushan, argued on behalf of the defendants, stating that they were all accessories and requested leniency. Finally, the prosecutor gave his legal opinion, and the court declared the closing arguments concluded. The verdict will be announced at a later date. The defendants were remanded into custody. The court adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Zhujing Kidnappers Approved for Transfer <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Six Months Imprisonment for Illegally Possessing Firearms</p>
<p>Xu Jiakui, Wu Yeming, Zhu Yeyu, Yuan Peicai from Anhui province, previously committed a kidnapping case in the Zhujing Tianran River area of Dexing County, Zhejiang Province. They fled to Shanghai and hid at number 56, Taopeng Road. The local river police team arrested several people. On the 2nd of this month, Wang Chonghao, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, learned that bandits were hiding in the house. He secretly went with a Western detective to the address and arrested Xu and the other three. They found a handgun and four bullets on the roof and took them to the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau had already received an official letter from Dexing County, sending detectives to the case, stating that the defendants had committed a kidnapping case there. When questioned, the defendants denied the charges. The court ordered them to be detained pending official notification from Dexing County, at which point they would be secretly brought up. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, requested that closing arguments be held for the part of the case concerning the illegal possession of firearms and for a verdict to be scheduled. The court approved. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong came to the Fourth Criminal Division. The police station lawyer said that the local river public security team had sent detective Li Lanqing to the case to transfer the defendants. The police station did not object. It was heard that the leader of the kidnapping ring, named Hu Xiaobianzi, had also been arrested. Detective Li presented the official letter, requesting the transfer. Judge Shen sentenced the four defendants, Xu Jiakui and others, to six months in prison for illegally possessing firearms. The number of days of detention prior to the sentence will be counted as two days of detention equaling one day of imprisonment. The firearms and bullets were confiscated. The defendants were handed over to the detectives from the First District of the Jiangsu River Public Security Team to be taken away. After the questioning, they were sent back to the court to be executed.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, many houses in the North Sichuan Road area were destroyed by gunfire. As things gradually settled down, the homeowners began reconstruction. Behind the Odeon Cinema, houses were being demolished yesterday at around 4 PM when a large wall collapsed, injuring four laborers on the spot, all of whom sustained head injuries. They were sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. The names of the injured are as follows: Wu Da, 30 years old; Hu Er, 40 years old; Zhou Minquan, 17 years old; Qu Sanxiao, 16 years old.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Ye Fangyan and Others Impersonate Municipal Council Inspectors, Extorting Money <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Numerous Crimes Committed in the Nanshi Area as Well</p>
<p>Ye Fangyan from Hangzhou, Cheng Fengxiang from Tongzhou, and Li Changyou from Ningbo, from August 11th to the 3rd of this month, impersonated inspectors from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department. They went to the homes of Wu Dongshi, a woman at number 353 Huade Road, Jibosheng at number 378 on the same road, Ru Gaoshi at number 227 Taopeng Road, Liu Jinlong at number 233 on the same road, and Lu Axiao at number 66 Fenzhou Road, telling them that canopies should not be erected on balconies and that too many wooden boards were not allowed in the rooms. They ordered them to be dismantled, threatened them, and extorted more than 20 yuan in total. A few days ago, they did the same in the Yangshupu area. Xie Wanfang, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, arrested Ye and the other two and took them to the police station. They found counterfeit licenses and badges of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Inspection Department, as well as two notebooks and two rulers. The police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the previous situation and said that the investigation revealed that there was an accomplice named Lei Wenkui who was the leader, and who used to make money by fraud in the Nanshi area of the Chinese territory, working together with the defendants Ye and Cheng. Because the profits were not divided equally, they split up, and the third defendant, Li Changyou, joined in their work. The confiscated items were submitted for inspection and requested strict punishment to deter others from following suit. Following this, the victims stated the situation in which the defendants cheated and defrauded them. The three defendants confessed that the presented licenses and badges were given by Lei Wenkui and were unaware that they were counterfeit. Lei is a native of Nanxiang and used to live at number 2, Yongnian Li, Aiduya Road in the French Concession. They were evasive about other confessions and asked for leniency. After Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confessions, he sentenced Ye Fangyan to one year and six months of imprisonment and Cheng Fengxiang and Li Changyou each to one year of imprisonment. The confiscated evidence was confiscated. Lawyer Zhang from the police station stood up again and said that the defendants had also committed similar crimes in Nanshi and that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau wanted to transfer them for investigation but had not sent anyone to court. He asked for instructions. Judge Shen approved the transfer of the three defendants Ye and others to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation and interrogation, but they would still be sent back to this court for execution.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Song Tianxiang Sues Wife for Compensation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Song Tianxiang, son of Song Wugang, a female doctor from the old Song family in Ningbo, married Tu Fumei from Ningbo the year before last. Song suspected his wife of infidelity, leading to discord. Recently, Tu Fumei petitioned the court for divorce, but mediation failed. Song Tianxiang also hired lawyer Tang Hangjian to submit a petition to the court requesting compensation for losses. The petition reads as follows: "For absconding and refusing to return, using the excuse of divorce and requesting compensation for losses. This petitioner married the defendant as a second wife on October 13th of the 19th year of the Republic of China through matchmaker Shen Lianxiang. The wedding was held in Ningbo, and we returned to our residence in Shanghai three days later. In less than half a month, she would seize every opportunity to go out and return home late at night, which she considered normal. This petitioner tried to persuade her with kind words, but the defendant turned a deaf ear. Sometimes, if there were any disputes, the defendant would become enraged and gather many people to beat and injure this petitioner. Later, after persuasion from relatives and friends, the matter was settled. The defendant admitted her mistakes and repented, so this petitioner also hoped to settle the matter and make peace, hoping that the couple would return to harmony. Unexpectedly, the defendant suddenly ran away on her own on April 11th of last year, taking with her soft luggage, clothes, jewelry, and other items, estimated to be worth over 1,500 yuan. This petitioner reported this to the police station at the time, and there is a record. This petitioner repeatedly inquired and finally learned that the defendant had fled back to Ningbo. He repeatedly sent people to urge her to return home, but she ignored them. It was not until June 25th that this petitioner received a letter from the defendant's cousin, Tu Shaohong, stating that the defendant refused to return to Shanghai and wanted a divorce. This petitioner then hired a lawyer to send a letter of inquiry and persuasion, but the defendant still ignored it. It was not until July 23rd of this year that Tu Shaowen and others were persuaded to persuade Zhao Anlan to propose a divorce to this petitioner, willing to return the gold jewelry and other items taken away that year. This petitioner thought that ordinary middle-class families spend their hard-earned savings over the years to marry a wife and start a family, which is not easy. When marrying the defendant, all the expenses for the wedding and goods cost about 4,000 yuan. Once divorced, it would be like the family being destroyed. If he remarries, he does not know when to wait, would it not be both a loss of people and money? After thinking it over again and again, how could he be willing? Therefore, this petitioner petitions the court to summon the defendant to the court and order her to compensate for the expenses before and after the wedding and the clothes and other items taken away, totaling 4,080 yuan, to protect his rights and maintain humanity. It would be virtuous and convenient." The court granted the petition and a hearing will be held soon.</p>

<p>Deceased's Father Has Only One Son</p>
<p>Requests the Court to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Huang Zixi, 23 years old, a native of Pudong, was fatally injured by his friend Chen Yun (also known as Ke Ming), 33 years old, a native of Shaoxing, with a kitchen knife on the head, hands, and other parts inside number 7, Ganxin Fang, Huade Road. The incident was discovered by Chinese Deputy Head Constable Feng Ruisheng and Yan Haiqing, the watchman of the alley, who arrested the assailant on the spot and sent the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The body was sent by the Huishan Police Station to the autopsy office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, Zhang Yan, a forensic doctor, Wang Zuyi, a clerk, and others came to the office to examine the body. Seated in public, they interrogated the assailant Chen Keming, who claimed, "I have known the deceased for nearly four years, and we were on very good terms. Recently, I discovered that he was having an affair with my wife. Because of this, I was stimulated and became mentally disturbed, so I injured him to death on that day. I had no economic dealings with him." Huang Jintang, the deceased's father, stated, "I am 50 years old. The deceased is my son. He was friends with Chen Keming. My son was a bookkeeper at the Huayang Beef Shop on Xiafei Road. Chen used to sell peaches and had dealings with the shop, so they became acquainted. I only have this one son. Now that this unfortunate event has occurred, I request the court to uphold justice." After obtaining the confession, Guo issued an order stating that Huang Zixi died as a result of being cut by a knife on his head, hands, and other parts. The assailant Chen Keming has been prosecuted by the police station and should be sent to the court along with a kitchen knife for review. The body was handed over to the deceased's father, Huang Jintang, who signed a statement to take it back for funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Investigation into Stolen Components of Fire Hydrants <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai South District Firefighting Association oversees the installation of hundreds of fire hydrants in the streets and alleys and roads within the four districts of the southeast, northwest, and north. These hydrants are specifically designed to facilitate firefighting in the event of a fire. In recent years, the iron covers of the water tanks on all fire hydrants have been frequently stolen by thieves, and this has become increasingly outrageous. The copper screws on the fire hydrant openings have also been chiseled off and stolen, affecting more than 30 locations. The copper screws are the most critical components for connecting the leather hoses during firefighting. Once stolen, the hydrant becomes unusable, causing significant harm to the local area. The Firefighting Association has petitioned the Public Security Bureau to order its subordinate district offices to investigate and punish the perpetrators. In addition, local residents near the installed fire hydrants are advised to pay extra attention. Anyone who witnesses the theft of copper screws or water tank iron covers from the fire hydrant openings, regardless of who they are, is permitted to hand them over to the police on duty for investigation, so as to eliminate local hazards and protect the public safety of the people.</p>

<p>The preparations for the Shanghai Nanhua Industry Trade Union have been underway for several months. A preparatory committee was launched and submitted to the Municipal Party Committee for filing. However, due to a lack of responsible personnel and disorganization, members reported the situation to the Municipal Party Committee, which ordered a re-election and an increase in the number of preparatory committee members. The union convened a general meeting under the supervision of the Municipal Party Committee and elected 18 people. The Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee has now approved the designation of Yu Yaoqiu, Huang Jiabang, Cheng Faling, Cai Jiugao, Ling Baode, Hu Xiaoxiang, Mei Lanqing, Fan Xinsheng, Wu Changgen, and nine others as the preparatory committee for the Nanhua Industry Trade Union. The registration has now begun at the Yaohuang Temple in Qiaojia浜, with a two-week deadline. The inaugural meeting is scheduled for September 20th.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Recent News on the Photographic Printing of the Song Dynasty Qishazang Buddhist Canon <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The translation and circulation of Buddhist scriptures in China initially relied on handwritten copies, then stone carvings, and then wood carvings. Printing became more convenient and circulation became more widespread. This was particularly prevalent during the Song dynasty, such as the Shu edition of the Northern Song dynasty, the Dongchan Temple edition of Fuzhou, the Kaiyuan Temple edition of Fuzhou in the Southern Song dynasty, the Wang Yongcong edition of Sixi, the Zifu Temple edition of Sixi, and the Yansheng Monastery edition of Qisha, all of which were famous among the versions. However, today, if one wants to see its remnants, the Shu edition is as rare as a phoenix, and even the other five editions from Dongchan onwards are either found in domestic and foreign collections or have been recorded in books as a small number of fragments without a large part, or later generations have supplemented the editions instead of the original edition. Now, the Qishazang Buddhist Canon, which is photographed and printed in Shanghai, is a complete set and the original edition. The photographs capture the original stones, and the authenticity is preserved, which greatly satisfies the wishes of researchers and practitioners around the world. The origin of the Qishazang Collection: During the Duanping period of the Song dynasty (1234 AD), the Buddhist nun Hongyuan of the Yansheng Monastery in Qisha, Pingjiang, cut off her arm and raised funds to publish the entire collection of sutras, precepts, and treatises. It was not completed until the Zhida period of Emperor Wuzong of the Yuan dynasty. This is a rough overview. The original version is in the form of palm leaves. The collection of the Wolong and Kaiyuan Temples in Xi'an is now preserved by the Shaanxi Provincial Library. Last year, Mr. Zhu Qinglan discovered it during disaster relief and assigned Fan Cheng to investigate it in detail. Each page has five sides, each side has six lines, and each line has seventeen characters. It has the nianhao of Jiaxi (1237 AD) and Chunyou (1241 AD). Ye Gongchuo, Jiang Weiqiao, Di Baoxian, Xu Naichang, Ding Fubao, Huang Yichang, Wu Zhaozeng, Li Jingwei, Li Yuanjing, and others all believed that this was the most perfect complete collection of ancient Chinese editions, which fortunately survived for 600 years. It must contribute greatly to the world's culture and art. It was then decided to photograph, print, and distribute it, and the Shanghai Photographic Printing Song Edition Tibetan Sutra Society was organized in Shanghai (the office is located on the fourth floor of Bao'an Fang, Damalu, Shanghai Public Concession) to be responsible for handling it. The Buddhist Bookstore (located in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, Shanghai Public Concession) is responsible for all distribution matters. The work of compiling and proofreading the scriptures, collecting missing leaves, and ordering printing paper has made considerable progress. Previously, photography technicians and editorial staff were selected and sent to Shaanxi, where Li Shouting and Fan Cheng supervised the photography of glass slides, which is actively underway. It is expected to print 500 copies, each with more than 6,300 volumes, which will be published in stages and completed in three years. The advance purchase price is 525 yuan, paid in full at one time. A notice will be published in the newspaper soon. The reporter has seen the original scriptures, with elegant characters, exquisite engraving, few errors, and the ability to correct errors in later editions. The images of Buddhas listed at the beginning of the volumes are especially solemn and beautiful. The writers and engravers of the day wrote their wishes and signed their names, containing merit, which is different from the simplicity of other books. Studying and reciting it will sweep away secular obstacles. Libraries, academic organizations, and temples are expected to rush to order it.</p>

<p>Words of Old Man Ma Xiangbo, Ninety-Three Years Old</p>
<h3 id="e172">Glimpses of the Ten Commandments <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang advocated using the Ten Commandments, not starting from the time of national crisis: On the National Humiliation Memorial Day, May 7, 1916, he also lectured in the Central Park of Beijing. Now, a few excerpts are selected to show a glimpse of the content.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the Sixth Commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery": that is, the most difficult marriage problem to solve now. "Marriage as husband and wife is a lifelong agreement to grow old together. If they abandon each other halfway, they are directly committing a great sin of disloyalty, dishonesty, unkindness, and injustice to humanity. Therefore, if adultery is committed, it is only right to separate and sleep in different rooms."</p>
<p>"Our country also knows that men and women living together is the greatest human relationship. How can the greatest relationship be changed every morning and evening? It is also known that if there is no distinction between husband and wife, it is close to being beasts; however, women who are suitable for sons borrow from friends and it is passed on as a good story! Everyone says: All evils start with lust; as for watching lewd plays and reading lewd books, they think of it as a pastime. Who knows that new scholars are opening up a new situation, saying that human beings are originally beasts, why bother to adhere to etiquette: isn't this the brand new situation in our country?"</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, in your opinion, should it be maintained or not?"</p>
<p>"As recorded in history books and reported in newspapers, both in ancient times and now, it is always the same. It can be seen that a woman would rather be killed than be raped; then, to rape one more woman is tantamount to killing one more person. Some people euphemistically call it 'taking a concubine'. Where is the affection? It is only for your stinky skin and stinky lust! If you say that you are doting on your concubine, you are actually taking away her freedom, destroying her personality, losing her shame, and extinguishing her spiritual light. You say I bought it with money, is it possible that people are for sale?"</p>
<p>"The Gospel of Matthew says: Whoever entices young children, it would be better to take a millstone and hang it around his neck and sink him to the bottom of the sea! It is as if to say that the evil of that person should not be allowed to live on the earth!"</p>

<p>Various Aspects丨</p>
<p>In the dazzling organs and public offices, high-ranking officials with broad minds and fat bodies come in and out, as do arrogant section chiefs and haggard and dejected junior staff. The high-ranking officials seem not to care about coming and going; the middle-ranking ones are spirited and lively; and the junior staff are worried and hurried.</p>

<p>In the sky, airplanes, the means of transportation of the twentieth century, come and go; on Zhongshan Road, bright and fast cars speed by. On the muddy stone roads, dilapidated horse-drawn carts bump along; perhaps the wheelbarrow, which was invented before the era, squeaks and moves like a mournful cry.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>The newly built official residences are all palace-style, resplendent and magnificent. But the entire layout and furnishings inside are completely Western, beautiful and comfortable. This is called "two difficulties are combined, and four beauties are combined." I remember Premier Sun Yat-sen saying that "the national revolution is the integration of China and the West"; the Three Principles of the People also draw extensively from ancient Chinese thought and follow modern Western modernism. Even architecture, a minor detail, is the same.</p>

<p>The thatched huts contrast each other; the long and clean Zhongshan Road contrasts with the roads that are "incense burners on sunny days and soy sauce vats on rainy days". But alas, the asphalt on both sides of Zhongshan Road is long gone, the mud and sand have been exposed, and it is also aging.</p>

<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>Old Brands Few丨Fake Brands Many丨</p>
<p>The so-called Shanghai people are not actually Shanghai people. Real Shanghai people are called locals. Although there are no accurate statistics on the number of locals in Shanghai, according to ordinary estimates, they probably account for no more than 10%. The remaining 90%, although they include Cantonese, Ningbo people, Shandong people, Jiangbei people, and people from other remote border provinces, they all claim to be Shanghai people. So if you meet a guest who cannot speak a sentence of Shanghai dialect, just compliment him as a "Shanghai person", and you will never be wrong. Because of the mixture of people from all directions, "Shanghai dialect" is also greatly affected by "Shanghai people". The Shanghai dialect spoken by "locals" is actually authentic "Shanghai dialect", but "Shanghai people" insist that what the locals speak is Pudong dialect. The "Shanghai dialect" is a patchwork of dialects from various places. For example, "I" must be said like Ningbo people say "Ala"; "You" must be said like the locals say "侬"; "He" must be said like Suzhou people say "俚"; "Good" must be said like Cantonese say "顶括括"; "Bad" must be said like Northerners say "不兴": To express surprise and disappointment, one must say like Jiangbei people, "乖乖不得了". If your words can learn a sentence from the east and a sentence from the west like this, then people will be sincerely convinced and admire you as a genuine "Old Shanghai".</p>
<p>In the minds of "Shanghai people", it seems that Shanghai people are another ethnic group. Anyone who cannot speak this mixed-up "Shanghai dialect" is collectively called "乡下人", and the synonym for 乡下人 is called "阿木林" for the upper class and "屈死" for the lower class. In fact, today's "Shanghai" cannot even find a piece of brick, and today's concessions are the "countryside" of the former Shanghai. The current self-proclaimed old Shanghai people are actually authentic villagers. The villagers spoken of by Shanghai people may be new people from the city center.</p>

<p>Way Out Money Fight for Profit丨</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In such a depressed society, it is simply impossible to talk about anything! Discussing the various problems of young people, such as seeking education, marriage, finding a career, and others, it takes a lot of effort to get a relatively satisfactory solution, but there is still no certainty, and failures are more common than successes! The depression of society can indeed affect one's outlook on life; those without knowledge certainly feel pain, but those with knowledge feel even more pain. Therefore, at present, there is only this way, that is, to try hard every day, no matter how difficult the problem is, and no matter how depressed the society is. In this way, maybe we can find a way out!</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Seeking education requires money, marriage also requires money, and finding a career certainly requires money! Everything, everything, requires money, and it is impossible without money. In a society under this economic system, the power of money is higher than everything else, which is of course 丨The difference between "poverty-stricken walls" and "golden house hiding beauty" is only the amount of money! This can symbolically represent the present society as a whole. Therefore, those with money will have all their wishes fulfilled, and those without money will be told not to speak! Therefore, I advise you, for the way of money, you should explore it. It is much cheaper to have money after all.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Although society is depressed, the gentlemen and ladies who study "economics" are competing to be the first and the last, from the head of state to the common people, all are enthusiastically engaged in it. This kind of spirit is originally a good phenomenon, but the old master Mencius once said, "If superiors and inferiors compete for profit, the country is in danger!" As usual, it should be said that people who are enthusiastic about "economics" today should "retreat three times", but the fact is not so. Seeing profit bravely, the superiors follow the example of the inferiors, and they are still competing to be the first: as for the safety of the country, it seems to be another problem! Well, what is this phenomenon of national subjugation and species extinction?</p>

<p>Mr. Wang, please take care of my house, I'll go out and buy some things and come back. Fenruo said.</p>
<p>"What are you buying? Today is the memorial monument unveiling ceremony, and all the shops on the street are closed for half a day." Mr. Wang said.</p>
<p>"He loves to eat melon. Eating melon makes him feel cooler, maybe it will make his illness better, that's his habit; and I also want to find Dr. Tang to give him an injection, I haven't been feeling very well these days either, if he's crazy for a few days, I can't stand it."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Dr. Zhang is not at home? Everyone in town has gone to participate in this unveiling ceremony. But if you want melon, you definitely won't be able to buy it. I have two very big snow-fleshed watermelons left at home. Let me go back and bring them to him to eat."</p>
<p>"Okay, thank you! But, I should pay you for the melon."</p>
<p>"We've known each other for so many days, don't we even have the friendship of two watermelons? Sister-in-law! You're too serious." Mr. Wang said, putting on his long gown and leaving.</p>
<p>Less than ten minutes later, Fenruo was upstairs helping Yuan the madman finish his urination when someone knocked on the door downstairs.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang! Why are you running so fast?" Fenruo welcomed Mr. Wang as she opened the door.</p>
<p>"Ah! Is it you?" Fenruo never expected a distinguished guest to arrive, and couldn't guess that he, whom she hadn't seen for more than ten years, had become a national hero worshiped by the whole country. Was she having an illusion, or was she dreaming? After she opened the door, she suddenly saw a military officer walking in very kindly.</p>
<p>"Fenruo, my Fenruo, it's still me, you certainly haven't completely forgotten your old friend. But, I've come too strangely today, it's certainly beyond your expectations." Regiment Commander Yuan closed the door and walked into the hall, and Fenruo followed him in.</p>
<p>"Then please sit down, Regiment Commander Yuan!" Fenruo poured him a cup of tea.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have forgotten my name, Fenruo!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Yuan Renkai! I have already read your great name in the newspapers. How dare I call you by your name, such a hero as you are."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have forgotten my old name, my Fenruo!"</p>
<p>"Please allow me to call you Mr. Yuan Renkai; otherwise I will call you Regiment Commander Yuan! Why bother to spend more brainpower thinking about things from more than ten years ago. Today in this town, a monument is being built for your achievements, waiting for you to perform the unveiling ceremony, why haven't you gone yet, everyone is waiting for you." Fenruo urged Regiment Commander Yuan to leave in a very solemn tone.</p>
<p>"Don't you let me sit for a while longer for such a rare opportunity?"</p>
<p>"Alas! Your future is bright, and it's not appropriate to sit in a widow's house for too long; I'm afraid that if news reporters find out and record it, it will be a whole page again. You should take care of yourself! Although I am also old, and my temples are gray."</p>

<p>Lower at first, then higher: Yesterday, the gold standard fluctuated around 700 taels. There were more than seven taels of fluctuations throughout the day. Overall, it continued to rise by more than four taels. People's confidence turned from weak to strong. It opened slightly lower, and Guangbang (Cantonese merchants) continued to buy. Moreover, the Central Bank continued to absorb spot goods, and the price of gold rose. Later, news from foreign telegraphs reported that war debts would be forgiven, and the market suffered a slight setback. Afterwards, rumors suddenly spread that the international economic conference would be postponed, and the buying mood was vigorous, and the price soared by five or six taels. The exchange rates of British and American currencies were also quite favorable. Traders actively settled their accounts. Finally, it was calculated to be about 707 taels. It is found that the Central Bank bought more than 300 bars of spot goods at a price of 703 taels and a half to two taels and two and a half qian, which were sold by Taikangrun and others. Today, the price of large bars of silver is likely to fall again. The situation of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Early opening low: As soon as the October contract opened in the morning, it fell by one tael and nine qian, to 700 taels and five qian. The next price was 699 taels and eight qian. Then, due to purchases by Tongtaichang, it immediately rose by more than one tael. When Bingxing, Yuanxing, Yong and others came to sell, it immediately retreated to the 700 tael mark.

<p>The cotton yarn market is showing a firm trend again, but actual demand is low, and sentiment is flat. Most small investors still tend to sell off, but Rongxing Hong remains calm. There is no significant development in spot yarn business, so morale is low, and the situation is very scattered. The inventory of local yarn is very low, and buyers' minds are relatively calm.</p>

<p>The cotton market experienced a morning decline and an afternoon rise. In general, sellers, considering the favorable domestic weather and excellent new cotton crop, with news of new cotton arrivals from various places, a certain manufacturer continued to actively sell short, putting significant pressure. However, a certain foreign firm secretly purchased a considerable amount of Chinese cotton at relatively high prices. Based on the global cotton market situation, local cotton is expected to trend higher. Currently, with the surge of new cotton, sellers are putting heavy pressure on the market, resulting in a fluctuating situation.</p>

<p>Sharp Fall of 6-7 Jiao in New Ocean Point Rice</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, more than ten sources came from the west road. Transactions in urban and rural areas were sluggish. As the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, both firms are preparing to close their accounts. The New Ocean Point rice had no demand in this street, falling by 6-7 jiao. Changxi Bijing and Su Tong rice had no increase or decrease. Early and late rice in New Jing fell by nearly a jiao at the opening. The market lacked goods, with no market for changing yuan rice.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: A total of 22-23 boats arrived from various groups. The opening in the morning was tight at first and then fell. The price of Kunshan Jiangyin rice fell by 3 jiao. Chang Su Chen broken top was set. The midstream of Zhongguan, early and late rice were sold as they arrived, and the situation continued to be firm. New ocean point and new japonica were each short by 2 jiao.</p>

<p>Difficult to Calculate Prices After Production Area Reports Increase</p>
<p>Ocean Rice Suddenly Has Outflow to Jiangbei</p>
<p>Yesterday the Hunan rice market was very soft. As cargo owners are squeezed by ocean rice and heard that new Xian rice from Jiangbei and Anning will come to Shanghai soon, they were very soft and intended to sell quickly. The price dropped by a small 2 jiao. 500 bags of Hunan rice were sent to Shantou, with the price only at 7 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen. However, the market price in the production area reported an increase, and the calculated price was even more distant. The source of goods will inevitably be light in the future. The inventory in Shanghai is not abundant, and there may be hope for a turnaround, but with a large amount of ocean rice in existence, it will be difficult for the market to stand firm in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday the outflow of ocean rice was slightly better, but due to the trend of the times, the price also fell by a small 7-8 fen. A total of 1,500 bags of Saigon small squeezed rice and 300 bags of Siam rice were opened. 1,000 bags of Saigon rice were sent to Jiangbei, and the rest were purchased by the two gangs in the mainland. Although the market was weak, the market was lively.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, showed an initial flat and then stable trend. As the price of foreign wheat reported another small drop of 1-2.3 jiao, although the initial market sentiment was flat and weak, the large factories did not show interest, and the small factories did not move, the market gradually rebounded. However, transactions were rare, and it only tended to fluctuate. After the opening in the afternoon, as the Nanyang gang had some futures transactions, although not many, the market sentiment slightly improved. As the Tianjin gang had some spot transactions, the asking price for each month was better. As a result, the prices for September and October were 7.5 li better than the previous day, November was 1 fen better, and December was 5 li. The prices for January and February were 7.5 li better.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, generally trended flat and downwards. Factories with real demand tended to wait and see, and there were no transactions. In addition, the price of ocean wheat repeatedly fell by 1-2.3 jiao, which did not affect the hoarding and non-selling of American wheat. Therefore, the market sentiment was flat, and the asking prices unanimously fell by 2-3 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trading volume for each month was extremely quiet. Most of the trading was short selling. Only September and December had some transactions, and the rest did not open. After observation, the subsequent trend is still expected to fluctuate. As a result, September was down 1 fen, October was down 2 fen, November was down 3 fen, December was down 3 fen, and February was up 1 fen. The spot wheat market was generally stable. The price of Shaoxing wheat was 3 liang 4 qian 2 fen, and the price of Zhenjiang wheat was 3 liang 3 qian, a total of 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market in this port continued to be smooth. European and American companies still have a smooth appetite for white silk warp. Yesterday, Xin Fuda Chang and others imported 50 bales of A-grade 13-15 filament Shanghai white factory warp at a price of 750 taels. Shang Shen imported 60 bales of B-grade 13-15 filament Shanghai white factory warp at a price of 700 taels. Hangzhou silk factory imported 30 bales of mid-body B-grade 13-22 filament Shanghai white factory warp at a price of 645 taels.

<p>The improved varieties cultivated by farmers in the east and west townships of Xiaoshan this year have achieved good results due to the guidance of instructors. New cocoons have been put on the market, and cocoon lines have already been weighed. Unfortunately, the arrival of goods on the market is not prosperous, but the quality of the cocoons is excellent, and the price of cocoons is expected to rise. The highest price has been opened at 48-49 yuan, and the next is 40 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the needle embroidery and show embroidery green tea from both the road and the local companies, Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Yihuo and other firms reopened, and the market situation became active. However, the selling price was 4-5 taels lower. There were also sporadic transactions in Zhenmei and Gongxi items, but recently tea houses and dealers have been asking for tight prices, and the market has been trending downwards. The overall trend of the tea market is still difficult to be optimistic.</p>

<p>Taigu Sugar Market is Expected to Tighten</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trend was stabilized by the slight increase in the Dutch exchange rate and the recovery of the gold standard in the afternoon. The price of high-quality 24th grade raw sugar was still called at 14 taels 5 qian, and the price of ordinary sugar was 14 taels 4 qian. There were many outgoing orders, and there was no sign of excessive tightness. Taigu vehicle sugar opened 2,000 bags yesterday (new tax to be added separately), which will be loaded on the same day. B mark was 7 taels 3 qian, CW mark was 6 taels 9 qian 5 fen, DY mark was 6 taels 8 qian, HX mark was 6 taels 4 qian, and HM mark was 6 taels 1 qian, all at net prices. Later, various firms wanted to open again, but Taigu did not agree, so the market will inevitably increase the price later. The current market price of B is 16 taels 1 qian, CW is 15 taels 6 qian, DY is 15 taels 4 qian, HX is 15 taels, and HM is 14 taels 6 qian. The opening price is still considered cost-effective.

The opening price of the number plate Brother Baibing was dozens of boxes, with each price at 9 taels 7 qian, which is 2 qian higher than before. Taiyuan Bingyuan Pan had a slight opening, and the market must be increased by 2 qian. Wu Xiang Bing is still tightly holding on, and the market is firm and there is no sign of loosening. Binghua Qing opened 50 bags of Zhenxing No. 3 goods yesterday, with the price at 10 taels 5 qian. The original Hong Kong Binghua Qing had continued to arrive yesterday, and the goods were quite good, asking for 12 taels 34 qian, but the deal has not yet been made.</p>

<p>Lily flowers are now in the clear autumn and crisp air, and the incoming goods are gradually drying, making them durable for storage, so the buying intentions of various firms are slightly stronger, and the number holders are also holding tightly. Therefore, the high-priced goods in the previous market once opened to 1 tael. The prices for ordinary goods showed a slight decline the day before yesterday, and the opening price in yesterday's market was tighter. The opening price for the show was around 13 taels. It was found that the market inventory was not sufficient, and the top-ranked Zhuang Cai was sold at 14 taels and a half, followed by 13 taels 56 qian to 13 taels, and the old and secondary dishes were 6 taels 8 qian. The sales are mainly in Fujian and Guangdong, and the market is expected to be tight.</p>

<p>Yesterday, all kinds of woolen fabrics were extremely active, and the market sales were extremely prosperous. The mainland Help followed each other to Shanghai to procure them. Serge, Zhigong呢, Huadani, Chocolate Ding, Western-style fancy呢, and camel hair velvet, etc., all had considerable transactions. Those who went to foreign firms to issue warehouse receipts for delivery were quite crowded.

<p>Metal trading has recently lacked development momentum. Although customers, factories, and construction gangs have all made purchases, the number of transactions is mostly sporadic. Therefore, on the surface, it is quite lively, but Faxi nails, flat white iron, British rigid plates, and tinplate, which were once popular, are still less active. The main market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>There is no shortage of Huisi iron spot goods: It was heard the day before yesterday that the Changzhan warehouse has loaded 6-700 boxes of Fengyu brand Huisi iron, which has been in short supply for many days. The peers who generally purchase this cargo are all eagerly rushing to hear this news. It is said that more than 200 boxes were opened yesterday, with the price at 22 taels 5 qian per box. According to the thoughts of the peers who generally hold this cargo, the cost of this cargo is high, and it is feared that the market situation will have to rise again.</p>
<p>Not a Small Amount of Hankou Wool Tin Arrives in Shanghai: Since the soaring price of tin in this port, the peers have been greatly searching for spot tin in Shanghai. Therefore, the standard has been raised, and it almost has the trend of the spring market. Xiao is 94-5 taels, and the Netherlands is more than 100 taels, which is almost 20 taels higher than before the rise. Therefore, the peers have been wiring to the area of Changkou and Hankou to purchase tin. Therefore, 4-500 bars of wool tin were loaded from Hankou the day before yesterday, with the highest price at 93-4 taels and the lowest at 81-2 taels. It is said that the Shanghai peers have all sold this cargo, and the market situation is around 95-6 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday's coal market still had no progress, and the transactions of various goods were very small. In recent days, the coal market in the east has been very active. Datong, Jingxing, Yuesheng and other coal have few large transactions. The daily batch disassembly of peers is only 20-30 tons. Even Kaiping Boshan and other goods have reduced transactions, but the price of Kuai is stable. Datong Tong is 12 taels, Jingxing Tong is 10 taels 02 qian and a half, Yuesheng Tong is 9 taels 2 qian and a half, and Boshan Tong is 9 taels 7 qian and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Was Zheng Jicheng Guilty? <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The death penalty for murderers is originally a most fair principle in criminal law. There is no disagreement about it in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. However, why was the murder committed? Why was one killed? There are reasons for it. They should be distinguished. We must examine the reasons and study the facts without rashly concluding that the murderer must die,</p>
<p>This time, Zhang Zongchang was assassinated by Zheng Jicheng at Jinan Station, so Zheng seemed to have deserved his crime. However, when Zhang Zongchang was in Shandong, his crimes against Shandong were obvious and well-known. The national government's arrest warrant has not been cancelled to this day. When the Shandong Provincial Government was in Tai'an, it also offered a reward of 50,000 yuan for his arrest. Zhang Zongchang originally deserved his crime to the Republic of China. Therefore, Zheng's killing of Zhang was actually eliminating harm for the country. He is not only innocent, but also deserves a reward. Therefore, Zheng should not have died. First.</p>
<p>Also, Zheng Jicheng confessed that if Zhang Zongchang had killed his uncle on the battlefield, that would be each for his master, and there would be nothing to say. However, Zhang ordered Jiang Mingyu to lure his uncle to Jinan, and after the brutal killing, he offered a reward of 30,000 yuan to go to Tianjin to capture him. He escaped twice by climbing over the wall. Zhang Zongchang not only killed his uncle Zheng Jinsheng, but also wanted to kill Zheng Jicheng to be rid of him quickly. Therefore, Zheng's assassination of Zhang was actually self-defense. If Zheng did not kill Zhang, Zhang would kill Zheng. What crime is there in self-defense? This is Zheng's second reason for not deserving to die.</p>
<p>National legislation exhausts reason to determine rewards and punishments, and uses facts to correct praise and criticism. It cannot use rigid articles and apply them to ever-changing facts. Therefore, what should be studied now is whether Zhang Zongchang is guilty. If Zhang Zongchang is indeed guilty, then Zheng's killing of Zhang should be considered legitimate, and cannot be considered an ordinary murder. If Zhang Zongchang is not guilty, then Zheng's killing of Zhang is naturally illegal. A murderer must die and cannot escape the law.</p>

<p>— Rui · Yu · Cheng ·</p>
<p>Printing is a form of partial dyeing, where desired patterns are made to appear on fabrics. It involves either creating patterns on undyed cloth or removing dye from specific areas of dyed cloth to reveal white patterns. But how is printing done? The key aspects are outlined below:</p>
<p>(A) Classified by Dye Properties:</p>
<p>(1) Mixing dye with an adhesive paste, so that the pattern adheres to the cloth. However, some dyes have a direct affinity for fibers, so they can be printed directly.</p>
<p>(2) Similarly, applying mordant dyes to fabrics that have been treated with a mordant.</p>
<p>(3) Applying dyes that develop color through post-treatment to the fabric, then passing it through a processing bath to develop the color.</p>
<p>(4) Dyeing the fabric first, either with a mordant or a preparatory treatment, then printing with chemicals to remove color from specific areas, or printing with non-coloring agents, followed by a treatment to develop color.</p>
<p>(5) Printing in a way that prevents certain areas from absorbing pigment, then passing it through a dye solution or mordant solution to develop the color.</p>
<p>(B) Classified by Mechanical Equipment:</p>
<p>(1) Printing with engraved rollers.</p>
<p>(2) Printing with engraved blocks.</p>
<p>Both of the above can be either raised or recessed.</p>
<p>(3) Block Pressing: Clamping the fabric between two engraved blocks, firmly securing it to prevent dye from penetrating.</p>
<p>(4) Tie-dyeing: Binding the fabric tightly at the patterned areas to prevent dye from penetrating.</p>
<p>(5) Cutting a paper stencil, then brushing dye paste onto the fabric; or using a stencil to prevent dye paste from being brushed on, before immersing it in dye solution. Or, on dyed fabrics, using a stencil to print with discharge paste and then processing it.</p>
<p>(6) Hand-painting to create the design.</p>
<p>Beyond these classifications, if classified by dyeing and printing processes, there are several other methods, generally distinguished by the color development method:</p>
<p>(1) Pigment Style: These pigments are not dyes that dissolve in water for immersion dyeing. Instead, they are painting pigments (Lake) mixed with a paste and printed onto the fabric surface. This method was mainly used for foreign label cloth in the past.</p>
<p>(2) Direct Printing Style: Using dyes that have a direct affinity for fibers, mixed into a suitable paste for printing. This method is applied to various fabrics.</p>
<p>(3) Steam Style: When applying mordant dyes for printing, the mordant and dye are mixed and printed, then steamed, allowing the two to combine and adhere to the fabric. This method can also be applied to various fabrics. When used with basic dyes, tannic acid must be added for fixation. If antimony salts are also used, it becomes even more durable. This method is exhaustively applied to plant fibers.</p>
<p>Antiques for Sale   Opium Public Sale  Paper Money Tax</p>
<p>Main: Similarly, printing with developing dyes, then passing them through a diazotization solution to develop color, also falls into this category.</p>
<p>(4) Madder or Dyed Style: Printing with a specific mordant, then immersing in a mordant dye to develop the color in that area.</p>
<p>(5) Resist Style: Printing with substances that resist coloration or prevent color development, then immersing or brushing with dye. After removing or washing off the resist, the areas appear white or undyed.</p>
<p>For example, applying a resist paste to fabric mordanted with beta-naphthol, to achieve a resist effect during color development, is called Resist Pad Style. It is used in printing mousseline.</p>
<p>(6) Discharge Style: This method is very important; dyed fabric is printed with color-removing or fading chemicals, revealing a white background or discharging other colors. This method is widely used on various fibers.</p>
<p>With recent advances in chemistry, in addition to the above, new dyeing methods are constantly being invented, creating unique patterns to satisfy people's desires. It is said that there are now methods that combine with the fabric's structure to produce exceptionally beautiful patterns. The civilization of material things is boundless!</p>

<h3 id="e204">A Discussion on the Dining Problem <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Chou</p>
<p>Regarding the Improvement of the Dining Problem.  Mr. Wen Jun of the Yi Yi Restaurant, and Messrs. Qi Xing and Zheng, have successively published many good suggestions in this journal. Now, based on the principles of economy and hygiene, I would like to offer my humble opinions for everyone to discuss:</p>
<p>1.  Separated vs. Communal Dining</p>
<p>A. Advantages and Disadvantages of Communal Dining: It is convenient, efficient, allows for a greater variety of dishes, and can cater to different tastes. These are the advantages. However, it is unhygienic and easily spreads diseases. These are the disadvantages.</p>
<p>B. Advantages and Disadvantages of Separated Dining: The only advantage is that separated dining can avoid direct and indirect transmission of diseases. However, it is monotonous, troublesome, easily becomes cold in winter, and it is difficult to cater to different tastes with three or more people. These are the obvious disadvantages of separated dining. As far as the author knows, when Ms. Zhang Mojun was the head of a women's normal school in Nanjing, she implemented a separated dining system for a time, but soon reverted to communal dining. When Mr. Guo Hongsheng was the head of Nanjing Higher Normal School, he implemented a separated dining system for quite a long time, where each person received one dish and one soup, or one meat dish and one vegetable dish, served in specially made tin utensils with compartments. Although they had grown accustomed to it, many still complained. However, because the school provided the meals, and they were encouraged to prioritize hygiene, everyone tolerated it. But after Dongda (National Southeastern University) was established, students mostly managed their own meals, and this system gradually fell into disuse. From this, it can be seen that separated dining is difficult to implement. As for families implementing separated dining, nothing has been heard of it.</p>
<p>C. Feasible Solution: Since separated dining has difficulties in terms of habit and economy, as mentioned above, and communal dining has terrible drawbacks, I believe there is a feasible solution that can take the strengths of both Western (separated) and Eastern (communal) dining, without their drawbacks. That is, each person should have two pairs of chopsticks, two spoons, and a small plate or saucer, for separating food and soup when taking it. Everything else remains the same. This idea is similar to Mr. Qi Xing's suggestion. The dining hall of the General Hospital of the Red Cross Society in this city implements this system, and there is no difficulty in implementing it at all. Various societies, organizations, and families can emulate it.</p>
<p>2. Food Quality: For staple food, it is indeed better to have wheat and mixed grains. However, in this city, it may not be easy to advocate this immediately. I believe it would be good to change breakfast to a bowl of noodles for each person, which seems to be widely feasible. In recent years, students at Tongji, Zhonggong, and various universities who have meal packages all have a bowl of noodles for breakfast, and people from all over eat it, which can serve as evidence. As for dishes, it is better to have more vegetables than meat, and more fresh than pickled. I believe that the local health authorities or medical organizations should create and publish a dietary chart based on the principles of economy and hygiene for us to improve our diet. As for beverages, plain boiled water is best.</p>
<p>3. Cleaning of Bowls, Plates, Spoons, and Chopsticks: This issue is the core of reforming the dining problem. After each meal, a dedicated person should be responsible for or supervise the cleaning. They must be washed with boiling water! It is best to boil them all in a pot! Otherwise, the spread of disease will still be difficult to avoid, which is equivalent to not making any changes!</p>
<p>4. The Kitchen Cleaning Cloth: Germs from typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and other dangerous diseases can often be transmitted from the market vegetables to the kitchen, from the cook's hands to the cleaning cloth, and from the cleaning cloth to the bowls, plates, spoons, and chopsticks!

<h3 id="e205">A Glimpse Inside the Dining Hall <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Thirteen-Year-Old</p>
<p>"The side dishes are terrible today. How are we supposed to eat with this?"</p>
<p>Amidst the clamor in the dining hall of XX School, student XXX said at the dining table. A then added, "As long as everyone contributes ten cents, six people have sixty cents, adding two bowls of dishes, isn't the problem solved?"</p>
<p>"Bah!," another fat person said, "I don't even have the money for ice cream today, and it's hot. You want to add more dishes?"</p>
<p>"Then what should we do? Not having good side dishes isn't good business," XX said sadly.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" a strategist said after a while, "Who will catch a fly? Wait until the side dishes are almost finished, then put the fly at the bottom of the bowl, and then go to the kitchen to question them. That will do it!"</p>
<p>So XX ran out with a smile, and soon brought one back (its origin is unknown; perhaps it came from the latrine) and gave it to the strategist.</p>
<p>Thus 丨 so 丨 the negotiation was settled.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the cook brought in a steaming bowl of dishes. People at other tables saw it and salivated. XX then said,</p>
<p>"As expected, you live up to your reputation, you are indeed a Han Xin of the sheep country."</p>

<h3 id="e206">Wanting to Be a Godmother <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou · ·</p>
<p>The neighbors across the way have been arguing these past few days. After inquiring, it turned out that a joke had turned serious. This is truly the work of mediocre people!</p>
<p>A sister-in-law who lives in the attic room recently came from the countryside. While chatting with the landlady of the second floor in the guest room, she mentioned that she had a godmother in the countryside. Upon hearing this, the landlady became interested. She was naturally fond of small talk, so she said with a smile to the sister-in-law in the attic room, "That's good. You have a godmother in the countryside, so have one in Shanghai too. How about recognizing me as your godmother?"</p>
<p>The sister-in-law in the attic room knew that she was just making small talk, so she smiled and pretended to agree. However, the landlady took it seriously and started calling her "dear baby" and "sweetheart" without any reservations. She even wanted her to formally recognize her as her godmother on a chosen day. This put the sister-in-law in the attic room in an awkward position, because it was impossible to do so in reality. Generally, a godmother should be older in age, but she was more than ten years younger than the goddaughter. This kind of reversed kinship was a big joke. However, the landlady would not let it go, so the matter became difficult. Fortunately, the sister-in-law in the attic room understood. "Asking someone is not a loss. It's just a roll of the tongue." Since she was so eager to be a godmother, she would recognize her. Sure enough, on a certain day, she performed the ceremony like dry sons and daughters worshiping their dry parents. The whole thing was as ridiculous as a stage play!</p>
<p>But a godmother must have the rights of a godmother. Fortunately, this landlady had plenty of money. After giving the sister-in-law a "meeting fee," she also lavishly prepared a banquet to invite her goddaughter. At this time, everyone was happy. But the disastrous thing happened afterward.</p>
<p>According to custom, the goddaughter also had to prepare a meal to reciprocate the godmother. However, the sister-in-law in the attic room did not have much money and could not afford a lavish banquet. She could only use the four yuan she had received to prepare a simple meal. But the godmother would not agree. She insisted on having a banquet costing more than ten yuan. As a result, things went sour and they turned against each other. They forgot about the godmother and goddaughter relationship and started scolding each other loudly. Both of them were Ningbo natives, so their voices were particularly loud, and their art of scolding was especially skillful, causing a commotion throughout the alley.</p>
<p>It is now rumored that the sister-in-law in the attic room will definitely move out tomorrow morning, because they have been arguing for three days in a row and can no longer live together.</p>
<p>Alas! Not wanting to live a peaceful life, they looked for trouble to create a commotion. What a pity! Ah! This kind of thing can only happen in the alleys of Shanghai.</p>
