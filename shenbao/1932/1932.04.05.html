<p>時評</p>
<h3>介紹蘇聯的兒童敎育彬</h3>
<p>四四兒童節又和白駒過隙一般的過去了然而目前我國成千成萬的兒童所遭受的深重苦痛與兒童節的眞實意義是否曾在聰明的父兄和兒童敎育家的腦底激起一些微波。引起一點點作用呢。在此。我們特再簡略的介紹一點關於蘇聯兒童敎育的事情。以供國人比較研究和參考。蘇聯敎育的目的。是造成當作社會有用的一員。當作健全而有勞動能力。與滲透着社會的意識組織化的訓練。認識而且理解自己在自然及社會中的位置。明白其四週的現實。有能力建設社會主義社會的「社會人。」至於敎育方針則從初等敎育以至高等敎育。都由自然。勞動。社會的根本敎材之三部分。出發把國家建設的新分野上的全部文化革命都委之於敎育。這是蘇聯的新興敎育之特點許多人説新興的蘇俄。如今正是一個世界的敎育實騐室。確實的。在蘇聯人類的物質與精神的一切活動。都正在作一次新的實騐敎育不過是其正在實騐中的一端。</p>
<p>兒童敎育。在蘇聯尤其是被重視。因爲他們知道負荷建設社會主義之重責者。正是這一輩純潔活未受舊時代之薰陶的兒童所以與其説蘇聯兒童敎育的目的在於從今後不使蘇聯再有一代的兒童甚至一個兒童在無知與愚昩中長大母寗謂其在於培植此萬千幼苗都成爲撑持社會主義社</p>
<p>會的幹材。</p>
<p>關於兒童敎育。在學齡前。即喚起對於自然的興味。引入勞作的敎育。同時有組織地學習交際。以爲兒童社會性之發展與訓練。其方法。有託兒所。以保育勞動者及紅軍兵士的乳兒及嬰兒有幼穉園。以敎育較大的孩提。有所謂夏期的「兒童廣塲。」與冬期的「兒童廣塲。」以爲兒童夏期與冬期的運動保嬰機關。這種學校的工作。不僅是替代了兒童的父母的保育責任。使其得以自由工作。并且實爲父母社會敎育的中心。</p>
<p>至於身體有缺陷及知能發逹程度低的兒童。也爲之設有肓唖敎育機關與低能兒敎充機關再如一般無保護人之浮浪兒。及在敎育不適當的家庭中的兒。童又設有對少年之社會的保護敎育機關。如幼年館如少年館。未成年館等課以社會的敎育與勞動。</p>
<p>總之。蘇聯是國家實際担任了全國兒童的保姆的責任。他們不僅是使每一個兒童得活潑地生存而且使其以普遍的享受敎育。他們努力於促進兒童之生理學的合法的發育。維持并增進其健康同時更使其在和現實文化密切關聯之下。用其手與腦在生活的各方面活潑地學習實踐人類敎育的第一個階段。全蘇聯的兒童便是在這様的環境之下生長着少年的蘇聯也就在這様的環境之下生長着。</p>
<p>我國的兒童生活與兒童敎育的方法是怎様呢。在此我們希望我們的政府。以及父兄們。與兒童敎育家們作一次比較的考察。一次　密的深思。</p>

<h3>調查團由京西上情况</h3>
<p>附錄國聯處理中日糾紛經過</p>
<p>國聯調查團一行於四月一日在兩岸歡迎牌樓之燈火輝煌中、登隆和輪而上駛、行政院長汪精衛·外長羅文幹·及禇民誼等、均親送至輪上、國府及外部另派專員護送、其禮遇可謂隆矣、</p>
<p>隆和在長江中、爲較優之輪、外交部及代表處以四千一百二十四元之代價、將大餐間全部包下、艙分上下二層、調查團及中日代表居上層、餘均居下層、惟上層床位有限、西人有屈居於下者、以等級關係、嘖有煩言、其實倘越一步而至線連之統艙、不其有天堂地獄之感乎、</p>
<p>行駛長江輪船、除牯嶺避暑期中、大餐間有一二次人滿外、似未有如此次隆和之盛者、惟停留南京一日半之久、其他乘客、受累匪淺、買辦賠貼飯食、損失更不待論矣、</p>
<p>二日侵晨、船抵蕪湖、邪許聲中、有當地各界代表如警備司令談經國·公安局長趙經世·商會執行委員陳紹堂·報界崔亮工·及店員聯合會·工業聯合會十餘人、手執國旗、魚贯登舟、表示歡迎、維時不但調查團未起、即代表處人員亦未起、不得已乃由秘書長王廣圻氏、從臥榻中出而招待、允將其盛意轉逹、彼等以船將開行遂未久候而去、蕪湖報紙登載登載調查團之動靜甚詳、六時許、在輪埠已可購得具見該地報界近年之進步、</p>
<p>船過蕪湖天朗氣淸、風平浪靜、調查團中人有前未曾游中國或掦子江上游者、憑欄見兩岸柳綠花黃、漁嬉農樂、輕帆片片、掠輪而過、不禁脱口而出曰、佳哉、此誠天賦之國也、此種讚美、雖非矯飾、然具未完之語氣觀之、可爲之下一轉語曰、此誠天賦之國也、其如無人善爲治理何、李頓爵士雖在船中、工作不輟、各處發來之電或餽贈之物、均一一裁復、英人辦事認眞、可見一斑、代表處人員、爲斟酌漢口招待程序、平浦專車上床位分配、及北上各大城之停留時間等、工作亦甚忙、沿途遣人登岸發電知照、俾得先事準備、調查團之專車、因床位有限、不敷分配、凡無與該團同行必要者二十八人、將乘七日下午七時開行之平浦特别快車北上、中國代表處人員之赴東北、依照國聯議决、日人似無阻止理由、惟人數多　、或須商量、依照現有秘書總務招待編輯議案諸組人員、已逾百人、恐須抵北平後、始能最後决定通知調查團、</p>
<p>調查團及代表處之行李、託中國旅行社運、外交部曾派專員帮同照料、乃李頓爵士之白色鐵箱、忽失所在昔陸徵祥赴巴黎和會、路過橫浜、裝有重要文件之一箱、獨不翼而飛、故聞此消息者、均爲驚異、但今尙在尋問中、希望其無遺誤也、國際聯盟中匣秘書吳秀峯氏、此次亦隨調查團同行、據其所述國際聯盟處理中日糾紛之經過、可分三時期如下、當此調查期中、頗足吾人參考、</p>
<p>第一期（九月二十一日至十月八日）</p>
<p>甲·我國對於日本侵佔東省向國聯的起訴這次日本藉故以武力强佔東省、消息傳來、舉國震怒我國根據國聯公約第十一條、於九月二十一日、正式要求國聯行政院根據該條規定㈠立即設法阻止事件的擴大、以維持中日間和平㈡恢復九月十八日以前的原狀㈢審定賠償中國損失的範圍主其性質、</p>
<p>乙·國聯行政院第一次集會經過</p>
<p>㈠行政院主席的急令日兵在瀋陽發難適當國聯常年大會未終、而行政院又正在召集之際、該院遂於九月二十二日會議時、正式受理中國對於日本的起訴、然以事機緊急稍作討論、即議决由行政院主席西班牙外交部長雷露、一急電兩方停止軍事行動、以防事件擴大俾易得和平解决、二即與中日代表在兩國人民生命財產安全的範圍內協商立刻撤兵辦法、</p>
<p>查一九二五年、希臘軍隊侵入保加利亞國境的時候行政院亦曾召集緊急會議同時由主席電令兩方軍隊、不特應即停止軍事行動、且須立刻退回本國、但這次對於東省事件、其緊急决議之第二項、所謂由主席與兩方代表在兩國人民生命財產安全的範圍以內協商退兵辦法、而不敢援用先例命令日本馬上撤兵者、正國聯示弱的表示、亦即我們失望的開始、</p>
<p>㈡國聯與美國合作的運動國聯旣怕日本的强勢、不敢令其立刻撤兵、又要顧全自己的體面、求避免　懦的譏誚、所以不能不請出太平洋的霸主丨美國丨來合作、同時㈠因美國在華利益的重要關於太平洋的種種問題、非得美國參加不能解决　㈡因美國華府九國條約及非戰公約的主動國、而滿洲問題又和　有直接的　係、㈢因美國爲頭等海軍强國、欲　裁日本非依賴牠的實力不可㈣美國固非國聯會員、然其對於國聯的發展有極大關係、國聯如欲　到爲世界最高政治機關及維持世界和平之目的、實非得美國的協助不右、然而美國人民向抱不干涉别洲政治的門羅主義、所以國聯的組織、雖倡於　爾遜總統、而美國終未爲國聯的會員、但國聯對美的加入、尙未失望、每遇一事請其參加、所以國聯各種專門機關、莫不有美國代表、日本以武力佔據滿洲、不特危害世界和平、抑亦危害美國利益、故國聯亦樂得乘此機會邀請美國參加、以敦促其實行與國聯合作、</p>
<p>當行政院於九月二十二日第二次會議之際、英國代表薛西爾爵士、即提議將行政院關於討論滿洲問題的經過、臨時通知美國政府、使美政府對此問題、得獲完備的消息、而知採取正當的態度、日代表芳澤大使、當時以爲事屬平常、故未加反對、</p>
<p>當此决議案通過後、美政府遂於九月二十日與國聯以滿意的答覆、內謂美政府對於國聯處理滿案的緊急决議、甚表同情、并已令駐北平及東京美使、向中日兩方政府、作同様的勸告了、</p>
<p>㈢中日兩方的態度及辯論的情形我國對於日本侵略的控告、乃於九月二十一日用書面提出、二十二日上下午行政院舉行第二第三次會議時、我國代表施肇基公使、遂要求行政院立刻設法恢復九月十八日以前的狀態、及派員調查損失與肇事的責任、并謂我國政府對於東省事件、决採取不抵抗主義、全聽國聯去處理、論者有指責此種外交爲依賴國聯、實則在肇事責任未明、對日戰爭全無準備、暫不抵抗、未始非計、蓋能將保障我國領土完整之一部分責任、加於國聯身上、使牠不能擺脱、換句話説、以國聯作我們的先鋒、而我們仍可在後方作軍事的準備、可惜國聯先鋒隊、每戰皆北、而我們又不思準備、並繼續其不抵抗主義、以自誤耳、</p>
<p>日代表芳澤大使宣稱、日本旅滿僑民數十萬、財產價值二十萬萬元皆有條約爲之保障、而年來中國政府恣意蹂躪、這是中日衝突之遠因、至最近不幸事件的發生、由於中國軍隊炸毀南滿鐵路、故過在中國而不在日本、他接到國內報告説、中國方面已提議直接交涉、他深信只有直接交涉、才能逹到和平解决的目的、</p>
<p>九月二十五日行政院舉行第四次會議時、日政府令其代表答覆行政院主席九月二十二之急電、對於該電第一項令兩方停止攻擊、以待調解、謂「日本政府自始至終、除關於保護日人生命財產的必要行動外、曾極力阻止事件的擴大、」對於第二項撤兵問題、則謂「日本現已開始撤兵、完全撤退、須以日僑生命財產的安全爲條件、」日代表并宣讀日政府九月二十四日的宣言、內容謂」日本對於滿洲、絕無領土野心、現在的衝突、乃因中國軍隊毀壞南滿鐵路而起、日本爲自衛計、故有此軍事行動云、我國施代表繼亦宣讀國民政府對於行政院主席急電之答覆、內容除致謝國聯之調停外、堅持日本須立刻撤兵之議、至於日僑生命財產的保障、我國允負完全責任、施代表又以肇事眞相兩方報告旣有不同、則最公平的辦法、就是請國聯派員就地調查、同時并否認我國有直接交涉的提議、</p>
<p>二十八日、復開第五次會議大致討論派員調查問題、無結果而散、</p>
<p>㈣行政院的五頭會議所謂五頭會議、就是英·德·意·法·及西班牙·代表所組織的秘密會議、根據九月二十二日的决議案、除由行政院電令兩方停止軍事行動外、并請主席與兩方代表協商撤兵辦法所以由二十二至二十九數日間、無一日無五頭會議的召集、此種會議作用、在預商撤兵辦法、俾再提出與中日兩方代表討論、其所謂撤兵辦法、乃由國聯派員就地調查眞相、俾可（Ａ）證明肇事責任在於何方、設使南滿鐵路的炸斷、乃日軍故意自爲、藉作進兵口實、則我國所受損失、日本當負責賠償、（Ｂ）可證明日僑生命財產、在中日糾紛未發生以前、并未受我們的危害、若使日軍即將維持治安之權交還吾國、那我國政府、必能予日僑切實之保護、所以假使以上兩個問題都得解决、那日本將失其不能撤兵的理由了、然而日代表强辯、祗謂中日之事、惟中日才能直接解决國聯的干涉、適足以延長解决的時日、中國政府雖已宣言允負保護日僑生命財產的責任、惟事實上中國中央政府的命令、不能及於各省、日本永不能相信一紙空言眞能保護日人的安全、故不得不謀以自衛」云、於是派員調查之提議、以日代表一人的反對不能通過、結果祗允各國單獨派其駐華武官就地探聽消息、報告於各本國政府、再由各國政府轉知國聯而已東省爲我國領土、吾人本有單獨請求國聯派員調查之權、但卒以日代表曾宣言國聯若不尊重日本的意旨那日本不負保護調查員之責任、而國聯亦無可如何、</p>
<p>㈤九月三十日之决議案定期撤兵及派員調查旣遭日本的反對、而會　又不能不作暫時的結束、行政院遂於九月三十日一致通過一决議案該决議案大意謂「根據日本政府宣言、日本在滿並無領土野心、又根據日本代表宣言、亦稱在日僑生命財產安全範　之內擬於最短期間完全撤退其在南滿路界外之軍隊、又根據中國代表宣言、謂中國政府允負保護日僑生命財產之責任、爰請中日兩方政府實踐上述宣言、及將消息隨時報告行政院、同時行政院决定於十月十四日從新召集會議、以便審查、但若因特别情形提前召集、不在此例、又届時如行政院主席以爲無召集之必要、則十月十四日集會之議、可以取消」云、根據該决議案最後一段説、届時如行政院主席以爲無集會的必要時、可以取消前議可見當時各國的心理、以爲日本爲世界頭等列强國、向講信義、今行政院之决議旣不限期撤兵、以保全其所謂神聖不可侮辱之帝國體面、則於十月十四日以前料其必能自動撤兵、免破壞國聯公約的罪名、</p>
<p>此次中日糾紛發生、適值我國被選爲行政院委員、我國政府已委施肇基公使爲代表、誠屬幸事、施公使的態度和平、主張强硬措詞得體、尤得各國人士之敬仰、比較日代表之狂吸雪茄、冷靜　情、而發言又隻字吐出、令人不能久耐、實有天壤之别、至於九月三十日的决議案、不特不敢限期撤兵、甚至派員調查、亦因日本反對作爲罷論、實爲國聯畏縮無能之表現、至我國外交、雖不説是成功、亦不能説是失敗、因爲東省之未能重覩天日、實因我國內政糾紛靡止、及列强之化使世界各國與日本對抗、而令日本陷於孤立地位矣、（未完）</p>

<h3>忍痛開市</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>海上各界。自從罷市以來。直到四月一日。始忍痛復業。在這兩個多月內。百業停頓。地方糜爛。不論直接間接所受的損失。幾乎難以數字計算。在戰區內的居民。已以毀家蕩產。而在戰區外的商店。爲了顧客的死亡逃避。歇業倒閉。已民沒有蹤跡可尋。所放的賬欵。一時難以收集。即使他們還存在。可是所有產業已補摧毀無遺。大半已沒有能力。否則前賬不清。新貨難進。雖開市。恐怕不易繼續營業。兼之交通尚未恢復。而外埠多不明滬地真相。風聲謠傳。都是裏足不前，雖然忍痛復業前途。未許樂觀。</p>
<p>回憶日本東京當大地震以後。情況的悲慘。殆與現在相同。然而他們因爲得了政府的援助。和各方的體諒。加以商業道德交易信用等關系。能以互助的精神。打破危急的難關。所以不數年。就能恢復市場的繁榮。這次我們爲了禦外侮而遭犧牲其與天災的性質大不相同。所以各方尤須共體時艱。互相調解。切不可對於受害的商店或顧客勒逼過甚。自相傾軋。反爲強暴者所貽笑。</p>
<p>現在地方各界。已傾其全力。籌商善後的辦法。銀錢業也爲顧念大局。設法通融。縱不能一時恢復舊觀。但也可以維持市面。茍延殘喘。惟有一點還請各界特別注意者。我們受這加空前的浩刦。各人腦袋中當然有深刻不忘的印象。聽說最近我們心痛的貨物。行將源源而來。倘若再不稍覺悟。那末眞糟到極點了。</p>
<h3>記石瑛修建普濟道院</h3>
<p>— 甫髯</p>
<p>吳縣閶門外白馬澗鎮西二里餘。有名賀九嶺者。一小山也。上有普濟道院。風景絕佳。頗宜修養。惟院屋破幾。久鮮人居。廼去處十二月間。忽煥然一新。往探之。始知爲石瑛所修。蓋瑛自浙主席張難先去逼供後。即隨而辭去建設廳長。有感於世局艱難。人心詭譎。故悠然而隱棲於彼。一切修建。皆出自己囊。院內共六人。二爲司灑掃炊爨啟閉者。亦其鄉人。一爲老道。終日伴瑛談論者。瑛自亦道裝。二爲其子。於前月始來。由其父親自敎讀。當其子之來也。所有行李。令鄉婦肩之上山。給以四百文。實則對折已足。瑛知之大怒。責以混賬。蓋惡其故示闊綽也。於是可知其嚴矣。瑛來時。所帶行李無我我。除臥被外。惟書籍一箱而已。不失書生本色。待人亦頗和氣。本鎮自去冬始設郵箱。惟地處僻野。信札極少。日不過三四封而已。自瑛來後。遽然增多。每日往返。彼個人必占址數件。郵票以是而得暢銷也。一笑。</p>
<h3>我想</h3>
<p>— 葉愼抱</p>
<p>我想乘飛艇。飛過喜馬拉耶山之頂。看世從爭權奪利。求田問井。如發狂疾。如醉酩酊。斯時我倘進忠言。仍恐言孤聲弱而無聽。安得消除自私自利之偏見。煑爲解脫煩惱之香茗。乞雲娘爲予駕飛機。更風伯引途以爲並。請雨師代灑於法寰。使人們如醍醐之灌頂。個個覺悟。個個清醒。（卻酬）</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第四回　婚約逼人來游移自擾　㓂氛掠地去孬始重探</p>
<p>話說李問霞拾著了那個金盒子。舉向安玉田眼面前晃了一晃。厲聲的問這是什麼。安玉田便好似在晴天猛聞著個大焦雷。嚇得呆住在一邊。只不住偷瞧。李問霞那鐵青般含有怒意的臉色。又低下頭歸服觀鼻口問心的那麼苦苦思導著。這真是糟糕極啦。無端被伊抓信了這個把柄。這敎我怎生說法呢。明明認得這盒兒是梁笑雲的。剛才竟遺落在這裏。當是伊梳洗時用完過後。忽地與我說笑了幾句。就忘記帶走了。我又一時大意。只顧催著茶房收拾碗盞。卻未曾檢點到這點小物事。然而對於李問霞。究是不能照實直說的呀。窘了一陣。漸想出個搪塞的計策來。可是搔首抓腮。舉動上終透露出不甚自然。只故意哦哦連聲的答道。是了。我想起來了。這定是剛才我那位同學身邊的東西。他急於要看電影去。走得怱忙。便遺失在這兒。如今被你無意拾著。不獨你好生奇怪。連我也是詫異的了不得。思索了好一會。才想起來。你須要明白。我是向來不喜用這種女性的化妝品物的呀。李間霞卻還是不信。憤憤然批駁道。胡說。你剛才不說過是位男同學嗎。怎麼他會用女人的東西。安玉田面紅耳赤的又忙忙爭辯道。你這是不清楚我那位男同學的性格呀。他這個人。不似我這麼老實。專喜結交女友。又常愛偷取女友們身邊所帶著的零碎東西。今天大概是在我這裏吃完飯後。就悄悄取出他這個偷來的小盒兒來。洗了一把臉。搽了許多粉在臉上。裝扮成個唱花旦的戲子一樣。預備去電影院應什麼女友之約。我因了心下煩悶沒留意他這些個動作。想不到倒引起你一片懷疑。說罷。見茶房已沖好一壺熱茶來。就隨手斟了一杯。遞與李問霞。又道。請喝茶吧。別再犯這種無謂的疑心了。李問霞接過茶杯。徐徐喝了幾口。念他這樣辯白雖也還說得過去。但空間還有些不放心。就淡淡的說道。也許這就是實情吧。想必你也未必就這樣毫無心肝。在這家破親亡的時候。還招惹些倡門中下賤的女子。到公寓來秘密取樂。不過我還是要多一句嘴。這東西就算是你那個不要臉的男同學的。像這種朋友你往後也得與他少交。近朱者赤。近墨者黑。怕他自會引誘你一道兒下渾水的呀。安玉田聽伊口齒還是如此犀利。就裝腔作勢的長嘆了一聲道。你忒多心了。我何嘗就是那樣無把握的人。只是你老這樣地不相信我。卻眞敎我難過得很。說罷。走到床面前打橫躺下。還唉聲嘆氣個不休不歇。</p>

<h3>訂緍廣告</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>「我倆承某某兩先生介紹、並得雙方家長之同意、謹於某月某日、在滬訂婚、國難方殷、俗禮槪免、特此奉告諸親友公鑒、」</p>
<p>像這様的一類廣告，自一二八滬變以來，報紙上差不多天天可見，或者一天竟可以尋得到幾個這様的廣告，蠻好！國難當前，機會難得，價廉物美，莫要錯過這様大好機會。</p>
<p>變愛救國，原是現在最新鮮，最時髦的一個名詞。只要化去三四塊大洋，就可以完成我倆的終身大事，建築我倆的愛情墳墓。天空軋軋的飛機，看牠則甚丨崑山太倉等處的砲聲，聽牠則甚！吳淞江灣閘北等處的慘狀，不干我事，管牠則甚！稱心如意，天作之合，我願天下有情人多成眷屬。</p>
<p>但是這一類的廣告，若照我分晰起來，其中至少右分兩種。一種是愛情熱烈，借此公開的。一種是經濟壓迫，藉此節省的。惟在國難方殷的時候，這種愛情，是否可以永保。若云經濟壓迫，則結婚之後，在一方又須加上一重負擔，經濟豈不是愈加困難了麽？總之，靑年時代的要素，不在婚姻，婚姻的確不是終身的大事。求學是終身大事，職業是終身大事。欲完成國民的最大志願，最要使命，是終身大事。</p>
<p>果然，從前的婚姻禮節，太麻煩，太浪費，太繁文褥節，令人十分厭惡。現在新式的「廣告訂婚」。似最爲易简而可行。果如此，則不但國難方殷，一切俗禮可以槪免，即不是國難方殷，旣云俗禮，亦無不可槪免。何必定要借國難方殷的一個大題目，爲完成你們愛情表示的禮數呢？</p>
<p>試問國難方殷，是你們訂婚的時期麽？國難方殷，是你們結婚的時期麽？古人有「國幾不國無以家爲。」今人有「國難方殷結婚啓事。」相映成趣，無怪有人説古今人不相及呢！</p>

<h3>火藥</h3>
<p>— 孟復</p>
<p>火藥（Ｐｏｗｄｅｒ）在古時就有了，我國也使用得很早到了近代，科學昌明，火藥的用途益廣，不論在工業上，軍事上部佔了重要的位置，尤其是在軍事上，因爲現代的戰爭，差不多是以火藥爲中心的，假使世界上的火藥完全没有了，人類問永久和平的希望也許能夠實現·現在我國外侮日迫，自衛的戰爭恐怕是無法避免了，所以特地把火藥提出，作一個简單的研究·</p>
<p>火藥究竟是什麽？火藥者，受衝擊力或熱力，即起劇烈之變化，發生高熱及多量氣體之不定化合物或混合物之名稱也依組成之性質，可分爲混合火藥與化合火藥二大類，略述在下面：</p>
<p>（Ａ）混合火藥</p>
<p>（一）黑色火藥丨此藥可算是火藥中的鼻祖，由硝石（ＫＮＯｍ）硫黃（Ｓｕｌｐｈｕｒ）</p>
<p>和木炭三物混合而成·三物分量之比，最普通大槪是硝石百分之七十五，硫黃百分之十，木炭百分之十五·以木炭爲燃燒之主體，硝石含養氣甚多，即由此支助燃燒，硫黃具可燃性和粘結性，可助木炭之燃燒及粘結木炭與硝石，使不分離而增加爆發作用·自從無烟火藥發明後，幾乎要淘汰了此藥，不過現在仍用作礦山的低力爆發藥及緩燃的導火綫等·</p>
<p>（二）褐色火藥丨此藥係黑色火藥之變體，亦爲木炭、硝石、硫黃、混合而成·不過木炭、硝石、硫黄、混合而成日褐色·爆發力田較黑色火藥高，從前皆用作發射藥，不過無烟火藥出世，也漸漸絕跡了·</p>
<p>（Ｂ）化合火藥</p>
<p>（一）硝化棉系烟火藥丨取淸凈之棉花，浸於硝酸（ＮｉｔｒｉｃＡｃｉｄＨＮＯ３）</p>
<p>與硫酸（ＳｕｌｐｈｕｒｉｃＡｃｉｄＨ２ＳＯ４）之混合液中，二者相化合，即生一種硝化纖維素·但硝化纖維素不止一種，依硝化度之高下而分，大槪可得八種，凡硝化物不溶解於酒精及以脱（Ｅｔｈｅｒ）之混合液中者，謂之强棉火藥·能溶解者·謂之弱棉火藥·取適量之强棉及弱棉火藥之藥棉混合·依法即可製成藥粒，現今槍今</p>
<p>砲子彈中皆用之·因此藥發火正確，而且爆力甚大，又燃燒後，全體火藥，皆成氣體，不餘殘渣，如此可使槍砲身筒不致污穢，實在是發射火藥中最良好的·</p>
<p>（二）硝化甘油系無烟火藥丨加純粹甘油於硝酸及硫酸之混合液中，過半小時，二者相化合而成硝化甘油，取適量之棉火藥，加於硝化甘油中，依法亦可製成此種無烟火藥，性質與硝化棉火藥大抵相同·且爆發力較强，就發射力上講，似爲有利，惟爆發之温度過高，砲身易遭炸燬，此一點實爲不及硝化棉火藥·製造價尚低廉，因爆發力强大，故開礦等工業上所用之爆發藥，大槪以此藥作主要成分·</p>
<p>最第要講火藥的威力，大槪火藥每一基羅（Ｋｉｌｏｇｒａｍｍ），爆發時所發生的氣體，比火藥原有的體積，要大萬餘倍·十六吋口徑之大砲彈，（重約一千餘斤）自發動至砲口，僅需百分之四秒·此尙是低級火藥，高級强烈火藥之威力·眞是不堪設想啊！</p>
<p>火藥的種類，尙有多種，現在不過舉其主要的幾種而已·詳細的火藥製造法亦從略，因爲在大衆科學上的東西，應該大衆化一點，上面所講，不過要使讀者們對於火藥有一些認識罷了·</p>

<h3>Introducing Soviet Children's Education</h3>
<p>The Double Fourth Children's Day has passed like a fleeting white horse. However, have the profound sufferings endured by tens of thousands of children in our country and the true meaning of Children's Day stirred up any ripples in the minds of our intelligent fathers, brothers, and educators? Has it triggered even a little action? Here, we will briefly introduce some aspects of Soviet children's education for our countrymen to compare, study, and reference. The purpose of Soviet education is to cultivate individuals who are useful members of society, healthy and capable of labor, and imbued with social consciousness and organized training, who recognize and understand their place in nature and society, understand the reality around them, and have the ability to build a socialist society. As for the educational policy, from primary education to higher education, it is based on the three fundamental components of natural science, labor, and society, entrusting the entire cultural revolution in the new fields of national construction to education. This is the characteristic of the emerging education in the Soviet Union. Many people say that the emerging Soviet Russia is now a world's education laboratory. Indeed, in the Soviet Union, all human material and spiritual activities are undergoing a new experiment, and education is just one aspect of this experiment.</p>
<p>Children's education is particularly valued in the Soviet Union. Because they know that the burden of building socialism rests on this generation of pure, lively children who have not been influenced by the old era. Therefore, rather than saying that the purpose of Soviet children's education is to prevent any child in the Soviet Union from growing up in ignorance and ignorance in the future, Mother Ning said that it is to cultivate these thousands of young seedlings into pillars of socialist society.</p>
<p>Regarding children's education, before school age, it is to arouse interest in nature, introduce labor education, and systematically learn social skills to develop and train children's sociality. The methods include nurseries to care for the infants and babies of laborers and Red Army soldiers, kindergartens to educate older children, and so-called summer "children's playgrounds" and winter "children's playgrounds" as institutions for children's summer and winter sports and childcare. The work of these schools not only replaces the childcare responsibilities of children's parents, allowing them to work freely, but is also actually the center of social education for parents.</p>
<p>As for children with physical defects and low cognitive development, special education institutions for the blind and deaf and institutions for the mentally retarded are also established. Furthermore, for general unprotected street children and children in families with inadequate education, there are also social protection and education institutions for young people, such as juvenile halls and adolescent halls, which provide social education and labor.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union, as a state, actually assumes the responsibility of being the nanny for all the children in the country. They not only ensure that every child survives vigorously but also enables them to enjoy universal education. They strive to promote the physiological and legal development of children and maintain and improve their health. At the same time, they enable them to learn and practice actively in all aspects of life with their hands and brains, closely linked to real-world culture, which is the first stage of human education. The children of the entire Soviet Union are growing up in such an environment, and the young Soviet Union is also growing up in such an environment.</p>
<p>What are the methods of children's life and education in our country? Here, we hope that our government, fathers, brothers, and educators will conduct a comparative study and a careful reflection.</p>
<h3>Armistice Conference Nearly Breaks Down Again</h3>
<p>No Results on Troop Withdrawal Location and Time Yesterday</p>
<p>General Assembly Adjourns for Two Days to Seek Alternative Solutions</p>
<p>Subcommittee Meeting on the 6th, General Assembly on the 7th</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Armistice Troop Withdrawal Conference was still held at the British Consulate yesterday at 3:00 PM. The subcommittee meeting was also held at the same time, but the discussion yielded no results and nearly broke down. Under the mediation of friendly countries, efforts were made to find alternative solutions during the adjournment period. The General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene at 10:00 AM on Thursday, and the subcommittee meeting will continue its discussions at 3:00 PM on Wednesday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>General Assembly Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's 11th formal</p>
<p>meeting was held at 3:00 PM. The representatives from all parties remained the same. Our representatives arrived at the meeting first, followed by the chargés d'affaires and counselors from friendly countries, and then the Japanese representatives. During the meeting, the representatives chatted and laughed. Discussions began at 3:20 PM. First, the British Minister delivered a speech, stating briefly that the Sino-Japanese Armistice Troop Withdrawal Conference had been held 11 times since the 24th, lasting a total of 34 hours. Although the results were not equal to zero, they were not far from it. The main issues of this conference have not been resolved, and the previously agreed items cannot be implemented sequentially. Therefore, it is hoped that today's meeting will seek a satisfactory solution to the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal. After the British Minister finished speaking, the Japanese Chief Representative Ueda spoke, stating that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is closely related to the issue of the withdrawal location. Earlier, the subcommittee stated that the Japanese army could withdraw from the front line to the public concession and the adjacent area of the extended road within four weeks. Regarding this statement, the Japanese representative stated that it was not completely decided, because the withdrawal period is closely related to the location. The Japanese representative's statement of completing the withdrawal in four weeks was only a temporary indication, and the specific decision would depend on future circumstances. Regarding the location, especially the location of the Chinese troops' defense, it is closely related to the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Therefore, the Japanese representative in the subcommittee requested the Chinese representative to explain the situation of the Chinese troops stationed south of the Suzhou River. The Japanese authorities believe that this request is closely related to the withdrawal of Japanese troops, so it is necessary to make a clear statement and ask the Chinese representatives present to explain. After Ueda finished speaking, our Chief Representative Guo Wai-ci immediately refuted him, stating that regarding the Japanese representative's request in the subcommittee to explain the situation of the Chinese troops south of the Suzhou River, not only did the Chinese representatives at the time express their opposition, but the counselors of various friendly countries also found it strange. It should be known that this discussion is not within the scope of this conference. It must be known that the only mission of this conference is to cease fire and withdraw troops. The principles of discussion were determined in advance, and no other issues were discussed. Moreover, this request from the Japanese representative concerns China's sovereignty. The Chinese troops are stationed on their own territory and their actions are completely free and not subject to any restrictions. The Japanese side has no need to inquire about it, especially since the Chinese troops in Nanshi never participated in this battle at all. After Guo finished speaking, the Japanese representative Ueda repeatedly stated that the reason why the Japanese army wanted to understand the Chinese troops stationed south of the Suzhou River was to avoid the danger of the rear and the side during the withdrawal period, so they had to understand it. Therefore, he repeatedly asked Guo whether there were any Chinese troops stationed there. Guo listened to the speech and replied in a simple tone, stating that he had not prepared to answer this point in advance, because the principles of negotiation had been stipulated long ago, and this inquiry was illogical. As for the Japanese army's claim that they had to do so to avoid danger during the withdrawal period, he asked, "Nanshi and Zhabei are separated by two concessions. Where does the danger of Japanese troop withdrawal come from?" The Japanese representative listened to Guo's words and said that this inquiry was not a problem between soldiers and soldiers. It must be known that although Nanshi and Zhabei are separated by concessions, cannons can bombard them, and even rifles can reach them. Therefore, it is even more necessary to understand the situation of the Chinese troops. After the Japanese representative finished speaking, our representative Guo Wai-ci firmly rejected it, stating that this is a ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference, not a war preparation conference. It should be discussed according to principles. The British Minister Lambson also stated that the Japanese side does not need to worry about this issue, because once the ceasefire and troop withdrawal are implemented, the hostile actions have completely stopped. If the Japanese army encounters danger, there are representatives of friendly countries in the joint committee to investigate. After the British Minister Lambson finished speaking, the ministers of various friendly countries also echoed him. At this point, the Japanese side abandoned the original proposal, but the repeated debate had taken two hours. Then, our Guo Wai-ci spoke, stating that regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the Chinese side has made great concessions because the Japanese representative has repeatedly stated that there are a large number of troops, allowing the Japanese representative to temporarily station troops in the adjacent area of the public concession and the extended road for a stipulated time. Now, the Japanese side firmly refuses to express its views on the time issue. This is the only focus of the future of the conference. It must be known that if the date cannot be determined, this conference will not end. If the Chinese side is asked to sign without obtaining a definite troop stationing time, this not only violates public opinion, but the government authorities have also repeatedly instructed that there should be no signature solution to the issue of the term. Therefore, it is requested that the Japanese side quickly stipulate a troop stationing time so that it can restore the situation before January 28th. The Japanese representative Shigemitsu listened to the speech and said that regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the Japanese side is currently planning a special method for automatic withdrawal, but the time issue has not been stipulated. If a definite time is stipulated, it seems to indicate that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is obviously due to being forced. Representative Guo then refuted him, stating that what we are talking about is troop withdrawal. If a time is not stipulated, what is the difference between abandoning the troop withdrawal negotiations halfway? Therefore, the date on which the Japanese army can restore the original state before January 28th must be specified in detail in the conference. When Guo said this, the Japanese representative remained silent. At that time, the table was silent. Seeing the situation, the British Minister Lambson said that the neutral country representatives have worked hard to hold this Sino-Japanese Armistice Conference. If both sides insist, the future is worrying. I respectfully hope that both sides will approach each other and make the conference a success with the qualifications of friendly country representatives. At this time, under no circumstances should it break down. After the British Minister Lambson finished speaking, our Representative Guo stated that the Chinese side is sincere in the Armistice Troop Withdrawal Conference. Now, the troop withdrawal does not have a definite date, which violates the original intention of this conference. The Chinese side will never give in on this. The Japanese representative also stated that the Japanese side wants the troop withdrawal deadline to be as soon as possible, but it must wait for the stability of the local situation. Our representative Dai Ji said that the situation in Shanghai has already been restored, and the lifting of the martial law in the two concessions is a clear proof. The Japanese representative said that although the curfew in the concession has been lifted, the martial law order still exists. Dai then refuted him, stating that the existence of the martial law order in the concession is due to the fact that the Japanese troops have not withdrawn. The two sides argued repeatedly, and another hour has passed, with no results. The British Minister said that the discussion on the timing issue has reached four hours. Please report the situation of this meeting to the government and ask for instructions. Guo said that I do not need to ask for instructions. I received instructions from the government this morning. In short, it is difficult to discuss unless the Japanese side explains the complete withdrawal period. Shigemitsu said that I also received instructions from the Tokyo government and cannot complete the withdrawal on a limited date. The British Minister advised the two sides not to do so and asked the two sides to find a way. One side reported to the government, and the other side sought a solution. The General Assembly was postponed until 10:00 AM on Thursday, and it was already 6:00 PM. Then the meeting broke up.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Meeting Military subcommittee,</p>
<p>also held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of troop withdrawal locations. Our representatives, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army Huang Qiang, Japanese representative Washichiro Tashiro, and representatives of relevant countries, British military attaché San Er, US embassy military attaché Tris Tell, French embassy military attaché Penna Weitai, and Italian embassy military attaché Farah Tirani attended. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. Regarding the troop withdrawal locations, although there was no objection from both sides regarding the area around the International Sports Ground in Jiangwan and the area around Yinxiang Port, there was still no concrete decision yesterday regarding the area from the Japanese Cemetery to the 63 Flower Garden in Zhabei and the area around Wusong Town. It was also heard that the Japanese side had made further demands regarding Wusong, including the Wusong Fort. Our side firmly opposed this, so it was decided to ask the chief representatives of both sides for instructions again. As for the area from Tanziwan to Chadaijiao, the intersection of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, the Japanese side formally gave up and no longer raised it for discussion.</p>
<p>Meeting Communiqué The 11th Armistice Meeting</p>
<p>The communiqué issued last night stated that the 11th Armistice Meeting was held at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the troop withdrawal deadline in detail, hoping that the opinions of both sides could converge. The meeting is now adjourned and will reconvene on Thursday morning. The Military Subcommittee issued a public statement last night stating that the Military Subcommittee continued to discuss the various plans for troop withdrawal and the appropriate nature of the retreat locations. The discussion has reached a point where both parties need to ask the chief representatives for instructions. The meeting is now adjourned and will reconvene at 3:00 PM on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>British Minister's Proposal British Minister Lan Puson, in order to</p>
<p>reconcile the opinions of both sides, had proposed a compromise in the middle of last week, as the stalemate between the two sides in this Armistice Troop Withdrawal Conference was due to the determination or uncertainty of the time. According to reporters from Hua Dong News Agency, the content of the proposal did not stipulate the withdrawal time, but it was more practical and concrete than the Japanese representative's vague proposal. However, both China and Japan have rejected this new proposal.</p>
<p>Japanese General's Statement The Japanese side will issue an</p>
<p>external statement, which roughly states that they do not want to limit the time for the withdrawal of Japanese troops and are willing to withdraw troops automatically. The statement will be issued after it is signed.</p>
<h3>Frontline Sentinel Conflict</h3>
<p>Kunshan, 4th Special Dispatch: In recent days, enemy troops and plainclothes teams have often harassed the area around Hengli Bridge in Taicang. Our army has set up defenses on the main roads in the area. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, dozens of enemy plainclothes teams came to harass again. When they reached the main road, they were suddenly ambushed, and many were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 4th Special Dispatch: On the evening of the 3rd, more than 200 enemy sentries arrived at Luduqiao. Our ambush killed or wounded 50 or 60 enemies. They retreated, and we only suffered 5 or 6 casualties. A total of 1,500 to 1,600 refugees from various places fled to Shatou due to food shortages. It is hoped that neighboring counties will provide relief.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese War Machine Has Not Gone</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Expresses</p>
<p>Military Will Not Take Offensive, Then Shanghai War Will Not Reappear</p>
<p>British Newspaper Holds Strict View</p>
<p>Saying Japanese Troops Not Withdrawing Is Enough to Promote Serious Situation</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, 4th, Tokyo: There are those here who fear that the Shanghai war may reappear, but according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman today, if the Chinese army does not take the offensive, there is no worry about war in Shanghai. The spokesman continued that the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry have recently received petitions from the public, stating that Japan has made great concessions to China and should not make any further concessions.</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, 4th, London: The Menksede Guidance Report today stated in an editorial that the current situation in the Far East often contains the danger of renewed war, stating that the Japanese army's long-term occupation of Chinese land in Manchuria or Shanghai often has the danger of irregular incidents and may even promote a serious Sino-Japanese war. Japan has repeatedly made excuses for the poor governance of the Chinese government and the threat to the lives and property of Japanese residents. In fact, the policies implemented by Japan have caused a huge amount of destruction to lives and property, causing tens of thousands of Japanese residents to abandon their homes, making the Chinese people's anti-Japanese sentiment increasingly fierce, and making the situation even more chaotic than before. The article concluded, "China, after a very good battle against Japan, is unwilling to make any concessions, which has led to today's stalemate."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and His Wife Returned to Nanjing by Plane Yesterday</h3>
<p>No Results in Urging Sun Ke to Go to Nanjing</p>
<p>Jiang Guangding and Dai Ji Met with Wang Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Wang Talked About the Nature of the National Crisis Conference</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the National Government's Executive Yuan, and his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, took a plane from Nanjing to Shanghai the morning before yesterday at 10:30 to visit Sun Ke, deal with important official matters, and conveniently seek medical treatment. Wang met with Jiang Guangnai and Dai Ji at his residence yesterday morning. Sun Ke also returned the visit yesterday afternoon and had a long conversation. Wang and his wife returned to Nanjing by plane at 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Visit to Song Ziwen Yesterday morning at 8:00, Wang and his wife</p>
<p>went to the hospital for medical treatment and returned to the residence half an hour later. They met with Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi to discuss the progress of the armistice conference. At 9:00, Finance Minister Song Ziwen sent Tang Hai'an to invite Wang to meet with him. Wang took the same car with Tang to Song's residence on Qiqi Road for a meeting and returned to the residence at 10:00.</p>
<p>Meet with Jiang Guangding The Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Jiang Guangding and Dai Ji, our military representative attending the armistice conference, visited Wang's residence at 10:10 AM. They discussed the armistice conference for a long time. Jiang and Dai left at 10:40 AM.</p>
<p>Wang and Sun's Conversation Former President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke</p>
<p>visited Wang's residence in person yesterday afternoon and had a pleasant conversation. Wang expressed his strong desire to urge Sun to go to Nanjing immediately to face the national crisis together. His words were extremely sincere. Sun replied that the situation in Shanghai is extremely important at the moment, and he should stay in Shanghai for the time being. After talking for 20 minutes, Sun shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's Conversation Wang released a conversation yesterday,</p>
<p>asking whether there were many people outside who said that the government's convocation of the National Crisis Conference was just to shirk the responsibility for peace and war onto the people of the National Crisis Conference, and whether there was really such an intention. He replied that most knowledgeable people have understood the reasons for Japan's invasion, which were caused by the world situation and the Pacific problem. Now that the Kuomintang is in power, the Kuomintang is of course duty-bound to pay for this serious problem. We certainly dare not say that the Kuomintang can definitely solve this problem and achieve a satisfactory result, but since September 18th of last year to today, the Kuomintang government has resolutely refused to sign treaties that would cede power and humiliate the country, and has endured all kinds of sacrifices. I think this spirit is by no means comparable to Yuan Shikai's lightly signing the Twenty-One Demands, and this spirit should be deeply recognized by all citizens. From then on, whether it is peace or war, the Kuomintang government will definitely take responsibility. On the one hand, it deeply desires to gain the understanding and support of people from all walks of life, and on the other hand, it has no intention of shirking responsibility to others. He also asked whether some people said that the government was preparing to propose various measures to increase the burden on the people at the National Crisis Conference, which led some members of the National Crisis Conference to hesitate. He replied that he dared to say responsibly that the government had absolutely no intention of doing so, and that people who said this simply did not understand the nature of the National Crisis Conference. It must be known that the members of the National Crisis Conference are appointed by the government, not elected by the people. The government has absolutely no reason to make the people who are appointed to shoulder any responsibility. He asked whether the gentleman's conversation yesterday about the transition from tutelage to constitutional government required time and conditions, which inevitably made people suspect that the government would take this opportunity to prolong the time of tutelage. He replied that in the past few years, during the period of tutelage, the government has not completed many of the preparations that should have been made to promote constitutional government. Although the government can have reasons to explain, the government cannot fail to admit that the preparations have been slow. However, the government must not make constitutional government indefinitely because of slow preparations. I dare to say responsibly that the government's determination is to shorten the period of tutelage, to speed up the success of the conditions that should be prepared, and to realize constitutional government as soon as possible. In short, what the government hopes for and strives to realize is a true constitutional government, not a constitutional government that existed in name only before the twelfth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Return to Nanjing by Plane Wang and his wife and secretary</p>
<p>took a car from Wanci to Hongqiao Airport at about 1:00 PM yesterday. At 1:30 PM, they took a China National Aviation Corporation plane back to Nanjing. Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Vice Minister Guo Taiqi both went to see them off.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Put Up Slogans on the 3rd</h3>
<p>Police Accuse Them of Sabotaging Peace</p>
<p>The Dami Evening News reported that this morning (4th), the Shanghai Municipal Council police arrested three Japanese people because they posted slogans on telephone poles and other prominent places in Hongkou, including words such as "Please the Chinese people oppose the warlords" and "Insist that no troops be stationed in Shanghai forever." After the three Japanese people were escorted to the police station, they were charged with acts of sabotage of peace and were transferred to the Japanese Consulate for handling. According to the Japanese in the police station, the slogans were posted at the request of the Japanese secretary of the Great American Yarn Factory.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Complains of Post-War Suffering</h3>
<p>Hope All Industries Understand Each Other</p>
<p>Members' Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Cancel Inter-Bank Transfers First</p>
<p>Since the shops in this city have been defending themselves and closed down since January 29th, they have only reluctantly reopened on April 1st for a period of sixty-three days. The direct and indirect losses suffered are self-evident. How should merchants promote their original spirit of mutual assistance and seek the restoration of the inherent functions of various industries in the future business situation? A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited the committee members of the Money Industry Association yesterday. They were kind enough to inform them in detail about the Money Industry's experience in dealing with the market situation, which was half-dead and half-alive for 63 days, the suffering suffered by the Money Industry, and the considerable understanding and maintenance that various industries should have of the Money Industry in the future. The Money Industry accounts for the financial center. After January 29th, observing the situation, it was difficult to stop for a long time, so it resumed business first on February 4th in great difficulty, so as to assist the turnover of the people's livelihood and maintain the safety and tranquility of the rear of the military. In the midst of the war, it took great pains. The daily market was open as usual, and receipts and payments were handled without interruption. On the one hand, a special committee for the custody of the property of the same industry was organized to directly assist the turnover of the same industry and indirectly assist the safety of various industries. This is the experience in dealing with the situation at that time, which is also commonly seen by all sectors. This war occurred three days before the scheduled end of the Eastern Period (end of January). It was an important period for the return of funds from current account households and customers. The sudden closure of the market had a great impact. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately decided to postpone the end of February to the end of the term, and then decided to extend the limit to the end of May, because at that time, traffic was blocked and there were indeed difficulties, but it was not known that the Money Industry's payment of various funds had never been delayed. However, the receipt and payment were not easy to offset, resulting in high premium prices, sharp increases in interest rates, and extremely high clearing fees. Furthermore, in order to prevent a major financial panic in the city, the banks stored large amounts of funds, as much as 20 to 30 million. The hidden losses among them are difficult to calculate completely. This is the situation in which the end of the term was repeatedly postponed. The painful situation is also well known and understood by all sectors. The various industries are as dependent on the Money Industry as lips and teeth. The only source of funds for the Money Industry is deposits, and considerable interest should be paid to depositors. Therefore, considerable interest should also be obtained from loans to various industries to offset the payment. However, the Money Industry has had to pay interest on deposits during the postponement of the term and during the intense war period, but has not received interest on the debts owed to it. It has suffered another layer of pain in these two months. It is sincerely hoped that various industries with considerable ability will plan to reopen their business as soon as possible and expand their original business in order to recover. If they continue to wait and see, it will not only be useless to them, but also there is a day when the lips are gone and the teeth are cold. Moreover, the general assembly of members was held in the public hall yesterday, and it was decided to cancel inter-bank transfers of silver dollars first. As for inter-bank transfers of taels of silver, it was a last resort measure to prevent the outflow of cash at that time, but for the payment of essential living expenses, even if current account holders came to handle cash during the intense shelling before, they could still be accommodated and were never strictly rejected. It has been stipulated in the temporary measures for the reopening of the Money Industry that the cancellation of inter-bank transfers of taels of silver is not far away. Finance is valuable in activity, and there must be no outflow without inflow, and no payment without receipt. Therefore, it is believed that various industries should have considerable understanding and considerable maintenance of each other, so that there is a prospect of restoring the inherent functions of commerce.</p>
<h3>Li Guojie Went to the Bureau Yesterday Morning to Take Office</h3>
<p>Supervisor Chen Did Not Arrive Due to Illness</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau was instructed by the Ministry of Communications to implement reorganization and reorganize its business. Li Guojie, the current chairman of the bureau, was appointed as the general manager, and Chen Fumu, the vice minister of communications, was appointed as the supervisor. Li went to the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday to take office and handle takeover matters. He also gave a speech to the bureau's staff at the bureau's weekly memorial service in the morning and announced the new members of each department. Supervisor Chen Fumu is still staying in Beijing for treatment due to illness and has not yet arrived at the bureau. Therefore, ceremonies such as the inauguration oath will have to wait until Supervisor Chen arrives in Shanghai before they can be held at the same time. Commissioner Guo telegraphed Beijing yesterday to report his resignation. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Commemorative Week Speech Upon Taking Office</h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the newly appointed General Manager, Li Guojie, arrived at the bureau. He first went to the board of directors' rest area for a brief moment. Meanwhile, the General Affairs Section notified all office staff of all departments to gather in the auditorium. At 10:30 AM, General Manager Li attended the commemorative week event. All staff members bowed to Li to welcome the new general manager taking office. The order of events was as follows: singing the party anthem, reading the will, observing three minutes of silence, and then General Manager Li reporting on his appointment and the process by which he felt he could not decline. He also stated that during this time of national crisis, which is also a difficult time for the bureau, his talent and ability are limited, and he relies on the cooperation and collaboration of all colleagues to fulfill their duties so that the bureau's affairs can move towards a stable position. He further encouraged the staff to work hard for the public good.</p>
<h3>New General Manager's Address</h3>
<p>After taking office, General Manager Li went to the former general office on the second floor to work and received the handover from various departments. At that time, he also issued an address to all employees of the bureau, stating briefly: This reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is adopting a policy of austerity. According to the order of the Ministry of Communications, I was appointed as the general manager. My talent and ability are weak. Under the current situation of the bureau, and when the market and finance are extremely tight, I dared not rashly accept the position. However, my relationship with the bureau is too deep, and I bear a double responsibility. For the sake of the nation's shipping rights and the interests of the shareholders, I felt that there was no way to decline. After careful consideration, I had no choice but to勉力 (make an effort) assume the position. Fortunately, Vice Minister Chen also serves as supervisor. As the manager, I will consult him on matters. In the future, personnel will be employed to ensure that everyone does their best, and funds will be used to ensure that everything is used properly. No useless people will be employed, and no useless money will be spent. As for business plans, on the one hand, we will increase revenue, and on the other hand, we will reduce expenditure. The general hope is that business income can first offset expenses, so that we can establish a firm foothold and gradually develop. The debts we owe should be cleared up in order to restore our reputation. As long as I am in office for one day, I will do my best for one day. I dare not consider praise or blame, benefit or harm. I especially hope that all colleagues will cooperate and work together. Then, the bureau may not be difficult to revive.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Staff in Various Departments</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the new general manager announced the list of cadre staff in various departments. The list is recorded as follows: Secretariat: Appointed Secretaries Cai Chengzhi, Jin Xueteng, and Wang Yunzhang.

Xie Tiebo was appointed as the manager of the Shantou branch. Yesterday, various departments were already in the process of handover procedures.</p>
<h3>Dock Workers and Others Offer Congratulations</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's No. 5 dock workers' union sent representatives with a letter to offer congratulations yesterday. The letter stated, "We respectfully inform you that since the reorganization of our bureau to date, more than four years have passed, but because of the use of unsuitable talent, little success has been achieved. Now, fortunately, Your Excellency the General Manager has assumed this difficult task, serving as both director and general manager. You are experienced and skilled, and the future prosperity of the business can be predicted. We have specially dispatched Zhang Guiqing, Shi Hongzhang, Xue Yin, Fu Zhiyang, and Lu Jiaping as five representatives to offer congratulations and listen to the plans for the new administration. We hope to be granted an audience."</p>
<h3>Guo Waifeng Reports Handover</h3>
<p>Former Commissioner of the Bureau</p>
<p>Guo Waifeng telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Communications: Regarding the instruction No. 674 of the Ministry of Communications, Vice Minister Chen Fumu is hereby appointed as the supervisor of the bureau, and Li Guojie is hereby appointed as the general manager of the bureau. You are ordered to transfer the bureau to the general manager for clear acceptance and report accordingly. Upon receiving this, General Manager Li arrived at the bureau today to take office. The commissioner has complied and prepared a list of all items to be handed over and handed them over one by one. This is respectfully telegraphed for the record. Guo Waifeng, former commissioner of the General Management Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, respectfully kowtows."</p>

<h3>Director Mai Again Resigns from All Concurrent Positions</h3>
<p>Mai Chaochu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, submitted a document to Mayor Wu, stating: "Regarding the matter of resignation, this director is humble and mediocre and has been erroneously recommended. Since taking office, I have encountered the Japanese invasion and unrest throughout Shanghai. My personal views are not compatible with the environment. I have once submitted a request to resign, but I was kindly advised by Your Excellency and encouraged to endure the national crisis, so I have remained in my post to this day. However, this director is inherently mediocre and will ultimately be unable to meet public expectations. My stubborn views, especially given the current situation, are greatly contrary to my wishes. After careful consideration, rather than delaying and making mistakes in the future, it is better to sincerely resign today. Therefore, I respectfully request Your Excellency to examine and approve my resignation from the concurrent positions of Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs and member of the Warehouse Fund Raising Committee, and to appoint someone to replace me as soon as possible to maintain the bureau's affairs. I also request instructions to comply. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu by Mai Chaochu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs."</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Requests National Government to Establish Provisional Municipal Assembly</h3>
<p>Our city occupies an important position, and municipal affairs are complex. All facilities rely on the cooperation of local people. When the municipal government was established, there was once an organization of the municipal council. The National Government also promulgated the Municipal Organization Law the year before last, which also has provisions for organizing the municipal assembly. However, its establishment should be after the division of districts, neighborhoods, and communities and the completion of popular elections. It is understood that Mayor Wu, in view of the special circumstances of our city, believes that all municipal administration should be carried out jointly with local people, and local autonomy should be realized as soon as possible. Therefore, he believes that it is necessary to organize the municipal assembly as soon as possible. However, before the organizational rules of the municipal assembly are promulgated, it is proposed to first establish a provisional municipal assembly and appoint local people with experience and knowledge as councilors to gather ideas and benefit from each other, and that everything will be easily accomplished with concerted efforts. The organizational regulations have already been drafted and sent to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Chinese Children's Welfare Association Holds Children's Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th) was Chinese Children's Day. The Shanghai Children's Welfare Education Institute and the Shanghai Battlefield Orphans and Orphan Girls Shelter, affiliated with the Children's Welfare Association, held a Children's Day commemoration at Chen's Garden on Yaozhu Road, starting at 3:00 PM. Those who attended included Hu Xuanming, Luo Yunyan, Wu Weide, Zhang Yueru, Chen Zhengfan, Wang Zhian, Pan Shilin, Huang Zhenyong, Ms. Hu Zhou Shujing, Ms. Hu Zhou Shu'an, Ms. Xu Yunru, Ms. Hu Yuanzhou, Ms. Cao Fengxiang, Ms. Zhu Hanwen, and more than 300 students.

Also, at the beginning of the meeting, a kite was released, with the words "April 4th Children's Day Commemoration" and "Children's Future is Limitless" attached, and a blue sky and white sun flag was tied to the tail, flying in the sky, which was very eye-catching. The Children's Welfare Association also held a ten-minute radio broadcast lecture at the International Radio Station last night, discussing the meaning and importance of Children's Day. It was originally scheduled for Mr. Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee, to give the speech, but because Mr. Kong rushed to Luoyang to attend the National Crisis Conference, it was changed to a speech by Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education.</p>
<h3>All Circles Adore Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>Recognize Monthly Donations to Support Surviving Families</p>
<p>During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, our frontline soldiers bravely defended themselves and won glory for the nation. All circles in the city, in addition to mourning the fallen soldiers who defended the country, are concerned about the upbringing of their surviving families. Therefore, the Association for the Support of Surviving Families of Fallen Soldiers Who Defended the Country was organized to deliberate as a whole, so that they could support the living and comfort the dead. It is reported that fellow citizens Huang Yunquan and Zhou Qingzhao, inspired by the bravery of Chief of Staff Teng Jiushou and the soldiers who defended the country and sacrificed their lives, and saddened by the situation of their surviving families, resolutely entrusted Mr. Yuan Yiyun of the Broadway Company to donate 10 yuan per month to the association for a period of six months. Half of the donation, 5 yuan, was specifically designated for the surviving family of Martyr Teng for the March donation. It has already been sent by a member of the association to Mrs. Yang, the wife of Teng, at the Malang North Apartment for her use. People like Huang and Zhou can be said to be enthusiastic about the national crisis.</p>
<h3>Relief Work</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association New Staff Shen Siliang as Vice President</h3>

<p>Competitions to Begin on June 15</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association held its annual meeting at the Western YMCA yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. More than 20 representatives from various teams attended.

<p>Political Influence Due to political relations in the autumn of last year, lawn tennis was greatly affected. The top Chinese and Japanese players had to cancel the competition. In the advanced singles, Japanese player Hyosuke, withdrew automatically in the rematch. Otherwise, the battle between Qiu Lin and Hyosuke would have caused a sensation, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Weather Conditions The weather was not good last year. The competition was postponed due to rain several times. In the A and B group leagues, there were even several games that were not completed because of this. Fortunately, it was not related to the championship, so it has been decided to start one month earlier this year.</p>
<p>Economic Situation Last year's economic situation of the association was one of the most promising. Mrs. Hardy came to Shanghai and sold tickets in advance, selling a total of 2,806 yuan. Unfortunately, Mrs. Hardy was unable to attend due to illness, and the full amount was returned. Ordinary income was more than 257 yuan last year. Compared with the 33 yuan that had to be subsidized in 1930, there has been a great improvement, which also shows the increasing interest of the audience. However, the new construction of the large stadium cost more than 3,400 yuan. As for the competition results of the previous session, they have been seen in yesterday's newspaper.</p>

<h3>Declaration of All Workers of Shen Bao</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the journalist's union, labor and management have always been harmonious. It has been found that this time the Shanghai Times due to the printing of the Greater Evening News, caused a misunderstanding between the two parties, but the newspaper's management took the opportunity to close the factory and falsely accused our workers of striking. On the other hand, they are employing new workers, which clearly shows that the newspaper's management has ulterior motives and wants to destroy our workers' organization. The workers of our newspaper are united in the same boat. In addition to requesting the union to implement its original intention and persevere to the end, the workers of our newspaper pledge to be the backing. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Declaration of All Workers of Xinwen Bao</h3>
<p>Dear compatriots, this time the management of the Shanghai Times closed the factory for no reason on the 2nd of this month and drove all the workers of the newspaper out of the factory. Upon hearing this, all the workers of this newspaper were filled with outrage. The newspaper's oppression of workers has been going on for more than a day or two, and the workers have been instructed by the union to be united in the face of the national crisis, and have always sought compromise. All the various conditions of the newspaper have been accepted. Unexpectedly, the newspaper took this as an opportunity to be deceived, and took the opportunity of the workers' families avoiding disaster to carry out Japanese-style aggression. Suddenly, on the 2nd of this month, they insulted and beat workers on the grounds of forcing the printing of the Greater Evening News. At the same time, they falsely accused the executive committee members of being reactionaries, and threatened the workers of the newspaper to withdraw from the journalist's union. Their insidious methods were used to the extreme. Fortunately, the workers of the newspaper understood the general righteousness and were unwilling to be deceived by them. Their conspiracy failed, and they intensified their efforts, proposing harsh conditions, while closing the factory and driving out all the workers. The workers of the newspaper had no choice but to appeal to the journalist's union for help. The union sent people to negotiate several times, but the newspaper imitated Japan, pretending to agree but actually disagreeing, with no sincerity. And suddenly recruited non-members to work at the newspaper. All the workers of this newspaper saw this situation. Under the clear sky and white sun, they dared to destroy the workers' movement in this way. This is intolerable. Therefore, all the workers of this newspaper now specifically request the journalist's union to negotiate with the Shanghai Times as soon as possible with the minimum of two requirements, and must achieve the goal: (1) Open the factory and restore the original state before April 2. (2) The Shanghai Times must apologize to the insulted workers and the newspaper committee in the newspaper. If they still insist on their own way and disregard justice, all the workers of this newspaper recognize the newspaper as a public enemy that destroys the unity of the journalist's union. All the workers of this newspaper pledge to fight them to the end, preferring to be shattered jade rather than complete tile. This is our declaration, we hope for your public judgment. All the workers of Xinwen Bao respectfully.</p>
<h3>Declaration of All Workers of Shibao</h3>
<p>Declaration of all workers of the Shanghai Times to aid the workers of the Shanghai Times, stating that the Shanghai Times capitalists, due to forcing the workers of the newspaper to print the Greater Evening News, caused a misunderstanding with the workers of the newspaper, but the authorities of the newspaper disregarded right and wrong and drove all the workers of the newspaper out of the newspaper. This action clearly intends to destroy our entire journalist's union. The workers of our newspaper, with their shared destiny, are determined to provide practical assistance. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3>Grand Concert at the New Guang Theater</h3>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao: I have recently read the column "Shen Su Steamer Robbed" on page five of the second section of your newspaper on the 4th of this month. The article mentions the words "Heng Ren" and "Tong Yuan (i.e., Dai Shengchang) Company." Upon investigation, our bureau is not Dai Shengchang, nor does it have the Heng Ren steamer operating on the Shen Su route. Our general bureau is located at 51 Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road in this city. Our business routes are all in the Jiaxing and Huzhou areas of Zhejiang Province. The Heng Ren steamer, I hear, belongs to the Yuantong Shipping Company on North Su Road in this city. I believe your newspaper's inquiry was inaccurate. In order to eliminate misunderstandings from all circles, I am writing this letter to request a correction. I pray for your investigation. With best wishes for your well-being, The Yuan Shipping General Bureau, April 4, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Xia Douyin Discusses Ways to Reorganize Finance</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Xia Douyin said that the financial situation in Hubei is difficult. The way to reorganize is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Increasing revenue requires familiarity with the local interests and not violating the central government's laws in order to take from the local area and use it for the local area. Reducing expenditure requires merging redundant agencies, reducing redundant staff, and paying attention to promoting interests and eliminating abuses. If properly handled, education, construction, and water conservancy will all have a way to follow. As the governor of the province, I will not take into account the difficulties and will seek solutions from the hardships, work hard on integrity, and seek understanding with sincerity. I hope that the people of the province will urge me to work together to overcome this difficulty. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of State's Mission to Geneva</h3>
<p>Besides Attending Disarmament Conference Work</p>
<p>Mediating the Far East Problem is Also the Main Reason</p>
<p>This Trip is of the Same Importance as Wilson's Trip to the Paris Peace Conference</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 3rd – The announcement that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson is personally coming to Geneva to assist in the disarmament process has been warmly welcomed here. Key figures in the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations Council generally believe that Mr. Stimson's arrival is not only intended to accelerate the work of the Disarmament Conference and prepare for the Lausanne Conference, but also to seek to facilitate the mediation of disputes in the three eastern provinces. Some quarters, however, believe that the Manchurian issue is in fact the main reason for Mr. Stimson's trip. According to secret sources, Stimson is eager to obtain the support of Britain and France for the U.S. stance on Manchuria, so as to present a unified attitude to Japan. Therefore, U.S. officials stationed abroad generally expect that Mr. Stimson's trip will be one of the most important events since President Wilson went to Europe to attend the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd – A dispatch from Washington states that although it is said that Secretary of State Stimson's trip to Europe is only related to the work of the Disarmament Conference, according to the New York Times' Washington interview, both diplomatic and political circles in the U.S. capital believe that Stimson will also discuss reparations and war debts. It is also heard that Stimson hopes to have the opportunity in Geneva to express his views on the Far East issue. The Baltimore Sun's Washington special dispatch predicts that Stimson's trip will bring about important changes in the arms reduction process, particularly in the reduction of tanks, artillery, and submarines.</p>
<h3>Meeting of British and French Authorities</h3>
<p>The Two Countries Express Sincere Cooperation</p>
<p>To Seek Improvement of the Overall European Economy</p>
<p>British-French Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd – Today, French Premier Tardieu, accompanied by Finance Minister Flandin, arrived here to begin discussing the European economic situation with British authorities. An important meeting with Germany and Italy will be agreed upon within the week. Tardieu arrived at Victoria Station at 4:13 PM, where British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon welcomed him at the station. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Tardieu traveled by car to the French Embassy, and at 6:00 PM, visited MacDonald at the Prime Minister's official residence, engaging in conversation for one hour and fifteen minutes. The French Premier then made a statement to reporters, saying that he was very pleased to resume negotiations with his friend MacDonald. What needs to be considered now is the European dilemma. The responsibility of the British and French governments lies in addressing this dilemma from the perspective of unity. Britain and France are not only linked by a precious friendship, but also bound by a common political and moral responsibility. This responsibility arises from the shared tools possessed by the two countries and their similar aspirations for an era of peace and justice. This is the spirit in which Britain and France have decided to meet. He believes that this is also the spirit of the four-nation conference on Wednesday. Britain and France have the same goals and both want to maintain the normal state of life in all countries, so they must put their aspirations into practice. Britain and France have indeed accomplished more difficult tasks in the past, and so on. British Prime Minister MacDonald told Reuters tonight that the London conference has two main objectives: unified cooperation and helping Europe. Tomorrow's British-French meeting will conduct a general study of the overall European situation, starting with the Danube River issue. As for agreements, they must be made at the four-nation conference. The four-nation conference begins on Wednesday and is not limited to the Danube situation. Participants are free to express their opinions without any constraints. European countries should cooperate to cope with the current difficult problems affecting the world, especially Europe. Some people may have doubts about the British-French meeting, but in fact, such doubts are unfounded. The British government is sincere and selfless, and wants to work with other countries to formulate a policy aimed at European peace and welfare. The sole purpose of the initiators of this conference is to establish an agreement that is in line with the interests and happiness of the countries concerned. Tonight, a banquet was held at the French Embassy, with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon in attendance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Vienna, today Italian official circles announced that Foreign Minister Grandi will participate in the London four-nation conference. It is understood that what the four-nation conference will discuss is the economic situation in Central and Eastern Europe. The manufacturing industries of Austria and Czechoslovakia have been destroyed by the current market situation, while Hungary,</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, and Romania have also been greatly affected because they cannot profit from selling food, timber, and oil.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – This morning, the British and French leaders held a meeting in the British Cabinet Room to discuss the disturbing situation in Southeast Europe. British Prime Minister MacDonald chaired the meeting, with British Foreign Secretary Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and Minister of Commerce Runciman attending on the British side, and French Premier Tardieu and Finance Minister Flandin attending on the French side. Each member brought experts with them. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of friendliness and trust. It is heard that the discussion covered a wide range of issues, including international debt. The French officials were deeply concerned about the dangers to the rest of Europe and the world caused by the poor production in Southeast Europe and the low prices, and acknowledged that its impact was not limited to Southeast Europe. After the meeting, a formal banquet was held at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 3rd – The British and French leaders will hold a full-day meeting tomorrow. The first meeting will exchange views on preliminary issues. Tardieu and Flandin will represent France, while MacDonald, Simon, and Chamberlain will represent Britain. Experts from both countries will also attend. Based on the sentiments expressed during the Downing Street talks last night, it seems that the results of tomorrow's study of preliminary issues will definitely benefit the joint cause that urgently needs to be realized.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th – After receiving reliable statements from London, the German people have reduced their concerns that the French Premier's visit to Britain will induce the British Prime Minister to agree to measures that are greatly detrimental to Germany. It is heard that the British government has decided not to agree with France's attitude on the Danube River and reparations issues under any circumstances. A Berlin newspaper's dispatch from London stated that the London conference may not have practical results, and the British government will resolutely oppose any conspiracy that is detrimental to the participation of Germany and Italy in the Danube River conference.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Discusses Inevitability of U.S.-Japan War</h3>
<p>Russia and the U.S. Should Cooperate Urgently</p>
<p>To Curb Japanese Aggression in Asia</p>
<p>Kobe and New Japan Newspaper carried Moscow Dispatch that the Central Military People's Committee organ newspaper Red Star News published a lengthy article on the current situation, saying that the future war between the U.S. and Japan over hegemony in the Pacific is an inevitable fact. The relationship between the U.S. and Japan in the past was already dangerous, and the current dispute is still a war of documents in diplomacy, and demonstrations of propaganda and military exercises in the news, but the future armed conflict is becoming more and more imminent. The editor of the Red Star News also warned the Russian diplomatic authorities, saying that if we want to stop Japan's continental aggression policy in Asia, Russia and the U.S. should cooperate urgently to curb it. Judging from the recent situation, the union of Russia and the U.S. is indeed possible.</p>
<h3>U.S. Pays Attention to Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Recruiting 100,000 Pilots</p>
<p>Preparing to Requisition 1,000 Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Tokyo National News reports that U.S. Republican Senator Hiram Plumb proposed a bill on pilot training to Congress on the 29th of last month. The bill stipulates that 100,000 civilian pilots be trained under the supervision of the Department of the Army, and that the airports in various cities be used as airfields. The Secretary of the Army is now pre-hiring civilian flight instructors, and at the same time, the government is discussing with the army the authority to provide aircraft. Another telegram said that U.S. Secretary of the Navy Adams advised Congress to quickly enact a law that, in the event of a national emergency, the Navy Department should have the authority to requisition merchant ships registered under U.S. law. This</p>
<p>The Navy Department's plan is to use 1,000 merchant ships for naval purposes, and in order to implement this plan, the President should gather a number of merchant ships at designated bases immediately after declaring a national emergency. According to the current report of the Navy Department, the number of ships that can be requisitioned by the Shipping Administration is 443 in service and 234 budgeted for, including 20 built under construction cost financing and the fifth ship built under a specific contract. After the declaration of war, general ships on ordinary transportation routes are also subject to requisition. In this case, the number of ships available to the Navy Department will exceed the number required.</p>
<h3>Investigation Team's Situation from Jingxi</h3>
<p>Appendix: The League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>The League of Nations investigation team, amidst the brilliant lights of welcome arches on both sides of the river, boarded the Longhe ship on April 1st and sailed upstream. Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, and Chu Minyi, among others, personally saw them off onto the ship. The National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also dispatched special commissioners to escort them. The hospitality could be described as grand.</p>
<p>The Longhe is a relatively superior ship on the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the delegation, at a cost of four thousand one hundred and twenty-four yuan, chartered the entire main dining room. The cabins were divided into two levels, with the investigation team and Chinese and Japanese representatives occupying the upper level, and the rest occupying the lower level. However, the number of berths on the upper level was limited, and some Westerners were relegated to the lower level. Due to the perceived hierarchy, there were complaints. In reality, if they had taken just one step further into the common cabins, wouldn't they have felt as if they were in heaven and hell?</p>
<p>Sailing on the Yangtze River, except during the Kuling summer resort season, when the main dining room is full once or twice, it seems that the Longhe has never been so crowded as this time. However, the ship stayed in Nanjing for a day and a half, causing much trouble for other passengers, and the loss of food and accommodation for the comprador needs no further mention.</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day, the ship arrived in Wuhu amidst noisy greetings. Representatives from various local circles, such as Garrison Commander Tan Jingguo, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Jingshi, Executive Committee Member of the Chamber of Commerce Chen Shaotang, reporter Cui Lianggong, and representatives from the Store Employees' Union and the Industrial Union, more than ten people in total, carrying national flags, boarded the ship in single file to express their welcome. However, not only had the investigation team not risen yet, but even the personnel of the delegation had not risen yet. In desperation, Secretary-General Wang Guangqi had to emerge from his bed to receive them, promising to convey their goodwill. They, seeing that the ship was about to depart, did not wait long and left. Wuhu newspapers published very detailed reports on the movements of the investigation team. By about six o'clock, they could be purchased at the pier, demonstrating the progress of the local press in recent years.</p>
<p>After the ship passed Wuhu, the sky was clear and the wind was calm. Some members of the investigation team who had never traveled in China or on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River leaned on the railing, seeing the green willows and colorful flowers on both banks, the fishermen and farmers at play, and the light sails skimming past the ship. They couldn't help but exclaim, "Excellent! This is truly a country blessed by nature!" Although this praise was not artificial, judging from the unfinished tone, it could be followed by a retort: "This is truly a country blessed by nature, but what if no one governs it well?" Sir Lytton, although on the ship, worked tirelessly. All telegrams and gifts received were promptly replied to. The seriousness of the British in handling affairs is evident. The staff of the delegation were also very busy, deliberating on the reception procedures in Hankou, the allocation of berths on the Pingpu special train, and the length of stay in major cities in the north. They sent people ashore along the way to send telegrams to inform and prepare in advance. Due to the limited number of berths on the special train for the investigation team, which was insufficient to allocate, twenty-eight people who were not required to travel with the team will take the Pingpu special express train departing at 7:00 pm on the seventh to go north. The Chinese delegation's trip to the Northeast, according to the League of Nations' resolution, the Japanese seem to have no reason to prevent. However, the number of people is large, and perhaps it needs to be discussed. According to the existing staff of the secretariat, general affairs, reception, editing, and proposal groups, it already exceeds one hundred people. It is feared that it will only be possible to finalize the decision and notify the investigation team after arriving in Beiping.</p>
<p>The luggage of the investigation team and the delegation was entrusted to the China Travel Service for transportation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had sent special commissioners to assist in the care. However, Sir Lytton's white iron box suddenly went missing. In the past, when Lu Zhengxiang went to the Paris Peace Conference, one of his boxes containing important documents disappeared without a trace while passing through Yokohama. Therefore, those who heard this news were all surprised. However, it is still being investigated, and it is hoped that there will be no mistakes. Mr. Wu Xiufeng, a Chinese secretary of the League of Nations, also accompanied the investigation team this time. According to him, the process of the League of Nations handling the Sino-Japanese dispute can be divided into the following three stages. It is quite sufficient for our reference during this investigation period.</p>
<p>First Stage (September 21st to October 8th)</p>
<p>A. China's Indictment to the League of Nations Regarding Japan's Occupation of the Eastern Provinces: When the news of Japan forcibly occupying the Eastern Provinces under the pretext of force came, the whole country was furious. China, based on Article 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, formally requested the Administrative Council of the League of Nations on September 21st, in accordance with the provisions of that article, to 1) immediately take measures to prevent the expansion of the incident in order to maintain peace between China and Japan, 2) restore the situation before September 18th, 3) determine the scope and nature of compensation for China's losses.</p>
<p>B. The First Meeting of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations:</p>
<p>1) The Urgent Order of the Chairman of the Administrative Council: The Japanese troops launched an incident in Shenyang just as the League of Nations General Assembly had not yet ended, and the Administrative Council was convening. Therefore, at the meeting on September 22nd, the Council formally accepted China's indictment against Japan. However, due to the urgency of the situation, after a brief discussion, it was resolved that the Chairman of the Administrative Council, Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux, would send an urgent telegram to both parties to cease military action to prevent the expansion of the incident and facilitate a peaceful resolution, and to negotiate with the Chinese and Japanese representatives on measures to withdraw troops immediately within the scope of the safety of the lives and property of the people of both countries.</p>
<p>In 1925, when Greek troops invaded Bulgarian territory, the Administrative Council also convened an emergency meeting and simultaneously issued a telegram from the Chairman to the troops of both parties, not only ordering them to immediately cease military action but also to immediately return to their own countries. However, this time, for the Eastern Provinces incident, the second item of its emergency resolution, which was to negotiate troop withdrawal measures with the representatives of both parties within the scope of the safety of the lives and property of the people of both countries, and did not dare to invoke the precedent of ordering Japan to withdraw troops immediately, was precisely a manifestation of the League of Nations' weakness and the beginning of our disappointment.</p>
<p>2) The League of Nations' Movement for Cooperation with the United States: The League of Nations, fearing Japan's strength and not daring to order it to withdraw troops immediately, and also wanting to maintain its own face and avoid accusations of cowardice, had to invite the hegemon of the Pacific, the United States, to cooperate. At the same time, 1) because of the importance of American interests in China, various issues concerning the Pacific cannot be resolved without the participation of the United States; 2) because the United States is the initiating country of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Manchurian issue is also directly related to it; 3) because the United States is a leading naval power, and reducing Japan depends on its strength; 4) although the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, it has a great relationship with the development of the League of Nations. If the League of Nations wants to achieve the goal of becoming the highest political organ in the world and maintaining world peace, it cannot do without the assistance of the United States. However, the American people have always adhered to the Monroe Doctrine of non-interference in the politics of other continents. Therefore, although the organization of the League of Nations was initiated by President Wilson, the United States never became a member of the League of Nations. However, the League of Nations has not given up hope for the United States to join, and invites it to participate in every matter. Therefore, all specialized agencies of the League of Nations have American representatives. Japan's occupation of Manchuria by force not only endangers world peace but also endangers American interests. Therefore, the League of Nations is happy to take this opportunity to invite the United States to participate in order to urge it to cooperate with the League of Nations.</p>
<p>When the Administrative Council held its second meeting on September 22nd, British representative Sir Cecil proposed that the progress of the Administrative Council's discussion of the Manchurian issue be temporarily notified to the US government so that the US government could obtain complete information on this issue and know how to adopt the correct attitude. Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa believed that the matter was ordinary, so he did not object.</p>
<p>After this resolution was passed, the US government gave a satisfactory reply to the League of Nations on September 20th, stating that the US government expressed great sympathy for the League of Nations' emergency resolution on the Manchurian case, and had ordered the US ambassadors in Beiping and Tokyo to make similar recommendations to the Chinese and Japanese governments.</p>
<p>3) The Attitudes and Debates of the Chinese and Japanese Sides: China's accusation of Japanese aggression was submitted in writing on September 21st. When the Administrative Council held its second and third meetings on the afternoon of the 22nd, Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji, the ambassador, requested the Administrative Council to immediately take measures to restore the state before September 18th, and to send personnel to investigate the losses and the responsibility for the incident, and said that the Chinese government would adopt a policy of non-resistance to the Eastern Provinces incident and would fully listen to the League of Nations' handling of it. Some critics have accused this kind of diplomacy of relying on the League of Nations. In fact, when the responsibility for the incident is not clear, and there is no preparation for war against Japan, it is not necessarily a bad strategy to temporarily not resist. It can transfer part of the responsibility for protecting China's territorial integrity to the League of Nations, making it unable to shake it off. In other words, using the League of Nations as our vanguard, while we can still make military preparations in the rear. Unfortunately, the League of Nations' vanguard always loses every battle, and we do not think about preparing and continue its policy of non-resistance, which is self-defeating.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa declared that hundreds of thousands of Japanese residents in Manchuria, with property worth 200 million yuan, are all protected by treaties, but in recent years, the Chinese government has arbitrarily trampled on them. This is the long-term cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict. As for the recent unfortunate incident, it was due to the Chinese army blowing up the South Manchurian Railway. Therefore, the fault lies with China and not with Japan. He received a report from his country that the Chinese side had proposed direct negotiations. He firmly believed that only direct negotiations could achieve the goal of a peaceful solution.</p>
<p>When the Administrative Council held its fourth meeting on September 25th, the Japanese government ordered its representative to respond to the urgent telegram of the Chairman of the Administrative Council on September 22nd. Regarding the first item of the telegram, which ordered both parties to cease attacks pending mediation, it stated: "The Japanese government, from beginning to end, has tried its best to prevent the expansion of the incident, except for necessary actions concerning the protection of the lives and property of Japanese people." Regarding the issue of troop withdrawal, it stated: "Japan has now begun to withdraw troops. The complete withdrawal must be conditional on the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents." The Japanese representative also read out the Japanese government's declaration of September 24th, which stated: "Japan has absolutely no territorial ambition in Manchuria. The current conflict was caused by the Chinese army damaging the South Manchurian Railway. Japan has taken this military action for the sake of self-defense." Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji then also read out the National Government's reply to the Chairman of the Administrative Council's urgent telegram, which, in addition to thanking the League of Nations for its mediation, insisted that Japan must withdraw its troops immediately. As for the protection of the lives and property of Japanese residents, China is willing to bear full responsibility. Shi also pointed out that since the reports of both parties on the truth of the incident differ, the fairest way is to ask the League of Nations to send personnel to investigate on the spot. At the same time, he denied that China had proposed direct negotiations.</p>
<p>On the 28th, the fifth meeting was reconvened, mainly to discuss the issue of sending personnel to investigate, and adjourned without result.</p>
<p>4) The Administrative Council's Five-Power Conference: The so-called Five-Power Conference is a secret meeting organized by the representatives of England, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. According to the resolution of September 22nd, in addition to the Administrative Council ordering both parties to cease military action, it also invited the Chairman to negotiate troop withdrawal measures with the representatives of both parties. Therefore, from the 22nd to the 29th, there was no day without a Five-Power Conference being convened. The role of this kind of meeting was to pre-negotiate troop withdrawal measures so that they could be submitted to the Chinese and Japanese representatives for discussion again. The so-called troop withdrawal measures were for the League of Nations to send personnel to investigate the truth on the spot so that they could (A) prove where the responsibility for the incident lies. If the bombing of the South Manchurian Railway was deliberately done by the Japanese army to create an excuse for advancing, then Japan should be responsible for compensating China for the losses suffered. (B) It can prove that the lives and property of Japanese residents had not been harmed by us before the Sino-Japanese conflict occurred. If the Japanese army immediately returns the power to maintain law and order to our country, then our government will be able to provide Japanese residents with effective protection. Therefore, if the above two issues are resolved, then Japan will lose its reason for not being able to withdraw its troops. However, the Japanese representative strongly argued, only saying that the affairs of China and Japan can only be resolved directly by China and Japan. The intervention of the League of Nations will only prolong the time for resolution. Although the Chinese government has declared that it is willing to bear the responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents, in fact, the orders of the Chinese central government cannot reach all provinces. Japan will never be able to believe that a piece of paper can truly protect the safety of Japanese people, so it has to seek self-defense." Therefore, the proposal to send personnel to investigate could not be passed due to the objection of one Japanese representative. As a result, it was only allowed that each country could send its military attachés stationed in China to listen to the news on the spot and report to their respective governments, and then the governments of each country would inform the League of Nations. The Eastern Provinces are our country's territory, and we originally had the right to request the League of Nations to send personnel to investigate alone, but in the end, because the Japanese representative declared that if the League of Nations does not respect Japan's wishes, then Japan will not be responsible for protecting the investigators, the League of Nations could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>5) The Resolution of September 30th: Since the scheduled troop withdrawal and sending personnel to investigate were opposed by Japan, and the conference had to come to a temporary end, the Administrative Council unanimously passed a resolution on September 30th. The general idea of the resolution was: "Based on the Japanese government's declaration that Japan has no territorial ambition in Manchuria, and also based on the Japanese representative's declaration that it intends to completely withdraw its troops outside the South Manchurian Railway zone within the shortest possible period within the scope of the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, and also based on the Chinese representative's declaration that the Chinese government is willing to bear the responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents, it is hereby requested that the governments of China and Japan implement the above declarations and report the news to the Administrative Council at any time. At the same time, the Administrative Council decided to convene a new meeting on October 14th in order to review. However, if it is convened in advance due to special circumstances, this is not the case. Furthermore, if the Chairman of the Administrative Council believes that there is no need to convene the meeting at that time, then the proposal to convene the meeting on October 14th can be cancelled." According to the last paragraph of the resolution, if the Chairman of the Administrative Council believes that there is no need to convene the meeting at that time, the previous proposal can be cancelled. It can be seen that the psychology of various countries at that time was that Japan is a leading world power and has always been trustworthy. Now that the Administrative Council's resolution does not limit the time for troop withdrawal in order to preserve its so-called sacred and inviolable imperial dignity, it is expected that it will be able to withdraw troops automatically before October 14th to avoid breaking the Covenant of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese dispute occurred at a time when our country was elected as a member of the Administrative Council, and our government had appointed Ambassador Shi Zhaoji as its representative, which was truly fortunate. Ambassador Shi's attitude was peaceful, his propositions were strong, and his wording was appropriate, which won the respect of people from all countries. Compared to the Japanese representative's frenzied puffing on cigars, his cold composure, and his speech spitting out only one word at a time, making it unbearable for people to endure for long, there was a world of difference. As for the resolution of September 30th, not only did it not dare to limit the time for troop withdrawal, but even sending personnel to investigate was abandoned due to Japanese opposition, which was truly a manifestation of the League of Nations' fear and incompetence. As for our country's diplomacy, although it cannot be said to be successful, it cannot be said to be a failure either, because the reason why the Eastern Provinces have not been able to see the light of day again is because our internal political disputes have not stopped, and the powers have not been able to make the world's countries confront Japan and put Japan in an isolated position.

<h3>Opening the Market with Pain</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>All sectors in Shanghai, since the market strike, until April 1st, began to resume business with pain. In these two months, all industries stagnated, and the local area was devastated. The direct and indirect losses are almost impossible to calculate. Residents in the war zone have already lost their homes and property. Shops outside the war zone have closed down and gone bankrupt due to the death or flight of customers. There is no trace of people to be found. The loans extended are difficult to collect for the time being. Even if they still exist, all industries have been completely destroyed. Most of them are no longer able to. Otherwise, old debts are not cleared, and new goods are difficult to import. Even if the market opens, it may not be easy to continue operating. In addition, transportation has not yet been restored, and many foreign ports do not understand the true situation in Shanghai. Rumors are spreading, making people hesitant to move forward. Although resuming business with pain, the future is not promising.</p>
<p>Recalling the tragic situation in Tokyo after the great earthquake in Japan is almost the same as now. However, because they received assistance from the government and understanding from all parties, coupled with commercial ethics and credit, they were able to overcome the difficult hurdle of crisis with a spirit of mutual assistance. Therefore, in a few years, they were able to restore the prosperity of the market. This time, we have suffered sacrifices for resisting foreign aggression, which is very different from the nature of natural disasters. Therefore, all parties must work together to overcome the difficulties and mediate with each other. Do not be too coercive to the affected shops or customers, causing mutual friction, and making the aggressors laugh.</p>
<p>Now, all local sectors are doing their best to discuss post-disaster relief measures. The banking industry is also taking into account the overall situation and finding ways to accommodate. Even if the old appearance cannot be restored for a while, the market can be maintained and survive. However, there is one point that I would like to ask all parties to pay special attention to. We have suffered this unprecedented catastrophe, and everyone certainly has a deep and unforgettable impression in their minds. I heard that recently our painful goods are about to come in a steady stream. If we do not wake up a little, then it will be extremely bad.</p>
<h3>A Record of Shi Ying's Repair of Puji Taoist Temple</h3>
<p>— Fu Ran</p>
<p>More than two li west of Baimajian Town outside Changmen, Wu County, there is a mountain named Hejiu Ridge. It is a small mountain. There is a Puji Taoist Temple on it. The scenery is excellent and suitable for recuperation. However, the temple is dilapidated, and few people have lived there for a long time. However, in December, it was suddenly renovated. Upon investigation, it was learned that it was repaired by Shi Ying. After being forced to confess by Zhejiang Chairman Zhang Nanxian, Ying resigned as the Director of the Construction Department. Feeling the difficulty of the world situation and the treacherousness of people's hearts, he leisurely retired to live there. All repairs were paid out of his own pocket. There are a total of six people in the temple. Two are responsible for sweeping, cooking, and opening and closing doors. They are also from his hometown. One is an old Taoist priest who talks to Ying all day long. Ying is also dressed as a Taoist priest. Two are his sons who came last month. They are taught by their father. When his sons came, all the luggage was carried up the mountain by the village women, who were paid four hundred cash. In fact, half of that would have been enough. Ying was furious when he learned about it, scolding them for being muddle-headed, as he hated their deliberately showing off. From this, it can be seen that he is strict. When Ying came, he brought very little luggage. In addition to bedding, there was only a box of books. He did not lose his true colors as a scholar. He is also quite kind to people. A mailbox has been set up in this town since last winter. However, due to its remote location, there are very few letters. There are only three or four letters a day. After Ying came, it suddenly increased. He personally occupies several pieces every day, and postage stamps are selling well because of this. A smile.</p>
<h3>I Think</h3>
<p>— Ye Shenbao</p>
<p>I want to take an airship and fly over the top of the Himalayas to see the world fighting for power and profit, seeking fields and asking about wells, like going mad, like being drunk. At this time, if I give loyal advice, I am still afraid that my words will be isolated and weak and no one will listen. How can I eliminate the prejudice of selfishness and self-interest? Cook it into fragrant tea to relieve worries. Ask Cloud Lady to drive the plane for me, and ask the Wind God to lead the way. Please ask the Rain Master to sprinkle it on the legal circle so that people will be like being irrigated with ambrosia, each awakened, each clear-headed. (Thank you)</p>

<h3>A Couple Living Between Military and Civilian Life (25)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Marriage Contract Forces People to Hesitate, Disturbing Themselves; Banditry Plunders the Land, and the Coward Begins to Re-Explore</p>
<p>It is said that Li Wenxia picked up that golden box and waved it in front of An Yutian's eyes, asking in a stern voice what this was. An Yutian seemed to hear a loud thunder in the clear sky, so frightened that he stood still on the side, only peeking. Li Wenxia's iron-blue face with anger, and lowering his head to submit to Guan口问心, so bitterly thinking about how to guide. This is really terrible. I was caught in this handle for no reason. How can I explain this? Clearly, I recognize that this box is Liang Xiaoyun's. It was accidentally dropped here just now. It must have been after she finished washing up and dressing up, and then suddenly said a few words with me in laughter, and then forgot to take it away. I was also careless for a while, only urging the waiter to clean up the bowls, but I did not check this small matter. However, for Li Wenxia, I really cannot tell the truth directly. After being embarrassed for a while, I gradually thought of a strategy to prevaricate. But scratching his head and cheeks, his movements finally revealed that he was not very natural, only deliberately oh oh answered repeatedly. Yes, I remembered. This must be something from my classmate just now. He was eager to go to the movies. He walked in a hurry and lost it here. Now that you accidentally picked it up, not only are you very strange, but I am also surprised. After thinking about it for a while, I remembered it. You must understand that I have never liked using this kind of female cosmetics. Li Jianxia still didn't believe it and retorted angrily. Nonsense. Didn't you just say it was a male classmate? How could he use women's things? An Yutian blushed and hurriedly argued. You don't understand the personality of my male classmate. He is not as honest as I am. He likes to make friends with girlfriends and often likes to steal small things that girlfriends carry with them. Today, it must be after eating with me here. He secretly took out his stolen little box, washed his face, and put a lot of powder on his face, dressing up like an actress singing a 花旦, preparing to go to the movie theater to meet some girlfriend. I was so bored that I didn't pay attention to these actions of him. I didn't expect it to cause you a suspicion. After saying that, he saw that the waiter had brewed a pot of hot tea, so he poured a cup and handed it to Li Wenxia. He also said. Please drink tea. Don't commit this kind of meaningless suspicion again. Li Wenxia took the teacup and slowly drank a few sips. Thinking that his defense was still reasonable, but there was still some uneasiness in the space, he said lightly. Maybe that's the truth. I guess you may not be so heartless. At the time of family ruin, you still recruit some cheap women from Changmen to come to the apartment for secret pleasure. But I still have to say one more thing. Even if this thing is your shameless male classmate, you have to associate with this kind of friend less in the future. Those who are near Zhu are red. Those who are near ink are black. I'm afraid he will lure you into muddy waters together. An Yutian heard that his words were still so sharp, so he pretended to sigh for a long time. You are too suspicious. How can I be such an ungraspable person? It's just that you always don't believe me, but it really makes me sad. After saying that, he walked to the front of the bed and lay down horizontally. He was still sighing and sighing non-stop.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Rapid Progress</h3>
<p>Breaking Through the 700 Taels Barrier</p>
<p>Soaring 14.5 Taels Yesterday, the trend of the gold market on the 4th was sharp, buyers were excited, and progress was rapid. The fluctuation throughout the day was only around two or three taels, but the total difference between high and low reached 14 taels. Finally, it surged 14 or 15 taels. Initially, the silver price reported a drop. Although silver bars showed an increase, it was unmoved, and opened high, breaking through 690 taels. As the exchange rate tightened, and it was heard that a certain bank continued to purchase spot goods, the price subsequently continued to rise. Afterwards, the buying interest in the market became more intense, and the exchange rates of both British and American currencies were particularly good. All firms concluded that the market situation was soaring into the clouds, and it had already exceeded the 700 taels barrier. People were firmly bullish. The past situation of the market before and after is recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened high early in the morning. When the market opened in early May, it increased by 4.5 taels, reaching 691 taels. Silver bars rose by one-sixteenth the day before yesterday. However, the silver price fell by one-eighth. Another 0.05 taels were added. However, as Heng Yu, Run Chang, Yu, etc. sold, the price fell back two or three taels. However, in an instant, there was a difference of around two taels. At 9:10, it was 87.5 taels. The Bank of Japan conducted spot and forward trades of British gold at 1.8625, and this month's US dollar at 32.375 yuan. Before long, retail customers came in.

Zifeng, Yongheng, Yu, Yuancheng, Yongtong, Fengheng, etc. competed to enter, and it was rumored that a certain bank absorbed another 280,000 taels of cash. Coupled with the strength of the US dollar, which was close to 32.5 yuan, it was still difficult to obtain, and the price jumped six or seven taels. However, there was more than one tael of head spread, and until 11:30, it was 97.5 taels. In an instant, there were two taels of glory and disgrace due to differences in delivery. At 11:40, the trend declined, and many parties sold off. Until the noon close at 94.8 taels, this month's US dollar could be closed at 31.25. The listed price was changed to 759 taels, totaling 68 to 70 taels, and the noon close was 63.4 taels.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, buying interest was high. The market opened at 94.5 taels in the afternoon, and soon increased to 96.5 taels. There seemed to be many buyers but no large tickets. Then it went back one and a half taels to 95 taels. At 2:30, it was suddenly heard that a certain bank had purchased cash again, and the US dollar was particularly tight, with a deal at 3.75. After that, 31.25 was about to close, and Heng Yu and others competed to enter, and the gold price rose to 699.8 taels (it had been called for 700 taels). Later, due to retail sales, it was about 2.3 points lower, at 7.8 taels. Subsequently, Da Xing Yong and others dragged in a lot of goods on the market. The US dollar was close to 32 yuan, and May was 32.0625 yuan. The market situation was extremely sharp, until 3:15, it was 701.6 taels. Then there was a difference of more than one tael, but generally, bulls took this opportunity to sell, falling back three taels to 98.2 taels at 4:00. The April US dollar was also 0625. Afterwards, the buying interest was still strong, and the price rose three taels. At 4:30, the market closed at 701 taels, an increase of 14.5 taels compared to last Saturday. It has been increasing for three consecutive days. (After the market closed, it was done again to 023 taels, so there was a double entry of accounts.

<h3>Silver Coin Market Still Difficult to Ease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, banks opened and closed as usual, but the business atmosphere was still difficult to smooth. The transaction in the money industry market was sparse as usual. The early market price of foreign cents was 7 qian and 0.09 li, and the noon market price suddenly increased by 0.015 li, to 7 qian, 0.15 li. The silver discount rate for both the morning and noon markets was 1.7 qian, an increase of 0.1 qian compared to the previous rate. The settlement price for water addition was 2 qian. The bank listed the price at 7 fen. The remittance exchange ticket amount made was 380,000 in the morning market and 345,000 in the noon market. The banknote amount was 15,000 in the morning market and 5,000 in the noon market. The bank transactions were 650,000 in both markets. The discount ticket transactions were over 1.6 million. The foreign bank received and released various amounts of over 4.8 million, with over 800,000 in remittances and over 600,000 in pledge remittances. The Chinese bank received and released various amounts of over 3.9 million, with over 500,000 in customs duties and over 600,000 in remittances. The private banks received and released over 4.4 million for foreign public singles and over 35 million for silver public singles. The small private bank transactions were over 500,000. The morning and noon market prices for Jiangnan small foreign coins were both 6 qian, 0.195 li, with 3,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 1,000 jiao in the noon market. The early market price for Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 qian, 0.245 li, and the noon market price was 6 qian, 0.26 li, with 105,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins suddenly decreased by 3,500 wen, to 412,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Interest Rate Negotiation</h3>
<p>The March interest rate, with the silver base moderate, so the interest rate market was not very high. The regular meeting yesterday decided that the deposit interest rate would be 5.5 taels, 95% off, and the outstanding interest would be increased according to the rate, so the highest outstanding interest rate was expected to be 11.5 taels.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Sales Still No More Than Scattered Embellishments</h3>
<p>Hopes for a Large Spring Sale Have Become Desperate</p>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn is in a state of calm, but the trend is extremely weak. In previous years, during the spring sales season, there was a large development. Now, due to the national crisis, financial circulation is impossible. The situation is peaceful, but there is no certainty, causing people to be uneasy. The economy in the inland areas is very difficult, and yarn sales are greatly lacking. As for the Yangtze River route, there is no vitality. The most promising area, South China, has also been unresponsive recently. Cantonese merchants are returning the yarn they purchased before, which shows that the business is very quiet. However, scattered transactions between various merchants have not been interrupted. It is found that customers bought more than 300 packages throughout the day, including 45 packages from the same industry, 145 packages from Shantou, 30 packages from Jiangxi, 20 packages from Xiamen, 22 packages from the inland, 26 packages from Ningbo, and 25 packages from the northern merchants. The market prices vary.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Enters 300 Packages of Xiasha Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, and the current cotton sales are deserted. Factories are not motivated to do business because the world cotton market is sluggish and yarn sales are stagnant. However, the supply from the Han route is sparse, and the local inventory is thin, so the market can still be calm. The current cotton being made open is listed below:</p>
<p>Xiasha Cotton 34.25 Shenxin Enters 10 Packages of Spot Goods to Send to the Factory</p>
<p>34.00 Also 100 Packages Also</p>
<p>33.75 Also 100 Packages Also</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton 35.25 Also 100 Pieces Also</p>
<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Lacks Optimism The market price last week was soft due to unfavorable news about American cotton. At present, many parties continue to liquidate in large quantities. Although Indian cotton has fallen, it is still more expensive than American cotton. The July-August period will be on the market on April 4, and it is expected that there may be hope for prosperity. Arrivals of White Luo Creek and Taogela districts continue to increase. Without encouraging news about American cotton, it is difficult to be optimistic here. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousand packages)</p>
<p>1932 1931</p>
<p>Total listed from September 1, 1,191 2,433</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 635 933</p>
<p>Total exports from September 1, 640 1,680</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 96 421</p>
<p>Shipped to China 150 229</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 368 995</p>
<p>Other regions 26 15</p>
<p>British Cotton Market is Uncertain Spot sales were mixed last week, and futures rose and fell with American cotton. However, the main reason was the uncertainty of the American budget and the tax on the sale of American cotton. There was slight progress on the weekend due to silver prices, but the overall trend is still uncertain. Although Egyptian cotton is under pressure from sellers, the market situation still changes with American cotton.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Weak During Qingming Festival</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 30 to 40 rice boats arrived in the southern city of Shanghai. The Qingming Festival is approaching, and cash is tight. People are calm, and the trend is sluggish. Cargo in Zhongguan feels more stagnant. The price of Northern rice is high and stable, but then sluggish. There are few scattered transactions of early and late rice. Sandboat merchants have slight transactions, and prices are stable. There is weak demand for foreign Du Jian, and the market is trending downward. Bian Yuan lacks supply.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was estimated that there were seven or eight sources from the northern part of Shanghai. Transactions in this street were lighter than in the previous market. The arrival and sales of Northern rice were balanced, and prices remained the same. The price of late rice fell by 0.05 taels. Foreign rice Jian had no supply. There were about 3,000 stones of He Xia Hujiao.</p>
<h3>Revival of Foreign Rice Sales</h3>
<p>Hankou, Jiangbei, and Rural Villages in This Street Have All Made Deals</p>
<p>The Market Situation Continues to Stabilize</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of foreign rice was active again. In addition to continuing business in this street, new rural villages and merchants from Jiangbei and Hankou came to buy, and the market began to stabilize. However, due to sufficient inventory, two more boats arrived in the past two days, and it is difficult to expect the market price to rise in the short term. Yesterday, a total of about 5,000 packages of small twisted rice, 700 packages of Mindang rice, and more than 200 packages of Saigon No. 1 were opened in the market. Small twisted rice was priced at 9.47 yuan and 4.55 yuan. The high was 9.62 yuan. Mindang was 9.85 yuan, and Saigon was 10.067 yuan. It is estimated that merchants from Hankou loaded 3,000 packages of small twisted rice, merchants from Jiangbei loaded 300 packages of small twisted rice, and the rest were received by rural villages and this street. Futures opened for nearly 1,000 tons of small twisted rice, 4.73 taels for April and 4.55 taels for March.</p>
<h3>The Flour Price Surge Continues</h3>
<p>Warship Price Opens at 2.045 Taels Net</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly showed a sharp increase. Due to continued competition from the north and the Yangtze River area, coupled with rumors of a poor harvest of foreign wheat, the quoted price rose by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. Therefore, when the spot price opened, the warship price initially opened at 2.03 taels, and jumped up by 0.005 taels. Later, due to the enthusiastic demand from customers, it continued to rise. By the end, it opened at 2.045 taels net (factories called for 2.05 taels), a huge jump of 0.04 taels compared to the previous week's closing price. According to this situation, if factories allow it to rise, there is still a trend to continue to rise. The red and blue car price was 0.01 tael lower than the warship price, opening at 2.035 taels. The green turret price was 0.025 taels lower, opening at 2.02 taels. The green double horse price was 0.025 taels lower, opening at 2.02 taels.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Dried Longan Temporarily Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, there has been no arrival of dried longan. The top grade stone horse goods stored in the store once opened at 95-96 taels. The next best was the Xiamen goods, which previously cost 51 taels and now cost 53 taels, with no goods available. Only the medium grade goods are stored, and Gao Zhuang is temporarily out of stock. It is heard that the local area is also short of goods. Even if there are arrivals, there will not be many.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Woolen Fabrics Are Very Cheap</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market has seen some progress recently. The retail business of shops in this street has been increasing daily, but the selling price is very cheap. The wholesale market is, on average, 0.1 to 0.2 yuan cheaper than last year. All types of woolen fabrics, such as headwear flannel, various serges, Water serge, satin, chocolate flannel, raincoat cloth, and mandarin jacket flannel, have fallen in price across the board. Except for the miscellaneous color serge, which has only been reduced by a few cents, most have been greatly reduced, and Water serge is especially so. Yesterday, good chocolate flannel was sold for 3.25 taels, Ningfeng Tianfu for 3.05 taels, Ningfeng plaid Water serge for 3.1 taels, Tianfu for 3 taels, Rongtai Deji for 3.25 taels, Yongxing mixed-color Water serge for 4.15 taels, and Wah Kee No. 1 for 4.75 taels.</p>
<h3>Domestic Camel Wool Falls Below 2 Taels</h3>
<p>Domestic factory's wide and tight camel wool has been selling extremely well in recent years, especially the five-color striped ones. Last year, the highest price for various brands such as Weilun, Tianxiang, Shengda, Xianda, and Weiyi was over 2.5 taels, and the lowest was 2.15 taels. Now, due to tight money and the gradual warming of the weather, sales are stagnant, so the price has fallen, even falling below 2 taels. Most of the wholesale is only sold for 1.8-1.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Telegrams to Shanghai Awaiting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port was still idle. It is found that various European firms are holding a wait-and-see attitude because overseas silk telegrams did not transfer to Shanghai yesterday. Although Chinese silk merchants have a thick stock of silk in hand, the silk itself is not cheap and they are unwilling to sell at a loss. The market atmosphere is quiet. Yesterday, only Xinshichang entered five packages of Huang factory warp, and Dachang and others entered fifteen packages of white Qian warp. The price is still flat and weak.</p>

<h3>Engagement Announcement</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>"We, introduced by Mr. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so, and with the consent of both parents, are engaged in Shanghai on So-and-so Month So-and-so Date. As the country is in distress, customs are waived. We hereby inform all relatives and friends for their information."</p>
<p>Advertisements of this kind have been appearing in newspapers almost every day since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, or even several such advertisements can be found in one day, which is great! With the country in distress, the opportunity is rare, the price is low, and the goods are of good quality, so don't miss this great opportunity.</p>
<p>Love and saving the country is now the freshest and most fashionable term. By spending only three or four dollars, you can complete our life's event and build the tomb of our love. The planes rumbling in the sky, look at them what! The sound of cannons in Kunshan, Taicang and other places, listen to them what! The tragic situation in Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei and other places has nothing to do with me, care about it what! To be satisfied, a match made in heaven, I wish all lovers in the world could become a family.</p>
<p>However, if I were to analyze this kind of advertisement, there would be at least two kinds. One is that the love is strong and it is publicized. The other is that the economy is stressed and savings are made. But in a time of national crisis, can this kind of love be sustained? If you say that the economy is stressed, then after marriage, there will be another burden on one side, wouldn't the economy be even more difficult? In short, the most important element of youth is not marriage, and marriage is definitely not a lifelong event. Studying is a lifelong event, and career is a lifelong event. To fulfill the greatest aspirations and most important mission of the nation is a lifelong event.</p>
<p>Indeed, the marriage rituals of the past were too troublesome, too wasteful, too verbose and tedious, and very annoying. Now, the new "engagement announcement" is the easiest and most feasible. If this is the case, then not only can all customs be waived in the time of national crisis, but even if it is not the time of national crisis, since it is said to be a custom, it can also be waived. Why must you borrow the big topic of national crisis to complete the courtesy of expressing your love?</p>
<p>May I ask if the time of national crisis is the time for you to get engaged? Is the time of national crisis the time for you to get married? The ancients said, "If the country is not a country, there is no home." Today's people have "Engagement Announcement during National Crisis." It's interesting, no wonder some people say that ancient and modern people are not the same!</p>

<h3>Brigadier Weng</h3>
<p>— Dream Bamboo Art Hermitage Master</p>
<p>After the National Army withdrew, Brigadier Weng Zhaoyuan still guarded Wusong. The elders of the village strongly urged him to go.</p>
<p>Thirty days of bloody battles on the coast, don't judge heroes by success or failure.</p>
<p>Think calmly about the retreat of the entire army, and sigh that you can teach ten thousand people to agree.</p>
<p>If I don't die, I will kill the enemy, and I will see my original intention in danger today.</p>
<p>Military strategists originally did not fight for a single stake, and the final victory depends on the final merit.</p>
<h3>Poem on the Death of General Teng</h3>
<p>— Dream Bamboo Hermitage Master</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Teng Jiushou of the Wusong Fortress Command</p>
<p>·A native of Guizhou·On February 4·Commanded to</p>
<p>Fortress Supervisor Battle·Enemy Bullet Hits Left Arm·Still Bravely</p>
<p>Ascend·Enemy Bullet Hits His Right Rib Again·Then Martyred·</p>
<p>There is an old mother and a widow at home·Commendation of Loyalty is Awaited·Returning Coffin</p>
<p>There is no date·Write this to mourn it·</p>
<p>Black wind blows the sea and the sea water stands, a platform controls the sea high and sucking.</p>
<p>Crazy thunder grinds the ground and fire boils the river, and the reflected three armies' clothes are all red.</p>
<p>The general stood in front of the fire alone, holding a skull and throwing it to the sky.</p>
<p>Before reaching half of the high platform, a fire had hit the general's shoulder.</p>
<p>What I don't avoid is going through boiling water and trampling on fire, and I swear to die on the land of Wusong.</p>
<p>I don't care about risking my life in a bloody battle, and I shake Li Ling's arm to boost the army's spirit.</p>
<p>The river is foggy and the wind is bleak, the turtle turns over the cave and the monkey climbs the ladder.</p>
<p>The general is full of iron blood and courage, and his fierce spirit still overwhelms whales and dolphins.</p>
<p>The sound of drums is dying and the sun is colorless, and the sea clouds are connected to the sky like ink.</p>
<p>Another bullet pierces the general's waist, and he can still shout to kill the enemy before he dies.</p>
<p>The Central Army blew off the broken bear and tiger flag, and a big star fell into the water with a slight light.</p>
<p>The lonely loyalty has been around since ancient times, and those who hear his deeds all weep.</p>
<p>The general died for the country and the matter is not over, the old mother is in the hall and the wife is in the room.</p>
<p>Shen Shen tigers and leopards are in charge today, and I sigh that I know when the commemoration of loyalty will be.</p>
<p>Yelang is far away and the wind and clouds are cold, and it is difficult to return the coffin through thousands of mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>I express my loyalty with this poem, and the mother will order the patriots to break their hearts.</p>

<h3>Gunpowder</h3>
<p>— Meng Fu</p>
<p>Gunpowder has existed since ancient times, and our country has used it very early. In modern times, with the flourishing of science, the uses of gunpowder have become more extensive, occupying an important position in both industry and military affairs. Especially in military affairs, modern warfare is almost centered on gunpowder. If all the gunpowder in the world were completely gone, perhaps the hope for permanent peace among mankind could be realized. Now, our country is facing increasing foreign insults, and a war of self-defense is probably unavoidable, so I specifically bring up gunpowder to conduct a simple study.</p>
<p>What exactly is gunpowder? Gunpowder is the name for unstable compounds or mixtures that undergo drastic changes when subjected to impact or heat, generating high heat and a large amount of gas. Based on the nature of its composition, it can be divided into two major categories: mixed gunpowder and compound gunpowder, briefly described below:</p>
<p>(A) Mixed Gunpowder</p>
<p>(1) Black Gunpowder: This gunpowder can be considered the ancestor of gunpowder, made by mixing saltpeter (KNOm), sulfur (Sulfur), and charcoal. The ratio of the three substances is most commonly about 75% saltpeter, 10% sulfur, and 15% charcoal. Charcoal is the main component for combustion, saltpeter contains a lot of oxygen, which supports combustion. Sulfur has combustible and cohesive properties, which can help the charcoal burn and bind the charcoal and saltpeter together to prevent them from separating and increase the explosive effect. Since the invention of smokeless powder, this powder has almost been eliminated, but it is still used as a low-power blasting agent in mines and as a slow-burning fuse.</p>
<p>(2) Brown Gunpowder: This powder is a variant of black powder, also made by mixing charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur. However, the mixture is brown. The explosive power is higher than black powder. In the past, it was all used as propellant, but with the advent of smokeless powder, it has gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>(B) Compound Gunpowder</p>
<p>(1) Nitrocellulose Smokeless Powder: Take clean cotton and immerse it in a mixture of nitric acid (Nitric Acid HNO3) and sulfuric acid (Sulfuric Acid H2SO4). The two combine to produce a type of nitrocellulose. However, there is more than one type of nitrocellulose. Depending on the degree of nitration, about eight types can be obtained. Any nitrate that is insoluble in a mixture of alcohol and ether is called strong cotton gunpowder. Those that can be dissolved are called weak cotton gunpowder. Take an appropriate amount of strong and weak cotton gunpowder and mix it to make powder grains. This is used in current guns and cannons. Because this powder ignites accurately and has a very large explosive force, and after burning, the entire powder becomes gas, leaving no residue, which prevents the gun barrel from becoming dirty, it is truly the best propellant powder.</p>
<p>(2) Nitroglycerin Smokeless Powder: Add pure glycerin to a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. After half an hour, the two combine to form nitroglycerin. Take an appropriate amount of cotton powder and add it to nitroglycerin. This type of smokeless powder can also be made in accordance with the law. Its properties are generally the same as nitrocellulose powder, and its explosive force is stronger. From the perspective of launching power, it seems to be beneficial, but the explosion temperature is too high, and the gun barrel is easily blown up. This is inferior to nitrocellulose powder. The manufacturing price is still low. Because the explosive power is strong, most of the explosives used in mining and other industries use this powder as the main ingredient.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the power of gunpowder, roughly speaking, the gas generated by the explosion of each kilogram of gunpowder is more than ten thousand times larger than the original volume of the gunpowder. A 16-inch cannon shell (weighing about 1,000 catties) only takes four hundredths of a second from launch to muzzle. This is still low-grade gunpowder. The power of high-grade strong gunpowder is truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>There are many types of gunpowder, but now I am only listing a few of the main ones. The detailed gunpowder manufacturing method is also omitted because things in popular science should be more popular. The above is just to give readers some knowledge of gunpowder.</p>

<h3>A Letter Describing the Post-War Inspection of Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Describing the inspection of the battlefield and the wishes of the future, to my esteemed friend Mr. So-and-so: A few days ago (March 31), my friend and I went to the battlefield for inspection. Starting from my residence, we witnessed the tragic scene along the way, which was heartbreaking and touching. We lamented the situation encountered by our compatriots and the huge and inestimable loss of all lives and property. It was truly a catastrophe unprecedented in ancient times.</p>
<p>Starting from Sichuan Road, British soldiers were stationed along the way. At the Sichuan Road Bridge, there were Japanese military police and Indian guards stationed at the bridgehead. Along the street, there were buildings that had not been bombarded, setting up small stalls and trading as usual. The North Sichuan Road, once known as a mysterious street, was brightly lit, like daylight, but now it has become a sparsely populated, desolate street. On the way, most of the pedestrians were enemies from the East, or they were riding in cars, flaunting their power, speeding past with laughter. Some were holding guns, heads held high, chests puffed out, arrogant and aggressive, coming and going incessantly.</p>
<p>Near the Odeon Theater, the ruined walls and broken walls were vivid in my mind, and there were even fewer pedestrians. This place was once the most lively place. When the lights were on, the sounds of music and singing were melodious and pleasant. Chinese and foreign men and women were heavily made up and dressed in brightly colored clothes, with smiling faces, graceful and charming, walking lightly. Now they are all gone.</p>
<p>North of Daxun Lane, it was not yet dark, and two or three Japanese soldiers were standing. We couldn't bear to see this, so we turned back into Qiujiang Road and entered Guangwu Terrace. The surrounding houses were full of rubble, and it was difficult to walk on the rugged terrain, and we almost fell. A few Jiangbei people were carrying brooms and walking back and forth on the road. Some enemy marines were standing there, and several Jiangbei traitors were gesticulating and laughing with them. It is expected that these people are taking advantage of the fire to loot, acting as accomplices of tigers, and are undoubtedly Jiangbei traitors who are willing to be puppets of a conquered country.</p>
<p>When we got close to the railway station, two enemies directed us to turn back. We could no longer go forward. Thinking about the situation further past, it was even more unbearable to look at than Qiujiang Road. Beside the road were the remains of enemy dead soldiers, with wooden plaques erected on them, reading "Sergeant So-and-so of Showa [year] died in battle here," etc. Sandbags were placed around it, and incense sticks were placed on top, scattered in a mess. It can be seen that the enemy also has the practice of burning incense to express mourning. Several Westerners drove past, frowning and shaking their heads, with sad expressions on their faces. Alas, these are all buildings built with the sweat and blood of our compatriots, and they are the remains of the enemy's trampling. Recalling the European War, Germany, which wanted to dominate the world, its sins were nothing more than this. In the end, it could not avoid failure. Now the enemy dominates East Asia, and the result is not difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>The World's Longest-Lived Race</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>An American doctor in London, named Abelde, once went to Tibet for exploration with the female explorer Cyril Crosley Bradford. Now he has published a short article about his exploration. He said that in the Himalayas, he discovered a rare long-lived race in the world. Their ages are all over 100 years old. This race is the descendant of the Chaldean race that built ancient Babylonian civilization and is now extinct. Because there is very clear and obvious evidence that can prove it, that is, the characters they use are completely the hieroglyphs of the ancient Chaldeans. Later, after detailed investigation, the lifespan of the people in this race is almost all over 100 years old. They live their lives ignorantly and do not know what is wrong. People over 100 years old are all black-haired and have youthful looks, and their energy is healthy, like we are in our thirties or forties. It is said that their food is only picking wild vegetables, and they absolutely do not import fish or meat. They live in cold and barren mountainous areas. Because it is not easy to get fresh wild vegetables, they all go to the tropical areas at the foot of the mountain in the summer to collect winter food. Moreover, they are not afraid of the cold, and the clothes they wear are extremely thin. Their skin is white and rosy. Presumably they originated from Mesopotamia, the hometown of Mesopotamia, 2000 BC, and gradually moved to northern India. The marriage age within this race must be at least 80 years old before they get married. Young women in their twenties and thirties are incomparably beautiful, with their hair draped over their shoulders, lively and lovely, and often play music as their only entertainment. Why are they so long-lived? It really makes Westerners unable to figure it out.</p>
