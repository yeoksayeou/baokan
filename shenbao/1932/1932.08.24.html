<p>齋藤非常内閣下之第二次臨時議會己於昨日召集。今日舉行開院儀式。明日即開始全院委員長及各常任委員之選舉此次議會中之論題。其主要者當不外對東北對聯盟及業農村中小商工業者救濟等三端。但各派壁壘森嚴。在後日政府施政演説以後。議塲空氣。必驟轉險惡。殆屬無疑。在目前日本衆議院中。其各派之分布狀態。政友會爲二百九十八名。民政黨爲百二十二名。國民同盟三十名依今日之形勢而論。準與黨之民政。大體主張維持現政府之暫局。而不欲妄作政治運動之嘗試。但若準野黨之政友與國民同盟。則務予政府以極大之抨擊。是可斷言。最近在政友會内。有鈴木等稳健派及森恪等强硬派之分。而後者之勢力。轉在乎前者之上。據東京消息異日政友强硬派之挑戰點。似擬集中於經濟問題痛責政府之下履行前六十二議會中之通貨澎漲及負債整理决議案。而訾政府之預算爲不誠意。但其最終目的。不外欲藉現政府經濟上之缺點。以攘奪政權耳。至國民同盟（安逹脱民政黨後所組織）對議會之態度。亦不滿於現政府之一切施設。而提出非常對策六條。以反證政府匡救策之緩弛。不足拯救目前之非常時局。此外在無産黨方面。則注重於市民生活之改善。（社會大衆黨）或注重於滿蒙權益之國家社會主義化。（國家社會主義勞動同盟）要之今日日本内部國内要電</p>

<p>園中畜狗至數十頭。派專人經管其事。每日飼狗以牛肉白米飯。所費不資。某日。一日人持狗像片請求干謁。漙儀延見後。詢其來意。日人云。[敝國某商行經理。家畜一狗。性極馴。解人意。且善守夜。有千百樣之技術。如尊處樓房。亦可一躍而上。刻其人擬出售此狗。聞閣下愛狗成癖。情倩余介紹。願以此狗讓歸閣下。如閣下有意。即可訂立草约。鄙人必遵期由敝國運到。]言下以像片交閲。溥儀視之。狗固雄頭偉幹。長耳狐形。狀極俊異。心觸所好。亟問價若干。日人笑伸二指。浦儀問[二百金]乎。日人摇首。溥儀又問[二千金乎。日人仍摇首。浦儀駭問。豈[二萬金]乎。日人笑曰[然。特值頗昂。恐閣下不肯出此巨欵耳。]溥儀爲所激。竊思吾嘗作過大清皇帝。二萬金何足惜。此日人未免淺之乎視我。遂毅然書付草約。定半月同生同死  許厪父從前尉友要好。結拜兄弟。都有什麽同年同月同日生。同年同月同日死的套話。按到實事。不但同時生的没有聽到。至於同時死的事情。更是絶對没有。就不説朋友的結拜。而説親兄弟吧。雙胞胎的兄弟。我們常常聽見。雖然胞胎落地。也有時間的先後。但照中國老式的計時法。以兩小時爲一個時辰。雙胞胎産出的距離。大概不出個把鐘頭。假使此個把鐘頭。恰在同一時辰的。也究竟還是没有。不料今年時疫中。却有一事。應了這句古話了。友人杭君。從浙江來。談及諸暨山鄉。有雙胞胎的兄弟。都己娶妻生子。今年弟先得病。剛在咽氣。兄適往訪視。俄頃之間。染疫立斃。咽氣者還没有斷氣咧。更過十分時。弟亦隨逝。鄉人傅説。此一對弟兄産下時。同爲子時。死時又同在申時。眞可謂同年同月同日生。同年同月同日死了。運狗蒞津。日人請先付半價溥儀允之。日人當挽爲溥儀守門之日警作保。取得一萬元之支票。欣然逕去。越半月。狗果運到。大如驢。的是異種。惟兩萬元則殊不值。溥儀以有諾在前。不有後悔。忍痛付金如數。收受此狗。顧事後試狗以技。則銀樣蠟槍頭。並無若何驚人表演。溥儀遂如啞子吃黄連。有苦莫訴矣。泥皇閣品茶記  火雪明識江都夏宜滋。許爲寒林瘦鶴。以狀其形。梅牕斜月。以喻其神。蓋清而不媚。寓俠骨於温淳冲穆之間。散金結客以自存。何其賢哉。夏予善製印泥。梳藕絲爲骨。調朱滋油。明絶妍静。出爲世用。噲炙於士人之口。侯疑始上以曾號曰泥皇。非偶然也。始是夏子命其寓廬曰泥皇閣以自慶其技。夏子深悟茶之原之法。並及其具。名彰江南。以是泥皇閣座上。輒滿盧仝陸羽常伯熊其人。愚數應其造閣飲茶。卒分杯羹於今夏中伏沐日。與鄧子糞翁偕焉。而藏書甚豐。碑板尤多稀世之珍。時己日午。先我在者。畫師張善孖·大千兄弟。皆垂須龐眉。娓娓話匡廬游蹤。環桌得六人。夏子遂出淡碧之碟一。小盅一。色與碟同。置人人胸前。先注暖水。以待水温。而又取獅子峰火前嫩葉。傾滿紫泥壺中。汲惠泉熱水泡之。頓有清韻。舒徐飄盪。游泳書架簾波間。令人氣爽。蓋未飲而神先馴矣。夏子炙手壺外。體其熱度己可。始請出盅内水。而替内火前茶。謂盅賸水温。以固茶香。其韻彌永。試之殊是。不識社前之味復何似。旋郵王周今覺。亦翩然蒞至。與共桌。進品荷花。凉爽之氣。清沁齒頰。香而不濁。淡而有韻。的屬神品。大千謂成都荷花大如斗。莖可尋長。藕如牛股。相驚爲奇談。今覺以盧法入哲。謂矮圖其人而高大其花。固不能取人必信。然花之高且大。果非不稽之談也。其語甚雋。再試水仙。亦神骨清绝。幽静如處子。而不事鉛華。一種冰雪姿態。更足耐人尋味。可云妙品。最後品野茶。以梅花焙成。其色鵝黃無味。惟留面餘草香氣息。方之高僧逸士。流浪河嶽。究其眞味。細而後辨。差堪比儗。夏子謂野茶出自青海西藏。漢中初不多飲。則又異品矣。低斟淺嘗。點滴潤唇。以視南齊王應。一飲一斗。號爲漏巵者。我輩其七碗之流乎。時他客駢集。不可以久留。後今覺而出。夏子殷勤囑爲之記。正趁歸途。雲腴沁腦。思抽乙乙。而空有呼糞翁姓氏者。謂將去泥皇閣品茶。視之。朱其石也。瘟風疫雨話秦中  閻重樓今歲各均患疫癘。乃陜省適當最烈之區。昨有友自西安來。爲述疫癘禍陜各種慘况。因記之以告讀者。藥物轉運困難陜省僻處西陲。交通素稱梗塞。平時地方對於防疫藥品。又少準備。此次瘟疫起於潼關。不久竟延及華陰。當局爲制止疫勢起見。不得不斷絶西潼路缐交通。乃因此而藥物轉運更感困難即防疫臭水痧藥水等亦求之不得。故疫勢愈演愈烈。終一發而不可收拾矣。棺材售賣一空交通雖斷。然疫勢不久即蔓延全省。長安爲陜西省會。居民最衆。死亡亦最多。以致各棺材店存之棺。售賣一空。後死者乃不得不以席代之。災情之慘。於此可見。居民杜門謝客患疫癘者。朝發夕死某傅染之遠。誠不可思議。於是各地居民宅前。多張貼有[内無人居]。或[闔家遠徙]字條者。蓋其中人踡伏避疫。藉此拒絶親友之求見耳。名士亦罹奇厄　防疫設施。雖感缺乏。然居民多有懷疑注射防疫針之效力。而不願受術者。於是衛生當局。對於此輩居民。竟亦無法可施。徒呼負負。最可嘆者。爲關中名士宋芝田（伯魯）侍御。八十老翁。體素康健。乃此次亦因拒絶注射。患疫不起。噫。可哀也。敬告讀者本刊去年曾組織説部扶輪會特約幾位小説家撰著短篇小説，當時一般讀者非，常贊許，因此，我們决定重復舉行，參加撰述的作家，有十餘位之多。第一種是言情小説［銀絲］，是江紅蕉先生的名著，定九月一日起刋登，請讀者們注意自由談編輯部啓短訊本埠德新化工廠。最近出品［人造牙筷］一種。質料精良。無異眞牙。兹因創業紀念。特備紀念筷一萬把。發售特價。每把僅售工洋一元。本埠經理處法大馬路興聖街口信泰祥毛綸號。廠址南市南倉街染坊弄云。二十一條秘史（二）  思蘋他問我假使日本提出苛刻的要求。我爲他設身處地着想應怎樣辦。我告訴他。你雖則不能恒久抵抗日本的侵略。中國雖則不免立即失去沿海一帶的城池和北京首都。但是你儘可効法美國的革命戰争。西班牙俄羅斯的抵敵拿破倫。以及新近菲洲土人的反抗英國。你儘可毁壞鐵路和一切足以資敵的東西。且戰且退。實行遊擊戰。假使他一朝能實行遊擊戰爲天下倡。全中國的人民一定聞風興起。同日本人拚個你死我活。我相信中國地廣民衆。缺乏鐵路。日本人一輩子不能征服中國人民的。我後來從蔡廷幹方面得悉。袁世凱得了我這忠告。十分愉快。他同蔡廷幹討論這個計劃三四次之多。他向蔡聲明。萬一日本侵略中國。他决計這樣幹。我遂怱怱整裝西行二月裏我從中國西部回來。先到上海。抵滬之前。我己從報紙驚悉日本己向中國提出嚴重要求。既到上海。我接得北京樂禮博士來信告訴我。中國政府呌我兼程回京。樂禮説蔡廷幹己通知他。日本己向中國提出二十一條要求了。最後七條呌做第五項的。實際上把中國主權移交日本了。樂禮要我從速返京。我遂設法使美國注意此事。我先同魯主教商量。把此事經過告訴他。並且向他説。我擬越規干與政事。想把中國發生的嚴重事件。由美公使請求華盛頓政府向日本提出嚴重抗議。魯主教表示贊同。我因請他去見郭主教。請他也答允在這請求書簽名。當天晚上。他就到聖約翰大學見郭主教。直至夜半始回。回來之後。他就草一上美政府的短文。早上。他告訴我。郭主教很關心。呈文的内容和格式如爲他所贊同。他允許署名。他因把郭主教可以簽字的呈文給我看。我把它修正後。寄往美公使芮恩士。我拿了這呈文去見駐滬美總領事。他在日本住了好幾年。很看得起日本人。他同我説。日本人决没有向中國提出這類要求。我告訴他。我可親自担保有這要求。他遂答允把我們的請求卆書寄給芮恩士。他並且加上幾句説明日本此舉影響美國對華贸易甚大。魯主教遂把這修正過的呈文去見郭主教和卜舫濟博士。二人多署了名。我就拿這呈文再去遍訪各教會代表。連署的共得十人之多。這項手續上一九一五年二月二十至二十五日之間完竣。正誤昨日本文第一句我自一九０七年脱一［九］字特此申明</p>

<p>流影夏天的先生，好像個個都有催眠術的本領的在教室外活活潑潑的人，怎麽被上課鐘趕進教室去，聽不到先生講五六分鐘的書，便會伸欠接二連三的要催人打鼾睡的呢。這　　　我進教室遲了一步，後面的坐位都給人家搶去了。我只得在前排老是幾個女同學坐的一個空着的位置上坐下，心裏想道［這個鐘頭只好不打瞌睡了］！可是不到一刻鐘，先生的聲調與我的呼吸湊成一種微妙的節凑，像是催眠曲一般使我的神志漸漸恍惚起來。起初我的意識上像罩着了一層薄膜，耳朶邊只覺得有像蚊蟲聲一般微細的聲音時而可聞時而不可聞地在響。既而這些斷斷續續的音聲感覺，也漸漸被逐出意識圈外去，我終而走進了無聲無色無臭無光的虚無世界了。但是一會兒，或則即是我剛踏進這世界的同一瞬間也未可知，一個突然的驚怔當時只覺得我的周圍似乎突然一亮丨將我從漆黑的世界拉回到光的世界來了。我纔知道這是因爲我的頭漸漸向前垂下，身子失去了平衡正要向前倒下去的一瞬間。幸而在我的意識尚未復蘇時，我的頭己因無意識的反射運動迅速地像彈簧似的抬了起來，恢復了身子的平衡。我又打了一個表示未睡舒服的伸欠，擦擦眼睛，挺起上眼皮，看見先生在講台上講書，一隻手揮着扇子一隻手拿手帕在揩額上的汗。我又轉首向四周探看·全教室的人，十有八九己睡着了。我頓起了好奇心，把打瞌睡的姿勢一個個加以觀察。大部分是用右手撑着頭，他們的手肘正在連接他們的眼部與先生的眼部的那條直綫上。從講台上看下來辨不出他們是在看書，抑是在静心傾聽先生講書。從傍邊的地點看去，知道他們緊閉着兩眼睛睡意正濃呢。有幾個將兩隻手臂放在桌上，下巴擱在手背上，身子特别坐得低一點，他們的面部，被前面的同學遮斷先生的視線。有幾個用一隻手臂放在桌上，身子更加坐得低，把額角擱在臂上垂着頭，或是把一邊的頰貼在臂上横着頭睡着。他們也全靠前面的同學遮掩他們。但有幾個因爲坐在前面的同學在他們入睡後也相繼地在同樣的姿勢中睡着，所以早己暴露了他們的秘密。和我同排的一個胖得像羅漢一般的女同學睡法最妙。她只略把股部坐得出一點，背部靠後一點，垂着頭靠在椅背上睡着了。大概她的重心特别稳些吧。她的額上，鼻上，唇中，都密佈着一粒一粒的汗珠。下唇還掛着一條像絲粉似的唾涎。她雖緊閉着兩眠，但因爲她戴着一副深茶色的眼鏡，所以從前方看不出她在睡的。只有三四個女同學没睡着，不過都在偷看小説。！這位先生是在魯濱孫漂流過的無人島上講書。……他怕也明明知道没人在聽他吧。只爲了要拿薪水，在敷衍塞責吧。……唉，何苦……我正在這樣替先生轉種種念頭的時候，那位胖的女同學忽然開始打起鼾聲來了。起初打了一個低低的鼾聲，女同學們都己放了書捫了嘴暗笑了。一個女同學還擠了她一下，但是她似乎酣睡得很，覺也不覺得。鼾聲漸漸響起來了，女同學都擰住嘴吃吃地笑她。她每打一個鼾，大家都抬起頭來看看先生的面相。先生像是没有聽見只管講他的書。她的鼾聲愈打愈大了，最後打一個長長的鼾，因爲吸進去的空氣梗住了喉嚨，像驢子呌一般，發出了個極大的怪聲響。幾個女同學不禁一齊大聲笑了出來。全教室的同學都驚醒了。許多頭東西張望不知出了什麽事。那個胖的女同學也醒了，大概是硬醒的吧。這時先生似乎覺得不好再裝聾了。他抬起頭來向那位胖的女同學看了一眼，又向傍邊的幾個女同學微微笑了一笑，仍舊低下頭去顧自己講書了。公佈欄江蘇高等法院第三分院訓令令署江蘇上海第二特區地方法院院長應時爲令遵事案奉司法行政部訓字第一七零八號訓令内開爲令遵事查簡易案件依法得以言詞起訴從前各州縣判案尚有因口頭喊控受理者近查各法院受訴即遇簡易訴訟亦多責令備具書狀既於當事人諸多不便且於法律所定顯有未符殊非恤民守法之道本部爲實事求是起見所有民事訴訟法第三百九十三條所列得用言詞起訴之各欵事件各法院須逐一照録印刷多份粘貼法院門首并登該地方新聞報紙俾衆週知嗣後輕微訟案無論爲起訴爲聲明或爲陳述均可以言詞爲之母須限用書狀藉順民情而重法令合行令仰該法院遵照并轉飭所屬一體遵照辦理仍將遵照辦理情形具報備查此令等因奉此合行令仰該院長即便遵照辦理仍將遵照辦理情形具報以憑轉報備查此令中華民國二十一年七月三十日院長梁仁傑民事簡易庭訴訟程序（抄録民事訴訟法第二編第二章）第三百九十三條關於財産權之訴訟其標的金額或價額在八百元以下者適用本章所定之簡易程序左列各欵訴訟從其標的之金額或價額逾八百元者亦適用簡易程序（一）出租人或承租人因接收房屋或遷讓使用修繕或因扣留承租人之家具物品涉訟者（二）雇用人與受僱人因僱傭契約涉訟其僱傭期間在一年以下者（三）旅客與旅館主人飲食主人或運送人因關於食宿運送費或因寄存行李財物涉訟者（四）因請求保護占有涉訟者（五）因定不動産之界綫或設置界標涉訟者（六）其他訴訟經當事人合意聲請適用簡易程序者第三百九十四條起訴及其他聲明或陳述得以言詞爲之第三百九十五條以言詞起訴者應在推事前爲之由法院書記官作成筆録並向原告朗讀或交令閲覽前項情形推事就原告所應聲明或應陳述之事項應爲相當之指示第三百九十六條以言詞起訴者應將前條筆録繕本與言詞辯論期日之傅票一併送逹被告就審期間至少應有三日但有急迫情形者不在此限第三百九十七條言詞辯論期日之傅票應記明當事人務於辯論期日携帶所用證物及偕同所舉證人到塲第三百九十八條言詞辯論得以書狀或筆録準備之第三百九十九條當事人兩造於法院通常開庭之日得不待傅喚自行到塲爲言詞辯論但以得法院之許可者爲限第四百條判决書内之事實及理由得祇記明要領江蘇高等法院第二分院刑事判决費阿仁因侵占一案上訴駁回工部局因徐大狗子等販賣鴉片一案原判决撤銷徐大狗子孫興順共同連續運輸鴉片各處有期徒刑一年併科罰金二千元裁判確定前關押日數以二日抵徒刑一日發票四紙信封一封没收卞榮良因强盜一案原判决關於卞榮良罪刑部分撤銷卞榮良連續强盜處有期徒刑十年裁判確定前覊押數以二日抵徒刑一日工部局因張錦榮故買贓物一案上訴駁回陳小弟因搶奪一案上訴駁回刑事裁定莊周氏等因莊慶生妨害風化一案聲請駁回工部局因惲蕙芳殺人未遂嫌疑抗告一案抗告駁回民事判决和記煤號與中興祥記煤礦公司請求捐害賠償上訴更審一案原判决變更被上訴人不履行契約對於上訴人因此所受之損害應負賠償責任第一二兩審及前第三審訴訟費用由被上訴人負担李丁氏與瑞昌祥號欠租及遷讓房屋上訴一案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担僧化響與周子桐遷讓房屋及租金上訴一案上訴及附帶上訴均駁回第二審訴訟費用由兩造各自負担史宗堂與上海信遠烟草有限公司保證債務上訴一案上訴駁回第二審訟費用由上訴人負担被上訴人假執行之聲請駁回遠東號主錢文祺等與中國營業公司欠租上訴案上訴駁回第三審訴訟費用由上訴人等比例負担茅裕生與愼昌洋行貨欵上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担柏賚士與張中虚貨欵上訴案原判决除令被上訴人應償還上訴人貨欵銀七千四百七十六元三角六分外變更被上訴人應就上開貨欵數額加給自民國二十年二月一日起至執行終了日止週年五厘之利息上訴人其餘上訴暨被上訴人附帶上訴及其在第一審之反訴均駁回第一第二兩審訴訟費用由被上訴人負担三分之二餘由上訴人負担楊培春與源大紗廠賠償上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担蔡全福與沈老三欠欵上訴案原判决關於令上訴人償還借欵三百元本息及令上訴人負担訟費部分變更被上訴人關於前項之訴駁回第二審訴訟費用及第一審令上訴人負担部分之訟費均由被上訴人負担薛鎭南與趙文宗請求撤銷代理行爲上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担民事裁定和豐綢莊與陳增耀貨欵杭告案抗告駁回批告費用抗告人負担葉夑唐與黃可銘欵項上訴案上訴駁回第三審訴訟費用由上訴人負担上海第一特區地方法院刑事判决周福祥對於公務員依法執行職務時實施强暴處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前覊押日數抵以二日抵徒刑一日周朱氏部分不受理林阿四搶奪他人所有物處有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日魏永生意圖營利以館舍供人吸食鴉片處有期徒刑一年併科罰金六十元徐梅生甯明德張仇氏吸食鴉片各處有期徒刑二月併科罰金二十元徐梅生張仇氏各緩刑二年裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日陳生金意圖營利以館舍供人吸食鴉之片代用品累犯處有期徒刑一年六月併科罰金六十元時瑞生邯愛生周福清俞阿二陸福元吸食鴉片之代用品各處有期徒刑一月併科罰金二十元劉長林吸食鴉片之代用品處有期徒刑二月併罰金二十元張阿毛沈伯英吸食鴉片之代用品累犯處有期徒刑三月併科罰金二十元曹子清吸食鴉片之代用品累犯處有期徒刑四月併科罰金三十元裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日馬金子搶奪他人所有物處有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵刑一日沈禁氏訴吴忠良妨害家庭及吴忠良反訴誣告案本件不受理俞張氏有夫之婦與人通姦一罪處有期徒四月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日孫成荃無罪王慶太累犯共同傷害人一罪處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日李阿五累犯竊盜一罪處有期徒刑四月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日黃槐生訴謝世煌背信侵占案本件不受理黃金表持有軍用手槍一罪處有期徒刑一年共同强盜一罪處有期徒刑七年應執行有期徒刑七年六月蘇龍表共同强盜一罪處有期徒刑七年裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日李瑞卿無罪手槍一支子彈六粒彈壳一只没收鄭育生等訴鮑世其傷害案本件不受理趙姜氏持有軍用槍砲徐阿二帮助持有軍用槍砲各處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日盒子砲一支没收沈才郎共同意圖營利以館舍供人吸食鴉片累犯一罪處有期徒刑一年併科罰金一百元高金郎范財元劉培卿汪長才張寳全吸食鴉片一罪各處有期徒刑一月併科罰金三十元張文秀吸食鴉片累犯一罪處有期徒刑二月併科罰金四十元裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日陸阿毛無罪王阿福搶奪他人所有物處有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日民事判决昌生進出口行經理劉樹棠與祥昌綢廠廠王施少初定貨案被告應給付原告貨銀二萬四千九百六十七兩六錢七分並自本年六月十一日起至執行終了日止週息七釐之利息及保險棧租費用將所定之毛綫五十包出清訟費由被告負擔愼興經租賬房徐志華與强珍和欠租遷讓案被告應償還原告洋三百零五元遷讓出屋原告對於被告屋内所置之勳産有留置權訟費由被告負擔本件關於遷讓部分准予假執行顧岳泉與周蕙珍確認離婚契約案確認兩遇於本年六月九日所訂之離異筆據爲有效訟費由被告負擔范陸氏等與黃根記租地案被告所造坐落上邑二十七係一圖念字圩即公共租界大通洛梅興里之房屋應即拆去將其地交與原告收回並賠償原告自本年四月七日起至執行終了之日止按年六百元之租金原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由原告與被告平均負擔沈炳康與周星榮等借欵案被告周星榮忻昌隆應連帶償還原告付欵洋三百元併自付欵星榮忻昌隆之財産不足清償時由被告方桂山代負清償責任訴訟費用由被告周星榮忻昌隆連帶負擔六分之五被告方桂山負擔六分之一黃潔如等與私立澄衷學校校董葉賢剛賠償案原告之訴駁回訟費由原告負擔惠興公司陳祖惠與麻逹司篤夫欠租及遷讓案被告應償還原告租金九百七十八兩二錢五分並應遷讓出屋關於遷讓部分宣示假執行原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告負擔中華勸工银行地産部與大成號渊怡之等欠租案被告大成號主潘怡之應償還原告洋一百三十六元小洋二十四角被告林家欽應償還原告洋一百三十六元小洋二十四角被告王道榮應償還原告洋三百六十元小洋三十六角原告貨餘之訴駁回訟費由原告負擔二分之一外餘由被告等比例負擔和泰公司經理傅兆豐與沈剔邨欠租及遷讓房屋案被原應償還原告洋六百八十元原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由兩造各自負担豫成專銷鄱樂産煤公司與鄱樂煤礦公司等債務案被告鄱樂煤礦公司應償還原告洋十三萬三千五百七十八元八分八釐並自民國十八年三月起至執行終了日止週年五釐之利息如不能償還時應由被告查澤丞謝天錫連帶代爲償還訴訟費用由被告鄱樂煤礦公司負担陳志良與金慶福欠租及電燈押柜案被告應償還原告房租洋二百一十洋原告其餘之訴駁回訟費原告負担十分之一被告負担十分之九朱維記經租處與林姓即林阿根欠租及遷讓案被告應償還原告房租洋二百八十元原告其餘之訴及假執行之聲請均駁回訟費原告負担九分之三被告負担九分之七茂隆洋行鮑騰訴大昌號等定貨案被告應連帶償還銀一萬零三百二十六兩六錢八分並自二十年十一月十八日起至付欵時止常年八釐之利秘又損失銀五千五百十四兩二錢一分訴訟費用由被告等連帶負担鄭勝廣與鄭才寳賠償損害案原告之訴駁回訴費用由原告負担海華春號康炳森與美生照相公司陳仲文等欠租及賠償案被告陳仲文銀福成應償還原

<p>The second extraordinary session of the Saito Cabinet convened yesterday. The opening ceremony was held today. Tomorrow, the election of chairpersons for all committees and standing committee members will begin. The main topics of discussion in this parliament will undoubtedly be the three issues of the Northeast, the League of Nations, and relief for farmers, rural communities, and small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises. However, with the various factions standing in rigid opposition, the atmosphere in the parliament is certain to turn treacherous after the government's policy address in the coming days. There is little doubt of this. Currently, the distribution of factions in the Japanese House of Representatives is as follows: the Seiyukai holds 298 seats, the Minseito holds 122 seats, and the Kokumin Domei holds 30 seats. Based on today's situation, the Minseito, which is considered a quasi-party, generally advocates maintaining the status quo of the current government and does not desire to rashly attempt political movements. However, if we consider the Seiyukai and the Kokumin Domei, which are in the opposition, it can be asserted that they will launch extreme attacks on the government. Recently, within the Seiyukai, there has been a division between the moderate faction, such as Suzuki, and the hard-line faction, such as Mori Kaku, with the latter gaining more influence than the former. According to Tokyo news, the challenges from the hard-line faction of the Seiyukai seem to be focused on economic issues, severely criticizing the government for failing to implement the currency expansion and debt consolidation resolutions passed in the previous 62nd parliament, and denouncing the government's budget as insincere. However, their ultimate goal is simply to seize power by exploiting the economic shortcomings of the current government. As for the Kokumin Domei (organized by Adachi after leaving the Minseito), its attitude towards the parliament is also dissatisfaction with all measures taken by the current government, and it has proposed six emergency countermeasures to counter the government's slow and insufficient relief efforts to save the current extraordinary situation. In addition, the proletarian parties focus on improving the lives of citizens (Social Democratic Party) or nationalizing the rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia (National Socialist Labor Alliance). In short, this is today's internal situation in Japan.</p>

<p>Guangzhou: The Guangzhou authorities have now decided to organize a strong air force.

<p>When the Songhua River flows through Harbin, it seems to have slightly changed its course. The river water strongly impacts the left bank of Harbin, so at a dangerous angle, it impacts the large bridge that the Chinese Eastern Railway passes over. The bridge foundations have been weakened by the mountain floods. The railway bureau has carried out several projects to add stones to reinforce the foundations, but the river water is very strong, so the bridge is in danger of collapsing at any time. The Songhua River water level has not risen today, but the water level in the territory of Blistan is still rising slightly. According to the opinions of experts who investigated the flood, the foundations of most of the houses in Fuchiadian have been destroyed, and they will not be able to be repaired in the future after the water recedes.

<p>Eagerly Awaiting the League of Nations General Assembly to Discuss the East Asian Issue</p>
<p>Political Circles Engaging in Great Preparations</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd: With the Ottawa Conference now open, public attention has refocused on the Far East and is eagerly awaiting the League of Nations General Assembly to begin discussing the Manchurian issue. London political circles are silent on this matter, but are engaging in great preparations. The British delegation will recruit many knowledgeable advisors. Sir Miles Lampson, the British Ambassador to China, who is currently on leave in England, will also be consulted and will undoubtedly be of great benefit. According to non-official sources, the public is very anxious about the outcome of the Geneva discussions, as Britain's trade with the Far East is very important, and any obstruction would be a major blow to British export merchants. Part of the business community has been dissatisfied with the evolution of events in Shanghai, especially the anti-foreign movement and China's demands for the abolition of extraterritoriality. They believe that although the Chinese are currently engaged in anti-Japanese activities, they targeted Great Britain as their target a few years ago and fear that once anti-Japanese sentiments succeed, they will turn to anti-British sentiments. Another part of the business community, as well as a large number of politicians from the Labor and Liberal parties, fear that the establishment of [Manchukuo] will affect British commerce, as the [Manchukuo] government, once it manages the customs of the three northeastern provinces, will definitely discriminate against British merchants.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 23rd: The extremely difficult situation facing the German Papen government is rapidly developing, due to the death sentence handed down by the Court of Buchen in Silesia to five National Socialists for shooting a Communist. The five have received a telegram from National Socialist leader Hitler, promising assistance, which is tantamount to saying that if the death sentences are not commuted, the National Socialist Party will openly declare war on the central government. Hitler's telegram said, "Comrades, I feel obligated to assist you for the sake of absolute honor in this abominable verdict. Your freedom is a matter of our honor, and it is our responsibility to fight against the government that caused this." At the same time, it is heard that Hitler is rushing to Berlin to confront Prime Minister Papen, explaining the necessity of pardoning the five National Socialists. The authorities have not yet issued a statement, but most newspapers advocate commuting the death sentence. One newspaper stated that the government promulgated an emergency decree to stop this kind of violence, and now the government must either commute the death sentence and abolish the emergency decree or risk the National Socialist Party causing internal strife, one of the two must be chosen.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: In Buchen, Silesia, Germany, five National Socialists were found guilty of murdering a Communist and were sentenced to death by the court. The National Socialist Party was greatly agitated and surrounded the court, demanding the release of the arrested persons. The police then fired warning shots to disperse the crowd. Many of the court's windows were broken, and the shops in the town were closed for fear of riots. It was found that the five who were sentenced to death broke into a Communist's house, severely beat him, and then shot him to death. This is the first time that a court has sentenced a terrorist to death since the promulgation of the emergency decree prohibiting political violence in Germany. After the verdict in this case, no appeals are allowed.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 23rd: Hitler telegraphed the five members of his party who were sentenced to death by the Buchen court, not only comforting them but also saying, "Your restoration of freedom has become a matter of honor, and it is our responsibility to fight against the government that issued this verdict."</p>

<p>Related to the Issue of War Debts, British Debt to the United States Due</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd: The trip of Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, to the United States has aroused comments from all sides. It is said that Norman's trip is related to the imminent expiration of Britain's war debt to the United States. According to an agreement between Britain and the United States, Britain may postpone payment of its debts for two years by notifying the United States ninety days before the due date. This postponement applies only to the principal of the war debt (i.e., 31 million US dollars), and the interest due must still be paid. According to the above regulations, Britain must notify the United States by September 15 at the latest. According to sources close to the British Treasury, Norman is deeply interested in the current financial situation of the United States, so he is going to the Americas to study it on the spot. After Norman arrives in the United States, he will contact the local banking community and may discuss the war debt issue as a result, but he has not assumed any formal mission in this regard.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd: Of the 200 million borrowed by the British Treasury last August, only 50 million remains outstanding. According to today's news, this sum is due on the 27th of this month and will be repaid when due without the need for extension.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Professor Piccard's Report on High-Altitude Exploration <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Brussels, Belgium, 22nd: The Belgian Scientific Research Foundation recently received Professor Piccard's preliminary report on his ascent into space. It first describes the preparations and then states, "The weather report for August 17 indicated that the weather was good, so it was decided to depart the next day. The inflation of the balloon proceeded as usual, and the departure was considered excellent. The weight of the balloon was made uniformly balanced by various methods, so it was necessary to drop sandbags later to accelerate the balloon's ascent. We then stretched out the wireless telephone mast and verified whether the ropes tying the basket were secure. When the balloon rose to a height of 1,500 meters, the exit of the cabin was closed. During the ascent, the air pressure in the cabin was always equal to the air pressure at a height of 2,000 meters. All the instruments for measuring cosmic radiation and the wireless telephone were used without damage. All the telegrams we sent were received, and the replies were also prompt. However, the measurement work was extremely difficult due to the freezing weather in the upper atmosphere. The temperature in the cabin dropped to freezing point or as low as minus fifteen degrees Celsius. From 10:00 am to 11:30 am, the balloon reached its maximum height. At that time, the air pressure was approximately equal to the pressure of 73 millibars of mercury in the barometer. Afterwards, when the balloon descended, the vent was tightly closed, and everything was normal, and the descent was considered good. The air pressure in the cabin gradually returned to the air pressure at an altitude of 4,000 meters. When it descended to 4,000 meters, the exits of the cabin were opened. When it landed, the suspended basket only rolled a few meters, and some instruments were broken as a result, but it was not a major problem." The scientific results of this ascent were also telegraphed to Brussels, but the telegram has not yet been opened.</p>
<p>Havas, Chiavenna, Italy, 22nd: Professor Piccard and his party arrived at Chiavenna, on the border between Italy and Switzerland, at 7:00 pm. Residents along the road from Lugano to Chiavenna hung flags and decorations to welcome them. To avoid the crowds, Professor Piccard left Lugano without stopping.</p>

<p>Havas, Manchester, 22nd - The general strike of Lancashire weaving workers this Saturday seems unavoidable. A union leader stated that, "Judging from the attitude of the representatives in the weavers' meeting, it is evident that many will respond to the strike. The situation of this struggle will definitely be very intense. Once the strike is launched, it is impossible to prevent the struggle."

The municipal authorities here are still trying to avoid the strike, inviting representatives from both labor and capital to meet on Wednesday to study whether it is possible for both parties to reopen negotiations. People in the weaving industry believe that workers' representatives will agree to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 22nd - The liquidation committee of the Kreuger &amp; Toll match company has decided that the continued operation of the Swedish Match Company is beneficial to creditors and shareholders and can be revived in the future. Therefore, it is proposed to maintain a share capital of 90 million kronor. All those with debt relationships can extend the current suspension of cash payment method for three months from August 30th. Currently, the only representative who has not agreed to sign the draft agreement with the liquidation committee is the representative of the American bank. The American bank is the creditor for 5% of the company's debt, and its representative requested time to consider the matter. The liquidation committee's reorganization plan advocates that the bank grant the company the necessary time to repay the debt, and during this time, principal and interest can be paid, but the payment of principal must depend on the company's annual profit. The company's balance sheet states that the company's current assets are not far from the company's debts. All foreign bonds of the company are calculated at today's market price, and the value of monopolies and intangible assets has not been calculated. The liquidation committee believes that the maintenance of a share capital of 90 million kronor is necessary, but it should not be regarded as the committee's opinion on the value of the company's stock. The company will reorganize a special committee to study the possibility of separating the company's industrial and financial businesses. The liquidation committee stated that the company's profits will be used to repay the company's debts and reorganize its business within a few years.</p>

The two women, one Mrs. Marcellus and the other Mrs. Hutton, stayed in the air for a total of 196 hours, exceeding the previous women's endurance flight record by 73 hours. This flight is particularly amazing because Mrs. Marcellus felt unwell during the flight. Because Mrs. Marcellus suddenly felt pain in her waist after taking off, she used the radio to ask the doctor on the ground, who diagnosed appendicitis and asked Mrs. Marcellus to descend as soon as possible for treatment. However, Mrs. Marcellus refused, so during the days of flight, Mrs. Hutton had to take care of Mrs. Marcellus on the one hand, and drive the plane on the other. The plane, named "Flying Women's Boudoir," is now indeed used as a women's boudoir.</p>

<p>Preliminary Agreement Signed by Creditor Representatives</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm - Regarding the reorganization of the Swedish Match Company, a preliminary agreement has been reached after discussions between company officials, domestic and foreign creditor bank representatives, and representatives of the shareholders' protection committees of various countries. The agreement has been signed by the aforementioned related representatives, except for the representative of the American Bank, who hopes to have an additional period to study the issue. The American Bank represents 5% of the company's interests. The Reconstruction Committee believes that it is most beneficial for all creditors and company shareholders to keep the match company active. The committee believes that the company will definitely get out of the current predicament in the future. Representatives of various banks requested that the Match Company be given a necessary payment period, during which the company may pay interest and repay a portion of the principal according to its annual profits. The committee proposed reducing the company's share capital from 360 million crowns (Swedish currency) to 90 million crowns. After the company is reorganized, all profits will be used to repay debts and consolidate the company's position. The above agreement includes an outline of the company's industrial restructuring and a large-scale downsizing plan.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Two Factions in Japan on the Manchurian Issue: Pro-War and Pro-Peace <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Both Factions' Arguments are Very Firm</p>
<p>It is Not Yet Determined Who Will Win</p>
<p>Our Country Should Pay Close Attention to This</p>
<p>The Tokyo Yorozu Choho discusses Manchuria, saying: "Today, there is a major crisis hidden in the internal relations of Japan's financial world. Under the current economic structure, can we barely maintain the status quo? This is doubtful. Furthermore, from the perspective of external relations, it is even more worrying. What is worrying is that the global economy and the Manchurian issue, due to their impact, have greatly affected the domestic economy. Even if Japan's financial circles temporarily devise remedial measures, the outcome of the Manchurian issue will ultimately be considered a risk of setbacks and destruction. In this impoverished Japanese capitalist economy, only Manchuria can open up various difficulties, such as the supply of raw materials, the demand for products, and the migration of surplus population, all of which are Japan's path to survival. However, the Manchurian issue is not solely a relationship between Japan and Manchuria, but a problem involving China, the United States, Russia, and the League of Nations. It has the nature of a major international issue, and the difficulties of its complex problems cannot be fully explained in one sentence. In particular, it is difficult to predict how the current League of Nations investigation team will report to the League of Nations, and it is also unclear how the League of Nations Council will handle the investigation committee's report. However, based on Japan's current attitude towards China, Russia, the United States, and the League of Nations, the results may be unfavorable to Japan. At this time, our government and the public must have a major awareness. If the League of Nations Council makes a judgment unfavorable to Japan, what new situation will arise is a major issue for the future. The current poor state of the world economy is due to the harm of the World War. This is generally recognized by people from all countries, and the current powers, including Britain, the United States, Italy, and France, are all in a state of poverty. It is probably not a good thing to talk about starting a war. Here, current facts and past experiences have the labor of mutual restraint. However, it is difficult to assert that there will absolutely be no war. If the League of Nations Council opposes the resolution, can Japan, by starting a war with the United States and Russia, contend with the world in this international reform situation, based on Japan's position? Therefore, Manchuria and Japan, regarding how the new country is formed, is still a byproduct, and the disaster of war has already been conceived. If a war breaks out, what is the current level of our national economy? This is a major key to survival. Recently, public opinion in Japan has been divided into two types: (1) Recognize Manchukuo, fight to the death with the League of Nations, and if it is not as desired, do not hesitate to fight. This war must be united by the whole country, and temporarily try to maintain the current economic situation. (2) The current domestic economic conditions cannot withstand the pressure of foreign wars. We should avoid war, be willing to regard Manchuria as Chinese territory, and belong to Chinese suzerainty. This can ease the atmosphere of the League of Nations and gradually transform the structure of the national economy, so that it can withstand international wars in the future. The above two factions, regardless of the government and the public, stand against each other. In the future, it should be determined according to the direction of national sentiment. If the people tend to favor pro-war arguments, the government will advocate a tough stance. However, whether advocating war can achieve the goal of maintaining the economy is questionable. It is difficult for the whole country to unite to resist foreign enemies, and internal reform is a prerequisite. Regarding this point, I hope the people will pay close attention to it."</p>

<p>He Yingqin Returns to Nanchang to Command Military Affairs</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Lin and Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Weijing, Yu Youren, Wu Zhihui, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Chen Bijun, etc., gathered at Chiang's residence in Lushan several times to discuss and exchange opinions. As a result, Wang's resignation as President of the Executive Yuan was retained, but it is still unknown whether Wang is willing to withdraw his resignation. After Zhang Xueliang resigned as Director of the Pacification Headquarters, regarding the issue of military jurisdiction in the Northeast, it was unanimously agreed that at this time of strong neighbors pressing the border, it is not appropriate to make changes, and everything should remain as it was. The resignations of the various ministers were also unanimously retained to jointly overcome the crisis. In addition, regarding party affairs, it was decided to convene a plenary meeting in the near future to resolve all major current issues and decide on future policies. Regarding diplomacy, steps to be taken towards Russia and Japan and proposals for the League of Nations General Assembly were planned. Regarding military affairs, Chairman Chiang and Minister He gave detailed reports on the suppression of bandits. Comprehensive plans were also made for military resistance in Rehe and Yuguan in the future, the support of righteous armies outside the Guan, and the reorganization and distribution of troops after inspection. Most of the Central Committee members believe that during this difficult period, only unity and consolidation of the central government can save the country from danger. Now that the Central Committee members believe that everything is progressing smoothly, they only need to return to Nanjing to submit to the central government for approval and implementation, and the central government's relationship is important and cannot be without someone in charge for a day. Therefore, it was decided that on the 21st, they would return to Nanjing, Wuhan, Jiangxi, and Shanghai respectively. Central Committee member He Yingqin returned to the province to command military affairs due to the urgent matter of suppressing bandits. Today, after hearing the news that He and Xiong (Shihui) returned to the province from Lushan, people from all walks of life flocked across the river to Niuhang Station to welcome them. At 12:45 noon, He arrived with a radiant smile, nodded to the welcomers as a courtesy, and then walked off the train, heading straight to the headquarters to discuss bandit suppression plans with Chief of Staff He. According to those who accompanied He to the province, all the Central Committee members decided to leave Lushan today, with Chiang still returning to Wuhan and Wang and others returning to Nanjing. This meeting has new policies for suppressing the Reds and resisting Japan. The Red bandits Zhu, Mao, and Peng in southern Jiangxi have now suddenly left their lairs and are attacking north with all their strength. Commander-in-Chief He, in addition to secretly ordering the garrison to cut off their retreat from the bandit lair, also transferred large forces from Jiangsu and Anhui to Jiangxi. He will arrive in the province today or tomorrow. (August 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Progress of Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Bandit Nest of Xinji Will Be Resolved Under Siege</p>
<p>Implement the Joint Responsibility System and Execute Retreating Officers</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The military situation of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has taken a sharp turn for the better since the recovery of Qiliping in Huang'an. According to an official of a high-ranking military agency interviewed by the reporter, the two Red bandit forces of Xu Xiangqian and Ji Xun, entrenched in the border area of the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, have been cut off from all supplies since the National Army implemented a strict blockade. Their medical supplies, which were already extremely scarce, have become even more difficult to obtain. The wounded or infected bandits are almost waiting to die. In the battles of Huang'an and Qiliping, they resisted stubbornly and tried to fight desperately, but they were met head-on by the National Army, suffering heavy losses. Recently, the people in the bandit areas have felt grateful for the generous treatment of the National Army and have become aware, no longer being anesthetized by the Red bandits. Therefore, the internal forces of the Red bandits have gradually split. The National Army, seizing the opportunity, has advanced simultaneously from all directions in eastern Hubei, southern Henan, and western Anhui. Telegrams of victory have been pouring in in recent days. What can be recorded is: In western Anhui, the National Army front in that area stretches from Shuangqiu, Lu'an, and Huoshan to the south, covering several hundred miles. The deployment of forces is extremely strong. The Red bandits have been wary of this for a long time. As soon as they heard that the National Army was advancing, their main force moved from the Jihe Che'an area to the Dingjiaji Huoxingmiao area southwest of Lu'an in an attempt to resist. The National Army, having learned of the location of the Red bandit main force, ordered each column to attack from Huoqiu and Lu'an in separate routes, all with Dingjiaji and other places as coordinated attack targets. On the 18th, the First Column of the Left Route Army launched a fierce attack on the bandits in front of them in the Xiahedian and Hekouji areas, occupying the line of Wuyangji Quanxingji and Dougangji. When the bandit units fled south, they suffered heavy casualties due to the attack of the National Army's advance team, and countless military supplies were seized. On the same day, the units of the Second Column advancing westward fought fiercely with tens of thousands of bandits near Balipeng. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Dingjiaji, relying on the terrain to resist stubbornly. After several assaults by the National Army, advancing one after another, Dingjiaji was occupied by the National Army on the morning of the 18th. The remnants of the bandits fled in disarray towards Xujiaji and Qingliang Temple. The National Army followed closely and pursued, and captured both places on the afternoon of the 19th, killing and capturing many. The remaining bandits scrambled to cross the Jihe River and scattered in all directions, and are still being pursued. Dushanzhen Chufuo'an, west of Huoshan, was originally the old nest of the pseudo-Fourth Army. Later, because the National Army's advance into eastern Hubei made the situation critical, they went all out to support it, and sent the remnants of the pseudo-73rd Division, which had been defeated by the National Army in the Wuyangji area, and a brigade of the pseudo-75th Division to fill the defense in the south. Now, each unit of the National Army in western Anhui has sent teams to encircle and attack in separate routes. On the 21st, they occupied the nearby Nanyue Temple, and after another attack, they will be able to destroy their nest. In southern Henan and eastern Hubei, Liu Zhi led the columns to converge and attack, and after recovering Huang'an and Qiliping, they advanced separately to attack Xinji, the location of the bandit nest. On the 18th, they encountered 15,000 bandits on the line of Cao'ao and Fujiafan, and after a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, most of them were defeated, and many were captured. The remnants fled back to their old nest and held on. The National Army in southern Henan has pursued to the south of Huwan, approaching Xinji. Zhonggushan, 20 miles from Xinji, was reportedly captured by the National Army on the 19th. The barrier of the bandit nest has been lost and is under the control of the National Army. It can be resolved in a few days. The bandits in the Shangcheng area have been surrounded by the National Army, and all the key points have been captured. Recovery is imminent. The bandits in Luotian and Wushan in eastern Hubei are not large in number. Recently, they have been under pressure from the National Army, and their morale has been shaken. They seem to be fleeing north, probably fearing that the National Army in Macheng will intercept their backs and that there will be no way to retreat. It is reported that after Commander-in-Chief Chiang came to Hankou to supervise the suppression, rewards and punishments were clearly defined. He ordered each army to implement the joint responsibility system. Those who were wounded but did not retreat and those who were captured but did not surrender were given special rewards and</p>

<p>The Suzhou case of Li Shunmei being accused is opened for trial. Liu Yongtai from Yunnan, formerly the Zhejiang Provincial Governor during the Qing Dynasty, built the Suiyuan Garden on Jingde Road in Suzhou. Recently, he opened the Garden East Hotel, possessing immense wealth. His son, Liu Yuzhong, was seen with his mistress, Feng Dayuan, leaving the Da Guangming Theater in the North Bureau, by his legal wife, Li Shunmei. She confronted them and took them to the police station. Afterwards, Feng Dayuan immediately hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the local court accusing Li Shunmei and her daughter of defamation and assault. Yesterday (the 23rd), the trial opened at 10:00 AM in the criminal court. The audience was very crowded, especially with women. Judge Yang Yigu questioned all the parties involved: Feng Dayuan, Li Shunmei, Liu Zizhong, and Sun Caiyun. He then ordered the case to be closed for investigation, as not all witnesses were present. The court date will be announced after the witnesses come. Li Shunmei was released on bail.</p>
<p>Wuxi is strictly investigating troublemaking vagrant soldiers. The County Government held its 31st District Chief Meeting on the morning of the 21st. Chairman County Magistrate Chen reported that, according to provincial orders, many former soldiers were left along the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) railway line after the 19th Route Army was transferred to Fujian. He ordered strict investigation and apprehension. After consultation with Battalion Commander Wang of the stationed Wuxi Military Police, it was decided that any vagrant soldiers or militiamen causing trouble would be immediately arrested and handed over to the military police for severe punishment. Subsequently, Police Chief Wang Gong stated that there were few former soldiers of the 19th Route Army discovered in the urban area, but in the rural areas further from the city, there were inevitably small groups causing trouble. He requested that all districts pay attention and immediately notify the bureau for assistance if any unexpected actions occur.</p>

<p>Kunshan County Police Force captures bandits. Five miles away from Zhangpu Town, inside the Wusong River, there was a government salt boat anchored around 9:00 PM the night before. Alongside it was a customs patrol gunboat for protection. Suddenly, three bandit boats approached. Soldiers on the boat saw them, and deemed them suspicious, shouting for them to stop. The bandits immediately opened fire, and the soldiers returned fire. The remaining bandits went to the salt boat to rob it. When the two sides were exchanging fire, Wang Xu, the Chief of the Zhangpu Public Security Bureau, learned of the situation and immediately telegraphed the County Police Force. Captain Zhang received the report and immediately led a platoon of officers to suppress and capture the bandits. Four people were arrested on the spot: Chen Gangzi, Wang Fusheng (also known as Wang A’gen), Wang Xiaobao, and Ding Guangzhou, along with three bandit boats. The remaining bandits fled ashore. On the 22nd, the four bandits were handed over to the County Government for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Provincial Government thoroughly investigates the Zhang Zuochen case. Zhang Zuochen, the County Magistrate of Suqian, was previously accused by the County Party Committee and fellow villagers in Beijing to the Provincial Government for corruption, dereliction of duty, and negligence in preventing bandits. It is now heard that the Provincial Government has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter impartially.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Township Headman kidnapped and killed by bandits. Li Wenzao, the Township Headman of Yangjia Township in Shaobo, was previously kidnapped by bandits who sent a letter demanding 10,000 yuan for his ransom. Through the efforts of his neighbor, Shi Guilin, who negotiated a reduction according to the address provided by the bandits, and the preparation of a feast by Li's family to entertain them, the bandits insisted on the original amount and tied Shi up, hiding him in the cabin of the boat, separated from Li by only a plank. The next day, Li died. Shi managed to escape but has not yet dared to report to Li's family.</p>
<p>Gaoyou City's North Embankment collapses for more than twenty feet. The newly built Eastern Transport Embankment north of the Fulu Temple outside the North Gate of this county collapsed for more than twenty feet yesterday after a rainstorm due to impure soil quality and poor tamping work. The section chief in charge is currently working to repair it.</p>
<p>Nantong thoroughly investigates the accounts of the detention center. The account books of the Nantong County Court Detention Center for the previous year were submitted to the High Court for audit. Many suspicious points were discovered. President Lin has now ordered Chen Xianwen, the County Court President, to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<p>Dispute over the existence of Rural Police Bureaus in Rural Districts. Various sectors in Nantong believe that the rural public security bureaus have no real power and, due to the lack of a definite police fund, are disturbing the people instead of helping them. A proposal to abolish all rural public security bureaus was passed at the County Administrative Meeting. The County Government has submitted it to the province for approval. Currently, the police officers in the districts, whose interests are at stake, are expressing opposition and have also sent representatives to the province to petition.</p>
<p>Problems with the selection of the director of the relief center. Zhao Jianhua, the Director of the Nantong County Relief Center, was dismissed by the Civil Affairs Department and the County Government ordered the replacement of Xu Gengqi and Zong Weichuan but both firmly declined. Currently, the selection of the director is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Investigation into the ruler ditch murder case. Wang Zijian, who used to run a butcher shop east of the Confucius Temple outside the West Gate of this city, delivered payment for pigs to Zhang Changyong's house in the ruler ditch on the fifth of this month and did not return overnight. The next day, his body was found hanging on a tree in Zhang's backyard. His wife reported to the county for an examination. On the morning of the 20th, the County Government dispatched the newly appointed First District Chief, Ma Shaozhou, along with Zhang, the coroner, to conduct the examination. According to Zhang, the deceased was beaten before his death, which caused him to commit suicide by hanging himself. However, he was not originally hanging on this tree but was moved there after being discovered. In the afternoon, the deceased's mother and sister, the Hang Wang family, brought Zhang Changyong and his son to the County Government to complain. The County Government then dispatched Li Cheng, the trial judge, to open a court for interrogation. As a result, Zhang and his son were detained, pending the arrival and interrogation of Zhang's neighbors, Liu Songling, etc., to clarify the situation. They also ordered the Hang Wang family to quickly prepare a coffin for Wang's body.</p>
<p>The third batch of prisoners in Xiaoshan to be released under the amnesty will be registered. Since receiving the High Court's order to issue the amnesty decree and the recidivism prevention regulations, the Xiaoshan County Court has been registering prisoners in this county who are eligible for amnesty and commutation and reporting to the High Court for verification. The first batch released seven people, the second batch twenty-one people, and now there are more than twenty people in the third batch, and those with unexpired sentences will have their sentences reduced and be released. Once the registration is complete, it will be reviewed.</p>
<p>Night boat robbed, resulting in a loss of a thousand gold. The Shaocheng-to-Xixing night boat from Xiaoyangfan Bridge in Xiaoshan was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat with ten bandits on board around 7:00 PM on the 20th. They looted wildly, seizing twenty-seven silver dollars and four foreign letters, worth about fifty-two dollars, as well as white silk and satin, totaling over a thousand gold. They then encountered an approaching boat and the bandits boarded their original bandit boat and escaped.</p>
<p>Banditry rampant on the border of Shao and Xiao. In Tianle Township on the border of Shao and Xiao, bandits are gathering in groups, recently divided into several factions such as the God of Wealth Party and the Rifle Party. At night, secret sentries are densely deployed in the surrounding neighborhoods, creating a sense of insecurity. It is heard that the Gods of Wealth invited from Shimenkuang are all hiding in the mountains, and when the army goes to suppress them, they cannot be found. Even a dozen or so members of the local defense corps cannot get close.</p>
<p>The 7th Division and 19th Brigade of Hefei defeat the Kuang bandits. Since the military campaign to suppress the bandits in western Anhui began from the central, left, and right routes, recovering Liu'an and Huoqiu, it has pushed to the west bank of the Fen River. The first two steps of the work have been completed. However, due to excessive heat and the prevalence of epidemics, the attack was temporarily suspended. Now that autumn has arrived, the left-wing Liang Guanying unit has completed its deployment in the areas of Linshan, Congjiabu, and Qingshan and is about to launch the third step of the anti-Red campaign in conjunction with the other two routes. Unexpectedly, Kuang Xun, on the morning of the 17th, personally led the 75th Division of the 25th Army and three independent Red Guard Brigades to suddenly attack the 19th Brigade of the 7th Division in Guojiadian on the central route of the suppression army. The attack came fiercely. The brigade fought back bravely. At noon, the outcome was still undecided. The 19th Brigade then launched multiple bayonet charges with their broadswords, killing many bandits. By around 6:00 PM, the bandits were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed. It is estimated that over a thousand bandits were killed in this battle, and more than six hundred rifles were captured. The Third Army Commander Wang Jun opened a victory celebration in Hefei and telegraphed the front lines to commend the officers and soldiers of the 19th Brigade.</p>
<p>Special News on Education</p>
<p>National Physical Education Implementation Plan (Peach). The First National Physical Education Conference was declared closed on August 21st in the auditorium of the Capital's Lizhi Society. The results of the diligent discussions by experts in national physical education and other fields were systematically organized and summarized into the [National Physical Education Implementation Plan]. This plan, at the very least, can represent the general consensus and efforts of our country's physical education circles regarding physical education at the present time. Thus, these few words are written to respectfully wish for the realization of the plan and to offer some discussion. The most brilliant aspect of this plan is the determination of the status of traditional Chinese martial arts in physical education, correcting the past errors of blindly copying foreign physical education methods. This opens up a bright new path for the future of physical education in our country, which is a most fortunate thing. In recent years, the enthusiastic advocacy of Mr. Zhang Zhijiang and others, who have personally demonstrated, has been very commendable. [The Commercialization of Physical Education] is a characteristic of physical education in modern civilized countries, especially in the United States. Our country's physical education has imitated Europe and the United States, and its past achievements have mostly emphasized competitive sports. Schools often give special treatment to athletes. The plan states regarding the assessment of physical education: [Assessing individual performance in sports meets is only enough to promote individual progress. It is a mistake to use it as a standard for judging the overall physical education of schools and the public. Using it as a tool to promote the popularization of physical education in schools and the public is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. On the contrary, physical education assessment, which examines the physical education achievements of schools or urban populations, can promote the progress of physical education for the majority of the public and is a very reliable means of assessing physical education in schools or cities.] Thus, replacing [the commercialization of physical education] with [the popularization of physical education] is indeed one of the valuable aspects of this plan. Attaching schools to actual workplaces is most appropriate. This is advocated by emerging education. The plan proposes utilizing physical education schools near physical education fields in various places, such as establishing a National Physical Education College at the Central Physical Education Field. The planning is very good. If it can be implemented effectively, it will surely be highly effective. Physical education teaching in schools at all levels has traditionally been divided into required and elective courses. Typical curriculum arrangements are no longer valued by emerging education. How effective has the implementation of physical education courses been in the past? Is there no need for improvement in the future? This is the most crucial question for physical education implementation. The plan and proposals have not researched this. In addition, the plan provides very detailed regulations regarding physical education goals and a very complete administrative organization. However, there seems to be room for further discussion.</p>
<p>News has been received that the Ministry of Education is actively promoting physical education. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, in order to revitalize the national spirit, has been actively promoting physical education. He has expressed his commitment to implementing the resolutions of this National Physical Education Conference regarding various important physical education matters and has personally instructed the responsible department to pay close attention to their implementation. It is also heard that he is actively working on organizing a physical education committee and establishing a physical education inspectorate.</p>
<p>The Editorial and Translation Office of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau moves; the General Affairs Office remains in the Ministry of Education. After the establishment of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, it was internally divided into the General Affairs Office and the Editorial and Translation Office. Due to financial difficulties, it was unable to build the bureau's premises according to the original plan, so it continued to operate in the Ministry of Education. Now, because the premises of the former Editorial and Translation Office of the Ministry of Education are insufficient, it has borrowed office space from the Municipal Government's First Residential Area Management Office on Shanxi Road. It is scheduled to move the Editorial and Translation Office into the office on September 1st. The General Affairs Office will remain at the original address in the Ministry of Education. The new location of the Editorial and Translation Office is behind the Overseas Chinese Reception Center. The location is spacious and the air is fresh, making it very suitable for the residence of the editorial and translation staff.</p>

<p>Many tennis talents in Southeast Asia. Qiu Feihai loses twice to Xu Xinji. Qiu Zhen has traveled throughout the Malay Peninsula, invincible. He met Xu Xinji in Java and lost to him twice (1) 5-7, 0-6 (2) 9-7, 4-6, 2-6. Batavia Correspondence. Qiu Feihai, one of our country's famous tennis players, has traveled to Siam and the Malay Peninsula since leaving Shanghai. Wherever he goes, he tries his seemingly divinely assisted tennis racket, playing all over Southeast Asia. He has not encountered any opponents. His superb skills are evident here. Therefore, the author has paid considerable attention to every detail of Qiu's journey to the Southern wilderness. The details are described below: (1) In Siam, he defeated the Siamese national player, Wenliang. The score was 8-6. He departed from Penang, British Malaya, and had a friendly match with Mr. Wenliang, the top national player in Siam, on June 24. When two heroes meet, there are naturally many spectators. Qiu used his most cultivated and persistent competitive spirit in the arena of a nominally friendly match, but in reality, an international competition. He defeated the Siamese national player, Wenliang, by 10-8. According to the Siamese Chinese newspapers of the day, the match was described as follows: Mr. Qiu served first. He won the first game with four to one. Wenliang fought back in the second game. After a long period of mutual struggle, Qiu overcame him again. In the third game, Wenliang's courage temporarily increased. He used pressure to send the ball, showing great skill, and winning a game, making the score two to one. After serving again, Mr. Qiu showed his prowess again. He used his signature side ball skills and combined wisdom and courage, finally winning two games in a row, making the score four to one. At this time, Wenliang's courage broke out and he launched powerful attacks. Qiu was unable to cope for a time and was defeated in three games in a row, making the score four to four. At this point, the game was nearing its end. Qiu knew that the opponent's momentum was irreversible and braced himself. Wenliang became more and more courageous as he fought. The battle became fierce. Both sides had amazing performances, earning continuous cheers from the audience. As a result, Wenliang took the upper hand, making the score five to four. After re-serving, this game was the key to victory or defeat. All the audience was anxious for Qiu. Unexpectedly, Qiu was a veteran of many arenas. In this crisis, he remained calm and coped with it without panic. His steady and experienced ball control made it impossible for Wenliang to take advantage of the situation. Several times, he committed suicide. Qiu finally passed safely, making the score six to six. At this point, both sides briefly rested and switched courts to fight again. Wenliang's momentum was still strong. He intercepted the ball, pressured, advanced, and retreated in an orderly manner. His fierce ball control forced Qiu to take a defensive position temporarily. As a result, Wenliang won this game again. After continuing to serve, Mr. Qiu carefully attacked left and right. Wenliang ran back and forth to meet him and finally created a seven to seven tie in the final. At this point, Qiu became unusually energetic and pressed forward step by step. Wenliang was unable to do anything. Qiu won straight, taking the advantage with eight to seven. However, Wenliang also worked extremely hard. After a bitter battle, he again made it an eight to eight tie. The scores of the two sides chased each other, making it difficult to separate them. Mr. Qiu was rich in experience, mature, and prudent. Under this situation, he always used both wisdom and courage, and finally won by ten to eight. (2) In Perak, he defeated the local champion, Lin Zengqi, winning two games in a row without being an opponent. After concluding his journey in Siam, Qiu embarked on a longer and more distant journey, arriving in Perak in the Malay Peninsula. There, Qiu competed with Mr. Lin Zengqi, a famous tennis player in the local Chinese community (Mr. Lin was the runner-up in the 1930 Malayan tennis tournament. His ball skills are comparable to those of Lin Wangsu). He won by scores of six to one and six to two. In short, Qiu's journey to England and Siam was a victory everywhere except for the match with Mr. Lin Wangsu. He did not have a single opponent. (3) He easily won two games in a row in Bandung. The Dutch champion capitulated. Time passes quickly, but it finally brought our far-traveling man, Qiu Feihai, to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies on July 20th. Then, he went to Bandung, a famous scenic spot in Java, without stopping to compete. He met the local Dutch champion on July 23rd and 24th. It goes without saying that he won two games in a row. He was not Qiu's opponent. He ended the journey in Bandung with scores of six to four, six to four, and six to one, six to two, and received the fruits of victory. (4) He met an opponent in Java and lost twice to Xu Xinji. First battle 0-2. Here, the author wants to introduce a new Chinese hero, that is, the one Qiu met in his southern tour. This new hero's surname is Xu, his given name is Xinji. He is now 23 years old, a Javanese Chinese, tall and thin, and full of energy, like a tiger coming out of the mountain. He has won the championship of the 1930 Java Chinese-Western Tennis League. When Mr. Qiu ended his journey in Bandung and arrived in Tegal on July 27th, he met this man. However, he was defeated by Mr. Xu with scores of five to seven and zero to six. Since the news spread, the Chinese and foreign tennis circles have been shocked. Even the author himself was surprised and thought that Mr. Qiu's ball skills and experience would be defeated by a new young man. It was a pity that he could not fly there to see it. Later (July 28th) in Surakarta, they met again. Mr. Qiu seemed to have noticed the opponent's skills and won a game with a score of six to two. However, as it was already late, both sides agreed not to continue the</p>

<p>Local News: Two Bitterly Suffering Children See the Light of Day; Cruel Parents Each Imprisoned for Three Years; Motherless Child Gets a New Lease on Life</p>
<p>Ningbo native Dong Renbao, who worked as a newspaper vendor and lived in the back building of Wanshouchang Coffin Shop at 170-172 Meibai Road, engaged in the tailoring business. He married Guangdong Xiangshan woman Chen, who was exceptionally fierce and overbearing. He feared his wife and obeyed her in everything. She discriminated against Genfu, his son from his previous marriage, depriving him of sufficient food and warm clothing. Not only did Dong not reprimand her, but he also aided and abetted her, eventually locking Genfu with iron chains in a pile of wooden planks in the attic of the coffin shop for nearly two years. Recently, Detective Lu Gendi and Ding Baohua of the Xinzha Police Station discovered this and arrested Dong and Chen. Although Genfu was able to see the light of day again, his legs had lost the ability to move and his appearance was extremely emaciated. According to a diagnosis by a doctor at Renji Hospital, he needs three months of care before it can be determined whether he will be permanently disabled. Therefore, the First Special District Court ordered that the child be sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care, while Dong and the others are held for questioning. This was reported in detail in previous issues. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing of this case, which has been completely transformed. The two detectives, Lu and Ding, still brought the defendants and Genfu to the Second Tribunal of the First Special Court to await trial. Genfu's long hair had been shaved off by the Relief Association, leaving him with a bare scalp. His face had also become fairer, and the tattered and filthy black single shirt and trousers he wore had been replaced with clean ones by the Relief Association. However, his legs were still as soft as cotton and he was unable to stand. The officers carried him into the courtroom and allowed him to curl up on the floor. Judge Wu Tingqi frowned and shook his head. After Judge Wu Tingqi took his seat, he saw the child's condition and frowned and shook his head again. He then ordered a bailiff to carry him to the forensic office for a detailed examination. He was carried back after a while. It was reported that the forensic examination determined that the ligaments in both legs had contracted due to prolonged confinement, resulting in the loss of mobility. Whether this will lead to permanent disability will only be determined after a hundred days of recuperation. In addition to the legs, the abdomen also had latent diseases due to chronic malnourishment. Although his head, face, and limbs appeared bloated, this was a temporary phenomenon of emptiness after prolonged confinement.</p>
<p>Attempting to Accuse the Son of Theft</p>
<p>Judge Wu then began questioning. First, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the defendant had previously claimed that his son had repeatedly stolen items from others, and had been repeatedly warned without improvement, and was unable to pay compensation. Therefore, he had to resort to locking him up with chains. However, according to repeated investigations by the police, the child had only stolen gloves from a car once and was taken to the police station. Because the owner did not want to pursue the matter, Dong Renbao was called to the police station to take him back. If his son had repeatedly stolen, why didn't he say anything at that time? This shows that he is now trying to shirk responsibility by fabricating excuses. When questioned, Genfu admitted to stealing once. The defendants, Dong Renbao and Dong Chen, still claimed that the child was dedicated to stealing and could not be controlled, so they locked him up. Dong Chen even argued, claiming that Genfu had stolen from a certain family on a certain day, either clothing or hats, and that his father had repeatedly compensated, even pawning items. She insisted they could no longer tolerate it, so they locked him up. However, there was no evidence to support this. The police requested severe punishment. Judge Wu severely reprimanded the defendants, saying that they had no familial affection and were extremely cruel. Such cruel methods would not be tolerated even if applied to animals, let alone between father and son. He repeatedly sighed and ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer, Wang, then recounted all the tragic facts and circumstances of stepmothers abusing their stepchildren since ancient times, to prove the defendants Dong Renbao's and Chen's actions of abusing their son due to fear of his wife. He stated that in order to protect human rights and maintain humanity, they should be severely punished in accordance with Article 294 of the Criminal Code, to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>The Violent Woman Should Be Sanctioned</p>
<p>Because the defendant did not have a lawyer, the judge appointed Shen Xiaoxiang as his defense attorney. Lawyer Shen stated that this tragic case was purely orchestrated by Dong Chen, with complete evidence and established facts. Such a violent woman should be sanctioned by law and there is no justification for leniency. Therefore, he declared that he could not accept the defense for the woman's part. However, Dong Renbao helped abuse his son because he was forced by his wife's ferocity. Since Dong Chen was the culprit, Renbao was somewhat excusable, and he requested that he be treated with leniency. Judge Wu then pronounced the sentence: Dong Renbao and Dong Chen were both sentenced to three years of imprisonment for the crime of jointly using methods likely to cause injury to harm a person, and the chains and other items were confiscated. Dong Genfu was sent to the China Women and Children Relief Association to be cared for. Thus, this thirteen-year-old motherless child can be said to have escaped from the sea of suffering.</p>
<p>Strange Visitor at the Public Security Bureau Claims to Be a Communist Due to Poverty, Requests to See the Director for Relief</p>
<p>One afternoon, a strange visitor, around thirty years old and poorly dressed, arrived at the Municipal Public Security Bureau and requested to see the director to report confidential information. After being questioned by the information officer about his name, origin, and whether he had a business card, the strange visitor hesitated. Because he had no business card to present, he took out an old one, which read "Wu Jingnan" (whether this is his real name is unknown). The information officer considered him inappropriate and did not report him. The strange visitor left dejectedly. Unexpectedly, the strange visitor went to the Sixth District Headquarters and claimed to be a member of the Communist assassination squad, and had assassinated important figures. Because he repented and deeply knew that the Communists had lost all conscience, and he knew that his crimes were heinous, he came to surrender and report confidential information to atone for his past sins. After repeated questioning by Director Zhang, he remained steadfast. Because the case involved surrender, he was sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for interrogation yesterday. Under interrogation by the section, the defendant confessed that he was poor and bored, and wanted to see the director for relief. He was unable to see him, so he had no choice but to give false information at the Sixth District Headquarters, otherwise he would not be able to be interrogated by the bureau. The interrogator found that the defendant had committed this despicable act due to poverty and sent him to the Third Section's Relief Division for relief.</p>

Schmidt started in May 1930 from Hamburg, passing through Scandinavia and other parts of Europe before going to North Africa, passing through Morocco, Tunisia, Tripoli, Egypt, and other places before arriving in Asia's Palestine. He then took the route through Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, Arabia, India, Burma, Siam, and Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai. To save travel expenses, he mostly traveled on foot. He carried a large book with him, asking famous people from all over the world to sign it as a souvenir. He also carried a camera to take pictures of famous places. He plans a three-year journey, and after returning, he will write a new book based on his travels.</p>
<p>Major Kidnapping Case in Chuansha Town, Baoshan: Nine Members of a Family of Ten Kidnapped, One Shot</p>
<p>In the Bojiazuizi area, about three miles south of Chuansha Town in Baoshan County, the family of the late Li Jisheng (nicknamed "Foreigner"), who had some savings, became the target of bandits. Yesterday morning (23rd) around three o'clock, more than thirty bandits suddenly arrived, each carrying rifles, Mauser pistols, wooden clubs, short knives, and other weapons. They broke through the gate with huge stones and entered the house, kidnapping Li's wife Yan and four daughters-in-law, one daughter, one granddaughter, and son Li Pengming, a total of nine people. They also shot Li's younger brother Quanming, the bullet entering from his right waist. After the bandits kidnapped the people, they reorganized the team, called out names, and left. The injured Li Quanming was accompanied by someone to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus at three o'clock in the afternoon. After arriving in Shanghai, the Shanghai-Taicang company arranged to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. At that time, the bullet had not yet been removed, and his injury was quite serious, and there was a risk to his life. It is also learned that Bojiazuizi is close to the Fotou Sea estuary. When the bandits entered the estuary, there were four fishermen rolling fish in the estuary. Fearing that their plan would be leaked, the bandits first took the four fishermen to the boat and swayed on the sea. After the nine members of the Li family were kidnapped, the four fishermen were released and they left leisurely. Later, the Chuansha Town Security Corps arrived after hearing the news, but the bandits were gone. The victim has filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Mei Gengsheng Defrauds and Abuses His Niece, Sacrificing Her Life</p>
<p>After the Incident, Yinsheng Fled; Cohabitant Attempted to Extort Money</p>
<p>Ningbo native Mei Weiting, in his fifties, worked as a clerk in the Jiangdong Hotel on Xinkai River. Mei had a younger sister, currently twenty-seven years old, who was still unmarried. There was a fellow townsman named Mei Yinsheng, thirty-six years old, who ran a hardware store called Yiji Shenzhuang at No. 6 Cuihua Lane, Fuyou Road, Nanshi. His wife, Zhang, was the same age as Mei and had three daughters: the eldest, Meiyun, was sixteen years old; the second, Guiyun, was thirteen years old; and the youngest, Zhaoyun, was nine years old. Yinsheng and Zanting's sister developed a love affair from acquaintance and then a physical relationship from love. At that time, Yinsheng coaxed Mei's sister, saying that he had not yet married. Mei's sister thought she had someone to spend the rest of her life with and was overjoyed. Fearing that the family would block them after discovering the affair, they agreed to elope and lived together with Yinsheng at No. 8 Shunxin Lane, Laoshenfu Road, French Concession, living like a couple. However, good things are often difficult. This matter was discovered by Yinsheng's wife, Zhang, who was uncontrollably jealous. On the 19th of this month, she gathered many women to form a "women's army," marching mightily to the house at No. 8 Shunxin Lane, Laoshenfu Road. They broke into the bedroom, destroyed all the objects in the room, and scolded Mei's sister. The neighbors persuaded them to stop. Afterwards, Mei's sister was ashamed and angry. Seeing that Yinsheng had fled and had no way to complain, she immediately informed her brother Mei Zanting and told him the truth, saying that she was confused at the time and eloped with Yinsheng without notifying her brother. Now she deeply regretted it, but since things had come to this, she had no face to live in the world anymore. Therefore, she asked her brother to come here for the last meeting. Mei Zanting had been searching everywhere for his missing sister. Now that he saw his sister here, but fallen into such a state, he felt both sad and happy, and deeply hated Yinsheng for defrauding and abusing his niece, which was inhuman. He persuaded his sister and promised to come again the next day and find a way to negotiate with Mei Yinsheng. After Zanting left, his sister thought she had followed the wrong person and was so depressed that she hanged herself in the room that night. The next day (20th) afternoon, Zanting came to his sister's place as agreed, but the door was tightly closed and no one responded to his knocking. Knowing something was wrong, he immediately gathered four neighbors to force the door open. He saw his sister hanging high in the room, her body cold as ice, and she had been dead for a long time. Yinsheng had already fled and disappeared. Zanting immediately reported to the police. On the 21st, the court sent personnel to the scene to examine the body and determined that the deceased had hanged herself before death. The body was handed over to her brother for coffin burial. Around 8 p.m. the night before, Zanting was in the hotel when Lu Danru from Wuxing, who lived in the same house as his sister, suddenly came with his fellow townsmen Lu Jingming, Jiang Jiying, and Guo Wenjie, claiming to have important matters to discuss at a certain place. Zanting did not suspect anything and rashly followed them. They arrived at Mei Yinsheng's house at No. 6 Huacui Lane and loudly said, "We are detectives from the police station and have come to arrest Yinsheng." At that time, the neighbors in the lane were alarmed and came out to watch. The beat officer Sun Yuwang saw the situation and came to inquire. Lu Jingming immediately showed his card, saying, "I am an adjutant from a certain place, and I am here to arrest an important criminal. After arresting him, I will send him to your office." Officer Sun immediately returned to the Second Station of the First District to report. Chief Bao ordered Officer Sun to rush back to monitor. Officer Sun rushed back to the original place, but seeing that Yinsheng was not in the village, he dragged the village staff Zhang Xingsheng and Zhang Kun towards the French Concession of Xinkai River. Officer Sun immediately quickened his pace and caught up. When he reached the intersection of Minguo Road, he called the beat officer from that place and intercepted everyone and brought them back to the station. During the preliminary interrogation by the chief of the station, Mei Zanting explained the situation. Lu Danru confessed that he was forty-two years old and that Mei Yinsheng had killed someone's daughter and now refused to show his face. He and the deceased lived in the same house, and he was really upset when he saw this incident. Therefore, he specially invited friends Lu Jingming and others to come to reason with Yinsheng. Lu Jingming confessed that he was twenty-seven years old and lived at No. 30 Duojia Road, Santai Wharf. Jiang Jiying confessed that he was twenty-nine years old, a local, and lived at No. 2, Lane 105, South District Street. Guo Wenjie confessed that he was thirty-eight years old, from Changzhou, and lived at No. 7 Deshun Lane, Chezhan Road. The other confessions were the same as Lu's. Zhang Xingsheng and Zhang Kun both claimed that Lu and others came to the village to arrest our boss but did not find him, so they dragged us out. As for everything else, they did not know. Since Mei Yinsheng had illicit relations with Mei Zanting's sister, it had nothing to do with Lu and others. Now that they went to Yinsheng's village to reason with Yinsheng, there was no need to drag his village staff to the French Concession. It was obvious that there was an attempt to extort money by framing someone. It should be reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for thorough investigation and strict punishment.</p>

<p>Many Impoverished People in the Zhabei War Zone Receiving Congee</p>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Group, since the Social Affairs Bureau opened a congee distribution center on Xinyingpan, Liuying Road, on the 2nd of this month, has been providing congee to the impoverished people in the war zone for nearly a month. Every morning at 5 or 6 a.m., the impoverished people from various roads in the war zone go to the factory to receive congee. The number of elderly, weak, women, and children has increased to five or six thousand people. The factory has four stoves open to the east and west for congee distribution, which is still insufficient. The mayor has allocated another 3,000 yuan for congee distribution to maintain assistance. It has also been found that the names of farmers who are extremely poor in the villages of Baziqiao and Nijiabang in the war zone have been registered and rice tickets have been issued. Because there are many poor people in the Zhabei war zone, and the demand for rice is huge, the funds are feared to be exhausted. It has been requested to the Municipal Government and the War Zone Relief Committee for assistance. It is recently heard that Wang Binyan, the director of the group, is making every effort to find a solution.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association Re-election: Resolved to Oppose the Railway Department's Liability Transportation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association held its second election of committee members yesterday. Ninety representatives attended. Zhang Dafu of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Sheng Yudu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Sun Mingqi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting to supervise the election and deliver speeches. Chairman Cai Yukun reported on the association's work. Then, the election of seven executive committee members began. The elected were Gu Yuyi, Huang Zhifu, Xue Dafu, Chen Yuming, Shang Zuocheng, Lin Dizhou, and Cao Xinheng. The three alternate executive committee members were Yan Biquan, Quan Zixiang, and Chen Shide. The election of seven supervisory committee members was also held. The elected were Cai Yukun, He Xianggu, Xie Xilin, Wu Zisheng, Chen Weifang, Yao Zilun, and Guan Renshan. The two alternate supervisors were Zhou Yuting and Yang Heqing. Five standing committee members were elected from each other. The elected were Gu Qingyi, Chen Ziyi, Fang Yusheng, Zhu Yunzhang, and Shang Zuochen. Next, Gu Qingyi was elected as the chairman of the committee, and Cai Yukun was elected as the director of general affairs. After the election, the executive and supervisory committees met to discuss the new regulations on transportation liability promulgated by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway authorities. It was considered a clever way to establish a name and intend to be harsh. The transportation costs of the association's members have become burdensome. This liability transportation regulation will increase the cost again. How can our members bear it? Cai Yukun, He Xianggu, and He Quansheng were immediately requested to meet with the Transportation Association and ask them to send notices to various transshipment companies. If it is implemented on September 1, all shipments will be stopped. At the same time, a telegram will be sent to the Ministry of Railways to strive for cancellation. Members will be notified to rush to load all kinds of passengers and goods by the end of August. If it is implemented on September 1, all shipments will be stopped. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.</p>

On the evening of yesterday, at 8:30 p.m., they secretly went to the address and arrested Zheng, seizing a book of obscene spring palace pictures and taking him back to the police station. It was learned that there were still a large number of obscene pictures being printed by Zhu Wenkui of Huamei Printing House at No. 309 Xian Deli, Xizang Road. The detectives went to arrest Zhu but were unsuccessful. They only seized 1,000 obscene pictures (each with four photos) and 20,000 similar photos from Zhu's house at No. 641 Shanhai Pass Road. They took them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu interrogated them. The police lawyer said that according to Article 251 of the Criminal Code, such photos are most harmful to young people in society and should be severely punished as a warning. Detective Ruan then reported on the situation of the case and presented the pictures for inspection. When questioned, the defendant's confession was vague. Judge Wu reviewed the confession and sentenced the defendant to a fine of 800 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan.

<p>Such is Xianyang</p>
<p>Our inspection group to northern Shaanxi gathered in front of the Northwest Hotel at 9:30 AM on the 15th. We took cars to Sanyuan for inspection. As the cars started, dust billowed up again. Fortunately, the road was relatively flat at the beginning, so everyone didn't seem to mind. Soon, we reached the bank of the Wei River and saw the low, dilapidated walls of Xianyang city on the opposite bank. We couldn't help but sigh with regret. The Wei River was quite shallow and narrow, with the water flowing on the left side of the riverbed, only as wide as an ordinary stream. Where it was low and dry, there was no water, and the muddy soil was loose and difficult to walk on. Those crossing the river were first carried on the backs of camel drivers to the ferry. The reward they received was about ten to thirty copper coins per person each time. Once the ferry was full, it slowly started moving towards the opposite bank. The water flow in the Wei River was quite rapid, carrying a large amount of soil downstream. When it reached a flat area, the water flow slowed down slightly, and the sediment it carried settled at the bottom of the river. Continuing in this way, the riverbed became higher day by day, and the water flow was blocked and caused harm to the people. Although the buildings inside Xianyang city were not very crude, the scene was desolate. Looking back on the past, where is it now? In the city, besides the Wen Wang Temple and Zhang Yide Temple, there were no other ancient sites. Even the Afang Palace of Qin Shi Huang, where the emperors of the past competed in extravagance, was dozens of miles away from the city, with only a piece of yellow earth marking its ruins. The tombs of King Wen and King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty were located more than ten miles outside the city. There were more than ten stone tablets in front of each tomb, about as tall as a two-story Western-style building. Only a few sparse, withered green branches grew in front of them. The ground was bare, without any other plants. From here, the cars were difficult to drive due to the poor road conditions. After several tens of minutes, the road became wider again, but there were many bumps, and the shaking was so severe that it made people's heads spin. By the time we reached the Jing River at 2:30 PM, everyone's faces, eyes, and other parts of their bodies were covered by dust and dirt, almost turning into clay figures. The water flow in the Jing River seemed even more turbulent than that in the Wei River. Normally, the Jing River is clear and the Wei River is muddy, but on this day, the Jing River also carried a huge amount of yellow earth downstream. It could be said that the Jing and Wei rivers were indistinguishable. At 3:30 PM, the people and cars successively crossed to the other bank. We got back into the cars and continued towards Sanyuan. Along the way, we saw many jujube trees in one place, and a lot of cotton was also planted in the fields. Unfortunately, due to the lack of rainfall, it could not grow fully.</p>
<p>Around 5:30 PM, the cars arrived at Sanyuan. As we entered the city gate, representatives from various agencies were already waiting on the side of the road to greet us. Due to the temporary lack of suitable accommodation, we rested overnight in the county-run senior primary school. The school buildings were spacious. As soon as the team members arrived, they ordered servants to fetch water to wash away the dust, and the hospitality was very thoughtful. After 6:00 PM, the various political and business agencies of Sanyuan County hosted a banquet for us at the Mingde Pavilion Restaurant. At 9:00 PM, a welcoming party was held again at the school. On the morning of the 16th, County Magistrate Li and others planned to host another wash-the-dust banquet for us. We repeatedly declined, but to no avail, so we had to attend. However, Sanyuan has no mineral resources besides agricultural products. Therefore, in order to save time, Director Hu decided to depart at 8:00 AM that morning to Yao County, which is known for its coal, to conduct an inspection and perform statistical surveys.</p>
<p>We ultimately felt that statistical surveys were more practical and beneficial than empty, descriptive essays. For example, asking about the number of stamps sold by the local post office in a month can reveal the level of culture in that area. The same goes for other things. Therefore, as soon as we arrived at a slightly prosperous city, we asked shopkeepers about prices. As soon as we encountered farmers in the fields, we asked about the condition of agricultural products. If we encountered mining areas, many of the specialists brought machines and could perform tests as soon as they had the opportunity. In addition to oral inquiries, we could also obtain scientific proof. We believe that it is not very far from the word "inspection". Regarding Xianyang and Sanyuan, the results of our investigation during our short stay in the area are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Xianyang (Population): There are about 1,000 households in Xianyang city, with a total of about 3,000 people. The entire county has about 79,000 people. (Area): About 3 million acres. (Land Tax): Divided into three types: military, civilian, and royal. [Military] Land is divided into three types. The tax collected per acre per year is about 40 to 50 cents. [Civilian] Land is divided into five grades. The tax collected per acre per year is about 10 to 50 cents. [Royal Land is not graded. About 40 to 50 cents per acre per year]. The annual tax revenue is about 110,000 yuan. (Cotton Production): The entire county produces about 3 million catties of cotton per year, with a tax of 8 li per catty. (Coal Price): Yaozhou coal is 2.6 yuan per 100 catties, and Shanxi coal is 3 yuan per 100 catties. (Other): Rapeseed oil is 1.3 yuan per catty, cotton oil is 1.34 yuan per catty, kerosene is 6.7 yuan per barrel, and the daily wage for labor is 30 cents, or about 40 yuan per year.</p>
<p>(B) Sanyuan (Population): The entire county has more than 11,000 households, with a total of about 90,000 people. (Area): 6,720 acres. (Land Tax): About 90,000 yuan. (Agriculture and Forestry): (1) Trees include mulberry, elm, willow, pine, poplar, cypress, soapberry, and tung. (2) Fruits include peaches, plums, apricots, persimmons, dates, pears, forest fruits, pomegranates, grapes, and papayas. (3) Grains include wheat, barley, buckwheat, broad beans, soybeans, mung beans, sword beans, sesame, millet, corn, taro, and sorghum. (4) Melons include watermelon, pumpkin, winter melon, gourd, squash, loofah, and angled gourd. (5) Vegetables include scallions, chives, garlic, eggplant, chili peppers, cabbage, lettuce, alfalfa, radish, and mustard. (6) Medicinal Herbs include Bupleurum, Cyperus rotundus, Artemisia, Agaricus, dried tangerine peel, Plantago, Sophora japonica, and sour jujube kernels. (Special Products): (1) Cotton: The entire county plants about 2,200 acres of cotton each year, with an average yield of 40 catties per acre, resulting in 8.92 million catties of cotton per year. (2) Linen Cloth: The spinning and weaving of linen cloth using traditional methods is mostly done by Shandong merchants. Because there is no fixed market, the annual output cannot be calculated. (Animals): Animals include cattle, horses, etc. Birds include chickens, ducks, etc. There are only two types of fish: carp and silver carp. (Transportation): (1) The post office is a second-class institution with one postmaster, one assistant, three letter carriers, and eight mail carriers. It serves five locations: Xi'an, Yao County, Tongzhou, Gaoling, and Chunhua. Mail is delivered daily between Xi'an and Gaoling, and every two to three days to the other locations. The daily revenue from postage is several hundred yuan. The remittance fees are extremely high, with 13 cents per yuan for remittances outside the province and 5 cents per hundred yuan within the province. (2) Cars: A car departs from Xi'an to Sanyuan once a day at 6:00 AM. The fare used to be 3.6 yuan per passenger, but now it has been reduced to 1.8 yuan due to competition. The route used to pass through Xianyang and was 130 li long, but now it takes a different route that is only 90 li long. Each truck can carry 600 catties of goods, with a charge of 3 yuan to Xi'an. (Education): The entire county has five complete primary schools, more than 160 elementary schools, 30 people's schools, four reading rooms, one sports field, one library, and one people's library. In addition, there is one provincial middle school and two county-run middle schools, but they have recently been suspended due to crop failures. The annual revenue includes: (1) A special tax of about 3,600 yuan per year, accounting for 40%. (2) Operating expenses from the Finance Bureau and the Education Department, about 7,000 yuan per year. (3) Tuition fees, 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per year. School property rental fees are about 2,000 yuan. Each school accommodates about 200 to 300 students. Each elementary school has only one or two classrooms, while complete primary schools have more than ten classrooms. Each grade has about 50 students. The oldest students in the highest grade are about 16 or 17 years old. Primary schools also have kindergartens. Tuition is waived for higher primary schools, while lower primary schools charge 2 yuan per year. Teachers' salaries are 10 to 12 yuan per month for lower primary schools and 12 to 20 yuan per month for higher primary schools. The principal receives about 24 yuan, with lodging provided but not meals. In addition, the Catholic Church also runs one primary school, and the Christian Church runs two primary schools, each with about 60 to 70 students, all tuition-free. Textbooks from the Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company are used. English is taught from the first grade of higher primary school (i.e., the fifth year of complete primary school). The teachers employed are all from Shaanxi, both male and female.</p>
<p>Since the above two counties are not within the inspection area, I have briefly recorded their general conditions as above. We will be departing for Yao County at 8:00 AM this morning. Since there are no cars, the difficulties will be even greater. As I write this, I hear the sound of rain dripping outside. It started at 2:00 AM, but stopped after less than half an hour. Farmers who have been longing for rain may not be satisfied with this small amount of rain. (Morning of the 16th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence, Songjiang</p>

The counties should promptly appoint supplementary directors and send a letter to the local county magistrate, Shen Yong, for verification. We have learned that the county has appointed Cai Guangyao, Sheng Yuanyin, Zhang Baozhi, and Zhu Zhaosheng to succeed as directors, and appointment letters have been prepared and sent to each member. In addition, Chen Ren has been appointed as a director of Fengxian County, and Jin Yongliu has been appointed as a director of Qingpu. Chen Jiuyu has been appointed as a director of Chuansha. The county government has also sent letters of appointment.</p>
<p>A Jealous Murder Case in the Train Station Road Yesterday (23rd) at 8:52 AM, a passenger train from Shanghai arrived. Three female passengers, including Zhang Aibao, got off the train. While walking along the road, a man suddenly rushed out. The man, Hu Huayun from Yuhang, wielded an axe and a sharp knife, stabbing Zhang Aibao five times. When the man saw that he had caused trouble, he stabbed himself in the throat. However, the wound was shallow. A crowd quickly gathered and captured the assailant. A note written on the back of a cigarette pack was found on him, listing the names and addresses of the people he wanted to take revenge on. The reason for the attack was that Zhang Aibao had previously had a relationship with Hu Huayun. Zhang then changed to another lover, causing jealousy. It is reported that Hu is a carpenter. Knowing that Zhang would be arriving in Songjiang this morning, Hu came to Songjiang yesterday and stayed at the Mingli Inn. When the early train arrived in Songjiang, he was waiting on the road. The injured man and woman are currently being treated at Joseph's Hospital. The female passenger who accompanied them was taken back to the Public Security Bureau to be questioned and sent to the court for investigation.</p>
