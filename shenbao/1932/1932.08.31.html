<p>最近日本政府一面派武籐爲駐滿特使將與僞組織訂立所謂基本條約一面由内田外相代表軍閥之意旨在臨時議會顚倒是非强詞奪理作關於承認滿洲僞組織冗長之演說悍然不顧國聯大會屢次之决議不納國聯調查團在日本時所進之忠吿視九國公約如無物目非戰公約爲廢紙彼其咄咄逼人之態度直向全世界公理挑戰而不恤與種種平和之保障爲敵試問國聯與美國將置若罔聞不籌對策歟抑將亟籌有效之對策以與相抗歟此實關係東亞乃至世界安危之重大問題應爲吾人所嚴重注意者也</p>
<p>消息傳來調查團雖未正式表示意見但該團中人已非正式表示調查團之報吿　與其結論决不致受日方最近種種之影響而有所變更惟美國則尙守簡默未有表示按華盛頓電訊［無論如何在國聯調查團報吿書發表以前美國政府對於東北問題不至再發表宣言］是在美政府未有正式表示以前美國對日究採何種方策祗有猜測莫敢預言然細察過去與最近日美之關係美日邦交是否將由惡化而至於破裂殆瞭若觀火請略論之</p>
<p>以昔德皇威廉謂［朕之將來在海上］遂激起英倫島國之嫉忌後來英國卒與恊約國一致對德作戰良以島國最忌他人侵其海上之覇權以限制其帝國主義之發展日美關係其實亦復如是當美國林肯總統時代國務卿施華特曾言一美國之將來在太平洋］其後羅斯福總統亦言［能制太平洋者可握世界覇權］美日兩國爲爭太平洋覇權互相暗鬭由來已久原非一朝一夕之故一九Ｏ五年羅斯福調停日俄戰爭俄雖戰敗而未負賠欵義務日本所得之於俄者僅僅樺太島之南半部而已當時俄之外交雖甚巧妙而羅斯福爲太平洋上權利關係不欲袒日實爲日本犧牲大而所得良寡之一因自是以後美日關係日由貌合神離而趨於恶化矣</p>
<p>當一九一四年世界大戰之勃發也歐洲諸强紛紛捲入戰爭漩渦東亞均勢無暇兼顧斯時日本傲睨一切大有在東亞唯我獨尊之槪始以對德宣戰爲名出兵山東繼復利用袁氏之帝制自爲提出二十一條迫我承認其時美國以糧食軍火供給歐陸一躍而爲歐洲之債權者經濟發展一日千里日本雖亦趁火打刧工商業大盛國勢日旺卒以美國從中作梗對華侵略稍留餘地後來日本出兵西伯利亞美又多方制止其向巴喀爾進行並阻撓其乘機擴充在北滿之勢力美國處處壓抑日本使之不得爲所欲爲日本安得而不怨懟美國此外美國排斥有色移民取締日僑亦屢屢激起日本對美甚深之惡感其尤甚者日本甫於一九二三年遭地震巨災美國即於翌年實施排日移民法律日本朝野莫不痛憤某學者且嘗言日本欲維持一等國面目非與美國一戰不可</p>
<p>惟戰後各國人士因怵於戰爭之慘酷是以和平運動頗爲昻進深得各方之贊助美日共同簽字之九國公約非戰公約倫敦海軍協定皆由此和平運動之效果而爲世界和平之保障美國因有此保障在太平洋上遂不以斐律賓島爲海軍根據地其關島未完成之軍事設備亦不復進行詎日本反因美國疏於準備乃乘我水旱大災世界經濟恐慌之時將所有平和保障一律摧毁以武力爲萬能侵我東北我國上下固一致反對然美國又豈甘受日人之欺不顧其傳統政策而以太平洋上之權利拱手讓人乎是以除非美日内部革命根本改變其對外方策美日兩國之關係必由惡化而趨於破裂殆可斷言所不可知者何時破裂發生衝突耳關於破裂衝突之問題容續論之</p>

<p>對於大學訓育的蠡見</p>
<p>（續昨）　　　　邵嗚九</p>
<p>（二）打破抽象的訓育目標</p>
<p>說起大學的訓育目標、却是很重要的、因爲目標定得好的、就可造成一校很好的風氣、假定抽象的訓育目標、差不多是形式的、而非實際的、辦事人覺得實行困難、而學生方面、常常發現敷衍態度、據我平日所觀察一般大學的訓育結果、認爲有急需改進的必要、要定訓育目標、應該先把一校沿革、考察一下、並且要注意學生所處的環境、把事實做根據、然後參用各大學所訂相同的目標、取長補短、以便於實行、照這樣的計劃、才能不違背事實、和敎育原則的、也就能於無形之中、涵養科學的精神、達到科學訓練的目標、</p>
<p>（三）打破死板的訓育方法</p>
<p>以前大學的訓育方法、有的主張嚴格、有的主張放任、都是主觀太重、恐怕不能應用或適合大學的訓育方法、據我所明瞭大學生的情形、論自治能力和學識、都比中學生高、講到經騐呢、大學生都感覺缺乏、所以我們注意大學的訓育方法、那就比中學複雜的多了、我認爲訓育方法、要注意的、Ａ不宜多採用死板的條例辦法、都來監督學生、Ｂ要隨時隨地引起學生的興趣、Ｃ指導學生關於生活上需要的經騐、Ｄ指導員和學生應打成一片、使師生間眞正合作、效果更大、Ｅ希望造成大學生個個爲國家社會服務的全才、總之訓育方法是活的、不是死的、也許看學校情形和學生需要隨時改進罷了、</p>
<p>我不敢說上面三點意見、是天經地義、但是對於大學訓育問題根本上、總覺得有研究的必要、茲特略述所見、還要請當道賢達的指正、（完）</p>

<p>第十屆世界亞林匹克運動會、創人類莫大之會集、未及開幕、（下午三時）場内已容有十萬五千之觀衆、參加者四十七國、選手達二千以上、制服艶映、極地球上英武之壯觀、幕起時各國代表及男女選手入場、在跑道内沿外繞行一匝、五百員之大軍樂隊導領步代、（每分鐘一百十步）希臘國係大會之創造者、因推該國代表居游行之第一隊、其次卽挨國名第一字母之先後排行、美國隊以地主之誼居末位、每隊由一專員持國名旗前導、持國旗者隨之、相隔八步、隨後卽爲職員代表女選手而男選手、游行經司令臺前、各隊全體舉手示敬、美國四百餘人、整步如一、經過費時最長、游行畢、卽依次排列場内、合觀衆及選手、將運動場及看裏裝成肉體桶形、洵大觀焉、</p>
<h3 id="c129">壯麗之開幕典禮 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>各國代表整排旣畢、由大會主席邀請美國副總統柯立史正式宣告開幕、辭僅二十餘字、取省時也、辭畢、升旗舉火、奏大會歌樂、二千代表世界和平之輕氣球、飛揚滿場、砲鳴十響、示第十屆之意義、更有五千人組織之唱歌班、同聲高唱大會歌音、聲人雲霄禮畢、相繼排隊出場、秩序井然、僅費二小時、此却不得不欽慕此次籌備佈置之有方、整肅迅捷、可稱完美、</p>
<h3 id="c130">周到異常之會場佈置 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>看臺坐位、俱編定號數、入場進口、共有兩處、觀衆雖多、却無擠軋等象、場内外各處、除應有軍警站崗外、尙有穿制服之大學生隨處維持秩序、放聲器搆造轉佳、發音十分宏亮、卽看臺遠處之高角上、亦能清晰無遺、演說者多人、辭俱簡捷、</p>
<h3 id="c131">各國注目中華代表團 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>由大會專派持國名旗者前行、劉長春舉國旗、余任總代表繼之、隨後代表四員卽宋君復·劉雪松·申國權·托平、代表團共六人、然其他較小中華之代表團者亦有之、我國雖係初次參加、然頗引起各國人仕之注目、舊金山總領事黃博士偕其夫人、踞坐名譽席上、參與開幕盛典、是故我國此次以少數这代表加入、而能與世界各國在大會中獲同等之榮譽、良可慰焉、</p>
<p>（劉長春於第十屆世界運動會中二百米預賽奮鬥之情形</p>
<p>上影爲二百米預賽、將達終點之情形、跑第四路者第一、卽美國墨托加夫、跑第一路者第二、爲加拿大拉愛德、跑第三路者第三、爲新西蘭普拉克、跑第二路者卽劉長春屈居第四、然觀照片、相差甚微、足徵劉君之努力、（宋君復自洛杉磯寄））</p>

<p>劉長春係我國參加世界運動會選手第一人、百米列入預選第二組、起步甚佳、前領至五十米之遥、因豋陸僅二日、缺少練習、故在最後之五十米中、不能保持原有位置、致被後來者追出、獲第四名、（同組共六人）第二日二百米預賽獲第四名、出發欠佳、致追隨不及、因失複賽資格、以劉君平日成績觀之、此次在大會中殊極力奮鬥、若能身體較健、當可得優良之表演也、</p>

<p>草地網球會之高級單打初賽、昨日鄭兆佳對屠開元、林寶華對派來托、均在中華網球場比賽、結果鄭以六比三、六比三、六比一勝屠、林對派來托因開始較遲、遇傾盆大雨、未能結束、已得比數爲六對一、六對三、三比二、林佔優、</p>
<p>鄭屠之戰、頗多精采、鄭之正反抽擊、猛銳準確、鮮有失誤、屠之表演、特别謹愼、每有傑作、故競爭興趣、頗爲濃厚、</p>
<p>林寶華因脚傷未愈、不善奔跑、僅以遠近巧妙之球制勝、對手球藝、尙有可觀、亦時有良好表演</p>

<h3 id="c141">日第三艦隊集中說日領白井否認 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>時聞社云、自駐滬日陸戰隊司令杉坂、兩次發出安僑佈吿及宣言後、本市人心、又復深感不安、且日來報載日海軍省令飭第三艦隊、集中上海、對我示威、曁日軍在滬西一帶、敷設軍用電話之消息、以致謡諑益盛、閘北居民、一夕數驚、時聞社記者、爲求明瞭實况起見、昨特驅車往訪駐滬日副領白井於日總領事署、詢以各項詳情、茲誌其談話如下、</p>
<p>▲否認第三艦隊集中上海　據日副領白井對時聞社記者談、第三艦隊之來滬期、係在一二八戰局發生以後、蓋一二八以前、日本在華海軍、僅有第一第二兩遣外艦隊、迨事變發生、海軍省恐駐滬海軍軍力不足、乃調派第三艦隊、由左近司中將率領來滬、同時海軍省特授左近司中將以全權、指揮統率第一第二兩遣外艦隊、即奉令開赴長江·青島·華北·一帶駐防、左近司抵滬後、爲檢閱該兩外遣艦内部起見、曾於八月初、乘出雲旗艦出發、檢閱所部、迄今已逾兼旬、任務業將吿終、故左近司已由漢啓程返滬、明後日可望抵埠、外傅日海軍省有電令第三艦隊集中上海、對華示威一節、予（白井自稱）實並無所聞、惟左近司職任駐滬海軍司令、檢閱軍艦、自屬分内事、故左近司返滬後、或將在滬舉行駐滬艦隊總檢閱、亦未可知、但敢負責聲明、决與時局無關、至於第三艦隊所屬軍艦、已陸續開滬云云、事實上並不完全確實、外傳種種、不可深信</p>
<p>▲敷設電話爲求便利通報　關於近日日軍在滬西一帶、敷設軍用電話問題、其主要原因、爲求便利通報、並未含絲毫軍事作用、白井談至此、記者即向彼質詢曰、君之所謂通報、但不知係指何項性質之電報、白井思之良久、遽答曰、軍用電報耳、記者即再質之曰、君旣承認上海决無危險事件發生、則敷設軍用電綫、至少有犯對華示威之嫌疑、白井乃莞爾而答曰、此係海軍當局所爲、非予所當知也、</p>
<p>▲軍隊調防係屬事之常理　白井又聲稱、日駐滬陸戰隊、其能力已足保障僑民之安全、决無再行增派來滬之必要、外傳將有五百名調滬之說、似不可深信、蓋駐外軍隊之調動、本係事之常理、故駐滬日軍之時來時往、純係調防性質、如今日來五百名、明日即去五百名、交相瓜代、於數目上、並無增加、前數日雖曾有陸戰隊三百名到滬、但隔日即有三百名乘寳戶旗艦歸國、此即明證也云云、</p>
<p>▲日陸戰隊日内確將到滬　記者與日副領白井作畢上列之談話後、當即興辭而出、復赴日軍事機關、作詳密之調查、始得悉在最近三日内、日陸戰隊、確有三百餘名、陸續來滬、且此來並非與滬上駐軍瓜代、至於第三艦隊所屬軍艦、亦有悉數開滬集中、俾便左近司總檢閱之傳說、</p>
<p>▲虹口一帶日軍梭巡仍嚴　當記者緩步歸來、經過虹口北四川路一帶日僑居住區域時、數見日陸戰隊、全副武裝、往來梭巡、並見有機槍一隊、向東疾馳而去、日浪人所組織之日警團、亦復發現不少、各日商號門首、均站有該團團員一人、以資保護云、</p>
<h3 id="c142">日方所傳滬埠治安消息 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>日軍僅在保僑</p>
<p>謡傳不足置信</p>
<p>日本海軍陸戰隊在紅口一帶、組織日警隊、時出巡邏、連日視察閘北戰區、致引起中國市民之不安、茲據日方消息、謂日本自九一八以來、軍費支出浩繁、一二八事變、實際作戰、雖僅月餘、糜費竟達日金四百五十萬元、最近東北方面需欵更爲孔亟、國内財政之竭蹶、工商實業之不景氣、均已達於極點、以日本經濟之觀察、日軍實不願在滬再啓任何不幸之事端、以言日本軍力、全國陸軍僅二十萬人、海軍二百餘艦、國内政治情形之複雜、國際對日輿論之嚴重、亦决無悉除原有之國防、以供意外之犧牲、至於本埠日艦、僅駐五艘、俱泊外灘及楊樹浦一帶、陸戰隊總數亦祗二千人、除保護日僑外、無他任務、於滬埠治安、當亦不如謡傳之甚、實不足慮也云云、</p>
<h3 id="c143">外報論抵貨運動 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>越軌行動減少</p>
<p>個人運動擴大</p>
<p>外論社譯八月三十日大美晩報云、上海市市長吳鐵城、鑒於不合法之排日運動與血魂除奸團之活動、有增加中日兩國情感之嚴重、設法取締、現已漸趨緩和、傳吳市長曾與各方領袖開秘密會議、商議抑制血魂團之活動、自前星期北四川路某圖書公司被轟炸以後、迄今未有發生、可見成效顯著、雖然個人抵貨運動、日益擴大、但越軌行動、已大爲减少矣、公開宣傳抵制日貨、現已停止、不但各公共團體自行抑制、即各新聞報章、亦拒絶刊載該項宣傳、但在各銀行紙幣上、大部份印有抵制日貨之口號、如［你不得將此紙幣購買日貨、否則、斷種絶代、［若你將此紙幣購買日貨、男盜女娼］等等、此種風氣、頗有擴大趨勢、</p>
<p>自中國當局表示排日運動、現已趨和緩、日本領事當局今晨亦有同樣之聲明、本報記者今訪日本副領事、謂日人種種不法行爲、亦當積極取締、以免妨碍中日兩國之感情云、</p>

<p>大公社云、本市徐重道國藥號總分號十家、工人二百餘人、於昨晨九時起、全體突然宣吿總罷工、情勢頗爲嚴重、</p>
<p>▲罷工原因　徐重道國藥號、爲上海國藥業中之巨擘、除總店外、尙有支店九處、近因同孚路第七支店、怱於前日失竊參燕、價値洋三四百元、黨由經理樓鶴明報告總經理岑子良、該總經理卽令第一支店經理屈民、向捕房報告、當派探調查、認該店職員鄭沛然有偷竊嫌疑、卽加以拘捕、該店全體職工、聞訊大譁、僉以鄭沛然向來忠實、决無竊盜行爲、今突遭不白之寃、羣認爲經理所誣指、當卽聯合總分店職工、致函總理岑子良、要求在一小時内、向捕房保釋、否則發生風潮、應由資方負責、但岑置未覆、於是昨晨起、總分店全體職工、遂宣告聯合罷工矣、</p>

<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>總說，魚油是化製品的一種，是打從水產動物的脂肪部份採製得來的，牠的用途很廣，像製造肥皂，蠟燭，製革，减摩等，都需用着牠，又因爲牠裏面多維太命，和含有糖分等消化物，所以還可以當療養劑和補身品，目下市上所售的鰵魚（就是鱈魚）肝油，就是一個好例，</p>
<p>魚油的種類很多，若是歸納起來，大槪可以分做三類，（一）海獸油，這是打從鯨類和海豚類的脂肋，頭部，内臟，骨，赤肉，這許多地方採製來的，像海豹，海驢，海象，抺香鯨，槌鯨，一角，眞海豚，滑魚，巨頭鯨等的油質，都是很好的，（二）魚油，　是從鰊，鱈，　，鯥，　等魚類的内臟和肉體裏採製　來的，（三）肝油，這種油是從鱈鮫的肝臟部採製的，至於怎樣去採製，我現在大略的把牠說一下，</p>
<p>製法</p>
<p>採製魚油的方法，大槪分成煑取蒸取煎取三種，</p>
<p>（一）煑取法　先把原料和水投進釜中，煑得沸熱，這所以要牠的油脂融出來，然後可以汲取浮昇在水面的油脂，至於殘滓裏面所含着的油分　可以再用壓榨機來壓出牠，不過榨出來的油，和汲出來的油，種類雖然仍是一樣的，可是品質却分了優劣了，所以一定要分别的放置，以便等待將來的精製，這方法得到的製品，牠的品質要比其他兩種來得好，所以在魚油採製的方法中，這是最通行的，</p>
<p>（二）蒸取法　强靱的原料都適用這個方法，譬如從海獸類的脂肪，肉，骨等採取油脂的時候，多應用　的，方法是用蒸汽的熱力通入那密封原料的鐵罐中，目的也要使牠油脂融出表面而得汲取，這樣可以得到一種質輕色淡的很好的油，不過因爲高熱度的關係，以致常有膠分混合進去，這是牠的美中不足，</p>
<p>（三）煎取法　這是直接的把原料加熱以融出牠的油脂，並不用水來做媒介的一種方法，對於筋肉細胞組織强靱的鯨類，海豚類，可以施以眞火給熱法，對於容易受熱而破壞的一般魚類和鮫，鱈的肝臟等，那麽施以間接給熱法，就是用二重釜通蒸汽熱之，這方法的採製，比較起來是最便利，不過牠所得到的油脂·多少總帶着些顏色，</p>
<p>尾論　用以上三法所得到的油脂裏面，不純物含得頗多，若使馬上要拿來供給需要，那麽牠的價値是很賤，同時貯藏也很困難，以普通都須得經過精製的工程，精製的時候，必須看魚油的種類和性質，不純的原因，應用的方法等，然後决定適宜施用那種方法，若是用物理的方法，那麽有靜置法，濾過法，洗滌法，加熱法等，或是使用化學的方法，像在油脂内加硫酸苛性鈉，炭酸鈣，炭酸鈉等藥品，使牠起化學變化，除去牠的不純物，這種功效倒也很著的，精製以後，若是再使行漂白脫臭兩種手續，那麽製品和品位，更臻於盡善盡美而並稱上乘了，</p>

<h3 id="c219">補充男女平等問題 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 一官</p>
<p>重男輕女是中國五千年來的遺毒，什麽三從四德，女子無才便是德等等好聽名稱把女子硬做就賢妻良母的模型，於是學術，經濟，思想，都腐化而依靠男子，所以現在要一反五千年來習俗，非得女子立定脚跟，認清目標，努力的幹去　並且還需要男子的帮助，</p>
<p>讀了振君和祖娥女士（？）的男女平等問題，及答復振君的男女平等問題，似乎兩性代表，各一方打起筆墨官司，本來這一個問題，由男子方面來討論，當然容易引起女性的誤會，誠如振君舊女子是奴隸，新女子是玩物的話，祖娥女士（？）好像不認這侮辱的話而起來反抗，但是也沒有切實的意見發表，</p>
<p>我記得從前在南洋中學讀書的時候，專研究論理學的王引才先生對我們說，他在某女校敎書，講到男女平等問題，某女生大發牢騷，王引才先生就問她男女平等，難道養兒子也好平分秋色嗎？於是引得哄堂大笑，</p>
<p>這雖然好像說說笑話一樣，但是也有一部份的理由，</p>
<p>現在結婚早，大槪二十歲左右爲父母的都急急爲他們子女完婚，結婚以後，這養兒子的責任，當然放在女子肩上，有了兒子，往往把愛丈夫的心移小兒身上，這是女子的美德，愛兒子甚於生命，但是一方面料理家務，撫養兒女，往來酬酢，……一人之精力有限，那裏還有餘閒注意到政治，社會，經濟等問題，所以要談男女平等，是難之又難，同時也是極容易的事，只要打倒了［奴隸］［玩物］等名稱，在家庭中站在同一水平線上做［人］，男子對外，女子助内，再推廣而至社會，國家，同一的道理，</p>
<p>因爲女子不能直接和政治，社會，經濟……發生關係，可以助理内政，帮助丈夫分工合作·等於直接發生關係，在這方面討論男女平等，似乎雙方都有完滿的解答，只要在同一線上做［人］，就是男女平等了，</p>
<p>鄙人不敏，用敢向振君及祖娥女士（？）以爲如何？但是鄙人沒有啓　開戰的動機，不過替雙方作和事老，補充僅有的意見，請不吝賜敎，</p>

<p>— 昂英</p>
<p>某大學有一個慣例：每季大考之後，總要開除一批考試舞弊（如抄書，倩人代考……）及英漢兩科不及格的學生丨這慣例實行了多年。一般被開除的學生自認沒本領，也不敢怪學校當局的不是。但是不知足的。人人都知道開除的危險，每季却仍然有許多人舞弊，不及格，而至於開除！這也許是奇跡吧？</p>
<p>也是某季的大考後，從註册處傳出來的消息，知道又有許多人被開除，而Ｂ也在開除之列，他心裏很不甘服，躱在宿舍裏大發脾氣，［豈有此理！我應該被開除，而她却除外？］</p>
<p>同房老Ｐ驚訝的望着他：［什麽？你被開…］</p>
<p>［英漢不及格嗎？］</p>
<p>［不！大考舞弊啦！］</p>
<p>［活該！誰呌你鎭天裏同娘兒們胡混！］</p>
<p>［眞是……］老Ｂ埀頭喪氣的詈自已，［媽的，總是那狐媚子的不是，弄得心癢難捨，沒心兒念書，那考西洋史的朝晨，我就偷偷翻開英文原本來抄，那知道監考李老貓會在我後面瞧着冷笑呢？］</p>
<p>［活該！］老Ｐ也復可憐他，</p>
<p>［活該？］老Ｂ忽的跳起來，臉漲得活像熟螃蟹，［我抄書旣然該開除，她爲什麽除外？］</p>
<p>［誰？］</p>
<p>［Ｍ女士！她坐在我隔座兒，她同樣的，而且同時的在翻書偷抄，李老貓也看見的，爲什麽她沒開除？剛才我去問李老貓，他說：Ｍ女士好好兒的爲什麽要開除！一聽，我就氣得發昏，眞豈有此理！］老Ｐ說得嘴角生白沬，</p>
<p>老Ｂ點點頭：［算了吧！現在的天下是烏鴉一般黑的！］</p>
<p>［不！我要去同李老貓算賬！］</p>
<p>［算了吧！老Ｂ！你難道不曉得李老貓的兒子正同Ｍ女士很要好嗎！趕快去别的學校報名投考，算了！］</p>

<p>— 士本</p>
<p>一座高大的洋房裏，跑出一個衣服都麗，唇上蓄着三髭鬚的老人家。由他身上打扮看來，可以知道他是一個社會上所謂上等階級中的紳士老爺，他一到門外，就跳上門口停靠的雪白幌亮的包車，嘴裏也沒吩咐怎魔，兩隻手，又不作任何指示，已由一個像活發動機般的包車夫，拉了飛也似的向前狂奔，原來這個大廈的主人，也即這輛華麗的包車主人，每天到了下午四時，必得到一處地方，去幹一椿逍遥快樂的神秘勾當，天天習以爲常，風雨無阻，包車夫也是拉慣了，所以現在他上了車，不打招呼，車夫也明白他的目的地，而拉了就走。</p>
<p>貼搭貼搭，車夫的鞋底，打在光滑的柏油路上，起了這樣一個很有律調的清晰聲音，一路拉來，到了鄭家木橋相近，忽然面前湧塞了一羣人們，阻止了包車的前進，這時有十餘個學生裝束的青年，手裏持着毛竹筒，和一面寫着［援助東北義軍募捐隊］的白旗，正在馬路上向羣衆募捐，看見了這輛漂亮的包車過來，立時都蜂湧上來，誠誠懇懇地向老紳士勸募，［先生！現在熱河吿急，義勇軍浴血抗日，餉彈俱缺，請你捐助些吧］青年們說時，臉上都現着熱烈着情緖，似乎遇着了這位資產階級的包車主人，一定可以得到他熱忱的同情，而慷慨地解囊的，那知車上的老紳士，聽了若輩的話，面部立時映着不滿的彩色，而答道，［呵！募捐嗎？對不起，我今天身上不便，請别處去捐吧。］說時，脚在車板上一蹬，車夫阿毛，非常識相，便用手排開面前的人羣，一溜烟地拉着車子絶塵而去。</p>
<p>拉出了一箭之路，老紳士的心方纔安定，並對阿毛說道，［可惡，這般小孩子，吃飽了飯，不去讀書，倒來管這種閒事，東洋人打進來，要我出銅鈿，眞眞放屁了，你想，這是國家的事，與我怎麽相干，哼，哼，小孩子，看得錢輕，你們要我的錢，兩鈿換我一鈿，…］車子拉到汕頭路，在一所高掛着一塊和募捐旗大小彷彿的銅牌，上面寫着［ＸＸ書寓］的房子門前，停了下來，他下落車子，身輕似燕的飛也似地跑了進去，一會兒髣髴有　個女人聲口，在說，［大少！我這隻鑽鐲，一千元，明天他們要來收賬了，不付是面子修關的，所以和你商量商量，帮帮忙，綳綳我面子，］女子聲口完了，接着一個說得很急的男子聲口，［有，有，有，區區小事，說怎麽帮忙呢，］</p>
<p>幕色沉沉，華燈初上的時候，鄭家木橋邊頭，又經過一輛漂亮的包車，車中人，到了這里，似乎有什麽深刻的迴想</p>

<p>— 友如</p>
<p>近來科學發達，人生起居日用，疾病飲食，幾乎沒有一樣不拜牠底厚貺，而警政司法機關，賴此以偵查案件的也很不鮮，尤以指紋一科，最爲重要，凡人中指底羅紋，各個不同，恰如他們底面貌一般，而且一經留下指紋，無論在何種物質上，皆能永遠保留，非經揩抺洗滌，决不走樣或消失，所以這種學問，在辦案上，固有絶大效用，尤其是辨明犯人底初犯，或再犯，三犯，憑鑑（印鑑）騐紋，决無舛訛，這是中外各國行之已久而很著成效的了。</p>
<p>最近還有一事，是從受害人底睛光，用攝影術，顯出他臨死時最後所見底人，據說：人底瞳神，能夠將所見人物，保留影象，至第二次再見别底人物時方才留下新的，而消除以前所見，被殺底人，人死而瞳神底最後影象，不得消滅，假定他最後所見底人，即其殺他底凶手，那麽，辦案底人，就可以憑瞳神攝影，而覓取凶手，許多暗殺案子，便可藉此解决了。</p>
<p>但天下事有利必有弊，即法有定而人事旡定，譬如凶手殺人，人將殺而凶手已逸，同時，忽有人聞聲來援被殺之人，此人到而其人剛死，那麽，死者最後底精神，所留之象，不是凶手，而爲救他底人，貽誤案情，豈不更甚？更就指紋說，新近也有人發明，以白蠟套指端，作成假指紋，便能淆亂偵探目光，即使不用此法，而遇精細底犯人，在作案時，御一任何質地底手套，也可以滅去痕迹，且更有利用無知之輩，嫁禍他人的，總而言之，科學雖好，只供人底利用，不能作爲規例，泥而不化，爲害更不可勝言了。</p>

<p>英是我的好友，他平日行止很檢，是個矯矯不羣的大好青年，雖然收入並不富裕，倒也很能自給，可是他年近弱冠，性慾上的煩悶，難免與時俱進，他很想得到一個異性，做他永久的伴侶，</p>
<p>今夏自從他結識了好多的酒肉朋友之後，由他們的介紹，結識了一位女性，芳名ＸＸ，聽說好是ＸＸＸ下堂妾，一個是曠夫，一個是怨女，兩下厮混得火一般熱，起初開開房間，後來自已借了房屋，儷然是一對小夫妻哩，</p>
<p>那時他對於一切，似乎覺得很滿意啊，這萬惡的上海，他是墮落了啊，不到六個月光景，英已花費掉了整千的袁頭，他並不是富家子弟，怎經得起他［揮金如土］般浪用呢？他爲了要博那女郎的歡心，就挪用了好多的行欵，不意好事（？）多磨，事爲碧眼兒偵悉，堅令他退職，這眞是他所夢想不到的一個晴天霹靂啊！</p>
<p>英在突然失業之後，又爲病魔所侵，家人更復白眼相加，他難受極了，就毅然决然的斬斷情絲，聽說英自從和那女子脫離之後，就束身自好，目下已覓得了相當的職業，家人也就另眼相待了，所以我很替他慶幸，這眞是浪漫男子的［當頭棒喝］呢！</p>

<p>失業一項，近年來已演成世界重大問題之一，歐美各國及日本之政治家，皆分集其一部分視線於此項問題，亟謀解决之法，其民間機關如救世軍青年會婦女俱樂部及各種慈善團體，亦莫不視其力之所及，以圖救濟辦法，</p>
<p>吾國自去歲水災與九一八事件，及今歲一二八滬戰以來，失業乃成一極嚴重問題，前者聞政界當局及各慈善團體，亦有大規模之籌劃，惟以中外各國人士眼光觀之，則無不以此項問題極爲複雜，解决不易，故須從長計議，以謀一完善之計劃，</p>
<p>然以吾人觀之，吾國之失業問題，與歐美各國各有其不同之點，其構成失業之原因，且正相反，　歐美因應用機械製造，致產品額過剩，同時銷塲滯鈍，故發生失業之事，至於吾國，則由經濟混亂，實業無保障，且天災人禍，紛至沓來，廠家迭相停閉，其他各種機關，皆實行减政裁員政策，是以演成今日之失業現象，</p>
<p>由此觀之，歐美之失業問題，或暫無解决辦法，吾國則不然，設社會及政府能實力提倡·多辦生產事業，多設製造工廠，開闢利源，則此項難題，即可迎刃而解也，</p>
<p>近聞有中國民生自助社之組織，專事發展社會生產能力，以圖解决各界失業問題，頗能計劃扼要，吾甚望其早日實現，則社會可減除無限担負與痛苦也，</p>

<p>市上所有的［擦銅油］大都是舶來品，雖然國貨也有幾種，但是與舶來品比較起來，眞有天淵之别，舶來品的擦銅油是比較所有的國貨光亮，時間經濟與光亮耐久，所以中國的擦銅油是被舶來品壓逼，是很少數人去用它，</p>
<p>我對於科學是門外漢，這擦銅油一物我每月需用它是很多的，舶來品的價錢很貴，國貨雖然比較便宜些，但是貨與價相比起來，還是用舶來品來得經濟，唉！先生！我爲了這擦銅油費了幾乎一個月去研究它，但是結果總比不上那舶來品來得［光亮耐久］不能耐久是我很大的缺點，一時亦沒有相當的朋友來帮助我，假使先生見我這樣苦心研究而致於失敗來指點我，那是我萬分的感激的，我能夠到先生面前來討敎，在何論什麽時間，我希望你答應我的請求，同時我亦能夠帶我所研究而未成功的東西到你的面前，</p>
<p>我的住址是在本埠北河南路桃源坊第一百四十四號，何論如何給我一個回音吧，你知道我現在正在企盼你的佳音啊！祝進步，李厚德上，八月八日</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Northeast Problem and US-Japan Relations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Hua</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese government has been, on the one hand, sending Mutō as a special envoy to Manchuria to conclude so-called basic treaties with the puppet organization. On the other hand, Foreign Minister Uchida, representing the interests of the military clique, aims to reverse right and wrong in the provisional parliament, making lengthy speeches to justify the recognition of the puppet organization of Manchuria. They blatantly disregard the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations Assembly, ignore the sincere advice given by the League of Nations Investigation Commission during its stay in Japan, treat the Nine-Power Treaty as non-existent, and consider the Kellogg-Briand Pact as waste paper. Their aggressive attitude directly challenges the principles of the world and makes enemies of all kinds of peace guarantees. One may ask, will the League of Nations and the United States turn a deaf ear and not consider countermeasures? Or will they quickly devise effective countermeasures to confront them? This is a major issue concerning the security of East Asia and even the world, which should be given serious attention by us.</p>
<p>News has spread that although the Investigation Commission has not formally expressed its opinion, members of the commission have unofficially stated that the commission's report and its conclusions will not be affected or changed by Japan's recent actions. However, the United States remains silent and has not expressed its position. According to a Washington dispatch: [In any case, before the publication of the League of Nations Investigation Commission's report, the US government will not issue any further declarations regarding the Northeast problem.] Before the US government makes a formal statement, what kind of policy the United States will adopt towards Japan is only a matter of speculation, and no one dares to predict. However, upon careful examination of the past and recent US-Japan relations, it is clear as day whether the relationship between the United States and Japan will deteriorate to the point of rupture. Please allow me to briefly discuss this.</p>
<p>In the past, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany said: [Germany's future lies on the sea.] This aroused the jealousy of the island nation of Britain. Later, Britain eventually joined the Entente powers to fight against Germany, precisely because island nations are most wary of others encroaching on their maritime hegemony to limit the development of their imperialism. The relationship between the United States and Japan is actually the same. During the time of US President Lincoln, Secretary of State Seward once said: [America's future lies in the Pacific.] Later, President Roosevelt also said: [He who controls the Pacific can hold world hegemony.] The United States and Japan have long been engaged in secret rivalry for hegemony in the Pacific, which is not a matter of a single day. In 1905, Roosevelt mediated the Russo-Japanese War. Although Russia was defeated, it was not liable for war reparations. What Japan gained from Russia was only the southern half of Sakhalin Island. At that time, although Russia's diplomacy was very clever, Roosevelt, for the sake of power relations in the Pacific, did not want to favor Japan. This was one reason why Japan sacrificed greatly but gained little. Since then, US-Japan relations have gradually deteriorated from superficial harmony.</p>
<p>When World War I broke out in 1914, the European powers were all caught up in the vortex of war, and they had no time to attend to the balance of power in East Asia. At that time, Japan was arrogant and had the air of being the sole ruler in East Asia. It first declared war on Germany and sent troops to Shandong. Then, it took advantage of Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the monarchy and presented the Twenty-One Demands, forcing us to recognize it. At that time, the United States supplied Europe with food and munitions, and it leaped to become a creditor of Europe. Its economic development progressed rapidly. Although Japan also took advantage of the fire to loot, its industry and commerce flourished greatly, and its national power grew stronger. However, because the United States interfered, its aggression against China was somewhat restrained. Later, when Japan sent troops to Siberia, the United States repeatedly prevented it from advancing to Baikal and hindered its expansion in northern Manchuria. The United States suppressed Japan everywhere, preventing it from doing what it wanted. How could Japan not resent the United States? In addition, the United States' exclusion of colored immigrants and suppression of Japanese residents also repeatedly aroused Japan's deep antipathy towards the United States. What was even worse was that Japan had just suffered a major earthquake disaster in 1923, and the United States implemented anti-Japanese immigration laws the following year. The Japanese government and people were all deeply saddened and angered. Some scholars even said that Japan must fight the United States to maintain its status as a first-class power.</p>
<p>However, after the war, people in various countries, fearful of the horrors of war, greatly promoted the peace movement, which was widely supported by all parties. The Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the London Naval Treaty, all signed jointly by the United States and Japan, were the result of this peace movement and served as a guarantee for world peace. Because the United States had this guarantee, it did not use the Philippine Islands as a naval base in the Pacific. The unfinished military installations on Guam were also no longer pursued. Unexpectedly, Japan, taking advantage of the fact that the United States was neglecting preparations, and during our major drought and flood disasters and the world economic panic, destroyed all peace guarantees and relied on military force as omnipotent to invade our Northeast. Our country, from top to bottom, is united in opposition. However, will the United States willingly be deceived by the Japanese, disregard its traditional policy, and hand over its rights in the Pacific? Therefore, unless the internal revolution of the United States and Japan fundamentally changes their foreign policies, the relationship between the two countries will inevitably deteriorate and lead to rupture. It can be asserted that what is unknowable is when the rupture and conflict will occur. The issue of rupture and conflict will be discussed further.</p>

<p>Zhao Jinxiu's Troops Occupy Lishugou and Advance Towards Suizhong</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the anti-Japanese Volunteer Army attacking Shenyang withdrew from Shenyang City and is now divided into groups guarding Qianjinzai, Nantaizhai, Tawan, Shilihe, Hunhe, Jiubian, and other places. The entire Volunteer Army numbers over 3,000, consisting of assembled troops from various units. Japanese reinforcements are advancing towards Qianjinzai, and the Volunteer Army is putting up a strong resistance and attacking Huanggu Tūn. Traffic on the puppet Fengshan Road, Shenhai Road, and Anfeng Road is all disrupted. Koreans are taking the opportunity to cause disturbances, and many Chinese have been brutally killed. The puppet Guojun (National Army) has issued a notice to residents, prohibiting anyone from going out, otherwise they will be killed. Business is suspended throughout Shenyang City, and the people are panicking. The Manchurian Bank and the Bank of China have both been attacked by plainclothes members of the Volunteer Army. Water, electricity, lights, telephone, and postal services are all disrupted. Seven Japanese aircraft at the airfield were burned, and countless shells were lost from the arsenal. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) At 11:30 last night, about 300 members of the Volunteer Army attacked Huanggu Tūn. Another team attacked the Benxi Lake coal mine, but the outcome is unclear. (30th Hualian News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Peng Zhenguo, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army, because the Japanese army repeatedly advanced towards the Rehe border, led Li Xiangyuan's 4th Route Army, comprising more than 2,000 officers and soldiers, on the 11th, carrying 4 million rounds of ammunition, over 120 boxes of hand grenades, and 10 wireless radios, and stationed them in Lingnan for defense. The vanguard has reached the area of Mutoucheng and Liujiazi, only 20 li away from the enemy's defense line. Li's troops have already made contact with the Japanese army in Dayao Gou, Jinxi. Zhao Jinxiu's troops, numbering more than 700, occupied Lishugou on the 13th, killing seven Japanese and capturing five rifles. They are currently pursuing and advancing towards Suizhong. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side has dispatched two aircraft to reinforce Jinzhou-Suizhong. The Japanese army has also increased two divisions on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line. Japanese aircraft fly back and forth between Beipiao and Chaoyang every day, scouting the movements of the National Salvation Army. A major war is imminent. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Situation of Guerrilla Attack on Shenyang City <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, news from foreigners in Shenyang regarding the Volunteer Army's attack on the city on the night of the 28th stated that the Volunteer Army consisted of about 1,000 people, armed with rifles and broadswords. Shortly after midnight, they began their attack. Their main objective seemed to be the Japanese military aircraft base. The Volunteer Army attacked in three teams, each with several hundred people.

<p>The League of Nations Climate Might Be Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>Uchida Hints at Facing Isolation</p>
<p>Using Troops in Jehol Is Not Yet Timely</p>
<p>Plans to Establish a Naval Base in Lushun</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 30th - During today's questioning at the Diet's Budget Committee general meeting, several important points were revealed. One point implied that if the situation in Geneva is unfavorable to Japan, Japan might withdraw from the League of Nations. This hint of withdrawal from the League of Nations was seen in Foreign Minister Uchida's response in the House of Representatives this afternoon. Uchida stated that Japan's position is correct, so he believes things will be in Japan's favor. However, if not, the government will be prepared to adopt the last resort. Other points revealed during the parliamentarians' questioning of cabinet members are as follows: (1) The Japanese Navy is currently studying the possibility of establishing a naval base in Lushun to protect the coast of the Three Eastern Provinces. (2) Japan does not wish to ask the United States to explain the reason for the stationing of its Atlantic Fleet in the Pacific. (3) The Japanese government believes that the problem of Sino-Japanese relations is even more important than the Manchuria-Mongolia problem. (4) The Minister of the Army stated that although [Manchukuo] can find ways to protect itself, he believes that Japan is currently unable to invoke the right of self-defense in Jehol Province.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 30th - Today at the House of Representatives Budget Committee general meeting, Seiyu Ashida questioned Foreign Minister Uchida about the Manchuria problem and then continued to question diplomatic issues. The content is as follows: Ashida asked what the guiding spirit of the policy toward China is. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the mainland of China is more important than the Manchuria-Mongolia problem. The current Sino-Japanese relations are not good and the Chinese government must be asked to reflect. It is hoped that China, Japan, and Manchukuo will jointly maintain peace and order in the Far East. Currently, great efforts are being made to realize this matter. Semba (Seiyu) asked if there is talk of returning the Kwantung Leased Territory to Manchukuo. What is the truth? Uchida replied that this kind of issue has not been considered. Semba asked, based on the current situation, does the government intend to exercise the right of self-defense toward Jehol? Army Minister Araki replied that Japan cannot immediately exercise the right of self-defense due to international relations, relations with China, and other relations. However, it is not known what kind of measures Manchukuo will take in the future for self-defense. Semba asked, in order to guard the Manchurian coastline, Japan needs to build a naval port in the OO area. What is the opinion of the authorities? Navy Minister Okada replied that the naval authorities also recognize its necessity and are currently preparing for it. Takagi (Minseito) asked if the government intends to send retired soldiers to Manchuria to engage in security. Army Minister Araki replied that it is essential to organize military settlements to defend Manchuria and implement reclamation. The Army authorities intend to study this issue.</p>

<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 30th - Stimulated by the pressure and interference from the League of Nations and the great powers, the call for establishing an Asian Monroe Doctrine is gradually increasing. The Army's top leadership this afternoon invited Privy Council Advisor Kaneko Kentaro to the Army Minister's official residence to lecture on the circumstances when the late U.S. President Roosevelt advised Japan to establish an Asian Monroe Doctrine.</p>

<p>Regarding the Issue of the Minister of Agriculture's Advancement and Retreat</p>
<p>The Center of Parliament Shifts to the House of Peers</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 30th - The compromise between the government and the Seiyukai was not established. The Rice Emergency Facilities Bill proposed by the government will be rejected, which is clear. In that case, the Minister of Agriculture Goto will lose all face, and when the issue of Goto's advancement and retreat arises, Prime Minister Saito will try his best to retain him. Although the government has tried its best to resolve the Seiyukai issue, the Seiyukai's attitude remains strong. The government has already decided on a policy. If the government's proposal is rejected, it intends to oppose the Seiyukai's claims in the House of Peers. Therefore, it has begun a campaign of understanding with the House of Peers.</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 30th - This morning, Minister of Agriculture Goto issued a statement saying that the Seiyukai's proposals for revising the Rice Law and resolving rural debt cannot be implemented. If the Seiyukai insists on its original resolution, even if it passes the Lower House with the power of the majority party, the government will ignore it. The government hopes that the Seiyukai will reflect on this as soon as possible to avoid chaos in the current situation.</p>

<h3 id="e87">The Truth About the Meiji Sugar Tax Evasion Incident <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Fascists Use This to Call on the People</p>
<p>The Military Takes the Opportunity to Overthrow the Cabinet and Establish a Dictatorship</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 30th - Since Representative Tsugumo of the Lower House questioned the Meiji Sugar tax evasion case yesterday, suspicions about Chief Tax Officer Nakajima have intensified. The Ministry of Finance issued a statement on the 18th of this month stating that it was Nakajima's sole decision and was not approved by Finance Minister Takahashi. Nakajima will resign to take responsibility, and Finance Minister Takahashi also stated at the Lower House Budget Committee general meeting yesterday that if someone in the Ministry of Finance resigns to take responsibility because of this, he himself will also retire. Therefore, the Meiji Sugar tax evasion case has become a serious political issue and is deeply related to the future of the Japanese political situation. Originally, the Meiji Sugar tax evasion case was the result of a half-year investigation by Prosecutor Kuroda of the Tokyo Northern District Public Prosecutors Office. It was found that the Meiji Sugar Company had illegally evaded 29,773,317.50 yen in consumption tax from 1928 to 1932, and the fine was 561,365.10 yen. The amount to be recovered was 30,334,682.60 yen. However, Japanese Ministry of Finance officials, bribed by the company, only recovered 730,000 yen and concluded the case. The difference is huge. According to the Public Prosecutors Office, all sugar factories in Japan evade taxes. If all sugar factories in the country are thoroughly investigated, 30,000,000 yen can be recovered. It is planned to start investigating the remaining sugar factories after the Diet session. Since the Meiji Restoration, there have been many examples of Japanese capitalists' illegal behavior. In the past, they have always been leniently punished, but this time the Meiji Sugar Factory is being severely punished alone. There must be a reason for this. The military police and fascists (namely the Nationalist Masses Party and the Jinmu Association) are taking the opportunity to mobilize. The Japanese military and fascist party members are plotting to win over the people's hearts, use this to overthrow the capitalists, call on the people, and seize power. Originally, although the Meiji Sugar Factory is the industry of the Mitsubishi and Yasuda conglomerates, it is not very important to their financial hegemony. The Japanese military and fascists outwardly advocate overthrowing the conglomerates, but in reality, they dare not attack the main camp of financial capitalists, intending to cooperate with them in the future. It is said that Baron Hiranuma strongly supports the Public Prosecutors Office, which can also clarify the inside information.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Increased Tariffs on Imported Indian Goods Deal a Major Blow to the Sales of Japanese Cotton Cloth <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 30th - The Indian government's decision to increase import tariffs on non-British cotton cloth has caused great alarm in Japan. The increase in the new tax is too large, and the speed of its implementation is unexpected. Now that Japanese cotton cloth cannot be sold in China, and the Indian government has taken this action again, it is feared that Japan's export trade will be greatly affected, especially for lower-quality cotton goods.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Ximola, 29th - The import tariff on non-British cotton cloth will be immediately increased from 31 1/4 percent to 50 percent ad valorem. This is the result of the Indian Tariff Board's report. This tax increase will hit Japan the hardest, because Japan supplies the most cotton cloth after the United Kingdom. When the tax increase proposal was first raised, Japanese businessmen in India sent a delegation to meet with Rina, the Commercial Commissioner of the Governor-General's Executive Council, to discuss the matter. The Japanese business delegation denied the allegation of dumping. Rina replied that the Tariff Board would listen to both sides' opinions. After the Tariff Board heard both sides' statements, it made this recommendation to increase the tax. The minimum tax for raw plain cloth is 5 annas 25 per pound, or 50 percent ad valorem, whichever is higher. The current tariff is 4 annas and 8/3 percent per pound. The Tariff Board's report has not yet been published, but the Indian government's resolution on this recommendation has briefly described the outline of this report. The Tariff Board has affirmed the question of whether the price of imported cotton cloth not made in the United Kingdom is too low, which has caused the current protectionist tariffs to lose their effectiveness. It also said that the Indian government's actions are slightly restricted by the 1904 India-Japan Treaty, because the treaty stipulates that in any case, a higher tax should not be levied on Japanese goods alone. The Indian government does not want to implement any plan that discriminates against Japan, so it decided to increase the tax on all non-British piece goods, regardless of nationality. This new tax will remain in effect until the end of March 1933.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 30th - The Manchester Guardian's editorial today, titled [Another Shanghai Trick?], briefly stated that if another outbreak occurs in Shanghai that suits Japan's purpose, Japan can obviously easily create it. The Lytton Commission's report will prompt the League of Nations to determine its position. Therefore, the publication of this report will cause a tense situation in the Three Eastern Provinces, or it may also make Japan feel the need to play a trick in Shanghai to divert attention. Uchida boasted that the establishment of [Manchukuo] can bring peace and stability to the Far East. This may be true, but the current situation is not encouraging.</p>

<p>▲ According to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo, recently the headquarters of the Soviet Russian International Communist Party instructed the Japanese Communist Party branch to investigate the manufacturing capacity of military supplies throughout Japan, the amount ordered from other countries, and the names of the people in charge, etc. They are about to carry out some kind of unstable plan against Japanese military supply manufacturing factories, and at the same time promote an anti-imperialist and anti-war movement from within. After receiving a secret report, the Metropolitan Police Department immediately ordered all military factories to be seriously guarded. Also, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Metropolitan Police Department has repeatedly suppressed the subversive activities of extreme left-wing elements, but the number of left-leaning elements in various places is still increasing daily, especially the extreme elements of the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union and metal workers in military supply factories, as well as the Japanese Radio Telegraph and Telephone Workers, etc., are secretly plotting sabotage activities with great effort. Fortunately, the ringleaders Tojo, Mizoguchi, Ogawa, etc., more than ten people, were arrested in advance, so that accidents were avoided. Also, the arsenal of the Kanazawa Engineering Brigade, filled with wartime supplies, suddenly caught fire a few days ago. Fortunately, it was seen by the sentry of the nearby gunpowder depot, who tried his best to extinguish the fire, and only one corner was burned, so that a major disaster was avoided. Moreover, the Kanazawa Engineering Brigade happened to be going to Inuyama, the county magistrate, for exercises, leaving only a few dozen people behind. An investigation after the incident revealed that the cause of the fire was quite significant.</p>
<p>The German Parliament Convened Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e91">Dissolution May Be Inevitable <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>President Hindenburg Trusts Papen</p>
<p>Fiscal Policies Will Be Implemented by Decree</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 30th - A very serious situation in Germany is brewing again. Germany's fate may soon be in turmoil again. The new parliament convened for the first time today, but because the situation is serious, it may be dissolved immediately. In any case, dissolution seems inevitable within a few days. President Hindenburg and Prime Minister Papen share the same views. They met in Neudeck this morning. Interior Minister Gehr and Defense Minister Schleicher also attended the meeting. A communiqué was issued after the meeting, briefly stating that the President and Prime Minister discussed the national economic program proposed by the Prime Minister. The President instructed Papen to implement policies that can protect Germany's living standards and the social thinking of workers. It is reported that Papen has been given full power by the President to deal with any contingencies.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 30th - This morning's meeting between German President Hindenburg, Prime Minister Papen, and Army Chief of Staff Schleicher in Neutek has produced a complete agreement between the German head of state and the Federal Cabinet. According to this agreement, which was reported from the Neutek office, all attempts by the German Parliament to overthrow the Papen and Schleicher cabinet have been reduced to nothing. The German President fully supports the current government's economic and financial plans. The outline of this plan was elaborated by Prime Minister Papen in a policy speech in Münster last Sunday. This plan will also be promulgated by President Hindenburg in the short term as a [substitute legal order]. Yesterday, the Social Party Union and the Christian Union sent a telegram to Prime Minister Papen, requesting that the socialist interests of the German working class in politics and society should be sought for relief and protection. Therefore, the government had to announce the [substitute legal order] to deal with it. In short, the Papen cabinet has now gained the President's trust and can take expedient measures in everything. The trip to Neutek was not in vain. Although the official report did not mention the dissolution of the parliament at all, it seems that Prime Minister Papen must have carried the President's order to dissolve the parliament back to Berlin and will announce it at a suitable opportunity. In that case, the Federal Parliament, which will hold its first meeting at 3 pm this afternoon, may end its short life. What is not peaceful is that even if a compromise is reached between the National Socialist Party and the Center Party to form a majority cabinet, President Hindenburg will refuse to hand over power to this mixed cabinet. Therefore, the struggle between the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament will disappear before it even begins. This is the reason for this [cabinet victory].</p>

<p>▲ National Press, Berlin, 29th - German Prime Minister Papen and Defense Minister General Schleicher again had a long talk with National Socialist Party leader Hitler today, still trying to give the National Socialist Party the positions of Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Government and Prime Minister of the Prussian Government. Hitler refused to accept it as before and insisted on completely controlling the government, and said that this was his minimum condition. After the meeting, Papen and Schleicher went to Neutek to meet with President Hindenburg. It is likely that they intend to ask the President to sign the order to dissolve the parliament so that if necessary, they can issue this order after convening the parliament tomorrow. Currently, Hitler has reached an agreement with the Catholic Center Party to cooperate in the election of the speaker of the new parliament. The National Socialist Party's most likely candidates are Stur and Förik.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 29th - National Socialist Party leader Hitler gave a speech to 230 members of the party in parliament, mentioning the case of five National Socialist Party members in Bruns判 定 being sentenced to death. He said that those who fight and live for Germany have rights and laws, while those who oppose Germany are not tolerated by the law. He also said that a 波關 traitor actually killed five National Socialist Party members, and he and the party members did not know why. Hitler repeatedly stated his reasons for taking over the government, saying that he was unwilling to accept the conditions proposed by the current rulers, so the rulers did not hand over power to him. But given time, he can obtain his rights. It is possible to govern the country without parliament, but it is absolutely impossible to govern the country without the people. 14 million Germans support his movement. With this support, he should get absolute power.</p>

<p>The Securities Market Saw a Big Improvement</p>
<p>Both the Left and Right Wings Spoke Out in Opposition</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 30th - The stock exchange was excited when it heard Papen's broadcast speech on the economic program, but the unions and the National Socialist Party were alarmed and criticized it. The unions criticized Papen for simply not knowing about social events and said that the minority party, which is opposed by the whole country, wants to infringe on workers' rights, which is hateful. The unions refused the government's plan to arrange unemployment. The National Socialist Party also opposed this economic program, saying that eliminating workers' rights is extremely dangerous. This move cannot increase purchasing power, but reduce it. At the same time, the stock market, except for bank stocks, improved, rising to five pounds. The market received many buy orders for securities from home and abroad, which shows that the general public trusts the Papen government.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 29th - Lancashire's largest industrial struggle in history has now begun ardently. Today, when touring the cotton mill area, what catches the eye is that the chimneys stand tall, none with smoke. Unemployed weavers gathered on the road to discuss the dispute. According to the report of the secretary of the Weavers' Union, 65,000 workers went on strike this morning, and it is feared that the number will increase to 140,000 by evening. All factories in the northeast of Lancashire are expected to be closed by Wednesday. Then there will be a total of 170,000 people on strike. However, the Qian Ganbaismi Shike'ertote weaving factory in the Life area is still paying the old wages temporarily and is operating as usual. Strikers have so far maintained order. Except for a group of strikers in Ecklington, mostly girls, who demonstrated against the workers who resumed work, there were few incidents reported elsewhere.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Rotterdam, 30th - The dispute brewing between Dutch ship owners and sailors has erupted today. The Seamen's Union and the Transport Workers' Union decided to declare a strike. The ship owners recently implemented a new wage system, which caused great anger among the sailors. Many people quit their jobs to express their opposition. The ship owners hired outsiders to replace them. Now, because the ship owners refuse to fire the newly hired sailors and rehire the old sailors on better terms, it was decided to implement a general strike starting today.</p>

<p>▲ National Press, Boston, USA, 30th - The last total solar eclipse in the United States before 1970 will be visible tomorrow in the eastern part of the United States and Canada. If the weather is clear tomorrow, 2 million people will be able to look up and see it. According to astronomers' predictions, the total eclipse will occur at 3:30 PM. It is said that the path of the total eclipse will start at the North Pole, gradually move towards Hudson Bay, then pass through Montreal, Canada, and enter the United States. Therefore, from McGill University in Montreal to the Atlantic coast of the United States, many scientists will take photos of the solar eclipse for comparative research and to solve various mysterious problems. Furthermore, the Earth's weather seems to be based on the black spots on the sun, and the black spots reach their extreme once every eleven years. However, why the black spots affect each year differently has never been discovered. Therefore, those who study solar eclipses take this problem as the goal of exploration, and the solar corona cannot be seen until a total solar eclipse.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Open on September 15</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence, the Ministry of Transportation of the puppet state of Manchuria has now invested 5 million yuan to establish an airline company, named the Manchukuo Air Transport Company. It is nominally a joint venture between officials and civilians, but in fact it is still controlled by the Japanese. The head office is located in Changchun. Six air stations are set up in Manzhouli, Andong, Shenyang, Dalian, Shanhaiguan, and Changchun. The company has now ordered 14 passenger planes from the Japanese Mitsubishi Aircraft Factory and Kawasaki Shipyard, all of which have been shipped to Shenyang. After the equipment is complete, it is scheduled to open on September 15. (August 26)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Investigations by the Hubei High Court into the Sichuan River Dragon Case <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>He Chengjuan Requests Headquarters to Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: After Liu Wenjin, the main suspect in the Sichuan River Dragon case, was arrested and brought to the Wuchang District Court Prosecutor's Office, the chief prosecutor of that court, Hu Shu, released Liu on bail. Recently, Zhang Nanxian, the director of the Supervisory Department of the Party and Government Committee, reported this to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Chiang ordered the Party and Government Committee and the Provincial Government to arrest Hu and place him under temporary custody. This case once again drew public attention. Chiang and Chen telegraphed the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, urging them to handle the case strictly. They also emphasized that public litigation should not be delayed and ordered the High Court to temporarily send personnel to act as agents. After receiving the order, the court dispatched prosecutor Li Shien on August 29th to temporarily take over the case. At the same time, the Wuchang District Court also detained Chen Dinghua, Liu Wenjin's guarantor, and ordered him to hand over Liu. Chen's relatives then turned in Liu Wenjin, and he was returned to the District Court for detention. The Sichuan River Dragon case was then transferred to the High Court for investigation and handling. The Pacification Commissioner, He Chengjuan, considering that the case occurred while he was in charge of the provincial government, submitted a detailed report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, outlining the circumstances of the case. He also earnestly requested that the military law office thoroughly investigate the matter to clarify the truth. The report stated: [I respectfully request a thorough investigation of the circumstances of the Sichuan River Dragon Company's embezzlement of dyke funds during my tenure as the Governor. Your Excellency instructed me to be diligent. I am ashamed and grateful and eagerly hope that the Sichuan River Dragon Company case can be resolved according to law as soon as possible so that officials will know what to avoid and rumors will be dispelled. Unexpectedly, Hu Shu, the chief prosecutor of the Wuchang District Court, allowed the main suspect, Liu Wenjin, to abscond on bail, making it difficult to conclude the case. If he is allowed to delay further, public opinion will be stirred up, making social observation even more complicated, creating numerous complications, and making it impossible to recover the dyke funds. It has been verified that the accused, Liu, formerly served as the accountant of the Dyke Construction Funding Management Committee and colluded with the Sichuan River Dragon Company to embezzle more than 800,000 yuan of dyke funds. At that time, I, as the Provincial Governor, arrested him and recovered the funds in installments, but more than 150,000 yuan was still outstanding. As I was about to leave office, I sent the accused to the Hubei High Court, which forwarded him to the Wuchang District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling. The office procrastinated for several months without prosecuting him. Since I was no longer in charge of provincial affairs, I could not urge them. Now that I have left office, there must be doubts. First, Liu Wenjin has been in the custody of the office for four months. It is not too long for an investigation. Why has he not been prosecuted or given a reason for not prosecuting? Second, this case involves dyke funds and has caused a national sensation. It is very different from other cases. Why was the Provincial Government not consulted? He was only ordered to pay a 1,000-yuan guarantee before being released on bail. Considering the law, Hu Shu may have other intentions. Your Excellency can see everything clearly. Please order that the official be arrested and handed over to the military law office for detention and interrogation. Once the clues are found, the root cause will be easy to understand. I beg you to instruct the office to thoroughly investigate and punish according to law. In addition to requesting to review the entire file of the Provincial Dyke Construction Funding Management Committee and the Prosecutor's Office, I also ask that all former provincial government officials involved be summoned for questioning to uncover the truth." However, according to information from the legal community, the statutory investigation procedure has a time limit of two months and, due to special circumstances, can be extended for two months, for a total of four months. Liu Wenjin was taken into custody by the Wuchang Court Prosecutor's Office on April 1 of this year. It immediately sent a letter to the Provincial Government requesting it to collect evidence related to the entire Sichuan River Dragon Company case. Until the end of August of the same year, the Provincial Government had not yet responded. At that time, Hu Shu had verified that the statutory investigation period had expired. Since he could not file a public prosecution within the time limit, he should have temporarily released him on bail in accordance with the law. Therefore, on August 1 of the same year, when the four-month time limit had expired, Hu Shu instructed Liu Wenjin in court to find two reputable shopkeepers as guarantors and deposit a guarantee of 1,000 yuan before being temporarily released. The rumor that Hu Shu accepted bribes to release him originated from this. Furthermore, according to political circles, Hu ignored the seriousness of the case by not notifying the Provincial Government, the direct reporting agency, and publicly granted bail, which was undoubtedly a mistake. However, Hu Shu himself may have believed that the judicial organs should have an independent spirit, free from interference from anyone or any agency or organization, and could handle the case in accordance with legal procedures.] (August 29)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Han Fuqu Strictly Prohibits Unorthodox Propaganda <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu has decided to implement a policy of pacifying the territory and protecting the people during this time of national crisis. He is strictly cracking down on bad elements that endanger local actions and unorthodox propaganda to avoid causing trouble and disrupting public order. Yesterday (the 27th), he specially instructed the Municipal Government, the Garrison Command, the Public Security Bureau, the commanders of the various militia groups, and the county magistrates to stop all activities of groups that have not been approved by the Provincial Party Headquarters or the Provincial Government. At the same time, he issued a public notice to inform the public. The instructions and public notice are recorded below: (1) Instructions: [It has been found that during this time of national crisis, when the local situation is chaotic, all unorthodox propaganda by bad elements is strictly prohibited. Recently, it has been discovered that some people in this city are using the name of groups to carry out propaganda work. It is inevitable that some unscrupulous people are mixed in to pursue other goals. If this is not strictly prohibited, it will inevitably cause trouble in the future. In addition to issuing a public notice and separately ordering the Garrison Command, the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Government to comply, the original public notice is hereby sent. You are ordered to comply with this immediately. Any foreign groups that carry out propaganda in the area without the approval of the Provincial Party Headquarters or the Provincial Government should be stopped by force to prevent chaos from arising. This is the order.] (2) Public Notice: [It has been found that at this time of local chaos, pacifying the territory and protecting the people are the only important tasks of the government. All unorthodox propaganda by bad elements is strictly prohibited. I, the chairman, am in charge of all provincial affairs and have always considered protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people to be my responsibility. Whenever there are actions that endanger the local area or go beyond the bounds, I will do my best to prevent them to prevent chaos from arising. At this time of national crisis, saving the country and seeking survival are the shared desires of all people. However, while patriotism requires enthusiasm, handling affairs requires a broad perspective. If useless propaganda is carried out, it will only cause disturbances and affect public order, which is not a good plan. This situation was repeatedly explained in detail in the public notice at the beginning of the Northeast Incident. I hope that you can understand my sincere efforts. However, it has recently been discovered that some people in this city are using the name of groups to carry out various types of propaganda. It is inevitable that some unscrupulous people are mixed in to pursue other goals. If this is not strictly prohibited, it will inevitably harm the local area. Therefore, I hereby issue a special warning. In the future, any propaganda groups that carry out propaganda in the area without the approval of the Provincial Party Headquarters or the Provincial Government should be stopped by force to eliminate hidden dangers. In addition to ordering the Municipal Government and the various military and police agencies to comply, this public notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. This is the notice.]</p>
<h3 id="e103">Recent News of Bandits in Anhui Province <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Lujiang and Wuwei Suffered Bandit Looting</p>
<p>Losses Exceed Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: In recent years, banditry has been rampant in various counties of Anhui Province. Although the large armies have been dispatched to suppress them, they have not been completely eradicated. The latest news about bandits is summarized below:</p>
<p>▲Lujiang: The county is a rice-producing area. As farmers are now harvesting, a large group of bandits suddenly attempted to attack the county seat. The entire county was in a state of panic. The Wuhu-Lujiang Association recently received an urgent telegram from the county's joint defense office, stating that bandits were pressing the border, divided into three routes, totaling about 1,500 people, in a state of extreme crisis. It requested nearby troops to rush to their aid. The association then convened an emergency meeting and decided to telegraph the provincial government to quickly send troops to suppress them. In addition, Kongcheng Town, which belongs to Tongcheng County and is adjacent to Lujiang, has flourishing commerce. Recently, about five to six hundred fierce bandits, led by a bandit leader nicknamed Zhang Dayong, arrived suddenly. After entering the town, they immediately opened fire to show their power, committing rape, looting, and doing whatever they wanted. All the shops in the town were looted, with losses exceeding hundreds of thousands of yuan. When the bandits left, they also set fire to many shops, which was an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>▲Wuwei: Xia Hechang, a well-known bandit from Wuwei, was arrested in Wuhu a few weeks ago and sent to Wuwei for legal proceedings. Unexpectedly, Xia's gang was extremely large and gathered in Huangluohe Town in Wuwei County, intending to rob him. Fortunately, the police escorting the bandit learned of this and took a detour. After arriving at their destination, they executed Xia by firing squad. Xia's gang was extremely angry and looted Huangluohe Town, causing great losses. They also kidnapped dozens of hostages. The town's chamber of commerce has telegraphed chambers of commerce throughout the province and other organizations, requesting them to report to the provincial government for suppression and relief. ▲Shucheng: Shucheng is currently the base of the Anhui Western Bandit Suppression Army. The 4th Division of Xu Tingyao's troops is concentrated there and is advancing towards the Wulong Temple and Hongjiaji areas. More than a hundred officers and soldiers from various divisions who were previously captured by the Red Army recently took advantage of the bandits' defeat on various fronts and escaped in groups. The 1st Division had five men, the 4th Division had forty-eight men, the 7th Division had five men, the 12th Division had ten men, the 45th Division had ten men, the 46th Division had twelve men, and the Independent 40th Brigade had six men. They all went to the headquarters of the 25th Route Army to request relief. Liang Guanying sent personnel to Hefei to the Anhui Western Seven County Post-Disaster Commissioner's Office for reception. In addition, a large number of Red Army forces have recently been discovered in Susong County, which borders Huangmei in Hubei Province. County Magistrate Sun Keqian received the report and immediately led troops out of the city to defend it and urgently telegraphed the provincial government, which dispatched a battalion of the garrison brigade to provide support.</p>
<p>▲Wuhu: Since the Central Military Academy Training Corps came to Wuhu to garrison, they have been patrolling in shifts day and night, and the local area has been able to enjoy peace. Passenger and commercial ships on the river routes had previously been repeatedly intercepted by bandits. Since the team sent soldiers to escort the ships and carried out inspections at the various wharves, no accidents have occurred. Unexpectedly, the home of Cui Lianggong, a standing committee member of the county chamber of commerce, was recently robbed by bandits. They are currently being pursued. Last night, four bandits armed with three pistols suddenly came to the Henan Wang Sentai rice mill and looted silver dollars, copper coins, gold jewelry, and other items before escaping through the main gate. After receiving the report, the military, police, and commercial groups immediately dispatched teams. The Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau captured four bandits, Ge Jinshan, Wang Shaoren, Liu Biaoli, and Qi Zhengfu, in Mafang, a village on the south bank, and seized the stolen goods, pistols, and other military supplies. They then captured seven more people, including Yang Shaoqing and Ding Huaiqing, and transferred them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. (August 27)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Fuzhou Residents Oppose the House Tax <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government's Repeated Explanations Are Still Ineffective</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The provincial government's recent collection of temporary house and shop tax has caused a strike. Afterward, to ease public opposition, it abolished the temporary house and shop tax office affiliated with the provincial government and transferred it to the Finance Department. The Finance Department believed that the shop tax had already been collected at one month's rent per year and should not be collected again. It then abolished the temporary shop tax and established a house tax bureau, appointing Fang Xifan as the director, and scheduled to start collecting the tax on September 1. However, the fire brigades of various shops and the Commercial Research Institute still maintained their opposition and insisted on the promise made by the provincial government when it collected the first temporary house and shop tax last year that it would be limited to one time and would never be collected again. Now, only a year later, it is being collected again, which is a breach of trust. On the 22nd of this month, they elected dozens of representatives to go to the provincial government to request its cancellation. Acting Chairman Fang Shengtao received them and gave a lengthy speech, stating that the reason why China's rural areas are bankrupt and its cities are abnormally prosperous today is due to the uneven burden on the people. Farmers work hard all year round, and if they encounter a bad year and suffer a complete crop failure, they still have to pay the poll tax and other taxes, which are increasing year by year. Now, it is more than double the regular tax, which can be said to be exhausting. However, the rent for urban houses is soaring year by year. Landlords sit back and enjoy the benefits without lifting a finger and do not bear any tax burden to the country. There is nothing more unfair in the world than this. As a result, wealthy farmers buy houses instead of land. Land is neglected and its value falls, while there is more competition to buy houses, and its value increases, turning into today's abnormal phenomenon. Therefore, the provincial government's collection of house tax this time is in line with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of controlling capital and equalizing land ownership. Acting Finance Director Shi Jialin also hosted the press on the 23rd to explain the house tax, stating that it has been in place for a long time in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hubei provinces and is not an innovation of Fujian Province. Moreover, houses and shops are both real estate. Since shops are taxed, houses should also be taxed. He hoped that the press would assist. However, the joint meeting of the fire brigades of various shops and the Commercial Research Institute yesterday issued the first declaration of Fuzhou citizens opposing the re-collection of house tax, vowing not to pay the house tax at all costs and notifying the public that they should refuse to pay if tax collectors come to collect it. Therefore, this unrest has not been completely resolved. (August 23)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Devastating Flood in Shanxi Province <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand Refugees in the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>More Than Twenty Counties Affected by the Disaster</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The Fen River in Shanxi Province breached its banks, flooding the provincial capital, causing a major disaster. The refugees in the city cannot be properly cared for. Meanwhile, reports of disasters from various counties are pouring in. According to reports received in recent days, more than twenty counties in the province have been affected by the disaster. However, the major disaster areas are cut off from transportation, making it impossible to conduct on-site investigations.</p>
<p>The provincial capital is located at the confluence of the Fen River and the Sha River, so the disaster is the most serious. Fortunately, the authorities dispatched a large number of soldiers, and their efforts to block the breach were effective, preventing the entire city from becoming a water world. In recent days, the authorities have been actively carrying out river works and removing floodwater from the city, which is expected to be completed soon. They are blocking the breach and strengthening the river dikes for the Fen River and the Sha River, and they are digging many ditches to drain the floodwater from the city. The official estimate of the cost of the river works is about seventy to eighty thousand yuan. Since the refugees cannot be properly cared for, there is widespread suffering in the western part of the province, with more than ten thousand people affected. Although the authorities have established agencies such as flood relief committees and refugee shelters, they are insufficient to meet the needs. In addition to having already telegraphed the central government to request relief, the provincial government yesterday also telegraphed various parties to appeal for assistance. Various public organizations have also established flood relief committees and plan to provide large-scale relief. The Taiyuan branch of the International Red Cross is also working hard to raise funds. Refugees are gathering at the Yangqu County government every day to petition for relief, which is a very pitiful sight.</p>
<p>Disaster reports from various counties are pouring in like snowflakes. Among them, the most severely affected, with the greatest losses, the most deaths and injuries, is Beixinwu Village in Jiexiu. According to people from the village, the village is located opposite Nanxinwu Village, which is traversed by the highway. The village has about seven to eight hundred households. During the flood, mountain torrents erupted, and the entire village was submerged. The county government sent police officers to assist residents of neighboring villages in rescuing people at risk, using many interconnected rafts. Only seventy to eighty people and four livestock were rescued from the flood. The remaining seven to eight hundred households have mostly been drowned. The seventy to eighty people who were able to escape were from a wealthy family that had a tall building, allowing family members and neighbors to take temporary shelter and escape danger. The area is still a vast expanse of water, and the total loss of the village is still impossible to estimate. (August 20)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Jiangsu Sericulture Design Council Requests Central Government Funding to Improve Silk <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Sericulture Design Council's current conference resolved many important issues. It will implement the entire plan step by step, such as controlling silkworm eggs and cocoon markets, establishing model silk factories, establishing guidance centers, and expanding mulberry gardens and nurseries. However, all progress requires funding. The conference resolved to request the central government to allocate half of the artificial silk import tax revenue annually to be divided equally with Zhejiang for the purpose of improving silk. The original text is recorded below: [To Song, Minister of Finance, and Chen, Minister of Industry, Nanjing: This year's sericulture failure has been alleviated by your assistance. The people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are deeply grateful. The current Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Design Council believes that a comprehensive plan is needed to save the situation. It has been decided to implement the silkworm egg control policy, establish guidance centers in sericulture areas, expand mulberry gardens and nurseries, and establish model silk factories to cultivate the foundation. However, without funding, it is all empty talk. It is proposed that you check the Shanghai relief meeting's method of rescuing stale silk and cocoons and allocate half of the artificial silk import tax revenue annually for the improvement of silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. This will not harm the national treasury but will benefit the people's livelihood. We hereby telegraph you to sincerely request your approval and implementation. The members of the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Design Council are anxiously awaiting your order.

<p>Three Hundred and Sixty Feet Down the Well</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th at 8 o'clock, the four members of the mining group, Hu Boyuan, Huang Boda, and others, felt that the coal mine inspection from yesterday was not satisfactory. They rode donkeys to the Chenjia River coal mine to conduct an on-site study of everything. The mine is located 35 li east of Tongguan County, and the road along the way is full of narrow paths and high mountains, making it difficult to travel. They arrived at their destination at 12:30 p.m. After briefly asking the miners a few questions, Hu and Huang borrowed cotton clothes from the miners to prepare for resisting the cold deep in the stratum when they entered the well. Before entering the well, the miners first tied thick, long ropes tightly around the thighs and waists of Hu and Huang. After the preparations were completed, Hu and Huang entered the coal well at about 1 p.m. in search of the coal face, falling to a depth of 360 feet. The height from the bottom of the well to the ground was four or five times higher than the Xianshi and Yong'an Companies in Shanghai. When falling, their thighs felt very painful. They swayed down the well, and their heads, hands, and feet sometimes hit the rocks next to the well. If they were not careful, there was a risk of bleeding. At the same time, water from the ground seeped into the well and dripped down, soaking their clothes. Coal gas rose from the bottom of the well, almost suffocating them. This type of inspection was very risky and completely different from the usual inspection of enjoying great feasts everywhere. After a few minutes, the two men reached the bottom one after another. Although there was water at the bottom, it was not much. For one and a half hours, they walked about three li underground but did not reach the farthest point of the mine tunnel. Temporary bunks were set up at the site where underground workers were mining, and stoves were nearby for cooking and blacksmithing. Ordinary coal wells require safety lamps to avoid coal gas explosions, but the workers there still used fire sources that were not isolated from coal gas and had never caused an accident, which was either due to little coal gas or simply luck. At 2:30 p.m., Hu and Huang were afraid that they would not be able to return in time, so they ordered the miners to pull them out of the ground and bought several pieces of coal for the purpose of bringing them back to test their composition.</p>
<p>The coalfield of Tongguan County starts from Tongshugou in the southwest, follows the Tielongtou Mountain to the northeast, passes through Chenjialu Town, and reaches Chenjiahe, with a length of about 120 li. The width near Tongguan County is about 12 li at the widest point. The Chenjiahe coal mine is said to have been opened 80 years ago or 100 years ago, but there is no way to verify this. The first statement is more reliable. The mine has two vertical wells, each 20 feet apart, 360 feet deep (as mentioned above), and 6 feet in diameter. When the depth reaches 260 feet, the first coal seam is encountered, but its thickness is only about three to four feet, so it has not been mined. The current excavation is at 360 feet, which is the second coal seam, with a thickness of about five to ten feet, with red sand and stone interlayers about eight inches thick. The slope of the entire coal seam is only three or four degrees, which is practically parallel to the horizontal line. The most excellent point is that the roof is sandstone and the bottom roof is hard stone, both of which are extremely strong. No supports are needed, and there has never been any collapse in decades. This saves a lot of expenses. The coal quality has more lumps and less fines, which is semi-anthracite. Such an excellent coal mine could make a great fortune if it were in the Yangtze River basin. As for the geological aspect, after expert examination, the uppermost layer is brown-purple shale, followed by mica red sandstone, pigeon-blue shale, interbedded thin coal seams (i.e., waist coal), black shale, quartz sandstone, coal (interbedded rock layer), gray-yellow shale, interbedded coal seams, dense black shale, black clay, black slag, and coal. The coal mine at Chenjiahe has a reserve of about 5,000 tons, while the total coal volume in Tongguan County, including Huiduipo and Yaiyao, is estimated at about 100 million tons.</p>
<p>Ventilation is still done using the ventilation method of burning coal at the bottom of the well to cause the hot air above the well to rise and allow cold air to flow in from other wells. The miners work in shifts of 20 days, earning 15 yuan. Coal is also mined using the horizontal column method, with columns 12 feet square. The coal lane is about three to four feet wide and high, depending on the condition of the coal seam. There are 30 people working in the well, including eight coal miners, fifteen coal pullers, four or five stonemasons, and one foreman. Although the coal pullers are children, they still earn 15 yuan per month. There are 11 people working above ground, including eight winding coal, two sending coal, and one tending the stove, each earning about 50 cents per day. About 90 baskets of coal can be produced each day, and about 28,000 baskets of coal can be produced throughout the year. In addition, the mine has to pay 70 yuan in commercial tax, 40 yuan in coal tax, and 6 yuan in special tax each month, for a total of 116 yuan. According to the results of general chemical analysis, the analysis of Tongguan coal quality is approximately as shown in the following table.</p>

<p>Since our departure, today (the 20th) has been the most disconnected. Although the mining group still has work to do, the other groups have completed their inspections and have nothing to do. We wanted to see the scenery, but we've seen it all. We wanted to stroll in the town, but the entire county only has one street, and we've already seen it all at a glance. It's extremely boring. We want to nap, but we can't fall asleep. We want to read, but our minds are troubled and we can't focus. Furthermore, there are those who are in the Northwest but cannot forget the Southeast, saying, "If the enemy invades Shanghai or Tianjin again, the country will be as precarious as a pile of eggs. What's the use of us staying here to inspect? We will travel quickly east to work hard for the country." Everyone has their own surge of emotion, and worry and distress come together. How can travelers in this environment endure?</p>
<p>In the evening, everyone sat around telling stories to relieve sorrow. Mr. Zhu Qiqing searched the airwaves with the radio for news but found nothing. In this desolate and remote place, not only is there no news from the members of the north and south groups, but we also cannot find out what is happening in the country. Although the members are extremely anxious, there is nothing they can do.</p>

<p>▲ Theft at a Sausage Workshop in Xinzhuang  At a sausage workshop in Dong Wu Jia Wan in Xinzhuang Town, around one o'clock the night before last (the 26th), more than ten robbers suddenly arrived speaking a local dialect. Some of them were carrying handguns and wooden clubs. They broke into the house and searched and robbed at will. It is estimated that they stole ninety-six yuan in cash, jewelry, silk clothing, etc., with a total value of more than two hundred yuan, and then swaggered away. According to the owner, two of the robbers were acquaintances, one being a Mr. Shen who has a history of bad behavior, and the other being a Mr. Jia, formerly a barber in Sijing. Their faces were clearly recognized, and a report will be made to the relevant sub-station requesting investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>▲ Disaster Victims Go to the County Government to Petition  Since the local farmers suffered the ravages of the Japanese army, and recently due to a prolonged drought, the land appears barren. The farmers' lives have become even more difficult. Although the charitable organizations have provided relief once, it is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. On August 27th at 6:00 PM, over a hundred farmers from a part of Xintang Market, led by their respective township chiefs, went to the county government to request relief. They gathered at the front gate of the county government, and the township chiefs went inside to report their intentions. The head of the First Section, Qian Yaonian, received them, inquired about the situation in detail, and pointed out that such actions are extremely illegal. Why did the township chiefs not prohibit this beforehand? When the disaster victims heard this, they immediately became noisy and assertive. Section Chief Qian, fearing an accident, immediately ordered five disaster victims, including Pu Chunquan, to be taken to the back courtyard for reprimanding, while sending a police squad to maintain order. Seeing that they were not getting anywhere, the disaster victims dispersed.</p>

<p>▲ Difficulty Raising Funds for Police Salaries  The county government, owing more than 100,000 yuan in back pay for the river and land police and various administrative expenses, sent a letter to the county Chamber of Commerce, which convened a meeting of representatives from the silver and money industries on the afternoon of the 29th to borrow 100,000 yuan, using land value tax as collateral. The representatives stated that the 30,000 yuan borrowed on behalf of Changshu County this spring has not yet been repaid and must be repaid before further discussions can be held. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the county government reporting the meeting's outcome. County Magistrate Zou, noting that it is a lean time of year, with sluggish tax revenues, and that various expenses urgently need to be paid, still requested the county Chamber of Commerce to find a way to borrow the funds to meet the urgent needs.</p>
<p>▲ Anti-Treason Group Warns Treacherous Merchants  Recently in Suzhou, the organization of various patriotic groups has sprung up like mushrooms, flourishing for a time. The Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly received letters from various groups warning them. The day before yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Youth Anti-Treason and Defend the Country Group, requesting that treacherous merchants be persuaded to stop selling enemy goods and that merchants be encouraged to promote domestic goods. Another letter was received from the Patriotic Anti-Treason Group, stating that in April, a large quantity of enemy goods, fish oil, was imported and purchased by the Xiang Mao Foreign Firm to manufacture Xiang Mao and Bei Ji brand soaps, which were transported and sold in the Yangtze River basin, with the China Soap Company reselling them in various ports. The group requested that all managers and sellers be immediately notified to refuse to sell them, or else they should not blame the bombs for being merciless.</p>

<p>▲ Guidance Center's Method for Selling Silkworm Cocoons  Ding Songlin, director of the Wuxi County Agricultural Improvement Field, in order to improve silkworm breeds, specially established forty guidance centers throughout the county to guide the raising of autumn silkworms. Now, autumn cocoons are about to be on the market, and a unified standard for cocoon prices should be negotiated and agreed upon. Therefore, yesterday morning, he invited Hua Yinchun, an inspector from the Department of Industry, Gu Shuzhi, the president of the Farmers Bank, the managers of the Dingchang, Yongtai, and Qianshen silk factories, and the directors of various centers to a meeting to discuss the matter. The results of the discussion were as follows: (1) Dingchang, Qianshen, and Yongtai factories will jointly invest in organizing the Ding Sheng Tai Cocoon Office. (2) The cocoons produced by the silkworm farmers of each center under this field will be sold uniformly to the Ding Sheng Tai Cocoon Office. A general affairs office for cocoon management will be set up at the Silk Factory Trade Association. (3) Silkworm farmers selling cocoons must present the cocoon sales certificate issued by this field. (4) Cocoon quality will be divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The Cocoon Office will present sample cocoons separately as the standard for evaluating cocoons. A cocoon grading board will be used to evaluate cocoons. (5) The cocoon price standard will be based on other cocoon houses: Grade A will be 10 yuan higher, Grade B will be 5 yuan higher, Grade C will be priced based on high-quality goods, and Grade D will be 2 yuan lower. (6) A separate method for the guidance centers to sell cocoons by district will be determined.</p>
<p>▲ Various Industries Resolve Opinions on Business Tax  Thirty-odd important industries in Xiyi, such as hardware, southern goods, and silk fabrics, gathered at the county Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to discuss the business tax issue. They all agreed that this year, after the floods and the Shanghai war, business has plummeted. In addition, the failure of silk cocoons and the stagnation of finance have affected all industries even more than in other counties. However, the business tax rate set by Jiangsu Province has increased by more than one time compared to last year, which is already difficult for merchants to bear. If this year's business is reported according to last year's actual performance, the tax rate will be doubled and the business will be artificially inflated, which is like draining the pond to catch all the fish, and it is not reasonable. According to investigations by various industries, the Zhejiang Province method is that although the tax rate has been increased, the declaration is still based on the original number from last year and has not been increased. In addition, wholesale sales are reduced by half, and those with dental licenses are further discounted by half on wholesale sales. Rice, flour, and grain are generally exempted from tax. Moreover, Wuxing and other counties still have industry associations collect and handle taxes on behalf of the government, to show the spirit of cooperation between officials and merchants. It was resolved to submit the Zhejiang Province method at this Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Member Congress and to request the provincial government and the executive Yuan's finance and industry ministries to instruct Jiangsu Province to follow the Zhejiang model for the business tax rate and to handle the other matters accordingly in order to stabilize commerce and benefit tax revenue.</p>

<p>▲ Series of Robberies Occur in the Northeast Township  In Dahua Town, in the eastern township, around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, more than twenty robbers suddenly arrived, each carrying handguns and sharp weapons. They first went to the town's Security Corps headquarters to confiscate three long and short guns, and then robbed the Xin Chang Long store of many items, carrying the loot north and escaping. In addition, at the home of Jiang Boshan, a farmer in Jiang Village, Hua Dian Bridge, outside the Ma Lane gate, around 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, more than twenty bandits suddenly arrived, carrying many handguns, broke into the house, and looted everything. His daughter-in-law, hearing the alarm, called for help and was severely burned by the bandits. Subsequently, several more families were robbed in a row, and then they fired guns to intimidate and shouted as they headed southwest.</p>
<p>▲ Robbery Case on Zhongshan Road Solved  After hearing about the robbery case outside Zhongzheng Gate, County Magistrate Wang was furious and ordered the Public Security Bureau to solve the case within a time limit. Inspector Chi of the Fourth Public Security Sub-station, recognizing his duty, led patrol officers to patrol the streets at night. Yesterday, they saw a person wandering at an intersection, acting suspiciously, and approached to question him. The suspect confessed that the Zhongshan Road robbery case was committed by the Hang Shunlong brothers, a rickshaw puller, and himself, and admitted to dividing the stolen money. After receiving the confession, Inspector Chi immediately ordered patrol officers to arrest Hang Shunlong and also apprehended a suspect named Jiang Xiji. They have now been sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲ Outrageous Tutor Sodomizes Students  Chang Le Township, District 3, Jie Xiang Village, Zha Shu Gang, in this county, is located in a remote area without a school. Villagers such as Wu set up a tutoring school at the Wu ancestral hall in the village to educate their children, hiring Bao Yaoru from this county as the tutor. Bao is already in his sixties and has a very stern appearance. The villagers greatly respected Bao for his age and upright character. Unexpectedly, Bao harbored evil intentions and engaged in beastly behavior. For any student in the tutoring school with slightly better looks, Bao would sodomize them. Some of the sodomized students, fearing his sternness, dared not resist, while the cunning ones turned to take advantage of his favor and could play at leisure. As a result, over the past three or four years, the number of sodomized students has reached more than ten without being discovered. Recently, a student, unable to bear the abuse, revealed the secret to his family. Considering that it was inhumane and harmful to public morals, Wu and others, who had hired Bao, filed a lawsuit with the Zhenjiang District Court, charging Bao with harming public morals and having him arrested. This morning (the 30th), the court convened and examined several students separately. It was confirmed that there were injuries. However, Bao denied the charges with evasive words. The court has now remanded Bao in custody, pending severe punishment.</p>

<p>▲ Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Large Quantity of Japanese Goods  Since Bao Xiaocang used the name of the Pinghu County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to accept bribes, its reputation has sharply declined. Various treacherous merchants took the opportunity to go to Shanghai to purchase Japanese goods. Yesterday, a message from Shanghai stated that thirty-five loads of Japanese fish, loaded on a wheeled vehicle, were on their way. The Anti-Japanese Association immediately dispatched official Yu Pinzhang to guard the port with police officers. In the evening, the vehicle arrived, and dozens of porters rushed to the boat to carry the Japanese goods. Yu tried to stop them and was almost beaten up by the porters. Fortunately, the police officers saw the opportunity, drew their guns, and aimed at the ringleaders, and the crowd stood still with their hands down. As a result, all the Japanese fish were seized and sent to the association. At the same time, searches were conducted in various stores, and more than one thousand catties of Japanese fish, countless boxes of Ren Dan pills, several bolts of silk cloth, and several pieces of Meihua Socks Factory's Three Tigers brand Japanese yarn were seized. All of these were newly arrived goods and were sealed and confiscated. They will be severely punished in accordance with regulations at the next meeting. The general merchants were greatly frightened and hid their smuggled goods, appearing very embarrassed.</p>

<p>Some Personal Views on University Character Education</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Shao Wu Jiu</p>
<p>(2) Breaking Abstract Character Education Goals</p>
<p>Speaking of the goals of university character education, they are very important, because good goals can create a good atmosphere in a school. Abstract character education goals are almost formal rather than practical. Administrators find them difficult to implement, and students often adopt a perfunctory attitude. Based on my daily observations of the results of character education in general universities, I believe there is an urgent need for improvement. To set character education goals, one should first examine the history of the school and pay attention to the environment in which the students are located. Base it on the facts, and then refer to the same goals set by various universities, learn from their strengths and make up for their weaknesses, so as to facilitate implementation. Only with such a plan can it not violate the facts and educational principles, and can it imperceptibly cultivate a scientific spirit and achieve the goal of scientific training.</p>
<p>(3) Breaking Rigid Character Education Methods</p>
<p>In the past, university character education methods either advocated strictness or laissez-faire, both of which were too subjective. I'm afraid they cannot be applied to or are suitable for university character education methods. According to my understanding of the situation of university students, their ability to self-govern and their knowledge are both higher than middle school students. As for experience, university students feel that they lack it. Therefore, our attention to university character education methods is much more complex than that of middle schools. I believe that character education methods should pay attention to the following: A. Do not adopt rigid regulations and methods to supervise students. B. Arouse students' interest anytime, anywhere. C. Guide students on the experience needed in life. D. Instructors and students should become one, so that true cooperation between teachers and students will have a greater effect. E. I hope to create all-round talents among university students who will serve the country and society. In short, character education methods are flexible, not rigid. Perhaps they can be improved at any time depending on the school's situation and the students' needs.</p>
<p>I dare not say that the above three points are immutable truths, but I always feel that there is a fundamental need to study the issue of university character education. I am especially stating my views briefly and would like to ask the leaders to correct me. (The End)</p>

<p>Xu Peihuang Transferred to Special Commissioner of the Municipal Government</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, yesterday issued a special order transferring Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, to Special Commissioner of the Municipal Government, and appointed Pan Gongzhan to fill the vacancy. Mr. Pan previously served as Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for many years and made significant contributions. Xu, after receiving the order yesterday, has ordered the various officials in the bureau to prepare for the handover and resigned as Special Commissioner of the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Xu Peihuang Gave a Talk Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Regarding His Transfer as Director of the Education Bureau by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, gave the following statement to reporters:</p>
<p>Nearly two years ago (October 16, 1930), the future of education in Shanghai was bleak, and municipal construction was a major obstacle. Former Mayor Zhang Yuejun saw this and was deeply worried. Without seeking my consent in advance, he ordered me to clean up the mess and reorganize it. Seeing that the road ahead was full of thorns, I initially dared not agree. However, I was moved by Mr. Zhang's sincerity and, for the sake of Shanghai's municipal administration and citizens, decided to sacrifice all my personal opinions and resolutely agreed. Moreover, for the sake of the future of education in Shanghai, as a member of the nation, I could not shirk my duty. After taking office, I realized that the content was even more complex. In terms of internal administration, things were done slackly, spirits were dissipated, and public funds were half wasted. Everything was deeply ingrained and difficult to reverse. In terms of external affairs, there were complaints everywhere, public opinion was boiling, the hardships of teachers and staff in municipal schools had no way to appeal, and bad elements held guns to demonstrate to the officials in the bureau or made intimidating statements to maintain their positions. Private schools were full of criticism of the bureau. Matters related to guidance and inspection were not considered at all. In short, discipline, laws, and administrative efficiency could not be implemented in the Education Bureau. Former Mayor Zhang insightfully diagnosed the problem and ordered me to be the doctor. However, the disease had penetrated deep into the bones. To cure it quickly would be fatal, and to not cure it would also be fatal. My talent and knowledge are shallow, and I feel especially guilty. I could only do what I could within my sight, treating the symptoms in stages. Fortunately, with the guidance of former Mayor Zhang and Mayor Wu, there has been a gradual improvement both inside and out in less than two years. However, it has not yet escaped the state of illness. I have long been mentally and physically exhausted and should have resigned long ago. However, I have always been loyal to my duty, abided by the law, and handled affairs with conscience. I have asked myself and have no shame. Since I have been ordered by former Mayor Zhang and Mayor Wu, I only know to do my best for the party and the country and to build the municipal administration. I have ignored all the slanders from the outside. However, I recently received an oral instruction from Mayor Wu, saying that he has decided to transfer me to the Municipal Government as a Special Commissioner and told me that the transfer was not because of my lack of ability or lack of achievement in my work, but because the party and the country value education above all else, and the party and education should be one. He felt that it would be more appropriate for me to be transferred to the position of Special Commissioner. After hearing this, I was extremely ashamed, because I have been in office for two years and have felt guilty for not making any achievements, but the mayor did not criticize me but instead protected me and transferred me to the position of Special Commissioner to plan for the renewal of the Education Bureau. I am deeply grateful in my heart. However, I have spared no effort to follow the educational goals and all the laws and regulations of the party and the country. I am simply unable to fully convince everyone of my sincerity, resulting in this outcome. As for the responsibilities of the Special Commissioner, they are even more important. Education is one of the functions of the municipal government, and I am not yet able to handle it. How dare I be a mere figurehead in such an important position? Therefore, I have firmly declined to Mayor Wu. I came to serve the party and the country, and now I am leaving under the orders of the party and the country, and I feel very happy.</p>

Greece, as the originator of the Games, was placed at the head of the procession, followed by countries in alphabetical order. The American team, as hosts, was last. Each team was led by a commissioner carrying the country's name flag, followed by the flag bearer, eight steps behind. Next came the officials, female athletes, and then male athletes. As each team passed the reviewing stand, they all raised their hands in salute. The American team, with over 400 members, marched in perfect unison, taking the longest time to pass. After the procession, they lined up in the stadium in order, combining with the spectators and athletes to fill the stadium into a fleshy, barrel shape. It was truly a magnificent sight.</p>

<p>After the representatives of each country were lined up, the chairman of the Games invited the US Vice President Coolidge to formally declare the opening. The speech was only about twenty words, to save time. After the speech, the flags were raised, the torch was lit, and the Games anthem was played. Two thousand light balloons, representing world peace, flew all over the field. Ten cannons were fired, signifying the 10th Games. A choir of 5,000 people sang the Games anthem in unison, their voices reaching the clouds. After the ceremony, they lined up to leave the field in orderly fashion, taking only two hours. This has to be admired for the careful planning and organization, being swift and efficient, truly perfect.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Exceptionally Thoughtful Venue Arrangement <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The seats in the stands were all numbered. There were two entrances. Although there were many spectators, there was no jostling or crowding. In and around the venue, in addition to the military police stationed at various points, there were also uniformed college students everywhere maintaining order. The construction of the loudspeakers was excellent, the sound was very loud, and even the highest corners of the stands could hear clearly. There were many speakers, but their speeches were short and to the point.</p>

<p>A commissioner specially appointed by the Games led the way with the country's name flag, followed by Liu Changchun carrying the national flag, then the chief representative. Following them were four representatives: Song Junfu, Liu Xuesong, Shen Guoquan, and Tuoping. The delegation consisted of six people. However, there were also smaller "Chinese" delegations. Although this was our country's first time participating, it attracted much attention from people of various countries. Dr. Huang, the Consul General in San Francisco, and his wife, sat in the honorary seats, participating in the grand opening ceremony. Therefore, it is gratifying that our country, with such a small delegation, could join the world's nations in the Games and receive equal honor.</p>

<p>The image above shows the 200-meter preliminary race, approaching the finish line. The runner in the fourth lane is first, namely the American Metcalfe. The runner in the first lane is second, the Canadian Laide. The runner in the third lane is third, the New Zealander Pollock. The runner in the second lane, Liu Changchun, is fourth. However, looking at the photo, the difference is very small, proving Mr. Liu's efforts. (From Song Junfu in Los Angeles))</p>

<p>Liu Changchun is the first athlete from our country to participate in the World Olympic Games. In the 100-meter race, he was placed in the second preliminary group. He started very well, leading for 50 meters. However, because he had only landed two days before and lacked practice, he could not maintain his original position in the last 50 meters and was overtaken, finishing fourth (there were six people in the group). In the 200-meter preliminary race on the second day, he finished fourth. He had a poor start, so he couldn't catch up. He failed to qualify for the semi-finals. Judging from Mr. Liu's usual performance, he strived extremely hard in this Games. If he could be in better physical condition, he could have given a better performance.</p>
<p>More details about the track and field events will be reported next time.</p>

<p>Result: Straight Sets</p>
<p>Lin Baohua vs. Pai Laituo Unfinished Due to Rain</p>
<p>In the preliminary round of the advanced singles of the lawn tennis tournament, Zheng Zhaojia vs. Tu Kaiyuan, and Lin Baohua vs. Pai Laituo, were played at the China Tennis Courts yesterday. As a result, Zheng won against Tu with scores of 6-3, 6-3, 6-1. Lin vs. Pai Laituo started later, and was interrupted by a torrential downpour, so the match could not be finished. The scores already achieved were 6-1, 6-3, 3-2, with Lin in the lead.</p>
<p>The Zheng-Tu match was full of highlights. Zheng's forehand and backhand shots were fierce and accurate, with few mistakes. Tu's performance was particularly cautious, with occasional masterpieces. Therefore, the competition was quite intense.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua, due to an unhealed foot injury, was not good at running, and only won by using clever shots of varying distance. His opponent's skills were still commendable, and there were also good performances from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Japanese Third Fleet Concentration Rumor Denied by Japanese Consul Shirai <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Shibunsha reports that since Commander Sugisaka of the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai issued two announcements and declarations to reassure the expatriates, the people of this city have once again felt deeply uneasy. And in recent days, reports have carried news that the Japanese Naval Ministry ordered the Third Fleet to concentrate in Shanghai to demonstrate against us, and that the Japanese army is laying military telephone lines in the western part of Shanghai, which has led to even more rumors. Residents of Zhabei were startled several times in one night. In order to clarify the true situation, a reporter from Shibunsha specially drove to the Japanese Consulate General yesterday to visit Japanese Vice Consul Shirai and inquired about the details. The following is a record of his conversation.</p>
<p>▲ Denies Third Fleet Concentration in Shanghai - According to Japanese Vice Consul Shirai's conversation with a Shibunsha reporter, the Third Fleet's arrival in Shanghai was after the January 28th Incident. Before January 28th, Japan only had the First and Second Overseas Fleets in China. When the incident occurred, the Naval Ministry feared that the naval forces stationed in Shanghai would be insufficient, so it dispatched the Third Fleet, led by Vice Admiral Sakonji, to Shanghai. At the same time, the Naval Ministry specially authorized Vice Admiral Sakonji with full powers to command the First and Second Overseas Fleets. He was ordered to go to the Yangtze River, Qingdao, North China, and other areas to garrison. After arriving in Shanghai, in order to inspect the internal situation of the two overseas fleets, Sakonji set off on the Izumo flagship in early August to inspect his troops. It has been more than ten days, and the mission is about to end, so Sakonji has departed from Hankou to return to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port in the next few days. He (Shirai referring to himself) has not heard anything about the rumor that the Japanese Naval Ministry has sent a telegram ordering the Third Fleet to concentrate in Shanghai to demonstrate against China. However, Sakonji is the commander of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai, and it is his duty to inspect the warships. Therefore, after Sakonji returns to Shanghai, he may hold a general inspection of the fleet stationed in Shanghai, but it is not known. But I dare to declare responsibly that it has nothing to do with the current situation. As for the rumors that the warships of the Third Fleet have gradually left Shanghai, they are not entirely true. The various rumors should not be deeply believed.</p>
<p>▲ Laying Telephone Lines to Facilitate Communication - Regarding the recent issue of the Japanese army laying military telephone lines in the western part of Shanghai, the main reason is to facilitate communication, and it does not contain the slightest military purpose. Shirai said to this point, and the reporter immediately questioned him, "What kind of telegrams are you referring to when you say 'communication'?" Shirai thought for a long time and suddenly replied, "Military telegrams." The reporter then questioned him again, "Since you admit that there is absolutely no dangerous event occurring in Shanghai, then laying military telephone lines, at the very least, is suspected of demonstrating against China." Shirai then smiled and replied, "This is what the naval authorities are doing, and it is not something I should know."</p>
<p>▲ Troop Transfers Are a Normal Matter - Shirai also claimed that the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai have sufficient capacity to protect the safety of the expatriates, and there is absolutely no need to send more troops to Shanghai. The rumor that 500 people will be transferred to Shanghai should not be deeply believed. Troop transfers are a normal matter, so the comings and goings of Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai are purely for the purpose of troop transfers. For example, if 500 people come today, 500 people will leave tomorrow, alternating with each other, and there is no increase in numbers. A few days ago, although 300 marines arrived in Shanghai, 300 people returned home on the Baohu flagship the next day. This is clear proof, and so on.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Marines Will Arrive in Shanghai in the Next Few Days - After the reporter finished the above conversation with Japanese Vice Consul Shirai, he immediately left and went to the Japanese military institutions to conduct a detailed investigation. He learned that in the next three days, more than 300 Japanese marines will indeed arrive in Shanghai one after another, and that this arrival is not an alternation with the troops stationed in Shanghai. As for the rumors that all the warships of the Third Fleet will be transferred to Shanghai to facilitate Sakonji's general inspection, they also exist.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Patrols in the Hongkou Area Are Still Strict - When the reporter slowly returned, passing through the area where Japanese expatriates live along North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, he saw several Japanese marines, fully armed, patrolling back and forth, and saw a team of machine guns speeding eastward. Many Japanese police groups organized by Japanese ronin were also found. At the entrance of each Japanese business, there was a member of the group standing guard to protect it.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Japanese Version of Shanghai Security <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Army Only Protecting Expatriates</p>
<p>Rumors Not Worth Believing</p>
<p>Japanese marines are organizing Japanese police teams in the Hongkou area, patrolling from time to time, and inspecting the Zhabei war zone for several days, which has caused unease among Chinese citizens. According to Japanese sources, since the September 18th Incident, Japan's military expenditure has been enormous. The January 28th Incident, in which actual combat lasted for only a little over a month, cost as much as 4.5 million Japanese yen. Recently, the demand for funds in the Northeast is even more urgent. The exhaustion of domestic finances and the depression of industry and commerce have all reached their limits. From the perspective of Japan's economy, the Japanese army really does not want to start any unfortunate incidents in Shanghai again. In terms of Japanese military strength, the entire army has only 200,000 people, and the navy has more than 200 ships. The complexity of the domestic political situation and the seriousness of international public opinion towards Japan also mean that it is impossible to eliminate all of the original national defense for the sake of accidental sacrifices. As for the Japanese ships in this port, only five are stationed, all moored along the Bund and Yangshupu. The total number of marines is also only 2,000. In addition to protecting Japanese expatriates, they have no other mission. The security of Shanghai is not as serious as the rumors say, and there is really no need to worry, and so on.</p>

<p>Fewer Out-of-Bounds Actions</p>
<p>Increased Individual Movement</p>
<p>Translated from the August 30th issue of the American Evening Post, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in view of the increasing severity of the illegal anti-Japanese movement and the activities of the Blood Soul Elimination Traitor Group, which are increasing the severity of the emotions between China and Japan, has taken measures to crack down on them, and it has gradually become more moderate. It is reported that Mayor Wu had a secret meeting with leaders from all parties to discuss curbing the activities of the Blood Soul Group. Since the bombing of a certain bookstore on North Sichuan Road last week, nothing has happened so far, which shows that the effect is remarkable. Although the individual boycott movement is expanding, out-of-bounds actions have been greatly reduced. Public propaganda for boycotting Japanese goods has now stopped. Not only are public organizations exercising self-restraint, but newspapers are also refusing to publish such propaganda. However, most of the banknotes in banks are printed with slogans boycotting Japanese goods, such as [You must not use this banknote to buy Japanese goods, otherwise, your lineage will be cut off and your generations will be destroyed, [If you use this banknote to buy Japanese goods, you will have male thieves and female prostitutes], and so on. This trend is growing.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese authorities have indicated that the anti-Japanese movement is now trending towards moderation, the Japanese consular authorities also made the same statement this morning. Our reporter interviewed the Japanese vice consul today, saying that the Japanese will also actively crack down on all kinds of illegal acts to avoid hindering the feelings between China and Japan.</p>

<p>Using Bombs and Guns</p>
<p>To Back Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Hongkou Citizens' Federation and other groups sent representatives to see the mayor the day before yesterday, asking him to negotiate with the Japanese side regarding the demonstration activities of Japanese ronin, which aroused the jealousy of the Red-Shirt Protection Group. Yesterday, they openly sent a letter to various groups in Hongkou to intimidate them. The original letter is recorded below: We address you, the association's delegation has petitioned the city government to ban our group, which is deeply shocking. Since the January 28th Incident, the losses suffered by our merchants have been indescribable. A spark, which is a boycott of goods, ignited a prairie fire. Until now, our merchants and people have not recovered their vitality. A group of party sellers and politicians will repeat the previous drama, and form a Blood Soul Group, in order to terrorize. The market merchants and others really cannot withstand harassment, so we have organized the Red-Shirt Protection Group to defend ourselves. So-called patriotism must promote the people's free awakening, such as adding coercion and intimidation, will make foreigners make excuses, if it turns into misfortune, our merchants and people will not imagine. Therefore, we solemnly warn your association, please do not show off, and quickly turn around and wake up, otherwise our group will deal with you with bombs and guns, do not say that we did not warn you in advance. We hereby warn you, and so on.</p>

<p>Soviet-Russian Intermodal Transport to Be Implemented in March Next Year</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, the Eurasia Aviation Company's Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai was bombed to ashes, so the company's Shanghai-Beijing route was also announced to be suspended. It has been six months, and it has not yet been restored. According to Mr. Wang Zhiyuan, general manager of the company, told the Huadong News Agency yesterday, that since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai and the National Government moved its capital to Luoyang, our company has followed orders to establish the Beijing-Lanzhou and Ping-Lanzhou lines after April of this year, with Luoyang as the intersection, flying once a week. Recently, due to the postal rights in the eastern provinces being disturbed, we have been ordered to vigorously expand the Northwest route to facilitate transportation. We have already started trial flights from Lanzhou to Suzhou, Hami, Dihua, and Tacheng, and are equipping stations in order to gradually expand flights to the border of Xinjiang. After negotiations with the Russian postal authorities, we have established contact and agreed to use trains to transport European mail via Tacheng. By March next year, we will also hold postal flights near Tacheng to connect with our company. At that time, mail between the two continents will not be difficult to reach its destination within a week. Shanghai is the commercial center of the Far East, so it is appropriate to resume flights as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. We have specially appointed Secretary Shen Yani to serve concurrently as the director of the station. Preparations have been completed, and flights will be made once a week. The flight dates and timetables have also been prepared in advance so that those who send letters and take planes will know how to use them, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Shanghai South Public Bus Company Announces Suspension of Operations <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>All Bus Routes Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers Panic and Petition to Party and Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Company on Xuxie Road in this city, recently facing operating losses and being unable to sustain itself, has decided through a board meeting to suspend operations. Starting yesterday, all bus routes have been suspended. A report has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau. Workers are in a state of panic and have convened an emergency meeting and petitioned to party and government agencies. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Announcement of Closure: The Shanghai South Public Bus Company, since its establishment, initially had good business. However, due to various reasons, it has suffered annual losses. Furthermore, last year the company was careless and had as many as twenty-six buses burned down, with many others damaged. Consequently, business was greatly affected. This year, it suffered further from the January 28th Incident, which further endangered the company's situation. Therefore, the board of directors decided to change the workers' wages to a commission-based system. Upon hearing this, the workers immediately gathered to oppose it. Helpless, the company held a shareholders' meeting on the 29th, deciding to announce the suspension of operations, and hired Jiang Wanping to audit the accounts. At the same time, the situation was reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Therefore, starting yesterday, all bus routes have been completely suspended.</p>
<p>▲Workers' Meeting: After the shareholders' meeting decided to suspend operations, all the workers panicked upon hearing the news. They immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that (1) if the company suspends operations, appropriate severance pay must be given; (2) all wages owed during the war period must be paid in full; (3) when the company resumes operations in the future, former workers must be hired first.</p>
<p>▲Request for Response: After the workers' meeting, representatives were sent to meet with Zhang Hanting, the managing director of the company, to request a responsible response to the decided points. Mr. Zhang stated that the company had no choice but to suspend operations due to operating losses and the inability to sustain itself. Regarding severance pay, the company was unable to pay it. As for the owed wages, efforts would be made to clear them. The representatives were dissatisfied and withdrew immediately.</p>
<p>▲Surrounding the Factory: A portion of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company's vehicles were purchased from Lihui Auto Company. The payment for these vehicles was made in installments, and not all payments have been cleared. After deciding to suspend operations, it was planned to return all fifteen vehicles to facilitate the liquidation. Upon learning of this, the workers collectively stayed in the factory the night before, surrounding it to prevent the vehicles from being driven out, stating that the company could not move any property until the dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>▲Petitioning to Party and Government: After this incident occurred, the company sent representatives to petition to party and government agencies, stating the hardships of having to suspend operations. At the same time, the workers also sent Yin Changgeng, Tao Baoyu, and Qian Shunhao, the organizers of the workers' union, to petition to party and government agencies, requesting that the company be ordered to continue operations. Party and government representatives advised both sides not to create disputes and to wait for the suspension issue to be handled according to the law.</p>
<p>▲Workers' Petition: All the workers, under their names, submitted a petition yesterday to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting mediation, stating, "Regarding our company arbitrarily suspending operations, disregarding the livelihood of the workers, please send personnel to mediate the matter immediately. Our company held a shareholders' meeting the other day, deciding to implement a suspension of operations from today due to losses. We, the employees, have investigated the reasons for the company's losses, which are due to the chairman's appointment of private individuals, abuse of public funds, and unclear accounts. It is not due to the employees' lack of diligence. Now, the company is arbitrarily implementing a suspension of operations, disregarding the livelihood of the workers. Therefore, we earnestly request your department to quickly send personnel to provide guidance and mediate everything, to maintain transportation and ensure the safety of the workers' lives. It is for the public good."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Joint Strike by All Employees of Xu Chongdao Main and Branch Stores <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Capitalists' Arrest of Worker Zheng Peiran</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Sent Personnel Yesterday to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>The Dagong News reports that the ten main and branch stores of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Shop in this city, with over two hundred workers, suddenly announced a general strike at nine o'clock yesterday morning, and the situation is quite serious.</p>
<p>▲Reasons for the Strike: Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Shop is a giant in the Chinese medicine industry in Shanghai. Besides the main store, there are nine branch stores. Recently, the seventh branch store on Tongfu Road suddenly had ginseng and bird's nest stolen the other day, valued at three to four hundred yuan. The manager, Lou Heming, reported it to the general manager, Cen Ziliang. The general manager immediately ordered Qu Min, the manager of the first branch store, to report it to the police. The police sent detectives to investigate and suspected that Zheng Peiran, an employee of the store, was involved in the theft. He was immediately arrested. Upon hearing this, all the employees of the store were in an uproar, all believing that Zheng Peiran had always been loyal and would never commit theft. They collectively believed that the manager had falsely accused him. They immediately jointly wrote to the general manager, Cen Ziliang, requesting that he bail him out from the police station within an hour, otherwise the capitalists would be responsible for any disturbances. However, Cen did not reply. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, all employees of the main and branch stores declared a joint strike.</p>
<p>▲Capitalists' Petition: After the disturbance occurred, Xu Chongdao Medicine Shop immediately reported the situation to the Chinese Medicine Trade Association, requesting assistance. The chairman of the Trade Association, Zhang Meian, and standing committee member Cen Ziliang, among others, petitioned to the municipal party and government agencies yesterday morning. They first went to the Municipal Party Department, where they were received by Wang Manyun, the head of the Public Education Section. The representatives claimed that the workers, disregarding the interests, had suddenly gone on strike, and requested that the Party Department strictly stop them, among other things. After learning of the situation, the Municipal Party Department immediately sent Yu Zhongbiao, a cadre from the Public Education Section, along with a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, to investigate the situation, and ordered the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to instruct the employees to immediately resume work and wait for a resolution.</p>
<p>▲Party Department's Statement: A reporter from the Dagong News visited Wang Manyun, the director of the Public Education Section of the Municipal Party Department, yesterday to inquire about his opinion on the Xu Chongdao pharmaceutical workers' strike. He said that the joint strike of over two hundred employees from the main and branch stores of Xu Chongdao had not been reported to the Party and government beforehand, and the procedures were not proper. As for whether Zheng Peiran was suspected of theft, the facts could be investigated, and the truth would eventually come out. The Party Department, in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau, was thoroughly investigating the truth and had ordered the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to instruct the employees to immediately resume work and wait for a legal resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The City Government Will Formally Arbitrate the San You Factory Dispute Today <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News reports that the long-brewing dispute over the closure of the San You Industrial Company will be formally submitted for arbitration by the City Government at 2 PM today. Notification letters have already been issued. The hunger-striking workers remain in the hospital for treatment. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Arbitration Today: The labor dispute at the San You Industrial Company in Yinxiang Port has been repeatedly mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau without any results, leading a group of workers, including Hong Jiaben, to go on a hunger strike. The City Government, considering the urgency of the case, decided to submit it for arbitration in order to seek a quick resolution. Luo Pan, a City Government advisor, was appointed as chairman, Xu Ji as the capitalist representative, and Zhao Shusheng as the labor representative. The Municipal Party Department representative was originally Lu Jingshi, but because Lu returned to his hometown and had not returned, Tong, a member of the committee, was appointed to attend. The First Special District Court and the District Court have also appointed Yang Peng and Pang Shurong to attend. The case is scheduled to officially begin arbitration at 2 PM today in the City Government Auditorium. At that time, both labor and capital will send representatives to present their cases. The General Labor Union has also appointed Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai as representatives to attend.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Citizens' Association: The Cotton Weaving Workers' Union of the Seventh District sent a letter to the First District Branch of the Citizens' Union yesterday, stating, "We are writing to you because we read in the newspaper that your association and the Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association submitted documents to the Central and Municipal Party and government agencies, which regrettably distort the facts. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Yinxiang Port area was never a combat zone. When the Japanese troops entered the factory on February 17th, it was divided into two sections. The machinery was moved to the front section and guarded by Russian police hired by the company. The empty houses in the back section were the location of the Japanese troops' residence. Furthermore, the factory's profits over the years have been very substantial, while the losses suffered during the Shanghai war were less than ten thousand yuan. Therefore, resuming work is easy. Now, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese troops have just withdrawn, the machinery of the main factory is being dismantled and moved to the branch factory for expansion. Who says that the economic turnover is inflexible and the goods are unsalable? If this is the case, the capitalists refuse to mediate and stubbornly resist government orders. The facts are all there, how can they be concealed? Your association, not knowing the truth, claims that the labor side is making illegal demands, obscuring society. I do not know whether it is the labor side or the capital side that is obscuring the truth. People in society have a considerable understanding. Your association is a citizen group and should uphold justice. The Businessmen's Association is an organization of the capital side and is not to be blamed. Now, it is biased and falsely presents to the Party and government, and still says that the information is accurate. This is incomprehensible. Our association has always held a spirit of cooperation, but has not been understood by the capital side. Now that arbitration is scheduled, right and wrong will eventually be resolved. There is no need for your association to repeatedly defend the capital side. We are sending this letter to you for your reference. Sincerely, the First District Branch of the Citizens' Union, the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Workers' Union."</p>
<p>▲Declarations of Various Unions: The Shanghai Fifth District Tobacco Workers' Union, the Fifth District Rihua Yarn Factory Branch Office, the Fifth District Loading and Unloading Workers' Union, the Fifth District Carpentry Workers' Union, the Fifth District Cotton Weaving Workers' Union, the Fifth District Civilian Ship Repair Carpentry Workers' Union, the Fifth District Brewing Workers' Union, the Fifth District Basket Carriers' Union, the Shanghai Hat Making Workers' Union, the Shanghai Fourth District Transportation Workers' Union, the Shanghai Hotel and Reception Workers' Union, the Shanghai Third District Cotton Spinning Industry Workers' Union, the Shanghai First District Transportation Workers' Union, the First District Carpentry Workers' Union, the Silk Spinning Workers' Union, the First District Cleaning Workers' Union, the Municipal Dyeing Workers' Union, the Municipal Bookbinding Workers' Union, the Municipal Coal Workers' Union, the Municipal Military Uniform Workers' Union, the Sixth District Cigarette Workers' Union, the Municipal Wax Making Workers' Union, the Sixth District Knitting Workers' Union, the Sixth District Cotton Weaving Workers' Union, the Third District Hydroelectric Workers' Union, the Sixth District Carpentry Workers' Union, the Ninth District Carpentry Workers' Union, the Tenth District Cotton Weaving Workers' Union, the Municipal Duck Slaughtering Workers' Union, the Ninth District Cement Factory Workers' Union, and over thirty other unions declared: "All legal entities in the country are aware that the San You Industrial Company in Shanghai has illegally closed its factory. The workers, facing a loss of livelihood, have risen up to demand restoration, expressed wage reductions, and even pleaded through hunger strikes to promote the factory's awareness. This is truly a rare tragedy in the world."</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It is the final groaning of the oppressed. The capitalists show no pity. The Party and government agencies, in view of this, have repeatedly ordered and advised the factory to resume operations, but to no avail. Truly, the matter is extraordinary. Therefore, the central government has taken extraordinary measures, so-called using their way to treat their person, who says it is not appropriate? But the capitalists not only do not accept orders, do not change their mistakes, but instead intensify their efforts, increasingly intensify their oppression, and major factories make declarations opposing the authorities uniting the capital group, attacking the hunger-striking workers, clearly indicating class struggle, opening up the gradual active conflict between labor and capital in our country, and disregarding the spirit of labor-capital cooperation advocated by the late Premier, disregarding the painstaking efforts of the city's trade unions to maintain labor-capital cooperation, which is regrettable. The various factories and our associations have the same status. It is appropriate to mediate and eliminate disputes in the invisible. How can our country, with backward production, fuel the flames, severely hurt the nascent industry, the bitter group of capitalists, and cause the group of laborers, become a class struggle, and cause unexpected events, who is to blame? According to the San You Company's rich profits in previous sessions, the sudden closure, adhering to prejudice, is truly painful. When arbitration is scheduled, our associations earnestly hope that the Party and government authorities will maintain their prestige, uphold their original intention, strictly enforce, and not let the dying laborers suffer another blow, and hope that public groups from all over the country will speak out for justice so that a fair solution can be obtained. If, unfortunately, it breaks down and leads to unexpected misfortunes, San You Industrial Company and major factories cannot shirk their responsibility. This is our declaration."</p>

<h3 id="e153">Shanghai Shipowners and Crew Members Unanimously Oppose the Method of Examining Crew Members <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation has organized a crew member examination committee in Shanghai to examine the qualifications of personnel in the navigation and machinery departments of commercial ships. The director of the Shipping Administration Department and the director of the Shipping Administration Bureau are ex officio members, and the rest are technical experts. The organizational charter and examination methods have been announced. This matter has aroused opposition from all the navigation and machinery personnel of commercial ships in the Nanshi area of this port, and shipowners also disagree. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Examination Regulations: The examination regulations issued by the Ministry of Transportation consist of eighteen articles. Its main purpose is to have the Ministry of Transportation notify various shipping bureaus to give priority to hiring crew members who have passed the examination. The examination method is divided into two items: (1) examination of the qualifications of current positions, (2) examination for promotion. Those who are examined must submit school diplomas, work experience, and certificates from the captain or shipowner. Foreigners working on Chinese ships must also apply for examination within six months of the promulgation of these regulations before they can serve.</p>
<p>▲Three Types of Qualifications: Crew member examinations are divided into the captain, first, second, and third officers of the navigation department, and the chief, first, second, and third engineers of the machinery department. Those who pass the examination are divided into three grades: (1) Class A certificate, qualified to serve as a navigator on ocean-going ships, (2) Class B certificate, qualified to serve as a navigator on coastal ships, (3) Class C certificate, qualified to serve as a navigator on inland ships. Graduates of merchant marine schools with knowledge of astronomy, navigation, etc., and nautical experience may be issued Class A and B certificates. Those from the ranks of helmsmen and sailors may be issued Class C certificates. Those who have obtained Class A and B certificates may serve in the same grade positions as Class B and C. Those who have obtained Class B and C certificates may serve in positions two grades lower and one grade lower than Class A and B.</p>
<p>▲Crew Opposition: The current navigators and machinery personnel of commercial ships operating on the Wenzhou-Taizhou, Chongming-Hai, and Chuanshan-Zhoushan-Shipu coastal routes in Nanshi are not merchant marine students, but mostly experienced sailors who have been promoted. They lack academic knowledge, but have ample nautical experience. According to the examination regulations, these people have no possibility of obtaining a Class B certificate. Once examined, their current positions will inevitably be deprived, and they will never have the qualifications to navigate coastal routes. Regarding the status and livelihood of all crew members, a meeting has been convened to fundamentally oppose this examination method. The Nanshi Navigation and Machinery Joint Association has passed a resolution to submit a request to the Ministry of Transportation to stop the examination.</p>
<p>▲Shipowners' Request: Shipowners also believe that this crew member examination regulation is difficult to implement. The reason is that China lacks shipping materials, and coastal ships mostly use sailors with richer accumulated capital to serve as navigators and machinery personnel. For decades, they have been safe and sound, and the wages are fixed. According to the new examination regulations, these coastal commercial ships will inevitably replace the original crew members with merchant marine graduates, and the country lacks such merchant marine students, and foreign crew members must be hired to meet the qualifications set by the ministry, which will cause a large number of experienced Chinese crew members to lose their jobs and create unemployment panic, and also open up a wide path for foreigners, further increasing the expenses of the shipping companies, because foreigners' wages are higher than those of Chinese people. Based on the above reasons, the shipowners have jointly submitted a public request to the Ministry of Transportation with all the navigation and machinery personnel, requesting to postpone the examination of crew members and to modify the obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to Request Stopping Jiangxi's Collection of Production and Sales Taxes on Crated Tea <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Production and Sales Tax Has Been Ordered to Be Abolished</p>
<p>Crated Tea Is in Transit and Should Not Be Taxed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance regarding Jiangxi Province's collection of production and sales taxes on crated tea in transit, stating: "To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 29th of this month, according to a letter from the Foreign Tea Industry Association, which was based on a letter from the Jiujiang Foreign Tea Association, the Jiujiang Collection Bureau of Jiangxi's Special Goods Production and Sales Tax collects 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li per 100 jin of crated tea for export. Our association, based on the central government's order to exempt export crated tea from taxes and donations, requested the director of the bureau to exempt it from taxation. However, the Hukou Inspection Office detained more than 3,000 boxes of export crated tea passing through Anhui and forced the collection of taxes. Our association sent representatives to Jiangxi Province to present to the General Bureau that export crated tea is a product that is exempt from taxes and various miscellaneous donations when it is shipped abroad, and clarified the current situation of the decline of Chinese tea, that even with exemption from taxes and the removal of all miscellaneous donations, it is still precarious. Green and black crated teas are suffering heavy losses and are extremely exhausted. The reason is that Russian merchants have stopped operating, and foreign teas are competing and selling cheaply, causing Chinese tea to plummet. However, Director Hu is ignorant and greedy, and does not care at all, and issued a note: (Presented, I have checked the former special tax office's precedents and regulations for tea types, halved the tax rate, and ordered the various subordinate units to comply, and issued instructions in the case. The present is based on the nature of the tea being in transit. I do not know that this green tea is De Hing raw tea transported to Wu Yuan and other places for crating and transshipment. It has always been considered that the De Hing products have completed tax payment. This time, it is handled according to the old case, so it is imported from Wu Yuan and other places, and no tax has been collected. Now, it is exported from Jiujiang Hukou and other places, and the tea tax rate is divided according to whether it is exported or not, and each is taxed according to 100% or half, and the laws and customs are not violated. You should still follow the previous batch of chapters and pay, and do not make mistakes again, this batch). This is unreasonable. Such as said according to the former special tax rate cases reduced collection of tea tax, tea merchants only know to follow the central government orders, tax exemption, exemptions all miscellaneous taxes, also said is De Hing raw tea transported to Wu Yuan other packing transshipment, more belongs to do not know so-called, how can Tunxi Wu Yuan Zun'an all places crated tea, is De Hing produce? Produced in Anhui, sold abroad, non-production non-sales, in the name of production and sales, has belonged to do not match, donations from where come? And that is De Hing produced, already belongs to export crated tea, also definitely cannot levy and, our association has been based on the facts, please to the Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance Military Commission Chairman Jiangxi Provincial Government Chairman revoke, has not received batch rear, and Hukou place buttoned crated tea three thousand Yu boxes, about value 100,000 two, have wind waves of risk, suppose have neglect, who take its blame? And Shanghai City change impermanent, tea merchants blood wood related, panic extremely shape, Fu Qi your association gist, That is, give turn telegraph Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance, telegraph Hukou inspection office, immediately release the buttoned export crated tea, the results should recognize donations, our association of course shall pay, and beg to revoke Director Hu En Yi, subject to the crime of illegal harsh tax, etc. to the meeting, check this crated tea, produced in Anhui, sold to foreign countries, in Jiangxi Province is only transit relationship, so the province's special product sales donations of repeatedly to the central government orders revoke, and has not complied, whether illegal, temporarily aside, Namely only on the province's self-defined production and sales scope and theory, this item encounter border crated tea, is also million cannot re-taxing of reason, and is unexpectedly regardless, merge its self-defined production and sales scope, and also did not comply, enough to show that the province for special product sales measures, in completely different past of Likin, self-defend, is difficult to believe, according to letter prior situation, Only have power please your yuan ministry audit, quickly namely make know that the province, shall product sales special donations, revoke bureau stop levy, in order to fundamental solve, otherwise branches cluster life, dispute Zheng Duo, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce knock Yan.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Approved the Case of Standardizing and Implementing the New Weights and Measures <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in Various Provinces Are Not Consistent</p>
<p>What Are the Difficulties in Using the New System?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the delegates' meeting, requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to implement standardized weights and measures nationwide simultaneously. Now, the Ministry has responded, stating, "I have read your report. Our country has a vast territory, and the transportation and economic development of various provinces and regions are not consistent. If we want to promote and standardize the new system of weights and measures at the same time, it is practically difficult to do so. Therefore, when the Weights and Measures Promotion Committee of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce formulated the national weights and measures standardization procedures, after several considerations, it decided on a phased standardization method. The completion order is clearly stipulated in Article 2 of the procedures, and it has been submitted for approval and record, and the whole country should abide by it. How can we lightly discuss changes? Currently, various provinces and cities are proceeding in accordance with the procedures and have achieved considerable results. Except for the three northeastern provinces, the standardization deadline for Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jehol, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces will be the end of this year. There is no need to change the procedures. The recovery of the three northeastern provinces is a major national event. No matter how far or near the time, it cannot be used to extend the national standardization deadline. The reason is very clear. Shanghai is a gathering place for national commerce, and it is related to the attention of both Chinese and foreigners. Since the competent authorities have organized it in accordance with the procedures, merchants and people should abide by it as a national model. If those that have already been organized are allowed to stop, those that have not yet been organized or those that have already been organized but have not seen results will be even more hesitant. If we delay and delay according to this excuse, the standardization effect may never be achieved. Furthermore, the weights and measures used by various industries in Shanghai in transactions with various provinces have never been consistent. It is nothing more than using the conversion method at the beginning. After using it for a long time, it becomes a habit. Now that Shanghai has implemented the new system, how to calculate the conversion between it and the old system has been decided for a long time. It can be notified to the industries in Shanghai in various provinces to follow it. After using it for a long time, it will be more convenient than the old system before. What are the difficulties? Your request to implement the new national weights and measures at the same time should not be discussed. Please inform them separately."</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Has Instructed the Land Bureau to Approve</p>
<p>It is reported by Dagongshe that the Shanghai Eleventh Road Business Federation, acting on behalf of its members, the 64 bamboo businesses including Rui Da, Qia Da, etc., stated that since the January 28th Incident, businesses in Wusong, Zhabei, and other areas of the city have faced operational difficulties, with expenditures exceeding income. Smaller businesses have experienced financial difficulties, leading to numerous bankruptcies. Based on the above reasons, they jointly submitted a petition to the Land Bureau, requesting an exemption from one quarter of the shoreline usage fees for the Guangfu Road Suzhou Creek area this year, in order to provide relief. After receiving the petition, the Federation immediately submitted it to the Municipal Land Bureau, urging the exemption. The Municipal Land Bureau then submitted the matter to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Mayor Wu has now approved the request and instructed the Land Bureau to grant the exemption of one quarter of the shoreline usage fees for the Guangfu Road Suzhou Creek area this year, to alleviate the merchants' hardships.</p>

<p>Xu Shaodi, the representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association, reported on the situation of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association the day before yesterday, stating: "Chairman, representatives, I am representing the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association to report on the general situation of the anti-drug movement in recent years. (1) The organizational process of the Provincial Anti-Drug Association: From October 1st to 7th of the 18th year of the Republic, an anti-drug movement week was held in Hangzhou. On the seventh day, which was designated as the organization day, the provincial party headquarters, the Department of Civil Affairs, the High Court, the Anti-Drug Comrades Society, and other seven agencies and organizations mutually elected executive committee members and established the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association. Mr. Chen Lingyun was appointed as the general manager. Due to a lack of funding, Mr. Chen worked purely on a voluntary basis, and the meeting venue was also borrowed from Mr. Chen's residence. Since its establishment, it has been three years, and the funds needed for various anti-drug movements have been raised on an ad hoc basis. (2) The process of conducting the circuit anti-drug movement: In order to assist the government in eliminating drugs and awaken public attention, the Provincial Anti-Drug Association decided to conduct a circuit anti-drug movement throughout Zhejiang Province, dividing the province into four regions and holding it in four phases. Preparations began in February of the 19th year of the Republic. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the first phase of the circuit anti-drug movement, we specifically joined forces with the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and the special commissioners dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Department of Civil Affairs to set off together. It took more than a month, passing through 17 counties including Yuhang and Haiyan, with over 29,000 participants. In each county, in addition to holding local anti-drug exhibitions and propaganda meetings, opium and red pills and other drugs were burned simultaneously. The second phase of the circuit anti-drug movement lasted from May to the beginning of August of the 20th year of the Republic, lasting three months. It passed through 20 counties including Fenghua, Huangyan, and Xianju, with even more participants than before. In addition to the exhibitions and propaganda matters handled in the previous session, the second circuit anti-drug movement also guided the local people to unanimously oppose the policy of opium monopoly. (3) The process of holding anti-drug lectures and essay competitions: In order to popularize anti-drug education and awaken students' attention to anti-drug issues, the Provincial Anti-Drug Association held anti-drug commemorative meetings, burned drugs, and held anti-drug entertainment activities every year, except for the June 3rd Opium Prohibition Day and the August 29th National Humiliation Day. Anti-drug speech and essay competitions were held in three groups, university, middle school, and elementary school, during the Opium Prohibition Day. Each group has been held three times, and the participants are very enthusiastic. (4) The process of organizing anti-drug groups in various counties: Since the establishment of the Provincial Anti-Drug Association, after two circuit anti-drug movements, many counties have been inspired to rise up. Currently, there are more than 40 counties that have organized anti-drug propaganda groups, and more than 10 counties are in preparation. In addition, other tasks, such as opposing the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Investigation Office, establishing a report system to monitor chiefs of police stations neglecting the opium prohibition, and investigating opium cases and opium offenders in various counties, etc., are not detailed due to time constraints. There are two written reports with more detailed information, please refer to them and provide guidance."</p>
<p>Zheng Wenli, the representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association, reported on the opium prohibition situation in Zhejiang Province the day before yesterday, stating: "In the 3rd and 4th years of the Republic of China, Zhejiang Province was known as a province with complete prohibition. Later, under the rule of warlords, opium prohibition gradually loosened, and drug use began to spread again. After the 16th year of the Republic, although the provincial authorities repeatedly issued prohibition orders, the lower-level enforcement agencies failed to implement them effectively, and the results were minimal. Red pills were prevalent in the Jin-Qu-Yan area, causing severe harm. In the old prefectures of Wen and Tai, in remote mountain villages, opium poppies were everywhere. Although strict orders were issued to eradicate them, it was difficult to eradicate the roots. In November of last year, when Zhang Nanxian was in charge of Zhejiang, he submitted a proposal to the central government for approval and promulgated the Regulations for Eradicating Drugs, which stipulated more severe penalties than the Opium Prohibition Law. Later, when Chairman Lu came to Zhejiang, he paid more attention to opium prohibition. Recently, there have been many public sale proposals. Chairman Lu has repeatedly stated that no matter how difficult the finances of Zhejiang Province are, he will never quench his thirst with poison and open up financial resources from opium. Last month, Mr. Huang Jiahui of the National Anti-Drug Association came to Hangzhou and, together with Mr. Xu Shaodi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Mr. Chen Lingyun, the General Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association, visited Chairman Lu to discuss opium prohibition. It was decided to convene a provincial opium prohibition conference, which was held in the province on August 17th of this year. The participants were the county magistrates or representatives of various counties, the heads of the county public security bureaus, and representatives of the army, navy, police, and other agencies. Minister Lü of the Department of Civil Affairs personally presided over the meeting. There were many proposals. After sorting, merging, and detailed discussion, they were compiled into a complete opium prohibition implementation plan, with approximately 70 articles. It stipulated very detailed regulations for planting, trafficking, manufacturing, and smoking opium. Opium prohibition committees were established in various counties and cities, jointly organized by party and government agencies, legal groups, anti-drug groups, and impartial gentry, in order to achieve cooperation between officials and the people. The deadline for complete prohibition is the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Although it is impossible to predict whether this implementation plan will achieve the expected results in the future, it is enough to show the determination of the Zhejiang provincial party and government authorities and local people to prohibit drugs. This can be reported to the conference."</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Inspection Office of the Flood Relief Committee Has Completed Its Work <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Inspection Office of the Flood Relief Committee of the National Government was affiliated with the disaster area working group of the committee. The office was established in January of this year by Sir Xin Bosen, the Vice-Chairman and Supervisor of the Flood Relief Committee, in accordance with the Indian relief administration method. The purpose of its establishment was to ensure that the work in the disaster area could be effectively implemented in accordance with the prescribed standards. The inspectors had no previous relationship with the workers in the disaster area or with local people, so that they could perform their duties of supervision and urging without being influenced by personal relationships, and the work could be carried out more conscientiously. The inspection scope was divided into eleven districts, each with one special commissioner, one committee member, and no more than ten inspectors. In total, there were more than eighty inspectors in each district, who regularly went to various disaster areas to check the work. If there were any irregularities in the handling of the work, they could report the situation to the headquarters for review. After receiving the reports from each district, the Inspection Office submitted a summary to Supervisor Xin and the directors of each group for review. Since its establishment, the Inspection Office has received more than three thousand reports from various districts within these ten months, all of which have reference value. The inspectors were able to conduct clear investigations and discover cases of overspending and abuse, thereby saving a significant amount of funds for the Flood Relief Committee. Because the inspectors corrected errors and prevented corruption, the disaster victims received more practical benefits. This was all due to the inspectors' usual fairness, integrity, diligence, and lack of complaint. Therefore, the office's handling was excellent and had been commended by Supervisor Xin. Currently, the relief work in various places has been gradually completed, and there is no need for the Inspection Office to continue to exist. The director, Zhong Ketuo, was ordered to complete the closure at the end of this month. He has completed the organization of the work and handed over all the files and archives to the committee for inventory.</p>

<p>Due to the Matter of the Jianghai Customs Auctioning Confiscated White Sugar</p>
<p>The Customs Commissioner is Suspected of Abusing His Power</p>
<p>Regarding the Jianghai Customs auctioning confiscated white sugar on the 4th, the Guangyuan Sugar Company reported to the Sugar Industry Association that Customs Commissioner Qiaoli of the General Affairs Department of the Customs had abused his power. The Sugar Industry Association then forwarded a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office to thoroughly investigate and severely punish him. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, on the 29th of this month, according to a letter from the Municipal Sugar Industry Association, a letter from our member, Guangyuan, stated that a scandal occurred on the 4th of this month when the Jianghai Customs auctioned confiscated white sugar. If this trend continues, it will severely damage the national tax revenue. We have sent a letter to your association, requesting the Customs Supervisor to thoroughly investigate and correct the situation. Since the Customs Supervisor conducted an investigation, Qiaoli, the Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department, who presided over the auction, became angry and vindictive. He withheld the general bill of the imported sugar that our company had declared and paid taxes on, preventing us from extracting and selling the sugar. Such abuse of power and damage to our company is intolerable. We request your association to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Customs Supervisor to correct his erroneous actions and punish him, in order to maintain commerce." Based on this, we are sending a letter to your chamber, requesting you to quickly forward a letter to the Customs Supervisor, instructing the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to immediately issue the general bill for the taxed sugar, and to punish the Customs Commissioner Qiaoli of the General Affairs Department for abusing his power, in order to maintain commerce. According to the report, Guangyuan's request for your office to investigate the scandal that occurred when the Customs auctioned confiscated white sugar aroused the anger of the Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department, who withheld the general bill for the company's imported sugar tax payment, preventing the extraction of the sugar. Such abuse of power and obstruction of commerce by customs personnel should be punished as a warning to others, so as to avoid emulation. Accordingly, we respectfully request your office to investigate and instruct the Customs Commissioner to immediately issue the general bill and thoroughly investigate and severely punish the customs personnel, without any favoritism. We extend our official greetings to the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office."</p>

<p>The 116th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 116th County Administration Meeting yesterday. The chairman was County Magistrate Yan Shenyu. The meeting began with formal rituals, and the following resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) Regarding the county magistrate's submission that the slaughter tax contractor reported difficulties in paying the one-quarter special construction donation and proposed to implement it after the next bidding announcement, how should the matter be handled? Resolution: Implement it after the next bidding announcement. At the same time, report to the Construction Department for verification. (2) Regarding the proposal by the County Education Bureau to designate the County Education Association's office in the new county government building, the resolution was that the housing for community organizations should be sought by the organizations themselves. If new buildings are needed for construction and the site is not within the new government area, land will be allocated as appropriate. (3) Regarding the county magistrate's submission that the new city road and bridge construction plan should be appropriately changed to meet the needs, the resolution was: (A) Appropriately revise the bridge structure at the front to simplify the chapter and reduce expenses. (B) Build roads on both sides of the houses. (C) The front east-west road was originally planned for coal slag. If the dust is flying and it is inconvenient to enter and exit, it should be rebuilt with a better road. For the above three items, the Construction Bureau should prepare a plan and submit it to the county, and then submit it to the Construction Department for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The French Advisor Inspected the Second Special Prison <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Duge Expressed Satisfaction</p>
<p>Since August of last year, the French prison on Masnan Road in this city has been taken over by our Ministry of Justice and reorganized into the Shanghai Second Special Prison by Xie Fuzi, who was recommended to receive the position. Warden Xie has carefully planned and actively reorganized the prison, and after a year, he has won the praise of the French side. When our side took over, the French side, in accordance with the four items of the agreement, recommended Mr. Duge, the French Vice Consul, as a prison advisor. Therefore, the advisor visited the prison many times and was very satisfied with all the facilities of the prison. The original letter from Mr. Duge regarding his recent inspection of the prison is recorded below: "Respectfully, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement of July 28, 1931, the advisor inspected the prison on the 29th of last month to learn about the facilities for epidemic prevention and sanitation for prisoners during this hot and epidemic season. Regarding the prison, the advisor deeply feels that it is clean, and other supplies and all facilities are also very appropriate. The infirmary has medicines. According to the doctor, he personally goes to the cells every day to know the health status of the prisoners and effectively treats the sick prisoners. It is also said that all prisoners have been vaccinated against epidemics. For opium addicts, medical methods are also used to help them quit opium addiction. Therefore, the advisor has no matters to bring to attention regarding the prison, except for the overcrowding of prisoners. However, since the original cells confine three or even four people, breathing is difficult. The advisor knows that prisoners are being transferred to prisons in the interior for execution, but the number of people transferred must be large, otherwise the prison must be expanded. One of the two must be chosen to proceed, etc."</p>

<h3 id="e166">Recent Situation of Porridge Distribution in Zhabei <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Daily Number Has Reached Over 5,300 People</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously allocated 3,000 yuan to the Zhabei Charity Group to distribute porridge in Liuying Road because the poor people in the Zhabei war zone were in extreme distress. The situation has been reported in previous issues. It is now learned that the number of porridge recipients registered by the group has recently reached 5,300 per day since the 27th of this month. The daily rice requirement is more than twelve piculs, which is still insufficient for distribution, so it is extremely crowded. Fortunately, a new shed has been built inside the porridge distribution area, and the location is still relatively spacious, so no accidents will occur. Director Wang Binyan of the group personally supervises and cares for the staff on the scene every day at dawn, which is very conscientious. The porridge distribution time is from 4:30 AM to 6:00 AM every morning. Those who arrive later and are unable to receive porridge are given copper coins by the director at his discretion, ten large coins and six small coins, to show his sympathy. Staff members are also sent to the war zone area to entrust the local bailiffs to investigate extremely poor households and issue rice tickets, measuring the amount of rice according to the number of people in the household, as a standard for rice distribution. There are also more than 500 households, and the amount of rice issued has reached 98 piculs. The group previously exhausted its funds and negotiated with the War Zone Relief Committee to allocate 3,000 yuan, and to Zhang Chengtang and five other philanthropists in various sectors to donate 80 piculs of rice, and to Xu Bingji and two other households to donate 200 yuan. In addition, Mr. Du Yuesheng and others donated a lot of sha medicine and other supplies, which are distributed to the general poor people at any time to expand relief.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Taxpayers' Association Protests Price Increase to Shanghai Municipal Council for Telephone Services <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Large Shanghai Hotel Overcharged 9,700 Times</p>
<p>Telephone Price Increase is Incompatible with Social Economy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, based on letters from the Hotel Association and others, sent another letter to the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) protesting the telephone price increase. It stated: "We are writing to you directly regarding the telephone price increase. This Association has sent several letters to your Council expressing our position, but we have not received a reply. We are now forwarding three letters we have received, summarized below: (1) The letter from the Shanghai Hotel Association states: 'We have recently received letters from members such as the Great Shanghai, New World, Meng Yuan, and Far East Hotels, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company has issued a notice of telephone price increases, demanding retroactive payments from March 27th and inflating the number of calls, making the burden unbearable. We request you to negotiate based on reason and find a remedy.' The 35th Executive Committee meeting of our Association believes that the procedures are not compliant and the facts are particularly difficult. At a time when post-war vitality has not recovered and commerce is in decline, telephone services are a public utility, and price increases must consider the people's sentiments. However, without the consent of users, a unilateral decision was made to increase prices, with the quarterly fixed-rate telephone increasing by one-third and the excess telephone usage increasing by a huge one-half per call. This would be difficult even for ordinary patented businesses, let alone a public utility. Upon investigation, the telephone company's price increase regulations were only disclosed in advertisements in various newspapers for a few days on July 1st, without any formal notice being widely distributed to all users. Even the new telephone directory did not specify it, leaving users in the dark. Now, bills are being issued demanding retroactive payments from March 27th, fully charged. In terms of procedure, this is also inappropriate. Moreover, upon investigation of the contract between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the company, although there is the phrase, "Telephone is changed to automatic machine, to give the society good service, may be specially allowed to increase the price," whether the telephone is good or not has not been recognized by the users, and its communication efficiency has not been improved. The company should consider the economic depression and not force a price increase without the consent of users; otherwise, it will be difficult to recognize. Even if a price increase is necessary, it should be at the lowest limit, and it absolutely cannot be increased to such a large extent. However, this is only for general users. As for the calculation of telephone calls by hotels, it is particularly harsh. Hotels charge five cents per call, but now the charge is increased to four cents per call. Since March 27th, how can we recover the special losses suffered by past guests who were charged five cents per call? When the automatic machine is in communication, it often jumps to the wrong number or the other party is talking and cannot be connected, but each jump is counted as one call. As a result, one call can be counted as four or five calls, costing more than a long-distance call, and there is no way to argue. This is the second special loss suffered. Moreover, the number of calls on the bills sent by the company is often inflated compared to the number of calls recorded by the hotels themselves, resulting in even greater losses. For example, the Great Shanghai Hotel employs an operator dedicated to the task, and every call is recorded in detail, even if it is a wrong number or not connected, there must be a clear note and there are no omissions. However, the number of calls recorded in April, May, and June exceeds the company's bill by as much as 9,700 times, totaling 388 taels of silver. Other hotels, such as New World, Oriental, Far East, Wu Palace, and Meng Yuan, large and small, more than a hundred in total, are all in the same situation. This is the third special loss suffered. If a remedy is not implemented as soon as possible, the intangible losses will be unbearable. The original cause for recording and charging in public places was that there were too many calls, making it difficult for the operators to handle. Therefore, this method was established to limit the number of calls. Now that it has been changed to an automatic machine, there is no longer the above-mentioned problem, and it seems that the chapter on charging by the number of calls can be cancelled. If there are more calls in public places, then it may be possible to slightly increase the fixed price. Based on the above reasons, we hereby propose several remedial measures: (1) The company's telephone price increase is inappropriate in both procedure and reason. We request that the price increase regulations be revised as soon as possible to reduce the burden on users. (2) Since the company's counting is based on meters, both parties (the company and the user) should install a meter for mutual comparison to ensure accuracy and reliability to show commercial trust. The company cannot make decisions unilaterally. (3) The company should allow merchants to send personnel to visit the meter and accommodate a joint study of the error points for correction. At the same time, personnel should be sent to various hotels to conduct on-site investigations and detailed verification to achieve an accurate purpose. (4) The company's settlement is based on a quarterly total, but the number of calls is settled monthly. If the fixed number of calls is not reached in the previous month, but the following month exceeds the fixed number, the number of calls not used in the previous month should not be counted, and the excess calls should be charged, which is too unfair. The company should calculate the number of calls in a combined manner to show fairness. (5) Before the telephone price increase and counting issues are satisfactorily resolved, it is not convenient for hotels to use dictatorial means to forcibly cut the line, which will only hurt feelings. If public outrage is provoked, this Association will not be responsible. The above points are essential and concrete measures to solve the current price increase and the mismatch of counting for hotels. We have always admired your Council's enthusiasm for public welfare and concern for people's hardships. We have expressed our opinions and respectfully request you to forward them to the Shanghai Municipal Council, order the telephone company to negotiate, and urgently implement remedial measures to reduce the burden and increase social welfare. We also hope to receive a reply for the sake of public relations. (2) The letter from Accountant Bei Zuyi states: 'It is found that telephone is one of the important public utilities, and the municipal authorities of all countries take reducing fees and universalizing profits for society as their facility policy. The telephone business is very important for municipal transportation and has a monopoly nature, so other businesses should not aim to purely make profits. However, at a time when business is declining and people's livelihood is difficult, the Shanghai Telephone Company suddenly proposed a price increase. Regardless of the current situation, it is not allowed to increase the burden again. In terms of the relationship between public utilities and all citizens, it is not allowed to let the telephone company increase prices at will. The company only knows about its own business and does not care whether the citizens can afford it. It is still understandable to come up with this rashly. How can the Municipal Council forget that it is the responsible authority for the Shanghai Public Concession, disregard the livelihood of all citizens, and pass this unreasonable telephone price increase? It is even more ridiculous that the increase in fees must be retroactively collected in the summer. "No retroactivity" is the case in the laws of all countries, but the telephone company has brazenly done so, which is really strange. After I received the company's notice at that time, I originally planned to refuse to pay, but I was afraid that the company would act arbitrarily and cut off the wires, which would delay my affairs. I had to pay while asking your Association for relief and reserving the right to recover the overpaid amount. I think that your Association has been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of taxpayers, and has always been able to rise up and negotiate on any inappropriate municipal facilities to safeguard the legitimate interests of taxpayers. I have always admired this. This telephone price increase has a great impact on the citizens' economy, but I have not heard that your Association has taken any effective measures to stop this matter, which is a disservice to the hopes of taxpayers. Now, please lodge a serious protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council to stop the telephone price increase immediately, so as to maintain people's livelihood and benefit transportation. I also hope that your Association will make efforts to negotiate with the spirit of past struggles to achieve the goal of canceling the price increase to comfort the expectations of taxpayers. I am very much looking forward to it." (3) The letter from the private Hua Hua Middle School states: 'The telephone price increase in the Public Concession has been unanimously opposed by all sectors of society, but it has not been resolved. Our school is located in the area of Yuyuan Road, a road built beyond the concession, and uses a concession telephone. Now, we have received the company's autumn fee notice, which has been calculated according to the price increase. Upon investigation, our school's telephone has not been upgraded to an automatic machine, which is inconsistent with the company's excuse for price increase due to the upgrade to an automatic machine. Why should we be charged according to it, so that those who do not enjoy the benefits of the automatic machine have to fulfill obligations that they should not?' Upon investigation, the most unsatisfactory aspect of this telephone price increase is that it is incompatible with the social economy. Going back to the past further breaks the universally recognized and followed principle of world law. In your Council, contracts are sacred and immutable. However, the road area outside the concession has a contract for the renovation of automatic telephones, which also stipulates that it must be completed within the time limit. What is the reason why the telephone company obtained your Council's permission to change it? This contract is sacred and has been broken. If you say that there are obstacles and you have to accommodate the facts and allow changes, then the social economy has plummeted since the Japanese army disturbed Shanghai on January 28th. Isn't this a powerful obstacle to the performance of the price increase contract? However, changes that benefit the company are allowed, and those that benefit those represented by your Council must be performed, which is really puzzling. Moreover, the company also wants to increase the price in the road area outside the concession that has not been upgraded to an automatic machine, which is even more shocking. In short, if you don't get your balance right, you will make noise. Your Council is in an impartial position. Please consider the case from a long-term perspective and take fairness as the principle. Otherwise, the company's high-pressure tactics may be able to gain momentary pleasure, but your Council will also be responsible for the major decision.'</p>

Li's birth mother and Li Jinhui and his wife went to the Gonghexiang Pier to welcome her. There were also several other stars, but because it was not announced in advance, only two or three of Li's friends were present. After Li disembarked, she hired a car to accompany her birth mother back to No. 46 Gordon Road to rest. Li was wearing a white silk cheongsam with red floral dots. Her face was more plump than before, and she smiled at people, still with the innocence of a little sister. That evening, the reporter met Li again at her private residence and asked her about Feng's murder and the progress of the case. According to her, Feng was killed on the evening of March 24th, around 7:00 PM. I (Li referred to herself as "I" below) was walking hand-in-hand with Feng when a gunshot was fired behind us. Feng said that he had been shot and covered his chest with his left hand. At that time, I quickly helped him into his girlfriend's house to call a doctor for treatment. I rushed to the police station to report. When I returned to my girlfriend's house, Feng had died at 9:30 PM. After the incident, the Hong Kong government immediately began an investigation and collected a lot of evidence, believing that Zheng Guoyou was highly suspected of being involved in the case. He was brought to court for prosecution. Then, local celebrities were invited to serve on the jury. As a result, Zheng was still unable to get rid of suspicion. However, the lawyer hired by Zheng is still presenting counter-evidence. As for the outcome of this case, the Hong Kong government must have a solution. I am returning to Shanghai to visit my elders and plan to stay for a few months before going to Beiping to visit my friends. I don't need to go to Hong Kong for the time being. Later, the reporter asked if she would re-enter the film industry. She said that there are people who are coming to discuss it, but I have no preconceived ideas and will leave it to my elders to decide. The reporter then asked Li Jinhui, who said that there were indeed suggestions to re-enter the film industry.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Foreign Jewelers Smuggle Large Quantities of Diamonds <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Vladivostok is the Main Base of Operations</p>
<p>Customs Authorities are Closely Monitoring</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that two foreign jewelers in this city are suspected of indirectly colluding with certain Chinese and foreigners to smuggle diamonds to various ports in China to evade taxes. Therefore, the customs authorities are now closely monitoring the activities of these two merchants. It is reported that after the police arrested two Chinese and one French on the 24th of this month and seized diamonds worth 60,000 yuan, the details of the smuggling were revealed. In the future, it may be possible to arrest ordinary smugglers and those indirectly related to smuggling gangs as soon as possible. According to reports, some time ago, the jewelry sold by these two foreign merchants was cheaper than other stores, which aroused suspicion. The matter was heard by the customs and an investigation was conducted and closely monitored. In the past six months, two large batches of smuggled jewelry have been seized. It is reported that the smuggling gang uses Vladivostok as its main base of operations. The jewelry is delivered to reliable people to be sent to Pingjin (Beiping &amp; Tianjin), Shanghai, and other places. Sometimes, a small amount is sent by mail, knowing that it may be discovered, but this is only to cover up the eyes and ears of the customs authorities, thinking that smugglers only send items by mail and do not suspect other methods. Those who are carried by people are not directly sent to their destination. From Vladivostok to Shanghai, it takes four or five people to transfer the items, and they do not know each other. The recipients are mostly merchants who are not in the jewelry business, which is not easy to arouse suspicion. The meticulousness of their arrangement is evident. A representative of the Shanghai Times visited the Deputy Tax Commissioner of the Customs yesterday and inquired about the smuggling of diamonds into Shanghai. The official replied that he could not disclose any information due to the Customs regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Zhabei Power Plant Resumes Power Generation <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's power plant on Jungong Road, Jiansong Bridge, did its best to maintain operations after the January 28th Incident. Later, due to damage to the Jiyang Bridge main transformer substation and serious damage to the poles and lines, it stopped power generation and purchased electricity from the Shanghai Electric Power Company for resale. After the ceasefire, under the supervision of the Public Utilities Bureau, the company supplemented and reorganized the plant. Except for the Jiyang Bridge substation, which has not been completely repaired, the rest has been largely completed. On the 24th of this month, it resumed power generation, first connecting the Jungong Road line to supply power. After days of sending personnel to inspect the high-voltage lines, all the work has been completed. On the 29th (yesterday), it was discussed with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to transfer all the loads of the substations belonging to the Zhongshan Road main substation. All factories and households in the Xiqu, Pusongzhen, and along the Wusong River have been transferred to the company for direct power supply.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Various Electrical Companies in This City Will Implement New Regulations Starting Tomorrow <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The business regulations of the six electrical companies operated by Chinese merchants in this city, including Huashang, Zhabei, Pudong, Xianghua, Baoming, Zhenru, have always been very different. Not only are the prices very different, but the business methods are also inconsistent. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that this regulation is directly related to the interests of users, and uniformity should be strived for within the same urban area. In the spring of the 18th year, it ordered the companies to consult and revise the regulations, and strive for consistency within a possible range. It has been more than two years since the Bureau forwarded them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Last autumn, the Public Utilities Bureau, in view of the fact that the types of power supply for various companies have increased, and the business methods and electricity prices still need to be further unified, ordered the companies to re-deliberate and revise the regulations. After being reviewed and revised by the Bureau, they were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval on January 6th of this year. The main points of the modification are: (1) The electricity prices for electric lights for the Pudong, Baoming, and Zhenru companies are temporarily reduced by one cent per degree, that is, Pudong is reduced to 2 jiao and 1 cent, Baoming is reduced to 2 jiao, and Zhenru is reduced to 2 jiao and 2 cents. (Pudong alone has already implemented the price reduction from January 1st of this year.) (2) The electricity prices for power for the Pudong, Xianghua, and Baoming companies are reduced by several li to one cent per degree. (3) The discount for electric light prices and the level of power prices are unified. (4) The minimum electricity consumption for electric lights is unified and revised. (5) Supplement the minimum electricity consumption for electric heating. (6) Compare and unify the level and amount of user deposits. (7) Supplement the methods for users to request and verify electricity meters. (8) The method of charging users for pole planting and line laying used to be a maximum of one-quarter of the required labor and material costs, but now it has been changed to a maximum of one-quarter of the labor and material costs required for the user's electricity consumption at the time of the request, to show restrictions, etc. In addition, the user's household connection installation methods and several types of receipts related to users are attached to the regulations, so that users can easily understand the electricity procedures. After these revised regulations were approved, the companies were about to publish a public announcement for implementation. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident suddenly occurred, and the business was affected, so it was suspended. It is reported that except for the Baoming and Zhenru companies, whose business is still being reorganized after the war and have not been able to implement the new regulations on schedule, the remaining four companies, Huashang, Zhabei, Pudong, and Xianghua, have jointly published a public announcement and will implement the new regulations on September 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Proclamation <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Collection of Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax for the 21st Year</p>
<p>Jiang Zishu, Director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and Liang Jiaqian, Deputy Director, issued a proclamation yesterday: "Proclamation regarding the case of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance setting up a bureau to collect the 21st year's tobacco and alcohol license tax. The Ministry of Finance forwarded an order from the Executive Yuan to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to cancel the original proposal, etc. This was forwarded to all sub-bureaus for compliance and recorded for proclamation. Now, an order from the Ministry of Finance states that the tobacco and alcohol business license tax in Jiangsu Province has been negotiated and agreed upon by officials sent by the provincial government, and is still collected by the ministry's subordinate bureaus. The provincial government also ordered the Department of Finance to announce the immediate cancellation of the provincial tobacco and alcohol business license tax bureau, sub-bureaus in various districts, and tax collection offices in various counties. It was also agreed that the licenses issued by the Department of Finance of the Jiangsu Provincial Government would be allowed to be exchanged for ministry licenses, etc. Upon receipt of this order, in order to handle the provincial tobacco and alcohol license tax, since the issue of jurisdiction arose, after repeated circulars and proclamations by this bureau, most tobacco and alcohol merchants in various counties have normally paid taxes and obtained licenses from the sub-bureaus under this bureau. However, many still pay taxes and obtain licenses from the bureaus set up by the Department of Finance of Jiangsu, and some even do not pay taxes and obtain licenses, making excuses to wait and see. This chaotic situation is detrimental to tax administration. Before receiving the order, in addition to notifying all sub-bureaus to comply, this bureau hereby announces to all tobacco and alcohol merchants that they should all be informed and must strictly abide by the ministry's promulgated tobacco and alcohol license tax regulations to pay taxes and obtain licenses before they can operate. Those who have already paid taxes and obtained licenses from the bureaus set up by the Department of Finance of Jiangsu Province are allowed to use the licenses they have obtained to offset the current payment and reissue licenses for business in accordance with the ministry's promulgated regulations and grades, so as to comply with the agreement and protect them, and should not neglect them, lest they be investigated and punished. This proclamation."</p>

<p>Renamed Ruyu, Clients Never Emptyhanded</p>
<p>Grandfather Rescues Her, Madam Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Gao Hualin, the granddaughter of Gao Xuefu, a resident of Yugu Town, Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, is fifteen years old and has a beautiful appearance. In February of this year, Wang Xiliang, a fellow villager, suddenly came to Gao's house to act as a matchmaker, saying that he had arranged a marriage for Hualin in Shanghai and asked her to go with him. Therefore, Gao Hualin's mother led Hualin to Shanghai by boat, first staying in a certain hotel in Nanshi. However, Wang had ulterior motives and was actually a kidnapper. He privately negotiated with Wang Laosi, who specialized in private prostitution, and sold Gao to Laosi's place as a prostitute. After getting the money, he falsely claimed to Gao's mother that he had recommended Hualin to No. 23 Hongrui Lane, Xinzha Road, to work as a maid, so she could go home with peace of mind. Gao's mother believed it was true and went back by herself, and Gao has fallen into the fire pit since. Renamed Ruyu, she was accompanied by a maid every night to various company game fields and the Great World to receive guests and sell her body. In the past six months, because Gao was beautiful, the clients were never emptyhanded. All the money earned from the night's activities was taken away by the evil madam, causing her to suffer from illness and unbearable suffering. Gao Xuefu, the girl's grandfather, found out about the incident and reported it to the Qidong County Government. The police officer Yuan Xiang was sent to Shanghai with a document the day before, and reported to the First Special District Court, which issued an arrest warrant. Together with Tao Rubi, a detective from the Xinzha Police Station, they went to No. 23 Hongrui Lane, investigated and found Gao Hualin, and brought her and the madam, Zuo Jishi, to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. According to Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, the case was stated that Wang Laosi had left Shanghai in April, and all the girls, including Gao, were under the control of Zuo Jishi. Therefore, she was prosecuted for the crime of undermining morality under Article 249 of the Criminal Law. He also expressed his agreement to the request from Qidong County to raise Gao Hualin to a higher level. Zuo Jishi hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. After Wu Tingqi, the judge, verified the confession and briefly questioned Gao Hualin, he sentenced the defendant Zuo Jishi to one year of imprisonment for jointly enticing a girl under the age of sixteen to commit adultery with others. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was calculated as two days for one day of imprisonment. Gao Hualin was handed over to Yuan Xiang, a police officer from Qidong, to be taken back to be dealt with.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Fifth District Public Security Bureau Secretary Surrenders in Extortion Case <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Ouyang Hongjun Remains Calm</p>
<p>Claims He Was Not Present During the Extortion</p>
<p>Huang Hai, a Cantonese man and partner in the Le Ye Barber Shop on Xizang Road, along with fellow townsman Ouyang Hongjun and Dong Shengsun, allegedly impersonated police officers at 478 Peng Road around 11 PM on the 24th of this month. They claimed to be searching for opium and attempted to extort 1,000 yuan from Cantonese woman Xie Lu-shi. Failing to obtain the money, they seized two gold rings and an ivory cigarette case worth a total of 80 yuan from her before fleeing. After the incident, the Hongkou Police's Cantonese detective arrested Huang Hai, who was then handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Ouyang Hongjun, the secretary of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, turned himself in to the Hongkou Police the day before yesterday. The police chief ordered his detention, and yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Fourth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that the police were prosecuting the defendant for robbery and extortion. The defendant was armed with a handgun at the time. The case should be postponed after questioning and tried together with Huang Hai. However, the defendant denied the allegations at the police station, while the victim, Xie Lu-shi, and the arrested Huang Hai both identified the defendant in court.</p>
<p>According to Xie Lu-shi's testimony, the defendant claimed to be a police officer searching for opium. They found an opium pipe but no opium. He threatened to detain her, send her to court, and subject her to six months in prison and a large fine unless she paid 1,000 yuan. She knelt and pleaded with him, but he angrily drew a handgun to intimidate her and took two gold rings from her fingers. Her granddaughter woke up from a dream and started crying upon seeing the scene. The defendant pointed the handgun at her and threatened to kill her if she made a sound. He returned the next day to demand at least 500 yuan. Her ten-year-old granddaughter, Qinghe, corroborated the story. The suspect Huang Hai claimed to have met the defendant while he was getting a haircut at his barber shop. The defendant identified himself as the secretary of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. Huang Hai happened to meet the defendant and his cousin Huang Shengsun, who was also a detective in the Public Security Bureau, in Dexing Lane. The two of them asked Huang Hai to wait in front of the plaintiff's house while they went inside. After a while, it started to rain, so Huang Hai also went inside, where he saw his cousin Shengsun holding an opium pipe and the defendant talking to the woman.</p>
<p>Ouyang Hongjun, wearing a white flannel suit and gold-rimmed glasses, remained calm and stated that he was the secretary of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau and that he did know Huang Hai from the barber shop. He denied the allegations made by the victim and Huang Hai, claiming he was not present. He said that Huang Hai had reported gambling and opium dens at 478 and 481 Dexing Lane, and he had informed Inspector Yao and the Western officer Ace of the relevant police station. He denied carrying a handgun to Xie Lu-shi's residence for extortion. He asked for a fair judgment. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the testimonies and, noting that both the victim and Huang Hai had identified him, found no reason to doubt their credibility. He ordered him to be remanded in custody, awaiting a court hearing with Judge Shen and Huang Hai.</p>

After a clear hearing, a date was set for sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin of the Fourth Criminal Court sentenced Zhang Jinbiao and Shen Kunfa to sixteen years in prison each, Wang Shunde to ten years in prison, Zhu Jilin to seven years in prison, and Bao Genxiang to three years in prison.

<p>Rob One Thousand Corner-Cut Theater Tickets</p>
<p>The Central Grand Theater at the corner of Beihai Road and Yunnan Road in the Public Concession is currently showing the movie [Love and Death] and has good business, with a daily income of 500 to 600 yuan. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Hua Rongchu, the theater's accountant, wrapped the previous day's earnings of large and small silver coins and copper coins, totaling about 600 yuan, in newspaper. He also wrapped 1,000 remaining tickets, cut at the corner, in a square package of white paper and hid them in his jacket. He hired a rickshaw to take him to the head office (on Renji Road) to hand over the accounts. However, about 30 to 40 houses away from the theater, near the Gezhi Academy, two robbers (wearing Xiangyunsha shirts and pants, and straw hats, each armed with a handgun) blocked the way. They pointed their guns at Hua's chest and demanded that he hand over the silver. Hua, seeing the situation was unfavorable, gave the robbers the package of large and small silver coins and copper coins. The robbers, disliking the weight, searched his pockets and found the package of tickets. Thinking it was cash because the package was square and sealed with glue, they were overjoyed and abandoned the package of silver and copper coins. They put the package of tickets into their bags and fled southwest. Hua suffered no loss. Afterwards, Hua reported the incident to the Old Gate Police Station and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>Xiao Jinbao, a resident of Pudong, worked as a coal boat operator. Yesterday (the 30th) at 2:00 PM, his boat, fully loaded with coal, was docked on the Suzhou River in front of the Sichuan Road Post Office. A dredging bureau ship, fully loaded with river mud, was speeding eastward from Yejidun in West Shanghai, colliding head-on with Xiao's coal boat. Xiao's daughter, who was standing on the coal, was knocked into the water. Because it was low tide, the current was swift, making rescue difficult. Around 4:00 PM, her body was finally retrieved from under the Sichuan Road Bridge with a fishing net. The body was swollen, and she was already dead. The woman was said to be seventeen years old and worked diligently on the boat. Her unfortunate death greatly saddened the boat owner.

<p>Was He "Planted with Lotus Flowers"? Awaiting Interrogation of Related Parties</p>
<p>Lu Kunsheng, a boat owner from Mujiazhai, Tangqiao, Pudong, has accused his fellow boatmen Xia Longshou and Ni Laosan of plotting to kill his younger brother, Lu Awu, also known as Gong Songtao. This was reported yesterday. It is known that Lu Kunsheng has five brothers. Lu Awu was the youngest and was adopted by Gong Adì, who lived at the racetrack, at the age of five, and renamed Gong Songtao. Now 25 years old, he was married, but Awu associated with bad company, squandering money. Gong Adì repeatedly warned him, but to no avail. Therefore, in March of last year, he requested the local court to allow him to terminate the adoption and cut ties. After this, Awu became even more adrift. Recently, Awu suddenly disappeared. His brother, Lu Kunsheng, based on the claim of Liu Ruzi, alleged that in May, after getting drunk, boatmen Xia Longshou and Xia's partner Ni Laosan took him to the Beixinjing River and "planted him with lotus flowers," meaning they drowned him. When the case was submitted to the local court the day before yesterday, the court found the details complex, and the date of the victim's death was unknown. Moreover, there was no proof of the body, whether he had died or not, therefore, the defendants were detained temporarily, and all parties involved will be summoned to court for investigation.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Lin Shenmao of Siming has been dedicated to chemistry for many years. Recently, seeing that the import of foreign gelatin is increasing daily and the sales are widening, there is concern about leakage. (Note: This gelatin is a binder for food, medicine, and daily use, translated as "gelatin.") He has devoted himself to research, extracting raw materials from plants to create a type of Shenmao gelatin. It has already been effective and has been tested by the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Experiment Institute, proving it is non-toxic and suitable for food, medicine, and daily use. It is also cheaper than foreign products, and its quality is pure. He has applied to the Municipal Social Bureau to forward his application to the Ministry of Industry for a patent.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Tenants of Hengfeng Lane Oppose Rent Increase <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Landlord</p>
<p>The tenants of Hengfeng Lane on Shigaota Road, due to the unreasonable rent increase by landlords Zhou Zixing and Xu Yongyan, organized an anti-rent increase association on August 11th, hoping to achieve the goal of canceling the rent increase through reasonable demands. The following is the letter from the association to the landlords.</p>
<p>To the honored landlords, since the Songhu War, countless people have suffered. After the devastation of the war, all landlords should recognize the difficulties of the time and reduce or exempt rents. However, in this lane, there are rumors of rent increases. Is this reasonable? It is something that should not come from wise landlords such as you. The residents of this association have a host-guest relationship. Therefore, we are compelled to address you, our landlords, with the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Jing, Hang, Zhen, and Wu areas, indirectly affected by the Shanghai War, have gradually implemented rent reductions or exemptions. This lane is located in the war zone, and increasing rents would be akin to kicking someone when they are down, betraying the host-guest relationship. (2) Among the tenants, there is a distinction between new and old tenants. The same size houses have rents of 41.5 yuan and 48 yuan. How can this be considered fair? (3) Some pay only 2 yuan for water, while others pay 4 yuan. All are residents, and the water usage is the same, yet there is such a difference. This is difficult to understand. The pre-war system of using well water for free has now been completely abolished, increasing the burden of water costs for residents. This is unfair. (4) The rent increase has not been approved by the municipal government. The lease uses the name of the "Hengfeng Real Estate Company," which has not been registered by the competent authority. Is the rent increase legal? Can the company be protected by law? There are questions everywhere. Even if we want to resort to the law, we fear we cannot be sure of victory. Moreover, the landlords and residents have a host-guest relationship, and it is more important to work together harmoniously for the future of this lane. If we disregard everything and act rashly, as the saying goes, "litigation leads to misfortune." The victims would be the members of this association. (5) Forcing residents to sign separate, one-sided leases, trying to break the united front to benefit oneself, is bound to affect your reputation and hurt feelings. All of this is a pain for the residents of this lane. After several consultations, the residents of this association have decided that for the convenience of both parties, the residential rent should remain at 41.5 yuan, and the market rent should be paid at the original amount before the rent increase. Starting from July, those who use well water will be exempt from water fees, and those who use tap water will pay 2 yuan per month. The lease will be redrafted according to fair principles. Before a thorough resolution is reached, the rent will be stored in the Shanghai Bank branch on Peng Road pending collection.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Hengfeng Lane Tenants' Anti-Rent Increase Association, Shigaota Road.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Meeting Record of the Restaurant Industry Association <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>On August 29th, the Restaurant Industry Association held its 31st Executive Committee meeting. Cheng Kefan presided over the meeting, following the usual procedures. Matters discussed:</p>
<p>(1) Social Bureau Order No. 1209: The industry should formulate industry regulations and price lists. These must be resolved by the General Assembly. If it is not possible to convene the General Assembly, the Executive Committee may resolve them and submit them to the upper-level government for approval. (Decision) The Secretariat will draft a proposal for review.</p>
<p>(2) Hu Yuantang reported that the Shanghai Brewery stored bottles with Japanese writing on them, clearly goods from an enemy country. Can they be refused for purchase? (Decision) A letter will be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the situation for review.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal to recommend representatives to participate in the Anti-Civil War League. (Decision) Hu Yuantang and Cheng Kefan will be recommended as representatives.</p>
<p>(4) The Railway Transportation General Rules Industry Association has submitted opinions for expression. (Decision) To be filed for record.</p>
<p>(5) Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the budget and final accounts for the 20th year, stating that the accounting year should be prepared and submitted to the Social Bureau for record. (Decision) The Association's preliminary accounting report for the 20th year has been issued to all members for review. A formal document should be attached and submitted to the Social Bureau for review and filing.</p>
<p>(6) Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that someone reported that two fellow businesses, Hongyunlou and Ma Yongji Kitchen in Dean Lane, Fada Road, are still using inferior goods with fishy flavors and claiming they were shipped from Hong Kong, which is a deception. (Decision) Since the two businesses are not members of the association, a letter should be sent to warn them that both members and non-members must abide by the regulations in the case. The association suspects that Hongyunlou refused to stamp the receipt. Inspectors should be dispatched immediately for an inspection, and the official letter should be sent by registered mail.</p>
<p>(7) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is working to stop unscrupulous merchants. The Silver and Money Guilds will refuse to deal with any unscrupulous merchant who advances money to sell Japanese goods once they are reported. All industries should try to report them. (Decision) Inform fellow businesses to pay attention to each other.</p>
<p>(8) Letter from the Disaster Area Industrial and Commercial Reconstruction Association regarding the formation of an inspection team to order each industry to raise 20 yuan for expenses. (Decision) Calculating 160+ associations makes it only 3,000+ yuan, which is too little for reconstruction but too much for expenses. For the reconstruction of the disaster area, there is already the organization of the municipal government's post-disaster relief committee. The reconstruction association has not yet submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation. There is no need to form an inspection team before the disaster area bonds are issued. The Association's finances are exhausted, so it will be discussed later.</p>
<p>(9) Letter from the Aid Patriotic Martyrs Association requesting funds from various groups, starting from 5 yuan, to be submitted immediately. (Decision) Patriotic martyrs should be subsidized.</p>
<p>(10) The liquor tax and license tax are also related to fellow businesses. The liquor sold by our businesses is entirely bought from hotels on behalf of customers. There is no profit margin at the original price but a liquor tax is charged. (Decision) Discuss again after relevant industries have discussed it.</p>
<p>(11) The Association's finances are exhausted. (Decision) A letter will be sent to the Economic Section to urge them to collect the funds without delay.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I have read the news column of your esteemed newspaper on the 28th of this month, which states that the workers of the Pudong Gelatin Factory went on strike on August 3rd to oppose the dismissal of female workers and to demand increased wages. It then states that the Social Bureau sent staff to persuade the workers to resume work. The facts are not correct. On August 3rd, the female workers of the factory went on strike voluntarily for wage reasons and resumed work voluntarily. The Social Bureau did not send staff to persuade them, and the female workers did not join this association. Members of this association did not have any involvement. The capitalists claimed that it was initiated by the union. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction to avoid causing misunderstandings between labor and capital and harming their feelings.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gelatin Industry Workers Union, August 30th.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I have read the local news item [Reaction to the National Games Nurturing Electricity] in your esteemed newspaper on the 29th of this month, which lists the name of our association. This declaration was not listed under our association's name. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Financial Gold Price Falls Four Liang Three <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>▲Heavy Trend Towards Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold price repeatedly showed signs of weakness, but changes were unpredictable. Although there were rises and falls, the underlying trend was fatigue. The daily difference was more than eight taels. In the end, it fell back to four taels zero. The demand for supply from various firms was divergent, and their intentions seemed weak. Initially, the silver market saw the British pound rise and the US dollar stay flat, and the exchange rate continued to rise, so it opened lower. Later, buyers were encouraged, and the Chinese Commercial Bank also made follow-up purchases. Furthermore, the US dollar was firm, and banks absorbed December at $31.875. As a result, the market became brisk, and it once broke through the 700 tael mark. However, it was like a flash in the pan, and it immediately went downstream. The exchange rate was apparently but subtly reversed, and the various firms sold off unanimously, resulting in a sharp decline of six or seven taels. The market was calm later, with only one or two taels of fluctuations. Afterwards, a total of 93 taels were traded. The Heng Yu and Run Chang Yu firms traded more than 70 lots of the September contract that had not been sold out, with a discount of two taels. As for spot gold, Da Feng, Heng Da, De Cheng and other firms sold 600-700 lots to the Central Bank, some of which were hedged with US dollars, and the price was 697 taels. The detailed situation of the whole day is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Early Low Opening</p>
<p>The October contract opened at 696 taels and 3 qian in the morning, a drop of 1 tael and 1 qian. Because the large bar rose frequently by one-eighth, the public and private telegrams for silver prices showed no rise or fall, but the forward rate fell instead, so the gold price did not fall significantly. However, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu and the Dalian group first sold off, and the price fell from 96 taels to 5 taels. Mitsui and others bought December US dollars at $31.9375 to $31.875, and Bing Xing, Zhi Feng, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Xie Xing, Yong Ri Chang, Heng Xing, Yuan Zhao Feng, Chang Yuan Tai and others advanced bravely. It was also heard that the Zhongfu Bank was constantly buying in, so the price soared and broke through the 700 tael mark. HSBC also absorbed December US dollars at $31.875, and Mitsui absorbed October at $31.5625. Until 9:20 AM, it reached 700 taels and 0.08 qian. Shortly after, it returned to the big mark, because Tong Tai Chang, Yi Feng, Yong Bing Xing, Zhi Feng, Yong Da, De Cheng, Yuan Heng, Fu Yu, Yong Feng, Zhao Feng Chang and others advanced and retreated. Although HSBC's listed price was reduced by half a grade, with the British pound at 1.25 and the US dollar at 0.25, the internal situation was the opposite, and the December US dollar at $32.0625 was not easy to sell. Therefore, the price gradually fluctuated by a small amount of over five taels, reaching 94 taels and 2 qian at 10 AM. After that, Citibank and others absorbed December US dollars at $32.0625, and Run Chang Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Yu He, Da De Cheng, Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, Tong Tai Chang and others bought in, and it was heard that the Central Bank was buying in spot, and the people's hearts were uplifted, so it rose by more than two taels, reaching 96 taels and 8 qian at 10:40 AM. Later, Xie Xing, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Fu Shun, Fu Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Yu, Yuan Da, Yong Yuan Mao Yong and others sold, and the price immediately went down. At 11:30 AM, it was 93 taels and 6 qian, and it rose by more than one tael in an instant, and then Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Heng, Shun Li and others bought in, and at 11:30 AM, it was 95 taels and 4 qian. Retailers came out, and it retreated to 93 taels and 7 qian. At noon, it closed at 94 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>▲Calm Afternoon Market</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 94 taels and 2 qian, followed by 94 taels and 3.3 qian. Zhi Feng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Yong Feng and others bought in, pulling it up by one tael to 94 taels and 4 qian. Later, because Zhejiang came out with December US dollars at $32.125, and Yi Yu and others sold it in the market, it fell again by two taels, reaching 92 taels and 5 qian at 2:50 PM. Afterwards, Yu He, Zhao Feng Chang and Heng Xing all bought in, and Hua Bi absorbed October US dollars at $31.875, and Anda Zhi Jin and others absorbed December at $32.1875. Then, September first made a deal at $31.9375, so the gold price rebounded by two taels, reaching 94 taels and 6 qian at 3:20 PM. At that time, a telegram came from India, and the exchange rate went down by a small amount of two annas, but from 3 PM to 3:15 PM, it fluctuated by eight or nine qian. After 3 PM, it suddenly turned weak, because Hong Xing, Heng Yu and British gold bulls sold off, and hedgers also sold off, causing the price to fall again by two taels. Near the close of the market, it was 92 taels and 7 qian, and then it closed at 93 taels and 1 qian, a drop of four taels and three qian compared to the previous day. The highest price during the day was 700 taels and 0.08 qian, and the lowest was 692 taels and 5 qian, a difference of eight taels and three qian. The red bar plus eleven taels.</p>
<p>▲Listed Price Mostly Suppressed by Ten Liang</p>
<p>The listed price has been changed to 774 taels. The US dollar is listed at a small 0.25, which is suppressed by 75 taels to 8 taels. In the afternoon, it was 81 taels to 80 taels, which was 10 taels more suppressed than the previous day. As for the accounts for this month, they have been squared off and are not counted. September and October are counted together at 95 taels. The water compensation was 95 taels in the morning and 93 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Active Transactions</p>
<p>The on-the-ground transactions were quite active, but the receipts and payments were very chaotic. According to statistics, Bing Xing, Heng Xing Yuan, and Da De Cheng bought the most, and Zhao Feng Chang, Yuan Heng, and Da Xing Yong also bought in slightly, each accounting for 100-200 lots. Shun Li, Wan Xing, Heng Yu, Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, Xie Xing Yong, Yuan Chun, and Yi Feng Yong had varying amounts of receipts and payments. Fu Yu, Fu Chang, Yong Feng, Yu He, Hong Kang Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Xing and others all sold. Yuan Mao Yong and Zhi Feng Yong sold 200-300 lots. Tong Tai Chang sold about 1,100-1,200 lots, and 700 lots were settled out. Hui Xiang and Yuan Kang Xiang both bought in (said to be buying in on behalf of Zhongfu). In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong initially bought in and then sold out, and Yong Feng, Heng Xing, Yu He, Heng Xing Yuan, Yi Feng Yong, and Zhao Feng Chang all bought in. Yi Yu, Hong Xing, and Fu Xing Yong sold out. Some short sellers bought in to cover their positions, so the market price was not greatly affected. On the same day, the Dalian gang had a total of more than 1,000 lots, with similar receipts and payments. The Guangdong gang had about 400 lots of receipts and payments. The amount of lots of each firm decreased again, totaling more than 23,000.</p>

<p>Bank Transactions Not Weak</p>
<p>Gold Firms Mostly Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw the British pound rise and the US dollar stay flat. However, international market conditions trended differently. The large bar should have been seen to shrink, but it did not and instead lengthened. The US silver spot price had no rise or fall, and the futures price showed a slight recovery. The exchange rate continued to rise, so the Shanghai market was still apparently but subtly reversed. HSBC's listed price was reduced by half a grade, with the British pound at 0.125 and the US dollar at 0.25. Hong Kong returned a small 0.125, and the rest were reduced accordingly. However, the internal market was the opposite, first loose and then firm, and then withered again at noon. In the afternoon, the results were cumulatively deficient, and compared with the day before, the British pound rose by 0.125 and the US dollar rose by 0.25. The gold price fell as a result, but the fluctuations throughout the day were unstoppable. Transactions in various banks were not uncommon. The British pound was no more than tens of thousands of pounds. The Bombay trading firm bought in some pounds for January of next year. The US dollar was about 500,000-600,000 yuan. The buying intentions of various banks were still strong, and most of the gold industry was selling off, but Guang Bang Sheng Da had a slight settlement. Some were settling back the notes, and the settlement price was suppressed by as much as 80 taels.</p>
<p>▲British Exchange Rate</p>
<p>The internal market only fluctuated by 0.0625. The selling price opened in the morning at 1 shilling 9 pence 8125, to 10 pence 0625. The buying price was 9 pence 875 to 10 pence 125. The closing price was quoted at 9 pence 875 to 10 pence 125. The buying price was 9 pence 9375 to 10 pence 1875.</p>
<p>▲US Exchange Rate</p>
<p>The internal market fluctuated by 0.1875. The morning opening price was 31.5625 yuan for August, 31.625 yuan for September, 31.75 yuan for October, 31.875 yuan for November, and 32 yuan for December. The buying price was increased by 0.125 yuan per month. The closing selling price at noon was 31.50 yuan to 31.9375 yuan, and the buying price was 32.1625 yuan to 32.0625 yuan. The closing selling price in the afternoon was 31.625 yuan to 32.0625 yuan, and the buying price was 31.75 yuan to 32.1875 yuan. One US dollar is equivalent to 3 taels 2 qian 3 fen 58 li of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Big Bar Continues to Lengthen 0.0625 <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 30th, telegram. The big bar lengthens by 0.0625. The near term is 18 pence 5625, and the far term is 18 pence 6875. The British-American exchange rate opens at $3.4725.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Foreign Exchange Thriving, Lizi Price Flat <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲Market Situation Prosperous</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the delivery of public bonds this month, the silver and money industries had the usual practice of acceptance and payment, so the use of foreign funds was relatively smooth. However, this transaction is not a popular act of wholesale sales, so the price has not fluctuated, and people's hearts have not moved. The silver market has been stable and uneventful due to the recent lack of use. The bank's receipts and disbursements are also very scarce, and there is no obvious scene.</p>
<p>▲Lizi Early Market on Par</p>
<p>[Foreign Lizi] The price of foreign Lizi was the same in the morning and afternoon markets, at 6 qian 8 fen 8 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, and it was the same as the morning and afternoon of the previous day. [Silver Lizi] The price in the morning and afternoon markets was the same, at 5 fen, which was slightly better than the previous day by 1 fen. The Huatou water compensation was 5-6 fen.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coins Consistently Stable</p>
<p>Jiangnan small ocean, the same in the morning and afternoon markets, was 5 qian 9 fen 5 li, a small decrease of 1 li compared to the previous afternoon. The transaction was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small ocean, the morning market was 5 qian 8 fen 2 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half, and the afternoon market was 5 qian 8 fen 2 li. The transaction was 140,000 jiao in the morning market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were still 433,000 wen, and the transaction was more than 52,800 strings of wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver and Foreign Currency See Mutual Rise and Fall</p>

<p>▲Standard Yarn</p>
<p>Due to the handling of delivery procedures at the end of the month, the market was closed for one day. The demand for current yarn from customers was not strong, but the market situation was very high. Most people still expect it to rise. However, US cotton is fixed and does not move. We need to wait for the standard yarn auction to open tomorrow before we take action. It is estimated that all the buyers bought only 450 bales for the whole day, and the market price rose by about 5 qian. The amount of each party's purchase is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 80 Ningbo 25 Inland 40</p>
<p>Sichuan 200 Zhenjiang 10 Fujian 5</p>
<p>Same industry 55 Total 415 bales</p>
<p>▲Cotton</p>
<p>The general situation is quite strong. The silver price is very expensive for US and Indian cotton. This cotton is cheaper, and foreign merchants have the intention to intervene. A letter from a friend said that Japanese merchants are searching and purchasing in large quantities in Shandong, so the market price there is soaring. The source is estimated to be 272 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>The standard yarn in August was launched in mid-May, and the price was 154-155 taels. Later, due to the decline of rural areas in the country, economic depletion, and the discovery of new lows in US cotton, the actual needs of customers stagnated. In addition, Japanese yarn prices were particularly cheap and sold in all directions, so this yarn was greatly hit. The entire North China area was completely invaded by it, and business was very deserted. The inventory gradually became thick, so people's hearts were once panicked. The lowest price was 138 taels qian. Not long after, US cotton rebounded from the low, and various parties in the southern ports actively purchased. Guangdong bought the most, followed by the Yangtze River basin. This year's Gengtian rice harvest is also following up. There was a craze for spot yarn sales in July. The statistics of each gang buying about 80,000-90,000 bales made the depressed market suddenly turn around. However, on August 8, the US cotton government's estimate was released, and production decreased, soaring more than 80 pounds. As a result, the sellers felt more panicked, and the rising wind was even sharper. The last round price was 157 taels, and the result was that the delivery price was 156 taels, with a residual of 6,650 bales. The delivery was approximately 1,000 bales of Hengfeng Factory's 16-count 20-count Fugui yarn, and there were no other goods. All were self-delivered.

<p>The standard flower in August was launched in mid-May, and the price was around 32 taels. Not long after, it rose to 34 taels. Later, US cotton discovered a new low and broke the 5-cent mark. For a time, the world's hearts were greatly shaken. At that time, panic reached its peak. In addition, the January 28 Shanghai War broke out, and the Japanese factory stopped work for three months. The raw materials were oversupplied. Moreover, due to the economic downturn after the war, yarn sales were sluggish, and there were no transactions in raw materials. Therefore, the market price in Shandong, Yan, and Yu and other producing areas fell miserably. A storm occurred at the Ningbo Exchange. Because there were many sellers and a lack of buyers, it was difficult to open the market. The lowest price of standard flowers was 27 taels and 6 qian 5 fen. Based on the above situation, it can be seen that the world's cotton industry had a great terror. However, not long after, the US cotton weather was bad, with excessive rainfall and severe insect pests, and the market price gradually rose, causing the market situation to turn around, from 5 cents to outside the 6-cent mark. Unexpectedly, on August 8, the government estimated that production would be drastically reduced...prices skyrocketed. This cotton was also stimulated by it, and the rising wind was unstoppable. The market price has been trending upwards all the way, up to 35 taels and 4 qian. The last round at the end of the month was 34 taels and 9 qian 5 fen. As a result, the delivery price was 35 taels, with a residual of 16,500 dan. Half of them were self-delivered, and 7,100 dan were actually delivered. Yong'an Factory alone received 5,100 dan. Lingbao Tianjin crude and Shaanxi three types were all delivered by retail investors.

<p>▲South Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of each gang were 13th and 14th grade, and the transactions on this street were becoming increasingly deserted. The situation was in a slump. Nearly 1,000 shi of new Jing rice arrived, and zero-sale transactions opened at 70-80 dan, with the market price plummeting by 3 jiao. The Zhongguan Su and Tong gangs also followed up with nearly 1 jiao. Changxi North Jing rice arrivals and sales were balanced, and the price was similar to the previous round.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha</p>
<p>There were not many ships coming from the west road, and the river accumulation was still thick. Changxi North Jing rice and Kunshan Yixing rice had few customers, and the market was tired near 1 jiao. The new paddy field has been set, and the middle pass is downstream. The metain貨 is rare and sales are flat, and the trend is tired. The new goods have fallen the same as the South City.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign customers' Xian rice continued to be lifeless. Although foreign rice reserves have decreased, the market is difficult to turn around due to the arrival of Hunan rice. Yesterday, another batch of Hunan rice arrived, and people's hearts were even softer. Hunan rice cargo owners originally wanted to defend and wait for a good price to sell, but because the situation and market shape were not easy to turn around, they had to sell out with the market. Yesterday, a new batch of arrivals and a small number of previous arrivals were sold in the market, totaling 660 bags. Inland gangs took nearly half, and the rest were received by this street. The price was about 1.5 jiao cheaper than the previous market. Foreign rice Xiaojiao's reduction in price turned active. Yesterday, 1,500 bags were opened, and the market price was stable.

The opening transaction price was 14 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, with over 1,700 bags traded. A certain Chaozhou merchant sold the sugar, and buyers rushed in, with transactions occurring rapidly. Continued buying interest pushed prices up to 14 taels, 2 mace, and 7 and a half fen, with trading still brisk. Sellers raised prices to 14 taels and 3 mace, and the trend seemed to stabilize slightly. Fine ground white sugar was priced at 14 taels and 3 and a half mace. No. 8 Dutch red sugar was at 10 taels and 4 and a half mace, with the market appearing relatively stable. Swire sugar factory continued to offer over a thousand bags of bonded warehouse goods. CW mark was priced at 6 taels and 8 and a half mace, DY mark at 6 taels and 6 and a half mace, an increase of 5 fen compared to the previous offering. The HX mark was offered at 6 taels and 4 mace, but there was little interest. Spot market prices were: B mark at 16 taels and 1 and a half mace, CW mark at 15 taels and 6 and a half mace, DY mark at 15 taels and 4 mace, HM mark at 14 taels and 6 and a half mace, and H mark at 12 taels and 2 and a half mace, with the market stable. The Jian Yuan company offered over 30,000 bags of untaxed spot No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar at 4 taels and 5 and a half mace, plus new foreign taxes, which was considered quite popular, but due to slightly damp bags, the price was relatively favorable.

<p>▲Hunan Lotus Seeds: The previous market price reached 57 taels, but recently, land prices have eased, and the trend has weakened. Yesterday, according to a Hankou telegram, Hengyang lotus seeds have reached 31 taels per pile, with each dan in Shanghai at approximately 54 taels. However, sales here have not been smooth, so merchants have not yet been able to approach these prices. The overall market is not expected to fall too low in the future.</p>
<p>▲New Longan: Due to a sudden increase in shipments from Tong'an, Guangdong, market prices have immediately fallen. Over a thousand units of Guangdong longan have been offered, a decrease of 3-4 taels compared to the previous offering. As a result, Tong'an longan has also been affected, so it will be difficult to raise opening prices today.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Methods of Extracting Fish Oil <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Man Qian</p>
<p>Generally speaking, fish oil is a type of chemical product, extracted from the fatty parts of aquatic animals. It has a wide range of uses, such as in the manufacture of soap, candles, leather making, and lubricants. Furthermore, because it is rich in vitamins and contains digestible substances like sugars, it can also be used as a therapeutic and tonic. The cod liver oil currently sold on the market is a good example.</p>
<p>There are many types of fish oil. Roughly, they can be divided into three categories: (1) Marine mammal oil: This is extracted from the blubber, head, internal organs, bones, and red meat of whales and dolphins. Oils from seals, sea lions, sea elephants, sperm whales, pilot whales, narwhals, true dolphins, blackfish, and short-finned pilot whales are all excellent. (2) Fish oil: This is extracted from the internal organs and flesh of fish such as herring, cod, saury, and mullet. (3) Liver oil: This type of oil is extracted from the livers of sharks and cod. I will now briefly describe how these oils are extracted.</p>
<p>Extraction Methods</p>
<p>The methods for extracting fish oil can be broadly divided into three types: boiling, steaming, and rendering.</p>
<p>(1) Boiling: First, the raw materials and water are placed in a pot and boiled to a high temperature, which melts the oils. Then, the oils floating on the surface of the water can be skimmed off. The oil remaining in the residue can be extracted using a press. Although the type of oil extracted by pressing is the same as the skimmed oil, the quality differs, so they must be stored separately in preparation for future refining. The product obtained by this method is of higher quality than the other two, making it the most commonly used method for extracting fish oil.</p>
<p>(2) Steaming: This method is suitable for tough raw materials. For example, when extracting oil from the blubber, meat, and bones of marine mammals, it is often used. The method involves using the heat of steam to pass through a sealed iron container containing the raw materials. The purpose is to melt the oil to the surface so it can be skimmed off. This can yield a high-quality oil that is light in color and texture. However, due to the high temperatures, gelatinous substances often mix in, which is a drawback.</p>
<p>(3) Rendering: This is a method of directly heating the raw materials to melt the oil without using water as a medium. For whales and dolphins with strong muscle and cell tissues, direct heating can be applied. For general fish, sharks, and cod livers that are easily damaged by heat, indirect heating is applied, using a double boiler with steam. This method is the most convenient, but the resulting oil tends to have some color.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The oils obtained by the above three methods contain a significant amount of impurities. If used immediately, their value is low and storage is difficult. They usually need to be refined. During refining, the type and properties of the fish oil, the cause of the impurities, and the methods used must be considered before deciding on the appropriate method. If physical methods are used, there are settling, filtering, washing, and heating methods. Chemical methods involve adding chemicals such as sodium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and sodium carbonate to the oil to induce chemical changes and remove impurities. This is also very effective. After refining, if bleaching and deodorizing procedures are performed, the product and quality will be further improved and become top-grade.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Supplement to the Issue of Gender Equality <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Guan</p>
<p>Respecting men and belittling women is a legacy of China's five thousand years of history. Fine-sounding phrases like "three obediences and four virtues" and "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue" forced women into the mold of virtuous wives and good mothers. As a result, academics, economics, and thought all became corrupted and dependent on men. Therefore, to reverse this five-thousand-year-old custom, women must stand on their own feet, recognize their goals, and work hard. Men's help is also needed.</p>
<p>After reading Zhen Jun and Ms. Zu'e's (?) articles on gender equality, and the responses to Zhen Jun, it seems like the two genders are represented by opposing sides in a war of words. Naturally, when this issue is discussed from the male perspective, it easily leads to misunderstandings among women. As Zhen Jun says, "Old women are slaves, new women are playthings." Ms. Zu'e (?) seems to resist these insulting words and rises up in opposition, but without expressing any concrete opinions.</p>
<p>I remember when I was studying at Nanyang Middle School, Mr. Wang Yincai, who specialized in logic, told us that he taught at a girls' school. When he talked about gender equality, one of the female students complained loudly. Mr. Wang Yincai asked her, "If men and women are equal, would you want to share the responsibility of raising sons equally?" This led to a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Although this sounds like a joke, it also contains some truth.</p>
<p>People are getting married earlier now. Most parents in their twenties are eager to see their children married. After marriage, the responsibility of raising children naturally falls on the woman's shoulders. When there are sons, the love that was once given to the husband is often transferred to the child. This is a woman's virtue, loving her son more than her own life. However, managing household affairs, raising children, entertaining guests... a person's energy is limited. Where would she find the time to pay attention to politics, society, and economic issues? Therefore, discussing gender equality is extremely difficult, but also extremely easy. All that is needed is to overthrow the terms "slave" and "plaything," and stand on the same level as "people" in the family. Men take care of external affairs, women assist with internal affairs. This same principle can be extended to society and the nation.</p>
<p>Because women cannot directly engage in politics, society, and economics... they can assist with internal affairs and help their husbands divide labor, which is equivalent to direct engagement. Discussing gender equality in this way seems to provide a satisfactory answer for both sides. As long as we are all "people" on the same line, there is gender equality.</p>
<p>I am not clever, but I would like to ask Zhen Jun and Ms. Zu'e (?) what they think of this. I have no intention of starting a war, but rather to act as a peacemaker for both sides, supplementing the existing opinions. Please do not hesitate to enlighten me.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Ms. M Excepted <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Ang Ying</p>
<p>There's a custom at a certain university: after the quarterly exams, they always expel a batch of students who cheat on exams (like copying from books, hiring someone to take the exam for them...) and those who fail both English and Chinese. This custom has been in place for many years. Generally, the students who are expelled admit they don't have the talent and don't dare blame the school authorities. But there are always those who aren't satisfied. Everyone knows the danger of being expelled, but every quarter there are still many people who cheat, fail, and get expelled! Maybe it's a miracle?</p>
<p>It was after the quarterly exams again. News came from the registrar's office that many people had been expelled, and B was among them. He was very unwilling in his heart and threw a tantrum in his dorm, "How can this be! I should be expelled, but she's excluded?"</p>
<p>His roommate, Old P, looked at him in surprise: "What? You've been exp..."</p>
<p>"Failed English and Chinese?"</p>
<p>"No! Cheated on the exam!"</p>
<p>"Serves you right! Who told you to mess around with the girls all day long!"</p>
<p>"It really is..." Old B lowered his head dejectedly and cursed himself, "Damn it, it's always that vixen's fault, making me restless and unable to concentrate on studying. The morning of the Western History exam, I secretly opened the English original to copy, but I didn't know that the proctor, Old Cat Li, was watching me and sneering!"</p>
<p>"Serves you right!" Old P felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>"Serves me right?" Old B suddenly jumped up, his face flushed like a cooked crab, "If I'm going to be expelled for copying from a book, why is she excluded?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Ms. M! She was sitting next to me, and she was doing the same thing, and at the same time, flipping through the book and stealing. Old Cat Li saw it too, so why wasn't she expelled? I just went to ask Old Cat Li, and he said: Why would we expel Ms. M when she's doing so well! When I heard that, I was so angry I fainted. It's outrageous!" Old P said, his mouth foaming.</p>
<p>Old B nodded: "Forget it! The world is as black as a crow these days!"</p>
<p>"No! I'm going to settle the score with Old Cat Li!"</p>
<p>"Forget it, Old B! Don't you know that Old Cat Li's son is very close to Ms. M? Hurry up and register for another school and take the exam. Forget it!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! She's excluded, but I'm expelled? What bad luck!..." Old B muttered curses.</p>

<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>From a tall Western-style house rushed an old man, dressed luxuriously and sporting a three-pointed mustache. Judging by his attire, one could tell that he was a gentleman from the so-called upper class of society. As soon as he reached the door, he jumped into the snow-white and shiny rickshaw parked at the entrance. Without uttering a word or giving any directions, the rickshaw puller, like a lively engine, pulled the rickshaw and sped forward. It turned out that the owner of this mansion, who was also the owner of this fancy rickshaw, had to go to a certain place every day at four in the afternoon to engage in some carefree and happy, mysterious activities. It was a daily habit, rain or shine. The rickshaw puller was also used to pulling him, so now that he got into the rickshaw, without a greeting, the puller knew his destination and pulled away.</p>
<p>Clip-clop, clip-clop, the rickshaw puller's soles struck the smooth asphalt road, creating a clear, rhythmic sound. As they pulled along, they approached Zhengjia Wood Bridge when suddenly a crowd of people surged in front of them, blocking the rickshaw's progress. At this time, more than a dozen young people in student attire, holding bamboo tubes in their hands and a white flag that read "Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Fundraiser," were on the street soliciting donations from the crowd. When they saw this beautiful rickshaw coming, they immediately swarmed forward and earnestly urged the old gentleman to donate. "Sir! Rehe is in urgent danger. The volunteer army is fighting bloody battles against the Japanese. They lack provisions and ammunition. Please donate something!" As the young people spoke, their faces showed intense emotion. They seemed to think that meeting this bourgeois rickshaw owner would surely elicit his enthusiastic sympathy and generous donations. But to their surprise, the old gentleman on the rickshaw, upon hearing these words, immediately showed a look of dissatisfaction and replied, "Oh! Fundraising? I'm sorry, I'm not carrying anything with me today. Please go and ask elsewhere." As he spoke, he stamped his foot on the rickshaw floor. The rickshaw puller, Ah Mao, understood perfectly and used his hands to push away the crowd in front of him, and the rickshaw sped away, leaving them in the dust.</p>
<p>After pulling away for a short distance, the old gentleman's heart finally settled down, and he said to Ah Mao, "Damn it, these kids are full and have nothing to do, instead of studying, they come to meddle in these trivial matters. The Japanese are invading, and they want me to pay up. What a load of crap! You think this is a national matter, what does it have to do with me? Hmph, hmph, kids, they take money lightly. You want my money, you can trade two for one..." The rickshaw pulled up to Shantou Road, in front of a house with a brass plaque about the same size as the fundraising flag, which read "XX Brothel." He got out of the rickshaw and ran inside as lightly as a swallow. After a while, a woman's voice seemed to say, "Young Master! This diamond bracelet of mine, it's worth a thousand yuan. They're coming to collect the debt tomorrow. Not paying it would be a loss of face, so I'm discussing it with you, asking you to help me out and save my face." After the woman's voice finished, a man's voice, sounding very urgent, said, "Yes, yes, yes, a small matter. How can I help?"</p>
<p>As dusk deepened and the streetlights began to come on, a fancy rickshaw passed by Zhengjia Wood Bridge again. The person in the rickshaw seemed to have some deep recollections of this place.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Fingerprints and the Last Image in the Eye <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— You Ru</p>
<p>In recent times, science has developed rapidly, and daily life, diet, and disease prevention all benefit greatly from it. Law enforcement and judicial agencies also rely on it to investigate cases, and the science of fingerprints is especially important. The patterns on each person's fingers are unique, just like their faces. Once a fingerprint is left behind, it can be preserved forever on any material. It will not change or disappear unless wiped or washed away. Therefore, this knowledge is extremely useful in solving cases, especially in identifying whether a suspect is a first-time offender, a repeat offender, or a three-time offender. Identifying fingerprints is never mistaken. This has been practiced in various countries at home and abroad for a long time and has been very effective.</p>
<p>Recently, there has also been a case of using photography to reveal the last person seen by the victim in the eye, from the light of the victim's eye. It is said that the human eye can retain images of people seen, and only when another person is seen a second time will a new image be left behind, eliminating the previous one. In the case of a person who is killed, the last image in the eye cannot be erased. Assuming that the last person seen is the murderer, then the investigators can use eye photography to find the murderer. Many assassination cases can be solved in this way.</p>
<p>But everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages. Although the law is fixed, human affairs are variable. For example, a murderer kills someone and escapes. At the same time, someone hears the sound and comes to help the murdered person. This person arrives just as the person dies. In that case, the last image left in the eye of the deceased would not be the murderer, but the person who came to save him, misleading the case. Wouldn't that be even worse? Speaking of fingerprints, someone recently invented a way to use wax to cover the fingertips and create fake fingerprints, which can confuse investigators. Even if this method is not used, a careful criminal can wear gloves of any material when committing a crime to eliminate traces. There are even those who use ignorant people to frame others. In short, although science is good, it is only for people's use. It cannot be used as a rule that is blindly followed, otherwise the harm will be even greater.</p>

<p>Ying is my good friend. He is usually very disciplined in his behavior and is an outstanding young man. Although his income is not very high, he is able to support himself. However, as he approached his prime, the frustrations of his sexual desires inevitably increased with time. He longed to find a woman to be his permanent companion.</p>
<p>This summer, after he got to know many drinking buddies, he was introduced to a woman named XX. It was said that she was a concubine who had been divorced from XXX. One was a widower, the other a resentful woman. The two of them got along like wildfire. At first, they rented rooms, but later they rented a house themselves, and they were like a little couple.</p>
<p>At that time, he seemed to be satisfied with everything. He had fallen in this wicked Shanghai. In less than six months, Ying had spent thousands of yuan. He was not a rich man, how could he withstand such extravagance? In order to win the woman's favor, he embezzled a lot of the company's funds. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. The matter was discovered by a foreigner, who firmly ordered him to resign. This was a bolt from the blue that he never expected!</p>
<p>After suddenly losing his job, Ying was also afflicted with illness, and his family gave him the cold shoulder. He was extremely miserable, so he resolutely cut off his love affair. It is said that since breaking up with that woman, Ying has restrained himself and found a decent job. His family has also begun to treat him differently. So I am very happy for him. This is truly a "rude awakening" for a romantic man!</p>

<h3 id="e224">Different Views on Unemployment in China and Abroad <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fo</p>
<p>Unemployment has become one of the major global problems in recent years. Politicians in Europe, America, and Japan have all focused part of their attention on this issue and are urgently seeking solutions. Non-governmental organizations such as the Salvation Army, the YMCA, the YWCA, and various charitable organizations are also doing their best to provide relief.</p>
<p>Since last year's floods and the September 18th Incident, and this year's January 28th Shanghai War, unemployment has become an extremely serious problem in our country. I have heard that government officials and various charitable organizations have also made large-scale plans, but viewed from the perspective of people in China and other countries, this problem is extremely complex and difficult to solve, so it is necessary to deliberate for a long time to develop a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>However, in our view, the unemployment problem in our country has its own unique characteristics compared to Europe and the United States. The causes of unemployment are also the opposite. In Europe and America, the use of mechanical manufacturing has led to overproduction. At the same time, sales are sluggish, resulting in unemployment. In our country, the economic chaos, the lack of protection for industry, and the frequent natural and man-made disasters have led to the closure of factories and the implementation of downsizing policies in various other organizations, resulting in today's unemployment phenomenon.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the unemployment problem in Europe and America may not be solved temporarily, but this is not the case in our country. If society and the government can vigorously promote and create more productive enterprises, establish more manufacturing plants, and develop sources of profit, then this difficult problem can be easily solved.</p>
<p>I recently heard about the organization of the China People's Livelihood Self-Help Society, which specializes in developing social productive capacity in order to solve the unemployment problem in various sectors. Their plans are quite concise and important. I hope that they will be realized soon, so that society can reduce its burden and suffering.</p>

<p>— Lian</p>
<p>I originally only knew that the Gold Exchange on Second Horse Road and the Goods Exchange on Edinburgh Road were solely engaged in the gold business, but I did not know that a group specializing in the gold business had also emerged on Taiwan Road. The brokers of this group number about twenty or thirty, all dressed in short clothes and barefoot, appearing extremely ferocious. Their business method is to focus on the section of the road near the Jinliyuan Wharf as their sole target. Whenever they see rural women from Pudong wearing gold earrings or gold rings, they consider them to be within their business scope. One of the brokers will step forward and grab the jewelry. Once in hand, they will run down the road.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other brokers will pretend to chase after them. The women from Pudong will cry and shout behind them, and the onlookers will run wildly like a race. As a result... the broker who acquired the goods without paying a cent will disappear in an instant. The other brokers and onlookers will also disperse. The women from Pudong will never have any hope of getting their jewelry back.</p>
<p>Finally, these brokers will divide the pure profit. This kind of gold business has at least one or two transactions every day. It is said that they have also registered to do this kind of business, but now other women from Pudong still wear thick gold earrings or gold rings and continue to come and go in that area. Therefore, this gold business trick continues to be played out.</p>

<p>Mr. Shen Min: I read your article "Artificial Ivory" in this month's Shen Bao local supplement on the third of this month. I know that you are very knowledgeable in science. I have something I would like to ask you for guidance.</p>
<p>The "copper polishing oil" available on the market is mostly imported. Although there are some domestic products, they are very different from imported products. Imported copper polishing oil is brighter, more time-saving, and longer-lasting than all domestic products. Therefore, Chinese copper polishing oil is being suppressed by imported products, and very few people use it.</p>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to science, but I need a lot of this copper polishing oil every month. Imported products are very expensive. Although domestic products are cheaper, the value is not worth the price, so it is more economical to use imported products. Alas! Mr. Shen! I have spent almost a month studying this copper polishing oil, but the results are not as "bright and lasting" as imported products. Not being durable is my biggest shortcoming. I do not have any suitable friends to help me. If you see that I am working so hard and still failing, and would like to guide me, I would be very grateful. I would like to come to you to ask for advice at any time. I hope you will agree to my request. At the same time, I can bring the things that I have been studying that have not been successful to you.</p>
<p>My address is 144 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road. Please give me a reply no matter what. You know that I am waiting for your good news! Wishing you progress, Li Houde, August 8.</p>
