<h3 id="c1">蘇聨的官吏生活彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>關於蘇聨一般人都視爲一個謎詆毁與嘲笑。推崇與愛戴兩者都常是以蘇聨爲對象自然蘇聨是不同於現世界的任何一國他是嶄新的他所奉行的主義及其政治的經濟的制度在這世界還是一種試騐我們且置之不論。只取蘇聨官吏之廉潔犧牲刻苦耐勞踐實奮鬥種種美德而言我們至少己可以覘蘇聨之所以能立國所以日益走向繁榮之前途。</p>
<p>己經死了的列寗不說現在執政的斯堪林在一般人眼光中至少是一個極端的獨裁者。一個濫用權力凌轢一切而厚於自奉的惡魔然而事實並不是這樣美傳敎士艾迪先生在他六次遊蘇聨後所寫的蘇聨的眞相一書中提到斯塔林曾說。「他並不是一人獨裁的狄克推多。他和莫索里尼都當他們自己是一個議會他們聽從民衆的願望與要求他們相信他們能夠預先知道人民究竟需要什麽負擔多少並且什麽政策才能成功。」又說。「斯塔林是一個專講實踐。不尙空談的人。」又說「斯塔林在生前是一個窮人在」</p>
<p>死後諒必還是一個窮人。」果如是不是一個廉潔盡職刻苦犧牲的領袖了嗎。</p>
<p>艾迪先生又讚美一般領袖說。「蘇聨的領袖能夠和民衆共同享受他們」</p>
<p>一切所有的。這是歷史上從來没有的。一切的財產利潤收入。一切的文化音</p>
<p>樂藝術。一切的娱樂與遊戲他們一切所有的或者除丁權力之外都與人民共享的。他們並不要求特殊的權利却反使他們自己担負非常犧牲的工作。」又說。「他們並不像政治上巨頭或是黨中的政客那樣的要享受物質上最大的報酬却規定了每月二百廿五羅布。或每天三元七角五分的黨中最高薪水率。」他們正眞一種戰門的十字軍要克復世界上的貪心</p>
<p>不僅一般領袖是如此蘇聨的一般官吏也如此。美國芝嘉谷著名工程師佛勒納曾參加過蘇聨五年計劃的工作他回國後在共和雜誌上發表「五年計劃談。」有說「着者相信蘇聨官吏不致貪汚。勒索與賄賂。……據著者經騐所及向未遇到官吏能如我日常所接觸的蘇聨官吏完全不願家庭生活個人安適自身康　者。工作時間之在十八小時以上者。乃是通例而非例外我認識一位官吏因不斷地過度工作時常在辦公處量去。因爲與他極相知的緣故。我有一次曾對他略加勸責。……他向我凝視了一會。神色自如地對我說。如果他死了。政府將爲他造一墓碑。上面將有這樣的墓誌。丨在這兒長眠着的白洛夫他爲盡職而死。」</p>
<p>正因爲領袖與官吏都是這樣刻苦犧牲。所以能得到大多數的民衆的信任。對於整個的計劃。都抱極大的熱忱。每個人都供獻其全力爲建設一個「新俄羅斯」而奮鬥。</p>
<p>「他山之石可以攻錯。」我們現任的官吏和將來的官吏。是否應當將上述的事實當作從政時的標準和借鏡呢。</p>

<p>（乙）嚴格招生　職業人才、應求精選、寗缺無濫、藉隊敷衍班級額數之積弊、</p>
<p>（丙）籌備恢復省立蘇州工業學校　蘇省工業專門學校、原有校舍機械、均棄置未用、故在本期内、就經費可能範圍、籌備恢復蘇州工業學校、暫辦高中土木及染織兩科、取初級中學畢業生成績優良志願投身工業界者、肆業三年畢業、並與實業廳取合作精神、於染織科特設織物整理工塲、依工業經濟原則、組織辦理、染織科學生入塲實習、須受工塲管理、與塲中工人無異、</p>
<p>八、整理普通中學　普通中學之整理·分左列各項</p>
<p>（甲）限制縣辦高中　高中之經費設備、非目前一縣之經濟能力所能負擔、故對於各縣中己辦高中者、應嚴格考察其經費確數與設備狀况、如經費確實設備相當者、分别准否繼續辦理、</p>
<p>（乙）勵行中學敎員專任制　蘇省各中學敎員、實際上多以時間制爲主、授課完畢、責任即盡、今後故應勵行專任制、庶收師生意思一致人格感化之效、且能爲整頓學風學紀之一助、</p>

<p>在第一年内整理各項、未能完竣者、在本期内、仍須積極進行、而在本期内所應擴充者、爲義務、　育師範敎育、職業敎育及社會敎育等項、</p>
<p>一、增籌經費</p>

<h3 id="c131">古廟敲鐘錄（二）不除庭草齋夫 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>文化的使者在中國是坐着特别慢車游歷。海亘史遠在一六五六年己經發明了擺鐘，而我們這個古廟裏是從來没有買過一個自鳴鐘。村莊裏也没有一家見過這個東西。從前大家在早晨是聽公鷄的號令起來，黃昏是看太陽落山纔動手燒晚飯。自從我擔任了敲鐘工作之後，大家似乎是靠着我報告時刻了。我每天敲三回鐘··一回在早上敲，稱爲曉鍾；一回在中午敲，稱爲午鐘。村民聽我敲晚鐘就上床，聽我敲曉鐘便下床，聽我敲午鐘就吃午飯，這些幾乎成了村民的不成文的憲法。</p>
<p>有一天，我發現了一件奇事！村裏的張鬍子是依着古廟的鐘聲抽大烟。晚鐘警醒了他的美夢，他便拿起他的槍桿去吞雲吐霧。曉鐘一響他什麽也不管，便四肢攤成天字樣兒躺在床上，一動也不動；脫衣，蓋被都等候着他的小老婆爲他辦善後。</p>
<p>這是張家老媽，沈大嫂子，到廟裏來燒香的時候告訴我的。我於是開始懷疑我的工作。我自己追問自己··「敲鐘有什麽意義？把一個人敲醒去抽大烟……做抽大烟的人的公鷄……這配算是我的終身大事嗎？」我懷疑了好多天，有一次我幾乎是要罷工了。但是時間漂白了這個疑慮。我打聽得清清楚楚，早上被我敲醒起來種田做工的是多數，晚上被我敲醒起來抽大烟的只是少數中之少數。後來，我是下了一種新的决心··假使我敲這口大鐘只有力量敲醒一個人起來種田做工，我還是願意繼續的敲，敲到無力再敲的時候纔肯罷休。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在我的手裏是掌握着全村人民工作休息的樞紐。這口大鐘我能隨便的敲嗎？今天遲一點，明天早一點，不就算是失信用嗎？怎樣可以把這個鐘兒敲得準？我是一面敲鐘，一面絞着我的腦汁要找出一個解决來。</p>
<p>午鐘的時刻是比較容易規定。我看見太陽照在人身，地上便落了一個黑影。太陽在東，影落在西；太陽在西，影落在東；太陽在南，影落在北。太陽在起山的時候，影子是長得無以復加。此後太陽逐漸高升，影子逐漸變程，直得太陽當頂，那影子是變得最短。過此，太陽逐漸降低，影子变逐漸伸長，直到太陽落山的時候影子又是變成無限之長了。太陽當頂，影子從長縮成最短復想從最短伸長之時，便是本地之正午。這時太陽在正南，影子在正北，依影子畫一條線便是子午線，也就是南北線。我運用這個道理拿一根壁直的竹竿，壁直的插在地上。如何使一根竽子揷得壁直？這點小手藝我是從磚匠，李司報砌牆的時候看來的。誰願留心觀察磚匠砌牆，誰都僅得這個道理。天晴的時候，我是等着竿影短之又短，短到不能再短而有意伸長的當兒，便動手敲我的午鐘。一聲鐘響，皆大歡喜，全村的人是在預備享受他們的午餐。……我又錯了。不久我發現有好些勞苦大衆是没有午飯吃。聽得到午鐘，吃不着午飯，這是一種什麽人生啊。我願意不敲這悲哀的午鐘。</p>
<p>内、約需經常費五十元、共計四十萬元、如以半數於現有師範學校内增班、則每班增加設備費五百元、四十班需洋二萬元、其餘四十班、則分潑十校每校開辦費二萬元、共需洋二十萬元、總計實行此項計劃之經費、約共需洋六十二萬元、此項經費、可由整理省經費稅源增收項下支付、但爲謀經費確實起見、此項計劃、暫於兩年内、分期實行、</p>
<p>（戊）試行全省師範中學畢業會　制度</p>

<p>（乙）順應工業環境、積極充實蘇州工校之設備、以爲開辦專科地步、並於必要時、籌設其他工科、</p>

<p>一般酷愛和平。愛國問志。爲遏止内戰。實行建設。曾提出國内非戰建設　　辦法四項。（一）訂立國内非戰建設公約。（二）對於　壞國内和平。參加内戰者採取不合作主義。（三）奬勵和平建設領袖。（四）注重和平建設宣傳。奉商國人。希望共起實行。發表之後。社會人士。不乏聲應。可見嫉惡戰爭。愛好和平。實爲舉國一致之心理。第尙不免有對於閥内非戰建設運動。懷抱疑慮者。敬申管見。順與國人一商榷之。</p>
<p>或曰。政府喪權辱國。與軍閥割據。每不幸引起内戰。在民衆方面。應如何對付。按現在吾人第一希望。即在喚起民衆。感化政府。竭力振作。自强不息。與民更始。並感化軍閥。戢除野心。爲國干城。政府如果不顧國家運命。民族生存。倒行逆施。喪權辱國。則覆亡堪虞。在我民衆。自不得不以整個力量。爲積極有效舉動。軍閥如果恃兵以逞。爭殺不己。務在割據。則在民衆方面。尤當揭發其隠私。提醒國人。採取適當手段。惟二者之制裁。吾人須用非武力方法解决。無論任何一方。有此嫌疑。應由民意機關。（在正式國民代表機關未成立前。法定民間職業團體。可替代之。）裁判曲直。加以制止。設或未能有效。不幸内戰發生。則吾民衆。惟有堅壁清野。拒絶與内戰者合作。蓄民衆旣無兵力。不能置身其間。謀進一步解决。即有兵力。可以利用。試問誰能担保新軍閥不再出現。且今日中國。飽經憂患。危亡己迫無論制裁何種糾紛。均不應祈諸武力。自增痛苦。陷國家民族於萬刦不復之境。</p>
<p>或曰。内戰之因己種。政治社會經濟生計各種問題不解决。内戰不能免。此言固甚扼要。但自經一度内戰。往往政治愈益敗壞。社會愈益不安。經濟愈益恐慌。生計愈益艱難。可見頻年内戰不己。雖其原因。綜錯複雜。至非一端。實亦互爲因果。愚以爲。非先制止内戰。不能談社會改造。與國家建設。而歷年内戰。變本加厲。無裨於國。無益於民。尤爲不可掩之事實。先謀内戰之阻遏。正所以消除政治社會經濟生計以及其他進步之障礙。</p>
<p>或曰。口頭非戰。紙上弭兵。少數人之主動。亦復何用。竊謂。事在人爲。只要動機純正。持久奮鬥。終有成功之一日。從前一切革命事業。當其發端伊始。寗非艱難萬倍。特以精誠所至。金石爲開。故卒能以少數人之努力。喚醒全國民衆。今日吾人提倡國内非戰運動。誠能痛下决心。自顧爲和平犧牲。定能感化國内領袖人物。激起民衆。相約參加。以此緊强力量。遏止内戰。縱未能收目前之效果。積日旣久。必可消滅將來内戰禍根。確立永久和平。惟其能否成功。全在吾人。能否長期努力。</p>
<p>總之。今日中國。水旱天災。刀兵匪盜。旣己歷盡艱險。而强敵蹂躪。空前國難。亦復方興未艾。國運民命。殆己不絶如縷。到此境地。無論如何。不得再有内戰。願吾同胞。抱定宗旨。斬除荆棘。萬衆一心。消弭内戰。奮發自强。努力建設。以大公無我之精神。推進國内非戰建設運動。不逹目的不止。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>吾的老師呌做晁德蒞Zotolio是意大利敎士。他時常對我說。「中國人少思想。應該多用些心思。」吾現在想想。直到如今。我們還没有除去這個毛病啊。</p>
<p>讀外國書重思想。不重誦讀。讀中國書的老法子則不然。專重誦讀。不求解釋。古人云。「學而不思則罔。思而不學則殆。」讀外國書的方法。就是根據這個原則。而我們的老法子。反而將這條名言忘記得乾乾凈凈。</p>
<p>外國人讀書也有一個老法子。考「修才」Bachelier必須以拉丁文和希臘文做必修科。直到現在還是如此。</p>
<p>吾讀外國書。先學發音。後學拼音。發音祇有二十五個字母。祇須將二十五個音都咬準。就算數。覺得很容易。拼音先拼羅馬音。再拼法國音。也不難。</p>
<p>其實在外國學堂讀書也未必比我們好一些。拉丁。希臘。都是文學。詩歌。散文。也是文學。倒是我們四書五經裏有些政治思想。可惜中國人「不求甚解」的老習慣。眞是牢不可破。從前臣子做奏章。勸皇帝做好事。總是呑呑吐吐。肉麻當有趣。說了幾句就不敢說透。照理應該說得長一些。發揮得透一些。加一番敦勉的話頭。結果還是活圇囫了結。</p>

<p>燕京大學假着頤和園舉行歡迎新同學新敎授的「迎新大會」，我也被邀去做來賓，借着這機會作了一次頤和園的巡禮。</p>
<p>關於頤和園的畫片，我在南方便見得很多，所以我站在漾著微波的圓明湖的邊兒上，看看近處的銅牛，湖南的龍土殿，十三洞的石橋，以及湖北岸的層樓，殿宇，樓臺，亭閣，蒼翠的山林，香山的寳塔，全不覺得生疎，這時所感覺著的，是比到看畫片來的明快，並且畫片上的顔色也遠不及眞的湖山來得醒目而有致，於是我興奮地在園中勾留了整整的一天。</p>
<p>湖北岸，靠山麓，建着一條花蛇般的長廊，這長廊究竟長多少？我是不知道，可是照我的想像去估量，總有兩里路的光景。長廊裏的樑上椽木上，全都精緻地畫着花草人物，長廊旁邊是佈滿着綠蔭和花樹，時候正是春天，花朶全都開放着，一股幽香是繚繞在人的身前，幾乎呌你不忍離開。長廊廟，不時地掠過苗條的腰肢，顔色鮮艶的曲線，蕩人心魂的腿條，格外把這畫一樣的美的境地點綴成和夢裏見着的一樣。</p>
<p>我也曾走到殿宇裏去看看過去慈禧的畫像，以及慈禧生前享用的一切，我也曾爬上山去穿過許多樓閣和有着佛爺的院宇，但是結果，我祗在那花蛇一樣的長廊裏停留了很多的時間，我覺得坐在這裏，靜看着花色和湖水，彷彿己經悠然地做了一個古時光的人兒，也像己經走進了裙釵繽紛的大觀園裏。</p>

<p>初皮可克在墨西哥京城。與參議員麻羅氏Senator　Morrow締交。麻氏時爲美；功駐墨大使。蓋即林白夫人之父也。而白雷治少將則與林白大佐爲素識。林白於一九二七年。橫渡大西洋。一舉成名。時白氏方爲美國軍艦孟斐斯號之司令。林氏自巴黎返美。即爲孟斐斯兵艦之上客。寇提士初業造船。惟近以受世界經濟凋敝之影響。所業一厥不振。林宅綁案出。寇覺其中有利可圖。遂設計使皮白二人居間。而向林白作毛遂自薦焉。林氏以茲三人。俱爲社會知名之士。寇雖不甚諗。然以皮白在。亦不之疑。孰知禽獸多附於衣冠之列耶。寇提士牟利之道。不在林氏之贖欵。而在揑造新聞事實。居爲奇貨。其間報紙受愚者固衆。而參與初謀。慫恿成事者。亦不敢斷其必無。並有影片公司。以寇氏發見奇秘之事必多。事先約爲專利。寇氏虛榸事實。謂此次綁案。係海洋中酒販所爲。謂有神秘巨艦一艘。停泊於佛金尼亞附近海中。苟獲此舟。林氏之子。不難珠還合浦云。林白旣以此自駕飛機。向佛金尼亞沿海。窮搜冥探。而美；國海軍當道。竟派出兵艦七十五艘之多。助林氏之搜索。結果毫無所得。寇氏此舉。荒唐滑稽。誠無倫比矣。不意林孩屍骸發現。此事遂不可終秘。乃向警察當局自首焉。此事正在偵查之中。寇氏恐終難逃詐欺取財之罪也</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>世界著名文人團體「筆會」，刻在匃京舉行第十屆大會，會章原有不談政治之規定，顧本屆會議中討論主題，爲「筆會會員，將以何種方法，可以協助和平運動，而不涉及政治」</p>
<p>是一句什麽話？一經協助和平運動，即是涉及政治，不涉及政治，如何能協助和平運動，這原是一個矛盾律。</p>
<p>不過筆會幾會先生們，即使去涉及政治，其最大能力，也不過做幾篇文章，發幾個和平通電，發揮發揮他們的妙論，黔驢故技，不過如此。</p>
<p>故「有筆階級」决不敵「有槍階級」，事實早己告訴我們，試近舉兩例，（一）此次中日之役，許多國聨會員，討論結果之議决案，日本一手撕破，國聨亦莫可奈何，（二）日本此次政變，軍人派主組超然内閣，打破政黨内閣，一般政客，大搔其首，亦末如之何，故筆會先生，而欲不涉政治，以協助和平運動，正是寢語。</p>
<p>或曰有。</p>
<p>我國吃素老婆婆，常常口念。阿彌陀佛，保佑闔家平安，並使子孫興盛，豈不是一個和平運動而不涉政治的絶好先例。</p>
<p>又如各國耶蘇敎徒，往往遇着戰事，即大開其祈禱和平大會，豈不是又一個和平運動而不涉及政治的絶好先例。筆會先生！這種和平中正而兩不妨害的辦法，諸君何不效之。</p>

<p>下面三種小工業，亦經試驗成功，且結果極佳，所用藥品原料，價亦便宜，製造手續亦甚簡單，所成的物品，亦很有用，讀者不妨一試，旣爲有興趣的試騐，又得籍此爲公餘之暇消遣。</p>
<p>（一）玫瑰薄荷爽身粉（痱子粉）</p>
<p>滑石粉（Talc　Powder）（法國製）七英兩硼酸（Boric　Acid）一英兩半　玫瑰油（或香精）十數滴　薄荷油　七滴　（單用一種香料亦可）</p>
<p>製法　先將滑石粉與硼酸，一同置於研鉢中，研至極細，以手指摸之覺純軟光滑爲度，然後緩緩滴入香料，隨滴隨拦，倘欲精細，則拦匀後再以篩篩過，藏於香烟罐中，（須無烟氣味之罐），至暑日撲撒於皮膚上，光滑異常。</p>
<p>（二）火漆</p>
<p>白蠟（非蜜蠟）　四兩　黃臘　二兩　純松香　四兩　洋紅少許（或其他顔料）</p>
<p>製法　以三物一同置於粗料碗内·放在火上融化，而後加入色料·用力拌匀。待冷却後，即結成固體，用時須加熱至融化，倾記者在金屬模型中。</p>
<p>（三）花露水</p>
<p>純酒精（Alcohol）五十分　亞摩尼亞（Ａmmonia）三分　香精　三分</p>
<p>製法　將以上三物混合即成，功效較市上所售者好，皮膚給蟲叮後擦用此水，能止癢消毒，痱子亦能給此水消滅，倘香精用薄荷腦，則夏日用之，更覺舒服清凉。</p>

<p>上海的羅宋人所給與我的印象並不深刻，也許是我對他們不十分注意的緣故。然而即在很少的幾次接觸中，他們己經給予我相當的敎訓了。</p>
<p>很久以前的一個夏天，我在天通菴的友人家。由陽台上望下去。三五個衣衫檻褸的白俄在向我們求乞。我的友人們也就眞夠刻薄，雖然想送給他們幾個銅板，但是一定要在他們身上取得相當的報酬。</p>
<p>「喂！跳一個舞，我給你們五個銅板。」</p>
<p>於是他們拚命的跳，在汽車馳過的塵土的飛揚中流着汗。含涙的快樂，似乎掩没了流亡的悲哀。二人對跳的一塲「土風舞」跳完之後，除了五個之外還要去了我正吃着的半節香烟。</p>
<p>這是第一次。</p>
<p>在大世界附近，有一天下午我突然被一個野蠻的外國老頭兒抓住，一塊藥品在我的衣上亂拭，我不禁爲之啞然。後來他做着手勢要我他的藥，才知道這也是一種買賣，原來是退油漬的肥皂。没法，只得給他幾個銅板。但是我衣上並無油漬！</p>
<p>這是第二次。</p>
<p>前年五月，上海的好些白俄由於公共汽車罷工得着不少的好處，就是他們代替了我們中國同胞做了汽車夫。但是這却引起了人們不少的仇恨。</p>
<p>一次，我坐在一路電車上，在北四川路，開車的突然停着，破口大駡「猪玀」，於是我看見一個白俄開着公共汽車胆怯的駛過，否則說不定會吃電車夫的幾個耳光。其實這二人並無仇恨，不過因爲白俄搶去了公共汽罡夫的生意罷了。（原來中國人在這一點上到還明白！）</p>
<p>這是第三次。</p>
<p>又是一天，我同着一個懂得俄語的走在一道。</p>
<p>在電車站，一個白俄紳士領着一個孩子在等電車。不久電車在傍邊停下，洋孩子扯着他的父親向就近的拕箱裏跑去。可是當時便給父親一頓臭駡，終於轉向頭等去了。</p>
<p>由於友人的告我，才知道白色紳士所說的是··</p>
<p>「下流　伙！你要和齷齪的工人們坐到一塊兒去嗎？」</p>
<p>這是第四次。</p>
<p>啊！這便是曾經享福的白色羅宋。</p>

<p>「正陽突被赤匪攻陷，派××師××旅前往兜剿，第七隊飛機一架，由××出發，前往轟炸，××當赤匪飄着紅旗，整隊入城時，即投下炸彈六七格。」</p>
<p>没有看到這消息以前，我幾乎疑惑中國是没有飛機，没有炸彈！</p>
<p>在目前，剿匪與禦侮，同是國家的二個重要的救國綱領，剿匪固然緊要，禦侮却也不容忽視，剿匪是安内的工作，禦侮是攘外的工作，</p>
<p>「先攘外後安内，先安内後壤外」等問題，儘可不必討論，但中國有飛機炸彈，可作剿匪之用，我們看了上面的消息，便可確信無疑，</p>
<p>飛機而曰第七隊，自然還有第一二三……各隊在，而且第七隊是不是最末編成的一隊，我們無從曉得，可是中國至少有飛機七隊，却是鐵一般的事實，再有飛機而曰隊，每隊有多少飛機，我們也無從曉得，可是每隊决不止一二架，這也是誰都相信的事實，</p>
<p>唉！回憶我軍在淞滬浴血應戰，奮勇抗日的時候，我不知中國的許多飛機，躱到那裏去了，躱到那裏去了！</p>
<p>禦侮不需要飛機，剿匪却非用不可，這是說得通的嗎？</p>
<p>軍隊而可以說關山阻隔，調動不便，豈飛機也怕關山阻隔嗎？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Upright Life of Soviet Officials <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union, most people view it as a mystery, engaging in both defamation and ridicule. Both praise and adoration are often directed towards the Soviet Union. Naturally, the Soviet Union is different from any country in the current world; it is entirely new. The ideologies it upholds and its political and economic systems are still a form of experiment in this world, which we will set aside for now. Only considering the integrity, sacrifice, diligence, hard work, practicality, and striving virtues of Soviet officials, we can at least glimpse the reason why the Soviet Union can establish itself as a nation and why it is increasingly moving towards a prosperous future.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the deceased Lenin, the current leader, Stalin, is seen by most people as an extreme dictator, a demon who abuses power, oppresses everything, and indulges himself. However, the reality is not like that. Missionary Mr. Eddy, in his book "The Truth About the Soviet Union," written after six visits to the Soviet Union, mentioned that Stalin once said, "He is not a one-man dictator. He and Mussolini both consider themselves a parliament. They listen to the wishes and demands of the people. They believe they can foresee what the people need, how much they can bear, and what policies will succeed." He also said, "Stalin is a man who only talks about practice and does not indulge in empty talk." He further said, "Stalin was a poor man during his lifetime and will probably remain a poor man after his death." Isn't this truly a leader who is honest, dedicated, hardworking, and sacrificial?</p>
<p>Mr. Eddy also praised the general leaders, saying, "The leaders of the Soviet Union can share everything they have with the people. This has never happened in history. All property, profits, and income. All culture, music, and art. All entertainment and games, they share everything they have, except for power, with the people. They do not demand special rights but instead take on extremely sacrificial work." He also said, "They are not like political giants or politicians in the party who want to enjoy the greatest material rewards but instead stipulate a maximum monthly salary of 225 rubles, or 3 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen per day." They are truly a kind of fighting crusaders who want to overcome the greed in the world.</p>
<p>Not only the general leaders are like this, but also the general officials of the Soviet Union. American engineer Fuller, from Chicago, participated in the work of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan. After returning to his country, he published "Talking About the Five-Year Plan" in the Republican Magazine, saying, "The author believes that Soviet officials do not engage in corruption, extortion, and bribery. ... According to the author's experience, I have never encountered officials who, like the Soviet officials I contact daily, are completely unwilling to have family life, personal comfort, or personal health. It is the norm, not the exception, for working hours to be more than eighteen hours. I knew an official who often fainted in the office due to constant overwork. Because I knew him very well, I once advised him a little. ... He stared at me for a while and said calmly, 'If he dies, the government will build a tombstone for him, and it will have such an epitaph: Here lies Belov, who died for fulfilling his duty.'"</p>
<p>It is precisely because the leaders and officials are so hardworking and sacrificial that they can gain the trust of the majority of the people. Everyone is enthusiastic about the entire plan, dedicating their full strength to building a "New Russia."</p>
<p>"Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." Should our current officials and future officials take the above facts as standards and lessons for their political careers?</p>
<h3 id="e2">Inspecting Zhabei and Receiving Zhenru <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Inspected the area north of the railway yesterday morning</p>
<p>Meeting held yesterday to discuss the takeover of Zhenru</p>
<p>Scheduled procedure for taking over Wusong and other districts</p>
<p>The Japanese troops north of the Zhabei Railway have been scheduled to completely withdraw by 1:00 PM on the 23rd. The withdrawal area takeover committee sent personnel to inspect the Zhabei area yesterday afternoon. The scene after the inspection was extremely desolate. Because the Japanese troops are withdrawing from Zhenru tomorrow, the takeover committee specifically held a meeting yesterday to determine the handover procedures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation of Inspecting Zhabei</p>
<h3 id="e3">Departure of Inspection Personnel <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Those who departed for inspection yesterday morning included the public security group and the public utilities group. The public security group had fifteen people, including takeover committee special commissioners Cha Nanqiang and Tao Xiaojie, nine people from the public security bureau including Huang Ming, Gong Xikui, Yin Tixin, He Yihong, Wu Shaolin, Niu Jingjian, Xia Qingyu, Lin Cishan, and Bao Ju, one person from the defense corps, Wang Binyan, and three people from the fire brigade, Dong Zhihe, Chen Yousheng, and Liang Huimin. The public utilities group included takeover committee special commissioner Li Shengjun, An Zhongrui from the Public Utilities Bureau, Sun Kaizhi, Zhou Zanbang and Xue Cixin from the Public Works Bureau, Tao Fengshan from the Shanghai-Hankou Telegraph Main Line Office of the Ministry of Communications, Wu Zhongyi from the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, Shi Tifen from the Zhabei Bus Company, Liang Sicheng from the Finance Bureau, and Zhu Fuyi from the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. They gathered at the Takeover Committee on West Aisian Road and departed one after another at 8:30 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Contact with the Japanese Marine Corps <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The inspection personnel departed from the takeover committee one after another and arrived at the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps on Diswei Road in Hongkou at 8:45 AM. The two special commissioners, Cha and Tao, went to the headquarters to negotiate the inspection procedures. After fifteen minutes, the negotiation was completed. The headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps sent adjutant Lieutenant Commander Kajima to accompany them. At 9:00 AM, Kajima led the way, passing through Huanglu Road to the Tiantong'an Station, entering the Chinese territory, and first inspecting the situation there.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Tragic State of Tiantong'an Station <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>West of the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters is Tiantong'an Station. As soon as the car left the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters, within a few dozen steps, houses were destroyed and scarred by bullets, like traces of war. When they arrived at the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway, four Japanese marines stood there with guns, their arrogance particularly strong. At this time, looking west, the summer houses were all that remained of the houses. As far as the eye could see, there was not a single place that was not a broken wall or a ruin, not a single place that was not burned and bombed. Besides tiles and bricks, there was nothing left inside the houses. There were hardly any pedestrians on the streets. The scene was bleak, like a dead zone. The inspectors crossed the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway to the west and turned into Tongji Road. The houses on this road were also completely destroyed. Then they turned into Jiangwan Road, which was also collapsed, like entering an ancient castle. The water and electricity there had long been destroyed. Yesterday, during the inspection, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had already sent personnel to repair it.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Proceeding on Dongbaoxing Road <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>After the inspection of the Tiantong'an Station neighborhood, the group led by the Japanese Adjutant Kajima, entered the Public Concession through Jiangwan Road, passed through Sichuan Road and entered Zhabei through Dongbaoxing Road. At the entrance of Dongbaoxing Road, the houses were still complete, with several being residences of Japanese citizens. However, the words "Entry and Exit Permitted" were written on the door, as if they had been occupied by the Japanese army during the war. Traveling west on Dongbaoxing Road, passing through the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway, and entering Xibaoxing Road, all kinds of tragic scenes of houses in ruins and deserted streets were presented to our eyes again. Turning from Xibaoxing Road into Baoshan Road, the factory buildings of the Commercial Press and the Oriental Library and other solid buildings were destroyed like bird nests. They then went to Baotong Road and turned into Zhongxing Road. They only saw a house on the corner that was still intact, but the doors and windows had been plundered. Before long, they arrived at Hongxing Road, where the headquarters of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps was located. The convoy came to a sudden halt at 9:15 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Contacting Handover Procedures <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Upon arriving at the headquarters of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps, the Japanese Adjutant Kajima, along with our Public Security Bureau Police Detachment Captain Huang Ming, Inspector Gong Xikui, and Takeover Committee Special Commissioners Cha Nanqiang and Tao Xiaojie, entered to contact Mori Yoshihisa, the Captain of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps, to discuss the handover procedures. The other members temporarily stayed outside the battalion headquarters. The headquarters of the 1st Battalion was located at 537 Hongxing Road, a small Western-style house with the words "Wuling Shen Residence" prominently displayed at the entrance. Upon inquiring with nearby people, it was said to be the residence of the owner of a certain bookstore on Fourth Malu Road. Although the house was located in the war zone, it remained unharmed, which was truly fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e8">What was Seen Outside the Battalion Headquarters <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The houses surrounding the headquarters of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Army were almost completely destroyed. Only on the southeast corner were there six or seven new buildings, which were the latest constructions, also occupied by Japanese soldiers. At that time, reporters and others strolled around for inspection and found wooden signs in the piles of tiles, with the words "The Spiritual Tablet of the Chinese Martyrs who Died in the Spring of the 21st Year of the Republic of China, Sponsor Tanaka Nobutaka," indicating the places where our loyal and brave soldiers had died calmly during the battles between the two armies. Afterwards, Japanese civilians buried their bones. At this point, we could not help but shed tears of sympathy. These soldiers died for the sake of finding a way out for our nation and fighting for glory, and they died for our people to drive away strong enemies and resist strong invaders. Today, unfortunately, they died and could not bring back their bones, but instead had them buried by the Japanese. We felt ashamed to face these righteous men.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Announcing the Suspension of Pass Issuance <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>While paying respects to our soldiers, what caught our eye was the public announcement posted by Weng Zhaoyuan, the brigade commander of the 156th Brigade of the 78th Division of our 19th Route Army, when he resisted the Japanese in the past. Eroded by wind and rain, the handwriting was already blurred, but the words between the lines were still full of heroism. On the left was a notice from the headquarters of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps, which was issued yesterday. The original text read, "Notice from this team: Only today and tomorrow will be processed for the issuance of passes and traffic tickets, that is, from the 21st of this month, all will be suspended. Special notice, May 19, 1st Battalion Office," indicating that the Japanese army had decided to completely withdraw on the 23rd, so they made a special statement in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Inspection of Central Zhabei <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM, our Detachment Captain Huang and others completed negotiations with the Japanese side, and then went with the captain of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Navy to inspect the central area of Zhabei, while the members of the public utilities group were accompanied by an adjutant from the team. The reporters and others went with the public security group, departing west from the headquarters of the 1st Battalion, to Song Park Road, where the area was also completely destroyed. The Shibei Public School suffered particularly heavy losses, leaving only a slight trace. Passing through Yongxing Road and entering Qiujiang Road, the houses began to be completely intact, and the residents also gradually increased, but mostly were laborers, with almost no middle-class people. This shows that the situation there has not yet stabilized. At 10:45 AM, they arrived at Yuyingtang Road and got off the bus at Jiangping Yuyingtang (Infant Care Hall), and were led by the Japanese captain and others for inspection. Because the place was the garrison location of the 1st and 2nd platoons of the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Navy, the hall's houses were still quite intact. It was temporarily decided by our side to use the place as the temporary office of the 2nd Sub-district Office of the 5th District after the takeover. The headquarters of the 5th District may be located at the headquarters of the Japanese Army in Hongxing Road or rented elsewhere, which has not yet been determined. At that time, our side immediately notified the Japanese captain, reviewed the map, and discussed the route of our police station when the takeover was completed. It was decided that they would advance from Xinmin Road, Gonghe Xin Road, and Qiujiang Road, and were allowed to concentrate there before 1:00 PM on the 23rd to carry out the handover procedures with the Japanese side. After negotiations until 10:50 AM, they departed again, traveling west along Qiujiang Road, to Gonghe Xin Road, and turned north into Zhongxing Road to proceed west. At 11:55 AM, they arrived at Anhui Middle School, the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Army.</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Japanese Side is Aggressive <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>After arriving at the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion, our personnel were again led by the Japanese Adjutant Kajima and the Japanese Captain Mori Kanemoto into contact with the officer of the team. When entering, it happened that the Japanese army was practicing, arranged on both sides, as if to demonstrate. When they finally advanced and went straight up to the team captain's office upstairs, the captain of the 3rd Battalion happened to be out, and Captain Hiraji Tomio of the team's company received them. First, the captain of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Navy, Mori Kanekyu, introduced them. Then, they immediately discussed the handover procedures. Unexpectedly, the company commander's words were aggressive, saying that the Japanese army came to protect overseas Chinese. When they entered this place, there were many thieves. Fortunately, our side (the Japanese army) suppressed them with iron fist, and it gradually calmed down. Now, we are ordered to withdraw, and we should leave according to our duties. However, many Chinese people want to keep our army (the Japanese army). Therefore, we hope that the Chinese police will work hard to maintain law and order after the takeover, and especially protect the Japanese. Otherwise, the Japanese army will still have to take decisive action. When he spoke, his arrogance was excessive. Then, the company commander ordered an adjutant to accompany our inspection personnel to inspect the Tanzhiwan area in the western part of Zhabei. At 11:15 AM, when the team departed, the captain of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Navy had already said goodbye. On the side of the 3rd Battalion, two motorcycle teams were sent to protect the progress, and although the guards were tight, we felt ashamed.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Situation in Western Zhabei <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Although many houses in western Zhabei were bombed, there was no major damage. There were more people than in the central area. When the 3rd Battalion departed, they turned west into Datong Road. Some small shops along the street had opened, and there were more than a dozen fish and vegetable vendors setting up stalls to sell food along the way. Then, they turned into Hutai Road, which was full of thatched sheds on both sides. Going south on Zhongshan Road, the road was rugged and uneven, and the car was bumpy. Then, they went to the Jiaotong Road at the Beijing-Shanghai railway track, moved forward to the east, passing over the Dayang Bridge, where there were many Japanese sentries. Then, they entered Gonghe Xin Road, passed Zhongshan Road again, and arrived at Pushan Road to inspect Yangzhou Guild Hall and Pusan ​​Mountain Villa. The inspection was completed. Then, they returned to the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion via Zhonghua Road and Datong Road, and shook hands with the Japanese Adjutant Kajima and said goodbye. At 11:50 AM, they traveled west from the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Navy, traveled south on Datong Road, and passed the Sun Temple to the south of the Beijing-Shanghai Road. Then, they completely bid farewell to the Japanese-occupied area and entered a part of the Zhabei area that our side had already recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Public Utilities Inspection Report <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The public utilities inspection personnel departed from the 1st Battalion of the Navy at 10:30 AM yesterday morning, led by a Japanese adjutant, as well as Takeover Committee Special Commissioner Li Shengjun, Public Utilities Bureau Technician An Zhongrui, and others, to inspect Shanghai-Taicang Bus Company, Huashang Bus Company, and telephone companies. The report is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e14">The inspectors depart from the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Navy on Yongxing Road <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<h3 id="e15">Shanghai-Taicang Bus Company <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai station building of Shanghai-Taicang Company is still as good as before, but the internal damage is very heavy. All complete vehicles were driven away, and damaged vehicles were abandoned along the way. The machine parts on the vehicles were stolen. After the Japanese soldiers withdrew from Liuhuo, the company repaired the damaged vehicles day and night, and several vehicles have been repaired. On the one hand, it rents another ten trucks in Shanghai and installs car bodies. It is now ready and scheduled to resume business on the 24th of this month to facilitate transportation.

<p>Regarding the restoration of the Zhabei Defense Corps, according to Mr. Wang Bintong, the head of the corps, to the reporter of the Huadong News Agency, the corps has eight teams in Zhabei, with more than 600 guns and 108 people in each team, totaling more than 800 people. There are more than 200 members. During the Shanghai War, some members also participated in the service, so the corps suffered quite a bit. It is difficult to start investigating whether there were any casualties of the members, and it is not yet known for sure. After the takeover, the members will be summoned first, and they will immediately maintain law and order together with the police. The biggest loss of the corps is the uniforms, which are more than half lost. Also, regarding Zhabei firefighting, after the takeover, some firefighting equipment should be temporarily borrowed from the Nanshi area for application.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Postal Workers' Big Strike This Morning <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>A fierce postal workers' postal rescue movement</p>
<p>A nationwide strike is about to be realized</p>
<p>The last key to the survival of the post office</p>
<p>A just and solemn strike declaration</p>
<p>According to news from the postal workers, the Shanghai postal workers' postal rescue movement, which has been brewing for a long time, will start a big strike at 5:00 AM today. All work in the local postal administration and various branches will be suspended. All postal workers will not go to the bureau. The situation is very serious. It is heard that postal workers in various places will respond to the strike, which may affect the whole country. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e27">A Brief History of Labor Unions <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union was established in 1924. At that time, the postal service was still managed by foreign experts, and their goal was to reclaim postal rights. In 1926, during the nationwide general strike, they supported the Northern Expeditionary Army. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union played a significant role in eliminating remnants of the Lu clique in Zhabei. After the establishment of the National Government, postal management rights were eventually reclaimed. The union and others then organized closely, consistently striving to develop the postal service and promote the national revolution as their mission. In peacetime, they contributed greatly to the overall Chinese revolution through efforts to improve bureau affairs, the treatment of workers, and the labor movement. In 1929, when the Sino-American aviation contract was signed, the union and others pointed out various aspects that would forfeit sovereignty and humiliate the nation to the government, strongly argued their case, and eventually succeeded in canceling it. This was a remarkable achievement in the history of China's cancellation of unequal treaties. Regarding the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the union and others consistently advocated for its cancellation. Although there have been many obstacles, they have persisted with great sacrifice, upholding the spirit of continuous effort in safeguarding the postal service. This strike further demonstrates their commitment to society. After the September 18th Incident in 1931, the union and others led all employees to maintain postal services without interruption. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the union and others went to the front lines amidst gunfire to protect the wounded, assist in military transport, and donate funds. Three members of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union died heroically. There are numerous historical records of their contributions to the country and the postal service. Deeply aware of the national crisis, the union and others spared no effort. Under the leadership of the National Postal Workers' General Union and the General Labor Union, they supported postal unions in various regions and actively sought the great unity of postal workers. Their internal plans are all related to the century-long plan of the Chinese labor movement. The future progress of the Chinese labor movement depends on postal workers. The union has 3,500 members, and there are over 30,000 postal workers nationwide, all of whom are revolutionary-minded. Their future prospects are immeasurable.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Objectives of the Demands <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this demand is to implement a plan to strengthen the postal foundation. The main points can be divided into four categories: (1) Abolish the Savings and Remittance Bureau; (2) Stop subsidizing airlines; (3) Use postal revenue to exclusively support the postal service and implement special accounting; (4) Maintain the postal system. These are all fundamental measures to safeguard the postal foundation, and are the consistent demands of the union and others. Recently, in view of postal deficits and the daily weakening of the postal foundation, they urgently seek to realize these demands. Therefore, it is clear that this movement is entirely for the maintenance of the postal system, and is by no means a personal matter.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Process of Petitioning <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Savings and Remittance Bureau was established on February 15, 1929. In February of the same year, the union petitioned for the revocation of the separation order, but it was not approved. In August of the same year, they requested a merger, but this goal was not achieved. Subsequently, they repeatedly listed reasons and petitioned the central government, various ministries and departments of the National Government, and the Central Plenary Session, without interruption. Last year, when the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress opened, Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu also took office. They also proposed the principle of merging the Savings and Remittance Bureau and using postal revenue to support the postal service, requesting that it be definitively implemented. By April of this year, the Ministry of Communications, due to postal deficits, implemented postal rate increases. At the end of last month, the union and others drafted a plan to strengthen the postal foundation and petitioned the Ministry of Communications to adopt and implement it. On the 3rd of this month, they also sent representatives to present their case to the central government and the National Government in person. They then submitted two more petitions and telegrams, urging a response a total of five times. Postal unions in various regions also sent numerous telegrams and petitions, requesting consideration. It was delayed until the day before yesterday (Wednesday), when the Ministry of Communications still replied to the Postal Administration with a telegram stating "should not be allowed." It can be seen that the authorities have not given sufficient attention to the union's requests, leading to today's unfortunate event, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Declaration of Strike <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The union and others hereby solemnly declare to all sectors of society on the day of the strike, to clarify our responsibility and appeal for sympathetic support. Recently, the union and others have witnessed the postal service declining daily, which is extremely worrying. After repeated discussions, we realized that the reasons for the current decline of the postal service are not entirely due to natural disasters and man-made calamities affecting business. The most significant reason is that the entire organization of the postal service and its complete system, built over 30 years, have been fragmented and destroyed. The increase in postal rates this time is a necessary result, and also a precursor to the unsustainable future of the postal service. It cannot be solved merely by increasing some postal rates. Therefore, the union and others, cherishing the hardships of creating the postal service and unwilling to burden the public with increased costs for the convenience of postal services, investigated the root cause and gathered the opinions of 36,000 postal workers. We drafted a detailed plan to strengthen the postal foundation, including abolishing the Savings and Remittance Bureau, stopping subsidies for aviation costs, using postal revenue exclusively to support the postal service, and maintaining the postal system. The disintegration of the postal service began several years ago, and the union and others have been striving for these changes since then. Today, the postal service is in a perilous situation, and its impact on public interests can be seen in the recent increase in postal rates, which is a harbinger of the future catastrophic failure of the postal service. Therefore, the union and others, adhering to our consistent demands, believe that the proposed plan is the only good advice to save the postal service. We have petitioned the Ministry of Communications to adopt and implement it, and have also published it in newspapers to discuss it with the people of the country. In a few days, many people have gathered, believing that this is the only way to rectify the postal service. The union and others were fortunate that the Ministry of Communications would adopt this plan, consider public opinion, and sincerely accept it to lay the foundation for the postal service. However, despite the representatives of the union and others going to the capital to petition, and repeatedly urging them by telegram, it has been delayed until now without any consideration. Recently, they have even insulted us in newspapers with slanderous words, claiming that we are insincere. At this point, the public sentiment is filled with indignation and cannot be suppressed. The union and others, in this situation, are deeply saddened. On the one hand, we have received the entrustment of postal workers across the country, and on the other hand, we are pioneers for people in society. We deeply feel the weight of our mission and believe that only by implementing the final action can we urge the authorities to awaken. The union and others dare to swear to heaven and earth that this action comes from the heart of loving the postal service and loving the country, and is not comparable to seeking the interests of the workers themselves. Even if we endure hardship, if we can save a glimmer of hope for the postal service, we will not hesitate to die. People from all walks of life will surely sympathize with us and provide assistance. The future of the postal service will hopefully be brighter. This is a solemn declaration. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, May 22, 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Strike Order <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Order to the members of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union: This order is to be followed. Because the Ministry of Communications has no sincerity in accepting the plan to strengthen the postal foundation proposed by this union, we are forced to declare a strike starting at 5:00 AM on the 22nd of this month (Sunday). All members of both unions are not allowed to go to the bureau to work from the date of the strike. All must strictly abide by discipline and obey orders. Do not violate this order. This order is issued by the Presidium of the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, May 22, 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Strike Discipline <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(1) During the strike, members must absolutely obey the orders of the Presidium of the Strike Committee. (2) During the strike, members must not resume work without the resumption order from the Presidium of the Strike Committee. (3) During the strike, members must strictly maintain order and must not engage in any excessive actions. (4) During the strike, there must be no acts of sabotaging the strike. (5) During the strike, there must be no spreading of rumors or inciting people. (6) Members must not disclose important orders, slogans, or other confidential information. Violators will be considered to have sabotaged the strike. (7) During the strike, members who violate strike discipline will be subject to the most severe punishment.

<h3 id="e33">Strike Committee Announcement <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Strike Committee First Announcement: This is an announcement. This Union, seeing the postal crisis as being surrounded on all sides, for the purpose of maintaining the national enterprise and protecting the interests of the people, has in the past proposed a consolidated postal base plan to the Ministry of Communications.  However, the authorities have ignored it and delayed it until now, without any clear indication of sincere acceptance.  This Union cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the demise of the postal enterprise, and is forced to endure hardship and pain, and urgently rescue ourselves.  From this day on, we announce a strike in the hope of prompting the authorities to reflect.  Although mail delivery will be suspended and the pain will ultimately be temporary, a permanent postal base will be a long-term blessing beyond measure.  We hope that people from all walks of life, friendly gentlemen, will appreciate this sincerity and give their sympathy and assistance.  The postal service will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.  This Union respectfully leads all workers in heartfelt prayers and wishes.  We offer this with sincerity and hope for your understanding. This announcement is made by the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, May 21, 1932.</p>

<p>The organization of the strike committee is quite strict. Special inspectors have been dispatched to maintain local order, ensuring that it does not affect public security.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Thorough Investigation of Bribery <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the Ministry of Communications, based on a confidential report, stated that someone had spent 30,000 yuan to instigate the Shanghai postal workers' strike. The union and others immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Communications yesterday to thoroughly investigate the source of the confidential report, so that legal action could be taken. Recently, the union and others have been filled with indignation. If the Ministry of Communications does not make a clear statement on this matter, they will file a public lawsuit in accordance with the law to protect their legal rights. At the same time, the Nanjing Postal Workers' Union also discovered an anonymous advertisement published in the Beijing newspaper, falsely accusing the postal workers. They have filed a serious protest and requested the National Postal Workers' General Union to thoroughly investigate it.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Responses from Various Regions <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>

There is a great momentum. If the Ministry of Communications does not fully accept the plan, a nationwide general strike may eventually become a reality.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu to Meet Again with Postal Workers and Central Government Representatives This Afternoon</p>
<p>A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao newspaper visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about the authorities' definitive measures for handling the postal affairs. Mayor Wu graciously received the reporter and stated that regarding the postal strike issue, he had summoned representatives from the Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union for several days, and had urged them with the utmost sincerity that during this time of national crisis, the actions of postal workers should be taken with caution and should not be taken to the extreme. Yesterday afternoon, he met again with representatives from both unions, as well as the Director of the Shanghai Postal Bureau, the Postal Commissioner, and the Director of the General Bureau, at the Municipal Government to discuss the matter. Regarding the workers' demands, particularly the issue of their compensation, the Ministry of Communications had already shown considerable accommodation. Other issues, such as the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau and the cancellation of aviation subsidies, involve the national administrative system and national laws, and cannot be easily changed. Moreover, these are issues that the workers should not interfere with. Even if they have opinions to present, they should do so in the form of suggestions, and should not use strikes as a means of coercion. The central government has already sent personnel to Shanghai to take charge. He sincerely hoped that the workers would understand their responsibilities to society and the nation, and that they would prioritize the overall situation, engage in long-term discussions, and refrain from acting rashly. He also arranged for the representatives to meet again with the central government representatives at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today.</p>

<p>Japanese Think His Life is at Risk</p>
<p>Shigemitsu's Condition Also Worsens</p>
<p>Murai May Leave Hospital Today</p>
<p>Regarding the condition of Japanese military commander Shirakawa, the Japanese military hospital stated yesterday that he had shown some improvement. However, most Japanese believe that Shirakawa, who is over sixty years old, may be in danger of losing his life if he cannot get out of danger within the next day or two. Shirakawa suffered multiple shrapnel wounds all over his body. However, the wounds themselves are no longer the problem. The sudden turn for the worse is due to internal complications. Shirakawa had pre-existing chronic illnesses. Now, due to the new wounds, the old illnesses have recurred, leading to a critical condition. According to a report from Fukumin Hospital yesterday, Minister Shigemitsu's condition was improving well. However, according to visitors who went to see him, Shigemitsu's condition is also quite concerning. Shigemitsu is in a state of extreme weakness and sweats profusely at night, apparently due to the weather. Consul General Murai's condition has improved and he may leave the hospital this afternoon.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Rengo News Agency in Kobe on the 21st stated that Miki Yoshihide, a first-class military surgeon specially dispatched by the Ministry of the Army, boarded the Shanghai Maru at 11:00 this morning to go to Shanghai.</p>

From 11:00 PM onwards, he remained stable and slept peacefully last night. This morning, he felt tired and had slight discomfort in the upper abdomen.

<h3 id="e41">The Incident on Wuzhen Road Bridge <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Consular Body</p>
<p>Strongly Criticizing the Japanese Military's Inappropriate Use of Force</p>
<p>The Consular Body in Shanghai held a meeting regarding the Japanese military's violent incident on Wuzhen Road on May 3rd. This newspaper has obtained from foreign sources the original letter from the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Bell, to the Leading Consul of the Consular Body, Mr. Canningham, on May 9th. It has not yet been published to the outside world, and is translated as follows: To Your Excellency, the Leading Consul, I am writing to you to forward a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police regarding the behavior of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces on Xian Wuzhen Road in the Settlement on the night of May 3rd, 1932, for the reference of the Consular Body. I will not pursue the various improprieties of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in the Settlement in the past. I believe that the repeated unreasonable interference and obstruction of the Municipal Council's administration by the Japanese Navy still makes it difficult for the Municipal Council to handle matters, and I must ask the Consular Body to take note. In the Municipal Council's opinion, the Japanese military commander has been acting inappropriately since the outbreak of the war. The Japanese military commander has consistently abused his force. The Municipal Council considers this policy to be unnecessary. For minor incidents, the Japanese military often exaggerates them to satisfy their desire to kill innocent Chinese. They even assault neutral foreigners with violence. It is inconceivable that responsible military officers trained by a modern first-class power would cause the Wuzhen Road incident. In the Wuzhen Road incident, the Japanese military, merely because of a few low-class Chinese throwing stones and shouting, actually invaded the Settlement and indiscriminately used bayonets, stabbing innocent Chinese passersby. Not to mention their threatening behavior towards the Municipal Council Police and the allied forces maintaining order in the Settlement, which is provocative. Since the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement now seems unlikely to completely remove the Japanese Navy from the Settlement, I hope that the Consular Body will do its best to strictly prohibit the Japanese military from interfering with the Municipal Council's administration.</p>

<p>Most Team Members Took a Special Train to Shenyang Yesterday Morning from Harbin</p>
<p>(Moscow) The League of Nations Investigative Team currently staying in Harbin consulted with the local Soviet Consul, requesting the Soviet government to allow them to pass through Sakhalin and cross Hailanpao to meet with General Ma Zhanshan. The Soviet government, adhering to its policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of Manchuria, has instructed the Consul in Harbin to express its disapproval. (TASS dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government, on the pretext of adhering to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the three northeastern provinces, does not allow the Lytton Investigative Team currently in Harbin to pass through Russia to Sakhalin to meet with Ma Zhanshan. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th) (Moscow) It was announced here tonight that Lord Lytton of the League of Nations Liaoning Case Investigative Team had requested a Soviet Russian visa, allowing team members to take the Chinese Eastern Railway to Chita and Hailanpao via Siberia, and then cross the river to Heihe in Manchuria. The Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, adhering to the Russian government's declared policy of not interfering with the investigation, replied by telegram refusing the request. This action by the Soviet Union has made it impossible for the Investigative Team to take the Russian route to Heihe to meet with General Ma Zhanshan. According to a dispatch from Harbin, the Investigative Team is scheduled to depart from Harbin for Shenyang on the 22nd. (Dispatch from Guomin News Agency on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The work that the Lytton Investigative Team was supposed to do in Harbin has been completed. Most of the members took a special train to Shenyang this morning. Several more attendants plan to leave Harbin on Monday night. Several other members are scheduled to take a plane to Qiqihar on Sunday morning to investigate the situation there. After arriving in Shenyang, the Investigative Team will stay for five days before going to Dalian. (Dispatch from Guomin News Agency on the 21st) (Harbin) The Lytton Investigative Team may leave Harbin today. If possible, several team members will go to Qiqihar, and the rest will return to Changchun. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Changchun) Xie Jieshi protested to the Lytton Investigative Team regarding Dr. Wellington Koo's political activities in Manchuria. Lord Lytton replied to Xie last night by telegram, expressing deep regret for the misunderstanding and stating that he was drafting a public declaration to clarify the relationship between the Investigative Team and Dr. Koo. Xie Jieshi pointed out that the increasing activities of the rebels in northern Manchuria were caused by the Investigative Team's desire to meet Ma Zhanshan and its arrival in Harbin. Subsequently, the Investigative Team published an article explaining the reasons for wanting to meet Ma Zhanshan. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Investigative Team has sent an article to the authorities of "Manchukuo" explaining the desire to meet with General Ma Zhanshan, stating briefly that the Investigative Team's desire to meet with General Ma Zhanshan originated from newspaper reports and other commentaries. It is now appropriate to clarify that their desire and actions, the situation in Manchuria, the two sides in the dispute, have different views, so it is currently impossible to accept the opinions of either side, and it is necessary to collect a wide range of information. Since the officials of Manchukuo have already been met, it is hoped that General Ma Zhanshan will be given the opportunity to provide information. A state of war currently exists in northern Manchuria, and the conditions under which the Investigative Team is appointed do not allow it to interfere in military affairs. Therefore, the Investigative Team informed the attendants and Mr. Ohashi, the representative of the Manchukuo authorities accompanying the team, of its desire to meet with General Ma Zhanshan. The end of the article stated that the Investigative Team was aware that there would be various practical difficulties in traveling to meet with General Ma Zhanshan, but it never expected that the will of the Investigative Team would be misunderstood.

<p>County Magistrate and Regiment Commander abandon the city and flee with weapons.</p>
<p>Inmates break out of prison and collude with Red bandits to seize the city.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Daily News published a telegram from the Yingshang Public Delegation on the 19th, which reads: "Song Shike, commander of the independent 40th Brigade stationed in Huoqiu, went to Nanjing. The deputy commander Yan Wu and the regimental commanders Cheng Lie and Wang Shaojiu, upon hearing that bandits occupied Zhengyang on the 12th of this month, withdrew all troops stationed in Yulin Shop, a town under the jurisdiction of the county, to the city at 1 p.m. on the 13th. At 9 p.m. that night, Deputy Commander Yan convened a local meeting, claiming to aid Zhengyang and extorted over 3,000 yuan. Soldiers were also allowed to loot 13,000 catties of relief wheat and 1,400 bags of relief wheat from the Relief Association. Over a hundred stores and residents in the city were robbed, and over fifty young women and girls were kidnapped. At 8 a.m. on the 14th, they forcibly conscripted over 3,000 people and retreated towards Yingshang. At that time, the legal organizations in the city knelt and begged County Magistrate Cha Shihhan and Regiment Commander Sun Peiji to unite the local militia and defend the city while waiting for reinforcements. After twelve hours, the county magistrate and regiment commander locked the east, west, and south gates and fled through the north gate towards Wangji, taking all 700-plus rifles and two mortars belonging to the local militia, causing a complete loss of protection and great disorder. The prison was broken open, all criminals escaped, and the county government archives were reduced to ashes. All the legal organizations and the people of the city, seeing that the troops from Yulin Shop had retreated but there were no bandits, and there were also rumors that the Red bandits from Zhengyang were on the move, gathered the militia and waited for reinforcements. At 5 p.m. on the 15th, the escaped inmates, knowing the city was weak, colluded with over 300 Red Guards from the south of the county to seize the county seat. The people, supporting the old and leading the young, cried out, numbering no less than tens of thousands. The bandits are now entrenched in the city. We urgently request that strong troops be dispatched day and night to suppress them and recover the county seat. The responsible officials who abandoned the city should be severely punished to maintain military discipline. This is the weeping plea of the county party headquarters, chamber of commerce, legal organizations, and 300,000-plus surviving residents of Huoqiu. The postal and telegraph communications of Zhengyang have been disrupted since the county seat fell, so the report has been delayed. Representatives have been sent via Yingshang to report by telegram." (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today's Central Daily News editorial "The Huoqiu Catastrophe" stated that the Huoqiu garrison troops withdrew due to bandit alarms, entered the city to extort large sums of money, followed by looting. How are their actions different from those of bandits? The county magistrate and regiment commander abandoned the city and left first. How are they different from bandits? If military officials are like this and civil officials are like that, who can plead for the people in the heartland who are suffering from both bandits and officials today? (Telegraph, 21st)</p>

Otherwise, it will inevitably be like our country's parliament in the past, which was either controlled by others or floated without roots.

<p>Preparing for Large-Scale Naval Gunfire Exercise</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th - News was released today that the American Atlantic Fleet, currently in the Pacific, will remain in the Pacific until October 1st. According to Navy Commander Veazie, the Navy made this decision in order to save money and utilize the fleet's current position for a large-scale naval gunfire exercise. However, the State Department recently suggested to the Navy that the United States should keep a "reconnaissance fleet" in the Pacific, presumably due to the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 20th - U.S. Navy Commander Ballard stated today that the American Atlantic Patrol Fleet will remain stationed in the Pacific until October 1st and then return. It was previously expected that the Patrol Fleet would return to the Atlantic as soon as the exercises were completed. This announcement by the Navy Commander is likely related to the situation in the Far East. In addition, the Navy Department also announced today the reassignment of Rear Admiral Leff as Commander of the U.S. Navy. The current Commander, Schofield, will return to the Navy Bureau for service, and the current Commander of the Battle Fleet, McNami, will be transferred back to the Navy Bureau to replace Leff.

<p>Audience with the Emperor is Again Postponed</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st - Far East News Agency: Regarding the formation of the Japanese cabinet, since Elder Saiyuanji arrived in Tokyo from Okitsu, two days have passed. The military and the advocated political parties have not only failed to reach a consensus, but the confrontation is intensifying. Elder Saiyuanji has been meeting with elder statesmen and senior officials for days, listening to their opinions. He feels that the military's tough stance and the current public sentiment cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, the selection of a candidate for prime minister remains hesitant. ▲ Tokyo, 21st - Reuters: Elder Saiyuanji, who has always participated in national affairs, seems unsure of his ability to choose a prime minister. The seriousness of the current political situation is evident from this. Saiyuanji will consult with Admiral Togo tomorrow morning regarding the political situation (Togo is known for not interfering in politics), who defeated the Russian navy in the Russo-Japanese War, and Admiral Osumi, and then enter the palace on Sunday afternoon or Monday morning to report to the Emperor his opinions on organizing a new cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st - Electric Communication: Council President Kuratomi and Interior Minister Makino, when meeting with Duke Saiyuanji yesterday, strongly argued that in this extraordinary time, a national unity cabinet must be formed. They also requested that a choice be made from among Hirao Chikiro, Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, and Saito Minoru to be recommended as the next prime minister. However, Yamamoto is old and unable to handle the heavy workload, and Saito is sickly and unable to take on important responsibilities. Only Hirao is quite popular with the military, but it is doubtful whether he can win over cabinet members. In short, each has strengths and weaknesses, and it is still difficult to consider them suitable. Duke Saiyuanji is also concerned about the relationship with political parties, so he has not yet decided. However, after Duke Saiyuanji arrived in Tokyo, the political atmosphere, which advocated the constitutional norm of establishing a Suzuki cabinet, has been overshadowed by the atmosphere advocated by the military for establishing a national unity cabinet. For the sake of caution, Duke Saiyuanji met with Count Yamamoto at 9:00 a.m. today, Baron Wakatsuki at 10:00 a.m., and Count Kiyoura at 2:00 p.m. The military met with Marshal Togo and Marshal Uehara to fully listen to all parties' opinions and properly handle this important situation. Therefore, the date of entering the palace has been postponed by another day and will be on the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Senior Officials' Opinions Tend to Converge <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Inclining Towards a National Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st - China United News Agency: The opinions of Japanese senior officials on the current situation are diverse, and Saiyuanji is also hesitant. It is heard that opinions among Japanese senior officials are divided into four types: (1) Baron Hiranuma has a special relationship with the military, but will clash head-on with political parties, and stability in the current situation will still be difficult to achieve; (2) Recommend Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe as the next prime minister, gather the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties and top-notch politicians to form a first-class cabinet; (3) The biggest difficulty at present is the financial crisis. To save this difficult situation, Takahashi Korekiyo is the most suitable candidate for the next president, but Takahashi must leave his party membership; (4) To stop the military's overreaching behavior, recommend former Korean Governor-General Saito as the next prime minister. The above opinions of the senior officials are all unanimously opposed to a cabinet formed by political parties.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st Evening - Far East News Agency: Duke Saiyuanji today extended his meeting to Minseito President Wakatsuki, Count Kiyoura, and Yamauchi, representing naval elder statesman Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe. Apart from Minseito President Wakatsuki still expressing his support for party politics, Kiyoura and Yamamoto Gonnohyoe's representative both stated that the country is facing an unprecedented crisis and that a strong national unity cabinet must be formed to shoulder this important responsibility. They believe that forming a cabinet solely by an established political party is not in line with the current national conditions. Furthermore, Saiyuanji believes that the opinions of veteran officials should not be overlooked in this critical moment related to national conditions. Today, he specially telegraphed naval elder statesman Uehara, who was recuperating in the countryside, to come to Tokyo. General Uehara arrived at Saiyuanji's residence in Surugadai by car at 4:00 p.m. and presented his views on resolving the current political crisis to Saiyuanji, which were largely the same as those of Count Kiyoura and Yamamoto Gonnohyoe. Therefore, Saiyuanji's recommendation to form a cabinet seems to be leaning towards adopting the military's opinion and forming a unity cabinet. However, tonight at 8:00 p.m., he plans to summon Army Minister Araki to his residence again to fully understand the detailed opinions of the entire army, and then meet with Admiral Togo and Naval Minister Osumi tomorrow to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st - Electric Communication: Today, before visiting Duke Saiyuanji at the invitation of Duke Saiyuanji, former Minister of Railways Yamauchi Ichiji spoke to people about the content of the meeting, saying, "I went at the invitation of Duke Saiyuanji and presented matters concerning Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe's important affairs. What those important affairs are, I cannot say clearly. Whether Duke Saiyuanji and Count Yamamoto will meet is unknown. However, Count Yamamoto is very healthy. However, whether he will come forward to save the current situation, I also do not know." It is said that the reason why Duke Saiyuanji summoned Yamauchi was because Count Yamamoto's position is higher than other senior officials, so he first summoned his close relative Yamauchi to inquire about the Count's recent situation, or Duke Saiyuanji has the intention of employing Count Yamamoto.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st - China United News Agency: After Saiyuanji arrived in Tokyo, he listened to the opinions of elder statesmen, senior officials, and the military, all of which were against a party cabinet and advocated a national unity cabinet. However, although Hiranuma Kiichiro has a close relationship with the military, his criticism of the financial community is unfavorable, and it is difficult to gather first-class politicians, and he will inevitably clash head-on with political parties. Therefore, Saiyuanji's intention is to entrust Count Yamamoto to take office and organize the cabinet, thereby alleviating the head-on conflict between the military clique and the financial clique.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st - Electric Communication: At 9:00 a.m. today, Commander of the Military Police Qin and Vice Minister of the Army Koiso visited Army Minister Araki. Because of the opposition to the military's interference in politics regarding the issue of the next cabinet, it was discussed and believed that the military or the army has not engaged in political movements, but each is expressing opinions informally from their respective standpoints. In the extraordinary</p>

<p>time of the country, it is the duty of a citizen to express their private opinions. Moreover, there is no such law that active-duty soldiers cannot sit idly by and watch the country perish. The Army Minister is a state minister. The above opinions have been agreed upon, so the military still maintains a tough attitude.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st - Electric Communication: The Army Military Council held a meeting at the Army Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon, resolving that if a party cabinet continues to appear, unfortunate incidents will be difficult to eliminate. Although there is criticism that the military should not interfere in politics, it cannot be considered. It is necessary to strive to realize a national unity cabinet.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st - Japan News Agency: Yesterday, the Seiyukai executives believed that the political situation cannot be stabilized unless the president of our party, which occupies an absolute majority, organizes it. If the military's movement has any actions that undermine constitutional politics, then we will rise up to uphold the constitution. On the other hand, the Seiyukai's young faction also held a Diet members' meeting on the 21st to discuss the issue of upholding the constitution, intending to contact the Minseito party and start a major constitutional movement.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Eight Years of Fraud, Towering Debts <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th - Reuters: The final report of the expert committee investigating the status of the late Match King Kreuger's companies points out that Kreuger was the world's largest bankrupt, with Kreuger's personal debts reaching 500 million kronor, plus indirect debts of 400 million kronor. For unsecured creditors, the amount of debt that can be recovered is very small, and all of Kreuger's companies must file for bankruptcy. According to the expert committee's opinion, large-scale fraud has been going on for almost eight years, or more than eight years. Kreuger &amp; Toll Co. was owed 200 million kronor by Kreuger, but the assets that Kreuger could offset were mostly securities, and these securities had already been mortgaged to others when Kreuger was speculating.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th - National News Agency: The global economic downturn, the lack of remedies, and the public's dissatisfaction with party rule have resulted in the growing expansion of National Socialist movements throughout Europe. In addition to Germany, the National Socialist Party is expected to gain power in the four countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula in the coming weeks, especially in Denmark and Sweden. In Sweden, public opinion has been greatly shaken since the discovery of Match King Kreuger's fraud. In other parts of Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, the momentum of its National Socialist Party is no less than that of Germany. However, there are two National Socialist parties in the country, both of which have extremely prosperous party members. One is a purely Czech party, and the other is closely integrated with the German National Socialist Party. In the German-speaking border areas, it is even more encouraged. Recently, countries such as Romania and Poland have joined the National Socialist movement. The Romanian party was established in the Romanian capital this week, and the Polish party was organized by defectors from the National Labor Party and was established just today.</p>

<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>America is Dominated by Traditional Vanity</p>
<p>American Actions are Overt Aggression</p>
<p>American Military Strength is Weak and Dares Not Provoke Japan</p>
<p>Regarding the Manchurian issue, which has been pending for many years, our country has already "taken the last iron ladder." At that time, the intentions of Britain and Russia were that the United States would make some indication, but in reality, the United States has not suffered any substantial losses in today's Manchuria. Trade with Manchuria is also the same as before, with no increase or decrease. Apart from trade, there are no other investment enterprises. Therefore, in terms of protecting its own interests, it cannot tolerate Japan's actions in Manchuria. However, it is simply agitated by false emotions about international interests and expresses dissatisfaction. In other words, it cannot help but evoke a sense of sympathy for Russia's vast battlefield where it commemorates a tragic defeat.</p>
<p>Since the Harriman incident in 1905, after the Russo-Japanese War in Manchuria, the United States looked back on the struggle between Japan and the United States for hegemony. It already had a very deep "unpleasant memory" of Manchuria, because its plan failed and it could not establish economic superiority in Manchuria. We read Brandt's book "China, Japan, and Korea Ten Years Later," which is very clear about the situation in the Far East. He hates that Japan has special rights in Manchuria and will bet the entire strength of its nation to eliminate interferers. His hidden resentment can be seen. In short, in the past relationship between Japan and the United States in Manchuria, the United States has never been afraid of Japan. Now that Japan has taken the final hammer again, the United States must feel even more uneasy in its heart.</p>
<p>We discuss the Manchurian issue and investigate the dangerous nature of the American attitude, which is actually dominated by the traditional vanity of the American people. Since Secretary of State Hay announced the Open Door Policy, the United States has repeatedly used containment policies to protect its own rights and interests, hindering the political and economic advancement of various countries in China. Therefore, some people criticize the American people as "unintentionally benevolent." However, regardless of whether it is unintentional or intentional, in modern history, the actions of the United States represent overt aggression, which is undeniable. Furthermore, from the perspective of the general American people, their restriction of the freedom of the Philippines is originally intended to protect small countries from aggressors in the north, that is, their forced annexation of America is intended to achieve lasting peace for North and South America.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Chen Jitang Abandons Bandit Suppression Operations <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>All Units Entering Fujian and Jiangxi Withdrawn to Guangdong</p>
<p>It is Reported that the Guangxi Army is Gathering in Wuzhou and Will Soon Move Eastward</p>
<p>Chen Ce and Chen Jitang Compete for Military Equipment</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Xiao Focheng, etc., sent three telegrams to the Nanjing authorities a few days ago, questioning the signing of the truce agreement, but have not yet received a reply. At the same time, Xiao, etc., issued a deleted telegram due to the critical situation in Yuguan, stating that Zhang Xueliang's telegram to the central government reported that the Japanese were plotting to occupy Shanhaiguan, requesting instructions. The central government telegraphed back, instructing him to resist according to the situation. The comrades are already unable to fathom the meaning of resisting according to the situation, and Zhang Xueliang is acting on his consistent policy of non-resistance, abandoning Jiukou and Shimenzhai to enable the Japanese to seize the key to Pingjin. What is his intention? It is really incomprehensible. As expected, the enemy has transferred the headquarters of the 14th Division to Qinhuangdao in the past few days to attack Shanhaiguan. Zhang Xueliang again did not resist, losing the key point. What is the central government's policy? We look forward to a telegram reply, etc. It is not known how the central government will reply.</p>
<p>The Guangdong province is actively preparing for military affairs. The representatives of Guangxi and Guizhou provinces stationed in Guangdong also claim on the surface that Guangxi is willing to send a division of four regiments to Guangdong to cooperate in suppressing bandits in Fujian, and Guizhou plans to transfer troops of one division or more to participate in suppressing the communists, but they all demand military expenses from Guangdong. It is still questionable whether Guangdong can approve the grant. In view of this situation, Chen Jitang has adopted a conservative attitude. The troops that had entered Fujian and Jiangxi a few days ago have been gradually withdrawn. On the 12th of this month, the 7th Division of the 3rd Army, Huang Yanzhen's troops, on the Fujian border had retreated to Dapu, the 8th Division, Huang Zhiwen's troops, had retreated to Pingyuan, the 1st Independent Division, Huang Renhuan's troops, had retreated to Jiaoling, and the 2nd Independent Division, Zhang Ruigui's troops, had returned to Chaozhou and Shantou. Defense facilities were set up at the coastal ports of Shantou to prevent enemy舰 from attacking. After Liu Zhiyan, the captain of the 5th Aircraft Squadron stationed in Shantou, left his post, the aircraft was taken over by Xie Mang, and anti-aircraft guns were erected at various fortresses, with deployments that are considered strict. Li Yangjing, the commander of the 3rd Army, arrived in the province on the evening of the 14th at Chen Jitang's telegram call to discuss military plans. The 1st Army, Yu Hanmou's troops, which had entered Jiangxi, also moved back to Guangdong, taking into account the news from Northwest and West River. According to reports, on the 12th, Chen Boying's troops, the 1st Regiment of the 1st Independent Brigade stationed in Nankang, and Liao Daoming's troops, the 2nd Regiment, had returned to Renhua Changjiangwei to join the local defense army, the 2nd Independent Brigade, Chen Zhang's troops, and the police brigade, Chen Hanguang's troops, and left Renhua to pursue the bandits and communists on the Hunan border. On the West River, it was recently reported that the Guangxi army had prepared to transfer some units of the 7th Army and the 15th Army eastward to assist in suppressing bandits. The Liao troops of the 7th Army had concentrated in Quanzhou, Fuhe, and other places. The Su Xin militia had also arrived in Wuzhou. On the 11th, a large number of civilian ships were hired in Wuzhou for use. Chen Jitang paid close attention to Guangxi's actions. As for Chen Ce's naval force, it is still entrenched in Hainan. The ships that went to sea, such as Zhongshan, Hairui, Fuan, Jianggong, Jiangda, and Jianggu, have all concentrated in Qiong. It is said that there are still inland river ships that have fled to sea to join Chen Ce. A few days ago, Chen Jitang ordered a large batch of military equipment from Hong Kong, which was transported back to Guangzhou by the salt transport department's anti-smuggling ship. On the way to the Dachan Customs sea area, it was intercepted and seized by the Zhongshan warship. It is estimated that there are more than 4,000 rifles. It is said that the reason why Chen Ce did this was because Chen Ce had 600 Mauser pistols worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan stored on the Guangjin warship, which were all confiscated by Chen Jitang. Now, he specially intercepted the rifles purchased by Chen Jitang as retaliation. Chen Ce and Chen Jitang are already in a state of irreconcilable opposition, and Chen Jitang's military operations have also been greatly constrained by losing the naval arm. (May 16)</p>

<p>Shou County Refugees Organize an Appeal Association</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: With the loss of Zhengyang this time, the people upstream of the Huai River are all feeling terrified. When the bandits attacked the town, the people fled to Bengbu, crowding under the river, but most of them were alone. For several days, they have been sleeping in the wind and dew, which is very pitiful. Yu Yumen and Zhu Zhonghua, merchants from Zhengsheng in Bengbu, specially requested Qian Xiaosheng, the manager of the Bank Public Warehouse, to temporarily use Warehouse No. 11 as a refugee shelter. Qian readily agreed and also provided firewood and rice, allowing the refugees to cook for themselves to make a living and wait for peace to return home. When the Red bandits withdrew from Zhengyang, Huoqiu was reported to have fallen again. Ying and Feng counties only have police teams and militias to defend, and no troops are going to support them. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. The people of those counties fled to Bengbu again. Over the past few days, more than 10,000 people have arrived. Peng Zhuruo and Xu Baizheng, gentry and merchants from Shouzhen in Bengbu, organized the Shou County Refugees Appeal Association as a group to request aid and disaster relief. The Anhui North Flood Relief Association also believes that the refugees are waiting for relief and has launched a refugee relief association. It recently sent a telegram to Xu Shiying and Zhu Qinglan in Shanghai, stating that Huoqiu has fallen, and Shoufeng and Ying counties are in danger. Refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, have fled to Bengbu, more than 10,000 people. They are waiting to be fed and are in a pitiful and unbearable sight. Our association plans to set up a refugee relief association, but there is no money in the mainland. Please allocate money for relief to save the survivors, etc. After the establishment of the Shou County Refugees Appeal Association, it specially dispatched representatives Yu Yumen, Sun Qiqian, and Che Wu, etc., to go to Beijing on the night of the 18th to appeal and urge Xu Tingyao, the commander of the 4th Division, to lead his troops to rush to support day and night. It is now learned that Xu Tingyao arrived in Bengbu from Beijing at 7:00 a.m. on the 19th, and his troops, the 10th, 11th, and 12th Brigades, and directly subordinate units have also arrived. According to the division's chief of staff, Sheng, the troops have completely arrived here and are waiting for orders to depart. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Urgency of Wuxi's Relief for the Silk Industry <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that the silk of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is a major part of foreign trade. In recent years, due to farmers adhering to the status quo and silk merchants and reelers failing to improve, production has lagged behind. At the same time, it has also been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, causing silk factories to fail year after year. In order to actively improve, it has repeatedly ordered the directors of the industrial departments of the two provinces to negotiate relief measures in Shanghai. Director He of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry believes that the silk industry in Jiangsu is centered on Wuxi. He specially came to Wuxi to invite various industries related to banking, money, silk, and silkworms to discuss seriously. However, due to the lack of cash, all parties felt difficult. However, the spring cocoons will be on the market in an instant. If measures are not taken early, tens of millions of natural products will inevitably be completely destroyed. It was decided to dry them on behalf of others, calculating the dry cocoon production in the province at 70,000 loads, which requires about 540,000 yuan for drying. The government subsidizes half of it, and the other half is raised by the cocoon-producing counties themselves. The "Wuxi Silk Area Relief Committee" has been established, and local groups and various industries related to banking, money, silk, and silkworms are working together to send a telegram to the provincial government and the Department of Industry, asking for subsidies. Because the provincial treasury is empty, it cannot be subsidized. It was decided to temporarily allow the allocation of debt vouchers, which must be returned within a time limit. The Silk Area Relief Committee was immediately replied to by telegram. After receiving the telegram, the relief committee believed that if the provincial government had no cash subsidies, then all measures could not proceed. Yesterday, it sent another telegram to the Department of Industry, stating that "drying on behalf of others is originally to protect natural products and relieve agricultural famine. If we talk about local commerce, it happens to be after the Shanghai war and the failure of the silk industry last year. The end of May is approaching, all industries are bleak, and the cocoon market is depressed. There is a lack of cash in the mainland. Banking, money, silk, and cocoons all feel difficult. Whether or not drying on behalf of others can be done depends entirely on whether there are funds from the province. We sincerely ask the provincial government to try its best to find a way to allocate cash subsidies. Wuxi plans to purchase 80,000 loads of cocoons this year, and the drying cost per load is 2.67 yuan. A subsidy of half requires about 100,000 yuan, so the financial aspects can gradually collect and borrow half of it to help make things happen," etc. The directors of various banks in Jiangyin jointly entered the province on the 19th to ask the provincial government to consider the plight of farmers and the pity of natural products being destroyed. The cash subsidy must also assist in debt vouchers of 500,000 yuan at the minimum, which is difficult to return within a time limit. The silk factory colleagues also convened a general meeting yesterday. According to the principle that Director He showed "strictly prohibiting speculative improvement work", they seriously discussed and decided that factories that can meet this principle must register with the association before June 15th. All the expenses during the drying period will also be shared equally according to the number of vehicles.</p>

According to their confession, they were staying at the Jiangsu Grand Hotel in Shuilu Lane in the city. Subsequently, an officer led armed police to the address and apprehended four men, Huang Min, Ma Deyao, Tang Rongjin, and Huang Han, in room 28. They also found a six-inch pistol and five bullets. The men were escorted back to the station and a report was prepared to be sent to the branch bureau and then forwarded to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

Therefore, they went to the county to file a lawsuit. The county government sent officials to Juegang to inspect the body a few days ago. Dozens of wounds were found on the corpse, especially on the back. After the inspection, the family was ordered to collect the body and sign a statement. The family, believing that the facts were not clear, refused to collect the body and knelt in the streets with disheveled hair and incense, shouting for justice and asking all sectors to uphold justice. Seeing this, all the shops immediately went on strike in support, vowing not to reopen until the murderer was arrested and severely punished.</p>

<p>Three-Year Education Plan (II)</p>
<p>7.  Improve Vocational Education</p>
<p>To improve vocational education, the following items should be implemented during this period:</p>
<p>(A) Enrich equipment, add practice fields, and establish connections with various industrial organizations to supplement the inadequacy of school equipment.</p>
<p>(B) Strictly enroll students. Vocational talents should be carefully selected, preferring quality over quantity, to eliminate the chronic problem of class sizes being filled superficially.</p>
<p>(C) Prepare to restore the Provincial Suzhou Industrial School. The original school buildings and machinery of the Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Specialized School have been abandoned and unused. Therefore, within the feasible scope of funding during this period, preparations should be made to restore the Suzhou Industrial School, temporarily offering high school civil engineering and dyeing and weaving departments. Graduates of junior high schools with excellent grades and a desire to dedicate themselves to the industrial sector should be selected to study for three years. In collaboration with the Department of Industry, a special weaving and finishing workshop should be established in the dyeing and weaving department, organized and managed according to industrial economic principles. Students of the dyeing and weaving department must be managed by the workshop when they enter the workshop for practice and are no different from the workers in the workshop.</p>
<p>8.  Organize General Middle Schools. The organization of general middle schools is divided into the following items:</p>
<p>(A) Restrict county-run high schools. The funding and equipment for high schools are beyond the economic capacity of a single county at present. Therefore, for each county that has already established a high school, its actual funding amount and equipment status should be strictly examined. Those with confirmed funding and adequate equipment should be approved or denied for continued operation separately.</p>
<p>(B) Enforce the full-time system for middle school teachers. In Jiangsu Province, most middle school teachers are actually based on a time-based system, where their responsibility ends after completing their teaching. In the future, the full-time system should be enforced to achieve a consistent understanding between teachers and students and the effect of personality influence, which can also help rectify the academic atmosphere and discipline.</p>
<p>(C) Implement the trial examination and investigation system for all levels of middle school. To improve the academic ability of middle school students and eliminate the malpractice of teachers and students being perfunctory, the trial examination and investigation system for all levels should be implemented.</p>
<p>9.  Improve the Efficiency of Social Education</p>
<p>(A) Strictly assess social education personnel.</p>
<p>(B) Determine the standard of treatment for social education personnel at all levels.</p>
<p>(C) Eliminate the waste of social education institutions.</p>
<p>(D) Actively carry out literacy campaigns.</p>
<p>(E) Complete the establishment of the Provincial Zhenjiang Library within this period.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Years Two and Three: Expansion Period <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Items that have not been completed in the first year of organization should still be actively carried out during this period. The expansion that should be carried out during this period includes compulsory education, normal education, vocational education, and social education.</p>
<p>1. Increase Funding</p>
<p>(A) Establish county clearing houses and committees to increase educational funding. (B) Investigate and recover the assets of abandoned temples and recover publicly owned assets that have been privately occupied. (C) Award generous prizes for donating to establish schools. (D) Increase the income of the provincial educational forests.</p>
<p>2.  Actively Expand Primary School Education</p>
<p>(A) Increase the number of primary schools. During the organizational period in the first year, increasing the number of grades and student quotas can increase the number of enrolled children by 137,560. Counting the original number of enrolled children of 580,820, there are a total of more than 710,000 enrolled children. However, there are still approximately 3,995,296 out-of-school children in the province. According to the National Education Conference plan, which stipulates universal compulsory education within 20 years, the number of out-of-school children should be reduced by 5% each year, which is an increase of 200,000 enrolled children. Therefore, starting from the 22nd year, the province should increase the number of primary schools by 4,000 grades (50 students per grade), with a cost of 250 yuan per grade, requiring a total of 1 million yuan per year. In addition, the newly added primary schools should use temples and other public assets as school sites, with an opening cost of approximately 150 yuan per grade, requiring a total of 600,000 yuan. The total cost of recurring expenses and opening costs in the 22nd year is 1.6 million yuan. This large sum seems daunting at first glance, but if the county's funding and school assets are actively cleared and all malpractices are eliminated, it will not be difficult to raise this funding. If it is indeed difficult to raise sufficient funding and the number of schools cannot be increased as planned, then actively improving private schools to accommodate school-age children can also supplement the inadequacy of primary schools.</p>
<p>(B) Jointly increase the number of complete primary schools.</p>
<p>(C) Increase vocational subjects and practice fields in higher primary schools.</p>
<p>(D) Promote the central primary school district system.</p>
<p>3. Expand Normal Education</p>
<p>(A) Complete the independence of normal middle schools throughout the province. The independence of normal middle schools throughout the province should be completed within the next two years and their equipment should be supplemented to an appropriate level.</p>
<p>(B) Enrich the content of rural normal schools. Within the next two years, the physics and chemistry equipment of all rural normal schools in the province should be supplemented to an appropriate level. Starting from the 22nd year, a rural high school normal department should be added to each rural normal school, selecting junior high school graduates with excellent grades who are willing to serve in rural primary schools to study for two years. (C) Increase the departments of provincial normal colleges. During this period, in addition to the original literature, history, and geography departments, mathematics, physics, and chemistry departments should be added, and the equipment of each department should be actively completed.</p>
<p>(D) Increase the number of normal schools to prepare for compulsory education teachers. According to the investigation, only over 1,600 normal school graduates graduate each year in this province. Even if all of them serve in primary schools, it is not enough. Moreover, most of them go on to higher education or change to other jobs. During this period, the number of primary school grades must increase by 4,000 grades each year, which means that 4,000 more normal school graduates should be added each year, calculated at 50 students per class. 80 more classes of normal school students should be added each year. However, since the 21st year is the organization period and funding is also difficult, it has been changed to be added starting from the 22nd year. During this period, if there are not enough teachers, qualified personnel who have passed the primary school teacher certification can be appointed. It is estimated that starting from the 22nd year, 80 more classes of normal school students will be added each year, with a recurring cost of approximately 50 yuan per class including food expenses, totaling 400,000 yuan. If half of the classes are added to existing normal schools, the equipment cost will be increased by 500 yuan per class, with 40 classes requiring 20,000 yuan. For the remaining 40 classes, the opening cost will be 20,000 yuan per school, divided among ten schools, requiring a total of 200,000 yuan. The total cost of implementing this plan is approximately 620,000 yuan. This funding can be paid from the increased revenue from reorganizing the provincial funding tax sources. However, to ensure the funding is reliable, this plan will be implemented in phases over two years.</p>
<p>(E) Implement the graduation association system for normal middle schools throughout the province.</p>
<p>(F) Hold summer workshops.</p>
<p>4. Expand the Content of Vocational Education</p>
<p>(A) Supplement all the necessary equipment inside and outside the schools of agricultural, sericultural, aquatic, and industrial vocational schools to an appropriate level, and expand fishing village normal schools.</p>
<p>(B) In response to the industrial environment, actively enrich the equipment of Suzhou Industrial School to pave the way for establishing specialized departments and, when necessary, prepare to establish other engineering departments.</p>
<p>(C) The practice fields established by various vocational schools must be managed in accordance with agricultural and industrial economic principles, and the results obtained must reach at least 80% of the original plan.</p>
<p>(D) During these two years, special attention should continue to be paid to integrating the vocational education undertakings that have already been carried out in the province with various industrial organizations run by businesses, provinces, and countries.</p>
<p>(E) Establish various simple vocational supplementary schools</p>
<p>5. Enrich the Content of General Middle Schools</p>
<p>(A) Supplement all the equipment of provincial middle schools that has not been enriched to a considerable level</p>
<p>(B) Implement the system of regional joint examinations for middle school graduates on a trial basis</p>
<p>(C) Implement the system of departmental inspection of middle schools</p>
<p>6. Continue to Actively Encourage Literacy Education</p>
<p>(A) In addition to running various undertakings, local social education institutions should continue to focus on encouraging literacy education. By the end of this period, the number of illiterate people should be reduced by 20%.</p>
<p>(B) Establish more public schools, open-air schools, forest schools, public night schools, and public literacy centers.</p>
<p>(C) Extend the graduation period of public schools appropriately, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>7. Increase the Number of Social Education Institutions</p>
<p>(A) Establish one provincial public education hall each in the former Huaiyang District and Susongtai District.</p>
<p>(B) Establish one provincial library each in suitable locations in Jiangnan and Jiangbei.</p>

<p>Telegrams Ren Shuyong to Preside Over Central University</p>
<p>Since the National Government appointed Ren Shuyong as the president of Central University, Ren has not yet taken office because the funding problem of the school is not easy to solve. The government then appointed Liu Guanghua, the current dean of the Law School of the school, to temporarily act as the president. Once Ren went south because of something, the teachers and students of the school, after hearing the news, sent representatives to petition President Wang, requesting that he telegraph Ren to come to the school as soon as possible to take charge of the school affairs in order to promote the progress of the school affairs. Yesterday (the 20th), the Ministry of Education telegramed Wuhan University to forward it to Ren, saying that the summer vacation is approaching and all plans for the next semester of Central University should be planned and decided before the holiday. I sincerely hope that you will come to Beijing as soon as possible to preside over the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Recording of Knocking the Bell in the Old Temple (II) Not Removing the Weeds in the Courtyard by Zhaifu <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The messenger of culture travels in China on a particularly slow train. Hải 亘史 invented the pendulum clock as early as 1656, but we have never bought a chiming clock in this old temple. No one in the village has ever seen this thing. In the past, everyone woke up in the morning to the crowing of the rooster, and started cooking dinner in the evening after watching the sunset. Since I took on the job of ringing the bell, it seems that everyone relies on me to report the time. I ring the bell three times a day... once in the morning, called the dawn bell; once at noon, called the noon bell. The villagers go to bed when they hear me ring the evening bell, get up when they hear me ring the dawn bell, and eat lunch when they hear me ring the noon bell. These have almost become the unwritten constitution of the villagers.</p>
<p>One day, I discovered a strange thing! Zhang Huzi in the village smokes opium according to the sound of the bell in the old temple. The evening bell awakens his sweet dreams, and he picks up his gun and indulges in opium. As soon as the dawn bell rings, he doesn't care about anything and lies on the bed with his limbs stretched out in the shape of the Chinese character for "sky", without moving. Taking off his clothes and covering himself with a quilt are all left to his young wife to take care of.</p>
<p>This was what Zhang's old mother, Shen Da's wife, told me when she came to the temple to burn incense. I then began to doubt my work. I questioned myself... "What is the meaning of ringing the bell? To wake someone up to smoke opium... to be the rooster of someone who smokes opium... does this deserve to be my life's work?" I doubted for many days, and once I almost went on strike. But time bleached away this doubt. I found out clearly that the majority of people who are woken up by me in the morning go to farm and work, and those who are woken up by me in the evening to smoke opium are only a small minority. Later, I made a new determination... Even if ringing this big bell only has the power to wake up one person to farm and work, I am still willing to continue ringing it until I am unable to ring it anymore.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>In my hands, I hold the key to the work and rest of the entire village. Can I ring this big bell casually? If I am a little late today and a little early tomorrow, wouldn't that be a breach of trust? How can I ring this bell accurately? I am ringing the bell while racking my brains to find a solution.</p>
<p>The time of the noon bell is relatively easy to determine. I see the sun shining on people, and a black shadow falls on the ground. When the sun is in the east, the shadow falls in the west; when the sun is in the west, the shadow falls in the east; when the sun is in the south, the shadow falls in the north. When the sun rises, the shadow is infinitely long. After that, the sun gradually rises higher, and the shadow gradually becomes shorter, until the sun is at the top, and the shadow becomes the shortest. After this, the sun gradually lowers, and the shadow gradually lengthens again, until the sun sets and the shadow becomes infinitely long again. When the sun is at the top, the shadow shrinks from long to shortest and wants to lengthen from shortest, it is the local noon. At this time, the sun is in the due south, and the shadow is in the due north. Draw a line according to the shadow, which is the meridian, that is, the north-south line. I use this principle to take a straight bamboo pole and insert it straight into the ground. How to insert a bamboo pole straight? I learned this little skill from the bricklayer, Li Sibao, when he was building a wall. Anyone who is willing to observe the bricklayer building a wall will understand this principle. When the weather is clear, I wait for the pole shadow to be short and short, short to the point where it cannot be shorter and intentionally lengthens, and then I start ringing my noon bell. A bell rings, everyone is happy, and the whole village is preparing to enjoy their lunch... I was wrong again. Soon I discovered that there are many working people who have no lunch to eat. Hearing the noon bell but not being able to eat lunch, what kind of life is this? I would rather not ring this sad noon bell.</p>

<p>There was talk that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway would resume operations on the 20th, but it was delayed due to the Japanese army delaying its withdrawal. However, the section between Nanjing and Xiang has officially resumed operations. As for the Zhenru area, the Japanese army has scheduled to withdraw tomorrow morning (the 23rd). The Japanese army will also withdraw from the North Station on the afternoon of the same day. The Railway Bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to take over the North Station. In addition to the twelve railway police officers who entered the station to guard it the day before yesterday, more than ten laborers wearing symbols issued by the Japanese army were sent to the station yesterday (the 21st) to organize various miscellaneous items and clean the platforms. It is also understood that many craftsmen from the railway have been ordered to stay temporarily in the Huashang Hotel on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, waiting for the Japanese army to withdraw so that they can immediately enter the station to repair the station building, in order to fulfill the prediction of a trial run on the 25th and resuming operation on the 28th.</p>

<p>Mortgages and Long-Term Extensions, Interest Paid as Usual</p>
<p>War Zone Sends Letter to the Rehabilitation Committee to Handle</p>
<p>The Citizen's United Association, the General Federation of Commerce of All Roads, the French Concession Business Federation, and other three groups, each formed a restoration committee. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the fifth committee meeting was held at the Citizen's United Association. Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Jiang Junyi, Qu Zhenhua, Li Weiliang, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Jian, She Hualong, Secretary Cao Zhigong, and others attended. Hu Fengxiang chaired the meeting, and Zhao Ziyun recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported that the general closure of accounts for the 20th year would be implemented at the end of May this year. Various places have sent letters requesting the association to preside over the handling of the matter. How should this be handled? Please make a public decision. Everyone agreed that since the January 28th Incident in this port, all industries have embraced patriotic enthusiasm and stopped operations for two months, extending to April 1st. Although they reluctantly reopened for business, due to the losses from more than two months of closure and the lack of business after reopening, some were so deserted that they could hardly maintain a livelihood, let alone recover their business. It is impossible in reality to clear all accounts in the shortest possible period. It is not only that the general merchants and people feel great difficulties. After reviewing the letters from various places, they are all true. Relief should be provided to directly address the difficulties of the majority of merchants and indirectly remove the impossibility of the silver and money industries. As a result, the following was resolved: (1) Regarding the issue of closing accounts at the end of May: (A) Mortgages and long-term loans should continue to be extended, and interest should be paid as usual. (B) Loans to all households should be closed at the end of the year. (C) A letter should be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask the silver and money industries to accommodate. (2) Regarding the issue of closing accounts in the war zone, a letter should be sent to the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee to handle it. Secretary Cao Zhigong was appointed to draft the letter.</p>

A letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council to negotiate: To Whom It May Concern: According to Gao Lanzhou's letter, nearly one million Chinese reside in the concession and have the obligation to pay taxes. The Shanghai Municipal Council sends people to collect taxes quarterly. When the donation collectors arrive at the residents' homes to collect taxes, their manner and prestige are beyond description in words. It is believed that your council members, who reside in the concession, must see these people four times a year with their prestigious manner. Lanzhou is a doctor who has resided in Shanghai for nearly twenty years. He currently resides at No. 76, the corner of Lloyd Road and Niuzhuang Road, and has established the Neutral Hospital for three years. Each time the Shanghai Municipal Council sends people with donation tickets to collect taxes from us, we pay promptly, fearing delays. On the morning of the 19th of this month, around 9 a.m., a certain Chinese man sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council entered the room with a fierce expression and the sound of boots. Lanzhou stood up to welcome him and politely asked if he could pay with a sight draft as he was running low on cash. Upon hearing this, the Chinese man responded with a thunderous voice, shaking his head, extending his waist, and waving his hand, saying "No, no, no." He repeated the two words and added, "Hurry, hurry." Lanzhou had no choice but to swallow his anger and politely negotiate. Who knew that the Chinese man would curse and turn around to leave, saying, "Go find money, I'll show you." A moment later, the Chinese man returned with another Chinese man and a Westerner. The original Chinese man was even more arrogant than before. He took out the donation ticket and demanded payment. Lanzhou said that a sight draft is no different from cash. If it is absolutely impossible to accommodate, please sit for a while while I borrow from friends and relatives. Before he could finish speaking, the Chinese man told the Westerner. The Westerner extended his evil palm and grabbed Lanzhou's throat and punched him in the mouth. The punch landed on the mouth, his tooth pierced his upper lip, and blood flowed down his face. The Chinese man kicked him repeatedly. His seventy-year-old mother heard the noise and came to the rescue, but was driven back by the Chinese man. The Westerner saw Lanzhou bleeding and realized that he had caused trouble. He ran out quickly, and the two Chinese men followed. Neighbors witnessed this and were angry but dared not speak. The carpenter can testify. This is all Lanzhou's personal experience. He humbly narrates this so that he can be vindicated. The issue of Lanzhou being insulted and injured is minor, but if this example is set, the Chinese residents of the concession will be in trouble. Advocating justice, and awaiting your decision, I will not say more. All the sales receipts from Renji Hospital have been kept at the Old Gate Police Station for verification. It is checked that the donation collector abused his power and injured people, which is detrimental to the Shanghai Municipal Council's discipline and infringes on the legal rights of residents. This trend should not be allowed to continue. According to the letter, it is appropriate to send a letter to you, hoping that you will investigate, quickly dismiss the three people, and pursue legal action.</p>

<p>To Yan Huijing Telegram: Geneva Representative Yan, forward to the International League of Nations, all Japanese troops withdrawing from Shanghai have already invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces. The three northeastern provinces are our country's territory. No matter how the Japanese try to conceal the facts, establishing the Manchukuo to deceive the world and achieve their sinister schemes, according to the Washington Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty of the League of Nations, it is undoubtedly Chinese territory. Moreover, the rampant Japanese warlords are now provoking incidents at Yuguan. If the League of Nations does not immediately warn Japan to stop its advance, it will inevitably lead to world war. The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>He Zhuguo's Telegram: To the National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China, I have read your telegram and am deeply grateful for your diligent encouragement and guidance. I will certainly remember my original intention. I only hope that the people of the country will calmly respond to the changes, unite, and strive to become stronger. Even though we are separated, it is as if I am receiving your instructions in person. Special reply, He Zhuguo, deleted.</p>

<p>Honoring the Sacrifice in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Staff Officer Teng Jiushou of the Wusong Fortress Command sacrificed his life in the recent war of resistance. All sectors deeply regretted the news. The Association for the Nurturing of Families of Soldiers Who Died for the Country believed that Teng's family should be given appropriate consolation to fulfill the responsibility of those who survived. Yesterday, a special allocation of 2,000 yuan was entrusted to Zhao Jun Jinqing to be remitted to Teng's family.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Wang Zao Shi's Conversation <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zao Shi, one of the strongest advocates for ending tutelage, made the following remarks to visitors yesterday: (Question) Is it possible to take the road of constitutionalism? Wang (Answer) At a time when foreign insults are pressing and people are living in poverty, I am extremely reluctant to see any more internal revolutions and conflicts. Therefore, in addition to lecturing, I have followed social figures in the hope of ending tutelage and implementing constitutionalism through peaceful means and a fighting spirit, to put politics on a normal track and avoid constant internal strife. However, whether this peaceful method will be effective depends on whether the ruling Kuomintang is aware of the situation. If the rule becomes increasingly dark and corrupt and refuses to return power to the people, it will inevitably lead to a great revolution and bloodshed. I observe the situation in all aspects of the country and the future trends of the world, and I fear that this kind of tragedy cannot be avoided. Our current call to end tutelage will be of no avail, but it is only to fulfill our duty and put our minds at ease. (Question) It is said that Mr. is an important figure in the National Socialist Youth Party, is that true? Wang (Answer) Now, anyone who criticizes the Kuomintang but is not like the Communist Party is suspected of being a national socialist from the Kuomintang's perspective. Therefore, the publications run by the Kuomintang even claim that the Shanghai University Professors' Association for National Salvation is controlled by national socialists, and point out that Xie Xunchu, Wu Zelin, Zhang Yi, Zhu Qinglai, and other gentlemen are all national socialists, which is not true. I am neither a Youth Party member, nor a Communist Party member, and certainly not a Kuomintang member. To this day, I still have no party affiliation. Kuomintang people often label people outside the party, which is tantamount to increasing the prestige of others and weakening their own morale, which is unwise. As for my personal active political views, I plan to publish a journal in the future to publish them one after another.</p>

<p>The Hengtai Lane Tenants' Association on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou District, in view of the fact that the tenants in the lane have suffered considerable losses due to the war, has specially sent representatives Guo Ziqing to negotiate with the landlord, Hengyu Feng Real Estate Company, in accordance with the rent reduction methods formulated by the Municipal Rent Reduction Movement Committee. The company's leasing director, Mr. Huang Jieqian, has now accepted and approved the waiver of three months' rent for February, March, and April. All previous debts are also allowed to be paid in installments. Therefore, the tenants in the lane are very satisfied. The situation has been reported to the Rent Reduction Association.

<p>The First District Party Department of this city, in view of the slight losses suffered by the citizens after the war, will automatically reduce the rent for one month for several buildings in Meijialong, inside the city of Nanshi, managed by the district department, before the municipal government promulgates any methods, to show its concern. It is also heard that the Dagong Elementary School attached to the district party department will expand its classrooms starting next semester, and the original houses are not enough. Therefore, the tenants in the district department's main gate were asked to move out. In addition to waiving one month's rent, a moving fee for one month was also posted.</p>

<p>According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, regarding the case of propagating reddening to the army and navy units dispatched to Shanghai at the beginning of the Shanghai Incident, it has now been found that the plan of the left-wing students came from students of the East Asian Common Script Academy in Zhabei, Shanghai. Among them, Nakamura Taro, Lin Wenxiong, Shinjo Norimitsu, Nakanishi Ichiro, Yasuzai Tomoharu, Ozaki Sotaro, and other six people were members of the Japanese Communist Party and members of the Japanese Communist Youth League. When the Shanghai Incident situation became serious in mid-February, they vigorously propagated reddening and skillfully incited the army and navy to mutiny. After careful investigation by the Special Higher Police Division of the Metropolitan Police Department, the six people have been arrested and transferred to the prosecutor's office for disposal. (It was rumored in mid-February that there was a mutiny in the Japanese Navy, opposing the imperialist war. The military authorities sent the people back to their country. This proves that the rumor was not false.)</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association believes that there are many reasons for the suffering of the people due to natural disasters such as floods and droughts, calamities caused by soldiers and bandits, and foreign aggression. The biggest reason is the frequent internal wars in the country, which have led to the destruction of construction and the impoverishment of people's livelihoods. In order to resist foreign aggression for a long time, to seize the final victory, and to develop civil rights and carry out construction, there must be no more wars in the country. Therefore, it is necessary to initiate a domestic non-war movement. It is heard that the association is now preparing methods and will publish a declaration.</p>

<p>Report on the Disaster Situation in Southern Henan</p>
<p>The counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Shangcheng, and other counties in southern Henan have long been occupied by the Red Bandits. After repeated suppressions, they have not been completely eliminated. The Henan party, government, and military authorities, in view of the lack of coordination, which gave the enemy an opportunity, specially divided the eight counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Xishui, Shangcheng, Xinyang, Luoshan, and Zheng into a special zone to organize a Pacification Committee to coordinate party, government, military, suppression, and pacification. In the past three months, it has achieved considerable victories. However, since the local area suffered a flood last year, followed by the scourge of the Red Bandits and the rampant bandits, not only are ten houses empty, but there are no houses to be empty. The Pacification Committee is responsible for pacification but has no power to provide relief. Therefore, the committee sent committee member Yang Yifeng, and concurrently the magistrate of Huangchuan County and the commander of the 20th Route Guerrilla, Mei Zhichao, together with Li Huanying, a member of the Henan Relief Association, to Beijing and Shanghai to appeal. After arriving in Shanghai, they have been appealing to charitable organizations such as the Flood Relief Committee, the Flood Relief Emergency Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, the China General Relief Association, and the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, and to philanthropists such as Xu Jingren, Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Huang Jinrong, and Du Yuesheng. All charitable organizations and philanthropists have promised to do their best to help. In addition to the major philanthropists having already allocated 700 bags of rice for relief from the Red Cross's rice relief fund, they have also promised to do their best within the Flood Relief Committee. Yesterday at 12 noon, Li Huanying, Mei Zhichao, and Yang Yifeng hosted a banquet for the major philanthropists here at the Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. More than a dozen guests came, including Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, and Li Xiaodong. After taking their seats, Yang Yifeng delivered a speech reporting on the suppression of the Red Bandits and the disaster situation in the special zone (the speech is omitted). Various photos of the disaster situation were also shown. The guests and hosts dispersed happily until 3 p.m.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Jiangsu Province War Zone Relief Committee received an official letter from the Qingpu County Government yesterday, stating that the Japanese army had completely withdrawn from the northeastern part of the county. On May 15, the county magistrate supervised the district chief to personally inspect Huangdu Town in the county. They saw broken tiles and dilapidated walls, and everything was in sight. Then they went to Lijialou, Yang'e Bang, Caijiaqiao, Zhuangchi, Luojia Village, Xujia Village, and other places. Some villages were completely burned by the Japanese army, or were demolished by the Japanese army before leaving. Most of the agricultural tools, miscellaneous items, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., were robbed and eaten by the Japanese soldiers, leaving nothing. They then went to Guanyintang and other places in Beiwang Village. The disaster situation was roughly the same. Finally, they went to the railway station and saw that all the station buildings had been burned, and the 23rd foreign bridge had also been bombed. According to the inspection, the property loss is estimated to be more than 500,000 yuan. If no measures are taken for</p>

<p>Immediate relief, how can we bring back the refugees and comfort the victims? In addition to submitting the report to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, the situation of the Huangdu war zone in the county has been reported accordingly, hoping that it will be investigated and prompt relief measures will be taken.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Shanghai representatives of the Qingpu War Disaster Relief Association borrowed 3,000 yuan from the Taijia Bao Three-County War Disaster Relief Joint Association, which is one percent of the 300,000 yuan of bonds issued by the province, as an emergency relief for the Huangdu war zone. It can be distributed soon, but it is still not enough. The association has also submitted a request to the Provincial War Zone Committee for additional relief.</p>

<p>Letter to the Taxpayers' Association to Forward to the Shanghai Municipal Council for Negotiation</p>
<p>A letter from Lao Fulaie Company on Wuzhou Road to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association stated: "To Whom It May Concern: Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the merchants and residents of our Hongkou District have borne the brunt. Although we have not suffered the tragedy of artillery fire, the killings and atrocities committed by the Japanese army in recent months are no different from a war zone. The residents have all evacuated, and the entire district has fallen into chaos. The market is depressed and has not yet recovered. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council has taken the initiative to exempt us from the war-time patrol tax, which is greatly appreciated by the merchants and residents. Unexpectedly, we received a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating that the liquor licenses for the spring and summer seasons still require us to pay the tax, and instructed us to go to the council to collect the licenses within three days. Considering that in this Shanghai Incident, the Japanese army used the concession as a base, and the Shanghai Municipal Council did not take measures to stop it, causing the residents of the entire city to suffer great losses. During the war period, the entire Hongkou District was closed. The so-called liquor license for business is almost like waste paper. Therefore, it is only reasonable that our war-time liquor tax should be exempted in the same way as the patrol tax. How can it be an exception? Therefore, we ask your association to uphold justice and forward the request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for prompt negotiation, so as to achieve the goal of exemption, reduce losses, and maintain the difficulties of the merchants. This is our earnest prayer. Sincerely, the Old Fulaie Company on Wuzhou Road in Hongkou, May 21."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Zhejiang People Organize Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Office Established in the French Concession</p>
<p>The declaration of the Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association states: The Wenzhou-Chu salt region of Zhejiang Province was originally a tax-exempt area. After the seventh year of the Republic of China, the inspection offices were changed to tax collection at the salt production sites, allowing for free trade. The tax revenue began to flow smoothly. The annual regular tax revenue was between 600,000 and over 700,000 yuan. Officials and the people lived in peace, and the achievements were remarkable. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Liangzhe Transportation Commissioner, due to a slight delay in revenue collection, rashly changed to commercial contracting. This practice has continued to this day, leading to numerous malpractices. It is said that there are those who govern people but lack governing methods, as the sages of the past discussed in detail. Initially, the slight delay in revenue collection was due to improper methods and lack of effort by the people. Therefore, after changing to commercial contracting, the deficit became even more severe. Contractors requested reductions in the contracted amount midway, sought to evade national taxes, and merchants and police committed murder and framed innocent people, leaving commoners with no avenue for appeal. Furthermore, merchants raised salt prices and fraudulently reported and embezzled funds. All kinds of evil phenomena became increasingly strange. Contractors monopolized the market, exploiting the common people, causing unbearable suffering. Salt officials colluded, preventing the grievances of the people from reaching the authorities. The members of this association are deeply concerned about this situation. Therefore, we gathered comrades to organize this association, aiming for the happiness of our homeland. We are determined to relieve the people from their suffering, feeling it is our undeniable responsibility. We held a meeting on May 17th and established the association. All elders and brothers of our two prefectures, regarding matters that should be promoted or reformed in salt administration, should send letters to this association at any time. We will compile them into proposals, discuss and decide upon them, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance and the Transportation Department for consideration. In case of any facts of officials and merchants harming the people, detailed evidence should be collected and sent to this association, which will forward it to the supervisory court for investigation, punishment of the wicked, and improvement according to the law, striving to provide support. In this way, the grievances of the people will not be blocked from reaching the authorities, and the malpractices can be reformed immediately, benefiting the people and the country. We hope that the elders and brothers of our two prefectures will share this responsibility with this association. Simple regulations of the Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association: (1) The purpose of this association is to improve salt affairs, benefit the people, and benefit the country.

<p>Zhabei War Zone has been undergoing organization, and the Commercial Press and Oriental Library on Baoshan Road have been hiring large numbers of laborers to clean up the remaining walls and broken rafters, busying themselves with post-war affairs. A laborer named Wu Da was working at the Oriental Library when he picked up a bomb in the ruins. He threw it to the ground, and it exploded with a loud bang. Wu Da was the first to be hit by the explosion and died on the spot. Three other companions were also injured: Xu Zhengwen, who was injured in the left hand and shoulder; Ding Zhongxiang, who was injured in both hands and whose life is in danger; and Zuo Shuan, who was injured in the right hand. The corpse was reported to the court for examination by the local security. The injured were rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

<p>Eight Ax Wounds on His Body</p>
<p>Associated with the Underworld</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the body of a young man who had been assassinated was found in a wheat field near the Siming Guild Hall west of Qichang Pier in Pudong. Cao Linhua, the local security of the sixteenth district, reported the incident to the local court, which dispatched a judge to the scene for examination at 4:00 PM. The deceased was about twenty years old, wearing a blue short shirt and trousers, with a leather belt around his waist. There were eight axe wounds on his right cheek, left forehead, top of the head, and back of the head, with blood and flesh blurred. About five or six feet to the left and right of the body, there were two large piles of bloodstains, as well as a duckbill cap and two black velvet shoes worn by the deceased, and several clumps of hair. It was evident that the deceased struggled fiercely with the murderer during the attack. The judge determined that the axe wounds were inflicted before death, causing fatal injuries. After the examination, as there were no relatives of the deceased, it was ordered that photographs be taken and the body placed in the hall for identification. According to the general public, the deceased was named Xiao A'nan, from Nanhui. He used to work as a carpenter in a shipyard in Lujiadu, Pudong. He had an elderly mother and younger brother. He was only twenty years old and not yet married. Recently, he abandoned his profession and associated with the underworld, relying on extortion to make a living. It is suspected that he was murdered by his accomplices.</p>

<p>Gao Changren, a 33-year-old man from Funing, residing at No. 82 Tanziwan, Panjiawan, Zhabei, was a foreman. He lived with his elderly mother and wife in a rural house made of bamboo fences. Yesterday morning at 4:00 AM, someone suddenly called outside the door. Gao thought it was an emergency and went outside in his thin clothes. When he reached the door, men in short clothes each brandished a pistol and fired at Gao. One bullet hit the inside of his mouth, penetrating his head, while another pistol was fired into his left breast, passing through his waist. He fell to the ground and died instantly. His mother and wife were both awake and witnessed the murderers fleeing without a trace past the thatched shed. They embraced the body and wept bitterly. After properly handling the funeral arrangements yesterday afternoon, they reported the incident to the local court for examination.</p>

<p>Jin Baoyu, a new probationary detective No. 61 of the French Concession Police, was checking pedestrians at the intersection of Route Ghisi and Rue Belles Vues at 8:20 PM on the 6th of this month when he encountered robbers who opened fire to resist arrest, hitting him in the head and killing him instantly. A stray bullet also killed a pedestrian named Qian Achun. At that time, patrolmen No. 65 captured a robber named Wang Ziqing from Henan Province, seizing a Mauser pistol and 19 bullets. Furthermore, Jin Jiulin, an inspector of the special agency, led detectives of the same shift to No. 2, Lanfang Lane, Zhaojiabang Road in the Chinese area, and the Lin'an Hotel on Guangdong Road in the Public Concession, arresting seven accomplices, including Liu Biao, Wang Shoujing, Zheng Chang, Chuan Shunqing, Chuan, surnamed Pan, Wang Yousheng, and Wang Jusheng, seizing two pistols and seven bullets. The rest have been interrogated and detained by the Second Special Court, and the case is under investigation. All details have been reported in previous newspapers. The police have now found that the defendants were all soldiers. Wang Ziqing, Wang Yousheng, and Wang Jusheng, along with Wang Guozhong, Li Shigen, Zhang Qiang, and others who are still at large, robbed the home of Yuan A'gen at No. 13, Qingshun Lane, Route Amiral Courbet on February 16, the home of Zhou Yingshi on Zilaihuo Street, and the store opened by Shen Pinzai at No. 30, Route Amiral de Préfeln, on March 10 and May 2, dividing the loot. On the night of the incident, they attempted to rob the Zhenhe Medical Garden at No. 28, Route Sainte-Marie, but failed and turned back. They were encountered by Liang, who checked them, and they resisted arrest by opening fire, killing Detective Jin. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the police escorted Wang and others back to the court. Judge Li Changnian and Clerk Wu Shan presided over the continued trial in the First Criminal Court. First, Police Lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the police investigation and prosecuted them for murder and robbery under Articles 282 and 346 of the Criminal Law, presenting the pistols and Mauser pistol as evidence. Wang Zijisong confessed that he was in Suzhou and was invited by Wang Guozhong, who is at large, to come to Shanghai on April 28. Because he had no money to use, his clothes were pawned. Helplessly, Wang Guozhong, Wang Yousheng, Wang Jusheng, and himself robbed a meat shop owned by a Shen, obtaining 130 yuan, of which he received nine yuan.

<p>Gao Jianying Claims Livelihood on the Brink of Ruin</p>
<p>Defendant Failed to Appear Yesterday</p>
<p>Pan Renru, residing at No. 174, Zikai Lane, Wuding Road, West Shanghai, is engaged in stock exchange business and is quite wealthy. Although he already has a family, his wife is not enough, and five years ago, he became entangled with a woman named Gao Jianying (also known as Runzhu). The woman is from Jiangsu Province, and at that time, she was seventeen years old. Her soft Wu dialect captivated Pan, and soon he built a golden house to hide her away. Over the past five years, Ms. Gao has given birth to a son and a daughter, and the green leaves have become lush, but her beauty has also diminished. Pan felt that her beauty was gradually fading, so his love also waned, and recently he has treated her like a stranger, abandoning her, causing her and her children to struggle to maintain their livelihood. Forced to do so, she hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to submit a petition to the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, requesting an order to summon Pan Renru to the court for mediation in accordance with the law, ordering him to pay 5,000 yuan for living expenses and damages, and 2,000 yuan for the education and upbringing of the children. The petition stated that Pan had maliciously abandoned her for the past two years, neglecting to provide support, causing her livelihood to be on the brink of ruin. Not only has she mortgaged everything she owns, but she is also in debt for 2,000 yuan, with no way to borrow money. Under such circumstances, the affection has been completely severed, and it is impossible to continue the relationship. Moreover, the son is four years old, and the daughter is only six months old. The future is long, and life must be sustained, debts must be repaid, and children must be raised. All of these require money. For this reason, she submitted the petition and requested the court to intervene. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Li Hu of the Civil Court opened the court to summon him, but Pan Renru did not appear, so the case could not proceed. Judge Li then ordered a second summons to Pan to appear in court and set a date for further consideration.</p>

<p>Sun Liande, a local, residing at No. 248 Tangshan Road, was an accountant in the freight department of the Great Lai Steamship Company at No. 3 Guangdong Road.

Detective Wang Rulin was dispatched to arrest Sun Liande and detain him in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Court No. 1. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case, and a Western witness named Jack, who speaks Chinese, testified that he was the bookkeeper in the Great Lai Company and that the actual amount embezzled by the defendant had not yet been determined. Therefore, he requested a postponement for further interrogation. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he had embezzled public funds due to financial difficulties. Judge Zhou Hanting verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Fang Xiaozhou's Family Suffers</p>
<p>At 5:20 AM yesterday (the 21st), just as dawn was breaking, five robbers suddenly broke into the home of Fang Xiaozhou, a local gang leader in Linjiagang, north of Caojiadu, West Shanghai. One robber stood guard outside, two robbers each held a sharp axe, and two robbers each held a pistol. They first fired several shots. Fang and his concubine, Ms. Yin, were sleeping soundly when they were awakened from their dreams by the sound. Fearing that they would raise an alarm and call the police, the two robbers holding the sharp axes repeatedly slashed at Fang and Ms. Yin's heads, causing them to faint in pain. The robbers then ransacked the chests and cabinets, robbing 120 yuan in silver dollars, 50 cents in small silver coins, and a pair of gold bracelets. They fled with the loot towards Zhongshan Road. Their family members took the two injured people to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. It was found that Fang had three knife wounds on his head, and Ms. Yin had two knife wounds on her head and face. They were bleeding profusely, and their injuries were quite serious. After receiving the report, the Sixth District Police Station, under the leadership of Director Zhang, ordered Inspector Xu to take Police Chief Hu Lizhong, Squad Leader Xia Pinshan, and Detectives Chen Keqing, Tang Bingxiang, Cao Chuqiao, Li Guiqing, Pei Yunzhang, and Ma Liang to immediately set out to search for the robbers. Soon after, they arrested a leading robber at No. 25, Dingkang Lane, Caojiadu Central Market, and brought him back to the district. After interrogation by Director Zhang, the robber confessed his name as Xu Aigen (nickname "Black Barbarian Dragon"), 28 years old, from Shanghai. He admitted to gathering accomplices to commit the robbery and slashing the victims. The pistols and sharp axes were taken away by his accomplices, and he did not know where they were hidden. After receiving the confession, Director Zhang further found that the robber had previously committed a robbery and was sentenced to two years in prison by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. He was released during the intense fighting in February of this year. He had long been rampant and lawless in the West Shanghai area, harming the local people, who feared and hated him. Now he dared to commit robbery and injure the victims again, which was an unforgivable crime. It was decided to detain him temporarily, pending the arrest of his accomplices, before further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Clarifying Doubts About the Non-War Construction Movement in China (Liu Zhan'en) <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>In general, people deeply cherish peace and love their country. To curb internal war and implement construction, four measures for domestic non-war construction have been proposed: (1) To establish a domestic non-war construction pact; (2) To adopt a policy of non-cooperation towards those who undermine domestic peace and participate in internal wars; (3) To reward leaders of peaceful construction; (4) To focus on peaceful construction propaganda. They are respectfully discussed with the Chinese people, hoping that all will rise up to implement them. After their publication, people from all walks of life responded positively, which shows that hating war and loving peace is a unanimous sentiment throughout the country. However, there are still some who harbor doubts about the non-war construction movement within the warlords. I respectfully submit my humble opinions to discuss with the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Some say, "The government loses its power and humiliates the country, and warlords divide the territory, often unfortunately leading to internal war. How should the people deal with this?" According to our current first hope, it lies in awakening the people, influencing the government, and making every effort to revitalize, strengthen ourselves, and start anew with the people. We should also influence the warlords, curb their ambitions, and serve the country. If the government disregards the fate of the nation and the survival of the people, and goes against the tide, losing its power and humiliating the country, then destruction is to be feared. We, the people, must use our entire strength to take positive and effective actions. If the warlords rely on their troops to achieve their goals, fighting endlessly, and insist on dividing the territory, then we, the people, should expose their secrets and remind the people of the country, and take appropriate measures. However, the sanctions against both parties must be resolved by non-violent means. Regardless of which party is suspected of this, the public opinion organs (which can be replaced by legally established folk professional groups before the establishment of formal national representative organs) should judge the merits and demerits and stop them. If this is not effective, and internal war unfortunately breaks out, then we, the people, must only strengthen the defenses and clear the fields, and refuse to cooperate with those who participate in internal war. The people have no military force and cannot place themselves in the midst of it. We should seek further solutions. Even if there is military force that can be used, who can guarantee that new warlords will not appear? Moreover, today's China has suffered greatly and is on the brink of destruction. No matter how we punish any disputes, we should not resort to force, which would only increase the suffering and plunge the nation and people into an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>Some say, "The cause of internal war has already been sown. If various political, social, economic, and livelihood problems are not resolved, internal war cannot be avoided." This statement is indeed very important. However, after an internal war, politics often becomes more corrupt, society becomes more unstable, the economy becomes more panicked, and livelihood becomes more difficult. It can be seen that frequent internal wars are not good, and their causes are complex and not just one. It is my opinion that we cannot talk about social transformation and national construction without first stopping internal war. The internal wars of past years have become more and more serious, and have not benefited the country or the people. It is an undeniable fact that we must first plan to prevent internal war, which is the removal of political, social, economic, livelihood, and other obstacles to progress.</p>
<p>Some say, "Verbal non-war, paper-based disarmament, and the initiative of a few people, what use is it?" I think that things are made by people. As long as the motive is pure and the struggle is persistent, there will be a day of success. In the past, all revolutionary undertakings were a million times more difficult when they first started. However, because of sincerity, even metal and stone can be penetrated. Therefore, with the efforts of a few people, they were able to awaken the people of the whole country. Today, we are promoting the domestic non-war movement. If we can truly make up our minds and sacrifice for peace, we will be able to influence the leading figures in the country and arouse the people to agree to participate. With this strong force, we can curb internal war. Even if we cannot see the immediate results, after a long period of time, we can eliminate the roots of future internal war and establish lasting peace. However, whether it can succeed depends entirely on whether we can make long-term efforts.</p>
<p>In short, today's China has experienced natural disasters such as floods and droughts, as well as the dangers of war, bandits, and thieves. The invasion of powerful enemies and the unprecedented national crisis are also just beginning. The fate of the country and the lives of the people are almost at their end. In this situation, there must be no more internal war. I hope that our compatriots will hold fast to their principles, cut through the thorns, unite as one, eliminate internal war, strive for self-reliance, and work hard to build the nation. With a spirit of selfless devotion, we must promote the domestic non-war construction movement and not stop until we achieve our goals.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Gold Market Fluctuates and Stalls <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>This week's situation is extremely chaotic. Yesterday, the 21st, the gold market saw slight changes, with constant ups and downs. There were seven or eight tael swings in the morning and afternoon, ultimately leveling off. Initially, it was expected to open higher due to the continued decline in the silver market. Later, different firms had varying demands for supply. As for foreign exchange, the British pound was stable and the US dollar was firm, but the market was still congested due to the trend of smaller exchange rates, mainly involving hedging transactions. The gold market took a winding and tortuous path, hovering around 720 taels, with people remaining hesitant. The market will be closed on Saturday as usual. This week's situation was chaotic, with fluctuations of ten taels at every turn. At the beginning of the week, it once broke through 700 taels, eventually reaching 687.5 taels, mainly due to the impact of the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister. Subsequently, the silver market frequently declined, but exchange rates remained strong, pushing through 730 taels. Later, due to the turmoil in the Japanese cabinet, it weakened and fell back below 720 taels, with a difference of about 43 taels between the high and low points. Overall, it rose slightly by four taels compared to last Saturday. The total number of transactions on the exchange was about 22,300. Here is a record of yesterday's market situation:</p>
<p>The opening price increased by two taels. The July market opened at 721 taels, up two taels. Large bars fell again by one-eighth to three-sixteenths. The silver price also decreased by one-eighth. However, the European market was not good, with more buying than selling. Even at the quoted price, it was still possible to increase by one-sixteenth. The gold price should have fallen, but the US dollar was still strong. Japanese merchants had already absorbed August at 31.1875 in the morning, so people's confidence turned firm. Then, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanmao, and others bought in, immediately adding one and a half taels, to 22.5 taels. Bingxing, Runchang Yu, and others sold, suddenly retreating by more than three taels, to 19 taels. Before long, Hongkang Yong, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, and others bought in, increasing by more than four taels, reaching 23.5 taels at 9:15. Then, it returned to 21 taels. Later, Zhifeng Yong, Hongli, and others bought in, returning up two and a half taels. The British gold opening price was 23.5 taels, but the listed price did not change. The domestic market seemed insufficient. Huashang Bank mutually traded September British gold at 1875. HSBC also offered August at 1875. As for the US dollar in September, they first absorbed 25, and then 375 was not easily sold. Furthermore, the Dalian gang and Yifeng Yong, Tongtaichang, Zhifeng Yong, Zhenxing, and others sold off, causing the price to plummet by six taels to 17.3 taels at 10:00. In an instant, the buying enthusiasm was high, including Fuchang, Fuyu, Xiexing Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Hongkang Yong, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, and others. Also, with banks and September US dollar at 375 to 3125, people's confidence turned high. There were even rumors that a certain bank bought more than 600 spot bars (but this was not confirmed). However, the market suddenly rallied, jumping up more than seven taels, reaching 25 taels after 10:30.</p>
<p>The closing price was only slightly better by two qian. Later, Tongtaichang, Richang, Yifeng, Yifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, and others came to sell off. Moreover, the exchange market suddenly loosened, and September should have been 375. Also, June traded against 30.8125, so the price fell back four or five taels. As it approached 11:00, it was 20.2 qian. Hongkang Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and the newly opened Hongxing bought in, so it picked up two taels, calculated at 22.5 taels. However, the Guangbang Yifeng and Daxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, and others worked hard to sell, until the price could not hold, falling by more than four taels. From 11:10 to 11:45, there were fluctuations of one tael each. It was then 17.9 qian. It was heard that HSBC bought September US dollar at 375, immediately rising two taels to 20 taels. At noon closing, it was 19.2 qian, only adding two qian compared to the previous day. However, Tongtaichang came in, pushing it up to 20 taels, then retreating to 20 taels again.</p>

The over-the-counter transactions were complex and chaotic. Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Yuantai, Dadecheng, Yuhe, Hongkang Yong, Yuanchun, and Yuankangxiang all bought in. Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Yifeng Yong, Futaiheng, Bingxing, Daxing Yong, Yifeng, and others all sold out. In addition, Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu, commodity hedging, etc., sometimes bought and sometimes sold.</p>

However, the HSBC listed price only reduced one yuan for the French franc and a small decrease of 25 for the German mark. The British, American, and Hong Kong dollars did not change. The domestic market saw the British pound stable and the US dollar tight, mainly due to the small exchange rate spread. Since the morning, the British pound was still stable, then seemed to loosen, with transactions of only thirty to forty thousand pounds. Banks traded against each other, and the gold gang rarely made deposits or withdrawals. The US dollar was firm and then weakened, with about four to five hundred thousand dollars in sales. Chinese merchants mostly sold off, hedging gold, while banks, such as British and Japanese merchants, all absorbed.

There were 1.5 million yuan in the first two transactions in the morning, and the afternoon market was sparse, with only over 500,000 yuan opened, totaling 2.09 million yuan. Among them, the 20 Customs, Rolled, Unified, and Salt Tax bonds each had around 300,000. Bond prices rose slightly compared to the previous day, but the fluctuations were even smaller, with only 0.2-0.3 yuan changes before and after the market. Compared to the previous day, it was only better by about 0.2 yuan. Only the 96 bond was slightly smaller by 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. In fact, there were no slight changes in the situation and diplomacy. Large firms were all watching and not moving, and the inflow and outflow of small firms was also rare. The supply and demand situation was balanced, and the trend of each price was increasingly stagnant. Judging from its future, it may be stable for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e177">A Week in Retrospect of the New York Stock Market <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Silver Company)</p>
<p>The past week's New York Stock Exchange market has been extremely dull. Taking industrial stocks as an example, the fluctuations have not exceeded the range of 53.00. There were no important news in the economic sector this week, and speculators were all watching and not moving forward. Therefore, transactions were rare, and the market was particularly calm. The market price of various stocks fluctuated by only a few points each day. Industrial stocks only rose 0.83 pounds this week. Railway and utility stocks did not improve, but fell a few points compared to the previous week. The reason why industrial stocks were particularly strong was partly due to the rise in wheat prices this week and partly due to the good atmosphere of the steel conference on the weekend. Although the reason for the weakness of utility stocks is difficult to trace, railway stocks fell due to the news of the reduction in dividends and poor business performance. However, there was good news in the banking sector on Friday. The Federal Reserve Bank has announced the formation of a committee composed of bankers and industrial and commercial leaders to adjust the activities of the banking and industrial and commercial sectors to make them closely connected. According to the study of exchange reports, most stocks fell during the week, but the decline has been less than before. The Dow Jones Index is attached as follows:</p>
<p>May 14 May 20 This Week's Fluctuation</p>
<p>30 Industrials 52.48 53.31 Increase 0.83 20 Railroads 17.83 17.67 Decrease 0.16 20 Utilities 22.60 21.73 Decrease 0.87</p>
<h3 id="e178">Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Weak <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still sluggish and showing signs of weakening because demand is stagnant. Each gang is completely still, and the political disputes in Guangdong Province have not subsided, and the financial situation is still tight. Due to these various reasons, the market is in a state of sadness. Fortunately, each factory has less stock of bottom goods than before, and the standard yarn price is smaller than the current yarn, so there is no sign of a sharp drop. However, considering the overall situation, there is very little optimism. In the afternoon, some people sold short due to cheaper raw materials.</p>
<p>Human Label is Extremely Tired: The opening of the human label in the morning market was particularly tiring due to the lack of buyers in the market and the dim actual sales. Each month fell by four, five, six, and eight qian. The shape was still inferior in the afternoon, with a few new sellers, and each month fell by one or two qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 7,000 bales. The sales were Xiesheng 450 bales, Dachang 250 bales, Yida 350 bales, Tongyu 750 bales, Tongfu 650 bales, and Yuda 150 bales. The purchases were Yuanda 200 bales, Dafu 150 bales, Jifeng 150 bales, Mingde 300 bales, Changfeng 500 bales, and Yuanda 200 bales. The closing price of human label is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Increase/Decrease Account Balance September 1532 Decrease 8 22,500 July 1527 Decrease 7 14,900 October 1534 7 25,100 August 1550 7 21,200 Total 83,700</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Quiet: A major inspection of current yarn business. Statistics of purchases from each gang throughout the day were only 209 bales. Fellow merchants bought 82 bales, Ningbo bought 15 bales, Mainland bought 32 bales, Jiangxi bought 20 bales, Yunnan bought 40 bales, and Shantou bought 20 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Cotton Market's Actual Sales Stagnate <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Cotton market consumption is greatly lacking, and factories rarely purchase. The price of foreign cotton is cheap, and foreign firms are very willing to accommodate and seek to sell off their goods. The factories have already absorbed enough, so there are no purchases seen. The situation of American cotton is currently brewing in stagnation, hovering between 0.0578. The Indian religious tide is still intense.</p>
<p>Zheng Label is Even More Sluggish: The market sentiment of Zheng Label is extremely weak. Foreign cotton is stable, but transactions are not moving, causing people's hearts to remain tired. Each month fell slightly by one or two qian. In the afternoon, it returned by 0.05 to 0.01 qian. Total transactions for the day were 5,700 dan. Sales were Tongyu 400 dan, Yida 300 dan, Changfeng 300 dan, Dachang 200 dan, Xiesheng 500 dan, and Ruiyuan 500 dan. Purchases were Taixing 300 dan, Tongxing 300 dan, Yifeng 500 dan, and Changhe 500 dan. The closing price of Zheng Label is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Label Closing Increase/Decrease Account Balance October 3255 Decrease 0.10 63,700 July 3235 Decrease 0.15 42,300 Total 164,300 August 3250 0.15 58,300</p>
<p>Current Cotton Mill Purchases are Very Few: Current cotton transactions are still calm. Only Hongzhang Factory bought 100 bales of Huoji flower at 29 taels 7 qian and 5 fen. The spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>

<p>Hu Nan: Only twenty or so rice boats from various gangs arrived on the west road yesterday. Each cargo lowered its opening price in the morning. By noon, the Shanghai River unloading fee was quite good, about 3,000 dan. Changxi's top goods arrival and sale were evenly matched, with no ups and downs. Early rice, thin rice, and Flying Phoenix were downstream. Bianyin yuan and foreign sharp goods were lacking, and prices rose by five fen.</p>
<p>Bei Shi: Yesterday, twenty-three or four boats arrived on the Suzhou River. Transactions in each rice shop were not smooth. Changzhou Wuxi white japonica rice had a slight appetite from the guest gangs. The opening price was stable, with a slight discount. Sutong, North, and Jiangyin rice had few outlets, showing an upstream trend. Early thin rice had a seemingly heavy accumulation of goods, and the market price was also discounted. The Lu Yang pointed rice arrived in two bamboo containers yesterday, calculated at 500 dan of goods. The full amount was sold completely, and the price was firm by one jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice remained sluggish. Only the Chongming Gang bought over a thousand bales at the very beginning, and the price was slightly带(dai - carrying, in a way indicating influence). In the afternoon, Wuxi and the local street inquired. The market stood firm平(ping - level, even, meaning steady). However, the foreign firms continued猛力(mengli - energetically, vigorously) 售(shou - sell, aggressively). There were new transactions for June and July Saigon rice. In July, 1,300 tons of Yuan were sold by Shunquanlong, priced at 5.5 taels. 200 tons of back goods were sold at noon, priced at 5.55 taels. Also, 200 tons of small school back goods were priced at 4.977. The current price for Mindang was 11.1 yuan for 500 bales, and small twist 6,000 bales, priced at 10.06 to 10.3 yuan. Also, the local street sold 300 to 400 bales of Jiangxi machine yuan, priced at 14.15 to 13.6 yuan. Also, 2,500 bales of red small twist were priced at 9.85 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Current Flour Sales are Slack with No Ups and Downs <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's current flour market initially saw some activity from local and guest customers, and market prices were once brisk. The soldiers had shouted up to 2.05 taels net盘(pan - disk, a market jargon referring to trading plate), a slight improvement of one fen compared to the previous day. Because Fuxin had a large inventory of flour, it had a slight intent to sell off. Therefore, people's confidence returned to softness. The final price quoted by the soldiers was still back to 0.04, similar to before. The current sales of other factories were also slack, and the market saw no ups and downs.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Silk and Tea: Red and Green Tea Transactions are Brisk <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market in this port's foreign firms saw total transactions of over 1,700 boxes of Qimen Fuliang Jiande and other red teas. Total transactions for Zhenmei, Zhenmei, and Xiamu and other green teas from both road and local firms were over 500 boxes. Transactions were generally brisk. Although there was not much change in the opening market price for red tea yesterday, because there were many arrivals, people's hearts were floating, and it was difficult to predict whether the market could stand firm. The green tea situation seemed more stable than the previous few days. The tea price had already reached a point where it could not fall further, and the merchants also let go and searched for goods, and the market trend was gradually moving towards the right track. From the overall situation, green tea was better than red tea.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Wu Tea Shops Have Already Weighed <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The production of new tea in Wuyuan, after days of picking and production, from the tea farmers has reached seven or eight tenths of the quota. Fortunately, the weather is often cold, although there is more rain and less sun, the tea body is still considered tender, and the tea farmers can also calmly pick and produce, without old grass. However, the yield is lower than before. Those who work diligently and fertilize have a harvest of eight tenths of previous years. Those who are barren, old, and lack manpower have only six tenths of the harvest compared to last year. In Wunei, Wainan, and various villages, at the beginning of the new tea picking, it happened that the banditry on the border had subsided. The tea farmers rushed to pick first, and it can be heard in recent days. More than a dozen tea shops in Taibai and other places in the township have rushed to open. The tea shops in Northeast Wu have also sent people to Cao Men, Long, and Xiaogang to purchase one after another, and there should be transactions and weighing within days.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Dexing Tea is Cheap Due to Banditry <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The quality of new tea in Dexing this year is quite good. Last month, because the Red Army in the area concentrated there, the tea farmers fled abroad, and no one picked it. The bandits and communists in the southern part of Dexing have been suppressed by the garrison troops, and the momentum is not as bad as before. Therefore, the tea farmers were reluctant to abandon their profits to the ground, and they all returned to pick when they had the opportunity. However, they did not dare to store the manufactured tea at home, and were willing to sell it at a low price. Each load only fetched 30 yuan. General profit-hungry tea merchants have been scrambling to report this and are trying to find a way to find goods.</p>

<p>The silk market in this port's foreign firms has been stagnant for several days. Chinese silk merchants unanimously believed that the prices offered by European and American firms were too low and insisted on not selling. The market was strong. Only Zhonghe Jin Niao Brand, five packages of seven-mile white dried warp, priced at 550 taels, and Xinfu Gongji Maisi Brand, five packages of seven-mile large warp, priced at 540 taels were made for covering short transactions. The market price continued to fall by more than 100 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Marked Market Step Up <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public meeting market of the sugar market was full of transactions. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand and white had very surging buying, but little outflow, so prices rose in steps. The transaction price reached 13.45 taels, and Hong Kong goods 13.35 taels, with very frequent transactions. Later, the outflow from the market was even quieter. Due to the increasingly thin stocks, people were even more enthusiastic and the market shape was slick. Medium sand and white shouted 13.2 taels, but rarely received hands. Dutch red was sluggish and heavily stocked, and the trend was average. Taikoo Sugar saw less transactions, but the sales were sluggish and the bottom was thin, so the market was very stable. Ri Mai rose to 14.1 taels, and Ri Mai 12.2 taels, the market was also firm.</p>

<p>The market trend for wood ear mushrooms has been sluggish recently. Top-grade Sichuan wood ear mushrooms from the producing areas were previously sold here for 66 taels. Now, even the locally-sourced varieties are flat and straight. Second-grade wood ear mushrooms are priced at 95-96 taels, while mixed-grade wood ear mushrooms from the producing areas are at 60 taels, with varying qualities. After adding all the external expenses, it is difficult to make a profit. Sales in the Shanghai market are extremely weak, so it is not yet the time for a price increase. Yesterday, the market price for second-grade wood ear mushrooms was 105-106 taels, standard-grade wood ear mushrooms were 63-64 taels, high-grade mixed wood ear mushrooms were 60 taels, and lower grades were 56-57 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e193">A Hasty Conclusion <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>My teacher, named Zotolio, was an Italian priest. He often said to me, "Chinese people lack thought. They should use their minds more." Thinking about it now, we still haven't gotten rid of this problem.</p>
<p>When reading foreign books, the emphasis is on thought, not recitation. The old method of reading Chinese books is the opposite. It emphasizes recitation, not seeking explanation. The ancients said, "To learn without thinking is futile; to think without learning is perilous." The method of reading foreign books is based on this principle. Our old method, on the other hand, has completely forgotten this famous saying.</p>
<p>Foreigners also had an old method of reading. To pass the "修才" (Bachelier) exam, Latin and Greek were required subjects. This is still the case today.</p>
<p>When I read foreign books, I first learned pronunciation, then phonetics. There are only 25 letters in pronunciation. It's considered done once you pronounce all 25 sounds accurately. It felt very easy. In phonetics, I first learned Romanization, then French phonetics, which was also not difficult.</p>
<p>Actually, studying in foreign schools might not be much better than ours. Latin and Greek are literature, poetry, prose, also literature. Our Four Books and Five Classics contain some political thought. Unfortunately, the old Chinese habit of "not seeking thorough understanding" is truly unbreakable. In the past, officials writing memorials to advise the emperor to do good deeds always spoke in a hesitant and roundabout manner, considering mawkishness amusing. After saying a few sentences, they dared not speak frankly. Logically, they should have spoken at greater length, expounded more thoroughly, and added words of encouragement. In the end, they still reached a hasty conclusion.</p>

<p>When General Wu Ziyu entered Sichuan in the past, it was reported that "the general let his wife ride the horse along the way, while he walked. The roads in Sichuan were rugged, and his feet developed thick calluses." I said that this was an absolutely beautiful poetic scene. I imagined that the general must have composed something at the time, but there was no news from afar. Therefore, I imitated Li Changji's method of supplementing Yu Jianwu's "Returning from Kuaiji Song" and composed a seven-character poem: "Once commanded a million brave soldiers, now in decline, suffering the long march in Sichuan. Extravagance can ruin a hero's career, hardship increases the love between husband and wife. In the Chu camp, a sad song for the unreturned horse, in the Wushan clouds, the lone goose cries mournfully. With the Xiongnu not yet destroyed, where is home? Gazing at the autumn wind, the White Emperor City is distant." A playful friend saw it and said that I was originally Liu Yong, the Willow Tun Tian of Xiaofengcanyue, but now I had become Su Shi, the iron-clad bronze pipa. Wearing the clothes of an actor, I actually looked like Mei Lanfang acting as Mulan joining the army. We both laughed together. Recently, while rummaging through my travel case, I suddenly saw this draft. I thought that Fuwei is now in Beiping, and letters can be delivered by mail. I rewrote it on a piece of paper and sent it for his review. A few days later, I received a reply personally written by the general, bestowing upon me five "朵郇雲" (praises) and awarding me eight characters of monthly commentary: "Classic and sonorous, truly a masterpiece." He also gifted me three of his new books. Small gifts in exchange for great returns, precious jade in return for generosity, truly a literary緣.</p>

<p>[Random Notes from the Old Capital, Part 4]</p>
<p>Yanjing University held a "New Student Welcome Party" at the Summer Palace for new students and professors. I was also invited as a guest and took this opportunity to tour the Summer Palace.</p>
<p>I had seen many pictures of the Summer Palace in the South, so when I stood by the edge of the rippling Kunming Lake, looking at the bronze ox nearby, the Dragon King Temple of Hunan, the Stone Bridge with Thirteen Arches, and the multi-storied buildings, palaces, pavilions, towers, and lush mountains on the north shore, and the pagoda of Fragrant Hills, I didn't feel like a stranger at all. What I felt was brighter than seeing pictures, and the colors in the pictures were far less striking and charming than the real lake and mountains. So I excitedly lingered in the garden for a whole day.</p>
<p>On the north shore, against the mountains, is a flower-snake-like long corridor. I don't know how long this corridor is, but judging by my imagination, it must be about two miles long. The beams and rafters in the long corridor are all exquisitely painted with flowers, plants, and figures. The long corridor is surrounded by greenery and flowering trees. The season is spring, and all the flowers are in bloom. A faint fragrance lingers around you, almost making you reluctant to leave. From time to time, slender waists, brightly colored curves, and soul-stirring legs flitted through the long corridor, especially embellishing this picture-like beauty into something like you'd see in a dream.</p>
<p>I also went to the palaces to see the portrait of Empress Dowager Cixi and everything she enjoyed during her lifetime. I also climbed the mountain, passing through many pavilions and courtyards with Buddha statues. But in the end, I spent a lot of time in that flower-snake-like long corridor. I felt that sitting here, quietly watching the flowers and the lake, I had leisurely become a person from ancient times, and I had also entered the Grand View Garden full of ladies.</p>

<p>A Strange Experience: Admiral Sir W. Goodenough, President of the Royal Geographical Society, recently told of a young man's strange experience. It was chilling to hear. One day, the young man was walking along a street in Malta when he saw a man bullying two women. He was impulsively moved by chivalry and rushed forward, punching and kicking the man to the ground. He then escorted the two women back to their home. The two women were very grateful and insisted that he stay for dinner. After dinner, he smoked a cigarette, chatted for a while, and then thanked them and left. The next day, he noticed that his cigarette case was missing. He knew that he had forgotten it in the women's house the night before. So he hurried back. But when he arrived, he found the house empty and locked. According to the neighbors, it had been empty for several years and no one lived there. He was half in doubt and half in belief, so he managed to enter the house. Sure enough, he saw that all the rooms were covered in dust and cobwebs. On a table in the dining room, however, was his cigarette case. He was stunned for a long time before fleeing in terror. Such a strange thing seems to force even those who don't believe in ghosts to consider the existence of ghosts.</p>

<p>Under the iron hooves of war, the prosperity of the marketplace and the grandeur of the city walls are all destroyed without a trace. How much more so the beauty of ponds, pavilions, bamboo, and trees? In the market town of Chaxi, there is a Guyi Garden, famous throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. Tourists come in droves, enjoying the pleasures of singing and wandering. A guest from Chaxi said that when the Japanese army invaded, the garden was occupied by cavalry. The Dunren Hall and the Water Surface Pavilion were trampled upon. Even the stacked stones in front of the Chunzao Hall have mostly collapsed and fallen to the ground, no longer retaining their rugged and towering appearance. What are his feelings about the rise and fall of the past and present? My late grandfather, Jin Tinggong, was buried in Zhangjingjiao, Chaxi. Every year, we would go there to sweep his grave with simple food and paper money. I still remember that last spring, I went to Zhangjing with Jingren and made a detour to explore the secluded beauty of Guyi Garden. We passed through the Nanmu Hall,穿柳帶軒, and followed the winding path to a boat room. In the room, we brewed a pot of clear tea. My heart was broadened. Looking to the left, the peach blossoms on the bank were blooming brightly, and most of them were double-petaled, with purple patterns and red sepals, competing in fragrance and beauty. There were also white flowers mixed with ochre spots, which were even more beautiful. Even the Dragon China Road on the sea could not compare. My wife and I lingered, reluctant to leave. We thought that even in this chaotic world, this small piece of land was enough to be a paradise and escape from Qin. Who knew that after only a year, the sounds of war drums and beacon fires would destroy the famous garden? Tears flow without flowers, and birds startle the heart. I wonder when we will be able to restore the old look and revisit the place. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Visit to the Condensed Milk Vacuum Machine <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Fang</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a friend in Hangzhou, urging me to visit the West Lake Condensed Milk Company. His words were earnest and insistent. At the end of the letter, he also said that since the outbreaks of the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the Chinese people have suffered greatly and deeply understand that today, unless we do our best to revitalize domestic products, we cannot talk about resisting and saving ourselves from danger. Now, the company, after years of research, has fortunately invented a new machine for the fine production of condensed milk to supply the Chinese people. This is indeed a good news that is somewhat encouraging in the midst of national crisis. I was deeply moved and could not refuse. So I packed my bags and went. I was guided to the company and inspected it. I was pleased to learn about the general situation. I have briefly recorded it as follows to inform those who are concerned about the future of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Initially, Xiao Jia Gan, a teacher at Zhejiang Provincial High School, and Xu Kang Zu, a technician at the Zhejiang Construction Bureau, saw that the condensed milk industry was booming in recent years and the demand was increasing daily. Although China had a high need, there were no factories or machines for manufacturing</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case Swindle (Part Two) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>Initially, Peikok befriended Senator Morrow in Mexico City. At that time, Morrow was the US Ambassador to Mexico and the father of Lindbergh's wife. Brigadier General White Birch was an old acquaintance of Colonel Lindbergh. Lindbergh became famous overnight in 1927 by crossing the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, White was the commander of the US warship Memphis. When Lindbergh returned to the United States from Paris, he was a guest aboard the Memphis. Curtis initially worked in shipbuilding, but recently his business had been in decline due to the impact of the global economic depression. When the Lindbergh kidnapping case occurred, Curtis felt that there was a profit to be made. He designed a plan to have Peikok and White Birch act as intermediaries and recommend himself to Lindbergh. Lindbergh believed that all three were well-known members of society. Although he did not know Curtis very well, he did not doubt him because Peikok and White Birch were involved. Who knew that many beasts were clothed in the robes of gentlemen? Curtis's way of making a profit was not through Lindbergh's ransom but through fabricating news facts and holding them as rare commodities. Many newspapers were fooled, and it cannot be said that none of those who participated in the initial planning and encouraged the events were involved. Even a film company, believing that Curtis had discovered many secrets, agreed to give him exclusive rights in advance. Curtis fabricated facts, claiming that the kidnapping was carried out by liquor smugglers in the ocean and that there was a mysterious giant ship anchored near Virginia. If this ship could be found, Lindbergh's son would be easily recovered. Lindbergh even flew his own plane to search the coast of Virginia. The US Navy even dispatched as many as 75 warships to assist Lindbergh's search, but to no avail. Curtis's actions were absurd and ridiculous. Unexpectedly, Lindbergh's child's body was found, and the matter could no longer be kept secret. He confessed to the police. The matter is currently under investigation. It is feared that Curtis will not be able to escape the crime of fraud.</p>
<p>them. The rights and interests were overflowing overseas, exceeding five million yuan annually. Therefore, they immediately exhausted their thoughts and diligently researched for several years and finally invented a condensed milk vacuum machine. The machine has many unique features. The most outstanding of these is that the condenser in the machine is specially constructed and different from those made in other countries. It can completely extract the fishy smell from the milk, so the condensed milk produced is very fresh and delicious and has no fishy smell. Recently, Mr. Xiao and Mr. Zhang Xiongfei jointly established the West Lake Condensed Milk Company. The factory is located outside Qiantangmen in Hangzhou, and the cattle farm is located in Xiyancang, Hai Ning County, with more than 1,000 acres of pasture and 200 dairy cows. The Yan Brand Condensed Milk produced is sold by major pharmacies and food stores. It is expected that its sales will increase daily.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Visiting Grand Mansions, Generals are Often Sent Tumbling; Imprisoned in a Prison of Love, Even Guards can be Devoted Husbands</p>
<p>Now, it's like falling into a fairy land in a dream. There's the burning desire for profit and the intoxication of beautiful blessings. Both wealth and beauty are obtained. Fortune and prosperity are doubly blessed. The luckiest thing in the world, nothing can compare to such completeness. It's almost as if he's already wholeheartedly surrendered to Liang Xiaoyun's skirt, acting as a southern barbarian who will never rebel again. Without her binding him in this way, he's willing to betray others to benefit himself, forgetting Li Wenxia completely. Why bother guarding against so many things? It's better to say it's like newly married love, as sweet as honey. They can't bear to be separated for even a moment. She's eager to return in the car. He's also anxiously waiting for her return at home. It's like a romantic story. Fortunately, the car wheels are working hard. In an instant, they arrived. Liang Xiaoyun hurriedly got out of the car. She looked up and saw that a brand new copper plaque with "安宅" (peaceful residence) on the left sea had been newly hung at the entrance of her house. On both sides were large red-paper-gold-lettered double happiness characters. They seemed to be smiling and welcoming her, the female host. She couldn't help but stop and admire them for a few moments before entering. A servant guarding the gate was standing there with his hands at his side. She immediately asked, "Chang Sheng, where is the master?" Chang Sheng replied, "Sir just arrived not long ago. He's talking with Mr. Wei in the study." Hearing this, her heart became more stable, but she still walked faster. Chang Sheng followed closely beside her and, with his fingers together, roughly covering his lips, whispered solemnly, "After Madam left, no other guests came to the house, and no letters were delivered." Liang Xiaoyun nodded as she walked, indicating that she had heard him. Then she waved her hand behind her, dismissing Chang Sheng, and went straight to the main house, her high heels clattering on the floor. 2 An Yutian and Wei Zhuomou had probably heard her voice. They all got up and walked to the door of the study to greet her. She first saw An Yutian. It was like a long-awaited reunion. Overjoyed, she wanted to rush forward for a sweet embrace. Suddenly, she heard Wei Zhuomou call her "密舍司安"(Mrs. An). She remembered that Wei Zhuomou was here, which was very inconvenient. She quickly canceled her embrace plan and first turned to Wei Zhuomou, saying, "You've been here for a while. You came at just the right time. You can talk to Yutian so he doesn't feel bored at home." As she spoke, the three of them entered the study and sat down separately. Liang Xiaoyun then asked, "What were you talking about just now?" Wei Zhuomou replied, "There's an important matter, and you're also eager to know about it. Li Wenxia asked me to bring back a reply." Liang Xiaoyun was shocked and quickly wanted to ask what Li Wenxia's letter said, what were the details. To be continued in the next chapter.</p>

<h3 id="e201">The PEN Club and the Vegetarian Old Woman <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The world-renowned literary organization "PEN Club" is holding its 10th Congress in Nanjing. The original articles of association stipulated that politics should not be discussed. However, the theme of this congress is "In what ways can PEN Club members assist the peace movement without getting involved in politics?"</p>
<p>What kind of statement is that? Once you assist the peace movement, you are involved in politics. How can you assist the peace movement without getting involved in politics? This is a contradiction.</p>
<p>However, even if the PEN Club gentlemen get involved in politics, their greatest ability is only to write a few articles, send a few peace telegrams, and unleash their brilliant theories. This is just a trick of the黔驢 (donkey from Guizhou), nothing more.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "pen-wielding class" is definitely not as strong as the "gun-wielding class." Facts have already told us this. Let's take two recent examples: (1) During the recent Sino-Japanese war, many members of the League of Nations, after discussing the matter, issued a resolution that Japan tore up with one hand, and the League of Nations could do nothing. (2) During the recent coup in Japan, the military faction formed a non-partisan cabinet, breaking the party cabinet. Ordinary politicians scratched their heads, unable to do anything. Therefore, it is a dream for PEN Club gentlemen to assist the peace movement without getting involved in politics.</p>
<p>Someone might say yes.</p>
<p>The vegetarian old women in our country often chant "Amitabha Buddha, bless the whole family with peace and prosperity and make the descendants flourish." Isn't this an excellent example of a peace movement that doesn't involve politics?</p>
<p>Also, in various countries, when wars break out, Christians often hold large peace prayer meetings. Isn't this another excellent example of a peace movement that doesn't involve politics? PEN Club gentlemen! Why don't you follow this method of peace, neutrality, and mutual non-interference?</p>

<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>The following three small industries have also been successfully tested and have excellent results. The medicines and raw materials used are also cheap, the manufacturing procedures are very simple, and the finished products are also very useful. Readers may want to try them. Not only is it an interesting experiment, but it is also a way to spend your spare time.</p>
<p>(1) Rose Mint Body Powder (Prickly Heat Powder)</p>
<p>Talc Powder (French Made) 7 ounces, Boric Acid 1.5 ounces, Rose Oil (or Fragrance) 10 drops, Peppermint Oil 7 drops (only one fragrance can also be used)</p>
<p>Method: First, place the talc powder and boric acid together in a mortar and grind them until they are very fine. Touch them with your fingers to make sure they are soft and smooth. Then, slowly add the fragrance while stirring. If you want it to be more refined, stir well and then sieve it through a sieve. Store it in a cigarette can (a can with no smoke smell). On hot days, apply it to the skin, which will be exceptionally smooth.</p>
<p>(2) Sealing Wax</p>
<p>White Wax (not Beeswax) 4 ounces, Yellow Wax 2 ounces, Pure Rosin 4 ounces, Carmine a little (or other pigments)</p>
<p>Method: Place the three ingredients together in a rough bowl, melt them over a fire, and then add the coloring agents, stirring vigorously. After cooling, it will solidify. When using, heat it until it melts and pour recorder in a metal mold.</p>
<p>(3) Floral Water</p>
<p>Pure Alcohol 50 parts, Ammonia 3 parts, Essence 3 parts</p>
<p>Method: Mix the above three ingredients together. It is more effective than the products sold on the market. Applying this water after being bitten by an insect can stop itching and disinfect. Prickly heat can also be eliminated by this water. If the essence is peppermint, it will feel more comfortable and cool in the summer.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The impression that the Russian people in Shanghai gave me was not deep, perhaps because I did not pay much attention to them. However, even in the few times I came into contact with them, they had already given me considerable lessons.</p>
<p>A long time ago, one summer, I was at a friend's house in Tiantong'an. Looking down from the balcony, three or five ragged White Russians were begging us. My friends were quite mean. Although they wanted to give them a few coppers, they insisted on getting a considerable reward from them.</p>
<p>"Hey! Dance a dance and I'll give you five coppers."</p>
<p>So they danced desperately, sweating in the dust raised by passing cars. Tearful happiness seemed to overshadow the sorrow of exile. After a duet dance was finished, in addition to the five coppers, they also took half a cigarette I was eating.</p>
<p>This was the first time.</p>
<p>One afternoon near the Great World, I was suddenly grabbed by a barbaric old foreigner. A piece of medicine was rubbed on my clothes. I couldn't help but be stunned. Later, he gestured for me to buy his medicine, and I realized that this was also a trade. It turned out to be an oil stain remover soap. There was no way, so I had to give him a few coppers. But I had no oil stains on my clothes!</p>
<p>This was the second time.</p>
<p>In May of the year before last, many White Russians in Shanghai benefited greatly from the bus strike, and they replaced our Chinese compatriots as bus drivers. But this caused a lot of hatred among people.</p>
<p>Once, I was sitting on a tram on North Sichuan Road. Suddenly, the driver stopped the car and cursed "pig." I saw a White Russian driving a bus past timidly, otherwise, he might have been slapped by the tram driver. In fact, the two had no hatred, but because the White Russian had taken the bus driver's job. (It turns out that the Chinese are still clear about this point!)</p>
<p>This was the third time.</p>
<p>Another day, I was walking with someone who understood Russian.</p>
<p>At a tram stop, a White Russian gentleman was waiting for a tram with a child. Soon the tram stopped nearby. The foreign child pulled his father and ran to the nearby cheap carriages. But he was scolded by his father and finally turned to the first class.</p>
<p>Because my friend told me, I knew what the White Russian gentleman said was ...</p>
<p>"Low-class! Do you want to sit with the filthy workers?"</p>
<p>This was the fourth time.</p>
<p>Ah! This is the once blessed White Russian.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Where Do Airplanes Come From? <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ci Min</p>
<p>"Zhengyang was suddenly captured by the Red Bandits. The ×× division and ×× brigade were sent to encircle and suppress them. One plane from the seventh team departed from ×× to bomb them. ××When the Red Bandits flew a red flag and entered the city in formation, they dropped six or seven bombs."</p>
<p>Before seeing this news, I almost doubted that China had airplanes or bombs!</p>
<p>Currently, suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression are both important national programs for saving the country. Suppressing bandits is certainly important, but resisting foreign aggression cannot be ignored either. Suppressing bandits is the work of internal peace, and resisting foreign aggression is the work of external defense.</p>
<p>Problems such as "prioritizing external defense over internal peace" and "prioritizing internal peace over external defense" do not need to be discussed, but China has airplanes and bombs that can be used to suppress bandits. After reading the above news, we can be sure of this.</p>
<p>Airplanes are called the seventh team. Naturally, there are also the first, second, third ... teams. Moreover, we have no way of knowing whether the seventh team is the last team formed. However, the fact that China has at least seven teams of airplanes is ironclad. Furthermore, airplanes are called teams. We also have no way of knowing how many airplanes there are in each team. However, everyone believes that each team has more than one or two.</p>
<p>Alas! Recalling when our troops were fighting bravely against the Japanese in Shanghai, I don't know where China's many airplanes went. Where did they hide!</p>
<p>Airplanes are not needed for resisting foreign aggression, but they must be used for suppressing bandits. Does this make sense?</p>
<p>An army can say that mountains and rivers are obstacles and it is inconvenient to transfer them, but are airplanes also afraid of mountains and rivers as obstacles?</p>
<p>All of these, all of these, cannot help but raise many questions.</p>
<h3 id="e208">A University Student's Loss <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>In the war zone of Shanghai, several universities have tragically suffered from ruthless artillery fire, leaving them shattered and dilapidated. These venerable institutions of learning have become mere ruins. The universities themselves have undoubtedly suffered, and naturally, their students cannot escape losses either.</p>
<p>One university student, whose most heart-wrenching loss this time wasn't his books or anything of that nature, but rather twenty-one Western suits, six overcoats, and seven pairs of leather shoes. When he returned home for the winter break, he took nothing with him except the clothes on his back. Little did he expect that these prized possessions, separated from him for only a few days, would be gone forever.</p>
<p>The total value of his loss is estimated at around fifteen hundred gold dollars, as each suit averaged about fifty yuan, each overcoat about seventy yuan, and each pair of shoes about twenty yuan.</p>
<p>To a university student who doesn't forget romance while studying, what does a mere fifteen hundred gold dollars worth of clothing mean? As I write this, I can't help but laugh at my own busybodying.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Street Hero <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Chaplin's famous work "Street Hero" (The Big Adventure), which has been playing at the Paris Grand Theatre for several consecutive days, has been extremely well-received by all walks of life in Shanghai. This is because the play is rich in comedic elements, full of interest, and every move of Chaplin is a masterpiece of heartfelt skill. For example, if you want to see an expression of fear and embarrassment, we only need to close our eyes and think, and we will find it difficult to restrain ourselves from laughing. Moreover, seeing it on the screen, it is no wonder that laughter and applause continue incessantly. Today and tomorrow are the last two days, and those who want to see Chaplin's demeanor should reserve seats early, otherwise, it is inevitable to miss out.</p>
<p>Cathay Screens "Emma's History of Hatred" The comedic queen Marie Dressler, who previously starred in films such as "Min and Bill" and "Reducing", has been praised by all. In 1931, she was selected as the Queen of Hollywood. Now, she is starring in another film, originally titled EMMA, translated as "Emma's History of Hatred." Not only is the humor witty and clever, but its sorrowful aspects can also admonish the world and encourage customs. It is indeed a rare masterpiece since the advent of film, and Dressler's reputation has become even higher because of this film. It is heard that the Cathay Grand Theatre on Avenue Joffre has begun screening this film today (Sunday).</p>
<p>"The Truth Revealed" and "Case Within a Case" Shanghai once screened a famous detective film called "The Truth Revealed," originally called Alibi. Today, the "Case Within a Case" opening at the Carlton is also called Alibi, and it also narrates a bizarre and mysterious detective story. Initially, a wealthy widow is murdered, and then a duke, who is in love with the wealthy widow, is suddenly murdered and killed. Suspicions arise, and no one knows who the murderer is. Later, after a famous French detective investigates in various ways, the truth finally comes to light. It turns out that the murderer is a seemingly kind-hearted but ruthless doctor that no one would have guessed. The plot is tense, intriguing, and even more exciting than "The Truth Revealed."</p>
