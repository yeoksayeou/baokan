<p>日本不斷侵略早定步驟</p>
<p>要求國聯迅採有效制裁</p>
<p>顏博士首先道謝行政院之迅速審查李頓報吿書庶大會得以繼續工作顏博士旋謂自九個月前大會休會以還時局似未有重大變遷當時渠曾發言請大會行其能力所可及之各事制止敵對行爲並促令侵略軍隊之撤退及就行政院决議案與盟約精神之範圍内謀取中日爭議之和平解决上述要求係指東三省與上海兩處而言大會以三月十一日所通過之决議案處理此全部問題而對於東三省予以特别注意焉行政院之决議案即大會議案所援引亦即十九特委會產生以執行者載有日本所承認撤兵與不再有何舉動增加時局嚴重之一事今之問題爲日本果已實行其所担任之事乎李頓報吿書第七十七頁載有答語據謂日本仍依照其一定計畫處理東三省之時局實則日本確照其定計應付時局直至東三省連錦州洮南齊齊哈爾在内悉被佔據而後已且自去年九一八以來日軍當局之活動極有政治關係之意味東三省各重要城邑之中國治權悉被消滅而另組民政以代之東三省獨立運動在去年九月以前實未前聞迨日軍佔據其地獨立運動始爲可能發起·組織·與實施者乃若干日本軍民日軍參謀部顯然了解此種獨立運動之作用李頓調查團接各方面之證據亦了解促成「滿州國」者原因有二一爲日軍之臨東三省一爲日本文武官吏之活動是以自前政局不能認爲因眞正獨立運動而得生存者顏博士旋證引九月二十四日行政院議長之宣言内有日本承認「滿洲國」之舉動僅可認爲妨害中日爭議之解决等語顏博士又證引十九特委會主席十月一日對於日本承認「滿洲國」而發之惋惜的言論顏博士繼稱現有可爲之欣慰者李頓調查團在其報吿書中聲明調查團擁護國際重要條約所可適用於中國問題者之原則此種原則包括中國領土與行政完整之不可侵犯此爲國聯盟約第十條與九國公約第一條之事項以爲巴黎非戰公約與國聯盟約所規定以和平方法解决國際困難之義務但渠尤惜李頓報吿書未曾根據所調查之結果在此原則上有更切實之發揮而斷定日本爲毫無可疑之侵略國日本無端開釁實施其决不能視爲合法的自衛之軍事行動日本手造「滿洲國」而正式承認之日本破壞適用於此問題之任何多方面之條約並蔑視國聯之權威謂日本爲侵略國絕無絲毫疑義若李頓報吿書對於此點有正式聲明並囑令日本解散「滿洲國」撤回其軍隊賠償中國人民生命財產之損失則報吿書中之斷論當可有更合理論之結果在調查團心理中此種計畫乃大會所應辦理之計畫故中國現盼望國聯大會之作此計畫也李頓報吿書未曾規定在總解决前將東三省歸還中國之臨時辦法中政府以爲此已爲留交大會辦理之一問題李頓報吿書固尙須有修正成增補之處中政府以爲報吿書中載有充分事實可爲國聯憑以設法處理此問題今請注意李頓報吿書中之結論如下</p>
<p>㈠日人所稱中日懸案三百件已用盡和平解决方法而無效果一說無從徵實㈡九一八夜日軍之行動不能視爲合法自衛之舉動㈢日本雖在日内瓦有所保留然仍繼續依照定計應付滿洲時局㈣日本發起組織並實施「滿洲國」之獨立運動</p>
<p>總觀上述數點日本無端故意用武力與政治陰謀攫取東三省而置國聯權威與國聯盟約非戰公約九國公約於不顧亦顯然可見矣李頓調查團雖有顯明之判詞日本迄未表示接受報吿書所主張原則之願意按調查團所主張者即任何解决必須與此國際工具之條文相適合是也日本所提出根據其五種基本原則開始直接談判之提議旣不能爲中國所接受亦不能爲行政院所承認其簡單理由則以中國或行政院不能接受在軍事威迫下開始談判此事亦無成熟之必要乃日人謂日本此種提議旣未經採用滿洲事件乃繼續進行而成今日莫可挽回之局勢日人此言直謂因行政院未曾採納日本所主張在其軍事壓力下開始中日直接談判之提議日本乃可自由擴大其軍事佔據設立傀儡國而予以承認庶日本可獲有永久維持其軍事佔據之權日本旣已有此種之行動猶佯稱日本不能撤兵今日本之言曰諸君不妨提出任何調解辦法但勿觸及「滿洲國」吾人在此情勢中敢問調解之機會果何在乎顏博士言至此乃追述過去十餘月來中日爭執中之發展謂中政府對於國聯和平機關辦事之遲緩未有何種責言惟國聯辦事之遲緩未使兩造受同樣影響但徒增中國之困苦故渠請求國聯迅速行動渠茲提出請求四點</p>
<p>㈠此次非常大會應宣布日本已破壞國聯盟約·非戰公約·與九國公約</p>
<p>㈡大會應令日本將其軍隊撤至鐵路區域庶解散所謂「滿洲國」政府</p>
<p>㈢大會應根據三月十一日所通過之决議案宣布不承認「滿洲國」政府</p>
<p>㈣大會應定切實之日期而公布之在此可能最低時期内發表依據盟約第十五條第四節最後解决雙方爭議之報吿</p>
<p>顏博士最後聲稱目前中日爭議中之一眞正要點已由李頓爵士說明之李頓爵士之言曰「此次爭議如不依照盟約原則解决之則將不妨害中國之權利且妨害國聯之生存」此語簡明扼要無以復加（六日路透社電）</p>

<p>松岡繼起發言對於李頓報吿所述中國建設之樂觀說明日本與報吿書意見不同之要點謂如此解組之國家决不能從速振興日本對於中國極端忍耐日本雖努力圖謀與中國親善卒因中國之錯誤而失敗日本不欲達到今日之情勢日本所求者僅在條約權利之尊重及日本國民生命財產之安全而已然中國政府恃俄國之援助竟使日本此種努力歸於失敗去歲日本迭次企圖與中國直接談判均未獲得結果即行政院對於此種企圖亦未加以贊助中國方面之反日宣傳日益加甚要知中國在西方之勝利足使東方蒙不幸之影響日本所以不向國聯會申請者則以日本未能期待國聯會之有効保護故也松岡復向當一九二七年時英法美日四國派遣軍隊至上海行政院何以一致贊成彼時固未聞國聯會與中國政府有所抗議即在目今滿洲事件中日本猶未見國聯會有何種方法足與日本以援助此外尤當注意者上海事件與滿洲事件實有重要之區别則以依照條約日本在滿洲本已駐有軍隊故也目前中日爭議之眞實原因乃由於中國之實際狀况與現代中國之期望不能調和之所致至對於「滿洲國」之獨立日本政府不負其責當九一八事件發生之際東京政府並不願滿洲獨立日本政府從未參加獨立運動惟日本人民因四十年以來所焦慮之問題可籍「滿洲國」之成立而獲得解决對於「滿洲國」政府表示同情則誠有之日人固以爲未來之和平當於「滿洲國」求之也松岡復宣言謂「吾人欲得和平吾人以前不欲得滿洲今亦不欲得滿洲但當知日本全國人民均認滿洲爲解决遠東一切問題之關鍵日内瓦方面常聞有人驚呼謂日本在滿洲之行動將促成中國之統一日本對於此種驚呼殊不加以重視蓋日本相信眞正統一之中國將爲和平之中國而非軍人之中國也此際中國之軍隊較全世界任何國爲多中國軍隊最初非因保衛國家而設松岡乃復攻擊中國政府謂中國政府初起時由於俄國之助俾使中國流爲赤化迄至現在仍僅可統治一部分領土蓋共產黨佔據省份其數與政府所統治之省份相等也對於將來之趨勢日本殊不能熟視無睹云松岡繼宣言大會應依下列原則審議滿洲事件即</p>
<p>㈠解决條件必須切實可行並具有立即實現遠東和平之性質　　㈡應設法補救中國之混亂局勢</p>
<p>㈢若由國聯會制定解决程序則應由國聯會負責施行</p>
<p>松岡聲言「對於如此企圖國聯會之會員國中有無一國準備與其他各國合作」松岡認爲滿洲事件未曾發生中國與日本之戰爭亦未發生與其他有關係各國之困難此誠由國聯會干涉所致國聯會可謂已達其高尙目的但在目前情形之下如欲爲中國更進一步之要求實爲過甚之舉要之東方情勢轉移不定未便以之爲準則而使吾人之意志與行爲與之相吻合、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c9">美國之饑民隊乃 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>近數月來擾攘於白宮所在地之華盛頓者始則有歐戰退伍軍人之要索年金風潮譁噪旬日終至流血近日則復有饑民隊之進襲當局戒備森嚴如臨大敵警察曾以淚彈與饑民周旋形勢之嚴重殆爲空前所未有蓋人民爲饑寒所迫自必挻而走險而當局在此人心思亂社會不寗之際加嚴防範增高壓迫亦爲理有固然勢所必至旁觀者或詆爲倒行逆施當局必自謂責無旁貸上下之衝突旣日趨惡化社會革命之危機遂愈見逼切平等自由正義人道之面具旣揭露無遺則大流血大騷亂之慘劇勢亦將隨之而開始矣</p>
<p>目下之世界恐慌爲私有財產制度下生產力膨漲必然之結果故生產力愈大恐慌之嚴重亦愈甚因之此富甲全球生產力占世界第一位之美國所受之影響亦最烈失業人數達一千二百萬之鉅與人口總數一萬二千五百萬比較占十分之一而弱與一九二九年全盛時代工作人數五千萬比較幾合四分之一與世界失業總數二千五百萬人比較幾占半數亦可驚已</p>
<p>恐慌之現象爲生產過剩價格低落之結果農民運麥赴市得値至不足以償運賃遂至相率以麥代薪一面有以麥代薪之農民而一面復有面帶菜色</p>
<p>之饑民其爲不合理距復能加曲護然此用以代薪之麥何以不能移賑饑民乎則因以麥代薪之結果存麥漸稀麥價或可望漲而饑民之施賑則有待於國家及公衆團體之購麥農民自動以麥助賑反適以减少麥之需要復有進者則此經濟恐慌中深創鉅痛之農民亦更無餘力以作此慷慨輸將之義舉也是則其事雖不合於理而在勢則不得不然此亦足見資本主義之發展已達風燭殘年之末葉其制度上無可避免之矛盾樅有任何精徵玄妙之方案而形格勢禁終於無法爲之調和也</p>
<p>否極泰來依經濟史上恐慌循環之先例回復繁榮期在不遠此則美國資產家之所用以自慰而慰人者然據其失業問題專門委員會研究之結果則美國人失業之原因尚多屬於產業合理化以後組織改良機械進步需要勞工日少之結果故樅令產業恢復常態而失業問題則依然無從解决恐慌果能永久偱環乎繁榮果能終於恢復乎已屬絕大疑問而恢復繁榮之後竟猶不能解决失業問題則繁榮云云所以自慰慰人者亦終於自欺欺人而已耳</p>
<p>數十年來國人言富强者往往以美國爲嚆矢迨及近日新式士大夫對於美國之民主政治猶侃侃稱道不置吾人其思之其再思之以如此之理想社會如此之極樂國吾人將猶肓其視聽泯其良知寤寐以求之乎抑將改弦易轍另籌善法乎</p>

<p>丨參閱十二月三日本欄</p>
<p>呂裕如君訊第㈠「物極必反」「蜜多了不甜」，用情過度·自難免一時的裂痕，而由戀愛之幻影結合者，其由沸點降到零度，更屬必然。第㈡未實行結婚的須先詳细考察對方，已結婚的應互相尊敬，眞摰誠信，愛而不褻，敬而不畏，庶能常相融洽。</p>
<p>買滋棻君訊第㈠是由於「物極必反」的物理，和「結婚是戀愛的墳墓」的心理。第㈡在結婚之前，應節制愛情的熱度，不要使它達到沸點，旣結婚之後，須設法保持原來的愛情，如時常别</p>
<p>離或同伴旅行等。</p>
<p>朱紹文君訊第㈠因爲人類惰性與貪性發展的結果。第㈡須拿忠字與恕字去補救。</p>
<p>周國驊君訊第㈠由於靈與肉二者之間缺少了一樣搆成「愛」的原素，第㈡（甲）互相敬愛信賴，（乙）使經濟寛裕，（丙）能共甘苦，（丁）以理智自持，（戊）分睡，（已）有活潑的子女，</p>
<p>景眞君訊第㈠由於誤解自由或舊式家庭的壓迫，第㈡要上自政府下至司法官員學校敎師，家庭父兄，敎導靑年以夫妻互諒互助的眞義，甘苦與共。彥雲君訊第㈠根源於剝削社會之下的經濟現象所造成，這只是整個社會問題的一枝節。第㈡須澈底變革社會制度，一切唯心的方法都是不中用的。謝心吾君訊第㈠（甲）結婚前彼此都掩飾弱點，結婚後一切的弱點都暴露出來，（乙）婚後的生活與婚前的理想相逕庭。第㈡互相諒解，把其他的夫婦（不如我的）作比較，業餘，夫婦消遣須求其學術化，使生活不太平凡。張少良君訊第㈠或由於經濟逼迫，或由於某一方面之無人格。第㈡須平時量入爲出，并注重人格修養。</p>
<p>金明昌君訊第㈠由於婚前太自由，婚後則太不自由及雙方於婚前都沒有充分的考察。第㈡交友至訂婚時間須長，雙方須開誠佈公，互諒互助，或游園旅行等。</p>

<p>葛傳槼君訊一，貴報說「一切問題與難疑都不是個人的」，我以爲只能說「不都是個人的」，却不能說「都不是個人的」，而且那些「不是個人的」問題和疑難固屬重要，那「是個人的」問題和疑難，對於那提出這個問題或疑難的人，格外重要「讀者顧問」也應該爲它解答，例如拿「簡則」裏所說的自然科學而論，倘若有人提出一個關於化學或物理的問題或疑問，它未必是一般讀者所要知道，但那發問的人是十分重視它的）。二，貴報旣聘了幾位專家，似乎應該把他們的姓名發表出來，至少在每個答復之下應該說明這是那位專家答的，這樣似乎鄭重些，而且各專家旣有負責的答復，讀者也似乎高興些。三，劉君說「不至流爲算術難題三百解答之類，」當，然那算術專家沒有這許多工夫來替一個讀者解答三百個難題，但是我以爲倘若有人請求解答算術難題，那算術專家，就該負責的爲他解答，我以爲替讀者解答「特殊的問題，（例如某　某算術題怎樣解法，或某時代某國的某事實情怎樣，）比較答復許多籭統的問題，（例如怎樣修學，或怎樣服務社會，）較爲重要，同時也較爲困難，好在旣有專家，只須各專其所專，就容易了。四，貴報主張把重要些的問題提交大衆討論，然後由貴報綜合意見，做一個結論，我以爲有許多問題並不是「意見」的問題，例如算術上的難題總該先由那算術專家研究，倘若他也研究不出，然後登在報上，請求全國算術家研究。</p>
<p>覆：承葛君指示，極感丨但有不敢苟同者，謹覆如下：㈠「一切問題與疑難不是某個人的」的理由，已見一日刋登的本欄緣起中，而且如葛君所舉的「關於化學或物理之疑難」的例，尤其很顯明的此種學術上的疑，難非個人所能獨有。㈡公開專家姓名，當然可以，但無必要。㈢劉廷芳先生函中所言「不至流爲開術難題三百解答之類」一句，原意是希望本欄潑潑的園地，不致流爲賬簿式的死板的荒土，「算術難題三百解答」是譬喩的話。㈣並不是每一個問題都提出討論，提出討論的只是一些比較重要的問題，算術難題自然是交由專家解答。</p>

<p>㈩㈠第一二學年兒童的力量有限應注意工作的過程不要苛求優良的成績</p>
<p>㈩㈡第三四學年應充分使兒童用自已的力量以滿足自已的需要工作法工具管理修理及使用法的指導是必須注重的</p>
<p>㈩㈢第五六學年固然應促兒童嚴密應用工作法以求成績優良但工作的經濟的過程機巧的創造力仍比優良的成績爲尤要</p>

<p>（前江蘇省國術館訓育主任兼　輯）</p>
<p>— 金一明</p>
<p>㈢擊劍</p>
<p>「擊劍」係以劍相擊刺之術也漢書司馬相如　相如　讀書學「擊劍」迈代謂用刀相　　　「劈刺」吳越春秋載越女見越王「越王」曰夫劍之道則如之何女曰妾生於深林之中長於無人之野無道不習不　諸侯竊好擊之道誦之不休妾非受於人也而忽自有之越王曰其道如何女曰其道甚微而易其意幽而深凡手戰之道「内實精神外示安儀」「見之如好掃奪之如懼虎」一人當百百人當萬斯言深得「擊劍」之奥旨由此可知吾國「擊劍」之由來久矣</p>
<p>莊子說劍篇論爲劍之道謂須「示之以虚開之以利」「後之以發先之以至」言簡而意賅深人肯綮荊軻傳謂　勾踐聞荊軻刺秦王不中私曰嗟乎惜哉其不講於刺劍之術也是昔時擊劍之術已造幽深若荊卿者尚謂不講刺劍之術謂後世上子琴劍書箱能撫琴無不能擊劍魏文帝典論自序云子幼時學「擊劍」閱師多矣四方之法唯京師爲最善同時劉先生亦善「擊劍」明何良臣陣紀云　莊子之紛紋法王之起落治劉先生之　應法黑明王之閃電法馬起之出手法其五家之劍庸或有傳於是知明代「擊劍」之士精者已不多　是以何良臣有感而云所云五家之劍當亦有所本也戚繼光紀效新書所附載之「劍經」係轉錄俞大猷所著大猷曾從李良欽學擊「荊楚長劍」故其劍經中所述之理將劍法而　爲棍法且云棍法如四書刀槍如六經若能棍則各刺器之法從此得矣余以拳法比爲字塊而以棍刀槍劍比爲讀本尤以劍具雙鋒爲四者中之尤難者也至於劍之長短尺寸余見考　記言之頗詳刀劍錄載歷代年號及所　之劍名亦一一可考此二書舊書坊中間亦見之</p>
<p>㈣刺槍</p>
<p>績文獻通考謂使槍之家十七使法各有不同槍法亦各有異楊家二十六路花槍曰馬家槍曰　家槍曰張飛槍曰五顯神槍曰拐突槍曰拐刄槍曰梭槍曰槌槍曰人寗筆槍曰拒馬槍曰　突槍曰　嵋槍曰沙家十八下曰倒手杆子曰　金鏢曰地舌槍共十七種五代史王彥章傳彥章爲人驍勇有力能跣足　棘行百步持一鐵槍騎而駛突奮疾如飛而他人莫能擊也軍中號爲王鐵槍宋史李全傳全以弓馬趫捷能運鐖槍時號李鐵槍妻　氏謂鄭衍德曰二十年梨花槍天下無敵其後明戚繼光敎練兵卒於楊家槍法取精去滓多所採巾長槍總說云夫長槍之法始於楊氏謂之曰梨花天下咸尙之其妙在於熟之而已「熟則心能忘手手能忘槍圓神而不滯又莫貴於靜也」靜則心不妄動而處之裕如變幻莫測神化無窮」今之行於世者卒皆沙家馬家之法益沙家竿子馬家長槍各有其妙而有長短之異其用帷楊家之法有虚實有奇正其進銳其退速其勢險其節短不動如山岳動如雷霆故曰二十年梨花槍天下無敵手陣紀楊氏梨花槍較　家槍沙家竿李家短槍爲優然戚東牟謂爲施之於行陣則又不同其意則以大陣當前强切不得先弱切不得後使槍之時法欲簡而立欲疎非簡無以能分糾非疎無以瞻挪進退此爲槍法用於昔日爭塲之主力也</p>
<p>今中央國術採取「剌槍」爲大槍爲「劈剌」尙不可知惟槍爲兵器之主槍法云「你槍扎我槍擊你槍不動我槍發槍是　腰鎖先扎手和脚高不扎旁不救中不怕虚槍一點難抬架你繞我也繞則怕手遲了去如箭來如綫指人喉縐人面扎人還不見</p>
<p>傅傳儒師曾吿余歌决云「辰時使槍日在東占往東方奸用攻午時使槍日在南休敎太陽迎雙　酉時使槍日晨西占往西方見高低六月使槍須避日臘月使槍要須風謹述所知如此願國術同志進而敎之</p>

<p>洋麥之位年來洋麥輪入額之巨大已占進口貨中甚重要之地位位次於米價値億萬國内麥產之衰落固無可諱言而海外產麥國家之奬勵生產遂致產額澎脹不得不用傾銷之方法我國關稅壁壘單薄歷受外來經濟侵略任其自由競爭漫無限制返顧麥產又衰退至不可以數計最近各廠若無洋麥進口勢必全體停機嚴重狀態已可槪見良以主要農產之省分或被兵匪之禍或被水旱之災更甚者受不良政治</p>
<p>之壓迫膏腴良田改植驚粟農時旣失生產更少回憶民元時祇四川一省</p>
<p>到申之小麥約有三四十萬之巨彼時上海粉廠正在發軔麥廉粉貴得造成勃興之局面嗣復河南（最多）湖北兩省麥產集中漢口絡繹來申皖北一帶旣爲麥產之豐饒之區又大都以上海爲尾閭寗知二十年之後四川無論矣</p>
<p>卽漢口麥亦幾絕跡皖麥由運河長江來者亦不及民十以前之暢旺積此種種本埠之製粉廠除新麥時期尙足應付外否則卽須仰給于洋麥時至今日竟形成非洋麥進口不能維持之惶恐此種民食之危機非用極大之良善政治恐難解决之道</p>
<p>定價之計算　定購洋麥手續頗爲簡單計算亦絕方便卽以經手洋商所得國外報價及當日匯價折合爲規元之數如果兩方接近卽可成交訂定購美麥及坎拿大麥該麥爲一號至五號定購以二號至三號爲大宗國外市價以每一噸（卽二千磅）（合十五担）爲單位假定美麥每噸報價爲十七美金（連水脚佣金上海交貨始以三十美金之匯兌折合上海規元爲五十六兩六錢六分以十五担相除卽得每担三兩七錢八分上海規元）如定坎拿大麥亦用此法惟坎麥與美麥訂定時所不同者美麥以二千磅爲一噸坎麥則以二千二百四十磅爲一噸（卽十六担八十斤）至澳洲各埠小麥訂購時不分號數而以每一蒲式耳（英　器）之重量爲標準普通貨以六十磅有次至五十八磅高至六十二磅當訂購時雙方指定一種磅額定單載明若貨到遇有分量不足有公定規例眨其價格其計算方法假定每一英　（二千二百四十磅）爲五磅四先令六便士合一千二百五十四便士假定以一先令九便士之匯兌價卽合上海規元五十九兩七錢一分以十六担八十斤相除卽得三兩五錢五分零（每担價）若言芝加哥坎拿大洋麥之期貨報價業中人大致以三三三計算而于三三三原理多莫明其妙須知三三三者卽三十三　三蒲式耳（第一蒲式耳六十磅適合二千磅）　此係期貨標凖價格與現貨性質不同因現貨定價與標準常不相符不過爲業中人明瞭一種趨勢而已（待續）</p>

<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>一天下午，我去訪問一個當代有名的畫家一S君。</p>
<p>那個畫家正伏在他的桌上工作着，看見我去</p>
<p>了，並沒有放下他的筆，可是他的嘴却在應酬着我。他講了許多關於繪畫的故事，我是不懂得藝術的，所以只是沈默着聽他的講話。他偶然提到所謂藝術的天才，我一向是不相信一切的天才的。所以略如反駁，這個畫家便放下了他的筆，開始嚴重地和我討論起天才的問題來了</p>
<p>他的論證始終不能使我信服，因爲我是一個絕對不輕於放棄我自已的主張的人。</p>
<p>最後逼得S君露着輕蔑的眼光，開始講出一，</p>
<p>篇故事來。</p>
<p>一從前有個畫家，丨（述說這故事的人曾講出一個很熟識的名字，可惜我忘記了），│他開始說是最善於畫美人的。但他的作品很難得到</p>
<p>「有一天，一個權勢者開了一次盛大的宴會，約請了無數當代的文人和藝術家，這個畫家當然也受到約請了。</p>
<p>「到了約定的時間，他來了，酒席之間，談了許多文人或繪畫的轶事，講到當代，大家齊聲都讚頌他畫美人的手筆於是這個畫家在得意的扮圍中，多喝了幾杯酒，已經有些醉意了</p>
<p>席散後，主人提議要留一個紀念，請在場的文人畫家各人顯一顯自已的手筆，有的　了，有的畫了，最後輪到他來畫美人；可是他醉了，　彙彙地；朦朧地聽着周圍的人們的讚頌，他有些恐懼了，他怕在醉酒之下，畫不出精心傑構的作品。</p>
<p>「人們催請着他，他仍在猶豫；最後，手顫抖着，拿起了畫筆，他開始在展好了的白紙上畫着一個少婦的面孔的綸廓。朦朦的眼，顫抖的手，都不能如意，他心中有些怒惱子，他憎惡那周圍逼他下筆的人。</p>
<p>「面孔畫完，他不願再畫下去，現在那白紙上的少婦的臉，由他的醉眼看來，是絲毫沒有生氣的，他的怒惱移到這個畫中的人上去了。</p>
<p>他心裏想，這個少婦的面孔的存在，是會毁壞他的聲譽的，他更激怒了。</p>
<p>「再拿起畫筆，他抺了濃墨，對着那個面孔上，就是刷刷的兩點，他好像發狂似地，在大衆的呆然的眼光下，揚長走開了。</p>
<p>「一夜，這個畫家沒有安眠，懊侮　苦着他的心，他甚至想，以後再也不動筆了。</p>
<p>「第二天的淸晨，他正在床上苦痛地輾轉着的時候，他聽見了屋外的糟雜的人聲，他從床上被朋友們拉了起來。</p>
<p>「原來他的朋友是特意來慶賀他昨夜的成功的昨夜，人他發狂似地逃走後，人們並不理解他的心情，驚呆了一陣，又把眼一齊轉到那副少婦的面孔上，這時他們發現了一種奇蹟，他在憤怒中想毁壞那面孔的刷刷的兩筆濃墨，顯在那少婦的雙頰上，正似兩朶濃厚的胭脂，而這兩朶胭脂使那副面孔更覺得活現了，超過了他以前一切美人圖的成績。</p>
<p>「從這次以後，這個畫家，在善畫美人的聲譽之外，又加一了善畫胭脂的名聲。」</p>
<p>Ｓ君講到這經，把他的故事收束了。他更論證地說：</p>
<p>「你還不相信有所謂藝術的天才麽？你一定解釋這故事是偶然的，是的，的確它是偶然的，但這種偶然爲什麽只能出現在那個畫家的手上呢？」</p>
<p>我呆呆地吸着一支烟，我沒有話回答他。</p>
<p>一九三五年十一月卅日</p>
<h3 id="c217">自由 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 行</p>
<p>「自由」，在這世間，據說是確有其物。但畢竟其爲物也太玄隶妙，朦朦地，糢糊地，像一溜靑烟，又像一甜夢，你一伸手，烟便從你的手邊消散，夢也就從你的記憶裏幻滅，手裏空空，什麽都沒有捉住。所以，一直到現在，「自由」還只是一條淡淡的影，若有，又若無。</p>
<p>然而，世界上儘有聰明人，偶然，一隻鳶飛上天空，一條魚躍出水面，聰明人便若有所得的喊出··「你看，自由，就在這裏，就活躍在這活潑的天機裏。」而更聰明的人則是更斬釘截鐵的說呌：「不自由，毌寗死</p>
<p>但談到死，究竟並沒有「鳶飛」與「魚躍」那麽容易。有時候，你要死，偏不准你死。正如你要活，偏不准你活一樣。「不准你活」，眼前很不難隨便提出一個實證，這　不必細談，而上海黃浦江畔至南京燕子磯上，聽說都竪有一塊「死不得」的石碑，而自殺據說也是犯了什麽法第幾百幾十幾條，哼！你以爲死可以自由嗎？</p>
<p>就是海那樣闊，天那樣空，但鳶和魚也還是不得不隨時留意。因爲芸芸萬彙，究竟有「强」「弱」之分，强者可以隨意在海面天空打下一個籬笆，不准你飛，不准你躍，你要任意一點，就會極輕便鑽佈好了的網羅！</p>
<p>所以在秦始皇帝時代，就沒有人敢「偶語，」也沒有人敢「藏書」，都把自已下死力的壓，壓得扁扁地，裝在一個得進不得出的壁縫裏，因有沒爲人肯伸手去捉捉不住的烟，而死也到底有點可怕。</p>
<p>但，始皇帝的網終於被壁縫裏的人撞破了。這裏，雖說並沒有眞的捉住「自由」，但，假使壁縫裏的人再撞破幾面網，也許一伸手，不會永永是空空的罷！</p>
<h3 id="c218">蘇俄的幼稚園 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 克多</p>
<p>蘇俄的幼稚園，分有許多民族組，如韃靼，哥薩克，烏克蘭，葛羅仁等民族，都有特别的風俗習慣，所以兒童敎育，必須特别訓練，使成人以後，文化敎育能夠致。有疾病的兒童，如殘廢畸形等，都另行编組，施以適當的敎育，便於矯正。此外有普通的兒童組。各組又分成日夜二班，家長做日工的，則早晨將兒童送入園内，晚上領出；做夜工的，晚上送入園内，夜半領回。每組有半敎師性質的看護兩人，專門照顧他們。</p>
<p>兒童入園時，先由看護檢視，是否淸潔。不淸潔的兒童，就呌他到洗臉室去自已洗濯，年紀小的，則有看護帮助他們。每個兒童都有自已洗臉的用具，如面由肥皂牙刷牙粉等類。各人在洗臉完結以後，將面由等物，放在一尺高的櫉内，什麽東西放什麽地方，都有一定，秩序整然，毫不紊亂。飯廳内，有專門爲小孩用的椅子和桌子，小孩自已都能拿得動；盆碟，匙子，茶杯等，統是很小的。每桌有一班長，是小孩自已選舉出來的。吃飯喝茶時，都聽班長的指揮和看護照料，絕少有爭吃的一情。俱樂部内的裝置。與遊戲室差不多，但規模比較大一些；壁上所掛的圖畫，很有規則，中間總懸一　列事的遺像，和蘇俄的名人如斯大林，莫洛託失等的照片，以及其他適合於兒童的標語，如「打倒家庭廚房」，「幼時做玩具，大時造汽車」，「帮助家長建設社會主義」，「五年計畫四年完成」等等。</p>
<p>有一種專門爲兒童自已使用的藥品室，室内放有碘酒，硼酸膏，綳布，棉花，橡布膏之類。如兒童有些小的微傷時，由别的兒童代他敷藥綳紮</p>
<p>此外並有許多小工塲，如　工，木工工</p>
<p>，漆工，翻沙等。各種器具，也是特别製造的，由兒童的意志，隨便工作。並有飛機，汽車等模型，放在陳列室内，也由他們任意取玩。運動塲設在露天，有種種兒童運動的器具。寢室的設備，與嬰兒院相差不多，不過床是木製的，設有欄杆，每一個寢室睡幾個人，由醫生檢視房子面積的大小而决定。年紀大的兒童，起床時必須自已整理被褥，音樂室内，放有許多兒童使用的各種樂器，讓他們自已高興玩那種樂器，看護不去阻止。</p>
<p>兒童日常生活的秩序，是這樣··七時半起床（不住宿在園内的兒童，從七時半到八時爲入園時間），八時洗臉，八時半呼早飯，九時工作。照年齡的大小，而規定工作的種類。工作時間，爲四十分鐘。十時到花園中去散步，或到運動塲去做各種遊戲。十一時回園，十二時吃中飯與洗臉。十二時半爲晝寢時間，二時半起床，三時工作，四時吃點心，四時以後爲遊戲時間。七時三十分鐘回家，冬春兩季較早些。八時吃晚飯。園内的設備與佈置，都是很完美的。有兒童敎育專家主持園内事務，並時常與兒童的家長會議與談話，怎樣改善兒童敎育的方法。監督幼稚園的是地方敎育委員會。有時候由園中的職員率領兒童到附近的工廠，作坊，農場，或博物館中去參觀。</p>
<p>幼稚園的經費，大半由國家負擔兒童的家長，僅繳納一小部的錢，或家境艱難的，就完全免費。</p>
<p>各幼稚園中間，還訂立合同，互相競賽；將那些優良的地方，在報紙上發表，吸引未入園的兒童。</p>
<p>幼稚園的小孩，自三歲到八歲。八歲以上的，送入小學校。</p>

<h3 id="c219">才能的遺傳 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 聲</p>
<p>人的才能有許多是由遺傳得來的。例如音樂的天才多從幼小的時候就表現出來了。這無疑的是由於天賦的遺傳。德國作曲家巴哈氏（ＪohannＳeba～tionＢachl685-l750)當二十二歲時，他的音樂才能已經達到了圓熟之境。悲多紋十三歲，孟德爾孫ＬucＷigＦelixl8０９－１８４７十五歲時，都發表了他們的作曲。又　　奥國的作曲家莫茶持（ＷolfgangＡmadeusＣ</p>
<p>hryotonＤＭozart1756-1791)在五歲的時候，卽能作曲。</p>
<p>查巴哈氏之家系除產生二十個著名音樂家以外，尙產生四十餘個普通音樂家。這不能不歸因於遺傳性了。</p>
<p>關於音樂的才能之正確的遺傳，至今還沒有完全正確的研究。據哈斯特的研究，謂音樂的遺傳因子是劣性的，而非優性的。總合研究多數家系的結果，其遺傳情形如下。</p>
<p>㈠若父母雙方都具有音樂的特别才能，（不問是聲樂或器樂）那麽兒女中有具特别音樂才能的，也有具普通音樂才能的。</p>
<p>㈡若父母都沒有音樂才能，同時祖父母（一方或雙方）同樣缺乏音樂才能時，那麽兒女全部都沒有音樂才能。</p>
<p>㈢父或母一方有特别的音樂才能，其他一方的音樂才能尋常者，則其兒女的音樂才能，有持優的，有普通的，有全沒有的，種種不一。</p>

<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>現在世界上的大輪船在四萬噸以上的有八艘。其中最長的是英國的馬傑斯漆克號，長九一五呎五吋，自首至尾，全長爲九五四呎六吋。這艘船原爲德國的俾斯麥號，大戰的結果，乃爲英國的有。</p>
<p>若以噸數計算，那末要推美國的列威耶贊號爲最大，該船有五九，九五七噸。這原來是德國的法達蘭德號，戰後乃歸美國所有。計長九五○呎，自龍骨至甲板高一○四呎，吃水量三九，五呎，排水量六四，七○○○可載旅客三，四○○人，船上職員爲一，一八三人。速力二四，馬力一○○，○○○。載重約九，三○○噸。船内的走道約二哩半。電燈數一五，○○○，電綫長度達五哩。炳囱直經爲三二呎。速力佔第一位的大船是德國的布列孟號與奥依羅巴號。這兩隻船的速力，原計畫爲二十七節，及至實騐時，兩船平均速力爲二十八節以上。全長九三八呎五吋，幅寛一○一呎八吋。高九十七呎五吋，吃水量三三呎七，五吋，馬力九二，五○○，乘客二，二○○人，職員水手共爲九六○人。</p>
<p>製造這兩隻船的目的，本來在和英國競爭，用以橫斷大西洋的。前者橫斷大西洋需時四日十七小時四十二分，後者四日十七小時六分。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>海泉只得又折回來，坐在客堂的一隅。他看見雜役端了一簍兒乾柴片和一小鉛桶的白煤，走到火爐傍邊來。</p>
<p>「少奶奶吩咐了，今天天氣冷，怕你從南邊來的人受不了，要生火爐。······」海泉並不覺行怎樣冷，但也不去攔阻他。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>任碩士夫妻的寢室裏的窗帘，還緊緊地掩覆着，一絲的陽光也透不進來。從天花板正中吊下來大電燈上，也加上了一個淺藍色的紗罩，發射出一種像深秋的月色的幽光。雪白的絲質的蚊帳仍然低覆他們的寢榻。當媽子送名片進來時，就聽見他夫妻倆在帳裏調情的笑聲和私語。</p>
<p>『那天說的林先生來了』。</p>
<p>『好的，請他在下面多坐一刻。我們就起來了』</p>
<p>媽子出去了後，佩珍掙扎着要起來，但是任碩士故意阻着她。</p>
<p>『算了吧。快要十二點了。』</p>
<p>她從帳裏鑽出來了，貼身穿的是淺桃色的絨質睡衣，和長僅及膝的靑包綢褲。她走到橢圓形的鏡臺前，望了望　她的剛從夢中醒來的睡顏，有沒有不便給丈夫以外的男性看見的缺點。她一邊望自自已的臉兒，一邊梳頭上的亂髮。她聞着了自已的髮香了。她想，這正是丈夫愛她的一個特徵。</p>
<p>她開始洗漱了，足足花了有三十多分鐘才洗漱完了。這時候，她的丈夫任錦華也起身了，走進化妝室裏來。他看見偑珍在化妝鏡臺前凝神靜氣的化妝，不覺呆呆的站在她的身後，偷望鏡裏面的她。</p>
<p>『看什麽？還不認得人麽？』</p>
<p>她頓了頓足嬌嗔着說。</p>
<p>『今天更好看了。莫非，······』</p>
<p>錦華笑着把化妝臺上的牙刷拿了過來，檢Ｃolgate牙膏。</p>
<p>『又瞎了······』</p>
<p>她把頭向後一伸，全身便靠到他的胸膛上來了。</p>
<p>『快走開去不准你在這裏』</p>
<p>她再撒嬌般的說。不理她，還是儘笑着望鏡裏面。</p>
<p>『别閙了下面有客呢。呌他儘等怎麽好呢？。</p>
<p>她到後來，才歛了笑容，正經地對他說。</p>
<p>『聽說你的妹妹滿歡喜他，一定是個美男子吧。你想快看他去，是不是？所』</p>
<p>以急得那個樣子的。』</p>
<p>他說着才鬆了手，讓她繼續她的化妝。</p>
<p>又過了一會，她化妝好了，便走回房裏來，換穿衣服。她揀了一件顏色最艶的格子花的嗶嘰旗袍，和她最喜歡的一雙黑漆皮高跟跳舞鞋。</p>

<h3 id="c222">女人 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>别人家時常在談論女人，我想女人果有一談之價値，前幾天有在報章上說，法國女人如何克苦勤儉，有人說日本女人如何愛國，組織娘子護國團，有人說德國女人在社會上如何爭得了地位，這些話都是眞的，法國女人雖然愛搽脂抺粉，但據久居其地的人說，法國女子之中，至少有百分之六七十是能自食其力，因爲大戰之後，女子過剩（這裏，姑且借這兩個字來用一用，）尤其是男人們在選擇配偶的時候，他們擇偶的第一個條件是，這個女人是不是能自食其力，</p>
<p>所以一般女子，在處女時代，就學好了一樣職業，否則是不容易找到丈夫的，在德國女子之中，可以說百分之九十以上都能自食其力，回顧我國女子，眞是望　莫及，一般所謂受過敎育的摩登女子，少女時代以讀書爲裝飾，以奢侈爲榮耀，出入電影院，跳舞塲，交際塲所，自以爲名媛，到了二十多歲，便戀上了一個富翁，或者聲勢浩大的貴人們，做了名人的太太，大過其皇后妃子的闊生活，</p>
<p>在男人方面，不論窮富，擇偶的時候總以面貎的美醜爲第一條件，只要是個如花如玉的姑娘，娶了過來，就是自已淪爲牛馬，也是甘之如飴，這種現象養成了女人依賴丈夫的劣根性，她們憑着自已的一副漂亮面孔，是不怕沒有富人郎找她的，</p>
<p>男人啊，你們都想有一個女人吧？而且想有一個所謂摩登小姐來做你的女人吧？在你沒有嘗着她的滋味的時候，你是多　熱烈的渴求着啊，可是，我得吿訴您，當您有了她之後，您將添上了不少煩惱，如果您是一個有點志氣，想在世上做一番事業的人，那可糟糕，她的一筆生活費就夠累得您頭晕腦漲，</p>
<p>終日呌苦了，</p>
<p>養了嬌妻，而不想去做官撈大財，括民脂民膏的，眞算是天字第一號「屈死」，其下者，爲了嬌妻美妾，大做其貪官汚吏，當今之天下，袞袞者流，以至於敎書匠，編書匠，商店店員，走夫販卒，其不爲女人之奴隷，亦稀矣，烏乎女人丨然而，女人之壞，壞在男人，今日全國之男子，應該下緊急總動員令，自今日今時起，無論美醜，凡是不能自食其力的女人，一槪不要她做老婆，這樣一來，也許男子們有些生路，而所謂摩登女子也者，亦不敢再撒嬌痴，度其浪漫之生活了，</p>

<h3 id="c223">電車 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 陶小桃</p>
<p>電東行動又快，又方便，又省錢，所以普通人都喜歡乘牠。我們旣然時常乘牠；牠的道理我們怎能不知道呢？我現在把幾種電車的原理介紹在下面：㈠有軌電車</p>
<p>在發電塲中設發電機，發電機轉動，橫截磁力線，發也電流，由正極出↓</p>
<p>街上的架空綫↓電車上面的極棒↓起動箱（即開車人面前的鐵箱）由起動箱↓車底的直流電動機↓車輪而至鐵軌回到發電場發電機的負極。當電流至電動機時，電動機即轉動車輪，車便能前進了。</p>
<p>那麽怎樣能使車走快和走慢呢這是全靠着那起動箱的作用。　可以節制由發電機來的電流，使牠多少合度，以定快慢。在起動箱中，安着金屬條，有的阻力大，有的阻力小。你要電流弱一些的時候，只須使這有大阻力的金屬條與電路連接，電流就弱了。你要電流强一些的時候，只須使小阻力的金屬條與電路連接，電流就强了。假若你要停的話，只須使金屬條不與電路連接，將電動機接不着電流就停了。司機者用手把箱上的木柄轉動，便是節制電流的意思假若要車倒走的話，只可轉動大柄旁邊之小柄。這一轉可使有相反方向的電流流入電動機，使車倒走。</p>
<p>㈡無軌電車</p>
<p>無軌的電車，初看很是危奇。我們或者要懷疑，怎麽，沒有電流的回路而可以行走？可是你再細細的看一看有軌電車和無軌電車的區别，就以我找着牠們的道理來。有軌電車有個極棒和一條架空綫；無軌電車有兩個極棒，牠的項上有兩根架空綫。牠那根極棒，有一根是等於鐵的軌道的作用。當電流由一根架空綫上入了一根極棒，至電動機，而由另一根極棒，另一根架空線回到發電機。</p>
<p>有時候電車不要架空線，面使電　藏在軌道的溝中，這種電車的裝置我國還沒有，雖然在表面上要美觀些，可是價錢就貴得多了。</p>

<p>回想到六年前的時候，我在m校讀書，同學們談笑，總離不了這「戀愛」兩字，研究探討，好似有無限的興味，而尤以同班Ｓ女士的談鋒最健，可算是我們m校中戀愛的指導者了，那時我祇有十五歲，懂得什麽戀愛，當然我須得去問那指導者的Ｓ女士！請求她吿訴我，這戀愛的意義，但是她好像不願意詳細地答覆我，這時候她的面孔漲得很紅，低下了頭，等了好久，乃說道：你到了相當的年齡，自然有明白的一天，奇了，她怎麽，將這戀愛二字看得這樣的神秘，而難道我沒有談戀愛的資格嗎？</p>
<p>記得有一天的晚上，我和弟弟在Ｖ公園内散步，將要走過一株大樹的當兒，忽然有男女談笑的聲音，冲入我的耳鼓，這並不是什麽危奇的事，但是我覺得女子的聲音很熟，再仔細聽，原來Ｓ女士呀！這時引起我好奇的衝動，哈哈，她倆怎麽在這月兒被樹影遮住怪黑暗的所在談笑呢？是了，大約她又在講什麽戀愛吧，我就輕輕底走向大樹的背後，立着聆敎她倆所說的一切「蜜司Ｓ放心吧，我决不抛棄你，家庭方面有我疏通的辦法，你若是不相信，立刻可以掉換戒子，以作訂婚記念」，「是呀那我很相信你的，你祇要有永久愛我的决心，當然我也可使那頑固的家庭答應你的要求」在寂靜的空氣中，那倆個黑影，好似在那裏掉換紀念物，我正在不明白，她倆所講的是什麽意思，而還想再聽她倆講下去，但是那身傍的小弟弟已在牽我的衣角，表示他已是要回家的樣兒，我恐怕破她倆覺察，所以只得躡𫐢地走開。</p>
<p>第二天的早晨在校中，將昨夜所見的一切，吿訴給我的知友Ｗ女士，並且要求她答覆我Ｓ女士和一個男子會談，究是甚麽意義，她微微的笑了，同時她似電樣的目光從眼角上斜視着我，她又將手指在我的額上一點，嘲笑似的說「小妮子裝什麽道學假痴假呆，Ｓ女士的事，你去問她就能明白，我是不曉得呀！但她旣有了這秘密的戀愛，我得去請她公開一說着她拉了我的手，一同跑到Ｓ女士的宿舍，正在伏案作書的Ｓ女士，見了我們笑迷迷的跑進去，好似有點驚慌的神情，她急忙將她案頭所寫的一頁緋紅色的西式信箋，向抽屜中亂塞，但是不久仍回復她原有的狀態，不過還帶着勉强鎭定似的色彩，Ｗ女士見她這種樣子，已曉得了，她的用意，問着她說道：Ｓ女士寫情書怎麽這樣的偷偷摸摸呢？Ｓ女士她那肯不申辯呢？接着？說道：不要瞎寃枉人啊我是找不出什麽情人，恐怕　自已在想吧，Ｗ女士指指我說道：你問問她吧，誰有情人，你昨夜在Ｖ公園内的事，難道已忘了嗎？哈哈，有證人在這裏，你還抵賴作甚呢？老實說罷，這時的Ｓ女士面孔上倐紅倐白，先前那種强項如鐵的神情，此刻已無形的消滅，反表現着扭扭妮妮的態度，而一言不發的，注視着我們在這寂寞而緊張的空氣中，我不覺引起了舊時的疑問鼓着勇氣的問她道：Ｓ女士公開你倆愛的過程吧，使我也可於此知道戀愛的眞諦，她在受到這樣催迫而威逼，似已絲毫沒有反抗的餘力，祇能答應我們的要求，說道：蜜司脫Ｃ他是我今春結交的朋友，在Ｌ公司辦事，我很佩服他精通的文墨，而且他還是音樂的能手，他也是很愛我，所以我倆漸漸的由友誼而思訂婚而·········她紅漲了面，已不能再斷續的說下去，但是Ｗ女士也好像原諒她的，說道：很好呀幾時才可以請我們吃喜酒呢？她微微的笑了，她的面部的表演得意極了，她並沒有答覆我們，她倆同居的佳訊，但是我們在她這微笑得意之下，可以猜測她倆結合的時日並不遠了。</p>
<p>Ｓ女士和Ｃ先生是現在甜蜜的情侶，是將來美滿的良伴，在樹林花叢的公園中，在演映銀幕的影院中，常有她倆的足跡，所以同學們誰不知道，誰不羡慕這一對親愛的情侶。</p>
<p>光陰似流水般的過去忽忽已四年了，Ｃ先生和Ｓ女士倆的艶跡，已不復存在我們的腦海中，誰再去留意她倆的行動呢但是我們於無意中，覺得今年的Ｓ女士已不如往年的活潑欣喜，而變爲呆悲愁悶的神情，倘然仔細瞧她的面上，恐怕時常可以發見兩行深深的淚痕，奇了，她有甚麽悲傷而不可吿人的事呢？不覺又引起了我尋根究源的故技，而想去問她，或許也可解慰她一些痛苦吧，此日適逢星期日，於是我跑到Ｓ女士的家裏，探望她的悲事，她忍了痛對我說道：男子都是沒有良心的，他以前常對我說道：此婚姻不成，寗列不娶，親愛的妹妹，我愛你，我决不抛棄你，他用這種甜言蜜語，來哄騙我這柔弱女子，到現在他連信一次都沒有來過，經我從他的朋友方面探聽，纔曉得他，在前幾個月已經結婚了，話未說完，她已哭得和淚人兒一般，我見了她這樣的悲傷，不覺也落下同情之淚，我就安慰她一番，忽忽的吿别回家，我想戀愛是什麽原來受了哄騙的結果，有這樣的傷心，將來世界上戀愛二字，恐怕不敢接近了，因爲她和我最要好的學友，受了此種痛苦，我聽了很是嘆惜，所以記出來，請大家嘗嘗戀愛的味道如何。</p>

<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>㈠有姨太太的法官審重婚案時有姨太太和重婚的人有甚麽分别呢？這在理論上，法律上自有判斷，用不着我來曉舌，不過，我想有姨太太的法官，審起重婚案來，如非法律保障自已，心裏一定感覺忐忑不安。何以呢？因爲自已也犯同樣毛病，到底來得棘手些呢。</p>
<p>㈡上海配談風化嗎？</p>
<p>昨晚我同非非先生到法大馬路去，經過東新橋時，只見一羣妖冶惑衆的野鷄，蜂湧一個鄕下人進去。凑巧我們面前，有一個著十九世紀的衣服的人，同他並行的朋友說：『文明的上海，怎麽這樣不講風化呢？』我以爲他的話講錯了；都市本來沒有風化的，尤其是淫惡淵藪的上海，風化兩字，早已銷聲匿跡了。</p>
<p>㈢花瓶</p>
<p>花瓶這個名詞，在中華民國二十一年上半季，還沒有多大聆見，現在呢！這個名字，風行一時，報紙騰載，文學家也藉着這個『花瓶』名詞進賬一筆意外之財。這個名詞，大槪是中華民國二十一年文壇上的新發明吧。據說『花瓶』是侮辱女性的名詞，這或許有點原理。因爲女性嬌艶如花，稱她花瓶，也不失妥當哩。</p>
<p>㈣主義本來是沒有的</p>
<p>××主義的宗旨，是，解除人民痛苦，扶助勞動生活，提倡貧民敎育，擁護勞工階級。Ｓ君曾加××主義，而且是××主義的忠實信徒。近日Ｓ君得到Ｂ公司的職業，託庇資產階級原是××主義所不容。Ｓ君自進Ｂ公司之後，專事　承上峯，刻薄勞工，一變從前的面目。這是甚麽道理呢？我想主義本來是沒有的。</p>
<p>㈤别家和棄家，</p>
<p>人必有生死離别。當離别椿萱梅鶴的一刻，是如何的悲傷呀是如何戀戀不捨呀只要到××地方以後，戀愛上一個女子，什麽梅鶴椿萱，悲傷留戀，一槪都溶解了。三年不寄家書，也是說不定，彷佛惟卿無家，别無所憶念了。</p>

<p>㈠多麽痛心</p>
<p>九一八瀋陽被倭寇强占，一片焦土；一二八淞滬再遭倭寇慘刦。又是一片焦土。不期祇過數月，魯戰忽起，掖縣一片焦土，可是：一幕未閉，一幕又開演着川戰丨瀘城也是一片焦土：唉！有『九一八』『一二八』外患的一片焦土，尙產生内戰的一片焦土，多麽痛心</p>
<p>『人不犯我』『我不犯人，』是一般爭權利奪地盤軍閥的行語，可是川魯之戰，到底誰先犯人？打這樣的大出手丨生靈塗炭丨試觀；倭寇侵迫，是『人先犯我，』然而；却不去『我亦犯人。』唉？内戰則『人先犯人，』『我亦犯人；』外慮則『人先犯我，』却『我不犯人，』並且；不去抵抗絲毫，多麽痛心</p>
<p>㈡司空見慣</p>
<p>一般奸商被愛國志士警吿着，起初還稍形歛跡，可是現在呢已成『司空見慣，』不以爲奇，所以警吿由爾警吿，奸商我仍爲之，唉丨可痛丨可恨丨</p>
<p>滬戰雖然過去了好多個月，可是：還有許多遺下的爆炸物，時常爆發傷人，好像在警吿同胞，不要忘掉『一二八』，受暴日蹂𨈆的慘狀，然而；日子久了，一次次爆發着傷人，已成『司空見慣』，誰都麻木不仁，只怪撞着的不愼，却不　怪遺毒主人丨倭寇丨的賜予同胞醒吧？</p>

<p>我沒有拍馬的功夫，所以依然故我。</p>

<p>— 秦撿鷗</p>
<p>這是一篇書信格局的小說，在歐美，此刻正極普遍地盛行着。的確我也感到用這種格局來寫自叙體的小說，比較上果然又利便，又齊整··而在讀者方面，也可以從一種自然的誤認上丨，以爲是書中人的自由引起更深一層的同情。</p>
<p>××：</p>
<p>眞的雖然這兩年來，我是時刻地抱着要寫一封痛快的，眞誠的，情書給你的飢渴，但是自最初發生這一個慾望起，我就同時感覺到這封情書的不易寫：果然，今天丨最勇敢的今天，我提起筆來，第一個字就遇到了强有力的阻碍。我該怎樣的稱呼你呢？「嫂嫂」兩個字，似乎是最大一些，然而却不適用於情書，更不是我所願意寫的；那末稱你「英妹」或「曼英」吧，親熱固然是很親熱了，不過替我自已着想，又覺得過於冒險了。也許你對於我純粹是一種無意識的逗弄，根本沒有接受我這樣熱烈的稱謂的可能啊！</p>
<p>「無意識的逗弄！」我也曾這樣憂慮過！恐怖過！但是每逢這一個幻覺發生，接着便給最雄辯的事實所打破了。</p>
<p>現在，經過了廿四個月的嘗試和親炙，縱使有人用最堅實的證據來吿訴我，說黃浦江裏的水，乃是一種變態的甘泉；縱使有這樣令人難信的事實發生，我也不能再懷疑你對於我是毫無眞誠的情感了！</p>
<p>「矛盾！矛盾！」你讀了我上面這三段話，也許要大笑而狂喊了。</p>
<p>不錯，上下文是互相矛盾了。但是，小朋友，你要知道，人性原是矛盾的；尤其在一個滿腹懷疑燃燒着「愛之火」的男人，準備向一個他所「寤寐思之」的理想中的情人，傾吐他的衷曲的時候，他越是要說得透澈，眞切，便越是顚倒，矛盾。</p>
<p>便把我們的事情來做譬方：依理講，你是我的友人之妻；「朋友妻，不可戲！」古有明訓，我不該不知道，也不會不知道，老實說，我不但早已知道，而且照我平日的言许而論，我是「戲朋友妻者」的最有力的反對派，甚至我不願意我的朋友向我妻子說一句話。但是我竟非常積極的攫住你做了我熱戀的對手了，我竟千方百計的調戲着朋友之妻了。這還不是矛盾到了極點嗎？</p>
<p>矛盾是已經矛盾了，我不但不願意糾正我這矛盾的思想，消滅這矛盾的行爲，而且我是虔誠地祈禱着，惟恐這種矛盾的思想，矛盾的行爲，不能繼續；即使我因此而喪失了我一生的名譽，抛棄了我所有的一切，我是絕不後悔　　丨丨祇靜待着死神的來臨。</p>
<p>其實，親愛的小朋友，在這兩年之中，我也未嘗不由道德的刺激，而幾度拚出一種含有羞意的悔悟；無奈我祇是一個極平凡的小商人，何來慧劍，自然是斬不斷這一縷堅韌的情絲了所以每一次的悔悟所佔有的時間，祇像電光石火一般的不到幾分鐘，至多也只一兩小時而已。</p>
<p>記得民國十九年的三月十三日，兩年前的一個春天的傍晚。天氣是最適宜的微溫，租界馬路兩旁的法國梧桐，正在競爭着長出鮮嫩的綠葉來。每一個過路的少女，那把新從大公司的櫉窗裏搬回來的新裝，極稱體的披在窈窕而富有肉感的身上，透着極度興奮態度，很驕傲地挾着各人的俘虜，在汽車裏，在電車裏，在人行道上，分頭前進。就在這個時候，由都市的大學畢業生而轉變爲縣立師範校長的我，度過了七個月的孤苦的鄕村生活，重新又離開了慈愛的父親，賷淑而木訥的妻子，活潑的女兒，穿着一九三○年最新式的西裝，大踱步向着這「大厦穿雲化」的上海，踴躍而來</p>
<p>我這一次的毅然第二度投進這熾旺的爐來的動機，當然不是爲的你。因爲那時候，我簡直還沒有發現世界上竟有像你這樣一個美得令人懷疑的女人咧！丨我是單純的爲着要多僗幾個錢而到上海來的！</p>
<p>月薪二百五十七元，對外便是獨擋一面的華總經理。這樣已經夠我快活得忘記名姓了。何况，在這優越的位置之外，更有一件可喜的事情：就是我的老同學，你的法律上的情人，丨周大經丨恰巧在一個月前，也從濟南到了上海。</p>

<h3 id="c230">好萊塢的牲畜代辦所 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 凜</p>
<p>好萊塢新近發見了一個牲畜代辦所。這係很新穎的一種營業，因爲這個代辦所内，大如象，小如鼠，猛知虎，毒如蛇，狡如猴，色色俱備，應有盡有。凡影戲公司需要何種牲畜，可以用電話呼喚，頃刻而至。譬如說，你明天十點鐘，要一隻白熊，要能從二十尺的高台上，躍入水中，這通通可以照辦的。</p>
<p>創辦這代辦所的人，從事於獸類的訓練，以供結各影戲塲的需要，已有七年之久。他的名字呌派脫海黎（ＰatＨealey）。他是一個少說話，多做事的人。他在這已往的七年之中，從來沒有過受之託而沒有辦到的事。各影戲公司向他需索的東西，奇奇怪怪，非但禽獸，並且有需要蟲豸之類的東西，但海黎必定能設法羅致，不負重託。</p>
<p>有許多和海黎需索東西的人，可以說是毫無常識的。他們常時要一只小獅子，或是一條毛蟲，或是一只燕子，而並不想想這種東西是不是當令的。所以海黎惟一的職，就是不論春夏秋冬，遇有不當時的東西，就要設法向各方搜羅。他的代表普通於全世界，所用的運輸方法，各輪船，飛機，火車，郵便等等，莫不力求迅速，以討好於他的主顧們。但海黎並不以此爲煩，反以爲事業的樂趣，就是這點『能爲人之所不能。』</p>
<p>但是從事實上說，平常好萊塢影戲塲所需要的東西，是用不著十分費事向海外去尋覓的。據說好萊塢這個地方，奇怪得很。差不多世界上所有的東西，好萊塢都找得出來，因爲在好萊塢的四週，就有許多男男女女，專門靠飼養牲畜爲生的。各種各樣的珍禽異獸，通通可以臨時向各家豢養所去租用的。他們每一家都有一家的專長，鱷魚，熊，猴，獅，鴕鳥，蛇，狐，黃雀，鴿，貓頭鷹，老鷹等等係可向各家去租的。還有許多山海經上的怪物，亦可以託代辦所設法借賃得着的。</p>
<p>海黎說：現在的影戲看客，已經不比從前了。從前一件東西缺少了，可以用别的相橡的東西替代的，但是現在不行了。所以代辦所的工作，尤其繁重了些。下面所列的一個表。就是各種普通獸類每天租用的價錢：</p>
<p>象　　　　　　　　　一百元　　海狗　　三十五元</p>
<p>獅·虎·豹·熊等··　　　　　　　　　二十五元</p>
<p>猴　　　　　　　　　二十元　　蛇　　　　十五元</p>
<p>家貓　　　　　　　七角五分　　兎　　　二角五分</p>
<p>但是這種價格，是不可以一槪而論的，還要看牠們的本領如何。譬如一只狗，一天租金一元五角，但是機警些，能扮演戲的，就要每天一百五十元。當然鈴丁丁更不在此例了。</p>

<p>— 瑞英</p>
<p>大槪看過「小女伶」的人，都已經領會到十五歲小明星袁美雲的技巧了。她一切的喜怒哀樂的表情，一一都在天眞的表情中流露出來聞得袁美雲前曾奏藝於天蟾舞臺，天一老板邵醉翁，因賞識她的表現天才，特地爲她編了一本劇，請她擔任主角，袁美雲居然不辱使命，能從從容容的顯露着她天才的鋒芒。在「小女伶」中，有好幾段可以使人流淚的，如黑夜見窗外人影而躍起的情狀，返家遇母的情景，又多麽深深地打進了觀衆的内心啊！</p>

<p>小妹妹黎明暉，自港來滬，倐已數月。由於邵醉翁之亟力說項，以及乃父錦暉之從中介紹，遂正式投入天一。但加入以來，迄今又將數旬，天一當局，依然未將明暉主演之劇本編就。而其他如陳玉梅，陸麗霞，袁美雲等，則一劇方完，他劇已續而拍演。明暉慣動而不慣靜。近日空間若是。芳心誠抑鬱莫名也。</p>

<h3 id="c235">愛的估價 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>凡在戀愛中的靑年們，大槪都在希望知道愛的估價値若干吧？在國秦映的新片：「愛的估價」中，也並沒有吿訴準確的解答；仍只是很含混的說，愛可以用無錢買的而已，這倒很切合於原來劇名「買」（Ｂought）·但是牠恐怕大家都以爲，愛情只是買來的，所以在末尾，牠仍指破了買得愛情的幻滅，純潔愛情的完滿結合，</p>
<p>牠在譏笑着女子的好金錢，男子的講門楣，和别的愛情片沒什麽兩樣的詆謗虚榮的戀愛！</p>
<p>劇情大槪是說：一個私生女，自食其力的生活着和一位窮文人很相得，但是在物質上，却受了一位老紳士，不少帮助，不久，她認識了一位富家少年，就把舊戀人抛在腦後了，當這少年知道她是一個私生女以後，雙方已訂的婚約，就决裂了，她再回到老紳士家中時，舊情人已先在等着她，她這才問明白，這巨富的紳士，是她的生身之父，在她和那舊情人言歸於好，互相擁抱中，這一幕劇就結束了！</p>
<p>康絲登裴納持（ＣonstanceＢennett），扮這天眞無知，情竇初開的少女，比已往的成績都好，酒醉的兩幕，作得神妙得很，本來一個毫無經騐的女子，一步踏上了社會之路，她種種的表露，丨喜，怒，哀，樂，丨不由於衷，康絲登演此，設身處地的，出於自然，利却裴納特（ＲichardＢennett），飾那紳士，老成莊重，令人生敬畏心，事實上的眞父女，扮這劇中的假父女，互相的對白表情，絲絲入扣，活寫一雙慈父弱女，也許這是天性使然，彭里昻（ＢenＢyon），飾文學家，雖然不太合宜，但是也有可觀的地方，至少還可以談得到有内心表演，瑞門米藍（ＲaymondＭilland），的確是美而健的靑年，種花花公子，紈袴少年的個性，表露無遺，以他的美貎說，恐怕好萊塢屬得着的了，導演也許正利用他的美，來作女子虚榮一個對像吧配角的齊整是華納公司往行所沒有的。</p>
<p>導演攝影的合作，有極良好的成績，光綫有時太亮了（如月夜數幕再暗些一定更浪漫些，不過大致還好，</p>
<p>小穿插和暗寫，是極優美的，如人去影留，烟斗放出的烟；三次的生日禮，·········都有呌人回憶的力量前後對照比較，也很能動人的感情，無形中表現一種心靈上矛盾和物質上變幻，</p>
<p>不過中間一段，可以短一些；而末尾，紳士書房的女子照片，應當特寫，以引起觀衆的注意，因爲喜劇的中心，就是歸根到這照片呢！</p>

<p>— 星宿</p>
<p>無論是何種戲劇，影劇或舞台劇，牠的唯一信條，便是「戲而不能當戲做」，「小女伶」就是犯了太當戲做的毛病。開塲表現王氏的潑悍，似乎離開了情理，何必把公公丈夫，都形容到這樣懦弱的地步，不打公公，不打丈夫，難道在這個人生裏，就沒有適當合理的材料了麽</p>
<p>小琳的家庭，並不怎樣的窮困，我們可從佈景中見到。不然，王氏何以能得行同拆白的陳乃新的歡心呢？但是小琳的祖父，在落魄以後，却似醜態畢露的鄕愚，何致不見世故一至如此，因爲形容過分，就發生了這樣的矛盾。</p>
<p>小琳只是一個初登舞台的小女伶罷了，怎會平地一聲雷，就紅到這般步地，并且以後，小琳的師母就不知往何處去了，再不見面，這裏，已足夠見到編劇者，對於人生的認識太缺乏了。</p>
<p>寄仲積憤成疾時，王氏接情人的電話因寄仲呻吟，而致她聽不淸電話，就發怒叱責，和寄仲病中口渴的這一幕，竟然和王氏病中，遭到陳乃新的待遇，不差絲毫，弄巧成拙，未免太笨。誰都敢决定，在這世界裏，沒這樣一般無二的對照的生活的。</p>
<p>小琳寫到家裏去的一封信，信封上寫的是「張家浜交母親大人收」，那郵差不知如何，却會曉得這投信人的母親的原來地址，竟然送去找尋，幾時會見有過這樣聰明的郵差，但是郵差的聰明，也就是導演的笨拙。</p>
<p>女主角袁美雲，她根能做戲，成績也不錯，却是一個有希望的人才，這是不可埋沒的。</p>

<p>這是表情獨習法第六式。綀習的方法，和前五式略微有些不同，先對你鏡中的眉心注意。（不要忘記，你的眼睛與鏡子必須距離一尺以外。）然後在慢慢默數『一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，』的時候，由鼻管中徐徐吸進一品氣去。同時你的嘴慢慢地嘻開，你的眼眶慢慢地瞇攏，實行『笑遂顏開』這四個字的意義，在數完八個字的時候，剛剛變成一張彌勒佛樣的笑臉。</p>
<p>和從前一樣，在保留往這一口氣和這一個笑容的時候，慢慢默數『一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，』（當然是不許出聲的。）這時候你要十分注意，必須把這個笑容一絲不走的保留住，髣鬌你是對着相機要留一個笑容的像片似的。這一種功夫我知道許多人是不容易做到的。因爲她們從來沒有對着鏡子看過自已這樣的尊容，一看就會忍不住的大笑起來。這一笑不要緊，却把保留住的一口氣完全噴出來了。切記！在留住這笑容的時候要保留得一絲不走纔對。</p>
<p>然後逐漸增加笑的程度，在默數『一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，』呼出這一口氣來的時候，你的眼睛越瞇越攏，你的嘴也越嘻越開，笑到『八』字的時候，你已經笑得把肺部裏的氣完全笑了出來，到了轉不過氣來的地步。</p>

<h3 id="e1">To the Fifty-One Nation Representative Assembly, the Atmosphere is Quite Tense. Our Representative Yan Makes a Four-Point Request <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Declaring Japan's Violation of Treaties</p>
<p>Japanese Troops to Withdraw, Puppet State to Disband</p>
<p>Declaring Non-Recognition of Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>Establishing a Date for Report Completion</p>
<p>Matsuoka Actually Proposes International Co-Management of China, a Ridiculous Theory</p>
<p>Failure to Resolve the Sino-Japanese Dispute Affects the Survival of the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Special Assembly opened at 11:00 AM on the 6th (6:00 PM Shanghai time). Foreign Minister Hymans of Belgium, as Chairman, delivered the opening address, followed by our Chief Representative Yan Huiqing, who delivered China's views on the Lytton Report. Matsuoka followed Yan, presenting the Japanese side's views. Irish representative Connolly will also speak, outlining the proceedings of the Executive Yuan's meeting. Representatives from other small countries are scheduled to speak, with many needing to be moved to the second session on the 7th. This assembly is expected to last about three or four days. It is predicted that before the assembly closes, a resolution will be made on the Lytton Report, expressing acceptance in principle but leaving the method for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute to be drafted by the Nineteen-Nation Committee before being submitted to the assembly for discussion. (6th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Special Assembly formally convened this morning to discuss the Manchurian issue. Representatives from fifty-one nations were present, with only Honduras, Argentina, Nicaragua, Peru, El Salvador, and Lithuania absent. French Prime Minister Herriot and British Foreign Secretary Simon entered the assembly hall arm-in-arm ten minutes before the opening and chatted for five minutes before taking their seats. At 11:05 AM, British Prime Minister MacDonald entered the hall, went straight to the podium, exchanged a few words with Chairman Hymans, and then took his seat. German Foreign Minister Neurath quietly entered, not engaging in conversation with politicians from surrounding countries, and seemed to have a worried expression, which contrasted sharply with the beaming smiles of Herriot, MacDonald, Simon, and others. (6th, Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) In a corner of the assembly hall, cameras and film cameras were lined up to capture the opening moments. Unfortunately, the acoustics in the hall were very poor, making it difficult to clearly hear the speakers. Even Dr. Yan, one of Geneva's most skilled orators, was affected by this. Japanese representative Matsuoka, who began speaking at 12:10 PM, was also hampered by the poor acoustics. Both the Chinese and Japanese representatives' speeches were closely listened to by the audience. The French translation of the Chinese representative's speech was not read. Dr. Yan read a document in his speech that stated that Japanese soldiers had massacred 2,700 villagers, men, women, and children, simply because volunteer soldiers had passed through their village. Dr. Yan also cited a telegram from an American journalist who personally investigated the matter. At 1:00 PM, the assembly adjourned and reconvened at 3:30 PM, at which time representatives from Ireland, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden, among others, were scheduled to speak. During Matsuoka's speech, when addressing the Japanese troops' massacre of Chinese people, he said that the Japanese official report on the matter had already been sent to the Executive Yuan. According to information from the Japanese side, the news reporter obtained the information from a clergyman and then sent a distorted telegram. (6th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[P Hymans Delivers Opening Address&gt;</p>
<p>(Geneva) After declaring the League of Nations Assembly open, Chairman Hymans delivered a speech stating that he convened the assembly based on the authority granted by the League of Nations and reaffirmed by the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, believing that there was no need to reaffirm the preparatory documents. He then invited Spanish representative Madariaga to speak. Mr. Madariaga stated that this meeting was a continuation of the League of Nations Special Assembly held on March 3rd of this year and that the representatives present would naturally replace the vice-chairmen who were elected last time but are not present now, and that those succeeding their positions should naturally take over the duties of the assembly. Hymans agreed with this proposal, and it was passed by the assembly. The chairman then stated that the powers of the General Committee established on March 3rd were still valid. There are two issues on the agenda: one is China's petition, and the other is the appointment of Avenol to succeed Drummond as Secretary-General of the League of Nations. In February of this year, China petitioned the League of Nations under Article 15 of the Covenant. The League of Nations Special Assembly convened and decided in March to await the Lytton Report. This report has now been submitted, with the Executive Yuan adding its comments and sending it to the assembly on November 28th. The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee supports this move and is considering China's request regarding the deadline. The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee decided to deliberate on this request after seeing the outcome of the assembly's discussion. The assembly is now paying attention to the current documents, namely the Lytton Report and its attachments, as well as the opinion papers from both China and Japan. The Lytton Report must be used as the basis for discussion. The representatives of both parties should have priority to speak on the nature of other documents and supporting evidence. Therefore, he invited Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiqing to speak on behalf of China. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yan Huiqing's Speech <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japan's Continuous Aggression, a Pre-Determined Plan</p>
<p>Demanding the League of Nations Swiftly Adopt Effective Sanctions</p>
<p>Dr. Yan first thanked the Executive Yuan for its prompt review of the Lytton Report, allowing the assembly to continue its work. Dr. Yan then stated that since the assembly adjourned nine months ago, the situation did not seem to have changed significantly. At that time, he had spoken, asking the assembly to do everything in its power to stop hostile acts and urge the withdrawal of invading troops, and to seek a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute within the scope of the Executive Yuan's resolution and the spirit of the Covenant. The aforementioned demands referred to both Manchuria and Shanghai. The assembly dealt with the entire issue with the resolution passed on March 11th, paying special attention to Manchuria. The Executive Yuan's resolution, which the assembly resolution cited, and which the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee produced to implement, contained Japan's promise to withdraw its troops and refrain from any actions that would further exacerbate the situation. The question now is whether Japan has fulfilled its commitments. Page 77 of the Lytton Report contains the answer, stating that Japan is still handling the Manchurian situation according to its predetermined plan. In fact, Japan did act according to its plan until Manchuria, including Jinzhou, Taonan, and Qiqihar, had all been occupied. Moreover, since the September 18th Incident last year, the activities of the Japanese military authorities have been very politically motivated. The Chinese governance of all important cities in Manchuria has been eliminated and replaced by new administrations. The Manchurian independence movement was unheard of before September of last year. Only after the Japanese military occupied the area did the independence movement become possible, and it was initiated, organized, and implemented by Japanese military personnel and civilians. The Japanese General Staff clearly understood the role of this independence movement. The Lytton Commission of Inquiry, having received evidence from various sources, also understood that there were two reasons for the creation of "Manchukuo": one was the presence of the Japanese army in Manchuria, and the other was the activities of Japanese civilian and military officials. Therefore, the current political situation cannot be considered to have survived due to a genuine independence movement. Dr. Yan then cited the Executive Yuan President's declaration of September 24th, which stated that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" could only be seen as hindering the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Dr. Yan also cited the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee Chairman's expression of regret on October 1st regarding Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo." Dr. Yan continued, saying that it was gratifying that the Lytton Commission of Inquiry stated in its report that the commission supported the principles of important international treaties applicable to the China issue. These principles include the inviolability of China's territorial and administrative integrity, which are matters stipulated in Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the obligation to resolve international difficulties by peaceful means as stipulated in the Pact of Paris and the League of Nations Covenant. However, he regretted that the Lytton Report did not, based on its findings, make a more concrete elaboration on these principles and conclude that Japan was an aggressor beyond any doubt. Japan's unprovoked initiation of hostilities and implementation of military actions that could not be regarded as legitimate self-defense, and Japan's creation of "Manchukuo" and formal recognition of it, violated any multilateral treaties applicable to this issue and disregarded the authority of the League of Nations. There is no doubt that Japan is an aggressor. If the Lytton Report had made a formal statement on this point and instructed Japan to disband "Manchukuo," withdraw its troops, and compensate the Chinese people for the loss of life and property, then the conclusions in the report would have been more reasonable. In the minds of the commission, this plan was what the assembly should have done, so China now hopes that the League of Nations Assembly will implement this plan. The Lytton Report did not stipulate a temporary arrangement for the return of Manchuria to China before a general solution was reached. The Chinese government believes that this has been left to the assembly to handle. The Lytton Report still needs to be revised and supplemented. The Chinese government believes that the report contains sufficient facts for the League of Nations to use as a basis for dealing with this issue. Now, please pay attention to the conclusions in the Lytton Report:</p>
<p>(1) The claim made by the Japanese that the 300 pending Sino-Japanese cases have exhausted peaceful methods of resolution is unsubstantiated. (2) The Japanese military's actions on the night of September 18th cannot be regarded as legitimate self-defense. (3) Although Japan made reservations in Geneva, it continued to handle the Manchurian situation according to its predetermined plan. (4) Japan initiated, organized, and implemented the "Manchukuo" independence movement.</p>
<p>Looking at the above points, it is clear that Japan deliberately and intentionally used force and political conspiracies to seize Manchuria, disregarding the authority of the League of Nations and the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Although the Lytton Commission of Inquiry made clear judgments, Japan has not yet expressed its willingness to accept the principles advocated by the report, which is that any solution must be in accordance with the provisions of these international instruments. Japan's proposal to begin direct negotiations based on its five basic principles cannot be accepted by China or the Executive Yuan. The simple reason is that China or the Executive Yuan cannot accept starting negotiations under military coercion, and there is no need to mature this matter. However, the Japanese said that since Japan's proposal was not adopted, the Manchurian incident continued to progress and has become an irreversible situation today. The Japanese are directly stating that because the Executive Yuan did not adopt Japan's proposal to begin direct Sino-Japanese negotiations under its military pressure, Japan was free to expand its military occupation, establish a puppet state, and recognize it, so that Japan could permanently maintain its military occupation. Japan has already taken this kind of action but still pretends that Japan cannot withdraw its troops. Now Japan says, "You may propose any mediation methods, but do not touch 'Manchukuo.'" In this situation, we dare to ask, what opportunity is there for mediation? Dr. Yan then reviewed the developments in the Sino-Japanese dispute over the past ten months, saying that the Chinese government has not made any accusations about the slowness of the League of Nations' peaceful machinery. However, the slowness of the League of Nations' actions has not affected both parties equally but has only increased China's difficulties. Therefore, he requested the League of Nations to act quickly. He now makes four requests:</p>
<p>(1) This special assembly should declare that Japan has violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>(2) The assembly should order Japan to withdraw its troops to the railway zone, so that the so-called "Manchukuo" government can be disbanded.</p>
<p>(3) The assembly should declare non-recognition of the "Manchukuo" government based on the resolution passed on March 11th.</p>
<p>(4) The assembly should set a clear date and announce it, publishing a report on the final resolution of the dispute between the two parties within the shortest possible time, in accordance with Section 4 of Article 15 of the Covenant.</p>
<p>Dr. Yan finally stated that one of the real points of contention in the current Sino-Japanese dispute has been explained by Sir Lytton. Sir Lytton said, "If this dispute is not resolved in accordance with the principles of the Covenant, it will not only harm China's rights but also hinder the survival of the League of Nations." This statement is concise and to the point. (6th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Matsuoka's Absurd Remarks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>丨Completely Disregarding the League of Nations丨</p>
<p>Attempting to Conceal the Truth to Deceive the World</p>
<p>Adding Insult to Injury to Confuse International Public Opinion</p>
<p>Matsuoka rose to speak, addressing the key points where Japan's views differed from the optimistic descriptions of China's construction in the Lytton Report, saying that a country in such disarray could not be revitalized quickly. Japan had been extremely patient with China. Although Japan had strived to be friendly with China, it ultimately failed due to China's mistakes. Japan did not want to reach today's situation. Japan only sought respect for treaty rights and the safety of Japanese citizens' lives and property. However, the Chinese government, relying on Russia's assistance, caused Japan's efforts to fail. Last year, Japan repeatedly attempted to negotiate directly with China but did not succeed. Even the Executive Yuan did not support these attempts. Anti-Japanese propaganda in China increased day by day. It should be known that China's victory in the West would bring misfortune to the East. Japan did not apply to the League of Nations because Japan could not expect effective protection from the League of Nations. Matsuoka then asked why, when Britain, France, the United States, and Japan sent troops to Shanghai in 1927, the Executive Yuan unanimously approved it. At that time, there was no protest from the League of Nations or the Chinese government. Even in the current Manchurian incident, Japan has not seen any way the League of Nations can provide assistance to Japan. Furthermore, it should be noted that there is an important distinction between the Shanghai incident and the Manchurian incident, which is that Japan had already stationed troops in Manchuria according to treaties. The real reason for the current Sino-Japanese dispute is the incompatibility between China's actual situation and the expectations of modern China. As for the independence of "Manchukuo," the Japanese government is not responsible for it. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the Tokyo government did not want Manchuria to be independent. The Japanese government has never participated in the independence movement. However, the Japanese people sympathize with the "Manchukuo" government because the problems they have been worried about for forty years can be resolved through the establishment of "Manchukuo." The Japanese believe that future peace should be sought in "Manchukuo." Matsuoka then declared, "We want peace. We did not want Manchuria before, and we do not want Manchuria now. But it should be known that all the people of Japan believe that Manchuria is the key to solving all the problems in the Far East. It is often heard in Geneva that Japan's actions in Manchuria will promote China's unification. Japan does not pay much attention to this kind of alarm because Japan believes that a truly unified China will be a peaceful China, not a military one." At this time, China's army is larger than any country in the world. China's army was not initially established to defend the country. Matsuoka then attacked the Chinese government, saying that the Chinese government was initially established with the help of Russia, causing China to become a communist state. Even now, it can only rule a portion of its territory because the number of provinces occupied by the Communist Party is equal to the number of provinces ruled by the government. Japan cannot turn a blind eye to future trends. Matsuoka continued to declare that the assembly should review the Manchurian incident in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) The settlement conditions must be practical and have the nature of immediately realizing peace in the Far East. (2) Efforts should be made to remedy China's chaotic situation. (3) If the League of Nations formulates a settlement procedure, the League of Nations should be responsible for its implementation.</p>
<p>Matsuoka said, "For such an attempt, is any member state of the League of Nations prepared to cooperate with other countries?" Matsuoka believes that the war between China and Japan did not occur before the Manchurian incident, nor did the difficulties of other related countries. This is indeed due to the intervention of the League of Nations. It can be said that the League of Nations has reached its noble goal, but in the current situation, it would be excessive to make further demands on China. In short, the situation in the East is constantly changing, and it is not appropriate to use it as a standard to match our will and actions. (6th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Matsuoka finished his speech at 1:00 PM. The chairman announced that four national representatives had already registered to express their views in the general discussion. These four national representatives are Irish representative Connolly, Czechoslovak representative Beneš, Swedish representative Undén, and Norwegian representative Lange. The assembly will reconvene at 3:30 PM. (6th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Government Holds Spanish Representative in Utter Contempt</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, representatives from eight countries, including Sweden, Mexico, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands, held a private meeting to coordinate their steps in dealing with the assembly. It is reported that they have unanimously agreed to uphold the charter and condemn the atrocities. (5th, Hualian News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives from eight small countries, including Belgium, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Switzerland, met this morning to discuss the attitudes their respective countries should take when the League of Nations Special Assembly tries the Sino-Japanese dispute tomorrow. Before this, the representatives of the eight small countries would often confer on the attitude to take towards disarmament issues. However, today was the first time they held a semi-official meeting to discuss how to act in unison regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. During the meeting, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš presented his views, which he intends to advocate from the platform of the Special Assembly. Beneš's intention is to reaffirm the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant and to ensure that they are protected in any case. The representatives of the various countries unanimously agreed with Beneš's views and decided to reconvene. (6th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the eight small countries, the Dutch representative stated that the Netherlands could not act in unison with the other small countries without reservations, but as one of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty, it must maintain a free hand. (6th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation in Geneva received intelligence from the League of Nations today stating that the Czech representative had consulted with various small countries and then agreed with Drummond on the assembly procedures. It is reported that it has been decided that once the assembly opens, it will entrust the committee to review and unconditionally approve Chapters 1 to 8 of the Lytton Report. As for Chapters 9 and 10, a conciliation committee will be formed, consisting of the Nineteen-Nation Committee and representatives from the United States and Russia, to convene a conciliation committee within a week to discuss political solutions. It is reported that the United States has agreed to participate. The Japanese representatives, upon hearing this news, are at a loss and must make a decision within a week on whether to agree. If they want to continue to carry out their past threats, it will not work and they will sever ties with the League of Nations. The Japanese delegation presents an unusually gloomy atmosphere tonight. (5th, Hualian News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report from the Geneva delegation stating that the eight-nation meeting held yesterday wanted to unanimously maintain justice and the dignity of treaties. This was initiated by the Spanish representative. The Japanese government hates them to the bone and wants to find an opportunity to counter Spain. (6th, Hualian News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Insisting on Recognizing the Independence of the Puppet State or Withdrawing</p>
<p>Encouraging the League of Nations to Temporarily Adopt a Wait-and-See Policy of Procrastination</p>
<p>Tokyo: The League of Nations Provisional General Assembly will convene in Geneva at 11:00 AM this month. Japan's countermeasures for this have been instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Representative Matsuoka to be firm and unwavering. The Japanese delegation has decided to guide the League of Nations according to the following principles: (1) There is no other way to resolve the Manchurian issue other than clearly recognizing the independence of Manchuria. The Japanese government will vote against any resolution that violates this principle and is prepared to withdraw from the League of Nations. (1) The Manchurian issue has disappeared due to the independence of Manchuria. From this perspective, the League of Nations should not want to discuss the Manchurian issue forever. Therefore, it is believed that the League of Nations' future concern lies in the future of Manchukuo and that adopting a temporary wait-and-see attitude is the most appropriate. Further discussion of the past handling methods should trust the Japanese government and be carried out on the principle of rejecting the participation of third countries.

<h3 id="e9">The American Army of the Starving <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, Washington D.C., the seat of the White House, has been disturbed. First, there was the uproar of veterans of the European war demanding annual pensions, which resulted in bloodshed after ten days. Recently, there has been an invasion of the army of the starving. The authorities are on high alert, as if facing a formidable enemy. Police have used tear gas to deal with the starving people. The severity of the situation is unprecedented. It is inevitable that people, driven by hunger and cold, will take desperate measures. It is also understandable that the authorities will increase vigilance and oppression at a time when people are restless and society is uneasy. Observers may criticize this as going against the tide, but the authorities must feel that they have an unshirkable responsibility. As the conflict between the top and bottom intensifies daily, the crisis of social revolution becomes more imminent. The masks of equality, freedom, justice, and humanity have been completely exposed. The tragic scenes of great bloodshed and riots will inevitably follow.</p>
<p>The current global panic is an inevitable result of the expansion of productivity under the private property system. Therefore, the greater the productivity, the more severe the panic. Consequently, the United States, the richest country in the world with the highest productivity, has been the most severely affected. The number of unemployed has reached 12 million, accounting for one-tenth of the total population of 125 million. Compared with the 50 million employed during the peak of 1929, it is almost a quarter. Compared with the total number of 25 million unemployed worldwide, it accounts for almost half, which is also alarming.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of panic is a result of overproduction and low prices. Farmers transport wheat to the market, and the value is not even enough to cover transportation costs, so they resort to using wheat as wages. On the one hand, there are farmers using wheat as wages, and on the other hand, there are starving people with haggard faces. It is unreasonable and indefensible. But why can't the wheat used as wages be used to relieve the starving people? Because the result of using wheat as wages is that the stock of wheat gradually decreases, and the price of wheat may be expected to rise, while the relief of the starving depends on the purchase of wheat by the state and public organizations. Farmers' voluntary assistance with wheat will reduce the need for wheat. Furthermore, the farmers who have been deeply hurt by this economic panic have no extra resources to make this generous donation. Thus, although the matter is unreasonable, it is inevitable in the situation. This also shows that the development of capitalism has reached the final years of its life, and the inevitable contradictions in its system, even with any sophisticated and ingenious solutions, are ultimately impossible to reconcile.</p>
<p>After the extreme comes prosperity. According to the precedents of the panic cycle in economic history, the recovery of prosperity is not far away. This is what American capitalists use to comfort themselves and others. However, according to the results of the research by its special committee on unemployment issues, there are many reasons for unemployment in the United States that are still attributed to the result of fewer and fewer workers being needed after industrial rationalization, organizational improvement, and mechanical progress. Therefore, even if the industry returns to normal, the unemployment problem will still be impossible to solve. Can panic really circulate permanently? Can prosperity finally be restored? It is already a huge question mark. And even after the restoration of prosperity, the unemployment problem still cannot be solved, then the so-called prosperity to comfort oneself and others is ultimately deceiving oneself and others.</p>
<p>For decades, when people in our country talked about the rich and powerful, they often took the United States as an example. Until recently, new-style intellectuals still talked incessantly about the democratic politics of the United States. We should think about it, and think about it again. With such an ideal society and such a paradise, will we still blindly seek it while closing our eyes and ears and extinguishing our conscience, or will we change our course and seek other good methods?</p>

<p>Begging the Government to Consult the Soviet Union for Ways to Transport to Shanghai from Vladivostok</p>
<p>Hailar Defense Maintained by Gui Fu</p>
<p>Hailar Su Bingwen and Others Telegrammed on the 4th: All Newspaper Offices are Aware that This Army is Entrusted by the Public to Fight Against the Brutality of the Japanese Bandits. Swearing to Save the Country for Two Months Now, We Knew Early On That We Were Located in a Remote Border Area with Weak Forces and Were Unable to Secure Victory. Merely Because the Japanese Bandits Used Our People's Opinions to Confuse the World's Audience, We Had to Righteously Denounce Them to Manifest the True Public Opinion of Our Northeast. Ever Since the Day We Issued the Declaration to Raise Troops, We Resolved to Sink the Boat and Break the Kettle. Since the Righteous Uprising in Heilongjiang and Jilin, Righteous Armies Responded in All Directions, and Our Frontline Soldiers Fought Bloody Battles, Repeatedly Defeating the Fierce Enemy and Approaching Longsha Horizontally Across the Railway. Telegrams Raced and Dispatches Spread, and the World Was Shocked. The Propaganda of Justice Has Seen Significant Effects. The Japanese Bandits, Seeing Our Loyalty and Courage, Suddenly Changed Their Strategy, Sending Envoys to Negotiate Peace and Vigorously Seeking to Soften Us with Sweet Words and Heavy Bribes, All of Which Were Sternly Rejected by Our Side. With Their Tricks Exhausted, They Greatly Increased Their Troops, Relying on Their Weapons to Attack Fiercely to the West. The Intensity of the Fierce Battle is Difficult to Exhaust. Our Soldiers Have Endured Bitter Battles for Months, Enduring Hunger and Cold, Swearing to Resist to the Death. Wounds and Deaths Pile Up Like Pillows, Unwavering and Unyielding. Although the Enemy is Stubborn, Their Determination Has Not Been Achieved. Furthermore, On the Eastern Day, They Dispatched a Large Number of Armored Vehicles, Cavalry, and Artillery to Combine Various Teams to Launch a Surprise Attack on Our Zhalaite Banner Headquarters. Airplanes Assisted in the Battle, and the Situation Was Extremely Fierce. Although Our Forces Were Very Weak, They Advanced Wave Upon Wave, Fearless of Death, and None Did Not Stand Against a Hundred. Loyalty and Courage Were Doubled, and the Enemy's Flames Were Cold, and Casualties Increased Greatly. Heaven Did Not Protect China. We Have Exhausted Our Ammunition and Have No Reinforcements. The Enemy Has Increased Endlessly. Furthermore, Many Airplanes Bombed and Destroyed Our Rear Railway, Cutting Off Transportation. Foreign Travelers Along the Line All Felt Threatened, and Employees at All Stations Suffered Disaster. All Bridges Were Mostly Destroyed, and Casualties Among Soldiers Exceeded Half, and Our Strength Was Difficult to Sustain. This Army, Righteously Swearing to Raise Troops, Would Not Find it Difficult to Fight to the Death at the City Gate with the Entire Army. We Alone Remember that Local People Have Suffered Disaster for Two Months, Suffering from Hunger and Drowning, and There are Many Foreign Nationals Along the Line. If We Continue to Resist Firmly, We Will Perish Together, Which Will Not Help the Facts. For Humanitarian Reasons, I, Jiang Wan, Painfully Led My Officers, Soldiers, Dependents, Local Officials, Patriotic People, and More Than 4,000 People Who Were Unwilling to be Subjugated People to Manzhouli Station. I Have Already Retreated to the Soviet Union on Branch Late, Intending to Borrow a Way Back Home to Work Separately and Circumvent the Enemy. As Long as I Breathe, This Will is Unremitting. I respectfully Telegram the Reasons and Urge Our Government to Quickly Consult the Soviet Government to Find a Way to Transport to Shanghai from Vladivostok, or Send Ships from Shanghai to Vladivostok to Receive Patriotic Soldiers and Women and Children to Avoid Hardship on the Way and Return to the Motherland as Soon as Possible. Please Also Ask Our Support Association and Public Organizations to Assist the Government to Quickly Grant Rescue, Shedding Tears to Express Words, Which Cannot be More Urgent to Await Orders.

My Department Was Attacked on Several Sides. On the Morning of the 3rd, Before Dawn, We Withdrew to the West of the Xing'an Mountains. We Left Hailar on the Night of the 3rd and Transferred to Russian Territory on the 4th. First, We Gathered at a Certain Place and Transferred Back Home. 2) My Department's Withdrawal From Manzhouli Has Been Detailed in the Telegram.

All Parties Are Paying Close Attention to How Su and Others Will Return Home After Finding a Way to Vladivostok. The Authorities Are Also Continuing to Study the Reasons for the Withdrawal of Troops From China and the Soviet Union. It is Reported That the Japanese Army in North Manchuria Increased Its Troops by Six Divisions to Specially Attack Su, and Assisted With More Than 200 Airplanes. After the Start of the War, Japanese Planes Bombed Along the Railway Line. The National Salvation Army Was Unable to Respond Before and After, and There Were No Defenses Across the Xing'an Mountains, so When Retreating, Ma Zhanshan's Department Arrived at Nehe Because the News Was Not Timely, and He Did Not Advance. Pu Bingshan's Department Near Keshan Also Took No Action Against the Japanese Army (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Telegram Said That the Japanese Army Recently Attacked Su Bingwen's Department With All Its Strength.

<p>(Tokyo) The Saying That the Japanese Army Has Been in Hailar for a Long Time is Obviously Without Basis. According to Recent News From Qiqihar, It is Expected That the Japanese Army May Not be Able to Enter Hailar Before Wednesday.

<p>(Tokyo) General Su Bingwen, the Commander of the Righteous Army in North Manchuria, Escaped Into Russian Territory Because His Troops Were Defeated by the Japanese Army and Disarmed by the Russian Police Force. The Military Authorities' News Agency Made the Following Remarks on This Information:</p>
<p>The Military Has Not Yet Received an Official Announcement, But Judging From the Circumstances, It May Be True. Because Outer Mongolia Has the Mongolian Independent Youth Party, and the Northeast Region is Difficult to Advance or Retreat Due to the Terrain, It Can Only Escape to Russia. If It Is Said That Russia Detained Them, It Is Difficult to Believe According to International Law. It Is Thought That They Are Disarmed and Protected. Moreover, According to International Law, It Is Not Possible to Ask the Soviet Russia to Extradite Su Bingwen, and Su's Life is Preserved Relying on This, and His Method is Really Admirable (6th Electric News Agency Telegram)</p>

As for the relaxation of the beer ban, according to Speaker of the House Garner, he will still urge its rapid progress to ensure its passage as soon as possible. The Senate opened today, held a prayer ceremony and a new senator oath ceremony, and then adjourned in mourning for the senators who died during the recess.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Hot Springs, Fifth Day - President-elect Roosevelt did not express any opinion on today's failure of the House of Representatives to pass the resolution to repeal the Prohibition Amendment. However, Democratic leaders who came here to discuss the issue with Roosevelt believe that Roosevelt will propose the case to a special session of Congress after taking office. According to sources in Washington, the special session of Congress, in view of the recent progress in national industry and commerce and the gradual decrease in unemployment, originally did not seem likely to be convened. However, due to the repeal of the Prohibition Amendment, it has been decided to convene it. It is also heard that the Democrats now believe that although the case failed to pass due to the lack of a two-thirds majority, the party's promise to the voters has already been fulfilled, and the matter can be handled again after the new congressmen are sworn in.</p>

<p>The U.S. government lodges a protest with the Spanish government to protect American commercial assets</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, Fifth Day - A serious diplomatic situation may arise between the United States and Spain. The Spanish Congress is currently discussing a government proposal to nationalize all telephone and telegraph services. However, the proposal does not include any provisions for compensation. The American International Telephone and Telegraph Company has laid long-distance telephone lines throughout Spain, as well as wireless communication with South America, and has established a telephone factory in Santander and a cable factory in Madrid, estimated to be worth 65 million gold dollars. Therefore, Under Secretary of State Castle today specifically told Spanish Ambassador Pierra that if the Spanish Congress passes the bill in its current form after the American International Telephone and Telegraph Company's assets are taken back, the United States will notify the Spanish government to demand full compensation for damages. If the Spanish government refuses to negotiate, the United States will not hesitate to withdraw its ambassador to Spain. Pierra replied that the Spanish president believes that this case is purely a domestic matter and does not involve the United States. Castle stated that the U.S. government believes that if American assets are confiscated anywhere, the government should negotiate on its behalf to obtain compensation. It is now heard that Pierra has telegraphed the U.S. government's attitude to his home country and is awaiting a reply.</p>

It is expected that the government will avoid impeachment by parliament and will adjourn the session until January of next year after several days of session.</p>

<p>England, America, France, and Italy Agreed on the Details of the American Plan</p>
<p>German Representative Asks for a Few Days to Respond</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, Sixth Day - Last night's dinner party by British Prime Minister MacDonald failed to yield any resolution from Germany. The British Prime Minister stated to German Foreign Minister Neurath that there was absolutely no anti-German united front. The German Foreign Minister asked for a few days to respond. This morning, the five major powers will have another meeting. French Premier Herriot is scheduled to return to Paris tonight, but can return to Geneva on Saturday or Sunday if necessary.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, Fifth Day - Whether the plan proposed by the United States, which is equivalent to a recess of the disarmament conference, can be accepted by Germany is currently an important issue. The United States advocates that all countries must sign a document before December 15th listing the principles that each country can agree to, such as the abolition of chemical and microbial warfare, restrictions on artillery and tanks, and the prohibition of aerial bombardment. If Germany accepts this proposal, a supervisory committee will be established to replace the disarmament conference to carry out designated tasks within a limited period. However, whether Germany will accept it is still undetermined, and there may be some opposition from the small countries. During the meeting today, representatives from England, France, America, and Italy have agreed on the details of the American plan, which is nearing completion but still awaits Germany's acceptance. British Prime Minister MacDonald invited the chief representatives of the countries concerned, such as German Foreign Minister Neurath, to a dinner party tonight. It is generally believed that the British Prime Minister will try to persuade Germany to accept the American plan.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, Fifth Day - Today, the British Prime Minister convened representatives from England, France, and Italy to discuss the disarmament issue. Shortly after, German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived here, and MacDonald temporarily excused the representatives to meet with Neurath alone. Tonight, the representatives of the major powers will hold a group meeting.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, Fifth Day - Tomorrow, representatives from England, France, America, and Italy will meet with German Foreign Minister Neurath to discuss the issue of the disarmament conference reconvening. Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald invited representatives from France, America, and Italy twice, in the morning and afternoon, to discuss the procedure for the talks with Neurath tomorrow. Today's talks were purely in the form of free expression of opinions, and the representatives did not make any decisions until tomorrow. Therefore, no conclusions were reached. According to reports, the disarmament conference has entered a stalemate since Germany withdrew. Davis's plan may be able to save it. The representatives are carefully considering the possible consequences of this plan. The French delegation does not seem to oppose the principles advocated by Davis, but only on the condition that the preliminary agreement does not harm security. However, what kind of reaction will the German side have if this plan is put into practice? If German Foreign Minister Neurath demands that all countries immediately guarantee equality of armaments, what will be the result? All of these are of great concern to the French delegation. After German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived here, he spoke with the British Prime Minister for an hour. Unofficial talks between the five countries' representatives (including the German representative) will begin tonight, as MacDonald has invited them to dinner at his residence tonight. The official meeting will continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, Fifth Day - The Japanese delegation to the Disarmament Conference recently formally submitted the Japanese naval proposal to French disarmament representative Poncet. According to reports, this proposal is part of Japan's qualitative disarmament plan, advocating reducing the offensive power of the navy and increasing its defensive power.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, Fifth Day - The Japanese delegation today notified the signatory countries of the Washington Disarmament Conference. Although the contents of the notification will not be made public until a few days later, according to those who know the contents, some of the treaties include reducing the tonnage of battleships from 35,000 tons to 15,000 tons, limiting or completely abolishing the number of aircraft carriers, and reserving 8-inch caliber guns for self-defense on all warships and submarines.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, Sixth Day - It is rumored that the talks between British Prime Minister MacDonald and German Foreign Minister Neurath last night have achieved some degree of reconciliation. Other sources claim that France, England, and the United States have agreed to postpone the disarmament conference for three years, and it is expected that Germany will also agree to shelve its demands for equality in disarmament during this period. This morning, German political circles claimed that Neurath never agreed to such a perfunctory approach and regretted that the Foreign Minister had been lured to Geneva only to confront the anti-German united front and promote the current situation in Europe according to France's wishes.</p>

In 1927, the cotton cultivation area was 2,005,250 acres, increasing to 3,814,750 acres in 1930, and further increasing to 5,870,500 acres in 1932. The Education Committee and Drama Society of Uzbekistan, the center of the cotton industry, have launched a drama competition to select a script depicting the Soviet cotton industry's independence from foreign supply.</p>
<p>Moscow, TASS - The total output of the Soviet oil industry in the first nine months of this year was 16,570,000 tons, compared to 22,300,000 tons in 1931, and only 9,200,000 tons in Old Russia in 1903. Oil has now become the most developed industry in the Soviet Union, with the opening of new oil fields increasing daily. The Bibi-Heybat Bay area in the Caspian Sea has been developed into a very rich oil field. The development of oil fields in Grozny, Maikop, and other places has also progressed. It is currently estimated that the Soviet Union contains 30% to 35% of the world's oil reserves and will inevitably develop into the world's leading oil producing country in the future. In recent years, the Soviet Union's investment in the oil industry has been considerable. Before the revolution, the Azneft refineries produced less than 3 million tons of oil, but by 1932, this had increased to 11.3 million tons. Grozny refined only 392,000 tons of oil in 1913, but this has now increased to 8 million tons. The percentage of oil extraction has also increased, from 2.7% for light oil in 1913 to 13.4% in 1932. The work of the Soviet oil industry has now been completely mechanized and electrified. The rotary drilling rig was invented by the Soviet engineer Kapelushnikov, and its drilling speed has increased from 30 to 40 meters per month in 1913 to 120 meters. Soviet oil merchants mainly supply domestic use, but exports have also increased two and a half times from 1926 to 1931.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The War Between Sichuan and Guizhou Provinces is Difficult to Stop <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan War: The Allied Forces Will Attack Chengdu</p>
<p>Guizhou War: Guiyang and Zunyi Are Both Fierce</p>
<p>Chongqing Airmail - The war situation in Sichuan Province currently seems to be tending towards quiescence, with battles on all fronts slowly advancing. The vanguard of the 20th Army has reached Jingyan and is confronting the 24th Army in Jiading, without any fierce battles. The six counties of Xuzhou Prefecture, Qingfu, Changning, Gaoxian, Gongxian, Xingwen, and Junlian, have been successively occupied by the 21st Army. On the other hand, the two divisions of the 20th Army, the Tang Division, have occupied Renshou and are confronting the 24th Army. In the Zizhong and Jianyang areas, the three divisions of Li Qixiang, Yang Sen, and Luo Zezhou are also advancing to assist Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao. They have reached Chadianchang and Longquanyi (60 li from Chengdu) and are confronting the 24th Army. The 28th and 29th Armies, which withdrew from Chengdu, are now concentrated in Xindu (40 li from Chengdu), Hanzhou (90 li from Chengdu), Jintang, Shifang, and other counties, with a total strength of 60,000 men. When Li Qixiang, Yang Sen, Luo Zezhou, and the 20th Army approach Chengdu, they will lead their troops to counterattack and join forces in Chengdu. The 24th Army of Liu Wenhui has concentrated 60,000 to 70,000 men in Chengdu, preparing to defend the city. It is reported that on the 1st of this month, Liu Wenhui sent a telegram to Liu Xiang, appealing to their familial ties and mutual interests, stating that at a time when the country is facing difficulties and the situation in Kangzang is tense, it is truly shameful and despised by the world, and a great disgrace to the Liu family, that we two uncles and nephews are engaged in civil war. Now that my nephew has obtained the southern Sichuan defense area, he should be content and stop the military action and no longer force his uncle to solve the Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao issue (it is said that Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui are both from the Baoding Military Academy. In this Sichuan war, Liu made many concessions to Deng, but Deng still raised troops to force him, so Liu was very angry and considered him an irreconcilable enemy). He further stated that he would lead his troops to be at his nephew's disposal, otherwise, his uncle would be forced to hand over his troops to Deng Xihou. In the future, if Deng Xihou's strength is sufficient, it will not be a blessing for his nephew either. Liu Xiang has not yet made any definite response. On the other hand, Tian Songyao also sent a telegram to Liu Xiang, saying, "The telegrams of truce and peace sent by the generals of the 24th, 28th, and 29th Armies are purely fabricated by Liu Wenhui. Songyao and Jin Kang have always stood on the side of the Allied Forces to jointly resolve the Sichuan situation. We are now concentrating our troops to prepare a counterattack and hope to join forces to take Chengdu." It is not yet known how Liu Xiang replied, but on the 30th of last month, Liu Xiang's planes dropped leaflets in Chengdu, ordering the people of Chengdu to evacuate beyond 20 li from the city within a week to avoid danger. It can be seen that the Allied Forces will join forces to attack Chengdu, which will become a reality, and the great battle will be on the Chengdu front in the future.</p>
<p>In Guizhou Province, after generals such as Che Mingyi and Jiang Zaizhen united and sent a joint telegram urging Wang Jialie to step down, hand over the provincial government, and for Mao Guangxiang to come out of retirement and resume his position as commander of the 25th Army, Wang Jialie was very angry and immediately sent the two independent brigades of Jian Wenbo and Li Chengzhang to attack the Third Division of Jiang Zaizhen stationed in Zunyi. Both sides fought fiercely at Wujiang, with each side suffering more than a thousand casualties. Vice Army Commander You Guocai then led his Second Division from Anshun and seized Guiyang by surprise. Wang Jialie, seeing the momentum was strong and difficult to resist, led his troops to withdraw from Guiyang and concentrated his forces in the vicinity to prepare for battle. First, he sent a telegram to You Guocai, expressing his willingness to cooperate jointly to manage the Guizhou situation. He was willing to hand over the position of chairman to You and combine the two forces to attack Jiang Zaizhen and Che Mingyi to stop Mao Guangxiang from resuming his position. You replied, proposing three conditions: 1. Wang Jialie must hand over the chairmanship and welcome Mao Guangxiang to resume his position. 2. Wang Jialie must hand over the command of the 25th Army to him, and he will hand over the position of vice army commander to Jiang Zaizhen or Che Mingyi. 3. Wang Jialie will serve as the commander of the training division and cooperate jointly, with other troops under the command of the commander of the 25th Army. Wang Jialie believed that You's conditions were too harsh and difficult to accept and refused. In recent days, the war situation on both sides of Guiyang and Wujiang has suddenly become fierce. The generals who supported Wang, such as He Zhiyong, Jian Wenbo, and Li Chengzhang, also sent a telegram supporting Wang's position as commander of the 25th Army and You Guocai's position as chairman, opposing Mao Guangxiang's return to power. Therefore, You had a tendency to soften. At the same time, Hou Zhidan, who was against Wang, was appointed by Liu Xiang of the 21st Army as the commander of the Guizhou-Sichuan border defense and expressed that he would not participate in the Guizhou war, but still urged Mao to come out of retirement and govern, based on his original intention of opposing Wang and supporting Mao. Jiang Zaizhen, Che Mingyi, Song Xing, and Hou Yujiu had disputes over the distribution of positions after the overthrow of Wang Jialie. Jiang and Che both wanted to be the commander of the 25th Army, while Song wanted the training division, and Hou coveted the First Division. He Zhiyong's troops, therefore, caused the anti-Wang group to split. Wang Jialie saw this situation and thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so he transferred He Zhiyong's First Division, stationed in Hongjiang, to concentrate in Guiyang to counterattack, and ordered Jian Wenbo and Li Chengzhang to attack Jiang Zaizhen fiercely in order to fight for the final victory. The Guizhou affairs are still in chaos, and there is no hope of a solution for the time being (November 3rd).</p>
<p>Puppet Discrimination Against Foreigners</p>
<h3 id="e65">Foreigners Feel They Cannot Establish Themselves in Manchuria, Very Difficult to Import Goods <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News, Harbin Correspondence, November 22nd - Lately, foreigners in Manchuria have been subjected to discrimination. Mr. Sugihara, the Japanese representative of the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry stationed in Harbin, said to the representative of the local Russian newspaper that the Changchun government has decided that all foreigners, including those with consular jurisdiction, will not be allowed to enter the country unless their passports have been properly visaed by the "Manchukuo" government. Previously, foreigners arriving without a visa were only warned, but from now on, they must comply with the passport regulations before being allowed to enter the country. Regarding this matter, an American recently held a passport and requested the Japanese Consulate in this city to visa it in order to return to his country via Japan, but was refused. The reason given was that it had not been visaed by the "Manchukuo" authorities, and it was claimed that this was at the request of the "Manchukuo" authorities. In fact, the two sides are one and the same. It is evident that the purpose of these two incidents is to force the recognition of various countries. This kind of coercion is now common. Foreign businessmen are being subjected to differential treatment and have little chance of competing with Japanese businessmen, who are given priority in everything. Currently, the customs offices no longer post notices in English. According to customs officials, they can only publish notices in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, and refuse to send notices to merchants, saying that they can read Russian newspapers. Furthermore, inland navigation is completely monopolized by Japanese transportation companies. The South Manchuria Railway also only provides various conveniences to Japanese merchants. In addition, the Vladivostok line is now completely blocked, making it very difficult for British, American, and German merchants to transport goods into Manchuria. In short, it is still a long way off for foreign businessmen to have good hopes for trade in Manchuria.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Li Division Stationed in Xuzhou Transferred to Yichang <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Xu Tingyao's Division Takes Over Defense of Xuzhou</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence - The Ninth Division, commanded by Division Commander Li Yiannian, has been defending the area around Xubu and Dangshan. Now, Division Commander Li has received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordering his troops to go to Hubei to defend Yichang and the western Hubei area. After Liu Xiang's troops returned to Sichuan, the vacant defense urgently needs to be filled, and the banditry along the Yangtze River should also be guarded against. As for the Xu defense, the Fourth Division, commanded by Division Commander Xu Tingyao, has been ordered to send a unit to take over the defense. After receiving the order, Li immediately notified the Jinpu Railway to prepare 13 trains for transportation. On the morning of the 5th, the independent brigade of the Fourth Division, commanded by Guan Linzheng, arrived in Xubu. The Ninth Division also began to go south on the empty trains that day. According to the plan, the Ninth Division was scheduled to send four trains on the 5th for the 26th Brigade, commanded by Zheng Zuomin, and the replenishment regiment, commanded by Wu Bin. Four trains were scheduled to be sent on the 7th for the division headquarters and direct subordinate units. Four trains were scheduled to be sent on the 9th for the 25th Brigade, commanded by Li Xiangrong. Finally, a train of baggage cars will be sent to complete the transportation. All trains will be transferred at Pukou and go directly to Yichang. Li Yiannian is scheduled to leave Xuzhou on the 6th and go south. This morning (the 5th), he invited representatives from all walks of life to a farewell gathering at the garrison headquarters, attended by 20 or 30 heads of various groups and institutions. Li reported that the division's stationing in Xuzhou has been deeply supported by the local people, and he is ashamed of not having made any achievements. In recent months, the division has paid special attention to the suppression of drugs, knowing that the spread of drugs is infinitely harmful and can be exploited by the communists. After the division leaves Xuzhou, he still hopes that all sectors of society will work hard to eliminate drugs and that they will be able to unite and govern themselves. The Fourth Division stationed in Xuzhou will be the same as the Ninth Division, cooperating with local construction. It should be known that no matter which army is stationed in which area, they all hope to make achievements and implement the purpose of mutual assistance between the army and the people. The representatives also made speeches in reply, and then dispersed after tea and refreshments. As for the Fourth Division troops arriving in Xuzhou, the cavalry regiment arrived at dawn this morning (the 5th) and immediately transferred to Dangshan so that the Ninth Division troops stationed there could depart. Independent Brigade Commander Guan Linzheng then led the brigade headquarters to arrive in Xuzhou by train at 7:00 this morning. Guan got off the train and temporarily stayed at the Oriental Hotel. According to Guan's conversation, the brigade was stationed in Fengyang after suppressing bandits in northern Anhui. Now it is ordered to open to Xuzhou. He boarded the train at Mentai zi and went north. Division Commander Xu is still guarding the Jinpu southern section along the line in Bengbu. The line is currently very peaceful, and the bandit areas in northern Anhui have also gradually recovered their former appearance. The brigade will continue to depart north on six trains and will be transported to completion that day. It is said that Guan plans to move to the police headquarters and city defense after Li Yiannian leaves, and Guan has sent a team to take over the post (5th).</p>
<h3 id="e67">Closing Arguments in Hu Lifu Case, Sentencing Set for 12th <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court heard the traitor Hu Lifu case at 2:00 p.m. today (the 6th). There were many people in the audience. Judge Hu Shangu, the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Tribunal, judges Zhang Bingci and Zhao Zongzhou, Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo, and Clerk 丨 Mou were in the First Criminal Tribunal to hear the case. Lawyer Wang Jian appeared in court to defend Hu. Witness Cheng Wenyan, the Chief Inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, did not arrive. The arguments concluded and sentencing was set for the 12th. Hu cried during the signing and requested further investigation. A detailed record of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>At around 1:00 p.m. today, Hu Lifu was first brought from the prison to the High Court and sat upright in the criminal waiting room, looking very relaxed. At 2:00 p.m., Hu Shangu, judge of the Second Criminal Tribunal, judges Zhang Bingci and Zhao Zongzhou, Prosecutor Shi Wenzhuo, and Clerk 丨 and others ascended to the First Court. (Question) Hu, what is your age, place of origin, and address? (Answer) 52 years old, Yongjia, Zhejiang, originally lived in Miaotou, Pengpu Town, later moved to Weihaiwei Road. (Question) When did you move there? (Answer) Around the January 28th Incident. (Question) What is your occupation? (Answer) I opened the Hecheng Tanning and Hydrating Factory on Binlang Road. (Question) How did you know Washizaki? (Answer) He is an engineer in the factory. (Question) How many years have you employed him? (Answer) Four years already. (Question) How is your relationship? (Answer) Not bad. (Question) Is the factory still open? (Answer) It is closed. (Question) Why is it closed? (Answer) Because of the January 28th Incident. (Question) Where did Washizaki go? (Answer) He moved to Hongkou. (Question) What was the situation with the Maintenance Association? (Answer) After the 19th Route Army defended the second line, around March 2nd or 3rd, my house was robbed and looted, and robberies occurred everywhere else. The people were in deep water and could not escape the disaster, so I organized the Maintenance Association to maintain order in the area. (Question) How many items were robbed from your house? (Answer) There were more than 40 leather suitcases. When I returned home, people nearby said that this place had been occupied by the Japanese army, and I could not escape. (Question) What happened later? (Answer) I went to see which army it was (Hu sobbed and could not speak), knowing it was the Japanese army, but there were dead bodies piled up everywhere, and some people were miserable and could not escape. So I organized the Maintenance Association. (Question) What did the Japanese think? (Answer) They also agreed and found a few assistants to organize the Northern District Maintenance Association. The work was quite successful because there were often refugees fleeing to the concession, and we protected them. (Question) So the meaning of organizing this association was the Japanese's meaning? (Answer) It was not the meaning of the merchants, it was the meaning of the people. (Question) There were Japanese people present at the time, how could it be the meaning of the merchants? (Answer) It was all lies from the Public Security Bureau and the newspapers. (Question) When was the Northern District Maintenance Association established? (Answer) It was established on April 1st. (Question) Did you get permission from the Japanese? (Answer) No, but I notified them. (Question) Did you report to the Municipal Government and the Chamber of Commerce? (Answer) I did report. (Question) How did you report it? (Answer) By official letter. (Question) When did you send the official letter? (Answer) I forgot the date. (Question) Organizing a Maintenance Association must be approved by the Municipal Government before it can be organized. According to you, it is an illegal organization. (Answer) When I reported it, the Municipal Government had already issued an arrest warrant, so there was no approval reply. (Question) The court has already investigated that there was no such thing as reporting to the Municipal Government and the Chamber of Commerce. At this point, the judge showed Hu the letter from the Municipal Government to the High Court and said that the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report that this illegal organization immediately sent personnel to investigate secretly. After the report, Mayor Wu sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang in Nanjing. (Question) In short, in the enemy-occupied area, the association could not be established without the enemy's permission, and without the approval of the Municipal Government, the illegal attitude of the organization was very obvious. (Answer) That is Chinese territory, and there were disaster victims everywhere, with piles of corpses, and bandits took the opportunity to loot. The goods in the warehouses in Zhabei were worth tens of millions of dollars. If we didn't organize a Maintenance Association, not only would the people's property be looted, but the corpses would not be collected and buried in the warm weather at that time, which would be a great hindrance to hygiene. What's more, I witnessed the Chinese being humiliated by the Japanese. (Question) According to Telegram No. from the Shanghai Municipal Government, you were the chairman of the Northern District Citizens Maintenance Association, Wang Du was the vice chairman. The association was divided into six groups, with the Japanese Washizaki and Yokota as directors of the General Affairs Group, Vice Chairman Wang Du concurrently serving as director of the Finance Group, Chang Yuqing as director of the Patrol Police Group, Cheng Xiangbai as director of the Transportation Group, Yao Zhirui as director of the Investigation Group, and 丨 Qingyuan as director of the Hygiene Group, with 150 policemen under the command of Chang Yuqing and 50 detectives. (Answer) Wang Du escaped after a few days, and the rest of the organization and so on were all exaggerated by the newspapers. In fact, they did not understand the situation in the North District. (Question) The Municipal Government's telegram to Nanjing cannot be fabricated. (Question)</p>
<p>Did you hear him speak in English? (Answer) Yes. At this point, the officer read out Hu's statement to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. (Question) When was the Maintenance Association dissolved? (Answer) April 11th. (Question) Was it because the League of Nations intervened and the Japanese army dissolved the Maintenance Association? (Answer) No, we stopped doing it ourselves. (Question) When were you arrested? (Answer) August 16th. I was arrested at the Xin Yanlou restaurant on North Sichuan Road. There were many detectives secretly hiding with guns. I asked them if they had official business. They said they didn't care. At that time, everyone thought I was a Japanese traitor, and it was useless to argue. I went with them. I was being attacked on all sides because the Japanese also hated me. (Question) What was the name of the commander of the Fourth Battalion of the Japanese army? (Answer) His name was Yamashita. The commander-in-chief was Uematsu. (Question) What about Yokota and Washizaki? (Answer) They were interpreters for the Japanese. (Question) Did the Fourth Battalion come to investigate? (Answer) They came to investigate. (Question) It can be seen that it was organized according to the Japanese. (Answer) It was organized according to the Chinese, and it was a charitable organization. (Question) You once confessed that you were doing things according to the Fourth Battalion, but sometimes you had to do things according to your own. (Answer) No, I didn't. (Question) So you were appointed by the Japanese? (Answer) I was not appointed by the Japanese. I didn't set fires or loot. It was entirely a charitable organization. (Question) You also said that there were hundreds of people in the association during the investigation. (Answer) They were coolies because they were moving goods from the warehouses. (Question) In any case, why didn't you ask the government for approval? (Answer) Judge, please be aware that it takes a long time for the government to handle things. If we waited for approval, the area would have been ruined long ago. Don't we want our Chinese territory? The government didn't take care of it, so how can you blame us? (Question) You collected more than 3,000 yuan in taxes during the 10 days of the Maintenance Association's existence? (Answer) There was no so-called taxation. It was voluntary donations. (Question) You estimated the value of the goods and collected 2%? (Answer) No, otherwise I would have been detained for three or four months. Why didn't they come to accuse me earlier? (Question) Were the donation tickets issued by you? (Answer) They were just certificates for the circulation of goods. (Question) Did you receive a salary as chairman? (Answer) None at all, not even a penny. (Question) What kind of goods were transported out? (Answer) Kerosene, etc., were all things from the warehouses. (Question) The Japanese army estimated that Zhabei needed supplies, so you established this association to serve them. (Answer) No, the Japanese army sent many male and female inspectors at that time, distributing them at various intersections. Women had to be stripped and checked when entering and exiting, which damaged the national integrity. For the sake of the overall national integrity, I was absolutely not serving the Japanese. Moreover, the association was organized after the January 28th Incident, not before, so it was not serving the Japanese. (Question) So what was the purpose of the detectives and police? (Answer) There really weren't any. Otherwise, when I was escorted to Nanjing, wouldn't I have been shot immediately? I am a law-abiding businessman. My hair is already white and I have grandchildren. Why would I do anything illegal? (Question) What about the Yunhe Company? (Answer) I didn't ask or hear about the Yunhe Company. (Question) Who organized the company? (Answer) It was organized by Yokota. (Question) The Yunhe Company opened opium dens, sold opium, gambled, and collected commissions? (Answer) All of them are destructive. It only provides insurance and collects rent for others as its business. (Question) Your case has been thoroughly investigated by the authorities. (Answer) They are all lies fabricated by the detectives. (Question) Why would they fabricate rumors about you? (Answer) Because there are vested interests. (Question) It is conceivable that you have done such a thing. (Answer) The situation is opaque and I cannot publish a statement in the newspaper. (Question) Cheng Ruowen, also known as Zheng Yiyuan, of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, met you and knew that you were divided into several groups and established branches. The association had more than 20 staff members, and there were 20 or 30 long-term police officers. The Hongzhen branch was dissolved when the Japanese army was about to withdraw. The Yunhe Company was opened and collected more than 9,000 yuan. Do you understand? (Answer) It is a matter of my conscience. Why didn't I take the opportunity to rob? I was really doing it for the local people. (Question) Is the pistol yours? (Answer) It has a passport number from the National Government and the Municipal Government, number 27147. (Question) Liang, the director of the Shanghai Finance Bureau's donation collection, issued an investigation. According to the report of Li Jiqing, a patrol officer of the former Fourth District Public Security Bureau (the location of the Maintenance Association), two policemen with guns were guarding the area. (Answer) They were watchmen. At this point, the officer repeatedly stated that organizing a group in the Japanese-occupied area without government approval was illegal. Hu replied that he remembered that when the French territory was occupied by Germany, the French also came out to maintain order. In short, the people now hate the Japanese deeply, so they hate me. Hu Lifu said that I am a traitor, but the people will not hate me if they know the inside story. At this point, the judge asked if there was anything to say. Hu begged the judge to judge according to fair law. Even if I die, I will not complain. If my crime is not deserved, then please release me on bail to avoid suffering more. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Case of the Arrest of Demon Bandits in Jinan <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Yesterday morning (the 4th), the Special Operations Team of the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital of Jinan arrested the self-proclaimed Demon Bandit Pseudo-Emperor Li Lechuan, the Pseudo-Empress Song Wangshi, and the Pseudo-Earth Emperor Fu Baoqi at No. 124 Houyingfang. In addition, the carpenter Zhi Huaqing was arrested on Zhengjue Temple Street. More than 30 items such as imperial carriages, spirit tablets, and wooden oxen were found, along with three wooden boxes and one wicker package containing dragon robes and other imperial garments. The Public Security Bureau's Judicial Section conducted an interrogation that same evening and transferred them to the Provincial Government, where Chairman Han will review the case. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Emperor Li Lechuan is from Lucheng, 140 li southwest of Linyi County, and is 40 years old with no profession. Song Wangshi, the Pseudo-Empress, is 53 years old and from Anjiazhuang, Linyi County. She is Li's cousin (it is said that her husband, Song Qizeng, once served as the Prefect of Yangzhou and is skilled in incantations and spirit writing). The Pseudo-Earth Emperor Fu Baoqi is a tailor from Linyi who resides at No. 124 Houyingfang in this city. Recently, they had wild ideas and exploited the ignorance and corrupt thinking of the villagers to create rumors and incite people. They claimed to be acting under Heaven's mandate as the True Emperor. Song Wangshi also used witchcraft such as incantations and spirit writing to deceive the villagers, claiming that she was a disciple of a certain Buddha who had descended to earth to relieve suffering. Many ignorant women were deceived by her. Therefore, they carried out activities on a large scale. On the one hand, they contacted the Red Spear Society and others in various counties in southern Shandong to spread their influence. On the other hand, they secretly raised funds from various places in the name of offerings, and quite a few people were deceived. According to the donation records found, the amount of donations has reached millions. Li and others then secretly enjoyed the imperial system, establishing the pseudo-regime of "Later Qing". Li Lechuan called himself the "Emperor." The puppet organization of Manchuria also sent so-called "Imperial Envoys" to Linyi to secretly collude with him, attempting to disrupt Shandong. With external support, the Li bandits became even more active, appointing the Liu sisters, Fifth and Sixth, from the county as the Pseudo-East and West Palaces, and also assigning prime ministers and other pseudo-officials, planning to launch an uprising on the third day of the third month of next year. For a time, many ignorant villagers in various counties in southern Shandong were lured by them, and their potential power was quite significant. Later, Li Lechuan, fearing that the situation in Linyi was too sensitive and that there might be accidents, secretly traveled to Jinan with his cousin Song Wangshi (i.e., the Pseudo-Empress) in June and stayed at the home of the Pseudo-Earth Emperor Chen Baoqi at No. 124 Houyingfang, still secretly carrying out all activities. When the Provincial Government learned of this, it ordered Liu Yaoting, the captain of the Special Operations Team of the Public Security Bureau, to be responsible for the investigation. After receiving the order, Liu Yaoting sent many officers to secretly investigate. Because Li's organization was extremely strict, it took several months to fully understand everything. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Kairu, reported this, and at 7:00 am yesterday morning, Liu Yaoting personally led the police team to surround Fu Baoqi's residence in Houyingfang, arresting the Pseudo-Later Qing Emperor Li Lechuan, the Pseudo-Empress Song Wangshi, and the Pseudo-Earth Emperor Fu Baoqi on the spot. Another self-proclaimed "Human Emperor" escaped. In addition, the carpenter Zhi Huaqing and others (i.e., those who made the wooden oxen and other pseudo-artifacts) were arrested on Zhengjue Temple Street, totaling four people. Zhi is 36 years old and from Changqing. During the search of the Fu and Zhi residences, the so-called full set of ceremonial guard instruments was found, including door knives, elephant nose knives, longevity swords, sun, moon, stars, 　, fingers, hands, fists, palms, golden hooks, axes, Chao Tian Cheng, and more than 30 other items. There was also a spirit tablet building, with two dragons spitting whiskers and fully engraved with the character "王" (king) on yellow silk, and a wooden ox with four wheels, each embroidered with the character "王" (king) on its forehead and upper lip. In addition, there were three wooden boxes and one wicker package containing dragon robes, phoenix gold crowns, and other items. There were also many stationery items and a donation record book from various places. The Special Operations Team Captain Liu Yaoting took all the criminals and pseudo-artifacts to the Special Operations Team for interrogation. Li Lechuan and others confessed to all the above facts. They were then transferred to the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau at 8:00 pm and then transferred to the Provincial Government for Chairman Han to personally interrogate. However, several commissioners sent by the pseudo-organization and the Liu sisters of the Pseudo-East and West Palaces are still under investigation. According to reports, in the autumn of the 17th year, Ma Qiwei from Changqing County claimed to be the emperor and caused trouble in Zhoucun. After the army went to suppress and captured many people, Ma escaped. Now there is Li Lechuan, which can be said to be no coincidence. It can be seen that the minds of ordinary ignorant people are still anesthetized by the imperial system of thousands of years. This is also a hidden worry for the country and society.

<p>The Qingpu Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank had rice pawning facilities two years ago to help farmers. This year, Qing County has a bumper harvest of rice, and the price of rice has plummeted as a result, causing great losses to poor farmers. Moreover, it is currently the period for paying rent, and farmers are in urgent need of money. Therefore, the bank started pawning rice in Rihejiang on the 3rd of this month.

<p>Cao, from Beizhen, Baihejiang, has a daughter who is hot-tempered and not unattractive. She married Yang from the same town. At first, the couple was quite harmonious. Since she became acquainted with Yang Hancha, who lives next door to Cao's family and serves as the deputy head of the town's security regiment, she suddenly became restless and secretly met with him under the guise of shopping. Her parents ordered her to return home, but she threatened to commit suicide. A month ago, her father died, and the two have been living together as a couple. However, Hancha's family is wealthy and happy, and his wife is ugly and very fierce. Knowing their secret, she hated them very much. One night this month, seeing her husband enter Cao's house, she waited outside the door for about two hours. When Cao's daughter came out, his wife stepped forward and caught the two of them. She fully intended to make a scene, but the two begged her in every way and promised not to do it again, so she let them go. Yang then submitted a petition requesting a divorce and compensation for the loss. After mediation by various parties, Hancha paid Yang more than 400 yuan as a marriage fee, and the matter was settled. However, after the divorce, Cao's daughter went to Hancha's house every day to make trouble, insisting on entering as a concubine. Because of his fierce wife, he dared not agree to her request and is currently arguing, unable to resolve the matter.</p>

<p>This year's autumn harvest is abundant, but the price of rice has fallen tragically, which has had a major impact on the rural economy in various places. The Jiangsu Provincial Jinghu Food Regulation Association has repeatedly held meetings and decided to set up public warehouses to handle agricultural loans.

Recently, it has been decided to establish five locations first: 1. Dongting Town in the tenth district; 2. Anzhen in the eighth district; 3. Shitou Town in the fifth district; 4. Qianqiao Town in the fourth district; 5. Nanqiao Town in the third district. The above five locations started lending and accepting collateral yesterday. The collateral is stipulated to be rice, wheat, beans, and native cloth, mortgaged at 60% of the value of the goods, with a monthly interest rate of 1%, plus a storage fee. The term is temporarily set at one year. When mortgaging, the local township chief must provide proof and guarantee to ensure thoroughness. The protection problem will be handled by the police and business groups in each township.</p>

<p>The manpower-powered rickshaw pullers in our city went on strike on the 1st of this month because they demanded that the owners reduce the rent of the rickshaws. Some of them were forced to resume work two days later but were stopped by the public. As a result, it has been four days since then. Some rickshaw pullers had no way to make a living and pawned their clothes and belongings, but it was still difficult to maintain themselves. They were in a dilemma. On the morning of the 5th, one or two people were forced by livelihood to try to pull rickshaws and no one stopped them. As a result, more and more people dragged rickshaws, and by 4:00 pm, no one stopped, and the entire group resumed work. Seeing this situation, the owners had pity on the workers and decided to convene a meeting of all the rickshaw owners on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss the reduction of rent.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, given Su Bingwen's unit and others' retreat after being cut off from assistance, has specifically cabled the National Government and various agencies requesting swift relief. The original cable reads: "To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, jointly received and overseen. The telegram from Su Bingwen and others suddenly reveals that this army, oppressed by the enemy's superior weaponry, has retreated into Russian territory, with a populace of 4,000 stranded in a foreign land. Though this event is unfortunate, it is exceedingly heartbreaking. Nevertheless, this solitary army has fought hard and endured myriad difficulties. Despite the disparity in strength and the ultimate defeat, their valiant deeds are to be honored. Every soldier and horse, they must be viewed as loyal and courageous men, deserving of proper accommodation and care. This is an unshirkable responsibility. It is requested that this original cable be swiftly and judiciously reviewed and swiftly grant relief so that they can return home, hoping to emulate this in the future. This is not only the urgent desire of the officers and soldiers of this army but also concerns the morale of all armies of the Northeast Volunteer Army. This telegram calls for attention, hoping for understanding and consideration."

<h3 id="e90">The Volunteer Army Transportation Corps Cables Requesting Determined Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Cable to the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>With the Third Plenary Session scheduled to be held in mid-month, the Northeast Volunteer Army Transportation Corps specifically cabled all members of the session yesterday, requesting that they advocate for determined resistance against Japan in order to achieve the goal of recovering lost territory and expelling the violent Japanese from the country. The original cable reads: "To all members of the Third Plenary Session of Nanjing, all of you are aware of the rampant and escalating tyranny of Japanese imperialism, which is the result of our government's deliberate reliance on the League of Nations and lack of resolve to resist. Now, the weakness of the League of Nations' inability has been fully exposed; not only is it unable to sanction violent Japan, but it also seeks to place our Northeast territory under international co-management. Moreover, the treacherous schemes of imperialism in international affairs are emerging one after another, first by promoting a Japanese-Russian alliance to restrain the United States and France, and then by expanding military power to threaten the League of Nations. Amidst this treacherous international situation, our authorities, apart from sending two or three representatives to attend the League of Nations to engage in verbal battles, have made no other preparations. The dangers ahead are truly unbearable to mention. However, the reason why tens of counties in the Northeast have not yet changed color and the people have not become slaves of a conquered nation is due to the strength of the Northeast anti-Japanese armies. Now, the Northeast anti-Japanese armies are suffering from a lack of clothing, ammunition, and food, and are also under the general offensive of the Japanese army. The plenary session should seek to provide practical assistance to these patriotic men. The purpose of the team's organization is to provide practical assistance to the people. If the government is to recover the lost territory in the Northeast by force, it should rely on a massive armed force as the basis for recovering the lost territory in the Northeast. Rehe is the gateway to North China, a natural stronghold that has been repeatedly reported to be under strain since mid-July. For the sake of preserving North China and recovering the lost territory in the Northeast, the plenary session should urgently order the government to swiftly dispatch heavy troops to garrison in order to maintain the advantageous position of being able to defend and attack. The above-mentioned views are necessary conditions for determined resistance against Japan. Therefore, we cable requesting that you members deeply study this with the eye of a revolutionary, establish the greatest determination and conviction, advocate for determined resistance against Japan, and adopt thorough and appropriate methods to cope with the current crisis. The nation's survival depends on leading the people to fight against the violent Japanese. This telegram is sent for your consideration."</p>

<p>Hindering the National Salvation Movement</p>
<p>A Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment Should Be Requested</p>
<p>The New Sound Society reports that during the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout troop's charity performance to raise funds for Northeastern refugees, while selling tickets in the Baoshan Road area, police officer number 2729 from the 1st Section of the 5th District, obstructed them because he was unable to obtain free tickets. The society was extremely indignant upon hearing this and has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting strict punishment for the officer as a warning to others. The letter states: "To the esteemed Public Security Bureau, in order to provide relief to Northeastern refugees who have taken up arms, our society has initiated a fundraising charity performance and, starting on the 1st of this month, instructed the Boy Scout troop to sell tickets door-to-door in order to raise substantial funds for relief efforts. We have previously submitted this to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record and requested that your bureau instruct your subordinates to provide protection. Now, according to the ticket sales department, at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, when the Boy Scouts went to the Baoshan Road area to sell tickets, a police officer number 2729 from the 1st Section of the 5th District came forward and forcibly demanded tickets. After the Boy Scouts politely explained that the tickets were all for donations to Northeastern refugees and could not be given away, the police officer left in a huff. The next day, the Boy Scouts returned to the same area to sell tickets, but the police officer obstructed them, spreading the word to various shops not to buy the tickets, and even took the Boy Scouts to the 1st Section of the 5th District, ordering them to stop selling tickets. Our society cannot bear the loss of our national territory, so we are speaking out for the Northeastern refugees who have taken up arms and initiating a charity performance. Any person with breath and blood who is not insane should strive to promote the spirit of national salvation and support this righteous cause. Although your bureau, constrained by regulations, cannot actively protect the Boy Scouts' ticket sales, it should certainly not prohibit or obstruct them. Whether or not to purchase tickets should be left to the conscience of the citizens. However, the police officer, harboring resentment for not obtaining free tickets, went so far as to obstruct this city-wide national salvation movement, acting in a contradictory and ignorant manner. Therefore, we specially request that your bureau swiftly conduct a thorough investigation and impose strict punishment as a warning to others. We eagerly await your response. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e100">Kim Cheol's Heartrending Conversation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Eternal Farewell to the Three Hans (Korea)</p>
<p>Afraid of Becoming a Double Colonial Slave</p>
<p>The New Sound Society reports that Kim Cheol and his son, naturalized Koreans who were arrested by the Japanese after they illegally entered the French Concession, have left Shanghai for elsewhere. Before leaving, Kim expressed his indignation to his friends. His lawyer, Wu Kaisheng, has decided on a course of action for negotiations, which are detailed below.</p>
<p>Kim Cheol was escorted out of Shanghai by his friends. The car was equipped with two self-defense guns in case of a Japanese attack, intending to fight to the death and perish together. One of his friends returned to Shanghai yesterday and told the reporter about Kim Cheol's conversation, which roughly stated: "I am a Korean who has been engaged in the restoration movement since the fall of my country. I have repeatedly failed, but this is not the first time. I always feel that China and Korea are brothers in history and interdependent in geography. If the younger brother dies, the elder brother will be defeated, like the loss of lips and the coldness of teeth. The Japanese want to destroy China, they must first destroy Korea. If Korea is destroyed, China will not be safe. Discerning people can see this. The Qing Dynasty figures like Zhang Peilun and Li Hongzhang all foresaw this, but unfortunately Empress Dowager Cixi did not use their strategies. If the Chinese people had aided the Korean restoration earlier, it would have been successful, and there would have been no incident in the Eastern Provinces. Because my patriotic work was difficult to produce results, I naturalized as a Chinese citizen in 1929, just like Li Ling said, 'Born as an extraordinary person, dying as a ghost in a foreign land,' bidding an eternal farewell to the Three Hans. Who would have thought that the Japanese would have the September 18th Incident last year and the January 28th Incident this year? I lament my misfortune, already a colonial slave of Korea, I will become a colonial slave of China. If China falls, the Chinese people will be a single colonial slave, while I will be a double colonial slave. What life experience could be more bitter than this?" At this point, his friend wept, and Kim also shed tears. He continued, "My anti-Japanese movement has a long history, and I am very familiar with many comrades in China and Korea. This time, being sold out was unexpected and was caused by my son Kim Cheol-nyeon being young, inexperienced, and overly enthusiastic. My acquaintance with Huang Zhanying was only last year. At that time, Huang was with Lawyer Wu Chengyu for a long time, and because I trusted Mr. Wu, I suffered this misfortune. Now I have suffered torture, but fortunately, I am still alive. This ambition will not change. My life was ended by the Japanese on the 30th of last month. The Kim Cheol from now on can be said to be a new life. Someone newly out of the gate is not afraid of death. I will tread on the bloodstains of the martyrs of China and Korea and move forward. I deeply hope to tell Chinese comrades to work together." The reporter visited Lawyer Wu Kaisheng, who is handling the case yesterday.</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Kaisheng's Investigation</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu is paying close attention to this case and has decided on three measures: 1) Request the Municipal Government and the French Consul to negotiate with the Japanese Consul to prevent the Japanese from illegally arresting naturalized Chinese citizens in the French Concession in the future. 2) Request the French Consul to protect the safety of Chinese citizens and all naturalized foreigners in the French Concession, even if they commit criminal offenses, they must be dealt with according to legal procedures. 3) Demand a prompt response to Lawyer Cai's request for the return of Kim Cheol's belongings. He will do his utmost to achieve a satisfactory outcome to protect the safety of naturalized citizens.</p>

<p>Personnel Must Be Sent to Participate in the Material Purchase Committee</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund has approved the Ministry of Railways' request for a loan, but the contract has not yet been signed. According to sources, during the meeting, the British Deputy Chairman, Mr. Massy, noted that the Huai River Conservancy Commission had previously borrowed funds from the fund for river management but had not yet repaid them. Therefore, he proposed that the Ministry of Railways' purchase of materials with this loan must be stamped with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund symbol for identification and to clarify the debt. After discussion, it was resolved that in the future, the Ministry of Railways must submit detailed lists of materials purchased in Britain to the Board of Directors for review, and all equipment and materials must be stamped with the society's symbol next to the manufacturer's mark. Furthermore, the Board of Directors will send a representative to participate in the Material Purchase Committee. It is also reported that the loan contract stipulates that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway must be completed within three years.</p>

<p>Reporting on the War Situation and Requesting Relief</p>
<p>The Cavalry First Route Headquarters of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army recently sent Mr. Zhen Daitian, Chief of Staff of the unit, to Shanghai to contact the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association for relief. Mr. Zhen arrived in Shanghai yesterday and went to the association to make contact and convey the unit's official letter, which reads: "To the Esteemed Gentlemen, since the Northeast Incident, our unit has been fighting against the violent Japanese in various places in western Liaoning for many years, enduring hardship, but remembering the loss of our motherland, we have done our best to fulfill our national duty and dare not complain of labor. Therefore, every time we fight hard against the Japanese bandits, our officers and soldiers do their best. The last time we joined forces with friendly units to occupy Tongliao, we killed countless enemies. Now that winter is approaching and the weather outside the Great Wall is extremely cold, our tens of thousands of soldiers are still wearing single clothes, and we have no ammunition or food. At this time of utter desperation, we have no choice but to ask our compatriots for help. We have long known that you gentlemen of your esteemed association have a long-standing love for the country and are generous in relieving suffering. At this time when 30 million people in the Northeast are in deep water and dire straits, and hundreds of thousands of territories have changed color, there must be sufficient relief. Therefore, we have specially sent Mr. Zhen Daitian, Chief of Staff of our unit, as a representative of all comrades in our unit, to go to Shanghai to plead for help from all walks of life. We sincerely hope that you gentlemen will consider the fragmentation of our rivers and mountains and the suffering of our comrades-in-arms. The isolated army outside the Great Wall is waiting to die. We still beg you to donate widely and collect small amounts to make a large sum. It is easy to hold up a crowd, and it is good to have more and more. Our unit vows to fight the Japanese bandits to the end, and even if there is only one soldier left, we will not be ashamed of being an ally under the city. We earnestly hope that our compatriots and gentlemen will consider the plight and lend a helping hand. The Relief Association is said to be planning to find ways to merge the unit with other units and consider relief measures.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Guowen News Agency received reliable information that China Business Company did pay 700,000 yuan in silver dollars when mortgaging at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, all in checks totaling 14 sheets. The so-called owner of the 700,000 yuan was found by the government to be the former Superintendent Chen Fumu. It is heard that China Business Company is quite thorny about this matter because the mortgage contract signed by Chen and Li does not mention the 700,000 yuan. Therefore, if this huge sum of money is to be returned, it will not be possible without meeting the recipient. Although Chen Fumu has been summoned by our judicial organs many times, he has not yet appeared in court. It is definitely asked that an arrest warrant will be issued within a week to arrest him to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Northeast Righteous Army Support Association received 2,000 yuan in national currency remitted by the Overseas Chinese Charity Association of Old Java. The association sent a reply letter of thanks yesterday. The original letter reads:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, according to a letter from the Shanghai Hefeng Bank on November 29, we learned that your association donated 2,000 yuan in national currency to the Northeast Righteous Army, which has been transferred to our association for relief. The bank has already recorded it in the register and sent the donation receipt directly to your association. Your enthusiasm for saving the country is deeply appreciated. The total number of Righteous Armies in the Northeast is no less than 500,000. In Liaoning, Zhu Qinglan and Zhu Jiqing are responsible respectively. In Jilin, there are the self-defense forces and national salvation armies of Ji Chao, Li Du, Wang Delin, Feng Zhanhai, etc. In Heilongjiang, only the troops of General Zhan Shan were under command, but now there are the national salvation armies of Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu, which control a large area of Heilongjiang Province. The above-mentioned troops are all the first to receive relief from our association. The current cash is about 200,000 yuan, and 4,000-5,000 cotton-padded clothes are being ordered, and ammunition is being ordered. It can be distributed to various units as soon as the transaction is completed. However, the donations received in the past half year are only 300,000 yuan, and we deeply regret that we have repeatedly missed the opportunity. We hope that overseas Chinese compatriots will actively strive to understand the situation of the Righteous Army and how to properly provide relief, and provide assistance continuously, so that the restoration of lost land can be achieved as soon as possible. We hereby send this letter to express our thanks and hope you will take note. Respectfully submitted to the Overseas Chinese Charity Association of Old Java."</p>

<p>Landing This Morning</p>
<p>The new Commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai, Vice Admiral Minei, will arrive in Shanghai from Japan today to take office and unify the Japanese warships on the Yangtze River. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Entering Port at 8 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Minei Mitsumasa's flagship Izumo left Sasebo on the 5th and arrived at Wusong last night. The ship anchored at Songkou and is scheduled to sail into the Huangpu River to stop in front of the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf at 8 AM this morning. Upon hearing the news, Commander of the Japanese Naval Forces Sakano, Rear Admiral Sugisaka, Rear Admiral Tashiro, and Minister Arima Akira and Consul Ishi were all at the pier to welcome him. Sugisaka also sent 200 marines to protect the landing near the pier at that time.</p>
<p>Destroyers Arrive as Escort</p>
<p>The destroyers of the 27th Division, the Kure, Ashi, and Hishi, led by Lieutenant Colonel Fujita, first arrived in Shanghai and anchored in front of the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. Yesterday, Fujita visited Commander Sakano on the Ataka ship and paid respects to the Japanese Consul and the head of the civilian group in the afternoon. It is also heard that the fourth warship, the Hōshō, will arrive together with the flagship Izumo this morning.</p>
<p>Control of the Yangtze River Fleet</p>
<p>The warships directly under the command of the Third Fleet, as determined by the Japanese Navy Ministry and Minei, are the flagship Izumo, the cruiser Okinoshima, and four ships of the 27th Destroyer Division, totaling seven ships. The defense zone will be from Shanghai to Nanjing, while the 17 ships of the First Overseas Dispatch Force will be solely responsible for the inland defense zone of the Yangtze River, from Wuhu to Hankou and from Xiang to Changsha and Sichuan to Chongqing. The flagship will be designated as the Ataka and will be commanded by Sakano but also subject to Minei's command. When necessary, the 24 ships will be commanded by the Third Fleet, with Sakano as his deputy. Therefore, after Minei takes office, he will need to visit the capital and inspect the various ships on the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>Demanding Justice and a Satisfactory Outcome</p>
<p>Regarding the land requisition by the Ministry of Railways, villagers of Pengpu District yesterday specially sent representatives Zhao You-ting, Tao Zhi-gang, Hou Xuan-qing, and four others, together with Hong Song-jiong, a representative from the Flower and Tree Industry Association, to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM yesterday to petition for justice. Zheng Cheng-qing, the Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce, received the representatives and was informed of their intentions. Zheng agreed to forward the villagers' opinions to the Executive Yuan. At 3 PM, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. Zhao Er-chang of the Civil Training Section met with them and also agreed to forward their intentions to the central government for review. Subsequently, the representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition Director Wu, resulting in a satisfactory outcome, it is said.</p>
<p>Inspection Record of the Completion of Dike Works by the National Government Flood Relief Association</p>
<h3 id="e118">Xujiawei Dike Works <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The inspection schedule for December 2nd was as follows: At 9:30 AM, the Jiangxin steamer left Jiujiang upstream. At 11 AM, they took sampans to inspect the Xujiawei Dike Works on the south bank of Houjiawan, 20 li upstream from Jiujiang. At 12 PM, they returned to the main steamer for lunch. At 3 PM, they took sampans to inspect the north bank of the Yongquan Dike in Tianjiazhen, 3 kilometers away. At 4 PM, they returned to the main steamer and sailed directly to Hankou. The Xujiawei Dike Works, also under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District Engineering Bureau and contracted to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, is only 200 steps from the riverbank, about 4 fen chi high, and 3 meters wide. The project appeared solid. The entire group briefly surveyed it, and returned to the main steamer at 11:30 AM. The steamer sailed at 12 PM. At 1:30 PM, they passed Wuxue without stopping. At 3 PM, they landed at Makou, Guangji County, to inspect the dike works contracted by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee to Wuxue. From Wuxue up to Hankou, it all belongs to the Fifth District Engineering Bureau, whose director, Yang Si-lian, is knowledgeable in hydraulic engineering.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Inspection of the Fifth District <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District Engineering area is in the Gan River and Poyang Lake area, with the bureau's office in Nanchang. It was originally planned to go to Nanchang from Jiujiang for inspection, but the plan was temporarily abandoned due to time constraints. From Wuxue upwards is the Fifth District Engineering area, from the south bank of the Yangtze River from Jinkou Town, Wuchang County, to Jianfeng Mountain, Yangxin County, and from Dajun Mountain, Hanyang County, to Wuxue Town, Guangji County, divided into ten sections. The total dike length is 363.7 kilometers. A total of 3,491,340 cubic meters of earthwork has been completed, with a total expenditure of 184,400 yuan for administrative expenses. The actual amount of wheat and grain distributed was 30,416.6 tons. The number of disaster workers was 133,200.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Jianghan Engineering Bureau <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Regarding water conservancy projects, Hubei Province manages them relatively well along the Yangtze River, having considerable funds as a foundation, approximately 2 million yuan annually. Initially, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau was in overall charge, not under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department. Later, the Water Conservancy and Dike Works Bureaus were established separately, with the Dike Works Bureau holding the real economic power. At the same time, the Disaster Relief Committee established the Jianghan Engineering Bureau as the governing and post-disaster reconstruction organization for the completed dikes in the province. After Chairman Chiang's inspection of various water conservancy projects, he considered the work not entirely satisfactory and therefore abolished the Water Conservancy and Dike Works Bureaus, with the Jianghan Dike Works Bureau exclusively responsible for all water conservancy matters in the province. The takeover has recently been completed. It is heard that future plans will focus on: (1) Expediting the construction of various areas where construction was previously impossible due to the Communist bandit situation, aiming for complete completion within the shortest possible time; (2) Striving to devise dike protection strategies. According to engineering staff, Hubei's dike projects are the most perfect among all provinces because Hubei workers themselves have extremely rich experience in dike construction, which has invisibly created a foundation for superior results. Jiangsu and other provinces have always paid attention to river channels, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Perfect Dike Works <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The perfection of Hubei's dike works is most immediately apparent to us in the Yongquan Dike within the Fifth District project. The Jiangxin steamer arrived at Makou, Guangji County at 3:30 PM, backed by mountains and facing water, a charming scene with a poetic feel. The entire group boarded sampans and crossed to the north bank, reaching the Yongquan Dike after a few hundred steps. The dike is 3 meters wide and approximately 9 kilometers long, starting from Wuxue in the east and ending at Qichun County in the west, rebuilt on the old dike. The five major breaches at the time have all been repaired, and the project is exceptionally solid. The lush grass along both sides provides protection. It is heard that Director Yang Si-lian of the Fifth District Engineering Bureau sowed Panicum repens seeds, which grew very quickly, resulting in today's achievements. The dike surface is extremely flat, without any unevenness. Mr. Li Zu-shen said that this is indeed an ideal dike. At 4:30 PM, they returned to the main steamer and continued upstream. At 5:30 PM, they arrived at Qipanzhou, Weiyuan Estuary, under the jurisdiction of Yangxin County, Hubei. The entire group again boarded small boats to inspect the Chenzhen Dike on the south bank, which is approximately 8.8 kilometers long and equally perfect as the Yongquan Dike. Both the Yongquan Dike and Chenzhen Dike face the river and are backed by mountains, both producing coal and other minerals. There are many coal kilns near the Yongquan Dike, specializing in the manufacture of coal balls, making a considerable profit. At 6 PM, they returned to the main steamer, which sailed directly to Hankou. After dinner, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Min-yi gave a Tai Chi performance and showed flood relief films.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Harmony in Hankou <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangxin steamer is expected to arrive in Hankou tomorrow morning (the 3rd), followed by a luncheon hosted by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau at noon, and a banquet hosted by the Hankou Municipal Government and various sectors in the evening. On the 4th, Chairman Chiang will host a banquet, starting at 5 PM, before inspecting dike works at Xinti, Jianli, Yuekou, and other places, including bandit areas, then return to Hankou and proceed north to Zhengzhou and Luoyang. (Sent by Qian Hua from Hankou on the morning of the 3rd) Telegram from the Dike Works Inspection Team: Song, Chairman of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, please note: This time, colleagues and others participated in the Dike Works Inspection Team, departing from Shanghai on the 11th and arriving in Beijing on the 20th to attend the Dike Works Completion Ceremony, then boarding the steamer. However, due to the excessive length of the dike lines in various districts along the way and the shortness of time, we could only selectively disembark to inspect them in sequence each day. On the 21st, from Zhenjiang to the Foganzhou Dike and Guadong Dike on the north bank of the First District; on the 22nd, from Wuhu to the Yijishan Dike and Lugang Dike on the south bank of the Second District, and in the afternoon to the Huangsitan Dike on the south bank of the Second District; on the morning of the 30th, to the Liubai Zhang Dike in Tongcheng County on the north bank of the Second District. The dike was not initially included in the discussion due to the Engineering Bureau and construction was delayed, with about one-tenth of the project still unfinished and currently under construction. In the afternoon, we continued to inspect the Guangjiwei Dike of the Third District in Huaining County; on the morning of December 1st, to the Mahua Dike in Wangjiang County, Anhui Province, of the Third District; in the afternoon, to the Huikou Dike of Jiujiang County and the Duanyao Dike of Huangmei County, both on the north bank, repaired on behalf of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee. In summary, in the past few days, we have inspected various dikes and referred to the Engineering Bureau's various district engineering overviews and standard drawings to separately inspect the dike surface width and the internal and external slopes, all of which still meet the requirements. The height of each dike exceeds last year's flood level by one meter. We have secretly investigated that your association, after the disaster last year, carefully planned and maintained the project, completing this great project in a few months with the most economical plan. After our inspection, we deeply admire it. This year's autumn harvest is abundant, and the residents along the river especially appreciate the great virtue. In addition to continuing the inspection according to the itinerary and reporting at any time, we know that you are concerned, and we respectfully submit this telegram for your perusal. Dike Works Inspection Team: Xu Shi-ying, Wen Lan-ting, Simpson, Li Zu-shen, Zhou Xiang-xian, Xi De-jiong, etc., and all colleagues kowtow.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Questions in the Chinese and Foreign Concessions&gt;</p>
<h3 id="e123">Telephone Contract <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of negotiating a contract for installing telephones in areas with roads built beyond the concessions, according to Xu Yuan-fang, Secretary of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, everything is now complete for the contract. However, Director Huang believes that a Chinese version of the contract must be used for signing, so the concession telephone company still needs to hire lawyers to carefully discuss and translate the Chinese version into English before signing.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Electricity in West Shanghai <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of supplying water and electricity to areas with roads built beyond the concessions in West Shanghai, yesterday, Xu Yuan-fang, Secretary of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, told the Central News Agency reporter that the water and electricity required by residents on both sides of the roads built beyond the concessions in West Shanghai could have been supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company or the Shanghai South China Merchants Electric Company. However, because the roads in the area were previously built by the concessions and it was inconvenient for the Chinese-run water and electricity companies to lay electrical conduits under the road surface, the Shanghai Electric Power Company of the concession has been supplying it. However, residents must first submit an application to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval before sending it to the Electric Power Company for connection. In recent years, the number of residents on both sides of the roads built beyond the concessions has increased daily, and the demand for electricity has also increased. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has fixed regulations on the size of the electrical conduits, so the Shanghai Electric Power Company requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to replace the larger electrical conduits to supply larger power. The Municipal Government believes that this matter still needs to be discussed and appointed Huang Bo-qiao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Cai Zeng-ji, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Xu Pei-huang, a Municipal Government Specialist, to represent the Municipal Government and contact the company to discuss this matter. The initiative actually started during the tenure of former Mayor Zhang Qun and has been more than a year. Recently, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has again requested the Municipal Government to approve this request as soon as possible, so the Municipal Government ordered Director Huang and others to convene a meeting as soon as possible to decide whether to approve the request.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Radio Broadcasting <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that the officers of the Chinese Broadcasting Association and the Wireless Radio Merchant Association of this port held an informal meeting with representatives of the Municipal Government and the two concession authorities at the Huangma Hang Hotel this afternoon (the 6th) to discuss methods for managing radio broadcasting in this port. Representatives of the Municipal Government and the two concession authorities attended the meeting as informal observers so that they could listen to the suggestions and opinions of the radio industry in order to negotiate a concrete management plan. In the future, after this plan is approved by all relevant organizations, the Municipal Government and the two concession authorities will make it into a law.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Yesterday's News of a Major Case of Fraudulent Relief: Suspension of Relief Funds in Wuhe County <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of Wuhe County Arrived to Appeal</p>
<p>Quan Shao-wu Firmly Denied Suspension of Relief</p>
<p>Yang Shu-cheng, Quan Shao-wu, Wang Fan-wu, and Cha Liang-zhao, officials of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, were accused of embezzling relief grain and diverting relief funds from Anhui disaster relief matters for personal gain. The Standing Committee of the Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai, including Li Zhen-ya, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, which has been heard several times. All accusations against the first defendant, Yang Shu-cheng, have been heard. The previous hearing on the accusation against the second defendant, Quan Shao-wu, regarding the suspension of urgent relief funds to Wuhe County, was not yet completed. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Wu Ting-qi specially opened the Second Criminal Court to summon both parties and witnesses for continued examination. Many people were still crowding the court to listen. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that regarding the suspension of urgent relief funds to Wuhe, the Wuhe County Chamber of Commerce, Farmers Association, Education Association, and other legal entities had elected Chen Lu-zhen, the former chairman of the Wuhe County Relief Branch, to bring all relevant documents to the court for detailed verification. Chen Lu-zhen then explained the reason for Quan Shao-wu's suspension of urgent relief, stating that on May 21st of this year, two investigation committee members, He Bing-heng, who were sent to Wuhe by Commissioner Quan to investigate relief distribution, had a conflict with the local people. Commissioner Quan then telegraphed He and others to suspend relief until June 9th. Only after repeated appeals from local government agencies and groups did they continue to distribute relief, totaling a 15-day suspension. The relief distributed at that time was urgent relief. Judge Wu then examined the stub of the relief ticket issued by Quan Shao-wu on May 29th, which was presented previously. After Chen Lu-zhen carefully examined it, he added that this kind of stub had neither the seal of the National Government Flood Relief Committee nor the seal of the local county government. Moreover, if they had gone to distribute relief, there would be no receipt issued by the local relief branch for collecting funds. Therefore, not only was no relief distributed on May 29th, but the stub was probably forged and should be noted. The court then questioned the source of the stub presented by the defendant, Quan Shao-wu. Quan claimed that it was obtained from the director of the Bengbu Relief Audit Office. Quan also explained the reason why this ticket stub was different from other ticket stubs, saying that the relief authorities disliked the slow progress of relief in northern Anhui, so Xin Bosen of the Flood Relief Committee ordered him to form a joint committee in Bengbu to handle relief in northern Anhui in order to speed up the process. The Flood Relief Committee approved the on-site printing of relief tickets if they were insufficient. The stub presented was printed in Bengbu, so there was no seal of the National Government Flood Relief Committee. The relief funds were distributed by the joint committee. Therefore, the people of Wuhe opposed the joint committee and claimed that he had suspended relief because the relief funds were not distributed by the local flood relief association. The plaintiff's lawyer then presented the draft copies of various documents and telegrams related to the request for relief, stating that the court would understand that the suspension of relief was indeed the truth after reviewing the case file. Judge Wu then asked Chen Lu-zhen about the form of the relief ticket on June 9th. Chen replied that it also had no seal of the Flood Relief Committee or the county government. The court then instructed him: "You claim that the relief ticket stub on May 29th was forged because it did not have the seal of the National Government Flood Relief Committee. Why do you not question the ticket stub without a seal on June 9th?" He then turned to Quan Shao-wu and said that various documents and telegrams from the Anhui Provincial Government, the Anhui Provincial People's Hall, Wuhe County, and the workgroup of the National Government Flood Relief Committee all mentioned the suspension of relief, so the suspension of relief in Wuhe was indeed the case. However, the defendant, Quan Shao-wu, firmly denied it, saying that although there was a telegram sent to Wuhe after the conflict with the word "temporary suspension" in it, no relief was actually suspended. The words "suspension of relief" in the various documents and telegrams all originated from the word "temporary suspension." If the court considered the word "temporary suspension" to be a crime, the defendant would naturally accept it. However, if the fault of actually suspending relief was established, then he could not but defend himself. The plaintiff claimed that he suspended relief based on many empty words, but he had presented the relief ticket to prove that relief was still being distributed on May 29th, and the relief ticket stub on May 29th could also be obtained from Bengbu. Judge Wu adjourned the hearing because it was already dark and instructed that the hearing would continue on the afternoon of the 13th of this month.</p>

<p>Diligence Has Merit ... Teasing is Useless</p>
<p>Zhang Ming-jin, an Anhui laborer working at the Texaco Wharf in Gaoqiao, Pudong, lived in the Xiao Sha-yun barbershop in that area. Zhang was fond of joking, which led to teasing and then to a serious argument with his colleague Wang Ming-biao. The two immediately fought on the wharf. Zhang Kong-wu was strong, and Wang could not win. Wang harbored resentment and gathered several people the day before yesterday afternoon to seek out Zhang for a fight in the barbershop, destroying the barbershop. Zhang, outnumbered, was stabbed in the head five or six times, bleeding profusely and falling unconscious. The barbershop owner, Chen Yun-you, returned home and saw the situation. After asking the reason, he reported it to the Fourth Police Station of the Third District. The police arrested Wang. Yesterday, he was transferred to the local court for examination.</p>
<p>A Rickshaw Puller Calculates Accounts with His Master</p>
<h3 id="e129">Shortly After Being Released from Prison, He Dared to Gather Gangsters to Extort Money, First Demanding 5,000 Yuan, Then Reducing it to 3,000 Yuan <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>| After Investigation, He was Sentenced to One Year in Prison |</p>
<p>Wang Ren-fu, the owner of Fenghe Paint Shop at No. 134 Shandong Road, lived at No. 1451 Zhonghua Road in the city. His son, Rui-bao, had been riding a reserved rickshaw pulled by Cai A-fu, a man from Tongzhou, to a school in the French Concession since April 27th of last year. While passing the Siming Guild Hall on Minguo Road, several kidnappers suddenly kidnapped Rui-bao, and Wang redeemed him with a huge sum of money. The Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested several kidnappers, who confessed that Cai A-fu was the mastermind. The Public Security Bureau arrested Cai, who frankly admitted to being an informant. He was sent to the Shanghai Local Court, which sentenced Cai to 12 years in prison. Cai appealed to the Suzhou High Court, which recently acquitted him and released him from prison on the 25th of last month. The day before yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Wang Ren-fu was at Fenghe for business when Cai suddenly gathered several gangsters and came to Wang, saying, "I was arrested and sentenced to 12 years in prison because you reported me. I have been released from prison and came to settle the score for the losses I suffered. Quickly give me 5,000 gold yuan as compensation, or you should be careful when you go out, or I may have to kidnap your son again." He then reduced the amount to 2,000 yuan. Wang pretended to agree and promised to pay the money, but said he needed to go out to prepare it. Cai did not suspect and agreed. Wang then went out and reported to the General Inspection Office of the General Police Station. Chief Inspector Lu Lian-kui ordered detectives Liu Shao-kui, Gai Zhao-bin, and others to rush to the scene and arrest Cai and bring him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated the case and said that he was now prosecuting according to Article 370, Section 3 of the Criminal Code, for attempted extortion. Wang Ren-fu and his bodyguard Chen Xiang-tao then filed a case to prove how the defendant had threatened him at the time.

<h3 id="e130">Case of Two Koreans Kicking a Chinese Man to Death <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Final Appraisal Report Published</p>
<p>Confirmed that the Chinese Man was Kicked to Death by Koreans</p>
<p>Koreans Li Chang-lian and Gui Xi-ren had a dispute with an old woman from Changshu, Yao Chen, over the purchase of baked sweet potatoes, and kicked her second son, Yao Xiao-ji, in the abdomen, causing him to die after ineffective medical treatment. The local court appointed Prosecutor Yang Qi to conduct an interrogation together with Ma Zu-fan of the Investigation Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Dr. Tenggong, appointed by the Japanese Consulate. They conducted a joint examination, but the Japanese doctor refused to conduct a joint examination because Yao Xiao-ji's abdomen had already been dissected before his death and it was impossible to determine who caused the fatal injury. Prosecutor Yang ordered the forensic doctor to conduct a forensic examination as required, which found that Yao Xiao-ji was indeed kicked in the abdomen, resulting in death. However, the Japanese Consulate considered the examination results questionable and did not allow the two Koreans to be punished. Therefore, Lou Ying, the Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court, sent a letter to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for a detailed autopsy. The autopsy was conducted on November 23rd, and a pathological tissue examination was performed. The appraisal report was prepared and sent to the court and the Municipal Public Security Bureau a few days ago, requesting them to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate. The conclusion of the appraisal report is recorded as follows: "Combining the above examination descriptions and the first to fifth appraisal items, a conclusion can be obtained, namely that Gui Xi-ren and Yao Xiao-ji fought with each other, and Gui Xi-ren used his foot to forcefully kick Yao Xiao-ji's abdomen, hitting the center of the navel (slightly to the left), causing a contusion of the abdominal wall. The force reached the deep part, causing a contusion and laceration of the jejunum wall in the abdominal cavity. Although the bleeding was stopped by surgery in the hospital, the intestinal contents leaked into the peritoneum, causing purulent acute peritonitis, resulting in death after five days of ineffective medical treatment." It is heard that Director Wen approved the letter and sent Jin Gong, the Director of the Fifth District, to the Japanese Consulate General's Office for serious negotiations.</p>

<p>A Seven-Year-Old Child Tragically Burned to Death</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around nine o'clock, an elderly woman surnamed Zhang, who rented a room on the second floor of the Wan Chang Soy Sauce Garden at 1115-1117 Xin Zha Road, carelessly overturned a kerosene stove while cooking, causing an immediate fire. Employees of the garden noticed and called the fire department. By the time the fire trucks arrived, the fire had already broken through the roof. The woman was still trying to extinguish the fire, and her entire body was engulfed in flames. Firefighters used a ladder to pull her out of a window, but her limbs were already badly burned. She was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The fire was extinguished around 9:30 AM, having only destroyed one room on the mezzanine. After the fire was put out, firefighters investigating the cause of the fire suddenly discovered the charred body of a young child. Upon investigation, it was learned that the woman had a grandson named A Gen, only seven years old. In the chaos of the fire, the woman had been too focused on putting out the blaze and had forgotten to rescue the child, resulting in his tragic death.</p>

<p>Recently, the Da Dong Bookstore hosted a banquet at the Bankers' Association for the shareholders of its family education project. Many guests gave speeches, but Mr. Wang Xiaolai's was the most interesting. He said that his family education was based on military discipline. When he returns home, all of his children are as quiet as crows and sparrows, not daring to make a sound. They line up in the courtyard and are asked about their studies and character. Even those still in their mother's arms seem to want to stop nursing and stand up straight. As a result, although he has many children – twenty-five – the atmosphere in his home is extremely quiet, and nothing has ever been broken. This shows the importance of family education, and the Da Dong Bookstore's raising of capital for family education is an important undertaking. He also said that the establishment of family education lectures is very necessary. Although he is busy, he has managed to sneak in and listen to two of them. If he has time, he would like to give a lecture to promote his family's discipline. It is reported that the family education lecture yesterday was given by Mr. Dong Renjian, and the topic was "How Should Family Education Be Implemented?" Today's lecture will be given by Mr. Jiang Hengyuan, and the topic will be "Family Education and the Future of the Nation."</p>

<p>Why Did Wang Ziqiang Mock Li Buyun?  Two Apprentices Thus Became Bitter Enemies.</p>
<p>What Glory or Shame Does a Father's Employment Bring to His Son?</p>
<p>The Courage of Youth... Why Hold a Grudge and Kill?</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at midnight, a bloody incident occurred inside the Wanyuan Shun Kaoliang Wine Shop at 174 Datong Road, under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District of Zhabei. The parties involved were apprentices and fellow workers in the shop, and they were also from the same hometown. The details of the investigation are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e137">What Does a Father's Lowly Position Have To Do With His Son? <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Wang Lizhen, from Tongxiang, Zhejiang, works as an accountant in the Baoshan County Salt Guildhall at the intersection of Yongxing Road and Datong Road. His son, Wang Ziqiang, 17, was introduced by his uncle to work as an apprentice at the Wanyuan Shun Wine Shop at 174 Datong Road two years ago. Li Buyun, also from Tongxiang, works as a runner in the Songjiang County Salt Guildhall. Because he and Wang Lizhen live near each other in their hometown, they are very familiar with each other. Li's son, Li Yuanjing, 19, joined the shop as an apprentice five years ago. He has now completed his apprenticeship and been promoted to a fellow worker, earning a monthly salary of five yuan. He is quiet, studious, and often studies in his spare time. Wang Ziqiang, on the other hand, is arrogant and often boasts about his family background to his peers. He also mocks Yuanzhang and insults his father for his low position. As a result, Li feels resentful and has clashed with Wang repeatedly. But Wang does not restrain himself and continues to provoke Li, who cannot suppress his anger. Thus, the seeds of this incident were sown.</p>

<p>Recently, the relationship between Wang and Li has deteriorated. Li has been harboring vengeful intentions, but Wang has not noticed. Around midnight yesterday morning, Li saw that the other workers were asleep. He put on his clothes, quietly left the bedroom on the upper floor of the shop's reception room, and walked slowly downstairs. He first went to the kitchen, found a cleaver, and then entered the shop's back room, where Ziqiang was sleeping. He held the knife and slashed at Ziqiang's head. Wang was startled by the pain and struggled violently, and his arms and legs were also cut. He cried out loudly for help. The people in the shop, alerted by the commotion, gathered around and saw Ziqiang lying motionless in a pool of blood, Yuanzhang standing blankly beside him, holding a cleaver. The crowd snatched the cleaver from his hand and asked Li why he had committed such a cruel act. Li replied, "One man acts, one man pays. I will not implicate you." With that, he pushed through the crowd, walked to the door of the shop, poured a bowl of wine from the wine jar, and took out something from his pocket and swallowed it with the wine. Seeing this, the crowd knew that he had taken poison and rushed forward to hold down his hands. They saw that Li still had half a piece of opium in his hand and quickly snatched it away and forced him to sit on a stool.</p>

<p>The shop's other workers were terrified and quickly sent someone to report to the shop owner and Wang Lizhen. They also hired a car to take Li to Baolong Hospital and called the hospital, asking them to send an ambulance to take Wang Ziqiang away. They also reported the incident to the Fourth District Police Station. Yesterday afternoon, Li's father was also notified by the shop and rushed from Songjiang. However, Li Yuanzhang had not taken a deep dose of poison, so he was saved by the doctors at Baolong Hospital. The hospital then notified the Xin Zha Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Li and interrogate him. The police ordered him to be detained. This morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, explained the situation, saying that Wang Ziqiang's father had reported the incident to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau after his son was injured, but the Public Security Bureau had not sent anyone to the court today. He requested that the case be investigated. Judge Wu Zhen ordered Li Yuanzhang to be detained pending the Public Security Bureau's official transfer of the case. It was learned that Li had inflicted twelve cuts on Wang, four of which were to the head and were considered fatal, so his life was in great danger. Li's father visited Ziqiang in the hospital yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Taxpayers' Association Repeatedly Sends Letters to the Public Works Department, Requesting That It Order the Water Company Not to Cut Off Water <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Water Fee Disputes Can Be Discussed at Length</p>
<p>Direct Action Endangers Residents' Lives</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent letters yesterday to the Public Works Department and its Director-General, stating: (1) "We are writing to inform you that according to a letter from the Deli Landlord Accounting Office, since the Shanghai Waterworks Company increased water rates, our company has been unable to pay due to the excessive burden. We believed that the dispute could be resolved through negotiations between your association, the water company, and the Public Works Department. However, the water company has taken high-handed measures, disregarding everything and abruptly cutting off the water supply to the Baifu and Bailu residential areas on Yangzhou Road, Fenzhou Road, and Huasheng Road at 11:00 AM this morning, causing immediate chaos. Hundreds of households in these two areas face the threat of being unable to cook, which is a major issue affecting social order and residents' lives. We are compelled to request that your association negotiate with the water company as soon as possible and insist that the water supply be restored before any further discussion can take place." The letter goes on to say that cutting off the water supply is not a viable solution to the water fee dispute. If those who depend on water as their lifeline were to take direct action similar to the water company's, the serious consequences would be easily imagined by your Director-General. We are sending this letter to request that you investigate the matter and promptly order the water company to restore the water supply in order to find a solution that benefits all parties. (2) "We are writing to inform you that according to a letter from the Fenxing Real Estate Company, our company has a block water agreement for its rental properties located on Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road, Niuzhuang Road, and Weishui Lane. The water users are the tenants, and our company does not wish to continue its obligation to collect water fees on behalf of the Shanghai Waterworks Company. We have requested that water meters be installed in each household so that the company can directly collect water fees from the tenants, which is a reasonable request supported by the precedent of the electricity and telephone companies. However, in June of this year, the company unilaterally installed a master water meter and forced us to pay water fees. Our company cannot agree to this. However, as the meter was not installed in each household, we continue to pay water fees under the block water agreement and hold the funds in escrow pending resolution. We notified the water company of this matter in a letter dated October 24th, forwarded by the Real Estate Association. We have since received a letter from the company dated November 3rd, giving us until the 7th of this month to pay the water fees under the master water meter system, threatening to cut off the water supply. Such oppressive behavior affects the lives of our tenants, and as landlords, we cannot remain silent. We request that your association uphold justice and achieve a truly fair outcome, which would be fortunate for the tenants and the entire city. Furthermore, the company's master water meter system is one that our company has repeatedly stated that we object to, yet we have received bills from June to November totaling $2,190.32. The water fees for the Sanyou Society on the third floor of the building along the street are included in this amount, yet the company has also collected block water fees of 120 taels of silver for the months of June, July, August, and September. This demonstrates the company's self-contradictory and greedy behavior. Can a public utility as large as the Public Works Department act in such a way?" The letter goes on to say that until a reasonable solution can be found that is acceptable to all parties, it seems best to maintain the status quo. Adopting the method of cutting off the water supply to achieve a unilateral benefit is akin to blaming the fishpond for the fire at the city gate because one acknowledges that the water cannot be used to establish that the landlord is not acknowledging the master watermeter system. Since the tenants can prove that the increased rate would ultimately be their burden, the difficulties with cutting off the water supply may come from those outside the matter of tenants and landlords. Therefore, the Bureau should give the matter special attention. The letter also requested that the bureau follow the latest suggestions of the Association, and seek out the appropriate resolution.</p>

<p>Cihang Midwifery School Approved for Establishment. Dr. Wang Haoran, a famous doctor in Shanghai, invested in and established the Cihang Midwifery School in the 19th year of the Republic. He hired Chu Minyi, Wang Qizhang, Liu Zhigang, Zheng Shenchu, and others as school directors. After it opened, Dr. Wang sold his personal property for more than 20,000 yuan to provide the school's funds. Since then, the school's facilities have become increasingly perfect and the number of students has gradually grown. This summer, the Municipal Education Bureau set a deadline for private schools to apply for establishment, but the school still lacked funds. Dr. Wang generously planned to raise tens of thousands of yuan to be used as a fund for the establishment procedure, which was approved by the Municipal Education Bureau's meeting. The school's foundation is becoming more solid, and it is reported that a new plan will be implemented next semester, adding equipment, hiring famous doctors as professors, and expanding the number of students to popularize midwifery education.</p>

<p>Mr. Lü Yuru reports: ㈠ "Things at their extreme will revert," and "Too much honey is not sweet." Excessive emotion inevitably leads to temporary rifts. Relationships formed from the illusion of love are even more certain to drop from boiling point to zero. ㈡ Those who have not yet married should carefully examine their partners. Those who are married should respect each other, be sincere and trustworthy, love without being disrespectful, and respect without fear, so that they can always get along harmoniously.</p>
<p>Mr. Mai Zifen reports: ㈠ This is due to the physics of "things at their extreme will revert" and the psychology of "marriage is the grave of love." ㈡ Before marriage, the heat of love should be controlled to prevent it from reaching boiling point. After marriage, efforts should be made to maintain the original love, such as occasional separations or traveling together.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shaowen reports: ㈠ It is the result of the development of human laziness and greed. ㈡ The concepts of loyalty and forgiveness must be used to remedy it.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Guohua reports: ㈠ It is because one of the elements constituting "love" is missing between the spirit and the flesh. ㈡ (A) Mutual respect, love, and trust, (B) Ensuring financial affluence, (C) Being able to share both joys and sorrows, (D) Exercising self-restraint with reason, (E) Sleeping separately, (F) Having lively children.</p>
<p>Mr. Jing Zhen reports: ㈠ Due to misunderstanding of freedom or oppression from old-fashioned families. ㈡ From the government down to judicial officials, school teachers, and family elders, young people should be taught the true meaning of mutual understanding and assistance between husband and wife, sharing both joys and sorrows. Mr. Yan Yun reports: ㈠ It originates from the economic phenomena caused by the exploitative society; this is just a small branch of the entire social problem. ㈡ The social system must be thoroughly reformed. All idealistic methods are useless. Mr. Xie Xinwu reports: ㈠ (A) Before marriage, both sides conceal their weaknesses. After marriage, all weaknesses are exposed. (B) Life after marriage is very different from the ideals before marriage. ㈡ Mutual understanding, comparing other couples (less fortunate than oneself), extracurricular activities, and couple pastimes should be academic to make life less ordinary. Mr. Zhang Shaoliang reports: ㈠ Either due to economic pressure or a lack of personality in one party. ㈡ One must live within one's means and pay attention to personality cultivation.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Mingchang reports: ㈠ Due to too much freedom before marriage and too little freedom after marriage, and neither party has fully examined the other before marriage. ㈡ The time between dating and engagement should be long. Both parties must be open and honest, understand and help each other, or go on outings and trips.</p>

<p>Mr. Ge Chuan-gui reports: 1. Your newspaper says "All problems and difficulties are not individual." I think you can only say "not all are individual," but you cannot say "none are individual." Moreover, those problems and difficulties that are "not individual" are certainly important, but those that are "individual" are particularly important to the person who raises the problem or difficulty. The "Reader Consultant" should also answer them. For example, regarding natural science mentioned in the "Concise Rules," if someone raises a question or doubt about chemistry or physics, it may not be something that the average reader wants to know, but the person who asks the question attaches great importance to it. 2. Since your newspaper has hired several experts, it seems that their names should be published, or at least it should be stated under each answer which expert answered it. This seems more solemn, and readers would seem happier because each expert is responsible for the answer. 3. Mr. Liu said, "Not to degenerate into the kind of three hundred solutions to arithmetic problems." Of course, that arithmetic expert does not have so much time to answer three hundred difficult problems for one reader, but I think if someone asks for a solution to an arithmetic problem, that arithmetic expert should be responsible for solving it for him. I think answering "special problems" for readers (e.g., how to solve a certain arithmetic problem, or what is the factual situation of a certain event in a certain country at a certain time) is more important and more difficult than answering many general questions (e.g., how to study or how to serve society). Fortunately, since there are experts, it is easy as long as each specializes in his own specialty. 4. Your newspaper advocates submitting more important issues to the public for discussion, and then your newspaper will synthesize opinions and make a conclusion. I think there are many issues that are not "opinions" issues. For example, arithmetic problems should always be studied by the arithmetic expert first. If he cannot figure it out, then it should be published in the newspaper and ask arithmetic experts across the country to study it.</p>
<p>Reply: Thank you very much for Mr. Ge's instructions丨However, there are some things that I dare not agree with. The reply is as follows: ㈠ The reasons why "all problems and difficulties are not individual" have been seen in the origin of this column published one day, and as Mr. Ge cited, the example of "difficulties in chemistry or physics" especially clearly shows that this kind of academic doubt cannot be unique to individuals. ㈡ It is of course possible to disclose the names of experts, but it is not necessary. ㈢ Mr. Liu Tingfang's statement in his letter, "Not to degenerate into the kind of three hundred solutions to opening skills and difficult problems," originally meant to hope that this column's vibrant garden would not degenerate into a rigid and barren land like an account book. "Three hundred solutions to arithmetic problems" is a metaphor. ㈣ Not every problem is proposed for discussion. Only some of the more important problems are proposed for discussion. Arithmetic problems are naturally handed over to experts to answer.</p>

<p>Su Education Commissioner Zhou Fohai Inspects Northern Jiangsu Record (4)</p>
<p>Calls Together Elementary School Teachers and Staff for Instruction</p>
<p>Proceeds from Inspection of Schools to Rugao</p>
<p>(Nantong Dispatch) Su Education Commissioner Zhou Fohai's three-day inspection of Nantong has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhou summoned elementary school teachers and educational administrators on the evening of the 3rd of this month, with more than 200 people attending. The general idea of the instruction was that there are generally three problems with local education in Jiangsu Province: one is exhaustion, two is disputes, and three is waste. However, Nantong is generally still good, but the self-closure and lack of research in the education sector urgently need to be continuously improved. There are three things I would like to encourage my colleagues with: first, do not save trouble. It is a mistake to say that it is better to do one less thing than one more thing. Second, do not be afraid of trouble. It is also wrong to say that you do not seek merit but seek no fault, because no merit is fault. If you are truly causing disputes for the sake of reforming education in Huai, you should take full responsibility, and I will do my best to protect you. Third, do not make mistakes. The ancients said that you should think before you act, and this sentence is extremely valuable. Educational administrators and teachers should cooperate and divide their work. Educational administrators should do their best to raise funds, and teachers should not neglect their own duties because of insufficient funding. I hope everyone will work together with the spirit of what I said before, "two people eat one person's meal and one person does two people's work," under the current situation where education funding is extremely difficult. Chen, the section chief, then stated that Nantong education has three advantages: ㈠ Solid foundation, ㈡ No factions or localism, ㈢ Teachers and staff are dedicated, and students can study hard. However, there are also two points to note: ㈠ Pay attention to physical education, ㈡ Have a sense of initiative. Regarding universal education, the education department has three methods: ㈠ Supplementing school enrollment, ㈡ Township and towns should establish junior primary schools, ㈢ Improving private schools. The above three items will be promulgated with detailed measures soon, and each county must hold a publicity week for improving private schools, hoping that colleagues in the education sector will cooperate. Section Chief Xiang then stated that there are two contributions to Nantong's school education: ㈠ Emphasize the cultivation of elementary school children, and should not simply impart knowledge. ㈡ Teachers and staff should continue to study academics and teaching methods. There is also one request, which is to cooperate with social education. As for social education: ㈠ The work should be practical, ㈡ It should be deeply rooted in the masses. Finally, the director of the Education Bureau replied on behalf of the administration and dispersed. On the morning of the 4th, Zhou and his party went to the Daquan Yarn Factory Deputy Factory to visit and inquired in detail about the improvement of cotton seeds, factory equipment, and labor treatment. They then inspected the rural primary schools at Baitang Temple and Cao Gong Temple, visited the historical sites of Nantong. Visited the farmers' homes at the Japanese Tomb and took a group photo. I heard the sound of looms in the fields, which was very admirable, saying that Nantong truly deserves the name of a model county. They then went to the School for the Blind and Deaf, where the blind and deaf students welcomed them in teams and performed martial arts, with lively spirits, which was very pitiful. Zhou immediately donated one hundred yuan to reward them. After leaving the school, they went to Zhang Jian's tomb and traveled around the five mountains. That night, they stayed at the Sanyuan Palace in Langshan. On the 5th, at 8 o'clock, they attended the Tongzhong Anniversary Week in heavy rain and gave instructions. They continued to inspect the Education Bureau, Commercial Middle School, and visited the Nantong College of Science, Hospital, and Museum. They left Nantong at 2 PM to go to Rugao.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Standards for Kindergarten and Elementary School Curricula Promulgated by the Ministry of Education (50) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Manual Arts</p>
<p>First, Goals</p>
<p>㈠ To cultivate children's laboring skills and the spirit of equality, mutual assistance, and cooperation.</p>
<p>㈡ To develop children's planning and creative abilities.</p>
<p>㈢ To increase children's interest and ability in production and to inspire their aspirations and knowledge to improve life, agriculture, or industry.</p>
<p>Second, Types of Work</p>
<p>㈠ School Affairs: The principle of using fewer school workers should be followed. All school affairs, large and small, should be discussed by the children and teachers together, and the work methods should be assigned separately. The teachers must examine the consequences.</p>
<p>㈡ Household Affairs: Schools with better household equipment should focus on working in the school. If the equipment is lacking, the work can be arranged in the school and the work methods can be discussed. The operation is limited to the household, and the teachers find ways to examine the results. The scope of work focuses on food, clothing, and shelter.</p>
<p>㈢ Agricultural Affairs: In addition to remote arts, which must be operated in the school, this type of work must be available in rural or urban areas. Planting and animal husbandry should be set up in rural elementary schools. If it cannot be set up, the scope of work can be specified in the school, and the working methods can be studied. The family is limited to being an assistant to the father and brother, and the teacher finds ways to examine the results. The scope is: 1. Gardening: Studying the planting of local major vegetables and common flowers and fruit trees must be combined with the work of the natural science department to form an entire unit. If it is absolutely unavoidable, the content of the course can be reduced and changed to "potted plants." 2. Farming: Studying the cultivation of local major crops and the improvement of agricultural tools and new cultivation methods, and studying the improvement of farmers' lives. 3. Animal Husbandry: Raising local common poultry, livestock, and silkworms, bees, fish, etc., and studying and experimenting with new animal husbandry methods.</p>
<p>㈣ Industry: Focus on making and studying local special crafts. Schools that focus on agricultural affairs can omit this work if they cannot have both. Each school can set up the following crafts as much as possible according to environmental needs and abilities. Senior grade students need to do one or two things: ㈠ Special products and crafts, such as straw hats in Shandong, straw hats and woven mats in Ningbo, Zhejiang... All those that children can do are set up in the school, or children are limited to helping their fathers and brothers operate at home. The teachers examine the results. ㈡ Paper crafts: making paper flowers, books, toys, models, stationery, furniture, etc., and understanding the lives of such workers. ㈢ Earthwork: Operation of toys, models, stationery, bricks, tiles, etc., and understanding, investigation, and research of the lives of such workers. ㈣ Carpentry: making toys, models, stationery, furniture, etc., and understanding, investigation, and research of the lives of such workers. ㈤ Metalwork: making toys, armor, etc., and understanding, investigation, and research of the lives of such workers.</p>

<p>㈠ This subject should fully combine with social and natural joint teaching, and should fully apply the design of single units, such as "Toy Life" in Grades 1 and 2, "Original Life" or "Foreign Life" in Grades 3 and 4, etc. as a teaching method</p>
<p>㈡ Investigating local specialties and choosing to use them as teaching materials is a major task of labor education</p>
<p>㈢ The real environment, such as family factories, shops, fields, villages, transportation agencies, etc., is a reference for labor methods and a large source of labor materials. Cheap or free real objects and pieces should be fully utilized, such as advertising products, advertising paintings, sample cloths, furniture factories' useless equipment, crops that can be obtained from farms... They should also be fully collected for application, and children should be encouraged to refer to and collect them themselves</p>
<p>㈣ On-site operations and investigations are most prone to fatigue due to labor. Fully utilize methods such as achievement competitions to encourage children to work hard</p>
<p>㈤ Before on-site operation and investigation, children must be fully planned to make children budget, so that the methods, time, and materials used are economical and effective</p>
<p>㈥ During on-site operation, it is necessary to pay attention to whether the child can operate according to the prior plan, correct his mistakes at any time, assist him with what he cannot do, and guide them with economical and ingenious methods, but the child's freedom of expression should not be encroached upon</p>
<p>㈦ After the on-site operation and investigation are completed, the shortcomings must be criticized, the merits and demerits of the achievements must be compared, and the children must be informed of their progress</p>
<p>㈧ Emphasize joint operations to cultivate a spirit of cooperation</p>
<p>㈨ Discussion and research must be integrated with operation and investigation, and must not be an independent operation and become empty talk</p>
<p>㈩ Appropriate materials for appreciation can be provided to increase children's artistic interest. Stories about the invention of things can also be lectured or introduced to children at appropriate times</p>
<p>㈩㈠ The power of children in Grades 1 and 2 is limited, so attention should be paid to the work process and good results should not be demanded</p>
<p>㈩㈡ In Grades 3 and 4, children should be fully empowered to use their own power to meet their own needs. Guidance on working methods, tool management, repair, and usage methods must be emphasized</p>
<p>㈩㈢ In Grades 5 and 6, although children should be urged to strictly apply working methods to achieve excellent results, the economical process, ingenious creativity is still more important than excellent results</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education yesterday consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government that the ten provisional regulations on the organization of social education institutions in Jiangsu Province previously approved and sent for consultation, except for the provisional regulations on the organization of county-level lecture halls in Jiangsu Province and the provisional regulations on the appointment, removal, and treatment of directors, should be transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for separate formulation (the scope is too large, such as the director having five directors below, which is difficult to implement. The director does not need to submit a request to the Department of Education for appointment. It can be visited by the public school principal's office and hired by the competent county educational administrative agency). The remaining eight have been filed by the department.</p>

<p>The Righteous Army's Telegrams and Letters Requesting Aid are as Urgent as Flying Sparks; Our Nation's People Share the Same Hatred of the Enemy, How Can We Bear to Sit Idle?</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Association telegraphed the national education community, stating through the Shanghai newspaper offices to all provincial and municipal education associations: "Regrettably, since the fall of the Northeast, over a year has swiftly passed. The Japanese invaders have been employing treacherous schemes but have failed to govern the Northeast, and their puppet government's organization has failed to establish a foundation. This is all due to the righteous volunteers of the Northeast shedding blood and fighting! The spirit of our righteous volunteers sacrificing for the nation is truly enough to surpass the past and present, and move heaven and earth. However, after years of bloody battles, they have endured many hardships, and the supplies needed by the troops are often insufficient. To achieve complete success, they rely on rear support. Now, the north wind roars, the frontier is bitterly cold, and ice and snow rage. Funding is scarce, and letters and telegrams requesting aid are as urgent as flying sparks. Moreover, the enemy and rebels are pressing in with large forces, and fierce battles have already begun. Assistance is even more urgent. Our nation's people share the same hatred of the enemy. How can we bear to sit idle and remain indifferent? In the past, the fundraising movement to aid the righteous volunteers has risen like a storm in various places. We colleagues in the education community, being intellectuals, how can we be willing to fall behind? Based on this principle, our association convened a meeting of representatives from major primary and secondary schools across the city on November 23, and passed eight fundraising methods. Since actively promoting fundraising from November 25, the results have been remarkable, demonstrating that saving the country is the common desire of all people. We have long admired your association's leadership of education throughout the province and city. If you can raise your voice from a high place, it will surely be like... Therefore, we hope that everyone will work together to overcome difficulties, and the future of the country will truly depend on it. Respectfully submitting this telegram for your consideration.

The meeting was opened as scheduled, and the following matters were discussed: ㈠ The case regarding the date of the winter regular meeting of the current administrative committee was discussed and decided to be held at 2 PM on December 28. ㈡ The case in which Educational Committee Member Niu forwarded the request of Wu Zhaozhi Primary School to raise funds to add classrooms and planned to repay the association's loan in installments with tuition income for record-keeping was discussed and decided to be feasible in fact. However, using operating expenses to repay the association's loan can only be used to offset the surplus amount, and the original tuition fees must not be diverted, which would hinder the budget. ㈢ The case in which Educational Committee Member Niu forwarded the request of Wu Zhaozhi Primary School to add classes and hire a formal teacher in the elementary school period for verification was discussed and decided that it involved adjustments to the budget and was difficult to approve. It should be handled again when the annual budget is prepared. ㈣ The case in which Educational Committee Member Niu reviewed the report that Peicai Primary School in the second district used purchased civilian houses as school buildings was discussed and decided to send a letter to the Second District Office to judge that the civilian houses were not suitable and should be postponed. ㈤ The case in which Educational Committee Member Niu forwarded the request for the allocation of temporary funds for Xinmin Primary School was discussed and decided that there were no funds available and it was difficult to approve. ㈥ The case in which Tangwan Minjiao Yi presented the organizational charter of the member committee and requested verification was discussed and decided to revise and implement it.

<h3 id="e165">Representatives of the French Concession Private School Association Paid Respects to Mayor Wu Yesterday <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Received by Secretary Geng of the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Requests for Subsidies are Not a Problem</p>
<p>Broadcasting and Lectures Can be Postponed</p>
<p>The United Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the French Concession of this port sent three representatives, Ma Jiazhen, Hong Guang, and Song An, to the Municipal Government at 10 AM yesterday to pay respects to Mayor Wu. Later, Secretary Geng of the Municipal Government received them in place of the mayor, who had not yet arrived. The representatives stated the purpose of requesting subsidies for private schools from the French Municipal Council and that the British Concession authorities' prohibition of the association's broadcasting and lectures was considered inappropriate, requesting that a protest be filed. Secretary Geng immediately replied to the representatives with several points: ㈠ Regarding the request for subsidies from the French Municipal Council, he had consulted with the French Consul a few days ago, and the French Consul immediately agreed to ask the Chinese directors to raise it in the budget meeting, and the French authorities would definitely not object. He met with the French Consul again yesterday and mentioned this matter, and the French Consul said that the Chinese directors had not yet raised it, so the focus of this matter is now on whether the Chinese directors can raise it in the meeting. Since you have come to contact me today, I will visit the Chinese directors Zhang Xiaolin and Zhu Yan in the next few days. ㈡ Regarding broadcasting and lectures, he will contact the Public Concession authorities in the near future to request permission to hold them. However, broadcasting and lectures should be held at an appropriate time and do not need to be postponed for the time being. The results of the contact will be notified to the Municipal Education Bureau for notification to everyone. The representatives were quite satisfied and immediately returned to the association.</p>

<p>(Former Training Director and Editor of the Jiangsu Provincial Martial Arts Hall)</p>
<p>— Jin Yiming</p>
<p>㈢ Fencing</p>
<p>"Fencing" is the art of striking and stabbing with a sword. The Book of Han, Sima Xiangru, Xiangru, studied "fencing" while reading. Later generations used knives to... "chop and stab". The Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue records that Yue Nu saw the King of Yue "King of Yue" and said: "What about the way of the sword?" The woman said: "I was born in the deep forest and grew up in the uninhabited wilderness. I have no way to learn or... The princes secretly like the way of striking and reciting it endlessly. I did not receive it from others, but suddenly I have it myself." King Yue said: "How is the way?" The woman said: "The way is very subtle and easy, and its meaning is profound and deep. The way of hand-to-hand combat is "internal reality, spirit, and external appearance of peace and ceremony." "Seeing it is like sweeping well, and seizing it is like fearing a tiger." One person is equal to a hundred, and a hundred people are equal to ten thousand. This statement deeply captures the essence of "fencing." From this, we can know the origin of "fencing" in our country has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi's Saying on Swords discusses the way of the sword, saying that one must "show it with emptiness and open it with profit," "follow it with development and arrive first." The words are simple but the meaning is comprehensive and deeply insightful. The Biography of Jing Ke says that Goujian heard that Jing Ke's assassination of the King of Qin failed and privately said: "Alas, what a pity that he did not study the art of stabbing with a sword." This shows that the art of fencing in the past had reached a profound level. Even Jing Ke was said to have not studied the art of stabbing with a sword, implying that later generations only knew how to carry a zither and sword box, and could play the zither but could not fence. Emperor Wen of Wei's Preface to the Dian Lun said that he learned "fencing" when he was young, and he had many teachers. The methods of the four directions were the best in the capital. At the same time, Mr. Liu was also good at "fencing". He Liangchen's Chen Ji of the Ming Dynasty said: "The disorderly patterns of Zhuangzi, the rise and fall of the Law King, the response law of Mr. Liu, the lightning law of Black Ming Wang, and the methods of dispatching troops by Ma Qi, the sword skills of these five families may or may not have been passed down." From this, we know that there were not many skilled "fencing" experts in the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, He Liangchen felt that the so-called swordsmanship of the five families must also have some basis. The Sword Classic attached to Qi Jiguang's Jixiao Xinshu is a transcription of what Yu Dayou wrote. Dayou learned "Jingchu long sword" from Li Liangqin, so the principles described in his sword classic are to transform the sword skills into stick skills, and he said that stick skills are like the Four Books, and knives and guns are like the Six Classics. If one can master the stick, then the methods of various stabbing weapons can be obtained from this. I compare boxing to character blocks, and sticks, knives, guns, and swords to reading books, especially swords with double blades are the most difficult of the four. As for the length and size of the sword, I have seen detailed records in the examinations. The Knife and Sword Record records the year numbers of the past dynasties and the names of the swords that were made, which can also be verified one by one. These two books can also be seen in old bookstores.</p>
<p>㈣ Bayonet Fighting</p>
<p>The General Examination of Literature records that the families who use spears have seventeen different methods, and the spear methods are also different. The Yang family's twenty-six roads of flowered spear, the Ma family's spear, the Zha family's spear, the Zhang Fei spear, the Five Manifestations Divine Spear, the Crutch Spear, the Crutch Blade Spear, the Javelin Spear, the Hammer Spear, the Renning Brush Spear, the Anti-Horse Spear, the Surprise Spear, the Emei Spear, the Sha family's eighteen strikes, the inverted pole, the Golden Dart, and the Ground Tongue Spear, totaling seventeen types. The Biography of Wang Yanzhang in the History of the Five Dynasties says that Yanzhang was brave and powerful, able to walk barefoot on thorns for a hundred steps, holding an iron spear and riding and speeding, rushing forward as fast as flying, and others could not hit him. The army called him Wang Iron Spear. The Biography of Li Quan in the History of the Song Dynasty says that Quan was agile in archery and horsemanship, and could wield a lance. At the time, he was known as Li Iron Spear. His wife, Zhao, said to Zheng Yande: "For twenty years, the pear blossom spear has been invincible under heaven." Later, Qi Jiguang trained soldiers, taking the essence and removing the dross from the Yang family's spear methods, and adopted the General Remarks on Long Spears. It says that the method of the long spear began with the Yang family, and it is called the pear flower. The world admires it. The key is to be familiar with it. "If you are familiar with it, your heart can forget your hand, and your hand can forget the spear, round and spiritual without stagnation. It is also most important to be quiet." If you are quiet, your heart will not move rashly, and you can deal with it calmly, with unpredictable changes and infinite divinity." The methods that are practiced in the world today are all the methods of the Sha family and the Ma family. The Sha family's pole and the Ma family's long spear each have their own wonderfulness and have differences in length. Their use is only the method of the Yang family, which has reality and falsehood, and has oddity and uprightness. Its advance is sharp and its retreat is fast, its momentum is dangerous and its section is short. It does not move like a mountain, and it moves like thunder. Therefore, it is said that the pear blossom spear has been invincible under heaven for twenty years. Chen Ji's Yang family's pear blossom spear is better than the Zha family's spear, the Sha family's pole, and the Li family's short spear. However, Qi Dongmou said that it is different when applied to the marching array. Its meaning is that when facing a large array, strength must not be given priority, and weakness must not be given priority. When using the spear, the method should be simple and the establishment should be sparse. If it is not simple, it will not be able to distinguish disputes, and if it is not sparse, it will not be able to observe and move forward and retreat. This is the main force of the spear method used in the battlefields of the past.</p>
<p>Now, the Central Martial Arts Hall adopts "bayonet fighting" as the great spear, but "splitting and stabbing" is still unknown. Only the spear is the main weapon, and the spear method says, "Your spear stabs me, I strike your spear. If your spear doesn't move, my spear will fire. The spear is... the waist lock is the first to stab the hands and feet. The high doesn't stab, the side doesn't save the middle. Don't be afraid of the empty spear. It's difficult to lift the stand with one spear. If you circle, I will also circle, but I'm afraid that the hand is too late to go like an arrow and come like a line, pointing at people's throats and wrinkled faces, and stabbing people without seeing it.</p>
<p>Master Fu Chuanru once told me the song and decision, saying, "When using the spear at Chen Shi, the sun is in the east, occupying the east to commit adultery and use attack. When using the spear at noon, the sun is in the south, don't teach the sun to meet you with both spears. When using the spear at You Shi, the sun is in the west, occupying the west to see the height. When using the spear in June, you must avoid the sun, and when using the spear in December, you must avoid the wind." I have carefully described what I know. I hope that martial arts comrades will advance and teach it.</p>

<p>丨Regarding Uniform Reports and Player Matters丨</p>
<p>㈠ Each team's players must wear the same jersey with numbers on the back to be allowed to play. Each team manager is fully responsible for this matter and must ensure that there are no mismatched jerseys in the team to maintain a good appearance and the spirit of the association. If a team's jerseys are not uniform, the referee on the field has the right to refuse to start the game. Please take note.</p>
<p>㈡ The game report form should be submitted to the referee by each team manager immediately after the end of the game. It should not be delayed. The form should be filled in carefully and accurately for reference.</p>
<p>㈢ Matters such as using unregistered members or impostor players to join the game, or each member registering for two teams or joining two teams to play are related to sportsmanship and the reputation of the team. The person in charge of the team should pay close attention. If they knowingly violate the rules, they will be found to be despicable and immediately have their membership in the association revoked. If the supervisors in the association have conclusive evidence that such matters have been found in any team, they should file a protest and report to the association to maintain the spirit of the association.</p>
<p>Later, Qingguang Defeated John</p>
<h3 id="e173">57-36, B Team Wing Defeats Tongwen <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>No West Qing Basketball Games Tonight</p>

<p>At the beginning of the game, John took advantage of Qingguang's lack of preparation. Hou Xuemin scored three consecutive goals on the right wing and made one free throw. Chen Zhongfeng also scored a goal, and Wu Youlin also scored one point. Suddenly, John had ten points, while Qingguang had not yet scored. At this point, Qingguang only scored two points through two free throws. John was ahead 16-2. This was John's golden age.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Qingguang Quickly Catches Up <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Seeing the impending failure, Qingguang was prepared. Hou Xuemin was tightly guarded on the right wing. Hou Xuemin had a great effect. One block was missed, and the score increased. Qingguang scored six consecutive goals, scoring twelve points. At 14-16, they were only two points behind. The situation in the first half changed after Lin Zequn's two throws.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Latecomer Actually Takes the Lead <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, Qingguang took the lead. The score surpassed John, reaching 37-26, which was eleven points ahead. After 41-30, Qingguang rose rapidly, while John lingered in place. Hou Xuemin also had no development. The defenders were repeatedly sneaked in. As a result, Qingguang defeated John 57-36.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Donglu Wins Junior Football Championship <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan Communication) The Shandong Provincial Public Sports Field launched the winter football and basketball competition in 1932, divided into men's senior football and basketball, men's junior football and basketball, and women's basketball, which began on October 19th. This winter's weather is mild, which is a good football and basketball season. However, due to the student unrest, many men's senior football and basketball teams have withdrawn from the competition in the past two weeks, which is a pity. This week is the third week. Men's senior football and basketball, men's junior basketball, and women's basketball are divided into groups for round-robin matches due to the large number of participating teams. It will take two weeks to finish. However, only three schools participated in the men's junior football, and the first round-robin match was used. Donglu Junior High School defeated Provincial No. 1 Vocational School 12-0 in the first week, and then defeated Qilu Junior High School 7-0 this week, winning this year's championship and maintaining the honor of the 1931 winter football tournament. The other championships will be determined in two weeks. Judging from the results of the three weeks, those who compete for the men's senior football championship should belong to Jingcheng and the senior department of Qizhong. Boai defeated Qida this week and has hope of winning the basketball championship. The men's junior basketball championship is expected to be won by No. 1 Middle School Zhiyi, and the women's basketball championship may belong to the Women's Normal School. Now I will describe the battle between Donglu and Qizhong this week.</p>
<p>Donglu Wins Qizhong At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the two sides entered the field to practice shooting and passing. The referee, Wan Ruzhang Ziyao, blew the silver whistle. Qizhong was in the south and Donglu was in the north. Donglu attacked first. After the kick-off, Qizhong took the lead. Donglu reorganized its troops and launched a counterattack, repeatedly attacking the city. Then, Donglu drove straight in and brought the ball into the goal. At the end of the first half, Donglu won four goals, all brought into the goal. At the beginning of the second half, Qizhong tried to counterattack and was full of energy. It attacked Donglu's goal several times, but the shots were weak and were easily thrown out by Donglu's goalkeeper. Donglu reorganized its troops and advanced again. Qizhong's forwards retreated and defended desperately. Donglu's center repeatedly dribbled the ball to the goal, but failed to succeed. Finally, Qizhong's two goals were too weak and the gate was unable to prevent Donglu from scoring two consecutive goals. Before 30 minutes, they scored another goal. Then, the silver whistle blew and the war ended. The final result was 7-0, Donglu won. Donglu won the first vocational school. Qizhong won the championship. The first vocational school defeated Qizhong 2-1 and won the runner-up. The junior football ended here.</p>

<p>Commercial News Finance Financial Gold Market Volatility is Strong</p>
<h3 id="e179">Three Taels of Continuous Decline <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market was turbulent and the volatility was very strong. The momentum was really unstoppable. In the early market, the silver market and foreign exchange rose sharply. It was heard that the low-end offshore exchange rate was also loose. Later, it became even more sluggish. It was heard that the news that the United States insisted on absolute compensation for war debts and would not reach its goal strengthened the minds of colleagues. The market suddenly flew like Meng Jin and quickly recovered the 800 tael mark. However, there was a strong difference of ten taels in the morning and noon, and the fluctuations in the middle were also frequent. After the supply and demand were chaotic, the market turned in the opposite direction. The foreign exchange still tended to be sluggish, and it was rumored that the British and American debts might still be repaid, so the gold price was not easy to support and continued to decline.</p>
<p>The selling atmosphere of various firms was full, and finally 792 and a half taels were seen. There was also a rebound of ten taels. Finally, it recovered slightly and pulled up three or four taels. Overall, compared with the day before yesterday, it continued to depreciate by three taels, which is no less than a big rise and a small pullback. Now, the detailed situation of the whole day is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e180">Fluctuations of Ten Taels in the Early Market <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>

Suddenly, HSBC sold British gold in February at 0.0625 and American gold in March at 0.375 for hedging to Huabi. Yifeng Yongda Decheng Yifeng sold to 9:10 AM for six taels and eight qian. Maihang absorbed 0.375 in March and only settled 0.125 in January. Richang Qianchang Xiang Hengyu Yuantai and others came to enter and returned to two taels, and at 9:30 AM it was nine taels and two qian. HSBC posted British flat and American long 0.125. After the gold price stabilized, Sassoon sold American gold at 0.25 in February. Citibank came out with 0.25 in January, and the market gradually went downstream. Hengyu Dachen Hengxing Yuanmao Yong Yifeng Fuyu Yuantai Yuanchun and others sold very hard, and by 11:00 AM only ninety-three and a half taels were counted. At this time, American gold in January could be settled at 0.3125 (however, from 9:30 to 11:00, the head of the market was only one tael). Suddenly, news came that the United States was determined to repay war debts, so the market suddenly reached its peak. Hengxing Bingxing Zhaofeng Chang Yongfeng Qianheng Yuantai Futai Heng Hengyu Wanxing Yuansheng Yong and others were all surging and competing to buy. American gold was also tight, and January only settled at 0.125 and March at 0.25. The price soared by more than ten taels, reaching 804 taels and zero in the afternoon. Many long positions took the opportunity to sell, and Leeson was half a tael and zero two and a half taels. When the noon closed at zero two taels and seven qian, it was done again to three taels.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Stronger Selling in the Afternoon Market <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at zero two taels, followed by two and a half taels. When it was learned that the UK was preparing to pay off its debts to the US, the hearts of the people were shaken. Yifeng Yong Hengyu Hengxing Yuan and others sold off and retreated to seven taels, and at 2:50 PM it was 95 taels. Shortly after, Yuanheng Hengxing came to enter. After 3:30 PM, it was 97 taels. In a flash, Yifeng Yong Hengxing Dachen Hongli and others vigorously sold off, and HSBC came out with American gold at 0.25 in January, so in a few minutes it fell by more than four taels.

Huabi absorbed 0.375 in February and British gold at 0.193125 in April, and then added four taels. At 4:09 PM it was 96 taels and seven qian, then it retreated by more than one tael to 95 and a half taels. When the market closed at 4:30 PM, it was 96 taels and eight qian, which was three taels lower than the day before yesterday. However, it has fallen only ten taels in four consecutive days. After closing, it was redone at about seven taels. According to the full day, the maximum was 804 taels and the minimum was 792 and a half taels, a difference of eleven and a half taels. The bare strip was still increased by ten taels and seventy-five. The price was quoted at 0.125 for American gold, so it was 869 taels. Calculating 70 taels to 75 taels, the noon closed at 65-6 taels, and in the afternoon, 66 taels and later 76 taels. The result was 72 taels, which was one tael less than the previous day. However, there was a double settlement price in the front and back markets. The registration was 04 taels to 03 taels in the morning and 98 taels to 97 taels in the afternoon.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report Monday (5th) The New York stock market fell first and then rose. The repeal of the alcohol prohibition case was rejected by Congress, and the decline suddenly started. Stocks related to the alcohol prohibition fell miserably, especially Amos bottles fell by 5 yuan, and Crohn bottles fell by 3 yuan. Then, due to the high rise of wheat, short sellers urgently made up for it, and the market situation changed from fatigue to firmness. As a result, the prices were slightly better than the previous day. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 700,000 shares. Looking at the recent stock market movements, it is obvious that it is brewing. It is predicted that there may be an upsurge after the political situation is clear.

<p>According to a report from Mei Bing Silver Company, the New York stock market on Monday this week continued the fatigue of the past few days. The early situation was still poor, and the market fell quite a lot. After that, the shorts took the opportunity to cover their positions, and the atmosphere in the market improved. The market price then revolved upward, and the ending was slightly higher than Saturday. Coca-Cola shares rose by 3.5 yuan from the previous day, which was the best. The commodity market was still good, and American wheat increased quite a lot, but the cotton market continued to be tired, and the rest were mediocre. Looking at the trend of the stock market from fatigue to firmness on Monday, it may be possible to establish an upward foundation from this. At present, the focus of all parties seems to be concentrated on national financial issues and economic policies, and the commercial situation is turning out to be insignificant.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>The yarn market reveals a tendency to be pretty</p>
<p>The Shanghai yarn factory plans to jointly discuss stopping night work</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation reveals a slight firming trend. Because the Shanghai yarn factory is scheduled to convene an industry meeting today, there is a saying that it will stop night work and reduce production, which has aroused speculation by speculators, and the market has slightly risen. However, the actual demand is still sluggish, and the end of the year is approaching in a blink of an eye. The money market feels more difficult, so there is less hope for yarn sales from all parties. The observation of the next step is not promising. However, at present, it has become a situation where the flower interest rate is cheap for yarn manufacturers are in trouble. The short side is restricted by one and it is heard that the Hubei yarn factory has already shortened its work hours.</p>
<p>The recent standard is good for nine qian. People bid before the market. The opening market was initially flat. The outer cotton fell slightly, and there were not many sellers in the market. Then, the yarn factory stopped the late work, which was very noisy, and the people were agitated. Each month rose by one, two, four, and six qian. The afternoon market situation was even tighter, and the opening step rose. Each month rose again by two, three, and five qian. Whether the suspension of work problem will be realized remains to be decided at today's meeting. The total transactions for the whole day were 19,500 bales. It was found that Yichang sold 1,600 bales, Suilong 550 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Shenji 450 bales, and Rongxing 450 bales.

<p>Lack of Spot Chips, Short Side Advances in the Near Term</p>
<p>The cotton market is getting stronger, but the trend of US cotton is still weak, and the gold market is also calm. However, due to the weak stock base in this port and the telegrams from various production areas indicating that the shipments are less than before, the market price is upside down. As a result, the source is declining, and the short side sees that there is a lack of spot chips, so it temporarily advances the near-term amount, and the market atmosphere is even tighter. The distant months are brought up. However, the yarn factory has a reduction in working hours due to the tired market price. If it is realized, it will inevitably have an impact at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Australian Wheat Is Sold Very Hard</p>
<p>Factories Slightly Have a File</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the various months generally showed a flat appearance. The quotation for foreign wheat rebounded by about 1 or 2 jiao. However, the gold market was slightly缓和. Although the factory did not file, the foreign wheat continued to be fixed, and people inevitably hesitated. Therefore, the near term was still good, and the far term was tired. When the afternoon market opened, the near and far terms fell in unison. Australian foreign wheat was sold very hard. The price of those with bags was fixed at 7,000 tons, with a price of 3 taels, 5 qian and a half. The price of those without bags was only 3 taels, 4 qian and 5, 6, and 7 fen. Because of this situation, people's hearts naturally softened, and factories also slightly issued files. Therefore, the near and far terms fell sharply in unison. Foreign wheat is still economical, and it is feared that the declining wind will still be unavoidable in the future. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li from the previous day, January fell by 1 fen and 7 li, February and March fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, April fell by 2 fen and a half, and May fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li.</p>

<p>Although there are few spot chips, it is difficult to be too profitable</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the various months generally showed a stable and fluctuating appearance. The quotation for foreign wheat rebounded by 1 or 2 jiao, so the hearts of the various markets were slightly stabilized. However, the sales of foreign wheat continued, and buyers could not avoid concerns. Therefore, although the spot chips were still scarce, it was finally unable to be too profitable. At present, traders have begun to order foreign wheat, or there will be hedging people. As a result, January was good for 1 fen, February was good for 2 fen, April was small for 1 fen, and the rest had no comparison.</p>

<p>Xiamen Tangerine Cake Was Transported Yesterday</p>
<p>Xiamen tangerine cakes were in short supply due to few sources, and the goods that had been stored in the stores had already been sold out, and there were not many stores in the local area. Because the Shanghai market has been tired for a long time, there have been no shipments. It was found that the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel imported a batch from Xiamen yesterday, and the total number is unknown. At most, it will not exceed 20 or 30 pieces.</p>
<p>Coal Fuzhou Coal Dust Sales Are Stagnant</p>
<p>The sales of Fuzhou white coal dust have been stagnant recently, so the market price has fallen secretly. Yesterday, the market opened 80 tons, and the price was only 7 taels and 7 qian and a half per ton, which was 5 qian lower than before. It was found that there were not many stocks in this port, and the statistics were only more than 2,000 tons, so the market price is not likely to fall again for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Ways to Order Foreign Wheat · Zhi · De <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The huge amount of foreign wheat shipped in recent years has occupied a very important position in imported goods, second only to rice, with a value of hundreds of millions. The decline in domestic wheat production is undeniable, and the encouragement of production by overseas wheat-producing countries has led to a surge in production, and the method of dumping has to be used. My country's tariff barriers are weak and have been subjected to foreign economic aggression for a long time. Free competition has been unrestrictedly. Looking back, wheat production has declined to an incalculable level. Recently, if the factories do not import foreign wheat, they will all shut down. The serious state has already been seen. It is better to have major agricultural provinces, either suffering from the disaster of soldiers and bandits, or suffering from water and drought disasters, or even suffering from bad politics</p>
<p>The oppression of fertile farmland is changed to planting panic, the agricultural time is lost, and the production is less. Recalling the time of the Republic of China, Sichuan Province</p>
<p>The amount of wheat arriving in Shanghai was about 300,000 to 400,000. At that time, the Shanghai flour factory was just starting, and the cheap wheat and expensive flour created a boom. Subsequently, the wheat production in Henan (the most) and Hubei provinces was concentrated in Hankou and came to Shanghai one after another. The Anhui North area is also a rich wheat-producing area, and most of Shanghai is the end. Knowing that after 20 years, Sichuan is nothing</p>
<p>Even Hankou wheat is almost extinct. The wheat from Anhui coming from the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River is not as smooth as before the Republic of China. Accumulating this kind of flour mills in the port, except for the new wheat season, can still cope, otherwise, they must rely on foreign wheat. Today, they have formed a panic that cannot be maintained without the import of foreign wheat. This kind of food crisis for the people cannot be solved without extremely good politics.</p>
<p>Calculation of Pricing The procedure for ordering foreign wheat is quite simple and the calculation is absolutely convenient. That is, the foreign quotation obtained by the foreign merchants and the exchange rate on the same day are converted into the number of guiyuan. If the two parties are close, the transaction can be concluded. It is determined to order American wheat and Canadian wheat. The wheat is numbered from 1 to 5, and 2 to 3 are the most. The foreign market price is based on each ton (ie 2,000 pounds) (equivalent to 15 dan) as a unit. Assuming that the quotation for American wheat is US$17 per ton (including water feet and commission, Shanghai delivery, starting at US$30 for exchange, converted into Shanghai guiyuan is 56 taels, 6 qian and 6 fen, divided by 15 dan to get 3 taels, 7 qian and 8 fen per dan in Shanghai guiyuan). If you want to order Canadian wheat, you can also use this method. The only difference between Canadian wheat and American wheat is that American wheat is 2,000 pounds per ton, while Canadian wheat is 2,240 pounds (ie 16 dan and 80 jin). When ordering wheat from various ports in Australia, it is not divided into grades, but the weight of each bushel (British container) is used as the standard. Ordinary goods weigh 60 pounds, followed by 58 pounds, and as high as 62 pounds. When ordering, both parties specify a pound amount, and the order indicates that if there is insufficient weight upon arrival, there are official regulations that lower the price. The calculation method assumes that each British pound (2,240 pounds) is 5 pounds, 4 shillings and 6 pence, which is 1,254 pence. Assuming an exchange rate of 1 shilling and 9 pence, it is equal to 59 taels, 7 qian and 1 fen in Shanghai guiyuan. Divide by 16 dan and 80 jin to get 3 taels, 5 qian and 5 fen and zero (price per dan). If the futures quotations for Chicago Canadian foreign wheat are mentioned, the industry generally calculates 333, and most people in the 333 principle are unclear. It must be known that 333 is 33.3 bushels (the first bushel of 60 pounds is suitable for 2,000 pounds). This is different from the nature of spot goods for the futures standard price. Because the spot price and the standard are often inconsistent, it is just a trend for the industry to understand. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>One afternoon, I went to visit a contemporary famous painter, Mr. S.</p>
<p>The painter was working at his desk. Seeing me, he didn't put down his brush, but his mouth was entertaining me. He told many stories about painting. I don't understand art, so I just listened to him silently. He occasionally mentioned the so-called genius of art. I have never believed in any kind of genius, so I slightly refuted him. The painter put down his brush and began to seriously discuss the issue of genius with me.</p>
<p>His argument failed to convince me because I am someone who absolutely does not easily abandon my own views.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. S, with a contemptuous look, began to tell a story.</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a painter (the person telling the story mentioned a very familiar name, but I forgot it)," he began, "who was the best at painting beauties. But his works were rarely appreciated."</p>
<p>"One day, a powerful person held a grand banquet, inviting countless contemporary literati and artists. This painter was of course invited as well."</p>
<p>"At the appointed time, he arrived. During the banquet, they talked about many anecdotes about literati or painting. When they talked about the present, everyone praised his skill in painting beauties. So the painter, in a triumphant mood, drank a few more glasses of wine and was already somewhat drunk."</p>
<p>"After the banquet, the host suggested leaving a souvenir, asking each of the literati and painters present to show off their skills. Some wrote poems, some painted, and finally it was his turn to paint a beauty. But he was drunk, dazedly and vaguely listening to the praises of the people around him. He was a little afraid. He was afraid that under the influence of alcohol, he would not be able to paint a meticulous masterpiece."</p>
<p>"People urged him, and he was still hesitating. Finally, with trembling hands, he picked up the brush. He began to draw the outline of a young woman's face on the prepared white paper. Hazy eyes and trembling hands could not do as he wished. He felt a little annoyed. He hated the people around him who were forcing him to write."</p>
<p>"After finishing the face, he didn't want to continue painting. Now, the young woman's face on the white paper, seen through his drunken eyes, had no vitality at all. His annoyance shifted to the person in the painting."</p>
<p>He thought to himself that the existence of this young woman's face would ruin his reputation, and he became even more angry.</p>
<p>"Picking up the brush again, he applied thick ink and brushed it twice on the face. As if mad, under the dumbfounded gaze of the crowd, he strode away."</p>
<p>"All night, the painter couldn't sleep, remorse tormenting his heart. He even thought that he would never pick up a brush again."</p>
<p>"The next morning, as he was painfully tossing and turning in bed, he heard a chaotic sound of people outside the house. His friends pulled him out of bed."</p>
<p>"It turned out that his friends had come specifically to congratulate him on his success last night. Last night, after he ran away in a frenzy, people didn't understand his mood. After being stunned for a while, they all turned their eyes to the young woman's face. At this time, they discovered a miracle. The two strokes of thick ink that he wanted to use to destroy the face in anger appeared on the young woman's cheeks, just like two thick dabs of rouge, and these two dabs of rouge made the face even more vivid, surpassing the achievements of all his previous beauty paintings."</p>
<p>"From then on, in addition to his reputation for being good at painting beauties, the painter also gained a reputation for being good at painting rouge."</p>
<p>Mr. S finished his story here. He further argued:</p>
<p>"Do you still not believe in the so-called genius of art? You must explain this story as accidental. Yes, it is indeed accidental, but why can this kind of accident only happen in the hands of that painter?"</p>
<p>I stared blankly, smoking a cigarette. I had no words to answer him.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Freedom <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Hành</p>
<p>"Freedom," in this world, it is said to truly exist. However, after all, its nature is too mysterious and wonderful, vague and indistinct, like a wisp of green smoke, or like a sweet dream. As soon as you reach out, the smoke dissipates from your hand, and the dream vanishes from your memory. Your hand is empty, grasping nothing. Therefore, until now, "freedom" has remained just a faint shadow, seeming to exist yet not quite.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the world is full of clever people. Occasionally, a kite soars into the sky, or a fish leaps out of the water. The clever people then exclaim with a sense of discovery: "Look, freedom is right here, actively present in this lively natural mechanism!" And even cleverer people declare with even greater certainty: "Give me not liberty, but give me death!"</p>
<p>But when it comes to death, it is ultimately not as easy as "a kite flying" or "a fish leaping." Sometimes, when you want to die, you are not allowed to. Just as when you want to live, you are not allowed to. "Not allowing you to live" is very easy to prove with an example right before our eyes, so there's no need to elaborate. And by the banks of the Huangpu River in Shanghai and on the Yanziji cliffs in Nanjing, it is said that stone tablets have been erected that read "Thou Shalt Not Die!" And suicide, it is said, violates some law, article so-and-so, number so-and-so. Hmph! Do you think you are free to die?</p>
<p>Even though the sea is so vast and the sky is so empty, kites and fish must still be constantly vigilant. Because among the myriad things, there is ultimately a distinction between "strong" and "weak." The strong can arbitrarily set up a fence on the sea surface and in the sky, forbidding you to fly, forbidding you to leap. If you want to act at all freely, you will very easily find yourself caught in a well-laid net!</p>
<p>Therefore, during the Qin Shi Huang era, no one dared to "whisper," nor did anyone dare to "collect books." Everyone suppressed themselves with all their might, pressing themselves flat and stuffing themselves into a wall crack that allows entry but no exit. This is because there was no one willing to reach out and grasp the ungraspable smoke, and death, after all, is somewhat frightening.</p>
<p>But the First Emperor's net was finally broken by the people in the wall cracks. Here, it cannot be said that "freedom" has truly been grasped, but if the people in the wall cracks break through a few more nets, perhaps one day when they reach out, their hand will not be forever empty!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Soviet Russian Kindergartens <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Duo</p>
<p>Soviet Russian kindergartens are divided into many ethnic groups, such as Tatars, Cossacks, Ukrainians, and Glozhen. Each ethnic group has its own unique customs and habits, so children's education must be specially tailored to enable cultural education to be successful after they become adults. Children with illnesses, such as disabilities or deformities, are grouped separately and given appropriate education to facilitate correction. There are also ordinary children's groups. Each group is divided into day and night classes. Children whose parents work during the day are sent to the kindergarten in the morning and picked up in the evening; those whose parents work at night are sent to the kindergarten in the evening and picked up at midnight. Each group has two caregivers with quasi-teacher status who are dedicated to looking after them.</p>
<p>When children enter the kindergarten, they are first inspected by the caregivers to ensure they are clean. Children who are not clean are told to go to the washroom and wash themselves. Younger children are helped by the caregivers. Each child has their own washing utensils, such as soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste. After everyone has finished washing, they put their utensils in a one-foot-high cupboard. Everything has its designated place, in an orderly manner, without any confusion. In the dining hall, there are chairs and tables specially designed for children, which they can easily move themselves. The plates, dishes, spoons, and cups are all very small. Each table has a class leader, elected by the children themselves. Mealtimes and tea times are supervised by the class leader and cared for by the caregivers, with very little squabbling over food. The furnishings in the club are similar to those in the playroom, but on a larger scale. The pictures on the walls are arranged in a very orderly manner, with portraits of Lenin in the center, and photographs of Soviet Russian celebrities such as Stalin and Molotov, as well as other slogans suitable for children, such as "Down with the family kitchen," "Make toys when young, build cars when old," "Help parents build socialism," "Complete the five-year plan in four years," and so on.</p>
<p>There is a special pharmacy for children's own use, containing iodine, boric acid ointment, bandages, cotton wool, rubber plaster, and so on. If a child has a minor injury, another child will apply the medicine and bandage it for them.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many small workshops, such as woodworking, carpentry,</p>
<p>, painting, and sand casting. The tools are also specially made and children can work on whatever they want. There are also models of airplanes and cars in the display room, which they can play with as they wish. The sports field is located outdoors and has various kinds of sports equipment for children. The equipment in the bedroom is similar to that in an infant ward, except that the beds are made of wood and have railings. The number of people sleeping in each bedroom is determined by the doctor based on the size of the room. Older children must make their own beds when they get up. The music room has various kinds of musical instruments for children to use, and they are allowed to play whatever instrument they like, without being stopped by the caregivers.</p>
<p>The daily routine of the children is as follows: 7:30 am wake up (children who do not live in the kindergarten enter between 7:30 am and 8:00 am), 8:00 am wash, 8:30 am breakfast, 9:00 am work. The type of work is determined by age. Work time is 40 minutes. At 10:00 am, they go for a walk in the garden or play various games in the sports field. At 11:00 am, they return to the kindergarten. At 12:00 pm, they have lunch and wash. 12:30 pm is nap time. 2:30 pm wake up, 3:00 pm work, 4:00 pm have snacks, and after 4:00 pm is playtime. 7:30 pm go home, earlier in winter and spring. 8:00 pm dinner. The equipment and layout in the kindergarten are very perfect. There are children's education experts in charge of the kindergarten affairs, and they often hold meetings and talks with the children's parents to discuss how to improve children's education. The local education committee supervises the kindergarten. Sometimes, staff from the kindergarten lead children to visit nearby factories, workshops, farms, or museums.</p>
<p>Most of the kindergarten's expenses are borne by the state. The children's parents only pay a small amount of money, or it is completely free for families in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Kindergartens also sign contracts with each other to compete with each other, and the good things are published in newspapers to attract children who have not yet entered the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Kindergarten children are from three to eight years old. Children over the age of eight are sent to elementary school.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Heredity of Talent <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Much of a person's talent is inherited. For example, musical talent is often evident from a young age. This is undoubtedly due to genetic inheritance. German composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) had reached a level of maturity in his musical talent by the age of twenty-two. Beethoven at thirteen, and Mendelssohn Felix (1809-1847) at fifteen, both published their compositions. Furthermore, Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) was able to compose at the age of five.</p>
<p>The Bach family produced more than twenty famous musicians, as well as more than forty ordinary musicians. This cannot but be attributed to heredity.</p>
<p>The precise heredity of musical talent has not yet been fully understood. According to Harst, the hereditary factor for music is recessive rather than dominant. Based on a comprehensive study of a large number of families, the hereditary situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If both parents have special musical talent (whether vocal or instrumental), then their children may have special musical talent, or they may have ordinary musical talent.</p>
<p>(2) If neither parent has musical talent, and the grandparents (one or both) also lack musical talent, then none of the children will have musical talent.</p>
<p>(3) If one parent has special musical talent, and the other parent has ordinary musical talent, then their children's musical talent may be excellent, ordinary, or non-existent, in various combinations.</p>

<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>There are currently eight large ships in the world with a tonnage of over 40,000 tons. The longest of these is the British Majestic, which is 915 feet 5 inches long, with a total length from bow to stern of 954 feet 6 inches. This ship was originally the German Bismarck, but as a result of the war, it became British property.</p>
<p>In terms of tonnage, the American Leviathan is the largest, with 59,957 tons. This was originally the German Vaterland, which became American property after the war. It is 950 feet long, 104 feet high from keel to deck, has a draft of 39.5 feet, a displacement of 64,700 tons, can carry 3,400 passengers, and has a crew of 1,183 people. Its speed is 24 knots and its horsepower is 100,000. It carries approximately 9,300 tons of cargo. The walkways inside the ship are approximately two and a half miles long. There are 15,000 electric lights, with a total wire length of 5 miles. The chimney diameter is 32 feet. The fastest ships are the German Bremen and Europa. The planned speed of these two ships was originally 27 knots, but during testing, the average speed of both ships was over 28 knots. Their overall length is 938 feet 5 inches, their width is 101 feet 8 inches, their height is 97 feet 5 inches, their draft is 33 feet 7.5 inches, their horsepower is 92,500, they can carry 2,200 passengers, and the crew consists of 960 officers and sailors.</p>
<p>The purpose of building these two ships was to compete with Britain in crossing the Atlantic. The former took four days, seventeen hours, and forty-two minutes to cross the Atlantic, while the latter took four days, seventeen hours, and six minutes.</p>

<p>Haiquan had to turn back and sit in a corner of the living room. He saw a servant carrying a basket of dry firewood and a small lead bucket of white coal, walking towards the stove.</p>
<p>"The young mistress instructed that because the weather is cold today, and you're from the South and might not be able to bear it, we should light the stove..." Haiquan didn't feel particularly cold, but he didn't stop him either.</p>
<p>(Four)</p>
<p>The curtains in the bedroom of Master Ren and his wife were still tightly drawn, not a single ray of sunlight could penetrate. A light blue gauze cover was added to the large electric lamp hanging from the center of the ceiling, emitting a kind of faint light like the autumn moon. The snow-white silk mosquito net still covered their bed. When the maid sent the visiting card in, she heard the sound of flirting laughter and whispers from the couple inside the net.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin you mentioned the other day is here."</p>
<p>"Okay, please ask him to sit for a moment longer downstairs. We'll get up soon."</p>
<p>After the maid left, Peizhen struggled to get up, but Master Ren deliberately stopped her.</p>
<p>"Forget it. It's almost twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>She crawled out of the net, wearing a light peach-colored velvet pajama and a blue silk pants that reached just below the knees. She walked to the oval mirror stand, looked at her sleepy face, which had just woken up from a dream, to see if there were any flaws that shouldn't be seen by a man other than her husband. She looked at her face as she combed the tangled hair on her head. She smelled the fragrance of her hair. She thought, this is exactly one of the characteristics that her husband loves about her.</p>
<p>She began to wash, spending a full thirty minutes before finishing. At this time, her husband, Ren Jinhua, also got up and walked into the dressing room. He saw Peizhen concentrating on applying makeup in front of the vanity mirror, and couldn't help but stand behind her in a daze, stealing glances at her in the mirror.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at? Don't you recognize me?"</p>
<p>She stamped her foot and said coquettishly.</p>
<p>"You look even more beautiful today. Could it be..."</p>
<p>Jinhua smiled and picked up a toothbrush from the vanity, checking the Colgate toothpaste.</p>
<p>"You're talking nonsense again..."</p>
<p>She stretched her head back, and her whole body leaned against his chest.</p>
<p>"Go away, you're not allowed to be here!"</p>
<p>She said again in a spoiled tone. He ignored her and just kept smiling as he looked in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Stop fooling around, there's a guest downstairs. How can we keep him waiting?"</p>
<p>She finally stopped smiling and said to him seriously.</p>
<p>"I heard that your sister likes him a lot, he must be a handsome man, right? Is that why you're in such a hurry to see him?"</p>
<p>He said, finally letting go of her, allowing her to continue applying makeup.</p>
<p>After a while, she finished applying makeup and walked back to the room to change clothes. She chose a brightly colored plaid flannel qipao and her favorite pair of black patent leather high-heeled dancing shoes.</p>
<p>"I'll go downstairs and see what kind of handsome man he is..."</p>

<h3 id="e222">Women <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>People often talk about women. I think women are indeed worth talking about. A few days ago, it was said in the newspapers how French women are hardworking and thrifty, how Japanese women are patriotic and organize women's national defense corps, and how German women have gained status in society. These words are all true. Although French women love to apply rouge and powder, according to people who have lived there for a long time, at least 60 to 70 percent of French women are able to support themselves. After the war, there was an excess of women (here, let's use these two words tentatively). Especially when men choose spouses, their first condition is whether this woman can support herself.</p>
<p>Therefore, most women learn a profession during their single years, otherwise it is not easy to find a husband. It can be said that more than 90 percent of German women are able to support themselves. Looking back at Chinese women, we are truly beyond reach. Generally speaking, so-called educated modern women take reading as decoration in their girlhood, and luxury as glory. They go in and out of cinemas, dance halls, and social venues, considering themselves to be socialites. When they reach their twenties, they fall in love with a rich man, or a powerful noble, and become the wife of a celebrity, living a life more extravagant than that of queens and concubines.</p>
<p>On the man's side, regardless of wealth or poverty, the first condition for choosing a spouse is always the beauty of the face. As long as she is a flower-like maiden, he will marry her, even if he himself becomes a beast of burden, he will gladly endure it. This phenomenon has fostered the inferior nature of women relying on their husbands. Relying on their beautiful faces, they are not afraid of not finding a wealthy suitor.</p>
<p>Men, you all want to have a woman, right? And you want to have a so-called modern miss to be your woman, right? Before you have tasted her flavor, you are so passionately yearning for her, but I have to tell you, once you have her, you will add a lot of trouble. If you are a person with a bit of ambition, wanting to do something in this world, then it's terrible. Just her living expenses will be enough to make you dizzy and complain all day long.</p>
<p>If you raise a spoiled wife and don't want to become an official to make a fortune and squeeze the people's fat, you are truly the number one "wronged to death." Below that are those who, for the sake of their beautiful wives and concubines, become greedy and corrupt officials. In today's world, such people are everywhere, even schoolteachers, book writers, shop clerks, porters, and peddlers, few of whom are not slaves to women. Alas, women! However, the badness of women lies in men. Today, all the men in the country should issue an emergency general mobilization order. From this day and time onwards, regardless of beauty or ugliness, any woman who cannot support herself should not be taken as a wife. In this way, perhaps men will have some way out, and the so-called modern women will not dare to be coquettish and live their romantic lives any longer.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Tram <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>Trams are fast, convenient, and save money, so ordinary people like to ride them. Since we often ride them, how can we not know their principles? I will now introduce several tram principles below: (1) Rail tram</p>
<p>In the power plant, a generator is set up. When the generator rotates, it cuts across magnetic lines of force, generating current, which exits from the positive pole ↓</p>
<p>Overhead wires on the street ↓ Pole on the tram ↓ Starter box (the iron box in front of the driver) ↓ From the starter box ↓ DC motor at the bottom of the car ↓ Wheel and to the rail and back to the negative pole of the generator in the power plant. When the current reaches the motor, the motor rotates the wheels, and the car can move forward.</p>
<p>So how can the car be made to go faster or slower? This all depends on the function of the starter box. It can control the current from the generator, making it appropriate to determine the speed. In the starter box, there are metal strips, some with high resistance and some with low resistance. When you want the current to be weaker, you only need to connect the metal strip with high resistance to the circuit, and the current will be weaker. When you want the current to be stronger, you only need to connect the metal strip with low resistance to the circuit, and the current will be stronger. If you want to stop, you only need to disconnect the metal strip from the circuit, and the motor will stop when it does not receive current. The driver turns the wooden handle on the box with his hand, which means controlling the current. If you want the car to go backwards, you can only turn the small handle next to the large handle. This turn can cause current in the opposite direction to flow into the motor, causing the car to go backwards.</p>
<p>(2) Trolleybus</p>
<p>At first glance, trolleybuses are very strange. We may wonder, how can it run without a current circuit? But if you take a closer look at the differences between rail trams and trolleybuses, you will find their principle. Rail trams have a pole and an overhead wire; trolleybuses have two poles, and there are two overhead wires on top of it. One of its poles is equivalent to the function of the steel rail. When the current enters one pole from one overhead wire, to the motor, and from the other pole, the other overhead wire returns to the generator.</p>
<p>Sometimes the tram does not need overhead wires, and the electricity is hidden in the grooves of the track. This type of tram device does not yet exist in our country. Although it is more aesthetically pleasing on the surface, it is much more expensive.</p>

<p>— Sun Jingcheng</p>
<p>Nepal is located between Tibet and India, with pivotal importance. The National Government, due to the discord in Kangzang, feared that someone would induce Nepal to aid Tibet, so it specially sent Zhang Dingcheng as envoy to Nepal, carrying the Republic of China's gift of the Chinese Army General and First Class Baoding Medal to the Prime Minister and Grand Marshal of that country, as well as other gifts, to win them over. Therefore, I compose two seven-character regulated verses as follows:</p>
<p>Entrusted with credentials, an envoy sets out from China,</p>
<p>To confer medals and promote the general's grace.</p>
<p>In spring, the peaks rise high, viewing the Himalayas,</p>
<p>The distant star of the envoy illuminates the flowing sands.</p>
<p>Trust that Nepal will speak of reconciliation,</p>
<p>Zhang Qian is accustomed to sailing the raft.</p>
<p>Moreover, in years past, he served as a prominent official,</p>
<p>His praise extends to Java and India even now.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Relying entirely on prestige to intimidate the heavens,</p>
<p>The jade bowl and pearl plate offer superior tactics.</p>
<p>Cease speaking of the Five Rams opening up the barbarous lands,</p>
<p>Do not covet the Eight Steeds and the grapes.</p>
<p>Wherever the imperial envoy arrives, soldiers and people rejoice,</p>
<p>Courtesy befitting the praise of the monarch and minister.</p>
<p>From now on, there is no need for western anxieties,</p>
<p>Across the vast ocean, ten thousand miles of tranquil winds and waves.</p>
<h3 id="e225">What is Love? <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ying</p>
<p>The Sacrifices of Zongcheng, Each with Their Own Merits</p>
<p>Thinking back to six years ago, when I was studying at M school, the students' conversations always revolved around the word "love." They researched and explored it as if it held endless fascination. In particular, Miss S from my class was the most eloquent, and could be considered the guide to love in our M school. At that time, I was only fifteen years old, and what did I know about love? Naturally, I had to ask the guide, Miss S! I asked her to tell me the meaning of love, but she seemed unwilling to answer me in detail. At this moment, her face flushed red, and she lowered her head. After a long time, she said, "You will naturally understand one day when you reach a suitable age." How strange, how could she see the word "love" as so mysterious, and didn't I have the qualifications to talk about love?</p>
<p>I remember one evening, my younger brother and I were strolling in V Park, and just as we were about to pass a large tree, the sound of a man and woman talking and laughing suddenly entered my ears. This wasn't anything particularly strange, but I felt that the woman's voice was very familiar. Listening more carefully, it turned out to be Miss S! This aroused my curiosity. Haha, how could they be talking and laughing in this dark place where the moon was obscured by the shadows of the trees? Ah, she's probably talking about love again. I quietly walked behind the tree and stood there, listening to everything they said. "Miss S, rest assured, I will never abandon you. I have ways to smooth things over with my family. If you don't believe me, we can exchange rings right away as a token of engagement." "Yes, I believe you very much. As long as you are determined to love me forever, I can certainly make my stubborn family agree to your request." In the quiet air, the two dark figures seemed to be exchanging tokens. I didn't understand what they were talking about, and I wanted to hear them talk more, but my little brother was already tugging at my clothes, indicating that he wanted to go home. I was afraid of being discovered, so I had to tiptoe away.</p>
<p>The next morning at school, I told my friend Miss W everything I had seen the night before, and asked her to tell me what it meant that Miss S was meeting with a man. She smiled slightly, and her electric gaze glanced at me from the corner of her eye. Then she tapped her finger on my forehead and said mockingly, "Little girl, what are you pretending to be all innocent and naive for? Go ask Miss S about her affairs, I don't know! But since she has this secret love, I must ask her to reveal it." With that, she took my hand and ran to Miss S's dormitory. Miss S, who was working at her desk, looked a little flustered when she saw us running in with smiles on our faces. She hurriedly stuffed a page of scarlet Western-style stationery that she had been writing on her desk into a drawer, but soon returned to her original state, although still with a forced, calm demeanor. Miss W saw her like this and understood her intentions, asking her, "Miss S, why are you writing love letters so secretly?" How could Miss S not defend herself? She then said, "Don't accuse me falsely! I can't find any lovers, maybe you're imagining things yourselves!" Miss W pointed at me and said, "Ask her! Who has a lover? Have you forgotten what happened in V Park last night? Haha, there's a witness here, what are you still denying? Tell the truth!" At this moment, Miss S's face flushed and paled, and her previous strong and unyielding demeanor had vanished without a trace, replaced by a shy and coy attitude, and she stared at us without saying a word. In this silent and tense atmosphere, I couldn't help but be reminded of my old question, and I mustered the courage to ask her, "Miss S, please reveal the process of your love, so that I can also learn the true meaning of love." Faced with such urging and coercion, she seemed to have no strength to resist at all, and could only agree to our request, saying, "Mr. C is a friend I made this spring. He works at L Company. I admire his mastery of writing, and he is also a talented musician. He loves me very much too, so we gradually moved from friendship to considering engagement and..." Her face flushed, and she could no longer continue speaking. But Miss W seemed to forgive her, saying, "Very good! When can we have the pleasure of attending your wedding feast?" She smiled slightly, and her facial expression was extremely smug. She didn't answer our question about when she and Mr. C would be living together, but from her smiling smugness, we could guess that the day of their union wasn't far off.</p>
<p>Miss S and Mr. C are now sweet lovers and will be a happy couple in the future. In the parks with trees and flowers, and in the cinemas showing movies, their footprints are often seen. Therefore, everyone in school knows about and envies this loving couple.</p>
<p>Time passed like flowing water, and four years have gone by in a flash. The romantic story of Mr. C and Miss S no longer exists in our minds, and who still pays attention to their actions? But unintentionally, we feel that Miss S this year is not as lively and happy as in previous years, but has become dull, sad, and depressed. If you look closely at her face, you can probably often find two deep tear streaks. How strange, what sad and unspeakable things has she experienced? I couldn't help but be reminded of my old trick of getting to the root of things, and I wanted to ask her, perhaps I could also relieve some of her pain. On this day, it happened to be Sunday, so I ran to Miss S's house to inquire about her sad affair. She endured the pain and said to me, "Men have no conscience. He used to say to me, 'If this marriage doesn't work out, I would rather not marry. Dear sister, I love you, I will never abandon you.' He used such sweet words to deceive me, a weak woman. Now, he hasn't even sent me a single letter. After inquiring through his friends, I learned that he had already gotten married a few months ago." Before she finished speaking, she was already crying like a river of tears. Seeing her so sad, I couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy. I comforted her for a while and then said goodbye and went home. I thought, what is love? It turns out to be the result of being deceived, resulting in such heartbreak. In the future, I'm afraid I won't dare to approach the word "love" because my best friend has suffered such pain. I heard this and was very sorry, so I recorded it here for everyone to taste what love is like.</p>

<p>(1) A Judge with a Concubine Hearing a Case of Bigamy</p>
<p>What is the difference between a person with a concubine and a person committing bigamy? In theory and in law, there is a judgment, and I don't need to elaborate. However, I think a judge with a concubine will feel uneasy when hearing a bigamy case unless he is protected by the law. Why? Because he is also committing the same offense, which makes it more difficult to handle.</p>
<p>(2) Is it worth it to talk about morality in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Last night, Mr. Fei Fei and I went to Avenue Edward VII. When we passed Dongxin Bridge, we saw a group of bewitching "wild chickens" swarming around a villager. Coincidentally, there was a person dressed in 19th-century clothes in front of us, who said to his companion, "How can such a civilized Shanghai not talk about morality?" I think he was wrong. Cities originally don't have morality, especially Shanghai, which is a den of vice, where the word morality has long disappeared.</p>
<p>(3) Vase</p>
<p>The term "vase" was not widely heard in the first half of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Now, however, this name is all the rage. Newspapers carry it, and writers are also making an unexpected fortune with the term "vase." This term is probably a new invention in the literary world of the 21st year of the Republic of China. It is said that "vase" is a derogatory term for women, which may have some basis. Because women are as beautiful as flowers, calling them vases is not entirely inappropriate.</p>
<p>(4) Ideology Originally Did Not Exist</p>
<p>The purpose of the ×× ideology is to alleviate the suffering of the people, support labor, promote education for the poor, and protect the working class. Mr. S once joined the ×× ideology and was a loyal believer in the ×× ideology. Recently, Mr. S obtained a job at Company B, relying on the capitalist class, which was originally not allowed by the ×× ideology. After Mr. S entered Company B, he specialized in catering to his superiors and being harsh to the workers, completely changing his previous demeanor. What is the reason for this? I think ideology originally did not exist.</p>
<p>(5) Leaving Home and Abandoning Home</p>
<p>People must experience birth, death, separation, and parting. When the moment of parting with parents and loved ones comes, how sad it is, how reluctant one is to leave. However, as soon as one arrives at a certain place and falls in love with a woman, all the sadness and reluctance dissolve. It is not uncommon to not send a letter home for three years, as if one has no home but only remembers her.</p>

<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>(1) How Heartbreaking</p>
<p>On September 18th, Shenyang was forcibly occupied by Japanese pirates, leaving behind a scorched earth. On January 28th, Songhu suffered another tragic robbery by Japanese pirates, again leaving behind a scorched earth. Unexpectedly, just a few months later, the Lu war suddenly broke out, and Yexian was left in a scorched earth. But before one scene closed, another opened, with the Sichuan war, where Luzhou was also left in a scorched earth. Alas! In addition to the scorched earth of foreign troubles of "September 18th" and "January 28th," there is still scorched earth resulting from civil war. How heartbreaking!</p>
<p>"If people don't offend me, I won't offend them" is a common saying among warlords fighting for power and territory. But in the Sichuan-Lu war, who offended whom first? Launching such a major offensive, causing such widespread suffering. Consider: the Japanese pirates' invasion is "people offending me," but we don't "also offend people." Alas? In civil war, "people offend people" and "I also offend people." In foreign troubles, "people offend me" but "I don't offend people," and we don't resist at all. How heartbreaking!</p>
<p>(2) Commonplace</p>
<p>When unscrupulous merchants are warned by patriotic people, they initially restrain themselves a little, but now it has become "commonplace" and not surprising. Therefore, the warnings are given, but the unscrupulous merchants continue to do what they do. Alas! How painful! How hateful!</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai war ended many months ago, there are still many leftover explosives that frequently explode and injure people, as if warning compatriots not to forget the tragic situation of being ravaged by Japanese violence on "January 28th." However, as time passes, the repeated explosions that injure people have become "commonplace." Everyone is numb and indifferent, only blaming the carelessness of those who are hit, but not blaming the source of the poison—the Japanese pirates—for the gift to compatriots. Wake up, fellow countrymen!</p>
<p>(3) I Don't Have... Therefore...</p>
<p>I don't have money, so I am looked down upon and treated with contempt.</p>
<p>I don't have the skill to flatter, so I remain as I am.</p>
<p>I don't have the art of manipulating and winning, so I am even poorer.</p>
<p>I don't have the ability to scheme, so I remain a small businessman.</p>
<p>I don't have the ability to boast, so no one believes me.</p>
<p>I haven't gilded myself at universities and middle schools, so my friends despise me for being uneducated.</p>
<p>I don't have profound knowledge, so I can only resent the corruption of society, but I don't have good ways to save society.</p>

<p>— Qin Jianou</p>
<p>This is a novel in the format of a letter, which is very popular in Europe and the United States right now. Indeed, I also feel that writing a self-narrative novel in this format is relatively more convenient and neat. And on the reader's side, they can, from a natural misidentification, believe that the freedom of the characters in the book evokes a deeper level of sympathy.</p>
<p>××:</p>
<p>Truly, although for the past two years, I have constantly held the hunger and thirst to write you a cheerful, sincere love letter, from the very beginning when this desire arose, I also felt the difficulty of writing this love letter. Indeed, today, on this most courageous day, when I picked up my pen, the first word encountered a strong obstacle. How should I address you? The two words "sister-in-law" seem to be the most suitable, but they are not appropriate for a love letter, nor is it what I want to write. Then, should I call you "Yingmei" or "Manying"? While that is certainly very affectionate, thinking of myself, I feel it is too risky. Perhaps your teasing me is purely unconscious, and there is no possibility of accepting such a passionate form of address from me!</p>
<p>"Unconscious teasing!" I have worried about this too! I have been terrified by this! But every time this illusion occurs, it is immediately broken by the most eloquent facts.</p>
<p>Now, after twenty-four months of trying and being close to you, even if someone uses the most solid evidence to tell me that the water in the Huangpu River is a mutated sweet spring, even if such an unbelievable fact occurs, I can no longer doubt that you have no sincere feelings for me!</p>
<p>"Contradiction! Contradiction!" After reading these three paragraphs of mine, you may laugh loudly and shout.</p>
<p>That's right, the sentences above and below are contradictory. But, my little friend, you must know that human nature is inherently contradictory. Especially when a man, full of suspicion and burning with the "fire of love," is preparing to pour out his heart to the ideal lover he "thinks of day and night," the more he wants to say it clearly and sincerely, the more confused and contradictory he becomes.</p>
<p>Let's use our affair as an example: logically speaking, you are the wife of my friend. "One should not flirt with a friend's wife!" This is a clear instruction from the ancients. I should know this, and I do know this. To be honest, I not only already know this, but judging from my usual words and deeds, I am the strongest opponent of "those who flirt with a friend's wife." I don't even want my friend to say a single word to my wife. But I have very actively seized you and made you my passionate opponent. I have tried every possible way to flirt with my friend's wife. Isn't this contradictory to the extreme?</p>
<p>It is already contradictory, but not only am I unwilling to correct this contradictory thought and eliminate this contradictory behavior, but I am also sincerely praying that this contradictory thought and contradictory behavior will continue. Even if I lose my lifelong reputation because of this, and abandon all that I have, I will never regret it; I am only quietly waiting for the arrival of death.</p>
<p>In fact, my dear little friend, during these two years, I have also been stimulated by morality and tried several times to squeeze out a kind of shameful repentance. Unfortunately, I am just an ordinary little businessman, and how can I have a wisdom sword? Naturally, I can't cut off this tough thread of love. Therefore, the time occupied by each repentance is only like a flash of lightning, lasting less than a few minutes, at most only one or two hours.</p>
<p>I remember March 13th, 19th year of the Republic of China, a spring evening two years ago. The weather was most suitable with a slight warmth. The French parasol trees on both sides of the concession road were competing to grow fresh green leaves. Every passing girl, wearing the new outfit she had just brought back from the department store window, draped it very fittingly over her slender and fleshy body, revealing an extremely excited attitude, very proudly carrying her own captive, in cars, in trams, on the sidewalks, heading in different directions. It was at this time that I, who had graduated from a university in the city and transformed into the principal of a county normal school, after spending seven months of lonely rural life, once again left my loving father, my virtuous but unsophisticated wife, my lively daughter, wearing the latest style of Western suit from 1930, striding towards this "skyscraper-cloud-transforming" Shanghai, coming excitedly.</p>
<p>My motivation for resolutely throwing myself into this scorching furnace for the second time was certainly not for you. Because at that time, I simply hadn't discovered that there was such a suspiciously beautiful woman like you in the world! I came to Shanghai purely to earn a few more dollars!</p>
<p>A monthly salary of two hundred and fifty-seven yuan, outwardly a general manager able to handle things alone. This was enough to make me happy to the point of forgetting my name. What's more, in addition to this superior position, there was another gratifying thing: my old classmate, your legal lover, Zhou Dajing, had also arrived in Shanghai a month earlier from Jinan.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Hollywood's Livestock Agency <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Hollywood has recently discovered a livestock agency. This is a very novel type of business because this agency is fully equipped with all kinds of animals, large like elephants, small like mice, fierce like tigers, poisonous like snakes, and cunning like monkeys. Any kind of livestock needed by film companies can be called for by phone and will arrive in an instant. For example, if you need a polar bear tomorrow at ten o'clock, that can jump into the water from a platform twenty feet high, that can all be done.</p>
<p>The person who founded this agency has been engaged in training animals for the needs of various film studios for seven years. His name is Pat Healey. He is a man of few words and many deeds. In these past seven years, he has never failed to fulfill a request. The things that film companies demand from him are strange and unusual, not only birds and beasts, but also things like insects, but Healey is sure to find a way to gather them and not fail the trust.</p>
<p>Many people who demand things from Healey can be said to have no common sense. They often want a small lion, or a caterpillar, or a swallow, and don't think about whether these things are in season. Therefore, Healey's only job is to find ways to search in all directions for things that are not in season, no matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter. His representatives are all over the world, and the transportation methods used, such as ships, airplanes, trains, mail, etc., all strive for speed to please his customers. But Healey is not bothered by this, but thinks that the joy of the business is this point of "being able to do what others cannot."</p>
<p>But in fact, the things that Hollywood film studios usually need do not require much effort to find overseas. It is said that Hollywood is a very strange place. Hollywood can find almost everything in the world because there are many men and women around Hollywood who specialize in raising livestock for a living. All kinds of rare birds and exotic animals can be temporarily rented from the various farms. Each of them has their own specialties. Crocodiles, bears, monkeys, lions, ostriches, snakes, foxes, yellow birds, pigeons, owls, eagles, etc., can be rented from various families. There are also many monsters from the Classic of Mountains and Seas that can be borrowed from the agency.</p>
<p>Healey said: The current moviegoers are no longer the same as before. In the past, if something was missing, it could be replaced with something similar, but that is not possible now. Therefore, the work of the agency is especially heavy. The table listed below shows the daily rental prices for various common beasts:</p>
<p>Elephant: $100 Sea Dog: $35</p>
<p>Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Bear, etc.: $25</p>
<p>Monkey: $20 Snake: $15</p>
<p>House Cat: $0.75 Rabbit: $0.25</p>
<p>But these prices cannot be generalized. It also depends on their skills. For example, a dog costs $1.50 per day to rent, but if it is alert and can act, it costs $150 per day. Of course, Rin Tin Tin is not included in this example.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Talking About Yuan Meiyun <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Ying</p>
<p>Those who have seen "Little Actress" have probably already understood the skills of the fifteen-year-old child star Yuan Meiyun. All her expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are revealed in her innocent expressions. It is heard that Yuan Meiyun previously performed on the Tianchan stage. Shao Zuiweng, the owner of Tianyi, appreciated her talent and specially wrote a script for her, inviting her to play the lead role. Yuan Meiyun did not disgrace her mission and was able to reveal her genius from the start. In "Little Actress," there are several scenes that can make people cry, such as the scene where she jumps up when she sees a figure outside the window at night, and the scene where she meets her mother upon returning home. How deeply they strike the hearts of the audience!</p>
<p>From now on, there will be one more Yuan Meiyun among the successful Chinese female stars!</p>

<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Young sister Li Minghui has been in Shanghai for several months since coming from Hong Kong. Due to Shao Zuiweng's vigorous persuasion and her father Jinhui's introduction, she formally joined Tianyi. But since joining, several weeks have passed, and the Tianyi authorities have still not written a script for Minghui to star in. Meanwhile, others such as Chen Yumei, Lu Lixia, and Yuan Meiyun have finished one play and are already continuing to shoot another. Minghui is accustomed to moving and not accustomed to being still. Recently, she has been doing nothing in her spare time. Her heart is truly depressed beyond description.</p>

<p>Jeanette MacDonald recently declared that she would no longer co-star in films with Maurice Chevalier. Because she heard rumors that her success was due to Chevalier's help. Therefore, she has decided to no longer rely on others and to stand on her own. She has already arranged for herself to perform a short stage opera. In the near future, she may begin performing on Broadway.</p>

<h3 id="e235">The Valuation of Love <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Most young people in love probably hope to know the valuation of love, right? In the new film "The Valuation of Love" by Guo Qin Ying, there is also no accurate answer given; it is still only vaguely said that love can be bought with no money. This is very much in line with the original drama title "Bought." But they are probably all thinking that love is just bought, so in the end, it still points out the disillusionment of buying love and the perfect union of pure love.</p>
<p>It mocks women's love of money and men's emphasis on social status, just like other love films, slandering vain love!</p>
<p>The plot is roughly about: an illegitimate daughter, living a self-reliant life, gets along well with a poor intellectual, but receives considerable help in material terms from an old gentleman. Soon, she meets a wealthy young man and leaves her old lover behind. When this young man learns that she is an illegitimate daughter, the engagement that the two sides had made is broken off. When she returns to the old gentleman's house, her old lover is already waiting for her. Only then does she understand that this wealthy gentleman is her biological father. In her reconciliation with her old lover and their mutual embrace, this play ends!</p>
<p>Constance Bennett, playing this naive and innocent girl just discovering love, is better than her previous performances. The two drunken scenes are wonderfully done. Originally a completely inexperienced woman, stepping onto the path of society, her various expressions—joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—are not due to the heart. Constance plays this role, empathizing and being natural. Richard Bennett, playing the gentleman, is mature and dignified, inspiring awe. The real-life father and daughter, playing the fake father and daughter in the play, their dialogues and expressions are seamlessly connected, vividly portraying a pair of loving father and weak daughter. Perhaps this is due to nature. Ben Lyon, playing the writer, although not entirely suitable, still has admirable aspects, at least being able to talk about inner performance. Raymond Milland is indeed a handsome and healthy young man, revealing the personality of a playboy and spoiled young master. With his beauty, Hollywood can probably count on him. Perhaps the director is using his beauty as an object for women's vanity. The neatness of the supporting roles is something Warner Bros. has never done before.</p>
<p>The cooperation between the director and cinematographer has excellent results. The light is sometimes too bright (such as in the moonlit scenes, it would be more romantic if it were a little darker), but overall it is still good.</p>
<p>The small interludes and hidden writings are extremely beautiful, such as the shadow left behind when people leave, the smoke released by the pipe; the three birthday gifts, etc., all have the power to evoke memories. The comparison before and after is also very touching, invisibly expressing a kind of spiritual contradiction and material change.</p>
<p>However, the middle section could be shorter; and at the end, the woman's photo in the gentleman's study should be a close-up to attract the audience's attention, because the center of the comedy ultimately comes down to this photo!</p>
<p>A Discussion of Domestic Films</p>
<h3 id="e236">Another "Little Actress" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Su</p>
<p>No matter what kind of drama, film or stage play, its only creed is "playing a role without getting too into the role". "Little Actress" suffers from the problem of getting too into the role. The opening scene showing Wang's shrewishness seems to deviate from reason. Why describe the father-in-law and husband as so weak? If not hitting the father-in-law and not hitting the husband, is there no suitable and reasonable material in this life?</p>
<p>Little Lin's family is not that poor. We can see this from the set design. Otherwise, how could Wang have won the favor of Chen Naixin, who acts like he is tearing down walls? But Little Lin's grandfather, after falling on hard times, seems to have completely revealed the ugly side of a country bumpkin. How could he be so unaware of the world? Because the description is excessive, such a contradiction arises.</p>
<p>Little Lin is just a little actress who has just stepped onto the stage. How could she suddenly become so popular? And after that, Little Lin's teacher's wife disappears without a trace. This alone is enough to show that the screenwriter lacks too much understanding of life.</p>
<p>When Ji Zhong is sick with anger, Wang answers her lover's phone. Because Ji Zhong groans, she cannot hear the phone clearly and gets angry and scolds him. And this scene of Ji Zhong being thirsty in his illness is exactly the same as the treatment Wang receives from Chen Naixin when she is sick, without the slightest difference. It is clumsy and too stupid. Everyone can decide that in this world, there is no such identical parallel life.</p>
<p>The letter that Little Lin writes home has "Zhangjiabang, to be received by Mother" written on the envelope. The postman somehow knows the original address of the letter writer's mother and actually sends it to find her. When has there ever been such a clever postman? But the postman's cleverness is also the director's clumsiness.</p>
<p>The leading actress, Yuan Meiyun, is able to act and her performance is not bad. She is a promising talent, and this should not be buried.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Practicing "Smiling Broadly" <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Let's put aside all kinds of infinitely changing smiles for now and first practice this most common and straightforward smile.</p>
<p>This is the sixth form of the Expression Self-Study Method. The method of practice is slightly different from the previous five forms. First, pay attention to the space between your eyebrows in the mirror. (Don't forget, your eyes must be more than a foot away from the mirror.) Then, while slowly counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" silently, slowly inhale a breath from your nose. At the same time, your mouth slowly opens into a smile, and your eyes slowly narrow, practicing the meaning of the four words "smiling broadly." By the time you finish counting eight words, you have just turned into a smiling face like Maitreya Buddha.</p>
<p>As before, while holding onto this breath and this smile, slowly count "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" silently (of course, without making a sound). At this time, you must pay close attention and keep this smile without the slightest change, as if you are facing a camera to leave a smiling photo. I know that many people cannot easily do this. Because they have never looked at themselves in the mirror with such a dignified appearance, and they will burst out laughing when they see it. This laugh is not a big deal, but it completely blows out the breath you were holding. Remember! When holding this smile, you must keep it without the slightest change.</p>
<p>Then gradually increase the degree of the smile. While silently counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" and exhaling this breath, your eyes narrow more and more, and your mouth opens more and more, smiling until the "eight" and you have smiled out all the air in your lungs, to the point where you cannot breathe.</p>
