<p>一目標（甲）適應需要丨丨兒童食量小所以進食時間的距離須短自早餐至午刻有五時之久中間一定需要少許餅餌之類充飢（乙）練習飲食時應有的禮節（丙）養成飲食應有的清潔習慣（丁）養成愛惜食物的習慣</p>
<p>二内容每日上午十時左右每兒食適當的食品（山芋餅乾之類）和飲開水一杯（經費寛裕者可用牛奶代水或吃水果少許）</p>
<p>第三敎育方法要點</p>
<p>㈠以上所列各種活動（音樂·游戲·故事和兒歌·社會自然·工作等）於實際施行時應該打成一片無所謂科目打成一片的方法應該以一種需要的材料（應時的如三月的植樹節十月的國慶秋天的紅葉冬天的白雪等在環境内發現的如替玩偶做生日公葬某種已死的益鳥開母姊會等等）做一日或兩三日内作業的中心一切活動都不離乎這個中心的範圍</p>
<p>㈡幼稚兒童每天在園的時間全日約六小時在都市有特殊情形的幼稚園可用半日制每日上午約三小時中間除定時餐點靜息和全日制的中午停止作業進午餐和定時靜臥外各種活動不可呆板的分節規定（如每時應敎何種功課）但是敎師應該胸有成竹在繁重作業之後引導兒童作輕便的活動在桌間作業之後引導兒童作户外的運動······並可相機在某種活動之後間以幾分鐘的休息以調節兒童的身心</p>
<p>㈢各種作業可由兒童各從所好自由活動但是團體作業每日也應有一次由敎師用暗示法吸引兒堂共同操作當團體作業如有少數兒童不願參加不必强迫㈣故事游戲音樂社會和自然大部分都可由敎師引導施行團體作業工作則大部分應該由兒童個别活動由敎師個别指導丨丨此等活動可將全部作業分爲若干項目（例如圖畫剪貼積木······）由兒童分組合作分工活動但須注意二事一分組以兩三人爲一組合作一事爲最有效二分工兒童往往未做完這事又去做那事或半途而廢或苟且塞責敎師應訓練他們使他們有責任心訓練的方法或用表記演能做完成的與以獎的符號否則與以戒的符號或對做完成的表示好感對未做完成的表示冷淡</p>
<p>㈤敎師應該充分的預備以免臨時困難預備的事項應該隨兒童活動的趨向而定例如在國慶紀念的活動之前敎師對於兒童在國慶紀念的活動中預料應有若干問題和事實發生就應向這一方面搜集材料準備技能······以便應付</p>
<p>㈥敎師所提出以引導兒童活動的材料和指導兒童活動的方法以及一切進行都須體察兒童心理切合兒童的經騐</p>
<p>㈦幼稚敎育所用的材料不是空話而是日常可見可接觸至少可想象的實物事實幼稚敎育所用的場所不限於室内而須以户外的算然界·家庭·村·市·工商業······爲最好的活動的地方</p>
<p>㈧幼稚園的設計敎學須注意左列各點一從兒童自由活動中發現設計的題材例如一個兒童在沙箱栽種白菜敎師發現後便可集合許多兒童設計種菜這是設計敎學中一個很好的機會應該利用二在設計中應有的一切活動應該早就體察兒童的能力把兒童不能做或做不世功的部分省去以免兒童因不能做而廢止或因中途失敗而懊喪三設計的材料以易達目的易得結果的爲最好在一個設計中又須分爲許多小段落每一小段落有一小目的可得一小結果那麽兒童照着做去得達目的得有結果也自然發生興趣而自肯努力了萬一整個的設計做到中途而多數兒童的興趣已轉移了那麽敎師也可把這個設計放下便從事於多數兒童興趣所在的設計等相當的時機到來再行設法繼續</p>
<p>㈨敎師是兒童活動中的把舵者要使兒童跟著他的趨向而進行在未達目的前不要改變宗旨所發的暗示也當一貫而不雜亂在兒童旣反應而未到完成時不可再有叧一種的新暗示</p>
<p>㈩敎師是最後裁判者兒童的問題應由兒童自已解决到兒童的確不能解决時敎師才可從旁啟發引導</p>
<p>㈩㈠敎師應利用獎勵以鼓勵兒童對於某種作業的興趣幼兒的獎勵以言語和玩具的贈與爲最有効標幟符號的獎勵次之獎勵所應注意的一獎勵不可常用常用則濫而失効二在羣衆中優勝固然當獎個人前後比較而突然有進步的也應該獎勵</p>
<p>㈩㈡有幾種技能應該用「練習」的方使兒童純熟練習必須顧到的條件如左一時　應該短以保持兒童對於練習的興趣和注意二次數分配應該合於分佈練習的原則（開始時每天在一定的短時間内速練習練習熟後乃間歇練習純熟後才停止）三練習所用的材料須估其有無眞正價値不必練習的不可枉費工夫四練習的方法須查考其是否最優良誤用了方法例如不用實物而練習抽象符號）也一定勞而無功五練習時不但要注意兒童所表顯的成績並且要注意兒童所用的方法是否合宜不合宜一定要隨時矯正</p>
<p>㈩㈣每半年舉行「體格檢查」一次每月舉行「體高體重檢查」一次每日舉行「健康并清潔檢查」一次（法詳小學衛生等科課程標凖）兒童身體上的缺陷和各種疾病敎師應該設法補救敎師不但應有母親和師長的智能並須具有看護的身手治病的常識</p>
<p>㈩㈤敎師對於兒童的身體·性情·好尙·以及家庭·環境·都應注意最好備一本小册子將觀察所得的紀錄起來以爲研究和施敎的資料</p>
<p>㈩㈥敎師應該常常到兒童家庭去或請家長到園中來盡力聯絡感情宣傳幼稚敎育和家庭敎育的方法</p>
<p>㈩㈦幼稚園除利用户外的自然和社會外依左列標準設備一切一要合乎我國的民族性我國的民族性是誠樸·堅忍和歐美日本不同的幼稚園的設備不必過於華美而須注意於堅固不必多取洋式和舶來品而須盡量中國化二要合乎當地社會情形我國地方遼闊都市·鄉村·南方·北土·富饒地　瘠區······社會情形各各不同幼稚園的設備應該多取當地常見的物品而不和社會的實際情形分離三要適應兒童的需要要體察兒童的生理狀况·心理狀態·生活情形隨其需要而設備（甲）量不宜太簡陋期夠用（乙）質應便於兒童以求適用四要不背敎育的意義積極方面要（甲）可以發展兒童創造力和激引兒童想像方的（乙）可由兒童自己使用并自己裝置或拆開的丙可以引起兒童的興趣和美感的丁可以引起兒童的情感的（戊）可以發展兒童的智力的（己）有益於兒童身體的消極方面要（甲）有碍衛生的不取（乙）容易發生危險的不取（丙）兒童不感興趣的不取（戊）有損美觀的不取五要利用廢物天然物和日用品廢物如舊書·舊報·破布·無用的玻璃片玻璃瓶·布片·破盌片天然物如果核·樹葉·花瓣·種子·蛤壳·貝壳·鳥羽·石子······日用品如肥皂·洋燭······都可利用了做成敎育用品·裝飾品和作業材料等這不但省錢并可啟發兒童的創造力</p>

<p>— 碧</p>
<p>│全賴不知足│</p>
<p>學校裏出來，吃飯地盤，還没着落，要三個銅板零用，須挖老子娘的腰包。那時候的打算，祇要找到一位老闆，月支十塊錢薪水，就心滿意足了。等了一年半載，靠列祖列宗在天之靈，居然打着燈籠，找到了每月三十元的生意，這是多麽可喜的一回事。但是到了月底，眼見人家花花綠綠的鈔票，一疊一疊的裝進口袋裏，自己辛苦了一月，却祗薄薄的三張。這口氣咽不下，於是不得不東托親，西托友，另謀高就。吃飯問題解决後，第一當前大問題，是要打算如何稱心合意的妻子，有了這念頭，便覺得人家捉對兒厮守着，公餘回寓，二小口兒說說笑笑，星期假日，做幾色菜吃吃，多麽有趣。没有妻子的，公餘回寓，影隻形單，到了吃飯時候，還要上飯館，星期假日，更是無聊。於是乎饑不擇食，也來娶一房妻子試試看。但是娶了一年，不識趣的小孩，呱呱的出世。那時，妻子的愛，給小孩奪去了一半。公餘回寓，茶杯到了椅上，尿布丢了一地，一切都感到不愉快。於是不得不在外再轉念頭，别求精神上的慰藉。</p>
<p>飯盌旣有着落，性煩惱也解决了，於是又要眼紅人家坐汽車，住洋房了。同是一個人，爲甚人家住洋房，我住亭子樓；人家坐汽車，我每天拐着腿在路上走？這樣吧，花十塊錢，買一張香檳，再靠一下列祖列宗在天之靈，着上一二十萬大洋錢，一切衣食住行，都解决了。但是一二十萬大洋錢果然到了手，是否不再甚麽奢望，那我不能保險。</p>
<p>據說，社會就是這樣演進的。</p>
<h3 id="c177">巧計脫匪窟之鮑萊夫人 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 葉心佛</p>
<p>│深知華人之思想及弱點│</p>
<p>英國鮑萊夫人Mrs·MurielPawley淪陷牛莊匪窟，爲近年最轟動一時之綁案，上月間談判接近，得以釋歸。昨遇西友「胡得」君，談及鮑案，謂此次鮑萊等（按尙有Mr·CharlesCorran）之脫險，要非巧使智計，恐遭毒手。當覊留匪窟時，雖飲食不潔，堪稱優待，然百般威嚇，時作殘毁軀體之狀怖之，匪首興之所至，竟被割去一耳，切爲肉糜。鮑萊夫人非僅操華語甚爲流利，且深知華人之思想，及觀念之弱點，憑此思路而進索之，焦心苦慮，日以繼夜，卒被思得一法。鼓其勇氣，進告匪首曰：『如余等竟被殺害，余等鬼魅必日夜侵擾，使爾等永無寗日。更有甚焉，余等將爾等祖宗以及子子孫孫，盡變爲龜類，』言時悲鳴哀泣，悽惋欲絶，且佯作投擊自盡之狀，弱女之嬌啼，竟勝一國之武力，匪等睹狀，竟爲所動，竊竊私議，大降贖價，未及數日，談判即定，往贖釋歸，毫無留難云。</p>
<h3 id="c178">爲甚怕老婆 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 顏春繁</p>
<p>│三個階段的起因│</p>
<p>怕老婆不是中國佔獨有的人材，恐怕歐美也不少罷。爲甚麽要怕老婆呢？却有三個起因的階段，如今把它記在下面：</p>
<p>愛；夫婦總是恩愛的好，丈夫爲着維持夫婦倆的愛情，處處都順從他的妻子，只要能博伊歡心，免得由吵鬧而發生許多不便。</p>
<p>敬；伊看丈夫能處處體貼自己的意思，更撒嬌得了不得！男人免得愛情發生裂㾗，委曲求全，到這地步，已進了「敬」的一個階段了。</p>
<p>畏；進了第三個階段，那怕你有殺賊千里血滬成渠的本領，因爲剛不能尅柔的緣故，所以你制服伊不得了。譬如一把鋼刀，斬那很柔的絲綿，任你用多大的氣力，也是斬不斷的。唐六如說：『天道夢夢何必怕，地道冥冥何必懼，所可怕者，日日監臨於坐側之人也！』閱者或問可有不怕的法子呢？我說有是有的，却要賣三分關子哩。</p>
<h3 id="c179">目中無人 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 沈枕月</p>
<p>│爲了階級不平等│</p>
<p>瞎子因爲瞧不見人，所以他目中無人；</p>
<p>亮眼目中無人，這是很驚奇的，也很痛心的？</p>
<p>城裏的人到了鄕下，他就目中無人，穿長衫的人，在着短衣人的家裏，他也就目中無人；</p>
<p>有錢的人，到了無錢的窮人家裏，他也就目中無人；</p>
<p>有錢的人可以自由侮辱窮人，窮人不敢去反抗，窮人有時把富人的不是，批評批評，富人就要威勢十足的起來反抗，這也是目中無人的一幕，大槪爲了階級不平，纔有這一類目中無人，俗語所謂『像煞有介事，』這是送給一班目中無人者的獎詞？</p>
<p>社會上這樣的目中無人，那裏還談得到公理？那裏還談得到平等？</p>
<p>所以這類目中無人的人，就是破壞公理，破壞平等的罪人？</p>
<p>愛護平等的人，不會破壞公理，破壞平等的人，一定先破壞公理，要保護公理，要保護平等，應該打倒違反公理的目中無人者！</p>
<p>然而着長衫的和着短衣的同是一個人，有錢的和没錢的也同是一個人，就不應該看輕窮人，我很希望目中無人的思想一下子。</p>

<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>慕良說：「我倒並不覺得怎樣不舒服，到底上海地方大，散得開，家裏住得厭氣了，到外面去散散，就得啦，老是悶在鴿子籠裏，本來不是一回事。」韓大少奶有些不耐了，先從鼻管裏哼出一個「哼」字來，接着說：「不比你們男人，一出門，像鳥離了籠子一般，再也不想還來了。我們女人，除非看戲，上館子，逛游戲場，孤單零零，有什麽興味。」慕良滿臉堆上笑來說：「不要牢騷，明天我伴你到各處去走走。」韓大少奶還是有氣無力的說：「你有工夫？我不信。」慕良懶洋洋地說：「這幾天玩得苦極了，我們住慣蘇州的，不能磨夜，到了大天白亮的時候，那裏還睡得着，再玩下去，快要生病了。」</p>
<p>韓大少奶故意取笑他說：「有女人伴着，還會倦麽？」</p>
<p>慕良說：</p>
<p>「你可知道我們玩的什麽頑意兒？」</p>
<p>「誰知道！」韓大少奶面上一些笑意都没有，淡淡地說：「不過是一百八十一，小花園，或者八仙橋」。</p>
<p>「不！不！」我們去跳舞，跳無比賭錢，比嫖，都有趣，可惜時候太晏，太吃力。』「買了一個來，在家裏跳舞，就舒服了，自由了。」韓大少奶說完了，撲嗤的一笑，誰知這句話，正打中了慕良的下懷。不久把一個姨太太攆跑了，現在又想弄一個來，未免要受伊嘲笑，雖然料定伊没有能力阻制他，不過越是柔順，越不好意思瞞伊，况且在國難時期，在避難時期，更不好意思談起這一回事。難得伊先說出來，便有機會了，因此狠興奮地，笑意充滿了兩顆狠野心的眼珠，灼灼地對着韓大少奶說：</p>
<p>「上海女人難弄，你倒以爲像討愛姑時一般的容易？」</p>
<p>「天下無難事，只要有心人。」</p>
<p>「霓裳舞塲裏有一個舞女，眞好，圓圓的臉子，又豐潤，又嫩，像一隻纔熟的玉露水蜜桃，嬝嬝婷婷的身段，比水蛇還靈活，人家說，摩豋女人的屁股是「四不靈，」我說，伊全身都是「四不靈，」連話話，一推一就，也有彈性的；人說，女人的兩顆眼珠是有電的，我說，伊三萬六千個毛孔，孔孔有電。······」</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>天天做談言，而苦無題目，眞是討厭，因爲有的題目不敢做，有的題目不能做，有的題目不必做，今天早晨起來，又將報紙翻開看看，報上所載，有國聯開會前夕，黑省大戰爆發，想着當此氷天雪窖之中，幾位忠勇愛國的義勇軍，在東省與强暴抵抗，恨不得挿翅飛去，帮同他們前去殺敵，又看見宋代院電蘇炳文將軍，勿害日俘，宋院長的仁心仁聞，也是難得，遂將報紙放在一邊不看，</p>
<p>無聊得很，遂在書架上抽了一本書，開卷一看，乃是一本左傳，隨便翻翻，讀到宋襄公與楚人戰於弘一段文字，襄公曰「古者，不重傷，不擒二毛，古之爲軍也，不以阻狹也，寡人雖亡國之餘，不鼓不成列，」我笑宋襄公眞是好行其德，宜其稱覇一時，又將左傳抛在一邊，復在書架抽着一本Bible聖經，忽見中有「人批我左頰，我以右頰承之，」我深歎耶穌敎義之宏，但我並不是一個耶敎徒，看他則甚，又束置不看，仍是無聊，乃從架上抽着一本資治通鑑，又看到一段文字，「唐婁師得弟守代州，辭之官，師德敎之耐事，其弟曰，自今人有唾我面，我拭之而已，師德曰，人唾汝面，怒汝也，拭之，是逆其意，止使自乾耳，」我看到此處，不覺歎古人度量之宏，與耶敎同一精義，如合一轍，頗爲難得，</p>
<p>我看了以上兩段書，頗爲得意，乃又翻下去。看到「楊再思爲相，司禮少卿張同休，是易之之兄，嘗因晏集戲再思曰，楊内史，面似高麗，再思欣然，剪紙帖巾，反披紫袍，爲高麗舞，我暗笑古人眞有如此無恥之徒，大爲失望，就把通鑑放還架上，</p>
<p>我想正經正史不要看了，還是看看小說，偶然翻看了一部西廂記，頗爲得意，我想看西廂記必定要吃了麥粥去看的，又想到西廂記金聖歎的批頭最好，不如且看看他的批頭，恰巧翻着拷艶一段，有「街行見兩措大執爭一理，旣皆目裂頸赤，如不戴天，而又高拱手低曲腰，滿口仍用之乎者也等字，其語刺刺，勢將連年不休，忽有壯夫，掉臂行來，振威從中一喝而解，不亦快哉，」正在看到爽快之處，忽想起今天要做談言，尙没有題目，乃亂七八糟，把方才看見過的書，寫在這裏，也算是一篇談言了，</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>昨蒙友人邀讌，席間得晤舊雨某丈，談及内亂不已，渠出示其所撰七律四首，題曰「故鄕事棘書此寫憂」捧誦一過，覺一字一淚，不勝悲慘，詢其能否公諸報端，以代呼籲，渠謂爲故鄕災民設想，固所深願，但旅滬以後，曾因文字而賈禍，故不敢再以寫憂之作，開罪於人，予曰然則不將大名發表若何，渠始允許，爰特遵命將其原著照錄如下，希閱者諒之，</p>
<p>故國河山一局棋，傳來消息極酸悲，杯弓蛇影頻驚夢，市虎人言最啓疑，羣盜正當焚掠日，幾生修到太平時，長沙痛哭夫何補，心緒紛繁紊亂絲，</p>
<p>聞道烽烟熾野亭，忍看人醉獨爲醒，亂離狀况如天寳，保護人民仗地靈，殺氣陡橫近郊白，燒痕怕見遠山青，安全之策空搔首，拚却浮生醉綠</p>
<p>豫陜軍書太緊張，元戎小隊出郊忙，畀秦天不惜鶉首，欺雪我難堅木腸，悍賊紛紜起荆棘，雄師供給竭壺槳，征夫辛苦問前路，萬變風雲嗟杳茫，</p>
<p>佳客　筵論匪氛，故山四面塞黃雲，鄕人屬望空歸我，救刦無方愧對君，殘菊傲霜清澈骨，征鴻唳月悔離羣，大荒披髮帝閽呌，胡不使余爲統軍，</p>

<h3 id="c223">關於煤氣中毒及急救法 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>在嚴寒的冬季裏圍爐取暖或置一只火爐於寤室裏，那是多麽快樂的事，但也因該留意，不然不但可以燒焦衣服，還能致人死命，這不是說謊，不信，只要把去年或前冬天的報紙，拿來一看，就能證明我說的是實話，</p>
<p>煤氣究竟怎樣能致人死命呢，這是很値得研究的問題，原來薪料或煤炭，在火爐中因爲受了高溫度的帮助，就發生一種化學作用，與空氣的氧氣化合，成爲一種無色無味無臭的二氣化碳氣，當其化合時，自身也放出很大量的熱，所以其餘的碳，也因熱而與氧氣化合，這樣的循環不已，直到所有的碳，完全氧化爲止，燃料中的雜質，就殘留成爲灰燼，</p>
<p>炭氣化時，（即燃燒）時需要多量的氧氣，及放出更多量二氧化碳，假使通風裝置很完備，那就不成問題，新鮮空氣儘量可從外面進來，驅出無用的二氧</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>化碳，但是有時因爲要防止熱的擴散，緊閉所有的窗户，這樣室内所有的氧氣，因爲氧化而漸漸減少，無用的二氧化碳却漸漸的加多，誰都知道，生物是離不了氧氣的，雖然二氧化碳决不含一絲毒質，也能使室内的人漸漸覺得頭暈目眩，這時還不把窗户打開，使新鮮空氣進來，（假使室内的人已熟睡）那麽所有的生物將要窒息而死，</p>
<p>但是還有一個最大的原因，就是火爐下的碳氧化成二氧化碳上昇，經過上部燒熱的碳，因爲氧氣缺乏，還原成爲一氧化碳，火爐上發出藍色的熖，就是這個作用所致，這一氧化碳，雖也與二氧化碳，同爲一種無色無味無臭的氣體，但却不像二氧化碳的溫柔，他具有猛烈的毒性，空氣中含一氧化碳八百分之一，三十分鐘内能將室内的人殺死，因爲把他吸入肺中能和赤血球化合，</p>
<p>而成一種櫻紅色的東西，這東西不能將養氣分佈體内，以至一切生機，完全停止而至於死，你想這是多麽可怕的事，中煤毒死的人，假使全身已現紫色，那就是血液已經凝結，全身的血管全被淤塞的證據，這樣已無可救藥了，若只現青色或微有紫色，應該立即把他放在空氣流通的地方，用濕冷布摩擦其全身，以通瘀血，并用桃仁一兩，枳實五錢，萊服子五錢煎湯，另用生大黃一兩瀘汁，加入，撬開牙關徐徐灌之，約半日而蘇，中毒輕的只要搗多量蘿葡汁，或生梨，藕汁，在空氣流通處，灌之，中毒未滿二十分鐘内時皆可蘇醒，平常燃煤爐的常吃蘿葡，也能疎解平時所受的煤毒，柿餅不單能解煤毒，也能防來春的喉疾，所以也應該常常吃他，</p>

<p>— 戀戀</p>
<p>時間是一個例假日的前夜，正是寒風撲打疎簾的當兒；×校××樓十三號宿舍裏，有八個青年在熄了燈後的洋燭之光下打撲克，走廊之中，也有二個青年不聲不語地吸着捲烟蹀𨇾往來，有時向樓梯下諦聽；有時向玻窗外呆望，明顯地，他倆像被僱着報警的巡視者實行他們的工作了</p>
<p>×校並不怎樣嚴緊，宿舍裏的事尤其爲學校當局忽視，他們要賭，其實也不是什麽不了的事，不過爲防萬一起見，終不免鰓鰓過慮地防留一下，雖則事實上，這晚舍監不知何處去了，尤足心安膽豪放浪地賭。</p>
<p>因爲明天是放假，這晚回府去的人特别多，十三號裏的洋鈿聲喧笑聲，雖然不怎樣鬧，可也因人靜而響得透，一個大聲大氣的同學，更其顯得響，什麽三條老K，愛司阿QTwoPairs二塊找三塊······興高彩烈，捲烟抽得連隔房也烟霧迷漫起來，整個的環境是迷醉，躭溺，腐化，無意識。</p>
<p>事確乎出人意外，在這樣的深夜，舍監×先生却醉薰薰地回來了，望風朋友在理是可以看見他的，可是因爲時間已十一點鐘多，料想×先生不致返校，所以也加入戰團，躭躭逐逐地賭了，×先生上樓，他們那裏會知道呢？於是緊張的一幕，接着就開始。</p>
<p>×先生旣醉旣倦，本無心於捉賭，不過當他上床之後，爲洋鈿聲鬧得睡不穩之故，氣惱得不得不起身一捉·然而年青的同學，耳朶畢竟靈敏，×先生脚步聲一近，他們中的一個開門出外看了，一看之後，就知道舍監來捉賭，於是碰的一聲，把房門關得悶緊，洋燭是熄了，洋鈿聲喧笑聲靜了，十個人齊上床一聲不響地裝假睡·等到×先生開房門進來查看時，除了烟霧迷緊不散，中人欲嗆之外，什麽也看不見·他奇極了，撩開帳門一個個查看，却又像睡猪般穩，這舉動，他明知他們弄的玄虚，不過他們旣已不賭，也落得回房安睡，還招什麽怨？但這般小傢伙豈是好惹的，以爲這一下有意和他們過不去，非一作弄×先生，無以戒其後來，綽號潘金蓮的小金，於是想了一個妙計，有分敎「小子略施手腕，先生跌進門來。」</p>
<p>在×先生回房之後不到十分鐘，十三號宿舍裏忽地一聲火起，接着面盆上鏜鏜二聲，×先生心慌意亂，趕忙出來觀看，外面却空空如也，何嘗有火？不過，十三號裏旣一再瞎鬧·要弄得終夜睡不着終不興的·所以再進十三號，想勸他們不要胡鬧·不料進門口後，脚下一不留神，被一根橫架着的竹竿絆了一交，直跌得他發昏　第十二，然而奇極，床上十個學生，機械地一個個起床攙他起來，向他拍去　　，還殷勤地對他說：「早知先生要來查房間，我們也不以防備小愉的手段旋展設置了，×先生，我們眞對不起</p>
<p>×先生搖搖頭，嘆了口氣蹣跚回房，嘴裏自言自語道：冷板凳的苦處，不知何時受盡呢│十三號房間裏却吃吃地傳出一陣笑聲，夾着一句話是「金郎妙計安天下，可使先生跌進來，」</p>

<h3 id="c225">爲了「花瓶」 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>在今日，我們應當卸去傳統的着了色的，宗法，封建的眼鏡，我們應當承認男女在任何地位是絶對平等的丨尤其是職業，男子能夠做的事，也應當予以機會而十分信任地讓女子去做。這，在今日，還有誰能來否認？</p>
<p>近年來，女子職業在中國，總算萌了一點點幼芽。在學校裏，醫院裏，她們已給了我們以相當的成績。漸漸地，在寫字間裏亦有了她們的踪影兒，但不幸得很，她們一個個都很快的只取得了一個玩意性質的「花瓶」的美名兒！······我爲此很懷疑社會上的人，爲甚麽如此無聊，吃飽了自己的飯没事幹？這不是侮辱女子人格，狠心要這一點點女子職業的幼苗麽？</p>
<p>朋友告訴我，「寫字間裏的女職員，根本就不會做事，老闆用她，無非是點綴和調劑寫字間裏的沉重，枯寂，單調的空氣，給男職員們以興奮而增進工作的效率。穿得紅紅綠綠擺着裝樣兒，這還不是花瓶麽？女子自己不爭氣，怪得誰在侮辱她？」</p>
<p>爲了「花瓶」兩個字，我着實憤忿了好些時日，我時常狠命地咒駡那些無聊的侮蔑人的下流東西！</p>
<p>不久，我們公司辦公室的間壁××部，也來了一位年青的女職員，大家都喊她徐小姐。她的同學們都說她是位「時代姑娘」······美麗，摩登的交際之花，許多青年在追逐她呢！至於她的職務，因爲我們隔着一垜壁，我始終没有弄清楚，也有人說她字都寫不清楚，用來接待電話，無非也是一點花瓶而已。</p>
<p>我們這間狹小而充滿了窮酸氣味的編輯室裏，向來是寒冷又枯燥，同事們都架了銅邊老光眼鏡整日搖頭擺腦，嘴巴裏不停地哼着，咏着，自從間壁的時代姑娘來了以後，暖和的笑的空氣，便穿過板壁而侵入了我們的編輯室裏，起初，還覺得是新的，鮮的，很有些莫明其妙的趣味；可是漸漸的，就起了極大的煩惱和不安！電話的鈴，成天隔不到一分鐘的亂響，清脆，嬌柔，像唱歌般的調子，一唱至少要半點鐘。我們的聽神經極本能地句句把它吸收起來，文思便糟亂了，於是，頭擺昏了，腿踱腫了，一個字寫不出來，老闆限期要稿子，急得搔頭挖耳，哼着「腦昏眼花口難言！」於是，我們便開始咒詛花瓶了······花瓶，你不爭氣的甘心下流的東西！</p>
<p>朋友問我道：「這是誰在侮辱女性呢？你該認識「花瓶」了吧？人家不致於吃飽自己的飯而專事無聊呵丨你一心爲女子說話，然而女子自己不爭氣，那還有甚麽說頭？······」</p>

<p>— 房竇</p>
<p>大槪在一星期前吧。某天晚上，同陳君在靜安寺路上閒走，大家談談家國大事，也談談各自的生活問題。</p>
<p>忽然，陳君棄置了我，同另一位朋友在親熱的談話起來，隨又招呼我過去，並爲我介紹。我是不會交際的，對於應酬上的藝術，實在欠缺得很。可是那位朋友，恰和我相反，對於我的姓名，籍貫，職業，住址，問得很詳盡，大有一見如故的樣子。</p>
<p>過後，我差不多記不起了，那位朋友的姓名。只知道那位朋友，是浙江××縣人，現在在上海做一個巡官。</p>
<p>前天下午，忽然接到一個紅帖，是由陳君轉交過來的。我以爲陳君有什麽可喜可賀的事了，拆開一看，令我莫名其妙，好久好久，才記起了靜安寺路上遇見的那位巡官。事情是他的兒子的「湯餅之喜，」請我去吃湯餅，眞是客氣極了。但他細看下去，後面還有一行小字，是「席設浙江××縣本宅。」我想，我的吃運不佳，這麽遠的路，要趁船，要趁車，只爲了一餐吃，未免太不上算吧。</p>
<p>今天午後，陳君跑到我這裏來，問我可曾收到一個紅帖，我就回答他說：「對不起，我是抱禮不往來主義的。一則，没有錢送禮，二則，送這種禮，一點没有意思。而且，這明明是做着一本千利的好生意，我更不主張去送。」</p>
<p>陳君抱歉地對我笑說道：「那是我對不起你了。上半天我已去送了四元禮，是你我二人具名的，此刻我就是來通知你一聲的，不料你是！！」</p>
<p>我没有辦法，只好拿出兩隻洋來，還給陳君。我笑着說：「那末，老陳，他是席設浙江××縣本宅，你打算去不去呢？」</p>
<p>陳君搖了搖頭，笑着跑去了，我想：這次一本千利的好生意，終究給那位朋友做成功了。</p>

<h3 id="c227">喉痧譚要 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 濟華</p>
<p>喉痧是急性傳染病。凡稍知醫藥常識者。皆能明瞭。但欲預防喉痧之傳染。確是難能。蓋喉痧之傳染。有不可思議之迅速。每有沿户闔境。互相傳染者。甚而有早發夕死。夕發早亡者。暴厲夭扎。殊深悲憫。</p>
<p>喉痧之起源</p>
<p>此症發於秋夏季者少。春季次之。冬季最多。冬令氣候本應寒冷。而反溫暖。内經云，非其時而有其氣。釀成疫癘之邪也。咽開竅於肺。喉開竅於胃。咽喉乃肺胃之門户。邪從口鼻入於肺胃暴寒朿於外。疫毒蘊於内。蒸鬱於肺胃兩經。肝胆之火。乘勢上亢。於是喉痧成矣。喉痧之症狀</p>
<p>喉痧之症狀。壯熱面赤。週身骨痠。咽喉腐爛嚥飲不利。痧子先見於頭面。再見於胸脇。此爲喉痧之正狀。若經治後。始終無汗。痧子不能透達。而現蒂丁腐去·音噁氣急者。則爲難治，</p>
<p>喉痧之鑑别</p>
<p>喉症有疫喉。白喉·喉風·喉痺·之分别。痧症有正痧。風痧·紅痧·痧痲·之各異。單發喉症。而不現痧子。或單發痧子。而不現喉症者。均不得謂之喉痧。喉痧一症。乃天行之邪氣。不能與普通之喉症痧症相比。必痧症喉症同時發現。始得謂之喉痧。</p>
<p>小兒與喉痧</p>
<p>小兒體質未充。臟腑嬌弱。易於感受時邪。然亦有單發痧症。略有咽痛。而不腐爛者。此係胎中伏熱。與時邪而發。非傳染之喉症也。其症大抵身熱咳嗽。煩躁泛噁。若見咽喉腐爛。痧子隱隱不透者。則是喉痧矣。急須延醫診治喉痧之預防</p>

<h3 id="c228">肺癆淺說 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 錫毅</p>
<p>定義</p>
<p>咳嗽日久不愈。見疲勞症狀者。謂之肺癆。原因</p>
<p>肺癆之原因有三，一，由於外感。一，由於内傷。一，由於遺傳。由於外感者。因感冐風邪。或爲寒冷所迫。肺氣受威逼。久而不愈。轉成肺癆。由於内傷者。因終日勞動。日光與新鮮空氣不能充份享受。食物又乏於滋養。以致肺部日受障害。喪失其抵抗能力。轉成肺癆。由於遺傳者。因父母之肺癆病毒傳於兒體。兒體日長。病毒亦日深。往往十八九歲卽夭亡。症象</p>
<p>肺癆之症象。分爲三期。第一時期。咳嗽胸痛。第二時期。咳嗽胸痛兼氣急吐血。第三期。咳嗽胸痛氣急吐血顴紅音噁。各症俱備。</p>
<p>病理</p>
<p>西醫論肺癆。專重於結核桿菌。結核之桿菌。其形如細桿。長約赤血球三分之一。有脂狀。或臘狀。物質被於其外。余讀巢氏病源。亦云，肺蟲如蠶。可見肺癆有蟲無疑。但肺癆旣是一種菌體。病人痰唾内之病菌。遺於塵埃。隨風播散。人人有傳染肺癆之機會。何以病者自病。不病者終不病。這就是人體抵抗力强盛。病毒不易潛入也。試看有肺病死者。其經過之症象。必由淺而深。由漸而甚。决不致一患肺癆。即現第三期之症象也。</p>
<p>治法</p>
<p>肺癆之治法。最緊要就是咳嗽。因爲肺之一呼一吸。均有一定常態。肺管中受有障碍。肺氣不能順循呼吸解於是起反動作用。咳嗽頻作矣。但咳嗽亦要觀猛烈與和緩。咳嗽猛烈。病勢尙輕。可用宣肺之藥。咳嗽和緩。病勢較重。可用清肺化痰之品。使其痰濁易於吐出。咳嗽而見吐血氣急音噁骨蒸等症。虚象已現。急須大劑補肺肅肺之品。保其元氣。元氣得復。再與清肺肅肺養肺等品。循環調服。使其病毒袪盡自愈。若三期肺病元氣已脫。脾胃亦無力消化。妙法雖多。回春恐難望矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Good Diplomatic Situation Before the League of Nations Meeting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Japanese diplomatic strategy has always been known for its flexibility and cunning. Before the September 18th Incident last year, Japan saw that the major powers were all struggling with economic turmoil and had no energy to spare for events in the Far East. At the same time, with the rising power of Soviet Russia, Japan believed that it would not be easily accepted by capitalist countries. Japan, geographically closest to Soviet Russia, subtly positioned itself as the first line of defense for the capitalist alliance, using this to gain the major powers' non-interference in the Far East as a condition. After the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident, when the Japanese saw the League of Nations paying close attention, they repeatedly spread rumors of Soviet mobilization to divert international attention. Later, seeing the growing animosity of the United States towards Japan and the inevitability of a future Pacific War, Japan changed its anti-Soviet policy to a pro-Soviet one, making concessions on fishing disputes and proceeding with a non-aggression treaty, doing everything possible. Japan intended to view the United States as an extremely capitalist country, making it unlikely to join hands with Soviet Russia for the time being. Therefore, Japan wanted to seize the initiative with clever tactics. In reality, everyone already knew Japan's aggressive policies. Neither the United States nor Russia had any goodwill towards Japan. Japan's sudden alliance with one party and then another only reveals its futile efforts. Recent reports indicate that the future US President Roosevelt and the future Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Swanson, agree to recognize Soviet Russia after taking office. This is a drastic change in US policy towards the Far East and is enough to make the Japanese panic. Although the future remains to be seen, it is certainly more than just empty words. This is a new threat to Japan's diplomacy. 1. Resolutions against Japan at League of Nations meetings have repeatedly been approached with extreme caution and compromise, yet the Japanese still brazenly acted fiercely and stubbornly, ignoring them. The League of Nations members cannot but be aware of the loss of their credibility, simply because of the lack of strong power and differing opinions, so they have not been able to make a strong statement. The current proposal to establish a new international committee is to invite the United States and Russia to participate outside the League of Nations members to jointly seek ways to resolve the Far East issue. Although the true nature of this meeting is still not fully understood, it can be understood that it intends to use the concentrated power of the world to jointly curb unscrupulous violence. This is a new threat to Japan's diplomacy. 2. Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, France's attitude has always been suspected of favoring Japan. Since the United States exchanged the abandonment of war debt relations for France's change in policy towards the Far East, Japan has suffered a major blow. Recently, the French government announced its proposed arms reduction plan, which fully explained the preparations for curbing aggressive countries, and proposed organizing an international air force and special forces to be placed under the command of the League of Nations, and allowing the League of Nations to stockpile armaments so that they can be delivered to attacked countries when necessary to provide self-defense. Although this proposal may not be directed at Japan, as the most aggressive country, how can Japan conveniently make an exception for itself? This is a new threat to Japan's diplomacy. 3. The Japanese, as a whole, as a result of excessive aggression, have gradually lost the sympathy of the world. The Japanese have now realized that they are increasingly isolated diplomatically, and the warlords' ambitions are unwilling to change easily. Therefore, they can only use their extremely boring and赖 policies to do their best to denounce China, spreading the propaganda that our Republic is not a country, hoping to stir the League of Nations' hearing with this kind of slanderous and outrageous remarks, in order to salvage their diplomatic decline. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an opinion yesterday, already denouncing China to its heart's content. Matsuoka Yosuke also made the same remarks to reporters in Geneva today. Although the people in the League of Nations all have eyes and ears and may not be deceived by his fallacies, our Chinese authorities must make a dignified statement to shut his poisonous mouth. Moreover, in this opportunity of diplomatic activity, we should pay attention to two points: 1. Quickly eliminate internal strife and seek a unified approach, so that slander cannot find its way in. 2. Determine diplomatic response policies and properly deploy diplomatic forces to make the final forceful negotiations on the League of Nations platform. In this matter, our country is in a defeated position militarily, but in terms of international sympathy, it has not yet reached a point where it cannot be salvaged at all. If we still do not know how to seize the opportunity and lose it carelessly, then there will truly be no place for our country to survive in the vast universe.</p>

<h3 id="e2">### The Garrison in Luxian Withdraws Outside the City; All Sectors Organize a Temporary Relief Committee for the War Zone; Request that the Chongqing Army Cease Bombing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) Luxian has been bombed by the Chongqing army, causing more than 300 civilian casualties and destroying most of the houses. The provincial army has withdrawn outside the city, and all sectors have organized a temporary relief committee for the war zone, requesting that the Chongqing army cease bombing to save lives. It is reported that the provincial army will retreat to Xufu if necessary, demonstrating continuous concessions. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun returned to Nanjing on the Jianghua Wheel on the evening of the 19th. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the conflict between Liu Wenhui and Tian Songyao's troops in Chengdu, Liu telegraphed the central government from Sichuan, requesting the dismissal of Tian. Tian also sent a telegram to Nanjing on the 17th, stating that Liu was harming the country and the people and requesting a thorough investigation by the central government. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chongqing telegraphed that the Chengdu fighting has not stopped. Tian and Deng's troops have occupied all the city gates and deployed sentries everywhere. The rebel army withdrew outside the city due to interception, and order has not yet been restored. After the collapse of the 24th Army along the Tuojiang River, they retreated towards Xufu and Jiading. Yang, Luo, and Tian's troops are advancing towards Jiading, and the 20th Army is responsible for attacking Xuzhou. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain organization in Nanjing received a telegram from Chongqing on the 19th, stating that the Allied forces captured Zi Nei Fu Lu on the 17th night, and the 24th Army immediately showed signs of collapse. At the same time, Pan Wenhua and Tang Shizun's divisions completely occupied Fushun on the morning of the 18th, and Xu Yaoqing's brigade occupied Zigong. Luzhou was surrounded on all sides. The 20th Army launched a general offensive on four fronts on the morning of the 19th and is expected to occupy it. 2. The units of the 24th Army in Chengdu, Zizhou, Fushun, and Luzhou have been repeatedly defeated by the Allied forces in the past two or three days. With the Tuojiang defense line broken, there is no danger to defend along the Minjiang River, and the war is rapidly heading towards a turning point. Another organization received a telegram from Chengdu stating that Tian Songyao transferred Liu Hanxiong's troops to the province. Liu Wenhui simultaneously placed Liu Hanxiong under house arrest and besieged the troops he brought. Deng Xihou's brigade commander, Xian Wenjun, was assassinated by someone bought by Liu Wenhui's troops. Therefore, Deng and Tian were furious and decided to drive Liu Wenhui out of Chengdu. There was a fierce battle in Chengdu. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The Armies of Jiang Province are in Full Cooperation</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed on the 17th, stating that according to intelligence reports, Koiso, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, requested peace negotiations with our army but was unsuccessful. He then agreed with Japanese Army Minister Araki and Vice Chief of Staff Masaki to launch a large-scale attack on our Fularji, Zhalantun, Ningnian, Keshan, and Baiquan. Since the 16th, the Japanese army has been advancing from Longjiang in all directions, transporting supplies and weapons without leaving anything behind. Once Koiso returns to Manzhouli, he will command the armies to begin attacking us. A major battle is imminent, and our army is standing ready, determined to fight to the end even if we have only one soldier left. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed Ping on the 16th, stating that according to Zhang Dianjiu's report from Hulhula, on the morning of the 13th, more than 1,000 Japanese rebel troops advanced towards our garrison in the Dong Halari Huerwen Dalaha area, using field artillery to bombard them with extremely fierce firepower. Our army responded calmly. At 2:00 PM, three formations of Japanese aircraft, a total of 21, bombed our positions, dropping more than 50 bombs. After half an hour, they drove east. However, our army's positions were solid and there was no major damage. At 8:00 PM, the troops, fearing the cold, withdrew, destroying more than 30 houses. No soldiers were killed, but 12 civilians were killed. Li Haiqing also reported that his troops were waiting for an opportunity around Ang'angxi to harass the vicinity of Anda. A part of Liu's brigade was also stationed there, and he himself was directing the battle at Jiangqiao. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Approximately 33,000 volunteers have gathered near Baiquan, preparing to go south. The Japanese-Manchu allied forces have begun their defenses, and a fierce battle seems imminent. The Japanese-Manchu allied forces have the help of aircraft, while the volunteers have neither fighter planes nor anti-aircraft guns, so the Japanese-Manchu army clearly has the advantage. However, the final outcome of this battle is still difficult to say. The Japanese-Manchu army has now set off from five locations: Keshan, Taianzhen, Hailun, Anda Station, and Caoheji. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Koiso, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, who was on his way to Tokyo to have a final discussion with the central government regarding the Su Bingwen issue, passed through here this morning at 10:00 AM en route to Tokyo. (19th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) On the 16th, Japanese people in Manchuria held a meeting of Japanese residents, all of whom requested reinforcements. Therefore, Koiso's visit to Beijing is of great importance to Japan's highest policy on these matters and is worthy of attention. (19th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>On the 18th, Aviation Lieutenant Takemori Shunichi of Qiqihar took off from Keshan for reconnaissance flight, when he was suddenly hit by enemy fire in the leg. But he bravely endured the wound and operated the plane back to Keshan, completing his mission. (19th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable reports, on October 14, Chairman Ma Zhanshan led more than 1,000 cavalrymen to [redacted] Station to meet with Su Bingwen. The armies of Jiang Province have completely cooperated. (18th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen's army has repeatedly performed miracles, and the Japanese army is exhausted in dealing with them. International views have been refreshed. However, Su is isolated between Fularji and Manzhouli, a region that does not produce grain. Supplies must be obtained from outside. Su receives very little assistance from home and abroad and is in great distress. The Japanese army has taken advantage of this weakness to repeatedly try to persuade him to cooperate, but Su has consistently refused. Su previously received a telegram from his father, Xin Quan, saying, "It is the right time to dedicate yourself to the country." He replied that he would follow the instructions and vowed to be loyal, resisting no matter the difficulties. This shows Su's determination. (18th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Kwantung Army Commander Muto has issued a mobilization order, ordering the air force, tank unit, cavalry unit, mountain artillery unit, field artillery unit, signal unit, and poison gas unit to be dispatched in shifts to Heilongjiang Province. The Japanese army's main camp for attacking Su Bingwen's army is in Qiqihar, and the forward headquarters will be set up in Zhalantun. The dispatched Japanese army is scheduled to gather in Zhalantun to await orders. The people of Northeast China expect a Russian-Japanese conflict to be imminent, and people's hearts are wavering. The Japanese army fears that the rear will be chaotic and that the volunteer army will take the opportunity to encircle them. Today, they issued a notice to reassure the people, saying that Russian-Japanese relations are very close and that a sudden conflict is unlikely. However, the people still cannot fully believe the Japanese army's notice. (19th Hualian News Agency Telegram)</p>

On the afternoon of the 13th, according to reports from our army in the vicinity of Jilin, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army at Huapichang for several hours. The Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Aierjie, 80 miles from Jigen, to hold their position, capturing a considerable amount of firearms and ammunition.

There is no change in the defense of this province. He has not heard anything about Feng returning to live in Shandong. Han is actively inspecting the units that have returned from Jiaodong these days. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Zhang Chucun, Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters stationed in Yantai, telegraphed Shen Honglie on the 18th, reporting that as of the 18th, seven transport ships have arrived in Yantai, namely Tai Shun, Jian An, Xing Shi, Yu Ji, Tong Hua, Yu Shun, Xin Feng, and Yu Shun, which can carry approximately 8,000 troops and 150 horses. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shahe telegraphed that Liu's supplies in Ye County have begun to be transported to Yantai. The landmines buried by Liu's troops near Yecheng have not been completely removed, and the electrical bureau workers are still unable to repair the utility poles. As of the evening of the 18th, Liu was still in Laiyang. Another telegram stated that most of Liu's army in Laiyang has already departed, with only a small number of infantry remaining. Only an infantry battalion has departed in Ye County, and most of the troops have not yet moved. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Jiang ordered on the 14th that Liu Zhennian's division be entirely stationed in eastern Zhejiang, the Transportation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs began to prepare ships.

Twelve ships have been chartered, including Sheng An, Rong An, Song Fu, Qing Ning, Xin Feng, Shi He, Yu Ran, Tong Hua, Yong Xing, Xing Shi, Tai Shun, and Yu Shun, which have been successively transporting the troops to Yantai. The division's office in Nanjing sent Secretary Wu to Ningbo on the 18th to inspect the stationing location. There are rumors that Minister He telegraphed the division to be reorganized into a Class B division. According to Yang Licuan, the division was originally a Class B division and does not need to be reorganized. Minister He had previously indicated that the division could be selectively downsized before being deployed to Shandong, and he has telegraphed this intention to Division Commander Liu to follow.

<p>Our Diplomatic Authorities Are Studying Its Contents and Will Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report was submitted to the Secretariat of the League of Nations on the 18th. It can be said that its肆意 slander against us and荒謬 rhetoric have reached the extreme. The full text of the opinion paper has not been formally delivered to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but when a certain important government official learned about the contents through a Japanese Cabinet resolution passed on the first of this month, he strongly refuted and deeply criticized it. According to the intention of the diplomatic authorities, the investigation team was formally dispatched by the Administrative Council of the League of Nations and, with the consent of China and Japan, sent personnel to participate, which has a legal basis. Japan's submitted opinion paper has no legal basis and is therefore insignificant. Moreover, when Lytton drafted the report, he tried his best to listen to the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The Japanese representative, Yoshida, tried his best to submit說帖, but Lytton did not adopt them because what was said was not true. The opinion paper now submitted by Japan is what Lytton discarded on that day, which shows that what is said is not accurate. Whether the government will completely refute this will be decided after receiving the full text. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) An important diplomatic figure talked about the most central issue in the upcoming discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue at the League of Nations Administrative Council, which is said to be based on the principle in Chapters 1 to 8 of the Lytton Report that the territory and administrative sovereignty of the Northeast belong to China. If this issue is passed, the issue of Japan's responsibility for sending troops to invade China during the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident can be easily resolved.

After studying the content, our diplomatic authorities will discuss countermeasures in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the near future so that Japan's fabricated words can be exposed to all countries in the world.

According to a report by British engineer Milles, if the protruding Wolf Mountain area in the Jiangyin-Nantong area is not rectified, the Yangtze River may change its course to enter the sea without passing through Wusong, which would greatly impact the prosperity of Shanghai. A survey team has been dispatched to Jiangyin to continue surveying for construction. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>▲TASS Moscow, 18th: Soviet coal production has increased significantly in recent years and now ranks fourth in the world. The first, second, and third places are occupied by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. In 1921, the total coal production of the Soviet Union was 5,700,000 tons, while in the first nine months of this year, it has already reached 47,000,000 tons. Revolutionary Russia only produced 2,900,000 tons of coal. Currently, the main coal mines in the Soviet Union are Kuznetsk, Karaganda, the Far East, and Central Asia. During the second Five-Year Plan, Soviet coal production will increase even more. The countries with the largest coal reserves in the world are the United States and Canada, followed by the Soviet Union in third place. The Soviet Union has discovered coal reserves estimated at approximately 110 billion tons, of which 85% is mineral coal and 15% is woody coal.</p>

<p>Guo Taiqi Vigorously Refutes Matsuoka's Absurdities</p>
<p>Procedural Issues Will Be Submitted to Jurists for Review</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 18th: As the time for the League of Nations Council to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute draws near, Geneva has become a battlefield for a fierce verbal duel between the representatives of China and Japan. Today, Matsuoka and Guo Taiqi exchanged heated arguments. Matsuoka told foreign journalists that although some consider Japan an aggressor, Japan itself has long been subjected to aggression. Japanese troops have never invaded foreign land, and the presence of Japanese troops in Manchuria is merely to protect its unquestionable rights. Chinese sovereignty is purely nominal, and Japan's claims are not contrary to the claims of other countries, nor are they contrary to the claims of the Chinese themselves. The disturbed state of Manchuria is harmful to world peace. Japan respects the rights of other countries but also wants other countries to respect Japan's rights. The "new state of Manchuria" seems to offer the best guarantee for the welfare of the local people and the protection of the interests of foreigners. Japan wants to continue this new experiment and has no other choice. After Matsuoka made these remarks, Guo Taiqi quickly refuted them, saying that the Japanese representative was making grand pronouncements and reiterating the old arguments of Japan's military actions, referring to Japan's actions in the three eastern provinces of China as acts of self-defense and claiming that Chinese administration was in a state of lawlessness. He should know that China has been pursuing the rule of law and not adopting assassinations, which are not uncommon in Japan's political disputes and are regarded as commonplace. The Chinese civilian government is able to control military policy, at least as much as the Japanese government has been able to rule the military and government in the past eighteen months.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 19th: The procedural debate at the League of Nations Council meeting on Monday will be a key point in the meeting. Japan believes that discussion outside the Council meeting would not be beneficial, while China demands that the Lytton Report be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen or that a special session of the League of Nations General Assembly be convened for discussion. The participation of many small countries that are stronger in principle and weaker in responsibility in the Committee of Nineteen and the League of Nations General Assembly will benefit China and allow the entire issue to receive a more rapid and rigorous disposition. Therefore, Monday's discussion will involve the interpretation of Articles 10, 12, and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, and the final solution may be to submit the issue to jurists for review and decision.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 18th: Diplomats attending the League of Nations gathered today to discuss plans to organize a diplomatic corps based on the practice of diplomatic representatives stationed in capital cities around the world. After discussions, it was decided to proceed with the organization and to regard the Secretary-General of the League of Nations as the permanent "head of state" of the "country" in which the diplomats are stationed. Canadian representative R. Dandurand has been elected as the leader of the new diplomatic corps.</p>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: According to diplomatic sources in Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches importance to secret contacts in dealing with the League of Nations. Matsudaira is in charge of relations with Britain, Nagaoka is in charge of relations with France, Yoshida is in charge of relations with Italy, and Matsuoka is free to act in any way to win over major powers and suppress small powers as a basic strategy. At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, Matsuoka and Nagaoka visited British Foreign Secretary Simon, earnestly requesting Britain to remember the old friendship between Britain and Japan and to help Japan in its current crisis. Japan can take a calm attitude toward European issues, but it has to be enthusiastic about its Manchurian policy. If the major powers cannot show sympathy, the trend will be unpredictable, half-begging and half-threatening, urging Britain. As for France, it repeatedly proposed a Franco-Japanese alliance as bait to restrain Germany and Russia. From major countries to small countries, coaxing, lamenting, threatening, and enticing, all diplomatic tricks were used to escape danger and avoid discussion of the Manchurian case at the General Assembly.</p>

<p>▲Female Aviator Amy Johnson</p>
<p>▲Sets New Record Between England and Australia</p>
<p>Flying Over 20,000 Miles in Four and a Half Days</p>
<p>▲Kapur Town, 18th: Female aviator Amy Johnson achieved a new record for her flight from England to Australia, winning praise throughout the British Empire. Australian manufacturer Widerlaw is now giving her a gift of 1,000 British pounds. It is noted that Amy Johnson's husband, Mollison, was also given 1,000 pounds by Widerlaw when he broke the record for flying from Australia to England. Amy Johnson felt very tired during the final leg of her journey, and the plane was found to have sustained some damage, but it was repaired without much delay. Mrs. Mollison's trip from England to Australia took four days, six hours, and fifty-two minutes for 6,200 miles. Her husband's record was four days, seventeen hours, and thirty-two minutes. This extraordinarily courageous female aviator, after receiving a grand welcome from the crowd, immediately telephoned London to talk to her husband. Mollison told her that this achievement was not only her personal glory but also enhanced Britain's aviation glory, and that the fatigue of a long-distance flight was considerable. Amy replied that although she was tired, she was still able to talk. The female aviator told people that she found the night flight from Duala to Bangui particularly difficult. The aircraft she was flying was a Moth aircraft equipped with a 130-horsepower engine and a special fuel tank that could carry 120 gallons of fuel, so her range could be increased from 650 miles to 1,850 miles (Reuters).</p>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Japanese government, due to the serious situation at the League of Nations, the military representatives Colonel Ishiwara of the Army and Colonel Okano of the Navy, one claiming to be a founding hero of Manchuria and the other claiming to have contributed to the Shanghai War, each relying on the power of the army and navy, are often overstepping their authority. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, fearing that the military's lack of understanding of the situation would spoil the overall situation, came up with a plan to prevent internal strife among the Japanese representatives: 1) Promote Matsuoka Yosuke as the chief representative of Japan and grant him full authority; 2) Disputes within the delegation will be decided by Matsuoka at his discretion; 3) Those who do not accept Matsuoka's decision will be expelled. It is heard that this plan was proposed by Prime Minister Saito at yesterday's cabinet meeting and approved by all ministers. A telegram was sent to Matsuoka this morning ordering him to comply. It can be seen that the internal strife within the Japanese delegation before the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly is also very severe.</p>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The 69th League of Nations Council meeting is scheduled to open at 11 a.m. on the 21st in Geneva, with Lerera as the speaker. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs initially expressed optimism about the future of the League of Nations, but since yesterday, the telegrams received have been contrary to expectations. It was initially determined that influencing Britain and France could dominate the overall situation at the Council. Since yesterday, the situation has changed, and many member countries are resentful of Britain and France's past abuse of the League of Nations to suppress small countries. As a result, the small countries have formed an unexpectedly strong group, and the reliance on British policy may be difficult to achieve. The League of Nations General Assembly cannot be avoided. The policy of enticing with secret meetings is about to be declared bankrupt. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received this news and was extremely depressed, and the financial community was also quite pessimistic.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Geneva, 19th: The Japanese Ambassador to France, Okunaga, visited Davis, the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, this morning.

<p>Soviet Russian Official Newspapers Discuss the Non-Aggression Treaty Negotiations</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 19th: Soviet Russian official newspapers today criticized the Japanese newspapers' proposal that the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" should conclude a non-aggression treaty to replace the Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty. They said that the Soviet Union may be prepared to conclude such a treaty in order to promote peace in the Far East, but unless it is supplemented by a similar Russo-Japanese treaty, a treaty of this nature will be ineffective. This is because, according to the Japan-Manchukuo military agreement, the full protection rights of Manchuria have been transferred to the hands of the Japanese army. The Japanese army will be permanently stationed in Manchuria under this agreement.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Moscow, 18th: The Russian Central Meteorological Observatory today guaranteed that Russia and Northern Europe will experience an extremely cold winter. This is based on the observation records of the Soviet Russian Arctic Expedition, which recently completed its mission.

<p>Satisfactory Result After One Hour of Discussions</p>
<p>Final Decision to Be Made Within the Next Week</p>
<p>Will Hitler Be the German Chancellor?</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 19th: The headquarters of the National Socialist Party announced that the result of today's meeting between Hitler and President Hindenburg was quite satisfactory, but the party refused to say whether Hitler insisted on being appointed as Chancellor. The President has now scheduled to meet with Hitler again next week, so many believe that Hitler has proven to be more approachable than during the political turmoil in July of this year.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 19th: It has just been learned from reliable sources that after Hitler met with the President this morning, he asked the President whether he would object to handing over political power to the National Socialist Party and whether he would object to appointing him as Chancellor. The President replied that he did not object in principle, but he could not unconditionally appoint him as Chancellor, and then put forward two conditions: 1) Hitler's adoption of any economic plan must be similar to the Papen Plan and must not deviate from the outline already implemented by Papen; 2) The President must make the final decision on the selection of cabinet members. Hitler then asked for a few days to consider, and the President agreed, arranging to discuss again within the next week before parting.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 19th: President Hindenburg and National Socialist Party leader Hitler gathered this afternoon. Police and plainclothes National Socialist Party members patrolled the streets to maintain order and prevent accidents. The details of the meeting were not published in the newspapers. The meeting lasted about an hour. Whenever Hitler entered or left the Presidential Palace, many National Socialist Party members cheered. It is heard that the President retained his right to make a decision and did not promise Hitler anything. Many expect that Hitler must have asked for the opportunity to govern the country. Today, the President will meet with the leader of the Bavarian People's Party and then discuss the next steps with his advisors. It is expected that Hitler will contact the Center Party in order to form a coalition government supported by the two People's Parties and the National Right Party. This afternoon's meeting between the President and Hitler is highly valued by the entire country. The President will use his personal power to mobilize all parties, wanting a government that has the genuine support of the public rather than just a majority on paper. It is only after discussing with the leaders of the various parties that a future plan will be decided, but a decision may not be made until the end of next week. If the President is forced to act on his own, he will give the current government greater power and expand it to avoid the responsibility of being manipulated by a minority of aristocrats, saying that the President is well aware that the current diplomatic and political work cannot be delayed and wants a strong government to meet the turning point in the economic tide.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 18th: The German political turmoil is temporarily at a standstill, waiting for the results of the President's meeting with the leaders of the various parties. Today, the President first met with Hugenberg, the leader of the National Right Party, followed by Katz, the leader of the Center Party, and then Tingertai, the leader of the German People's Party. However, the discussions at this time are still exploratory, and everything depends on the results of tomorrow's meeting between the President and Hitler. Hitler arrived in Beijing by private plane from Munich this afternoon, accompanied by several of his closest advisors, including Len Strasser, which shows that the National Socialist Party attaches great importance to this move. It is expected that if the President and Hitler can reach an understanding, Strasser is likely to become Chancellor. In addition, Goering, the former Speaker of the Reichstag, who is also being touted as a successor to the Chancellorship, also rushed to Berlin by plane from Rome this afternoon. Rumors that the National Socialist Party is divided internally have been firmly denied by the party.</p>
<p>According to the German World Newspaper, Hitler and the key figures in his party are well aware of the importance of the matter and are determined to abandon past misunderstandings and do their best to open up cooperation with the President and other political parties, but will insist on the following two requirements: first, there must be a broad plan to give jobs to the unemployed; second, the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations must be strictly prohibited. The newspaper believes that today, with the exception of Hitler, the majority</p>

<p>Enters von Papen's Office, Arrested, Court Sentences Her to Three Months in Prison</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, October 18 (Reuters) A woman, carrying a knife, attempted to enter the Premier's office several days ago, but was stopped by a guard. However, the woman evaded the guard and entered the Premier's office, where she was immediately arrested. She was brought before the court today and sentenced to three months in prison. According to the woman's testimony, she only wanted to persuade the Premier to change his policies; otherwise, she would use the knife against him.</p>
<p>There is no other way to hold onto power than a cabinet favored by the president. It would be best if Mr. Hitler could form such a cabinet. Otherwise, the president will consider asking someone from another party to form a national unity cabinet. If this also fails, the president will face the most serious problems and the most serious decisions. The newspaper concluded by saying that although forming a cabinet controlled by the National Socialist Party might involve some risks in domestic and foreign affairs, it is the largest party and must be given a chance to save Germany. ▲ Berlin, October 18 (Reuters) The President today issued an order prohibiting political gatherings before January 2.</p>

<p>The Key Lies in Roosevelt's Attitude</p>
<p>▲ Washington, October 18 (Kuo Min News Agency) US President Hoover today presented the war debt issue to the cabinet for discussion. However, after the meeting, none of the participants were willing to comment. It is now believed that Hoover has proposed a plan to re-establish the War Debt Funding Commission. The members of Congress invited to the White House meeting on Wednesday have all replied to the President, confirming their attendance on schedule. House Democratic leader Rainey reiterated today his opposition to canceling or reducing the debt. Representative Pou, a Democrat and chairman of the House Rules Committee, stated today that his actions would largely depend on the attitude of President-elect Roosevelt. Any bill to postpone payments must first be passed by the committee before it can be formally put on the agenda. However, given the current situation, fewer people are inclined to oppose a reasonable extension of the moratorium. Therefore, several parties have assured that Congress will pass an extension bill, but it will be attached with certain reservations against reduction or cancellation, and a new repayment date will be specified. The US President has not yet formally expressed his view on the war debt issue, but it is said that he is optimistic since Roosevelt has agreed to cooperate, as Roosevelt's attitude will certainly sway the Democratic members of both houses. If the two parties can reach an agreement, it is expected that this bill may be passed before December 15.</p>

<p>▲ Moscow, October 18 (Kuo Min News Agency) Negotiations for a Russo-French trade agreement, which have been delayed for a long time due to detailed preparations, are now expected to begin in Paris before the end of this month. To facilitate a compromise, it has been decided to put aside the debt issue. However, it is said that France still insists on finding a way to equalize trade between the two countries, so that Soviet Russia does not continue to have a trade surplus as it has had in the past.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Japanese Political Turmoil Brewing: Premier Saitō Visited Prince Saionji Yesterday; Andō Advocates the Establishment of an Emergency Cabinet <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tokyo, October 19 (Dentsu) Premier Saitō left Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM today for the Saigyō-sō villa in Okitsu to visit Prince Saionji. He reported in detail on the compilation of the next year's budget and the government's League of Nations policy, and expressed various opinions on the current situation. On his way back, the Premier went to his Hayama villa and is scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 21st.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, October 19 (Dentsu) The Kokumin Domei (National League) studied its attitude toward next year's budget, with Chairman Adachi at the center. Yesterday's standing committee reached a general conclusion. Adachi issued a statement in the form of a talk, as follows: "The government's budget compilation policy does not seek any new solutions to the root causes of today's stalemate, but only leaves behind doubled harm for the future. According to the government's budget, it will issue 1 billion yen in deficit bonds. If this continues, the total amount of public debt will reach 10 billion yen, and all tax revenue will be taken up by public debt interest and pensions. The future of public finance is extremely worrying. It is heard that the government also fears criticism from the world and has a plan to establish a financial advisory body. However, starting the investigation at this point will only waste time and will not be enough to address the current extraordinary financial situation. It is necessary to compile an extraordinary budget that saves both the internal and external situation, and at the same time, to carry out fundamental political and economic reforms. However, given the weakness of the current cabinet, how can we expect such a major reform? We believe that the most urgent task at hand is the emergence of a truly powerful emergency cabinet with the mission of saving the situation."</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, October 19 (Dentsu) Minister of Education Hatoyama visited Minister of Finance Takahashi yesterday afternoon at the behest of President Suzuki of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) to ask for his views on next year's budget and his confidence in the Diet. The Minister of Finance replied that looking at the situation in other countries, there is no need to be so pessimistic about issuing deficit bonds. I have resolved to sacrifice myself in this difficult situation and will face the regular Diet session with this determination. After exchanging opinions, Minister of Education Hatoyama left at 3:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, Secretary-General Matsuno and Chief Secretary Yamaguchi of the Seiyūkai visited Minister of Education Hatoyama to hear the details of the meeting with Finance Minister Takahashi. They then held important discussions on their attitude towards the government. However, because there is various criticism of the budget in the world, and the Seiyūkai's position cannot be to attack the government head-on, the relationship between the Seiyūkai and the government is very delicate. The Seiyūkai attaches great importance to Premier Saitō's visit to Prince Saionji and expects a great deal from his subsequent meeting with President Suzuki. Therefore, they plan to observe the situation before deciding on their attitude towards the budget.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, October 19 (Dentsu) The second naval replenishment plan for the 1933 fiscal year is 43.85 million yen. However, the total naval budget reaches 460 million yen, so the financial burden for the next year is very large. As a result of consultations between Premier Saitō, Navy Minister Okada, and Finance Minister Takahashi, the original plan was withdrawn and replaced with the following plan: three special-purpose ships, construction costs of 15 million yen, and ship modification costs of 26.0688 million yen, which will be compensated by the revival of approved funds. The distribution of the revived approved funds of 45 million yen is roughly as follows: 35.0688 million yen for the above two planned expenses, 6.563 million yen for exchange rate losses, and 2.649 million yen for other expenses. Furthermore, the Navy insists that a portion of the second replenishment plan be included in the 1934 budget, but the Ministry of Finance is reluctant due to financial constraints, so it is feared that it will be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, October 19 (Hua Lian News Agency) Since the Japanese exchange rate against the US dollar fell again yesterday, the market remains sluggish. The afternoon closing fell to a recent selling price of 19 and 3/4 US cents, breaking the 20 US cent barrier. According to observations by Japanese financial circles, there are four reasons for the fall in the exchange rate: 1. Due to the fall in the US stock market; 2. The League of Nations' sentiment towards Japan has deteriorated, and Japan is becoming increasingly isolated internationally; 3. Implementing the troop increase in northern Manchuria has become an unavoidable situation, and there is still pessimism about the future of the troop increase;</p>
<p>4. Japan's foreign trade surplus has decreased significantly, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, October 19 (Hua Lian News Agency) The Japanese political situation is very stable on the surface, but there are deep undercurrents. The League of Nations situation is also not optimistic. The military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are gradually becoming antagonistic. The zaibatsu (financial cliques) are very concerned about the future of public finances, and their attitude is increasingly different from that of the military.

<p>▲ The World's Largest Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, Opens</p>
<p>▲ Moscow's Views and Inspections of the Lytton Report</p>
<p>▲ The Question of the Soviet Russian and Romanian Signing of a Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, a central project in the Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan and watched by the whole world, officially opened on the 10th of this month. The Dnieper Dam and all its affiliated projects began in November 1927 and have taken exactly five years to complete. It used more than 15,000 workers and cost 800 million rubles. The power plant can supply 810,000 horsepower and 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. All industries and transportation in the new industrial area, as well as the metallurgical industry in southern Ukraine, rely on it for electricity. It is truly one of the world's largest hydroelectric projects. A grand opening ceremony was held on the 10th of this month. The chairman of the Soviet Russian Workers' and Peasants' Government, Mr. Kalinin, together with the chairman of the Industrial Committee, Mr. Osokini, were guided by the chief engineer, Mr. Ventzel, and Mr. Michelson to inspect the dam on the evening of the 9th. At a height of 60 meters above the Dnieper River, Lenin's last words were projected: "Soviet power plus electrification is socialism." On the right bank of the river, Stalin's words, "The Bolsheviks are invincible," were also projected. Tens of thousands of people, guests, government representatives, diplomatic representatives, and journalists from Moscow, Charkov, and other places attended the grand event. Special trains were opened to travel to the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, Chief Engineer Ventzel gave a speech reporting on the progress of the project. Then, Mr. Kalinin, chairman of the Workers' and Peasants' Government, gave a speech on behalf of the government, thanking the construction workers, engineers, and foreign experts for their cooperation in enabling the Soviet Russian construction plan to be completed on schedule. Mr. Kalinin immediately announced the resolution of the Workers' and Peasants' Government to name the power plant "Lenin Hydroelectric Power Plant." The crowd cheered and accepted. After Mr. Kalinin's speech, Mr. Chubar gave a speech on behalf of the Federal and Ukrainian governments on the relationship between the power plant and the development of new industries and the consolidation of the new regime. Then, Colonel Cooper, the chief consulting engineer from the United States, gave a speech praising the Russian government's perseverance and the boundless future of New Russia. Mr. Cooper also said that this construction was tantamount to training tens of thousands of engineers for New Russia, and its significance for the future was not limited to the completion of a large power plant. Among the guests who spoke was the world-renowned literary figure Henri Barbusse. Finally, Mr. Kalinin, on behalf of the government, awarded medals to a total of 67 people who had made special contributions to this project, including six foreign experts (namely, Chief Consultant Cooper, Engineer Faber, Engineer McFee, Chief Engineer Ventzel, Engineer Thompson, and Engineer Pindell), all of whom received the Order of the Red Banner. Colonel Cooper was given a certificate of merit by the Workers' and Peasants' Government for his special contributions. Among these 67 people, there were also two women. A monument to their merits was erected inside the plant, with the names of 16 people engraved on it, with Cooper at the head, and Ventzel and others included. On that day, the plant received thousands of congratulatory telegrams from home and abroad, including a telegram from the American Institute of Engineers in Newburgh. The joy of those involved in the project, the enthusiasm of the crowd, and the praise of the diplomatic representatives and journalists made the event a memorable one in history. In 1920, the famous British writer H.G. Wells visited Lenin in the Kremlin and published his impression that the new Russian leaders had many fantasies and that success was difficult. He was particularly critical of the electrification plan, saying that it would be difficult to succeed. Unexpectedly, it was completed on schedule. It is said that the Niagara Falls power plant in the United States can only supply 430,000 horsepower, and the largest Tennessee River hydroelectric plant in North America can only supply 620,000 horsepower, while the Dnieper plant can supply 810,000 horsepower, making it the world's largest hydroelectric power plant.</p>

<p>After the publication of the Lytton Report, the Moscow Weekly published a lengthy editorial attacking it as a "wonderful article of anti-China, anti-Russian, and anti-Japanese," combining the conflicts between imperialist countries and the hostility between imperialism and Soviet Russia. The editorial stated that the role of this document was not to solve world disputes or ensure peace, but to plunge the disputes into deeper waters, making the prospects for peace even more embarrassing. The editorial pointed out that this report had set a precedent in international disputes, allowing countries with aggressive intentions to act boldly in the future, while small and weak nations would be placed in an even more precarious position. This was tantamount to the League of Nations openly recognizing the legitimacy of aggression, and the League's facade of guaranteeing peace and sanctioning aggression had been completely exposed. The Lytton Report's attitude towards Manchuria as Chinese territory seemed to be one of recognition, but it was hesitant and full of reservations. The editorial did not spare any ridicule. The anti-Russian parts of the report were very obvious, but the author believed that this report was not only anti-China and anti-Russian, but also fully anti-Japanese. The League of Nations did not need to care about the interests of the Chinese, and it was bound to be hostile to Soviet Russia, but it also did not want the Japanese to swallow this piece of fat alone. Therefore, the international committee it proposed was intended to prevent Japan from swallowing it alone and to allow the imperialist powers to share the benefits. Therefore, the author believes that this document is consistent with the original nature of the League of Nations, and its significance is nothing more than expressing the conflicts between the imperialist countries themselves, the hostility towards Russia, and the oppression of small and weak nations. Its role is to add fuel to the fire, and the prospect of peace will soon be in crisis. On October 13, the newspaper Izvestia published an article by Radek, an expert on Eastern issues, commenting on the Lytton Report, saying that Japan's forceful occupation of Manchuria also had its "difficulties." It knew that it would be difficult to compete with the European and American imperialist powers by peacefully invading China, so it had to resort to rapid means. The Lytton Commission was not satisfied with this, so the report acknowledged that the establishment of Manchuria was purely the work of the Japanese, which clearly criticized their actions. Radek said that after the Manchurian Incident, the conflict between the United States and Japan had reached a point of intense excitement. Britain and France were trying their best to deal with Japan, wanting to use it as a vanguard to confront the United States. Since the United States wanted to achieve its goals, it could not but be on good terms with Britain and France. Therefore, the recent negotiations between Britain and France on the war debt issue have resumed, and this will be used as a condition for wooing and supporting Germany. However, according to Radek's observation, it is still uncertain whether the coordination between Britain and France and the United States can ultimately be realized, as there are many hidden reefs between them. Although Davis's recent trip to London and British Admiral Chatfield's trip to the United States can prove that they are continuing to work tirelessly, it is difficult to say that there have been significant results.</p>
<p>Among the countries neighboring Soviet Russia, Poland and Romania have been the most hostile to Soviet Russia and have been used by other countries to be eager to move against Russia. Poland has recently concluded a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, but negotiations between Soviet Russia and Romania have been going on for ten months, but have been interrupted repeatedly and have not yet produced any results. In July, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov planned to continue negotiations with Romanian representatives in Switzerland, but was unsuccessful. Afterwards, the mediation of Poland was resumed, but the points of disagreement between the two sides could not be coordinated. Soviet Russia wanted to retain its original attitude towards the unresolved issues between the two countries, while Romania firmly opposed this and was unwilling to include it in the treaty. Therefore, from Soviet Russia's perspective, Romania's attitude was tantamount to wanting Soviet Russia to recognize its occupation of Bessarabia under the guise of a non-aggression treaty. When Russia and Romania negotiated in Riga, they broke down because of this issue. Recently, when Litvinov went to Geneva in September, he said that Poland, through the mediation of the Polish ambassador to Romania, Katai, had gradually approached each other on the points of disagreement. After repeated negotiations in Switzerland, their views had become extremely close and were about to be signed. The next day, the Romanian representative suddenly claimed that the Romanian government could not agree and revoked all the agreed opinions, and then it was interrupted again. At present, the Romanian government has not made any other statement on this, so it seems that their views are still difficult to approach, and the issue of signing a treaty with Russia is feared that it will be difficult to realize for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Public in Geneva is Waiting Silently for Rain to Come <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Subtleties of the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Geneva Correspondence The 13th General Assembly of the League of Nations closed on October 17 in a spiritless mood. The Manchurian problem, which was watched by all eyes, was postponed for four weeks at the request of Japan. Alas, the League is nearing its end.</p>
<p>In the West, thirteen is considered unlucky. This session happened to coincide with the increasingly acute Sino-Japanese dispute, which almost shook the very foundation of the League. It seems that there is a destiny in the dark. In fact, the League has long become a League of Europe. It does not want to hear about this kind of East Asian problem from the bottom of its heart. However, China has already raised the issue and relies on it with all its might, so in order to maintain its appearance, it has no words to refuse. Moreover, many small and weak countries that are neighbors with strong countries are shuddering at Japan's undeclared war, which set a bad precedent after the European War. Therefore, representatives from countries such as Czechoslovakia and Spain shouted loudly in the Administrative Council, directly scolding Japan as a leader of rebels and urging the Chinese representative to propose Article 16 of the League Covenant to punish it. And it is said to people that we are not helping China but helping ourselves. If there is no league, we will not be able to sleep peacefully. The League's benefit is to turn big things into small things and small things into nothing, but they insist on expanding the scope and increasing the intensity. This makes the paper tiger that maintains world peace headache and helpless.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the Lytton Report, the world has welcomed it with great interest. Different countries have different positions, so the criticisms are extremely inconsistent. Britain and Germany have an ambiguous attitude and are neither here nor there. The United States sees Britain as a shift and hopes for joint action. Italy says that it is a huge work of perfunctory for both sides, and the result is still equal to zero. France says that the current situation is caused by internal chaos in China, which is unavoidable. Russia says that placing Manchuria under international co-management is tantamount to provoking it. From our perspective, the investigation by a third party proves that Japan's violation of all treaties is superficially not unfavorable to China, such as saying that (1) the pending cases that Japan has used as an excuse are not true; (2) the September 18th Incident was not Japan's self-defense; (3) all of Japan's actions were premeditated; (4) "Manchukuo" was forged by Japan and was not the intention of the Chinese people. The recommendations not only advocate that Japan withdraw its troops, but also withdraw all its troops along the South Manchurian Railway. Seeking the opposite of the wording has already clearly declared Japan's guilt, that is, it is aggression rather than self-defense, and it destroys China's territorial integrity rather than the intention of the people of Northeast China. What is regrettable is that after finding out that the responsibility for the September 18th Incident lies entirely with Japan, it is again induced by practical interests, hoping that it will compromise with China. The League of Nations had already ordered Japan to withdraw its troops long ago.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>There are brilliant proposals to be examined, but it is again advocated that neither China nor Japan should station troops in Northeast China, and that the international cooperation should be included in the transformation of China. All of this is self-contradictory and cannot be self-justified. The greatest key to thinking of this compromise solution in the situation where the force of aggression has become a matter of the moment is to center on the interests of the great powers themselves. Therefore, after careful deliberation of the report, it is found that it is concerned about the details. At present, it is using China's generosity to give Japan small favors, making the Northeast portal wide open, and not allowing one person to monopolize it. As a result, Japan will inevitably be trapped in a poor and isolated island, and it will be difficult to realize its dream of a continental policy. Therefore, if the suggestions are implemented one by one, it will be a lose-lose situation for China and Japan. Japan is determined to dominate East Asia and control the universe, and this kind of ambition will never be easily expressed in the future. Even the small favors obtained from China will be divided by the great powers. China will be at the mercy of others and lose its freedom, and there is no escape from the immediate loss. Alas, it is to be feared.</p>
<p>It is necessary to mention the recent situation in Europe. Germany's demand for military equality is tantamount to confronting France with an arrow, so the whereabouts of Davis and Herriot are the most noticeable. Is it a four-power meeting, a three-power meeting, Lausanne or The Hague? When I was writing this article, negotiations were still continuing. France wants to maintain its vested interests, so it is beneficial to maintain the covenant. Germany is the opposite. Although Britain is a mediator on the surface, the actual influence can be left to the United States. Japan's occupation of Manchuria clearly violates the open door policy. The United States wants to maintain the dignity of its Pacific policy, so it is happy to have the same guarantee as France. Therefore, if a turnaround can be obtained in the disarmament issue, Europe can temporarily get a small well-being and can divide its attention to East Asia. Japan may be able to restrain itself slightly under international supervision.</p>
<p>"All trees are silent, waiting for the rain to come." This is the recent situation in Geneva. The Japanese delegation has been led by Yosuke Matsuoka, who advocates the internationalization of Shanghai, and Isamu Yoshida, who accompanied the investigation team to Northeast China. Therefore, the saying that Japan will withdraw from the League is enough to prove that it is just empty talk and intimidation. At the same time, he hired an American, Bruwnson Rea, the chief writer of the Shanghai Far Eastern Times, to come here to promote it. One night, he entertained reporters from various countries and stated that he was a representative of "Manchukuo." The Americans scoffed at him, and a Chinese reporter directly rebuked him, saying, I know that what I represent is not "Manchukuo" but money. Rea was embarrassed and angry, so he turned off the lights and left. The Japanese have been using heavy money to win over reporters from various countries to help them spread rumors, and they have also published two books in English and French to slander China, one named "The Present Condition of China" and the other named "Relations of Japan with Manchuria and Mongolia," and distributed them to bookstores and newsstands for sale without taking any value. Other similar methods are too numerous to mention. The Chinese delegation, fearing that the world would be deceived by one-sided words, had no choice but to prepare several publications describing the Japanese national conditions and the truth of the military's arrogance, proving that it was not necessarily an organized country, and waited for the conference to distribute them. According to those who are familiar with the Japanese situation, the Japanese will definitely not accept the Lytton Report and will take delaying tactics and shirk their responsibility to China, saying, "Even if I accept the report, there is no one on the other side who can contact me. Does the government have this power?"</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation rented No. 18 Rue Charles Gallond as an office. Representative Yan Huiqing also lives in it. Other representatives and staff either live in hotels or apartments. The daily expenses are only enough to match the Japanese delegation's car expenses. In addition to Yan Huiqing as the chief representative at next month's conference, Gu Weijun and Guo Taiqi will also be added as representatives. Gu, who accompanied the investigation team to Northeast China, has been internally scheduled to attend the Executive Council first and explain the Northeast problem at any time. In addition, there are also Deputy Representative Luo Zongyi, Minister to Denmark, Jin Wensi, Minister to the Netherlands, Hu Shize, Representative to Switzerland, and Liang Long, Counselor of the Embassy in Germany. Special Committee Members Xu Shuxi, Professor of Yenching University, Wang Dazhen, Chief Writer of Diplomacy Monthly, Yan Deqing, Technical Supervisor of the Ministry of Railways, Qian Tai, Director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department, and Xia Jinlin, First Secretary of the Embassy in England, are assisting from the side.</p>
<p>Combining the opinions of most Chinese and foreign people, it is said that the Northeast problem was not caused in a short period of time, so it cannot be solved in one day. Hoping that the League will recover the lost land for China is nothing but idle talk on paper. Today, the only way out for China is to summon talented people to the capital to strengthen the government and take responsibility, and at the same time, to fully support the volunteer army and resist Japanese goods. There is no other good strategy than this. As the saying goes, heaven helps those who help themselves. Even if Japan is unrepentant or the League is willing to sacrifice to help, China must at least show that it has the ability to manipulate everything in the future. Therefore, we look forward to it not for diplomatic victory but for internal unity, and instead of hating foreigners for being unfair, we should cheer up and do some construction work to stop the mouths of those who curse. We should know that if there is no way to deal with internal affairs, there will be no way to deal with external affairs. (Geneva, October 15)</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Certain Friendly Nation Diplomat's Commentary on the Japanese Memorandum <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Minister Luo Will Also Draft a Refutation of the Declaration</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Commission's report on the September 18th Incident clarified that Japan's military actions were not in self-defense. The establishment of the puppet organization was also proven to be the result of Japanese military force and not the will of the people of the Northeast Three Provinces. Japan's violation of the League of Nations Covenant and all other conventions has been revealed to the world. Therefore, the Japanese side has vehemently opposed the report and produced a memorandum openly insulting our country, even claiming that our country has no unified government. This absurd and outrageous memorandum was submitted to the League of Nations on the 18th and its summary was released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a diplomat from a certain friendly nation who has resided in China for many years to inquire about his opinion on the Japanese memorandum. He provided a detailed response, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Japan's Forceful Arguments Seek to Conceal the Truth: The diplomat began by saying to the reporter that he had seen the summary of the memorandum released by Tokyo on the 18th regarding the Investigation Commission's report. He stated that its wording and intentions were extremely absurd. The purpose of the Japanese memorandum was to evade responsibility for the September 18th Incident, hoping to overturn the truthful and impartial record of the Manchurian Incident in the report. Furthermore, it attempted to insult China as a country without a unified government, even claiming that China is not a country but merely a geographical term. It sought to evade responsibility for violating international conventions and shift international opinion. However, the League of Nations has long been aware of this situation and has decided to deny the so-called "Manchukuo" based on the Lytton Report. Currently, Japan feels isolated in the international environment, and representatives of various countries in Geneva oppose the "Manchukuo" created single-handedly by Japan, as it hinders peace in the Far East. The Japanese memorandum only reveals its attempt to conceal the truth.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Insults the Entire Chinese Nation: The diplomat continued by saying that he has resided in China for a long time and is deeply aware that China's current situation is a phase in the process of construction. There is absolutely no country that can be denied its status as a country simply because it has some internal strife. The establishment of the National Government in Nanjing is a fact recognized by all nations of the world. The Japanese memorandum's claim that China has no unified government is a great insult to the entire Chinese nation. The reporter further inquired whether the Japanese memorandum's claim that Japan's bombing of Jinzhou was a legitimate action recognized by the Hague Convention was true, and whether the Hague Convention indeed permits military aggression as a legitimate action. The diplomat replied that any international convention is based on universal principles, in other words, international conventions are international justice. The reporter asked what the Japanese referred to as a legitimate action recognized by the Hague Convention. The diplomat laughed and replied that he did not know.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Minister Luo Will Draft a Declaration to Refute It: The reporter also learned that Foreign Minister Luo Wengan has decided to draft a declaration to refute the absurdity of the Japanese memorandum, which is currently being drafted and will be officially released soon.

<h3 id="e66">Two Lius Accuse Each Other of Victory <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Liu Xiang Cables Claiming Occupation of Fushun and Neijiang</p>
<p>▲ Liu Wenhui Cables Claiming Victory Over Enemy in Luzhou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Xiang, Commander of the 21st Army, launched a large-scale offensive with land, sea, and air forces against Luzhou. The 24th Army under Liu Wenhui, stationed in Luzhou, made every effort to resist, engaging in intense combat. In the past ten days, dozens of battles, large and small, have resulted in heavy losses on both sides. Liu Xiang's army suffered particularly heavy casualties during numerous attempts to cross the river, all of which were repelled. Liu Wenhui urgently ordered Yang Shangzhou and Tian Zhongyi's brigades to defend their positions and also dispatched Gao Ruming's brigade to reinforce them. Liu Xiang, realizing that Luzhou would not be easily captured, turned to attack Longtouguan, five miles from Luzhou. Meanwhile, he launched simultaneous offensives with heavy forces directly towards Neijiang and Fushun, with fierce fighting reported on all fronts. According to a cable from Chengdu on the 17th, the front lines remained unchanged, and the two sides were still in a stalemate. However, on the 18th, Liu Xiang cabled, claiming that both Neijiang and Fushun had been captured. The original telegram stated: 1) My Wang Zhiyi's troops occupied Neijiang at noon today. 2) Tang Shizun and Pan Wenhua's two divisions occupied Fushun today, and Xu Yaoqing's brigade occupied Ziliujing. 3) In the Luzhou area, Longtouguan has been occupied, and Liu Wenhui's retreat route has been cut off. Luzhou City can be expected to be captured within days. 4) Fierce fighting between Tian and Liu's armies is taking place near the Thatched Cottage and the Wuhou Temple near Chengdu. 5) Liu Wenhui's troops, disregarding their flanks, have been largely disarmed. The Sichuan war is expected to be resolved in the shortest possible time. According to those familiar with the Sichuan situation, Liu Wenhui's troops are very determined. Whether victory or defeat can be decided in a single day remains to be seen. We dare not lightly believe it without factual proof. However, while confronting Liu Xiang's army, Liu Wenhui still expressed his desire for peace. On the 9th, he telegraphed the central government and Chairman Chiang, requesting that they stop the arrogance and end the war. On the 15th, he telegraphed the National Government, the various ministries, and Chairman Chiang, reporting on the situation of the Chongqing army's advance, stating, "According to reports from Yang Shangzhou and Tian Zhongyi, brigade commanders in Luzhou, on the [date], the enemy army has been bombarding Luzhou City for days, using sulfur bombs to burn down civilian houses. Today, from midnight to noon, the infantry, in addition to the original six brigades, added two special forces regiments and five airplanes, along with one warship and five merchant ships, covered about sixty or seventy wooden boats to launch fierce attacks on three fronts, land, sea, and air, divided into dozens of teams to force a crossing, advancing one after another. Our army, with one against ten, fought bravely, resisting fiercely, making it the first fierce battle since the start of the war in Luzhou. When the enemy forced a crossing, our army calmly responded, waiting for half of them to land before concentrating a large force to sweep the landing enemy. Except for those killed, all were captured without exception. Two enemy ships and ten wooden boats were sunk, and three regimental commanders, Wu Shoushan, and three battalion commanders, Xu Shaoyan, etc., were killed. More than ten regimental, battalion, and company commanders were captured, and thousands of enemy officers and soldiers were drowned. More than 500 enemy rifles and more than ten machine guns were seized. As for the losses of our army, they will be reported separately after investigation. The most tragic thing is that when the airplane bombs fall, flesh and blood fly everywhere, and houses are reduced to ashes. The wounded and dead are innocent civilians, and the devastated are the essence of the land. Looking up to the south, our hearts are cut. According to a report from brigade commander Zhang Zhifang on the [date], the enemy in front of our brigade used machine guns and mortars last night to continuously fire on our river crossing points, but failed. Today, they continued to exchange fire. At 9:00 PM, airplanes dropped nine bombs, causing great damage to people and houses. It is said that the enemy who fought fiercely with our Huang regiment at Gaoshikan had nine regiments, and more than 700 have been killed or wounded. According to a telegram from the brigade commander on the [date], the enemy launched a fierce attack on our guard points at the river crossing points at 1:00 AM today, especially at the east, south, and north gates of Fucheng. Our officers and soldiers bravely resisted and the enemy made no progress. However, more than 40 enemy bombs fell in the city, killing and injuring more than 80 people, and destroying many civilian houses. Many enemies were killed or fell into the water. At 9:00 AM, the enemy again tried to force a crossing at Pipa Field and two fishing boats were sunk by our forces. The two sides are still fighting along the river. At 2:00 PM, enemy planes came to drop three bombs, causing fires in several places, and the people cried out in shock. The situation is extremely tragic, etc. After several fierce battles, the enemy has suffered heavy losses and has not succeeded. Luzhou and Fushun are still safe. Since noon yesterday, the situation on the front line has become calm. It is expected that the enemy's intention will not be easily abandoned. When reinforcements arrive, the battle will be even more fierce. It is unexpected that Liu Xiang would act so perversely. His brutality is no different from that of foreign invaders in our country. Your Excellency is concerned about the legacy of your children and must also feel deeply grieved and unwilling to sit idly by and let the land be devastated. You must take action as soon as possible. Furthermore, there is no change in the Qiongzhou area. Neijiang is still in Peimu Town, 30 miles from the city, and the two sides are firing across the river. Sincerely telegraphed, respectfully awaiting instructions. Liu Wenhui respectfully bowed and deleted the seals." (November 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Han Sends Zhang Yue to Wuhan to See Chiang <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ Liu's Troops to be Downsized in Jiaodong and Then Sent to Zhejiang</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaodong incident has been resolved, and the provincial troops have completed their withdrawal. Liu Zhennian's troops will also leave Shandong Province soon. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, had previously indicated that he would go to Nanjing and Wuhan to report to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang on the beginning and end of the Jiaodong incident and the difficulties of using troops. Now, due to being busy with affairs, he cannot spare the time, so he first sent Provincial Commissioner Zhang Yue. Zhang, carrying a personal letter from Han, left Jinan for Beijing this morning (17th) and will transfer to Wuhan. According to Han's remarks, Zhang Yue's mission to the south is roughly as follows: I originally intended to personally go to Wuhan to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on the Jiaodong incident. However, according to recent reports from various counties in Jiaodong, there are often remnants of Liu's troops forming gangs and becoming bandits. Moreover, after Liu's troops are transferred, a large-scale clearing of the countryside and post-war reconstruction must be carried out. I cannot leave for the time being, so I first sent Commissioner Zhang. As for the transfer of Liu Zhennian's troops, it is heard that the troops stationed in Laiyang have already set off today (17th) and will arrive in Yantai tomorrow. They will immediately board ships and leave Shandong. The problem of filling the defense of Jiaodong will have to wait until Liu's troops have completed their withdrawal before the provincial troops can arrange to fill the defense.</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian's 21st Division has been actively expanding in recent years, and its size is several times larger than that of a division, totaling nine infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, one artillery regiment, one engineer battalion, one transport battalion, two reserve infantry regiments, and one company each of the military officer training corps, special service, and military music corps. In addition, there is a machinery repair shop, with a total number of 31,000 people. Now, they have been ordered to be transferred to eastern Zhejiang and are about to set off. He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, sent a telegram to Xiong Bin in Jinan today (17th), stating that Liu's troops are too numerous and do not conform to the central government's organization. Please inform Liu to quickly downsize according to the central government's regulations into a Class B division (i.e., each division has two brigades, and each brigade has three regiments). The central government had already ordered the abolition of the military officer training corps, which must be disbanded as soon as possible. Most of the soldiers under his command are from Jiaodong. They should be discharged in Jiaodong, retaining the strong and eliminating the weak, and actively downsize before boarding the ship to avoid the trouble of downsizing and transporting them back and forth after arriving in eastern Zhejiang. In the future, they will receive their salaries on a monthly basis and diligently train them to serve the country. Shortly after this telegram arrived, another telegram was received from He Yingqin, informing that he had received Liu Zhennian's telegram reporting the order of departure. Director Wang Jinglu also sent a cold telegram to Xiong, informing him that twelve ships had been hired to transport Liu Zhennian's troops. Because the tides in Yantai are rough, except for the ships berthed at the pier, the rest must anchor seventy miles outside the port at Grandma Mountain. All ships must leave to avoid prolonged anchoring and lack of coal and fresh water. Xian's telegram also reported that the Shengan Wheel had departed at [time], the Xinfeng Wheel had departed at [time], and the Shihe Wheel was not repaired and another ship must be hired to transport them. In addition, Fu Xingpei, sent by Zhang Xueliang to Yexian, also sent a telegram to Xiong reporting that order had been restored after arriving in Yexian. Soon after, there was another telegram reporting the order of departure of Liu's troops. Liu Zhennian himself telegraphed Xiong Bin from Laiyang, welcoming him to Yexian and stating that there was no definite date for his return to Yexian and that he would telegraph again after the date was set. As for the date of Xiong's departure to Yexian, it has been set for the 18th, and he will meet with Liu Zhennian in Yexian. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Japanese Ships Illegally Fishing in Our Territorial Waters <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Consul Ingeniously Claims it Was to Avoid Wind and Waves</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Japanese fishing boats often openly fish in the territorial waters of Shandong Province. The Department of Industry had previously sent a letter to Nishi, the Japanese Consul in Jinan, requesting that he stop this. Recently, a letter was received from him with extremely clever wording, stating, "Respectfully, regarding the matter of Japanese fishing boats fishing near Sangdao Island in Huangxian County, I was instructed to find a way to stop it. I replied to your department on August 8th with the Hua Shi No. 6 official letter stating that the county is under the jurisdiction of the Zhifu Consul and I have informed the relevant authorities. Now, according to a letter from the Acting Consul of Zhifu, the ship belongs to the Kwantung Governor-General and is ordered to conduct investigations in the territorial waters. As for the fishing, it was not the [ship name] but the Hiruko Maru. According to the captain, the ship temporarily anchored in the territorial waters due to wind and waves, but the operation was actually outside the territorial waters and it is about to return home. At that time, I instructed them not to fish within Chinese territorial waters and the ship should comply with this. This is for your reference. Sincerely, Nishi Koichi, Japanese Consul to Shandong Department of Industry Director Wang Zaiji."</p>

The plaintiff was the wife of Yin Shisheng, former Chief of the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, who moved to Songjiang after leaving office. She had a long-standing and close relationship with Chief Shen. After more than a month of mediation by friends, both sides forgave each other. Yesterday, the Shanghai court sent a subpoena to Songjiang. The plaintiff, Yin Shiyaxiong, immediately submitted a request to the County Procuratorate to withdraw the lawsuit. It is heard that the Procuratorate has forwarded a letter to the Shanghai court for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>▲ County Party Committee Member Returns Home Safely: Yao Xinshun, a member of the Executive Committee of the Wuxi County Party Committee, went to Shanghai with his wife a month ago for some matters. After living there for only two days, he suddenly disappeared. Although he was searched for everywhere, there was no trace of him. His family was extremely anxious. A few days ago, there was suddenly a clue that Yao was in Shanghai. His family rushed to find him and he returned home safely the day before yesterday, but he was mentally exhausted and acted passively. He immediately telegraphed the Provincial Party Committee requesting his resignation. He received a reply yesterday, retaining him and granting him two weeks of leave.</p>
<p>▲ Water Police District Strictly Guarding Against Lake Bandits: The Water Police District No. 2 in Wuxi, given that the Taihu Lake bandits have been rampant all year round, and now that it is winter, the bandits are thinking of moving again, has ordered strict precautions. It has also ordered the Bao Su and Xun Ping ships to depart immediately to patrol the lake surface.

<p>▲ Three Fires Broke Out in the City and Countryside in One Day: In the monk's residence of the Puxian North Courtyard, next to the Xiongdi Photography Shop on Gongyuan Road in the city, a fire suddenly broke out at 11:30 PM on the 18th, causing a conflagration. The flames were so bright that they could not be approached. At that time, the abbot of the temple, Hongda, the monk Rongpei, and the old woman who cooked the incense and rice, were all awakened from their dreams and fled in panic, grabbing cotton quilts to avoid danger. Fortunately, the fire brigades of each section heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour, the fire was extinguished, but three ordinary houses had been reduced to ashes. Also, a fire broke out in a pheasant nest of the Zhang family near the Second Branch Bureau outside Guangfu Gate at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, resulting in the burning of an empty house. Furthermore, a fire alarm was reported at the Dalong Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant in Xintangqiao, the Second District (Jingyun City), at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday. The fire brigades of Jiangxiqiao and Yangting successively drew water to extinguish the fire, resulting in losses of more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Election Fraud Causing Disputes: During the re-election of the Township Chief and Supervisor in Dagang Township, outside Nanmen, on August 26th of this year, citizen Pu Shuying believed it to be illegal and immediately convened a township meeting, causing conflicts with Qiu Boying and others. The election was inconclusive. Afterwards, Pu filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the County Court, accusing Qiu Boying of assault and accusing Qian Zhongliang, the Chief of the First District, of instigating assault. Qiu Boying also filed a complaint with the Procuratorate against Pu Shuying for disrupting the election, and Chief Qian also hired a lawyer to draft a counterclaim to the Criminal Court, requesting that Pu be prosecuted for false accusation. Yesterday was the date for the court hearing. At 5:00 PM, Judge Liang opened the court to interrogate. The defendants Pu Shuying, Qiu Boying, Qian Zhongliang, and the witnesses Xu Zonglian, Li Jianlie, Zhu Guangzu, Gu Ziwen, Wang Rongchun, and the defense lawyers Tang Ying and Deng Shuren were present. First, Pu Shuying was interrogated, stating that in August, because the villagers were dissatisfied with the illegal election, Qiu Boying assaulted him and Chief Qian incited the assault. He requested that they be punished according to the law. Next, Qiu Boying stated that the assault claimed by Pu was fabricated, and Qian also stated that Pu's accusation was completely false. After reviewing the statements, Judge Liang advised them to withdraw the private prosecution in court. Pu insisted on refusing, so the lawyers for both parties stood up to argue. After the debate, Judge Liang announced the end of the debate and set a date for sentencing on the 22nd of this month. The plaintiff, Pu Shuying, was released on bail and the others were ordered to return home.</p>
<p>▲ Appeal for the Levy of Donations for Ship Registration: The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau has recently sent personnel to Wuxi to organize a registration office. Every day, three or four people in plain clothes and suits hire small boats and intercept passing ships at the inner river checkpoints and old tax collection points in the north and south ponds near the city, claiming to be inspectors, ordering them to register and demanding a registration fee of 11.6 yuan, divided into numerous items such as licenses, measurements, and nationality registration. Even small ships cannot be exempted. However, ship owners believe that the original intention of the Maritime Affairs Bureau was not to collect donations, but to maintain maritime administration and protect foreign interests. Now that it has added various fees, the ships that have to pass through the customs to travel on the Yangtze River and sea already feel that it violates the original intention. How can it impose huge donations on the inner river ships? Therefore, they have requested the shipping industry association to assist them. The association believes that there may be regulations for ship registration, but precautions should be taken against malpractices at the beginning of implementation. Recently, the waterways have been unstable and ships have often encountered bandits and robberies on the way. After being robbed by treacherous people, they set up checkpoints and collect fees. Furthermore, the inner river sailing ships are small businesses, and the inner river steamships have already registered according to regulations. If they are forced to register again, they should issue an order to the ship owners to register themselves, and should not intercept them on the way for inspection. Therefore, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Industry, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Department of Industry, and the Department of Construction, requesting assistance to abolish all ship registration offices everywhere.</p>

The chamber believes that Ningbo is a commercial port and there is no need to garrison a large army. Moreover, the current number of military police in Ningbo is sufficient to maintain law and order. Therefore, it convened an emergency meeting at the chamber at 3:00 PM yesterday and decided to telegraph Chairman Chiang in Wuhan requesting that Liu's troops be transferred to other places to comply with public opinion. On the other hand, it telegraphed the Ningbo Association of Fellow Provincials in Shanghai urging them to unanimously advocate this.</p>
<p>▲ Bride Commits Suicide by Throwing Herself into a Well: Wang Yangding, a wealthy gentleman in Fangqiao Yao Youyuan, Yuyao, moved to the city because of bandits in his hometown. His youngest daughter, Zhaoqin, is 20 years old and studied at the County No. 3 Elementary School. She was betrothed to Shen Qi, the fifth son of Gao Jinchun, a wealthy gentleman in the coastal area of the same county. Zhaoqin was very opposed to this at the time. In August of this year, she once attempted to cut her throat with a knife, but was cured. Wang Yangding thought that his daughter had repeatedly attempted suicide and that marrying her off might solve the problem. Therefore, he suggested this to the Gao family. The Gao family chose October 11th as the wedding date at the Jiang family in the city. On the 28th of the same month, she moved to the Gao family's main residence on the coast. Unexpectedly, Zhaoqin felt uncomfortable after getting married. She asked her parents-in-law to return to Ningbo and came to her parents' home in the city with her husband, Shen Qi, for several days. She went back with her husband. Unexpectedly, the woman wanted to return to Ningbo again within two days. Although her parents-in-law did not allow it, the woman was very determined. It happened that Xiang Lusheng, the manager of Yuanda Village in the city, went to the Gao family for something. The woman asked to go with Xiang. Her parents-in-law reluctantly agreed. The day before yesterday, she hired a boat and came to the city with him. After landing, Xiang went to urinate and the woman went ahead. When Xiang arrived at the Wang family, he did not see the woman. He asked the family and they did not know. He went out to look for her and found her body in the well at the back door of the Wang residence. She had already died when she was pulled out.</p>

<p>▲ Confiscated Opium Burned in Large Quantities: Since Chiang Dingwen, Commander of the Second Army of the Army and Commander of the Bengbu Garrison, was stationed here, he has been extremely serious about banning opium. In the past two months, the Bengbu Military Police Inspection Office, directly under the Garrison Headquarters, has successively seized 84 packages of heroin raw materials, weighing about 2,000 taels, 500-600 taels of opium, and more than 400 pieces of opium paraphernalia. Chiang believed that opium and drugs were contraband that harmed society. He specifically ordered the Military Law Office and the Adjutant Office of the Garrison Headquarters to publicly burn them on Mount Bengbu on a set date and notified various agencies to send representatives to the scene to supervise the burning. At 7:00 AM on the 17th, Guo Qiang, Director of the Adjutant Office of the Garrison Headquarters, and Zhang Xiechen, a military judge, sent people to transport the large quantities of opium, drugs, and opium paraphernalia to Mount Bengbu and set them on fire.</p>

<h3 id="e81">New Minister of Education, Weng Wenhao, Firmly Declines <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Difficulties and Challenges in the Education Sector</p>
<p>Requests Song Ziwen to Appoint Someone Else</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch – The new Minister of Education, Weng Wenhao, is still in Beiping, holding the position of Director of the Geological Survey Institute. He has repeatedly declined the position of Minister, but the Central Government has not approved it. Today (16th), it was widely rumored in Beiping and Tianjin that Weng had agreed to take the position of Minister and would go to the capital soon to take office. The reporter went to Weng's private residence to inquire about the truth. He agreed to be interviewed, and the key points of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Weng Wenhao stated that his previous trip to Nanjing was not specifically to resign from the position of Minister of Education, but he took the opportunity to make this request. Before returning to Beiping, he had discussed it with the President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen. Today, President Song sent a telegram again asking him to take the position of Minister of Education, but he still firmly declined. The rumor that he would go to the capital to take office is not true. He is very interested in studying geology and is unwilling to take on educational administrative affairs. In the past, the Ministry of Education appointed him as the President of Tsinghua University, but he also declined. This proves that he is unwilling to handle educational administration. Based on this principle, he resolutely declines the position of Minister. The Ministry of Education is still temporarily headed by Minister Zhu (Jiahua), with the assistance of Vice Ministers Duan (Xipeng) and Qian (Changzhao). Since he is unwilling to do it, he has already sent a telegram to President Song, asking him to appoint someone else. He believes that the Ministry of Education has many difficult problems. First, the most difficult problem is funding. There is a shortage of educational funding nationwide, and it is difficult to handle the annual increase in school classes, and there is no way to expand. For example, the Beiping University Medical College has been changed to a six-year system, but the funding for the reform has not been secured. The Russian-French Law College has been reorganized into a Business College, but the funding for expanding the facilities has not been allocated. Other universities have similar situations. Second, the situation in the education sector is complicated. Recently, there have been rumors of changes in the organization of Normal Universities. He thinks that this matter may not be implemented. The various outstanding cases of Beiping University and the reorganization of Normal University have not been considered yet because he is unwilling to head the Ministry of Education (Weng smiled at the reporter when he said this). Chairman Jiang (Zhongzheng) is very concerned about education, but he is currently traveling around and may not have time to take care of the selection of the Minister of Education. He originally wanted to go to the capital, but to avoid suspicion, he will not go now. The rumor that he will be appointed as the Minister of Education after the Third Plenary Session is not true. If the Third Plenary Session announces that he is the Minister, he will firmly decline.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Song Ziwen: Mr. Weng received a telegram from Song Ziwen, the acting President of the Executive Yuan, today, urging him to stay. He personally drafted a reply telegram on the same day, requesting that someone else be appointed. The original telegram is recorded below: "To His Excellency Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: I have earnestly stated before that I am truly incapable and that it is difficult to leave the geological work suddenly. Please consider my foolishness and approve it, and appoint someone else to avoid a vacancy. Weng Wenhao, respectfully, November 16th."</p>
<h3 id="e82">Gu Shusen Meets with Representatives of Middle Schools in Beiping <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th – Representatives of middle schools in Beiping, including Li Jinghan, went to the capital of education on the 19th to urge the allocation of funds.

<h3 id="e84">Ministry of Education Promulgates Curriculum Standards for Kindergartens and Elementary Schools (3) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>(6) Quiet Time</p>
<p>I. Objectives: (A) Directly satisfying mental health; (B) Indirectly increasing the efficiency of mental activities.</p>
<p>II. Content: (A) Silence: Following the Montessori method, timed silences are held. After hearing a certain sound signal (either a bell or a certain tone), everyone must sit upright. The teacher guides the child on duty to take the silence sign (gray with black letters) and put it next to the blackboard, while observing whether there are any children who are not silent. After everyone is quiet, everyone is told to close their eyes. At this time, (a) either clasp hands and droop their heads for support and rest; (b) or lean on the table and lie down; (c) or sleep on the table. The teacher retreats to a corner. After two or three minutes, another sound signal is made to make everyone look up. The sound signal can also be changed after a month or two, sometimes with a playful meaning. The time can be gradually increased. For example, after the teacher leaves the room and everyone is quiet, she goes to another room and calls a child's name in a pleasant voice after two or three minutes. The child who is called will run to her arms like a flying swallow. Then, another child's name is called, and so on until everyone has left. This game can be called "Flying Swallows Returning to Their Nests." Beforehand, the children can be told that quiet time in the Montessori kindergarten is held more than once a day, with around 10 o'clock (after eating snacks for those who eat snacks) being the most suitable. (B) Quiet Resting: For those who have a full-day system, it is best to prepare bedding for each child. After lunch, they retire for quiet resting. Small children should sleep for more than two hours, and older children should sleep for one and a half hours. Others should not be disturbed when they wake up. (Note: New-style kindergartens in England pay great attention to this point.)</p>
<p>(7) Snacks</p>
<p>I. Objectives: (A) Meeting Needs: Children have small appetites, so the distance between eating times must be short. From breakfast to noon, there are five hours, and a small amount of biscuits and other snacks are needed in between to satisfy hunger. (B) Practicing proper etiquette during eating. (C) Developing proper hygiene habits during eating. (D) Developing the habit of cherishing food.</p>
<p>II. Content: Around 10:00 every morning, each child eats appropriate food (yams, biscuits, etc.) and drinks a cup of boiled water (those with ample funds can use milk instead of water or eat a small amount of fruit).</p>
<p>III. Key Points of Educational Methods</p>
<p>(1) The various activities listed above (music, games, stories and nursery rhymes, social nature, work, etc.) should be integrated into one when actually implemented, without so-called subjects. The method of integrating into one should be based on a kind of needed material (seasonal, such as the tree planting festival in March, the National Day in October, the red leaves in autumn, the white snow in winter, etc., discovered in the environment, such as making a birthday for a doll, burying a dead beneficial bird publicly, holding a parents' meeting, etc.) as the center of the operation for a day or two or three days. All activities are inseparable from the scope of this center.</p>
<p>(2) The time that young children spend in the kindergarten every day is about six hours for the whole day. Kindergartens with special circumstances in the city can use a half-day system, about three hours every morning. In addition to scheduled snacks, quiet rest, and stopping work for lunch and scheduled quiet rest in the whole-day system, various activities should not be rigidly divided into sections (such as what kind of homework should be taught every hour). However, the teacher should have a plan in mind, leading the children to do light activities after heavy work, leading the children to do outdoor exercises after working at the table, and may intersperse a few minutes of rest after a certain activity to adjust the children's physical and mental health.</p>
<p>(3) Various homework can be done by children freely from their own interests, but group homework should also be done once a day. The teacher uses suggestive methods to attract children to operate together. If a small number of children do not want to participate in group homework, there is no need to force them.</p>
<p>(4) Stories, games, music, society and nature can mostly be guided by the teacher to implement group homework, while work should mostly be done by children individually, with individual guidance from the teacher. These activities can divide all homework into several items (such as drawing, cutting and pasting, building blocks, etc.) for children to cooperate in groups and divide the work, but attention should be paid to two things: First, grouping two or three people into a group to cooperate in one thing is the most effective. Second, children often do not finish this thing and then go to do that thing, or give up halfway, or do it perfunctorily. The teacher should train them to have a sense of responsibility. The training method can be to use symbols to show which ones can be completed and give them reward symbols, otherwise give them warning symbols, or express goodwill to those who have completed them and indifference to those who have not completed them.</p>
<p>(5) The teacher should be fully prepared to avoid temporary difficulties. The matters to be prepared should be determined according to the trend of children's activities. For example, before the National Day commemoration activity, the teacher should collect materials and prepare skills for how many problems and facts are expected to occur in the children's National Day commemoration activity, so as to cope with them.</p>
<p>(6) The materials presented by the teacher to guide children's activities and the methods of guiding children's activities, as well as all progress, must consider children's psychology and be in line with children's experiences.</p>
<p>(7) The materials used in early childhood education are not empty words, but real objects and facts that can be seen and touched daily, or at least imagined. The places used in early childhood education are not limited to indoors, but must take outdoor nature, family, village, city, industry and commerce as the best places for activities.</p>
<p>(8) Kindergarten design teaching must pay attention to the following points: First, discover design topics from children's free activities. For example, a child plants cabbage in the sandbox. After the teacher discovers it, he can gather many children to design planting vegetables. This is a good opportunity in design teaching and should be used. Second, all activities that should be in the design should have long considered the children's ability to remove the parts that children cannot do or cannot do well to avoid children abandoning because they cannot do or being frustrated because of failure in the middle. Third, the design materials should be easy to achieve the purpose and easy to get results. In a design, it must be divided into many small paragraphs, each small paragraph has a small purpose and can get a small result, then children will do it according to it, and it will naturally be interested to reach the purpose and get results and be willing to work hard. If the whole design is done halfway and the interest of most children has shifted, then the teacher can also put down this design and then engage in the design where the interest of most children lies, and then find a way to continue when the appropriate time comes.</p>
<p>(9) The teacher is the helmsman in the children's activities, and he must make the children follow his trend to proceed. Before reaching the goal, do not change the purpose, and the suggestions issued should also be consistent and not mixed. When the children have reacted but have not reached completion, there must be no new suggestions.</p>
<p>(10) The teacher is the final judge. The children's problems should be solved by the children themselves. Only when the children really cannot solve it can the teacher inspire and guide them from the side.</p>
<p>(11) The teacher should use rewards to encourage children's interest in certain homework. Rewards for young children are most effective with verbal and toy gifts, followed by symbol rewards. The rewards should pay attention to: First, rewards should not be used frequently, otherwise they will be abused and lose their effectiveness. Second, it is of course right to reward those who excel in the crowd, but also to reward individuals who have made sudden progress in comparison before and after.</p>
<p>(12) There are several skills that should be made proficient by children by using the "practice" method. The conditions that must be taken care of in practice are as follows: First, the time should be short to maintain children's interest and attention in practice. Second, the number of times should be in line with the principle of distributed practice (at the beginning, practice quickly in a certain short time every day, and then practice intermittently after being familiar with it, and only stop after being proficient). Third, the materials used for practice must be estimated to have real value, and do not waste effort if it is not necessary to practice. Fourth, the method of practice must be checked to see if it is the most excellent, and it is certain that it will be laborious and useless if the method is misused (for example, practicing abstract symbols instead of using real objects). Fifth, when practicing, not only should we pay attention to the children's performance, but also to whether the methods used by the children are appropriate or not. If they are inappropriate, they must be corrected at any time.</p>
<p>(13) A "physical examination" should be held every six months, a "height and weight examination" should be held every month, and a "health and cleanliness examination" should be held every day (the details are in the curriculum standards for elementary school hygiene and other subjects). The teacher should try to remedy the physical defects and various diseases of the children. The teacher should not only have the intelligence of a mother and teacher, but also have the skills of a nurse and the common sense of treating diseases.</p>
<p>(14) The teacher should pay attention to the children's body, temperament, hobbies, as well as family and environment. It is best to prepare a small booklet to record the observations as materials for research and teaching.</p>
<p>(15) The teacher should often go to the children's homes or invite parents to the kindergarten to try to connect feelings and promote the methods of early childhood education and family education.</p>
<p>(16) In addition to using outdoor nature and society, kindergartens should equip everything according to the following standards: First, it must conform to the national character of our country. The national character of our country is sincerity, perseverance, and different from Europe, America, and Japan. The equipment of kindergartens does not need to be too gorgeous, but must pay attention to solidity. It does not need to take too many foreign styles and imported goods, but must be as Chinese as possible. Second, it must conform to the local social situation. Our country has a vast territory, and the social situations of cities, villages, south, north soil, rich areas, and barren areas are different. The equipment of kindergartens should take more common items in the local area and not be separated from the actual situation of the society. Third, it must meet the needs of children. It is necessary to consider the children's physiological condition, psychological state, and living situation and equip them according to their needs. (A) The quantity should not be too simple, and it is expected to be enough. (B) The quality should be convenient for children to apply. Fourth, it must not violate the meaning of education. On the positive side, it should be (A) able to develop children's creativity and stimulate children's imagination; (B) can be used by children themselves and can be installed or disassembled by themselves; (C) can arouse children's interest and aesthetic sense; (D) can arouse children's emotions; (E) can develop children's intelligence; (F) is beneficial to children's body. On the negative side, it should be (A) Unhygienic ones are not taken. (B) Dangerous ones are not taken. (C) Children are not interested in them. (D) Ones that damage the beauty are not taken. Fifth, it is necessary to use waste materials, natural materials and daily necessities. Waste materials such as old books, old newspapers, rags, useless glass pieces, glass bottles, cloth pieces, broken bowls, natural materials such as fruit pits, leaves, petals, seeds, clam shells, shells, bird feathers, pebbles, daily necessities such as soap, candles, etc. can be used to make educational supplies, decorations, and homework materials, etc. This not only saves money, but also inspires children's creativity.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 18th – The Ministry of Education on the 19th ordered all education bureaus to issue the 20th year Social Education General Survey Statistical Form, requesting that all social education matters to be reported be compiled and reported before the end of February of the 22nd year.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Jiangsu Province's Circular Prohibiting Students from Fundraising <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, the Director of the Jiangsu Education Bureau, in view of the fact that students often engage in fundraising activities, which wastes their studies and causes social misunderstandings and numerous malpractices, which has a profound impact on the future of education, specially issued a circular to all levels of schools under his jurisdiction to prohibit them. He also proposed that the provincial government conference issue a circular to all counties to announce the prohibition. It has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>When the Director of this Bureau attended the meeting of primary school principals in Wuxian County this month on the 14th, he was surprised to hear that students in public and private middle schools in Wuxian County had stopped classes to go out and fundraise. He was deeply surprised. He then patrolled the city and saw male and female students all over the streets and alleys, either blocking vehicles and cutting off traffic, or breaking into people's homes and destroying tranquility to fundraise. If fundraising was not successful, they would often utter bad words, causing passers-by to look at them, society to be uneasy, the people to be angry and resentful, and the market to be suspicious. What is even more painful is that young girls lingered on the streets, and gangsters took the opportunity to make fun of them and be frivolous. The dignity of the school was swept away, and social ethics were destroyed. All kinds of situations were witnessed by the Director of this Bureau. The loss of stopping classes and the gains of fundraising are obviously very different. Sacrificing the precious time of thousands of students to gain a drop of fundraising is already a loss. Moreover, there are numerous malpractices and people are talking about it. It is even more heart-wrenching. What is the purpose of the principals? They only rely on the resolutions of student groups to let them stop classes freely without discouraging them, which is a dereliction of duty. If this trend is not corrected quickly, it will have a profound impact on the future of education. This special circular is issued to all principals, requesting them to repeatedly explain the pros and cons of stopping classes and fundraising to the students and to strictly prohibit them. Do not have any worries or be perfunctory. The Director of this Bureau will never sit idly by and watch the young people who are the future masters of the country indulge in the false name of patriotism, waste their own studies, ruin their social faith, and move towards suicide. In addition to proposing that the provincial government conference issue a circular to all counties to announce the prohibition, if there are any such incidents, they should be forcibly dispersed with real force. In addition to separate orders, this urgent order is issued to the directors of the bureaus, requesting them to forward it to all schools under their jurisdiction for compliance.</p>

<p>▲ Alumni Associations of Graduates from Central University, Dongda University, and Nanga University Host Journalists</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th – On the afternoon of the 9th, the General Association of Alumni of Graduates from Central University, Dongda University, and Nanga University hosted reporters to request the government to restore the Business and Medical Colleges. Fu Yulin and Xiao Yanbin successively reported the reasons for requesting the government to restore the colleges: 1. To complete the organization of the National University; 2. After the Business and Medical Colleges are independent, they will deprive the entire funding of Central University and increase the burden on students, hindering the advancement of poor children; 3. The Business and Medical Colleges are located in Shanghai, and the transportation between Shanghai and Nanjing is convenient, so there is no difficulty in management; 4. The pre-medical course is attached to the College of Science. After the separation, these students have nowhere to go, and the facilities of the College of Science are better and research is more convenient. Finally, the alumni who have graduated and are still in school unanimously advocate the restoration of the colleges and will not stop until the goal is achieved. The first step is to arouse the sympathy of the public opinion circles, the second step is to ask the party and state elders for assistance, and the third step is to petition the Third Plenary Session.</p>

<p>▲ First Place Individual, Da Xia’s Chen Zhiyuan, Time 17 Minutes, 54.6 Seconds</p>
<p>The Middle School Athletic Advancement Association of Shanghai held the middle school cross-country competition yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Kwang Hua Middle School attached to the university on the Great Western Road. Fourteen schools registered to participate. McLaren Middle School was absent due to circumstances, so thirteen schools with a total of sixty-five participants actually attended. Kwang Hua Middle School attached to the university won the championship with eighteen points. Pudong came in second, and Qingxin came in third. The first place individual was Chen Zhiyuan from Da Xia. Liu Chongli from Kwang Hua came in second by a narrow margin. Zhan Yiji from Kwang Hua came in third with a time of seventeen minutes, fifty-four and six-tenths seconds. It is truly remarkable that middle school students can run such a time in the three-and-a-half mile race. Recalling the cross-country race held by Jiangnan University at Kwang Hua in 1928, the best time was eighteen minutes and forty-four seconds by Wang Zishao of Kwang Hua. The fact that middle school students can now surpass the achievements of university students in the same course demonstrates the hard work and effective promotion of practice in various schools in recent years. The following is a brief description of the competition at that time.</p>
<p>▲Struggling Along the Way</p>
<p>At exactly 2:00 PM, the athletes from various schools eagerly entered the field in a light breeze and drizzle. After Chen Yuze, the starter, briefly explained the rules, he fired the starting gun. The participants formed a long line, like a snake, along the route. From the Great Western Road through Avenue Foch and Route Hobbema, veteran and new competitors were scattered. When they reached Lincoln Avenue, Liu Chongli from Kwang Hua was leading the pack, running swiftly. Following Liu were Chen Zhiyuan from Da Xia and Zhan Yiji from Kwang Hua. The others also chased hard with all their strength. As they approached the finish line, Chen and Liu gritted their teeth, fighting for the lead, but Chen Zhiyuan from Da Xia ultimately surpassed Liu Chongli by a shoulder's length to take first place. All sixty others also reached the finish line within twenty-five minutes, demonstrating a commendable spirit of perseverance.</p>
<p>▲Grand Award Ceremony</p>
<p>After the race, the athletes from all the schools gathered in the Kwang Hua assembly hall, enjoying tea and refreshments in a lively and grand atmosphere. Then, Mr. Zheng Xigu, the chairman of the Middle School Athletic Advancement Association, took the stage to give a speech, encouraging the athletes to save the country through physical education. He also introduced Mr. Liao Maoru to present the awards. After Mr. Liao announced the results of the competition, the audience erupted in applause and congratulated each other. Prizes were awarded to the top five teams and the top ten individuals. The results are listed below.</p>

<p>Kiangnan has lost, defeated by the strong team, Westerners Police. The Westerners Police are not as strong as in previous years, yet Kiangnan was defeated, which shows their relative strength. Some say that Kiangnan’s players have an indomitable spirit, and that yesterday’s defeat may prove to be an effective stimulant. We will wait and see. Yesterday was a match in the Westerners Association First Division League. Westerners Police won with a score of 5-2. The two teams’ lineups were as follows:</p>

<p>Kiangnan kicked off, circling the opponent's mid-field. Their momentum was formidable. Chen Zhenhe headed the ball to the left, and Liu Zukan met it in the center. The situation became tense. Goalkeeper Aitman caught the ball with both hands, averting the danger. Xu Yahui intercepted halfway and led the attack again, forcing a corner kick, but ultimately without success. Although Kiangnan held the advantage, their forwards did not coordinate well, often missing opportunities at crucial moments. Chen Zhenhe was left to assist alone, making it difficult to achieve any special results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Zhuang Shihong injured his ankle but continued to play, though his agility was reduced. The opposing players invaded everywhere. Right inside forward Jack scored with a long shot from about thirty yards from the goal. A good defender might have prevented this. The second goal was scored by center-back Gaxu from a free kick, precisely and beautifully into the top left corner, as if his foot had eyes. Okley scored the third goal after Wei Jinsheng kicked a corner kick. Amidst a crowd of players, one strike was all it took. Kiangnan was not weak. After each goal conceded, they launched a fierce counterattack, but the result was always zero because they could not tighten up in time. In the first half, they lost momentum and conceded three goals.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Morale Boosted After the Break <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>After the break, the two armies realigned and fought again. Kiangnan returned to their original form, striving to achieve. Xu Yahui had a chance with a penalty kick, heading straight for the enemy's goal. Chen Zhenxiang rushed forward, but the ball had already turned back, and Chen was offside. At that time, Kiangnan was on the attack, and Okley advanced swiftly on the flank. Jiang and Gu resisted poorly, and the ball went to the center, where new player Poke took advantage and scored, taking a 4-0 lead. Kiangnan launched another attack. Liu Zukan kicked a corner kick. After three or four passes, it hit an enemy's arm. Chen Zhenhe himself scored the penalty kick. He kicked with force, but the goalkeeper caught it. The whistle blew, saying that the kick had to be taken again because a Westerners Police inside back had entered the penalty area at the same time as Chen, which was against the rules. The second time, Chen kicked the ball just inside the post, and the score was opened. Kiangnan's morale was boosted. Liu picked up the ball and passed to the goalkeeper, who caught it. Chen Zhenhe swooped down like a heavenly general, his body colliding with the goalkeeper. Chen touched the ball in the air with his foot. Chen's bravery and divine power were universally praised.</p>
<h3 id="e106">▲Ambushed Again Before the End <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Kiangnan scored two goals in a row, and hope suddenly arose. Liu had two more chances, but his measures were inappropriate, otherwise, another situation could have occurred. After thirty minutes, He Lei sent a long ball, and Poke happened to be there, heading it into the goal. The result was 5-2. Kiangnan's hope of winning was dashed. After that, there was nothing but back and forth play, without any further scores. Kiangnan ultimately lost 2-5. The referee was Reynolds.</p>

<p>▲Two A and B League Games Today</p>
<p>In last night's women's basketball A League game between Kiangnan and East Asia, East Asia was consistently at a disadvantage, often trailing by three or four points. However, in the last eight minutes, East Asia's morale soared, and Kiangnan faltered. As a result, East Asia turned defeat into victory, defeating Kiangnan with a score of 32 to 29. In the B League, Shanghai Middle School was completely shut out, failing to score. The Southeast B team won 42-0. Chongde won over Liangjiang B with a score of 36-10.</p>
<p>▲Southeast Wins. The strength of the Southeast B team is quite strong. In the first half, they used their official lineup and scored 28 points. Starting in the second half, the entire Southeast lineup was changed. Although Shanghai Middle School tried hard, they were unable to score. As a result, Southeast won with 42 points.</p>

<p>▲Chongde Wins Against Liangjiang Second Team The competition between Chongde and Liangjiang's B team was quite fierce. Chongde's players were small, exquisite, brave, and daring. Misses Wang Xiangying and Zheng Yuai were especially skilled. The whole team coordinated well. Liangjiang's talent was uneven, and individual skills were not sufficiently trained, so they achieved little. The first quarter was relatively even. In the second quarter, Chongde's momentum was strong, scoring a total of 15 points. The score in the first half was 25-1. As a result, Chongde won decisively with a score of 36-10.</p>

<p>▲East Asia Defeats Kiangnan The final A league game, Kiangnan vs. East Asia, was extremely interesting. The actions of both sides were swift, and the competition was fierce. East Asia's basketball skills have greatly improved, quite different from their previous game against Liangjiang. Kiangnan's basketball skills were also impressive, so the scores were very close. In the first quarter, it was 6-4. In the second quarter, it was also 6-4. Kiangnan was ahead in both. The total score for the first half was 12-8, with Kiangnan leading. The situation was very different after the break. East Asia's forwards were highly active. Misses Qian Hangsu and Li Baohui were active and scored many times. Although Kiangnan's Deng Mingshang and Liu Mali also scored, the situation became tense. East Asia once chased to 18-19, only one point behind Kiangnan. Then, Miss Deng from Kiangnan scored two goals in a row. At the end of the third quarter, each team scored 13 points, for a total of 25-21, with East Asia still four points behind. In the final quarter, East Asia's surprise attack emerged. First, they tied at 29-29, and then, although Kiangnan scored two more goals, their defense suddenly became flustered. East Asia's forwards advanced step by step. The score was eventually surpassed from a tie to a 32-29 lead. East Asia turned defeat into victory by 3 points. Kiangnan suffered a crushing defeat by three points.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Turning Defeat into Victory: Qingguang Defeats Nanxing <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲Kiangnan Defeats Dare-to-Die Xiqing</p>
<p>▲Four B League Games, Wanxing Wins Decisively</p>
<p>▲McLane's B Team Full of Ambition</p>
<p>│Xiqing Basketball Game Results Last Night│</p>
<p>In the Xiqing basketball game last night, two A league games and four B league games were played. Among the two A league games, Qingguang B's victory over Nanxing was the most intense and moving. Qingguang gathered veteran players to form a strong team, but in the first half, they were completely defeated, 7-21. Fortunately, the situation changed in the second half. As a result, Qingguang turned defeat into victory with a score of 37-31. Kiangnan easily defeated Dare-to-Die with a score of 46-27. Among the four B league games, Wanxing's victory over Dongwu was the most splendid. McLane's B team defeated Tongwen 70-12 in a fierce match. McLane's B team has high ambitions in the B league.</p>
<p>▲Qingguang Forcefully Defeats Nanxing</p>
<p>▲Nanxing Approaches Step by Step Nanxing is a strong team from Jiaotong University. Although the team was formed not long ago, they have many brave players. Among them, Liu Liangzhan and Bao Xindi are outstanding forwards with agile movements who can use surprise tactics to win. In the first half, Liu and Bao scored successively, scoring five consecutive goals, while Qingguang had not yet scored. Bao Xindi then made a free throw. Only then did Qingguang open their scoring, making it 11-2.</p>
<p>▲Qingguang Utterly Helpless Qingguang is composed of veteran players. With the recent addition of John, the great defender Lin Zequn, their strength is even greater. However, due to insufficient practice, unfamiliar tactics, and slow movements, repeated attacks were unsuccessful, and shooting accuracy was far off. In such a poor environment, they were utterly helpless. Nanxing, on the other hand, attacked step by step. In the first half, it was 21-7, and Qingguang was badly defeated.</p>
<p>▲The Situation Suddenly Changes Under such a poor situation, Qingguang changed their lineup, with Hu Zhichao as the right forward and Fang Junming as the defender. After 25-13, the situation suddenly changed. Hu Zhichao, Liang Guoquan, and Xu Kepei broke through successively, and Lin Zezhang also rushed in from the back, scoring 12 consecutive points and tying the score at 25-25 in an amazing comeback. Nanxing then added two points, but Lin's long shot tied the score again. The atmosphere was tense. As Nanxing's situation changed, their experience was lacking, and they gradually became flustered, making many mistakes. Qingguang then won 37-31.</p>

<p>In the game between Kiangnan and Dare-to-Die, Kiangnan easily won because Dare-to-Die was not very strong. Huang Zhaolin's shooting was very good. Dare-to-Die had only a small beard, Tou Ren, and the rest could only sigh at the basket. However, Dare-to-Die once took the lead, 4-2, 6-2, 6-5. Kiangnan then chased to 7-6 and took the lead, with Dare-to-Die unable to catch up. The result of the first half was 25-15. In the second half, although Dare-to-Die was still full of a defeated attitude, Kiangnan won 46-27. Before the end, Gong Wanyu, the three-iron athlete from Liaoning, filled the Kiangnan defender position and should be noted.</p>

<p>▲Results of Four B League Games</p>
<p>Among the four B league games, the most remarkable was the one between Wanxing and Dongwu. Wanxing has many veteran players. Last year, they failed in the finals against Hujiang Middle School Attached to the University. This year, they still hope to perform as well as last year. Dongwu had a good record last year, but the strong players scattered. As a result, last night became a one-sided game. The result of the first half was 27-7, and the final result was 48-17. Wanxing's center, Li Siliang, scored 17 points and was very brave. The results of the other three games are as follows: (1) Eagle Team wins over Wing Team 57-39, first half 21-19 (2) Moore wins over the School of Law 38-20, first half 22-12 (3) McLane's B Team wins over Tongwen 70-12, first half 33-2 points.</p>
<p>▲McLane's B Team is Fierce and Terrifying McLane's B Team has high ambitions to win the B league championship this year. Players from the A team, such as Kai Leisiding and Heng Fuli, have all joined the B team this year, showing their intentions. The center, Keith Carter, and the left and right forwards, Gordon Davis, are extremely tall. Tongwen looks like a long person and a dwarf in comparison, with no way to cope. Other teams should be wary of them.</p>

<p>▲Result: 53 to 22</p>
<p>│Hujiang's Short Passes Are Outstanding│</p>
<p>There was a wonderful friendly basketball game in the China Basketball Hall at 8 pm last night, namely Hujiang University vs. the US Navy Rochester team. The basketball skills did not seem to be very strong. Hujiang's performance was wonderfully incomparable. Knowing that they were at a disadvantage due to the small size of each player, they invented the American football passing method. The ball came from the shadows, going back and forth and passing low. The movements were very agile and elusive. The coordination and shooting were so wonderful that they were sighed at. It was appropriate that the US Navy was unable to cope and was utterly defeated. In the first half, Hujiang won 24-9. In the first thirty minutes, Hujiang scored a total of 43 points, and the Navy only 14 points. Later, Hujiang changed their entire lineup, and the US military improved slightly. The result was 53-22, and Hujiang won a great victory. The referee was Hall.</p>

<h3 id="e114">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Prepare for Revision of Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲ Request to Allow the Cotton Textile Industry to Dispatch Representatives</p>
<p>▲ Discussing Increasing Import Taxes on Cotton Fabrics</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the National Government, addressed to the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Finance: "On the 17th of this month, a letter was received from the Shanghai Silk Mercerized Cotton Textile Trade Association, stating that our Association previously submitted a document to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on August 3rd, requesting an increase in import taxes on cotton fabrics to protect domestic goods. We believe that the underdevelopment of our national industries is due to many reasons, but the crux of the problem lies in the lack of tariff autonomy. All major powers in the world use tariff barriers to protect their domestic industries, a fact that your ministries are well aware of. Since the late Qing Dynasty, due to the failure of diplomacy, customs taxation has been controlled by foreigners due to unequal treaties. As a result, machine production has advanced rapidly, and the golden age has passed in vain. The national production still remains in the handicraft stage. Even those with aspirations to revitalize industry, although creating new industries, are quickly overwhelmed by foreign goods. This is truly the sub-colonial status described by Sun Yat-sen. Since the establishment of our National Government, we have been deeply aware of this problem and have paid much attention to tariff autonomy. However, those in charge at the time, ignorant of commercial affairs, sought quick solutions, and subsequent scrutiny revealed a lack of practical understanding. Taking the cotton fabrics produced by the members of our association as an example, they have always been a major import, and their impact on the national livelihood is significant. However, the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement signed on May 6, 1920, included them in the category of mutual benefit. When the news spread, the whole country was in an uproar, and a major mistake was made that could not be undone, which we have painfully endured to this day. As the agreement is about to expire, it is appropriate to plan ahead. Our association urgently appeals to you to resolutely announce a tax increase when the agreement expires in 1933, in order to protect domestic goods. We also request that during the preparatory period, our association be allowed to send representatives to contribute their opinions, which would benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our association has a deeper understanding of the industry and believes that the survival of domestic goods and industries depends on this. We believe that all of you share the same feeling. However, a long time has passed without a response from your ministries, presumably because our association is small and our words are not enough to attract the attention of your ministries. We have learned that the agreement expires on May 6, 1933, which is fast approaching. We urge you to strongly present this matter to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, etc., for prompt preparation and a clear response to satisfy our expectations." The Association stated that the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement was formally signed on May 6, 1920, at which time both parties stated in their notes that the tax rates for items 1, 2, and 3 of Part A of the attached schedule would be maintained for three years. After the expiration of the three-year period, the declared tax rates would naturally be revised. The Trade Association believes that the tax rates on cotton fabrics in the aforementioned agreement only benefit the import of goods from the other country. They request that the import tax on cotton fabrics be increased after the expiration of the three-year agreement and that the Trade Association be allowed to send representatives to contribute their opinions during the preparatory period before the expiration of the agreement, which is indeed for the purpose of protecting our country's cotton fabrics. It is appropriate to report the situation and request your approval from the Yuan and Ministries, and to revise the agreement in a timely manner to protect domestic products. We eagerly await your response. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests. Xiao"</p>
<h3 id="e115">Press Visited the Construction of the City Center Area Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲ City Government Sends Staff to Host</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Center Municipal Government Building is scheduled to be completed by the end of June next year, and the Municipal Government and various bureaus are scheduled to move into the building to work on July 1st next year. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, the Municipal Government specially prepared cars to invite more than 50 members of the local press to visit. Tan Wenqing, Section Chief of the First Division of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, Xue Cixin, Section Chief of the Third Division, Mo Heng, Section Chief of the Fourth Division, Chen Kecheng of the Municipal Government Propaganda Section, Chen Xunyu, and others warmly hosted the visit. The details of the various new constructions in the city center area are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Design Process: In July 1927, when the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, it first requested the Central Government to determine the scope of the city area, including Wusong, Jiangwan, and other areas. In November 1927, a design committee was established to study various issues related to municipal administration. At the same time, given that the Municipal Government was located in a remote area of West Shanghai and various bureaus were scattered throughout the city, making it inconvenient to conduct business, the idea of constructing a Municipal Government building arose. In September 1928, a committee for the construction of the Municipal Government building was established to prepare everything. In July 1929, the plan for the city center area was announced and a construction committee for the city center area was established to oversee everything. All matters related to the construction of the new Municipal Government building were also assigned to this committee. Although there was a slight suspension due to the war this year, work was resumed as soon as the situation stabilized. After several months of progress, considerable results have been achieved. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>▲ General Area: The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the city's population is increasing daily, land prices are rising, and the housing problem is the most difficult to solve. Traffic tools are improving daily, and the width of Shanghai's existing roads is insufficient. Most of the wharves have no connection with the railways, and the concessions extend across the center of the city, while the cross-border construction of roads is expanding daily in the northwest and southwest directions, hindering the development of the city. Therefore, there is a proposal to construct a city center area, defining an area of more than 6,000 acres north of Xiangyin Road, south of Zhayin Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of Zhou Nan Shi Wu Yi. This area is equidistant from Nanjing Road and the Bund to Fanwangdu Road, making transportation convenient. Moreover, the terrain is flat, the air is fresh, and land prices are low. There is also a good plan to lay the foundation for future progress, and the future development is unlimited.</p>
<p>▲ General Description of the New Building: Although the city center area has been designated, it is still an open space, and it is feared that investors will hesitate. Therefore, it was decided to first construct the Municipal Government building in the city center area to show encouragement. In January 1930, a reward was offered for the design of the Municipal Government building. In July of the same year, an architect's office was established to draw formal drawings, and architect Dong Dayou was hired to oversee the project. In May 1931, bidding began, and the Zhusenji construction company won the bid with a price of 548,000 yuan and began construction. Since the groundbreaking ceremony on July 7th, work has been carried out actively. It has now been built to the roof and is engaged in interior decoration. It was originally scheduled to be completed this month, but due to the impact of the war, it must be postponed until May of next year. The new building is 30 meters high, 90 meters long, and 25 meters wide. The exterior adopts the Chinese architectural style, while the interior uses steel and concrete construction. The building has four floors. The ground floor is for offices and a cafeteria, etc. The second floor is for the auditorium (the auditorium is 25 meters wide and 18 meters deep and can accommodate more than 1,200 seats), conference rooms, libraries, etc. The third floor is for offices, and the fourth floor is for archives and storage rooms, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Bureau Buildings: As the new Municipal Government building is about to be completed, but the new bureau buildings have not yet been built, it is planned to temporarily construct temporary office buildings for the various bureaus in the new Municipal Government building that is under construction, so that the Municipal Government and various bureaus can move in at the same time. It is estimated that after the completion of the new Municipal Government building, in addition to the Secretariat, the Finance and Public Works Bureaus can be temporarily attached to it. The remaining bureaus are planned to build two temporary buildings. The Social, Education, and Health Bureaus will be in one building, and the Public Works and Land Bureaus will be in another building. The two buildings are in the shape of a right angle and are located behind the new Municipal Government building, one on the east and one on the west, in the same style and symmetrical to each other. Each building is 96 meters long on the outside, 61 meters long on the inside, and 42 meters wide, and is a three-story new-style building. It is estimated that each building will cost more than 100,000 yuan, and bidding will begin soon to rush the construction so that it can be completed at the same time as the new Municipal Government building.</p>
<p>▲ Police Station Building: The aforementioned temporary office buildings for the various bureaus do not include the Public Security Bureau. The bureau plans to temporarily remain in the South City and first build several police district stations in the city center area, depending on future needs. The one currently being built is one of the stations, and its location is at the corner of Songhu Road and Xiangyin Road, which is the most important location, occupying an area of 3,900 square meters. It is a steel and concrete building with complete equipment and can accommodate more than 100 police officers. The cost, including water and electricity equipment, is estimated to be about 30,000 yuan. Construction began in August of this year and is currently ongoing.</p>
<p>▲ Project Management: The city of Shanghai has a vast area, and all road projects have management offices in suitable locations in each district to facilitate nearby construction. The roads in the city center area officially started construction in December of last year. After the war, work was resumed even more actively. Therefore, the construction of the management office building cannot be delayed. Bidding began at the beginning of this year, but construction was suspended due to the war until July, when work resumed. Its location is on the north bank of the Qiujiang River, surrounded by bamboo fences. Inside the fence, the south is the factory shed, which is where tools are placed. The north has a row of garages, which is where trucks transporting materials are parked. The central square can be used to pile up the applied materials (there is another material factory). At the west end, there are three large open halls for offices. Other affiliated buildings include staff dormitories and long-term worker dormitories. The total cost is 16,000 yuan and was completed in September.</p>
<p>▲ First Public Cemetery: The Municipal Government believes that the city's cemeteries are all privately run, and their benefits are not widely available to the general public. Therefore, the first municipal cemetery was opened in the Gaoyemiao area, and affiliated buildings such as auditoriums were built, covering an area of more than 90,000 square meters. Construction began in June of last year. First, a small river was dug, and the excavated soil was used to fill the ground. A wall was built in front, and there were seven rooms on the left and right of the gatehouse, including the gatekeeper and reception rooms. The two wings are used as temporary mortuaries for keeping coffins before burial. In the center of the garden, facing the gate, is the auditorium, which is a five-room hall in the Chinese palace style and was completed last month. In addition, the cemetery is planned with routes, drains, and roads. This project is currently underway. The cemetery is divided into several areas and is expected to accommodate more than 4,000 graves. The entire project is expected to cost 90,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Road Paving: In order to prosper the city center area, the Shanghai Municipal Government publicly solicited the remaining part of the land acquired last year, totaling more than 800 acres, at a low price in July of last year. All of the land was claimed on the same day. The subgrade earthwork within the scope of this land will be completed by the end of this month, and most of the road surface base has also started construction. It is estimated that it can be completed by the end of the year. All of the people who have claimed land in this area can now start to build houses, because the roads are all open, and it is very convenient to transport materials. The second solicitation of land and the land claimed by the municipal government staff was held in October of last year. The earthwork project for the roads within the scope of this land is scheduled to start at the end of this month and is expected to be completed by next spring. This earthwork is all taken from dredging the Qiujiang River and the Yuanzhang River. Dredging the river and filling the road serve two purposes. Light railways and railcars are now used to transport and pile up the soil to a considerable location. It is estimated that more than 2,000 workers are used, and the amount of soil that has been filled is about 100,000 cubic meters. The budget for the total road filling is 320,000 cubic meters of soil. The width of the roads in the city center is stipulated to be from 15 meters to 35 meters. There are currently 22 roads under construction, with a total length of about 19 kilometers. The total length of roads in the entire area is about 50 kilometers. All roads are built with asphalt surfaces and planted with trees on both sides, and the grass is laid underneath. It can be seen that a beautiful park residential area will appear in front of us. As for the ditches that should be set up under each road, preparations have long been made, and the production of tile pipes has begun, and steel sheet piles have been ordered from Germany. The large-scale arrangement of ditches will begin next spring.</p>
<p>▲ Bridge Construction: The city center area is located on the banks of the Huangpu River, and the Qiujiang River winds through it from west to east. There are six bridges across the Qiujiang River, all built of steel and concrete, and the exterior is made in the Chinese style. Drawings have been made and bidding will begin soon. Construction will begin simultaneously at the end of this month, which will not only facilitate transportation but also add to the scenery of the Qiujiang River.</p>
<p>▲ Park Development: A park is being developed to the southwest of the new Municipal Government building, and a part of it has already started construction. The park has sports fields and tracks, which are also under construction. Trees have been planted separately. The area is about 400 acres, which is larger than Zhaofeng Park. The Qiujiang River runs through it, and the scenery is natural. Therefore, the magnificence and beauty of the city center area in the future will definitely not be comparable to the concessions. In addition, there are three large parks that will be developed soon, as well as many garden areas. The location of the parks is one in the southwest of the new Municipal Government building, one in the southeast, one in the northeast, and one in the northeast on the banks of the Huangpu River. The garden areas outside this include the Jiangwan and Yinxiang racetracks, the Sijing Bridge ball field, and the area along the edge of the city center area.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Chinese Business Electric Company's Labor Strike: Party and Government Order Resumption of Work <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲ After the General Manager Was Rescued, an Emergency Board Meeting Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Fortunately, None of the Injured Are in Life-Threatening Condition</p>
<p>After the workers of the Chinese Business Electric Company went on strike, trams on all routes continued to be suspended yesterday. The Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department discussed the handling of the matter at a meeting in the morning and issued a joint announcement in the afternoon, ordering the workers to resume work before noon today. If they dare to disobey, the employer is allowed to dismiss them and recruit new workers. All public utilities are guarded by armed police officers to protect them. The company held a temporary emergency board meeting. The injured workers and soldiers are not in serious condition.</p>
<p>▲ Rescue of the General Manager: At 9 PM the night before, Wen Yishan, the captain of the Fourth Squadron of the Police Brigade, and Jin Tian, the district chief of the Second District, repeatedly advised the workers who were gathered in the factory and surrounded General Manager Lu Bohong. The workers finally left the factory and dispersed at about 9 PM. Lu Bohong was then escorted out of the factory and returned to his residence by the police officers. By about 10 PM, the soldiers of the Security Brigade were withdrawn, and traffic on Chezhan Road was restored. The Fourth Squadron of the Police Brigade dispatched two squads to guard the factory to prevent incidents. Armed police officers patrolled near the South Railway Station at night, and security was tight.</p>
<p>▲ Protection of Water and Electricity: After the Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Security Office to send police to protect the city's public utilities to prevent the water and electricity supply from being affected, Wen Hongen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was ordered to send police officers from the Third and Fourth Squadrons of the Police Brigade, and Yang Hu, the director of the Security Office, was ordered to send soldiers from the Tenth Squadron to jointly guard the Gaochangmiao Waterworks and the Chezhan Road Electric Factory that night. The security at the main switch gates was particularly strict, so the city's water and electricity supply will definitely not be affected.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Situation: Starting at 6 AM yesterday morning, workers from the Chinese Business Electric Company went to the company on Chezhan Road one after another. The police officers on guard tried their best to maintain order. It was not until about 9 AM that the workers who had gathered at the company were dispersed and returned to their homes. Only Lu Zhonglin, the director of the Vehicle Department, and tea servants stayed in the company. The gate was closed, leaving only a small door for entry and exit. Police officers from the Fourth Squadron of the Police Brigade guarded the inside and outside of the factory and questioned those entering the factory very strictly. Trams on all routes were still suspended.</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Meeting: The Party and Government organs held a meeting at the Municipal Party Department on Ximen Linyin Road yesterday morning at 10 AM to discuss concrete handling measures. Those who attended were Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Municipal Party Department members Wu Kaixian, Tao Baichuan, Secretary-General Jiang Huaisu, Security Office Director Yang Hu, Social Bureau Director Wu Xingya, Third Section Chief Xu Yefu, Second Section Chief of the Public Security Bureau Yan Shuzhai, etc. They decided on handling steps and dispersed at 11:30 AM. According to a report from the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the measures were: first, the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department will issue a joint announcement, ordering the workers to resume work before noon on the 20th. If they fail to do so, the employer will be allowed to dismiss them and recruit new workers. As for the injured, after investigation, the perpetrators will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<p>▲ Joint Announcement: The Central News Agency reported that yesterday, the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government issued a joint announcement regarding the expansion of the Chinese Business Electric Company's labor strike, ordering the resumption of work this afternoon. The full text of the announcement is recorded below. It is a joint announcement regarding the labor-capital dispute of the Chinese Business Electric Company. Since the company's workers submitted a request for a salary increase, the association reviewed it in accordance with the law and sent it to the Social Bureau on October 27th. On November 1st, the Social Bureau, together with the association, convened a hearing. At that time, the representatives of both parties were still able to reach an agreement. Later, it was decided to convene a mediation on the 12th of the same month. However, the representative of the employer stated that the company's directors had left Shanghai and had not returned, so he requested a postponement. The mediation was rescheduled for the 15th. As the oral replies of the representatives of both parties were not clear enough, the chairman of the mediation committee ordered both parties to submit written replies separately and immediately sent personnel to both parties the next day to urge them to submit their reports. This is the mediation process for the issue of the company's workers requesting a salary increase. However, the company's Vehicle Department workers suddenly went on strike yesterday morning, gathering crowds, coercing, and besieging the company's manager, refusing to accept advice. When the police team arrived to maintain order, there were criminals throwing bombs and injuring people. Such outrageous actions are extremely hateful. However, the riot yesterday showed that there were bad elements instigating it from the middle. The association and the government are deeply concerned that the company's workers will be instigated by them and innocently implicated. In addition to issuing a general order to strictly arrest the leaders and investigate them according to the law, we urgently issue a joint announcement ordering the company's workers to comply with it and uniformly restore the original state before 12:00 noon on the 20th. If they dare to disobey, the employer will be allowed to dismiss them and recruit new workers. Do not hesitate and delay, or you will mislead yourselves. The salary increase issue will still be the responsibility of the Social Bureau, together with the association, to actively mediate in order to resolve it as soon as possible. Each of you must abide by this and not neglect it.</p>
<p>▲ Board Meeting: After General Manager Lu Bohong was rescued, he reported the incident to the board of directors. As the matter was of great importance, a temporary emergency meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Directors such as Du Yuesheng attended. It was decided to request the Party and Government organs to investigate the matter strictly and order the workers to resume work as soon as possible in order to maintain business.</p>
<p>▲ Injuries: Wu Liang, the injured squad leader of the Security Office, and soldiers were sent to the Ye Lu Hospital in Xiaonanmen. Their injuries are not life-threatening. As for the injured workers Wang A-Si, Chen Hongfan, Qi Bingyuan, Zhu Shunquan, Qin Jiarong, Hu Hengqing, Zhang Jiashu, Li Fugen, Wang Xiyuan, Hu Shuangfu, Zhu Kaifa, etc., were sent to Renji Hospital. Except for Wang A-Si, who was seriously injured, the rest were not in danger. Those with minor injuries were bandaged by doctors and discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Li Guojie Was Escorted to the District Court Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲ Prosecutor Xie Opened Court for Preliminary Hearing</p>
<p>▲ Li Is Currently Ill and Said to Be Well Treated</p>
<p>Former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Li Guojie and former Supervisor Chen Fumu arbitrarily mortgaged the four warehouses to the American Business Company. Afterwards, Li Guojie was placed under surveillance. Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiajua arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to meet Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, after which it was decided to hand him over to the judicial authorities for handling.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>▲ Transferred to the Court: Yesterday morning at 11 AM, Director Wen ordered the Third Section to prepare a document and send four detectives and four police officers to escort Li Guojie to the District Court Prosecutor's Office by car. After the court received the document, Chief Prosecutor Wei appointed Prosecutor Xie Lian to open the court for a preliminary hearing. As the preliminary hearing is usually kept secret, it was impossible to interview the results. He was temporarily detained in the detention center, but he was treated quite well. When he was escorted into the detention center at 3 PM in the afternoon, his wife brought servants to send bedding, etc., and requested to be with him, but there was no such law, so she gave up.</p>
<p>▲ Li Is Ill: Li Guojie's body was weak. After being placed under surveillance, he became ill immediately. His wife tried her best to plead for his release for days. After the court investigated yesterday, it was found that Li's illness had worsened, so the court arranged for a doctor to treat him that night, and his wife was still trying her best to request bail.</p>
<p>▲ Liu Hongsheng Speaks: The Xinsheng News Agency reporter visited General Manager Liu Hongsheng last night. According to him, the method of recovering stocks announced by the Ministry of Communications in the newspaper is actually a draft that has not been formally approved. As for the future handling of stock registration, we will actively prepare after receiving orders. Li Guojie, who was under surveillance, was notified by Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiajua to be handed over to the court for trial and was investigated twice. It is reported that Li Guojie is ill.</p>
<p>▲ Appointed Secretary: After the Board of Directors and Supervisors began working, the Board of Directors appointed Wu Benjun as the secretary. As for the articles of association of the Board of Supervisors, the General Manager's Office, etc., have been announced, and the detailed rules for handling affairs have also been drafted by each department and will be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval and implementation after they are passed.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Sino-British Geng款 Committee Held Its Last Finance Committee Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Preparatory Meeting Will Be Held in Beijing on the Third of Next Month</p>
<p>The Sino-British Geng款 Committee held its third Finance Committee meeting at the Bank Association Building on Hong Kong Road at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Those who attended were still Chairman of the Board of Directors Zhu Jiajua, Chairman of the Finance Committee Zeng Rongfu, members Chen Qicai, Song Ziliang, Ma Xier, Director-General Hang Liwu, directors Ye Gongchuo, Donna, Kang Cui, Director of the Department of Finance of the Ministry of Railways Chen Yaozu, and Director of the Department of Works Saffo. The discussion lasted for four hours until about 6:00 PM in the evening before it ended. It was heard that the loans for the Yuehan and Longhai Railways had been discussed. The Finance Committee will not continue to meet, but although there have been some results regarding the loan of 2.5 million pounds for the Yuehan Railway, the situation regarding the purchase of materials is complicated, and there is no detailed plan to determine it for the time being. The loan of 500,000 pounds for the Longhai Railway is a small amount and should not have any problems. The committee has decided to hold a preparatory meeting in Nanjing on the third of next month, and then hold a general meeting on the fifth. The preparatory meeting will only discuss meeting affairs and will not discuss other matters. The general meeting on the fifth will conduct formal discussions in accordance with what the Finance Committee has formulated. However, it is not known whether it can be decided immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The International Relations Research Association Welcomes Dr. Gu Ziren <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The International Relations Research Association held a general meeting of all members at the Bank Club at 5:00 PM on the 18th to welcome Dr. Gu Ziren. Chairman Chen Liting delivered an opening speech, and then Dr. Gu reported on the situation in the United States, saying: "The last time I went abroad was at the invitation of the American Williamstown Justitue of politics to attend the association's lectures. When I arrived at Williamstown, the association had already held it for two days. There was still no representative from our country at this meeting. Those who attended the political association were all members. The lecture time was in the evening, and the main topics were (1) the Sino-Japanese issue (2) the world economic issue. My attendance was specifically for the Northeast issue. There were six or seven Japanese representatives. Dr. Nitobe took turns hosting members every night. It can be seen that the Japanese attach importance to publicity. In terms of topics, Chinese representatives talked about the entire Chinese issue, Japanese representatives talked about the entire Japanese issue, and Dr. Nitobe's lectures were mostly taken from Japanese warlords. People said that the political association's meeting was almost entirely for Chinese publicity. On the positive side, I promoted it; on the negative side, the Japanese insulted China and tried to cover up their atrocities. The more they tried to cover it up, the more they revealed it, giving the Americans a considerable understanding of the Sino-Japanese issue. The Japanese representatives in the United States had various assistance, and the speakers had secretaries to assist them, but I was alone. Although I was not completely isolated, I encountered various difficulties. It is undeniable that the Japanese lectures had prepared drafts in advance, but because I had no one to help, I had to speak impromptu. However, if I did not deliver the original manuscript to the reporters after the lecture, they would often misunderstand the original intention and publish it in the newspaper. This is the difficulty I deeply felt. The arguments made by the Japanese at the political association that were not made in the past were (1) China is an unorganized country (2) China only has a few thousand years of ancient culture. Therefore, China and Japan have different international statuses, so Japan cannot be held responsible for destroying the Washington Treaty in this conflict. Dr. Nitobe also had an argument, denouncing the Chinese as an inferior race in the world. When the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, the Chinese never showed any resistance, and then sought help from other countries. In fact, the decadent spirit of the Chinese has been passed down for thousands of years. When the Japanese did evil, the New York Times did not say a word. When there was civil war in China, it publicized it, saying that civil war had broken out everywhere in China, proving that China was unorganized and unsystematic. This kind of publicity had a great influence on the psychology of the Americans." In addition to attending the Williamstown Political Association, Gu also went to more than 90 public and private organizations in other parts of the United States to give lectures.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Bai Shuren Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Leave Shanghai on the 25th</p>
<p>Dr. Bai Shuren, the president of the American China Famine Relief Association, came to China to inspect relief affairs. He traveled south from Beiping on the 16th with An Xianjin, the inspection director of the China International Famine Relief Commission. He arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 18th. Those who arrived at the station to welcome him that day were: Baker, Director of the Transportation and Storage Department of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, Lin Qi of the American Consultants Committee, and You Zhiren, the director of the Shanghai Office of the China International Famine Relief Commission. That evening, Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance and Chairman of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, held a banquet at his private residence on Qiqi Road to welcome the doctor. The doctor is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 25th to inspect other places. During his stay in Shanghai, in addition to visiting various Chinese and Western charitable organizations, he also plans to visit Jiaotong University, American schools, and other places. It is heard that those who will host banquets to welcome him in Shanghai are: the American Advisory Committee at the Citibank on the 21st at noon; the Chairman of the Shanghai Bank President, the China International Famine Relief Commission Yangtze River Relief Committee, Chen Guangfu, at the Shanghai Bank on the 23rd at noon; and the Shanghai Public Association Joint Conference at the Bank Association on the 20th at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>▲ Cai Runsen, a committee member of the Fruit and Produce Trade Association, is traditionally enthusiastic about national affairs.

He is also soliciting donations from his fellow traders, and the amount is expected to be substantial.</p>
<p>▲ The Fireworks Trade has already pledged to pay over $300 monthly, which will be remitted to the bank at the end of the year for transfer to the Northeast. It is reported that they are continuing their fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>▲ The Umbrella Trade Association, besides Zhao Tianmin, Zhu Chunbo, and Lu Zhankui, three committee members, each pledging $100, are also soliciting donations from fellow traders and manufacturers. Once a certain amount has been raised, it will be handed over.</p>
<p>Other associations, such as the Chinese Merchants Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Trade Association, the Oil Pressing Factory Trade Association, the Curio Trade Association, the Seafood and Sundries Trade Association, the Weights and Measures Trade Association, and the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Trade Association, will also establish fundraising teams to conduct fundraising soon.</p>
<p>▲ The National Goods Company will donate 2% of its total sales for three weeks from the 19th of this month to aid Northeast refugees and disaster areas in the three provinces.</p>
<p>▲ The South Vietnam Restaurant plans to donate 5% of its total revenue from four days, November 20th, 27th, December 4th, and 11th, for aid.</p>
<p>▲ The China National Amateur Athletic Federation held a charity volleyball match on November 5th, raising $110.65 from ticket sales. The funds have been designated as a donation to aid Northeast refugees and have been sent by accountant Zhao Tianpeng.</p>
<p>▲ Qiu Ping Lao Ba, a resident of the Xin Hui Le Li area, upon reading a newspaper report about the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association's declaration, specifically sent a letter to the association's donation division yesterday, donating $50 as an initial contribution from the sisters in the Bei Li area. The association issued a receipt accordingly.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Zhongbao, a robust man with a smiling face, wearing a short coat, arrived at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Northeast Refugee Relief Association donation division at 3 PM yesterday. He claimed that he deeply admired the righteous people outside the pass, who were fighting heroically against the enemy in the icy and snowy conditions. He offered his savings of $5, requesting that it be remitted to the Northeast. He expressed some embarrassment that the amount was so small. The association issued a receipt, and he departed. It is reported that this man, Zhang Zhongbao, runs a beef stall at the Hongkou small vegetable market. Such a stall owner is truly exemplary.</p>
<p>▲ Charity Performance Tonight: The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association's charity performance to aid the brave soldiers will be held tonight for two consecutive days at the Tianchan Stage on the Fourth Avenue. The association finalized the program yesterday and sent letters along with it to each ticket purchaser. The revised program is as follows (November 20th Evening Show): Pang Jingzhou Fights Changsha (Qiu Jianfei), Fan Hengde, Wu Laopu, Xiaoyaojin (Cheng Yonglong), You Jusun, Wang Yifang, Bawangzhuang (Tan Shaopei), Ge Ruiquan, Tianlei Ji (Xu Ziquan), Xue Yanqin, Zhang Rushi, Bi Chunfang, Complete Selling Horses Record (November 22nd Evening Show): Lin Shusen, Jin Shaoshan, Old City Meeting (He Wuliang), Wu Laopu, Sun Qingfen, Second Palace Entry (Qiu Jianfei), Lion Tower (Sun Lanting), Yu Yeshu, Sun Luping, Zhuge (Sun Lanting), You Jusun, Wang Yifang, Phoenix Mountain (Tan Shaopei), Eight Great Hammers (Xue Yanqin), Zhu Rushan, Pang Jingzhou, Complete Mu Guiying Visits Her Son.</p>
<p>▲ Students from the sophomore and junior grades of Lehua Women's Middle School on Fuxu Road voluntarily saved money from their candy expenses to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army, setting an example for the entire school. Grade leaders He Xiuhua and Kang Xinyu collected dozens of dollars from their classmates and handed them over to the school principal for forwarding.</p>
<p>▲ Qu Wenliu's Letter: With respect, your telegram regarding receiving the funds for cotton clothing is noted. Elder Yang arrived in Changchun on the day indicated. According to reports, 15,000 sets of cotton clothing are being custom-made in Changchun. This association has already remitted $50,000, which should be sufficient. Funds for aid can be sent directly to the association's office in Harbin. The office in Ping has not yet been organized and will be formally established before the date indicated. The expenditure of $20,000 for the porridge kitchen has been fully handed over to Elder Bing for management. The Ping office also intends to supervise various porridge kitchens, and it is truly heartbreaking to see so many elderly and young people in single layers of clothing. Aid should still be sent to Harbin for Elder Yang to distribute. The return date from the south is yet to be determined. Yingguang respectfully bows.</p>

<p>When the Pan-Pacific Women's Association held its second conference in Honolulu, China sent Dr. Ge Chenghui, Ms. Fan Guan, and Ms. Zhang Xiaosong as representatives to participate. Since their return last autumn, the September 18th Incident occurred, and various groups were busy with national crisis work and were unable to hold meetings to report on the conference. Now, as preparations for the third conference of the Pan-Pacific Women's Association require immediate attention, it is necessary to convene female leaders from various circles who are concerned about international issues to discuss matters together. Therefore, a meeting was held at 3:30 PM on the 18th at the conference room of the YWCA at 19 Yuemingyuan Road. Representatives from the Shanghai Women's National Goods Promotion Association, the National YWCA, the Shanghai Women's Rights Movement League, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai YWCA, and the Chinese Women's Association, including Shen Yibin, Shu Huizhen, Ouyang Jun, Wen Shihui, Wu Wanfang Xia, Xue Weizengpei, Mei Jianghezhen, Li Buge, Li Huizhen, Zou Cui, Tian Cuibao, Gao Junming, and Shi Baozhen, were present.

<p>▲ Zhou Zhiyuan Seems to Have No Enemies</p>
<p>▲ Two Men Commit the Heinous Crime</p>
<p>▲ An Unfamiliar Guest Behaving Suspiciously</p>
<p>▲ What Was Discussed During the Two-Hour Conversation?</p>
<p>Zhou Zhiyuan, a native of Wuchang, Hubei, was 47 years old and resided at No. 1046, Lane 2, Siwen Li, Datong Road, Xinzha Road in Shanghai. He previously worked as an inspector at Jardine Matheson in Nanjing. However, due to poor business conditions, he was laid off. After arriving in Shanghai, he was introduced by a friend to work as a general affairs officer and accountant at the Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Branch of the China World Red Swastika Society at No. 7 Danshui Road, earning a monthly salary of $30. According to staff members of the society, Zhou was very amiable and harmonious with his colleagues. He was also very frugal, taking care of all matters at home, big and small. Around 8:30 AM yesterday, Zhou got up as usual and went to the market to buy vegetables. Shortly after returning home, his wife, Zhou Wang, 29 years old and a native of Wuchang, was still asleep. As Zhou stepped onto the steps of the back door and used his key to open the door, two men, about 30 to 40 years old, suddenly chased after him and fired two shots at him with handguns. One shot hit the ground, and the other entered Zhou's left ear and exited through the top of his right head. Zhou immediately fell to the ground. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, turned and fled. Zhou's second landlord heard the noise and came out to see Zhou lying stiff in a pool of blood. He quickly went upstairs to wake up Zhou's wife and immediately reported to the police station. At 9:15 AM, Zhou was taken to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. However, due to his serious injuries, he died at 9:35 AM. The police station sent the body to the Fielun Road morgue for examination and dispatched personnel to investigate the scene of the incident and to strictly apprehend the murderers. According to staff members of the Red Swastika Society office, Zhou rarely had social interactions with outsiders. However, two fellow villagers of Zhou visited him at the society the day before. They spoke in their local dialect, so no one knew what they were discussing. They talked for over two hours before leaving. Zhou even saw them off at the door. Colleagues at the society found the actions of these two guests quite strange.</p>

<p>▲ Seventy-Nine Dollars and Trinkets Taken Away</p>
<p>▲ The Pancake Shop Owner Is Delightfully Happy</p>
<p>▲ After Strict Interrogation by the Indigenous Detective</p>
<p>▲ The Truth Is Revealed, Joy Turns to Sorrow</p>
<p>Ni Yazi, a woman from Yangzhou, is 28 years old and of average appearance. She lives near No. 2125, Fulu Li, Yangshupu Road, where her fellow villager Zhao Xiang (22 years old) runs a pancake shop. Ni often visits the shop to buy pancakes and has known Zhao for a long time. Recently, seeing that Ni's emotions were developing, Zhao enticed her in every possible way, hoping to fulfill his desires. On the 1st of this month, Zhao told Ni that he wanted to become her lover and would first give her two silver dollars to inlay a gold tooth as a token of his sincerity. Ni took the money home. Her father, Ni Yuanlong, and mother found out and asked about the source of the money. Ni, embarrassed, could not answer and was scolded. Ni told Zhao the truth. After Zhao and Ni discussed the matter, Zhao instructed Ni to take the opportunity to steal valuables and bring them to his shop. Then, he would take her to his house on Zhujiabang Road, Yangshupu, to live together and avoid parental control. Since Ni Yazi was not Ni Yuanlong's biological daughter but an adopted daughter at the age of two, Ni Yazi was pleased to hear this. On the afternoon of the 3rd, she secretly stole seventy-nine dollars in cash, gold rings, and other items and took them to Zhao's shop. Together, they rode to an unmarked flat on Zhujiabang Road. That night, at 8 PM, Zhao defiled Ni Yazi, treating her as his wife. After Ni Yazi disappeared, her father, Ni Yuanlong, found out that the aforementioned items were missing. He asked people to search for her everywhere, but there was no news. He then reported to the Yangshupu police station. After several days without any progress, he placed an advertisement in the newspaper with a clear description of his daughter's age, figure, clothing, and photograph, seeking her whereabouts. Zhao Xiang, upon reading the newspaper, knew that he could not hide for long and worried about being caught. He instructed Ni to surrender herself to the police station the day before, falsely claiming that she had run away from home after being scolded by her parents and had been staying with a girlfriend in Pudong. She claimed she now wished to return home and requested that a detective be sent to escort her back. However, the Chinese detective Wang Jinsheng, an experienced investigator, knew that Ni's words were not true. After interrogating her strictly, Ni told the whole truth. Wang Jinsheng immediately reported to the police chief and, along with a foreign detective, secretly went to the pancake shop and arrested Zhao Xiang, taking him into custody. Ni was sent back to the Ni family. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Zhao to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the details of the case, stating that the defendant should be punished according to Article 370, paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code for intimidating and defrauding. However, although the defendant denied sending the threatening letters received by the victim, whether or not he was the perpetrator still needed to be determined through handwriting analysis and investigation of evidence. Therefore, a postponement was requested. Ni Yuanlong then testified about the circumstances of receiving the letters. When Zhao Xiang was questioned, he confessed that he was married but was not on good terms with his wife. He claimed that Ni Yazi had run away to his house to stay temporarily. He claimed his mother informed him at the shop, and he returned home and told her to go home, but she refused. She said she had a relationship with his younger brother and had previously asked a matchmaker to seek marriage, but her father did not agree. He claimed that her allegations of him giving her two silver dollars, inlaying a gold tooth, and spending the night together were completely false. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered the defendant to be detained pending further investigation. The reporter then asked Ni why she had committed suicide and who the Miss ○○ (withheld to prevent further complications) mentioned in the letter was. The reply was that the so-called Miss ○○ was named Xue. They were classmates at Zhoulin Elementary School in Zhangjiabang. He was very affectionate towards her and wanted to marry her, but she did not reciprocate. Now that she has married someone else, he committed suicide. Zhou Changming can be described as a single-minded lover who suffers from unrequited love.</p>

<p>▲ Wu Zhangsheng's Sister Seeks Inheritance</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Tongzhao Suddenly Arrives to Mediate</p>
<p>▲ Admits to Writing Anonymous Letters</p>
<p>▲ Extortion Letters Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Wu Zhangsheng, a local resident residing at No. 36, Maqi Road, Yidaojiao, Huaxi, owns a substantial ancestral estate. In addition to his wife and children, he also has a younger sister named Mituo, who is still unmarried. In the summer of this year, Mituo suddenly abandoned her sister-in-law and fled alone, her whereabouts unknown. After several days, she returned home on her own accord. Wu Zhangsheng did not investigate the matter thoroughly at the time. One day, an unexpected guest arrived at the Wu's residence, claiming to be Zhang Tongzhao. He claimed that Mituo's goddaughter was her close friend and that he had learned that Mituo wanted to divide the inheritance with her sister-in-law. Therefore, he came to visit Wu Zhangsheng to mediate and avoid litigation. Wu Zhangsheng was out on that day, so his wife, Wang, briefly interacted with Zhang. Zhang left a note before leaving, firmly instructing Wang to hand it to Zhangsheng. Several days later, Zhang continued to visit but only met Wang, who claimed that her husband did not want to meet with him to discuss family affairs. Zhang's two attempts were unsuccessful and met with rebuffs, so he left dejectedly and never visited again. He immediately hired two lawyers on behalf of Mituo and filed a lawsuit against Wu Zhangsheng, seeking a division of the inheritance, requesting a separation of 100,000 yuan, with the contract stipulating that half would be taken as a reward. Having been sued, Zhangsheng decided to wait quietly for the legal resolution. Unexpectedly, on the 14th of last month, a letter was delivered by the postman. Upon opening it, the language was extremely fierce, demanding 20,000 yuan to be paid between 5 and 6 PM on the 17th of this month at the Ningbo Hall on Minguo Road in the French Concession. The person going there would be identified by holding two rolls of woolen yarn. Wu sent the letter to the Geden Road police station for investigation. The police chief immediately sent detective Liu Chunshu to the Ningbo Hall on the appointed date with other detectives to wait. After waiting all day, there was no sign of anyone. On the 19th of last month, Wu received another threatening letter with similar wording, but the amount demanded was reduced to 5,000 yuan, and it was agreed that the meeting would still be at the Ningbo Hall the next day. However, when Detective Liu went there at the appointed time, he still returned empty-handed. Since then, Wu had not received any more letters of this kind. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, Wu received an anonymous letter stating that if he wanted to resolve the matter of his sister's request to divide the property, he could contact Zhang Tongzhao. Wu ignored it after reading it. On the 12th, a second anonymous letter arrived, continuing to mention the division of property and adding that if he wanted to know who wrote the letter, he could check the note left in July. Only then did Wu realize that these letters were actually written by Zhang Tongzhao. Therefore, he began investigating Zhang's address. The day before, he discovered that Zhang was also a local resident living at No. 74 Guanyinge Street, Xinkaihe, and was now working as a clerk at a certain Russian news agency at No. 19 Bowuyuan Road. Therefore, he reported the matter to the Geden Road police station, which sent detective Liu to arrest Zhang at his home but found no one. He then went to the news agency and arrested Zhang, taking him into custody for questioning. Zhang only admitted that he had written the two anonymous letters, one by asking his friend Ding to write it and the other by writing it himself. He also admitted that he wrote the note left at Wu's house. He denied sending the two threatening letters that Wu had received. Yesterday morning, the police station brought Wu Zhangsheng and his wife to the First Special District District Court to be interrogated by Judge Wu Zhen. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang described the case and stated that the defendant should be punished according to Article 370, paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code for intimidation and fraud. However, although the defendant denied the threatening letters received by the victim, whether or not he was the perpetrator still needed to be determined through handwriting analysis and investigation of evidence, so a postponement was requested. Wu Zhangsheng then described the circumstances of receiving the letters. When Zhang Tongzhao was questioned, he stated that the anonymous letters he wrote were to persuade the plaintiff to reconcile with his sister and that the 50% reward was lawyer's fees. He claimed that although he hired a lawyer, he had no selfish motives. Judge Wu then ordered the defendant to be detained for handwriting analysis and further interrogation.</p>

Fortunately, the Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting valiantly and has repeatedly defeated the strong enemy, fighting for the survival of the nation and for the glory of the country. At this time of severe cold, the Volunteer Army still holds the spirit of patriotism, unyielding and unswerving, vowing to fight to the death with the dwarf invaders, which is truly admirable. Zheng and others, in view of this situation and as members of the nation, cannot bear to sit idly by and have invited patriotic people to organize a transportation team to go out and help regain lost territory as soon as possible.

<p>The crucible manufacturers Ruihe, Yifeng, Zhaofeng, Jingming, Jinghua, Zhonghua, and Ling Factory jointly telegraphed the Zhejiang Construction Department yesterday, stating (titles omitted): "Our factories require crucible raw materials. Previously, due to boycotting Japanese goods, we switched to purchasing from Qingtian and Yongjia. Recently, local bullies Lu Keming, Guo Luchuan, etc., seeking personal gain, have obstructed and blocked the transport. We presented this matter to the Yongjia County Government and requested the Ou Customs to stop the transport. Our factory petitioned the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Citizens Advocating National Products Association, requesting them to present the matter to your department and the Yongjia County to seek relief. We now find that the supply of raw materials to Shanghai has been interrupted for nearly a month. If prompt assistance is not provided, not only will all work cease, leading to unexpected incidents, but also various factories in need may still purchase Japanese goods, losing our rights. We urgently telegraph, hoping you will investigate and promptly issue separate telegraphs to the Ou Customs and Yongjia County, allowing the normal release of crucible raw materials for transport, to maintain the industry. Furthermore, we request that the mining license be legally applied for by several factories, etc., and not allow the local bullies to act as accomplices for the Japanese, deceiving you. Please issue the license to prevent their treacherous schemes."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Wang Boqun Submits Document to Central Government Regarding Yongnian Earth Transport Case <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲If There is Concrete Evidence of Trafficking, I Will Accept Guilt</p>
<p>▲Requests the Central Executive Committee to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Former Minister of Communications Wang Boqun submitted a document to the Central Party Headquarters regarding the Yongnian earth transport case, stating: "Submitting this document regarding the Yongnian earth transport case, which has unexpectedly led to unfair criticism, directly damaging my personal reputation and indirectly affecting the dignity of the Party and the nation. I earnestly request you to uphold justice to clarify the truth. I, Boqun, was ordered in June of this year to inspect Sichuan, traveling for three months, and only in early September did I complete my official duties and return east. At that time, my mother was ill, and I was eager to return home. Since the Yongnian ship was faster and there was no need to transfer along the way, I boarded the ship on the 8th with my entourage from Chongqing. Because I needed to report the inspection results to Chairman Chiang, I planned to disembark in Hankou. At the beginning of the voyage, I heard rumors that someone was taking this opportunity to smuggle opium. Since opium was almost openly traded in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Chongqing was a gathering place for special goods from the Southwest, and also a place of morphine production, merchants paid taxes to transport and sell it, and every ship carried it. Moreover, there were special officials to investigate and arrest smugglers, so there was no need to overstep my duties. However, I warned my entourage to conduct themselves with integrity and ordered them to inspect every checkpoint. On the 10th, many cases of passengers smuggling were discovered. On the 11th, when I and my entourage disembarked in Hankou after inspecting our luggage, the local special tax office seized a large quantity of opium and morphine on the ship. I immediately asked Chairman Chiang to investigate the matter strictly, stating that although the waters were connected, the clean and dirty were distinct, and those who sought personal gain should be warned. Although I once worked with Shuangqing, he was now an official in Guizhou Province. He was ill when I left Chongqing, and his wife had a strong addiction, which was well known. However, whether there was opium or morphine in his luggage was difficult to interfere with, even though we were on the same ship, as he was not under my command. These were the facts at the time, but the public, not understanding the truth, made wild speculations based on my old relationship with Shuangqing. Local newspapers also exaggerated the rumors and deliberately defamed me. However, I believed that although public opinion could confuse the audience for a time, the truth would eventually come out after Chairman Chiang ordered the relevant authorities to investigate impartially. I did not have time to refute each and every unfair accusation. Unexpectedly, the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters also picked up rumors and accused me of trafficking in opium in a resolution opposing the public sale of opium, which was shocking. On October 31st, the Central Daily News, the propaganda organ of our party, also used ambiguous words to subtly criticize me. I have followed the Prime Minister in the revolution for more than twenty years and have confidence in my personal conduct. I have sacrificed myself in many situations, regardless of gains or losses. I have served in the central government for many years and have seen the chaos of factions within the party, which is not a sign of political prosperity. I have always adhered to the principle of treating people with kindness, not flattering or being opportunistic in order to seek political purity. This has led to a concentration of resentment. I have been slandered and defamed many times over the years. Since our party came to power, times have been difficult and the nation has been plagued by many problems. Political enemies outside the party have conspired to subvert us, and malicious slander has been rampant, leaving no stone unturned in discrediting and alienating our party cadres. Since my honor and disgrace are closely linked to the party and the government, they have taken this opportunity to insinuate and attack me, directly damaging my personal reputation and indirectly insulting the dignity of the party and the government. Their poisonous schemes are not surprising. However, the party headquarters at all levels are the branches of our party, and the Central Daily News is the mouthpiece of our party. I believe that our comrades who serve in the party headquarters at all levels and in the Central Daily News should take a stand based on their position and use fair arguments and a calm attitude to seek the truth based on the facts in order to silence the slanderers and maintain the prestige of the party and the government. However, the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters and the Central Daily News have not done this, repeating what others have said. Not only are they harming each other, but they are also helping the enemy and making those close to us angry and those who hate us happy. This is truly a cause for weeping over party discipline and morality. Moreover, in terms of the case, the place where the trafficking originated was Chongqing, and the place where it was discovered was Hankou. It is not difficult to know whether I am involved. Opium has always been openly traded in Chongqing. Who bought it and who sold it at that time? Once investigated, the truth will be revealed. Also, whether there are special markings on the boxes and luggage seized in Hankou that belong to me personally, and whether the detainees have made any confessions involving me, the party headquarters in each place can easily make a judgment. Furthermore, in terms of law, there are clear provisions against fabricating facts with the intention of damaging the reputation of others. Without concrete evidence, personal opinions should not be used to arbitrarily slander. Moreover, some say that I have inherited the legacy of my ancestors and can afford to live a comfortable life. I have always saved money and worked hard for public welfare. I am not like someone living in an empty house, so desperate that I would choose any means. There are many ways to make money; why would I risk my personal reputation and violate the law for such a profit? Even if we take a step back and assume that I intended to traffic in opium, I could have contacted the specialized authorities beforehand to facilitate passage. Why would I have been caught halfway and even ordered the checkpoints to inspect as if nothing had happened? A little investigation into this matter will reveal the truth. If we must judge others based on worldly preferences, then how can there be anyone in the world who cherishes their own integrity? In short, the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters and the Central Daily News, ignorant of the facts and interests, and without investigating the case and the truth, have made arbitrary decisions and unfounded comments. Not only am I personally being defamed, but the party and the nation are also being implicated. After careful consideration, I cannot remain silent. I am submitting this document detailing the circumstances of the case and my personal feelings, earnestly requesting your council to uphold justice and clarify the truth. If there is concrete evidence that I have engaged in trafficking or acted for personal gain, I will accept guilt and submit myself to the sanctions of the law and party discipline. Otherwise, if I am innocent and have been unfairly accused, then the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters and the Central Daily News should bear corresponding responsibility. I will accept your judgment on how to correct or admonish them. I have poured out my heart and anxiously await your orders. Furthermore, I have returned from Sichuan and have traveled through mountains and rivers. My old illness has relapsed. Once I have recovered, I will return to Beijing to attend meetings. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. Wang Boqun."</p>

<h3 id="e137">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Urging Swift Resolution of Telephone Price Increase Issue <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲Prevent the Use of Coercive Measures to Achieve Unilateral Benefits</p>
<p>▲Please Adopt the Six Proposals Made by Taxpayers</p>
<p>The taxpayers of the Public Concession recently sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, outlining six major reasons why the Municipal Council should be approached to negotiate the issue of telephone price increases, in order to reach a swift resolution. Key excerpts from the document are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council. Yesterday, the Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating: "We have received letters from the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association and the Nanjing Business Community United Association, stating that our members Sanxing Factory (telephone 94834), Hefeng Hao (telephone 94944), Shichangtai Hao (telephone 94798), Maoshenghe Hao (telephone 94717), and Changfeng Hao (telephone 94683) have reported that their telephone bills have either been paid at the old price for the autumn and winter seasons or have not been paid pending resolution of the price increase negotiations. However, on November 13th, the Shanghai Telephone Company cut off their lines, rendering their telephones unusable. They request that our association advocate for them." "Upon investigation, our association, representing the majority of its members, maintains that the price should not be increased excessively. We have outlined the reasons in a letter to your council, urging you to advocate for them. Our association hopes that 'the company will cancel the price increase and establish a fair price, taking into account the interests of both parties and seeking a compromise that is suitable for all.' We originally hoped to resolve the dispute and put an end to it as soon as possible. However, the company has ignored this intention and has not given it any consideration. It is now resorting to unreasonable disconnection measures. Its sole justification is that it has been approved by the Municipal Council, so it dares to pressure users and become more and more aggressive, doing whatever it wants and disregarding everything. It is even cutting off the lines of users who have already paid the old price for the autumn and winter seasons, which is even more contrary to commercial ethics. We fear that if this stalemate continues, there will be no positive outcome. If users who have been disconnected experience a fire during this period and suffer unlimited losses due to their inability to use the telephone, who will be responsible? This matter concerns social peace and public communication. We are writing to you again to request that you investigate and provide prompt assistance, etc." Furthermore, Shao Renhua wrote, stating that "recently, the Shanghai Telephone Company suddenly increased prices and retroactively charged for past bills, causing opposition from Chinese and foreign users, who have successively requested that your council protest repeatedly. It is said that justice has not been completely extinguished and that the company, considering the situation and reflecting on its actions, should eventually seek a peaceful solution. I have used the telephone in my home for nearly twenty years and have always paid my bills promptly. I have never complained about the lack of service. This time, I am facing this unexpected situation and share the same feelings as other users. I have been questioned and criticized, so it is naturally inappropriate to remain silent. Before a resolution is reached, I have repeatedly paid the original amount without receiving a receipt and have temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Given my long-standing status as a good customer, I cannot rashly use pressure and harmful measures to satisfy the notion of might makes right. Otherwise, it would be like someone with the power of life and death arbitrarily punishing someone with death for the slightest dissatisfaction. Last Wednesday, I suddenly received a letter from the company, not only not returning the receipt but also demanding that I pay the new fee within four months or face disconnection and a reinstallation fee of twelve taels. Left with no choice, I planned to pay the new fee but temporarily refused to pay the retroactive amount. As a result, the telephone in my home is now silent. I anticipate that many other users will face the same treatment and will be forced to pay. For the sake of the whole, I can only ask your council or other associations to make a final protest and make a responsible plea. According to reason, even the new fee should be notified two months in advance) so that this matter can be brought to a fair conclusion and prevent society from being in constant turmoil. Otherwise, please announce a plan so that everyone can follow it (or next time, let everyone refuse to pay and have their phones removed together to resist. After all, decades ago, people lived and worked in peace without telephones. Moreover, the market is now so depressed). I have the following questions and hope that your council will consider whether they are viable, which would be very fortunate, etc." and attached ㈠ whether the telephone users all have contracts with the telephone company, and whether the so-called contract contains equality and the meaning of mutual agreement, and at least the principle of public judgment in case of incidents as in other contracts; ㈡ whether the company, even if it has a contract with the user, can rashly increase the price without first seeking consent and notification, and can retroactively charge electricity fees for more than three months in the past because it has not achieved its desired purpose and regardless of whether the user can afford it; ㈢ if this retroactive recognition becomes a reality, then if the company needs to add income due to expenses or miscalculations affecting the business situation, whether the retroactive establishment or even the need for as many as thirteen months will be followed by users as well; ㈣ whether the user has the right to use the telephone if the original price is paid before the contract is legally canceled, or whether the company can arbitrarily increase the surcharge and immediately stop the service and remove the electrical equipment, making the user submit one by one; ㈤ if the company’s issuance of orders is so dictatorial, what rights do users hold in the contract and what does the meaning of it all mean, and can a public exclusive undertaking do whatever it wants, and will all other contracts lose their effect; ㈥ if the improvement of equipment increases the cost of assets and the income should also increase, it is undeniable, but whether it needs to be recovered in the long term and gradually, or whether the company holds the power of calculation and control to the extreme degree; The association has repeatedly informed your director of the telephone price increase dispute and requested the board of directors to reconsider it. Before the board of directors has reconsidered and decided, your director should prevent the telephone company from using the high-pressure means approved by your bureau, which is still opposed by taxpayers, to violate the unilateral interests, and the lack of careful measures has led to this increasingly complex problem, and the association is very worried about it, and it may be possible for the company users to cause mutual inconvenience, and the director is responsible for solving the problem in view of the association’s view of the civil society joint association and the nanyang road business circle united association, and please your director to explain each of shao renhua’s questions one by one so as to turn over the correspondence to be handled.</p>
<p>▲Bei Zuyi Sends Letter to Taxpayers' Association. Accountant Bei Zuyi sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, stating: "I am writing to you to report on a conversation I had with Mr. Zhong, the director-general of the Municipal Council, regarding the telephone price increase issue. I visited him at 10:00 AM on November 16th, accompanied by Mr. He Dequi, the council's representative. I have summarized the contents of the conversation below: Mr. Zhong first reported on the situation of the telephone company since it took over the China and Foreign Telephone Company, stating briefly that the telephone price increase was due to the Municipal Council accepting the telephone company's report. When the company took over the China and Foreign Telephone Company in 1929, Mr. Anson calculated that the telephone price should be increased by 25% immediately based on the company's economic situation. After careful consideration by the Municipal Council's board of directors and the Public Utilities Committee, it was determined that it could not be maintained without a price increase, and all the people on the board of directors and the Public Utilities Committee, including foreigners, had deeply studied it through Chinese and foreign lawyers. At that time, the telephone company voluntarily waited until the automatic telephone was completed before increasing the price. Now that the work within the boundary has been completed, it can be increased in accordance with the contract. This matter has been handled through legal procedures and is not Mr. Zhong's individual proposal. Recently, the telephone company has reported that from the time it took over to the end of March of this year, it lost a total of 218,432 yuan in regulations, and it is estimated that it will lose a total of 242,000 yuan in regulations by next year (with a copy of the original letter given by Zhong Sijun attached). Regarding the issue of building roads and installing lines across the boundary, a contract has now been signed with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Those who build roads across the boundary must pay the Municipal Government 12 yuan per user per year, and those who do not build roads across the boundary in the Chinese boundary must pay 60 yuan per user per year, and must also pay the Ministry of Communications 12,000 yuan in regulations per year. The telephone company is willing to bear the cost of this payment so that the telephone charges inside and outside the boundary are the same. This loss can only be added to the telephone rate, otherwise, how can the telephone company maintain itself?" (Zu Yi said) "The law is not retroactive, not only Chinese law but also all countries' laws. This should be noted." (Zhong Sijun said) "I personally feel that this layer is not very appropriate, but it has been thoroughly researched by the telephone company's Municipal Council lawyers and is considered to be no problem." (Zu Yi said) "Since Mr. Anson proposed to increase the price rate in 1929, why not do it at that time? At that time, the social and economic situation was different from the present, or it would not be as difficult as it is today. Now it seems that it is not the time to release this when the social economy is in a very depressed state. Has the telephone company made public the company's situation as described by Zhong Sijun? Now the Chinese side has not learned, so the telephone company must let the users understand the company's situation before they can cooperate. Even if you must increase the price rate, you should invite representatives from the Municipal Council, the telephone company, and the users to consult and discuss the methods. The telephone company and the users have an original contract, and the expenses that the users should bear are specified in the contract, and the contract is signed by both parties. The telephone company's price increase is a unilateral claim and did not notify the users in advance. This layer is still not in line with the general procedures." (Zhong Sijun said) "The telephone company's only income is telephone bills. If the telephone company cannot maintain its cost, how can it serve the users? Like a store's goods, there must be a cost calculation to determine the selling price. It cannot force the store to sell the goods at a loss just because the buyer's economic strength is weak. Now the telephone company's income is not enough to cover the cost, so there is no way to pay ordinary dividends. If this is the case, who would be willing to invest again? There will be no one to run this telephone business and there will be no telephone supply within the boundary. If the Municipal Council takes it over and runs it itself, where will the Municipal Council get this funding and cannot afford this loss? At that time, it is still a matter of tax increases for the people. This is a matter of fact and cannot be forced. As for the telephone company's situation, it has been announced one after another or has not paid attention." (Zu Yi said) "Telephones are a public undertaking and are exclusive, so they cannot be compared with other profit-making businesses." Zhong Sijun did not answer this question. (Zu Yi said) "Today's newspaper reported that the telephone company has started to cut lines. Please pay special attention to this, for fear of unexpected unfortunate incidents." Zhong Sijun replied that this matter should be noted. The above conversation is related to the telephone price increase issue. Other ordinary polite words will not be repeated. But Zu Yi</p>

<p>still has opinions, but because of the time it has been a long time, each other's things are tight and can not fully express, I had to resign and leave. Because it is related to public interests, I will specially return the summarized situation and hope to check it out for reference and easy to solve.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Municipal Government Orders Crackdown on Zhabei Tenants Obstructing Reconstruction <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government ordered the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus, stating: "Recently, it has been heard that Zhabei tenants are obstructing the repair and reconstruction of houses damaged during the war, and that there are also general unemployed vagrants who, seeing vacant houses, recklessly move in regardless of the danger, even gathering into dozens of households and claiming to be old tenants, forcibly occupying the premises. This is seriously hindering municipal administration and affecting construction. In addition to separately ordering the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus, we hereby order the bureaus to immediately investigate and crack down in conjunction to prevent danger."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has installed automatic switching exchanges for the Nanshi and Zhabei bureaus.

<h3 id="e140">Second Special Court Burns Narcotics <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Court, from July to the end of September of this year, confiscated narcotics such as opium, morphine, and red pills, as well as gambling items from cases resolved by the French Concession Police. The fourth burning was scheduled for yesterday afternoon. The Ministry of Justice Administration and the Third High Branch Court were notified in advance, and the military, political, police, and judicial organs in Shanghai were sent separate letters to send representatives to supervise the scene. The details have been reported in the previous report. The Logistics Section hired workers to build a reed shed on the vacant lot next to the court in the east and arranged the site. Yesterday morning, Feng Meixue, director of the Stolen Goods Section, ordered the workers to move all the narcotics and gambling items to the site and arrange them one by one. There were a total of 826 cases of opium, morphine, red pills, and smoking paraphernalia. In addition, the four cases from the previous session that were appealed and not yet finalized were also included. Representatives from various organs in Shanghai who arrived at the scene included Li Zeng from the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, Ma Mingchu from the Municipal Government, Lu Youchang from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, Ren Bin from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Jin Yuxi from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Wu Fengwen from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Hang Dingan from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Sun Zhixing from the Second High Branch Court, Tang Zaili from the Third High Branch Court, Lin Xichou from the Prosecutor's Office of the Third High Branch Court, Ju Zhijing from the Shanghai First Special Court, Zhang Yaoguang from the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court, (French name, phonetic transliteration) from the French Concession Police Department, and representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers' Association.</p>
<p>After arriving at the court, they were received by Court President Shen Xiqing, Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, and Chief Clerk Xiao Jinfang. Then, clerks Wei Yuwei, Wang Baoxun, and Ren Qiwu supervised the workers to open and inspect the various narcotics, weigh them, and carry them to the center of the site, where they were piled with firewood and kerosene for ignition. Adding salt to the fire caused black smoke to rise and a foul odor to fill the air.</p>
<p>After the narcotics were burned, the gambling items were burned until the evening. The representatives left one after another. The narcotics burned this time included 1,771 opium pipes, red pill pipes, and other accessories. There were also about 300 catties of opium, hundreds of pounds of red pills, morphine, heroin, cocaine, and copper, ceramic, and glass utensils used to manufacture narcotics. The gambling items included 817 sheets of flower lottery tickets, mahjong, poker, pencils, abacuses, and other items.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Citizens' Movement for Rent Reduction on North Jiangxi Road <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The 26th District Branch of the Municipal Federation of Associations reported that more than 50 households, including those in the Fanzhi, Rongsheng, and Gengfu Lane residences, Zida, Honglou, and Guangchengli, and other residents of North Jiangxi Road, requested rent reductions because the road construction has not been completed and the post-war environment is harsh, resulting in empty houses, few people, and a sluggish business market, making it very difficult for shops to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, they jointly requested the landlord, the Far East Company, to reduce rents to help the market. The association convened a temporary meeting of members from North Jiangxi Road at 8:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 people attended, including Wang Binpei, Ye Rongji, Tang Guansong, Zhuo Biye, Lu Ping, Gong Huimin, Zhou Kun, Li Guanglin, Xu Xianhua, Liang Chunlin, Wu Zhong'an, Ou Yuehua, Zhang Bingji, Tong Hongyuan, Wang Yuchen, Gui Tang, Zhao Guangyu, and Li Changzhao Ganyu. Zhu Muye, Ni Yangzhou, and Zheng Dongshan were elected as the presidium. After the report was completed, the following resolutions were passed: ㈠ The rent for Fanzhi, Rongsheng, and Gengfu Lane will be calculated from the date of completion of the road construction. ㈡ Due to the sluggish market and the difficulty of maintaining shops, a 30% rent reduction is requested. ㈢ Before the rent reduction is resolved, the rent will be deposited in the bank. ㈣ Zheng Dongshan and Zhu Muye were appointed as representatives to negotiate with the landlord. ㈤ Yu Hualong and Chao Kun were hired as legal advisors. ㈥ The party, government, and other organizations of the Municipal Federation of Associations were requested to uphold justice. ㈦ Wang Yuchen, Liang Chunlin, Gong Huimin, and 10 others were appointed as members of the rent discussion committee. ㈧ The patrol donation issue will be paid after the road is completed, and a letter will be sent to the donation office to discuss it. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Shengshun Li Housing Association Negotiates Rent Reduction Without Success <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲ Landlords Insist on Differentiating Between New and Old Tenants</p>
<p>The tenants of Shengshun Li, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, suffered substantial losses due to the January 28th Incident. After the agreement was reached, most of the original tenants moved back in. A small number of tenants, for special reasons, did not return and sublet to relatives and friends. Shengshun Company, the management company of the area, disregarded the suffering of those who had survived the looting and took the opportunity to oppress them, coercively increasing rents twofold and charging a monthly "small rent" (which old tenants could avoid). The tenants of the area, citing the rent reduction examples in various places after the war, believed that rents should be appropriately reduced, but instead they were doubled, which they could not afford. They collectively decided to demand that the landlords reduce rents by 20% of the original price. A delegation appointed by the association went to negotiate the other day, but to no avail. The landlords requested that new and old tenants be distinguished first, before further negotiations could take place. They stated that new tenants had agreed beforehand and had contractual relationships, so they could not be discussed together, while old tenants might be open to discussion due to their long-standing relationship. After careful discussion by the association's executive committee, it was determined that since there was no distinction between new and old houses in the area, the rent prices should not have any distinction. They jointly decided to notify all tenants to deposit their rent in the bank starting from November, to prevent the landlords from using rent arrears as an excuse for long-term demands. The letter from the association to the landlords reads as follows: Respectfully, according to the report from our association representatives Zhou Qibin and Yang Lisan, who were ordered to go to negotiate with you regarding the rent reduction issue in this area, the situation has been brought to the meeting. After deliberation by the ad hoc executive committee, it was resolved that since there is no distinction between new and old houses in this area, the rent prices should not have any distinction. This kind of proposition is absolutely unacceptable. The proposition to coercively increase rent twofold amidst the voices for rent reduction after the war is even more against the trend of the times and is not allowed by the facts and reasons. In short, the tenants of this area should enjoy equal treatment. Before the rent dispute is resolved, each tenant will pay 80% of the original pre-war price starting from November and deposit it monthly into the Shanghai Bank on the boundary road, to prevent anyone from using rent arrears as an excuse for long-term demands. The association has been responsible for notifying accordingly and recording the case, submitted for your review and processing, which is in the public interest.</p>

<p>The residents of Shun'an Li on Changchun Road, Zhabei, fled during the Shanghai battle, as the area was under Japanese influence. After the Public Security Bureau moved back to its original location in mid-June, the tenants also moved back. However, there were few residents and business had not recovered. Now, the landlord, Chen Shunji, believed that the tenants' request for a five-month rent exemption and an eight-month rent reduction was difficult to accommodate. Therefore, the Shun'an Li Tenants' Autonomous Association reported all the hardships and the landlord's coercion to move out to the municipal government, requesting a fair resolution.</p>

Although the association has held eight membership drives, and the achievements of each drive have exceeded the original goal, none have been as enthusiastic as this one.

Unexpectedly, after the opening of the membership drive, the three announcements had reached a high of 25,000 points. Such an achievement was truly unexpected and we must thank the efforts of the team leaders and members and the enthusiasm and love of our fellow countrymen.

Xiao'an is lucky to be able to accomplish it and is deeply grateful. Now it is the closing time. Recalling the beginning of the solicitation, the goal was quite large and the deadline was tight. At that time, it was said that it was difficult. However, today the results obtained have exceeded the set amount. This is due to the enthusiasm of my fellow countrymen for public welfare, and the efforts of the team leaders and members who have worked tirelessly. Furthermore, the solicitation is coming to an end and the association affairs urgently need to be carried out. We especially hope that you will correct and support us, so that the businesses that have been run can be improved day by day and the future businesses can be expanded day by day. The Ningbo Association is dedicated to all my fellow countrymen and we thank you for your blessings.

<p>▲ Dalong Driver Stands on Zhongshan Road</p>
<p>▲ Three People Board the Car and Speed Away</p>
<p>At about 7:40 AM yesterday, an unknown man suddenly came to the Dalong Motor Company on North Henan Road in the Public Concession and claimed that he wanted to hire a car to visit a friend. The company ordered driver Zang Shengcai (34 years old, Ningbo native) to drive a sedan with Public Concession white license plate No. 18138. The man sat in the car and told the driver to drive to Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. The driver started the engine and sped west. When he reached a remote place near Daxia University on Zhongshan Road, three people stood there. The man in the car ordered the driver to stop. The man jumped out of the car and rushed up with the three people. Two of them each held a pistol and dragged the driver down first. The other two jumped into the car, started the engine, and sped away, watching the driver stand on the roadside and not allowing him to make a sound. After about two hours, he was released and walked away. The driver, realizing that the car had been robbed without a trace, immediately ran to the Sixth District Police Station and the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room to report. After arriving back to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room around 1:00PM, they notified the company to retrieve the car.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, a man came to stay at the Dazhong Inn at No. 16 Yangjiadu Street, Wai Ma Road, Nanshi. He registered as Xia Weirong, 22 years old, from Ningbo, and opened room number 11. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM yesterday, the tea room saw that he had not yet gotten up and entered the room, discovering that Xia was lying stiff on the bed and was dying. They immediately reported to the accounting room and sent him to the Sixteenth Putili Red Cross Hospital. After being given five injections, he did not recover and died. He was determined to have swallowed a large amount of opium for too long, so he could not be treated. Only five pawn tickets and a letter were found on him. The letter was addressed to Xu Renlin, Dapu Bridge, and mailed from Ningbo. The cause of death was irrelevant. It is thought that he committed suicide because he was desperate. The report was sent to the First District Police Station, and Lu Rongde, the Sixteenth Putili district head, was ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

The Wanguo Funeral Home handled this matter with extreme care, and its hearse was the top-class car, both beautiful and sturdy, and its manager, the American Mr. Scott, personally drove the car.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Association held a plenary committee meeting at its clubhouse on Liu Ma Road at 7:00 PM last night. Chairman Deng Xisheng read out the previous motion, followed by Tang Youwei reporting on the progress in the past week. After discussion, it was generally believed that the foreign merchants had not made any clear statement, so the government bond method was still unable to proceed. At present, the insured in the disaster area were starving, freezing, and had no way to go. Most of the insured held the principle that it was better to die for the public interest of the insured than to starve or freeze to death. The public was extremely agitated and unstoppable. The association should respond to the trend of the insured and quickly determine a method. Therefore, the following cases were agreed upon: ① Publish a warning that all foreign merchants should express their willingness to resign automatically as soon as possible to avoid endangering themselves ② Notify all insured that if foreign insurance companies do not express the same position as Chinese merchants, those who have insured should cancel their insurance and those who have not insured should stop insuring ③ Request the municipal government and the central government to establish insurance businesses in national or local banks and to organize insurance cooperatives by the people ④ Decide to prepare to continue claiming compensation, first ask the executive committee to convene a general meeting quickly to expand the organization ⑤ An extraordinary shareholders meeting must be held every three days to prepare all effective work for practical use ⑥ The executive committee appointed representatives to go to Beijing to petition. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>The white-collar workers in the North and South cities who specialize in making barrel parts demanded that the store owners increase their wages by 10 cents per day, starting this month, because their wages were meager and insufficient to make ends meet. The workers petitioned the store owners to increase their wages accordingly. However, the store owners believed that the wage increase was too large, some agreed to increase it by 5 cents, and some prevaricated that it would be implemented uniformly by all stores before they would increase it. The workers were very angry. Yesterday afternoon, they convened a meeting of all workers at the First Spring Restaurant outside the Old North Gate and decided to send representatives to the stores that had not increased wages and the stores that had agreed to increase them by 5 cents to request that they quickly increase wages in consideration of the workers' difficulties. If there were any who refused to increase wages, they would take action. The small parts workers in the Wenzhou-Taizhou gang also demanded a wage increase because their wages were meager. Representatives have now been sent to the union.</p>

The bureau also believes that it is closely related and is willing to fulfill its obligations, so the low price is surprising and it is a good opportunity to buy furs that are difficult to meet in a lifetime.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor, Greetings. I am writing in astonishment after reading the news "All Shanghai Students to Meet Tomorrow" in your newspaper on the 19th. It states that all Shanghai students of all ages and various cultural groups are scheduled to meet at our school at 9:00 AM on the 20th. Our school was not informed of this matter beforehand. All the classrooms in our school are very small and cannot accommodate so many people gathering. Furthermore, our school has not set up an office for this meeting. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction, hoping you will publish it in the local news section to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. With best wishes, Daxia University Admissions Office, November 19th.</p>
<p>To the Reporter, Greetings. Today, your newspaper published a news item in the local news section titled "All Shanghai Students to Meet Tomorrow," which stated that the preparatory committee for the joint association of all Shanghai students supporting the Northeastern Volunteer Army against the Lytton Commission's report had appointed Chen Bin as an honorary member of the association and that he would attend and give a speech. In fact, the association did not obtain Chen Bin's consent for this matter and had already received a polite refusal in a letter the day before. I am writing to request a correction. With best wishes, Chen Bin, November 19th.</p>
<p>Greetings. I have read the news published in your newspaper about the strike and disturbances of workers at the China General Edison Company. The facts are slightly inconsistent. Here are the facts of the matter: (1) Since February, the workers of our union have requested the company to improve their living and treatment. More than half a year has passed, and the management has not sincerely adopted any measures. Even after repeated mediation by party and government organs, there has been no result, leading to widespread indignation and a work slowdown. (2) After the streetcar key was lost in the morning, the workers seized the opportunity to spontaneously slow down work. Upon learning of this, the directors of our union immediately rushed to the company to persuade the public to restore traffic and await mediation, but to no avail. Subsequently, representatives of party and government organs held a meeting, but there was still no solution. (3) After implementing the slowdown, the workers collectively demanded that Lu, the company manager, immediately agree to the salary increase conditions. Unexpectedly, at around 3:00 PM, because the workers were tired of standing, they pushed out a streetcar to use as a chair. For some unknown reason, gunshots suddenly rang out, causing chaos. As a result, workers Wang A-si and Li Fugen were seriously injured on the spot, and their lives are in danger. More than a dozen others were slightly injured and have all been sent to Renji Shanghai Hospital, etc., for treatment. Your newspaper's report that the injuries were caused by a bomb is inaccurate. Please correct it according to this letter to avoid misunderstandings. To the Editor of Shen Bao, from the Shanghai First District Water and Electricity Industry Workers' Union, November 19, 1932.</p>

<p>— Bi</p>
<p>│All Depends on Dissatisfaction│</p>
<p>Coming out of school, the place to eat is still not settled, and needing three copper coins for pocket money requires digging into the pockets of one's parents. At that time, the plan was just to find a boss and receive a monthly salary of ten dollars, which would be very satisfying. After waiting for a year and a half, relying on the spirits of one's ancestors in heaven, one actually found a job with a monthly salary of thirty dollars, which was such a joyful thing. But at the end of the month, seeing other people's colorful banknotes, stacked one on top of another, going into their pockets, while oneself had worked hard for a month but only had three thin bills, one couldn't swallow this feeling. Therefore, one had to ask for help from relatives and friends to seek better employment. After the eating problem was solved, the first major problem was to plan how to find a satisfactory wife. With this thought, one felt that other people were staying together in pairs, and after work they returned to their residence, the two small mouths talked and laughed, and on weekends and holidays, they cooked a few dishes to eat, which was so interesting. Without a wife, after work one returned to the residence alone, and at mealtime, one still had to go to a restaurant, and weekends and holidays were even more boring. Therefore, one didn't choose what to eat and just married a wife to try it out. But after a year of marriage, an ignorant child was born with a loud cry. At that time, half of the wife's love was taken away by the child. After work, one returned to the residence, the teacup was on the chair, and diapers were scattered all over the floor. Everything felt unpleasant. Therefore, one had to look for other thoughts outside, seeking spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>Once the rice bowl was settled and the sexual troubles were resolved, one again envied those who rode in cars and lived in Western-style houses. Being the same person, why did others live in Western-style houses while I lived in a pavilion building; why did others ride in cars while I limped on the road every day? So, spend ten dollars to buy a champagne, and rely on the spirits of one's ancestors in heaven, and win one or two hundred thousand silver dollars, and all the clothing, food, housing, and transportation problems are solved. But if one or two hundred thousand silver dollars really came into hand, would one no longer have any extravagant hopes? I cannot guarantee that.</p>
<p>It is said that society evolves in this way.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Madame Pawley's Clever Escape from the Bandit's Den <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Xinfo</p>
<p>│Deeply Understood the Thoughts and Weaknesses of the Chinese│</p>
<p>The case of British Mrs. Muriel Pawley being trapped in the bandit's den in Niuzhuang was the most sensational kidnapping case in recent years. Negotiations approached last month, and she was released. Yesterday, I met a Western friend, Mr. "Hude," who, when discussing the Pawley case, said that if Pawley and others (also Mr. Charles Corran) had not cleverly used their wits, they might have been killed. While detained in the bandit's den, although the food and drink were unclean, they were treated relatively well. However, they were threatened in every possible way, and the bandits often pretended to damage their bodies to scare them. The bandit leader, when in high spirits, even cut off one of her ears and minced it into meat paste. Mrs. Pawley not only spoke Chinese very fluently but also deeply understood the thoughts and weaknesses of the Chinese. Relying on this line of thought, she made constant efforts day and night and finally came up with a solution. She mustered her courage and told the bandit leader: "If we are killed, our ghosts will haunt you day and night, making sure you never have a peaceful day. Even worse, we will turn your ancestors and your descendants into turtles." While speaking, she wailed and cried, with extreme sorrow, and pretended to strike herself to commit suicide. The delicate cries of a weak woman were even more effective than the military force of a country. The bandits, seeing this situation, were moved and whispered to each other, greatly reducing the ransom. Within a few days, the negotiations were settled, and they went to redeem and release them without any difficulty.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Why Are You Afraid of Your Wife? <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chunfan</p>
<p>│The Cause of the Three Stages│</p>
<p>Being afraid of one's wife is not a talent unique to China; I am afraid that there are many in Europe and America as well. Why are you afraid of your wife? There are three stages of reasons, which I will record below:</p>
<p>Love; it is always good for husband and wife to be loving. The husband, in order to maintain the love between the two, complies with his wife in every way, as long as he can win her heart and avoid the inconvenience of quarreling.</p>
<p>Respect; When she sees that her husband can always be considerate of her feelings, she becomes even more spoiled! To avoid cracks in love, the man compromises. At this point, he has entered the stage of "respect."</p>
<p>Awe; Having entered the third stage, no matter how capable you are of killing thieves for thousands of miles, you cannot subdue her because rigidity cannot overcome softness. For example, a steel knife chopping soft silk cotton, no matter how much effort you use, you cannot cut it. Tang Liuru said: "Why be afraid of the ways of heaven, which are vague and distant? Why fear the ways of the earth, which are dark and obscure? What is to be feared is the person who is always watching over you!" The reader may ask if there is a way not to be afraid? I say there is, but I have to keep three parts of the secret.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Looking Down on People <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenyue</p>
<p>│Because of Class Inequality│</p>
<p>A blind person looks down on people because he cannot see them.</p>
<p>A bright-eyed person looking down on people is very surprising and also very painful?</p>
<p>A person from the city looks down on people when they go to the countryside, and a person wearing a long gown looks down on people in the home of a person wearing short clothes.</p>
<p>A rich person looks down on people when they go to the poor home of a person without money.</p>
<p>Rich people can freely insult poor people, and poor people dare not resist. Sometimes poor people criticize the wrongs of the rich, and the rich will rise up to resist with full force. This is also a scene of looking down on people, probably because of class inequality, which leads to this kind of looking down on people, the so-called "acting as if something is important," which is an award given to a group of people who look down on others?</p>
<p>How can we talk about justice in a society where people look down on others like this? How can we talk about equality?</p>
<p>Therefore, people who look down on others like this are the criminals who destroy justice and equality?</p>
<p>People who cherish equality will not destroy justice. People who destroy justice will definitely destroy public reason first. To protect justice and protect equality, we should overthrow those who violate justice by looking down on others!</p>
<p>However, the person wearing a long gown and the person wearing short clothes are the same person, and the person with money and the person without money are also the same person, so we should not look down on the poor. I really hope that the thought of looking down on people will disappear immediately.</p>

<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>Mu Liang said, "I don't feel particularly uncomfortable. After all, Shanghai is a big place, and you can spread out. If you get tired of staying at home, you can go outside to relax. Always being cooped up in a pigeon coop isn't the same thing." The young mistress of the Han family became impatient and first hummed a "hmph" from her nostrils, followed by, "It's not like you men. Once you go out, it's like a bird leaving its cage and never wanting to return. What interest do we women have unless we're watching a play, going to a restaurant, or strolling around an amusement park? It's lonely and bleak." Mu Liang plastered his face with a smile and said, "Don't complain. Tomorrow, I'll accompany you to go around." The young mistress of the Han family still said weakly, "Do you have time? I don't believe it." Mu Liang said lazily, "These past few days have been extremely tiring. We're used to Suzhou and can't stay up late. When it gets bright, how can we still sleep? If we keep playing, we'll get sick soon."</p>
<p>The young mistress of the Han family deliberately teased him, "Would you be tired if you had a woman accompanying you?"</p>
<p>Mu Liang said:</p>
<p>"Do you know what kind of fun we're having?"</p>
<p>"Who knows!" The young mistress of the Han family didn't have any smile on her face and said lightly, "It's just one hundred and eighty-one, a small garden, or the Eight Immortals Bridge."</p>
<p>"No! No!" We go dancing. Dancing is more interesting than gambling or prostitution. It's a pity that it's too late and too tiring." "Buy one and dance at home. It'll be comfortable and free," said the young mistress of the Han family, and then burst into laughter. Who knew that these words would strike Mu Liang's heart. Not long ago, he chased away a concubine, and now he wants to get another one, which would inevitably be ridiculed by her. Although he was sure that she had no ability to stop him, the more docile she was, the more embarrassed he was to hide it from her. Moreover, during a time of national crisis, during a time of refuge, it was even more embarrassing to talk about this matter. It was rare for her to bring it up first, so he had an opportunity. Therefore, he was very excited, and his two ambitious eyes were filled with smiles, staring brightly at the young mistress of the Han family and saying:</p>
<p>"Shanghai women are difficult to handle. Do you think it's as easy as when I was getting Ai Gu?"</p>
<p>"Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it."</p>
<p>"There's a dancer in the dance hall who's really good. A round face, plump and tender, like a freshly ripe jade dew honey peach. Her graceful figure is more flexible than a water snake. People say that a modern woman's butt is 'four nothings,' but I say her whole body is 'four nothings.' Even her words are elastic. People say that a woman's two eyes are electric, but I say her thirty-six thousand pores are all electric..."</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market showed a slight improvement, but the increase was minimal. Some retail investors were resisting short selling, causing the market to exhibit a slightly tight and upward trend, but actual demand remained sluggish. It was found that only 280 bales of spot yarn were bought by various parties throughout the day, a rare occurrence in recent times. Therefore, most people are inclined to sell. In summary, spot yarn sales are too low, and the market is in a dismal state.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Firmness in Near-Month Cotton <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, but American cotton has fallen again. This is because shipments from various routes have been scarce, and there is a shortage of spot cotton on the market, with prices higher than futures by one or two taels. This situation has been reported in this newspaper before. As for a certain manufacturer selling a large amount, it currently seems cheaper to buy for short covering than to ship in cotton from elsewhere. Therefore, buying to cover short positions has caused the market to rise this month. However, spot sales are clearer than yesterday, and the yarn market remains sluggish, restraining the cotton market.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Standard (Zheng Biao) Up 3.5 Qian</p>
<p>Before the market opened, American cotton fell again, and market sentiment was still calm. However, as the delivery period for this month approached, retail investors increased prices by one qian. In the afternoon, more people bought near-month contracts to cover short positions, and prices for each month rose by 3.5 qian. The total turnover for the day was 59,600 dan. Yi Chang sold 2,800 dan, Chang Ji sold 2,600 dan, Yuan Da sold 4,200 dan, Yi Feng sold 2,200 dan, and Shen Chang sold 2,600 dan. Xin Cheng bought 2,500 dan, Da Fu bought 2,000 dan, Da Feng bought 2,000 dan, Chang Feng bought 1,000 dan, and Sen Kang bought 1,000 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm initially due to buying by traders, but then weakened due to profit-taking and hedging in the South. Futures fell by 5 to 7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. English cotton futures fell by 1-2 points, and spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 4 points. Indian cotton was firm initially due to buying by Japanese traders, but then softened due to rising exchange rates.

<p>New York, 18th: A report on the cotton market for the week states that raw cotton prices fell last week due to thin supply and the characteristic roll-over of December futures. Brokers connected to Japanese traders have been buying. European demand has shifted into a decline. Most are awaiting developments in the war debt issue. The weather has turned cold, delaying cotton harvests in the northern and northwestern cotton belts. However, in general, this year's cotton harvest is mostly complete, except for a small portion. According to the U.S. Cotton Office, if the current favorable weather continues, there may be a slight increase in the Texas harvest. The total harvest for the entire cotton belt this season is estimated to be 12 million bales. Attached is a summary of American cotton statistics for the weekend (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>▲ In South Shanghai Yesterday, Over a Dozen Inland Boats Arrived</p>
<p>In the morning, there was a large number of people at the market, and the shops slightly increased their inventories. As a result, Suzhou-Tongxiang goods rose by 2.5 jiao, and early and late rice each increased by 1 jiao. Foreign Dujian rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the opening price was set.</p>
<p>▲ In Xinzha Yesterday, Thirteen or Fourteen Boats Arrived on the West Road</p>
<p>The urban and rural sales market saw activity, and Kunshan rice suddenly rose by 2 jiao. Bo rice merchants slightly moved, and prices rose by 1.5 jiao. Tongbian rice changed subtly, neither good nor bad. The total daily opening volume was around 4,000 dan.</p>

<p>│ │Quanzhou Continues to Actively Purchase... Supply Arrives Continuously│ │</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained flat and soft. Local merchants were generally uninterested. Later, Chen Saigon rice of 700 bales was purchased from this street at a price of only 8 yuan. The rice quality was slightly better than the previous shipment, but the price was the same. The market outlook was even softer. Ke Xian rice continued to arrive, and more was being loaded for shipment. Inventories were gradually increasing. The market was initially watching for a soft trend, but yesterday, southern merchants showed great interest in purchasing, resulting in a total turnover of around 4,000. In addition to the Fuzhou merchants purchasing nearly 1,000 bales, new Quanzhou merchants arrived in the market to inquire and immediately purchased it. About 3,000 bales of Gan and Xiang Xian rice were sold, allowing the market to stand firm.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Flour Market Enters a Firm Trend in the Afternoon <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for each month showed an initial flat and then stable trend. Because the price of foreign wheat fell by another one or two jiao, the market atmosphere was flat at the beginning. However, after the second session, because there were very few sales, guest merchants had transactions, and floating shorts were also gradually covered. Therefore, the market rebounded and became firm. Until the afternoon market opened, the near-term months were because the Yingkou merchants had quite a lot of transactions, and Fufeng's short-covering of this month was presumably due to the need for spot goods and had not stopped, so the market sentiment recovered. As for the distant months, it was rumored that Australian wheat prices had been set, and due to exchange rate factors, the prices were called up by two or three points, but there were still few problems with setting orders. Only outsiders inevitably saw the price set. As a result, this month rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, December rose by 2 fen, January rose by 1 fen, February rose by 1.25 fen, March rose by 0.7 fen, and April rose by 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Near-Term Wheat Rises by 3 Fen <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>│Far-Month Trends Flat Due to Foreign Wheat│</p>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a near-stable and far-flat trend. This month, because the supply of spot wheat was limited and the factory's appetite was still good, and there were not many chips in the exchange, the market was easily shaken as soon as there was a need. However, the distant months showed a flat trend due to foreign wheat. As a result, this month rose by 3 fen compared to the previous day, December rose by 3 fen, January fell by a small 1 fen, February rose by a large 1 fen, and March and April remained unchanged. Spot transactions were still rare, and only parcels were not opened.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Market Sentiment Improves <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>│Up 2.5 Fen│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's sentiment improved as the premium (biaojin) repeatedly increased. The guild's first board price for No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was 14 taels, 8 qian, 3 fen, and 7.5 li. As outgoing stocks gradually decreased, it rose to 14 taels, 8 qian, and 5 fen, with a total increase of 2.5 fen before and after. No. 18 medium sand white sugar was 14 taels, No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 14 taels and 3 qian. New goods under the Dachang name were 14 taels, 6 qian to 6.25 fen. No. 8 Dutch red high-quality goods were 11 taels and 7 qian. No. 10 Dutch red old goods, light-colored oil-wrapped sugar, were 11 taels and 7 qian. Because they can be used to dilute foreign sugar, they were quite popular. As for Taikoo refined sugar, there were continued openings yesterday. B mark was 16 taels and 5 fen, CW mark was 15 taels and 8 qian, DY mark was 15 taels and 3 qian, HX mark was 15 taels and 1 qian, with little fluctuation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant silk market in this port still showed no improvement. Although there were white factory telegrams from Lyon and England to Shanghai, the number was only thirty or forty bales each, and they were spot transactions with no price increases. The attitude of various manufacturers was passive.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sales of needle-shaped and eyebrow-shaped green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other routes continued to be smooth. British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, Fushi, Yuansheng, and other firms had purchase interest. There were also telegrams from foreign countries requesting supply. Therefore, the market for needle-shaped eyebrows and elegant eyebrows trended firm. However, the stocks were nearly exhausted, and supply could not meet demand. As for the Zhenmei category, there were no large transactions throughout the city. The Russian Xieyi Association had little sales of Gongxi green tea.</p>
<p>However, firms such as Jinlong and Yongxing, seeing that tea prices were low, were eager to take the opportunity to search for goods in preparation for re-manufacturing needle-shaped eyebrows, elegant eyebrows, and other patterns to be transported to Morocco for sale.</p>

<p>In previous years, the sales of mid-to-low-grade small-sized white coal from Liu Jiang were relatively strong in the winter because many of the water-filled coals in the major buildings in this port used it. Unexpectedly, this year, most users of water-filled coal have switched to using bituminous coal or Shanxi coal. As a result, the sales of Liu Jiang small-sized coal have become stagnant, and the market price has also fallen. Yesterday, the market price was only 5.5 taels per ton.</p>

<p>Hardware transactions were still good yesterday. Over 600 dan of No. 16 to No. 20 new lead wires were opened for sale. However, because the market was stingy with goods, prices soared. The price per dan was 14 taels, which was 2.5 qian higher than before. No. 21 to No. 25 were still estimated at 18 taels, but there were few transactions. There were an unusual number of inquiries for American white iron, and the market was unusually strong. Among them, No. 26 was the most popular among all goods, and the market price per dan could be estimated at 18 taels and 2.5 qian, which was the highest price in more than ten years. No. 24 was 14 taels and 5 qian, No. 28 was 16 taels and 5 qian, and 48 sheets were 15 taels and 5 qian. It was found that over 270 or 280 dan were opened for sale yesterday. However, because the overseas price of this product was unusually firm, the market price in this port also showed no sign of falling. There were transactions for No. 24 to No. 28 white iron tiles, but there were no price increases or decreases. British white iron seemed to be easing yesterday, mainly because customers who had purchased goods last time had not yet sold them all. There was also a shortage of spot small-sized nails, so many merchants were interested in them. People estimated the price at 3 fen at 13 taels and 5 qian, 4 fen at 13 taels and 5 fen, 12 taels and 5 qian, and 6 fen at 12 taels. Recently, the overseas telegrams for bamboo joint steel bars have continuously raised prices, so the standard in this port has also risen rapidly. For example, 3 fen, 7 fen, and 1 inch all require 77 or 78 taels, and patterned steel can also be opened to 70 taels. The factory prices of this factory's Yuan nails have also discussed raising prices due to the high cost of raw materials. Each barrel of Beisi has risen to 6 taels and 1 qian, and exports are 6 taels and 5 qian. However, actual transactions are affected by this. Only 700 or 800 barrels have been opened for sale in recent days. There have been fewer inquiries for black iron sheets recently, and the market is also more sluggish. 3.6 feet are 8 taels and 5 qian, and 3.7 feet are 9 taels. The transactions for tinplate have been slightly less than before recently, but the market price has always been maintained and has not fallen. British goods of 90 pounds are 11 taels and 2.5 qian, 100 pounds are 12 taels, American goods are 14 taels and 5 qian, 100 pounds are 16 taels, 200 pounds of regular goods are 32 taels, secondary goods are 22 taels, 35 pounds are 39 taels and 5 qian, and 180 pounds of British iron are 22 taels and American goods are 27 taels.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>It's truly annoying to make everyday talks without a topic. Some topics are too dangerous to do, some topics are not worth doing, and some topics are unnecessary. When I woke up this morning, I flipped through the newspaper again. What was reported was the eve of the League of Nations meeting and the outbreak of the war in the Black Province. Thinking of the loyal and patriotic volunteers who were resisting the violence in the Eastern Province in this freezing weather, I wished I could fly there and help them kill the enemy. Then I saw the telegram from President Song ordering General Su Bingwen not to harm Japanese prisoners. President Song's benevolence and reputation were also rare. So I put the newspaper aside and didn't look at it.</p>
<p>I was very bored, so I pulled a book from the bookshelf. When I opened it, it turned out to be a copy of Zuo Zhuan. I flipped through it casually and read the passage where Duke Xiang of Song fought with the Chu people in Hong. Duke Xiang said, "In ancient times, one did not inflict a second wound, nor capture the gray-haired. The armies of ancient times did not take advantage of narrow terrain. Even though I am the remnant of a defeated country, I will not attack those who are not in formation." I laughed at Duke Xiang of Song for being so fond of practicing virtue, and for being called a hegemon for a time. Then I threw Zuo Zhuan aside and pulled a Bible from the bookshelf. Suddenly, I saw the passage, "If someone strikes my left cheek, I will offer my right cheek to him." I deeply sighed at the greatness of Jesus' teachings, but since I am not a Christian, what's the point of looking at it? So I put it aside without reading it. Still bored, I pulled out a copy of Zizhi Tongjian. Again, I saw a passage, "Lou Shide of the Tang Dynasty, whose younger brother was appointed governor of Daizhou, resigned from his post. Shide taught him to be patient. His younger brother said, 'From now on, if someone spits in my face, I will simply wipe it off.' Shide said, 'If someone spits in your face, it is because they are angry with you. Wiping it off goes against their intention. It is better to let it dry on its own.'" When I saw this, I couldn't help but admire the magnanimity of the ancients, which was the same essence as the teachings of Jesus, as if they were in complete agreement, which was quite remarkable.</p>
<p>I was quite pleased after reading the above two passages, so I continued to flip through it. I saw that "When Yang Zaisi was prime minister, Zhang Tongxiu, the vice minister of ceremonies, was the brother of Yi Zhizhi. Once, during a banquet, he joked to Zaisi, 'Secretary Yang, your face looks like a Korean.' Zaisi happily cut paper and put on a headscarf, reversed his purple robe, and performed a Korean dance." I secretly laughed at how there were such shameless people in ancient times, and I was greatly disappointed. I put the Tongjian back on the shelf.</p>
<p>I thought that I shouldn't read proper history books, and that I should look at novels instead. I casually flipped through a copy of Romance of the Western Chamber, and I was quite pleased. I thought that if I were to read Romance of the Western Chamber, I would definitely have to eat wheat porridge while reading it. I also thought that Jin Shengtan's comments on Romance of the Western Chamber were the best, so I might as well take a look at his comments. It happened to be the "torturing the beauty" section, which said, "I saw two scholars arguing about a principle in the street. They were both red-faced and furious, as if they couldn't coexist, but they still cupped their hands high and bowed low, using words like 'zhi hu zhe ye' in every sentence. Their words were thorny, and it seemed like they would never stop. Suddenly, a strong man came along, waved his arm, and shouted in the middle to resolve the situation. Isn't that satisfying!" Just as I was reading to the exciting part, I suddenly remembered that I had to make a talk today, and I didn't have a topic yet. So I wrote down the books I had just seen here in a messy manner, which can also be considered a talk.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Writing Worries About My Homeland, Which is Full of Thorns <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was invited to a banquet by a friend, where I met an old acquaintance, Mr. So-and-so. Talking about the endless civil strife, he showed me four heptasyllabic poems he had written, titled "Writing Worries About My Homeland, Which is Full of Thorns." After reading them, I felt a tear in every word, and I couldn't help but feel sad. I asked him if he could publish them in the newspaper as a way to appeal for help. He said that he deeply wished to think about the disaster victims in his hometown, but after traveling to Shanghai, he had suffered misfortune because of his writing, so he dared not offend others with his worrying works again. I said, "Then how about not publishing your real name?" He finally agreed. Therefore, I respectfully follow his instructions and transcribe his original work as follows, hoping that the reader will understand it.</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains of the old country are like a game of chess,</p>
<p>The news that comes is extremely sad.</p>
<p>The shadow of a snake in the cup frightens dreams,</p>
<p>The rumors in the market cast the most suspicion.</p>
<p>When the bandits are setting fires and looting,</p>
<p>How many lives can we cultivate to see peace?</p>
<p>Crying in Changsha is of no use,</p>
<p>My heart is cluttered and confused.</p>
<p>I heard that the beacon fires are blazing in the wild pavilions,</p>
<p>I can't bear to watch people drunk while I alone stay awake.</p>
<p>The state of chaos is like the Tianbao era,</p>
<p>Protecting the people relies on the spirit of the land.</p>
<p>The murderous aura suddenly rises, whitening the suburbs,</p>
<p>I fear to see the burn marks on the distant green mountains.</p>
<p>I scratch my head in vain, seeking a safe plan,</p>
<p>But I'm willing to let my floating life be drunk in green.</p>
<p>The military letters from Yu and Shaanxi are too tense,</p>
<p>The Yuan Rong's small team goes out to the suburbs in a hurry.</p>
<p>They don't hesitate to deprive Qin of the head of the quail,</p>
<p>And it is difficult for me to firm my wooden intestines against the snow.</p>
<p>The bandits are rising in droves like thorns,</p>
<p>And the supply of the mighty army is exhausted.</p>
<p>The conscripts ask about the road ahead with hardship,</p>
<p>But the ever-changing situation makes them lament the unknown.</p>
<p>The fine guests gather at the banquet to discuss the bandit atmosphere,</p>
<p>And the four sides of the old mountain are filled with yellow clouds.</p>
<p>The villagers expect me to return in vain,</p>
<p>And I am ashamed to face you, for I have no way to save the disaster.</p>
<p>The remnant chrysanthemums are proud of the frost, their bones clear,</p>
<p>And the migratory geese cry at the moon, regretting leaving the flock.</p>
<p>I cry out in the wilderness with disheveled hair,</p>
<p>Why not let me be the commander?</p>

<h3 id="e221">On Coal Gas Poisoning and First Aid <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>During the cold winter months, it is a great pleasure to warm oneself around a stove or to place one in the bedroom. However, one should also be careful, otherwise one could not only burn one's clothes, but also cause death. This is not a lie. If you just take a look at the newspapers from last year or the winter before last, you can prove that what I say is true.</p>
<p>How exactly can coal gas cause death? This is a question worth studying. Originally, firewood or coal, under the influence of high temperature in the stove, undergoes a chemical reaction and combines with the oxygen in the air to become a colorless, odorless, and tasteless carbon dioxide gas. During the combination, it also releases a large amount of heat, so the remaining carbon also combines with oxygen due to the heat. This cycle continues until all the carbon is completely oxidized. The impurities in the fuel remain as ashes.</p>
<p>Carbon gasification (i.e., combustion) requires a large amount of oxygen and releases a larger amount of carbon dioxide. If the ventilation equipment is perfect, then there is no problem. Fresh air can enter from the outside as much as possible, driving out the useless dioxy-</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>-de carbon. However, sometimes, in order to prevent the spread of heat, all the windows are tightly closed. In this way, all the oxygen in the room gradually decreases due to oxidation, while the useless carbon dioxide gradually increases. Everyone knows that living things cannot live without oxygen. Although carbon dioxide does not contain a trace of toxic substances, it can also make people in the room gradually feel dizzy. If you don't open the windows at this time to let fresh air in (assuming the people in the room are already fast asleep), then all the living things will suffocate and die.</p>
<p>But there is also one biggest reason, which is that the carbon under the stove oxidizes into carbon dioxide and rises, passing through the heated carbon at the top. Because of the lack of oxygen, it is reduced to carbon monoxide. The blue flame emitted from the stove is caused by this reaction. This carbon monoxide, although also a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas like carbon dioxide, is not as gentle as carbon dioxide. It has strong toxicity. If the air contains one part of carbon monoxide per eight hundred parts, it can kill the people in the room within thirty minutes. This is because when it is inhaled into the lungs, it can combine with red blood cells</p>
<p>-to form a cherry-red substance. This substance cannot distribute nutrients to the body, so that all life is completely stopped and leads to death. Think about how scary this is. In people who die from coal poisoning, if the whole body is already purple, that is evidence that the blood has already clotted and all the blood vessels in the whole body are blocked. In this way, there is no cure. If it only appears cyan or slightly purple, you should immediately put him in a place with good air circulation, rub his whole body with a cold, damp cloth to clear the stagnant blood, and boil one tael of peach kernels, five qian of枳實, and five qian of萊服子 into a soup. Separately, use one tael of raw rhubarb to filter the juice, add it, pry open the teeth, and slowly pour it in. He will recover in about half a day. For mild poisoning, just mash a lot of radish juice, or fresh pear or lotus root juice, and pour it in a place with good air circulation. You can wake up in less than twenty minutes of poisoning. People who usually burn coal stoves often eat radishes, which can also relieve the coal toxins they are usually exposed to. Dried persimmon not only relieves coal toxins, but also prevents throat diseases next spring, so you should also eat it often.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Room Number Thirteen <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>—Lianlian</p>
<p>It was the eve of a holiday, just when the cold wind was beating against the sparse curtains; In dormitory number thirteen of × School’s ×× Building, eight young men were playing poker by candlelight after the lights were turned off. In the corridor, there were also two young men silently smoking cigarettes and pacing back and forth. Sometimes they listened attentively to the sounds from downstairs, and sometimes they stared blankly out the glass window. Clearly, they seemed like guards hired to report any trouble.</p>
<p>× School wasn’t really that strict, and the school authorities especially neglected what went on in the dormitories. It wasn’t really a big deal that they wanted to gamble, but just to be safe, they couldn’t help but worry a little. Although in fact, the dormitory supervisor was nowhere to be found that night, it was still reassuring to gamble daringly.</p>
<p>Because tomorrow was a holiday, there were especially many people going home that night. Although the clinking of coins and the sounds of laughter in room number thirteen weren’t very loud, they seemed loud because it was quiet. One classmate who was loud and boisterous made it seem even louder: "Three King Ks, Ace, AQ, Two Pairs, two dollars find three dollars..." Everyone was excited and cheerful, and the smoke from the cigarettes made the room hazy, even spreading to the next room. The whole environment was one of intoxication, indulgence, corruption, and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Something unexpected really did happen. At this late hour, the dormitory supervisor, Mr. ×, actually returned, reeking of alcohol. The lookouts could have seen him in theory, but because it was already past 11 o'clock, they didn't think that Mr. × would come back to school, so they joined the game and gambled intently. How would they know that Mr. × was coming upstairs? And so, a tense scene was about to begin.</p>
<p>Mr. × was drunk and tired, and he originally had no intention of catching anyone gambling. However, after he went to bed, the clinking of coins disturbed his sleep, so he got angry and decided to get up and catch them. However, the young students were still very alert. As soon as they heard Mr. ×'s footsteps approaching, one of them opened the door and looked outside. When he saw what was happening, he slammed the door shut tightly. The candles were blown out, and the clinking of coins and the sounds of laughter ceased. The ten of them all went to bed and pretended to be asleep silently. When Mr. × opened the door and came in to check, he couldn't see anything except for the thick, lingering smoke, which made him want to choke. He was extremely puzzled. He opened the bed curtains and checked them one by one, but they were all sleeping soundly like pigs. He knew that they were up to something, but since they weren't gambling anymore, he was happy to go back to his room and sleep peacefully. But these little guys were not to be trifled with. They thought that he had deliberately made things difficult for them, so they had to play a trick on Mr. ×, so that he wouldn't do it again in the future. Xiao Jin, nicknamed Pan Jinlian, then came up with a clever plan, which was: "The little ones use a little trick, and the teacher falls through the door."</p>
<p>Less than ten minutes after Mr. × returned to his room, a sudden fire alarm sounded in dormitory number thirteen, followed by two loud banging sounds on the washbasin. Mr. × was flustered and hurried out to take a look, but the outside was empty. Where was there any fire? However, since those in number thirteen were making a nuisance of things again, and they were going to make it so that he wouldn't be able to sleep all night, he had to go into number thirteen again and try to persuade them not to mess around. Unexpectedly, after entering the doorway, he wasn't careful and tripped over a bamboo pole that had been placed across the entrance, and he fell straight to the ground, knocking him senseless. However, strangely enough, the ten students in the bed mechanically got up one by one and helped him up, patted him down, and said solicitously to him: "If we had known that the teacher was coming to inspect the room, we wouldn't have gone to the trouble of setting up these petty defense measures. Mr. ×, we're really sorry!"</p>
<p>Mr. × shook his head, sighed, and staggered back to his room, muttering to himself, "I wonder when I'll be able to endure the hardships of this thankless job." In room number thirteen, a burst of laughter rang out, along with a sentence: "Jin's ingenious plan has brought peace to the world, allowing the teacher to fall right through the door."</p>
<p>Casual Talk</p>
<h3 id="e223">For the Sake of "Vases" <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Today, we should take off the tinted, patriarchal, and feudal glasses of tradition. We should acknowledge that men and women are absolutely equal in any position, especially in professions. If men can do something, women should also be given the opportunity and trusted to do it. In this day and age, who can deny this?</p>
<p>In recent years, women's professions in China have finally sprouted a little bit. In schools and hospitals, they have already given us considerable achievements. Gradually, they have also appeared in offices. Unfortunately, they quickly gained the reputation of being nothing more than decorative "vases"! ...... I am very suspicious of people in society, why are they so bored, with nothing to do after they've eaten their fill? Isn't this insulting women's personality and ruthlessly stamping out these little seedlings of women's professions?</p>
<p>A friend told me, "The female staff in the office simply don't know how to do things. The boss hires them just to decorate and regulate the heavy, dull, and monotonous atmosphere in the office, giving the male staff excitement and increasing work efficiency. They dress in bright colors and pose like models, aren't they just vases? Women don't live up to expectations, who can they blame for insulting them?"</p>
<p>Because of the two words "vases," I was really indignant for quite a while, I often cursed those boring, slanderous, and vulgar things with all my might!</p>
<p>Soon, Miss Xu, a young female staff member, also came to the next-door section ×× of our company's office. Her classmates all said that she was a "modern girl"... beautiful, a modern social butterfly, many young people are chasing her! As for her duties, because we are separated by a wall, I have never figured it out. Some people say that she can't even write clearly, and she is used to answer the phone, it's just a vase.</p>
<p>Our small editorial office, filled with a poor and sour atmosphere, has always been cold and boring. Colleagues all wear old copper-rimmed glasses and shake their heads all day long, humming and chanting non-stop. Since the modern girl came to the next door, the warm and smiling air has penetrated through the partition and invaded our editorial office. At first, I felt that it was new, fresh, and a bit inexplicably interesting; but gradually, it caused great annoyance and unease! The telephone rings madly all day long, less than a minute apart. The crisp, delicate, singing-like tone is absorbed by our hearing nerve sentence by sentence, and our thoughts are messed up. As a result, our heads are dizzy, our legs are swollen, we can't write a word, the boss has a deadline for the manuscript, and we are so anxious that we scratch our heads and ears, humming "Brain is dizzy, eyes are blurred, and mouth is difficult to speak!" So, we began to curse the vases... Vases, you are unwilling to be self-respecting, and you willingly become vulgar things!</p>
<p>A friend asked me: "Who is insulting women? You should recognize the 'vase', right? People don't eat their fill and specialize in boredom! You wholeheartedly speak for women, but women themselves don't live up to expectations, what else is there to say?......"</p>
<p>Good Business</p>
<h3 id="e224">A Thousand Percent Profit <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Dou</p>
<p>Probably about a week ago. One night, Mr. Chen and I were walking idly on Jing'an Temple Road. We talked about national affairs and our respective life problems.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mr. Chen abandoned me and started talking intimately with another friend. Then he beckoned me to come over and introduced me. I am not good at socializing, and I really lack the art of social etiquette. However, that friend was just the opposite of me. He asked about my name, origin, occupation, and address in great detail, as if we had known each other for a long time.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I almost forgot that friend's name. I only knew that that friend was from ×× County, Zhejiang Province, and is now working as a police officer in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, I suddenly received a red invitation, which was forwarded by Mr. Chen. I thought Mr. Chen had something happy to celebrate. When I opened it, I was confused. After a long time, I remembered the police officer I met on Jing'an Temple Road. It turned out that it was his son's "soup cake celebration," inviting me to eat soup cake, which was really polite. But looking closely, there was a line of small characters at the back, which read "Banquet is held at the ancestral home in ×× County, Zhejiang Province." I thought, my luck for eating is not good. Such a long way to go, taking a boat and taking a car, just for a meal, it's not worth it.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Mr. Chen ran to my place and asked me if I had received a red invitation. I replied to him, "Sorry, I am a person who believes in the principle of not giving gifts in return. First, I don't have money to give gifts, and second, giving this kind of gift is meaningless. Moreover, this is obviously doing a good business with a thousand percent profit, and I don't advocate giving it even more."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen smiled apologetically at me and said, "Then I'm sorry to you. I already sent a four-dollar gift this morning, with the names of both of us. I'm here to inform you now, but I didn't expect you to be!!"</p>
<p>I had no choice but to take out two silver dollars and return them to Mr. Chen. I said with a smile: "Then, Lao Chen, he's holding the banquet at his ancestral home in ×× County, Zhejiang Province, are you going or not?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen shook his head, smiled, and ran away. I thought: this good business with a thousand percent profit was finally done successfully by that friend.</p>

<h3 id="e225">A Dissertation on Scarlet Fever <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Hua</p>
<p>Scarlet fever is an acute infectious disease. Anyone with a little medical knowledge can understand it. However, it is really difficult to prevent the spread of scarlet fever. Because the spread of scarlet fever is unbelievably rapid. There are often cases of mutual infection along the household and in the whole area. Some even die in the evening after developing the disease in the morning, or die in the morning after developing the disease in the evening. The sudden and premature death is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>The Origin of Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>This disease rarely occurs in autumn and summer, less often in spring, and most often in winter. The winter climate should have been cold, but it is warm instead. The Inner Canon says, "If the climate is not as it should be, it will brew evil epidemics." The throat opens into the lungs, and the pharynx opens into the stomach. The throat and pharynx are the portals of the lungs and stomach. The evil enters the lungs and stomach through the mouth and nose. Severe cold binds the exterior, and epidemic poison accumulates in the interior. It steams up in the lung and stomach meridians. The fire of the liver and gallbladder takes advantage of the situation to ascend. Thus, scarlet fever is formed.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>The symptoms of scarlet fever are high fever, red face, soreness throughout the body, and rotten throat, making swallowing difficult. The rash first appears on the head and face, and then on the chest and ribs. This is the correct symptom of scarlet fever. If there is no sweat after treatment, and the rash cannot penetrate and present a depressed appearance, with a foul voice and rapid breathing, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Differential Diagnosis of Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>There are differences between epidemic throat, diphtheria, throat wind, and throat blockage. There are differences between true rash, wind rash, red rash, and measles rash. Single throat symptoms without rash, or single rash without throat symptoms, cannot be called scarlet fever. Scarlet fever is a kind of epidemic evil, which cannot be compared with ordinary throat and rash symptoms. Only when rash and throat symptoms appear at the same time can it be called scarlet fever.</p>
<p>Children and Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>Children's bodies are not fully developed, and their internal organs are delicate and weak, making them susceptible to seasonal evils. However, there are also cases of single rash, with slight sore throat, but no rot. This is due to latent heat in the womb, which is triggered by seasonal evils, and is not contagious scarlet fever. The symptoms are generally fever, cough, irritability, and nausea. If throat rot is seen, and the rash is faintly visible, it is scarlet fever. It is urgent to seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>Prevention of Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>Scarlet fever is a very dangerous disease, as detailed above. Now, I will briefly write down the prevention methods below. I think readers will also be happy to hear them. If neighbors or relatives have scarlet fever, do not enthusiastically visit them. If family members have scarlet fever, they must also be isolated in separate rooms. All the patient's food utensils, clothing, and other items must not be mixed together. Often decoct radish in water as a substitute for tea. Olives are also acceptable. The indoor air must always be circulating. The stool must always be kept smooth.</p>
<p>Treatment of Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>At the beginning of scarlet fever, it is necessary to quickly induce sweating. Therefore, first use the sweating method, then use the clearing method, or use the purging method. It must be divided into three stages: initial, middle, and late. In qi, in ying, or more in qi, or more in ying. The pulse is uncertain. The diagnosis should be accurate. If there is any inappropriateness, it is often a fact. My ancestor, Gong, had 20 years of experience in scarlet fever. The scarlet fever he treated was all effective. Now, I record the various prescriptions prescribed by my ancestor below, so that readers can follow the map and find something to refer to.</p>
<p>(1) Antitoxin and Rash-Transmitting Decoction</p>

<h3 id="e226">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Yi</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>A persistent cough that does not heal and exhibits symptoms of fatigue is called pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Causes</p>
<p>There are three causes of pulmonary tuberculosis: one is due to external influences, one is due to internal injuries, and one is due to heredity. Those due to external influences are caused by catching a cold or being forced by cold weather, and the lung qi is threatened. If it does not heal for a long time, it will turn into pulmonary tuberculosis. Those due to internal injuries are caused by working all day long, not being able to enjoy sunlight and fresh air sufficiently, and the food is lacking in nourishment, so the lungs are gradually damaged and lose their resistance, and it turns into pulmonary tuberculosis. Those due to heredity are caused by the lung tuberculosis virus of the parents being transmitted to the child's body. As the child's body grows, the virus also deepens. Often, they die at the age of eighteen or nineteen.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>The symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are divided into three stages. The first stage: cough and chest pain. The second stage: cough and chest pain with shortness of breath and hemoptysis. The third stage: cough and chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, flushed cheeks, and foul voice, all symptoms are present.</p>
<p>Pathology</p>
<p>Western medicine discusses pulmonary tuberculosis, focusing on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is shaped like a thin rod, about one-third the length of a red blood cell. It has a fatty or waxy substance on the outside. When I read Chao Yuanfang's "Origins of Diseases," it also says that lung worms are like silkworms. It can be seen that there is no doubt that lung tuberculosis has worms. However, since lung tuberculosis is a kind of bacteria, the bacteria in the patient's sputum are left in the dust and spread with the wind. Everyone has the opportunity to be infected with pulmonary tuberculosis. Why do those who are sick get sick, and those who are not sick never get sick? This is because the human body's resistance is strong, and the virus is not easy to sneak in. Try to see the symptoms of those who died of lung disease. It must be from shallow to deep, from gradual to severe. It will never be the case that once you have lung tuberculosis, the symptoms of the third stage will appear immediately.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>The most important treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis is cough, because the lungs' inhalation and exhalation have a certain normal state. If there is an obstacle in the lungs, the lung qi cannot follow the normal breathing, so it starts a counter-reaction and coughs frequently. However, the cough should also be observed for fierceness and gentleness. A fierce cough indicates a mild illness and can be treated with drugs that promote lung function. A gentle cough indicates a more serious illness and can be treated with products that clear the lungs and resolve phlegm, making it easier to expectorate the phlegm. If the cough shows symptoms such as hemoptysis, shortness of breath, foul voice, and bone steaming, it indicates that the deficiency has appeared. It is necessary to use large doses of products that tonify and purify the lungs to protect the vital energy. When the vital energy is restored, then circulate and regulate with products that clear, purify, and nourish the lungs, so that the virus is completely eliminated and it will heal on its own. If the vital energy has been lost in the third stage of lung disease and the spleen and stomach are also unable to digest, no matter how many wonderful methods there are, it will be difficult to hope for recovery.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Common Knowledge of Blood Diseases: A Series of Talks on Blood Diseases (1) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ji Hua</p>
<p>The human body's organization, from the outer skin and muscles to the inner bones and internal organs, all rely on blood for nourishment. If the blood is weak, the skin and muscles will be dry and rough, and the bones and internal organs will be cramped and hard. If we want a healthy body, how can it be like a tree without roots, and expect it to be lush and verdant? The ancient sages said that food enters the stomach, is steamed and transformed into liquid, which is transported upward by the lungs and distributed to the lungs. The lungs are in charge of distribution, sprinkling on the internal organs and moistening the skin and hair. When the liquid is full, it becomes blood. When the blood is full, it becomes flesh. It can be seen that liquid is the essence of food, and blood is brewed from the body fluids. But if there is no qi to supply its operation, then the circulation up and down, how can it be smooth? Therefore, in Chinese medical knowledge, there is a clear statement that qi is the commander of blood, and treating blood first treats qi. It is true that blood cannot flow by itself and must rely on qi to move it. Qi weakness causes blood stagnation. Qi deficiency causes blood loss. Qi reversal causes blood disorder. Qi forcing causes blood to run wild. Qi knotting causes blood coagulation. Qi rush causes blood to burst out. Therefore, qi is to blood as shrimp is to jellyfish. People with abundant qi and full blood have plump muscles and shiny faces. It is said that they are energetic and radiant. Using qi to make blood move, and blood to guard qi, using each other for each other, no disease can invade and no external feeling can Gong. The camp guard is peaceful, and the Yin and Yang are harmonious. It is a healthy body. If qi is exhausted and blood is weak, the dryness of hair and skin and the darkness of appearance are self-evident. Moreover, the face may be yellow and puffy, the muscles may be reduced, the actions may be panting, and the weakness may be powerless. There is little diet, and digestion is poor. Both stools are difficult, and dragons and thunder are easy to rebel. It is said that the internal organs are truly deficient and the resistance is weak. Even if there is no external trouble, there is also concern that changes will occur suddenly between the elbows and armpits.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are good at nourishing life must be good at nourishing their blood in order to maintain their health. If you want to nourish your blood, you must be good at regulating your qi. Clear qi, clear blood. Turbid qi, turbid blood. Decayed food, foul air, and those who mix into the qi will also escape into the blood. If the blood is not clear, all kinds of diseases will gather together. This is because there is less nourishing qi and more carbon gas. The Western theory says that venous blood cells are mostly purple and dark, and arterial blood cells are mostly bright red. Venous blood contains more carbon gas, and arterial blood contains more nourishing qi. There are also white blood cells that can eat the micro-bacteria that invade blood vessels, also known as phagocytes, which are extremely viscous in nature. I will not discuss them in detail here.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the blood in the human body absorbs nourishing qi and returns to the arteries. If there is more nourishing qi and less carbon gas, the blood will be pure and clean, and the body will be light and healthy. There is a possibility of avoiding disease. On the contrary, hoping for health and freedom from disease is impossible. However, the arrival of the disease is not an end. Confused talk of blood loss, anemia, and women's metrorrhagia, etc. Analyzed talk of many signs. But the outline of the discussion is no more than three causes. One day is external cause. External blood diseases mostly belong to Yang evil. The Yin is deficient first, and the wind, heat, dryness, and fire of the weather take advantage of the deficiency to invade. If it is forced to the lungs and stomach, and it goes to the clear path, it is nosebleed. If it goes to the turbid path, it is hematemesis, vomiting blood, etc. If it is forced to the intestines, the network qi is not stable, it is bloody dysentery, intestinal deviation, etc. The second day is internal cause. Internal blood diseases are nothing more than anger, depression, stimulating the liver, laboring the body and thinking bitterly, consuming the heart and spleen, indulging in desires to kill kidney Yin, and indulging in emotions to raise true fire. If the fire is inflamed above, the blood goes upward. If the fire is corrected below, the blood flows downward. The third day is neither internal nor external cause. Blood that is neither internal nor external cause is all due to improper diet and excessive labor. Mr. Ye Xiangyan said that smoking and spicy food release the lungs, and alcohol and food harm the stomach. The sun finally spins, and the evil fire is strong inside, as well as falling, beating, and working too hard, causing the blood vessels to rupture and the circulation to be off track. If it bursts upward, it is vomiting. If it flows downward, it is diarrhea. For women, it is collapse. The above are the outlines of the main points of argument. Enumerated separately. There are many items of symptoms. Listed at the bottom. In order to become the present. Fortunately, give me your teachings.</p>
