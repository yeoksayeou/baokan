<p>時評</p>
<h3>再論救農</h3>
<p>邇來米價慘跌。農村恐慌。朝野呼籲。救濟乏術治急。已不勝其艱鉅。是則整個農村之根本問題。其性質之嚴重。更可想而知。本報月刋前嘗邀集農村問題之專家集思廣議。其記事已載於月刋第四號。初不料米價之慘跌。似暴風狂雨之驟來。愈顯農村加緊崩潰之迅速也。</p>
<p>據郵局之調查。吾國農民佔全人口百分之七十二。居住鄉村之農民。約在三萬萬二千萬以上。就吾國統計設施之幼稚而言。其數字之不可靠。亦意中事。惟無論如何。吾國自古以農立國。農民實佔吾全國人民之大多數。故農民之疾苦。實可謂大多數人民之疾苦。誠如葉恭綽氏在本報月刋講談會之所言。[我國今日的農村問題。乃是全國經濟將要眞正破產的過程中所顯露出來的農村問題。］是則今日農村問題之嚴重。實爲全國經濟將瀕於破產之惡兆。而目前糧價慘跌所釀成之榖賤傷農的現象。亦僅爲斯一惡兆中所顯露之悲慘的象徵而已。</p>
<p>按米價慘跌之原因。論者已衆。外產糧食之流入。（如去年大批美麥之輸入）内地運輸之困難。地方需索之繁重。苛捐雜稅之剥削。農村金融之呆滯。高利貸之壓迫。土匪惡棍貪官汚曳之充塞等等。凡此種種確爲米價慘跌之因素苟再進一層觀察。亦即整個農村將瀕於破產之因素據海關之統計。上年我國輸入之糧食。計値二萬六千三百餘萬元之鉅。成爲吾國貿易入超中主要之部份。吾國農村經濟已進於直接受國際資本主義之宰割時期。而他方面都市經濟日趨集中。僅以上海一隅。計聞流資達五六萬萬元以上。近來上海之銀行事業。雖方興未艾。而就其實際除從事投機經營地產以外。幾無一有價値之服務可言。而内地之農民雖欲借三五分左右之高利貸亦不可得。以如斯畸形之現象。大勢所趨。惟有使吾勞苦之農民顚沛流離。老弱轉乎溝壑壯者鋌而走險。今復豐年賤收。榖賤病農。其情狀之險惡可以促國本之動搖。際斯外患緊逼。國難重重。農村經濟之崩必將加速整個民族危亡之程度。</p>
<p>是則處今日而言農村問題。已非社會之枝節問題。而爲政治之整個問題。救濟農村經濟之破產。亦即所以挽救國家民族危亡。故亟宜集中全國上下之心與力。外禦强寇内扶農村惟僅斯二點。已非易舉。况目前政治之紊亂。適爲農村問題嚴重之根因。不圖政治之上軌道。而僅急急於農村之救濟。在邏輯上實患有因果倒置之弊。且關於救濟農村之方策。無治標治本求諸專家言之諄諄。惟最大困難。乃在如何施行。更欲其如何施行而無阻。苟政治不上軌道。則一切皆爲幻滅。治標旣非長久之計。空言更無補於實際。故救濟農村之方案根本之根本。一言以蔽之。曰如何使政治得上軌道。　　今者魯難未已。川亂又起。東北旣瀹於滅亡。藏邊亦日就告急。而中樞團結未固。西南且示離心。然則在如斯散亂分崩碎裂之局面下。欲求政治之上軌道。戞乎其難。遑言救農哉。展念及斯不禁悲愴交集耳。要電</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚蟹爪喻  瞻廬　　在這蟹對菊的時候，我在酒樓中，遇見一位白鬚老者自得其樂的在剥取蟹肉吃：他左手執着一股蟹，右手拈着一節蟹爪，專把蟹爪做他剥取蟹肉的工具。　　剥取蟹肉的手　很敏捷，差不多用着韓昌黎所說的［爬羅剔抉］四字訣：無多時刻，已把蟹殼裏面轉彎抹角深藏隱匿的蟹肉，一古腦兒都剥取出來以供這位老先生的大嚼。他在吃在說：　　螃蟹螃蟹，你生了這般的利爪，却落在我的手裏做工具；應了一句［以子之矛攻子之盾］的古語，又應了一句［借你的拳頭撞你的嘴］的俗語。　　吃蟹本是很麻煩的，倘使没有你的蟹爪剥取你的蟹肉，處處者要用着老夫的牙齒和指甲，老夫的犠牲未免太大了。呵呵！借你的利爪，消滅你的蟹肉；待到蟹消滅凈盡，你這利爪也没用了：只好和那殘餘的蟹殼，一齊埋葬在垃圾桶裏！　　我在旁座聽了，便引起了我的感想：　　東三省不是大螃蟹麽？盈斗的蟹黃，已供給那侵略者的大嚼；但是，依舊饕　無厭，一方面嗾動僞國軍，一方面收買義勇軍，要借着他們做蟹爪，以便消滅我愛國健兒，而不犠牲着矮子的實力。唉！解爪聽者！你們殘害同胞的結果，也不過同葬在垃圾桶裏！何苦呢？何苦呢？幸福的人  窒暗　　丨含笑而看火燒丨　　在半醒半睡中聽得一位先生嚷［看火燒呀！］因而記起一二八後在我們六樓上含笑而看閘北火燒的那羣不速之客。　　一二八後的閘北大火燒如大家知道是由於日敵的丢炸彈。望着撩天的烽火，假如是稍有良知的人，總該掩面而切齒吧，但是在我們的六樓上，每天的日暮時候總來了不少不速之客，他們或伊們携兒帶女，大呼小呌，據高遠望，在薄暮的餘暉中，映着笑嘻嘻的歡容；有的還說［火燒好看，難爲人家。］這兩句俗諺，是我們國人的墓誌銘。但在當初，我想這兩句話還能表示出一絲的同情心，到現在，則如君子們所說似的［人心不古］了，［難爲人家］雖還和［火燒好看］聯在一起，而實際，則［好看］才是心的供狀，而［難爲］云者，不過以兩句原聯在一起，不得不說在一起罷了　　對於敵人的炸彈燬壞着我們同胞的屋宇及生命，就是澈底的卑怯罷，含笑而觀之的餘暇縐不該有的了；然而托着租界之福竟能含笑而看之，這種人，無以名之，名之曰幸福之人罷。　　據說有人問過在上海當巡捕的印度人，說：你作了亡國奴，幸福麽？印度人的回答是一點頭之外，再附以一個莞爾微笑。今日的中國幸福之人，大槪是和印度的幸福之人同樣幸福罷？　　然而，印度是在領袖領導之下努力奮鬥，思離英而獨立，而中國，則在領袖領導之下長期抵抗而趨淪亡：兩者，一個如日之升，一個如日之落。石膏模型接骨  乙未生　　丨發見臭蟲殖民地丨　　近世醫學進步，外科手術亦日新而月異，除向有之解剖術外，近來　　對於傷科接骨，往往施用石膏模型。其法就是按照受傷部分的本來形狀，澆製石膏模型一具，令病人將受傷部分放置模型裏頭，歷時若干，讓骨段生合，往往有好幾個月動彈不得的，據說常有奇效。有一位友人的友人，跌折了脛骨，去就醫。醫生用石膏模型方法替他醫治。他把一條小腿放置入石膏模型内之後，第二日便覺得奇癢難當。他想不到石膏模型醫治會有這樣難受的滋味，但是醫生吩咐不能移動，便也無可奈何。這樣的奇癢，以次加甚，他只好勉强挨住；因爲想把折斷了的脛骨接好，便只得耐點苦。經過了若干時候之後丨大約兩個多月丨接合的期間已滿，便遵照醫生的命令，把石膏模型打開。原來裏面已經孶生了一個小小的臭蟲民族。大大小小有好幾十四。這大約是一兩匹臭蟲從石膏模型的源縫爬進裏面，發見了那裏面好吃好住，宜於殖民，便在那裏安生樂業起來。這位朋友的小腿雖然咬了不少塊，耗了好幾滴血，但是脛骨終算接好了。女人意職  定　　丨破浪一般　没有準則丨　　女人們來懇求你的時候，是用了伊整個的媚態來誘惑你，使你的心旌動搖，神魂酣醉，你不得不充分地供給伊的需求。但是等伊得到滿足之後，伊的態度就不媚了，除非伊發動第二次懇求你的時候。　　成衣匠送來一襲新裝，伊嫌乳部平而不顯，醫部直而不凸······伊用呵斥的口氣向他說：［你看！還成一件衣裳嗎？］他很會意地帶了轉去。再送來時，伊又覺得太顯露了；比以前還緊一步的向他說：你簡直飯都倒裝了丨］他恰似笑非笑的站着！　　伊極希望和伊的男友在影院的黑幕裏，公園的樹蔭裏，熱烈的試一次初吻。可是伊的男友在這樣的機會裏向伊請求時，伊却好似這一吻又是極神聖而不能隨時的了。　　女人們的意職，有如伊們衣飾的善變！東方女性的典型  達文　　丨電影悲角陳玉梅丨　　東方女性的典型，决不是富有誘惑性的［肉］的［熱］的女演員，因爲　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　什麽［甜姐兒］［熱女郎，］充其量，不過能夠表演些美國化的麻醉性的電影，絕對不會沾染一些東方以彩的。　　東方女性的典型，要有苗條的身材，秀麗的容貌，溫柔的性情，幽嫻的舉止。我以爲具備上面的條件的，很適宜於表演悲劇，不錯，善演悲劇的陳玉梅，確是東方女性的典型！　　有好多觀衆，比伊爲麗琳甘許，的確，伊在默片時代的作風，委實和麗琳甘許相像，如［空門紅淚，］［夫妻之間］等片，伊所表演的都是封建社會中的犠牲者；這正和麗琳甘許的［賴婚］［二孤女］等片所表演的被家長王······等權力所壓迫而不能抵抗的悲角相同，就是伊那種沉默怯弱的神態，也有很多地多和麗琳甘許相像。　　伊自從主演有聲影片［芸蘭姑娘］以後，伊的作風便有了顯著的變換，伊所表演的，雖然仍舊是封建社會中的被壓迫者，但伊到了忍無可忍的時候，便不怕犠牲一切，起而反抗，而伊的神態，也不似從前那麽沉默怯弱，這倒很像珍妮蓋諾，因爲珍妮蓋諾所表演的，是一個剛從封建思想解放出來的自由主義者　　伊最近主演的［蘭谷萍踪］，作風是和［芸蘭姑娘］相同，但是反抗性和剌激性，較［芸蘭姑娘］更爲强烈。伊爲戀愛而奮鬬，爲生活而奮鬬，伊做了現代中國半解放社會中的女性代表者。所以我說：弱不禁風，工愁善病的［紅樓夢］派人物，是過去的東方女性的典型；肥臀大腿，浪漫摩登的［美國派］人物，也許是未來東方女性的典型？像［蘭谷萍踪］中的陳玉梅，却是現代東方女性的典型　　短訊　梅蘭芳之長子葆琦，今年九歲，秉性穎悟，尤能勤學，洵爲玉雪可兒，其態度度酷肖乃父，茲以遽櫻喉疾，於本月十七夜殤於北平，噩電昨已到滬。梅最愛此子，其痛悼必逾尋常，北平各界慰唁者當必絡繹門庭矣。入關郵侶　（十七）  求幸福主　　他堂兄聽了，再没有可說的，只好捆上舖蓋，帶了家眷，走他自己的陽關大道，把魯伯勤就孤零零的一個人扔在這危險萬狀的瀋陽市上了，他雖失了個可以桱息的家庭，但還有個資爲生活的職業，不至於完全漂泊無依。等他堂兄走後，他從那英文夜館的屋子裏搬出行囊來，寄居於一位相熟的同事家中，因爲地點也在這浩然里左近，與佟一貞朝夕約會，見面還很便利，才特爲揀選了這一處好地方。　　旣有這一度搬遷，當然要在露天常會的議席上，對佟一貞有個詳盡的報告，雖所宣示的仍是那一套冠冤堂皇的話，證明他幸不卑怯，以針鋒萬泉公園伊那一次反唇的相譏。然而佟一貞不是没有會心的，自也了解他那不與堂兄同走的最大原因，實是兼顧著要與伊同這場患難，以盡他始終保護的負任。嘴皮上雖大家都不必點穿，而在佟一貞的心中，自很嘉許個兒郎的饒有肝膽，幷深深感念他的情義眞摰。　　至於佟家呢？本是這地方的窮土着，没有遠徙到關内避難的理由與能力，當然還聽天由命的困守在藩陽。只是佟一貞那最能幹的嬸嬸，没有什麽大宅門子可串了，女姣際家淪到英雄無可用武的地步，一家人的生計就益發感着拮据。爲了這個，偶爾也對一貞理怨着道：［都是你！倘若你早能答應李家的婚事，如今我們都跟李司令到天津租界上過舒服日子去，免得困在這兒受竊受嚇，那是何等不好？］但事後的埋怨究是無用，幾次設法打聽得李司令和高副官的平津住址，寫了幾封信去訴苦，也老接不着回信，便只好死了這條心。　　倒是魯伯勤那幹小差事没什大出息的小夥子，爲了佟家生活困難，再不供給一貞的零用，幷時時找伊發窮氣；他看不過去，就把每月從郵局領來的微薄的薪水，極力撙節，隨時奉獻給一貞。除一貞自用以外，幷還能多少帶些回家，聊補伊叔嬸過苦日子之用，不至於一籌不展分文不進。佟家叔嬸便因［飢者易爲食］的緣故，反不得不感念魯伯勤這點小恩惠，改過口來又稱讚伯勤是個好人，仍容許一貞與他交朋友。　　魯伯勤不幸之中另有幸運，藉此竟還能公然出入佟家的門户，受佟家叔嬸破例的優待。於是這一雙愛侶，再要圖個團聚。不必再冒風霜雨雪開露天會議，儘能在佟家圍爐作娓娓情話；患難中所過的日子，反而更甜蜜了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言（吹牛）名詞的消長　  佛　　吹牛與拍馬原是連當碼　，都是心理上一種愈量緊張與弛緩的狀態、二者確有連帶的性質、今日且不談拍馬，祇講吹牛，　　吹牛名詞之由來、莫可考矣，不過從第三字連續讀之，則吹牛的名詞，一定由低級社會製造出來的名詞，决非由長衫同志製造出來的名詞、决無疑義，惟其名詞普及於各界，而應用咸宜者，即可推想其效力之偉大矣，　　吹牛二字，若照從前的字義來解釋，近乎矜誇，若照現在的字義來解釋，近乎宣傳，因吹牛與宣傳，其義固不甚相遠也，宣傳原是絕好的方法，因爲你有這樣東西，或那樣寳貝，無人得知，若一經宣傳，則人人共曉，這是宣傳的一種妙用，譬如現在美國總選競爭，雙方到處演說，均以政策主義相號召，這也是一種宣傳的方法，　　吹牛的意義，原不如宣傳的高尙和實際，不問内容如何，事實如何，儘管拼命宣傳，這個宣傳，就呌做吹牛，故吹牛和宣傳，其分别即在於此，換一句話，宣傳必須有其事實方可，若吹牛則不必定有其事實，也可信口開河，　　馬路上出賣的洋泡泡，起初祇一些橡皮，若一經氣吹，便變得非常龐大，不過吹得過於厲害，就要[撲秃]穿破，這眞是吹牛的一個絕好比喻，倘眞正是宣傳，不會有這樣的毛病，現在的確是一個吹牛世界，故無論何人，無論何事，非吹牛不可，非儘量吹牛不可，好在現在的人，都是以耳爲目，只要你吹得厲害，自會有人相信，　　吹牛二字，原是世界上不可少的工具，但是現在只聽見宣傳的名詞，而吹牛的名詞，不大容易聽見，大約吹牛的名詞與宣傳的名詞消長之機乎，文藝過烟台偶泊有感  鄧守鈞　　舟人話說到烟台，海上商塲第二推，怨煞中原無内治，空敎辜負已收回，　　空敎辜負已收回，血染神州事正哀，爭得將軍心似鐡，誰憐民命付殘灰，　　誰憐民命付殘灰，東北未收魯難來，海上波濤山上角，聲聲都是釀愁媒，　　聲聲都是釀愁媒，大難何人刦挽回，將軍莫自稱英武，與汝偕亡日已來，科學味精的製法  顧履霜　　味精在以前只有日貸，後來經國内化學家的努力，始有國產品問世，把日貸的市場都奪了回來，在抵貸史上也不可謂非光榮的一件事。　　國產品很多，名詞不一，最主要者有味精，味母，觀音粉，和合粉，味素等出品，價廉物美，所以國人均樂用，已成極普遍的調味品。但許多人只知用，不知這妙東西，却來自極普通的麵粉。故今特將其製法，約略說說，雖不能說就好去自造，至少可以得到一點常識。　　味精的主要成份爲麸酸的鈉鹽（SodiumGlutamate),國產品均由麵粉提煉；日本產者，則由海邊一種小魚製出，彼等廣告爲素品，可見日人欺騙之一斑。　　上述味精之原料麵粉，加水　之成厚粥狀，用水冲之得粘厚膠狀物，即普通所食的麵筋，冲下之粉名小粉。此等手續，想讀者已熟見。無錫同志，恐更明瞭。　　麵筋製出後，用微溫烘乾，放入土堤中，加等重量之鹽酸，如麵筋一兩則加鹽酸一兩，埕口蓋緊，放置數日。　　數日後，埕口揷入一十餘尺之玻管，埕口仍須封緊，僅留玻管之出口。以此埕放入油池中，隔油燃之，油池溫度約攝氏一百二十五度，以麵筋之水解（Hydrolysis)。燃熱適當時間後·埕内盡變爲黃黑色之物。將此倒出濾之，濾下之液加微溫蒸發及半。候冷，即有白色結晶析出，即麩酸。將結晶濾出，用淡鹽酸溶液冲洗，濾下液稱母液，可製醬油精。　　麩酸的結晶洗潔後，重加水溶化，再加入苛性鈉溶液，則由中和作用而成味精及食鹽，以此混合液加溫蒸發，食鹽結晶先析出，濾去之。濾下液加入酒精，因味精不溶於酒精而生沉澱，放入離心機，將酒精倒出，沉澱之味精加燃烘乾，裝瓶出售。　　由麵粉所製味精，可得麵筋量之百份之二十七左右，其他原料可用黃荳、大荳等，但出產比較少些。　　小粉亦爲重要之副產品。冲下的小粉，用水洗淨後，烘乾，可售於紗廠作漬紗用，或用以製糖。　　以上所述，但求明簡，故未將全部做法詳述，因地位有限，又本文主旨在告讀者以普通知識，只得略略的說了個大概。（改良社會討論會）統一學校敎科書我見  慈民　　　　　　中華民國的敎育宗旨是：　　[中華民國之敎育，根據三民主義，以充實人民生活，扶助社會生存，發展國民生計，延續民族生命爲目的。務期民族獨立，民權普遍，民生發展，以促進世界大同，]　　　這堂堂皇皇的敎育宗旨，是中華民國全國一致的。在敎育的性質上，　論是學校敎育，社會敎育：在敎育的類别上，不論是職業敎育，師範敎育：在敎育的學制系統上，不論是小學，中學，大學；總之，都應該以此宗旨爲目標，爲鵠的，爲最後歸宿，這是無可疑義的。　　我們要達到某種目標，必須採用某種手段：要達到某種相同的目標，必須採用某種相同的手段。換句話說，我國各學校，各敎育機關，要達到相同的敎育宗旨，必先須採用内容一貫，上下啣接的相同的敎育手段，這又是　無可疑義的。　　［敎育手段］丨工具丨是什麽？是敎育書。［採用相同的敎育手段］是什麽？就是採用相同的敎科書。　　然而，我們試檢閱目前我國各學校採用敎科書的情形是怎樣？爲簡便起見，我們單就小學校而論：　　第一，編輯小學敎科書的人，眞是許多許多，各自爲謀，毫無聯絡。第二，出版敎科畫的書坊，有商務，中華，世界，兒童，開明，民智······等。第三，小學敎科書的名目，又有新學制，新時代，新主義，新課程，其本：丨等。第四，各小學校採用的敎科書，有的是新學　　新時代，有的是新主義，基本·新課程。同一學校，高級可以採用基本·中級却採用新主義，低級又採用新時代；同一學級，國語可以採用基本，常職可以採用新課程，算術又可以採用新學制。這種奇奇怪怪的現象，大槪也會適用於中學，大學的吧！所以，各級學校採用敎科書的良莠不齊，顯然是呈現於我國目前敎育界中的事實，這更是無可疑義的。　　對於這個用書問題，似乎很少有人注意，敎育部抱着[拿在籃裏就是菜]的態度，隨隨便便審定各書局出版的敎科書，各省，市，縣，敎育當局，也從不曾對於這個問題，加以稍稍注意。每當學期或學年更始的時光，我們總是看得見各書局在報上大吹大擂的登着巨幅引人注意的廣告，說什麽[敎育部審定，]［最合兒童心理］［便於敎學］······一類，　話，但如果按諸實際，我們就會發覺各種名目不同的敎科書，形式上旣有深淺難易的不同，内容上也未必盡能一致。於是，問題的結　，就潛伏在這裹。我們如何能期望採用各别的敎科書的學校，接受各别的敎學内容的學生，踏着整齊的步伐，向同一的目標前進呢？　　愚意，敎科書的統一問題，粗看似極渺小，但關係敎育前途，實非淺鮮。茲姑擬辦法數行，與本會會員，共同討論：　　一，敎育部應敦聘全國敎育專家，聚於一堂，以中華民國敎育宗旨爲目標，集思廣益，編輯各種内容充實，上下聯繫的標準敎科書，供各級學校採用。　　二，現有各書坊，只准販賣敎科書以外的在考書，那已經出版的敎科書，均禁止發售。　　三，標準敎科書由敎育部委託書局代印，或自辦印刷所發行，務期能依最低生產價格出賣，以减輕學生負擔，　　四，每種敎科書的紙張，式樣，鉛字，行列，裝訂等，須一律。　　五，限令全國各學校，一致採用。如有因地制宜的敎材，儘可充當各校補充讀物之用。　　這個辦法，當局苟能實行，我想不但可使全國靑年學子，踏着同一的步調，依着同一的路線，向[中華民國敎育宗旨]的堂皇鵠的，邁步前進；而且小學，中學，大學之間的鴻溝，也可全部泯滅。　　這原是愚者千慮，是否有當，尙祈高明指正丨隨便談談拉雜寫來  　　援助東北義勇軍籌欵處，會像電影院裏售票處那樣的擁擠和熱閙，那麽，東三省失地，老早就可收復了。　　···········　　意志堅强和富有毅力的人，他足夠應付一切困難的環境而不爲牠所征服，幷且有時還能去改造牠。意志薄弱和見難畏縮的人，只有永遠爲環境所支配。　　···········　　交友須擇好人，所以古傅有[近朱者赤，近墨者黑]的兩句格言，但是世界上的許多歹人，若要感化他們來海過，那麽，就正需要好人能同他去交友。　　···········　　金錢萬能，惟其因爲牠是萬能，所以也可稱爲萬惡，然而不論牠能爲善爲惡，於金錢的本身是無關係的，因爲牠的主使者，究竟還是人類。　　···········　　物質文明的進步，造福人類的地方雖然很多，但是爲害人類的地方却也不少。　　···········　　生活的壓迫，足以使人發憤，也足以使人墮落。　　···········　　慾望的進步無限止。　　···········　　在馬路上所觸目的是[現代最新式時裝]，[摩登歐化用具]，[頂頂時髦的裝飾品]的招牌，啊！一個生產落後的中國，而她的銷費却樣樣要模仿最新式最進步的歐美了，經濟破產的危機是怎樣的可怕吓。　　···········　　一隻狗和一隻貓雖是畜類，牠們尙能各司其事，各盡其職，世有專事坐吃而不作生產的人，眞是不如畜類。　　···········　　一個民族，一定要生長在困苦環境的掙扎中，使他鍜練得各有强健的體格，耐勞的精神，奮鬥的志氣，如此方有生存的價値。例如東北的民衆，他們平時都是十分勞苦而方得享受，所以他們有特殊的民族性，現在土地雖被敵人强佔，而數十萬的人民都變了義勇軍來羣起抗日，再接再厲，百折不回，這就是偉大的民族性的表現。反之在奢侈環境中的民族，他們並不要勞動而就得享受，加之物質上的供給太舒適了，結果，足以堕落了民族的志氣而成爲一個[没出息的民族]。</p>

<h3>Han Fuqu Still Hesitant About Withdrawal</h3>
<h3>Liu's Army Still Returns to Defence of Laiyang</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu said this morning that the purpose of sending troops to Liu was to relieve the suffering of the people. Now that Liu is not gone, the suffering of the people is not resolved. If the withdrawal of troops causes Liu to further poison the local area, he would not be able to face the people. Therefore, he still needs to consider the withdrawal of troops. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han continued to say that, because he was considering the withdrawal of troops, the telegrams reporting the withdrawal of troops to various places had not been sent. Because Yu Shuang is honest and frank, he dare not deceive his superiors. This morning, he sent Division Commander Gu Liangmin and Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue to the front line of eastern Shandong for inspection. Yu will not go there temporarily. Liu only occupies Laiyang and Yexian, which is not very important. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shahe Telegram. After Li Yue and others left on the 13th, on the 14th, Liu's army in Yecheng opened fire on the position of the provincial army Ma Guanyi's brigade south of the city, totaling more than a hundred soldiers. The last few days have been extremely peaceful. Brigade Commander Rong Guangxing arrived in Shahe from Laiyang on the 18th to visit Cao to discuss the withdrawal of Liu's army in Laiyang when Fan Yuhuang arrived. The next day, they still advanced to the original defense. There is an extreme shortage of food in Yecheng. Soldiers are paid on a proportional basis every day, but the people do not see a single grain of rice. Many people starved to death, and many who could not bear the hunger committed suicide.

<h3>Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses Opinions on the Report</h3>
<h3>Generally Trending Towards Four Points</h3>
<h3>Still Awaiting Final Decision</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the opinions of various important figures on the report, in addition to the abbreviated versions of Wang and Jiang, it is reported that Hu Hanmin also telegraphed for his opinions in a private capacity by a certain gentleman. Hu has already released his opinions in Hong Kong, which will be regarded here as the individual views of someone in the opposition. The opinions of Wang and Jiang are largely the same. The Foreign Affairs Committee has been discussing measures for days, which are not much different from the proposals of Wang and Jiang. However, the proposals have not been fully decided. It is reported that the Yan, Gu, and Guo representatives have been reporting by telegram on the tone of the British, French, Italian, and German representatives in Geneva, and the opinions of important figures in the United States and Switzerland, which are of considerable research value. Experts have been discussing for days and generally tend to the following four points: 1. The proposal of the Investigation Team to resolve the Northeast problem can be accepted in principle. However, it is necessary to clearly stipulate that the history of the Northeast and the wishes of the people of the whole country are that the three provinces are permanently Chinese territory, in line with the agreement of the China Association on territorial integrity. Anything beyond this limit is unacceptable. 2. The recommendations of the Investigation Team only have an outline and no implementation plan. It is hoped that the meeting will stipulate that the case be resolved by arbitration. It is best to avoid direct negotiations between China and Japan. Otherwise, negotiations between China and Japan under the decision of the League of Nations are not impossible. 3. The report of the Investigation Team still has unclear content about the content of the Party. The motives for boycotting Japanese goods should also be stated in the proposal to dispel global misunderstandings. 4. Knowing that Japan will have a proposal to argue against it, our side should also try its best to express the disadvantages of the Investigation Team's recommendations to us, or the points that cannot meet the expectations of our people, as well as the points signed by the two members of the Wang and Jiang committees. The three proposals should be made into three proposals, and a telegram should be sent to the three representatives to submit to the General Assembly. It is now reported that the Minister of Foreign Affairs must conduct the final consultation with Wang in Shanghai, and the various ministers must also participate in the meeting before deciding on the wording, and then hand it over to the staff designated by the Foreign Affairs Committee to draft it. After the draft is completed, it will be submitted to the Central Political Committee and then released. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government's countermeasures against the report. Since Song and Luo consulted Wang and Jiang's opinions, the Foreign Affairs Committee has been seriously reviewing it for days.

<p>(Beiping) A Reuters correspondent met with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi today, who stated that the relations between China and Japan are gradually improving, and the two countries will not turn against each other in the future, because the interests of both countries are related to peace. The same goes for [Manchukuo]. The government is currently busy with many affairs and has no time to spare. When the correspondent asked about the Rehe matter, he said that the problem is difficult and complex, and its future will be resolved within a considerable period of time. As for the [Manchukuo] government's plan to merge the province into its territory, if the Chinese authorities do not take any provocative actions, it seems unlikely that this will happen at present. The correspondent also asked about the widespread rumors among the Japanese that North China will be restored to the throne. If this happens, what attitude will Japan take? The Japanese ambassador said that this is nonsense, so there is no need to pay attention to it. He also said that Japan is very willing to get along well with China, because Japan has huge industries in northern and southern China.

<p>Receive Important News　　Attacking the Twenty-Fourth Army, thus expanding the scope. Now, Shunqing has been occupied by the four divisions of Li, Tian, Yang, and is attacking Jinan and Suining. The Twenty-Fourth Army is preparing to abandon it, while in the area between Jiangjin and Yongchuan, Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui are still on mutual alert, and a war is likely to break out sooner or later. (To be continued) The Jinan Local Court Tries the Zheng Jicheng Case　　(Continued)　　At this point, the judge asked the defendant's lawyer for his opinion. Zheng's lawyer, Zhou Qingen, stood up to defend, arguing that the prosecutor's indictment accused Chen Fengshan and Zheng Jicheng of committing two counts of murder with a single act. First, it should be investigated whether it was premeditated. According to Article 284 of the Criminal Law, literally speaking, "pre" means preparation, and "meditation" means planning. According to the literal meaning, premeditation requires long-term planning. Zheng's confessions before and after were consistent, stating that he heard people on the road saying that Zhang Zongchang was leaving when he returned home from the charity. Because he drank at home, he thought of avenging his father, and went to the station. The time from the initial intention to the murder was also very short, not even half an hour. The intention of the criminal act was only a moment, which proves that it was not premeditated. The original indictment said that holding a grudge and thinking of avenging his father is a matter of morality and cannot be considered premeditated murder. Holding a grudge can be active or passive and cannot be said to be premeditated. Therefore, from the perspective of time, it cannot be said to be premeditated. According to the confession, Chen Fengshan did not initially know that he was killing Zhang Zongchang. When they arrived at the station, Zheng instructed him not to shoot randomly, which shows that there was no joint premeditation. Zheng even forbade him to raise his gun and surrender, which is open and aboveboard and shows that it was not a secret premeditation. Furthermore, from the perspective of facts, whether the two Lius are responsible should be investigated first to see if the defendant could have foreseen killing others. According to repeated confessions, he only saw Zhang Zongchang and did not see anyone else, which shows that he had no criminal awareness or foresight. Regarding Chen Fengshan, whether the two Lius were injured or killed by Chen should also be investigated. Since it was not a box of bullets, it proves that it was not fired by Zheng or Chen. (According to patrol officer Bi Shizhen, Chen was carrying a box gun.) At the time, the law enforcement team proved that Zhang Zongchang's entourage heard the alarm and rushed to protect him with guns, which shows that, based on the bullets, it was neither Zheng nor Chen. Even if it was Chen, Zheng was unaware and cannot be held responsible. This proves that Zheng forbade Chen from killing people. Even if Chen violated Zheng's intentions and killed someone, Zheng cannot be held responsible and can only be held responsible for killing Zhang Zongchang. Furthermore, Zhang Zongchang harmed the country and the people, and killing him is justifiable. In addition to the one-third reduction in sentence for surrendering, Article 77 of the Criminal Law should also be applied, with a sentence ranging from three years and four months to twelve years. Next, lawyer Sun Baifu argued, stating briefly that the point of contention in this case is whether it was premeditated. Zhang Zongchang was powerful at the time. (Later, he still acted tyrannically. At the time, no one dared to think of killing Zhang. Even passersby hated him, and Zheng had an old grudge, so he hated him even more.) Therefore, when he arrived at the station, he feared that Zhang's entourage would be numerous and had not yet decided to kill him. When he saw that Zhang had few people, he killed him. The indictment stating that it was premeditated is incorrect and is still ordinary murder. As for the killing of the two Lius, not only does Zheng not admit to hearing Chen kill them, but the bullets also do not match, and there is no proof. Zheng cannot be held responsible. Even if it was Chen who killed them, Chen was responsible for protecting Zheng. Zheng killed Zhang, and Chen feared that Zhang's entourage would kill Zheng, so he killed Zhang's entourage. Even if it were a fact, Chen's actions were justified self-defense and not a crime under criminal law. Zheng cannot be held jointly responsible. According to the above evidence, Zheng Jicheng committed the crime of ordinary murder. According to the law, the sentence can be reduced by one-third for surrendering. Furthermore, he avenged his father at great risk and can also have his sentence reduced by one-half according to Article 77 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 66 of the same law, he can be sentenced to the lowest degree of punishment within the scope of the crime. Furthermore, our country is founded on morality and values filial piety and righteousness. In the past, avenging one's father was not considered a crime. Liu Zongyuan's rebuttal of the discussion on revenge is most popular and shows a glimpse of public opinion. If Zheng's crime is too severe, it would be inconsistent with human sentiment. Furthermore, Zhang Zongchang was a leader of the counter-revolution and should be killed. Killing someone who deserves to die according to the Qing law is not a crime. Although it cannot be applied now, the sentence should still be lighter. Lawyer Li Yunsheng also spoke, stating briefly that lawyers Zhou and Sun had already elaborated on the case in detail. He would now briefly state the salient points. This case is being prosecuted under Article 284 of the Criminal Law for premeditated murder, but there is no evidence of any accomplices. Chen Fengshan was merely Zheng's bodyguard, and Zheng had a deep hatred for Zhang Zongchang for killing his father. In the past, Zhang Zongchang was too powerful, and Zheng did not dare to think of revenge. Now that Zhang is out of power, Zheng heard people talking when he went home and thought of revenge after drinking. Shooting at the station shows that it was not premeditated. According to Article 42 of the Criminal Law, two or more people jointly committing a crime, but in this case, it was definitely not the actions of two people because Chen Fengshan did not fire a gun and did not hit Zhang Zongchang. Furthermore, the bullets do not match, and the station was in chaos at the time. Dozens of shots were fired randomly, and there is no way to prove it. According to Liu Huaizhou's obituary, he was chasing people with a gun when Chen killed him, which shows that killing Liu was also self-defense and not joint premeditated murder. Zheng should be convicted according to Article 86 of the Criminal Law for acting out of righteous indignation and has nothing to do with the deaths of the two Lius. Furthermore, he surrendered immediately, which is open and aboveboard. According to the Criminal Law, surrendering can reduce the sentence. The honorable prosecutor has already stated that the sentence can be reduced by one-half based on mitigating circumstances. The judge then asked Zheng Jicheng if he had any other comments. Zheng replied that Chen Fengshan used a steel gun, which was very powerful and could penetrate people's bodies and not fall on them. Furthermore, the bullets were not from my gun. The judge asked where his gun was now. Zheng replied that he did not know because he had dropped the gun at the time and was also beaten. Lawyer Zhou Qingen spoke again, requesting the court to stop the detention according to Articles 74 and 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law. At this point, the judge announced that the debate in the case had concluded and a date would be set for the verdict. Zheng Jicheng was taken back into custody, and the request to stop the detention would be decided separately. He then signed his name to the record to confirm that it was accurate and adjourned the court. It was already 12:30. (15th) Continued Report on Communist Bandit Disturbances in Rizhao　　Qingdao Correspondence: Details of the communist bandit disturbances in Rizhao were provided in yesterday's report. According to a person from the county, after the county party department arrested communist Li Pingzhang in the summer of last year and executed him in Jinan, communist elements in the county remained hidden in the countryside, vigorously inciting the proletariat. Many farmers with limited knowledge were tempted to join. However, at the time, they were not strong enough and did not dare to launch an immediate riot. After more than a year of preparation, more people joined, and their strength gradually increased. Since the autumn of this year, the party has often made strong demands on local property owners. If someone rents out land and asks tenants for rent, the tenants often refuse to pay, and the landlords do not dare to pursue the matter. On the 1st of this month, when the county government police team killed Shi Yicheng and arrested Zheng Quanqin, there were rumors of communists rising up in rebellion, but there was no evidence of it. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 AM on the 14th, when the villages were still asleep, the communist bandits secretly plotted a rebellion. Over 50 places rioted simultaneously, indicating that it was a planned action. In villages without walls, all self-defense firearms were seized, and telegraph and telephone lines were cut off. At the time, the groups north of the city gathered in Anjia Village and Yujia Village, while the groups south of the city gathered in Pingjia Village and Miaojia Village. Now, in order to concentrate their forces, the bandits have gathered at Chaoyang Temple (a mountain) on the southwestern border of the county and are using it as their base. It is said that the leaders are Zheng Guohong and Yu Gongfang, who are both important figures in the communist party. They launched the rebellion suddenly, taking advantage of the incident in Jiaodong, which implies a major conspiracy. The Rizhao county seat was originally garrisoned by a battalion of provincial troops, but due to the small number of troops, they only defended the city walls and did not go into the countryside to suppress the bandits. The bandits, in turn, were untrained and did not dare to attack the county seat, so there were no conflicts with the provincial troops. It is said that the bandits have gathered over 5,000 people, and the number of firearms seized from the people is no less than 1,000. If the authorities do not quickly suppress them, the problem may spread and become a major local disaster. (October 16) Ge Guangting Goes to Beiping to Meet Zhang　　Talks About the Navy Taking Over Defense of Yantai Before Departure　　Jinan Correspondence: Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, came to Jinan from Qingdao yesterday. He originally planned to go to Beiping that night to meet Zhang Xueliang to report on the situation. However, he stayed for another day to wait for Jiang Bocheng to travel together. Later, Jiang stayed in Jinan temporarily due to the Lu Dong incident. Ge then took the train to Beiping at 6:40 PM tonight. Before leaving, Ge told reporters that when Liu's army first withdrew from Yantai, the city's defenses were weak. At that time, Japanese naval captain Tsuda, under the pretext of protecting Japanese residents, wanted to send troops to land. The move was opposed by the American warship, and he did not dare to act alone. At the time, someone telegraphed Navy Commander and Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie to report the situation. Commander Shen believed that Yantai's relations with foreign countries and local security were extremely important. In addition to sending troops to land in Yantai to maintain order, he also negotiated with the Japanese, promising to take full responsibility for protecting the lives and property of foreigners in Yantai and asked them not to send troops to land to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, Yantai was able to remain safe. However, the Yantai regime belongs to the Shandong Provincial Government. Now that the Provincial Government has sent people to Yantai, the Navy will naturally hand over defense duties. The Japanese also had no objections, so there were no complications. The Navy landed in Yantai to maintain order because Yantai's relations with foreign countries and local security were very important at the time. The provincial troops had not yet arrived, and the local security was also very important, so this action was taken and was not intended to protect any party. (October 17) Hunan Province Measures to Ban Opium Trafficking　　Banning Planting, Selling, and Smoking in Stages　　Designating Opium Transit Routes in Hunan　　Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan Provincial Government formally established the Hunan Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee on the 24th of last month. He Jian appointed himself as the chairman and hired party, government, and military leaders as committee members, deciding to abandon the previous method of legalizing opium through fines and absolutely prohibit opium without levying fines. In the past two weeks, various plans have been formulated, and the heads of various departments have been instructed to implement them. The determined implementation plans include the following: (1) Banning planting: divided into three phases, starting from October 10th of this year. The first phase is set for two months, tasking the county magistrates with making pledges to prohibit planting in each district, township, and village, and advising people to grow other crops. The second phase is set for three months, tasking the county magistrates with inspecting the districts and removing any opium seedlings found. Opium planters will be punished with detention or imprisonment, and fines will not be allowed in lieu of detention or imprisonment. The third phase is set for two months, dividing the province into 15 districts, with one provincial inspector assigned to each district to inspect. If any opium planting is detected, the land will be confiscated regardless of ownership, and opium planters will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. (2) Banning sales: starting from November 1st, with a three-month limit, tasking the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs with investigating the number of opium dens, opium traders, and opium vendors in the area, creating a list, and ordering them to stop operating. The existing opium and opium paraphernalia will be confiscated and destroyed, and pledges will be obtained from each district, township, and village to prohibit sales. After three months, if any opium sales are detected in the area, the building will be confiscated regardless of ownership, the opium will be burned, and the opium sellers will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. (3) Banning smoking: divided into three phases, starting from November 1st. The first phase is set for three months, as a period of persuasion, tasking the county magistrates with accurately determining the number of opium addicts in their jurisdiction, clearly identifying their names, addresses, occupations, ages, livelihoods, and any illnesses, classifying them by rank, compiling a list, and obtaining pledges from each opium addict to quit. The district, township, and village heads will be responsible for persuading each opium addict to quit. The second phase is a forced detoxification period. The county magistrates will investigate and find opium addicts in their jurisdiction who have not quit and order the district, township, and village heads to order them to undergo forced detoxification within a time limit according to the following categories: Category A: two months, for young adults with family wealth. Category B: three months, for poor laborers. Category C: five months, for those over 50 years of age without illness or under 50 with illness. Category D: eight months, for those over 50 years of age with illness. In the third phase, those who relapse and smoke opium after the forced detoxification period will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Since the measures for banning planting, selling, and smoking have been announced, the ban on transportation is also the most concerning and difficult to implement for the general public. Hunan Province does not produce much opium, but most of the opium produced in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan is transported through Hunan for sale. The Ministry of Finance has set up the Hunan Special Tax Clearing Office in Hunan to collect special taxes, which can generate an average monthly income of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Initially, half of the income was remitted to the central government and half was used for the Fourth Route Army. Later, because the Fourth Route Army expanded to six divisions, and the military expenditure was huge, He Jian submitted a request to the central government, which was approved, to allocate all the income to the Fourth Route Army. If the ban on transportation is implemented, this large source of income will be lost, and the military expenditure will inevitably be difficult. If the ban on transportation is not implemented, then the so-called ban on planting, selling, and smoking would be unnecessary. Therefore, He Jian and the committee members carefully considered the matter, aiming not to harm tax revenue and to implement the opium prohibition goal. Finally, it was decided to adopt the "beggar-thy-neighbor" method. Opium from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan is still allowed to be transported out of the province through designated routes in Hunan, but it is absolutely not allowed to stay or be sold in Hunan. The twelve articles of the regulations were announced and implemented on the 16th of this month. The regulations are as follows: (1) These regulations are formulated in accordance with Article 5 of the Opium Prohibition Implementation Regulations. (2) Before the central government determines the opium transportation ban, all special goods passing through Hunan may be supervised and transported out of the province in accordance with the following routes: (A) Goods from Yunnan and Guizhou: directly from Guiyang to Hongjiang, via Wugang into Shaoyang, and then via Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Hengshan, Hengyang, Leiyang, Yangxing, Zixing, Chenxian, Yizhang, Rucheng, and Guidong, out to Guangdong and Jiangxi; or via Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Changsha, Xiangyin, Yueyang, and Linxiang, out to Wuhan, or via Changsha and Liling to Jiangxi. (B) Goods from Guizhou: via Fenghuang, Mayang, Chenxi, Yuanling, and Taoyuan into Changde, and then out to Wuhan, or via Changsha out of the province. (C) Goods from Sichuan: via Sangzhi and Shimen into Jinshi, and then via Anxiang, Yuanjiang, Yiyang, and Changsha out of the province, or via Anxiang, Nanxian, and Huarong out to Public Security and Shishou in Hubei. (3) The Hunan Special Tax Clearing Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Supervision Office of the Fourth Route Army may establish a general office in Changsha and branch offices in Hongjiang, Taoyang, Changde, Jinshi, and Rucheng, specializing in the import, export, supervision, transportation, and taxation of goods from Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. All branch offices, commissioner offices, and checkpoints originally set up within the province shall be abolished. (4) The locations where the special supervision offices are located may be attached with a transfer station, specializing in the transfer of special goods. (5) Special goods entering and leaving the transfer station must be in whole units and must not be sold within the province. (6) The general offices of the special supervision departments must report the quantity of opium entering and leaving each transfer station to the Hunan Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee on a monthly basis, and the committee will send personnel to inspect at any time. (7) All special goods must pass through designated routes and be transported out of the province under the supervision of the special supervision departments. Violators will be confiscated and destroyed. (8) Each transfer station must be established by the end of December of this year. Before the establishment, a certain earth bank in the location of the special supervision office may be temporarily designated as a substitute location, and all other earth banks shall be ordered to close. (9) From January 1, 1933, anyone found to be hiding opium outside of the transfer station will be confiscated and destroyed. (10) The deadlines stipulated in Articles 8 and 9 of these regulations may be implemented in the provincial capital in advance. (11) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. (12) These regulations shall be submitted by the Hunan Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee to the provincial government for record and shall be issued and implemented separately by letter. (October 16) Local Correspondence Songjiang:　　Reactions to the Numbering and Licensing of Fishing Boats: The Songfengjin Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry is actively carrying out the numbering and licensing of fishing boats, which has caused repercussions among more than 70 fishing boats from Chengdongwai to Huayang Bridge and Jiuliting in this city. The office sent personnel to notify the fishing boats to pay fees for licenses and numbering, with license fees ranging from two to three yuan. If the fees are not paid within the time limit, penalties will be imposed in accordance with regulations. Yesterday, the office sent personnel to the boats to expedite the payment of fees, which caused panic among the fishing boats. The fishermen gathered and requested Xu Chunbo, the head of Huayang Town, to appeal on their behalf. They argued that the families of the fishermen depended on the boats for their livelihood, and the fishing was only enough to make a living. This situation was very different from that of fishing fleets and large-scale fishing on the high seas. Imposing fees on the fishermen would be tantamount to depriving them of their livelihoods. The town head first tried to persuade them, but without success. They then went to the county government to petition. Secretary Tang received them and advised them to wait quietly for the government to resolve the matter and not to gather and riot. The county government then reported the situation to the Industry Department for instructions and sent a letter to the office to handle the matter carefully and avoid inciting incidents. It is reported that Chairman Cai of the County Chamber of Commerce also went to the county to appeal on behalf of the fishermen and telegraphed the Industry Department to petition. Changshu:　　Plasterer Dies in Fall From Roof On the afternoon of the 18th, the Zhou family of Chenjiashi, outside Xiaodongmen, hired a plasterer named Fan Er to repair the roof. Fan used a wooden ladder to climb onto the roof, but the footing below was unstable and caused a violent jolt. Fan fell from the roof, losing consciousness. Although Chinese and Western doctors were called to provide medical assistance, it was ineffective. He died at about 1:00 PM. The Zhou family reported the incident to Fan Er's family and requested the county government to send personnel to conduct an on-site inspection.　　Party and Government Meeting Sets Rent Amounts With the new grain harvest coming in, farmers and tenants will pay rent to landlords in rice. However, landlords often raise rent amounts and oppress farmers at will, leading to many disputes. The other day, a party and government meeting was held to decide that the rice industry association should report the daily market price of brown rice to the county government, which would then be published in newspapers so that both landlords and tenants could follow it. There should be no more raising or lowering of prices. If tenants pay rent in rice, landlords should not refuse in order to maintain the livelihood of farmers. Jiangyin:　　Owner of Dried Goods Store Conspires to Kill for Money Zhang Yisheng, the owner of Licheng Dried Goods Store in Shengang Town, west of the county, had a friend from a Changzhou sugar company, Zhang Jinda, who went to the store to collect payment on the last day of the lunar year last year. At that time, the Shanghai war was intense, and rumors were rampant. Zhang Yisheng harbored malicious intentions and secretly instructed Huang Fuda, a resident of the town, to use a pistol to kill Zhang in Diqiao. He then took the 1,800 yuan in payment. Wujin County then launched a rigorous investigation and consulted Cheng County for assistance. Recently, investigation team leader Huang Bingzhong obtained Huang Fuda, who confessed that Zhang Yisheng was the mastermind. The county government was notified to arrest Zhang, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Nantong:　　Chen Cheng Inspects Wounded Soldiers' Factory Chen Cheng, commander of the 18th Army, came to Nantong from Shanghai on the Dayu ship on the 18th. He arrived at Tianshenggang at noon and took a car to the clubhouse to rest. He then went to the 18th Army Wounded Soldiers' Factory in the west of the city to inspect it and summoned officers for instruction. Chen told reporters that running the wounded soldiers' factory was a passive way to help soldiers injured in the war and an active way to implement the military industry policy. It has been effective for more than a year and should still be expanded. Chen stayed in Nantong for one day and went to Shanghai on the 19th.　　Provincial Government Concludes Case of Borrowed Mules and Horses In the summer of this year, the 25th Route Army, led by Liang Guanying, went from Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, to Anhui Province. Due to transportation of supplies, the provincial government telegraphed 18 counties, including Nantong, to borrow 1,200 mules and horses, which were originally scheduled to be transported to Anhui. However, the provincial government recently sent clerk Chen to Shucheng to collect them, but only 67 were left, and they were all thin and sick. They were approved by the provincial government to be sold in Hefei, and some died along the way. A total of 425 yuan was sold. The provincial government has ordered each county to investigate and report that most of the mules and horses borrowed by Liang's army were unfortunately killed, and the remaining ones were too old and sick to be sold at a good price. All travel expenses, etc., of more than 260 yuan will be paid by the provincial government, and the proceeds from the sale will be distributed to the counties that were levied to settle the case. Wuxi:　　Bandits Rob Small Steamboat at Hualongjing The Hengfa small steamboat, from Liyang, of the Zhonghua Xinyu Steamboat Company, under the Gongyun Bridge outside the North Gate of this county, sailed from Wuxi to Liyang at 11:00 AM on the 16th, carrying more than 120 passengers. That night, when the steamboat was sailing through Hualongjing in Yixing County, several bandit boats suddenly appeared. Twenty to thirty bandits jumped onto the steamboat and carried out a large-scale robbery. None of the passengers on the steamboat were spared. A total of more than 2,000 silver dollars were robbed. After getting the loot, the bandits escaped on the original steamboat. Afterwards, Wang Fuye, the steamboat's accountant, and Meng Tian Zhang Huaicai ordered the driver to turn back and report the incident to the nearby water police and the Yixing County Government Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation. After the water police and others reported the incident, they immediately went out to pursue the bandits. Five bandits were captured at Gaochengkou and are scheduled to be sent to the Second District of the Wuxi Water Police today for questioning.　　Body of Man with Knife Wounds Discovered at Xianlidun Gang police Jin Pan of the 9th Precinct of the 4th District of the county, suddenly saw a pool of blood on Xianli Branch Road when he was on patrol. The gang police immediately searched the surrounding area and found a male corpse on the beach in Wu Yinsheng's mulberry field beside Xianlidun. The corpse was wearing a Japanese short shirt and blue cloth pants, and there was a stone about two feet long on his chest. The gang police searched elsewhere and found an axe in Wu Yueshan's public cemetery nearby. He immediately took the axe back to the station and reported the incident. At the same time, Feng Runsheng, the chief of the 35th and 35th districts, reported to the court, requesting an inspection. Yesterday (19th) at around 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen Li led the forensic examiner Wang and others to the countryside for an inspection. They found more than a dozen knife wounds on the back of the head, the left ear had been cut off, there was a knife wound about three inches long on the neck, and there were two iron weapon wounds on the back. It was determined that he was killed and his body was abandoned by the river. Since there were no family members, the chief was ordered to prepare a coffin and collect the body and wait for family members to claim it. Changzhou:　　Anti-Traitor Group Attempts to Assassinate Traitorous Merchant A group of more than 20 representatives from the silk and satin and other four industries associations in Qingguoxiang, Wuyi County, went to various stores at around 10:00 AM on the 18th to discuss issues such as unsealing enemy goods, national defense donations, and business taxes. While they were discussing, a young man with a letter walked straight into the meeting room, claiming that he had a letter for He Jinkun (He is the manager of Qingchangyu Silk and Satin Foreign Goods Store). He heard this and went out to see him. The young man said that they could go to a bright place in the courtyard to read it. He agreed to go to the courtyard. While he was opening the letter, the young man took out a wooden-cased gun from his side. He knew things were not good and stepped back. The young man fired two shots at him. One bullet passed through his sleeve and grazed his thumb, and the other bullet passed through the window frame and into the back of a chair without hitting him. The bullet did not exit. The representatives at the meeting were shocked when they heard the sound. They looked at the letter and realized that the young man had been sent by a branch of the Sworn to Kill Traitors Group. After He was injured, he went to the hospital for treatment. Danyang:　　Case of Wife Abuse Resulting in Death Occurs in Bicheng Zhu Jiada, a farmer in Shansha Village, Bicheng, was violent by nature. His son, Huixiang, married Sun Rongchun's daughter from Dinggang, Dantu County. The couple had a good relationship after marriage. Huixiang went out to do business. Last year, he closed his business and returned home. Due to the difficult life, his father gave him 1.2 mu of land to farm and make a living. This year, Huixiang was introduced by a relative to work as a clerk in a dried goods store in Chuping Town. His father wanted to take back the land he had given him. His wife, Sun, refused, and a conflict occurred, resulting in Sun being beaten to death. Sun's family rushed to the scene after hearing the news and found blue and purple injuries on her daughter's neck and face. While they were questioning, Jiada and his wife gathered a group of people and beat them up arbitrarily. Rongchun and his son were seriously injured and went to the county to report the incident. Cheng Shen took the forensic examiner to the scene for an inspection. Unexpectedly, Zhu Jiada's entire family had fled. His daughter-in-law's coffin had been carried to a remote wilderness for burial. Cheng Shen then ordered the villagers to work with the police to dig out Sun's coffin. The coffin was opened and it was found that Sun had strangulation marks on her neck and the lower part of her anus was broken. It was determined that she had been strangled to death and the body was abandoned by the river. He ordered that the body be buried and ordered an investigation into the murderer. Yangzhou:　　Gathering to Resist Rent, Released for County Trial Shi Wenbo, a citizen of Caowang, filed a complaint with the county government because tenants such as Shi Deyuan refused to pay rent. Unexpectedly, the tenants gathered to hold a meeting, put up slogans, and led by Shi Qixi and others, broke into Wenbo's oil mill and beat and injured two Jing guards, Gao Rongsheng and Shao Jinbiao, from the Fourth Precinct who tried to dissuade them. The Fourth Precinct Chief heard the news and sent more police.

He abducted and sold Youyan's 17-year-old daughter for more than 100 yuan and fled with her. After committing adultery, he went to Youyan's house and claimed that his cousin had left with him and they were now husband and wife.

(Educational News)　　(Important News) NCU President Luo Jialun Delivers Speech　　Forming an Organic National Culture (1)　　Without This Kind of Culture, There Can Be No Central Cohesion　　Hoping That Everyone Will Strive for National Survival　　At 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month, National Central University held its first memorial service of the semester. More than 1,000 faculty, staff, and students attended. President Luo Jialun presided over the ceremony and delivered a speech entitled "Forming an Organic National Culture." President Luo's speech has been organized and is as follows:　　During this time of severe national crisis, after a long period of academic suspension, we were able to actively prepare in the shortest possible time, resume classes in full, and have today's first general assembly. This is indeed of great significance to us. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the faculty and staff for their kindness. The old staff are willing to continue teaching, and the new staff have come to teach, concentrating their efforts on cultural construction in our capital's university. I, on behalf of National Central University, would like to express my sincere gratitude to you all.　　When I first came to NCU, I felt that the responsibility was too great, and I dared not take on the position rashly. Now that I have taken on this great responsibility, I am willing to work with you all to establish a new understanding of the mission of NCU. Because I believe that running a university is not just about handling ordinary administrative affairs. We must clearly understand the mission of a university and create a new spirit and foster a new atmosphere to achieve the university's mission to the nation. Now that China's national crisis is so severe, and the Chinese nation is facing a critical moment of life and death, our national university in the capital naturally has a special responsibility to the nation and the country. That is to undertake a special mission, and only then is there meaning in running this university. I think this mission is to establish an organic national culture for China. I believe that although the length of time that nationals stay may vary, this mission should be the permanent burden of National Central University.　　Originally, for a nation to be able to stand on its own and strive for existence, it must have its own national culture. This culture is the crystallization of the national spirit and the foundation for national solidarity and survival. If it lacks this culture, its country must lack the qualities of life, and its nation will inevitably be eliminated. The formal demise of a country is only the final result. Before that, it is due to the decline of the national culture and national spirit. Therefore, today's China is not only a political and social failure but most importantly lacks an overall national culture to revive the entire national spirit.　　We know that national culture is the manifestation of the national spirit, and the national university is the most important place to place the national culture. Lord Haldane, a modern British philosopher, once said: "In the university, the soul of a nation reflects its true image." It can be seen that if the university cannot shoulder the mission of creating a national culture, it will fundamentally lose the meaning of its existence and will be unable to lead a nation in cultural activities. If a nation cannot strive to create its own culture, it will inevitably perish and be replaced by others. As the saying goes, "If you have bells and drums, do not strike them; if you have a courtyard, do not sweep it; you are about to die, and others will protect it." The impact of this will not only lead to the nation's own destruction but will also make it impossible for future generations to continue creating their national culture, which will not be allowed by other nations. From another perspective, if a nation can strive to</p>

<h3>American Philanthropist Dr. Albert Brown Will Come to China</h3>
<p>Arriving in Peiping today and transferring to various places to investigate relief work.</p>
<p>His life has been dedicated to supporting charitable causes.</p>
<p>Dr. Albert Brown, currently the President of the American China Famine Relief Committee, is a great American philanthropist with longstanding friendship with China. In recent years, he has been particularly enthusiastic about raising funds to relieve disasters in China.</p>
<p>During the 1929 drought in the provinces of North China and last year's floods in the Yangtze River basin, the American China Famine Relief Committee, under the leadership of Dr. Brown, donated huge sums of money to the China International Famine Relief Commission for relief work. Now, Dr. Brown is leaving the United States on July 29th via Moscow to come to China to understand the relief work in our country firsthand. He will arrive in Peiping on the 20th of this month, stay for a few days, and then go to various places to investigate relief work. Dr. Brown is originally Jewish, born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He moved to the United States with his parents at a young age. His family was not wealthy. He started to support himself at the age of six. At seventeen, he was already dedicated to social work. During the European War, he worked with the current US President Herbert Hoover in Europe to assist in the relief of war refugees. Since that year, the United States has organized various European War fundraising rallies, most of which were presided over by Dr. Brown. The amount of relief funds raised and sent to Europe to aid refugees was enormous. He has also served as the President of various charitable organizations in Michigan and the President of fundraising associations across the United States, raising hundreds of millions of dollars. In 1919, Dr. Brown, at the request of a certain American institution, went to Ireland as a neutral observer to investigate the social and economic situation. As a result, he returned to the United States and raised $5 million to send to Ireland to aid refugees. At the beginning of 1922, Dr. Brown organized the American Relief Administration for Hoover to go to the disaster areas in Russia to investigate the disaster situation. In the second half of the same year, after returning to the United States, he traveled all over the United States to appeal for donations for the victims of the Russian disaster and the refugees of the European War. During his trip to Russia, Dr. Brown also investigated the issue of Jewish people immigrating to Russia. Dr. Brown also initiated the fundraising of $19 million. Currently, 200,000 Jewish people are living peacefully in Russia. Since 1928, he has been the President of the American China Famine Relief Committee. In 1932, he also served as the President of the American Relief Fund for China Flood Relief. The work of these two associations is carried out with the cooperation of prominent churches and leaders from all walks of life, invited by Dr. Brown. The Chinese disaster relief and construction projects that have been funded and assisted by him include the Satoru People's Livelihood Canal, the Shaanxi Jinghui Canal, the Northwest Work Relief, and the Anhui and Jiangxi Agricultural and Industrial Relief funds, etc. Dr. Brown has always expressed goodwill towards China. In 1916, he traveled to China with his wife. After returning to the United States, he not only wrote articles praising China, but also gave public speeches, praising the virtues of the Chinese people and stating that China's national future is certain to develop. Dr. Brown started his business in 1896. In the past 36 years, he has undertaken many businesses. Initially, he was engaged in the coal industry and founded the Albert Brown Coal Company. Later, he served as the Chairman of Broadway National Trust Company. From 1903 to 1910, he served as the General Manager of the American People's Ice Manufacturing Company. Later, he also served as the General Manager of the American Department Store Company and the Brownie Company. In addition, he also served as the Director of the Detroit City Commercial Development Bureau for seven years and the General Manager of the Detroit Aetocracraft Advertising Company for two years. The advertising company is now one of the largest advertising agencies in the United States. The famous "Detroit Times" in the Midwest United States was also founded by Mr. Brown and his comrades in the past.</p>

<h3>Baoyi Yan Fenglou and Others Telegram Again, Requesting Continued Urgent Repair of Embankment Works</h3>
<p>Baoshan County Fifth District Huiyuan Township Office telegram to the Provincial Office: Greetings to Chairman Gu of the Provincial Government and Director Dong of the Construction Department. The 125-zhang long embankment work at the north end of Yanchi North, Beishidong, Fifth District of this county is extremely dangerous. Once it collapses, the consequences will be unimaginable. We have already telegraphed you separately last month, requesting that personnel be sent to survey and estimate the costs for repairs. This matter concerns farmlands and the lives of the people, and it is related to the completed projects. If even one zhang becomes dangerous, then ten thousand zhang of work will be in vain. We hereby urgently present our request, begging your office to promptly approve and implement it. Respectfully submitted by Yan Fenglou, the Township Head of Huiyuan Township, Fifth District of Baoshan County, Deputy Township Head Li Fengming, and the entire township's residents. Sealed.</p>
<h3>All Zhejiang Public Association's Proposal for Rice Relief</h3>
<p>Telegraphic request to stop borrowing American wheat.</p>
<p>The All Zhejiang Public Association of this city, in view of the tragic fall in rice prices and the collapse of the rural economy, put forward a discussion at the board of directors meeting a few days ago. The relief measures were agreed upon as follows: 1. Request the Ministry of Finance to stop borrowing American wheat; 2. Request the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order all counties to handle grain storage locally as much as possible; 3. Advise all townships to organize public granaries; 4. Advise farmers to prepare one year's supply of rice. Hereby is the telegraphic request to stop borrowing American wheat, recorded below:</p>
<p>To Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: This year's farming is fortunately considered a moderate harvest, but the rice price has fallen tragically, which is unprecedented in more than ten years. Zhejiang Province has never been a rice-surplus area. Each stone is only sold for a little more than five yuan. In the same year, the silk sold in the spring was already suffering from low prices, and the autumn rice sale is also worthless. The livelihood of the people of Zhejiang depends entirely on the two harvests of spring and autumn, but the diligence of the year is not enough to compensate for the losses. The rural economy has completely collapsed, and society is in a state of decline. Extending it to the country, everyone is worried about the daily drop in rice prices and is trying to find ways to dredge and prevent restrictions in the hope of raising prices slightly as a measure to adjust the surplus. The Ministry also convened a national people's food conference and ordered the Central Government to allocate funds to purchase food in provinces where there is a surplus or where food prices are too low to benefit poor farmers and facilitate regulation. Various methods are in place, and we deeply appreciate your concern for the people's food. However, recently, the news reported that the government has made an agreement to borrow American wheat, which amounts to 450,000 tons, which is completely contrary to the above-mentioned methods. Last year, the purchase of American wheat on credit was signed at a higher price, and it was sold at a lower price, which caused too much loss. In addition, too much wheat was imported, and it was not easy to sell. There is still a surplus of relief flour in Anhui Province, which is a seizure of the national industry's sales channels. However, for the sake of disaster relief, the people did not dare to criticize it. This year, however, all provinces have a good harvest, and the national agricultural products feel too much. Foreign merchants are already trying to prevent the import of foreign rice and wheat, so why should the government order them themselves to compete with the domestic agricultural products and cut off their livelihoods? If provinces such as Guangdong and Guangxi still need to rely on foreign rice, then the Yangtze River basin is said to have a bumper harvest, and it should be possible to transport it there without worrying about the shortage. Why should we go to a foreign country to increase leakage and make the price of domestic rice never recover? The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the most important thing for the people. Both insufficient and excessive food can hinder the people's livelihood. At a time when foreign aggression is imminent and the Red disaster has not subsided, the people should support the government, but how can the government easily abandon its people? We pray that you will quickly cancel the proposal to borrow wheat. The people of Zhejiang will be very grateful, and the whole country will be very grateful. The All Zhejiang Public Association of Shanghai bows its head.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>American Consulate notifies the Municipal Government to allow entry.</p>
<p>The American Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, wrote to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that an American aircraft named "Spirit of the Game" will travel from Bangkok via Hanoi to Hong Kong on the 22nd of this month, and will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 23rd, staying for about a week before returning to China. Please cable the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs to allow its entry. The Municipal Government has already telegraphed to request instructions.</p>
<h3>Out-of-Bounds Road Construction Telephone Negotiation Will Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Negotiations have reached a considerable conclusion.</p>
<p>It can be signed in the near future.</p>
<p>Regarding the out-of-bounds road construction telephone negotiations, Mr. Xu Yuanfang, secretary of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, told the Central News Agency reporters yesterday that the negotiations are in progress, and the negotiations have reached a considerable result, so it can be signed in the near future. As for the report in the Japanese newspapers today that the Shanghai Telephone Company should pay the Municipal Government 10,000 yuan, it is not entirely accurate, because the Shanghai Telephone Company must pay a considerable amount of remuneration to the Municipal Government every year for operating public services in the designated area. The company is very clear about this, but the amount of payment has not yet been determined. As for the telephone problem in the Pudong area, it is not within the scope of the negotiations. All the telephone poles in the area have been repaired by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Rectification of Jiangbei Pig Tax</h3>
<p>Has ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to report.</p>
<p>The Business Tax Bureau of Jingru Tai Counties in Jiangbei illegally collected pig tax from passers-by. The Fresh Pig Association of this city reported the situation to the City Chamber of Commerce and telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to request a swift cancellation. The association now received a reply from the City Chamber of Commerce, Batch Allocation No. 294 of the Ministry of Finance, stating that it has learned of the matter regarding the Business Tax Bureau of Jingru Tai counties illegally collecting exorbitant taxes from passers-by. We requested a strict order to cancel. We have ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to rectify and report. Please be informed. This approval, pig industry representatives petitioned the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday.</p>
<h3>Temporary Representatives of Fresh Pig Industry Associations from Various Counties</h3>
<p>According to the report from the Jingjiang representative, the Business Tax Bureau of Jing, Ru, and Tai counties are actually detaining pig boats and collecting illegal business taxes. The situation is urgent. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00, representatives Wang Sheng, Xin Wenyao, etc. went to the City Chamber of Commerce to petition. The Secretary-General Zheng Dengqing received them. The representatives presented the situation of illegal collection by the tax bureau and presented a variety of evidence, requesting the association to assist in telegramming the Provincial Office to release the detained pig boats first to facilitate freight transportation, and to send personnel to lead them to petition in Beijing to achieve the purpose of cancellation as soon as possible. Secretary-General Zheng accepted them one by one, and then left.</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition Hall Open Day and Night</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the National Products Exhibition in this city, it has been very lively. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. Recently, viewers are still very enthusiastic. In addition to selling high-quality national products at low prices, various shopping malls also prepare tour tickets and distribute them to customers, so they are all three times more profitable. It is also said that the exhibition hall has been very crowded day and night recently. Many of the national products listed are exquisite. Among them, the Lighthouse brand powder fire extinguisher produced by the Xinguang Chemical Industry Society is of the best quality and has a good chance of winning an award.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association Requests Strict Punishment of the Culprit of Opium Planting</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, the warlords Chen Guohui and He Xianzhu, who forced opium planting in Fujian, have been arrested one after another, while Fang Shengtao and others are still at large. The association specially telegraphed Jiang Guangnai, the Pacification Director of the province, and Cai Tingkai, the Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, to shoot Chen, He and other rebels, and arrest Fang, Zhang and others to be interrogated. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>To Fujian Pacification Director Jiang, Commander-in-Chief Cai: Fujian Province is a rich and prosperous coastal province, which has been occupied and plundered by warlords, and its essence has been gradually lost. Since Fang Shengtao took office, the situation has become even more uncertain. The bandit-style troops stationed in southern Fujian, Chen Guohui, He Xianzhu, Hong Wende, Zhang Zhen, etc., are entrenched in the downstream counties, tyrannical and arbitrary, and there is no day in the sky. They forcibly collect land taxes and force opium planting. If there is any protest, they will be killed immediately. Distant events such as the Changle incident and recent tragedies such as the Dongsha massacre are not as bad as this even if strong neighbors are oppressing us. Even the rampant Red bandits are not as bad as this. Fang Shengtao, as the chairman of a province, not only does not issue orders to stop and punish the fierce and stubborn, but also colludes with them, helping them divide the spoils, and helping them poison the people. His crimes are more serious than those of the rebels, and his death is not enough to cover his guilt. Now, we are fortunate that you have shown the might of thunder and cleared away the filth of all kinds of ghosts and monsters. You have strictly declared a crusade. As soon as the righteous soldiers arrive, the ugly people will disappear, like the warm sun melting the spring frost, and like the strong wind sweeping the autumn leaves. This is truly an army that comforts the people and punishes the guilty, and a move to relieve the hanging. Your prestige has spread, and the whole province is rejoicing. Now that Chen rebel Guohui has already surrendered obediently, and the two villains He and Hong have also been arrested in Shantou, the people are overjoyed, and the public's anger has been quelled. Our association is heartbroken by the opium disaster in Fujian Province, which has been happening for more than one day. We have protested and fought for it for hundreds of times. We dare to ask you to quickly put Chen, He, Hong and other rebels to death by the most severe punishment in order to punish them for killing Dongsha and forcing the planting of opium seedlings, confiscate their ill-gotten gains, and use them to help disaster victims and promote agricultural prosperity. In addition, Fang Shengtao, the chief villain, and Zhang Zhen, who colluded with him, as well as all the officials involved in the opium planting case, should be arrested one by one and severely punished in accordance with the law. Do not let them drain the pond to catch fish, but leak the net that can swallow the boat, so that we can search according to the map and finally wave the hoe to dig out the leeks. The telegram is urgent, and we are extremely concerned. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association bows its head.</p>
<h3>British Scholar Mr. Paul Lund Lectures on Buddhism</h3>
<p>In recent years, there have been many people in Europe and America who believe in Buddhism. Dozens of books of Mahayana and Hinayana scriptures have been translated into Western languages. European and American scholars have risen up to study them, and they are generally recognized as the highest philosophy in the world. Mr. Paul Lund, Vice President of the British Mahabodhi Society, has been studying Buddhism for more than 30 years. He is now in China to investigate the situation of Buddhism. The Shanghai Buddhist Association specially invited him to lecture on Buddhism at the Jueyuan Auditorium on the afternoon of the 18th. On that day, the wind and rain were dark, but there were still hundreds of Chinese and foreign people who went to listen to the lecture. First, Master Mingdao and Mr. Ye Yuhu delivered introductory speeches, followed by Mr. Paul Lund's lecture, the topic of which was Buddhism as the Hope of the World. He briefly said that modern science has overthrown many religions, but the teachings of Buddhism cannot be overthrown. The more prosperous science is, the more intense the world's wars are, and the more dangerous human life is. Only Buddhism can fundamentally solve its ills. Buddhist teachings use precepts and concentration to cure greed, anger, and delusion, which is the ultimate way to eliminate the troubles of all beings. The original speech was very long, so it is not recorded here in full. Mr. Zhang Yun translated the speech on the side, and those who heard it were all satisfied.</p>
<h3>Sanyou Factory Workers Held a General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The future direction is determined to be legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Organize a propaganda team to publish a general meeting declaration.</p>
<p>The labor-capital dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company's cessation of the Yinxiang Port factory has not been resolved since the local court ruled to uphold the original decision. Although the company has appealed, the dispute is still unresolved. Although the unemployed workers relief association, the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, the Chinese Red Cross, and Du Yuesheng, the director of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, have donated relief funds, it is difficult for the workers to maintain their livelihood. The Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union held a general meeting of all members at the Yinxiang Port factory at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. 744 workers attended, as well as Dai Youheng of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union. The meeting was attended by the Third Squadron of the Factory Police Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, a squad of armed police, and inspectors and detectives. The meeting was chaired by Gong Yuting, Xia Zhongzhao, and Bao Boyi, the standing directors of the labor union. The atmosphere was very tense. After the chairman and the departments reported on their work, the discussion began. (1) The direction of future progress was decided to be legal resolution. (2) The question of what to do when all the rice is eaten and it is still not possible to solve the problem and there is no way to find a solution was discussed and decided as follows: (A) Request the municipal government to take full responsibility for the workers' food and clothing before the dispute is resolved.

<h3>Dancer's Family Murdered</h3>
<p>Mother and adopted son both dead.</p>
<p>Two younger sisters severely injured and lives in danger.</p>
<p>Dancer Wang Yiying is a suspect.</p>
<p>Cantonese woman Liang Xiuzhen, 15 years old, and Li Huiqing, 22 years old, are both dancers at the Anle Palace Dance Hall. They both live on the upper floor of No. 263 Changyuan Lane, Haining Road. The two of them go to the dance hall every night around 7 pm and return home to sleep around 4 am the next morning. This is their daily routine. There are also four other people in their home: Xiuzhen's mother (Liang Li, 45 years old), younger brother (Zilun, 14 years old), younger sister (Qiaolan, 10 years old), and Huiqing's adopted son (Dong Liguang, 8 years old). Around 1 am yesterday morning, Liang Xiuzhen and Li Huiqing were in the dance hall when four people in their home were stabbed severely with sharp blades. The murderer fled the scene and disappeared. Afterwards, someone reported to the Hongkou Police Station, and West Detective Na Aituohua, detectives Bai Mingfu, Feng Shuofu, and others were dispatched to investigate. They saw that the items in the room were extremely messy, and the four injured people were lying in pools of blood. There were no murder weapons. Only a washbasin was full of bloody water, presumably caused by the murderer washing it. The detectives used an ambulance to send the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment. At that time, Liang Li and Dong Liguang died due to their serious injuries. The other two are still being treated, and their lives are also in danger. The two corpses were taken to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Around 10 am, the First Special District District Court commissioned Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to inspect the corpses at the site. They took up the case. First, West Detective Na Aituo reported the situation he found at the time. Then, according to Liang Xiuzhen, the six of them lived in Changyuan Lane, Haining Road. She was a dancer at Anle Palace. Her mother and others were stabbed to death this morning, and she was not at home. Her family usually has girlfriends coming and going. In the dance hall, she dances with Westerners. Only a Shaoxing man named Wang Yiying had a deep hatred with her mother and others. Because there was a war in Shanghai, she and others took refuge in the Yadong Hotel, and that's when she met him. At that time, he saw that Li Huiqing was beautiful and wanted to marry her, but her mother and Li both refused, etc. According to Li Huiqing, she is a dancer, and Liang Li is her adopted mother. Dong Liguang is someone else's son given to her. Wang Yiying wanted her to marry him, but she really didn't want to. Therefore, two weeks ago, he wrote her a letter, which was full of threatening words. Now his whereabouts are unknown. At the time of the incident, she and Xiuzhen were both in the dance hall, and she only found out after someone reported it, etc. After obtaining the confessions, Mr. Zhan instructed that the deceased Liang Li, female, and Dong Liguang, male, had been fatally stabbed in the head and face with sharp blades. Liang Li's body was handed over to her daughter Liang Xiuzhen to receive the coffin and shroud. Dong Liguang's body was handed over to Li Huiqing to receive the coffin and shroud. It was found that Wang Yiying was a major suspect, and the police station was ordered to strictly arrest him and bring him to justice for questioning.</p>
<h3>Chinese-Style Sailing Junk's Global Voyage Feat</h3>
<p>Charting the sea along the way.</p>
<p>Complete the voyage in eighteen months.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that a Frenchman, Mr. Blanc, accompanied by five people, sailed a Chinese-style sailing junk from Hankou on the first of this month, planning to circumnavigate the globe and chart the sea. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday (18th) and docked in front of the Nan City Qiuxin Factory. The ship was custom-made in Ningbo, painted in red, white, and blue, and flew the French flag. The ship was equipped with an 18-horsepower turbine engine to supplement the lack of sail power, and also equipped with a radio to receive telegrams and broadcasts. He now plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days to complete all the necessary procedures at the French Consulate General, and then take four months' worth of food and set off for Manila. Then, he will replenish his food and go to Australia via the South Pacific Islands. It is said that he will chart the islands along the way, so the period is set for a long time. It usually takes two weeks to reach the Philippines from Shanghai, but the ship carries four months' worth of food. After arriving in Australia, he plans to sail to the Strait of Magellan, then to the east coast of South America, and back to Europe via the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. He estimates that it will take about 18 months to complete the voyage. This is a pioneering feat.</p>

<p>Unspeakable Suffering in a Garret</p>
<p>In the garret, he was writing. Mother Li pushed the door open and came in.</p>
<p>[Mr. Gao! Grandma Tang—that is, his landlady—said...]</p>
<p>[Said what?]</p>
<p>[She said that Mr.'s rent is more than three months in arrears; if you don't pay it, she will...]</p>
<p>[Will what? Kick me out, is that it?] He jumped up in a rage.</p>
<p>[No... no... is...] Mother Li was startled, and her voice trembled a little.</p>
<p>[Go, tell her to come and talk to me in person.] He generously took out two small coins from his pocket. [This is for you.]</p>
<p>While declining, she said: [No, Mr. Gao! I don't want it; this is for you to use.] But the two small coins were tightly held in her palm.</p>
<p>Now his property only had two small coins left.</p>
<p>Grandma Tang, as fat as a pig, came up from the stairs. She was a woman in her thirties, dressed very beautifully, with traces of flirtation still lingering on her face.</p>
<p>[Do you have money today, Mr. Gao! You owe me more than three months' rent; if you don't pay it, I will really have to starve.]</p>
<p>[This afternoon or tomorrow I'll give it to you!]</p>
<p>[Tomorrow is a long way off!]</p>
<p>[This time I'll really give it to you.]</p>
<p>[Really? Can you guarantee it? I don't think so,] she said, with a cold laugh.</p>
<p>[Definitely.]</p>
<p>[Then, I believe your words.]</p>
<p>Watching her fat figure go down, he spat and said bitterly but softly:</p>
<p>[Starve? You eat so much fish and meat every day that you're as fat as a pig!]</p>
<p>But the curses from downstairs faintly reached his ears. [This poor wretch, this rascal, always postponing, owing more than three months' rent, and still doesn't want to pay. Hmph! If he doesn't pay, I'll see if I don't kick him out.]</p>
<p>Sadly, [Alas! From now on, I won't even be able to afford a garret.]</p>
<h3>A Corner of Society: This Kind of Examination by Kang Shi</h3>
<p>It was probably the summer before last! I was studying English at the XX English Morning School on North Sichuan Road. There were thirty or forty students. Here, I discovered a surprising thing. Recalling it today, I feel it is also a sign of social decay. Recalling it today, I feel it is also a sign of society.</p>
<p>On such a lovely summer morning, with a cool breeze blowing, it was very refreshing, the perfect time to study! In the classroom of the North Sichuan Road English Morning School, there were several of us students studying English. When there was no class, a certain classmate walked into the classroom with a smile and said to me:</p>
<p>[In a few days, I'm going to the government office to handle some matters!] And he took out a few pages of red-lined paper for me to see. Written on it were the examination questions for the government office, like Party Principles! Physics! Arithmetic! General Knowledge! There were many!</p>
<p>I didn't quite understand, and asked that classmate a certain: [What is going on?]</p>
<p>He replied: [These exam questions were given to me by my relative. Now I am asking someone to do them for me, so that I can take the exam when the time comes!]</p>
<p>I said in surprise: [Is there such a thing? Before the exam, the questions are already in your hands. With such malpractices, no wonder it is difficult for outsiders to get in, no matter what the exam is!]</p>
<p>A certain classmate also said in agreement: [What are the exams like now? It completely depends on connections and familiarity!]</p>
<p>I couldn't help but sigh repeatedly, when suddenly the ringing of the bell interrupted our conversation, and we paid attention to the books!</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Saving Agriculture</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have plummeted, causing panic in rural areas. The government and the public are calling for help, but effective relief measures are lacking, making the situation increasingly difficult. This highlights the fundamental problems of the entire rural economy and the seriousness of their nature. Our monthly magazine previously invited experts on rural issues to brainstorm ideas, and the record of these discussions was published in the fourth issue. However, we did not expect the catastrophic fall in rice prices to come like a sudden storm, further accelerating the rapid collapse of rural areas.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the post office, farmers account for 72% of the total population in our country. Approximately 320 million farmers reside in rural areas. Given the rudimentary state of statistical methods in our country, the unreliability of these figures is expected. Nevertheless, regardless of the exact numbers, our country has historically been based on agriculture, and farmers constitute the vast majority of our national population. Therefore, the suffering of farmers can be said to be the suffering of the majority of the people. As Mr. Ye Gongchuo stated at a lecture hosted by our monthly magazine: "[The rural problem in our country today is the rural problem revealed during the process of the national economy moving towards true bankruptcy.]" Therefore, the severity of the current rural problem is actually a harbinger of national economic collapse. The phenomenon of cheap grain hurting farmers, caused by the current drastic drop in grain prices, is merely a tragic symbol revealed within this ominous sign.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for the catastrophic drop in rice prices, many have already discussed them: the inflow of foreign grain (such as the large-scale import of American wheat last year), the difficulties in domestic transportation, the heavy demands of local authorities, the exploitation of excessive taxes, the stagnation of rural finance, the oppression of usurious loans, and the prevalence of bandits, thugs, corrupt officials, and lazy bureaucrats, etc. All of these factors contribute to the catastrophic drop in rice prices. Taking a further look, these are also factors that indicate the entire rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. According to customs statistics, the value of grain imported by our country last year amounted to a huge sum of over 26,300,000 yuan, becoming a major part of our country's trade deficit. Our rural economy has already entered a period of being directly controlled by international capitalism. On the other hand, the urban economy is becoming increasingly concentrated. In Shanghai alone, it is said that there are over 500 to 600 million yuan in circulating capital. Although the banking industry in Shanghai is currently booming, in reality, apart from engaging in speculative real estate operations, it offers hardly any valuable services. Meanwhile, farmers in the interior cannot even obtain high-interest loans of around 3-5%. With such a distorted situation, the general trend is to force our hardworking farmers to become destitute and displaced, with the old and weak dying in ditches and the strong resorting to desperate measures. Now, even with good harvests, prices are low, and cheap grain harms farmers. The perilous situation is enough to shake the foundations of the nation. At a time when foreign aggression is pressing and national disasters are mounting, the collapse of the rural economy will inevitably accelerate the demise of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, when discussing the rural problem today, it is no longer a peripheral social issue but an integral political one. Rescuing the bankrupt rural economy is also saving the nation from danger. Therefore, we should urgently concentrate the minds and efforts of the entire nation, both to resist strong enemies from abroad and to support rural areas internally. However, these two points alone are not easy to achieve. Moreover, the current political chaos is precisely the root cause of the severity of the rural problem. Attempting to only urgently relieve rural areas without first putting politics on the right track suffers from the logical fallacy of reversing cause and effect. Furthermore, regarding the strategies for rescuing rural areas, experts have repeatedly emphasized both short-term and long-term solutions. However, the greatest difficulty lies in how to implement them and, more importantly, how to implement them without encountering obstacles. If politics is not on the right track, then everything will be illusory. Short-term measures are not a long-term solution, and empty words are of no practical use. Therefore, the most fundamental aspect of a rural relief plan, in a nutshell, is: how to put politics on the right track. Now, the disaster in Shandong has not yet ended, and the chaos in Sichuan has risen again. The Northeast has already been submerged in destruction, and the situation on the Tibetan border is becoming increasingly critical. Yet, the central government's unity is not strong, and the Southwest is showing signs of disaffection. In such a scattered, fragmented, and disintegrating situation, seeking to put politics on the right track is extremely difficult, let alone saving agriculture. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel a mixture of grief and sorrow. Telegraphic News</p>
<h3>Tang Juwu's Troops Vigorously Resist the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Occur in the Huanren Yingpan Area</p>
<p>Various Anti-Japanese Allied Armies Decide on Joint Measures</p>
<p>Tang Juwu's Troops Deploy on Three Sides</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources from Shenyang, the Japanese Kwantung Army has dispatched the 11th Division from Fushun to launch a general offensive against Tang Juwu's forces in the fourteen counties of eastern Liaoning. Tang's forces have deployed on three sides: northwest, south, and (1) The western route is commanded by Li Chunrun, the commander-in-chief of the 6th Route Army, leading the cavalry guard and the independent 1st and 2nd Brigades to guard the area east of Yingpan along the Malianling mountain range to block the Japanese troops coming from Shenyang and Fushun. (2) The southern route is commanded by Li Chunguang, the commander of the 4th Route Army, in coordination with Guo Jingshan stationed in Huanren and Zhang Zongzhou's two route armies in Ji'an to deploy along the Yalu River from Huanren to Andong to block the Japanese troops coming from Korea. (3) The northern route is commanded by Wang Fengge, the commander-in-chief of the three route armies stationed in Shanchengzhen, to prevent the advance of Japanese troops coming from the Jihai and Fenghai routes. After the general offensive on the 11th, Li Chunrun's western route troops used the Big Swords Society to charge, luring the Japanese troops to the Shangxia River area east of Yingpan, and then sent troops to encircle the Japanese behind, destroying the tram tracks from Qianjinzhai to Celianzui. The Japanese troops were attacked by the Big Swords Society and the Self-Defense Army all day long and retreated in a panic. On the 13th, the Yingpan station was captured by the Self-Defense Army, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. On the 14th, the Japanese army concentrated in Qianjinzhai to prepare for a counterattack. The Japanese troops coming from Korea via the southern route crossed the river and occupied Ji'an County. The Self-Defense Army set up defenses along the northern mountainous area of Huanren County, and Li Chunguang's troops harassed the Japanese army's rear in Andong via Kuandian. The northern route army happened to come into contact with Yu Zhishan's rebel troops, who were repeatedly defeated, and their soldiers were terrified. The Japanese troops were unfamiliar with the terrain and were repeatedly annihilated by our army. The rumor that the Japanese army occupied Tonghua is not accurate. (Special Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, Muto Nobuyoshi of the Japanese Kwantung Army dispatched a division to attack Tang Juwu's troops in the eastern border area, but has not yet succeeded due to the ingenious tactics of the resistance army. (Special Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Various Anti-Japanese Allied Armies Take a Blood Oath of Alliance</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Various anti-Japanese allied armies have united and decided to unite to resist Japan. On the 15th, Cui Desheng, commander of the 1st Route Army, Ma Shijin of the 2nd Route, Qin Fengshan of the 3rd Route, Cheng Changkui of the 4th Route, Lu Longguang of the 5th Route, and Zhu Pengxiang of the 6th Route, convened a meeting in Xiaocheng Village, sixty li west of Jin County, to discuss joint measures, took a blood oath of alliance, and vowed to resist Japan with one heart and one mind. They have now completed their discussions and returned to their defensive positions, and will soon launch a large-scale attack on the Japanese army. (Special Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Quan's troops of the 6th Route Army are currently in contact with the Liaoyang militia, using Beilingzi as a base and frequently engaging with the Japanese garrison. (Special Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
