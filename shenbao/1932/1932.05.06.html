<h3 id="c1">上海停戰協定與東北問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>翰</p>
<p>上海停戰協定。巳於昨日簽字矣。</p>
<p>此次停戰會議。經無數之曲折。至昨日而始獲一結束。其協定所昭示我人者。曰上海正式停戰。曰確定日軍之退駐地點。以爲停戰保障。至於撤兵。則仍未有期。協定之結果。如是而巳。此次停戰會議之必無好果。早爲國人所共料。惟我當局於國難會議報告外交方針時。曾謂「政府在一定限度以下要忍受。逾限度即不能忍受。」然則昨日協定之簽字。其即表示在可以忍受之限度内矣。</p>
<p>日本於問題。非局部問題也。上海問題爲東北問題之延長。而爲日本侵略我國之整個問題的一部。東北問題一日不解决。則上海問題縱於一時求得解决。而爲患將仍無巳時溯一二八禍變之起。識者皆知日本欲藉聲東擊西之計。期轉移世界目光於上海。而怠忽東北。果也。一月之滬戰。頓使諸友帮對斯國際貿易中樞之上海。憂慮無極。於是而調停。而會議。而僵局。而轉圜。惝恍迷離。莫如所屆。而我國民亦皆注目於上海一問題。棄置東北問題於不顧。</p>
<p>日本造成一二八上海之禍變。其原意固在轉移世界之目光。然亦初不料戰局竟致如此之延長。更不料世界輿論對日之愈益惡化。於是日本不得不謀所以打破此難關。其在國聯之折衝基點。謀打破東北問題與上海問題之聯鎖。日本深知列强對於上海經濟中心之關係重大。必不肯袖手膜視。故落得運用手腕於錯雜離奇之上海停戰會議。俾達到打開聯鎖之目的。</p>
<p>上海之停戰會議。旣緊握此轉移世界目光。與打開聯鎖難關之兩點。盡全力以謀應付。甚至唐突國聯。激怒小國。亦毫不介意。故今日停戰協定之簽訂。實爲日本外交政策之大成功。</p>
<p>國人乎。停戰協定簽字以前。日本在東北之種種佈置。非巳日益猛晋乎。慫恿僞國之成立。消滅義軍之企圖。以及阻撓調查團之行動等等。非在協定簽字以前一一實行者乎。停戰協定簽字以後。日本將益專心一致以策劃東北。</p>
<p>而東北益危。</p>
<p>故今當爲國人告者。停戰協定。雖巳簽字。上海問題。則仍難了結。願我國人幸勿因此委曲可憐之結局。而忘以後多難之上海。更勿因上海一時可以苟安。而置永將淪亡之東北於腦後。</p>

<p>因避監視每在自國領館會客</p>
<p>顧代表與日記者談話之一斑</p>
<p>瀋陽特約通信、國聯調查團抵瀋後、休息一日、二十三日正式訪問日本駐瀋代理總領事森島守人氏、對於九一八事變發生前後之經過、及中日關係與鐵道平行線問題、有所詢問、森島對於前任東北官吏、指爲昏庸不法、大放厥詞、二十四日、該團又正式訪問關東軍司令本莊繁氏、本莊氏設宴欵待、以後雙方每日會談二三小時、亦爲九一八事變發生之研究、李頓爵士·克勞待將事·麥考益少將、曾提出種種疑問、如次一鐵道之細微、何須有如此範圍廣大之戰爭、又在北平所聞自前任東北長官張學良者、顯與日方所述不同爲言、日方則强行辯護、且提出所謂證據也者、</p>
<p>調查團之滯留於此、似有下列三原因、（一）國聯行政院定五月一日開會、期前必須作成第一報告、（二）關於長春吉林齊齊哈爾及錦州等地之戰事、尙須與關東軍司令官會談、（三）哈爾濱以北交通、非常困難、爲安全計、行程尙待研究、</p>
<p>各委員爲便利及自由起見、每在自國領事館會客、開會及作報告、則在英領事館、連日有所謂農民代表、鮮民代表、及日滿報界代表者、紛紛晋謁、該團均派員接見、收受其聲明書而巳、</p>
<p>中國代表處人員、分寓大和東方二旅館、出入有探員偕行、名爲保衛、顧代表日與調查團接洽、並與外交部通聲息、工作亦至忙、僅薄暮時、或至千代田公園及春日町散步而巳、二十三夜、駐瀋各國領事在大和旅館開盛大之交誼會、以歡迎調查團、顧代表雖在被邀之列、但以在國難期中、從未與人跳舞、至代表處其他人員、每日必至大和旅館二二一號室集議、互相報告見聞、</p>
<p>調查團之報告、今明可發至日内瓦、北上之期、巳預定爲星期一、（五月二日）行程擬長春留一日、吉林當日來回、哈爾濱留七日、齊齊哈爾二日、以後則臨時决定、顧代表力爭黑河不可不往、此去除哈爾濱外、均無大旅館、交通不便之處、且須乘飛機、故隨行人員、非大减特减不可、中國方面、大約至多六七人、至熟悉吉省情形之張偉斌氏、同至長春即歸、熟悉黑省情形之楊承基氏、同至哈爾濱即歸、以後續有减少、亦未可知、其餘人員、除留一二人在瀋陽照管行李外、一律同時經大連回北平、至報界同行者、此次本有三人　茲巳用拈　之法、由鮑靜安氏一人代表前往、</p>

<p>顧代表抱大無畏之精神、毅然來此、故其一言一行、皆成報紙上資料、四月二十二日下午四時半、在瀋陽大和旅館、應日本新聞記者之請、正式接見、其問答頗饒趣味、錄之以博一粲、</p>

<p>上月二十八日、蔡廷楷軍長、在蘇州楓橋、　六十師官兵訓話云、各官長士兵們、今天你們的師長、要我來和你們說話、你們有好多是新加入來的、但對於操塲上的軍紀軍容　都能整齊嚴肅這是軍長覺得很滿意的、你們新加入來的、現在巳做了十九路軍的武裝同志了、你們在未加入以前、爲什麽要加入這個團體、巳加入後　應該怎樣做個十九路的優秀份子、你們都要深切了解的、你們或者許因一時迫於愛國𤍠忱、所以踴躍地投到本路軍來　初不了解從軍的意義、從軍的意義怎樣、第一就要抱定宗旨、獻身國家、不顧本身的利害、其次就要有所準備、軍事智識與技能、有了軍事上的準備、才能運用所有的智識和技能、以達到從軍的目的、保國衛民　這樣從軍才有意義　才可爲十九路軍的忠實同志、也才配稱爲革命軍人　我國現有的軍隊、除兩廣東北雲貴川不計外、共有陸軍九十師、這樣驚人的常備兵額、實爲現代任何國家所未有、在軍隊的數量上來看、宜乎中國的國防、應該很鞏固了然而事實並不如是、東三省巳被日本毫不費力的拿去了、接着日本又侵略淞滬　當一二八事變發生後、和他抵抗的僅有我十九路和第五軍　本來中國有百餘師的（兩廣等在内）常備兵　爲什麽僅有兩部份兵力和日軍作戰呢、說來　原因很長很複雜、槪括的話　我國自從亡淸種下腐敗的根源後、對於國防沒有設備、軍隊缺少嚴格的整理和訓練　交通不便、匪共猖獗、所以弄到日方增加陸軍兵力十萬以上、前綫激戰得最吃緊時、仍是十九路與第五軍在苦力支持、其他各地軍隊都因情格勢禁、莫能應援終於便我們不能不退守第二防綫、假使中國内容不會這樣腐敗、能以現有百餘師之一半兵額、與暴日相周旋的話、雖不能說什麽直搗東京、最低限度、也可保全我領土　不致失尺土寸地於暴日、我們總想平日衣食住以及一切供應、都是民脂民膏、今對内不能絶對保護治安、對外不禦侮衛國、說來軍長是很慚愧　你們當亦有同樣的感想　可是我們慚愧就算了事嗎　我們以此未死之身　應該怎樣發奮踔厲　俟機殺退暴寇恢復失地　以去除我内心的慚愧呵　你們新加入來的同志　巳願赤膽忠心　做個良好革命軍人　應如何加强我們的力量、爲對外犧牲的準備、此次十九路軍及我親愛的第五軍　在滬作戰、犧牲雖大、但是全體官兵、捨身報國的信念、愈益堅强、不稍餒怯、這是軍長很足安慰的、說到本路軍的軍餉　在這襄我不妨將本路軍的軍需狀况　簡略的報告一下、本路軍自去年六月　在江西擔任第三期剿匪後、所有軍餉　改由中央直接發放　（去年六月以前是由廣東在國稅項下就近支撥○原定每月一切行軍作戰費用及餉項、共支一百萬元　但實領不到八成、十一月後减爲五十萬　卒因中央財政困難、截至今年三月止、實際平均每月僅領到三十餘萬元　試想你們一師每月索餉若干、此區區三十餘萬的數目怎樣去分配　你們有沒有想到個中的困難、自從一二八上海事變發生後　臨時軍費突增、我們却能方方佈置　又要接濟友軍　除中央撥來每月三十餘萬之外、這些錢是那襄來的、你們大槪也曉得　這都是滬粤各界同胞及各埠僑胞、以汗血金錢、𤍠烈輸助的呵、我們抵抗暴日侵略　怎樣鉅大犧牲　都是分内事、我們并不是以血肉來沽名、更不是爲誰作工具　我們是本着天良由内心的發動、去爲中國種族生存而犧牲　民衆過分的帮助　我們委實覺得慚感交并在這次作戰中　以至奉命撤退後　你們竟間有不能嚴格遵守紀律　騷擾同胞的事情　事雖瑣碎、但這種行爲、我覺得比什麽事還要痛心還要難過、還有傷兵在醫院滋事、他們以爲受了傷、可以驕起來了　這些毫無智識的動作　委實令人痛恨　軍人受國家豢養、戰死沙塲、是應該的　負了傷就可以驕了嗎、聞在上海有少數傷兵跑到租界上去滋事、被外國巡捕棍打脚跌到死去活來再丢了租界外去的、以堂堂中國軍人、不死於沙塲、而受外人踐踏得這樣地步、這就足表現中國軍人沒有敎育　不知自愛　你們是有血性的　能忍受這樣的恥辱嗎　嗣後所有負傷十兵、應絶對守紀律　否則我要極嚴厲的懲辦　這是你們在紀律上、予我以不良的感相　要你們深切注意加以改正的、其次說到我國國民程度的幼稚　個人主義和家族觀念的普通與深人、實造成今日國家衰弱的總因　因爲敎育不普及、廣大民衆、多沒有受敎育的機會、弄到不識字的達全人口百分之八十以上、國民程度、巳因未受敎育而幼稚、又加以幾千年來傳統的家族觀念、特别濃厚、所以一般國民除認識家族以外、幾乎不知國家爲何物、全國情形是如此、怎能致國家於富强、此次我軍與暴日在淞滬激戰最烈時、江西的赤匪不特不能爲國難所激醒、以合力禦外、反乘機猛攻、贛州、企圖奪取贛南重要城市、以搗亂我後方、這種行爲、不啻爲暴日張目、爲其内應、我們知道、日本或其他國内、也是有共產黨的、然而彼則不願乘其國家有事之秋、在内搗亂、以分其政府對外的力量、在兩相比較之下、就足知中國國民程度的怎樣了、所以中國欲根本圖强、非普及國民敎育、把國家觀念提起來不可、我們顯以本身爲全國倡、犧牲家族、犧牲自我、將整個的身體貢獻與國家、永久做國家的及人民的工具、這是軍長要和大家互相勉勵的最重要的一點、希望你們身體力行</p>

<p>異發跛足　馬膝下繁衍、子女甚多、伯仲叔季均成人、第五子名異發、年十五、跛一足、六子順發、年十二、另一子名永福、年十三、此三子同在公共租界北海路格致公學讀書、每日早晚、均用自備之第二六二號汽車來往接送、僱用本地人夏寳生（年五十六歲）夏順德（年二十三歲）父子爲汽車夫、夏另居於打鐵浜蒲柏路四三三號、按日早去晚歸、服務甚勤、深得主人信任、</p>
<p>綁匪突臨　昨晨七時半、汽車夫夏寳生循例駕車擬送小主人等入校、當時將車停在後門外、異發等三人魚貫走上汽車、詎甫經坐定、夏寳生正在踏動引擎之際、突由馬路對面福慶里及歸安里一弄弄口衝出口操北音之綁匪四人、兩執盒子砲、兩執手槍、兩匪先將車之左右兩門扼守、餘兩匪奔向汽車夫、</p>
<p>車夫殉主　際此千鈞一髮、車　　夫夏寳生見勢不妙、情知遇匪、急將車門上裝置之暗鎖反手鎖住、一面大聲呼救、匪等再三撬動車門上之握手、卒不能推動毫末、匪等情急、遂用槍柄將玻璃擊碎、意欲探手開門、夏乃奮臂抵抗、匪更焦急、即向夏開放一槍、彈中右胸乳部、洞穿後背、當塲倒斃車内、</p>
<p>架走肉票　匪等旣將車夫擊斃、一面急將車門開啓、將異發拽出車廂、架上預停於寗波路附近之匪車内、由一匪司機、開足速力、逃逸無踪、當時馬之家人早巳聞警、急一面電話報告嵩山路捕房、一面狂鳴警笛、一面由男女傭僕趕出將汽車内之順發與永福兩孩抱出、但兩孩因年幼胆小、目睹車夫被擊、兄長遭綁、早巳呆若木雞、面無人色矣、</p>
<p>鉅價鑽戒　移時該管嵩山路捕房及特别機關中西探捕、均先後趕到、四面兜捕、奈匪等早巳遠颺無踪、當向鄰近店舖詢問綁匪服式面貌一過、歸報捕頭、一面派探將夏寳山尸體舁送同仁輔元分堂騐尸所、候今日報請法院派院檢騐、聞異發年幼聽慧、頗得父母鍾愛、被綁時、手指上戴有價値一千三百五十元之金鋼鑽戒一只、惟異發於八年前、曾被匪綁架一次、居匪窟兩月、嗣經法捕房援救出險、昨日肇事後捕房查得馬家新近停歇之保標張治華跡涉嫌疑、曾傳案訊問一過、着交妥保候核、并由捕房通知公共租界捕房及華界公安局查緝匪踪、故昨晚公共租界方面檢查行人、及盤詰汽車、甚形嚴密、</p>

<p>昨見報載，有兩件事情，這種事情，在萬惡的社會裏，丨尤其是上海丨原可以常常看到，處處看到，今日所說，不過僅借一例。</p>
<p>（一）少女楊杏英，因爲旗袍腰身太寬的緣故，致母女發生口角，負氣投浦，得輪船茶房遇救，就此失身。</p>
<p>（一）祁仍奚家庭糾紛一案，祁平日窮奢極欲，揮金如土，姊妹雙鵰，互相競耀，以致凶終𨻶末，結果如斯，令人浩歎。</p>
<p>試問（一）旗袍腰身太寬一些，有什麽關係，何至投浦自盡。（二）一個家庭，如此揮霍無度，端不能免慘敗的一日，這種罪恶，無一非社會造成，此兩人我可說是現社會的兩個代表者，諸如此類，無可勝數。</p>
<p>溯自辛亥革命以來，處處效法歐美，至於近日，此風更甚，本來自五口通商以後，大門早巳打破，天然不能再守閉關主義，但效法歐美，當效歐美的好處，不當效歐美的壞處，現在歐美的好處，一些不曾學得，而歐美的壞處，可說件件皆能。</p>
<p>例如代議制度，歐美行之多年，不能說是絶對無弊，但總算是利多害少的一種善良制度，一到我國，就是包辦，賄選，欽派·威迫·種種惡劣現狀發生，至於現代女子，喜跳舞，看電影，疊胸蕩服，奇形怪狀，招搖過市，男子則西裝革履，談自由，談戀愛，談歐化，裝漂亮，這都是他們的生活目的。</p>
<p>因此靑年子女，生活即非常增高，而生產能力，毫無基礎，天天望機會之偶得，幸運之蒞臨，一朝得志，便可住洋房，坐汽車，驕其妻妾，種種妄念，盤旋腦際而不能去，一不得志，則侘傺無聊，抑鬱不遇，所謂「痴子望天坍，窮人望民反」，而回視舊式的家庭，一如樊籠之畜猛獸，監獄之囚暴徒，於是正路勿由，多跑歧路。</p>
<p>善良的政府，須先有善良的社會，而善良的社會，尤須有善良的政府爲之提倡，現在國帑如洗，而驕奢淫逸之風日恣，國民之生產力幾等於零，而西洋化摹仿無微不至，國家多難，而社會現象若此，尙何言丨尙何言丨</p>

<p>維他命（Ｖｉｔａｍｉｎｓ）這個名詞，常常在現代的書籍上可以發現，但是牠到底是什麽東西呢？恐怕有許多人還是有些恍惚。維他命是食物裏面所含一種神秘的，看不見的，嗅不着的的東西，我們每天的生活中，是少不了牠的；因爲缺少了牠，我們便會孱弱，生病而至於死亡。</p>
<p>據科學家現在所知道的，維他命有七種，但是就實際的功用言，只算六種。牠們都各有其特殊的功用，不能互相代替：所以我們單吃一種食物，雖然得了某一種維他命郤缺省了别種維他命，這是不適宜的。</p>
<p>從前有許多不可解的事實，現在因爲維他命的發現，都打破了神秘而得了原因。例如航海的旅行家和水手，往往發生「壞血病」，從前都不知道其病源，現在才知道是由於缺乏維他命Ｃ所致，這種維他命是包含在新鮮的水菓和蔬菜中。航海中很難得新鮮的水菓及蔬菜，所以缺乏了維他命Ｃ，就得了「壞血病」。</p>
<p>現在將牠們的功用及來源依次說明於下面：</p>
<p>維他命Ａ　他的功用：（一）防止傷風及微菌傳染。在牛奶，牛油，新鮮牛酪及蛋中含得有。（二）維持建康並促進兒童之生長。在綠色的蔬菜如菠菜及綠蘿蔔中含得有。（三）防止眼病。在黃色的蔬菜中含得有。</p>
<p>維他命Ｂ　牠的功用：（一）保持神經健康及防止神經病。在小麥及其他穀類的芽中含得有。（二）增進食慾。在動物的肝臟及萵苣中含得有。（三）助嬰兒生長。在生花生中含得有。</p>
<p>維他命Ｃ　牠的功用：保持血球的康健防止壞血病。在橘子，檸檬，葡萄，生的白菜，鹹菜，發芽豆，番茄，萵苣，花生及菠菜中含得有。</p>
<p>維他命D　牠的功用：（一）助骨的長成防止小兒軟骨病。在肝，肝油及蛋黃中含得有。（二）防牙齒壞及輔助血液凝集。在日光及太陽燈光中含得有。</p>
<p>維他命Ｅ　牠的功用：帮助母體内嬰兒的生長。在小麥及穀類的胚子油及植物油中含得有。</p>
<p>維他命Ｆ　牠的功用與維他命Ｂ同。</p>
<p>維他命Ｇ　牠的功用：防止皮膚病。在鮮牛乳，肝，綠色的蔬菜，香蕉，及發酵物中含得有。</p>
<p>我們旣知道了牠們的功用及來源，同時覺察出自己缺乏的是何種維他命，那麽每天食物的配置，就不難安排了。</p>

<p>只見一個老年的乞丐，微微的蹲着，口中說：「老爺們！太太們！賞我幾個錢買碗粥吃吃罷！我並不是懶惰而流爲乞丐，我的家……巳被砲火轟掉了……」。他呌喊的聲音一聲比一聲的悲哀，一聲比一聲的悽慘，想藉此聲浪，而得到相當的代價。他呌得聲嘶力竭力，一個錢還沒要到手。忽然一陣女學生來了，他開口說：「小姐……」。老不成的東西！嚇得我好呀！這乞丐冷笑了一聲說：「我如果是一個部長，廳長，博士，碩士你們或者不嫌我老，而在我面前唱讚美歌了。</p>
<p>我聽了回來想了一想，神聖的女學生，爲什麽只有虚榮勢力！竟爲此老乞道着了。」</p>

<p>白匋先生這篇（誰是賣國賊）文中（簽字賣國條約的賣國賊，究竟是誰呢？不是别人，正是大名鼎鼎的賣國賊曹陸章三人中的陸增祥，）</p>
<p>白匋先生誤記了，所謂大名鼎鼎的賣國賊曹陸章的陸，乃陸宗輿字閏生浙之海寗人，而非陸增祥，這是誰也知道的，講到二十一條的副署者，是否陸增祥，那我不明白，所以不敢武斷，因爲當時北政府沒有明白公佈，汪精衛誤指熊希齡爲副署者，大槪也是這個緣故吧？</p>
<p>又說（陸增祥因爲簽定賣國條約，自己懺悔不及，現在棄了家室，跑到外國去做和尙了）陸增祥到外國去做和尙的動機，據我知道是接受他的外國夫人「比國人」的遺言，恐怕並不爲了懺悔不及？他的比國夫人的遺言，從前滬上各報曾經刋載過呢，（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement and the Northeast Problem <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Han</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement has been signed yesterday.</p>
<p>This ceasefire conference experienced countless twists and turns, finally reaching a conclusion yesterday. What the agreement reveals to us is: formal ceasefire in Shanghai, determination of the Japanese military's retreat points as a guarantee for the ceasefire. As for the troop withdrawal, a timeline is still not determined. The outcome of the agreement is thus and no more. It was long expected by the people of our country that this ceasefire conference would have no good results. However, our authorities, when reporting on diplomatic policies at the National Crisis Conference, stated, "The government will endure within a certain limit; beyond that limit, it cannot endure." In that case, yesterday's signing of the agreement indicates that it is within the tolerable limit.</p>
<p>The Japan problem is not a local issue. The Shanghai problem is an extension of the Northeast problem and a part of Japan's entire problem of invading our country. If the Northeast problem is not resolved, then even if the Shanghai problem is temporarily resolved, the trouble will still be endless. Tracing back to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, informed individuals all knew that Japan wanted to use the strategy of feinting in the east while attacking in the west, hoping to shift the world's attention to Shanghai while neglecting the Northeast. Indeed. The Shanghai war in January caused the friendly countries to worry extremely about Shanghai, the hub of international trade. Thus, there was mediation, conferences, stalemates, and turns. Confused and uncertain, nothing seemed to work. And our people were also all focused on the Shanghai issue, neglecting the Northeast problem.</p>
<p>Japan created the January 28th Shanghai incident. Its original intention was indeed to shift the world's attention, but it also did not initially expect the war situation to extend to such a degree, nor did it expect the world's public opinion to become increasingly worse toward Japan. Therefore, Japan had to find a way to break through this difficult situation. Its focal point of negotiation in the League of Nations was to break the linkage between the Northeast problem and the Shanghai problem. Japan knew very well that the major powers had significant interests in the economic center of Shanghai and would definitely not stand idly by. Therefore, it managed to use its skills in the complicated and bizarre Shanghai ceasefire conference to achieve the goal of breaking the linkage.</p>
<p>The Shanghai ceasefire conference firmly grasped these two points of shifting world attention and breaking the difficult linkage. It made every effort to cope, even disregarding offending the League of Nations and angering small countries. Therefore, today's signing of the ceasefire agreement is a great success for Japan's diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, before the ceasefire agreement was signed, weren't Japan's various arrangements in the Northeast becoming increasingly fierce? Encouraging the establishment of the puppet state, the attempt to eliminate the volunteer armies, and obstructing the actions of the investigation team, etc., weren't they all implemented before the agreement was signed? After the ceasefire agreement is signed, Japan will more single-mindedly plan for the Northeast.</p>
<p>And the Northeast is becoming more and more dangerous.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we must tell our countrymen now is that although the ceasefire agreement has been signed, the Shanghai problem is still difficult to resolve. May our people not forget the future difficulties of Shanghai because of this compromised and pitiful ending. Even more, may they not forget the Northeast, which will be forever lost, because Shanghai can be temporarily secure.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ceasefire Agreement Signed Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Full Text of Agreement Released Last Night</p>
<p>Japanese Troops to Begin Withdrawal Today</p>
<p>Joint Committee Established Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement was formally signed by representatives of China, Japan, and the friendly nations at 11:35 AM yesterday, and completed at 1:33 PM. The full text of the agreement was released simultaneously in Nanjing, Tokyo, and Shanghai at 9:00 PM last night. Japanese representative Shimada announced at the meeting yesterday morning that the Japanese troops would begin withdrawing today. The Joint Committee was also established today to monitor the implementation of the agreement by both parties. The tortuous and winding ceasefire negotiations have thus been concluded.</p>
<p>Situation of the Formal Signing: The ceasefire conference, which began on February 24th, went through a total of fourteen plenary sessions, during which it almost broke down several times. At 10:30 AM yesterday, the fifteenth plenary session was held at the British Consulate General. The representatives attending were: from our side, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, representatives Zhang Sixu, military representatives Dai Ji and Huang Qiang, secretaries Yin Rugeng, Deng Zhongying, Li Tiezheng, and Zhang Yidong; from the Japanese side, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi, representatives Moriya, military representatives Tashiro and Shimada, secretaries Okazaki, Arino, Mizuno, Kita, and Abe; from the friendly nations, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilden, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano. First, British Consul-General Blackburn read the clauses of the agreement one by one. China and Japan had no objections, and the formal signing began. The first to sign was Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi. Six copies of the English version of the ceasefire agreement were taken to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road by Zhang Sixu, Okazaki, and Blackburn in the same car. They arrived at 11:35 AM and immediately entered Shigemitsu's sickroom. The agreement was handed to Shigemitsu Aoi, who signed it on his sickbed at 11:45 AM. Zhang Sixu, Okazaki, and Blackburn then took the agreement back to the British Consulate. Subsequently, Japanese Naval Chief of Staff Shimada Shigetaro and Japanese Army Chief of Staff Tashiro Kanichiro signed. Next, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilden, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano signed. Zhang Sixu, Okazaki, and Blackburn then took the agreement to Hong'en Hospital on Daxi Road, arriving at 12:40 PM. It was handed to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, who also signed it on his sickbed. At that time, Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji also left the British Consulate and went to Hong'en Hospital. Commander Dai also signed in front of Vice Minister Guo's sickbed, completing the signing at 12:50 PM. Zhang Sixu, Okazaki, and Blackburn then took the agreement back to the British Consulate and handed it to Chief of Staff Huang Qiang of the 19th Route Army, who signed it. Zhang Sixu, Okazaki, and Blackburn then took the agreement to the Japanese Army Hospital on Pingliang Road, arriving at 1:23 PM. It was handed to Ueda Kenkichi, commander of the 9th Division of the Japanese Army, who signed it at 1:33 PM. The signing of the agreement was thus completed. Yesterday, there was drizzle and a chilly spring wind. Inside the British Consulate, the patrol department increased the number of Western detectives and Japanese detectives on guard. When Director Zhang and the other two took the agreement back and forth to the various hospitals, Western detectives followed closely behind to provide special protection.</p>
<p>Proceedings of Yesterday Morning's Meeting: Earlier, the Military Subcommittee held a meeting at 9:30 AM yesterday. The representatives attending were: from our side, Chief of Staff Huang; from the Japanese side, Chief of Staff Tashiro; from the friendly nations, British Counselor Sansom, American Counselor Trythall, French Counselor Pennavaria, and Italian Counselor Farattini. The representatives affixed their seals to the six attached maps of the agreement. Then, at 10:30 AM, the plenary session was reconvened. First, British Consul-General Blackburn read the agreement. The British Minister asked both China and Japan if there were any objections after each clause was read. When reading the second and third clauses, our representative Zhang Sixu read two statements from our government to the conference (the original text is appended below). After being approved by the conference, Consul Blackburn continued to read the clauses of the agreement. After reading near number two, Japanese representative Shimada announced to the conference that the Japanese troops would begin withdrawing tomorrow to show sincerity in implementing the agreement, and so on. After the full text of the agreement was read and passed, British Minister Lampson and Okazaki of the Japanese side made a few remarks to commemorate the success of the conference. Our Director Zhang also gave a simple reply, saying, "British Minister, American Minister, French Minister, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires, the success of this ceasefire negotiation relies on your tireless efforts and sincere cooperation. Vice Minister Guo and his colleagues, Commander Dai and Chief of Staff Huang, have specially instructed me to express their gratitude. Vice Minister Guo and his colleagues are especially impressed by your firm patience and skillful means over the past few weeks. I am instructed to express our gratitude first, and our government will express its gratitude formally later." Director Zhang then turned to express his gratitude to the military attachés of the four countries of Britain, America, France, and Italy, saying, "Vice Minister Guo and his military representatives express their gratitude to you for your difficult work and your professional assistance. Your assistance is truly valuable, and you have not been stingy with it, which makes us deeply admire you." Then the formal signing began, and champagne was opened to celebrate the success of peace. The documents completed and signed yesterday were six copies of the English version of the agreement, each held by China, Japan, and the four friendly nations. China and Japan also held two copies of the Chinese and Japanese translated texts, which will be sent to the Chinese and Japanese representatives for signing today. The representatives of the friendly nations will not participate, and there will be no formal meeting.</p>
<p>Selection of Members of the Joint Committee: The Joint Committee will be established today. The members of the Joint Committee are: from the British side, Consul-General John Brenan and Counselor Sansom; from the American side, Consul-General Cunningham and Counselor Trythall; from the French side, Scher and Counselor Pennavaria; from the Italian side, First Secretary Rose of the Italian Embassy and Counselor Farattini; from the Japanese side, Consul-General Murai and military attaché Harada Kumakichi. The meeting yesterday roughly finalized the appointments. As for our representative, it is internally decided to be Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. As for the military representatives, Chief of Staff Huang has recommended Du Tingxiu and Zhang Wen to the central government. The government was asked for instructions yesterday, and one of the two will be appointed, but as of 12:00 last night, no reply had been received from the government.</p>

<h3 id="e3">United Federation of Various Organizations on Recent Diplomatic Declarations <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Opinions to be Raised After Studying the Full Text of the Agreement</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Federation of National Salvation Organizations issued an important declaration yesterday on recent diplomatic issues, stating, "This federation, adhering to the public opinion of the 91 member organizations and the people they represent, has stipulated from its inception that 'stopping internal conflicts' and 'uniting against foreign aggression' should be its guiding principles. After extensively gathering public opinion and carefully weighing the pros and cons, it has also confirmed that 'armed resistance against Japanese aggression' is the only way out for our country at present. At the same time, it has advocated that 'armed resistance against Japanese aggression' should be the national policy to be pursued by the whole country. Before and after the Battle of Shanghai, it repeatedly declared to the people at home and abroad, and also truthfully informed the government authorities of the federation's attitude, saying, 'Whoever can resist Japan with force, we will treat them as our father and teacher, and we will not hesitate to do so. Whoever betrays the country and surrenders, we will hate them and treat them as our enemy, and we will not dare to refuse.' During the ceasefire negotiations, Chief Representative Guo Taiqi understood the federation's position and was always frank and forthcoming when asked. He also sincerely declared that the current negotiations were limited to a ceasefire and troop withdrawal and would not involve any political scope. In the future, if the negotiations are successful, the content can be announced in advance. When the Japanese representative inquired about the troop stationing situation in Pudong and Nanshi, Mr. Guo's attitude was firm and his position was resolute, which made the people feel at ease. In the middle, the Executive Yuan decided to send Mr. Guo to England. The federation was afraid that the chief representative would be replaced, so it telegraphed the government to ask Mr. Guo to continue his work until the end. By the time Mr. Guo returned to his post, the federation had almost stopped paying attention to the diplomatic negotiations. However, from May 1st to today, Chinese and foreign newspapers have repeatedly carried alarming reports, saying that the Japanese representative still insisted on the opinion that no troops should be stationed in Pudong and Nanshi, and the subcommittee has also repeatedly discussed this matter, saying that either the reporters took notes, or a statement was issued, or the British minister tried his best to mediate and persuaded our side to make concessions. Our government and diplomatic representatives have not made any statements opposing these reports. Only the Japanese representative, while suffering from serious injuries, is still eagerly seeking the completion of the agreement. If he did not obtain a huge amount of benefits, he would not be so sincere. Therefore, in February of this month, the Standing Committee resolved to urgently telegraph the government to declare its opposition. At the same time, representatives Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Peide, Chen Ya'fu, and Shen Zuru were sent to the Foreign Affairs Office to truthfully state the federation's intentions, stating that the discussion of not stationing troops in Pudong and Nanshi was the most painful thing for the people. It happened that Representative Guo was out, so at 8:00 the next morning, Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Xie Chengping, and Yang Rongwei went to Mr. Guo's residence to express their attitude and hoped to discuss everything in detail with Mr. Guo. However, at this time, the people outside were full of doubts. When the federation's representatives were meeting, many people arrived at the scene one after another, and there were disagreements during the conversation, resulting in the unfortunate incident of Representative Guo being injured. This was not expected by the federation's representatives. The federation has sent a letter to Representative Guo on the same day to express its condolences and still hopes that Representative Guo will continue to work hard. However, the federation has to solemnly declare that the reason why the federation cherishes Representative Guo is that it hopes that Representative Guo can carry out the work of safeguarding territorial sovereignty with an indomitable spirit and a bright and frank attitude. If the agreement or its subsidiary documents contain any political clauses, such as the non-stationing of troops in Pudong and Nanshi as rumored outside, it would be a destruction of territorial sovereignty, a violation of the agreement's principles and the League of Nations' resolutions, and even a violation of Representative Guo's repeated declarations. The federation, based on its mission of conscience, will resolutely oppose it and will never flatter anyone. Now that the entire agreement has been signed by the representatives of both sides in their sickbeds, opinions will be presented after studying the full text, so as to consult with the people of the country. As for what the President of the Executive Yuan Wang said in his speech about hiding in the concession and directing violent acts, the federation would never dare to hear of such things. Because if the government has actions that endanger the country, then public anger will be directed at it, and with common hatred, there is a political track that can be used to hold it accountable. There is no need to hide in the concession. If the federation wants to hide in the concession, then it should hope that the concession will expand to increase the scope of hiding and also obtain an increase in land prices. It will never oppose the enemy's unreasonable demands to the death. This is the declaration, and we hope for your public judgment. Shanghai United Federation of National Salvation Organizations, May 5, 1932, of the Republic of China year 21.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Yesterday's May Fifth Commemoration <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<h3 id="e5">Sun Zhe-sheng's Response to Yu Youren's Doubts <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Far East News Agency stated that yesterday a reporter, in response to Mr. Yu Youren's publication of "Doubts Regarding a Conversation with Sun Zhe-sheng," specifically visited Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng at 10 Moliai Road. Mr. Sun graciously received the reporter. The reporter asked Mr. Sun what opinions he had regarding President Yu's doubts. Mr. Sun stated that his previous publication of the National Salvation Program of Resistance Against Japan was originally intended for open discussion among central comrades and the people. Now that Mr. Yu has published his opinions and raised questions, and because the reporter has inquired, he should communicate his views on that article. (1) Mr. Yu's biggest mistake is his inability to acknowledge the past errors of our party (the Kuomintang), believing that our party is still "a sound revolutionary party." Therefore, he claims that "the ability of the party to lead the Chinese National Revolution is based on objective facts." To discuss politics with this kind of denial of illness and refusal to seek treatment, disregarding the objective facts, will not lead to correct conclusions. (2) He has an even greater error, which is misunderstanding my meaning. He believes that my advocacy for constitutional government means the rejection of the Kuomintang. In fact, my intention is the opposite. I believe that after the implementation of constitutional government, the people, under the supreme principle of the Three People's Principles, will have the freedom to organize political groups. This way, the organization of our party can be even more sound. Because after this, the non-revolutionary comrades inside and outside the party, if dissatisfied with our party, can form other groups outside the party and no longer need to pretend, using the signboard of our party to conceal their crimes. If at that time the party is occupied by reactionary forces, then all true believers of the Three People's Principles can also break away from the original party organization and form a new revolutionary group. (3) He is deeply afraid that after the ban on parties is lifted, the party's organization will not be able to exist. If this becomes a future reality, then what value does our party have in existing? (4) He believes that after the party ban is lifted, reactionary forces can use this opportunity to expand. I believe that the rise and fall of reactionary forces entirely depends on the rise and fall of the revolutionary forces of our party. Is it not the case that reactionary forces are increasing day by day now that the party ban has not been lifted? (5) He compares the future constitutional government to the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China in the early years and Cao Kun's constitution, which makes me very sad. Does he believe that there are still Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun figures within the party today? Otherwise, if there is no one to destroy the law, there will be no acts of destroying the law. If today's rulers are still like those of twelve years ago, then what can we say? But where are today's Yuan Cao and Xu Shichang? (6) He dwells on the issue of political tutelage, but according to the Outline of National Reconstruction, the period of political tutelage is six years. Our party has established its capital in Nanjing for five years, and next April will mark the full six years. If it is believed that the achievements of these six years of political tutelage are not good and need to be extended, then extending political tutelage in name is merely extending the period of dictatorship. (7) He believes that the democratic politics of the bourgeoisie are used to deceive the masses. That is correct, but what is it then to use the name of political tutelage to stifle all freedoms of the people and prevent the people from having the opportunity to exercise political power? (8) He claims to adhere to the doctrine without deviation, believing that he is both loyal and trustworthy. In fact, the Prime Minister's doctrine lies in practice, practicing it to save the country and the people. If someone wants to distort the truth and make wrong right, then it is definitely not the true meaning of loyalty and trustworthiness. (9) He believes that the rule of law is the demand of the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party, and that advocating for constitutional government represents the demands of these two groups. I ask, under violent politics, do the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party not operate? Only their methods are different. (10) He says, "Even with the party governing the party and the country with the form of democratic centralism, there is still concern about disorganization. Why seek the false name of general democracy and suffer the real disaster of disorganization?" According to this, neither the party's democratic centralism nor the country's democratic politics should be implemented. Is it better to return to an autocratic dictatorship? (11) He says that the constitutional government sought by our party is revolutionary constitutional government. Indeed, revolutionary constitutional government is what we seek day and night. But when will revolutionary constitutional government come? After the establishment of revolutionary regimes, Germany, Russia, and Turkey all had the promulgation and implementation of constitutions. Will China's constitution have to wait until all 400 million people have graduated from school before it is promulgated? (12) He believes that implementing constitutional government endangers the foundation of the country. I do not know on what basis this is said. (13) On one hand, he denies the power of the masses, unwilling for the people to have the right to participate in politics, and at the same time, he wants the people to rise up and supervise the government. Isn't this extremely contradictory? It should be known that if the people do not have legal protection for the freedom of political organization, how can they supervise the government? Taking the recent anti-Japanese resistance in Shanghai as an example, the expression of the people's power can be said to be extremely great. It is a pity that the government does not accept the people's supervision. (14) Finally, regarding the point of destroying the party and destroying the doctrine, I always believe that those who are blinded by personal views, disregard the facts, and carry out counter-revolution in the name of revolution are the ones who destroy the party and destroy the doctrine. If revolutionaries can frankly acknowledge past mistakes and at the same time be courageous and resolute in correcting them, this is what revolutionary, party-saving, and doctrine-loyal people should do. My opinions on Mr. Yu's remarks are roughly as described above. I hope that Mr. Yu's statements are not made without reason, and at the same time, I hope that Mr. Yu stands on the position of revolution and the party, represents the interests of the people, and fulfills a little of his supervisory responsibility. If one departs from the interests of the people, then what revolution can be spoken of? Speaking of my advocacy for constitutional government, I have a few additional remarks. Generally, people believe that hoping for the current government to implement constitutional government is like seeking skin from a tiger. But I believe that at this time, the comrades of our party should quickly promote constitutional government, allowing the people to participate in politics, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past twenty years, being trapped in armed struggle for a long time, making it impossible for politics to get on the right track and for the country to have a day of construction. I sincerely hope that experienced and nationalistic people like Mr. Yu Youren can put aside emotions and sentiments and consider this carefully. As he finished speaking, another guest requested an audience, and the reporter then took his leave.</p>
<h3 id="e6">City Council Representatives Visit Fei Xindun Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Result of the Conversation Was Good</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the City Council dispatched representatives Zhang Yichen, Jiang Junyi, and Zhou Fuzhang to visit Fei Xindun, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, to question: (1) Regarding the exemption of the police tax in the Hongkou area, after several negotiations, now that there is an exemption method, the tax should be collected after the announcement. Currently, those collecting taxes in the Hongkou area are still urging payment urgently. This should be stopped. (2) After the bomb incident in Hongkou Park, the Japanese searched the Chinese very strictly, and there was also the illegal arrest of 25 workers from the Nanyang Printing Company, causing great panic among the Chinese in Hongkou. Since the Hongkou area is under the jurisdiction of your bureau, your bureau should quickly find a way to stop such illegal actions. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the Chinese in Hongkou to live in peace, and how can your bureau collect taxes? (3) Recently, the Japanese rushed through the Sanbanchang New Bridge and stabbed seven Chinese people. Your bureau should lodge a serious protest. Director-General Fei replied: (1) The police tax in the Hongkou area will be collected after the exemption method is announced. (2) After an investigation is completed, a protest will be lodged with the Japanese consul. (3) It is heard that it started with Chinese children throwing stones at the Japanese, but this cannot be taken as the basis. After an investigation is completed, the case will be combined and a protest will be lodged with the Japanese consul. Afterwards, the representatives solemnly discussed the future security issues with Director-General Fei to ensure the safety of the concession. Director-General Fei also earnestly expressed his personal opinions. After discussing for a while, they agreed. The representatives then took their leave at a little after 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Chongguang Has His Right Foot Amputated <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Surgery Was Performed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Famous Doctors Guarded Him All Night Last Night</p>
<p>Ambassador Chongguang, who is recuperating in Fumin Hospital, has had the fractured part of his right tibia increasingly deteriorate in recent days. After a detailed examination by various doctors, it was found that the fragments were embedded in the fractured bone, so it was believed that there was no way to clamp them out and that the right leg had to be amputated to be saved. However, it was delayed because it was feared that high fever would develop after major surgery, which would affect the signing of the ceasefire agreement. Yesterday afternoon, after the signing procedures on the hospital bed were completed, a major surgery was performed in the special ward of Fumin Hospital at 2:20 PM. Dr. Goto, a surgeon general and medical doctor dispatched by the Japanese government, performed the surgery, with Dr. Hattori and Second-Class Military Surgeon Watanabe assisting. Dr. Dongong and Dr. Matsui of Fumin Hospital, Second-Class Military Surgeon Zheng of Isonaga, Navy Surgeon Major Kawada, Hospital Director Kamei of the Akita Garrison, and Dr. Akita assisted from the side. The waist marrow anesthesia method was used first, and then Ambassador Chongguang's right thigh was amputated from the central part downwards. The surgery lasted for over an hour and ended at 3:15 PM. The process was still good. Last night, the famous doctors guarded him all night, and his body temperature was extremely high. The signing of the Chinese and Japanese versions of the ceasefire agreement today may be postponed because of this. As for Shirakawa and Ueda, there were no changes and the wound treatment was progressing well.</p>

<p>Explanation of the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Japan Neither Obeys the League of Nations Resolution</p>
<p>And Prevents China From Fulfilling Its Obligations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chief Chinese Representative, Dr. Yan, will submit a memorandum criticizing the preliminary report of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry to the Secretariat of the League of Nations within one or two days. Dr. Yan spoke to a Reuters interviewer today, briefly stating the contents of his memorandum, saying that the preliminary report of the Commission of Inquiry shows that Japan has not only failed to fulfill the resolution passed by the Executive Yuan on December 10, stipulating that the Japanese army withdraw into the South Manchurian Railway area, but also prevented China from fulfilling its obligations under this resolution. The so-called Chinese obligation is that China is responsible for the safety of life and property of Japanese residents outside the railway area when the Japanese army withdraws. Dr. Yan continued to speak about the activities of the Japanese army, saying that the Japanese have always declared that their military operations in the three northeastern provinces are to suppress bandits, but the Lytton Report shows that Japanese military operations are now being carried out against organized Chinese troops resisting the Manchukuo army. Dr. Yan attaches great importance to this situation and fears that disputes will arise, but said that he will still deal with it with patience, hoping to obtain a final satisfactory solution.

<p>Litvinov Replied With a Letter of Rejection</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, local newspapers published the full text of a letter from League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, requesting that Soviet officials in Manchuria provide the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry with testimony regarding the local situation, and Litvinov's letter expressing the Soviet government's rejection of this request. In his letter to Litvinov, Drummond relayed the intention of Lord Lytton, saying that if Soviet officials in Manchuria could provide current witness reports regarding the local situation, it would greatly facilitate the work of the Commission of Inquiry, so he specifically sought the Soviet government's opinion on whether it would object to its officials providing such witness reports. In his reply to Drummond, Litvinov said that the Soviet government is willing to do its best to assist any commission of inquiry with the sincerity to reveal the true situation in Manchuria and stop the Chinese affairs. However, the Soviet government is not a member of the League of Nations and did not participate in the League of Nations' discussion of the Chinese incident or the composition of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry. The Commission of Inquiry also does not have a Soviet representative. Therefore, the Soviet government finds it difficult to determine an appropriate attitude towards the reports provided by its officials, and it is even more difficult to bear any responsibility for the conclusions drawn from such reports by the Commission of Inquiry. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government has no choice but to reject the request of the Commission of Inquiry. (Sizhe News Agency telegram, 4th)</p>

<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State Reaffirms Far East Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Land Acquired in Violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact Will Not Be Recognized</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - Acting Secretary of State Castle delivered an important speech here last night, announcing foreign policy, especially regarding the Far East. Castle did not favor any retaliatory actions against any countries and strongly criticized the concept of power on which the League of Nations was built. Castle introduced a new term in international law called the "Hoover Doctrine," which states that land acquired in violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact will not be recognized.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 4th - Today, U.S. Undersecretary of State Castle stated in a speech at the American International Justice Society that when the United States declared that it could not recognize situations created by methods that violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it had inserted the edge of the Kellogg-Briand Pact into the Manchurian crisis. This "Hoover Doctrine" is a contribution by the United States to limiting the ability of countries to use force as an instrument. The United States rejected the proposal of economic retaliation because it would only unfairly treat others and harm civilized nations, ultimately leading to war. On the contrary, the "Hoover Doctrine" allows the United States to remain unentangled while at the same time demonstrating its willingness to cooperate with other countries. He pointed out that the League of Nations' recent endorsement of this doctrine is proof of its value and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Indirectly Warns Japan</p>
<p>The Authority of Treaties is Almost Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Only by Strengthening Naval Defenses</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - During a meeting of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee today, Senator Hale began a campaign to pass a bill to build ships to the treaty limit, saying that the United States should have a navy capable of avoiding war. The passage of this bill would strengthen the hand of the U.S. representative in Geneva. Hale went on to describe the tragic situation in the Far East, saying that the treaty in which we have absolute faith has now completely failed in its current effect. Its authority has been lost, and we can no longer rely on it for future security. The U.S. Navy today is much weaker than before the Washington Conference. Hale warned Japan that the U.S.'s failure to strengthen its Pacific naval defenses is based on treaties guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and the open door policy.</p>

<p>Japan Endangers Peace with Undeclared War</p>
<p>Italy's Interests in China Suffer Great Losses</p>
<p>Once China's Politics and Economy Recover</p>
<p>It Will Have Great Power in the World</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 4th - Italian Prime Minister Grandi said in the House of Representatives today that while disarmament was being discussed in Geneva, the sound of cannons in the Far East was deafening. The world now has no so-called remoteness. Countries like Italy, which have global relations, no longer have a distinction between near and far. From the perspective of establishing a field and from the special standpoint of Italian interests, both China and Japan are related to Italy. The undeclared war in the Far East has lasted for eight months. The Italian government, together with the powers concerned in the Pacific, has adopted an impartial attitude in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict and to obtain a rapid and fair resolution that conforms to the principles of the Paris Pact, the League of Nations Charter, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Grandi then detailed Italy's special relationship with China, saying that Italy has 500 missionaries in China, divided into 29 missionary regions, as well as the Tianjin Concession, Italian banks, consular jurisdiction, Boxer indemnity, and former Austrian debts. In Shanghai, there is also the Italian Chamber of Commerce, and Italian shipping on the Yangtze River has a tendency to develop commercially. Italy and Shanghai also have maritime shipping connections. Grandi went on to say that in this conflict, the interests equal to Italy's special interests are the political interests concentrated on the balance of power in the Pacific and the status stipulated in the treaty. This conflict is now happening in a country with a huge population. Although this country is now in turmoil, with its 400 million people, once its politics and economy recover, it will inevitably have great power in world relations. However, at a time when international unity is urgently needed to overcome the economic crisis, this conflict endangers world peace. The diplomatic negotiations in Shanghai seem to be approaching the end stage at this time, but the situation is still in danger of renewed disputes, because the unified cooperation that is indispensable for adjusting various international relations in the Far East does not yet seem to be fully mature. Nevertheless, this reason must not make us abandon the hope that the Far East conflict can be resolved amicably and satisfactorily through the good cooperation of the relevant powers in maintaining peace in the Far East. Grandi also spoke of the disarmament conference, saying that there was too much discussion and too many proposals in Geneva, but the results were minimal. He doubted whether the hearts of the people of the world could wait long without demanding a clarification of the fundamental positions of the countries.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Major Disarmament Debate <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Advocate Abolishing Submarines</p>
<p>Japanese Representatives Strenuously Argue Against Abolition</p>
<p>France Takes a Stubborn Stance</p>
<p>The Conference Makes No Progress</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 4th - In today's Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference, the American and Japanese representatives once again held different views. American representative Stebbins argued that aircraft carriers are defensive weapons rather than offensive weapons. Japanese representative Sato said that aircraft carriers and all warships equipped with aircraft landing decks are the most advantageous weapons of aggression in modern warfare. After abolishing them, the naval strength stipulated in the Washington and London conventions will not be significantly affected. He also said that aircraft carriers are not needed unless a fleet is taking aggressive action. He greatly agreed with Stebbins' claim that aircraft carriers are the most effective weapons against submarines, but believed that this alone proves that they are offensive weapons because submarines are defensive weapons. He also said that Japan does not oppose allowing warships to carry several aircraft for reconnaissance purposes, but if a fleet has aircraft carriers and bombers, it will be easier to commit acts of aggression in distant seas and increase the fleet's offensive power. British representative Monsell said that the offensive capabilities of aircraft carriers are somewhat exaggerated. This type of warship has thin armor and is a larger target for enemy attacks, so it is the most vulnerable among all types of warships. However, he also agreed to limit the number and size of aircraft carried by aircraft carriers. He also said that a fleet near enemy territory is not necessarily an act of aggression, especially when the country has remote overseas territories. Later, French representative Dumont gave a lengthy and thoughtful speech, saying that submarines are only sufficient to threaten battleships. France must have submarines as a supplement because it has too few battleships. German representative Rheinbaben argued that the interpretation of submarines as offensive weapons in the Treaty of Versailles should be accepted. It is now expected that submarines will become the target of the next heated debate.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 5th - After struggling to discuss the British proposal to abolish submarines as offensive weapons, the Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference today failed to reach any resolution. Therefore, the issue of naval mines was discussed. The British representative said that Britain advocates that if submarines are abolished, then "contact mines" in the sea should also be abolished. The Italian representative said that if submarines are abolished, then battleships should also be abolished. The Polish representative said that submarines are only defensive weapons to resist superior navies. However, Poland is prepared to follow the major countries that signed the London Naval Treaty in this matter. American representative Stebbins strongly argued against submarines and said that if submarines are not completely abolished, the United States intends to establish a strong submarine base in the Philippines.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 5th - At 10 a.m. this morning, the Naval Committee of the Disarmament Conference convened. The Japanese representative attacked the British and American propositions, arguing that submarines are defensive weapons rather than offensive weapons and should not be included in the list of abolitions. Once they are abolished, countries with strong navies can roam the seas without interference, and countries with weak navies will have no way to guarantee their national defense security. This will lead to stronger countries becoming stronger and weaker countries becoming weaker. Japan also opposed the British proposal to limit the tonnage of submarines because countries with longer coastlines need larger submarines. Therefore, Japan argues that submarines not exceeding 2,000 tons should be classified as defensive weapons, and the strength of submarines should not be strictly limited unless it is considered in relation to the strength of other warships.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 5th - This morning, the Geneva Daily commented on the discussions of the technical committee in recent days, believing that the Disarmament Conference may soon drift into a completely deadlocked situation. The newspaper, which often reflects France's attitude towards international issues, claimed that the Disarmament Conference is making backward progress, and this deeply regrettable development is not unrelated to France's stubborn attitude. It also said that after adopting a resolution with completely unambiguous terms, advocating the abolition of offensive weapons, the Disarmament Conference entrusted the experts with the arduous task of defining offensive weapons. However, the experts in Paris in 1919 only needed 48 hours to define the types of offensive weapons that Germany was not allowed to possess. The experts in Geneva in 1931 seem to be inheriting the legacy of their predecessors, reaching a conclusion that there are no offensive weapons in the world.</p>

<p>Four Defendants Each Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison</p>
<p>But Released After One Hour of Imprisonment</p>
<p>National News Agency, Honolulu, 4th - The so-called "honor killing" case in Honolulu suddenly ended today. First Lieutenant McHugh of the U.S. Navy, his mother-in-law, and two sailors were initially declared guilty of manslaughter by a jury last Friday. Today, the judge sentenced each to ten years in prison. Then, Honolulu Governor Judd issued an order to commute the sentence, reducing the ten-year imprisonment to one hour, to be served at the Iolani Palace, the location of the Honolulu legislature. Upon completion of the one-hour period, they were immediately released. The case was originally scheduled to be sentenced on Friday, so no one knew of today's sudden ending. When the news of the verdict spread, the palace was crowded with spectators. The palace was the former palace of the Hawaiian king before the United States annexed the island. The case had attracted great attention from Americans due to racial views and other reasons. Although the jury reduced the murder charge to manslaughter, Americans were still extremely indignant. There were threats to boycott the jury and proposals to ask Congress to pardon the four defendants. American customs have always had a kind of unwritten law, still passed down from colonial times, that people of color who rape white women can be executed by private justice. Therefore, although the murdered Hawaiian, Kahahawai, was only a suspect with insufficient evidence, and was shot and killed by Lieutenant McHugh, the Americans, bound by custom, naturally had different views. Therefore, there was this special sympathy for McHugh's conviction. The authorities in Hawaii, to prevent the occurrence of extrajudicial action, advanced the sentence today. In the morning, the defense lawyer, prosecutor, and judge consulted, and then the four defendants were brought to court, the verdict was announced, and the governor's commutation order was immediately announced.</p>

<p>Raising Questions During Meetings with Japanese Officials</p>
<p>Avoiding Surveillance, Meetings Held at Own National Consulates</p>
<p>Glimpses of Representative Koo's Talks with Japanese Reporters</p>
<p>Shenyang Special Correspondent: After arriving in Shenyang and resting for a day, the League of Nations Investigation Team officially visited Japanese Acting Consul-General in Shenyang, Mr. Morishima Mamoru, on the 23rd. They inquired about the events surrounding the September 18th Incident, Sino-Japanese relations, and the issue of parallel railway lines. Morishima spoke volubly, denouncing the former Northeast officials as muddleheaded and lawless. On the 24th, the team officially visited Commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo Shigeru, who hosted a banquet. Subsequently, both sides held talks for two to three hours daily, also for the purpose of studying the September 18th Incident. Sir Lytton, Brigadier-General Claudel, and Major-General McCoy raised various questions, such as: why such a large-scale war was necessary for such a minor railway issue; also, what was heard in Peiping from the former Northeast leader Zhang Xueliang was obviously different from what the Japanese side stated. The Japanese side strongly defended themselves and presented so-called "evidence."</p>
<p>The investigation team's stay here seems to have three reasons: (1) The League of Nations Council will hold a meeting on May 1st, and a first report must be completed before then; (2) The battles regarding Changchun, Jilin, Qiqihar, and Jinzhou still need to be discussed with the Commander of the Kwantung Army; (3) Transportation north of Harbin is very difficult, and for safety reasons, the itinerary is still under study.</p>
<p>For convenience and freedom, each commissioner meets, convenes meetings, and writes reports at their own national consulate. At the British consulate, so-called "farmer representatives," "Korean people representatives," and representatives from Japanese and Manchukuo newspapers visit daily. The team sends personnel to receive them and accept their statements.</p>
<p>Personnel from the Chinese delegation reside in the Yamato and Oriental Hotels, and detectives accompany them in and out, ostensibly for protection. Representative Koo is in contact with the investigation team daily and communicates with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His work is very busy, and he only takes walks in Chiyoda Park and Kasuga Town in the evening. On the night of the 23rd, consuls from various countries stationed in Shenyang held a grand social gathering at the Yamato Hotel to welcome the investigation team. Although Representative Koo was on the guest list, he has never danced during this time of national crisis. Other members of the delegation gather in room 221 of the Yamato Hotel every day to discuss and report on their observations.</p>
<p>The investigation team's report may be sent to Geneva today or tomorrow. The date of departure north is scheduled for Monday (May 2nd). The itinerary plans to stay in Changchun for one day, return to Jilin on the same day, stay in Harbin for seven days, and Qiqihar for two days. The rest will be decided on an ad hoc basis. Representative Koo insists that Heihe (Blagoveshchensk) must be visited. Except for Harbin, there are no large hotels, and transportation is inconvenient. It is also necessary to travel by plane. Therefore, the number of accompanying personnel must be greatly reduced. On the Chinese side, there will be about six or seven people at most. Mr. Zhang Weibin, who is familiar with the situation in Jilin Province, will return after accompanying them to Changchun. Mr. Yang Chengji, who is familiar with the situation in Heilongjiang Province, will return after accompanying them to Harbin. Further reductions may follow. Except for one or two people left in Shenyang to take care of luggage, all other personnel will return to Peiping via Dalian at the same time. Among the journalists accompanying the team, there were originally three. Now, by drawing lots, only Mr. Bao Jingan will go as the representative.</p>
<p>The investigation team will return to Shenyang in three weeks, stay for three days, go to Dalian, stay for another three days, and return to Peiping. They will spend two months organizing the materials gathered and considering them, and then travel east to contact the Japanese government and then return to China to contact the Chinese government before beginning to write the report.</p>
<p>Representative Koo has come here with a spirit of great fearlessness. Therefore, every word and deed has become material for newspapers. At 4:30 p.m. on April 22nd, he officially met with Japanese journalists at the Yamato Hotel in Shenyang at their request. The questions and answers were quite interesting and are recorded here for amusement.</p>
<p>(Question) Has the itinerary been decided? (Answer) As far as I know, it has not yet been decided. (Question) Will you act in concert with the other commissioners? (Answer) The task of the participating members is to assist the investigation team to fully accomplish its mission. I and the Japanese participating member have the same status and will naturally take concerted action with the other commissioners. (Question) What is your opinion regarding Manchukuo's rejection of you? (Answer) This investigation is based on the League of Nations resolution of December 10th last year. This resolution was recognized by both China and Japan. As a participating member of the investigation team, I cannot but participate in the investigation. (Question) Hasn't Manchukuo declared that it will arrest you? (Answer) Whether an investigation is possible is a matter for the investigation team. I do not need to answer. However, the investigation team has come for peace in East Asia and aims to ascertain the truth of the matter. Manchukuo's rejection of me is truly incomprehensible. (Question) What is your opinion regarding Russia's request to replace its consul in Heihe? (Answer) I only learned about this from the newspaper today. I cannot answer whether the government has received notification. (Question) What is the National Government's observation of Manchukuo? (Answer) I have been away from Nanjing for a long time because I am participating in the investigation team and cannot answer. (Question) But what is your personal opinion? (Answer) This matter is very important and I cannot answer casually. (Question) The National Government has posted slogans such as Japan's annexation of Manchuria. What is your opinion on this? (Answer) I don't remember. (Question) What is your personal opinion regarding Sino-Japanese relations? (Answer) Sino-Japanese relations in recent months have not been a pleasant phenomenon. China and Japan are natural neighbors, interdependent like lips and teeth. I have long heard of the idea of co-existence and co-prosperity. However, the current situation has reached such a state that unless there is eternal hostility, there will be no day for reconciliation. If we are willing to co-exist and co-prosper, we must find another path. The disputes that have arisen today are not entirely due to China. I dare to say that the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations cannot be said to be Japan's fault and China's right, nor can it be said to be China's fault and Japan's right. The process of mutual accusations cannot be determined now. However, misunderstandings between the two countries must be one of the reasons. To resolve these misunderstandings, we need far-sightedness and effort. However, judging from the current situation, not only is it impossible to resolve misunderstandings, but there is a trend to make them increasingly serious. Therefore, I cannot help but feel very sorry for the occurrence of this fact. (Question) Chinese education pays attention to anti-foreignism, especially anti-Japanese. What is your opinion? (Answer) Matters that easily cause misunderstandings are also easy to find solutions to. (April 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Director of the American Far Eastern Bureau Discusses the Spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>If One Country Infringes Upon the Common Interests of All Countries</p>
<p>The United States Should Adopt a Coordinated Policy with All Countries</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported that Stanley Hornbeck, Director of the American Far Eastern Bureau, expressed his views on the Far East issue at a meeting of the International Law Association on the 29th of last month, clarifying the position of the United States. He said that the United States has always respected the principles of other countries' legitimate and vested rights, and, based on the most-favored-nation clause, promotes equality of commercial opportunity, avoids alliances and aggression, and opposes any country obtaining improper rights through coercion. The United States has adopted these points as its foreign policy. Although the United States has not formally joined the League of Nations, it has always cooperated with the League to maintain this purpose. Originally, the US policy towards China was based on the Nine-Power Treaty. The US government's emphasis on the Nine-Power Treaty originally hoped that the signatory countries would respect the spirit of the treaty and be bound by the treaty. All countries that signed the treaty should enjoy its actual rights and interests. Therefore, the United States bases its historical policy towards China on the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. At the same time, all countries with rights and interests in the Far East have been consistent in principle since the beginning of the 20th century, that is, the signatory countries should guarantee the overall and ultimate interests of all in the treaty, so that a balance of power can be established in the Far East. If two of the signatory countries have a dispute, the United States should adopt reasonable and fair means to try its best to maintain this treaty, and resolve the dispute under coordination with the countries concerned. The United States and Japan are the two major powers in the Pacific, and the relationship is very important. Recalling that the participating countries in the Washington Conference were all countries with vested interests in China, therefore, the political and economic development in the Far East must respect the fundamental rights and interests of the countries concerned. No country can enjoy rights alone, nor can it bear obligations alone. In this way, world peace can be maintained. If one country infringes upon the common interests of all countries, a peaceful situation cannot be maintained. All countries must never allow the common interests of the world to be trampled upon by one country. In short, in order to maintain peace and uphold the treaty, the United States government should adopt a coordinated policy with all countries. Former Secretary of State Stimson's official statement to Senator Borah in a letter was based on this principle, so as to avoid conflicts between China and Japan, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Hebei Province Implements Official Opium Sales <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Monthly Income Approximately One Million Yuan</p>
<p>And Will Encourage Farmers to Grow Opium</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent: Official opium sales in the North have been openly implemented. According to investigations, the organizers are the Revenue Raising Committee. The members of this committee are all valiant and martial current military leaders. The reason is that the 200,000-plus troops stationed in Hebei and Chahar provinces have been in arrears for several months. The troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces were originally subsidized by Zhang Xueliang. Since the September 18th Incident, subsidies have been stopped. The difficult situation in Shanxi and Suiyuan is equal to that of Hebei and Chahar. Although the provincial and municipal governments have reduced staff and salaries, subsidies to the military are actually limited. The Financial Reorganization Committee is also at a loss. The Revenue Raising Committee has no alchemic touch to turn base metal into gold. They will naturally choose any means as long as they can raise funds. Official opium sales are the only way to generate revenue. Zhang Xueliang gave his permission and cautioned them to handle it secretly. The general headquarters for official sales in Hebei Province is the Northern Company, organized by powerful figures. It was initially located in Tianjin Special District Three. Because the opium soil passed through the Italian Concession, 60,000 taels were seized. After repeated negotiations, it has not been returned. After this blow, the company moved to Special District Two. Large quantities of opium soil arrived in Tianjin and were unloaded at the new railway station. Originally, they intended to sell openly, but fearing public disapproval, they are currently selling semi-openly, issuing destruction permits, and temporarily not implementing license fees and lamp taxes for establishing opium addiction treatment centers. People who traffic in opium must go to the company to purchase destruction permits to pass unhindered. Policemen and soldiers not only do not stop them, but also provide protection. The destruction permit is shaped like a commemorative stamp, costing two yuan each. Each bag of opium soil (weighing 20 taels) is affixed with one stamp, which allows passage within the region. If transporting from this region to another, the cost doubles. For example, from Rehe to Tianjin, each bag must be affixed with four yuan worth of destruction permits (the same from Tianjin to Peiping or from Peiping to Tianjin). If transporting from Suiyuan through Zhangjiakou and Peiping to Tianjin, each bag must be affixed with eight yuan worth of destruction permits. If the number of destruction permits affixed is insufficient during inspection by police and soldiers along the way, the penalty is doubled. In recent days, many people who trafficked in opium have been detained and fined because they were not familiar with the regulations. After the implementation of this official sale, Rehe opium soil has sold well in the Peiping and Tianjin areas. Suiyuan opium soil is selling slowly due to heavy taxes. According to insiders, Hebei Province's monthly opium revenue is about one million yuan, while monthly expenses are 600,000 yuan. In reality, only 400,000 yuan can subsidize the military. The Revenue Raising Committee, in order to plan for the long term, fears that after official sales, the number of addicts will increase, and the source will be limited, so supply will not meet demand in the long run. Therefore, they plan to order each county magistrate to encourage farmers to grow opium, which will not only avoid a lack of sources, but also allow them to collect opium seedling taxes, increasing revenue. Such poisoning of the people is hateful. Fortunately, it is now the end of spring, and it is no longer the time to grow opium, so it will have to be implemented in the autumn. (May 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e72">He Yingqin Issues Speech on Bandit Suppression in Three Provinces <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Drawing Up a New Detailed Plan for Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Total of More Than 200,000 Troops in Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent: Minister of Military Affairs and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces, He Yingqin, recently issued a statement on the suppression of the Red bandits, stating, "I was ordered last year to come to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits and have been stationed in Jiangxi for nearly a year. I had intended to clear out the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province as soon as possible under a certain plan to relieve the people from their suffering. However, due to the impact of the situation and diplomacy, the bandit suppression plan and the bandit suppression troops could not be used freely. Although the main force of the Red bandits has suffered great injuries, the remnants have fled into the mountains, gathering and dispersing unpredictably, and have not been completely eliminated as a whole. Like a prairie fire, it is still a major problem on the borders of the three provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. Speaking of this, it is extremely painful. Those in southern Jiangxi, such as the remnants of Peng Dehuai and Li Mingrui, previously gathered crowds to besiege Ganzhou, and their momentum was very fierce. Relying on the efforts of the officers and soldiers of my 18th Army and Ma Brigade to advance in suppression, they were finally completely defeated. The strength of the Red bandits has been greatly damaged. Those who are still rampant are the Mao Zedong and Lin Biao factions occupying Zhangzhou. The Red bandits have been entrenched in Jiangxi for several years, burning, killing, looting, and turning the land into a scorched earth. Recently, they have realized that they cannot receive supplies of weapons, ammunition, and food, so they have to seek other paths, and thus have the intention of fleeing into Fujian Province. However, since Guangdong Province has increased troops and divided them into Fujian and Jiangxi, joining the original military strength of Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, the total number is more than 200,000. As long as they are under a unified command under the overall plan, and given a reasonable period of time, it is not difficult to completely eliminate the Red bandits. I have come to Jiangxi Province again to understand the latest situation of the Red bandits and to inspect the deployment of our troops for suppression, so as to draw up a new detailed plan for advancing in suppression. Then, according to the plan, we will do it step by step in a practical way, with the overall goal of eliminating the Red bandits. However, we must know that the organized bandits must be completely defeated by the strength of the army. How can we completely eliminate the scattered bandits lurking in various places? With regard to clearing the household registration, handling the baojia system, receiving refugees, prospering the countryside, and propagating the Three People's Principles, the power of party affairs and politics must be used. If the power of the party and the government cannot cooperate, then when the army arrives, the bandits will divide into smaller units, avoid the real and attack the virtual, and scatter and gather indefinitely. If this continues, the power of the Red bandits will only increase day by day. Also, transportation is extremely important for bandit suppression. When I was in Nanjing, I had already made suggestions to the central government and discussed with the chairman to complete the construction of Jiangxi Province's highways as soon as possible, and to lay light railways in 100 important areas. With convenient transportation, the troops can be mobilized quickly, and the supply of supplies will be easy. The Red bandits will naturally have nowhere to escape, and it will be easy to gather and annihilate them. The personnel who came with me this time are extremely simple. Because I have important responsibilities in the Ministry of Military Affairs, I will not be stationed permanently in Nanchang in the future. I must return to Nanjing every two months to handle important ministry affairs. As for the new appointments announced by the central government of me and Chen Bonan as commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, this is only for the convenience of command and is a temporary operational command nature, which is different from a fixed position. I have not yet considered whether to formally take office, because the Minister of Military Affairs has the power to order the national army." (May 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Zhang Xianglin Passes Through Jinan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Team Will Prepare Report in Qingdao</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondent: Zhang Xianglin, Director of General Affairs and concurrently Director of Propaganda of the Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations Investigation Team, previously went to Peiping with the investigation team from Shanghai. Due to a sudden attack of lower back pain, he could no longer go to the Northeast and temporarily stayed in Peiping. The delegation appointed Zhang as the Director of the Shanghai Office. Zhang passed through Jinan from Peiping early this morning (1st). According to Zhang's conversation at the station, after the investigation team arrived in Dalian, they were monitored everywhere and their actions were no longer free. This was especially true for our delegation. Except for places permitted by the Japanese, there was danger if they went beyond the permitted boundaries. Although our delegation could communicate with Peiping by telegram, under strict surveillance, they could not speak freely. In the international community, diplomats have always been relatively free. Today, in the Northeast, a bad precedent has been set in diplomatic history. Representative Koo has come here with great determination, ignoring any intimidation, and various circles in Nanjing and Shanghai have repeatedly sent telegrams supporting him and urging him to work hard to complete his mission, so he went there resolutely. However, after arriving in the Northeast, his actions were completely restricted, making the investigation work extremely difficult. For example, the Beidaying, the site where the Northeast Incident originated, is an extremely important place, but the investigation team was prevented from going there to inspect it. Representative Koo decided to go to Changchun, but his actions were still monitored. Since his actions were not free, even if he went, he was afraid that it would be difficult to achieve any results. As for the location where the investigation team will prepare the report, it was originally planned to be in Beidaihe, but the Japanese strongly opposed it, which has become a thing of the past. It will probably be in Qingdao. Therefore, the investigation team is scheduled to go to Qingdao for summer retreat after the Northeast affairs are completed to prepare the report. The Director of our country's delegation's office in Peiping is Wang Guangqi, and I am the Director of the Shanghai office. This time I came to Shanghai to handle unfinished matters in Shanghai. Our delegation feared that they would not be free after arriving in the Northeast and that important documents might be lost, so they were not brought along. (1st)</p>

<h3 id="e75">Cai Tingkai's Address to Officers and Soldiers <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>On the 28th of last month, Commander Cai Tingkai addressed the officers and soldiers of the 60th Division at Fengqiao, Suzhou, saying: "Officers and soldiers, today your division commander asked me to speak with you. Many of you are new recruits, but the discipline and appearance on the training ground are neat and solemn, which the commander finds very satisfactory. You new recruits are now armed comrades of the 19th Route Army. Before joining, why did you want to join this group? And after joining, how should you become an outstanding member of the 19th Route Army? You must deeply understand this. Perhaps some of you eagerly joined our army due to a temporary patriotic impulse, initially not understanding the meaning of being a soldier. What is the meaning of being a soldier? First, you must have a clear purpose, dedicating yourself to the country and disregarding personal interests. Second, you must be prepared, with military knowledge and skills. With military preparation, you can use all your knowledge and skills to achieve the purpose of being a soldier, protecting the country and its people. Only then does being a soldier have meaning, only then can you be a loyal comrade of the 19th Route Army, and only then are you worthy of being called a revolutionary soldier.</p>
<p>Excluding Guangdong, Guangxi, the Northeast, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, our country currently has 90 divisions of the army. Such an astonishing number of standing soldiers is unprecedented in any modern country. Judging by the quantity of our army, China's national defense should be very solid. However, the reality is not so. The three northeastern provinces have been taken by Japan without much effort. Then Japan invaded Shanghai. After the January 28th Incident occurred, only our 19th Route Army and the 5th Army resisted them. Originally, China had over a hundred divisions (including those in Guangdong, Guangxi, etc.) of standing troops. Why were only two units fighting the Japanese army? The reasons are long and complex. In summary, after the corrupt roots were planted during the late Qing dynasty, there was no provision for national defense, the army lacked strict organization and training, transportation was inconvenient, and the communist bandits were rampant. As a result, Japan increased its land forces by more than 100,000. When the frontline fighting was most intense, the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army were still struggling to support it. Other troops in other areas were unable to provide support due to various constraints. Eventually, we had no choice but to retreat to the second line of defense. If China were not so corrupt internally and could use even half of its existing hundred-plus divisions to contend with the brutal Japanese, although we could not say we would directly attack Tokyo, we could at least preserve our territory and not lose an inch of land to the brutal Japanese. We always think that our daily food, clothing, housing, and all supplies come from the people's hard-earned money. If we cannot absolutely protect public order internally and cannot resist foreign invasion and defend the country externally, then as commander, I am very ashamed. You must have the same feeling. But is it enough for us to just feel ashamed? With our remaining lives, how should we strive to repel the brutal invaders, recover lost territories, and remove the shame in our hearts? You new comrades, since you are willing to be wholeheartedly loyal and be good revolutionary soldiers, how should we strengthen our strength to prepare for sacrifices against foreign enemies? In the recent battles in Shanghai by the 19th Route Army and our beloved 5th Army, although the sacrifices were great, the belief of all officers and soldiers in sacrificing themselves for the country has become even stronger and not diminished in the slightest. This is very comforting to me as commander. Speaking of the military pay of our army, I might as well briefly report on the financial situation of our army here. Since June of last year, when the 19th Route Army was responsible for the third phase of bandit suppression in Jiangxi, all military pay has been directly distributed by the central government (before June of last year, it was allocated nearby from Guangdong's national tax revenue). The original plan was to disburse a total of one million yuan per month for all marching and combat expenses and pay, but in reality, less than 80% was received. After November, it was reduced to 500,000 yuan. Eventually, due to the central government's financial difficulties, only an actual average of more than 300,000 yuan per month was received until March of this year. Just imagine how much pay your division demands each month. How can this meager sum of more than 300,000 yuan be distributed? Have you thought about the difficulties involved? Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, temporary military spending has suddenly increased. However, we have been able to make arrangements in every aspect and also provide assistance to friendly forces. Besides the more than 300,000 yuan allocated by the central government each month, where did this money come from? You probably all know that it all comes from the hard-earned money and enthusiastic support of compatriots from all walks of life in Shanghai, Guangdong, and various ports. How great our sacrifices are to resist the brutal Japanese invasion is our duty. We are not selling our fame with our blood and flesh, nor are we tools for anyone. We are sacrificing for the survival of the Chinese race based on our conscience and inner motivation. We truly feel ashamed and grateful for the excessive help from the people. In this battle, even after being ordered to retreat, some of you even failed to strictly abide by discipline and disturbed our compatriots. Although the matter is trivial, I feel more heartbroken and sad about this behavior than anything else. Also, some wounded soldiers caused trouble in the hospital, thinking that because they were injured, they could act arrogantly. These ignorant actions are truly hateful. Soldiers are supported by the state, and it is their duty to die on the battlefield. Can they act arrogantly just because they are injured? It has been reported that a small number of wounded soldiers ran to the concessions in Shanghai to cause trouble, were beaten and kicked by foreign police officers until they were half-dead, and then thrown out of the concessions. As dignified Chinese soldiers, they did not die on the battlefield but were trampled on by foreigners to this extent. This fully demonstrates that Chinese soldiers are uneducated and do not know how to respect themselves. You are all men of integrity, can you tolerate such humiliation? From now on, all wounded soldiers must absolutely abide by discipline. Otherwise, I will severely punish them. This is a bad impression that you have given me in terms of discipline, and I want you to pay close attention and correct it. Next, let me talk about the immaturity of the national character of our country. The prevalence and deep-rootedness of individualism and family concepts are the main causes of the nation's weakness today. Because education is not widespread, the vast majority of the people do not have the opportunity to receive education, resulting in the illiteracy rate reaching over 80% of the total population. The national character is immature due to lack of education, and coupled with the particularly strong traditional family concept that has been around for thousands of years, most people only recognize their families and hardly know what the country is. If the national situation is like this, how can the country become prosperous and strong? During the fierce battles between our army and the brutal Japanese in Shanghai, the communist bandits in Jiangxi not only failed to be awakened by the national crisis and unite to resist foreign aggression but instead took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on Ganzhou, attempting to seize the important southern Jiangxi city to disrupt our rear. This kind of behavior is tantamount to supporting the brutal Japanese and acting as their internal accomplice. We know that there are also communist parties in Japan and other countries. However, they are unwilling to disrupt their country from within and divide their government's strength against foreign aggression when their country is in trouble. Comparing the two, we can know what the Chinese national character is like. Therefore, if China wants to fundamentally become strong, it must popularize national education and raise the concept of the country. We should set an example for the whole country, sacrificing our families and ourselves, and dedicate our entire bodies to the country, permanently serving as tools of the country and the people. This is the most important point that I, as commander, want to encourage everyone to do together. I hope you will put it into practice."</p>

<h3 id="e77">Railway Bureau Proceeds with Restoring the Beijing-Shanghai Transportation <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Assist</p>
<p>The Traffic Department Convened a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Various Measures</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese armistice and troop withdrawal conference was signed by representatives of both sides yesterday morning as agreed. From now on, military actions will come to an end. The two railway bureaus have already planned to first restore traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Songhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Arrives in Shanghai: Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways dispatched Director Li of the General Affairs Department to Shanghai to assist the two railway bureaus in quickly restoring traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Songhu lines. He personally came to Shanghai to work with Director Chen of the bureau, Traffic Department Director Zheng Baozhao, and other relevant personnel. Li discussed and planned the implementation measures with Director Chen until around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Traffic Meeting: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Traffic Department Director Zheng Baozhao also convened key personnel of the Traffic Department to have a detailed discussion on starting to repair the Qingyanggang Railway Bridge and repairing the tracks. The meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM. According to Zheng, the implementation measures for restoring traffic have already been decided. It is expected that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be open to traffic in about two weeks. In the future, a temporary station will be set up at the North Station first.</p>
<p>Intensifying Work: The restoration of traffic is being jointly handled by personnel from the Traffic, Engineering, and Mechanical Departments. All bridges and tracks destroyed from Kunshan to the North Station are expected to be completely repaired within about five days. As soon as the Japanese army begins to withdraw, repairs will be rushed. Although yesterday was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as the Extraordinary President, when work should have been stopped, the bureau still worked all day to carry out all matters related to restoring traffic. The radio station has also been ordered to continue working as usual at night so that it can contact everything at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Chinese Association for the Protection of Children Welcomes Madam Xiao De <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Chinese Association for the Protection of Children held a tea party at its Shanghai War Zone Orphanage to welcome Madam Xiao De. A piece of white cloth was hung at the entrance, inscribed with the words "Welcome Madam Xiao De." Inside, the walls were plastered with slogans such as "Welcome the Great Mother," "Promote Parental Education," and "A Wise Mother Must Have a Wise Son," which were very moving. Those who attended included Zhu Qinglan, Mrs. Li Jinlun, Kong Xiangxi (represented by Xu Jianping), Hu Xuanming, Le Lingsheng, Chen Gengya, Zha Liangzhao, Anderson, Fei Wusheng, Mrs. Fu Bulan, Mrs. Wu Weide, Ms. Liu Wang Liming, Ms. Imanli, Ms. Tian Cuibao, Ms. Tang Liyuan, Wang Guanyi, Zhang Yueru, Chen Zhengfan, and more than 200 students from the orphanage. The meeting was chaired by Ms. Liu Wang Liming, vice president of the association, who delivered the opening remarks, stating that "Madam Xiao De is a heroic mother, a great mother, and a wise mother. She cultivated her son to fight for justice and humanity, which is a model for all mothers. With the example of Madam Xiao, the motherly way of the world will shine brightly. We firmly believe that human civilization originates in the cradle, which further increases our courage to promote the cause of protecting children." Then, President Kong Xiangxi gave a speech, stating that "Madam Xiao De's virtue is comparable to Mencius' mother in ancient China. Xiao De's death was not for nationalism but for universalism and for justice and humanity, which further increases our admiration. We deeply hope that Madam Xiao will restrain her grief. Xiao De's death was by no means in vain. The children present today and all over China are prepared to be the second Xiao De, and with the spirit of not fearing death, seek liberation for China itself and peace for the world." When Madam Xiao De stood up to answer, tears welled up in her eyes, which saddened all who saw her. The love of a mother for her son cannot be drowned by water or extinguished by fire. Her voice trembled extremely. Her reply stated, "I have no regrets that my son sacrificed himself for justice and humanity. He belongs to society and humanity, not to his parents privately. Therefore, his sacrifice is extremely right and proper. I came to China this time to bury my son, and I am very grateful for the sincere hospitality I have received from all parties. From what I have seen, China is a country full of potential and hopes to achieve peace and unification at an early date and embark on the path of construction and strength." Then, General Zhu Qinglan stood up and gave a speech, stating that "Xiao De's chivalrous spirit and righteousness are entirely due to his mother's education. For the sake of those of us who come to education and leave a permanent memory, we should urgently raise a large sum of money to establish the Xiao De Education Fund to cultivate geniuses among orphans, from elementary school to middle school to university, to become useful talents for society, to work for China, and to work for the world, so as not to fail Xiao De's sacrifice and Madam Xiao De's mother's education. This kind of commemoration can be called a living commemoration and a permanent commemoration." Everyone present strongly agreed with this suggestion, and then elected Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Qinglan, Fei Wusheng, Mrs. Li Jinlun, and Mrs. Fu Bulan as members of the preparatory committee, responsible for carrying out everything. Finally, Zhang Huaguang, a representative of the elementary school students, gave a speech, expressing his willingness to continue Xiao De's legacy and work hard for China and the world in the future. Madam Xiao De was very moved when she heard this. Afterwards, Chinese and foreign photographers came to take pictures, and Wu Weide and others guided Madam Xiao De to visit the orphanage. The meeting ended at about 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Reasons for Consolidating the Postal Foundation and Concrete Plan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Proposed by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union proposed a concrete plan to consolidate the postal foundation and requested that the Ministry of Communications adopt and implement the outline. The news was published in yesterday's newspaper. The four reasons for the plan are as follows: Reason 1: According to the postal service's opening, it was handled by the customs, and the government did not allocate a single penny. The customs advanced 2,487,000 yuan for the opening expenses. After 1922, the postal service gradually had a surplus and repaid it year by year. By 1926, it was fully repaid. From the same year, the postal service also paid the surplus to the former Ministry of Communications in Beijing. The detailed numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>1922: 855,000 yuan; 1923: 1,850,000 yuan; 1924: 1,940,000 yuan; 1925: 1,890,000 yuan; 1926: 1,990,000 yuan; 1927: 292,000 yuan; a total of 8,817,000 yuan. After the establishment of the National Government's Ministry of Communications, the postal service paid the Ministry of Communications as follows: From 1929, it paid the Ministry of Communications 30,000 yuan per month for regular expenses, 360,000 yuan per year, which was reimbursed in the regular expenditure account of the Postal Administration. 1929: 480,000 yuan (including part of 1928); 1930: 360,000 yuan; 1931: 360,000 yuan; 1932: 120,000 yuan (calculated up to April); a total of 1,320,000 yuan. Since July 1931, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has also paid the Ministry of Communications 30,000 yuan per month from the regular expenses, which is also postal money, totaling 300,000 yuan up to April of this year. In addition, the Postal Administration followed the order of the Ministry of Communications and divided the annual surplus equally, half of which was retained by the bureau for construction and development, and half was paid to the ministry, which was said to be used for other construction projects. The detailed numbers are as follows: 1928: 245,000 yuan; 1929: 580,000 yuan; 1930: 484,000 yuan; a total of 1,309,000 yuan. In addition, the Postal Administration was ordered to pay 2,000,000 yuan for the construction of the Ministry's office building in Nanjing Sajiawan. In addition, the Postal Administration was ordered to allocate 1,000,000 yuan for the Ministry of Communications to open the Shanghai-Chengdu airline. In addition, when China National Aviation Corporation was established, the Post Office was ordered to allocate 2,000,000 yuan. In addition, when Eurasia Aviation Corporation was established, the Post Office was again ordered to allocate 500,000 yuan. The total of the above items is 8,429,000 yuan. The actual amount of the current postal deficit is only more than 4,000,000 yuan. The so-called budget shortfall of 10,000,000 yuan includes more than 5,000,000 yuan for construction applications. If it had not been affected by politics for more than ten years, that is, if the principle of "supporting the postal service with the postal service" had been realized, and the postal surplus had only belonged to the postal service, and had not been paid to the Ministry of Communications, and had not borne the cost of opening aviation, then by the end of last year, the postal surplus would have reached 17,724,600 yuan. Even if it had been hit by occasional natural disasters or foreign aggression, and had a deficit of more than 4,000,000 yuan, it would still have had savings of 12,000,000 yuan. Why would it be at a loss and make the people, who have survived so many disasters, bear so much burden? Therefore, the way to maintain the foundation of the postal service lies in maintaining the economic independence of the postal service. In other words, it is the principle of "supporting the postal service with the postal service." The purpose of the state in running the postal service is to facilitate the people, not to make profits. This is the general practice in all countries in the world. Therefore, all countries allocate funds to subsidize the postal service. The postal service in our country is still in its infancy. It is too late to support it. How can we divide its surplus to support other businesses and limit its development, and make its foundation unstable? If it encounters wind and rain, it will feel shaky. This is the first basis of this plan. In addition to the above-mentioned 17,724,600 yuan paid to the Beijing and Nanjing Ministry of Communications and 2,500,000 yuan returned to the customs, the postal service still had a fund of 2,500,000 yuan before the establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and about 1,000,000 yuan from the self-run insurance. In the annual settlement of the previous year, in the past ten years (since 1922), in addition to expanding business and adding more than 12,350 bureaus and offices and opening up 852,600 miles of postal routes with the progress of culture and commerce, it actually made a surplus of 23,324,600 yuan. Calculated by the average of ten years, there can be 2,300,000 yuan per year. Not only do we not have to worry about the coming of natural disasters, but if we use it to the fullest extent to develop, its rate of progress may be more than what it is today. This is the second basis of this plan. Based on the above two points, and in accordance with the suggestion of Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Communications that he should work and handle things on behalf of others, we have proposed the principle of "supporting the postal service with the postal service" so that the money spent by the people for using the postal service (i.e., postage) is effectively used for the postal service and does not flow to other channels. From the perspective of the state's entire plan, transportation businesses are all for the convenience of the people and should not be biased towards the postal service. However, the deficit of the telegraph service is too large, and the aviation administration needs even more money. If we want to use the income of the large-scale postal service to support it, then what is the difference between holding a heavy load of a thousand pounds and ordering a three-foot-tall child to carry it? It will inevitably lead to both sides losing. It is better to first maintain one and help it grow, and then find other ways to remedy the others. If all the surplus, except for 10% for personnel pensions and 20% for the base, is used for the construction and development of the postal service, this fund will accumulate day by day, and even if there are natural disasters in the future, there will be no increase in postal rates.

<h3 id="e81">The Book Industry Re-telegrams to Request the Cancellation of Postage Increase <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The book industry re-telegraphed the government, saying: (1) To President Lin of the Luoyang National Government, Standing Committee Members Jiang, Wang, and Hu of the Nanjing Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Education: The increase in postage for books hinders the development of education and culture in the border provinces. The association has repeatedly telegraphed to request the withdrawal of the decision. Recently, it was found that the elementary school textbooks priced at 6 to 12 cents and with an actual price of 80% off, according to the new postal regulations, cost 1 cent for each book for simple postage, with 2 cents for light books and 5 cents for heavy books; 2 cents for simple postage, with 4 cents for light books and 10 cents for heavy books; 3 cents for simple postage, with 6 cents for light books and 15 cents for heavy books. Adding 10 cents for simple registration, the postage for purchasing and sending books and letters back and forth is 12 cents. If all are simply registered, an additional 20 cents is required. After careful calculation, it is shocking. On May 3, it was reported that Vice Minister Chen and Director Qian talked about the new postal regulations and also believed that it did hinder the culture of the border provinces and decided to restore the old regulations. If a gentleman makes a mistake, if he does not know it deeply, but now he knows it and cancels it, it will not only not damage the government's prestige, but also show the government's fairness and selflessness, its compassion for the people's suffering, and its concern for culture. In recent days, out-of-town postal purchases of books have been accompanied by postage based on the old regulations. It is inconvenient for the member bookstores of the association to deliver them according to the old regulations, and they feel at a loss as to what to do, which will only increase the difficulties over time. Therefore, we re-telegraph to request your order, and earnestly request immediate cancellation, and we will be grateful. Shanghai Book Industry Association. (2) To Acting President Qin and all members of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan: On May 1, the Shen Bao reported that the decision of your Yuan and the Ministry of Communications to increase postage was illegal, and requested the government to stop its implementation. This shows that your Yuan upholds the law and is not biased, and does not want to easily increase the burden on the people. We are grateful. On the 3rd, it was reported that Vice Minister Chen Fumu said that the Legislative Yuan had resolved to stop the increase in postage because the matter had not been reviewed and approved by the Yuan. He did not know the details in Shanghai, but he knew that the postage increase would not be stopped because of this. We are deeply surprised. If the Deputy Minister of Communications can ignore the resolution of the Legislative Yuan, then the balance of powers will be lost, and the legislature will be regarded as a sacrificial sheep. No wonder Western newspapers say that this matter can test whether China respects the spirit of legislation and implements the budget and final accounts. We urge you to uphold a just attitude and a fearless spirit, and to stop this kind of postal rate increase that destroys legislation, increases the burden on the people, and hinders culture and education in accordance with the law. We are eagerly waiting. Shanghai Book Industry Association.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Telegram from the Commerce Staff Welfare Committee <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>To the National Government Executive Yuan Legislative Yuan Ministry of Education in Luoyang, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and all sectors of society: During this invasion by the violent Japanese, the General Factory of the Commercial Press in Zhabei was destroyed, and the families of all employees suffered the same devastating calamity. The employees are displaced and suffering immensely. It has been three months, and the company authorities have repeatedly failed to provide any relief or support to the employees since the incident, harboring ulterior motives with the stored funds and refusing withdrawals in an attempt to cut off their economic lifeline. Recently, the company has established a new factory in Shanghai, and the printing plants in Beiping and Hong Kong have been greatly expanded. Dozens of branches have also never ceased operation. We had hoped to resume work immediately and alleviate the suffering, but the company has suddenly become even more ruthless, falsely reporting to the authorities in an attempt to dismiss all employees, taking advantage of the national crisis to expand personal power. The Municipal Social Bureau not only fails to severely reprimand this behavior but even tends to approve it, allowing the capitalists to deprive the workers of their various legitimate interests. Upon hearing this news, the committee is extremely alarmed. We have observed that since the Shanghai Incident, the Municipal Social Bureau has repeatedly announced that factories are not allowed to take advantage of the situation to attempt dismissals. Now, for the cultural laborers who have suffered significant devastation from the Japanese invaders for many years, we have not heard of any relief from the Bureau. If the Bureau listens to the capitalists and dismisses all employees amidst the extremely challenging recovery situation, watching thousands of employees leave the factory they have worked hard to build for thirty-six years to become unemployed vagrants, it would not only violate the Bureau's own laws but also disregard the workers' hardship. How could a government under the clear blue sky do such a thing? The committee is in a state of extreme anxiety at this critical moment. We can only beg for compassion for the employees who have contributed to the nation's culture and provide relief to them in this desperate situation. We implore you to order the Bureau not to rely on the capitalists' one-sided story and to disregard the truth of the facts, sacrificing the jobs and legal rights of four thousand employees, and to order the company to find ways to resume work and not to attempt dismissals arbitrarily. We also seek the public opinion of all sectors of society. We would be immensely grateful, not only for the sake of the employees but also for the sake of society. We respectfully send this telegram for your consideration. From the Shanghai Commercial Press Employee Relief Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Anti-Drug Association Responds to Gao You Tang's Impeachment of Liu Rui Heng <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, in response to the news report of yesterday that Gao You Tang, a member of the Control Yuan, impeached Liu Rui Heng, the chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee, for condoning the spread of drugs and harming the country, launched a joint discussion with various groups and telegraphed national anti-drug groups, urging them to rise up and resist and respond remotely in order to achieve the goal of punishing officials and benefiting the prohibition of smoking. The telegraph is recorded as follows: "Express Delivery, to the National Anti-Drug Association, the Anti-Drug Propaganda Association, and various Anti-Drug Groups: Since Liu Rui Heng has been in charge of the Anti-Smoking Committee, the prohibition of smoking has been lax and unbearable. At the beginning, he cited those who advocated public sales, such as Wu Liande, and famous donors, such as Li Jihong, to collude for personal gain, condone the sale of drugs, suppress the anti-drug movement, and destroy the vitality of the nation. The establishment of the Anti-Smoking Investigation Office and the promotion of the management agency for narcotic drugs were fortunately opposed by anti-drug groups and the people across the country, which slightly discouraged the thieves. Recently, foreign insults have invaded, and the country is in a crisis. When the eyes of the people are concentrated on the outside world, Liu believes it is a good opportunity to move around, instigating provinces to carry out opium public sales in order to disperse the people's resistance. The central government will also formally announce the fact of public sales in the shortest period of time, trying to speed up the country's demise. Now that Gao Youtang, a member of the Control Yuan, has filed an impeachment, requesting the government to punish him according to law, it is gratifying. We hope that your association will continue to rise up and strive to respond to Gao's impeachment, save a glimmer of light for the anti-drug movement, and prevent Liu from condoning the sale of drugs and harming the country as he pleases. The future of anti-drug is very fortunate. Chinese National Anti-Drug Association. Seal."</p>

<p>Via Haizhou and Qingdao</p>
<p>Requesting Protection from All Regions</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the China National Aviation Corporation, it has spared no effort in developing routes. In addition to the Shanghai-Hankou-Chongqing line that has already been opened, it is now preparing to open the Shanghai-Tianjin line. This line will take off from Shanghai, pass through Haizhou and Qingdao, and arrive in Tianjin. This line will also use seaplanes to fly along the coast. It is now scheduled to conduct a test flight from Shanghai on the 9th of this month. It will land in Haizhou and Qingdao to observe the situation. At that time, the company's most skilled American pilot, Mr. Erilison, will fly the plane. The company has already telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, requesting that it inform the garrison in Haizhou and the municipal governments of Qingdao and Tianjin to provide protection and convenience when the plane arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Taxpayers' Association Protests Minimum Electricity Fee Again <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Practical and Actual Collection is Still the Most Reasonable</p>
<p>Two-Thirds of the Meter Deposit Should be Returned</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent another letter to the Public Works Department yesterday regarding the minimum electricity fee and meter deposit of the electricity company, saying: "To the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, regarding the case of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's minimum electricity fee and the return of two-thirds of the meter deposit, your bureau replied that the monthly minimum electricity fee is one tael and two and a half qian of silver. As for the meter deposit, the bureau is already in the process of returning part of it, etc. The association believes that the amount of the returned meter deposit should be determined as two-thirds of the amount collected when it was collected every three months. There is no legal reason to change it. The Shanghai Electric Power Company's statement published in the newspaper yesterday seems unwilling to return two-thirds. The reasons it stated are not sufficient to explain the situation when it was collected every three months. When collecting electricity fees every three months, it may not be necessary to collect them outside of three months, so the meter deposit set at that time has been considered. Now it has been changed to collecting once a month, so the guarantee required should only be one-third of the previous one. Moreover, the delay in collection is a matter for the company, what does it have to do with the users? Users have no obligation to bear more stagnant funds. The statement also made many statements about the minimum electricity fee, but according to the observation of the association, practical and actual collection is still legal and reasonable. The company's investment is originally a whole, and the income from electricity fees, if it only belongs to production costs, the association's observation is of course wrong, otherwise, this method is extremely contrary to the law. Since it is not a contract system, it should be practical and actual collection. As for the bill, it will be delivered immediately after it is sent. Correspondently, please investigate and handle it according to the association's opinion and instruct the Shanghai Electric Power Company to handle it. This is to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Wounded Soldier Hospitals Close One After Another <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>When the Japanese army invaded, all sectors of society were motivated by righteous indignation and set up wounded soldier hospitals. The 25th Wounded Soldier Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society was founded by Qian Longzhang, Ye Zibo, Zhang Kelun, and other gentlemen of the Chinese Western Medicine Association and was affiliated with the Fuxu Road Sanatorium. Hundreds of wounded officers were cured successively, especially soldiers from the Nineteenth Route Army, the Eighty-Eighth Division, and the Citizens' Volunteer Army. As for the hospital's expenses, they were all borne separately by members of the Western Medicine Association. It is now learned that the hospital is closing down recently because the ceasefire agreement has been signed, and wounded soldier hospitals in various places have been closed one after another. Therefore, the hospital also began to handle the closure yesterday. Honorary medals were awarded to volunteer doctors who served in the hospital as a souvenir.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department to Punish Donation Collectors for Abuse of Power <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Chief of the Public Concession Public Works Department yesterday, saying: "According to the letter from Wang Xishen, President of Zhengfeng College, this time the Japanese army used force and violence, thanks to the concession as a protector and for the convenience of acting, all Chinese people are deeply indignant. Our school is close to West Shanghai. When the battle was fought, Japanese soldiers often drove by in front of the door, carrying live ammunition and glaring fiercely, causing extreme panic. After the war ended, in order to take care of the students' studies, we reluctantly opened school, about April 10th. Normally, there are nearly two hundred students, but this year only thirty-odd students came due to the impact of the war. The school's financial situation is extremely difficult, and it is entirely maintained by my personal family. This unexpected sudden change has made it even more stretched. Therefore, the Public Works Department's spring patrol donation was unable to be paid for a while. Whenever the donation collector came, I politely asked him to postpone the collection, and I was tolerated. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 a.m. on April 29, a Western investigator Mr. Mai from the patrol room donation office suddenly came with a Chinese translator, claiming to be surnamed Wang. Their arrogance was overwhelming. The Westerner remained silent, but Wang did not ask the reason, but acted rudely and forced me to sign my name on the donation receipt, saying that if the donation was not paid before 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, he would file a lawsuit against me at the police station. I think the education career is different from others. The impact of this war is huge, and it is the same for all industries. Under this special circumstance, it cannot be measured by normal circumstances. Throughout the Public Works Department's report and various documents of your association, there have been many discussions about preferential treatment for the education sector. Even if it cannot be implemented for a while, this donation cannot be reduced or exempted immediately, but it seems reasonable to give a little time due to the environment. Why did you suddenly use this threatening method? The so-called deadline for payment and the lawsuit after the deadline were not seen at all from the Westerner, and all of them were made by the translator himself, which is even more shocking. In addition to writing to the Finance Committee to request a reduction, I will report the situation to the meeting truthfully. After investigating that the Japanese soldiers' invasion of Shanghai this time has resulted in the complete loss of normality and the exhaustion of the social economy, all unstable forces, and all those who have interests, are trying to eliminate them in order to restore normality as soon as possible. The taxpayers and your bureau should strive for effective cooperation and work together to overcome this difficulty. Unexpectedly, the translator Wang did not know the meaning of the taxpayers and your bureau, abused his power, and threatened them, which is enough to cause misunderstandings and cause disputes. Your bureau should especially maintain the education career of the college to show respect for the taxpayers and the importance of education. According to the previous letter, I respectfully request you to investigate, in addition to exempting the college from the total donation, and to punish the translator Wang for abusing his power and provoking resentment. This is to the Chief of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<p>Another Way Out for Refugees</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, North Shanghai suffered severely from the Japanese army's ravages, and countless compatriots were displaced. There are still more than 40,000 people with skills who cannot be settled. Although various relief societies have tried their best to accommodate them, the cost is huge and difficult to support for a long time. Recently, a Livelihood Self-Help Society was organized, which plans to cooperate with the refugee factories of the Livelihood Improvement Society to implement the opening of mobile stores. The store clerks are filled by refugees, specializing in selling domestic goods and making their own profits. The plan is very precise. The society's preparatory committee has now been established, and the promoters are Li Denghui, Hu Shuhua, Li Zhaohuan, Liang Shichun, Ji Kangfu, Wang Gang, Song Fuhua, and Ye Jingfeng. The steps are to first contact various shelters and simultaneously raise start-up funds from charitable organizations and philanthropists. It is said that the method is to form a group of five people, and each group needs about 100 yuan for start-up costs. The first batch plans to form 100 groups, select refugees with sales experience, and then add new training before starting.</p>

<p>Ma Yifa, Fifteen Years Old</p>
<p>Wearing Diamond Ring Worth Over a Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Kidnappers in Desperation Kill Chauffeur</p>
<p>Hostage Once Kidnapped Before</p>
<p>Ma Yifa, the fifth son of Ma Changsheng, a well-known antique merchant in this city, was kidnapped in front of his residence on Glock Road in the French Concession at around 7:00 a.m. yesterday. Xia Baosheng, the chauffeur of the Ma residence, was shot dead by the bandits on the spot because he bravely resisted. The detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Antique Market Ma Changsheng, a native of Jinling, is 57 years old and follows Islam. He started his business by operating antiques, jade, and jewelry and owns a huge amount of capital. He built a large building at the corner of Glock Road and Ailai Ge Road in the French Concession, with the address numbers 74 to 76, with the Ma Chang Ji brand hanging at the door. On the surface, it is a residence and a business, but it is actually a large-scale antique market. Ma's trade is mostly with foreign businessmen, especially with the Three Islands, so he is well-known. Almost all antique dealers at home and abroad know Ma Chang Ji.</p>
<p>Yifa Limps Ma has many children. His elder and younger brothers are all adults. The fifth son is named Yifa, is 15 years old, and has a limp. The sixth son, Shunfa, is 12 years old, and another son is named Yongfu, is 13 years old. These three sons are studying at Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road in the Public Concession. They use their own car No. 262 to travel back and forth every morning and evening. Xia Baosheng (56 years old) and Xia Shunde (23 years old), father and son, are hired as chauffeurs. Xia lives at 433 Bopai Road, Datiebang. He goes early and returns late every day and serves diligently, which is deeply trusted by the master.</p>
<p>Bandits Suddenly Arrive At 7:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the chauffeur Xia Baosheng drove the car as usual, intending to send the young masters to school. At that time, he parked the car outside the back door. Yifa and the other three walked into the car in a row. As soon as they were seated, Xia Baosheng was about to start the engine when four bandits with a Northern accent suddenly rushed out of the alleys of Fuqingli and Guianli across the road, two holding box cannons and two holding pistols. Two bandits first guarded the left and right doors of the car, and the other two bandits ran to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>Chauffeur Sacrifices Master At this critical moment, the chauffeur Xia Baosheng saw that the situation was not good and knew that he had encountered bandits. He quickly locked the hidden lock installed on the car door with his backhand, and shouted for help loudly. The bandits repeatedly pried the handle of the car door, but they could not push it even a little. The bandits were anxious and smashed the glass with the butt of the gun, intending to reach in and open the door. Xia resisted bravely, and the bandits became even more anxious and fired a shot at Xia. The bullet hit the right chest breast, penetrated the back, and died in the car.</p>
<p>Kidnapping the Hostage After the bandits killed the chauffeur, they hurriedly opened the car door, pulled Yifa out of the car, and put him in a bandit car parked near Ningbo Road. A bandit driver drove at full speed and escaped without a trace. At that time, Ma's family had already heard the police, and hurriedly reported to the Songshan Road Police Station by phone, frantically sounded the siren, and the male and female servants rushed out to take the two children, Shunfa and Yongfu, out of the car. However, the two children were young and timid. They witnessed the chauffeur being shot and the elder brother being kidnapped, and they were already as pale as wood and lifeless.</p>
<p>Diamond Ring Worth a Lot After a while, Chinese and Western detectives from the Songshan Road Police Station and the special agency rushed to the scene one after another and rounded up in all directions. However, the bandits had already fled far away without a trace. They asked the nearby shops about the bandits' clothes and appearance, and reported to the head of the police. A detective sent Xia Baoshan's body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch autopsy office to wait for the court to send a court inspector to inspect it today. It is said that Yifa is young and intelligent and is loved by his parents. When he was kidnapped, he was wearing a diamond ring worth 1,350 yuan on his finger. However, Yifa was kidnapped once eight years ago and lived in the bandit's den for two months. Later, he was rescued by the French police. After the incident, the police found that Zhang Zhihua, the bodyguard who had recently stopped working at Ma's house, was suspected and was summoned for questioning. He was ordered to be handed over to Bao Houhe. The police station notified the Public Concession Police Station and the Huajie Public Security Bureau to investigate the bandits' whereabouts. Therefore, the Public Concession inspected pedestrians and questioned cars very strictly last night.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Vengeance Killing of Ji Zhongtang <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Tragic Case in the Japanese-Occupied Area</p>
<p>Head, Breast, Eyes, Waist, and Ribs All Hit by Bullets</p>
<p>Ji Zhongtang, 34 years old, a native of Yancheng, used to be a detective in the Fifth District of Zhabei. He was detained by the local court and sentenced to two years in prison for falsely accusing good people of theft, injuring suspects, and extorting silk machines, and was sent to prison for execution. He was released last month. The day before yesterday, Ji went to visit his apprentice Zhang Xiaowanzi, who lived in Zhangjiaxiang, Hujia Muqiao, and went to a small teahouse opened by Wei Cheshi to drink tea with Zhang. Unexpectedly, his enemies found out and gathered many people, each holding a pistol, and said to Ji, "The three-year revenge has finally been met. You have thrown yourself into the trap." Ji knew that it was difficult to escape, and wanted to beg for mercy, but the bullets had already come. Ji immediately dodged, but several shots were fired, and Ji suffered five or six gunshot wounds to the head, breast, eyes, waist, and ribs. He immediately fell to the ground and died in a pool of blood. The murderers all fled. According to Zhang Xiaowanzi, the murderers were the rogue Wang Shubao, Wang Sanmingzi, Zheng Xiaoheizi, etc. Afterwards, the Japanese military headquarters sent personnel to the scene to verify the situation, and the body was coffined. Yesterday, the local security guard Xu Jinlin, together with Zhang Xiaowanzi Wei Cheshi, carried the body coffin to the Nanshi to request the local court to inspect the body. Wu, the prosecutor, opened the coffin to inspect it, filled in the body form, and ordered it to be carried back to wait for the arrest of the murderer.</p>

<p>Love Fades Over Time and Sues in Court</p>
<p>Criminal Case Could Not Be Established</p>
<p>Diamond Ring and Cash Were Ordered to be Returned</p>
<p>Yang Xianbang Imprisoned Without Bail</p>
<p>Yang Xianbang, the former measuring director of the Industrial Patrol Donation Bureau, is now a consultant to the Henan Security Department. When he was working in the Industrial Patrol Donation Bureau, he went to the Robert Li Hospital on Manufacturing Bureau Road for treatment because of illness. There was a young widow, Tao Shuzhen, in the hospital, and he fell in love with her. From then on, they fell in love with each other, and like Sima Xiangru and Zhuo Wenjun, they hit it off. Therefore, they lived together next to the South Guild Hall. Since Yang's business was dismissed after the revolution, their love gradually cooled down and eventually broke down. Tao once hired a lawyer to sue Yang Xianbang for demolition, seduction, and fraud. As a result, he could not be punished criminally, and the civil court ruled that Yang Xianbang should return a diamond ring and 3,000 yuan in cash to Tao Shuzhen. The execution has been confirmed, and Yang immediately went to Henan to take office. However, the rent of the house where Tao lived was paid by Yang. After the love broke down, the rent was not paid. Luo Shushi, the accountant of the South Guild Hall, requested the local court to order the relocation, which has been approved. Tao believed that this was a trick of Yang's, so she sued Yang and his wife Wang Weilin for bigamy and abandonment, and also implicated Luo Shushi. The reason was that Yang and she had lived together and had a three-chapter covenant, and the relatives considered them husband and wife. The court repeatedly arrested Yang but failed to arrive and issued a warrant for arrest. He was arrested at the Oriental Hotel. Tao pointed out that Wang Yueying, a girlfriend in the same room, was his wife who committed bigamy. After being prosecuted by the prosecutor, the criminal court has repeatedly tried the case. The day before yesterday, the court ruled that the Tao Shuzhen's lawsuit against Yang Xianbang, Wang Weilin, and Wang Yueying was not accepted in part, and Luo Shushi was not guilty. Unexpectedly, the criminal court had just made a ruling, and the civil execution court had learned that Yang Xianbang had been arrested, and ordered the officer Wang Guocheng to bring Yang from the criminal court. After questioning, he ordered him to be bailed out to pay off the debt. At that time, there was no bail, so he was ordered to be detained. The river of love has many obstacles, which can be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Issue of Director Ye Shantao in the Riyue Bank Case <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Key Lies in Huang Chuqiu's Letter</p>
<p>Witness Gan Yuesong Failed to Appear Yesterday</p>
<p>After the collapse of Riyue Bank, its creditor, Dong Longxing, and others filed a lawsuit against Ye Shantao, a director of the bank, accusing him of forging a letter from the deceased Huang Chuqiu, which allegedly approved Ye's resignation as a director, in an attempt to evade debt liability. The initial trial found the plaintiff's reasoning insufficient and acquitted Ye. Dong and others were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court through Yan Luqing. The court had previously summoned [those involved], as reported in previous newspapers. The continuation of the trial was scheduled for the day before yesterday, but the key witness, Gan Yuesong, failed to appear. According to the appellant, Ye Shantao, Gan Yuesong initially agreed to appear as a witness but, unexpectedly, on the day before the trial, he suddenly claimed he was British and unwilling to appear in court without a British consular summons. Therefore, he was absent. Subsequently, Judge Zhao handed over the Riyue Bank's account books to Ye for review and questioned him about entries indicating he was a director and received carriage allowance [夫馬費]. Ye claimed he only served as a consultant for the bank and received carriage allowance as a consultant. The court stated that the key to the case lay in the authenticity of the letter. Since Gan Yuesong possessed a letter from Huang Chuqiu, it was necessary for Gan Yuesong to appear in court to testify whether the handwriting of Huang's letter presented by Ye Shantao was the same as the one held by Gan, and whether both letters were indeed signed by Huang. Therefore, the court adjourned the case and rescheduled it to summon Gan Yuesong for further questioning.</p>

<p>One Suspect Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 11:00 AM, Madam Zhu Zhang, a local woman residing at 15 Gubal Road in the French Concession, was traveling on a small boat along Suzhou Creek towards Xiang. While passing near the Fuxin No. 3 Flour Mill, several robbers who had emerged from the north bank jumped onto the boat and stole 100 silver dollars from Zhang before fleeing back ashore. Because the north bank was still within the Japanese military occupation zone, Zhang reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station of the Public Concession, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, a suspect named Ji Zhenhong from Yancheng was apprehended along with his wife, Ji He, and both were transferred to the Customs Water Police Station for handling. After questioning, the police station determined that Ji had not committed any criminal acts and released him in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Letters Found on Body</p>
<p>Seemingly Returning Home for a Wedding</p>
<p>The Hexing steamship of the Zhaoxing Company arrived at the Longmao Warehouse pier in Lujiazui, Pudong, at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday. A passenger suddenly became acutely ill, unable to speak. The ship's accountant, Liu Shuming, ordered a tea server to transport him to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, upon reaching the hospital entrance, the man's face turned pale, froth appeared in his mouth, and he died. Liu immediately reported the incident to the Third District Public Security Bureau, which notified the local bailiff, Xie Along, who in turn reported it to the local court. At 2:00 PM, Prosecutor Shen was commissioned to cross the river to Pudong for an inspection. The deceased was approximately 20 years old, wearing a dark blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers. It was determined that he had died of illness, and no relatives were found. An order was issued for photographs to be taken and the body to be collected, pending identification by relatives. A letter and a diary were found in the deceased's pocket, along with a five-cent exchange certificate from the Dongsan Province Bank. The letter was addressed to Chen Runxi, care of Dong Fahe at Shihhezhi on the Middle East Railway in Jilin, with the address listed as Chen, Guangji County, Hubei Province. The tone of the letter suggested it was from a father to his son, stating that the son had been away for several years and the letter writer had just learned of the son's address. The father stated that the son must return home this winter, regardless of whether he had money, to get married. The letter noted that there had been severe flooding at home this year but the family was safe, so the son need not worry. Based on this, the deceased was undoubtedly Chen Runxi himself. The letter is now kept on file at the Third District for future reference.</p>

<p>Residual Poison from the Japanese Army's War</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Sheng and Shen Hualin Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, farmers Liu Xiang Sheng and Shen Hualin from Shenjia Zhai in Jiangwan were tilling the fields, preparing to plant flowers (referring to cotton). Unexpectedly, they accidentally triggered a landmine buried by the Japanese army. The explosion was loud. It was heard in quiet areas of the city such as Zhabei, and was even mistaken for artillery fire from Wusong. Liu and Shen were thrown into the air by the explosion. After landing, they were buried in the soil. After hearing the explosion, Japanese soldiers rushed to the scene and carried Liu and Shen to a Japanese military hospital for treatment. However, Liu Xiang Sheng and Shen Hualin were severely injured. Yesterday morning, the Japanese soldiers ordered villagers to carry Liu and Shen to the Jiangwan Refugee Association on Gulou Road in the Public Concession, using a wooden door. Liu's face, chest, back, hands, and feet were severely injured. Shrapnel had penetrated his skin, making him look like burnt wood. Shen was also seriously injured and over 50 years old. The association immediately sent them to the Chinese Red Cross Society's No. 33 Military Hospital. It is uncertain whether they will survive.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry believes that the Chinese silk industry has reached a critical state. To find a solution, the bureau's trade guide has sought rescue plans from silk experts both domestically and abroad, and has prepared questions to solicit opinions from silk industry experts and silk manufacturers in various regions for compilation and discussion. The questions are as follows: (1) There are many reasons for the failure of the Chinese silk industry. In your opinion, what are the most important factors, and what should be improved first? (2) There are large quantities of silk and cocoons in storage in Shanghai and other regions. How should the government and the people handle them? Farmers will be unable to sell this year's new cocoons after they are harvested. What methods can be used to compensate them? (3) Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, most of the old silk factories have been destroyed. What should be the future direction of silk production? (4) How will the American boycott of Japanese goods affect Japanese silk? Is it possible for Chinese silk to take advantage of this opportunity, and how should it be done?</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>With the utmost respect, I write to inform you that your esteemed newspaper reported a bombing in Hongkou and that the Korean revolutionary leader An Changhao, among others, was arrested at No. 27 Baokang Lane, Xiafei Road. No. 27 is my residence, where I have lived for many years, and I have never had any Koreans visit. An Changhao was apprehended at No. 54 in the same lane. I suspect this is a misreporting of hearsay. However, since your esteemed newspaper published this news, well-meaning individuals have come to inquire or investigate, which is truly distressing. I am writing to respectfully request a correction, for which I will be extremely grateful. With sincere wishes, Pu Baosheng respectfully writes.</p>
<p>Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>In the news of the Huining Guild Hall's banquet published in your esteemed newspaper the day before yesterday, not a single word recorded as my speech was spoken by me. I hereby request a correction. Xu Bailong.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>According to a letter from the entrusting party, Dada Steamboat Co., Ltd., the Shenbao newspaper on the 4th of this month published a piece entitled "The Resolution of the Dade Steamboat Disaster" which differs from the facts, and requested the investigative team to write to request a correction. Our firm's investigation of the aftermath of the Dada Steamboat disaster found that there was no compensation or compensation for the victims' families, as the matter was based on the resolution of the shipping industry council and the principles of civil and commercial law. Only the China Relief Society, upon the company's invitation, provided relief funds, which were used to send the families back to their hometowns. The actual amount of relief money was 2,400 yuan, which is far from the tens of thousands of dollars mentioned in your newspaper. As the lawyer involved in this case from beginning to end, I have all the records available for verification. I am writing this letter to request a correction to match the facts and maintain a friendly relationship. Respectfully, Lawyer Zhang Shizhao, May 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Reasons for the Student Strike at Xuzhou Middle School in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Higher Normal Students Demand Funds for Study Tours</p>
<p>The Department of Education Orders Temporary Suspension Due to Lack of Provincial Funds</p>
<p>Supervisor Yi Sent to Xuzhou to Handle Issue; Faculty and Staff Issue Declaration</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Xuzhou Middle School, reorganized from the former Provincial Tenth Middle School and Seventh Normal School, is now composed of two academies at the site of the two schools. Recently, its management has been relatively stable, and Principal Xue Zhongtai is also regarded as a sound educational administrator. A month ago, the higher normal students in the first academy demanded study tours as per regulations, as their graduation approached, but the Department of Education ordered a temporary suspension due to lack of provincial funds. The higher normal students consequently went on strike to express their demands. Principal Xue's dissuasion was ineffective. The school petitioned the provincial authorities, which ordered a strict prohibition and rectification of the school's atmosphere. If disobeyed, the leading students would be expelled. Principal Xue was unwilling to take such measures, so the higher normal students united with the entire student body and went on strike, issuing a declaration against Principal Xue. Thus, the student movement began on April 29th. The teachers also left the school due to the environment, temporarily staying at the Jiangbei Hotel. Principal Xue reported to the provincial authorities and personally went to the province to seek instructions. The Department of Education replied to Principal Xue's telegram stating: (1) "Received your telegram. The students' agitation of their classmates and expansion of the movement is intolerable. You must still follow the previous order and take strict measures. If the students do not obey, a major sacrifice will be unavoidable." The county of Tongshan has been instructed to assist in handling the matter. (2) "Received your telegram. Instructed the county magistrate of Tongshan County to assist in handling the matter. This case must be strictly investigated and dealt with to rectify the school's atmosphere." After Xue presented his case in person at the province, the Department of Education has dispatched Provincial Supervisor Yi Zuolin to Xuzhou to handle the matter. Yi arrived at the school on the 3rd. It is anticipated that the authorities will take severe measures in handling this student movement. Because the students' declaration was misleading to the public, the faculty and staff issued a declaration under their collective names to truthfully recount the events of the student movement.</p>

<p>After the 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Frontline Stretcher Team (incorporated into the 78th Division) also retreated with the army. The team leader, Ye Chunnian, also gathered a second group of team members and rushed to the front, abandoning their families and sacrificing their occupations, in order to seek long-term resistance through cooperation between the military and civilians. They have been working on the front line for three months. Now, due to the signing of the armistice agreement, the headquarters of the 19th Route Army will also move back. The commander of the 78th Division, in view of the end of the war and the fact that the voluntary long-term service of the team members was not a long-term plan, ordered the team to be disbanded yesterday. A notice will be issued to all officers and soldiers in the next few days to bid them farewell and send them back to Shanghai from Suzhou. It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce intends to issue orders to the companies and shops where the members worked before their departure, to restore their original positions as before.</p>

<h3 id="e123">With Constant Financial Fluctuations, Gold Prices Finally Soften <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Down by Three Taels and a Half: Yesterday's Spring Races have ended, and the Gold Exchange is operating in both the forward and spot markets. Marked gold continues to soften, but its rise and fall are unpredictable. Throughout the day, there were seven taels of difference. In the end, it fell by more than three taels. The supply and demand of each firm is quite divergent. The morning was weak, all because of the rise in the silver market. Afterwards, buyers were flexible, and the foreign exchange market changed from loose to stable, showing a high rise. However, people's hearts are erratic, and sellers are unremitting, and the market turned downstream again, hovering outside 740 taels. The market outlook is not good. Rumors are spreading that there are fierce battles in the Northeast, and it is also heard that someone assassinated a leader of a certain country, resulting in more sellers. Bills of exchange are also tight, and the market price plummeted by four or five taels. In the end, it reversed and went in a more moderate direction. Now, the situation in the forward and spot markets is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Forward Market Went Through Several Ups and Downs: It opened early in June at 740 taels and 5 qian, a small drop of 1.7 qian. Although the big bar staff rose by one-sixteenth and the silver price by one-eighth, the foothold was not good. The demand from Citibank was greater than the supply, and the market situation turned firm. Then Hongkang, Yongcheng, Fengyongheng, Yuzhifeng, Yongfuchang, Yuanheng, etc., felt that there was selling pressure, and the US dollar was also loosened, with the June closing at 30 yuan, 4375 to half a yuan. Therefore, it continued to fall by 4 taels, only 36 taels and a half. At times it rebounded by one tael, to 38 taels or so. The British gold posting did not change, and the US dollar added 25, because the exchange rate rose. Later, the domestic market seemed flat. Zhongfu and others absorbed 30 yuan, 3125 this month, and HSBC appeared, first ordering 6875, which was the settlement of British and American tobacco companies. Moreover, Yuankang, Xiangzhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongfuchang, Hongli, Yifengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, and Dacheng all traded in, causing the price to rise by 5 taels in one go, reaching 42 taels and 7 qian at 10:30. In a short while, Yiyu, Hengyu, and others sold off, depreciating by 3 taels. Near 11 o'clock, it was 39 taels and 8 qian. Then it rose by 3 taels again, which was due to Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, Hongxingyong, Richang and others buying in. In addition, a certain bank bought 245 spot bars, and Yingfeng Heng and others traded in futures. The US dollar in the near term could be bought and sold for 1875, and the far term could be sold for half a yuan. At 11:30, it was 42 taels and 6 qian. However, there was little change in half an hour. Fuyu, Hengyu, Dacheng and others continued to sell unremittingly, making it difficult to support, and it fell by more than 3 taels. At 11:45, it was 39 taels. By noon, it closed at 39 taels and a half, and then suppressed by more than 1 tael. The posted price was 807 taels, a difference of 70 taels to 65 taels. At noon, it was still 70 taels.</p>
<p>The Ending Returned to a Moderate Path: The afternoon market opened and fell by 3 taels, to 36 taels and a half, because it was heard that the war in Harbin was tight, and people's hearts became uneasy. Before long, there seemed to be more buyers. The US dollar bank had a good appetite. Mitsui and Zhongfu absorbed 6875 in August, and immediately rebounded by more than 2 taels, to 29 taels and 2 qian. After 2:30, a sudden storm arose. Hongkang, Yongyifeng, Yongwanxing, Qianchang, Xiangyuanmao, Yong and others sold off, because the US dollar in August was 75, and the near term could be closed for half a yuan, so the price plummeted by more than 3 taels. It was 35 taels and 6 qian until 4 o'clock. Then Hengyu, Hengxing, Yuanchun and others bought in. Although there were no large orders, the price was pulled up by more than 3 taels. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 38 taels and 7 qian, a drop of 3 taels and a half compared to the morning. However, goods came in, and it rose to 40 taels again. According to the biggest difference in one day, 42 taels and 7 qian, and the smallest 35 taels and 6 qian, there was a difference of 7 taels and 1 qian. The posted price was 70 taels in and out, registered at 40 taels, water replenishment at 40 taels, 39 taels in the afternoon, and red bars added 5 taels.</p>
<p>The Inflow and Outflow of Each Firm Was Complicated: In the table, the total transactions were Yuanyongmao, Shunli, and Qianchangxiang all traded in, and Fuyu, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuantai, Dacheng and others all traded out, with a lot of confusion. Yuhe, Hongkangyong, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, Yifengyong, and Zhaofengchang all traded out. In the afternoon, Yuanheng, Hengxing, Goods, and Shunli all traded in. Wanxing, Hongkangyong, Dacheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Qianchangxiang all traded out. Hengyu came out and then traded in again. The other firms were very complicated.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Securities Buying Sentiment Is Very Dull <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Bond Prices Fall By As Much As One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a large volume of spot sales of salt tax bonds, accounting for 29,000 yuan, followed by unified tax bonds at 10,000 yuan, demobilization bonds at 8,000 yuan, and other bonds at only 1,000 yuan each, totaling 52,000 yuan. The futures market was more deserted than before. The atmosphere of the market buyers and sellers was very dull. A total of 1.56 million was traded in the morning, and only more than 1 million in the afternoon, totaling 2.64 million. In addition to 20 customs rolls, unified salt tax bonds accounted for about 400,000 yuan each, and the rest were only more than 100,000 yuan. The various bonds tended to be weak due to the current situation and diplomatic situation. There was little vitality. The general public was slightly more pessimistic than before, so the buying momentum was very quiet, while individual sellers were still eager to sell. As a result, the prices of various bonds consistently weakened compared to before, falling step by step, with no sign of weakening. However, the ups and downs were still peaceful, and there were no major rises or falls in the forward and spot markets. As a result, only a few spot bonds rose slightly compared to the previous day, and futures such as the May period of 19 Customs Bonds fell by an average of one and a half yuan, and 20 Customs Unified Salt Tax fell by a small one yuan and two jiao, and the rest also fell by a small six or seven jiao. Judging from the situation in the bond market, it seems that it is not permissible to be too optimistic for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Amidst Conflicting Rumors About Cotton Yarn <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Yarn Market Is Experiencing a Major Decline</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak, and the decline is becoming more and more severe. The situation is extremely panicky. There are conflicting rumors, which are enough to make people uneasy. The stockpile of yarn in Shanghai is thick, and the goods from inland yarn factories are being transported to Shanghai one after another. In terms of prices, they are very willing to make concessions. However, it is still difficult to arouse the purchasing intentions of various gangs. The financial situation is tight, the current situation is unstable, and people's hearts are declining. However, the factories still have no intention of selling their inventory, so the market atmosphere can still be tightened a bit. However, outsiders see that the overall situation is undecided and unanimously tend to sell, so the market price is plummeting and has fallen another two taels and eight or nine qian. It is estimated that the 50 tael mark for the listed yarn may be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>The Price of the Listed Yarn for the Far Month Fell by Two Taels and Eight or Nine Qian: When the market opened for the listed yarn, although American cotton rose, the market was not in good spirits and lacked buyers, so there were very few transactions. The price of each month fell by 37 qian to one tael and five qian. The decline became more severe in the afternoon, and the rumors were even more intense. The price of each month fell by another one tael and nine qian to two taels and one qian. According to the daily statistics, the成交was 6,600 bales. It was found that Yuda sold 200 bales, Mingde 250 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Yuande 450 bales, and Yiyu 150 bales. Dafu bought 150 bales, Zhenda 250 bales, Gengfeng 250 bales, Dachangcheng 200 bales, Yichang 300 bales, and Yongda 150 bales. The closing price of the listed yarn is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Number of Accounts of the Listed Yarn at Closing Compared to the Previous Day: September 15.01, fell 2.915, 650. The price of the July period was 15.01, fell 1.4, 2,450. The price of October was 15.06, 2.817,500. The price of the August period was 15.01, fell 2.4, 14,200. Statistics …58,850</p>
<p>The Sales of Yarn Was 500 Bales: The spot yarn business was more than yesterday, but the market price still fell by one tael. According to the daily statistics, the various gangs bought a total of 500 bales. The guest gang and the northern gang bought 10 bales, the inland gang bought 40 bales, the Guangdong gang bought 100 bales, the Shantou gang bought 55 bales, the Ningbo gang bought 25 bales, the Changsha gang bought 15 bales, the Weihaiwei gang bought 190 bales, and the same industry gang bought 15 bales. Shenxin Factory still had scattered sales, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Lack of Entrants and Declining Transactions <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Market Shows Extreme Dispersion</p>
<p>The cotton market is still weak, but foreign cotton has risen slightly. However, the prices calculated for the silver plates are still cheap, so spot cotton transactions are sluggish. Various factories are depressed due to the downstream trend of the yarn market, so the popularity is flat. As a result, there are fewer buyers, and business in the market is scattered. Fortunately, the inventory of this cotton is low, and the market price is not as high as the yarn price, it is said.</p>
<p>The Price of the Zheng Biao Fell by Three or Four Qian: The opening situation of the Zheng Biao in the previous market was still weak, and there were very few transactions. The price of each month fell by 1 qian and 5 fen. In the afternoon, the price of each month fell by another 1 qian and 5 fen. It was found that Shenji sold 300 dan, Renfeng 700 dan, Xiesheng 300 dan, Ruida 1,200 dan, Changhe 400 dan, and Xincheng 400 dan. Dafu bought 200 dan, Shenchang 1,700 dan, Changfeng 500 dan, Dachang 300 dan, Xinheng 200 dan, and Yuanda 500 dan. The closing price of the Zheng Biao is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The Number of Accounts of the Zheng Biao at Closing Compared to the Previous Day: The price of the October period was 31.85, fell .445,800. The price of the July period was 32.10, fell 2.317,000.…8,100. The price of the August period was 22.05, 340,600.</p>

<p>The Xihe flower market in Tianjin is flat and stagnant, but the factory's activities are not weak. The Japanese merchant situation is stagnant, and the market atmosphere is not showing any changes because there is no huge development. Huaxin Yarn Factory bought 310 bales of Xihe flower, with a price of 27 taels and 5 qian. Yuyuan Factory also bought 300 bales of Xih American cotton, with a price of 28 taels and 8 qian, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Overseas Cotton Markets Are Consistently Lower <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to the pressure from sellers and the slump on Wall Street. Later, it was firm due to some short covering. Futures fell by 8 to 13 pound notes, and spot fell by 10 pound notes. British cotton futures fell by 12 to 14 points, and spot fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to bad news from Liverpool. Pingguoer fell by 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th telegram):</p>

<p>Heavy Rain and Stifling Heat... Silkworm Disease Spreads</p>
<p>Huzhou and Nanxun have always been famous silk areas. The silk from 輯里is sold well in Europe and America. Eighty to ninety percent of farmers are engaged in sericulture. In recent years, sericulture has been unsuccessful. This year, the silk and tea industries have both failed, and the rural economy has declined. There is nowhere to borrow silkworm capital, and very few people are raising silkworms, and the feeding amount is only about thirty to forty percent. However, they are all hatching foreign breeds, and the development after the receipt of the ants is still good. However, during the second eye, there were continuous cloudy and rainy days, and the cold and warm temperatures were abnormal, and silkworm diseases were everywhere. In the past two days, due to thunderstorms and stifling heat, silkworm diseases have spread everywhere, and there are many who have abandoned their silkworms. The silkworm harvest this year is also disappointing, and the silkworm farmers are very discouraged, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in the foreign firms in this port was still at a standstill. The overseas factory prices were still very different from the costs of the Chinese silk merchants. The Japanese silk opening prices were surprisingly low, and the Chinese silk still had a market without a transaction. The European and American silk telegrams did not turn around yesterday, and the market atmosphere was stagnant. It is really impossible for silk sales to turn around, it is said.</p>

<p>Qimen black tea has started to be picked and made for nearly a week. Recently, because of the good weather, the late tea in Zhou Shan has also revealed silver spears. The tea farmers in various mountains have successively opened the gardens, because the solar term has arrived. In the past two days, due to light rain and more sunny days, the tea body has been soaked in rain and dew, and the quality and taste have become thicker. It is very conducive to drying the embryos in the sun, and the shipments are quite good. The tea firms in the villages of Qimen Southwest and Fuliang have successively sent staff to weigh the tea and set up branches to search for and buy tea. Although the mountain price is slightly higher than before, the merchants are competing to advance because the tea stored in Shanghai this year has been sold out and there is no stagnation. They are rushing to box and transport the tea to Shanghai, hoping to get a new price. However, the weather is still cold, and the tea buds are not growing long. The tea farmers regret that the buds are too tender and are afraid that the harvest will be deficient, so they are mostly reluctant to pick and make as much as possible, and take their time to pick. Therefore, although new tea is on the market, shipments are not very active. Furthermore, the most difficult thing for the merchants at present is that it is not easy to transport cash. The reason is that there are more than a hundred miles between Jingde and Tunxi and Qifu. Robbers are rampant along the way. Although Jingzhen's cash is said to be sufficient and the foreign cents have been reduced, the merchants are afraid of transporting cash from afar in order to protect their capital. Even if there is picking and transportation, it will be difficult to manage in every possible way, which is very difficult. Therefore, up to now, all the cash of the various tea firms is not enough to handle the second batch of tea. It is not known whether the tea price, which is extremely high, will fall immediately due to the lack of cash.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Tunchi Tea Firms Suddenly Increase <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>More than eighty firms in the entire city</p>
<p>Have been leased entirely without exception</p>
<p>The tea market in Tunchi has always been known for its prosperity. In recent years, the selling price of various teas has often been higher than that of Wu (婺). At the beginning of this year, due to the impact of the Shanghai Incident, the money supply was severely restricted, and very few tea firms prepared to open. After the Shanghai market reopened, financial institutions were able to provide some flexibility and assistance to tea merchants, and the market situation improved rapidly. In addition, Tunchi's money houses, recognizing that local tea firms were generally stable and cautious in their operations, also provided substantial loans to maintain their operations. As a result, almost all firms in Xiutun have been actively planning to open in the past month. More than eighty firms in the entire city have been leased without exception. Furthermore, there are still more than ten new firms in the process of being established. However, before this ten-day period, bank drafts (申票) could be sold for 1,400 yuan per thousand taels of silver. Recently, due to the robbery at the Bank of China, all firms are guarding their cash reserves with caution, and the exchange rate has also risen compared to the previous ten-day period, with only 1,380 yuan being paid per thousand taels of silver. Tea merchants are indirectly affected considerably.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Grain and Rice Market Strengthens Slightly Due to Rain <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the rice market's inland sources included seven ships from Wuxi, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiaoli, Fengjing, etc. Due to heavy rain in the morning, sales were suspended. By the afternoon, the weather had cleared, and six firms, including Hongsheng, Wanxing, Jiutai, Tongxing, Yishun, and Yuanchang, sold nearly a thousand piculs of early and late indica rice, with prices rising by one or two jiao compared to previous offers.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, continuous rain resulted in fewer people visiting the market in the morning, and the supply of goods gradually decreased. Furthermore, it was reported that the South Shanghai market suddenly increased prices, and trading interest was also weak. Due to the difficulty of transporting goods from the producing areas, thick indica rice rose by two jiao. The supply of thin indica rice was relatively scarce. A dozen or so firms along the river and rural merchants provided some support, leading to a price increase of about one jiao. Imported Du-brand pointed rice was selling steadily, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Imported Rice Sales Are Strong <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Jiangbei counties are requesting Shanghai to purchase imported rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market saw more active trading. In addition to merchants from Hankou actively buying, households from Chongming and Tongzhou in Jiangbei also made active purchases in the market. This was because the area had suffered from floods and famine last year, and their rice reserves had been almost exhausted. As a result, the local county governments issued a batch of permits, instructing rice merchants to purchase rice in Shanghai to provide relief. Currently, these permits have been approved by the Jianghai Customs and the Social Affairs Bureau for release. Only a portion of the permits still need to go through procedures before they can be transported. Once these merchants start buying, the market will see a significant improvement. However, two ships of imported rice arrived yesterday and today, and rice merchants were unwilling to raise prices sharply. Therefore, the selling prices remained largely unchanged from the previous day. Small-grain rice was offered at 7,000 bags, priced at 10.30 yuan to 10.0156 yuan. Mindang rice was offered at 200 bags, priced at 10.45 yuan. Rice from the Malay Archipelago was offered at 2,000 bags, priced at 10.48 yuan to 10.50 yuan. Keladi brown rice was offered at more than 2,000 bags, priced at 9.70 yuan to 9.60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Flour Sales Are Extremely Sluggish <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of imported wheat rose by one or two jiao. However, the sales of flour were sluggish. No actual sales customers from any region made inquiries. Even major merchants and wholesalers in the market did not inquire. Only scattered retailers with speculative intentions made small purchases, and there was no real outlet for the goods. Therefore, the opening market price was low, and there was no sign of improvement after the price decline. Spot goods of naval vessel brands closed at 2.045 yuan per two (兩). The price for May was quoted at 2.06 yuan, but the lowest price was 2.0425 yuan. The closing price settled slightly at 2.0475 yuan, which was 0.0175 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Oil Market: Production of Tung Oil in Hongjiang Is Severely Restricted <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The spring season is usually a peak season for tung oil from Hongjiang. However, this year, the Shanghai Incident occurred, causing the market to be closed for two months, which prevented development. Since the market reopened, there has been no movement. However, the military situation in the interior has not been completely resolved, so it has not been able to return to its original state. Generally speaking, it will only prosper and become smooth after the money supply is circulating. Now that the battles on both sides are about to end, the revival of commerce can be expected. Firms in this port are preparing to re-energize themselves and find ways to promote their business. However, it is reported that the oil presses in the producing areas have greatly reduced production in light of the military situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. According to their total production, it is less than half of what it was in previous years. If this is true, then a reduction in supply is inevitable. Fortunately, sales are also not as strong as in previous years, which can be said with certainty. Even if spring sales are combined with summer sales, it is expected that there will not be a severe shortage. Currently, the selling price of the genuine Jichanghe brand is 23 taels, Jiyingfeng is 21 taels and 67 qian, the sub-brand Qingyuanfeng is 18 taels and 2 qian, Yanghengyuan is 18 taels and 4 qian, Xiangtaifeng Jifengying is 17 taels and 8 qian, and Liutongqing is 17 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Summer Cloth with Patterned Designs Has Healthier Sales <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the cloth market has stabilized. There have been no significant changes in coarse cloth and fine cloth. However, fine twill has been affected by the covert activities of Japanese manufacturers, resulting in extremely quiet sales. Dyeing factories for coarse twill have made some purchases, and sales of lower-grade goods have been relatively smooth. Yesterday, 25 pieces were traded. Three Fish brand was priced at 5 taels and 1 qian, Three Rabbit brand was priced at 5 taels and 05 fen, and Cat Eagle brand was priced at 4 taels, 9 qian, and 7.5 fen. Spot goods of nine-pound coarse cloth are gradually becoming scarce. The Zhong brand of Three Chickens and Treasure Basin factory quoted a forward price of 4 taels and 3 qian, so sentiment has hardened. Blue striped calico has been difficult to revitalize due to the proliferation of miscellaneous brands. Yesterday, Five Blessings was still 8 taels, and Scholar Diagram was 7 taels and 8.5 qian. The patterned goods of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company have been purchased by local and visiting merchants in recent days. Patterned Ting was priced at 2 qian and 1 fen, patterned linen yarn was priced at 2 qian and 1.5 fen, miscellaneous plain western yarn was priced at 9 taels, colored Zigong was priced at 2 qian and 2.5 fen, soft light twill was priced at 5 taels and 2.5 qian, patterned Fuchou was priced at 3 qian and 6 fen, patterned cloth had a lowest price of 4 taels and 5 qian and a highest price of 4 taels and 8.5 qian. Lun Chang goods of patterned cloth suffered a severe price decline. Light colors were only 4 taels and 4.5 qian, yarn serge was 2 qian and 4.5 fen, and deep color Ting was 2 qian and 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Sichuan Merchants Continue to Trade in Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market remained unchanged. Prices continued to decline as before. There were more retail transactions than wholesale transactions. Yesterday, large and small Sichuan merchants such as Fuyu Gong, Dachuan Tong, Yiji Zhan, Taigu Yu, and Yihe Yu continued to trade. There were letters requesting the purchase of Yuanchang blue-gray plain serge, feather yarn, Baltic fabric, various chocolate Ting, and Walter fabric. The guild opened a total of 30 to 40 cases throughout the city. At a time when the market is depressed, such strong demand adds a lot of color to the market's prospects.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Metal Trading Becomes Quieter Due to Rain <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Visiting merchants suspend purchases due to inconvenient transportation</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to continuous rain, metal trading became quieter. Visiting merchants and factories suspended purchases due to inconvenient transportation, so the market was unusually deserted. Fortunately, sentiment remained good, so market standards were maintained. Yesterday, tinplate was offered at 600 to 700 cases, priced at 10 taels. 4-fen and 5-fen nails were sold at 50 barrels, priced at 13 taels and 12 taels and 7.5 qian. Yesterday, there were only inquiries about lead and tin, and few transactions were made. The market price for lead was 13 taels and 7.5 qian. Tin was offered at 95 taels. Yesterday, foreign firms' business in pure antimony was booming again, and the market seemed to be turning upward, so it was offered at 215 taels. There were reports of 50 tons being traded, and negotiations are still ongoing.</p>

<p>— Shen Zheyue</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Jinzhi, the president of the Zhapu Literary and Art Mutual Aid Society,</p>
<p>With the determination to resist Japan and save the country, he resolutely abandoned his writing tools the day before yesterday and joined the Zhapu garrison to work on resisting Japan. He is the first young man in Zhapu to exchange the pen for the sword.</p>
<p>One day I saw many farmers happily helping the army dig trenches. While working, they sang, "Turn over our field soil to dig trenches, overthrow the tyrannical Japanese invaders." The soldiers listened and applauded.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Gleanings of Humiliation Suffered by Compatriots <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday I met a gentleman who had gone to Zhabei to move household goods.</p>
<p>He recounted the humiliation suffered by our compatriots along the way. It was infuriating. Alas, our country has not yet fallen, but we are already suffering the pain of being slaves of a fallen nation. If we continue to delay and the country falls, the suffering will be even more unbearable. Therefore, I have recorded the following from what this gentleman said, to express my sorrow and to hope that our compatriots will not go to Zhabei again before it is recovered, so as to avoid suffering. (1) About a hundred paces north of Han Bridge, there was a young man of about thirty, wearing a silk robe and woolen jacket, looking very neat. Unexpectedly, the enemy ordered him to hold a lump of coal, weighing about dozens of pounds, in both hands and stand upright on the side of the road. He was not allowed to move, so that sweat poured down his forehead. (2) On Zhongxing Road, I saw a man prostrate on the ground. Three or four enemy soldiers stood around him. First, they ordered him to raise his head and bark like a dog. Then they forced him to crawl on the street. One soldier chased after him. If he moved slowly, they would hit him with the butt of a gun, then throw leftover food on the side of the road and force him to crawl over and eat it. (3) A man was made to hold a burning piece of wood in each hand. He had to stretch his left hand straight forward and raise his right hand high. His face was smeared with black coal and mud. Standing in a rubble field, he looked like the Black Impermanence ghost enshrined in the City God Temple from a distance. (4) Paper masks were cut out and placed on the heads of children about ten years old. They were ordered to act like monkeys, jumping around incessantly. They were also forced to climb telegraph poles. They climbed and fell again and again. The children were exhausted and hoarse, and the enemy soldiers all clapped and laughed. (5) A worker bought a bundle of pickled vegetables in the market, intending to cook them at home. When he passed a post, he was afraid of their power and tried to avoid them. They caught sight of him and dragged him back. He was forced to kneel for an hour, and then they made him put the bundle of pickled vegetables on his head, so that the vegetable juice dripped all over his body. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry. (6) A fat teenager was slapped in the face four or five times by soldiers to test how crisp the sound was. When he was slapped, he was not allowed to turn his head, and he had to look them straight in the eyes. Otherwise, they would kick and punch him.</p>

<p>— Kaixu</p>
<p>The recent French general election did not have any major political upheavals that would attract our attention. However, even small news snippets can be used as a lesson for us to learn from and be moved by. There is a city in France called Pyrénées, located in the mountains, with layered peaks and very inconvenient transportation. They have repeatedly petitioned the French Ministry of Transport to improve the mountain roads and install telephones to facilitate transportation. As a result, the authorities did not adopt their requests. In this general election, all the people of Pyrénées unanimously decided to refuse to participate in order to show their resistance, which aroused national sympathy. As a result, on the first vote on May 1, no one in Pyrénées went out to vote. The French Ministry of Transport had no choice but to send someone to mediate and allow all their requests. Therefore, the people of the city have agreed to unanimously participate in the second vote on May 8. I have learned many lessons from this. First, the city's public opinion was unified and its actions were uniform. No one dared to defy public opinion and undermine it. Thus, it can be seen that the people of France are not as weak as the people of our country, and can be freely controlled by the authorities. Second, the government authorities can create benefits for the people and do not arbitrarily act alone. They follow good advice and do not become angry and arrogant, or go against the tide. Comparing them to us, how does the French Ministry of Transport compare to our country's Ministry of Transport? If a small town with rugged mountain roads does not even have postal services, how can it be willing to spend national funds urgently needed for military supplies to create benefits for the people of a small town?</p>

<p>Sword Grinding Records</p>
<h3 id="e146">Pockmarked Liu <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>During the Battle of Shanghai, the 19th Route Army bravely resisted the Japanese. Although they were threatened by enemy aircraft and artillery, and by the large number of naval, land, and air forces, they were able to fight bloody battles for more than a month and repeatedly defeat the strong enemy. It is appropriate that foreigners should be respectful and admiring of them. Among the brave soldiers, foreign countries particularly praised the machine gun master Chen and the gunner Lao Zhang. But Pockmarked Liu, who was in the Big Sword Team, was also one of them, though his name was not well-known. Pockmarked Liu was named because his face had many spots. He was good at wielding the big sword, and was incomparably strong. When he was killing the enemy in Zhabei, he and his comrades first engaged in hand-to-hand combat and rushed into Dixiwei Road. Wherever the blade flashed, blood rained down. Many Japanese marines died under his blade. Therefore, his bravery was well-known. After the battle, he rested and liked to smoke a light pipe and talk and laugh. He said that he had pledged himself to the country and was fighting for justice, vowing to kill the Japanese invaders. He did not want to return alive. Later, the Japanese came to charge with tanks. Pockmarked Liu hung several bombs on his body and took the lead in engaging the enemy. He died in battle, but he destroyed an enemy tank with a bomb. Therefore, the enemy could not take advantage of his might. Zhang, from Dachang, fled to Shanghai and spoke freely about the Battle of Shanghai. That is what he told me. Alas, such as Pockmarked Liu, though dead, are still glorious. His courage is even greater than the ancient Ben Yu.</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Pitiable Dream Night Forced into an Alliance Under the Bed, Still Remembering the First Time on the Mountain When She Carried Out the Window Agreement</p>
<p>If fortune favors me, I can set sail directly. I will become a rich and powerful man. Then I will keep a beauty in a golden house. It may not be inappropriate to wrong such a famous courtesan who has once dabbled in the world as a concubine. Thinking so bitterly, I still concluded on the focal point of seeking a way out. I suddenly remembered that Liang Xiaoyun had just planned for me. She has other shortcuts to go through. I couldn't help but want to ask more. I reached out and shook her fragrant shoulder, saying, "Sorry, I still want to disturb you. Because I've been feeling confused these days, I'm eager to find a way out. I heard you say that you have a way to get to Military Governor Ye Zuozhang's place. How should we proceed? Why don't we study it?" But Liang Xiaoyun's mentality was different at this time. Although she had intended to be with An Yutian for a long time, she was cautiously hesitant and did not act lightly. Because she has deep thoughts, she saw clearly that An Yutian is a young man with high ambitions and pride. It was not her intention to hook up with him casually. If she wanted to completely subdue him, with the condition that his love be undivided and never betrayed, she was afraid that he would be like a wild horse and would never submit to restraint. Now that she had this good opportunity to take advantage of his predicament and make him willing to swim up to take the bait, it could be said that the heavens had arranged it cleverly. She had already steadily caught and fished him. How could she not be leisurely and at ease? She just smiled slightly and said, "What's the rush? Since I said there is a way, I will naturally have confidence. There is nothing to study more." After saying that, she turned over and reached out to the tea table by the bed. She took a cigarette, lit it, took two puffs, and then turned around and handed it to An Yutian. He waved his hand, indicating that he didn't want it. She didn't force him anymore, just looked up at the sky and smoked alone, spitting out a series of circular clouds one by one, humorously appreciating herself. An Yutian curled up beside her, but did not have her elegance and leisure. After being hit with a soft nail, it was inconvenient to ask any more questions. Helpless, he felt very depressed in his heart and couldn't help but sigh deeply. Liang Xiaoyun heard it, and casually threw the half-smoked cigarette into the spittoon under the bed. With a "hiss" sound, it went out. Then, with a "puff" of laughter, she turned her face and said, "Are you really eager to study it? Okay. At this moment, I also suddenly remembered an important question that I need to discuss with you. For example, if I go to Military Governor Ye's fifth wife to lobby for you, if people ask what relationship you and I have, what should I say?" An Yutian was stunned for a moment, and stammered, "You can do whatever you think is best."</p>

<p>Rui</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw in the newspaper two things, these things, in an evil society, especially Shanghai, can often be seen, everywhere can be seen, what I am saying today, is just using one example.</p>
<p>(1) Because the waist of Yang Xingying's cheongsam was too wide, a quarrel broke out between mother and daughter, and in a fit of pique, she threw herself into the river, and was rescued by a boat attendant, and lost her virginity.</p>
<p>(2) In the case of the Qi Rengxi family dispute, Qi usually indulged in extravagance and spent money like water. The sisters competed with each other to show off, resulting in a tragic end, and the result was so, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>I ask (1) what does it matter if the waist of the cheongsam is a little too wide, to the point of throwing oneself into the river and committing suicide. (2) A family that squanders money like this cannot avoid a disastrous day, these sins are all created by society, I can say that these two people are two representatives of the current society, like this, there are countless.</p>
<p>Since the Xinhai Revolution, everywhere has followed the example of Europe and the United States, and in recent days, this trend has become even worse. Originally, since the opening of the five treaty ports, the gate has long been broken, and it is naturally impossible to maintain a closed-door policy, but in following the example of Europe and the United States, one should follow the good points of Europe and the United States, and not the bad points of Europe and the United States. Now the good points of Europe and the United States, some have never been learned, and the bad points of Europe and the United States, it can be said that everything can be done.</p>
<p>For example, the representative system, which has been practiced in Europe and the United States for many years, cannot be said to be absolutely free of drawbacks, but it is generally a good system with more advantages than disadvantages. When it comes to our country, it is subcontracting, bribery, appointment, coercion, and the occurrence of various bad phenomena. As for modern women, they like to dance, watch movies, fold their chests and sway their clothes, and look strange and grotesque, flaunting themselves in the streets. Men wear suits and leather shoes, talk about freedom, talk about love, talk about Europeanization, and dress up beautifully, these are their life goals.</p>
<p>Therefore, the life of young children is very high, and the ability to produce has no foundation, they look forward to the occasional opportunity every day, and the arrival of good luck, one day they are successful, they can live in a western-style house, take a car, boast about their wives and concubines, and various delusions linger in their minds and cannot go away, and if they are unsuccessful, they are frustrated and bored, depressed and unsuccessful, the so-called "a fool looking up at the sky falling, a poor man looking forward to the people rebelling", and looking back at the old-fashioned family, like a beast trapped in a cage, and a prison prisoner a thug, so the right path is not followed, and many people run on the wrong path.</p>
<p>A good government must first have a good society, and a good society must have a good government to promote it. Now the national treasury is like washing, and the extravagance and licentiousness of the wind is rampant, the national productivity is almost equal to zero, and the westernization is imitated without the slightest detail, the country is in great trouble, and the social phenomenon is like this, what else can be said? What else can be said?</p>

<p>The drums of Liaoyang sound loudly, but the foolish dreamer has not awakened. Dance shadows are spinning, leaning on green and cuddling red, wantonly indulging in revelry.

<p>— Zhu Yunzong</p>
<p>With eyes strained, I see the Central Plains deeply ill. Why don't the pillars of state care? It is worrisome that the beautiful rivers and mountains will continue to sink into the abyss.</p>
<p>Worries and hardships are rife, but who is the matchmaker? The secret plans of the court are not made public. The people are suffering and the golden goblet is broken. We do not see the blue sky and white sun.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3 id="e152">Vitamins <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Ji</p>
<p>The term "vitamins" can often be found in modern books, but what exactly are they? I'm afraid many people are still a bit confused. Vitamins are mysterious, invisible, and odorless substances contained in food. They are indispensable in our daily lives, because without them, we will be weak, sick, and even die.</p>
<p>According to scientists, there are now seven types of vitamins, but in terms of actual use, there are only six. They each have their own special functions and cannot be substituted for one another. Therefore, it is not appropriate to eat only one type of food, even if it provides a certain vitamin but lacks other vitamins.</p>
<p>Many inexplicable facts from the past have now broken through the mystery and found their causes due to the discovery of vitamins. For example, navigators and sailors often suffered from "scurvy." In the past, no one knew the source of the disease, but now it is known that it is caused by a lack of vitamin C. This vitamin is contained in fresh fruits and vegetables. It is difficult to obtain fresh fruits and vegetables at sea, so a lack of vitamin C leads to "scurvy."</p>
<p>Now, their functions and sources will be explained in order below:</p>

<h3 id="e153">It Scared Me! <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>On a Sunday afternoon, the people at ○○○ Road were in a chaotic hubbub, and I was lingering in front of the ○○○ store.</p>
<p>I saw an old beggar squatting slightly, saying, "Sirs! Madams! Give me a few cents to buy a bowl of congee! I am not lazy and became a beggar, my home… has been bombed by artillery fire…". The sound of his cry was sadder and more miserable than the last, trying to get a considerable price with this sound wave. He shouted himself hoarse, but he still had not received a penny. Suddenly, a group of female students came, and he opened his mouth to say, "Miss…". You old fool! It scared me! The beggar sneered and said, "If I were a minister, a director, a doctor, or a master, you might not dislike me for being old, and you would sing praises in front of me."</p>
<p>After hearing this, I came back and thought about it. Why are the sacred female students only focused on vanity and power! This old beggar was really hit by this."</p>

<p>— Yu Xian</p>
<p>In this false and hypocritical universe, the ramblings of a dream might have some value, so I write random jottings in a dream.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Ziping wrote "Daughter of the Weaver Girl", he dares not walk on North Szechuan Road. Now, North Szechuan Road dares not have Zhang Ziping walk on it.</p>
<p>I myself cannot eat even a pint of rice a day, busy leaving home in the morning, busy returning at night, for whom do I toil, for whom do I busy myself?</p>
<p>"The way out for unemployed workers after the war," a certain newspaper used extra-large characters to publish such an advertisement, "To know the details, enclose one cent for postage, and it will be sent immediately."</p>
<p>The thing that was sent had two large characters written on it: "Suicide". "Officially signed, held yesterday." Someone (or a ghost) had already told me this in a dream a few days ago.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I saw someone lightly say the three words "×× Lane," and the rickshaw puller would obediently pull to ×× Lane on Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Madman Ah San said: "Guo Taiqi was beaten again. There is really no place to eat in China. I want to go abroad."</p>
<p>The chauffeur wishes there were no pedestrians on the road; the pedestrian wishes there were no cars on the road.</p>
<p>I dreamed of a large bomb, and then I woke up.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>In Mr. Bai Tao's article ("Who is the Traitor"), it says ("Who exactly is the traitor who signed the treaty of national betrayal? It is none other than Lu Zengxiang, one of the notorious trio of national traitors, Cao, Lu, and Zhang.")</p>
<p>Mr. Bai Tao has misremembered. The Lu in the notorious trio of national traitors, Cao, Lu, and Zhang, is Lu Zongyu, courtesy name Runsheng, from Haining, Zhejiang, not Lu Zengxiang. Everyone knows this. As for whether Lu Zengxiang was a co-signer of the Twenty-One Demands, I do not know, so I dare not make a definitive statement, because the Northern Government did not clearly announce it at the time. Wang Jingwei mistakenly identified Xiong Xiling as a co-signer, probably for the same reason?</p>
<p>It is also said ("Lu Zengxiang, because he signed the treaty of national betrayal, regretted it too late, and now abandoned his family and became a monk abroad.") As far as I know, Lu Zengxiang's motive for becoming a monk abroad was to fulfill the dying wish of his foreign wife "a Belgian woman", and probably not because he regretted it too late? The dying wish of his Belgian wife was published in Shanghai newspapers before. (To be continued)</p>
