<h3>國聨調查團報告書之價值上·梓</h3>
<p>國聨調查團六　月調查之結果。能使我含憤忍辱之中國人民。得如何之安慰乎。抑更增加其情緒之剌戟乎。此一問題。因調查報告之正式發表。巳有正確之答案。給與吾人矣。</p>
<p>國人倘認此項報告書之所陳述。有使中國立於失敗地位之危機者。則當知調查團派遣之時不使監視日本之踐諾撤兵。乃使研究任何足以影響國際關係。而有擾亂中日两國和平所維繫之諒解之虞之情形。中國之於此項調查。蓋巳有先天的失敗危機之豫伏矣。回億去年十二月國聨决議案發表之時。國内與論。顯分两派。甲爲積極反對者。主張監决拒絶。乙爲欲藉以傅達日本舉行於世界者。主張循禮招待。用作宣傅途徑。其後李頓爵士等五委員負國聨艱巨之使命東來。滬戰雖停。日勢猶盛。中國政府與人民。乃依上述乙派之主張。優禮欵待。冀盡宣傅之能事。然李頓爵士於三月二十八日。在行政院長汪精衛招待席上。曾明確表示「國聨决不能帮助一會員國。而損害其他一會員國」。此巳無異以今日之結果。豫示於吾人矣。因是吾人倘非曾對調查團作過分之奢望者今日亦不必爲過分之失望。去年十二月國聨决議案進行時。有勸慰中國代表者。謂國聨之所準備。巳屬現狀下所能提出之最好解决方案。今李頓爵士等又以彼等心目中所能提出之最好解决方案。呈</p>
<h3>國聨調查團報告書</h3>
<p>｜昨外交部在京滬平漢同時公表｜</p>
<p>報告書結晶在第九十两章</p>
<p>一方保留中國政府有政治主權</p>
<p>一方承認是本有實在經濟利益</p>
<p>一方不主張恢復九一八前舊狀</p>
<p>一方亦不主張維持僞滿洲組織</p>
<p>建議中日召集一顧問會議</p>
<p>由中國政府發表一種宣言</p>
<p>訂立中日和解條約商約等</p>
<p>准許東三省建設自治政府</p>
<p>以特殊憲兵維持地方治安</p>
<p>並用外國顧問以共同治理</p>
<p>國聨調查團報告書、於本年九月間在北平製成、内容包含下列各項、（一）緒言、</p>
<p>（二）正文、共分十章、（三）附錄、載入各項問題之特殊研究、（四）附件、載入調查團經過途程之詳圖、及其所訪問之人員及機關、並由國政府送致調查團參考之各項文件、</p>
<p>緒言述國際聨合會派遣調查團之經過、調查團所負之使命、及調查團所經歷之途程、</p>
<p>正文第一第二及第三章、述中日衝突之歷史背境、内第一章述近年中國發展之概况、第二章述滿洲概况、及其與中國其餘部分及俄國之關係、第三章述一九三一年九月十八日以前中日間之滿洲　案、第四章方叙述九八事變及九一八以後日本在東三省之軍事行動、並調查團考察九一八事變所得之結論、第五章述上海事件、第六章述「滿洲國」、分爲三部分、（一）「新國」造成之經過（二）「滿洲國」之現政府、（三）東三省居民對於「新國」之態度、第七諸國聨矣。李頓爵士等於報告書第十章。用「如爭議　　定接受　於此種原則之解决方法時儘有修正之餘地」之字句。其反面顯有爭議　不願接受之餘地。而報告書之眞正的價值。換言之。即其可以實現其建議之程度者。於此可見。</p>
<p>調查報告之使命。第一爲審查中日間之爭議。吾人細讀報告書全文。於前八章見其對於中日爭議之審查。如第四章述九一八事變。謂「是晚日方之軍事行動。不能視爲合法自衛之辦法。」第六章述僞組織之成立。爲「一　日本文武官吏現任與退職者均有。圖謀組織並實施此項運動以爲解决九月十八日以後滿洲局面之辦法。」認定「現在之政權不能認爲由眞正及自然之獨立運動所産生。」謂「此所關滿洲國政府者。在當地華人心目中眞是日人之工具而巳。」此種公正之審查。使吾人對於調查團。不得不佩服其目光之銳利與態度之確當倘使其能不爲被派遣時决議案中之文句所牽累。即就此依國際公理國際公法約而定正確之解决方案者。則其解决方案。當較現在之所建議。更能有裨於實際。此可斷言。者惟其必欲於「擾亂中日两國和平維擊之諒解」等方面强求材料、故於第三章追述中日舊有爭執。第七章述日人之經濟利益與華人之經濟絶交反致使眞實明確之認識爲此性質複雜之數章所障蔽結果。反使世人對於調查團之審查。　其認識不足。此吾人於評定報告書價值之時。所不能不爲之扼腕者也。</p>
<p>報告書最後两章。述解决爭案之原則及條件。並向國聨行政院提出建議。　　問題　雜。非此短篇所能罄容於明日續論之、。</p>
<p>章述日本在華之經濟利益及中國之排貨運動、第八章述滿洲之經濟利益、尤注意於日本在滿洲之利益、第九章述解决之原則及條件、第十章述調查團向國際聨合會行政院提出之意見及建議、</p>
<p>今日外部所發表者、係　譯緒言與正文、惟正文第九十两章爲報告書之全部結晶、關係重要、故照譯全文發表、編者附　中日爭議調查團報告書、係於一九三二年九月四日在北平簽字、除緒言外、計分十章、對於種種問題之特殊研究、均載入報告書附件内、此外尙有一附錄、載明該團所取之行程·所會見之人物姓名表·及中日雙方所提交該團之文件、此項附錄·及關於特殊研究之附件、容後公布、</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>緒言首述中國因一九三一年九月十八日潘陽事件發生、而將中日爭議提交國聨行政院時（中國之要求、係於一九三一年九月二十一日、依國聨盟約第十一條提出、）之情形、國聨所採之行動、及依一九三一年二月十日之决議、指派調查團、該調查團由左列各員組成之、</p>
<p>馬柯迪伯爵美）、</p>
<p>克勞特將軍（法）、</p>
<p>李頓爵士（英）、</p>
<p>麥考益少將（美）、</p>
<p>希尼博士（德）、</p>
<p>在一九三二年二月三日、該調查團啓程經由美國來遠東之前、曾在日内瓦舉行两次集會、並經一致選舉李頓爵士爲調查團主席、嗣經日本政府及中國政府、指定參與代表如左、</p>
<p>中國前國務總理前外交部長廳維鈞、</p>
<p>日本駐土耳其大使吉田、</p>
<p>國聨秘書廳股長哈斯、嗣被任爲調查團之秘書長、在調查團進行工作之時、並有各專門家供其顧問、在該調查團啓行之前數日、中國政府曾於一月二十九日、依照國聨盟約第十條第十一條及第十五條提出更進一步之要求、及於一九三二年二月十二日請求行政院依國聨盟約第十五條第九項之規定、將中日間之爭議、提出國聨大會討論、自此以後、該調查團即未從行政院得有任何訓令、故仍本十二月十日之行政院决議、解釋其本身之任務如左、</p>
<p>（一）審查中日間之爭議、（包括此項爭議之原因發展、及在調查時之危機者則當（二）考慮中日爭議之可能的解决辦法、（務須對於两國之根本利益予以調和、）調查團對於其自身使命所具之概念、調查團工作、及旅程之綱領、以及報告書之計劃、均决於該團對於其自身使命所具之概念、其概念如次、</p>
<p>（一）中日两國在滿洲之權益、實爲此次爭議之根本原因、該團對於此項權益、曾加以叙述、以作此次爭議之歷史背景、</p>
<p>（二）對於爭議發生前最近發生之特殊爭端、加以考察、并對一九三一年九月十八日以後事件進展之情况、加以叙述、在研究此項爭議之過程中、該團聲明對於以往行動之責任、堅持較輕、而對於尋求防止將來再發生此項行動之方法、堅持較重、（三）最後該團對於各項爭執點、加以考慮、並依據該團認爲足以永久解决此交衝突、并恢復中日間好感之原則、提出建議數條、而報告書即告結束、</p>
<p>旅程在未達滿洲以前該團曾與中日两國政府及代表各方意見之人物發生接觸、以求確定各方利益之性質、該團於二月二十九日行抵東京、三月十四日至二十六日停留於上海、三月十六日至四月一日在南京、再在中國續行於四月九日抵北平、然後前放往滿洲、在該地勾留至六月四日、歴時六週、中間曾巡視該地各重要城市、最後調查團於六七两月中、再度赴北平東京各一次、後即七月二十日留居北平、而在該地從事於報告書之起草、</p>
<p>現時爭執之背景第一第二第三章、說明九一八瀋陽事變之發生、乃歷年輕微衝突之結局、足以顯出中日關係日趨緊張、如欲澈底了解两國間最近爭議之眞相、必須肯瞭最近两國間之關係、例如中國民氣之發達、日本帝國及舊俄帝國之拓展政策、最近蘇聨共産主義之廣播、中·日·蘇·三國經濟及國防策略上之需要、凡此諸端、皆認爲研究滿洲問題之重要事實、九一八以前、中日两國在滿洲之苦干主要交涉亦有叙述之必要、蓋必如此、然後可以確定滿洲何以成爲爭議之焦點、以及將來彼此爭議平息、雙方根本利益、如何能眞正調和、爲求此項爭議永久解决起見、何種問題值得研究、</p>
<h3>第一章中國近年發展之述要</h3>
<p>支配中國之重要原素、即爲中國自身徐徐之進行之近代化、今日之中國、乃係一正在演進之國家、其國家之一切生活、均在在顯出一過渡之現象、政治上之波瀾、内戰、社會及經濟上之不安、以及其相緣而生之中央政府之脆弱、均係爲一九一一年革命以來、中國之特殊現象、凡此種種情形、均足使彼與中國發生接觸之各國、蒙受不利之影響、而於其攺善以前、又必將繼續威脅世界之和平、以構成世界經濟不景氣之一原因、本章將釀成此種種現象之過程、簡單申述、如滿清之推翻、民國首數年之情狀、一九一四一九二八年間之内戰與政潮、孫中山先生之組織國民黨、一九二七年南京中央政府之成立、中央政府與其反對分子之競爭、共産主義在華之發展、以及中央政府在中國南部、與其黨組織之衝突、均有簡要之陳述、</p>
<p>由該項簡要之陳述以觀、即可知分離力之在中國、現仍具有威權、此等不能黏合之原因、則以大多數民衆、除於中國與中國間呈極度緊張狀態時、均係側重於家族或地方觀念、而不重國家觀念、現在雖巳有若干領袖、不復拘拘於此種狹囿之思想、但欲有眞正國家之統一、則必以大多數民衆具有國家觀念爲前題、至於在中國之共産主義、則又與在他國之情形不同、蓋共黨主義之在中國、並非如在他國僅爲一種政治上之主義、爲若干現存政黨中之黨員所信仰、亦並非一種特别黨之組織、冀與其他之政黨、爭奪政權、中國之所謂共黨、則實係對國民政府、爲實際之對抗者、不特此也、由共黨戰爭所産生之擾亂、則更因中國正在内部攺造之因難時期、而增加其嚴重、過去十一月間、且更因特别重大之外患、而愈增其糾紛、蓋共黨問題之在中國、實與一較大之問題、即國家攺造之問題、有不可分離之關係、</p>
<p>中國當此過渡時期、具有此不能避免之政治的社會的智識的及道德的種種紊亂情形、雖不免使友帮失望、且産生仇恨之念、足以爲和平之危險、調查團却認爲雖有此種種困難遲滯與失敗、中國方面、實巳有許多之進步、試將現在中國之情况、與一九二二年中國之情况、两相比較、即可知此言之非誣、現在中國中央政府之權力、在若干省分、固仍屬薄弱、但中央政權、要并未被否認、至少要未被明白否認、如果中央政府、能照此維持、則各省行政·軍隊·及財政、要均可逐漸使其具有國家性質、總之現政府對於攺造之努力、雖不免有若干之失敗、實巳有甚多之成就、</p>
<p>現代中國之民族主義、固係其經過此過渡時代之正當的現象、良以一國國民、旣有國家統一之覺悟、則當然具有一種對外解放之願望、但在中國、則於此種願望之外、因有國民黨之勢力、遂更引入一種極力反對外國勢力之不規則的色彩、本章即申述中國民族主義中所包含之重要的要求、以及各國對於此種要求之態度、（而尤以關於領事裁判權之放棄、及其對於維持中國法律秩序之關係爲尤詳、）中國前於華盛頓會議時、即早巳踏入以國際合作解决中國困難之途徑、果克遵循此途、繼續邁進、則自華會以來之十年中、中國殆早巳可有具體之進步、惟不幸因排外宣傅之熱烈、遂頓使進步遲滯、其中如經濟抵制、及將排外宣傅導入學校两事進行太猛、遂以造成本案發生時之特殊空氣、</p>
<p>日本爲中國最近之鄰邦、且爲其最大之顧客、其因中國流行之情形所遭逢之損害、自較其他之各國爲鉅、不過此項問題、雖使日本受有較他國更鉅之影響、　非僅爲一中日問題、且也、現在之極端的國際衝突、如能由國聨予以滿意解决、則正可使中國相信國際合作政策之利益、此項國際合作之政策、固係道源於華盛頓而於一九二二年發生極優良之影響者也、</p>
<p>第二章滿洲之狀况及其與中國其他部份及其與中國其他部份及俄國之關係本间叙述一九三一年九月前滿洲一般的狀况及其與中國其他部份及俄國之關係、稱東三省爲一廣大膏沃區域、四十年前、幾未開闢、迄今人口仍形稀少、對於解决中日人口過剩問題、李佔重要位置、河北山東两省之貧民、移殖於東三省者、以數百萬計、日本則將其工業品及資本輸入滿洲、以換取食糧及原料、若無日本之活動、滿洲不能引誘并吸收如此鉅額人民、若無中國農民及工人之源源而往、滿洲亦不能如此迅速發展、但滿洲雖極需要合作、因有前述理由、初則成爲日俄競爭區域、繼則成爲中國與其两强鄰之衝突地方、</p>
<p>當初中國對於發展滿洲、甚少努力、幾令俄國在該處有管轄之權、即在樸資茅斯條約重新確認中國在滿洲之主權後、在世界人士眼光中、仍認日俄两國在東三省之經濟活動、較中國本身爲顯著、同時中國數百萬農民之移殖、確定該處將來永爲中國之所有、當日俄國致力於割分利益範圍時、中國農民、即佔有土地、故目下滿洲之屬中國、巳爲不可變易之事實自一九一七年俄國革命後、中國對於東三省之管理及發展、開始積極進行、近年來更欲計劃減削日本在南滿之勢力、此種政策、使衝突益形擴大、至一九三一年九月衝突、達於頂點、</p>
<p>本章又叙述張作霖及張學良時代對於滿洲之政策及統治狀况、張作霖屢次對於北京政府、宣告獨立、但此種宣告、並不表示張氏或滿洲人民願與中國分離、其軍隊这入關、不能與外兵侵略相比擬、實則不過參加内戰耳、在一切戰爭及獨立時期中、滿洲仍完全爲中國領土、張作霖雖不贊成國民黨主義、但深盼中國之歸於統一、其對於日俄两國利益範圍之政策、證明若彼能將两國在該處之勢力加以肅清、彼必爲之、對於蘇俄之利益範圍幾乎乎告厥成功、并提倡建築鐵路政策、其結果即將南滿鐵路與其若干供給食料區域之聨絡切斷、自張作霖神秘被害案發生後、張學良不願日本之勸告、與南京方面及國民黨更爲密切聨絡、一九二八年十二月、宣告服從中央政府、實則在滿洲之武人統治制廉、依然存在、與從前無異、但在國民黨勢力之下、黨義宣傅及抗日活動、更爲緊張、</p>
<p>一九三一年九月前、關於東三省濫用私人、官僚腐化、及行政窳敗之普遍狀况、調查團獲得重要的申訴、但此種情形、不爲東三省所獨有、在中國其他各部、亦有同樣狀况、或且過之、雖有上述行政上弊病、但在中國亦有數處地方、努力攺良行政、其成績頗有可觀、在敎育市政及公用事業方面、尤多進步、其更可特别留意者、在張作霖及張學良統治時代、關於滿洲中國人民及利益、其經濟富源之發展及組織、較從前確有顯著之進步、</p>
<p>本章復叙述自訂立建築中東鐵路合同及一八九六年同盟恊約後、所有俄國及滿洲經過情形之各階段、一八九八年、租借遼東半島於俄國、一九○○年俄國佔據滿洲、日俄戰爭及樸資茅斯條約、一九一七年俄國革命及一九一八年至一九二○年恊約各國對俄干涉在滿洲之影響、一九二四年之中蘇協定、張作霖於蘇俄利益採取侵略政策後之事變、一九二九年蘇俄武力侵入滿洲北部及使中俄恢復原狀之一九二九年十二月伯力議定　、均一一叙述、最後一九○五年後日俄關於滿洲問題之關係、亦加以說明、</p>
<p>自樸資茅斯條約至俄國革命時期、日俄在滿洲之協調政策、因俄國革命及協約出兵西伯利亞而終止、加以蘇維埃政府態度、對於中國民族希望、與以猛烈的興奮、日本或認蘇維埃政府將擁護中國恢復主權之奮鬭、此種進展、使日本對於俄國舊有之憂慮、又復發生、北滿邊境外進入危險之可能、常使日本不能忘懷、北方共産學說及南方國民黨反日宣傅或相聨絡、益使日本渴望在两者之間、介以一與两者不生關係之滿洲、近年來蘇俄在外蒙古勢力之擴張、及中國共産黨之發展、均使日本憂慮、日益加增云、</p>
<p>第三章一九三一年九月十八日以前中日關於滿洲之爭執</p>
<p>本章叙述一九三一年九月十八日以前、中日間關於滿洲之主要爭執、近二十五年來、滿洲與其餘中國部分、關鍵益密、而同時日本在滿洲之得益、亦逐漸增加、滿洲之爲中國之一部、本無待證明、惟在此部份之内、日本得有非常權利、且是項權得、限制中國主權之行使、至種程度時、使中日两國不得不發生衝突、是項權利、概據於繼朴資茅斯條約而訂立之一九零五年中日會議東三省事宜條約、一九一五年之條約、即所謂二十一條者、以及各種鐵路合同試檢閱是項權利之綱目、即知在滿洲境内、中日間政治經濟法律關係之非常性質矣、如斯情勢、世界各國、無可比擬、一個國家、在鄰國領土内、竟能享受範圍如此廣大之經濟及行政權利、可謂絶無而僅有矣、此種情勢、祗有在两種條件之下、或者可以維持而不至於引起不斷不紛爭、其條件惟何、其一即出於雙方自由志願並同意承受、其一即出於雙方在經濟政治事項上曾經詳細考慮之合作政策、非然者、其結果决不能免於突衝也、</p>
<p>本章並叙述從一九三一年九月以前數年來、中日两國政府之態度及政策上表現之中日在滿洲根本利益之衝突、中國認滿洲爲糧食策源地、及國防第一線、而日本之態度則異是、日本要求在滿洲享有特殊權利、過去歷史及情緒之聨想戰略之成見、經濟利益、愛國觀念、國防心理與夫條約上特殊之權利、凡此種種、皆造成日本要求滿洲特殊地位之原因也、是項要求與中國主權衝突、並與國民政府减少</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>外人現有之特殊權益及抑止是項權　將來擴充之企圖亦不　相客、而日本所持事有特殊利益之要求、在日本間有解釋、請爲維滿洲之和平秩序起見、遇必要時日本有干涉之權者、</p>
<p>是項雙方態度及政策之根本衝突、遂引起两國當局關於有效或認爲有效之各項</p>
<p>複雜條約之解釋及適用上之種種具體爭執、是項爭執中之較重要者在本章内曾經分析列舉、如關於一九零五年中日會議東三省事宜條約之爭執並行線問題、關於各種鐵路合同之爭執、關於一九一五年條約之爭執、如日本人民在滿洲住及商租土地權、南滿鐵道地帶内之行政權、領館警察行使某種權力、朝鮮人民之地位等皆是也、至九三一年而中日两國間關係益呈緊張、萬寳山案、朝鮮暴動排斥華僑案、中村大尉被殺問題等、於　聨關發生、非偶然也、</p>
<p>一九三一年八月杪、中日　關於滿洲之關係因種種糾紛與不幸事件而緊張至於極度、雙方抗爭各有是處、亦曾用外交常用之方式企圖解决種種問題、但因長時間遷延不决之故、日本方面竟不復再能忍耐、尤以日本軍界爲甚、當時曾要求中村案立刻解决、軍人團體如帝國在鄉軍人會、鼓動日本　情、尤爲有力、於是解决一切中日懸案、必要時用武力解决等口號、遂囂騰於日本民衆之口矣、</p>
<p>第四章一九三一年九月十八日以後滿洲事變之序述</p>
<p>第四章叙述種日益增長之緊張情形、如何達到九月十八夜之爆發、關於九月十八夜之事變、中日两方持論不同、互相抵觸、調查團儘量接見在事變發時及在事變發生不久以後旅居瀋陽各外籍代表、包括報館訪員、其結果乃得下列之結論、關於九月十八日瀋陽事變之結論、「中日雙方軍隊感情之緊張、無待欵義」、（此節述報告肅原文）「依據調查團所得種種確切之說日、則可知日方係抱有一種精密預備之計劃、以因應該國與中國方面萬一發生之敵對行爲」、</p>
<p>「一九三一年九月十八夜、該項計劃曾以敏捷準確之方法實行之」</p>
<p>「中國方面依照其所奉訓令、並無進擊日軍、亦並無在特定時間及地點、危害日僑生命財産之計劃、對於日本軍隊、並未作一致進行或曾經許可之攻擊、日方之進攻、及其事後之軍事行爲、實出中國方面意料之外」、</p>
<p>「九月十八日下午十時至十時三十分之間、在鐵路上或鐵路附近、確曾有炸裂物爆發之事、惟鐵路即使受有損害、但事實上並示阻碍長春南下列車準時之到達、且即就鐵路損害之本身而論、實亦不足以證明軍事行動之正當」、</p>
<p>「是晚日方之軍事行動、不能視爲合法自衛之辦法」、「惟當地官佐、或以爲彼等之行爲、係出於自衛、調查團於說明上開各節時、並不將此項假定予以擯斥」、後來之軍事行動本章繼述日本軍隊在滿洲之配置、及其在九月十八夜及以後之行動、凡關九月十八日至十九日長春之佔領、九月二十一日吉林之佔領、十月八日錦州之轟炸、及起自十月中、終於十一月九日、日軍佔領齊齊哈爾之嫩江橋戰事、均有詳細之溯述、其時天津又於十一月八日及二十六日發生事變、關於該項事變之陳述、頗有參差、且不明瞭、本報告書中、則解釋此項事變、對於東省情况之影響、並述久寓天津日租界之廢帝、潛赴旅順、又叙明一九三二年一月三日錦州被佔之經過、</p>
<p>本章復繼續追述日軍在北滿之軍事動作、包含今年二月五日哈爾濱之被佔、直叙至本年八月底之軍事動作爲止、其中曾詳叙在東省各地之混戰、此項戰地大率仍爲中國正式軍隊及非正式軍所佔有、由日軍及僞組織軍隊與之對峙、調查團對於此項戰事、認爲無法叙述其確切之狀况良以中國當局、關於是項仍在東省與日軍對峙之軍隊、當然不願露洩確切之情報而在日本方面、則對於此等仍與日軍爲敵之軍隊之數目與戰鬥力、則又喜故意爲之貶損也、</p>
<p>一九三二年九月初初間之軍事狀况調查團並表示在最近之將來、滿洲之一般狀况、能否預期其變更、殊覺不能遽斷、在報告書脫稿之際、戰事尙在繼續、且蔓延甚廣、至關於遼熱邊境之軍事動作、該報告書以爲該地戰區之推廣、實爲難於逆料之事、不可不計慮者也、</p>
<p>第五章上海</p>
<p>本章叙述、自二月二十日起、迄日本軍隊最後撤退時止之上海戰事、國聨所派領團委員會亦於此結束其報告、調查團謂該團於三月十四日抵上海、實一機會、蓋以職務言、　可　　　　領　委員會之工作亦不必對此地方事件作特别之　　、但既巳抵滬、對於　　空氣上造成　亦不無　益、調查團分析中日雙方最後簽訂之協定後、曾表示意見、　上海事件對於滿洲形勢確實　生重大影響因中日戰事　　　　人心、結果使中國抵抗之心愈堅、同時在滿洲地方、自接上海消息後、　使現在散處各地之抗日軍精神爲之一振、本章末設、叙述一九三二年二月一日之下調日機開砲事件、此案、中日雙方報告大相逕庭、</p>
<p>第六章「滿洲國」</p>
<p>本章叙述「滿洲國」、分爲三部、第一部「新國成立之過　」、首述日本佔領　陽後所發生之混亂情形、次述　陽及各省秩序及行政之逐漸恢復、又次述「新國」之成立、廢帝　　之被命爲臨時執政、三月九日在長春就職之典禮、及「滿洲國」組織下之一切法令、此段以下列文字作結束、</p>
<p>自一九三一年九月十八日以後、日本軍事當局之行動、在軍事民事上均以政治作用爲目標、遂步以武力佔領東三省、由中國治權之下、遞次奪去齊齊哈爾錦州哈爾濱最後並及於所有滿洲境内之重要城市、並在每次佔領之後、即將該處行政機關攺組、由此可知在一九三一年九月以前、滿洲稁未聞有獨立運動、其所以有此運動得、乃日本軍隊在塲所致也、</p>
<p>一學日本文武官吏現任與退職者均有、圖謀組織實施此項運動、以爲解决九月十八日以後滿洲局面之辦法、</p>
<p>「以此爲目的、該員等利用某某等華人之名義及行動、又利用不滿以前政府之少」</p>
<p>數居民、」</p>
<p>「由此亦可知日本參謀部最初或不久、巳知可以利用此項獨立運動、因此該部對於獨立運動之組織者、予以援助及指揮、」</p>
<p>「以各方面所得之一切證據而論、本調查團認爲「滿洲國」之搆成、雖有若干助成份子、但其最有力之两種份子、厥爲日本軍隊之在塲及日本文武官吏之活動、　以本調查團之判斷若無此二者、則「新國」决不能成立也、」</p>
<p>「基此理由、現在之政權、不能認爲由眞正及自然之獨立運動所産生、」</p>
<p>本章第二部、述現在之「滿洲國」政府由基本法及行政立塲上、詳察其組織、並及於財政敎育司法警察陸軍金融情况等等、又述如何接收鹽政海關及郵政之情形、最終乃列入調查團對於本案之評判、在此段中調查團宣稱「滿洲國」政府之計畫、列有若干開明之攺革、其實行不僅利於滿洲、即中國之其餘部分、亦屬相宜、而在事實上、此種攺革、巳多見於中國政府計畫之中、然調查團意見、以爲「滿洲國」實施此種攺革計畫之時期雖短、及對於其巳施步驟、雖巳予以相當注意、然仍認爲並無象徵足以證明該「政府」在事實上能實施甚多故革、例如業經頒布之預算及錢幣攺良計畫、其實施之前途、似有嚴重之阻礙、在一九三二年之不安定及擾亂情形之下、徹底的攺革計畫、安定情况、及經濟繁榮、决雖實現至於該「政府」其各部名義上之領袖、雖係住居滿洲之中國人、但其重要之政治行政權、則仍操諸日本官吏及日人顧問之手、該「政府」之政治的及行政的組織不僅予此項官吏及顧問以供獻技術上意見之權、抑且予以實行管理及指揮行政之機會、此輩固不受東京政府之訓令、其政策亦非與日本政府或關東軍司令部之政策、常相符合、但遇重要問題時、該官吏與顧問、於新組織成立之初期、稍有自主行動之能力者、巳漸受脅迫、遵照日本當局意旨行事、此當局者因其軍隊佔領滿洲土地、而「滿洲國政府」、又依賴該軍隊維持其對内對外權威、同時「滿洲國」管轄下之鐵路、又委託南滿鐵路株式會社代行管理、最後又以有日本領事駐在各重要城市、以通聲氣、以故無論遇何事機彼日本當局者均有運用其絶大力量之方法、「滿洲國政府」與日本當局間之聨絡、新近因派遣專使、更覺密切、此專使雖未正式授權、但巳駐在滿洲都城、以關東租借地總督之名義、管轄南滿鐵路株式會社、同時兼行外交代表、領事及駐軍總司令之職權、「滿洲國」與日本之關係前此頗不易解說、但據調查團所得之最近消息、日本政府有不久即將此項關係加以確定之意向、今年八月二十七日日本代表、曾致函調查團、謂武藤專使巳於八月二十日離東京赴滿洲、抵滿後即與「滿洲國」開始談判締結日本與滿洲間之基本友誼條約、日本政府認此項條約之締結、爲對「滿洲國」之正式承認、</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>本章第三部分論及滿洲居民對於「新國家」之態度、調查團首說明在黨時情况之下、搜集此項證據頗多困難、良以因防範實在或想像的危險、而加諸調查團之特</p>
<p>殊保護、頗足使一般證人望風却走、諸多華人、甚至有不敢與調查團團員一面者、以故與各界接談、殊匪易易、非秘密約會不可、然調查團仍排除萬難、除與各官長公開談話外、仍得達到與商人銀行家敎員醫師警察職工等私人談話之目的、</p>
<p>調查團並曾接到書信一千五百餘件、其中親手交來者、但大多數係由郵局展轉遞到、如此得來之消息、均於可能範圍内向中立方面加以復證、調查團次解繹其所接觸之各羣民衆之心理狀態、最後下一結論謂少數團體間或有擁護「滿洲國」者、但「一般華人均異其趨、此所謂「滿洲國政府」者、在當地華人心目中直是日人之工具而巳、」</p>
<p>第七章日人之經濟利益與華人之經濟絶交</p>
<p>本章對於中日間之鬥爭、認爲不僅屬於軍事性質、抑且屬於經濟性質、中國以抵制貨物船舶曁銀行等事、爲反抗日本之武器、其目的在與日方完全斷絶經濟及財政之關係、</p>
<p>調查團於旣經指出日本以發展工業及輸出製成物品爲解决日本人口問題主要方法之一、並經調查日本之在華經濟與財政利益後、即進行研究經濟絶交之運動、調查團以爲華人所用之經濟絶交、係導源於、世紀以來之習慣、其因此所得之訓練及心理態度、與國民黨所代表之現代民族主義相混合、遂以搆成今日經濟絶交之運動、其影響中日關係、自物質與心理两方面觀察俱甚重大、</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>調查團巳得有結論、以爲華人之經濟絶交、旣屬普遍、且有組織、發端於强烈之民族情緒、而强烈之民族情緒又從而鼓舞之、然此項經濟絶交、有國體主使之、指揮之、該項團體能發之、亦能收之、且有威嚇之方法以實行之、在組織方面、雖包括多數個别團體在内、而重要支配之機關、厥爲國民黨、至關於經濟絶交之方法、調查團聲明非法舉動常所不免、但於此對於直接反對日本僑民之舉動、與意在損害日人利益因而反對違背經濟絶交章程之中國人民舉動、二者要應分别觀察第一種之情事、與往昔之經濟絶交相比、現巳較爲少見、而第二種之情事、則層見疊出、調查團之意見、以爲中國政府因未曾充分制止此種舉動、且對於經濟絶交運動並曾予以某種直接援助之故應負責任、調查團並未提議謂政府機關援助經濟絶交之運動、係屬不正當之事、但僅願表而出之者、即官方之鼓勵不無含有政府之責任耳、</p>
<p>中國政府宣稱、經濟絶交、係抵禦强國武力侵略之合法武器、尤以在仲裁方法未經事先利用之事件中爲然、此說就調查團之意見、引起一性質更廣之問題、中國人民在不以越出家法律範圍之條件下、其個人拒絶購買日貨或以個人行動或團體行動宣傅此項意見之權、無人可予否認、然而單獨對於某一國家之貿易、實行有組織之抵制、是否合於睦誼、抑或與條約義務不相抵觸、乃係一國際法之問題、而不在調查團調查範圍之内、爲舉世各國之利益計、調查團希望此項問題、應及早加以討論、并以國際協約加以規定、</p>
<p>本章結論稱、以中日貿易互之相依賴、及雙方之利益而言、經濟接近、實有必要、但两國間政治關係、一日不圓滿、以至於一方採取武力、一方則採取經濟抵制力量以相扼持、則一日無接近之可能、</p>
<p>第八章在滿洲之經濟利益</p>
<p>本章簡單討論在滿洲之經濟利益、注重中日两國、關於此項利益之詳細研究、另有特别說帖附於報告書之後、該項說帖、涉及種種問題、如投資、日本與滿洲之經濟關係、中國與該區之經濟關係、日本移民滿洲之機會、中國移民於滿洲之影響、鐵路與貨幣問題等等、調查團於本章中表示、深信中日两國在滿洲之經濟利益、就其本身離開近年來政治事件而言、應入於互諒合作之途、不應發生衝突、欲求滿洲現在富源、以及將來經濟能力之充分發展、雙方修好實爲必要、</p>
<p>調查團並聲明、門户開放之原則、本獨就法律觀點言、即就實際觀點言、均要必須維持、此項原則之維持、乃日本、滿洲、及中國其他各部之福也、</p>
<p>第九章解决之原則及條件</p>
<p>前章之復述、中日問題之本身、用公斷方式非無解决之可能、然因各該國政府、處理此問題、尤以滿洲問題爲甚、使两國關係益臻惡化、遂致衝突、遲早不能避免、業於本報告書之前數章述明、中國乃一由政治上之糾紛、社會上之紊亂、與夫因過渡時代所不可避免之分裂趨勞而進展之國家、亦經大概叙及、日本所主張之權利與利益、如何因中國中央政府權力薄弱、致受重大之影響、及日本如何急欲使滿洲與中國政府分離、亦經闡明、試稍一研究中俄日三國政府在滿洲之政策、即可知以前東三省地方政府、雖對中國中央政府宣布獨立、非僅一次、特其人民悉爲中國人、固未嘗有與中國脫離之意、最後、吾人曾悉心詳查自一九三一年九一八以來之眞確事件、並曾發表吾人對此之意見、</p>
<p>問題之複雜</p>
<p>現在吾人可對於過去之感想作一結束、而集中注意點於將來、凡閱過前章者、必明瞭現在衝突中之問題、並不如尋常所擬議者之簡單、實則此項問題異常複雜、而惟深悉一切事實及其歷史背景者、始足以表示一正確之意見、良以此案旣非此國對於彼國不先利用國際聨合會盟約所定和平處理之機會、而遽行宣戰之事件、亦非此一鄰國以武力侵犯彼一鄰國邊界之簡單案件、實因滿洲具有許多特點、非世界其他各地所可確切比擬者也、」此項爭議係發生於國際聨合會两會員國間、涉及領土之遼闊與法德两國相埒、雙方均認有權利與利益於其間、而其權益中爲國際公法所明白規定者、僅有數端耳、又該領土在法律上雖爲中國不可分之一部、其地方政府實具有充分自治性質得與日本直接談判事件、而此類事件乃此次衝突之根源也、</p>
<p>滿洲情况非他地所可比擬</p>
<p>日本管有一條鐵路、及由海口直達滿洲中心之一叚土地、約有一萬兵士保護該地、日本並主張依照條約於必要時有增兵至一萬五千之權、對於在滿洲之日僑、亦行使其本國裁判權、領事警察之設置遍於東三省、</p>
<p>解釋之不同</p>
<p>上述各節爲辯論此問題者所必須考慮、其事實爲未經宣戰、現有一大部分地面向爲中國領土顯無疑議者竟爲日本武力强奪佔領、且因此種行爲使其與中國分離並宣布獨立焉、此案經過所採之步驟、日本謂爲合於國際聨合會盟約非戰公約及華盛頓九國條約之義務而實則各該約之意義正在防止此種行爲、且此種行爲開始於提出報告於國際聨合會之初而完成於嗣後之數月、乃日本政府以爲此種行爲與其代表在日内瓦九月三十日及十二月十日所提出之保證相符合、爲此項行動作辯護者、謂一切軍事行動爲合法之自衛運動、該項自衛權利、在上述各項國際條約中旣均有包含、即國聨行政院亦未有任何决議加以取消、至於替代中國在東三省之行政組織之新組織、則謂係當地人民之行動、自願獨立、而與中國分離、另組政府、此種眞正之獨立運動、自不爲任何國際條約或任何國聨行政院中决議</p>

<p>星期壹（七）</p>
<p>所禁止、且是項事實之發生、巳將九國條約之引用、予以重大之攺易、並將國聨正在調查事件之性質、完全變更、此種辯護論調實使該項衝突頓形複雜與嚴重、本調查團之任務、並不在就該案作辯論、但欲設法供結充分之材料、使國聨能得一適合於爭議國雙方之榮譽尊嚴旣國家利益之解决辦法、僅恃褒貶不足以達此目的、必須從事於調解之切實努力、吾等曾力求滿洲事件過去之眞相而坦白說明之、並承認此僅爲一部分之工作、且非最要部分、我等在調查期間、曾迭告雙方政府、願以國聨之力助两國調解爭端、且决定向國聨建議、以適合於公道與和乎之辦法、保持中日两國在滿洲之永久利益、不能認爲滿意之解决辦法、</p>
<p>（一）恢復舊狀</p>
<p>由上述各節觀之、可以明瞭如僅恢復舊狀、並非解决辦法、因此次衝突原係發生於在去年九月前所存在之各種情形之下、故今日如將各該情形恢復原狀、亦徒使糾紛重見、是僅就該案全部之理論方面着想、而未顧及其局勢之眞相者也、</p>
<p>（二）維持「滿洲國」</p>
<p>從前述两章觀之、維持及承認滿洲之現在政體、亦屬同樣不適當、因我等認爲此種解决辦法、與國際義務之主要原則不合、並與遠東和平所繫之两國好感有碍、且違反中國之利益、不顧滿洲人民之願望、兼之此種辦法、日後是否可以維護日本永久之利益、亦尙屬疑問、滿洲人民對於現時政體之情感如何、可無疑義、中國亦决不願接受以東三省與本國完全分離之辦法、作爲一種最後之解决、即以遠處邊陲之外蒙古與滿洲相比擬、亦欠切當、因外蒙古與中國並無經濟上與社會上之密切關係、且人口稀少、大部分均非漢人、而滿洲之情形、則與外蒙古大異、現今在彼方耕種之數百萬漢人、竟使滿洲成爲關内中國之天然延長、且從種族文化及國民性情各方面言之、東三省之中國化程度、直使其與其鄰省河北山東無異、因其大部分之移民、均來自該两省也、</p>
<p>且就巳往之經騐、可以證明從前在滿洲當局、曾對於中國其他各部｜至少華北｜之事務有重大之影響、且佔有毫不容疑之軍事上與政治上之便利、無論在法律上或事實上、將該省等自中國他部割離、日後恐將造成一嚴重難解之問題、使中國常存敵意、並或將引起繼續抵制日貨之運動、本調查團曾接到日本政府關係於該國在滿洲重大利益之一明晰而有價值之聲明書、關於日本對於滿洲經濟上之依賴前章巳經論及、本調查團不必再爲之舖張、本調查團亦不主張日本因經濟關係而得享有經濟甚至政治管理權、但吾人仍承認滿洲在日本經濟發展上之重要性、日本爲該國經濟發展之必要、要求建設一能維持秩序之鞏固政府、吾人亦不以爲無理、但此種情况惟有一合於當地民意、而完全順乎彼等之情感及志願之管理機關、始能切實擔保、吾人更信惟有在一種外有信仰内有和平而與遠東現有情形完全不同之空氣中、爲滿洲經濟迅速發展所必要之投資、始可源源而來、現雖有人口過剩增加之苦、日本似尙未充分使用其現有之便利、以從事於移民、日本政府迄今尙無大規樣移民滿洲之計劃、但日本確欲利用再進一步之實業計劃、以謀農業危機及人口問題之解决、　　實業計劃、需要擴大　　　　、而此種擴大而比較可靠之市塲、日本僅能在亞洲尤其在中國、始　　　、日本不僅需要滿洲市塲、即全中國市塲亦在需要之列、而中國之鞏固　近代化、自能使生活程度抬高、因而使貿易興奮、並增加中國市塲之購買力、</p>
<p>中日間此種經濟之接近、固與日本有重大之利益、與中國亦有同等之利益蓋中國藉此經濟上及技術上與日本合作、可獲得建設國家主要工作上之助力、中國若能抑制其國家主義難堪之趨勢、並俟友好關係恢復後、切實擔保有組織之抵貨運動不再發生、則於此項經濟接近大有裨助、在日本一方面若不用使中國友誼及合作成爲不可能之方法、以圖謀使滿洲問題脫離中日全部問題而單獨解决、則此項經濟接近亦當易於實現、</p>
<p>使日本决定其在滿洲之動作及政策者、經濟原因或較次於其切身安全之顧慮、尤其日本文武官員、常謂滿洲爲日本之生命線、常人對於此種顧慮可表同情、並欲諒解其人因欲預防萬一而不惜冒重大責任之行動與動機、但日本欲謀阻止滿洲被利用爲攻擊日本之根據地、並欲於滿洲邊境被外國軍隊衝過之某種情形下日本得爲適當之軍事佈置、吾人對此種種、固可承認、然吾人仍不無懷疑者、無期限之軍事佔據滿洲、致負財政上之重責、是否爲抵制外患之最有效方法耶、設遇外患侵襲之時、日本軍隊受時懷反側之民衆包圍、其後有包含敵意之中國、試問日本軍隊能不受重大之困難否耶、爲日本利益計、對於安全問題、亦可考量其他可能的判决方法、使更能符合現時國際和平機關之基本原則、並與世界其他列强間所締結之協定相似、日本甚或可因世界之同情與善意、不須代價而獲得安全保障、較現時以鉅大代價換得者爲更佳、</p>
<p>國際利益中日两國以外、世界其餘列强對中日爭議、均有重大利益、亟應維持、例如現行各種多方面條約、前巳提及、又此問題之眞正及最後之解决、必須適合世界和平機關所依據之根本條約、再華府會議各國代表所提出之主張、現仍有效、列强現時所持之權利主張、與一九二二年時同、即仍以扶助中國建設維持中國領土主權完整爲保持和平之必要條件、各種分解中國之行爲、必致立即引起國際間之競爭、此種國際競爭如與相異的社會制度間之衝突、同時發生則將更形激烈、要之、對於和平之要求、在世界各地皆然、倘國聨規約及非戰公約原則之實施在某地失其信仰、即在世界作何處所皆减少其價值及功能、</p>
<p>蘇聨之利益調查團對於蘇聨在滿洲之利益範圍未能獲得直接之報告、而蘇聨政府對於滿洲問題之意見亦未能臆斷、但雖無直接報告、而蘇聨存滿洲之舉動及在中東路曁中國國境外北部及東北部領土上之重要利益、均不容忽視、故解决滿洲問題時倘忽略蘇聨之重大利益、則此項解决必不能持久、且將引起將來和平之决裂、事極顯然、</p>
<p>結論倘中两國政府均能承認彼此主要權利之性質、並顯在此間維持和平樹立睦誼、則上述各節、足以指示問題之解决途徑、至恢復一九三一年九月以前狀態之不可能、前巳述及之矣、一種滿意合式之制度必須就現有制度攺進、不能採極端變動、我人將在次章提出若干種建議、以貫澈斯旨、茲先規定適當解决所採之原則於下、</p>
<p>適當解决之條件、</p>
<p>（一）適合中日雙方之利益雙方均爲國聨會員國、均有要求國聨同樣考慮之權利、如某種解决雙方均不能取得利益、對於和平前途毫無善果、</p>
<p>（二）考慮蘇聨利益倘僅促進相鄰二國間之和平、而忽略第三國之利益、則匪特不公、亦且不智、更非和平之所要求、</p>
<p>（三）遵守現行多方面之條約、某種解决必須遵守國聨盟約非戰公約及華盛頓九國條約之規定、</p>
<p>（四）承認日本在滿洲之利益日本在滿洲之權利及利益、乃不容漠視之事實、倘某種解决不承認此點或忽略日本與該地歷史上之關係、亦不能認爲適當之解决、　　（五）樹立中日間之新條約關係中日二國发欲防止其未來衝突、及回復其相互信賴與合作、必須另訂新約、將中日两國之權利利益與責任、重加聲叙、此項條約應爲雙方所同意之解决糾紛辦法之一部份、</p>
<p>（六）解决將來之有效辦法爲補充上開辦法以圖便利迅速解决隨時發生之輕微糾紛起見、有特訂辦法之必要、</p>
<p>（七）滿洲自治滿洲政府之攺組、應於無背於中國主權及領土完整之範圍内、使其享有自治權、以求適合於該三省之地方情形與特性、新民政機關之組織與行爲、務須具備良好政府之要件、</p>
<p>（八）内部須有秩序並須安全以禦外侮滿洲之内部秩序、應以有效的地方憲警維持之、至爲實現其足禦外侮之安全起見、則須將憲警以外之軍隊、掃數撤退、並須與關係各國訂立互不侵犯條約、</p>
<p>（九）掖勵中日間經濟協調之成立爲達到此目的、中日二國宜訂新通商條約、此項條約之目的、須爲將两國間之商業關係、置於公平基礎之上、並使其與两國間業經攺善之政治關係相適合、</p>
<p>（十）以國際合作促進中國之建設中國政局之不穩定旣爲中日友好之障碍、及爲其他各國所關懷、遠東和平之維持、旣爲有關國際之事件、而上述辦法、又非待中國具有强有力之中央政府時、不能實現、故其適當辦法之最終要件、厥惟依據孫中山博士之建議、以暫時的國際合作、促進中國之内部建設、</p>
<p>上述辦法實行後、結果之預測現在情勢之攺變、如能包括上述意見、及滿足上述條件、則中日二國當可將其困難解决、而两國間之密切諒解及政治合作之新時代、或將由此開始、如二國間不能成立協調、則無論具有何種條件之解决辦法、必將毫無效果可言、即在險象横生之今日、而上項新關係之能否出現、仍難預期、是則吾人之所不容諱言者、少年日本現正力主對中國採取强硬政策、及在滿洲採取澈底政策、凡爲此項主張之人靡不對於九一八以前之延宕政策以及掻不着癢處之手段、表示厭倦、彼輩現甚急燥及缺乏耐心以求其目的之達到、現在日本一切適當方法、亦尙在尋求中、經與主張積極政策最力之輩就中尤曾於一般具有確定不移之理想、及對之終身拳拳服膺、甚而至於身任樹立「滿洲國」之奇巧工作之先鋒而亦不恤者、加以注意、）接近之後、本團遂不得不承認此問題之垓心、自日人方面言之、純爲日人對於新中國之政治發展及此種發展之未來趨勢表示焦慮、此種焦慮、巳使日人採取種種以統制上項發展與左右上項趨勢爲目的之行動、俾日人之利益、得以安全、及其帝國國防戰略上之需要得以滿足、但日本與論巳有一空洞的覺悟、深知日本對滿洲及對滿滿洲以外之中國、絶無採取两個分離的政策之可能、是故縱以滿洲之利益爲主眼、日人亦或可對於中國民族精神之復興、表示同情的歡迎、亦或可視之爲友、引導其進程而畀之以帮助、但使日人此舉足使中國不另乞外援、則日人巳樂出此也、</p>
<p>中國有識之士旣巳承認建設與近代化爲該國之根本問題、亦即該國之眞正國家問題、則彼等不能不確認此種業巳開始、且有如許成功希望之建設、及近代化政策之完成實有賴於一切國家培植友好之關係、而與彼在咫尺之大國、維持良好之關係、巳屬重要、在政治上、及經濟上、中國均需要列强之合作、而日本政府之友善態度、及在滿洲方面之經濟合作、尤爲可貴、中國政府、應將基於新喚醒之民族主義之一切要求｜｜即使正當而且急切、置於此種國家内部建設之最高需要之下、</p>
<p>第十章審查意見及對於行政院之建議</p>
<p>向中日两國政府直接提出解决現時爭議之建議、非本調查團之職責、但爲便利两國間目前爭議原因之最後解决、（引用白里安向行政院說明組織本調查團之决議時所用之言）本調查團特於此將研究結果、建議於國際聨合會、以爲聨合會適當機關起草提交爭議國之確定方案時之帮助、此項建議之用意、在表明前章所設條件足以適用之一端耳、建議性質、僅涉及廣泛之原則、至於細目則、留待補充如爭議國願意接受基於此種原則之解决方法時、儘有修正之餘地、</p>
<p>假令日本在日内瓦方面尙未考慮本報告以前巳經正式承認滿洲國、此爲不容忽視之可能的事實、吾等工作、决不因此而喪失其價值、吾等深信本報告書所載建議、對於行政院將未爲滿足中日两方在滿洲之重大利益而爲之决定、或向两國所、爲之建議、將有所裨助、</p>
<p>吾等以此爲目的、故一方面顧及國聨原則、及關於中國一切條約之精神及文字、以及和平之普遍利益、而在另一方面仍不忽視現存之實况、及正在演化中之東三省行政機關、爲世界和平之最高利益計、無論將來將發生若何之事態、行政院之職責、終將爲决定如何始能使本報告中之建議推行、并適用於現在發展中之一切事件、以期利用現正在滿洲醖釀之一切正當勢力、或爲理想或人力、或爲思想或行動、藉謀獲得中日間長久之諒解、請當事雙方討論解决辦法、首先建議國聨行政院、應請中國政府旣日本政府依照前章所示之綱領、討論两國糾紛之解决、顧問會議此項邀請、如經接受、第二步即應及早召集一顧問會議討論、并提出詳密之建議、設立一種特殊制度、以治理東三省、</p>
<p>此項會議、可由中日两國政府之代表·曁代表當地人民之代表團两組組成之、該两代表團、一由中國政府規定之方法選出之、一由日本政府規定之方法選出之、如經當事雙方同意、亦可得中立觀察員之協助、</p>
<p>如該會議有任何特殊之點、不克互相同意時、該會議可將此意參差之點、提出於行政院、行政院對此當設法覓得一同决之解决辦法、</p>
<p>同時於顧問會議開會期中、所有中日間關於各該國權利與利益所爭論之事件、應另行討論、倘經當事雙方同意、亦可得中立觀察人員之協助、</p>
<p>吾等末後提議、此項討論與談判之結果、應包括下列四種文件之中、一、中國政府宣言、依照顧問會議所提辦法、組織一種特殊制度、治理東三省、二、關於日本利益之中日條約、</p>
<p>三、中日和解公斷不侵犯與互助條約、</p>
<p>四、中日商約、</p>
<p>在顧問會議集會之前、應由當事雙方、以行政院之協助、對於該會議應行考量之行政制度之方式、先行協定其大綱、此際所應考量之事件如下、</p>
<p>顧問會議之集會地點、代表之性質、是否願有中立觀察人員、</p>
<p>維持中國領土行政完整之原則、及准許東省有高度之自治、</p>
<p>以一種特殊憲兵、爲維持内部治安唯一辦法之政策、</p>
<p>以所擬各種條約解决所爭各項事件之原則、對於所有曾經參加東省最近政治運動之人員、准予特赦、</p>
<p>此種原則大綱、旣經事先同意、關於其詳細辦法、得以最充分可能之審擇權、留諸參加顧問會議或磋商條約之代表、至再行訴諸國聨行政院之舉、僅得於不能同意時行之、</p>
<p>此項程序之優點此項程序之各種優點中、可稱道者、在於此項程序旣與中國主權不相違反、仍可採取實際有效之辦法、以適應滿洲今日之局勢、同時爲今後因應中國内部現狀之變遷、留有餘地、例如在滿洲最近所巳提議、或巳實際施行之某種行政、與財政之變更、本報告書中所巳注意者、如省政府之攺組、中央銀行之設立、以及外國顧問之雇用等等、此類特點、顧問會議或可因其利便而予以保留、又如依照吾等所提議而選出滿洲居民代表出席顧問委員會之方法、亦可爲現政體與新政體遞嬗之協助、</p>
<p>此項爲滿洲而設之自治制度、擬僅施行於遼寗（奉天）吉林黑龍江三省、日本現時在熱河省（東内蒙古）所享有之權利、當於關係日方利益之條件中、加以說明、茲將四項文件、依次討論如下、</p>
<p>（一）宣言</p>
<p>顧問會議之最後提議、當送交中國政府、由中國政府以該項提議列入宣言之内、轉送國際聨合會及九國條約之簽字各國、國聨會員國及九國條約之簽字國、對於此項宣言、當表示知悉、而是項宣言將被認爲對於中國政府有國際協定之約束性質、</p>
<p>此項宣言、嗣後尙須修攺、其條件當依照上述之程序、彼此同意、於宣言本身中、預爲規定、</p>
<p>此項宣言、對於中國中央政府在東三省之權限、與該地方自治政府之權限、加以劃分、</p>
<p>保留於中央政府之權限茲提議保留於中央政府之權限如下、</p>
<p>（一）除特别規定外、有管理一般的條約及外交關係之權、但應了解中央政府不得締結與宣言條欵相遣反之國際協定、</p>
<p>（二）有管豁海關郵政鹽務所之權、或於可能範圍内、有管豁印花稅及烟酒稅行政之權、關於此類稅欵之純收入、中央政府與東三省政府間如何公平分配、當由顧問會議决定之、</p>
<p>（三）有依照宣言所規定之程序、任命東三省政府行政長官之權、至少初步應當如此、至出缺時或以同樣方法補充、或以東三省某種選舉制度行之、當由顧問會議合意議定、并列入宣言之内、</p>
<p>（四）對於東三省行政長官爲頒發某種必要訓令、以保證履行中國中央政府所締結關於東三省自治政府管轄下各事項之國際協定之權、</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>星期壹（八）</p>
<p>（五）顧問會議所合意議定之其他權限、</p>
<p>地方政府之權限凡一切其他權限、均屬於東三省自治政府地方民意之表示、應計劃某種切實可行之制度、以期獲得人民對於政府政策所表示之意見、或即襲用自昔相沿各機關、如商公所及其他各市民機關亦可、</p>
<p>少數民族應訂立某種規定、以保護白俄及其他少數民族之利益、</p>
<p>憲兵茲提議由外國敎練官之栛助、組織特别憲兵、爲東三省境内之唯一武裝實力、該項憲兵之組織、或於一預定時期内完成之、或在宜言内預定程序、規定其完成時期、該項特别隊伍、旣爲東三省境内唯一武裝實力、故一俟組織完成、其他一切武裝實力、即應退出東三省境内、所謂其他一切武裝實力、包括中國方面或日本方面之一切特别警隊、或鐵路守備隊、</p>
<p>外國顧問自治政府行政長官得指派相當數額之外國顧問、其中日本人民應佔一重要之比例、至細目應依上述程序訂定、並於宣言内聲明之、各小國人民有被選之權、與大國同、</p>
<p>行政長官得就國聨行政院所提名單中、指派國籍不同之外籍人員二名、監督（一）警察、及（二）稅收機關、該二員在新政體草創及試行期内、當掌有廣泛權限、顧問權限當在宣言中規定之、</p>
<p>行政長官就國際清理銀行董事會提出之名單中、當指派一外國人、爲東三省中央銀地之總顧問、</p>
<p>至於僱用外籍顧問及官員一節、實與中國國民黨總理及現今國民政府之政策相符、吾等希望中國輿論對於在東省方面外人權利、與勢力之複雜、及其實際狀况、不難認識、爲謀和平及善良政治起見、不能不有特殊之處置、須知此間所提議之外籍顧問及官員、及在組織新制度時期内、應有特别廣泛權限之顧問、純爲代表一種國際合作之方式、此項人員之選出、應在中國政府所能接受之狀態内行之、且須與中國主權不相抵觸、經指派後、此項人員、應認自身爲雇用國政府之公僕與在過去時期内關稅及郵政或國聨與中國合辦之專門機關所雇用之外籍人員相同、</p>
<p>關於此節、内田氏於一九三二年八月二十五日在日本議會演說中之一段、可予注意、</p>
<p>「我國政府自明治維新以後、雇用多數外籍人員爲顧問·或正式官吏、在一八七五、年前後、其數目超過五百人之多、」</p>
<p>當有一點可注意者、即在中日合作空氣中指派較多日籍顧問、可使此項官員貢獻其特别適合於當地情形之訓練與學識、此項過渡時代所應抱之最後目的、乃爲造成一種純粹中國人之吏治、使無雇用外人之需要、</p>
<p>（二）關保日方利益之中日條約</p>
<p>中日間擬議之三種條約商訂人、自應有完全審擇之權、但於此處略示訂約時所應議之事項、自不爲無益、</p>
<p>提及東省方面日方利益、及熱河省日方一部分利益之條約、自必涉及日僑之某種經濟利益及鐵路問題、此項條約之目的、應爲</p>
<p>一、東省經濟上之開發、日方得自由參加、但不得因此而取得經濟上或政治上管理該地之權、</p>
<p>二、日本在熱河省現在享有之權利、予以維持、</p>
<p>三、居住及租地之權、推及於東省全境、同時對於領事裁判權之原則、酌予變更　　四·鐵路使用之協定、</p>
<p>在南滿與北滿間、雖並未訂有固定界線、但日本人民之居住權、向僅限於南滿及熱河、日本人民行使此項權利之態度、常使中國方面、認爲不能容受、因是而發生不斷之齬齟與衝突、在納稅及司法方面、日本人民及朝鮮人民、俱認爲享有領事裁判權之待遇、關於鮮民方面、實另有特殊規定、不過此項規定、未能完善、致常爲爭執之焦點、就調查團所得、證明吾等相信若不附有領事裁判權、中國願將現在有限制之居住權、推及於東省全境、因附帶領事裁判權之結果、認爲可使在中國境内造成一日本民族之國家也、</p>
<p>居住權與領事裁判權、關係密切、至爲明顯、而在東三省司法行政及財務行政未達到較前此更高之程度以前、日本不欲放棄領事裁判權地位、其事亦同樣明顯、於是有調和方法三種、其一現有之居住權、及其附帶之領事裁判權地位、應予以維持、其範圍應加以擴大、俾在北滿及熱河之日本人民及朝鮮人民、均得享受、但無領事裁判權、其二在東三省及熱河省内之任何地方日本人民、應予以居住權及領事裁判權、而朝鮮人民僅有居住權而無領事裁判權、是两項建議、各有優點亦各有可以嚴重反對之處、果能將東北各省之行政效率增高、使領事裁判權不復需要、此則本問題最滿意之解决方法也、本調查團以是建議地方最高法院、應延用外國顧問、至少二人、其一須爲日本國籍、其他法院延用顧問、亦殊爲有利、法院審理涉及外國人之案件時、顧問對於各案之意見、不妨公布、本調查團以爲在攺組期間、財務行政方面、參以外人之監督、亦殊屬相宜、本調查團討論中國宣言時、關於上節、業巳有所提議矣、</p>
<p>更進一步之保障、可依和解條約、設立公斷法院、以處理中國政府或日本政府、以政府名義或其人民名義所提出之任何聲訴、</p>
<p>此項複雜與困難問題之裁决、必須歸諸議訂條約之當事國、但現時所取之保護外國人制度、苟施於多如朝鮮人之少數民族、在朝鮮人數目繼續增加及其與中國人民密接雜處情形之下、發生刺激之機會、因而引致地方意外及外國干涉、殆爲必然之事、爲和平利益計、此項衝突之源、應予消弭、</p>
<p>日本人民之居住權利、如有任何推廣、應在同樣條件之下、適用於其他一切享有最惠國條欵利益之國家之人民、祇須此類享有領事裁判權人民之國家、與中國訂立同樣條約、</p>
<p>鐵路關於鐵路在過去期中、中國與日本之鐵路、建造者及當局者缺乏合作、不知成就一廣大而互利之鐵路計劃、此在第三章中巳論之矣、將來苟欲免除衝突則在現時擬議之條約中、必須加以規定、使巳在往之競爭制度、歸於消滅、而代以關於各路運費及價目之共同諒解、此項問題、在本報告書之附件、特别研究、第一號内、另有討論、在本調查團之意、以爲有两種可能之解决、此两種解决、可擇一而行、或可視爲達到最後解决之步驟、</p>
<p>第一種方法範圍較爲限制、係中日鐵路行政之業務協定、足以便利彼此合作者、中日两國可根據合作原則、協議管理在滿洲之各有鐵路制度、並設一中日鐵路聨合委員會、至少加以外國顧問一人、其行使之職務、則類苦他國現行之理事會然、至於更澈底之救濟方策、莫若將中日两國之鐵路利益合併、如雙方能同意於此種合併辦法、即爲中日两國經濟合作之眞實表記、使中日得有經濟上之合作、固爲本報告書目的之一且此種合併辦法、一方面旣可保障中國之利權、一方面又可使滿洲一切鐵路、得有利用南滿鐵路專門經騐之利益、而援照近數月來、應用於滿洲鐵路之制度、引伸推用、當亦可無困難、且將來更可藉此闢一種範圍較廣之國際協定新徑途、將中東鐵路包含在内、此種合併方法之較詳釋明、現雖載在附件之内、祗能視爲一種舉例、其詳細計劃、惟有由雙方直接談判、始可産生耳、鐵路問題、如此解决、則南滿鐵路全爲純粹的營業性質、特别警察保安隊、一旦完全組成、鐵路得有保障、則可使護路警撤退、而節省一種極大開支、此項辦法、如果實行、特别地産章程及特别市政制度、應即在鐵路地域範圍内、預先制定成立、俾南滿鐵路與日本國國民之旣得利益得有保障、</p>
<p>如能遵循以上途徑、議訂條約、則日本在東三省與熱河之權利、可有法律根據、其有益於日本、至少當與現有之條約協定相同、而在中國方面、亦當易予接受如一九一五年等條約與協定所給予日本一切確定讓與未爲此項新條約所廢棄或變更者、中國方面對之、當不致再有承認之困難、至於日本所要求之一切較爲次要之權利、其效力可發生爭執者、當以協定解决之、如不同意、應照和解條約中所載之辦法解决之、</p>
<p>（三）中日和解仲裁不侵犯及互助之條約、</p>
<p>本條約之内容、因巳有許多先例及現行成案可稽、自可不必詳細叙述、</p>
<p>照此條約、應設一和解委員會、其職務專爲帮助中日两方、解决两政府間所發生之任何困難、並設一公斷庭、以具有法律經騐及明瞭遠東情形者組織之、凡中日两國間、關於宣言或新條約之解釋、以及其他由和解條約所列舉之爭執、均應歸諸公斷庭辦理、復須依照加入約文内之不侵犯及互助各規定、締約國雙方同意、滿洲應逐漸成爲一無軍備區域、以此爲目的、應即規定、俟憲兵隊組織完竣後、締約國之一方或第三者、對無軍備區域之任何侵犯、即認爲侵略行爲、其他一方、如遇第三者攻擊時、則雙方有權採取認爲應行之任何辦法、以防衛無軍備區域、但並不妨害國聨行政院依照盟約處理之權、</p>
<p>倘蘇聨共和國政府、願意參加於此種條約之不侵犯及互助部分時、則此項相當之條欵、可另行列入一種三方協定、</p>
<p>（四）中日商約</p>
<p>商約自應以造成可以鼓勵中日两國盡量交易貨物、而同時並可保護他國現有條約權利之情形爲目的、此項條約、並應載入中國政府擔認在其權力之内、採取切辦法、禁止並遏抑有組織之抵制日貨運動、但不妨害中國買主之個人權利、評論以上關於擬議之宣言及各種條約目的之建議及理由、係提供國聨行政院之考慮、無論將來協定之細目爲何、最要在儘早開始談判、並應以互信之精神行之、</p>
<p>本調查團工作業巳告竣、</p>
<p>滿洲素稱天府之國、沃野萬里、一年以來、疊經擾攘、當地人民創鉅痛深、恐爲前此所無、</p>
<p>中日關係、巳成變相戰爭、膽念前途、可勝憂慮、其造成此種景况之情形、本調查團於本報告書中巳言之矣、</p>
<p>國聨應付本案、其嚴重之情勢及解决之困難、盡人皆知、本調查團、正在結束報告之際、報章適載中日两國外交部長之宣言、披閱之餘、各有要旨一點、茲特爲揭出、</p>
<p>八月二十八日羅文幹先生在南京宣稱、「中國深信將解决現在時局之合理辦法、必以不背國聨盟約、非戰公約、及九國條約之文字與精神、與夫中國之主權、同時又確能鞏固遠東永久之和平者爲必要條件、</p>
<p>八月三十日據報内田伯爵在東京宣稱、「政府認中日關係問題、較滿蒙問題更爲重要、」</p>
<p>本調查團以爲結束報告、莫妙於重述此两項宣言所隱伏之意思、與本調查團所搜集之證據、及本調查團對本案之研究曁其判斷、如是之確切相同、故敢信此種宣言所表示之政策、倘迅爲有效之應用、當能使滿案達到圓滿之解决、不特有裨有遠東两大國之利益、即世界人類、亦胥受其賜焉、（完）</p>

<p>國民社一日華盛頓電據此間今日種種表示而觀、美國在下星期考慮李頓調查報告所述滿洲各問題之際、將完全與國際聨盟合作、目下此間正以最大興味、守持該報告書之發表、冀望此項報告及其建議、可爲東方與西方各國關係上一重要之紀程石、據官塲表示、美國此時當未必有何驚人或完全新提議、因美國立塲經國務卿史汀生迭次宣言、再加參議員李德近赴歐洲與各國政治家面談、早巳明瞭云、</p>

<h3>日本提早發表李頓報告書</h3>
<p>外務省趕草意見書定四週内完成</p>
<p>對首五章少爭點對第六章頗非難</p>
<p>超越自衛權一點日軍部反對尤烈</p>
<p>電通二日東京電李頓報告書之翻譯、於昨夜完畢最後之整備、本日上午完畢英文及翻譯文之印刷、本日上午九時、由外務省公表、該報告書之本文、英文有三百八十九頁、翻譯文有八百頁、便宜上將内容要領撮爲五六十頁、與報告書同時發表、</p>
<p>電通二日東京電外務省於公表報告書後、即着手草擬日政府之意見書、外務省首腦部與軍部首腦部將舉行重要協議、並擬設置意見書起草委員會、豫定四週内完成、完成後即送日内瓦、同時該委員會審議對國聨理事會及總會之日本對策、</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電外務省對於李頓報告書之初步反響、總括言之、對第一·第二·第三·第五·第七·第八章、甚少爭點、惟對第六章則大加反對、因此章減削報告書全份之價值、似抱極烈之偏見而撰寫者、泛言之、對報告書之主要非難、爲關於滿洲之部分、分量過重、關於中國與遠東之部分、分量太輕、再如調查團能適當了解國聨决議案下之職責範圍、則第九第十两章不致列入、但此两章含有若干良好决議、此亦爲衆所承認者、他處非難之主要點、爲第八章所稱日本之爭滿洲行别地位、實與九國公約不符、及第四章所稱上年九月十八日夜間瀋陽附近鐵路橋之炸斷、不足爲實行軍事行動之理由、此後所取之行動、實越出自衛範圍等言、外務省發言人聲稱、政府之意以爲判决必須取何行動之人、以當時在塲者最爲適宜、故調查團之决議、實無接受之可能、惟李頓動爵與其同仁無汚辱日本陸軍爲侵略者之意志、此政府所引以爲慰者、關於第六章所言、調查團似太重視甚平凡無名華人之證據、而日本與「滿洲國」當局提出之證據、似反未見信、調查團僅在滿洲聲桓两星期之久、殊不足以查明一切、尤其在「滿洲國」新告成立諸事仍紊亂無條之時、再、調查團曾久居張學良勢力下之北平、故意向在有意無意之中、不免爲所搖動、此實確無可疑者、發言人繼乃評論最後數章、謂其中含有良好之决議若干、但日本决不能容第三者干預滿洲爭案之解决、亦不同意於自治之建議、蓋「滿洲國」今巳受日本承認也、日本以爲調查團之意見、並未啓中日議判滿案之途徑、惟調查團關於滿洲之建議、大可施於中國與列强間之關係而獲裨益、便如制定國際共管計畫問題是也、發言人於是對調查團之堅苦工作、表示欽佩、但又下斷語曰、「報告書中多有對日不公允處、而絶無對華不公允點」云、發言人末謂日政府將力駁滿洲獨立運動、乃日本陸軍參謀部所慫恿贊助之說、並稱、日本將發表文告、批駁矯正首八章誤記之事實、與謬訛之理想云、</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電日本陸軍當局現以鎭靜之氣度、接受李頓報告書、此實出乎一般之意料、陸軍省發言人今晚對報館記者稱讚調查團之工作、並謂陸軍省審閱報告書之撮要後、覺無更攺前昭告世界一切意見之必要、且深信國聨與列强將逐漸了解日本主張之公正云、</p>
<p>電通二日東京電陸軍方面對李頓調查團之報告書、由參謀本部與陸軍省分别審義至本日正午止、彚集意見、從午後一時起開各部聨合會議、决定最後的對策、於報告書公表後、即發表陸軍方面之意見、聞陸軍方面關於日本軍事行動之記述部分、較諸報告書之結論更爲重視、據確訊、該報告書對日本軍事行動、爲客觀的批評、謂日本軍人雖於未越处衛權範圍見解之下而行動、然日本之軍事行動、確超越自衛權之範圍云、如此當然違反聨盟規約第十條及非戰條約、故陸軍對此見解絶對反對、態度非常强硬、本日午後陸軍省及參謀本部聨合會議逹如何之最後决定、最堪重視、</p>
<p>日聨二日東京電外務省譯完李頓報告書後、將其譯文分配陸海軍省、由三省一齊開始檢討内容、並準備製作意見書、同時設立特别委員會辦理直接事務、對於國聨之意見書、鑒於其重要性、非獨由三省委員討議、同時參考政黨財界方面之意見而協力製作、關係各方面閱覺報告書後、略抱如次意見、故意見書亦以如次意見爲標準云、（一）李頓報告書之内容、對於日本有利六分、中國四分、各部分過於表明感情、又有故意擴張批評事實之點、例如叙述中日两國在滿洲歷史的關係之章、即以英美法等在自國殖民地實行之政治、於日本則視爲不當、外務省擬列舉一一具體的實例、與列國殖民政策互相比較、斷然加以反駁、（二）報告書之結論全部、日本對此不得不反對、尤其報告書不認將來日本在滿洲之駐兵權、此事足證調查團對於日本在滿歷史的特殊性、及滿洲治安現狀、完全無智識、陸軍似對此點加以反駁、</p>

<h3>两次談話節略</h3>
<p>中滿間任何連鎖决不使之存在</p>
<p>日承認僞組織爲日後吞併先聲</p>
<p>第一次談話</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社一日巴黎電本社茲由負責方面、得到本年七月間日本内田外相與調查團各委員两次談話之節略、茲特按問答式發表如下、「内田」日本承認滿洲國、並不違反任何條約、而在有關國家防衛之問題内、不能顧慮旁人之意見、「美委麥考益」貴國屢以國防·日本生存上之利益·以及滿洲人民自决權爲言、然本調查團就地考察之結果、證明人民自决權一層、實談不到、至於對日本在滿洲利益</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>之威脅、更可斷言其不存在、而九月十八日夜間、中國人之行動實不能認爲關健、</p>
<p>且中國軍隊曾奉到命令、對於日本不得有任何攻擊、此足下所深知者、中國及蘇俄在滿洲亦有其生存關係之利益、而必不能不計及者、世界其餘國家以爲日本承認「滿洲國」、將違反國聨盟約·華府九國條約·及凱洛克非戰條約、「内田」日本對世界輿論及本國在國際關係上所占之地位、均極重視、但爲日本言之、此問題解决之唯一途徑、爲承認「滿洲國」、此日本全國所要求者、「内田答法委克勞特問」滿洲與中國之間、任何連鎖不能任其存在、即理論上之連鎖、亦不能承認、此種連鎖、徒使中國在滿洲恢復其舊日之狀况、固不問連鎖之性質如何、世界國家之認識中國、無過於日本者、中國之諾言、日本亦巳試騐、且中國及蘇聨之在滿洲、常對日本施行攻擊政策、中國一切提議、日本均準備研究、惟中國須知其對滿洲應根本放棄、「滿洲國」一日存在、則日本一日認爲無與中國談判滿洲問題之必要、日本承認「滿洲國」、並不違反九國日約、因滿洲國並非該約之簽字國、假如日本吞併滿洲、則其情形又當别論、「内田又謂」滿洲國之日本顧問、如不滿意、日本將予以撤換、</p>
<h3>第二次談話</h3>
<p>「内田」予謂日本政府可以更換「滿洲國」官吏、實爲錯誤、日本不過能向「滿洲國」保薦較良之新官吏耳、</p>
<p>調查團以日本軍隊之法律上地位、詢問内田、内田答稱、予不深知、須問陸軍省、「意委員馬柯迪伯爵」數世紀以前、滿洲人固曾侵入中國、然至今日、滿人卒爲中國人所同化、「内田答」誠然、但滿洲畢竟存在「李頓」貴國所稱之滿洲、究何所指、其疆界如何、「内田」敝國所稱之滿洲、包括東四省及内蒙古、其疆界如何、目下不能精確說明、凡爾賽條約對於波蘭邊界問題、巳有榜樣、「李頓」然則門户開放主義將如何、「内田」日本在滿洲自然維持此原則、「李頓」日本應根據國聨會原則、和平解决其與中國之爭端、「内田」國聨之所爲、亦不過使中國了然於國聨及任何列强之援助均不可恃、而必須放棄其對滿洲之夢想、而對其他一切爭執問題、則與日本和平妥協、「麥考益」日本宣言願担任維持遠東和平之責任、然日本前後與俄國及中國两次作戰、維持和平之道固如是乎、時至今日、日本又以爲欲盡和平之責、不可不用武力、信如是、則不若聽國聨會以和平方法維持和平、轉較妥善也、「内田」日本對國聨會極爲信仰、但無論如何、日本不能以其所負責任委諸國聨、而滿洲問題、尤非承認「滿洲國」不能解决、此乃確定不易者、　　「内田答李頓問」當中國當局離開滿省洲之後、主持滿洲者、即請日本接管該處之中國鐵路、「李頓」日本在滿洲之權利及利益、以一九零五年及一九一五年條約爲根據、然則此項條約將如何、又謂貴國對於此事、是滞欲與滿洲國訂立特别條約、「内田」答稱此各項條約、在其與滿洲有關係之範圍内、應由「滿洲國」承認之、「李頓」但此項條約中、尙有其他條欵、與中國本身相關者又將如何、中國能否認爲繼續有效、「内田答」此問題尙待研究、日海軍預算總額</p>

<p>同人等亦賞著作敎科圖書、或且曾受傭雇、故呈文中有「同人等或曾任著書工作······洞悉此中情弊······」等語、卽云誅伐、辱詈、亦不過自供自責而巳、且所謂「筆工」「無以爲生」各語、誠如惠函所云「無以爲生、豈亦有關知議知誼、······操筆作工、亦奚慚於傭仰、」目爲辱詈、指爲貶辭不知從何說起至二祇求」「不願」云云、本非指著作人而言、文意甚明以同人經騐言之、編輯敎科書、往往因他方限制支配、「祇求」「不願、」故有雖「嘔心吐血」而結果仍屬不良者、此非著作人之咎、實另有負責者在耳、同人之言、正爲著作人辯白而反指爲誅伐、可謂誤會極矣、</p>

<p>昨戰一比二敗於蘭開夏</p>
<p>蘭隊球藝並無特殊優點</p>
<p>西人足球會甲組會員曁南與英軍蘭開夏两隊、昨日在逸園作友誼比賽、两隊均屬初試身手、故陣容散亂、未見特殊表演、上半時蘭開夏勝两球、下半時曁南梅洪　用極快之射擊、攻入一球、結果曁南以一比二敗北觀者三四千人、</p>
<p>曁南人才頗佳内外平均惟缺少聨絡、實爲美中不足、應多作練習、以謀防禦進攻之策、江善敬與顧尙　之二内衛漏足頗多亟宜避免、前衛極佳徐亞輝前後顚到、恰到妙處前鋒射擊不準野球頗多、更宜留意至於蘭開夏結果雖勝其球藝實未見有勝過曁南之處、</p>
<p>前場大意失两球下午三時曁南得開球之利猛力進攻、錢瑞生得機射門、卽成野球、陳鎭和單槍匹馬盤球前進、衝入無人之境以爲不難一舉成功、詎料撥球過遠、反爲對方守門跑出救出蘭開夏卽興兵還殺、亦籌功而還、曁南羅海光錢瑞生先攻攻門、均未中的混戰至三十五分鐘時、英軍右翼用高球送曁南門前、時陽光逼視守門謝全和之目、球接而失、落英軍左内鋒脚上卽行射門、球復觸隊友中鋒身上、中鋒回身再射球乃入門曁南　負一求、蘭開夏聲勢一振、不五分鐘右翼帶球衝進進　門前、顧尙動擬阻其行動而不得、被其攻入門内、曁南乃負两球、曁南至此元氣大傷、乃急起反抗、羅海光两次頭頂無效、終於無所建樹上半時終了、蘭開夏以二比零勝、</p>
<p>後場小梅建奇功檸檬過後、曁南莊世鴻脚痛休息、由雲逢　代職曁南抱先發制人之志、一鼓作氣、直搗英軍巢穴、陳鎭和違球送左方劉祖侃帶前幾步急射門前球着地滾去、羅海光與英軍左内衛衝上均漏脚球門向右梅洪寳趕上用力一踢、球如離弦之勢射入網窩、其勢銳急清晰之至、觀者讚美不絶、掌聲雷鳴此球進後、英軍又撲向曁南球門中鋒猛射一球、謝全和妙接化險博得觀衆喝采、此後曁南前鋒、並行前進亦時光臨蘭隊球門、攻門之機會不少、可惜野球太多、彼之守門員之穩健無隙可乘、攻守再三、卒均無成績建立、混戰往來、精神色彩時現、結果蘭隊以二比一得勝陣線如下按列、</p>

<p>邱飛海林寳華昨日上海公開雙打决賽中、又告勝利、以直落三擊敗勁敵德孚惠特、保持錦標第三年、成績六比三、八比六六比四、</p>
<h3>草地錦標全部包辦上海草地網</h3>
<p>球會今歲之男子錦標經邱林两君之奮鬥、全部落華人之手、堪稱新紀錄、雖爲两君之光榮、亦吾華人之無上光榮、男子部三大錦標、（一）國際羅伯杯、决賽勝英國德孚惠特、（二）男子單打决賽邱飛海勝上届冠軍德孚、（三）昨日之男子雙打决賽、邱林再勝德孚惠特、</p>
<p>一連五局勢如破竹雙打决賽、繼女子單打决賽之後、四將登場、德孚首先發球、連下四點邱林凈輪一局林寳華繼之發球、以砲彈式之球、亦連得三點、以四比二點、穫得第二局、於是銳不可當、勢如破竹、一連串取得五局、成五與一之比、而以六比二先得第一盤、　　敵勢雖凶反攻再勝第二盤之形勢、因惠特之突然進展、表演驟佳、邱林取首盤甚易、於是漸露鬆懈、對方尺寸進佔、三比二、五比三、竟有奪取第二盤之形勢、林寳華至此奮臂一振、在網前接破德孚之發球局、造成五比四、繼之林發球、連勝四點、惡劣形勢、遂轉成五五平手、對方又以六比五佔先一局、林邱卒再連下三局又以八比六勝第二盤、形勢大定、</p>
<p>再破危局功德圓滿邱林雖二比　　零操有把握、然於此决勝負之第三盤中、敵勢仍然猖獗德孚惠特以三比一、四比二、儼然進逼、第七局勝負關鍵敵得之五比二、邱林得之四比三相去匪鮮、惠特供球、邱林一舉而破之、大勢遂告轉機次局爲林供球、遂一連再下四局、功德圓滿、六比四勝第三盤、</p>
<p>林寳華之網上工夫昨之取勝、恃林之發球、獲分不少、而要之網上工夫、亦爲敵致命之傷、林單打今不能稱覇雙打仍當推重無疑、其清脆有趣味之網前輕敵劈射、使對方徒呼負負、所覺美中不足林邱二人、網前壓殺、尙可用力、未曾令人覺其爽快也、德孚完全减色、其所以能頑强抗拒者、惠特表特、驟然出色之故耳、</p>
<p>邱飛海林寳華連勝公開雙打錦標三年</p>

<p>女單打佛傑士冠軍雙打决賽之前、先有女子單打决賽、两俄國女子傑士夫人對克倫諾夫夫人、佛爲哈爾濱之單打冠軍、克卽上屆冠軍菲絲小姐、故技術上相差甚微、於是紐纏不能解開、佛之正手抽球、異常有力而精彩、獲勝大率在此、結果以二比一盤獲錦標、六比三、八比六、第二盤佛以五比三居先、後以六比八失敗甚惜、</p>

<p>友誼足球賽</p>
<h3>東華大破法商</h3>
<p>結果七對一之比</p>
<p>法商隊陣綫不齊</p>
<p>東華發番　兵、軍容嚴盛、似與往年三育樂華之黄金時代相彷彿、昨與法商隊作友誼與中華棒球塲法商隊本屆甲組隊伍之一、初無藉名、自以三對三和林肯及威德夏以來、人遂括目視之、交鋒之下東華乃以七對一大勝之、勝同意料所及、但高下相差如此、不無驚人、</p>
<p>法商隊大敗之由法商隊昨日之出場應戰者並非正式陣綫如守門福拉若·内衛托台、前衛雷米笛前鋒拉森均缺席、而補以預備軍、如此殘缺隊伍、何能與不可一世之東華爭雄、宜其俯服於東華鐵蹄之下、任人宰割也、　　東華隊以石擊卵東華隊開塲占迎風反日之利、益得運用其所長、大破敵人、四十五分鐘内連獲五球、誠非偶事、下半時之表演、巳非如上半時之急進、或者不欲過於使人難堪耳以石擊卵、可代表當時二隊局勢之一班、</p>
<p>忽然來一塲空驚裁判員陳吉祥鳴笛宣戰、東華頻探敵陣、萬象華最先射門、脚頭不準、越門外出、法商反攻柯萊一球傅中巴山脫與周賢言互冲奪球、周氏倒地球滾向右旁龍門大空、法佛沙過於燥急、打中木柱、彈回再打、又向天空、一塲空驚、幾乎嚇壞觀衆、</p>
<p>五分鐘連下两關東華在劇攻之下、始終流連於對方内衛綫内、未得一逞、二十分鐘巳過、李義臣接得馮運佑之傅遞、飛馬疾入敵陣、一轉眼間、球自李氏而至陳虞添、砰然一聲、敵關失陷、陳虞添揚揚然凱旋而歸矣、不期敵將立行反攻、三四傅遞、中鋒猛然射擊、周賢言早有準備側身倒地、雙手撲外、易以他人、恐難保全、三軍用命、反危爲安、吳幼良帶球外出、傅交前方、李義臣匹馬攻關、又中一球、二球之獲先後不過五分鐘、接後敵方守門犯規、全隊排一字陣相抗、東華遂不得志而退、</p>
<p>上半時成五對一法商隊累試不中仍、未失望先自右方侵入、繼而在中部相爭、足影撩亂之中雷及耳突放暗箭、周氏不及抵　乃告失守、成二對一之比數、法商奪得一球、軍勢反見散漫、李義臣漁翁得利、陳洪光身快脚快、各中一球、休息之前、　開元傅挑得勢、李義臣又中一球、上半時成五對一、</p>
<p>單面倒又加二球下半時觀者興趣、踢者精神、均不及前、良以敵方實力不如我、安能引起緊張之情緒也、陳虞添右陲送來、守門離位挽救、陳洪光起與爭抗、高球下垂、適觸洪光膝頭、乃緩緩向網中滾去、東華乃以六比一占光、以後韶光、两軍均未有特殊長演、最後十分鐘時、陳洪光又以敏捷之脚頭、獨身冲入敵關、造成七對一單面倒之結果、</p>

<h3>籃球新術（七）（不許白爾凱ClaireBurcky原著</h3>
<p>（轉載）張國勳錢一勤合譯</p>
<p>投籃卽籃球比賽之目的若足球之攻門、及棒球之　壘、當球員得將球由其本籃中中自上而下穿過時、卽當計算分數、</p>
<p>每一合法之中籃作爲二分籃球之進攻在使球員設法將球傅近籃底因該處得分之機會、較半場處爲多</p>
<p>罰球所以處罰犯規行爲得自由投籃其對方不得加以阻撓、須於距遮板垂直線下十五呎之距離罰球線上執行、每投中一次以一分計算、</p>
<p>每隊之防守區爲後場其攻擊之目標爲據於對區終點處之本籃、設甲隊擲一球於乙隊籃中、此雖屬罕有之情形則乙隊應得两分、無論誤擲之球員如何道謙終屬無效、</p>

<p>專航東北專行東北安東一路太古舟山輪、上次開出、係在我國宣布封鎖東北海關之前一日、故載去貨物頗多迨船到安東時、僞國以其巳過九月二十五日、乃向之徵收船鈔與進口貨的關稅、可稱僞國宣佈收稅後、上海到安東之第一艘輪船此次由安東運裝大荳雜糧旅客等來滬、經過烟臺、錯行航道、以致失事、</p>
<p>觸礁情形本月一日午夜該輪行抵烟臺洋面、距離烟臺約一海哩之東、地名外島地方、受海面霧露之影響、錯走航道、乃駛入暗礁中、船主發覺有異、欲思退避、而前身巳開入暗礁中、頭艙觸入礁石前艙外舷两旁鋼板、亦被礁石觸破、霎時間便即浸水、</p>
<p>損害狀况觸礁之處、係在船頭下端、艙底亦爲鋒利礁石觸破、海水冲進、幸中艙與引擎間、均各隔絶、尙未波及、但頭艙進水、瞬至八九尺、貨物盡沒水中、苟非礁石擱住、前身早巳下陷海中矣、</p>
<p>船主求救出事時、船主藹文斯、以無法使之脫險、乃急發無線電SOS之求救信號、首先得到警報者、係抛泊在劉公島附近英國軍艦两隻、立即同時開往救護、一面轉電烟臺上海太古總分行、未幾英海軍拖船及小火輪等亦趕到、即協同前行救援工作、决先將船上乘客等駁出、</p>
<p>乘客救起英海軍艦到外島附近、乃放小火輪至舟山船旁、先將輪内全部乘客、逐批駁載交海軍拖輪、其時旅客巳羣集艙面、正驚惶求救間、得英海軍小輪援之出險、深夜工作、全部員客、竟得安然送到烟臺、未有傷害、船主愛文斯聞尙在輪中而海軍巳派拖輪旁靠舟山、並派兵排協同保護、</p>
<p>吳淞得電昨日二時五十分、吳淞無綫電臺、曾接舟山輪船救急電訊、報告該輪在威海衛口外小島擱淺、形勢險惡、請附近輪船、立往援救、</p>
<p>準備拖救上海總公司得訊、以上次新盛京輪在烟臺外擱礁、電請大連日本撈船公司、將其曳救出險、今仍照上次辦法、巳發電至大連撈船公司、速即派拖船及帶同技師工人等駛往拖救、預計今日午刻可至該處、海軍當局、且派潛水夫入海、擬先將船頭下底之破洞修補、然後再設法拖救也、查舟山輪排水量爲二千五百餘噸、海關註册噸爲一千三百三十八噸、此次由安東來滬、貨物以荳子雜糧居多、</p>

<p>丁氏致詞今天華僑聨合會、</p>
<p>在此歡迎僑界巨子陳武烈先生、並其他各位、兄弟得有機會參加、並代致歡迎詞實在是非常愉快與榮幸、我們爲什麽歡迎陳先生呢其理由有三、（一）陳先生是僑胞中最大成功者之一、我們中國人到海外去的很多、自然失敗的也是不知凡幾、陳先生是福建人、在海外甚久、暹羅新加坡都有他的生意、並且甚發達、尤其在暹羅、因他對於暹政府人民有很大的貢獻、故得有侯爵尊號、這是不容易的事啊、「衣錦還鄉」本是一件榮耀與人人羨慕的事、可是陳先生是在海外商業上政治上都有大大的成就、現在歸自海外、這才算眞眞是「衣錦還鄉」、其榮耀非他們僅僅在本國做富者可比、這是值得我們歡迎第一點、（二）他是資本家兼革命家、我們曉得、僑胞中資本家本是很多、因爲環境關、好多就不敢明白表示、或贊助、而陳先生不計成敗、不顧利害、爲拯救衰微之祖國起見毅然參加革命工作、故黨中先進多與他有淵源、而革命之力量因之加强、革命之速度亦因之加快、這是值得我們歡迎的第二點、（三）陳先生尙不斷的繼續努力愛國、現在中國革命總算告一段落、但是國内民生痛苦未見減少、似有加增之傾向、陳先生認定中國政亂之原、由於民生不能安定、要安定民生、又非從開發實業增加生産不可、中國礦産遍地、皆未開採、勞工過剩、不能利用、年年入超、巳達幾萬萬元、如此貨棄於地與利權外溢、國那得不貧、那得不弱、又那得不亂呢、陳先生此次歸來、一方面調查國内資源、以備開發一方面調查國貨、設法推銷於國外、如此分途並進、民生自能向上、國力亦自能提高、陳先生具此宏願與努力、這是值得我們歡迎的第三點、再兄弟去歲曾到南洋、個人有點感想與主張、說出來供各位僑胞的參考、倘蒙採納、不無小補、（一）華僑要團結、我們覺得華僑太散漫、故力量不能集中、力量不能集中故常被人輕視與欺凌、爲何見得他們散漫呢、最大的毛病、就是在外國鬧会麽省界、甚至還要鬧府界縣界、尤其在新加坡有某省會館、又有某縣會館、儼如在國内一樣、應該在海外亦知道一個整個的「中華民國」整個的「中華民族」何必在外國還要鬧地方界限呢、因此帝國主義者、就利用此弱點施以挑撥離間、或設法加强我們的地方觀念、愈使我們不能團結好供　們宰割、兄弟主張、應由中華會館統一之、此外多設俱樂部、以替代各地方的會館、份子不限於某省人、如此感情融洽、自能收團結之效、消極的可以排除外來之侮辱、積極的可以進展本身之事業、與援助祖國（二）要消除僑胞間彼此衝突、同客他鄉爲什麽還會彼此衝突呢、說也奇怪、這也是因爲中國人封建思想太强、兼之派系關係太深、錯綜複雜、此攻彼詰、衝突遂不可免、小則纏訟不巳、互求勝利於居留地政府之一言、（在斐律賓各國僑民中之訟案、日本人最少、中國人最多、）大則互相殘殺、演成慘劇、（如在美華僑之堂鬥）、我們從未看見甲國人在乙國、演同類相殘之事、如我們中國人一樣實在可恥之事、兄弟主張、應由各地黨部·領事館·商會·與中華會館·合組一公判機關、嚴切執行、如此、衝突之事或可减少、（三）擴充與攺良敎育、我們在國内的人、以爲華僑有錢、敎育一定辦得不錯、其實也不盡然、第一人才缺乏、第二經費亦有的不足、第三無統一指導機關、（尤其英屬不能組織統一敎育會）、因爲辦不好、所以僑生子弟、多送入外國學校、去受殖民地敎育、於此將來中華民族與僑胞地位、都大有危險、當僑胞處在各種勢力本地士人歐美並日本之環攻之下、惟一要着自然以促進文化提高知識爲前提否則優勝劣敗、以後恐要歸於淘汰咧、兄弟主張、要設統一指導機關聘國内敎育專家、與當地有聲望者充之、由領事總其成、捐錢者不得干涉學校行政、並應多設中小學、學生畢業後、送歸國内大學肄業、辦中小學易辦大學則難、華僑如認眞辦理、當可容易做到、僑生子弟在本地讀中學、在國内讀大學、則對於祖國情形、不至隔膜、回去亦可領導一切、如此、中國才多一批有力之國民、我們欲團結華僑、欲消除華僑間衝突、均有賴於敎育之攺進、與擴充之、而這種艱巨工作、又非藉有魄力的、有見識的、在社會上有信用的、在政治上有地位的如陳先生這種人、出而組織提倡與糾正不爲功、是則兄弟所厚望於陳先生、並各位僑胞者、</p>
<p>華僑聨合會歡迎陳武烈先生攝會</p>
<p>陳氏答謝今天承華僑聨合會各同志開歡迎會、歡迎鄙人、不勝或謝、但是鄙人對於歡迎两字、實不敢當、可是在這個會塲中、得有機緣、與諸君歡叙一堂眞是三生有幸、剛才許主席所說的話、實在太恭維了、使鄙人汗顔之至、鄙人對於革命工作、雖說我是一個生長海外的僑民、但是向祖國的心、未嘗敢稍落人後、故歷年來於革命事業、不過略盡天職、但求無愧我心、總算是做國民的一份子的責任而巳、絶對談不起「有功」两字、民國元年、我也曾回到祖國一次、當時先總理曾囑我隨遊北平、適因在上海有要事覊身、致未追隨先總理前去、至今引以爲憾、滿想二十年未回祖國、這一番歸來、應該受到較好的印像、却不料事實與思想全非、念年來的中國、仍舊如許腐敗、不禁無限的感觸、鄙人這次的回國、雖然接受不少的刺激、可是從另一方面的觀察、國内的民氣、着實的蒸蒸日上、并且現在的一班執政諸公、大都與鄙人有舊、他們的道德學問、及其昔日辦事的精神、均爲鄙人所欽佩、當以國步困難之際、必能努力一致合作、但當局亦每有國際上環境的關係、往往不克盡展其方、致許多事情不能如願以償、故進步的效果略遲、所以希望我們民族的團結力量、是萬不能稍鬆懈的、時時當學着先總理的大無畏精神、向光明的道上去奮鬥、一舉一動、亦當堅决鎭定、期作我外交的後盾、似此民衆與政府一致協力、共赴國難、我國家必能獲最後的勝利、若能如此、鄙人雖两鬓蒼白、亦願犧牲一切、以隨我國内諸同志之後、所不敢辭、區區私心、想各位均抱有同意也、鄙人國語不粹、大致如此說、最後的一句話、就是日前報載、暹羅華僑六百萬、却由鄙人引進一語、要知道華僑在暹羅、巳有遐遠的歷史、斷乎非鄙人單獨能力所能引進得到的、又此次暹羅革命、說鄙人曾參加等語、這大概巳是誤會了、須知此番暹羅的革命、另有特殊的性質、所以三數日間即告平靜、鄙人雖得有該國的勳位、實際上不過站在僑民的地位、决沒有參加該國政治工作的道理、這幾句話、算是我一個附帶的聲明、謝謝各界同志、</p>

<h3>越界築路案</h3>
<p>日僑向工部局提條件</p>
<p>費信惇尙無表示</p>
<p>上海社云、收回越界築路問題、自工部局總裁費信惇氏返滬與市府秘書長俞鴻鈞氏再度會商後、對於草約原則、雙方業巳表示同意、解决之期當不在遠、惟旅滬日僑方面反對仍形激烈、曾連日在日商俱樂部事務所召開會議、討論應付辦法、結果擬定條件多項、交由工部局日董寺并、轉向費信惇氏提出交涉、並於日内將向工部局作正式表示、</p>
<p>條件内容日僑對於工部局放棄界外馬路提出之條件、内容中最重要者、即爲界外馬路被中國政府收回後、最低限席、日方應保留有自由駐警權一項、其餘則爲居住界外馬路區域内之日僑、永遠不納重稅、及日僑在界外馬路内、得自由建築、不受中國政府干涉等項、亦爲該條件中之次要者、全文固不僅此區區數項、但據日僑意見、上列三項條件、工部局如能予以接受、則其他各項、儘可從長商議、或竟可放棄不提、蓋以上數條、倘能實行後、則越界築路、雖被我方收回、於日人一切額外利益、仍無少損、且不啻越界築路一變而爲是人租界也、</p>
<p>請願經過旅滬日僑自於連日會議席上、對於工部局放棄界外馬路問題、决定提出向該局條件後、當即推定居留民團行政委員長安井等三人爲代表、面向工部局日董寺井遞呈請願書、及所提條件、寺井當即允將該項條件、交工部局總裁費信惇、請其攷慮容納、並囑代表等在居留民團事務所内、靜候答復、</p>
<p>訪費交涉工部局日董寺井、自接受日僑之請願書及條件後、即於前日（三十日）下午、訪工部局總裁費信惇要求費氏對於日僑所提條法、儘量予以考慮容納、惟費氏是日除向寺井詳細解釋收回越界築路草案内容外、對於日僑所提條件、並無任何表示、雙方晤談至三時許、仍無結果、寺井旋即辭出、返居留民團事務所、向日僑報告向費交涉經過、</p>
<p>再召會議日居留民團行政委員長安井、自得寺井報告後、當即分别通知日僑、定於本月八日（星期六）下午五時、在該團事務所再度召開會議、討論更進一步辦法、安井並巳着手草擬向工部局正式提出表示辦法、預備提交八日之會議席上、詳加討論後、由寺井提交工部局總裁費信惇云、</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>白描葑水小茶寮</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>習於城市生活的我，爲着轉移空氣，而往葑門外一家臨水的小茶寮裏面去暫坐片刻。</p>
<p>下午二時！是城外茶寮落市的時候，座中只有三五個附近的農村男女，他們的特殊打扮，是男的戴着毡帽，女的黑布紥額而腦後挽着一個百葉結。</p>
<p>我認爲這其間有適用於白描的材料，便把削的尖銳化的鉛筆在紙片上龐龐地寫··隔座的勞農神聖瞧了我一眼，他不知我寫的什麽，只别轉頭去吸他的黄烟。</p>
<p>我坐在靠近欄干右面臨水的座位，但見隔岸一帶短籬裏面，聳起着十餘本的秋葵花，分歧着雞爪似的離披大葉，上面開着蜜蠟也似的花朶，宛比放大數百倍的素心蠟梅··可惜花開時沒人欣賞，欣賞它的只有我這枝尖銳化的鉛筆｜</p>
<p>仰着頸兒在河灘上涉足的幾頭白鵡，大有昻頭天外目空一切的樣子；忽有三五隻鴨子很閒暇的浮波而來，羣鵝都撲開着两柄白羽扇，鶃鶃的連喚三聲··究竟鵝在歡迎鴨子呢？還在厭惡鴨子？也許是鶃鶃三呼，等於軍籃上所放的禮砲，作爲水上相逢的敬意；但沒有通禽語的公冶長來作證人。　　城外的河水，畢竟比城中寛廣而清澈；幾隻茭白船搖過去了，又有幾隻載人的駁船搖來攏岸··其中搭客，十之七八是頸套黄布香袋的燒香婦女。　　我見了這怪模怪樣不禁暗地笑，笑伊們打不開這迷信的門，忽又笑起自己來了；迷信神佛等於迷信科舉，三十餘年前赴貢院去應試的我，頸項裏也套着一隻和香袋一般大小的卷袋，簡直和燒香婦女一般的怪模怪樣。</p>
<p>冷靜茶寮裏忽的熱閙起來，駁般裏的燒香婦女都到茶寮裏來打尖；我的座位被擠了！只好付了茶錢八銅元遜位而去。</p>
<h3>東三省失地？</h3>
<p>— 里·元</p>
<p>｜怎麽不知道｜</p>
<p>窒暗君；你不要一洗帚打殺十八只蟑螂，駡盡我中國人都不知道東北失地的里數了！我却能清清爽爽說出里數，還你的娘家寳門，但我確不是親到東三省去調查的，亦不是書本上看來的，是一個輿地專家華民君告訴我。我前日在報上看見，外交部爲日本承認僞組織事致十二國照會中，有「日本以武力奪取中國約四十萬方里之土地，復不顧友邦之勸告，正式承認其在該地一手造成之非法組織，」一般人以爲外交部之公文，總不差的，東北失地，一定是四十萬方里了，但我猶懷疑，腦筋中，記得尙不止此數，因舉以問我友人華民君，華民君說；外交部所舉的數目不對，我告訴你聽，我國實測的輿地上，明明說遼寗省面積八六五○○○方里；吉林省面積八八二、○○○方里；黑龍江面積一、七八五、○○○方里··你去算罷。熱河姑且不論，即東三省地方，不巳有三、五三二、○○○方里的面積嗎？彼以武奪我東三省去的日本，他在拿到手之前，亦早巳細細代我算過，他所刋行之地圖上，說遼寗省面積五五一、七九○方里，吉林省面積七二七、三五二方里；黑龍江面積一、七五六、九七○方里；是照彼計算，東三省亦有三、○三六、一一二方里；外交部所舉數目四十萬的十字，如係百字之誤，則馬馬虎虎，差得好些哩。不然，差得太遠了！</p>
<p>華民君所說如此，可知我中國人，正多關心東北失地，正多知道失地的里數哩。</p>
<h3>臥薪嘗膽</h3>
<p>— ·碧·城</p>
<p>｜究竟作何解釋｜</p>
<p>自國難日亟以來，一句臥薪嘗膽的古話，見諸通電，聞諸演說，幾於無時不在人心目中；乃歷經考騐，一班通電的人，演說的人，他自己依舊睡的錦被繡褥，吃的山珍海錯，沒有一些臥薪嘗膽的沈痛意味。頃聞人轉述馬二先生的新解釋··他道我們中國人的所謂臥薪，乃是不要做事體，可以得到錢的代名詞；蓋高臥而支薪俸耳。不過馬二先生又說嘗膽两字，他還沒有研究出來，當作何解？我道這更不難得到一個確解了｜簡直說··就是嘗試有了膽量；不問什麽事，多敢做了。從前人不是有两句話？一句呌做量而後入，一句呌做知難而退。這明明是沒有嘗試的膽量，所以他要望而郤步。如今的人，都是懷着萬能的本領；那一件事不敢嘗試？那一件事沒有膽量去做？你想高臥支薪俸，只要嘗試有膽量｜這就呌做臥薪嘗膽。</p>
<h3>時事新辭源</h3>
<p>— ·才·良</p>
<p>安内攘外此謂欲安内部，必先攘出局外人而後可。</p>
<p>長期抵抗此謂須俟長期屈服之後，始有抵抗可言也。　　相當處置此謂我失彼得而能相當，則處境惟有置諸不問也。</p>
<p>嚴重抗議此謂國難旣如是嚴重，則抵抗惟有借重於議論文字。</p>
<p>共赴國難此謂共謀享受權利而赴之惟恐或後，斯國難之所以愈擱（諧音國）愈難。</p>
<p>整個計劃此謂東省巳整個喪失，則計其將來，必須劃地以圖偏安。</p>
<p>澈底解决此謂日人而能安獲東省，則列强皆將援例，恐我國土雖大，必有澈决解决之一日。</p>
<h3>京滬速寫</h3>
<p>— ·潛</p>
<p>｜两方的對比｜</p>
<p>我近來因事到南京走了一趟，就一日間耳目之所見聞，作京滬速寫··</p>
<p>（一）南京好像有些在學上海，試看大路旁的洋房子，和走道上拂髮的女子，便可知了。</p>
<p>（二）南京的洋房子好像要傾向於擁擠了。不要幾年，我恐怕南京的住宅又成了上海的鴿子籠，那眞苦哉。</p>
<p>（三）上海洋氣太重，路上盡是西裝··南京官氣太重，路上盡是斜皮帶·洋氣太重則流爲「奴」·官氣太重則流爲「腐·」</p>
<p>（四）南京的機關特别多！「X師駐京辦事處」幾乎觸目皆是·每處便是一座洋房·我想頂好連合在一起，旣便接洽，又省建築費·</p>
<p>（五）外國汽車行，洋行，巍峨的立在道路两邊·中國自己的工廠呢？無從去找！所以我所希望南京的，是革除官氣，和努力作科學上的建設·</p>

<p>内中的情形也不甚單調，成有家室養有眷屬的同事們，也有臨時把夫人的來，並詑著孩子，在此一同散步的；看他們的神態，倒還非常的蕭適。又有一般未婚的少年，正在人生所必經的愛情的程途上追求女性，也認識了一此女友，或進一步巳成爲愛侶，一樣也約會著到了這裏·作一番清游，談一番喁喁的情話。那一種卿卿我我極度熱戀的表現，便更陪襯出這幽寂的公園，是與天國的樂園同其美麗，半點也不覺得枯燥和凄清了。</p>
<p>這時，有一個年方弱冠的青年，却獨自躑躅在那亭子的左右附近，並不住的向四面瞭望，似在尋找什麽人？可是候了好一陣，始終不曾離開那亭子，又好似是約定了什麽人在這處指定的地點相叙，不能擅自走開。計從四點半鐘到這徘徊起，巳期待有两小時以上的光陰了。遠望著郵政局鐘樓的指針·隱約地像巳走到六點五十幾分，所盼望的人還是未見來，這青年就等候得有些煩燥了。有時斜倚到亭柱邊，將一雙手托着下頦在俯首沈思；有時又跑到草地上搔首抓腮的來回亂轉；偶成諦視着過往的游客，見有女性們作女學生裝束的，似乎特别的注意。驀然間如發見了一個，像是他所渴盼的人，喜孜孜急忙忙赶了去一細看，却立時證明了是出於誤認，搖著頭紅着臉很怏悵的走開，還不禁深深地吐一口寃氣。</p>
<p>後來，大概七點鐘也打過了。他繼續表演了這許多回徒勞而又可笑的舉動，精神巳攪擾得極不安定，同時軀體上也感覺着異常的疲乏，垂頭喪氣的坐到亭子邊一處矮木欄上，漸漸肯定了一個自信的判斷，這時候不來，今天是不會來的了！不過這不來的原因，又仍是多方面的複雜，病了麽？臨時發生了什麽阻碍麽？居心要失信於我，有了意外重大的變端麽？種種問題，似他所搔的頭髮一般亂，仍使他很費一番焦思。</p>
<p>忽然，腦杓子後面，像被一塊磚頭輕敲了一下；正待轉過面來，而耳朶眼裏巳鑽進了一段極熟溜與極甜蜜的笑語聲··</p>
<p>「㕭！你在這等得發急了罷？對不住，我實在被一點旁的事絆住了；但早晚我總是要來的。」</p>

<h3>請看两臺好戲</h3>
<p>— ·佛</p>
<p>東三省正如被暴徒謀財害命，而家人不敢前往收屍成殮，而反令暴徒發喪訃告，眞是怪狀，家人無法辦理，惟有報告警局，而警局亦不敢前去緝拿，祇派幾名得力警士，到出事地點查勘查勘，更是可憐，日本之承認僞滿洲國，無異替我國發喪，調查團報告國聨，無異警士查案之後，去報告總避，</p>
<p>在這種嚴重事態之下，而家中遂大演其拿手好戲，東有韓復榘與劉珍年之衝突，西有劉文輝與劉湘之火併，現在東臺的武劇，雖將閉幕而還未閉幕，西臺的武劇·又正在開鑼·假令两臺的好戲，只有如公開發表（如韓劉通電等等）者而止，則其事還易消弭，萬一其中尙有别種複雜原因，則更覺不堪設想，他人駡我國祗有門前两隻石獅子乾凈，現在還要戲醜給人家藉口·給傍人笑話的資料，正是是何居心，</p>
<p>我們這些藝員，眞是藝員，祗能在中國的舞臺上，耀武揚威，短拳跳打，一旦被看客喝倒采，或被看客搗亂起來，便溜之大吉，躱在幕後不敢出來，試問這種藝員，有甚麽價值，只好給人家做消遣品，謝謝罷，你們藝員先生的力量，如馬桶蓋上點火，亦得見亮了，不必再來獻醜罷，</p>
<p>國聨應爲自己利益起見，不甘一塊大肉，被日人一日吞下，破壞其機會均等政策，還出來說幾句公道話，萬一絶無關係，早巳「閉門推出窗前月·不管他家瓦上霜」了，現在國聨調查團的報告書，雖巳於昨日公布了，據說（草此文時尙未公布）報告書的内容，其結論大致主張主權歸還中國，日本得經濟開發權，我想就是這個主張，以虚名歸還我國，以實利讓給日本，中國亦安用此虚名爲，併且日本口口聲聲，强硬對付，即此種遷就政策，日本還不肯領情呢，</p>
<p>我現在痛快，乾脆地說，我國朝野上下，不要再醉生夢死，不要再去希望國聨了，情願做亡國奴的，馬上掮了順民旗，擔簞壺漿·到關外去歡迎日本人，如不願意做亡國奴的，則「寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全」，苟有一兵一卒，一槍一彈，爽爽快快同日人去幹個你死我活，死要死得痛快，活要活得痛快，不要蘇州人繞辮子，「只聽見小姐脚步響不看見小姐下樓來，」使人心癢難熬，看看東北的養勇軍，何等勇敢，何等努力，我們只好戴了糊面子，躱在家中羞死，讓一般義勇軍去出風頭，</p>
<p>諸位亦曾聽見唐紹儀先生的話麽？他說「國聨有什麽合法與不合法，只有拳頭硬是合法，」</p>

<h3>人體的研究</h3>
<p>— ·愼·永</p>
<p>在這科學的一欄裏，我們巳經看了不少物理化學的作品，但是對於人的生理衛生一方面却很少討論，所以我把人類的身體作一個科學的分析，並且再把大概的衛生方法談一談。</p>
<p>人體在外觀上的部分，誰都可以明瞭，分頭，軀幹和四肢三部，頭部附帶的有耳目口鼻等五官，胸腹屬於軀幹一部，四肢即分爲上肢和下肢。</p>
<p>至於這許多部分，是什麽成功的呢？那末就要考究化學成分了，原來人體的主要元素是碳（Carleon），氣（Oxygen），氫（Hydrogen），（Nitrogen），燐（Phospborus），和硫（Sulbhur）六種，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>此外呢，還有溴，氯，鉀，鈉，鎂，鈣，鐵等等，構民，成功人體上各部分的有機物（OrganicSubstances，和無機物（InorganicSubstances，所謂有機物呢，就是製造細胞的蛋白質（Protein），保護體温維持活動力的指肪（Fats）和碳水合物（Carhohydrate），無機物呢，就是帶滋養料和排洩的水分（Watei），還有鹽類（Saits）也是骨頭·肉和血液的重要成分。</p>
<p>現在要講的就是普通衛生營養人體的方法了，以上所說的各種成分就是維持生活力的要素，長久了，就要消耗完的，所以人體的發育和生長，維持活動力，必須要從外界添補去，並且要保持生長發育循常例而不失常態，又必須要種種方法，且把各條分述如下··</p>
<p>第一每日按定時有適當能補充人體各成分的食物，如　類，卵，乳，豆，蔬菓及水菓等，分量尤須分配適當。　　第二保護消化器官，多刷牙，不食過冷過熱及過分酸酣的東西以保全健全的牙齒·更勿暴飲暴食，而要充分睡眠和運動以保護胃腸。</p>
<p>第三維持循環器的衛生，切勿飲酒吸烟而更以充足運動和按摩沐浴，使血液循環有序。</p>
<p>第四多吸新鮮空氣，吸取氧氣，所以室内宜多開窗户，而多作户外運動。</p>
<p>第五對於排泄器，也不能不有相當的注意，不可免强忍小便和大便，不可多食香辛奮興的飲料，以致能不傷害腎臟的健康，還要保持皮膚的清潔，使能使新陳代謝的作用（Metabolism）經營有序了。</p>
<p>若能照以上幾條普通的規則做去，就能好好的生長發育，自身就不怕有意外｜生病等事情生的發生，不過最後還得加上，要竭力設法預防和隔絶外界傅染病的侵入，那末才不致發生什麽危險了。</p>

<h3>整頓學校納費之提議</h3>
<p>— ·岩·野</p>
<p>自敎育貴族化，窮人的子弟，望校門而興嘆··且與校等級愈高，他的門限也愈高，阻碍敎育，莫此爲甚，試打開與校的章程，看他的納費一覽表，分門别類，名目繁多，計有··（一）與費，（二）膳費，（三）宿費，（四）書籍或講養費，（五）圖書館費，（六）實騐費，（七）基金，（八）保證金，（九）雜費，（十）體育費，固然不是每一個學校都有這十種費，但是全收的却不在少數，我以爲這許多種費，都應由主管機關努力整頓，　貢芻蕘，以備採納。</p>
<p>（一）學費，記得敎育部對於各級學校的學費，曾有規定，小學生以不納學費爲原則，而得視地方情形，酌量收取，但亦有限止，（爲數甚微，似一學期一生僅納二三元，確數巳記不清，手頭又無可查考）今小學校學生在一學期中，有納學費多至二十餘元者，同是市立小學，也有的祇收二三元，有的多至十餘元，中學以上學校，數額不一律，任意增高，予取予求，我以爲主管機關對於公立學校，應參照部並視地方情形，定一折中數目，令各校一律照辦，私立學校以無公欵補助，則爲他們另定一個標準，較公立的加四五成，如有私行增加的，查出立予懲處。</p>
<p>（二）膳費學校對於膳費，實是生財之道，譬如本學期九月一日開學，到一月底爲止，共五個月，中間除去暑期寒假等，實際在校至多四個月，而所繳膳費，須三十多元，平均每月須八九元，各校給學生吃的東西，類多不到此數，且以人多關係，其中更有便宜處，所以有的學校，每月在這膳費上，就有數百元的好處，校長想獨吞，敎員想分肥，弄成風潮，此後敎育主管機關應令各校將所餘之錢，分還學生，以輕學生負担。</p>
<p>（三）書籍及講養費學校向書局大批購書，例有折扣，應以折扣之價，賣給學生，不可賣實價；他如草簿律墨，也絶不可以在學生頭上括削一文，現在書價一年昻貴一年，學校更宜顧念各生家長之負，至於講義費，也當從實計價，不可收了人家半元或一元，發了數十張紙就算完事，如多收，准學生向敎育主管機關報告，而予以制裁。</p>
<p>（四）寄宿費寄宿費須視該校所在地之房租情形並及一生所佔之地位等而定，嘗見某校小小一間屋，共睡十餘人，床與床相接，連行道也幾乎沒有，空氣更惡濁不堪，而每學期倒要收每人十五元的宿費。</p>
<p>（五）圖書館費圖書館爲學校中不可少的設備，理應由校中出欵購書，如以經費支絀，而向學生收費，則當把所收的費，盡用於購書，譬如五百學生，每人每學期收圖書費两元，則得一千元，一年就两千元，以此類推，爲數驚人，年年添購，眞可以汗牛充揀了，然觀其圖書館，則僅小小一間，書也有限，有名無實，敷衍門面，以大部分圖書費，移爲其他用途，或竟飽入私囊，所以主管機關當注意他所收的費，是否與所購的書相稱。</p>
<p>（六）實騐費實騐室和圖書館同樣重要，各校每多借實騐之名歛錢，而購少許標本儀器及藥品等，敷衍學生，主管機關，也當視其所收之費，是事與所購之物相稱。</p>
<p>（七）基金各校每多借建築校舍之名，向學生徵收基金，實則類多移作他用，主管機關應令其存入指定之銀行，保管生息，如不遵令，則勒令他退還學生，而下學期不准再收。</p>
<p>（八）保證金學校每向學生收五元或十元保證金，說是作損毁校中器具物品之賠償金·我想一個學生他在校損壞了五元十元以内的東西，决不至於逃走，實無須此押櫃式的證金·假使他損壞或偷去數百千元的東西而逃走了，則收他區區之五元十元，又能抵補什麽呢？</p>
<p>所以這保證金主管機關應令各校取消·　　（九）體育費體育設備，也同圖書館實騐室一樣應由學校負担，嘗見許多學校，操塲上祗有個籃球架及跳高架和幾個皮球，而體育費則每生每學期必收两元·所以主管機關，也應嚴令他把所收的費，盡用於設備上。</p>
<p>（十）雜費學生在校所用洗面沐浴之水及考試之卷紙等，皆由學校供給，所以每人須出幾角或幾元的雜費·然有的學校，竟考試須學生出錢購紙，沐浴須學生出錢泡水，眞是剥削到極點了·他們出了許多的學膳宿等費，難道連這些都不肯奉送？所以這雜費應令各校取消·</p>
<p>除上述的十種外，還有什麽學生會費，刋物費，畢業證書費等等，也都在應取消之列，各地的敎育當局，能把各校納費努力整頓，則第一，敎育效率必大有增進，第二，營業式的學校不加取締而自關門了·第三，各學生家長的負担，也多少好輕些·一舉三得，願各地的地方，希望本會同人批評，討論·</p>

<h3>悔氣</h3>
<p>— ·彤</p>
<p>平時大家相見都是像青春少婦似的有說有笑，開心得很。近幾天來，眞是有些風不順，余君總是蹙着眉頭，連一句話都不響，如果三番五次的追問，他只是勉强做着悶笑。</p>
<p>余君很喜歡修飾，從頭上到脚底，無論什麽時候，總是光光的亮亮的，整整齊齊的，但是從來不知煩惱的他，三個月中間沒有一封掛號信，向人家去開口是不夠面子的事，因此由窘迫而發生了極度恐慌，每天只吃幾個大餅，一個銅板開水，一次被二房東看見，面頰立刻發起火來，竟一句敷衍的話都沒有了。</p>
<p>大約好多天沒看報了。早晨爬起便跑到道上買份申報，特别是好幾天來二房東太太，一吃了早飯便穿得花花綠綠跑出去。到下午四五點鐘時滿載而歸，「各種貨物都再便宜沒有了，這機會如果失掉，眞是該死｜哈哈｜」二房東太太的笑語裏，滿溢着興奮，使他心癢不過，再大的犧牲，非買份報看它個水落石出。他熱心的一欄一欄的讀着廣告，「買一送一」四個字像魔一樣的在眼簾下誘惑，申報紙落在他脚底下，身體好像木鷄站着不動，一轉身把自己抛在籐椅裏。「眞混蛋，爲什麽這多天還不把錢寄來，倒霉！」他自言自語的說，</p>
<p>整個下午，他滿腔沸騰的怒氣寫了一封快信去付郵。從郵局回來以後，每天都默禱那綠衣使者很快地訴他所熱望的消息。眞的，掛號信收到了，余君的面孔處處都暗含着得意的微笑，夜幕遮避大地的時候，他匆匆地跑出來，留宿在上海。第二天他醉醺醺地跑到我家裏，依然一句話不響坐在床上，两眼呆視着地板。我奇怪了，平時他不大喜歡吃酒，今天的情形眞令人莫明此中糊塗。</p>
<p>「媽的，眞害死我｜前幾天多好，」</p>
<p>每個公司都「大减價··」現在，我的錢寄來，它却不，不减了｜」</p>
<p>「你爲什麽爲吃這多酒呢？眞開心呀｜」我沒有注意他的話所以這樣問他。他聽了我的話有些怒意，停了一下說··</p>
<p>「我要買的東西不是賣光了，就是不減價了，·······哼！這樣開心還不吃酒嗎？」他開門走出去，我問他那裏去，他不應。最後，两句短語，回答我的追問</p>
<p>「悔氣！悔氣！······」</p>
<p>無生路</p>
<h3>失業者的悲哀</h3>
<p>— ·音</p>
<p>李家少奶奶現在眞是焦急，怔忡的情懷，簡直使她坐立不安。她两次三番的在窗口瞻望，希望能看見自己的丈夫很快樂的回來。</p>
<p>當然，自己的丈夫失業，巳是一年多了，現在僥倖有機會能夠去某公司接洽他的職務，在她以爲眞是一天大的希望了。那末，成功與否，俱在這一次接洽之中，這接洽是如此重要，怎麽不使她爲着擔心又是一次失敗而過分焦急呢？而且這是和許多次一樣在報上看着啓事耐　骈應徵的，不過許多次都是失敗，就連回信也沒有一紙，可是現在却是接着了某公司約去談話的回信而去的，這多少總有點靠得住吧。但是一次两次的失敗，許多次的失敗，難道現在保得準不再失敗一次嗎？這次失敗仍是可能的啊。｜所以，這正值得李家少奶奶十分怔忡。</p>
<p>最後，丈夫畢竟是回來了。當他進門的時候，好瘋狂般迎上去，讓丈夫緊緊的抱着而且吻着自己的嘴唇。其後看着他眼睛裏充滿了快樂的光輝，呼吸急促的說∶</p>
<p>「現在我們有了四十塊錢一月了」。　　「啊？事情接洽好了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，在寫字間裏，四十元一月。」</p>
<p>於她快樂得說不出話來，又是緊抱着狂吻。</p>
<p>「但是還有一個難問題啊！」這是丈夫說··</p>
<p>「什麽事？」於是妻又呆了。</p>
<p>「你聽我告訴你··他來信不是約我十點鐘去嗎？可是我一那裏的時候，還只有九點半，於是我爲了遵守他所約定的時間，不能過早，便在附近的馬路上來回的走着，看着那遠處的大自鳴鐘剛剛指着十點，便向公司走去。（當時我想到假如我的那只掛錶沒有當，那便不至於來得過早·）可是那位當差的說「經理還不曾來，」冷冷的對我的身上看了幾眼，敎我在一個角落裏等着，當然我只得低聲下氣的等待。當時我想大概是經理的錶有了毛病，事則或不會遲得所約定的時間這末久的罷。一直到快十一點鐘了，才有一個當差的領着我跨進那高大的房間。那經理是一個大塊頭，簡直是漫畫上的人物，相形之下，我顯得十分渺小。他在我身上仔細的看了一遍，然後板起臉孔說··「你能夠寫生意上的信扎嗎？」當然我說··「會的」，而且告訴他從前在什麽地方辦過事。其後他說··「好的，你就在這裏試辦两個月罷。不過這裏的報酬很少，月薪四十元，不供膳宿，工作每天十小時，並且要先繳保證金一百元，不然，有殷實的商號担保也可以。」當然，我得告訴他有許我因難，其後總算他特别通容，先去辦事，以後再補舖保去。你看，這不是一個困難問題嗎？你敎我們那裏去找保呢」？</p>
<p>「那末怎樣呢？」她說··</p>
<p>「沒有辦法。······不過我想萬一無法的時候，還是先讓他扣去两個半月的月薪罷。」</p>
<p>「那末我們拿什麽吃飯住房子呢？」　　「是的呀！······」</p>
<p>李家少奶奶是深深的嘆氣，丈夫更是嘆氣。</p>
<p>這使她和他對於現代社會增加仇恨不少。</p>
<p>他們更進一步的領會到失業者的悲哀。</p>

        <h1>1932.10.03</h1>
<h3>Chapter 1: A Summary of Recent Chinese Developments</h3>
<p>A crucial element governing China is its gradual modernization. Today's China is a nation in evolution, with all aspects of its national life exhibiting transitional phenomena. Political turbulence, internal strife, social and economic instability, and the consequent weakness of the central government, are all unique characteristics of China since the 1911 Revolution. These circumstances negatively impact nations interacting with China and will continue to threaten world peace and contribute to global economic recession until rectified. This chapter briefly outlines the process leading to these phenomena, including the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, the state of affairs in the early years of the Republic, the internal wars and political tides between 1914 and 1928, Sun Yat-sen's establishment of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), the establishment of the Nanjing central government in 1927, the competition between the central government and its opposition, the growth of Communism in China, and the conflicts between the central government and its party organizations in southern China, all with succinct descriptions.</p>
<p>From this brief account, it is evident that divisive forces still hold sway in China. The reason for this lack of cohesion is that most of the populace prioritizes family or local allegiances over national identity, except when China faces extreme crises. While some leaders have broken free from this narrow-mindedness, genuine national unity requires a national consciousness among the majority of the populace. Furthermore, Communism in China differs from its form in other countries. In China, Communism is not merely a political doctrine adhered to by members of existing parties, nor is it simply a special party organization vying for power against other political factions. Instead, the so-called Communist Party in China is an active opponent of the National Government. Moreover, the disturbances stemming from Communist warfare are exacerbated by China's difficult internal restructuring phase. The complications were further intensified last November by significant external threats. The Communist problem in China is inextricably linked to a larger issue: the reconstruction of the nation.</p>
<p>During this inevitable period of political, social, intellectual, and moral disarray, China's transition may disappoint friendly nations and incite animosity, posing a threat to peace. However, the investigative team believes that despite these difficulties, delays, and failures, China has made considerable progress. A comparison between China's current state and that of 1922 reveals this to be true. The central government's authority remains weak in some provinces, but its central power is not denied, or at least not overtly so. If the central government can maintain this, the administration, military, and finances of the provinces can gradually be nationalized. In short, while there have been failures in the government's restructuring efforts, it has also achieved much.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese nationalism is a legitimate phenomenon during this transitional era. When a nation's people awaken to national unity, they naturally desire external liberation. In China, this desire is amplified and colored by the Kuomintang's strong anti-foreign sentiments. This chapter details the essential demands encompassed by Chinese nationalism and the attitudes of various nations toward these demands, especially regarding the relinquishment of consular jurisdiction and its relationship to maintaining legal order in China. China had already embarked on the path of resolving its difficulties through international cooperation at the Washington Conference. Had it continued to follow this path, significant progress would have been achieved in the decade since the Washington Conference. Unfortunately, progress was hindered by fervent anti-foreign propaganda. Economic boycotts and the aggressive introduction of anti-foreign propaganda into schools contributed to the unique atmosphere at the time of this incident.</p>
<p>Japan, as China's closest neighbor and largest customer, naturally suffered greater losses from China's prevailing conditions than other nations. However, while this issue impacts Japan more severely, it is not merely a Sino-Japanese problem. If the current extreme international conflict can be satisfactorily resolved by the League of Nations, China may believe in the benefits of international cooperation, a policy that originated in Washington and had a remarkably positive impact in 1922.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Situation in Manchuria and Its Relations with Other Parts of China and Russia.</p>
<p>This chapter describes the general situation in Manchuria before September 1931 and its relations with other parts of China and Russia. It refers to the Three Eastern Provinces as a vast and fertile region, largely undeveloped forty years ago, with a sparse population. It is vital to resolving China and Japan's population surplus issues. Millions of impoverished people from Hebei and Shandong provinces have migrated to the Three Eastern Provinces, while Japan has imported its industrial goods and capital into Manchuria in exchange for food and raw materials. Without Japanese activity, Manchuria could not have attracted and absorbed such a large population. Without the continuous influx of Chinese farmers and laborers, Manchuria could not have developed so rapidly. Although Manchuria desperately needs cooperation, it initially became a region of competition between Japan and Russia and later a conflict zone between China and its two powerful neighbors, for reasons previously mentioned.</p>
<p>Initially, China made little effort to develop Manchuria, almost allowing Russia to have jurisdictional rights there. Even after the Treaty of Portsmouth reaffirmed China's sovereignty over Manchuria, the world saw the economic activities of Japan and Russia in the Three Eastern Provinces as more significant than China's. Meanwhile, the migration of millions of Chinese farmers guaranteed that the area would forever belong to China. While Russia was committed to dividing spheres of influence, Chinese farmers occupied the land, making Manchuria's belonging to China an immutable fact. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, China began to actively manage and develop the Three Eastern Provinces. In recent years, it has even planned to reduce Japan's influence in southern Manchuria. This policy has intensified conflicts, culminating in the September 1931 incident.</p>
<p>This chapter also describes the policies and governance of Manchuria during the Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang eras. Zhang Zuolin repeatedly declared independence from the Beijing government, but these declarations did not indicate that Zhang or the people of Manchuria wished to separate from China. His troops entering the pass cannot be compared to foreign invasions but were merely participating in internal warfare. Throughout all wars and periods of independence, Manchuria remained entirely Chinese territory. Although Zhang Zuolin did not support Kuomintang ideology, he deeply hoped for China's unification. His policies regarding the spheres of influence of Japan and Russia prove that he would eliminate the power of both countries if he could. He was almost successful in dealing with the Soviet sphere of influence and promoted the construction of railways, which severed the connections between the South Manchuria Railway and its food supply regions. After Zhang Zuolin's mysterious assassination, Zhang Xueliang disregarded Japan's advice and became more closely connected with Nanjing and the Kuomintang. In December 1928, he declared allegiance to the central government. In reality, the military rule in Manchuria remained as corrupt as before. However, under the influence of the Kuomintang, party propaganda and anti-Japanese activities intensified.</p>
<p>Before September 1931, the investigative team received significant complaints about the widespread abuse of private individuals, bureaucratic corruption, and administrative failures in the Three Eastern Provinces. However, these conditions were not unique to the Three Eastern Provinces. Similar situations existed, and sometimes were worse, in other parts of China. Despite the administrative problems mentioned above, some places in China have made efforts to improve administration with considerable success, especially in education, municipal administration, and public utilities. It is particularly noteworthy that during the Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang eras, the Chinese people and interests in Manchuria, the development and organization of its economic resources, made significant progress compared to the past.</p>
<p>This chapter also narrates the various stages of Russian and Manchurian developments after the signing of the contract for the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the alliance agreement in 1896. The leasing of the Liaodong Peninsula to Russia in 1898, Russia's occupation of Manchuria in 1900, the Russo-Japanese War and the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the impact of the allied intervention in Russia from 1918 to 1920 on Manchuria, the Sino-Soviet agreement of 1924, the events following Zhang Zuolin's aggressive policies against Soviet interests, the Soviet military invasion of northern Manchuria in 1929, and the Treaty of Khabarovsk in December 1929, which restored the status quo between China and Russia, are all described one by one. Finally, the relationship between Japan and Russia regarding the Manchurian issue after 1905 is explained.</p>
<p>The policy of coordination between Japan and Russia in Manchuria from the Treaty of Portsmouth to the Russian Revolution ended due to the Russian Revolution and the Allied intervention in Siberia. In addition, the Soviet government's attitude gave strong excitement to Chinese national aspirations. Japan believes that the Soviet government will support China's struggle to restore sovereignty. This development made Japan's old concerns about Russia recur. The possibility of dangerous entry beyond the northern Manchurian border often makes Japan unable to forget. The connection between the northern Communist doctrine and the southern Kuomintang anti-Japanese propaganda made Japan desire to intervene between the two with a Manchuria unrelated to both. In recent years, the expansion of Soviet power in Outer Mongolia and the development of the Chinese Communist Party have increased Japan's concerns.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Sino-Japanese Disputes Regarding Manchuria Before September 18, 1931</p>
<p>This chapter narrates the main disputes between China and Japan in Manchuria before September 18, 1931. In the past twenty-five years, Manchuria and the rest of China have become increasingly closely linked. At the same time, Japan's benefits in Manchuria have also gradually increased. Manchuria's being a part of China is self-evident. However, within this part, Japan has extraordinary rights, and the exercise of these rights restricts China's sovereignty to such an extent that China and Japan cannot avoid conflicts. These rights are based on the Sino-Japanese Treaty on Matters Concerning the Three Eastern Provinces, which was concluded following the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Treaty of 1915, the so-called Twenty-One Demands, and various railway contracts. Reviewing the outline of these rights reveals the extraordinary nature of the political, economic, and legal relations between China and Japan within Manchuria. Such a situation is unparalleled in the world. It is almost unique for one country to enjoy such extensive economic and administrative rights within the territory of a neighboring country. This situation can only be maintained without causing constant disputes under two conditions: one is that it arises from the free will and agreement of both parties to bear it, and the other is that it arises from a detailed consideration of cooperation policies between both parties in economic and political matters. Otherwise, the result cannot avoid conflict.</p>
<p>This chapter also narrates the conflict of fundamental interests between China and Japan in Manchuria, as manifested in the attitudes and policies of the two governments in the years before September 1931. China recognizes Manchuria as a source of food and the front line of national defense, while Japan's attitude is different. Japan demands special rights in Manchuria. The associations of past history and emotions, strategic prejudices, economic interests, patriotic ideas, national defense psychology, and special rights on treaties all create Japan's demand for Manchuria's special status. This requirement conflicts with China's sovereignty and with the National Government's efforts to reduce</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>The special rights currently held by foreigners and to curb the expansion of these rights in the future are also incompatible.  Among the Japanese, the demand for special interests has an explanation, requesting that Japan has the right to intervene when necessary for the sake of maintaining peace and order in Manchuria.</p>
<p>This fundamental conflict of attitudes and policies between the two sides led to various specific disputes between the two authorities regarding the interpretation and application of the complex treaties that were valid or considered valid. Some of the more important of these disputes are analyzed and listed in this chapter, such as disputes over the parallel lines issue in the Sino-Japanese Treaty on Matters Concerning the Three Eastern Provinces in 1905, disputes over various railway contracts, and disputes over the Treaty of 1915, such as the rights of Japanese people to reside in and lease land for business in Manchuria, administrative power within the South Manchuria Railway Zone, the exercise of certain powers by consular police, and the status of Korean people. By 1931, relations between China and Japan became increasingly tense. The Wanbaoshan Incident, the anti-Chinese riot in Korea, and the killing of Captain Nakamura occurred in connection with each other, which was not accidental.</p>
<p>By the end of August 1931, the relationship between China and Japan regarding Manchuria was extremely tense due to various disputes and unfortunate incidents. The two sides had reasonable grounds for their disputes and attempted to resolve the various problems using the usual diplomatic methods. However, due to prolonged delays, Japan could no longer tolerate it, especially the Japanese military. At that time, they demanded an immediate resolution to the Nakamura case. Military groups such as the Imperial Reservists Association strongly incited Japanese sentiment. As a result, slogans such as "Resolve all pending Sino-Japanese issues" and "Use force if necessary" were loudly proclaimed by the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Narrative of the Manchurian Incident after September 18, 1931</p>
<p>Chapter 4 describes how the increasing tension reached the outbreak on the night of September 18. Regarding the incident on the night of September 18, China and Japan have different and conflicting arguments. The investigation team tried its best to meet with foreign representatives residing in Shenyang at the time of the incident and shortly thereafter, including newspaper reporters. As a result, the following conclusions were obtained. Regarding the conclusions of the Shenyang incident on September 18, "The tension of the military forces of both China and Japan needs no more explanation." (This section describes the report's solemn original text) "According to the various definite words obtained by the investigation team, it can be known that the Japanese side had a meticulously prepared plan to respond to any hostile acts between the country and the Chinese side."</p>
<p>"On the night of September 18, 1931, the plan was implemented with agility and accuracy."</p>
<p>"According to its instructions, the Chinese side did not attack the Japanese army, nor did it have a plan to endanger the lives and property of Japanese residents at a specific time and place. There was no uniform or permitted attack on the Japanese army. The Japanese attack and its subsequent military actions were unexpected by the Chinese side."</p>
<p>"Between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. on September 18, there was indeed an explosion of explosives on or near the railway. However, even if the railway was damaged, it did not prevent the southbound train from Changchun from arriving on time. Moreover, even from the railway damage itself, it is not sufficient to prove the legitimacy of military action."</p>
<p>"The Japanese military action that night cannot be regarded as a legitimate self-defense measure." "However, local officers may believe that their actions were out of self-defense. The investigation team does not reject this assumption when explaining the above sections." The subsequent military actions. This chapter continues to describe the deployment of Japanese troops in Manchuria and their actions on the night of September 18 and thereafter, including the occupation of Changchun from September 18 to 19, the occupation of Jilin on September 21, the bombing of Jinzhou on October 8, and the Nenjiang Bridge battle that started in mid-October and ended on November 9, when the Japanese army occupied Qiqihar, are described in detail. At that time, incidents occurred in Tianjin on November 8 and 26. The statements about the incidents are quite different and unclear. In this report, the impact of the incidents on the situation in the Eastern Provinces is explained, and it is stated that the deposed emperor, who had lived in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin for a long time, secretly went to Lushun, and the occupation of Jinzhou on January 3, 1932, is narrated.</p>
<p>This chapter also continues to trace the military operations of the Japanese army in northern Manchuria, including the occupation of Harbin on February 5 this year, up to the military operations at the end of August this year. It details the mixed battles in various parts of the Eastern Provinces. The battlefields are mostly occupied by Chinese regular troops and informal troops, facing off against the Japanese army and puppet troops. The investigation team believes that it is impossible to describe the exact situation of these battles because the Chinese authorities naturally do not want to reveal accurate information about the troops that are still confronting the Japanese army in the Eastern Provinces, while the Japanese side likes to deliberately devalue the number and combat effectiveness of these troops that are still hostile to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Military situation in early September 1932. The investigation team also expressed that it is impossible to predict whether the general situation in Manchuria can be changed in the near future. At the time of writing the report, the war was still continuing and spreading widely. As for the military operations on the border between Liaoning and Rehe, the report believes that the expansion of the war zone in the area is difficult to reverse and must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Shanghai</p>
<p>This chapter narrates the Shanghai war from February 20 to the final withdrawal of the Japanese army. The League of Nations delegation committee also ended its report here. The investigation team said that the arrival of the delegation in Shanghai on March 14 was an opportunity. In terms of duties, the work of the delegation committee did not need to make special instructions on this local event, but since it had arrived in Shanghai, it was not without benefits to create an air of . The investigation team analyzed the agreement finally signed between China and Japan and expressed its opinion that the Shanghai incident did have a major impact on the situation in Manchuria. The Sino-Japanese war shocked the people, and as a result, the Chinese resistance became more determined. At the same time, in Manchuria, after receiving the news from Shanghai, the morale of the anti-Japanese army scattered in various places was boosted. At the end of this chapter, the artillery incident of the Japanese plane being transferred on February 1, 1932, is narrated. The reports of China and Japan on this case are very different.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: "Manchukuo"</p>
<p>This chapter describes "Manchukuo," divided into three parts. The first part, "The Process of Establishing the New Country," first describes the chaotic situation that occurred after Japan occupied Shenyang, then describes the gradual restoration of order and administration in Shenyang and other provinces, and then describes the establishment of the "New Country," the appointment of the deposed emperor as the interim administrator, the ceremony of taking office in Changchun on March 9, and all the laws under the organization of "Manchukuo." This section ends with the following words:</p>
<p>Since September 18, 1931, the actions of the Japanese military authorities, in both military and civil affairs, have been aimed at political action, and have gradually occupied the three eastern provinces by force, taking them away from under Chinese rule, successively taking away Qiqihar, Jinzhou, Harbin, and finally all the important cities in Manchuria, and after each occupation, the administrative organs there were reorganized. It can be seen from this that before September 1931, Manchuria had never heard of an independence movement. The independence movement was caused by the presence of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>A group of Japanese civil and military officials, both current and retired, planned to organize and implement this movement as a way to solve the Manchurian situation after September 18.</p>
<p>"For this purpose, these personnel used the names and actions of certain Chinese people, and also used the grievances of a small number of residents who were dissatisfied with the previous government."</p>
<p>"It can also be seen from this that the Japanese General Staff initially or soon knew that this independence movement could be used. Therefore, the department provided assistance and command to the organizers of the independence movement."</p>
<p>"Based on all the evidence obtained from all aspects, the investigation team believes that although the formation of "Manchukuo" has some contributing factors, the two most powerful factors are the presence of the Japanese army and the activities of Japanese civil and military officials. In the judgment of the investigation team, without these two, the "new country" could not be established."</p>
<p>"For this reason, the current regime cannot be regarded as arising from a genuine and natural independence movement."</p>
<p>The second part of this chapter describes the organization of the current "Manchukuo" government from the perspective of the Basic Law and administrative position, and also covers finance, education, justice, police, army, and financial conditions, etc., and also describes how the salt administration, customs, and postal administration were taken over. Finally, the investigation team's judgment on this case is included. In this section, the investigation team declared that the "Manchukuo" government's plan listed several enlightened reforms, the implementation of which would not only benefit Manchuria, but would also be suitable for the rest of China. In fact, many of these reforms have already been seen in the Chinese government's plan. However, the investigation team believes that although the period of the "Manchukuo" implementation of this reform plan is short, and has paid considerable attention to its already implemented steps, it is still believed that there is no symbol to prove that the "government" can actually implement many reforms. For example, the future of the budget and currency reform plan that has been promulgated seems to have serious obstacles. Under the unstable and turbulent situation in 1932, a thorough reform plan, stable situation, and economic prosperity will never be realized. As for the nominal leaders of the "government" and its various departments, although they are Chinese living in Manchuria, its important political and administrative powers are still in the hands of Japanese officials and Japanese advisors. The political and administrative organization of the "government" not only gives these officials and advisors the power to contribute technical opinions, but also gives them the opportunity to implement management and command administration. This generation is not subject to the instructions of the Tokyo government, and its policies are not always consistent with the policies of the Japanese government or the Kwantung Army Headquarters. However, in the event of important issues, the officials and advisors who had some ability to act autonomously in the early days of the new organization have gradually been forced to follow the instructions of the Japanese authorities, which relies on its army to occupy the land of Manchuria, and the "Manchukuo government" relies on the army to maintain its internal and external authority. At the same time, the railway under the jurisdiction of "Manchukuo" is entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd. for management, and finally, Japanese consuls are stationed in various important cities to communicate with each other. Therefore, no matter what happens, the Japanese authorities have a way to exercise their great power. The relationship between the "Manchukuo government" and the Japanese authorities has recently become closer due to the dispatch of special envoys. Although the special envoy has not been formally authorized, he has been stationed in the capital of Manchuria in the name of the governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, managing the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd., and also serving as the diplomatic representative, consul, and commander-in-chief of the garrison. The relationship between "Manchukuo" and Japan was difficult to explain in the past, but according to the latest news obtained by the investigation team, the Japanese government intends to confirm this relationship soon. On August 27 this year, the Japanese representative sent a letter to the investigation team, saying that Special Envoy Muto had left Tokyo for Manchuria on August 20. After arriving in Manchuria, he would start negotiations with "Manchukuo" to conclude a basic treaty of friendship between Japan and Manchuria. The Japanese government believes that the conclusion of this treaty is a formal recognition of "Manchukuo."</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>The third part of this chapter discusses the attitude of the residents of Manchuria towards the "new country." The investigation team first explained that it was very difficult to collect this evidence under the situation at the time. The special protection imposed on the investigation team due to the prevention of real or imagined dangers was enough to make general witnesses run away. Many Chinese people even dared not meet with the members of the investigation team. Therefore, it was not easy to talk with all walks of life, and secret appointments were necessary. However, the investigation team still overcame all difficulties. In addition to public talks with various officials, it was still able to achieve the purpose of talking with private individuals such as merchants, bankers, teachers, doctors, police officers, and workers.</p>
<p>The investigation team also received more than 1,500 letters, some of which were handed in person, but most of them were delivered through the post office. The information obtained in this way was re-verified with neutral parties to the extent possible. The investigation team then interpreted the psychological state of the various groups of people it contacted, and finally came to the conclusion that individual groups occasionally supported "Manchukuo," but "the general Chinese people all take a different approach. The so-called "Manchukuo government" is simply a tool of the Japanese in the eyes of the local Chinese people."</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Japanese Economic Interests and Chinese Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>This chapter recognizes that the struggle between China and Japan is not only of a military nature but also of an economic nature. China uses boycotts of goods, ships, and banks as weapons to resist Japan, with the aim of completely severing economic and financial ties with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>After pointing out that Japan's main method of solving Japan's population problem is to develop industry and export manufactured goods, and after investigating Japan's economic and financial interests in China, the investigation team proceeded to study the economic sanctions movement. The investigation team believes that the economic sanctions used by the Chinese people originated from the habits of the century. The training and psychological attitudes thus obtained are mixed with the modern nationalism represented by the Kuomintang, and thus constitute today's economic sanctions movement. Its impact on Sino-Japanese relations is very significant from both material and psychological aspects.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The investigation team has come to the conclusion that the Chinese economic sanctions are widespread and organized, originating from strong national emotions, which are then inspired by strong national emotions. However, these economic sanctions are dominated and directed by the state. The group can issue and collect them, and has coercive methods to implement them. In terms of organization, although it includes the majority of individual groups, the important controlling agency is the Kuomintang. As for the methods of economic sanctions, the investigation team declared that illegal actions are often inevitable, but here, the actions directly against Japanese residents should be distinguished from the actions against Chinese people who violate the economic sanctions regulations in order to harm the interests of the Japanese people. The former is less common than the economic sanctions in the past, while the latter occurs frequently. The investigation team is of the opinion that the Chinese government should be held responsible for not fully preventing these actions and for providing some direct assistance to the economic sanctions movement. The investigation team did not suggest that it is improper for government agencies to assist the economic sanctions movement, but only wishes to express that official encouragement contains government responsibility.</p>
<p>The Chinese government claims that economic sanctions are a legitimate weapon to resist the military aggression of powerful countries, especially in cases where arbitration methods have not been used in advance. In the opinion of the investigation team, this statement raises a broader issue. Under the condition that Chinese people do not go beyond the scope of their family laws, no one can deny their right to refuse to buy Japanese goods or to express this opinion in personal or group actions. However, whether implementing an organized boycott of trade with a single country is in line with good neighborliness or conflicts with treaty obligations is a matter of international law and not within the scope of the investigation team's investigation. For the sake of the interests of all countries in the world, the investigation team hopes that this issue should be discussed as soon as possible and regulated by international agreements.</p>
<p>The conclusion of this chapter states that in terms of the mutual dependence of Sino-Japanese trade and the interests of both sides, economic closeness is necessary. However, as long as the political relations between the two countries are not satisfactory, so that one side adopts military force and the other side adopts economic sanctions to contain each other, there will be no possibility of closeness.</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Economic Interests in Manchuria</p>
<p>This chapter briefly discusses the economic interests in Manchuria, focusing on a detailed study of the economic interests of China and Japan. A special memorandum is attached to the report, which involves various issues such as investment, the economic relationship between Japan and Manchuria, the economic relationship between China and the region, Japan's opportunities to immigrate to Manchuria, the impact of Chinese immigration on Manchuria, railways and currency issues, etc. In this chapter, the investigation team expressed its deep belief that the economic interests of China and Japan in Manchuria, in themselves, should enter the path of mutual understanding and cooperation, not conflict, if separated from recent political events. To seek the full development of Manchuria's current resources and future economic capabilities, it is necessary for both sides to reconcile.</p>
<p>The investigation team also declared that the principle of the open door must be maintained in terms of both legal and practical viewpoints. The maintenance of this principle is the blessing of Japan, Manchuria, and other parts of China.</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Principles and Conditions of Resolution</p>
<p>From the review of the previous chapters, it is clear that the Sino-Japanese issue itself could be resolved through arbitration. However, because the governments of each country handled this issue, especially the Manchurian issue, the relationship between the two countries deteriorated, resulting in conflicts that could not be avoided sooner or later. It has been stated in the previous chapters of this report that China is a country that is progressing through political disputes, social disorders, and divisive trends that are inevitable in the transitional era. It has also been roughly described how Japan's claimed rights and interests are greatly affected by the weakness of the Chinese central government, and how Japan is eager to separate Manchuria from the Chinese government has also been clarified. A brief study of the policies of the Chinese, Russian, and Japanese governments in Manchuria reveals that the local government of the Three Eastern Provinces had declared independence from the Chinese central government more than once, but its people were all Chinese, and they had never intended to break away from China. Finally, we have carefully examined the true events since September 18, 1931, and have expressed our opinions on this.</p>
<p>The Complexity of the Issue</p>
<p>Now we can end our past feelings and focus our attention on the future. Those who have read the previous chapters must understand that the issues in the current conflict are not as simple as usually proposed. In fact, this issue is extraordinarily complex, and only those who are deeply familiar with all the facts and their historical background are sufficient to express a correct opinion, because this case is neither a case of one country declaring war on another without first using the opportunity for peaceful handling stipulated in the covenant of the International League of Nations, nor is it a simple case of one neighboring country invading the borders of another neighboring country with force. It is because Manchuria has many characteristics that cannot be accurately compared to other parts of the world." This dispute occurred between two member states of the International League of Nations, involving a territory equal to that of France and Germany. Both sides believe that they have rights and interests in it, and only a few of their rights and interests are clearly stipulated by international law. Although the territory is legally an inseparable part of China, its local government has sufficient autonomy to directly negotiate events with Japan, and such events are the root cause of this conflict.</p>
<p>The situation in Manchuria is incomparable to other places</p>
<p>Japan controls a railway and a section of land leading directly from the seaport to the center of Manchuria, with about 10,000 soldiers protecting the area. Japan also claims the right to increase its troops to 15,000 if necessary in accordance with the treaty. It also exercises its national jurisdiction over Japanese residents in Manchuria. Consular police are set up throughout the three eastern provinces.</p>
<p>Different interpretations</p>
<p>The above sections must be considered by those who debate this issue. The fact is that without a declaration of war, a large part of the land, which is undoubtedly Chinese territory, has been forcibly seized and occupied by Japanese forces, and this behavior has separated it from China and declared it independent. Japan said that the steps taken in this case were in line with the obligations of the International League of Nations covenant, the non-war pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, but in fact, the meaning of each of these treaties is to prevent this behavior, and this behavior began at the beginning of submitting the report to the International League of Nations and was completed in the months thereafter. The Japanese government believes that this behavior is consistent with the guarantees made by its representatives in Geneva on September 30 and December 10. Those who defend this behavior say that all military actions are legitimate self-defense movements. The right of self-defense is included in each of the above-mentioned international treaties, and the Council of the International League of Nations has not made any resolutions to cancel it. As for the new organization that replaced China's administrative organization in the Three Eastern Provinces, it is said to be the action of the local people, voluntarily independent and separated from China to form a government. This genuine independence movement is not prohibited by any international treaty or any resolution in the Council of the International League of Nations.</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Monday (7)</p>
<p>What is forbidden, and the occurrence of this fact has greatly changed the application of the Nine-Power Treaty and completely changed the nature of the incident being investigated by the League of Nations. This defense argument has made the conflict more complex and serious. The task of this investigation team is not to debate this case, but to find ways to provide sufficient materials so that the League of Nations can obtain a solution that is suitable for the honor, dignity, and national interests of the countries in dispute. Mere praise and criticism are not enough to achieve this goal. It is necessary to engage in practical efforts to mediate. We have striven to find out the truth of the Manchurian incident in the past and explain it frankly, and acknowledge that this is only part of the work, and not the most important part. During the investigation, we repeatedly informed both governments that we would like to use the power of the League of Nations to help the two countries mediate the dispute, and decided to recommend to the League of Nations to maintain the permanent interests of China and Japan in Manchuria in a way that is suitable for fairness and peace. Solutions that cannot be considered satisfactory include</p>
<p>(1) Restoring the Status Quo</p>
<p>From the above sections, it can be understood that simply restoring the status quo is not a solution, because this conflict occurred under the various circumstances that existed before September of last year. Therefore, if the various circumstances are restored to their original state today, it will only make the dispute reappear. This is only thinking about the theoretical aspects of the case as a whole, and not taking into account the true situation of the situation.</p>
<p>(2) Maintaining "Manchukuo"</p>
<p>From the previous two chapters, maintaining and recognizing the current political system in Manchuria is also equally inappropriate, because we believe that this solution is not in line with the main principles of international obligations, and is detrimental to the friendship between the two countries, which is related to peace in the Far East, and violates China's interests and disregards the wishes of the people of Manchuria. In addition, it is still doubtful whether this method can maintain Japan's permanent interests in the future. There is no doubt about the feelings of the people of Manchuria towards the current political system. China is also determined not to accept the method of completely separating the three eastern provinces from the country as a final solution. Even comparing the distant frontier Outer Mongolia with Manchuria is not appropriate, because Outer Mongolia does not have close economic and social relations with China, and the population is sparse, and most of them are not Han Chinese. The situation in Manchuria is very different from Outer Mongolia. The millions of Han Chinese who are now cultivating in that area have made Manchuria a natural extension of Inner China, and in terms of race, culture, and national character, the degree of Sinicization in the three eastern provinces is no different from its neighboring provinces of Hebei and Shandong, because most of its immigrants come from these two provinces.</p>
<p>Moreover, past experiences have proven that the authorities in Manchuria have had a significant impact on the affairs of other parts of China (at least North China), and have occupied undoubted military and political conveniences. Whether legally or in fact, separating the province from other parts of China will create a serious and incomprehensible problem in the future, making China always hostile, and perhaps triggering a continued boycott of Japanese goods. This investigation team has received a clear and valuable statement from the Japanese government regarding the country's major interests in Manchuria. The economic dependence of Japan on Manchuria has been discussed in the previous chapter. This investigation team does not need to elaborate on it further. This investigation team also does not advocate that Japan should enjoy economic and even political management rights due to economic relations, but we still acknowledge the importance of Manchuria in Japan's economic development. Japan requires the construction of a solid government that can maintain order for the country's economic development. We also do not think it is unreasonable. However, this situation can only be effectively guaranteed by a management agency that conforms to local public opinion and fully complies with their feelings and aspirations. We further believe that only in an atmosphere of external faith, internal peace, and complete difference from the current situation in the Far East, the investment necessary for the rapid economic development of Manchuria can flow in. Although there is the suffering of overpopulation and increase, Japan does not seem to have made full use of its existing facilities to engage in immigration. The Japanese government has no large-scale immigration plan to Manchuria so far, but Japan does want to use further industrial plans to seek a solution to the agricultural crisis and population problem. Industrial plans require expanding , and Japan can only in Asia, especially in China, find this kind of expanded and more reliable market. Japan needs not only the Manchurian market, but also the entire Chinese market. The consolidation of China modernization can raise the standard of living, thus stimulating trade and increasing the purchasing power of the Chinese market.</p>
<p>This economic proximity between China and Japan is of great interest to Japan, and also of equal interest to China. China can obtain assistance in the main tasks of national construction by cooperating with Japan in economic and technical terms. If China can restrain the embarrassing trend of its nationalism, and after friendly relations are restored, earnestly guarantee that organized boycotts of goods will not occur again, it will be of great benefit to this economic proximity. On the Japanese side, if it does</p>
<h3>The Value of the League of Nations Investigating Committee's Report, Part 1</h3>
<p>What comfort can the findings of the League of Nations Investigating Committee, which investigated in June, bring to the Chinese people, who are enduring humiliation and harboring resentment? Or will it further inflame their emotions? This question has a clear answer for us with the formal publication of the investigation report.</p>
<p>If the Chinese people believe that the statements in this report create a crisis where China is placed at a disadvantage, then they should understand that when the investigating committee was dispatched, it was not to monitor Japan's fulfillment of its promise to withdraw troops. Instead, it was to study any situation that could affect international relations and disrupt the understanding that maintains peace between China and Japan. China was already facing a predetermined crisis of failure in this investigation. Recalling the domestic public opinion when the League of Nations resolution was announced last December, it was clearly divided into two factions. Group A actively opposed it, advocating for resolute rejection. Group B wanted to use it as a means to expose Japan's actions to the world, advocating for courteous reception and using it as a propaganda channel. Later, Sir Lytton and the five commissioners came east with the arduous mission of the League of Nations. Although the Shanghai war had stopped, Japan's power was still strong. The Chinese government and people followed the proposal of Group B mentioned above, treating them with courtesy and respect, hoping to fully utilize the opportunity for propaganda. However, on March 28, Sir Lytton clearly stated at a reception hosted by the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, that "The League of Nations can never help one member state to the detriment of another." This was essentially foreshadowing today's outcome to us. Therefore, if we had not had excessive expectations of the investigating committee, we would not need to be excessively disappointed today. When the League of Nations resolution was underway last December, some advised the Chinese representatives that what the League of Nations was preparing was the best solution that could be proposed under the current circumstances. Now, Sir Lytton and others have presented what they believe to be the best solution that can be proposed.</p>

Chapter Four narrates the September 18th Incident and Japan's military actions in the three eastern provinces after September 18th, and the conclusions reached by the investigating committee after examining the September 18th Incident. Chapter Five describes the Shanghai Incident. Chapter Six describes the "Manchukuo," divided into three parts: (1) the process of creating the "new state," (2) the current government of "Manchukuo," and (3) the attitude of the residents of the three eastern provinces towards the "new state." Chapter Seven addresses the League of Nations. Sir Lytton and others used the phrase "if the dispute is definitely accepted in this type of principled solution, there is room for amendment" in Chapter Ten of the report. Its reverse clearly shows that there is room for disputes and unwillingness to accept. And the true value of the report, in other words, the extent to which its recommendations can be realized, can be seen here.</p>
<p>The first mission of the investigation report is to examine the dispute between China and Japan. After carefully reading the full text of the report, we see in the first eight chapters its examination of the Sino-Japanese dispute. For example, Chapter Four, which describes the September 18th Incident, states that "The military action taken by the Japanese on that night cannot be regarded as a legitimate measure of self-defense." Chapter Six, which describes the establishment of the puppet organization, states that "A number of Japanese civilian and military officials, both current and retired, are scheming to organize and implement this movement as a solution to the situation in Manchuria after September 18th." It is determined that "the current regime cannot be regarded as having been produced by a genuine and natural independent movement." It states that "As far as the Manchurian government is concerned, it is truly a tool of the Japanese in the eyes of the local Chinese." This kind of fair examination makes us have to admire the investigating committee's sharp vision and appropriate attitude. If it could not be constrained by the wording in the resolution when it was dispatched, and based on international justice and international law, determined an accurate solution, then its solution would be more beneficial to reality than the current recommendations. This can be asserted. However, because it inevitably sought materials in aspects such as "disrupting the understanding that maintains peace between China and Japan," it retrospectively recounted old Sino-Japanese disputes in Chapter Three, and Chapter Seven described Japan's economic interests and the Chinese people's economic boycott, which in turn obscured the true and clear understanding with these complex chapters. As a result, the world's understanding of the investigating committee's examination is insufficient. This is something we cannot help but regret when assessing the value of the report.</p>
<p>The last two chapters of the report describe the principles and conditions for resolving the dispute and make recommendations to the League of Nations Council. The questions are mixed and cannot be fully accommodated in this short article. We will continue the discussion tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven describes Japan's economic interests in China and the Chinese anti-Japanese boycott movement. Chapter Eight describes the economic interests of Manchuria, paying particular attention to Japan's interests in Manchuria. Chapter Nine describes the principles and conditions for resolution. Chapter Ten describes the opinions and recommendations of the investigating committee to the League of Nations Council.</p>
<p>What is released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today is the translated introduction and main text. However, Chapters Nine and Ten of the main text are the complete crystallization of the report and are of great importance. Therefore, the entire text is translated and published. Editor's note: The report of the Sino-Japanese Dispute Investigating Committee was signed in Peiping on September 4, 1932. Apart from the introduction, it is divided into ten chapters. Special studies on various issues are included in the appendix of the report. In addition, there is an appendix that lists the itinerary taken by the committee, the names of the people it met, and the documents submitted to the committee by both China and Japan. This appendix and the attachments on special studies will be announced later.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The introduction first describes the situation when China submitted the Sino-Japanese dispute to the League of Nations Council due to the Pan Yang Incident on September 18, 1931 (China's request was submitted on September 21, 1931, in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant), the actions taken by the League of Nations, and the appointment of the investigating committee in accordance with the resolution of February 10, 1931. The investigating committee consisted of the following members:</p>
<p>Earl Lytton (British),</p>
<p>General Claudel (French),</p>
<p>Major General McCoy (American),</p>
<p>Dr. Schnee (German).</p>
<p>On February 3, 1932, before the investigating committee set off for the Far East via the United States, it held two meetings in Geneva and unanimously elected Sir Lytton as the chairman of the investigating committee. Subsequently, the Japanese government and the Chinese government designated participating representatives as follows:</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, Ting Weijun,</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to Turkey, Yoshida,</p>
<p>Chief of Section of the League of Nations Secretariat, Haas, who was later appointed as Secretary-General of the investigating committee. During the investigation, various experts served as its consultants. A few days before the investigating committee departed, the Chinese government made further requests on January 29 in accordance with Articles 10, 11, and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, and on February 12, 1932, requested the Council to submit the dispute between China and Japan to the League of Nations General Assembly for discussion in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 9 of the League of Nations Covenant. Since then, the investigating committee has not received any instructions from the Council, so it still interprets its own mission in accordance with the Council's resolution of December 10 as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To examine the dispute between China and Japan (including the causes and development of this dispute, and those that are in crisis during the investigation) and (2) to consider possible solutions to the Sino-Japanese dispute (it is necessary to reconcile the fundamental interests of the two countries). The concept of the investigating committee's own mission, the outline of the investigating committee's work and itinerary, and the plan for the report are all determined by the concept of the investigating committee's own mission. The concept is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The rights and interests of China and Japan in Manchuria are the fundamental cause of this dispute. The committee has described these rights and interests as the historical background of this dispute.</p>
<p>(2) Examine the specific disputes that occurred most recently before the dispute occurred, and describe the development of events after September 18, 1931. In the process of studying this dispute, the committee stated that it places less emphasis on the responsibility for past actions and more emphasis on seeking ways to prevent such actions from happening again in the future. (3) Finally, the committee considers the various points of contention and puts forward several recommendations based on the principles that the committee believes are sufficient to permanently resolve this conflict and restore goodwill between China and Japan, and the report ends.</p>
<p>Itinerary Before reaching Manchuria, the committee had contact with the governments of China and Japan and people representing various opinions to determine the nature of each party's interests. The committee arrived in Tokyo on February 29, stayed in Shanghai from March 14 to 26, stayed in Nanjing from March 16 to April 1, and continued in China before arriving in Peiping on April 9. Then it went to Manchuria, where it stayed until June 4, for a period of six weeks. In the middle, it visited various important cities in the area. Finally, the investigating committee went to Peiping and Tokyo again in June and July, and then stayed in Peiping on July 20, where it engaged in drafting the report.</p>
<p>Background to the Current Dispute Chapters One, Two, and Three explain that the occurrence of the September 18th Shenyang Incident was the result of a long period of minor conflicts, which was enough to show that Sino-Japanese relations were becoming increasingly tense. If we want to thoroughly understand the truth of the recent dispute between the two countries, we must be willing to understand the recent relationship between the two countries. For example, the development of Chinese national spirit, the expansion policies of the Japanese Empire and the old Russian Empire, the recent broadcast of Soviet communism, and the economic and national defense strategies of China, Japan, and the Soviet Union are all considered important facts in the study of the Manchurian problem. It is also necessary to describe the main negotiations between China and Japan in Manchuria before September 18, because only in this way can we determine why Manchuria became the focus of the dispute, and how the fundamental interests of both parties can be truly reconciled in the future when the dispute subsides, and what kind of problems are worth studying in order to permanently resolve this dispute.</p>
<h3>After the Investigation Committee Report Was Released</h3>
<p>The Central Government Temporarily Does Not Express Opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The summary of the investigation committee report contains more than 20,000 words. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent section chief Lu Qiyun with thirty mimeographed copies on a 12:50 airline flight to Shanghai. It was released at 8:00 p.m. at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although the investigation committee report has been released, the government is now beginning to study its contents, so it will not express its opinions temporarily. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Central News Agency reporter met with a senior government official on the evening of the 2nd and asked what he thought after reviewing the summary of the report. According to him, the report does not lack criticism of our country's politics, and we should vigorously examine ourselves. At the same time, the report also has praise for us, and we should not be complacent because of this. We should focus on the big picture when it comes to the solutions suggested in the report and strive for the benefit of the country and the nation. As for the fundamental solution to the problem of the eastern provinces, we should look to the future and strive to revitalize ourselves. In short, we do not need to be disappointed and disheartened by the release of the report, nor do we need to increase our dependence on the League of Nations because of it. Self-reliance and self-determination are the only ways to achieve a satisfactory solution to the problem of the eastern provinces. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch) (Peiping) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Lu Xiaozhou and others to Peiping with fifty copies of the investigation committee report on a military aircraft.

<h3>The Puppet Police of Yuguan Open Fire to Provoke</h3>
<p>Intruding into Our Army's Defense Line in Two Places, Killing Three Sentries</p>
<p>He Zhuguo Orders the Closure of the Four Gates to Prevent Puppet Police from Sneaking In</p>
<p>After Negotiations with the Japanese Garrison, the Puppet Police Have Already Withdrawn</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) At around 8:00 p.m. on the 1st, a team of more than twenty puppet police suddenly arrived at Dongluocheng outside the East Gate of Yuguan. They were fully armed and fired more than twenty rifle shots before rushing into the city gate and climbing the city tower to observe. The military police stationed in the city maintained their composure and secretly took precautions to prevent a large-scale attack. At this moment, two more puppet police were discovered outside the East Gate, rushing into the guard line outside the East Gate and climbing the "First Pass Under Heaven." They fired several shots at the troops of our army's regimental headquarters east of the city, killing one soldier and wounding two sentries on the pass. The remaining soldiers also returned fire in self-defense, killing one puppet policeman. After Commander He Zhuguo received the continued report from Regimental Commander Shi, he adopted a calm attitude, not wanting this matter to affect local security, so he closed the four gates to prevent the puppet police from sneaking in. At the same time, he immediately sent Ning Xiangnan and Chen Mingrui of the Foreign Affairs Section to the Yuji Japanese Garrison to meet Captain Ochiai and explain the aforementioned facts, and solemnly negotiate. Ochiai replied that he would use effective methods to stop it as a third party. Finally, the gunshots stopped, but the puppet police still lingered in Dongluocheng and did not leave all night. On the morning of the 2nd, He Zhuguo further negotiated with Ochiai and expressed his regret for the unfortunate incident. As a result, Ochiai agreed to be responsible for mediation, and both parties agreed to conduct an on-site investigation first. Although there was some tension here, it is believed that it will not escalate. At 11:00 a.m. today, an aircraft from the east flew around Yuguan for a week. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) At noon on the 2nd, He Zhuguo, He Jinghua, and Captain Ochiai inspected the scene of the incident that occurred in Dongluocheng, the First Pass, one night after one day. Under the on-site supervision of He and Ochiai, the puppet police in Dongluocheng were completely withdrawn. The corpses of the puppet police on the First Pass and the dead soldiers under our city were each taken away by both parties. The armored train that arrived at the pass from Suizhong on the morning of the 2nd also returned to Suizhong at 4:00 p.m. A sudden disturbance was quelled. The local situation has now returned to its original state. The Japanese army maintained a calm attitude after the incident occurred one day and one night. He Zhuguo has already reported the details to the Peiping Military Sub-Council. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Tianjin: The headquarters of the Chinese Garrison Army announced today as follows: At about 5:00 p.m. last night (the 1st), soldiers of the Chinese Ninth Brigade caused a small dispute by demanding that the Manchurian police supervisors outside the East Gate of Shanhaiguan withdraw, and the two sides formed a confrontational situation. At night, the Chinese sentry opened fire, and the Manchurian police team entered and exited the "First Pass Under Heaven" and its vicinity. Japanese Shanhaiguan Garrison Commander Major Ochiai, at the request of the Chinese side, dispatched a unit to the area for the purpose of mediation, investigation of the facts, and prevention of conflict, and is continuing to mediate. In addition, although the Japanese residents in the area were shaken when the incident occurred, they returned to calm after learning the truth. (2nd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>Legislative Yuan Organized</p>
<h3>Committee to Revise the Criminal Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to make China's current criminal law and criminal procedure law suitable for actual needs, the Legislative Yuan has specially designated members Liu Kejun and four others to organize a drafting committee for revising the criminal law and criminal procedure law. Xi Chaojun talked about how the committee plans to complete its work before the end of its term (November). More than half of the general principles of the current criminal law have been revised, totaling more than 70 articles, which are slightly different from the old law, that is, a chapter on education and security measures has been added. According to the old law, criminals under the age of 13 and those suffering from mental illness are not subject to criminal penalties, but they are still a danger to society. Therefore, a special chapter has been added to educate and transform these criminals. As for the specific provisions, it is planned to reduce the special laws as much as possible so that the law can be fully practical. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The Han army suffered three deaths and thirty-four injuries. The reserve team stationed in Shahe, behind the Yunxi camp, advanced towards Zhaoyuan to strike Liu's flank. On the morning of the 2nd, a Han army plane flew from Weixian to Qingdao. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) A Red Cross rescue team departed for the Pingdu area on the morning of the 2nd to provide medical assistance. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Urgent telegram from Shahe: At dawn today, Liu's army set up artillery at the Huoshen Temple in the South Gate of Yexian and initiated hostilities by bombarding the provincial army's front lines.</p>
<p>This led to a conflict with heavy artillery bombardment, which was extremely fierce, with thick smoke and obscured scenery, unprecedented since the incident began. The extent of the damage is unknown. Cao Fulin, the commander of the provincial army, inspected the front lines at 6 a.m. and returned to Shahe at 9 a.m. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) It is confirmed that Liu's army in Qixia has withdrawn, with only two or three hundred members of the militia and public security bureau guarding the city. The provincial army can occupy it upon arrival. Xie Shuxian's militia arrived in Zhaoyuan on the 26th, Huangxian on the 27th, and Penglai on the 28th. They have now arrived in Fushan for defense. Fearing rumors, Han suspended his inspection to the east. Headquarters received intelligence that after Liu's army arrived in Laiyang, they ordered teachers and students of all schools to move out within 24 hours and stationed troops, forcibly demanding thousands of cotton quilts from merchants and residents in Laiyang city. When the supply was not promptly met, Liu's army resorted to looting. According to refugees who escaped, the losses in Laiyang will reach nearly one million. Liu's army imposed a levy of fifty catties of hemp per household on merchants in Laiyang city, with those who failed to comply subject to military law. Liu transferred two battalions of guards from Muping to Laiyang to strengthen defenses. Liu's army plotted to attack the provincial army during military affairs and work. It is reported that Liu has secretly planted landmines on important roads in Laiyang and Yexian. Pingdu is peaceful, and the adjacent areas are also calm, etc. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The people of various counties in Jiaodong, hearing rumors that Liu's troops were reducing their defense area and not being transferred out of Shandong, sent telegrams in opposition. It is reported that Han stated that as long as the people can get by, he personally has no prejudices. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng returned to Beiping this afternoon. According to his discussion of the Jiaodong issue, it can be resolved soon. Liu Zhennian still leads his troops stationed in Yexian city, with most of them in the Laiyang and Qixia areas, without major losses. The Han army is outside Yexian city, awaiting orders. The mediation method has not yet been decided. I will still return to Jinan within two or three days. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang emphasizes resolving the Shandong issue without damaging the central government's prestige. Zhu Peide told people, hoping that Han and Liu would prioritize the national crisis, realize their errors, immediately respect the central government's authority, and no longer resort to arms, so that post-incident arrangements can be discussed. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin telegraphed Han and Liu again, urging them to effectively cease military operations, and telegraphed Jiang to request instructions on the final disposition. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The staff office of the 21st Division telegraphed the division's liaison office in Beijing on the 1st, stating that although the Han army announced a cessation of attacks, they are actually actively reinforcing the front lines. Recently, a regiment of Han troops arrived at Guanli Town, under the jurisdiction of Qixia County, and more than 2,000 troops arrived at Malian Town, under the jurisdiction of Zhaoyuan County. Two regiments arrived in Zhaoyuan city, and more than 2,000 troops arrived in Huangxian. Many people in various areas are fleeing to Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. They hope to report to the central government immediately and request instructions on what to do. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian of Laiyang issued a circular telegram, stating: To all newspaper offices: Unfortunately, the Party and the nation are in trouble, and the Japanese pirates are showing their ferocity. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor should unite to resist foreign aggression. How can we engage in fratricide and embolden the imperialists? Yet Han Fuqu is pursuing his own selfish interests, taking advantage of the national crisis to launch a surprise attack on our troops. Zhennian is not talented but still knows to love the country. How can I bear to see China fall and the people suffer? I have already complied with the telegram orders of the President of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Wang, the Minister of Military Affairs, He, and the Beiping Political Committee, to cease military operations and gather troops at the garrisons of Yantai, Muping, Qixia, Yexian, etc., to await the central government's handling. Who would have thought that Han Fuqu would disregard the central government's orders, treating them as worthless, and continue to attack the areas of Zhaoyuan, Qixia, and Huangxian on Yangjing and other days? He also ordered soldiers to disguise themselves in plain clothes and cause disturbances everywhere, falsely claiming it was a popular uprising to confuse the public. All sorts of demonic tricks are being used to the extreme. Such expansion of military operations is truly disregard for the central government, fueling the flames of the enemy, and pursuing his own selfish interests. He is truly a traitor to the Party and the nation, and a public enemy of the people. If we do not launch a major attack to eliminate this [], justice will surely be lost, and the national law will be trampled upon. I hope that all comrades in arms and all [], will jointly uphold righteousness, unanimously condemn him, so as to rectify discipline and bring peace to the Party and the nation. I am eagerly looking forward to it. Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 31st Division of the Chen Army, and Deputy Commander He Yisan, kowtow.</p>

<p>(Hankou) On the 2nd, Jiang telegraphed Sichuan generals Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, and Tian Songyao, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, etc., earnestly speaking of China should no longer have civil war. He ordered them to instruct their subordinates to dispel misunderstandings, each garrison their original defenses, and not to leave without authorization. If there are unavoidable difficulties, they should also report to the central government and wait for disposal, and not resort to direct action.

<h3>Kidnapping of British Nationals in Niuzhuang</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese military authorities are confident that Mrs. Bowley and Mr. Corker, who have been kidnapped for more than three weeks, can be rescued within two or three days. The Japanese are using the method of "using bandits to catch bandits," allowing surrendered bandits to negotiate directly with the kidnappers. The Japanese believe that it is not necessary to pay a ransom to rescue the kidnapped British nationals. Even if a ransom is required, it will only be a small portion of the amount demanded. In any case, the Japanese are determined not to accept the various demands made by the bandits. Lieutenant General Muto, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, is paying close attention to this matter. The bandits are constantly changing their residences to avoid a forceful rescue, so it is quite difficult to have direct contact with the bandits. Mrs. Bowley and others have been kidnapped for 24 days, and they are tied up every night to prevent them from escaping. However, it is reported that they are still healthy, but they are very frustrated that the rescue has not been successful. If negotiations fail, the Japanese army will consult with the military authorities of "Manchukuo" and devise other methods to ensure the safe return of the two British nationals. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Since the bandit leader reduced the Bowley and Corker ransom from 1.2 million yuan to 1.1 million yuan, there has been no further news from the bandits' lair. They are waiting for the messenger to arrive this morning to determine the next steps. The bandits have threatened the local farmers, saying that if they cut the sorghum, they will be punished. However, today in some areas, the sorghum cutting has started under the protection of the army. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st: According to various indications here today, the United States will fully cooperate with the League of Nations when considering the Manchurian issues mentioned in the Lytton Report next week. At present, this place is holding the release of the report with the greatest interest, hoping that this report and its recommendations can be an important milestone in the relationship between Eastern and Western countries. According to officials, the United States may not have any surprising or completely new proposals at this time, because the US position has been clearly understood through Secretary of State Stimson's repeated declarations and Senator Reed's recent visit to Europe to meet with politicians from various countries.</p>

<h3>Premature Release of the Lytton Report by Japan</h3>
<p>The Foreign Ministry Rushes to Draft an Opinion Paper, Aiming to Complete it Within Four Weeks</p>
<p>Few Disputes on the First Five Chapters, Significant Objections to the Sixth Chapter</p>
<p>The Military Strongly Opposes the Exceeding of Self-Defense Rights</p>
<p>Tsuushin, Tokyo, 2nd - The translation of the Lytton Report was finalized last night, and the printing of both the English and translated versions was completed this morning. The Foreign Ministry released the report at 9:00 AM today. The original English text consists of 389 pages, while the translated version has 800 pages. For convenience, a summary of the main points, comprising 50 to 60 pages, was released simultaneously with the report.</p>
<p>Tsuushin, Tokyo, 2nd - Following the release of the report, the Foreign Ministry immediately began drafting the Japanese government's response. Key figures from the Foreign Ministry and the military will hold important discussions, and a committee will be established to draft the opinion paper. It is anticipated that this will be completed within four weeks, after which it will be sent to Geneva. Concurrently, the committee will review Japan's strategies for the League of Nations Council and General Assembly.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - The initial reaction of the Foreign Ministry to the Lytton Report can be summarized as follows: there are very few points of contention regarding Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. However, Chapter 6 is strongly opposed, as it diminishes the overall value of the report and appears to have been written with extreme bias. Generally speaking, the main criticism of the report is that the section on Manchuria is disproportionately large, while the sections on China and the Far East are too brief. Furthermore, it is believed that if the investigation team had properly understood the scope of its responsibilities under the League of Nations resolutions, Chapters 9 and 10 would not have been included. However, it is acknowledged that these two chapters contain some positive resolutions. Other major points of criticism include the assertion in Chapter 8 that Japan's assertion of a special position in Manchuria is inconsistent with the Nine-Power Treaty, and the claim in Chapter 4 that the bombing of the railway bridge near Shenyang on the night of September 18th of the previous year was insufficient justification for military action, and that the subsequent actions exceeded the scope of self-defense. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the government believes that those on the scene at the time are best suited to judge what actions must be taken, and therefore the investigation team's conclusions are unacceptable. However, the government is comforted by the fact that Lord Lytton and his colleagues had no intention of insulting the Japanese army as aggressors. Regarding Chapter 6, it seems that the investigation team placed too much emphasis on the evidence of very ordinary, unknown Chinese individuals, while the evidence presented by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" authorities was not given credence. The investigation team only spent two weeks in Manchuria, which was insufficient to investigate everything, especially at a time when the newly established "Manchukuo" was still in a state of disorder. Moreover, the investigation team spent a long time in Peiping, under the influence of Zhang Xueliang, and it is undoubtedly the case that they were swayed by him, intentionally or unintentionally. The spokesperson then commented on the final chapters, saying that they contain some good resolutions, but Japan cannot allow a third party to interfere in the resolution of the Manchurian dispute, nor does it agree to the proposal for autonomy, as "Manchukuo" has already been recognized by Japan. Japan believes that the investigation team's opinions do not pave the way for Sino-Japanese negotiations on the Manchurian issue, but that the investigation team's recommendations regarding Manchuria could be applied to the relationship between China and the major powers and be beneficial, such as the development of an international co-management plan. The spokesperson then expressed admiration for the hard work of the investigation team, but concluded, "The report contains many unfair points towards Japan, but absolutely no unfair points towards China." Finally, the spokesperson stated that the Japanese government will strongly refute the claim that the Manchurian independence movement was encouraged and supported by the Japanese Army General Staff, and said that Japan will issue a statement refuting and correcting the facts and erroneous ideas recorded in the first eight chapters.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - Japanese army authorities are now accepting the Lytton Report with a calm demeanor, which is quite unexpected. An army ministry spokesperson told reporters tonight that he praised the work of the investigation team and said that after reviewing the summary of the report, the army ministry felt that there was no need to change its previously announced opinions to the world and was deeply confident that the League of Nations and the major powers would gradually understand the justice of Japan's claims.</p>
<p>Tsuushin, Tokyo, 2nd - Regarding the Lytton Investigation Team's report, the opinions were collected separately by the General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army until noon today, and a joint meeting of the departments was held from 1:00 PM to decide on the final countermeasures. After the report was released, the army's opinions were immediately released. It is said that the army attaches more importance to the description of Japanese military actions than to the conclusions of the report. According to reliable sources, the report objectively criticizes Japan's military actions, saying that although Japanese soldiers acted with the understanding that they were not exceeding the scope of self-defense, Japan's military actions did indeed exceed the scope of self-defense. This, of course, violates Article 10 of the League Covenant and the Non-War Treaty, so the army absolutely opposes this view and its attitude is very strong. What final decision the joint meeting of the Ministry of the Army and the General Staff Headquarters will reach this afternoon is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 2nd - After the Foreign Ministry translated the Lytton Report, it distributed the translation to the Ministries of the Army and Navy, and the three ministries began to review the content together and prepared to produce an opinion paper. At the same time, a special committee was established to handle direct affairs. Given the importance of the opinion paper to the League of Nations, it will not only be discussed by the three ministry committees, but will also be produced in cooperation with reference to the opinions of political parties and financial circles. After reading the report, the parties concerned roughly held the following opinions, so the opinion paper will also be based on the following opinions: (1) The content of the Lytton Report is six parts favorable to Japan and four parts favorable to China. Each part expresses emotions too much, and there are points of deliberately expanding and criticizing facts. For example, the chapter describing the historical relationship between China and Japan in Manchuria regards the politics practiced by England, the United States, and France in their own colonies as inappropriate for Japan. The Foreign Ministry intends to list specific examples one by one and compare them with the colonial policies of various countries to resolutely refute them. (2) Japan has no choice but to oppose the entire conclusion of the report. In particular, the report does not recognize Japan's right to station troops in Manchuria in the future. This proves that the investigation team is completely ignorant of Japan's special historical relationship in Manchuria and the current state of security in Manchuria. The army seems to refute this point.</p>
<h3>The Strict Security of Geneva</h3>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 2nd - The strict security surrounding the Lytton Investigation Report here has not been seen since the Versailles Peace Treaty negotiations. League of Nations officials, clerks, translators, and others were uneasy all night, fearing that the investigation team's recommendations would be leaked, resulting in liability. News reporters were busy all night, hoping that someone would leak the information, so that they could get the secret news exclusively. Anyone in the League of Nations who handled the report had to sign a pledge to maintain confidentiality, and people were sent to monitor them closely. It is reported that people have often tried to bribe translators and printers, willing to offer bribes of at least 50 yuan and up to 60,000 yuan, but due to strict supervision, there was no opportunity to take advantage of. The secretary should immediately send the manuscript to the fourteen directors, which is contrary to the usual practice of sending the manuscript in advance, and will send it at the same time when it is released to news reporters at 1:00 PM today. As for the Lausanne printing house, police guards are stationed there at all times. There are various rumors about the recommendations from the outside world, but they have not been formally confirmed or denied. Reuters, Geneva, 2nd - People here generally regard the Lytton Report as clearly beneficial to the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Abridged Notes on Two Conversations Between the Japanese Foreign Minister and the Investigation Team</p>
<h3>Any Link Between China and Manchuria Will Never Be Allowed to Exist</h3>
<p>Japan Admits that the Puppet Organization is a Prelude to Future Annexation</p>
<p>First Conversation</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 1st - This news agency has obtained abridged notes from responsible sources on two conversations between Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida and members of the investigation team in July of this year. They are published below in question-and-answer format. "Uchida": Japan's recognition of Manchuria does not violate any treaty, and in matters relating to national defense, the opinions of others cannot be considered. "US Member, McCoy": Your country has repeatedly mentioned national defense, Japan's survival, and the right of the Manchurian people to self-determination, but the results of the investigation team's on-site inspection prove that the issue of the people's right to self-determination is not worth mentioning. As for the threat to Japan's interests in Manchuria, it can be asserted that it does not exist. Furthermore, the actions of the Chinese on the night of September 18th cannot be considered the key, and the Chinese army had received orders not to attack Japan in any way, as you know well. China and the Soviet Union also have interests related to their survival in Manchuria, which must be taken into account. The rest of the world believes that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" will violate the League of Nations Covenant, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. "Uchida": Japan attaches great importance to world public opinion and the position it occupies in international relations, but as far as Japan is concerned, the only way to resolve this problem is to recognize "Manchukuo," which is what the entire country demands. "Uchida, in response to a question from French Member, Kraut": Any link between Manchuria and China cannot be allowed to exist, even a theoretical link cannot be recognized. This kind of link only allows China to restore its old situation in Manchuria. Regardless of the nature of the link, no country knows China better than Japan. Japan has also tested China's promises, and China and the Soviet Union have often implemented aggressive policies against Japan in Manchuria. Japan is prepared to study all of China's proposals, but China must know that it should fundamentally abandon Manchuria. Once "Manchukuo" exists, Japan will consider it unnecessary to negotiate with China on the Manchurian issue. Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" does not violate the Nine-Power Treaty, because Manchukuo is not a signatory to the treaty. If Japan annexes Manchuria, then the situation will be different. "Uchida also said": If the Japanese advisers in Manchukuo are not satisfactory, Japan will replace them.</p>
<h3>Second Conversation</h3>
<p>"Uchida": What I said about the Japanese government being able to replace "Manchukuo" officials was a mistake. Japan can only recommend better new officials to "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>The investigation team asked Uchida about the legal status of the Japanese army. Uchida replied that he did not know well and needed to ask the Ministry of the Army. "Italian Member, Count Mako": Centuries ago, the Manchus did invade China, but to this day, the Manchus have been assimilated by the Chinese. "Uchida replied": Indeed, but Manchuria still exists. "Lytton": What exactly does your country mean by Manchuria? What are its boundaries? "Uchida": What our country means by Manchuria includes the four eastern provinces and Inner Mongolia. As for its boundaries, I cannot explain them precisely at present. The Treaty of Versailles had an example for the Polish border issue. "Lytton": Then what about the Open Door Policy? "Uchida": Japan will naturally maintain this principle in Manchuria. "Lytton": Japan should resolve its dispute with China peacefully in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations. "Uchida": What the League of Nations is doing is nothing more than making China understand that it cannot rely on the League of Nations or any great powers for assistance, and must abandon its dreams of Manchuria, and then reach a peaceful compromise with Japan on all other disputed issues. "McCoy": Japan declares that it is willing to take responsibility for maintaining peace in the Far East, but Japan has fought with Russia and China twice before. Is this how to maintain peace? Even today, Japan believes that in order to fulfill its responsibility for peace, it must use force. If this is the case, then it would be better to let the League of Nations maintain peace by peaceful means. "Uchida": Japan has great faith in the League of Nations, but no matter what, Japan cannot entrust its responsibilities to the League of Nations, and the Manchurian issue cannot be resolved without recognizing "Manchukuo." This is certain and unchangeable. "Uchida replied to Lytton's question": After the Chinese authorities left Manchuria, those in charge of Manchuria requested Japan to take over the Chinese railways there. "Lytton": Japan's rights and interests in Manchuria are based on the 1905 and 1915 treaties. So how will these treaties be handled? Also, it is said that your country intends to conclude a special treaty with Manchukuo regarding this matter. "Uchida" replied that these treaties, within the scope of their relationship with Manchuria, should be recognized by "Manchukuo." "Lytton": But what about the other clauses in these treaties that are related to China itself? Can China consider them to remain in effect? "Uchida replied": This question remains to be studied. Total Japanese Navy Budget</p>
<h3>Exceeds 500 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Tsuushin, Tokyo, 2nd - The Navy's budget for the eighth year of Showa was submitted by the Navy Ministry to the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning, requesting a total of 487 million yuan, of which 277 million yuan was newly requested. Other Manchurian Incident expenses and the Second Supplementary Plan according to the London Naval Treaty are still under review by the Navy Ministry. It is reported that the Navy will request 60 to 70 million yuan for the first year of continuing projects last year. As a result, the total Navy budget for the next year will reach more than 500 million yuan. The Navy said that all the items requested are necessary for the urgency of the current situation and must be fully approved. The important items for which additional amounts are requested are as follows: (1) 20 million yuan for the revival of military expenses for the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents; (1) 25 million yuan for the improvement and enrichment of the content based on the actual results of the two incidents; (1) 50 million yuan for the enrichment of the content of the established plan; (1) 30 million yuan for the enrichment of the content of air force power.</p>
<p>Speech by Ambassador Guo in the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo's Speech</h3>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 2nd - Today, during the discussion of the report of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Chinese representative Guo Taiqi delivered a speech, praising the merits of the late French Foreign Minister Briand, and then declared that the League of Nations is facing an uncertain situation, which can not only save Manchuria for China, but also ensure the security of the League of Nations in the world. He hoped that the Manchurian incident would establish a new principle in international law, which is the principle of not recognizing the results of aggression, which was proposed by the US government on January 7th and unanimously approved by the League of Nations on January 11th. Because the interdependence of all countries in the world does not need to be proven, I sincerely hope that what my country has suffered can serve as a lesson for others and open the door to a true understanding of pain in the world in the future, and declare the necessary trend of this development in international law. Then, he expressed his gratitude to the League of Nations committees and private organizations for assisting China in disaster relief, facilitating transportation, and organizing intellectual cooperation. Finally, he summarized China's attitude towards reducing armaments, saying that among all the countries in the world, none is more eager than China to see the issue of disarmament reach an agreement. However, China also knows that the issue of national armaments and national security are closely linked. The Chinese people are extremely unwilling to engage in war, so they earnestly appeal to the League of Nations and the conscience of the world, asking for action to be taken so that the threat to their national independence and territorial integrity can be given a fair and appropriate resolution.</p>
<h3>Gunshots in Front of the League of Nations Venue</h3>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 1st - A doctor of law named Bude, who is 42 years old, stood on the Wilson Quay opposite the League of Nations and fired a shot from a handgun at a meeting room of the League of Nations. At that time, the Fourth Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly was holding a meeting in the meeting room, with more than 100 members, as well as news reporters and many people in the audience. Fortunately, the bullet did not injure anyone. The perpetrator was immediately arrested and is a Hungarian. Kokuminsha, Geneva, 2nd - The Hungarian who fired a gun at the entrance of the League of Nations last night is a lawyer. Because he was refused to issue an identity document, which threatened his livelihood, he fired the gun, hoping that the international community would pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Arrives in Paris</p>
<h3>Remarks to the Press</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd - China's new ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, arrived here at 8:00 this morning and made a statement to the "Strong Item Newspaper", saying that Paris was his old haunt, and he was very happy to come here with a festival. Ambassador Gu also said that there are quite a few overseas Chinese in Paris, and he is willing to do his best to help them. He said, "Since I arrived in Europe, I have been asked by people from all walks of life about the situation of Chinese society and politics, and I find it very difficult to answer. China is a great country, and the four borders are peaceful. Although there have been differences of opinion in domestic affairs in recent years, the strife within the walls has been able to stop itself because of the increasing foreign troubles. The so-called foreign troubles are Japan's attack on Manchuria. Our only hope is to strengthen friendly relations with all countries and to actively participate in peace organizations. We are especially eager for the world to recover and prosper. Unexpectedly, just when our country was using all its strength to restore its national economy, a foreign country invaded its territory and obstructed it. Some people talk about recognizing 'Manchukuo'. What are they talking about? This is an irregular thing. We will resolutely protest, and we consider this matter absolutely invalid. Fortunately, the League of Nations has accepted this matter, and we are only waiting for its discussion, and we sincerely hope that our appeal to this great international organization will not be in vain."</p>

<p>Jinan Communication, After Liu Zhennian abandoned Fushan, Zhaoyuan, Xunxian and other places, he concentrated his forces in Yexian and Laiyang. Liu himself defended Yexian to resist the provincial army, while He Yisan was responsible for defending Laiyang. A few days ago, according to reports from all parties, He Yisan had concentrated the grain and rice in the villages near Laiyang in one place and actively prepared fortifications to plan for a long defense. On the provincial army side, the 87th Brigade, Rong Guangxing, advanced eastward from Pingdu, the Lunan militia, Xie Shuxian, advanced south from Zhaoyuan, and the Ludong militia, Zhao Mingyuan, had already been near Laiyang. The provincial government received a report last night that Rong, Xie, and Zhao's three units had surrounded Laiyang. The strength of He Yisan's troops in the city is only five regiments, and it is expected that it will be difficult to last. As for the Yexian side, according to the refugees who escaped from the city to the provincial government, Liu's army has been driving strong men to dig tunnels to the north of the city in order to steal from the provincial army. It is planned to dig twenty li, and now it has become three li. It turned out that Liu Xing and Zhang Zongchang used tunnel soldiers to win when they fought in the eighteenth year. Liu's houses were hit by bullets and caught fire, and all the thatched houses in the city have been completely demolished. Also, fearing that the shells would explode easily when they hit hard objects, they ordered soldiers to cover the stone roads with grass and dig holes in the ground to avoid bullets. Now the city is in great chaos, the soldiers are not in teams during the day and do not return to camp at night, and there is no discipline. (September 30)</p>
<p>Lu Person, Liang Zuoyou</p>
<h3>Willing to Donate 30 Million Yuan in Assets</h3>
<p>Han Fuqu Has Sent Him to Beijing</p>
<p>To Connect with Government Authorities</p>
<p>Jinan Communication, Liang Zuoyou, courtesy name Renpeng, is a native of Liangjia Township, the eighth district of Huangxian, Shandong. He recently came to Jinan from his native place and met with Han Fuqu to state that he was willing to donate 30 million yuan of his family property to the country for the purpose of resisting Japan and suppressing the communists. Mr. Han was very encouraging and introduced him to Jiang Jieshi's representative, Jiang Bocheng. Jiang immediately telegraphed the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, He Yingqin, and the Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen, reporting everything. He received a reply by telegram, ordering Liang to go to Beijing to negotiate. This morning (30th), Liang took a servant and drove to Beijing from Jinan. Han specially bought two first-class passenger tickets and gave them to him. Before the car arrived, Liang sat in the waiting room of the station. I once met him. Liang is about thirty years old, with a round face and a hunched back. He was wearing an old blue cloth gown. According to his talk, his assets are about 30 million yuan in major commercial ports. Now, because the national crisis is serious and the Red bandits are rampant, the national treasury is having difficulty supporting all anti-Japanese and communist suppression expenses. Therefore, I am willing to destroy my family to help the country. Each other's luggage contains a plan to present to Minister He and Minister Song, advocating that 20% of this asset be used to pay military salaries, resist Japan and suppress the communists, and 20% be used for disaster relief. It is important to help the victims, but because it is consumption, only allocate this number. The remaining 60% will be used to repair railways and develop industry, etc. During the conversation, the car had already entered the station, and Liang boarded the car, rewarding the tea room three corners and the baggage handler one corner. His demeanor was not like that of a wealthy man. When asked for details, he was unwilling to disclose much. Whether there are other hidden circumstances is still unknown. (September 30)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Outbreak of Plague in Zhujia Bridge Zhujia Bridge near Wuku is a village with many residents. Recently, there has been a sudden death from the plague, and the infection has spread rapidly in a few days, with as many as two or three lower people. They died without rescue. Zhang Shaoxiu, the director of Songjiang Hospital, believes that the villagers have simple knowledge and often seek gods and divination after the onset of the disease, resulting in the loss of treatment. He is particularly pitiful and personally led doctors to carry the main treatment drugs to the countryside for treatment yesterday, hoping to put out the plague early.</p>
<p>Test Run on the Songhu County Road The Songwei Road is connected to the Huming Road for automobile traffic. It was originally scheduled to open on the 10th of this month. The Weiqiao connecting Songhu is under active construction. Today (2nd), a test run was conducted. Mr. Yin Shisheng took a car from the Shanghai Procuratorate and arrived in Songjiang at 4 o'clock. There were three cars. After a short stop of about 20 minutes, in addition to two cars staying in Song, there was still one that drove back to Shanghai. Because Weiqiao had not been completed, he had to cross the river to return to Shanghai. The road was very smooth, and the test run results were good.</p>

<p>Opposing the Water Conservancy Levy on Mu and Donation of Jiangsu Construction Department Last year, many rivers were dredged, and there was a lack of funds. In the twentieth year, the tax on water conservancy mu and donation was levied in Chang, at five cents per mu, which was a huge amount. At that time, it was all transferred to the province. This is the twenty-first year and is about to be collected, and the Construction Department intends to levy this water conservancy mu and donation by analogy. However, this county has suffered consecutive water disasters and wars, and its vitality has not recovered. Donations and expenses have not yet been found to make up for it. This year, we are planning to use this tax to repay the previous expenses and military expenses, and the remainder will be allocated to the defense groups in each district. If the Construction Department takes it away, not only will there be no local funds to make up for it, but the defense group will also have to be suspended. Therefore, local people and various agencies are now opposing this move by the Construction Department.</p>

<p>National Language Curriculum Standard Review Committee (2)</p>
<p>The Middle School National Language Curriculum Standard Review Committee, convened by the Ministry of Education, continued to meet at the Ministry of Education on the 1st. More than ten committee members attended, chaired by Counselor Wu Shuchang. The committee discussed the junior high school national language curriculum. A standard of nine points was specifically agreed upon for extracurricular supplementary reading. Although the full text has not been approved and is inconvenient to announce, the main points of the supplementary reading materials are: (1) biographies of Chinese and foreign celebrities and systematic historical records; (2) annotated selections of famous works; (3) ancient and modern sayings and recent lecture records; (4) ancient and modern letters; (5) travel notes, diaries, and notebooks; (6) selections of current songs; (7) essays and novels; (8) operas; (9) periodicals. The teaching methods for junior high school were discussed and revised more practically and applied. Many supplements were added regarding student composition and examination scores. More than twenty scholars from Beijing and other places with rich experience in national language, such as Chen Yinque, Huang Jie, Yang Jifo, and Qian Jibo, contributed their opinions in writing to the committee. The committee also telegraphed famous people in the country to join the discussion. There are also issues such as improving the treatment of junior high school national language teachers, regulating class sizes, and editing supplementary reading materials, which will be discussed after the Monday and Tuesday meetings (on Sunday, the Ministry of Education will host the committee members to visit scenic spots), and then the high school curriculum will continue to be discussed. Although the seven-item outline of the junior high school teaching materials and new standards has not yet reached the approval and publication stage, according to interviews with committee members, the seven revised items are extremely valuable. A brief overview is recorded below: (1) those that conform to the Chinese party-state system and policies; (2) those that contain the meaning of arousing national spirit and improving the social situation; (3) those that contain the common knowledge and thoughts that citizens should possess without violating the trends of the times; (4) those that conform to real life and the developmental process of students' minds and bodies without being frivolous or decadent, or having a negative or world-weary tone; (5) those that narrate clearly, reason thoroughly, describe truthfully, and express sincerely; (6) those that have clear punctuation, harmonious rhythm, and no grammatical or logical errors; (7) those whose style can serve as a model and can promote students' skills.</p>

<h3>Chen Heqin and Others Reply to Wang Zhirui and Others' Letter</h3>
<p>Regarding the Misunderstanding Arising from Improving Elementary School Textbooks</p>
<p>Chen Heqin and others replied to Wang Zhirui and others' letter, saying: Mr. Zhirui, we read the education news in the Shen Bao on September 29 and learned of your letter to Heqin, in which you state that our document says, "Entrusting indigent copyists who have no other means of livelihood, limiting their work by time constraints, only seeking to plagiarize old books, quickly completing the books, disregarding the needs of the times and children's psychology, and having no ideals or goals," which is interpreted as condemning and insulting lower-class textbook writers, which is quite astonishing.</p>
<p>We also appreciate the writing of textbooks and may have been employed. Therefore, the document contains phrases such as "We may have been engaged in writing work...understanding the malpractices in this field..." Even if it is said to be condemnation or insult, it is nothing more than self-confession and self-blame. Moreover, the so-called "copyists" and "no means of livelihood" are as you say in your letter, "No means of livelihood, is it also related to knowledge and friendship...? Wielding a pen and working, why be ashamed of being employed?" To view it as an insult and to point to it as a derogatory term is incomprehensible. As for "only seeking" and "unwilling," they do not refer to the writers. The meaning of the text is very clear. Speaking from our experience, the editing of textbooks is often restricted and controlled by others, "only seeking" and "unwilling," so there are those who "pour out their heart's blood," but the result is still unsatisfactory. This is not the fault of the writers, but there are others who are responsible. Our words are precisely to defend the writers, but they are instead pointed to as condemnation, which can be said to be a great misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Our government's purpose is to improve elementary school textbooks, but it is also for the benefit of the writers themselves. Therefore, the original text contains "Those who receive manuscript fees or salaries, new works published after August 22nd, should be given some royalties" (according to this, it has been deleted when published). Your letter says, "Encouraging private writing...we strongly agree," which shows that there is no contradictory intention between us regarding the general content of the document. Please do not take things out of context and hastily accuse us.</p>
<p>We are all pen pushers with no means of livelihood. We should unite and save ourselves. If we disregard our own interests and quarrel among ourselves, disrupting our ranks, not only will we be laughed at by others, but it will also be like a strike among workers who beat each other, and onlookers may suspect that there are others provoking discord. Finally, it should be stated that we are fully responsible for the document submitted, and although Heqin is the lead signatory, the responsibility does not lie solely with Heqin. Please do not hold only Heqin responsible. We respectfully offer this reply. Respectfully, Chen Heqin, Jiang, Xi Cen, Ma Ketan, Li Qingsong, Shi Renfu, Hu Shuyi, Yi Keju, and others.</p>

<h3>The New Building of the Municipal Songjiang High School is Completed</h3>
<p>Most of the buildings of the Municipal Wusong High School were destroyed by fire in the Battle of Shanghai. The school resumed this semester, and the Municipal Education Bureau specifically invited bids to build new buildings. The project was completed the day before yesterday. The school principal, Cheng Kuanzheng, is deeply saddened by the past and encourages the future with the completion of the new building. It seems to have a commemorative meaning, so today (3rd) after the memorial week in the morning, the opening ceremony of the new building will be held. There is a couplet in front of the building that says: "The school building is rebuilt and music continues to be played, the country's share has not been reported, and it is difficult to forget food and sleep." This also fully shows the depth of the commemorative significance. It is heard that from this week, all the temporary classrooms formerly rented from the Medical College of Central University will be moved back to the new building.</p>

<h3>Equally Matched</h3>
<p>Jinan and Lancashire</p>
<p>Jinan Lacks Practice and Coordination is Poor</p>
<p>Lost to Lancashire 1-2 Yesterday</p>
<p>Lancashire Team's Ball Skills Have No Special Advantages</p>
<p>Jinan, a member of the Westerners' Football Association's Group A, and the Lancashire team of the British Army, had a friendly match at Yiyuan yesterday. Both teams were trying out their skills for the first time, so the lineup was disorganized and no special performances were seen. In the first half, Lancashire won by two goals. In the second half, Jinan's Mei Hongbao used an extremely fast shot to score a goal. As a result, Jinan lost to Lancashire by one to two. Three to four thousand people watched.</p>
<p>Jinan has good talent and is well-balanced inside and outside, but lacks coordination, which is its only shortcoming. It should practice more to develop defense and offense strategies. Jiang Shanqing and Gu Shangdong's two inside guards missed a lot of balls, which should be avoided as much as possible. The avant-garde is excellent. Xu Yahui goes back and forth appropriately. The forwards' shooting is inaccurate and there are many wild balls, so they should pay more attention. As for Lancashire, although they won, their ball skills did not really seem to be better than Jinan's.</p>
<p>Two Goals Lost Due to Carelessness in the Front Field</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, Jinan gained the advantage of kicking off and launched a fierce attack. Qian Ruisheng had a chance to shoot, but it became a wild ball. Chen Zhenhe dribbled the ball single-handedly and advanced, rushing into no man's land, thinking it would be easy to succeed, but he unexpectedly kicked the ball too far and was rescued by the opposing goalkeeper. Lancashire immediately launched a counterattack, also seeking success. Jinan's Luo Haiguang and Qian Ruisheng attacked the goal first, but both failed. In the melee, at 35 minutes, the British army's right wing sent a high ball to Jinan's goal. At that time, the sunlight was forcing the goalkeeper Xie Quanhe's eyes, and he lost the ball, falling on the foot of the British army's left inside forward, who immediately shot. The ball then touched the body of his teammate, the center forward, who turned around and shot again, and the ball entered the goal. Jinan lost a goal. Lancashire's momentum was boosted. In less than five minutes, the right wing dribbled the ball and rushed to the front of the goal. Gu Shangdong tried to stop his action but could not, and he was attacked into the goal. Jinan then lost two goals. Jinan's vitality was greatly damaged at this point, so they quickly resisted. Luo Haiguang's two headers were ineffective and ultimately unproductive. The first half ended with Lancashire winning 2-0.</p>
<p>Small Plum Scores a Miraculous Victory in the Back Field</p>
<p>After the break, Jinan's Zhuang Shihong rested due to foot pain, and Yun Feng substituted. Jinan had the ambition to gain the upper hand and launched a direct attack on the British army's nest. Chen Zhenhe sent the ball to the left, and Liu Zukan took a few steps forward and shot quickly in front of the goal. The ball landed and rolled away. Luo Haiguang and the British army's left inside guard rushed up and both missed the ball. Mei Hongbao caught up and kicked hard, and the ball shot into the net like an arrow from a bow, its momentum extremely sharp and clear. The audience praised endlessly and the applause thundered. After this goal, the British army attacked Jinan's goal again and the center forward shot fiercely. Xie Quanhe made a wonderful save to defuse the danger, winning the audience's cheers. From then on, Jinan's forwards advanced together and occasionally visited the Lancashire team's goal. There were many opportunities to attack the goal, but unfortunately there were too many wild balls, and their goalkeeper was steady and there was no gap to take advantage of. After repeated attacks and defenses, no results were established. The battle was chaotic, and the spiritual color appeared from time to time. As a result, Lancashire won 2-1. The lineup is as follows (listed in order):</p>
<p>Lancashire</p>
<p>Pa Er</p>
<p>Jiekesi</p>
<p>William Wei Yierluoke</p>
<p>Haiermu Simisi Laodun</p>
<p>Maike Duhuoer Baensi</p>
<p>Bi De</p>
<p>Kai Si</p>
<p>Jinan Team</p>
<p>Liang Shutang Liu Zukan</p>
<p>Gu Shangdong</p>
<p>Xu Yahui Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Zhuang Shihong Qian Ruisheng</p>
<p>Jiang Shanqing Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>(Yun Feng substituted)</p>
<h3>Weidexi Football Tie With French Business</h3>
<p>Result 3-3</p>
<p>Members of the Westerners' Football Association's Group A, the Weidexi and French Business football teams, had a friendly match at Yiyuan last Saturday (1st). In the first half, French Business won 2-0. In the second half, French Business scored another goal. Weidexi was awarded a penalty kick, which was saved by the French Business goalkeeper. Afterwards, Gan Dexi actually scored three consecutive goals, creating an undefeated tie. Most of the French Business players were Portuguese team players (this year's Portuguese team news), and the South American national championship team player Toutai was appointed as inside guard. Their strength is not weak.</p>
<p>Qiu and Lin Retain Public Doubles Tennis Championship</p>
<h3>|Three Consecutive Wins|</h3>
<p>Won Deffett Whit Straight Sets Yesterday in the Final of this Year's Grass Tennis Tournament</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua won again in the Shanghai Open Doubles final yesterday, defeating their strong opponent Deffett Whit in straight sets, retaining the championship for the third year, with scores of 6-3, 8-6, 6-4.</p>
<h3>Swept All Grass Championships</h3>
<p>This year's men's championships of the Shanghai Grass Tennis Association have all fallen into the hands of Chinese players thanks to the efforts of Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin, which can be called a new record. Although it is the glory of the two gentlemen, it is also the supreme glory of our Chinese people. The three major men's championships are: (1) the International Robert Cup, won against England's Deffett Whit in the final; (2) the Men's Singles final, Qiu Feihai won against the defending champion Deffett; (3) yesterday's Men's Doubles final, Qiu and Lin won against Deffett Whit again.</p>
<p>Five Consecutive Games Like a Hot Knife Through Butter</p>
<p>After the Women's Singles final, the four players appeared. Deffett served first, scoring four points in a row. Qiu and Lin rotated one game, and Lin Baohua continued to serve, scoring three points in a row with a cannonball-style ball, winning the second game with a score of 4-2. Then, he was unstoppable, like a hot knife through butter, and won five consecutive games, making the score 5-1, and winning the first set 6-2 first.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Momentum is Fierce, Counterattack Wins Again</p>
<p>The situation in the second set, because of Whit's sudden progress and improved performance, was gradually relaxed. The opponent took the lead, 3-2, 5-3, and was about to take the second set. Lin Baohua shook his arm at this point and broke Deffett's serve in front of the net, making the score 5-4. Then Lin served, winning four points in a row, and the bad situation turned into a 5-5 tie. The opponent took the lead again with 6-5, but Lin and Qiu scored three consecutive games again, winning the second set 8-6, and the situation was largely settled.</p>
<p>Breaking the Dangerous Situation Again, Consummation is Achieved</p>
<p>Although Qiu and Lin had a 2-0 lead, in the third set that would determine the outcome, the enemy's momentum was still rampant. Deffett Whit was threatening, 3-1, 4-2. The seventh game was the key to victory. The enemy got 5-2, and Qiu and Lin got 4-3, not far apart. Whit served, and Qiu and Lin broke it in one fell swoop, and the situation turned around. The next game was Lin's serve, and he won four more games in a row, and the consummation was achieved, winning the third set 6-4.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua's Net Skills</p>
<p>Yesterday's victory relied on Lin's serve, which scored a lot of points, but the net skills were also the fatal injury of the enemy. Lin's singles may not be able to dominate now, but doubles should still be emphasized without a doubt. His crisp and interesting light shots in front of the net made the opponent cry out in vain. What is lacking is that Lin and Qiu's pressing in front of the net can still be exerted, and they have not yet made people feel their爽快. Deffett was completely reduced in strength. The reason why he was able to resist stubbornly was because Whit's performance was suddenly outstanding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fojiesh Wins the Women's Singles Championship</p>
<p>Before the doubles final, there was first the women's singles final, between two Russian women, Mrs. Fojiesh and Mrs. Klenov. Fojie was the singles champion of Harbin, and Ke was the previous champion, Miss Feisi, so there was very little difference in technique. Therefore, the entanglement could not be untied. Fojie's forehand draw was exceptionally powerful and wonderful, and the victory was mostly based on this. As a result, she won the championship in two sets to one, 6-3, 8-6. In the second set, Fojie was ahead 5-3, and later lost 6-8, which was a pity.</p>
<p>The Grass Tennis Season Comes to an End</p>

<p>Friendly Football Match</p>
<h3>Donghua Smashes French Business</h3>
<p>Result of Seven to One</p>
<p>French Business Team's Lineup is Incomplete</p>
<p>Donghua Sent Out Troops, Military Appearance is Grand</p>
<p>Similar to the Golden Age of Sanyu Lehua in the Past</p>
<p>Yesterday, they had a friendly match with the French Business team at the China Baseball Field. The French Business team is one of the Group A teams this year. At first, there was no borrowed name. Since the 3-3 draw with Lincoln and Weidexia, people have looked at it with admiration. Under the clash, Donghua won a big victory with seven to one. The victory agreed with expectations, but the difference was so great that it was not without surprise.</p>
<p>Reasons for French Business Team's Great Defeat</p>
<p>The French Business team that played yesterday was not a formal lineup. For example, the goalkeeper Fularuo, the inside guard Tuotai, the avant-garde Remidi, and the forward Larsen were all absent, and were replaced by reserve troops. How could such an incomplete team compete with the invincible Donghua? It is appropriate to submit to the iron hooves of Donghua and be slaughtered at will. Donghua's team hit the egg with a stone. Donghua's team took advantage of the windward and anti-Japanese benefits at the beginning of the game, and was able to use its strengths to break the enemy. It was no accident that they scored five goals in the first forty-five minutes. The performance in the second half was not as urgent as in the first half, perhaps because they did not want to embarrass people too much. Hitting an egg with a stone can represent the situation of the two teams at that time.</p>
<p>Suddenly There Was a Scare</p>
<p>Referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle to declare war. Donghua frequently probed the enemy's camp. Wan Xianghua was the first to shoot, but the foot was inaccurate and went out of bounds. French Business counterattacked. Kolai passed the ball. Bashan Tuo and Zhou Xianyan mutually clashed to grab the ball. Zhou fell to the ground and the ball rolled to the right side. The dragon gate was empty. Fafosha was too impatient and hit the wooden post, bounced back and hit it again, towards the sky. A scare, almost scaring the audience.</p>
<p>Two Goals in Five Minutes</p>
<p>Under the fierce attack of Donghua, they always lingered within the enemy's inside guard line without getting their way. Twenty minutes had passed. Li Yichen received Feng Yunyou's pass, and Fei Ma rushed into the enemy's camp. In the blink of an eye, the ball went from Li to Chen Yutian, and with a bang, the enemy pass fell. Chen Yutian triumphantly returned in triumph. Unexpectedly, the enemy general immediately launched a counterattack, three or four passes, and the center suddenly shot. Zhou Xianyan was prepared early and fell to the ground, grabbing the outside with both hands. If it were someone else, it would be difficult to protect it. The three armies used their lives to turn danger into safety. Wu Youliang dribbled the ball out and passed it to the front. Li Yichen attacked the pass on horseback and hit another goal. The two goals were scored in just five minutes. Then, the enemy goalkeeper fouled, and the entire team lined up in a line to resist. Donghua was unable to get what they wanted and retreated.</p>
<p>The First Half Became Five to One</p>
<p>The French Business team tried repeatedly without success and was not disappointed. First, they invaded from the right, and then fought in the middle. In the chaotic shadows of the feet, Leijier suddenly released a hidden arrow. Zhou was too late to resist, and they lost the pass, making the score two to one. After the French Business team got a goal, the military momentum was scattered. Li Yichen benefited from the fisherman's profit, Chen Hongguang was quick in body and foot, and each hit a goal. Before the break, Tu Kaiyuan passed the ball and gained power, and Li Yichen hit another goal. The first half became five to one.</p>
<p>One-Sided and Two More Goals Were Added</p>
<p>In the second half, the interest of the viewers and the spirit of the kickers were not as good as before. It was also because the strength of the enemy was not as good as ours, so how could it arouse tense emotions? Chen Yutian sent it from the right flank, the goalkeeper left the position to save, Chen Hongguang rose up to compete. The high ball sagged and touched Hongguang's knee, and slowly rolled towards the net. Donghua then occupied the light with six to one. After that, both armies did not have any special long performances. In the last ten minutes, Chen Hongguang once again rushed into the enemy with an agile foot, creating a seven-to-one one-sided result.</p>

<h3>New Basketball Techniques (7) (Original by Claire Burcky)</h3>
<p>(Reprinted) Jointly translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Shooting is the objective of a basketball game, like scoring in soccer, and circling the bases in baseball. When a player gets the ball through the hoop from above to below, it counts as points.</p>
<p>Each legal shot counts as two points. The offense in basketball is to find ways for players to pass the ball closer to the basket, as the chances of scoring are higher there than from the half-court line.</p>
<p>Free throws are a penalty for fouls. It is a free shot that the other party cannot obstruct, and must be taken from the free-throw line 15 feet away from the backboard's vertical line. Each successful free throw counts as one point.</p>
<p>Each team's defensive zone is the backcourt. Its offensive target is the basket at the opposite end. If Team A throws a ball into Team B's basket, even if this is a rare occurrence, Team B should receive two points. No matter how much the player who accidentally threw the ball apologizes, it is invalid.</p>

<p>Spot Gold Fluctuates Indecisively Last Week</p>
<p>｜Mexico Considers Returning to Gold Standard by Absorbing Cash｜</p>
<p>｜Swap Premium Narrows Gradually, But Not Completely Eliminated｜</p>
<p>Spot gold prices fluctuated indecisively last week, with the trend continuing to be good. However, the complex overseas silver market caused gold prices to rise and fall intermittently, but without any major movements. The daily difference was at most six to seven taels. The supply and demand from all parties was erratic, and people felt confused, as if lost in a fog. The opening price fell by 2.6 qian to 728.2 qian. This was because the silver market had little activity, affecting the rise in the futures quotes. Subsequently, the near-term and forward silver prices diverged because the local drafts strengthened, so the price moved forward again, then weakened and hovered around 730 taels, advancing and retreating rapidly. By Thursday, both domestic and foreign market conditions eased, and large speculators heavily sold off, causing the gold price to suddenly fall to 726.6 taels. The next day, it suddenly soared, mainly because the silver market continued to lengthen, the US bank did not change its private telegrams, and forward prices plummeted. Moreover, news that Mexico was vigorously purchasing cash to prepare for returning to the gold standard also contributed. This caused the gold price to almost break through the 740 taels mark, reaching 739.5 taels (the gross price of goods was even shouted above 40 taels). However, arbitrageurs came to sell because the arbitrage price was still favorable, and many parties took the opportunity to sell. Furthermore, as the drafts were not too tight, banks were willing to sell, and the price did not have the ability to rise further. Finally, the British and American silver prices diverged, the market turned weak, and once returned to the 730 taels mark, ultimately settling at 732-33 taels. In summary, compared to the previous Saturday, it rose again by 1.2 qian. The total difference for the week was only 12.9 qian, already rising for five consecutive weeks, accumulating 49 taels. The difference between the opening and closing prices was an increase of 3.8 qian. The central bank continued to absorb spot gold, but the red bar initially increased by 4.5 taels, then frequently decreased to only 10.05 qian. The premium for swapping October for November gradually narrowed from 5 taels to 1.5 taels. There were still many that had not been completely swapped. The total amount for November was approximately 25,000 bars, so neither the bulls nor the bears held large amounts. As for the British and American silver markets, they continued to fall. The Shanghai market's draft situation was mediocre. The initial listing price leveled out, and the US dollar only retracted by 125, but internally they were the same, with slight rotation. Chinese merchants initially bought and then sold. There were many arbitrage transactions in between. The British and American exchange rates frequently fell, and later slightly widened. The British to American rate fell by another point, and the American exchange rate rose slightly by 375. Now, the high and low prices of British and American silver prices and draft prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Type Highest Lowest Change from Previous Saturday</p>
<p>Large Bar (Near Term) 17 pence 18125 17 pence 6875 Down 0625</p>
<p>Large Bar (Forward) 17 pence 9375 17 pence 8125 Down 0625</p>
<p>US Silver Price 27 cents 5 27 cents 375 Down 125</p>
<p>Mumbai 56 rupees 025 55 rupees 11 No Change</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate (Official) 1 shilling 8 pence 875 1 shilling pence 75 No Change</p>
<p>US Exchange Rate (Official) 30 yuan 125 29 yuan 815 Down 125</p>
<p>Spot Gold 719 taels 5 qian 726 taels 6 qian Up 1.2 qian</p>
<h3>Sunday Silver Dollar Market Exceptionally Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and all Chinese and foreign banks were closed for business, so trading was exceptionally quiet and there were no major fluctuations. The morning premium price was 6 qian 9 fen 6 li 2 hao 5 si, and the afternoon price was 6 qian 9 fen 6 li 1 hao 2 hu 5 si, slightly higher than the previous day by 2 hao 5 si. The total amount of drafts traded was 470,000 in the morning and 130,000 in the afternoon. There were no transactions in banknotes at all. The silver interest rate was the same in both the morning and afternoon, at 2%. The amount of draft transactions was over 4.8 million in the morning and 500,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon, it was over 300,000. The total amount for small exchanges was 500,000. The amount of silver public bills collected was over 27 million. The amount of foreign public bills traded was over 4.1 million. The amount of small money house transactions was over 300,000. The amount of remittances from various routes was over 400,000. The price of subsidiary coins: the morning price for Jiangnan small foreign coins was 6 qian 0 li 3 si, and the afternoon price was 6 qian 0 li 4 si. The transactions were 5,500 jiao in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon. The morning price for Guangdong small foreign coins was 5 qian 8 fen 9 li, and the afternoon price was 5 qian 8 fen 8 li 7 hao 5 si. The transactions were 115,000 jiao in the morning and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins increased again by 500 wen, to 431,000. The amount of silver traded was 12,200 taels, equivalent to 52,582,000 wen in copper coins.</p>
<p>Securities: Bond Prices Rose by About One Yuan Last Week</p>
<p>The Market Was Slightly More Active Than Before</p>
<p>Transactions Reached 17.7 Million</p>
<p>During the week (from September 26th to October 1st), the spot market for various bonds on the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw minor fluctuations. Transactions totaled 49,500 yuan, with the 19 Customs bonds accounting for 10,000 yuan and other bonds only several thousand yuan. Due to the delivery of the September futures contract, there was only one day of trading at the beginning of the week, after which preparations were made for delivery. Although the November contract opened on Wednesday, there was no trading throughout. The October market was particularly good, with considerable trading every day. Except for Thursday, when the market was closed for delivery, Monday reached over 5.5 million, Friday totaled 4.6 million, and the weekend had over 3.7 million. The total transactions for the week were 17,767,500 yuan. Regarding changes, although there was no slight improvement in diplomatic relations with Japan, and the conflicts over the future of the Northeast were even greater, the domestic situation, such as the situation in Shandong, was unlikely to escalate, and bandit suppression was repeatedly reported as victorious. Therefore, although the surrounding environment was very quiet, and there were no new developments, the market sentiment was slightly better, and the easing of the money supply was also a factor driving investment. The buying from all parties was constantly stronger than the selling, and the sellers were waiting and watching, with no major sellers appearing, leading to a consistent trend of supply exceeding demand and prices firming. It is estimated that Monday rose by about 4 jiao, Tuesday slightly retracted, Wednesday rose by 7-8 jiao, and Friday after delivery saw the strongest increase, soaring by about 1 yuan. The scale of the fluctuations was unprecedented in recent months. The weekend saw mutual ups and downs, with minimal changes. In total, the fall for the week reached 2 yuan, with an increase of half a yuan to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous week. However, observing the situation of the bond market, it may temporarily return to calm. The following table lists the highest, lowest, and change in prices of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan; also, the price changes of the 20 Customs, Consolidated Tax, etc. in the table are calculated excluding the principal and interest of the previous period):</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Continues to be Sold Off in Small Quantities</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been uneventful for the past week, with a scattered atmosphere. Real demand from customer groups remains in the dark, with no major purchases. Small quantities of transactions continue. In addition, the overseas cotton market is also fluctuating indecisively, causing anxiety. However, general small sellers believe that although the domestic harvest is abundant and grain prices are low, farmers still struggle to make a living. It is expected that demand for spot yarn will remain weak, so the pressure to sell into the market is increasing. However, checks on the factories' remaining stock are low, so although the environment is bad, it can still resist for a while. It is difficult to be sure of what will happen in the future. Checks show that various customer groups bought a total of 4,137 bales. The market is stable. Spot yarn transactions for the entire week totaled 89,650 bales. The price changes for each month compared to the previous week are 2-3 qian. The purchase volume for each customer group is listed below:</p>
<p>Customer Group Bales Customer Group Bales Customer Group Bales Luzhou 95</p>

<h3>Large Fluctuations in Hankou Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market has seen relatively fast fluctuations in the past week. One reason is that prices are already in the middle range, capable of both rising and falling. The second reason is that the amount of short selling by large speculators is accumulating, and their intention is that the domestic climate is favorable, and new cotton is entering the market in large quantities. They are exploring the reasons for economic difficulties in various villages, and farmers are unable to hoard, so they are selling in large quantities. The amount is about 230-240,000 bales. The pressure is heavy. However, the general buyers intend that at this time last year, factories were busy ordering 300-400,000 bales of American and Indian cotton. The American and Indian cotton continued to arrive in Shanghai. This situation completely invalidates the calculation of foreign cotton prices. It is impossible to come to Shanghai. Another factor is that the current market is extremely sluggish, and the sources on the docks are increasing daily. However, checks on the goods arriving in Shanghai show that there is no large surplus, indicating that all factories lack goods and need them, so some buyers intend to buy when prices fall. As for the American cotton situation, it is also fluctuating indecisively, sometimes rising and sometimes falling. It is expected that it will be difficult to stabilize before the election of the head of state. The current cotton sales market is still bustling. Spot cotton transactions for the week totaled 4,938 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 13,210 bales of Yao flower cotton. American cotton fell by 30 pounds compared to last week. The purchase volume and prices of each factory are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Re-enters at 7 Fen Duty</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of major buyers, selling by Southern arbitrageurs, and unfavorable news from Liverpool. Futures fell by 20-29 points, and spot fell by 20 points. English cotton futures rose by 7-10 points, and spot rose by 14 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 20 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and disappointing news from Liverpool. Bengal rose by 5.15 rupees, Oomra rose by 5 rupees, and Broach rose by 5.25 rupees. (One-day telegram)</p>

<p>Grain: Rice Market Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were over 40 sources from South Shanghai, and the situation was completely depressed. The sales market on this street is increasingly sluggish. The price of new japonica rice, Yin Yuan glutinous rice, and Jiaobai pointed rice fell sharply by 3-4 jiao. New Du Yang pointed rice had no demand, and prices fell by 2 jiao. The market for Changxi Northern japonica rice saw no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still many boats arriving along the Suzhou River at Xinzha. Due to foreign rice squeezing the market and tight money supply, the rice cargo remains in abundance, and rice prices are steadily declining. There were very few people at the market in the morning. The price of both old and new white japonica rice fell by 3-4 jiao. Compared to this time last year, the price is now about 5 yuan higher.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: The Trend of Raw Sugar Whitening is Gradually Settling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association finalized the price. The price of 24-grade white raw sugar was initially called at 15 taels, but later traded at 14 taels 9 qian 5 fen for several hundred bags. Gao Zhuang called at 15 taels 0 qian 7 fen 5 li, but did not open. 20-grade medium white raw sugar was 14 taels 3 qian, 18-grade medium white raw sugar was 14 taels. Raw sugar was still called at 13 taels 2 qian. A batch of low-quality Longgang Blue sugar opened by the Chaozhou gang was lower in price than before, opening at 8 taels 8 qian to 6 qian. The Zhenxin factory opened dozens of bags of No. 2 medium-sized ice sugar at a price of 16 taels 2 qian.</p>

<h3>Silk Market Remained Lifeless Last Week</h3>
<p>The silk market in Shanghai remained lifeless last week. The world's economic situation is difficult to recover for the time being, and the instability of the European and American securities markets has had a negative impact on the silk market. Sales of silk fabrics are difficult to continue to be smooth. The sudden surge in European and American silk sales last month was purely the result of speculation. Therefore, it soon became quiet. However, general hoarders and silk weavers have thick stocks of silk, and the consumption of raw silk has not increased. New York, Lyon, and Hua silk factories saw sluggish sales last week, and prices continued to decline, especially in New York, where the decline was higher, falling by more than 2 jiao per pound, mainly because Japanese silk continued to fall. The Shanghai market was lonely and lifeless, and the labor strikes in silk factories have not been resolved, making the future even more bleak. A total of over 200 bales of spot silk were traded throughout the week, and over 600 bales were exported. The overseas market and Hua silk prices at the end of last week are listed below (New York price per pound in US dollars, Lyon price per kilogram in francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Morning Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>High-Grade Shanghai Filature 1.821 01 Top-Grade Dry Filature 1.266 0</p>
<p>Top-Grade Shanghai Filature 1.539 0 Medium-Grade Dry Filature 1.024 8</p>
<p>Medium-Grade Shanghai Filature 1.307 6 Low-Grade Dry Filature 0.883 3</p>
<p>Low-Grade Shanghai Filature 1.116 4 Top-Grade Large Filature 1.125 1</p>
<p>Top-Grade Shandong Filature 1.387 4 Low-Grade Large Filature 0.843 1</p>
<p>Top-Grade Sichuan Filature 1.357 3 Top-Grade White Silk 0.712 8</p>
<p>Top-Grade Gray Filature 703 9</p>
<h3>Sichuan Silk's Transportation to Shanghai is Not Smooth</h3>
<p>After the new silk went on the market in previous years, a large amount of new silk was usually shipped from Sichuan to Shanghai in August and September. This year, due to heavy taxes levied at the place of origin, the source is not smooth. In the middle of last month, the total amount of Sichuan silk transported by riverboats from Hankou to Shanghai was only over 700 bales.</p>
<p>Over Fifty Boxes of Broadcloth and Woolens Opened</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the Broadcloth and Woolens Association opened a total of over fifty boxes of wool fabrics. Sixty percent of them were delivered on the same day with warehouse receipts. Customer groups on this street accounted for half of the share. Among them, checked, solid-color, and variegated Walter tweed accounted for the majority, followed by variegated serge and fancy fabrics. Overcoats and robes were extremely rare, as customer groups had already prepared thick overcoats and robes. Therefore, only Shanghai has demand for domestic camel hair. A total of over a hundred pieces were opened in the north and south markets. The Weilin Tiger Return and Tianxiang Crane brand factories accounted for the majority, and miscellaneous second-grade goods priced at 1 liang 2-3 qian also saw significant transactions. Most of the buyers were opening for advertising sales. The storefront list prices were only 3 jiao 8 fen and 4 jiao 2 fen per foot.</p>
<p>Hardware: New Lead Wire Spot Market is Thin</p>
<p>The new lead wire sales market has been very strong recently due to the relationship of the lack of goods, so the opening is quite impressive, but the arrival of goods is surprisingly small, so the market has a situation of supply falling short of demand. The current market price for rough 12-gauge is 10 taels per dan, 13-gauge is 9 taels 7 qian 5 fen, 14-gauge is 10 taels 0 qian 5 fen, 15-gauge is 10 taels 0 qian 6 fen 5 li, 16-gauge to 20-gauge is priced at 13 taels 2 qian 5 fen, and the single-strand price ranges from 11 taels 5 qian to 14 taels 5 qian. 21-gauge to 25-gauge is priced at 17 taels 5 qian per dan, which is 5 qian cheaper than before, but the actual transactions are mostly selected colors, and the overall sales are very limited.</p>

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Visits Wang and Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Revisits Sun Ke Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Wang's Illness Aggravated by Liver Disease, Will Not Come Down the Mountain Recently</p>
<p>Huang Will Stay in Shanghai for Two or Three Days Before Returning to Beijing</p>
<p>Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong, summoned by telegram from Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Committee, went to Lushan to meet and receive orders to go to Mogan Mountain to meet Wang Huiwen. Huang arrived in Shanghai by long-distance bus from Zhafule the night before. At about 11:00 AM yesterday, he went to Columbia Road to visit and talk with Zhongwei Sun Ke for about an hour. It is heard that Huang was conveying greetings from Jiang to Sun and advising Sun to go to Beijing as soon as possible. According to Huang to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, I met Mr. Wang in Mogan Mountain, and learned that Mr. Wang's illness had been aggravated by the addition of liver disease, so it was more severe than before. German doctor Noel rushed to examine and treat him. I did not have time to meet with him, so I could not know the situation in the past few days. This trip is to comfort Mr. Wang and report on the situation in Guangxi. Jiang did not indicate whether he would return to Beijing before Double Ten Festival. I met Sun this morning (that is, yesterday morning) and talked about general issues, but did not talk about the succession of the Premier. Mr. Wang cannot come to Beijing recently and must wait until the illness has slightly improved before he can go. I will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days before returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Taikoo Company</p>
<h3>Zhoushan Steamer Runs Aground</h3>
<p>Passengers All Rescued</p>
<p>The Zhoushan steamer of the British-owned Taikoo Company, coming from the Beiyang area, ran aground near Yantai, and the ship's hull was damaged. News received in Shanghai is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Specially Sailing Northeast, Exclusively Going to Northeast Andong Route, Taikoo's Zhoushan vessel, when it last departed, was one day before our country announced the blockade of Northeast customs, so it carried many goods. When the ship arrived in Andong, the puppet state, because it was after September 25th, levied ship taxes and import duties on it. It can be said that it was the first steamer from Shanghai to Andong after the puppet state announced the collection of taxes. This time, it carried soybeans, miscellaneous grains, passengers, etc. from Andong to Shanghai. While passing through Yantai, it went off course, causing the accident.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Running Aground On the first day of this month, at midnight, the steamer arrived in the waters off Yantai, about one nautical mile east of Yantai, in a place called Waitou Island. Affected by the fog and dew on the sea, it went off course and entered a hidden reef. The captain noticed something was wrong and wanted to retreat, but the front of the ship had already entered the reef. The steel plates on both sides of the bow cabin and the outer hull were also broken by the reef. In an instant, water began to pour in.</p>
<p>Damage Situation The place where it ran aground was at the lower end of the bow. The bottom of the hull was also broken by sharp reefs, and seawater rushed in. Fortunately, the middle cabin and the engine room were isolated from each other, and were not affected. However, the bow cabin was flooded, quickly reaching eight or nine feet, and the goods were completely submerged. If it weren't for the reef holding it up, the front of the ship would have sunk into the sea long ago.</p>
<p>Captain Seeks Help When the accident occurred, Captain Evans was unable to get the ship out of danger, so he urgently sent an SOS distress signal by radio. The first to receive the warning were two British warships anchored near Liugong Island, which immediately sailed to rescue. At the same time, they telegraphed the Yantai and Shanghai Taikoo head offices. Before long, a British naval tugboat and small steamer also arrived, and immediately cooperated in the rescue work, deciding to first transfer the passengers from the ship.</p>
<p>Passengers Rescued When the British naval vessel arrived near Waitou Island, it sent a small steamer to the side of the Zhoushan ship. The passengers were evacuated batch by batch to the naval tugboat. At that time, the passengers had gathered on the deck, panicking and seeking help. They were rescued from danger by the British naval small steamer. Working late into the night, all the crew and passengers were safely transported to Yantai without injury. Captain Evans was said to still be on the ship, and the navy had sent a tugboat to dock alongside the Zhoushan, and dispatched soldiers to assist in the protection.</p>
<p>Wusong Receives Telegram Yesterday at 2:50, the Wusong Radio Station received an emergency telegram from the Zhoushan steamer, reporting that the ship had run aground on a small island outside Weihaiwei, the situation was dangerous, and requesting nearby ships to come to the rescue immediately.</p>
<p>Preparing for Towing The Shanghai head office received the news that the Xinshengjing steamer had previously run aground outside Yantai, and telegraphed the Dalian Japanese Salvage Company to tow it out of danger. Now it is still following the previous method, and has telegraphed the Dalian Salvage Company to quickly dispatch a tugboat and bring technicians and workers to tow it. It is expected to arrive there at noon today. The naval authorities have also sent divers into the sea to first repair the broken holes under the bow of the ship, and then find a way to tow it. It is reported that the Zhoushan steamer has a displacement of over 2,500 tons, and the customs registration is 1,338 tons. This time, it came to Shanghai from Andong, and the goods were mostly soybeans and miscellaneous grains.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Yesterday</p>
<h3>Welcomes Siamese Overseas Chinese Representative Chen Wulie</h3>
<p>Over 130 Celebrated Figures from All Walks of Life Attended</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Ding Chao-wu Delivered a Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation held a reception at the West Hall on the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to welcome Siamese overseas Chinese Chen Wulie, and invited celebrated figures from all walks of life, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Welcome Situation Those present yesterday included Central Committee members Ding Chao-wu, Chen Jia-you, Xiong Ke-wu, Bai Wen-wei, Zhang Zhi-jiang, as well as Ma Kui, Cheng Qian, Xu Qian, Li Denghui, Wang Huaqiang, Wu Kaisheng, Cai Guoyingluan, Liu Shimu, Qiu Luanxie, Zou Zuohua, Huang Jianzhong, overseas Chinese Chen Wulie, Bai Hongji, standing committee member of the Overseas Chinese Federation Xu Jigong, and over 130 male and female guests. At 3:00 PM sharp, music was played as they entered the hall. Xu Jigong presided, Yao Zhenlong recorded, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, Ding Chao-wu delivered a welcome speech (speech recorded separately), Representative Chen delivered a reply speech (speech recorded separately), Bai Hongqi (Annan overseas Chinese), Bai Wenwei, Xu Qian, Zhang Zhijiang, Huang Jianzhong, Wu Kaisheng, etc. delivered speeches successively, and finally Xu Jigong delivered a general thank you speech, and then music was played to end the meeting, which was after 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Ding's Speech Today, the Overseas Chinese Federation,</p>
<p>is here to welcome Mr. Chen Wulie, a giant in the overseas Chinese community, and all of you. I am very happy and honored to have the opportunity to participate and deliver a welcome speech on behalf of everyone. Why do we welcome Mr. Chen? There are three reasons: (1) Mr. Chen is one of the most successful overseas Chinese. Many of us Chinese go abroad, and naturally many fail. Mr. Chen is from Fujian, has been overseas for a long time, and has businesses in Siam and Singapore, which are very developed, especially in Siam. Because of his great contributions to the Siamese government and people, he was awarded the title of Marquis, which is not easy. "Returning home in glory" is an honorable and enviable thing, but Mr. Chen has made great achievements in overseas business and politics, and now he is returning from overseas, which is truly "returning home in glory." His honor is incomparable to those who are merely wealthy in the country. This is the first point that is worthy of our welcome. (2) He is a capitalist and a revolutionary. We know that there are many capitalists among the overseas Chinese, but because of the environment, many dare not express or support it openly. Mr. Chen, regardless of success or failure, regardless of profit or loss, resolutely participated in the revolutionary work for the sake of saving the declining motherland. Therefore, many of the party's pioneers have a close relationship with him, and the strength of the revolution has been strengthened and the speed of the revolution has been accelerated. This is the second point that is worthy of our welcome. (3) Mr. Chen continues to work hard to love the country. Now that the Chinese revolution is finally coming to an end, the suffering of the people in the country has not decreased, but seems to be increasing. Mr. Chen believes that the root cause of the political chaos in China is that the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized. To stabilize the people's livelihood, we must develop industry and increase production. China has mineral resources everywhere, but they have not been exploited. There is a surplus of labor, which cannot be utilized. The annual trade deficit has reached tens of millions of dollars. If goods are abandoned on the ground and the rights and interests are leaked, how can the country not be poor, weak, or chaotic? This time, Mr. Chen has returned to China to investigate domestic resources for development and to investigate domestic goods to find ways to sell them abroad. If we advance in this two-pronged approach, the people's livelihood will naturally improve and the national strength will also increase. Mr. Chen has this grand ambition and effort, which is the third point that is worthy of our welcome. I also went to Nanyang last year, and I have some personal feelings and opinions to share with you overseas Chinese for reference. If you adopt them, they may be of some help. (1) Overseas Chinese must unite. We feel that overseas Chinese are too scattered, so their strength cannot be concentrated. Because their strength cannot be concentrated, they are often despised and bullied. Why do we see them so scattered? The biggest problem is that they make trouble with provincial and even prefecture and county boundaries abroad, especially in Singapore, where there are provincial and county guild halls, just like in the country. They should know that there is a whole "Republic of China" and a whole "Chinese nation" overseas. Why make trouble with local boundaries abroad? Therefore, imperialists take advantage of this weakness to sow discord or try to strengthen our local concepts, making it even more difficult for us to unite and be slaughtered by them. I advocate that the Chinese Association should unify them. In addition, more clubs should be set up to replace the guild halls of various places. Membership is not limited to people from a certain province, so that feelings can be harmonious and the effect of unity can be achieved. Passively, we can eliminate foreign insults, and actively, we can advance our own careers and help the motherland. (2) We must eliminate conflicts among overseas Chinese. Why do we still have conflicts with each other when we are guests in a foreign country? It is strange to say that this is also because the Chinese have too strong feudal ideas and too deep factional relationships, which are intricate and complex. This attack and that rebuttal, conflicts are inevitable. Small ones become protracted lawsuits, mutually seeking victory in the words of the government of the place of residence (among the lawsuits of overseas Chinese of various countries in the Philippines, the Japanese have the least and the Chinese have the most). Large ones become mutual killings and evolve into tragedies (such as the gang fights of overseas Chinese in the United States). We have never seen people from country A in country B engage in the same kind of cannibalism like we Chinese do. It is really a shameful thing. I advocate that local party headquarters, consulates, chambers of commerce, and the Chinese Association should jointly form a public judicial body to strictly implement it. In this way, conflicts may be reduced. (3) Expand and improve education. We people in the country think that overseas Chinese are rich and their education must be good, but this is not entirely true. First, there is a lack of talent; second, there is a lack of funds; third, there is no unified guidance organization (especially in the British colonies, where a unified education association cannot be organized). Because it is not well run, many overseas Chinese children are sent to foreign schools to receive colonial education. In this case, the future of the Chinese nation and the status of overseas Chinese are in great danger. When overseas Chinese are in various forces, local squires, Europe and the United States and Japan are under siege, the only key is naturally to promote culture and improve knowledge as a prerequisite, otherwise the superior will be eliminated by the inferior, and in the future, I am afraid that they will be eliminated. I advocate that we should set up a unified guiding agency, hire domestic education experts, and local prestigious people to fill it. The consul will be in charge of the overall situation, and those who donate money must not interfere with the school's administration. We should also set up more primary and secondary schools. After graduation, students should be sent back to the country to study at universities. It is easy to run primary and secondary schools, but it is difficult to run universities. If overseas Chinese are serious about running them, they can easily do it. Overseas Chinese children study in local middle schools and in domestic universities, so that they will not be isolated from the situation in their motherland, and they can lead everything when they go back. In this way, China will have a group of powerful citizens. If we want to unite overseas Chinese and eliminate conflicts among overseas Chinese, we must rely on the improvement and expansion of education. And this arduous task cannot be accomplished without someone with the courage, vision, credibility in society, and status in politics like Mr. Chen, who comes forward to organize, promote, and correct. This is what I hope from Mr. Chen and all overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Photo of the Overseas Chinese Federation Welcoming Mr. Chen Wulie</p>
<p>Chen's Reply Today, I am very grateful to the comrades of the Overseas Chinese Federation for holding a welcome meeting to welcome me. However, I really dare not take the word "welcome." But in this venue, I have the opportunity to gather with you all, which is really a great honor. What Chairman Xu said just now is really too complimentary, which makes me feel very ashamed. Although I am an overseas Chinese growing up abroad, I have never dared to lag behind in my heart for the motherland. Therefore, over the years, I have only done my duty to the revolutionary cause, just to be worthy of my heart. I have always considered it the responsibility of a member of the nation, and I never talk about the word "contribution." In the first year of the Republic of China, I also returned to the motherland once. At that time, the late premier instructed me to follow him to Beiping. Unfortunately, I had important matters in Shanghai, so I did not follow the late premier, which I still regret to this day. I thought that after not returning to the motherland for 20 years, I should receive a better impression. Unexpectedly, the facts and thoughts were completely different. China over the years is still so corrupt, which cannot but make me feel infinite emotion. Although I received a lot of stimulation during this return to China, from another point of view, the national spirit in the country is indeed flourishing, and most of the current ruling gentlemen have old relationships with me. Their morality, learning, and the spirit of doing things in the past are all admired by me. When the country is in difficult times, they must work hard to cooperate, but the authorities also have international environmental relations from time to time, and they are often unable to fully develop their plans, so many things cannot be fulfilled as desired, so the effect of progress is slightly slow, so I hope that the unity of our nation cannot be relaxed at all. We should always learn from the late premier's fearless spirit and strive for the bright path. Every move should also be resolute and calm, so as to serve as a backing for our diplomacy. If the people and the government cooperate in unison to overcome the national crisis, our country will surely win the final victory. If we can do this, even if my temples are gray, I am willing to sacrifice everything to follow the comrades in my country, which I dare not refuse. I think you all have the same intention. My Mandarin is not pure, that's about it. The last sentence is that the newspaper reported a few days ago that there are 6 million overseas Chinese in Siam, but I introduced them. You must know that the overseas Chinese in Siam have a long history, and it is impossible for me to introduce them alone. Also, this time's Siamese revolution, saying that I participated in it, is probably a misunderstanding. You must know that this Siamese revolution has special characteristics, so it was calmed down in three or four days. Although I have the Order of that country, in reality, I am just standing in the position of an overseas Chinese, and I will never participate in the political work of that country. These few words are my incidental statement. Thank you to the comrades from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Huang Bingheng Flew to Lushan Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>To Visit Chairman Chiang and Discuss Important Matters</p>
<p>After resigning from his post as Director of the Aviation Department, Huang Bingheng came to Shanghai, originally planning to expand everything and go abroad to inspect the aviation industry. However, due to the hot weather, he waited until the autumn cool to go abroad. Mr. Huang had previously made a trip to Hong Kong for private matters, and then returned to Shanghai. The night before, he received an order from Chairman Chiang in Lushan, ordering him to go to Lushan immediately to discuss important matters. He flew to Lushan yesterday morning at 7:00 AM to visit Chiang. It is said that it was about the issues of going abroad for inspection and suppressing bandits with the air force. He is expected to return to Shanghai in about three or four days.</p>
<p>International Problems Research Association</p>
<h3>Representatives Yu and Liang Go to Geneva</h3>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly will discuss the Sino-Japanese issue in mid-November. Yu Rizhang and Liang Shichun, representatives of our country's International Problems Research Association, set off the day before yesterday for Geneva on a special trip.

<h3>Hall Commissioners Inspect and Accept Baoshan Seawall Project</h3>
<p>The Baoshan section of the Jiangnan Seawall project has lasted for three months and cost more than 260,000 taels of silver. It was completed on the 15th of last month. On the second of the following month (last month), Shi, a commissioner of the Jiangnan Seawall Rehabilitation Committee, went to inspect and accept it. On the 25th (last month), he invited people from all walks of life to visit. The details were recorded in various newspapers. Zhang Junsheng, a commissioner of the Jiangsu Construction Department, together with Zhu Kaichou, a colleague of the Jiangnan Rehabilitation Committee Shi, went to Baoshan to inspect and accept the project the day before yesterday. The division chief Wan Kaijia, engineer Zhuang Jun, and section chiefs Wan Kaimao, Tang Huai, Zhu Demao, etc. explained each section in detail. Zhang Junsheng, a commissioner of the Hall, in addition to inspecting and comparing the military rehabilitation project, the rehabilitation project, and the emergency repair project section by section according to the scale on the map, also excavated deep pools in many places to inspect whether the stone layers and wooden piles were short or missing. In total, the inspection lasted for two days and ended yesterday at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Volunteer Army</p>
<h3>Support Association Cautiously Spends Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association believes that the support donations it has raised are the hard-earned money of patriotic compatriots. Therefore, it is very serious about the expenditure. All the expenses required for its own association affairs are also raised by the members themselves through other means, and no donations have been used at all. The two official letters of the association regarding the cautious expenditure are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Yan Baohang The association yesterday sent a letter to Yan Baohang, representative of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating, "We are writing to inform you that Xie Jun came to the meeting with a letter stating that he was a major general counselor of the 48th Route Army of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, and was sent by Commander Zheng Guilin to come south to request assistance. After investigation, his letter was not an official letter from the 48th Route Army, nor did it have the seal of Zheng Guilin, and Xie Jun even said at the time that he did not bring travel expenses, and hoped to be provided with relief immediately. We stated that our association has no precedent for providing individual relief, and politely declined. Later, we received a letter from Xie Jun, which contained many complaints. The case was resolved by the standing council meeting and forwarded to you for verification. Furthermore, we have recently received successive requests from representatives claiming to be from the Fourth Route and the 26th Route Army, but they did not have official documents and we could not distinguish the truth. According to the fact that these routes are under your association's overall jurisdiction, you should be able to understand the actual situation. You should make an overall plan to provide assistance, so as to avoid the trouble of sending representatives to the south from afar. We are sending this letter to you, and attaching Xie Jun's original letter. We hope that you will investigate and handle it." Reply to Yang Yijie, etc. The association yesterday replied to Yang Yijie, representative of the Fourth Route, and Liu Zongyao, representative of the 26th Route, stating, "We are writing to reply to your three letters of September 23, 24, and 28, which we have all read. We are grateful for your indication that your troops have been fighting hard against the Japanese and are in need of assistance, and that you have been ordered to come to Shanghai to request assistance. According to the fact that your routes have a unified affiliation, our association's handling of assistance matters has been resolved by the third general meeting of members, and the highest direct jurisdiction headquarters or a directly related anti-Japanese organization must be responsible for the petition. Regarding the request for assistance, we ask that your representatives inform your route commander to contact the original jurisdictional agency."</p>

<h3>Liaoning and Jilin Postal Savings</h3>
<p>Not Allowed to Be Transferred or Withdrawn</p>
<p>After the Restoration of Northeast Territory</p>
<p>The Interests of Depositors Can Still Be Recognized</p>
<p>Since the postal blockade of the Eastern Provinces, the Ministry of Communications has formulated measures to suspend the handling of postal services in the Liaoning and Jilin postal areas. It is reported that the payment of fixed deposits due to depositors in the Liaoning and Jilin postal remittance offices has also been suspended. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency stationed in Beijing visited the postal authorities yesterday. According to reports, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has been ordered to not approve the transfer of deposits and withdrawal of fixed deposits for depositors in Liaoning and Jilin, so as to prevent the outflow of state funds. After the restoration of the Northeast territory, the interests of depositors can still be recognized.</p>
<h3>Qing Civil Affairs Department Sends Representatives to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Investigating Relief and Education Initiatives</p>
<p>Wang Yutang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Qinghai Provincial Government, recognizing that the province is located in a remote frontier region with obstructed transportation and afflicted by successive years of drought and famine, resulting in the impoverishment of the populace and the common sight of homeless and destitute people sleeping on the streets, suffering from cold and hunger, deemed it deeply deplorable. Therefore, he, in accordance with the promulgated relief regulations, intends to establish large-scale relief organizations in the provincial capital and various counties to accommodate the suffering and impoverished people. However, lacking the resources for learning from examples, progress is difficult to achieve. Consequently, he appointed Shi Dianfeng as a special commissioner for domestic relief investigation to travel to various regions, including Peiping, Tianjin, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, to study social relief facilities. The investigator has now completed inspections in Peiping, Tianjin, the capital (Nanjing), Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou. On the 29th of last month, they arrived in Shanghai via the Jing-Hang (Beijing-Hangzhou) train and are residing in a certain commercial hotel on Rue de la Republique (Min Guo Lu) in the French Concession. It is reported that they will first make contact with the municipal government within days and then proceed to visit various relief organizations. Furthermore, the investigator considers social education and health facilities to be fundamental relief methods and deems it necessary to pay attention to them in conjunction. Therefore, in addition to visiting relief organizations, they also inspected educational and health facilities in various locations. They are expected to stay in Shanghai for approximately ten days before traveling to Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) and other regions before returning to Peiping and their hometown.</p>
<h3>China</h3>
<p>The National Products Organizations Federation's Overture</p>
<p>Yesterday's Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>The Chaozhou-Meizhou National Products Industry and Commerce Federation, to concentrate the strength of national national products organizations nationwide and expand the new life of the national products movement, plans to organize a national federation. It dispatched Chairman Ou Huaqi to Shanghai to make preparations and, in advance, went to Nanjing to meet with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry to seek advice. Minister Chen greatly approved of the plan, advocating that the federation be established in Shanghai, the center of national products, to facilitate planning and urging its early establishment to develop the national products industry's strength to save the country. Mr. Ou returned to Shanghai and sent letters to representatives of national products organizations in Beijing, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, inviting them to gather in Shanghai to discuss and exchange ideas. Yesterday, at 3:00 PM, a discussion meeting was held at the National Products Maintenance Association. Those in attendance were Ou Huaqi of the Chaozhou-Meizhou National Products Industry and Commerce Federation, Ma Xishen of the Shanghai National Products Factories Federation, Yu Renqian of the Hangzhou National Products Factories Federation, Wang Hanqiang and Wang Jie'an of the Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, Chen Yiting and Hu Xiyuan of the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, Wang Zhaochang of the Suzhou National Products Relief Association, He Pengcheng and Zu Panshi of the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factories Federation, and Shen Shuyu of the National Products Promotion League Committee. Wang Jie'an was elected chairman, and Huang Tuofo recorded the proceedings. The chairman first reported on the significance of convening the discussion meeting, and Ou Huaqi reported on the motives for organizing the national federation. Then, Chen Yiting, Hu Xiyuan, Yu Renqian, Shen Buyu, Wang Hanqiang, Wang Zhaochang, and others successively expressed their opinions, unanimously advocating active preparation and promoting early establishment. The chairman then summarized the opinions of the attendees, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) The provisional name will be the Chinese National Products Organizations Federation; (2) The organizational structure will be based on organizations as units; (3) Organizations from Beijing, Shantou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai will serve as preparatory members (other organizations from other places are welcome to join); (4) The preparatory office will be temporarily located within the Chinese National Products Maintenance Association; (5) Ou Huaqi, Wang Jie'an, and Shen Shuyu were elected to draft the organizational outline; (6) The first preparatory meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the fourth day, with the Maintenance Association designated as the convener; (7) The National Products Maintenance Association will initially provide the necessary funds for the preparatory period; (8) The situation of today's discussion meeting will be reported to national organizations for their reference and to gather opinions. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Building a Memorial Tower for Scout Martyrs</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Inscribes "Sacrificed for the Nation"</p>
<p>During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the 50th Scout Troop of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce participated in the 19th Route Army's rescue team, assisting in the care of wounded soldiers and refugees, making significant contributions. Unfortunately, four troop members, Bao Zhenwu, Mao Zhengxiang, Luo Yunxiang, and Ying Wenda, all young shop clerks, were suddenly abducted by Japanese soldiers and tragically sacrificed. Their remains have not been found to this day. The Chamber deeply mourns them and, as a result, passed a resolution at the current citywide representatives' meeting to build a memorial tower to honor the fallen. The tower has already begun construction at the entrance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday. The design is quite magnificent, with materials consisting of cement and steel reinforcement, surrounded by iron chains at the base. The tower monument is over two zhang (approximately 20 feet) high. On top are the four characters "Sacrificed for the Nation," inscribed by General Cai Tingkai. Below is a bronze plaque engraved with the details of the four martyrs' sacrifice. The project is expected to take one month, with an estimated cost of 2,000 silver dollars. Upon completion, a grand ceremony will be held.</p>
<h3>Road Extension Dispute</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Present Conditions to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Fei Xindun Has Yet to Comment</p>
<p>A Shanghai-based news agency reports that regarding the issue of recovering road extensions beyond the settlement, since the return to Shanghai of Fei Xindun, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, and his subsequent consultation with Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, both sides have expressed agreement on the principles of the draft agreement, and the date of resolution should not be far off. However, the opposition from the Japanese residents in Shanghai remains intense. They have held meetings at the Japanese Businessmen's Club office for several consecutive days to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they drafted several conditions and submitted them to the Japanese director of the Municipal Council, Si Bingyi, who then forwarded them to Fei Xindun for negotiation. They will also make a formal representation to the Municipal Council within days.</p>
<p>Conditions Outlined The most important of the conditions proposed by the Japanese residents regarding the Municipal Council's abandonment of roads beyond the settlement is that, at a minimum, the Japanese side should retain the right to freely station police after the roads beyond the settlement are taken back by the Chinese government. Other conditions, such as Japanese residents in the area beyond the settlement never paying heavy taxes and Japanese residents being free to build within the roads beyond the settlement without interference from the Chinese government, are also secondary. The full text is not limited to these few items. However, according to the Japanese residents' opinion, if the Municipal Council can accept the above three conditions, then the other items can be discussed at length or even abandoned altogether. This is because if the above conditions can be implemented, then even if the road extensions beyond the settlement are recovered by our side, there will be no loss to the Japanese's additional interests, and the road extensions beyond the settlement would simply be transformed into a Japanese concession.</p>
<p>Petition Process After deciding to propose conditions to the Municipal Council regarding the abandonment of roads beyond the settlement, the Japanese residents in Shanghai immediately appointed Yasui, the Chairman of the Administrative Committee of the Residents' Association, and two others as representatives to submit a petition and the proposed conditions to Si Bingyi, the Japanese director of the Municipal Council. Si Bingyi immediately agreed to submit the conditions to Fei Xindun, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, and requested him to consider and accommodate them. He also instructed the representatives to wait for a reply at the Residents' Association office.</p>
<p>Negotiation with Fei Xindun Si Bingyi, the Japanese director of the Municipal Council, after receiving the Japanese residents' petition and conditions, visited Fei Xindun, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, on the afternoon of the 30th to request that Fei Xindun give the conditions proposed by the Japanese residents as much consideration and accommodation as possible. However, Fei Xindun only explained the contents of the draft agreement on the recovery of roads beyond the settlement to Si Bingyi that day and did not make any statement regarding the conditions proposed by the Japanese residents. The two sides met until approximately 3:00 PM, but no results were achieved. Si Bingyi then left and returned to the Residents' Association office to report the negotiation with Fei Xindun to the Japanese residents.</p>
<p>Another Meeting Called Yasui, the Chairman of the Administrative Committee of the Japanese Residents' Association, after receiving Si Bingyi's report, immediately notified the Japanese residents that another meeting would be held at the Residents' Association office at 5:00 PM on the 8th of this month (Saturday) to discuss further measures. Yasui has already begun drafting measures to formally present to the Municipal Council, preparing to submit them to the meeting on the 8th for detailed discussion before being submitted to Fei Xindun, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, by Si Bingyi.</p>
<h3>Completion of New Building for Public Hospital</h3>
<p>Resuming Medical Services</p>
<p>The Chinese Public Hospital on Tongji Road in Zhabei was founded in the second year before the founding of the Republic of China (1910). At that time, a quarantine storm arose in Shanghai, causing public sentiment to surge and a crisis to be imminent. After several negotiations with the Municipal Council of the concession, the right to treat epidemics by Chinese people was finally won. Since its opening, it has been 23 years. Each year, it has cured a large number of infectious diseases, such as smallpox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and meningitis. As the number of patients seeking medical treatment increased daily, it was decided last year to add more wards to expand relief. During the January 28th Incident, the hospital buildings were completely destroyed. Fortunately, the wards that had not yet been completed were not affected. Now, in view of the severe epidemic after the war and the lack of places for relief, workers and materials were gathered to continue construction and complete the project. The completion ceremony of the new building was held yesterday, resuming medical services. Those who attended included Chen Bingqian, Lu Bohong, Ha Shaofu, Gansu Chu, Wang Binyan, Xu Chunrong, and over one hundred representatives from various fire brigades, organizations, and the Municipal Council Hospital. The event was quite grand for a time. Chen Weihan, the director of the hospital, and others provided cordial receptions and guided tours of the various facilities, which were all greatly appreciated. Upon seeing the destroyed wards and the broken walls and ruins, they frequently lamented their pity. However, due to financial constraints, there are no funds for repairs. It is deeply hoped that philanthropists at sea will generously donate funds to support this good cause so that it may last for a long time.</p>
<h3>South Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Public Bus Company's Submission</p>
<p>Regarding the Resolution of Labor Disputes</p>
<p>The South Shanghai Public Bus Co., Ltd. submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the company had already declared bankruptcy and was undergoing liquidation. On the one hand, it planned to add share capital and reorganize to restore business, and separate reports had been submitted to your bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau for record. It was found that the company has a total of more than one hundred and sixty employees, and most of them are well aware of the company's difficult situation. At this time of economic hardship, it is impossible to increase capital and reorganize to restore business unless previous disputes are completely resolved. The company immediately followed the accountant Jiang's announcement, returned the copper badges and uniforms, and signed for wages as dismissed employees, with as many as ninety people. Unexpectedly, a group of people including Qian Yuangao, Qiao Jihe, and Wang Agui, who had previously advanced funds from the company, would inevitably have their wages deducted this time, which was detrimental to them. They incited various workers to resolutely oppose it, with the aim of expanding the labor unrest. Initially, they gathered inside the factory and imprisoned the directors Zhang Lunting, business director Jiang Jizhe, and car service director Xia Shuxiang for a day, not allowing them to move freely. Later, the representatives Peng Zhenqiu from your bureau and Fan Guoren from the municipal party department, together with accountant Jiang, mediated and released them. They then advocated not handing over the copper badges and uniforms and refusing to deduct the borrowed funds. Also, representatives Peng from your bureau and Fan from the municipal party department, at accountant Jiang's office, drafted a document stating that workers should retain their uniforms but not wear them, which stated that all workers of the South Shanghai Public Bus Co., Ltd., due to the temporary suspension of business and declaration of liquidation of the company, had received seven tenths of their wages for March of this year and the second half of August of this year. All workers' copper badges and uniforms, except for those who voluntarily returned them to the company at their discretion, were to be kept by the workers themselves. Before the company resumes business, they will never be worn, and if the company cannot resume business, they will be handed over in accordance with the orders of the Party (government) authorities. If there is any private wearing, they will be severely punished. The document included the signatures and positions of the workers, as well as the signatures and positions of the Party and government representatives and the accountant, as proof of dismissal. When the wages were being distributed, the representatives Peng and Fan instructed each worker who did not want to hand over their uniforms to sign their name individually. While the document was being signed, the document suddenly disappeared, with the intention of burying the evidence and leaving room for labor-management disputes. Representative Peng was very angry and announced in public that if it was not handed over, the Public Security Bureau would be asked to handle it strictly. The worker representative Qian Gugao stated to Representative Peng that he was willing to take responsibility and would definitely find it and hand it over. Representative Peng handed it over to the liquidator for safekeeping. Representative Peng instructed that wages should still be issued as usual, and instructed the company's audit director, Cheng Zemin, to pay an additional seventy yuan to the workers whose prepaid funds were fully deducted as a discretionary allowance for living expenses. This was the situation when the three parties handled it together that day. The workers have not handed over the document to this day, and instead dared to submit a mixed submission to your bureau, ordering the immediate resumption of business and other matters, which is not surprising. Whether the company can add capital and reorganize will be resolved after the liquidation is completed, which is another matter. Now, the workers are ignoring the facts and committing the crimes of theft and fraud. It should be requested that your bureau thoroughly investigate and handle the matter strictly, and at the same time order the return of the previous documents to the liquidator, accountant Jiang, for safekeeping, in order to show prudence. I am overwhelmed with public sentiment. Respectfully submitted to Wu Quyong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, September 12, the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Another submission stated, "Respectfully submitted, I was recently ordered to send representatives to your bureau for questioning. The shareholders' meeting of the South Shanghai Public Bus Co., Ltd. has resolved to appoint liquidator Jiang Wanping as the accountant to liquidate the company. Whether it can resume business must be determined after the liquidator has completed the liquidation. Therefore, employees are first dismissed in accordance with the law in order to avoid disputes. Most of the workers have complied. However, a small number of people, including Qian Shungao, have created complications and are difficult to acknowledge. Everything was reported in detail on September 12. Please ask your bureau to uphold justice. The South Shanghai Public Bus Company is a limited liability company and is in the process of liquidation. Although Yongzhong was a director, he cannot represent any responsibility. Respectfully submitted to Wu Quyong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, September 26, the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Another submission stated, "Regarding the dismissal of company employees, the Bureau of Social Affairs assigned committee member Peng and the Municipal Party Department assigned committee member Fan, who together with the employees signed a document on September 3, which was published that day. Everything was reported to your bureau on September 12 for review and processing. Now, a small number of people, including Qian Shungao, Zhou Anshan, Hu Jinshan, Xia Xianyi, Shang Liansheng, Pan Songyuan, Ni Rubao, and Peng Ayi, without any reason, suddenly entered the company on September 28, drove out the manager, and occupied the factory premises, causing the liquidator to be unable to perform his duties. This constitutes the crime of criminal trespassing on private property and obstructing official duties. These employees signed a document when they received their money, stipulating that those who had not returned their copper badges and uniforms to the company would not wear them before the company resumed business, or that when the company could not resume business, they should be submitted in accordance with the orders of the Party and government authorities. If there is any private wearing, they would be severely punished. The uniforms cannot be worn before the company resumes business, or when the company cannot resume business. These employees naturally cannot have any disputes with the company, and there is no room for mediation. Now, Qian Shungao and others, in broad daylight, when private property cannot be communized by anyone, blatantly disregard the law, facts, and reason, and carry out communist acts. This is intolerable. It should be requested that your bureau immediately uphold justice in accordance with the law and send Qian Shungao and others to the court for legal action to maintain order. The company is fortunate, and the locality is fortunate. Respectfully submitted to Wu Quyong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, October 2, the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Jardine Matheson Yangtze River Fleet</h3>
<p>Streamlining Operations and Reducing Workers</p>
<p>Arousing Opposition from All Workers</p>
<p>The Union Issues a Serious Protest</p>
<p>After the British Jardine Matheson Shipping Company stipulated the standard number of workers in the middle-class cabins, it was bound to reduce workers. As a result, all workers opposed it. The Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Union has issued a serious protest to the company. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Stipulating Standards In order to streamline the Yangtze River fleet and maintain the company's reputation, the Jardine Matheson Company believes that eliminating the tea house is an urgent matter. Specific measures were stipulated, and the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association was notified to abide by them. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) The number of tea house workers on each ship must not exceed the following standards: Anqing 30, Wusong 40, Wuchang 40, Huangpu 40, Datong 30, Poyang 30, Wuxue 20, Wuhu 20, Changsha 25. (2) Each tea house worker must have two two-inch photos, with their name, age, and address written on the back for verification. (3) Each tea house worker must wear a steel badge with their number and ship name marked on it for identification. The badge should be purchased by the comprador. (4) Tea house workers must wear uniforms while on the ship to maintain neatness. The uniforms should be purchased by the comprador. (5) If a tea house worker leaves the job and is replaced by another person, the company's consent must be obtained first. Any tea house worker exceeding the above number or not complying with the above regulations will be regarded by the company as a passenger, and the comprador will be responsible for their travel expenses.</p>
<p>Serious Protest After learning of this, all the middle-class cabin workers were panicked and immediately united to express their opposition. At the same time, they reported to the Jianghai Vessels Middle Cabin Public Office for assistance. Zhou Xiaoting, the standing committee member of the Public Office, in addition to investigating the details, immediately reported to the Seamen's Union standing members He Zhen, Cheng Yeyi, etc. After the meeting, considering the livelihood of workers during this time of national crisis, which is already extremely painful, if workers are further reduced and lose their jobs, wouldn't it greatly affect the national livelihood? Moreover, the workers on each ship have a considerable work history and have never acted improperly. Assisting the shipping industry has never hindered the company's reputation. In addition to notifying the workers on each ship to work with peace of mind, Secretary Gao will be sent to the company to issue a serious protest. They will not give up until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Silk Factory Strike</h3>
<p>Yichang Factory Suddenly Announces Closure</p>
<p>The Situation of Disputes is Becoming Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>After the strike of female workers in various silk factories in Hongkou, although the Social Affairs Bureau has mediated twice, the labor-management sides have remained firm in their attitudes, so it has not been resolved. Yesterday, the Silk Weaving Industry Union of the Fourth District specially convened female foremen (i.e., foremen) from various factories to hold a discussion meeting. Yichang Silk Factory implemented a closure. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion Meeting For the sake of resolving the labor unrest, the Silk Weaving Industry Union of the Fourth District convened a discussion meeting of female foremen from various factories at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the union's headquarters at No. 17 Tian Tong Road, Shouyinfang. More than 40 female foremen from various factories and all the union's directors attended. The union's standing director, Le Xiaorong, reported on the two mediation sessions of the Bureau of Social Affairs. Then, the female foremen from various factories reported on the attitudes of the striking female workers. If the factory side does not agree to increase wages, it is feared that the goal of resuming work cannot be achieved for a while. However, after discussing for two hours, there were still no significant results.</p>
<p>Yichang Closure Yichang Silk Factory at No. 2 Wuzhou Road is the largest in scale and the crown of various silk factories in Hongkou. Factories such as Tongwei, Yujing, Houfu, and Yuyu are all factories that reel silk on behalf of Yichang and have a related relationship with the factory. Unexpectedly, the factory suddenly announced its closure yesterday. The original text of the factory's announcement is recorded below:</p>
<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>Monday (15)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Strives for Reputation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Turkish Bath Changes Signboard</p>
<p>A Turkish women's massage parlor on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai used the words "Overseas Chinese" on its signboard, calling itself the "Overseas Chinese Turkish Bath" to attract customers. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believed that it tarnished the reputation of overseas Chinese and sent a letter to the municipal government requesting that it be banned. The municipal government replied that it had sent personnel to investigate and immediately ordered the owner of the bathhouse to change the signboard. The owner of the bathhouse has already complied and removed the words "Overseas Chinese" from the signboard, changing the name to "Huaxin."</p>
<h3>Supplemental Record of the French Concession Police Department</h3>
<p>Grounds for Appeal in the Russian Beggar Case</p>
<p>Rejection by the Third Branch of the High Court</p>
<p>The case of Russian beggar Georgi Latyki Aev, who died of illness in June of this year in the detention center of the Second Special District Court, concluded after trial in the criminal division of the Second Special Court. The judgment found the warden of the detention center, Xu Chongwen, and Judge Yu Mingao, not guilty. The part of the charge against jailer Zhou Zongxiang for abandonment leading to death was dismissed. Subsequently, because the Police Department disagreed with the original judgment, it submitted a petition to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to file an appeal. The second instance court has already ruled to reject the appeal. These details have been recorded in previous reports. The following supplements the Police Department's grounds for appeal: The appellant is the French Concession Police Department, and the appellees are Zhou Zongxiang, Xu Chongwen, and Yu Mingao. This serves to supplement the grounds for appeal:</p>
<p>(1) Procedure: The original judgment, based on Article 258, Paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, stated that the Police Department's case referral form and its statement of the main points of the prosecution both recognized that Zhou Zongxiang had committed an act of assault leading to death, and prosecuted him under Article 296 of the Criminal Code. Only after the investigation of evidence was completed did the prosecution change to Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Regarding the part of the charge against Zhou Zongxiang for abandonment leading to death, it was dismissed. The Police Department believes that this dismissal can only be applied to prosecutions by prosecutors and is not suitable for courts prosecuting based on agreements by administrative authorities. This case, before the Police Department initiated prosecution, repeatedly requested the court to approve an autopsy. The court replied that, according to the agreement, the Police Department did not have this authority. Also, after the Police Department detains a suspect, they must be transferred to the court within 24 hours; if this time is exceeded, they should be released. A few hours of investigation are often insufficient to understand the facts. Even when transferring the case, first requesting detention for further investigation and then citing legal articles, the Police Department, because its authority is ultimately different from that of a prosecutor, inevitably made mistakes when stating the main points of the prosecution and citing articles of the Criminal Code. After detailed research, amending to appropriate legal articles is fair, and it is also a method frequently adopted by the court of first instance. As for the course of this case, the facts could not be fully understood without an autopsy, but without prosecution, the Police Department could not dissect the corpse. The prosecution of the appellees is not comparable to an ordinary request to detain them first. Therefore, Article 256, Paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be applied to this case, and the request is that the original judgment, regarding the dismissal of the part of the charge against Zhou Zongxiang for abandonment leading to death, should be overturned and a new disposition made.</p>
<p>(2) Facts: Even if the testimonies of the three Russians detained with the victim are deemed inadmissible, the testimonies of the appellees differ from each other and contradict themselves. Yu Mingao testified that on June 17, the deceased suffered from cholera and dysentery. Checking his diagnosis report, it also stated that on the 17th, the Russian prisoner was diagnosed with a seasonal epidemic, alternating chills and fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. This disease is extremely dangerous and easily leads to death. It is not a condition that can be treated inside a cell shared with other prisoners. The person in charge should have transferred him to an appropriate place and treated him according to whether the illness was cholera or dysentery. It could not be determined by simply taking his pulse from outside the cell, nor could it be cured with a bottle of emergency water. Xu Chongwen received a report from the jailer on June 17 and already knew the deceased's condition. He should have immediately ordered his transfer from the prison to receive appropriate treatment, instead of waiting until June 19, when the illness was already critical and beyond medical help, before thinking of this. According to the above reasons, their testimonies are still considered credible. Reviewing the records, the inadmissibility of their testimonies is listed as follows: All three Russians detained together testified that from the time the deceased was detained until his death, Yu Mingao never treated him once. The court of first instance considered his statement that drinking water was a fact, which proved that the deceased did indeed drink medicine, etc. Anyone detained, whether sick or not, naturally has water to drink in the detention center. How can it be considered that the water drunk must have been hot water containing medicine? The witnesses have no vested interest, and their testimonies are the same. The defendants' testimonies are different, and the testimony of the Russian interpreter, Cao Jianhou, is particularly different. It is simply not credible. Furthermore, Yu Mingao and Xu Chongwen both testified during the court hearing that the doctor had treated him four times, the first time at 5 p.m. on June 17, 11 a.m. on June 18, and 5 p.m. on the afternoon and morning of the 19th. However, Xu Chongwen, during questioning by French Concession Police Superintendent Faber on July 1 (whose testimony was signed by Xu Chongwen), stated that the doctor saw the deceased three times, the first time at 5 p.m. on the 18th. This statement of the first time on the 18th is definitely not a mistake in remembering the date; otherwise, he should have said four times instead of three. Yu Mingao stated to the Police Department, "I treated Gadarji at 11 a.m. on June 18 and did not stay long because the interpreter told me, 'His condition has improved,' and I saw that his condition was slightly better. The interpreter spoke to him, and he answered a few words." This is consistent with the interpreter Cao Jianhou's testimony during the court hearing on August 4: "I went into the detention center with the doctor at 5 p.m. on June 17. After Yu asked the Russian, he said he had a stomach ache. I did not go on the 18th. Whether the doctor went alone or not is not something I know." Yu Mingao testified during the court hearing on July 8, "At 11 a.m. on June 18, the jailer reported to me that the Russian's condition was better. I gave him Ping An powder." The above are excerpts from the court record. The records of officials dispatched by the administrative authority are even more detailed. "The next morning, I went for a follow-up examination. Because the patient was fast asleep, according to the jailer's report, the condition had slightly improved, so I gave the jailer a small amount of Ping An powder and ordered him to give it to him when he woke up." Zhou Zongxiang stated on July 8 that, "The condition was slightly lighter at 10 a.m. on the 18th, and I reported that he had taken a kind of powder medicine." It was not until the court hearing on August 4 that he stated, "He was examined once at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the 18th and took two kinds of medicine." Yu Mingao only stated, "I gave him Ping An powder." The medicine requisition slip presented to the court by Li Dianzhong, the director of medicine management, also only had one slip each for June 17 and 18. Examining the successive testimonies of the defendants and Cao Jianhou, Li Dianzhong, etc., at the Police Department and at the three court hearings, it is clear that each time the testimonies of the defendants and witnesses gradually converged, and even if the testimonies of the three Russians are interpreted, loopholes are still unavoidable, and attempts to cover them up are even more obvious. Yu Mingao initially tried to use the excuse that the time of treatment coincided with the time when other Russians were eating, but he did not know that prisoners in the detention center do not leave their place of detention when eating. Even if the time of treatment coincided with the time of eating, the three Russians would have seen it. Then, he tried to use the excuse that he did not understand Russian, and that the three Russians may not have known that he was a doctor. However, the Russian interpreter testified that he used Russian to question the deceased's illness, so how could the three Russians not know that he was a doctor? Yu Mingao and Zhou Zongxiang also used the excuse that when the doctor treated him, he stood outside the iron railing and only bent over and reached into the railing. This is tantamount to admitting abandonment because treating a patient definitely cannot be accomplished by simply taking a pulse or looking at him from across the railing. In summary, the testimonies of the three Russians are consistent, and the testimonies of the defendants and Cao Jianhou, Li Dianzhong, etc., are clearly the result of post-event consultation, and they cannot agree. They are not credible. As for the two medicine requisition slips presented by Li Dianzhong, they cannot be adopted as evidence. These loose slips of paper are not comparable to those registered in books and sequentially linked daily. Yu Zhou Li Cao are all staff members of the detention center and belong to the same organization. It is not difficult for Yu Mingao to make up and submit them to Li after the fact. Regarding the transfer to the hospital, Xu Chongwen and Yu Mingao's answers to the Police Department and Yu's diagnosis report all stated that sending him to the hospital required the court's permission, and it happened to be a weekend holiday, so it could not be processed. Later, life was entrusted to complicated procedures, which was inappropriate. Therefore, in the testimony on July 8, the wording was changed, stating that the doctor advocated sending him to the hospital, but the disease changed before it could be arranged. On August 4, Xu Chongwen stated that the patient was seriously ill and did not want to report to the court, so he ordered a car, etc. Each testimony is different. This is just an explanation based on the circumstances in the hope of avoiding responsibility. In fact, according to Yu Mingao's testimony, the deceased's illness was already serious on June 17, and he should have been transferred to the hospital immediately, instead of waiting until he was dying before deciding.</p>
<p>The Police Department is convinced by the original judgment regarding the part of the charge against Zhou Zongxiang for assault leading to death. Regarding the part of the charge against him for abandonment leading to death, the Police Department believes that the original judgment of dismissal is inappropriate and should be revoked and a new judgment made. Revoking the original judgment against Xu Chongwen and Yu Mingao for abandonment leading to death and punishing them with the appropriate crime would be morally right. Respectfully presented to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>

<h3>Water Cut Off at Old Tianxiang Lane</h3>
<p>Tenants Have Filed Lawsuit with the Court</p>
<p>The Zhongfa Real Estate Trust Company, the owner of Old Tianxiang Lane on Beile Road, sent people to build fences the other day in preparation for demolishing the houses.

<h3>Bausan South Gate</h3>
<p>Bizarre Assassination Case</p>
<p>A Woman Lived Alone</p>
<p>Three Knife Wounds to the Head Fatal</p>
<p>Clothes and Belongings All Intact</p>
<p>A Dong woman outside the Baoshan South Gate drawbridge was suddenly broken into her home around midnight the other night. The intruder broke into her bedroom and slashed her with a sharp blade. The woman woke up screaming for help. The nearby police officers on duty heard the alarm and went to investigate. They found the woman lying on the ground, her head and face covered in blood, and the murderer had disappeared without a trace. They immediately flew back to report to the bureau. Director Gao, after hearing the report, immediately went to the scene of the incident to investigate. The woman died due to her serious injuries. Director Gao, believing that the matter concerned a capital case, reported it to the county government. Yesterday morning, Judge He and clerk Yao, etc., went to the scene of the incident to examine the corpse. It was found that the wounds on the deceased's head were indeed fatal, caused by being slashed before death. Subsequently, the deceased's nephew, Dong Guorong, turned himself in, claiming that the deceased had always lived alone. After the incident, nothing inside the house was moved, and no clothing, etc., was missing from the room. After Judge He verified the confession, it was impossible to guess whether the woman was killed by bandits or murdered by an enemy. He filled out the coroner's report, ordered that a coffin be prepared for burial, and strictly ordered the arrest of the murderer for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Six Years Ago</h3>
<p>A Land Lawsuit Re-ignites</p>
<p>Both Parties Are Deceased</p>
<p>Family Members Continue to Request Retrial</p>
<p>Result: Zheng Wu Loses the Case</p>
<p>The land dispute lawsuit between Zheng Hua and Jin Xiaoyun, which went through two trials in the former Mixed Court, was brought up again in 1927 by Zheng's side, and was once again tried by the Concession Court of Appeal, which rendered a judgment. Six years have passed since then. Unexpectedly, it has now re-ignited. However, both parties are long deceased. Therefore, this time, Zheng is represented by his wife, Zheng Wu, and the defendant is Jin Xiaoyun's son, Jin Fenggang. Zheng Wu's reason for the lawsuit is that after the judgment by the former Mixed Court, she was dissatisfied and appealed to the former Shanghai Haidao Yamen. Now, she has found a draft of this appeal and should be considered newly discovered evidence. She has submitted it to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, requesting that the judgment of the former Court of Appeal be revoked and a retrial granted. Jin Fenggang also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to comprehensively argue the circumstances of the case, which has been tried by the court for more than twenty years from its occurrence to the present, requesting that the retrial be rejected to deter frivolous lawsuits. Judge Hu Min of the court, together with two judges, Ye and Cai, collected evidence, summoned witnesses, and concluded the trial. The judgment was that Zheng Wu's retrial was without merit and the retrial was dismissed. The costs of the litigation were to be borne by the retrial plaintiff. The verdict is recorded as follows: According to the civil procedure law, a party initiating a retrial must claim that the litigation procedure of the original final judgment, or the basis of the judgment, has a major defect as a reason for the litigation. Therefore, when initiating a retrial with newly discovered evidence that can benefit the ruling, the new evidence must have a direct relationship with the litigation procedure of the original final judgment, or the basis of the judgment, sufficient to shake the basis of the original final judgment. In this case, the plaintiff in the retrial did not reserve the right to appeal the judgment of the former Shanghai Public Concession Mixed Court on August 4, 1921. The former Shanghai Concession Court of Appeal rejected his appeal in a final judgment on May 4, 1927. Now, he has discovered that he filed an appeal with the former Shanghai Haidao Yamen on April 26 of the same month against the judgment of the former Mixed Court on April 10, 1922, etc. Regarding the final judgment of the former Shanghai Concession Court of Appeal, he has filed a retrial. Regardless of whether the draft he submitted is true or not, and whether the case file of Zheng Hua suing Jin Xiaoyun's wife for a land dispute and appealing against the review, which was transferred by the Shanghai County Government from the former Shanghai Haidao Yamen (according to the reply from the Shanghai County Government, this case file no longer exists), is the case file recorded in the draft of the appeal, or even if it is the case file, it cannot be proven whether it was rejected due to the appeal being overdue or for other reasons. Even if it can be recognized that the retrial plaintiff had legally appealed the review judgment of the former Mixed Court on April 10, 1922, it is still only related to that review judgment, and it has nothing to do with the litigation procedure of the final judgment of the former Shanghai Concession Court of Appeal on May 4, 1927, or the basis of the judgment, whether there is a defect. In other words, whether there was an appeal against the review judgment is one question, and the fact that the right to appeal was not reserved in the judgment of the former Mixed Court on August 4, 1921, and the final judgment of the former Shanghai Concession Court of Appeal rejecting the appeal is another question. One cannot claim that there is a reason for retrial because there was an appeal against the review judgment for the original final judgment for which the right to appeal was not reserved. The logic is very clear. According to the above explanation, his retrial has no reason for retrial. Moreover, after the recovery of the former Mixed Court, the former Shanghai Concession Provisional Court issued a notice on March 7, 1927, stating that all judgments of the Mixed Court in the past were considered valid and were final judgments. However, for civil cases where the right to appeal had been reserved and the judgment had not yet been executed, an appeal could be filed from March 11 to March 30 of this year, a period of 20 days. If the deadline was exceeded, the right to appeal was considered waived, and the judgment of the former Mixed Court was final, etc., which can be verified. Therefore, even if the retrial plaintiff had declared an appeal against the review judgment of the former Mixed Court on April 10, 1922, he should also be bound by the above notice, and there is no room for filing a retrial. Based on the above conclusions, this retrial has no reason for retrial. In accordance with Article 466, Article 96, and Article 81 of the Civil Procedure Law, the ruling is specially made as in the main text.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Illegal Trafficking of Arms Convicted</h3>
<p>Wang Runhe, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Patrol Station, and Xia Shutang, a detective, previously arrested eight people, including Xin Afang, Zhang Yongquan, and suspects Xu Genfa and Wei Jinzhang, from Ningbo, who were trafficking in arms at locations such as Broadway Road, No. 66 North Henan Road, the Andong Hotel, No. 217 Huade Road, and No. 233 Huaji Road. They also found a large amount of firearms, 20 pistols, and a total of 3,400 rounds of ammunition, including those found on Xin Afang's person, in the refrigerated compartment of the French postal ship "Torone" at Taiping Wharf. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been noted in previous reports. Yesterday, Judge Fu Lin presided over the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol station's lawyer, stated that it was found during the adjournment that the defendants Xu Genfa and Wei Jinzhang were not involved and requested their release. He also stated that there were a total of 34 pistols, and the remaining 14 were sold by a man named A Fa who was at large and could not be found. After Judge Fu questioned the defendants, their confessions were the same as before. He sentenced Xin Afang, Zhang Yongquan, Zhang Yongshou, and Xie Er to six months of imprisonment each, Zhang Lisan to eight months of imprisonment, and Wang Fangquan to a fine of 50 yuan. The number of days detained before the judgment became final were all deducted. The firearms and ammunition were confiscated. Xu Genfa and Wei Jinzhang were acquitted and released.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Headless Male Corpse</h3>
<p>The headless male corpse discovered on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai on the 25th of this month, after being examined by the district court, was investigated by detectives from the Sixth District. A woman named Gu Zhou was arrested in connection with the case and has been escorted to court for interrogation. It is now learned that the deceased's name was Liu Jinsheng, about 30 years old, from Taixing County, Jiangbei. He had lived near Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai for several years and was a well-known gangster in the Jiangbei gang. He was a very close confidant of Gu Defa, who lived at No. 48 Gujia Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, and is currently at large. Recently, Liu had a female cousin who was in her prime, beautiful, with watery eyes and a slender figure. Liu lured her to Shanghai and had an affair with her. Unexpectedly, Gu soon developed ulterior motives because the woman was beautiful and lively. He persuaded Liu to sell the woman for a large sum of money. Liu, fearing Gu's power and being greedy for huge profits, sold the woman to a brothel in Shanghai through Gu, obtaining a dowry of about 1,000 yuan. However, Liu only received more than 300 yuan. As soon as the money arrived, the woman's family in her hometown found out that she had been seduced by Liu and sent a letter to Liu a few days before the incident, instructing him to send the woman back, otherwise they would have to negotiate severely. After receiving the letter, Liu was extremely frightened and negotiated with Gu, willing to return the money and redeem the woman. Thus, Gu and Liu had a dispute for three days, which led to this tragic murder. It is said that the reason for Liu's murder was probably due to this. The fact that Gu Defa has fled out of fear makes this even more likely.</p>
<h3>Two Murder Cases</h3>
<p>Both Caused by Money</p>
<p>Shen Sanbao, a Ningbo native aged 26, working as a laundry assistant at No. 25 Ward Lane, Huade Road, Hongkou, was repeatedly approached for loans by his friends Wang A'gen and Wang Kaiming, who constantly harassed him. After giving them some money to appease them, they would leave. Yesterday morning around ten o'clock, the two approached Shen again with the same request. Shen Sanbao politely refused, so the two left in a huff and waited at the intersection of Dalian Road. Not long after, they saw Shen Sanbao approaching, blocked his path, and struck him five times with an axe on his arm, shoulder, and right leg, causing profuse bleeding. The assailants then fled. The injured man was transported to Tongren Hospital for treatment by a patrol car.</p>
<p>Zhao Yiming, a Jiangbei native aged 33, and his wife, Dai, aged 27, lived at No. 462 Daxing Lane, Dengtuo Road, Hongkou. Zhao worked as an accountant at the Nanyang Transportation Company on Zhaofeng Road, where he earned a good income and lived a comfortable life. Xu Tianfu, a fellow townsman and unemployed vagrant, held a long-standing grudge against Zhao Yiming due to an unsuccessful extortion attempt. He instructed his apprentice, Yu Xiliu, to harm Zhao Yiming. Yesterday evening around seven o'clock, Yu, acting on his master's orders, went to Zhao's home and, without asking any questions, struck Zhao on the right shoulder with an axe, inflicting a wound six or seven inches deep, causing a gush of blood. Zhao fell into a pool of blood, and the assailant took the opportunity to flee. The injured man was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by a patrol car summoned by his family.</p>
<p>French Concession Chinese Police Inspector</p>
<h3>Pan Qibao Died of Illness Yesterday Morning</h3>

<h3>White Sketch of a Tea Stall by Feng Water</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Accustomed to city life, I went to a small tea stall by the water outside Fengmen to sit for a while, hoping to change the air.</p>
<p>2 p.m.! It's the time when tea stalls outside the city are winding down. There were only three or five rural men and women nearby. Their special attire was felt hats for the men and black cloth headscarves for the women, with a knot tied at the back of their heads.</p>
<p>I felt that there were materials suitable for white sketch in this, so I wrote on the paper with a sharpened pencil. The holy laborer next to me glanced at me. He didn't know what I was writing, so he turned his head to smoke his yellow tobacco.</p>
<p>I was sitting on the right side of the railing near the water. I saw more than ten stalks of okra flowers rising behind a short fence on the opposite bank, with large, divergent, chicken-claw-like leaves. The flowers on top were like beeswax, like a magnifed wintersweet plum. It's a pity that no one appreciates the flowers when they bloom. The only one who appreciates it is my sharpened pencil.</p>
<p>Several white geese wading on the river beach with their necks raised seemed to look down on everything. Suddenly, three or five ducks floated leisurely, and the geese flapped their two white feathered fans, calling out three times. Were the geese welcoming the ducks? Or were they disgusted by the ducks? Perhaps the three calls were like the salutes fired on the military field, as a sign of respect for meeting on the water. But there was no Gongye Chang who understood the language of birds to be a witness. The river water outside the city is wider and clearer than that in the city. Several water caltrop boats swayed past, and several barges carrying people swayed to the shore. Seven or eight out of ten passengers were women burning incense with yellow cloth sachets around their necks. Seeing this strange appearance, I couldn't help but laugh secretly, laughing at them for not being able to open the door of superstition. But I also laughed at myself. Believing in gods and Buddhas is like believing in the imperial examination. More than 30 years ago, when I went to the Gongyuan to take the exam, I also had a roll bag around my neck that was the same size as the incense bag, just as strange as the women burning incense.</p>
<p>The quiet tea stall suddenly became lively. The women burning incense on the barge all came to the tea stall to eat snacks. My seat was squeezed! I had to pay eight copper coins for the tea and give up my seat.</p>
<h3>Loss of Territory in the Three Northeastern Provinces?</h3>
<p>— Li Yuan</p>
<p>Don't You Know</p>
<p>Mr. Gloomy: Don't sweep away eighteen cockroaches with one broom, scolding all of us Chinese for not knowing the number of miles of lost territory in the Northeast! I can clearly say the number of miles, returning it to your mother's home, but I certainly didn't go to the three northeastern provinces to investigate, nor did I see it in books. A cartography expert, Mr. Hua Min, told me. I saw in the newspaper the other day that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to twelve countries regarding Japan's recognition of the puppet organization, stating that "Japan seized about 400,000 square miles of Chinese territory by force, and disregarded the advice of friendly countries to formally recognize the illegal organization it created there." The average person thinks that the official documents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are always accurate, and that the lost territory in the Northeast must be 400,000 square miles. But I still doubted it. In my mind, I remembered that it was more than that. So I asked my friend Mr. Hua Min. Mr. Hua Min said: The number cited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not correct. Let me tell you, on the measured maps of our country, it clearly says that Liaoning Province has an area of 865,000 square miles; Jilin Province has an area of 882,000 square miles; Heilongjiang has an area of 1,785,000 square miles. You go and calculate it. Even if we don't consider Jehol, isn't the area of the three northeastern provinces 3,532,000 square miles? Japan, which seized our three northeastern provinces by force, had already carefully calculated it for us before it got it. On the maps it published, it said that Liaoning Province has an area of 551,790 square miles, Jilin Province has an area of 727,352 square miles; Heilongjiang has an area of 1,756,970 square miles; according to its calculations, the three northeastern provinces also have 3,036,112 square miles. The number 400,000 cited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if it is a mistake of one hundred, then it is so-so, not too far off. Otherwise, it is too far off!</p>
<p>Mr. Hua Min said this, so you know that many Chinese people are concerned about the loss of territory in the Northeast, and many know the number of miles of lost territory.</p>
<h3>Sleeping on Brushwood and Tasting Gall</h3>
<p>— Bi Cheng</p>
<p>What Is the Explanation?</p>
<p>Since the national crisis became increasingly urgent, the ancient saying of sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall has been seen in telegrams and heard in speeches, almost always in people's minds. But after repeated examination, the people who send telegrams and give speeches still sleep on brocade quilts and eat delicacies from land and sea, without any painful meaning of sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall. Recently, I heard someone relay Mr. Ma Er's new interpretation. He said that the so-called "sleeping on brushwood" by us Chinese is a synonym for not having to work and being able to get money; that is, lying high and receiving a salary. However, Mr. Ma Er also said that he hasn't yet figured out what "tasting gall" means. I said that it is even easier to get a definite explanation for this: it simply means "trying to have courage," daring to do anything. Didn't people used to have two sayings? One was called "measure before entering," and the other was called "retreat when you know it's difficult." This clearly means that they didn't have the courage to try, so they stopped at the sight of it. Today's people all have omnipotent skills; what can't they try? What don't they have the courage to do? If you want to lie high and receive a salary, you just need to try to have courage. This is called sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall.</p>

<h3>Quick Sketches of Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>A Comparison of the Two Sides</p>
<p>I recently took a trip to Nanjing on business. Based on what I saw and heard in one day, I made these quick sketches of Beijing and Shanghai:</p>
<p>(1) Nanjing seems to be learning from Shanghai. You can tell by the foreign houses along the main roads and the women who brush their hair on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>(2) The foreign houses in Nanjing seem to be leaning towards crowding. In a few years, I'm afraid that Nanjing's residences will become Shanghai's pigeon cages again, which would be a real misery.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai is too foreign, with Western suits everywhere. Nanjing is too official, with diagonally worn leather belts everywhere. Too much foreignness leads to "slavery." Too much officialdom leads to "corruption."</p>
<p>(4) Nanjing has a particularly large number of organizations! "X Division's Office in Nanjing" is almost everywhere. Each place is a foreign house. I think it would be best to unite them together, which would be convenient for contact and save construction costs.</p>
<p>(5) Foreign car dealerships and trading companies stand majestically on both sides of the road. Where are China's own factories? Impossible to find! Therefore, what I hope for in Nanjing is to eliminate officialdom and strive for scientific construction.</p>
<h3>Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>— Huang Ying Dai</p>
<p>Everyone Knows How to Perform Magic, But Each Has Their Own Unique Skills.</p>
<p>Niu Lan was arrested and imprisoned for promoting communism. He then invented the method of hunger strike, which did indeed prompt Chinese scholars to jointly request his release on bail.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Workers at the Sanyou Factory, because the factory stopped working and they had no way to make a living, used the method of hunger strike to urge the capitalists to wake up, but the capitalists insisted on maintaining the original proposal and refused to resume operations.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Gandhi, in order to implement his views and break class concepts, used hunger strike as a final struggle. As a result, he obtained the understanding of the British government and signed an agreement.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>A certain gentleman, because of unrequited love, followed Gandhi and Niu Lan, thinking to use the method of hunger strike to save the heart of his lover, but his lover finally went with someone else.</p>

<p>This is what is meant by everyone knows how to perform magic, but each has their own unique skills. The effect of hunger strike, success or failure, also has its similarities and differences. Rotary Club of Storytellers</p>
<h3>Post Office Companion</h3>
<p>— Qiu Xing Fu Zhai Zhu</p>
<p>The situation inside is not very monotonous. There are colleagues who have families and dependents, and some who temporarily bring their wives and children here to stroll together. Looking at their expressions, they are very happy. There are also some unmarried young people who are pursuing women on the path of love that everyone must go through. They have also met some girlfriends, or have even become lovers. They also make appointments to come here for a stroll and have a quiet conversation. That kind of extremely passionate expression of love even sets off this quiet park, which is as beautiful as the Garden of Eden, and not boring or desolate at all.</p>
<p>At this time, a young man who was just over twenty years old was wandering alone around the pavilion, constantly looking around, as if looking for someone. But after waiting for a long time, he never left the pavilion. It seemed as if he had agreed to meet someone at this designated location and could not leave without permission. From the time he started wandering here at four thirty, he had been waiting for more than two hours. Looking at the hands of the post office clock tower, it seemed that it had already reached six fifty. The person he was waiting for still had not come, and the young man was getting a little impatient. Sometimes he leaned against the pavilion pillar, resting his chin on his hands in contemplation. Sometimes he ran to the lawn, scratching his head and walking back and forth. Occasionally, he stared at the passing tourists, and seemed to pay special attention to women dressed as female students. Suddenly, as if he had discovered the person he was longing for, he rushed over excitedly. But after taking a closer look, he immediately realized that it was a mistaken identification, shook his head, blushed, and walked away dejectedly, unable to help but let out a deep sigh of frustration.</p>
<p>Later, it was probably past seven o'clock. He continued to perform these many futile and ridiculous actions. His spirit was already extremely unstable, and at the same time, his body felt unusually tired. He sat down on a low wooden railing by the pavilion with his head hanging down, and gradually confirmed a confident judgment: if she doesn't come now, she won't come today! However, the reasons for her not coming are still complex and multifaceted: Is she sick? Did something happen to prevent her? Did she intend to break her promise to me? Did something unexpected and important happen? All sorts of questions, as messy as the hair he scratched, still made him think anxiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the back of his head felt like it had been lightly tapped with a brick. Just as he was about to turn around, a very familiar and sweet laughter penetrated his ears.</p>
<p>"Hey! You've been waiting here anxiously, haven't you? I'm sorry, I was really held up by something else. But sooner or later, I was going to come anyway."</p>

<h3>Please Watch Two Good Plays</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The three northeastern provinces are just like being murdered by a thug for money, and the family members dare not go to collect the body for burial, but instead let the thug issue a funeral announcement. It's really a strange situation. The family members have no way to deal with it, so they can only report it to the police station, but the police station doesn't dare to go to arrest the thug either, only sending a few capable police officers to the scene to investigate. It's even more pitiful. Japan's recognition of the puppet Manchurian state is no different from issuing a funeral announcement for our country. The Investigative Committee's report to the League of Nations is no different from the police reporting to the headquarters after investigating the case.</p>
<p>In this serious situation, a good play is being staged at home. In the east, there is the conflict between Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian. In the west, there is the infighting between Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang. The martial arts drama in the east is about to end, but it hasn't ended yet. The martial arts drama in the west is just starting. Suppose the good plays on both stages are only those that are publicly announced (such as Han and Liu's telegrams, etc.), then the matter would be easier to resolve. If there are other complex reasons involved, then it would be even more unthinkable. Others scold our country for only having clean stone lions in front of the door. Now we are even more embarrassing ourselves, giving others an excuse and material for jokes. What are they thinking?</p>
<p>We, these actors, are really actors. We can only show off our power and wave our fists on the Chinese stage. Once the audience boos or disrupts the show, we slip away and hide behind the scenes, afraid to come out. I ask, what is the value of such actors? They can only be used as entertainment. Thank you very much. The strength of you actor gentlemen is like lighting a fire on a toilet lid. You can see the light, but there's no need to embarrass yourself again.</p>
<p>For its own benefit, the League of Nations is unwilling to have a large piece of meat swallowed by the Japanese day by day, undermining its policy of equal opportunity. It still comes out to say a few fair words. If it were completely unrelated, it would have already "closed the door and pushed the moon out the window, not caring about the frost on other people's roofs." Now that the League of Nations Investigative Committee's report has been released yesterday, it is said (when writing this article, it has not yet been released) that the conclusion of the report generally advocates the return of sovereignty to China and the granting of economic development rights to Japan. I think that this proposal is to return the empty name to our country and give the real benefits to Japan. What use is this empty name to China? Moreover, Japan is constantly making tough statements and will not accept this kind of appeasement policy.</p>
<p>Now I will speak frankly and bluntly. Our country, from top to bottom, should no longer live in a dream and no longer hope for the League of Nations. Those who are willing to be slaves of a conquered nation should immediately carry the flag of obedient people, carry food and drink, and go to the northeast to welcome the Japanese. Those who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation should "rather be a shattered piece of jade than a whole tile." If we have one soldier, one soldier, one gun, one bullet, we should fight to the death with the Japanese. We must die happily and live happily. Don't be like the people of Suzhou, beating around the bush, "only hearing the sound of the young lady's footsteps but not seeing the young lady coming downstairs," making people itch unbearably. Look at the bravery of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, how brave and hardworking they are. We can only wear a mask and hide at home in shame, letting the general volunteers take the lead.</p>
<p>Have you all heard what Mr. Tang Shaoyi said? He said, "What is legal and illegal to the League of Nations? Only a hard fist is legal."</p>

<h3>Study of the Human Body</h3>
<p>— ·Shen·Yong</p>
<p>In this science column, we have seen many works on physics and chemistry, but there has been little discussion on the aspects of human physiology and hygiene. Therefore, I will make a scientific analysis of the human body, and then discuss the general methods of hygiene.</p>
<p>Anyone can understand the external parts of the human body, divided into three parts: the head, trunk, and limbs. The head includes the five senses of ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. The chest and abdomen belong to the trunk, and the limbs are divided into upper and lower limbs.</p>
<p>As for what these many parts are made of, then we must examine the chemical composition. It turns out that the main elements of the human body are carbon (Carleon), oxygen (Oxygen), hydrogen (Hydrogen), nitrogen (Nitrogen), phosphorus (Phospborus), and sulfur (Sulbhur).</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In addition, there are bromine, chlorine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, etc., which constitute the organic substances (OrganicSubstances) and inorganic substances (InorganicSubstances) of the various parts of the human body. The so-called organic matter is protein (Protein) that makes cells, fats (Fats) and carbohydrates (Carhohydrate) that protect body temperature and maintain vitality. Inorganic matter is water (Watei) that carries nutrients and excretes waste, and salts (Saits) are also important components of bones, flesh, and blood.</p>
<p>Now, I will talk about the common methods of hygiene and nutrition for the human body. The various components mentioned above are the essential elements for maintaining vitality. Over time, they will be exhausted, so the development and growth of the human body, and the maintenance of vitality, must be supplemented from the outside world. Moreover, to maintain growth and development according to normal routines without losing normalcy, various methods must be employed, and each is described below:</p>
<p>First, eat foods that can adequately replenish the various components of the human body at regular times every day, such as grains, eggs, milk, beans, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the portions must be appropriately allocated. Second, protect the digestive organs, brush your teeth more often, and do not eat overly cold, overly hot, or overly acidic foods to preserve healthy teeth. Moreover, do not overeat or drink immoderately, but get adequate sleep and exercise to protect the stomach and intestines.</p>
<p>Third, maintain the hygiene of the circulatory system, never drink alcohol or smoke, and further ensure sufficient exercise and massage and bathing to keep the blood circulation in order.</p>
<p>Fourth, breathe more fresh air and absorb oxygen, so the room should have more open windows and more outdoor exercise.</p>
<p>Fifth, considerable attention must also be paid to the excretory organs. Do not forcibly hold back urination or defecation, and do not eat too many spicy and stimulating drinks, so as not to damage the health of the kidneys. It is also necessary to keep the skin clean so that the metabolism (Metabolism) can operate in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>If you can follow the above common rules, you can grow and develop well, and you will not have to worry about unexpected illnesses or other things happening. However, finally, it must be added that you must try your best to prevent and isolate the invasion of external infectious diseases, so that no danger will occur.</p>

<h3>Proposal for Reorganizing School Fees</h3>
<p>— ·Yan·Ye</p>
<p>Since education has become aristocratic, the children of poor people can only sigh at the school gates. Moreover, the higher the school level, the higher its threshold, which hinders education more than anything else. Try opening the school's regulations and looking at its fee schedule, which is divided into categories and has many items, including: (1) tuition fees, (2) food fees, (3) accommodation fees, (4) book or lecture fees, (5) library fees, (6) experiment fees, (7) foundation funds, (8) security deposits, (9) miscellaneous fees, (10) sports fees. Of course, not every school has these ten types of fees, but there are quite a few that collect them all. I believe that these many types of fees should be vigorously reorganized by the competent authorities. I am offering my humble opinion for consideration.</p>
<p>(1) Tuition fees. I remember that the Ministry of Education had regulations on the tuition fees of schools at all levels. The principle was that elementary school students should not pay tuition fees, but they could be collected in moderation depending on local conditions, but there were also limits (the amount was very small, seemingly only two or three yuan per student per semester, the exact number is no longer remembered, and there is nothing to check). Now, some elementary school students pay more than twenty yuan in tuition fees in one semester. In the same municipal elementary school, some only charge two or three yuan, while others charge as much as ten or more yuan. The amounts for middle schools and above are not uniform and are arbitrarily increased. I believe that the competent authorities should refer to the Ministry's regulations and, depending on local conditions, set a compromise number for public schools and require all schools to follow it uniformly. For private schools, which do not receive public subsidies, they should set a separate standard that is 40% to 50% higher than public schools. If any private increase is found, they should be investigated and punished immediately.</p>
<p>(2) Food fees. Schools really make money from food fees. For example, if the school starts on September 1st this semester and ends at the end of January, it is a total of five months. Excluding summer and winter vacations, the actual time in school is at most four months, but the food fee paid is more than thirty yuan, averaging eight or nine yuan per month. The food that schools give to students is mostly not worth this amount, and because there are so many people, there are even cheaper deals. Therefore, some schools make hundreds of yuan a month on this food fee. The principal wants to swallow it all, and the teachers want to share the spoils, causing a storm. From now on, the education authorities should order all schools to return the remaining money to the students to lighten their burden.</p>
<p>(3) Book and lecture fees. Schools purchase books in bulk from bookstores and are entitled to discounts. They should sell them to students at the discounted price, and should not sell them at the actual price. As for manuscript paper and ink, they must never fleece the students in any way. Now that book prices are rising year after year, schools should be more considerate of the burden on students' parents. As for lecture fees, they should also be calculated based on actual cost, and it is unacceptable to charge half a yuan or one yuan and then issue dozens of sheets of paper and call it done. If overcharged, students should be allowed to report to the education authorities, who should impose sanctions.</p>
<p>(4) Accommodation fees. Accommodation fees should be determined based on the rent situation in the school's location and the space occupied by each student. I have seen some schools where more than ten people sleep in a small room, with beds next to each other, and there is almost no space to walk. The air is even unbearably foul, but they still charge each person fifteen yuan per semester for accommodation.</p>
<p>(5) Library fees. The library is an indispensable facility in a school and should be funded by the school to purchase books. If the expenses are insufficient and students are charged, then the fees collected should be used entirely for purchasing books. For example, if there are five hundred students, and each person pays two yuan per semester for library fees, then they will get one thousand yuan, and two thousand yuan a year. By this logic, the amount is astonishing. With annual additions, there should be enough books to fill the shelves. However, looking at the library, it is only a small room, with limited books, and it is just a facade, just going through the motions, with most of the library fees being diverted to other uses, or even pocketed privately. Therefore, the competent authorities should pay attention to whether the fees collected match the books purchased.</p>
<p>(6) Experiment fees. The laboratory is as important as the library. Schools often collect money in the name of experiments, but only purchase a small amount of specimens, instruments, and chemicals to satisfy students. The competent authorities should also see if the fees collected match the items purchased.</p>
<p>(7) Foundation funds. Schools often collect foundation funds from students in the name of building school buildings, but in reality, they are mostly diverted to other uses. The competent authorities should order them to deposit the funds into a designated bank, to be managed with interest. If they do not comply, they should be ordered to return the funds to the students, and they should not be allowed to collect them again in the next semester.</p>
<p>(8) Security deposits. Schools often collect five yuan or ten yuan as security deposits from students, saying that it is for compensation for damage to school equipment and items. I think that if a student damages something within five or ten yuan at school, he will definitely not run away. There is really no need for this pawnshop-style security deposit. If he damages or steals something worth hundreds or thousands of yuan and runs away, then what can his mere five or ten yuan compensate for?</p>
<p>Therefore, the competent authorities should order all schools to abolish this security deposit. (9) Sports fees. Sports equipment, like the library and laboratory, should be borne by the school. I have seen many schools where there is only a basketball hoop and a high jump stand and a few balls on the playground, but the sports fee is two yuan per student per semester. Therefore, the competent authorities should also strictly order them to use all the fees collected for equipment.</p>
<p>(10) Miscellaneous fees. The water used by students for washing and bathing at school, as well as the test papers, are all provided by the school, so each person has to pay a few dimes or yuan for miscellaneous fees. However, some schools actually require students to pay for test paper, and students have to pay for boiling water for bathing. This is truly exploitation to the extreme. They have already paid a lot for tuition, food, and accommodation, so don't they even want to give these things away for free? Therefore, these miscellaneous fees should be ordered to be abolished by all schools.</p>
<p>In addition to the above ten types, there are also student union fees, publication fees, graduation certificate fees, etc., which should also be abolished. If the education authorities in various places can vigorously reorganize the fees charged by schools, then first, educational efficiency will be greatly improved; second, profit-driven schools will close down without being banned; and third, the burden on students' parents will be somewhat lighter. It is a win-win-win situation. I hope that local authorities will take action, and I hope that my colleagues in this association will criticize and discuss.</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>
<h3>Regret</h3>
<p>— ·Tong</p>
<p>Usually, everyone meets and is like a young woman, chatting and laughing, very happy. In the past few days, things have not been going smoothly. Mr. Yu always frowns and doesn't say a word. If you ask him repeatedly, he just manages a muffled laugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu likes to dress up. From head to toe, he is always shiny and neat, but he has never known trouble. He hasn't received a registered letter in three months. It's not dignified enough to ask someone for money, so he went from embarrassment to extreme panic. He only eats a few pancakes a day and drinks a copper's worth of boiled water. Once, the landlady saw him, and his cheeks immediately flushed. He didn't even have a word of excuse.</p>
<p>He probably hadn't read the newspaper for many days. He got up early in the morning and ran to the street to buy a copy of Shen Bao. Especially because for the past few days, the landlady, after eating breakfast, dressed in bright colors and ran out. She returned fully loaded at four or five in the afternoon. "All kinds of goods are so cheap now, if you miss this opportunity, you deserve to die! Haha!" The landlady's laughter was full of excitement, making him itch unbearably. No matter how great the sacrifice, he had to buy a newspaper and get to the bottom of it. He eagerly read the advertisements column by column. The words "buy one get one free" were like a devil enticing him under his eyes. The Shen Bao paper fell to his feet, and his body stood still like a wooden chicken. He turned around and threw himself into the rattan chair. "What a bastard, why hasn't the money been sent for so many days, damn it!" he said to himself.</p>
<p>All afternoon, he wrote a quick letter full of boiling anger and mailed it. After returning from the post office, he prayed silently every day that the green-clad messenger would quickly tell him the news he longed for. Indeed, the registered letter was received. Mr. Yu's face everywhere contained a triumphant smile. When night covered the earth, he rushed out and stayed overnight in Shanghai. The next day, he drunkenly ran to my house and sat on the bed without saying a word, staring blankly at the floor. I was puzzled. He usually didn't like to drink much. Today's situation was really confusing.</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's killing me! The past few days were so good,"</p>
<p>Every company was "having a big sale..." Now that my money has arrived, they're not, not having sales anymore!"</p>
<p>"Why did you drink so much wine? Are you really happy?" I didn't pay attention to his words, so I asked him that. He was a little angry when he heard my words and paused before saying:</p>
<p>"The things I wanted to buy are either sold out or not on sale anymore... Hmph! How can I not drink when I'm so happy?" He opened the door and walked out. I asked him where he was going, but he didn't answer. Finally, he answered my question with two short phrases:</p>
<p>"Regret! Regret!..."</p>
<p>No Way Out</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of the Unemployed</h3>
<p>— ·Yin</p>
<p>Mrs. Li is really anxious now. The state of consternation simply makes her restless. She looked out the window repeatedly, hoping to see her husband return quickly and happily.</p>
<p>Of course, her husband had been unemployed for more than a year. Now, he was fortunate to have the opportunity to contact a certain company about his job, which she thought was a great hope. So, success or failure depends on this negotiation. The negotiation is so important, how can she not be overly anxious about the worry of yet another failure? Moreover, this was like many times before, where he patiently answered advertisements in the newspaper. However, many times were failures, and he didn't even receive a single reply. But now, he received a reply from a certain company inviting him to talk, which seemed somewhat reliable. But after one or two failures, after many failures, could she guarantee that he would not fail again this time? Failure was still possible! Therefore, this was precisely what made Mrs. Li very consternated.</p>
<p>Finally, her husband returned after all. When he entered the door, she rushed up as if mad, letting her husband hug her tightly and kiss her lips. Afterwards, looking into his eyes filled with a joyful glow, he said breathlessly:</p>
<p>"Now we have forty yuan a month." "Ah? Did the negotiation go well?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in the writing room, forty yuan a month."</p>
<p>She was so happy that she couldn't speak and again hugged him tightly and kissed him madly.</p>
<p>"But there is still a difficult problem!" This was what her husband said.</p>
<p>"What is it?" The wife was stunned again.</p>
<p>"Listen to me... didn't he write to invite me to go at ten o'clock? But when I got there, it was only nine thirty. So, in order to abide by the time he had agreed upon, I couldn't be too early, so I walked back and forth on the nearby road, watching the big clock in the distance just point to ten o'clock, and then I walked towards the company. (At that time, I thought that if my pocket watch hadn't been pawned, then I wouldn't have arrived too early.) But the clerk said, 'The manager hasn't arrived yet,' looked at me coldly a few times, and told me to wait in a corner. Of course, I had to wait humbly. At that time, I thought that maybe the manager's watch had a problem, or it wouldn't be so late for the agreed time. It wasn't until almost eleven o'clock that a clerk led me into that tall room. The manager was a big guy, almost a cartoon character. In comparison, I looked very small. He looked me up and down carefully, and then said with a straight face, 'Can you write business letters?' Of course, I said, 'Yes,' and told him where I had worked before. Afterwards, he said, 'Okay, you can work here on trial for two months. But the pay here is very low, a monthly salary of forty yuan, without food and accommodation, working ten hours a day, and you have to pay a security deposit of one hundred yuan first, otherwise, a reputable business can also guarantee you.' Of course, I had to tell him that I had difficulties, but in the end, he was especially accommodating, asking me to start working first and then make up the guarantee later. You see, isn't this a difficult problem? Where do you want us to find a guarantor?"</p>
<p>"Then what should we do?" she said.</p>
<p>"There's no way... but I think if there's no other way, we'll just let him deduct two and a half months' salary first."</p>
<p>"Then what will we eat and where will we live?" "Yes!..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Li sighed deeply, and her husband sighed even more.</p>
<p>This made her and him hate modern society a lot more.</p>
<p>They further realized the sorrow of the unemployed.</p>
