<p>時評</p>
<h3>本年總預算之批判彬</h3>
<p>本月九日立法院一八一次會議通過二十年度歲入歲出總預算。支出項下計爲八萬九千三百萬。其中軍務費達二萬七千九百萬。（第二級槪算時原列七萬二千餘萬幾適合於收入全數初經主計處核减爲三萬一千萬繼復經中央政治會議核减如今數）佔支出全數三分之一强。即黨費亦達六百萬。而政費則僅一千萬。敎育文化費僅一千百餘萬。實業費僅五百餘萬。交通費僅三百餘萬。建設費僅一百餘萬。就支出各項之性質而觀。不健全之支出。實佔最大百分數。反之健全之支出。則爲數極微。尤以軍費之支出。高列第一位。即不應歸國庫負担之黨費。亦增至六百萬。（十七年度爲四百餘萬）此種不符於現代財政支出原則之預算。吾人實不能不表示異論。我國邇年以來。財政已陷入破產之狀態。致此之　結。即爲由於財政支出之不健全。換言之。即背乎經濟的原則。蓋國家財政之支出。宜以扶植生產培養國民經濟之繁榮爲依歸。而我國今日之財政支出。則不僅不能扶植生產。甚且妨碍生產。破壞生產。以故國民經濟日益凋敝民生日窮蹙。而國家財政亦日陷入枯竭之困境。此爲吾人今日所應認清者也。</p>
<p>國家養兵二百餘萬。而各省各縣之團防。保安警察。尚未列入。軍費二萬餘</p>
<p>萬。而團防費清鄉費以及種種變相之軍費。亦尚未列入。國家罄國帑。人民榨血汗以養軍。然而軍隊之所以報我國家與人民者。除鴉片土匪内亂以及種</p>
<p>種暴戾專恣之行爲外。果尙有何物乎。有土不能守。有侮不能禦。軍費愈鉅軍額愈增。而鴉片流毒乃愈廣土匪爲愈多内亂乃愈綿延内戰一興交通告爲阻滯。生產事業。皆爲破產。故我國之軍隊。除極少數能認清其責任者外。非以衛團。適以害國然則二萬餘萬鉅額軍費之支也究何爲乎吾人認爲我國今日而言整頓財政。安定國是。非是先從裁軍與裁减軍費着手不可。二十年來軍閥之禍國殃民豈尙未足以喚起吾人之覺悟耶</p>
<p>至於海軍。則尤殆僅有海軍費用之支出。而並無海軍其物。吾人雖亦見吾國領海中泊有數隊陳舊之砲艦然而此次上海戰禍爆發。日艦長驅以入我海港我海軍竟未見以一彈相遺而日海軍亦竟未對之攻擊即此一點亦已爲我人民所大惑。此次移海軍臨時費一千一百萬爲擴充空軍用。誠爲吾人所贊同。但吾人認爲我國海軍整頓旣不可能。擴充又無從爲力。固何如根本裁撤。移此爢費。以用於敎育。實業建設爲較設爲較爲有益乎。</p>
<p>再如黨費。徵諸世界各國。政黨雖操縱全國政治而其組織事務則視爲私人活動。黨費支出。槪由黨員私人担負。並不出於國帑。獨有我國旣年費二萬餘萬鉅額之軍費以養無用之兵。復費六百餘萬鉅額之黨費。使一部分黨員倚黨爲衣食之所。爲生存之職業。黨部成衙門成官僚政客之養成所。此項支出之毫無意義殆亦同於養兵吾人今敢問政府。基於財政支出之原則而言。</p>
<p>是項支出。是否亦有立即予以裁撤之必要。今反逐年增鉅。究具有若何理由。開源節流。爲整理財政之根本願則。就二十年度之財政預算支出而言。旣不積極關源復不消極節流而欲求財政之不日趨於破產顧。可得耶。</p>

<h3>調查團由京西上情况（四）</h3>
<p>附錄國聯處置中日糾紛經過日本反提案與原案不同之要點爲、要求中國先行承認其所謂基本原則、換句話說、即我國承認二十一條欵關於滿洲及蒙古之處置、所謂直接交涉、及中日派員協商退兵辦法兩層、意義甚深、在表面看來、似祇以大兵威迫我國承認其條件、實則除此之外、尚含有中日問題不準第三者干涉之意幸我們尚未墜其中彀中、不然、國聯公約及非戰公約均在東省失其效力了、</p>
<p>（六）日本五項基本原則的討論日本的反提案、要求中國承認其所謂五項基本原則、是等於借國聯之力、以攫取滿洲、此爲國聯所反對及美國所不許的、當十月二十三開會的時候、各代表早窺破其陰謀、英代表薛西爾爵士、首先質問日代</p>
<p>表、所謂五項基本原則、究是什麽、根據日内瓦報載、日本政府所謂基本原則、乃指中日條約中某種的規定、使該報所傳爲事實、則所謂基本原則乃另有用意、與日僑生命財產之安全、毫無關係、今日代表要求行政院通過其修改的提案、而對所謂基本原則、又不欲加以解釋、似未免欺人太甚、况條約解釋、屬於法律問題、根據國聯公約、隨時可以訴諸海牙國際法庭、日本何以捨此不圖而訴諸武力、此爲吾人所大有解者薛西爾之外、尚有西班牙代表馬達利亞加的駁論最爲痛快、他說國聯公約第十條爲公約中最重要的一條、根據該條的規定日本有尊重中國領土完整及政治獨立的義務現在有一國家非法用兵侵入他國境内而說不能撤兵因撤兵之後該國僑民生命財產恐將受危害而不知危險環境之造成、該國亦應負一部份的責任日代表强以日僑安全問題與其所謂基本原則混爲一團、凡此種種、將開未來最危險的先例西代表又說、觀察日代表的意見、因爲在滿日僑無保障所以日兵不能撤退因爲該處不安靖所以日僑無保障、若要滿洲安靖惟有强中國承認其所謂數項基本原則、但日本政府目下又不能將基本原則内容宣佈、這眞是不可思議的悶壺蘆爲人所不可解的、然而各國代表儘欲與之講道理而日代表祗冷靜的答道、你們的說話、雖然是有理、可惜我們不能和你們同意至於何謂基本原則、我因未得政府訓令不能宣佈、</p>
<p>白里安知道日代表態度、無可轉圜乃毅然說日代表旣要求行政院贊成其含有數項基本原則的修正案而又拒絕解釋所謂基本原則的用意未免令行政院犧牲太大、這是絕對不可能的事、說完宣佈散會、這是十月二十日第十五次會議的大略情形、</p>
<p>那天下午、復開會議主席先將日本的反提案付表决、結果除日代表外、餘均反對、次將行政院預備的草案付表决結果以十三票對一票通過、除日本外、餘均贊成、該决議案就法律上說來、日本因未贊同、故没有執行的義務因根據國聯公約第五條第一項的規定國聯一切决議除明白規定的事項及關於手續問題外、應得全體一致通過才生效力、現在中日糾紛乃根據公約第十一條提出討論、故决議案亦須得行政院委員一致的通過、</p>
<p>戊·關於中日條約的我國宣言日本自兵佔東省之後即極力向國聯宣傳謂中國破壞國際條約、危害日本在滿洲權利日本爲自衛起見乃不得不訴諸武力日代表在會議席上責備國聯輕視條約的神聖、十月二十四日英代表曾在行政院宣言、謂國聯非不遵重條約的神聖、但關於條約的糾紛、應用仲裁等方法以解决之、無論如何不應驟然訴諸武力、我國代表爲</p>
<p>使世界明白我國非有意破壞國際條約起見、於十月二十四日曾致行政院主席一宣言大意說根據國聯公約的規定、中國所負執行條約的義務、與其他國聯會員國家無異中國政府對於國聯公約所賦予的義務、亦必誠意執行現爲表示中國的誠意起見、特鄭重聲明中國政府隨時都可以根據國聯公約第十二條、採用仲裁或司法</p>
<p>方法、與日本解决一切關於解釋條約的爭論、又說、爲實行這項主張、中國政府已預備與日本訂定一種如中國與美國最近所訂定的仲裁條約、這種條約是近年來國聯會員間亦有少訂定的、這種宣言是拒絕日本要求直接交涉及承認所謂基本原則的光明磊落的辦法、頗得各國的同情、</p>
<p>已·關於日本五項基本原則的筆戰（一日）政府關於五原則的宣言日本以不可思議的所謂五項基本原則請行政院贊成而又拒絕解釋其意義、故人皆以日本爲欺國聯太甚行政院閉會之後、日本政府於十月二十六日發表解釋其所謂基本原則的宣言、日本的所謂基本原則、分爲五項㈠互相抛棄侵犯的政策及行動、㈡尊重中國領圭的完整、㈢取締一切有碍貿易自由及激起國際間仇視的有組織的運動㈣切實保障在滿日僑和平的企業、㈤尊重日本在滿洲由條約所得的利權、該宣言的第一二三四項純粹是外交的辭令藉以博得國際的同情而第項則自然是包含二十一條欵關於滿蒙的規定、</p>
<p>）二（行政院主席之駁答行政院主席接該宣言後、於十月二十九日予日代表以一答覆、大意說、行政院十月二十四日的草案雖未獲全體一致通過然亦具有精神上的效力、而九月三十日的决議案於法律上日本有執行的義務關於日本二十六日宣言中一二三四項的意義行政院十月二十二日的草案已經包含在内、又爲中國所贊成、且日本反提案一二三項、其用意亦不邁如是、至於日本宣言中關於條約問題的第四項根據中國代表十月二十四日的宣言已明白對行政院及日本聲明執行一切條約的義務、而與日本所謂基本原則是完全符合的、</p>
<p>（三）日政府的牢騷辯駁日政府接白里安的答覆後、即大發牢騷並答覆白里安大意說貴主席說日本的基本原則、一二三四項意義已被包含於十月二十四日行政院草案之内而不知該草案的一二三四項實遠不如日本基本原則的第一二三四項、的清楚及廣博關於日本基本原則第五項、根據中國代表十月二十四日致貴主席的宣言、對於中日間某種條約的效力似乎發生疑問、須知這種條約是中日邦交的基礎、故日本政府絕對不能承認中國這種言論爲合理、日本認定中國未承認日本五項原則以前、日僑在滿洲的生命財產必不得充分的保障、則日本軍隊亦不能撤回南滿鐵路線範圍以内、</p>
<p>庚·各國之態度</p>
<p>英法美等强國、至此已覺日本的恃强無理、自侵入東省後、不特毫無退兵的意思目擴大戰事範圍至北寗路線、最初說南滿路被毀、繼則說日僑生命財產未得保障、而現在又要求中國承認其所謂五項基本原則、故當時態度確極强硬、觀於一方面美國毅然派員列席國聯行政院會議、及單獨向日作維持非戰公約的照會、英代表破面質問芳澤日使、法外長以主席名義與日政府筆戰、及行政院草案的限期撤兵、一套一套的外交方法都完全使用出來了雖然我們猶以此爲未足、然更進一步即爲列强對日絕交、或由絕交而至用武、就當時的環境看來、却是萬難做到的、至於意大利及德國自知力量薄弱、祇隨從英法的趨向、其餘諸小國則更無能爲力了、</p>
<p>辛·關於日本扣留鹽稅的中國抗議日軍進佔東省後、復扣留我國鹽稅我國代表於十一月三日曾至書行政院抗議、該院主席據此旋於十月五日致書日代表嚴重質問、以爲扣留鹽稅與日僑生命財產的安全毫無關係、日本這種行爲、殊不能令人了解日代表於十月五日答復行政院主席、否認其事、但十一月九日施代表復公佈國内來電說截至十一月七日止牛莊鹽稅被扣留的有六十萬元、長春鹽稅被扣留的有二千六百萬元、並由九月十八日起日本軍事長官已禁止各處稅關繳交鹽稅於國民政府過後數日、日代表致書行政院主席、祗說扣留關稅是由於地方政府所要求、而稅欵亦用於該地方上、第三時期（十一月五日至十二月十日）</p>
<p>甲·行政院在巴黎集會的經過　　（一）在巴黎開會的原因這次行政院不在日内瓦而在巴黎開會其原因傳說不一、而其最大的原因、是法國下議院於十一月十二日召集、行政院主席白里安氏以身爲法國外交部長又爲下議院議員、須於該星期内出席議院、以便答復各議員對於法國外交政策的質問又以白里安年邁不堪旅行的勞苦旣不便赴日内瓦、更不能在日内瓦久留故與行政院各委員决定是屆會議於十一月十六日在巴黎外交部大廳舉行、名爲第六十五屆第十七次會議即所以繼續十月的會議、</p>
<p>（二）行政院與美國的合作行政院前次在日内瓦開會時、美國雖曾派員列席然所派者不過是一總領事、以與英法意三外長并肩而坐、論者多譏其無禮、美政府之所以如此、實有不得已的苦衷、因美國人民向主不干涉歐洲政治、及反對國聯、今美政府毅然派員列席國聯最重要的政治機關極可以促成與國聯的積極合作、而至有加入國聯的趨勢若派大員足以惹起國人的注意故祗派一總領事爲代表、以减輕國内的反對但這次國聯行政院會議决在巴黎舉行英法外長亦親自出馬故美國不得不派大員列席、一則就地位說易與英法外長直接談判、一則就外交說易於自出主張、故决以駐英大使美國副總統竇父將軍爲代表、</p>
<p>說到竇父將軍地位、具副總統及大使說到他的說政治勢力則有參議院一部份議員爲後盾現在做列席代表當然是非常適當但可惜美國不是國際聯盟會員其參加行政院的討論、只限於非戰公約有關的問題發言的範圍旣有所限制、所以實際上其地位不能與行政院各委員的地位平等、又因竇父將軍是美國的副總統、若使列席行政院、在精神上對於國聯行動要使美國負有極大的責任有此二大原因、故美政府祗令竇父將軍作非正式參加意見、而不列席於行政院的會議（未完、）</p>

<h3>無畏之中國人</h3>
<p>— 魯顰</p>
<p>四五年前。法京巴黎各報。曾刋一驚人消息。謂有一華人。在法學習航空。一人獨駛一機。作練習之飛行。不意機壞自墮。自數千尺下落。觸於近郊電線。當時飛機全遭焚燬。而此中華之飛人。在機將觸電線時。突自機内躍出。略受微傷。竟免於難。報館記者對於此新聞。除詳細叙述外。并標題日「無長之中國人」。登於顯明地位。今年此無畏之中國人。却又在萬目睽睽之上海抗日戰中。屢建奇勛。從茲無畏精神。益復發揚光大。蓋所謂無畏之中國人者。即我在閘北首先抗日在吳淞死守不退之十九路軍一五六旅旅長翁照垣騰輝將軍是也。運籌决策指揮若定。沉勇之精神。又豈偶然得之哉。</p>
<p>我聽說馬占山降日。悲憤交集。便將他的造像包裹起來。朿之高閣。前幾天聽說他出兵截斷農安義勇軍歸路我益發悲憤交集。便召集了兒女。宣布他的罪狀。將　那像檢出來。猛擲在地上。打成粉碎。昨天忽得他的反正消息。我便由悲憤而變爲驚喜。如果屬實。我願意再辦他的造像仍將香花供奉他仍稱他一聲大中華民國的英雄。</p>

<h3>滬戰與軍器（五）</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>自去年滿洲事變以至上海戰爭。日軍又用三八式重機關槍。因爲我軍也有同樣的軍器。所以敵始終不得逞。反爲我軍掃射。犧牲得很大。第二種輕機關槍。起源於一八九六年。係丹麥人麥特生所創造的。至一九○五年。美國又發明了路易司式輕機關槍。於是遂爲今日各國所採用。日本又把路易司式加以改良裝置。造成一種十一年式輕機關槍。其他還有航空機用機關槍。坦克車用機關槍。高射機關槍等。式樣極多。裝備數量的增加。瞄準眼鏡的精確。射擊指揮的活動。實爲步騎兵不可缺少的戰具。</p>
<p>砲石砲起源於我國。或謂創自秦漢。又說起自元朝。因爲代遠年湮。已無從查考。惟元時確有一種製抬砲。重五六百斤。砲身長五六尺裝置火藥硫磺與拳大的石彈。以爲發射。砲頸的上面。有一引火洞。名呌龍頭。引火洞内。通以藥線。（與現今竹用的藥線相類）藥線着火。彈藥即轟然出口。這種鐵砲。明清兩代最爲通用。一三三九年英法戰爭。時英軍有火砲Ordqnco二十門。每日可發鉛彈二百零四個。法軍受其脅迫。大爲狼狽。這種砲的砲身都是鑄鐵所造。往往因藥力太猛。砲身炸裂傷人。蘇格蘭王約翰二世。即因砲身破裂。死於陣中。後來發明了青銅砲。清道光年間。有葡萄牙人到澳門。他曾帶了四五尊此爲我國洋砲進口的起源。洪秀全起義。即用此砲。百戰百勝。</p>

<p>梁笑雲猛一抬頭。就笑吟吟的說道。好極啦。你今天總算是還肯聽我的話。來得還快。魏卓謀也忙將書本子一掩。扮了個鬼臉兒笑說道。罷了你一來。今天這個課又不用上了安玉田裝着没聽見只把個金盒子　出來揑没在手心裹向梁笑雲道。你昨晚失落了一樣東西在我那裹。你曉得不。梁笑雲搖搖頭道。我不曉得呢。安玉田道。那麽。你猜一猜。看究是什麽東西。梁笑雲微笑道。誰有那麽多的工夫來猜這個。横竪我不會有什要緊東西遺失在你那兒的。安玉田見伊對此并不發生興味。就率直的將那金盒子遞過去道。便是這個。言下。幾乎想順口說出。爲了這點小東西。害得我受了一塲大窘。可是又陡想起這李問霞二字。究竟不使奉告。就又急忙的把口沬咽住。誰知梁笑雲落大方。任憑安玉田將那金盒子送到書桌上平放着。旣不伸手來接。也不正眼一覷。還冷笑着道閙了半天。却只是這個小盒兒。這也値得大驚小怪嗎。我從昨晚回來到如今壓根兒就没打開我那小手提包檢點過。就有點把小東西丢落在你那裹誰還怕你吃没起來不還給我嗎。說罷。不禁嫣然一笑。百媚俱生。安玉田没法子陪着伊傻笑了一陣旋即呆頭　腦的找了一張椅子坐下。現出那種悶悶不樂的神氣來只口　口呆的望着伊二人燜聲不響梁。笑雲正看着有點怪異。魏卓謀却早已開了口道怎麽又　了塲　朋友。我看你今天有很重的心事吧。不如就演一齣坐宫也　密斯梁來　　你的心事。我還可以扮一個奇醜的宫女。夾在裹面胡攪呢安玉　他同　了心將又因魏卓謀究是同鄉素知道他的家事就忿忿地　出那個信來交與魏卓謀　你瞧。這就是家叔安大奎回我的信眞虧他那樣能昧着住良心　　　　　　　　　　完全是他個人的產業并没有我家的股分趁火打刦投　下　　　　　　人大甚了。</p>

<p>谈言</p>
<h3>乞靈扶鸞瑞</h3>
<p>曾憶吾友去年十一月初，在某壇扶鸞，守壇者爲明季陳仲醇，一日降壇云·「從東北來，烏烟障氣，充塞天地，人民刧運未了，恐不轉瞬將延大江南北，諸弟子宜修省，」</p>
<p>當時在社的一般信弟子，多認爲普通訓話，並不十分注意，乃正月初，陳眞人又降鸞，諸弟子以戰事緊張，紛紛叩問此事，眞人答云，</p>
<p>「余於去年某日，曾略示機宜，諸弟子尚能記憶否，」</p>
<p>衆人檢示，乃相顧腭然，蓋眞人早已宣示，戰事將及於大江南北也，於是相與羅拜，叩求禳災，眞人乃召集上海城隍秦景容，寳山城隍王陽明，並拜請關聖帝君，岳武穆王，明戚繼光，清陳化成兩將軍，援助十九路軍，肅清敵人，諸弟子聞訊之餘，莫不欣欣然色喜，因眞人所請諸神，均係前朝赫赫有名之大將，生前事業彪炳，聲施爛然，定能掃蕩敵人，消弭後患顧又不然，眞人又日，</p>
<p>「方今刧運未已，諸弟子因行善免刧者不少，芸芸衆生，尚難已也，」然則敵人未能立即撲滅，</p>
<p>亦有數存焉爾·</p>
<p>我看見以上這種事實，便發生兩種感想，</p>
<p>第一種感想，眞人云，人民刧運未了，恐不轉瞬將延大江南北，後來果然，且所請禦禍諸將，又係歷朝宿將·適與事實完全相符，</p>
<p>第二種感想，旣經神明有靈，何以請到諸位大將，而未見若何成績，乃云方今刧運未已，芸芸衆生，尚難已也從以上兩點觀之，所謂眞人者，僅有先知之明·並無禦禍能力，於此可見，猶如我國处日本侵佔東省後，當局即持不抵抗主義，其惟一泰山之靠，即乞靈於國聯，其事適與此相同·</p>
<p>乞焔憐於眞人靈乎？，日靈矣，戰禍果遍於大江南北也，戚繼光陳化成輩諸名將，果然請到也，不能謂之不靈，然而其效力如何？，</p>
<p>乞憐於眞人靈乎？，日靈矣，大會果開成矣，决議案果公佈矣，謂之不靈，眞是寃枉，然而其效力如何？，</p>
<p>我故日乞靈於國聯無異乞靈於扶鸞</p>

<h3>滬難新樂府夢苕主</h3>
<p>漢·奸·謠·</p>
<p>敵兵欲來，漢好放火，敵兵旣來，迎之道左，敵來猶可，漢奸殺我，嗟汝亦人，豈無肝腸，奈何甘心，爲虎作倀，虎倀聞言，大笑不住，平時我身，千恨誰訴，人生我車，我爲馬牛，人居華　，我棲隘湫，一朝時來，翻轉乾坤，</p>
<p>掦眉吐氣，無佛稱尊，東家黃金，西家美女，女抱我眠，金恣我取，汝莫快意一時，鳥盡弓藏悔且遲，卡·車·行·</p>
<p>卡車兀兀行復停·銅床柚几堆零星，路逢相識人，勸言不可行，前行虎口萬難過，欲過處口囊須傾，卜居舊在浜北地，一朝戎馬倉皇避，夜半轟雷四壁搖，萬屋烟騰赤熛帝，脫身虎窟幸已多，身外有物何暇計，戰後還家心骨驚，十家九破餘焦楹，家具如山獨未失，一一標識題分明，（某君亂後返閘北家中諸物皆未動但編成號碼於此見十九路軍紀律之佳）空車浜北來，滿載浜南去，邏卒逢無數，喝車停當路，有錢放汝行，無錢車且住，多金饋賊車其前，百步之中幾行賂，不論貧富千取百，賂金高於車中値，更有奸民狐假威，倒篋翻箱去無迹，車聲轔轔漸過橋，行人猶唱康衢謠，洪南天地寛如此，人車得到空如水，車轔轔，難爲聽，</p>
<h3>春恨柱尊</h3>
<p>才來春來春又深。千紅萬紫只傷心。無情最是江南柳。不把長條繫陸沉。</p>

<p>大衆科学</p>
<h3>雷是什麽允釐</h3>
<p>電分爲兩種一種是正電俗名陽電，一種是負電，俗名陰電。這兩種電有一種特别的性質：「同性相斥·異性相吸。」就是說：陽電和陽電相遇，或是陰電和陰電相遇，便互相排斥。若是陰電和陽電相遇，便發生極大的愛力互相吸引起來。</p>
<p>地裹和雲裹，都含有巨大的陰陽電。這兩種電不是我們肉眼所能看得見的。到了牠相接觸的時候，便發出一種很大的聲音和着閃閃的電光，所以我們才認識是牠的工作。但是一般無科學常識的人，迷信這閃電是天上的一位雷神，用來穀世間極兇大惡的壞人，以警戒世人。</p>
<p>其實那裹有雷神呢？但是要明瞭，地裹和雲裹，都含有不同的陰陽電，在含電量較少壓力較低的時候，中間有空氣隔絕，所以兩邊的陰陽電不能自由互相吸引。若到了電量很足壓力很高的時候，這兩種不同的電，便互相吸引，就是兩個很大的力互相衝撞，二者之間的空氣，受了猛烈的振盪，便發出那很大的聲音，就是我們所謂之雷。由這樣看來，是空中放電時所成的聲音，並不是另外的一種什麽東西。假若地面上的人成是畜牲，恰巧碰着這種閃電經過的地方，勢必要被牠震死的，若有屋宇樹木夾在其間，勢必要被牠炸毀的。</p>
<p>空中旣然有電，何以能夠證明呢？在西層一七五二年美國有位科學家弗蘭克林）BoojaminFraoklin（曾經作了一個試騐：就是在雷雨大作的時候，他把一個風箏放到空中，風筝的頂上挿一根銅針，麻繩的下端繫一個銅鑰匙，鑰匙的下面聯接絲絹，絲絹的牠端纏在樹上。等到麻繩被雨濕之後，便能傳電。所以風筝頂上的銅針。一經感了雲中的電，便由麻繩傳到鑰匙上。弗蘭克林另外用一根導綫，一端挿在地中，他端和鑰匙相聯接，便發出燦爛的火來，由此可以證明空中是有電的了。</p>
<p>空中放電時，通常我們何以先見閃光而後聞雷聲呢？這是因爲聲在空氣中的速度，每秒間331粎，光的速度，每秒間300000000粎。換句話說，就是光速比音速每間約大百萬倍。所以光和聲同</p>
<p>時發出，一定是光先達到我們的眼球，然後聲才達到我們的耳鼓。</p>
<p>雷聲何以轟轟不怒呢？這是因爲空中放電時，遇了高山，雲，雨地面等的障礙物。而這些障碍物各有不同的位置以致各處反折的回聲同時不能達　於聽者之耳，乃有先後的次序，所以成爲連續不斷的轟轟的雷聲。</p>

<h3>守財虜澄源</h3>
<p>「好好的極樂世界的上海，無端的會戰雲密佈了，正是意想不到的事呢，况且和東洋人打仗，又不同内戰的軍閥，金錢可以運動的，想了又想，究竟怎樣的辦才對呢？</p>
<h3>丑寅卯</h3>
<p>「事兒越弄越糟了，前天接房客的來信，說房租要求减去一些，如果我就允許他們的話，對於我的進益受了相當的打擊了，還是堅持到底吧·」</p>
<p>「閘北的瓦爍裹，我見了比較任何一個人來得傷心些，因爲是我辛辛苦苦的在某行當買辦賺來的金鎊所造成的啊！一二八如果十九路軍不抵抗的話，其他不要說起，單就三個月收來的房租又可以建築一座大洋房了，唉！「幸運得很這次的中日大戰没」</p>
<p>有損失我的資產的分毫，因爲我的地皮，完全在英租界啊！昨天看見報上載着舞臺開鑼了，内容的精采，比較戰前更加來得道地些·今晚我决定伴同三姨太太去賞鑒賞鑒·開開我們的眼界才是！」</p>
<h3>逃難無·朋·</h3>
<p>第一幕：開幕後，舞臺黑暗。逃難者噪雜之聲可聞。</p>
<p>字幕）Titla（：一九三二年一月二十八日上午·上海·閘北。（旋滅）</p>
<p>「轟　！」突然一聲砲響，黑暗中火花四濺。舞臺漸漸發亮，呈灰暗色。此時多數難民由臺後擁出，男男女女，老老小小，哭着喊着横衝直撞。「咯咯咯咯······突然機槍怒吼，</p>
<p>舞臺驟暗。</p>
<p>第二幕：開幕後，一身白衣的紅十字會救護員，提着一大籃饅頭餅乾之類的食物，在難民業中跑來跑去。舞臺突暗，現出字幕：上海第十五難民收容所。一九三二年，三月二日，我軍因變更戰略，退出閘北。（旋滅）此時一賣報的喊着：「唉！時報號外來哉！唉！要看到十九遂軍退出閘北來哉！」</p>
<p>聲調急促而悲切。「啊！！！閘北完了！」難民突然一致大喊。舞臺明亮。個個難民舉拳作憤怒狀。（閉幕）</p>
<p>第三幕：開幕後，即映</p>
<p>字幕：停戰聲中的上海街頭。（旋滅）舞臺明亮。臺左角懸「某某世界」三字。西服少爺，高跟小姐，一對對，一雙雙，熙煕攘攘·來往不絕。「某某世界」三字旁，另掛難民求乞的紙條多張。難民跪紙條下。合十向行人求乞。大家不之理。彷彿很忙似的，快步走過。稍頃一巡捕來，用竹槓敲難民頭說：「去去去！！！」舞臺驟暗。映着字幕：閘北居民·房屋盡被日兵焚燬。如今無家可歸，終日求乞街頭。政府若不早爲設法。須知「人到没有辦法生活的時候，他有作一切事情的權利。」</p>

<h3>Criticism of This Year's General Budget</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan, in its 181st meeting on the 9th of this month, passed the general budget for revenue and expenditure for the 20th year. The expenditure items totaled 89.3 million. Among them, military expenditure reached 27.9 million (the original estimate at the secondary level was over 72 million, which almost equaled the total revenue. After the initial reduction by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics to 31 million, it was further reduced by the Central Political Council to the current figure), accounting for more than one-third of the total expenditure. Even party expenses reached 6 million, while political expenses were only 10 million, education and cultural expenses only slightly over 11 million, industrial expenses only slightly over 5 million, transportation expenses only slightly over 3 million, and construction expenses only slightly over 1 million. Judging from the nature of the various expenditure items, unsound expenditure accounts for the largest percentage, while sound expenditure is minimal. In particular, military expenditure is listed at the top. Even party expenses, which should not be borne by the national treasury, have increased to 6 million (4 million in the 17th year). We cannot help but express dissent regarding this kind of budget, which does not conform to modern principles of financial expenditure. In recent years, our country's finances have fallen into a state of bankruptcy. The reason for this outcome is unsound financial expenditure. In other words, it goes against economic principles. The expenditure of national finances should aim at supporting production and cultivating the prosperity of the national economy. However, our country's financial expenditure today not only fails to support production, but even hinders and destroys it. As a result, the national economy is becoming increasingly dilapidated, the people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly impoverished, and national finances are also falling into a state of exhaustion. This is what we should recognize today.</p>
<p>The state supports more than 2 million soldiers, and the local defense and security police of various provinces and counties are not included. Military expenditure is more than 20 million, and local defense expenses, "bandit suppression" expenses, and various disguised military expenses are also not included. The state empties its treasury, and the people are bled dry to support the military. However, what does the army give back to the country and the people, other than opium, bandits, internal strife, and all kinds of violent and arbitrary behaviors? It cannot defend its territory, and it cannot resist insults. The more military expenditure increases, the more the number of troops increases, the wider the scourge of opium spreads, the more bandits there are, and the more prolonged internal strife becomes. Once internal wars break out, transportation is disrupted, and production enterprises go bankrupt. Therefore, our country's army, with the exception of a very small number who can recognize their responsibilities, does not defend the country, but harms it. So, what is the purpose of the huge expenditure of more than 20 million in military expenditure? We believe that if we want to rectify finances and stabilize the country today, we must start with demobilization and reducing military expenditure. Has the disaster of warlords harming the country and the people for the past 20 years not been enough to awaken us?</p>
<p>As for the navy, it is almost as if there is only the expenditure on the navy and no navy itself. Although we have seen several teams of old gunboats anchored in our country's territorial waters, when the Shanghai war broke out this time, Japanese warships drove straight into our harbor, and our navy did not fire a single shot at them, and the Japanese navy did not even attack them. This alone has greatly puzzled our people. The transfer of 11 million of the navy's temporary funds to expand the air force this time is indeed something we approve of. However, we believe that since the reorganization of our country's navy is impossible and expansion is impossible, it would be better to fundamentally abolish it and use the wasted funds for education and industrial construction, which would be more beneficial.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding party expenses, judging from the experiences of various countries around the world, although political parties control national politics, their organizational affairs are regarded as private activities. Party expenses are generally borne by party members privately and do not come from the national treasury. Only in our country do we spend more than 20 million annually on huge military expenditures to support useless soldiers, and also spend more than 6 million on huge party expenses, making some party members rely on the party as a source of food and clothing and as a profession for survival. Party headquarters have become yamen and breeding grounds for bureaucratic politicians. The meaninglessness of this expenditure is almost the same as supporting troops. We now dare to ask the government, based on the principles of financial expenditure, whether it is also necessary to immediately abolish this expenditure. Now it is increasing year by year. What are the reasons for this? Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure are the fundamental principles of reorganizing finances. Judging from the financial budget expenditure for the 20th year, since it neither actively increases revenue nor passively reduces expenditure, how can we expect finances not to move towards bankruptcy day by day?</p>
<p>The Ceasefire Conference Continues Today</p>
<p>In the morning, inspect the troop withdrawal locations; in the afternoon, the formal group reopens negotiations. The Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference was in an extremely serious situation the day before yesterday. The Japanese representative had already expressed his rejection of the compromise solution proposed by the British envoy after repeated revisions. However, after voluntarily convening a meeting, he finally agreed to send a telegram to the government for instructions. The ceasefire conference was once again given a glimmer of hope. This morning, the subcommittee will revisit the withdrawal locations such as Yin Hing, Wusong, Zhabei, and Yinxiang for inspection. At 3:00 p.m., the formal meeting and the subcommittee will be held separately at the same time. It is widely believed that today's meeting between China and Japan has reached the final stage. Whether it will end here will depend on today's situation. However, according to Japanese sources, the general meeting may have to be postponed for one day, which is also possible.</p>
<h3>Group Inspects Today</h3>
<p>The subcommittee went to the troop withdrawal locations for on-site inspection at 2:00 p.m. on the 7th, but due to time constraints, Yin Hing, Zhabei, Yinxiang, and other places were not inspected. Therefore, it was decided that at 9:00 a.m. this morning, representatives from both China and Japan, as well as consultants from neutral countries, would revisit the site for inspection. The Wusong area is also planned to be visited. The key lines of the four areas of troop withdrawal locations have all been stipulated, and a final confirmation must be obtained today so that they can be submitted to the general meeting for discussion and final decision.</p>
<h3>Our Response Has Not Arrived</h3>
<p>Regarding the final revised plan proposed by the British envoy the day before yesterday, our representative, feeling the enthusiasm of the various friendly nations, reluctantly agreed to request instructions from the government. As of last night, no response from the government had been received.</p>
<h3>Today's Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>This afternoon, the formal meeting and the subcommittee meeting will be held separately at the same time. The subcommittee meeting will conduct a final discussion and decision on the locations of the Japanese troop withdrawal. At the same time, the articles will be discussed in detail. The villages and river houses at the troop withdrawal locations must be clearly marked one by one. If the Japanese side raises the issue of stationing troops in the south of the Suzhou River and Pudong again, we will still reject it. The formal meeting will focus on discussing the time issue. If it breaks down again, I am afraid it will be impossible to salvage it.</p>
<h3>Telegram to League of Nations Representative</h3>
<p>The ceasefire conference has reached fourteen sessions. The attitudes of both parties were initially not close. Our representative Guo telegraphed Representative Yan to the effect that the ceasefire conference was held based on the League of Nations resolution of March 4. Now, due to the Japanese side's lack of sincerity, the conference has repeatedly been on the verge of collapse. Today, the League of Nations special meeting has continued to meet. In order to make the various friendly nations understand the situation, Guo telegraphed the proceedings of the ceasefire conference to Representative Yan so that he could submit them to the special meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government's Response</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: The Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have conferred and sent new instructions to the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, agreeing to revise Article 1 of the suggestions proposed by the British Ambassador Lampson.

<h3>Matsuoka Yosuke Returns to Japan</h3>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi's representative, Matsuoka Yosuke, came to China on February 18 and stayed in Shanghai for many days. He returned to Japan on the Nagasaki Maru yesterday morning. Shigemitsu went to see him off and was reportedly given a report on the proceedings of the ceasefire conference.</p>
<h3>Mr. Jiang Zuobin's Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th Special Dispatch: Jiang Zuobin spoke about the Shanghai ceasefire conference, stating that the Japanese side lacks sincerity and the future is quite bleak. Our side is determined that we cannot discuss any political issues until the Japanese army has completely withdrawn. However, the friendly nations are still doing their best to mediate, hoping that they can realize the situation. Our country, in order to respect the League of Nations resolution, has telegraphed the deadlock situation of the conference to the Special Committee, requesting a fair judgment.</p>

<h3>Zhao Yijian and Shen Guanghan Express Resolve</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 10th Special Dispatch: Zhao Yijian published a theory on the 10th about fighting Japan to the end, saying that it is necessary to fight Japan and there is a certainty of victory in the battle. We must not be attached to the illusion of temporary peace and should make a firm determination to recover the lost territory by force, listing six reasons. Shen Guanghan gave instructions to his troops, saying that the brutal Japanese can never be made to withdraw through words and concessions. We should use hot blood to drive back the enemy.</p>
<h3>Japan Falsely Reports to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Japanese troops repeatedly provoked our side and falsely accused our troops of firing on them. Reuters, Geneva, 9th: The Japanese representative to the League of Nations notified Secretary-General Drummond, claiming that on April 7, about 60 Chinese soldiers crossed the Suzhou River north of Jiwangmiao and fired on the Japanese soldiers near Hujia Bang (transliteration). At the same time, a team of Chinese soldiers, also about 60 people, joined the firing, but were repelled by the Japanese soldiers. The Chinese representative notified the Secretary-General of the League of Nations with the remarks of Sir Lytton, Chairman of the Investigating Committee, stating that when Lord Lytton visited Nanjing, he stated to the President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei that maintaining the integrity of Chinese territory and administration should be a condition for the League of Nations to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Oppose Compromise Solutions</h3>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference of various national salvation groups, the Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Groups believes that the three compromise solutions proposed by British Envoy Lampson violate the League of Nations resolution. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the British Envoy requesting his attention. At the same time, they also sent letters to our country's attending representatives Guo Taiqi, Vice Minister, Dai Ji, Commander, and telegraphed to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of Nanjing, Luo Wengan, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, and the National Crisis Conference, etc., asking them not to be misled. The original text of their letters and telegrams is excerpted below:</p>
<h3>Letter to the British Envoy</h3>
<p>Your Excellency, Sir Miles Lampson, British Envoy to China, in this ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference between our country and Japan, we appreciate your hard work in mediating. Our people believe that Article 1 of the compromise solution proposed by you, which states that the Japanese government declares that the Japanese military hopes to completely withdraw within six months when the local situation progresses to ensure safety, violates the spirit of the League of Nations resolution and is of no practical benefit to the future of peace. The phrase "ensure safety of the local situation" has no objective and clear interpretation. What stable state can be regarded as ensuring safety is subject to the unilateral and subjective determination of Japan. Before January 28, there was no unsafe situation in the local area, but Japan unexpectedly began shelling. Today, the Japanese army is stationed in Shanghai with great arrogance, and the people's property and industries in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have been almost completely destroyed. The feelings of pain and resentment are brewing in the minds of the people of Yong</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Secretly Purchases Flour in Shanghai</h3>
<p>For military use or famine relief? Shanghai Qin Wu Shi Bao (newspaper) reports that Soviet Russian representatives recently secretly purchased 586,000 bags of flour from local factories in this port. The goods were delivered a week ago and are currently being shipped to Vladivostok. It is unknown whether this large batch of grain is being transported to grain-deficient areas due to the Soviet Union's poor harvest to provide relief to the people, or whether a portion of it will be transported to the Kamchatka Peninsula fishing area as in previous years, or whether it has other uses. Considering that Russian troops are currently concentrated on the Manchurian border, this flour may be stored for military use. It is also heard that Soviet Russian representatives recently purchased another one million bags, but they were unable to collect such a large batch of flour in this port. In the past, Vladivostok often exported large quantities of wheat, but now it is doing the opposite. According to recent news, after a poor harvest in Russia last year, 40 million people are affected. Areas such as the Urals, Western Siberia, the middle and lower reaches of the Volga River, Bashkiria, and Northern Caucasus are all experiencing food shortages. Therefore, Russia's activities of dumping grain on foreign markets have been suspended, and Vladivostok has changed from an exporter to an importer.</p>
<h3>Ping-Luo and Shaanxi-Gansu Airmail Services Open Successively</h3>
<p>Shanghai Post Office news on April 5th and 13th: The Eurasia Aviation Company's Ping-Luo route and the Shaanxi-Gansu route are scheduled to open on April 5th and 13th respectively, with one round trip each week. That is, every Tuesday, it will fly from Beiping to Luoyang, and return from Luo to Ping on Friday. Also, every Wednesday, it will fly from Chang'an (Xi'an) to Gaolan (Lanzhou), and return from Gaolan to Chang'an on Thursday. The above two routes will be connected to the company's Jing-Shaanxi route and the China Aviation Corporation's Hu-Yu route. All mail sent to various locations along the route and transferred through various places can be accepted for air transport. The prices of airmail can be inquired at various post offices. In addition, airmail sent to Beiping is sealed and sent at the Administration at 12:30 p.m. every Thursday, and airmail sent to Gaolan is sealed and sent at 12:30 p.m. every Tuesday.</p>
<p>Minister Chen Fumu Discusses</p>
<h3>Reasons for Increasing Postal Rates</h3>
<p>To make up for deficits and develop postal services, the Ministry of Communications has decided to implement the postal rate increase next month, and the Directorate General of Posts has also been ordered to prepare all the procedures. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency visited Minister Chen Fumu of the Ministry of Communications yesterday to inquire about the progress. According to him, increasing postal rates is something that must be done at present. The reasons for the increase are: ㈠ To make up for deficits ㈡ To develop postal services. According to the recent report of the Directorate General of Posts, the estimated difference between income and expenditure for the 21st year is 9,918,700 yuan. The postal deficit this year is due to natural disasters and foreign troubles, and the decrease in income is one reason. At the same time, the increase in expenditure is also an important reason for the increase in postal expenditure. 甲 is for postal transportation costs. The expenditure on postal transportation costs in the 16th year was 4,448,322 yuan, while the expenditure in the 19th year increased to 9,528,594 yuan, an increase of more than 5 million, or 70 percent, in three years. Although there has been no settlement for the 20th year, there is no doubt that there will still be an increase compared to the 19th year. This increase in transportation costs is not only for international mail, but also for domestic mail in China, such as the three northeastern provinces and Yunnan, which must be transported through Hong Kong, Annam, and Japan by railway and ship, and the transportation costs are the same as for foreign mail. Even within the inland provinces, due to high living costs in various places, labor, livestock transportation costs, and the high cost of gasoline on postal routes with automobiles, the increase is also significant. 乙 is for salary increases for postal workers. The annual expenditure on salaries for postal workers has increased by more than one million yuan. For example, the increase in the 18th year was 1,373,137 yuan compared to the 17th year, and the increase in the 19th year was another 1,649,317 yuan. This increase is incremental, and the increase in the 20th and 21st years will definitely be greater. The expenditure in the 18th year has increased by several million compared to now. 丙 is for the increase in the printing costs of stamps and the purchase price of postal supplies. The expenditure in the 16th year was 1,213,664 yuan, and the expenditure in the 19th year was 1,426,429 yuan, an increase of more than 200,000 yuan. The huge increase in this expenditure would not be a problem if postal services were developed. However, due to years of internal wars, natural disasters, and foreign troubles, postal income has not increased, but has greatly decreased, resulting in the current situation of bankruptcy. In the past few years, there have been repeated losses, all of which have been subsidized by the surplus of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. For example, last year's loss was about 5 million, which was compensated for by the fact that the Remittance Bureau had a surplus of about 5 million. This year, due to the current situation and financial panic, although the Bureau's budget still has a surplus of 2 to 3 million, it will definitely not be able to make up for the huge postal deficit of more than 9 million. This is one reason why postal rates must be increased to make up for the postal deficit. Secondly, in order to develop postal services, postal facilities must be complete and delivery must be rapid, and then the people will be happy to use them. Postal facilities are still extremely crude in many places. For example, in places with waterways, small motorboats could be used to transport mail, but manual rowing boats are still used. Automobiles and bicycles could be used for delivery, but foot delivery is still used. Also, many towns and markets have no postal service, and even if there are postal agencies, the facilities are extremely poor. In the past, the policy was not to seek improvement or promotion in order to reduce expenses and accommodate the current economic situation of the post office. This is a mistake. Also, there are still one or two ignorant people who oppose airmail delivery, pointing out that it increases postal expenditure and causes postal deficits, and arguing that expenses should not be paid under the postal item. They do not know that airmail delivery and the development of postal services are one and the same and cannot be separated. If airmail delivery can also be opposed, then it is the same as arguing that mail on land should only be delivered on foot and water transport should only be carried out by sailboats, and opposing the use of automobiles and ships for transportation. Moreover, China has a vast territory, opening up border provinces and hinterland areas, and S transportation is inconvenient. Railways and highways cannot be built overnight. Air transport makes it convenient for information to flow between the hinterland and border provinces, and is also a key to promoting China's unification. Therefore, it is necessary to subsidize certain expenses every year. This is the second reason for increasing postal rates to develop postal transport. Some people also mistakenly believe that it is not appropriate to increase the burden on the people during this time of foreign troubles and natural disasters. This is a misunderstanding. Postal services are completely of the nature of labor and agency, and are completely different from the nature of so-called donations and taxes. If the funds for labor and agency are insufficient to pay, they should be increased. At present, if postal rates are not to be increased, there are only two methods: first, reduce postal expenses, lay off employees and reduce salaries; second, the national treasury should provide subsidies. According to the first method, postal administration will not only not develop, but will also regress, and layoffs and salary reductions are also not something that most employees are willing to do. According to the second method, not only is the national treasury extremely difficult and unable to provide subsidies, but even if it is able to provide subsidies, the result will only truly become an increase in the burden on the people. The national treasury's income comes from donations and taxes, and the majority of the burden of donations and taxes is borne by the majority of poor people, while the people who use postal services the most are not the majority of poor people, but the wealthier merchants and urban residents with assets. Now, if donations and taxes are drawn from the majority of poor people to subsidize postal services, which are used the most by a small number of wealthy people, this is not only not an appropriate policy, but it is also inconsistent with the principles of national economic finance. According to the survey statistics of the post office, postal rates in China are now lower than in various countries. If the money for labor is insufficient, a slight increase will not be considered an increase in the burden on the people. For example, some people argue that newspapers and books should not be increased because they are related to publicity and culture. This may be true, but there are also things that should be told to society. Newspaper postage rates have been reduced repeatedly since the Republic of China. It is now estimated that the post office has to lose 3 yuan and 1 jiao and 6 fen in transportation costs for every 10 kilograms of newspapers sent, totaling hundreds of thousands of yuan in transportation costs alone each year, not to mention other costs. As for books and printed matter, their composition is bulky, and coupled with the inconvenience of inland transportation, the losses are even greater. It is estimated that the post office loses about 3 million yuan annually in transportation costs for both items, and these mails, except for newspapers, are not necessarily related to culture. According to statistics, most of the books are novels, and most of the novels are superstitious and obscene novels that hinder culture. It is also unreasonable for the post office to lose huge sums of money every year to transmit these superstitious and obscene novels that hinder culture and to give unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to profit from books that have no morality. The current method of slightly increasing postage rates based on the weight is actually a helpless thing. In short, the postal rate increase was presented to the Executive Yuan for implementation after detailed research and discussion by Minister Chen and the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications, and was not handled rashly. In addition, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Postal Savings Bureau and the Directorate General of Posts to</p>
<p>strictly reduce their expenses, and also plans to appropriately limit salary increases for post office employees,</p>
<p>so as to ensure that after this increase, there will be no further increase in rates due to insufficient income and expenditure.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Aircraft Demonstrated Again Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 p.m. yesterday, another large number of Japanese aircraft, totaling 29, first had nine aircraft divided into three teams, each team of three, circling in various places in Zhabei. Then there were 20 aircraft, divided into three teams: the first team of seven, the second team of eight, and the third team of five. All flew from the Pudong area to the French Concession, passed through the Public Concession to Zhabei, and circled once. Twelve aircraft were seen returning to the east of Pudong, and the rest flew to the mouth of the Yangtze River and the Yangtze River area, and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Japanese Marines</p>
<h3>Two Battalions Scheduled to Return Home Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the third and fourth battalions of the Japanese Marines, which came to Shanghai at the end of January, are now scheduled to leave Shanghai on two transport ships at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow (11th) to return home.</p>
<p>Coastal Radio Station</p>
<h3>Ship Communication Remains the Same</h3>
<p>According to news from the Wusong Coastal Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, the station operated as usual after the Japanese army launched the January 28th Incident. On February 1st, it received a notice from the Wusong Fortress Command stating that the station's antenna tower was a target for Japanese military bombardment and requested that it be dismantled immediately. At the same time, it also received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, ordering it to dismantle the overhead dedicated wires connecting Shanghai and Wusong. At this time, they were also burned and cut off. All the personnel of the Songtai lost the center of their work at this point, so on February 2nd, they carried important components and returned to Shanghai. On the same day, they borrowed the Ning Shao merchant ship to maintain communication, and obtained the consent of Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company to install a transmitter in the company and immediately resume the business of ship communication. Currently, because the antenna position of the machine is not good and the transmission distance is not far, a newly purchased 1,500-watt transmitter has been installed properly. The two machines work at the same time, and a receiving and transmitting office is attached to the International Radio Station of the Sassoon Building. They are working hard for ship communication and maritime safety. The outside world falsely claims that the staff fled when the Shanghai incident occurred, and that it is now being handled by another station. All of these are fabricated.</p>
<h3>Hu Zongduo Telegraphs His Resignation as Staff Officer of the Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>Hu Zongduo, the former Hubei Bandit Suppression Supervisor, was recently appointed as a senior staff officer by the Military Affairs Commission. Mr. Hu is recuperating in Shanghai and has not yet recovered. Yesterday, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang to resign. The telegram reads as follows: Nanjing, Chairman Chiang Jianzhong, I am deeply honored and terrified to receive your order. I originally intended to report for duty immediately to serve you. However, I have been in the military for a long time and have accumulated deep-rooted illnesses. I have not recovered from treatment and cannot bear the important entrustment. In addition to sending a staff member to return the order, I hereby telegraph my sincere request to withdraw my appointment and select someone more virtuous and capable. I am deeply grateful. Hu Zongduo kowtows.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Marked the Anniversary of Hu Liseng's Death</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th) was the seventh anniversary of the death of Hu Liseng, the former Henan Governor. Initiated by Zhang Qun, Li Genyuan, Chen Zhishuo, Sun Baochun, Yin Ruli, etc., the memorial service was held at Wusheng Zen Temple on Mengdelan Road as in previous years. Mr. Chen Zhishuo first sent someone to prepare. Around 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the same day, about 50 or 60 people attended the meeting, which was quite a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>Shangguan Yunxiang's Representative Hosts Various Circles</h3>
<p>Shangguan Yunxiang, the General Commander of the Third Route Army of the Suppressing Communists Army and concurrently the Commander of the 47th Division, dispatched the Chief of Staff of the said army, Li Genyun, to Shanghai to liaise and connect with various groups. At 6 PM the day before yesterday, a banquet was held at the Dahua Hotel, inviting more than 60 people from various circles in Shanghai, hosted by Mr. Li. He also delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Commander Shangguan, and reported on the unit's battles and details of suppressing the communists over the past few years, as well as the process of volunteering to participate in the anti-Japanese aid to Shanghai. After speaking, he toasted all the guests on behalf of Commander Shangguan, and the guests returned the toast. The gathering ended happily at 9 PM. It is reported that Mr. Li Genyun once served as the commander of the 46th Division of the National Revolutionary Army and was a brave general in the Suppressing Communists Army.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department to Hold Party Purification Commemoration Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department will convene a Party Purification Commemoration Meeting in the auditorium on the third floor at 9 AM tomorrow (the 12th). Prior to the event, letters were sent to various institutions and groups requesting them to nominate representatives, and all party members in the city were ordered to attend. It is said that Tong Xingbai has been appointed as the chairman, and Zhou Feicheng and Chen Kecheng will give speeches.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Committee Presents Opinions to the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Rent Reduction Movement Committee, regarding the issue of rent reduction, after various sectors successively proposed opinions, has compiled and reviewed them. A roughly concrete plan has been prepared and can be determined. However, considering that it concerns the interests of all citizens of this city, it is necessary to proceed cautiously. Therefore, it is planned to convene a representative assembly of various groups at a fixed date, so as to gather collective wisdom and establish a common standard, so that citizens have something to follow and achieve the purpose of rent reduction. Yesterday, letters were sent to various groups requesting them to nominate representatives so that a representative assembly could be convened on a fixed date, and personnel were dispatched to present opinions to the Social Affairs Bureau. The details of the various situations are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3>Notice to Nominate Representatives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the association notified various groups, stating: "Respectfully, after reviewing the sixth executive committee meeting of this association, it was decided to hold a representative assembly on a fixed date. The representatives that each group should nominate must report before April 14th, but each group shall not have more than two representatives. We are notifying you accordingly, and hope you will investigate and handle accordingly. Respectfully addressed to all groups, Shanghai Citizens Rent Reduction Movement Committee. Furthermore, because the original address of the association is insufficient for office use, it was moved yesterday to the fourth floor of No. 251 Zhifu Road, at the mouth of Touqiao, where work will continue as usual."</p>
<h3>Dispatching Personnel to Present Opinions</h3>
<p>Previously, due to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau drafting rent reduction measures, considering the importance of the matter, the association appointed five committee members, namely Yu Hualong, Cao Zhigong, Wang Manyun, Sun Mingqi, and Zhang Yiqing, to petition the Social Affairs Bureau at 10 AM the day before yesterday. The director of the bureau, Mai Chaochu, and the chief of the fourth section came out to meet them. After the representatives presented their opinions, they replied that the Social Affairs Bureau is currently only planning to divide the area into regions and differentiate between residents and shops. As for the rent reduction method, after the municipal government issues instructions, a special committee will be organized to plan in detail, and responsible personnel from your association will be invited to discuss together, so as to avoid misunderstandings and facilitate implementation. The representatives then said that they hoped that the government would consider the interests of the majority of citizens and not think of preserving the private interests of a very small number of pleasure-seeking landlords. Director Mai and Chief Zhang agreed to accept this. The representatives then took their leave and departed.</p>

<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Committee's Letter to the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Advocating that donations, taxes, water, and electricity not be reduced. The rent reduction committees of various groups in the French Concession sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, stating: "Respectfully, since the unfortunate incident between China and Japan occurred in Shanghai, the citizens have felt the pain. Our businessmen and residents in the French Concession have enjoyed the intentional protection of your Municipal Council, ensuring the security of the concession and guaranteeing the peace and prosperity of the citizens. The contributions have been remarkable, and the citizens have benefited greatly. Therefore, the relationship between the Chinese and French people has become even more harmonious. However, the residents of Shanghai have been affected by the war, resulting in business suspensions for two months, and the number of unemployed common people and workers is everywhere. Although the city's shops have reluctantly reopened now, business is sparse, and the social economy has suffered a huge blow. Therefore, to seek economic adjustment and prosperity, it is impossible without reducing the burden on the citizens. Therefore, the city's commercial groups and people from all walks of life have launched a rent reduction movement, which is truly the only good method to relieve the suffering of the people, develop commerce, maintain the livelihood of common people, and protect local governance. However, the situation in our French Concession is slightly different from that in the nearby war zones. Although it is not directly affected by the war, it has indirectly suffered from social economic insecurity and commercial decline, which is difficult to describe. Therefore, the proposition of rent reduction is truly a expression of the same heart and the same reason among the people of this city. Therefore, the purpose of our association is to investigate the circumstances of all parties to see whether or not rent should be reduced, or whether there is a need for rent reduction, so as to conduct detailed examination, open research, and serious consideration, and to persuade landlords and tenants to resolve the matter peacefully and impartially. Upon investigation, the French Consulate General and the former French Mixed Court also recognized that landlords arbitrarily increased rents and imposed heavy pressure, resulting in frequent disputes. Therefore, in October 1921, a notice was issued to strictly prohibit it. However, over time, people have become negligent. Those who speak are earnest, but those who listen are indifferent. In addition to sending another letter to the French Consul General requesting him to reiterate the previous order to alleviate the people's difficulties, the reason why landlords are so unscrupulous is entirely due to the one piece of paper issued by your Municipal Council, which is enough to control the fate of tenants and achieve their desire to coerce rent increases. Otherwise, they would use the excuse of renovation to force tenants to move out, and disputes over oppression of tenants would also arise. Hereafter, the Engineering Department of your Municipal Council should carefully consider and investigate whether or not to issue permits to landlords when they apply for permits, and verify whether the renovation of the house has reached the specified time limit before approving it. Because there are some landlords who, even if the houses are not newly built, only ten or eight years old, use the excuse of renovation to force tenants to move out, resulting in only slight repairs, to arbitrarily extort small rents and huge rent increases. Our association sincerely requests your Municipal Council to effectively ban this immoral behavior of landlords obtaining permits on behalf of the citizens of the French Concession. As for the issue of rent reduction, if it is implemented, we are afraid that it will affect the income of your Municipal Council. Our association dares to solemnly declare that if landlords and tenants implement rent reduction, all taxes, donations, water, electricity, and other expenses payable to your Municipal Council will be handled in accordance with the regulations, without any reduction, so as to maintain each other, so as to avoid misunderstandings and show understanding. As for the members of our association, they are all good businessmen and residents in this concession. The purpose of organizing this association is purely to quell disputes and mediate between parties, and we will not inquire about other issues. This is also something that should be solemnly declared. We specially list the reasons for rent reduction, the purpose, and the implementation guidelines, and respectfully request your Municipal Council to understand the situation and earnestly examine and implement it. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Director of the French Municipal Council, Wei Fa.</p>
<p>Rent Reduction Committees of various groups in the French Concession, the French Concession Commercial Federation, Nanyang Bridge, Caishi Street, Minguo Road, Avenue Edward VII, Tangjiawan, West District New West District, Xujiahui, and other commercial federations on various roads, the French Concession Warehouse Industry Federation, etc., jointly started on April 9th.</p>
<h3>Zheng Yuxiu Departs Overseas Today</h3>
<p>Dr. Zheng Yuxiu previously exerted her best efforts for the country as a national representative at the Paris Peace Conference, and her achievements are obvious. When the Mukden Incident arose, reports and telegrams from abroad flew in, and the private telegram fees were enormous. Now, she is going overseas again to France, Britain, and the United States to work on national diplomacy. She is scheduled to depart today and will take about three or four months to return.</p>
<h3>New County Seat's Land Leased for Grain Planting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government moved its seat to Beiqiao, and the required land has been purchased with funds and construction is being planned. However, due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War, it has been delayed. It is now understood that the County Farmers' Education Center has requested to temporarily lease the 50 to 60 mu of land purchased by the county seat for cultivating grain, as it is currently the spring plowing season, and it would be a pity to leave it barren. This can greatly increase grain production. Therefore, a report was submitted to the Education Bureau and forwarded to the County Government, requesting a temporary lease for grain cultivation. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Yan deemed the matter feasible and ordered it to be approved yesterday, but instructed the center to submit the cultivation plan for verification.</p>
<p>Redwood Furniture Store</p>
<h3>Huge Bomb Explosion</h3>
<p>Bombs brought down rows of doors and purple sandalwood cabinets. The source of the bombs is unknown. Zhou Liangqing, a 58-year-old man from Wuxi, had his great-grandfather open the Zhou Xiangtai Redwood Furniture Store at No. 45 to 51 Zilai Street in the French Concession a long time ago. Up to Liangqing's generation, the business has had a history of more than 80 years and has been very successful. Eight years ago, because the business was growing daily and the old store was not enough, Zhou opened a double-fronted store at No. 56 to 58 across the street as a branch, named Yitai. The store only had one apprentice, Shen Yansheng, living upstairs to watch over it. At 2:10 AM yesterday morning, the people in the main store suddenly heard a loud explosion across the street, and the buildings shook. Knowing that something had happened, they quickly got up and went out to check. They only saw that the northernmost row of doors of the branch had been completely blown down, thick smoke filled the air, and the smell of medicine was everywhere. At the same time, the apprentice Shen Yansheng was startled and ran downstairs and escaped from the door. After about 20 minutes, the thick smoke began to dissipate, but three purple sandalwood cabinets and redwood tables and chairs were blown up and destroyed. The large partition of the Hongtai Woodware Store opened by the Cai family at No. 52 to 54 next door was also blown down, also destroying a lot of valuable woodware. The branch manager, Li Xizhang, immediately rushed to report to the police station. The police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. After an investigation, it was indeed caused by a large amount of explosives, but the source could not be determined. Fortunately, no one was injured. The branch suffered a loss of more than 2,000 yuan, and the Cai family suffered a loss of about 500 yuan. The police station has collected the bombed fragments and filed them for investigation.</p>
<p>Association Plans to Hold</p>
<h3>Charity Basketball Game</h3>
<p>Raising funds to relieve Shanghai refugees. The champions are scattered and success is not easy. The China National Sports Advancement Association has announced the cessation of all sports in the face of the national crisis. According to a statement from the person in charge of the association, the association plans to hold a charity basketball game in the near future to relieve Shanghai refugees, either by collecting several teams to compete in a series of matches, or by holding a Chinese-Western confrontation match. However, the difficulty is that the champions are currently scattered and it is not easy to gather them. Whether or not it will be successful in the future depends on this.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association's Disaster Relief Rice</h3>
<p>The Standing Director of the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and others, previously, due to the fact that unemployed workers and poor residents along the Pudong coast were unable to survive due to the impact of the war, Mr. Du took on the responsibility of providing relief. Last month, rice was distributed in accordance with the results of the investigation, and two distributions have been completed. However, due to the fact that re-checking and calculating, as well as preparing rice tickets, took some time, the third distribution of rice was slightly delayed. It is now scheduled to be distributed immediately. On the day before yesterday (the 9th), the Spring Relief Committee accounted for more than 665 shi of rice that had been issued, benefiting more than 32,000 people. There were even more poor households in the third distribution than before. Four measures were discussed and resolved: 1. Poor households listed in the investigation forms that have already returned to work should be excluded. 2. Rice tickets will be issued to each household based on the actual population, starting from the 11th of this month. If anyone is found to have returned to work and intentionally inflating the numbers, they will be dealt with. 3. If there are destitute workers and residents who are unable to survive on their own, they may seek the credible certification of two or more merchants and re-investigate. If they are found to be genuine, they may still be included in the next round of relief. 4. The above resolutions should be immediately sent to the Third District General Office of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for public announcement. In addition, those who have enthusiastically donated rice to the disaster relief effort include Mr. Liu Hongsheng, 300 dan of rice; Mr. Li Qing, 50 dan; Jia Fuji, 50 dan; Chen Tingzhang and Chen Xianzhang, 50 dan jointly; Zhang Shangji, 30 dan; Chang Caichen, 10 dan; Zhang Zhiji, 10 dan; China Merchants Bureau Heji, 10 dan. In addition, Mr. Du, the standing director, and others will be responsible for supplementing and distributing it on a regular basis. The main purpose is to temporarily provide relief to those who have lost their jobs due to the war and are unable to support themselves. Therefore, efforts will be made to ensure that the investigation and distribution of rice are accurate and to eliminate fraud in order to achieve the practical benefits of relief.</p>
<h3>National Anti-Drug and National Salvation Corps Urges Trial of the Wu Case</h3>
<p>The National Anti-Drug and National Salvation Corps believes that the case of lawyer Wu Mai has not been heard by the court for a long time. Yesterday, it sent two letters to the Shanghai District Court and the Shanghai Lawyers Association, respectively, as follows: 1. Respectfully, the case of lawyer Wu Mai's lawsuit with the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau is attracting national attention. Since this case has been accepted by your court, we request that the court immediately hold a hearing and render a fair judgment to demonstrate the spirit of the rule of law and to clear the vision of the Chinese people.

Your association's purpose is to uphold justice and protect human rights. Please urge the court to hold a hearing immediately and not delay the matter and cover up the truth. We hope this is the case. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Lawyers Association.</p>
<h3>Southern Fujian Fellow Townsmen Association Cables Request for Investigation and Prosecution of Chen Guohui</h3>
<p>Forcibly planting opium and massacring the people. The Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai received a letter yesterday from various groups in Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Dehua reporting that Chen Guohui was forcing the planting of opium, levying opium seedling donations, and massacring the people. After receiving the report, the association immediately convened a meeting and resolved to cable the central government to stop the investigation and prosecution. A transcript of the original cable is as follows: Chairman of the Nanjing National Government Lin, Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang, President of the Supervisory Yuan Yu, and Minister of Military Affairs He, and the National Anti-Opium Commission. Chen Guohui, the brigade commander of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army, is forcibly planting opium and levying opium seedling donations in Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Dehua. Recently, because the residents of Hui'an opposed it, Chen did not change his bandit nature and sent a team to massacre them. Please quickly order the Fujian Provincial Government to effectively stop it, and request that personnel be dispatched to investigate and prosecute it in order to uphold the law and appease the people. Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on the Gongchao [Labor Dispute] of the Shishi Xinbao [China Times]</h3>
<p>The newspaper delivery union's mediation failed again. The news was released by the newspaper industry union that the labor dispute at the China Times had been ongoing for many days and had not been resolved. The mediation by the three major newspapers and the Social Affairs Bureau had failed. The newspaper's side disregarded social peace and tranquility, which was evident. Yesterday, the mediation by the newspaper delivery union failed again, so the storm has not yet subsided. The news from yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>The newspaper delivery union's mediation failed. After hearing that the China Times authorities and the workers had a dispute, the newspaper delivery union sent representative Zhai Xiaohui to mediate. Mr. Zhai traveled for many days, but the newspaper's side repeatedly delayed and showed no sincerity. Mr. Zhai withdrew from his position as mediator in anger, fearing that the problem would become more and more intractable.</p>
<p>The union refutes the newspaper's public statement. The responsible speaker of the newspaper industry union said that the so-called public statement of the colleagues disclosed in the early edition of the newspaper yesterday (the 10th) concealed the truth and could not be added to it. The impressions and feelings gained from the cunning, vicious, and active on paper were even more non-laughing and non-laughing. We are all filled with grief and anger at the brutal actions of the Japanese throughout the country. The traitors who are used by others are even more insane. Unexpectedly, the newspaper authorities, who claim to save the country and resist Japan, on the one hand, use theoretical arguments on paper against Japan to decorate their facade and win the sympathy of the Social Affairs Bureau, and on the other hand, follow the old practices of the Japanese and inflict our ignorant workers, the puppet government of the Northeast, and the puppet municipal government of Zhabei. The Chinese people are heartbroken and deeply resentful. The former knowingly manipulated and instructed by the Japanese claimed to the international community that they were nationally self-determining. The latter knowingly instructed by the Japanese in secret slandered friendly countries to friendly nations. International friends heal it for social people. The authorities of the newspaper compared to Japanese warlords and puppet traitors, compared to ignorant workers. Social people know this analogy and think more than half of it. In terms of the labor situation, all the facilities of the executive committee have been destroyed. In terms of the union system, the system has been changed to contracting work, and the work has also been increased. The color change of the map of the three northeastern provinces and the sudden change of the market in a corner of Zhabei can be said to be a photographic and deformed public statement of the China Times workers today. It is undoubtedly done by the newspaper on behalf of the newspaper, and the contradictions in the article are numerous. In all these, the newspaper authorities have long been plotting to destroy the union organization, and it is even more obvious that they are using puppet workers and traitors, many and numerous. When jackals are in power, who will ask about foxes? The union is determined to fight the China Times to the end.</p>
<p>The China Times's forced departure from the museum is a declaration of all employees to compatriots from all walks of life and workers from all over the world. Since we have been forced to leave the museum by the evil China Times capitalists, we have struggled and workers from all walks of life have continued to work hard, although our union has done its best and workers from all walks of life have continued to help us, we still cannot get good results, and the pressure is getting more and more fierce. These "civilized" and "knowledgeable" newspaper capitalists are determined to put us to death. Therefore, we can only use all our energy to swear to persist to the death, and tell our sufferings and the situation in the last few days to the compatriots of the whole China. Our newspaper industry union has been established for five years. During these five years, I don't know how many difficulties have been experienced, and it can still exist until now. This huge struggle force is completely due to the unity of all our workers. The capitalists, in order to intensify the oppression and exploitation of us, the only prerequisite task is to destroy our unity. Only by destroying our unity can we begin to implement their policy of oppression and exploitation. This time, the use of force to threaten us to leave the museum by borrowing the Daiyin [Substitute Printing] "Da Wan Bao" incident is the first sound to begin to destroy us. Originally, "Da Wan Bao" does not belong to the rule of our newspaper industry union, and has its own printing workshop. Since its publication, it has not needed others to print it on its behalf. Who knew that these cunning newspaper capitalists knew that the workers who belonged to the newspaper industry union could not work for others at the same time, so they used the Daiyin "Da Wan Bao" incident to destroy us intentionally. When we received the union's order prohibiting Daiyin, the museum immediately forced our workers to withdraw from the newspaper industry union. On the one hand, it took advantage of the fact that Japanese imperialism was attacking Shanghai and unemployment was soaring to hire new workers with lower wages. Therefore, this action not only attempts to destroy our entire union, but also intensifies the exploitation of us. Under this situation, we can only unite firmly and resolutely for our own interests, and swear to uphold our newspaper industry union and oppose these capitalists who take advantage of the fire. It has been a week since the incident. The China Times capitalists, seeing that it is useless to use force to suppress, have gone a step further to universally buy off labor thieves and running dogs, and ordered them to fill out extremely harsh voluntary books under duress and inducement. However, these traitors who see profit and forget righteousness only care about their own interests and disregard the survival of the union account for only a small number. Most of us workers only know how to obey the union's orders and support the union's organization. Under this difficult situation, we are willing to use the last bit of energy to fight to the end with the China Times capitalists. We also hope that our compatriots from all over the country and workers from all over the world will stand on the position of mutual assistance of the oppressed class in order to maintain public morality and justice and give us powerful assistance and give these ferocious capitalists a huge punishment. 'Our conditions are: 1. Immediately apologize to the newspaper industry union in the newspaper, 2. Restore the situation before April 2, A. All employees resume work, B. Guarantee the original conditions and all vested rights, C. Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, D. The museum shall not interfere with the union's administration, 3. Punish those who caused the incident, 4. Compensate all the losses suffered by the union in this incident. Shanghai Newspaper Industry Union China Times Forced to Leave the Museum All Employees, April 9.</p>

As for the chairman of the assembly, Wang Xiaolai was unable to return to Shanghai and telegraphed to request Xu Jiqing to serve as chairman.</p>
<h3>Candidate Selection</h3>
<p>The outgoing board members of the Shanghai Municipal Council from the Ratepayers' Association were Messrs. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, and Liu Hongsheng. Messrs. Hu Mengjia and Liu Hongsheng had indicated their unwillingness to serve on the board again. However, according to public opinion, due to the efforts of Hu and others in past work, such as the waterworks case, and the diligence of all Chinese board members in safeguarding the safety of ratepayers in the concession day and night since the Shanghai Incident, there was a strong desire that Messrs. Hu and Liu not prematurely retire during this time of national crisis. Therefore, there will likely be no significant changes to the board member lineup. The committee members are Messrs. Chen Tingrui, Li Fusun, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Qian Longzhang, and Wu Yunzhai. Mr. Li Fusun had been instrumental in joining the Shanghai Municipal Council Committee in the seventeenth year. Currently, focusing on the soundness of financial affairs, coupled with busy schedules, Mr. Li Fusun and Mr. Qin Runqing have both expressed their unwillingness to stand for election.</p>
<h3>Meningococcal Meningitis Discovered in This City</h3>
<p>Examination Results Reveal Diplococcus. Since the beginning of spring, diseases such as scarlet fever, diphtheria, and measles have been prevalent. However, meningococcal meningitis had not yet been discovered. Recently, a girl named Wang Rongfu from Doushi Street in the Nanshi district, who had sought refuge in Shanghai from Jiading, developed headaches and vomiting a week ago. The condition gradually worsened, and a certain doctor diagnosed and treated her. However, due to a lack of knowledge of meningitis, the diagnosis was delayed. By the day before yesterday, the girl was unconscious with a stiff neck and other</p>
<p>cerebral symptoms. However, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Houyu encountered her and diagnosed meningitis. He advised sending her to Qu Zhibu Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The hospital examined the cerebrospinal fluid and found a large number of meningococcal meningitis diplococcus. Serum was injected, but the illness was too advanced to be saved.</p>

The transmission rate is high, and deaths are occurring in succession, which is extremely dangerous. It is reported that Dr. Ren Nongxuan, a specialist in pox and infantile diseases at the Xiangfen Lane clinic on Nanjing Road, has considerable experience in treating these diseases, so many parents are seeking his consultation for their young children.</p>

<p>Important Domestic News: League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<h3>Meeting with Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>Visited Zhang in Two Groups Yesterday Morning. Lytton Receives Yano Shinichi. (Beiping) This morning at 10:30 AM, Lytton and Michael accompanied by Gu Weijun and others, met with Zhang Xueliang. The meeting was very pleasant. The French, German, and Italian representatives, as well as Secretary General Haas, visited Zhang at 11:00 AM and conversed with him until 12:00 PM before returning to the Beijing Hotel. At 12:30 PM, Lytton met with Yano Shinichi, the acting chargé d'affaires of the Japanese Embassy, and Secretary Shioda at the hotel. Zhang Xueliang returned the visit to Lytton and others at 4:00 PM, after which he attended a tea party hosted by Gu's and Zhou's three wives at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lytton stated to others: ㈠ He will allocate his time for investigative work during this visit to Ping and plans to decline all social engagements. ㈡ The investigation team is willing to meet with the press more often and is willing to have lengthy conversations with those who understand the situation in the Northeast. He also hopes that more evidence will be provided for reference. He is scheduled to meet with the press tonight and meet with representatives of the people tomorrow. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun's Trip to the Northeast is Necessary</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lytton spoke to more than a dozen Chinese, European, American, and Japanese reporters, explaining his journey from Japan to China. Then, a Japanese reporter presented a telegram from Changchun stating that the puppet state refused the entry of Chinese representatives. Lytton stated that the Chinese representative is a member of the League of Nations representative. Opposing the Chinese representative is equivalent to opposing the League of Nations. Since the Chinese representative is stipulated by the League of Nations, it is necessary for Chinese representative Gu Weijun and others to go to the Northeast. Lytton stated that the team will stay in Ping for about ten days before heading to the three northeastern provinces. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign reporters visited Lord Lytton, the director of the League of Nations Investigation Committee, tonight and inquired about the new government of Manchuria refusing entry to Dr. Gu Weijun. Lytton firmly stated that Dr. Gu was appointed by the League of Nations as a Chinese member of the investigation team sent to the Far East. If he is not allowed to enter Manchuria, Lytton firmly stated that Gu intended to return to Europe. Lytton said that Dr. Gu was travelling to Manchuria with the committee and that the Chinese government was dispatching members of his group, and it had now been decided that no other members would be sent. Dr. Gu was a member of the committee and that they did not permit anyone to question the right of any member of the committee to enter Manchuria, and to refuse one member to enter Manchuria was tantamount to refusing the whole committee. Lytton also answered another question on the day of the committee's departure to Manchuria, the Manchurian government refuses entry to Dr Gu and the committee will also refuse entry. Lytton could not determine whether the Nanjing government had received the Manchurian government's message refusing Dr Gu's entry. Lytton said that on Thursday, when the committee passed through Nanjing, the government had not yet received the message and the committee intends to stay in Beiping for about a week, apart from Zhang Xueliang's banquet. Lytton said that he had already eaten and drank and learned from various places in Japan and China, so he will put aside his idleness and do his work. He will consult on the materials collected with the Japanese government, and then choose a suitable and quiet place</p>
<p>Compile its final report. The location in China or Japan has not yet been decided. It is now hoped that the final report can be issued in August so that it can be submitted for discussion at the League of Nations meeting in September. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei Hosts National Crisis Members</p>
<h3>Speech Highlights Two Key Points of the Luoyang Meeting</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) On the 9th, Wang Jingwei hosted a banquet for the members of the National Crisis Conference. He said in his speech, approximately, that the members came from afar for the sake of the national crisis. The northernmost were the Zhangjia Living Buddha and Mongolian and Tibetan officials, while the southernmost was Mr. Lin Yishun and others from Southeast Asia. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years. Few of his colleagues are still alive, but today Mr. Chen Shaobai, who helped Dr. Sun begin the revolution in the first year, also attended. Most of the members are contemporary economic and educational experts from home and abroad,</p>
<p>the most outstanding members of the country, gathered together to discuss major plans, which not only gives the government more courage to face the outside world, but also gives the people of the country more courage to face the outside world, and it is expected that the results of the meeting will be well resolved. There are two important points in holding the meeting in Luoyang: ㈠ Chang'an and Luoyang are both ancient capitals of China. For five thousand years, the prosperity and growth of our nation and the germination and development of culture have been based here. Today, we are holding a meeting for the national crisis here, which makes us think of the legacy of our ancestors who worked hard to create a magnificent nation in the East, which is enough to encourage us to break through the spirit of the national crisis. This is the first point that should be deeply understood. ㈡ Since the opening of the sea ban, the development of culture and economy in our country has been concentrated in the coastal provinces. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, had already seen that if China had a conflict with foreign countries, such as the Sino-Japanese War or the Japanese-American War, Japan would first attack</p>
<p>Our coastal provinces, the method of resistance must be based in the northwest, in order to consolidate the foundation of the battle and eliminate the enemies along the coast. Unexpectedly, the Japanese aggression against China has been seen</p>
<p>Today, we only have to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last teachings and rely on the Northwest for long-term resistance. This is the second point that should be understood. Summarizing the above two points, today we are holding a meeting in Luoyang to continue the spirit of the national struggle for five thousand years and promote the great potential of our nation for five thousand years. Use the Northwest as the last long-term resistance base to break the most serious and critical current national crisis since the establishment of the Republic of China. Secondly, although the temporary capital is simple, it is enough to see the decline of culture and economy in the Northwest, and it is enough to promote the determination to develop the Northwest. The simple folk customs and low labor costs show that there is no possibility of rapid development. Witnessing the current Luoyang, recalling the past Luoyang, and expecting the future Luoyang, at the same time, associating with the past Chinese nation, the current Chinese nation, and determined to revive the future Chinese nation, break the current difficulties and establish a solid and powerful country, etc. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dai Chen Go to Luoyang Together</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Jitao, Chen Lifu, and Xu Chonghao, Chen Tianxi, and others left Nanjing at 6:00 PM on the tenth, took the Jingluo through train to Luoyang to attend the National Crisis Conference. Wu Zhongxin, Chen Daqi, and others went to see them off. Dai and others are expected to arrive in Luoyang on the evening of the eleventh. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Internal Order for All Provinces and Counties to Comply with Administrative Meetings</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Internal Affairs stipulated that each province's administrative meetings should be convened once a year, and each county's administrative meetings should be convened twice a year to discuss and reform government affairs as a standard for implementation. During this period when internal affairs are in urgent need of reorganization, they should be implemented immediately, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs of each province should be ordered to comply. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Refuses to Accept Documents from Traitors</p>
<h3>Report to the League of Nations and Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Authoritative information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: On the 10th, the Telegraph Bureau delivered a telegram from traitor Xie Jieshi in Changchun, the content of which was roughly the same as the news released from Tokyo on the 4th of this month. The ministry immediately refused to accept it and ordered the original bureau to return it. At the same time, it reported to the League of Nations and the League of Nations Investigation Team, requesting strict implementation of the 12th and 10th</p>
<p>Resolution of the League of Nations, and lodged a serious protest with the Japanese government, reiterating the points repeatedly stated by China, that is, before the Japanese army completely withdraws from the three northeastern provinces and restores the situation before September 18, all traitorous acts in the three northeastern provinces should be borne by the Japanese side. The fact that the content of Xie Ni's telegram was widely spread to various countries by Tokyo five days before it was sent is undoubtedly instructed and instigated by the Japanese government. In the future, if the League of Nations Investigation Team or Chinese representatives cannot fully exercise their functions in the Northeast or an accident occurs, the responsibility should be entirely borne by the Japanese government. As for the Chinese representative Gu Weijun, he should still follow the League of Nations resolution and go to various places in the Northeast with the League of Nations Investigation Team for inspection. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Immigration Policy</p>
<h3>Japanese Migrate to Korea, Koreans Migrate to Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Beiping) When Goto Shinpei was the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, he planned to immigrate 500,000 people to Manchuria and Mongolia within ten years, and issued orders to all counties to encourage migration to the Northeast. To date, less than 300,000 Japanese people have moved to Manchuria. The reasons are: ㈠ Manchuria and Mongolia are cold and unsuitable for Japanese life; ㈡ Our farmers are diligent and it is difficult for Japanese to make a living. Recently, the Japanese have changed their plans and adopted the policy of Japanese migrating to Korea and Koreans migrating to Manchuria, intending to make the Koreans leave their homeland and eliminate the concept of land so that the Japanese</p>
<p>Can permanently occupy Korea. Recently, the Japanese have seen that more than one million people from the Chinese mainland migrate to the Northeast every year, so they use force to invade and actively promote Koreans to migrate to Manchuria in order to achieve their aggressive ambitions. It is now investigated that there are more than one million Koreans in the Northeast, an increase of 400,000 to 500,000 compared to before the incident. Recently, the Japanese have also implemented group transplantation and selected a large number of Japanese intellectuals to migrate to the Northeast to guide the Koreans in the establishment of the Northeast. If this continues, the Northeast will no longer be ours. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The German Election Has An Unusually High Turnout</h3>
<p>Berlin City is Still Peaceful, Hindenburg's Election is Undoubtedly Certain</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Today is the second round of voting in the German presidential election. This time, the competition in the election campaign is fierce, and voters are very enthusiastic. In addition, the weather is clear and peaceful. Before the polling stations opened at 9:00 AM, countless voters were already queuing up outside the door waiting to vote. The voter turnout reported by each province is also largely the same. It is expected that today's vote count will set a new record. Berlin City has been peaceful until noon today, partly due to the police's earnest warning that any disturbances will be severely punished, and partly due to the ban on the sale of strong alcohol today. As a result, every time there is an election in Germany, families hang flags to express their political tendencies. Today, flags are flying all over Berlin City, often with the Republican flag and the Imperial flag next to each other, and the Communist red flag and the National Socialist swastika flag reflecting each other. In the workers' areas, the red flag is the most numerous. As for the election results, it is expected to be the same as the first round of voting, with most districts supporting the current President Hindenburg. Therefore, the attention of the political circles is focused on the rural areas, especially in East Prussia, where the National Socialist candidate won a great majority of votes in the last election. Therefore, German Chancellor Brüning went to Königsberg last night to conclude his election campaign and give the most incisive speech.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 9th: Many political struggles broke out this morning. In the workers' area of a certain high place, several young people tried to set fire to the wooden posts with election advertisements, but they did not succeed. On a certain platform, a flag of the Hitler Party was hung, and a communist climbed onto the roof and splashed the flag with a mixture of carbon compounds from the roof, which immediately exploded, but there was no damage. In addition, 120 people were arrested, including 63 Hitler Party members.</p>
<h3>The President of the German Bank was Assassinated but Missed</h3>
<p>A bullet hit his arm and caused a minor injury. Two assassins surrendered. Reuters, Berlin, 9th: Today, two assassins attempted to assassinate Dr. Luther, the president of the National Bank, but failed. Luther only suffered a minor arm injury. The two assassins were captured on the spot. The assassination took place at the railway station here. Luther was waiting for a train at the station to go to Basel. Two neatly dressed people passed by him. One of them suddenly drew a gun and fired several shots at Luther. Although the distance was close, all but one bullet missed. The assassins did not escape. After firing, the one who did not fire surrendered and asked the stationmaster to arrest the shooter. The shooter smiled wryly and handed the stationmaster the pistol with empty cartridges, saying, "Please arrest me." Soon after, the authorities announced the names of the two: the one who did not fire was Dr. Rosen, and the shooter was named Kutz. In addition, there was an accomplice who was not captured. Rosen is 59 years old, born in the capital of Argentina, and is an author of economics. He and Kutz both opposed the National Bank's policy. Last October, they accused Luther and others of manipulating bills by forging accounts, which was detrimental to the public welfare of Germany, but the prosecutor ignored it. The purpose of today's assassination is probably to draw attention to last year's case. The two admitted that they used to belong to the National Socialist Party, but they left the party long ago due to political disagreements. Although Dr. Luther suffered an unexpected change, he remained calm. After bandaging his wound, he boarded the train to Basel.</p>
<h3>The Problem of the Resignation of the President of the South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>The military expressed strong opposition, and the Minseito decided to impeach the government. Japan United News, Tokyo, 10th: After the news of the resignation of the President of the South Manchuria Railway, Uchida, the military and the Kwantung Army strongly opposed Uchida's resignation because the Manchurian and Mongolian policies are now progressing smoothly. Army Minister Araki met with Prime Minister Inukai yesterday afternoon and presented the military's strong views, asking the Prime Minister to seriously consider retaining him. The military authorities earnestly hope that Uchida will accept the Prime Minister's advice and remain in his original position until the League of Nations investigation team leaves Manchuria.

In view of the strong criticism of the president's resignation from all sides, it intends to recommend Jotaro Yamamoto, who is familiar with the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia, as the president.</p>

The second is currently being assembled.</p>
<h3>New British and American Ambassadors Present Credentials</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Windsor (England), 9th: The newly appointed American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mellon, met the King of England at 12:45 pm today to present his credentials. After the ceremony, the King and Queen held a banquet in the palace and treated him with great courtesy.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Floods in Romania</h3>
<p>Fertile areas have become swamps, and more than 100,000 people have been left homeless. National News Agency, Bucharest, 9th: The floods in the three most fertile provinces in Romania are unprecedented. More than thousands of people have drowned, and the trend is increasing every moment. Because houses are washed away by the floods, the number of collapses is increasing every day. Villagers who live on the roofs are buried in the water. Rescuers are unable to rescue them due to the rapid currents and often return empty-handed. As for the homeless victims, there are more than 100,000 people. They are now camping on the foothills and highlands.</p>
<h3>Money Flew Away, Son Did Not Return</h3>
<p>Lindbergh Fooled by Kidnappers</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th: Lindbergh paid $50,000 in US dollars to the kidnappers of his son, but the kidnappers have not acted as agreed and there has been no news. Therefore, Lindbergh had no choice but to ask the citizens of the whole country to assist in observing and preventing the traces of the bandits when using banknotes. The numbers of his banknotes have been notified by the Treasury to various banks and merchants. Lindbergh paid the ransom in five-dollar, ten-dollar, and twenty-dollar banknotes. At that time, the kidnappers explained the location of his son, but they have not been found so far. According to the New York Mirror, Lindbergh met a senior bandit in a certain place near the city on April 2 and handed over the money. The bandit still carefully checked the banknotes one by one to see if there were any special marks. At that time, the bandit instructed Lindbergh to fly to a certain place and throw a letter, indicating that the child could be sent to a certain yacht in the sea. The first contact failed because rival liquor smugglers scared away the bandits. On the second contact last Tuesday, I hoped to fulfill my wish. Unexpectedly, the police and the coast guard were eager to claim credit and rushed to the news, so the recovery failed again. This is really a mistake of the authorities' rashness. After paying the ransom, I promised the bandits a few days to find an opportunity to fulfill the agreement. I originally did not want to record the numbers of the banknotes paid, but now because the bandits have broken the agreement, I have to use various methods to seek the return of my lost son. Therefore, I asked the government to investigate the banknotes paid to the bandits.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Passes Through Jinan</h3>
<p>Touring the Famous Scenic Spots with Excellent Impressions</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The League of Nations Investigation Team came from Beijing and arrived in Jinan today (the 8th). They only stayed for three hours, so all sectors changed the original welcome order. In addition to the reception at the provincial government, they also toured the famous scenic spots of Daming Lake. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome Situation: This morning (the 8th), national flags were hung all over the city. The roads from the railway station to the provincial government and the roads on the city walls were swept clean. From 2:30 pm, double posts were added for security from the provincial government to the railway station. The railway station had the third security team to maintain order, and there was a military band. A pine arch was built on the station, with the golden characters "Welcome League of Nations Investigation Team" attached to it. On both sides of the pine arch, electric lights clustered the word "Welcome". Fabric banners were hung in front of the waiting room and on the overpass, such as "Welcome the Fair and Just League of Nations Investigation Team", all in Chinese and English. As for the station layout, important personnel from various agencies were placed in the front row of the platform, the military band was to the east, the security team was to the west, representatives from various agencies were on the east side of the pine arch, and representatives from various groups were on the west side of the pine arch.</p>
<p>Those who came to the station to welcome included Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, representing the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, Wang Fangting, Director of the Industry Department, Wen Chenglie, Chief Host and Mayor of Jinan, Han Wenxiu, Deputy Adjutant of the Third Route Headquarters, and other party, military, and government personnel totaling more than 500 people. Japanese Consul Nishida, British Consul Gendron, American Consul Mihar, and German Consul Higuen also arrived. The special train arrived in Jinan first. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, sent the Beijing steel armored train to Xuzhou to protect the special train of the investigation team all the way north. At Lincheng, Dai Hongbin, commander of the steel armored train, and Staff Officer Wei Qingping, led a cover team of 50 people to board the train for escort. At 10:02 this morning, Sun Bin, the county magistrate of Yanzhou County, and representatives from all walks of life welcomed them at the station. Lytton inquired about the local situation in detail. At 10:32, they left Yanzhou. At 1:13 pm, they arrived in Tai'an. Zhou Baihuang, the county magistrate, led the Rende Primary School Boy Scouts and people from all walks of life to welcome them at the station. Lytton and five others, and Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, all got off the train. Lytton and others originally planned to visit the scenery of Mount Tai, but they gave up due to the short time. After a short time, they boarded the train again. At 3:10, they arrived in Gushan. At this time, the welcoming personnel at Jinan Station were all present waiting. The Chief Host, Wen Chenglie, happened to receive a telegram from Representative Gu saying that after the investigation team arrived in Jinan, they would not meet with people from all walks of life except for receiving the press. Jinan originally planned to hold a reception at the provincial government and have people from all walks of life give welcome speeches, so it was temporarily deleted. At 3:50, the special train of the investigation team arrived in Jinan. The group got off the train amid the sound of military music and took 43 cars to the west room of the Pearl Spring guest hall of the provincial government to rest for ten minutes, and then went to the east room for a meal and met with the welcomers.</p>
<p>Reception at the Provincial Government: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, did not return because he was recuperating from illness at Thousand Buddha Mountain, so he sent Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, to wait in the government. After the group arrived at the provincial government, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, introduced them to Gu Weijun. Gu then introduced Zhang to meet the five members of the investigation team, shake hands, and exchange pleasantries. After taking their seats, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Han, saying that today the provincial government and the people are very honored to gather together with the gentlemen of the League of Nations Investigation Team. Chairman Han was very sorry for not being able to come due to illness, so he ordered me to say a few words on his behalf. The gentlemen came from afar and have seen all the situations in Shanghai, and I think they are all clear. When passing through Beijing, they met with the central government, and I think the gentlemen of the investigation team are also clear about the wishes of the central government. Today they came to Shandong. Shandong has been a land of peace and justice for thousands of years in China. Confucius was born in this land. Confucius's lifelong doctrine speaks of loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, righteousness, love, and peace. Therefore, the people of Shandong most believe in courtesy and peace. Only courtesy and peace can eliminate those who are not peaceful and courteous. The reason why the world has peace lies in the point of peace and courtesy. The gentlemen of your delegation are envoys of peace and are responsible for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Chinese people deeply believe that the gentlemen of your delegation can resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute without doubt. I represent the chairman to welcome you, wish you a smooth future, and wish you complete success. Then he raised his glass in respect. After Zhang Honglie's speech, Lytton, the chairman of the investigation team, gave a reply, saying that he was very honored to gather with all walks of life today. What he regretted was that he heard that Chairman Han was ill and did not have the opportunity to talk freely. The tragic situation that our delegation visited in Shanghai does not need to be described in detail. The future report to the League of Nations is not to report the tragic situation seen, but to report the atmosphere of peace everywhere. When our delegation gathered in New York, many Americans had unlimited hope for us. There are many welcomers in Japan and China, and everywhere is an atmosphere of seeking peace, not like there are grievances. Our delegation represents 54 countries and does not want any two countries to have war. We see that everyone hopes for peace, so we hope to overcome the few who are not peaceful with the majority of peaceful minds. Then he also raised his glass in thanks. After the guests and hosts finished their speeches, the newspaper reporters submitted the prepared written opinions to Lytton and raised several questions for him to answer. Lytton's answers to the press were: (1) What is your opinion on the Shanghai truce conference? Lytton replied, "I have just given a satisfactory answer. I see that everyone hopes for peace, which will certainly help the permanent peace between China and Japan." (2) What is your understanding of China after investigating the war zone in Shanghai? Lytton replied, "Shandong is the hometown of Confucius. Thousands of years ago, before the League of Nations was established, Confucius's doctrine was very beneficial to the world. Now we should study Confucius's doctrine to maintain world peace."</p>
<p>Touring the Famous Scenic Spots: At 5:20, the investigation team left the provincial government and took cars to Sijia Wharf to tour Daming Lake. Twenty-four large and small boats were prepared in the lake. Patrolmen also took small boats to patrol everywhere, prohibiting tourist boats from coming and going. The onlookers on both sides were like walls. They first arrived at Lixia Pavilion to tour inside. Gu Weijun accompanied Lytton to see the rubbing of the Tang Wu Daozi painting of Confucius hanging inside, and they all stood in awe. Then they went to the library. Gu Weijun led the group to visit the shells of the Japanese army's artillery fire and the destroyed books when the library was bombed during the May 3rd Massacre in the reading room. Lytton stared at it for a long time. Later, they visited the Song and Yuan books and the ancient artifacts in the room. Lytton picked up the butterfly-bound Song edition of Fan Wenzheng's collection and flipped through it, unable to let go. Gu Weijun explained Fan's deeds to him. Lytton praised the exquisiteness of the carving and said that this kind of culture and carving technique flowed from China to the West. He also saw the ancient Se displayed in the room and lingered for a long time. He praised the ancient porcelain displayed in the room. At 6:30, they left the library and took a boat to Beiji Pavilion to climb the pavilion to look south at Foshan and north at the Yellow River. The mountains and lakes were pleasing to the eye. It was already dusk. At 6:45, they took a bus from Beiji Pavilion to the road on the city wall. At 7:05, they returned to Jinpu Railway Station.</p>
<p>Leaving Jinan and Heading North: At 7:05, they arrived at the station. At this time, the people from all walks of life who came to see them off were all gathered on the platform. Gu Weijun accompanied the group into the station. The people who saw them off took off their hats to pay their respects. Lytton and others all smiled and nodded in return. They got on the train and slowly left north amid the sound of military music at 7:10.</p>
<p>Gu's Conversation: The reporter asked our Chief Representative Gu Weijun about his trip to the Northeast at the library. Gu replied, "Of course I will go to the Northeast. The puppet government has not formally opposed my sending a telegram, but they do not want me to go, which is the truth. The investigation team went from Beijing to Hanzhong and returned east from Hanzhong. The trip to Jinpu north was very satisfactory to the hospitality along the way." Also, the memorandum that our government plans to submit to the League of Nations Investigation Team has been sorted out on the 7th. After a detailed study of the text by all parties, it was submitted to Lytton, Chairman of the Investigation Team, by our representative Gu Weijun on the special train on the 8th. (Evening of the 8th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Passes Through Xuzhou</h3>
<p>There is No Problem with Gu Weijun Going to the Northeast</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The special train of the League of Nations Investigation Team left Puzhou northward at 4:15 pm on the 7th, arrived in Bengbu at 10:04, and left north at 10:24. Representatives from all walks of life in Xuzhou and Fubu had already arrived at the railway station to welcome them, but at around 12:00, they received an urgent telegram from Bengbu from Qian Zongyuan, the director of the accompanying reception on the Jinpu Road, saying that he had received a message from Representative Gu that the special train was arriving in Xuzhou in the middle of the night, and that all the representatives were already asleep, so please eliminate all welcome meetings, but he was very grateful for the kindness. Therefore, representatives from all walks of life temporarily dispersed. Only Zhang Xiaochun, Zhao Guangdou, Dong Yaotang, Cheng Huating, and other section chiefs of the Jinlong Road, and about 20 or 30 reporters from various newspapers were waiting. When the train entered the station, it was silent, and the lights on the train were also closed. Investigation team members Sir Lytton and others, Representative Gu Shaochuan, advisors, and secretaries were all asleep. The reporter boarded the train to visit Qian Zongyuan. Qian talked about the fact that after the representatives of the investigation team returned to Puzhou from Hanzhong, they held a meeting in the Longhe wheel before boarding the train to discuss the Japanese refusal of Representative Gu to go to the Northeast. All the representatives believed that the delegation was entrusted by the League of Nations to conduct an on-site public investigation of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and that both China and Japan should be treated with an equal spirit without any discrimination. The Chinese and Japanese representatives were all invited by the delegation. Rejecting Gu was rejecting the delegation and even opposing the League of Nations. During the meeting, it was unanimously agreed that there was no problem for Representative Gu to go to the Northeast, and the Japanese could not refuse. However, the Japanese are now proposing that the train prepared by our side cannot leave the customs. If the Japanese army does not take responsibility for the protection of our train, the Japanese army must prepare another train. Our side believes that this level is unreasonable and must be decided when we arrive in Ping. After the representatives boarded the train, they felt very comfortable and said that it was better than taking the Longhe losing wheel. When passing through Chu and Bengbu, representatives from all walks of life came to pay their respects. However, when the representatives were meeting, the Japanese representatives Yoshida and Yanzaki followed Sir Lytton closely and refused to leave, with a rather monitoring attitude, so that the representatives could not speak much. The representatives who paid their respects and made speeches simply replied that the League of Nations had decided to adopt a peaceful strategy to maintain peace in the Northeast, or simply responded with a smile. As for himself, he was specifically responsible for the reception on the Jinpu Line. When he arrived at Beining Road, he would be succeeded by Tan Yaozong. The train stopped at Xuzhou Station for one hour before heading north again. The team leaders along the way were divided into three sections to escort the train. Tang Qingjun was in charge from Pu to Xuzhou, Wang Guozhen was in charge from Xuzhou to Jinan, and Sun Jinhua was in charge from Jinan to Tianjin. The responsibility for the security north of Xuzhou was taken by two armored trains dispatched by Meng Xiande's department of the First Railway Artillery Team. (8th)</p>
<h3>The Investigation Team's Report on the Situation in Jingxi (4)</h3>
<p>Appendix: Key Differences Between the League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute, Japan's Counter-Proposal, and the Original Proposal: It requires China to first recognize its so-called fundamental principles. In other words, it requires our country to acknowledge the Twenty-One Demands regarding the disposition of Manchuria and Mongolia. The so-called direct negotiations and the Sino-Japanese dispatch of personnel to discuss troop withdrawal methods have profound implications. Superficially, it seems only to coerce our country into accepting its conditions with military force. In reality, it also implies that third parties are not allowed to interfere in the Sino-Japanese issue. Fortunately, we have not fallen into its trap; otherwise, the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact would have lost their effectiveness in the Northeast.</p>
<p>(6) Discussion of Japan's Five Fundamental Principles: Japan's counter-proposal, which requires China to recognize its so-called five fundamental principles, is tantamount to using the League of Nations' power to seize Manchuria. This is opposed by the League of Nations and not allowed by the United States. When the meeting opened on October 23, the representatives had already seen through its conspiracy. Sir Eric Drummond, the British representative, first questioned the Japanese representative about what the so-called five fundamental principles were. According to a report in the Geneva newspaper, the Japanese government's so-called fundamental principles refer to certain provisions in the Sino-Japanese treaties. If the report is true, then the so-called fundamental principles have other intentions and have nothing to do with the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property. Today, the Japanese representative requests the Executive Yuan to pass its revised proposal but does not want to explain the so-called fundamental principles. This seems to be too deceitful. Moreover, the interpretation of treaties is a legal issue, and according to the Covenant of the League of Nations, it can be brought to the International Court of Justice in The Hague at any time. Why does Japan resort to force instead of seeking this option? This is something we have great difficulty understanding. In addition to Sir Eric Drummond, the rebuttal by Spanish representative Salvador de Madariaga was the most incisive. He said that Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations is the most important article. According to that article, Japan has the obligation to respect China's territorial integrity and political independence. Now, one country is illegally using force to invade another country's territory and saying that it cannot withdraw its troops because the lives and property of that country's residents will be endangered after the withdrawal. But it does not know that the creation of a dangerous environment is also the responsibility of that country. The Japanese representative strongly equates the safety of Japanese residents with its so-called fundamental principles. All of this will set the most dangerous precedent for the future. Sir Eric Drummond also said, observing the Japanese representative's opinion, because there is no guarantee for Japanese residents in Manchuria, Japanese troops cannot withdraw. Because that place is not peaceful, there is no guarantee for Japanese residents. If Manchuria is to be peaceful, China must be forced to recognize its so-called number of fundamental principles. However, the Japanese government cannot currently announce the content of the fundamental principles. This is truly an incomprehensible mystery. However, the representatives of various countries wanted to reason with it, but the Japanese representative calmly replied, "Your words are reasonable, but unfortunately, we cannot agree with you. As for what the fundamental principles are, I cannot announce them because I have not received instructions from the government."</p>
<p>Aristide Briand, knowing that the Japanese representative's attitude was unchangeable, resolutely said that the Japanese representative requested the Executive Yuan to approve its amendment containing several fundamental principles but refused to explain the intention of the so-called fundamental principles, which would cause the Executive Yuan to sacrifice too much. This is absolutely impossible. After speaking, he announced the adjournment. This is a rough outline of the fifteenth meeting on October 20.</p>
<p>That afternoon, the meeting was reconvened. The chairman first put Japan's counter-proposal to a vote. As a result, everyone except the Japanese representative opposed it. Next, the draft prepared by the Executive Yuan was put to a vote. As a result, it passed with thirteen votes to one. Everyone except Japan approved it. Legally speaking, Japan has no obligation to implement this resolution because it did not agree. According to Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, all resolutions of the League of Nations, except for matters clearly stipulated and procedural issues, must be passed unanimously to take effect. Now, the Sino-Japanese dispute is being discussed under Article 11 of the Covenant, so the resolution must also be passed unanimously by the members of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>E. Our Country's Declaration Regarding Sino-Japanese Treaties: Since Japan occupied the Northeast, it has been vigorously promoting to the League of Nations that China has violated international treaties and endangered Japanese rights in Manchuria. Japan had no choice but to resort to force for self-defense. At the meeting, the Japanese representative accused the League of Nations of slighting the sanctity of treaties. On October 24, the British representative declared at the Executive Yuan that the League of Nations did not disrespect the sanctity of treaties, but disputes over treaties should be resolved by arbitration and other methods. In any case, force should not be used abruptly.</p>
<p>In order to make the world understand that our country has no intention of violating international treaties, our country's representative issued a declaration to the Chairman of the Executive Yuan on October 24, stating that, according to the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations, China's obligation to implement treaties is no different from that of other member states of the League of Nations. The Chinese government will also sincerely fulfill the obligations conferred by the Covenant of the League of Nations. In order to show China's sincerity, it is solemnly declared that the Chinese government can, at any time, resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of treaties with Japan by adopting arbitration or judicial</p>
<p>methods in accordance with Article 12 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. It also said that, in order to implement this proposal, the Chinese government is prepared to conclude an arbitration treaty with Japan, such as the arbitration treaty recently concluded between China and the United States. Such treaties have also been concluded by a few members of the League of Nations in recent years. This declaration is a bright and upright way to reject Japan's request for direct negotiations and recognition of the so-called fundamental principles, and it has won the sympathy of various countries.</p>
<p>F. A War of Words Regarding Japan's Five Fundamental Principles: (1) The Government's Declaration Regarding the Five Principles: Japan asked the Executive Yuan to approve its incomprehensible so-called five fundamental principles but refused to explain their meaning. Therefore, everyone believed that Japan was deceiving the League of Nations too much. After the Executive Yuan adjourned, the Japanese government issued a declaration on October 26 explaining its so-called fundamental principles. Japan's so-called fundamental principles are divided into five items: (1) mutually abandoning policies and actions of aggression; (2) respecting China's territorial integrity; (3) suppressing all organized movements that hinder freedom of trade and incite international animosity; (4) effectively guaranteeing the peaceful enterprises of Japanese residents in Manchuria; (5) respecting Japan's treaty-based rights and interests in Manchuria. The first, second, third, and fourth items of this declaration are purely diplomatic rhetoric to win international sympathy, while the fifth item naturally includes the provisions of the Twenty-One Demands regarding Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>(2) The Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Rebuttal: After receiving the declaration, the Chairman of the Executive Yuan gave a reply to the Japanese representative on October 29, stating that, although the Executive Yuan's draft of October 24 was not unanimously approved, it still has moral effect, and Japan has a legal obligation to implement the resolution of September 30. Regarding the meaning of the first, second, third, and fourth items of Japan's declaration, the Executive Yuan's draft of October 22 already contained them, and China approved them. Moreover, the intention of the first, second, and third items of Japan's counter-proposal is also no different. As for the fourth item of Japan's declaration regarding treaty issues, according to the Chinese representative's declaration of October 24, he has clearly declared to the Executive Yuan and Japan the obligation to implement all treaties, which is completely in line with Japan's so-called fundamental principles.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese Government's Complaints and Refutations: After receiving Aristide Briand's reply, the Japanese government complained greatly and replied to Aristide Briand, stating that the chairman said that the meaning of the first, second, third, and fourth items of Japan's fundamental principles has been included in the Executive Yuan's draft of October 24, but he does not know that the first, second, third, and fourth items of that draft are far less clear and comprehensive than the first, second, third, and fourth items of Japan's fundamental principles. Regarding the fifth item of Japan's fundamental principles, according to the Chinese representative's declaration to the chairman on October 24, there seems to be doubt about the validity of certain treaties between China and Japan. It must be known that this treaty is the foundation of Sino-Japanese relations, so the Japanese government absolutely cannot recognize this statement by China as reasonable. Japan believes that before China recognizes Japan's five principles, the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria will not be fully guaranteed, and Japanese troops cannot withdraw to within the scope of the South Manchuria Railway line.</p>
<p>G. The Attitudes of Various Countries:</p>
<p>By this point, the powerful countries such as Britain, France, and the United States had realized that Japan was unreasonably relying on its strength. Since invading the Northeast, it not only has no intention of withdrawing its troops but has expanded the scope of the war to the Beining Railway line. It initially said that the South Manchuria Railway was destroyed, then said that the lives and property of Japanese residents were not guaranteed, and now it is demanding that China recognize its so-called five fundamental principles. Therefore, its attitude at the time was indeed extremely tough. It can be seen that the United States resolutely sent personnel to attend the meetings of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations and independently sent a note to Japan to maintain the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The British representative bluntly questioned Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa, the French Foreign Minister waged a war of words with the Japanese government in his capacity as chairman, and the Executive Yuan's draft limited the time for troop withdrawal. A series of diplomatic methods were all used completely. Although we still believe that this is not enough, further steps would be for the great powers to sever diplomatic relations with Japan or even resort to force. Judging from the environment at the time, this was extremely difficult to do. As for Italy and Germany, they knew that their strength was weak, so they only followed the trend of Britain and France, and the other small countries were even more powerless.</p>
<p>H. China's Protest Regarding Japan's Withholding of Salt Tax: After the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, it also withheld our country's salt tax. Our country's representative sent a letter to the Executive Yuan on November 3 to protest. Based on this, the Chairman of the Yuan wrote to the Japanese representative on October 5 to seriously question him, believing that the withholding of salt tax has nothing to do with the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property. Japan's behavior is truly incomprehensible. The Japanese representative replied to the Chairman of the Executive Yuan on October 5, denying the matter. However, representative Shi published a domestic telegram on November 9, saying that, as of November 7, 600,000 yuan of salt tax had been withheld in Niuzhuang, and 26 million yuan of salt tax had been withheld in Changchun. Since September 18, Japanese military officers have prohibited tax customs in various places from paying salt tax to the National Government. A few days later, the Japanese representative wrote to the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, only saying that the withholding of tariffs was requested by the local government and that the tax money was also used in that local area. Third Stage (November 5 to December 10)</p>
<p>A. The Proceedings of the Executive Yuan's Meeting in Paris: (1) The Reason for Holding the Meeting in Paris: There are various rumors about the reason why the Executive Yuan held its meeting in Paris instead of Geneva. The biggest reason is that the French National Assembly convened on November 12. The Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Aristide Briand, as the French Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the National Assembly, had to attend the Assembly within that week to answer questions from the members regarding French foreign policy. Also, Briand was old and could not bear the hardship of traveling, so it was inconvenient for him to go to Geneva and even more impossible for him to stay in Geneva for a long time. Therefore, he and the members of the Executive Yuan decided that the meeting would be held on November 16 in the hall of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris, called the 65th Session, 17th Meeting, which was to continue the meeting in October.</p>
<p>(2) Cooperation Between the Executive Yuan and the United States: When the Executive Yuan previously held a meeting in Geneva, the United States sent personnel to attend, but the person sent was only a consul general. Sitting alongside the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Italy, many critics ridiculed it as impolite. The reason why the US government did this was because it had no choice. Because the American people have always advocated not interfering in European politics and opposed the League of Nations, the US government resolutely sent personnel to attend the most important political organ of the League of Nations, which could greatly promote active cooperation with the League of Nations and even lead to the trend of joining the League of Nations. If a senior official was sent, it would attract the attention of the people in the country, so only a consul general was sent as a representative to reduce opposition in the country. However, this time the meeting of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations was decided to be held in Paris, and the foreign ministers of Britain and France also personally came forward. Therefore, the United States had to send a senior official to attend, first, to facilitate direct negotiations with the foreign ministers of Britain and France in terms of status, and second, to facilitate making its own proposals in terms of diplomacy. Therefore, it was decided to have the US Ambassador to Britain and US Vice President Charles G. Dawes as representatives.</p>
<p>Speaking of the position of General Charles G. Dawes, he has the position of Vice President and Ambassador. Speaking of his political power, he has the support of some members of the Senate. It is certainly very appropriate to be a non-voting representative now. However, it is a pity that the United States is not a member of the League of Nations. Its participation in the discussions of the Executive Yuan is limited to issues related to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The scope of its speech is limited, so in reality, its position cannot be equal to the position of the members of the Executive Yuan. Also, because General Dawes is the Vice President of the United States, if he attends the Executive Yuan, it will make the United States have great responsibility for the actions of the League of Nations in spirit. Because of these two major reasons, the US government only ordered General Dawes to participate informally and express opinions, but not to attend the meetings of the Executive Yuan.

<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Pays Attention to People's Food</h3>
<p>After the Jiangsu Province suffered from the flood, the national crisis was the first to bear the brunt. The Department of Industry believed that the people's livelihood was related to food. If it does not try hard to meet the supply and demand, it will affect social security, which is by no means trivial. Therefore, it has promulgated regulatory measures and ordered various counties to comply with them. On the one hand, it requested the provincial government to forward it to the Executive Yuan to order the rice-producing provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to allow the circulation of rice and grain transported into Jiangsu Province, not to curb the purchase, and to investigate and prohibit unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating and privately exporting to maintain the people's food. The provincial government shall forward the situation to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions. Now, it has received instructions to approve it in accordance with the regulations. The document says, "The case is that the department previously requested to forward it to the Executive Yuan to order the rice-producing provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to allow the circulation of rice and grain transported into Jiangsu Province and to investigate and prohibit unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating and privately exporting to maintain the people's food. The situation has been forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions, and instructions have been given to each in the file. Now, within the 705th instruction, it is stated that the application is for the purpose of circulating rice and grain and maintaining the people's food, so it should be approved in accordance with the regulations. It should be ordered that the five provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang should comply with it. This order is for the department to know."</p>

<h3>The Fearless Chinese</h3>
<p>— Lu Pin</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, various newspapers in Paris, the French capital, published an alarming message. It said that a Chinese person was studying aviation in France. He was flying a plane alone for practice. Unexpectedly, the plane broke down and fell by itself. It fell from thousands of feet and touched the power lines in the suburbs. At that time, the plane was completely burned down. However, this Chinese flying man suddenly jumped out of the plane when it was about to touch the power lines. He suffered minor injuries and escaped the disaster. In addition to describing the news in detail, the newspaper reporter also titled it "Fearless Chinese" and published it in a prominent position. This year, this fearless Chinese person has repeatedly made outstanding achievements in the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, which is under the watchful eyes of everyone. From then on, the spirit of fearlessness has been further developed. The so-called fearless Chinese person is General Weng Zhaoyuan Teng-hui, the commander of the 156th Brigade of the 19th Route Army, who first resisted the Japanese in Zhabei and defended Wusong to the death without retreating. His spirit of making decisions and commanding calmly and courageously is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>I heard that Ma Zhanshan surrendered to Japan, and I was filled with grief and indignation. So I wrapped up his statue and tied it to a high place. A few days ago, I heard that he sent troops to intercept the return route of the righteous army in Nong'an, and I was even more filled with grief and indignation. So I gathered my children and announced his crimes. I took out the statue and threw it violently on the ground, smashing it to pieces. Yesterday, I suddenly got the news that he had rebelled, and my grief and indignation turned into surprise. If it is true, I am willing to make his statue again and offer him incense and flowers and still call him a hero of the Great Republic of China.</p>

<p>Shanghai doctors who use green sedan chairs. Recently, no one rides in sedan chairs. Green sedan chairs, except for funeral homes to use as soul sedan chairs, have long been eliminated. Mr. Wen Qinfu once resided in Tibet. He said that in Tibet, only three people ride in green sedan chairs: the Panchen Lama, the Dalai Lama, and the Minister Residing in Tibet. Now the Panchen Lama is traveling east, and no one is residing in Tibet. This sedan chair in Tibet is like the Lingguang Hall of Lu. Since the Republic of China, General Sun Xinyuan liked to ride in this sedan chair. He occasionally visited guests, sitting upright with his hands clasped. The martial men were crowded around, and the followers blocked the road. The magnificence of the military was unparalleled. The general may have thought that he was restoring the old, but those who saw it mostly felt that it was inappropriate.</p>

<h3>Shanghai War and Weapons (5)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>From the Manchurian Incident last year to the Shanghai War, the Japanese army used Type 38 heavy machine guns again. Because our army also had the same weapons, the enemy was never able to succeed, and instead, our army swept through them, and they suffered heavy casualties. The second type of light machine gun originated in 1896 and was created by a Danish man named Madsen. In 1905, the United States invented the Lewis light machine gun. Thus, it was adopted by various countries today. Japan also improved and installed the Lewis type, creating a Type 11 light machine gun. There are also machine guns for airplanes, machine guns for tanks, anti-aircraft machine guns, etc. The styles are extremely numerous. The increase in the number of equipment, the precision of the aiming glasses, and the activity of the shooting command are indispensable weapons for infantry and cavalry.</p>
<p>Stone cannons originated in our country. Some say they were created in the Qin and Han dynasties, and others say they started in the Yuan dynasty. Because the era is long and the years are old, it is impossible to verify. However, there was indeed a kind of lifted cannon made in the Yuan dynasty. It weighed five or six hundred pounds, and the cannon body was five or six feet long. It was equipped with gunpowder, sulfur, and fist-sized stone bullets for firing. There was a fire hole above the cannon neck, called the dragon head. The fire hole was connected with a fuse (similar to the fuse used in bamboo today). When the fuse caught fire, the ammunition would explode out. This kind of iron cannon was most commonly used in the Ming and Qing dynasties. In 1339, during the Anglo-French War, the British army had 20 cannons of Ordqnco, which could fire 204 lead bullets every day. The French army was coerced by it and was very embarrassed. The cannon bodies of this kind of cannon were all made of cast iron. Often, the cannon bodies would explode and injure people due to the strong force of the gunpowder. King John II of Scotland died in battle due to the bursting of the cannon body. Later, bronze cannons were invented. During the Daoguang period of the Qing dynasty, Portuguese people came to Macau. He brought four or five of these, which was the origin of our country's import of foreign cannons. Hong Xiuquan's uprising used this cannon, winning every battle.</p>

<p>Liang Xiaoyun suddenly raised her head and said with a smile, "That's great. You are finally willing to listen to me today. You came quickly." Wei Zhuomou also hurriedly covered up his book and made a face and smiled, "Okay, you've come, and we don't have to go to class today." An Yutian pretended not to hear and only took out the gold box, squeezed it in his palm, and said to Liang Xiaoyun, "You lost something in my place last night. Do you know?" Liang Xiaoyun shook her head and said, "I don't know." An Yutian said, "Then, guess what it is." Liang Xiaoyun smiled and said, "Who has so much time to guess this? Anyway, I won't have anything important lost in your place." Seeing that she was not interested in this, An Yutian simply handed the gold box over and said, "It's this." In other words, he almost wanted to say, "Because of this little thing, I was embarrassed." But then he suddenly thought of the words "Li Wenxia", and he decided not to tell her. So he hurriedly swallowed the saliva. Who knew that Liang Xiaoyun was generous. He let An Yutian put the gold box flat on the desk. He neither reached out to pick it up nor looked at it directly. He also sneered and said, "After making a fuss for a long time, it's just this little box. Is this worth making a fuss about? I haven't opened my little handbag and checked it at all since I came back last night. If I lost a little thing in your place, who would be afraid that you would eat it up and not return it to me?" After saying that, he couldn't help but smile sweetly. An Yutian had no choice but to smile foolishly with her for a while, and then he found a chair and sat down blankly, showing a melancholy look, just staring at the two of them in silence. Liang Xiaoyun was looking at it a little strangely. Wei Zhuomou had already opened his mouth and said, "What's wrong? You look like you have a heavy heart today. Why don't you perform a scene of 'Sitting in the Palace', and let Miss Liang guess your worries? I can also play an ugly palace maid and stir up trouble in it." An Yutian, because Wei Zhuomou was a fellow villager and knew his family affairs, angrily took out the letter and handed it to Wei Zhuomou. "Look, this is the letter my uncle An Daqiu sent me. It's really a loss that he can ignore his conscience like that. It's all his personal property, and there is no share for my family. He is taking advantage of the fire to rob and is too much of a villain!"</p>

<h3>The Gold Market Continued to Rise in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Continuing the good start of sixteen taels and seven maces, the gold market situation last week continued to rise sharply with drastic changes. The daily fluctuation was more than ten taels. At first, it rose sharply by more than ten taels and rushed out of the 700 tael mark. After that, the rise and fall were unpredictable. However, the silver market in the United States and Britain fell frequently, but the exchange rate rose and fell from time to time. The Shanghai exchange rate was also quite tight, with the exchange rate shrinking to within one shilling and eight pence. The US exchange rate fell to 32 yuan. The gold industry generally bundled to offset the previous short positions and now still occupies short positions. However, there are fewer short positions recently because they are being purchased one after another. Therefore, the trend of gold prices is unstoppable. The armistice and troop withdrawal meetings are difficult to be optimistic about, and people's hearts are extremely erratic. Therefore, from Monday to Thursday, it fluctuated daily around 700 taels. On Friday, it once rose to a new high of 712 taels and eight maces, and the cash reserve gradually decreased. The Central Bank absorbed it daily, but the price was lower than the futures price. By Saturday, the market seemed to be small due to the news that the United States would convene a silver meeting, and the price returned to around 703 taels. According to this week's total of 25 taels and three maces, the overall increase was still 16 taels and seven maces (it has risen for six consecutive weeks). The settlement price with the US exchange rate is calculated at 670 taels. However, inter-industry transactions are limited, which is due to the unstable situation and the people's hearts are disturbed. Everyone is holding on to their health, and even speculators do not dare to do too much. Therefore, both the long and short sides have no large amounts. In the past, the Dalian gang and the Guangdong gang often had thousands of transactions, which was the norm, but now the payment is less than a thousand transactions. Compared with the past, it is far less than before. It is found that the trading volume of the exchange is only tens of thousands. Now, the general overview of the past week is extracted and recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Varying by Ten Taels Daily</h3>
<p>From Monday (the 4th), with large silver bars slightly longer at .0625, the silver price contracted by .125, so initially, the exchange rate was set, without further adjustment, to US dollars contracting by .125. The internal盘 (market) in both the US and England was tight. Almost as soon as the May standard silver opened, it increased by four and a half taels, reaching 691 taels, then by one and a half taels. Sellers increased, consequently retreating to 87.5 taels. The market then strengthened, with active buying pushing it up ten taels to 97.5 taels. The noon closing was 94 taels and 8 qian. The afternoon opened at 94.5 taels, then steadily rose because the Central Bank continued to inject cash, and the exchange market also strengthened, later rising to 701 taels and 6 qian, eventually reaching 98 taels and 2 qian. By the closing, it was 701 taels, an increase of 14.5 taels compared to the previous Saturday, with a difference of 14.1 qian throughout the day.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, large silver bars contracted again by .125 to .1875, and American silver also contracted by .375. The exchange rate was initially set, with each US dollar contracting slightly by .125. Both official and unofficial rates strengthened. The initial bid price opened at 698.5 taels, a decrease of 2.5 taels, likely because peace talks and a ceasefire had not been achieved, leading to a decline in public confidence. However, after the Central Bank injected cash, there was a rush upwards, reaching 704.5 taels, then fluctuating by two to three taels. The noon closing was 99 taels, and the afternoon opened at 9 taels and a half. Subsequently, speculators, including a Mr. Wu, bought heavily, and with tighter American market conditions, the price rose to 709 taels and 8 qian. Rumors then spread, causing public anxiety, and the closing price was 703 taels, an increase of two taels from the previous day, marking four consecutive days of increases, totaling 23 taels, with a difference of 11.8 qian throughout the day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, large silver bars contracted again by .125 to .0625, and American silver fell by .125. The exchange rate was initially set, with each US dollar contracting by .125. The initial opening price of the gold market was 702 taels, a slight decrease of one tael, due to the Chilean government's abolition of the gold standard. This led to a continuous decline to 97 taels and 5 qian. However, with the Central Bank absorbing cash strongly, the price then broke out beyond 700 taels, reaching .06 taels and 8 qian at noon, and .03 taels and 5 qian at the closing. In the afternoon, it was .03 taels and 2 qian, then .04 taels and 8 qian. Subsequently, sellers became more aggressive. Since there was no market on Wednesday, the exchange rate retreated back into the 700 tael range, reaching 697 taels, and eventually 97.5 taels at the closing, a return of 5.5 taels compared to the previous day, a reaction to the many days of consecutive increases. The market fluctuated by 9.8 qian throughout the day.</p>
<p>On Thursday, large silver bars contracted again by .25, and American silver also fell by .25. The exchange rate initially contracted by .25, and the US dollar contracted by .125. However, there was a different trend in the internal market, with England strengthening and America weakening, leading to a surge in the exchange rate. The bid price opened at 702 taels, an increase of 4.5 taels, then 7 taels and 7 qian. The Central Bank released spot goods, and buyers were active. Subsequently, with the uncertain situation and rumors of a silver conference, the price plunged by over ten taels, closing at 94 taels and 8 qian at noon and 96 taels in the afternoon, then 99 taels. Suddenly, there was news of a Russian mobilization order, causing the price to fall to 95 taels. However, with a small decrease of 13 annas in India, the price rose to 701 taels and 3 qian, and eventually closed at 700 taels and .003 qian, a significant return of 2 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day, with a range of 12.9 qian throughout the day. The entire day revolved around 700 taels.</p>
<p>On Friday, large silver bars contracted again by .1875, and American silver contracted by .375. The exchange rate was initially unchanged, with the US dollar contracting by .25. The exchange rate retreated slightly, and the internal market saw tighter American dollars. The bid price opened sharply higher by 11 taels and 2 qian, reaching 711.5 taels, then from 10 taels to 12 taels and 8 qian. Subsequently, due to the situation, Mr. Wu and others sold off, falling by seven or eight taels to .048 qian, then .07 taels and a half, and eventually .05 taels and 7 qian at the closing. In the afternoon, it was .05 taels and .25, then .08 taels and 7 qian, and eventually .04 taels and 5 qian at the closing. The situation was still flat, with a further increase of 4 taels and 2 qian compared to Saturday and Sunday. The fluctuation was 8 taels and 8 qian throughout the day.</p>
<p>On Saturday, large silver bars and American silver were unchanged, with the exchange rate as before. The US dollar was set higher by .125. The internal market was normal. The initial price of the gold market was .08 taels and 5 qian, an increase of 4 taels, then from .06 taels and 8 qian to 10 taels. With rumors of a silver conference, the Bao Feng stock surged, plunging by six or seven taels at noon, .02 o'clock and a half, and eventually .03 taels and 2 qian at the closing, a decrease of 1 tael and 3 qian. The largest for half a day was 710 taels and the smallest .02 taels and 5 qian, with a range of 7 taels and a half.</p>

<h3>Stagnant Sunday Interest Rate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of the foreign interest market was slightly more profitable than the previous day, with the morning market at 7 qian, 0.06625 li, and the afternoon market at 7 qian, 0.07 li, slightly better by 0.005 li than the previous day's afternoon market. The silver interest rate was changed to a smaller amount of 0.02 fen, calculated as 0.012 taels, with the morning and afternoon prices the same. Due to the bank holiday on Sundays, there was no market for the initial listing and exchange rates. Qian Zhuang foreign public bills collected and resolved over 1.8 million, and silver public bills collected and resolved over 21 million. The amount of remittances made was 160,000 in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. Smaller Qian Zhuang opened remittance heads and banknote transactions for 200,000 to 300,000. The morning and afternoon prices for small Jiangnan silver were both 6 qian, 0.015 li, with only 4,500 jiao transacted in the morning market. The morning and afternoon prices for small Guangdong silver were also both 6 qian, 0.01875 li, with 80,000 jiao transacted in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 411,000 wen per thousand, an increase of 1,000 wen compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Recent Financial Flows After the Reopening of Businesses</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of various businesses in Shanghai on April 1st, the situation has been that retail sales are sluggish and wholesale transactions are sparse, creating almost a dead market. Therefore, the financial community, witnessing this desolate phenomenon, is naturally hesitant to start lending in order to cautiously prevent further losses. It has been over ten days since the reopening, and very few Qian Zhuang are diligently opening and sending remittance drafts. Ordinary merchants who rely on Zhuang loans for working capital are all looking up to the sky and sighing, to no avail. Furthermore, the failure of various industries' requests for interest exemptions to be approved by the financial industry is most relevant to the prosperity and decline of the market. According to the business of the silver and money industry, its only right is interest. How can it be done if its only right is waived? Moreover, the previous year's outstanding debts have not yet been settled. How can the burden of new loans be added? Considering the current difficulty of taking care of this and losing that, seeking a solution is definitely beyond human capability. Therefore, to remedy the situation, one must first hope for peace in the situation. Otherwise, there is nothing to be done but to wait and see.</p>
<p>Slight Movement in Yarn and Cotton Last Week</p>
<h3>Scattered Purchases of Existing Yarn by the Hua Nan (South China) Gang</h3>
<p>The actual need for cotton yarn was extremely quiet last week, but it increased slightly compared to the previous week. After the war, it is difficult for finance to recover temporarily, so how can commerce develop? And the difficulty of the economic situation in the interior is indescribable. Therefore, the yarn price is cheaper than that in Shanghai. As for the Changsha route, warships are clustered and yarn sales are extinct. The northern area has long been occupied by Japanese merchants, and it is difficult for Chinese yarn to gain a foothold. Fortunately, in the Hua Nan area, although a large amount of business is lacking, scattered transactions can still be uninterrupted. Due to the poor external business of the Shu Gang, the amount of goods brought in is also stagnant. In short, the situation has not been determined, and it is difficult to be optimistic about the future of yarn sales before the Japanese soldiers withdraw. According to the statistics, all gangs bought a total of 3,100 bales throughout the week, an increase of 1,110 bales compared to the previous week. The Guangdong and Shantou gangs bought the most. Among the industry peers, 330 bales were brought in, but the market trend was downward. 32-count fine yarn fell by 5-6 taels compared to the previous week, and 20-count and 16-count fell by 1-2 taels. The Shenxin factory occasionally opened small amounts, and other factories did very little. The amount of bales bought by each gang is recorded below:</p>
<p>| Gang    | Bale Amount | Gang     | Bale Amount |</p>
<p>| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |</p>
<p>| Interior | 162        | Yunnan   | 120        |</p>
<p>| Guangdong | 1,120      | Shantou  | 475        |</p>
<p>| Ningbo   | 76         | Xiamen   | 20         |</p>
<p>| Tianjin  | 360        | Wenzhou  | 150        |</p>
<p>| Jiangxi  | 145        | Peers    | 330        |</p>
<p>| Sichuan  | 260        | North Gang | 142        |</p>
<p>| Changsha | 10         | Misc. Gang | 15         |</p>
<h3>Shenxin Factory Brings in Local Cotton to Replenish Shortages</h3>
<p>The needs of cotton mills were still sustainable last week, but there was a significant lack of large deals. Because the world's cotton industry has not broken away from a pessimistic state, most factories are holding a wait-and-see attitude. The Shenxin factory, seeing that the Indian and American cotton markets were at their peak, settled the foreign cotton it had purchased, resulting in a good price. Now, due to a shortage, it has switched to purchasing local cotton to fill the gap. Therefore, it has been most active in purchasing this week. However, selling prices are weakening, falling by 5 qian compared to the previous week. American cotton fell by 20 pounds compared to the previous week. The prices and bale amounts opened by each factory are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Manufacturer | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Number of Transactions | Deadline     | Remarks                   |</p>
<p>| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |</p>

<h3>American and British Cotton Consistently Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rebounded due to good news from Liverpool, short covering, and increased buying. The market was firm and active, with futures rising by 12-15 pounds and spot prices rising by 10 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 14 points and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th telegram).</p>

<h3>The Grain and Rice Market on the Huangpu River: More Rises than Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of goods at the Fengji Wharf on Xilu in Shanghai South was scarce. The stockpile on the Huangpu River was weak, and sales turned active. Due to the shortage of top-quality Northern Japonica rice, the market price immediately increased by 2 jiao. Ordinary stored rice also rose by 3 jiao. According to letters from the interior, the market price of coarse Japonica rice rose because the "Grain Rain" solar term was approaching and people were active. Early rice shipments were scarce and sales were active, with good rice rising by 3-4 jiao. Foreign-produced Du-jian (rice) was quite popular with customers, and the price fluctuated by 1 jiao. The sales of Tongbian Yinyuan (silver dollar exchange) were scarce, and the market showed no signs of rise or fall. Yesterday, the Shanghai North branch of the Zunde Li Rice Merchants Association opened with an increase of a fraction of a jiao for the top-quality Japonica rice of the Chang Gang (Changshu Gang). Due to the scarcity of early rice, prices rose by several fen. The trend of Yinyuan Tongbian rice fell due to weak demand from wine shops. The source of goods from Xilu included 6-7 boats from Liyang, Jiangyin, Kunshan, and Qingpu, each carrying about 3,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Jiangxi Gang Is the Only Active Buyer of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Recently, the Jiangxi gang has been the only active buyer of woolen fabrics. There have been transactions in fine serge, Walter woolen cloth, chocolate cloth, fancy cloth, pull-over woolen cloth, yuanzhi tribute cloth, etc. It is a pity that there are few whole-box deals, and most are sent by parcel post. Yesterday, Deji's No. 2488 yuanzhi tribute cloth was sold for 4 taels and 1 qian. Ningfeng Wannian Ronghua was 4 taels and 0.075 fen. A good-intentioned chocolate West cloth was 3 taels and 1 qian. Xianshou checkered Walter woolen cloth was 3 taels and 0.05 fen. Pengshou Tu Yuanzhuang's blue-gray fine serge was 2 taels and 0.055 fen. Rongkang's was 2 taels and 3 qian. Rongtai's pull-over French blue woolen cloth was 3 taels and 5 qian. Miye's was 4 taels. Zhengchang's was 3 taels. Meizuishi's was 2 taels and 9 qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: A Glimpse of the Chinese and Foreign Silk Market Last Week</h3>
<p>European and American Silk: Exchange Rate Contracted, Prices Rose; Factory Owners Are Burdened with Capital, Transactions Await</p>
<p>The trend of the Chinese and foreign silk markets gradually began to move last week. The movement to boycott Japanese goods (in New York) has spread throughout the United States. Refusing to purchase Japanese silk has already been implemented. Last week, no one consulted about Japanese silk. Sales of Chinese silk were very active. The American exchange rate was weakening, and silk prices rose sharply by several fen in American dollars. The French government (in Lyon) has implemented an import tax on Japanese silk. Although the import of silk from Marseilles has decreased, the amount of silk in Lyon is still large. Chinese silk cannot be sold and is still difficult to develop temporarily. The French exchange rate contracted, and the silk price clearly rose, but the actual price remained stable. (Shanghai) Among the 113 silk factories in Shanghai, only 5 are working hard to resume production after the war. The silk in the hands of various manufacturers is not weak. Almost all are mortgaged to the financial industry. Each bale of silk has a mortgage of about 800 taels. During the week, foreign exchange rates contracted frequently. Although overseas silk prices are reported to be rising on the surface, the asking price is still more than 200 taels different from the capital of Chinese merchants. Therefore, negotiations with American merchants and others are still difficult to complete, and transactions await. As for yellow and white silk, the attitude of Chinese merchants is firm, and the market remains stable. The total amount of current silk transactions for the week was over 300 bales, and the amount of exports was over 400 bales. The market prices of Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of last week are listed below (unit price per pound in New York: gold yuan; unit price per kilogram in Lyon: French franc):</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>Begging for Divine Intervention</h3>
<p>I remember that my friend was using a planchette in a shrine last November. The person maintaining the shrine was Chen Zhongchun from the Ming Dynasty. One day, the planchette descended and said, "From the northeast comes a black cloud, filling the sky and the earth. The people's tribulation is not over. I fear that it will soon extend to both sides of the Yangtze River. All disciples should practice self-reflection."</p>
<p>At that time, the general believers in the community mostly regarded it as ordinary instruction and did not pay much attention to it. But on the first day of the new year, Chen Zhenren (True Person) descended again. The disciples, seeing the war intensifying, asked about this matter one after another. Zhenren replied,</p>
<p>"I briefly indicated the opportunity last year on a certain day. Can all disciples still remember?"</p>
<p>Everyone checked, and they looked at each other in astonishment, because Zhenren had already announced that the war would extend to both sides of the Yangtze River. Therefore, they all bowed and begged for disaster relief. Zhenren then summoned Qin Jingrong, the City God of Shanghai, Wang Yangming, the City God of Baoshan, and also invited Guan Shengdijun (Lord Guan), Yue Wumu (Yue Fei), and two generals from the Ming Dynasty, Qi Jiguang, and Chen Huacheng from the Qing Dynasty, to help the 19th Route Army and eliminate the enemy. After hearing the news, the disciples were all happily delighted, because the gods invited by Zhenren were all famous generals from the previous dynasties, whose careers were brilliant and whose voices were widely known. They would certainly be able to eliminate the enemy and eliminate future troubles. But that's not all. Zhenren also said,</p>
<p>"At present, the tribulation is not over. There are many disciples who have avoided the tribulation by doing good deeds, but it is still difficult to save all living beings." In that case, the enemy cannot be immediately wiped out.</p>
<p>There are also some remaining fate.</p>
<p>When I see the above facts, I have two feelings:</p>
<p>The first feeling is that Zhenren said that the people's tribulation is not over. I fear that it will soon extend to both sides of the Yangtze River. Later, it really did. Moreover, the generals invited to defend against the disaster were all former generals. It happened to fully match the facts.</p>
<p>The second feeling is that since the gods are so divine, why is it that after inviting the generals, no achievements were seen? Instead, it was said that the tribulation is not over and that it is still difficult to save all living beings. From the above two points, the so-called Zhenren only has the wisdom of a prophet and no ability to defend against disasters. It can be seen that it is just like how our country, after Japan occupied the eastern provinces, the authorities adopted a non-resistance policy. Their only reliance was to beg for divine intervention from the League of Nations. The matter is similar to this.</p>
<p>Begging for divine intervention from Zhenren? It was divine. The war did spread to both sides of the Yangtze River. The famous generals Qi Jiguang and Chen Huacheng were indeed invited. One cannot say that it was not divine. But what was its effect?</p>
<p>Begging for divine intervention from Zhenren? It was divine. The General Assembly was indeed opened. The resolution was indeed promulgated. It is wrong to say that it was not divine. But what was its effect?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that begging for divine intervention from the League of Nations is no different from begging for divine intervention through a planchette.</p>

<h3>New Yuefu of Shanghai's Difficulties by Meng Tiaozhu</h3>
<p>Ode to a Traitor</p>
<p>When the enemy wants to come, the Han traitors set fires; when the enemy comes, they greet them on the road. It is tolerable for the enemy to come, but the Han traitors kill me. Alas, you are also human, can you have no liver or intestines? Why are you willing to be an accomplice of the tiger? The accomplice of the tiger hears this and laughs without stopping. In ordinary times, who can I tell my thousands of hatreds to? People ride me as a car, and I am a horse and ox. People live in splendor, and I dwell in cramped quarters. Once the time comes, I will turn the world upside down,</p>
<p>Raise my eyebrows and exhale, and call myself the Buddha without a Buddha. The Huang family's gold, the Western family's beauty, the women hold me to sleep, and I take the gold as I please. Do not be happy for a moment, for when the birds are all gone, the bow will be hidden, and regret will be too late.</p>
<p>Ode to the Truck</p>
<p>The truck goes and stops. Copper beds and teak tables are piled up in disorder. Meeting an acquaintance on the road, they advise him not to go. It is difficult to pass through the tiger's mouth ahead. If you want to pass, you must empty your pockets. I used to live in the northern part of the port, but suddenly I had to flee in panic from the war. In the middle of the night, the thunder shook the walls, and thousands of houses were filled with smoke and fire. I was lucky to escape from the tiger's den, and I had no time to count the things outside my body. After the war, I returned home with a frightened heart. Nine out of ten houses were broken, leaving only charred pillars. The furniture was like a mountain, and it was not lost. Each piece was marked and identified clearly. (Mr. Someone returned to his home in Zhabei after the chaos, and all his belongings were untouched, but they were numbered. This shows the excellent discipline of the 19th Route Army.) The empty truck came from the northern part of the port, and it was fully loaded to the southern part. Innumerable patrol soldiers met and shouted for the truck to stop. If you have money, you can go. If you have no money, the truck must stay. With a lot of gold, the thief's truck goes in front. There are several bribes within a hundred steps. Regardless of the rich or poor, they take a hundred out of a thousand. The bribe is higher than the value of the goods in the truck. Furthermore, there are cunning people who use the tiger's power to cheat, overturning boxes and leaving without a trace. The sound of the truck wheels gradually crosses the bridge, and pedestrians still sing the Kangqu ballad. Hongnan is so vast, but people and vehicles arrive empty. The sound of the truck wheels is hard to hear.</p>
<h3>Spring Regret by Zhu Zun</h3>
<p>Spring comes again, and spring is deeper. Thousands of reds and purples only cause sadness. The most heartless is the willow of Jiangnan, for it does not tie the long branches to the fallen land.</p>
<p>The female butterflies and male bees are wasted as matchmakers. For whom do the peach blossoms bloom and the plums whiten? The most desolate are the grasses of Guanshan, for they allow the barbarians to graze their horses.</p>
<p>Popular Science</p>
<h3>What is Thunder? By Yunli</h3>
<p>Electricity is divided into two types: positive electricity, commonly known as Yang electricity, and negative electricity, commonly known as Yin electricity. These two types of electricity have a special property: "The same type repels each other, and different types attract each other." That is to say, when Yang electricity and Yang electricity meet, or when Yin electricity and Yin electricity meet, they repel each other. If Yin electricity and Yang electricity meet, they generate a great force of attraction to each other.</p>
<p>Both the earth and the clouds contain huge amounts of Yin and Yang electricity. These two types of electricity cannot be seen with the naked eye. When they come into contact, they emit a loud sound and a flashing light, so we recognize that they are working. However, ordinary people without scientific knowledge are superstitious that lightning is a thunder god in the sky, used to punish the most vicious and evil bad people in the world, in order to warn the world.</p>
<p>But where is there a thunder god? But it is important to understand that both the earth and the clouds contain different Yin and Yang electricity. When the amount of electricity is small and the pressure is low, there is air in between, so the Yin and Yang electricity on both sides cannot freely attract each other. When the amount of electricity is sufficient and the pressure is high, these two different types of electricity attract each other, which is the collision of two large forces. The air between the two is subjected to violent vibrations, emitting a loud sound, which is what we call thunder. From this point of view, it is the sound formed when electricity is discharged in the air, not something else. If people or animals on the ground happen to be in the path of this lightning, they will inevitably be struck to death. If there are houses or trees in between, they will inevitably be destroyed.</p>
<p>Since there is electricity in the air, how can it be proven? In 1752, an American scientist named Benjamin Franklin conducted an experiment: He put a kite into the air during a thunderstorm. He inserted a copper needle on the top of the kite, tied a copper key to the bottom of the hemp rope, and connected silk to the bottom of the key, with the end of the silk wrapped around a tree. After the hemp rope was wet by the rain, it could transmit electricity. Therefore, the copper needle on top of the kite, once it sensed the electricity in the clouds, transmitted it to the key through the hemp rope. Franklin also used a guide wire, with one end inserted into the ground and the other end connected to the key, which emitted a brilliant fire. This proves that there is electricity in the air.</p>
<p>When electricity is discharged in the air, why do we usually see lightning first and then hear thunder? This is because the speed of sound in the air is 331 meters per second, and the speed of light is 300,000,000 meters per second. In other words, the speed of light is about a million times greater than the speed of sound. Therefore, when light and sound are emitted simultaneously, the light must reach our eyeballs first, and then the sound reaches our eardrums.</p>
<p>Why is the sound of thunder rumbling incessantly? This is because when electricity is discharged in the air, it encounters obstacles such as high mountains, clouds, rain, and the ground. These obstacles have different positions, so the reflected echoes from each place cannot reach the listener's ears simultaneously, but in a sequence, so it becomes a continuous rumbling sound of thunder.</p>
<p>What About Things From the East, West, North, and South?</p>
<h3>The Miser by Cheng Yuan</h3>
<p>"Shanghai, the land of happiness, is suddenly covered with dark clouds of war. This is truly unexpected. Moreover, fighting with the Japanese is different from the warlords of the civil war, where money can be used to influence things. After thinking it over, what is the best thing to do?"</p>
<h3>Chou Yin Mao</h3>
<p>"Things are getting worse. I received a letter from a tenant the day before yesterday, saying that they wanted to reduce the rent. If I allow them, it will significantly affect my income. I must insist on it to the end."</p>
<p>"In the rubble of Zhabei, I saw more sorrow than anyone else, because it was made from the gold pounds I painstakingly earned as a compradore in a certain industry! If the 19th Route Army had not resisted in the January 28th Incident, not to mention anything else, the rent collected in three months could have built a large Western-style house. Alas! "Fortunately, this Sino-Japanese War"</p>
<p>did not damage my assets in the slightest, because my land is entirely in the British concession! Yesterday I saw in the newspaper that the stage was opening, and the content was more exciting than before the war. Tonight I decided to accompany my third concubine to appreciate it and broaden our horizons!"</p>

<p>First Act: After the opening, the stage is dark. The noise of refugees can be heard.</p>
<p>Subtitle) Title (: January 28, 1932, morning, Shanghai, Zhabei. (Extinguished).</p>
<p>"Boom!" Suddenly a cannon sounds, and sparks fly in the dark. The stage gradually brightens, presenting a gray color. At this time, most of the refugees rush out from behind the stage, men and women, old and young, crying and shouting, crashing around. "Gugugugu······" Suddenly the machine gun roars,</p>
<p>The stage suddenly goes dark.</p>
<p>Second Act: After the opening, a Red Cross paramedic in white clothes, carrying a large basket of steamed buns, biscuits, and other foods, runs around in the refugee industry. The stage suddenly goes dark, revealing the subtitle: Shanghai No. 15 Refugee Camp. March 2, 1932, our army withdrew from Zhabei due to a change in strategy. (Extinguished). At this time, a newspaper vendor shouts: "Hey! Extra! The news is here! Hey! The 19th Route Army has withdrawn from Zhabei!"</p>
<p>The tone is urgent and sad. "Ah!!! Zhabei is finished!" The refugees suddenly shout in unison. The stage is bright. Every refugee raises his fist in anger. (Curtain Closes)</p>
<p>Third Act: After the opening, the</p>
<p>Subtitle: Shanghai streets in the midst of an armistice. (Extinguished). The stage is bright. The words "So-and-So World" are hung on the left corner of the stage. Young gentlemen in Western suits and high-heeled ladies, pairs and pairs, bustling and never-ending. Next to the words "So-and-So World", there are also many slips of paper hung with refugees begging. The refugees kneel under the slips of paper, putting their palms together to beg from passers-by. Everyone ignores them. As if they are very busy, they</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that the article "Wireless Cinema" published in today's edition of your esteemed publication is a plagiarism of an article published in the seventh issue of the "Dong Lin Xi Zhao" magazine (published by the New China Printing House), which I used to edit. The writing and wording are identical. I have enclosed the original article for your perusal. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, (The sender requested that their name not be disclosed, so the signature is omitted.)</p>

<p>Reply to Mr. He Yucai: In response to your inquiry about books on military dogs, there are very few available for sale on the market. Even books on training police dogs are very difficult to obtain. This is because military and police circles in all countries have specialized training facilities, and the training methods are not made public. Therefore, I regret that I cannot provide a detailed answer. 21.4.8, Jianchang.</p>
