<p>時評</p>
<h3>國難與韓劉衝突</h3>
<p>梓</p>
<p>山東韓復渠劉珍年兩軍之衝突。發生於國難週年紀念前後之數日間當此舉國人心。受國難紀念之重大剌戟。方在外憤强梁内悲國運。驚心惕目。慘苦萬狀之時。而足以危害國家之内戰。突然呈現於目前。其感慨失望。逾於尋常。亦所宜也。雖然。國人倘能抛開浮於表面之事象從根本上作澈底之觀察者則應知對於時局。自有可以盡力之處。感慨失望。非應有之態茺作根本有效之消弭。乃爲最適當之辦法耳。</p>
<p>韓劉身處國難方殷之日。良心尙在。非不能知内戰之不可再起者。其駐軍地域。與日人有複雜之關係。環境所迫。非不能壓抑其發動内戰之雄心者而竟不顧一切。悍然發動。則必有驅之迫之迷其心而助其氣之原動力。可無待言。以此次事件之重大。關係之複雜。其特有之原動力。吾人於内幕未經揭穿之今日。自難作確實之說明。惟依中國一般内戰而觀。察其原動力當仍爲軍人生活慾望之剌戟耳。山東轄地一百零七縣。有二十餘縣不受省政府管束省政府即失去五分之一之稅收。韓復渠以軍人任主席。雖號稱賢明總不能不爲拓地裕餉之心理所剌戟。拓地裕餉。軍人之生活慾望也劉珍年以一師長。在北方成獨立之一系。欲維持其勢力必須擴充軍隊欲擴充軍隊又必須搜刮民財。就地搜刮之不足。双必爲向外發展之心理所剌戟。向外發展。亦軍人之生活慾望也。以兩方生活慾望之衝突。内戰之原因即發生。以兩方生活慾望衝突之劇烈。内戰之發生。雖在國難期中。雖有其他之險惡環境。亦在所不遑顧及矣。</p>
<p>生活慾望。具有先天的巨大勢力。爲本人之理智所不能克服。當其剌戟劇烈之時。禍害不能惕。生命不足惜。此吾人任取一社會現象。或生物界現象。可以證明者也。幃復渠治魯有年。政聲不惡。其在國内。不失爲一較賢明之軍人。劉珍年曾受軍官學校之敎育。亦非不明事理之行伍出身者所可比。而不能稍忍須臾。竟在國難之中。以干戈相見。使國人感慨失望。敵國借端張揚。外交代表無法辯護者。亦是心是理也。</p>
<p>以上所述。非欲以此批判韓劉行爲之本體。亦非謂此種事件。國人可以任其自生自滅。不能消弭之也。正以闡明事件之性質。講求適當之消弭方術耳。消弭之方術維何。集中人民之心與力。造成一更偉大而足以控制一切之勢力。平時則以此力向軍人警告。使其不正當之生活慾望。有所畏而不敢發展。内戰將起。則以此力壓迫雙方。使不敢輕於發動。而求根本之解决。軍人生活慾望。對其本人之行爲。有巨大之勢力。人民不能集中心力予以嚴重之監視與約束。則因軍人生活慾望所生之事件。將永使國家成不可挽救之局勢。以力制力。爲最適當之辦法。空前之國難。不能使山東之内戰不發生者。國難之力量。不足以抑制之耳。</p>

<p>拒絶接受出獄條件</p>
<p>爲低等階級爭人格</p>
<p>國民社十九日孟買電　今夜甘地拒絶接受印政府釋放出獄之叙辱條件、甘地謂渠不切望開釋、而願聽政府强自伊拉夫達獄移之出云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日浦那電　甘地拒絶政府釋獄之條件後、已於今日正午起在伊拉夫達獄中開始作「絶食餓死」之偉舉、政府願許其回家絶食、但不得移動、甘地則不願接受任何條件、政府今已弛見客禁令、故甘地今晨曾會晤印度人各代表、低等階級者亦在其内、續電云、聞甘地體不適、其醫士巳勸其勿再接見來賓、</p>
<p>路透社二十日阿赫美達巴電　甘地甫宣告絶食、同時印度正敎徒聚集此間寺門前、作示威運動、反對容納低等階級之建議、卒由警察將洶怒之羣衆驅散、</p>
<p>國民社二十日普那電　甘地今日進午　後、開始絶食、當鐘鳴十二下、甘地遂進其絶食前最後一餐、所食爲全麥粉麵包、浸水無花果·番茄·橘子與凝乳、最後其秘書以震顚之手、進甘地每餐後常飲之檸檬汁、（攙和小蘇打）餐事遂畢、甘地乃偕其最忠誠之徒衆二人祈禱數分鐘、即宣告開始絶食、</p>
<p>國民社二十日孟買電　今日下午一時、甘地在法律上巳自奉拉夫達監獄釋放、惟因甘地認此次釋放、附有羞辱條件、不願出獄室、窮當道業以被釋者相待、准其自由接見往訪者與隨時離獄室、僅不欲達其意志强制遷出獄室耳、今日下午二時半忽又宣告甘地地己身體遠和、不能接見往訪者、其違和蓋由邇來操勞過度所致、故獄醫禁其接見寳客、今午獄門外印人麕集、皆來探詢甘地絶食消息、多有欲一見甘地、迨聞病耗、皆出意外、現金印因甘地絶食發生極大擾攘、巳有無數城市宣布地方杯葛、各村鎭紛紛祈禱其召集市民大會草擬向政府請願文者數亦不少、</p>
<p>德國拒絶出席</p>
<p>軍縮主幹會議</p>
<p>漢德森請德重行考慮</p>
<p>德對英覆文大爲失望</p>
<p>路透十九日日内瓦電　軍縮會主席漢德森接德國來函、聲明德國不出席於星期三日軍縮會主幹部之會議、漢氏現已函覆、表示扼腕、並謂渠確信會議結果甚關重要、尙望德政府重行考慮其不出席之决定、因德國久不出席、則世界軍縮前途、或不免大受影響也云、</p>
<p>國民社二十日柏林電　軍縮會議主席漢德森復德國函、措辭雖誠懇、聞德政府仍將遵行原議、不出席軍縮會議、關於軍縮問題、刻又有英國新聞記事報刋載漢德森所撰文、引起此間甚大之注意、漢氏在文内公開懇請舊協約國踐行凡爾賽和約第五章序文所載諾言、實行减縮軍備、此外英報亦有嚴厲打擊英外相西門致德牒文措辭之極不友誼者、今日德報皆轉載云、</p>
<p>路透十九日華盛頓電　國務院某高級人員今日表示意見、謂德國軍備平等之要求、美國對之不勝嘆息、以其或將妨及世界軍縮也、惟歐洲政治難題、苟與軍縮會無若何關係、則不爲美國所考慮之事件云、此間一般感想、以爲總可設法、使德國在明年二月舉行軍縮大會以前、復行加入會議、</p>
<p>路透十九日柏林電　德人初料英國關於德國軍備平等要求之覆文、必措詞和緩、而提議調解辦法、今見英國來文乃大失望、今日柏林一般批評、皆以把持凡爾塞和約爲言、除社會黨伏威資報及國社黨安格利失報外、各報皆贊助政府不再與聞軍縮會工作之態度、伏威資報則謂德國外交政策向孤立前進、而安格利夫報勸政府自巳解職、今晨興登堡總統接到巴本總理關於英國來文報告、及内閣對於此事之意見、政府發言人稱、英國所持德國未有迫切理由遽提出糾紛極大之政治問題一說、德國不能接受、自無待言、英國指責德國行逕足以擾亂國家和諧、此種措詞不友好之形式、亦無理由實則德國鑒於軍縮會之性質、不得不以此問題付討論此云、</p>
<p>路透二十日倫敦電　外相西門今日首途赴日内瓦、參與軍縮會議之主幹部集議、財政部國會秘書孟塞爾爲國聯大會英代表、亦同車行、</p>
<p>國民社十九日巴黎電　法國輿論自報紙所反映者而觀、對於英國感想等已一變、日前法報多疑英國同情於德國軍備平等要求因此頗示敵視態度、今見英政府致德牒文後、莫不一變而竭力讚譽、如巴黎回聲報稱、爲歐戰後外交文件最明巧者之一、晨報稱、英國牒文第一段與法國主張相若、故與赫禮歐致德復文、多不謀而和處、惟法報對於英國牒文第二段、則殊不若是歡迎、且略有畏懼意、如小巴黎人報稱、爲空泛而甚致含有危險性晨報聲稱、第二段得沙爲基礎、希望英人建議不致實現又社會黨黨民報亦於袒英狂熱中、稍澆冷水、謂英報與其政府之見解大異、仍認德國要求根本公允云、</p>
<p>路透十九日羅馬電　意大利雖贊助德國軍備平等要求、但消息靈通者重加研究後對於英國之文告、均加贊許、覺此文可啓竟求各方能予接受之解决途徑　　俄海軍大演習</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>劉珍年部退出平度掖縣</h3>
<p>十九日潍縣通信、膠東軍事、據此間所得平度縣長來電、謂曹師長福林昨率榮光興李漢章兩旅、前進到掖縣平度間欲以解决在平度之劉軍一部、該部未敢抵抗、昨晚即放棄平度、退到掖縣、聞劉軍在沙河者、亦退掖縣、以與由平度退掖縣軍會合一處云云、據昨晚消息、前方雖有小接觸、劉軍輒望風而退、無甚抵抗、一般觀測、劉珍年以戰線太長、不僅放棄平度、亦且不守掖縣、將來必退守棲霞萊陽蓬萊等縣、最後决戰必在牟平、因劉軍在牟平甚熟悉、　年曾敗張宗昌褚玉璞、今在牟平埋置地雷及電網等防禦工事、以爲固过之計也、韓復榘現仍在昌邑、率陳德馨馬貫一兩旅、及騎兵旅李宣德部、在烟濰路線上指揮前進、曹福林率榮光興李漢章兩旅、則由平度指揮前進、寗純孝旅爲總預備隊、一部留駐濰縣、一部向昌邑前進、參謀長劉書香亦在濰縣、調度一切、又據總指揮部消息、今（十九日）早二點接韓主席來電稱、前方小有接觸、劉軍望風潰退、形極驚慌、我軍遂佔領掖縣、平度、路之曹師長率榮李兩旅、亦到掖縣會合、仍搜索前進云云、現省方對討劉軍事、極抱樂觀、預定兩星期内可以解决劉部、至多亦不過三星期、因劉雖决心抵抗、而所部不足三萬人、不及省軍之半、所據之地、三面濱海、後退無路、如無有力接濟、將來必歸失敗、</p>
<p>此次戰事爆發、省中所發文電、雖列舉劉軍罪狀、大有吊民伐罪之意、實則根本原因、仍在財政問題、當今春劉與省府交涉協濟所部軍餉時、初索每月十萬、後增至十二萬、及省府允予十二萬、彼又非十五萬不可、當時曾由某要人從中斡旋、令劉較十五萬之數稍爲减少、省府無不應允、詎劉僅允每月减少五千元、非十四萬五千不可、此事遂成僵局、調停人亦無法調停、嗣後劉即任意截留稅欵、使省方財政大感困難、山東政權亦被破裂、兩方積不相能、遂至成今日之局面、</p>

<h3>西行記（廿四）</h3>
<p>延長石油廠之現狀</p>
<p>一日八時、晨娶旣畢、全相赴西門外參觀延長石油廠、當由監督包君引導參觀各處、約二小時而畢、該廠目下情况如後、</p>
<p>油井　（一）第一油井（現稱苐一號井）光緖三十三年四月開鑿、七月見油、至八月初止、計　二百四十三尺、徑一尺、初開時每日出原油約三千餘斤、至民國二三年、每日只能産油二三百斤、民國六七年、牽油復旺、每日約六七千斤、據稱係地震之故、民國二十年加深三十尺、而每日産油量仍在二百斤左右、井中因水勢陸續增加、故排水機漸加至四個、出水熟鐡管二寸徑、油井自地面起至一百尺止、置有一尺徑鐡管、再下爲岩石、不用鐡管、二寸管（每節長二十尺）則置布二百七十尺處</p>
<p>（二）第二油井（舊第二號井）在第一油井西北五十餘丈、深二十七八丈、每日可産原油一百七十餘斤、民元毁於匪、</p>
<p>（三）新井第一號　十七年冬開鑿、至十八年四月出油、深計五十三丈、在五十二丈處見油、鑿井費約四千元、初見油時每日能産原油二萬斤左右、因産油太富、製煉不及、目無處貯存、故每出油一天、須停採數天、至十八年八九月每日産油量减至七八百斤、至十九年春再减至二三百斤、又陸續遞减、現在每日仍産原油三百斤左右、鑿井費約四千元、機器尙未計入、</p>
<p>（四）新井第二號　民國十八年冬開鑿、十九年二月完成、深約六十丈、在舊第一號井之西百餘丈、在一號新井之南三十餘丈、未出油、</p>
<p>Ｉ</p>
<h3>建築第一新井櫓台之情形</h3>
<p>Ｉ</p>
<p>（五）新井第三號　在舊二號井北三四十丈、十九年春開鑿、是年六七月完成、深約四十七八丈、原油黑而稠、産量甚少、故未採油、鑿井費約三千餘元、</p>
<p>（六）新井第四號　在新井一號東三十餘丈、十九年七八月開鑿、二十年春完成、深約六十丈、産油甚少、故未採取、</p>
<p>（七）新井第五號　在舊一號井西南三十餘丈、二十年春開鑿、至五六月完工、計深三十二三丈、未見油、</p>
<p>嗣後因鋼繩多斷、機件損壞、欵項支絀、未再續開、</p>
<p>採油　現在採油油井爲舊一號井及新一號井、分述於左、</p>
<p>（一）鍋爐　每井有蘭克式二十五匹馬力鍋爐一座、爐橋二尺見方爐水係用人力自小河中挑至三尺見方四尺深之水池中、再由水池利用蒸汽將水打入爐中、水尙淸潔、鍋爐每年洗二次、爐痂白色、厚約二分、燒半小時升汽、現一號舊井須打井五小時、採油祗九分鐘、新井一號打水採油共須一小時、兩爐每日燒煤一千四百斤、每千斤洋七元、燒柴一千斤、價三元三角、</p>
<p>（二）汽機　汽機每井一座、各十五匹馬力、</p>
<p>（三）採油　舊一號井、每日六時開始打水、至十一時水盡油出、再打九分鐘而油盡、現每日能出原油二百斤左右、新一號井每日打水五十餘分鐘、水盡出油五分鐘、約産原油三百斤左右、舊一號井原油用二寸管輪送至貯油池、新一號井原油用六寸管輪送至第一號貯油池、池三尺寬五尺長五尺深、能容油一萬二三千斤、再用二寸水泵、打入第一號煉爐、</p>
<p>煉油　第一號煉爐長十二丈、徑三尺、能容原油七千二百斤、每二十四小時能煉油一爐按現在出油情形、每隔二十日可煉一次、原油入爐後、在爐底燒火、每二十四小時燒煤三四百斤、燒柴六七百斤、低温度時出一號油、温度加高卽出二號油、汽體油經過一高三十寸徑十九寸之漏器、即由二寸鐡管經過冷水池、使汽體變成液體、而入貯油池、冷水池之水、係用人工由延水排人、每原油七千二百斤、能出燈油一百桶至一百二十桶（每桶油重二十五斤）、第一號煉爐之渣子、約有一千八百斤、用人工挑至第二號煉爐、該爐形似一號爐而較小、徑三尺深六尺、每渣子一千八百斤、能提出二號油一千斤、提煉時間爲十二小時、二號爐渣子另行貯存、現未提出其他副物、二號爐所提煉之二號油經過毛袋漏出後、即行出售、毛袋中之渣滓、熱至　氏表六十度、卽有一部分　化而爲軟蠟、未　化者爲黄蠟、黄蠟質於一鐡桶之上、該桶係圓椎形、上部徑五寸下端徑一尺、高約三尺、桶底爲有孔鐡板、鐡板上置黃紙二三張、黃紙上置河沙二寸、河沙上置骨灰二三寸、黃蠟即置於骨灰之上、桶外復有桶、上徑一尺、下徑二尺、高相若、兩桶之間、注人開水、黃蠟即變成液汁而漏下、變成白蠟、卽注入濁摸、每模能製燭二十四支、色潔白、與舶來之洋燭、不相上下、一號油原來每三千五百斤加硫酸十斤曹達二斤半、洗凈後每次約失去油一二斤、現因硫酸價昻、不加洗凈、卽行出售、故煤烟較美孚油略重、</p>
<p>營業　一號油在廠交貨者每桶售價洋五元五角、二號油三元五角、現在每月能舊油一千一百餘元、支出相等、收支可勉强適合、</p>

<p>組織及職工</p>
<p>（一）該廠之組織丨監督丨總務科丨會計股丨文牘股丨營業股丨度支股工務科丨鑽探股丨採取股　　製煉科丨煉油股丨製蠟股</p>
<p>（二）職工人數　現在職工人數約三十餘人、職員薪水每月由六十五元（監督）至十七元不等、工資每月由二十五元至八元</p>
<p>其他之考察　一百上午十時延長石油廠之考察旣畢、胡博淵馮景蘭謝家榮王竹泉楊公兆胡伯素黄伯逵等步行至距延長北十里許之烟霧溝、考察該處小河中油苗、由延長至烟霞溝越過一高約一百五十公尺之山、油苗有二處、其一油在水中上升、土人每日能取油十斤餘以燃燈、其一油往多處流散、亦在水中上升、無法取之以利用、油係黑綠色、由水中上升時、形者蝌蚪、及至水面變爲扁圓形、稍向下流、此小扁圓形卽再擴大而浮於水面各處矣、據一般地質學家謂該處如打孔鑿井、或可得巨　之石油、視察約半時、即取道返延長、歸來時已在下午四時後矣、</p>
<h3>陜地地質之分析</h3>
<p>實業部地質調查所代表謝家榮君、係現代在中國極有地位之地質學家、謝君經騐旣富、著述亦多、此次參加考察、範圍之廣達十餘縣、而路綫之長達二千餘里、對陜北地質上之觀察、頗爲透澈、茲將謝君對於陜北地質研究之結果、分述如左、</p>

<h3>二號煉油釜未遷移時之狀况</h3>

<p>陜北爲盆地　常人皆以陜北爲一高原、因其地面平坦、而又高距渭河之谷、自三百公尺至七八百公尺故也、就地理學定義言之、無論自地形方面或地質方面觀之、陜北皆係一盆地、而非高原、高原與盆地之别、不在其絶對之高度、而在其相對的比較、即渭凡在一平坦之原野、若其附近俱爲低地、是爲高原、否則週圍皆山、則爲盆地、今自西安北行、經三原耀縣之黃土台地而達同宮宜君之山地、過此以達中部洛川、地勢倐低、是爲盆地之南緣、自山頂四曬、則東西皆界以高山、此就地形言、陜北爲一絶佳之盆地、再考盆地中之堆積物、則除浮面之黃土　層外、以第四紀之三門紅色土（詳後）爲最多、第三紀之三趾馬紅土次之、此二者皆屬古代内湖之沉積物、亦卽盆地地形之産物也、此就地質言、陜西亦一標準的盆地、</p>
<p>地層之憎次　研究一地地質、首　明瞭地層之層次、若者爲新、若者爲古、各層之性質如何、脈度如何、皆須詳查、蓋如是則構造之推測、地質之發育、皆糧是而言、在陜北盆地中所見地層自下而上、可分爲（一）侏羅紀之陜西系地層、厚達七八百公尺、下部多砂岩中上部多頁岩、並含　煤、延長虜施等所産之石油、亦自此出、因其上但覆以廣厚之紅色土及黄土地層、故本層大部皆在深被剝蝕之溝谷中　出、而爲造成陜西盆地沉積之基磐（二）三趾馬紅土層此層以含三趾古馬之化古而得名、層上新統、因受剝蝕之結果、故現在陜北殘留者、不過二三十公尺、往往水溝底緊接於陜西系基船地層之上出露、中部洛川一帶較爲發育（三）三門系之紅色土層屬第四紀、以首先發現於黄河邊之三門故名、爲此次調查所常見最發育之地層、厚達二百公尺、全部以帶紅色土壤爲主、稍夾粘土或砂層、尤爲顯著者、爲石灰質結核之特多、此層之紅色、較其下之三趾古馬紅土、大爲不如、但與其上之黄土相較、則一紅一灰、分判甚易、（四）黃土、在昔談華北部質者、皆以黄土爲絶厚之沉積厚度、可達千尺以上、最近研究乃知不然、其土蓋在黄土與其下紅色土之混合不分、此次考察、所見黄土、或被覆於山頂之上、或充填於河谷之中、其厚度皆不能過五十公尺、因其係一種浮面之被覆物、故往往整個紅色土之山爲其蓋没、粗視之一若全部爲黃土所成、但在新切谷溝之中、則内部紅土、往往出露、地層眞相、乃可一覽無餘、」以上所述、皆係盆地以内之地層、至若盆地邊緣、或接近邊緣之處、較古之地層、如奥陶紀石炭紀二疊紀三疊紀等地層、種類尙多、因其與盆地之發育、無大關係、故不多述、</p>
<p>盆地之發育　以上所述之陜西系地層、除局部因斷裂、或縐䌌關係、致成峻急之傾斜外、大致俱近水平、而略向西折、由此可證明自陜西系地層沉積之後、該處僅受整個的上昇運動（亦稱大陸運動）、而未受過發生縐䌌的造山運動、又自紅土或紅色土以下、陜西系地層石面之異常平均一點觀之、可知陜西地層沉積而又掀起之後、復曾深受剝蝕、其剝蝕之結果雖不及造成一準平原、但已達成年晚期之地形、卽謂地面上無甚高山大嶺、僅有低緩鑛邱、而在此稍具邱壑之石面上、經過地盤下沉之作用造成一廣漠之内湖、於是遂有三趾馬紅土之沉積、紅土沉積之後、地面復上昇、剝蝕作用繼之、使已成之紅土全部或一部冲刷以去、因之在陜北紅土層之餘存、頗不完備自此以後、地盤復下降、又成内湖狀態、在此中遂有巨厚之三門紅色土造成紅色土旣經沉積、地盤復逐漸上昇、至七八百公尺以上、同時剝蝕作用、不斷進行、遂發生多數之河谷、是時氣候倐變爲乾旱、風力猛勁、挾帶遠近泥砂、飛揚而起、繼復下降、堆積山坡、或充填河谷是爲黄土、陜北盆地整個發育之歷史、當如下述、（一）陜西系地層之沉積、（二）地盤上昇、使地層略向西折、（三）剝蝕至成年晚期之地形、（四）地盤下降、造成内湖、而有紅土之沉積、（五）地盤上昇、使已成紅土一部或全部冲刷以去、是時地向亦發生多數河谷、（六）地盤下降、内湖復生、此中遂有三門系紅色土之沉積、（七）地盤上昇至少在七八百公尺以上、同時剝蝕隨之將地面切成多數河谷如洛水漆水延水等重要河流、皆於此時造成、此項水系之位置、大致皆與第五項中所造成之河流相吻合（八）氣候倐變乾旱、風砂飛揚、造成黄土、</p>
<p>至於造成紅色土或紅土時代之氣候狀况、今尙不能臆測、大致言之、當係潮濕酷熱、故土中鐡質多養化、乃發生殷然之紅色也、（未完）</p>

<h3>改革中國學校敎育芻議（一）</h3>
<p>程天放</p>
<p>「改革敎育」、「改革敎育」這種呼聲、近幾年來常常接觸吾人的耳鼓、自從去年九一八以後更是高唱入雲、本來提倡了四十年的新敎育、而國家的危險、人民的痛苦、社會的不安家較四十年前　甚任何人平心一想、都不能不承認過去敎育之有缺點而需要改革但是如何改革呢、道爾頓制麽蒙台梭利式麽、從杜威的事說廖、依羅素的主張麽那就莫衷一是了、我不是圖敎育專家却是因爲從事敎育行政的　故對於中國現在學校敎育的不良很有點感觸、同時也有點改革的意見現在把牠寫出來以質諸益豈、也許有人要恭維我立論新奇也許有人要抨擊我發言荒謬、恭維的話我不敢當抨擊的話我决不反駁但是我很希望海内敎育家和關心敎育的人平心靜氣的對我的主張商榷一番或者於改革敎育的實際工作發生相當影響那就不僅是我個人之幸、也是中國敎育之幸</p>
<p>要談改革敎育我們首先要弄淸楚、敎育是什麽我們要知道敎育與文學藝術不同、文學與藝術可以沒有另外的目的本凟就是目的所以我們說「爲文學而文學」、「爲藝術而藝衛是講得通的、但是「爲敎育而敎育」就講不通了敎育無論就個人講、就國家講都只最一種方法、一種工具一種道路、要用這種工具這種方法這種道路去達到另外一個目標的就個人譜中國人從前受敎育的目標大多數是想做官、現在許多人受敎育的目標是想發財、做官發財祇要是由正當途徑不一定就是瑣事但是個人受敎育正當的目標應該是用敎育以發展身心使得他更能了解生活的意義享受生活的興趣同時在社會上是一個健全有益的分子就國家講敎育的目標就是國家的國策、換句話講敎育是國家施行國策的工具、所以國家需要何種　業敎育就應該造成何種事業國家需要何種人才、敎育就應該培植何種人才能夠做到這層、這一國的敎育就是成功、不能做到這層這一國的敎育就是失敗所以一國敎育的目標、完全因國策而轉移而敎育制度敎育内容、又應該隨敎育目標而定、國策旣然國與國不同、此時與彼時不同、敎育目標敎育制度、敎育内容、自然也就離不了「當時」「此地」兩個重要因素甲時甲地的敎育固然不能和甲時乙地的敎育相同、就是甲時甲地的敎育、也未必與乙時甲地的敎育一致中國過夫敎育失敗的原因、就是忽略了這一層道理敎育制度敎育内容只、知道盲從他國的主張摭拾西哲的牙慧完全沒有針對國家的需要、所以學校所造就的學生·不是國家所需要的人才也不能擔任國家所需要的事業、所以結果學校儘管一天多一天受敎育的人儘管一天多一天而國家反而更亂　窮去危亡更近眞値得我們喚息痛恨的了往者已矣來者可追、現在要想改革敎育以救國家的危亡、首先要認定國家的需要、然後按照這種需要來定敎育的目標目標就定　一切敎育制度敎育内容都要向此目標前進這種敎育才可以糾正過去的缺失、才可以擔當救國的重任</p>
<p>中國現在所需要的是什麽東西、敎育的目標應該如何定呢、這個問題的答案、可以人各不同、但是依我看中國的最需要的、是下列五種東西、而敎育也就應該有下列五個目標、第一、現在是民族競爭的時代、而不是個人競爭的時代、人家對於我們的侵略、不論武力侵略也好、政治侵略也好、經濟侵略也好、都是用整個的民族的力量來進攻的、我們假如不是用整個的民族的力量去抵抗他們、就一定抵抗不住、一定有滅亡的危險但是很不幸的我們民族大多數分子是不識不知智識能力都在水平線以下、在這種情形之下、我們與人家競爭如何能不失敗呢、我國人口百分之八十以上是鄕村農民、他們終日胼手胝足以養活自己、并且養活他人、他們的勤勞、他們的儉樸、實在可以愧死一班不勞而亨受的大人先生、他們實在是國家元氣、但是他們的智識、實在幼稚得可憐、他們的能力、實在薄弱得可笑、他們大多數不識得筆書最簡的文字、不懂得最淺近的數學、沒有最初步衛生和科學的智識、對於國家民族危險的情形茫然不知、對於本國的史地、世界的大勢、絲毫不曉、他們不知道團結、不能夠互助、不能夠自衛、對於貪官污吏的剥削、赤匪流寇的焚殺、永旱天災的襲擊都只有採無抵抗主義坐而待斃眞是可憐極了、這種人雖多、怎麽能挽救國家的危亡呢、但是我們不忍責備他們、我們要責備國家、他們之所以無智識、無能力的原故、完全因爲國家沒有給他們以受敎育的機會、我們現在必須以敎育力量提高他們的智識、增加他們的能力、使得他們成爲健全的國民、能夠盡他們對國家的責任、所以養成大多數健全國民、是中國目前第一個需要、也是中國敎育第一個目標、</p>

<p>交易不弱····銀行買進</p>
<p>昨銀市忽已報升、惟匯兌則小、然本埠市况平穩、匯豐掛牌除印度加二五外、餘均不更、殆内盤早鬆後平、午後趨緊、金市亦前仆後起、又出現七百卅四兩四錢新高價、迨結果比較前晚計英金扯平、美金略縮零六二五、終日未有若何變化、華商交易頗不在少、計英金成交幾將十萬鎊、稍有扒結、銀行亦有對做、美金共計六七十萬元、前市大致抛出、後市先抛後扒、間有套回條子、而金價如一月份拔開四十四兩光景、各銀行買胃不弱、又銀公司前出後進、並聞美金有美棉結欵、故銀行方面有買進頭襯、市况復盤穩健、而銀市有看縮之勢、今將成交價以紀於後、　　英匯　内盤一日間計有一二五之盤旋、自早開賣價九月一先令九便士、十月零六二五、十一月一二五、十二月一八七五、買價按月照加一二五、中國賣與中孚十月九便士一二五、匯豐出十月亦計一二五、午收與早開價相同、下午有利正金對做九月、又華比進十月、價同爲九便士、中孚出十二月一二五、收市出價八便士九三七五至九便士一二五、進價九便士至一八七五、　　美匯　内盤全日計有二五廻顧、自早開出價九月卅元三七五、十月四三七五、十一月五六二五、十二月六八七五、進價各月照加一二五、中孚入正月卅元八七五、華比浙江均吃十二月八一二五、中孚出十月卅元半、三井正金對做九月四三七五、花旗入正月八七五、浙江中孚互做十二月七五、盤根進（美銀公司出）十一月六二五、大通賣與正金九月四三七五、華比入正月八七五、華比正金對做九月四三七五、麥加利吃正月八七五、午收亦與早開同、下午大通麥加利均入正月卅元八七五、浙江麥加利互做十二月七五、浙江華比對做、又花旗進均正月八一二五、三井入十二月六八七五、安達三井對做正月七五、美豐出十二月六二五、花旗出十一月卅元半、中孚賣與美銀公司十月三七五、上海出十一二五、收市賣價卅元二五至五六二五、買價三七五至六八七五、又美金一元、合銀三兩三錢三分三厘三云云、</p>

<p>客銷略展釐價轉機</p>
<p>連日洋市步步猱升、且祗進不退、故價昂額達一分光景、形勢之驟、不遜於囊昔之跌風、但至前昨兩日略有曲折、而軒輊亦時有互見、祗以客胃銷場漸漸活動、恐市氣亦有進展之可</p>
<p>一時不易增勝耳、</p>
<p>厘有漲跌拆價仍軟　「洋厘」早市厘價爲六錢九分五厘一毫二忽半、較前日午市又高三毫七忽半、午市回落半厘、計爲六錢九分四厘六毫二忽半、結果較前日早市微昂一毫二忽半、「銀拆」早午兩市均開二分、較前日午市之白錯市面略覺優勝、劃頭加水四五分、銀根無優越之象、</p>

<p>紐約股市轉疲</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週一紐約股市、逾轉疲萎、早市曾有一度回漲、但曇花一現、午後因政局不定、美國鋼鐡公司報告惡劣、該股即遭傾出、而價亦轉跌、交易因都存觀望態度、頗覺呆滯、全日成交數共一百三十萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<p>棉市愈覺衰弱</p>
<p>棉市大虚、因天氣良好、利於新棉上市、美棉雖漲十磅音、但多於心理認爲大跌小回頭、散多又被其壓迫、市氣愈弱、信誠實出、空額增至十二萬担、而一般穩健者、以國内時期雖在出貨湧旺之際、連日跌風太猛、價格己迫近三十一兩外、皆不願新做空、且金價難小、滙兌見縮、惟大部份已傾向抛買云、</p>
<p>鄭標浮多了結　鄭標前市開盤、以美棉小漲、場中人心平澹、二三盤又跌、結果各月跌三錢、午後開盤、淨多了結、跌二三錢、二三盤回漲、結果各月漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計十萬○一千五百担、查賣出信誠八千担、餘昶四千七百担、天隆二千六百担、愼昌二千一百担、大豐二千七百担、買進賡豐六千四百担、吉豐二千九百担、長豐三千三百担、源大三千六百担、同興二千担、茲將收盤價錄下、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>河下米市轉定</p>
<p>滬南　昨日米市、各帮來船約抵廿餘號、城鄉店銷緣天時轉晴、兼屆出新之際、况北市較廉、是以去胃依然平常、做開厚粳行情頂定次疲、新粳來貨不少、銷塲仍呆價削角許、新杜洋尖來貨亦多、市面看小、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日裏路來船共有二十六七號、本街交易平淡常錫北粳及中關江陰宜興等米鄉胃略有應酬、價疲角許新粳市無榮辱參尖及茭白尖客胃仍懈本街走銷亦呆、</p>
<p>洋麥續小期麥難進展</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後　各月份市面、因洋麥報價又小一二三角致大部分人心、均受感觸、雖抛戶見暢、市氣不免暗淡、以洋麥來源未絶、廠家可以續定、標準過高、洋麥定購必愈湧人心之顧慮不無原因、故近小一二分遠小三分之　迨至下午開盤、因上午粉市之平穩、人心亦見安定、買賣兩寂、交易又不暢、觀察後步當以洋麥報價爲轉移也結果本月份不動、十月份小二分、十一月份小三分餘無比較、現麥因見交均寂、只包未開云、</p>
<p>粉市看長疲短俏</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼穩之象以洋麥報價、小去一二三角左右、故人心初見軟弱、較前日收價計小近分、惟以廠抛見寂、賣氣不暢以後各盤似見略俏、迨至下午初開各月份至十二月份、應抛仍寂、祗一二月份、福新稍有出檔、市氣平平至現洋麥之喊價、微好二三分大約二兩七錢七八分仍可訂購、　此情形、終看長疲短俏也、結果本月份較前日好二厘半、十月至十二月份均不動、一月份好二厘坐二月份未動云、</p>
<p>洋麥續有本街應酬</p>
<p>昨日湖南米曾有北帮問訊、但嫌市價不划結果仍無交易洋米祇有本街應酬北帮與漢口帮前日辦裝少數後須待試銷方有繼續　裝客化旣巳停頓、本街去胃亦不十分旺暢故市形又復帶軟、小絞米祗開五百包、價八元五角半至八元三角半已比前市拉小二三分西貢米市存不多、貨主不顧移脫、故市價仍可站立計開出一千包、價九元六角至九元四角云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥回軟</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週一（十九日）芝加哥小麥、先因利物浦市場堅挺而漲、後因出口需要不良回落、結果比上日跌○·六二五至○·八七五磅音、十七日成交數共二千萬蒲歇爾、茲將十九日行市列左</p>

<p>五月　五七·五○　跌○·七五○</p>
<p>糖市　粗砂白擯持未開</p>
<p>昨日糖市、荷糧標金雖均堅挺然以節後客銷尙未大起、市勢轉趨擯局、公會劃盤二十四號粗砂白、仍呌十四兩六錢、二十號中砂白呌十四兩零五分、均乏成交、查上週銷數、統共僅二萬二千餘色走場固見遜色也、建冰昨大來號開出鶴松白冰五十砠、每箱價爲十兩、又馬球冰數十箱、九兩九錢、獅球冰六十箱、九兩八錢所到高漳刁因各行尙在覆樣、須明後始可談價云、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>白廠經細銷漸起</p>
<p>昨日　外廠總　報尙未轉滬、洋莊觀望惟内地　廠開　冬綢之白廠經需要漸暢、茲以市盤回跌、紛起乘機抛　、計由杭　廠進上中身Ｂ字級十八至二十二條份滬白廠經四十包、價目五百三十五兩至五百七十五兩、湖綢廠明華等　中身Ｂ級十六至十八條份滬白廠經二十五包、價扯五百二十五兩、</p>
<p>里昂意絲價由漲轉疲</p>
<p>各級意絲每基羅均跌三四法郎</p>
<p>里昂生絲市場、近因日絲讓價傾銷、絲價均趨疲勢、意大利生絲亦以廠進轉懈、價雖立定、週一雙特號每基羅祗開三百三十八法郎、特號一百二十四法郎、上等一百零二法郎、各跌三四法郎云、</p>
<p>珍收貢熙價均趨跌</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪歙縣等路之珍眉貢熙綠茶、英俄兩莊、均有零星去胃、市商尙不十分寂寞惟因海外來價異常緊縮華商態度、堅軟不一、珍眉市盤、已較前見跌十餘兩、貢熙亦跌四五兩、至針眉秀眉等項、因存底己告枯薄、市面均能站定、此外祁門寗州紅茶、日來英銷完全停滯、恊助會亦觀望不進、市情至爲悲觀云、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>麥爾登呢銷動市堅</p>
<p>麥爾登呢、市情較平厚呢爲堅、去年售二兩零之貨、今庚開盤祗售一兩七八錢、近來則似有轉堅之象、每碼平均較開盤時價好起數分、蓋其市銷略動、大帮號衣齊選該料、因之公會上市氣節節上升、現顧全隆鏡花緣牌躉批售一兩七錢寗豐大石江一兩八錢七分半、華波聯歡圖一兩九錢半、德記杜蘭香爲三兩○五分、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>秋皮釘貶價五錢</p>
<p>昨日五金因客銷稍活、市情稍覺熱閙、新鉛絲·黃鋼絲·英鋼板·平白鐡·馬口鐡等莫不有連批開出、惟行情因成交額均鮮、故尙少變遷、惟靜極思動之秋皮釘行情、昨日驟然貶價五錢、計三分估二十二兩四分二十一兩、五分二十兩○五錢、六分二十兩○二錢半、查談交者有靑島·濟南·天津諸帮、長江一帶祗有零星買賣而已、聞上海各洋釘廠亦有秋皮釘出品消息、前途恐跌多而漲少也、</p>
<p>馬口鐡實銷又滯</p>
<p>節後五金市况依然有徘徊不前之勢、客銷仍多觀望、廠胃亦軟弱不多、是以市場除零星生意外、大宗買賣堪云毫無把握、雖久稱暢銷活潑一時之馬口鐡、最近亦因實銷停滯、市况亦十分衰弱、標準外强中乾、如九十磅英貨估十兩○二錢半、一百磅十二兩、美貨九十磅十三兩七錢半、一百磅十五兩二錢半二百磅正號美馬口鐡估三十兩、英貨估二十二兩、一百八十磅正號美貨估二十五兩、英貨二十兩○二錢半、會司鐡美貨開二十一兩二錢半、英貨開十兩○二錢半、三十五磅英美馬口鐡均各開三十九兩五錢、查以上各馬口鐡、每日成交祗有一百餘箱而已、不知市面冷落之一斑矣、</p>
<p>白鐡瓦新到千餘担</p>
<p>因現貨軋缺而趨俏之白鐡瓦、昨日市上頓無缺貨恐慌、據茶會消息、謂此貨新太古棧又裝到一千二百五六十担之多、致一時供過於求、人心大衰、標準因之亦見鬆動、如二十四號均估九兩二錢半、二十六號十兩零七錢半、二十八號十一兩二錢半、聞建築帮某某等號辦進二百餘担、而客帮銷塲未見進步云、</p>
<p>煤炭　國煤仍無起色</p>
<p>各種國産煙煤市况、近來又趨暗淡、每日交易、不過六七百噸、良由東煤湧到、削價侵銷所致、市場售開中岳塊八兩二錢半、石知浦八兩、神田塊六兩半、元山塊五兩二錢半、三礦撫順八兩七錢半、</p>
<p>柳江煤價亦疲</p>
<p>近來售開各種白煤、如紅崎·馬克·河南等貨、均受山西煤跌價影響、故盤子亦互相跌落、最近柳江煤價、亦被牽動、日昨市場售開、每噸僅十三兩七錢五分云、</p>

<h3>江南海塘善後工程記</h3>
<p>江南塘工善後委員會、於本年四月十一日成立、迄今將及半載、現在善後工程、業巳辦理就緖、定於本月二十四日二十五日招待各界參觀塘工、記者特先往該會訪問、記錄所聞於後、</p>
<p>海塘形勢　江蘇境内之江南海塘、起於常熟、經太倉·寳山·上海·川沙·南匯·奉賢·松江·至金山與浙江海塘相接而以太倉·寳山·松江·及上海市轄境内之海塘最爲緊要、蓋其他各縣塘外尙有淺沙爲護而此數縣海塘則處處與巨浪直接衝突太湖流域本係一長江口之三角形大冲積地故地形至爲卑濕、淸季海塘破時、海水曾直冲至蘇州一帶甚至浙江省内河水均帶鹹味、就上海市而論每年大潮汛時、潮水經過黃浦江多次曲折减却高度猶時時在浦灘一帶上岸、去年大水時各銀行倉庫均爲水没若海塘一坡海水奔騰而入、則全市不難見去年漢口景象也、江南海塘之在浙江境内者、卽所謂錢塘、係吳越錢武肅王所姑築、根基極好、歷朝均經入修、淸乾隆朝、即曾用三百萬兩大修一次、且近在浙江省會、民國以來、當局亦能注意、惟江蘇境内之一叚、則根基卽不良、近年益廢弛國民政府成立以來、則形式上專管之機關且無之、歲修之欵、虚列預算、從不實發、以致坦坡大半傾圮、　石幾同豁齒、去秋八月二十五六兩日之大風潮、爲多年所未有、出險者多處所幸因風向由東北轉成東南一線、危塘得以保存、否則必將全部崩潰、爲禍之烈、未知所止、</p>
<p>塘工會之組織　　去年塘工旣出險浦東同鄉會以切身利害關係、推　藕初·杜月笙·等前往勘查並通電呼籲、而銀行界及商會等、鑒於漢口水災之慘、亦羣起要求政府、切實修建塘工、於是江蘇省政府及上海市政府合　江南塘工善後委員會、聘鈕永建爲委員長穆藕初爲副委員長、沈昌爲秘書長、華楚傖·杜月笙·王一亨·張公權·林康侯·吳藕齋·等四十餘人爲委員、上海戰事停止後、即組織成立、並由委員會公推沈昌爲工程專門委員會主任、張效　·宋愷傳·施文冉·　丹　·等爲委員、負寄核計園工輕之全責、一面由省政府派宛開甲爲寳山叚工務處長、邱錫爵爲常太叚工務處長、徐百揆爲松江叚工務處長、市政府派張丹如爲高　工務處主任、戴兩竸爲吳淞工務處主任、分别詳勘、設計招商投標、於六月一日起分叚開工、</p>
<p>工程計劃　考中國海塘、以用大條石砌成　塘、名爲條石工者最爲堅固、如華享寳山石塘、歷久不壞、新式塘工、則用　筋混凝土築成之岸墻、外築石坦坡、本有條石之固、惜設計欠當、而又多偷工减料、轉不若舊式　石之堅固耐久、樁石工者於土塘之外　、砌大塊石、再於石塊之外打一丈八尺長之密樁一排、樁外再砌石塊、石外再打樁、欲其堅則可以多至四層、此次限於經費、僅築二層、惟選料極爲愼重、樁木則一律福建産之杉木、石料則一律寗波産之大塊石、間用蘇州金山石、原有鋼骨水泥岸墻、一律加用拉樁拉鐡鐺樑、並築封頭墻、外抛大石、　　工程預算及籌欵　江南海塘澈底修建、非二三千萬元不可、該會建議在江海關附微特捐、格於部議、未能實現、因擬先有治標計劃、計三百萬元、又以限於經費、忽促之間不能集此巨欵、而時間迫促、不能久待、於是擇念中尤急者、先行興辦預算八十萬元、計（一）高橋補救鐡筋混凝土新式工五十七丈、（二）高橋新築二樁二石及擺水壩工五百五十一丈、（）三寳山獅子林南叚二樁二石工六十七丈五尺、（四）寳山陳華浜二樁二石工一百二十二文、（五）寳山五岳塾二樁工石工一百四十五丈、（六）寳山薛家灘二樁二石工三百三十六丈、（七）寳山牛頭涇二樁二石工八十丈、（八）寳山北王廟二樁二石工二百五十五丈、（九）寳山軍事善後整理工程、（十）太倉閱兵台南北二樁三石工一百二十八丈二尺、（十一）太倉道堂廟水泥墻南北叚二樁三石工一百三十七丈、（十二）太倉道堂廟水泥墻外添抛塊石九十二丈、（十三）太倉道堂廟修築包頭澆砌塊石墻十二丈、（十四）太倉方家堰水泥墻南外整理坦坡添抛塊石一百另五丈（十五）太倉楊林口北二樁二石工二十丈、（十六）太倉軍事善後整理工程、（十七）松江第二叚二石工三十一文一尺、（十八）松江第三叚新工補充工程二百十丈、（十九）松江第四叚坦坡添抛塊石一百五十五文（二十）松江軍事善後整理工程、（二十一）常熟徐六涇口東二樁三石工五十丈、（二）十二）常熟徐六涇口西二樁三石工三丈、（二十三）常熟軍事善後整理工程、（二十四）楊林口南二樁二石工六十五丈、然卽此八十萬元、亦係虚擬、並無的欵、所幸政府賢明、省方特撥忙漕抵借券七十萬元、市方特撥碼頭捐、每月一萬元由該會穆副委員長及杜月笙·杜康侯·吳藴齋·沈立孫·諸委員分投向銀錢業抵借、而銀錢業亦深明大義、量力担任、集足六十五萬元復由張公權·杜月笙·金侯城·沈立孫諸君、向中央再三奔走、由鐡道部撥到補𦔳費十五萬元、賑務委員會恊𦔳八千元、中國紅十字會亦撥二千元、遂集合八十一萬元、較預算超過一萬元而工程用費因事事公開、遂得較預算爲廉、結果餘洋五萬三千餘元、適屆秋汛、省市金庫均無欵可撥、而防汛搶修需料甚殷、遂以餘欵悉數購料、而此項購料價格尤廉、較之例價低百分三十左右、</p>
<p>工程之督察　省市政府對於本屆塘工、均極注意、建設廳廳長董修甲、每月親到各縣視察、工務局沈局長亦不時蒞工督查、委員會方面除特派稽查十人、駐工常川稽察外、並由穆副委員長沈秘書長吳總稽查等、輪流到工督查故工程進行、極爲迅速、三個月得以完成、照例則至少須三年、始得完工云、</p>
<p>塘工之將來　塘工善後委員會、巳定本月底結束各工務處則繼續存在、受主管官廳之指揮監督塘工、能籌得巨欵、繼續興修、固爲上策、否則能年籌二三十萬元欵項、以事修補則二十年内不出巨險、若仍照往年泄沓之狀、則巨汛來時、仍難免危險云、</p>
<p>塘工委員會之辦公經費　塘工委員會因係義務性質故每月辦公經費、預算僅一千二百元、而　會特别撙節、一切開辦結束費用、均在經常費内開支、不另請欵、故該會六個月來、辦公經費所用不足七千元云、</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>八月春</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>秋海棠雖是草本，但在八月裏面，點綴得牆隅庭角和錦繡一般，料想春色滿園，不過爾爾，所以秋海棠又名八月春。</p>
<p>海棠自恨不能香，這是花的缺憾：無論木本的春海棠，草本的秋海棠，儘敎生的嬌麗，郤没有撲鼻的馨香。昔人說的生平三恨，第一根便是海棠無香，和那　魚多骨，曾子固不能作詩，合成三恨：但是，海棠並非眞個不能香，根據嶺南隨筆所記載：淸遠歸猿洞的秋海棠，肇慶羚羊峽的春海棠，都是芬芳撲鼻。可惜遠在嶺南，不能夠去欣賞一回，這也是一椿憾事</p>
<p>秋海棠旣稱斷腸花，又名相思草；這都是哀情小說中的材料；其實，草木無情，怎會斷腸，怎會相思，無非說說罷了。吾見漳州志，有這麽一段記載：丨秋海棠歲每生苗，其莖甚脆：葉背作紅亂紋，云是相思血。相傳昔人有以相思而噴血階下，遂生此花，故亦名相思草：云云。這一段文字，附會可笑：但是供給詩人吟詠的材料，郤和湘妃竹有同樣的趣味。</p>
<p>秋海棠有紅白二種，紅者嫩豔，白者雅潔；紅秋海棠可以製蜜，所有製法，載入慈航活人書。據云：用上白蜜一大杯，取紅秋海棠花片，　入蜜内，將花略搗，蒸曬數次，自爛如泥；其蜜色如海棠，或加入好芙蓉粉少許，光絶可愛，且免面皮凍裂。</p>
<p>周子說：菊，花之隱逸者也：牡丹，花之富貴者也：蓮，花之君子者也。我來加上一句：秋海棠，花之抗日者也。</p>
<p>秋海棠怎說抗日？這是有書爲證的；羣芳譜上紀載秋海棠性質，有這麽五個字：丨性好陰，惡日。爲這分上，我們對於八月春，合該行一個相當的敬禮。</p>
<h3>南北極</h3>
<p>— 俞人英</p>
<p>丨天上人間兩不同丨</p>
<p>塞外的旌旗飄蕩着，旗上滿染着血跡和泥沙。一隊隊的勇士，提着掛上剌刀的槍桿衝鋒！</p>
<p>南京路上，大減價的旗幟招展着；時代的士女們在這裏熙熙攘攘的經過。在她們靑春的心靈裏，帶着歡樂的影子！</p>
<p>·······················</p>
<p>塞外的羗管齊鳴，在肅瑟的秋風中；愈顯出勇士們的精神！</p>
<p>四馬路洋貨店的樓頭，康納脫吹着無聊的調子婦女們像潮水一班的洶湧着，手中提着包包的衣料：臉上浮現着搭着便宜貨的微笑！</p>
<p>······················</p>
<p>塞外的鐡甲車馳聘着，朝着我們的敵人進攻！摧毁了旭日的島旗，厮殺着大和的靈魂。</p>
<p>在上海每一條的馬路中，汽車像瘋狂般的開足速率。幸福的哥兒和小姐們，都在尋找着各自的娱樂。</p>
<h3>二十一年九月十八日悲憤成篇</h3>
<p>柱尊</p>
<p>國人驚相告。又是九一八。去年九一八。滿洲夜被奪。黨國諸要人。登壇慷慨說。誓將恢國權。不將土地割。今年九一八。寇認滿洲國。熱河日告急。敵機鳴軋軋。黨國諸要人。依然慷慨說。誓將失地復。僞國須討伐。去年忽今年。不見一卒發。明年九一八。不知如何說。强敵日憑陵。諸夏爭愈烈。豈特强藩分。中央亦自裂。口口呼同志。心心各斧鍼。敵勢如建瓴。我政紛如髮。國命胡能久。曜靈悲急節。不知九一八。能有幾次說。（却酬）</p>
<h3>發起人</h3>
<p>— 施爲烈</p>
<p>丨捐助義勇軍與購買跑馬票丨</p>
<p>受了良心的驅策，突然地神明内疚，我雖然家巳毁於一一八之役，可是目下還安樂地過我的措大生活，想到三次襲擊瀋陽的義勇軍，他們在槍林彈雨之下，爲祖國爭先，求民族生存，也就是以血肉之軀，給關内的同胞換條生路：我們丨關内的人民應該怎樣的給他們盡力，做他們有力的後盾，憑了這樣的觀念，在辦事室内，我發起募欵捐助東北義勇軍，數目鉅細不計，祗求樂助而巳但，結果，凄慘的結果，張說身邊不便，李說家用不夠，案有「小開」的綽號的陶，微笑地對我說：「省省吧，阿戇，有錢還不會到冠生園去買廣東月餅吃」。</p>
<p>今天收發處的林嘻嘻哈哈地走進我們的辦事室，精神百倍的說：「喂，啥人要發財？買跑馬票的時候又到了，誰要買的請答名付錢」</p>
<p>可羨的林呀，經了他這振臂一呼，杲然衆皆響應，張付五元，李也是五元，陶小開除了公股内搭八元外、另外又獨買二張，共計二十八元。</p>
<p>唉，天啊，發起人之幸與不幸也如是丨</p>
<h3>正楷活字版之創製者</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>丨名書師鄭午昌氏丨</p>
<p>印刷爲發展文明唯一之事業。我國古時，用以記事傳說者，初用皮漆，繼用竹册。秦漢以還，始有弲紙筆墨，然皆出於手寫。直至唐末，乃有雕版印刷，及宋畢昇出，發明泥鑄活字，始有活字版印刷。至於印刷用之字體，則亦隨時代而改停，漆書時代，多蟲文，竹册時代，多篆　，秦漢之間，篆隷並用，而隷不盛，以其較便而適用也。自是而後，由隷入楷，印刷字體，亦多出入於隷楷之間，遂形成所謂宋　。元明以後，除私家精刻多用當時通用之楷書外，其普通印刷，槪襲用宋體，未曾改進。故印體與寫體，别爲兩途，讀書與寫字，亦遂發生隔膜。改良印刷字體，在現代文化事業中，實爲萬不容緩之要圖。</p>
<p>老　鄭君午昌，善書能畫，著作等身，對於印刷事業，夙抱改進之宏願。在胡適之提倡白話文字之翌年，即致力於改良印刷字體，以求適合於現代文化之需求。書選取精整而適用之楷書一萬四千餘字，製造銅模，範鑄活字。午昌固寒素，又不喜張羅；屢以經濟困難作輟。然有志者，得人助，輒獲其友李祖韓陳小蝶諸君之共舉，現巳鑄成大小銅模六副，日夜澆鑄活字，名曰漢文正楷活字版，實行應用於印刷。蔡元培于右任諸老，皆極贊成之，謂爲中國印刷工具的新發明，現代文化事業之大草命。然午昌爲文化而奮鬭，蓋巳力竭聲嘶。故近爲人作畫，往往别署曰絲鬢散人。亦可知其辛苦矣。</p>
<h3>說部扶輪會銀絲（二十）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>「但是你的情操，還是和姑娘一樣；這十幾年裏，當然使你很頽廢而憂愁，我們從現在起，精神上不是重又恢復了靑春的意味麽？這兩縷銀絲，足以代表我們奮苦生活的過程，請你也送給我，作一個紀念吧！」袁團長伸手想去接，但是芬若却不曾給他。</p>
<p>「當然啊：但是我不能輕易地給你。」</p>
<p>「可是也要舉行什麽典禮」？袁團長說笑話，芬若也粲然地笑了。</p>
<p>「我想用這兩絲，代作絲線，繡在你的像上。年輕的袁先生，在我腦筋裏，以爲還是和以前一樣，怎料想得到袁先生兩鬢已蒼，假使把這兩絲添繡在這上面，不是格外像眞而有趣味麽？現在時間不早，請你立刻去到會參加紀念碑落成禮，我把你的像用架綳起來，添繡完成，在你散會的時候，我託繡貨店裏王先生送到會塲上來送給你。現在你麾該到會了，已經延遲得好久，熱心讚頌你的人，也許在暗暗駡你不守時間的信用了。凉茶再喝一杯？袁團長！</p>
<p>「不喝，我鎭討厭你呌袁團長與袁先生」！</p>
<p>「我眞弄不明白你新改的名字，一時口吃地呌不占口」。</p>
<p>「呌我從前的名字不好麽」？</p>
<p>「我們十多年不見面，你又當了團長，客氣一些不好麽」？</p>
<p>「你越客氣，我越受不住」。</p>
<p>「好！和甫，你眞的應該到會了，你不能聽我這一句話麽」？</p>
<p>「我怎麽改不聽你的話，但是你一定要告訴我再見的時間，越近越好」。</p>
<p>「我是料想到你一定再會來見我，在這上幾年裏，差不多每天都還麽想；現在已見到，將來我們自然一定有再見面的機會。約定了日期與時間，期待着是很乏味的，驟然的晤見，的確很有意思」。</p>
<p>「不，我們的談話，現在還不曾得到一個結果，我想明天凌晨再來，我自己來取這編像，請你不要敎旁人遞給我。</p>
<p>「你還是不要約期吧！淸晨，你應該督率你的部下去上早操。一個團長，起了大早去和女友會面，眞不成體統」。</p>
<p>「那麽今晚上吧」。</p>
<p>「更不成話：還是明天白天吧」。</p>
<p>「請你給我握一握手，許我從容給你說一聲再會」。</p>
<p>「好，我們明天再會」！芬若伸出那肥白而没有骨骼的右手，還帶着甜蜜的笑。袁團長緊緊的握了，囁嚅地說：「芬十幾年没有得到這樣可愛的塲地了，再會吧，明天再」</p>
<p>會吧，從今希望你離開憂愁與煩悶，因爲你的靈魂是這樣聖潔與美麗，芬，吾會吧」！</p>

<h3>韓劉之戰</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>韓劉之戰，性質莫名，突然發生，未窺眞相，惟國際形勢，非常緊張，日本方才承認僞國，又擬進窺熱河，外患方興，内戰復作，國家不幸，尙何待方，</p>
<p>此次戰因，據韓電所稱，因劉珍年借名籌餉，暴斂橫徵，有匪不剿，反加阻止，惟此種罪狀，我輩一時亦無從加以批評，不過外禍未戢於疆塲，黃池又起於國内，無論理由若何充分，聞之殊覺駭然，</p>
<p>惟更端言之，國家養兵，原以衛國東北事變，已迄一年，非但關外失地，寸土未恢，而熱河形勢，轉趨嚴重，兵不衛國，兵將安用，現在韓劉之爭，無論孰勝孰負，結果總可解决其一部分，</p>
<p>前日廢止内戰大同盟，在滬開會，通電全國，制止息爭，而曾未多時，戰復起，可知宣言决不見效，出血方肯干休，與其隱忍而各相猜忌，不若火併而一决雌雄，倒也爽快，</p>
<p>「不打不成相識」江湖固有名言，試看歷屆戰爭，結果都成親善，先例可舉，更僕難終，以此推之，戰亦非禍，更聞一言，十九路軍，戰蹟卓著，經騐所得，其功自殊，戰固終凶，不戰亦難立國，戰之可也，</p>
<p>或謂外禍之來，由於内戰，内戰不戢，禍必益深，不知頻年内戰，兄弟鬩牆，人不亡我，我將自亡，生命付諸砲火，財産盡於轉輸，如此國家，其何能國，</p>

<p>愁絶西風料峭天，强鄰侵犯竟年年，中宵拂拭劉琨劍，永夜低徊祖逖鞭，童稚皆知亡國恨，商民速助義軍捐，金甌已破誰能復，怕見中秋月又圓。</p>
<h3>偶成</h3>
<p>窗欞生虚白，林間喧宿鳥，樹頭敗葉聲，秋風戰勝了。</p>

<p>秋風方瑟瑟，秋扇乃棄捐，舉首望庭月，月影正團圓。</p>

<h3>染色如何可以不褪？</h3>
<p>— 黄禺成</p>
<p>丨答浦東盛三民君并告經營印染事業者丨</p>
<p>本月九日我在本刋發表了一篇「織物印花法」，竟能引起讀者盛三民君的注意，特地來函和我研究；我本想直接寫一封信去答覆盛君，但念及我國實業萎敗，科學落後，也許有和盛君發生同樣疑問的，不如抽暇寫這一篇短文，藉增刋科學欄内揭載，一得之愚，不敢秘而不宣，尙希高明有以敎我！</p>
<p>現在各染坊内所用的顔料，多爲直接性鹽基性及酸性的三種。這三種顔料以酸性顔料爲最易褪色，直接性顔料較好；鹽基性顔料若加入單寗酸或銻鹽類溶液，還須印染得法，或可暫時不褪，然絶不能保持永久：且多少都要褪一點的。倘使方法不善，那就格外要褪色了。</p>
<p>因此褪色與否，完全係顔料的問題。若要永不褪色，則必須用下面的三種顔料：</p>
<p>Ａ納夫得爾顔料，</p>
<p>Ｂ陰丹士林顔料：</p>
<p>Ｃ阿果若林顔林。</p>
<p>如用上面三種顔料印染，一定可以經久不褪，得到滿意的結果。不過印染的方法，又與用直接性鹽基性酸性三種顔料印染時不同了。</p>
<p>關於這種不同之點，固然不是幾句話可以述盡，且全憑空言而毫無經騐也是不能瞭解，最好請好志者得暇到我們上海印染公司的工廠裏去實地參觀，才可以明白。</p>
<p>我現在就在上海印染公司裏服務，這公司的規模　不很大，但可算是國内唯一的國貨工廠，所有出品也很得國人的贊揚。如蒙同志駕臨參觀，便可知其詳細，恕我不再嘵舌了丨</p>

<p>原振止君之意，我國之不能强盛，實由於科學不倡明，科學之不倡明，由於人民知識程度之低弱，民知之低弱，由人民對於學間欠下工夫，欲人民多下工夫，則星期休假之宜廢除尚矣。吾意異乎是：觀夫各國之行星期制者，其人民之知識不見幼劣，且屢有人才輩出，爲人類造福，證之振止君所謂宗敎色彩最濃厚之某帝國主義，尤爲明顯丨按此可知科學之不倡明，非星期休假爲害之故也，實由一般對星期日之處置不得其當耳。</p>
<p>學校果眞廢除星期休假，實際上對於學生非唯無益，且爲有害。蓋學生中之天性，有聰穎者，有低能者。能聰頴者，每日所受之功課，固能逐日解答，而低能者則勿如也。於是低能者利用星期日之暇，多下工夫於功課，以追隨聰</p>
<p>活的功課。</p>
<p>於敎員方面若無星期，則生活甚感乏味，後之擇業者視爲敎育界爲畏途矣。茲錄蘇俄各報紀載採用不斷工作週之影響於下：可作旁證也。</p>
<p>突得報之一段論述云：</p>
<p>「改舊制爲不斷工作週的新制，自不免引起穩健工人之激烈反對，···老年婦女反對尤烈，彼等聲言必須以禮拜日爲休息日：得與其丈夫同遊同樂……」</p>
<p>夷隨威斯提亞報曾載：</p>
<p>「一年輕工人說：「母親休息於第一天，父親休息於第二天，兄弟休息於第三天，我休息於第四天，余等將何能安心工作。」………鐮錘工人答眞理報訪員之問曰：「今後吾等將永無休息之樂乎。當我等之妻在工廠，子女在學校，朋友皆不能來訪，余等將百無聊賴，惟有入政府經營之茶館，坐以待日終，…」吾意以爲改革七日周制可，絶對廢除則不可也。至於若何改革，讓諸海内專家從詳討研也。</p>
<h3>良鄉　政</h3>
<p>星的問題</p>
<h3>一個男人愛了兩個女人的時候</h3>
<p>— 則李</p>
<p>一個男人愛了兩個女人的時候，假使他認爲戀愛是高尙的，純潔的，那嗎他一定要在這兩者之間選擇一個比較適合，比較眞切的來做他終身伴侶；而决不肯等到兩個女人同樣地對他達到最高熱度時所發生的不幸的來臨。反轉來一個野心家同時周旋在兩者之間，他時刻在患得患失，甚至於難吃難捨：最終，不是對方的不幸，就是他自己的失敗。</p>
<p>Ｌ因爲在學校時代的活動，先後和Ｃ，Ｙ都認識了。在長期間的經過以後，都發生了高度的熱情，在兩個女人方面，　各自曉得在自己以外還有一個爲他所着戀着的。</p>
<p>Ｙ是一個中産階級而失了父親的女子，白髮老母，時刻在希望着她得到一位如意郎君。當然Ｌ在學校出來以後，是得着相當的地位了：而他的翩翩風度，尤其使老人看了有趣。因爲老人的意旨所在，這位女士一心向着的進攻了，並且很容的他們發生了肉體Ｌ關係，</p>
<p>一個女人到把肉體供給了對方以後，總認爲這事是鐡鑄定了：但在這時候，他却絶對不提及婚娶的話。從幾次心頭小鹿七上八下過後，她終於把這問題提出了，她所有把握的，是她比Ｃ多一層肉體的關係，一翻温巧的要求，以爲無疑的他是很輕快地摟着她表示無限的同情。然而，他的答覆却只是：「我覺得現在還没有到時候。」</p>
<p>她當然感覺到這種答覆的原因所在，終於覺到這環境的可怕：怨恨，嫉妬充滿了她的内心，她决然地出走了。</p>
<p>一封表示犧牲，無限幽怨的信呈到Ｌ的面前的時候，她巳走到不知去向了。這至少是一種責任，對於她的出走，當然他要出力的找尋。經過兩天的奔走，却還是影踪毫無，而他來告訴我了。我給他一個普通的辦法丨登報啓事：一切問題，且等她回來了再講。同時，我也要問問他的意思究竟怎樣，這可妙極了。他的回答是：</p>
<p>「我現在不過是被良心驅使着，找得着找不到都没什麽要緊，反正我總找過了。至於她，在認識我的時候，就知道有一位Ｃ，而她始終向我走來，給我始終在徘徊歧路的狀態中。雖說她是和我發生了肉的關係，她還不是一樣解决了性慾問題，她决不能拿這來恐嚇我，尤其是她的出走，老實說，我没什麽對不住她，她就永不回來，我也只算丢掉一件平常的東西，没有什麽，毫没有什麽？」</p>
<p>「那嗎Ｃ，現在怎樣呢？」我問</p>
<p>「唉，這可難了，她到個把禮拜没信了。但是我完全是爲的Ｙ，不然的話，我就呌她來跟我同居，也不是什麽難的事！」</p>
<p>停了一會，他又說：</p>
<p>「澈底講一句，許多的女人，同時在蠱惑着幾個男子，最後只能嫁給其中的一個：其餘，都要嘗着失戀的滋味。你想，多少靑年爲此而墮落，自殺：所以我現在在兩個女人中間，丢去一個，並不算一回什麽事，並且也可說是代表一般男人給她們一個報復，不過呢，我也恐的到後來是兩頭勿着實呵！」</p>
<p>在這裏，我有感想了：</p>
<p>對一個曾經和自己發生過肉體關係的女子的失踪，不但没有　惜，還說是替一般男人的報復：一個女人爲着自己而冒險出走，這種良心上的責備，也總算不輕了吧！就不以愛的立塲來講，至少也有一些同情之心，而他，還是在患得患失。「戀愛」，這驅人的名詞啊丨</p>
<p>我們爲許多失戀的靑年男子們痛心過，前程遠大的靑年們，這稀小的女人問題，是值不得你犧牲一切的。現在，脆弱的女人的心呀，你喪失了肉體，摧毁了心靈，快點回來吧！你不值得爲一個以你的肉體爲標的的享樂主義的男人而犧牲啊！回來吧，Ｙ女士！</p>
<p>黑幕</p>
<h3>花會之毒</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>轉進小衖口，兩旁擠滿了人頭；我以爲又是爲了一枚銅元打破頭的事情發生，正在人叢中推湧前進，只聽見每一個人的口腔中發出「來了，來了，」的聲音，從語調上推測像盼望了好久的東西，剛才姗姗而來，時間上没有我猜想的餘閒，一輛脚踏車從我身後駛來，「ＸＸＸ」是那人的報告，混亂是兩旁人頭的騷動，我終於知道花會又在活動了，　　兩個像娘姨似的中年婦人，很得意的在我前面走</p>
<p>「你打進多少？」一個問·</p>
<p>「不多，打怕了，只打了三千」，一個答·</p>
<p>「我對你說那個死鬼靈的，只打了三千，我總共打了十五千哩！這一回不翻本，我也要投黃浦了·」說罷一個得意的微笑·</p>
<p>她們還要講求夢時的鬼話构已到了家門，所以没有領敎他們的藝術，</p>
<p>花會之害，谁麕都知道，牠搜刮勞工的汗血錢，據說九枚銅元可以賠一塊錢，何怪無知婦女，樂此不捲，但是開花會筒的大亨，洋房和包車那裏來的，於是一般抱僥倖心的人從九枚銅元打起而至十五千，她們甚至以生命相博，上述的娘姨說這一回不翻本，也要投黃浦嗎？我雖然見過報上公安局的申令，何以不見學實消滅這花會之毒呢？</p>

<h3>National Crisis and the Conflict Between Han and Liu</h3>
<p>By Zi</p>
<p>The conflict between the armies of Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian in Shandong occurred in the few days around the anniversary of the national crisis. At a time when the hearts of the entire nation were deeply stirred by the anniversary of the national crisis, feeling resentment towards the powerful aggressors externally and grief over the fate of the country internally, startled and vigilant, and suffering immense pain, an internal war sufficient to endanger the nation suddenly erupted before our eyes. The feeling of sorrow and disappointment is beyond the ordinary, as it should be. However, if the people of the country could cast aside superficial phenomena and conduct a thorough observation from the root, then they should know that there is something they can do about the situation. Grief and disappointment are not the proper attitudes; fundamentally effective elimination is the most appropriate approach.</p>
<p>Han and Liu, being in a position where the national crisis is still deeply felt, and having a conscience, cannot possibly be unaware that internal war must not be reignited. Their stationed areas have complex relationships with the Japanese. Forced by circumstances, they cannot suppress their ambition to launch an internal war. Yet, disregarding everything, they recklessly launched it. There must be a driving force that impelled and coerced them, clouding their minds and fueling their aggression. This goes without saying. Given the magnitude of this event and the complexity of the relationships involved, we cannot make definitive statements about its unique driving force today, before the inside story has been revealed. However, judging from the general nature of internal wars in China, we can observe that the driving force is still likely the stimulation of the desire for a better life for the soldiers. Shandong province has 107 counties, but over 20 counties are not under the control of the provincial government, resulting in the provincial government losing one-fifth of its tax revenue. Although Han Fuju, as a military man serving as chairman, is known as virtuous and intelligent, he cannot help but be stimulated by the desire to expand his territory and increase his revenue. Expanding territory and increasing revenue are the desires for a better life for the soldiers. Liu Zhennian, as a division commander, has become an independent force in the north. To maintain his power, he must expand his army. To expand his army, he must plunder the people's wealth. Not satisfied with local plundering, he is inevitably stimulated by the desire to develop outward. Developing outward is also the desire for a better life for the soldiers. With the conflict between the desires for a better life on both sides, the cause of the internal war arises. With the intensity of the conflict between the desires for a better life on both sides, the outbreak of internal war, even in the midst of a national crisis, and despite other dangerous circumstances, is something they have no time to consider.</p>
<p>The desire for a better life possesses an innate and immense power, which cannot be overcome by personal reason. When it is intensely stimulated, the harm cannot be deterred, and life is not valued. This can be proven by any social or biological phenomenon we choose. Han Fuju has governed Shandong for many years and has a good reputation. He is considered a relatively virtuous military man in the country. Liu Zhennian has received education at a military academy and is not comparable to an uneducated soldier who does not understand reason. Yet, they could not tolerate even a moment longer and resorted to violence in the midst of a national crisis, causing sorrow and disappointment among the people and providing an excuse for the enemy to publicize their propaganda, leaving diplomatic representatives unable to defend the country. It is a matter of the heart and reason.</p>
<p>The above is not intended to criticize the essence of Han and Liu's actions, nor does it mean that the people of the country can allow this kind of event to arise and disappear on its own without being eliminated. It is precisely to clarify the nature of the event and to seek appropriate methods of elimination. What is the method of elimination? Concentrate the hearts and strength of the people and create a greater force sufficient to control everything. In ordinary times, use this force to warn the military, so that their improper desire for a better life is feared and不敢develop. When internal war is about to break out, use this force to suppress both sides, so that they dare not launch it lightly, and seek a fundamental solution. The military's desire for a better life has a tremendous impact on their personal behavior. If the people cannot concentrate their hearts and strength to provide serious supervision and restraint, then events caused by the military's desire for a better life will forever put the country in an irretrievable situation. Using force to counteract force is the most appropriate method. The unprecedented national crisis cannot prevent the outbreak of internal war in Shandong because the strength of the national crisis is not enough to suppress it.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Stops the Conflict Between Han and Liu</p>
<p>Telegram orders both sides to cease military actions and await central government officials to handle the situation</p>
<p>Han's army captures Yexian County, Liu's army largely retreats to Laiyang and Qixia</p>
<p>The frontline battles in Jiaodong were suspended last night due to heavy rain</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the evening of the 20th, the Executive Yuan telegraphed Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian, stating briefly, "At a time when foreign powers are pressing and the nation's survival is at stake, the sudden outbreak of war in Shandong has shocked the entire country and made us a laughingstock to foreigners. It is hoped that you will consider the nation's difficulties and immediately cease military actions, awaiting the central government's dispatch of officials to handle all matters." (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Han-Liu conflict, the Executive Yuan held a meeting on the 20th, during which He Yingqin reported on the severity of the situation. It was decided to send telegrams to Han and Liu, strictly prohibiting military actions and awaiting the central government's dispatch of officials to handle the matter. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Han's representative in Nanjing, Tang Xiang, received a telegram from the Shandong Provincial Government on the night of the 19th, stating that the turmoil would not escalate and was expected to be quelled within a few days. The representative then visited He Yingqin on the 20th and presented the original telegram for his review. Liu's representative in Nanjing, Yang Lichuan, also visited He Yingqin this afternoon, reporting on Liu's telegram stating that he had complied with the order to retreat his troops and requested instructions on all matters on his behalf. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang expressed to Jiang Bocheng that he had no opinion on the Shandong affair and would follow Jiang's intentions. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Han's Army Adopts a Circuitous Strategy</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important figure received a telegram from Jinan stating that Qiao Lizhi's division from northern Shandong was divided into five trains on the 19th, passing through Jinan to Jiaodong. Han's army has about 36,000 troops on the Yantai-Weihai Road, and about 27,000 troops in the Pingdu area. Yexian has been captured, and most of Liu's army has retreated to Laiyang and Qixia. Fierce battles are expected in those two places within a day or two. Han's forces are adopting a circuitous strategy, having dispatched a large force north from Haiyang to encircle the rear of Laiyang, cutting off the connection between Liu's army and the rear of Muping, in order to achieve an pincer effect. Han has gone to the front lines several times to command. The administrative office will move to Changyi within days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A source from a certain quarter received a telegram from Jinan stating that Liu's troops are retreating in succession, and Han's army has advanced to the outskirts of Yexian city, but one unit of Liu's troops is still stationed inside Yexian city, etc. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Han Fuju's troops occupied Pingdu at 1:00 PM on Sunday. Liu's army retreated to Yexian without a fight. Han's army intends to attack. Shen Honglie's attitude is questionable, with Qingdao people believing he is leaning towards Han's side. He has now led the Bohai Fleet out of Laoshan Bay. It is rumored that his purpose is to blockade Yantai, Weihai, and Longkou, to prevent Liu Zhennian from escaping when defeated. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yantai) According to responsible sources, Han's army has halted its advance towards Laiyang. Liu's army, led by Bao Yisan (transliteration), is currently leading troops from Fushan to intercept them. Liu's main force is currently gathered in Laizhou, where there are no signs of battle. Yantai remains peaceful, and all troops have been dispatched westward. The people are now calm and self-reliant. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to external Shandong news, Han Fuju has gone to Shahe to supervise the battle, and Liu Zhennian has also personally gone to Laizhou to command military operations. Liu's subordinate, Bao Yisan, denied the order to retreat, saying that the troops stationed in Yantai are determined to fight. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Frontline Battles Halted Due to Heavy Rain</p>
<p>Weixian Heavy rain began yesterday at 4 PM, followed by strong winds at 7 PM. Both sides on the Jiaodong front lost their freedom of movement due to the rain, and the battles have halted. (20th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Weixian Han Fuju, who avoids battle and nourishes his strength, ordered 5,000 troops waiting in Jinan last night to advance along the Xiaoqing River towards Yangjiaogou. He also ordered 2,000 troops stationed in Qingzhou to conduct a forced march by land, combining them with the previous troops to concentrate at Yangjiaogou. Under the cover of Shen Honglie's Bohai Fleet, he plans to use requisitioned civilian ships to land in front of the enemy at Longkou, capturing Zhifu in one fell swoop. (19th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) A certain person who personally inspected the Jiaodong battles and went to the front lines returned to Qingdao yesterday. According to him, the conflict between the people's militia and Liu Zhennian led to the expansion of the conflict between the Han and Liu armies. Han Fuju mobilized 30,000 troops, attacking from Changyi, Gaomi, and Jiaozhou.</p>
<p>His troops in Gaomi occupied Pingdu at noon on the 18th, joining the main force of the Weixian troops, and advancing towards the Shuhe area. They have also occupied Yexian. The Jiaozhou troops are currently attacking Laiyang. It is expected that the two armies will open fire today or tomorrow. There is internal turmoil in Liu Zhennian's army, and the local people have a very strong aversion to them. If the superior Han army begins a vigorous attack, Liu's army may not be able to hold out for long. Furthermore, the Jiaoji Railway is very stable and no different from usual. (20th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Military Affairs Commission Dispatches Officials to Shandong for Investigation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission dispatched officials to Shandong on the 20th to investigate the Han-Liu conflict, in order to handle it. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang replied to Jiang Bocheng, hoping that Zhang would mediate between both sides on the Shandong affair, so as to prevent it from escalating. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The central government telegraphed Beiping tonight, dispatching two special commissioners to Jinan and Yantai separately to investigate the truth. They departed secretly today. At the same time, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent an urgent telegram to Han and Liu, ordering them to immediately cease military actions and await central government orders. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The report that Jiang Bocheng is going to Shandong is unconfirmed. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important figure in Hankou telegraphed Beiping, hoping that the Military Affairs Commission and the Political Affairs Committee would take responsibility for mediating the Shandong war. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian Asks Shen Honglie to Mediate</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Realizing that the situation is deteriorating day by day, Liu Zhennian telegraphed Shen Honglie yesterday, asking him to mediate a compromise with Han Fuju. Shen sent a representative to Jinan last night to inquire about Han's intentions. (20th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu's Army Decides to Retreat and Gather Around Muping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhennian, believing that his own military strength is insufficient to resist Han, has decided to retreat and gather around Muping to resist. The city wall of Muping has been raised by five feet, and a large amount of grain has been stockpiled on Liu Gong Island, sufficient for one year's use. Han has purchased a large number of aircraft, which are being transported. Liu's army officers are all from Nangong and have only received a few months of military training. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters Cables Accusations Against Liu Zhennian</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters telegraphed the Central Executive Committee on the 19th, stating that Liu Zhennian occupies eastern Shandong, disrupts administration, and obstructs bandit suppression. Chairman Han had no choice but to use force. With the national crisis worsening daily, and concerns about the security of North China, political and military unity is essential. To resist foreign aggression, internal stability is the priority, and the division of territory cannot be tolerated. If Liu Zhennian cares about the difficulties facing the nation, he should realize his error and not resist stubbornly. Therefore, this telegram is presented to your committee, ordering Liu Zhennian to return the administration of eastern Shandong counties to the Shandong Provincial Government, and his troops to be handed over to the central government for investigation. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Five Shandong Provincial Departments Announce Liu's Crimes</p>
<p>(Jinan) Five provincial departments have announced the crimes of Liu in a telegram, signed by the five department heads, Provincial Committee member Zhang Yun, Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, and Civil Affairs Department Head Li Shuchun, addressed to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, the Military Affairs Commission, and Jiang, outlining Liu's alleged offenses: 1. monopolizing civil administration; 2. disrupting finances; 3. undermining construction; 4. destroying education; 5. stifling industry. It also mentions the events of 1919, in which Liu vacillated, showing disregard not only for the provincial government but also for the central government for a long time. They stated that in order to uphold national law and protect the lives of the people, they could only request the central government to promptly issue a clear order to strip Liu Zhennian of all his current and concurrent positions, and order the Third Route Army to strictly arrest and investigate him, in order to deter others from following his example and to serve as a warning. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui and Others Discuss Mediation Measures</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui visited Jiang Bocheng this afternoon to discuss mediation measures for the Shandong affair. Zhuang Bocheng plans to visit Zhang Xueliang tonight to seek his opinion on the Shandong war. Zhuang Bocheng will not leave Beiping until Jiang and Zhang have agreed on a plan. Liu Xizhong planned to return to Jinan last night, but after boarding the train, he disembarked temporarily due to important matters requiring consultation and returned to the Litong Hotel. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui said that at this time of national crisis, every bullet and every soldier should be cherished and not sacrificed in internal wars. We should cultivate our strength and turn our guns to attack outwards. He only learned of the Shandong affair after it broke out. If he had discovered it beforehand, mediation would have been easier, but now that it has happened, it is particularly difficult. Although Shandong has been recovering somewhat in recent years, the wounds have not healed, and it cannot withstand another internal war, causing further suffering to the people. After he telegraphed Han to mediate, Han replied, expressing appreciation for his insights and requesting his continued guidance. He will now telegraph Han and Liu again, asking them to immediately cease military actions. Once his illness has improved slightly, he will go to Shandong to thoroughly mediate between the two sides. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Representative of Liu Zhennian Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative, Yang Lichuan, issued a statement to the press, stating that Chairman Han's deliberate attack on our division was carefully prepared in advance, as the facts demonstrate. As for the announced accusations against our division commander, there is no need to refute them for the time being, as all internal wars have such articles as a pretext. If our division were truly as Han described in his telegram, then he should have requested the central government to handle the matter, which would have been proper. By not doing so and lightly initiating war, his disregard for the central government and violation of the nation's anti-war sentiment are obvious. Master Liu recently sent a telegram to Nanjing expressing his willingness to make concessions and has withdrawn from Weixian to Yexian, a distance of about 200 li, unwilling to see internal war again, making us a laughingstock to domestic and foreign observers. If the central government orders us to withdraw from Jiaodong, we will absolutely comply. If Han's army violates the central government's orders, does not cease military actions, and continues to advance step by step, then when our division has nowhere to retreat, Han will bear full responsibility for the future escalation of the war. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhennian sent a public telegram from Yantai, saying that he had telegraphed Jiang and He Yingqin to report that Han's troops were continuing to advance and to request instructions on strategy. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>National Salvation Army Recaptures Jinxi</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing Personally Commands Operations on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Meng Zhaoyan's Troops on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Line Confront Japanese Troops</p>
<p>(Beiping) The joint forces of the National Salvation Army under Wang Xianting, Zhang Mingwu, and others engaged about a thousand enemy troops at Qingshilingzi on the 17th and encountered local puppet police at Tazigou. On the morning of the 18th, they recaptured Jinxi, and the puppet police chief Cao Rongxuan and all the traitors were annihilated, seizing dozens of guns. Several Japanese planes then flew over to drop bombs and strafe with machine guns, causing panic among the people. Our army granted their request and withdrew to a safe defense zone at noon, awaiting an opportunity to attack Jinzhou. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the 18th, after Zhu Jiqing personally went to the front lines to carry out a general offensive by various units of the National Salvation Army in western Liaoning, fierce battles have been raging everywhere. From Suizhong, Xingcheng, Jinxi, and Jin County to Yixian, Beizhen, Heishan, and Tongliao, no fewer than 150,000 people have participated. Prior to this, Zhu held a military conference in a certain place, attended by various generals. Indignant at the blatant recognition of the puppet state by the Japanese, they all expressed their determination to fight the enemy to the death. (20th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Frequently Reconnoiter Over the Rehe Region</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important figure from Rehe staying in Beiping said that Japanese aircraft frequently fly over Rehe for reconnaissance. According to a telephone report from Chifeng County, Japanese aircraft flew from Lingyuan to Chifeng on the 6th for reconnaissance for about an hour without causing any damage. Due to frequent reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft in various counties of Rehe Province, all government agencies and residents have dug shelters to avoid danger. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Meng Zhaoyan's Troops Prepare for a Counterattack</p>
<p>(Beiping) Meng Zhaoyan, commander of the First Detachment of the National Salvation Army, telegraphed Beiping, stating that on July 18, twelve aircraft arrived in Chaoyang, Rehe, dropping over a hundred bombs and destroying dozens of houses, wounding dozens of people. At the same time, a Japanese armored car drove to Nanling and strafed with machine guns, but was repulsed by our troops. On August 19, the army dispatched a hundred or so combat soldiers and one armored car to occupy the entire Jinzhou-Chaoyang line. After the Rehe army resisted at Nanling, our troops blew up the Liuhe Bridge in the Chaoyang Temple section with explosives, cutting off their retreat. The enemy troops retreated hastily, with dozens of enemy soldiers killed and the car and gun shattered. We seized twenty enemy weapons. Our troops suffered over ten casualties. The Chaoyang Road is currently closed to traffic. Our headquarters is located at Hangu Village in Chaoyang, preparing for a counterattack. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Protest to Japan</p>
<p>Note Delivered to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Requests Prompt Consideration</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Also Submits a Note</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative to the Council of the League of Nations, Yan Huiqing, delivered a note to the President of the Special Assembly of the League of Nations, Hymans, protesting Japan's official recognition of "Manchukuo." The main points of the note were as follows: "The compromise between Japan and the puppet government is merely following the precedent it set with Korea and establishing a protectorate in Manchuria as a stepping stone for future annexation. According to the treaty between Japan and 'Manchukuo,' Japan has the right to station troops in Manchuria to protect the area. If so, then danger will soon arise to general peace, especially to peace in Liaodong. It is clear that after occupying Manchuria, the Japanese military used force to create a puppet organization. The Chinese delegation has repeatedly stated the true nature of this organization in its communications to the League of Nations. What Japan has done is a policy of violating treaties, disregarding the obligations stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty, the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Japan's recent actions are the means to complete this policy. The League of Nations dispatched an investigative mission to establish a fair solution based on the contractual obligations of the parties, members of the League of Nations, and the United States. However, Japan has already preemptively rejected the report submitted by the League of Nations' investigative mission. The Chinese government has consistently declared its willingness to discuss a fair solution to the dispute, believing that accepting the League of Nations' investigative report is essential to achieve this goal. However, the Chinese government observes that the time has come for the League of Nations to consider appropriate measures to ensure that the sanctity of treaties binding all its members is upheld, and that the obligations to maintain China's territorial integrity, political independence, and resist foreign aggression are particularly important. When the General Assembly extended the time limit set by Article 12 of the Covenant, the President of the General Assembly declared, 'The General Assembly decides to allow statements on all actions. The parties concerned shall endeavor to avoid all actions that may hinder the work of the investigative mission and hinder the efforts of the League of Nations to resolve the dispute and make them unsuccessful.'

<p>Under Japanese Direction</p>
<p>Puppet Regime Publicly Sells Opium</p>
<p>Implementing a Policy of Poisoning</p>
<p>(Changchun) In order to make up for the current financial deficit and military expenditure shortages, the "Manchukuo" puppet organization adopted the advice of the Japanese and decided to publicly sell opium. Today, the Japanese formulated all the laws for the public sale of opium and announced them in the name of the puppet ruler. There are three reasons for the Japanese coercing the puppet regime to publicly sell opium: (1) Because the Japanese have no source of funds for their invading military expenses, they want the puppet state to be fully responsible for all military expenses of the Japanese army stationed in Manchuria in the name of jointly bearing the national defense of Manchukuo, so they are planning to publicly sell opium as a source of funds. (2) Using the public sales agency as a tool to place Japanese people. Originally, most of the Japanese vagrants in Manchuria made a living by selling drugs, so the implementation of public opium sales can provide many opportunities for the Japanese. (3) To exhaust the vitality of the 30 million Chinese people in Manchuria, so as to make them permanent slaves of the Japanese. (20th China United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Various Countries on the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Inconvenient to Conduct Negotiations</p>
<p>Navigation Rights Should Be Remedied by Merchant Ships Themselves</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The puppet organization has declared the independence of the Northeast Customs, and all foreign ship navigation permits issued by the Chinese government are invalid. From now on, merchant ships from all countries except Japan have lost their right to navigate to Yingkou, Dalian, and other places in northern China. The merchant shipping companies of various countries in Shanghai have telegraphed their respective governments and diplomatic authorities, requesting serious negotiations. According to external sources, the merchant shipping companies of various countries have requested their governments to strive for navigation rights in northern China and have received instructions from their national governments, stating that since the various countries cannot recognize the puppet organization, they cannot directly negotiate navigation rights with the puppet state. The merchants should engage in de facto direct negotiations with the local authorities as a temporary remedy and declared that the negotiations of the merchants with them are not a legal issue and are unrelated to the recognition of the puppet organization.</p>

<p>Huang Shaoxiong Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</p>

He had not heard of the rumors of Guangdong organizing a military branch or that it was just a proposal. President Wang went to Mogan Mountain for rest, and he planned to meet him in Shanghai. Mr. Wang's illness is indeed very serious, and outside speculation is not credible. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong discussed returning to Guangxi to discuss with local authorities the improvement of Guangxi's production methods. He met with the military and political leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi one by one. They believed that in the face of national crisis, there should be no more disputes within the country. Although there were reports of people advocating convening the Third Plenary Session in Guangdong when he arrived in Hong Kong, it was opposed by the majority and dismissed. Guangdong and Guangxi are not irresponsible in suppressing the communists. The Guangdong army moved the teams stationed in the east and west of the Beijiang due to the emergency in Beijiang and then withdrew the teams originally stationed elsewhere to their original defenses after the communist bandits were defeated. Therefore, they are not failing to put in effort to suppress the bandits. Currently, the Guangdong army is still suppressing the lurking bandits in southern Jiangxi. He met with Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong, who had a calm attitude towards the current situation, and all kinds of rumors are not true. Li Renzhao is currently in Shanghai to treat athlete's foot, and he also met him.

<p>Lord Lytton's Talk in Bombay</p>
<p>The German and French Members of the Investigative Team Arrive Back in Berlin</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, September 20th: Lord Lytton stated here today when someone inquired whether the outside predictions of the report were credible. Lord Lytton replied, "A sensitive prediction." Beyond this, he would not make any other comments, but said he hoped the League of Nations could use the report as a basis for seeking a permanent solution. Lord Lytton also spoke of the extremely serious situation in Manchuria, saying that it would be extremely difficult to place 30 million Chinese under the control of 200,000 Japanese. Although Japan could occupy the area by force, the world would have more troubles from then on.</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Berlin, September 20th: The German member of the League of Nations investigative team, Mr. Schnee, along with the French member, General Claudel, returned home via Siberia and arrived in Berlin today. Schnee told the Associated Press reporter that, in his personal opinion, a direct understanding between China and Japan is the only way to hope to resolve the Manchurian problem. As for the investigation report, Schnee refused to express his opinion and repeatedly stated that this was his personal view, recognizing that direct negotiations are a way to resolve many county-level cases between China and Japan. Schnee also said that since the Chinese government has declared its dissatisfaction with the establishment of Manchuria, peace may not be hoped for at present. Based on my personal impression, if China and Japan can reach an agreement, the development of Manchuria can have a good turnaround; otherwise, it is difficult to see a solution that takes into account the interests of both countries. The vast majority of the population in Manchuria are Han Chinese, and they are still connected to their original provinces within the customs area. If political events disrupt this relationship, it will have an adverse effect on the development of Manchuria. As for the investigation team's report, Schnee only stated that a special envoy had taken a copy of the report and sent it to Geneva via Siberia. It is expected to arrive at the League of Nations Secretariat on Tuesday, and it will be published soon. He also said that the current situation in Manchuria is more chaotic than under the old government. The terrain, especially the green gauze tents formed by the sorghum, allows the volunteer army to avoid Japanese aircraft bombing and engage in scattered small battles. I fear that the disturbances in the area will continue and that it will not be peaceful for some time. Schnee also indicated that he believes the crisis of war between Japan and Russia is not very great. Although the situation between the two countries was tense a few months ago, it has recently greatly eased. Finally, when asked whether the hope of the League of Nations would be affected by the events in the Far East over the past year, Schnee declined to answer.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reports</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Tries to Avoid Conflict with Japan</p>
<p>Or Will Submit to Japan's Request to Postpone Discussion of the Report</p>
<p>Japan is Anxious about Chairman Valera's Administrative Council</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, September 20th: Japanese officials have received intelligence that the League of Nations will do its utmost to avoid conflict with Japan in the Administrative Council and the General Assembly, and will comply with Japan's request to postpone discussion of the Lytton Report. However, Tokyo is anxious that some small countries, for their own interests and security, may continue to disagree with being lenient towards Japan, regardless of the interests of the League of Nations. There is hope that Southern Ireland's Free State leader Valera will be elected as Chairman of the Administrative Council. If so, the Japanese will be displeased, fearing that Valera will be influenced by his expression of friendship towards the United States and his intention to restrain Britain. It is said that although the Japanese government is prepared for any event, it is still willing to cooperate with the League of Nations if the League does not impose on Japan what Japan cannot accept.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, September 20th: Efforts are now being made to prevent the Lytton Report from being leaked before the proper time. The report and its translation are complete, and even the extracts sent to the British and French newspapers have been prepared, but they are awaiting typesetting. Typesetting will take about two weeks, so the report will not be distributed to members of the League of Nations until around October 9th or 10th. The report will be submitted to the Administrative Council, but it will not be discussed. Instead, it is intended to comply with Japan's request to postpone the discussion for six weeks to allow the Japanese government to study the articles in the report and send a special representative to Geneva with complete instructions. It is felt here that Japan's request for postponement of the discussion is reasonable. The League of Nations General Assembly will convene a special meeting to discuss the report, which will be held around November 21st and will last for about two weeks.</p>

<p>German Army Autumn Maneuvers</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Frankfurt, September 19th: The German Army's autumn maneuvers began near here today. This time, the scenario is that an enemy has invaded the country, occupied the right bank of the Ute River, and launched an attack by crossing the river. The exercises focus on repelling the enemy, with General Hammersstein in overall command. President Hindenburg will attend the maneuvers on Tuesday afternoon, and several foreign military attachés and officers will participate in the maneuvers as personal guests of Hammersstein, such as Italian General Monte, Soviet Russian General Tukhachevsky, Swedish Colonel Lanzén, and Swiss Chief of Staff Colonel Campaine. The attacking troops are carrying cardboard tanks and chimney stacks, and cannons made to resemble enemy weapons. The defending forces are mainly cavalry and motorized vehicles.</p>

<h3>American Expansion</h3>
<p>Philippine Air Force Strength</p>
<p>Set to Overwhelm Japan</p>
<p>Over 400 Aircraft</p>
<p>Nearly 2,000 Airmen</p>
<p>A China United Press dispatch from Manila: The United States has long realized that if it wants to compete for hegemony in the Pacific, it must decisively defeat Japan. However, the US naval base is far from the Japanese naval base, and it is often threatened by danger in naval warfare. Therefore, to contain the Japanese navy, it must seize air supremacy in the Pacific. Based on the above position, the US military authorities are vigorously expanding their Far East air force. Since 1930, a three-year plan has been implemented to newly establish an independent air force unit in the Philippines. Two-thirds of the plan has now been completed, and its strength is as follows: (1) Air force personnel have increased from 400 to 1,800. (2) 150 fighter planes. (3) 100 reconnaissance planes. (4) 3 heavy bombers. (5) 150 trainer planes. (6) One airship. The US air force stationed in the Philippines not only has a large number of aircraft, but also excellent combat capabilities. Among them, there are many excellent aircraft centered on the Philippines that can fly up to 25,000 kilometers, allowing free travel between the Philippines and Tokyo. If the entire plan is completed, it will deal a major and serious blow to the Japanese navy.</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, three aircraft carriers in the US Pacific Fleet are conducting training near Japanese territory. Dozens of new airfields have been built in various parts of Alaska, creating a situation of intimidation against Japan everywhere. The United States' various actions completely imply significant meaning to Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese-Russian Oil Contract Agreed</p>
<p>Nothing More Than Preparation for War Against the United States</p>
<p>A China United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th: The Japanese government sent Kohtaro Matsukata, former president of Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, to Russia to negotiate the purchase of Russian crude oil with the Soviet government. On one hand, it is being promoted that Russian oil will replace American oil, claiming that Russian-Japanese oil negotiations are progressing smoothly. If an oil contract is signed, the Japanese navy's oil needs will be met with Russian oil instead of American oil. This would reduce American oil sales by 16 million US dollars per year. This propaganda is being used to intimidate American oil capitalists, hoping that they will persuade the American government to temporarily ease its policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Washington on the 19th: US Navy and diplomatic officials are paying close attention to the news today that Japan and Russia may reach an oil trade agreement. In particular, there are rumors that the main reason for this move is Japan's desire to no longer rely on American oil supplies for its navy. According to government officials, this information comes from non-official channels. Therefore, aside from stating that oil exports to Japan account for only one-tenth of the total amount of oil sold abroad by the United States, they do not wish to offer any criticisms.</p>
<p>Okamura Visits the Military</p>
<p>Secretly Discussing Strategies for Invading Jehol</p>
<p>A China United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th: Lieutenant General Okamura, deputy chief of staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, visited Vice-Chief Takahashi of the Naval General Staff this morning to report on the joint operations of the army and navy in Yingkou and Qinhuangdao and other places. They also discussed the countermeasures the army and navy should take when attacking Jehol and North China. The secret talks lasted for an hour and a half. Okamura left the Naval General Staff at 11:00. Lieutenant General Okamura's trip carries a major mission, and his actions after returning to the Eastern Provinces are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>National Self-Reliance Movement</p>
<p>Saito Attends and Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>A Dentsu dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th: The Extraordinary National Spiritual Mobilization and National Self-Reliance Movement Grand Speech Meeting, initiated by the Tokyo Prefectural and Municipal Education Groups, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall at 1:00 PM today. The elderly Prime Minister Saito made his first appearance on the streets, and Minister of the Army Araki and others gave speeches on overcoming the national crisis in this extraordinary time in Japan. The audience was packed. Prime Minister Saito's speech was roughly as follows: "The recognition of Manchukuo was realized on the 15th, which is truly cause for celebration. However, when considering the future of our country, we face numerous difficulties externally after recognizing Manchukuo, and internally, the exhaustion of agricultural, fishing, and mountain villages, the plight of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, stagnant tax revenues, the continued emergence of unemployment, and the confusion in the ideological world are not easy matters. Since receiving the great mandate in May, I have made deep and earnest efforts to remedy the situation, and have repeatedly convened the Diet to implement policies step by step. However, it is difficult to remedy the situation with the government's policies alone. The people should also think of their country as they think of their own freedom, and truly unite as one, hoping to work with the government to overcome this difficult situation with a sense of determination. The late Emperor once issued a decree on spiritual mobilization, saying that if we do not change the shortcomings of the times, we may lose the achievements of our predecessors. Several years have passed since then, and the habits of frivolity and indulgence still exist, and the customs of recklessness and arrogance have not stopped. In this extraordinary time, we must have the awareness of an extraordinary time. The people of our country, whenever encountering a difficulty, have always united with a spirit of perseverance to overcome it, and the fate of the country has been able to develop to this day. Now, there are calls for self-reliance in various places, hoping not to rely solely on government subsidies and assistance, but to gradually establish plans for regeneration and implement them in practice. His Majesty is also concerned about the situation and has bestowed funds for revitalization. We should ease His Majesty's concerns and deeply feel our great responsibility."</p>
<p>Northeast Communist Party Active</p>
<p>Stirring Up the Peasant Class</p>
<p>To Fight Against Japan</p>
<p>A China United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th: According to a report from the Kwantung Army's Special Service Department to the Japanese military, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent peasant instructors to the three eastern provinces in mid-August. The largest number infiltrated the Liaodong Peninsula under Japanese rule. They used various methods to incite peasant associations to oppose Japanese imperialism, and issued the following three main directives: (1) Claiming that peasants were previously exploited by warlords and landlords, and have been impoverished to the extreme. Japanese imperialism is now directly exploiting them, causing the peasants of the three eastern provinces to face starvation. During the autumn harvest period, they should vigorously promote overthrowing Japanese imperialism and warlords, and organize rent resistance alliances. Under the slogans of resisting rent and tax payments, they should organize the masses to resist Japanese imperialism. (2) Using the peasant masses as a foundation, they should mobilize and organize mass struggles, transforming from economic struggles to political struggles. (3) The peasant volunteer army in the three eastern provinces, especially the peasant volunteer army in the Liaodong Peninsula, should be contacted in secret, their class consciousness should be awakened, and they should not be controlled by national heroes. Furthermore, they should be made to recognize themselves as class warriors. The Japanese military and police were very panicked after receiving this information, believing that if the peasants were led by the Communist Party, it would be more difficult to control the three eastern provinces. They are now gathering military and political leaders to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Indian Saint</p>
<p>Gandhi Begins Fast</p>
<p>Refusing to Accept Release Conditions</p>
<p>Fighting for Dignity for the Lower Classes</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Bombay on the 19th: Tonight, Gandhi refused to accept the humiliating conditions for his release from prison set by the Indian government. Gandhi said that he does not expect to be released, but would rather be forcibly moved out of Yervada Jail by the government.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Pune on the 20th: After Gandhi refused the government's conditions for release, he began his "fast to the death" in Yervada Jail at noon today. The government is willing to allow him to go home to fast, but he must not move. Gandhi is unwilling to accept any conditions. The government has now relaxed visitation restrictions, so Gandhi met with various representatives of the Indian people this morning, including those from the lower classes. The dispatch continues, saying that Gandhi is reportedly unwell, and his doctors have advised him not to receive any more visitors.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Ahmedabad on the 20th: As soon as Gandhi announced his fast, orthodox Hindus gathered in front of temples here to stage demonstrations, opposing the suggestion of accepting the lower classes. The angry crowds were eventually dispersed by the police.</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Pune on the 20th: Gandhi began his fast after lunch today. When the clock struck twelve, Gandhi ate his last meal before the fast, which consisted of whole-wheat bread, soaked figs, tomatoes, oranges, and yogurt. Finally, his secretary, with trembling hands, gave Gandhi the lemon juice (mixed with baking soda) that he usually drank after each meal. The meal was over, and Gandhi prayed for a few minutes with his two most loyal followers before announcing the start of the fast.</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Bombay on the 20th: At 1:00 PM today, Gandhi was legally released from Yervada Jail. However, because Gandhi believes that this release comes with humiliating conditions, he is unwilling to leave the prison cell. The authorities are treating him as someone who has been released, allowing him to freely receive visitors and leave the prison cell at any time, but only unwilling to force him out of the prison cell against his will. At 2:30 PM this afternoon, it was suddenly announced that Gandhi was unwell and could not receive visitors. His illness was reportedly caused by overwork in recent days, so the prison doctor forbade him from receiving precious guests. This afternoon, Indians gathered outside the prison gate, all coming to inquire about Gandhi's fast. Many wanted to see Gandhi, but were surprised to hear about his illness. There is currently great unrest in India due to Gandhi's fast. Countless cities have announced local boycotts, and many villages and towns are holding meetings to draft petitions to the government.</p>
<p>Germany Refuses to Attend</p>
<p>Principal Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Henderson Asks Germany to Reconsider</p>
<p>Germany Greatly Disappointed by British Reply</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 19th: Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson received a letter from Germany stating that Germany would not attend the meeting of the principal members of the Disarmament Conference on Wednesday. Henderson has now replied, expressing regret, and saying that he is convinced that the outcome of the meeting is very important and hopes that the German government will reconsider its decision not to attend, as Germany's long absence may greatly affect the future of world disarmament.</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Berlin on the 20th: Although Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson's reply to Germany was sincerely worded, it is reported that the German government will still adhere to its original decision and not attend the Disarmament Conference. Regarding the disarmament issue, an article written by Henderson was published in the British News Chronicle, attracting much attention here. In the article, Henderson openly pleaded with the former Allied Powers to fulfill the promises made in the preamble to Part V of the Treaty of Versailles and implement the reduction of armaments. In addition, British newspapers have also severely criticized the unfriendly wording of British Foreign Secretary Simon's note to Germany. German newspapers are reprinting these articles today.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 19th: A senior State Department official expressed the opinion today that the United States is deeply concerned about Germany's demand for equality in armaments, as it may hinder world disarmament. However, if European political problems have no connection to the Disarmament Conference, they will not be considered by the United States. The general feeling here is that a way can be found to allow Germany to rejoin the conference before the disarmament conference is held next February.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 19th: The Germans initially expected that the British reply regarding Germany's demand for equality in armaments would be conciliatory and propose a mediation method. Now, they are greatly disappointed with the British reply. Today, the general criticism in Berlin is focused on the assertion that the Treaty of Versailles is being upheld. With the exception of the Social Democratic Vorwärts and the National Socialist Angriff, all newspapers support the government's attitude of no longer participating in the work of the Disarmament Conference. Vorwärts says that German foreign policy is moving towards isolation, while Angriff urges the government to dissolve itself. This morning, President Hindenburg received a report from Prime Minister Papen regarding the British reply and the cabinet's opinion on the matter. A government spokesman said that Germany cannot accept Britain's assertion that Germany has no pressing reason to suddenly raise a political issue of great contention, and that there is no need to discuss it. Britain's accusation that Germany's actions are sufficient to disrupt national harmony is also an unjustified form of unfriendly wording. In fact, Germany, in view of the nature of the Disarmament Conference, had no choice but to submit this issue for discussion.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th: Foreign Secretary Simon left for Geneva today to participate in the meeting of the principal members of the Disarmament Conference. Montagu, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and British representative to the League of Nations Assembly, traveled in the same car.</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Paris on the 19th: French public opinion, as reflected by the newspapers, has changed its feelings towards Britain. In recent days, French newspapers have been suspicious that Britain sympathizes with Germany's demand for equality in armaments, and have therefore shown a hostile attitude. Now, after seeing the British government's note to Germany, they have all changed their tune and are vigorously praising it. Le Matin calls it one of the most brilliant diplomatic documents since the end of the European War. Le Journal says that the first part of the British note is similar to the French position, and is therefore largely in agreement with Herriot's reply to Germany. However, French newspapers are not so enthusiastic about the second part of the British note, and are somewhat fearful of it. Le Petit Parisien calls it empty and even dangerous. Le Journal claims that the second part is based on sand, and hopes that the British proposal will not be realized. Even the Socialist Party's Le Populaire has poured some cold water on the pro-British fervor, saying that the British newspapers have very different views from their government and still believe that the German demand is fundamentally fair.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Rome on the 19th: Although Italy supports Germany's demand for equality in armaments, those with inside information, after careful study, have all praised the British communication, feeling that this document can open a path to a solution that all parties can accept.</p>
<p>Russian Naval Exercise</p>
<p>Held in the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Leningrad on the 19th: The Soviet Russian Navy will conduct a large-scale exercise in the Baltic Sea this week. People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs Voroshilov gave a pre-exercise speech to the officers and soldiers of the fleet in Kronstadt today, emphasizing the urgent need to expand the Soviet Russian Navy. After the speech, 480 naval personnel joined the Communist Party, and another 213 expressed their willingness to extend their naval service.</p>
<p>Danzig Governing Commissioner Dies</p>
<p>A Kokumin Press dispatch from Danzig on the 19th: Count Gravina, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations for the City of Danzig, died of illness at 10:20 PM tonight. Since becoming High Commissioner in 1928, the Count has always approached all administrative matters and all disputes between Germans and Poles with a fair and impartial attitude. Therefore, after the news of his death spread, the Germans in Danzig deeply mourned him.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian's Troops Withdraw from Pingdu and Yexian</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Weixian on the 19th: Regarding the military situation in Jiaodong, according to a telegram from the magistrate of Pingdu, Commander Cao Fulin led the Rong Guangxing and Li Hanzhang brigades yesterday and advanced to the area between Yexian and Pingdu, intending to resolve the remaining Liu troops in Pingdu. Those troops dared not resist, and last night abandoned Pingdu and retreated to Yexian. It is reported that the Liu troops in Shahe also retreated to Yexian to join up with the troops retreating from Pingdu. According to last night's news, although there was a small skirmish at the front, the Liu troops retreated at the sight of the enemy and offered little resistance. It is generally observed that Liu Zhennian, due to the long battle line, will not only abandon Pingdu, but also will not defend Yexian, and will eventually retreat to Qixia, Laiyang, Penglai, and other counties. The final battle will definitely be in Muping, because Liu's troops are very familiar with Muping. Nian once defeated Zhang Zongchang and Chu Yupu, and is now burying landmines and electric nets and other defensive works in Muping as a solid defense. Han Fuju is still in Changi, leading Chen Dexin's and Ma Guanyi's brigades, as well as Li Xuande's cavalry brigade, to command the advance on the Yantai-Weixian line. Cao Fulin is leading the Rong Guangxing and Li Hanzhang brigades to command the advance from Pingdu. Ning Chunxiao's brigade is the general reserve force, with a part stationed in Weixian and another part advancing towards Changi. Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang is also in Weixian, coordinating everything. According to news from the General Headquarters, at 2:00 AM this morning (the 19th), they received a telegram from Chairman Han stating that there was a small skirmish at the front, and the Liu troops collapsed and retreated at the sight of the enemy, appearing extremely panicked. Our troops then occupied Yexian and Pingdu. Commander Cao of the Lu Brigade led the Rong and Li Brigades and also arrived in Yexian to join up, and are still searching and advancing. The provincial government is very optimistic about the campaign against Liu and expects to resolve Liu's forces within two weeks, or at most three weeks, because although Liu is determined to resist, his forces are less than 30,000, less than half of the provincial army. The area he occupies is surrounded by the sea on three sides, with no way to retreat. Without strong reinforcements, he will inevitably fail in the future.</p>
<p>Although the provincial government's documents and telegrams issued in this war list Liu's crimes and have the intention of comforting the people and punishing the guilty, the fundamental reason still lies in financial issues. When Liu negotiated with the provincial government this spring for subsidies for his troops, he initially demanded 100,000 yuan per month, later increasing it to 120,000 yuan. After the provincial government agreed to 120,000 yuan, he insisted on 150,000 yuan. At that time, a certain important person mediated, asking Liu to reduce the amount of 150,000 yuan slightly, and the provincial government agreed to everything. Unexpectedly, Liu only agreed to reduce the amount by 5,000 yuan per month, insisting on 145,000 yuan. This matter became a stalemate, and the mediator was unable to mediate. Afterwards, Liu arbitrarily intercepted tax revenues, causing great financial difficulties for the provincial government. The Shandong regime was also disrupted. The two sides gradually became incompatible, leading to the situation today.</p>
<h3>Situation of Bandit Suppression in the Border Areas of Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Liu Jianxu's Telegram Reporting to He Jian</p>
<p>Bandits in Pingjiang, Liuyang, Liling, and Youxian Have Been Scattered and溃</p>
<p>Strict Deployment in Yueyang, Linxiang, Nanhua</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha: Hunan Province borders Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, and the bandit atmosphere has not subsided. Therefore, the authorities have not relaxed their defenses in the border areas. Wang Dongyuan's and Tao Guang's divisions, subordinate to He Jian, have entered Jiangxi, and Li Jue's division has entered Hubei, specializing in border suppression missions. Liu Jianxu, commander of the 28th Army, rushed to Pingjiang on the 5th of this month to command and supervise the suppression. After joining forces with the armies of Hubei and Jiangxi, he defeated the bandit gang of Kong Hechong. Yesterday, Liu Jianxu telegraphed He Jian to report on the recent situation of bandit suppression in the border areas connecting Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. The original telegram is as follows: "I received orders on the 5th to come to the front to supervise the divisions in suppressing the bandits. Now, I will report the recent situation to you, brother. In Pingjiang and Liuyang, the autumn harvest this year has been very good. Scattered bandits in various places were all cleared out last year, and the vitality of the people has gradually recovered. The Kong bandits originally occupied Longgang, Yanxia, and other places in southern Hubei. Hearing of the joint suppression by the three provinces, they fled south as quickly as possible. Although they passed through the borders of Xiushui and Tonggu in Jiangxi, because our army's deployment was tight and the people were not used by the bandits, they did not dare to invade Hunan even one step. According to information gathered from reconnaissance, captives, and those who have surrendered, the bandits entrenched in the Hunan-Hubei border area are commanded by Kong Hechong as the general commander and concurrently the commander of the 16th Army. The 7th, 8th, and 9th divisions under his command, except for the 8th Division, which has already been incorporated, have a strength of about one regiment in the 7th Division and about two regiments in the 9th Division, with an attached wireless communication team. Each regiment has three infantry battalions, three machine guns, four mortars, and one special company and one broadsword company. Each battalion is divided into three companies, and each company is divided into three or two platoons. Each company has about 60 or 70 rifles, and each rifle has only about five or six rows of bullets, mostly homemade and often misfire. The morale of the bandits is dispersed, and those who surrender to us are coming in an endless stream. Most of them have now definitely fled to Wanzai County in Jiangxi. The attached Independent 2nd Division of the Kong bandits has about 400 or 500 rifles and is now fleeing to the Zhamazhi area of Jiangxi. The Independent 3rd Division has about 700 or 800 rifles and is now occupying Yangxin County in Hubei. The Independent 1st Division is now fleeing to the border areas of Yichun, Wanzai, and Pingxiang in Jiangxi, but the weapons are poor and are purely reorganized from the Red Guards. In addition, the guard regiments and battalions scattered in various places are all peasant bandits, and most of them have fewer than 100 broken rifles. Our army is now pursuing them in different directions and will not be difficult to completely eliminate in the shortest possible time. In Liling and Youxian, the troops of Chen Yi's Pseudo 8th Army, the Pseudo 8th and 9th divisions of Li Xuezhui and Tan Jiashu, as well as the various Pseudo Independent Divisions and Red Guards, etc., have more than 2,000 rifles and about 8,000 or 9,000 people. In the middle of last month, they invaded the Chaling and Youxian area from Lianhua, Jiangxi, and were successively defeated by the various regiments of Youxian, Chaling, and Liling in Luanshan, Hujiang, Gaolong, Yantang, and other places. They have now disappeared and fled far away towards Lianhua and Yongxin in Jiangxi. In Rucheng and Guiyang, after defeating and expelling the Peng Dehuai bandit gang, they were completely suppressed long ago. However, in various places such as Exing, Shangbao, Sishun, Guting, Yingqian, and Jinkeng in Chongyi and Shangyou in Jiangxi, there are still Red Guards and peasant bandits gathering, bordering Hunan. After Wang Dongyuan's division sent teams to pursue and suppress them back and forth, they were almost completely wiped out. The border near Hunan is extremely peaceful. In Liuyi, in the Wugai Mountain and Yaoling areas bordering Lechang, Guangdong, there were previously more than 200 bandits with more than 100 rifles gathering. In the late part of last month, as a result of the joint suppression by Wang Qu's command and the Guangdong army, the remaining bandits fled to Ruyuan in Guangdong. In Yongzhou, at the end of last month, Deng Sixi's gang, with more than 300 rifles, suddenly invaded the border of Jianghua from Lianzhou, Guangdong. They were met by the local defense teams at Quetoupuzi, and many were killed or captured. The bandits have fled far away to Lianzhou. In Nanhua, the He Long and Duan Dechang gangs of Nanhua and Yueyang, since being surrounded and suppressed by the National Army, have gathered in Honghu and Laojiao. Recently, they have had the appearance of fleeing south across the Yangtze River. Our army regiments and many warships have been deployed along the riverbanks, connecting warships, patrolling upstream and downstream, extremely carefully. It is difficult for the bandit gang to fly across. In Puqi, after the 19th Division's Tao Liu brigade cleared and suppressed them, they searched in many ways and recruited vagrants to organize the people. It is now completely peaceful. Other counties and towns are extremely quiet, with no bandit disturbances. I am reporting this specially, hoping to relieve your concerns. Your brother, Liu Jianxu, Yuan Can Yin. (15th)"</p>
<h3>Press Circles</h3>
<p>Please Protect Freedom of Speech</p>
<p>The Peiping City Newspaper Reporters Association held an executive committee meeting on the afternoon of the 17th at 3:00 PM, attended by over ten people. It was resolved to send official letters to Zhang Xueliang, Zhou Dawen, and Bao Yulin, requesting them to respect freedom of speech and refrain from arbitrary interference. The letter to Zhang Xueliang is recorded as follows: "Honorable Mr. Hanqing, The Peiping press has always maintained a fair and peaceful stance. Towards the Party and the Nation, it has strived to fulfill its responsibilities in upholding and promoting them. No matter the difficulties, this resolve remains unchanged. Past actions are clear to all with discerning judgment. In previous years, when auspicious stars shifted, and you were stationed in North China, you provided thorough protection to the press. For several years, we have engaged in open and honest communication, without any barriers whatsoever. Unexpectedly, in recent months, local authorities have been illegally interfering with the news reporting of various newspapers and news agencies. Even trivial social news of no major importance is subject to restrictions. Often, orders are issued prohibiting the disclosure of even a single word. For example, regarding the unfortunate incident that occurred at the Normal University on June 13th of this year, our association colleagues, believing that since the incident had already occurred, not reporting it would lead to distorted rumors, each newspaper, based on this view, conducted thorough investigations and, within the possible scope, announced the facts. In an effort to fulfill their duties, they aimed to avoid the dangers of misinformation. Unexpectedly, the Public Security Bureau suddenly dispatched police officers on the 14th to summon reporters from various newspapers, escorting them along the streets as if they were criminals. Although they were only briefly questioned at the Public Security Bureau before being released, the disrespect and humiliation at the time were hardly in line with respecting the personalities of newspaper reporters, and even violated your intention to care for your colleagues. For the sake of upholding the right to freedom of speech as guaranteed by the provisional constitution, our association originally intended to seek a proper resolution in accordance with the law. However, considering your usual care and concern, we hesitated to act rashly, and only sent a letter to your aides, requesting them to quickly devise appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of such disputes. Three months have passed without a response. Recently, when the Preparatory Committee for the Municipal Self-Government and the Eastern Suburb Farmers' Association had a dispute over green seedlings, our colleagues, adhering to the aforementioned principles, carefully and thoroughly announced the facts. Unexpectedly, the Public Security Bureau once again issued a circular, threatening that any disclosure of the incident would be deemed as inciting unrest, as per the instructions of the Municipal Government. Freedom of speech is enshrined in the provisional constitution, and the central government has repeatedly emphasized respect and support. If disputes between the Self-Government Association and the Farmers' Association are not reported at all, it will further arouse social suspicion. However, the local authorities are unwilling to face the facts and arbitrarily suppress them, which is intolerable. Even more astonishingly, the Political Affairs Committee recently held a meeting and even proposed banning the press. It seems they want to completely destroy the budding press. For several months, our colleagues' news reports and telegrams have been subject to inspection by the General Affairs Office. Now, with the addition of interference from various parties, the restrictions are becoming increasingly severe. How can this be allowed? The future is long, and this is a cause for great concern. Therefore, we earnestly request that you, based on your respect for public opinion and the sincerity of your colleagues' past interactions with the authorities, provide maintenance</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>and promptly establish measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. We would be deeply grateful. Respectfully wishing you peace, and awaiting your reply. Peiping City Newspaper Reporters Association." (The letters to Zhou Dawen and Bao Yulin were largely the same in wording, so they are omitted.)</p>
<h3>Record of a Journey to the West (24)</h3>
<p>The Current State of the Yanchang Oil Factory</p>
<p>One day at 8:00 AM, after breakfast, the entire group went to visit the Yanchang Oil Factory outside the West Gate. Under the guidance of Supervisor Bao, they visited various locations, completing the tour in about two hours. The current situation of the factory is as follows:</p>
<p>Oil Wells (1) The First Oil Well (now called Well No. 1) was drilled in April of the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign (1907). Oil was struck in July. By the beginning of August, it reached a depth of 243 feet, with a diameter of one foot. Initially, it produced about 3,000 catties of crude oil per day. By the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), it only produced 200-300 catties per day. In the 6th and 7th years of the Republic (1917-1918), oil production rebounded, reaching 6,000-7,000 catties per day. This was said to be due to an earthquake. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), it was deepened by 30 feet, but the daily oil production remained at around 200 catties. Because the amount of water in the well gradually increased, four drainage pumps were gradually added. The outlet pipe was a two-inch diameter wrought iron pipe. From the surface to 100 feet, the oil well was fitted with a one-foot diameter iron pipe. Below that was rock, without iron pipes. The two-inch pipe (each section 20 feet long) was placed at 270 feet.</p>
<p>(2) The Second Oil Well (formerly Well No. 2) was located more than 50 yards northwest of the First Oil Well. It was 27-28 yards deep and could produce more than 170 catties of crude oil per day. It was destroyed by bandits in the first year of the Republic (1912).</p>
<p>(3) New Well No. 1 was drilled in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and produced oil in April of the 18th year of the Republic (1929). It was 53 yards deep, with oil found at 52 yards. The cost of drilling the well was about 4,000 yuan. When oil was first struck, it could produce about 20,000 catties of crude oil per day. Because the oil production was too high and refining could not keep up, there was nowhere to store it. Therefore, for every day of oil production, it had to stop production for several days. By August and September of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the daily oil production had decreased to 700-800 catties. By the spring of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it had further decreased to 200-300 catties, and then gradually decreased. It currently still produces about 300 catties of crude oil per day. The cost of drilling the well was about 4,000 yuan, not including the cost of the machinery.</p>
<p>(4) New Well No. 2 was drilled in the winter of the 18th year of the Republic (1929) and completed in February of the 19th year of the Republic (1930). It was about 60 yards deep and located more than 100 yards west of the old First Oil Well and more than 30 yards south of the New Well No. 1. It did not produce oil.</p>

<h3>The Circumstances of Constructing the Derrick for New Well No. 1</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>(5) New Well No. 3 was located 30-40 yards north of the old Well No. 2. It was drilled in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) and completed in June or July of the same year. It was about 47-48 yards deep. The crude oil was black and thick, and the production was very low, so it was not extracted. The cost of drilling the well was more than 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) New Well No. 4 was located more than 30 yards east of New Well No. 1. It was drilled in July or August of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) and completed in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). It was about 60 yards deep. The oil production was very low, so it was not extracted.</p>
<p>(7) New Well No. 5 was located more than 30 yards southwest of the old Well No. 1. It was drilled in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and completed in May or June. It was 32-33 yards deep and did not produce oil.</p>
<p>After that, because steel cables broke frequently, machinery was damaged, and funds were exhausted, no further drilling was done.</p>
<p>Oil Extraction The current oil-producing wells are the old Well No. 1 and the new Well No. 1, described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Boilers Each well has a Rank-type 25-horsepower boiler. The boiler water is manually carried from a small river to a 3-foot square, 4-foot deep water pool, and then the water is pumped into the boiler from the water pool using steam. The water is still clean. The boilers are washed twice a year. The scale is white and about two-tenths of an inch thick. It takes half an hour to raise steam. Currently, the old Well No. 1 requires five hours of pumping and only nine minutes of oil extraction. The new Well No. 1 requires one hour for both pumping and oil extraction. The two boilers burn 1,400 catties of coal per day, costing seven yuan per 1,000 catties, or 1,000 catties of firewood, costing three yuan and three jiao.</p>
<p>(2) Steam Engines Each well has a steam engine with 15 horsepower.</p>
<p>(3) Oil Extraction The old Well No. 1 starts pumping water at 6:00 AM. When the water is exhausted at 11:00 AM, oil comes out and it is pumped for another nine minutes until the oil is exhausted. It can currently produce about 200 catties of crude oil per day. The new Well No. 1 pumps water for more than 50 minutes each day. When the water is exhausted, oil comes out for five minutes, producing about 300 catties of crude oil. The crude oil from the old Well No. 1 is transported to the oil storage pool through a two-inch pipe. The crude oil from the new Well No. 1 is transported to the No. 1 oil storage pool through a six-inch pipe. The pool is three feet wide, five feet long, and five feet deep, with a capacity of 12,000-13,000 catties of oil. It is then pumped into the No. 1 refining furnace using a two-inch water pump.</p>
<p>Oil Refining The No. 1 refining furnace is 12 yards long and three feet in diameter, with a capacity of 7,200 catties of crude oil. One furnace of oil can be refined every 24 hours. Based on the current oil production, it can be refined once every 20 days. After the crude oil enters the furnace, fire is burned at the bottom of the furnace, burning 300-400 catties of coal or 600-700 catties of firewood every 24 hours. No. 1 oil is produced at low temperatures, and No. 2 oil is produced when the temperature is increased. The vaporized oil passes through a funnel that is 30 inches high and 19 inches in diameter, and then passes through a two-inch iron pipe through a cold water pool, which turns the vaporized oil into liquid and flows into the oil storage pool. The water in the cold water pool is manually drawn from the Yan River. Every 7,200 catties of crude oil can produce 100-120 barrels of kerosene (each barrel weighs 25 catties). The residue from the No. 1 refining furnace is about 1,800 catties, which is manually carried to the No. 2 refining furnace. That furnace is similar in shape to the No. 1 furnace but smaller, with a diameter of three feet and a depth of six feet. Every 1,800 catties of residue can extract 1,000 catties of No. 2 oil. The refining time is 12 hours. The residue from the No. 2 furnace is stored separately. No other byproducts are currently extracted. The No. 2 oil extracted from the No. 2 furnace is sold after being filtered through a woolen bag. The residue in the woolen bag, when heated to a Farenheit of 60 degrees, is partially melted into soft wax. The unmelted part is yellow wax. The yellow wax is placed on top of an iron barrel. The barrel is conical in shape, with a diameter of five inches at the top and one foot at the bottom, and a height of about three feet. The bottom of the barrel is a perforated iron plate. Two or three sheets of yellow paper are placed on the iron plate, two inches of river sand are placed on the yellow paper, and two or three inches of bone ash are placed on the river sand. The yellow wax is placed on top of the bone ash. There is another barrel outside, with a diameter of one foot at the top and two feet at the bottom, and a similar height. Hot water is injected between the two barrels, and the yellow wax is liquefied and leaks down, turning into white wax, which is then poured into molds. Each mold can make 24 candles, with a pure white color, comparable to imported Western candles. Originally, every 3,500 catties of No. 1 oil were added with 10 catties of sulfuric acid and 2.5 catties of soda ash for cleaning, which resulted in a loss of one or two catties of oil each time. Currently, because the price of sulfuric acid is high, it is not cleaned, and it is sold directly. Therefore, the smoke is slightly heavier than Mobil oil.</p>
<p>Business The price of No. 1 oil is five yuan and five jiao per barrel when delivered at the factory. The price of No. 2 oil is three yuan and five jiao. Currently, the monthly revenue from old oil is over 1,100 yuan. Expenses are equal, so the income and expenses can barely be balanced.</p>

<p>Organization and Staff</p>
<p>(1) The organization of the factory: 丨 Supervisor 丨 General Affairs Section 丨 Accounting Section 丨 Documentation Section 丨 Business Section 丨 Expenditure Section 工 Works Section 丨 Drilling Section 丨 Extraction Section Manufacturing Section 丨 Refining Section 丨 Wax Making Section</p>
<p>(2) Number of Employees The current number of employees is about 30. The monthly salary of the staff ranges from 65 yuan (for the supervisor) to 17 yuan. The monthly wages of the workers range from 25 yuan to 8 yuan.</p>
<p>Other Observations After the inspection of the Yanchang Oil Factory was completed at 10:00 AM, Hu Boyuan, Feng Jinglan, Xie Jiarong, Wang Zhuquan, Yang Gongzhao, Hu Bosu, Huang Bokui, and others walked to Yanwugou, located about ten li north of Yanchang, to inspect the oil seepages in the small river there. From Yanchang to Yanxiagou, they crossed a mountain about 150 meters high. There are two oil seepages. In one, the oil rises in the water. The locals can collect more than ten catties of oil every day to burn as lamps. In the other, the oil scatters in many directions and also rises in the water, but it cannot be collected for use. The oil is black-green in color. When it rises in the water, it is shaped like a tadpole. When it reaches the surface, it turns into a flat circle and flows slightly downward. This small flat circle then expands and floats on the surface everywhere. According to geologists, if holes were drilled and wells were dug in that area, a vast amount of oil might be obtained. After about half an hour of observation, they returned to Yanchang, arriving in the afternoon after 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Geology of Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Mr. Xie Jiarong, a representative of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is a highly regarded geologist in modern China. Mr. Xie has rich experience and many publications. He participated in the inspection, which covered more than ten counties and a route of more than 2,000 li. His observations on the geology of northern Shaanxi were quite thorough. The results of Mr. Xie's geological research on northern Shaanxi are described below:</p>

<h3>The State of the No. 2 Oil Refining Furnace Before Relocation</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>Northern Shaanxi is a Basin Most people consider northern Shaanxi to be a plateau because its ground is flat and high above the Wei River valley, ranging from 300 meters to 700-800 meters. From a geographical definition, whether viewed from the topographic or geological perspective, northern Shaanxi is a basin, not a plateau. The difference between a plateau and a basin lies not in its absolute height, but in its relative comparison. That is, in a flat plain, if its surroundings are lowlands, it is a plateau; otherwise, if it is surrounded by mountains, it is a basin. Now, traveling north from Xi'an, passing through the loess terraces of Sanyuan and Yaoxian and reaching the mountainous area of Tongguan and Yijun, the terrain suddenly lowers, marking the southern edge of the basin. Looking around from the top of the mountain, high mountains border the east and west. Topographically, northern Shaanxi is a perfect basin. Furthermore, examining the sediments in the basin, in addition to the surface loess layer, the most abundant is the red soil of the Sanmen Formation from the Quaternary period (described later), followed by the red soil of the Hipparion Formation from the Tertiary period. Both of these are sediments from ancient inland lakes, which are products of the basin topography. Therefore, geologically, Shaanxi is also a standard basin.</p>
<p>Stratigraphic Sequence To study the geology of an area, one must first understand the stratigraphic sequence. Which layers are new, which are old, what are the properties of each layer, and what are their dips? All must be investigated in detail. Only then can structural inferences and geological development be based on this. In the northern Shaanxi basin, the strata seen from bottom to top can be divided into: (1) the Jurassic Shaanxi Series strata, with a thickness of 700-800 meters, the lower part mostly sandstone, the middle and upper parts mostly shale, and containing bituminous coal. The oil produced in Yanchang, Lushi, etc., also comes from this. Because it is covered only by thick layers of red soil and loess, most of this layer is exposed in deeply eroded valleys, and forms the base for the sedimentary formation of the Shaanxi basin. (2) The Hipparion Formation of red soil. This layer is named for containing fossils of the three-toed horse (Hipparion). It is from the Upper Neogene. Due to erosion, only 20-30 meters of this formation remains in northern Shaanxi. It is often exposed at the bottom of ditches, closely adjacent to the Shaanxi Series basement strata. It is more developed in the Luochuan area of central Shaanxi. (3) The red soil layer of the Sanmen Formation, which belongs to the Quaternary period, is named after the Sanmen Gorge on the Yellow River, where it was first discovered. It is the most common and developed stratum seen in this survey, with a thickness of up to 200 meters. The entire layer is dominated by reddish soil, with some interbedded clay or sand layers. What is particularly noticeable is the abundance of calcareous nodules. The red color of this layer is much less than that of the Hipparion Formation red soil below, but when compared to the loess above, one is red and the other is gray, making them easy to distinguish. (4) Loess. In the past, when discussing the geology of North China, loess was considered to be an extremely thick sediment, reaching over 1,000 feet. Recent studies have shown that this is not the case. This was due to the mixing of loess with the red soil below without distinction. In this survey, the loess seen was either covering the tops of mountains or filling river valleys. Its thickness did not exceed 50 meters. Because it is a surface covering, it often completely covers entire mountains of red soil. At first glance, it may appear that the entire mountain is made of loess, but in newly cut gullies, the red soil inside is often exposed, and the true nature of the strata can be seen at a glance. The above description is all of the strata within the basin. As for the edges of the basin, or near the edges, there are more ancient strata, such as Ordovician, Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic strata. However, since they are not closely related to the development of the basin, they will not be described in detail.</p>
<p>The Development of the Basin The above-mentioned Shaanxi Series strata, except for local areas due to faulting or folding, which have caused steep dips, are generally nearly horizontal and slightly dipping to the west. This proves that after the deposition of the Shaanxi Series strata, the area only underwent a general uplift (also known as continental movement) and did not undergo any mountain-building movements that caused folding. Furthermore, from the unusually uniform surface of the Shaanxi Series strata below the red soil, it can be seen that after the Shaanxi strata were deposited and then uplifted, they were deeply eroded. Although the result of the erosion did not create a peneplain, it had already reached the late stage of maturity in the landscape, meaning that there were no very high mountains or ridges on the surface, only low and gentle hills. On this slightly hilly surface, a vast inland lake was formed through the action of subsidence, and thus the Hipparion Formation of red soil was deposited. After the red soil was deposited, the ground rose again, and erosion continued, causing all or part of the already formed red soil to be washed away. Therefore, the remnants of the red soil layer in northern Shaanxi are quite incomplete. After this, the ground subsided again, and an inland lake state was formed again. In this, a very thick Sanmen Formation of red soil was created. After the red soil was deposited, the ground gradually rose to at least 700-800 meters, while erosion continued, resulting in the formation of many river valleys. At this time, the climate suddenly changed to arid, and strong winds carried mud and sand from far and near, flying and rising, and then falling, accumulating on the mountain slopes or filling the river valleys. This is loess. The entire developmental history of the northern Shaanxi basin should be as follows: (1) deposition of the Shaanxi Series strata, (2) uplift of the ground, causing the strata to dip slightly to the west, (3) erosion to the late stage of maturity in the landscape, (4) subsidence of the ground, forming an inland lake, and deposition of red soil, (5) uplift of the ground, causing some or all of the already formed red soil to be washed away. At this time, many river valleys were also formed, (6) subsidence of the ground, the inland lake was reborn, and the red soil of the Sanmen Formation was deposited in this, (7) uplift of the ground to at least 700-800 meters above sea level, while erosion followed, cutting the ground into many river valleys, such as the important rivers of the Luo River, Qi River, and Yan River, all of which were formed at this time. The position of this river system generally coincides with the rivers formed in the fifth stage. (8) The climate suddenly changed to arid, and the wind carried sand, forming loess.</p>
<p>As for the climatic conditions during the era that created the red soil, we cannot yet speculate. Generally speaking, it must have been humid and hot, so the iron in the soil was mostly oxidized, resulting in a bright red color. (To be continued)</p>

<p>No Bids for Slaughter Tax The local slaughter tax has always been used to fund education. Over the years, the system of government-run contractors has been changed repeatedly. After the contractor, Gang, absconded with the funds the year before last, it was changed to government-run, with the finance bureau responsible for collection. After the January 28th Incident, there was no tax revenue at all. The Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office considered the finance bureau to be ineffective and changed it back to a contractor system, with the county government setting up a counter to solicit bids, with an annual amount of 12,000 yuan, plus a construction fee of one-quarter, totaling 15,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, when the county government opened the bids the day before yesterday, not a single bid was received. The future of education funds is a cause for great concern.</p>

<p>Cruel In-Laws Plot to Kill Daughter-in-Law Shunnan, the son of Jiang Caihou, a farmer in the Xishan Township of Dongting, married the daughter of Shen Shunxing from Wanli as his wife. A few months later, Shunnan went to Huzhou to do business and met Ms. Wang Wu, a woman from the same hometown. He rented a house in Huzhou and lived with her, and opened a fruit store at Longxing Bridge. From then on, Shunnan became increasingly contemptuous of his legal wife, Ms. Shen. His father, Jiang Caihou, further listened to the words of his stepmother and also abused Ms. Shen. Ms. Shen also suffered from epilepsy. Occasional stimulation exacerbated her illness. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival this month, Jiang Caihou, together with his stepmother and his stepmother's son, Jin Gen, used a rope to tie up Ms. Shen and strangle her to death. Fearing that she would revive, they only untied the rope on the 16th and prepared a coffin. The matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the village guard Jiang Yunxiang, who reported it to the 14th Public Security Bureau. Jiang Caihou was arrested, but Jin Gen had already escaped. Yesterday, a bailiff was sent to Suzhou to ask the local prosecutor's office to send someone to the village to investigate and verify the truth.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenxiang Executed Zhang Wenxiang, a wind instrument player from Liuhe County, had an affair with Ms. Wang Xiao, the wife of his fellow villager Wang Songlin, in the eighth year of the Republic (1919). Wang Songlin discovered the affair and tried to stop it. On the fourth day of the fourth month of that year, Zhang invited Su Yuanliu to strangle Wang to death with a rope on Pingshan Avenue in Yu's Family Little Street. The county government arrested Zhang, and he was sentenced to death. Zhang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which upheld the death sentence. The High Court sent prosecutor Ren Guanghai to supervise the execution at the Third Prison execution ground at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 20th), and Zhang was legally executed.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>District Court Prosecutor Comes to Changzhou to Investigate the Lei Case Lei Renlong, the former president of the Wuyi County Court, was previously accused of multiple offenses by the Judicial Administration. The commissioner Xu Shuchang came to Changzhou to investigate and dismissed him. The embezzlement part was ordered by the Wuxian District Court to investigate and interrogate him once. It is now heard that the District Court, to facilitate the interrogation of the various charges against Lei, specially dispatched prosecutor Lu Wenqin to come to Changzhou from Suzhou by car on the 19th with a court clerk. They filled out summonses at the County Court and sent bailiffs to summon the persons related to the case to be questioned on the morning of the 20th. Those summoned included lawyers Chen Yuanjun and Chen Chang'e, the rickshaw puller Lao Zhang, the court accountant Xu Yucheng, Wu Fuxing and Wu Fugou who gave the maid to Lei, and the clerks in charge of the case.</p>

<p>Second General Meeting of the Jiangsu Defense Committee The third second general meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Defense Committee was held on the 19th, in the morning and afternoon, at the auditorium of the Construction Department. Gu Zhutong chaired the meeting. The main points of the discussion were: (1) Commissioner Qi Liu's resignation as a standing committee member was approved. (2) Commissioner Yang Hanxi's resignation due to illness was rejected with condolences. (3) To divide the province into several defense corps training areas, each area will have a training supervisor, and Liuhuaiyang Xuhai and 25 counties will be divided into six defense zones. These two cases were approved in principle and handed over to the standing committee for handling. (4) To suggest that the provincial government reorganize and reduce the number of police teams and water patrol teams in various counties to strengthen defense capabilities. (5) The defense corps should set up shooting ranges to practice live ammunition shooting to improve skills. The principle was approved and the standing committee was asked to set up a simple target range and issue orders to various counties for implementation. (6) A military training plan for defense corps in secondary schools and above was proposed by the original proposer Zhao Zhengping, who was asked to formulate implementation measures and submit them to the standing committee to suggest that the provincial government adopt and implement them. (7) A suggestion to the provincial government to establish a defense corps general command and district commands. (8) To nominate Commissioner Sun Shaojiang as a standing committee member. (9) To reject Commissioner Zhao Zhengping's resignation as a part-time member of the training group with condolences.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Calls Meeting of Various Industries The local Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from all industries in the city yesterday (the 19th) to meet at the Chamber. More than 30 people attended, chaired by Wang Jingting. The main cases discussed were: (1) Filling out business tax declaration forms, (2) raising funds to pay business tax for the autumn and winter seasons, (3) urging the payment of outstanding taxes, all of which were resolved by the entire body and will be handled and raised separately.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Headquarters of the Water Police Moves to a New Location The Fourth District Headquarters of the Water Police was originally located in Shanghai. Since moving to Tongzhou, it has been temporarily operating in the headquarters of the 18th team due to the lack of suitable housing. Now, District Chief Zhang believes that the location is remote and the housing is small and insufficient for use. He decided to move the district headquarters to the Yuan Family Garden on Wusong Road in the west of the city. In addition, due to the rampant piracy in the Daan Port, the soldiers of the 18th team stationed in Tongzhou were specially transferred to Haimen to facilitate nearby suppression.</p>
<p>Conflict Between Security Regiment Soldiers and Civilians On the morning of the 19th, the provincial security regiment stationed in the Baibu District of Rugao County stopped the local civilians from welcoming the gods in a parade, resulting in a conflict. The two sides fought with force near Chema Lake. As a result, five civilians were killed and one was injured. One soldier of the provincial security regiment was also killed. The county government, fearing that the incident would escalate, dispatched a police team to suppress the incident.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Recent News on You Jiliang's Encroachment on Public Land: More than twenty mu of the old Xi Cang base in Xiuyi were entirely encroached upon by You Jiliang. It was not discovered until the demolition of the northern city wall the year before last. After being reported to the provincial and county authorities, the lawsuit has been ongoing for many years without resolution. Recently, the province ordered the county to instruct the You family to pay 11,625 yuan based on an estimated value of 500 yuan per mu within ten days. The deadline has now passed, and the You family is again offering excuses and sophistry, submitting a request to the county. The county government, by misquoting clauses, hopes to delay the matter, which is highly inappropriate. In addition to rejecting the request, they have submitted a report to the province seeking instructions on how to enforce the order. Enforcement will commence as soon as the order arrives.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Socony Cargo Ship Encountered Pirates: The local branch of the American Socony Company loaded approximately two hundred cans of kerosene and gasoline onto an old-fashioned sailing ship from the Dexingxiang branch office in Xiangshan on the 13th of this month. On the morning of the 15th, at 4 a.m., while the ship was sailing through the Longdongmen waters near Xiangshan, it suddenly encountered four pirate ships with thirty to forty bandits. The bandits swarmed onto the Socony cargo ship, and two sailors were taken hostage, while one was released to report to the company. They also provided a business card of the bandit leader, Wang Longbiao, demanding a ransom of 350 yuan to be paid in the waters off Xiangshan for their release. The released sailor arrived in Ningbo yesterday and reported the piracy incident to Li Dayao, the general manager of the Ningbo branch. According to Li, the loss of goods is estimated at over 800 yuan.</p>

<p>Continuous Wind and Rain Cause a Significant Reduction in Cotton Harvest: In the sandy areas of Xiaoshan's eastern countryside, around the Mid-Autumn Festival, cotton is usually at its peak harvest. Unexpectedly, on the 16th and 17th, strong winds and heavy rain persisted for two days and nights, causing all the cotton bolls to be blown off, falling into the mud, and even completely scattering. The farmers are lamenting their misfortune and requesting the county government to provide relief measures.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Preliminary Suggestions for Reforming Chinese School Education (I)</h3>
<p>Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>The call for "reform education," "reform education" has often reached our ears in recent years, and it has been sung even louder since the September 18th Incident last year. Originally, the new education that has been promoted for forty years has not prevented the country's danger, the people's suffering, and the society's unease from being worse than forty years ago. Anyone who thinks about it calmly cannot deny that the past education has shortcomings and needs to be reformed. But how to reform it? Is it the Dalton Plan or the Montessori method? Should we follow Dewey's affairs or Russell's claims? Then there is no consensus. I am not an education expert, but because I am engaged in educational administration, I have a lot of feelings about the shortcomings of China's current school education, and I also have some opinions on reform. Now I will write them out to ask for advice. Perhaps some people will compliment me for my novel theory, and perhaps some people will criticize me for my absurd remarks. I dare not accept compliments, and I will never refute criticisms. But I sincerely hope that educators and those who care about education at home and abroad will calmly discuss my ideas, or have a considerable impact on the practical work of reforming education. That would be a blessing not only for me personally, but also for Chinese education.</p>
<p>To talk about reforming education, we must first understand what education is. We must know that education is different from literature and art. Literature and art can have no other purpose. The essence is the purpose. So we say "literature for literature," "art for art" is understandable, but "education for education" is not understandable. Whether we talk about it for the individual or for the country, education is just a method, a tool, a road. We want to use this tool, this method, this road to achieve another goal. For the individual, the goal of Chinese people receiving education in the past was mostly to become officials, and now the goal of many people receiving education is to get rich. Becoming an official and getting rich, as long as it is through legitimate means, is not necessarily a trivial matter, but the legitimate goal of an individual receiving education should be to use education to develop the body and mind so that he can better understand the meaning of life and enjoy the interest of life, and at the same time be a healthy and beneficial member of society. From the perspective of the country, the goal of education is the national policy of the country. In other words, education is a tool for the country to implement its national policy. Therefore, what kind of career does the country need? Education should create what kind of career. What kind of talent does the country need? Education should cultivate what kind of talent. If we can achieve this level, the education of this country will be successful. If we cannot achieve this level, the education of this country will be a failure. Therefore, the goal of education in a country completely shifts due to national policy, and the education system and education content should also be determined according to the education goal. Since national policies are different from country to country and different from time to time, education goals, education systems, and education content are naturally inseparable from the two important factors of "the time" and "the place." The education of time A and place A certainly cannot be the same as the education of time A and place B. Even the education of time A and place A may not be consistent with the education of time B and place A. The reason for the failure of Chinese education in the past is that it has ignored this principle. The education system and education content only know how to blindly follow the claims of other countries and pick up the dregs of Western philosophers. They have completely failed to target the needs of the country. Therefore, the students cultivated by the schools are not the talents needed by the country, nor can they undertake the careers needed by the country. Therefore, the result is that the schools are increasing day by day, and the number of people receiving education is increasing day by day, but the country is becoming more and more chaotic, poorer, and closer to danger and demise. It is truly worthy of our regret and hatred. The past is gone, and the future can be pursued. Now, if we want to reform education to save the country from danger and demise, we must first recognize the needs of the country, and then determine the goal of education according to this need. Once the goal is determined, all education systems and education content must advance toward this goal. This kind of education can correct the mistakes of the past and can undertake the important task of saving the country.</p>
<p>What does China need now? How should the goal of education be determined? The answer to this question may vary from person to person, but in my opinion, what China needs most are the following five things, and education should also have the following five goals: First, now is the era of national competition, not individual competition. The invasion of our country by others, whether it is military invasion, political invasion, or economic invasion, is all attacking with the power of the entire nation. If we do not resist them with the power of the entire nation, we will definitely not be able to resist them, and there will definitely be a danger of demise. But unfortunately, most members of our nation are ignorant, and their knowledge and ability are all below the horizontal line. In this situation, how can we not fail in competing with others? More than 80% of our country's population are rural farmers. They work hard all day long to support themselves and others. Their diligence and frugality can really shame a group of adults and gentlemen who enjoy without working. They are truly the vitality of the country, but their knowledge is really childishly pitiful, and their ability is really weakly laughable. Most of them do not know the simplest written characters, do not understand the most superficial mathematics, and do not have the most basic knowledge of hygiene and science. They are completely unaware of the dangerous situation of the country and the nation, and they do not understand the history and geography of their own country or the general trend of the world at all. They do not know how to unite, cannot help each other, and cannot defend themselves. They can only adopt a policy of non-resistance and sit and wait for death in the face of the exploitation of corrupt officials, the burning and killing of Red bandits and bandits, and the attacks of perpetual droughts and natural disasters. It is really extremely pitiful. How can these people, no matter how many there are, save the country from danger and demise? But we cannot bear to blame them, we must blame the country. The reason why they have no knowledge and no ability is entirely because the country has not given them the opportunity to receive education. We must now use the power of education to improve their knowledge, increase their ability, and make them become healthy citizens who can fulfill their responsibilities to the country. Therefore, cultivating a majority of healthy citizens is China's first need at present, and it is also the first goal of Chinese education.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Loan Easy to Obtain, Difficult to Return</h3>
<p>Dried-Up Amount Continues to Rise by Two or Three Taels: Yesterday, the 20th, the gold loan price rose and fell, hovering around 730 taels, fluctuating by two or three taels at a time. Throughout the day, there was a total fluctuation of about nine taels. Afterwards, the overall increase was 13 taels. The confidence of the industry turned upward, and buyers were excited. The initial drop was due to the inverse reaction to the silver market's several days of decline. Although the exchange rate was small, the U.S. dollar rose again. Later, the fluctuations were constant, revolving around 727-728 taels. While the foreign exchange rate was still stable, buyers on the surface were persistent, and short sellers also replenished their positions. At noon, the trend was firm and favorable. Suddenly, the exchange rate became tight in the afternoon. The industry sold and then bought back, and major players fiercely competed for purchases. The market situation suddenly reached a peak, seeing a new high of 734 taels and four mace. The reason for the advance was nothing more than the lack of quantity, making it easy to advance but difficult to retreat. The overall market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Morning Market Chaotic and Unpredictable: The market opened at 727 taels and five mace, down four taels from the opening price in November. Large amounts and silver prices suddenly increased by one-eighth. The forward price increased by five mao, and private telegrams increased by sixteen one-hundredths. Then, it decreased slightly to 27 taels and two mace. Zhaofengchang and retail customers first entered the market. Then, China Merchants Bank bought U.S. dollars for January at 30.875 and for December at 8125, adding up to 28 taels and a half. However, sellers followed closely, including Bingxing, Hengyu, Yuantai, Hongkangyong, Xiexingyong, Yuanmao, Hengchangyong, and Zhaofengchang. Zhejiang offered British pounds for October at 19.125, and Zhongfu offered half a U.S. dollar. As a result, the price fell by three taels, reaching 25 taels and six mace at 9:30. HSBC's listing remained unchanged. At that time, Zhaofengchang re-entered the market, and Yongfeng, Hengchangyong, Futaiheng, and Yuanheng followed suit. Citibank absorbed U.S. dollars for January at 875, and the Japanese Commercial Bank made a deal for the current month at 4375. The price rebounded by three taels, reaching 28 taels and nine mace at 9:50. Afterwards, it seemed to decline, but it was complex and unpredictable. From around 10:00 to 11:00, the price turned back by about two taels. Zhifengyong, Senchangyong, Bingxing, and Yuantai all sold. Yuanxingyong, Zhaofengchang, and Hengyu entered and exited intermittently, while Dadecheng, Yuanmao, and Futaiheng bought. The exchange market rose and fell slightly, reaching 26 taels and four mace at 11:00, then increasing to eight taels and four mace, and then to seven taels. By 11:30, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Shunli, Wanxing, and Zhaofengchang all entered the market. Macaulay and Wahbi absorbed U.S. dollars for January at 875, and Zhenjin entered near-term at 4375. The price soared by two taels, reaching 29 taels at over 30 minutes past eleven. In an instant, it fell by one tael due to Bingxing's efforts to sell, especially with HSBC offering British pounds for October at 19125, which was 27 taels and eight mace. Suddenly, it rose again, as Hengyu, Yongfeng, Tongyurun, Dadecheng, commodity hedgers, and Zhaofengchang competed to buy tirelessly, raising the price to 29 taels and three mace in less than ten minutes. Unexpectedly, some retail speculators closed their positions, causing the price to depreciate by one tael, but it fluctuated by four or five mace. By the close of the morning market, it was 28 taels, and the chaotic and unpredictable market was difficult to fathom.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Shows Sharp Edge: The afternoon market opened at 28 taels and a half, then at 27 taels and two mace. Later, Datong and others absorbed U.S. dollars for January at 875, and then made a deal at 8125. Old Citibank also absorbed 8125. As Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, Hengyu, and Richang all entered the market, it immediately exceeded 30 taels, reaching 30 taels and three mace and a half. Then, it decreased by one tael to 29 taels and three mace. Hengyu, Yutai, and Yifeng sold. Afterwards, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Daxingyong, Zhenchangxiang, Shunli, and Wanxing competed to buy, so U.S. dollars for January were only worth 75, and the entry and exit of British pounds for this month were both possible. At 3:15, it was 32 taels and a half. This was because Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Yiyu, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, and others came to sell, and U.S. dollars for December could be settled at 625, and U.S. dollars for November were halved. Before long, it retreated to 30 taels and seven mace. After 3:30, it showed a sharp upward trend again. A silver company came to buy U.S. dollars for October at 375. The buying momentum on the surface intensified. Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong, Hengyu, and Tongfengheng competed to buy without reservation. By almost 4:00, it was 33 taels and three mace. Suddenly, it decreased slightly by one tael to 32 taels. After a while, it rose again, and the exchange market strengthened. Near-term U.S. dollars were only settled at 25. Tongfengheng, Qingfayong, and Yuhe all entered the market. Then, Bingxing suddenly bought back, making the market feel even higher. By the closing of the market at 4:30, it reached 34 taels and four mace, an increase of two taels and nine mace compared to the previous day. Afterwards, it continued to trade to four taels. According to the record, the maximum was 34 taels and four mace, and the minimum was 25 taels and six mace, a fluctuation of eight taels and eight mace. The total increase was 15 taels.</p>
<p>Official Price Lowered by Two Taels: The official price remained at 800 taels, lowered by 74 taels to 71 taels, 72 or 73 taels in the afternoon, and 68 taels later, two taels lower than the previous day. However, gold transactions still had dual settlement prices. The morning market was 38 taels for September and October, and 28 taels for November. The afternoon market was 44 taels to 34 taels. The supplementary water was 34 taels in the morning and 40 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Market Demand Exceeds Supply: Trading on the surface was very lively. According to statistics, Zhaofengchang and Dadecheng both squeezed in more than 500 bars. Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, and Yuanheng all entered more than 300 bars. Yuandayong, Kanghongyong, Hengchangyong, Futaiheng, and Yongfeng all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, and Yuanmao all bought in slightly. Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and Yuhe all sold. Fuchang sold 400 to 500 bars, and Tongtaichang sold less than many people. Bingxing sold more than 1,000 bars and hedged.

<p>Customer Sales Slightly Expand, Price Difference Turns Around:</p>
<p>In recent days, the foreign market has been rising step by step, only advancing and not retreating, so the price is high and the amount reaches about one fen. The situation is as rapid as the previous decline. However, there have been slight twists and turns in the past two days, and there have been mutual differences in highs and lows. However, as customer sales are gradually active, it is feared that the market atmosphere may also have room for advancement.</p>

The afternoon market fell back half a li, calculated as 6 qian, 9 fen, 4 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu and a half. As a result, it was slightly higher than the previous day's early market by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. The "silver dismantling" opened at 2 fen in both the early and afternoon markets, which felt slightly better than the white market on the previous day. The splitting head added water by 4 to 5 fen. There was no superior image in the silver root.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Small Foreign Coins Surge Especially: Yesterday morning, Jiangnan small foreign coins were particularly expensive due to the impact of customer sales, with the price rising to 9 li, calculated as 6 qian. The afternoon market fell slightly by 1 li to 6 qian and 0.9 li. The transaction was 9,500 jiao in the early market and 6,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins seemed to fall back 2 li, with both the early and afternoon markets at 5 qian and 8 fen and 8 li. The transaction was 115,000 jiao in the early market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 wen, to 427,000 wen. The transaction was more than 43,500 strings, calculated as 10,200 taels of silver. However, compared with the market price of more than 30,000 qian, it has sharply reduced by more than 2,000 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday (20th), the situation in the various bond markets of the China Merchants Securities Exchange was as follows: only the salt tax was offered at 1,000 yuan in the afternoon market, and there was no market for other bonds.

Transactions totaled 1.9 million yuan in the morning and afternoon, including more than 400,000 yuan for the unified salt tax, more than 200,000 yuan for the 20-volume demobilization bonds, and still little for others.

The environment was dull, and major players rarely traded. There were only a few swap settlement transactions on the market. The supply and demand situation was very balanced.

<p>New York Stock Market Turns Weak</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: Monday, the New York stock market turned weak. The early market had a brief rebound, but it was fleeting. In the afternoon, due to political instability and a poor report from U.S. Steel, the stock was dumped, and the price also turned down. Trading was sluggish due to the wait-and-see attitude of all. The total transaction volume was 1.3 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Advances from Fatigue</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation is very fatigued, and the decline is still strong. Due to the poor environment, those who are selling short are abnormal. Cotton Slightly Rises, Rongxing bulls have not yet acted, but people's hearts are not encouraged, the situation is very weak, and most tend to sell off and bearish, but the civilian goods of each factory are not very strong, in fact, the time is in autumn, although there is no large amount of transactions, sporadic or not less than cut off also.</p>
<p>Near-Term Yarn Falls by 1.6 Taels: The opening of the Renbiao previous market was still flat. In the second and third rounds, due to the poor cotton market and the saying that the factory would hedge this month, each month fell by one or two taels. As a result, each month fell by 1.2356 qian. In the afternoon, those who profited settled, and each month rose by 3456 qian. The total transaction statistics were 33,800 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 1,800 bales, Shenchang 950 bales, Yiyu 900 bales, and Dachangcheng 900 bales. Jifeng bought 1,150 bales, Renfeng 1,100 bales, Yichang 990 bales, and Shenji 650 bales.

<p>Cotton Market Feels Weaker:</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak. Due to the good weather, it is conducive to the listing of new cotton. Although American cotton rose by 10 pounds, it is mostly considered a small rebound after a big drop. Loose cotton is also being oppressed, and the market atmosphere is getting weaker. Xincheng is actually selling, and the empty amount has increased to 120,000 dan. Generally, those who are stable, although the domestic season is in the midst of a surge in shipments, the decline has been too rapid in recent days, and the price has approached 31 taels. They are unwilling to short new positions, and the gold price is not small, and the exchange rate has shrunk. However, most have tended to sell off.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closes with More Floating: Zheng Biao opened in the morning market, and with American cotton slightly rising, the people in the market were indifferent. In the second and third rounds, it fell again. As a result, each month fell by 3 qian. The afternoon market opened, with net more closing, falling by 2 or 3 qian.

Futures rose by 6 to 10 pounds, and spot rose by 10 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 8 to 10 points, and spot fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 20 points.

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>River Below Rice Market Settled</p>
<p>South of Shanghai Yesterday, about 20 ships from various guilds arrived at the rice market. Sales in urban and rural stores were favorable due to the weather turning sunny and the season for new rice. Moreover, prices in the northern market were relatively lower, so demand remained normal. Prices for superior glutinous rice were stable, but secondary grades were sluggish. There was a considerable supply of new glutinous rice, but sales were slow, with prices slightly reduced. There was also a large supply of new Do-Yang sharp rice, and the market appeared small.</p>
<p>New Gate Yesterday, a total of 26 or 27 ships arrived from inland routes. Trading in this street was flat. There was some demand for Changshu northern glutinous rice and Zhongguan, Jiangyin, and Yixing rice. Prices were slightly sluggish. New glutinous rice market had no ups and downs. Guest demand for mixed sharp rice and Jiaobai sharp rice remained slack. Sales on this street were also slow.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to Fall, Future Wheat Difficult to Advance</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the future wheat market in the morning, prices for various months were affected by another slight drop of 12 to 13 cents in the price of foreign wheat, causing widespread concern. Although selling was brisk, the market atmosphere was inevitably depressed. As the source of foreign wheat had not been cut off, factories could continue to order it. The high standard caused concerns that foreign wheat orders would continue to flood in, and these concerns were not without reason. Therefore, near months fell by 1 or 2 cents, and distant months fell by 3 cents. By the time the afternoon session opened, the stability of the flour market in the morning had calmed people's minds, and buying and selling were quiet, so trading was not smooth. Future movements should be based on the price of foreign wheat. As a result, this month was unchanged, October fell by 2 cents, November fell by 3 cents, and there were no other significant changes. Spot wheat saw delivery was quiet, and only packages were unopened.</p>
<p>Flour Market Seen as Rising in the Long Term, Weak in the Short Term</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for various months initially appeared flat and then stable. Because the price of foreign wheat fell by about 12 to 13 cents, people's minds initially weakened, and prices were nearly a cent lower compared to the previous day's closing price. However, as factory selling was quiet and selling pressure was not smooth, the market seemed slightly better in subsequent sessions. By the time the initial opening of the afternoon session reached December, selling was still quiet. Only in January and February did Fuxin slightly increase its offerings. The market atmosphere was flat. The current asking price for foreign wheat was slightly better by 2 or 3 cents, and it could still be ordered at around 2 taels, 7 maces, and 7 or 8 candareens. This situation is ultimately seen as rising in the long term but weak and quick in the short term. As a result, this month was better by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, October to December were unchanged, January was better by 2 li, and February was unchanged.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to Be Demanded on This Street</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were inquiries about Hunan rice from the Northern Guild, but the market price was deemed unfavorable, so no transaction occurred. Only this street demanded foreign rice. The Northern Guild and Hankou Guild had completed a small amount of loading the day before and would have to wait for trial sales to continue. Loading by customers had already stopped, and demand on this street was not very strong, so the market shape softened again. Only 500 bags of small ground rice were opened, with prices ranging from 8.55 yuan to 8.35 yuan, which was 2 or 3 cents lower than the previous market. There was not much Saigon rice in stock. The cargo owners were eager to sell, so the market price could still stand. 1,000 bags were opened, with prices ranging from 9.6 yuan to 9.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Returns Weak</p>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm stated that on Monday (the 19th), Chicago wheat initially rose due to a firm Liverpool market but then fell due to poor export demand. As a result, it fell by 0.625 to 0.875 pounds of silver compared to the previous day. The total volume of transactions on the 17th was 20 million bushels. The market prices on the 19th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September 49.25 Down 0.625</p>
<p>December 51.25 Down 0.875</p>
<p>May 57.50 Down 0.750</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Holding Steady, Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the levy for sugar was firm, the market trend turned to standstill because customer sales after the holiday had not yet increased significantly. The guild's price for No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar was still called at 14 taels and 6 maces, and No. 20 medium sugar and white sugar was called at 14 taels and 5 cents, but there were no transactions. According to the sales figures for the previous week, the total was only over 22,000 colors, and sales were indeed lackluster. Jianbing opened 50 pieces of Hesong white ice yesterday, with a price of 10 taels per box, and dozens of boxes of Polo ice at 9 taels and 9 maces, and 60 boxes of Lion ice at 9 taels and 8 maces. Various shops in Gaozhang Diao Yin are still in the process of sampling, and prices can only be discussed tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>White Factory Silk Gradual Sales Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overall reports from foreign factories had not yet reached Shanghai, and foreign firms were watching. However, domestic factories were opening, and the demand for white factory silk for winter silk was gradually increasing. As the market prices had fallen back, they seized the opportunity to sell. A total of 40 packages of Shanghai white factory silk of grades B from 18 to 22 strands from Hangzhou factories were imported, with prices ranging from 535 taels to 575 taels. 25 packages of Shanghai white factory silk of grade B from 16 to 18 strands from Huchou factories such as Minghua were imported, with prices ranging from 525 taels.</p>
<p>Lyon Italian Silk Prices Turn Sluggish After Rising</p>
<p>All Grades of Italian Silk Fall 3-4 Francs per Kilo</p>
<p>In the Lyon raw silk market, prices have generally trended downward recently due to Japanese silk being sold at discounted prices. Italian raw silk has also seen a decrease in factory imports. Although prices have been set, on Monday, super grade was only offered at 338 francs per kilo, special grade at 124 francs, and superior grade at 102 francs, all down 3-4 francs.</p>
<p>Zhenmei and Gongxi Prices All Tend to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms in this port saw some scattered demand for Zhenmei, Gongxi, and green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Shexian from English and Russian firms. The market was not very deserted, but because overseas prices were extremely tight, the attitudes of Chinese merchants varied. Zhenmei market prices had already fallen by more than 10 taels compared to before, and Gongxi had also fallen by 4-5 taels. As for Zhenmei and Xiumei, because inventory had been exhausted, market prices were stable. In addition, the English sales of Qimen Ningzhou black tea had completely stopped recently, and the Xiezhuhui was also watching and not importing. The market situation was very pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Melton Cloth Sales Active, Market Firm</p>
<p>The Melton cloth market is firmer than that of ordinary heavy cloth. Goods that sold for 2 taels and 0 maces last year are only selling for 1 tael and 7 or 8 maces this year. Recently, however, there seems to be a trend towards firmness, with each yard averaging several cents better than the opening price. This is because its market sales are slightly active, and large uniform stores are uniformly selecting this material. As a result, the market atmosphere of the guild is rising steadily. Currently, Gu Quanlong Jinghuayuan brand is wholesaled at 1 tael and 7 maces, Ningfeng Dashijiang at 1 tael, 8 maces, and 7.5 cents, Huabo Lianhuan Tu at 1 tael and 9 maces, and Deji Dulanxiang at 3 taels and 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Autumn Leather Nails Depreciate 5 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market felt slightly lively due to slightly active customer sales. New lead wire, yellow steel wire, English steel plate, flat white iron, and tinplate were all sold in batches. However, because the transaction volume was small, the market prices did not change much. However, the price of autumn leather nails, which had been extremely stable, suddenly depreciated by 5 cents yesterday. 3-fen nails were valued at 22 taels and 4 fen to 21 taels, 5-fen nails at 20 taels and 5 cents, and 6-fen nails at 20 taels and 2.5 cents. Inquiries came from Qingdao, Jinan, and Tianjin, while there were only sporadic transactions along the Yangtze River. There were rumors that Shanghai nail factories were also producing autumn leather nails, and the future may see more price drops than rises.</p>
<p>Tinplate Actual Sales Stagnant Again</p>
<p>The hardware market situation after the holiday still shows a trend of hovering, with customer sales mostly watching. Factory demand is also weak. Therefore, the market has almost no certainty for large transactions except for scattered small businesses. Tinplate, which has long been known for its brisk sales and activity, has also become very weak in the market recently due to stagnant actual sales. The standard is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. For example, 90-pound English goods are valued at 10 taels and 2.5 cents, 100-pound at 12 taels, 90-pound American goods at 13 taels and 7.5 cents, 100-pound at 15 taels and 2.5 cents, 200-pound official grade American tinplate is valued at 30 taels, English goods at 22 taels, 180-pound official grade American goods at 25 taels, English goods at 20 taels and 2.5 cents, and Company iron American goods open at 21 taels and 2.5 cents, English goods open at 10 taels and 2.5 cents. 35-pound English and American tinplate are each opened at 39 taels and 5 cents. The above tinplate only sells about 100 boxes per day, which shows how cold the market is.</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Bundles of White Iron Tiles Newly Arrived</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for white iron tiles, which had been trending upward due to a shortage of spot goods, suddenly had no shortage panic. According to tea house news, the New Taikoo Warehouse has shipped another 1,256 bundles of this product, causing the supply to temporarily exceed demand and greatly weakening people's minds. As a result, the standard also showed signs of loosening. For example, No. 24 is estimated at 9 taels and 2.5 cents, No. 26 at 10 taels and 7.5 cents, and No. 28 at 11 taels and 2.5 cents. It is said that a certain construction guild has purchased over 200 bundles, but sales to customer guilds have not improved.</p>
<p>Coal: Domestic Coal Still Shows No Improvement</p>
<p>The market situation for various types of domestic bituminous coal has recently trended downward again. Daily transactions do not exceed 600-700 tons, which is caused by the influx of Eastern coal and sales at reduced prices. The market sells Zhongyue lumps at 8 taels and 2.5 cents, Shizhipu at 8 taels, Shentian lumps at 6 taels and 5 cents, Yuanshan lumps at 5 taels and 2.5 cents, and San Miners Fushun at 8 taels and 7.5 cents.</p>
<p>Liujiang Coal Prices Also Sluggish</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of various white coals, such as Hongqi, Mark, and Henan, have been affected by the drop in the price of Shanxi coal, so the market prices have also fallen. Recently, the price of Liujiang coal has also been affected. The market sold it yesterday at only 13 taels, 7 maces, and 5 cents per ton.</p>

<h3>Jin Wensi and Others Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Set Sail Yesterday on the British Mail Steamer Rangitiki</p>
<p>To Assist the Delegates Attending the Geneva Conference</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Mr. Jin Wensi, who will be appointed Minister to the Netherlands, and Mr. Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were ordered to go to Geneva to assist the Chinese delegates to the League of Nations General Assembly, Yan Huiqing, Guo Taiqi, Gu Weijun, and others. Mr. Jin and Mr. Shen, accompanied by Mr. Jin's wife and son, as well as Mr. Shi Zhaokui, First Secretary of the Chinese Legation in France, departed at 4:00 PM yesterday on the British mail steamer Rangitiki. The details of their departure from Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>Those Seeing Them Off Yesterday, those who went to the New Customs Wharf to see off Mr. Jin and his party included former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting, Mr. Tang Shixuan, representative of Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of Postal Affairs Lin Bao, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Guo Dehua, Deng Zhongying, Zhao Tiechang of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xianglin, and Mr. Jin's elder brother Jingyuan, about 50 people in total.</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai The Rangitiki was scheduled to set sail at 4:00 PM. Therefore, Mr. Jin and his party arrived at the New Customs Wharf at about 2:00 PM. After arriving at the wharf, they shook hands with those who came to see them off to express their gratitude. At 2:30 PM, they said their farewells and boarded the Postal Bureau's small boat and the Public Works Bureau's small boat, speeding towards the Rangitiki, which was docked at the No. 17 pontoon. Their family members saw them off until they reached the large boat before departing.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin's Remarks According to Mr. Jin, before leaving Shanghai, he told a Central News Agency reporter on board the ship that he was ordered to go to Geneva to assist the three representatives, Yan, Guo, and Shun, to attend the League of Nations General Assembly. He would strive to fight for the country's survival and hoped that the people of the country would be of one mind and one heart to support diplomacy. This was his earnest hope before leaving Shanghai. He was scheduled to arrive in Marseilles in 20 days, and then change trains in Marseilles, pass through Paris, and reach Geneva. He would arrive in two or three days. Whether he would return to the country for instructions after the League of Nations General Assembly closed, or would be ordered to go directly to the Netherlands, he could not yet determine. Mr. Jin believed that the Japanese representative's request to the League of Nations to postpone the publication of the investigation report for six months, while urging the puppet organization to send consuls abroad, was a kind of conspiracy and plan by Japan, and hoped that the world would recognize it. According to Mr. Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had lodged a serious protest against Japan's blatant disregard for everything and destruction of our Northeast territory and sovereignty, and its recognition of the puppet organization on the 15th. It had also notified the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and was still continuing to proceed.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the United Front of Anti-Japanese Armies in the Northeast</h3>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan Transmits a Telegram from the Shanghai Office of the Liaojihei People's Support Association: "We have received a telegram from He Qingming and others in Zhanyu stating that the invasion of the Northeast and the nation's resistance to Japan for national salvation have permeated the north and south. All those with conscience are invigorated. Although the organizations are different, the wills are the same. Qingming and others are mindful of the responsibility of every individual and have left the country through secret routes to run around and appeal, leading the people. Over the years, countless sacrifices have been made, all in the hope of world peace and adherence to the Nine-Power Treaty. But after enduring for a year, the violent Japanese not only did not repent, but also forcibly created a puppet state and then recognized it, destroying all morality and faith in humanity. Qingming and others could not bear it any longer, and on the painful memorial day of September 18, they dispatched troops to Liaoning to annihilate the fierce and stubborn enemies. All the forced people in Taonan, Tuquan, Kaitong, Zhanyu, Tongliao, Zhangwu, Faku, Taiping, and Zhengjiatun are willing to take up arms and go to the front to kill the thieves together. The self-deceiving puppet army all raised the banner of 'Chinese people do not fight Chinese people.' The Mongolian compatriots also deeply hate the cruelty of the Japanese slaves and have awakened and returned. Heaven's will and people's hearts are converging, and justice and law can ultimately prevail. The Northern Manchuria National Defense Army under Ma Zhanshan, the Southern Manchuria Youth Army under Wang Zhenwu, the Jilin Self-Defense Army under Ding Chao, Li Du, and Feng Zhanhai, the National Salvation Army under Wang Delin, the Liaodong Volunteer Army under Tang Juwu, and the various anti-Japanese national salvation armies in Liaoxi and Liaoning have different names, but they are united against Japan. They support each other, drive out the violent Japanese together, cooperate and assist each other, and restore our homeland. Patriots in the country, overseas Chinese, and armed comrades throughout the country have always been enthusiastic and have provided much assistance. Our army is now gradually recovering the counties of Bianzhao, Kaitong, and Liaobei, and the meeting in Liaoning, Changchun, and Harbin is just around the corner. We hope that the compatriots throughout the country will rise up in response, save the people from water and fire, and drive the Japanese invaders out of the country. We sincerely report this and hope you will be aware. He Qingming, Guan Yuhang, Zhang Kewei, Xie Guochen, Hu Bili, Jin Dexuan, Liu Zhenyu, Tong Liansheng, Li Haishan, Bao Dianqing, Liu Jiguan, Teng Haishan, Zhang Lin, Yu Hai, and all the soldiers and civilians of Liaobei kowtow together. Please announce it immediately. Mu Qiaoyin."</p>
<h3>Aviation Recommendation Association</h3>
<p>Distributes Leaflets in the Sky</p>
<p>Arousing Public Attention</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, the Chinese Aviation Construction Association specially commissioned the Cangzhou aircraft of the China Aviation Corporation to distribute leaflets, starting from Longhua Airport and flying around various districts of the city. The association's aviator Shui Qirui was in charge, and Yin Zhiling, Jiang Junyi, and Zhu Lin boarded the plane together. They were in the sky for about an hour, distributing a total of 10,000 leaflets, which were colorful and eye-catching. Passersby stopped to watch and scrambled to read them. The leaflets stated, "If you want to save China, you must rely on the air force. The defeat in the Shanghai war was due to air transport," and so on.</p>
<h3>Aviation Construction Association</h3>
<p>Exhibition and Lecture Meeting Closes</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Construction Association has attracted the profound attention of the general public since its opening of the propaganda exhibition at the YMCA. In recent days, major newspapers in Shanghai, such as Shen, Xin, and Shishi, have published special issues for it, and slogans have been posted on major roads. On the 20th, aircraft leaflets were distributed in the sky, which was large-scale and sensational throughout the country. Yesterday, the closing ceremony of the exhibition was held. Yan Zhifang presided over the meeting, and Yin Zhiling reported on the progress of the exhibition and lecture meeting. First, he stated that due to time and ability constraints, the association had not been able to fully prepare for the exhibition, resulting in a small scale. However, it was grateful for the attention of the community and the enthusiastic attendance. It was very grateful to the experts who had condescended to speak during their busy schedules. The speeches, such as "Introduction to Aircraft," "Chinese Aircraft Manufacturing," "Future Aviation and National Separation Plan," "Commercial Aviation," "Military Aviation," and "The Latest Anti-Aircraft Guns," provided concrete and detailed overviews. In the exhibition, they especially appreciated Mr. Zeng Yijing's loan of equipment, as well as the various valuable photos from various aircraft companies and the Shanghai media community, who either opened special issues or assisted in publicity. However, due to the short time and lack of strength of the colleagues, they were unable to contribute more, which was very regrettable. Now that the lecture and exhibition meeting is closed, everyone knows that we advocate aviation and build aviation. At the same time, we see that there are many problems with the general advocacy methods of the past that must be taken into account in advance to avoid abuses. For example, in recent years, many people have advocated building roads. As a result, roads have been built and cars have also come, but they are mostly imported products, and the outflow of money is calculated in the tens of thousands every year. Therefore, we advocate aviation and first focus on education and manufacturing, so that the Chinese can also manufacture materials and gradually adopt domestic products. For example, even a very small screw in a car must be sought from foreign goods, which is really regrettable. The function of aircraft is even greater. If foreign goods are always needed, then once international warfare breaks out and is caught in the vortex, the sea will be blockaded, and we will only be able to give up. This must be considered in advance. Talent is also extremely important. Flight personnel are not ordinary talents and must be cultivated and trained for several years before they can cope with the airspace. Therefore, this association is proceeding cautiously and is first running an aviation engineering class with Jiaotong University, and will then run flying schools one after another. One more point that I would like to ask everyone to pay attention to is that the success of the aviation industry is a heavy responsibility and must be assisted by the people of the whole country. Funding and airfields must be provided by the public to be effective. Other related issues, such as weather maps, wireless electricity, chemical materials, and various equipment, must be resolved at the same time. China is still in its infancy in these areas. For example, weather maps are only available along the coast and are based on the French Xujiahui Observatory and the Qingdao Catholic Church. There are still no general statistical charts of various climates in the mainland of China. Wireless electricity has not yet achieved the effect of communication. The equipment for fog and night flying is almost non-existent. Domestic flying has not yet reached a mature state. For example, Xiabu in Jiangxi, silkworms in Shandong, and fir in Fujian can all be used as aircraft materials. However, raw lacquer and tung oil require detailed chemical research. The special steel for the cylinders in the engine must rely on electric steelmaking. All of these require engineering experts with academic, experienced, and research minds to work together. This also requires the government and experts to make a general mobilization to find a solution.</p>
<h3>German Aviator Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>German Consulate General Holds a Banquet Tonight to Welcome Him</p>
<p>German aviator Captain Wolfgang von Gronau, who is flying around the world in a seaplane, is about to arrive in Shanghai. According to news from the German Consulate General in this port, the aviator is expected to arrive in Shanghai around noon today, the 21st of this month, and will stay in Shanghai for two days before flying to Hong Kong. It is now known that German Consul General Feng Lide has specially scheduled a banquet at his official residence on the evening of the aviator's arrival to welcome him. Acting Executive Yuan President Song, Mayor Wu of this city, Secretary-General Yu, the General Manager of China Aviation Corporation, the General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, the German Acting Consul General in Hankou, and the main figures of various German groups in this port have all been invited to attend, which can be called a grand event in recent times.</p>
<p>According to information received by the German Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday morning, Captain Gronau, the German aviator who is circumnavigating the world, is expected to fly from Japan to Shanghai at noon today and plans to land in the Huangpu River near Chenjiaojiao, opposite Yangshupu. After arriving in Shanghai, he will stay for two days and then fly to Hong Kong, add fuel, and then head straight to Manila, and then return to Berlin via Vietnam and India. This port has already prepared a welcome. In the afternoon after his arrival, the Royal Air Force Association will host a banquet for him at the top floor of the HSBC Building. The next night, the German Consul General in Shanghai, Colonel Cronburg, and the German community will hold a formal welcome ceremony. Mr. Gronau is 39 years old and is a Prussian. He served as a German naval pilot during the European War and was shot down twice, but was not injured. He is accompanied by three people, a pilot, a co-pilot, and a radio operator.</p>
<h3>Italian Envoy Cianetti</h3>
<p>Talks About the Italian Government's Policy Towards the Far East</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Italian Envoy Count Cianetti spoke to a reporter from the North China Daily News yesterday (19th) about the impressions of the Italian government on the recent political developments in the Far East and made the following remarks: "Messages from foreign sources claim that the Italian people hold certain views on the Sino-Japanese dispute, especially on Japan's recognition of 'Manchukuo.' Such news is completely unfounded. Since the Sino-Japanese dispute occurred, the position taken by the Italian Fascist government can fully reflect the feelings of the Italian people. This position has long been deeply known, that is, it is entirely inspired by Italy's sincerity and traditional friendship towards the two major nations of Asia. The debates in Geneva and the actions taken by the diplomatic representatives in this port are sufficient to prove that the Fascist government has spared no effort to facilitate a fair and peaceful mediation of the dispute. The attitude of the Fascist government still adheres to this principle."</p>
<h3>Good Opportunity for National Goods to Sell Well in Nanyang</h3>
<p>Living Up to the Patriotic Efforts of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>After Japan recognized the puppet organization, overseas Chinese in Java have unanimously resolved to stop handling inferior goods. They have sent a telegram to Shanghai, ordering the Shanghai purchasing office to terminate the shipment of goods that have already been ordered and to stop ordering goods that have not yet been ordered as soon as possible. There are no fewer than 30 Japanese merchant ships traveling to and from the Nanyang Islands, and their daily business depends entirely on the transportation of overseas Chinese. Now that the boycott is implemented, overseas Chinese will switch to handling domestic goods to make up for it. This is truly a good opportunity for national goods to sell well in Nanyang. We deeply hope that the government will reduce taxes and merchants will lower prices, so as not to let down the patriotic efforts of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Haas and Others Leave Shanghai on Sunday</h3>
<p>Report to be Released Around the 7th of Next Month</p>
<p>Haas, Secretary-General of the League of Nations Northeast Investigation Team, is still staying in Shanghai after his previous visit. At 9:30 PM last night, he visited Mr. Song Ziwen for a meeting. He was unwilling to talk to reporters about anything related to the report, and was also unwilling to announce the date of his departure from Shanghai. A reporter from the New Voice Society interviewed Mr. John J. Taylor, the League of Nations secretary who came with Mr. Haas. According to him, Mr. Haas is now scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Empress of Canada steamship this Sunday (25th) to go to the United States, and then return to Europe. Mr. Haas will be accompanied by his wife and Secretary Xue Li. Mr. Taylor himself will stay in Shanghai temporarily. As for the date of the release of the report, it seems to be around the 7th or 8th of next month, but the exact date has not yet been determined. However, it has been decided to send a copy to the Chinese and Japanese governments first. The investigation team has not yet received any reports of Japan's request to the League of Nations to postpone the study of the report. (New Voice Society)</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Meets Donne Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guo Chengen, Chen Xing, and Others Pay a Visit in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Mr. Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, met with Zhang Xueliang's advisor Donne at his residence at 9:00 AM yesterday, and then went out together, returning at about 2:00 PM in the afternoon. In the evening, he met with Guo Chengen, Director of the Central Mint, Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, and many others. According to Mr. Song's aides, Mr. Song has no plans to leave Shanghai recently. The rumors that he has already gone to Hangzhou or is about to go to Hangzhou are not true.</p>
<h3>Record of Post-Disaster Works on the Jiangnan Seawall</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall Post-Disaster Works Committee was established on April 11th of this year and is now approaching its half-year anniversary. The post-disaster works have now been completed and are scheduled to be open to public viewing on the 24th and 25th of this month. Our reporter made a special visit to the committee to interview them and record what was heard, as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation of the Seawall The Jiangnan seawall in Jiangsu Province starts in Changshu, passes through Taicang, Baoshan, Shanghai, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, and joins the Zhejiang seawall in Jinshan. The seawall in Taicang, Baoshan, Songjiang, and Shanghai's municipal jurisdiction is the most critical. Other counties have shallow sand as protection outside the seawall, while these counties' seawall directly clashes with the huge waves everywhere. The Taihu Lake basin is originally a triangular alluvial plain at the mouth of the Yangtze River, so the terrain is extremely low and humid. When the seawall collapsed during the Qing Dynasty, the seawater directly rushed to the Suzhou area, and even the river water in Zhejiang Province had a salty taste. Taking Shanghai as an example, during the annual high tide season, the tide passes through the Huangpu River, which has repeatedly reduced its height, but still goes ashore in the P灘 area from time to time. During the great flood last year, all banks and warehouses were submerged. If the seawall collapsed and the seawater rushed in, the whole city would easily see the scene of Hankou last year. The Jiangnan seawall in Zhejiang Province is what is called the Qiantang seawall, which was first built by King Wu Yue Qian Liu and has a very good foundation. It has been repaired in various dynasties. In the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, 3 million taels of silver were used to repair it once. It is also close to the capital of Zhejiang Province, and the authorities have been able to pay attention to it since the Republic of China. However, the section in Jiangsu Province has a poor foundation and has been abandoned in recent years. Since the establishment of the National Government, there has been no formal dedicated management agency. The annual repair funds are nominally budgeted but never actually issued, resulting in the collapse of most of the 坦坡 石幾 同豁齒. The great wind and tide on August 25th and 26th of last year was unseen for many years. Many places were in danger. Fortunately, the wind direction changed from northeast to southeast, and the dangerous seawall was preserved. Otherwise, it would have completely collapsed, and the disaster would have been unknown.</p>
<p>Organization of the Seawall Works Committee After the seawall was in danger last year, the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, out of its own interests, sent Ou Chu and Du Yuesheng to investigate and sent a telegram to appeal. The banking industry and the Chamber of Commerce, considering the tragedy of the Hankou flood, also rose up to demand that the government earnestly repair the seawall. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government jointly established the Jiangnan Seawall Post-Disaster Works Committee, hiring Niu Yongjian as chairman, Mu Ouchu as vice chairman, Shen Chang as secretary-general, Hua Chucang, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiheng, Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Wu Ouzhai, and more than 40 others as committee members. After the end of the Shanghai war, it was organized and established, and the committee publicly elected Shen Chang as the director of the engineering special committee, Zhang Xiaoxin, Song Kaichuan, Shi Wenran, Dan and others as committee members, who were responsible for the full responsibility of reviewing and calculating the amount of the park works. On the one hand, the provincial government sent Wan Kaijia as the director of the Baoshan Section Engineering Office, Qiu Xijue as the director of the Changtai Section Engineering Office, Xu Baikui as the director of the Songjiang Section Engineering Office, the municipal government sent Zhang Danru as the director of the Gao Qiao Engineering Office, and Dai Liangjing as the director of the Wusong Engineering Office, who separately conducted detailed surveys, designs, and bid invitations. Construction started in sections from June 1st.</p>
<p>Engineering Plan Considering the Chinese seawall, the most solid one is the 塘 made of large strips of stone, called the strip stone work, such as the Hua Xiang Baoshan stone seawall, which has not been damaged for a long time. The new type of seawall uses reinforced concrete to build the bank wall and builds a stone 坦坡 outside. It has the solidity of the strip stone, but it is a pity that the design is improper and there is a lot of cutting corners, which is not as strong and durable as the old-fashioned stone. The pile stone work means that outside the earth seawall, large blocks of stone are piled up, and then a row of dense piles of 18 feet long are driven outside the stone blocks. Stone blocks are piled up outside the piles, and piles are driven outside the stone again. If it is to be strong, it can be up to four layers. This time, limited by funds, only two layers are built. However, the selection of materials is extremely cautious. The piles are all fir wood produced in Fujian, and the stone materials are all large blocks of stone produced in Ningbo, with some Suzhou Jinshan stone used in between. The original steel-bone cement bank wall is all added with pulling piles, pulling iron 鐺 beams, and building sealing walls and throwing large stones outside. Engineering Budget and Fundraising It would cost no less than 20 to 30 million yuan to thoroughly repair the Jiangnan seawall. The association suggested adding a special tax on the Jianghai Customs, but it was not realized due to the department's discussion. Therefore, it was proposed to have a temporary treatment plan, totaling 3 million yuan. Also, limited by funds, it was impossible to collect this huge amount of money in a hurry, and time was pressing, so it could not wait for a long time. Therefore, those who were most urgently needed were selected to be built first, with a budget of 800,000 yuan, including (1) Gaoqiao remedial reinforced concrete new-style work 57 zhang, (2) Gaoqiao newly built two-pile two-stone and water-swinging dam work 551 zhang, (3) Baoshan Shizilin South Section two-pile two-stone work 67 zhang and 5 chi, (4) Baoshan Chenhuab浜 two-pile two-stone work 122 zhang, (5) Baoshan Wuyue塾 two-pile stone work 145 zhang, (6) Baoshan Xuejiatan two-pile two-stone work 336 zhang, (7) Baoshan Niutou涇 two-pile two-stone work 80 zhang, (8) Baoshan North Wangmiao two-pile two-stone work 255 zhang, (9) Baoshan military post-disaster rectification project, (10) Taicang阅兵台 North-South two-pile three-stone work 128 zhang and 2 chi, (11) Taicang Daotangmiao cement wall North-South section two-pile three-stone work 137 zhang, (12) Taicang Daotangmiao cement wall outside added throwing block stone 92 zhang, (13) Taicang Daotangmiao built-up header pouring block stone wall 12 zhang, (14) Taicang Fangjia堰 cement wall South outside rectified 坦坡 added throwing block stone 105 zhang, (15) Taicang Yanglinkou North two-pile two-stone work 20 zhang, (16) Taicang military post-disaster rectification project, (17) Songjiang second section two-stone work 31 zhang and 1 chi, (18) Songjiang third section new work supplementary project 210 zhang, (19) Songjiang fourth section 坦坡 added throwing block stone 155 zhang, (20) Songjiang military post-disaster rectification project, (21) Changshu Xu Liujingkou East two-pile three-stone work 50 zhang, (22) Changshu Xu Liujingkou West two-pile three-stone work 3 zhang, (23) Changshu military post-disaster rectification project, (24) Yanglinkou South two-pile two-stone work 65 zhang. However, even this 800,000 yuan is only a virtual number and there is no real funding. Fortunately, the government is wise. The province specially allocated 700,000 yuan of busy transportation and offsetting bonds, and the city specially allocated dock donations of 10,000 yuan per month. Vice-Chairman Mu and committee members Du Yuesheng, Du Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, and Shen Lisun went to the silver and money industry to offset and borrow money, and the silver and money industry also understood the righteousness and took on the responsibility within its capacity, raising 650,000 yuan. Then, Zhang Gongquan, Du Yuesheng, Jin Houcheng, and Shen Lisun repeatedly ran to the central government, and the Ministry of Railways allocated 150,000 yuan of supplementary fees. The Disaster Relief Committee donated 8,000 yuan, and the Chinese Red Cross also allocated 2,000 yuan, so 810,000 yuan was collected, which exceeded the budget by 10,000 yuan. The engineering expenses were more economical than the budget because everything was open. As a result, there was a surplus of more than 53,000 yuan. It happened to be the autumn flood season, and there were no funds available in the provincial and municipal treasuries, and there was a great need for materials for flood prevention and emergency repairs, so the surplus funds were used to purchase all the materials. The price of this purchase was even cheaper, about 30% lower than the usual price.</p>
<p>Supervision of the Project The provincial and municipal governments paid great attention to this seawall project. Dong Xiujia, director of the Construction Department, personally went to various counties to inspect every month, and Director Shen of the Engineering Bureau also came to the site to supervise and inspect from time to time. In addition to the ten inspectors specially assigned by the committee to be stationed at the site for regular inspection, Vice-Chairman Mu, Secretary-General Shen, and Chief Inspector Wu also took turns to the site to supervise and inspect, so the project progressed extremely quickly and was completed in three months. According to regulations, it would take at least three years to complete.</p>
<p>The Future of the Seawall The Seawall Post-Disaster Works Committee has scheduled to end at the end of this month, and the various engineering offices will continue to exist and be subject to the command and supervision of the competent authorities. It is the best policy to raise huge amounts of money and continue to build. Otherwise, if 200,000 to 300,000 yuan can be raised annually for repairs, there will be no major dangers in 20 years. If the situation is still as lax as in previous years, it will be difficult to avoid danger when a major flood comes.</p>
<p>Office Expenses of the Seawall Committee Since the Seawall Committee is of an honorary nature, the monthly office expenses are budgeted at only 1,200 yuan. The association has made special efforts to economize, and all the opening and closing expenses are paid from the regular expenses without asking for additional funds. Therefore, the office expenses used by the association in the past six months were less than 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>United Reserve of the Money Industry</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Inspection of Reserve Funds</p>
<p>Totaling over 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Now Moved into New House on Ningbo Road</p>
<p>After the establishment of the United Reserve of the Money Industry in this city, the reserve funds have been fully paid. Yesterday, the inspection committee inspected each household in detail and decided to officially start work on October 1st. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Inspection and Preparation After the United Reserve of the Money Industry had all of the businesses place the reserve funds into the public treasury, yesterday afternoon at 1:00, the inspection committee Shao Yanshan, He Zhongxiao, Qian Sheng, together with the working staff, at the Ningbo Road Money Industry Association, examined and checked the reserve funds of each household in detail and clearly, in order to verify them. It was not completed until 7:00 in the afternoon. As for the total amount of the reserve funds paid, it was over 50 million yuan. Therefore, the foundation of the money industry in this city has been further consolidated.</p>
<p>Moving into a New House The reporter of the New Sound News Agency met with General Manager Qin Xiqing yesterday. According to him, the new site of the United Reserve in Xingrenli, Ningbo Road, has been repaired. All the arrangements and public treasury have been completed. The directors of the three departments of internal accounting, cashier, and document have been appointed. They moved into the new house to work the day before yesterday. As for the official opening date, it was decided on October 1st, but no ceremony will be held at that time.</p>
<h3>Various Charity Groups</h3>

<p>Joint Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The joint organization of Shanghai charity organizations to organize the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, on the day before yesterday (19th) at 4:00 pm, at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, convened the third joint meeting of standing finance directors and directors of various groups. Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Zhu Yinjiang, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Zhengting, Qu Wenliu, Huang Bodu, Yangshan, Huang Hanzhi, and more than 20 others attended. Xu Shiying was publicly elected as chairman, and Yang Jichun and Ren Shizhen recorded the meeting. The meeting was held as scheduled. First, the chairman reported that the total amount of donations received from the establishment to September 18 was 692 yuan. Zhang Zilian, manager of Samsung Cotton Iron Factory, sent a letter stating that, starting yesterday, all employees of the factory would deduct 10% of their salaries for one month to help the Northeast Refugee Relief. Also, from September 18th to 22nd, for a total of five days, 10% of the sales revenue in the store would also be used to help the relief. After checking, 10% of the salary of the factory's employees can get more than 240 yuan. The daily sales revenue of the store is usually 1,000 yuan, and the peak is 5,000 yuan. Calculated based on a compromise, it can be 200 yuan per day, and 1,000 yuan can be extracted in five days. According to the gentlemen, after the factory's trial run, it is planned to persuade all stores in the city to do the same. Can it be as good as possible? And incoming and outgoing documents, etc. Next, the resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) The Northeast disaster is mainly water damage. The association should first focus on relieving the water damage in Jilin and Heilongjiang and start emergency relief. (All methods will be handed over to the resident executive directors to preside over the handling.) (2) Revise the articles of association of the association's office in Pingjin and send a letter to Tai Xiling to determine the monthly expenses to be informed to the association. (3) Starting from now, 5:00 pm every day will be the office time for representatives of various groups to attend the meeting. (4) Other things. It was not dismissed until 7:00.</p>
<h3>The Blockade of Northeast Postal Services Affects Revenue</h3>
<p>Annual Loss and Increase of Over Two Million Each</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Will Adopt Austerity Policies</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Lin Shi, director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Transportation, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the blockade of the Northeast Postal Service has come to an end. Ba Lidi and others, the postmasters of the Liaoning District, will also go south. The postal service in the three northeastern provinces can collect more than 2 million yuan annually. After the suspension, this income has disappeared. The postal workers in the three provinces, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, resigned and entered the customs. The Ministry of Communications is finding ways to resettle them, and the annual expenditure will increase by 2 million yuan. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has to adopt austerity policies in order to achieve</p>

<p>balance of payments. As for the Postal Economic System Research Committee's proposed postal economic system plan, it has been reviewed by the committee's special committee and a good solution will be available in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</h3>
<p>Received a Letter of Thanks from the League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<p>Thank You for the Hospitality of the Longhe Steamer</p>
<p>In April of this year, the League of Nations Investigation Team traveled from Shanghai to Hankou on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Longhe steamer. Now I know that Lord Lytton, for the quick service and thoughtful treatment of the ship's owner and crew at that time, sent a letter from Beiping to the company to express his gratitude before returning home. The general idea of the letter is that in early April, our group had a trip to the Yangtze River, and we were honored to have the use of the excellent steamer Longhe. I have long wanted to write a letter to your company to express my gratitude for your kindness, and I would also like to express my gratitude for the crew's quick service and excellent treatment. The pleasure of this trip goes without saying. In the future, every time I think of our country's six-month work in the Far East, I will also remember this trip to the Yangtze River. Please convey the gratitude of our entire group to the ship's owner. Everyone in our group hopes that in the future, we will have the pleasure of boarding your company's steamer again, etc. In addition, the group took the Longhe steamer, and the cabin was booked by the China Travel Service, and the luggage was also taken care of by the travel agency.</p>
<h3>Telegrams Urging Han and Liu to Stop the War</h3>
<p>The Anti-Civil War League and the Chamber of Commerce Both Sent Telegrams</p>
<p>The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance's daily standing committee members Wu Daquan, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Secretary-General Yan Esheng, and Accounting Director Chen Zeqing all went to Hangzhou successively to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society and other official duties. After hearing about the conflict between the Third Route Army of Han Fuju's department in Shandong and the 21st Division of Liu Zhennian's department in Hangzhou, they immediately convened a temporary talk meeting of daily standing committee members at the RenShou Villa in Yue Fei's Tomb, Huanbi Bridge, Hangzhou at noon on the 19th. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, and standing committee members Zhang Xiaolin, Chen Zeqing, etc. attended. After detailed discussions, it was decided that the first step was to send a telegram to Han and Liu to quickly order a halt to military operations and seek other ways to resolve the issue. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie to find ways to mediate and avoid war. Now the daily standing committee members of the association Lin Kanghou Wu Daquan Du Yuesheng, etc., have successively rushed back to Shanghai. After the results of the discussion in Hangzhou, the telegram that should be sent was also sent out yesterday. After another consultation at noon today, the second step will be carried out. The telegram is recorded as follows,</p>
<p>Telegram to Han Fuju Jinan Provincial Government urgently forwards to Chairman Han, I have always heard of your great theory, advocating suppressing weapons against foreign countries. Recently, I have seen your political achievements in governing Shandong, and I deeply admire you. I was suddenly shocked to hear that the Third Route Army has had contact with the Eleventh Division. At this critical moment of national disaster, how can we bear to have another civil war? I pray that you quickly order a halt to military operations and resolve the issue by political means. Loving the people like a public servant, you should be able to eliminate the war in the shortest possible time and will not bear to suffer the people for the sake of saving them. The purpose of our association's position is to hear your clear teachings. In addition to sending a telegram to Division Commander Liu, I urgently submit this telegram and respectfully ask for your review and acceptance of the reply. The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance General Assembly bows.</p>
<p>Telegram to Liu Zhennian Yantai Division Commander Liu, the Japanese recognize the puppet state, and the national crisis is becoming more urgent. I was suddenly saddened to hear that the 21st Division had contact with the Third Route Army. When the enemy enters the house, how can we allow quarrels? If there is any misunderstanding, it can be resolved in other ways. I urge you to quickly order a halt to military operations, avoid war, and wait for the central government to deal with the matter. I cannot help but pray. In addition to sending a telegram to Chairman Han, I specifically submit this telegram and respectfully ask for your review and acceptance of the reply. The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance General Assembly bows.</p>
<p>Telegram to Shen Honglie Qingdao Mayor Shen, the association has just been established and is preparing to actively carry out its work. I was suddenly saddened to hear that the Third Route Army had contact with the 21st Division. The purpose of my position is to seek elimination. In addition to separately telegraphing Chairman Han and Division Commander Liu to quickly order a halt to military operations and resolve the issue by political means, you have a clearer view of the situation and must have deep concerns. Mediation should be in mind. Please do your best to mediate and avoid war, and also show the truth so that the association can also be effective, turn hostility into harmony, and only depend on you. I respectfully submit this telegram and ask for your review and acceptance of the reply. I look forward to it and pray to it. The Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance General Assembly bows.</p>
<p>Shen Zechun's Letter Shen Zechun's letter to the Standing Committee of the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance said, "I have repeatedly seen reports that Han and Liu are at odds. I believe that this is entirely within the scope of civil war. The establishment of this association has just occurred, and this unfortunate civil war has occurred. We should immediately strive to work hard to practice the purpose of the association's organization and carry out the spirit of non-cooperation between the two sides. It is appropriate to cooperate with only one side and there is no appropriate way to stop it. The association's future is trembling with fear. Gentlemen, with great enthusiasm and bearing the hope of the whole country, I urge you to quickly decide on a plan and actively carry out work to maintain the public order in Shandong Province and fulfill the honor of the association. Zechun is a member and cannot remain silent. At a critical moment, I dare to contribute my humble opinions. I hope you will investigate."</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce's Telegram The City Chamber of Commerce's telegram yesterday urged Han and Liu to cease the war, saying, "Jinan Chairman Han, Yantai Division Commander Liu, the military affairs in Jiangxi and Gansu have not yet ended, and Pingjin and Rehe are constantly threatened. The enemy is protecting the rebels and clamoring to invade, but dare not resist with a single arrow. This is the day when the generals and marshals are sleeping on their spears and are too busy to blame themselves. How should we train soldiers and pacify the local areas to relieve the central authorities of their worries? I did not expect that there would be no news of resisting the invaders, but internal strife turned urgent. Shandong is the shoulder and back of northern Hebei. Once the war is connected, it will be opportune for the enemies to rejoice and give them the opportunity to gain Long and hope for Shu. Moreover, the frontiersmen and subordinates of the general, even if there are different things, they should appeal to the central government and wait for the disposition quietly. If we first interact with each other, no matter what reason we hold, it is to ignore the government and harm the living beings. At this time when the people are vehemently opposing civil war, whoever can first cease the war and wait for orders is the one who gains the most help. I hope you will think twice. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>The City Party Department Today Commemorates Zhu Zhixin</h3>
<p>And Issues a Proclamation to the People</p>
<p>Today is the memorial day for Mr. Zhu Zhixin, a member of the Kuomintang. The City Party Department of this city specifically held a memorial meeting in the auditorium on the third floor at 10:00 am. In advance, all institutions, groups, and party departments at all levels were notified to send representatives to participate, and Committee Member Huang Zaoxiong was appointed chairman to issue a proclamation to the people, saying,</p>
<h3>Road Association Seeks Opening</h3>
<p>The National Road Association sought members and held an opening ceremony yesterday at the YMCA. The venue was filled with displays of achievements and slogans from road and city administrations across the country, along with statistical tables, road and city publications, photos of past members, and the names of those seeking positions as officers. The colorful array conveyed the association's achievements and the importance of road construction at a glance. Attendees included Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, Wu Kaisheng, Qu Yingguang, Xue Dubi, Ma Kui, Yan Zhifang, Tao Jia Yao, Ding Chao Wu, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yan Ganyuan, Zhao Jinqing, Fan Guang, Zhu Shaoping, Chen Binhe, Qiu Fenchi, Zhang Peinian, Huang Wan, Song Zhen, Lu Lihua, He Yongzhen, Peng Xie, Li Denghui, and over 130 people including commanders and officers of the various detachments. At 7:00 PM, Chairman Wang Zhengting presided, first reading the second article of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction. He also reported that the championship trophy had been purchased in consultation with Mayor Wu and requested Chief Commander and Mayor Wu Tiecheng to give a speech. Mayor Wu then gave a speech, saying: "At the last meeting of this association, I was unable to attend personally due to tracheitis. Although my throat ailment is not fully recovered, I still made an effort to attend and meet with you gentlemen, which I am very pleased about. This time, the Road Association is holding its 12th membership drive, and the reason for inviting me to serve as Chief Commander, I think, is for two reasons. First, I am currently serving as a public servant of this city, and second, roads have a close relationship with municipal administration. The team leaders attending today are very enthusiastic. In this era of severe national crisis, to still see this phenomenon proves the ability of the association's staff to promote road construction, and it is also a work to save the nation. It further proves that the way to save the nation is to do something practical, not to boast verbally. As long as everyone can do their best and fulfill their duties, and strive forward, what national crisis is there to speak of? Currently, the sound of economic recession is spreading around the world, and our country can hardly escape being an exception. However, I believe that China's position is different from other countries. The material and human resources of other countries have been developed to the point where they cannot be further developed. The natural treasures within other countries have also been fully exploited. In our country, however, goods are abandoned on the ground and minerals are hidden in the mountains. Is there any province that does not have undeveloped mineral resources and wasteland? The Northeast and Northwest regions are especially abundant. Therefore, our country's resources and productivity are not only different from those of countries nearing exhaustion, but we are also worthy of being a country with vast territory and abundant resources. However, even with such rich products and vast territory, we still suffer from poverty every day. Tracing the cause, we cannot but attribute it to the obstruction of transportation and the neglect of road administration, which prevents the flow of goods between regions. Even if we want to adjust surpluses and deficits, we are unable to do so. The four essential elements of national life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—must rely on imported goods. Leaving aside other things, a country that owns a continent and has prided itself on being an agricultural country for thousands of years still needs to purchase essential foods such as rice and wheat from abroad. What could be stranger than this? Take Guangdong province as an example. Each year, it purchases rice from Siam and other places, and this money flowing out of the country reaches seventy to eighty million, or even one hundred million. Furthermore, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have long been known as lands of fish and rice, but the amount of imported foreign rice and American wheat is astounding according to customs statistics. If a nation that consumes rice and produces rice cannot supply its own needs, how can it be called an agricultural country? In fact, based on the facts, it is not really a matter of insufficient supply. Take Hunan province as an example. It is traditionally rich in rice, and the price of each shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice does not exceed four yuan. Hunan and Guangdong are neighbors. Guangdong lacks rice and has a surplus of salt, while Hunan is the opposite. Why can't Hunan's rice be transported to Guangdong, and Guangdong's salt be transported to Hunan? It is because the Yuehan Railway has not yet been completed, and the national highway has not started construction, making transportation very difficult. Otherwise, if Guangdong's salt could be exchanged for Hunan's rice, wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone? It is only because the roads are difficult to travel that they cannot support each other, and tens of millions of dollars flow out of the country each year. There are many other provinces like this, and the cause of economic decline lies in this. Once, when flying by plane from Beijing to Ping, to Han, to Anhui and Jiangsu, looking down at the plains, three thoughts—amazement, admiration, and shame—arose in my mind regarding the accomplishments of our ancestors. What was I amazed by? Recalling the prehistoric era, from nomadic life to cities, how many people's careful planning did it take to create this beautiful land and prosperous city? What was I admiring and ashamed of? Our ancestors worked hard and identified the correct directions to transform a vast and desolate land into a civilized nation. Unexpectedly, their descendants, after thousands of years, have not only failed to continue their achievements and carry them forward, allowing the country's economic arteries to connect and become a world model, but have also gradually lost the original appearance of the old system. Looking back at rising countries, in just a few hundred years, they have become increasingly prosperous. Compared to our vast ancient country, we are lagging behind in everything. Therefore, after being amazed and admiring our predecessors, we cannot help but feel deeply ashamed. Furthermore, the purpose of this association's past membership drives and meetings has not only been to hope for the development of the association's affairs, but also to make people across the country understand the relationship between road administration and the nation, and how important it is to urge provincial governments to continue their efforts in the construction of national, provincial, and county roads, so that goods can be circulated in peacetime and mobilization can be quick in wartime. This time, I am willing to follow behind the team leaders and do my best to make this membership drive stand out. This is what I dare to wish for."</p>
<p>Following reports on the methods for forming teams by preparations directors Wu Kaisheng and Wu Shan, Chairman Wang stood up and, together with over a hundred staff members, shouted "Long live the Republic of China" three times and announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Ishii Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Tang Huisun's Return to China is Scheduled</h3>
<p>Second Day of Next Month</p>
<p>Former Director of Agricultural Affairs for the three provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, Tang Huisun, went to Europe in 1930 to study agricultural administration, economics, and cooperative societies. He visited over twenty countries, including England, Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium, and stayed in Germany for the longest period. In 1931, the National Government participated in the Czechoslovak International Agricultural Conference and specially appointed Mr. Tang as its representative. Mr. Tang has already boarded an Italian ship to return to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around October 2nd. At that time, people from all walks of life will welcome him at the port. Mr. Tang graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and studied agricultural administration at the graduate school of the University of Berlin. He was also commissioned by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to inspect agriculture in various countries and served as a professor at Zhejiang University. He has written extensively on agricultural topics and has a wealth of knowledge. This trip to Europe has added to his experience. After returning to China, he will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the organization and construction of China's agricultural administration.</p>

<h3>Lü Bichou's Reply to the Letter from the All-Zhejiang Association</h3>
<p>Expressing Determination to Ban Opium</p>
<p>Letter from the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department to the All-Zhejiang Association: In reply to your esteemed letter, we received your letter and acknowledge your suggestions for improving opium prohibition in Zhejiang Province. We are deeply impressed by your thorough and insightful considerations. Our responses are as follows: (1) Regarding the strategy for opium prohibition, in the past, the police officers handling opium prohibition were lax, which is undeniable. It is now stipulated that opium prohibition committees be established in each county and city, consisting of representatives from the Party headquarters, county and city governments, public security organs, local courts, self-government organizations, and local enthusiastic opium prohibition advocates appointed by the county and city governments. Their task is to assist and supervise opium prohibition. At the same time, the county bureaus and self-government organizations at all levels are still responsible for investigation and prohibition. (2) Regarding the crackdown on public officials who use opium, anyone can report public officials who smoke opium. Recently, it has been stipulated that public officials must provide a guarantee from three or more people at the same level, guaranteeing that they do not use opium. As for detoxification centers, since there are many public and private hospitals in the provincial capital, we plan not to establish them specifically for the time being. (3) Regarding the search for trafficking, the current regulations are also strictly defined. Regardless of whether there is a passport or seal, all should be subject to inspection. If drugs are found on transportation facilities and private transportation means, the responsible personnel will also be punished to ensure mutual supervision. (4) Red pills are easy to carry and their sales are widespread. This office has long been aware of this and has already formulated measures to prohibit the consumption of red pills. Those who violate this regulation will be punished and forced to quit before being released. Regarding the matters reported in the newspapers, Lanxi County has been ordered to seriously investigate and arrest offenders. (5) Regarding the prohibition of planting poppies, this province has always followed the law by requiring each county magistrate to personally inspect the planting and emergence of opium seedlings each year. However, the area under the jurisdiction of a county is vast, and it is difficult to keep a close watch. The county magistrate is responsible for the overall affairs of the county and cannot always be outside for inspections. Public security organs are also not established in every township. Therefore, it is stipulated that from this office down to the village heads, each should inspect the areas under their jurisdiction to ensure thoroughness and avoid omissions. We also emphasize large-scale publicity and prohibition before planting to eliminate the problem beforehand. In short, as long as I, Lü Bichou, am in office, I will be determined to enforce the prohibition and live up to your expectations. I hope you will understand and provide guidance at any time to ensure progress. Sincerely, I extend my public friendship to the All-Zhejiang Association.</p>

<h3>Special Party Headquarters of Various Railways</h3>
<p>Respond to Responsible Transportation</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Railways issued the responsible transportation policy, the two railways (Likou-Zhejiang and Shanghai-Hangzhou) first implemented it. Now, successive telegrams of support have been received from the special party headquarters of various railways. For example: (1) The Special Party Headquarters of the Nanxun Railway sent a telegram to the two railway party headquarters, stating: "It has been found that the Ministry of Railways stipulated that railways should implement responsible transportation, the intention is to facilitate the people, support industry, develop national capital, eliminate private monopolies. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai transportation industry and the Shanghai-Hangzhou transfer industry did not understand the general situation and rose up to oppose, only caring about local interests and disregarding the overall national policy. This is in great contradiction to the purpose of the Ministry of Railways to implement responsible transportation. We still hope that it will be corrected so that responsible transportation can proceed smoothly. Our association will fully support it, and we are sending this telegram to report it." (2) The Special Party Headquarters of the Longhai Railway telegraphed: "We have respectfully received your telegram and attachments. The reasons you provided are stern and correct. Our association deeply sympathizes. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Railways to adhere to the original plan and persist to the end, we are replying." (3) The Special Party Headquarters of the Jinpu Railway telegraphed: "After the Ministry of Railways implemented the responsible transportation plan for freight cars, it increased revenue for state-owned enterprises and reduced various difficulties for merchants, which is beneficial to both national economy and people's livelihood. However, the Shanghai transportation industry and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo transfer industry are still clinging to long-term monopolies, and the transportation industry has wantonly issued declarations to undermine national administrative plans, which is a contemptuous act. We admire your association's declaration refuting and explaining to all sectors. In addition to sending a telegram of support, we are sending this telegram in reply." The text of each telegram is not recorded due to its length.</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, over 300 new ticket sellers of British public buses have recently been angered by the company's poor treatment and the issuance of whips to White Russian ticket inspectors to beat workers. They put forward four demands and negotiated with the company, but were rejected. After the workers' representatives convened a meeting yesterday, they decided to go on strike collectively starting this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representative Conference: Twenty-one representatives of the ticket sellers, including No. 25, held a meeting at the Xinan Hostel on Connaught Road yesterday. The chairman, employee No. 179, reported that the workers' demands had been rejected by the company and asked how to deal with the situation. It was decided that all employees would go on strike collectively starting this morning to awaken the company. It was also decided to form a strike committee, electing twenty-one members, including Nos. 246, 256, and 254, to convene a general meeting of all workers at 5:00 AM this morning at the factory gate on Connaught Road to discuss the way forward.</p>
<p>Strike Discipline: In order to ensure a tight organization, the strike committee decided on four strike disciplines yesterday: (A) Absolutely obey the orders of the strike committee; (B) Do not return to work without the order of the strike committee; (C) No other organizations are allowed outside the strike committee; (D) Those who violate the strike discipline will be dealt with severely.</p>
<p>Request for Assistance: In order to increase their strength and seek final victory, the striking workers elected employees Nos. 247 and 246 yesterday to contact the drivers and coppersmiths, asking them to participate together. They also elected employee No. 254 to contact the former ticket sellers who had not returned their uniforms, asking them to join in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Over Four Hundred Workers of Sanyou Factory</h3>
<p>Went to Beijing to Petition Yesterday Morning, Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Dispatched Personnel to Earnestly Persuade</p>
<p>Workers Accepted the Advice and Waited for the Municipal Government to Handle</p>
<p>Security Police at the North Station Were Heavily Armed</p>
<p>Workers of the Sanyou Industrial Company in Yinxianggang, Pudong, in view of the fact that the employer refused to pay for their meals, although Party and government agencies repeatedly mediated, to no avail. Therefore, the workers automatically gathered over four hundred people yesterday to go to Beijing by train to petition. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>Workers' Departure: At 5:15 AM yesterday, over four hundred workers, wearing "Petition Delegation" badges, set off from Yinxianggang. They elected Lian Xinzhi, Qin Changgeng, Li Jinbao, Zhu Hongmo, Wu Renfu, and Li Hongbin as representatives and carried a letter to Director Chen of the two railways, requesting permission to ride the train. At that time, over fifty workers who arrived first had already entered the North Station and gathered.</p>
<p>North Station Under Alert: When the workers entered the North Station, a large number of security and police brigades suddenly arrived to maintain order. The main passes and gates of the North Station were heavily guarded. The security and police brigades were fully armed to prevent accidents. Upon hearing the news, the Public Concession police also dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives, and a red security car drove to the boundary road for defense. Seeing that more and more workers were gathering, the security brigade feared that accidents might occur, so they instructed the workers to temporarily rest in remote areas around the North Station.</p>
<p>Authorities' Advice: Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, received a secret order from his superiors. At about 6:00 AM yesterday, he took a car to the Cotton Weaving Industry Association of the Seventh District in Yinxianggang to inquire about the situation. Learning that the workers had gone to Beijing to petition, Director Wang, together with Xia Zhongzhao and Bao Boyi, directors of the Labor Union, took a car to the North Station to persuade the workers. Wang Xianqing summoned the six representatives and explained that he was ordered by the mayor to come and advise the workers. He said that a large number of people going to Beijing to petition seemed to interfere with order and security. It would be sufficient to send only a few representatives to Beijing. The Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs were very concerned about the Sanyou labor unrest, and he would immediately go to the Municipal Government to report to the mayor to handle the dispute as soon as possible. Subsequently, Ye Xianggao, a representative of the General Labor Union, also arrived at the North Station and asked the workers to accept Director Wang's advice. He also said that the General Labor Union had sent representatives to Beijing to petition, and the Sanyou dispute would definitely be resolved in a short period of time. Seeing the authorities' sincere advice, the representatives expressed their acceptance on the spot. Then, the six representatives informed the workers, and then the police escorted them back. The North Station's security also returned to normal after the workers left.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Closing the Local Self-Government Training Institute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously established the Local Self-Government Training Institute to train local self-government personnel, hiring experts to recruit and train trainees in stages. It was suspended after the January 28th Incident. Although the last batch of trainees could not complete their studies, several hundred graduates had already emerged from the institute, which was sufficient to allocate and use. Furthermore, due to the city's financial difficulties, it was impossible to maintain the institute. Therefore, the Municipal Government issued instructions to the institute yesterday to close it down within a set period of time and prepare for handover. The text of the order is as follows: "This is an order to comply with the matter. This institute was suspended after the January 28th Incident this year. Now, due to the city's financial difficulties, it should be closed down quickly to clear the procedures. Therefore, this order is hereby issued to the institute to handle the closure within a set period of time, and transfer the documents, books, and equipment separately to the Municipal Education Bureau to be jointly received and stored by the Shanghai Municipal Self-Government Preparatory Committee. This order is issued separately, and compliance is required."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Aviation</h3>
<p>Reasons for Delayed Inauguration</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Beijing-Pingjin route began operating for half a year, but due to income not covering expenses, and because the Taishan area had frequent clouds and fog, and the climate was hazy, making flying exceptionally difficult, an accident occurred resulting in the death of the poet Xu Zhimo. Therefore, the company resolutely decided to</p>
<p>move east of Shandong, from Nanjing east to Shanghai, from Xuzhou east to Haizhou, from Haizhou east to Qingdao, and from Qingdao to Tianjin. As Tianjin and Beijing are close, it is easy to travel from Tianjin to Beijing, so there is no need to fly to Beijing again. Currently, the company is actively planning. It is rumored that the Qingdao airport is being constrained by the Japanese and it is difficult to land there, otherwise this route could have already been inaugurated.</p>
<h3>Leprosy Expert Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Bomb in a Box</h3>
<p>Valuable Foreign Gifts</p>
<p>Done by the Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Corps</p>
<p>Warning to Huasheng Foreign Goods Store</p>
<p>Entrusted to a Shaoxing Boat Owner for Delivery</p>
<p>Seized by Water Patrol Officers</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Huasheng Foreign Goods Store in Luodian Town, Baoshan County, has continued to purchase large quantities of Japanese goods in Shanghai, secretly transporting them to the town for sale via Xu Deyi's Shaoxing boat. Recently, the Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Corps discovered the truth and repeatedly sent letters warning them not to sell Japanese goods, but the store owner ignored them. At around 7:00 PM the night before last, Xu Deyi's Shaoxing boat was docked on the northern river surface of Lao Zha Bridge in the Suzhou River when a young man arrived, holding a wooden box, and handed it to Xu to take to Luodian and give to Huasheng Foreign Goods Store. Xu did not suspect anything and took the wooden box, placing it in the cabin. The young man then left. Not long after, police officers Yin Zhennan and Liu Yulin of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team passed by and boarded Xu's boat to check for contraband. They found the wooden box in the cabin with the words "Valuable Gifts" written on it in red ink. Suspicious, they opened the wooden box and found a bomb inside, along with two letters. One letter was addressed to the owner of Huasheng Foreign Goods Store, stating that a valuable gift box had been sent and asking him to check it. It warned that if he persisted in selling Japanese goods, he would be blown up. The other letter was addressed to Xu Deyi, the Shaoxing boat owner, warning him not to transport Japanese goods again, or his boat would be sunk. Both were signed by the Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Corps. The boat owner Xu Deyi was detained, and the evidence was taken to the Second Squad and then to the Nanshi Headquarters. Chief Zhu interrogated Xu briefly and ordered a report to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Water Bills</h3>
<p>Users Rise in Opposition</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Three Letters</p>
<p>Those Occupying Half Their Rent</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Has Not Replied</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession sent another letter to Mr. Jones, Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, regarding the water bill issue. It stated: "Sir, according to a letter from Shanghai Huaan Water and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., the water fee in the Public Concession used to be calculated at 75/1000 of the rent. We manage 52 houses in Helin Lane, Yulin Road, Eastern District, collecting a monthly rent of 981 silver dollars, and the water fee was only 73.57 silver dollars. Also, in He'an Lane at the intersection of Yulin Road and Huasheng Road, we manage 25 houses, collecting a monthly rent of 336.60 silver dollars, and the water fee was only 25.24 silver dollars. However, since the installation of water meters, the invoice from the water company, calculated from June 30th to July 26th, for Helin Lane was 346.75 silver dollars, for a period of less than one month, almost five times the previous monthly water fee. For He'an Lane, it was 143 silver dollars, almost six times the previous amount. This is not only unreasonable but ridiculous. Currently, both Chinese and foreign landlords are opposing it and have not paid the fee. If this is not resolved, it may lead to unrest. We request that your association, representing all Chinese taxpayers, quickly find a way to negotiate a resolution. We eagerly await your action." Furthermore, Zhenji Company wrote: "Our company has six storefronts located at No. 499 to 509 Ningbo Road. The water used was originally calculated according to the rent. The total monthly rent collected is 200 silver dollars, and the monthly water fee paid was 15.40 silver dollars according to regulations. Starting in June of this year, the water company abolished the old system, installed water meters, and the water fee for the second half of June was calculated at 26 silver dollars. Unexpectedly, the bill for July increased to 60 silver dollars, more than three times the previous water fee. The bill for August was even higher, at 71.88 silver dollars, more than four times the previous bill, accounting for one-third of the rent collected, which is unbearable. Therefore, our company has temporarily stopped paying the water fee for the past two and a half months. We are writing to your association to investigate and request that you forward this letter to the Public Works Department and consult with the water company to restore the old system, so as to alleviate our burden. We sincerely rely on your public spirit." In addition, lawyer Du Xuewen wrote: "According to our client, Yidetang, we own Yiqing Lane houses located near the intersection of Pingliang Road and Shenglu Road, including our residence, only 13 houses in total. Each house rents for only about 10 silver dollars, totaling a monthly rent of 230 silver dollars. Before June of this year, we paid a monthly water fee of 26.35 silver dollars, which was already burdensome. Unexpectedly, the water company recently implemented a meter system, and the bill for July reached as high as 112 silver dollars, accounting for half of the total rent of the lane, which is shocking. We only have Yiqing Lane houses. Since the Shanghai war, the tenants have been in arrears with their rent for an average of more than four months, and the miscellaneous expenses related to the lane cannot be reduced by a single penny, which is already unbearable. If we have to bear this huge water fee, bankruptcy is inevitable. If we pass this water fee on to the tenants, they will refuse to pay because they cannot afford it. After thinking it over again and again, we have no way to protect ourselves. Therefore, we have entrusted your lawyer to write to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to urgently negotiate with the Public Works Department and request that the bureau order the water company to immediately abolish the water meters and continue to charge fees according to the previous method, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people and maintain their livelihoods." In view of the above, and because this association has received repeated reports regarding the sharp increase in water fees, and has written to your bureau requesting a quick resolution, but has not received a reply regarding the handling of the matter, we are very anxious. Therefore, we are writing to your bureau again to request a quick resolution. Otherwise, those responsible for managing public utilities will inevitably be blamed for careless management and disregard for public interests, and your bureau will be even more responsible for the rise of major disputes.</p>
<h3>Aitang Village</h3>
<p>Communist Party Members Escorted to Nanjing for Trial</p>
<p>The counter-revolutionary Communist Party members Cai Fei, Xu Huishan, Li Asheng, Jiang Zhixing, Yu Ailin, and Liu Kuiyuan, among others, were previously arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the French Concession police in connection with reactionary cases and the murder of the entire family of Gu Yanzhang in Aitang Village, Yaozhu Cathedral, French Concession. They were escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and then to Nanjing for trial. They were then handed over to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, which sentenced them to various terms of imprisonment and sent them to prison. Now, the Military Justice Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Jiangsu Provincial Government have found that Cai and the other six have other cases related to them, and have requested the Central Party Headquarters to issue a document to the Third Branch Court to transfer Cai and the others to be brought to justice and tried. Currently, Huang Kai, an official from the Organization Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, has come to Shanghai, accompanied by Inspector Tang Bao from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and three detectives. At 9:00 AM yesterday, they went to the Third Branch Court to transfer the prisoners. Guo Dezhang, Acting Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division, along with Judges Zhao and Fan, and Clerk Huang Lixiang, took their seats in the Third Criminal Court. They ordered the police to bring Cai and the other six forward, briefly interrogated them, and then handed them over to the representatives to be taken to Nanjing for trial.</p>
<h3>Assault on Father Case Judgement</h3>
<p>Lu Jinbao Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lu Gengtao, a local resident, used to work as a Red Gang tailor. Last year, he sold the ancestral property to his nephew Lu Changming, and his son Lu Jinbao demanded a share, but Gengtao refused, leading to resentment. On the 15th of this month, the Mid-Autumn Festival, he used a wine bottle to injure his father Lu Gengtao under some pretext. The police investigated and arrested Jinbao and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the sentence was announced by Judge Liu Yugui in the Summary Court. The defendant Lu Jinbao was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. However, the defendant declared in court that he was not satisfied and would appeal.</p>
<h3>Huang Nianqu and</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Cohabitation with a Dancer</p>
<p>Gu Yangshan Accuses Huang of Abducting His Daughter</p>
<p>Huang Nianqu, a wealthy young man from Xin Dai Town, Pinghu, is in his youth and is fond of women. He flirts with women in Shanghai but is fickle. When he meets someone, he lives with them, but after a long time, he gets bored. Relying on his money, he gives them money to leave. He has already changed his lover four times. First, he married a woman with the surname Jian, but after living together for a long time, he became disgusted and gave her 500 mu of land and 4,000 silver dollars to live separately. He also met a woman named Zhou Ruixian and lived with her for a short time, giving her 5,000 gold coins to leave and find another lover. This happened five years ago, in 1928. At that time, there was an old Suzhou man named Yi Yangshan living at No. 46, Caishi Street, Dongxin Bridge, French Concession. He had a daughter named Su Zhen, who was only fifteen years old that year. She was just beginning to bloom and had some beauty. She was learning to dance. In April of that year, she met Huang in the Dadong Dance Hall and was immediately seduced. Gu's daughter Su Zhen was young and easily bewitched, and they had a physical relationship. Later, Huang rented a house at No. 292 Jin Shenfu Road (next to Darcy Motors) in the French Concession to hide her away, not allowing her to go home. Gu Yangshan searched everywhere for his daughter after she disappeared, but to no avail. Helpless, he let it go. Huang and Su Zhen lived together until February of this year when he became tired of her and met another woman named Dai Baoqin, abandoning Su Zhen. Su Zhen waited for Huang to come home until the end of May, but still did not see Huang. Unable to sustain herself, she had no choice but to go home and tell her father the truth, crying. Only then did Gu learn that his daughter had been abducted by Huang for four or five years. He wanted to find Huang to reason with him but could not meet him. He found two photos of Huang, Su Zhen, and Dai together as evidence and hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court, accusing Huang of enticing a young girl in violation of Articles 257, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and requesting that he be brought to justice according to the law. The court, based on the complaint, summoned the defendant yesterday, but he did not appear. Only the plaintiff Gu Yangshan, accompanied by his daughter and lawyer Wu Baotai, arrived at the court. At 3:00 PM, Judge Li Changnian opened the First Criminal Court for trial. The plaintiff father and daughter recounted the circumstances of the abduction. The court, because the defendant was absent, ordered a further summons to be issued for verification.</p>
<h3>Film Actress</h3>
<p>Tan Ying Sues for Seduction Case</p>
<p>Gu Baosen Reports to the Court</p>
<p>Released on Bail</p>
<p>The case of film actress Tan Ying suing architect Gu Baosen for seduction was repeatedly heard by Judge Shi of the District Court. Because Gu Baosen repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned, Judge Shi issued an arrest warrant twice. The defendant was captured, and the case could not proceed. Tan Ying's lawyers, Zhang Chongding and Xu Qinnan, requested an arrest warrant to be issued according to the law, which was approved. A warrant was issued, and the case was suspended. Months passed, and the public gradually forgot about it. The defendant, Gu Baosen, recently hired lawyers Wang Youling and Liu Zhen to voluntarily surrender to the District Court. Judge Shi, who was handling the case, had already died of illness, and Judge Huang Changyuan was reassigned. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he opened the court for trial. However, because it was sudden, Tan Ying, her mother Tan Wang, and her lawyer Zhang Chongming were unable to attend. Only lawyer Xu Qin was present on behalf of the plaintiff. Lawyer Liu was present for the defendant. Judge Huang asked the plaintiff about the accusations based on the complaint. Gu Baosen denied having any physical relationship with Tan Ying. Judge Huang scheduled another hearing for a comprehensive trial. The plaintiff's lawyer stood up and said that because the defendant had repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned, there was a risk of him absconding and requested that he be detained. Judge Huang approved this and ordered the defendant to provide a reputable shopkeeper as guarantor. If no guarantor could be found, he would be detained. As soon as he left the court, Gu Baosen completed the bail procedures. He had already prepared the bail bond and submitted it on the spot. After the court sent a bailiff to investigate, he was released.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Three Silk Factories</h3>
<p>Strike Erupted Yesterday But Was Quickly Resolved</p>
<p>Female Workers Expressed Dissatisfaction with the Factory's Extension of Working Hours</p>
<p>Resumption of Work at 2:30 PM After Mediation by the Union</p>
<p>Female workers in silk factories in Hongkou went on strike yesterday due to the factory's extension of working hours. Fortunately, the union received the news and sent personnel to mediate. Work resumed at 2:30 PM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Outbreak of Strike: The Tongwei, Yujing, Yichang, and other factories on Wuzhou Road in Hongkou extended working hours, causing dissatisfaction among female workers. They repeatedly negotiated with the factory but were ignored. The female workers then requested the union to negotiate with the factory, but there were no concrete results. As a result, yesterday afternoon, the female workers of Tongwei, Yujing, and Yichang factories spontaneously went on strike, demanding that the factory maintain the original working hours. Because no one from the factory came forward to negotiate, they went to the Yuncheng Silk Factory on Tiantong Road to request the female workers of that factory to join them. The factory's management, fearing unexpected disputes, immediately sent all the female workers in the factory outside.</p>
<p>Union Mediation: After receiving the news, the Fourth District Silk Industry Union sent Zhu Xizhang and Le Xiaorong to persuade the female workers. Later, the female workers demanded that the factory be restricted from extending working hours. The two representatives negotiated with the Tongwei and other factories based on the female workers' demands. The factory, fearing that the dispute would escalate, immediately accepted the demands.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: After the union representatives received the factory's reply, they sent female supervisors to the female workers' residences, instructing them to resume work immediately. The female workers, having achieved their goal, returned to the factory at 2:30 PM and announced the resumption of work.</p>
<h3>Telephone Users Association</h3>
<p>Representatives Petition the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Secretary Mackintosh of the Public Works Department Received Them</p>
<p>Promised to Convey Their Concerns to the Director-General for Consideration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Telephone Users Association convened a general meeting to discuss ways to deal with the company's price increase and elected seven representatives, including Zhu Zizhe, Zhou Fuzhang, Hu Fengxiang, Sun Wenyi, Qiu Jialiang, Cai Qiaojun, and Zou Juncheng, to petition the Public Works Department of the Public Concession. The representatives gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM yesterday, carrying an official letter, and went to the Public Works Department on Fourth Ma Road to petition Director-General Jones. The letter to the Public Works Department and the petition process are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives' Petition: "Sir, regarding the telephone price increase, this association has specially sent Hu Fengxiang, Sun Wenyi, Qiu Jialiang, Cai Qiaojun, Zou Juncheng, Ye Zizhe, and Zhou Fuzhang as representatives to present the following demands to your bureau: (1) Cancel the price increase. The reasons are that when the exclusive operating contract was signed, it was impossible to foresee the external automatic telephone system encountering certain obstacles (according to the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, these obstacles were caused by the Shanghai Telephone Company's own delay in the contract), which prevented its completion as scheduled. Also, after the January 28th Incident this year, the social economy plummeted. Now that the telephone company has been approved to be exempt from fulfilling its obligation to complete the external automatic telephone system, users should have fair and factual demands and also be approved to be exempt from their obligation to increase prices; otherwise, it would be biased and disregard the fact that the social economy has plummeted. It is permanently impossible to violate the principle of retroactive effect, so as to prevent the already established rights and obligations from being shaken and causing confusion in social order. For example, if a traveler in the hotel industry has already paid the usage fee, how can they retroactively pursue an additional fee? Also, if a telephone is transferred from A to B and the transfer fee is paid according to the rules, how can they retroactively pursue the additional fee for the time when A used it? Furthermore, if a telephone is installed after the date to which the retroactive effect applies, how can they charge a fee for the time when the telephone was not in use? Wouldn't that be even more unreasonable? In addition to the representatives presenting everything in person, we respectfully request that your bureau publicly announce in writing the cancellation of the telephone price increase and declare that there will never be any retroactive measures in the future. This is our sincere hope." To the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, from the Shanghai Special District Telephone Users Association.</p>
<p>Public Works Department's Reply: The representatives gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM yesterday, took the letter to the Public Concession Public Works Department, and requested an audience with Director-General Jones. However, Jones had already left. Secretary Mackintosh received them and the representatives presented two points: (1) Shanghai has been extremely depressed since the January 28th Incident, which your bureau is well aware of. Now, suddenly adding prices on top of commercial fatigue, how can the general users bear it? According to the telephone company's notice, the price increase period started from March 27th, which is a mistake. Because the residents living in the special district are all mobile, those who have already moved to other ports, how will they collect the additional fee? Furthermore, the company did not indicate the promulgation of the new regulations in March. Only after receiving the notification in July did the users know about it. In short, the concession users vowed not to recognize this. Mackintosh replied that the price increase of the Concession Telephone Company was based on An Sheng's construction and had been approved by the bureau. It was not implemented hastily. He himself would inform the Director-General of the representatives' official letter and all the points presented and ask the telephone company to give it a careful consideration, ordering them to reply in writing. The representatives then left.</p>

(Article 13) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be amended at any time. (Article 14) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>New Site of the Special District Court Completed</h3>
<p>The First Special District District Court of the Public Concession in this city, due to the narrowness of the court site and insufficient office space, specially added four floors to the old house in the east of the court as a building for application. The new house of the court has now been completed. The court authorities will allocate the various courtrooms. For example, the eighth and ninth courtrooms have been moved to the new building. Therefore, general parties holding previously issued summonses may not be able to find the courtroom due to the change of courtroom. Also, the lawyer's lounge has been newly opened in the new building, and other offices have also been moved to the new site.</p>

<h3>Maid Commits Suicide at Zhang Shilin's Home</h3>
<p>The family of Zhang Shilin, the principal of Qingxin Middle School, Lujia浜, Dananmen, lives in the school and hired Zhao Ma (49 years old), an old woman from Changshu, as a maid. It is unknown why Zhao Ma was wronged, but she committed suicide in her bedroom the night before last. The reason could not be found out. The First Sub-Bureau of the Third District was informed and ordered Tao Rong, the head of the 27th Pudi, to report to the District Court for examination.</p>
<h3>Cook Dismissed and Angered, Attacking Maid</h3>
<p>Gathered a Crowd to Chop Her Right Leg</p>
<p>Shi Siming, a Haimentian cook at the Pianqi Public House at No. 50 Tongzhou Road, was suddenly dismissed by his employer at the end of last month, blaming Pan Guanshi, a Suzhou maid, for gossiping to the mistress. So, at 7:45 PM on the 5th of this month, he gathered his friends Wang Zhiying and Mao Huiming (also from the same county) to wait near the mansion. When Pan returned from somewhere, Mao stopped her and slapped her, and Wang pulled out an old firewood knife and struck Pan's right leg. Pan used her hand to resist and was injured, falling to the ground and calling for help. Shi Siming, fearing a major incident, quickly walked out and pretended to dissuade them. Huatou Liu Shuxun of the Jiaxing Road patrol station and Huatu of Nos. 7, 8 and 9 heard the alarm and arrested Shi and the other three, along with the murder weapon, and took them to the patrol station. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment by car. The next morning, the patrol station sent the three defendants Wang, Shi, and Mao to the First Special District Court. The plaintiff, Pan Guanshi, with a badly injured right leg limped into the court to testify. The three defendants gave evasive statements, denying the crime. It was ordered that the hearing be postponed until Pan's foot injury could be cured or a disability determined before a re-examination. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the patrol station stated that Pan's foot injury had almost completely healed and she could walk. Her employer had also dismissed her because she could not work due to the foot injury, and she wanted to return to her hometown. He requested that the case be closed. The court ordered Pan to walk around the courtroom once, noting a slight limp, and then asked her to sit down and testify. She said that Mao Huiming held her hand at the time, Wang Zhiying struck her leg with a firewood knife, and Shi Siming pretended not to know and tried to mediate. When questioned about this, the three defendants continued to deny it vaguely. Judge Fu then sentenced defendant Wang Zhiying to eight months' imprisonment, Shi Siming to six months, and Mao Huiming to two months, as a warning. The number of days in detention before the judgment was determined to be deducted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The firewood knife was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Child Brides</h3>
<p>Accusation of Rape Against Fiancé</p>
<p>Court Mediation Fails</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Further Investigation and Hearing</p>
<p>Chen Aying, a woman from Ningbo, only fifteen years old, lost her father at a young age. Last year, her mother, Chen Ren, arranged for her to marry Wu Ali, a boatman from the same village who resided at No. 9 Yuqing Lane, East Huade Road. After her mother passed away, Aying was taken care of by her aunt, Cai Ren, to await adulthood and marry Wu. This spring, during the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, following different suggestions, Aying was taken away by her fiancé, Wu, hoping that the war would stop soon. Wu did not send Aying back to Cai Ren's home. Cai Ren initially thought that life was difficult and wanted to take this opportunity to have Aying stay in Wu's family. However, unexpectedly, this unmarried couple could not live in harmony, leading to a lawsuit. Cai Ren, in the capacity of Aying's guardian, hired a lawyer to sue Wu Ali for raping her niece in the First Special District Court. According to the complaint, the defendant took Aying away under the pretext of seeking refuge and then repeatedly raped her. The defendant is already forty-four years old and full of vigor, while Aying's body is not yet developed. When she encountered pain, she resisted, so the defendant used this as an excuse to beat and insult her, and then threw her out. This happened repeatedly. Each time her relatives and friends sent her back, the defendant refused to accept her. Since Aying has not reached the age of marriage and has not formally married, even if she is temporarily living as a child bride, she has no legal obligation to engage in sexual intercourse. Moreover, she has no family relationship with the defendant, and her consent was not obtained during the engagement. Therefore, the defendant's crime of rape cannot be mitigated by an invalid marriage contract. The plaintiff requested that the defendant be punished according to the law and, in addition, filed a civil lawsuit demanding that the defendant pay damages or alimony of 500 yuan, and requested the return of all the clothes Aying left in the defendant's house. Previously, Judge Wu Tingqi held a court hearing and summoned the parties. According to the plaintiff Cai Ren's testimony, she repeatedly sent Aying back, but the defendant Wu Ali refused to accept her. However, according to Wu's testimony, Aying actually ran away and the plaintiff never sent her. How could there be any reason for refusal? The judge then instructed the two parties to mediate outside the court. Yesterday afternoon, the court reopened, and it was learned that the mediation outside the court had been unsuccessful. Therefore, an attempt was made to mediate in court, ordering the plaintiff to immediately hand Aying over to the defendant to take away. However, upon hearing the order, the plaintiff showed a difficult expression, and her lawyer immediately stated that if the girl were returned to the defendant, she would inevitably be subjected to further abuse, expressing strong opposition. Thereupon, the defendant's lawyer, Wang Xianggu, seeing that mediation was unsuccessful, filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff, alleging that the plaintiff's accusation of rape was a false accusation and claiming that Aying actually ran away and was never driven away, and that the police station had been notified, which could be investigated. Judge Wu then ordered the case to be rescheduled, pending further investigation and hearing.</p>

<h3>River Pirates in Pujiang Sentenced</h3>
<p>The bandits Zhu Chunyou and others in Pujiang gathered a group of accomplices, specializing in robbing cargo from passing barges in the Pujiang River area of ​​North and South City. They sold the stolen goods and organized a small cargo company, which was a major problem for the transportation industry. Recently, Zhu and others again used handguns to rob cotton boats in the Huangpu River and also stole more than ten pieces of clothing from the boatmen. Zhong Changsheng, who specialized in mediating stolen goods, sold them on their behalf. The Water Patrol Police discovered this and arrested the five bandits, Zhu Chunyou, Han Erliu, Zhu Youlai, Chen Asan, and Zhou Deyuan, and confiscated a handgun and eight bullets. They were transferred to the local court along with Zhong Changsheng. Because the criminals were unrepentant, Judge Guan severely sentenced them yesterday. Zhu Chunyou, Han Erliu, and Zhu Youlai were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, Chen Asan and Zhou Deyuan were each sentenced to nine years of imprisonment, and Zhong Changsheng was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Daytime Robbery Outside Xiaonanmen</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., six bandits suddenly came to the home of Chen Ronghua, a local resident at No. 20 Gaoxiangtou Lane in the abandoned neighborhood outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. They were all wearing short blue cloth shirts and trousers and spoke with a Jiangbei accent. Initially, they claimed to be visiting Ronghua's uncle at the back door. Chen's family opened the door and let them in. Unexpectedly, after entering, these people showed handguns, warning everyone to keep silent. They then said, "We are in trouble. Please help us." After saying this, they imprisoned all the men and women in the house in the side room and ordered one bandit to guard them with a gun. The remaining bandits then entered the rooms and thoroughly searched, stealing clothes and ornaments from the boxes and cabinets in the bedrooms of Chen's family and the co-residents Chen Liangqing, Li Peiji, and Liu Peishu, estimated to be worth several hundred yuan. After taking everything, they used a bed sheet to tie it into a large bundle. The remaining雜物 (untranslated) were scattered all over the ground. The bandits then carried the stolen goods and left through the back door as before.</p>

<h3>Southwest Construction Association</h3>
<p>Meeting Record of the Shanghai Association</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, and others previously initiated the China Construction Association in their personal capacities. Since its establishment, it has made considerable contributions to the theoretical research and implementation methods of various construction projects. Dr. Zeng Yi, a member of the association, established the Southwest Construction Association in Chongqing two years ago based on the association's regulations. Many local academic experts and party and government officials participated, and the association's affairs progressed considerably. Now, in order to unite talents and capital from outside Jiangxi and jointly develop the rich resources of the Southwest as a rear support for resisting aggression, Dr. Zeng Yi has been specially dispatched to organize Southwest Construction Association associations in Beijing and Shanghai. The associations in Shanghai and Nanjing were established last month, as reported in various newspapers. The Shanghai association recently held its second meeting at Zeng's residence in Meilanfang, Beile Road. More than 20 members attended and elected Li Yingbiao as temporary chairman and Zheng Yangu as secretary. They passed the articles of association and elected Li Yingbiao, Zheng Yangu, Yuan Shuibo, Hu Kongjia, Jian Boliang, Ma Renkan, and Wen Disheng as seven directors. The directors then held a meeting and elected Li Yingbiao, Yuan Shuibo, and Zheng Yangu as standing directors. They also proposed to allocate British Boxer Indemnity funds to build the Sichuan-Guangdong Railway to unlock the key to the rich resources of the Southwest and serve as a rear support for resisting aggression, as the burden of the Boxer Indemnity is very heavy on the people of the Southwest. Allocating a portion of it for this purpose is also very appropriate. Dr. Zeng Yi of the association is currently staying in Shanghai for recuperation due to a cold and will return to Sichuan after recovering to report to the headquarters and urge the Sichuan authorities to actively prepare for the establishment of a construction research institute as a vanguard for the development of Sichuan's industry.</p>

<h3>Russian Salmon Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, salmon is produced in the Russian Sea and has been sold in China for decades. When this product was first sold in Shanghai, it was only a few dozen loads per year, transported by Russians from Haishenwai. However, because of its low price and good quality, sales increased year by year. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan used economic aggression to purchase from the Russians and transport it to Shanghai. In recent years, the quantity arriving has been hundreds of thousands of loads per year. After the May Fourth and May Thirtieth incidents, Chinese merchants, hating the ferocity of the Japanese, also changed to purchasing from the Russian Hai-Man Foreign Company. Later, the May 30th and May 30th incidents occurred one after another, and Chinese merchants purchased large quantities from the Russian Xie-Yi Association. However, this salmon has the widest sales in the autumn harvest. Last year, after the Wan案 (untranslated) incident occurred, fish merchants, in order to respect their character, refused to buy enemy goods. Only Anli Foreign Company transported tens of thousands of loads, which caused misunderstandings because it was loaded on Japanese ships. It has been learned that the Salted Fish Trade Association has directly purchased 100,000 loads of salmon from Soviet Russia, managed by the Russian Xie-Yi Association, with remittances from the Bank of China and direct transportation on Chinese ships, with certification documents from our country's consuls. It is heard that one ship has already arrived in Shanghai today.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Sir, Regarding the news item about the rent reduction in Changchunfang, Qiujiang Road, published in today's newspaper, there are two errors: (1) The "rent reduction period" is from June 1st of this year to the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, not from July 1st; (2) The "rent reduction percentage" is a reduction of 20% of the original rent, not 30%. The above two points may be due to rumors. Please correct them. Sincerely, To the Shen Bao, Lawyer Tao Wuzhi, September 20th.</p>

<p>Two-One Branch Talk (column name)</p>
<h3>August Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Although the autumn begonia is herbaceous, it adorns the corners of walls and courtyards in August like embroidery. I imagine that the full bloom of spring is nothing more than that, so the autumn begonia is also called August Spring.</p>
<p>The begonia regrets that it cannot be fragrant, which is a flaw of the flower. Whether it is the woody spring begonia or the herbaceous autumn begonia, although they are born delicate and beautiful, they do not have a fragrant aroma. The ancients said that one of the three regrets in life is that the begonia is not fragrant, along with the multi-boned鰣魚 (untranslated) and Zeng Zi-gu's inability to write poetry, forming the three regrets. However, the begonia is not really unable to be fragrant. According to the Records of Lingnan, the autumn begonias of Qingyuan Guiyuan Cave and the spring begonias of Zhaoqing Lingyang Gorge are all fragrant. Unfortunately, they are far away in Lingnan, and I cannot go to admire them, which is also a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>The autumn begonia is called the "Heartbreak Flower" and the "Lovesickness Grass." These are all materials for tragic love novels. In fact, plants and trees are emotionless, so how can they have a broken heart or lovesickness? It's all just talk. I saw in the Zhangzhou Zhi that: "The autumn begonia produces seedlings every year, and its stem is very brittle. The back of the leaf has red, messy patterns, said to be the blood of lovesickness. Legend has it that in the past, someone喷血 (untranslated) from lovesickness under the steps, and this flower grew, so it is also called Lovesickness Grass," and so on. This passage is a ridiculous embellishment, but it provides material for poets to chant, and has the same interest as Xiangfei bamboo.</p>
<p>The autumn begonia has two kinds, red and white. The red one is tender and bright, and the white one is elegant and clean. Red autumn begonias can be made into honey, and the method is recorded in the Ci Hang Huo Ren Shu. It is said that: use a large cup of white honey, take red autumn begonia petals, fill the honey with the petals, lightly pound the flowers, steam and dry them several times until they are as rotten as mud. Its honey color is like begonia, or add a little good hibiscus powder, it is extremely lovely and prevents the face from freezing and cracking.</p>
<p>Zhou Zi said: "Chrysanthemum is the hermit among flowers; peony is the wealthy among flowers; lotus is the gentleman among flowers." I will add a sentence: autumn begonia is the anti-Japanese among flowers.</p>
<p>How can the autumn begonia be said to be anti-Japanese? There is a book to prove it. The Qun Fang Pu records the properties of the autumn begonia in these five words: "It likes shade and hates the sun." For this reason, we should pay a considerable tribute to August Spring.</p>
<h3>North and South Poles</h3>

<h3>September 18th, 21st Year: Composed in Grief</h3>
<p>Zhu Zun</p>
<p>Countrymen were shocked to tell each other, it's another September 18th. Last year, September 18th, Manchuria was seized at night. The party and state leaders, took the stage and spoke with fervor. Vowing to restore national sovereignty, and not to cede an inch of land. This year, September 18th, the bandit recognized the Manchukuo. Rehe is in urgent danger daily, enemy planes鳴軋軋 (onomatopoeia). The party and state leaders, still speaking with fervor. Vowing to recover lost territory, and that the puppet state must be conquered. From last year to this year, not a single soldier has been dispatched. Next year, September 18th, I don't know what to say. The strong enemy relies on violence daily, and the Xia are fighting more fiercely. Not only are the strong藩 (untranslated) divided, but the central government is also splitting. Mouths call out to comrades, hearts are each wielding axes. The enemy's momentum is like pouring water, our politics is as messy as hair. How can the national destiny last long, the sun and moon grieve with urgency. I don't know how many times September 18th can be said. (Yet I compensate)</p>
<h3>Initiator</h3>
<p>— Shi Weilie</p>
<p>"Donating to Volunteer Armies and Buying Horse Racing Tickets"</p>
<p>Driven by conscience, and suddenly feeling guilty before the divine, although my home was destroyed in the January 28th Incident, I am still living my life of mediocrity in peace. Thinking of the volunteer armies that attacked Shenyang three times, they are fighting for the motherland and seeking national survival under a rain of bullets and artillery fire, which is also giving our compatriots in the pass a way to survive in flesh and blood: How should we, the people in the pass, do our best for them and be a strong backup? With this in mind, in the office, I initiated fundraising to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army, regardless of the amount, just seeking to help. But the result was miserable. Zhang said it was inconvenient, Li said the family's expenses were not enough. Tao, who has the nickname of "Little Kai," smiled and said to me: "Save it,阿戇 (untranslated), wouldn't it be better to go to Guanshengyuan to buy Cantonese mooncakes with the money?"</p>
<p>Today, Lin from the receiving and dispatch department walked into our office with a huff and a puff, and said with a hundredfold spirit: "Hey, who wants to get rich? The time to buy horse racing tickets is here again, who wants to buy it, please sign up and pay."</p>
<p>Enviable Lin, after his rallying cry, everyone responded readily. Zhang paid five yuan, and so did Li. In addition to sharing eight yuan within the公股 (untranslated), Tao Xiaokai bought two more tickets alone, totaling twenty-eight yuan.</p>
<p>Alas, heaven, the fortune and misfortune of the initiator is like this!</p>
<h3>The Creator of the Regular Script Movable Type Edition</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>丨The Esteemed Calligrapher Mr. Zheng Wuchang丨</p>
<p>Printing is the only undertaking for the development of civilization. In ancient China, records and legends were initially made using leather and lacquer, followed by bamboo slips. From the Qin and Han dynasties onwards, paper, brushes, and ink appeared, but all were handwritten. It wasn't until the late Tang dynasty that woodblock printing emerged, and with the invention of clay movable type by Bi Sheng in the Song dynasty, movable type printing began. As for the typefaces used in printing, they also changed with the times. During the leather and lacquer era, insect script was common; during the bamboo slip era, seal script was prevalent. Between the Qin and Han dynasties, both seal script and clerical script were used, but clerical script did not flourish because it was more convenient and practical. Thereafter, from clerical script to regular script, printing typefaces also varied between clerical and regular scripts, eventually forming what is known as Song typeface. After the Yuan and Ming dynasties, except for fine private carvings that mostly used the common regular script of the time, ordinary printing generally followed the Song typeface without improvement. Thus, printed type and handwritten type became two separate paths, and a gap arose between reading and writing. Improving printing typefaces is an urgent and crucial task in modern cultural endeavors.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Zheng Wuchang is skilled in calligraphy and painting, and has produced numerous works. He has long held the ambition to improve the printing industry to meet the needs of modern culture. The year after Hu Shih advocated for vernacular writing, he devoted himself to improving printing typefaces. He selected over 14,000 elegant and practical regular script characters, manufactured copper molds, and cast movable type. Wuchang was of humble background and disliked seeking assistance; he repeatedly stopped due to economic difficulties. However, those with ambition receive help. With the joint efforts of his friends Li Zuhan, Chen Xiaodie, and others, he has now cast six sets of large and small copper molds, casting movable type day and night, calling it the Hanwen Regular Script Movable Type Edition, which is being practically applied to printing. Elders like Cai Yuanpei and Yu Youren have highly praised it, calling it a new invention in Chinese printing tools and a major revolution in modern cultural endeavors. However, Wuchang's fight for culture has left him exhausted. Therefore, he often signs himself "The Scattered Man with Silken Temples" when painting for others, which shows his hardship.</p>
<h3>The Novel Club's Silver Threads (20)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"But your sentiments are still the same as the girl's; these past ten years or so have naturally made you feel very downcast and sad. Aren't we spiritually regaining the feeling of youth from now on? These two silver threads are enough to represent the process of our arduous lives. Please give them to me as a souvenir!" Commander Yuan reached out to take them, but Fenruo didn't give them to him.</p>
<p>"Of course, but I can't give them to you so easily."</p>
<p>"Do we need to hold some kind of ceremony?" Commander Yuan joked, and Fenruo smiled brightly.</p>
<p>"I want to use these two threads as silk thread to embroider on your portrait. The young Mr. Yuan in my mind is still the same as before. Who would have thought that Mr. Yuan's temples are already gray? If I add these two threads to the embroidery, wouldn't it be exceptionally lifelike and interesting? It's getting late. Please go to the meeting to attend the unveiling ceremony of the monument. I'll frame your portrait and complete the embroidery. When you finish the meeting, I'll ask Mr. Wang from the embroidery shop to deliver it to the meeting venue for you. You should go to the meeting now. You're already very late. Those who are eagerly praising you may be secretly scolding you for not keeping your word. Have another cup of herbal tea? Commander Yuan!"</p>
<p>"No, I hate you calling me Commander Yuan and Mr. Yuan!"</p>
<p>"I really can't understand your newly changed name. I stutter when I try to say it."</p>
<p>"Isn't it good to call me by my old name?"</p>
<p>"We haven't seen each other for more than ten years, and you've become a commander. Wouldn't it be polite to be a little more formal?"</p>
<p>"The more polite you are, the more I can't stand it."</p>
<p>"Okay! He Fu, you really should go to the meeting. Can't you listen to me this once?"</p>
<p>"How can I not listen to you? But you must tell me when we'll meet again. The sooner, the better."</p>
<p>"I expected that you would come to see me again. For the past few years, I've almost thought about it every day. Now that we've met, we'll naturally have the opportunity to meet again in the future. Agreeing on a date and time and waiting is very boring. Sudden meetings are indeed very meaningful."</p>
<p>"No, our conversation hasn't reached a conclusion yet. I want to come again early tomorrow morning to pick up this embroidered portrait myself. Please don't have anyone else hand it to me."</p>
<p>"You still shouldn't make an appointment! In the early morning, you should supervise your troops to do morning exercises. A commander who gets up early to meet his girlfriend is really improper."</p>
<p>"Then tonight?"</p>
<p>"Even more inappropriate. Let's do it during the day tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Please shake my hand and allow me to say goodbye to you calmly."</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll meet again tomorrow!" Fenruo extended her plump, boneless right hand, with a sweet smile. Commander Yuan shook it tightly and murmured, "Fen, I haven't had such a lovely scene in over ten years. Goodbye, until tomorrow. From now on, I hope you leave behind sorrow and worries, because your soul is so pure and beautiful. Fen, goodbye!"</p>

<h3>The Han-Liu War</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The nature of the Han-Liu war is unclear, it occurred suddenly, and the truth is yet to be seen. However, the international situation is very tense. Japan has just recognized the puppet state and intends to invade Jehol. With foreign troubles on the rise and internal conflicts breaking out again, the country is unfortunate, what is there to wait for?</p>
<p>According to Han's telegram, the cause of this war is that Liu Zhennian borrowed the name of raising funds to extort taxes and oppress the people, and failed to suppress bandits, but instead prevented it. However, we have no way to criticize such charges for the time being. However, with foreign disasters not yet quelled on the border and conflicts arising domestically, no matter how sufficient the reasons may be, it is shocking to hear of it.</p>
<p>However, to put it more bluntly, the country raises soldiers to defend the country. The Northeast Incident has been going on for a year, and not only has not a single inch of lost territory outside the customs been recovered, but the situation in Jehol is becoming more serious. If soldiers do not defend the country, what is the use of soldiers? Now, no matter who wins or loses in the Han-Liu dispute, the result will always solve a part of the problem.</p>
<p>The Anti-Civil War Great Alliance was abolished the other day. A meeting was held in Shanghai, and a nationwide telegram was sent to stop and settle disputes. However, before long, the war broke out again. It can be seen that declarations are ineffective, and only bloodshed will bring a conclusion. Instead of enduring and suspecting each other, it is better to fight it out and decide the winner. That would be more straightforward.</p>
<p>"No fight, no understanding" is a famous saying in the Jianghu world. Looking at past wars, the results have all led to amity. Countless precedents can be cited. From this, it can be inferred that war is not necessarily a disaster. Moreover, it is said that the 19th Route Army has outstanding war records and its experience is special. War is ultimately bad, but it is difficult to establish a country without war. War is permissible.</p>
<p>Some say that foreign disasters come from internal wars, and if internal wars are not stopped, the disasters will deepen. It is not known that frequent internal wars are like brothers fighting each other. If people do not destroy us, we will destroy ourselves. Lives are given to artillery fire, and property is exhausted in transportation. How can such a country be a country?</p>

<h3>Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Meng Shulu</p>
<p>I am utterly saddened by the bleak autumn wind. Strong neighbors have been invading year after year. In the middle of the night, I wipe Liu Kun's sword. All night long, I pace back and forth with Zu Ti's whip. Even children know the hatred of a lost country. Merchants and civilians quickly donate to the righteous army. Who can restore the broken golden bowl? I fear seeing the full moon of mid-autumn again.</p>
<h3>Occasional Composition</h3>
<p>The window lattice is filled with emptiness and whiteness,</p>
<p>Birds chirping noisily in the forest at dusk,</p>
<p>The sound of decaying leaves falling from the trees,</p>
<p>The autumn wind has conquered.</p>
<p>The perfected man has no dreams,</p>
<p>But I alone am like Zhuang Zhou dreaming of a butterfly.</p>
<p>I wish I could transform into a butterfly,</p>
<p>And fly to the front lines of the two armies.</p>
<p>The autumn wind is rustling,</p>
<p>The autumn fan is discarded.</p>
<p>I lift my head and gaze at the moon in the courtyard,</p>
<p>The moon shadow is perfectly round.</p>

<h3>How to Prevent Dyeing from Fading?</h3>
<p>— Huang Yucheng</p>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. Sheng Sanmin of Pudong and Inform Those Engaged in the Dyeing Business丨</p>
<p>On the ninth of this month, I published an article on "Fabric Printing Methods" in this publication, which unexpectedly caught the attention of reader Mr. Sheng Sanmin, who sent a letter to discuss it with me. I originally intended to write a letter directly to reply to Mr. Sheng, but considering the decline of industry and the backwardness of science in our country, there may be others who have the same questions as Mr. Sheng. It is better to take the time to write this short article and publish it in the science column, with the hope that my humble opinion will not be kept secret and that those with superior knowledge will teach me!</p>
<p>Currently, the pigments used in various dyehouses are mostly the three types of direct, basic, and acidic. Among these three types of pigments, acidic pigments fade most easily, direct pigments are better, and basic pigments, if added with tannic acid or antimony salt solutions and printed and dyed correctly, may not fade temporarily, but can never remain permanently. And they will all fade a little. If the method is improper, then they will fade even more.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether or not it fades completely depends on the pigment. If you want it to never fade, you must use the following three pigments:</p>
<p>A. Naphthol Pigments</p>
<p>B. Indanthrene Pigments</p>
<p>C. Algol Pigments</p>
<p>If the above three types of pigments are used for printing and dyeing, they will definitely not fade for a long time and you will get satisfactory results. However, the printing and dyeing method is different from when using direct, basic, and acidic pigments.</p>
<p>Regarding these differences, it is certainly impossible to describe them in a few words, and it is impossible to understand them solely through empty words without any experience. It is best for those with lofty aspirations to take the time to visit our Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company's factory for an on-site inspection in order to understand.</p>
<p>I am currently working at the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company. The company's scale is not very large, but it can be regarded as the only domestic national goods factory, and all of its products are well-praised by the Chinese people. If comrades come to visit, you can know the details. Forgive me for not being long-winded.丨</p>

<h3>Should the Weekday be Abolished?</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Under the covetous gaze of the great powers and in a country like ours, which is located in a semi-colonial position and whose national power is declining, it is necessary to seek to change and quickly implement remedies in all aspects, be it politics, economy, education... ! And education is the foundation of psychological construction, its relationship is extremely important. Yesterday, the article "Suggestions for Abolishing School Weekday Holidays" written by Mr. Zhenzhi in the Tan Yan column of this publication was written for this reason, and his patriotic enthusiasm overflows from his words, which is worthy of our admiration. However, regarding the abolition of weekday holidays, I would like to express my humble opinion, and I think readers would also be happy to hear it.</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Zhenzhi's intention was that our country's inability to become strong is actually due to the lack of promotion of science, and the lack of promotion of science is due to the low level of knowledge among the people. The low level of knowledge among the people is due to the lack of effort put into learning by the people. If we want the people to put more effort into learning, then it is appropriate to abolish weekday holidays. My opinion is different: observing countries that implement the weekday system, the knowledge of their people is not inferior, and talents have emerged repeatedly, benefiting mankind. This is especially evident in the certain imperialist country that Mr. Zhenzhi calls the most religious. According to this, it can be known that the lack of promotion of science is not due to the harm of weekday holidays, but is actually due to the improper handling of weekdays in general.</p>
<p>If schools really abolish weekday holidays, in reality it will not only be unhelpful to students, but also harmful. This is because among students, there are those who are intelligent and those who are low-ability. The intelligent ones can solve the lessons they receive every day, but the low-ability ones cannot. Therefore, the low-ability ones use the spare time on weekdays to put more effort into their lessons in order to keep up with the lessons of the intelligent ones.</p>
<p>If there are no weekdays for teachers, then life will feel very boring, and those who choose a career later will regard the education field as a daunting path. Here is a record of the impact of adopting the continuous work week on the Soviet Union, recorded by various Soviet newspapers: it can be used as collateral evidence.</p>
<p>A passage from the Tude Daily says:</p>
<p>"The new system of changing the old system to a continuous work week will inevitably cause fierce opposition from stable workers... Older women are especially strongly opposed, and they declare that Sunday must be a day of rest: to be able to travel and have fun with their husbands..."</p>
<p>The Yisidiya Daily once載:</p>
<p>"A young worker said: 'My mother rests on the first day, my father rests on the second day, my brother rests on the third day, and I rest on the fourth day. How can we work with peace of mind?'... A sickle and hammer worker replied to an interviewer from Zhenli Daily: 'Will we never have the joy of rest in the future? When our wives are in the factory, our children are in school, and friends cannot visit, we will be bored and have no choice but to enter government-run teahouses and sit there until the end of the day...'" I think that reforming the seven-day week system is permissible, but absolute abolition is not. As for how to reform it, let experts at home and abroad discuss it in detail.</p>
<h3>Liangxiang Politics</h3>

<h3>When a Man Loves Two Women</h3>
<p>— Ze Li</p>
<p>When a man loves two women, if he believes that love is noble and pure, then he must choose one that is more suitable and more genuine to be his lifelong partner; and he will never wait until the unfortunate arrival of both women reaching their highest level of passion for him. Conversely, an ambitious man simultaneously courts both of them, he is constantly worried about gains and losses, and even finds it difficult to give up either. In the end, it is either the misfortune of the other party or his own failure.</p>
<p>L, because of his activities during his school days, got to know C and Y one after another. After a long period of time, they all developed a high degree of passion. On the part of both women, each knew that there was someone other than themselves who was in love with him.</p>
<p>Y is a woman from the middle class who has lost her father, and her white-haired old mother is always hoping that she will find a satisfactory husband. Of course, L had a considerable position after coming out of school, and his elegant demeanor especially amused the old woman. Because the old woman's intentions were there, this lady focused on attacking him, and very easily they developed a physical L relationship.</p>
<p>After a woman has provided her body to the other party, she always believes that this matter is set in stone, but at this time, he absolutely does not mention marriage. After a few times of butterflies fluttering in her heart, she finally brought up this question. All she was sure of was that she had a layer of physical relationship with him more than C did. After repeated gentle requests, she thought that he would undoubtedly embrace her lightly and express infinite sympathy. However, his reply was only: "I don't think the time has come yet."</p>
<p>She naturally felt the reason for this reply and finally realized the terribleness of this environment. Resentment and jealousy filled her heart, and she resolutely left.</p>
<p>When a letter expressing sacrifice and infinite melancholy was presented to L, she had already gone to an unknown place. This is at least a responsibility. Of course, he has to try to find her for her departure. After two days of running around, there was still no trace of her, and he came to tell me. I gave him a common method: post a notice in the newspaper: all issues should wait until she comes back and then we can talk about it. At the same time, I also want to ask what he really means. This is wonderful. His answer was:</p>
<p>"I am now only driven by conscience. It doesn't matter whether I find her or not. Anyway, I have always looked for her. As for her, she knew there was a C when she met me, and she always walked towards me, leaving me in a state of wandering on a forked road. Although she has a physical relationship with me, hasn't she solved the problem of sexual desire in the same way? She can never use this to threaten me, especially her departure. To be honest, I don't owe her anything. Even if she never comes back, I just consider it as losing an ordinary thing, it doesn't matter, nothing at all?"</p>
<p>"Then how is C now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Alas, that's difficult. She hasn't sent a letter in a week or two. But I'm completely because of Y, otherwise, it wouldn't be anything difficult to ask her to come and live with me!"</p>
<p>After a while, he said again:</p>
<p>"To put it thoroughly, many women are bewitching several men at the same time, and in the end they can only marry one of them. The rest have to taste the taste of unrequited love. You think, how many young people fall and commit suicide because of this. Therefore, I am now in the middle of two women. Losing one is not a big deal, and it can even be said to represent a general man giving them a revenge. However, I am also afraid that in the end, I will not get anything!"</p>
<p>Here, I have feelings:</p>
<p>For the disappearance of a woman who has had a physical relationship with oneself, not only is there no pity, but also says that it is revenge for the average man. A woman takes risks and leaves for her own sake. This reproach on conscience is not light, right! Even if you don't speak from the standpoint of love, at least there should be some sympathy, but he is still worried about gains and losses. "Love," this driving term ah!</p>
<p>We have felt sorry for many young men who have lost love. Young men with great prospects, this rare woman problem is not worth sacrificing everything for. Now, fragile woman's heart, you have lost your body and destroyed your soul, come back quickly! You are not worth sacrificing for a hedonistic man who takes your body as the goal! Come back, Ms. Y!</p>

<h3>The Poison of Flower Gambling</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Turning into a small alley, both sides were crowded with people's heads; I thought something had happened again for breaking heads for a copper coin. I was pushing forward in the crowd, only to hear everyone's mouth saying the sound of "coming, coming." Judging from the tone, it seemed that something they had been waiting for for a long time had just arrived slowly. There was no time for me to guess. A bicycle drove from behind me. "XXX" was that person's report. The chaos was the commotion of the heads on both sides. I finally knew that flower gambling was active again. Two middle-aged women who looked like maids were walking in front of me very proudly.</p>
<p>"How much did you bet?" one asked.</p>
<p>"Not much, I'm afraid to bet, I only bet three thousand," one replied.</p>
<p>"I told you that the dead ghost is effective. I only bet three thousand. I bet fifteen thousand in total! If I don't get my money back this time, I'll jump into the Huangpu River." After speaking, she gave a proud smile.</p>
<p>They still wanted to talk about the nonsense in their dreams but they had already arrived at their doorstep, so I did not learn their art.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the harm of flower gambling. It searches for the sweat and blood money of laborers. It is said that nine copper coins can compensate for one dollar. No wonder ignorant women enjoy this and don't work hard. But where do the villas and charter buses of the flower gambling tycoons come from? Therefore, the general public starts betting with nine copper coins and goes up to fifteen thousand. They even gamble with their lives. The aforementioned maid said that if she doesn't get her money back this time, she will jump into the Huangpu River? Although I have seen the Public Security Bureau's orders in the newspaper, why haven't I seen them actually eliminate the poison of this flower gambling?</p>
