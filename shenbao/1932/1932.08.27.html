<p>時評</p>
<h3>東北問題與俄日關係華</h3>
<p>溯自東北事件發生以來。國人及歐美人士。均甚注意俄日之關係。而俄國</p>
<p>一方在遠東增兵戒備。一方則報紙對日屢加痛斥兩國間形勢。時而緊緊張。時而緩和。莫可端倪最近於日軍窺伺熱河之覷俄日風雲告緊之説。忽又甚囂塵上。近復趨于緩和。兩國關係。究竟如何雖各方面猜測不一。第就事論事。大致或如下述。</p>
<p>俄國之主義與立塲與歐美各國不同在國際間實立于孤立之境地。近方埋頭建設。進行其五年計畫。冀本自身之努力。以完成其使命。若一旦戰事勃發。不但建設工作。不能按其計畫循序進行。	抑且因孤立之故。或召他敵。危險太大職是之由。殊鮮對日即時作戰意。他姑不論。即從最　著之三項事實觀之。可見其戰意之尠小。其一。自去秋以迄最近。俄國因憤日人之暴戾。屢屢有渴盼美俄復交成爲事實之表示。察其意嚮。似美國苟不予以援助。則其對日不能有何積極行動。其二。今年一月。芳澤由法回日道經俄都。俄國當局會向表示兩國締結互不侵犯條約之意。日方雖未接受。但最近國聯調查團赴東北考查。俄方法並不與調查團合作。縱非親日實亦透露其中立態度。其三。久久未决而足使兩國發生衝突之北洋漁權問題。最近雙方己本互讓之精神。宣告解决。且據華盛頓電訊。日俄業恊定中有若干重要條件。足徵兩國間有新諒解。（條件詳昨報不贅）俄國對日。絶無急欲開戰之意。於此可見。　就日本方面論。日本目前最急切之圖。在鯨吞我東北。而欲使各國不加干涉。所有力量。均集中於此一點絲毫不肯放鬆。至於對俄開戰非其現在之要着。邇來我東北忠勇之義軍。藉青紗帳天然之便宜。積極行動。迭獲勝利。予敵以打擊。日軍疲于奔命。進窺熱河之軍隊。己裏足不前情形若此。縱欲與俄桃釁。事實上亦有所不許。俄若以武力干涉日本對我之侵略。日本或不得不與冒險一戰。今俄並無此意。且守中立態度。日本樂得以全力對付我東北何。必無端惹起對俄之衝突。且日之對俄。表面上露其狰獰之惡相。無非是施放烟幕彈之一種策略。蓋以對我侵略太甚。即不得不對俄虚張聲勢。藉防止共産主義之口實。以掩蔽其不顧條約不守信義之罪惡。而緩和歐美反日之空氣也。</p>
<p>完全從客觀立塲觀察。俄日此種關係於彼兩國實各有利益俄日暫時妥恊。日本侵我東北。不僅無須顧慮俄國之掣肘。且可以全力應付國聯與美國。此日方之利也。據哈瓦斯。十九日柏林電訊。「美國屹斯國家銀行與蘇聯政府談判以四千。萬元貸與蘇聯。德工業界聞訊頗恐慌。因借欵之數目。雖不甚鉅。將使美國承認蘇聯。且或於無形中承認取消俄國於戰前之舊債：：：」由是觀之。俄日國交。若早破裂。美或反坐觀成敗。今俄雖積極準備。以防萬一。而同時按兵不動。對日頻送秋波。反使美國不安。不得不思改變其從來對俄方策。俄國外交。極盡巧妙之能事。有能不令人驚歎者。</p>
<p>東北情形。每况愈下。而俄日關係又由緊張而弛緩。試問吾人將何以自處。就過去事實論。此問亦不難解答。何以言之過去之失敗。全在國人希望日俄日美風雲緊張。以滅削日本對我之壓力。而缺少積極奮鬥收。回失地之努力。假使我國自始抵抗。不獨俄日間關係。不致如此。即國際形熱。恐亦與今日大異。淞滬戰役。十九路軍抵抗時。國聯頗助我主張公道。美國表示不承認日本蔑棄條約之武力行動。而蘇聯報紙。亦痛詆日本横暴。當時國際空氣。確爲一變。是以今欲轉移世界對於東北問題沉寂之狀態。其實亦全在自力而不在依頼他力。據京訊。日前「中常會會討論日方針。經各委詳細討論後。結果除一方限令東北各軍準備出關。收復失地。並向日本再提嚴重警告者外一方面仍報告　聯請主持正義。制止日方侵略」吾人竊望中央。弗以後者爲重而以前者爲輕。必須雙方重。國際形勢。方可改觀。對於前者。國民亦應促央悉心策劃。一面予東北各軍以切實之接濟。一面嚴定期限。責其遵令分頭出關。母得藉故推諉。惟然國際空氣。或可於短期間轉變。而日本侵略我東北之野心。其亦可以稍嚴歟。</p>

<h3>對内田外交演説美英態度暫守沉默</h3>
<p>自衛權利竟軼出本國領土以外</p>
<p>日本縱逞狡辯終違犯九國公約</p>
<p>在調查報告未公開前</p>
<p>美國不願再有所行動</p>
<p>▲國民社二十五日華盛頓電今日美國務院認昨日日本内田外相在東京國會内演説、其本意直接對國際聯盟而發、作爲日本對滿洲地位聲明、因此美國不擬有所答復、官塲中觀察時變者以爲日本若承認滿洲僞國、縱有内田之聲辯、顯似將違犯九國公約、但又表示、	苟從法律點觀察、則此舉之是否違犯公約、將視滿州國是否可認爲眞正自主國家、抑係日本傀儡而定、料國聯調查團報告書對於此點、當能有所闡明、國務院發言人頃謂内田伯爵顯然欲向國聯及全世界概括説明日本立塲當日大使署將該演説稿抄送國務院時、國務院即向來人説明美國此種見解、記者嗣以内田伯爵所稱日本根據非戰公約之自衛權利、今乃軼出本國領土之外、擴張至滿洲一層詢問某大員據稱關於此點、國際法上未有規定、又據國務院當道最後表示、美國在聯盟調查團送出報告以前、對於遠東將來未必再有行動云、</p>
<p>▲路透社廿六日紐約電據講壇導報消息靈通之某訪員聲稱、日本之决議承認「滿洲僞國、」美國將用其勢力維持外交的排斥主義以對付之、該訪員之意、其餘各國恐亦將出此、華盛頓人士視内田伯爵之演説、乃對國聯而發、而目光則注於李頓調查團報告書、當局現己表明日本之承認「滿洲僞國」將視爲違背九國公約之舉動、惟政府己確言胡佛總統與史汀生國務卿對内田之演詞、均不欲發言以答之、在國聯對李頓調查團報告書有所行動之前、對「滿洲僞國」亦不欲發表任何言論云、紐約時報今日載有社論、謂内田伯爵所述日本在東三省行動之理由、與一九一四年德國解釋其攻入比法之舉同一口脗、内田預料九國公約舉凱洛格非戰公約有爲各國援用對日之可能、而李頓調查團之報告書、或亦不利於日、故發此演説、以爲先發制人計、此不啻與國聯權威直接劇烈挑戰云、</p>

<p>接國外要電</p>
<p>▲路透二十六日倫敦電英國大員某氏今日於路透訪員造訪時宣稱、大不列顚當視遠東全案爲在考慮中之事、英國以其國聯會員資格、現爲裁判員之一云、該員在未接李頓調查團報告書之前、不能發表對日本承認「滿洲國」之意見、及確言此舉大概之結查、渠料須至九月杪、報告書始能供國際研究、倫敦人士對日本承認「滿洲國」之舉、是否侵犯九國公約一節、意見分歧、或謂「滿洲國」他日如經衆認爲實際的政府、於是泰西列强大約將相繼承認之、果爾、則援用九國公約、顯然爲不可能云、或謂日本之承認「滿洲國、」確屬侵犯九國公約、日本如果出此、該約之簽字國應召集會議、决定對付違約者應取之步驟云、</p>
<h3>英報諷日片面解釋</h3>
<p>謂日本欲承認傀儡組織</p>
<p>顯與世界道德意識反抗</p>
<p>▲路透廿六日倫敦電此間保守黨報紙對於内田昨夜在議會所發之演詞、不置批評、惟自由黨與工黨報紙則指此演詞預示危險可能性、自由黨彚聞報謂遠東或將再起衝突、日本之在上海增兵、即爲令人惶恐之理由、内田在李頓報告書發表以前發此言論、既屬不智、亦爲缺乏考慮、日本不能期望他國接受其在東省行爲不破壞凱洛格非戰公約與其他條約之片面議論云、工黨每日驛報社論、題爲「日本之傀儡、」謂遠東現扮演一種滑稽劇、但此劇含有世界慘劇之可能性、日本之承認「滿洲僞國、」乃與世界道德意識有意反抗之最近步驟、將使戰雲彌漫天空云、孟却斯德指導報社論、題爲「滿洲國界爲滿洲之人國乎」謂就日本而言、日本對「滿洲國」之承認直故意蔑視李頓調查團之條陳耳、此舉將使國聯他國一再並永遠承認東三省時局、係爲與日本國義務大相抵觸之方法所造成、依美國務卿史汀生所唱之不承認主義、列强將在任何情形下拒絶與「滿洲國」發生關係云、　　▲國民社二十六日倫敦電每日紀事報、稱、遠東時局目下充滿危險可能性、國際聯盟不宜再有所躊躇、必須通知日本、此種藐視世界一秉良心之公論、嘵嘵置辯、乃舉世所不能容忍者、</p>
<h3>世界著名學者論未來國際政局</h3>
<p>美日戰後將引起全歐争覇戰</p>
<p>結果將樹立美國支配下局面、</p>
<p>▲東京日日新聞載麥沙邱州聯合電云、</p>
<p>十七日美麥沙邱州政治學會開夏季講演會、英國國際問題研究所所長全世界著名學者亞諾爾特·德英皮氏、發表未來的國際政局意見如下、吾人觀今日美國在國際上之孤立政策、結果必致誘發日美戰争、日美戰争後、復引起全歐争覇戰、其結果、美國將掌握世界覇權、亦未可知、蓋美國之外交政策、目下與世界各國相隔膜、而美國在太平洋上與日本正面衝突、不難想像、一旦日美開戰、則太平洋沿岸各國如中國·俄國·加拿大·澳洲·新西蘭等、勢必聯合爲美之同盟國、加入大戰、此時日本必遭大敗、惟美國雖擊敗日本、己亦不免受創、一方加入此大戰之加拿大·澳洲·新西蘭等、結果對英亦將發生重大影響、促成英帝國之崩壞、而美國既戰勝太平洋之敵、全歐洲各國咸懔懔自危、不得不一致團結以防美、此時恐釀成全世界大戰、美以兵强力足、卒能取最後勝利、至是始可樹立美國支配下之世界和平局面也、</p>
<h3>東報中之法日問題諒解觀</h3>
<p>▲世界社云、半官性質之英文日本泰晤土報昨載一社論、題曰「法日關係」、其字裏行間、不啻承認關於日本之對華政策、法日間有一諒解之存在、特爲譯布如左、我國民其注意焉、</p>
<p>日本近來忙於對滿洲及對中國之關係、無暇注意於其對其餘世界之關係、而他國則乘亞洲多事之際、時時用力注意於日本、或假手國際聯盟、或假手通牒及問詢、將來遠東時局稍定、日本或可乘暇造一清册、以揭示彼與列强間之關係、</p>
<p>在此項清册中、日本對法國之感情、將大增其熱烈友睦、殆無可疑、因若干他國之取干涉政策、法國對滿洲及上海兩事件獨賢明的取旁觀態度、乃爲顯著堪歡迎之事、</p>
<p>八月二十六號日法間之印度支那恊約開始有效、兩國間之友誼將更增一層、此項恊約爲三十年來之懸案、卒於五月三號簽字、誠爲快事、自一九二四年開始談判、本可早日解决、其所以拖延之久、半由於法國資本家之反對、彼等卜居巴黎、而投有鉅資於越南、恐恊約成立後、日貨輸入侵略彼等之特權、此固慮之成理、故恊約中載有補救之規定、雖許擴張現有之贸易、同時亦保護法國國貨之對越輸出焉、（中略）今更返就法國對日本在大陸之活動之諒解論之、此種諒解、大半由於法國人心理上之現實的性質、此種性質不許與凡一事體無切近關係之考慮、及空洞之理想麻醉等思想、而置堅硬之事實於不顧、法人因具此種心理故、曾遭不少之詆責、與日本今日所遭相同、然彼曾詆責高調之人、自己享有一種之安全、故出言也易、而法人則未享有安全、今日本處於孤立之地位、根本上亦爲求安全而作戰、其能博法人之同情也宜矣、</p>
<h3>法國空軍夜操</h3>
<p>試演斷定敵機位置新法</p>
<p>▲國民社二十六日巴黎電法國梅兹砲台四周、刻正舉行空軍夜操、今日巴黎晨報載操演詳情、謂此次試演一斷定敵機位置新法、即設一瞭望總站、集合各瞭望所報告、立即標誌於地圖、藉此推見敵機進行路線、作成敵機所向地方臨時保護計劃、對於敵機之高度尤爲注重、俾可通知本國飛機自高進擊、夜操區域内居民悉禁燃燈、火車站亦燈火令息、火車到則障蔽燈光開行</p>
<h3>日議會質問戰</h3>
<p>▲貴院議員斥政府無能</p>
<p>▲電通社二十六日東京電今日貴族院之本會議、於上午十時開會、先由坂本釧之助（同和）緊急質問五一五事件、小山法相答謂、在本議中於適當時期、報告事件之内容云、次乃提出罹災救助資金法中改正案、後由山本内相説明提案之理由、經丸山鶴吉（同和）質問後、交付委員、後由管原重雄（研究）繼續昨日農村問題之再質問、叩詢减輕農村負担之政府意見、更由紀俊秀男（公正）痛駡政府、謂現内閣極不統一、尤其於人事問題、其不統一更完全暴露、又於政策與着眼處、處理非常時局、實可視爲無此能力云、至下午十二時二十分散會、</p>
<h3>匡救案中島大窘藏相</h3>
<p>議塲一片騷然</p>
<p>▲日聯社二十六日東京電衆議院本日下午一時十分開會、本日討論農村救濟問題等重要案、故傍聽席無一空位、議長宣告開會後、政府提交不動産金融及補償損失法案、及昭和七年度一般會計財源之發行公債法案、高橋藏相説明理由武田德三郎登壇質問、謂今次融通資金目的、爲救濟債劵者乎抑救濟銀行家乎、</p>
<p>藏相對此作簡單答辯後、中島彌團繼起登壇、謂匡救時局有無効果、實繫於此案、現在銀行所有之不動産總數爲十四萬萬元、而政府擬融通之資金僅五十萬萬元政府之保證程度二成太少、祇少要三成半、本案之缺點、其作用有救濟有資産階級、而無救濟小資産商工業者、三土鐵相答謂、田中内閣時代之特别融資、與今日之情形不同、中島再起發言、謂融資辦法能否成功、繫於考慮方法之如何、非在此緊急時期提出：：：中島言未完畢、政友議員一齊喧騷、中島毒駡政府與政府會、議塲愈形騷然、中島大聲叱呼、然藏相不答、其次加藤調一登壇質問休業銀行有無融通資格、融資財源之郵政存欵如不增加、政府對此辦法如何、高橋藏相答曰、休業銀行中將來有希望者可以通融、郵政存欵不增加時發行公債、</p>
<h3>僞國承認問題之質問</h3>
<p>▲路透二十六日東京電政友會最活動而有勢力要人森恪民、前曾爲犬養毅内閣之秘書長、昨日對於内田言論提出責問、謂李認「滿洲國」固可贊同、但政府僅考慮法律方面、而不慮及日本此舉之政治關係、及其可能的嚴重後果、政府亦思及如承認「滿洲國」而發生與列强或中國之衝突、日本將何可措置之乎、日本首先發起對「滿洲國」之承認、而不顧及美國或國聯方面之反對、此直發起退歸亞洲之政策、而撤銷六十年來迫隨西方諸國之政策耳云、内田答稱、渠未能披露政府所己採行以防意外的戒備之性質或範圍、但渠深信世界總可諒解日本之行爲云、</p>
<h3>高橋藏相一再露辭意</h3>
<p>國會後或能實現</p>
<p>▲華聯社二十六日東京電日内閣財政部長高橋是清、昨日再對齋藤首相露辭意、原因爲財政策與政友會相差太遠、而且健康不堪重任、據政界所料、高橋辭職於此次國會後或能實現、</p>
<h3>政友會集中攻擊拓相</h3>
<p>▲華聯社二十六日東京電日政友會因黨内久原派及森派反對政府甚力、如處置不得其法、恐因此惹起黨内摇動、遂以彈劾拓相之罷免岸本長官爲題、集中全力攻拓相、迫拓相辭職、造有利於政友會之空氣、遂以永井答詞無誠意、又與首相所答不同爲理由、將提出永井不信任提案、但政府今日在院開臨時閣議、决禮讓相待、豫算總會政友會將採何種對策、甚堪注目、政友會以爲永井辭職、齋藤内閣必因此摇動、而政友會負倒閣之責任、</p>
<h3>秘密報告五一五事件</h3>
<p>▲華聯社二十六日東京電二十五日下院本會議席上、政友會濱田國松究問五一五兇變内容甚急、日政府要求國會開秘密會、由山本内相與小山法相報告經過、定二十七日在上院·二十八日在下院·報告其詳情、</p>
<h3>國同將提議延長會期</h3>
<p>▲華聯社二十六日東京電國民同盟（安逹派）今日派山道襄一往政友會交涉、定明日提出國會期間延長案、但共同提案雖甚困難、政友會不取反對態度、</p>

<p>夾窩亦名騾轎、法以二騾繫置轎之前後、抬之而行故名、轎之容積頗大、尋常行李之外、可容二人坐乘、若祇一人便可偃臥其中、外表看來、似甚舒服、惟驟性甚劣、行時往往雜以跳踪、非老於乘坐者、頗以爲苦、加以轎無一定重心、每易向左右側、騾行雖甚緩、而人身在偃臥時所受之震動、使腹部上下、均異常不適、蓋其震動之方向與情狀、與普通車轎舟輪之震動、各不相同也、此可憎之夾窩、吾人雖不甚歡迎之、然在交通不便之内地、一般人己視爲貴族階級之乘具矣、</p>

<p>夾窩共有二十五輛、夾窩之外、更有驢騾共約十餘四、載負行李、兼之隊前隊後各有武裝同志五十餘人爲之保護、自高處視之、全隊蜿蜒如帶、煞是好看、而余等在夾窩中前後左右波動不己、恍如此身重入摇籃中、此種特殊滋味、非東南人士所能想像也、</p>
<p>▲槍聲響後耀州近</p>
<p>余等於夾窩中緩緩而行、直至下午一時左右、方抵樓底鎭、予性至急、不甘悶坐夾窩中、至是遂改乘綏靖公署張科長之白馬、馬行稍速、且行且看風景、不覺胸襟爲之一暢、不過以啓行稍遲、兼之在途中休息時間稍長、抵覓予鎭時己在四時後、抵馬鞍鎭己五時半左右、是日天陰無烈日、暮色蒼茫、似與夾窩同速率施施而至、七時後天色漸昏暗、余等正急忙行時、左側陡聞槍聲一響、余雖不稍爲動、私念此時若止土匪蠭湧而至我等危矣、兵士等雖未有驚慌之色、聞聲後、向左側警戒、亦頗注意、幸一槍起後、不再續聞、否則全團專家、至少須往匪窟考察一次、不免飽受驚恐、</p>
<p>七時半、光明似將全完全退去、不再與我人以視覺上之便利、所幸者、我人此時己行近耀州、八時涉漆河之水、數十步後、隐約中己見耀洲地方當局等地城外歡迎、入城内、導余等至縣立第一職業學校休息、時亡八時有半、己在完全黑暗中矣</p>
<p>余等在途中、見耀洲附近處、有一線小溪、自高而下、將山中之水灌溉兩旁阡陌、水量既無虞缺乏、農作物遂異常茂盛、向之棉低如小草者、今己欣欣向榮、高約三四尺、開花結實、似十分得意高梁亦甚高　從各方面之田間物看來、此處似帶着幾分江南姿態、不像一般人所想像中之陜西矣、城内似因吾人之來、地上己遍石灰之水、以殺虎菌、而入城之時、邊砲聲轟天而起、以歡迎吾等、吾等爲之忐忑不安、</p>

<p>（五）採煤採煤無一定方法、見煤即採遇水輒止、現因深處有積水三尺、故在上部採煤、　　（六）鑛工井下二十八人、計挖煤八人、拉煤十四人、修路六人、分日夜二班工作、每班十四人工作時間十二小時、地面絞車工人共二十人、每班十人、挖工每班須挖煤一百六七十車、每車裝煤七八十斤、井下工人、自入井至出井共十八日、此十八日中食宿排洩、皆在井中、本地稱爲一大班、每大班共給工價十三元五角、伙食燈油歸工人自備、每人每日計需伙食二角、燈油四兩、合洋一角二分五厘、兩共三角二分五厘、井上工人、每大班共給工資洋十一元、因不需燈油、工資較低、每年採煤時間約六個月、計十大班每出煤一噸、約計工資一元六角、</p>

<p>▲籌欵之建議委員會既履行其調查之職務</p>
<p>對於進行方法則聽工部局之决斷、惟有幾項籌欵之可能、己行之於他國者、則亦不妨提及、如舉行「醫院星期日、」及其他聚會、以便募捐之類、又查前此工部局所派之節儉委員會、其報告（見公報二十二卷第一一七四期）中、曾建議徵收「娱樂捐、」如以此捐專供醫院之用、當易得公衆之贊助、查現今界内影戲院、有二十三所、座位有一八、八00、又較大之中國戲院三所、有座位七一八六、此外若干旅館及他處、向有開映電影者、又跳舞場亦有若干家假定以座價在一元或以上者爲甲類、不及一元者爲乙類、約計之、影戲及劇院、每日最大收入、約共有二五·九0</p>
<p>0元、即每年有一一·0九六·000元、如照座位全數比例、將甲類抽百分之十、乙類抽百分之五、則每年約可得九四0000元、如照實際售出票數、計將甲類抽百分之二十、乙類抽百分之十、則每年約可得一二七0000元、第二法雖收數可以較多但手續複雜、不如採第一法、若再將捐法推行於舉行影戲及娱樂之旅館及跳舞場等、則收數大約可再增四分之一、除去一切意外損失、無論如何、每年總可收捐七十五萬元之譜、照委員會所建議、有此七十五萬之欵、是可敷各事業之經常費、經常費既有把握、則開辦之投資、亦可較易進行籌畫矣、、</p>

<h3>騰騰彈</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>騰騰彈（Ｄumdumbullet）一作逹姆逹姆彈）者。乃國際公約禁用之毒彈也。當淞滬之役。暴日逞其狂燄。甘冒不韙。竟向我軍施用此彈。而無辜民衆蒙其害者。更不可勝計。於此足見暴日之野心與殘忍矣。考此彈之名騰騰者。蓋有由也。英屬印度孟加拉省所屬之一小鎭。名騰騰。與省城加爾谷搭相接近。一七八三年至一八五三年之間。曾以騰騰鎭爲孟加拉砲隊之總兵站。該鎭並有大砲廠及爆彈廠各一所。故有印度胡爾韋區之名。（英國以胡爾韋區爲軍械出産地。印度以騰騰鎭爲之軍械出産地也。）當時因印度有</p>
<p>譁變騷擾之兵。及沿邊之土番。常有猝然侵擊之事。彼輩意氣之狂激。性情之獷悍。愍不畏死。若治以尋常彈丸、不能止其惡氛。故爆彈廠特造槍彈一種。鉛其質而外包以鋼。彈尖之鋼絶薄。若以射擊力極强之來福槍發之。一著人身。其薄而且軟之鋼鼻。即豁然爆裂。而鉛心緊箝肌膚。其所受創傷之痛苦。不可名狀。此乃騰騰彈之正宗也。亦有臨時將尋常之彈改造者。祇須將彈尖以錯刀鑢之。鎳壳裂爲長縫。至鉛心外露爲度。其爆裂之功用。幾與特製者無異。以此種彈丸。而制愍不畏死者之命。原不足惜。而暴日仗其威勢。侵略吾華。大肆慘無人道之毒彈。世界如有公理。不知將何以懲之。昔英人以此彈用於所屬埃及之蘇丹等處。一八九九年。海牙和平會第二次大會時。英軍以英脱之戰在南非洲。亦蒙施用之嫌疑。時人紛起責難。實則英軍當時固未用之也。與會諸國。議定國際條例。戰時不得施放此彈。各國均贊成。獨英美二國非之。然以多數贊成。此例固成立矣。一九0四至0五年俄日之戰。日政府亦以俄軍施放此彈而提出嚴重抗議。今暴日向我如此横行。不知吾政府諸公。作何種態度。然吾知舍簽訂停戰恊定外。其他一切。可母庸計及也。嗚呼。</p>
<h3>鶑花痛語</h3>
<p>— 濟翔</p>
<p>婁東王菘畦。清未耆老。生前學問文章。頗繫一鄉望。垂老作自挽聯云。「生前本乏令名前幸　範尚存。不爲鑽狗洞事。身後有何奢望。但願箕裘勿隨。永無吸鴉片人。」囑其門弟子南通張賽寫而存之。以示後人。時年七十四歲。光緒乙未也。及殁。其子孫鐫之於板。迄今猶懸廳事。奉爲家訓。觀其意殆生平於鴉片最所痛絶。故需不及他。歸於此鄭重言之。如王氏亦可謂拒　一前言矣。</p>
<h3>一篇陳年賬</h3>
<p>— 許厪父</p>
<p>從故紙堆中翻出一本二十五年前求學時代的賬册來。這自然是一種絶無價值的記載。而且小小的書簏。論理。没有它們底地位。乾脆些説。「早該付之一炬的了」。然而當我手裏揑着這本賬册時。未曾檢閲。丨實在也不必檢閲。我心中就發了一種感想。不用説。這種感想。祇是屬於我個人。絶對和任何人不生關係的。但因這等感想的力。竟使我腦筋中充滿了二十年間的回憶。便不禁目視賬册。痴痴地發起怔來。於是我就不知不覺地。把這賬册翻將開來。更不意識地一醮。咦。這益發使我發生了無窮的感想。而且這種感想。竟不止屬於我本人。凡是見到我這賬册的朋友。大概没有不生同樣底感想吧。這不是我小題大做。張皇其詞。列位朋友們。可有子弟們在學校讀書嗎。列位本人。可曾在學校畢業。或現在留學嗎。請把列位所担任的求學經費。彼此參比一下。包你會得自然而然地。很留神的往下看去。也許還有精細的朋友。這得拿起算盤子兒。三五一十五四四一十六的。替我結算一下咧。</p>
<p>賬册第一頁。就是繳付學校的欵目。上開、一、繳付學校本學期膳宿費大洋念五元。學費五元。書籍費五元。（那時候一學期。是六個月。但各費均照五個月計算。因須除去年暑假也。）制服操衣等費共五元。（這一次。只少可用三四學期。每學期只派着一元多些。）以上共計大洋四十元。這一天。大概還没有開學。所以後面還連寫着幾筆零星賬目。一是和兩位同學出街。買了一雙緞鞋。價洋一元。一頂緞帽。價目洋四角。吃了五個肉包子。每個三文。一共四十五文。這十一頁賬。就寫完了。以下每日開支。也照抄五天。第一天。付包子十二文。付洗長衫一件二十文。共三十二文。第二天。付燒餅八文。付洗短衫褲二十文。共三十文。第三天。付肉餃九文。付洗襪子十文。付修面十六文。共三十五文。第四天。付包子十二文。付强盜牌香烟。（這是私賬。在學校内是禁止的。）七十二文。（按那時中下社會頂流行的。便是這一種烟。每包十支、錢三十六文。）共八十四文。第五天、付燒餅二十文。（按那時的燒餅。每枚三文。比現在的蟹壳黃稍大。這天大約是輪到我作東。否則我無論如何。吃不到十枚之多。）付洗衣二十文。共五十文。</p>
<p>看到這等賬目。眞使我回想到那時讀書　負担（其實不但讀書一實在可算輕而　　　但是我還記得我們的父兄　　己經愁眉嘆氣地説。「如今的讀書。眞不容易。比到我們小時候。相差不止十倍了。」我。竟捨不得把這本「陳年賬簿」毁棄了。拍拍灰塵。理理縐紋。趕緊藏到箱子裏去。</p>
<h3>王慶勳之口琴</h3>
<p>— 舞霜</p>
<p>音樂之道。與政通也。古人以禮樂教人。誠以音樂感人最深。陶冶性情。厥功滋偉也。嘅自雅樂淪亡。鄭聲競作。下里巴人之曲。靡靡亡國之音。舉世滔滔。此世風之所以日下也。近年以還。歐西音樂。流入中土。黌舍弦歌之地。胥唱米米沙沙之調。舞榭電影之院。競奏爵士圓舞之曲。急管繁弦。陶醉人心。若鋼琴·風琴·繁華令。匪不盛行於一時也。然欲稱以「民衆音樂」。則唯口琴尚矣。口琴Ｈarmonic或Ｍouthorgan初行於德國繼行於美法諸邦。今則日本亦極風行（川章口吾·最爲著名·）誠以口琴之爲物。猶如美人之嬌小玲瓏。洵爲携帶最便之伴侣。矧夫身價低廉。母須十斛以量珠。故雅合民衆之音樂也。若夫花前月下。登山臨水。或偕素心人鼓枻中流。或與二三知己酒餘茶後。口琴一曲。其樂不啻檀板紅牙淺唱低斟時也。或謂口琴者。兒童一翫具也。烏得與鋼琴提琴相並論。不知鋼琴提琴可奏之「複音·」「琶首·」「震音·」「顫音·」「八度和音·」「裝飾音」「高低半音。」口琴無不能之。故自王慶勳氏提倡以來。口琴遂風行於一時矣。王君·台灣人。酷嗜音樂。於口琴尤擅特長。提倡傅授。不遺餘力。乃組織口琴隊於大夏大學。既而又推及於無錫·南京·鎭江·蘇州·杭州等處。所至靡不受熱烈之歡迎。其在各地演奏也。如怨如慕。如泣如訴。如飄風急雨之驟至。如急筦繁弦之競奏。若所奏小夜曲·浮士德·麗娃栗妲·茶花女·巴城女郎·長想思·雙鷹進行曲·晚夏薔薇等等。或收入話匣。或加入播音。而天一電影公司且收入有聲電影之中。王君之技。概可見焉。豐子愷先生序君所編口琴吹奏法曰。「藝術之國中。」有文學·美術·音樂諸宫殿。世人競往游焉。文學美術之宫。其第一重門皆公開。人人可得而入。唯音樂之宫。門禁最嚴。非持有入塲劵者。不得踐其庭徑也。：：：王君慶勳。其門之賣票人也。」實則中華口琴之宫殿。王君乃爲之基礎。豈僅爲賣門票之人而己哉。</p>
<h3>十二一條秘史（五）</h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>日置益呆若石像似的坐着聽我發表意見。並不反駁。我講了半小時的話。日置益並不否認二十一條事件。他想我去的意思。不是單爲中國。也不是單爲美國。實爲維持三國的初平。他謝訪他的盛意。</p>
<p>臨别。他很不自然的對我説。「我怕日本跟了德國的政策跑得太遠了。但是我又何能爲力呢我必須服從政府的命令的。」我説「你應當自作主張假使我要代表我的政府。而政府所走的路。我以爲是錯誤的。對於政府很危險的。我當以去就力争。」我言畢就走。</p>
<p>未幾。我去見芮恩士。知道他己同喬爾敦會見過了。喬爾敦對於日本此舉。覺得十分懊喪。覺得英國一世紀來在遠東所力争得着的利益快要喪失了。他的意思是因爲英國正在同德國作生死的挣扎。希望美國拯救中國。芮恩士呌我寫封信給美國聯合新聞的史東。</p>
<p>我同芮恩士晤談之後。就寫一封四頁長的信給威爾遜總統。説明爲何美國應爲二十一條向日抗議。我另寫一函給國務卿曰萊安。把二十一條的内容和道德上政治上商業上美國政府應當提出嚴重抗議的理由。源源本本的説出。我一面主張美國不應有對日宣戰的威脅。因爲美國不能調兵到五千英里外去遠征日本。美國祇能宣告日本假使日本堅持其二十一條要求。美國祇有到了歐戰結束之後。將此事件提交海牙法庭。美國將聯合世界各國力促日本歸還中國主權。日本也没有能力跨過五千英里的海洋攻打美國。所以美國也不必怕日本對美宣戰。</p>
<p>還幾封信發出之後。我便往訪袁世凱的顧問馬立遜。一兩天之後。我又訪蔡廷幹。詳述經過。蔡廷幹對我很感謝。並代表袁世凱呌我趕往美國遊説。以二萬元爲開頭的費用。到美後再絡續匯寄。我表示不能接受中國政府分文。只答允以教會代表的私人資格赴美訪威爾遜和白萊安。一九一五年三月二十三日我遂出京。到上海就乘船赴美。</p>

<h3>天津花紗狀况沉静</h3>
<p>津訊（二十五日）西河花市况沉静、昨棉業抗加牙税風潮、尚無結果、所有運赴華界各地、紗廠交易、均告停頓、在租界中存貨者、略可通融成交、亦無巨欵、勢似滑旋、清喜行買進二百八十四包、開價二十五兩八錢、又棉紗市情仍趨滯嘉、氣象和平、高陽帮買三十二支彩球紗、價一百六十七兩云、</p>
<h3>糧食米價跌落一二角</h3>
<p>▲滬南昨日各帮來源二十餘號、浦存略有、城鄉店胃不佳、常錫北粳與蘇同帮各跌一二角、新粳新客尖被風所阻、到頭有限、開盤定局、早晚稻到銷二平、價無升沉、</p>

<h3>標粉市良好</h3>
<p>昨粉市上下午開盤後各月份大致呈堅定之象以洋麥報價回漲五六角左右業外人心一致看高、本月份因行家將交割、各廠之棧單、聞少交割、本街現銷尚覺活動、遠期各月份、以北路客帮、逐盤均有少買進、福阜兩廠、出數甚少致市氣良好逐步提高、觀後步當暫盤旋也、結果本月份較前日大一分、九月份大一分半、十月份大二分半、十一月份大二分十二月份大二分半、一月份大二分云、</p>
<h3>期麥呈近疲遠稳</h3>
<p>昨期麥上下午開盤後、各月份呈近疲遠稳之象、本月份因交割之故本市有現貨之行家、陸續套出、而收貨者、除己準備外、餘尚無甚把握、致人心甚寂、開價反呈不振遠期各月份、初因洋麥之報漲、人心帶高、後爲本月份趨疲、買氣有限稍見回跌、結果本月份較前日跌四分、九月份至十一月份大一分、十二月份大三分、現麥市面、做開未暢、祇紹興麥開三兩三錢七分次至三錢二分、計一千三百包云、</p>

<h3>五金薄白鐵銷滯價疲</h3>
<p>薄白鐵近幾日趨勢又不振、蓋客　均無採辦、而用户又少收進、是以市情寂寞、故標凖由挺而稳、由稳而疲、最近交易寥寥、市象更見冷落、行情暗鬆、計三尺七尺紅島牌每張估九錢八分比前跌落二分、雜牌九錢五分、比前跌二分半、三六尺紅島牌亦由八錢五分降至八錢二分、雜牌八錢、連日市上開出除内河長江兩路微有點綴外、别帮殊少指染者云、</p>

<h3>古董佛</h3>
<p>磁銅玉石書畫，及緞皮藥品等類，這種古裏古董，希奇古怪的東西，的確是我國古來文化的結晶，確有保存的價值，尤其是故宫博物院儲藏的東西，都是希世奇珍，天然更有保藏的必，</p>
<p>但這種東西，到底是一種貴族化的玩物，即如前清時，做了大官，一定要買幾件古色古香的東西，陳列陳列、表示風雅，就是民國時，此種風氣，亦未全攺，譬如一家人家，有田有地，有産業，有餘錢，方才想到去購買幾件古董來玩玩，倘然吃了早晨無夜頓，開門七件事，尚無辦法，那裏還説得到去儲藏古董呢</p>
<p>「祖産不變賣」，原是有志氣子弟的話，試觀我國的國家，若云土地，一部不能保，若云主權，一部分不能保，國帑如洗，羅雀俱窮，那裏還談得到保存國粹呢，索性將故宫古物完全變賣，興辦實業，或發展教育，廢物利用，到是一舉兩得的事呢</p>
<p>「漫藏誨盜」原是歷試不爽的名言，古宫博物院，前日被人控告盜賣古物，到現在爲止，雖尚未明白其中的事態，但是「事出有因、查無實據」的公文妙語，我國公文中早己用得朽爛，現在且不必去加以追求，就是保管費一項而論，每年亦不知費了多少，索性斬了葛藤，完全變賣，免得人家注意呢</p>

<h3>水産品製膠概説曼倩</h3>
<p>膠是由動物的皮骨製造成功的，不過普通原料方面，都是利用陸上動物，誰又知道，水産動物中的鱗，鰾，皮，骨等，出都能採製的呢，現在就我所知道的，介紹給本刋的讀者：</p>
<p>用途膠的用途極廣，工業界中直接簡接在在需要着牠，像火柴，砂皮，造紙，釀酒，漆工，印刷，木業，醫藥，照相，製版，裱裝，染色，製革，機織，物體的接合，製造標本，澄清的可作食料等，那不過是最著名的吧了！</p>
<p>組成原素炭素49%窒素183·%水素6·6%酸素和硫黃26·1%至於關於膠的分子式，至今還没有確定，有Ci62Hi12iN3rO39C76Hi124O39</p>
<p>Ci2HioN2O4C35H37N3iO3等幾種，不知究屬誰是？</p>
<p>原料凡是含有CoLLagen質的東西，都能夠拿來製膠。像海驢，駮類，鱈的皮，鯨，海豚的海獸骨，駮和鱈的魚骨，龜甲類的壳：鰊和鰛的麟：鮸魚，鯉魚，鱈魚，黃魚，黃花魚的魚鰾：駮和鰤的胃膜，抺香鯨的膠質膜等，都是很適宜而重要的原料！</p>
<p>種類用水産品製造者可以分皮膠，骨膠，鱗膠，鰾膠，水膠等幾種，　　製膠法概論（一）脂肪的抽出：這手續也有三個方法：A，用有蒸氣蛇管的蜜閉釜加熱溶出：B，浸漬器内加壓溶出：C，用揮發性的溶劑抽出，像Benz</p>
<p>en和四鹽化炭素。這三種方法。A能夠得脂肪5%B可得7%to8%C則全部都能抽出，當然的現在是最適用的了丨　　（二）膠分的溶解：這也可分眞火加熱法，直接蒸氣加熱法，間接蒸氣加熱法，隔水加熱法四種。其中以隔水加熱法是最適用：因爲牠不予以過度的熱力，能夠使品質不致受着損害，而得到優良的製品！</p>
<p>製造法分論（一）皮膠：牠製造時候的順序是脱毛（廢棄的皮屑不必），膠原料的煑沸，膠液的清浄，凝固，乾燥。　　（二）骨膠製造的手續有下列八項：A骨的破碎：B脂肪的抽出：C浸酸：D膠的抽出：E膠液的澄清和漂白：F膠液的濃縮：G凝固：H乾燥。</p>
<p>（三）鱗膠鱗膠的製法和骨膠的製法相同，不過牠到第三步浸酸，程度常較骨膠製造時弱，所以祇要用少量的鹽酸好了丨牠的凝固力也比較的弱，所以煑沸的時期和温度，也應當注意的！</p>
<p>（四）鰾膠製造之先，須用清水使牠浸漬柔軟，然後方可以着手抽出：至於其他的手續，完全的皮膠的製法相同。</p>
<p>（五）水膠以上所説的各種都是固形膠類，其於鱗膠皮膠的膠液中，加入大概５％石炭酸酒精溶液，使牠凝固力薄弱，就得到一種液狀膠類，就是所謂水膠。</p>
<p>以上所説，都不過是一點極简略的情形，實在因爲限於篇幅的緣故，再不容我多説了！若有問題的話，留待下次再討論吧！</p>

<h3>對改良墳墓的討論張同</h3>
<p>先允宗先生在貴刋上發表「改良墳墓」問題，他所説要改良墳墓的原因，果然是針針見血，但是他所説怎樣改良的方法，我却不能表充分的同意，</p>
<p>我們所以要改良墳墓意思，就是要縮小消費，增加生産，現在朱允宗先生所提出的改良辦法第二條中説：「由官廳劃定區域設立公墓下令呌民家把棺材葬在一「處」試問官廳劃定的區域：難道不是田地嗎？人民的棺材，難道不是金錢嗎？照這樣看來，朱允宗先生的辦法，恐怕還不是很經濟的手腕吧，</p>
<p>我以爲要求最經濟的辦法，祇有取消「墳墓」這個名稱「因爲有了墳墓，任你怎麽的縮小範圍，總要佔一些地盤，消費一點金錢的。</p>
<p>要求不佔一些地盤，節省一點金錢，那祇有「火葬」因爲火葬有（一）免了出錢去買棺材（二）不費一些地盤去做墳墓（三）用不著再費時候到墳墓上去的好處，</p>
<p>火葬辦法（一）由官廳設一公共焚化處，下令呌百姓將屍身到該處去焚化（二）焚化後屍灰由百姓自由處置（三）如有仍用墳墓制度者，由官廳隨時將墳墓掘撥，更需罰金。</p>
<p>這樣的辦法，對於「時間」「金錢」「土地」多可以節省，並且「土地」「金錢」兩項，簡直可以不用耗費，較諸「公墓判度」不是更好嗎。（却酬）</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>臨别那一夜龍玉</h3>
<p>在臨别那一夜，校園裏一切覺得異常的可愛，以前一天到晚罵着所謂修道院圍牆，這一晚竟把它看得像皇宫一般，素來厭憎的隔隣牛皮廠排過來臭味，也好像含着一種不可思議的意味，在這留戀不捨中，宿舍的房子却仍鐵面無私地巍立着，每一間房間，都是堆得七零八落，誰也想不到這在三日前，還稱爲模範宿舍。</p>
<p>房間的主人們，爲不許跑房間規則所限，只得都出來廓内談天，有些坐在房門口，有些立着，還有些竟坐在地板上。</p>
<p>「喂！神氣啊，文憑到手了，可是不要忘記了我們。」</p>
<p>平説「大學園雖消遥，我倒是喜歡在這修道院内：：：</p>
<p>叮噹，呵噹</p>
<p>甚麽第二次鈴，我這錶九時半還缺十分，芯漲紅了面從地下勃然跳起來。　　不要吵啊，我們己談了好多時候，當然己到時候，我們去睡吧，素守校規的芳，很正經地説，好了，你也好快些去睡，不然又要起不起來。</p>
<p>數分鐘後，那充滿了生命的宿舍，却寂寞得像死一般。</p>
<p>忽然一陣大聲，把那寂寞打破了，「快起來啊，你們！阿灰去看電影了，要十二時方回家，芝蔴香蕉，也到外面却了：：：：」</p>
<p>芯這樣地喊着，一時樓上樓下一個個都從房裏跳出來，唱歌的唱歌，呌人的呌人，這種嘈雜的聲音，在校裏可説破天荒的一次。</p>
<p>誰説阿灰不住？</p>
<p>趙媽説的，她房間電燈雖亮着，却是空城計。</p>
<p>「阿灰上南京看電影麽？最好她路上遇着些甚麽：：：」</p>
<p>「不要黑良心，」</p>
<p>「看！在草地上不是大頭菜及大鼻麽？</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「營她們！她們又不是我們舍監，」</p>
<p>正在高興時，不曉得誰喊了一聲，阿灰來了，這一喊每一個都像觸電一般向房内便跑，得！小皮鞋脚聲，阿灰果然來了，阿灰脚步總是過小，而且又未有學生們那般跑的訓練，所以她到時，宿舍己是鴉雀無聲，總算運氣，没有人給她捉着，不然又是五個過失圈。</p>
<p>據説阿灰並不是去看電影，不過到外國先生處吃夜飯，那天晚上她連來查了三次房間，最末一次，是穿了粉紅的睡衣，同學們説，在月亮下看了有些怕。</p>

<h3>Northeast Problem and Sino-Russian-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Since the occurrence of the Northeast Incident, both Chinese citizens and people in Europe and America have paid close attention to the relationship between Russia and Japan. Russia, on the one hand, has increased its troop deployments in the Far East for defense, and on the other hand, its newspapers have repeatedly condemned Japan. The situation between the two countries has been tense at times, and relaxed at others, making it difficult to discern the true state of affairs. Recently, rumors of the Japanese military's covetousness towards Jehol, suggesting a tense situation between Russia and Japan, have been rife. However, the situation has recently become more relaxed. Although there are varying speculations about the actual state of relations between the two countries, a general overview can be provided as follows based on the facts:</p>
<p>Russia's ideology and position differ from those of European and American countries, placing it in a relatively isolated position in the international arena. Recently, it has been focused on internal development, carrying out its Five-Year Plan, hoping to complete its mission through its own efforts. If war breaks out, not only will the development work be unable to proceed according to plan, but also, due to its isolation, it may invite other enemies, posing a significant risk. Therefore, it is unlikely that Russia intends to engage in immediate warfare with Japan. Regardless of other factors, its lack of willingness to fight can be seen from the three most obvious facts. First, since last autumn until recently, Russia, indignant at the brutality of the Japanese, has repeatedly expressed its eagerness to see the restoration of US-Russian relations become a reality. Its intention seems to be that without assistance from the United States, it cannot take any active action against Japan. Second, in January of this year, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa of Japan, on his way back to Japan from France, passed through the Russian capital. Russian authorities expressed their intention to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the two countries. Although the Japanese side did not accept it, recently, when the League of Nations investigation team went to Northeast China to investigate, the Russian side did not cooperate with the investigation team. Even if it was not pro-Japanese, it revealed its neutral attitude. Third, the North Sea fishing rights issue, which has been unresolved for a long time and could lead to conflict between the two countries, has recently been resolved through mutual concessions. According to Washington dispatches, Japan and Russia have agreed on several important conditions, indicating a new understanding between the two countries. (The conditions were detailed in yesterday's newspaper and will not be repeated.) It is clear that Russia has no immediate desire to go to war with Japan. From the Japanese perspective, Japan's most urgent goal at present is to annex Northeast China. To prevent interference from other countries, all its efforts are concentrated on this point, and it is unwilling to relax in the slightest. As for going to war with Russia, that is not its current priority. Recently, loyal and brave volunteer armies in Northeast China, taking advantage of the natural cover of the green cornfields, have been actively conducting operations, repeatedly achieving victories and inflicting blows on the enemy. The Japanese army is exhausted from rushing around. The troops advancing to Jehol have already stalled. Given this situation, even if they wanted to provoke a conflict with Russia, it is practically impossible. If Russia were to intervene militarily in Japan's aggression against China, Japan might be forced into a risky battle. However, Russia has no such intention and maintains a neutral attitude. Japan is happy to use all its strength to deal with Northeast China. Why would it unnecessarily provoke a conflict with Russia? Moreover, Japan's seemingly ferocious attitude towards Russia is merely a smokescreen tactic. Because its aggression against China is excessive, it has no choice but to put on a false show of strength towards Russia, using the pretext of preventing communism to cover up its crimes of disregarding treaties and breaking faith, and to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment in Europe and America.</p>
<p>Observing entirely from an objective standpoint, this kind of relationship between Russia and Japan is actually beneficial to both countries. A temporary compromise between Russia and Japan means that Japan does not have to worry about Russia's intervention in its invasion of Northeast China, and it can focus all its efforts on dealing with the League of Nations and the United States. This is Japan's advantage. According to a Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 19th, "The US National Bank has negotiated with the Soviet government to lend 40 million yuan to the Soviet Union. German industrialists are quite panicked by this news, because although the amount of the loan is not very large, it will enable the United States to recognize the Soviet Union and perhaps implicitly recognize the cancellation of Russia's pre-war debts..." From this, it can be seen that if relations between Russia and Japan were to break down early, the United States might instead sit back and watch the outcome. Now, although Russia is actively preparing to prevent any eventuality, it is simultaneously keeping its troops still and frequently sending flirtatious signals to Japan, which makes the United States uneasy and forces it to consider changing its traditional policy towards Russia. Russian diplomacy is extremely skillful, and one cannot help but be amazed.</p>
<p>The situation in Northeast China is deteriorating, and the relationship between Russia and Japan has gone from tense to relaxed. We must ask ourselves how we should deal with this. Based on past facts, this question is not difficult to answer. Why do we say that? The failure of the past lies entirely in the Chinese people's hope that the tensions between Russia and Japan or between Japan and the United States would reduce Japan's pressure on China, while lacking active efforts to fight back and recover lost territory. If China had resisted from the beginning, not only would the relationship between Russia and Japan not be like this, but the international situation would also be very different from what it is today. During the Battle of Shanghai, when the 19th Route Army resisted, the League of Nations supported our claim to justice, the United States expressed its non-recognition of Japan's military actions that disregarded treaties, and Soviet newspapers also condemned Japan's tyranny. At that time, the international atmosphere did indeed change. Therefore, if we want to shift the world's attention from the silent state of the Northeast problem, it actually depends entirely on our own efforts and not on relying on others. According to news from the capital, the "Central Executive Committee recently discussed Japan's policy. After detailed discussions by various committees, the result was that, on the one hand, Northeast China's armies were ordered to prepare to cross the border and recover lost territory, and a serious warning was once again issued to Japan. On the other hand, a report was still submitted to the League of Nations, requesting it to uphold justice and stop Japan's aggression." We secretly hope that the central government will not prioritize the latter over the former. Only when both are given equal importance can the international situation be changed. As for the former, the people should also urge the central government to carefully plan, provide the Northeast China's armies with substantial assistance, and set a strict deadline for them to comply with the order to cross the border and advance separately, without being allowed to make excuses or delay. Only then can the international atmosphere be changed in a short period of time, and Japan's ambition to invade Northeast China may be slightly restrained.</p>

There is absolutely no possibility of conflict. It must be that two companies of infantry from Jiang Peiqiong's brigade mutinied in January, only 90 li from Guiyang. Wang Jialie sent personnel to disarm them, resulting in minor contact, which led to this misunderstanding. Jiang Peiqiong has taken the blame and resigned, and Wang Jialie has sent him out of the province to inspect military affairs. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US and British Attitudes Temporarily Remain Silent on Uchida's Diplomatic Speech</h3>
<p>Right of Self-Defense Actually Extends Beyond National Territory</p>
<p>Japan Ultimately Violates the Nine-Power Treaty Despite Sophistry</p>
<p>The United States Does Not Wish to Take Further Action Before the Investigation Report Is Made Public</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency Washington, 25th - Today, the U.S. State Department believes that yesterday's speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida in the Tokyo Parliament was intended directly for the League of Nations as a statement by Japan on the status of Manchuria. Therefore, the United States does not intend to respond. Observers in official circles believe that if Japan recognizes the "Manchu Puppet State," even with Uchida's defense, it would clearly seem to violate the Nine-Power Treaty. However, they also stated that, from a legal perspective, whether this action violates the treaty will depend on whether the "Manchu State" can be considered a truly independent country or a Japanese puppet. It is expected that the League of Nations investigation report will clarify this point. The State Department spokesperson recently stated that Count Uchida clearly intended to broadly explain Japan's position to the League of Nations and the world. When the Japanese Embassy sent a copy of the speech to the State Department on the same day, the State Department immediately explained this view to the person. When reporters later asked a high-ranking official about Count Uchida's claim that Japan's right of self-defense under the Kellogg-Briand Pact now extends beyond its national territory to Manchuria, they were told that there are no regulations on this point in international law. According to the final statement from the State Department, the United States may not take further action regarding the Far East until the League of Nations investigation team submits its report.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 26th - According to a well-informed reporter from the New York Tribune, the United States will use its influence to maintain diplomatic ostracism to deal with Japan's decision to recognize the "Manchu Puppet State." The reporter meant that other countries would likely do the same. Washington officials view Count Uchida's speech as being directed at the League of Nations, while their eyes are focused on the Lytton Commission report. The authorities have now stated that Japan's recognition of the "Manchu Puppet State" will be regarded as a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the government has confirmed that President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson do not wish to issue a response to Uchida's speech. They also do not wish to issue any statement regarding the "Manchu Puppet State" before the League of Nations takes action on the Lytton Commission report. The New York Times today published an editorial stating that Count Uchida's reasons for Japan's actions in the Three Eastern Provinces are the same as Germany's explanation in 1914 for its invasion of Belgium and France. Uchida anticipates that the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact may be invoked by various countries against Japan, and that the Lytton Commission's report may also be unfavorable to Japan. Therefore, he issued this speech as a preemptive measure, which is tantamount to a direct and severe challenge to the authority of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Continuing Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 26th - A certain high-ranking British official stated today during a visit by a Reuters reporter that Great Britain views the entire Far East case as being under consideration. As a member of the League of Nations, Britain is now one of the referees. The official cannot express an opinion on Japan's recognition of the "Manchu State" or confirm the general conclusion of this move until he receives the Lytton Commission report. He expects that the report will not be available for international study until the end of September. Opinions differ in London on whether Japan's recognition of the "Manchu State" violates the Nine-Power Treaty. Some say that if the "Manchu State" is one day recognized by the public as a de facto government, then the Western powers will likely follow suit. If so, invoking the Nine-Power Treaty will clearly be impossible. Others say that Japan's recognition of the "Manchu State" is indeed a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. If Japan does this, the signatory countries of the treaty should convene a meeting to decide what steps should be taken to deal with the violator.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Mock Japan's Unilateral Interpretation</h3>
<p>Saying Japan Wants to Recognize a Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Clearly Resisting the Moral Consciousness of the World</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 26th - The Conservative newspapers here do not criticize Uchida's speech in Parliament last night. However, the Liberal and Labour newspapers point out that the speech foreshadows dangerous possibilities. The Liberal Westminster Gazette says that conflict may arise again in the Far East. Japan's troop increase in Shanghai is a frightening reason. It is unwise and ill-considered for Uchida to make these remarks before the Lytton report is released. Japan cannot expect other countries to accept its one-sided argument that its actions in the Eastern Provinces do not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other treaties. The Labour Party's Daily Herald editorial, titled "Japan's Puppet," says that the Far East is now playing a farce, but this drama contains the possibility of world tragedy. Japan's recognition of the "Manchu Puppet State" is the most recent step in a deliberate resistance to the moral consciousness of the world and will cause the clouds of war to fill the sky. The Manchester Guardian's editorial, titled "Is Manchuria a Country of Manchus?" said that as far as Japan is concerned, Japan's recognition of the "Manchu State" is a direct and deliberate contempt for the Lytton Commission's recommendations. This move will cause other countries in the League of Nations to repeatedly and permanently recognize that the situation in the Three Eastern Provinces was created in a manner that is largely inconsistent with Japan's national obligations. According to the non-recognition doctrine sung by US Secretary of State Stimson, the powers will refuse to engage with the "Manchu State" under any circumstances. ▲Kokumin News Agency, London, 26th - The Daily Chronicle states that the Far East situation is currently full of dangerous possibilities. The League of Nations should no longer hesitate. Japan must be notified that this kind of contempt for world conscience and garrulous defense is intolerable to the world.</p>
<h3>World-Renowned Scholar Discusses Future International Political Situation</h3>
<p>US-Japan War Will Lead to All-European Hegemony War</p>
<p>Result Will Establish a US-Dominated Situation</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Massachusetts United Telegram -</p>
<p>On the 17th, the Political Science Association of Massachusetts held a summer lecture. Mr. Arnold Toynbee, Director of the British International Affairs Research Institute and world-renowned scholar, expressed his views on the future international political situation as follows: "If we look at the current US isolationist policy in the international arena, the result will inevitably lead to a US-Japan war. After the US-Japan war, an all-European hegemony war will be triggered. As a result, the United States may seize world hegemony. Because the US foreign policy is currently alienated from various countries around the world, and the United States directly clashes with Japan in the Pacific, it is not difficult to imagine. Once the US and Japan go to war, countries along the Pacific coast such as China, Russia, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will inevitably unite as US allies and join the war. At this time, Japan will inevitably be defeated. However, although the United States defeats Japan, it will also inevitably suffer damage. The countries that join this war, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, will have a significant impact on Britain, leading to the collapse of the British Empire. The United States, having defeated its enemy in the Pacific, will cause all countries in Europe to feel threatened and have to unite to defend against the United States. At this time, a worldwide war may break out. The United States, with its strong military power, will eventually achieve final victory and establish a world peace order under US domination."</p>
<h3>The East News' View of the Franco-Japanese Understanding</h3>
<p>▲World Press says: The semi-official English-language "Japan Times and Mail" yesterday published an editorial entitled "Franco-Japanese Relations", which implicitly admits that there is an understanding between France and Japan regarding Japan's China policy. The translation is published below for our citizens to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Japan has recently been so busy with its relations with Manchuria and China that it has no time to pay attention to its relations with the rest of the world, while other countries are taking advantage of the turmoil in Asia to pay close attention to Japan, either through the League of Nations or through notes and inquiries. In the future, when the situation in the Far East is settled, Japan may take the time to create a clear list to show its relationship with the powers.</p>
<p>In this list, Japan's feelings towards France will undoubtedly increase in warmth and friendship, because France's wise attitude of taking a bystander's stance on the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, while some other countries have adopted an interventionist policy, is a prominent and welcome thing.</p>
<p>The Franco-Japanese Indochina Agreement of August 26 has come into effect, and the friendship between the two countries will be further enhanced. This agreement, which has been pending for thirty years, was finally signed on May 3, which is truly a happy event. Negotiations began in 1924 and could have been resolved earlier. The reason for the long delay was partly due to the opposition of French capitalists who reside in Paris and have invested heavily in Vietnam, fearing that after the agreement was concluded, the import of Japanese goods would invade their privileges. This is a reasonable concern, so the agreement contains remedial provisions that, while allowing for the expansion of existing trade, also protect the export of French goods to Vietnam (excerpt). Now let us return to the discussion of France's understanding of Japan's activities on the mainland. This understanding is largely due to the realistic nature of the French mentality, which does not allow considerations that are not closely related to a matter, and thoughts such as empty ideals to paralyze it, and disregards hard facts. The French have been criticized a lot for having this mentality, the same as Japan is experiencing today. However, those who criticized the high-profile people enjoyed a kind of security themselves, so it was easy to speak, while the French did not enjoy security. Today, Japan is in an isolated position and is fundamentally fighting for security. It is appropriate for it to win the sympathy of the French.</p>
<h3>French Air Force Night Exercises</h3>
<p>Testing a New Method for Determining the Location of Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>▲Kokumin News Agency, Paris, 26th - Air force night exercises are currently being held around the Metz fortress in France. The Paris Morning Post today published details of the exercises, saying that this trial is a new method for determining the location of enemy aircraft. It sets up a general observation station, gathers reports from various observation posts, and immediately marks them on a map, thereby inferring the enemy aircraft's route and creating a temporary protection plan for the area the enemy aircraft is heading towards. Particular attention is paid to the altitude of the enemy aircraft, so that domestic aircraft can be notified to attack from above. Residents in the night exercise area are prohibited from lighting lamps, and the lights at the train station are also turned off. When a train arrives, the lights are shielded before it departs.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Questioning War</h3>
<p>▲Members of the Upper House Reprimand the Government for Incompetence</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Today's plenary session of the House of Peers opened at 10:00 am. First, Kuranosuke Sakamoto (Dowa) urgently questioned the May 15 Incident. Justice Minister Oyama replied that he would report on the details of the incident at an appropriate time during the session. Next, the bill to amend the Disaster Relief Fund Act was presented, followed by an explanation of the reasons for the proposal by Home Minister Yamamoto. After questioning by Tsurukichi Maruyama (Dowa), it was referred to a committee. Then, Shigeo Sugawara (Research) continued yesterday's re-questioning on the rural problem, asking the government's opinion on reducing the burden on rural areas. Furthermore, Hidetoshi Ki (Justice) strongly scolded the government, saying that the current cabinet is extremely uncoordinated, especially on personnel issues, and its lack of coordination is completely exposed. Also, in terms of policy and perspective, it can be regarded as incapable of handling the extraordinary situation. The meeting adjourned at 12:20 pm.</p>
<h3>Large Embarrassment for Minister of Finance Nakajima in Relief Plan</h3>
<p>The Assembly Hall Was in an Uproar</p>
<p>▲Japan United Press, Tokyo, 26th - The House of Representatives opened at 1:10 pm today. Today, important issues such as the rural relief problem were discussed, so every seat in the gallery was occupied. After the speaker announced the opening of the meeting, the government submitted the Real Estate Finance and Compensation for Losses Bill, and the Government Bond Issuance Bill for the General Account of the Showa 7th Fiscal Year. Minister of Finance Takahashi explained the reasons. Tokusaburo Takeda took the stage to question, saying, "Is the purpose of this financing fund to rescue bondholders or to rescue bankers?"</p>
<p>After the Minister of Finance gave a simple answer to this, Yata Nakajima took the stage, saying that the effectiveness of the relief situation actually depends on this case. The total number of real estate owned by banks now is 140,000,000 yuan, but the government plans to finance only 50,000,000 yuan. The government's guarantee level of 20% is too low, it should be at least 35%. The shortcomings of this case are that its effect is to rescue the bourgeois class, but not to rescue small property owners, merchants, and industrialists. Minister of Railways Tsuchiya replied that the special financing during the Tanaka cabinet was different from the situation today. Nakajima spoke again, saying that whether the financing method can succeed depends on how the method is considered, not on the timing when this urgent period is proposed::: Before Nakajima finished speaking, Seiyukai members all made a fuss, and Nakajima angrily scolded the government and the government meeting, and the parliament hall became even more turbulent. Nakajima yelled loudly, but the Minister of Finance did not answer. Next, Choichi Kato took the stage to question whether bankrupt banks were eligible for financing. If postal savings funds are not increased, how will the government handle this method? Minister of Finance Takahashi replied that bankrupt banks that have future prospects can be financed, and government bonds will be issued if postal savings funds are not increased.</p>
<h3>Questioning on the Issue of Recognizing the Puppet State</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 26th - Kakumin Mori, a key figure in the Seiyukai, who was formerly Secretary-General of the Inukai cabinet, questioned Uchida yesterday, saying that he could agree to recognizing the "Manchu State," but the government only considered the legal aspects and did not consider the political relationship of Japan's actions, and their possible serious consequences. Did the government also consider what measures Japan would take if recognizing the "Manchu State" would cause conflict with the powers or China? Japan first initiated the recognition of the "Manchu State" without regard to the opposition of the United States or the League of Nations, which is a direct initiation of the policy of returning to Asia and revoking the policy of following Western countries for sixty years, he said. Uchida replied that he could not disclose the nature or scope of the precautionary measures that the government had already taken to prevent accidents, but he firmly believed that the world would generally understand Japan's actions.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Takahashi Repeatedly Expressed His Intention to Resign</h3>
<p>May Be Realized After the Diet Session</p>
<p>▲China United Press, Tokyo, 26th - Japanese Cabinet Minister of Finance Takahashi Korekiyo again expressed his intention to resign to Prime Minister Saito yesterday. The reason is that the financial policy is too different from the Seiyukai, and his health cannot bear the heavy burden. According to political circles, Takahashi's resignation may be realized after this Diet session.</p>
<h3>Political Friends Association Concentrates Attacks on Colonial Minister</h3>
<p>▲From Tokyo on the 26th by the China United News Agency: Due to strong opposition from the Kuwabara and Mori factions within the Political Friends Association against the government, fearing internal upheaval if not handled properly, the association has focused its efforts on impeaching the Colonial Minister and dismissing Chief Secretary Kishimoto, aiming to force the Colonial Minister to resign and create a favorable atmosphere for the Political Friends Association. They plan to propose a vote of no confidence against Nagai, citing his insincere answers and discrepancies with the Prime Minister's responses. However, the government held an emergency cabinet meeting today and decided to handle the situation with courtesy. It remains to be seen what strategy the Political Friends Association will adopt during the budget general meeting. The Political Friends Association believes that Nagai's resignation will shake the Saito cabinet, and the association will bear the responsibility of bringing down the government.</p>
<h3>Secret Report on the May 15th Incident</h3>
<p>▲From Tokyo on the 26th by the China United News Agency: During the lower house plenary session on the 25th, Hamada Kunimatsu of the Political Friends Association urgently inquired about the details of the May 15th Incident. The Japanese government requested a closed session of the Diet for Internal Minister Yamamoto and Justice Minister Koyama to report on the incident's progress. It was decided that the details would be reported in the upper house on the 27th and in the lower house on the 28th.</p>
<h3>National Alliance to Propose Extension of Diet Session</h3>
<p>▲From Tokyo on the 26th by the China United News Agency: The National Alliance (Adachi faction) sent Yamamichi Jōichi to negotiate with the Political Friends Association today. They have decided to submit a proposal to extend the Diet session tomorrow. Although joint proposals are very difficult, the Political Friends Association will not oppose the idea.</p>
<h3>Ottawa Conference: British Delegation Returns Home</h3>
<p>▲From London on the 26th by Reuters: As the Empress of Britain entered Southampton today, all ships in the harbor raised flags and sounded their horns to show respect. The mayor and others boarded the ship to welcome Baldwin and others. Baldwin stated that he believed the trip to Ottawa by everyone had been a beneficial endeavor. Dominion Minister Thomas stated that the conference, from various points of view, could be considered a great success. A follow-up telegram stated that Baldwin and the other representatives arrived at Waterloo Station by train at 1:30 PM this afternoon. Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon flew in from the countryside a minute before to welcome them. Thomas and Baldwin were the first to disembark and shook hands with MacDonald and Simon with great enthusiasm. The crowd at the station cheered to show their respect.</p>
<p>▲From Chibaugh, England on the 26th by Reuters: The British delegation to the Ottawa Economic Conference arrived here today aboard the Empress of Britain and immediately released a statement saying that the agreements at Ottawa demonstrated a degree of success far exceeding what the British representatives had anticipated when leaving England. They firmly believe that the measures taken will increase trade between the various parts of the Empire and increase the Empire's prosperity. Its impact will certainly extend far beyond the Empire. Never before has an imperial conference achieved so much or shown so much promise for the future. If we had failed to demonstrate at Ottawa that Britain could solve its own economic problems with enterprise, our ability to influence the world economic conference, even if not destroyed, would have been weakened. Now that we have been able to do so, we have hope for the future. Looking back on the events of this year, we can see that we have emerged from an extraordinary depression. As the world is filled with this desire, we hope to move forward and firmly believe that the world conference will make solid progress towards a better era.</p>
<h3>Disturbances by the Nazi Party in Upper Silesia, Germany Continue</h3>
<p>Mass Demonstrations and Street Battles Throughout the Night</p>
<p>Government Determined to Dissolve Parliament</p>
<p>▲From Bushan, Germany on the 25th by Reuters: The serious situation that has arisen here since the sentencing to death of five Nazi Party members for murder is still ongoing. Street battles continued throughout the night as Nazi Party members, hearing rumors that the five would be transferred to a reformatory, held demonstrations. As a result, about 20 people were injured, mostly Nazi Party members. Many store windows were smashed, all of which were shops owned by Jews. The Nazi movement is now trending further toward anti-Semitism, as can be seen here. The Chief Administrator of Upper Silesia has issued an order prohibiting the use of freight cars and streetcars to transport party members and prohibiting political meetings at street corners.</p>
<p>▲From Berlin on the 26th by the National Society: Premier Papen held a long discussion with German industrialists Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach and Siemens on the government's economic plan. It is hoped that the implementation of this plan will reduce the number of unemployed. Authorities are currently silent on the content of the plan, only acknowledging that its implementation is likely to greatly surprise the public. The cabinet will decide on it at meetings on Saturday and Sunday. Newspapers that have recently joined the opposition party are speculating, with some saying the government will levy new industrial taxes, while others say it will force the wealthy to buy bonds to raise funds to implement the economic plan. However, well-informed circles say that such speculation is not credible. The convening of the current parliament is very important. It is feared that Premier Papen's plan will not be able to pass with a majority. It is now reliably learned that before attending parliament, Papen will go to East Prussia to meet President Hindenburg at his villa to discuss emergency measures, which will likely involve asking the President to order the dissolution of parliament in a crisis, and to clarify the direction the government should take after the dissolution of parliament.</p>
<h3>Spanish Restoration Leader Spared Death</h3>
<p>Reduced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>▲From Madrid on the 25th by Reuters: General Sanjurjo, the rebel general who was sentenced to death, has now been pardoned. After the verdict was announced, a magistrate entered the prison and read the verdict to Sanjurjo. The cabinet decided within 48 hours of the conviction to request the president to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment. Sanjurjo will likely be sent to a remote island in a Spanish colony to spend the rest of his life.</p>
<p>▲From Madrid on the 26th by Havas: General Sanjurjo left the Madrid military prison at dawn today and was taken to the Mahón military prison in the Balearic Islands, where he will be imprisoned for life.</p>
<h3>French Government Denies Changes in Diplomatic Personnel</h3>
<p>▲From Paris on the 25th by Havas: Rumors have been circulating about changes in the diplomatic corps in the coming days. The authorities have now firmly denied this.</p>
<h3>Britain Repays Loan to France</h3>
<p>▲From Paris on the 25th by Reuters: The British government has already repaid most of the loans it took out in Paris and New York last year to cope with the outflow of funds. The last part will also be repaid soon. After the New York Morgan banking group announced that it would not renew the British loan, the British Treasury stated that it had remitted funds to Paris to repay the £20 million in 4.5% treasury bonds purchased by French entities last year that are now due. French financial circles believe that Britain's buying of francs to repay the debt has weakened the price of the pound sterling, and that the market price of British currency may rise again thereafter.</p>
<h3>Statements by Debuchi Before Leaving America</h3>
<p>Said Conflict Unlikely Between Russia and Japan</p>
<p>Frank Bank Aboard Same Ship to China</p>
<p>▲From San Francisco on the 25th by the National Society: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Debuchi left here today aboard the Chichibu Maru for Yokohama, accompanied by his wife and daughter. His son was sent here and will return to Cranston to continue his studies. Although Debuchi traveled in a private capacity, he broke his silence before his departure and made a simple comment on the situation in the Far East, stating that relations between Japan and the United States have been disturbed on the surface only in the past year regarding the situation in Manchuria. As for the Soviet Union, he can foresee that there will be no conflict in Manchuria. Also traveling on the same ship was American film star Frank Bank, who is going to China for sightseeing, and Japanese athletes attending the World Games.</p>
<h3>Celebrations Held for Thousand-Year-Old Tree</h3>
<p>▲According to reports from the Paris newspaper, there is a large tree in Aigrefeuille, France, that is 1,300 years old. Recently, locals and a group of tourists held a celebration for the tree. According to historical records, King Charles II of England visited the tree in the 17th century, and King Louis XIV of France visited it in 1760. The tree's trunk is more than ten arm spans in circumference, and the hollow inside can accommodate forty children. (World Society)</p>
<h3>Dutch Swimmer Shows Great Skill</h3>
<p>Ventures to Fight Against Rapids</p>
<p>▲From Niagara Falls, Central America on the 25th by Havas: Lieutenant Rien, a Dutch swimmer attending the World Games, attempted to swim across the Niagara rapids below the 100-meter-high falls. The police, considering this to be a dangerous undertaking, tried to stop him, but Rien refused and plunged into the water, fighting the torrents and finally reaching the other shore safely. Hundreds if not thousands of spectators applauded Rien.</p>
<p>▲From Niagara Falls, USA on the 26th by Reuters: Lieutenant Rien, a famous Dutch swimmer, swam in the rapids above Niagara Falls yesterday, struggling forward to within only 100 yards of the edge of the great falls. Hundreds of people were viewing the scenery there when they suddenly saw someone jump into the rushing, foaming waters and swim freely, causing great alarm. They shouted to stop him, and the police also urged him to turn back. Rien ignored them and continued to swim forward. Although at times he seemed to be about to be swept by the force of the rapids into the roaring great falls, Rien finally landed safely. Police and onlookers rebuked him for disregarding his life too much. Rien replied, "I have been swimming all my life and have never encountered any real danger."</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Fourth Route of Righteous Army Occupies Sujiatun</h3>
<p>▲Fierce Fighting Also Occurs in Dahu Mountain</p>
<p>From Peiping (Beijing): The Fourth Route of the Liaoning Righteous Army, led by Geng Jizhou, and the deputy commander Wang Shengquan, with 1,700 men, attacked the Sujiatun Hunhebao area on the 17th of this month, engaging in fierce fighting with over 700 Japanese soldiers and over 800 troops of the puppet state in Shenyang for several hours. The enemy used artillery fire and aircraft to bombard the righteous army fiercely. Due to heavy threats, the righteous army changed its strategy, dispersing into smaller units and adopting a flanking formation. The enemy troops were attacked on three sides and began to retreat. The righteous army then occupied Sujiatun. That evening, the Japanese army greatly reinforced its forces, firing artillery remotely, while 16 aircraft dropped bombs to suppress the righteous army, which then retreated westward. In this battle, four puppet army instructors, including Japanese nationals Matsumori and Iida, were captured, along with four machine guns and over 110 rifles. Over 20 enemy soldiers were killed. Six soldiers and one company commander of the righteous army were killed in action. This unit, in close contact with the First Detachment led by Sun Zhuguo, is still actively advancing.</p>
<p>Another report states that the Third Detachment of the Fourth Route led by Geng Jizhou, commanded by Chai Huanzhang, with over 1,500 men, advanced southward along the Datong Road to take Dahu Mountain. They clashed with a certain division of the Japanese army. The Japanese army used smoke bombs to cover their advance. The righteous army, with a suicide squad wielding broadswords, ambushed from within the tall sorghum stalks, striking secretly. The Japanese army charged several times but ultimately failed, suffering many casualties. Later, the Japanese army, with a large number of cavalry, used machine guns and aircraft to cover their attack on the righteous army's position. The righteous army, seeing that reinforcements had not arrived, retreated north along the Datong Road. The Japanese army, with all its forces, intensified its pursuit. Fortunately, the Ninth Detachment of the righteous army, led by Wang Xianzhong, with over 1,400 men, arrived to reinforce them, and launched a large-scale counterattack. The Japanese army then retreated south. In this battle, the righteous army suffered heavy casualties, but captured two Japanese machine guns, one mortar, and five military vehicles. The Japanese army's casualties are unknown. The two detachments of the righteous army joined forces and destroyed over 20 li of the southern section of the Datong Road. They will attack Dahu Mountain again within a few days, and another fierce battle is expected.</p>
<h3>Decline of Remaining Bandits in Honghu</h3>
<p>▲Fengkou and Fuchang Have Been Recaptured</p>
<p>▲The Yuekou Administrative Office of the Pacification Headquarters is Abolished</p>
<p>From Hankou: The remaining bandits in Honghu had built strong fortifications in key areas such as Fengkou, Fuchang, Laoxinkou, and Shakou, in an attempt to hold out for a long time. However, the bandits who attacked Jingzhou and Shashi were defeated by Wang Lingji's troops and are now surrounded. The bandits inside the lake have lost contact and all external support. Furthermore, due to the strict blockade by government troops, they are suffering from a shortage of food, weapons, and ammunition. They want to break through, but cannot. On the 22nd, Pacification Director He Chengjun flew to Yuekou to consult with Xu Yuanquan on a thorough plan to eliminate the bandits. On the 24th, he ordered the troops to launch a fierce attack, and He himself flew to various key areas in Honghu, patrolling the area. Seeing that the bandits' strength was declining, he ordered Xu to be responsible for the suppression and returned to Hankou by plane to report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. The administrative office established by the Pacification Headquarters in Yuekou was also ordered to be abolished, and the staff, led by Chief of Staff Guan Linshu, returned to Hankou. They will be moved to southern Hubei within a few days. After He returned to Hankou, Xu Yuanquan, in accordance with the new plan, led his troops to forcibly cross the East Jing River from Beikou Street on the 24th. One part advanced toward Fuchang from Manbutou, and another part ambushed Fuchang from Xie Renkou and Lianzikou. The bandits, with no way to retreat, came out to meet the attack. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated one after another. Government troops bravely pursued them, breaking through their strong fortifications. Due to heavy casualties, the bandits broke through and fled in all directions, mostly retreating toward Sanguandian. The bandit lair in Fuchang was completely occupied by the brigades of Xu Jiwu and Huang Xin. In this battle, over 500 bandits were killed, 57 were captured alive, and over 100 rifles were seized. 25 officers and soldiers were killed in action. According to the prisoners, the bandits entrenched in Fuchang were the guard battalion of the puppet Third Army and the guard battalion of the puppet Seventh Division, with over 2,000 guerrillas. Those who resisted government troops west of Beikou Street were the puppet 19th Regiment and the puppet 3rd Guard Regiment.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Also, Fengkou, east of Fuchang, was recaptured by Zhang Wanxin's division on the same day, with many prisoners and even more bandits killed. The remaining bandits fled to Shakou. In addition, the 201st Regiment of the division attacked and advanced toward Shijiawan, occupying the area. The 199th Regiment also occupied Shangxia Liujiahe. The key areas of Honghu have all been captured by government troops, and the remaining bandits will not be difficult to eliminate. (August 25th)</p>
<h3>Hankou Local Merchant Embezzlement of Dike Funds Case</h3>
<p>▲The Main Culprit Was Allowed to Escape by the Court</p>
<p>▲Hu Shu Detained Pending Further Action</p>
<p>From Hankou: Cha Wenqu, the manager of the Hankou local merchant Chuanjianglong Company, and Liu Wenjin, the accountant of the Hubei Dike Works Funding Management Committee, jointly embezzled over 800,000 yuan of dike funds, leading to the unprecedented floods of last year. Many members of the Dike Committee were also slandered for negligence. The suspect Cha was captured after a reward was offered, and over 600,000 yuan was recovered. The suspect Liu was handed over by the former provincial government to the Wuchang District Court Procuratorate for interrogation, but the interrogation has not been completed after several months. Members of society have growing doubts. Zhang Nanxian, the director of the Supervisory Office of the Party and Government Committee of the General Headquarters, believed that the case was serious and that there might be a cover-up. He sent personnel to the provincial government to review the files and to the Wuchang District Court Detention Center to interrogate Liu Wenjin for verification. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the court's procuratorate, it was discovered that the suspect Liu had been released on bail by Hu Shu, the chief prosecutor of the court, and his current whereabouts are unknown. Upon receiving this report, Zhang recognized that Hu had intentionally allowed him to escape and that the impropriety was obvious. He reported to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, who was furious upon hearing the news. Today (the 25th), he ordered the Party and Government Committee and the Hubei Provincial Government to hand over the chief prosecutor Hu Shu to the military court for detention, and telegraphed the Judicial Yuan to punish him according to law. The telegram stated: "To President Ju of the Nanking Judicial Yuan, Upon investigation, Liu Wenjin, the accountant of the Hubei Dike Works Funding Management Committee, colluded with a special merchant to embezzle over 800,000 yuan of dike funds. Although some funds were recovered successively, there is still a huge debt of over 170,000 yuan. The Hubei Provincial Government compiled a list of the embezzled Hubei dike funds and sent Liu Wenjin to the Wuchang District Court Procuratorate for interrogation. In such a serious case with conclusive evidence, the suspect should be prosecuted and severely punished according to law to deter corruption. However, after more than four months, the chief prosecutor Hu Shu released him on bail under the pretext that the investigation period had expired. The impropriety is obvious. I, Chiang Kai-shek, fear that he will escape and have temporarily detained him pending your court's punishment according to law. Details will follow. I hereby telegraph, Chiang Kai-shek Seal."

<h3>Shandong Library Collects Chen's Antiquities</h3>
<p>▲Bricks, Tiles, Stone Carvings, and Coins</p>
<p>▲Of Great Significance to Documents</p>
<p>From Jinan: The most famous collections of antiquities in Shandong Province can be roughly divided into four families: Yang's Haiyuan Pavilion of Liaocheng for books, Chen Fuzhai of Weixian for bronzes and stone inscriptions, Wu Chongxi of Wudi for bronzes, stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, and Ding's of Huangxian for books. The most valuable, prestigious, and largest collection is Yang's Haiyuan Pavilion of books and Chen's bronzes and stone inscriptions. However, the Haiyuan Pavilion collection has been disrupted by years of turmoil, with some sold to foreigners, some destroyed by bandits, some purchased by the Shandong Provincial Library, and some valuable books stored in Tianjin, with another part of ordinary books stored in Jinan, scattered in pieces. Wu Chongxi of Wudi sold off all of his bronzes, stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, and Ding's of Huangxian also lost many of his books. As for Chen's collection of bronzes and stone inscriptions in Weixian, the most valuable item is the Mao Gong Ding, with fine bronze and clear inscriptions. Chen Fuzhai took great care in collecting it, wrapping it in blue cloth, then putting it in a box, and placing it in a locked cabinet. Family members could only take it out to see once a year, and outsiders could only participate in viewing it if they had a close relationship with the family and happened to be there when the family took it out. Later, Chen's descendants could not continue the aspirations of their ancestors and sold the Mao Gong Ding to Xu Shichang, who then re-pawned it to a foreign bank. Its current whereabouts are unknown. In addition, there is the Wanyinlou, which contains over 10,000 seals from various dynasties before the Qin and Han dynasties, and is also of great value. It is now said to have been transported to Tianjin and mortgaged to a foreign bank for 40,000 yuan. Negotiations are currently underway to sell it for 90,000 yuan, with Japanese nationals actively involved, and it is rumored that an agreement has been reached. However, the owner has stated that if the Shandong authorities purchase it, they are willing to reduce the price. It is said that Chen Shikun and Chen Yuchen, descendants of Chen, have come to Jinan due to various matters. Their collection of bronzes and stone inscriptions in Weixian also includes bricks, tiles, and stone carvings in ten categories, including 294 Qin and Han tile ends, 108 Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties bricks, 228 Qi legal currency clay coin molds, 14 pieces of Zhou and Qin pottery urn rims with inscriptions, one Six Dynasties tile statue, 38 Zhou, Qin, and Han pottery pieces, 20 Six Dynasties stone statue bases with inscriptions, two stone chimes, one Yuan magnetic jar, and coins from the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the Ming dynasty, totaling 1,489 pieces, all of which have great historical and documentary value. They are also currently negotiating a sale. Japanese nationals, upon hearing the news, flocked to negotiate. This matter was heard by Wang Xiantang, the director of the Shandong Provincial Library, who reported it to He Siyuan, the director of the Department of Education. He then sent Wang Xiantang to investigate and confirm the matter, and negotiated with the owner to have it preserved by the government. After repeated consultations, it was finally agreed that the 2,375 bricks, tiles, and stone carvings would be priced at 2,700 yuan, and the 1,489 coins from various dynasties would be priced at 300 yuan, for a total of 3,000 yuan, to be purchased by the Shandong Provincial Government. At the provincial government meeting on the 23rd, He Siyuan proposed to allocate funds to purchase them, which was immediately approved, as the antiquities are all unique and spectacular, and are important treasures for academic culture and of great historical significance. The proposal stated, "Upon investigation, Chen Fuzhai's collection of bronzes and stone inscriptions in Weixian was the best in the country at the end of the Qing Dynasty. He was skilled in appraisal and rich in collection. After his death, many of the antiquities he left behind were purchased by Germany and Japan six or seven years ago, such as the Ten Bells, Lord Jun Che's portrait, and the Cao Wang Xi stone carvings, which were shipped abroad one after another. All enlightened people lamented this. Recently, it was heard that his bricks, tiles, pottery, stone carvings, and ancient coins were also for sale. Japanese merchants flocked to hear the news. The Department of Education, in view of the government's intention to preserve antiquities, deeply feared that they would flow into foreign lands, and urgently sent Wang Xiantang, the director of the library, to investigate. It was confirmed that the matter was true, and after negotiating with the owner, it was agreed to preserve them by the government. After repeated consultations, an agreement was finally reached that the 2,375 bricks, tiles, and pottery pieces with inscriptions and patterns, packed in twenty-three boxes, together with twenty Six Dynasties stone statue bases, would be priced at 2,700 yuan in national currency. In addition, the 1,489 ancient coins from the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the Ming dynasty would be priced at 300 yuan, for a total of 3,864 pieces, priced at 3,000 yuan. This is the lowest price and cannot be reduced further. Compared to the current market price of antiquities, it is low, and even cheaper than the price offered by Japanese merchants by 800 yuan. The reason is that government preservation is different from private ownership, and this idea has been repeatedly conveyed to Chen's descendants, so they have been able to be particularly self-sacrificing. As for the relationship between these antiquities and academic culture, there are several aspects: (1) The 402 Qin, Han, and Six Dynasties bricks and tiles. These bricks and tiles are not only beautifully inscribed and patterned, but their materials, forms, and categories can all be used to study the crafts, living conditions, and construction methods of the Qin, Han, and Six Dynasties, and are extremely important and systematic historical materials. (2) The 1,721 pieces of pottery fragments from the Zhou and Qin dynasties with inscriptions. In modern Chinese paleography, in addition to the seal script of the Shuowen Jiezi, there are two newly discovered types: oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions. Many people have explored them and turned them into a specialized field of study. It is not known that the inscriptions on Zhou and Qin pottery are a separate branch from oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions, and their character formation and structure are even more different. Because they were unearthed in Linzi, Shandong, and were discovered in recent years, many in the domestic academic community have not had the opportunity to see them, and no one has devoted themselves to this. Their position in paleography is no less than that of oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions. In terms of time, they are from the Qi state of the various kingdoms; in terms of space, they are from Linzi, Qi, and are easier to access than the bronze inscriptions scattered in various places and difficult to verify. Now, there are more than 1,700 pieces, which are not only spectacular, but also an important treasure of the academic community. The greatest contribution of antiquities unearthed in Shandong to paleography in hundreds of years has never exceeded this. (3) The 228 'Qi Legal Currency' coin molds. These are the molds used to cast coins during the time of Duke Tai of Qi. The inscription on the molds is the three characters 'Qi Legal Currency', all made of clay. Collectors in the country occasionally obtain three or two pieces and regard them as secret treasures. Now, over 200 pieces have been collected, which is unique not only in the country, but also likely the largest collection of 'Qi Legal Currency' coin molds in the world. (4) The 1,509 ancient coins and stone carvings with statues. The evolution of the monetary system, forms, inscription casting, and regulations of various dynasties can be found in these ancient coins, which are valuable historical materials for ancient numismatics. The provincial library had previously acquired the Wang Hanshanfang coin collection, but due to the times, it was incomplete. These can be used to complete the collection. As for the Six Dynasties statues, their inscriptions have long occupied an important position in epigraphy, and there is no need to elaborate further. The above are all the main items; other scattered miscellaneous items are not included. Since the quantity is large, the price is low, and most of them are unique in the country, and the relationship with academic culture is so important, it is inappropriate to allow them to be scattered. It is proposed that the Shandong Provincial Library purchase them for preservation, for research purposes, in order to fulfill the government's intention to promote culture. As for the price of 3,000 yuan, it is proposed that it be allocated from the Department of Education's budget to ensure that it is available. Is this appropriate? The corresponding provisional budget is attached for public decision." (The budget is omitted)</p>
<h3>Westward Journey Notes (8)</h3>
<p>▲ As If in a Cradle</p>
<p>After we stayed overnight in Sanyuan, we planned to depart for Yaoxian at seven o'clock the next morning. However, Li Bailing of the Education Department rushed from Xi'an and insisted on inviting the entire group to a morning banquet. Although the group leader, Hu Boyuan, told him that we were rushing to leave and would accept his generous gift next time, Li was very sincere and we could not refuse. Therefore, our departure time was slightly later than originally planned. In addition, as there was a lot of luggage, the loading and arranging also took quite some time. It was not until about 10:20 am that we boarded the "jiawo" and set off.</p>
<p>"Jiawo" is also called a mule palanquin. It is named so because two mules are tied in front and behind the palanquin and carry it. The volume of the palanquin is quite large. In addition to ordinary luggage, it can accommodate two people sitting. If there is only one person, they can lie down in it. From the outside, it looks very comfortable, but it is very jerky and often jumps when moving. People who are not used to riding it find it quite uncomfortable. In addition, the palanquin has no fixed center of gravity and is prone to tilting to the left and right. Although the mules walk very slowly, the vibration experienced by the body when lying down makes the abdomen feel unusually uncomfortable up and down. This is because the direction and nature of the vibration are different from the vibrations of ordinary carriages, palanquins, boats, and wheels. Although we do not particularly welcome this hateful "jiawo", in the inland areas where transportation is inconvenient, ordinary people already regard it as a means of transportation for the noble class.</p>
<p>The itinerary for the entire group is approximately as follows, based on what is currently known:</p>
<p>(1) From Sanyuan to Yaoxian, passing through Yangdi Town, a flat road of 30 li, Lingqian Town, an uphill road of 10 li and a flat road of 15 li, Miyu Town, a flat road of 5 li, and Ma'an Town, a flat road of 20 li, totaling 80 li.</p>
<p>(2) From Yaoxian to Tongguan, passing through Huangpu Town, a flat dirt road of 30 li, Ershilipu (town name), a flat dirt road of 20 li, and then 20 li to Tongguan, totaling 70 li.</p>
<p>(3) The route from Tongguan to Yijun is 30 li of dirt slope road from Tongguan to Jinsuo Pass, 30 li of mountain slope road from Jinsuo Pass to Kuquan Town, and 30 li of uphill road from Kuquan Town to Yijun, totaling 90 li.</p>
<p>(4) The route from Yijun to Middle District is 40 li of downhill road from Yijun to Pianqiaozi Town, and 40 li of downhill road from Pianqiaozi Town to Middle District, totaling 80 li.</p>
<p>(5) The route from Middle District to Luochuan is 40 li from Middle District to Liantagou, 5 li from Lianshan Gou to Jiakou River, and 35 li from Jiakou River to Luochuan, totaling 80 li.</p>
<p>(6) The route from Luochuan to Fuxian is 15 li from Luochuan to Yanwang Bizi Jiudaoshou Mountain (the most difficult place to walk), 20 li from Jiudaoshou Mountain to Jianzi River, 25 li of uphill road from Jianzi River to Jiaodaoyuan, 15 li of downhill road from Jiaodaoyuan to Chafang, and 5 li from Chafang to Fuxian across the Luo River, totaling 80 li.</p>
<p>(7) The route from Fuxian to Ganquan is 20 li of riverbank road from Fuxian to Yulin Bridge, 20 li from Yulin Bridge to Daozuobao, and 40 li from Daozuobao to Ganquan, totaling 80 li.</p>
<p>(8) The route from Ganquan to Fushi is 30 li of mountain road from Ganquan to Laushan, 15 li of road from Laushan to Jiuyanshan Gou, 15 li of downhill road from Jiuyanshan to Sanshilipu, and 30 li of flat road from Sanshilipu to Fushi, totaling 90 li.</p>
<p>(9) The route from Fushi County to Yanchang County is 30 li from Fushi to Yangmao, 20 li from Yangmao to Yaodianzi Town, 25 li from Yaodianzi Town to Ganggulue, 40 li from Ganggulue to Heijiabao, 25 li from Heijiabao to Xihezigou, and 20 li from Xihezigou to Yanchang County, totaling 160 li.</p>
<p>The above is half of the entire itinerary of the Northern Group, which is disclosed in advance for readers to refer to when studying the Northwest issue. The remaining itinerary will be reported in detail when the notification is received later.</p>
<p>After we boarded the "jiawo," the grand procession moved towards Yaozhou.</p>
<p>There were a total of 25 "jiawo" hired. In addition to the "jiawo," there were also about a dozen donkeys and mules carrying luggage. In addition, there were more than 50 armed comrades in front and behind the team to protect us. Viewed from a high place, the entire team meandered like a ribbon, which was quite beautiful. However, we were undulating back and forth, left and right, in the "jiawo," as if we were back in the cradle. This special taste is unimaginable for people in the Southeast.</p>
<p>▲ Gunfire Signals Yaozhou's Nearness</p>
<p>We traveled slowly in the "jiawo" until about 1:00 PM when we reached Loudi Town. I am very impatient and unwilling to sit bored in the "jiawo," so I changed to ride the white horse of Section Chief Zhang of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. The horse walked a little faster, and I enjoyed the scenery while riding, which made me feel refreshed. However, because we started a little late and rested for a longer time on the way, it was already after 4:00 PM when we arrived at Miyu Town, and about 5:30 PM when we arrived at Ma'an Town. The sky was cloudy that day with no scorching sun, and the twilight seemed to arrive at the same speed as the "jiawo." After 7:00 PM, the sky gradually darkened. As we were hurrying along, we suddenly heard a gunshot on our left side. Although I did not move, I privately thought that if bandits were to swarm us at this time, we would be in danger. Although the soldiers did not show any panic, they were vigilant and paid close attention to the left side after hearing the sound. Fortunately, after one shot, no more shots were heard. Otherwise, the entire group of experts would have to visit the bandit den at least once and would inevitably suffer great fright.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM, the light seemed to be completely receding, no longer providing us with visual convenience. Fortunately, we were already approaching Yaozhou at this time. At 8:00 PM, we waded through the water of the Qi River. After dozens of steps, we vaguely saw the Yaozhou local authorities and others welcoming us outside the city. We entered the city and were led to the First Vocational School of the county to rest. It was 8:30 PM, and it was completely dark.</p>
<p>On the way, we saw a small stream near Yaozhou that flowed down from the mountains and irrigated the fields on both sides. As the water volume was not lacking, the crops were exceptionally lush. The cotton, which used to be as short as small grass, is now thriving, about three or four feet tall, flowering and bearing fruit, seemingly very proud. The sorghum is also very tall. Judging from the crops in the fields from all aspects, this place seems to have some of the features of Jiangnan and does not resemble the Shaanxi that people generally imagine. It seemed that because of our arrival, the ground in the city had been sprinkled with lime water to kill germs. When we entered the city, the sound of cannons rang out to welcome us, which made us feel uneasy.</p>
<p>After a night's rest, we got up at dawn. As Yaozhou is a coal-producing area, at about 9:30 AM, Group Leader Hu led mining expert Huang Bocizhi, geologists Feng Jinglan and Ma Jin, engineer Huang Xifan of Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory, secretary Ou Jianbang of the Longhai Railway, and myself, a total of six people and more than ten soldiers, to the Xincungou Coal Mine, which is located 25 li northeast of Yaoxian and 35 li southwest of Tongguan, to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The rest of the people inquired about other aspects of the situation in and around Yao County. As for those of us who inspected the coal mine, due to the heavy rain, after more than ten li, we feared that the road would be muddy and inconvenient to walk, so we hired several donkeys to replace our steps. At 12:00 PM, we crossed the Qi River and reached the coal mine. When we arrived, the mine was temporarily flooded by water and could not be mined, so work was temporarily suspended. Therefore, we could not enter the well, so we inspected everything at the mining site and obtained the following results:</p>
<p>(1) Location: Located 25 li northeast of Yaoxian County and 35 li southwest of Tongguan County, about one li west of the Qi River. The Qi River is shallow and cannot be navigated by boats. All coal is transported by pack animals.</p>
<p>(2) Coal Seam: The kiln has a vertical shaft opened in the valley. At 320 feet, the first layer of coal is encountered, with a thickness of about two or three feet to seven or eight feet. At 340 feet, the second layer of coal is encountered, with a thickness of two feet and eight inches. Five feet further down, the third layer of coal is encountered, with a thickness of three feet. The coal seams run northeast to southwest and slope about 10 degrees to the northwest.</p>
<p>(3) Coal Quality: According to the recent chemical analysis of coal quality by experts (in percentage):</p>
<p>Fixed Carbon: 68.74 Volatile Matter: 12.15</p>
<p>Ash: 15.18 Sulfur: 3.5</p>
<p>Heat Value: 83.93 The coal quality is smoky, with heavy sulfur, large lumps, and little fine dust.</p>
<p>(4) Shafts and Tunnels: The vertical shaft is circular, with a diameter of six feet, and is dug in the valley. The price of yellow earth is 30 yuan per zhang, and the price of rock is 200 yuan per zhang. Two wells are dug simultaneously, about ten feet apart, one for air intake and one for air exhaust. The cost of digging the wells is about 3,000 yuan. The brick house above the well is two zhang long and wide, and the construction cost is about 500 yuan. At the bottom of the well, the coal seams run northeast and southwest, opening tunnels for mining. The tunnels are three feet wide and five or six feet high. If the coal seam is too thin, the tunnel will be reduced in height, sometimes as low as three or four feet. Currently, the north and south level tunnels have each been dug for more than one li.</p>
<p>(5) Mining: There is no fixed mining method. Mining is stopped when water is encountered. Currently, mining is being carried out in the upper part because there is three feet of accumulated water in the deep part.</p>
<p>(6) Miners: There are 28 people working underground, including 8 people digging coal, 14 people pulling coal, and 6 people repairing roads. They work in two shifts, day and night, with 14 people per shift. The working time is 12 hours. There are 20 winch workers on the ground, with 10 people per shift. Each shift of diggers must dig 160-170 carts of coal, with each cart holding 70-80 catties of coal. The underground workers spend 18 days from entering the well to leaving the well. During these 18 days, they eat, sleep, and excrete in the well. This is called a "big shift" locally. Each big shift is paid 13.5 yuan, and the workers provide their own food and lamp oil. Each person needs 2 jiao for food and 4 liang for lamp oil per day, totaling 1 jiao 2.5 fen and 3 jiao 2.5 fen. The ground workers are paid 11 yuan per big shift because they do not need lamp oil, so the wages are lower. The coal mining time is about 6 months per year, totaling 10 big shifts. The labor cost is about 1.6 yuan per ton of coal.</p>
<p>The total number of workers above and below ground is 48, and they can produce about 20 tons of coal. The coal production rate per person is about 0.4 tons.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Physics Society</h3>
<p>▲ Passing the Constitution and Electing Officers</p>
<p>▲ Announcing Profound Research Paper Content</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The Chinese Physics Society held its inaugural meeting at 8:00 AM on the 23rd in Lecture Room 25 of the Science Building of Tsinghua University. The attendees included Xia Yuanli, Zhang Yihui, Ye Qisun, Wen Yuanmo, Yan Jici, Wang Shoujing, Wu Youxun, Sa Bendong, Zhu Guangcai, Wu Rui, Li Shuhua, Mei Yiqi, Long Jiyun, Zhang Peihu, Zhao Zhongyao, Ding Xielin, Zhang Yuche and 19 others. Chaired by Mei Yiqi, the meeting reported on the preparatory process, passed the constitution of the society, elected directors and officers, and scheduled the presentation of research papers and a dinner party for the 24th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech: Chairman Mei Yiqi delivered a speech, saying, "Today is the inaugural meeting of the Chinese Physics Society. I am honored to have gentlemen from the scientific community present at our school. On behalf of the faculty and staff of our school, I extend a sincere welcome. Regarding the preparatory process of this society, Mr. Ye Qisun will give a detailed report."</p>
<p>▲ Preparatory Process: Ye Qisun, a member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory process, saying, "In recent years, the number of people studying physics in our country has been increasing. People in the physics community, recognizing the need to gather and exchange ideas and to connect with each other, have long been brewing the idea of organizing a society. Last autumn, Mr. Langevin, a pioneer of the French Physics Society, came to China to investigate education. He arrived in Beijing in October and met with the physics community in Beijing, earnestly stating that China could not be without a physics society. This led to a meeting of 13 people from the physics community in Beijing, including Ye Qisun, Mei Yiqi, Xia Yuanli, Yan Jici, and Wang Shoujing, on November 1st. As a result, we first sent letters to the physics community across the country to solicit initiators for the Chinese Physics Society and drafted a temporary charter of 12 articles to solicit opinions. By the end of the month, we received replies from 54 people in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuchang, Hangzhou, Shandong, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, and other places, agreeing with the proposal. On December 13th, Ye Qisun and the other 12 people met again and revised and formally passed the charter based on the opinions in the replies from various places. They also decided to send letters to the initiators in various places and circulate ballots to elect seven temporary executive committee members to handle all affairs before the opening of the general assembly. On March 7th of this year, the election results were announced. Xia Yuanli, Hu Gangfu, Ye Qisun, Wang Shoujing, Wen Yuanmo, Wu Youxun, and Yan Jici were elected as temporary executive committee members of the Chinese Physics Society. They held two temporary executive committee meetings on March 29th and July 9th, and an important resolution was made to hold the inaugural meeting at Tsinghua University in Beijing starting on August 22nd. They also organized a general assembly preparatory committee, dividing it into three groups: reception, meeting schedule, and research papers, to carry out the preparations separately. Now that the date of the general assembly has arrived and the official officers will also be produced from this, my colleagues have accepted the initiation, and the gentlemen have entrusted me with the responsibility of the temporary executive committee member. This will also come to an end."</p>
<p>▲ Election Results: The chairman then announced the draft charter, which was amended and passed by the entire body one by one. Then, the directors, president, councilors, and other officers were elected. As a result, five directors were elected: Li Shuhua, Mei Yiqi, Xia Yuanli, Yan Renguang, and Ding Xielin. Li Shuhua was elected as the president, Ye Qisun as the vice president, Wu Youxun as the secretary, and Sa Bendong as the treasurer. Nine councilors were elected: Ding Xielin, Wang Shoujing, Hu Gangfu, Zhang Yihui, Yan Jici, Li Shuhua, Ye Qisun, Wu Youxun, and Sa Bendong.</p>
<p>▲ Presentation of Papers: At 7:00 AM on the 24th, there was breakfast, and at 8:00 AM, we joined the Chinese Mathematics and Physics Society to present research papers.

<h3>The People of Tangshan Again Request the Revocation of the Land Requisition Order</h3>
<p>▲ Requisition Area Totals Over 90,000 Mu</p>
<p>▲ 50,000 People Will Lose Their Jobs</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: The Artillery School of the Ministry of Military Affairs plans to requisition over 90,000 mu of land in the Tangshan area for the construction of a shooting range. The local people believe that the implementation of this measure will lead to the abandonment of 72 villages and the unemployment of 50,000 people. Therefore, they petitioned the authorities to change the plan, but it was not approved. Recently, they submitted another petition to the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan, appealing, "Regarding the requisition of land in the Tangshui Town area for the construction of an artillery shooting range, we are submitting a further report and requesting a change of plan to maintain the livelihood of the people. It is understood that the towns are surrounded by villages with thousands of households, and the area to be requisitioned is over 90,000 mu, resulting in the unemployment of 50,000 people. We petitioned for a change of plan and the revocation of the order. The Military Affairs Committee approved the petition, stating that the construction of the artillery shooting range is related to national military facilities and is extremely important, and should not be easily changed. However, considering the thousands of households that will be displaced, it is truly pitiful. Approval should be given to first requisition the most needed part, provide generous compensation, and allow them to relocate, with the rest to be handled gradually to show compassion. This demonstrates the consideration of both national interests and the livelihood of the people. However, who among the families whose land is being requisitioned is not a citizen? Having been granted generous compensation and having the most needed part requisitioned, and considering that artillery shooting is related to the consolidation of national defense, how dare we raise any objections? However, what we cannot refrain from saying is that there are so many villages, households, and farmlands near Tangshan, and the cost to the state for purchasing them will inevitably be enormous. For the people who are relocating, even though they are receiving generous compensation, it will be difficult to find suitable locations to make a living, and they will inevitably be scattered and displaced. The suffering and hardship will be unimaginable. All the farmers living within the land being requisitioned have a personal stake in the matter. Therefore, they have been running around and appealing, and have publicly elected representatives to submit another report and prostrate themselves to petition, earnestly requesting that the plan be changed in order to save public funds and consider the plight of the people, and that the order to requisition the land near Tangshan be revoked. They request that the artillery shooting range be built in a more remote and desolate area further away from the capital, so that national interests and the livelihood of the people can be served without any prejudice and with benefits. Therefore, the representatives are submitting another report and humbly requesting that the Council and the Executive Yuan consider the hardship of the people and the difficulty of the national treasury, and change the plan to find a remote and vast area for requisition and construction. We would be extremely grateful. If it is appropriate, we respectfully await your instructions. Respectfully submitted to the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan. Representatives of 73 villages in the 3rd and 5th districts of Jiangning, Zhang Kaixuan, et al."</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ President of the High Court Inspects Songjiang</p>
<p>Lin Biao, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, is determined to rectify the prisons and detention centers in various counties and to manage the prisoners. Today (the 26th), Lin, accompanied by his staff member Chen Ludan, arrived in Songjiang by express train and immediately went to the County Court. Judge Wang Sixian welcomed him and accompanied him to inspect everything. He inquired about the work in great detail and also spoke with each of the staff members individually. He then went to the detention center, where he was guided by Director Hu Jin to inspect the premises. He then went to the county prison, where he was accompanied by prison official Su Xiao to inspect the premises. He gave many instructions regarding prison hygiene. President Lin also mentioned that the funds for the Reformatory had been notified by the Finance Department to be allocated to the County Finance Bureau, but there was no such large amount of money available at the time. The High Court had repeatedly sent commissioners to Songjiang to negotiate, but with no results. Lin took the opportunity of being in Songjiang to visit Cai Zhongyu, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, intending to ask him to borrow the funds for the Reformatory from the financial community to facilitate the project.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Anti-Drug Association Opposes Public Sale of Opium</p>
<p>The idea of public sale of opium has been rife recently, and it is said that Sun Tiezhou has been internally appointed as the director of the Suzhou branch bureau. The National Anti-Drug Association of this place, in view of this, believes that at a time when the ban on opium is so strict, this absurd news has suddenly emerged. If this is true, it will not only make us a laughing stock among all nations, but also put the Premier's legacy and the National Government's prestige in jeopardy. Yesterday, they sent telegrams to the Opium Suppression Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation and a fight to the end.</p>
<p>▲ County Government Borrows Land Price Tax</p>
<p>County Chief Zou and Finance Bureau Chief Shen of Wuxian County, due to repeated orders from the province to allocate administrative funds, prison rations, and water and land taxes to various agencies, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan, but the county treasury was exhausted and unable to cope, and it was not feasible to delay for a long time, had no choice but to find a way to raise funds. They consulted with Shi Junqing, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and convened a meeting of the banking industry and business owners to discuss borrowing 100,000 yuan at interest, using the land price tax of the 21st year as collateral, for a term of six months. The County Chamber of Commerce is currently consulting with all parties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Request to Transfer Land Survey Fees to Replenish Grain Reserves</p>
<p>The grain reserve funds in Wuxi have been stopped since the ninth year of the Republic of China. After two instances of fair price sales in the 15th and 19th years, only about 20,000 yuan remained in the grain reserve account. Recently, due to the flood disaster last year and the silkworm famine this year, the local authorities decided to use the grain reserve funds for disaster relief, and almost all of the funds have been used up. After this, there will be no preparation for disaster relief. Therefore, Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the first district, together with the district chiefs of the other sixteen districts, jointly submitted a petition to the county government, stating that the land survey fees that have been ordered to be levied are already being collected, but there is no definite date for the implementation of the land survey. They requested that the urgent be given priority and that the levied funds be temporarily transferred for one year to be used as grain reserve funds for disaster relief and to benefit disaster relief. County Chief Chen, upon receiving the petition, has forwarded it to the provincial government.</p>
<p>▲ Hurricane Passes Through Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th), at daybreak, a hurricane suddenly struck the county, with flying sand and rocks, shaking the roofs and tiles. The shop signs of merchants were swaying. The wind subsided slightly in the afternoon. The early rice in the countryside, which was in the stage of flowering and bearing fruit, suffered some damage. The late rice, which had benefited from the autumn rains, was thriving, so there was little damage.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Boat Robbed in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>The Wuxi branch of the Wu County New Shipping Company's steamer was sailing to Wuxi on the 25th. When passing through Luoshe at about 3:00 PM, three robbers in military uniforms, armed with box cannons, suddenly boarded the boat and robbed it. None of the passengers were spared. The boats to Weicun and Lushu Bridge had also been robbed at Yangqiao the day before.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Northeast Postal Workers Arrive in Zhenjiang Last Night</p>
<p>Since the National Government sealed off the Northeast postal service, the employees of the postal districts of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, numbering about 10,000, did not want to work under the puppet government and were willing to enter the pass to work. Except for the employees of the postal districts of Jilin and Heilongjiang, who have not yet been able to travel due to the flood, there are already 3,700 employees from Liaoning and Ningxia who have entered the pass one after another. The Postal Administration has now assigned them to work in various provinces. A total of 100 people have been assigned to the Jiangsu and Anhui postal districts. Yesterday (the 25th), eight employees arrived in Zhenjiang by special express train from Beijing and Shanghai at 5:00 PM. The local postal workers' union had previously sent more than 20 representatives to the station to welcome them. They spoke at the station about their experiences of entering the pass. They were all moved to tears when they talked about their painful experiences. The union then invited the employees to a tea party and provided food and lodging to entertain them.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Bandit Alarm in the Eastern Countryside of Shaobo</p>
<p>In the vicinity of the Longwentang Temple in Shuixi, eastern countryside of Shaobo, the home of Zhu Xiulian was raided by several bandits on the night of the 18th day of the abolished lunar calendar. They captured Zhu's son Yunbo, hung him from a beam, and tortured him to extort money. When they failed, they ordered Zhu to quickly raise 200 yuan within a few days and personally send it to the bottom of the Yiling Bridge on the 21st night and call for Captain Jing to collect the money. They also searched and took a gold ring, a watch, and clothing before leaving. It was also heard that Du Yuanhua's grandson (7 years old) was kidnapped by bandits. Now, they have sent a letter to Du, asking him to redeem the ticket at a certain place.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲ Tax Police Protect Taxes and Defend Against Bandits</p>
<p>Mo Xiong, the commander of the Tax Police Corps of the Ministry of Finance, believes that banditry has been rampant in the Jiangbei area, with the green gauze tents providing cover. Therefore, he transferred the 4th Regiment under Lin Xiang's command to garrison in various counties to protect tax revenue and suppress bandits. Teams have been dispatched to Matang, Shigang, Sanyu, and Huashi Street in the three counties of Tong, Ru, and Hai.</p>
<p>▲ Finance Bureau Levies Land Price Tax</p>
<p>The Nantong Finance Bureau has decided to start levying the first installment of this year's land price tax from the 26th. The tax is levied at 11 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 7 li per liang.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Zhejiang Provincial Government Takes Over the Shatian Bureau</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Shatian Bureau was formerly under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. However, 5,000 yuan was allocated each month from the Shatian revenue to subsidize water conservancy funds in the province. Later, the provincial government, believing that Shatian was related to water conservancy throughout the province, decided to take over the bureau based on the resolution of the Executive Yuan. The Department of Finance established a Shatian Reorganization Office to use all revenue for water conservancy and education funding. Repeated requests were made to the Ministry of Finance to order the transfer, but there was no reply. The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that this case has been decided long ago and needs to be taken over urgently. Therefore, on the morning of the 26th, it sent Chen Shengkai and Wang Dingyuan, staff members of the Department of Finance, to take over. The Shatian Bureau refused to transfer, citing that it had not yet received an order from the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the provincial government and the Shatian Bureau have separately submitted reports to the Ministry of Finance requesting instructions.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>The Ninghai Warship, Built in Japan, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Partial Payment of Warship Construction Debt Made Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy's Ninghai-class cruiser, awarded to the Harima Shipbuilding Yard in Japan last year, has been under construction for two years. Despite extreme financial difficulties for the Navy, Minister Chen Shaokuan managed to raise funds and remit payments to Japan on schedule. Last year, during the Double Tenth Festival, the ship was launched in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. By the beginning of this month, it was fully completed. Chief Secretary and Supervisor Li Shijia traveled to Japan and personally led the ship back to China, arriving in Shanghai yesterday. The appointed captain and officers also boarded the ship yesterday afternoon. A flag-raising and oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for September 1st. Minister Chen Shaokuan also personally came to Shanghai yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Chen's Arrival in Shanghai: The ship, carrying Chief Secretary Li Shijia and the appointed engineering staff, departed from the Wusong Naval Port at 5:00 PM on Wednesday. Upon raising anchor, Li reported to Minister Chen Shaokuan via the ship's radio, estimating arrival in Shanghai yesterday morning. Upon receiving the report, Chen took an overnight express train from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday, arriving at the station at 8:00 AM yesterday. He immediately took a Jiangnan Shipyard car straight to Wusong. About half an hour after arriving at Wusong, the ship slowly entered the port. Due to a hurricane yesterday, it was inconvenient to board the ship, so Chen returned to the shipyard in the same car.</p>
<p>▲ Aircraft Welcome: Upon learning the confirmed arrival of the ship, the local Naval Aviation Department dispatched two seaplanes, Jianghe and Jiangou, to fly along the Huangpu River to Wusong to welcome the ship. They flew and circled in the sky as the ship entered the port. The two planes landed after the ship reached Gaochangmiao.</p>
<p>▲ Entry Details: The ship entered the port at 9:30 AM yesterday. The Yixian, which had arrived in Shanghai the night before, guided the ship, which then proceeded slowly. As it passed Yangshupu and the Huangpu River, it encountered the Jiangnan welcoming boat carrying Zeng Guocheng, the supervisor of the Pinghai ship, and representatives of the Navy. Due to the strong winds and waves, it was inconvenient to board the ship, so they turned back together. At the same time, personnel from various foreign ships docked in the port paid close attention to the ship's design and equipment. As it passed the Bund, a Japanese sailor accidentally fell into the river. As the ship was entering the port with a trial run flag, foreign ships did not raise flags or fire salutes. At 12:15 PM, the Yixian anchored off Gaochangmiao, and the ship followed, anchoring nearby.</p>
<p>▲ Anchoring Details: When the ship anchored off Gaochangmiao, all local naval units, such as the Training Fleet Headquarters, Aviation Department, Aircraft Manufacturing Department, Shipyard, entire Naval Guard Battalion, and the captains of ships docked at Gaochangmiao, including Luo Zhitong of the Zhongshan, Sa Shijun of the Chu Tai, Guan Ying of the Chu Qian, Liu Depu of the Ganlu, Liang Tongyi of the Qingtian, Wang Zhaoyuan of the Puan, Zheng Gongyao of the acting Minquan, and Wu Guangzong of the Hydrographic Office, lined up at the naval dock to welcome the ship. The ships sounded horns and raised flags. After anchoring, the captains boarded the ship via small motorboats to pay respects to Chief Secretary Li and inspect the internal equipment. They left the ship after more than an hour. The appointed captain of the ship, Gao Xianshen, had arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday on the Puan, awaiting orders to take office. Most of the other important officers were filled by engineering personnel who had supervised the ship's construction in Japan.</p>
<p>▲ Request for Construction Funds: After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the remaining construction cost of 1.9 million Japanese yen was discussed by Li with the shipyard in Japan, agreeing to pay it off in installments after the ship's arrival in Shanghai. Therefore, after the ship anchored, Minister Chen Shaokuan, accompanied by Luo Xuhe, the head of the Ministry of the Navy's Finance Department, drove to Qiqi Road to meet Finance Minister Song Ziwen, requesting Song to allocate funds. Song immediately allocated a portion of the funds, handing them to Chen to pay the shipyard first, with the remaining amount to be paid in installments soon after. ▲ Li's Remarks: After the ship docked, Director Li had important matters to attend to on the ship, so he did not disembark until 2:40 PM to pay respects to Minister Chen and report on the ship's arrival. The reporter of the Huadong News Agency met Li at the shipyard. According to him, the ship left the Wusong Naval Port in Japan the day before yesterday (Wednesday) at 5:00 PM, traveling at a speed of 25 miles per hour, and was thus able to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Accompanying him on the ship were Jimbo and Emura (Japanese), representatives of the Harima Shipbuilding Yard in Hyogo Prefecture that built the ship. Several other Japanese will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow on a Japanese merchant ship. The officers and men of the ship will be able to disembark and serve after reporting to the minister. They will go to Nanjing in a few days.</p>
<p>▲ Chen's Inspection: Minister Chen of the Navy went to the ship yesterday afternoon and inspected it thoroughly, expressing his satisfaction with the ship's equipment.</p>
<p>▲ Commencement of Work: At 3:00 PM, the appointment letters of all the ship's officers had arrived, so Captain Gao Xianshen led the officers and soldiers to the ship to take delivery. All parts were checked item by item by the assigned personnel without error, and work began immediately. The official flag raising and joining the fleet is scheduled for September 1st.</p>
<p>▲ Glimpse of the Ship: The ship's total equipment includes a length of 360 feet, a width of 39 feet, a draft of 13 feet, a displacement of 3,000 tons, a speed of 25 knots per hour, and a range of 6,000 nautical miles. The artillery includes three turrets, six twin-barreled 14-centimeter automatic gun turrets, two groups of eight-centimeter anti-aircraft guns, totaling six guns, four twin-mounted 21-inch torpedo launchers, one reconnaissance aircraft, two searchlights, wireless telephone, wireless radio direction finder, etc. The hull is dark gray, and the area below the waterline is black. It is a state-of-the-art light cruiser.</p>
<p>▲ Total Crew: The ship's total crew includes 42 officers, including Captain Gao Xianshen, Executive Officer Wang Zhiguang, Chief Engineer Lin Huiping, Gunnery Officer Xue Jiasheng, Torpedo Officer Zeng Guoqi, Electrical Officer Xu Yu, and Navigation Officer Guo Mingji, and 319 soldiers, totaling 361 people. The ship will sail to the capital after the flag-raising ceremony.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Postpones Trip to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Because His Mother is Ill and Cannot Travel by Boat</p>
<p>Central Committee member Sun Ke had wired his Shanghai residence, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday by boat with his mother. It is now learned that Sun wired his Shanghai friends again, stating that his mother had suddenly fallen slightly ill and it was inconvenient for her to travel by boat, so he would not be able to make the trip as scheduled and would postpone his arrival in Shanghai for a few days.</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai's Activities Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Visited Chen Mingshu for Important Discussions</p>
<p>▲ Fujian Compatriots in Shanghai Petitioned Cai</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Cai Tingkai, commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army and Pacification Commissioner of Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai aboard the Zhishaluya steamer the day before yesterday. After a brief stay, he plans to go to Nanjing to report to the central government on the situation of bandit suppression in Fujian Province. The night before last, Cai stayed temporarily at the residence of Finance Minister Song on Qiqi Road. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, he left Song's residence and went to the Cangzhou Hotel to meet Fan Qiwu and others, and had a light breakfast at Cangzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Important Meeting at Chen's Residence: At 7:30 AM, he drove to the private residence of Chen Mingshu on Shanzhong Road. At the same time, he also summoned officers of the 19th Route Army staying in Shanghai to hold a meeting at Chen's residence. Chen Fumu, Du, and Lu Wenlan were the first to arrive at Chen's residence. Soon after, Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command Zhang Xiang, former Director of the 19th Route Army's Shanghai Office Fan Qiwu, and Sun Xiwen all arrived and the meeting began. It is said that the financial and bandit suppression matters of Fujian Province were discussed. The meeting lasted until noon. Cai returned to Song's residence to rest.</p>
<p>▲ Fujian People in Shanghai Visited Cai: At 10:00 AM yesterday, representatives of the Xinghua Fellow Association of Fujian in Shanghai and the Fujian Fellow Association in Shanghai, as well as other organizations, totaling more than 20 people, carrying a petition, went to Song's residence on Qiqi Road to visit Cai, requesting Cai to reduce and exempt the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in Fujian Province, to stop the local tyrants from oppressing the people, and to eliminate the bandits and communists as soon as possible, in order to save the people of Fujian from their suffering. However, Cai had already gone to Chen Mingshu's residence for a meeting, so they were unable to meet him. It is said that after Cai finishes his business in Shanghai, he will fly to Nanjing with Finance Minister Song this morning.</p>
<h3>Banking Community Demands Lower Tax Rate on Paper Currency</h3>
<p>▲ Reduced from 2.5% to 1%</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Finance Minister Song Ziwen received Mayor Wu, Hu Bijang, and Li Fusun at his residence yesterday to discuss issues such as the collection of paper currency tax.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the Paper Currency Tax, the banking community has repeatedly discussed the issue of reducing the paper currency issuance tax rate. As a result, the Ministry of Finance proposed a solution, agreeing to reduce the issuance tax rate to some extent. The intermediary parties have collected the opinions of various banks issuing paper currency regarding this solution. However, the banking community believes that this solution is still unsatisfactory and requires the Ministry of Finance to reduce the paper currency issuance tax rate from 2.5% to 1%. Li Fusun, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Hu Bijang, Manager of Zhongnan Bank, specifically visited Minister Song yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to continue the discussion. Li left first due to other matters, while Hu did not leave until 11:00 AM. In addition, Mayor Wu, Yang Xingfo, Wen Yingshing, Wang Xiaolai, and Chu Huiseng also visited Minister Song yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Bijang's Remarks: The reporter met Hu Bijang at Song's residence yesterday. According to Tan, the Ministry of Finance is collecting paper currency issuance tax to remedy the financial situation, collecting 2.5% of the reserve guarantee according to the paper currency issuance tax rate promulgated in 1930. The banking community believes that the 2.5% tax rate is too high and calls for a reduction. The Ministry of Finance has already expressed some willingness to reduce the rate. The Ministry of Finance is also in talks with the Shanghai banking community to negotiate a loan.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu's Remarks: Mayor Wu told the reporter at the Municipal Government yesterday that Minister Song had agreed to be responsible for acting as Premier of the Executive Yuan. The date of going to Nanjing has not yet been determined. He visited Minister Song today (yesterday) just to have a casual conversation.</p>
<h3>The Typhoon Has Passed Wenzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Some Ocean-Going Ships Have Set Sail</p>
<p>This Shanghai typhoon lasted for four days. More than ten Min-Zhe ocean-going ships were blocked from leaving port. Until yesterday, the typhoon landed in Wenzhou, and some ocean-going ships have successively set sail. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Typhoon Passed: From Tuesday to yesterday, the typhoon's direction was always over the sea near Wenzhou. Yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that Shanghai would have showers this morning, and the typhoon had landed from the sea near Wenzhou, blowing northwest, seemingly heading towards Jiangxi. The typhoon will turn from the Yangtze River to Japan, so yesterday the Yangtze River coast had showers and strong winds.</p>
<p>▲ Ningbo Ships Arrived in Shanghai: The Ningbo liners New Beijing and New Ning Shao set out from Zhenhai the night before, braving strong winds and rain to go to Shanghai. Both arrived safely yesterday morning. Although the journey was difficult, fortunately no accidents occurred. After the passengers disembarked, they unloaded the cargo. That day, Taikoo Ningshao, in order to ensure safe navigation, ordered the two ships to suspend their services. Ningbo liners have been suspended for a total of four days this week. The New Jiangtian and Ningxing will depart today.</p>
<p>▲ Ships That Set Sail First: The China Merchants ship New Feng, which was sheltering from the wind outside the Wusong estuary, was heading to Beiyang, and the Guangji was heading to Wenzhou, as well as the Shanghai-Taiwanese ships, which had been anchored outside the Wusong estuary for two days. Yesterday morning, after hearing that the typhoon had landed on the Wenzhou Ocean, they raised anchor and set sail. In addition, the Tianjin Maru of Dalian, the Haiyan of China Merchants, and the Nanhai of Taikoo Yihai also sent telegrams yesterday reporting that they were en route. It is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Organizations Discuss Local Security</h3>
<p>▲ Emergency Joint Meeting Convened Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Letter Sent to the Public Works Department Requesting Protection of Police Power</p>
<p>The Hongkou District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Federation and the joint offices of more than 20 organizations including the Chambers of Commerce of Hanbury Road, Wuzhou Road, Dongyouheng Road, Jiaxing Road, Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, Arerjin Road, North Jiangxi Road, Yinxiang Road, and Huade Road, convened an emergency joint meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 representatives, including Zhang Xianfang, Wang Rongtang, Zeng Zhiyu, Liu Zhongying, Chen Jiabao, Fei Liangheng, Xing Guxiang, Zheng Dongshan, Zhu Baoluo, Zhu Zhichun, and Qiu Jialiang, were present. Zhu Baoluo was elected as chairman and Zheng Dongshan as secretary. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Since January 28th, the commerce in this area has been in a state of decline and has not recovered its vitality. Japanese people should not organize any group activities to avoid causing panic among citizens. The following was resolved after discussion: A. Submit a petition to the Municipal Government to severely protest the actions of the Japanese. Representatives Zhang Xianfang, Wang Rongtang, Xing Guxiang, Liu Zhongying, Qiu Jialiang, and Zheng Dongshan will go to the Municipal Government to petition. B. Send a letter to the Public Works Department requesting the protection of police power, maintenance of security, and provision of a peaceful and prosperous life for citizens. C. Send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association requesting prompt attention to the safety of taxpayers and strict negotiations. The two letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting Protection of Police Power: Wusong Road, Hanbury Road, Wuzhou Road, Haining Road, Kunshan Road, and other places in Hongkou are areas ruled by the Public Concession, and are especially within the scope of the Public Works Department's police power. Since the Shanghai incident caused by the Japanese army, local commerce has been devastated and has not yet recovered its vitality. Just as the merchants and people were enduring the pain and reorganizing their businesses after their shock, the Japanese Marines carried out armed parades and demonstrations with armored vehicles, etc. in the area, and wantonly destroyed factory fences and stabbed people. Now, the situation is getting worse. Japanese ruffians have formed the "Red Clothing Security Corps," and Japanese groups have jointly organized the "Japanese Police Corps," divided into patrol, reconnaissance, and protection groups, each with 20 members, who are constantly moving around in the Hongkou area. They also send letters of intimidation from the Red Clothing Security Corps, causing residents to panic and commerce to be disturbed. Such a dangerous situation turns the recovering market into a world of fear. The fact that the Japanese are allowed to do whatever they want and disregard the Public Works Department's police power is outrageous. As your department is responsible for protecting the local area, how can you allow this to happen? If you allow the Japanese to act freely and do not stop them quickly, causing your department's police power to be lost and the public treaty to be violated, then all countries can send troops and police to protect their people, so why can't our Chinese troops protect our Chinese people? The joint meeting of representatives of various groups in this district has decided to maintain justice, protect the treaty, and maintain security within the concession. No foreign troops or police should act freely beyond their authority. The Public Works Department should be responsible for implementing the treaty, fully maintaining local power, and stabilizing the market and commerce. A record of this letter is specially sent to you. We urge your department to make a strong representation, eliminate the illegal organizations of Japanese ruffians, increase the deployment of Chinese and Western detectives, and strengthen protection so that citizens can live and work in peace. We are deeply and urgently awaiting your reply.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Taxpayers' Association to Negotiate Strictly: Japanese ruffians dare to suddenly organize Japanese police groups in the Hongkou market, which is about to recover, dividing them into patrol, reconnaissance, and protection groups, each assigning 20 members to carry out their activities separately, and organizing a Red Clothing Security Corps to move around everywhere and send letters of intimidation, causing merchants and people in the North Sichuan Road area to be extremely frightened and their businesses to be greatly affected. This has caused security issues and police power concerns within the concession. The Public Works Department is entrusted by the taxpayers of the city and is responsible for protection. How can the police power be allowed to be freely active by the Japanese within the jurisdiction? The loss of police power violates the treaty. How can our Chinese taxpayers fulfill their obligation to pay taxes in a terrifying environment where they cannot live and work in peace? We urge the Public Works Department to pay close attention, protect and maintain the police power to maintain security, and quickly eliminate the actions of Japanese ruffians to stabilize the local area and maintain public safety. Your association, as a group of taxpayers, should maintain local peace and tranquility. Please make a serious negotiation with the Public Works Department as soon as possible, and we hope that the details of the negotiation will be reported to us as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Install Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>▲ Related to Communication Equipment</p>
<p>▲ Not a Wartime Deployment</p>
<p>▲ Rumors Are Exaggerated</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a certain evening newspaper reported yesterday that the Japanese Marines were implementing wartime deployments. A certain Japanese evening newspaper also published a photograph of the installation of military telephones the day before yesterday, titled "Our Marines Are Tense." This kind of reporting can easily cause panic among the residents of Shanghai after the war. The reporter specifically went to the North Sichuan Road area to inspect and saw pedestrians coming and going without any panic. When asked, shop clerks said that several Japanese soldiers did install wires in the North Sichuan Road area the day before yesterday afternoon. The line was connected from the Marine Headquarters, through North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road, to a certain wood factory on Wusong Road. Japanese soldiers have been seen entering and leaving that place, which seems to be a place where Japanese soldiers are stationed. The installation of telephone lines is clearly a kind of communication equipment. The wartime deployment mentioned in a certain newspaper seems to be an exaggeration.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consul Responds to Our Protest</h3>
<p>▲ Denies Armed Demonstration by Japanese Troops Across the Border</p>
<p>▲ Claims Our Newspapers Report Groundless Rumors</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received a reply from the Japanese Consul-General yesterday regarding our protest: In response to your letter of August 16, which states that the armed demonstration by the troops of your country in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas has caused unrest among the residents and is deemed inappropriate, and requests that the military authorities be informed to stop the aforementioned actions, I have received your letter. I immediately forwarded it to the Marine Corps Headquarters, which replied that the Marines strictly abide by the provisions of the ceasefire agreement and have never taken any action such as a demonstration across the border. Your protests are not acceptable. The main points of the reply are as follows: The Marine Corps side notified your side when withdrawing from the occupied areas of Zhabei that, after the withdrawal, we would notify your side in advance if we wanted to visit the war sites in Zhabei before doing so. Your side allowed this at the time. Since then, we have always kept our promise, and your side has always viewed our visits with suspicion. In particular, journalists who do not understand the situation regard the passage of unarmed soldiers as an act of demonstration that infringes on Chinese sovereignty, and make groundless reports. Chinese newspapers have successively published such news. The first item of the facts narrated in the note sent by your side is that the Marine Corps soldiers visited the war sites in the Baziqiao area of Zhabei after clearly notifying your authorities, but the local police misunderstood. The second item is that, after clearly notifying your authorities in advance, they transported the rest equipment used by the commander of the Third Fleet during his inspection of the Wusong area, but this was misunderstood. The third and fourth items are completely untrue. As mentioned earlier, the Marine Corps side always takes into account the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and strictly prohibits the actions of all units from violating the agreement. The units never enter the Chinese territory without permission in their daily activities. If it is necessary to go to the Chinese territory, they must act after clearly notifying your authorities. Based on the above, the Marine Corps has not taken any actions such as demonstrations across the border and cannot accept the protest. It has been confirmed that the facts mentioned in your letter are unfounded, as stated in the reply from the Marine Corps Headquarters. What your side needs to pay more attention to is that the public security bureau police in the areas are causing malicious propaganda to be done by reporters of your country, who are creating unfounded news and failing to verify the facts. They are reporting their misunderstandings to their superiors, which is reckless. It goes without saying that it is dangerous to report based on such erroneous information. I hope that your government will pay special attention to this point. In response to your letter, I respectfully request that you examine the matter. Yours truly, Murai Kuramatsu, Japanese Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, to Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Announcement by Japanese Marine Corps Commander Sugisaka Yasuharu</h3>
<p>▲ The Implied Meaning Contains a Threat to Chinese People</p>
<p>According to the Times News Agency, Sugisaka, the commander of the Japanese Marines, posted an announcement to reassure Japanese residents in the Japanese residential area of Hongkou. The full text of the translation is as follows: Announcement: Because the sinister hand of conspiracy of the Blood Soul Elimination Troupe, etc. has gradually extended to the Hongkou area, the police of the Public Works Department and the Japanese Consulate have now decided to take strict precautions. For the sake of preventing any unforeseen events, the Japanese Marines have stationed troops in front of the Japanese Telegraph Bureau (according to the reporter, the actual number of Japanese soldiers stationed at the Japanese Telegraph Bureau is definitely more than 120, about five or six teams), and increased patrol forces to provide security. The conspiracies caused by the Chinese side ignoring the ceasefire agreement are endless. It is a tragedy for the permanent peace of Shanghai. In the future, if an incident breaks out suddenly, our military authorities stationed in Shanghai are prepared to take full measures. I hope that all expatriates will live and work in peace, and please do not disturb each other, so as not to give the enemy an opportunity to make trouble. Sugisaka, Commander of the Japanese Naval Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Visited Zhabei War Zone Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ A Total of 112 People in Four Trucks</p>
<p>▲ A Second Batch Will Visit Today</p>
<p>According to the Times News Agency, Sugisaka, commander of the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai, informed the Municipal Government that 150 newly transferred Marines would visit the war zone in Zhabei in two groups on the 26th and 27th of this month, requesting permission. After a period of consideration, Mayor Wu Tiecheng replied, agreeing to the visit, but the soldiers should not carry weapons to avoid misunderstandings by the residents of Zhabei. At the same time, he ordered the director of the Fifth District, He Yiming, to solemnly announce to the residents of Zhabei not to disturb each other when the Japanese soldiers passed by, and ordered the police to accompany and guide them when the Japanese soldiers arrived in Zhabei. At 1:15 PM yesterday, the first group of 112 Marines who visited Zhabei took four large trucks and departed from the Japanese Naval Headquarters on Jiangwan Road. They turned west and went to Baoxing Road, then turned to Baoshan Road and slowly drove the trucks south. Before the trucks, the Fifth District Director He Yiming sent two police patrol teams to lead the way by car. When the Japanese soldiers passed through various places, the general residents were panicked. After the Fifth District police explained in detail, the people's hearts began to calm down. As for the second batch of Japanese Marines who will visit Zhabei, they will also depart from Zhabei at 1:00 PM this afternoon in two trucks.</p>
<h3>Liu, a Member of the Nanhui Regiment, Goes to Northeast China to Fight Against Japan</h3>
<p>Liu Jianming, a member of the Nanhui County Security Regiment Headquarters, is skilled in combat. Recently, seeing the Japanese army invading North China, he was filled with righteous indignation. He took leave of absence on the 24th to go to Shanghai and take a ship to Northeast China to fight against Japan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Mosques Recite Scriptures and Pray for Ma Fuxiang</h3>
<p>After the death of Ma Fuxiang, a member of the National Government, Shanghai Muslims regarded Ma as a leader of Islam. He usually maintained religion, revitalized education, and donated huge sums for the construction of mosques and charitable causes. He also published more than 100 kinds of Islamic books, which circulated in various provinces and made great contributions to Islam. Yesterday (the 26th), the Shanghai Qingzhen West Temple, South Temple, North Temple, Foreign Temple, etc., recited the heavenly scriptures to pray for Ma. On that day, more than a thousand people from the heads of the temples, Al Jureili, and various Islamic organizations came to the temples to pray. The imams preached the holy arguments of Muhammad. Everyone who came to the temples expressed their condolences and listened respectfully on their knees. The Islamic Theological Seminary also prayed together after the evening worship. In addition, the China Islamic Church, the Shanghai Qingzhen Board of Directors, various mosques, the Islamic Theological Seminary, Dunhua Primary School, and the Islamic Orphanage also plan to hold a memorial meeting. The memorial ceremony is currently being discussed. This is also enough to show how deeply Ma moved people and how great his contribution to supporting Islam was, so later generations cannot forget him after his death.</p>

<h3>The Peiping Police Force Has Not Returned North</h3>
<p>▲ Lu Lu Takes Leave From Shanghai Due to Other Business</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that, in order to increase police strength and maintain strict post-war security, the city previously requested that the Peiping authorities transfer a large Peiping police detachment to Shanghai. Lu Lu led the detachment to Shanghai at that time. Yesterday's newspaper reported that Lu Lu led 500 Peiping police officers back to Peiping. Yesterday, a spokesperson for the municipal government said that the Peiping police detachment led by Lu Lu to Shanghai had already been assigned to various district offices and security departments of the Public Safety Bureau. Lu Lu took leave from Shanghai due to other business. The reports in yesterday's newspapers were completely untrue.</p>

<h3>Record of the Congress of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee</h3>
<p>Because the chairman of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, Zhu Qinglan, departed for the Northeast, the vice chairman, Zheng Hongnian, devoted himself to education, and the director-general, Wu Shan, was developing the road association's plan and could not attend to other duties, they all resigned. A congress was convened on the 24th of this month at 6:00 PM at Yipinxian Restaurant to discuss this matter.

Vice Chairman Xu Shiying was promoted to chairman, and Li Denghui and Zhao Yu were added as vice chairmen. The resignation of Director-General Wu was not accepted, and Committee Members Li (vice chairman), Chairman Xu, and Qiu Hanping were recommended to revise the association's constitution for discussion at the next congress.

<h3>Fifteen Hundred Dockworkers Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ To the Municipal Government in the Morning, To the Party Headquarters in the Afternoon</p>
<p>▲ Satisfied With the Results, Did Not Go to the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The dispute over the 20/80 wage system for dockworkers in the city, which was handled by a specialist sent from the Central People's Movement Committee and the Industrial Department along with local authorities, saw fifteen hundred dockworkers from North and South Shanghai and Pudong gather yesterday morning to petition party and government agencies. The municipal government, having been informed in advance and fearing an accident due to the large number of people, specially dispatched two battalions of security police for temporary martial law. Fortunately, no incident occurred in the evening. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Background of the Dispute ▲ Workers at the following docks in the city: Dulai Wharf, Zhonghua Wharf, Hexing Wharf, Coal Industry Wharf, Hanyang Wharf, Ronglin Wharf, Yitaixing, Nanyitaixing, Beihua Wharf, Tongchunfu Wharf, Nisshin Wharf, Okura Wharf, Dongsheng Wharf, China Merchants New Pier, Huatong Wharf, Hongsheng Wharf, Taikoo Company Pier, Longmao Wharf, Taitong Wharf, New Mitsui Pier, Qichang Pier, New Huishan Wharf, China Merchants Huajian Wharf, Yangzi Wharf, Kaiping Wharf, Asiatic Petroleum (Upper and Lower), Blue Funnel Wharf, Old Mitsui Wharf, New Mobil Wharf, Huaxing Wharf, Beipiao Wharf, Sanbei Wharf, Ning Shao Wharf, Dada Wharf, Datong Wharf, Dachu Warehouse, Jinliyuan, Taikoo Wharf, Toyo Company, China Merchants Central Wharf, Gonghexing Wharf, China Merchants North Wharf, Huishan Wharf, Osaka Wharf, Huashun Wharf, Huangpu Wharf, and others, demanded the implementation of the 20/80 wage system. The Central People's Movement Committee and the Industrial Department, regarding the matter as important, sent Wang Diwen and Zhang Tiejun to Shanghai to handle the case. The local authorities, including Director Chen Kecheng from the municipal government, Director Wang Manyun from the municipal party headquarters, Director Wang Gang from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Director Wang Guoxian from the Public Security Bureau, assisted in handling the case. Labor and management were summoned for mediation, but no concrete solution was reached. Negotiations are currently underway in an effort to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Temporary Martial Law The municipal government, having been informed the night before that dockworkers would hold a large petition at party and government agencies, and fearing an accident due to the large number of workers, immediately ordered the Security Brigade Police Brigade to take special precautions. At 4:30 AM yesterday, the Security Brigade ordered a squad of armed police officers to be stationed at the Social Affairs Bureau on Xiaonanmen and the party headquarters on Fangxie Road. At the same time, a company was stationed at the municipal government on Fenglin Bridge and set up guard posts nearby. At 6:00 AM, the Public Security Bureau Police Brigade also dispatched a squad each to the Social Affairs Bureau, the party headquarters, and key roads in the southern city. Police officers from each district also set up defenses. Special temporary martial law was in effect at the entrance of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government's Response Yesterday morning, over fifteen hundred dockworkers gathered at the Da Nanmen Dockworkers' Union Organizing Committee at 7:30 AM and set off on foot to petition the municipal government. When they reached Xiexu Road, they were stopped by security police officers and could not proceed. Chen Haiqiu, Wu Ziying, Yu Desheng, Zhou Zhangqing, Tang Yuhua, and five others were allowed to continue as representatives to the municipal government, while the remaining workers dispersed and stayed on Xiexu Road and other locations. At 11:00 AM, Secretary Wang Shao received the representatives, who presented (1) a demand for the implementation of the 20/80 system, (2) a demand that the three foremen hand over the contracts, and (3) a demand for forced execution if the contracts were not handed over. Secretary Wang replied that the central government had already sent a specialist to Shanghai to handle the dockworkers' 20/80 system case, and the municipal government had also ordered the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to assist the central government specialist in handling the matter properly. The representatives withdrew at 12:10 PM.</p>
<p>▲ The Party Headquarters' Response The representatives then led the workers on foot to the party headquarters on Fangxie Road. It was 2:30 PM. They were received by Director Wang Manyun of the Civil Training Section. The representatives stated: (1) The committee members of the Dockworkers' Union Organizing Committee appointed by the municipal party headquarters were considered inappropriate and requested to be replaced; (2) They demanded the immediate implementation of the 20/80 system. Director Wang replied that the reorganization of the Dockworkers' Organizing Committee required approval from the municipal executive committee, and that the 20/80 system was a task that the Kuomintang should undertake and would be coordinated with the central government in an effort to mediate. He also explained this to the masses. By this time, most of the petitioning workers had dispersed, leaving only three or four hundred people. At 3:30 PM, the crowd was satisfied and dispersed, but the security and police brigades stationed at the Social Affairs Bureau and the party headquarters did not withdraw until the evening.</p>
<h3>Workers on Hunger Strike at Sanyou Factory Resumed Eating Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Party and Government Agencies Issued a Jointly Signed Proclamation</p>
<p>▲ All Started With Rice Gruel Last Night</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that Hong Jiaben and other workers at the Sanyou Industrial Company's main factory in Yinxiang Port, who had been on hunger strike since the 18th, were on their ninth day yesterday. Party and government agencies, fearing that the workers' prolonged hunger strike might lead to danger, specially issued a jointly signed proclamation yesterday and sent personnel to persuade them to resume eating. The workers have expressed acceptance and announced that they will all resume eating starting yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Joint Proclamation The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Executive Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a jointly signed proclamation yesterday, stating: "Concerning the Sanyou Industrial Company's Yinxiang Township main factory shutdown, which has led to a labor-management dispute, this committee and bureau's mediation has been ineffective, and the matter remains unresolved, causing some workers to sacrifice their lives and fight through hunger strike, which is deeply regrettable. However, this case has now been submitted by the municipal government to the arbitration committee, and all parties will be summoned to arbitrate in accordance with the law soon. Therefore, the resolution of this dispute is expected. The hunger-striking workers should immediately resume eating to preserve their lives. This jointly signed and earnestly worded proclamation is hereby issued, urging you, the hunger-striking workers, to resume eating immediately and await the municipal government's legal ruling. This is of utmost importance. Sincerely, on August 26th, the 21st year of the Republic of China." Standing Committee Members Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Tao Baichuan, and Bureau Chief Wu Xingya.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Personnel for Persuasion At 3:00 PM yesterday, Yu Zhongbiao from the Civil Training Section of the municipal party headquarters and Chen Mingshan from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, accompanied by Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai, members of the municipal Federation of Trade Unions, went to Shanghai Hospital and Labor Hospital to sincerely persuade the workers to resume eating immediately, carrying the above-mentioned jointly signed proclamation. The hunger-striking workers, seeing that party and government agencies had issued a jointly signed proclamation, could no longer refuse and expressed acceptance. Hong Jiaben replied that he was deeply grateful for the repeated encouragement to eat from representatives of the party and government agencies and the Federation of Trade Unions. He expressed hope that the party and government agencies would continue to assist the aggrieved workers with an impartial attitude, so that the dispute could be resolved satisfactorily soon. His voice was choked with emotion. The party and government representatives were deeply moved and expressed their acceptance. They posted the proclamation in the wards and advised everyone to rest assured and await the resolution. ▲ Starting With Rice Gruel Afterwards, according to Ms. Di, a nurse at Shanghai Hospital, the hospital had repeatedly advised the workers to eat after they were admitted, but the workers firmly refused to accept. The doctor was helpless and had to forcibly pry open their mouths with a gag and pour in milk to avoid danger. However, it was inconvenient for the hospital to force-feed them given their resolute hunger strike. Now that the workers have heeded the advice and resumed eating, the hospital is quite pleased. They will start with thin gruel for dinner, as prolonged hunger strike may harm the stomach and intestines if they eat rice all of a sudden. Therefore, the hunger-striking workers have all announced that they will resume eating starting last night.</p>
<p>▲ Family Members Continue to Arrive After Hong Jiaben and others announced their hunger strike, family members who heard the news have been rushing from their hometowns to Shanghai in recent days. In addition to the families of Sun Handong and Zhu Jinsheng, who have already visited them in the hospital, the families of Qu Qifeng, Gong Yushu, You Junqing, Lu Shiying, and others arrived yesterday and went to Labor Hospital and Shanghai Hospital to visit them. They could not help but weep when they saw them. They were comforted and told that they had started eating last night, which brought them some comfort.</p>
<p>▲ Notification of Arbitration The municipal government has decided to convene all parties at 3:00 PM on the 31st to begin arbitration. The municipal government's Labor-Management Arbitration Committee has formally notified Sanyou Industrial Company and the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, requesting them to recommend representatives from the workers and prepare representative credentials to present their opinions at 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month so that a legal ruling can be made.</p>
<p>▲ Food Expenses Not Issued The workers' temporary food allowance was originally scheduled to be collected every Wednesday. The union representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Qin Haiyan, accompanied by Zhu Guilin, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, went to collect it the day before yesterday (the 24th). Wang Xianhua, the executive director of the company, replied that he would need to consult the board of directors and could issue it then. They asked them to come back on Friday to collect it. Yesterday, the union representatives Xia Zhongzhao, Gong Zishen, and Bao Boyi, again accompanied by Zhu Guilin, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, went as agreed. As Wang Xianhua was not present, a staff member replied on his behalf that they would have to wait until next Monday for a response. The union believes that the company is deliberately making things difficult and delaying payment, and that Hongtai Rice Store is urgently demanding payment for the rice. They plan to send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau again today to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>▲ Order From the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order stating: "Order Regarding Compliance: In accordance with the Municipal Government's Order No. 2283, it is stated that the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee telegraphed that the Sanyou Industrial Company has delayed reopening, the workers are on hunger strike, and the situation is dire. We urge you to use extraordinary means to force the company to reopen as soon as possible. Before the resumption of work, sufficient food must be provided to the workers. Upon receipt and verification, we also received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry stating that the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union quickly sent a letter stating that the Sanyou Company has delayed reopening. The Social Affairs Bureau has convened both parties for mediation, but the company has refused to attend. The workers have despaired, and Hong Jiaben and 23 others have voluntarily gone on hunger strike. We urge you to quickly resolve the situation. In addition to the instructions, we specifically request that the company be strictly ordered to resume work as soon as possible, and to provide the workers with food expenses to maintain their current livelihood before the resumption of work. We have approved the above. In response, the Social Affairs Bureau should immediately comply and instruct the company to provide workers with food expenses to maintain their current livelihood before the labor-management dispute is resolved, in accordance with the ministry's telegrams. Do not deviate from this order."</p>
<p>▲ Telegram From the National Products Industry The China National Products Maintenance Association, etc., sent a telegram to the Central Committee, Nanjing: "To the esteemed Executive Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, Nanjing, we have learned from the Shanghai newspapers of August 25 that your People's Movement Guidance Committee telegraphed the Shanghai Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, stating that the Sanyou Industrial Company has delayed reopening, the workers are on hunger strike, and the situation is dire. We urge you to use extraordinary means to force the company to reopen as soon as possible. Before the resumption of work, sufficient food must be provided to the workers, etc. After reading this, we were deeply alarmed. We have found that the government has already promulgated separate regulations for resolving labor-management disputes, which can be followed. In this Sanyou Industrial Company incident, which has been delayed for several months, the company has repeatedly declared the actual situation of the factory, listed the reasons for the shutdown, and submitted them to the relevant authorities, requesting them to handle the matter in accordance with the law and requesting the public organizations to assist based on reason. In addition to the government authorities instructing accountants to verify the facts, our association has also conducted a detailed investigation and knows that the company's Yinxiang Port factory cannot be restored. We hear that the municipal government has scheduled arbitration and should wait for a resolution in accordance with the law. However, your People's Movement Guidance Committee suddenly issued a telegram stating that it should use extraordinary means to force the company to reopen, which has no legal basis and is even more unreasonable. Your direct intervention in administration seems to conflict with the operational system of the party and government agencies and violates the spirit of the rule of law. If a matter already has legal provisions and can be arbitrarily decided, calling it extraordinary, it will cause those who are sincerely engaged in industry to warn each other and hold back. What prospects are there for industry? We feel deeply disturbed and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we jointly request that your committee withdraw its order to uphold the rule of law and maintain industry. Perhaps this is misinformation. We await your order in trepidation.

<h3>Verdict on the Russian Beggar Case</h3>
<p>▲Declared Not Guilty Based on Facts</p>
<p>▲Police Department Declares Appeal</p>
<p>The Russian beggar, Georgy Latygin, died of illness in the detention center of the Second Special District Court of the French Concession on June 19th of this year. The case arose from a report by the deceased's brother, Simon Grattekey, to the Police Department of the French Municipal Council, alleging that his brother had been beaten to death by a guard in the detention center. The Police Department then ordered a detailed investigation and filed a public prosecution with the Second Special Court against Xu Chongwen, the warden of the detention center, Yu Minggao, the medical officer, and Zhou Zongxiang, a guard, on charges of abandonment resulting in death and injury resulting in death under the criminal law. After a trial conducted by Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the criminal court, evidence was collected, and renowned forensic doctors from Shanghai were engaged to re-examine the body. The result determined that the deceased had indeed died of illness, clearing up the case. The debate concluded, and a verdict of not guilty was rendered for the three defendants. This matter has been reported in previous newspapers. Now that the court has served the verdict, the appeal period expired yesterday. It is understood that the Police Department is dissatisfied with the first-instance verdict and submitted a statement of appeal the day before yesterday, followed by a supplementary statement of reasons. The Second Special Court, based on the statement, is preparing to submit the entire case file to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for review. The first-instance verdict is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Full Text of the Judgment: Criminal Judgment of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, Twenty-First Year of the Republic, Jie Di Zi No. 70. Judgment against the defendants: Zhou Zongxiang, male, 36 years old, from Hubei Province, guard of this court's detention center, resident in the detention center; Xu Chongwen, male, 33 years old, from Hubei Province, warden of this court's detention center, resident on Ximen Road; Yu Minggao, male, 56 years old, from Jiangxi Province, medical officer of this court's detention center, resident on Ximen Road. The above three defendants have appointed lawyers Zhao Chen, Liu Shixiong, Li Shirui, Jiang Yiping, and Shan Yuhua as their defense counsel. The case against the above defendants for injury resulting in death and abandonment resulting in death was prosecuted by the Police Department of the French Concession in this court. The court deliberated and rendered the following judgment:</p>
<p>▲Main Text: Zhou Zongxiang, Xu Chongwen, and Yu Minggao are all not guilty. The part of Zhou Zongxiang's indictment for abandonment resulting in death is not accepted.</p>
<p>▲Reasoning: The deceased Russian inmate, Georgy Latygin, was sentenced to seven days of detention by the Criminal Summary Court of this court on June 17th of this year for being drunk, violating regulations, and extorting money. He was detained in Room 4 of this court's detention center along with Vladimir Korlovgen (i.e.,顧勞此金塊拉地愛爾) and Konstantin Gibatov (i.e.,志鮑法依勞夫公史當丁) at approximately 4:00 PM on the same day. Georgy Latygin became seriously ill and died at 11:40 AM on the 19th of the same month. The prosecutor of this court verified that the death was factual. As no family members could be found, the body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Tang for photographs and burial. Subsequently, the Police Department, based on the complaint of Simon Grattekey, the brother of Georgy Latygin, investigated and prosecuted Zhou Zongxiang, the guard of the detention center, under Article 296 of the Criminal Law, and Xu Chongwen, the warden of the detention center, and Yu Minggao, the medical officer, under Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. According to the indictment, the indictment should be in writing and contain the following items: (1) Omitted; (2) Facts of the crime, reasons for the indictment, and the articles of law violated. This is clearly stipulated in Article 258, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The case file sent by the Police Department and its statement of the main points of the indictment both recognize that the defendant Zhou Zongxiang had the fact of injuring Georgy Latygin, resulting in death, and prosecuted him under Article 296 of the Criminal Law. However, after this court completed the investigation of evidence and ordered the debate to proceed, it suddenly verbally changed the indictment against the defendant Zhou Zongxiang to Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. This indictment is not in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations and cannot be accepted. Furthermore, the court's determination of the facts of the crime should be based on evidence. This is a major principle of procedural law. The Police Department's determination of the facts of the crimes of the defendants and the testimony of Vladimir Korlovgen, Konstantin Gibatov, and Kreskov, who were detained at the same time, should be considered as to whether the testimony of these witnesses can be adopted. It should be judged whether the testimony has reliable probative value. The parts of each defendant's indictment are explained separately below: (1)</p>
<p>▲Zhou Zongxiang's part: According to Simon Grattekey's statement in this court, "I heard from Kreskov, a person detained with my brother, that my brother was beaten to death by a prison guard." However, when questioned, Kreskov stated, "I did not see anyone beating him when I was in the detention center. When he entered the detention center, I saw blood on his nose." Thus, Kreskov told Simon Grattekey that he was beaten by a prison guard, and when questioned by this court, he said that he did not see anyone beating him in the detention center. It can be seen that his testimony is not credible. In order to discover the truth, this court conducted an on-site inspection during the trial. The forensic doctors of this court, together with the separately hired physician Smith Wileo, dissected and examined the body of Georgy Latygin to see if there were any injuries and to determine the cause of death. The report concluded that there were no injuries to the bones except for a possible fracture of the nose during his lifetime, and the exact cause of death could not be clearly found. Georgy Latygin has been proven to have no fatal injuries, and there is no other evidence to prove it, so the defendant Zhou Zongxiang is not responsible for the crime under Article 296 of the Criminal Law. (2)</p>
<p>▲Xu Chongwen and Yu Minggao's part: According to Article 310 of the Criminal Law, it is a necessary element of the crime to abandon a person without the ability to save themselves who is legally or contractually obligated to assist, nurture, and protect, or to fail to provide the assistance, nurture, and protection necessary for their survival. Furthermore, the crime under this article requires intent, whether it is active abandonment or passive failure to provide the assistance, nurture, and protection necessary for survival. It cannot be determined solely by the result. Although the defendant Xu Chongwen is the warden of the detention center, he is only responsible for directing and supervising the treatment of prisoners. Examining the files of this case in the detention center, on June 17th, the defendant ordered the medical officer Yu Minggao to properly treat Georgy Latygin's illness according to the report of the duty officer Xu Shunian. There is a written approval that can be verified. When he became seriously ill at 10:00 AM on June 19th, he urgently summoned the doctor Yu Minggao for treatment. This fact has been confessed by the defendant Yu Minggao, who stated that he was ordered by the warden to treat the Russian inmate. Although the defendant Xu Chongwen is legally obligated to assist, nurture, and protect Georgy Latygin, he immediately ordered the medical officer to treat him upon receiving the report, and it is obvious that he had no intention of abandoning him. According to the defendant Yu Minggao, he was ordered to treat Georgy Latygin's illness on June 17th and entered the detention center at 5:00 PM. At that time, the deceased was lying on the ground. I stood outside the railing, bent over, and reached in to see him and asked about his illness with some colleagues. I saw that his illness was a cold, and his pulse showed signs of chills and fever, so I treated him with 'relief water.' This illness can be cured by drinking 'relief water.' At around 11:00 AM on the 18th, the guard reported that the Russian was getting better, so I went to see him again and gave him 'Li Luan Ping An San' to eat. I went to see him again at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. At 10:00 AM on the 19th, the warden ordered someone to call me and said that the Russian was seriously ill. When I went inside, I saw that he was sweating profusely and had already become dehydrated. I immediately reported to the warden to send him to the hospital, but it was too late. As for the medicine, I wrote a note and gave it to the person in charge of the medicine." This is consistent with the statement of Cao Jianhou, the Russian translator of the detention center, who said that he went to ask about the Russian's illness with the doctor at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, and the statement of Li Dianzhong, the director of the medicine department, who said that he delivered 'relief water' and 'Li Luan Ping An San' on the 17th and 18th, and presented the note issued by the defendant for taking the medicine, and the situation described by the defendant Zhou Zongxiang regarding the diagnosis of the illness, which can still be consistent. The Russian Kreskov, Vladimir Korlovgen, and Konstantin Gibatov unanimously testified that they did not see a doctor diagnosing or treating Georgy Latygin from the time he entered the detention center until his death, which is difficult to believe. When asked whether Georgy Latygin drank water in the detention center, the witnesses all said that he did drink water, proving the defendant Zhou Zongxiang's statement that "I used hot water to brew 'relief water' and 'Ping An San' for him (referring to the deceased) to eat," which is sufficient to prove that Georgy Latygin did drink the medicine, so the statement of Kreskov and others that he did not take the medicine is also not credible. Regarding the determination of the disease, the defendant Yu Minggao said that his pulse was deep, which means he suffered from a cold. There are no germs in the cold, so it is not contagious. The report of the physician's examination of Georgy Latygin's pants also clearly states that the accumulated dirt was examined under a microscope, and no dysentery bacteria were found, which shows that the defendant's claim that it was not a contagious disease is not an empty statement. The defendant Yu Minggao entered the detention center three times on the 17th and 18th after being ordered to treat him and used two kinds of medicine to treat him, which should be considered to have fulfilled the obligation of considerable protection, and there is no doubt that he is not responsible for the crime under Article 310 of the Criminal Law. Based on the above,</p>
<p>▲Conclusion: According to Article 316 and Article 318, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as in the main text. If you are not satisfied with this judgment, you may appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court from the day after the judgment is served within ten days. August 11th, Twenty-First Year of the Republic of China, Wang Gangxu, Judge of the Criminal Court of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court (seal). This document is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Zhu Chengchuo (seal)</p>
<h3>Export of Ham and Eggs to Be Hit</h3>
<p>▲Philippine Government to Increase Taxes Again</p>
<p>▲Our Consul General Asks for Negotiations</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, stating, "Dear Sirs, We have approved the official letter No. 1728 from our Consulate General in Manila, which states, 'The Philippines has been affected by the global recession in recent years, and commerce has been declining. The losses suffered by overseas Chinese are particularly severe. Stores are closing down from time to time, and the Philippine government is constantly issuing harsh regulations and collecting multiple taxes, with the intention of curbing the development of foreign businesses in order to protect local products and manufactures and assist the economic independence of Filipinos. The tax division of the legislature is currently drafting a proposal to increase the import tax on eggs, ham, and other goods. Most of these items come from our country, and the proposed tax rates range from several times to twenty times the current rates. It is rumored that these plans were instructed by Mr. Roosevelt of the Philippines, so it is likely to be passed in the future. If it is implemented, these major commodities from our country will likely disappear from the Philippines. Our consulate and overseas Chinese businesses are considering protest measures. In addition to paying attention to and reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry at any time, we are sending a summary for your reference and requesting that you unite with various producing merchants and factories to publicize the issue as much as possible in order to achieve the goal of canceling the tax increase. We appreciate your friendship.' Enclosed is a summary, which has been received by the bureau. Accordingly, we are sending a copy of the summary to your association, hoping that you will investigate and forward it to all exporters in the industry to pay attention to, find ways to prevent tax increases, and benefit our country's foreign trade. We appreciate your friendship." The summary is as follows: "The eggs, ham, lard, and other foods sold in the Philippines mostly come from our country. According to the customs statistics of Sino-Philippine trade each year, the above items should account for the majority of our country's exports to the Philippines. The values of eggs, ham, sausages, and lard transported from China to the Philippines in 1930 and 1931, and the total amount of customs duties levied, are listed below. (All are calculated in Philippine currency, 元, which is the Philippine Peso, Peso, with two Pesos equivalent to one US dollar.)"</p>
<p>Eggs Ham</p>
<p>1930 Value of Goods Customs Duties 1,983,134 yuan 408,200 yuan</p>
<p>109,595 yuan 35,156 yuan</p>
<p>Sausages Lard</p>
<p>1930 Value of Goods Customs Duties 83,167 yuan 773,309 yuan</p>
<p>7,764 yuan 106,157 yuan</p>
<p>Eggs Ham</p>
<p>1931 Value of Goods Customs Duties 2,102,209 yuan 498,164 yuan</p>
<p>171,01 yuan 51,846 yuan</p>
<p>Sausages Lard</p>
<p>1931 Value of Goods 91,200 yuan 795,492 yuan</p>
<p>Customs Duties 8,664 yuan 147,622 yuan</p>
<p>"According to the table above, it can be seen that the value of eggs, ham, and other items transported from our country to the Philippines each year has reached a huge sum of 4 million yuan. If other meats are included, the authorities will certainly exceed this amount. The Philippine government, in order to protect local products and manufactures, and to block this loophole, has repeatedly sought ways to prevent it. Therefore, last year, there was a proposal in the House of Representatives to increase the import tax on eggs, ham, and other items. The highest increase rate, such as for eggs, was more than 17 times the tax on raw materials, or 1,775%. Overseas Chinese businessmen engaged in these commodities rose up to campaign and dispel this proposal. At that time, most members of the legislature also believed that increasing the import tax would not benefit the government or the people in practice, and it failed to pass, and the case was shelved. In recent years, the Philippines has suffered from the global recession and the decline in the price of local products, and the people are in difficulty, and the government's economy is also strained. Since the new Governor Roosevelt took office, his important policy has been to balance the government's revenue and expenditure. To balance revenue and expenditure, it is necessary to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Therefore, the salaries of government staff, from the governor to the staff of various affiliated agencies, have been greatly reduced. On the revenue side, various taxes are being increased separately. The tax division of the legislature has revived the old proposal and is drafting an increase in the population tax rates for eggs, ham, and other items. It is rumored that the commission will increase the tax on ham and sausages from the original 9 yuan per 100 kilograms to 20 yuan, and increase the tax on lard from the original 5 yuan per 100 kilograms by four to twenty times, to 20 yuan. The tax on chicken and duck eggs, which was originally 2 yuan per 100 kilograms (about 2,000 eggs), will be changed to 2 yuan per 100 eggs. The high increase rate is truly astonishing. It is rumored that this plan was instructed by Governor Roosevelt. Since the United States governs the Philippines with a military nature, the governor's power is even greater than that of the American president's governance of the United States. Therefore, this tax increase problem, which has been previously discussed and is now instructed by the Philippine governor, is likely to be passed. Once it is passed by the legislature, the governor's approval is inevitable. The autonomy of customs duties is a common practice in the world, and the Philippine government's increase in customs duties is within its sovereignty, and foreign businesses are not allowed to interfere. However, at a time when overseas Chinese businesses are declining, once taxes are increased, not only will the overseas Chinese businesses engaged in eggs and other items be exploited by heavy taxes and go bankrupt, but this major foreign trade of our country will also be reduced due to restrictions. Therefore, we have to find ways to eliminate this plan of the Philippine authorities to increase taxes. The purpose of increasing taxes is nothing more than to increase government revenue and protect domestic products. However, the Philippine Islands' production of eggs is less than one-third of the island's demand, ham is less than one-twentieth, and lard is only available in small quantities as coconut oil substitutes. Although there are two sausage factories, they are set up by foreign businesses. It is clear that the items must be supplied from foreign countries. Referring to the previous table, the Philippine government's tax on these items each year reaches a huge sum of 250,000 to 300,000 yuan. If the business statistics of the commercial resale are also included, the annual amount should be between 500,000 and 600,000 yuan. Once the tax increase is implemented, the number of rounds will be sharply reduced, and the market price will inevitably be expensive. The government's revenue will not only not increase, but may also decrease because of it. What is the need to increase the burden on the people? What is the result of increasing revenue? What is the need to protect local products? Since this draft is still in the planning stage, protests have no basis, and shelving it will leave difficulties for future negotiations. An effective method seems to be to work hard to publicize the above reasons, and to contact and lobby the members of the Philippine legislature to make it clear that this policy is of no benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and to cancel the plan. More recently, Japan had a plan to increase the import tax on Philippine wood. Wood is one of the major products of the Philippines, and it is now working hard on overseas sales due to overproduction. If Japan increases the import tax rate, it will be greatly affected. Therefore, the Philippine government and various timber merchants unanimously declared that if Japan implements an increase in the tax rate on Philippine wood, the Philippine government will levy heavy taxes on Japanese goods to retaliate. Japan's trade with the Philippines has always been in surplus. As expected, Japan was concerned and finally canceled the proposal. This method, whether it is a publicity effect or a preparation for implementation, should be regarded as an expression that a country with autonomous customs duties should have, and a possible countermeasure based on the principle of reciprocity. The Philippine Islands' native products such as tobacco, sugar, wood, ramie, coconut, etc., have a huge amount of exports to our country every year. If our country adopts this method, it will definitely receive considerable results. In addition to the consulate and overseas Chinese businesses, the former method also requires relevant domestic merchants and international trade organizations to express their opinions and criticize the tax increase. The latter method is hoped that our government will adopt and promote it in unison with domestic and foreign merchants, so that the Philippine government will be concerned and stop the proposal. The overseas Chinese businesses are fortunate, and our country's international trade is fortunate."</p>
<h3>Public Bus Strike Committee Asks Yu Qiaqing et al. for Assistance</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that the public bus workers' strike of the British company, since its implementation, has been deadlocked for sixteen days due to the strong attitude of the capital side and has not been resolved. The labor side decided today to send a letter to Yu Qiaqing et al. for assistance, as follows:</p>
<p>▲Letter Asking for Mediation: The strike committee believes that the storm has been delayed and unresolved, and the workers' lives are very difficult. It decided to send a letter to prominent business figures Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaotie, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, requesting them to serve as mediators. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, Under the oppression of imperialist capitalists, workers have been forcibly dismissed without regard for public morality, which is most severe. Although various parties have served as mediators, the company's attitude is tough and it firmly refuses to accept the workers' demands. We have long admired your reputation as leaders in the business community, trusted both at home and abroad. We earnestly request that you have compassion for the workers who have no means of livelihood and agree to serve as mediators to maintain people's livelihood."</p>
<p>▲Negotiations with Passengers: Since the public bus strike occurred, the buses on various routes have repeatedly been targeted by striking workers with thrown stones, feces, sewage, and other incidents. Many innocent passengers have been wronged. Some people have negotiated with the company but were rejected. Therefore, yesterday, Li Qiuting, Wang Jinshou, and others went to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, asking them to forward a letter to the Public Works Department to negotiate with the company for compensation. Mr. Tao Leqin of the association received them and agreed to handle the negotiations with the Public Works Department immediately.</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government's Inquiry: The Municipal Government summoned labor representatives yesterday to clarify the situation of the public bus strike. Two representatives were sent by the strike committee. Secretary Zhang Tingrong received them and asked in detail about the strike situation and the company's attitude.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Hosts Leaders from All Industries</h3>
<p>▲Explaining the Advantages of the Responsible Transportation System</p>
<p>In order to improve the transportation of goods on various railways, the Ministry of Railways issued a general order to all railways to adopt a responsible transportation system. However, transportation colleagues, due to a lack of understanding of the truth of the system, gathered to discuss opposition, and the business community and public organizations also opposed it. Therefore, the Ministry specially hosted leaders from all industries in both Beijing and Shanghai to explain the advantages of the system and the benefits obtained by transportation merchants. The Beijing meeting was held on the 26th, and the Shanghai meeting is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 28th) at the Bankers' Association. Relevant groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are all on the list of invitees.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Special Telegram to Oppose Priority Shipping System</h3>
<p>▲Revealing the Shortcomings of the General Rules for Freight Car Transportation</p>
<p>▲Seeking a Public Meeting of All Sectors for Discussion</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Railways yesterday, requesting to amend the General Rules for Freight Car Transportation. The original text stated, "We received a letter from the Municipal Transportation Association on the 25th of this month, stating, 'We previously received an order from the Railway Bureau forwarded by the Ministry of Railways, stating, "The General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars of the Republic of China are hereby promulgated." The order, etc., apart from distribution, is hereby ordered to inform the subordinate departments, etc. The colleagues of our association have held a meeting and collected opinions from merchants, and they all believe that the railway is a national transportation enterprise. At this time when the war has just ended and people's lives are declining, transportation prices should be reduced to facilitate commerce and the people. Now that the Ministry's order to formulate the General Rules is received, and it is scheduled to be implemented on September 1st, the colleagues of our association have read the articles of the General Rules in detail and found that there are indeed obstacles that are difficult to implement. Therefore, we have cited the more serious harms and added comments. In addition to petitioning the Ministry of Railways to withdraw the order, we hereby request your association to forward the situation to the Ministry of Railways and temporarily suspend implementation, and to consult with the various trade associations to strive for the purpose of withdrawing the order to alleviate the suffering of merchants and benefit transportation, etc.' An opinion book was attached to the meeting. It was found that within the scope of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, waterways are accessible. Waterways are fully responsible for the transportation of passengers and goods and do not charge additional fees. Since the National Commercial Transportation Conference was held by the two railways in March of last year, the freight has been increased by 20%. Now, under the pretext of responsible transportation, the freight will be increased by another 10%, and the restrictions of Item 19 of Article 36 will be invoked, which is nothing more than to relieve responsibility. After the event, claims will be rejected as much as possible, only increasing the cost for transportation merchants. At the same time, the system of priority shipping and most priority shipping is also created. According to the responsible freight, another 30% and 60% will be charged. This example is opened by a public cause and uses a business nature with unusual policies, with the use of limited vehicles, there is high price competition and passengers paying for normal freight will not know when goods will arrive. If not, it forces a flat rate with a report of pre shipment being necessary, despite the clever method of price increase, this core mission goes against the aim of ease. It is thought that the railways are a monopolized business and are the nature of business, regarding transport matters, Merchants should be given the opportunity to listen to and agree to and participate in prior discussions, and its rules must not contradict the principles of civil law. The Office of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways previously received the opportunity to make the contents of responsible transportation clear, and the suggestion to choose a place to meet this month is to take advantage of this opportunity and allow each of the contents of the general rules to be discussed publicly. If there are any inconveniences, permission may be granted to make amendments or postpone the implementation of the General Rule in order to meet the aim to benefit the general public. We request that the Ministry's Nuclear Department review and approve the request for public convenience. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Thoroughly Investigates Manipulation of National Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Requests Yarn Firms Association, etc., to Halt It</p>
<p>▲ Entire Stock Bought Up by Petty Merchants for Profiteering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to thoroughly investigate the manipulation of national yarn prices, sent letters separately to the Yarn Firms Association and the Shenxin Cotton Mill, stating: On the 25th of this month, the Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association sent a letter stating that at a time when anti-Japanese sentiment among the city's residents is extremely high, the Yifeng Yarn Firm in Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, saw it as an excellent opportunity for profit and colluded with a Mr. Mao of the Shenxin Cotton Mill's sales department, offering him 20% of the profits. Using the name Yuanfeng Yarn Firm, they bought up all 2,800 bales of Shenxin's existing stock and, breaking with precedent, paid 28,000 taels</p>
<p>as a deposit. That day, no bales of 42-count yarn from Shenxin were released on the market, and the Yifeng Yarn Firm arbitrarily raised prices, engaging in unscrupulous profiteering. The association members were extremely indignant, and those in the yarn industry also expressed deep sympathy, requesting that higher authorities severely punish them as a warning to others, and asking that the matter be forwarded for handling. If this is true, then the Yifeng Yarn Firm and Mr. Mao of Shenxin are acting selfishly, no different from traitors, and should be severely punished as a deterrent. We are sending this letter to you for your investigation and handling. Accordingly, we find that at a time when the city is experiencing a tense anti-Japanese goods movement, it is inexcusable for unpatriotic merchants to secretly sell inferior goods, and it is also reprehensible to take advantage of the situation to monopolize the price of national goods and manipulate the market. Now, the Yifeng Yarn Firm has colluded with an employee of the Shenxin Cotton Mill to buy up a large quantity of 42-count fine yarn at a high deposit, with the intention of raising prices for resale, seeking profit at the expense of public sentiment. It is no wonder that the industry is outraged and wants to take action. We hereby request that your association and factory quickly investigate and strictly prohibit this, ensuring that national yarn is sold smoothly and not hindered. Your prompt reply is essential.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Responds to Public Security Bureau Regarding Murder Case in Lizhong Lane</h3>
<p>▲ Suspects are Currently Under Trial and Investigation</p>
<p>Regarding the case of an Indian policeman in the Lijzhong Lane on the Feihong Road in Hongkou, who killed Zhou A Yu with a stamp, Wen Yingxing, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, sent a letter to the British Consul-General requesting punishment of the murderer, compensation, and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future.

<h3>Report on Hospitals and Nursing Affairs by the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Report of the Committee on Hospitals and Nursing Affairs: The Committee on Hospitals and Nursing Affairs, organized by the Public Works Department, began its work in July 1930. It was initially chaired by Dr. D.E.</p>
<p>L. Mash, and after Mr. Ma returned to his country, Dr. Ed. Birt continued to preside over the investigation. The participating organizations included the Health Committee of the Public Works Department, the Bo Medical Association, the Chinese Medical Association, the German Medical Society, church hospitals, the Japanese Medical Society, the Shanghai Women's Association, the American Medical Association, Chinese hospitals, etc., as well as the Director of Health of the Public Works Department. The investigation committee was divided into groups to conduct research, including groups for isolation hospitals, general hospitals, obstetrics, mental hospitals, and nursing. The committee, entrusted by the Public Works Department, has completed its investigation and prepared a report. The report has been approved in principle by the Public Works Department, but the proposed entertainment tax is still under consideration. The various recommendations in the report are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Isolation Hospitals (Including Tuberculosis) (1) The Chinese Isolation Hospital should be moved to the current Western Isolation Hospital and renamed the Northern District Fever Hospital. Most of this hospital should be for the needs of poorer Chinese people, but a small part should be equipped with first-class rooms and a few rooms should be reserved for Japanese patients. (2) A new hospital should be built on the "Island Site" on West Jing'an Temple Road and named the Western District Fever Hospital, for the use of people of all nationalities, with approximately 160 beds, equipped for both mild and severe infectious diseases. In addition to paying patients, a number of free beds should be provided. (3) The Northern District Fever Hospital should add some very simple row of wards as soon as possible, with a capacity of about 100 to 150 beds, for use in case of an epidemic. As for the equipment for tuberculosis, the problem is too large, and it seems that it cannot be solved without the cooperation of the three municipal authorities or the cooperation of the Chinese government. It seems difficult for the Public Concession to take on the responsibility of building a large sanatorium alone. However, if possible, the committee advocates building a sanatorium with a capacity of 200 beds, limited to genuine residents, and encouraging private sanatoriums and providing subsidies to them, regardless of whether they are located within the concession or not.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Mental Hospitals, the committee believes that municipal authorities should provide facilities for such patients, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality. Apart from infectious diseases, this is actually the most important thing, and at present, there are no facilities for Chinese patients, and there is also a great shortage for foreign patients. Therefore, the construction (2) should construct a new mental hospital, with 100 to 150 beds, first for the needs of serious cases. The design of the hospital should reserve the convenience of doubling the expansion in the future. (2) It is more convenient to manage Chinese and foreign patients with one hospital, but separate units can be set up separately. (3) An expert should be consulted for the start of the plan and future management, and a training school should be set up first for the training of staff. (4) Regarding those who are not easily cured, (A) if they are</p>
<p>foreigners, they should be sent back to their country. (B) In the future, it should unite with the other two municipal government agencies to set up a shelter, and ask for private charitable assistance. (C) According to British and American customs, this type of patient should be taken care of by the state, but it seems inconvenient to raise this issue with the Chinese government at this time.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Obstetric Facilities, the committee advocates setting up an obstetric center in the northern district, with a training institute attached. (1) Equipment item 7</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Below, (A) establish an obstetrics hospital with twenty beds (reserve land for expansion) or attach a number of paid beds. (B) Attach a prenatal and postnatal nursery. (C) Equip a number of portable honorariums for use by midwifery doctors. (2) Under the staff item, (A) set up a resident doctor to supervise medical treatment and serious illnesses, guide childcare and delivery, and add a doctor when necessary. (B) Set up a foreign female supervisor who should be a trained midwifery doctor to supervise and teach. (C) Set up six foreign trained midwifery doctors, two in the hospital and four providing outreach services and teaching, and may be added when necessary. (D) Set up at least six Chinese midwifery doctors, and add more when necessary if there are qualified candidates. (E) Set up an obstetrics training class for lectures and external internships. (F) For students in the training class who are not adequately assigned, recruit nurses to provide services in the hospital and at home. (G) Hire a number of volunteer doctors as honorary staff for consultations and lectures.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding General Hospitals, etc., the committee recommends building a charity hospital in the British style that can accommodate 500 people, limited to residents of the concession suffering from chronic and incurable diseases. One floor of this hospital should be set aside for obstetrics needs, and an obstetrics nursing department should be established. The lower level of this hospital should be equipped for school diagnosis and treatment, and facilities for the well-being of mothers and children. A venereal disease treatment committee has drawn up a drawing for the construction of this hospital and has considered its location. Regarding hospital subsidies, the committee recommends that the Public Works Department set up a standing committee for consultation and to investigate whether the hospitals receiving subsidies are competent for the affairs for which they are requesting subsidies. Furthermore, hospitals that do not meet the minimum registration requirements should not be subsidized. Although the Hospital Registration Committee feels that it is difficult to enforce registration at present, it believes that compulsory registration is indeed necessary. For the time being, a voluntary registration method has been drafted and can be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding Nursing Affairs, the committee recommends establishing a nursing training school that accepts qualified people of all nationalities. The training period is four years, including all nursing and midwifery courses, and a midwifery training class should be set up specifically for Chinese nursing graduates. In conclusion, it is said that the committee attaches the most importance to the medical responsibilities that municipal authorities should fulfill: (1) to equip and supervise isolation hospitals for infectious and serious diseases; (2) to monitor the health of children in schools; (3) to prepare medical facilities for patients and injured people in the city, especially venereal diseases and tuberculosis, which are increasingly valued by the municipality and the government; (4) to provide care for poor mothers and children; (5) to provide facilities for mental illness, the responsibility for which is now mostly undertaken by the central government in various countries. The existing hospitals in the concession are sufficient for the rich, but there is a lack for the poor classes, and the equipment is not sufficient due to long-term incurable diseases and patients from outside the concession seeking medical treatment. Therefore, the committee advocates building a charity hospital, and expanding its branches in the future, which can be promoted from the existing health sub-offices. As for the prevention of diseases, as well as the care of mothers and children, they are the foundation of the health of the whole city. According to the committee, the Public Works Department should decide on a policy as soon as possible and make appropriate equipment for the needs of the concession. As for outside the concession, it is necessary to contact and cooperate with other municipal government agencies, especially for the two social problems of tuberculosis and nervous diseases, which cannot be solved without cooperation.</p>
<p>▲ Recommendations for Raising Funds The committee has fulfilled its investigation duties.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department will decide on the methods of implementation. However, some fundraising possibilities that have been implemented in other countries may also be mentioned, such as holding "Hospital Sunday" and other gatherings in order to raise donations. Also, the report of the Thrift Committee previously sent by the Public Works Department (see Public Bulletin Volume 22, Issue 1174) suggested levying an "entertainment tax." If this tax is used exclusively for hospitals, it will be easier to obtain public support. There are currently 23 cinemas in the concession, with 18,800 seats, and 3 larger Chinese theaters, with 7,186 seats. In addition, some hotels and other places also show movies, and there are also a number of dance halls. Assuming that those with seat prices of one yuan or more are Class A, and those less than one yuan are Class B, it is estimated that the maximum daily income from movies and theaters is approximately 25,900 yuan, which is 11,096,000 yuan per year. If Class A is taxed at 10% and Class B at 5% according to the total number of seats, approximately 940,000 yuan can be obtained annually. If Class A is taxed at 20% and Class B at 10% according to the actual number of tickets sold, approximately 1,270,000 yuan can be obtained annually. Although the second method can collect more, the procedures are complicated, so it is better to adopt the first method. If the donation method is extended to hotels and dance halls that hold movies and entertainment, the amount collected can be increased by about a quarter. Regardless of any unexpected losses, it is estimated that 750,000 yuan can be collected annually. According to the committee's proposal, with this 750,000 yuan, the operating expenses of various businesses can be covered. With the operating expenses guaranteed, the investment in starting a business can be planned more easily.</p>
<h3>Lin Hua, Who Falsely Claimed Official Position, Escorted to Beijing</h3>

Director Wen has now sent personnel to escort Lin on the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Beijing for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Police Department Presents Silver Shield to Liu Cao Shi</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, a case of a concubine being brutally murdered by her lover occurred in the rear building of Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 825, Dengtuo Road, Xihua De Road, in this port. The details have been fully reported in this newspaper. However, the murderer, Pu Henian, was immediately arrested without escaping, thanks to the alertness and composure of the second landlord, Liu Caoshi. This case has now been sentenced by the court, and the murderer, Pu Henian, has been sentenced to life imprisonment. At the same time, Gerald, the Inspector General of the Public Concession Police Department, believed that Liu Caoshi's courage and righteousness were commendable, so he specially prepared a silver shield with the inscription "Commendable Intelligence and Bravery" to present to her in order to express his gratitude and encourage her. The award ceremony was held at the Huishan Police Station at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Inspector General Jia specially appointed D District Chief Pike to represent the award, and Chinese Inspector Wu Genyuan served as the interpreter. After receiving the award, Liu Caoshi thanked the audience and left. The onlookers were very crowded at the time.</p>
<h3>Five Associations in the Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Telegraphically Request Clarification of License Issues</h3>
<p>The various tobacco and alcohol associations in this city, regarding the sudden increase in the amount of license tax in Shangbao County this year and the eligibility of the director of the selection committee, sent telegrams to the department and bureau, requesting clarification. The original text is as follows: Xie, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Jiang and Liang, Directors of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol: Since Shangbao and other counties suffered from the war, most of the shops have closed down. Although transportation has recovered, business is still slack. I read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Finance approved your bureau to refer to the past disbursement items and determine the category as 77,620 yuan, and a person named Wang Yao recognized the increase to 90,120 yuan, which is more than 20% higher than the 20th year. Merchants and people were shocked when they heard the news. Since the tobacco and alcohol license tax was changed to four seasons in the 17th year, the amount has increased year by year, and the merchants and people have been suffering. For the amount of tax payable by the tobacco and alcohol industries this year, the associations are preparing to request a reduction in order to relieve the merchants. However, the contractors are arbitrarily increasing the amount for the purpose of profit. Whether this increase will increase the burden on the merchants in the tobacco and alcohol industries when it is formally collected in the future is a question. Moreover, according to Article 2 of the Selection Committee Rules, the candidates for the head of the tax collection sub-bureau should have one of the following qualifications: (A) being a tobacco and alcohol merchant; (B) having been a tax collector of tobacco and alcohol fees and having made achievements. The assessment is strict and the review should be more clear. However, Wang Yao, the current head of the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Sub-Bureau, cannot be found among the tobacco and alcohol merchants. It is undoubtedly clear that he does not meet the qualifications of item A. If it is said that he meets the qualifications of item B, then where has he been a tax collector and whether he has made achievements, the tobacco and alcohol merchants are full of doubts and cannot be explained. We should ask your department to order the two directors of the bureau, Jiang and Liang, to explain clearly in order to show justice. The merchants in Shangbao and other counties who survived the war cannot bear the exploitation. Financial managers should rectify to open up tax sources, and tax collectors should also consider the situation to relieve merchants. Otherwise, disputes will occur, which will not benefit either tax or merchants. The association representatives are concerned and dare not remain silent. We hereby telegraphically report in the name of the association. We have always admired your integrity and fairness, and you will surely correct this case. The telegram is urgent, and we are waiting for instructions. Huang Yuming, Shanghai Liang Baijiu Industry Association; Fang Zhongheng, Tu Huang Baijiu Industry Association; Zhang Dalian, Jiang Jiuhao Industry Association; Chen Weiwen, Jiangyuan Industry Association; Chen Liangyu, Yandui Industry Association.

<h3>Zhu Kaichou Benefits Farmers</h3>
<p>This year, Taicang, Baoshan, Jiading, and other counties have suffered from a lack of rain and the drying up of rivers, and the farmland has no way to be irrigated, and disasters are about to occur. Zhu Kaichou, a gentry in Liuhe Town, Taicang, in view of this, specially invested 2,500 yuan to purchase three water pumps and transport them to Liuhe, which are distributed to farmers in the second, third, and fourth districts for application. First, the water from the big river is diverted into the river, and then poured into the farmland. It is estimated that three-eighths of the farmland in Taicang County, about more than 100,000 mu, are free from the danger of water shortage, all thanks to Mr. Zhu.

<h3>Japanese Trading Company's Traveling Salesman Illegally Pawns Imported Fountain Pens and is Fined</h3>
<p>▲ Lu Dafeng Sentenced to One Year in Prison</p>
<p>Lu Dafeng, a native of Suzhou, residing at No. 61, Ruifuli, near the Great World in the French Concession, worked as a traveling salesman for the Jiangnan Trading Company established by Japanese national Komida at No. 80, Peng Road. On the 20th of this month at 10:00 AM, he was ordered by the Japanese to deliver eleven dozen and nine Safety brand fountain pens, valued at 282 yuan, to Xue Xin Stationery Store at No. 123, Jiaotong Road, which had ordered them. However, Lu secretly pawned three dozen of the fountain pens at Fu Da on Guangxi Road (No. 199) and Hengxiang on Guangdong Road (No. 422), obtaining 16.3 yuan which he spent. He did not report to the trading company for two days. The Japanese national Komida inquired at the Xue Xin Stationery Store on Jiaotong Road, only to be told that the goods had not been received. On the afternoon of the 23rd at 2:00 PM, Lu sent his brother to report to Komida at the trading company, claiming that the fountain pens had been taken by the "Blood Soul Extermination Corps." However, Komida's investigation revealed this to be false. He reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detective Zhang Guisheng who discovered Lu Dafeng hiding in the Haitongchun Hotel at No. 15, Guangxi Road. Lu was arrested, and eight dozen and nine fountain pens were recovered. The three dozen pawned items were also retrieved from the pawnshops and brought to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, presented the facts of the case and requested prosecution. The stolen goods were presented for inspection. Subsequently, Japanese national Komida gave a statement. Lu Dafeng confessed that the Japanese national owed him wages. At the time, the plaintiff instructed him to deliver eleven dozen and nine fountain pens to the Xue Xin Stationery Store on Jiaotong Road, requiring him to bring back cash. The store owner only agreed to provide promissory notes, so he had no money for personal use and pawned three dozen pens, which was true. Judge Zhou reviewed the confession and sentenced Lu Dafeng to one year of imprisonment, with the stolen goods to be returned.</p>
<h3>Infant Corpse with Head Discovered on Xinzha Road</h3>

<h3>The Efficacy of Shi Li Brand Beef and Chicken Extract</h3>
<p>The Shi Li Brand beef and chicken extract, managed by the Shanghai Huada Pharmacy and manufactured by the German Malda Pharmaceutical Factory using cold pressing, has tremendous effectiveness. Shi Li Brand beef and chicken extract have been sold in China for a long time, not only having unparalleled restorative power but also being suitable for all seasons, having the effect of preventing epidemics. Now that the autumn wind is just beginning, dysentery sufferers are emerging. If one can purchase and take it in advance, it can be eliminated invisibly. Even if one has unfortunately already contracted it, it is even more necessary to purchase and take it after recovery, which can immediately restore one's usual health. There are many goods arriving this year, and the supply can meet the demand. However, one must pay attention to the three characters "Shi Li Brand". Anything with only the character "Shi" is certainly not it, and anything with only the character "Li" is also not it. One must recognize the three characters "Shi Li Brand" together to be the genuine German product. Department stores and major pharmacies and major food stores in the city and other places all sell it.</p>

It was resolved to immediately prepare to organize a committee, and the number of members and the list would be discussed and approved at the next meeting. (3) It was resolved to set the date for the next meeting for 1:00 PM on Monday of next week. (4) The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers Union. Since the British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong promulgated management rules, it has aroused opposition from all workers. The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers Union had previously submitted a request to the party and government agencies to amend them. At 6:00 PM yesterday, the association specially convened an emergency representative meeting to discuss the matter. More than 100 representatives attended. Zhong Quan, a representative from the municipal party department, and Tan Peiyan, a representative from the social bureau, attended to provide guidance. The presidium consisted of Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, Gu Ruofeng, and the recorder Sun Xiaozhu. After the meeting was conducted as usual, the chairman first reported that the factory had promulgated management rules. After reviewing the content, it was found that it not only conflicted with labor-management conditions in many ways but also favored the interests of the capital side. All the factory's legal benefits were included, but the factory's management rights could not be unified. The Westerners in each factory often acted arbitrarily, so all the workers could not accept it. Based on the resolution of the previous representative meeting, the association had sent a letter to the factory, requesting that it temporarily postpone the implementation of the management rules until the higher authorities amended them. After the chairman reported, the discussion began on organizing a committee to amend labor-management mutual assistance conditions. Chen Peide, Gu Ruofeng, Liu Dehua, Xiao Gengsheng, Zhang Yuping, Dong Aosheng, Li Yuanfu, Pan Quanrong, Ren Kunda, Chen Shaoqing, Xia Su'e, Lu Longbao, Wang Zhaoliang, Chen Yixing, Li Laifa, Tao Zhenglong, Ren Zhenxiang, Wang Amao, and Xu Wenqing were nominated as members of the amending committee. Subsequently, representatives from the city and the social bureau provided guidance (lengthy speeches omitted).</p>
<p>▲ Fifth District Match Industry Workers Union held a general election of representatives yesterday. Chen Songyao was publicly elected as chairman. The ceremony was conducted as usual, and he reported on the association's situation and financial status. Chen Songyao, Yu Zhaofu, Shen Jusheng, Chen Songqiu, Shen A'ming, Feng Zhufu, Lao Hefu, Yang Xiaomao, and Wang Lansheng were elected as directors, and Feng Fulin, He Guitang, Zhu Guirong, Yu Aqi, etc., were elected as alternate directors. Sha Jinlin, Xu Liangshan, Hu Afa, Hu Xingxing, and Zhao Liancheng, etc., were elected as supervisors, and Chen Yongsheng and Zhu Bingyao, etc., were elected as alternate supervisors. They were immediately sworn into office. Finally, Zhang Sheng, a representative from the municipal party department, and Zhu Guilin, a representative from the social bureau, delivered training speeches successively. After the meeting adjourned, a joint meeting of directors and supervisors was continued, and Chen Songqiu and Wang Lansheng were nominated as managing directors, and Xu Liangshan as managing supervisor. The general affairs section was concurrently held by Chen Songqiu, and the guidance section was held by Chen Songyao. Subsequently, many important cases were discussed, and they were passed item by item. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>(9) Conclusion</p>
<p>At present, most people in the sports field in China have high standards and despise elementary school physical education, which is a big mistake. The reporter witnessed newly graduated normal school students taking up elementary school physical education and had no idea what to do. As a result, the various</p>
<p>Sports skills that he specialized in at school are not applicable at all, so he lacks interest in the position of elementary school physical education instructor and is unwilling to do it, which is a pity. This article is written as a reference. The reporter's recent book "Principles and Methods of Elementary School Physical Education" will be published by Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore. Those who study elementary school physical education can read it.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Chen Kuisheng is an expert in elementary school physical education with rich knowledge. He attended the National Sports Conference held in Beijing as a representative of Hunan Province and made many suggestions to the conference. He was also invited by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to give an 18-hour lecture on elementary school physical education, and all the listeners admired Mr. Chen's remarks.</p>

<h3>Reconstruction of Jinan University After the War</h3>
<p>▲ School Building Repairs Have Been Completed</p>
<p>▲ New and Old Students Are Moving Back in Order</p>
<p>▲ Classes Scheduled to Begin on September 12th</p>
<p>National Jinan University experienced the calamity of the January 28th Incident, and its Zhenru campus became a war zone. Students were scattered in various locations, with the largest numbers remaining in Jiangsu and Guangdong, where schools were successively established to accommodate them. For the university itself, a temporary office was first established on Moliai Road during the height of the war to handle school affairs. Subsequently, a building was rented on Hede Road to begin classes, which officially started on March 21st. At that time, various schools in the war zone suffered severe damage and were unable to resume operations immediately. Students from those schools flocked to Jinan University, requesting to audit classes. To aid these students who had lost their schooling, the university accepted over 300 auditors. After the Japanese troops withdrew, the university dispatched personnel to take over the campus. However, having fallen into enemy hands for over 100 days, the essence of the academic institution was nearly completely lost. The total estimated loss amounted to over 800,000 yuan. Post-war funding was only 30% to 50% of pre-war levels. To maintain the schools in Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Shanghai, the university economized on other expenses and used a portion of the savings to reorganize the entire campus. A Post-War Reorganization Committee was established to plan and execute all tasks. Work progressed with great urgency. The Science Building, which had suffered the most damage from bombing, was repaired a few days ago at a cost of over 7,200 yuan. Dormitories, classrooms, and the sports field were also readied by the 25th of this month. Nearly all of the university's equipment was burned by the Japanese invaders, leaving very little remaining. Newly acquired equipment has been delivered in full, costing over 15,000 yuan. In addition, an electric power plant was established at a cost of 7,700 taels of silver, and a printing office was set up at a cost of over 3,700 yuan. Over 30,000 yuan was spent on adding equipment for the secondary and university divisions, 1,400 taels of silver on a water pumping engine, and over 2,000 yuan on a gas engine. In total, over 100,000 yuan was spent on purchasing and repairing various items. The university did not seek external loans or assistance, and its recovery has been remarkably swift. Currently, departments are being furnished with the aim of restoring the campus to its former glory and further expanding its greatness before the start of the semester. Yesterday, President Zheng, accompanied by the heads of various schools and departments, visited Zhenru to inspect the progress. Finding that the main tasks had been largely completed, he was quite satisfied. It was decided that the Shanghai office would be closed on the 26th of this month, and operations would be moved to Zhenru, with only a small staff remaining to wrap up loose ends. Student enrollment is scheduled for the 27th to 30th of this month, with new students and transfer students paying fees and registering. New students will move in on the 30th, and transfer students will move in on the 31st. Returning students are required to pay fees and register on the 29th and move in on September 1st. The secondary school division is scheduled to pay fees and register on September 1st, with a complete move-in on the same day. The university's Guangdong-based secondary and university divisions have already closed in mid-month, and most students have returned to Shanghai to register. The remaining students in Guangdong have until the 6th to move in. The Suzhou secondary school division is scheduled to close on September 1st and move back to Zhenru. Students auditing at other schools are scheduled to return to Jinan University for review from September 2nd to 6th. Students must consult with their respective deans, department heads, and the head of the secondary school division to determine their plans. A meeting will be held on the 7th to discuss these plans, and course selection will take place from August 8th to 10th. Registration will remain on September 1st, and the entire university is scheduled to officially begin classes on September 12th.</p>
<p>▲ Student Declaration from the College of Education</p>
<p>The students of the College of Education at Jinan University issued the following declaration regarding the college's proposed consolidation (excerpt): (Above omitted) "The central government, mindful of education as the foundation of the nation, has proposed reforming education, a sentiment we all support. However, before reforming university education nationwide, the governing body must investigate the nature of each university and formulate a concrete plan that is shared by the nation. Furthermore, the implementation must adhere to reasonable standards to achieve the overall goal of consolidation. The nature of our university differs from other universities in that it is not limited to educating overseas Chinese students, enabling them to 'gain a greater understanding of their ancestral culture and customs.' It also aims to cultivate domestic youth who aspire to develop overseas. Therefore, its educational mission is twofold. The former can be accomplished by ordinary national universities, but the latter requires specialized research facilities for overseas life and unique training programs for domestic youth, tasks that Jinan University's College of Education is uniquely suited to perform. The college studies overseas life and education on one hand and trains domestic youth for overseas service on the other, thus fulfilling its mission of cultivating ambitious domestic youth (not to mention overseas Chinese students). Failing to understand this purpose will lead to a misunderstanding of the nature of educational reform. Such a misunderstanding is the first error of the Ministry of Education's order to consolidate our college. Modern society is complex, requiring specialized talent among the general populace. Consequently, education has flourished, and the development of education has necessitated the training of educational personnel. Thus, educational professional training has advanced, with teacher training for those engaged in teaching, educational administration training for those in educational administration, and academic research training for those engaged in educational research. While these fields are interconnected, they each possess unique specializations that cannot be treated as uniform. This is why colleges of education are divided into departments to provide specialized training. Our College of Education has also established three departments to cultivate specialized talent. The College of Education at our university bases its education on three missions, dividing its offerings into: (1) the Department of Education, which serves as the main department for those aspiring to study education or engage in educational administration; (2) the Department of Psychology, which serves as the main department for those aspiring to study psychology and its application to education; and (3) the Teacher Training Program, which serves as the main program for those aspiring to teach in secondary schools. From this, it is clear that 'university students studying education' is not merely, as the minister stated, 'preparation for becoming teachers,' and that the entire field of educational science cannot be encompassed by a single department. This point is clear to anyone who understands the meaning of specialized training and should dispel any misunderstandings. As for the Teacher Training Program, it is divided into various groups based on the subjects taught in ordinary secondary schools, such as Chinese Language and Literature, English, History, Geography and Social Studies, Arithmetic, Natural Sciences, Arts, and Physical Education. Students are required to choose one group to specialize in, ensuring that they develop expertise in a specific field while also learning sound educational methods. Based on these facts, the students in our Teacher Training Program are by no means, as Minister Zhu stated, 'lacking in fundamental studies in the liberal arts and sciences,' and 'apart from education subjects,' they will not suffer from the deficiency of 'not knowing what skills to use as teachers.' As for the career prospects of graduates, that is an issue for society as a whole, and the College of Education cannot bear sole responsibility. Furthermore, it cannot be resolved by 'changing the college into a department.' This is the second error of the Ministry of Education's order to consolidate our college." (Below omitted)</p>

<h3>New Developments at Jiangnan Physical Education Teachers College</h3>
<p>▲ Establishing a Separate Women's Division</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Physical Education Teachers College on Hede Road in Shanghai, though short in history, has achieved remarkable success. Renowned throughout the region for its diligent operations, the college has seen a surge in applications for this year's enrollment. As of yesterday, it was reported that 104 new students, both male and female, have been admitted. Due to insufficient existing facilities and concerns about management issues arising from co-education, the college has leased a brand-new Western-style building at the intersection of Hede Road and Kang'nou't Road, in the Rusheng Lane, as a separate women's division. This is expected to ensure balanced development for both the men's and women's divisions in the future. Regarding faculty, in addition to Principal Wang Fudan himself, the college has successively appointed Li Jiyuan as the Director of Academic Affairs, Shen Kunnan and Guo Zhaoming as ball sports instructors, Wu Demao as a track and field lecturer, Cao Yu, Hao Chunde, and Wang Jihuai as honorary track and field instructors, Hu Changzhi as a Chinese and English teacher, Zou Yinlu as a gymnastics and acrobatic sports professor, and Shao Jinying, Zhang Yuzhi, and Zhang Huazhen as female student advisors.</p>
<p>[P Huiping Middle School Scheduled to Open</p>
<p>Huiping Middle School on Y'erpei Road, previously approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to open a first-year class for both junior and senior high school levels, has already reached full enrollment after two rounds of admissions on the 28th of last month and the 20th of this month. The school is scheduled to officially open on September 1st and plans to hold its inaugural opening ceremony, with Chairman of the Board Chen Gongbo invited to deliver a speech. Inquiries from out-of-town students requesting special consideration have been arriving daily. It is reported that the school has been working to expand its capacity and will hold a third round of admissions for new students.</p>

<h3>20th Army Football Team vs. Qinghua</h3>
<p>▲ Good Sportsmanship Results in a Tie</p>
<p>▲ Today's Volleyball Game: 20th Army vs. Lingnan</p>
<p>The unprecedented 20th Army Expedition Football Team played its first match yesterday against the Qinghua Football Team at the China Baseball Field. Their performance was quite impressive, with all players being graduates of schools who are now high-ranking officers. For example, the center forward of the football team, Liu Ximeng, was a star player at Shanghai Jiaotong University two years ago. The Qinghua Football Team has a strong record in the summer football tournament. Yesterday's match between the two teams drew a crowd of approximately 700-800 spectators eager to witness the skills of the 20th Army athletes, who are pioneers in military sports. After a fierce battle, each team scored one goal, resulting in a harmonious tie and a joyful conclusion. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>22▲33 Day</p>
<p>Bai Weitang Xin Dema Ma Zuyin Zhong Shijing</p>
<p>Huang Ying Zhang Shuqiao Wu Chunqing</p>
<p>Feng Lixia (Up) Yin Li (Up) Liu Ximeng</p>
<p>Yang Shimin (Down) Zhang Li (Down) Tong Yu Zhang Congyun</p>
<p>Qinghua</p>
<p>Huang Guorong</p>
<p>Yao Zhenggang Chen Yaoping Fu Zhibin</p>
<p>Xu Chenshu Ye Jinming Shao Qihua</p>
<p>Zuo Huoyao Wu Xinxiang Cao Qiuting Jin Changfa</p>
<p>▲ Strength of the Expedition Team: The team's talent is quite evenly distributed, but their coordination is lacking, and their footwork is relatively soft. Center forward Liu Ximeng and center back Zhang Shuqiao are both brave and skilled. Left winger Ma Zuyin dribbles quickly and is quite experienced, especially with corner kicks, which he executes skillfully every time. Goalkeeper Huang Ying is relatively steady, and the defenders are not weak. The only shortcomings are that the midfielders and forwards cannot cooperate effectively. As for the Qinghua team, they could have secured a victory, but their shooting was poor, the midfielders failed to support the forwards, and the forwards did not retreat to assist the defense.</p>
<p>▲ First Half: A goal apiece</p>
<p>The game began at 5:00 PM with Le Xiurong as the referee. The 20th Army started on the offensive, but they were hampered by a strong headwind and were heavily pressured by Qinghua. After ten minutes, Qinghua's center forward Shao Qihua shot on goal, but the goalkeeper deflected the ball. Qinghua's Cao Huanting followed up with a shot that opened the scoring, giving Qinghua a one-goal lead. Afterwards, Qinghua's momentum continued, and the Expeditionary Force's goal was under heavy siege. They had over ten scoring opportunities but failed to convert any of them. After twenty minutes, the visiting team launched a surprise attack, taking advantage of the opponent's rear weakness and secretly maneuvering their troops. Tong Xianyu, positioned on the left wing, passed the ball to the front of Qinghua's goal. With Qinghua's goalkeeper blinded by the sun, his vision was obscured, and the ball went into the goal, tying the score at one apiece. The first half ended with this score.</p>
<p>▲ Second Half: A Draw</p>
<p>After a lemon-time break, the wind direction changed, and the visiting team launched a major offensive with considerable momentum. Qinghua was forced to defend on all sides and struggled to cope. However, the visiting team's shooting was poor, and despite several opportunities, they squandered them. Left winger Ma Zuyin's skillful corner kicks only drew applause and failed to lead to a goal due to a lack of teammates to receive the ball. After twenty minutes, the situation suddenly changed again. Qinghua, with a disorganized formation, invaded the visiting team's rear, creating a tense situation. The visiting team's goal was under constant bombardment, but Qinghua's luck was poor. Despite having excellent opportunities, the ball repeatedly sailed over the goal line without entering, leading to wasted effort and self-blame. The match ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>▲ Today's Volleyball Match</p>
<p>The 20th Army volleyball team will compete against the Lingnan team today at 4:00 PM at the China Athletics Field. It is reported that both teams have strong lineups, and a high-quality performance is expected. Li Feiyun has been appointed as the referee.</p>
<h3>Three Summer Football Matches Today</h3>

<p>(Note) The match between Xingguang and Qiangnan will still be held at the originally scheduled time of 5:00 PM tomorrow at the football field.</p>
<h3>Motorcycle Touring Race</h3>
<p>▲ First Trial Run Tomorrow (August 20th)</p>
<p>The China Motorcycle Club's planned China International Touring Motorcycle Trial Race is scheduled to take place from October 7th to 9th. The registration deadline is at the end of this month, and there has been enthusiastic participation, though relatively few Chinese participants. As the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Beijing national highway is not yet perfect, a trial race has been specifically scheduled for 9:00 AM tomorrow to allow participants to understand the road conditions and avoid any difficulties. The race will start at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Minhang Road and end in Minhang. The club hopes that participants will continue across the river for another 30 li, as there are more than 40 low-lying spots within this 30 li stretch that must be tested. All club members and registered participants are welcome to participate. The official race will take place on October 7th, 8th, and 9th, which fall on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, respectively. Furthermore, October 10th is National Day, making it convenient for participants in terms of time. The registration fee is 25 yuan for the individual group and 50 yuan per person for the team group, including meals and accommodation. The club hopes that more Chinese people will participate. The regulations are appended below.</p>

<h3>Dum Dum Bullet</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The Dum Dum bullet, also known as the Damm Damm bullet, is a poisonous bullet banned by international conventions. During the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese militarists, in their frenzy, dared to defy conventions and actually used this bullet against our troops. Countless innocent civilians suffered from its effects. This sufficiently demonstrates the Japanese militarists' ambition and cruelty. The name "Dum Dum" has its origins. Dum Dum is a small town in Bengal, British India, located near the provincial capital of Calcutta. From 1783 to 1853, Dum Dum served as the general depot for the Bengal artillery. The town also had a cannon factory and a shell factory, hence the name "Arsenal of India's Huerwei District" (Britain considered Huerwei District to be its weapons production base, while India considered Dum Dum to be its weapons production base). At the time, there were mutinies and disturbances by Indian troops and sudden attacks by tribal people along the border. These people were fiercely passionate, brave, and unafraid of death, so ordinary bullets could not stop their malevolent aura. Therefore, the shell factory specially created a type of bullet made of lead encased in steel. The steel at the tip of the bullet was extremely thin. When fired from a powerful rifle, upon striking a person, the thin and soft steel nose would burst open, and the lead core would firmly grip the flesh, causing indescribable pain from the wound. This is the true origin of the Dum Dum bullet. There is also a method of modifying ordinary bullets by simply filing the tip with a file, creating a long crack in the nickel shell until the lead core is exposed. The bursting effect is almost identical to that of a specially manufactured bullet. Using this type of bullet to subdue those unafraid of death was not considered regrettable. However, the Japanese militarists relied on their power to invade China and wantonly used this inhumane poisonous bullet. If there is justice in the world, I wonder how they will be punished. In the past, the British used this bullet against the Sudanese in their colony of Egypt. At the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1899, there were allegations that the British army also used it in the Battle of Eto in South Africa. People rose up in protest. In fact, the British army did not use it at that time. The participating countries agreed to an international treaty stipulating that this bullet should not be used in wartime. All countries agreed except for Britain and the United States. However, with the majority in favor, the treaty was established. During the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905, the Japanese government also lodged a serious protest against the Russian army for using this bullet. Now the Japanese militarists are acting so rampantly against us. I wonder what kind of attitude our government officials will take. However, I know that other than signing a ceasefire agreement, everything else is not worth considering. Alas.</p>
<h3>Heartfelt Words of Yinghua</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiang</p>
<p>Wang Songxi of Loudong was a respected elder in the late Qing Dynasty. His scholarship and writings commanded respect in his hometown. In his old age, he wrote a self-composed elegy: "In life, I lacked a good reputation, fortunately the model still exists. I never engaged in dog-hole affairs. After death, what extravagant hopes do I have? I only wish my descendants will not follow, and there will never be opium smokers." He instructed his disciple Zhang Sai of Nantong to write it down and preserve it to show to future generations. He was seventy-four years old at the time, in the Guangxu year of Yihai. Upon his death, his children and grandchildren engraved it on a board, which is still hung in the hall as a family motto. It can be seen that throughout his life, he most loathed opium, hence he focused on this and solemnly mentioned it. Wang can be considered a "frontline rejectionist."</p>
<h3>An Old Account</h3>
<p>— Xu Qin Fu</p>
<p>I unearthed an account book from twenty-five years ago, dating back to my student days, from a pile of old papers. Naturally, it's a record of absolutely no value. And in my small bookshelf, logically, it doesn't have a place. To put it bluntly, it "should have been burned long ago." However, as I held this account book in my hands, without even examining it – indeed, there was no need to examine it – a feeling arose within me. Needless to say, this feeling belongs only to me, absolutely unrelated to anyone else. But the force of this feeling filled my mind with twenty years of memories, and I couldn't help but stare at the account book, lost in a daze. And then, unknowingly, I opened the account book. Even more unconsciously, I saw – ah! This further evoked boundless feelings within me. Moreover, these feelings are not limited to me alone. Any friend who sees this account book of mine would probably have the same feelings. I'm not exaggerating or making a fuss. Do you, my friends, have children studying at school? Have you yourselves graduated from school or are you currently studying abroad? Please compare your educational expenses with mine. You'll naturally, and very carefully, keep reading. Perhaps there are also meticulous friends who will pick up their abacuses and do the math for me. Three fives are fifteen, four fours are sixteen... and tally it all up for me!</p>
<p>The first page of the account book lists the payments to the school. It reads: "One, payment to the school for this semester's room and board: 25 silver dollars. Tuition: 5 dollars. Book fees: 5 dollars." (At that time, a semester was six months, but all fees were calculated for five months, excluding the summer vacation.) "Uniform and exercise clothes fees: a total of 5 dollars." (This purchase lasted for three or four semesters, costing a little over a dollar per semester.) "The above totals 40 silver dollars." This day was probably before the start of the semester, so there are several miscellaneous items listed afterward. One entry is for going out with two classmates and buying a pair of satin shoes, costing 1 dollar, and a satin cap, costing 40 cents. We ate five meat buns, each costing 3 cash, for a total of 45 cash. This completed the eleventh page of the account. The daily expenses below are copied for five days. First day: 12 cash for buns, 20 cash for washing a long gown, totaling 32 cash. Second day: 8 cash for sesame cakes, 20 cash for washing a short shirt and pants, totaling 30 cash. Third day: 9 cash for meat dumplings, 10 cash for washing socks, 16 cash for a shave, totaling 35 cash. Fourth day: 12 cash for buns, 72 cash for "Bandit Brand" cigarettes (this was a private expense, forbidden in school). (At that time, this was a very popular cigarette among the middle and lower classes, costing 36 cash per pack of ten.) Totaling 84 cash. Fifth day: 20 cash for sesame cakes (at that time, sesame cakes cost 3 cash each and were slightly larger than today's crab shell cakes. This day I probably treated everyone, otherwise, I wouldn't have eaten more than ten). 20 cash for laundry, totaling 50 cash.</p>
<p>Seeing these accounts truly reminds me of the burden of studying at that time (actually, not only studying, it could truly be considered light...). But I still remember our fathers and elder brothers already sighing and saying, "Studying these days is really difficult. It's more than ten times different compared to when we were young." I can't bear to destroy this "old account book." I patted off the dust, smoothed out the creases, and quickly hid it in the trunk.</p>
<h3>Wang Qingxun's Harmonica</h3>
<p>— Wu Shuang</p>
<p>The way of music is connected with governance. The ancients used rites and music to educate people, truly believing that music moves people the deepest, cultivating temperament, its merit being greatly significant. Since the demise of refined music, vulgar Zheng melodies have flourished, lower-class songs of the common people, decadent sounds leading to national ruin, the world rushing headlong, which is why the morality of the world is declining day by day. In recent years, Western music has flowed into China. Schools which were once places of stringed instruments and singing, now all sing "Mi Mi Sha Sha" tunes. Theaters and movie houses compete to play jazz waltz music. Rapid flutes and complex strings intoxicate people. Pianos, organs, and extravagant tunes, are extremely popular for a time. However, if one wants to call it "People's Music", then only the harmonica is worthy. The harmonica (Harmonic or Mouthorgan) was initially popular in Germany, then in countries like America and France. Now it is also extremely popular in Japan (Kawasho Kugyo being the most famous). It is truly because the harmonica is like a petite and exquisite beauty, indeed the most convenient companion to carry. Furthermore, the price is low, not requiring ten "hu" to measure pearls, therefore it perfectly suits the music of the masses. As for before flowers and under the moon, climbing mountains and facing the water, or paddling mid-stream with like-minded friends, or after wine and tea with two or three close friends, a harmonica tune is more joyful than the light singing and low sipping of clappers and red teeth. Some say that the harmonica is just a toy for children, how can it be compared with pianos and violins? They don't know that what pianos and violins can play, like "polyphony," "arpeggio," "tremolo," "vibrato," "octave," "ornamentation," and "high and low semitones," the harmonica can do none the less. Therefore, since Mr. Wang Qingxun advocated it, the harmonica became popular for a time. Mr. Wang is from Taiwan and has a great love for music, especially excelling in the harmonica. He has spared no effort in promoting and teaching it. He organized a harmonica band at Great China University, and then extended it to Wuxi, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. Wherever he went, he received enthusiastic welcomes. His performances in various places are like lamenting, like longing, like weeping, like complaining, like the sudden arrival of wind and rain, like the competition of rapid flutes and complex strings. Songs such as Serenade, Faust, Reva Lita, La Traviata, Parisian Girl, Long Longing, Double Eagle March, Late Summer Rose, etc., have been recorded into phonographs or added to broadcasts, and Tianyi Film Company has even included them in talking movies. Mr. Wang's skills can be seen generally. Mr. Feng Zikai wrote in the preface to Mr. Wang's harmonica playing method, "In the country of art, there are palaces of literature, art, and music. People compete to visit them. The first gate of the palaces of literature and art are open to all, and everyone can enter. However, the gate of the palace of music has the strictest entry restrictions. Those who do not hold an admission ticket cannot step into its courtyard... Mr. Wang Qingxun is the ticket seller at that gate." In fact, Mr. Wang has laid the foundation for the palace of the Chinese harmonica. How can he be just someone who sells tickets?</p>
<h3>A Secret History of the Twenty-One Demands (5)</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>Heki Masu sat like a stone statue, listening to my opinions, without refuting them. I spoke for half an hour. Heki Masu did not deny the Twenty-One Demands incident. His intention in wanting me to go was not solely for China, nor solely for America, but actually to maintain the initial peace between the three countries. He thanked me for his kind intentions.</p>
<p>Upon parting, he very unnaturally said to me, "I am afraid that Japan has gone too far in following Germany's policies. But what can I do? I must obey the government's orders." I said, "You should act on your own initiative. If I were to represent my government, and I thought that the path the government was taking was wrong and dangerous for the government, I would fight for it even if it meant resigning." After I finished speaking, I left.</p>
<p>Soon after, I went to see Reinsch, and learned that he had already met with Jordan. Jordan felt very disheartened by Japan's actions, feeling that the benefits that Britain had striven for in the Far East for a century were about to be lost. His meaning was that because Britain was currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Germany, he hoped that America would save China. Reinsch told me to write a letter to Stone of the Associated Press.</p>
<p>After my meeting with Reinsch, I wrote a four-page letter to President Wilson, explaining why the United States should protest to Japan regarding the Twenty-One Demands. I also wrote a letter to Secretary of State Bryan, detailing the content of the Twenty-One Demands and the reasons why the American government should issue a serious protest on moral, political, and commercial grounds. I also argued that the United States should not threaten Japan with a declaration of war, because the United States could not send troops to conquer Japan five thousand miles away. The United States could only declare that if Japan insisted on its Twenty-One Demands, the United States would submit the matter to the Hague Tribunal after the end of the European war. The United States would unite with all the countries of the world to urge Japan to return sovereignty to China. Japan also did not have the ability to cross five thousand miles of ocean to attack the United States, so the United States did not need to be afraid of Japan declaring war on America.</p>
<p>After sending out several letters, I went to visit Morrison, Yuan Shikai's advisor. A day or two later, I also visited Cai Tinggan, detailing the events. Cai Tinggan was very grateful to me, and on behalf of Yuan Shikai, told me to rush to America to lobby, with 20,000 yuan as the initial expense, and more funds would be remitted after arriving in America. I expressed that I could not accept a single cent from the Chinese government, and only agreed to go to America to visit Wilson and Bryan in a private capacity as a church representative. On March 23, 1915, I left Beijing and went to Shanghai to board a ship to America.</p>

<h3>The Sharp Fall in Gold Specie is Fierce</h3>
<p>▲ The plunge of ten taels and six mace. Yesterday, the fall in gold specie intensified. However, the market was still calm throughout the day. Both the morning and afternoon markets had reversals of more than five taels. The final plunge was more than ten taels. Major players were all scrambling to sell, and the mood was extremely nervous. The opening price had already broken 710 taels, probably because the silver market was reported to be rising, and the market price of the silver exchange had almost also risen. After that, there were slight advances and retreats. As for the foreign exchange trend, it was quite loose. Although banks were taking in, there was no profit to be made from hedging. They could only sell US dollars and gold specie from both sides, which intensified the selling wind in the domestic market, and the price dropped sharply, with a slight decline of five or six taels. In the afternoon market, British and American exchanges felt even looser and more excessive, because Da Xing Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Xing Yuan, etc., were pouring out sales in swarms. The market situation was extremely sluggish, with a general sense of collapse. Suddenly, the 700 taels barrier was broken, and a new low price of 690 taels and two mace was seen. The final plunge stopped, and it had already broken through the border, with a price of around 701 taels. However, the price of silver may be on the rise. Here is a detailed record of the market situation.</p>
<p>▲ The selling pressure before the midday close gradually intensified. The market opened early at 708 taels for October, immediately falling three taels and nine mace, then to 707 taels and a half. The high amount rose by one-sixteenth, and the silver price increased by one-eighth. However, private telegrams rose by one-quarter, and future silver even rose by more than two cents, and the exchange rate was still high, which was unfavorable for the gold market. (However, the off-market price of goods had been shouted at around ten taels.) Then, because Heng Xing Yuan, Yu He, Bing Xing, Yuan Heng, Yuan Kang, Xiang Heng, Yu, etc., came to purchase, it increased to 709 taels. After entering, there was a sudden amount of around one tael. At 9:10, Heng Xing, Tai Chang, Heng Xing Yuan, Heng Yu, Heng Chang Yong, etc., all sold, and immediately plummeted to 707 taels and two mace. Almost, US dollars were sold by Andata, Citibank, etc., to HSBC for 31.5 yuan for December. When HSBC posted the price, it did not change, being 708 taels and three mace. Then Zhao Feng Chang, Shun Li Fu, Tai Heng came in. Then they continued to add six or seven mace. Heng Xing Yuan, Yi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, etc., all entered. Also, Guangdong merchant Heng Xing came out and repurchased, until Hua Bi absorbed half a yuan for December US dollars. At 9:45, 709 taels was again seen. Unfortunately, it repeatedly failed to break through 710 taels, and even Heng Xing Yuan, Heng Chang Yong, Yuan Tai Hong, Kang Yong, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Xie Xing Yong, Fu Xing Yong, etc., increased their selling pressure, so the price went downward. British gold firms mutually did business at 68.75 for November and 75 for December, and US dollars at 56.25 for December, and both entry and exit could be transacted. At 10:45, it was 706 taels and two mace. In this hour, only a few mace to at most one tael revolved. Suddenly, Guangdong merchants Yi Feng and Qian Chang Xiang Heng Xing Yuan, etc., bought in, and the Mai firm absorbed 56.25 for December US dollars, and then added one tael and a half. At 11:15, it was 707 taels and seven mace. Afterwards, the plunge became more severe, truly because major players were dumping sales, and the situation was also not without influence. It is estimated that Yuan Xing Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Yu Heng Xing Yuan, Zhao Feng Chang, Da Xing Yong, etc., frantically dumped sales, but buyers were not happy, so the market price flowed downwards, plunging four taels. In the meantime, there were only a few mace up and down. When the market was about to close, it was finally 703 taels and five mace, and banks were willing to release 31.5625 for December US dollars, and then slightly added six or seven mace. By the midday close, it was 704 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Major sellers swarmed in the afternoon market. The market opened in the afternoon at 704 taels and two mace, and US dollars were directly paired for 125 this month and 1875 for September. Da De Cheng, etc., all entered, and then it was 704 taels and nine mace. Afterwards, it was so-so, with ups and downs of about five or six mace. After 2:45, Yi Feng Yong Heng Xing Yuan Hong Kang Yong Heng Yu Zhi Feng Yong Dalian gangs, etc., tirelessly dumped sales, and first ordered 625 for the near term to be sold, and the US dollars first absorbed 6875, then 75, and then the gold price plunged three taels. At 3:00, it was 701 taels and six mace. However, Yi Feng Yong and retail buyers bought in, and then it improved by six or seven mace, to 702 taels and three mace. In an instant, the waves were turbulent, and US dollars were even tighter, and 75 for December was difficult to sell, and it had to be 8125. The selling atmosphere was rampant in the market, and Zhi Feng Yong Hong Kang Yong Fu Yu Sen Chang Yong Zhao Feng Chang Da Xing Yong Heng Xing Yuan, etc., competed to dump sales, causing the price to fall by three taels in a moment. People were terrified, and the atmosphere deteriorated. At 3:30, it was 699 taels and two mace. Zhi Feng Yong Yi Feng Yong suddenly re-entered, and it suddenly rebounded to 700 taels, at 701 taels and eight mace. Then it retreated again to 701 taels. When the market closed at 4:00, it was 701 taels and three mace, a sharp drop of ten taels and six mace compared to the previous day. According to the maximum price of the day, 709 taels, and the minimum of 699 taels and two mace, the difference was nine taels and eight mace. The naked amount increased by ten taels, and there was some trading between firms.</p>
<p>▲ The announced price was suppressed by more than ten taels. The off-market price was still 784 taels, a discount of 75 or 76 taels to 80 taels. In the afternoon, it was 80 taels to 85 taels, and finally 83 taels, a discount of more than ten taels compared to the previous day. Entered on the books, 04 taels, make up water, 04 taels, afternoon, 01 taels. ▲ The supply side occupies an absolute advantage. Although transactions on the table are strong, the supply exceeds demand. Statistics show that Yi Feng, Heng Xing, Qian Chang Xiang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Fu Tai Xiang, Bing Xing, Yuan Kang Xiang, Yi Feng Yong, etc., are buying. Tong Tai Chang, Da Xing Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Da Yong, Yuan Tai, Heng Chang Yong, Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Xie Xing Yong, Hong Kang Yong are all exiting. Heng Xing Yuan bought over a thousand bars, exiting two thousand several hundred bars. Heng Yu, Yuan Heng, Fu Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, and the entry and exit of goods are very frequent. In the afternoon, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Xing, Yi Feng Yong all entered. Heng Xing Yuan, Shun Li, Bing Xing, Zhao Feng Chang, Da Xing Yong, Hong Kang Yong all exited. Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Yu He, Tong Yu Run, Tong Fu, Yi Yu, etc., entered and exited from time to time. It should be said that the Dalian gang advanced first and then exited, totaling more than 600 bars bought and more than 500 bars exited. The Guangdong gang entered more than 600 bars and exited more than 200 bars. The speculator (referring to Wu) was out traveling, so his personal transactions were not large, it is said. The bar amount of each firm is estimated to be over 23,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Extremely Loose and There is Little Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market rebounded, and the exchange rate was level for British pounds and up for US dollars. As for HSBC's posted prices, there were no changes, only "Heyang" added 25, and the French franc was slightly one yuan less. The domestic market was quite loose, with few rebounds, because the gold market was extremely weak, breaking 710 taels in the morning market, and finally entering the 700 taels barrier in the afternoon market, and the selling pressure was particularly strong. The result was that compared to the previous night, British gold was up 1875 and US dollars were up 375. Overseas silver markets may increase further, and the international economic conference, according to the American side, expressed extreme sympathy, seemingly with the expectation of maintaining silver prices. Yesterday, although the transactions in the Chinese gold industry were not as strong as the previous day, they were not lazy either. An estimated 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and the various firms transacted with each other. About 600,000 to 700,000 yuan in US dollars were traded. Most of the gold firms dumped sales, but did not hedge, because the gold specie drop was cheaper, and there was no profit to be made from many parties. Therefore, they only sold exchange tickets, and the gold price became even softer. The forward US dollars were hedged at an estimated 50 taels, slightly tighter than before. However, according to the posted price, the discount was over 80 taels, but banks still had a strong buying interest.</p>
<p>The British exchange domestic market fluctuated by 125 throughout the day. In the morning, the selling price was 1 shilling 9 and a half pence to 75, and the buying price was 5625 to 8125. The Yokohama Specie Bank and HSBC directly traded 6875 for November, and Andata and Union traded at the same price. Andata also sold 75 for December to the Netherlands. Mitsui and Yokohama Specie Bank traded 5625 for August. The midday closing bid was 5625 to 8125 for selling and 625 to 875 for buying. In the afternoon, Zhongfu absorbed 625 for September. The closing selling price was 625 to 875, and the buying price was 6875 to 9375.</p>
<p>▲ The US exchange domestic market fluctuated by 375 in both the morning and afternoon markets. The early opening selling price was 31 yuan for August, 0625 for September, 1875 for October, 375 for November, and 4375 for December. The buying price was 125 to 5625. Andata, HSBC, Citibank, and Mai firms entered half a yuan for December. East Asia and Shanghai traded 1875 for October. Huabi entered half a yuan for December. Shanghai and HSBC mutually traded 0625 for August. The Netherlands and Meifeng traded 5625 for December. Huabi and Korea traded 0625 for August. The Mai firm absorbed 5625 for December. The midday closing selling price was 31 yuan 0625 to half a yuan, and the buying price was 1875 to 625. In the afternoon, Andata and Yokohama Specie Bank directly traded 125 for August. Shanghai and the Netherlands traded 1875 for September, and Andata and Zhongnan mutually traded at the same price. Huabi, the Mai firm, and Andata entered 6875 for December. Huabi and Mitsui entered 75 for December. The Mai firm entered 8125. The closing selling price was 25 to 6875, and the buying price was 375 to 8125. Also, the posted price was one yuan, equivalent to 3 taels 2 mace 6 fen 53 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>High Volume Up 1875</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 26th telegram: High Volume Up 1875. Recent term 18 pence 13125, long term 18 pence 4375. British-American exchange rate, opening at 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Silver Coin Fluctuations</h3>
<p>▲ Market trends are relatively sluggish. Yesterday's silver coin transaction conditions, silver loans and drafts are still not very large, and pawn transactions are also few. Silver coin trading, whether simple or complex, is moderate, and the coin price continued to fall in the morning market, and suddenly rebounded in the afternoon market. It can be seen that in the recent three or several days, either it rises early and falls in the afternoon, or it falls early and rises in the afternoon, but the result tends to be downstream, indicating that the market is not yet at a turning point.</p>
<p>▲ Silver coin and silver drafts continue to be small in unison. (Silver coin) The morning market coin price was 6 qian 8 fen 8 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half, slightly smaller by half a li than the previous day's afternoon market, and the afternoon market rebounded 375, to 6 qian 8 fen 8 li and a half, and the result was slightly smaller by 1 hao 2 hu and a half compared to the previous afternoon. (Silver Draft) The morning and afternoon markets were both 5 fen, slightly smaller by 1 fen than the previous day. The markup plus water was 3 or 4 fen, and the silver situation remained unchanged.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangnan and Guangdong silver coins have their own strengths and weaknesses. Jiangnan small silver coins had no possible rise or fall in the morning market because there were no transactions, and the result was still 6 qian. The afternoon market changed slightly by 1 li, to 5 qian 9 fen 9 li, with 2,000 jiao traded. Guangdong small silver coins, the morning market was 5 qian 8 fen 1 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, and the afternoon market was 5 qian 8 fen 2 li, with 95,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 40,000 jiao traded in the afternoon market. The market prices of the two types of silver coins fluctuated with each other in the morning and afternoon markets, but the difference was extremely small. Copper coins shrunk by 500 wen, to 432,000 wen, with 49,680 strings of wen traded, totaling 11,500 taels of silver coins.</p>
<p>▲ Silver coins enter and exit and share honor and disgrace. (Silver Coins) Yesterday, the banks received and delivered 1.9 million silver coin tickets from Chinese merchants, 1.6 to 1.7 million silver coin tickets from foreign merchants, 8.7 to 8.8 million for various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and miscellaneous items, over 900,000 in pawn transactions, 700,000 entering the warehouse, 300,000 exiting the warehouse, over 28 million in single receipts from Qianzhuang Silver Public, over 4.2 million in markup items, over 900,000 in various remittances, and 2 or 300,000 in delivered funds. (Silver Coins) The exchange rate of tickets, 700,000 were made in the morning market, and 550,000 were made in the afternoon market. Paper money was 90,000 in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. Off-market paper money was 140,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Only 50,000 in checks were in the morning market. Bank trading, 650,000 in mutual trading in the morning market, 500,000 in the afternoon market. Over 1.3 million in interbank silver account receipts and deliveries, over 2.6 million in banknotes redeemed and issued, over 400,000 in silver pawn transactions, over 6.4 million in single receipts from Qianzhuang Silver Public, over 2.1 million in silver markup items, over 2.2 million in silver loan ins and outs, and over 400,000 in small Qianzhuang transactions.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>▲ Transactions of 4.95 Million Yuan</p>
<p>▲ August Futures Market will be Suspended Starting Today</p>
<p>Yesterday (26th), the bond market conditions of the Chinese Securities Exchange, there was no market in the spot market in the morning, and only 5,000 yuan was traded in the afternoon market. The futures market was still not deserted. It is estimated that 3 million yuan was opened in the morning and over 1.9 million yuan in the afternoon. The environment has not changed at all, and as the delivery date approaches, people are observing the market transactions, with more attention to changing and settling. The demand and supply are extremely flat, and the prices are as stagnant as before. The ups and downs between the various markets are very slight, only 2 or 3 jiao up and down compared to the previous day. Judging from the current environmental situation, it is difficult to expect changes for a while. Also, the August futures of each bond was the last day of trading yesterday, and the auction will be suspended starting today to handle various procedures before delivery, it is said.</p>
<p>Bond Futures/Spot Previous Opening Later Closing Change from Previous Day Transaction Amount</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Affected by Rumors</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation became chaotic again, making it even more difficult to stabilize people's hearts. However, Rong Xing still purchased more shares, and the pulling force was very strong. Rumors occurred in the market in the afternoon, and the gold price fell within the 700 tael barrier, and the market fell sharply. In short, the price has been high, and the changes are more active, but the overseas situation is still strong, and the bulls are applying advances on dips, and the momentum is quite strong, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ The selling momentum in the afternoon market after the human auction gradually intensified. Before the opening of the human auction market, the price of American cotton continued to rise, and the prices of each month rose by 4, 5, 7 or 8 qian. After the opening of the afternoon market, it was still good, but there were many rumors in the second and third rounds, and the selling momentum was high, and the prices of each month fell by 9 qian to 1 liang 3, 5, 6, or 8 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 41,300 bales. It was found that Guangfeng sold 1,950 bales, Yiyu sold 1,400 bales, and Yukang sold 750 bales, and Yida sold 755 bales. Hengyi bought 1,450 bales, Rongxing bought 1,200 bales, Tongxing bought 1,050 bales, Yichang bought 1,450 bales, and Senkang bought 1,450 bales. The closing price is listed below:</p>

<p>October 1554 11 86,850 Total 448,600</p>
<p>▲ 1,600 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded. The off-take of spot yarn is still good. It was found that the total amount bought by all gangs for the day was 1,600 bales, and the market price rose by 5 qian to 1 liang in the morning and fell by 5 qian to 1 liang in the afternoon. The price of thread rose by 2 or 3 liang. The purchase amount of each party is listed below:</p>

<p>Inland 125 Wuhu 5 Ningbo 15 Total 1,600 Bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Soft in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market trended upwards in the morning, and the market atmosphere became tighter as American cotton rose by another 15 pounds. However, this caused some profit-takers to unwind, and the market was hard but soft. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price had once fallen, and the yarn market had fallen back, and the market atmosphere suddenly turned downward. In short, in this new cotton era, those with high prices and real goods sell them at a lower price, but Indian and American cotton are extremely expensive, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ The Zheng Biao Market Consistently Relaxes Qian Ban. Before the opening of the Zheng Biao market, the market trended upward with further increases in American and Indian cotton, with retailers resisting shorts, and each month rose by 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, the market suddenly fell, and each month fell by 2, 3, or 4 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 132,800 dan. It was found that Yu Chang sold 4,000 dan, Yuanda sold 2,100 dan, Suilong sold 3,000 dan, and Zhenda sold 4,100 dan. Rongxing bought 8,800 dan, Shenchang bought 5,200 dan, Deki bought 6,500 dan, Yuanda bought 3,800 dan, and Changhe bought 2,300 dan. The closing prices are listed separately below:</p>

<p>November 3435 10 266,000</p>
<p>▲ 200 bales of spot cotton are opened. The off-take of spot cotton is still calm. The source is estimated to be 1,260 bales of Yaohua cotton, it is said.</p>
<p>American seed cotton 37.25 Tongyi enters 100 pieces for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Ling Shi cotton 37.75 Xin Shen enters 100 pieces for delivery to the factory</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton's Rising Wind Resumes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially strong because of poor crop conditions and mass buying, and then weakened due to some bulls taking profits and unwinding. Futures prices rose by 11 to 14 pounds, and spot prices rose by 15 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 40 to 42 points, and spot prices rose by 41 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 55 points. Indian cotton was strong and up due to the rise in American cotton, enthusiastic buyers, and speculation. Pingle rose by 13.5 rupees, Omla rose by 13.5 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 13 rupees, according to the original telegram records. (Telegraph of the 25th)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Cotton Yarn Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Tianjin News (25th): The cotton market in Xihe is quiet. The anti-tax movement against increased cotton tariffs yesterday has yet to yield results. All transactions to various Chinese concession areas and yarn factories have been halted. Existing stock within the foreign concessions can be transacted with some flexibility, but there are no large sums involved. The trend appears to be downward. Qingxi Company purchased 284 bales at a quoted price of 25.8 taels. The cotton yarn market continues to be sluggish and stable. Gaoyang traders purchased 32 bundles of Caiqiu yarn at a price of 167 taels.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Prices Fall by 10-20 Cents</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, more than 20 merchants came from various groups in Shanghai South. There was a slight surplus in the Pudong area. Business was poor in both urban and rural shops. Changshu and Wuxi Japonica rice and Sutong traders' prices each fell by 10-20 cents. The arrival of new Japonica rice was limited due to wind delays. The market opened and the sales of early and late rice were balanced, with no price fluctuations.</p>
<p>▲ About a dozen merchants came from Xinzha West Road. Local sales were active at first but then slowed down. Kunshan and Anting Japonica rice fell by 20 cents. Changshu, Wuxi, Liyang and other white Japonica rice also fell by 5 cents. Thin rice supplies were scarce, and rural businesses were active, leading to a tighter situation. Luxiang sharp rice saw no change in price. Daily sales were around 2,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Initially Weak, Then Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market started weak, but in the afternoon, Ningbo, Shaoxing and other inland merchants bought 1,200 bags of Saigon rice. Merchants from Nanjing and Chongming also bought 1,000 bags of Small Jia rice. Merchants from this street also bought 300 bags of Siamese rice, and the market began to stabilize. The price of Hunan rice was reported to be high, and people hoped for better sales. Prices of various rice types were similar to the previous day, with Saigon rice at 9.65-9.60 yuan, Small Jia at 9.15-9.05 yuan, old Small Jia at 8.88 yuan, and Siamese rice at 9.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Foreign Rice Stocks in the City</h3>
<p>The reason for the decline in foreign rice prices is weak sales and sufficient inventory. The total stock of foreign rice in the city is estimated to be over 1.4 million bags. Of these, about 200,000 bags are held in Japanese company warehouses, sold through Japanese merchants, or in transit. The remaining are stored in foreign warehouses at various wharves. Detailed statistics for this month are as follows:</p>
<p>Yangjiadu China Merchants Warehouse 70,193 Longmao Warehouse 256,757</p>
<p>Jinliyuan China Merchants Warehouse 1,641 Jardine Matheson Warehouse 75,110</p>
<p>China Merchants Hua Warehouse 53,891 Gonghexiang Warehouse 10,004</p>
<p>China Merchants Zhong Warehouse 161,840 Butterfield &amp; Swire Warehouse 13,044</p>
<p>China Merchants North Warehouse 49,259 Yuanyi Warehouse 77,500</p>
<p>Yitaixing Warehouse 292,946 Hexing Warehouse 34,910</p>
<p>Hongsheng Warehouse 1,288 Butterfield &amp; Swire Huatong Warehouse 57,290</p>
<p>Ewo Shuntai Warehouse 20,000</p>
<p>Total: 1,164,719 bags</p>
<h3>Starch Market Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the starch market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month were generally firm. With the price of foreign wheat rising by about 50-60 cents, market sentiment was consistently bullish. Due to the upcoming delivery by traders this month, there were reportedly fewer warehouse receipts from each factory. Current sales in this area were still active. For future months, Northern merchants made small purchases in each session. The output of Fufu and Liang factories was very small, resulting in a good market atmosphere with gradual price increases. Watch for further consolidation. As a result, the price for this month increased by one cent compared to the previous day, September by 1.5 cents, October by 2.5 cents, November by 2 cents, December by 2.5 cents, and January by 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Show Weakness Near, Stability Far</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month showed weakness near and stability far. This month, due to delivery, traders with spot goods in the city gradually sold out, and buyers, apart from those who were prepared, did not have much confidence, leading to a very quiet market and a depressed opening price. For future months, the market sentiment was initially bullish due to the increase in the price of foreign wheat, but buying interest was limited due to the weakness of this month's prices, resulting in a slight decline. As a result, the price for this month fell by 4 cents compared to the previous day, September to November increased by 1 cent, and December increased by 3 cents. The spot wheat market was not active. Only Shaoxing wheat opened at 3.37 taels, then fell to 3.32 taels, totaling 1,300 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Handbags Shipped to Europe in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>▲ Xiangmao and others shipped over 800 pieces to England and France</p>
<p>The Da Er Wan Shou handbags produced in Shandong Province have traditionally been sold to French territories. Since new sales channels were discovered in London this spring, British mail ships have been shipping huge quantities to England every month. The British ship "Lunbotela" exported 620 pieces of silk factory handbags and flush factory handbags from Xiangmao, Baili and others in this port, bound for England, and 258 pieces to Lyon and Marseille.</p>
<h3>Sales of Foreign Firm Silk are Firm and Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in this port continued to be firm and smooth. Qianli and others imported 60 bales of Shanghai white grade B silk with 20-22 filaments and an evenness of 82-85 points at a price of 620-680 taels. They also imported 20 bales of Shandong yellow factory silk with 13-15 filaments at a price of 560 taels.</p>
<h3>Ping-Shui Green Tea Trade Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American sales of Ping-Shui green tea from Huzhou suddenly became brisk. A large group of traders transacted over 4,000 boxes. Pearl tea and Xiu Mei of various grades also sold over 1,000 boxes each. The trade was exceptionally prosperous, and the market price was slightly firmer. The market for Luzhuang Zhen Mei pearl tea remained unchanged. However, the market for Gongxi became slightly more active due to the opening of the Russian Cooperative Association.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Sales Sluggish, Prices Weak</h3>
<p>The trend of tinplate has become sluggish again in recent days. Because traders have not been procuring, and users are receiving less stock. Therefore, the market is quiet. The price standard has gone from firm to stable, and then to weak. Recent transactions have been few, and the market looks even more deserted. Prices have been subtly loosened. The estimated price of a 3x7-foot Red Island brand sheet is 98 cents, down 2 cents from before. Miscellaneous brands are 95 cents, down 2.5 cents from before. The 3x6-foot Red Island brand has also dropped from 85 cents to 82 cents, and miscellaneous brands are 80 cents. In recent days, the market openings have shown little interest from other groups, except for a slight amount of business from inland river and Yangtze River routes.</p>
<h3>Coal and Coal Transactions Return to Dullness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, coal transactions returned to dullness. The market opening saw only a few wholesale transactions of white coal by traders. Transactions of bituminous coal were exceptionally quiet. The total amount of coal delivered in the city was less than 1,000 tons. Selling prices have therefore weakened subtly. Datong lump coal fell by 1 cent, Jiawang Tongming fell by 2.5 cents, and Heishan Tong fell by 1.5 cents.</p>

<h3>Antiques and Buddha Statues</h3>
<p>Items such as porcelain, bronze, jade, calligraphy, paintings, satin, leather goods, and medicines, these ancient and peculiar objects, are indeed the crystallization of ancient Chinese culture and have a value worth preserving. In particular, the items stored in the Palace Museum are rare treasures and naturally have an absolute necessity for preservation.</p>
<p>However, these items are, after all, aristocratic playthings. As in the Qing Dynasty, officials who achieved high rank would buy a few quaint items to display, as a sign of their elegance. This trend did not completely disappear in the Republic of China. For example, a family with land, property, and spare money might think of buying a few antiques to play with. If they were struggling to make ends meet, with basic needs unmet, how could they even consider storing antiques?</p>
<p>"Don't sell ancestral property" is a saying for ambitious descendants. Looking at our country, we cannot protect a single part of our land, we cannot protect a single part of our sovereignty, and our national treasury is empty. How can we even talk about preserving our national essence? We might as well sell all the Palace Museum's antiques to develop industry or expand education, making use of waste. It would be killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>"Hiding treasures invites thieves" is a tried and true saying. The Palace Museum was recently accused of stealing and selling antiques. Although the details of the situation are not yet clear, the formulaic phrase "cause for concern, but no concrete evidence" has been used to death in our government documents. We don't need to pursue it for now. Even considering the preservation costs alone, we don't know how much is spent each year. We might as well cut the Gordian knot and sell everything to avoid attracting attention.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts by Songfu</h3>
<p>Many corrupt officials and bureaucrats at the end of the Qing Dynasty begged for mercy and wagged their tails, acting as strong slaves. Once a fake minister emerged, what was it like to taste it firsthand?</p>
<p>The plan to save the country is in my heart; don't just chant lofty slogans. Invisible resistance is a truly good strategy, better than a mighty army of 100,000 men.</p>

<h3>Overview of Aquatic Product Gelatin Production by Manqian</h3>
<p>Gelatin is made from the skin and bones of animals. However, the usual raw materials are land animals. Who knows that the scales, swim bladders, skin, bones, etc., of aquatic animals can all be used to produce gelatin? Now, I will introduce what I know to the readers of this publication:</p>
<p>Uses: Gelatin has extremely wide uses. Industry needs it directly and indirectly everywhere, such as in matches, sandpaper, papermaking, winemaking, painting, printing, woodworking, medicine, photography, platemaking, mounting, dyeing, leather making, weaving, object joining, specimen making, and clarifying for food, to name just a few of the most famous!</p>
<p>Composition: Elemental carbon 49%, nitrogen 18.3%, hydrogen 6.6%, oxygen, and sulfur 26.1%. As for the molecular formula of gelatin, it has not yet been determined. There are several kinds, such as Ci62Hi12iN3rO39, C76Hi124O39, and Ci2HioN2O4C35H37N3iO3. I don't know which is correct.</p>
<p>Raw Materials: Anything containing collagen can be used to make gelatin. Such as the skin of sea lions, seals, and cod; the bones of whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals; the bones of seals and cod; the shells of turtles; the scales of herring and sardines; the swim bladders of Miányú, carp, cod, yellow croaker, and small yellow croaker; the stomach membranes of seals and amberjack; and the gelatinous membranes of sperm whales are all very suitable and important raw materials!</p>
<p>Types: Aquatic products can be used to make several kinds of gelatin: skin gelatin, bone gelatin, scale gelatin, swim bladder gelatin, and liquid gelatin.</p>
<p>Outline of Gelatin Production Methods: (1) Fat extraction: There are three methods for this procedure: A, heating and dissolving in a sealed pot with a steam coil; B, pressure dissolving in an immersion vessel; C, solvent extraction using volatile solvents such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride. Of these three methods, A can obtain 5% fat, B can obtain 7% to 8%, and C can extract all the fat. Of course, C is now the most suitable. (2) Dissolving gelatin: This can be divided into four methods: direct heating, direct steam heating, indirect steam heating, and hot water heating. Among them, hot water heating is the most suitable because it does not apply excessive heat and can prevent damage to the quality, resulting in excellent products!</p>
<p>Discussion of Manufacturing Methods: (1) Skin gelatin: The order of manufacturing is hair removal (discarding waste skin), boiling of gelatin raw materials, purification of gelatin liquid, coagulation, and drying. (2) The bone gelatin manufacturing procedure has the following eight items: A, bone crushing; B, fat extraction; C, acid soaking; D, gelatin extraction; E, gelatin liquid clarification and bleaching; F, gelatin liquid concentration; G, coagulation; H, drying.</p>
<p>(3) Scale gelatin: The method for making scale gelatin is the same as for bone gelatin, but in the third step of acid soaking, the degree is often weaker than when making bone gelatin, so only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is needed. The gelling power is also relatively weak, so the boiling time and temperature should also be noted!</p>
<p>(4) Swim bladder gelatin: Before manufacturing, the swim bladder must be immersed in clean water to soften it, and then extraction can begin. The rest of the procedure is exactly the same as for skin gelatin.</p>
<p>(5) Liquid gelatin: The above are all solid gelatins. Adding about 5% carbolic acid alcohol solution to the gelatin liquid of scale gelatin and skin gelatin to weaken the gelling power will result in a liquid gelatin, which is called liquid gelatin.</p>
<p>What has been said above is just a very brief situation, really because of the limitation of space, it is no longer allowed to say more! If there are any questions, let's discuss them next time!</p>
<p>Improvement Society Discussion</p>
<h3>Discussion on Improving Tombs by Zhang Tong</h3>
<p>Mr. Xian Yunzong published the issue of "Improving Tombs" in your publication. The reasons he stated for improving tombs are indeed very poignant, but I cannot fully agree with his proposed methods of improvement.</p>
<p>The reason we want to improve tombs is to reduce consumption and increase production. Now, in the second article of Mr. Zhu Yunzong's proposed improvement plan, he says: "The government should designate areas to establish public cemeteries and order the people to bury their coffins in one place." May I ask, are the areas designated by the government not farmland? Are the people's coffins not money? In this view, Mr. Zhu Yunzong's method is probably not a very economical tactic.</p>
<p>I believe that the most economical method requires only the removal of the name "tomb" because with tombs, no matter how small the scope is, some land will always be occupied, and some money will always be consumed.</p>
<p>To require that no land be occupied and that some money be saved, there is only "cremation" because cremation has the advantages of (1) avoiding the expense of buying a coffin, (2) not costing any land to make a tomb, and (3) not having to waste time going to the tomb.</p>
<p>Cremation methods: (1) The government should set up a public cremation place, and order the people to go to that place to cremate their bodies. (2) The ashes after cremation are disposed of freely by the people. (3) If anyone still uses the tomb system, the government will dig up the tombs at any time and impose a fine.</p>
<p>Such a method can save a lot on "time," "money," and "land," and the "land" and "money" items can be used without expense, which is better than the "public cemetery system." (Thank you)</p>
<p>School Writing</p>
<h3>That Night of Farewell by Long Yu</h3>
<p>On that night of farewell, everything in the school seemed unusually lovely. I used to curse the so-called monastery walls day and night, but this night I saw them as palaces. Even the stench from the neighboring leather factory, which I always hated, seemed to contain some kind of unspeakable meaning. In this reluctance to leave, the dormitory building stood impartially, each room piled up messily. No one would have thought that just three days ago, it was called a model dormitory.</p>
<p>The residents of the rooms were limited by the rule that they were not allowed to run to other rooms, so they all had to come out to chat in the corridor. Some sat at the door of their rooms, some stood, and some even sat on the floor.</p>
<p>"Hey! You're so smug now that you have your diploma, but don't forget us."</p>
<p>Ping said, "Although the university campus is carefree, I prefer being in this monastery...:"</p>
<p>Ding-dong, ha-dong.</p>
<p>What second bell? My watch is still ten minutes to nine-thirty." Xin, his face flushed red, jumped up from the ground in anger. "Don't make noise. We've been talking for a long time. Of course, it's time. Let's go to sleep." Fang, who always obeyed school rules, said very seriously, "Okay, you'd better go to sleep quickly, or you won't be able to get up again."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the dormitory, which was full of life, was as lonely as death.</p>
<p>Suddenly a loud voice broke the loneliness, "Wake up, you! A-hui went to the movies and won't be home until twelve o'clock. Sesame and banana also went out...:"</p>
<p>Xin shouted like this, and one by one, people jumped out of their rooms upstairs and downstairs, some singing, some shouting. This kind of noisy sound was unprecedented in the school.</p>
<p>Who said A-hui wasn't home?</p>
<p>Zhao Ma said so. Although the light in her room was on, it was an empty city strategy.</p>
<p>"A-hui went to Nanjing to see a movie? I hope she meets something on the way...:"</p>
<p>"Don't be so blackhearted,"</p>
<p>"Look! Isn't that Cabbage Head and Big Nose on the grass?"</p>
<p>"Take care of them! They're not our dorm mother,"</p>
<p>Just as they were happy, someone shouted, "A-hui is coming." At this shout, everyone ran to their rooms as if they had been electrocuted. A-hui's small leather shoes could be heard, and A-hui was indeed coming. A-hui's footsteps were always too small, and she hadn't had the training to run like the students, so when she arrived, the dormitory was already silent. It was lucky that no one was caught by her, or else it would be five demerit points again.</p>
<p>It is said that A-hui did not go to see a movie, but went to a foreign teacher's house for dinner. That night, she came to check the rooms three times. The last time, she was wearing a pink nightgown. The students said that she looked a little scary in the moonlight.</p>
