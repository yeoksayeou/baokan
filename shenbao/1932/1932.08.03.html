<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">德國選舉結果與巴本内閣　華· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>在七月三十一日德國舉行總選舉以前。［巴本内閣蟬聯乎。仰國家社會黨領袖希德婁竟將上台乎。］此不僅爲各國人士之疑問。即在德國。亦莫敢作確切之豫言。今總選舉之結果已揭曉。此問題方得大白。</p>
<p>就選舉之結論。希德婁領導之國家社會黨。在國會六○七議席中。獲得二百二十九席。較前增加十　席。左派之社會民主黨得一百三十三席。較前减三席。共産黨得八十九席。較前增加十　席。希德婁派在國會中未得絕對多數。如左派聯絡。尙足與之相抗。希氏受選民公意之判决。已無上台秉政之可能。巴本内閣在選舉前。本欲消减左派勢力。同時亦不願希德婁派左國會佔絕對多數。此次選舉結果。依大體而論。適償所願。故於本月一日巴本特發宣言勸各黨互助。從事建設的立法。並預備一提案。要求授權政府實行經濟及行政改革。俟一月内新國會召集通過後實施。而國會或將於通過該案後休會半年。準是以觀。巴本内閣似可蟬聯矣。</p>
<p>上述問題。今已獲解。顧吾人對於德國此次選舉之結果。重有感觸者。約有二端。即（一）欲以力服人者。反必不爲人所悅服。（二）壓迫愈甚。被壓迫之勢力愈高。何以言之。國家社會黨近來勢力大盛瀰漫全國。在選舉前大有必得完全勝利之望。然該黨倒行逆施。濫用暴力。在各地造成許多慘案。羣情憤慨。認該黨應負擾亂之責。故其勢力。至七月三十一日投票時即已衰减。結果未獲絕對多數之議席。又巴本自上台以來。扶植右派勢力排斥左傾各派不遺餘力。自以高壓手段足使反對派從此一蹶不振。銷聲匿跡。詎選舉結果。共産黨議席竟有增加。出其意料之外。暴力與高壓手段。在實際政治上寗能獲得滿意之結果。</p>
<p>再就管見所及。更端略言德國於選舉後之内外形勢。就德之内政言。希德婁派本由德國一般不滿於現狀的羣衆集合而成。破壞有餘。建設不足。其失敗也。固非偶然。然而該派在新國會究屬佔有議席最多之一黨。議長將由該黨選出。在立法機關。願有勢力。却爲大堪注意之事實。巴本近稱共和憲法。需要修改。將來巴本果實行修憲必遭左黨反對無疑。今後德國立法機關。雖更右傾而左右兩派軋轢愈甚。殆成不可避免之事實。就德國對外而言。希德婁派對外向取强硬態度。今該派旣在國會擁有勢力。政府對外。自亦不能軟弱。况。巴本於選舉時。嘗向選民宣稱列强若不允德國軍備均等之要求。德將退出國聯。是就選舉後之形勢觀之。德國對外之不取妥協政策。殆可斷言。中歐與列國間。或因此增加糾紛。亦未可知。　者。有人推測希德婁派若得勢。德俄邦交必致破裂。因德國對俄將取攻勢。現德國共黨勢力亦增加。右派縱仇俄。但因國内多事。且有左黨之牽制。對俄恐未必敢輕舉妄動。俄國在歐陸方面。若無十分顧慮之必要。當有餘力以戒備遠東嚴重之形勢。故德國選舉後之國情。决非與東方局勢絕無關係也。</p>

<p>日本對華輸出貿易　東京通信　懷仁</p>
<p>從一九三一年九月以後、中日兩國間的邦交、已陷入瀕於斷絕的嚴重局勢之中、但日本依然是一步緊一步的往前進逼、而中國却是一步鬆一步的往後倒退、淞滬一戰、纔算挽回了若干已失去的面子、然而東北邊疆一隅、終於還是緊緊的把握在敵人的手中、</p>
<p>雖然、日本在軍事方面、固然以［幹蠻］、［硬幹］、［實幹］的信條、打中了中國人的弱點、而獲得了［意想不到之效力］、但在其他方面、也還是不能個避去若干的［不利］、我們失去了東北、是［國難］、日本獲得了滿洲、一樣也是［國難］、記者在不</p>
<p>久的過去、曾爲文論述過九一八事變後之日本財政、現在再就對華貿易來觀察九一八事變與日本的關係、</p>
<p>去年九月以降日本對華貿易金額表</p>
<p>輸出　　　對前年比較减增　　輸入　對前年比較减增</p>

<p>（備考）（十）爲增號　　從這個數字的記載、我們可以看出九一八以後的日本對華貿易、大體上是急轉直下、但實際這匆匆九個月之貿易、可以分成極明顯的兩個時期、從去年九月到十二月、是第一期、如這時期中、日本對華貿易、是站在絕對不利的地位、但從本年一月以後、衰微的日本對華貿易、重又步入於恢復期、</p>
<p>九一八後日本對華貿易第一期激减的原因、不消說是爲我國排貨所造成、但其第二期的轉旺、似不能全歸罪於我停戰協定後排貨之鬆弛、本年一月後、日本所積極進出於東北、當爲其最主要有力的原因、　　下面是一個極顯明的數字說明　　　　　　　對中國　　　　　　　對東北　　　　輸出　　　對前年增减　　輸出　　　　對前年增减</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚亞林匹克  瞻廬　　如火如茶的世界亞林匹克運動大會、第十届在美國洛山磯舉行：號稱亞林匹克克員國的中華民國、直到這一届，才有一位劉長春君加入；在那如火如茶中間、只好算火的一星、茶的一葉；五十餘國的旗幟飄揚裏面、總算靑天白日旗也在那裏一起兒飄揚；窮凶極惡的滿洲僞國、也想派着選手，請矮子做保鑣，到洛山磯去出出風頭！畢竟嘗了閉門羹，自討没趣。在這分上，我們中國人，也可略吐這一中悶氣。　一九二零年，在比國舉行第七届亞林匹克運動會，美國便派員聲請下届大會在洛山磯舉行，但是，會中已决定第八届在法京舉行，第九届在荷京舉行，輪到本届，才許在洛山磯舉行。所有亞林匹克村的建築，三年前便由人以數百萬美金承包，美輪美奐，說不盡的堂皇和偉大；聘請四十國的專門廚司，所備的入塲券，有十五種不同的色彩；貧弱的中國人，見人彼美人兮這般的排塲，怎不令人兩眼烘烘的熱，饞涎汩汩的流。　從前，没有中國選手加入大會，是我們放棄權利；無論怎樣地輪流開會，總輪不到我們中國來。現在，有了一位劉長春君，在世界運動塲下了一顆種子；將來，一而十，十而百，選手愈派愈多；總有一天，在吾國首都左近築起美輪美奐的亞林匹克村，歡迓世界選手，一决雌雄。這不是我說大話，事實上有可能性；只須政治上軌道！只須向着鍜鍊國民體魄的目標，努力進行！陳英士舊話  鄭逸梅　　陳英士之紀念塔。旣巍立於滬上方浜路口。茲北京路又以成立紀念堂聞矣。偉人之身前抱大無畏精神者。固當埀後人之景仰於永久也。客有與英士先生有舊者。爲述英士先生曩赴胡家弔奠。胡家固假壽聖庵爲喪幕者也。客與胡家爲葭莩親。亦往酬應焉。是日與先生同席。先生思想新頴。謂繁華都市中。不宜設爲清靜之佛地。此等庵觀。大可改築爲圖書館及名人紀念堂之用。同席聆之者。咸不以爲意也。不料事隔若干年。先生奮然而爲革命先進。功成身死。又隔若干年。竟將壽聖庵舊址。改爲陳英士紀念堂。且美輪美奐。與西門紀念塔。爲表揚勳蹟之二大建築物。當非先生生前意料之所及也。客又謂先生善說笑話。隣有楚人客死於寓者。楚人作狎邪游。斵喪殞命。死不足惜。然猶諱言爲水土不服。虧損失病。先生乃巧構一笑話云。一念佛嫗身上捉得一蝨。釋之則與已有切膚之痛。捫之則有背不殺生之戒。事出兩難。一再斟酌。遂置蝨於首部髮髻中。曰。釋之不可。捫之尤不可。不如任其水土不服而死也。聞者咸　噓不置。皖垣近聞  憶秋自皖寄　　三年前我曾寄生過半年的安慶。現在因事又舊地重臨、遍游兩日。得可記事四則。特錄投本談。　　野花撩亂飛。因爲安慶是省會。所以娼妓是一向和三月裏的野花般密密地開遍各處。那時的當局。不想禁而也無法可禁。後來索性聽其自然。因此。南京厲行禁娼以後。安慶的娼勢。驟然猖獗起來了。最近省會公安局新局長張本舜就任滿江紅　贈義勇軍  錢小山　　熱血噴空。莫撫事憂心如擣。是男子黃沙紫塞。從軍差好。壁上爭看揚漢幟。　中早撰平倭稿。指犬羊數已盡今年。張天討。　秦與越。長相保。家國恨。同時掃。把三千鐵弩。潮頭射倒。飲馬還須臨碧海。橫戈直欲登蓬島。待歸來笳鼓慶昇平。開懷抱。游歸元寺  曹夢魚　　漢陽城外歸元寺。經過琴台偶見之。甫入襌門參現象。便臨石沿瞰　　。萬千世界塵心化。五百尊嚴望眼遺。爲覓　經到方丈。　繙貝葉證菩提。以後的第一聲。就是厲行禁娼、近日各分局正在大捕娼妓。每天總有幾十個神女就逮。捉住了不是驅逐也境。就是禁押救　濟院。數會實堪驚人。昨日張局長特遍貼佈告。有［本人誓以禁娼成績優劣爲進退］句］可見其對於禁娼的决心了。　　江水上岸來　安慶是長八八九尺或一丈之一。向來江水距岸。總在八九尺或一丈以外。因爲地勢極高。就是去年閙水災時也等於没有波及。近來天又連日晴朗。不知何故江水會驟然急漲。招商輪埠一帶低窪之處。江水竟湧上岸來。眞是一件奇事。而本地各報都没有是項記載。建設當局也不曾注意及此。更使人奇之又奇了。　　新建的公園　安慶向來缺乏清游之地。就是當地稱爲名勝的菱湖。迎江寺兩處。也很平常。而且都離城極遠。眞是一個俗不可耐的地方。現在居然也建設了一個公園。因爲地居孔廟。所以定名爲孔園。裏面面積雖不大。布置倒還清幽宜人。尤其特殊的是四處都是花棚綠蔭。近日奇熱。每到傍晚。游人必接踵而至。裏面居然學了上海半淞園的局面。什麽冷食點心茶果一應俱全。的確替安慶爭了很多面子。　　黨員大活動　此間省黨部新宾改組。九位特派員到此以後。全埠各旅館同時宣告客滿。據調查此次專來活動黨務工作的。納二千人以上。眞是笑話。就是省黨部及全省各縣的舊員一律裁汰。也萬萬不能分配。所以近日這九位特派員。就被這二千以上的失業黨員包圍得氣都透不過來。大叫其苦。眞是一件可笑而復可嘆的事。玄武湖之夏  燧丞　　首都湖沼。以玄武湖爲最大。湖上有公園。綠樹參天。修篁遍地。樓臺水榭。曲徑相通。景緻幽雅。允爲逭暑最佳之所。每當夕陽西下。但見摩登女子。裙屐少年。紛至沓來。或湖上划舟。或園中品茗。藉消溽暑。惟薄暮湖水如湯。微風過處。熱氣中人欲昏。遊人不知。蕩槳才數里。感喛風之不適。仍棄舟登陸者。比比皆是。故遊湖者。宜先遊園。夜闌欲歸。然後駕舟。蓋此際湖中之水。熱氣蒸發已盡。扁舟一葉。容與中流。輕颶指衣。肌體生凉。迨登彼岸。而塵囂盡滌。暑熱已消矣。　　園中有售茗者。於桐蔭之下。叢竹之旁。隨意設座。不張燈火。而皓月照人。幽靜非常。以故三五之夜。座客無不常滿。但旣望之後。圓月漸缺。星光亦微。遊客雖多。而品茗者少矣。短訊  舍予　　　國産唱片公司大中華、久爲賞音者所贊許、該廠原雇有日人技師、自九一八後該公司解約辭其職、收音部分本有公司前總理許冀公君公子清海實習其間、盡得其秘、近已正式主持、并得一英籍猶太人台維爲助、出品不亞外片、吾友王壽岑君爲公司協理、謀發展之策、月前羅致彈詞家傑出者廣收說書摘錦等片、已有樣片播放於中西大藥房及國華無線電臺中、最近敎育部爲愼重國語、聘得專家在該公司留灌標準國語、派員來申、監視其事、王君且已預約相伯老人於秋季留其　頗、予本劇迷、犮人鄂呂弓許曉圃一擅鬚生、一能荀慧生腔、日前往各收音兩面、予爲操琴伴奏、據清海報告、成績極爲完美、然予爲初試灌音、拘謹處不免臨帖之譏、再益以電蓄不差毫黍、他日片成、將先藉電臺廣播、就正同好出版界消息　　名小說家張秋蟲君主編之［萬歲］雜誌。第一期已於八月一日出版。由本埠四馬路現代書局代發行。更目計有击瘦鵑章太炎汪仲賢范烟橋馬二先生張恨水張慧劍張靜廬張碧梧鄭逸梅等之短篇小說及雜作、更有何海鳴張春帆徐早呆張恂子張秋蟲之長篇傑作五種。復倩各畫家丁悚張光宇魯少飛黃文農葉淺予等逐篇精繪插圖。内容之豐富精美得未曾有。値得介紹之國貨工廠（一五）  何躬行　　（二五）機製捲煙盒工廠　　市上十支裝之小煙盒。銷用最繁。出貨亦速。可分二部。一盒殼部。一盒心部。盒殼製法（一）以印就商標之紙張。先以小切刀修齊。（二）上軋線車軋帶切成紙條。（三）上漿糊機。（用手工者亦有）（四）切盒殼。切盒殼用機器者·每日可切一百萬。用切刀者。每人每日可切七八萬。機器由一人司之。將已經漿糊成長條形之盒殼向機内推之。一方推進。一方由機下下落。　　盒心製法有大規模者。有小規模者。大規模者（一）先排刀。此項排刀工人。必須上等工人。工資往往有五六十元一月者。（二）上印切機。如須盒心上印字者該機可連印帶切再連軋盒心（三）用人工分拆盒心。（四）砂邊。（五）發女士一千張一紮。小規模者·除第二項手續須分做切印軋盒心三種手續外。其餘大致相仿。　　上項所謂大規模設備者。上海周家嘴路底。有善工機製煙盒廠。卽以此項手續製造。其機器係仿美式而改良自製者。每部日可出盒心二百萬個。善工有該項機器二部。除善工外。中國製煙盒廠中無第三部矣。該廠主亦非常人。可嘉也。至軋心車。每部日可軋盒心十萬個。所以籌設煙盒廠。非一二萬金不辦。規模大者。更非三四萬金不可矣。上海製造煙盒工廠。當然推善工最大。每千只工價洋三元有餘。至市同業十餘家。全年營業約計五十萬元。　　附來函關於美綸寛緊帶事逕啟者。頃閱本月二十九日。申報封面登載蘇州美綸寛緊帶廠啟事一則。誦悉之下。不勝惶惑。鄙人從事工商界十餘年。平時每感中國小工藝之不發達。致生産落後。有品多仰給外人。認謂爲中國工商業最大之厄運。欲謀挽救。非先將各種小工藝内容種種。詳加調查。以調查結果。貢獻國人。冀有志經營小工業者。得有參考。爰於一年前。卽從事調查各業工商概况。全調查手續。先至經營該業之領袖人前。以研究之方式。爲調查之入手。調查所得。再就正於該業之較大工廠。務必求其詳細確實。自問負有介紹之責。何敢以耳食之言。妄參末議。總以實在情形。撰爲報告。再行刊諸報端。至調查寛緊帶廠一則。亦係當時根據事實而來。蓋是項原料。確係外貨。而橡皮帶一項。雖有德貨意貨。而價格貴至一倍以上。故十九仍採用日貨。是並非指該廠一家而言。亦非指現在而言。試問九一八以前。該業所用之橡皮帶。究竟是否日貨。總之該業原料。目前確無國貨可以代用。將來能否研究發明。全在我工業界之努力。目前雖不用日貨。亦必須外貨是仰。鄙人對於該業原料之未有國貨。因生歎息之心。何嘗以該號用外貨原料。而有攻擊摧殘之意。今該號貿然以摧殘國貨罪名相加。未免太不擇辭。况彼此同在國貨業中服務。是不必斷章取義。斤斤於日貨與德貨之爭也。何躬行謹上古廟敲（六十三）  不除庭草齋夫　　七十　　中華民族之新生命是在工學團的種子裏潛伏着，我有這種認識，我有這種信仰，我願意做一個園丁將這種子遍撒人問。但是一粒種子必定要撒在適宜的土壤裏纔能發芽，抽條，開花，結果；若是撒在流沙上，豈不是流費了種子，虚耗了生命？現在一般的學校是不是歡迎這粒新種子？這粒新種子在學校裏能不能長成？一般的敎師可能做工頭？靑年學生們可能做工人？師生若不能做工，則工學團根本不能成立。工學團的名字也許是多數覺悟的智識分子所贊同，可是眞正要他們流汗的時候一到，長褂黨，旗袍黨，西裝黨，高跟皮鞋黨，雙料老爺太太。少爺小姐黨難免不羣起而反對牠，傳統學校是否能夠變成工學團有我心裏却是一個大大的疑問。　　一般的工廠是異途同歸的令我悲觀。平日工作時間是佔據了十二小時以上。身體疲乏得像害病一樣還能有餘暇去求長進嗎？况且現在工人是做了機器的奴隸，買盡勞動力而不得一飽，在極不平等待遇下，如何談得到互助？工學團能在這種園地裏發榮滋長嗎？中國的兵大多數是農人，但是聽了［當兵三年，不肯種田］的民謠不由人也要悲觀起來。今日之軍隊究竟有幾處能把工學團的力量發揮出來？商店裏一般的老板管事是不許夥計徒弟做學問。聽說以前都市裏推行平民敎育之最大的阴碍便是這般不懂事的人，他們旣反對平民敎育，難道偏要歡迎工學團嗎？　　我想到這裏是從樂觀降到悲觀，從希瑪拉雅山之最高峯沉到瑪麗娜海之最深處。　　工學團的種子有了；工學團的團地安在？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The German Election Results and the Papen Cabinet - By Hua <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Before the German general election on July 31st, the question of whether [the Papen cabinet would continue or if the leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, would ascend to power] was not only a question for people of various countries but also one that no one in Germany dared to predict with certainty. Now that the results of the general election have been announced, this question has become clear.</p>
<p>Based on the election results, the National Socialist Party led by Hitler obtained 229 seats out of the 607 seats in the Reichstag, an increase of 10 seats from before. The left-wing Social Democratic Party obtained 133 seats, a decrease of 3 seats. The Communist Party obtained 89 seats, an increase of 10 seats. Hitler's faction did not obtain an absolute majority in the Reichstag. If the left-wing parties unite, they could still resist him. Hitler's chance of coming to power and taking control of the government has been denied by the public will of the voters. Before the election, the Papen cabinet originally intended to weaken the left-wing forces while also not wanting Hitler's faction to occupy an absolute majority in the Reichstag. The result of this election, in general, fulfilled their wishes. Therefore, on the first of this month, Papen issued a declaration urging all parties to help each other and engage in constructive legislation, and prepared a proposal to request authorization for the government to implement economic and administrative reforms. These would be implemented after the new Reichstag convenes within a month and passes the proposal. The Reichstag may then adjourn for six months after passing the proposal. Based on this, it seems that the Papen cabinet may continue in power.</p>
<p>The aforementioned question has now been resolved. However, regarding the results of this German election, there are about two points that we feel deeply about: (1) Those who want to subdue others by force will inevitably not be liked by others. (2) The greater the oppression, the higher the power of those being oppressed. Why do we say this? The National Socialist Party has recently become very powerful and pervasive throughout the country, and before the election, it had great hopes of achieving complete victory. However, the party went against the tide and abused violence, creating many tragedies in various places. Public sentiment was indignant, and it was believed that the party should be held responsible for the disturbances. Therefore, its power had already declined by the time of the vote on July 31st. As a result, it did not obtain an absolute majority of seats. Furthermore, since Papen came to power, he has spared no effort to support the right-wing forces and exclude the left-leaning factions. He believed that high-pressure tactics were enough to make the opposition forces collapse and disappear from then on. However, the result of the election was that the Communist Party's seats actually increased, which was beyond his expectations. Can violence and high-pressure tactics really achieve satisfactory results in practical politics?</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on my limited observations, I will briefly discuss the internal and external situation of Germany after the election. Regarding Germany's internal affairs, Hitler's faction was originally formed by a general public in Germany who were dissatisfied with the status quo. They have more than enough destructive power but lack constructive ability. Its failure was not accidental. However, this faction is ultimately one of the parties with the most seats in the new Reichstag. The speaker will be elected by this party. Its power in the legislative body is a fact that deserves great attention. Papen recently stated that the Republican constitution needs to be revised. In the future, if Papen really implements constitutional revisions, he will undoubtedly be opposed by the left-wing parties. In the future, although the German legislative body will be more right-leaning, the friction between the left and right factions will be increasingly severe, and will become almost unavoidable. Regarding Germany's foreign relations, Hitler's faction has always adopted a tough attitude towards foreign countries. Now that this faction has power in the Reichstag, the government cannot be weak towards foreign countries. Moreover, during the election, Papen once declared to the voters that if the great powers do not agree to Germany's demand for equal military strength, Germany will withdraw from the League of Nations. Therefore, judging from the situation after the election, it can be asserted that Germany will not adopt a policy of compromise towards foreign countries. Disputes between Central Europe and the great powers may increase as a result. Furthermore, some people speculate that if Hitler's faction gains power, diplomatic relations between Germany and Russia will inevitably break down because Germany will adopt an offensive against Russia. Currently, the power of the German Communist Party has also increased. Although the right-wing hates Russia, due to many domestic affairs and the constraints of the left-wing parties, they may not dare to act rashly against Russia. If Russia does not need to have too many concerns about the European continent, it should have enough power to guard against the serious situation in the Far East. Therefore, the national conditions in Germany after the election are definitely not completely unrelated to the situation in the East.</p>

He told them that the national crisis is imminent and that they should step up their work and prohibit prostitution and gambling. Soldiers should be prepared to shed blood in an international war. Reporters also rushed to Dezhou to visit Han on the train. Han said that the results of the meeting were satisfactory and that the generals attending the meeting all firmly expressed their determination to unite and defend against the enemy. Zhang Jin is also working hard to cheer up, and Chiang is also in favor of war. He also instructed him to assist Zhang in maintaining North China. He advocated that only by being able to fight can one be able to defend, and only by being able to defend can one be able to negotiate for peace. As long as the national spirit does not die, even if the country is destroyed, it can be restored. He believed that at this time of national crisis, a great unity should be implemented, and former national elders should also be asked to take responsibility. Fortunately, this proposal was supported by everyone. However, in the future, the diplomatic policy towards Shandong Province should still be one of non-arrogance and non-humility, maintaining friendly and harmonious relations. If anyone invades our territory, we will respond with all our strength. Now that North China has united as one, previous rumors have ceased. Outside sources say that the meeting has other purposes, which is a rumor. Wu Ziyu also advocates resistance. There are also tense reports from Jehol in the last two days, and Peiping and Tianjin must also be paid attention to. He arrived in Jinan at 7:10, and various important people greeted him at the station. Han gave a speech, roughly the same as before, and said that as long as the national unity is good and the soldiers are able to fight desperately, even if the country is destroyed, it can be restored. North China is prepared. Shi Yousan, Ge Guangting, and others also came with Han. Shi said that he saw Zhang in Beiping and that at this time of national crisis, past events are like smoke, and they will not mention each other. He only hopes that North China can implement the decisions made at this meeting and unite to defend against the enemy. Li Shizeng passed through Jinan from Beiping on his way to Nanjing. He said that the rumors of discord between the northern and southern generals in North China have been debunked, and the phenomenon is very good. At noon, Ge Guangting went to Qingdao.

Many turned Red and possessed tens of thousands of rifles. There were Soviet government flags everywhere. This time, the First Division of Hu Zongnan's army launched a large-scale suppression. In addition to resolutely eliminating them by force, they also used political power. All previous actions of the army disturbing the local population were eliminated. Therefore, the farmers expressed sympathy. When attacking Huoshan, more than 3,000 farmers broke away from the bandit area and returned to help the division fight the bandits. Therefore, the bandit forces immediately disintegrated. They have all retreated to the west of the Pi River. The division is handling the aftermath of the bandit area and tracking down the remnants of the Communists, so that the military affairs of Anhui Province can come to an end as soon as possible.

<p>Serious Disturbances Occur in Königsberg</p>
<p>Prussian Acting Political Commissioner Declares Use of the Most Severe Means to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 1st - The government, holding pre-war concepts, now appears to continue to hold power. Berlin and the Rhineland have now returned to normal, but serious disturbances have occurred in Königsberg. A large number of police patrol the streets in armed vehicles, hoping to stop the continued conflicts between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Prussian administrative official Barratt has issued a warning that if anyone does not abide by the political truce, the government will take severe measures. The new parliament will convene on August 3rd, and there is much discussion about what will develop at that time. According to reliable sources, the Papen government hopes to obtain a majority of votes to implement a political program that is not overly restricted by party views. At the same time, it will temporarily not formulate a plan based on Papen's pre-election declarations, waiting for the electoral fervor to dissipate. This morning, the central party organ newspaper stated that the results of this election are of historical importance because they finally reject the fanaticism of party dictatorship. The German Daily News stated that the unanimous opinion of the right-wing parties is that the National Socialist Party must join the government. Democratic newspapers stated that the National Socialist Party's movement has now been restricted, and the Central Party should compromise slightly and accommodate the right-wing party government in order to curb the extreme actions of the National Socialist Party. The authorities also issued a warning that if newspapers continue to make remarks that incite resentment, their freedom of speech will be subject to more severe restrictions. The public regards the warning of Prussian administrative official Barratt as being directed at the Communist Party, implying that if they do not stop acts of violence en route, the authorities will declare the Communist Party an illegal political party.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - The election day has passed peacefully and more orderly than expected. The German president has issued another emergency decree, declaring a ten-day political truce, which has greatly calmed people's hearts. Today, Dr. Barratt, the acting Federal Administrative Commissioner of Prussia, issued a further announcement, declaring that maintaining public order is the most important task at present. From now on, it is necessary to truly abandon force and terror, respect the law, and not infringe on the sanctity of human life. Therefore, he warned the public that the government will not hesitate to use the most severe means to maintain order. No groups or individuals may engage in acts that incite bloodshed and terror, and newspapers may not use language that evokes readers' emotions. Violators will have their freedom restricted.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - Only six parties can fully enjoy parliamentary rights in the new parliament, namely the National Socialist Party, the National People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Bavarian People's Party, the Christian Center Party, and the Communist Party. In addition, the National Party, the Economic Party, and the Farmers' Party, which enjoyed this right in the previous parliament, can no longer fully enjoy parliamentary rights due to insufficient seats. Moreover, after the number of parliamentary seats increased from 577 to 608 today, the seating problem has become more difficult. Because the parliament building was built in 1894, at that time there were only 413 members. Later, it gradually increased to 466 in 1918, but now it has doubled, and the meeting hall feels cramped and cannot accommodate so many seats.</p>

Communist Suvor died from injuries. Xu Zi and other syndicalists were also attacked in their residences. Although the assassins were extremely well prepared in advance, several people from the Xu family were able to escape, which was very fortunate. The people of Königsberg are very frightened by this matter. The authorities have taken the courage to maintain order. The Iron Brigade has asked Congressman Larson to demand severe sanctions. The editorial department of the People's Daily in Königsberg is offering a reward of 1,000 marks to find the murderer.</p>

<p>Havas, Berlin, 1st - Although the National Socialist Party did not win in this election, it is generally believed that Hitler will not give up because of this. Yesterday, Hitler convened his party staff and held a meeting all night in the party's organ in Bavaria's capital city to discuss the situation, which did not end until this morning. It seems that important decisions have been taken. Hitler immediately dispatched his trusted Strasser, Goering, and Frank to Berlin to inform the government of the party's decisions. As soon as these three arrive in Berlin, they will immediately visit General Schleicher, the Minister of National Defense. Schleicher is now considered the key to all new political situations. According to reliable sources, Hitler's envoys will demand a fundamental transformation of the federal government, which will result in almost all power falling into the hands of the National Socialist Party. Papen should step down, and Hitler should appoint a prime minister to succeed him. The position of Minister of the Interior should also be filled by a member of the Hitler Party. However, General Schleicher will remain Minister of National Defense. Hitler declared in advance that he would not form any alliance with the Central Party. Therefore, the House of Representatives will not be convened. The National Socialist Party also demands control of Prussia. The form of this notification is equivalent to a letter of ultimatum. It is also heard that Hitler seems to have seriously warned General Schleicher that if his demands are rejected, the National Socialist Party will immediately launch a resolute attack on the government, and even Schleicher himself will not be spared. Although the source of this news is reliable, it should be treated with appropriate reservation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st - French newspapers today criticized the results of the German elections, saying that Germany is preparing to tear up existing treaties and restore its lost hegemony. The newspapers are of the opinion that the real victor is General Schleicher, the Minister of National Defense. This election is a victory for Schleicher's policies. As for the large number of seats won by the Communist Party and Hitler's failure to win an absolute majority, the French newspapers all consider them to be the striking features of this election competition. The French newspapers predict that the new German parliament will still be as uncontrollable as the old parliament. The Paris Daily News stated that the German parliament will enjoy purely theoretical power, while the National Defense Force will continue to exercise its dictatorial power.</p>

<p>Reuters, Rome, 1st - Italy initially expected that Hitler's National Socialist Party would win an absolute majority of seats in the new parliament. Now that the results of the German elections are contrary to their expectations, Italy is greatly disappointed. Italy welcomes the National Socialist Party because its主張多與汎繫主義相合 (its主張多與汎繫主義相合), and Italians believe that Germany must have a strong government. Public opinion here believes that a well-organized government of the National Socialist Party in Germany is of greater value, regardless of how assertive it is in foreign affairs.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - After each election ends, the leaders of each party and faction usually issue declarations, either stating the achievements of the past battles or explaining the reasons for the failure. Therefore, after the general election of the parliament is completed, each party also has a written announcement issued. In general, the wording is extremely cautious and peaceful. However, the declaration issued by Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party, has a uniquely tough attitude. He bluntly stated that the party has achieved a great victory, and all party members should sharpen their knives and wait for preparation for another effort. Hitler also issued a military order-style announcement, encouraging the members of the Stormtroopers. At the same time, the National Socialist Party headquarters also issued a notice expressing extreme satisfaction with the election results and stating that the party should immediately obtain the right to manipulate everything in the parliament, which the National Socialist Party must implement in the future and which other parties can no longer compete for. The Berlin organ newspaper of the National Socialist Party even stated that parliamentary government is not suitable for Germany because there are still Communist Party members in the parliament. Therefore, the cabinet should immediately implement special methods to list the Communist Party as an illegal organization. If so, the 89 Communist members of parliament can be eliminated with one stroke. Furthermore, a National Socialist Party newspaper demanded that the Papen cabinet immediately declare martial law throughout the country in order to engage in clearing up all enemy parties that obstruct the National Socialist Party's policies. Furthermore, the Democratic Party's organ, the Börsen Zeitung, published an editorial today, warning Hitler not to be too extravagant, because the National Socialist Party, with great effort, has only obtained the support of 37 percent of the electoral districts, and it is exhausted and cannot obtain an absolute majority.</p>

<p>No Different From a Declaration of War Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Paraguayan Congress Decides on General Mobilization</p>
<p>Reuters, Argentine Capital, 1st - Bolivian troops have occupied the Boquerón fort, a strategic area in the Chaco Forest of Paraguay. Therefore, there is now no difference from a declaration of war between Paraguay and Bolivia. According to Bolivia, Paraguay first started the war and attacked twice, so Bolivian soldiers occupied two Paraguayan forts in retaliation. Bolivian tycoon Patiño, known as the Tin King of South America, has donated 15 military aircraft and millions of pounds in cash for the government's war preparations. Although the clouds of war are now dense, all parties are still working hard to mediate, hoping to avoid a split. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile have jointly advised both governments to cease hostilities and accept the mediation of neutral countries, and have suggested establishing a temporary neutral zone in the disputed land. According to news from the Paraguayan capital, Paraguay has telegraphed the League of Nations, stating that Bolivia has violated Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. At the request of the President, the Paraguayan Congress has decided on general mobilization. The armies of Bolivia and Paraguay are very small. Paraguay's standing army has a total of 2,905 people, and Bolivia's standing army has a total of 3,977 people. However, if the war expands, the standing army will not be difficult to expand.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st - Bolivia has rejected the proposal of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile and is unwilling to submit the dispute between it and Paraguay to neutral country mediation. The situation between the two countries is therefore becoming increasingly worse.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bolivian Capital, 2nd - It is heard that there are now more serious wars between Bolivia and Paraguay. Outposts of the two countries have repeatedly clashed in the past few days, mostly occurring near the forts in the Chaco Forest. It is now heard that there have been continued clashes in Toorita. Eight Bolivian soldiers and nine Paraguayan soldiers were killed, and both sides suffered some injuries. The public expects Bolivia's mobilization to be completed by August 6th, at which time it will declare war on Paraguay.</p>

The British Emperor was represented by his Crown Prince, together with the President of France, to preside over the opening ceremony. The British Crown Prince flew to France yesterday. President Lebrun, together with Prime Minister Herriot, Minister of Justice Loulou, Minister of War Pongou, British Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell, and others, departed from Paris by special train at 11:00 AM. Thiepval is a small village in the Somme region. During the war, the battle there was extremely fierce, and the entire village was destroyed. There are now only 32 residents, but today countless cars came from France, England, Belgium, and other places to pay their respects to this towering new Arc de Triomphe, beneath which is a plain of green. The cemetery of British soldiers who died is located there. The British Crown Prince, wearing the deep yellow uniform of a Colonel of the Imperial Guard, arrived first. The French President also arrived shortly after. Even in the rain, the President took off his hat and, with members of the cabinet, passed along the road between two rows of light cavalry. The British Crown Prince welcomed the French President and members of the cabinet under the memorial, and introduced the representatives of various autonomous territories and the generals who commanded the British Fourth and Fifth Armies in the Somme during the European War to meet with President Lebrun. The public then went to sit on the platform erected near the memorial. The memorial is 50 meters high and is engraved with the names of 73,000 soldiers who died in the Somme. Above it is written [Britain, for the British and French forces, erected this monument, [This Zhi Xie Chen]]. After prayers were held for the soldiers who died there, the British Crown Prince went to the podium and paid tribute to the French President in pure French. Then he switched to English to give a speech, which was immediately broadcast by radio to various overseas autonomous territories in England.</p>

<h3 id="e70">After the September 18th Incident <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Japan's Export Trade to China - Tokyo Correspondence - Huai Ren</p>
<p>Since September 1931, the relationship between China and Japan has fallen into a serious situation bordering on severance. However, Japan is still advancing step by step, while China is retreating step by step. The Battle of Shanghai managed to regain some of the lost face, but the corner of the Northeast frontier was ultimately firmly held in the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>Although Japan, in military terms, has hit the weak points of the Chinese with the creed of ["hard work"], ["brute force"], and ["practical work"], and has obtained ["unexpected effects"], it still cannot avoid some ["disadvantages"] in other aspects. We lost the Northeast, which is a ["national crisis"]. Japan's acquisition of Manchuria is also a ["national crisis"]. The reporter, in the not too</p>
<p>distant past, wrote about Japan's finances after the September 18th Incident. Now, let's observe the relationship between the September 18th Incident and Japan's trade with China.</p>
<p>Table of Japan's Trade with China Since Last September</p>
<p>Exports　　　　Increase/Decrease Compared to Previous Year　　　　　Imports　　Increase/Decrease Compared to Previous Year</p>
<p>(Thousands of Yuan)　　　　　　　　　　　　(Thousands of Yuan)Last September　22,992　　　　　-34.7%　　　　　　14,310　　　　　+6.9%October　　　　15,089　　　　　-59.7%　　　　　　15,447　　　　　-1.6%November　　　　10,425　　　　　-68.0%　　　　　　16,065　　　　　+0.5%December　　　　11,255　　　　　-63.9%　　　　　　19,971　　　　　-4.3%This Year January　11,520　　　　　-48.5%　　　　　　21,389　　　　　+7.0%February　　　　14,144　　　　　-30.6%　　　　　　20,404　　　　　-5.6%</p>

<p>(Note) (+) indicates increase. From the record of these figures, we can see that Japan's trade with China after the September 18th Incident generally declined sharply. However, the actual trade in these hasty nine months can be divided into two very distinct periods. From September to December last year was the first period. During this period, Japan's trade with China was in an absolutely unfavorable position. However, from January this year, the declining Japanese trade with China re-entered a recovery period.</p>
<p>The reason for the sharp decline in Japan's trade with China in the first period after the September 18th Incident was undoubtedly caused by our country's boycott of Japanese goods. However, the rebound in the second period cannot be entirely attributed to the relaxation of the boycott after our ceasefire agreement. Japan's active advance into the Northeast after January this year should be its most important and powerful reason. The following is a very clear numerical explanation:　　　　　　　To China　　　　　　　　　To Northeast China　　　　　Exports　　Increase/Decrease Compared to Previous Year　　　Exports　　Increase/Decrease Compared to Previous Year</p>

<h3 id="e71">Reception for Northern China Generals by Various Groups in Beiping <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Generals Deliver Passionate Speeches; Petition Group Holds Delegate Assembly.  Beiping Dispatch: Yesterday at 1 p.m., eleven groups, including the Beiping Bankers' Association, the Beiping General Chamber of Commerce, the China Fundraising Association for National Salvation, the China National Customs Society, the Civil Constitution Advancement Association, the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Association, the Journalists' Association, the National Crisis Relief Association, the Yiyou Society, and the National Salvation Association, held a reception at the Bankers' Association for Northern China generals and military and political leaders.  Generals attending included Zhang Xueliang, Han Fuqu, Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Tan Guoyuan, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Qun, Wu Peifu, Zhang Zongchang, Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and Wan Fulin—fourteen in total.  More than twenty representatives from various groups attended.  Around noon, they took their seats.  After taking their seats, Xiong Xiling delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the groups, stating that Japan annihilated Korea and then annihilated the Northeast.  China is currently in a critical period of peril.  If we want to survive, all generals must unite to resist foreign aggression and jointly save the situation.  Next, Central Committee member Zhang Qun delivered a speech, stating that his mission in coming to the north this time had two points: (1) to convey the intentions of the central government, and (2) to investigate the situation in northern China.  He hoped that all national mass organizations and military and political leaders would unite to assist the government in jointly resisting insults.  Next, Han Fuqu, Chairman of Shandong Province, delivered a speech, stating that Chinese soldiers in the past had all fought each other.  The Northeast has now been lost.  The country is in such a critical state that soldiers should uphold their natural duty to defend the country and the people and unite to resist foreign aggression.  Next, Wu Peifu delivered a speech, asking all generals to unite to maintain Chinese culture.  Later, representatives such as Ding Jin of the Yiyou Society, Wang Bosui of the National Crisis Relief Association, Huo Weizhou of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association, and Wang Zhenwu of the Civil Constitution Advancement Association delivered speeches one after another.  The photo session and adjournment began around 4 p.m.  Furthermore, the Beiping Groups' National Salvation Joint Association had previously resolved to petition Zhang Xueliang, with officials and civilians cooperating.  Recently, representatives from the Tianjin Student Union arrived in Beiping, and they jointly organized the [Beiping-Tianjin Groups' Representative Petition Delegation].  The delegation held a delegate assembly at Zhongshan Park yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m.  They resolved to go to the Shuncheng Wangfu (Prince Shuncheng's Mansion) to petition.  They then formed a procession and set off, holding high a horizontal banner with the words [Beiping-Tianjin Groups' Representative Petition Delegation].  Each representative held a small flag and distributed a petition declaration along the way.  At 4:10 p.m., they arrived at the Shuncheng Wangfu.  After conveying their notification, Qin Hua, counselor of the Beiping Pacification Commissioner's Office, met with them outside the second gate because Zhang was unable to meet with them due to his visit to the French embassy.  The representatives presented the petition outline and other materials and stated the purpose of the petition and their determination to meet Zhang.  Qin Hua negotiated with the representatives several times.  Finally, Qin said that the views of the group were not necessarily different from those of Chairman Zhang, and that Chairman Zhang's views might even be more advanced than those of the group.  The fact that various generals have come to Beiping can prove this.  He hoped that the group would return temporarily and that all matters could be conveyed by him.  At 7 p.m., as a result of the negotiations between the two sides, the petition group left 20 representatives to wait for a meeting with Zhang Xueliang at the Shuncheng Wangfu, while the rest dispersed.

<h3 id="e72">Legislative Yuan Passes Import Tax Increase Bill <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Annual Revenue Increase of 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of July 30th, the "Customs Collection of Additional Tax and Increase in the Types and Rates of Import Tax" bill submitted by the Central Political Council was passed in its entirety. The original proposal of Finance Minister Song Ziwen to the Central Political Council and the list of goods and tax rates for the increase in import tax by customs are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Original Proposal of Song Ziwen: Song Ziwen's original proposal to the Central Political Council stated: "To submit a request, since the Shenyang Incident, the customs tax revenue of the eastern provinces has been completely and forcibly extracted. Moreover, due to the floods last year and the Shanghai War this spring, customs duties have been greatly affected. Until recently, the actual customs revenue received in July of this year was insufficient to pay the domestic and foreign debts and reparations due, with a shortfall of more than 3 million yuan. Such a shortfall in customs revenue is unprecedented, and with the national crisis continuing, it is feared that there will be little hope of improvement in the near future. In this extraordinary period, in order to maintain national credit and national financial stability, it is necessary to carefully plan emergency measures. After repeated discussions, the only option is to implement the following measures immediately to alleviate the financial difficulties: (A) The disaster relief surcharge, from August 1st of this year, should be collected at 5% of the customs duty rate in accordance with the original regulations. Now, in order to alleviate financial difficulties, an additional surcharge of 5% of the customs duty rate will be collected for a period of one year. (B) Increase the import tax on the following items: (1) Rayon, increase by 10 gold units per picul; (2) Rayon and silk finished products, increase by 15%; (3) Aniline dyes, increase by 10%; (4) Synthetic indigo, increase by 2 gold units per picul; (5) Medicines, increase by 5%; (6) Toys and games, increase by 17.5%; (7) Alcoholic beverages, increase by 30%, including the current wine tax; (8) Goods not listed in the tariff, increase by 2.5%. If there is no unexpected impact on import commerce, the above-mentioned additional tax is estimated to generate an annual revenue of 10 million yuan. The proposed increase in import tax is estimated to generate an annual revenue of 10 million yuan as well, for a total annual revenue increase of approximately 20 million yuan. If this can be implemented accordingly, customs revenue and commerce should not be affected in any way, and the financial situation can be slightly improved. A detailed list of the goods with increased import tax is attached for public deliberation." Song also stated verbally that in order to facilitate implementation, he hoped that the proposal could be discussed and implemented before August 1st. The proposal was subsequently reviewed by the Financial and Economic Groups of the Central Political Council. As a result, Item 1 of Section B was changed to increase rayon by 15 gold units per picul, and Item 2 was changed to increase rayon and silk finished products by 25%. A third item was added to increase raw silk by 30%.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Recent Situation in the Min-Gan-Yue Border Area Bandit Suppression <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The communist bandits' invasion of northern Guangdong has failed, and their main force has retreated to their old nests in Huichang, Ruijin, and Yudu. The bandit suppression army of Guangdong Province is determined to cooperate effectively with the central government and the Hunan-Jiangxi armies, dividing into two columns, preparing to directly encircle and suppress the bandits. In the future, the main battle will undoubtedly trend towards the intersection of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. Currently, the Jiangxi bandits are also active in western Fujian. The Red bandit's 12th Army under Luo Binghui's command in Changting, on July 15th, invaded Yongding Kanshi and Longtan. The local militia fought against the bandits based on their fortifications. However, due to being outnumbered, they were defeated by the bandits. The local militia in Xiayang Zhongkeng and other places, seeing the ferocity of the bandits, did not dare to resist and fled into the mountains. Luo's bandits then advanced straight into Zhongkeng, the hometown of Hu Wenhu of Yong An Tang. The local militia there numbered about 1,000, with sufficient guns and cannons, but they also did not dare to resist the bandits and retreated to the border area of Sixian and Datian County Hutousha in Guangdong. The bandits destroyed the militia fortifications, burned civilian houses, and kidnapped about 2,000 to 3,000 refugees, imprisoning them in Chen Dong Township. Since the 20th, Fujian refugees have fled into Datian County in Guangdong Province. The county magistrate, Liang Ruogu, seeing this situation, telegraphed Huang Yanzhen, commander of the 7th Division of Meixian, for help, as the county had only two battalions of troops stationed there, and their forces were weak. Huang immediately dispatched Luo Zhichun of the Training Corps on the 25th to Datian to defend the area. Because of this, rumors inevitably arose. Furthermore, the regiment of Zhong Junfang, commander of the 2nd Independent Division stationed in the city, besieged the bandits in Huangtian, Xunwu, on the 18th. The Red bandits there, consisting of the 8th Regiment and the Red Guards, numbering 600 to 700, retreated towards Huangxiang on the 21st, disturbing our Xuxi, and engaged Zhong's regiment until noon. The bandits were defeated and fled towards the Hejiao area. The above is the situation on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border. Secondly, several hundred Red bandits under Gu Dacun's command are lurking in the mountains of Jiulongzhang, Houdong, Yangxikeng, etc., making counter-revolutionary propaganda speeches everywhere and oppressing the villagers to join the Red ranks. This is truly a disaster for the heartland of Chaozhou and Meizhou. The various armies are currently planning to advance and suppress them, and the local police forces of each county have also re-established joint defense and stepped up their work. The bandit suppression situation currently seems to be gradually improving. Once the central government armies are completely concentrated and the 19th Route Army arrives in western Fujian, the Red bandits will have no ability to invade.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Welcome to the 19th Route Army by All Sectors in Shizhong <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Red Bandits Fled at the News</p>
<p>Shizhong Dispatch: All of the 5th Regiment of the 120th Brigade of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army arrived in Heshi yesterday, the 25th, from Longshan, and arrived in Shizhong this morning. Those who went to Lezhi Pavilion to welcome them included the deputy leader of the security team, Lin Xiantang, the deputy leader Xie Yangqiu, and representatives from various agencies and groups, Shizhong Public School, the Boy Scout</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Corps, Long　Public School, Dunzhu Public School,　　　Public School, etc. More than 1,000 students from various schools. At around 10 o'clock, the Commander Zuo Xun personally led all the officers and soldiers of the regiment to arrive, and the discipline was very strict. Commander Liang, dressed in a gray military uniform, was very sincere in his attitude and shook hands with each of the welcoming representatives as a courtesy. He frequently smiled and nodded to the welcoming people and young students and said, "You should treat me as a Shizhong person, not as an outsider, and don't be polite. We need to realize cooperation between the military and the people," etc. Slogans of welcome were posted everywhere, colorful and eye-catching. All agencies, schools, and civilian houses and shops along the way flew flags and banners to show their welcome. When Commander Liang and the welcoming representatives from all walks of life walked along Sucheng Road and Baoan Road to the security team's office, firecrackers exploded and cheers rang out, showing the enthusiasm of the people at that time. The regimental headquarters is located at the Dazhong Academy on Sucheng Road. Commander Liang, Deputy Commander Zhong, and Deputy Commander Tan rested briefly at the security team's office, and then Deputy Commander Lin Xiantang accompanied them to the regimental headquarters. Commander Liang inquired in detail about the bandit situation in the vicinity. The regiment has more than 2,500 people in total. After arriving in Shizhong, they went to various mountain passes to deploy defenses to replace the security team, allowing them to rest temporarily. The Red bandits in the Longtan Tiandi area, upon hearing that the 19th Route Army had arrived in Shizhong, retreated to Changliu Kanshi, leaving only a few local Red bandits in that area. The bandits in Shanpingtou also retreated to Hexi, and the bandits in Juzhou also retreated to Lantangkang. The Red bandits in Iwaki City have not dared to stay in the city for long in recent nights. Currently, the areas of Hexi, Wangzhuang, and Zhanglai are heavily guarded, but the situation is very panic-stricken. (July 26)</p>

<p>Breaking a Local Opium Smuggling Case and Escorting Suspects to Songjiang: Tinglin Town in Punan County is a prosperous commercial center, but it is rife with gambling and opium, and there are also harmful drugs in circulation, which are a scourge to society. Huang Xinyi, chief of the First Public Security Branch in the area, recently received reports that Liu Qiugen, the owner of a certain pharmacy, was engaged in opium smuggling and was making a thriving living. He sent police officers to search the premises, and they found two large pieces of opium weighing more than 40 taels in the shop. Liu Qiugen was arrested and escorted to the county Public Security Bureau for preliminary interrogation, and then transferred to the county court for questioning. It is reported that the prosecutor's office pre-trialed the case, and the defendant denied smuggling opium, claiming that it was deposited by others, etc. He is currently detained in the detention center for verification.</p>

The people of the four villages, in order to seek self-defense, are expanding the original security regiment to supplement the insufficiency of the police force, but they are suffering from a lack of funds. Subsequently, after public discussion among the local people, a Zhejiang opera troupe was invited to Taicang to perform, and the surplus funds would be used to recruit members and purchase firearms for the security regiment. July 31st was the sixth day of the performance in Shatou Town. Just as the performance was about to begin, some people intended to enter the theater without purchasing tickets. The organizers advised them to desist, but to no avail. They swarmed into the theater, causing public anger and leading to conflicts. More than ten spectators, including Wang Bingkun, were beaten and injured, and order was immediately disrupted. Fortunately, the Hewei Regiment made great efforts to mediate, and the storm was finally calmed.</p>

<p>Implementing the Dredging Plan: In recent years, due to geographical changes and upstream erosion in the Yangtze River channel, the downstream areas, such as Zhenjiang and Jiangyin, have seen increasing accumulation of sandbars in the river's center, hindering navigation. The central government established a Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee, but due to financial constraints, construction has been delayed. In Zhenjiang, for example, sandbars are scattered everywhere in the river's center, and many areas along the riverbank are also silted up, preventing small steamers and boats from docking. This is a major obstacle to transportation. Zhenjiang has formed a River Dredging Committee, organized by the Chamber of Commerce, Shipping Association, Water Conservancy Bureau (now joined by the Construction Department), and Construction Bureau, to plan the dredging of the river channel. The funding for implementation comes from surcharges on small steamer passenger tickets. It is reported that more than 70,000 yuan has been collected to date (but half should be allocated for the use of administration). The committee also recognizes that the silting of the river beaches is becoming increasingly serious and should be dredged as soon as possible. It has already purchased a dredger and is engaged in dredging. It is estimated that the entire project along the river will take about three months to complete.</p>

<p>Measures for Punishing Concealment of Land Taxes: The Zhejiang Provincial Government considers land tax revenue to be an important part of the province's income. The annual regular tax, surcharges, and special donations amount to approximately 9 million yuan. Although the province's land has not been fully surveyed, it is estimated that the total amount of land tax concealed, evaded, and in arrears is approximately 20 million yuan. To improve revenue and replenish the provincial treasury, a research group was organized, and a committee for recovering old debts was established to vigorously rectify the situation. The following measures for punishing people in Zhejiang Province who conceal land and evade land taxes were specifically formulated: (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the punishment for the concealment of cultivated land taxes by individuals or groups shall be handled in accordance with these measures. (2) If any of the following circumstances exist and the relevant government agency issues a public notice but the land tax is still not paid or the transfer of ownership is not reported after the deadline, the land shall be confiscated: 1. Those who have defaulted on land tax for years and refuse to pay; 2. Those who inherit land but do not complete the transfer of ownership and pay land tax in accordance with the regulations or have no land deed; 3. Those who own land with or without land tax but conceal it and do not report it. (3) Land confiscated by a government agency in accordance with the preceding article shall be evaluated and sold by the competent tax authority. After deducting the amount of land tax owed over the years from the land price, the remaining amount shall be allocated to local education and autonomy projects. The distribution method will be determined separately. (4) If a land without land tax is discovered as a result of a report, 20% of the value of the confiscated land may be given to the informant. If it is reported by a tenant farmer or farmer and confirmed, the original informant may be granted the right to manage and pay the land tax without compensation. (5) If a person voluntarily reports land with or without land tax to the competent tax authority and it is verified that there is no fraud or other entanglement, he or she shall be allowed to pay the land tax from the date of the voluntary report at the ratio of the nearby farmland tax rate, and the past shall be exempted from prosecution.</p>

<p>Bandits from Sheng County Burn and Loot Wangxiewan: Wangxiewan, located in the fourth district of Shaoxing and bordering Sheng County, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen bandits from Sheng County a month ago. They attempted to kidnap Zheng Jinshun's young son, but Zheng was alerted and escaped through the back door. The bandits suspected that he had fled to Zheng Hailin's house next door. Because the doors were tightly closed, they could not enter, so they set the house on fire to vent their anger. The area mainly consisted of thatched huts, and once a fire started, it could not be contained. It spread to more than 30 households. The Director of the Public Security Bureau arrived at the scene of the incident on the 31st to investigate and ordered the village chief to report the affected households for relief purposes.</p>

<p>A Boat Robbed at Sanjiangkou: On the night of the 29th, a boat sailing from Zhuji to Xiaoshan, fully loaded with groceries, rice, wheat, and four passengers, was en route to Yiqiao. Suddenly, it was met by a pirate ship coming head-on. As soon as it reached the boat, six bandits armed with quick-firing guns jumped aboard and looted everything. Five foreign letters, 120 yuan in foreign currency, six catties of white silk, and more than ten catties of tea were taken away. The bandits also searched the passengers, taking more than 70 yuan in large and small silver coins and a gold ring. As dawn approached, they fired a warning shot, disembarked, and fled north.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Quarrel, Both Die: In Yantou near Qianqing in the eastern township of Xiaoshan, a farmer, Zhu Zuqi, asked his wife, Wang, to hire workers from her mother's family because the weather was hot and the fields were dry. Unexpectedly, when Wang returned from her mother's family on the 30th, no one could be hired. As a result, the couple began to quarrel. During the night, Zuqi, in anger, beat his wife. Unexpectedly, the blow hit a vital point, and she died on the spot. On the morning of the 31st, her husband regretted what he had done and drowned himself in the pond in the backyard. He left behind one son and two daughters, all of whom were young. Their cries for their mother and father were heartbreaking.</p>

<p>(Electric Communications News Agency, Los Angeles, 1st Dispatch) The results of today's 100m final are: 1st: Tolan (USA) 10.3 seconds (New Olympic Record)</p>
<p>2nd: Metcalfe (USA) 3rd: Jonath (Germany) 4th: Simpson (USA) 5th: Toerien (South Africa) 6th: Yoshioka Ryuto (Japan) 10.6 seconds (Electric Communications News Agency, Los Angeles, 1st Dispatch) In today's schedule, the 100m final, which attracted the most attention, was, as generally expected, won by the American black athlete Tolan (also translated as Turen). The American flag was raised again on the central flagpole. His results are as follows:</p>
<p>1st: Tolan (USA) 10.3 seconds (Olympic Record) 2nd: Metcalfe (USA) 3rd: Jonath (Germany)</p>
<p>The Competition Process: The course of this fierce battle is roughly as follows: The American starter made two corrections to the start, and the race did not start until the third time. Japan's Yoshioka had an excellent start and led the way in the first 40 meters. At 50 meters, they were neck and neck, forming a single group. At 70 meters, Yoshioka fell to fourth place, and his final sprint did not go as planned. He finished sixth, one meter behind fifth place. According to external criticism, he sprinted too hard in the first half, making it difficult to continue later. Yoshioka, who finished sixth and earned one point, told reporters, "Both the semi-final and the final were difficult. I am very disappointed with the track. The starting method should be ideal, but at 70 meters, I was overtaken by those behind me. Perhaps it was due to the difference in physical strength, and I could not recover. I am very disappointed."</p>
<p>Electric Communications News Agency, Los Angeles, 1st Dispatch: Today's 100m final was the most exciting for the audience, and the competition was extremely fierce. Tolan (USA) and Metcalfe (USA), two black athletes, are both world record holders with 10.2 seconds, so the competition was very intense. At 50 meters, the two passed Yoshioka (Japan), Jonath (Germany), Simpson (USA), 球佩尔脱 (South Africa), and other athletes. Finally, Tolan won, only two inches ahead of second-place Metcalfe.</p>
<p>Equals World Record: Los Angeles, 1st - Special Dispatch: The 100m final was held at 3:00 PM. The center of attention for this final was to see to what extent the Japanese athlete Yoshioka could compete with Tolan and Metcalfe. After the gun fired, Yoshioka sprinted extremely well and maintained this momentum until 30 meters. However, from the 50-meter mark, his physical strength gradually declined, and he fell to last place at 90 meters. In the end, Tolan (USA) won first place with a time of 10.3 seconds, equaling the world record.</p>
<p>Results of the 100m Semi-Final: Los Angeles, 1st - Special Dispatch: The final preliminary round of the 100m was held today. After the start, Japanese athlete Yoshioka charged forward fiercely, followed by American star Tolan. Yoshioka and Tolan were one meter apart. Everyone expected Yoshioka to take first place. However, at the 70-meter mark, Tolan made an amazing effort and caught up with Yoshioka.</p>

<p>Fluctuations of Six Taels Throughout the City: Gold price continued its decline in yesterday's trading, with a fluctuation of six taels, but no major movements. By day's end, it fell by four taels. The sentiment among traders was weak, with supply exceeding demand. Initially, the silver market rose against the British pound and the US dollar, causing exchange rates to increase. The market opened lower but experienced temporary advances and retreats. The foreign exchange market remained unchanged on the surface, but internally it loosened. Particularly, the widespread selling by major players caused prices to decline further. It eventually dropped to the 740-tael mark. The market then rose slightly by a little over two taels due to purchases by Guangdong merchants. However, exchange rates stabilized. Rumors circulated that a certain bank had received 4,900 cash bars.

Ji Yuan Maoyong Yifeng Yong Hengxing Heng Yu Hengxing Yuan Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Tong Taichang Yuan Taifeng and the items set their heads were selling. The price of gold fell by 5 taels until 11:15, which was 40 taels, especially as HSBC sold September US dollars to Datong for 30 yuan. This month, the price was 875, and the British gold sold half the British gold to Citibank from the British Gold in September. Within one hour, the price rose slightly by several cents. At this time, Hengxing entered at a limited price, and the price rose again to 41 taels. Zhifeng Yong sold out, so the afternoon closed at 40 taels and 2 cents.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Was Relatively Stable: The afternoon market opened at 40 taels. Hengxing was the first to enter, followed by Yifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Tong Taichang Zhifeng Yong Heng Yu, etc. The price gradually increased by more than two taels, and at 3:00 it was 42 taels and 4 qian.

The afternoon market was from 77 taels to 74.5 taels, which was more pressed by four taels than before the closure (July 30) because the US dollars did not change and the price of gold had decreased slightly. The accounting has been balanced for the first time yesterday for August and September.</p>
<p>It was calculated at 40 taels, 38 taels for the replenishment, and 40 taels in the afternoon, so the short sale of the swap wanted to add some cents, but there was no transaction.</p>

<p>Yuan Cent Continues to Fall by a Small Cent... Silver Loan Early Rise and Afternoon Decline</p>
<p>The market is calm and the situation is quite good. Yesterday, the market opened and transactions were still calm, but the situation was very good. Due to the opening and closing of banks, various settlement receipts and end-of-month settlements are combined, so the procedures are unusually complicated, and the inflow and outflow of silver related to various incidental relationships is bustling. In terms of silver root, the supply and demand can be circulated because of the actual head-to-head difference, so there are more interbank lending transactions, and the need is better than that of foreign silver.</p>
<p>Yuan Cent Continued to Fall and Silver Loan Rotated: The early market yuan cent price was 6 qian, 8 fen, 8 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, half, which was slightly smaller than the early market of the previous day. At the noon market, the sharp drop of 7 hao, half was 6 qian, 8 fen, 7 li, 6 hao, 2 hu, half. The result was one cent smaller. Silver Loan was one qian, six fen in the early market, which was also one cent more than the previous day. The afternoon market fell back six cents, only one cent, which is a phenomenon that should be rotated. The bank's listed price was six cents, and the drawing fee ranged from three to four cents to a white fee.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Yuan Price Increase and Copper Coin Contraction: The Jiang'an small Yuan increased by more than three li in the early market, which was 6 qian 04 li 2 hao half. In the noon market, it was good by seven hao, half, which was 6 qian 05 li. Between the two markets, the increase was as high as four li two hao half. The transaction was 6,000 yuan in the early market and 4,500 yuan in the noon market. The Guangdong small Yuan was 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, 2 hao, half, which was one li higher than the previous day. The noon market still fell back to the original market, which was 5 qian, 8 fen, 4 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, half. The transactions made were 144,000 Yuan in the early market and 45,000 yuan in the noon market. Copper coins were contracted by 1,000 yuan, which was 429,000 yuan, and the transaction was 43,700 yuan.</p>
<p>The Receipt and Dispatch of Silver Deposits Was Unusually Complicated: The Silver Deposits were extremely busy because the bank opened and closed, and the receipts and dispatches were combined for three days. Chinese businessmen received and dispatched 3.7 million to 8 million yuan, foreign businessmen received and dispatched more than 4 million yuan, special receipts and dispatches were more than 1.5 million yuan, and there were especially many settlements, including more than 3.5 million yuan for foreign businessmen and 2.4 to 5 million yuan for Chinese businessmen. The collateral trading totaled 1.7 to 8 million yuan, telegraphic transfer was 900,000 yuan, and various goods, remittances, taxes, and other receipts and dispatches were 4.9 million yuan for foreign businessmen and 7.12 million yuan for Chinese businessmen. 1.5 million yuan was withdrawn from the warehouse. The receipt and dispatch of money houses and silver public orders was 34 million yuan. The receipt and dispatch of the drawing fee was 5.6 million yuan. The remittances from various routes were more than 900,000 yuan, and the receipts were more than 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Silver Transactions Are Still Limited: Yesterday, the amount of remittances was very small. It was 640,000 in the early market and only 305,000 in the noon market. The banknotes were 35,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the noon market. The off-market banknotes were 120,000 in the early market and 90,000 in the noon market. The bank cheques were 58,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the noon market. The bank trading was 600,000 in the early market and only 300,000 in the noon market. The receipt and dispatch of foreign accounts between banks was 2.5 million yuan, and the banknotes collected and issued were 2.67 million yuan. The receipt and dispatch of foreign public orders in the money houses was 8.45 million yuan, the foreign drawing fee was 3.2 million yuan, and the foreign currency loans were 2.22 million yuan. About 1 million yuan was collected in this street, which was due at the end of the month, and the small money house traded 8 to 900,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Trend of Securities and Bond Market Is Rotational <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Although there were increases and decreases compared to the previous exchanges, the market situation was still calm. Yesterday (the 2nd), the Huashang Securities Exchange had various bond market conditions, but although there were several kinds of spot goods, only 20,000 yuan was accounted for by the unified tax, and the others were only several thousand yuan each, totaling 29,000 yuan. The futures market was still calm, and only the August futures transaction was not lonely, and the 20-volume transaction in September accounted for 50,000 yuan, and the rest were still without a market. According to statistics, a total of 2.81 million was issued between the two markets, and the Chinese salt tax accounted for 530,000, and the others were mostly around 300,000, while the tariff 96 Zheng 6 accounted for only tens of thousands of yuan each. As for the changes in the price of each bond, the general trend was to rise first and then fall, and the trend was quite inconsistent. At the beginning of the morning opening, the market situation seemed good, with scattered receipts from all parties, which was more prosperous than the sale, and the price was mostly higher than the previous day, ranging from six to seven cents to more than one yuan. However, the buying momentum gradually weakened, so the price returned to rotational and lowered, and the result was mutual increases and decreases compared to the previous day, about half a yuan. The bond market situation was quite chaotic.</p>

<p>Business Restarts in Both Markets Today</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is weakening, with a softer trend. This is due to recent sluggish demand from various merchants and heightened military tensions in Jehol, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty. Small investors are inclined to sell, further weakening the market. However, Rongxing and Changfeng, with their bullish stance, remain calm and unwilling to sell, providing some stability to the market. Nevertheless, rumors in the market suggest that Tianjin Hua Yarn may still be subject to forced delivery, leading outside investors to sell short, further weakening the market. However, the inventory levels of various factories are lower than before.</p>
<p>Near-month futures have fallen by half, while far-month futures have risen. In the pre-market trading of Human Brand yarn, the market atmosphere was unfavorable and buyers were scarce, causing the near-month futures to fall by 5.6 qian. The far-month futures then rose by 3 qian. In the second and third rounds of trading, prices fell again due to the declining price of raw cotton, which further depressed the yarn market. As a result, the prices for all months fell by 1.1 to 1.4 qian. The total trading volume was 24,200 bales. Sales included 1,350 bales from Dafu, 1,250 bales from Hengyi, 550 bales from Gengfeng, 1,050 bales from Changji, 600 bales from Changfeng, and 400 bales from Tonghe. Purchases included 1,650 bales from Yichang, 600 bales from Dachang, 750 bales from Shenchang, and 400 bales from Taixing Shen. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Impact of US Cotton Inventory Announcement</p>
<p>The cotton market plummeted, with the downward trend intensifying. This was triggered by the announcement of US cotton inventories, which amounted to 13,449,000 bales, an increase of over 4 million bales compared to last year. This news greatly shocked the local market, leading to expectations of a price decline in US cotton. Speculators rushed to sell short, causing panic in the market. However, the price of US cotton remained stable, and some major players aggressively bought long positions. However, the majority of market participants believed that US cotton inventories were too high, limiting the potential for price increases, and therefore leaned towards expecting a decline. The future direction of the market will continue to depend on the movements of US cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Brand Falls by 7 Qian: In the pre-market trading of Zheng Brand cotton, the market atmosphere was good due to stable US cotton prices. However, in the second and third rounds of trading, the news of US cotton inventories arrived, causing widespread panic and a sharp decline in the market. As a result, the prices for all months fell by 5.5 to 7 qian. The total trading volume was 58,300 dan. Sales included 1,000 dan from Dafeng, 1,900 dan from Changji, 1,700 dan from Yuanda, 1,400 dan from Renfeng, 1,600 dan from Yiyu, 1,000 dan from Xincheng, and 2,400 dan from Yuchang. Purchases included 4,500 dan from Yuanda, 1,100 dan from Daji, 2,400 dan from Rongxing, 1,800 dan from Shenchang, 1,100 dan from Tongxing, and 1,100 dan from Ruiyuan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Brand Closing Price (Increase/Decrease) Inventory December 5100 (Down 6.5) 281,900 August 3150 (Down 7.0) 102,700</p>

<p>November 3095 (Down 7.0) 286,600</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Mills Completely Close Purchases: Consumption of spot cotton is slow, and the yarn market is weakening again. The sudden sharp decline in cotton futures has further discouraged mills from purchasing. It is estimated that 300 bales of Yao cotton were sourced.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm due to strong activity on Wall Street, a favorable cloth market, and a lack of sellers. Futures prices rose by 1 to 2 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. The English and Indian cotton markets were closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (Dated the 1st):</p>

<p>Cotton Fields Reduced by Approximately 20-30% Compared to Last Year According to a report released by a Japanese trading company, there was excessive rainfall and low temperatures in various cotton-producing areas during the planting season in mid-May. Frequent rain followed planting. Recently, the climate has recovered, raising hopes for a normal crop. Cotton fields have been reduced by 20-30% compared to last year due to the poor cotton harvests of the past three years, the decline in foreign cotton prices, and the widespread banditry, which hinders farming. The situation in various regions is as follows: Han River Basin: Reduced by 30% compared to last year. Hometown: Reduced by 20%. Zaoyang Suizhou: No change. Pinghan Railway Line: Reduced by 20%. Shashi: No significant difference. Yangtze River Basin: Reduced by 40%.</p>
<p>The harvest volumes for the past ten years are as follows:</p>

<p>Rice Market Shows Sluggish Activity</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, only three boats arrived from various merchants due to strong winds. Furthermore, the stocks at the docks are also low, making city and rural shops feel increasingly active. The price of thick japonica rice has rebounded, rising by nearly 10 cents. There are some accumulated stocks of thin early rice. Merchants from the interior are stagnant, and sales on this street are poor. The market price has increased by 15 cents. The sale of Yangdujian rice is slow, and the market is stable. The sale of black rice is slow, and the market is flat.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, 6 or 7 boats arrived on the west side of the market. Dock stocks are also low. Shops on this street report that business is poor due to unfavorable weather, and people expect prices to rise. The price of medium and secondary grades of northern japonica rice has increased by another 10 to 20 cents. Early and late rice are sold as soon as they arrive, with prices rising by nearly 10 cents. The sale of new japonica rice is stable, and the market situation is settled. The market situation for Yangdujian rice is stable because sales have been weak for several days.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Foreign Rice Rebounds by 4-5 Cents <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Merchants from the Interior Continue to Purchase Yesterday, the foreign rice market continued the price increases of the previous day, and market sentiment was very good. Furthermore, merchants from the interior became greedy and purchased over 3,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice in the general market. Shops on this street and small investors continued to participate, causing the market price to rise by 4-5 cents compared to the previous day. A total of over 4,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were offered, priced at $9.50 to $9.32. 1,000 bags of old Xiaojiao rice were offered, priced at $9.00. 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were offered, priced at $10.12. It is estimated that there are still slightly over 1 million bags of foreign rice on the market. However, recent arrivals have been weak, and shipments from distributors and firms are increasing daily, suggesting that the market can temporarily stabilize. Whether the market price will continue to rise in the future will depend on the strength of sales to customers.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Flour Market Retreats After Rising <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed an initial rise followed by a softening trend. In the first two rounds of trading, prices rose due to short covering and high wheat prices in the production areas. Demand from interior consumers was quite strong, causing prices to rise by approximately 2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The price for the current month reached a high of 1 tael and 9 qian and 7.5 fen, the price for September reached 1 tael and 9 qian and 9 fen and 2.5 li, and the price for October reached 2 taels and 7 li and 5 hao. The strength of the market at that time can be imagined. However, after the fourth round of trading, news emerged that factories were slightly liquidating positions, causing market sentiment to soften and prices to fall by over 1 fen from their highs. However, in reality, if there is no activity in foreign flour wheat, then these market values should be able to hold. As a result, the price for the current month was up 2.5 li compared to the previous day, the price for September was down 2.5 li, the price for October was up 7.5 li, and the prices for November and December were up 2.5 li. The price for January was up 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Recent Wheat Prices Soar <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed another soaring trend. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower, the majority of market participants were focused on near-term contracts because spot wheat prices in the production areas are rising steadily and are now close to exceeding the standard price. Although current demand is not particularly strong, it is difficult to gather a large quantity of spot wheat. This is a major reason why the bulls are unwilling to let go. The rise in far-term contracts was smaller due to the potential arrival of foreign wheat. As a result, the price for the current month was up 5 fen compared to the previous day, the price for September was up 7 fen, the price for October was up 6 fen, the price for November was up 3 fen, and the price for December was up 2 fen. The spot wheat market was lively due to weak arrivals and rising standard prices. Zhenjiang wheat was quoted at 3 taels and 3 qian, totaling 235 bags.</p>

<p>Raw Sugar Also Sees Higher Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the sugar market association's trading session, the Finance Department had not yet sent an official document to customs regarding the exemption of one-fourth of the tax payment for Swire Sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar for February and March orders. As a result, taxes could not be paid immediately, and shipments were tight. The transaction price remained at 14 taels and 6 qian, but there was a shortage of buyers, and the market trend was quite strong. The price for sugar that had not yet been taxed was 14 taels and 4 qian, and the trend was relatively flat. Raw sugar prices rose to 12 taels and 7 qian, but there were no buyers. Trading in Swire Sugar gradually became more active. B mark was at 16 taels and 4 qian, CW mark was at 15 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, HX mark was at 15 taels and 3 qian, HM mark was at 14 taels and 8 qian, and H mark was at 12 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen. Swire also sold several hundred bags at the same time. D mark was at 16 taels and 5 qian, CW mark was at 16 taels, DY mark was at 15 taels and 7 qian, HX mark was at 15 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen, and H mark was at 12 taels and 7 qian. Although these were scattered transactions, the market sentiment was quite firm.</p>

<p>Hainan Longan: It is now the season for new longan. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship arrived from Hong Kong with a batch of new goods, totaling only 21 pieces. Samples are expected to be available today. It is the first offering of new goods, and the quantity is small, so the price is likely to be high. However, it is said that this year's harvest is quite abundant, so the initial price should not be too high to avoid hindering future market prices.</p>

<p>The local foreign tea market is showing a strong interest in Zhenmei green tea from Wudong, Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian, with British firms such as Hsieh Ho and Jardine showing a strong interest. Trading throughout the city is unusually active, with a total of over 5,200 boxes changing hands. The activity in the market is unprecedented in recent times. As a result, Chinese tea merchants are taking a firm stance, and prices have soared by 7-8 taels. The current inventory of Zhenmei tea on the market has already been sold by two-thirds. Supplies from the interior are becoming depleted, and the market is likely to continue to rise.</p>

<p>European and American markets: Japanese silk merchants are catering to the price pressures of silk thread merchants and are relentlessly promoting sales by lowering prices. Orders for white filature are being rejected because prices are considered too high, and a turnaround in silk sales is unlikely. Yesterday, Dachan and other firms imported 40 bales of upper-middle grade B white filature, with Jinshuang and Yuetu brands offering 13-15 strand filaments at 580 taels. Longjinma and other brands offered 13-20 strand filaments at 485 taels. Suzhou Silk Factory imported 5 bales of Fengque brand 13-22 strand filaments at 500 taels.</p>

<p>New Envoy to Present Credentials Date Yet to Be Determined</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the financial situation of the National Government has been strained. Customs revenues from the three northeastern provinces have been successively seized, further depleting the national treasury. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacted the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy to request a one-year deferral of the Boxer Indemnity payments from March of this year to February of next year. All three countries have agreed. A Central News Agency reporter met with personnel from the Italian Embassy's Shanghai office yesterday. According to them, Sino-Italian relations have always been harmonious. Regarding the Boxer Indemnity issue, when Shen Ruilin was the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, both parties had a return agreement. The agreement at the time stipulated that the returned Italian Boxer Indemnity would be used to manage educational and charitable causes between China and Italy, and designated that a certain amount of the funds be used to open the port of Haizhou, dredge the Huai River, and build the Cao'e River Bridge. Therefore, the issue of the Italian Boxer Indemnity not only being suspended for one year is not a problem, but the issue of continued returns can also be discussed. The date on which the new Italian envoy, Ciano, will present his credentials in Beijing cannot be determined at this time because the credentials have not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful Demands The telegraph workers at the Lao Bei Men Radio Telegraph General Bureau, the Sima Road China Telegraph Bureau, and the Renji Road Sassoon Building International Telegraph Company, demanded improved treatment and a universal increase in wages of three yuan per month. This was approved by the Ministry of Communications, divided into four grades of increase: (A) an increase of 5 jiao, (B) an increase of 1 yuan, (C) an increase of 1.5 yuan, and (D) an increase of 2 yuan, with increases determined by work performance. All workers expressed dissatisfaction and insisted on a minimum universal wage increase of two yuan per month.</p>
<p>Staged a Strike The China Telegraph Bureau on Sima Road, which sends and receives domestic and international wired telegraphs, employs a total of 65 telegraph delivery workers. Due to repeated requests to improve treatment, which had not been granted, they collectively staged a strike on the morning of the previous day at 11:00 AM to awaken the authorities. As a result, telegrams arriving at the station lacked delivery personnel and had to be temporarily suspended. Afterwards, Bureau Chief Rong Baofeng invited worker representatives and persuaded the workers to resume work first, stating that he fully accepted the workers' request to increase wages by two yuan and would immediately report it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Consequently, all workers resumed work at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Sending Telegrams as Usual The Lao Bei Men Radio Telegraph General Bureau, which specializes in sending and receiving domestic wireless telegrams, employs 48 workers. The International Telegraph Company on Renji Road, which specializes in sending and receiving foreign wireless telegrams, employs 32 workers. All workers, because the authorities still had not agreed to the wage increase and the wages they received were insufficient to live on, had no choice but to jointly stage a strike at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. As a result, telegrams arriving in Shanghai at these two telegraph companies lacked delivery personnel and were temporarily suspended. However, sending telegrams continued as usual, and by 6:00 PM, there were over 300 items piled up.</p>
<p>Workers Petition The International Telegraph Company workers sent representatives Yang Ziqing and Qian Haiping. The Radio Telegraph Company workers sent representatives Liu Youliang, Gu Yuesheng, and Zhu Xunlin. They all went to the International Telegraph Bureau on Jing'an Temple Road and Mu'er Ming Road to petition, and the Telegraph Bureau workers also sent Ding Wenhe, Yang Zhicheng, and Jiang Hongdu to show their support. As for the striking workers, they all followed the petitioning representatives and gathered in the garden of the International Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<p>Workers' Statement Yesterday, a worker representative gave a statement to the New Voice News Agency, saying, "When the Radio Telegraph Company was under the management of the Construction Committee, wages were increased twice a year, in January and June, by two yuan each time. Since the Ministry of Communications took over, wages have been increased only once a year. The usual minimum wage is 15 yuan, and the maximum is 25 yuan, with food and lodging provided by the workers themselves. There was no increase last year, and as of July 1st of this year, there was still no increase, so we contacted the Radio Telegraph Company workers to request an increase. This is really a matter of last resort, and we hope that all sectors will understand."</p>
<p>Persuaded to Return to Work The Director of the Telegraph Administration and Acting Director of the International Telegraph Bureau, Zhong E, ordered the worker representatives to explain to the workers that a strike by communications industry workers is of great importance to public security and persuaded them to resume work first. He fully accepted the request for a two-yuan wage increase. However, the Shanghai General Bureau would implement the increase starting in August of this year, and the International Telegraph Company would implement the increase starting in January of next year. The worker representatives then withdrew and reported the accepted persuasion to the workers, and at 7:00 PM they announced the resumption of work.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Northeast Postal Service Changes Blockade Measures <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>South Manchurian Railway Area Postal services to the Northeast will be delivered as usual from yesterday. After the Ministry of Communications ordered the Postal Administration to implement a blockade, the South Manchurian Railway area was also included in the blockade. Later, after the Postal Director Lin Shi arrived in Shanghai and consulted with Postal Director-General Huang Naishu several times, they slightly changed the previously determined blockade measures and decided to open postal services to the South Manchurian Railway area and receive and send mail as usual. The delivery route was changed to delivery via Dalian. Yesterday morning (the 2nd), Postal Director-General Huang Naishu issued a special order to the Shanghai Administration to comply with the regulations. The Administration Director Zha Peilin immediately informed the staff, so that all would be aware. Therefore, starting yesterday afternoon, the bureau has accepted and sent mail to the South Manchurian Railway area, but the blockade will remain in effect outside the railway area. Furthermore, the Shanghai Postal Administration also issued order No. 1607, informing postal staff to accept airmail lightweight mail to Europe. The original order stated, "In order to inform you, all bureaus may accept mail from Saigon to Marseilles. They should all handle it in accordance with the provisions opened in [Postal Bureau No. 776]."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Siberian Mail Arrived Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Approximately Sent Before Mid-Last Month</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, Siberian mail, totaling 160 bags, was transferred by train to Shanghai yesterday. These included mail from London on July 15th, Paris on July 15th and 16th, and Berlin on July 16th and 17th. However, mail from London and Paris on July 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, and mail from Berlin on July 13th, 14th, and 15th have not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Northeast Postal Workers Arrive at Customs Successively to Report <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to Escape from Jilin-Heilongjiang Region Due to Surveillance Negotiations with Barlidi Have Not Yet Yielded Results</p>
<p>Postal Director Lin Shi had not yet returned to Beijing yesterday. In the morning, he went to the Postal Administration to discuss official business with Huang Naishu. The official report regarding the investigation of the establishment of post offices by the Japanese had not yet arrived at the bureau. However, the postal staff of the three northeastern provinces are now a key issue following the blockade of the Northeast postal service. According to reports received by the Postal Administration, as of yesterday, a total of nine people had returned from outside the customs area and reported to Shanghai: four people served in the Jilin-Heilongjiang region, and five people served in the Shenyang region. A total of 98 people reported to Tianjin: 27 postal officers, 15 postal assistants, and 56 messengers and workers. Many people have also successively reported to Shandong Province, but the exact number is unknown. As for the postal staff currently in the three regions of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Shenyang, the total number is over 2,000. The situation now is that the issue of the staff in the Shenyang region returning is easier than in the Jilin-Heilongjiang region. This is because the Shenyang region was prepared when the puppet state took over, so there was no shortage of people working. However, in the Jilin-Heilongjiang region, the postal workers were instigated by the puppet state's postal director, and the puppet government issued an order to all landlords stating that if postal personnel lived in their homes and were allowed to escape, only the landlords would be questioned. Therefore, the issue of returning has become more difficult. Northeast Postal Director Barlidi has been strongly negotiating with the puppet state, but it is unknown when there will be results.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Interview with Postal Workers from the Jilin-Heilongjiang Region Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Jilin City Post Office Losses Exceed 130,000 Yuan, Emuyang Postmaster Killed by Japanese Troops, Anti-Japanese Volunteers Appear Everywhere, Japanese Feeling Helpless, According to Guo Wen Agency: Yesterday, the reporter met with two postal workers, Zhu and Chen (names requested not to be published), from the Jilin-Heilongjiang region who had arrived in Shanghai at their residence. They were asked about the postal service and political situation in the Northeast. Their accounts were filled with immeasurable sorrow and indignation. We, the people living peacefully within the Great Wall, living like swallows in a safe nest or fish in a pot, seemingly unaware that the map of the Northeast has changed color, should sigh with regret. The following is a record of their accounts, which can be summarized as follows: The two of us worked at the Jilin City Post Office. The postal districts of the three northeastern provinces are divided into two regions: Liaoning and Jilin-Heilongjiang. The Liaoning region's general office is in Shenyang, and the postal director is Barritt. The Jilin-Heilongjiang region is formed by the merger of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and the general office is located in Harbin, with Smith as the postal director. The total number of personnel in both regions, including postal workers and laborers, is between 2,800 and 2,900, with the Jilin-Heilongjiang region accounting for 1,500 to 1,600. We received orders on the 25th of last month and took a train to Dalian the next day. Because our ancestral homes are in Zhejiang and Guangdong, we came directly from Dalian to Shanghai and arrived at the port on the 31st. The postal and local political situation in the Jilin-Heilongjiang region is extremely chaotic. Initially, the puppet state's postal director, the Japanese Fujiwara, publicly stated that the postal service of the three provinces would be taken over on August 1st. In reality, this was a strategy to appease the postal workers. Suddenly, on the 24th and 25th, they forcibly seized control. Therefore, we learned of the news on the 25th and also received the official order to enter the customs, so we stopped going to the office. If we had gone, we would have been detained or placed under surveillance. The various coercive and oppressive measures were worse than those in a colony. Currently, the Jilin first-class postmaster, Chen Weiping, and the Changchun postmaster, Li Kede, are both under Japanese surveillance. Among the twelve people wanted by the puppet state, seven or eight have been arrested. Li Rulin, the former director of the parcel tax office, has been temporarily appointed by the puppet state as the Jilin postmaster, and Jin Zhenmin, the son-in-law of the puppet state's Minister of Communications, has been appointed as the Changchun postmaster. All postal affairs of the puppet state are handled under the direction of the Japanese Fujiwara. The losses, in terms of real estate alone, for the Jilin Province Post Office exceed 130,000 yuan, not including other losses such as remittances, stamps, and a small number of cash remittances. When we departed from Jilin, the administration of the three provinces could be said to have been almost completely destroyed. Recently, the postal service was managed to a conclusion by the two postal directors, Barritt and Smith. The puppet state, recognizing the lack of specialized personnel, is willing to use a large amount of money to bribe lower-level postal workers to stay. In some places, because everyone has fled, it is impossible to deliver mail. Therefore, they have no choice but to use postal workers who are more familiar with the area. Thus, there are even cases where postal workers have become postmasters in several post offices. The extremity of their predicament can be imagined. Local resistance to the Japanese is becoming increasingly enthusiastic. Anti-Japanese volunteers in groups of fifty or one hundred appear everywhere. When they encounter a small number of enemies, they surround and annihilate them. When a large force comes to reinforce them, they retreat. As a result, they are constantly on the move. The anti-Japanese volunteers are not only familiar with the terrain but also have complete weapons. Therefore, the Japanese also feel helpless in the face of this. The most powerful anti-Japanese volunteer force in Jilin Province is Wang Delin's, which has been joined by patriotic individuals one after another and now exceeds 300,000. It must be said that it is a powerful force. The Japanese are brutal beyond human comprehension. They use all kinds of methods of killing, including beheading and dismemberment. For example, a resident of Liaoning Province sent a letter from Nanjing, and if the words contained any dissatisfaction with the puppet state, he would be arrested by the Japanese army and is still in prison to this day. Even within the postal service in Jilin Province, there was a postmaster named Yang (his given name is unknown) at the Emuyang Post Office. When the Japanese army sent a team to forcibly take over the office, Yang was drafting a telegram to report the puppet state's forced seizure of the postal service in the Northeast. The Japanese obtained a copy of the telegram and immediately took him away. His fate is unknown to this day. According to rumors, Yang is no longer alive and was shot by the Japanese army. Furthermore, if passersby discuss politics and are interrogated by Japanese agents, they are forcibly identified as anti-Japanese volunteers and subjected to whipping and other tortures without end. Speaking of this causes deep pain. We are very fortunate to have escaped the tiger's den. He went on to say that he had already reported to the general office and was currently preparing a report. The general office had agreed to find a way to arrange their lives, but the specific location had not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Various Industries Continue to Resist Foreign Goods <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the appearance of the Blood Soul Assassination Squad, the sale of inferior goods has stopped immediately, proving to be very effective. All industries have also reorganized their inspection efforts. The following is a record of the news obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Statement from the Nanjing Road Business Association: This port received a letter yesterday from the Nanjing Road Business Association stating, "We, the members of this association, have always been at the forefront of patriotic advocacy and practical action to save the country. Our actions are clear and have long been recognized by society. Furthermore, we are honored to be the most prosperous business group on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Knowing that the actions of our members will be closely watched by all sectors at home and abroad, we are making every effort to promote domestic products and resist foreign goods, striving to set an example. Since the September 18th Incident, at the request of a majority of our members, we have strictly sealed off foreign goods and repeatedly sent inspectors to ensure that all stores have cleared and stopped selling them. After the end of the Shanghai War, a small number of stores, constrained by economic stagnation, cleaned up and sold off their old inventory, or have already sold their businesses and mixed in foreign goods. Our association is deeply concerned that a small number of unscrupulous elements, beyond the reach of our authority and unable to be controlled, will damage the reputation of all stores on the road and arouse criticism from all sectors in Shanghai. Therefore, on the one hand, we are advising all members and non-member stores to correct their behavior if they have done wrong and to make greater efforts if they have not. On the other hand, we are repeatedly convening meetings to discuss appropriate measures to ensure that all stores on this road can act in good conscience, voluntarily commit to never buying or selling foreign goods. Unexpectedly, a group called the Blood Soul Assassination Squad has recently used extraordinary means to stop unscrupulous merchants. Yesterday, they sent a letter to our association, ordering us to advise our members to clear out foreign goods within a time limit. Their righteousness and fervor are evident on paper and are understood by society. It is our association's duty to work harder. However, the actions of this group are prone to legal pitfalls, which may please our enemies or even cause unexpected disturbances. It seems that they should be cautious in their actions. Since the letter has no address, our association cannot answer in detail. We respectfully use the newspapers to express our sincere advice and solemnly declare to our patriotic compatriots, hoping that they will observe carefully. Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Association."</p>
<p>Letter from the Match Industry Association: The All-China Match Industry Association, fearing that its member factories would become lax in resisting Japanese goods over time, sent a special letter to its member factories yesterday stating, "Dear Sirs, Since the Wanxian Incident and the September 18th Incident last year, the Chinese people have been indignant at the barbarity of Japanese imperialism and have continued to resist foreign goods. For a time, Japanese goods disappeared from the market. However, after the signing of the Shanghai War Armistice Agreement, Japanese goods reappeared and have recently regained their position as the number one imported goods. In this situation, not only has the goal of resisting foreign goods not been achieved, but also all previous efforts have been wasted. We are deeply saddened by this. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to advise all our members to adhere to their original intentions, persevere to the end, reject all Japanese materials, and never willingly join the ranks of unscrupulous merchants. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Yongan Foreign Goods Still Sealed: The Yongan Company on Nanjing Road also received a warning from the Blood Soul Squad. A reporter from the New Voice Society visited Mr. Guo, the general manager of the company, yesterday to inquire about the company's response to the Assassination Squad's warning. Mr. Guo replied, "Since the Northeast Incident, all foreign goods have been sealed and sales have been stopped. At that time, the Anti-Japanese Association clearly identified the number of items, separately recorded them, and sealed them. They remain sealed and can be inspected at any time." The reporter then asked, "Since your company's old foreign goods have been sealed, are you now indirectly importing foreign goods privately?" Mr. Guo said, "This is even more unreasonable. The old foreign goods are still sealed. Why would we spend more money to buy new ones? Even the most foolish person would not do this. Furthermore, one hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of the world. All sectors can conduct close inspections at any time, and the truth will be revealed."</p>
<p>Clothing Industry Association Implements Inspections: Since the September 18th Incident, the Clothing Industry Association immediately established an inspection team to conduct mutual inspections on the transportation of clothing packages, with excellent results. Later, the Anti-Japanese Association was ordered to stop, and the association's inspection team also stopped at the same time. Yesterday's newspaper reported that several transport companies were found to be mixing and smuggling inferior goods in clothing packages, which caused great indignation. Therefore, they have reorganized the inspection team and will immediately supervise each other and implement inspections.</p>
<p>Silk and Cotton Weaving Industry Held a General Meeting Yesterday: The silk and cotton weaving industry held a temporary membership meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss thorough measures. More than 70 people attended, including Zhu Wenqi, Pan Xusheng, Qian Chenrong, Zhu Zhenhan, Guan Pingqin, Cui Fuzhuang, and Cao Youguang. First, Chairman Zhu Wenqi reported on the urgency of the national crisis and the measures for merchants to save themselves. Then, the discussion began. Under the enthusiastic atmosphere of the members, they unanimously voted to actively use domestic goods and thoroughly eliminate inferior goods. The measures were divided into (A) notifying all members to actively report, (B) contacting relevant industries to conduct a unified investigation, etc. Pan Xusheng was appointed to contact the Cotton Cloth Industry Association first. (C) Dyeing factories, cloth factories, and cloth shops were divided into groups to study and discuss detailed plans and submit them to the Executive Committee for handling. Guan Pingqin, Yin Shuqiao, Gu Yongquan, Zhang Minglun, Zhu Gengtao, Zhu Maoting, and Zheng Jirong were appointed as members of the Dyeing Factory Group, with Guan Pingqin as the convener. Zhu Zhenhan, Xu Yangnan, Guan Bingqing, Qian Chenrong, He Dehuai, Cao Youguang, and Yan Guangdi were appointed as members of the Cloth Factory Group, with Qian Chenrong as the convener. The Cloth Shop Group was to appoint its own members and report to the association. All groups were required to convene meetings within one week. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Grain Association Investigates Japanese Rice: Ten companies, including Zaliang Youbing Tongye Nanshi Zhabei Dingfeng Hengxing and Heji, purchased a large quantity of Japanese rice. After the industry association reported this to the Grain Association, the association held a special meeting on the 27th of last month and summoned the companies to the meeting to question them. They all said that the foreign rice they purchased was purchased from Tongxingtai and was brokered by brokers. They did not order it from Japanese foreign firms. If they did not believe it, they could check the accounts. The association sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and sent a letter to Tongxingtai asking when the rice was shipped, on what ship it was transported, how much there was, and whether it was registered, requesting a prompt reply. The association received a reply yesterday and immediately convened a meeting of the industry association in the afternoon, chaired by Cai Yukun, to report on the progress of the situation and read the letter from Tongxingtai to the association. They asked the industry association to discuss the measures. After discussion, the industry association believed that Tongxingtai was entrusted by a certain Japanese foreign firm to sell the rice and that the industry association was unaware of this and was deceived into purchasing it. Now that the companies reported that they purchased it from Tongxingtai, and Tongxingtai's reply was slightly inconsistent, the matter should be investigated. After deliberation, the association instructed Tongxingtai to store the arrived goods in which warehouse and send a sample sheet to the association. After arriving at the warehouse, samples of the rice would be taken and another meeting would be held for public inspection to discuss the measures.</p>

<p>Will Not Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Zi Lin newspaper reports that the hurricane was heading north from near Taiwan, and for a time, it seemed likely to head straight for Shanghai. However, yesterday (the 1st), the Xujiahui Observatory received a report that it had changed direction to the northeast and was blowing towards the Yellow Sea, causing a strong easterly wind in the Yangtze River basin. It is said that the hurricane was no more than 60 miles from Shanghai at its closest point.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Incense Industry Workers' Union Decides to Resume Work Today <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Labor-Management Conditions Awaiting Mediation</p>
<p>After the incense industry workers went on strike to demand improved treatment, the Party and government authorities advised them to resume work first. Yesterday, the Workers' Union decided to fully resume work starting today, and labor-management conditions will be mediated according to the law. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Union Meeting: The Incense Industry Occupational Union went to the Party and government authorities the day before yesterday to request mediation. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau advised them to resume work first. Therefore, a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the union's office at No. 91 Dajili. Li Weixiong from the Municipal Party Committee and Zhu Sen from the Social Affairs Bureau attended to advise them. All members were present, and the meeting was chaired by Yang Pansheng and recorded by Zhou Weixin. First, the chairman reported on the strike. Then, representatives from the Party and government authorities gave advice. It was decided on the spot that (1) in order to respect the advice of the Party and government authorities, all workers would resume work starting tomorrow (the 3rd). (2) The Party and government authorities were requested to convene a mediation between the two parties within three days. (3) The wage increase of 40% was still requested. (4) Diao Jinlin and Zhu Liansheng, were condemned as capitalists' lackeys who colluded with hooligans to force workers in Pudong to resume work. In addition to being expelled from the union, the Party and government authorities were requested to severely punish them.</p>
<p>Notice of Resumption of Work: The Incense Industry Occupational Union issued a notice to all workers last night stating, "Notice: After investigating, all workers in this industry were unable to withstand the oppression of the capitalists and were forced to go on strike automatically on the afternoon of July 28th. However, they were able to maintain order, which is commendable. Now, in accordance with the advice of the Party and government authorities, it is proposed to resume work on the 3rd. However, because our group is far away and transportation is inconvenient, work will be delayed until the 4th. Representatives of the Party and government authorities have verbally promised to convene a mediation within three days. If the capitalists continue to be cunning, we will submit a request to the higher authorities for review. Please be informed. This is to notify you."</p>
<p>Mediation to be Held Soon: Starting at 7:00 PM yesterday, incense workers in the Hakka group began preparing incense materials in the workshops in accordance with the union's orders and were scheduled to officially resume work today. However, most of the workers in this group are in Gaoqiao and other places. Due to the limited time, they will need to enter the workshops this afternoon to prepare incense materials and officially resume work tomorrow morning. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau, because the workers accepted the advice of the Party and government authorities, decided to formally convene a labor-management mediation within the next few days.</p>

<p>The Songhu Road Returned to Municipal Management – A Satisfactory Result</p>
<p>Previously, for the sake of developing the downtown area, the Shanghai Municipal Government consulted with the Ministry of Railways to transfer the management rights of the Songhu Road to the Municipal Government for handling. The Ministry of Railways convened a meeting in Nanjing on July 30th to discuss this. The Municipal Government also sent Public Utilities Bureau Director Huang Boqiao and Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi to Beijing to participate. Both Shen and Huang have already returned to Shanghai and reported the details of their trip to Beijing to Mayor Wu. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Public Works Bureau yesterday to interview Director Shen, who stated that he (Shen) and Director Huang were ordered to go to Beijing to participate in the Ministry of Railways meeting. Attendees included the two representatives from the Municipal Government, Minister Gu, Vice Minister Zeng, and various department and section chiefs from the Ministry of Railways. The mission of the Municipal Government representatives was to report the actual situation in Shanghai and explain to the Ministry of Railways the reasons for requesting the transfer of management of the Songhu Road. This was because the Songhu Road is actually one of the most important tasks for the future development of the downtown area. Considering the Songhu Road as it is today, it not only fails to aid the development of the downtown area but also presents various obstacles to development. Therefore, the Municipal Government intends to request the transfer of management rights in order to renovate and reorganize the Songhu Road. Currently, the Ministry of Railways is quite considerate of the issue of municipal development in Shanghai. Therefore, the Ministry has indicated that it will consider the various points reported by the Municipal Government representatives. For example, regarding the North Station relocation issue, the Ministry of Railways has notified the Municipal Government that the area south of Shida Road will be used as the main passenger station, and the area west of Zhenbei Road will be the site for the joint operation station of the Jinghu and Huhang railways. This decision does not entail any benefit for the Ministry of Railways but has a significant impact on the municipal development of Shanghai. Therefore, the results of this trip to Beijing are considered satisfactory.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry Ordered National Federation of Commerce to Notify</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received an instruction yesterday from the Ministry of Industry stating that the deadline for amending company charters has expired again. Starting from July 1st of this year, the deadline is extended for another six months. The original order stated: "Regarding compliance matters, it has been found that some provisions of the company charters conflict with the Company Law. According to the law, these provisions should be amended and submitted for approval within six months after the implementation of the Company Law. By the end of December of the twentieth year, when the deadline expired, reasons for extending the deadline were duly prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which approved an extension of six months. The ministry has notified all provincial and municipal governments to comply accordingly. Now, this deadline has expired again on June 30th of this year. Many companies in various locations have made amendments in accordance with the law, but many others have been unable to make amendments on time due to various difficulties. Moreover, the charters of these companies were originally approved as valid documents, and there was no legal deadline for amendment under the old law. It is only because the new law has been implemented that conflicts cannot be allowed to persist indefinitely. The short deadline was intended to ensure that everyone complies with the new law as soon as possible. Now that amendments cannot be completed within the deadline, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and ensure that the charters of all companies comply, the Executive Yuan has issued Instruction No. 1838, approving an extension of another six months starting from July 1st of this year." In addition to separate notifications, this order is hereby issued for notification and compliance. All companies that have not yet amended their charters in accordance with the law must comply, make amendments, and report them promptly without further delay. This order.</p>

<p>Representative Conference to Be Convened with Public Organizations</p>
<p>During the board meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council last week, the Secretary-General presented a report stating that according to the National Government's Amnesty Law and its implementation regulations, a number of criminals should be released in succession. In addition to requesting the assistance of the Released Prisoners Relief Association, it may also be possible to ask various clan associations and charitable organizations to provide assistance to the released prisoners based on their place of origin. At the same time, the Chairman reported that Major Darby of the Salvation Army has been very concerned about the criminals released from Ward Road Jail and has provided train tickets and boat tickets for those who have homes to return to, sending them back to their hometowns. Now that a large number of criminals are about to be released under the Amnesty Law, it seems appropriate to ask various public organizations to do the same. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Council will find a way to invite various charitable public organizations to hold a representative conference in order to send the released criminals back to their hometowns as much as possible.</p>

<p>The United States will hold a Centennial Progress Exposition in Chicago on June 1st next year. Our country has decided to participate and established a preparatory committee on June 15th. The committee has leased a site at the Chicago venue, totaling one acre, or 43,560 square feet. It is now actively preparing to build the Chinese Pavilion, with two-fifths of the area dedicated to the pavilion. The architectural style has been set as purely Chinese to represent Chinese culture and art. The construction cost is limited to US$30,000. The remaining two-fifths of the land will be used to arrange surrounding scenery and attach several outbuildings, with a cost not exceeding US$10,000. The exposition will only last for 150 days, so the construction only needs to take six months. The materials used do not need to be overly sturdy or expensive. Furthermore, the committee is widely soliciting designs in order to obtain the best design. All architects registered with the Ministry of Industry can apply. The deadline is August 20th for this city and August 30th for other cities. The selected designs will be awarded certificates by the Ministry of Industry and a reward of 500 national currency.

<h3 id="e150">Indian Police Prevent Moving, Actually Stabbing Tenant to Death <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Four Others Stabbing Wounded at the Same Time – Great Disturbance in Lizhong Lane – All Five Murderers Are Indians – Extrajudicial Murder Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The Lizhong Lane at the end of Yuezhou Road experienced a case of Indian police stabbing a Chinese person to death yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The detailed circumstances are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Topography of Lizhong Lane Lizhong Lane is located at the intersection of the Chinese concession of Yuezhou Road and Linping Road. There are more than one hundred houses in it. The area near Yuezhou Road is governed by the Huishan Police, accounting for about one-third of the total. The remaining two-thirds are managed by the Third Sub-bureau of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Usually, Chinese and concession police are dispatched to patrol from time to time. The big landlord is Chen Changkun, who works as a carpenter. He runs the Chen Wanxing Wood Shop at the intersection of Hailer Road and Oujia Road in this city. Last autumn, the landlord and tenants once litigated over the issue of rent increases. Chen lost the case, so he entrusted the entire management of the lane to the China Business Company at 70 Sichuan Road for management.</p>
<p>The Tyranny of the Four Indian Police After being authorized, the China Business Company hired four Indian police to take turns guarding the houses in the lane. The hired Indian police were named Yousha, Shamingen, Aili Haitai, and Manhuasigen. However, these four Indian police often threatened the residents in the lane, or even used torture. By the spring of this year, when the January 28th Incident occurred, the residents in the lane all fled with their families. The four Indian police took the opportunity to extort movers in every possible way. If they were not satisfied, they would wield knives. At that time, the tenant association of the lane reported to the Huishan Police Station, and the matter subsided slightly. In April, when the tenants gradually moved back, the Indian police relapsed. Therefore, conflicts arose. Afterwards, the Indian police stated that those who had moved in would never be allowed to move out again, but the tenants did not care.</p>
<p>Indian Police Forcibly Prevent Moving The rumors have been rampant in recent days, and the ignorant people have become panicked again. A tenant named Hong Kaifa, who is a carpenter, in Room 3, No. 28 of the lane, believed the rumors and invited his colleague Zhou Ayu to help him move yesterday (the 2nd) afternoon. Hong Kaifa was afraid that the Indian police would interfere, so he gave them one dollar in incense money in advance. Unexpectedly, the Indian police stated that it had to be four dollars, otherwise they would not let him go. Hong pleaded in every possible way, but to no avail. So Zhou Ayu suggested changing the route and going out of the lane through the Chinese boundary. While they were moving the furniture, an Indian police named Aladate, who was a gatekeeper in the Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company, had already tracked them down and came forward to stop them, and a dispute arose with Zhou and Hong. At the same time, the neighbors in the lane, seeing that the Indian police were unreasonable, all stood up for Zhou.</p>
<p>Zhou Ayu Stabbed to Death The Indian police were speechless and turned their anger into shame. Three of the Indian police pulled out sharp knives and stabbed at the crowd, and chased after Zhou Ayu. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zhou abandoned his belongings and ran wildly towards Linping Road. When he escaped to Renxin Lane, he was caught by the Indian police, who stabbed him in the left waist with a knife. Zhou fell to the ground and died. At this time, many residents were chasing after the Indian police. When Zhou was killed, the Indian police intended to turn back and escape into the concession. Seeing someone coming, they stabbed Yia San, Huang Ruifu, Cai Dianhua, and Xu Xiaocai, who were in front, with knives.</p>
<p>Five Murderers Arrested At that time, the Fifth District Third Sub-bureau had received a report from Dong Wu, the second landlord of Hong Kaifa. Patrol Officer Wang Yan led police chief Chen Yaxi and many police officers to the scene. Seeing that the matter involved a criminal case, they immediately arrested the murderers Yousha, Shamingen, and Aladate and detained them in the sub-bureau. Aili Haita and Manhuasigen intended to take the opportunity to escape. When they reached the entrance of Yuezhou Road, they were arrested by Huishan Police Nos. 2121 and 2010 and are now detained in the Huishan Police Station. The injured Yia San, Huang Ruifu, Cai Dianhua, and Xu Xiaocai were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by police cars. The murder weapon, three knives, are stored in the Fifth District Third Sub-bureau and the police station.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Tenants The injured Yia San is from Jiangbei, 28 years old, and is a carriage driver, injured in the head. Huang Ruifu is from Ningbo, 40 years old, injured in the forehead. Cai Dianhua is from Jiangbei, 22 years old, injured in the back, and is the owner of Bao Shunhua Meat Shop. Xu Xiaocai is from Haimen, 24 years old, injured in the chest, and is a cattle slaughterer. The deceased Zhou Ayu was 26 years old, from Shaoxing, and worked as a carpenter. The corpse and the furniture boxes and baskets moved out by Zhou are displayed in the lane. The local court will send someone to inspect them at 10:00 AM this morning. At the same time, the tenant association of the lane convened an emergency meeting last night to jointly decide on a method and separately submitted it to the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Lawyers Association, the Tenant General Association, the Six Townships Association, and the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association, requesting assistance.</p>

<p>The prosperous reopening of the Commercial Press's distribution office has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that in order to improve service efficiency, the office is having its staff provide sincere service and strive for promptness and thoroughness. It is also asking customers for supervision and guidance as a guideline for improvement. All employees wear numbered badges. A customer suggestion box has also been set up. Customers can express their suggestions in person to the director's office on the second floor or put them in the box in writing. In addition, a counter staff service competition method has been established. The office's publication counter, Western book counter, and stationery counter are each a battle position. Each counter is given 100 service points at the beginning of each month. If customers have any criticisms of the counter staff during the month, the evaluators will review and deduct points. At the end of the month, the counter with the fewest points deducted wins the service championship flag to encourage them. This spirit of service and competition method can truly bring customers and shop assistants closer together.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhilong, a local resident of the accounting office of the Continental Electric Light Company at 483 Foch Road, 30 years old, went to the branch at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road to check accounts last night at about 8:00 PM. While passing through the intersection of Sichuan Road and Doulean Road, he was suddenly struck by a motorcycle driven south to north by two Japanese naval soldiers, traveling at high speed. He was unable to avoid them in time, resulting in him being hit and falling to the ground, with his legs and head crushed, and his breath barely sustained. Seeing that they had caused an accident, the Japanese soldiers quickly helped the injured person into the car and drove to the nearby Japanese Fumin Hospital for treatment. When entering the hospital, they were seen by pedestrians, who called the police and reported it to the Dixiwei Road Police Station. The station ordered a western police officer to go to the hospital and transfer the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Zhou Zhilong's injuries are too severe, and his life is hopeless.</p>

<p>The Saltpeter-Sulfur Bureau of a certain organ of the National Government dispatched Yu Shunyuan to carry a list to the Yitaixing South Depot in Pudong at about 10:00 AM yesterday to pick up 50 barrels of saltpeter and sulfur. They ordered the pier boat of Song Longsheng to load them together, and hired the Xin Shunchang small wheel boat run by Sun Yusheng to tow the cargo ship to the Fair Road pier for unloading. Unexpectedly, when they arrived outside the Hongkou Port, the stern rudder of the cargo ship suddenly broke due to the impact of the tide, resulting in the loss of autonomy. It suddenly capsized, and the 50 barrels of saltpeter and sulfur it carried completely sank to the bottom of the river. Several boatmen also capsized under the boat. Fortunately, they were rescued from danger by the small wheel boat. Yu Shunyuan then took the old hands of both the small wheel boat and the cargo ship to the Customs Water Patrol Police Station to report the case and the reasons. The three parties returned to the Saltpeter-Sulfur Bureau to clarify which party should bear the responsibility for the losses incurred.</p>

<p>Letter Requesting Prohibition of Raising Prices of Domestic Goods The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent a letter yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Salvation Federation of various groups, stating that because the yarn industry took advantage of the boycott of Japanese goods to deliberately manipulate the market and raise the prices of domestic goods, it was obviously for other purposes and should be stopped by all means. Therefore, it was submitted to the Executive Committee of the Federation for detailed discussion. It was unanimously agreed that this kind of action not only contains speculative intentions and violates commercial credit, but also undermines the anti-Japanese movement and is tantamount to helping the enemy. It is feared that it is not only the yarn industry that is doing this, but other industries may also take similar actions. If strict measures are not taken to stop it, the harm will be endless. It was decided to send a letter to your federation, requesting you to find a way to warn them and urge them to realize their mistakes. If they persist in their evil ways, they should be given special sanctions to serve as a warning to others. Accordingly, the case is recorded and reported, and you are requested to investigate and implement it, etc.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Mingyuan Amusement Park The Mingyuan Amusement Park has been open for nearly a month. Due to the extreme heat, ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life flock to it.

<p>Lawsuit Involving a Man and a Dog Temporarily Suspended Due to Allegations of Bias by the Judge Chen Xinzhai, who pulls the bell at the Tianyun Building amusement park of Wing On Company, his wife Chen Lu, and Liu Xin'san, who teaches the games, were recently arrested by the Xinzha Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang of the legal group filed a lawsuit against them for obscenity, enticing a black dog to have sexual intercourse with a young woman, and performing in various hotels for profit. Judge Wu Tingqi has questioned them twice, as reported in this newspaper. However, this case has undergone slight changes since the last adjournment. The defendants believe that Judge Wu is biased in the trial, so they entrusted their agent, Lawyer Gan Lin, to submit a petition to the Special Court, requesting Judge Wu to recuse himself. The petition stated that there was a risk of bias in the trial. The reason for requesting the judge's recusal was that the plaintiff made a living pulling the bell at the amusement park of Wing On Company, earning a monthly salary of 70 yuan. He has four adopted daughters, the eldest of whom is 11 years old. She learns the craft with him and can earn more than 20 yuan a month by going to the church at night, so his monthly income is not bad. However, he was recently arrested by the Xinzha Police Station, who said that he enticed a dog to have sexual intercourse with his adopted daughter and performed in hotels, so he was prosecuted according to law. Regardless of whether the matter is fabricated or there are other circumstances, the trial judge should investigate in detail to obtain the truth in order to be convincing. However, Judge Wu has preconceived notions and is biased against the defendant, which cannot be said to be doing his best in the trial. The legal articles cited by the police station refer to the suspicion of the plaintiff's dog having sexual intercourse with a person, which constitutes a crime. The plaintiff believes that he has never done such a thing, so he cannot be convicted of a crime. There are also many doubts in the legal text. Even if it is assumed that such a thing did happen, and there is a special article in the law, it should also be investigated whether there was sexual intercourse, which is the only key to establishing the crime. However, Judge Wu did not investigate this point. When the plaintiff's representative lawyer was permitted by Judge Wu to ask the plaintiff's daughter about this point, Judge Wu suddenly prohibited it. What was his intention? The plaintiff's daughter testified that when she was four years old, the plaintiff asked someone to train her to have sexual intercourse with a dog. However, the plaintiff's puppy was given to him by someone last year, which all the neighbors know. When the plaintiff's lawyer requested to call witnesses on this point, Judge Wu turned a deaf ear. How can it be said that he does not have preconceived notions and intentions of bias? Moreover, the injury report of the four daughters is too simple, only stating that the skin is broken. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a re-examination, but Judge Wu did not express permission. This point is consistent with the provisions of Article 27, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law. Based on the above, Judge Wu has a risk of bias, so in accordance with Articles 27 and 28 of the Civil Law, this petition is submitted, requesting approval. Yesterday morning, this case was due for continued hearing. The Jiliang Institute also brought the four daughters, Chen Shuanglin, Genling, Guilin, and Caiyun, to the court. Judge Shen Zengshan still presided over the Second Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, recounted the case. Judge Wu then asked the defendants, Chen Xinzhai and Chen Lu, whether they had entrusted a lawyer to submit a petition. Chen et al. answered yes. Judge Wu then ordered Chen Xinzhai and Chen Lu to submit a petition for recusal, and the proceedings in this case should be suspended immediately. After the order was issued, the defendant's agent, Lawyer Gan, stood up and stated that there were two main points to report to the court: (1) Since the last court hearing, the defendant's buttocks have been beaten and swollen. (2) After this case occurred, someone introduced a lawyer to defend the defendant. This kind of lawyer introduction is not an illegal act. However, Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station led the defendant to the introducer's place a few days ago and searched it. This kind of illegal act should be urgently dealt with and remedied, etc. Judge Wu ordered to proceed separately according to law.</p>
<p>Three Girls Forced into Prostitution Temporarily Stay at the Jiliang Institute The case involves Chen Lianfang, a beautiful girl from Suzhou, and Zhu Huizhen, also from the same town, both 15 years old, and Xiao Jindi, a girl from Jiangbei, 18 years old, who was sold to Chen Mu, who lives at No. 5 Danshui Road, when she was young. The purpose of Ms. Chen's detention of these girls was to make them engage in prostitution, so 18-year-old Xiao Jindi has already been secretly engaged in this business. Recently, Ms. Chen went to Putuo to offer incense in order to atone for her sins. However, the three girls had a quarrel at home with their cohabitants, so they angrily escaped together on July 13. They were seen by patrolmen on North Yangzi Road who suspected them and took them to the police station, who handed them over to the First Special District Court. The court ordered the three girls to stay at the Jiliang Institute temporarily, and to track down Chen Mu. However, after the incident, Chen Mu's cohabitant reported the above situation to Putuo, and Chen did not return in order to avoid being implicated. She also sent a reply stating that the girls were so unscrupulous and that they had to let them act on their own. However, after receiving the letter, she fainted again, etc. Yesterday was another court date. The police station presented the previous situation, and the court brought the three girls to the court. Chen Lianfang and Zhu Huizhen stated that they were sold to Chen when they were young, and Xiao Jindi stated that she was forced to receive guests. Judge Shen Zengshan ordered the three girls to stay at the Jiliang Institute for care, and to track down Chen Mu for further verification.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Talk of the Olympics by Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The World Olympic Games is going on in full swing. The 10th session is being held in Los Angeles, USA. The Republic of China, which calls itself an Olympic member state, only has one person, Liu Changchun, participating in this session. In that full swing, it only counts as a spark of fire and a leaf of tea. Among the flags of more than 50 countries, at least the flag of the Blue Sky White Sun is flying together. The heinous Manchu puppet state also wanted to send athletes, asking a midget to be their bodyguard, to Los Angeles to show off. After all, they got the cold shoulder, making fools of themselves. On this point, we Chinese people can at least let out this frustration.</p>
<p>In 1920, the 7th Olympic Games was held in Belgium. The United States sent representatives to request that the next games be held in Los Angeles. However, the meeting had already decided that the 8th session would be held in Paris, France, and the 9th session in The Hague, Netherlands. It was not until this session that Los Angeles was allowed to host. The construction of all the Olympic villages was contracted out by people for millions of dollars three years ago, making them magnificent and indescribably grand and great. They hired specialist chefs from 40 countries. The admission tickets had 15 different colors. When the poor and weak Chinese people see such a grand spectacle, how can they not feel their eyes burning with heat and their mouths watering?</p>
<p>In the past, we did not have Chinese athletes participating in the games because we gave up our rights. No matter how the meetings rotated, it would never be our turn to host. Now, we have Liu Changchun, who has planted a seed in the world of sports. In the future, one will become ten, and ten will become a hundred. More and more athletes will be sent. One day, we will build a magnificent Olympic village near our capital, welcoming athletes from all over the world to compete against each other. This is not me bragging, but there is a possibility in reality. It only requires political stability! It only requires striving towards the goal of strengthening the national physique!</p>
<p>Old Tales of Chen Yingshi by Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The memorial tower of Chen Yingshi has already been erected at the intersection of Fangbang Road in Shanghai. Now, it is heard that a memorial hall will be established on Beijing Road. Those who held a spirit of great fearlessness before their death should be admired by future generations forever. A guest who was old friends with Mr. Yingshi described how Mr. Yingshi went to the Hu family to pay his respects. The Hu family used the Jiasheng Shousheng Monastery as the mourning hall. The guest was related to the Hu family and also went to socialize. Mr. Yingshi was at the same table that day. Mr. Yingshi had innovative ideas, saying that it was not suitable to set up a quiet Buddhist place in a prosperous city. These monasteries and temples could be rebuilt into libraries and memorial halls for celebrities. Those at the table who heard this did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, after several years, Mr. Yingshi became a revolutionary pioneer with great enthusiasm. He succeeded and died. After several more years, the old site of Shousheng Monastery was actually changed into Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall, which is beautiful and grand. Together with the memorial tower in Ximen, they are two major buildings to commemorate his achievements. This was probably beyond Mr. Yingshi's expectations during his lifetime. The guest also said that Mr. Yingshi was good at telling jokes. A person from the state of Chu died in his residence nearby. The person from Chu indulged in licentious activities and lost his life. His death was not to be pitied, but they still euphemistically said that it was due to acclimatization and illness. Mr. Yingshi then cleverly constructed a joke, saying that a Buddhist woman caught a louse on her body. If she released it, she would feel the pain in her skin. If she pinched it, she would violate the precept of not killing. Faced with this dilemma, she deliberated again and again and then placed the louse in the hair on her head, saying, "It is not possible to release it, and it is even more impossible to pinch it. It is better to let it die from acclimatization." Those who heard this sighed repeatedly.</p>
<p>Recent News from Wan Garden by Yi Qiu, sent from Wan</p>
<p>Three years ago, I spent half a year in Anqing. Now, due to some business, I have returned to this old place and traveled around for two days. I have four things worth recording, so I specially wrote them down and submitted them to this talk.</p>
<p>Wild flowers flutter around in disarray. Because Anqing is the capital of the province, prostitutes have always been as densely blooming as the wild flowers in the third month everywhere. The authorities at that time did not want to ban them, but they also had no way to ban them. Later, they simply let them be. Therefore, after Nanjing strictly banned prostitution, the power of prostitution in Anqing suddenly became rampant. Recently, the new director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, Zhang Benshun, took office.</p>
<p>Manjianghong - Gift to the Volunteer Army by Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Hot blood spurts into the sky. Don't soothe matters with a grieving heart like pounding. It is better for a man to be on the yellow sands and purple frontiers in the army. People on the walls compete to see the banner of the Han. In their hearts, they have long drafted the articles to quell the dwarfs. Pointing at the dogs and sheep, the number is exhausted this year. Zhang will punish them on behalf of Heaven. Qin and Yue, protect each other forever. National hatred, sweep away at the same time. Take the three thousand iron crossbows and shoot them down at the head of the tide. Drinking horses must still be near the blue sea. Holding a horizontal lance, I want to ascend Pengdao directly. Wait until the triumphant drums celebrate peace and prosperity. Embrace each other with open arms.</p>
<p>Visit to Guiyuan Temple by Cao Mengyu</p>
<p>Guiyuan Temple outside the city of Hanyang, I happened to see it after passing Qin Terrace. As soon as I entered the Zen gate, I saw the phenomena. Then I went to the stone bank to look at the _. Ten thousand worlds of earthly desires are transformed. Five hundred majestic figures are left out of sight. I sought _ scriptures in the abbot's room. Turning over the palm leaves, I certified Bodhi.</p>
<p>The first thing he did after that was to strictly ban prostitution. Recently, various branches have been arresting prostitutes. Every day, dozens of goddesses are arrested. Those who are arrested are either expelled or detained in a relief hospital. The numbers are indeed shocking. Yesterday, Director Zhang specially posted notices everywhere, with the sentence "I swear to use the success or failure of the prohibition of prostitution as a measure of my advancement or retreat." This shows his determination to ban prostitution.</p>
<p>River water is rising high. Anqing is usually eight or nine feet or one zhang above sea level. The river water is usually eight or nine feet or one zhang away from the shore. Because the terrain is extremely high, even last year's flood did not have any impact. Recently, the weather has been sunny for days in a row. For some reason, the river water has suddenly risen sharply. In low-lying areas around the China Merchants Wharf, the river water has actually surged ashore. This is truly a strange thing. However, the local newspapers have not recorded this, and the construction authorities have not paid attention to this, which makes people even more strange.</p>
<p>The Newly Built Park Anqing has always lacked places for leisure. Even the Linghu Lake and Yingjiang Temple, which are known as scenic spots, are very ordinary. Moreover, they are both very far from the city. It is truly an unbearably vulgar place. Now, a park has actually been built. Because it is located at the Confucius Temple, it is named Kong Yuan. Although the area inside is not large, the layout is quiet and pleasant. What is especially special is that there are flower sheds and green shade everywhere. It has been extremely hot recently. Every evening, visitors flock to it. It has actually learned the style of the Bansong Garden in Shanghai. All kinds of cold food, snacks, and tea are available. It has indeed brought a lot of face to Anqing.</p>
<p>Major Activities of Party Members Since the reorganization of the new provincial party headquarters, all the hotels in the city have simultaneously announced that they are fully booked after the arrival of nine special envoys. According to investigations, there are more than two thousand people who have come specifically to engage in party affairs work. This is truly a joke. Even if all the old members of the provincial party headquarters and the various counties in the province are eliminated, it will still be impossible to distribute them. Therefore, these nine special envoys have recently been surrounded by more than two thousand unemployed party members, making it difficult for them to breathe. They are crying out in pain. This is truly a laughable and lamentable thing.</p>
<p>Summer in Xuanwu Lake by Sui Cheng</p>
<p>Among the lakes and marshes of the capital, Xuanwu Lake is the largest. There is a park on the lake with towering green trees and bamboo groves everywhere. Pavilions and waterside pavilions are connected by winding paths. The scenery is quiet and elegant, making it an excellent place to escape the summer heat. Every time the sun sets, you can see fashionable women and young boys coming in droves. Some row boats on the lake, and some enjoy tea in the park, using it to dispel the summer heat. However, the lake water is like soup in the evening. When the breeze passes, the heat makes people feel faint. The tourists do not know this. They feel uncomfortable with the warm wind after rowing only a few miles and abandon their boats to go ashore. This is very common. Therefore, those who visit the lake should first visit the park. When the night is late and they want to return, they should then row a boat. At this time, the heat in the lake water has been completely evaporated. A small boat drifts in the middle of the stream. The light breeze points to the clothes, and the body feels cool. When they reach the other shore, the noise and heat have been completely washed away.</p>
<p>There are those who sell tea in the park. They set up seats at will under the paulownia trees and beside the bamboo groves. They do not light lamps, but the bright moon shines on people. It is very quiet. Therefore, on the nights of the third and fifth days of the month, the seats are always full of guests. However, after the full moon, the round moon gradually wanes, and the starlight is also faint. Although there are many tourists, there are few who enjoy tea.</p>
<p>Short News by She Yu</p>
<p>The domestic record company, Da Zhonghua, has long been praised by music lovers. The factory originally employed a Japanese technician. After the September 18th Incident, the company terminated the contract and dismissed him. Mr. Xu Jigong's son, Qinghai, the former general manager of the company, practiced in the recording section and mastered its secrets. Recently, he has formally presided over it, and has obtained the help of a British Jew, David. The products are no less than foreign films. My friend, Mr. Wang Shoucen, is the associate manager of the company and is planning development strategies. A month ago, he recruited outstanding ballad singers and broadly collected excerpts from storytelling, etc. Sample films have already been played in Zhongxi Pharmacy and Guohua Radio Station. Recently, the Ministry of Education, in order to be cautious about the national language, hired experts to leave standard national language recordings in the company. A representative was sent to Shanghai to supervise the matter. Mr. Wang has also booked Old Man Xiangbo to leave his _ during the autumn. I am a fan of the theater. My friend, Yu Lugong, Xu Xiaopu, one is good at the style of a bearded man, and the other is good at the style of Xun Huisheng. I went to the recording stations the other day, and I played the qin for accompaniment. According to Qinghai's report, the results are very perfect. However, I was trying recording for the first time, and I was inevitably criticized for being too careful. With the addition of precise electrical storage, when the film is completed in the future, it will first be broadcast on the radio for criticism from friends and then published.</p>

<p>Domestic Factories Worth Introducing (15) by He Gongxing</p>
<p>(25) Machine-Made Cigarette Box Factory</p>
<p>The small cigarette boxes containing ten cigarettes are the most frequently sold and are shipped the fastest. They can be divided into two parts: the box shell and the box core.</p>
<p>Box Shell Making Method: (1) Use a small cutting knife to trim the printed paper with the trademark. (2) Use a scoring machine to score and cut it into paper strips. (3) Apply glue with a glue machine (some also use manual labor). (4) Cut the box shell. A machine can cut one million box shells per day. A cutting knife can cut 70,000 to 80,000 pieces per person per day. One person is in charge of the machine, pushing the box shell, which has already been glued into a long strip, into the machine. One side is pushed in, and the other side falls from the machine.</p>
<p>Box Core Making Method: There are large-scale and small-scale methods. For large-scale methods: (1) First, arrange the knives. The workers who arrange the knives must be top-notch workers, and their wages are often 50 or 60 yuan a month. (2) Use a printing cutting machine. If the box core needs to be printed with words, the machine can print, cut, and score the box core at the same time. (3) Separate the box cores manually. (4) Sand the edges. (5) Send them to a thousand to a bunch. For small-scale methods, except that the second step needs to be divided into three steps: cutting, printing, and scoring the box core, the rest is roughly the same.</p>
<p>The so-called large-scale equipment mentioned above is the Shanggong Machine-Made Cigarette Box Factory at the end of Zhoujiazui Road in Shanghai, which uses this method to manufacture. Its machines are American-style and self-made. Each machine can produce 2 million box</p>
<h3 id="e160">Appeal from the Egg Industry Guild <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Petition to Withdraw the Newly Established Freight Rate Order</p>
<p>The transportation of egg yolks and whites was previously categorized as fourth class. Although the Ministry of Railways' new freight rate system in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930) reclassified them as second and third class, the Egg Industry Guild repeatedly petitioned and was granted a temporary suspension of implementation. Unexpectedly, this year there is another order to collect fees according to the new freight rates, scheduled to take effect on August 1st. Yesterday, the Egg Industry Guild telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting the withdrawal of the order. The telegram read: "Respectfully addressed to Minister Gu of the Nanjing Ministry of Railways: Regarding the freight classification of eggs, since the new regulations were revised in the 19th year of the Republic of China, we have repeatedly received your Ministry's understanding of the difficulties faced by businesses, continuing to charge according to the old classification. During this time, the egg industry has been as precarious as morning dew, and the extension of a lifeline until today has been entirely due to your Ministry's support. In May of this year, our fellow members suddenly received reports that egg freight rates would be charged according to the new classifications. In our anxious state, we painstakingly explained the decline of the egg industry over the years and petitioned your Ministry to postpone implementation, hoping to temporarily maintain the precarious situation. We have not yet received a response. We have recently learned that your Ministry has instructed all railways to immediately collect freight for egg transportation according to the grades specified in the newly revised freight classification table, with a trial period of one year, effective from August 1st. We believe that your Ministry's handling of egg freight rates involved issuing orders to various railways to solicit opinions, followed by discussions by the Freight Rate Committee, which cannot be said to be not cautious. If merchants could bear the burden, they would not dare to repeatedly petition. However, the egg industry is currently in a position of crisis. An investigation of the annual freight volume and revenue of various railways will confirm the industry's declining business. Further blows will inevitably lead to inability to sustain operations, resulting in closures. Your Ministry's intention to increase railway revenue will have the opposite effect, contradicting your Ministry's original intention of promoting national product exports. Furthermore, dried and fresh egg yolks and whites have historically been in the same class and could be packaged together. Now that they are classified into second and third classes, co-packaging is impossible, and there are no such large quantities for separate packaging. This is also a difficult problem to solve. Therefore, we urgently telegraph you, Minister, to promptly withdraw the order and instruct all railways to continue charging egg yolks and whites according to the fourth class to maintain the endangered industry. We are filled with trepidation as we await your command. The Shanghai Egg Industry Guild, respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Passenger Hangs Himself to Death Beside Bed <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Around midnight the night before last, a passenger arrived at the Tongshang Hotel at No. 42 Avenue Road. He was dressed in a white silk long gown and appeared to be a merchant. The hotel waiter, Lu Xianzun, led him to room number 89. He paid the room fee and registered on the logbook as Zhou Zuofu, 28 years old, merchant. Shortly after, Zhou rang the bell. He gave the waiter one silver dollar, instructing him to buy snacks, fruit, soda, and white roses. After purchasing them, the waiter delivered the items and the change to Zhou. Zhou drank alone, appearing cheerful. The waiter closed the door and went back to his room to rest. Around 5 a.m., when the early shift waiter came on duty, he noticed the light was still on in room 89. He peered through the crack in the door and saw that the passenger was not in bed, arousing his suspicion. He ran to report to the front desk, and they retrieved a spare key. Opening the door, they found Zhou had used his belt to hang himself from the ceiling above the bed. Upon touching him, they found he was already dead. They immediately telephoned the Xinzha police station, and officer number 1425 arrived and transported the body to Renji Hospital, then to the forensic examination office on Fellen Road for examination. It is reported that the deceased left behind a pair of glasses, a wallet, and some double-copper coins, which the officer took to the police station for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Bai Yuyou from Shandong, on the afternoon of the 31st of last month, was carrying four individuals: Zhang Zhangshi, Li Yingshi, Zhang Lishi, and Chen Xiaomei, to the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. They intended to take a certain ship to another port, the destination unknown. Suddenly, a quarrel erupted at the wharf. Patrol officer number 348 found them, and, suspecting their motives, arrested them all. The police chief ordered their detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Yao Zhaoqi presented the case, stating that the police station had provisionally prosecuted based on Article 257 of the Criminal Code regarding abduction. However, the case had not yet been fully investigated, and he requested a postponement for further examination. Judge Wang Gangxu questioned the defendants and then adjourned the hearing to a later date. The defendants remained in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Accomplice in the Liu Nianchun Kidnapping Case Held for Sentencing <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Liu Nianchun, manager of the Dingkang Gold Shop at No. 516 Tianjin Road, resided at No. 922 North Chengdu Road. At 6 PM on July 5th of the year before last, he was kidnapped with his wife while sitting in their car. The kidnappers demanded 40,000 yuan. The family eventually paid 20,000 yuan for his release. The police later apprehended a kidnapper named Yu Baocheng, who confessed and was sentenced to death and executed. Previously, the Jiaxing Road police apprehended Shao A'gen, a Ningbo native and driver at the Lili Automobile Company on Suzhou Road. He denied involvement during questioning at the First Special District Court. The victim, Liu Nianchun, was also unable to identify him. The court ordered further investigation and summoned witnesses, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that the original driver, surnamed Lu, was currently in the capital and requested to be questioned. Lu Liangyuan from Yangzhou testified that he was working at the Liu residence at the time, substituting for the car driver Lu Lanfu, who was ill. There were four kidnappers in total. One kidnapper boarded the car, pointed a gun at him, and forbade him from making any noise. They drove to Avenue Road, where the kidnappers forced him and the owner's wife (Liu's wife) out of the car, forbidding them to watch, under threat of death. Therefore, he could not identify the defendant. The defendant maintained his denial of being an accomplice. The court ordered arguments to begin. The police lawyer stated that Yu Baocheng, who was previously executed, had named an A'gen as participating in the kidnapping. The defendant was working as a driver at the Xinglong Automobile Company at the time and had pointed a gun at the victim. After the incident, the defendant worked as a driver for Attorney Zhang for only two days before going to Dalian. Therefore, the defendant was highly suspected. The defendant also retained a lawyer for defense. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>

<p>One Person Seriously Injured and Killed – Over Twenty People Detained</p>
<p>Xuejiabang is a pig market wharf in Nanshi, with rows of pig traders and workers, each with their own faction. Long-standing grievances had accumulated. Sun Jiwu, a Shandong native employed by a pig trader, was attacked on the morning of the 31st of last month, around 7 a.m., while walking out of the Changchunlou teahouse in Xuejiabang. The Jiangyin gang, along with over forty individuals, including several injured soldiers, attacked him with weapons, causing severe injuries and leaving him covered in blood. Police officers apprehended three injured soldiers: Qiu Hu, Liu Xiu, and Liang Huapei, and sent them to the District Court for detention. Sun further accused Zhang Xiaogen, Huang Guirong, Tao He, Xiaojiangyin, and others from the Jiangyin gang as the main perpetrators, requesting investigation, but the matter remained unresolved. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the Jiangyin and Shandong gangs were mediating the dispute inside the Xuejiabang teahouse. Unexpectedly, the Jiangyin gang suddenly gathered two to three hundred people, some with firearms. The Shandong gang was smaller in number, and while they had weapons, they lacked effective tools. A battle broke out, and the Shandong gang was defeated, resulting in three seriously injured and many slightly injured. A man surnamed Li suffered brain damage and is said to have died. The First Precinct of the First District received the report and dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene, detaining over twenty individuals fighting on the spot. Around noon, another Jiangyin man was arrested at Jixiang Lane in front of the District Court. All were detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau, then to the District Court for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Petition from the National Products Exhibition Hall <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Petition to Be Forwarded to the Mayor – Requesting a General Order to Promote National Products</p>
<p>Cao Zhendong, Director of the Shanghai National Products Exhibition Hall, submitted a document to Director Wu, stating: "Regarding the matter of a petition: National products are the foundation of national production, and promotion is the way to alleviate unemployment. In recent years, all countries have been raising tariffs and revitalizing national products in response to the global economic downturn to mitigate economic panic. For decades, our country has suffered from tariff agreements and economic aggression from imperialists, leading to a state of decline throughout the country. In recent years, the government has established special agencies to guide and promote national products, showing great enthusiasm for this cause. It has also raised its voice and awakened society, hoping to boost sales of national products and save the country from its imminent crisis. However, society still favors extravagance, and the people are superstitious about foreign goods. Despite long-term promotion, the results have been minimal. Currently, various products in our city are gradually reaching maturity. All daily necessities and Chinese and Western clothing have excellent products. Previously, foreign goods were indispensable, but now they are gradually being made domestically. However, due to the public's entrenched habits and lack of understanding of national products, manufacturers still face sales difficulties. In view of this, and noting that since the September 18th Incident, the public's patriotic sentiment has reached a peak, now is the time to promote national products, as the results will certainly be higher than in the past. Moreover, our city is the commercial center of the country, the focus of attention from both China and abroad. Citizens using national products is an example for the whole country in promoting national spirit and alleviating the declining market. The responsibility of our Hall is to learn from past experience, examine the situation, and promote national products. We believe that promotion should have persistence and discernment, with continuous publicity and a spirit of mutual encouragement. Based on these points, we have revised the simplified implementation measures in accordance with the principles of the Ministry's orders and the implementation methods issued by the Municipal Government as follows: (1) All government agencies should, as far as possible, use domestic products for office supplies. Leaders should also encourage civil servants to set an example by using domestic products for both Chinese and Western clothing. For household daily necessities, they should be directed to purchase national products or nationalized products. They should regularly talk to their children and wives about advocating the use of national products to cultivate a psychology and habit of loving national products. (2) The Education Bureau should be responsible for informing all primary and secondary schools before the start of the semester that all school equipment should be domestic products, except for those that are not available or have no substitutes. Student uniforms and underwear should be made purely of domestic products, and school rules should restrict students from purchasing the same foreign goods that are already produced domestically. Cultivate their diligence and love of domestic goods. Before the end of each semester, set a standard for promoting domestic goods in the current season and methods of publicity for students to work on during the holidays. Education inspectors should pay attention to the above points and set them as evaluation standards. Our Hall is collecting and appraising various national products. If you need to use them, you can come to the Hall to inspect them. We will provide convenience at any time to increase promotional efficiency. The above is for your review and approval. We request that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government and ordered to be implemented by all agencies to effectively promote national products. Whether it is appropriate or not, please examine and instruct us to follow."</p>

<p>Niu Lan and his wife, after being released from prison for medical treatment on bail by Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, and Yang Xingfo, have recovered their health. The Gulou Hospital sent two letters to the court requesting that they be taken back.

<p>Yu Baoquan, Qin Dianqing, Qin Fugeng, and others, farmers in Yugeng Lane, about three li south of the Hongqiao Town in West Shanghai, were robbed on the night of the 29th of last month. The police bureau is conducting a rigorous investigation. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jinxiang, a Taoist priest residing at No. 20 Zhanggeng Lane, about half a li east of Yujiatang, who was relatively well-off, was also visited by robbers. Around 11 PM the night before last (the 1st), over ten robbers speaking with mixed accents suddenly arrived and surrounded Zhang's front and back doors, shining flashlights through the windows. Zhang Jinxiang had just returned home from a Taoist temple and had not yet gone to sleep. Seeing the light, he knew something was wrong. He heard footsteps and urgent knocking on the door. Knowing it was a robbery, Zhang quickly took a gong and climbed onto the roof from the courtyard using a ladder, ringing the gong and shouting for help. Police Chief Li Guodong of the Hongqiao Town Police Station of the Sixth Precinct, along with patrol officers Wang Yucai and Wang Yilu, were patrolling nearby. Hearing the alarm, they chased after the robbers. The robbers noticed and opened fire to resist arrest. The police chief also drew his gun and returned fire, firing over ten shots. In the end, the robbers, realizing they were outnumbered, fled south. Police Chief Li, due to limited manpower and the darkness of the night, did not dare to pursue them, allowing them to escape. He immediately returned to the station and reported to Police Chief Bi Zhenhua, who yesterday dispatched Inspector Sun to investigate. A spent pistol cartridge was found in the victim's home, and two window panes were broken. Fortunately, the front door was sturdy, and the robbers were unable to enter, so there was no loss. However, the whole family was greatly frightened.</p>

<p>Shi Jingding, a Taoist priest from Pudong, around fifty years old, was operating in Shanghai and was addicted to opium. He often went to the Yanzike on the upper floor of the Sishi Chun Noodle Shop at No. 256 Avenue Cardes for his fix. Last month, when the French police raided the premises, Shi was inside and was arrested along with the others. After questioning at the court, the female owner of the opium den was sentenced to imprisonment and fined. Shi, as an opium user, was sentenced to one month of imprisonment and fined 20 yuan. Unable to pay, he was imprisoned for one day for every two yuan owed. He was released at noon on the first of this month, but he was sick due to withdrawal symptoms while in custody. When he was released, he was already in critical condition. He hired a rickshaw to No. 256 Avenue Cardes, but he was unable to move after getting off and sat on the ground. He died shortly after. The police found him and reported it to the police station, which sent a detective to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall mortuary. No relatives were found. The Second Special Court was notified yesterday morning and dispatched Wu, an examining coroner, to the mortuary. He confirmed that the deceased died of illness and ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and burial.</p>

<p>Jin A'er Fell Upside Down</p>
<p>At around 4 AM yesterday morning, a thief, Jin A'er from Suzhou, somehow managed to climb from the window into the bedroom of Ji Ruibing, a Ningbo native, at No. 3 Huachun Lane, Zhangjia Lane in the city. In the darkness, he stole a cheongsam and silk trousers hanging on the wall and placed them on the windowsill. Because the stolen goods were too few, he was still trying to open the trunk to steal more when Gu, who was asleep in bed, suddenly heard a tapping sound. Knowing something was wrong, he immediately jumped out of bed and turned on the light. In the light, he saw Jin stealing. Jin realized the light had been turned on and that he was in trouble. In his haste, he jumped out the window onto the street. Unexpectedly, as his body left the window, his feet were tripped by the electric wire outside. In an instant, he fell upside down, his head hitting the stone steps, causing a head wound and profuse bleeding. He fell unconscious to the ground. Seeing this, Gu immediately reported it to the Second Precinct of the First District. Police Chief Li went to the scene and found Jin's head had a large hole, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. He also investigated the details of the theft at the Gu residence and reported back to the station.</p>
