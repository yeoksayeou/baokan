<p>顏李談判久已成功互派大使不久實行美承認蘇俄爲期不遠</p>
<p>（南京）我與俄絶交五載、十二日由顏惠慶與李維諾夫在日内瓦互換文件、聲明復交各情如次、</p>
<p>（絶交經過）一九二七年四月張作霖在北京因俄使館事件、俄召回代辦以示抗議、同年十二月粤共變事件、國府撤銷俄駐華使館承認、至此俄駐華外交人員全召回、一九二九年春中東路問題發生、五月俄停止我外交人員待遇國府召回使領、國交遂完全斷絶、</p>
<p>（復交經過）一九三零年、我派莫德惠等赴俄、開中俄會議、商東路商約復交諸問題無結果、中央對復交意見亦未一致、本年六月六日中政會决議復交並商訂互不侵犯條約、本擬秘密進行但不幸洩露、致遭日本極力破壞、日本前任駐俄大使廣田並建議與俄訂互不侵犯條約、松岡赴歐過俄時、亦與加拉罕談判、但無誠意、且利害衝突未成、我方則仍秘密進行、羅外長訓令顏惠慶並　機宜與李維諾夫、在日内瓦秘密談判、蓋二人均出席軍縮會、就近接洽較便利、至莫斯科則無法進行顏李談判屢斷屢續、遂趨接近、我因國際形勢、毅然同意先行復交、雙方意見遂全一致、二週前本社記者遇羅外長、羅笑謂記者云、松岡活動完全失敗於我人之手、並謂十日後有事實表現、蓋顏李談判已成功、李已返俄請示、日前蘇炳文退俄日要求引渡、經加拉罕嚴拒、此固由於俄嚴守中立、但亦固對我已諒解、係善意表示、本社記者是時曾向羅外長詢蘇之安全問題羅謂蘇决可安全返國、再詢復交時期、羅答一二日内事蓋李已由俄赴歐十二日下午五時李顏談十分鐘、即互換復交文件</p>

<p>（美承蘇俄）日向俄活動時、美俄活動亦密切、已有相當諒解、羅斯福明年三月就職後、第一步即正式承認蘇俄、</p>
<p>（國際形勢）專家觀察此次國聯大會、因英袒日、小國制裁暴日主張遭反對、而國聯維持正義和平威信、亦一掃無遺、中俄復交後形勢當有轉變、美承認俄後、反日空氣將更濃厚（十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>中俄復交上月二十即商定吾人爲和平事業着一先鞭</p>
<p>（日内瓦）我國首席代表顏惠慶今日語中央社記者云、中俄復交談判、始於本年四月原擬訂立互不侵犯條約、但兩國現已同意先行恢復外交關係、在十一月二十日即蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫抵日内瓦之翌日、即將此事完全商定、顏氏對於躬自成就此項於兩大國互助上必需之盛舉、表示欣快、並謂因李維諾夫與本人均在日内瓦出席軍縮會議、實爲成就此事之絶好機會、　軍縮會議雖尙未獲得良好結果、而吾人已爲和平事業着一先鞭矣、顏氏最後鄭重宣稱、中國對於與蘇俄恢復友好關係、實具有甚深之誠意云（十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中俄復交之協定、乃今春李維諾夫在日内瓦参加軍縮會議時即已開始之談判結果、中國原議爲不侵略條約、但蘇俄不允、因不欲以此爲恢復外交關係之條件也、中國後遂放棄不侵略條約之原議、談判數月後、乃有復交之形成、聞復交後、並不銷滅將來締結不侵略條約之可能性、他日兩國願意時、仍可締成此約或他種形式之協定、中代表顏惠慶博士今日發表關於中俄復交之言論如下、余得代表中國、恢復對俄之外交關係、甚爲欣幸、當余以中代表資格、前來日内瓦参加軍縮會議時、余即抱有一種感想以爲在太平洋海岸之兩大國爲和平起見、應恢復尋常關係、此種感想、李維諾夫亦具有之、吾人了解兩國復交之不容稍緩、已有多時、今李維諾夫之蒞此、乃被認爲實現此事之絶好機會、李頓報告書之曾言及蘇俄、復用請美俄参加　九特委會討論之建議、愈可證明中俄復交之需要、中國朝野皆甚誠摰决定增進對此鄰國之友交想俄國定亦有同情也云、（十二日透路社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）蘇聯外長李維諾夫今日接見報紙記者、發表關於中俄復交之談話、李氏謂此種完全常態之舉動、無　加以解釋、惟斷絶邦交或拒絶與他國維持邦交、始需解釋、蓋此種現象、足以阻碍國際常態關係、甚至影響和平也、李氏繼謂數年前中俄斷絶邦交之事、現可不提、當時情形與蘇聯殊無關係、蘇聯之政策爲與他國保持常態邦交、絶對不認斷絶或拒絶與他國之邦交、爲解决國際問題之　宜方法、各國與蘇聯用此法解决糾紛者、均未稱其有益、中國當亦有此感、且目前遠東之糾紛、多少亦與太平洋岸各國未能保持完全常態邦交之事有關、蘇聯人民對中國民族之求保持獨立主權與國際平等、素抱最大同情、蘇聯政府對中國之友善、可於其單獨放棄不平等條約·治外法權·及所有沙皇帝國主義在中國所取得之權利、及其改中東路爲中俄共營之商業機關、得一良好之證明、即因此種友善感情、蘇聯與中國在一九二四年成立正式邦交、而今日之復交、亦爲發於此種感情、非屬偶然也、李氏結譣論謂、蘇聯與他國無任何秘密條約及結合、故其與一國增善關係、不致影響及於對他國之關係、此種政策、爲鞏固世界和平之唯一正道、蓋惟在各國均維持常態關係之情形下、始能切實言及國際合作以求和平、嚴守國際和平協定及建立有力之國際組織、深信所有擁護和平及國際合作者、當樂聞中俄二大國恢復邦交之消息也云、（十三日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>（東京）日外部對於中俄復交問題、早已明瞭中俄兩國積極在進行、不過未能相信在短時間能實現耳、今晨日外部突然接到日内瓦日代表部正式報告、頓使日外交界狼狽異常、聞内田外長今晨召集各司長討論應付新局面、關於日俄不侵犯條約、蘇炳文移交問題、及國聯對策、均加以審愼討議、（十三日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政界聞中俄復交消息、並不驚訝、但對於此項新發展　頗煩惱、按日本曾於十一月四日向莫斯科探詢顏惠慶博士以中俄復交之議商諸李維諾夫消息是否確實、當時李氏承認中國確曾提出此議、但兩國對此尙未有行動、同時蘇俄外並答稱、莫斯科準備談判、但反對在談判期内以一九二四年條約支配兩國間之關係、聞中國原請依某種條件恢復邦交、茲因蘇俄有加入中日爭案調解委員會之可能故乃撤回所提出之條件、因是獲蘇俄之同意云（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）政府發言人宣稱、中俄復交、日本極爲歡迎最擾害世界和平之分子、今已携手、日本正好與之對抗、今日列强應加决定之問題、爲是否容許破壞力抑團結力主治東方、中俄復交、已明白提出此事件、若將滿洲前途與此並列、則已覺得比較的無意味云、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）關於中俄復交問題、日外交部得訊甚激奮、但於外交　禮有關、負責人不肯批評、據内部對此問題有兩種觀察、一則以爲於日明利、一則謂於日不利、有利論者謂中國因英法袒日、國聯不維持公理、遂出計引俄牽制英法、但英國因埃及印度各殖民地民族自覺、漸萌反英而謀獨立、蘇俄又站在弱者地位、援助反英自主運動、故英怕俄又恨俄、今中國與俄國接近、英必盡量帮助日本壓迫中國、求日在遠東助英壓制各殖民地之獨立運動、法國爲反俄盟主、恨俄最甚、又爲安南民族革命須假重日本、無論如何、英法因此將再堅决袒護日本、不利論者則謂國聯態度未决之今日、蘇俄承認僞國之希望將絶、東三省各地義軍以爲俄國是我友邦、已得俄助、日軍都不必怕了、因此恐增大義軍抗日反滿之空氣與力量、如此則四面皆敵、在精神上所受打擊不少、殖民地民族崇俄爲救世主、則對殖民地之精神上影響非淺、蘇炳文移交自更無接洽餘地、國聯會員中各小國素憤英法利用國聯壓迫小國、英法如再進一步明白表示其袒日態度、則國聯由失各小國之實質維持、而將失去世界之精神維持故英法之袒日、以不破壞國聯爲限度如國聯臨危、則英法亦不得三思猛省、袒日之力量當稍爲薄弱、因有此種環境、於日本實不利也云云、（十三日華聯電）</p>

<h3 id="c18">中蘇復交與國際現勢晦 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>㈠中蘇兩國之關係</p>
<p>我國與蘇聯。自一九二九年七月中東路事變而後。尋常外交關係。即已完全新絶其後雖曾以地方特殊原因有領事駐剳。但僅能視爲一種因勢制宜之臨時手段。殊不能謂爲有正常的外交關聯也。及莫德惠氏赴莫斯科。遲滯復遲滯一再商量仍無結果而中蘇兩國壤地相接西起於新疆之蒲犁。東至於吉林之　門。犬牙交錯綿亘至一萬餘里現世界中無論任何國家。皆未有地域相接如此密切者。雖中蘇之間接壤區域。不爲叢山峻嶺。即屬長江大河。且遠在苦寒之邊陲不免於形勢疏隔但迄至今日。舟車便利。益之以航空。山河脩阻有如隔户中蘇兩國。政體雖亦互異。所奉主義又各不同然而國際情勢之推移東亞和平之不可不護持。則世界各國皆具同感中蘇復交運動。即醖釀於和平的先機中矣。</p>
<p>㈡中日蘇之三角關係</p>
<p>日本瓦傳來中蘇復交之電訊。本報趕速揭載。藉表其維護和平歡迎復交之微忱。設使中蘇之間不發生一九二九年七月之不幸事件。或發生而能早日解决。恢復正常國交者。則瀋陽事變縱未可幸免。而日閥兇横或稍歛跡。至少在中東路沿綫一帶不至如今日之糜爛。北滿境内。尙可保全。對國聯交涉。對公理正義之追求。恐亦不至全爲日人所利用。借僞造之案件。作現成之事實也。</p>
<p>東北現勢。在南滿一帶經濟實權。均操諸日本手中。近年以來奉海鐵路及洮昂路之興築。雖未足以與日本帝國主義。相頡頏。民族資本之奮起。則爲不可掩之史實因此而招惹日本之極度忌恨而新興勢力。究未豐滿。殊難與强敵爭一日之短長。對横穿吉黑之中東路。於聯精圖治之蘇聯。反置之化外。使日本更得而因利乘便。九一八事變。遂一變。再變擴大蔓延至於東北三省。設使再不收拾。禍且及於華北矣。</p>
<p>所幸者於國聯大會。毫無結果僅有拖延之餘。顏惠慶代表在日内瓦之言論。「余得代表中國。恢復對俄國外交關係。甚爲欣。幸···余即有一種感想以爲太平洋海岸之兩大國爲和平起見。應恢復尋常關係。···」同時顏惠慶代表與蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫氏所交換之文件。皆謂「本國政府亟願爲和平起見。增進兩國間之友誼。故决定認尋常外交與領事關係。業已從今日起正式恢復矣。」吾人固不敢謂中蘇恢復國交。即爲遠東問題之解决。更不敢望中蘇復交。即有若干意外之助力。然而吾人確知中蘇國交恢復之。後匪特在一般的商業上增多便利。即政治的外交的。不致因隔閡之故而資人以利用之工具。爲東北將來計。至少可减去敵方之便利。</p>
<p>㈢美蘇形勢之變遷</p>
<p>中蘇復交。在我國内部顧慮之。外國際間所最應注意者。厥爲列國之對華關係。蓋我國在東北。已介乎兩大國之問。無所適從。在内地尤居乎列强環伺之。下更易受制然而太平洋風雲日急。日美關係漸趨惡。化彼日本軍閥。爲運用其政略起見。且不惜以松岡洋右與蘇聯極意週旋。冀得深切之諒解以便對美。合衆國際此時會。已由上院外交委員會提出美蘇復交之議實現固尙須時。日商務縱暫見一時的低落。而羅斯福新總統就職之後。爲解决對日問題起見。爲正常的商務起見。皆將不免舊事重提。恢復美蘇國交又可預料也</p>
<p>㈣法蘇關係之急轉</p>
<p>法蘭西與蘇聯戰後十五年來。一則爲「安全保障。」日夜焦思。對波蘭之安全。旣恐德意志之侵入。復畏「赤化」思想之蔓延，故防範嚴密而戒備週詳也孰意近年來此種假想。已逐日月而减少。法國爲維持其西歐優勢。亦不得不遠親蘇聯。以减小敵方之助力。而使其「安全」得一重更深厚之保障。再則世界經濟衰頽。法國需求市塲蘇聯恰爲歐。洲最佳良最有望之投資塲所。於是法蘇二國由尋常國交進而訂立互不侵犯條約矣。在東北問題緊張時期中歐洲形勢竟然驟變丨丨法蘇由仇方而變爲友好。豈得無因。而世界情勢之轉換。恐將變封銀而爲相對的開放。</p>
<p>㈤我國應有之努力</p>
<p>我國處此變換期中。萬難再落人後。矧値大敵當前。尤不可動制機先。際此千鈞一髮之秋。我國政府。竟能排除萬難。竪。立獨特之外交路線。本自身之立塲　然對蘇聯恢復國交。不可謂非能適應時會。雖不免遭敵方之忌。難保不造作妖言。以淆惑國際視聽。然而爲遠東平和之確立。爲民族生存之爭鬭。自當勇往直前。打破日本軍閥主義之卑劣行爲。扶植人類「公理正義」具獻身犧牲之精神。向前邁進。</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國特委會昨日舉行非公開會議、英外相西門仍繼續發表對於我國不利之言論、主張以國聯大會本年一月十一日之含混的决議、爲調解之基礎、而不主張引用李頓報告書中不利於日本之事實爲根據、（十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）中國代表顏惠慶日前提出牒文、堅請國聯會按照盟約第十五條第四節、决定確實日期、以便公布關于中日爭端之報告書、十九國委員會開會時、曾審閱此項牒文、其内容要點如下、一敝國政府準備依照業經指定之基礎、接受調解辦法、此層十二月六日余在非常大會已有宣言、惟日本政府態度經其代表陳述者、甚爲固執、若此種態度不加變更、則調解辦法成功之希望極屬微薄」云云、十九國委員會對此項調解手續、業已研究、解爲甚屬困難、因旣不能涉及爭端之内容而若干原則則當予以維持故也、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>掛舉國一致内閣招牌的齋藤、以海軍耆宿受命於大難當前之際、陸軍部内硬得比　鐵還史硬、動輒　指使　所屬的右翼團體輕則用恐嚇手段、重　用手槍、而主張立憲政治的政友會、有的附合軍部有　高唱憲政常道論、對於現内閣却都極表不滿特别是預算案公佈而後、雖然沒有依照軍部的意見增加租稅、可是十萬萬日金的公債加在人民身上、也得罪了許多的資本家高橋　是雖是政　會的元老、也壓不住這樣的不平民政黨雖有願作御用黨的意思、無如議席過少也沒有什麽大的力量、所以齋藤内閣成立之初、就有人估量牠的壽命最長也不過三個月或半年、</p>
<p>現在已經半年了、牠總是在動搖當中穏定着、在各派互競之中得到一時的平衡、六十四届議會將於本月二十四日正式開幕、時間也近了、衆議院各派的態度確是値得注意、并且各派議員　對立都由暗中活動而尖銳化表面化了、</p>
<p>首先我們看到占有二百九十八個議席的政友會、　在齋藤内閣中有三個閣員但并不以此爲滿滿足自重派雖很願意援助齋藤内閣可也要表明自己的態度、在内閣方面、曾由高橋和三土兩位就財政及鐵道等帮忙、在外交方面有松岡洋右的日内瓦大活動、雖對齋藤常常表示不滿可是爲大局起見、還是以爲該依照非常時内閣的方向前進、在這時候就要完全清算齋藤内閣與政友會的關係、要打倒齋藤内閣、自然更非其時了、而强硬派就大不相同了、他們以爲齋藤内閣戴著非常時的假面具、號爲非政黨的超　主義、實質上是官僚内閣的再生、是日本立憲政治史上極不祥的事件這種情狀、讓多存在一天、則對憲政的發達多一天的妨碍、使其政黨政治日就衰微、况且所謂非常内閣是救濟非常時期的、現在匡救時局的預算旣已成立、則　的使命大半已經消解了、如果戀棧不去、的確留給後人以極不良的映象、致現時的政治於不可收拾、所以該趕快恢復憲政常道、組織政黨内閣、假如齋藤内閣留戀不去、則政友會當本自由的立場、公然顯示其政策宣佈與齋藤内閣絶緣、不過該派的鬥將森恪現正在臥病之中、萬難出席雖然還有許多人表不不滿、即政友會内部也恐難於統一、所以議會爭鬥之中、政友會黨内的情勢、也很値得注意、</p>
<p>民政黨論議席只有一百二十二個、縱使齋藤辭職、政權也不會落到民政黨手裏、這是誰都知道的事所以民政黨旣受政友會的壓迫、又感軍部的兇橫要自己建立一個政治目標、事實上是沒有什麽力量的、於是還是希望非常時内閣的再現、如果這次組織非常内閣、據政治界一般觀測大概是宇垣一成（現任朝鮮總督）起拜大命、因此民政黨諸人盡力和宇垣發生良好的關係、預備在將來要比現在占更優勢地位假如由政友會組閣的話、與其掛協力内閣的招牌僅出幾個不相干的閣員、不如讓政友會組織單獨内閣回復憲政常道、民政黨還可以準備再起、所以這時候的民政黨對齋藤内閣是很願意作御用黨、對將來的宇垣、則臨機應變製造上台的機會、</p>
<p>安達謙藏所領導的國民同盟、已於十一月二十二日正式結黨、現在保持純粹在野黨的地位、與現内閣沒有什麽特殊的因緣、所以牠對於明年度的豫算、對通貨膨脹政策、對外匯的慘跌、對國民生活的極端不安、對財政的巨大缺陷、一切的一切、都保持着批評態度、其主張雖沒有實行的機會、而在議會中對現政府的攻擊、是會相當的激烈、</p>
<p>無產政黨各派合計、社會大衆黨的議員三名、國家社會黨一名、由社會黨脫離出來、依然是無產派的一名、不過五個議席、在議會當中幾乎沒有什麽地位其發言也不過是發言而已、影響很小然而在旣成政黨之中、資本主義與軍國主義圍攻之下也有牠特殊存在的價値、雖不能影響議會、却對於瘋狂的羣衆有一點解熱作用、</p>
<p>齋藤内閣的壽命、議會政治的前途都好像要在六十四届議會表現出來不過政友會内在的矛盾太多、很不容易取齋藤而代之如果齋藤倒台、則混沌恐怕比現在更甚、繼之而起的至少須與軍部有因緣纔能站得住罷、（一九三二·十二·七日於東京）</p>

<p>本案發生伊始、雖迭見　載一切、但尙不能完全明瞭、據眞茹法醫研究所所長林幾云、宜興南門外顯親寺、自省保安步兵第四團奉命移駐該寺後、後院般若堂右首數間、卽劉爲醫務所、左首一間、爲寺僧堆置雜物、封鎖甚固、醫務所内看護兵常川信宿、間有病兵入内、是時每夜空屋内常有哭聲、聲且銳　、在所士兵、警惶奔避當由第九連連長樊正文報告前情、與第三營營長許其進同往察看、果聞哭聲、頓生疑心、當於翌日下午、督同寺僧兵士等啟門查勘見室中堆積殘破門窗户扇及桌凳等器具、内中類似血跡、因復拆卸一部份地板、則發現破爛衣服襪褲各一、至此疑竇更生、當卽以電話報告該部、邀同縣府公安局等代表蒞營會勘、則發覺内角一部份土地頗鬆、遂督率士兵發掘尺餘先發現先面毛巾一塊、有隠微血跡、並有常凈兩字標記、又無柄菜刀及刨刀各一把、均污銹、大小骨骼數塊、於是卽將所得物件、攝影存儲、一方將大略經過情形、擬成草案、内述此案可疑處有五點、呈請上峯及縣府查辦、一面復於深夜置扶乩台、叩問凶僧姓名、及該案眞相、嗣果顯靈、並悉死者女性、夏莊橋人、旋復遣人至夏莊橋查詢、果有是人、數年前確有一女失踪云云、此本案情形也</p>

<p>汪自新君訊··我在二十一歲的那一年便在高中畢業。在學校的成績。各科都很好’師長都說我是個有希望的青年’我自己亦覺得前途很光明的。畢業以後’因爲家庭經濟困難’不能升學，我也不失望，我始終以爲就是不能升學，我戰靠自己能找到相當的職業。果然，我靠着自己的一支筆，考進了某公司。經理先生看我的文章字體都很好，便派了我管理文牘的事。我得知以後，非常高興，以爲這正是我之所長了；因爲在學校裏時我也曾在刋物上常常投稿，並担任過一年的校刋編輯。這商店裏的文字當然更淺易了。不料第一次便碰了一個釘子，使我灰心到萬分。···公司新出了一種貨品，要把商標向商標局立案註册，我便擬了一篇公文。不料經理先生看見了，冷笑了一聲說，「並不要你做文章啊!我當下不覺凉了半截，心想，這難道不是做文章嗎？但又不敢說出口來···聽了經理的話，把從前的舊底稿翻出來一看，我不禁灰心起來。···從前在學校時做了一篇邀友人賞菊書曾得到九十八分，現在滿不是那麽一回事！先生，我從前所學的難道於我完全無用的麽，從前師長的誇獎難道都是騙我的麽？這還是學校不對呢，希師不對呢，還是我自己不對？這種錯處應該誰負其責？可有方法補救呢？我想和我有同樣困難的一定很多，先生，願你做我們前途的明燈！覆··足下倜儻不君，抱負不凡，無任欽佩所詢問題可約爲兩點··</p>
<p>所學非所用現在此語已成爲一般的口頭禪，譬如學成工程專家以後却當個敎授之類。此皆由社會不能用或能用而彼所學末必可用。而足下之情形尙不能歸入此類。蓋學校所授者原理而已，常識而己。能敎人以規矩而不能敎人以方賀。天下之事事物物無涯岸··舉一以推百。敎育已盡其能事矣··是固在學者能運用其所知以適應事物··天下决無刻板文章也。足下年方二十一已畢業高中，其天資之高不揣而知。徵以學校成績之優良，目前雖小有困難，不久當能克服之，故㈡無所用其「灰心」也。大凡事業之成就必經若干之困難。求進愈銳。困難之來。灰心愈甚··是必頼毅力克服之。苟小遇挫折便爾心灰意懶。是决非成大事者之所爲。足下自信甚强，抱負亦大，竟爲經理之令笑而「凉了半截」。毌乃懦乎？將來或有事使足下自頭頂凉至脚跟者，正吾輩青年之「盤根錯節」也。且經理並未冷笑一聲而遽下令逐客，方令足下參閱舊稿，此正猛求上進之機會，豈可坐失乎。再說此種文牘文字所異在體製，至文理固與學校作文同··從前所學正是基礎未可遽廢也。足下鼓勇前進，光明自不遠矣。</p>

<p>— 齊辯</p>
<p>玉妹：</p>
<p>一夜又過去了，此刻是十月十一號的早晨。每晚都是如此，我的兩手緊緊地在抱住你，抱住你親吻，對着你微笑，我完全忘記了你不在我的身邊，抱着的只是我自己的硬的骨頭，消瘦的身子。···</p>
<p>玉妹，我是無話可說了，一切我都對你說過，這幾天來的情感是無法描寫的，我的苦悶一天天深刻化了，以前我的忍耐，現在再也忍耐不住了，我的呐喊，我在長吁短嘆，我頓足，有時我簡直氣得馬上想毁滅了我，毁減了一切的女人，毁滅這整個的世界！</p>
<p>我眞想不到我是這樣可憐的，看見的只是一對對挽着手走的情人，一雙雙細語纏綿的愛侣，我爲什麽沒有這種幸福呢？笑話，一切我都比他們强，這是事實，我特别了解女人的心理，理解愛情的眞諦，而又對愛情如此專一，如此負責，爲什麽我沒有愛人呢？不丨爲什麽愛人不在我的身邊呢？天！難道這是我的命運嗎？難道有什麽在捉弄我，故意要使我多受幾年苦才得到幸福嗎？玉呵，一切都操在你的手裏，你終久是我的，何必故意這　「姗姗其來遲」呢！你知道嗎？青春是不可再的呵，雖我我們的精神永遠是青春的，我們的心永遠像孩子般天眞，柔嫩，我們的愛情永遠像火山般燃燒，但時光究竟是可寳貴的啊！唉！爲什麽我們要天涯地角分别呢？爲什麽你要給我苦吃而自己也陷於孤零呢？</p>
<p>玉妹，這幾天的生活我不忍告訴你，的確，我在摧殘自己，整天整晚我都沉醉在汾酒裏，我每回從外面喝得醉薰薰地回來，腦筋裏昏亂到一切都不知道，只有你的影子還在我的面前，我扶着樓梯，以爲是你的白藕般的手臂，我緊緊地握住子牠，我低下頭去吻牠，然而，唉！牠終久是樓梯呵，牠是一根沒有知覺的木頭呵！</p>
<p>倒在床上了，我鞋子衣服都沒有脫，被窩自然沒有蓋上便睡覺了，這一覺一直要睡得第二天早晨才醒。玉妹，聰明的你，總完全明白了吧？爲什麽我要拚命地喝酒呢？爲了怕失眠，爲了怕相思的漫漫長夜不能度過，爲了怕對着你的相片而使我苦痛欲死···唉！我的摯愛的玉呵，你忍心看到你的恒哥這樣蹧蹋自己嗎？他的身體就是你的身體，他的健康就是你的健康呵！</p>
<p>我眞不忍摧殘我的身體，我也並不是因了失戀而發牢騷，故意喝酒，我實在壓　不了我的一顆思念你的心，我晚晚都是爲了想你而失眠，而流淚！</p>
<p>唉！玉妹呵，我能說什麽呢？一切都是經濟製造出來的罪惡，一切都是經濟製造出來的痛苦，我能說什麽呢？···</p>
<p>你太殘忍了！我眞想不到你會這樣對待我的。爲什麽一封信也不給我呢？我只要每天看到你一封甜蜜的信，我一定得到很大的安慰，决不會如此蹧蹋自己的身體，陷入不可救拔的苦海之中。平，你爲什麽沒有信來呢？難道有了什麽意外嗎？</p>
<p>·······</p>
<p>痴愛着你的，永遠屬於你的奴僕恒。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>玉妹的覆信</p>
<p>恒先生：請你少費點時間吧，這樣的信，我簡直看都看不懂呢！李玉</p>
<h3 id="c278">「儍」與「聰明」 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 紫霞</p>
<p>對於歐美各國許多驚人的發明，朋友們常有這樣的感慨；唉，西洋人眞是太聰明了！這意思是嘆服西洋人聰明而自慚中國人之不及。其實，中國人何嘗？說中國人傻的，自己纔眞是傻人。</p>
<p>據聰明人的見解，凡事都應該「坐享其成」。譬如牛辛苦地種了田，等到田禾長出之後，馬便很閑逸的去吃，牛是多麽傻，而馬則是多麽聰明，中國人便是這樣，丨丨不願意做一條賣力的傻牛。</p>
<p>不信碼？你只拿「牛」和「馬」的公式去推，譬如人家發明了電燈，我們可以利用來打牌，人家發明了蒸汽機，我們可以利用來旅行，人家發明了飛機，我們可以利用來助長内戰，人家發明無線電，我們可以躺在沙發上安閑地聽，甚至於人家發明了六○六，我們可以更大胆的去幹「才子」的「風流韻事」，人家埋頭在研究室裏，窮畢生的精力，甚至孫而子子而孫的苦苦研究和不斷的實騐，等到實騐成功，我們則安然「坐享其成」，你想這是何等的合算；所以，中國人並不傻，中國人才是眞聰明。</p>
<p>假使牛頓是一個中國人的話，我想當他看見那熟而紅的蘋果從樹上落下的時候，他一定會毫不遲疑的趕快拾來幾口嚼吃，他想的一定是「這蘋果味道還不錯」，或是「最好再落一兩隻下來」，而决不會　想「這蘋果爲什麽不向上飛」？更决不會因這個傻問題而去埋頭做　研究。幸而牛頓是外國人，所以，這傻瓜終於因這隻蘋果而發現了地心引力三大定律。</p>
<p>在我們的祖先中，據說也有過一個呌做愚公的大傻瓜。那阻碍行路的大山雖說終於被他和他的子子孫孫移走，但那聰明人智叟的冷笑聲却至今還隠若可聞。這一笑，便笑斷中國人的傻氣，因此中國人世世代代都成了聰明人。</p>
<p>然而，聰明人，記着，聰明人有時也會被聰明所誤呵！</p>
<h3 id="c279">巴黎的愛斐爾鐵塔 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 直生</p>
<p>高薑入雲，矻立在巴黎塞納河畔的愛斐爾鐵塔，是世界最偉大的建築之一。此塔爲「法蘭西共和百年」的紀念物，其建築之雄偉，莊嚴，是以使市民及旅客對此知所景仰，因而引起個人的自奮與自勉，同時此塔對於巴黎的美觀上，也是狠有關係的。</p>
<p>塔高三百米突，作長方形，全部以鋼條架成，塔基分四足，所佔面積極廣。由下至上，逐漸縮小，共分三層，最下層有餐室，咖啡店，報　等設備，以供游人臨時需要，頂層已闢爲無線電台，游人現已不能攀登極頂了。</p>
<p>登鐵塔，要從正面右側塔下所開的門内乘升降機上升。同時，塔中建有螺旋形的樓梯，可以步行迥轉而上。</p>
<p>每當日麗風和的時候，攀登到塔的極端，恍如置身天際。由此俯眺巴黎，眞是驚心駭目，偌太的巴黎市區，可以一覽無餘，塞納河蜿蜓如一條素練，附近的街道仄小到不可言喻，往來的車輛和行人，只不過如微小的動物一般在蠕動罷了。一到黃昏，巴黎的燈火如萬點繁星，横亘於巴黎中心的塞納河，更顯得分外瑩白，景色之美，眞是無與倫比。</p>
<p>可是這能强烈地刺激人們的感覺的愛斐爾鐵塔，在黑夜已成爲Ｃｉｌｒｏｅ汽車廠的廣告塔。塔的四週，用各種顏色的電燈，由頂端直到末層，連貫綴成Ｃｉｔｒｏｅｎ七個字母，時隠時現，卽遠離巴黎一二十基羅米突的地方，也能看得十分清晰。美術史上有名的建築，至此也就完全商業化了</p>

<h3 id="c280">我理想中的愛人 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 劍風</p>
<p>「知好色則慕少艾·」這句話似乎是說明人類生來就具有一種追求愛情的本能。據一部份生理學家和心理學家研究的結果，這種本能比較其他任何本能都要來得强烈。愛的衝動雖是人人具有的，但我們要達到求愛的目的，要找到一個適合我們理想中的對象、却是一件極不容易的事情！因此·我想來談談我理想中的愛人：同時希望女同胞們也來談談她們所要求的對象。</p>
<p>現在就我熟悉的幾種女子來談一談吧。我覺得日本女子固然有一種婀娜動人的體態，温柔婉囀的音調，但是她們那種半野蠻式的服飾，尤其是她們那種母牛似的蹣跚的步法眞使人夠受：同時她們對於丈夫那種奴隸式的服從，也令我感到莫明其妙的不快。賢妻良母的主張何嘗不好，不過我總覺得男女兩方須互相服從，互相敬愛才有趣味，若像日本女子那樣尊男子若天人，則未免使人有無聊之感。法國女子呢，她們的容貌，她們的裝束，她們的舉動和談吐，在在都無可疵議，不過照我的直覺，在和我接觸得最多的德，法，日三種女子中，以德國女子最合我的理想：她們有强壯的身體，有眞摰而熱烈的感情，有勤儉耐勞的精神，有爲社會服務的覺悟。假如有人要我在德，法，日三種女子裏面選取一種時，我會毫不遲疑地選取德國女子。不過我旣是中國人，我理想中的愛人當然還得以中國女子做對象。</p>
<p>因爲在國内的時間很少，我和本國女子接觸的機會也就很少，她們的品質究竟如何，我却不甚了然。從表面上看去，中國女子近來似乎略有進步，但是她們那種裝飾大都俗不堪耐，她們那種表情大都使人肉麻。同時許多摩登女子似乎都把工作看做一種恥辱，大家祇知道消費，义麻雀，看電影，跳舞···等等，至於什麽呌做社會國家以及人生的價値和意義，她們根本就不知道，也不願意知道。實在說來。這種女子是一無足取的。不過偌大的中國，我决不相信找不到一個理想的女子。我現在試定一個標準如下：一，有健全的身體。二，有温柔的性格。三，有勤儉的習慣。四，不慕虚榮。五，不打麻雀。六，不參加「政黨」的政治活動。七，有與我共鳴之點。我這標準實在一點也不苛刻，可是我回國至今却還沒有遇到一個這樣的女子！</p>
<h3 id="c281">雲南的玀（三） <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 王俞</p>
<p>他們集合起來，排成零亂的隊伍打鑼的打鑼，敲鏝的敲鏝，男的和女的混合在一塊，談笑着，喜氣盈盈的沿着鄉間的小道像一條長蛇似的往河邊移去。到了河邊，大家便赤着足走到水裡面，把每個人的碗都盛滿了清潔的細沙，然後把各個人手裡的花插在這碗沙的上面。回到缅寺中。大家把採來的沙在院中推積起來，堆成一隻小小的山，又把每個人的花都插一部分在這沙堆上，會跳舞的人們便圍着沙堆跳舞，不會跳舞的就在旁邊觀望着，樂聲震天價的響，一直玩到黃昏，方才散去。</p>
<p>以後天天如是，那院裡的沙堆越積越高。</p>
<p>到大採的時候更熱閙了，這一天，數村的人們都集在一塊，每個人手裡還是一樣的有一碗沙和一束花，他們從這一村遊行到那一村，從這個缅寺到那個缅寺，鑼鼓的聲音響得更厲害，有些人還戴着奇形怪狀的面具沿途跳舞。　　這一天，每個村落裡都預備着許多糯米飯，這是預備給人家吃的，如果我們跑去參觀，我們也可分到一團。</p>
<p>他們的糯米飯都用一種植物的花染成了金黃的顏色，吃起來，有一種可口的香味。</p>
<p>夜間，缅寺裡要放很多的火花。他們的火花是把一些火藥和鐵屑等等寨在一個人竹筒裡製成的。放起來，火花可以飛得八丈高，恰似一株擎天的火樹，火花放完，這一場有趣的娱樂也就完結了。</p>
<p>（六）土司官</p>
<p>玀　的統治者，漢人們呌他做土司官。可是在那些直接被統治於漢人的玀　羣中，已經沒有土司官的存在了。</p>
<p>土司官就好像古代的酋長一樣，他擁有若干土地，他可以把土地的一部分封給他的兒子或親族。在他的領域中，他有支配一切的權力，他可以不費一文錢的代價而從老百姓手中取得他所要求的東西丨無論是一匹善走的馬，或是一個漂亮的姑娘。</p>
<p>玀　百姓對於他們的土司只有絶對的服從。和土司見面時，他們必須叩頭。而且，當土司沒有呌他立起來或是蹲起來的時候，他必須一直跪在地上。</p>
<p>然而土司官也要向大佛爺叩頭的，當他看見大佛爺的時候。</p>
<p>（七）他們的婚姻</p>
<p>關於他們的婚姻，我知道得不很詳細，這是我覺得十分慚愧而且很對不起讀者的。不過我可以千訴諸君：男女的關係，在玀　之間是很自由的。許多做祖母的和做母親的常常對他那腼腆的見孫說：「去和小姑娘玩玩去」。可以說。貞操觀念在他們的腦經中是很淡薄的丨也許完全沒有。不過那些與漢人雜居的玀　，已從漢人的社會裡染上一些虚僞的顏色了。</p>
<p>新娘出嫁多在黎明時候，不坐花轎，而是由人羣中的兩個女人牽着跑，但新娘不可自己走過橋，過橋的時候一定要人家揹她。</p>
<p>新婚之夜有一種「打歌」的娱樂，這與們漢人社會中流行得很普遍的「閙新房」是一樣的性質吧。</p>
<p>第一夜在院子裡排着幾張方桌，桌上擺着一個大酒瓶，許多喝酒的碗或杯。桌上並還點着幾柱香。男的，女的，大家圍在桌旁，一面吃酒，一面唱歌，一面繞着這幾張方桌跳舞，進三步，退三步，有時跳一個圈，有時大家携起手來跳，這樣「打歌」便開始了，要一直玩到手夜或者竟至通宵。</p>
<p>（八）他們的前途</p>
<p>事實告訴我們，有些玀　已在軍營中做着軍官（有做團長的），有些玀　在師範學　畢了業而當着小學敎員，有許多玀　的子弟只能說普通話而不能說玀　話。許多玀　的禮俗都已被廢棄，同時許多漢人的禮俗已被他們採納用。總之，他們處處都在模仿着漢人。當你說他們是玀　的時候，他會以爲你有意侮辱他，他會和你們毆起來的。從這些地方看來，我們已可證明這些玀　漸漸被同化了。同時這兒也指示出我們的任務丨敎育他們並且領導他們的任務！</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「學校裏的功課太忙，以後恐怕不容易有寫文章的機會，先把舊稿整理一下吧。」</p>
<p>他剛把書名解開，把物理·化學，大代數等敎科書和三四本筆記取了出來，整理好了後，便從抽屜裏把舊日所寫的雜感取了出來。</p>
<p>聽見房門外有脚步音。他當是鶴子夫人上來和他談話了。因爲他和好有了這個習慣了，一晚上不見見面談談世間的閒話，便異常的寂寞，像有一個心願沒有了般的。</p>
<p>但是進來的娘姨，提着一壺開水走上來。</p>
<p>「換茶葉麽？」</p>
<p>娘姨的沒有半點美感的聲音。</p>
<p>「不要」。</p>
<p>因爲上來的不是鶴子夫人，他有點失望了，所以隨便的回答了娘姨一聲。他心裏覺得鶴子夫人太可惡了，許久都不上來看看自己。同時他遷怒到那個日本男人來了。</p>
<p>「若不是有兩個女客在下頭·我眞是要拿那根野球棒去打那個老東洋鬼了。」</p>
<p>他愈想愈冒火。他想·要鶴子夫人快點上來向自己解釋一番。氣才得平。便是·向日本人用武只是一個理想吧了。日本人一兇起來，中國人一點也不敢抵抗的。</p>
<p>「萬一動了武·引起了外交問題·不得了。算了吧。」</p>
<p>海泉又怯懦了。他雖然翻了他的舊稿，不單無心思整理，連念也不願念一番了。他眞是氣不過鶴子夫人，一有了日本朋友，便冷落了他。</p>
<p>他坐在書桌前·痴想了有兩個多鐘頭，愈想愈不耐頪。他到後來。便走到扶梯口，倒着耳朶向下面傾聽了一下。那些日本客還是沒有走，又是一陣十分歡樂的鬨笑。</p>
<p>「這眞豈有此理！」</p>
<p>海泉想，這豈不是故意嘲笑自己孤獨的笑聲麽？</p>
<p>他走回書桌前來了，心裏有說不出的一種難過，他自己也莫明其妙，何以今晚上竟會嘔氣到這個樣子。</p>
<p>「明天有解析幾何的習題，今晚上無論如何，沒有心緖去算了。明天給先生呌了上去時，只說傷了風，沒有預備算了。」</p>
<p>於是他又想到今日早上看見的卓淑華，由卓淑華又聯想到任碩士夫人，再由任夫人又想到在南方的佩珠小姐了。</p>
<p>又聽見有人從下面上來的音響。　趟的的確確是鶴子夫人了。海泉心裏有點氣，不能像平時一樣走出房門口來招呼她。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日某君由瀋來滬，據云，日人强佔東北以後，除政治經濟竭力侵略外，文化侵略政策，尤爲可驚，在各學校規定以四書爲必修課目云云。孔二先生，孟老夫子，眞是我國兩尊怪物，他們生時，周洲列國，說仁說義，沒有人去相信，一到死後，忽然「其道大行」非但我國的野心家，掛了他們的金字招牌去賣假藥，被他們麻醉了多少英雄，埋沒了幾許好漢，現在竟有日人所組織的傀儡國，也把他們的金字招牌掛起來了，孔孟兩先生不是做了傀儡的傀儡麽？我不禁替兩先生呌屈。</p>
<p>孔子之道以尊周「攘狄」爲宗旨，孟子之說以崇仁義「斥武力」爲宗旨，現在他們硬要拉孔孟兩先生做東北青年的敎師，眞是「對了和尙駡賊秃」可算是「對症下藥」漢朝王莽，陰蓄異志，開口堯舜，閉口周孔，動必則古稱先王，决後奸謀盡露，從前種種多是虚僞，結果金字招牌被人打掉，欺騙手段到底不行。</p>
<p>日人乎！傀儡乎！此種愚民政策，早已過去，早已不適用於現代潮流。我國已將四書五經，束置高閣，眞正少數的少數學校，尙有拿四書爲敎本，以作研究的資料，現在日本反要拿此法寳，牢絡，麻醉三省的青年，眞是夢影的夢景，我恐三省的青年，不見得被你們所利用罷，孔孟兩先生也不見得替你們效忠罷，可知日人尙是「唐化」的腦筋，此種伎倆煞是可笑。</p>
<p>日人眞欲知道孔孟的學說麽？我就拿孟子的幾句話指點你們聽。</p>
<p>一孟子曰，然則王之所大欲可知矣，欲闢土寺　，朝秦楚，蒞中國，而撫四夷也，以若所爲，求若所欲，猶緣木而求魚也，緣木求魚，雖不得魚，無後災，以若所爲，求若所欲，盡心力而爲之，後必有災。」</p>
<p>又曰「殺越人于貨，閔不畏死，凡民罔不譈。是不待敎而誅者也。」</p>
<h3 id="c284">科學植物香油 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 秋心</p>
<p>植物中含有香油者甚多。此類香油，常含於植物之一部，如花，葉子，根等多用以製造化妝品，因人造香料之香氣，終不及天然香料之幽雅鮮馥。我國用量頗多，惜國產者，祇薄荷油一種。</p>
<p>採取香油，先得知其含油部分：</p>
<p>㈠花香油含於花瓣中者甚多。如玫瑰花，茉莉花，金銀花，橘花，紫丁香花，玉蘭花，拉芬大花，紫羅蘭花等。</p>
<p>㈡葉葉之含香油者，有薄荷葉，桉樹葉，香馥草葉，冬綠樹葉，月桂樹葉，樺木樹葉等。</p>
<p>㈢木及皮檀香木，樟腦樹木，香柏樹木等；含油於皮中如肉桂皮。</p>
<p>㈣根及地下莖白芷樹根，樟木根，珠栗樹根，含於地下莖者有苜藤，鳶尾草等。</p>
<p>㈤菓成熟之菓含香油者，如檸檬，香檸檬，橙等。</p>
<p>㈥子丁香，茴香，苦杏仁等。</p>
<p>香油採取法，因情形之不同，有下列幾種，</p>
<p>（一）壓榨法此法多用於菓類。以成熟之菓皮，置壓榨器中榨取之，所得之油用紗布或棉花過濾即得。此法祗能用於含油多量之植物，因不能盡量榨出。</p>
<p>（二）浸漬法以植物含油部分切成片段，置於油或脂粉中浸漬。香油遂爲浸出，至相當濃度，用火酒溶出，再將火酒蒸發，即得濃厚之香油。</p>
<p>或用揮發性溶劑，（如　方，以脫，四氯化炭等）使之經過層層花瓣（或其他植物之一分）則香油盡爲溶劑溶出，再用蒸發以除溶劑即得。但常含有樹脂，色素及蠟落於揮發性溶劑之物。</p>
<p>（三）蒸餾法以含油之植物或其一部，置水中蒸餾之：香油隨蒸氣出。因水油不能溶和，所得乳狀液體，用分液器除去水分，即得。用此法取得之油常有焦臭，因植物體易黏於鍋底，爲火燒焦之故。</p>
<p>（四）蒸氣蒸餾法此法之原理與蒸餾法同，唯捨火燄直接燒熟，代以蒸氣。即自一汽鍋中發出之蒸氣，經過一盛植物體之蒸餾器。用此法取得之油，常與植物原有之香氣不同。因香油中有沸點高之物，不能隨蒸氣而出：亦有受熱分解者：因之常不能得香味與原植物同之油。</p>
<p>良好之香油，無色。有揮發性。各有特殊之香氣。易流動。此重在○·八四及○·八七之間。（肉桂及丁香油較水重）</p>
<p>香油多受日光，能漸漸變成黃色或棕色。多接觸空氣，受氯化，變成黏性難流動之物。所有香油皆有防腐之能。亦有供藥用者，如薄荷油，肉桂油等。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>現在最流行的口號在除了「抗日救國」以外，不是高唱着「到農村去」嗎？但是·試探究　的效果·恐怕亦引不了多少的青年，脚踏實地的幹去·固然，其中原因，一方面是繁華的都市，迷醉了整個青年的心，使他們不肯探入枯寂的農村；不過我想，社會不給一條有具體方法的路，使青年有所遵循着的走去，亦未嘗不是一個主要緣故吧·譬如像我，就是一大半爲了這個原因，和經濟的壓迫，學識的缺乏，使我平素懷着了的：「到農村去」尤其是幹「農村合作事業」</p>
<p>的志願，到如今總成理想，而仍做一個公司裏的店員，所以先生！我要請求你，解答下面的兩個問題：</p>
<p>㈠社會上有無免費的養成農村合作人才的處所？並請介紹牠的内容·</p>
<p>㈡假使沒有，應該用什麽過度方法，來達到目的？</p>
<p>再再會！祝你健康！（過定安）</p>
<p>編者按：自從產業革命以後，無論是英國或是美國，大批的農民，都不得不捨棄原有的田園向都市裏面跑，這一班人，可以說，是被機器從鄉間抓到城裏去的。於是都市上癰癰式的發達和農村間貧血般的荒發，乃與時俱進。丨這是一幕悲劇，在歐洲老早就演着；現在呢？更苦了　無非是大批失業的工人欲歸農村而不可得。</p>
<p>不幸得很，一切都感覺落後的中國，遲了幾十年，才搬演人家的老把戲，實在是一件悽慘而悲酸的現象，國際資本帝國主義老早形成聯合陣線，除施行惡毒的經濟侵略外，還利用時機，攪得你國内的車閥發生不斷的混戰，一般農民想到都市來做機器的奴隸而不可得，祇有變爲砲灰或餓殍了丨</p>
<p>號稱爲東方巴黎的上海，是個可詛咒的市塲，牠是帝國主義侵略中國的大本營，牠的發達是全國人民的血和淚灌漑成功的。一切　築，一切設備，竭力歐化，誰人到這紙醉金迷的境地不爲牠所誘惑呢？誰人尙有毅力實行到「枯寂的農村」去呢？「高唱着到農村去」的人，也不過將口號當做招牌，自己不是仍然要坐着汽車在柏油的馬路上兜圈子嗎？上海·恐怕已經變成多數人絶對不能離開的搖籃了。丨雖然「到農村去」，「救濟農村」，「改造農村」···在目前是大家所公認的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>過君定安是一個公司裏面的職員，居然想實現「到農村去」這句口號，不能不算是逈異俗流見角卓犖的青年了。關於所提出的兩個問題：第一個，養成農村合作人材的學校；現在據編者所知。尙且沒有。第二個問題，我們有下列的意見，提出供給過君參考。</p>
<p>㈠請先閱覽關於講農村合作方面的書籍；</p>
<p>㈡去就敎對於農村合作有研究的人；（如新華銀行經理王志莘先生等）</p>
<p>㈢到中華職業敎育社所辦的模範村（在徐公橋）作實地的觀察。</p>
<p>編者自覺學識淺陋，見聞有限，所以將這個問題也提出來請大家發表意見。合以前的三個問題。一道都寫在下面：</p>
<p>㈠站在一個店員，工友與學徒的地位，如何可盡中華民國一份子的義務幹抗日救國的工作？</p>
<p>㈡店員，學徒或練習生等，如何可以滿足求知的慾望？</p>
<p>㈢站在店員的地位，應該用什麽辦法從事聯絡，台謀生活的改進？</p>
<p>㈣站在店員的地位，應該由什麽方法實現『到農村去』這句口號？</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>但是當我洗過了臉，精神稍覺淸朗之後，我又决意一定要走了。這是爲什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>你可記得嗎？美麗的小猪玀！去年的春天裏，我不是曾經失踪過一個多月嗎？後來到冬天裏，不是也曾和你揆隔過四五十天的工夫嗎？現在老實告訴了吧！這兩次都是我準備忍痛和你割絶，而沒有達到目的底犧牲的失敗。所謂上南京司法院去，上杭州敎育廳去，實在完全是謊話罷了！</p>
<p>第一次在春天裏，我漸漸發現大經失却了你的愛之後的痛苦了。他本來是一個已經失了戀的不幸者了，而且已爲着那一次的失戀，以致於衰頽得像一個六十歲以上的老人一樣；平均在每十天之内，不容易見到有一次的笑容；他過着這種墳墓式的生活，足足有四年之多。直到前年年底，你們底小薔薇出世，他才像枯木逢春地，漸漸恢復他的青春底活潑了。</p>
<p>我是他的老朋友，老同學，對於他的靈魂的復活，當然是很愉快而極歡慰的；不幸在同時，我却又愛上了你·本來，愛是祇能給於一個人的：我愛了你，便忘記了家庭裏的一切人物：你旣接受了我的愛，對於大經，自然也不免有了幾分變態。這種變態，可以瞞得過一個普通的人，却瞞不過思想和我一般深刻的周太經。於是他又懨懨地絶無生氣了。</p>
<p>有一天，他病了，他害的是腸胃病；但是他不喝藥，儘把許多油膩的東西，夾着冷開水大吃大喝。這一個影字，眞比尖刀還鋒利，立刻在我的心窠上搠了一個大窟洞。第二次，我便决意捨棄你了。</p>
<p>身子雖然不到你們的家裏來，心上却總究忘不掉你。甚至於第隔一分鐘，便會想起你來。</p>
<p>「這樣總是不妙！」我自己也覺得如果讓我這樣時時刻刻的想着你，總有天天，我會重復回到你跟前來的：於是我便竭力的籌劃着，要把你那象牙蛇似的一條倩影，驅逐出我的腦壳外去。籌劃了好久，才被我找出了一條出路。那是什麽？便是「嫖」丨</p>
<p>嫖之於我，以前也是一椿家常便飯。我在囗大附中裏念書的時候，已經是小花園，會樂里一帶的老客人了。說痛快一些·我那時候的寄宿舍·舍便設在會樂里，小花園。</p>
<p>可愛的小朋友！小兄弟！你以前不是時常逼着我，要我講嫖的情形嗎？不過，在那時候，因爲你顯然不是爲了贊成我嫖，而和我作嫖的討論的：你是在諷剌我。所以我也不願意實說，免得累你生氣。但是，現在呢，我已經給津浦車載到了離你數千里之外去了：而且事實上，已不許我在生前再見到你了；儘管讓你恨我，輕視我，我也不能希望受到什麽影響了！那末，我保必自隠其罪惡呢！好！就讓我講一些嫖的情形給你聽聽吧！</p>
<p>雖我同樣是女人，但是你們是高貴而幸福的女人，那裏會想到那些坐　絲包車，穿新裝的娼妓們的痛苦啊！他們的安身所在，在上海名曰堂子；依你們想來，堂子必然是安樂窝，快樂場。其實都是十十足足的脂粉地獄！她們在地獄裏竭力的裝飾，扎扮恭候着一般無處洩慾，無處出氣的男人來出氣。</p>
<p>以前的我，是屬於第一二類：去年春天的我，却屬於第二類了！</p>
<p>不過，嫖在上海，却有一層困難，便是不能無同這；當初我嫖得瘋狂的時候，這種同道，少說些也有十三四個人。大家比親兄弟還親熱，每天混在一起，要標簡直隨時隨地可以嫖；後來忽然散了場，一霎眼倒又過了三年。這時再要嫖，却就沒有搭擋了！好容易給我鑽天打洞的找到了幾位花天酒地的朋友，自告奮勇的請求入夥，</p>

<p>— 梅郎</p>
<p>···共獲盈利二百四十餘萬···</p>
<p>淞滬抗日一役，中西各電影公司爭先掮着「開末拉」，到戰地上去，攝成戰事的影片，種類甚多。在戰爭最先發動的時候。美國「派拉蒙」「福克司」兩家公司的駐滬攝影員，大家把攝得的戰地新聞片，即速運寄。惟恐稍落人後，因此雙方競爭。非常劇烈。</p>
<p>當時。兩家公司的影片是同時交由「麥荆來總統號」輪船從上海運出的。雙方在辦妥寄片手續以後，各自發出電報，通知本公司述明經過事實，應得趕速設法迎提。</p>
<p>「派拉蒙」旣接此訊。便向海軍當局，商得同意，在就近艦隊中。借得水上飛機，飛達「火奴魯魯」停泊海面守候．等到「麥荆萊」鼓浪馳來，隨即附輪攀援而上，提取影片駕機載運，凌雲翱翔，直向紐約飛去。</p>
<p>「派拉蒙」爲顧慮周詳計。從「火奴魯魯」到「紐約」，數千里的行程間，又派了兩駕飛機，預先停候在兩距離相當的地點。隨時交替飛運。經過這樣周密的佈置。果然首先運到。開映之日，轟動一時，營業甚盛。「福克司」雖也運用他種速運方法，竭力爭勝。但是已經遲到九小時。</p>
<p>最近派拉蒙公司中人表示，「關於這部滬戰影片營業賬目的結算。其獲盈利二百四十餘萬」</p>
<p>白蒂勞馥特ＢｅｔｔｙＬａｗｆｏｒｄ他和好萊塢别的女明星一樣，常常用頭髮遮着一雙眼睛。好說攝影場上的銀光燈太强了，所以只好用頭髮來保護一點。當然兩眼全遮住更好，但是事實不容好那麽辦。好是無台名伶ＥｒｎｅｓｔＬａｗｆｏｒｄ的掌珠。自演了ＴｈｅＭｏｎｋｅｙｓＰａｗ一片後，好就成了明星中之之明星了。</p>

<p>— 森</p>
<p>九一八國難發生後，國人都很氣憤，金𦦨更氣憤，因爲他原是朝鮮人，所以對於桑梓興亡更關切！他比任何國人更心急，恨不立時就把日本人佔去的東北收回來，雖然他那時在東北並沒有家。</p>
<p>那時上海的新興劇團，正是風起雲湧，有廣義的以反帝爲目標的劇團，有狹義的以愛國爲目標的劇團，大别起來說，只有這兩種，東北旅滬同鄉抗日會那時阳預備組織劇轉，邀請金𦦨參加，他那時是慨然應允，並且說··「這是我個人的義務，當然義不容辭」劇本選定「飲馬河畔」，以金𦦨爲主角。預備在海上公演</p>
<p>那次雖然劇沒有演成，但因此知道金𦦨對於國難是怎樣的憤慨了。</p>

<p>— 森</p>
<p>前幾天偶然翻出一張舊報紙，看到裏面載了一段關於中國影后阮玲玉的記事。裡面大意說阮玲玉的風騷，熱烈，美麗，確不减於克萊拉寳，不過，美中不足的是她臉上近來有了些淺淺的麻子，在鏡頭上抽影時還沒有妨礙，但實際上是隠藏不住的，是一件憾事。丨大概的意思是這樣，因爲那張報紙已經又不在手下了</p>
<p>關於阮玲玉，從前見過，近來也見過，好像好的臉上並沒有怎樣的麻點。那麽，是怎回事呢？</p>
<p>如果阮玲玉的臉上，有點微細的斑點，這是難免的。可是。斑點在年青時，靠裝飾手法，可以完全遮飾過的。但是現在的阮玲玉，旣沒有怎樣年老，又不缺乏修飾，她臉上的斑點，恐怕還不容易爲外人見到呢。至於說阮玲玉臉上有麻點，這件事，我是有些不以爲然的，因爲麻同斑是絶然不同的兩件東西。</p>

<p>昨天本刋上有湯神君的一段「咱們的小生，」的確在影片田園中的小生，和舊劇中的老生，一樣的感覺需要。就是片廠老　以及影刊的編者，也都注意在女角身上，把小生忽略了。</p>
<p>可惜湯神君沒有記載完全，所以我不避畫蛇添足之譏，就我所知的添寫幾個在下面。汪福慶：他是中國小生中最早的第一人。他加入過許多公司，成績很好後來自己辦大東公司，最近導演了一齣「春風楊柳，」不久也許會公映。不過提到他，雖然影界中人·都奉爲先進，因爲他久不登銀幕，所以衆却已忘了他了。</p>
<p>張慧冲：因爲他最近自己攝了一部「十九軍戰史」所以又有不少人想起他來。他的全盛時期是民國十年左右，那時他和他妻子徐娥合作的「好兄弟」等片，都一時膾炙人口。他不只是作演員，也常常同時作導演，攝影師燈光員，佈影員等：可以算一個多才多藝的人。</p>

<p>初到異鄉的嘉寳和黛德絲，都感着人地生疏·旅居寂寞，只有朝夕伴着她們的導演，以期得其保護。也許是因爲她們和各人的導演往來太親密了，或許是覺得這兩位大導演裁培好們用盡了苦心，而圖報其知遇之恩　所以我們的這一對神秘女郎。相傳和各人的導演，也有一回同樣的神密的故事。影界聞珍</p>

<h3 id="e3">Foreign Minister Luo Issues Declaration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>China is willing to maintain friendship and peace with neighboring countries; any effort sufficient to promote cooperation should be encouraged; employing aggressive means only invites serious consequences.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations have been formally restored as of today. Foreign Minister Luo issued the following declaration on the 13th:</p>
<p>China is willing to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries. The Sino-Russian border is one of the longest in the world. The formal restoration of consular relations is a deeply satisfying matter. Soviet Russia is currently engaged in construction, proving that it seeks the happiness of its people through a great economic plan, rather than aggressive means. Modern China's current endeavors share the same vision. The urgent task of Chinese politicians is to plan great material and economic construction, the benefits of which will hopefully be enjoyed by the whole world. However, China's implementation of this plan is facing various difficulties and obstacles due to the sudden invasion and occupation of a large, fertile portion of its land. For foreign military force to disrupt China's work, which is aimed at peace, is a serious threat that may have major consequences. Therefore, any effort sufficient to promote mutual trust and international cooperation is valuable and should be encouraged. The new relationship is the result of the mutual desire of China and Russia to create a new era of peace and prosperity in the Far East. The restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations only has special significance under this kind of observation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Process of Sino-Soviet Resumption of Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Yan and Litvinov's negotiations have long been successful; mutual dispatch of ambassadors to be implemented soon; U.S. recognition of Soviet Russia not far off.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Five years after severing diplomatic relations with Russia, Yan Huiqing and Litvinov exchanged documents in Geneva on the 12th, declaring the restoration of diplomatic relations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Severance of Diplomatic Relations): In April 1927, Zhang Zuolin protested the Russian embassy incident in Beijing by recalling the Russian chargé d'affaires. In December of the same year, after the Canton Communist Incident, the National Government revoked recognition of the Russian embassy in China. At this point, all Russian diplomatic personnel in China were recalled. In the spring of 1929, the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway arose. In May, Russia suspended the treatment of Chinese diplomatic personnel, and the National Government recalled its envoys, completely severing diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>(Restoration of Diplomatic Relations): In 1930, China sent Mo Dehui and others to Russia to open the Sino-Russian Conference to discuss issues such as the Sino-Russian trade agreement and the restoration of diplomatic relations, but no results were achieved. The Central Government also had inconsistent opinions on the restoration of diplomatic relations. On June 6 of this year, the Central Political Council resolved to restore diplomatic relations and negotiate a non-aggression treaty. The plan was to proceed in secret, but unfortunately it was leaked, resulting in vigorous sabotage by Japan. The former Japanese ambassador to Russia, Hirota, even suggested signing a non-aggression treaty with Russia. Matsuoka, when passing through Russia on his way to Europe, also negotiated with Karakhan, but there was no sincerity and conflicts of interest prevented success. Our side still proceeded in secret. Foreign Minister Luo instructed Yan Huiqing and gave him opportunities to negotiate with Litvinov in Geneva in secret, as both attended the Disarmament Conference, making close contact more convenient. It was impossible to proceed in Moscow. The Yan-Litvinov negotiations repeatedly stalled and resumed, but eventually moved closer. Due to the international situation, we resolutely agreed to restore diplomatic relations first, and the opinions of both sides were in complete agreement. Two weeks ago, our reporter met Foreign Minister Luo, who smiled and told the reporter, "Matsuoka's activities have completely failed at our hands," and said that there would be a demonstration of the facts in ten days. The Yan-Litvinov negotiations had already been successful. Litvinov had returned to Russia for instructions. Recently, when Su Bingwen retreated to Russia, Japan demanded extradition, but Karakhan sternly refused. This was due to Russia's strict adherence to neutrality, but also because it had already understood our situation and was showing goodwill. Our reporter at that time asked Foreign Minister Luo about Su's safety, and Luo said that Su would definitely return home safely. When asked about the timing of the restoration of diplomatic relations, Luo replied, "Within a day or two." Litvinov had already traveled from Russia to Europe. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, Litvinov and Yan had a ten-minute meeting and exchanged documents on the restoration of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>(Mutual Dispatch of Ambassadors): The first step after the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations is to mutually dispatch ambassadors and consuls, and then negotiate a non-aggression treaty, a trade treaty, and resolve outstanding issues. It is rumored that the candidate for our ambassador to Russia has already been internally decided, but it will be kept secret until the announcement.</p>
<p>(U.S. Recognition of Soviet Russia): While Japan was active with Russia, the U.S. and Russia were also active and close, and there has been considerable understanding. After Roosevelt takes office in March next year, the first step will be to formally recognize Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>(International Situation): Experts observing this League of Nations General Assembly believe that because Britain favored Japan, the proposal of small countries to sanction violent Japan was opposed, and the prestige of the League of Nations in maintaining justice and peace was swept away. The situation should change after the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations. After the U.S. recognizes Russia, the anti-Japanese atmosphere will become even stronger.

<h3 id="e5">Sino-Russian Representatives Issue Statements on Resumption of Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations agreed upon as early as November 20; we have taken the lead in the cause of peace.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Our chief representative, Yan Huiqing, told Central News Agency reporters today that the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations negotiations began in April this year. It was originally intended to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but the two countries have now agreed to restore diplomatic relations first. On November 20, the day after Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived in Geneva, the matter was completely agreed upon. Mr. Yan expressed joy in personally accomplishing this great achievement, which is necessary for mutual assistance between the two great countries, and said that the fact that Litvinov and himself were both attending the Disarmament Conference in Geneva was an excellent opportunity to accomplish this. Although the Disarmament Conference has not yet achieved good results, we have already taken the lead in the cause of peace. Mr. Yan solemnly declared that China has very deep sincerity in restoring friendly relations with Soviet Russia. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The agreement on the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations is the result of negotiations that began this spring when Litvinov attended the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. China originally proposed a non-aggression treaty, but Soviet Russia refused, because it did not want to use this as a condition for restoring diplomatic relations. China then abandoned its original proposal for a non-aggression treaty. After months of negotiation, the resumption of diplomatic relations took shape. It is reported that the resumption of diplomatic relations does not eliminate the possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty in the future. When the two countries are willing, they can still conclude this treaty or other forms of agreement. Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiqing today issued the following statement on the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations: "I am very pleased to represent China in restoring diplomatic relations with Russia. When I came to Geneva as the Chinese representative to attend the Disarmament Conference, I had a feeling that the two great countries on the Pacific coast should restore normal relations for the sake of peace. Litvinov also has this feeling. We have long understood that the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries cannot be delayed any longer. Litvinov's arrival here is considered an excellent opportunity to realize this. The fact that the Lytton Report mentioned Soviet Russia and suggested inviting the U.S. and Russia to participate in the 19-member special committee discussion further proves the need for the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations. China is very sincere in its determination to enhance friendly relations with this neighbor, and Russia must also be sympathetic." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov met with newspaper reporters today and issued a statement on the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations. Mr. Litvinov said that this completely normal action does not need to be explained. Only the severance of diplomatic relations or the refusal to maintain diplomatic relations with other countries needs to be explained, because this phenomenon is sufficient to hinder normal international relations and even affect peace. Mr. Litvinov continued that the matter of the Sino-Russian severance of diplomatic relations years ago need not be mentioned now. The situation at that time had nothing to do with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's policy is to maintain normal diplomatic relations with other countries, and it absolutely does not recognize the severance or refusal of diplomatic relations with other countries as an appropriate method for resolving international problems. Countries that have used this method to resolve disputes with the Soviet Union have not found it beneficial, and China must also feel this way. Moreover, the current dispute in the Far East is somewhat related to the failure of countries on the Pacific coast to maintain completely normal diplomatic relations. The Soviet people have always had the greatest sympathy for the Chinese nation's desire to maintain independence, sovereignty, and international equality. The Soviet government's friendship towards China can be well demonstrated by its unilateral abandonment of unequal treaties, extraterritoriality, and all the rights acquired by Tsarist imperialism in China, and its transformation of the Chinese Eastern Railway into a Sino-Russian joint-venture commercial organization. It is precisely because of this friendly feeling that the Soviet Union and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1924, and today's resumption of diplomatic relations is also based on this feeling and is not accidental. Mr. Litvinov concluded that the Soviet Union has no secret treaties or alliances with any other country, so its improvement of relations with one country will not affect its relations with other countries. This policy is the only correct way to consolidate world peace. Only when all countries maintain normal relations can we truly talk about international cooperation for peace, strict adherence to international peace agreements, and the establishment of powerful international organizations. I believe that all those who support peace and international cooperation will be happy to hear the news of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two great countries of China and Russia.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry was already aware that China and Russia were actively proceeding with the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, but could not believe that it could be realized in such a short time. This morning, the Japanese Foreign Ministry suddenly received a formal report from the Japanese delegation in Geneva, causing extreme fluster in Japanese diplomatic circles. It is reported that Foreign Minister Uchida convened a meeting of all division chiefs this morning to discuss how to deal with the new situation. The Sino-Russian non-aggression treaty, the issue of the extradition of Su Bingwen, and countermeasures in the League of Nations were all discussed carefully. (Hualian dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese political circles were not surprised by the news of the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, but they are quite troubled by this new development. According to reports, Japan inquired with Moscow on November 4 whether the news that Dr. Yan Huiqing was discussing the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations with Litvinov was true. At that time, Mr. Litvinov admitted that China had indeed made this proposal, but the two countries had not taken any action on it. At the same time, the Soviet Foreign Ministry also replied that Moscow was prepared to negotiate, but opposed the 1924 treaty governing relations between the two countries during the negotiation period. It is reported that China originally requested the restoration of diplomatic relations under certain conditions. However, because of the possibility of Soviet Russia joining the Sino-Japanese dispute arbitration committee, it withdrew the conditions it had put forward, thus obtaining Soviet Russia's consent. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A government spokesperson declared that Japan welcomes the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations. The elements that most disturb world peace have now joined hands, and Japan is in a good position to confront them. The question that the powers should decide today is whether to allow destructive forces or unity to govern the East. The Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations has clearly raised this issue. If the future of Manchuria is placed alongside this, it feels comparatively meaningless. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Sino-Soviet Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Will Change the International Situation; Some Say it is Beneficial to Japan, Others Say it is Not. Observations from Tokyo <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, the Japanese Foreign Ministry received the news with great excitement, but due to diplomatic etiquette, officials refused to comment. According to internal sources, there are two views on this issue, one is that it is clearly beneficial to Japan, and the other is that it is not beneficial to Japan. Those who argue that it is beneficial believe that because Britain and France favor Japan and the League of Nations does not uphold justice, China devised a plan to use Russia to restrain Britain and France. However, Britain, because of the national awakening in its colonies of Egypt and India, is gradually developing anti-British sentiment and seeking independence. Soviet Russia is also standing on the side of the weak and assisting the anti-British independence movement, so Britain fears Russia and hates Russia. Now that China is close to Russia, Britain will do its best to help Japan oppress China, seeking Japan's help in the Far East to suppress the independence movements in its colonies. France, as the leader of the anti-Russian alliance, hates Russia the most and needs to rely on Japan to deal with the Vietnamese national revolution. In any case, Britain and France will therefore more firmly support Japan. Those who argue that it is not beneficial believe that today, when the attitude of the League of Nations is undecided, the hope of Soviet Russia recognizing the puppet state will be dashed. The righteous armies in various parts of the three northeastern provinces believe that Russia is our friendly country and has received Russian assistance, so they no longer need to fear the Japanese army. Therefore, it is feared that this will increase the anti-Japanese atmosphere and strength of the righteous armies. In this way, they will be surrounded by enemies, and the spiritual blow will be considerable. The colonial peoples worship Russia as a savior, which will have a significant spiritual impact on the colonies. The transfer of Su Bingwen is even more impossible to negotiate. Among the members of the League of Nations, the smaller countries have long been angry at Britain and France for using the League of Nations to oppress smaller countries. If Britain and France further clearly express their support for Japan, then the League of Nations will lose the substantive support of the smaller countries and will lose its spiritual support in the world. Therefore, Britain and France's support for Japan is limited to not destroying the League of Nations. If the League of Nations is in danger, then Britain and France will also have to reconsider and the strength of their support for Japan will be slightly weakened. Because of this environment, it is actually unfavorable to Japan. (Hualian dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations is regarded here as a very important event. All sectors of the League of Nations are surprised by this. It was initially thought that the reason for the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov was to negotiate a non-aggression agreement with Japan. Judging from the most recent developments, the rumors that the Soviet Union had a secret agreement with Japan to help Japan are not credible. Litvinov also personally and emphatically stated to various newspapers that Soviet Russia has never been sullied by any secret alliances or agreements. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the announcement of the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, the League of Nations showed surprise. When the first report came out, no one believed it. When the news was confirmed and it was learned that the documents concerning this matter had been signed and exchanged by Chinese representative Yan Huiqing and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, everyone was greatly surprised. According to observers, the impact of this incident is quite similar to the conclusion of the former German-Russian Rapallo Treaty. In short, the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has a huge impact on the changes in the Far Eastern situation. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) At 5:30 this afternoon, half an hour after the announcement of the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke visited Litvinov. Matsuoka originally wanted to mention the non-aggression treaty and the Manchurian issue again, and wanted to use Russia to restrain the League of Nations. Hearing that China and Russia had resumed diplomatic relations, his treacherous plans could not be implemented, so he changed his attitude, only thanking him for the hospitality he received in Russia, and uttering a few conventional greetings for the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations before leaving in a hurry. The Japanese delegation then held another meeting to revise its strategy towards the League of Nations. (Hualian dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations has given the Japanese two extreme reactions. Japanese who serve in the anti-imperialist movement and liberals have expressed satisfaction, while aggressive militarists and politicians are very angry, saying that Russia wants to exchange Manchurian recognition for a non-aggression treaty, which is intended to be perfunctory and is not sincere. In this way, "Manchukuo" should no longer adopt a pro-Russian policy. Today, with the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, recognition of the puppet state can be said to be hopeless. The military is adopting the original policy toward Russia. After the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, the anti-Japanese forces in Manchuria will increase even more. Japan must take this opportunity to ally with Britain and France to restrain Russia and not adopt a policy of pleasing Russia, which would be a mistake in the country's long-term plan. Those who hold this view are mostly fascists.</p>

<p>Disregarding Justice, Continues to Publish Remarks Unfavorable to Us, Advocating the March 11 Resolution as the Basis for Mediation</p>

<p>(Geneva) The 19-member special committee appointed representatives from Britain, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the Czech Republic this afternoon to form a drafting committee for the Sino-Japanese dispute reconciliation plan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 19-member special committee met for two and a half hours this afternoon and discovered a powerful undercurrent. It decided to appoint a five-member subcommittee to draft a proposal for submission to the League of Nations General Assembly. Initially, some strongly advocated drafting a proposal based on the proposals submitted to the General Assembly by Ireland, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Sweden. The Czech representative, Pennas, the Spanish representative, Surutai, and the Swedish representative, Jia, spoke very passionately, advocating the passage of the Lytton Report and the non-recognition of Manchukuo. However, the British representative, Simon, and the French representative, Marie, both advocated moderation, saying that mediation procedures should be exhausted first before adopting a position that is equivalent to arbitrating the matter. There was a fierce debate at the meeting, focusing on the form of the proposal that should be drafted. Britain has always held a view that the proposal should merely reiterate the March 11 resolution, and advocated inviting the U.S. and Russia to participate. The smaller countries are prepared to reiterate the March resolution, but want to pass the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report, even without including concrete remarks on "Manchukuo." The Irish representative especially strongly advocated this point. At about 6:00 PM in the evening, the tone of the meeting gradually softened. Simon's proposal seemed to be making progress. When Simon explained his proposal and advocated reiterating the March 11 resolution, he said that this resolution included all points and proved the principles of the League of Nations in extremely clear and error-free language. At the end of the meeting, it was decided to form a subcommittee consisting of Czech representative Pennas, Spanish representative Matariga, French representative Marie, British representative Simon, and Swiss representative Huber to draft a proposal for submission to the League of Nations General Assembly as soon as possible. After this proposal is drafted, it still needs to be discussed by the 19-member special committee before it can be submitted to the General Assembly. Observing the organization of the subcommittee, France, Britain, and Switzerland are together, and the Czech Republic and Spain are together, but it is believed that the moderates will have the upper hand, because the Czech Republic has deep relations with France. Therefore, although the situation is tense, the future is not yet dark, and no one wants to easily disrupt this procedure. If the proposal submitted exceeds the March 11 resolution, it will immediately result in Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The meeting of the 19-member committee was completely non-public. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The five-member subcommittee met in the secretary-general's office this afternoon in a tense atmosphere. Only Secretary-General Drummond was present. Judging from various phenomena, this meeting will be a difficult hurdle. The representatives of the major and minor countries have their own views, and so far there seems to be little change. Although conflicts of opinion are inevitable, they should not be seen as lacking a spirit of reconciliation. It is expected that British Foreign Secretary Simon will act as a mediator and try to prevent the dispute from reaching a stalemate between the small and large countries. The proposal drafted by the five-member subcommittee will determine in what situation the U.S. and Russia will be invited to participate, and in what situation the cooperation of China and Japan in the work of the mediation committee will be sought. The smaller countries are now advocating a declaration of principle, partly because they heard that the U.S. must have the League of Nations General Assembly adopt this position before it will agree to participate in its work. However, the U.S. has not made any concrete expression of this nature, and there is no written opinion, so the League of Nations General Assembly may not rashly take any action because of this. It is said that the March 11 resolution, which Simon advocated reaffirming, actually includes this principle. The Disarmament Conference will be adjourned tomorrow, so the 19-member special committee can focus more on its work. It is hoped that the drafting committee will be able to report its recommendations tomorrow, and the League of Nations General Assembly will discuss this proposal on Friday, so that the entire issue can be entrusted to the mediation committee.

<h3 id="e18">Resumption of Sino-Soviet Relations and the Ambiguity of the Current International Situation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Relationship Between China and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The diplomatic relationship between our country and the Soviet Union was completely severed after the Sino-Soviet conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway in July 1929. Although there were consulates stationed due to special local circumstances, these were only temporary measures taken out of expediency and could not be considered normal diplomatic relations. Later, Mr. Mo Dehui went to Moscow, but after repeated delays and negotiations, no results were achieved. The territories of China and the Soviet Union are connected, starting from Puli in Xinjiang in the west and reaching the gate of Jilin in the east, intertwined for over 10,000 li. In the world today, no other countries have such a close territorial connection. Although the areas where China and the Soviet Union border each other are not characterized by towering mountains and majestic rivers, but rather lie in remote and bitterly cold borderlands, which inevitably leads to geographical isolation, today, with the convenience of transportation by land, sea, and air, the barriers of mountains and rivers are as if they were next door. Although the political systems of China and the Soviet Union are different, and the ideologies they espouse are also different, the promotion of international circumstances and the need to safeguard peace in East Asia are sentiments shared by all countries in the world. The movement to resume Sino-Soviet relations was brewing in this atmosphere of peaceful foresight.</p>
<p>(2) The Triangular Relationship Between China, Japan, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>When Japanese news agencies transmitted the news of the resumption of Sino-Soviet relations, this newspaper quickly published it, expressing its sincere hope for maintaining peace and welcoming the resumption of relations. If the unfortunate incident of July 1929 had not occurred between China and the Soviet Union, or if it had occurred and been resolved quickly, and normal diplomatic relations had been restored, then even if the Mukden Incident could not have been avoided, the ferocity of the Japanese warlords might have been slightly curbed. At the very least, the area along the Chinese Eastern Railway would not have been as devastated as it is today, and the territory within North Manchuria could have been preserved. The pursuit of justice and righteousness through the League of Nations would probably not have been entirely exploited by the Japanese, using fabricated cases to create ready-made facts.</p>
<p>In the current situation in Northeast China, economic power in the area of South Manchuria is entirely in the hands of Japan. In recent years, the construction of the Feng-Hai Railway and the Tao-Ang Railway, although not enough to compete with Japanese imperialism, the rise of national capital is an undeniable historical fact. This has aroused extreme jealousy from Japan, but the emerging forces are not yet fully developed and are difficult to contend with a powerful enemy in a short period. As for the Chinese Eastern Railway that runs through Jilin and Heilongjiang, it has been relegated to an ungoverned area by the Soviet Union, which is concentrating on its own development. This has allowed Japan to take advantage of the situation. The September 18th Incident has changed again and again, expanding and spreading to the three northeastern provinces. If it is not addressed, disaster will befall North China.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the League of Nations General Assembly has produced no results other than delay. The remarks of representative Yan Huiqing in Geneva were: "I am very pleased to represent China in restoring diplomatic relations with Russia. I have a feeling that the two major countries on the Pacific coast should restore normal relations for the sake of peace..." At the same time, the documents exchanged between Representative Yan Huiqing and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov stated that "The governments of both countries are eager to promote friendship between the two countries for the sake of peace. Therefore, it has been decided that normal diplomatic and consular relations have been officially restored from today." We dare not say that the restoration of Sino-Soviet relations will solve the Far Eastern problem, and we dare not expect that the restoration of Sino-Soviet relations will bring some unexpected assistance. However, we know for sure that after the restoration of Sino-Soviet relations, there will be more convenience in general commerce, and politically and diplomatically, we will not be taken advantage of due to isolation. For the future of the Northeast, at least the enemy's convenience can be reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Changes in the Situation Between the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>What we in our country should be concerned about regarding the resumption of Sino-Soviet relations, and what the international community should pay the most attention to, is the attitude of various countries towards China. Our country in the Northeast is already caught between two major powers and has nowhere to turn. In the mainland, it is even more surrounded by powerful countries and is more easily controlled. However, the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, and relations between Japan and the United States are gradually worsening. For the sake of implementing its political strategy, the Japanese military clique is sparing no effort to work closely with the Soviet Union through Yosuke Matsuoka, hoping to gain deep understanding in order to counter the United States. At this time, the United International Press has submitted a proposal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to resume US-Soviet relations. It will still take time to realize, and although Japanese commerce may see a temporary decline, after the new President Roosevelt takes office, in order to solve the problem with Japan and for the sake of normal commerce, it will be inevitable to revisit the old issue. The restoration of US-Soviet diplomatic relations is also foreseeable.</p>
<p>(4) The Sudden Turn in Relations Between France and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>For fifteen years after the war, France and the Soviet Union have been preoccupied with "security guarantees." They have been concerned about the safety of Poland, fearing both the invasion of Germany and the spread of "red" ideology, so they have taken strict precautions and thorough safeguards. However, in recent years, this kind of hypothesis has been decreasing day by day. In order to maintain its advantage in Western Europe, France has no choice but to forge a distant alliance with the Soviet Union in order to reduce the assistance to the enemy and give its "security" a deeper guarantee. Furthermore, with the world economic recession, France needs a market, and the Soviet Union is the best and most promising investment market in Europe. Thus, France and the Soviet Union have progressed from normal diplomatic relations to signing a non-aggression treaty. During the tense period of the Northeast problem, the situation in Europe suddenly changed - France and the Soviet Union changed from enemies to friends. How could this be without a reason? The transformation of the world situation may change from sealed off to relatively open.</p>
<p>(5) Efforts Our Country Should Make</p>
<p>Our country is in this period of transition and must not fall behind again. Moreover, with a major enemy at hand, we must not lose the initiative. At this critical moment, our government has been able to overcome all difficulties and establish a unique diplomatic path, based on its own position, and restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. This cannot be said to be not adapting to the times. Although it is inevitable to incur the enemy's jealousy, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not fabricate rumors to confuse international public opinion. However, for the establishment of peace in the Far East and for the struggle for national survival, we must move forward bravely, break the vile behavior of Japanese militarism, and promote human "justice and righteousness" with a spirit of dedication and sacrifice.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee held a closed meeting yesterday. British Foreign Secretary Simon continued to make remarks unfavorable to our country, advocating that the vague resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on January 11 of this year be used as the basis for mediation, and not to use the facts in the Lytton Report that are unfavorable to Japan as the basis.

<p>Japan's Unchanging Stubborn Attitude Makes Mediation Hopeless</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan sent a letter to the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee today, repeatedly requesting that the report be published on a regular basis in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the League of Nations Covenant, and declaring that the Chinese government had stated in the General Assembly on December 6 that it was prepared to accept the mediation method based on China's proposal, but if the Japanese government does not change the attitude expressed by Matsuoka, there is absolutely no hope for the success of the mediation process. Therefore, he hopes that the Special Committee will give due consideration to this key point when deciding on a certain deadline. The subcommittee drafting the proposal is scheduled to meet tomorrow afternoon. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative Yan Huiqing submitted a memorandum a few days ago, firmly requesting the League of Nations to determine a definite date in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant, so as to publish the report on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Nineteen-Nation Committee reviewed this memorandum when it met. The main points of its content are as follows: "My government is prepared to accept the mediation method in accordance with the designated basis. I have already declared this on December 6 at the Extraordinary General Assembly. However, the attitude of the Japanese government, as stated by its representative, is very stubborn. If this attitude is not changed, the hope of success of the mediation method is extremely slim." The Nineteen-Nation Committee has studied this mediation process and found it very difficult, because it cannot involve the content of the dispute and certain principles should be maintained.

<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative submitted two official documents to the League of Nations today, one regarding the Japanese army's shelling of Shanhaiguan on December 8. The Chinese representative stated that Japanese armored trains fired a total of ten shells, bombarding the town, and denied the Japanese claim that Chinese soldiers fired at the Japanese armored trains first.

<p>(Tokyo) Reuters learned from responsible sources today that British Ambassador Sir Lindley had made friendly advice to the Japanese government on behalf of British Foreign Secretary Sir Simon, asking Japan to support the Geneva Mediation Committee, because this move seemed to be the only way to avoid the natural implementation of Article 15, Section 4 of the League of Nations Covenant in dealing with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Article 15, Section 4 "stipulates that if the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Executive Council shall, by a majority vote of all members, issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations made by the Council that are fair and appropriate." Political circles here deny the report that British Foreign Secretary Simon threatened to propose the implementation of Article 4 of the Covenant if Japan refused to accept the Mediation Committee, and asked the Japanese government to express its deep appreciation for Simon's consistently friendly treatment of Japan. The Japanese government disregarded the advice of the British ambassador and telegraphed the Japanese representative in Geneva, ordering him to refuse to participate in the Mediation Committee organized by the League of Nations. This decision by the Japanese government is based on the reservations raised by Japan regarding the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, believing that these reservations must also apply to the committee with the participation of US and Russian representatives. This committee is merely an expanded version of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee. This instruction was issued after the cabinet meeting considered the matter. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since the Japanese armored vehicle opened fire on Qian Suo, all the city gates have also been opened, and the electric nets and other installations set up by both the Chinese and Japanese sides have been removed. However, people's hearts are still uneasy, and rumors are still rife. Pseudo-police are rampant in the station, often carrying guns and patrolling outside the station. When the Bei-Ning Railway train arrives at the station, the pseudo-alert is even more intense. Yesterday morning, the Japanese army conducted a drill along the South China Sea and once invaded the station for an attack practice. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency Washington, December 12th: Former US Envoy to China, Mr. Schurman, delivered a speech on the Philippine issue at the Catholic University here today, stating that Japan did indeed pay attention to southward expansion for a period of time, but since 1921, it has changed. Even during his tenure as envoy to China, he could perceive the actual change in its goals. Now it has definitely turned westward, even intending to expand south of the Great Wall of China to Inner Mongolia and eastern Siberia. Therefore, he believes that Japan will disregard the independence of the Philippines and adhere to its existing expansion plan, so there is no need to worry too much about the Philippines being seized by Japan after independence. The Philippine independence bill currently under review in the Senate, with a period of nearly 20 years, is too long. He believes that it should be granted freedom immediately.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency London, December 13th: Today, the British government replied to the United States, stating that Britain is prepared to pay the US war debt under the circumstances described in the previous note, showing that although the US government's attitude is firm, the British also hold the same determination. Today's British note stated that the British government must retain the right to raise these circumstances when considering the entire issue in the future. Regarding the US note's claim that the US President has no power to agree to change the predetermined payment terms, the British note stated that the British government did not mention any event that could affect the constitutional position of the United States. The previous note should only be regarded as specifically discussing the British government's own position, which was determined after careful consideration.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency Paris, December 12th: The Chamber of Deputies held a meeting to discuss the war debt issue. First, Prime Minister Herriot made a declaration, followed by a reply from Member Maran. Then, the meeting was adjourned to allow Herriot to attend various committees. The Chamber is scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 PM tomorrow. When the Chamber was in session, hundreds of royalists opposed repaying the war debt and planned to demonstrate in front of the Chamber. Fortunately, the police had made arrangements in advance, and the security was very strict. The demonstrators were unable to approach the parliament, and several were arrested. The Chamber adjourned at 6:00 PM and is scheduled to continue the meeting the next day. Most of the police then withdrew.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency Paris, December 12th: The Joint Finance and Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a joint meeting at 7:00 PM, where Prime Minister Herriot and Finance Minister De Marcé discussed the recent negotiations between France and Britain regarding the war debt due on December 15th. Herriot stated that Washington had sent repeated communications, and then described the Anglo-French negotiations. This discussion took a very long time, and the committee was expected to adjourn very late. The meeting will continue at 2:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency Paris, December 12th: At 3:30 PM, the Chamber began to discuss the war debt issue. The venue was packed. Prime Minister Herriot delivered a speech in an objective manner, first expressing respect for the United States' participation in the war. Then, he said that the misunderstanding between Europe and the United States was due to the United States neglecting European issues after the war, and Hoover's method of delaying war debt payments actually reopened the entire issue. France was most affected by the delayed payment because France suffered a loss of 1,650,000 pounds and lost its creditor status. In addition, France also allowed assistance to restore German credit. Although France endured such sacrifices, it did not receive any compensation, which is regrettable. Referring to the Treaty of Lausanne, Herriot said that this treaty more than doubled the credit of the United States and undoubtedly greatly benefited the United States. Herriot then emotionally said that France had fulfilled its obligations to the cause of international cooperation. He then explained how France negotiated with Britain and the United States, saying that Britain could have sought special treatment from the United States, but Britain did not, and its attitude was very honorable. Herriot continued that they are now seeking a solution with the least amount of harm. The methods of arbitration and outright refusal to pay are currently not feasible. For the sake of long-term interests and historical reputation, France cannot but respect the words it signed. The French people do not express opposition to the repayment of war debts. The government is not unaware of this, but in order to respect international promises, it must have a firm position. Moreover, France's counterpart has a US President and a US Senate, both of whom cannot make a final decision on the war debt issue. If France refuses to pay, what impact will it have? This must be considered in advance. As for Britain, it is especially important not to separate it from France.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London, December 12th: Baldwin said in the House of Commons today in response to a request from the leader of the opposition party that the government has decided to dedicate Wednesday to the debate on the war debt issue. The speakers will be Chancellor Chamberlain, former Chancellor Churchill, former Chancellor Horne, Liberal Party leader George, Prime Minister MacDonald, and Labour Party leader Lansbury. Members who are dissatisfied with the attitude of the United States are expected to be very active in the debate. However, the government hopes that the discussion will not be intense. Any criticism of the government is naturally aimed at consolidating the government's rejection of future payments. It is generally said that the payment this Thursday will be the final batch.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London, December 12th: Chancellor Chamberlain said in a speech in Whitehall today that we do not expect the proposal made to the United States to be accepted now, but we retain the right to raise this proposal when the discussion begins. At that time, if this proposal is handled with the friendly spirit that has always existed between the British and American governments, a satisfactory solution can be obtained. We have not demanded that our debtor countries pay their debts currently. He did not mean that the debts owed to the United States could be cancelled, but only that they could be delayed. If the countries that signed the Treaty of Lausanne cannot reach a satisfactory solution with the United States and find it impossible to ratify the Treaty of Lausanne, then we will restore the position before the Hoover moratorium, and we will still seek repayment from our debtor countries. Chamberlain said</p>

<p>▲According to a report from the National News Agency in The Hague on the 13th, the strange person detained in the former German Emperor's residence has yet to reveal his intentions. Today, it was also learned that on December 4th, someone had already slipped into the garden of the former Emperor's residence and hid behind a car. He then entered the reception hall and was discovered. When asked what he was doing, he said he urgently wanted to see the former Emperor, and was thus sent to the police station. It was then realized that he was a harmless madman and released the next day. At the time, he told people that he would definitely come again. The person arrested yesterday has been temporarily detained in the town hall because Doorn is a small town and does not have a prison. The person still refuses to reveal his name.</p>
<p>▲According to a report from the National News Agency in The Hague on the 12th, an assassin was discovered today at the former residence of the deposed German Emperor in Doorn, but the assassination was not carried out. The assassin climbed over the fence and entered the garden of the deposed Emperor's residence, then hid inside the house, concealing himself next to a large wooden cabinet, waiting for the former German Emperor to pass by. The person was carrying a handgun, fully loaded with bullets, and a sharp knife. At that moment, he was spotted by two infantrymen guarding the deposed Emperor, who arrested him. The assassin initially resisted, but was eventually overpowered and handed over to the police. It is said that the two soldiers were able to detect the assassin because there had been a heavy snowfall in the garden, and they followed the footprints in the snow. The assassin is still unwilling to reveal his name, but the police have learned that he came from Germany a few days ago with the intention of assassinating the former German Emperor. Upon hearing this, people cheered.</p>
<p>▲According to a report from Havas News Agency in London on the 12th, Prime Minister MacDonald arrived here at 4 p.m. and stated that the work of the disarmament conference in Geneva is particularly heavy, but the current work has reached the second stage. He is very pleased, he said. The Prime Minister remained silent on the issue of war debts.</p>
<h3 id="e78">After Five Months Absence, Germany Rejoins the Five-Power Disarmament Conference; Stage Concludes <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲According to a report from Reuters in Geneva on the 13th, the German representative attended the meeting of the core group of the Disarmament Conference today after an absence of five months. It is expected that the real work of the military line will begin when the General Committee reconvenes on January 31st next year.</p>
<p>▲According to a report from Reuters in Berlin on the 12th, German left-wing newspapers have criticized the Geneva agreement that allows Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference with equal rights, but the tone is still friendly. However, the newspapers of the National Socialist Party view it coldly. The "Algemeine Zeitung" claims that the only winner is British Prime Minister MacDonald, and Germany has gained nothing in reality. Neurath is only carrying a blank check for the future back to Germany. The "Vossische Zeitung" claims that European peace has been won, and a new starting point for disarmament is about to be achieved. The duty of the German delegation is to continue to remind the Disarmament Conference of what the powers have promised.</p>
<p>▲According to a report from the National News Agency in Berlin on the 12th, German Foreign Minister Neurath returned to the German capital from Geneva today and immediately drove to the Prime Minister's office to report to the new Prime Minister Schleicher on the contents of the mediation approach taken in Geneva and the course of previous negotiations. According to newspaper commentary, although each party has its own views, all recognize this fact as fortunate for the future of the Schleicher cabinet. Because Schleicher has just taken office and already has such a surprising achievement, it may make those who doubt Schleicher more cautious and dare not act rashly, thereby hindering the progress of Schleicher's policies.</p>

<p>▲According to a report from Reuters in Rome on the 12th, when the Fascist Grand Council held its last meeting of the current session today, it passed a resolution advocating for reducing the import of foreign goods, encouraging international tax reductions, and revising Italy's own tax rules in order to obtain mutual treatment from various countries. It also plans to negotiate with countries that supply raw materials to sell Italian products cheaply in their markets.</p>
<p>▲According to a report from the National News Agency in Rome on the 13th, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is still changing important personnel in the Fascist Party. His most recent move is to completely reorganize the executive department of the Fascist Party, retaining only three old members, with the other six being replaced by new members.</p>

<p>▲According to a report from Reuters in London on the 12th, Conservative Member of Parliament Craddock asked the government to instruct the British representative in Shanghai to insist on improving the special district court. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that the British have asked the Chinese government to pay attention to the difficulties in handling the First Special District Court in Shanghai, and have made suggestions to eliminate some of the causes of dissatisfaction. The British government will of course continue to work towards this goal. Conservative Miller asked if the government could consider the British community's petition. Eden replied that we are currently considering the Chinese Association's memorandum and are in close contact with the municipal authorities. Conservative Sandeman asked if it was possible to contact other countries in order to restore the Shanghai Mixed Court.

<p>To the Shanghai News Agency and all sectors of the country: We have recently learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly has decided to abolish the Industry Department and limit the time for officials to leave their posts, and to shut down provincial and county agricultural farms. Furthermore, agricultural improvement donations are being allocated for other uses. The provincial government's organizational authority rests with the central government, and the head of the department is appointed by the National Government. How can the provincial government arbitrarily decide to abolish the department and limit the time for officials to leave their posts? The agricultural improvement donation is collected for improving agriculture, and the provincial government's industry funds are also necessary during the period of political tutelage. Even if the provincial government wants to cut expenses, how can it come up with this idea? If it is said to be considering the burden on farmers, it should even more so move the donation for other uses. Moreover, China is founded on agriculture. Anyone with a little perspective knows that we are now striving for rapid progress, and are still worried about not being able to catch up with others. How can we bear to destroy the considerable foundation that has already been established by the provincial and county farms? In addition to telegraphing the central government to instruct the provincial government not to proceed with the previous decision, we respectfully ask all sectors to jointly uphold justice and prevent the destruction of industry.

<h3 id="e83">The Saito Cabinet, Beset by Difficulties and Disasters <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Saito, who carries the banner of a cabinet uniting the entire country, was entrusted with the mission at a time of great difficulty, as a veteran of the Navy. The Army Ministry is harder than steel, constantly directing its affiliated right-wing groups to use intimidation at best and handguns at worst. The Seiyukai, which advocates constitutional politics, either agrees with the military or loudly sings the praises of constitutional normality. However, they all express extreme dissatisfaction with the current cabinet. Especially after the budget proposal was announced, although taxes were not increased according to the Army's wishes, the burden of 100 million yen in public debt placed on the people has also offended many capitalists. Takahashi Korekiyo, although a veteran of the Seiyukai, cannot suppress such grievances. Although the Minseito Party is willing to be a government party, it has too few seats and not much power. Therefore, at the beginning of the Saito Cabinet's establishment, some people estimated that its lifespan would be no more than three months or half a year.</p>
<p>Now it has been half a year, and it is always stabilizing in the midst of turmoil, achieving a temporary balance in the midst of competing factions. The 64th Diet will officially open on the 24th of this month, and the time is approaching. The attitude of each faction in the House of Representatives is indeed worthy of attention, and the antagonism between the members of each faction has intensified and become apparent from secret activities.</p>
<p>First of all, we see that the Seiyukai, which occupies 298 seats, has three cabinet members in the Saito Cabinet, but it is not satisfied with this. The self-respecting faction is very willing to assist the Saito Cabinet, but it also wants to express its own attitude. On the cabinet side, Takahashi and Mitsuchi have helped with finance and railways. On the diplomatic side, there is Matsuoka Yosuke's great activity in Geneva. Although they often express dissatisfaction with Saito, for the sake of the overall situation, they still believe that they should proceed in the direction of an emergency cabinet. At this time, they want to completely liquidate the relationship between the Saito Cabinet and the Seiyukai. To overthrow the Saito Cabinet is naturally not the time. However, the hardliners are very different. They believe that the Saito Cabinet wears the false mask of an emergency, calls itself a non-partisan, ultra-partyism, but is essentially a rebirth of the bureaucratic cabinet and an extremely ominous event in the history of Japanese constitutional politics. Letting this situation exist for one more day will hinder the development of constitutionalism for one more day, causing party politics to decline day by day. Moreover, the so-called emergency cabinet is to save the emergency period. Now that the budget to save the situation has been established, its mission has mostly been resolved. If it stays in power, it will indeed leave a very bad impression on future generations, leading the current politics to a point of no return. Therefore, it should quickly restore constitutional normality and organize a party cabinet. If the Saito Cabinet is reluctant to leave, the Seiyukai should publicly show its policies and announce its break with the Saito Cabinet based on a free standpoint. However, the fighting general of that faction, Mori Kaku, is currently ill and can hardly attend. Although there are still many people who express dissatisfaction, it is feared that it will be difficult to unify even within the Seiyukai. Therefore, in the parliamentary struggle, the situation within the Seiyukai party is also very worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The Minseito Party only has 122 seats. Even if Saito resigns, the government will not fall into the hands of the Minseito Party. This is something everyone knows. Therefore, the Minseito Party is oppressed by the Seiyukai and feels the fierceness of the military. To establish a political goal for itself, it has no power in fact. Therefore, it still hopes for the reappearance of an emergency cabinet. If an emergency cabinet is organized this time, it is generally observed in political circles that Ugaki Kazushige (the current Governor-General of Korea) will receive the great order. Therefore, the people of the Minseito Party are doing their best to establish a good relationship with Ugaki, preparing to occupy a more dominant position in the future than they do now. If the Seiyukai forms a cabinet, instead of hanging up the banner of a cooperative cabinet and only sending a few irrelevant cabinet members, it is better to let the Seiyukai form a single cabinet and restore constitutional normality, and the Minseito Party can prepare to rise again. Therefore, at this time, the Minseito Party is very willing to be a government party for the Saito Cabinet, and for the future Ugaki, it will adapt to the situation and create an opportunity to take the stage.</p>
<p>The Kokumin Domei, led by Adachi Kenzo, formally formed a party on November 22. It now maintains the position of a purely opposition party and has no special relationship with the current cabinet. Therefore, it maintains a critical attitude towards the budget for the next year, the policy of currency inflation, the disastrous drop in foreign exchange, the extreme anxiety of the people's lives, and the huge defects in finance. Although its claims have no chance of being implemented, its attack on the current government in the Diet will be quite fierce.</p>
<p>The total number of proletarian parties is three members of the Social Democratic Party, one member of the National Socialist Party, and one member who has left the Socialist Party and is still a proletarian. However, with only five seats, it has almost no status in the Diet. Its speech is just a speech, and its influence is very small. However, among the established parties, under the siege of capitalism and militarism, it also has a special value of existence. Although it cannot influence the Diet, it has a little fever-reducing effect on the crazy masses.</p>
<p>The lifespan of the Saito Cabinet and the future of parliamentary politics seem to be expressed in the 64th Diet. However, there are too many internal contradictions in the Seiyukai, and it is not easy to replace Saito. If Saito falls, the chaos may be even worse than it is now. At the very least, the successor must have a relationship with the military to be able to stand firm. (December 7, 1932, in Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Chaotic Situation in Sichuan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>From a correspondent in Hankou: The Sichuan war has been going on for two months now, and the people have suffered greatly from the fighting, and the region has been destroyed. Although the central government has issued clear orders repeatedly, the Sichuan warlords have turned a deaf ear. Recently, Liu Wenhui withdrew from Chengdu, and Liu Xiang is still attacking Renyi. Observing the future, there is indeed a tendency for it to expand and prolong. Based on various circumstances, I record the general situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e85">Course of the Neijiang Conference <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>After Liu Xiang used his entire army and navy to capture Luzhou, Fushun, and Neijiang, the rich resources in the Zigong area became his sole possession. The generals of Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Liu Wenhui's two units were brewing cooperation. Liu Cunhou and Yang Sen were also willing to join, jointly restrain Liu Xiang, and divide the land equally. Therefore, representatives from all parties gathered in Chengdu to discuss so-called ways to end the war. Liu Xiang knew that he was isolated, and secretly won over Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang to maintain the name of the allied army, and convened the Neijiang Conference to oppose the Chengdu Conference. At that time, Deng and Tian were both in Chengdu. Deng had always defended Liu Wenhui, and was deeply dissatisfied because the telegram calling for a ceasefire had not been approved by Liu Xiang. Therefore, he ignored Liu Xiang's call for a conference. Tian had a secret agreement with Liu Xiang before the war, and sent Yu Anmin to Neijiang to assist in preparations. Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou had no preference between the two Lius, and sent representatives to participate in both conferences. Thus, the Neijiang Conference was held, and a resolution was passed to fundamentally eliminate the 24th Army. Liu Xiang's ambition to unify all of Sichuan grew even more as a result. Liu Xiang personally attended the conference, and was able to influence the attendees. The fickleness of the generals also contributed to this.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Liu and Tian Exchange Defenses in Chengdu <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Two months ago, Liu Xiang and Tian Songyao agreed to solve the 24th Army together. The 21st Army was responsible for attacking the front, and the 29th Army was responsible for outflanking the rear. However, Tian Songyao was afraid to act rashly because Liu Wenhui's troops were strong. After Liu Xiang urged him, there was the first street battle in Chengdu. After the 21st Army ordered a general attack, Chengdu became quiet again. Furthermore, due to Deng Xihou's mediation, an understanding was reached with Liu Wenhui. Liu Xiang believed that since the war had already begun, it was impossible to back down. Therefore, he attacked Nei-Luzhou fiercely, and blamed Tian for breaking the agreement. Tian had long been thinking of stationing himself in Chengdu, and his heart was moved. Thus, the second fierce battle in Chengdu occurred. However, Tian's troops suffered great losses in this battle, and were forced to withdraw from Chengdu. Tian was extremely angry, and decided to cooperate with Liu Xiang. Liu Wenhui, facing enemies on both sides, had to ease one side. Therefore, he voluntarily withdrew from Chengdu on the 9th, allowing Tian to take over. Within a month, Liu and Tian alternately became the masters of Chengdu. Judging from the special situation in Sichuan Province, this is not surprising. However, it is said that during the fierce fighting, more than 10,000 people were killed, and property losses were countless, which is lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e87">New Lineup of the Two Liu's Armies <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>With Tian's help, and because the Neijiang Conference decided to fundamentally eliminate the 24th Army, Liu Xiang increased his troops and attacked. He divided them into three routes. The central route was commanded by Wang Zuanxu, and departed from Rong County and Weiyuan, attacking Qingshen, Jingyan, and Renshou. Pan Wenhua and Tang Shizun's two divisions took the left route, along the Min River, attacking Jiading. Luo Zezhou and Li Jiayu's two divisions took the right route, along the Tuo River, attacking Ziyang and Jianyang. On the 9th, after receiving news that Liu Wenhui had abandoned Chengdu, he ordered a full-scale attack. The 24th Army also divided into three routes to meet the enemy. Renshou was the central route, Jiading was the southern route, and Liu Wenhui's main force was responsible for it. Zi-Jian was the northern route, and Deng Xihou's troops were responsible for it. All sides have already made contact, and the outcome has not yet been determined. According to a telegram from Sichuan Province from a certain gentleman from Sichuan, Liu Xiang's side seems to have the upper hand, and Liu Wenhui's troops have been defeated again. However, the strength of the 24th Army is still sufficient, and its base is also wide. It is not easy to fundamentally eliminate it.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Liu Wenhui's New Plan <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui, holding the title of chairman, was by no means willing to give up Chengdu. Because the Yu and Tian armies attacked from both sides, it was difficult to cope with. Therefore, he had to reluctantly give up Chengdu in order to appease Tian's army, so as to concentrate on resisting Yu's army. The troops originally stationed in Chengdu have now withdrawn to Xinjin, 120 miles from the city, and built fortifications to prevent Tian's army from advancing. The central route is stationed in Renshou, the southern route is stationed in Jiading, and it is closely connected with Deng's troops stationed in Zi-Jian to resist desperately. Liu also has a new plan. If Zi-Jian and Renshou cannot be defended, then they will be abandoned together, concentrating on Qingshen, Meishan, and the Ya'an area to shorten the defensive line and preserve strength. Then, taking advantage of Yu's army's exhaustion, he will launch a counterattack again. In case the situation changes again, he will implement the plan to develop the Kang region, and reorganize his troops. The situation in Sichuan is complex. The so-called allied army front will soon merge due to the uneven distribution of spoils. This is also the time for Liu Wenhui to rise again. Therefore, he would rather give up a thousand miles of land to others than to use a single soldier or a single gun to help the enemy, which can also give a glimpse into his intentions.</p>
<p>In summary, the current war is fierce, and there are many hidden dangers in the future. If the situation in Sichuan is not reformed in time and allowed to compete for hegemony, the people of Sichuan after the catastrophe will never have time to recuperate. (December 12)</p>
<h3 id="e89">A Record of Inspecting the Recovered Areas After Suppressing the Communists (1) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The country is in turmoil, and internal and external troubles are coming one after another. The central government believes that it is necessary to settle domestic affairs before resisting foreign aggression, and has specially established the General Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, with the headquarters in Hankou. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, member of the Military Commission, concurrently serves as the commander-in-chief, stationed in Hanyang, overseeing the army, and focusing all efforts on suppressing the communist bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. In the past six months, great achievements have been made. The major communist bandits such as Xu Xiangqian, He Long, and Kong Hechong have been successively defeated, and their nests have been leveled. There are not many remaining bandits, and they are scattered and fleeing. A major campaign is currently underway to completely eliminate them and recover dozens of bandit areas. After the great catastrophe, the fields are desolate for thousands of miles, and the residents are gradually gathering but have nothing to live on. The key to good follow-up work lies in collective wisdom and effort. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, in view of this, invited civic groups from various provinces to organize an inspection group to personally inspect the recovered areas in order to combine the power of the entire country and seek a quick recovery. Groups from Beiping, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places successively organized and gathered in Hankou to set off together. The Beiping City Inspection Group arrived in Hankou on the 30th of last month, and the reporter also joined its ranks. On the evening of the 28th, I left Beiping by train to the south. The situation along the way is as follows: From Ping to Zheng, the road is peaceful, and the residents are bustling and lively, with a sense of peace. South of Xuchang, vigilance is gradually seen. From Jigongshan and Wushengguan to the Guangshui area, the ridges and peaks along the road rise and fall, and the terrain is dangerous. Even in the daytime, the garrison is still scattered on the ridges on both sides, with sentries to guard against unforeseen events. The vigilance at night is even more evident. According to the personnel on the road, although the major communist bandits have been defeated, the remaining bandits are scattered and still being wiped out. The garrison's day and night vigilance, daring not to slack off in the slightest, is to prepare for any eventuality. From Guangshui to Hankou, all the stations passed have anti-communist slogans, which shows that the authorities are focusing all their efforts on this, and will not stop until the goal of complete elimination is achieved. Suppressing the communists is a fundamental national issue. This inspection of the recovered areas is different from ordinary inspections. We must observe from the perspectives of military, politics, economy, society, and people's livelihood in order to be thorough. The reporter is not talented, but I am willing to investigate based on this purpose.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Course of Suppressing the Communists in the Central Hubei Area <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>After last year's flood, the people along the river in the Central District were ruined and unable to make a living. Many were willing to take risks and were incited by the communist bandits. The central government was also too busy with disaster relief to handle the suppression. Therefore, the bandit forces gradually increased. The bandits used the flood to coerce the people to flee north and seek food in the highlands. After the flood receded, they gradually moved east, planning to cross the Pinghan Railway and join forces with the Xu bandits in the East District to occupy Wuhan as a base. At that time, the garrison in Hubei Province was weak and had no overall plan for suppressing the communists. They suppressed in the east and defended in the west, unable to concentrate on suppressing the bandits. As a result, the clowns jumped around and became unmanageable. This spring, Xu Yuanquan, commander of the 10th Army, led his troops to suppress the bandits, concentrating on Yingcheng and advancing westward. At that time, the communist bandits in the Central District were He Long's fake 7th Division, Duan Dechang's fake 8th Division, and Wang Yimin's fake 9th Division. Most of them were concentrated in northern Hubei. After the government army recovered Huangshi, it divided into two routes to suppress the bandits. One route was led by Hua Wenxuan, leading a part of the 49th Division to advance west. The other route was led by Zhang Zhenhan, transferring a part of the 41st and 48th Divisions to advance. Hua's troops advanced to Wamiaoji and were surrounded by bandits. Zhang's troops were also trapped in Daijiahe City. The Red Army and militia surrounding the two troops numbered about 100,000, and the situation was extremely tense. The rear urgently dispatched reinforcements from Zaoshi to rescue them. In the Baimamiao area, they confronted the bandits for a month. Later, Hua and Zhang's two troops bravely broke through the encirclement and joined forces with the Baimamiao reinforcements, defeating the communist bandits. In this battle, the communist bandits spent a lot of bullets and suffered extremely heavy casualties. He Long and Wang Yimin led the remnants to flee back to Honghu, while Duan Dechang fled west. The government army split up to pursue the bandits. One route tracked south from Laoxinkou, another route attacked Fengkou from Mianyang, and another route advanced west from Qianjiang. They engaged in fierce battles with the bandits in Laoxinkou, Xingouji, and Yanglinguan. The 41st Division, which pursued the communist bandits on the northern route, occupied Laoxinkou. The bandits fled from Xingouji to Yanglinguan, and encountered the government army. They were hit head-on and fled back to Xingouji. At that time, Xingouji had already been occupied by the 41st Division, but the bandits did not know, and were surrounded. Most of them were disarmed. The communist bandits' important political workers Lu, Xia Xi, and Ma Wu were all captured. The bandit forces then fell into a slump. He Tu led the remnants to flee west, and the old nest of Honghu was taken like a bamboo splitting. The suppression of bandits in the Central District came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Inspection of Yingcheng, Changjiangbu <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Our reporter traveled with the inspection team on the 7th, departing from Hankou by car. The Central China District Headquarters dispatched Councilor Wang Yiqun, Adjutant Han Mutao, and Tenth Army Chief of Staff Yang Shaodong to assist along the way. They set off at 9:45 AM, heading northwest along the Chuanhan Railway base. The Chuanhan Railway was the fuse that ignited the Xinhai Revolution. The Qing Dynasty borrowed British funds to build over 200 li of railway base. Construction was halted after the change of era, and now only ruins remain. Ten li from Hankou, a German-style fort stands. The fort is circular, about thirty feet high, divided into four or five levels, with cannons mounted around it for all-round firing. Trenches were dug in front, and electric fences were installed, with soldiers stationed for defense. This was because during the rampant activities of the communists, there were rumors of attacks on Hankou, causing great alarm, with several scares in one night. The fort was built for defense against any eventuality. At the 40 li mark, in the Maoerhe area, the bridge was destroyed by the communists in November last year and has not yet been repaired. From there west to Yingcheng, all bridges passed were burned, demonstrating the extent of communist activity. The Central China District communists used Caohu as their base in the east, and then moved eastward, sending plainclothes teams to disrupt transportation to prevent government troops from suppressing them. The communist strategy for ravaging the region was to divide it into "red zones" and "gray zones." In the red zones, the communists implemented communism, treating it as occupied territory. The gray zones were unoccupied areas, where they conducted harassment, sabotage, and intimidation before eventually occupying them and turning them into red zones. Previously, the area west of Xin'andu and east of Yingcheng was considered a gray zone by the communists and was constantly harassed. At 10:45 AM, the car arrived at Xin'andu. In January of this year, the bridge there was burned by the communists, and the village was looted twice. Around 1:00 PM, they reached Manjiagang and Maijiahe, where the three counties of Yunmeng, Xiaogan, and Yingcheng meet. This place is about 100 li from Hankou, and the communists had been there several times, only looting and leaving without occupying it for long. They then arrived at Changjiangbu, a large rural town that had been attacked several times by the communists and suffered some damage. Residents are now gradually returning. At 3:00 PM, they arrived in Yingcheng for inspection. Yingcheng is the center for suppressing communists in Central China and is very important. It was attacked by the communists two or three times but was not captured due to the resolute defense of the garrison and local militia. In February of this year, a large force advanced to suppress the communists, concentrating on Yingcheng and first clearing the communist nest in Caohu. In April, the communists were defeated, and their base in Caohu was captured. The communists near Yingcheng were then cleared. The city of Yingcheng is still in good condition, as it was not devastated by the communists. However, the surrounding rural areas suffered terribly from the communist ravages. The local authorities are now working hard to revitalize the area, establishing a Post-War Relief Committee to plan everything. For self-defense, there is a Security Team reorganized from the militia and a Communist Suppression Volunteer Army. The Security Team has about 800 men throughout the county, and the Volunteer Army is organized by able-bodied men from various villages. The county has convenient transportation, with telephone and telegraph, making it easy to assemble the Security Team and Volunteer Army. (Reported from Yingcheng on December 7th)</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Jiaodong Incident has been resolved. Liu Zhennian's troops are being transferred to Zhejiang and Fujian. The Second Brigade stationed in Laiyang was the first to depart, followed by the direct subordinate units of the division. The First Brigade will also depart soon, all overseen by Deputy Division Commander He Yisan in Yantai for boarding ships. The Liu troops in Laiyang completed their withdrawal on the 6th. On the 7th, Provincial Committee and County Magistrate Yang Yougui entered the city from Shuigoutou to take over. Laizhou is a bit farther from Yantai, and its base, so the withdrawal was delayed. Today, news from Laizhou indicates that the Independent Brigade of Zhang Luanji's troops stationed in Laizhou began heading to Yantai on the 8th. By the 9th, they had completely withdrawn from Laizhou. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Zhao Hongze immediately sent forty members of the United Village Association from Shahe at noon to clean up the city first. Zhao led the county government and various bureau personnel from Shahe into the city at 8:00 AM on the 10th. Because the local losses after the war were severe, they are now working on post-disaster relief. They also telegraphed the provincial government to report. Since the sudden outbreak of the Jiaodong Incident, Laizhou was occupied by Liu Zhennian, and the county government moved to Shahe for three months. Now that the Liu army has withdrawn, they have finally been able to return to the county seat, and provincial administration has been unified. (December 11th)</p>

<p>In the case of the robbery of the Songjiang branch of the China Industrial Bank in our city, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested six suspects, including Niu Jinpu. According to their confessions, Ji Yiming, alias Xu Xinke, was the actual perpetrator.

The county government of our county prepared to send Yang Shijie, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, to Shanghai by car on the 12th evening, to appeal to the First Special District Court to bring the suspect back to our county for trial. However, the court determined that the suspect had appealed the original verdict and ordered that they wait until the appeal was completed before coming to Shanghai to bring him back.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau yesterday submitted a request to the authorities for strict apprehension of the robbers of the Yutai steamer. The document stated: "Submitting a request for strict apprehension and solving the case quickly to ensure local safety and maintain the shipping industry due to rampant bandits, injuries to police, robbery of weapons, and serious kidnapping." Our bureau's Yutai steamer departed from Suzhou for Dongshan on the morning of the 9th, towing the company's ship and the No. 4 patrol boat of the Second District, Eighth Team, First Squad of the Water Police behind it for protection. The steamer and the company ship had over [blank space] passengers, and the Water Police patrol boat had Patrol Officer Yang Jizhong and eight policemen, eight rifles, and one Browning pistol. Around 4:00 PM, while passing the Huangyang Bay area of the newly opened river in Donggang, about 20 li from Dongshan, they suddenly encountered six bandit boats moored on both sides of the river. Over thirty bandits in total, with ten or so hiding inside the boats and the rest ambushing between the thatched sheds on both banks of the river. As the steamer approached, they rushed out from both sides, firing at the steamer and ordering it to stop. The Water Police patrol boat, upon hearing this, immediately fought bravely to resist. After fierce fighting for over twenty minutes, they were outnumbered and unable to hold out. All their weapons were robbed, three policemen were injured, and stray bullets hit passengers, killing two and injuring one. Four people were kidnapped. The Dongshan Water and Land Police teams were dispatched to suppress the bandits, but it was too late to catch up. In recent times, there have been many cases of steamers being robbed. However, this time, our bureau's Yutai steamer happened to have a Water Police patrol boat escorting it behind, and the bandits dared to open fire, resist, rob weapons, and injure police, which is a serious disregard for the law. If they are not thoroughly apprehended, what unbearable consequences can be imagined? Therefore, we submit this document, humbly requesting a swift and strict order to (the Water Police Team) to devise a method to thoroughly suppress them and ensure that the main leaders are captured and severely punished, so that the police [blank space] 3</p>

<p>Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai of the County Court received a report a few days ago stating that there was a large-scale opium den at No. 23 Sibao Lane outside the North Gate, illegally selling opium and providing lamps for smoking. Upon receiving the report, Chief Prosecutor Zhou considered that daring to openly set up opium dens and provide lamps for smoking during this time of [blank space] refusal, it was a blatant disregard for the law. Therefore, at 4:00 PM yesterday, he ordered Police Chief Li Renzhen and bailiff Li Changqing to cooperate with the police of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to investigate. At that time, the opium den owner, [blank space] Xingyi, and opium smokers Bao Wenbin, Zhao Bosheng, Wu Bingsheng, Wang Rongchang, Lu A’gen, Zhang Li’s and others were all indulging in opium, discussing national affairs.

<p>Thirty thatched huts on Yang's empty land in Futian Lane behind Tian [blank space] Bang in the city caught fire yesterday afternoon due to carelessness. The flames spread rapidly and were impossible to approach. Furthermore, the wind was strong, making it even more difficult to extinguish. By the time the firefighting team from Section One of the Central District arrived, everything was reduced to ashes. The occupants of the thatched huts cried out in distress, a scene of extreme misery. Also, the home of Zhang A’ren, a resident of Zhang Lane, north of Chengxin Bridge in the Third District, caught fire around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, and flames shot through the roof, spreading to the homes of neighbors Feng Shengren, Zhang Xingquan, Zhang A’ju, and Zhang Renquan, causing losses of approximately four to five thousand yuan. Also, the home of Zhang A’gan in Zhang Bridge, Yangming [blank space] Township in the same district, also caught fire that evening, burning down two [blank space] houses and over ten shi of white rice, causing losses of six to seven hundred yuan. Also, near the Yinglong Bridge Gengyu Cloth Factory in the West Gate, there were over forty thatched sheds belonging to Jiangbei, including one belonging to Zhao Changlin, who was smoking opium at home last night. Due to carelessness, he accidentally knocked over the opium lamp, causing a fire that burned for three hours, reducing over forty thatched sheds to ashes. Fortunately, the firefighting teams from Sections One, Two, and Three nearby arrived on the scene and made every effort to extinguish the fire, saving the workshop of the Gengyu Cloth Factory.

<p>Thoughts of Chinese and Russian Figures on the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</p>
<h3 id="e104">Wu Chao-chu Talks About Good International Influence, Laiwen Talks About Important Commercial Relationships <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Chinese envoy Wu Chao-chu is scheduled to go to Beijing today from Shanghai to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wu at his residence yesterday and asked for his opinion on the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia and the content of the proposals for the plenary session. He kindly received the reporter and gave a detailed answer as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries have long had diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. The movement for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is also actively underway recently. Diplomatic relations between China and Russia have been severed since 1927, more than five years ago. The resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia is indeed a beneficial thing that should be done at present. Now, the governments of China and Russia have announced that, to enhance friendly relations between the two countries, they will formally resume normal diplomatic and consular relations from yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday). This move will have a good impact internationally. However, the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia will have a minor impact on the Sino-Japanese problem, but it is feared that there will be no major changes. Whether Soviet Russia can assist our country in solving the Northeast problem, of course, we cannot predict it before Soviet Russia has clearly expressed its views. However, the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia is a beneficial thing that should be done, and this is indeed an unquestionable and definite fact.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Sino-Japanese Problem <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations has now handed the Sino-Japanese problem over to the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations to discuss solutions. The Sino-Japanese problem cannot be resolved by the League of Nations Executive Council, nor can it be resolved by the League of Nations General Assembly. Whether the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations can produce a satisfactory solution is indeed a worrying question. In my personal observation, the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations may also find it difficult to produce a successful solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. However, the United States recently stated that if the position of the League of Nations differs from that of the United States, the US government will refuse to participate in the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations. This statement is tantamount to a warning to the League of Nations, and this warning may make the work of the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations smoother. In short, if we rely solely on others for the Northeast problem, it will be difficult to obtain good results. The Chinese people must use their own strength to plan for solving the Northeast problem. The Volunteer Army is now fighting hard against the enemy in the Northeast, exerting its own strength and actively proceeding to recover lost territory. It is deeply hoped that compatriots throughout the country will enthusiastically assist the front line, and do not allow the Volunteer Army in the Northeast to be like General Su Bingwen's exhaustion of ammunition and supplies, leaving the country in tears. I am scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow (that is, today) to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and I have prepared four proposals: 1. the Sino-Japanese problem, 2. disarmament, 3. industrial development, and 4. the establishment of popular opinion organs. The above four proposals have now been drafted and will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion. As for the content, it must wait until it is registered by the secretariat of the plenary session before it can be officially announced. At the moment, it cannot be published. Mr. Sun Zhesheng is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight (that is, last night) first.</p>

<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Laiwen, the Shanghai commercial representative of Soviet Russia, yesterday and asked about the attitude of Russian expatriates after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. According to the conversation, the Russian side is even more delighted about this. The Russian side is even more pleased about this. It believes that China and the Soviet Union not only have important diplomatic relations, but also very important commercial relations. From now on, expatriates from both countries can also mutually enjoy the convenience of the resumption of diplomatic relations. It is hoped that the people of China and the Soviet Union will continue to work hard to move forward. The former Soviet Russian Consulate in front of the Waibaidu Bridge, which is currently being held in trust by him, may soon be restored. Another Russian then asked the reporter about the attitude of the Shanghai press towards this matter. The reporter replied that the issue of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union has been introduced by the press, and now that it has been realized, everyone is of course happy. Finally, the reporter asked whether there was news that Su Bingwen's family members and others had come to Shanghai from Vladivostok. Laiwen replied that he had not received a telegram.</p>

<p>▲The British Firm Lyen Line Entrusts HSBC to Sell on Its Behalf</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government is issuing six million yuan of Revival Public Bonds for the revival of the war zone, using the income from dockage fees as collateral. Now, the regulations and draft agreement have been approved by the Executive Yuan one after another. Four million has already been underwritten by the British firm Lyen Line, and the remaining two million yuan of public bonds are scheduled to be sold by HSBC on behalf of the firm tomorrow (the 15th). The information obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Issuance Method <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>These six million yuan of Revival Public Bonds are entirely for the revival of post-war municipal undertakings. The interest rate is seven percent per week, and there will be two lotteries. The municipal government will use the income from dockage fees in the city as funds for repayment of principal and interest. The face value is set at 1,000 yuan and 100 yuan denominations, which can be freely mortgaged and sold, and can also be used as guarantee deposits, collateral, or foundation reserve funds for public affairs in Shanghai or public organizations. The six million yuan of public bonds are all underwritten by the British firm Lyen Line.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Cai Zengji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, to inquire about the method by which Lyen Line is underwriting the Revival Public Bonds. According to the conversation, the temporary contract has been approved by the Executive Yuan and sent to the municipal government. As for Lyen Line, the other party underwriting, the time for [blank space] decision is when the temporary contract is formally approved by the Executive Yuan and sent to Shanghai, and after the other party has reviewed the approval and found it to be correct, it will be effective. Therefore, there is no need to handle a formal contract or signing procedures separately. The draft agreement will serve as the formal contract. The total amount of public bonds is six million yuan. Except for the four million underwritten by Lyen Line, the remaining two million will be dispersed outside, so it is now scheduled to be sold by HSBC tomorrow (the 15th) from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and from 1:00 PM to 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The first installment of the funds has not yet been paid to the municipal government. It will probably not be long before it is paid.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Reviewing the Approval <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the Executive Yuan's approval of Shanghai's issuance of six million yuan of Revival Public Bonds arrived in Shanghai yesterday, at 11:00 AM, Westerners from the British firm Lyen Line and HSBC each went to the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Government to review the original approval as a basis for it to take effect. Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau, accompanied and received them, and met with Secretary-General Yu to read it. Both parties were satisfied and dispersed at noon. Later, the reporter learned from other sources that the city's dockage fee income was about 700,000 yuan last year, with about 150,000 yuan receivable each quarter. This fund will now be used as the fund for repayment of principal and interest on the public bonds. (Guo Wen She)</p>

He visited General Manager Liu Hongsheng the day before yesterday morning. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with General Manager Liu Hongsheng yesterday, who stated that he has now received an order from the Ministry appointing Ao Doubo as a consultant for a three-month trial period. After it is submitted to the sixth board meeting at 4:00 PM on Thursday and passed, he will be notified to go to the bureau to take up his duties.

<p>The China Merchants Bureau Machinery Factory is located in Lujiazui, Pudong, and has been out of operation for a long time. Since General Manager Liu took office, he has been working hard to reorganize it.

<p>The labor union of the five wharves of the bureau, because the bureau appointed He Tiehua as the new director of the North Wharf, automatically convened a general meeting of all members of the North Wharf branch to request the union's board to petition the general bureau's board and General Manager Liu to demand the withdrawal of the order to resolve the dispute. More than ten representatives went to the bureau to petition on the 12th, asking for the reason for demanding that He Tiehua be the North Wharf director. However, General Manager Liu refused to withdraw the order. The representatives could not get their wish and returned to the union to report. All members were extremely angry upon hearing this and convened an emergency general meeting of all members at the North Wharf at 11:00 AM yesterday, immediately resolving two measures: 1. If He Tiehua comes to the wharf to take over, he will be refused to be handed over in unison; 2. Organize a refusal He group, with other people responsible for the work. It is also heard that the South, Central, China, New, and Fourth wharves have convened general meetings of members separately to prepare for unified action. In addition, the employees of the Shantou branch, because they found out about the bad deeds of the branch director Tang and refused to enter the bureau, caused a strike on the 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e118">He Tiehua's View <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>He Tiehua, the director of the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, told the visitor yesterday that he has always been strict and upright in handling affairs and has won the trust of the bureau, so he was ordered to take over the North Wharf. The union [blank space] claimed that the matter of the porcelain of the Hankou Bureau had been reported to the general bureau and advertised for auction, and so far the buyers have not said anything different. Why is it said to be a suspicious case? As for the ironware management [blank space] the iron employees have always been under the management of the foreign manager and not connected to the director of the wharf. Later, because the ironware was often missing, he was ordered to thoroughly investigate and report to the former Commissioner Guo, and the former general manager approved that the director of the wharf would not be responsible. The remaining exceptional wages during the 128 Shanghai War, [blank space] were the exceptional wages paid by the bureau as a reward to employees, and there are names listed on the list, all of which are reviewed by the goods management director [blank space] Bailing [blank space] and reported to the general bureau. Huang Zhiqiang and others also have salary books to check their salaries. The Song Dianyuan case was identified by Jiang Chengpei and Qin Shenqin as a matter of rectifying discipline, and he was ordered to be suspended, and it cannot be said that there was malice. How can the union arbitrarily spread rumors and confuse the audience? In short, he has always been strict in handling affairs, which has caused dissatisfaction among some people, but such unfounded remarks are not worth refuting.</p>

<p>A telegram was received last night asking to send a steamer to tow it to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Datong Company's Hongda steamer, on a regular route, departed from Shanghai for Yangzhou yesterday morning. Suddenly, it was reported that the steamer was seized by pirates. Upon hearing the news, the reporter went to various parties to investigate and learned that the steamer seemed to have been seized. What the details are, there will be confirmed news today.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Company Telephoned Urgently to Inquire <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Hongda steamer left Shanghai at 2:00 AM yesterday (the 13th), loaded with goods and passengers to be exported to various ports such as Tongzhou and Yangzhou. The company suddenly received a report yesterday afternoon stating that the Hongda steamer was seized by pirates, but the details were unknown. At that time, the Zhida steamer happened to be returning to Shanghai from Yangzhou. The company immediately asked the crew of the steamer if they had seen Hongda on the way. The crew of the steamer replied that they had not seen it. The company urgently telegraphed the Tongzhou branch at 2:00 PM to inquire, but there has been no response, so how the steamer actually is, the company has no confirmed news.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Passengers and Goods Carried on the Steamer <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>According to the above situation, it seems that the pirates were pre-arranged on the ship and only acted halfway. Inquiring with the company staff about whether there were valuable passengers or goods, it was said that this time, in addition to more than a hundred baskets of soybean oil and more than a hundred pieces of tobacco, the rest were scattered items and there were no valuable goods. As for the passengers, they were under the responsibility of the ship's compradore, and the company was not sure.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Afternoon, Still No News <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The company, after inquiring from all sides, has learned that the robbery has indeed been confirmed. However, there are no reports regarding the location and current situation of the ship this afternoon, and there is no way to inquire. We can only wait for definite news before discussing further measures. It is rumored that the incident occurred outside the Wusongkou, and the pirates took the people and the ship to Daquyang. It is also possible that we will have detailed news today.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 4:30 PM, Datong Company received a telegram from a small island at the mouth of the Yangtze River stating that when the Hongda ship was leaving the port, it was attacked by nine pirates, each armed with weapons, who boarded the ship and robbed for several hours, damaging the machinery severely, resulting in substantial losses. The ship is now docked near a small island, requesting immediate towing back to Shanghai for repairs, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Station Was in Complete Turmoil All Day Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<h3 id="e126">Villagers in Pengpu District Attempted to Petition in Beijing, Requesting Vehicle Allocation, but the Railway Bureau Did Not Approve It. The Situation Was Resolved After Mediation by the Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau. <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Villagers in the Pengpu District had previously petitioned the Railway Department repeatedly regarding the construction of a new site for the railway, requesting consideration of the people's hardships and a reduction in the land acquisition, but to no avail. They then agreed to go to the North Station yesterday morning with all the farmers to take a train to Beijing to petition. A total of seven hundred men, women, and children gathered and set off. However, the two railway authorities, seeing too many people, stopped them, which led to a conflict. As a result, forty people still took the train to Beijing. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Departure Situation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, while it was still dark, villagers from the entire Pengpu District, carrying the old and supporting the young, gathered in the town. At that time, the crowd was dense, about seven hundred people. The villagers elected Hou Xuanqing, Tao Wenyuan, Zhao Youting, Zhang Zhongxiang, Zhao Wenxiu, Hou Shizhang, and six others as representatives, and ten inspectors to lead the way to the North Station. They arrived at the North Railway Station at eight o'clock. Each villager wore a cloth badge identifying them as Pengpu Petitioning Villagers and carried petition flags, dispersing inside and outside the station.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Requesting Vehicle Allocation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>After arriving at the station, the representatives, led by Hou Xuanqing, contacted the railway authorities to negotiate for vehicles. Because this petition concerned petitioning the Railway Department in Beijing, Fan Zhaolan, the special commissioner of the two railway police departments, Lin Zengding, the police chief, and many inspectors from the Public Security Bureau, due to the large number of petitioning victims, found it inconvenient and politely refused, but the villagers did not agree and insisted on taking a train to Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Dispute Arises <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>At twelve o'clock, there was still no result. The villagers wanted to take a train to Beijing at 12:15. As the train was about to depart, they crowded into the station and tried to board the train automatically. Zhang Yingxin, the ticket collector at the platform, stopped them, which led to a conflict with two elderly women among the villagers, Tan Li (64 years old) and Tao Zhu (43 years old). Seeing this, the villagers were very upset and came forward to negotiate with Zhang, tearing off his clothes buttons. Later, the police department summoned Zhang to the department, and the matter was resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Delaying Train Departure <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>After this incident, many villagers crossed the platform to the tracks to prevent the 12:45 express train from departing. At that time, the Public Security Bureau sent additional inspectors to mediate, and Commissioner Fan also agreed to allow the six representatives to take the train to Beijing for free. The representatives of the villagers then persuaded the villagers not to stand on the tracks and to wait for the train to depart. The express train was able to depart, but it was delayed until 1:30.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Discussing Numbers <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Later, the representatives of the villagers negotiated with the Railway Bureau again. The Railway Bureau only allowed six people to travel free of charge. If everyone went to Beijing, they had to buy tickets to sit down, but the villagers did not agree and were willing to send sixty people to Beijing for free, and the rest would return home.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Preventing Vehicles Again <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Police Chief Lin Zenghua and Police Commissioner Fan Zhaolan continued to negotiate with the representatives of the villagers. The villagers firmly demanded that one hundred people go to Beijing. It was already three o'clock, and the second express train was about to depart at three o'clock. In order to prevent another train obstruction incident, Lin and others agreed to negotiate with the Railway Bureau, but after the negotiation, Lin and others replied that the Railway Bureau had no solution. The villagers were very angry. At this time, it was discovered that the Shanghai-Changzhou train at four o'clock was also about to depart, so they rushed to the platform and stopped the four o'clock train.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Firing Trend <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>At this time, a railway policeman on the platform suddenly fired a gun into the air as a warning. Fortunately, the bullets went upwards and did not injure anyone. A railway policeman firefighter also took a leather dragon head and sprayed water on the villagers. The villagers were even more motivated and dragged the firefighter out, forcibly tearing off his uniform symbols before releasing him to vent their anger. A large number of people still rushed to the platform to block the front of the train, not allowing it to depart. The train had to be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Special Martial Law <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>At this time, the Public Security Bureau received the news and immediately sent seven or eighty policemen from the Fifth District, along with more than three hundred security guards, to surround the station. Only exiting the station was allowed, and entering the station was prohibited. At the same time, a patrol car from the Concession arrived and stopped in front of Laifenglou on the border road. Fifty or sixty Chinese and foreign patrolmen temporarily imposed martial law. Passengers from Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai were not allowed to leave their houses if they lingered on the border road. More than two thousand passengers arriving in Shanghai were temporarily blocked at the station, unable to cross the line.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Wen's Mediation <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Police Department saw the tense situation and reported it to the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, asking him to come and mediate as soon as possible. Wen arrived in a car with his entourage at five o'clock in the afternoon and explained to the representatives of the villagers and verbally agreed on two conditions: ㈠ The Railway Bureau would issue a free round-trip ticket (which would allow ten people to ride). ㈡ Seven representatives from the villagers would persuade the villagers to explain the difficulties of taking the train. The seven representatives agreed to proceed, and sent Zhao Wenxiu and Hou Xuanqing to explain to the villagers. As a result, they were satisfied but stated that if the petition in Beijing was unsuccessful, they would still take the train to Beijing as a whole. A storm was resolved, and it was already 7:30. The Shanghai-Changzhou train, which had been scheduled for four o'clock, departed at 7:30.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Result: Going to Beijing <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Last night, after Wen Hongen mediated, the villagers were dismissed by the representatives and ordered to return home, but thirty men remained. The thirty men bought tickets and went to Beijing with the ten people, making a total of forty people going to Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e138">A Record of the Martyrdom of Gao Wenbin, Commander of the Fifth Military District of the Volunteer Army <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Unbowed to the End, Worthy of Song and Tears</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Gao Wenbin, commander of the Fifth Military District of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, died in Tieling. The outline of the situation was reported in the previous newspaper. Now, Jiang Xing, the deputy captain of the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team, who returned to Shanghai from the front line, told reporters the details of the death of Commander Gao Wenbin, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Reconnaissance and Arrest <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Gao Wenbin's Fifth Military District was stationed near the Rebian area. In the past year, they had fought hard against the Japanese army, so the Japanese army hated them. On the 27th of last month, Commander Gao Wenbin of the district led dozens of guards to Tieling to reconnoiter the enemy's situation. Several Chinese traitors employed by the Japanese army were also reconnoitering in the area. The traitors saw Gao and immediately rushed to the Japanese army headquarters to report. After receiving the report, the Japanese army sent a battalion of infantry to the area and surrounded Gao. Gao and his guards resisted bravely, fighting for an hour, but were outnumbered and the entire army was destroyed. Gao was also captured alive.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Circumstances of the Death <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>After Gao was captured, he was taken to the Japanese army headquarters. It is said that at that time, the Japanese army severely tortured him and forced him to confess the Volunteer Army's combat plans and defense situation. Gao refused to reveal anything and said, "My head can be broken, but my will cannot be bent." At that time, the Japanese army burned the remaining captured Volunteer Army soldiers to death in front of Gao, dousing them with kerosene. Gao witnessed the tragic scene, his eyes were torn apart, and he shouted slogans such as "Long live the Republic of China, long live the Volunteer Army," and pointed at the Japanese traitors and scolded them loudly. The Japanese army, seeing that Gao's will could not be bent, ordered him to be pushed onto the execution platform. Gao Wenbin, a loyal and brave general who had been fighting with the Japanese invaders for a year, died for his country. After hearing the news, all the soldiers of the army were heartbroken. They have now been reorganized by a certain general and will fight a desperate battle with the Japanese army to avenge Gao.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Gao's History <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Gao Wenbin was 44 years old and from Liaoning. He was a very famous figure in the local Green Forest. After the September 18th Incident, he and his subordinates took an oath of blood and reorganized into the Volunteer Army, fighting against the Japanese army in the Tieling area. Later, the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Beiping appointed Gao as the commander of the Fifth Military District of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>Jiang also told reporters that after the team set off, they went from Nanjing to Beiping. At that time, they stationed the team headquarters in the New World Building in Tianqiao and visited Wang Huayi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. He was introduced to serve in Zheng Gui's unit and was also subsidized with 215 yuan for travel expenses. Then, I led the team to Lingnan County on the border of Guanzhong. We established a field hospital in the area and provided relief to displaced refugees. The weather outside the customs is extremely cold, and water drips become ice, and the rescue team is still wearing thin cotton clothes for battle. Food and medicine are also about to run out, so I returned to Shanghai to seek assistance from all walks of life.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Letter to the Guangdong Authorities <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The team telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial authorities, requesting assistance with medicines, etc. The original telegram said to Chairman Chen of the Guangdong Provincial Government, all the officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Commander-in-Chief Li Denlin of Guangxi, and General Commander Bai Jiansheng: Reading the ash telegram, I am pleased to learn that the comrades are enthusiastic about the party and the country and donated counties to assist, which is a clear demonstration of righteousness. I cannot help but admire you. Since its establishment, this team has been in existence for three months. The first team has already arrived in Jinxi, undertaking the work of the Fourth Route Army under Geng Jizhou. The second team has also arrived in Ping and will leave the customs in the near future. However, repeated telegrams have been sent to urge the sending of medicines, but donations from all walks of life are few. The team's economy is also stretched and unable to purchase. Even exhausting the lake to fish is difficult to remedy. I hereby telegraphed to all comrades, urgently requesting assistance with medical supplies so that the team can receive assistance. I am extremely eager for it. Fei Jian, Wu Huiquan, and Xu Huiren of the Shanghai Office of the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team, bow their heads.</p>

<p>Both Sides Will Formally Sign the Agreement on a Set Date</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the China Merchants Electric Tram Company in the city, in which all workers demanded a general wage increase, was submitted to the city government for arbitration after mediation by the city's Social Affairs Bureau failed. To seek a resolution, the labor and management sides directly engaged in reconciliation, and with the strong persuasion of Mr. Du Yuesheng, it was finally determined that each worker would receive a general wage increase of three yuan starting in October of this year, as well as a principle of five days of annual bonus. The company authorities specially passed a resolution at a board meeting last Saturday and appointed three directors, Lu Bohong, Zhang Xiaoliang, and Gu Xinyi, as signing representatives. The labor union also convened a temporary representative meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, attended by more than 50 responsible representatives from various departments. The meeting was chaired by Lu Jiyun, and Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Department, attended to provide guidance. After Hu Yida, the attending representative who handled the salary increase, reported the progress of the reconciliation, the discussion began. ㈠ The company has agreed that all workers in all departments will receive a general wage increase of three yuan starting in October of this year, and that the annual bonus will be increased by five days uniformly. Resolved: Passed unanimously. ㈡ It was resolved that the authorities should be requested to release Yu Jinfu, Huang Defang, Wang Hesheng, Song Rengui, and other four workers who were arrested by the Public Security Bureau during the labor dispute. Resolved: Request the Municipal Party Department to bail them out as soon as possible. ㈢ The representatives for signing the agreement were appointed. Resolved: Hu Yida, Fu Chongde, and Tan Minglin were appointed as the signing representatives. It is rumored that the formal signing will take place the day after tomorrow.</p>

Fortunately, our volunteer army is fighting to the death, which has slightly solidified the border. It is admirable and commendable.

Recently, I heard that raising cold clothes for the volunteer army is particularly urgent. The female student instructors and 21 female students in the school have responded and each made a cotton coat, totaling 22 pieces. I hope that the association will send them to the Northeast. With the labor of their ten fingers, they have fulfilled their duty as ordinary people, which shows that the daughters love the country and are not behind others. I hope they can reach the front line as soon as possible, so as to reward their ambition to go to righteousness. Please send a receipt after receiving the cotton clothes.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Investigation Record of Dike Construction in the Bandit Area (II) <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Seventh District Construction and Relief Bureau's project, the south bank of the Yangtze River, from Tashi Station in Huarong County to Majiayuan in Shiyuan, the north bank from Guanyin Island in Jianli County to Tuomaobu in Jianli County, so the Yangtze River dike project from Zhenjiang to Jianli has reached its end. The Eighth and Ninth Districts belong to the Xiang River basin. On the evening of the 7th, on the way back to Hankou from Jianli on the Wan'an wheel, after dinner, a meeting was held in the restaurant as usual. Xi Dejiong, director of the Construction and Relief Office, invited people from the press to talk about their opinions after inspecting the dike project. The crowd elected Qian Hua to deliver a speech, saying that it was a great honor for the comrades to participate in the group invited by the Water Disaster Association, and that they were very grateful for the special reception and various conveniences along the way. Regarding the dike project, the Yangtze River has been seen from afar, and the greatness of the project and the hard work and dedication of the members of the Water Disaster Association and the Construction and Relief Office, who have completed this 15,000-mile long dike in the shortest time and with the least amount of funds, are admirable. The work in the bandit area is even more difficult. Today, the comrades have experienced it firsthand, and feel the danger and difficulty of the work at that time. Therefore, the completion of this great project is enough to show the spirit of our Chinese nation uniting to save itself and bravely resisting disasters. I hope that the members of the Water Disaster Association will continue to serve the country with this valuable spirit of struggle. We must know that China is now in turmoil, and the brutality of foreign oppression is a hundred times greater than last year's flood. The life of the nation is in danger. I hope that you will guide the people with the spirit of saving the flood and building a 10,000-mile dike, and take responsibility together. The members of the press are very willing to follow you and work together to deal with foreign aggression. The revival of China can be hoped for.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Honghu Base Area <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The red bandits in Hubei are most famous for He Long's troops in the central Hubei area. He Long took Honghu as his base, which was recovered by the Tenth Army in September of this year. Hua Wenxuan, commander of the 5th division, who took the Wan'an wheel to Jianli, actually participated in the previous and subsequent battles. According to Hua, Honghu was the seat of the Soviet government of the Xiang-E-Xi province, and the facilities were relatively complete. There were armories, wounded soldier hospitals, prisons, Lenin schools, mints, and military academies, as well as a Lenin warship and two airplanes. Although the scale was very small and the machinery was very simple, there was still considerable output every day. The important organs of the red bandits were all underground. A large hole was dug in the ground, covered with wood and grass, and the structure was strong to prevent attacks by the national army's aircraft. A post office was also set up in the bandit area, with red stamps, one side with Lenin's image and the reverse side with a sickle and axe, and the Soviet silver dollars used were also the same. The bandit soldiers wore black uniforms. When they captured cities, the looted property had to be handed over to the bandit government and deposited in the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. The copper coins obtained were distributed to the soldiers for use. Soldiers and civilians were not allowed to hoard silver dollars worth more than three yuan. Except for the special affairs officers and quartermasters in the battalion, no foreign currency was named. The red bandits paid great attention to propaganda. Slogans were posted everywhere, and there were countless kinds of them. This was especially true during wartime. There were newspapers such as the Red Flag Newspaper and Weekly War Reports. The effectiveness of the propaganda was greatest in the winter of the year before last and the spring of last year. Even seducing the army everywhere, and using women to lure them, so at that time, suppressing bandits was only a name, but in fact, there was no battle. The wounded soldier hospital was empty. Later, the true colors of the red bandits were revealed, the propaganda lost its effectiveness, and it finally failed. All the strong men in the bandit area were forcibly conscripted, and a committee for desertion was set up. When a certain place was defeated and abandoned, the committee led the entire village of men, women, and children to flee, with only a few disabled people left behind. ㈠ To prevent the leakage of various military news in the bandit area, ㈡ To cause food shortages in the areas occupied by the national army. The bandits had four kinds of slogans for dealing with the national army's plans: ㈠ You go, I chase, ㈡ You station, I go, ㈢ You chase, I avoid, ㈣ You avoid, I attack, which is what the art of war says, avoid the real and attack the emptiness. The national army has been suppressing bandits for years, but has never succeeded. This is the reason. When the Tenth Army attacked the bandit nest in Honghu, many prisoners were captured, including many members of the false provincial government. Most of the houses were burned by the bandits, and the old, weak, and women who returned successively temporarily built thatched sheds to live in. The desolation was full of sight and could not be restored in a few years. The bandits were most well-informed about the news of the national army. There were many telegraph and telephone specialists. Most of the confidential telegrams sent by the national army were stolen. The recent theft of the headquarters' confidential telegram book was also related to the red bandits. I once searched for the diary of an important bandit leader in the Honghu nest of the red bandits. The phone reports of our side during the war were recorded in the book in detail, without any difference. This is also the work of the telephone worm. Whenever a stranger entered the bandit area, there was intelligence from all sides, reporting to governments at all levels for close surveillance. Strangers and villagers were not allowed to talk directly, otherwise they would be charged with counter-revolution. Therefore, it was almost impossible for the national army's detectives to inquire. The villagers feared the bandits like tigers. Even after the bandit army was defeated, they dared not tell the truth when the national army inquired, for fear of the bandits coming again. The reporter inquired about the situation of the red bandits from the village elders in the bandit area, but they always spoke vaguely. If asked firmly, they said it was still good. Under the accumulated power, it is really difficult for the common people. After arriving in Jianli, the headquarters' Recovery of Disaster Area Rural Financial Relief Office landed and went to Honghu, Qianjiang, and other places to conduct on-site investigations of agriculture and forestry. The reporter wanted to go with them, but due to time constraints, he could not do so, which was a great pity.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Strategies for Bandit Area Relief <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The reporter returned to Hankou from Jianli and met a certain military authority, who said that the reasons for suppressing the red bandits this time were: ㈠ Chiang, the military chairman, sat in Hanzhong and concentrated the military forces of the three provinces, unified command, and launched an attack on the bandit area, making it impossible for the bandits to take care of each other. ㈡ Concentrate political talents to handle the aftermath of the bandit area. ㈢ The people in the bandit area all felt the deception of the red bandits and had automatically awakened. During the advance of the large army, they automatically organized a anti-communist volunteer team to assist the national army in searching for the remaining bandits in the area. ㈣ The three provincial armies attacked at the same time, which invisibly blocked the bandit area and cut off the bandits' food and other material supplies, making it impossible for the bandits to hold out for long. ㈤ The red bandits were divided internally due to the removal of the reform faction, and the mutual feuding greatly reduced their strength. As for the aftermath of recovering the bandit area, the following matters should be handled completely with political power, so that it can be a permanent solution and the red bandits will not relapse: ㈠ Actively organize volunteer teams in each county and village to consolidate the people's self-defense force, strictly enforce household registration investigations, and implement mutual guarantee and joint responsibility, so that the bandits have no place to hide. ㈢ Actively handle rural relief so that returning farmers have a livelihood. ㈣ After the household registration investigation is clear, immediately set up cooperatives to gradually stabilize the lives of farmers. ㈤ Appoint troops to build roads in designated areas to facilitate traffic in the bandit area and prevent the bandits from hiding. ㈥ Use political power to engage in production, transfer and introduce financial services. The Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters has now established a Disaster Area Rural Financial Relief Office to recover and for the restoration of farmland in the bandit area, and there are three methods: ㈠ Those who have deeds will return the original field. ㈡ Those whose deeds have been lost can also be returned with the testimony of the four neighbors or village elders. ㈢ Those whose deeds have been lost and no one can testify for them, the land will be managed by the Rural Revitalization Committee, and the benefits of hiring farmers to cultivate the land will be used for rural revitalization. In addition, there are loan relief measures, etc., which can be implemented one after another after the on-site investigation of the rural area is completed.

<h3 id="e155">Report of the Embankment Inspection Group <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Ten Days of Observing the Embankment Works of the Yangtze River, Contributing Opinions on the Embankment Works of the Han River</p>
<p>The Embankment Inspection Group reported to Chairman Song, stating: "Respected Chairman Song of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, upon receiving the telegram inviting inspection, the team inspected the Xujiawan Embankment in Jiujiang County on the morning of the 2nd of this month, and the Maqikou Embankment in Guangji County and the Chengzhen Embankment in Yangxin County in the afternoon. After arriving in Hankou on the 3rd, we inspected the flood control embankments along the river, as well as the Zhanggong Embankment and the Wujin Embankment in Wuchang. We found that Wuhan suffered the most severe damage during last year's flood. This time, your committee allocated grain to repair the embankments in sections, providing security for millions of lives, which is of great significance. On the 4th, we attended the tea party hosted by General Commander Chiang and the banquets hosted by the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hankou Municipal Government. On the afternoon of the 5th, we switched to the Wanan shallow-water vessel and sailed upstream to inspect the embankment works in the section from Jingkou to Huakou in Jiayu County. According to local statistics, since the construction of the embankment by the Work Relief Bureau, the area of farmland benefiting this year has exceeded one million mu. On the 6th, we inspected the Hujia Zhou Embankment in Mianyang County and the Yinjiatou and Zoumatou Embankments in Jianli County. On the 7th, we inspected the embankment works from Shangchewan to Jianli, walking thirty li. Many villages along the way were burned down by the Communist bandits. Although they have been recovered, the people have not yet fully returned, and it seems that relief for the refugees cannot be delayed. On the evening of the 8th, we returned to Hankou and stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel. In the past few days, all the embankments we passed through were within the scope of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Work Relief Bureaus. The width of the embankment surface is generally above eight meters, with an inner slope of one to three to one to five, and an outer slope also beyond one to three. The work is generally solid. According to local people, the personnel of the work relief bureaus entering and leaving the bandit areas have suffered greatly and have been killed. However, the workers have completed the work to the end, and their spirit of hardship and excellence is admirable. Moreover, the area from Wuhan westward in Hubei is mostly swamp, and the people rely on the embankments for protection. Therefore, the magnitude of the construction of the embankments far exceeds that of other places. However, residents inevitably build houses arbitrarily on the embankments or plant cotton and bean plants on the slopes. If this is not prohibited, it will inevitably affect the entire project. This is one point. The Hubei Water Conservancy Bureau has dumped stones in dangerous areas along the riverbank, but the paving is not entirely adequate. It seems that the Jianghan Engineering Bureau should be employed to repair them to prevent collapse. Also, the Yangtze River is particularly curved upstream from Hankou, especially in places like Paizhou, Luzhou, and Dama Zhou, where the straight-line distance is only a few miles, but the boat trip around is more than ten miles away. For the convenience of transportation and the protection of good farmland, it seems that these areas should be reorganized as soon as possible. This is the second point. Regarding the above two points, we propose that your committee forward them to the relevant agencies for special attention to benefit the people of Hubei. We plan to take the Han River route on the 10th to inspect the Han River embankment works managed by the Eighth and Ninth Districts. All the circumstances of the inspection of the embankment works from Hankou upstream to Jianli are hereby reported in advance for your review. Members of the Embankment Inspection Group: Wen Lanting, Zhou Xiangxian, Li Zu, Qian Hua, Lu Yi, Hu Chuanyuan, Zhu Yunguang, Pan Zeji, Chen Shizhang, Guo Wen, Wang Yinping, Stroeh Ford Frn-goh, etc., and all members, respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e156">Protection Corps Members Imprisoned for Official Duties, All Protection Corps in Pudong Request Vindication <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xialing, a member of the Tangqiao District Protection Corps in Pudong, shot and killed Jiang Guohua, a petitioning police officer from the Second District, who resisted arrest by firing a gun while being questioned as a suspect in July of this year. Recently, the local court suddenly detained Yang Xialing during the continued trial of the case, causing public outrage among the people of Pudong. The members of the district protection corps even wanted to resign en masse in support. All merchants in the district also believed that Mr. Yang was imprisoned for official duties and specially established a support association to provide unanimous assistance. In addition, all protection corps in the entire Pudong area also believed that Mr. Yang's detention was unfair and provided unanimous support. Xu Baoming, the leader of the Yangjing District Corps, Wang Hui, the leader of the Tangqiao District Corps, and Chen Xin, the leader of the Yangsi District Corps, etc., visited Zhang Tingrong, the chairman of the Management Committee of the Pudong Protection Corps, yesterday to discuss rescue procedures. Mr. Zhang also believed that the corps member was imprisoned for official duties and should be rescued according to law. It was decided that the management committee would report to the municipal government and forward a letter to the court to release Yang Xialing on bail according to law to appease public anger. The submission is recorded below: "Presented: Corps members imprisoned for official duties, public anger is difficult to calm, and the corps is about to disintegrate. It is requested to present to the municipal government and forward a letter to the court to quickly grant bail, hoping for review. It is learned that Second-Class Police Officer Jiang Guohua privately carried a box gun, requested leave to go out, did not return after the deadline, and secretly went to Shengjia Hua in Tangqiao Town, Pudong, with accomplices in plain clothes. Because he was questioned by the district protection corps, he resisted arrest by firing a gun, resulting in his death by the corps member Yang Xialing in self-defense. The case was reported to the local court for verification, and Jiang's family filed a lawsuit with the court. The details of the incident have been presented for review and approved to be presented to the municipal government for the record. It is learned that this case has been repeatedly summoned by the court. The protection corps is innocent and the truth is clear. Corps member Yang Xialing must attend every hearing when summoned, and the court has granted bail. However, on the 8th of this month, corps member Yang was summoned to court and suddenly detained without bail. When the local area heard the news, they all believed that corps member Yang was imprisoned for protecting the local area by investigating criminals, causing public outrage. All corps members are about to stop winter defense immediately, and merchants are also terrified, and are starting to provide assistance together. Although the corps leader tried his best to persuade them to calm down, public sentiment is indignant, and it is impossible to quell without redress. Thinking that at this time of hunger and cold, local villains are trying their best to do evil, and the protection corps is doing its best to defend the area and carry out winter defense, which is no small matter. If they lose heart, disintegrate, and stop defending, it will have a significant impact on local security. Therefore, it is presented for review and it is requested to immediately present to the municipal government and quickly send a letter to the local court to immediately release Yang Xialing. No matter how the verdict is pronounced, he should be allowed to continue to be released on bail to calm public anger and stabilize the local area. It is impossible to be more urgent. Sincerely presented."</p>

<h3 id="e158">French Academy Awards This Year's Julien Prize <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper published a Havavas dispatch from Paris, stating that a French society awarded a prize to the Academia Sinica. Upon inquiring with Mr. Yang Xingfo, the executive director of the Academia Sinica, about the details, Mr. Yang replied that this matter was seen in a cable from Paris this spring. The Academia Sinica did not know the details. Later, they received a letter from the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres of the French Academy on March 5, stating that this year's Julien Prize was awarded to the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, partly because of the published collections and other related publications of the institute, especially the Anyang Excavation Report compiled by Li Ji and others. The prize money is a small matter, but it is gratifying that part of the work of the Academia Sinica has been praised by the national academic institution of a friendly country. The authority of the French Academy (Institut de France) in the world of academia is unparalleled. This is well known to the world. Among them, the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres (Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres) is specifically responsible for ancient studies, linguistics, oriental studies, etc. Its position in ancient studies, linguistics, and oriental studies is also a leader. When asked about the work of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, Mr. Yang said that the institute is divided into three groups. The first group is history, which is currently organizing the archives of the Ming and Qing dynasties' Grand Secretariat and studying classical texts, epigraphy, and northwest history and geography and Tibetan and Mongolian languages. The second group is linguistics, which studies phonetic experiments, investigates dialects, and organizes rhyme books. The third group is archaeology, which has excavated the Yin Ruins for eight seasons, and the results have attracted the attention and praise of most archaeologists in the world. It has also jointly established the Shandong Antiquities Research Association with the Shandong Provincial Government and has excavated Suoyitan City. It has also jointly established the Henan Antiquities Research Association with the Henan Provincial Government and is currently excavating Junxian, all of which have major discoveries. All the work and results of the institute can be found in the published publications of the institute, which have now been published in dozens of volumes and cannot be fully described here.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Whether the Skeletal Remains of the Female Ghost Are Human Is Still Unclear, Blood Stains Are Currently Being Tested... Expected to Be Completed by the End of the Month <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The case of the female ghost discovered in Xianqin Temple in Yixing, which was once widely reported, has attracted attention from all sectors of society since the military stationed in the temple unsealed and excavated the skeletal remains and other items. The skeletal remains have been transferred by the Yixing County Government to the Academia Sinica and then to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for separate testing. It is understood that the skeletal remains have been examined and the blood stains are currently being tested. The entire process is expected to be completed within a month. Yesterday, someone took a car to the institute in Zhenru to investigate the details of the case. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Beginning and End of the Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Although everything has been repeatedly reported since the beginning of this case, it is still not completely clear. According to Lin Ji, the director of the Zhenru Forensic Institute, after the Fourth Regiment of the Provincial Security Infantry奉命 moved into Xianqin Temple outside the South Gate of Yixing, several rooms on the right side of the Prajna Hall in the backyard became the medical clinic, and one room on the left was used by the monks to store sundries, which was tightly sealed. The nurses in the medical clinic often stayed overnight, and some sick soldiers entered. At that time, there was often a crying sound in the empty room every night, and the sound was sharp. The soldiers were alarmed and ran away. The ninth company commander, Fan Zhengwen, reported the situation to Xu Qijin, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion, who went to investigate together and heard the crying sound. They became suspicious and, the next afternoon, supervised the monks and soldiers to open the door for inspection. They saw broken doors, windows, and tables and chairs piled up in the room, with blood-like stains inside. They then dismantled part of the floor and found a torn piece of clothing, socks, and pants. At this point, their suspicions grew stronger and they immediately reported to the unit by telephone, inviting representatives from the county government's public security bureau to the camp for a joint inspection. They found that part of the land in the inner corner was quite loose and supervised the soldiers to excavate more than a foot, first discovering a face towel with faint blood stains and the markings "Changjing". There was also a handleless kitchen knife and a plane, both covered in rust, and several large and small bones. They immediately took photos of the items found for storage and drafted a proposal outlining five suspicious points in the case, requesting the superiors and the county government to investigate. They also set up a planchette at night to ask the name of the murderous monk and the truth of the case. It was later revealed that the deceased was a woman from Xia Zhuang Bridge, and people were sent to Xia Zhuang Bridge to inquire, and it turned out that there was such a person, and a woman had indeed disappeared several years ago, and so on. This is the situation of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Skeletal Remains Are Incomplete <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Yixing County Government believed that the case was bizarre and that it was not enough to serve as a warning without a thorough investigation. It immediately sent the bones, clothes, knife, etc. to the Academia Sinica in Shanghai for testing. However, the Academia Sinica was unable to handle the matter effectively due to insufficient equipment. On the 28th of last month, it was sent to this institute for testing. The number of bones sent was very small, and there were only seven or eight teeth, so this institute took the investigation very seriously. As for whether there is a victim and a murderer, this is not within the scope of this institute, so there is no answer. However, it will be determined whether the clothes, kitchen knife, plane, and lime are stained with human blood, whether the bones are human bones or miscellaneous bones, and how many years they have been buried. Although now</p>
<h3 id="e162">The Bones Have Been Examined <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Whether they are human or not, male or female, old or young, all the test results, before the case has been settled, I am not convenient to publish. The test report is now being prepared and will be released when it is transferred to the Jiangsu High Court. The completion date of the entire work is about the end of this month, because recently we are still</p>
<h3 id="e163">Testing the Blood Stains <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The testing procedure is very tight, because human blood must first be injected into the rabbit, and then reflect its original blood stains on the towel, whether it is human blood, animal blood, or other animal blood, a test can be clear. In short, this case still has no clues at present, and the truth is still unclear, and it is still difficult to determine whether the bones are human bones.</p>

<p>丨Pan Huizhu Granted Bail丨</p>
<p>Liu Chongwu and others, indignant that the general merchants in this city only know how to profit personally, sabotaging the boycott movement, and openly selling enemy goods, decided to deal with them by radical means. Since the recent month, they have followed in the footsteps of Yun Huifang, repeatedly throwing bombs or firing guns at the shops of treacherous merchants, causing tragic incidents of injury and death. The public concession police authorities believed that it was detrimental to security and ordered all police stations to investigate and arrest them. Liu and other twelve men and women were arrested one after another. The investigation has now been completed, and the Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Local Court based on the articles of law they violated. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Wenji publicly tried the case. Due to the serious nature of the case and the unusually complex content, it could not be investigated and clarified in a short period of time. Therefore, after the investigating officer reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants and the lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council made a statement, Judge Qian ordered an adjournment for continued trial next Wednesday afternoon. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Process of Arrest <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>At 2:30 p.m. on the 25th of last month, an assassination case suddenly occurred in house number 1040, Siwenli, Xinzha Road. One person, Wang Shouxi, was killed, and four people, including Cao Boqian, were injured. The murderer escaped from the scene. Afterwards, the Xinzha Police Station arrested two men and women, including Tang Zhangshi and Xu Runzhi, who were suspected of the case. The suspects confessed that the murderer, a tailor, was hiding at number 365, Hede Road. Inspector Zhao Bingkun and others went to arrest him, but the tailor had already fled. Inspector Zhao was afraid that he would return, so he waited there that day. At 6:30 p.m. on the 28th, Liu Chongwu entered from outside. Inspector Zhao felt that his actions were suspicious and arrested him. A loaded pistol was found on his body. He was then taken to the police station. At that time, a bombing case also occurred at the Deyuanchang Foreign Goods Store at number 567, Kangjiaqiao, Connaught Road. Police Officer Gu Xiang questioned him, and Liu immediately admitted that he had thrown the bomb. After repeated investigations, it was determined that although Liu had no connection with the assassination in Siwenli, he had participated in most of the cases in the concession where shops repeatedly selling Japanese goods received warning letters from a certain group, or were bombed, or even had shop employees injured by gunfire. He was immediately detained and, based on Liu's confession, the search began. On the morning of the 29th, Chinese and Western detectives went to the home of Pan Hongsheng at number 484, Guangdong Road, and arrested Pan. Later, Pan's younger sister, Huizhu, was also arrested. Huizhu led them to house number 40, Henan Road, where a loaded pistol was found. They then went to number 37, Wuhu Road, and arrested six Suzhou people, Cao Songshou, Tang Kang, Wu Ligang, Zhang Linxiang, Fan Xisheng, and Xu Weizu. Cao also confessed that a certain Gao, who lived at number 263, Tianjin Road, was also involved. When they went to arrest Gao, he had already fled, so they searched the house. Two pistols and some bullets were found on the roof. Cao also led the detectives back to his home and found a loaded pistol. Later, they went to number 13, Xingdeli, Laobeimen Street, and arrested Tian Shuiyang. On the 30th, detectives from the Huishi Police Station went to the Liangxi Hospital at number 728, Qipu Road, and seized letters related to the bombing case. They arrested the doctor of the hospital, Zhu Erkang from Wuxi. At the same time, Inspector Zhao arrested Hua Zhida from Wuxi at number 31, Xinzha Road. In three days, a total of twelve people were arrested, and five pistols, pistol bullets, rifle bullets, etc., were seized. Two of the guns were verified by the firearms inspection office as having been used.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Five People Released on Bail First <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Tang Shoukang, Wu Liyi, Zhang Linxiang, Fan Xisheng, and Xu Weizu, who were arrested, were repeatedly investigated by the officers in charge and found to have no connection with the cases. The lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this to the court last week, and they were allowed to be released on bail. The judge approved the release of the five people on bail, but they were not allowed to leave the area before the end of the trial and should be available for summons at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Seven People Indicted <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that Liu Chongkai and other seven people were involved in the shooting death of Wang Zhengtao, the manager of the Maotai Foreign Goods Store at numbers 310 and 312, Xinzha Road, on November 18, which was committed by Liu, Cao, Pan, Tian, and three others who are still at large. The bombing of the Maotai New Foreign Goods Store at number 499, Xinzha Road, on October 25, was committed by Cao and Tian. The attempted murder of Wang Yirong, the manager of the Yuyuanheng Foreign Goods Store at number 339, Yideli, Hankou Road, on November 24, was committed by Liu, Pan, and Cao. The bombing of the Sun Guangxing Watch Store at number 133, Henan Road, on October 24, which injured the employee Xie Bintai, was committed by Pan and Cao. From July 1 to 10, Jin Alai, the owner of the Jinyouji Leather Shop at numbers 20234, East and West Huade Road, was repeatedly threatened, which was committed by Zhu and Hua. In addition, the bombing of the Deyuanchang Foreign Goods Store was committed by Liu and Pan Hongsheng. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit based on the crimes committed by each person, charging them with murder, obstructing freedom, and endangering public safety under Articles 282 and 318 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Court Security <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Qian specially opened the Second Court for the trial of the case. The police authorities dispatched thirty to forty armed police officers from the reserve team to the First Special Court. Half of them were stationed outside the Second Court, and the rest were inside the court to assist the bailiffs and take care of everything in order to maintain order. Therefore, although the audience was very crowded, the situation was very serious.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Confessions of the Two Defendants <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>After the police lawyer stated the indictment and the investigating officer reported the investigation, Judge Qian questioned each defendant one by one about their age, occupation, and address. Defendant Pan Huizhu confessed that she led the detectives to search for the pistol and said that she saw her brother, Pan Hongsheng, interacting with people very closely, but she did not know what he was doing. Later, she accidentally found a package in the gap in the wall of her home. When she saw it, it was a pistol. She felt it was extremely dangerous and repeatedly tried to find a way to take it to the countryside and throw it away, but it was not convenient. Recently, she took advantage of the opportunity to take out the gun and hide it in the home of a female friend at number 40, Henan Road, intending to throw it away when it was convenient. Liu Chongwu requested to be released on bail and requested to be transferred to the court for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Pan Huizhu Released on Bail <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The police lawyer requested that the case be scheduled for a special trial because the situation was complicated. Since Pan Huizhu was a woman and her relationship to the case was relatively minor, it was also requested that she be allowed to be released on bail, and the case would be dealt with again during the continued trial. The court thought it was right, and the lawyers for the defendants, Chen Tingrui, Xue Jiaqi, Lu Dingkui, and Zou Shengzu, did not make any defenses because the case had to be postponed.

<p>▲The Cabin Was Full of Living Sheep Floating On the Sea</p>
<p>▲A Total of Eighty-Five Drowned</p>
<p>Xia Jilin, a person from Daishan, Dinghai, hired a Chongming boat from Yong, loaded with more than one hundred live sheep, intending to transport them to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday morning, when dawn was about to break, it arrived at the Sanshui Kou Stone Embankment of Wusong and was blown onto the stone embankment by a strong wind. At that time, the wind was strong and the waves were terrifying, causing the sheep boat to shatter, leaving only a few pieces of the ship's board. The cabin was full of living sheep floating on the sea, and eighty-five died. The passenger Xia and the four boatmen saw that the situation was not good and jumped onto the stone embankment, so they were unharmed, but the loss of the ship's cargo was already heavy. When the gale broke out the day before yesterday, the waves were so high that many ships sailing in the ocean were damaged by the wind. They are now being repaired on various beaches. There is also a flower boat that is leaking and cannot sail, so it is moored outside the port. Yesterday, a small steamer was hired to carry the flower clothing. It is said to be the goods of the Yong'an Yarn Factory. Also, a one-story house owned by a Li in Wusong Donghefeng Road was blown down by the gale. Fortunately, no one was in the house, so no one was injured.</p>

<p>▲ Fortunately, no one was killed</p>
<p>At approximately 5:15 PM yesterday, a workers' train departing from the Wusong Zhang Huabang Railway Factory of the Songhu Railway, while passing the Yangqi outside Xibaoxing Road near Tientong'an, stopped outside the Yangqi to wait to enter the station due to the blockage of Passenger Train No. 10 of the Jinghu Railway at the Shanghai Station. At this time, an upward passenger train (i.e., steam train) that departed from Paotaiwan at 4:25 PM for Shanghai arrived at Tientong'an Station. After obtaining the railway pass, it proceeded to Baoshan Road Station. Unexpectedly, while traveling near Xibaoxing Road, the driver did not notice that there was still a workers' train stopped in front. By the time he noticed, the train was too close to brake, resulting in a violent collision with the workers' train. The front of the steam train was damaged, and the driver was injured. The compartment at the back of the workers' train was also completely destroyed. Passengers inside the steam train fell from their seats into the carriage, suffering head injuries, arm injuries, and severe shocks. Fortunately, the train was moving very slowly, so no one was seriously injured. After the accident, the passengers disembarked on their own and left. The reporter was also on board the steam train coming from Songhu to Shanghai. Because I was sitting in the last carriage, my head was slightly injured during the collision. After the accident, Inspector Chen Faxiang reported the incident to the main station and requested instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Continued Hearing of the Case Against Flood Relief Association Officials - The Case of Quan Shaowu <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The issue of suspension of relief causes further complications; proceedings are temporarily suspended pending investigation of evidence.</p>
<p>Flood Relief Association officials Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, Wang Fanwu, and Zha Liangzhao were accused by the Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai to the First Special District Local Court for handling flood relief in northern Anhui. The details of the multiple trials have been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Ting_ once again summoned both parties and witnesses for a continued hearing. However, the first accusation against the second defendant Quan Shaowu, regarding the suspension of emergency relief in Wuhe County, has not been concluded after two hearings. Therefore, the hearing focused on this accusation first. Quan Shaowu's lawyer stated that the plaintiff claimed that the defendant suspended emergency relief in Wuhe for fifteen days, from May 26 to June 9. The defendant had already submitted the stub of the relief ticket from May 29, proving that relief was not suspended. Yesterday, they submitted eleven booklets of ticket stubs from several days before and after May 29, which further proves that relief was not suspended. Judge Wu examined each of the submitted ticket stubs and noticed that the numbers were not consecutive between books. He then questioned Quan Shaowu in detail about the procedures for inspecting and distributing relief, as well as the reason for the discrepancy in ticket numbers. Quan explained each point and stated that this was a matter of procedure, and that these ticket stubs had already been reviewed twice. If there were any inaccuracies, the reviewing body would have reported them to the Flood Relief Association. Since there were no objections from the reviewers, it shows that there were no irregularities. Furthermore, the plaintiff is accusing the defendant of suspending relief; he requested that the hearing investigate whether relief was actually suspended. The plaintiff's representative, Li Zhenya, and the chairman of the Wuhe Relief Branch, Chen Shuizhen, successively refuted Quan's explanation of the relief distribution procedures and the non-consecutive ticket numbers. The plaintiff's lawyer also presented official documents from the Wuhe County government and sworn statements from several flood victims in Wuhe, all firmly stating that not only was there no relief distribution on May 29, but no relief committee members visited in the three days before or after May 29, so there was no relief distribution. Quan Shaowu argued that the distribution on May 29 was in cash, which was distributed by He Bingheng, sent by the Anhui Northern United Committee, and did not go through the local relief branch or the county government. The court pointed out that relief distribution must involve local personnel, so they questioned Quan about who distributed the cash. Quan replied that only He Bingheng knew this, but the relief tickets were still stored in Bengbu and could be inspected. The plaintiff's lawyer then presented the minutes of the Wuhe Relief Branch meeting, stating that at 9:00 PM on June 2, the relief branch invited the county magistrate, party committee, and chairman of the Chamber of Commerce to a meeting, and He Bingheng was also present. The minutes stated that He reported on the spot that he had brought 4,000 yuan in cash. Based on this, the earliest relief distribution would have started on June 3. However, Quan's lawyer also presented the Flood Relief Association's disbursement report, proving that the 11,000 yuan in relief funds for Wuhe had already been fully disbursed. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer claimed that Wuhe only received 5,000 yuan, and the remaining 6,000 yuan was still missing, and that the plaintiff would need to add accusations against the defendant. This led to another complication, and the investigation into the suspension of relief could not continue. The court ordered a halt to the proceedings on this accusation and ordered further investigation of the evidence before resuming the hearing. The hearing then proceeded to the second accusation against Quan Shaowu, regarding the withholding of 75 tons of relief wheat from Xuyi County. According to Tan Shaohua, a relief committee member from Xuyi, the county was supposed to receive 300 tons of relief wheat, but only received 150 tons of relief wheat and the value of 75 tons of wheat, leaving a shortage of 75 tons. Although they had received the bill of lading, the wheat could not be retrieved. He presented the bill of lading as evidence. Quan Shaowu stated that the county was supposed to receive 300 tons, which had already been fully disbursed. He presented evidence such as the receipt issued by Xuyi County Magistrate Wang Xinlan. Both sides held to their own accounts and had substantial evidence. After repeated inquiries by Judge Wu, it was revealed that the 75 tons of relief wheat from the county had been collected in Mingguang by a Mr. Wang, because there was a guarantee from the local Chamber of Commerce, so the bill of lading was not collected. Furthermore, Tan Shaohua was aware of this matter and had written a letter to him. After the court presented the letter to Tan for review, he insisted that it was not his handwriting and requested to write a sample on the spot for comparison. However, it was late, and Judge Wu ordered the hearing to be postponed to another day.</p>

<h3 id="e178">National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Requests the Formulation of a Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the Nanjing National Government stating that they had received a letter from the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce which roughly stated: "Upon investigation, the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax of the Republic of China, drafted and promulgated by the former Ministry of Finance, are largely incomplete. At the time, because the Stamp Tax Law had not yet been formulated, the regulations were temporarily used as a substitute for the law to serve as a transition. However, since it is named 'provisional,' it implies temporary measures and should not be implemented for many years. Although stamp tax bureaus in various provinces and regions take advantage of the incompleteness of the law to facilitate fines, the original intention of legislation was to protect the rights of various deeds and personal certificates. It is not appropriate to deliberately set traps to trick people into them. Moreover, without clear written regulations, those with power have the advantage in determining right and wrong, and ordinary people have no recourse. Now, we list the points of extreme pain in the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations. In addition to the original text being on file and avoiding redundant narratives, we conclude by stating that since the capital of Beiping moved south, the market has become increasingly depressed, and corruption has become increasingly rampant. Thinking of this, we cannot help but shed tears. We earnestly request your association to forward this to the authorities and approve the request to address the points of pain mentioned above. First, provincial and municipal stamp tax bureaus should not arbitrarily impose fines. Urgently formulate a Stamp Tax Law, etc." Based on this, upon investigation, the incomplete clauses of the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations give unscrupulous officials the opportunity to seek personal gain and arbitrarily impose harsh fines. The association has previously received complaints from chambers of commerce in various provinces, counties, and cities, and the accumulated cases are voluminous, truly a source of widespread resentment. We have repeatedly telegraphed requests for the formulation of a Stamp Tax Law. Based on the letter above, we hereby telegraphically report to your government and departments for verification and approval. We earnestly request that you promptly order the Legislative Yuan to formulate a Stamp Tax Law and urge that provincial, county, and municipal stamp taxes not be arbitrarily imposed before the Stamp Tax Law is formulated, in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We sincerely hope for this. Chairman Lin of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Kanghou, respectfully submits this petition with a seal.</p>

<p>A letter from Mr. Wang Zixin: "...I graduated from high school at the age of twenty-one. My grades in school were very good in all subjects. The teachers all said that I was a promising young man, and I myself felt that my future was bright. After graduation, because of family financial difficulties, I could not go to college. I was not disappointed, because I always thought that even if I could not go to college, I could find a suitable job by relying on myself. Sure enough, I relied on my pen to get into a certain company. The manager saw that my articles and handwriting were very good, so he assigned me to manage the documents. I was very happy to learn this, because I thought that this was my strength; because when I was in school, I often contributed to publications and served as the editor of the school newspaper for a year. The writing in this store is certainly easier. Unexpectedly, I ran into a snag the first time, which made me extremely discouraged...The company launched a new product, and I had to register the trademark with the Trademark Bureau, so I drafted an official document. Unexpectedly, when the manager saw it, he sneered and said, 'I don't need you to write an essay!' I immediately felt a chill, thinking, 'Isn't this writing an essay?' But I didn't dare to say it out loud...After listening to the manager's words, I flipped through the old drafts and couldn't help but feel discouraged...When I was in school, I got 98 points for writing an invitation to a friend to appreciate chrysanthemums, but now it's not like that at all! Sir, is everything I learned in the past completely useless to me? Were the praises of the teachers in the past all lies? Is it the school's fault, the teacher's fault, or my own fault? Who should be responsible for this mistake? Is there a way to remedy it? I think there must be many people who have the same difficulties as me. Sir, I hope you will be a beacon for our future!" Reply: "Your feet are unrestrained and free, your aspirations are extraordinary, and I am very impressed. The questions you asked can be summarized into two points..."</p>
<p>"What you have learned is not what you are using now." This saying has become a common catchphrase. For example, after becoming an engineering expert, one becomes a professor. This is all because society cannot use it, or even if it can, what he has learned may not be applicable. But your situation cannot be classified into this category. What the school teaches is principles and common sense. It can teach people rules but cannot teach people how to adapt. The things in the world are endless...learn one and infer a hundred. Education has done its best...it depends on the scholar's ability to use what he knows to adapt to things...There is absolutely no rigid article in the world. You are only twenty-one years old and have graduated from high school, so your talent is undoubted. Based on your excellent grades in school, even though you have some difficulties now, you will soon be able to overcome them, so there is no need to be "discouraged." The success of any career must go through some difficulties. The more eager you are to make progress, the greater the difficulties you will encounter, and the more discouraged you will become...This must rely on perseverance to overcome. If you are discouraged by a small setback, you will never be able to achieve great things. You are very confident and have great ambitions, but you were made to "feel a chill" by the manager's laughter. Isn't that cowardly? In the future, there may be things that make you feel a chill from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet, which is our young people's "deeply rooted and intertwined" problems. Moreover, the manager did not laugh coldly and immediately order you to leave, but instead asked you to refer to the old drafts. This is an opportunity to make rapid progress. How can you miss it? Furthermore, the difference in this kind of written text lies in the format, but the reasoning is the same as writing in school...What you have learned in the past is the foundation and cannot be abandoned rashly. If you bravely move forward, the light will not be far away.</p>
<p>Notice: Recently, there have been too many letters from various parties, and the review is more complicated, so the response time may be sooner or later. Letter-writers, please forgive me. In short, this column will answer all letters with complete procedures, but the time will vary.</p>
<p>He is a British officer who has been serving as a dispatch officer in the Shanghai Commercial Corps for three years. He is now returning home to serve in his original unit. Mr. Chung, Director-General of the Municipal Council, sent a letter on behalf of the board of directors to Mr. _. The letter roughly stated: "With the permission of the British government, you have served diligently and made outstanding contributions. During the turmoil in this port this spring, you were able to handle matters properly, ensuring that all members of the Commercial Corps, regardless of their nationality, had no complaints. We are particularly grateful for this. Because of your military's request, we have no choice but to allow you to return to your unit. Your future prospects are boundless."</p>

<p>▲ Because she had more than forty yuan hidden on her person</p>
<p>▲ Which melted into two silver blocks</p>
<p>The toy sulfur ammunition workshop at No. 4 Ronghua Lane, Fangbang Millu Road, French Concession, caught fire at 0:20 PM the day before yesterday, spreading to neighboring houses and burning a worker to death. The fire brigade pulled out the body and sent it to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall to wait for an autopsy. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the deceased was indeed Duan Zhang, a 31-year-old female worker from Huzhou who lived at No. 1 Yongshou Lane, Fangbang Road, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Her daughter and others knew that the deceased had more than forty yuan hidden on her body. The coroner found two melted silver blocks in front of the deceased's chest, which proved this. Yesterday morning, the patrol room reported to the Second Special District Court, which sent Prosecutor Deng Baosun to the site to verify that the deceased was indeed burned to death before her death. According to the information provided by the foreman, the official ordered that the body be allowed to be claimed by the deceased's son, Duan Zhengming, after signing a guarantee. The deceased had one son and five daughters, all of whom were young. The deceased was a Christian before her death, so the Jesus Church sent personnel to the scene to prepare a coffin and claim the body. The deceased's children will also be taken care of by the church. 1</p>

<p>▲ Forgotten on a rickshaw in the French Concession</p>
<p>▲ A reward of twenty-five yuan will be given for the return of the original items.</p>
<p>A Russian professor and traveler named Captain N. Diakoff, currently residing at No. 70, Route Cardinal Mercier, French Concession, went to a school on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon, and then took a rickshaw back to his residence in the French Concession. After getting off the rickshaw, he went straight into his residence and forgot a large leather bag on the rickshaw. Inside was a large map of various regions of China, hundreds of drawings, hundreds of letters of introduction with inscriptions from people in various regions, educational halls, and important government officials, and 200 map orders. These items are the result of Diakoff's decades of travel and painstaking efforts in various parts of China. Once lost, he almost wanted to commit suicide. In addition, there was a passport issued by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, a passport for American Philippine territory, and a passport for French Annam territory. Because of the loss of the above items, Mr. Diakoff originally intended to take a ship to the Philippines today, but he is now unable to do so. We hope that benevolent people will consider that the above items are of little value to others, but Mr. Diakoff regards them as treasures. Please return the original items to Mr. Diakoff at No. 70, Route Cardinal Mercier, French Concession, and he will reward you with twenty-five yuan.</p>

<p>To the editor, I am writing to you because your newspaper today published a news item about the Liaojihei Re Yi Yong Army Transportation Corps, which is not in accordance with the facts. After the team stopped its activities, comrades Liu Ying (namely Tianxiong) once introduced the team leader Zheng Jianbo and Xie Zhong to me, and there were words of support and praise. But I stand on the anti-Japanese stance, and I was purely and without other reasons willing to give support and praise. However, I did not give guidance or reorganization to the team, nor did I order it to be renamed the Liaojihei Re Yi Yong Army Transportation Corps. I am afraid that the rumors are not true, so I hereby send a special letter, please correct it in your newspaper, I wish you well, Yan Bowei, December 13.</p>

<p>㈡㈡ Phoneme practice should be analyzed only to the smallest practical unit to avoid too much analysis, which is not practical and wastes effort.</p>
<p>㈡㈢ In the practice of listening and pronouncing sounds, make full use of the aids in speech, such as the recognition and reading of phonetic symbols, the observation of pronunciation positions, etc., to make it easier for students to grasp.</p>
<p>㈡㈣ Pay attention to the comprehensive changes in the phonemes that should be in words and sentences, such as assimilation, connection, etc., to make them fit the situation of living language.</p>
<p>㈡㈤ The sequence of work should be from reading aloud to so that it can be</p>
<p>use and is easier to increase the speed of reading.</p>

<p>The Wusong Fisheries School, in order to practically test fish farming techniques, has an attached fish farm in Kunshan. Since the January 28th Incident, the farm's finances have been severely strained, but it has striven to maintain operations without faltering. Recently, observing that the fish farming methods of the local villagers were conservative and invariably led to failure, the school, in addition to compiling and printing "A Simple Explanation of Fish Farming" research reports for distribution and publicity, has established a guidance center to answer inquiries from all sectors. Since its establishment, numerous letters requesting guidance have been received from nearby land reclamation companies, the Kunshan County Education Bureau, the Zhejiang Provincial Experimental Farm, and the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, among others.</p>

John's launched a steady attack, and the momentum was favorable. Shanghai University followed closely behind, maintaining control but without a chance to surpass. In the first half, John's led 16-8, with a four-goal lead. Starting in the second half, Shanghai University took the offensive and seized the initiative. For a moment, their momentum was overwhelming, and they suddenly exceeded the score, taking an 18-16 lead over John's. In this tense atmosphere, John's intensified its efforts and slowly progressed. The "Little Five Warriors" each showed their drive, with each point breaking through. Everyone raced to claim credit. On the scoreboard, the score was reversed and exceeded. From then on, Shanghai University was once again at a disadvantage and struggled to break free, without building any momentum. John's had smooth sailing and won 32-19, winning the championship.

Zhijiang was no match for Jinling. In the first half, Jinling scored 22 points, while Zhijiang only scored 9 points. In the second half, the situation was more intense. Both sides had lax defense, and there were great opportunities. As a result, the final score was 56-29, with Jinling winning. Jinling therefore won the right to compete for the runner-up.</p>

<p>▲Shanghai University Loses to Jinling in the Runner-Up Final: Shanghai University Middle School, which failed in the basketball championship final, and Jinling Middle School, which won the loser's bracket final, competed for the runner-up title in the afternoon. Both sides’ players had not recovered their energy after the morning’s games. Their desperate struggles were lacking in spirit, so the situation was more relaxed, and the excitement was reduced. In the first half, Shanghai University won 20-16. At the start of the second half, Jinling scored two consecutive goals, bringing the score to a tie of 20-20. Shanghai University continued to work hard and once again exceeded the score. After this, Jinling's lineup was scattered, and their offense and defense were weak, with little to show for it. Shanghai University repeatedly scored goals, and the records increased repeatedly. As a result, the score was 40-28, and Shanghai University won the runner-up.</p>

<p>▲...Shanghai University Defeats Qingguang...</p>
<p>丨Sending New Opportunities···▲</p>
<p>The YMCA basketball tournament created a new landscape last night. The winning army, the Pirates, suffered a major defeat at the hands of the McLaines, 44-32. The Pirates’ defeat also created an opportunity for Shanghai University. The match was fast-paced and exciting to watch. In another match, Qingguang lost to Shanghai University 50-42. Shanghai University showed much more improvement than when they lost to Nanxing. There are no matches tonight.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Opportunity for Shanghai University <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Pirates' defeat created a great opportunity for Shanghai University. From now on, the Pirates, Shanghai University, McLaine, and Xiaguang have each lost once. If the two Zhonghua teams can continue to maintain their victories and strive hard, their prospects are limitless.</p>
<h3 id="e213">McLaine Shows Their Colors <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The McLaines showed their colors last night. The fierceness and strength of their defense prevented the Pirates' forwards from developing. Their forwards were swift and nimble, as if flying. The ball pierced the net quickly. Sullivan and Pilai, though lying in wait like tigers, could only wait. Center Qinboer and left forward Liar cooperated well. Although the Pirates replaced Sanat with Sullivan in the second half, they were still unable to stop Qinboer. When Qinboer was injured in the foot and left during the second half, Bishopo replaced him as center, and their momentum did not diminish at all.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Pirates Without Life <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The Pirates immediately trailed the McLaines 4-13 when they took the field. Although they tried their best to resist, they were still ten points behind at 9-19. Later, taking advantage of the opportunity for penalty shots, the Pirates were still six points behind at 15-21 in the first half. The McLaines controlled the situation, and the Pirates were flustered. Their poor shooting was out of the ordinary. Shi Guiya only scored one goal in the whole game, and Smith was also often off by a fraction. In the second half, when the Pirates caught up to within five or six points, the McLaines took the lead again. In the end, the McLaines played better and better, and the Pirates suffered an irreversible defeat. Of the 32 points, 10 points were scored by Hill from penalty shots. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Li Zuqi.▲McLaine Fouls and Points▲Pirates Fouls and PointsKaiden (Forward) 0 Fouls, 2 PointsDa Shi Guiya (Forward) 1 Foul, 2 PointsBailang (Forward) 1 Foul, 0 PointsSmith (Forward) 0 Fouls, 8 PointsMaolai (Forward) 2 Fouls, 13 PointsNorris (Forward) 0 Fouls, 0 PointsMonaghan (Forward) 0 Fouls, 1 PointHill (Forward) 0 Fouls, 16 PointsQinbo (Forward) 1 Foul, 12 PointsPilai (Guard) 2 Fouls, 2 PointsHalitai (Forward) 2 Fouls, 2 PointsLifu (Guard) 0 Fouls, 2 PointsSullivan (Guard) 3 Fouls, 2 PointsBainaite (Guard) 1 Foul, 2 PointsBishopo (Guard) 3 Fouls, 12 PointsTotal 7 Fouls, 32 PointsTotal 10 Fouls, 44 PointsFirst half: McLaine 21 points, Pirates 15 pointsSecond half: McLaine 23 points, Pirates 17 pointsShanghai University Defeats Qingguang</p>

<p>Shanghai University's performance last night was greatly improved. They won a complete victory over Qingguang with a score of 7-0 when they took the field. Qingguang struggled to catch up and was behind by only three points. As the first half was about to end, Shanghai University scored two consecutive goals, winning the first half 32-29.</p>

<p>Starting in the second half, Shanghai University's momentum increased even more. The difference in scores was the largest, with as many as 17 points. Although Lin Ze repeatedly broke through from the backfield, due to excessive point loss, they were unable to reverse the victory. Qingguang lost to Shanghai University 50-42 at the end of the game.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Middle School Sports Federation’s annual football competition, which began several weeks ago, has been going on for several weeks. The teams that have won the right to compete in the finals are Shanghai University High School in the Upper Group and Pudong Middle School in the Sea Group. According to the schedule, the two sides were scheduled to hold the final today afternoon. However, since the Shanghai University High School has been participating in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Sports Federation of China organized by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Province, in reality it is difficult to divide time. Therefore, it requested the Middle School Football Committee to reschedule the final scheduled for today. The Football Committee believes that the Shanghai University request is not without reason, so it has agreed with Pudong Middle School and decided to change the date to Friday afternoon (December 23rd) at 3 PM at the China Football Field.

<h3 id="e228">Financial and Gold Market Surge <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>(Soaring by 8.4 Taels) Yesterday's market continued to reach a peak, with a firm and buoyant state. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets was only four to five taels. Ultimately, it surged by 8.4 taels. The initial rise was mainly due to the continued decline in the silver market. Although exchange rates and American cotton rose, they did not have a significant impact. Later, due to the tense trend in foreign exchange, buyers on the floor were active, and the market improved further. The fluctuations in between were only around two taels. The afternoon market was particularly sharp, already exceeding the 810 tael mark. The Central Bank opened and injected 105 bars of spot gold in the morning at a price of 807 taels and 5 qian, which was sold by Tong Feng Heng. Furthermore, the short seller Heng Xing bought more than 100 bars of December gold from the long sellers Qian Chang Xiang, etc., with a discount of 4 qian, which was lower than last week, because the spot inventory seemed to be increasing.</p>
<p>(Morning Market Showing Promise) From the early opening of the January contract, it immediately rose by 1.6 qian, to 803 taels and 2 qian, followed by fluctuations of four to five qian, reaching 803 taels. Because Hua Bi absorbed 6,875 pounds of January English gold, and the Japanese bank bought 25 US dollars for March, and Yuan Xing Yong, Nei Xing, Da Xing Yong, etc. bought in, it immediately added more than 2 taels, to 805 taels and 7 qian. Fu Yu, Tian Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan Tai, and some speculators sold off, and the March US $25 could be done at 28 yuan for December, so the price fell back more than 1 tael, to 804 taels. Soon, Heng Yu, He Yuan Tai, Hong Kang Yong, and zero-lot buyers competed to buy. Both the HSBC listed exchange rates for English and American currencies shrank by 125, and Mitsui absorbed 125 US dollars for March, and 28 yuan could be sold for December, so at 9:30 it was 807 taels. In the blink of an eye, the exchange rates of English and American currencies shrank again by 125. Unfortunately, the price of gold did not improve, because the previous market was already done by people. At this time, it stood at more than 806 taels. Then, Feng, Yong Fu Tai, Tian Feng, Yong Zhao Feng Chang, etc. sold some, and HSBC, etc. sold 125 US dollars for February to Mitsui, and the price of gold fell by more than 1 tael, until 10:30 it was 805 taels and 1 qian. Hu Chang, Yuan Heng, Fu Yu, Fu Tai, Heng Yuan Tai, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. came to buy, and Hua Bi absorbed 28 yuan for January, and Mitsui absorbed 1,875 for March, so it rose again by 3 taels. At 11:00 it was 808 taels. After entering, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Ji Yong, and retail long positions took the opportunity to sell, sharply falling by 2 taels. At 11:30 it was 806 taels and 2 qian. Suddenly, Tong Feng Heng sold 105 bars of spot gold to the Central Bank, causing the price to rise by more than 1 tael, and Yi Feng and Da De Cheng, etc. followed up. At 11:50 it was 807 taels and 8 qian. The noon closing was 807 taels and 4 qian.</p>
<p>(Soaring to 812 Taels After the Closing) The afternoon market opened at 808 taels. Later, because Zhi Feng Yong, Wan Xing Shun Li, etc. sold out, it fell back to 807 taels. Mai Hang offered 1,875 US dollars for March. Then Hua Bi absorbed 9,375 for December, and January was settled at the same price. Furthermore, Bing Xing, Heng Xing, Da Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, etc. had a strong buying intention, and Fu Yu was particularly determined to drag in. The market situation became more and more sharp, rising by 4 taels, and there were few positions left. At 2:45 it was 811 taels. Then Zhao Feng Chang, Feng Yong Shun Li, Yong Feng Heng Yu, etc. took this opportunity to sell, but US dollars were settled very actively, and banks were still willing to buy, so the price of gold could not rise any further, but fell by 2.5 taels. At 4:00 it was 808 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, it seemed to be looking up. Heng Xing bought in on behalf of a certain bank, and Hong Xing, Sen Chang Yong, and Wu Pin, etc. bought in, causing the price to rise back by 1.5 taels. From 4:00 to 4:30 the fluctuations were only a few qian. Then it closed at 810 taels, up 8.4 taels compared to the previous day. After the closing, it suddenly rose again by 2 taels, reaching 812 taels. However, buyers were not happy. The downstream price was about 811 taels. According to the full day, the highest price was 811 taels, and the lowest price was 803 taels, a difference of 8 taels. The discount for bare gold decreased because the supply was constant, adding only 10 taels and 5 qian. The initial listed price for US dollars decreased by 125, so it was calculated as 861 taels with a discount of 54.5 taels. Soon it was changed to a reduction of 125 and also changed to 865 taels, with a discount of 60 taels to 57.8 taels. In the afternoon, it was 57 taels to 58 taels, and then 54.5 taels. Compared with the previous day, there was no significant difference. The charge was 800 taels to 807 taels, the additional charge was 807 taels, and 810 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Active Trading at Various Firms) Trading on the floor was still active. It is estimated that Ren De Cheng, Wan Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, and Tong Feng Heng all bought in, and Yuan Mao Yong, Tian Feng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Yong, Fu Yu, and Shun Li all sold. Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, Bing Xing, Chang Xiang, etc. were busy buying and selling. Heng Yu was both buying and selling, which was even more complicated. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Da Xing Yong, Fu Yu, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Mao, and Fu Chang all bought in, and Yuan Mao Yong, Yong Feng, Zhao Feng Chang, Wan Xing, Chang Yong, Shun Li, and Yi Feng Yong all sold out. The rest was complicated. The Dalian group sold a total of about 1,000 bars and bought 500 to 600 bars. The Ningbo group was still in the minority. The number of bars in each firm was about 19,000.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Tightening Concurrently</p>
<h3 id="e229">Listed Exchange Rates Shrinking Twice, Full Day Trading Very Lively <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to fall, and the forward prices also decreased. However, exchange rates did indeed rise again, but the amount was limited, estimated at 125 to 75. As for the local exchange notes, both the official and unofficial rates were tight, especially for English gold. The initial listed rate by HSBC shrank by half a grade, estimated at 125 for both English and American currencies. Soon it was changed to shrink by half a grade, and English and American currencies continued to shrink by 125. The other exchange rates were also more expensive twice. Only Hong Kong was still 77 taels, which was probably the bank's actual opening price. The English gold price was good at the beginning, and then became firmer. The afternoon was calm. As a result, it shrank by 1.875 compared to the previous day. The American gold price was flat in the morning and then became firmer, with slight fluctuations. The afternoon market stabilized. The total shrinkage was estimated at 25. However, the price of gold was still sharp and had broken through the 810 tael mark, so the arbitrage spread was slightly larger. Therefore, the gold firms all had transactions, with tens of thousands of pounds of English gold traded, and the receipts and payments were uneven. Sassoon sold this month's and American dollars totaling about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The morning market was initially sold and then picked up, and the afternoon market was particularly keen to settle. Many banks were doing business with each other. Hua Bi advanced and then withdrew. Old Citibank and HSBC mostly sold their positions. Sassoon Yang Hang sold the February contract. The total transaction prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>The English Exchange internal rate had a difference of 125 throughout the day. From the opening price in the morning, December and January were 1 shilling 8 pence 6875, February 75, and March 8125. Hua Bi ate January 6875 and then 125 5625. Sassoon entered the noon closing at 8 pence 5625 to 6875 with an advance price of 625 to 75. In the afternoon, Datong and Korea mutually traded January 875. Shanghai offered February 625. The closing price was the same as the noon closing.</p>
<p>(American Exchange) The internal rate fluctuated up and down by 25 in the morning and afternoon. From the early opening price, December was 28 yuan 125, January 1875, February 3125, March 375.

Also, one US dollar was initially worth 3 taels 5 qian 8 fen 744, and later 3 taels 6 qian 036.</p>

The cash market was extremely sluggish, with only 7,000 yuan opened. The market sentiment was cold, large investors did not move, and the market was idle. For example, the unified salt tax only fluctuated by a few jiao. As a result, it was generally slightly weaker than the previous day, with the amount being only a few jiao. However, the customs tax, financial long-term, and second customs slightly increased, and the financial short-term was slightly 2 yuan and 3 jiao. Regarding the bond market situation, it seems unlikely to develop easily for the time being, as the end of the year is approaching.

<p>Xin Feng Yang Hang reported that on Monday (12th), the New York stock market was no longer dominated by war debt issues. There were very few sellers, and the market sentiment was relatively stable, so the shorts immediately covered their positions. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the 10th. The exchange rate market was difficult to grasp. The franc once fell to a new low, but rebounded before closing. The total number of transactions for the day was 920,000 shares.

<p>丨Some Manufacturers Sell Forward Contracts丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market conditions were slightly flat and weak, and the trend softened again because customer demand was clearer than yesterday. According to some, because the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is difficult for the financial situation of various groups to be very affluent. There were deep fears that they would still not have the ability to actively purchase, so the market sentiment weakened slightly, and some yarn factories sold in the distant months, making the market more turbulent. In short, if actual sales can continue uninterrupted, the market price can be expected to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Man Biao (Cotton Exchange) Flat and Weak <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the Man Biao market, the remaining momentum of customer sales from the previous day was very strong. Some short positions covered, and the market sentiment was relatively firm. The rising momentum in the second session was even more intense. Later, as factories sold, the market sentiment turned weak. As a result, the price of each month rose by two, three, four, and five qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the actual demand was clearer, and the market sentiment softened again. The price of each month fell by two, four, five, six, and eight qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,600 bales. It was found that Rui Da sold 1,550 bales, Feng sold 1,000 bales, Ji Feng sold 700 bales, Ji sold 800 bales, and Chang Feng sold 2,000 bales.

<p>▲Delivery Period is Near, Factories Dump Without Sufficient Delivery Volume▲</p>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the situation was still firm. The price of gold was also high, and American cotton also showed a stable situation. Moreover, as the delivery period for this month is approaching, a certain manufacturer has shorted more than 40,000 dan. According to partial investigations, there may not be such a volume for delivery, so the buyers' sentiment is good. However, the current cotton on the market and factory prices have not been very smooth.</p>

<p>▲Dalian Gang Collects, Floating Long Positions Rush In▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month were generally stable. Since the price of foreign wheat fell by about 1 to 2 jiao, the market sentiment was still flat at the beginning. However, as various factories entered the market and outside merchants continued to buy, and merchants from Dong Province also slightly increased their purchases, the market sentiment gradually became firmer. When the market opened in the afternoon, the prices of each month rose again in unison, especially the rise in January was even more frantic. Since there was some short covering in this month and the market sentiment was already tight, the Dalian Gang tried their best to buy, and general floating long positions also joined in to rush in. Therefore, the price rose step by step with a very strong momentum. In particular, it was also rumored that Fuxin did not have much raw materials and would stop production, which made the market sentiment even better. However, Fufeng had some sellers in January, and Fuxin also slightly sold in the forward term, but the amount was small. The subsequent trend will depend on whether the Dalian Gang will continue to move and then determine the rise and fall. As a result, this month rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, January rose by 4 fen, February and March rose by 1.5 fen, April rose by 1.75 fen, and May rose by 2 fen.</p>

<p>丨Few Chips, Transactions Still Sparse丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon still showed signs of stability and buoyancy for each month. Although the price of foreign wheat was slightly lower by 1 to 2 jiao, the exchange rate shrank again, which inevitably affected the pricing of wheat. This kind of imagination was entirely based on temporary emotional considerations. Since the foreign wheat already ordered by the factories in this port is sufficient for use until the new wheat next year, they are slightly panicked because they cannot continue to receive it. Moreover, due to the re-buoyancy of the flour market, the market sentiment is inevitably rising, but transactions are still sparse, mainly because the chips are not abundant. As a result, February rose by 4 fen compared to the previous day, March rose by 3 fen, April rose by 2 fen, and there were no other changes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer xian became increasingly popular, but the market inventory was already around 40,000 bags. Firms were afraid of affecting the market and did not release samples or announce the arrival volume, so the arrival number was unknown. However, some lenders, in view of the arrival of many river rice boats and the decline in prices after the sale became sluggish, and a large amount of foreign wheat existed, were more willing to devalue and sell in order to seek economic circulation. Except for the Xiang machine red rice, which was in short supply and actively sold, allowing the market to support, other rice depreciated slightly by 1 jiao. The price decline slightly caused inquiries from various Min province groups. The Northern gang also tried to handle hundreds of bags, mostly for the Min province capital gangs. It was reported that 827 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were priced at 8 yuan, and 142 bags of machine early rice were priced at 7 yuan 8 jiao half. 1,500 bags of Hunan machine red rice were priced at 8 yuan 7 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen to 7 yuan 9 jiao. Also, 380 bags of red rice were priced at 6 yuan half. 900 bags of Wuhu machine yuan were priced at 9 yuan to 8 yuan 7 or 8 jiao. 384 bags of Anqing yuan were priced at 8 yuan to 7 yuan 9 jiao.</p>

<p>Last week, the market for raw peanuts saw lively inflows and outflows again. However, the quality of the goods varied, so the prices varied. High-quality goods generally rose.

<p>Qingdao Newsletter. Hulled peanuts are being absorbed by East and West Ocean companies at the local level. Because high-quality goods are scarce, they are turning to ordinary goods. The previous market price was 6 yuan 7 or 8 jiao, and the current release price is 7 yuan 1 jiao, which is being heavily purchased. The next grade is 7 yuan, and the next grade is 6 yuan 6 or 7 jiao, and the lowest grade is 6 yuan 4 or 5 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's overseas sugar market reports indicated no changes in New York spot prices. Futures for December, May, and September also remained unchanged. Only the futures for January, March, and July saw a slight increase of about one pound. London futures for December and May both decreased slightly by one pence and seventeen and a half points, while March decreased by one pence and ten points. Java white sugar also remained unchanged. Locally, Shanghai's sugar market saw the benchmark price rise further to over 800 taels, and the momentum tightened again. In the morning, Changxing Trading Company offered 1,000 bags of No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at a price of 15 taels and 4 mace, already showing signs of an increase. In the afternoon, the guild's trading session maintained a positive atmosphere, with more buying than selling, pushing prices up another 2.5 fen to 15 taels, 4 mace, and 2.5 fen. Later in the session, prices reached 15 taels and 4 mace and 5 fen, an improvement of 6.25 li compared to the day before. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was traded in small lots at 14 taels and 7 mace to 7 mace and 5 fen. No. 18 medium granulated white sugar remained stable at 14 taels and 4 mace.

<p>Longkou vermicelli supply has recently surged, with customer bids once reaching as low as 18 taels. In recent days, prices have gradually improved, and yesterday's opening price tightened further, rising to 18.5 taels. Most of the goods have already been purchased by various firms, and with the winter sales season approaching, demand is expected to be strong, so the firms have been raising their asking prices, and there is a potential for further price increases. According to telegrams from the production area, the price per package is 24 taels and 9 qian, and the market is expected to rise further.</p>

<p>Raw silk sales have shown renewed vigor. American silk factories have a strong demand for goods, as they are currently weaving spring silk. Therefore, the price of American silk has been increasing daily. Due to the continuous strong sales in recent days, Chinese merchants are holding onto their silk stocks, waiting for better prices before selling, resulting in price increases of around 50 taels in the past ten days. Most transactions involve standard silk. French silk only accounts for a hundred or so pieces of Sichuan silk.</p>

<p>Since the order regarding Xiutong oil, existing stocks have been sold out, and there have been no transactions for a long time. Recently, however, several hundred barrels of Wan Yu, Dayou Heng, and other brands have arrived, and the customer has come to Shanghai to discuss opening customer bids with local firms. Bids were announced the day before yesterday, with prices for Wan Yu and Dayou Heng set at 23 taels and 4 qian, and prices for Xia Taiheng and Jifeng Heng set at 22 taels and 6 qian. These are all customer bids, totaling a thousand pieces, which have been distributed to various oil and sesame firms.

<p>丨Jodhpur Cloth and Real Horse Lining丨</p>
<p>"Jodhpur cloth" is currently experiencing an extreme shortage, with sales surging, supplies interrupted, and market inventories greatly depleted. Prices are increasing steadily. Yesterday, a 1005 quality cloth was being hoarded by sellers, asking for 67 taels. Tailors selling remnants were asking for 10 yuan and 5 jiao per yard. "Real horse lining" is also extremely scarce, with prices up several points from last week. Yesterday, first-grade real horse sleeve lining was sold wholesale for 1 tael and 4 qian, and second-grade goods were sold for 1 tael, 3 qian, and 2.5 fen net.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Hardware: Hardware Prices Trending Upward <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai hardware market has not seen significant progress in sales recently, the arrival of goods has been extremely limited, and existing inventories are low. As a result, hardware prices have been rising across the board. Items such as tinplate, plain white iron, square steel, triangular iron, chopped foreign silver dollars, new lead wire, white lead sheet, new pan yuan, and cut iron are all reportedly increasing in price. Other items that have been quiet for a long time, such as blue lead and solder, are also showing signs of rapid price increases. In general, prices are soaring, and supplies are scarce, so the market price is unlikely to decrease in the short term.</p>
<p>Overseas telegrams: Yesterday's Reuters report indicated that English tinplate prices increased by 2 shillings, with 90-pound plates at 17 shillings and 2 pence, and 100-pound plates at 18 shillings. Double-linked 90-pound plates were at 35 shillings, and 100-pound plates were at 36 shillings and 6 pence. American prices increased by 2.5 jiao, with 90-pound plates at 4 yuan, and 100-pound plates at 4 yuan and 2.5 jiao. However, there are still inquiries and negotiations for English goods in Shanghai. American goods are seeing little interest due to the high US exchange rate. In addition, there have been few changes in other markets, so local firms have not been placing orders.</p>
<p>Another telegram from London indicated that tin, lead, and solder prices all fell. The decline in tin prices is due to the failure of the New York conference. Zinc prices remained unchanged.</p>

<p>— Qi Bian</p>
<p>Yu Mei:</p>
<p>Another night has passed, it is now the morning of October 11th. Every night is the same, my hands tightly embrace you, embrace you and kiss you, smile at you, I completely forget that you are not by my side, embracing only my own hard bones, my emaciated body...</p>
<p>Yu Mei, I have nothing to say, I have said everything to you, the emotions of these past few days are indescribable, my depression deepens day by day, my previous patience, I can no longer endure now, my cry, I am sighing, I stomp my feet, sometimes I am simply so angry that I want to destroy myself immediately, destroy all women, destroy this entire world!</p>
<p>I truly never imagined that I am so pitiful, seeing only pairs of lovers walking hand in hand, pairs of sweet-talking lovebirds, why don't I have this kind of happiness? What a joke, I am stronger than all of them in everything, this is a fact, I especially understand women's psychology, understand the true meaning of love, and am so dedicated to love, so responsible, why don't I have a lover? No! Why isn't my lover by my side? Heavens! Is this my destiny? Is there something playing tricks on me, deliberately making me suffer for a few more years before I can find happiness? Yu, everything is in your hands, you will eventually be mine, why deliberately "come so late"! Do you know? Youth cannot be regained, although our spirit will always be youthful, our hearts will always be innocent and tender like children, our love will always burn like a volcano, but time is precious after all! Alas! Why do we have to be separated by the ends of the earth? Why do you want to give me hardship and trap yourself in loneliness?</p>
<p>Yu Mei, I can't bear to tell you about my life these past few days, indeed, I am destroying myself, all day and all night I am immersed in Fenjiu wine, every time I come back from outside drunk, my mind is so confused that I don't know anything, only your shadow is still in front of me, I hold onto the stairs, thinking it is your white lotus-like arms, I hold onto them tightly, I lower my head to kiss them, but, alas! They are just stairs after all, they are a piece of lifeless wood!</p>
<p>Falling onto the bed, I didn't take off my shoes or clothes, and naturally didn't cover myself with the blanket before going to sleep, this sleep will last until the next morning. Yu Mei, you are smart, you completely understand, right? Why do I drink so desperately? In order to avoid insomnia, in order to avoid being unable to get through the long nights of longing, in order to avoid facing your photos and causing me to suffer so much that I want to die... Alas! My beloved Yu, can you bear to see your Heng brother wasting himself like this? His body is your body, his health is your health!</p>
<p>I really can't bear to ruin my body, and I'm not just complaining because of lost love, deliberately drinking, I really can't suppress my heart that misses you, I am sleepless and tearful every night because of thinking of you!</p>
<p>Alas! Yu Mei, what can I say? Everything is the evil created by the economy, everything is the pain created by the economy, what can I say?…</p>
<p>You are too cruel! I truly never imagined that you would treat me this way. Why don't you give me even one letter? If I could just see a sweet letter from you every day, I would definitely get a lot of comfort and would never waste my body like this, sinking into an irredeemable sea of ​​bitterness. Ping, why haven't you sent a letter? Could something unexpected have happened?</p>
<p>·······</p>
<p>Your slave Heng, who loves you deeply and belongs to you forever.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Yu Mei's Reply</p>
<p>Mr. Heng: Please spend less time, I simply can't understand this kind of letter! Li Yu</p>
<h3 id="e279">"Stupid" and "Smart" <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Xia</p>
<p>Regarding the many amazing inventions in European and American countries, friends often have this kind of feeling; alas, Westerners are so smart! This means admiring the intelligence of Westerners and feeling ashamed of Chinese people's inferiority. In fact, what about Chinese people? Those who say Chinese people are stupid are the truly stupid ones.</p>
<p>According to the views of smart people, everything should be "sitting back and enjoying the fruits of labor." For example, the ox works hard to plow the fields, and when the crops grow, the horse leisurely goes to eat them. How stupid the ox is, and how smart the horse is. Chinese people are like this, unwilling to be a hardworking, stupid ox.</p>
<p>Don't believe it? You just take the formula of "ox" and "horse" to extrapolate. For example, if someone invents an electric light, we can use it to play cards. If someone invents a steam engine, we can use it to travel. If someone invents an airplane, we can use it to fuel internal wars. If someone invents the radio, we can lie on the sofa and listen leisurely. We can even use the invention of 606 to more boldly engage in the "romantic affairs" of "talented scholars." People bury themselves in the laboratory, exhausting their life's energy, even the painstaking research and continuous experiments of their sons and grandsons. When the experiment succeeds, we can safely "sit back and enjoy the fruits of labor." You think this is so cost-effective; therefore, Chinese people are not stupid, Chinese people are truly smart.</p>
<p>If Newton were a Chinese person, I think when he saw that ripe and red apple falling from the tree, he would definitely not hesitate to quickly pick it up and take a few bites. What he would think is "this apple tastes pretty good," or "it would be best if one or two more fell down," and would never think "why doesn't this apple fly upwards?" Even more, he would never bury himself in research because of this stupid question. Fortunately, Newton was a foreigner, so this fool finally discovered the three laws of universal gravitation because of this apple.</p>
<p>Among our ancestors, it is said that there was also a great fool called Yu Gong. Although the big mountain that hindered the road was finally moved away by him and his sons and grandsons, the sneer of the clever man Zhisou can still be faintly heard to this day. This smile broke off the foolishness of the Chinese people, so Chinese people have become smart people for generations.</p>
<p>However, smart people, remember, smart people can sometimes be misled by their own cleverness!</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Eiffel Tower in Paris <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Sheng</p>
<p>Towering into the clouds, the Eiffel Tower standing tall on the banks of the Seine in Paris is one of the greatest buildings in the world. This tower is a memorial to the "Centenary of the French Republic". Its magnificent and solemn architecture is intended to inspire citizens and tourists to admire it, thereby arousing personal striving and self-encouragement. At the same time, this tower is also closely related to the beauty of Paris.</p>
<p>The tower is 300 meters high, rectangular in shape, and entirely framed with steel bars. The base of the tower is divided into four legs, occupying a very large area. From bottom to top, it gradually shrinks, divided into three layers. The lowest layer has restaurants, coffee shops, newspaper stands, and other facilities to meet the temporary needs of tourists. The top layer has been opened as a radio station, and tourists are now unable to climb to the very top.</p>
<p>To climb the Eiffel Tower, you have to take the elevator up from the door opened under the tower on the right side of the front. At the same time, a spiral staircase is built in the tower, which can be walked around and up.</p>
<p>Whenever the sun is shining and the wind is mild, climbing to the extreme end of the tower is like being in the sky. From here, overlooking Paris is truly shocking. The vast Paris city can be seen at a glance, the Seine River meandering like a white silk, the nearby streets small to the point of being indescribable, and the vehicles and pedestrians coming and going are only like tiny animals wriggling around. At dusk, the lights of Paris are like tens of thousands of stars, and the Seine River, which runs through the center of Paris, is even more extraordinarily white, and the beauty of the scenery is truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>But this Eiffel Tower, which can strongly stimulate people's senses, has become an advertising tower for the Citroen car factory in the dark night. Around the tower, various colors of electric lights are used, from the top to the lowest layer, to continuously connect and form the seven letters of Citroen, appearing and disappearing from time to time, even one or twenty kilometers away from Paris, it can be seen very clearly. The building famous in the history of art has now been completely commercialized.</p>

<h3 id="e281">My Ideal Lover <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Feng</p>
<p>"Knowing good looks means admiring young women." This sentence seems to illustrate that humans are born with an instinct to pursue love. According to research by some physiologists and psychologists, this instinct is stronger than any other instinct. Although the urge to love is inherent in everyone, it is extremely difficult for us to achieve the purpose of seeking love and find an object that suits our ideal! Therefore, I want to talk about my ideal lover: At the same time, I hope female compatriots will also talk about the objects they require.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about a few kinds of women I'm familiar with. I think Japanese women do have a graceful and moving figure and a gentle and melodious tone, but their semi-barbaric clothing, especially their cow-like waddling gait, is really unbearable; at the same time, their slave-like obedience to their husbands also makes me feel inexplicably uncomfortable. The idea of a virtuous wife and loving mother is not bad, but I always feel that it is interesting for both men and women to obey and love each other. If men are respected like gods by women like Japanese women, it will inevitably make people feel bored. As for French women, their appearance, their dress, their behavior and speech are all impeccable, but according to my intuition, among the three kinds of women I have the most contact with, namely German, French, and Japanese, German women best meet my ideal: they have strong bodies, sincere and passionate feelings, diligent and hard-working spirits, and awareness of serving society. If someone wants me to choose one of the three kinds of women, German, French, and Japanese, I will not hesitate to choose German women. However, since I am Chinese, my ideal lover must of course be a Chinese woman.</p>
<p>Because I spend very little time in the country, I have very few opportunities to contact domestic women, so I don’t know much about their qualities. On the surface, Chinese women seem to have made some progress recently, but most of their decorations are unbearably vulgar, and most of their expressions make people nauseous. At the same time, many modern women seem to regard work as a kind of shame, and everyone only knows how to spend money, play mahjong, watch movies, dance...etc. As for what is called society, country, and the value and meaning of life, they simply don't know or want to know. In fact, this kind of woman is worthless. However, in such a big country as China, I absolutely do not believe that I cannot find an ideal woman. I now try to set a standard as follows: 1. Have a healthy body. 2. Have a gentle personality. 3. Have thrifty habits. 4. Do not admire vanity. 5. Do not play mahjong. 6. Do not participate in the political activities of "political parties". 7. Have something in common with me. My standard is really not harsh at all, but since I returned to China, I have not met such a woman!</p>
<h3 id="e282">The Luo of Yunnan (III) <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>They gathered together, arranged in a chaotic line. Those who beat the gongs beat the gongs, those who knocked the shovels knocked the shovels. Men and women mixed together, talking and laughing, joyfully moving along the country lanes like a long snake towards the river. When they arrived at the river, everyone walked barefoot into the water, filled each person's bowl with clean, fine sand, and then inserted the flowers in each person's hand above the bowl of sand. Returning to the Burmese temple. Everyone pushed the collected sand into the yard and piled it up into a small mountain, and also inserted a part of each person's flowers on this sand pile. People who could dance danced around the sand pile, and those who couldn't dance watched from the side. The sound of music shook the sky, and they dispersed only when it was dusk.</p>
<p>Thereafter, every day was like this, and the pile of sand in the yard grew higher and higher.</p>
<p>It was even more lively during the grand harvesting. On this day, people from several villages gathered together, each person still having a bowl of sand and a bunch of flowers. They paraded from this village to that village, from this Burmese temple to that Burmese temple, the sound of gongs and drums was even louder, and some people even wore strange masks and danced along the way. On this day, many glutinous rice meals were prepared in each village. This was prepared for people to eat. If we ran to visit, we could also get a group.</p>
<p>Their glutinous rice meals are all dyed golden yellow with the flowers of a certain plant, and they have a delicious fragrance when eaten.</p>
<p>At night, many fireworks are set off in the Burmese temple. Their fireworks are made by putting some gunpowder and iron filings in a person's bamboo tube. When released, the fireworks can fly eight zhang high, just like a towering fire tree. After the fireworks are finished, this interesting entertainment is over.</p>
<p>(6) Tusi Officials</p>
<p>The rulers of the Luo are called Tusi officials by the Han people. But among those Luo groups that are directly ruled by the Han people, there are no more Tusi officials.</p>
<p>The Tusi official is like an ancient chieftain. He owns some land, and he can seal off a part of the land to his sons or relatives. In his territory, he has the power to control everything. He can obtain what he requests from the people without paying a penny - whether it is a good-walking horse or a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>The Luo people only have absolute obedience to their Tusi. When meeting the Tusi, they must kowtow. Moreover, when the Tusi does not tell him to stand up or squat down, he must kneel on the ground all the time.</p>
<p>However, the Tusi officials must also kowtow to the Grand Buddha when he sees the Grand Buddha.</p>
<p>(7) Their Marriage</p>
<p>I don't know very much about their marriage, which I feel very ashamed of and very sorry to the readers. However, I can tell you this: the relationship between men and women is very free among the Luo. Many grandmothers and mothers often say to their shy grandchildren: "Go play with the little girl." It can be said that the concept of chastity is very weak in their minds - perhaps completely absent. However, those Luo who live with the Han people have already picked up some hypocritical colors from the Han society.</p>
<p>Brides are usually married off at dawn. They do not sit in sedan chairs, but are led running by two women in the crowd. However, the bride must not walk across the bridge herself. When crossing the bridge, she must be carried by someone.</p>
<p>On the wedding night, there is an entertainment called "hitting songs". This is probably the same nature as the "teasing the bridal chamber" that is very popular in Han society.</p>
<p>On the first night, several square tables are arranged in the yard, and a large wine bottle and many drinking bowls or cups are placed on the tables. Several incense sticks are also lit on the tables. Men and women, everyone gathers around the table, eating wine, singing, and dancing around these square tables. They advance three steps and retreat three steps, sometimes dancing in a circle, sometimes holding hands together to dance. This is how "hitting songs" begins, and it must be played all night or even all night long.</p>
<p>(8) Their Future</p>
<p>The facts tell us that some Luo are serving as military officers in military camps (some are serving as regimental commanders), some Luo have graduated from normal schools and are serving as elementary school teachers, and many Luo children can only speak Mandarin and cannot speak Luo. Many Luo customs have been abandoned, and many Han customs have been adopted by them. In short, they are imitating the Han people everywhere. When you say they are Luo, they will think you are deliberately insulting them, and they will fight with you. Judging from these places, we can already prove that these Luo are gradually being assimilated. At the same time, this also indicates our mission - to educate them and lead them!</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Schoolwork is too busy, and I'm afraid I won't have many opportunities to write articles in the future, so let's organize the old manuscripts first."</p>
<p>He had just opened the book title, took out the physics, chemistry, and advanced algebra textbooks and three or four notebooks, and after sorting them out, he took out the essays he had written in the past from the drawer.</p>
<p>He heard footsteps outside the door. He thought Mrs. Tsuruko was coming up to talk to him. Because he and she had gotten into this habit, he felt extremely lonely if he didn't meet and chat about worldly gossip for one evening, as if he had a wish unfulfilled.</p>
<p>But the amah came in, carrying a pot of boiling water.</p>
<p>"Want to change the tea leaves?"</p>
<p>The amah's voice had no beauty whatsoever.</p>
<p>"No need."</p>
<p>Because it wasn't Mrs. Tsuruko who came up, he was a little disappointed, so he casually answered the amah. He felt in his heart that Mrs. Tsuruko was too hateful, not coming up to see him for so long. At the same time, he became angry at that Japanese man.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the two female guests downstairs, I would really take that baseball bat and beat that old Japanese devil."</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He wanted Mrs. Tsuruko to come up quickly and explain it to him so he could calm down. But using force against the Japanese was just an ideal. When the Japanese got fierce, the Chinese didn't dare to resist at all.</p>
<p>"In case I start a fight and cause a diplomatic problem, that would be terrible. Forget it."</p>
<p>Haiquan became timid again. Although he was flipping through his old manuscripts, he not only had no intention of organizing them, he didn't even want to read them. He was really unable to get over his anger at Mrs. Tsuruko; once she had a Japanese friend, she neglected him.</p>
<p>He sat at his desk, daydreaming for more than two hours, becoming more and more impatient. In the end, he walked to the stairwell and listened with his ear pressed to the floor below. Those Japanese guests still hadn't left, and there was another burst of very happy laughter.</p>
<p>"This is really outrageous!"</p>
<p>Haiquan thought, wasn't this deliberately mocking his loneliness?</p>
<p>He walked back to his desk, feeling an indescribable sadness in his heart. He himself didn't know why he was so angry tonight.</p>
<p>"There are analytical geometry exercises tomorrow, and no matter what, I'm in no mood to calculate them tonight. Tomorrow, when the teacher calls me up, I'll just say I caught a cold and didn't prepare to calculate them."</p>
<p>So he thought of Zhuo Shuhua that he had seen this morning. From Zhuo Shuhua, he was linked to Mrs. Ren, and from Mrs. Ren, he thought of Miss Peizhu in the South.</p>
<p>He heard someone coming up from below again. It was indeed Mrs. Tsuruko. Haiquan was a little angry and couldn't greet her at the door like he usually did.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin!"</p>

<h3 id="e284">Even Confucius and Mencius Have Become Puppets of Puppets <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Buddhist</p>
<p>A gentleman came to Shanghai from Shenyang the other day. According to him, after the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, in addition to vigorously invading in politics and economy, their cultural aggression policy is particularly alarming. They stipulate that the Four Books must be a compulsory course in all schools, etc. Confucius and Mencius are truly two strange creatures of our country. When they were alive, they spoke of benevolence and righteousness to the states of the Zhou Dynasty, but no one believed them. Once they died, suddenly "their doctrine flourished greatly." Not only do our country's ambitious people hang their golden signboard to sell fake medicine, anesthetizing countless heroes and burying countless good men, but now even the puppet state organized by the Japanese also hangs their golden signboard. Aren't Confucius and Mencius becoming puppets of puppets? I can't help but feel wronged for the two gentlemen.</p>
<p>The doctrine of Confucius takes respecting the Zhou Dynasty and "repelling the barbarians" as its purpose, and the sayings of Mencius take advocating benevolence and righteousness and "rejecting military force" as its purpose. Now they insist on pulling Confucius and Mencius to be teachers of Northeast youth, which is really "scolding the monk while facing the Buddha," and can be regarded as "prescribing the right medicine." Wang Mang of the Han Dynasty, secretly harboring different ambitions, opened his mouth with Yao and Shun, and closed his mouth with Zhou and Confucius. Every move was based on ancient times and the so-called former kings. After the decision, the treacherous schemes were fully revealed. Everything in the past was mostly false. As a result, the golden signboard was smashed, and the deceptive means ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Japanese people! Puppets! This kind of policy of fooling the people has long passed, and it is no longer applicable to the modern trend. Our country has already put the Four Books and Five Classics on a high shelf. Only a very small number of schools still use the Four Books as teaching materials for research. Now Japan wants to use this magic weapon to tightly control and anesthetize the youth of the three provinces. This is truly a dream within a dream. I am afraid that the youth of the three provinces will not be utilized by you. Confucius and Mencius will also not be loyal to you. It can be seen that the Japanese still have "Tang Dynasty-ized" minds, and this kind of trick is quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>Do the Japanese really want to know the theories of Confucius and Mencius? I will point out a few words of Mencius for you to listen to.</p>
<p>Mencius said, "Then the king's great desire can be known. He desires to expand the territory, pay court to Qin and Chu, rule China, and pacify the four barbarians. To seek what you desire by doing what you do is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Although you cannot catch fish by climbing a tree, there will be no subsequent disasters. To seek what you desire by doing what you do, and to do it with all your heart and strength, there will surely be disasters."</p>
<p>He also said, "Killing a Yue person for goods, fearing not death, all the people will resent it. This is to be punished without teaching."</p>
<h3 id="e285">Scientific Vegetable Fragrant Oil <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuxin</p>
<p>Many plants contain fragrant oil. This type of fragrant oil is often contained in one part of the plant, such as flowers, leaves, roots, etc., and is mostly used to make cosmetics, because the fragrance of artificial fragrances is ultimately not as elegant and fresh as natural fragrances. Our country uses a lot, but unfortunately, the only domestic product is mint oil.</p>
<p>To extract fragrant oil, first, you must know which part contains the oil:</p>
<p>㈠ Flower fragrant oils are mostly contained in petals. Such as rose, jasmine, honeysuckle, orange blossom, lilac, magnolia, large lavender, violet, etc.</p>
<p>㈡ Leaves that contain fragrant oil include mint leaves, eucalyptus leaves, fragrant grass leaves, wintergreen leaves, laurel leaves, birch leaves, etc.</p>
<p>㈢ Wood and bark sandalwood, camphor tree wood, cedar tree wood, etc.; oil is contained in the bark, such as cinnamon bark.</p>
<p>㈣ Roots and rhizomes angelica root, camphor root, chestnut root, those contained in rhizomes include alfalfa, iris, etc.</p>
<p>㈤ Fruits ripe fruits contain fragrant oil, such as lemon, bergamot, orange, etc.</p>
<p>㈥ Seeds cloves, fennel, bitter almonds, etc.</p>
<p>The method of extracting fragrant oil varies depending on the situation, there are several types:</p>
<p>(1) Pressing method This method is mostly used for fruits. Press the mature fruit peel in a press, and filter the resulting oil with gauze or cotton to obtain it. This method can only be used for plants with a large amount of oil content because it cannot be fully squeezed out.</p>
<p>(2) Maceration method Cut the oil-containing part of the plant into pieces and macerate it in oil or grease. The fragrant oil is then extracted. To a considerable concentration, dissolve it with alcohol, and then evaporate the alcohol to obtain a thick fragrant oil.</p>
<p>Or use a volatile solvent (such as ether, de-ether, carbon tetrachloride, etc.) to pass it through layers of petals (or one part of other plants), then the fragrant oil is completely dissolved by the solvent, and then use evaporation to remove the solvent to obtain it. But it often contains resin, pigment and wax that fall into the volatile solvent.</p>
<p>(3) Distillation method Place the oil-containing plant or part of it in water and distill it: the fragrant oil comes out with the steam. Because water and oil cannot be mixed, remove the water from the resulting milky liquid with a separatory funnel to obtain it. The oil obtained by this method often has a burnt smell because the plant body is easily adhered to the bottom of the pot and burned by the fire.</p>
<p>(4) Steam distillation method The principle of this method is the same as the distillation method, but instead of directly burning with flames, steam is used. That is, the steam emitted from a steam boiler passes through a distiller containing the plant body. The oil obtained by this method is often different from the original aroma of the plant. Because some fragrant oils have a high boiling point and cannot come out with the steam: some are also decomposed by heat: therefore, it is often impossible to obtain the same fragrance as the original plant.</p>
<p>Good fragrant oil is colorless. Has volatility. Each has a special aroma. Easily flows. Its specific gravity is between 0.84 and 0.87. (Cinnamon and clove oil are heavier than water)</p>
<p>Fragrant oil is often exposed to sunlight and can gradually turn yellow or brown. More contact with air, chlorinated, becomes a viscous, difficult-to-flow substance. All fragrant oils have the ability to prevent decay. Some are also used for medicinal purposes, such as mint oil, cinnamon oil, etc.</p>

<p>Years of continuous civil war, coupled with the decline of the world economy, and the skin-cutting pain of September 18th and January 28th, how could the Shanghai market not decline to the extreme! Look at the flags of big sales and big auctions all over the street, blowing their own horns, all they want is to attract some customers, right?</p>
<p>There are usually a lot of clerks in this office: in three rooms, there are at least seventeen or eight people sitting, some typing, some calculating accounts, some drawing blueprints, and a lot of idle talk. This year is not right: business is too slow, income is sharply reduced, and capitalists (Westerners) have to implement a tightening policy, and have successively laid off more than a dozen employees, leaving only a few indispensable key figures.</p>
<p>"My pen hasn't moved today, and I can go home in another hour," said Lao Wang.</p>
<p>Lao Zhang chewed peanuts and said: "There's nothing to do, but there's no way: come, come, let's play a game of chess, okay?"</p>
<p>So Lao Wang and Lao Zhang started a chess battle.</p>
<p>Lao Tao put his hands in his trousers pockets, swayed back and forth, and ran in from the factory: squinting with his nearsighted eyes, watching Lao Wang and Lao Zhang's chess game; while muttering to Lao Zhou, "Lao Zhou, I can finish your Tales of Jianghu Knights tomorrow, lend me a better book."</p>
<p>Lao Zhou ate watermelon seeds, holding a Dream of the Red Chamber and watching it with great absorption, replied, "There are no more books, you can read this Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a shout and chase outside. It turned out that Lao Sun left a love letter on the table while watching chess: Lao Xu took it. When Lao Sun found out, he rushed to fight with Lao Xu. Just when it was about to become uncontrollable, the car arrived outside. The sound of the car door closing immediately made the unrestrained members of the office return to their seats. There was silence.</p>
<p>Lao Wang whispered, "Damn it! What is he doing here again in five minutes?"</p>

<h3 id="e287">How to Prepare to Go to the Countryside <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Isn't the most popular slogan now, besides "Resisting Japan and Saving the Country," chanting "Go to the Countryside"? But, trying to explore the effect, I am afraid that it will not attract many young people to do it in a down-to-earth manner. Of course, one reason is that the prosperous city has bewitched the hearts of the entire youth, making them unwilling to explore the desolate countryside; but I think, society does not give a concrete way, so that young people have something to follow, it is not a major reason. For example, like me, it is mostly because of this reason, and economic pressure, lack of knowledge, make my usual dream of "going to the countryside," especially engaging in "rural cooperative undertakings," has always become an ideal, and still be a clerk in a company, so sir! I want to ask you to answer the following two questions:</p>
<p>㈠ Are there any places in society that provide free training for rural cooperative talents? And please introduce its content.</p>
<p>㈡ If not, what transitional methods should be used to achieve the goal?</p>
<p>Goodbye! Wishing you health! (Guo Ding'an)</p>
<p>Editor's note: Since the Industrial Revolution, whether in Britain or the United States, a large number of farmers have had to abandon their original fields and run to the cities. These people can be said to have been grabbed from the countryside to the city by machines. As a result, the urbanization of cities and the anemia-like desolation of rural areas have progressed with the times. This is a tragedy that has been playing out in Europe for a long time; and now? It is even more bitter that a large number of unemployed workers want to return to the countryside but cannot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, China, which feels backward in everything, is decades late in staging the old tricks of others, which is really a tragic and sad phenomenon. International capital imperialism has long formed a united front. In addition to implementing vicious economic aggression, it also takes advantage of the opportunity to stir up continuous infighting among warlords in your country. Ordinary farmers want to come to the city to be slaves to machines but cannot, and can only turn into cannon fodder or starved corpses.</p>
<p>Shanghai, known as the Paris of the East, is a cursed market. It is the base camp for imperialist aggression against China. Its development is irrigated with the blood and tears of the people of the whole country. Everything is building, everything is equipped, and everything is being Europeanized. Who is not tempted by this intoxicating place? Who still has the perseverance to go to the "desolate countryside"? People who "chant to go to the countryside" are just using the slogan as a signboard, and they still want to sit in cars and circle on asphalt roads, right? Shanghai, I am afraid, has become a cradle that the majority of people absolutely cannot leave. Although "going to the countryside," "relieving the countryside," and "transforming the countryside" ... are currently serious problems recognized by everyone.</p>
<p>Guo Ding'an is a clerk in a company, and he actually wants to realize the slogan "go to the countryside," which cannot but be regarded as a young man with a unique vision. Regarding the two questions raised: First, the school for training rural cooperative talents; as far as the editor knows, there is none yet. Regarding the second question, we have the following opinions to provide to Guo Jun for reference.</p>
<p>㈠ Please read books on rural cooperation first;</p>
<p>㈡ Go to people who have studied rural cooperation for advice; (such as Mr. Wang Zhixin, manager of Xinhua Bank, etc.)</p>
<p>㈢ Go to the model village run by the China Vocational Education Society (in Xugongqiao) for on-site observation.</p>
<p>The editor is aware of his shallow knowledge and limited experience, so he also puts forward this question to ask everyone to express their opinions. The three previous questions are all written below:</p>
<p>㈠ Standing in the position of a clerk, worker, or apprentice, how can we fulfill the obligations of a member of the Republic of China to resist Japan and save the country?</p>
<p>㈡ How can clerks, apprentices, or trainees satisfy their desire for knowledge?</p>
<p>㈢ Standing in the position of a clerk, what methods should be used to engage in communication and improve living conditions?</p>
<p>㈣ Standing in the position of a clerk, what methods should be used to realize the slogan "go to the countryside"?</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But after I washed my face and felt a little clearer, I decided that I must leave. Why is that?</p>
<p>Do you remember, beautiful little pig! Last spring, didn't I disappear for more than a month? Later, in the winter, didn't I also have a gap of forty or fifty days with you? Let me tell you the truth! These two times were both sacrifices and failures of my preparation to endure the pain and break up with you. The so-called going to the Nanjing Judicial Yuan and the Hangzhou Education Department are really all lies!</p>
<p>The first time in the spring, I gradually discovered the pain after Da Jing lost your love. He was originally an unfortunate person who had already lost his love, and he had been so decadent like an old man over sixty years old because of that loss of love; on average, it was not easy to see a smile once every ten days; he lived this tomb-like life for as long as four years. It was not until the end of the year before last, when your little rose was born, that he gradually regained his youthful vitality like a withered tree in spring.</p>
<p>I am his old friend and old classmate. Of course, I am very happy and extremely pleased with the revival of his soul; unfortunately, at the same time, I fell in love with you. Originally, love can only be given to one person: I loved you, so I forgot all the people in the family: you accepted my love, and naturally, you also had some perversions towards Da Jing. This kind of perversion can deceive an ordinary person, but it cannot deceive Zhou Da Jing, whose thoughts are as profound as mine. So he became lifeless again.</p>
<p>One day, he was sick, he was suffering from stomach disease; but he did not drink medicine, but ate and drank a lot of greasy things with cold water. This one shadow character is sharper than a sharp knife, and immediately stabbed a big hole in my heart. The second time, I decided to abandon you.</p>
<p>Although my body did not come to your house, my heart could not forget you. I would even think of you every minute.</p>
<p>"This is not good!" I also felt that if I kept thinking about you all the time, sooner or later, I would repeat my return to you: so I tried my best to plan to drive that ivory snake-like figure out of my brain. After planning for a long time, I finally found a way out. What is that? It is "whoring"!</p>
<p>Whoring was also a common occurrence for me before. When I was studying at the 口Da Middle School, I was already an old customer in the Xiaohuayuan and Huileli areas. To put it bluntly, my dormitory at that time was set up in Huileli, Xiaohuayuan.</p>
<p>Lovely little friend! Little brother! Didn't you often force me to tell you about whoring before? However, at that time, because you were obviously not discussing whoring with me in order to approve of my whoring: you were satirizing me. So I was not willing to tell the truth, so as not to make you angry. But, now, I have been taken by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to thousands of miles away from you: and in fact, I am not allowed to see you again in my lifetime; even if you hate me and despise me, I cannot hope to be affected in any way! Then, should I definitely hide my sins! Okay! Let me tell you something about whoring!</p>
<p>Although I am also a woman, you are noble and happy women, how can you think of the pain of those prostitutes who sit in silk cars and wear new clothes! Their place of residence is called Tangzi in Shanghai; according to your thoughts, Tangzi must be a paradise, a place of pleasure. In fact, they are all ten-foot-long powder hells! They try their best to decorate themselves in hell, waiting for a group of men who have nowhere to vent their desires and nowhere to vent their anger to vent their anger.</p>
<p>I used to belong to the first two categories: last spring, I belonged to the second category!</p>
<p>However, whoring in Shanghai has a difficulty, that is, it cannot be without a partner; when I was madly whoring at the beginning, there were no less than thirteen or fourteen people. Everyone was closer than their own brothers, mixed together every day, and it was easy to whoring at any time and anywhere; later, it suddenly ended, and in a blink of an eye, three years have passed. Now if I want to whoring again, I have no partner! It was easy for me to find a few flower-filled and wine-loving friends who volunteered to join the group.</p>

<h3 id="e289">"Paramount's" Shanghai War Film <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Meilang</p>
<p>...Total profit of more than 2.4 million...</p>
<p>In the Battle of Shanghai, Chinese and Western film companies competed to carry the "camera" to the battlefield to film the war. There were many types of films. At the beginning of the war, the Shanghai-based cameramen of the American "Paramount" and "Fox" companies sent the war newsreels they had filmed as soon as possible. For fear of falling behind, the competition between the two sides was very fierce.</p>
<p>At that time, the films of the two companies were sent from Shanghai on the "President McKinley" at the same time. After completing the film mailing procedures, both parties sent telegrams to notify their respective companies of the facts and requested that they be picked up quickly.</p>
<p>After receiving this message, "Paramount" agreed with the naval authorities and borrowed a seaplane from the nearby fleet to fly to the mooring surface of "Honolulu" to wait. When the "McKinley" came roaring, it immediately attached to the wheel and climbed up, extracted the film and drove the plane to fly to New York.</p>
<p>"Paramount" took comprehensive considerations into account. From "Honolulu" to "New York," a distance of thousands of miles, it also sent two planes to wait in advance at two points with considerable distance. They took turns flying. After such careful arrangement, it arrived first. On the day of the premiere, it was a sensation, and the business was very prosperous. Although "Fox" also used other methods of rapid transportation to try to win, it was already nine hours late.</p>
<p>Recently, people from Paramount said, "Regarding the settlement of the business accounts of this Shanghai war film, the profit was more than 2.4 million."</p>
<p>Betty Lawford, like other female stars in Hollywood, often covers her eyes with her hair. She says that the silver lights on the set are too strong, so she has to protect them a little with her hair. Of course, it would be better to cover her eyes completely, but the facts do not allow it. She is the pearl of famous actor Ernest Lawford. Since starring in The Monkey's Paw, she has become the star of stars.</p>

<h3 id="e290">(1) Jin Yan's Patriotic Heart <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>After the September 18th National Crisis, the people of the country were very angry, and Jin Yan was even more angry, because he was originally a Korean, so he was more concerned about the rise and fall of his homeland! He was more anxious than any Chinese, wishing to immediately recover the Northeast occupied by the Japanese, even though he had no home in the Northeast at that time.</p>
<p>At that time, the emerging theater troupes in Shanghai were surging. There were troupes with the broad goal of anti-imperialism, and troupes with the narrow goal of patriotism. To put it simply, there were only these two types. The Northeast Shanghai Fellow Countrymen's Anti-Japanese Association was preparing to organize a theater troupe and invited Jin Yan to participate. At that time, he agreed with great enthusiasm and said, "This is my personal duty, and of course I cannot refuse." The script selected was "On the Banks of the Yinma River," with Jin Yan as the protagonist. It was prepared to be performed at sea.</p>
<p>Although the play was not performed at that time, it was known how indignant Jin Yan was about the national crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e291">(2) Ruan Lingyu's Face <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>A few days ago, I accidentally turned out an old newspaper and saw a passage about the Chinese movie queen Ruan Lingyu. The passage said that Ruan Lingyu's charm, enthusiasm, and beauty were indeed no less than Clara Bow's, but the only shortcoming was that she had some shallow pockmarks on her face recently. It did not hinder filming with the camera, but it was actually not hidden, which was a pity. That's roughly what it meant, because that newspaper is no longer in my hands.</p>
<p>I have seen Ruan Lingyu before, and I have seen her recently, and it seems that there are no pockmarks on her face. So, what's going on?</p>
<p>If Ruan Lingyu has some fine spots on her face, this is inevitable. However, spots can be completely concealed by decorative techniques when they are young. But now that Ruan Lingyu is not too old, and she does not lack decoration, I am afraid that the spots on her face are not easily seen by outsiders. As for saying that Ruan Lingyu has pockmarks on her face, I do not quite agree with this, because pockmarks are absolutely different from spots.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: I have heard many people say that Ms. Ruan is a fine white pockmark, what a charming name, but I have not seen it carefully. Mr. Sen, why not pay a special visit to recognize the true face of Mount Lu? Not sensitive.</p>

<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Ms. Ai Xia is a rising star among the stars; she was born in Beiping; but her ancestral home is Hebei. Many people mistakenly think that she is from Beiping, but that is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>She is very talented and intelligent. At the age of seventeen, she studied at the Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School in Beiping. She is gentle and amiable, so her classmates are very friendly to her.</p>
<p>She has been fond of drama since she was a child. In her spare time, she especially likes to read drama books. When she has a book in hand, she has the idea of "forgetting to eat and sleep." Later, for some reason, she transferred to another school; after graduation, she established a drama troupe in Beiping. Most of the scripts were written by herself. At that time, she received a warm welcome from the local people; later, the actors dispersed, and it finally disbanded.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 19th year, she came to Shanghai. In response to the invitation of the Nanguo Drama Society, she joined the troupe as a member; once she performed in the play "Father Returns" on a certain stage. She played the lead role and won a lot of praise. But she was not satisfied; she wanted to pursue further studies, and she did intermittent research at Xinhua University of the Arts; a year later, she left Nanguo and entered Tianyi Company through the introduction of her friend; in October of this year. She was transferred from Dayi Company to Mingxing Company; "Old Hatreds and New Sorrows," which was recently premiered in the Central, is her debut work.</p>

<p>— Shangjie</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Tang's passage "Our Young Man" in this journal did feel the need for the young man in the film field, just like the old man in the old play. Even the old cameraman in the studio and the editor of the film magazine are paying attention to the female characters and neglecting the young men.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Tang did not record completely, so I do not avoid the ridicule of drawing a snake and adding feet, and I will add a few more that I know below. Wang Fuqing: He is the earliest first person among Chinese young men. He has joined many companies and achieved good results. Later, he founded the Dadong Company himself. Recently, he directed a play "Spring Breeze and Willow," which may be premiered soon. However, when mentioning him, although people in the film industry respect him as an advanced person, because he has not been on the screen for a long time, everyone has forgotten him.</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong: Because he recently filmed "The History of the Battle of the 19th Route Army" himself, many people have remembered him again. His heyday was around the tenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the films "Good Brothers" and other films he collaborated with his wife Xu E were popular for a while. He is not only an actor, but also often works as a director, photographer, lighting engineer, and projectionist; he can be considered a versatile person.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong: Wang and Wang Fuqing are both old predecessors. He was the film emperor ten years ago. Jin Yan is a disciple he personally promoted.</p>
<p>He has great executive power and founded the "Liuhe Film Company." He collaborated with Zhang Zhiyun and Li Minghui to run the "Great China Film Company." At that time, "Battle Achievement," "Jade Clean and Ice Clear," and "Beauty Trap" were all successful works. Now he has joined the United Company and gone to Hong Kong. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Since the film "Morocco" became popular, Ms. Garbo's mystique seems to have lost its unique appeal.</p>
<p>In the two years since Marlene Dietrich arrived in Hollywood, she has achieved success with five masterpieces, bringing extraordinary brilliance to the film industry.</p>
<p>Some say that Dietrich's style is somewhat like Garbo's. This statement seems credible, yet one cannot fully believe it. It is only that the expressions of both have reached perfection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Garbo and Dietrich not only share similar styles and reputations, but their histories of entering the film industry, and their relationships with directors, are also somewhat similar. At the age of sixteen, Garbo met her director Stiller in Sweden. He persuaded Garbo to join the film world, brought her to Hollywood, guided her, and admired her. Von Sternberg met Dietrich in Germany; similarly, he brought her to America, directed her, and supported her.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in a foreign land, both Garbo and Dietrich felt unfamiliar and lonely. Only the directors who accompanied them day and night were there to protect them. Perhaps it was because their relationships with their respective directors were too close, or perhaps they felt grateful for the painstaking efforts of these two great directors in nurturing them, and wanted to repay their kindness. Therefore, it is rumored that our mysterious duo share a similar secret story with their respective directors. Film industry news</p>

<p>Walt Disney was a clever and young, poor artist. Not long after the end of the European War, he was an employee at a commercial art studio in Kansas City. He often drew advertisements for an agricultural magazine, giving him a thorough understanding of various animals. Sometimes he had to continue working late into the night, so he often prepared snacks in a paper box to satisfy his hunger when he was hungry. At midnight, groups of mice would sneak into the paper box to steal snacks. He found their leaping movements interesting and drew sketches of their dance, which he later published in the magazine and were well-received by readers. After some experimentation, it was filmed and put on the screen.</p>
<p>Four years ago, a 丨丨ＭｏｉｃｄｅｙＭｏｕｃｅ company was established in Hollywood, dedicated to the work of animated cartoons. Now, the company's business is booming, with over three hundred employees. There are also more than sixty artisans who manufacture various toys. According to a recent survey in the United States, there are 300,000 small stores that retail these toys; 172 newspapers carry advertisements for these animated films; and over 15,000 theaters show these films. If a worldwide survey were conducted, the results would be even more astonishing!</p>
<h3 id="e296">News About Crying Bitterly from Film Monographs <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The habit of freely shedding tears may be considered difficult to cultivate by the British and Americans. Because after leaving infancy, they may still have the opportunity to shed tears, but it is very difficult for men to do so. It is not the same for us Chinese. As long as one is not heartbroken or insane, can one not find one or two news items in the daily newspaper that can move you to tears?</p>
<p>Using these tragic reports to elicit your tears is probably easy. This is certainly not the proper method. Because pursuers of art should be rich in emotion. Those rich in emotion, when practicing expressions alone, only need the assistance of the mind and breathing to surely develop the ability to cry genuinely.</p>
<p>Now we are going to practice the eighth style of expression self-study. The student first stands upright facing a mirror. While silently counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight," slowly inhale a breath of air through the nostrils, gradually focusing the gaze on sadness, gradually frowning, and gradually lowering the corners of the lips, transforming into a crying face.</p>
<p>Maintain this crying face while silently counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight." After counting these eight words, then slowly exhale this breath of air through the nostrils. When the degree of crying progresses to the extreme, the heartache and tears that fall will be almost identical to genuine crying. The only difference is that genuine crying is not under your control. This kind of crying expression that resembles genuine crying is completely under your control.</p>
