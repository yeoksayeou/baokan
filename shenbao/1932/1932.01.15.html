<h3>國難緊急中之外交上翰</h3>
<p>丨丨國聯之虚僞與英法之旁觀丨丨</p>
<p>昔德有一匿名政論家。署名路愛特惠著有「世界政策」嘗言「中國者</p>
<p>世界政策之目的物而非主格。在諸目的物中。稀有而最黑暗者也」鳴呼自</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭以來。人爲刀俎。我爲魚肉我文化悠遠之大邦早不成爲國際間</p>
<p>之單位。而爲各國之目的物中國愈黑暗愈予各國以攫取之機會至於今日。此所謂目的物者幾將爲列强撃碎各攫取一塊以去鳴呼。其危爲何如。</p>
<p>我國既處於「目的物」之地位周旋於帝國主義角逐之間。欲圖所以保全此目的物之實際而有所不能於是乃以「顧全面子」爲對外之基本策略希圖保全此目的物之空名。以苟延其殘喘故其外交僅有牽線式之做勢附庸式的應付而從無自動的外交至於最近東北爲暴日所侵占即此目的物爲各國瓜分之開始空名亦幾於不保。而我當局反以不抵抗主義檄告世界呼訴國聯冀其爲我主公道其昧於國際實在之形勢幾等於讀孝經以退賊夫國聯爲大戰後歐洲列强共同制德之工具。其效用既不出歐洲其事業更無補於和平。獨我當局信之賴之。自九一八以迄於今瞬息已將四月日人得寸進尺絕未稍已。國聯三次議决。日本三次違反。此時我當局應亦有所覺悟乃自張學良放棄錦州撤兵入關以後。新政府猶以要求國聯引用某條某條爲對策豈所謂知其不可而爲之聊以敷衍我人民者耶</p>
<p>向毫無强制力的國聯搖尾乞憐其情形等於愚夫愚婦之乞靈於菩薩菩薩不靈復將乞靈於衆羅漢羅漢固與菩薩等也英能助我乎法能助我乎美能助我乎蘇俄能助我乎世界各國能助我乎言外交者不可不先明瞭其情勢。</p>
<p>英爲帝國主義之鼻祖其在華固定之勢力圈自長江流域而蔓延於西藏與其在遠東之最大殖民地印度相銜接至大戰以後。其在華之經淺濟勢力。漸爲日本所潛奪。蘇俄復利用中國以排英。目的爲世界政策日本又利用我之排英以利已。目的在發展其經濟勢力。由是英帝國在華商業上之聲譽地位。遂一落千丈故今日英之目的即在處心積慮。恢復其在華固有之勢力此次東北問題發生。確爲英國在華勢力復振之機會試看抵制日貨之運動方興。而蘭凱塞紗市即勃然有起色。英商界莫不眉飛色舞而代表資產階級之報紙。且以此事用大字標題。引人注意顯見英人之目的專在己利且以政局一方面言。英自捲入世界經濟大恐慌之漩　舉國上下亦皆以經濟國難爲深憂。麥克唐納爾且犧牲其工黨之資格在「共赴國難」之口號下與右黨聯手組閣集其全國一致的力量應付自身之大難猶恐不逮更何暇兼顧我東北耶。</p>
<p>法自中法戰爭以後占有越南爲遠東之根據并藉廣州灣以貫澈其在我西南之勢力圈自大戰告終居勝利之地位。瘡痍平復。突飛猛進。大有進爲歐陸盟主之勢。近復削平安南革命。法國香水大王高的氏且在「民友」日報上。披露其對華政策曰「越南爲中國南部之門戶歷來法國外交當局以對華政策與對越政策截分兩段實爲大謬從今以後應打成一片務使對華即所以對越。對越亦所以對華」其用心已可窺見一斑最近數月前用汽車大王雪鐵龍之名義。組織所謂「中法學術考察團」其目的在打通越南北部與我國西北之路線。其對華之深遠慮。豈可淺測法國在華之經濟勢力較爲微弱。日佔東北。法國視若無覩。說者謂其原因一由於中東鐵路之股票在法人手中者可以向日售脫二則欲利用暴日占我東北之局勢而爲將來由越南進窺我西南之地步。三則以右抑日本。即所以助張英美在華之勢力。於法無益。此三說者固多出於推測。然欲法之助我。有所不能則已顯然可見矣。國聯之虚僞如彼。英法之情勢又如斯。我國尙有呼籲之餘地耶。</p>

<p>山海關十日電稱錦西義勇軍第六七八等大隊與東北軍前線下級軍官合發絕命宣言，由紅螺山專人送到榆關。該宣言末一段說；</p>
<p>『我軍在錦西四周亂山之中，已與日人入於肉摶時期。以彼砲火之烈，以我死傷之衆，皆倍屣於打虎營溝綫諸，而殺敵之多，亦爲前此所未有。明知日軍後援今已絡繹合圍，然我義勇軍及我軍，殘敗部隊，但有線希望，决不置錦州於腦後。所望中央政府速决和戰之計，各派首領，早息意氣之爭，如是我東北四千子弟即使於一二日内，悉數就義，亦當含笑九泉，無所悔恨。···』</p>
<p>讀了這篇東北四千義士血染的宣言，再不捐棄私見，共赴國難，那眞是没有心肝的人了。</p>
<p>這四千人可以不死，如果要死的話，便是死於臨陣退兵之榮臻，便是死於不抵抗之張學良，便是死於口說合作不赴國難之中央政府。他們是去殉國了，這便是他們最後之質問：</p>
<p>『今天說合作：</p>
<p>昨天說合作：</p>
<p>到底不合作，</p>
<p>東北缺一角！</p>
<p>東北缺一角，</p>
<p>合作不合作？</p>
<p>哥哥說統一，</p>
<p>再要不統一，</p>
<p>江山去半壁！</p>
<p>江山去半壁，</p>
<p>統一不統一？』</p>
<h3>龍駒馬</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>古稱周穆王八駿。有追風逐電之捷。唐人詠史詩有句云。八駿日行三萬里。穆王何事重來。即指此也。余幼時喜馳馬試劍。日與諸少年。馳騁於紅塵紫陌間。以賭勝負。同時海上盛行快走馬。湖州董氏之一千紅。烟熏棗　。滾地龍等爲。最員負盛名者。每與並馳。望塵莫及。竊嘆古時所稱龍駒馬。或者類此。浦左喬竹邨。年已望七。喜譚少年事。偶與圍爐暢叙。爲述紅羊時之龍駒馬。彼曾目覩其飛馳。遜淸咸豐末葉。髮匪擾亂江浙。佔據　陵。蘇省祗上海一隅。受外人庇護。尙留一片乾凈土。江蘇巡撫薛煥駐節此間。有官無地之各府縣。麕集依附。日趕其脚靴手版之生活。時有鎭江府知府旗人某太守者。天漢貴胃。蓄馬數十匹。櫪中有八駿者。均有日行千里之譽。喬聞而起好奇之心。趨視該馬。至則但見槽繋一馬。雜毛蒙茸。四蹄如椽。厥狀頗呆。心疑受誑。乃詢諸圉人。咸曰。此龍駒也。君如不信。請於侵晨來觀之。當可見飛行絕跡之能事也。翌晨喬於破曉時即往。伺於轅側。（巡撫轅門前即道台衙門）石獅子上繋馬三四匹。所謂龍駒者。亦在其内。未幾忽見一弁持令箭趨出。攀鞍上馬。緩步出西門。喬即喚一差馬乘之尾於後。比及矌野。加鞭疾馳。但見蹄翻塵起。瞬息而逝。半晌鸞鈴嚮處。馬已馳歸。據述往探匪踪。祗十分鐘奔馳已數十里矣。而髮匪之騎。追之不及。其神速有如是者。可見龍駒之號洵非虚譽也。獨惜世無伯樂。生不逢時耳。</p>
<h3>無從證實之『血衣疊疊』一語</h3>
<p>— 雁宕生</p>
<p>自東北被暴日侵佔以來。學生組織請願團。請政府收回失地。即日出兵。</p>
<p>請願團除北平濟南外。自以滬上學生占大多數。紛紛入京。有數千衆。以純潔之精誠。爲憤激之舉動。事由於不得已。非好爲位也。乃不幸而與軍警衝突。飢寒雪夜露立終宵之不足。又加以囚徒虐待。押赴孝陵衛安置。抑且道路傳聞。有血衣疊疊一語。信疑參半。無從證實。近乃得見某校敎員所作哀靑年一詩。即著眼此無從證實之血衣疊疊一語。錄之以介紹於讀者諸君。蓋亦國難聲中之一疑案也。詩曰。寒風瀟瀟風烈烈。萬人熱血噴胸臆。靑年忠勇竟損軀。不死邊城死京國。結隊請願入都門。雨雪紛紛徹夜立。執政諸公拒不見。桓桓虎士臨大敵。剌刀鋒利一齊舉。徒手靑年皆辟易。痛語傳來驚且疑。血衣疊疊都殷色。落水死猶獲一棺。凶鋒摧陷屍難覓。斯世未應有斯事。驚疑莫定誰能測。强宼蝟集悲東北。鼾睡容他臥榻側。憂心如焚到靑年。何人奮戈去殺賊。除郤英雄馬將軍。餘皆銷聲而匿迹。學子請願云出位。軍人退避先失職。吁嗟乎。靑年不怕死沙塲。裏尸乃不獲馬革。血衣疊疊是耶非。吾聞如是疑難釋。魂兮縹緲不可招。信有之乎寃誰白。</p>
<h3>瀛海談屑</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>得未曾有的大漢已經去世的英人蘭伯德氏。他的體重。竟達一千噸以上。他住在斯丹福。他脚的周圍。有三尺以上的粗。腰的周圍。有九呎四時。但有時竟能跳至七呎以上的高。且常徒步來往於倫敦。烏利乞兩地間。又在他的背上。能負兩個大人。到水中去游泳。後至死時。僱了木工。用長百十二呎的榆木。爲他造長六呎四吋幅廣四呎四吋深二呎四吋的一具大棺。這大棺以二十名的扛夫從他家裏抬出來的。當這具大棺。放在車輪上時。連房屋的墻壁。也爲其震動倒坍。所以到墓地那一段路。特别修成斜坡式。以便運棺。這眞是可算世界有史以來未有的大漢罷。</p>
<p>結婚到三百次的婦人在英國倫敦打破婚姻記錄。中途回家的一位獨身婦人。他說穿過結婚時用的新娘禮服已達三百次。今在國際競賽的流行博覽會中。拿出他的婚服陳設會中。以顯其美。結婚的花圈。也差不多像花屋店一般的。結婚時所僱的伴娘。十足有倫敦與約克兩地的人數。伊此次對人說道。「我到現在都穿着流行的婚服。因爲現在穿這樣的衣。比不得結婚時的不自在。從前很愛聽的結婚歌。現在聽得討壓了。以後我再與第三百○一的新夫結婚時。不願再穿婚服。並且要廢除音樂花籃等儀式哩」。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（十）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第二回談笑對良師傳噩耗家園遇刦零丁憐　友慰悽情旅室生春話說梁笑雲一團高興。三步當兩步的跑到房門邊。滿以爲來造訪的定是那大學高材生安玉田。不想門窗啓處。鑽進一個西裝革履日本人般　的小鬍子。一望而知安玉田决不是這般長相。那人進來後。將手内所拿的一厚册洋裝書。重重向桌子上一扔。拍的一聲響。把梁笑雲迷夢似的心神震醒。凝眸向那人一注視。這才認淸來人即是特約的英文敎師。那人姓魏名卓謀。長得身材短小。又最擅詼諧。很有點笑匠卓别麟的神氣。原當着大學裏的英文講師。只因向好交際。在跳舞塲上認識了梁笑雲。就又兼任了梁笑雲的家庭英文敎授。以友誼而兼師資·對於這項兼差特别盡職。每日下午兩三點鐘時間内　。必定寒暑不避風雨無阻的按時前來講授。從不肯無故請假曠課。比在學校中任事認眞多了。今天進門放下書本。立即笑容可掬的近前來與梁笑雲握手。并向伊頭上臉上身上仔細端詳了幾眼。才鷺　似的笑嘻嘻問道。昨晚又熬了夜吧。曾作何消遣來。今天似乎不很有精神呢。梁笑雲懶　餳餳的微笑道。左不過那此無聊的消遣。累得人好不感覺疲乏。我現在眞有些膩煩那種無謂的酬應了。魏卓謀仍笑道。既然不大爽快。今天的英文課就可以不上了罷。梁笑雲默然的想了想道。閒着也是怪悶的。胡亂上一課吟着玩也行。魏卓謀忙道。有理。我們姑且吟着玩。吟到那裏你不愛吟了。就馬上擱下。我這個老師。對學生是最客氣不過的。怕的是惹煩了學生。下次就軋掉我的飯碗。敎我到那裏再尋得着這樣好館地和好學生。說罷。連忙抄起那本洋裝書。搶前兩步。走到這屋子西首一個小門邊。恭恭敬敬鞠了一躬。又擺開一隻手來很有禮的相讓道。學生小姐。請到書房。梁笑雲被他那麽一做作。忍不住手抿住嘴格格的笑將起來。向這位老師斜了一眼道。這是幹嗎。做老師的對於學生。也好意思這般淘氣嗎。再看那魏卓謀。郤仍然　緊他那一副皮笑肉不笑的滑稽面孔。哈着腰，擺着手。一動也不動的立在門邊。再也一聲兒不肯響。梁笑雲彆不過他，只好亂舞柳腰。腰。蕩搖蓮步。笑得像一朶花被輕薄東風吹得顚狂顫動一樣。低着頭京衝進西廂房那座書齋裏去。魏卓謀一本正經。似一個恭順的僕人·亦步亦趨的在後面跟隨着·</p>

<h3>市黨部電請緩設特種委員會</h3>
<p>於法無據於義無當</p>
<p>昨電詳陳三大理由</p>
<p>國民社云、市黨部致中執會電云、南京中央執行委員會鈞鑒、報載因汪蔣胡三委員不能即時入京、擬在中央政治會議中另設一特種委員會、並推定九人、主持其事、將提請鈞會决議等因、至深惶惑、當此國難緊急時期、中政會應迅速開會、以便主持一切黨國大計、固屬刻不容緩之　、惟是既有中政會之組織、實無再設特種委員會之必要、非維於法無據、且節外生枝、疊床架屋於義亦無所取、將謂三常委不能到京出席耶、則十二月二十九日中政會曾開第三百次會議、由于委員右任主席、議决要案多起、並確定國府各部長之人選、當時三常委固未嘗在京也、是知中政會之開會、固不必定須三常委之出席而後可、况政治會議之常務委員、不過爲會議之主席而已、與常務委員會之成獨立組織者、絕然不同、即無常務委員爲主席、各委員中亦得自推一主席、前例俱在、不難覆按、此不應另設特委會者一也、汪蔣胡三委員爲黨國領袖、我人固殷切企望能聯袂入都、共赴國難、惟事實上既不能同時赴京、則權衡緩急、汪委員近在咫尺、應先命駕入都、常務委員有一人到會、即可召集開會、初不必三常委同時出席、始得成會也、蓋今日之問題、不在制度之本身、而在各人之能否負責、苟不負責、則駢枝複葉、組織雖多、於事無補、此不應另設特委會者二也、前當一中全會時、曾對政治會議議决組織原則三條、其第一條即謂「中央政治會議以中央執行委員中央監察委員組織之、」可知全會原意在集中人才、共同負責、免使少數人獨操大權、獨負責任也、故第二條即謂「設常務委員三人、開會時輪流爲主席、」而不採取常務委員會之組織、前後意義、正可互相說明、今忽以極少數之九人、組織特種委員會、代行政治會議之職權、顯然與前定原則大相背反、况全體會議所定之原則、更非少數委員所能變更、此不應另設特委會者三也、當時外患日亟、國難益深、團結禦侮、猶恐不及、蔣委員旣爲促成團結而去、胡委員實應共赴國難而來、對人則人已去、對事則事已急、故今日惟有一面力促三委員進京就職、一面速開政治會議、主持一切救國大計、人事相顧、莫善於此、特委會之設立、旣於法無據、於義無當、此種畸形組織實應暫從緩議、免生枝節、是否有當、敬乞裁奪、上海特别市執行委員會叩寒、</p>

<h3>謀財害命糞船全家遭難</h3>
<p>收賬欵爲盜偵知</p>
<p>致演種荷花慘劇</p>
<p>本市黃浦江中、有糞船戶林昌桂、因被人謀財、全家被沉入浦中、溺斃男女大小六口、茲將調查所得、分誌於後、</p>
<p>全家以糞船爲生東台人林昌桂、年四十二歲、妻林王氏、年卅六歲、腹中尙有將分娩之身孕、長女同女、年十五歲、次子林寶、年九歲、幼子林根、年七歲、船上又雇船夥顧正雲、年廿八歲、有大號糞船一隻一上海市財政局牌捐號碼爲二○九一二號、向泊上海廣興路碼頭、依舟爲家、</p>
<p>赴楓涇收取賬欵林昌桂係專販運肥料、至松江楓涇等處、往返松滬各處、頗有所獲、伊弟林昌雲、與之共同生活、在楓涇放有賬目二千餘金、本年年初、林昌桂先命伊弟林昌雲到楓涇收賬、旋以未曾收到、故林昌桂復又在滬裝糞一船、到楓涇去、是以闔家隨舟同行到楓涇、後將糞出淸後、遂往各處收賬、已得半數之譜、</p>
<p>兄言旋乃弟緩歸林昌桂收得賬後、以不能放棄上海營業、故於本月十一日上午九時開舟言旋、伊弟林昌雲、因另有私事、故後其兄而行、於十二日方始搭車返滬、</p>
<p>船無恙人物俱杳前日林昌雲到滬後、即往廣興路碼頭、乃不見乃兄之船、只個人計算楓涇到滬、適爲順水、十一日必可到滬、何以二日未到、中心似覺慌張不寧、遂順黃浦向北尋去、直至軍工路定海路浦中發現空船一隻、視之即爲伊兄之船、但船上人口及財物均空無一物、</p>
<p>斷爲種荷花慘劇林昌雲情知有變、遂往報告水巡捕房、當派西探長别利其斯及華探孫阿桂等前往調查、結果斷爲有盜追踪到該處荒僻所在、施以搶掠、且必爲熟人、故一併縛而投諸浦中、蓋即種荷花之慘劇也、</p>

<h3>中國學生不適用「最後一課」的精神周敬庠</h3>
<p>但勿爲無謂輕率被人利用的舉動。</p>
<p>須從實際物質方面救國。</p>
<p>今讀王懋勛君答案三則、其中關於學生的問題、以法蘭西「最後一課」的歷史、做我中國學生、也該有採用這種態度的必要、不贊成有罷課行動、讀了、我覺得有不同的意見、</p>
<p>本來法蘭西學生那種鎭靜態度、實在値得我們欽佩、當然我們中國、最好也能有這些榜樣、不過事實上、即使我們學生做得到、而我國的環境、實在不行　丨簡直不能、試看國難如此危急、當政者那裏有過積極的表示、國家養兵百萬、外寇來侵、只會不抵抗退讓、崇朝之間、失地千里、開世界未有之奇聞、當這國亡無日的時候、幸虧有我們熱血沸烈的靑年學生、犧牲自已寳貴的讀書時間、不畏不撓的出來力竭聲嘶的喚起同胞、中國人口是多的、可是麻木不仁的多、不經過這樣的聲喊、再也不能提醒許多睡獅、這回、在我們民衆方面、已表示了十二分的民族精神、不幸當局勇於私鬥、怯於外敵、辜負了民衆一片愛國心、但這些精神不會銷減、而這些精神團結、學生實居偉功、或許有人說現在吵過了、鬧過了、事實怎樣呢、地依然是失、恥辱依然是恥辱、當局依然是不醒、内爭依然是劇烈、學生吧、只不過犧牲了學業、這話果然說得有理、不過反過來說、要是這回没有學生的熱心運動、中國的民氣、不知更死寂到什麽地步哩、不要說外人進占東三省、就是到了天津、還是麻木的多、在中國的環境、中國的當軸、我們只能認識靑年的學生、我們極需要靑年學生站起來聲呼、更需要學生有積極的運動、「最後一課」、在中國是不能有的、法蘭西因有負責的軍隊、有負責的政府、他們不會使學生着急、更不使學生恐慌、所以雖則普魯士軍隊在吹號了、他們仍在讀書、前線在交戰了、還是讀書、中國呢、不要說罷、我們的血、是熱的、沸的、不能這樣鎭靜、這樣坐視河山破碎、地圖變色啊、我的意思、法蘭西學生、因有法蘭西環境、中國學生、决不能效法這種鎭靜的「最後一課」的精神、不過無謂的、輕率的、被人家利用的舉動、應加愼重注意、同時更應努力科學、從實際物質方面去救國、（丁）</p>

<h3>求學救國·垢</h3>
<p>Ｘ罷課果眞能救國麽？</p>
<p>昨天我在朋友處，看見ＸＸ</p>
<p>大學送給學生家屬的一封通知書·這書的措詞，我已經忘懷了·這書的大意，尙還記得是：</p>
<p>「學生如要愛國運動，請不必來校讀書，如來校讀書，不准再作愛國運動·」</p>
<p>當時我看見了這書，替學生們大大的不平，難道一讀了書，就不准他们愛國麽？難道一讀了書，就敎他們服服貼貼做奴隸麽？</p>
<p>後來风想想倒也有些道理：</p>
<p>愛國運動·板定學生所做的事業麽？不做學生，難道不可以幹愛國運動麽？如曰不做學生，亦可以幹愛國運動，那末愛國事業，何必定要學生去幹？</p>
<p>現在國難當前，學生旣以愛國運動爲前提·自應趕快抛棄書本，澈底去幹愛國運動的事業·等到他日東北失地完全收回，日本帝國主義打倒以後，再到學堂裏去讀書，亦屬未遲·</p>
<p>更進一步說，學生兩字的頭銜，不是隨便可以加的，是父兄犧牲鉅大的學費捐得來的·現在犧牲了鉅大的學費，不去讀書，專門去幹愛國運動，在富有的，充裕的，家庭，原所不計·一般中下社會的家庭，恐怕拿出這樣偌大的學費·也不是一椿很容易的事麽？國愛矣家如何？</p>
<p>更進一步說，各校學生丨或一校中的學生丨的意志，恐未必完全一致，有以愛國爲前提，亦必有以求學爲前提，現在因一般主張愛國爲前提的學生去幹愛國運動，而把一般主張讀書爲前提的學生的時間，經濟，學業，統統犧牲，恐於情於理，·也說不過去·</p>
<p>我更澈底的說，幾個富裕學生的家庭，這區區學費，是不在乎此的，也不妨把這學費，撥作愛國運動費，或者去年全國大水，至今哀鴻遍野，不妨把這種學費移爲振災之欵·也可使一般飢民感激涕零呢：或者把這種學費，到黃浦灘上去削削水片，看看水花，倒也未始不可，何必定要從「學舖子」裏送呢？</p>
<p>有的說學生的愛國運動·是有背景的·有的說學生的愛國運動，是别有道理的·這種閒言語，且不必去加以討論·現在我所欲請問的：</p>
<p>「學堂是什麽地方？學生到學堂裏倒底會些什麽」？</p>
<p>學生欲去愛國運動麽？儘管去幹，儘管澈底去幹，可不必再罔費無謂的學費　　學生欲求學？儘管去讀書·儘管努力去讀書，等到讀成之後，再去幹愛國的事業·</p>
<p>五四運動時，蔡元培先生有兩句話，愛國不忘求學，求學不忘救國，啊！這正眞是欺人的話·</p>

<p>取一根一時之十六分之二内經徑的細玻璃管，長約兩英寸，先將一端用洋燭油（火漆也行）封著管口，另一端管口向上，灌滿硫酸（即磺强水s2So4當心流到皮膚上，以免破爛之慮）灌的方法：用小鐵鉗鋏住管子，在管口上用一小片洋紙捲一小漏斗（上大下尖，尖端留一微小的孔）插上，（插漏斗不要塞住子管口，使空氣好出來）再將硫酸一滴滴的滴到漏斗上，才能灌得進去，灌進後，再將洋蠟油封着管口。（兩端管口，均須封固，切忌硫酸漏出。）</p>
<p>裝一匙氯酸鉀（kclo3）和一匙糖，兩樣混合一起，將這種混合物，用六寸長，三寸寛（英尺）的簿紙，把混合物鋪在這紙的一端，（鋪三分寛二寸長）再把已灌進硫酸的玻璃管，以混合物將全管蓋着，緊緊的捲成一個圓筒，兩端剩的紙頭絞緊，使混合物不致漏掉爲適。然後，放在地下：用一把小釘錘，在一端敲破，使硫酸流出，馬上發出劈的響聲，立刻燃燒起來了，放出綠白色的火光。</p>

<h3>生活方法種種（三）杏子</h3>
<p>是在去年暑天的一個晚上，我同着兩三個朋友科頭跣足在法國公園旁邊的馬路上散步納凉，那時已是午夜了，一對對的靑年男女都帶着倦游歸去的神態，從公園的大口裏吐出來，女人們都如像一隻馴善的猫，溫柔地被擁抱在男人的掖下，微風掠過每一個嬌白的臉，每一個人都帶着掩不住的玫瑰色的微笑。　　在放緃地發出輕柔的微笑與甜密的曼語的一羣裏却雜着鄭重的呻吟，這眞是一椿煞風景的事。不知道是一種什麽心理使我不能不停足看看。</p>
<p>事情是這樣丨一個年近五十的男子，背着一個年近七十的老嫗，走一步，那男子發出一聲吃力的喘，那老嫗也發出一聲低微的呻吟，目光照在他們的臉上，簡直蒼白得可怕。我問那男子：「害辰光爲什麽背着這樣大年紀的人在馬路上走呢？」</p>
<p>於是他放下背上的老人，兩眼雙噙着乞憐的淚，操着漢口白斷繹地說：　　「我原籍是湖北，他是我底老母，我本在老西門開傘店，前晚不幸被火災，什麽都燒光了，現在無存身之地，想回漢口，又没有旅費，我們已經兩天没曾吃飯了，唉，我還不足惜，只苦了我底老母呵！」</p>
<p>「你是不是吸鴉片烟呢」：我用着懷疑與不相信的口吻再問他。</p>
<p>「那裏的　話？先生，我是規規矩矩的商人呀·！」</p>
<p>旁邊忽然走出一個穿短打的人，他自言自語的說：「那是眞的，老西門ＸＸ傘店失火，那是我前天親眼看見的事，燒得眞慘呀·」</p>
<p>這穿短打的人的話冰釋我一切的懷疑，使我對那被難的不幸者丨尤其是對那奄奄一息的老嫗起了絕大的同情之憐念，我馬上跑回我的寓所，將我所有的錢都拿來給了他，猶以爲未足，足又向朋友借了一些來凑數，末了我又爲他呌了一部黃包車，囑他當晚暫找一小旅館過夜，再想法子回漢口去。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>過後十天的光景，我的朋友Ｗ君又在他一條馬路，遇着這同樣的事，而且依舊是那個男子，依舊是那個老婦人。東南西北</p>

<p>上海故事</p>
<h3>上海故事（九）周容編譯</h3>
<p>Ｘ第一次土地管理章程</p>
<p>一八四五年，蘇松太道龔慕九與英領事巴爾福協商，訂定租界土地章程，這種章程對於以後續定的租界的國際社會的管理法有很重大的關係。</p>
<p>租界的範圍又重新劃界，西界擴充至長浜，即今之福建路。租界内的外人不得僱用巡捕，但可僱用保鏣，須得官廳之許可。禁止中國人在租界以内住家。並且禁止界内的中國人不得租借房屋給中國人　，不得翻造房屋租給中國商人『，這種土地管理章程完全是排斥中國人在租界内的勢力於租界内之外，中國人自己的國土，自己不能　足，例讓外人支配一切了。</p>
<p>租界内所有的地主與大房東，皆負有維持租界之責任，並且開始抽收房捐，充界内一切公共事業的費用。由英領事指定界内商人組織一馬路埠頭委員會（英文爲ＣommitteeＲoodsＪetti</p>
<p>es原來中文譯名是否即稱馬路埠頭委員會，尙待查考）。負徵收捐稅之責，一切捐稅的開支用途，均由全體地方與房東管理。除英人以外，其他一切的外人皆須遵守這種土地管理章程，因此這種章程，僅只有中國官吏與英領事的同意才能加以修改。</p>
<p>在租界之内，四條大馬路已經告竣，這四條馬路，即是現在的漢口路，九江路，南京路，北京路，這四條馬路皆是東西橫行的平行線，至今仍是公共租界内極繁盛之中心區域。九江路最寛，有二十五英尺，其他三條馬路，各得二十英尺寛。</p>
<p>Ｘ法租界的成立</p>
<p>自上海英租界成立後，美法兩國派人到廣州請求另闢租界，經粤督耆英代爲奏准，法國第一任駐滬領事孟丁尼（Ｍ·Ｍontigny）於道光二十八年（即公曆一八四九年四月六日）與蘇松太道林某議定劃立法租界。南至城河浜（即今民國路），東至黃浦江，西至關帝廟浜，北至洋涇浜。</p>
<p>法租界成立後，法帝國主義者也和英帝國主義者一樣的排斥一切其他的勞力插足界内，於是中國官吏以及任何其他國官吏，皆不能干涉法租界以内之事。</p>

It is hoped that this incident will come to an end. (14th Guomin Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jin Ronggui Appointed Director of the Harbin Special Police Department</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui has appointed Jin Ronggui as the Director of the Special Police Administration Department. The former director was forced to resign and was appointed as a senior advisor by the Governor's Office. The newly appointed Special Police Director Jin Ronggui is currently a consultant to the Director-General's Office of the Eastern Railway and has served as Special Police Director twice. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Harbin dispatch from the 13th reports that Japanese intelligence agencies in Harbin are colluding with White Russians to disrupt public order and make things difficult for our police. For several months, our Special Police Director Wang Ruihua has maintained order on the ground and prevented riots, which has been resented by the Japanese. They instigated Zhang Jinghui to remove Wang. In order to please the Japanese, Zhang Jinghui advised Wang Ruihua to resign voluntarily. Because Wang believed that he had worked diligently, had been fair to the local area, and had been fair to the country, he was unwilling to resign without a reason. Zhang was forced to officially issue an order today to dismiss Wang and appoint Jin Ronggui as Director. From now on, Japanese influence in Harbin will further increase. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached Between Japan and Russia on the North Manchuria Issue</h3>

<p>(Moscow) Today's newspaper reported a Tokyo telegram reporting on the meeting between Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan Troyanovsky and Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, suggesting that Japan and Russia have reached a complete agreement on all issues in North Manchuria. According to the Yizveshia newspaper, during their long conversation, they discussed all aspects of the situation in North Manchuria and both agreed that Japan and Russia should pay close attention to the activities of certain elements who intend to disrupt relations between Japan and Russia by taking advantage of the current situation. It also stated that after the meeting, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the Russian Ambassador had asked Prime Minister Inukai to pay attention to the news reported in Japanese newspapers that Xi Qia was preparing to launch military operations in North Manchuria with the support of the Japanese authorities. Inukai replied that the Japanese government had not heard of Xi Qia's plan but solemnly stated that the Japanese government fully recognized Russia's important interests in North Manchuria.

<h3>Contents of the Reply to the US Note</h3>
<p>Formally Announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 4 PM on the 14th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally released the reply to the US Minister's Note as follows: Regarding the Note of January 8th, stating that the recent military actions in the Jinzhou area have completely destroyed the last remaining administrative authority of the Republic of China government in South Manchuria before September 18, 1931, our government still firmly believes that the neutral investigation team recently dispatched by the League of Nations Administrative Council will make it easier to resolve the current difficulties between China and Japan. However, in view of the current situation and its own rights and obligations, the US government believes that it has an obligation to notify the governments of China and Japan, that the US government cannot recognize any de facto situation as legal, and that the US government has no intention of recognizing any treaties or agreements entered into by the governments of China and Japan or their representatives that may harm the treaty rights of the US or its people in China, or harm China's sovereignty, independence, territorial and administrative integrity, or violate international policies regarding China, commonly referred to as the Open Door Policy. Furthermore, the US government has no intention of recognizing any situations created or treaties or agreements concluded in violation of the Pact of Paris, signed by China, Japan, and the US on August 27, 1928. This demonstrates the great concern of your government regarding the illegal actions of the Japanese army in the Eastern Provinces and the spirit of your government in maintaining international conventions and the dignity of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Since the Northeast Incident occurred on September 18th of last year, the Chinese government has consistently complied with the obligations stipulated in the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, the Chinese government has not taken any steps to escalate the situation and has requested the attention of the signatory countries in accordance with existing international conventions. However, the Japanese army continued to expand its acts of aggression even after the League of Nations resolutions of September 30th and October 24th. Subsequently, after the League of Nations resolution of December 10th, it openly seized Jinzhou, where the Chinese local government was located, and recently occupied Suizhong and even Shanhaiguan, and increased its deployment of warships and troops in Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, and other places, and there is also a tendency to attack Rehe. Its violation of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and its disregard for the League of Nations' repeated resolutions, has become an undeniable event. All responsibility for this case should be fully borne by the Japanese government. Regarding the section of your government's Note that does not recognize any de facto situation as legal, the Chinese government has repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Japanese government regarding the various acts of aggression and all illegal actions of the Japanese army since September 18th of last year, and has declared to the international community that it does not recognize them. As for the treaties or agreements mentioned in your Note, the Chinese government, based on the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, has no intention of concluding them. It is hoped that your government will continue to enhance the effectiveness of international defense conventions to protect the dignity of these conventions. This is a corresponding Note to Your Excellency, and I hope that you will forward it to your government for investigation and handling. A Note is required. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) China's response to the Note previously sent by the United States to China and Japan was delivered to the US State Department today. The State Department stated that the Chinese reply will be released on Thursday. The Japanese reply has not yet been received. However, the newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa has already returned to Japan, and it is feared that the Japanese reply may be delivered within one or two days.

<h3>Yoshizawa Appointed Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Shigemitsu May Arrive in Tokyo Today</p>
<p>Reply to US Note to be Issued Soon</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yoshizawa, the former Japanese ambassador to France, arrived in Tokyo at 4:55 PM today. He changed into formal attire at Tokyo Station and drove to visit the Emperor. Guided by Minister Hayashi, the Emperor exited the Phoenix Gate, and Prime Minister Inukai stood by His Majesty. The Emperor personally appointed Yoshizawa as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The ceremony was quite solemn. (14th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yoshizawa arrived in Tokyo today. Yoshizawa conferred with local Japanese dignitaries on various military and political affairs when he passed through Shenyang a few days ago. At the same time, Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi will also arrive here from Shanghai tomorrow. After the return of Yoshizawa and Shigemitsu, there will be important developments in the post-Liaoning plans. Yoshizawa has already considered the Japanese reply to the US Note and it will be issued soon. Furthermore, the US diplomatic authorities in Japan have stated that Japanese-US diplomatic relations in 1932 will be negatively affected, but it will not damage the fundamental friendship between the two countries. The Note sent by the US to the Japanese Foreign Ministry is one of the most important steps in US diplomacy in recent years, but the US authorities believe that this move is extremely justified and is consistent with the long-standing Far East policy of the US. The US now wants to mediate Liaoning in the same spirit as the previous mediation of the Russo-Japanese War because the US view of the Chinese-Japanese struggle in Manchuria has not changed much in decades.

<p>Please Do Not Resort to Such a Drastic Measure</p>

<h3>The Great Significance of the Volunteer Army's Resistance Against Tyranny</h3>
<p>The Northeastern half of our country was easily lost in a short time under the chaotic order of non-resistance, and the landscape beyond the Great Wall became bleak, with the Black River mournful. The people of the country were already heartbroken and resentful towards the incompetent and muddleheaded officials who had failed the country and misled the people. Now, Jinzhou has fallen again, and Rehe is in imminent danger. The formal military forces, bearing the heavy responsibility of defending against the enemy and protecting the territory, are still retreating under orders. With the exception of General Ma Zhanshan, all the military men in the country are watching each other, and not a single one has taken the lead in calling for troops to resist the tyranny. Alas! Our people have been squeezed dry to support more than two million soldiers. Are they merely to be tools for a few ambitious people, fueling internal strife, abusing the people, and creating a chaotic situation of division and collapse?</p>
<p>It is said that when the Northeastern Army retreated, the soldiers smashed their rifles, and many lower-ranking officers resigned in protest. The soldiers even expressed that they would be willing to fight the Japanese army to the death even if they ran out of supplies and ammunition. With such vigorous morale and such a resolute military spirit, those who are obsessed with power and willing to harm the country cannot use it, which led to the complete loss of the territory outside the Great Wall, and the enemy's cavalry is approaching, posing a threat to the heartland. Under such lessons, we should be clear that only the people's own armed forces can be relied upon. From now on, if we want to save ourselves and save the country, we must first prepare our own armed forces and resolutely fight against the imperialists and all evil forces that endanger the interests of our country and our people.</p>
<p>At the critical moment in Jinzhou, when the entire Northeastern formal army was retreating, those who held the city firmly and fought to the death against the enemy were only the volunteer army. Eventually, Jinzhou was captured due to the disparity in numbers. Afterwards, volunteer armies in various places rose up one after another, fighting more vigorously and severely wounding the enemy in the Datong Line area. In various places in Liaoning and Jilin, they launched surprise attacks, keeping the enemy exhausted, and their momentum was extremely strong. This volunteer army, which resists tyranny and defends against foreign aggression, is the armed force of our people, fighting for the national soul of our country and the survival of our nation. Their loyalty and bravery are enough to move heaven and earth and make the gods weep. We dare to solemnly declare to the world's powers that although China has military officers who consistently do not resist, the Chinese people will never be people of a subjugated nation. At the same time, we dare to assert that today our people...</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Efforts Amid National Crisis</h3>
<p>丨丨The Hypocrisy of the League of Nations and the Apathy of Britain and France丨丨</p>
<p>A German political commentator, who went by the pseudonym "Lu Aitehui," once wrote in "World Policy": "China is</p>
<p>the object of world policy, not a subject. Among all objects, it is the rarest and the darkest." Alas, since the</p>
<p>Opium War, people have been the knives and cleavers, and we have been the fish and meat. Our ancient and vast nation has long ceased to be a unit in the international community,</p>
<p>but has become an object for various countries. The darker China is, the more opportunities it gives to various countries to seize. Today, this so-called object is about to be shattered by the powers, each seizing a piece to take away. Alas, how dangerous is this?</p>
<p>Since our country is in the position of an "object," caught in the rivalry of imperialists, we want to preserve the reality of this object, but we cannot. Therefore, we take "saving face" as the basic strategy for foreign relations, hoping to preserve the empty name of this object to prolong its remaining life. Therefore, our diplomacy is merely a show of drawing lines, a perfunctory response, and there is never any proactive diplomacy. Recently, the Northeast was occupied by the violent Japanese, which is the beginning of the division of this object by various countries, and even the empty name is almost impossible to preserve. Our authorities, on the other hand, issued a declaration of non-resistance to the world and appealed to the League of Nations, hoping that it would uphold justice for us. Their ignorance of the real situation in the international community is almost like reciting the "Classic of Filial Piety" to repel thieves. The League of Nations is a tool for the European powers to jointly control Germany after the war. Its effectiveness does not extend beyond Europe, and its work does not contribute to peace. Only our authorities believe in it and rely on it. From the September 18th Incident to the present, almost four months have passed in an instant. The Japanese have been taking an inch and wanting a mile, and have never stopped. The League of Nations has made three resolutions, and Japan has violated them three times. At this time, our authorities should also be aware. After Zhang Xueliang abandoned Jinzhou and withdrew his troops to the pass, the new government still took the request for the League of Nations to invoke certain articles as a countermeasure. Is this what is meant by "knowing that it cannot be done but doing it anyway" to perfunctorily deal with our people?</p>
<p>To wag its tail and beg for mercy from the League of Nations, which has no coercive power, is like foolish men and women begging for inspiration from the Bodhisattva. If the Bodhisattva is not effective, they will beg for inspiration from the many Arhats, who are of course equal to the Bodhisattva. Can Britain help us? Can France help us? Can the United States help us? Can Soviet Russia help us? Can all the countries in the world help us? Those who talk about diplomacy must first understand the situation.</p>
<p>Britain is the ancestor of imperialism. Its fixed sphere of influence in China extends from the Yangtze River basin to Tibet, connecting with its largest colony in the Far East, India. After the Great War, its economic power in China was gradually usurped by Japan. Soviet Russia also used China to exclude Britain. The goal is world policy. Japan also used our anti-British sentiment to its own advantage. The goal is to develop its economic power. As a result, the reputation and position of the British Empire in China in terms of commerce have plummeted. Therefore, Britain's goal today is to deliberately and meticulously restore its inherent power in China. The occurrence of the Northeast issue is indeed an opportunity for the resurgence of British power in China. Just look at the rising movement to boycott Japanese goods, and the Lan Ke Sai yarn market has suddenly improved. British merchants are all beaming, and the newspapers representing the bourgeoisie are using this matter with large headlines to attract attention. It is clear that the British people's goal is solely for their own benefit. In terms of the political situation, Britain itself is deeply worried about the economic crisis that has swept the world. MacDonald even sacrificed his Labour Party qualification and joined hands with the right-wing party under the slogan of "going through the national crisis together," gathering the united strength of the entire country to deal with its own difficulties, fearing that it will not be enough. How can it take care of our Northeast?</p>
<p>Since the Sino-French War, France has occupied Vietnam as a base in the Far East and used Guangzhou Bay to penetrate its sphere of influence in our southwest. Since the end of the Great War, it has been in a victorious position. The wounds of war have healed, and it has made rapid progress, with a great potential to become the leader of Europe. Recently, it has suppressed the Annam Revolution. Gao De, the king of French perfume, even disclosed his China policy in the "Min You" Daily, saying, "Vietnam is the gateway to southern China. In the past, French diplomatic authorities divided their China policy and Vietnam policy into two separate sections, which was a great mistake. From now on, they should be integrated into one, so that dealing with China is the same as dealing with Vietnam, and dealing with Vietnam is the same as dealing with China." His intentions can already be seen. Recently, in the name of the automobile king Citroen, he organized the so-called "Sino-French Academic Expedition," the purpose of which is to open up the route between northern Vietnam and our northwest. His deep and far-sighted plans for China cannot be underestimated. France's economic power in China is relatively weak. Japan's occupation of the Northeast is viewed by France as if it does not exist. Some say that the reason is that the shares of the Chinese Eastern Railway in the hands of the French can be sold to Japan. Secondly, they want to use the situation of the violent Japanese occupation of our Northeast to advance into our southwest from Vietnam in the future. Thirdly, suppressing Japan is helping the power of Britain and the United States in China. It is not beneficial to France. These three statements are mostly based on speculation. However, it is already clear that France cannot help us. The hypocrisy of the League of Nations is like that. The situation in Britain and France is like this. Is there still room for our country to appeal?</p>

<p>Important Domestic News</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Gives a Speech in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Chiang Kai-shek gave the following speech to reporters on the 14th:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang and Mr. He came to Fenghua a few days ago. I heard that Mr. Sun Zhesheng also intends to visit. The mountain residence is simple, and transportation is very inconvenient. Moreover, I have not been to Hangzhou for a long time, because the transportation is more convenient here, and it is also more convenient for friends who want to meet. Therefore, I plan to stay here for a while. Recently, there have been comments from the outside world that the country is in such a state that I should come out and take responsibility. In fact, I have never shirked my responsibility to the party and the country in my life. Sometimes, I have even been too responsible, resulting in my foolish loyalty not being understood. Even this time, when I resigned, I had made up my mind early on. However, before the affairs of the country were legally entrusted to someone else, I could not but endure humiliation and temporarily maintain the central government. Later, Guangdong comrades, Mr. Hu Hanmin and others, believed that I must implement my resignation in order to come to Beijing to attend the meeting. In order to promote unity, I resigned from all my posts, so as not to be an obstacle to unification. However, at that time, the formal procedures had not been completed. Therefore, although I resigned, I still lived in Nanjing, waiting for the opening of the First Plenary Session, so that Guangdong comrades could come out to take on the heavy responsibility and complete the formal procedures. Only then did I dare to leave Beijing. Therefore, my resignation from all political affairs was entirely for the benefit of the country, with no personal prejudice. Judging from this series of facts, it is not that I am unwilling to take responsibility, but that I am not allowed to take responsibility. Because I have been foolish and straightforward throughout my life, I have been blamed a lot. I have asked myself that all the measures I have taken in recent years have been based on the party's principles and the laws of the country, and I have never dared to deviate from the norm. However, the outside world often accuses me of being dictatorial. I regret that my sincerity has not been trusted. Therefore, I am willing to take all the blame on myself in order to seek the unification of the party and the country. However, since the First Plenary Session, the new government has been established. I have been living in the mountains, refusing guests, and not asking about political affairs. However, in Guangdong, there are still frequent remarks about preventing the revival of Chiang's dictatorship, and there is still division in politics. This time, I have declined everything, but I still cannot be understood by people. Is it possible for me to come out again to ask about political affairs? If I do not come out, people will say that I am not responsible. If I come out to ask about the affairs of the country, then they will say that the dictatorship has been revived. There is no way to escape blame whether I advance or retreat. Therefore, I can only use my status as an individual citizen to do my best for the party and the country. Also, there are comments from the outside world urging the three leaders, Wang, Chiang, and Hu, to cooperate. I have asked myself that I am a junior in the party, and I can never be called a leader. In the past, because the leaders Wang and Hu were unwilling to share the responsibility for the party and the country, I could not help but follow my comrades and reluctantly shoulder the heavy responsibility to continue the cause of the Premier. Now, Hu Hanmin, the late King, and others have asked me to resign first, as if Mr. Hu and others would not have the opportunity to take responsibility if I did not resign. Therefore, I dare not not resign, and Mr. Hu and others certainly cannot not take responsibility. Our party has now restored its sincere unity. Advanced comrades are numerous and virtuous. If I come out again, I will not be understood by my comrades. Only by being a citizen in opposition can I fulfill my responsibility to assist them. As for cooperation, I have often said that I am still willing to listen to the leadership of advanced comrades and have no prejudices whatsoever. As long as the advanced comrades take care of their words and deeds and do not regard Zhongzheng as unteachable, then if comrades Wang and Hu can sincerely come to Beijing, even if I am in the midst of condemnation, I will be happy to follow them for the sake of the party and the country, and fulfill my duty as an individual citizen. At this time of internal and external troubles, I will do my best to support the authorities' original intentions. However, after carefully examining the political environment and the recent facts, there is little room for me to take responsibility. Therefore, I have to remain in the position of opposition and fulfill my individual responsibilities. You should know that doing one's best for the country is not limited to being in politics or not. As for the current chaos in the country, the reason lies in the failure to distinguish between right and wrong and the lack of clear responsibility. Therefore, if the general public wants to talk about saving the country, they must distinguish between right and wrong and determine responsibility. This is more important than the issue of individual advancement and retreat. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>

The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m. Because the seals were tight, and the content was secretive, it was reported that after some persuasion by a certain important person, the powerful figures in Guangdong have understood Chiang's re-emergence, but they are using the approval of the three agencies as an exchange condition. Chen Jitang has telegraphed Beijing to support Chiang's appointment as Minister of National Defense and urged Hu to go to Beijing. After the Southwest Military Conference is changed to the Pacification Office, Chen Jitang will concurrently serve as the director.

<p>Important Foreign News</p>
<h3>Formation of the New French Cabinet</h3>
<p>Laval Also Serves as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Tardieu Heads the Army</p>
<p>No Major Changes to the Previous Members</p>
<p>Reuter's, Paris, 13th – Due to the death of Minister of the Army Maginot and the resignation of Foreign Minister Briand, Laval intended to reorganize the national cabinet to address important conferences such as those on reparations and disarmament. He invited Herriot to take the position of Foreign Minister, but the Radical Socialist Party did not allow its leader Herriot to take office. As a result, Laval's cabinet collectively resigned on Tuesday. President Doumer then requested Laval to form a new cabinet. Laval immediately set about the task, making slight changes to the old cabinet members. Soon after, he drew up a list of cabinet members and submitted it to the President for review. Laval transferred Minister of Agriculture Tardieu to head the Army, and he himself took on the role of Foreign Minister, as a suitable candidate for this position was difficult to find at the moment. Laval, who had been serving as Minister of the Interior, now also heads the Foreign Ministry. Therefore, he appointed Chautemps to head the Ministry of the Interior, and Fould to head the Ministry of Agriculture in place of Tardieu. All other existing cabinet members remain unchanged. Thus, the cabinet was formed. Although it did not form a national government as desired by the public, pressing global issues such as reparations and disarmament urgently need to be addressed. Therefore, the opposition party is temporarily willing to support the government, pending the general election for the National Assembly. The Radical Socialist Party hopes to win a major victory in the general election in April, so it is unwilling to accept Laval's invitation to join the cabinet. However, on current important international issues, the Radical Socialist Party's views do not differ significantly from Laval's. Regarding Laval's domestic standing, the death of Maginot and the departure of Briand have both weakened Laval's position, as Maginot had the support of the right wing, and Briand was greatly supported by the left wing. Laval seems to be aware of this, so he stated that he has requested Briand to continue lending his influence and experience to the current government. It is expected that Briand will be a Minister without Portfolio and the permanent French representative to the League of Nations. The new government is scheduled to meet with the National Assembly on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Not Participate in the Lausanne Reparations Conference</h3>
<p>National, Washington, 13th – U.S. Secretary of State Stimson announced today that the United States will not send representatives to the international reparations conference. Although the United States has no direct relationship with reparations, its relationship with war debts is extremely significant. The decision of whether or not to participate in the Lausanne Conference has been uncertain for several weeks. Initially, Ogden and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Mills expressed that the United States would only participate if the Lausanne Conference expanded its agenda to discuss global economic and financial issues. Recently, the voices in Europe demanding the cancellation of war debts and reparations have become increasingly louder, and opponents in the United States have also grown in number. It is likely that the U.S. government has therefore made a swift and clear statement. However, although the United States will not formally participate, it will still pay close attention to the Lausanne Conference due to its relationship with war debts.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the International Disarmament Conference is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 14th – Although the Geneva Disarmament Conference is scheduled to open on February 2nd, according to today's news, the most important key to the disarmament issue may not be mentioned before Easter. The first six weeks after the opening will mostly be spent on preliminary discussions, and then the conference will adjourn. By April, the International Labour Conference may need to open, and after the Labour Conference, France and Germany will need to hold parliamentary elections. All of these factors may prevent the Disarmament Conference from immediately resuming after the Easter holiday. If so, a long period of adjournment will be unavoidable. The number of representatives attending may not be as large as expected, as countries are bound to greatly reduce their participating representatives due to economic difficulties.</p>
<h3>British Commission to India</h3>
<p>Proceeding with the Round Table Conference Process</p>
<p>Bombay Bans Anti-British Propaganda</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th – The British members of the three commissions to India to implement the work of the Round Table Conference set off for Bombay today, not deterred by the non-violent resistance movement within India. The British government has decided to ignore the activities of the All-India Congress and continue with the procedures outlined in the Round Table Conference. These three commissions include: ㈠ An Assessment of Financial Standing, chaired by Peel, will assess the financial standing of the central and provincial governments after the reforms. ㈠ The Handling of Suffrage Issues, chaired by Lothian, will establish new mechanisms for the public participation of people in various provinces and important regions. ㈠ The Unification of Financial Relations, chaired by Davidson, will unify the financial relations between the Indian government and several Indian princely states. Representatives of all parties from the previous Round Table Conference, except for members of the All-India Congress, will consult with the three commissions in India to plan its progress. In addition, there is a Working Committee, whose members are appointed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. The British government strongly supports the principles of an all-India federation and a responsible central government, but there must be certain reservations and guarantees for the time being. These three commissions will carry out their investigations in order to achieve this goal. They will have close contact with the British government.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 13th – The blue book on the minutes of the Federal Structure and Minorities Committees of the Indian Round Table Conference was published today. It has 600 pages, with over one million words, and sells for twenty-five shillings. The book is 13 inches long, 8 inches wide, and over an inch thick.</p>
<p>Havas, Bombay, 13th – The Bombay provincial government recently notified newspaper publishers that any news that encourages the non-violent resistance movement will be subject to criminal penalties if published by newspapers. The maximum penalty can be up to two years in prison.</p>
<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon Accused of Using Public Office for Private Gain</h3>

He cited several instances over the years of Mellon favoring private businesses as evidence.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th – At the end of last year, the total amount of Japan's national debt was 6.02 billion yuan, including 255 million yuan in securities from the Ministry of Finance and 75 million yuan in rice securities.

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Nanjing to the Shenbao Newspaper: Today's publication in your newspaper mentions that Vice Minister Duan of the Ministry of Education met with student representatives from National Central University, and that there were telegrams shown from the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, etc. This is not true. Please correct this. Education Ministry Secretariat, Yuan Yin.</p>
<p>Telegram from Guide to the Shenbao Newspaper: The mutiny of the troops in this division is completely untrue. It is likely a mistake due to rumors. Please clarify and correct this to clarify the facts and respect the military's reputation. Headquarters of the Second Cavalry Division, Han Yin.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's telegram to Jiang, Wang, and Hu, addressed to all newspaper offices: I recently sent a telegram to Mr. Jiang Jieshi, Mr. Wang Jingwei, and Mr. Hu Zhantang, which reads: Since the Shenyang Incident occurred, powerful neighbors have deeply invaded, and the people in the North and South are fully aware that foreign insults are taking advantage of internal wars. They are appealing and calling for the establishment of a government united by the whole country, learning from the past to save the crisis. Fortunately, the conference was successful, and the Central Government was newly established. The masses were delighted, thinking that the political situation would be settled from then on. The gentlemen in power are willing to work together with all their hearts, abandoning past petty grievances and planning for the present great cause, implementing sincere unity, and overcoming this difficult situation. Therefore, the actions of Jieshi, Zhantang, and Jingwei have become the focus of public attention. However, what the people across the country have been praying for day and night, hoping that it would be realized soon, has been delayed for too long, and there seems to be no possibility of progress. Mr. Jie is deep in the mountains, almost retreating into obscurity. Mr. Zhantang and Mr. Jingwei also decline due to their health not being fully recovered. As a result, major matters such as diplomacy, finance, and military affairs have all been stalled, foreign troubles are deepening, and government affairs are exhausted, leading to an unprecedented phenomenon. For years, the people have entrusted the power to the Kuomintang, allowing them to use it freely. They all trust that our party has a strategy to build a new China and the ability to stop foreign insults. They are quietly observing and waiting, without daring to object. To this day, such an unfortunate fact has occurred under the rule of the National Government, and the people, because they have always trusted our party, have not uttered a single word to criticize them. They only hope that our party will learn from the past and seek self-improvement to save the crisis. However, the gentlemen who bear the heavy responsibility of leading our party are still hesitant and unwilling to take office, as if their prejudices have not been completely abandoned and cooperation is inconvenient. This means that the people have not abandoned our party, but our party has abandoned the people first. Are the gentlemen, as party leaders, not considering the country or the Kuomintang? People's hopes cannot be betrayed repeatedly, and opportunities cannot be missed again. In my humble opinion, we should take advantage of the fact that the political foundation has not been shaken and the remaining power is still there, gather all the party leaders together, and use their wisdom and courage to determine a strategy for peace and security. Then, perhaps the effects of sunset can still be achieved, and the disaster of destruction can be avoided. If there is further disintegration, or superficial harmony and spiritual discord, once trust is lost, it will be difficult to recover. When the people are extremely disappointed, they will take risks and do anything. By the time the country collapses and there is no way to clean up, even if the gentlemen want to come out again to carry out their ambitions, how can they get it? As a person awaiting punishment, I am struggling to maintain the current situation and do not want to offend too much or add to my guilt. I am merely contributing my humble opinion because of my urgent concerns. I hope you will give it your wise consideration. I am extremely frightened. I am sending this telegram to inform you. Please review it. Zhang Xueliang, Yuanyin.</p>

<p>Burning of the City Party Headquarters and the Min Guo Daily Newspaper Office</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, The Min Guo Daily Newspaper Office on Zhongshan Road, Qingdao, suddenly had two Japanese men, each holding a glass bottle, throw them into the furnace downstairs at 9:15 a.m. on the 11th. They turned and ran away. As soon as they ran out, there was a loud explosion. Fortunately, no one was injured at the time. The newspaper office immediately sounded the alarm and chased after them. Unexpectedly, the Japanese men took out pistols and shot at the pursuing police, firing as they ran until they reached the Japanese Resident Group Department on Hunan Road. Because the Japanese side was intentionally provoking, the police did not pursue them further. That evening, the municipal government lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul, but the Japanese Consul did not reply. Unexpectedly, on the 12th, the situation escalated. At around 9 a.m., many Japanese men, carrying flammable materials, set fire to the Min Guo Daily, surrounded the building, and prevented anyone from putting out the fire. They also opened fire, preventing our fire department from approaching to extinguish the fire, and letting it burn. At 2 p.m., all Japanese residents in the city held a general meeting at the Resident Group Department. At 2 p.m., they set off in formation, shouting "Long live the Japanese Empire!" all the way until they reached the Qingdao City Party Headquarters on Taiping Road. They surrounded the party headquarters and expelled all personnel. At 9 p.m., they set fire to the building. After the City Party Headquarters caught fire, the Japanese were elated, shouting and jumping wildly, and firing guns as a show of force, still not allowing our fire department to approach to extinguish the fire. At the same time, the Japanese warships anchored in the front sea used searchlights to illuminate the city, shining brightly, further fueling the flames. As a result, both the City Party Headquarters and the Min Guo Daily Newspaper Office were completely reduced to ashes. All streets in the city are now closed to pedestrians, and the police have mostly fled. The situation is serious, and people are panicking, feeling that the end is near. (Evening of the 12th)</p>
<h3>Complete Change of Personnel in Shandong's National Tax Agencies</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, All national tax agencies in Shandong are now being taken over by Han Fuju, who has replaced all personnel. Chai Chunlin (former director of the Shandong Local Official Property Clearance Office) has been appointed to the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and Tian Lianzhong (former Linqing Customs Supervisor and Director of the Provincial Government General Affairs Office) has been appointed to the Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau. Both took office today. Chen Weixin (former mayor of Jinan City) has been appointed to the Consolidated Tax Collection Office and also took office today. Zhao Guangpei (Chief of the General Headquarters Staff Office) has been appointed as Deputy Commissioner of Salt Transport in Qingdao. Zhao is currently in Beiping and will go to Qingdao to take office upon his return from Beiping. Qin Chao-wu (Director of the 21st Division's Office in Jinan) has been appointed as Deputy Commissioner of Salt Transport in Yantai and will go to take office in the next few days. Jiao Zilong has been newly appointed to the Anti-Smuggling Brigade of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office and took office today. Someone has also been appointed to the Shandong Provincial Mining Tax Collection Office, and there are reports that he has already taken office, but the name is unknown. According to the new Salt Transport Commissioner Li Wuchen, the local takeover of the salt affairs agencies does not affect foreign debts. After this, salt tax revenue will be allocated to foreign debts first, and the remainder will be retained for the province's military expenses.</p>
<p>Also, Chen Weixin, Director of the Shandong Inspection Office of the Lu-Yu Consolidated Tax Bureau, stated after taking office today that the province's takeover of the national tax agencies was due to the central government's failure to pay Shandong's military expenses for three months. A special request was made to temporarily take over the agencies to make up for the shortfall. Other provinces have already taken over the national tax agencies, and this province has been the latest to take over. The Consolidated Tax Bureau manages flour, cotton yarn, cigarettes, and matches. However, according to the office's past practice, the officers and staff would send the tax revenue to the Central Bank on a regular basis, and the Central Bank would send a list at the end of the month to the office, which would then forward it to the Ministry of Finance. It was just an empty forwarding agency. It is said that the office's tax revenue can reach tens of thousands of yuan per month. (12th)</p>
<h3>The Issue of Reorganization of Liu Guitang's Troops</h3>
<p>Liu Requests Military Uniforms First</p>
<p>And Waiting for Yin's Troops to Open Gaotang</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, After Liu Guitang, Yin Shigui, and Guo Wensheng's (i.e., Guo Ma Feng) troops arrived at Da Wen Kou from Da Bianqiao, they wanted to go on foot to Gaotang after being reorganized at Da Wen Kou. However, Shandong Governor Han Fuju still ordered them to take a car to Gaotang first, and then send someone to reorganize them. Yesterday, Han sent a telegram to Liu explaining everything, and also sent Adjutant Director Meng Guangshan, together with Liu Guitang's representative Xia Ziming, and Zhang Futian, the original introducer from the Shandong Native Place Association in Tianjin, to Da Wen Kou to meet Liu and convey Han's intentions. Meng Guangshan also prepared vehicles in Da Wen Kou to prepare for transportation. Meng, Xia, and Zhang took a car from Jinan at 9:00 a.m. this morning (12th) and arrived at Da Wen Kou at 1:00 p.m. At that time, Liu Guitang's troops were there to greet them. Although they were all in plain clothes, their spirits were very good. Zhang Yuru, the president of the Da Wen Kou Chamber of Commerce, also came to the station to welcome them. They entered the town together. Slogans were posted all along the way, reading "Welcome Military Commander Liu" and "Welcome Military Commander Liu, who defeated the Japanese at Sai Ma Zhan Shan." Xia and others went directly to the Yuelai Store, because Liu Guitang's headquarters was located there. When they arrived at the Yuelai Store, Liu personally went out on horseback to patrol the streets to prevent his subordinates from acting out of line. Xia and others waited temporarily. After a short while, Liu returned and greeted each other. After sitting down, they talked. Liu spoke frankly and did not lose the true colors of a bandit. Xia and Zhang first reported on the situation in Jinan and Governor Han's hope that he would take a car to Gaotang first for reorganization. Liu replied that his surrender this time was because he was from Shandong. He had been a military commander and division commander and had led troops for more than ten years. Out of love for his hometown, he surrendered. He was forty years old. Four or five years ago, he heard that there were runners in the South Mountain with a total of 6,000 guns. The first time he was taken over by Zhang Jingyao and disarmed in Hunan. The second time he was taken over by Wu Yuyu and disarmed in the old nest, with 3,000 guns disarmed, leaving only 1,000 guns. The third time he was taken over by Sun Meiyao, and disarmed by Wu Ziming of the Fifth Division, leaving only 1,000 guns. The fourth time he was taken over and disarmed by Xu Kun. He went to Henan and served as a vanguard army during the Northern Expedition, making great contributions to defeating Zhang Zongchang. When he was in Henan, he guarded Yu Prefecture and claimed that he had made no mistakes. Even if he had made mistakes, he should have been remembered for his past achievements, but he was still resolved. His surrender this time was the fifth time. He was very grateful to Governor Han and hated that he could not open his heart for people to see. He decided to repay Governor Han. When he was in the mountains, the Japanese went to buy him to disrupt Jiaodong, but he refused. When he was in Rizhao, the Japanese came twice, willing to help with guns and money, to make him disrupt the area. He would rather go begging than be used by the Japanese, etc.</p>
<p>It is heard that Liu had two requests: 1. Send military uniforms first, then open Gaotang. 2. Wait for Yin Shigui's troops to open Gaotang together. He planned to ask Xia Ziming to go to Teng County from Da Wen Kou on the 13th to pull Yin Shigui's troops. Yin's troops have more than 2,000 guns in the mountains. Liu said that he would never abandon them. Yin's troops also wanted to walk to Da Wen Kou and did not want to take a car. Liu also said that his troops had 10,000 people, and 10,000 sets of military uniforms would only cost 30,000 yuan, while disrupting a village would cause greater losses. Finally, Liu also said that if 20,000 people were used to solve his troops, it would be better to use these 30,000 people to fight the Japanese. He believed that this time's surrender would completely pull out all the large and small bandits to serve the country, so that the 40-year banditry in southern Shandong would be completely suppressed, which would be a better strategy, etc. It is heard that Xia and others immediately reported to Han by telegram Liu's request for military uniforms first and then open Gaotang, and wait for Yin Shigui to go together, asking for instructions on how to handle it. The armored car from Beiping opened Da Wen Kou from Jinan at 3:00 p.m. today.</p>
<p>Regarding the telegrams between Gu Liangmin, Liu Shuxiang, and Han Fuju regarding the reorganization of Liu Guitang and Guo's troops, the appendix is as follows: 1. Gu and Liu's telegram, Commander-in-Chief Han Junjian: Zi Mi reported that according to a telegram from Liu Guitang of Da Wen Kou, (1) his troops are very sincere in their surrender this time, and Junzuo is willing to accept them, and they are grateful for the rebuilding. He is ordered to open Gaotang, and he is happy to obey. The only difficulty is that there are more than 3,000 bandits in Yishui and Nanshan who have not arrived. He intends to gather the remaining bandits in these two places and send them out of the mountains, so that they will no longer harm the residents. Otherwise, if the remaining bandits are not pacified, it is inevitable that they will spread again. It is impossible to imagine the harm. He pleaded to ask Junzuo to delay the deadline for a few days in order to gather the remaining bandits in that area. When the bandits arrive at Da Wen Kou, the troops will set off north at the same time, and there will be no other problems. After reviewing the content of the telegram, it is not unreasonable. May I ask if I can approve the request? Please make a decision. (2) The troops are currently wearing plain clothes, which is not very elegant. Please ask Junzuo to send a number of military uniforms first for needs and for rectification. Please send me a telegram on how to handle it. Sincerely send the telegram to Chen, Zigu Liangmin Liu Shuxiang Yin Zhen Xu Yin 2. Han Fuju's reply telegram, Yanzhou Division Commander Gu Jingxuan Brother Liu Director Weizhen Brother Jian, Michen Wu Dian, reported two items, I have heard everything, now I received Liu Guitang Zhenwei Diankai, and the staff has arrived at Da Wen Kou, and I originally planned to board the train in compliance with the order, but only one part of Guo Yin's troops has arrived, and the rest are in the mountains, and are gathering to set off, etc. Brother replied to his telegram, if those who arrive at Da Wen Kou are very good if they set off first, otherwise there are still many doubts, Da Wen Kou is an important place on the Jinpu Road, who dares to be responsible once something unexpected happens? This is the biggest reason why brother can't help but doubt them. I hope my brother will pay special attention, this reply, Han Fuju Wen Shen Yin Can,</p>
<h3>Huang Xiansheng Reports on the Anti-Japanese War Efforts of the Volunteer Army Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association of Northeastern People in Beiping held a welcome meeting at the Fengtian Guildhall at 1:30 PM on the 11th, attended by over fifty people to welcome Huang Xiansheng, the Commissioner of Liaoning Police, who had returned from Shenyang. The meeting was chaired by Wang Huayi, the president of the association. After the opening remarks by the chairman, Huang Xiansheng reported on the volunteer army's battle with the Japanese army outside the pass. Finally, the chairman gave a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM. The following is a transcript of Huang Xiansheng's report:</p>
<p>Before reporting on the fourteen days of fighting between the volunteer army and the Japanese army, I would like to first explain the origins of the volunteer army. Most people regard the volunteer army as bandits, but before the September 18th Incident, the total number of bandits in the province was only about 1,800. After the incident, volunteer armies sprang up everywhere, which proves that the volunteer army is not made up of bandits. Before the Anti-Japanese Association took the lead, the volunteer army may have had some irregularities, and their food and clothing were not systematically arranged, so they raised funds everywhere, which the Japanese then used to spread propaganda about them being bandits. In fact, the volunteer army is a group of ordinary people in the Eastern Provinces who have risen up to defend themselves. These untrained ordinary people are using 19th-century weapons to resist a powerful country with modern weaponry. Therefore, we should study the organization and guidance of the volunteer army based on the current situation in order to confront the enemy and recover the lost territory.</p>
<p>The first time the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou, the troops passed through Xinmin. Due to the inconvenience of transportation at the time, it was agreed that when the Japanese army passed through Xinmin, the volunteer army would rise up and fight them. After the Japanese army passed Xinmin, the volunteer army occupied Juluhe and advanced to Huanggu Tun. Both sides suffered enormous losses in the battle.</p>
<p>The original plan of the Japanese army was to attack Jinzhou with a brigade, but they realized the danger of attacking along a single route, so the Japanese army changed their plan. Originally, the Tamon Division was to attack Heilongjiang, and a brigade transferred from Hokkaido was to attack Jinzhou. After the change of plan, three brigades from Hokkaido were transferred to attack Heilongjiang, the Tamon Division attacked Jinzhou, and two brigades were transferred from Korea to attack Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>On December 20th, the Japanese army launched an offensive from Xingcheng. At Menling, they began to clash with the 14th Detachment of the Second Route of our Volunteer Army. The Japanese side had four to five hundred cavalrymen, while our side had even more cavalrymen. The Second and Fourth Routes concentrated their forces in Shaling to fight, and the Japanese army was unable to advance. Later, the Japanese army set out for Tianzhuangtai, and two battalions of our 19th Brigade and one battalion of the Coastal Defense Brigade were trapped. The two battalions of the 19th Brigade escaped, but the Coastal Defense Brigade was never able to retreat. Later, the volunteer army went to their aid and fought fiercely for two days and two nights before they were able to lift the siege. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The volunteer army captured eleven cannons (including six Taisho mountain guns and five new-style cannons), captured forty-eight prisoners, and seized two hundred and seventy-three rifles. Later, more than eighty Japanese soldiers were surrounded by our army, but the local business community compromised with the Japanese army and fought against us, which allowed the Japanese army to break the siege.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the 19th Brigade of Panshan completely withdrew without notifying the volunteer army, which led to the Japanese occupation. Later, the volunteer army recaptured it. At that time, there were more than four hundred wounded volunteer soldiers in Tianzhuangtai, Dakua, and Shaling, and the hospitals and other places were not prepared. Those with minor injuries were given fifty silver dollars each and sent to neighboring villages, and over a hundred people were transported to Jinzhou to prevent them from being secretly attacked by the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 30th, contact began at Dagushan. At that time, each volunteer soldier had one hundred and fifty bullets, but by the time they reached the north bank of the Daling River, each soldier only had thirty or forty bullets. By the 1st, bullets could not be transported, and order along the stations was also disrupted, so by the morning of the 2nd, the source of bullets had been cut off. However, the Second Detachment of our Volunteer Army fought very well, surrounding forty Japanese soldiers in a village. More than two hundred volunteer soldiers rode horses to Jinzhou to collect bullets, but due to the lack of bullets, they were unable to do so. At that time, the officer burst into tears and gave all the bullets in his possession to them to take away.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd, when the Japanese army intended to attack Jinzhou, all the troops in Jinzhou were mobilized and a section of the railway was destroyed. On the evening of the 3rd, the personnel withdrew from Jinxi. This war lasted for fourteen days, and a total of eleven cannons and over four hundred and eighty rifles were obtained. The purpose of coming to Beiping this time is to plan future combat strategies, the source of bullets, and the compensation for the casualties.</p>
<p>I can also briefly report on the enemy's plans. After the Japanese army presses the Liaoxi army into the pass, they plan to have Zhang Xiantao's army occupy Rehe. On the 4th, they will mobilize the Tamon army to clear our army in Liaodong, and then they will use their entire force to clear our army in Jilin and Heilongjiang. For the civilians, they will confiscate weapons and eliminate the strength of the people. Economically, they plan to use all the Feng Piao notes of the official silver bank to purchase grain and produce from the people, and then issue Municipal Bank notes "kind" and declare Feng Piao notes invalid in order to cut off the people's economy.</p>
<h3>The National Government Persuades Li Mingzhong to Stay</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Commissioner of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region and concurrently the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Hubei Bandit Suppression, had previously resigned from the National Government due to illness and went to Huangpi to await orders. After receiving the telegram, the National Government, recognizing Li's remarkable achievements in pacifying the local area, replied on the 12th to persuade him to stay. At the same time, Chief of Staff Zhu Peide and Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin also replied, expressing their concern for his illness and urging him to continue to shoulder the heavy responsibility at a time of national crisis, to quell internal disturbances and resist foreign aggression, and to work together for the country.</p>
<p>Li went to Huangpi on the 11th and returned to Hankou on the 12th. After reading the two telegrams, he reportedly cancelled his resignation. He will continue to lead his troops to suppress bandits. Although the bandit leader, Kuang, has retreated from Huang'an, he has not suffered any real losses. It is reported that the Central Government has decided to order the troops stationed in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei to carry out a thorough joint suppression. The Eastern Hubei front will be under the command of Li, with the 30th, 31st, 33rd, 13th, and part of the 48th Divisions under his command. The Southern Henan front will be under the command of Zhang Fang, with the 11th, 45th, 58th, 75th, 76th, and 20th Divisions under his command. The Western Anhui front will be under the command of Yue Shengxuan, with the 46th, 55th, one brigade of the 57th Division, and the Zheng and Song brigades under his command. All of these forces will be under the direct command of Liu Zhi, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Henan. The total bandit suppression force is about thirteen divisions, which should be enough to wipe them out in one fell swoop. (January 13th)</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Hubei Refugees Cause Great Disturbance: Yesterday, over five hundred refugees from Huangmei County, Hubei, arrived in the area from Songjiang. As they passed through Zhugang, it was already late at night. The refugees, using the excuse of borrowing stoves to cook, entered people's homes and caused great disturbances. At the same time, they swarmed into the residence of Xue Zhaoqian, a wealthy household in the area, and robbed him of gold, silver, jewelry, cloth, food, and other items worth several hundred dollars. After receiving the report today, the county's Public Security Bureau immediately sent police to drive them away to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>Wrongful Accusation of Communist Party Membership Leads to Six-Month Sentence: Gu Genlou, a villager from Sanjiao Yang Township in the Second District, was sentenced to six months in prison for falsely accusing his uncle, Gu Meisheng, and his maternal uncle, Chen Chunlin, of being communists because he had been unable to borrow money from them. The case was initially investigated by the Fourth Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Police stationed there and sent to the county government. After investigation, they were found to be innocent and were released on bail. At the same time, Gu Genlou was sentenced to six months in prison for false accusation as a warning. However, Gu appealed to the High Court after the sentence was pronounced in court, expressing his dissatisfaction. After repeated trials, the court found no reason to overturn the original verdict. Therefore, the court yesterday (the 13th) sent the accused back to the original trial court for enforcement.</p>

Our association and others are deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. We humbly request that you consider public opinion and make a clear statement that the rumor of suspending the payment of principal and interest on bonds will never be realized. We also request that all provinces not withhold tax revenues in order to secure the central government and maintain public confidence."</p>
<p>Gu Enjin's Embezzlement Case Appeals Sentencing: Gu Enjin, the former manager of the Changshu branch of the Bank of Communications, embezzled over 280,000 yuan of the bank's funds and fled to Suzhou. He was arrested and handed over to the local court, which sentenced him to six months in prison and a fine of 1,000 yuan. Gu appealed to the High Court, dissatisfied with the original verdict. Yesterday (the 14th), the court announced its verdict, overturning the original sentence. Gu Enjin was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 1,500 yuan for embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Suzhou Robbery Suspects Arrested in Wuxi: Xun Gongting, the patrol officer of the First Police Station of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau at the Shangpailou in the South Gate of this county, led police officers to seize a stolen boat in front of the Fengfu Silk Factory under the nearby Ta Bridge the day before yesterday. Three robbers, Chen Wenxi, Jiang Er, and Jiang Minshi, were arrested. After being brought to the police station for strict interrogation, Chen and the others confessed that they had previously robbed the home of Qian Songyao, a resident of No. 28 Enpo Lane in Suzhou City. Director Hua of the Public Security Bureau immediately telegraphed the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, requesting that they send personnel with documents to Wuxi to arrest and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Joint Defense Measures on the Border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang: The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have recently been concerned about the bandits of Taihu Lake, who frequently cause trouble. In order to eliminate bandits and stabilize the border area, they have ordered the water police of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to conduct joint patrols on a regular basis and have formulated the following permanent joint defense measures for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border:</p>
<p>1.  Fifteen counties, including Wujiang, Wuxian, Songjiang, Qingpu, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing in Jiangsu, and Changxing, Tongxiang, Chongde, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Jiashan in Zhejiang, will be designated as permanent joint defense areas.</p>
<p>2.  The locations of the army, navy, and police stationed within the defense area will be reported by the senior officers of each side once a month. Any changes will be reported immediately.</p>
<p>3.  The army, navy, and police stationed within the defense area should closely investigate the bandits within the defense area, clearly identifying the number of personnel, weapons, and bases, and reporting them to each other for joint suppression.</p>
<p>4.  In the event of bandit activity within the area, all army, navy, and police, regardless of where it occurs or which jurisdiction it belongs to, must immediately report to each other and cooperate in the suppression, without dividing the border between provinces and counties or the chain of command, which would cause obstruction. Violators will be punished for dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>5.  If bandits appear within the defense area, the army, navy, and police must track them down and eliminate them.</p>
<p>6.  The passwords, signals, and flags used by the army, navy, and police in the defense area when suppressing bandits will be carefully determined by the senior officers of the two provinces and reported to each other for implementation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Two Robbery Cases Occur in the Suburbs: Three bandits suddenly came to the Silkworm Seed Improvement Center outside the West Gate, entered and robbed them, but since there was no silver, they forcibly took several pieces of clothing and left. Also, the home of Duan Apei in Xieyuan Township outside the South Gate was visited by more than ten bandits at eleven o'clock the night before last. They entered and robbed him. Apei had died many years ago, and his wife was sleeping alone at home. She was first raped by the bandits and then wrapped in a sheet, intending to kidnap her. Fearing that she would make noise, they stabbed her in the face with a knife and robbed her of more than two hundred silver dollars. Duan's wife was abandoned in a wheat field halfway there.</p>

The county party headquarters resolved at its regular meeting on the 12th to send a letter to the county to dismiss Cao.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Butcher Shop Owner Illegally Sells Military Supplies: Ma Laogen, a butcher shop owner in Wufengkou, Zhenjiang, was illegally transporting military supplies to supply bandits.

<p>Supervisory Yuan Thoroughly Investigates Corruption Case on the Beijing-Hangzhou Road: The case of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction's Beijing-Hangzhou Road Project, involving the falsification of reports and embezzlement of large sums of money, has been pending for a long time since it was transferred to the Zhenjiang Court for investigation. Now, the National Government's Supervisory Yuan, based on the report of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, has specially appointed three auditors from the Audit Department, Yin Gongwu, Wang Qichang, and Shao Chuanxin, to come to the province yesterday to investigate. They have already obtained case files from the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the Zhenjiang Local Court. It is hoped that this large-scale corruption case will soon be brought to light.</p>
<p>Huge Amount of Opium Transported by Ship: At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the Osaka Company's Wuchang ship from Hankou passed through Zhenjiang. Zhang Guangyou reported from Hankou that there were forty-eight loads of opium being transported to Shanghai. Zhang then reported to the 121st Brigade of the 61st Division stationed in Zhenjiang. Brigade Commander Zhang Li sent a team to board the ship and search it. They found a large quantity of opium, totaling twelve Western flour sacks and two hemp sacks, all filled with opium, weighing approximately 13,000 taels. The opium was immediately unloaded and transported ashore. The ship was delayed as a result and did not depart for Shanghai until after 4:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Mianbing Industry's Business Tax is Not Allowed to be Exempted: The Jiangdu Mianbing Industry representatives, Gao Jin and others, jointly submitted a request to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting exemption from business tax. Director Shu of the Department of Finance, based on the telegram from the County Chamber of Commerce, presented the previous reasons and requested review. He specially ordered the County Chamber of Commerce, stating that the pastry industry listed in the tax rate table for the sales industry refers to all kinds of pastries. If the annual turnover is over 1,000 yuan, it should be taxed accordingly. If it is less than the specified amount, it will not be taxed. Chairman Wang of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 12th) forwarded the order to the tax collector Hui Bingwen to collect taxes in accordance with the regulations and informed the industry representatives to comply.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases Occur Consecutively in Yizheng Town: The home of Li Zhaozhu, a villager in Yiling Town, was suddenly visited by eight or nine bandits armed with short guns the night before (the 9th). They broke into the house and looted extensively, stealing clothes and other items. At the same time, the home of Jiang Zhihuai near the town was also visited by more than ten bandits who entered and tied Zhihuai's elderly father, Jiang Litan, to the stove. They first used fire to interrogate him, then stripped off his clothes.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Bandits Murder the Victim: Li Shichen, a farmer in Touxiang Erzha, Huaiyin, was extremely poor and had nothing hidden in his home. At 11:00 PM on the 8th, more than ten bandits suddenly came and tied up Shichen. Shichen's wife, Zhang, saw her husband being carried away by the bandits and followed behind, crying for help. After walking half a mile, the bandits shot Shichen to death and strangled his neck with a rope. By the time Li Zhang arrived, Shichen had died and could not be saved.

He said that he is a party member and it is his duty to serve the party. He stated that he did not come to Jiangsu to be an official, but to do things. In the future, he is willing to shoulder the responsibility of Jiangsu's education with an unyielding and hardworking spirit. He said that if he cannot succeed, he will resign immediately and will not cling to his position.</p>
<h3>CU Representatives Petition to Maintain Education Funding</h3>
<p>More than thirty student representatives, including Jiang Mianju from National Central University, and six teachers, including Yang Gongda (representative of the president) and He Haoruo, petitioned in Zhenjiang at 2:00 PM on the 12th because the Executive Yuan had decided on August 20th of the 18th year of the Republic of China that 1.32 million yuan would be allocated annually by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. Currently, 610,000 yuan is in arrears. The newly appointed Director of Education in Jiangsu, Zhou Fohai, proposed at a provincial committee meeting, due to the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province, that the allocation of funds would be stopped starting in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The students are terrified and have made five demands:</p>
<p>1.  Request that the Education Funding Management Office pay off the arrears.</p>
<p>2.  Zhou Education Director's proposal to not pay from the 21st year onwards violates the Yuan's order.</p>
<p>3.  That it be based on the State Council's proposal for permanent compliance and be maintained by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office.</p>
<p>4.  Guarantee that there will be no arrears without reason.</p>
<p>5.  Express sympathy for the school's difficulties, but oppose sacrificing NCU.</p>
<p>6.  Express the difficulties of the school to the education community.</p>
<p>At the time, the Education Funding Management Office was in a meeting and agreed to allow a representative to attend as an observer. The representatives sent Huo Zhizhen to attend.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals' Letter of Advice to Students to Resume Classes (II)</h3>
<p>We, the principals of the provincial schools, usually discuss and learn with you students, respecting each other. In terms of identity, we are teachers, and in terms of status, we are no less than fathers and brothers. As fathers and brothers, we should do our best to love you, and as teachers, we should take on the responsibility of guiding you. Now, for the sake of loving and guiding you students, we must give the following earnest advice:</p>
<p>First, the patriotism of young people is mostly pure and bright, which goes without saying. However, the true spirit of patriotism is like steam. It must be condensed, united, fulfilled, and strengthened in order to generate power and move forward. If it is used intentionally and released at any time, it may seem enthusiastic on the surface, but it is actually broad and loose and does not generate power. It cannot drive the engine and make it move forward rapidly. It can be said that Mencius said, "I am good at cultivating my magnanimous spirit. As for this spirit, it is most great and most strong. If it is nourished with integrity and without harm, it will fill the space between heaven and earth." The urgent task for you students is to cultivate and store your own magnanimous spirit, so that it is fulfilled and strong. Then, one becomes ten, ten becomes a thousand, a thousand becomes ten thousand, and even countless. Accumulate the countless magnanimous spirits of young people and transform them into a fulfilled, strong, most great and most strong force, which is hidden in a box and moved when the time comes. If it does not fly, it will fly to the sky. If it does not make a sound, it will shock the world. This is what it means.</p>
<p>Second, the foundation of saving the country lies in profound knowledge and moral principles. It is expected that one can study science diligently and invent bacteriology and silkworm disease science. France's increase in productivity is enough to compensate for war reparations. Edison of the United States, during the European War, devoted himself to inventions for military use, such as special shells, submarine telescopes, aircraft search methods, and submarine detectors, and finally defeated Germany, which had a world-shaking spirit. Recently, according to reports, our army and the Japanese army fought fiercely in Tianzhuangtai. The Japanese army used bombing aircraft to destroy the railway, preventing our armored vehicles from advancing and retreating freely, which resulted in setbacks. Our aircraft have often crashed in sea trials, resulting in broken bones and many deaths. How can we use them to fight? Such things show that students, for the future, must have the greatest effort, the most practical skills, and the newest inventions in order to talk about saving the country, resisting Japan, and overthrowing imperialism. Buried in research, desperately seeking new knowledge and new skills, and catching up with the world's culture is the time for students to strive.</p>
<p>Third, if the students resolve to save the country in the future, they must get rid of the bad habits of romantic, decadent, and lazy ways and replace them with the spirit of perseverance and hard work. According to our observations, among the bad habits of the students, laziness is the most deeply rooted and cannot be eradicated. They are usually afraid of studying hard, afraid of exercising, afraid of working, afraid of military training, and afraid of enduring hardship. It is the word laziness that harms them. Even in this wave of school closures, the number of those who are truly enthusiastic, righteous, unafraid of hardship, and engaged in saving the country is undoubtedly large. However, there are also many who take advantage of the opportunity to practice their hedonism and live freely. The word laziness harms young people and harms the country a lot. In the future, students must sharpen their minds, rise at the sound of the rooster, engage in sports in addition to their studies in order to train their bodies and cultivate their minds, intensify military training, truly regard themselves as soldiers, and practice enduring hardship and fighting, as Zeng Guofan said, "Knock out your teeth and swallow the blood." Only such people are worthy of saving the country and resisting Japan. Otherwise, if they speak of saving the country but only want to be comfortable, enjoy happiness, be a young master, and be greedy for petty gains, there is no such thing in the world. In short, having energy but no strength is not enough to save the country. Not learning and having no skills is not enough to save the country. Wanting to be free and comfortable and being unwilling to endure hardship is even more insufficient to save the country. Nurture your spirit and do not let it leak easily. Store your knowledge and strive to make it abundant. Exercise your body so that it can withstand wind, rain, frost, dew, hardship, and difficulty without fear or discouragement. The nation and the country will rely on it.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Association of Faculty and Staff from Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Established</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Association of Faculty and Staff from Secondary and Higher Education Institutions held its founding meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the public amusement park on the upper floor of the Provincial Public Education Hall. More than forty representatives from twenty schools attended. Yang Daoyuan was elected as the temporary chairman. After performing the necessary formalities, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the preparations. Then, the association's constitution was discussed and resolved. The name was decided to be the Hangzhou Temporary United Association of Faculty and Staff from Secondary and Higher Education Institutions (because more than ten faculty and staff from schools had not yet been able to participate due to school examinations, so the word "temporary" was added). All other articles were temporarily adopted, except that the number of directors was changed to seventeen and the membership fee will be amended at the next general meeting. The election of directors resulted in the election of seventeen people: Fang Zhichao, Xu Fangchu, Yang Daoyuan, Song Chongyi, Xiang Shiyuan, Shen Xianzhen, Zhu Husheng, Lu Dadao, Zhu Yiqing, Ye Hanzhang, Chen Chongran, Huang Shijin, Wang Zhenqiu, Luo Binren, Zhang Tingjie, Xing Xiping, and Yu Guozhen. There were fourteen proposals, but due to the lateness of the hour, it was resolved to hand them over to the board of directors.</p>

<h3>Telegram of the Shanghai University Students' Union</h3>
<p>Hoping that the National Public Will Automatically Organize to Overcome National Difficulties, the Shanghai University Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation sends a telegram saying: To the respected newspaper offices for public review by the national populace: Since September 18th, bad news has been frequently reported, causing alarm and repeated reports. All compatriots throughout the country are shocked and dismayed. The government bears the responsibility of defending the country and the heavy trust of the people. However, when the enemy comes, it does not resist; when the borders are threatened, it completely abandons them. During these hundred-plus days of national crisis, what has the government done? Apart from repeatedly declaring that it has final determination and measures, it only cries out to the League of Nations, demarcates Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and creates the idea of ​​joint management of Tianjin, causing a national sensation. Speaking of internal affairs, there is division and separation; speaking of diplomacy, there is loss of national sovereignty and power. It sings the high-sounding tune of serving the country and the people, but engages in actions that harm the country and the people. We, the young students, are in a state of danger and shock. Based on our patriotic sincerity, we have repeatedly petitioned the government to use force to resist Japan, and we are willing to be the backing. However, the government repeatedly uses the credibility of the League of Nations and the determination of the National Government as the only guarantee for recovering lost territory. It has not been adopted, and the patriotic movement has been wantonly destroyed. This time, students from various places went to Beijing to demonstrate, and their purpose was nothing more than to urge the government to unite and implement resistance against Japan. However, the government disregarded the students' enthusiasm, gave guidance and added reactionary labels, disregarded it brazenly, issued arrest orders, and inflicted beatings, with injuries and deaths along the way, and throwing them into the wilderness. We sincerely do not understand the government's intentions. Its high-handed methods dare not be applied to the enemy, but are applied to students who have no power. Alas, our young students failed to die gloriously on the battlefield of resisting Japan, but died unjustly in the dignified capital. Now that the national righteous debt unity has been promoted and achieved, and the new government has begun to realize it, pacifying internal affairs and resisting foreign aggression should be done to comfort the people's hopes. However, they are competing with each other to prove who is superior, forming a situation of division. The three gentlemen Hu, Wang, and Jiang have all indicated that they will go to Beijing. In the past, they monopolized dictatorship, but now they all stand idly by. Meanwhile, the violent Japanese have captured Jinzhou, and the foreign minister has changed twice, but there is still no policy toward Japan. The three northeastern provinces are almost completely lost, and they are now attacking Rehe in an attempt to seize Tianjin and Peiping, with a great tendency to annex the entire country. It seems that they are being slaughtered by others in this way, yet they are still humbly yielding. What is their intention? How can our compatriots not be wary and startled? The government cannot defend against insults and resist the enemy, and it even kills civilians and suppresses patriotic movements. The facts are there, and there is nothing to quibble about. For the sake of today's plan, if we want to save ourselves from danger and destruction, compatriots from all walks of life should unite and concentrate their will and strength. The violent Japanese can subdue our government, but they can never subdue our people. The government can cruelly kill young people, but it can never kill all young people. At this critical moment of survival, we hope that the national populace will automatically organize, overcome national difficulties together, recover lost territory, uphold the spirit of fearlessness, carry out the national salvation movement, and resolutely resist governments that harm the country and oppress the people. We sincerely hope that all sectors will unanimously advocate for early realization, drive out the Japanese pirates, and return our mountains and rivers. The telegram is not to be expected, respectfully, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Shanghai University Students bowed respectfully.</p>
<h3>Petition Situation of the Delegation of Middle School Students Going to Beijing</h3>
<p>Petition to the Jiangsu Local Court</p>
<p>The representative, Zeng Guangchi, has been released</p>
<p>The delegation of middle school students going to Beijing to petition wired Xinsheng News Agency from the Executive Yuan in Beijing yesterday, reporting on the situation of petitioning for the release of the representative from Peiping, Zeng Guangchi, etc. The original telegram stated: On the afternoon of the 12th, at 2:00 PM, when they arrived at the gate of the Jiangning Local Court, the gatekeepers stopped them. After negotiations, they were granted access to the reception room, where they were received by the prosecutor. He said that Beida students must have a substantial guarantor to be released. This is a legal procedure and must be followed. Ms. Sun, the representative of the Peiping Anti-Japanese Association, offered an out-of-town guarantee. This delegation (i.e., the delegation of middle school students going to Beijing) immediately decided to return to the court in the name of this delegation to see the prosecutor, but they were denied access. The representatives strictly guarded each door, preventing people from entering and exiting, declaring that they would not leave the court unless the Beida students were released. At 12:00 midnight, the Peiping representative finally found a guarantor, but there were no responsible persons in the court. They searched separately and roused a judge from a bedroom, presented the guarantee, and then he agreed to release him. The five representatives waited quietly until 3:00 AM (13th). Beida student Zeng Guangchi was released from prison. Zeng wore a blue long gown and had a smile on his face. His hair was very long. In the court, he thanked the representatives, saying that he was grateful for their assistance and regained his freedom. He expressed his thanks and hoped that they would identify clear goals and work hard on the anti-Japanese cause in the future. Then, the students cheered and returned to the Executive Yuan. The Beida representative also stayed overnight at the Executive Yuan that evening. It was already 4:00 AM. On the night of the 13th, all thirteen released Beida students went to the Executive Yuan to express their gratitude. Ms. Sun, the representative of the Peiping Anti-Japanese Association, delivered a speech. They dispersed at 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jin Da Petitioning Students Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>Nanjing Jinling University students, after discussing abandoning classes, went to Shanghai and Hong Kong to urge Wang, Jiang, and Hu to go to Beijing to take charge of the government. Some arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and more arrived last night, totaling more than 500. It is now known that they are temporarily residing at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui. According to students from the school, after all the students arrive, they will visit Wang at the hospital tomorrow or the day after. They have also contacted the municipal government to prepare a ship to go to Fenghua to urge Mr. Jiang. After returning to Shanghai, they will take a boat to Hong Kong to visit Hu.</p>
<h3>Qingxin Girls' Middle School Resumption Dispute</h3>
<p>The Middle School Federation Intervenes, Still Strikes Immediately</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The General Strike Picket Team of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Middle School Students in this city, because a member school, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, violated the general strike agreement and resumed classes on its own, sent personnel to persuade them on the day, but to no avail. A misunderstanding occurred in the language between the two parties, and a slight conflict arose. After receiving the report, the team immediately convened a meeting and decided to take final measures. Yesterday afternoon, representatives were dispatched to lead hundreds of volunteer soldiers from more than a dozen schools to surround the school, and the situation was turbulent. They questioned the school's Anti-Japanese Association. Subsequently, the school sent four representatives to explain to the team's representatives, stating that the resumption of classes on their own was due to various difficulties. The two sides discussed for three hours, each sticking to their own opinions, and still could not resolve the issue. The situation was reported to Chief Jin of the Third Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who feared causing trouble, and quickly took the police to mediate. As a result, the Qingxin Middle School representative agreed to temporarily suspend classes from tomorrow, and wrote to the Middle School Federation to request a general representative meeting to resolve the issue. The picket team felt satisfied and returned to the meeting at 4:00 PM to report.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Meets Representatives of Beijing and Hangzhou Students Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sends Secretaries to Meet Separately, Indicates He Will Go to Beijing Once Recovered</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei is ill in the hospital and has been asked to rest. Therefore, he has not met with any guests. The Jinling University students from the provincial capital, who urged Wang, Jiang, and Hu to go to Beijing as a group, and the Hangzhou Federation of Higher Education Associations' petitioning delegation arrived in Shanghai from Beijing one after another to visit Wang's residence and urge him to go to Beijing to preside over the party and state's major offensive. Wang was unable to see them in person, so yesterday (the 14th) at 10:00 AM, he sent his secretary, Zeng Zhongming, to Jiaotong University to meet with the Jinling University students. At 3:00 PM, he sent his secretary, Peng Xuepei, to Shanghai Middle School to meet with the Hangzhou students, reporting that Wang would go to Beijing as soon as his illness improved, to live up to the wishes of the patriotic youth. The Jinling University students then went to Xujiahui Station at 1:00 PM in the afternoon to take a train to Hangzhou to urge Jiang. The Hangzhou middle school students also left Shanghai at 4:30 PM in the afternoon to go to urge Jiang.</p>
<h3>Middle School Anti-Japanese Associations Telegram Urging Wang, Jiang, and Hu to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Nation is in Peril, and the Masses are Panicked</p>
<p>Go to Beijing as Soon as Possible to Save the Critical Situation</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Middle School Students in this city urgently telegraphed Wang Jingwei in Shanghai, Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong, and Chiang Kai-shek in Fenghua, saying, (titles omitted) "The violent Japanese are invading with increasing intensity, and the Chinese nation is frequently on the verge of peril. The people of the whole country are looking forward to the government officials to unanimously abandon their prejudices, make up for the difficulties of the times. Unexpectedly, since the establishment of the unified government, we have not yet seen you gentlemen resolutely enter Beijing, unite sincerely, and jointly overcome national difficulties, resulting in the central government being empty, and all affairs being suspended. All internal and external problems still have no concrete solutions, and the masses are in panic, at a loss. Therefore, we once again urge you to enter Beijing with illness, and jointly save the critical situation. If it benefits the country, the people of the country will do their best to support you. Please look forward to it." It is also heard that the Association is scheduled to hold its 17th emergency representative meeting at Jingye Middle School at 1:00 PM this afternoon (the 15th) to discuss important issues. It has already sent notices to all schools, recommending two representatives to attend on time. At the same time, the Shanghai Middle School Students' General Strike Picket Team will hold its third second session of the Team Affairs Meeting.</p>
<h3>Middle School Federation Petitions for Intensified Military Training for Students</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Middle School Students in this city believes that the violent Japanese invasion is becoming more and more urgent, and the national situation is extremely critical, while the students' military training has become an ending, which is very painful. Yesterday, it specially petitioned the Training Supervisor Department to promptly urge all schools to intensify efforts to achieve results. The original state is recorded as follows: "To promote strict implementation of two hours of military training per day by the school authorities, today's foreign insults are approaching day by day, and the country is changing color. The Japanese pirates are deeply involved, and the country is dying day by day. Military training is urgent and cannot be delayed. Your department, in view of this, selects talents and sends them to various regions to be responsible for training, which is comforting. However, the training of various schools does not comply with the regulations of the clear orders, and it is perfunctory and sloppy. It lacks both the expression of spirit and the adequacy of time. There are often those who implement training and dismiss them in less than an hour. If this continues, how can it be effective, and how can it save the country? The responsibility of your department lies in this, and it should not be allowed to be corrupt without urging. Our Association is concerned and cannot sit idly by. I specially request your department to promptly urge the school authorities to strictly enforce the military training from the next semester and implement the two-hour regulation every day. Youth is fortunate, and the country is fortunate."</p>

From now on, I hope that you, the Director, will pay close attention, resolutely reform. Xiang Weixian, the head of the Jinshan Education Bureau, has been in office for four years, and he is engaged in private business and domineering. It cannot be described to the extreme. When Chief Chen was in charge, local people and alumni in Shanghai filed many complaints. Xiang Mou even took the initiative to exercise officials in the Education Department and secretly confiscated the submission. The means were so bad. I will submit it to you, the Director, again. Please uphold justice and send personnel with Wancheng to Jinshan to investigate immediately and remove and punish Wei Xian. If you, the Director, also ignore my Jinshan Education, then the reform of my Jinshan Education is hopeless. Wancheng, etc., are determined to sit and wait for the achievement of the purpose of removing Xiang and rectify the education of the homeland. Wancheng, etc., have no choice. So and so."</p>

<h3>Letter from Xu Peihuang</h3>
<p>Denies Sponsoring the Launch of the Film Education Association</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Xu Peihuang said: "Dear Sir, I have read the education news column in your newspaper on January 14, which states that I am one of the sponsors of the launch of the China Film Education Association. I have always advocated that film education has the function of subtly influencing social customs. This is not only the case after Baron Gentili of Italy came to Shanghai. However, the report lists my name as a sponsor of the launch of the Film Education Association, which is not the case. I hope you will publish my letter to acknowledge this." Sincerely, Xu Peihuang, January 14.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Reading the Declaration of Desperation of the Righteous Volunteer Army in Jinxi</h3>
<p>A telegram from Shanhai Pass on the 10th said that the 6th, 7th, and 8th brigades of the Righteous Volunteer Army in Jinxi and the front-line junior officers of the Northeast Army jointly issued a declaration of desperation, which was sent to Yuguan by a special person from Honglu Mountain. The last paragraph of the declaration says:</p>
<p>"Our army is in the midst of the chaotic mountains around Jinxi and has entered the period of hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese. The intensity of their artillery fire and the number of our casualties are many times greater than those in the trenches of Dahuying. The number of enemies killed is also unprecedented. Knowing that the Japanese reinforcements have now encircled us in droves, our Righteous Volunteer Army and our defeated troops of the army have only a glimmer of hope and will never leave Jinzhou behind. We hope that the central government will quickly decide on a peace or war plan, and that the leaders of all parties will quickly put aside their struggles. If this is the case, even if our four thousand children in the Northeast are all martyred within a day or two, we should smile in the afterlife without regret..."</p>
<p>After reading this declaration dyed in the blood of four thousand righteous men in the Northeast, if we do not abandon our selfish views and go to the national crisis together, then we are truly heartless people.</p>
<p>These four thousand people do not have to die. If they are going to die, then they die for Rong Zhen, who retreated from the battle, for Zhang Xueliang, who did not resist, and for the central government, which talks about cooperation but does not go to the national crisis. They are going to die for their country, and this is their final question:</p>
<p>"Today we say cooperation:</p>
<p>Yesterday we said cooperation:</p>
<p>But there is no cooperation,</p>
<p>The Northeast is missing a corner!</p>
<p>The Northeast is missing a corner,</p>
<p>Cooperation or no cooperation?</p>
<p>Brother says unification,</p>
<p>If there is no unification,</p>
<p>Half of the country will be gone!</p>
<p>Half of the country will be gone,</p>
<p>Unification or no unification?"</p>
<h3>Dragon Colt</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>In ancient times, King Mu of Zhou had eight steeds. They had the swiftness of chasing the wind and lightning. A Tang dynasty historical poem had a line that said, "The eight steeds travel 30,000 miles a day, why did King Mu have to come again?" This refers to this. When I was young, I liked to ride horses and test swords, and I galloped with the young men in the red dust and purple alleys to gamble for victory. At the same time, fast horses were popular at sea. One Thousand Red, Smoked Jujube, and Rolling Dragon of the Dong family in Huzhou were the most famous. Every time I rode alongside them, I could not catch up. I secretly sighed that the dragon colt mentioned in ancient times was probably like this. Qiao Zhucun, from Pu, is already seventy years old. He likes to talk about his youth. I occasionally chatted with him around the stove, and he told me about the dragon colt of the Red Goat Era. He had witnessed it flying. During the end of the Qing Dynasty and the Xianfeng period, the Taiping Rebellion disturbed Jiangsu and Zhejiang and occupied Jiangning. Only a corner of Shanghai in Jiangsu Province was protected by foreigners, leaving a piece of clean land. Xue Huan, the governor of Jiangsu, was stationed here. The various prefectures and counties without land gathered and relied on him. They spent their days chasing after his footmen and handbills. At that time, there was a certain prefect of Zhenjiang Prefecture, a banner man, who was a noble of the royal family. He kept dozens of horses. There were eight steeds in the stable, all of which had the reputation of traveling a thousand miles a day. Qiao heard about it and became curious. He went to see the horse. He only saw a horse tied to the trough, with miscellaneous hair. Its four hooves were like rafters. Its appearance was quite dull. He suspected that he had been deceived. He asked the groom, who said, "This is a dragon colt. If you don't believe me, please come and watch it in the early morning. You will be able to see its ability to fly." The next morning, Qiao went early in the morning to wait on the side of the gate. (The gate of the governor's office is the Yamen of the Daotai) Three or four horses were tied to the stone lions. The so-called dragon colt was also among them. Before long, he suddenly saw an official holding a command arrow and coming out. He climbed onto the saddle and mounted the horse. He walked slowly out of the West Gate. Qiao immediately called a messenger to ride a horse and follow him. By the time he reached the wilderness, he whipped his horse and galloped. He only saw the hooves flipping and dust rising. In an instant, he was gone. After a while, the sound of bells rang. The horse had already returned. According to him, he went to scout the traces of the bandits. It only took ten minutes to gallop dozens of miles. The cavalry of the Taiping bandits could not catch up. Its speed was like this. It can be seen that the title of dragon colt is indeed not a false reputation. It is a pity that there is no Bole in the world, and he was born at the wrong time.</p>
<h3>The Phrase "Stacks of Bloodstained Clothes" Which Cannot Be Confirmed</h3>
<p>— Yandang Student</p>
<p>Since the Northeast was invaded and occupied by the violent Japanese, student organizations have formed petition groups to ask the government to recover the lost territory and send troops immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to Peiping and Jinan, the petition groups are mostly composed of students from Shanghai. They went to Beijing in droves, with pure sincerity and indignant actions. They were forced to do so, not because they liked to be in power. Unfortunately, they clashed with the military police. It was not enough to stand out in the cold and snowy night all night. They were also subjected to prisoner abuse and sent to Xiaolingwei for placement. Moreover, rumors spread on the road that there were stacks of bloodstained clothes. The truth was half believed and half doubted, and there was no way to confirm it. Recently, I saw a poem made by a teacher of a certain school, which focused on the phrase "stacks of bloodstained clothes" which cannot be confirmed. I recorded it to introduce it to the readers. It is also a doubtful case in the voice of national disaster. The poem says: "The cold wind is rustling, the wind is fierce, the blood of ten thousand people is spraying on their chests. The youth are loyal and brave and die in vain. They do not die in the border city but die in the capital. They formed a team to petition to enter the capital. The rain and snow fell all night. The officials refused to see them. The valiant soldiers came to face the enemy. The bayonets were sharp and raised together. The unarmed youth all retreated. The painful words came and were shocking and doubtful. The stacks of bloodstained clothes were all crimson. If they fell into the water and died, they would still get a coffin. The fierce front destroyed them and it was difficult to find their corpses. The world should not have this kind of thing. Who can measure the shock and doubt? The strong enemies are gathering like hedgehogs in the Northeast. They snore and allow others to sleep on the couch. The anxiety is like burning to the youth. Who will fight and kill the thieves? Except for the hero General Ma, the rest have all disappeared and are hiding. The students petitioning are said to be out of position. The soldiers retreat and lose their jobs first. Alas, the youth are not afraid to die on the battlefield. Their corpses are not wrapped in horsehide. Are the stacks of bloodstained clothes true or false? I heard it as if the doubt could not be resolved. The soul is ethereal and cannot be summoned. If it is true, who will be cleared of the injustice?"</p>
<h3>瀛海談屑</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>The Englishman, Mr. Lambert, who was an extraordinarily large man, has passed away. His weight reached over one thousand tons. He lived in Stamford. The circumference of his foot was more than three feet. The circumference of his waist was nine feet and four inches. He could sometimes jump to a height of over seven feet and often walked between London and Woolwich. He could also carry two adults on his back and swim in the water. Upon his death, he hired carpenters to make a large coffin for him, using elm wood that was one hundred and twelve feet long, six feet and four inches long, four feet and four inches wide, and two feet and four inches deep. Twenty porters carried this large coffin out of his house. When the coffin was placed on wheels, even the walls of the house shook and collapsed. Therefore, the road to the cemetery was specially constructed with a slope to facilitate the transportation of the coffin. He can truly be considered the largest man in world history.</p>
<p>A woman in London, England, broke the marriage record by marrying three hundred times. A single woman returning home stated that she had worn the new bridal gown used for marriage three hundred times. She is now displaying her wedding dress at the International Fashion Exposition to showcase its beauty. The wedding wreaths are almost like those in a flower shop. The number of bridesmaids hired for the weddings totaled the population of both London and York. She said, "I still wear fashionable wedding dresses because wearing them now is less awkward than when I got married. I used to love listening to wedding songs, but now I find them annoying. When I marry my three hundred and first husband in the future, I don't want to wear a wedding dress again and want to abolish rituals such as music and flower baskets."</p>
<h3>關於巴黎最近藝壇的一封信（下）</h3>
<p>— 劉抗</p>
<p>It is heard that in the near future, there are plans to first build a large building with studios, bedrooms, kitchens, etc., to accommodate impoverished artists at low cost or free of charge, to reduce their burden of living and allow them to focus on their research without any distractions. The goodness of this intention and the speed of its implementation are truly enviable!</p>
<p>Soon, a new Salon will appear. Its organizational principles are no different from others, but its purpose is different. The art displayed in this Salon will be based on the exchange of items or things that the exhibitors need or like, rather than money. It can be said to be a return to primitive bartering.</p>
<p>Next spring, a French landscape exhibition will be held at the Petit Palais, showcasing works from Corot to Cézanne. All the artists from the Barbizon school, such as Corot, Millet, Rousseau, Dupré, Diaz, Troyon, and Daubigny; realists like Courbet; Impressionists like Monet, Degas, Renoir, Sisley, Pissarro, and Guillaumin; and later artists like Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat will be represented. Efforts are being made to gather works from museums and major collectors around the world and exhibit them in one room. In 1925, there was a landscape exhibition from Poussin to Corot, which caused a sensation and attracted the attention of the general public and those engaged in providing for them. This time, the collection of works by realists and Impressionists, and the continuation of the study of nature from both scientific and anti-scientific perspectives, will be fully explored, making it extremely interesting. The grand occasion can be anticipated. However, I don't know if I will be able to feast my eyes on it, as my situation has become increasingly difficult and my finances have been severely hit. I may have to pack up and return home! If Mr. Hao's Lyon affair fails, I will set off to leave France in January or February of next year. I will purchase and collect A. Besnard's works when I enter the city and send them to you as soon as possible. When it comes to national affairs, everyone is disheartened. Military men and politicians exploit the people's wealth in peacetime and retreat and beg for mercy when something happens. This defeatist mentality is a great disgrace to our nation. If we want the Republic of China to stand in modern times, we must first revive the national spirit. Where does the national spirit reside? It is in literature and art. The master's vision is far-reaching, advocating the Chinese literary and artistic renaissance movement. I sincerely urge it to succeed!</p>
<h3>黑白影展觀光記</h3>
<p>— 苕狂</p>
<p>The Black and White Photography Society, organized by famous photographers such as Chen Chuanlin, Chen Zhude, Wu Zhongxing, Lu Shifu, and Nie Guangdi, specially gathered the works of its members at the beginning of this year, totaling 180 pieces, and held an exhibition on the third floor of the Times Building to promote the art. The exhibition was originally scheduled for three days but was extended for another day. I also took some time off during my vacation to visit and appreciate the works. I felt that there was one point that deserved special attention: the overall quality of the works was consistently high, with every piece exceeding the average level. This shows the concentration of talent in the society and the positive phenomenon of the popularization of photography today.</p>
<p>As far as my personal vision is concerned, I especially like the following pieces: (1) Wu Zhongxing's "Mad Crow," which is sparse, well-organized, and close to painting. (2) Fu Naowu's "Torrent," which is extremely surging and makes people feel awe-inspiring. (3) Chen Chuanlin's "Corner of the Racecourse," which embodies meticulousness in complexity and is clear at a glance. It shows that the artist knows the art of shrinking the earth. (4) Chen Zhude's "Ceiling," which is very much like a pattern painting and is truly ingenious. (5) Nie Guangdi's "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," which is innovative in its symbolism and shocking to the eye. I hope that my compatriots will be inspired by it. In addition, among the members, Dr. Lu Shifu's works are particularly numerous and worth appreciating, especially the "Maidservant," which has the meaning of a nude beauty painting.</p>
<p>It is also heard that, except for the items for sale, all the proceeds from the first sale of each exhibit will be donated to relieve the victims of the flood. Their eagerness to help those in need is commendable. (Thank you)</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（十）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>Chapter Two: A Heartbreaking Message Delivered to a Kind Teacher Amidst Laughter; A Home Devastated by Robbery, with Lonely Pity for a Friend; A Spring-Like Atmosphere in a Lodging with Delightful Conversation</p>
<p>Liang Xiaoyun, filled with joy, rushed to the door taking three steps as two, expecting to be visited by the high-achieving college student, An Yutian. However, instead of An Yutian, a man with a Japanese-style mustache, dressed in a Western suit, entered. It was clear that An Yutian did not look like this. After entering, the man heavily threw a thick foreign book he was holding onto the table with a loud thud, jolting Liang Xiaoyun's dreamy mind awake. She focused her eyes on the man and recognized him as the contracted English teacher, Wei Zhuomou. Wei Zhuomou was short in stature and very good at humor, somewhat resembling Charlie Chaplin. He was originally an English lecturer at the university, but due to his sociable nature, he met Liang Xiaoyun at a dance hall and became her private English tutor. Considering it a friendly favor, he was particularly diligent in this part-time job. Every day, between two and three in the afternoon, he would arrive on time regardless of the weather, never absent or late without a good reason, more diligent than his work at the university. Today, after entering and putting down the book, he immediately approached Liang Xiaoyun with a smile, shook her hand, and carefully examined her face and body. Then, with a heron-like smile, he asked, "Did you stay up late again last night? What did you do for entertainment? You don't seem very energetic today." Liang Xiaoyun smiled lazily, "Just those boring entertainments, making me feel so tired. I'm really getting tired of those meaningless social obligations." Wei Zhuomou continued to smile, "Since you're not feeling well, maybe we should skip today's English lesson?" Liang Xiaoyun thought for a moment and said, "I'd be bored anyway. We can just play around with a lesson." Wei Zhuomou quickly said, "That makes sense. We'll just play around. If you don't like it, we'll stop immediately. I'm a very polite teacher to my students. I'm afraid of annoying the students, or they'll cut off my job, and where else can I find such a good place and good student?" After speaking, he quickly picked up the foreign book, took two steps forward, and walked to a small door on the west side of the room. He bowed respectfully and gestured with his hand politely, saying, "Student Miss, please go to the study." Liang Xiaoyun couldn't help but cover her mouth and giggle at his actions. She glanced at the teacher and said, "What are you doing? How can a teacher be so mischievous with his student?" Wei Zhuomou still maintained his half-smiling, half-serious, comical face, bending over, waving his hand, and standing motionless by the door, not saying another word. Liang Xiaoyun couldn't resist him and could only sway her willow waist and lotus steps, laughing like a flower trembling wildly in the light breeze. She lowered her head and rushed into the study in the west wing. Wei Zhuomou followed behind in a serious and respectful manner, like a dutiful servant.</p>

<h3>Significant Fluctuations in Gold Bar Bidding</h3>
<p>The market conditions were erratic, ultimately falling by four taels. The gold bar bidding yesterday fluctuated and fell, with significant volatility. The market shifted erratically, advancing and retreating without a fixed pattern. The daily difference amounted to fifteen or sixteen taels, a fluctuation not seen for many days. The final result was a drop of about four taels, leaving traders uncertain and erratic. It initially opened higher, reportedly due to falling silver market prices, subsequently reaching 690 taels. Later, foreign exchange turned negative, with more selling pressure, causing the gold price to depreciate by four or five taels. The selling pressure intensified, mainly due to the weakening of the US dollar. Dealers tended to sell, pushing the price from $13.4375 to $13.625. Consequently, market sentiment weakened, plunging below 80 taels. Eventually, the market seemed to stabilize as sellers rushed to cover their positions, leading the exchange to set a dual closing price.</p>
<p>Opening with a rise of five taels: The market opened five taels higher at 687.5 taels. The price of both large silver bars and US silver coins fell by one-eighth.

Market sentiment deteriorated. Shortly after, Maihang absorbed April at $33.5625, and Zhenjin absorbed March at $33.5. Additionally, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, Runchangyu, and others all bought, pushing the price upwards. By 3:30, it was at 77 taels, 5 qian, and 9 qian. However, with retail sellers entering, it retreated to around 75 taels. At 4:00, a sudden advantage emerged as Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, Heng Yu, Yuanda Yong, and others rushed to buy, pushing the price up by four taels in half an hour, reaching 78 taels, 6 qian, by the closing time of 4:30, a slight decrease of 3 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day.

<h3>公債停拍後之滬金融界</h3>
<h3>Shanghai's Financial Circles After the Suspension of Public Bond Auctions</h3>
<p>Funds from Various Regions Arrive in Shanghai, and the Money Market is Not Expected to Be Tight. The Principal and Interest on Treasury Bonds Will Be Paid as Scheduled at the End of the Month.</p>
<p>The recent changes in the financial world, due to the entanglement of public bonds, have often led to unfortunate incidents. A few days ago, the securities exchange was rumored to be suspending the right to auction due to the issue of various government authorities intercepting customs and salt tax revenues, causing a significant shock to the silver and money industries. The influx of silver dollars was indescribable. Subsequently, the industry devised methods to remedy the situation, allowing it to turn danger into safety. The following is a summary of the observations made. (1) The monthly principal and interest payments for various public bonds and securities amount to approximately 15 to 16 million silver dollars. There is a guaranteed amount of 6 million silver dollars that can be obtained on time. Banks plan to temporarily set aside 5 million silver dollars, leaving a shortfall of 3 to 4 million silver dollars. This will be supplemented by transfers from the salt surplus and related items. Therefore, the payment of interest and principal for this month can still be carried out as usual. (2) The financial industry has the closing period at the end of January of the lunar calendar, for the 20th year, for consolidating all transactions and accounts, resulting in strong capital. Even if unfortunate events occur, there is actually no panic. (3) In order to repay debts owed to Shanghai businesses, customers from various regions have been sending large quantities of cash to Shanghai. The available funds in the market are sufficient for distribution, avoiding the previous tight money situation. (4) Various stores outside are now implicitly suspending operations, making no funds available, so there are only surpluses, and no empty accounts. From this perspective, it is possible that the current major crisis will be safely overcome.</p>

<p>The yarn market was quiet, with the potential to rise, but due to the unfavorable situation and the suspension of the securities market, market sentiment was depressed. Retail investors tended to sell, fortunately, the underlying inventory was not large. Deliveries this month were not strong, and the market could still support the outlook.</p>
<p>The price of standard yarn increased by 4 qian. The standard yarn market opened with slightly firm sentiment due to rising US cotton prices. The price of all months increased by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment was slightly weak due to the unfavorable overall situation, and the price of each month decreased by 1-2 qian. Total transactions were 8,100 bales. According to investigations, Shen Ji sold 350 bales, Guangfeng 400 bales, and Hengchang 400 bales. Mingde bought 600 bales, Hengyi 600 bales, and Taixing 500 bales.</p>
<p>The closing prices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Cotton Remains Steady</h3>
<p>But Lacks Strong Development</p>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. However, U.S. cotton is trending upwards, which has somewhat strengthened confidence. Moreover, India's intention to collect [cotton] is firm, and Indian cotton market prices are relatively high, leading to some psychological expectation of higher prices. Actual sales in the market have been slightly active recently, but large-scale transactions are still lacking. Nevertheless, supplies from various sources remain limited, while a relatively large amount of Tongzhou cotton has arrived. The future trend is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard [Cotton] Slightly Better: Hankou Standard [Cotton] opened in the morning market with U.S. cotton rising, strengthening confidence. Prices for all months rose by 20 cash [per bale], but fell by 5 fen to 15 fen in the afternoon. Total transactions for the day amounted to 47,000 bales. A review shows that Shenchang sold 2,600 bales, and others sold 3,100 bales; Ruiyuan 1,700 bales, Zeng Yifeng 1,300 bales, Houfeng 1,600 bales. Hengyi bought 3,400 bales, Gongtai 1,700 bales, Mingde 2,000 bales, Changfeng 2,800 bales, and Tianlong 1,100 bales. The domestic prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yao cotton: 200 bales arrived; no spot cotton transactions; no new positions opened. It is reported that 200 bales of Yao cotton arrived.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Steps Upward, English Cotton Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially firm due to a lack of sellers. Later, due to strong Wall Street activity and reactive buying, it gradually rose. Futures rose by 13 to 16 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. English cotton futures fell by 2 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegraphic report is on the left (dated the 13th).</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Transitions from Brisk Sales to Sluggishness</h3>
<p>In southern Shanghai yesterday, the inventory of river rice remained high, with some supplies arriving. As the end of the lunar month is approaching, both parties are customarily settling accounts, resulting in quiet sales. Prices of various types of rice fluctuated slightly. Ordinary early glutinous rice fell by half a corner, while early rice [prices] were firm. Transactions of Luyang rice were scarce, also down by 5 fen. Arrivals of Tong grain decreased gradually, and the situation continues to weaken. There are approximately 70 boats in the river, each carrying an average of 110 shi of rice, totaling about 7,700 shi.</p>
<p>Transactions at Xinzha were not favorable. Arrivals of Changshu and northern rice were limited. Sand barges handled nearly 1,000 shi. Due to the approaching end of the lunar month, retail sales were limited. Over ten boats of [early] rice arrived, but market sales were active, and prices were close to one corner [per shi]. Arrivals of Jinlu late rice were very few, and the trend is firm. Inferior quality rice was a few fen lower. There was little change in foreign rice.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice Sales Active</h3>
<p>Futures Still Being Dumped by Foreign Firms</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw good sales locally, which attracted merchants to procure goods, resulting in an improved market. Merchants from Hankou and the northern ports procured small-grain rice, demonstrating activity. Merchants procured a total of 2,000 bags of small-grain transit rice at a price of 9 yuan and 56 jiao. Local sales to Daokou were at 9 yuan and 45 jiao per bag. Several hundred tons of second-hand rice, including No. 1 West [rice] and small-grain rice, were resold. New transactions included 1,300 tons of March small-grain rice dumped by Chengquan and Anli at a bargain price of 4 liang and 55 qian, and 4,000 tons of April [rice] at 4 liang and 62 fen to 4 liang and 60 qian, all of which were absorbed by the local market. Arrivals of ke xian [rice] were few, stabilizing the market. The local market sold 400 bags of newly arrived Taizhou white rice at 11 yuan and 3 jiao, and 200 bags of Taizhou rough rice at 11 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Keep Releasing Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices turn weak and fall in the morning and afternoon sessions. In the morning, due to concerns about potential major changes in the domestic situation, many people rushed to sell their holdings, causing prices for all months to decline. By the afternoon session, the current month remained stable, but the forward months were impacted by the release of stocks by flour mills, although the quantity was not large. This caused prices to fall again slightly. Looking at the future trend, if the mills continue to release stocks, the market may have difficulty stabilizing. As a result, the current month fell by 12.5 fen compared to the previous day, February fell by 2.25 fen, March to May each fell by 1.7 fen, and June fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Fluctuates Greatly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw prices slightly stabilize after the morning opening due to a rise of about one corner in foreign wheat quotes. However, trading was very quiet with minimal price fluctuations. Trading became more active in the afternoon opening, and the market was slightly affected by the renewed weakness in the flour market. However, selling was very limited, so the decline was limited. Observing the future trend, if there are no major changes in foreign wheat prices, the market may temporarily stabilize. As a result, January to March each rose by 1 fen, April was down by 1.5 fen, and May and June saw no change.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Markets Weaker</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports from production areas stated that the current price of Cuban raw sugar was 1.15625. New York sugar futures were priced at 1.07 for March, 1.10 for May, 1.21 for September, and 1.27 for December, down one point from the previous report. Spot and futures prices for Javanese sugar remained unchanged. Transactions in the association's market were sluggish. The transaction price for 24 grade Dutch raw and white sugar was 9 liang and 52.5 qian, but buying interest remained sluggish and the trend was weak. Maoniu white sugar [priced at] 9 liang and 60 qian, 20 grade medium white sugar [priced at] 9 liang and 52.5 to 55 qian. Inventories were not high, and the market was relatively stable. Taikoo refined [sugar] continued to arrive, and market sentiment was slightly weak. B mark [sugar] prices declined, with transaction prices at 12 liang and 10 qian, HX mark [sugar] at 11 liang and 75 qian, and HM mark [sugar] at 10 liang and 45 qian. Both buying and selling were slow, but the market remained stable. On the price board, Bingchanghao offered over 1,000 bags of spot raw and white sugar at 9 liang and 55 qian per yuan. Brokers' interest in purchasing remained active. If these are sold, the market will be quite stable.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Sun-Dried Longan Market Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Arrivals of sun-dried longan were scarce recently, so dealers seized the opportunity to be active. Transactions have been occurring every day, with prices rising by about one or two liang compared to the lowest price. Better quality goods are close to 60 liang, but there is no stock of excellent color [longans]. Slightly more top-grade Ma Yuan longan has been transported, and the initial price was 95 liang. The market may need to increase further, as inventory is low.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Still Facing Difficulties</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm silk market in this port still lacks the possibility of a turnaround. European firms, noting the sluggish sales of raw silk overseas and declining silk prices, are trying to squeeze [profits from] yellow and white silk filatures. However, their offered prices remain low, making it difficult for Chinese silk merchants to sell. Yesterday, Dachang and others imported 30 bales of white dried silk, and Meida imported 10 bales of yellow coarse silk, but prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>Special Zhenmei Tea Sales to Europe Revive</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market saw a revival of European sales for high-grade Tunxi Special Zhenmei tea. British firm Xiehe Foreign Firm has received a request from Africa and has started procuring [tea]. Over 100 boxes have been agreed upon in the city, with sales at 120 to 130 liang. Formal sales are expected to begin within one or two days. There have been no continued transactions for other mid- to low-grade teas.</p>
<h3>Over 9,000 Boxes of Red and Green Tea Still in Stock</h3>
<p>After recent procurement by British and French firms, the remaining inventory of red and green tea for export by foreign firms is becoming increasingly depleted. A recent survey of the city shows that 3,306 boxes of red tea, 4,594 boxes of Luchaung green tea, and 1,249 boxes of native green tea remain, totaling 9,149 boxes.</p>
<h3>Hardware: 300-400 Bundles of New Iron Wire Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to foreign firms, new iron wire, which has been out of stock for many days, arrived yesterday in 300-400 bundles and was unloaded at the Gonghexiang warehouse. Customers procuring this product were very enthusiastic upon hearing this news. It is reported that industry peers have offered over 100 bundles at a price of 13 liang and 25 qian per dan for sizes 16 to 20, and 14 liang and 25 qian for sizes 21 to 25, which is a rise of one or two qian compared to previous prices.</p>
<h3>Over 1,000 Dan of Pig Lead Sold</h3>
<p>The pig lead business in tea shops exploded yesterday, resulting in the sale of over 1,000 dan. However, the market trend was declining due to the imminent end of the year, with shops eager to sell. The current market price is 13 liang and 80 qian per dan, which is down by two qian from before.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Shanghai Price Index for December of the 20th Year</h3>
<p>The National Tariff Commission recently released a brief announcement on Shanghai's price index, stating that the Shanghai retail price index for December of the 20th year was 121.8, the export price index was 101.2, and the import price index was 138.9. Continuing the decline of the previous month, the index continued to fall. Since the Japanese military invasion and occupation of the Northeast provinces, with no diplomatic solutions yet, political unrest, extremely tight monetary conditions, and commercial stagnation have been the main reasons for the decline in the index. The extended foreign exchange market in the current month has slightly reduced the cost of foreign goods.</p>
<p>This is also related. The various categories of retail price indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Category Year December of the 20th Year November of the 20th Year December of the 19th Year</p>

<p>The National Crisis Relief Association Asks the Government to Decide on a Grand Plan</p>
<p>Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Return Political Power to the Entire People</p>
<p>The National Crisis Relief Association telegraphed all parties, stating: Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, Vice President Chen, Minister He, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek of Fenghua, Mr. Wang Jingwei of Shanghai, Mr. Feng Huanzhang, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Yan Baichuan of Taiyuan, Mr. You Zhantang of Guangzhou, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Bai Jiansheng, Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Beiping, are all informed that recently, the brutal Japanese invaded Jinzhou and advanced deeply. Volunteer troops outside the customs have risen up to kill the enemy. The United States has also issued a serious protest. However, our defending troops retreated without a fight. National generals were suspicious and selfish. The so-called central government is even more elusive. You, as leaders of the party and the country, are scattered and complacent, treating [the situation] as if it were Qin and Yue. The dangerous signs of national subjugation are appearing all at once. What else is there to say? However, we, the people, for the sake of urgent public service and national salvation, must still offer the most sincere advice to you. The country is a public instrument for 400 million people. The Kuomintang promotes party rule, but it is definitely not willing to be subjugated. If, even today, you still believe that the entire responsibility for national salvation can be shouldered by one party, then please remove everything, immediately gather in the capital, take on the responsibility of national defense, unite the entire nation for total mobilization, and recover lost territory to prolong the life of the country. If there are still unspeakable secrets, or restrictions that prevent you from doing anything, then the party has clearly gone bankrupt and should immediately return political power to the entire people, convene a national conference, and create a government for national salvation, so that the entire nation can fight together. Facing imminent disaster, there is no room for hesitation. How will you decide on a grand plan to atone to the world? Please immediately demonstrate with facts. Otherwise, the people, in their grief and indignation, will not be willing to sit and die, and may adopt extraordinary measures to seek self-salvation and national salvation. The urgent telegram awaits your decision. The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China [signed by]: Xiong Xiling, Ma Xiangbo, Zhang Binglin, Zhang Yilin, Zhu Qinglan, Zhao Fengchang, Wen Zongyao, Li Genyuan, Zhao Hengti, Cheng Zikai, Tao Jiayao, Peng Yunyi, Zhang Yaozeng, Xu Yuangao, Guo Chunsen, Shen Junru, Wang Yungong, Luo Jiaheng, Li Weilun, Zhu Qinglai, Jiang Qun, Zhang Kewei, Xu Kecheng, Chen Zemin, Jiang Hengyuan, Wu Shan, Qiu Fenling, Zhang Shizhao, Wang Shao, Zhou Huipu, Zhu Weiyue, Huang Wenzhong, Shen Tianxin, Zhu Duomin, Li Yukun, You Zhi, Zhao Shuyong, Wei Bozhen, Zhang, Xiao Jianbin, Wang Ningdu, Hu Zusun, Li Weicheng, Daonan, Zhang Zhaotong, Chen Dingyuan, Yang Chunruo, Zhang Xiaocen, Liu Yi, Wang Jiangao, Qiu Cong, Xiong Ren, Wang Jusun, Guo Zhijiang, Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Nanqiu, Li Zuohui, Song Yunhui, Xu Diaoxi, Zhu Shaowen, Fan Deguang, Zhao Zhengping, Huang Yanpei, Chu Fucheng, and others.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji and He Yingqin's Conversation After Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Crux of the Situation Lies in Guangdong</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Yearning for Unification</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, previously received orders to go to Ningbo to urge Chiang Kai-shek to come to Nanjing and jointly plan national affairs. The two gentlemen returned to Shanghai from Ningbo on the Ningxing vessel at 5:00 AM yesterday. That evening, the two gentlemen released responsible statements and distributed them to various newspapers. The details are recorded below. Question: "What was the result of your trip to Fenghua to urge Mr. Chiang to go to Nanjing?" Answer: "We left Shanghai on the evening of the 11th and arrived in Fenghua on the 12th. We immediately went up the mountain to meet Mr. Chiang and explained the current national crisis, the increasingly pressing diplomatic and financial situation, and the desire of all parties for Mr. Chiang to go to Nanjing to take on difficult tasks. Mr. Chiang's attitude was very sincere, and he was also very anxious about national affairs. He stated that although he has resigned from his duties, his desire for unification against foreign [aggression] remains the same. He will definitely support whatever he can do. He hopes that Mr. Zhesheng and his colleagues in Ningbo will be able to endure any hardship and rescue the country from its difficulties. He also hopes that all parties will consider the current difficulties, implement the resolutions of the peace conference, and support the National Government to maintain this bud of unification. Only then can the national unity against [aggression] that the whole country seeks be truly realized. My personal resignation this time was for the sake of promoting unification. As long as the country is truly unified and the entire party is truly united, and my personal presence in Nanjing is no longer considered an obstacle to unification, then at any time, if the party and the country have a mission, I will not hesitate to go through fire and water." Question: "What are Mr. Zhang's views on the current situation?" Answer: "Over the years, I have deeply felt the necessity of unity for the party and the country. After the Mukden Incident, I felt even more that all comrades responsible for political affairs have a responsibility to actively solve the national crisis. This trip to Guangdong and participation in the Shanghai conference were all aimed at this goal. I have never advocated that anyone resign during the national crisis. Therefore, the Shanghai conference did not have a resolution asking Mr. Chiang to resign. However, the comrades in Guangdong insisted on this point, believing that a unified government could only be formed after Mr. Chiang resigned. Mr. Chiang, in view of this, did not want to hinder unification because of his personal reasons, so he resolutely resigned and tried his best to achieve it. However, even though he is out of office, he still encourages us to support the unified government. His upright attitude is admirable. As for Mr. Wang, he is currently recuperating in the hospital. Although I followed the doctor's advice and was unable to meet with him, I also firmly believe that he has the same determination to overcome the national crisis. At present, to solve the difficult problems of diplomacy and finance, there is only one way: to maintain unification. The unified government in Nanjing was organized in response to the wishes of the comrades in Guangdong, and most of the personnel were from Guangdong. Therefore, no matter what, the comrades in Guangdong should first show their support to show their sincerity in seeking unification. As long as the two Guangs abolish their free special organizations, hand over tax revenues, and return to the state before independence, then all parties will not rise up to emulate them. Progressing along this path, unification will be true in name and reality, and finance will not fall into despair, and diplomacy will also have a reasonable solution. When Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang enter Nanjing at that time, there should be no problems. Therefore, I believe that the crux of the current situation, to put it bluntly, is not in Wang, nor in Chiang, but in Guangdong. I sincerely hope that the comrades in Guangdong will prioritize the overall situation of the party and the country, change their ways, and maintain unification. I especially hope that Mr. Hu Zhantang will bear the heavy responsibility of the party and the country and use his sincerity to move the comrades in the two Guangs to complete unification and unite to resist [aggression]. Otherwise, the overall situation of the country will be beyond repair. Therefore, Mr. Yu Youren's trip to Hong Kong is a crucial step in the current situation. I urge all comrades of the party and all compatriots of the country to recognize that the crux of the situation lies in Guangdong and should make every effort to promote the resolution of the Guangdong issue. The Nanjing government should also take full responsibility for resolving the semi-independent state of Guangdong, and must not create unnecessary complications and cause social panic. If necessary in the future, order me to go to Guangdong again, and I am willing to work for it." Question: "What are Mr. Jingzhi's feelings on the current situation?" (Mr. He replied) "At present, to solve the national crisis, the prerequisite is true unification. If unification is only in name, the country will be in even greater danger. Rumors of a nine-province joint defense, etc., as of now, I firmly believe that they are absolutely not true. I heard that Mr. Chiang had also telegraphed in a private capacity to inquire about whether it was true, saying that if the rumors were true, it would be no different from a transformation of the warlord era, which would be contrary to the country's desire. Currently, the state of withholding national taxes and division, if allowed to spread, will lead to the formation of a separatist situation. How can we resist foreign [aggression]? I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to this, promote the support of the central government by all parties, and complete true unification, so that national affairs can be solved."</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Joint Meeting of All Sectors</h3>
<p>Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Education Declared Meeting Adjourned</p>
<p>Various Groups Present at the Meeting Decided on Important Matters</p>
<p>Scheduled Citizens' Assembly for the 17th</p>
<p>In view of the fall of Jinzhou and the Japanese invaders' advance on Shanhaiguan, representatives of various sectors including agriculture, industry, commerce, and education in this city held a joint meeting at the city chamber of commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures against Japanese aggression and for national salvation. Because the number of attendees was less than that required, the meeting was adjourned. Instead, the groups that attended the meeting convened automatically and decided on several important matters. The following is a report on each item:</p>
<p>Participating Groups: The groups that participated in the meeting were Shanghai Dockworkers' Anti-Japanese Association, Northeast Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, Taiwan Youth Anti-Japanese Association, Faculty of Law, Modern Middle School, Yangshupu Elementary School, China Public School, Shanghai Eastern District Elementary School Students' Anti-Japanese Association, Unemployed Workers' Anti-Japanese Association, Jiangnan College, Binding Workers' Union, Youth National Salvation Alliance, Various Universities' Delegation to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Headquarters, Rickshaw Pullers' Union, Xihe Yarn Factory Workers' Union, Women's National Salvation Alliance, Wensheng English Specialty School, Dongya Sports School, Shen Qi Anti-Japanese Association, Tongxing Yarn Factory Workers' Anti-Japanese Association, Chinese Students Association of Japan, Shanghai Middle School People's Anti-Japanese United Association, Fujian Various Groups Delegation, Aurora University, Shanghai Fine Arts School, and over 200 other groups, with over 300 representatives.</p>
<p>Temporary Alert: Sun Mou, the captain of the 6th Company of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Police Brigade, in order to maintain order and prevent any incidents due to the large number of groups attending the meeting, placed 30 armed police officers stationed at the City Chamber of Commerce on guard. The Chamber of Commerce's security team was also fully mobilized to prevent incidents.</p>

However, over 300 representatives from various groups attended the meeting. After an explanation by the representative of the Anti-Japanese Joint Association of Students, it was deemed ineffective. The number of people originally scheduled to join the joint meeting had not reached the required number. Therefore, the Anti-Japanese Joint Association of Major and Secondary Schools announced, "Today's joint meeting is adjourned due to the lack of the required number of attendees."</p>
<p>Continuing the Meeting: After the Anti-Japanese Associations of Major and Secondary School Students announced the adjournment, they immediately withdrew. The various groups that attended the meeting insisted on continuing to hold a joint meeting of Anti-Japanese groups from all sectors. The meeting was then held in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. The People's Anti-Japanese United Association of Jiaotong University and the Xihe Yarn Factory Workers' Union were elected as the presidium, and the Chinese Students Association of Japan was elected as the recording secretary. At that time, for the sake of caution, the People's Anti-Japanese Association, the Students Association of Japan, and other groups were designated as inspectors to check the qualifications of each representative and to seat the press reporters. Anyone who was not a representative was rejected.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Yuan Yiqun, the chairman of the presidium of the assembly and the chairman of the Jiaotong University's People's Anti-Japanese United Association, stated in his report that today's joint meeting of Anti-Japanese groups from all sectors is convened because the brutal Japanese have forcibly occupied our three northeastern provinces and are continuing to attack our country. Now that Jinzhou has fallen and Shanhaiguan is in danger, the government has no solution and is relying entirely on the people to unite and deal with Japanese imperialism. Therefore, please express your opinions as much as possible and jointly discuss concrete measures to save our country from its current crisis and ensure the survival of the Chinese nation.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Huang and Deputy Minister Lin Have Not Been at Their Offices Since Yesterday</h3>
<p>Finance Deputy Minister Lin Kanghou Talks About the Reasons for Resigning</p>
<p>No Solution for Politics, No Solution for Finance</p>
<p>Finance Minister Huang Hanliang and Deputy Minister Lin Kanghou have not been at their office at the Shanghai office of the Finance Ministry since submitting their resignations. The reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency visited Deputy Minister Lin Kanghou at the Bankers Association yesterday afternoon and inquired about the reasons for the sudden resignation. He granted an interview and stated, "My resignation is because Minister Huang has already indicated his resignation, so I also resigned to express my joint advance and retreat. Also, at the Sun Residence meeting a few days ago, there was a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on public bonds, which is contrary to my original intention of serving as the Finance Deputy Minister. Therefore, even if I were to serve in the future, I would feel that I have no way to face the people. Moreover, the central government's expenses require 18 million yuan per month. Traditionally, one-third of the funds are paid in cash each month, and the remainder is borrowed from banks with public bonds as collateral. The public bond fund issued from customs is then allocated to the banks in the following month. Each month, it is supported by the credibility of public bonds. If the payment of principal and interest on public bonds is suspended, there will be no solution in the future. Moreover, since the organization of the Special Committee has no legal basis, disputes will inevitably increase. How can politics be put on the right track? If politics is not on the right track, there will be no solution for finance. Therefore, if you want finance to have a solution in the future, you must first have a solution for politics. If there is a solution for politics, not only finance, but everything else can have a solution."</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Rumor of Misappropriation of Bond Funds</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang and Zhang Qun Mediate</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, yesterday, a certain gentleman familiar with the financial circles said that the monthly expenditure of the Nanjing National Government must be 22 million, of which 18 million is for military expenses, 4 million for party and government expenses, and in addition, there is also the principal and interest repayment of public bonds and treasury bills, which has not yet been included at 14 million per month. On the revenue side, after the unfortunate incident of interception of national taxes occurred in various places, only the customs duties and consolidated taxes of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs amounted to 7 million yuan per month. As for the issuance of financial public bonds, due to the extremely tight money supply, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and the paper currency is particularly inflated, it is not easy to issue. Therefore, the financial revenue has sharply decreased, and there is no way to reduce expenditure. The special committee for dealing with the difficult situation decided to misappropriate 14 million yuan per month used for the principal and interest repayment fund of bonds for military and political expenses. Therefore, Finance Minister Huang Hanliang resigned, and it is said that Chen Mingshu is internally appointed to succeed him. After hearing the news, the local silver and money industries and the 25 treasury bill custody fund committee were extremely panicked and have already expressed their firm opposition. Zhang Jingjiang, a member of the Central Committee, was also worried that this policy was not very appropriate. The day before yesterday afternoon, he tried to persuade Zhang Yuejun to mediate, and Zhang agreed to do his best to mediate.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Continue to Strive to Deny Suspension of Public Bond Principal and Interest Payments</h3>
<p>Since all sectors of this city heard the news that the government was suspending the payment of principal and interest on public bonds, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bondholders Association, and the Silver and Money Industry Association unanimously expressed their opposition, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, various groups continued to strive for this, which is recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, and the Municipal Party Department telegraphed the Nanjing Central Executive Committee yesterday, (title omitted) Since the completion of the Northern Expedition of our Party and the establishment of the capital in Jinling, there have been many troubles in all directions, and government expenditures have been stretched. Public bonds and treasury bills have been issued repeatedly to provide financial support. The amount of the levy is no less than 700 to 800 million. This is not because the financial resources of the people are sufficient and there is surplus capital to bear this, but because the public sentiment hopes for governance and hopes that our Party will be able to respect and stabilize the country and save the people from water and fire. Therefore, they do not hesitate to exhaust their meagre strength and strive to subscribe. This kind of experience is really a manifestation of the people's sincere support for our Party. Recalling the years of the Republic of China, from three to four years, Yuan Shikai issued only 24 million public bonds, and even apportioned them to each county, exhausting their efforts, only to barely reach the full amount. After our Party came to power, it continued to issue public bonds up to 700 to 800 million. If combined with those issued by the Northern Government, the total amount is almost more than 100 million. From this point alone, it can be proved that our country's public bonds have been popularized among the general public across the country, and the situation is definitely not comparable to that of the Republic of China in the years three to four. Therefore, the people regard public bonds not only as a kind of circulating securities on the market, but also as the same as farmland and real estate. Once the credit of the bonds is shaken, the people who rely on this movable property for their livelihood will inevitably lose their source of food and clothing. At this time, the bandits and communists are everywhere, and after the great famine of last year, most of the people have no land to cultivate and no business to operate. If the principal and interest of these hundreds of millions of bonds are suspended, then tens of millions more people who have no way to support themselves will inevitably be added, endangering the foundation of the country, which is unbearable to imagine. And the commercial market will lose this large number of securities for turnover and circulation, and it will inevitably collapse, and the phenomenon of unemployment of the four peoples will be compensated. Moreover, it is feared that the majority of the people will also suspect our Party, thinking that this kind of policy is going the same way as the Soviet Union's denial of all debts, but with different approaches. And the actual panic caused at that time may be no less than the phenomenon after the Soviet-Russian European War. At that time, although the Soviet Union's production declined and the ruble was equal to waste paper, there was no basis for foreign economic aggression in the country, so it could rely on its power to implement an economic system that it had obtained, and in a few years, its national strength was restored. If in our country, there is only one decline. Therefore, the suspension of the principal and interest of all public bonds may be a relief measure in other countries, but in our country, it is directly a way of suicide. The situation is different and cannot be compared. If the unified government really wants to shoulder the responsibility of internal stability and external resistance, it should inherit the doctrine of our Party, respect the public opinion of the people, and do its best to eliminate all obstacles to unification, so that finances can be stabilized and people's livelihood can be restored, and then it can be said to resist foreign insults. It is impossible to create extraneous branches, abandon food because of choking, and use the local government's interception of tax money as an excuse to come up with this inferior policy of misappropriating public bond funds and suspending principal and interest payments. If there is such a proposal, it is earnestly requested that your committee make every effort to stop it and prevent it from being realized, so as to appease the people's hearts and stabilize the foundation of the country. The association is appealing for the people, and is overwhelmed by the urgent waiting for orders. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City Executive Committee bowed, winter seal,</p>

<h3>Bondholders Association</h3>
<p>To the Letter of the Silver and Money Industry Association, the Domestic Public Bond Bondholders Association sent a letter to the Silver and Money Industry Association yesterday, saying: Greetings, I recently read your esteemed association's letter to the government authorities on January 14, which clearly opposed the government's proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on bonds, and thoroughly stated the advantages and disadvantages without any remainder. The attitude is firm and sufficient to awaken the mediocre and cowardly. And at the end of the telegram, "Otherwise, in order to maintain the national credit, in order to maintain social security, in order to maintain the lives of ordinary people, and in order to maintain educational institutions, our association will do its best to gather all public organizations in the country, not hesitating to sacrifice everything and take various measures to be the backing of the custody fund committee, in order to defend ourselves and preserve our lifeline," it shows a clear purpose and concern for the overall situation. In the future, all political and financial matters will be based on the firm opinions of your association, and all public organizations will follow suit, and the country will surely be placed on a solid foundation, and the people will be freed from water and fire. Our association takes a consistent attitude to be the backing of the bond fund custody committee. Corresponding letter, I hope you will check and deal with it. Sincerely, Shanghai Banking Association, Money Industry Association,</p>
<p>To the Letter of the Custody Fund Association, the association also sent a letter to the Fund Custody Committee, saying: Greetings, I recently read the declaration of your esteemed association and the telegram to the National Government in the Shanghai newspapers of January 14. They uphold the national trust and care for the people's livelihood, and the words are righteous and the words are loyal and pertinent. I secretly think that the Kuomintang, which claims to be responsible for saving the country and saving the people, and the government under its guidance, should be able to follow good advice and cancel this reckless act of harming the country and harming the people and committing suicide and killing the people. In case the government abandons the national trust and despises the people's livelihood, please, gentlemen, hold the determination of Chairman Wang Xiaolai that the head can be broken and the use of the public bond fund must not be moved. Any violence will have no way to use its skills. The members of our association swear to be the backing and are willing to live and die together. Corresponding letter, I hope you will check and deal with it. Sincerely, Jianghai Customs 25% Surtax Treasury Bond Custody Fund Committee,</p>
<p>To the Letter of Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Greetings, The Party Government, which is responsible for saving the country and saving the people, has been in internal strife for years, and the debt has been piled high. The people have been displaced, and the territory has been reduced by thousands of miles every day. Recently, it has even异想天开、随石瑛提议展缓拨付公债库劵本息之后、拟重提旧事、立即实行停付本息。如果成为事实、执票人固首当其冲、而一般社会经济、亦必根本推毁、国信既失、政何以立、现在人民同具爱国之心、均有己立立国之责、顷读先生一月十四日（对各报谈话有「头可断基金之用途绝对不能移动」</p>

<p>Zhejiang Bondholders Association sent a letter, The association received a letter from the Zhejiang Domestic Public Bond Bondholders Association yesterday, saying: Greetings, I recently read in the newspaper that your esteemed association has issued a telegram to stop the interception of national taxes in various provinces, which affects the bond fund. The wording is strict and righteous, and I admire it very much. However, today's warlords are tyrannical, and it seems that the current government's power cannot stop it. Moreover, the military pay is not available, and the provinces are also full of reasons. I think that the economic conference has previously stipulated a monthly military expenditure of 18 million, and the provinces should send more and more. The government should be asked to telegraph each province to allocate the central government's stipulated assistance amount in full, and the national tax should not be intercepted, so as to avoid disrupting the financial system, so that things can be fair, and the interception can be expected to be cancelled. This is one thing. In addition, each bond has a designated fund. If the customs duty, if the cigarette consolidated tax, if the salt tax, the principal and interest of each bond due should be used as cash and allowed to pay various taxes. This is also a very correct method. The central government should be asked to issue a clear order, so that the people can pay taxes with this without violating the law, and the provincial governments will not have any words to refuse. At this moment, the provinces are holding national taxes, hoping to get cash. As a result, they still get paper scraps. They should also return in disappointment. Considering that the provinces will implement power and refuse to accept it, then what is the solution to the central government's laws and regulations, and it is even more felt that the people are terrible, and it seems that it can also have some effect. This is the second thing. Moreover, the national bonds should be fully repaid with principal and interest, and there is no discount to speak of. However, in terms of financial practice, there must be a market price. However, if the price is lowered so much, where is the national credit? In the past, the Ministry of Finance had to follow the trend in order to promote the sale of bonds, hoping to get cash. Now, the holders of the old government's bonds are all the people, and the stock exchange can temporarily suspend the market in accordance with the laws and regulations, so as to avoid the daily decline in bond prices and the floating of people's hearts. Bank accounts and private pledges are all of great importance, and the Ministry of Finance can also be urgently requested to implement it. This is the third thing. The above three points are only the humble opinions that I have reached, and I would like to contribute a little bit. I hope that your esteemed association will publicly discuss and adopt them for implementation, so that we can work together to overcome this difficulty. Sincerely, China Domestic Public Bond Treasury Bond Bondholders Association, Zhejiang Domestic Public Bond Treasury Bond Bondholders Association, January 12,</p>
<h3>Bondholders Association</h3>
<p>The National National Debt Bondholders Association sent a letter to the Fund Custody Committee yesterday, saying: Greetings, Since hearing the government's proposal to misappropriate public bond treasury bond funds, the wind has spread, and the public is panicked. I read the document of your esteemed association to the National Government today, and I see that the words are long and the heart is heavy, and the points are to the point. However, this association cannot but talk about the people around it, because the public bond treasury bonds are related to the people's livelihood. Once the bond fund can be misappropriated, the repayment of principal and interest will inevitably be unable to cope, and the suspension of principal and interest will make all kinds of bonds waste paper, and economic panic can be staged sooner or later. The government does not start with rectifying the discipline and strictly eliminating the floating expenses, but takes the illegal seizure of the people's livelihood as its ability, which is very sad. However, I think that your esteemed association is responsible for the custody of the 25% treasury bond fund. At this time when the government is falsely advocating misappropriation, the responsibility is particularly important. However, your esteemed association is produced by the entrustment of the people of the whole country and acts in accordance with the statutory bond regulations. It is not subject to the restraint of any group or the constraints of any order. The meaning is clear and does not need to be explained. If the bond fund is illegally used, even if it is a fraction of a cent, it is difficult to escape the crime of abuse of power. With the wisdom of the gentlemen of your esteemed association, you have already seen this. I hope that you will do your best to maintain the bond credit. The members of our association swear to be the backing. This letter is sent to you for your review and processing. National National Debt Bondholders Association,</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Association</h3>
<p>To the Chairman of each province, The title is omitted. I heard that the government has a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on domestic public bonds. For a time, the public was panicked and the market was shocked. Our two associations sent a public telegram to the central government on the (13th) of this month to state the advantages and disadvantages, saying (recorded the telegram to the National Government): Check that this matter is related to the national credit and the people's livelihood, and it is very important and huge. If it is implemented once, it will inevitably make the country fall into a place of no return. Without waiting for the strong neighbor to enter the country, it has already fallen into ruin. This is indeed a matter of life and death. We specially telegraphed to ask your seat to advocate justice and ask the central government to cancel this proposal in order to save the national fortune and maintain the people's livelihood. I can't help but hope. Shanghai Banking Association and Money Industry Association, cold, To the local industry telegram (above omitted) I heard that the government has a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on domestic public bond treasury bonds. For a time, the public was panicked and the market was shocked. Our two associations sent a telegram to the central government on the (13th) of this month to state the advantages and disadvantages, saying (recorded the telegram to the National Government): Check that this matter is related to the national credit and the people's livelihood, and it is very important and huge. If it is implemented once, it will inevitably bankrupt the whole country. Without waiting for the strong neighbor to enter the country, it has already fallen into ruin. How can we remain silent? We specially telegraphed to ask your association to directly telegraph the central government and unanimously advocate that it must not be realized. It is the prayer of Shanghai Banking Association and Money Industry Association, cold,</p>
<p>Pingyin Association Telegram, Shanghai Banking Association Jian, I recently received a telegram from Shanghai that the government's financial plan involves securities funds. Various groups in Shanghai have agreed on five measures in order to save it. The number of securities is hundreds of millions, and the bondholders are from all over the world. They have long been popularized. Once the fund is shaken, the national credit and the people's livelihood are difficult to imagine. Our association should follow your esteemed association to advocate unanimously. If there are any measures, please telegraph them at any time so that we can follow them. Beijing Banking Association,</p>
<p>Tianjin Yin Association Telegram, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Banking Association and Money Industry Association Jian, I recently heard that your esteemed association is planning a group of solid measures for the domestic debt fund to avoid shaking. This move is a necessary plan for stabilizing the social economy and maintaining the lifeline of the people. Our association deeply expresses its approval. I hope that you will express your opinions on the government and society at any time so that we can all tend to be consistent and support each other. Tianjin Banking Association,</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>To the letter of the Fund Custody Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the 25 Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee yesterday, saying: Greetings, Since the government has a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on public bonds, the public is shocked. Our association and the silver and money industry groups have telegraphed to the courts to argue for it. Your esteemed association also has a declaration, saying "The duty of this association is to do its best to take stable measures when necessary, and always expect the regulations of the National Government to continue to be effective," etc., which shows the utmost sincerity in taking care of the national entrustment and maintaining the financial monarch. Our association believes that the current urgent measures should be continued to maintain the fifth and eighth articles of the custody regulations by your esteemed association, so that no party can destroy them. The analysis is as follows: (1) Before the entrusted various bonds and treasury bonds to be kept by your esteemed association have not been cleared, if anyone rashly changes the custody authority, they should resolutely refuse. (2) The collecting agency should transfer the full amount it collects to the Fund Committee layer by layer every day, and your esteemed association should do its best to prevent changes. Within the necessary scope, our association should also represent the merchants and people of the city to give real support. I hope you will check and deal with it, and reply. To the Jianghai Customs 25% Surtax Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee,</p>
<p>Reply to the Yichang County Chamber of Commerce Telegram, The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Yichang County Chamber of Commerce's telegram of the 8th yesterday, saying, Yichang County Chamber of Commerce Jian, All the telegrams have been received. The matter of suspension of payment of principal and interest on public bond treasury bonds has not been discussed by the entire association, but in recent days, the government has decided to implement it due to the shortage of government funds, and the public is shocked. Our association has already telegraphed to argue for it yesterday. I still hope that your esteemed association will continue to telegraph the government and courts to express your pain and strive for it, hoping to unite the group and protect the bond credit. This is the Shanghaishi Chamber of Commerce, cold seal,</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: I recently heard that the central government has a proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on domestic public bond treasury bonds. The news has spread and the whole country is shocked. Check that the national public bond treasury bonds issued by our National Government over the years are of great amount. Our national system and national finances are difficult, and the wood servants have a sense of responsibility. They do not hesitate to contribute their sweat and blood, and actively transport and purchase. The original purchase was that the bond fund was indeed reliable, the credit was stable, and the repayment of principal and interest was carried out on schedule. Some of them were used as various funds, and some of them were used for daily life. Its circulation in the market is no different from the banknotes issued by the government. If the principal and interest are suspended once, the impact will be unimaginable. This policy is no different from suicide. It is reasonable to telegraph and return to your government and ministry to check and verify and earnestly request to cancel this proposal and maintain national credit. I pray very much. National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Koyi,</p>
<h3>Foreign Dollar within Two Days</h3>
<p>Since the news of the suspension of allocation of bond principal and interest payments came out, the hearts of the people in the city have been panicked. The previous day, the money industry association's market opened at 74 cents, and people still looked high. They held on until 11:00, and the price could not be settled. The market saw this situation and believed that this matter was of great importance. If measures were not taken urgently, the people's hearts would become more and more floating. Therefore, the money industry association asked the Central China and Communication Banks for instructions separately. As a result, Hu Mengjia, the general manager of Jiaotong Bank, first sold 720,000 standard oceans from Jiaotong Bank. Later, the Bank of China also continued to sell 1 million yuan of cash. After these two banks released 1.72 million yuan, the ocean market began to calm down, and the market price gradually recovered to 71 cents, 9 li and a half. Hu Mengjia, the general manager of Jiaotong Bank, also invited the leaders of the money industry the night before to discuss ways to maintain the market. It is said that the result of the consultation was that the silver and money industries decided to maintain the market and do their best to stabilize the people's hearts. Therefore, yesterday, the ocean market in the money industry market was gradually settled due to the maintenance of the China and Communication Banks the day before, and the circulation of cash was much more. The China and Communication Banks were also worried that the cash was too surging and the price of the ocean was too low, and they even had receipts to level the market.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Form Bondholders Association</h3>
<p>According to news from the consulate, the number of various stable public bond treasury bonds held by foreign merchants in our country is about 80 million. Now that the bondholders have heard that our authorities have implemented the suspension of public bond principal and interest payments, the bondholders have risen up to contact the consulates of their respective countries. At the same time, the consul negotiated with the General Taxation Department of the Customs, and the guarantee fund for public bond treasury bonds must comply with the public agreement conditions and must not be misappropriated for other purposes. On the one hand, the foreign bondholders have prepared everything and will establish a bondholders association immediately to take concerted action.</p>
<h3>Financial Circles Discuss Financial Issues</h3>
<p>The rumor about the suspension of public bond principal and interest payments has caused significant economic unrest in society. A reporter specifically interviewed a certain important person who is related to finance. According to him, after the proposal to suspend public bond principal and interest payments was raised, capitalists ran around to inform each other, as if a catastrophe was imminent. On the 13th, the silver and money industries held meetings one after another, and there was no result until the afternoon. Until the 13th, Zhang Jingjiang mediated, and on the one hand, the government declared to maintain the credit of public bonds. On the other hand, the silver and money industries first handled an advance payment of 5 million to cope with the government's current difficulties. When Song Ziwen handed over, there were still more than 800,000 customs payments. Up to now, after half a month, the tax revenue has also accumulated 2 million. The banking industry is willing to make this payment public to the government. On the one hand, they asked the new government to notify Guangzhou and also transfer 6 million to the central government. This intention has been telegraphed to Sun Ke Chen Mingshu.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Telegram Asks to Delay the Establishment of a Special Committee</h3>
<p>No Legal Basis and No Justice</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Telegram Detailed Three Major Reasons</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Municipal Party Department telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, saying: Nanjing Central Executive Committee Jian, The newspaper reported that because the three members of Wang Jianghu cannot enter Beijing immediately, it is proposed to set up a special committee in the Central Political Conference and appoint nine people to preside over it. It will be submitted to your meeting for resolution. It is deeply panicked. At this time of national crisis, the Central Political Conference should be convened quickly in order to preside over all the major plans of the party and the country. It is imperative. However, since there is an organization of the Central Political Conference, there is no need to set up a special committee again. It is not only legally unfounded, but also creates extraneous branches and puts a bed on top of a bed, and there is no need for it in justice. Will it be said that the three standing members cannot attend Beijing? On December 29, the Central Political Conference held the 300th meeting. Due to the fact that Chairman Yu Youren chaired the meeting, many important cases were discussed and the candidates for the ministers of the National Government were determined. At that time, the three standing members had never been in Beijing. It is known that the meeting of the Central Political Conference does not necessarily require the attendance of the three standing members before it can be held. Moreover, the standing members of the political conference are only the chairmen of the meeting, and they are completely different from the standing committee as an independent organization. Even without a standing member as the chairman, each member can also elect a chairman themselves. There are precedents, and it is not difficult to review them. This is one reason why a special committee should not be set up. The three members of Wang Jianghu are the leaders of the party and the country. We sincerely hope that they can enter the capital hand in hand and go to the national crisis together. However, since they cannot go to Beijing at the same time in fact, weighing the urgency, Member Wang is near at hand and should be ordered to enter the capital first. If one standing member attends the meeting, it can be convened. There is no need for the three standing members to attend at the same time before a meeting can be held. Today's problem is not in the system itself, but in whether each person can be responsible. If they are not responsible, then there are many branches and leaves, and although there are many organizations, it will not help. This is the second reason why a special committee should not be set up. In the past, during the First Plenary Session, three organizational principles were resolved for the political conference. The first article stated that "the Central Political Conference is organized by members of the Central Executive Committee and members of the Central Supervisory Committee." It can be seen that the original intention of the plenary session was to concentrate talents and be jointly responsible, so as to avoid a few people from monopolizing power and being solely responsible. Therefore, the second article stated that "three standing members are set up, and they take turns to be the chairman when the meeting is held," and the organization of the standing committee is not adopted. The previous and subsequent meanings can be explained to each other. Now, a special committee is suddenly organized by a very small number of nine people to exercise the functions of the political conference, which is obviously contrary to the previously set principles. Moreover, the principles set by the plenary meeting cannot be changed by a small number of members. This is the third reason why a special committee should not be set up. At that time, foreign troubles were imminent and the national crisis was deepening. It was still too late to unite against the insult. Member Jiang has already left to promote unity, and Member Hu should come to the national crisis together. If it is to people, then people have already left. If it is to things, then things are already urgent. Therefore, today, we can only urge the three members to go to Beijing to take office and open the political conference as soon as possible to preside over all the major plans for saving the country. Taking care of people and things, there is nothing better than this. The establishment of the special committee is neither legally founded nor justified. This kind of deformed organization should be temporarily delayed to avoid complications. Is it appropriate? Please decide. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee Knocked, cold,</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Telegram Asks the Government to Eliminate Internal Strife and Resist Foreign Insults</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association telegraphed the government, saying: Nanjing National Government Jian, Since the fall of Jinzhou, the Japanese army has been pressing internally, and the whole country is shocked. However, the government has not heard of any plan to consolidate the northern defense. General Ma Zhanshan is holding on to the outside of the fortress with a lone army, and Brigade Commander He Zhuguo has vowed to protect Yuguan. If there are no reinforcements, it is deeply worried that they will perish together. The government is entrusted with the heavy trust of the people. As long as it is in office, it has a responsibility to fulfill every day. It cannot be leisurely and sit idle. Recently, the volunteers have fought and resisted to the death, which is even more sad to read, which shows that the national morale and national strength are not unusable. It all depends on how the government's foreign policy decides. In the past two weeks, the division of political power in the country has become increasingly bad. Warlords have taken the army as their private property, and even intercepted customs and salt taxes, so as to seal themselves off. Separation and disintegration cannot end the day. However, the power of transfer lies with the government. If the government can painfully reflect on itself, eliminate the struggle for melons and beans, clearly set the method, and take the unanimous resistance to foreign insults as the goal, declare domestic public opinion, and at the same time urge, the national situation will inevitably change immediately. Otherwise, the overall situation will collapse, which is currently the case. There is something that this association cannot bear to say, so I specially telegraphed this to the Shanghai Lawyers Association.</p>
<h3>Youth Suicide Squad Departs Last Night</h3>
<p>Headed to Beijing First, Then to the Northeast</p>
<p>More than fifty members of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Suicide Squad for National Salvation departed last night at 11:45 pm on a fast train to Beijing, en route to the Northeast. Many people from various public organizations saw them off. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Structure: The squad consists of more than fifty members, with Ye Bin as the Executive Chairman. It is divided into five departments: General Affairs, Finance, Organization, Propaganda, and Training, as well as two committees: Economic and Disciplinary. Zhao Yaojin has been appointed as a rear area advisor to handle rear area affairs.</p>
<p>Organizations Sending Off: Yesterday, the organizations that came to the station to see them off included the entire volunteer army of the China Women's Physical Education School, the volunteer army of Tiehua Elementary School, the volunteer army of the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association, the Lizhi Society, the volunteer army of Anhui Middle School, and over ten groups, including the Suicide Squad for Anti-Japanese National Salvation on the Northeast Front composed of retired comrades from Japanese-owned yarn factories.</p>
<p>Gifts from Various Circles: The items presented to the squad by various circles included two "luo" (a unit) of bread and a "Return Our Rivers and Mountains" cloth banner from the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association and the Lizhi Society. The China National Salvation Travel Group donated 200 National Salvation Certificates. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Suicide Squad of Japanese-owned yarn factories donated a "National Pioneer" cloth banner. Other donations collected at the time amounted to over one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Family Members' Persuasion: All members of the squad hold the purpose of sacrificing their lives to save the country, so no one withdrew at the last minute. Yesterday, Hua Xiang, a soldier from the Second Company of the First Battalion of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army Independent Regiment, was persuaded by his brother-in-law, who had come from Wuxi, and exhorted with righteousness. However, Hua Xiang believed that sacrificing his life to save the country was paramount, and other matters could not be considered. He remained unmoved.</p>
<p>Departure Details: All squad members gathered at the North Station at around 1 pm. After roll call, they rested at the station and sent representatives to negotiate with the station about train tickets, but to no avail. Finally, they boarded the train and departed at 11:45 pm.</p>
<p>Travel Route: Ye Bin, Executive Chairman of the squad, said that after arriving in Beijing, the squad will first visit the Mausoleum on Purple Mountain. After crossing the Yangtze River, they will take a train to Xuzhou, then transfer to the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou, and then take the Pinghan Railway to Beiping. They will then detour out of the Pass to join volunteer armies from various places outside the Pass to face the national crisis together.</p>
<p>Suicide Declaration: Since the September 18th National Humiliation Incident, the brutal Japanese have taken advantage of our country's disasters and, with their boundless desires, invaded our territory, massacred our compatriots, and implemented their Koreanization strategy to carry out their Manchurian-Mongolian policy. Our compatriots cried out for help but were helpless and waited for death. Our government respects peace and supports the League of Nations. However, the so-called League of Nations is merely a transitional organization of 20th-century human civilization and has no real power to judge right and wrong. Therefore, for several months, the League of Nations has been the League of Nations, and the brutal Japanese have been the brutal Japanese, and they still carry out their gangster tactics, invading and plundering, doing everything possible. Having occupied Liaoning and Heilongjiang, they now covet Pingjin. Countless of our compatriots have died tragically, and the country has not yet perished, but the butcher's knife has already been placed upon it. It is a laughingstock to friendly nations. How can this be tolerated? Although a single horse can be easily overthrown and a lone tree is hard to support, we feel the pain of the people and deeply believe that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, we have gathered comrades in Shanghai to organize the Youth Volunteer Suicide Squad for Anti-Japanese National Salvation to follow in the footsteps of patriotic martyrs, vowing to use our blood and heads to resist Japan and save the country. We swear not to return alive until the Japanese invaders retreat. We are purely motivated by patriotism and have no party affiliation. As long as it is Chinese territory and the nation is being defended, no matter where the disaster occurs or who is attacked, we are determined to have no boundaries and are willing to be pioneers, preferring to be war ghosts rather than slaves of a fallen nation. The rise and fall of the nation depends on this action. All our youth, come enthusiastically!</p>
<h3>Jinling University Students' Petition Delegation Goes to Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>Opinions of the Municipal Education Circle's National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Intensify the boycott of Japanese goods and strictly maintain order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Circle's National Salvation United Association respectfully informs the people of the whole country, saying: All compatriots across the country, the brutal Japanese have invaded, and the whole country is filled with grief and anger, determined to avenge our humiliation. Everyone is of one mind. However, how to rectify the army to eliminate the wolves and tigers, and how to use diplomacy to negotiate, is the responsibility of the government. As for our people, we should do what we can to seek peace of mind. As for the boycott of Japanese goods, no matter what, we must work together to persist until the end. The methods of boycott are simple and easy to implement: one is not to buy, and the other is not to use. However, it is human nature to start diligently but end lazily, and it is inevitable for the mind to be easily agitated when things are too quiet. Now that the Japanese have occupied our Eastern Provinces for three months, and Jinzhou has fallen, and discussions have reached the Yuguan Pass, it is doubtful whether the boycott of Japanese goods in various places can become more and more intensive. Under this situation of declining public morale, it is even more difficult to ensure that patriotic people will not be temporarily motivated by righteousness and act impulsively, regardless of everything, which will lead to social disorder. The way to save the country lies in persevering and continuing to struggle, not in reckless and impulsive riots without any plan. If the people, who have no weapons, can truly carry out the boycott of Japanese goods, from themselves to their families, relatives, and neighbors, everyone is like this, everywhere is like this, then the effect of restraining the enemy will not be small. We sincerely hope that our dear compatriots across the country will make up their minds, intensify their work, use their spare time to widely persuade, thoroughly investigate, and diligently discuss, and take diligence and thrift as the essence of self-cultivation, and encourage each other. Our dear students who are in school are approaching the holidays and will return to their hometowns. We hope that they can make special efforts and not waste this great time, then the future of the nation will be hopeful. We hereby respectfully inform you, hoping that you will take note of this. Shanghai Municipal Education Circle's National Salvation United Association.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy for Wealth Results in Whole Family Suffering on Dung Boat</h3>
<p>Information on Stolen Funds is Discovered</p>
<p>Leading to the Tragedy of Being Drowned</p>
<p>Lin Changgui, a dung boat owner in the Huangpu River in this city, was targeted for his wealth, resulting in his entire family being sunk into the river, drowning six people, including men, women, and children. The results of the investigation are detailed below.</p>
<p>Family Lives on Dung Boat: Lin Changgui, from Dongtai, was 42 years old. His wife, Lin Wang, was 36 years old and pregnant. Their eldest daughter, Tong Nu, was 15 years old. Their second son, Lin Bao, was 9 years old. Their youngest son, Lin Gen, was 7 years old. They also hired a boat partner, Gu Zhengyun, who was 28 years old. They owned a large dung boat with a Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau license number of 20912, which was docked at the Guangxing Road pier in Shanghai, serving as their home.</p>
<p>Going to Fengjing to Collect Debts: Lin Changgui specialized in transporting fertilizer to Songjiang Fengjing and other places, traveling back and forth between Songjiang and Shanghai, making quite a profit. His younger brother, Lin Changyun, lived with him. There were debts of over 2,000 yuan owed to them in Fengjing. At the beginning of this year, Lin Changgui first sent his younger brother, Lin Changyun, to Fengjing to collect the debts, but he failed to collect them. Therefore, Lin Changgui loaded a boat of dung in Shanghai and went to Fengjing himself, with his whole family accompanying him on the boat. After unloading the dung, he went to various places to collect debts, and had collected about half of them.</p>
<p>Brother Said to Return First, Younger Brother Delayed: After Lin Changgui collected the debts, he could not abandon his business in Shanghai, so he sailed back on the morning of the 11th of this month. His younger brother, Lin Changyun, had other private matters, so he followed his brother later, returning to Shanghai by bus on the 12th.</p>
<p>Boat Unharmed, People Missing: After Lin Changyun arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he went to the Guangxing Road pier, but did not see his brother's boat. He calculated that Fengjing to Shanghai was a smooth journey, and his brother should have arrived in Shanghai on the 11th. Why had he not arrived after two days? He felt anxious and uneasy, so he went north along the Huangpu River to search. He found an empty boat near Jungong Road and Dinghai Road, which was his brother's boat. However, there was no one on board and no belongings.</p>
<p>Concluded to be a Tragedy of Being Drowned: Lin Changyun knew that something had happened, so he reported it to the water police station. The station sent Detective Bellis and Chinese Detective Sun Agui to investigate. The result was that robbers had tracked them to this remote location and robbed them. They must have been acquaintances, so they tied them up and threw them into the river. This was a tragedy of being drowned.</p>
<p>Two Bodies Found in Gaoqiao: The detectives immediately reported back to the police station, which notified the Life Saving Bureau to pay attention to dredging. Yesterday, the Life Saving Bureau recovered a female body and a child's body in Gaoqiao. They were immediately taken to the South Bund pier and notified the water police station. Chinese Detective Sun Agui took Lin Changyun to identify them. One was his sister-in-law, Lin Wang, and the other was his niece, Lin Sai. However, a gold locket on Lin Bao's neck had been cut off. The police station has decided to report to the local court for an autopsy today, and to continue dredging for the remaining bodies and thoroughly investigate the case.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Assassins of Zhao Announced</h3>
<p>Original Verdict Revoked, Sentence Changed to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xia Shaoen and Wang Jinshan, the two assassins who assassinated Zhao Tieqiao, the former director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, were sentenced to death by the Shanghai court. Xia and Wang declared in court that they were not satisfied and hired lawyers to appeal to the Suzhou High Court. It is now known that the Suzhou court held three hearings and carefully reviewed the reasons for the Shanghai court's death sentence, considering them insufficient. Therefore, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, Hu Shan, announced in court the day before yesterday that the original verdict was revoked and the two defendants, Xia and Wang, were sentenced to life imprisonment. This official document was delivered to the Shanghai Special District Court at 3 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Relief News</h3>

<h3>Baofeng Steamboat Robbed on the Wusong Sea Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Baofeng steamboat, which sailed from Chongming to Shanghai yesterday, carrying more than 400 passengers, was robbed by more than 30 pirates at around 10 am as it passed the sea off Wusongkou. The pirates rampaged on board for about an hour before leaving, satisfied with their loot. Many passengers were shot and injured, one of whom, a passenger surnamed Liu, died of his injuries. The steamboat arrived at Wusongkou at 3:30 pm. Because someone had died on board, the Western captain reported it to the harbor quarantine office, which sent personnel to inspect. It was also discovered that one person was infected with smallpox. The medical officer immediately ordered that the steamboat not be allowed to dock and that all passengers and crew must be vaccinated and given preventive injections before being allowed to disembark. In addition to reporting the incident to the authorities for investigation, the passengers on the steamboat, whose spirits had just recovered, were allowed to go home at around 6 pm. The losses of all passengers on board are still being investigated.</p>

<h3>Three More Kidnappers Apprehended in the Wu Nanpu Case</h3>
<p>Wu Zeyun, also known as Nanpu, a broker at the Huashang Cloth Exchange No. 49 from Jiangxi Province, was kidnapped on the 7th of this month and a ransom of 400,000 yuan was demanded. Lu Liankui, the chief inspector of the general inspectorate of the general police station, rescued Wu from the kidnappers' den in a bungalow at the Fangjia Wood Bridge in Beixinjing, and arrested eight kidnappers, including Lu Wen. The report has been published in this newspaper that they were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, another accomplice, Zhang Wenlong, was apprehended in Room 24 of the Suzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court the day before yesterday for interrogation by Judge Xu Jiashi. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated that Zhang had previously served as a detective in the Chinese area and had now resigned. Zhang confessed that he had been called by the already apprehended suspect Sun Jinpeng to negotiate the ransom and also confessed that he was involved in the kidnapping of Deng Zhonghe, the owner of the Daqing Cloth Store, and had received 160 yuan. However, as this case was being handled by Judge Zhou, he requested a postponement to combine the cases for interrogation. Judge Xu questioned Zhang briefly and ordered a postponement for a combined interrogation. In addition, Chinese Detective Shang Wu of the Huizi Police Station apprehended three more accomplices from Tongzhou, Lu A Hai, Li Wenbin, and Lu Caiwu, at the Meibaike Road and Wuzhen Road Bridge the day before yesterday and sent them to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested a postponement for a combined interrogation. When Li Wenbin was questioned, he confessed that he was responsible for taking photos in this case (i.e., identifying the plaintiff's common name), and Lu Caiwu confessed that he had rented a house for the bandits to hide the ticket. Judge Zhou verified the confessions and ordered the detention of the three defendants, Lu, and postponed the hearing for a combined interrogation.</p>
<h3>Case of Injury to Wang Youling</h3>
<p>Zhang Debiao Sentenced to 15 Days of Detention</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Youling, also known as Zijian, practiced law in Shanghai and set up his office at No. 100 Beijing Road. At 5:20 pm on the 5th of this month, Wang was leaving his office and was about to board his car when suddenly a man from Anhui named Zhang Debiao threw a can full of fecal matter at Wang's face, causing Wang's face to be covered in yellow and white matter, which smelled terrible. Zhang, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled the scene. Wang's driver chased and apprehended him, and turned him over to the police station. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Wang Youling presented a doctor's injury certificate, so the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted him for the crime of injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law. Zhang Debiao claimed that he had repeatedly failed to recover a debt from a certain Han, so he harbored resentment and threw feces at him, but accidentally hit lawyer Wang, which was unintentional, and asked for leniency. The judge verified the confession and ordered Zhang to provide a guarantor to be available at any time, and the case was postponed for further hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Shumu held a further hearing. Zhang Debiao's confession was the same as before. The police station's lawyer Qian requested a heavy sentence. Zhang's lawyer argued that the injury certificate presented by lawyer Wang only stated that his eyes were slightly red and awaited further changes. However, lawyer Wang's face was originally red, so it was difficult to prove whether his eyes were slightly red because of this incident. Moreover, lawyer Wang did not appear in court today and requested that he be declared not guilty. Judge Shen verified the confession and announced the verdict in court, sentencing Zhang Debiao to 15 days of detention as a warning.</p>
<h3>Compensation Increased at Slaughterhouse</h3>

<h3>Yuanlaihang Potato Flour Case</h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to be Eastern Flour, Should Bear All Responsibilities</p>
<p>Fined 40,000 Yuan to be Used for Flood Relief</p>
<p>The Yuanlaihang potato flour case was detained by the former Anti-Japanese and Aid Overseas Chinese Association on August 15 of last year and decided to confiscate it. On October 24, the firm submitted evidence of purchasing from the Netherlands and requested a review. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association then decided to fine 40,000 yuan for flood relief and returned the original goods to the firm. Yesterday, the association specially sent a letter to Yuanlaihang and the fundraising associations of various provinces to investigate and handle the case. The original letter is as follows: Respected Sir, regarding the Yuanlaihang potato flour case, it was previously decided at the ninth executive committee meeting of this association to allocate all the goods to urgent disaster relief donations, and the warehouse receipt was sent to your association for verification and collection. Subsequently, the firm submitted various pieces of evidence and applied for reconsideration. The meeting again decided to review the case and sent a letter to your association to temporarily suspend the disposal of the goods. Now, the 19th executive committee, based on the review report, has repeated its decision as follows: "The goods detained by the Anti-Japanese and Aid Overseas Chinese Association on August 15 were confiscated and allocated to flood relief based on the standards set by the Anti-Japanese Association in the 17th year of the Republic. On October 24, the firm submitted various pieces of evidence and stated its objections. After reviewing the evidence, the staff of this association found that the evidence of purchasing goods from the Netherlands was reliable. However, the firm did not submit sufficient evidence before the decision to confiscate the goods and falsely claimed to be eastern flour to seek high profits. All responsibilities should be borne by the firm. Since the detained goods have been allocated for disaster relief, the firm can donate 40,000 yuan to offset the relief funds to benefit the disaster victims. The original goods should be retrieved from the Relief Committee." The minutes were recorded and a letter was sent to Yuanlaihang.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Temple Fair to be Held as Usual This Year</h3>
<p>Public Works Department Has Devised a Solution</p>
<p>Shorten Temple Fair Period to Seven Days</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple in this city is usually held during the temple fair period from the first to the tenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. During these nine days, vendors gather and tourists crowd the area, causing traffic to be blocked. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession has long had the determination to ban it. The temple fair this year is approaching again, and the Public Works Department has repeatedly ordered the abbot of Jing'an Temple to strictly prohibit it. However, due to the difficulty of eliminating customs and the fact that most of the poor vendors rely on this nine-day temple fair to make a living for the year, the abbot of Jing'an Temple went to the Public Works Department three times to ask for a compromise. It is now known that both parties have discussed and resolved to shorten the nine-day temple fair to seven days. As for vendors setting up stalls, they are limited to the sidewalks and must not encroach on the roads to impede traffic. The entrances of shops on both sides must also leave sidewalks for pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Worker Beaten by Japanese Police Interrogated by Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Worker Imprisoned for Settling Wages</p>
<p>Since the Japanese-owned yarn factory in Shanghai has been affected by the boycott, many have been unable to maintain operations. At the end of last year, the Tongxing No. 1 Factory at No. 181 Gordon Road dismissed most of its workers, forcibly canceled the usual monthly bonus, and retained only a few workers to carry out the work. From the 9th of this month, they also implemented a go-slow. At around 2 pm the day before yesterday, workers sent representatives to the factory to negotiate. The Japanese ordered Japanese policeman No. 54 to beat three workers to the ground, a local worker named Gu Guisong and two workers from Yancheng, Gu Shichang and Chen Deyu. They also reported to the Gordon Road Police Station by telephone and sent Western policeman No. 244 to arrest the three workers and take them to the police station. Since they were all injured, they were sent to the hospital for treatment. Gu Guisong and Gu Shichang suffered minor head injuries and were discharged from the hospital immediately after being bandaged by the doctor. They were sent to the Simple Court of the First Special Court yesterday. Qian, the police station representative, presented the case and stated that the third defendant, Chen Deyu, was being treated in the hospital due to more serious injuries, and that two Japanese workers had been beaten by the remaining workers and Japanese policeman No. 54 had also been injured and were not present in court, so he requested a postponement. When questioned, the defendants Gu Guisong and Gu Shichang confessed that they had gone to the factory to settle their wages yesterday and were insulted and scolded by the Japanese, and ordered the Japanese police to beat them down with wooden sticks, which angered the workers and caused them to throw stones. Judge Jiang ordered them to be taken back into custody and would investigate after Chen Deyu had recovered.</p>
<h3>Rongchangxiang Sues Cheng Linsheng</h3>
<p>Judge Orders to Find a Way to Settle</p>
<p>After the tenants failed in the Yixinli Eviction Lawsuit, Rongchangxiang, one of the tenants, had advanced more than 70,000 yuan in construction fees for the landlord, Cheng Linsheng. At that time, the landlord had verbally agreed that after the expiration of the lease, he could renew it for a period of seven years. Therefore, Rongchangxiang hired lawyers Ye Fukan and Yu Hualong to file a counterclaim with the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren held a hearing. Cheng Linsheng appointed lawyer Liu to appear in court. Judge Zhou said that if the case continued to be litigated, it would be better to settle it, so as to avoid many complications. Therefore, he instructed lawyer Liu to advise Cheng Linsheng to show a slight retreat and consider renewing the lease so that the case could be resolved. Lawyer Liu said that he could accept the court's intention and discuss it with the landlord. Judge Zhou then ordered the case to be postponed for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Continued Opposition from Various Industries to the Strike</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a circular to various trade associations in the city seeking opinions on the strike, all trade associations believe that this is the time for merchants to make major year-end settlements. A sudden strike will plunge commerce into a state of irreversible ruin. They have expressed unanimous opposition and have sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce urging them not to implement it. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the chamber received the following list of associations opposing the strike yesterday: Shaoxing Wine Industry, Dried Goods Industry, Fur Industry, Fresh Pork Industry, Noodle Industry, Shoe Industry, Silk Braid Industry, Military Uniform Industry, Sausage Industry, Sugar Industry, Watch and Clock Industry, Chinese Candle Industry, Tea Industry, Clothing Industry, Stapler Industry, Color Printing Industry, Machinery Industry, and Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry.</p>

<h3>Japanese Exclude Chinese Seafarers</h3>
<p>Zhengji Company Also Dismisses Chinese Employees</p>
<p>Dalian Stops Employing Chinese Seafarers: Steamboat sailors and firemen on Japanese merchant ships in Dalian Bay, who have traditionally employed Chinese seafarers, have recently decided, since our country's boycott of Japanese ships, after a meeting by Japanese merchant ships in the port, to dismiss all Chinese sailors and firemen employed on the ships starting this month, and replace them with Japanese. The Dalian Steamship Company is the first to implement this, and replacements are already underway. Other Japanese ships are following suit. It is estimated that at least a thousand Chinese seafarers in Dalian will lose their jobs due to the Japanese exclusion.</p>
<p>Zhengji Employs Japanese: Our country's Zhengji Steamship Company has a great deal of influence in North China. Previously, its shipowners and crew were mostly Japanese. Later, due to the gold standard, Chinese personnel were hired. Recently, however, due to the reduction in the price of gold notes, the company has resumed successively dismissing Chinese crew members and replacing them with Japanese. The other day, the Fuli vessel suddenly dismissed Wang Gongrang, a senior engineer, and forcefully dispatched a Japanese to the ship, causing opposition from the crew. However, General Manager Zhang Zhengben disregarded everything and replaced all senior crew members on all twenty-three ships with Japanese. Currently, more than eighty people have been hired. The dismissed crew members have returned south to Shanghai. Recently, the company has also submitted a request to the Ministry for the issuance of shipowner licenses to Japanese personnel. The Ministry rejected the request. The company submitted a second request, stating that there is a lack of qualified Chinese navigators and that it is necessary to employ Japanese personnel. This matter has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>After the Labor Unrest in Japanese Textile Factories</h3>
<p>Trends in Labor and Management</p>
<p>More than thirty Japanese-owned textile factories in this city, including Rihua and Tongxing (both internal and external), employing more than 60,000 Chinese workers, have been embroiled in a labor strike triggered by opposition to the cancellation of monthly bonuses. Workers from the Xihe factory also joined the strike group yesterday. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Chamber of Commerce Meeting: The Shanghai Japanese Textile Factory Association has not only wired detailed information on the strike to the Osaka Textile Committee for instructions and remedial measures, but has also sent circulars to representatives of all factories in Shanghai, scheduling a representative assembly to seek a fundamental solution.

<h3>Chinese Students Do Not Apply to the Spirit of "The Last Lesson" Zhou Jingxiang</h3>
<p>But do not engage in reckless actions that are exploited by others.</p>
<p>National salvation must come from practical material aspects.</p>
<p>Today, reading Mr. Wang Maoxun's three answers, especially regarding the question of students, using the history of the French "The Last Lesson" as an example, he believes that Chinese students should also adopt this attitude and does not agree with strike actions. After reading it, I feel that there are different opinions.</p>
<p>Originally, the calm attitude of French students is indeed worthy of our admiration. Of course, it would be best if we in China could also have these examples. However, in reality, even if our students can do it, the environment in our country simply won't work. Just look at the current national crisis. Where have the authorities shown any active expression? The country raises millions of soldiers, but when foreign enemies invade, they only know how to retreat without resistance. Within a day, thousands of miles of land are lost, creating a strange story unheard of in the world. At this time of national demise, fortunately, we have passionate young students who sacrifice their precious study time, fearlessly and tirelessly, to shout out and awaken our compatriots. China has a large population, but many are numb and apathetic. Without such shouting, many sleeping lions cannot be awakened. This time, our people have shown a strong sense of national spirit. Unfortunately, the authorities are brave in internal strife but cowardly against external enemies, betraying the patriotic heart of the people. But these spirits will not diminish, and the unity of these spirits is greatly due to the students. Perhaps some people say that now that the noise is over and the fuss is over, what is the reality? The land is still lost, the humiliation is still humiliation, the authorities are still not awake, and the internal strife is still intense. Students, they have only sacrificed their studies. This is indeed reasonable, but on the other hand, if there had been no enthusiastic student movement this time, the national spirit of China would have been even more dead. Don't even mention foreigners occupying the three northeastern provinces; even when they reach Tianjin, many people are still numb. In China's environment and under China's authorities, we can only recognize the young students. We urgently need young students to stand up and shout, and even more need students to have active movements. "The Last Lesson" cannot exist in China. France has responsible troops and a responsible government. They will not make the students anxious, nor will they make the students panic. Therefore, even though the Prussian army is sounding the horn, they are still studying. Even though the front line is fighting, they are still studying. What about China? Don't even mention stopping. Our blood is hot and boiling. We cannot be so calm and sit idly by as our country is broken and the map changes color! My meaning is that French students have the French environment, and Chinese students must not imitate this calm spirit of "The Last Lesson." However, meaningless, reckless actions that are exploited by others should be carefully noted. At the same time, we should work hard in science and save the country from a practical material perspective. (Ding)</p>

<h3>Seeking Knowledge to Save the Country · Filth</h3>
<p>X Can striking really save the country?</p>
<p>Yesterday at a friend's place, I saw a notice that XX</p>
<p>University sent to the students' families. I have already forgotten the wording of the letter. I still remember the general meaning of the letter:</p>
<p>"If students want to engage in patriotic movements, please do not come to the school to study. If you come to the school to study, you are not allowed to engage in patriotic movements anymore."</p>
<p>At that time, when I saw this letter, I felt greatly unfair for the students. Is it that once they study, they are not allowed to be patriotic? Is it that once they study, they are taught to be docile slaves?</p>
<p>Later, I thought about it and there was some reason:</p>
<p>Is the patriotic movement the only career that students can do? Can't you engage in patriotic movements if you are not a student? If you can engage in patriotic movements even if you are not a student, then why must students engage in patriotic careers?</p>
<p>Now that the country is in crisis, students should quickly abandon their books and thoroughly engage in the cause of the patriotic movement. When the lost territory in the Northeast is completely recovered and Japanese imperialism is overthrown, it will not be too late to go back to school to study.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the title of "student" cannot be casually added. It comes from the huge tuition fees sacrificed by fathers and brothers. Now, sacrificing huge tuition fees and not going to school, but specializing in patriotic movements, is not a concern for wealthy and affluent families. I am afraid that it is not easy for ordinary middle and lower-class families to come up with such large tuition fees, is it? If the country is loved, what about the family?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the will of the students in each school, or the students in one school, may not be completely consistent. Some take patriotism as a prerequisite, and some must take studying as a prerequisite. Now, because students who advocate patriotism as a prerequisite go to engage in patriotic movements, the time, economy, and studies of students who advocate studying as a prerequisite are all sacrificed, which is not justifiable in terms of emotion and reason.</p>
<p>To be more thorough, the families of a few wealthy students do not care about these small tuition fees. They may as well allocate these tuition fees to patriotic movement expenses, or to earthquake relief funds after the great flood in the country last year, when mourners are still everywhere. It can also make the general hunger people grateful and tearful. Or, it may as well take these tuition fees to the Bund to skim water slices and watch the water flowers. It is not impossible. Why must it be sent from the "school store"?</p>
<p>Some say that students' patriotic movements have a background. Some say that students' patriotic movements have other reasons. There is no need to discuss these gossips. Now what I want to ask:</p>
<p>"What is a school? What do students actually learn in school?"</p>
<p>Do students want to engage in patriotic movements? Go ahead and do it, go ahead and do it thoroughly, but there is no need to waste useless tuition fees. Do students want to study? Go ahead and study, go ahead and work hard to study, and then go ahead and do patriotic careers after you have finished studying.</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, Mr. Cai Yuanpei had two sentences: Love the country without forgetting to study, study without forgetting to save the country. Ah! These are really deceiving words.</p>

Filling method: Use small pliers to hold the tube, and use a small piece of wrapping paper to roll a small funnel (large at the top and pointed at the bottom, leaving a tiny hole at the tip) on the mouth of the tube (do not block the mouth of the tube when inserting the funnel, so that air can escape). Then, drip the sulfuric acid drop by drop onto the funnel in order to fill it. After filling, seal the mouth of the tube with wax oil (both ends of the tube must be sealed tightly to prevent sulfuric acid from leaking).</p>
<p>Put a spoonful of potassium chlorate (kclo3) and a spoonful of sugar together and mix them together. Use a thin sheet of paper six inches long and three inches wide (feet) to spread the mixture on one end of the paper (spread two inches long and three inches wide). Then, cover the entire tube with the glass tube that has been filled with sulfuric acid, and tightly roll it into a cylinder. Tighten the remaining paper at both ends to prevent the mixture from leaking. Then, place it on the ground: Use a small hammer to break it at one end so that the sulfuric acid flows out. It will immediately make a crackling sound and start to burn, emitting green-white light.</p>
<p>Sulfuric acid encounters the mixture of potassium chlorate and sugar, which generates extremely high heat and releases a large amount of oxygen, burning the paper. Not only that, its flame is so fierce that the small glass tube will be completely vaporized.</p>

<h3>Various Ways of Life (3) Xingzi</h3>
<p>It was on a summer evening last year, I was walking with two or three friends barefoot on the road next to the French Park to enjoy the cool air. It was already midnight, and pairs of young men and women were being spewed out of the park’s mouth with tired expressions on their faces. The women were all like tame cats, gently embraced under the arms of the men. A breeze swept across every delicate white face, and everyone wore an uncontainable rosy smile. Amidst the group that was letting out soft smiles and sweet whispers, there was a serious groan, which was truly a disturbing sight. I don’t know what kind of psychology made me unable to stop and take a look.</p>
<p>The matter was like this: a man close to fifty was carrying an old woman close to seventy on his back. For every step he took, the man let out a labored gasp, and the old woman let out a low groan. The light shone on their faces, which were simply frighteningly pale. I asked the man, "Why are you carrying such an old person on the road at this late hour?"</p>
<p>So he put down the old woman on his back, his eyes filled with pleading tears, and said haltingly in Hankou dialect: "My original residence is in Hubei. She is my old mother. I originally opened an umbrella shop at Lao Ximen. Unfortunately, there was a fire the night before, and everything was burned. Now there is no place to live. I want to go back to Hankou, but I don't have travel expenses. We haven't eaten for two days. Alas, I am not enough to be pitied, only my old mother is suffering!"</p>
<p>"Do you smoke opium?" I asked him again with suspicion and disbelief.</p>
<p>"Where did you hear that? Sir, I am a well-behaved merchant!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man wearing short clothes walked out from the side. He said to himself, "That's true. The fire at the XX umbrella shop in Lao Ximen was something I saw with my own eyes the day before yesterday. It was a really tragic fire."</p>
<p>The words of this man in short clothes dispelled all my doubts and made me feel great sympathy and pity for the unfortunate victim, especially for the dying old woman. I immediately ran back to my residence and brought all my money to him. Still feeling that it was not enough, I borrowed some more from friends to make up the number. Finally, I called a rickshaw for him and told him to temporarily find a small hotel to stay overnight that night and then find a way to return to Hankou.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Stories (9) Compiled and Translated by Zhou Rong</h3>
<p>X First Land Management Regulations</p>
<p>In 1845, Gong Mu Jiu, the Daotai of Songjiang and Taicang, and the British Consul Balfour negotiated and formulated the Land Regulations for the Concessions. These regulations had a significant impact on the subsequent management laws of the international society in the Concessions.</p>
<p>The scope of the Concessions was redefined, and the western boundary was expanded to Changbang, which is now Fujian Road. Foreigners in the Concessions were not allowed to hire police officers, but they could hire bodyguards with the permission of the government. Chinese people were prohibited from living in the Concessions. Furthermore, Chinese people in the Concessions were prohibited from renting houses to Chinese people and were not allowed to renovate houses for rent to Chinese merchants. These Land Regulations completely excluded the influence of Chinese people in the Concessions, and the Chinese people could not set foot in their own country and were subjected to foreign control.</p>
<p>All landlords and major property owners in the Concessions were responsible for maintaining the Concessions and began to collect house donations to cover the costs of all public undertakings in the Concessions. A Roads and Jetties Committee was organized by merchants within the Concessions designated by the British Consul (whether the original Chinese translation was the Roads and Jetties Committee is still to be investigated). They were responsible for collecting taxes, and all tax expenditures were managed by all the local people and landlords. Except for the British, all other foreigners had to abide by these Land Regulations. Therefore, these regulations could only be modified with the consent of Chinese officials and the British Consul.</p>
<p>Within the Concessions, four major roads had been completed. These four roads are now Hankou Road, Jiujiang Road, Nanjing Road, and Beijing Road. These four roads are all east-west parallel lines and are still the most prosperous central areas in the Public Concession. Jiujiang Road is the widest, at twenty-five feet, and the other three roads are each twenty feet wide.</p>
<p>X Establishment of the French Concession</p>
<p>After the establishment of the British Concession in Shanghai, the United States and France sent people to Guangzhou to request the establishment of new concessions. With the permission of the Guangdong Governor Qi Ying, the first French Consul in Shanghai, M. Montigny, agreed with the Daotai of Songjiang and Taicang, Mr. Lin, on April 6, 1849, to establish the French Concession. It extended south to the Chenghuang River (now MinGuo Road), east to the Huangpu River, west to Guandi Temple River, and north to Yangjingbang.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the French Concession, French imperialists, like British imperialists, excluded all other labor from setting foot in the Concession. Therefore, Chinese officials and officials of any other country could not interfere in matters within the French Concession.</p>
