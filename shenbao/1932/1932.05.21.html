<p>九一八禍變突發。使寗粤對峙之局。得以由所謂統一和平之會議。趨於緩和。而成相安於一時之局面。然而以權勢之競奪。其相互間之利害衝突仍終始存在特以格於外交上之惡劣情勢。與國内之輿論。故但暗中鈎心鬥角。積極醖釀待機而發之混亂初未敢立即變爲明爭。今上海中日停戰方始成議。而内爭之徵兆。乃又日趨顯明。粤中風雲。頓形緊張。由於表面之海空軍改編問題。己引起嚴重之局勢。目前海軍己獨立於獲州陳濟棠將明令討伐。内亂之作。顯然又將無可避免。而另一部分軍人。則復高唱不參加對内作戰。欲以博取國人之好譽。表面上雖若言之成理然究其内容。要各有其背景與立塲。惟是二十年來。除自十五年國民革命軍北伐。以至統一之短時期中。曙光一現外。軍閥起伏。相繼戰亂。往復不斷此一幕循環不絶之歷史悲劇誠使吾人痛心疾首。仰天泣血而莫可如何。故今日而聆軍人不再參加内戰之呼聲。姑無論其爲眞爲僞。我人民視之。固亦己彌覺其可貴可喜。而表示深切之同情。獨是吾人認爲今日而欲根本消滅内戰不在消極之「不參加」尤不在於表面之「不參加」之宣傳。二十年來循環起伏之戰亂誰不有可以假借之口實。更誰不謂戰爭爲出於萬不獲己。所謂「忍無可忍。」「忍涙揮戈。」己成爲刻版之文告。此其間蓋己無是非無曲直。己成軍閥混戰之局面絶不以一部分人之不參加而遂終止抑且彼唱不參加内戰之宣傳。怜爲一種戰術。至爲顯然。不肯犧牲其地位。不肯放棄其權利各擁勁旅。各立門戸。軍爲個人之軍。利亦爲一己之利。則權利之慾念激於内。帝國主義者誘於外即欲不戰亦不可得。所謂不參加内戰特欺人之籍而己。故吾人對於今日劍拔弩張之粤中緊張局勢。當明其因果。而對於不再參加内戰之宣傳。亦不存若何之欣喜。蓋問題之路結實不在此而在彼。軍閥制度一日不推翻。内亂决一日無由止息也。</p>
<p>吾人對於非戰一主張之態度。前在「廣國内非戰運動」一評中。旣己定之。軍人今日而眞大澈大悟。知往者之非則救國之道不復在於消　之不參加内戰而己。</p>

<p>日本蘇維埃化</p>
<p>懼與美太平洋戰時乘機搗亂</p>
<p>使大和日本變爲蘇維埃日本</p>
<p>故欲在未戰時先與蘇俄妥協</p>
<p>大阪朝日新聞十三日發表大竹博吉論文、詳述蘇俄與日本之關係、力主緩和蘇俄之反日空氣、並論日美萬一發生戰爭、俄國所採之態度、極爲扼要、際此極東情勢瞬息萬變之時、美俄對日之態度、與日本應付美俄之策略、均爲關心時局者所注意、故特譯出、以備未來大局變化之參考、全文如次、</p>
<p>日本與蘇俄聨邦之關係、觀最近空氣、漸由緊張而呈弛緩之狀、吾日本與蘇俄一戰之意見、尙未至清算時期、故應力避兩　之衝突、即蘇聨挑戰、亦願退避三舍、自田中視察滿洲回國發表意見後、政府方面、亦傾於對俄軟化、蓋自滿洲事變以還、日本在滿建設事業前途、雖發生種種困難、然蘇維埃政府、在此第一次五年計畫甫告成功中、而國内建設、尙有無數障碍、迄未着手清除、故在此期内、一旦與日本發生衝突、其有害無益、亦爲世人所共知、况日俄兩國發生衝突後、勢必牽動全世界、捲入戰爭漩渦中、處如此重大責任之日俄兩國政府、當不敢輕率進行、冒此大不韙、事實上旣有如此重大的危險性、則由現今兩國之立塲觀之、其不致發生衝突、自可大明矣、</p>
<p>然而今日兩國之關係、未能安定者、究何在哉、良以滿洲事變起後、其間所發生之各種問題、常爲雙方所疑忌、如欲清除此疑忌、除安定日俄兩國間之關係外、别無具體的重大方策、而安定日俄兩國之法、第一須先確立日俄間之協調、</p>
<p>溯去年九月滿洲事變勃發之時、余適旅行於蘇維埃聨邦、彼邦政府與一般社會、對於事變之態度、就當時僑居於蘇維埃聨邦各外國人間推測、咸傳日俄己有密約、但當時日本朝野、以爲阻碍在滿之行動、實在蘇俄、以後事變逐漸推移、蘇俄態度、益爲愼重、而我國人亦不審蘇俄所持之態度、遂致赤軍集中極東邊境、當時日本朝野、突聞赤軍東移、殆若晴天霹鑿、因在極東兵備單薄的時代、表面上裝作和平與嚴正中立之蘇俄、今日忽一變爲積極態度、世人因之頓起不安、此日本對蘇俄疑忌之所由來也、</p>
<p>雖然、在蘇俄方面增兵極東、不爲無理、彼以爲白系俄人受日本公然或秘密的援助、企圖擾亂極東、故蘇俄不得不有所防備、其中蘇俄對日、更有感覺不安者、即曩時芳澤大使、途次莫斯科時、俄政府曾表示互不侵犯條約問題、德魯諾夫司克大使亦提議該問題之意旨、乃其時日本對此提議、認爲無締結之必要、因此蘇俄遂疑日本具有他種野心、吾人以爲苟在極東别無他意、亟應一掃俄國之誤解也、次之日本對於中東路聲明尊重蘇俄方面之利益、目下中東路沿缐、被僱於滿洲方面之白系俄人、任警察官與其他職務等、頗爲活動、鐵道從業員中之脅迫蘇俄人民、時有所聞、此次白系俄人轟炸軍用列車事件、蘇俄與日本之關係、突然惡化、此種白系俄人之煽動行爲、（記者按中東路軍用列車爆炸一案、日方曾指赤俄所爲、今忽謂爲出於白俄之煽動、殊爲可異、）幾致日俄兩國發生衝突、</p>
<p>當時蘇俄對此問題　與中東路之一般問題、己準備與日本折衝、以爲日本此種未顯然表明正式程序的行動、獲得俄國之容許、而竟一意孤行、殊難容忍、故俄國對日之疑忌心、極爲濃厚、幸最近兩國之當事者、努力避免衝突、形勢漸趨和緩、際此時機、日本與蘇俄、應將滿洲問題、披誠相商、俾蘇俄對日之疑團、渙然氷釋也、</p>
<p>惟吾人默察俄國之内情、實有極可危懼之點、即日本在太平洋上倘與美國開戰時、蘇俄必從背後、乘虛企圖破滅日本、計畫擾亂日本國内、使日本全國陷於赤化之局面、蓋蘇俄利用日美戰爭之好機會、冀日本戰敗時、可乘日本民心之混亂、猛烈宣傳日本赤化、以期逹到世界革命之目的、因此有一部分人、多主張在日美開戰以前、應先痛擊蘇俄、以絶後顧之患、</p>
<p>至於日美戰爭、由俄國政治家之觀察、係帝國主義與帝國主義之衝突、俄國如積極的援助一方、使他國得勝、原亦違反蘇俄建國之精神、但蘇俄乘日美戰爭之機會、衝日本之背後、使「大和日本」一變而爲「蘇維埃日本」一點、則吾人難保其不如此、彼時日本之形勢、背後之敵、比較前面之敵、必增加百倍的脅威與憎惡、日本人的國民感情、究將如何被動、亦不得而知、恐日本政府、不待澈底的敗戰、己不得不先與前面之敵講和矣、此時資本的祖國亞美利加、見日本己成蘇維埃化則將一變其計劃、聨合與反蘇維埃之西歐各國、共同立在一條戰線上、以與蘇維埃一决雌雄、故蘇俄之此種政策、亦甚冒險也、</p>

<h3 id="c176">蘇敎廳草擬 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<h3 id="c177">三年敎育計畫（一） <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>江蘇省敎育近年困于經費、未能進展、而辦理敎育者、亦復借敎育爲飯碗敷衍了事、行政機關終年包圍、於對付索欵者之麻煩、己失其督察推進功能周佛海自任廳長以來、對於省立敎欵及整頓地方敎育己稍見成效、茲復有三年計畫之動議、茲覓得草案大意錄之如次、</p>
<h3 id="c178">第一目標 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>本計劃之目標求於三年之短促時間、收下列之效果、即（一）使學齡兒童增加入校之機會、每年减少失學兒童百分之五、（二）使一般不識字之成人增加識字機會、每年减少文盲百分之十、（三）使學校畢業之學生而欲服務社會者、人人有健全之服務能力及公民應具之修養、（四）使畢業學生而欲升學者、人人有升學之學力、</p>
<h3 id="c179">第二　内容 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>欲使學齡兒童增加入學之機會、則應積極普及敎育、欲使義務敎育眞能普及、則師資之造就、又爲先决條件、欲使畢業學生有健全之服務能力、則應充實職業學校之内容、欲使不識字之文盲逐年减少、則識字敎育之實施、更應努力、欲使畢業生有升學之能力、則中學程度應謀提高、是故、一·普及義務敎育、二·擴充師範、三·充實職業敎育、四·提高中學程度、五·勵行識字敎育、實爲本計劃之中心事業、</p>
<h3 id="c180">第三　根據 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>查蘇省敎育經費、在敎育方面、有忙漕附稅屠牙各稅、年收約二百八十萬元、而中央大學經費又己於本年度劃歸中央、苟額徵之數、能如數實收、則專門敎育職業敎育師範敎育社會敎育、儘可充實内容並謀發展、至於地方敎育方面、全省各縣敎費總額己逹一千二百餘萬元、雖每年秋勘實徵數、常與額徵有差、但若就實收數平均在六成以上計算、則每年至少亦當在七百五十萬以上再就敎育事業而言、省立機關則有中學二十一所、師範部十六所、專門學校二所、鄉村師範六所、實騐小學十五所、職業學校四所、其在各縣、則有中學七十餘所、師範四十八所、小學綜計爲一三七五六級、入學兒童約五十八萬餘人、失學兒童仍有三百九十九萬五千二百九十六人左右、至於不識字之文盲二千五百萬人、與人口三千二百萬相比、幾逹百分之八十、然統觀近年來蘇省敎衣實己呈疲弊之狀態、綜其原因、約有二端、一·因省經費及地方經費、久有虛收實支之弊、更復整理無方、諸弊百出、而地方經費之浮濫紊亂、更屬不可爬梳、又值災祋兵禍、重叠而來、於是省縣各地經費、積欠悉逹巨萬、稽核不易羅掘無方、維持現狀、己屬困難、更何擴充之可言、此則因經費困難而無由發展者也、二·因地方經費、積欠過多、敎育人員均感不安、加以派别分歧、各立門戸、傾軋排擠、明爭暗鬥、於是控告局長、包圍敎局、毆打局員、罷敎索薪、竟成常習地方敎育之紛亂、幾陷於不可收拾之境、此又因人事糾紛而使地方敎育日益敗壞者也、蘇省敎育現狀、旣屬如此、則圖立一切實之計劃、對於應整理者、自應厲行整理、而亟須發展者、應力謀擴充、故本計劃之施行、必須劃分一定之步驟、</p>
<h3 id="c181">第四　步驟 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>蘇省敎育、目前旣呈疲弊之象、非從各方面切實整理、則基礎無由穏定、基礎不固、而侈言進展、必致徒事紛紜、而無實效、故必須先行切實整理、然後再就目前省與地方經濟之可能範圍内、謀逐步之擴充、故本計劃之施行步驟、定第一年爲整理時期、第二第三兩年則爲擴充時期、</p>
<h3 id="c182">第一年整理時期 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>在本期實行整理計劃時、除敎育廳爲從各方面切實整理起見、業經製定「縣長辦學考成辦法」「敎育局長考核章程」以考核敎育行政人員、頒佈各縣敎費「辦理預算規程」以袪除虛收實支之弊、改訂「敎育局組織規程」以節省行政經費、舉行特殊視察、以澈底辦理糾紛最大縣份之敎育、劃分舊欠新收、確定清償舊欠辦法、以利敎育事業之進行、並嚴令各縣敎育局剔除浮濫開支、對於交代未清之敎局、限期嚴催趕辦交代外應施行左列各項</p>
<p>一、整理各項經費來源</p>
<p>（甲）商定協徵方法　各縣糧櫃對于徵收舞弊、己成習慣、故應與財政廳協商、妥定協徵方法、藉杜糧櫃隠瞞拖欠之弊、</p>
<p>（乙）整理學田學租敎育捐稅及整理屠牙各稅各縣學田學租、積弊亦深、亟應切實整理、並酌量增加租額、即敎育捐稅、亦有整理增加之餘地、本省屠牙各稅、若能再加整頓、尙有增加之可能、三項整理及增額之收入、應定爲充實各縣義務敎育社會敎育内容之用、</p>
<p>二、增加全省小學各學級之人數</p>
<p>查蘇省全省小學校數、合計爲八一九九校、學級數爲二三七五六級、每學級人數、平均計算、約爲四○强、每級均應增足爲五十人、照原學級則本年度即可增收學齡兒童十三萬七千五百六十人、</p>
<p>三、改良小學敎學方法</p>
<p>應督促各地小學校研究複式敎授與單級敎授、並設法組織講習會、或奬勵其人函授學校、</p>
<p>四、改良私塾</p>
<p>查本省入學兒童、雖經百分之十四强、但其就學私塾者、當亦不在百分之十以下、故在此義務敎育經費未能十分充裕之時、改良私塾、實爲急要之圖、應屬行私塾登記塾師登記及塾師檢定、務期逹到私塾學校化之目的、</p>
<p>五、整頓學風</p>
<p>糾正浮囂浪漫之氣習、養成純正好學之風紀、</p>
<p>六、積極改進師範敎育</p>
<p>查本省師範學校、省立中學師範部祇有十六處、省立鄉村師範只有六校、縣立師範有四十三校、每年畢業生、就省縣立各校合計、約有一千七百餘人左右、但其升學或改就他職者、己不乏人、縱令全數悉能服務小學、姑以一人敎一級計算則此一千七百餘人、分配於一三七五六學級、不敷之數實鉅、故在本期内、除由敎廳繼續施行小學敎員檢定、藉資救濟外、關於師範敎育之改進計畫、約有三項（甲）實行鄉村師範獨立、（乙）逐漸施行師範中學獨立、（丙）籌設師範專科學校、</p>

<p>第七回　干謁到豪門常使將軍顚倒　幽覊在情獄卒能夫婿牢籠</p>
<p>魏卓謀回答得最有趣。說是青年人之於愛情。誰都難免没有意外的遇合或波折。若遇有這等事。最好是順應自然。因爲世上决没有那種堅强的人。能抵抗得住那時代與命運的支配。倒不如藉此多多經歷世故。以求參透人生。而獲得最光明最智慧的了解與覺悟。像你們這段姻緣。以及你二人精進的合作。無無途徑如何。與將來演變得怎樣。總能在最後於我所說的那人生問題上。使心靈得有一種最微妙與最有價值的進益。我除了贊成以外。還有何說。况我又是原介紹人。更應擔任這個現成的月老。至於李問霞那一面。情緣旣不凑巧。原也就不必勉强。又未必就是伊的損失。我不信世上男女。誰非與誰成眷屬不可。也不是誰竟和誰硬不可做夫妻。順水流舟。聽其自然好啦。呌我勸勸伊。自信也勸得來。你二位放心吧。但梁笑雲患得患失的心忒重。終仍是費盡機靈的在盡力防閒。旣結了婚。成了禮。看守著安玉田還是寸步不離。又暗中呵囑好全宅僕役。似宣布戒嚴般那麽緊密。遇有什麽女人來找安先生。一律擋駕。外來信件統須先秘密交與伊仔細檢查。不得逕自遞上。直把安玉田當做個在軟禁中的情俘。今天是在第四日上。昨天又因是吉期忙碌得很疲乏。本不願就離開安玉田出去的。只爲打聽得葉作章行將出京歸任。再不趕去接洽。怕要誤了大事。才勉强上葉宅去一趙。臨出門又切實將家下僕役吩咐了一番。呌他們格外小心把守。並哄了安玉田許多話。說伊一會兒就回來。你好好在家裏歇著。千萬不可胡跑亂走。却不料伊一出門後竟躯擱了許多辰光。又明知危機是那樣多。他也生性好動。恐耐不住這寂寞。别要疏虞了這一刻兒。就無巧不巧的出了什麽差錯。所以芳心中卜卜亂跳的只在車裏發急其實伊却未免過慮。他在先與李問霞口頭訂婚。原只是出於一時的感情衝動。及被魏卓謀介紹見了梁笑雲。使他眼界中對於女性美又多一層藝術的精绖利緻的認識。己漸覺李問霞那種亂頭粗服。雖可曲解爲健康美及渾樸天眞。其實只是個鄉野的尋常的姑娘。絶不及梁笑雲的名貴。不過尙認梁笑雲爲高不可攀。未敢妄加追求才安於本分。仍敷衍維持著李問霞的舊約。</p>

<p>不拆姘頭，不算好漢，不閙離婚，不算闊人，男女離婚，原是現代最時髦而最有興趣的一套把戲，假定蔪然露頭角的一位時髦名人·猶擁着家中黃臉老婆去睡覺，這原非識時務的俊傑所爲，故欲做闊人，離婚原是必不可少的條件試看自近年以來，上至宣統廢帝，（去年大閙其與妾離異案）下至江北小三子小鴨子等，無一日不大閙其「拆姘頭」「講離婚」的勾當，幾位出風頭的大律師，吃飽了飯，專門去幹「拆鴛鴦分兩下裏」的這椿正經，江南名士多如　的律師，罩上牌頭，衣，食，住，行，四大問題，就此解决，</p>
<p>故欲做闊人，必定離婚，不去離婚，不能爲闊人，這算是現代金科玉律的兩句闊人佳話，</p>

<h3 id="c225">洋燭製造法（一） <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 允釐</p>
<p>洋燭是我們日常用品中一件重要的東西，這是誰都知道的。但是製造的原料和方法，可都知道呢？洋燭製造的方法是很簡單的。這種簡而易舉的家庭工業，是我國需要最迫切的。所以特來介紹一下。</p>
<p>（一）原料的選擇法</p>
<p>牛油。羊油，棕橺油，揶子油，　……本來都可以製造洋燭，但是這些油所製的洋燭，不甚良好。燃點時，不是有臭氣，就是發煤烟。所以現在各製造廠，爲免去這種弊病起見，就改用石蠟和斯的阿林蠟來製造洋燭了。因爲這兩種蠟所製的洋燭，不但是堅硬些，而又光潔可愛。燃點時，旣無煤烟，惡臭，和變彎曲等弊病，而且火光明亮些，又耐點些，所以頗受顧主的歡迎。</p>
<p>（甲）石蠟丨即巴辣芬，石油和木油中，都含有此蠟。取法··是將這兩種油蒸餾過的殘渣取出·加以硫强水，則油中所含的雜質，盡爲强水所消化，而石蠟便浮於水上，凝成固體，取出用清水洗滌便成了。</p>
<p>（乙）斯的阿林蠟丨多含於牛油和羊油中。取法··是先將水放入這兩種油中，然後同放入鍋内加熱，到油質完全融解時，再加入石灰乳用火煑沸，則油質被石灰的變化，而成鈣定油酸，和鈣流油酸互相凝結，上面浮有黃色的液體，就是斯的阿林蠟。以上二物，美國製的爲最好，美孚公司有出售。</p>
<p>（丙）燭芯丨可用極細的棉紗編成。但要注意，編時，必得要用藥水浸洗一次，使燭芯帶有鹻滷性，熄燭之後，燭芯亦隨之而滅，不致有燒入油内之患。燭芯不可過粗或過細。倘若過粗，則燃燒的火力太大，而所融的蠟，不敷吸收，因而發生煤烟，致洋燭不能耐點；若過細，則所融化的蠟，不能由燭芯盡行吸上，辇必由燭旁流下，更不經濟。</p>
<p>（二）原料的配合法</p>
<p>配合洋燭原料的分量，必須依春夏秋冬四季不同的温度而分别。夏季的温度最高，用巴辣芬八分半或九分，配以斯的阿林十分或十二分半；冬季温度最低，用巴辣芬九分或九分半，配以斯的阿林半分或一分；春秋二季，温度適中，用巴辣芬十分或十一分，配以斯的阿林七分或七分半。至於春末秋初，温度各有不同，配合分量·也隨之變更。總之，温度高，則多用斯的阿林。温度低，則多用巴辣芬。</p>
<p>分量的配和，與燭的優良，大有關係，上面配和的分量，是我實騐過的。讀者如能實騐出更優的配和法，也請發表於報端，以資研究而振興實業。茲限於篇幅，我明天再談製造洋燭的手續吧</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>遠涉萬里而來的輪船，因己快到目的地而漸漸地慢行起來了，乘通艙的Ｃ君，從對岸的隨風飄蕩的楊柳枝間，看見了高從天空的洋樓，寛大而平坦的馬路，來往如梭的電車汽車……他正在默誦着··「物質文明」，「文化中心」，「東亞第一繁華之區」等美稱，</p>
<p>船將靠攏而尙未靠攏××輪埠的時候，閧然一聲，忽由幾只小船上，搶上了許多穿着粗布短服的間或也羼雜着幾個毡帽長衣的人，没命的爭着，撲向旅客們面前，滿口高嚷着··「平安飯店」，「申江旅館」，「高陞棧，」「……」。</p>
<p>初從山國裏出來的Ｃ君，第一次看見這般情景正在考究着什麽一回事的刹那問，他的靠椅上和籐箱上，己經有人正弓着腰和貼膏藥般的糊上幾張彩色的隨圓形紙。</p>
<p>「一共幾件行李，先生？」那人伸直了腰，滿面堆歡似的說。</p>
<p>「大小四件」，Ｃ君無意識的順口答應他；同時，行李上糊着椭圓形紙上印着的「××旅社，房間寛大，價錢便宜……」的字樣，狠清爽的而且帶有引誘性的送到他眼睛裏。</p>
<p>「好！我們下船吧！」他一面說一面就拉着行李。</p>
<p>「不，我馬上就要搭車上南京！」</p>
<p>「也好！先到旅館去，揩把臉，洗」</p>
<p>個藻，休息休息，何况火車要……」</p>
<p>「阿三，快來！」於是又跑來了一個小伙子，他倆好像「打着洋財」似的，眼裏暗射出一種勝利之光，便把行李抬起就走，Ｃ君也只得跟起他們走！一上岸，就有好像特爲歡迎Ｃ君久候多時的馬車坐上拖起就跑，一會兒，就到了所謂寛大的整潔的旅社，原來是在一條弄堂裏廂！</p>
<p>c君果然也揩了把臉，還喝了杯汽水，吃了一頓飯，茶房便送上一個賬單。</p>
<p>尊賬計開··</p>
<p>房金　三元四角</p>
<p>客飯　五角九分馬車代墊　二元脚夫酒力代墊　一元六角汽水　三角巡捕捐　四角………　………</p>

<h3 id="c227">坐飛轎 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 心秀</p>
<p>我前天走訪一位老友Ｗ君，一見面，他就對我道，「來得眞巧，我正要告訴你，我有生以來，第一件闊的亨受！坐飛轎。」我聽了，莫明其妙的問道，「什麽？上海的闊老，也不過坐汽車，坐飛機罷了，你却從那裏玩起這新花樣來？怕是胡說吧？」</p>
<p>他道··「不，眞個是一般人所稱的飛轎，而且我坐的，還是四人飛轎哩！這種飛轎，越是逹官貴人，越没人請他坐，倒是一般鄉愚阿木林，却常有坐的資格，不過在我，還是破題兒第一遭，雖然難爲了十五塊錢，却多了一種見識他這一番話，更使我摸不着頭腦，忙請他解釋，究竟是什麽一同事，</p>
<p>他纔話歸正傳的道；「前夜我經過一條馬路，有幾個操皮肉生涯的她們，站在斜風細雨之中，淺綠的燈光，射在她的粉臉上，更顯得慘白可憐，我想同是圓顱方趾，她們竟長年在馬路上，餐風吸露的幹這下賤的勾當。不禁動了悲天憫人的觀念，把含有憐惜的眼光，對着她們痴呆地望了幾望，那知他們嚷着「去　丨去坐坐　！」大家一擁而上，前後左右，四個人把我架起，脚不落地的走進弄堂，我只得做了張學良的同志，任着她們擺佈。</p>
<p>她們把我拉到房裏，和我不三不四的絮聒着，又是茶啊，烟啊，瓜子啊，忙得個不亦樂乎，我都一槪拒絶，只閉着眼睛，老僧入定似的，置之不珮·她們忽然動手，替我脫桂，解衣，扯褲子………我到這時，倘再效張同志，便要失身了！我平生不到妓寮，守身如玉！忙竭力抵抗，她們才停止進攻道；「我們走罷，讓阿彩陪大少睡罷，時候不早了！」說着都出去了，只有一個嬌小伶瓏的她，房外也靜悄悄的，我便站起身來要走，起初她神氣活現的，把我當做俘虜般藍視着，後來看我態度强硬，她倒軟化　，只帶着乞憐的口氣道··」謝謝你，做做好事，在這裏住一夜，帮帮我的忙，免得她們怪我不會做生意，留不住客人，又要吃生活，儂譬如叉雀麻輸了，難爲三隻洋，在這裏將就一夜吧！」我聽她說得這樣可憐，便給她五塊錢，飛也似的，逃出了這人間地獄。</p>
<p>回來檢點夾袍裏的一張十塊錢鈔票，不翼而飛了！不知是給她們「抄八字」抄了去，還是推推扯扯的落掉了，也不去管牠，只算是十五塊錢的代價，坐一次飛轎罷了。」</p>
<p>我聽了默默地想，號稱文明的上海，爲什麽竟藏垢納汚地容許這般扛轎者，公然在馬路上，和綁票似的，拉行人「坐飛轎，」而不加以禁止呢？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Question of Soldiers Not Participating in Civil War <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The September 18th Incident suddenly erupted, allowing the confrontational situation between Nanjing and Guangdong to ease through a so-called unified and peaceful conference, achieving temporary harmony. However, the competition for power and the conflicts of interest between them remained constant. Especially constrained by the adverse diplomatic situation and domestic public opinion, they only engaged in covert struggles, actively brewing chaos while waiting for an opportunity to strike. They initially dared not immediately turn to open conflict. Now that the Sino-Japanese armistice in Shanghai has just been agreed upon, signs of internal strife are becoming increasingly clear. The situation in Guangdong is suddenly tense. The issue of reorganizing the naval and air forces on the surface has already led to a serious situation. Currently, the navy has become independent, and Chen Jitang of Guangzhou will issue a clear order to suppress it. The outbreak of civil strife seems inevitable again. Another group of soldiers is again clamoring not to participate in internal warfare, hoping to win the favor of the people. Although it seems reasonable on the surface, examining its content reveals that everyone has their own background and position. However, for the past twenty years, except for the brief period of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army from 1926 to the short-lived unification, a glimmer of dawn, warlords have risen and fallen, and wars have continued one after another. This recurring historical tragedy truly makes us heartbroken and unable to do anything but weep blood to the sky. Therefore, today, hearing the call for soldiers to no longer participate in civil war, regardless of whether it is true or false, our people view it as precious and pleasing, expressing deep sympathy. However, we believe that today, to fundamentally eliminate civil war, the solution does not lie in the passive "non-participation," nor in the superficial propaganda of "non-participation." Over the past twenty years of recurring wars, who does not have a pretext to borrow? Furthermore, who does not say that war is out of sheer necessity? The so-called "unbearable" and "wiping away tears to brandish weapons" have become stereotypical pronouncements. In this situation, there is no right or wrong, no truth or falsehood. It has become a chaotic situation of warlord infighting, which will not end simply because a portion of people do not participate. Moreover, the propaganda of not participating in civil war is obviously a kind of tactic. They are unwilling to sacrifice their positions, unwilling to give up their rights, each possessing strong troops, each establishing their own factions. The army is an individual's army, and the benefits are for oneself. When the desire for power is ignited internally and imperialists tempt them externally, even if they want to avoid war, it is impossible. The so-called non-participation in civil war is merely a pretext to deceive people. Therefore, we should understand the causes and consequences of the tense situation in Guangdong today, where swords are drawn and bows are strung. We should also not be overly pleased with the propaganda of no longer participating in civil war. The crux of the problem lies elsewhere, not here. Unless the warlord system is overthrown, there is no way to end internal strife.</p>
<p>Our attitude towards the non-war proposition was already determined in a previous commentary, "Guangdong's Domestic Non-War Movement." If soldiers today truly have a great epiphany and realize the mistakes of the past, then the way to save the country no longer lies in the passive non-participation in civil war.</p>

<p>Japanese Side Notifies of Continued Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Regarding the handover of the area north of the Zhabei Railway and the Zhenru area, the Japanese side has decided to hand it over to us for takeover on the 23rd. Therefore, the Takeover Committee specially convened a joint meeting yesterday with all relevant parties to discuss the takeover method. The committee also decided to send personnel to Zhabei this morning for inspection and to discuss the takeover procedures with the Japanese side. Yesterday, the Japanese members of the Joint Committee officially notified the Chairman of the Joint Committee, Cunningham, and our members, Yu Wen and Wen Yingxing, that they had decided to withdraw the Japanese troops from Yangxing on the 24th. At the same time, the Shizilin Fort, the Paotaiwan Barracks, and the Sanguantang Ammunition Depot will be handed over to us for takeover. The Takeover Committee has already assigned personnel to be responsible for the takeover. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, the Takeover Committee convened a joint meeting to discuss the method of taking over the area north of the Zhabei Railway (i.e., the jurisdictional scope of the Fourth District, Fifth District, and the Second Branch of the Fifth District).

The area extends east to the Yokohama River and the Songhu Railway, and southwest and north to Liuying Road, with the railway as the boundary on two sides. It has been agreed that the Japanese side will send personnel to discuss and inspect tomorrow (i.e., today) before the actual takeover, and to arrange everything. Today, a joint meeting is specially convened to discuss the takeover method. After Yin's report, everyone present decided that at 8:00 a.m. this morning, the Public Security and Public Utilities groups will go to Zhabei for inspection separately. The Public Security group will be responsible for discussing defense handover matters, and all public security and fire protection issues will be handled by the group. The Public Utilities group will be responsible for all administrative affairs related to water, electricity, transportation, telephone, street lights, and various municipal bureaus. They will gather and depart from the Lianshe at 8:00 a.m. today. The personnel for this task have been assigned. The Public Security group includes four members of the Takeover Committee: Special Commissioners Li Shengjun, Tao Xiaojie, and Cha Nanqiang; nine members of the Public Security Bureau: Huang Ming, Gong Xikui, Yin Tixin, He Yiming, Wu Shaolin, Niu Jingjian, Xia Qingyu, Lin Cishan, and Bao Ju; one member of the Defense Corps: Wang Binyan; and three members of the Fire Brigade: Dong Zhihe, Chen Yousheng, and Liang Huimin.

<h3 id="e4">The Takeover of Miaohang Announcement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee issued a statement yesterday regarding the takeover of Miaohang the day before yesterday, stating that at 7:00 p.m. on May 19, the personnel who took over Miaohang were Lu Fengpu, the second district chief of Baoshan County, Liu Guiting, the second branch chief of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, and Zhu Huang, the third squadron leader of the Capital Security Team. The Japanese troops in Miaohang had withdrawn four or five days earlier, and the Japanese side did not notify our side or the Joint Committee. Upon receiving the news, the committee was concerned that public security problems might arise in the area, and sent personnel to take over the area on the afternoon of the 19th. According to reports from the takeover personnel Lu Fengpu and others, Lu and Liu arrived in Dachang at 4:00 p.m., met with Squadron Leader Zhu Huang, and led a security team of 20 people, arriving in Miaohang at around 6:00 p.m. Because the houses in the town were all destroyed or occupied by refugees, making it impossible to station police, they were stationed at the Zhan Rice Mill in Zhancun, about half a mile west of the town. The area is still relatively peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Notification of Continued Withdrawal <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Okazaki Katsuo, the Japanese member of the Joint Committee (replacing Murai), officially notified Cunningham, the chairman of the Joint Committee, and our members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing yesterday that they had decided to completely withdraw the Japanese troops from Yangxing, Shizilin Fort, Paotaiwan Barracks, and the Sanguantang Ammunition Depot at 11:00 a.m. on the 23rd of this month. They informed our side to discuss the matter in advance so that the handover could be completed as scheduled. Regarding this matter, our Takeover Committee has already properly assigned receiving personnel to each location. Shi Ze will be responsible for taking over Shizilin Fort, Cao Jinbai will take over Paotaiwan Barracks, and Song Lichen will be responsible for taking over the Sanguantang Ammunition Depot. In addition, Liu Shouyu, Lin Tong, and Liu Xikang Renchu will assist in taking over the above-mentioned agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Sending Personnel to Inspect Zhabei <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed west of Songhu Road and north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in Zhabei are scheduled to withdraw on the 23rd. The Takeover Committee convened a meeting yesterday to plan the takeover. It was decided that personnel would be sent to inspect the Zhabei area first at 8:00 a.m. today and to discuss with the Japanese authorities in advance to make arrangements. According to investigations by the Hua Dong News Agency, the Japanese troops in Zhabei are scheduled to withdraw on the 23rd. However, in other locations, west of Songhu Road and south of the Yokohama River and Liuying Road, a portion of the area cannot be withdrawn immediately. The area accounts for approximately two-tenths of the entire Zhabei area.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Central Government Sends Personnel to Investigate <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Headquarters believes that since Shanghai has fallen and suffered severely from burning and killing, and a takeover is imminent, everything in the disaster area should be investigated clearly. Therefore, it sent Huang Ying, the director-general of the committee, and others to Shanghai to be responsible for investigating everything in the takeover area and the initial state of the takeover. Huang and others arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will go to various districts to inspect and take photos for propaganda purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Truth About the Japanese Handing Over Soldiers and Civilians <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>No Soldiers Were Captured During Combat</p>
<p>Civilians Were All Innocently Abducted</p>
<p>When our side took over Jiangwan on the 19th, we also received a total of 39 of our captured soldiers and civilians. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is still necessary to record the situation at the time of the takeover and the truth about the capture of our soldiers. The following is a supplementary account of the findings of the investigation: On that day, Shen Yi, the secretary of the 19th Route Army's Shanghai Office, accompanied Zhan Baoguang, the staff officer of the headquarters, and representatives from the municipal government, went to the North Station. The Japanese staff officer Tomita received them, handed over 39 prisoners and a roster, and asked Staff Officer Zhan to take them back. He said that these were all prisoners of your army. He said this with a smile, as if to show the attitude of a victor. Zhan replied that perhaps there were civilians mixed in and that names should be called to distinguish them. Tomita said that they were all your countrymen and that they should be taken back together. Zhan firmly refused and finally ordered the prisoners to line up and call out their names one by one. Then he asked the soldiers of the 19th Army and the 5th Army to step forward three steps. At that time, ten soldiers of the 19th Army stepped forward, and six soldiers of the 5th Army stepped forward. The rest remained still. Then Zhan said to Tomita, "These sixteen are our captured soldiers, and the remaining twenty-three are civilians." Then he led them to the reception center. These were the details of the handover of prisoners the day before yesterday. As for the truth about how the soldiers were captured, according to the soldiers, they were either hospitalized in the rear hospital in Nanxiang, or wounded on the front line, and were captured when the troops were withdrawn. According to the Wounded Soldiers Management Committee, these soldiers still need to be sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. From this, it can be seen that no one was captured during combat on the front line, and the civilians were all innocently abducted. The Japanese forced them to admit that they were plainclothes or new recruits. According to the captured soldiers and civilians, they were treated very harshly after being captured. The Japanese soldiers forced the soldiers to reveal our military secrets and beat them severely. The daily meals consisted of only two bowls of white porridge for breakfast and a rice ball for dinner.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Devastation of Miaohang After the Calamity <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Piles of Rubble, Traces of Battle Still Barely Discernible</p>
<p>Although the Cannons Have Ceased, the Loyal Sons Still Flow with Green Blood</p>
<p>Jin Mu's House, covering three hundred mu, the east end of Toutang Street, and the west end of Xitang Street, all in the vicinity of Miaohang Township, were the most fiercely fought areas during the war. Because the reporter of the New Voice News Agency learned that the Japanese army had withdrawn on the 18th and that our security team had also been stationed there, he specially drove to the area yesterday afternoon to see the real situation. The scene after the calamity was desolate and infinitely sad. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e10">A Glimpse Along the Way <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>At 1:00 p.m., turning north from the Zhabei Railway, we proceeded along Zhongshan Road. At the intersection with the railway, we first passed through a Japanese army post for inspection. After that, there were no major obstacles. There were still many pedestrians coming and going on Zhongshan Road. Then we proceeded south along the Shanghai-Taicang Road. The Japanese sentries had disappeared. However, there were more than 20 instances of telephone poles lying on the ground on both sides, seemingly sawn off by someone. When we arrived at Baohua Temple, the car could no longer proceed because the road ahead was narrow and we could only walk. So we abandoned the car and walked, and temporarily found a villager to lead the way. After about half a mile, we saw a chicken and duck company with about 20 or so houses, quite large in scale, now all destroyed by artillery fire. Only a small house at the rear end remains intact. Slightly to the northwest is the Hou Residence, all the houses of which have been reduced to rubble. According to the villagers, the destruction of the Hou Residence was caused by arson by the Japanese afterwards, which was also tragic. Along the way, we saw trenches about four or five miles long, most of which had been plowed and leveled by farmers, but the remaining traces were still faintly discernible. After proceeding for about four miles, we arrived at the Zhan Residence, which used to be the headquarters of a certain brigade of our Fifth Army. The houses have not been damaged much. Behind the back door of a press in the east, there is a communication trench leading directly to Miaohang, about three miles long, which has now been mostly filled in. After walking for another half an hour, we finally arrived at Miaohang.</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Tragic Situation in Miaohang <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The village of Miaohang has a total of 65 households, and the houses are all built along the Goose Creek. Fortunately, more than a dozen low houses and thatched huts in the west were not hit by artillery fire, and the villagers have also moved back. South of the creek is a small school called Goose Creek Elementary School, which used to have more than 50 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. The school affairs were quite developed in a small village. After this war disaster, the interior is empty, and the surrounding walls are dangerous. Only an outline remains, and the traces of bullets are as dense as a honeycomb. A dozen steps from the school is the Zhou Residence, which has been reduced to ashes. Next to it is the Wang Residence, which has a total of 34 houses, going straight to the Sicao Temple at the back. Now, however, all that can be seen is a pile of rubble, which has become a scorched earth. At that time, we met a Wang woman who had suffered. According to her, there were a total of five families with the same surname, with more than 20 houses, who were engaged in the oil pressing industry (i.e., pressing oil for others). During the previous emergency, they rushed out in a hurry, first to Luodian, and then fled east and west, passing through more than 20 places in the middle, experiencing all kinds of hardships and displacement. They finally arrived in Shanghai after many twists and turns. Now, the family is scattered, and she is alone. She only returned to her hometown a week ago to see it. However, the houses have been completely destroyed, with not a single tile to cover her body. The household goods have been lost without a trace. In a hurry, she tried to hire someone to build a small shack, which was only enough to accommodate her. Eating, drinking, and living are all done while sitting on the ground. Moreover, three family members died in the fire, one of whom was already 70 years old. As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes. The tragic state of her life truly made us unable to bear to hear it. The Sicao Temple (the name of Miaohang comes from this) on the southeast bank of the Wang Residence was the place where the two sides fought fiercely. The temple has a total of three rooms and three courtyards, and the villagers were very devout in worshiping and burning incense. Since the outbreak of the war, the temple has been the stronghold of our front line. Large trenches were built all around, and there are also traces of trenches along the east wall of the temple. The idols such as the Great Lord and the Third Lord have all had their hands and feet broken and are lying on the ground. When our army retreated, it was occupied by the Japanese army. The first squadron of the 9th Engineering Brigade of the Kanazawa Engineering Corps was stationed in the temple. When the Japanese army was stationed there, they broke a hole in the roof, supported it with three bamboo poles, and hung a Japanese flag on the top, which still exists. It is truly regrettable to see the enemy flag flaunting its power within our territory. There is an open space next to it. According to reports, when our army retreated, many of the dead were left behind and were burned and destroyed by the Japanese. Now, only black traces remain, left for us to mourn. About thirty steps from here is the Three Heroes' Tomb, which the Japanese often boast about. It is said that the Japanese army must visit this place every day to pray, rain or shine. I wonder what the Chinese people will think of the national soul in front of the Dachang Shanghai-Taicang Railway Station when they see this. About four miles east of the temple is Jin Mu's House, which was also the most fiercely fought battlefield at the time. Slightly to the north are East Tang Street and West Tang Street. Less than 20% of the houses in Jin Mu's House remain. East and West Tang Streets were completely destroyed by fire. Although the residents have returned one after another, they are only temporarily setting up temporary shelters. Three miles south of Miaohang is Sanbai Mu Tou, which used to be farmland. Later, a capitalist from Shanghai invested in purchasing 300 mu of land to build more than 40 houses, planning to build a new village there and open up roads that could lead to Shanghai. After this war, huge trenches, about four miles long, and newly built houses were the most severely damaged. At that time, blood filled the ditches and corpses were everywhere. Looking at it from a distance, it was almost like the fallen rice in the autumn harvest. The sight of it made us sad.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Our Police are Stationed <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army stationed there numbered only a hundred or so people, and they all suddenly withdrew on the 18th. At that time, our side immediately sent Wang Liansheng, the platoon leader of the third squadron of the first battalion of the Capital Security Team, along with 15 policemen, from Dachang. Because there was no way to station in Miaohang, they were temporarily stationed in the Zhan Residence. The area is now extremely peaceful. From yesterday onwards, they began to investigate the population.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Notice to Pacify the People <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Bian Yushan, the commander of the Capital Security Team, issued a notice to pacify the people, which read: "In view of the withdrawal of the Japanese army and the fact that this department has been ordered to take over the defense, all maintenance measures have been properly planned. All farmers, workers, and merchants should return to their homes as soon as possible and diligently pursue their occupations so as to restore the original state as soon as possible. However, after the war disaster, there may be unscrupulous villains, and there may be weapons left behind. It is not permissible to hide them privately. Please report to this department quickly, and rewards and punishments will be given separately. This is a sincere announcement. Please abide by it and do not forget."</p>

<p>After the Japanese army withdrew, they still came to inspect the area in groups of three or five on the day before yesterday and yesterday, and to pray at the Three Heroes' Tomb. At the same time, they completely removed the markers erected at the places where the remaining Japanese soldiers were buried. They did not come after 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Various Groups and National Salvation Associations Telegraphed Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to Inquire</p>
<p>The Shanghai Various Groups and National Salvation Joint Association held its 50th Executive Council meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, Chu Huiseng, Chen Peide, Chen Yafu, Shen Zurun, Huang Renzhi, Wang Aoxi, and others attended. Chu Huiseng was elected as chairman, and Shen Binfu took the minutes. The resolutions of the meeting were as follows: (1) Chen Peide and others responded to the assignment to investigate the case of Yongyuan Company purchasing Japanese goods and matches, stating that there was no evidence. The meeting decided to reply to the company with a slight warning. (2) Hu Zushun reported that the National Salvation Joint Association of Various Groups in Beiping was established on the 15th and resolved four important cases, as well as the situation of Japanese soldiers provoking trouble in Beiping for days. The meeting decided to reply by letter. (3) The Telegraph Workers' National Salvation Association stated that the Japanese intend to establish a free city in Shanghai and have obtained the support of various countries. Some Shanghai celebrities and landowners have also echoed this proposal. The meeting decided that according to the erroneous talk in today's newspaper about the British Overseas Association advocating a round table conference, the association should issue a declaration firmly opposing it and send letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Citizens' Association, the Bankers' Association, the Local Maintenance Association, the various Road Business Associations, the Lawyers' Association, etc., to unite in strong opposition. (4) On the issue of troops stationed in Southern Songjiang and Pudong, the meeting decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission to inquire about the situation and appointed Wang Aoxi to draft the telegram. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 p.m. The text of the telegram is recorded below: Urgent, Nanjing Executive Yuan Director Wang and Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, Since the signing of the armistice agreement, the Japanese side has widely spread the rumor that our side has acknowledged that troops will no longer be stationed in Southern Songjiang and Pudong. At that time, Director Wang and Foreign Minister Luo successively issued responsible statements denying this. This association also deeply believes this is not true. However, the armistice meeting record published in the Shanghai Evening Post on the 12th of this month clearly states that troops will not be stationed in Southern Songjiang and Pudong. Several days have passed, and the authorities have not denied this. The people of Shanghai are extremely alarmed. Recently, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters has moved back to its office, and newspapers have reported that the headquarters is guarded by police. This is bizarre and shocking. Members were specially sent to Longhua to investigate yesterday and confirmed that the police were guarding the headquarters and that no troops were stationed there. However, according to Chief of Staff Zhang of the Garrison Headquarters, as reported today, the headquarters has requested troops from the Ministry of Military Affairs and will be stationed in Southern Songjiang soon. We are delighted to hear this. However, the public security of Shanghai needs to be maintained urgently. Which troops will the government send to Shanghai, and when will they arrive? We sincerely hope that you will send a telegram in advance to dispel the doubts of the people. This association will inform the public and prepare to welcome them.</p>

<p>Japan Sends Miki Ryoei to Shanghai for Examination</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Far East News Agency) - General Shirakawa, commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Shanghai, who was injured in the Hongkou Park bombing on April 29, and Lieutenant General Ueda, commander of the 9th Division, who was also injured, were treated by doctors in the Army Garrison Hospital. Yesterday, General Shirakawa suddenly passed bloody stool. Doctors diagnosed that it was caused by a sudden illness in the internal organs. They were quite alarmed. When the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai heard about it, they were very worried and telegraphed back to Japan immediately. Therefore, the Ministry of the Army plans to send another doctor to Shanghai in the near future to treat Shirakawa's illness.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Dentsu News Agency) - The Ministry of the Army has sent Miki Ryoei, a medical doctor, first-class army medical officer, and chief of internal medicine at the Military Medical School, to Shanghai overnight to perform surgery on General Shirakawa. Miki is scheduled to depart from Tokyo Station tonight due to the sudden deterioration of General Shirakawa's condition.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Lodges a Strong Protest - At the Municipal Council meeting on the 18th of this month, the chairman reported that, according to the authority granted by the previous meeting, and because of certain incidents involving Japanese armed forces in the concession, which had been confirmed by the Chief of Police, he had sent a formal protest to the Consular Body, requesting the Consular Body to make efforts to persuade the Japanese naval and land forces not to interfere with or obstruct the activities of the Municipal Council's police and other personnel. As of this moment, the Consular Body has not replied. The content and wording of the letter have been severely criticized by the Japanese newspapers, but the Municipal Council's strong protest against the incident was unavoidable.</p>

<p>People's Organizations Joint Association Puts Forward Six Suggestions</p>
<h3 id="e21">Investigation of Confiscated Goods Committee Work <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The city's Pre-War of Resistance Confiscated Goods Investigation Committee is jointly organized by representatives from the Municipal Government, Public Security Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Party Headquarters, Local Court, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lawyers Association, Accountants Association, and the Pre-War of Resistance Association, etc. It has already held several meetings and has decided to start inventorying the Japanese goods sealed in various warehouses starting from the day before yesterday. It is said that the inventory procedures are very complicated and will take about a week to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Opinions of Public Organizations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the Federation of Public Organizations to the Confiscated Goods Clearance Committee states: (Title omitted) According to reports, your committee has taken over the anti-Japanese confiscated goods and started clearance. It is known that where great profit lies, evil abounds, especially in these recent times when people's hearts are not as they used to be and morality is declining. This is an unavoidable fact. The decline of all personality, reputation, and morality originates from this. Since the September 18th Incident, Shanghai has accumulated the achievements of the struggle of anti-Japanese members from all walks of life, resulting in the confiscation of various enemy goods, which demonstrates the spirit of our national history and deters those foreign powers who plot against us. However, due to the huge value and quantity of these goods, all kinds of treacherous merchants, corrupt officials, and local scoundrels have been coveting them for a long time, plotting to divide the spoils. Now that the humiliating agreement has been made and the government has declared great success, our people still maintain their consistent opposition. Anti-Japanese work absolutely cannot be stopped, and clearing the confiscated goods is premature, which is apparently the government's hidden intention to end the anti-Japanese movement, appease the enemy, and use the goods for private gain. This is done with lightning speed, secretly and unexpectedly, causing widespread concern. How can we not be outraged? Our association, representing all the people of Shanghai, respectfully submits the following opinions: (1) Regarding the organization, canceling the confiscation of goods has been reported by the Japanese media and recorded in the meeting minutes, which has also been repeatedly denied by diplomatic authorities. Now, it is being carried out in great haste. We are deeply concerned that it may be clearance in name but disposal in reality. Who will believe that it is not to fulfill the agreement and understanding? However, the officials of the authorities are skilled at covering things up. They call it clearance and invite representatives from various organizations to participate, but these so-called representatives are already eager to curry favor. Is this batch of confiscated goods to be monopolized by a few committee members? This is a question that all of Shanghai should pay attention to, and it is also a question that you should carefully consider. If it starts in the name of anti-Japanese resistance but ends with suspicions of making a fortune, what will the world say? Even filial sons and obedient grandsons will not be able to conceal it. If you must take the step of temporarily suspending the process, you should expand the organization and convene another meeting, taking the opinions of the majority of genuine anti-Japanese organizations in Shanghai as the standard. Otherwise, it will absolutely not be effective. (2) Continue the inspection of confiscated goods. This is the only way to genuinely resist for the long term. What the brutal Japanese deeply hate and detest is what our country is determined to uphold to the death. War can be stopped, but confiscation of goods cannot be stopped. If confiscation of goods stops, it will not only mean the loss of the country but also the loss of the race. It is still possible to carry out clearance today, but the clearance organization must be thorough and transparent, and the timing must be appropriate. It should only be carried out when absolutely necessary. While clearing the old goods, we should also inspect new goods. Only by doing both can we demonstrate the uprightness and integrity of our race. Moreover, only by thoroughly implementing the work of continued inspection can we wash away the shame of the collapse of the anti-Japanese confiscated goods solution. If your committee is ordered to carry out only clearance and from now on takes fundamental measures to eliminate the problem, then you will not be able to escape the title of traitor, and where will your dignity and integrity be? Rather than taking office, it is better to resign and let the authorities act recklessly and handle the matter directly. As for the distribution and use of the confiscated goods after clearance, it should be based on the principles of anti-Japanese resistance, as follows: (1) Promote domestic goods, (2) Provide relief to the unemployed, (3) Assist righteous troops, and (4) Comfort disaster victims. Any other measures that are seemingly for the public good but are ambiguous and not closely related to the principles of anti-Japanese resistance should be absolutely excluded. Recently, rumors have spread that a certain minister is coming to Shanghai to negotiate and allocate a certain amount of funds for a certain project. Although this is unfounded speculation, it is still chilling. As your committee has just taken office, and you are all known for your integrity, we hope that you will adopt the opinions of the public and provide the people of Shanghai with the opportunity to participate in public discussions in the shortest possible time, and at the same time clarify the future anti-Japanese and national salvation policy. With collective wisdom and efforts, we can continue to strive forward. Then your committee and your intentions can be clarified, and the future of the anti-Japanese resistance will be very fortunate. Our association feels a sense of crisis and dares not remain silent. In addition to notifying all the people of Shanghai and all the anti-Japanese and national salvation organizations, we hereby send this letter and hope that you will consider and respond. (Below omitted) Sincerely, The Shanghai Federation of Public Organizations.</p>

<p>Railway Police Gather at Upper South Station to Await Transfer</p>
<p>Due to the impending withdrawal of Japanese troops from the North Station, the Engineering Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau dispatched 60 laborers to the North Station and the area around Macgregor Road yesterday morning to repair the tracks. The railway property inside the station needs to be guarded by personnel urgently. Therefore, the Railway Bureau, with the approval of the Japanese military authorities, specially dispatched 12 railway police officers yesterday to protect the North Station and the railway property in various places to prevent theft. After the withdrawal of the Japanese troops, methods will be devised to resume traffic.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Traffic Department dispatched important officials to inspect the North Station and the area around Macgregor Road along the route.</p>
<p>After receiving news of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, Rong Yi, the chief of the two railway police sections, immediately began preparing for the defense of the two railways when traffic resumes. Since the Shanghai-Kunshan section was occupied by the Japanese and the lines were destroyed, the passes are not easily accessible. Without a strong police force, it would be difficult to discuss the matter. Therefore, a comprehensive plan was made to transfer well-trained senior police officers from the Hangzhou-Nanjing, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi police sections, either six or seven, or ten, all of whom are required to gather at the Upper South Station before the 20th to await transfer. The senior police officers have all complied with the order and gathered at Upper South Station, totaling more than 50 people. It is said that after the North Station is taken over, armed senior police officers will be stationed at each station from Shanghai to Suzhou for protection. Officers and police officers from the First and Second Nanjing sections will be responsible, and dozens of student police officers will be dispatched to assist. After traffic resumes, each passenger train will be assigned one investigator, leading one police chief and six police officers to travel back and forth for protection. The senior police officers accompanying the trains will be filled by the well-trained senior police officers transferred from each section, in order to ensure thoroughness and safety for travelers.</p>

<p>Claims He Will Not Go to Nanjing Until His Proposals Can Be Implemented</p>
<p>Says He Had No Prior Knowledge of the Opening of Japanese Goods Issue</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reports: Yesterday, due to news reports that Sun Ke had agreed to go to Nanjing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be convened in June, the reporter visited Mr. Sun at his residence on Molier Road at 10 a.m. Mr. Sun received the reporter in his study. The reporter asked: (1) Today's newspaper reported that you have agreed to go to Nanjing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be convened in June. Is this true? Sun replied: Recently, various Chinese and Western newspapers have reported news of my going to Nanjing almost every day. I don't know where these reports come from. My resignation last time was not accidental, and I have no personal grievances with the current central officials in charge. The difference lies in our views on domestic and foreign policies. The principles I published the other day are all practical proposals based on facts, not just empty slogans to cater to social psychology. The country's situation has become so dangerous. How can those with political responsibility engage in selfish power struggles? As for my going to Nanjing, I believe that as long as it benefits the country, I will not hesitate to brave danger. However, I will not go to Nanjing until my proposals can be implemented. (2) Did Chen Mingshu and Tan Zhen visit you in Shanghai the other day? Sun replied: Chen and Tan both visited me, but they only discussed the principles and content of the proposals and did not mention any other issues. (3) It is rumored that Chen Gongbo came to Shanghai this time with two missions: one is to represent the government and welcome you to Nanjing, and the other is to secretly carry out the opening of the confiscated enemy goods in Shanghai last year. According to the Beijing dispatch in the newspaper on the 19th, Chen reported to the Executive Yuan meeting the details of his talks with you in Shanghai. Can you tell us the details of your talks? Sun replied: I not only did not know his mission this time, but I have not even met him. The rumors that Chen came to Shanghai to see me and the details of our meeting are all untrue. (4) It is said that Chen was already opening up Japanese goods when you were the President of the Executive Yuan. Did you ever agree to it at that time? Sun replied: I absolutely had no prior knowledge of this matter. (5) It is said that this case has been discussed in the political conference several times, but it has not been passed due to opposition. If the government eventually sells Japanese goods, what will be your attitude? Sun replied: I think this matter is of great importance, and the government will not violate public opinion and implement it blindly. (6) What is the inside story of the reorganization of the Guangdong Air Force and Navy? Sun replied: I did not ask about this matter at first. Recently, I heard that Mr. Hu is mediating, and I think it will not be a problem. At this point, due to the arrival of other guests, the reporter excused himself and left.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Issues Important Statement <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Luoyang) Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, issued an important statement to our agency's reporter on the 19th regarding examination issues and Sino-Japanese issues, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e52">Regarding Examination Issues <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese nation is an excellent and intelligent nation in the world, with many talented people. It is a pity that the examination system has not yet been strictly implemented, resulting in the sigh of "lost treasures in the sea." The Examination Yuan should vigorously promote the examination system. Therefore, after the higher-level examinations last autumn, it was originally scheduled to hold general examinations this spring, but due to the need to deal with the national crisis, it was implicitly suspended. After the national crisis is resolved, the examination system should be strictly implemented to select true talents to create a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Regarding Sino-Japanese Issues <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Currently, although Japan has withdrawn its troops from Shanghai, it is increasing its troops in the three northeastern provinces. Its conspiracy must be to take advantage of the League of Nations Investigation Team's presence in China to seize Pingjin in order to make demands as a fallback. Therefore, the situation in Yuguan is urgent, and there is a sense of imminent danger. This Sino-Japanese agreement in Shanghai certainly does not have any secret clauses that betray our country. Guangdong has fully understood this, and the situation in Guangdong has returned to normal. Our country must be fully prepared for a long-term resistance to deal with the violent Japanese. At the same time, we also hope that the League of Nations will provide just assistance to restrain Japan. However, the Japanese militarists insist on a hard-line stance and are secretly borrowing money from France. If successful, they will make a stubborn attack on us. A second world war is likely to break out in the Pacific, and our country cannot but engage in a final resistance. Winning the war can strengthen the country, and losing the war can also strengthen the country. If Japan loses the war, it will certainly perish, and even if it wins, it will also perish. Because China's war against Japan will surely unite the patriotic power of the entire 400 million people and fight to the death. However, the true Yamato race in Japan is only three or four million. There are differences in opinions among domestic parties, and we have the majority while they have the minority. We have spirit, while they have material. Who will win and who will lose? Moreover, various imperialists cannot sit idly by. It is a pity that the "wooden clog boy" cannot see through this simple logic and is willing to walk the path of destruction, which is very pitiful. We hope that at this critical moment of life and death, the entire country will be of one mind and unite sincerely, eliminate internal strife forever, and resist foreign aggression together. Only then can we save the country from danger. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Japanese Political Situation Remains Chaotic <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Young Officers Strongly Oppose a Single-Party Cabinet</p>
<p>Seiyukai President Fails to Persuade Military</p>
<p>Saionji Tends to Favor the Military's Wishes</p>
<p>Hiranuma Cabinet Rumors Gain Traction</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that the political situation in Japan regarding the formation of a cabinet is deadlocked between the Seiyukai faction, led by the new president Suzuki, and the military, which advocates a national unity cabinet. Although the new Seiyukai president Suzuki dispatched Secretary-General Mori Kakuei to make great efforts to persuade Army Minister Araki and key figures in the military, the young officers in the military strongly opposed a single-party Seiyukai cabinet and had no effect. The military still insists that unless the ideal cabinet of the military is realized, no matter which faction rises to form a cabinet, there will be considerable methods to deal with it. Last night, Interior Minister Suzuki summoned Minister of Education Hatoyama and Secretary Mori to discuss the policy to cope with the situation. The result was still a decision to oppose a coalition or unified cabinet and to insist that a single-party Seiyukai cabinet was the only way forward. Therefore, the confrontation between the Seiyukai faction and the military has not only failed to ease slightly, but has worsened. As a result, the Genro Saionji, the protagonist in resolving the Japanese political situation, although he arrived in Tokyo at 5:00 PM yesterday, is unable to decide to enter the palace and make a request due to the extreme and uncompromising state of the two factions. Saionji is quite anxious about the deterioration of the situation. At 9:00 AM today, he summoned acting Prime Minister Takahashi, at 10:00 AM Privy Council President Kuratomi, and at 11:00 AM Army Minister Araki to his residence in Surugadai to listen to their opinions in an urgent attempt to find a way to enter the palace and request the Emperor to order the formation of a cabinet. However, according to the current situation, Saionji's entry into the palace to make a request may be difficult to achieve in the next day or two, and the trend of the Japanese political situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that Seiyukai President Suzuki invited Education Minister Hatoyama and Secretary-General Mori to the Interior Minister's official residence at 7:30 PM last night to discuss how to cope with the situation. At the meeting, it was believed that the military's demands on the successor cabinet could be divided into two factions. One faction argued that even a single-party cabinet was acceptable if it could implement the policies demanded by the military. The other faction absolutely opposed a single-party cabinet on principle. Since the military's own opinions were not consistent, it was decided to wait and see. This was the unanimous opinion. However, President Suzuki and Education Minister Hatoyama believed that organizing a single cabinet and implementing the military's demands was sufficient. Secretary Mori believed that it would be impossible to resolve the situation unless a national unity cabinet was organized, and it would be difficult to hope for the Emperor's command without the intention of organizing a national unity cabinet. Finally, President Suzuki stated that if Saionji requested him to form a cabinet on the condition of organizing a national unity cabinet or a cooperative cabinet, he would firmly decline.</p>

<p>Repudiates Pan-Nationalist Movement</p>
<p>Suzuki Formally Takes Office as President</p>
<p>Domei reported from Tokyo on the 20th that at today's temporary meeting of the Seiyukai, Secretary-General Yamaguchi strongly advocated that in order to establish constitutional politics, party politics must be upheld. Party elder Sugawara Den also strongly advocated, saying that President Inukai fought for constitutionalism until he was assassinated, and the will of the former president should be inherited to fight to the death against the fascist movement with an absolute majority of 300 members, and that the entire party should unite and strive for constitutional politics and uphold the new president.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that the Seiyukai held a party conference at its headquarters at 2:00 PM today and formally endorsed Interior Minister Suzuki as the next president. Next, the new President Suzuki gave a speech of thanks and took office, and the conference adjourned.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 20th that Suzuki's speech vigorously promoted the two major policies of consolidating national defense and improving existing diplomatic methods. Suzuki not only spoke of the need for national awareness, but also said that it was urgent to find ways to relieve the current economic distress, especially to focus on rural areas. Suzuki advocated clarifying politics and guiding the thoughts of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Military's Attitude Hardens <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Firmly Insists on Organizing a National Cabinet</p>
<p>Domei reported from Tokyo on the 20th that at this morning's meeting of the three chiefs of the Japanese Army, there was absolute opposition to a party cabinet, and all opinions were firmly excluded in order to realize a national unity cabinet. The military believes that after the completion of political purification by a national unity cabinet, the path of constitutionalism should be restored to normalcy. Therefore, at a time when the nation is facing survival, it does not care even if the world criticizes the military for interfering in politics.</p>
<p>Domei reported from Tokyo on the 20th that the opinion of the highest-ranking officers of the Army was originally to temporarily realize the Suzuki cabinet based on policy and then make further plans. As of last night, after the compromise theory between Suzuki and Araki was reported, the atmosphere in the department suddenly hardened, and it did not recognize the politics of political parties. Even with the prestige of Army Minister Araki and Vice Minister Masaki, if they were forcibly suppressed, there was a risk of an unforeseen incident. Therefore, the Army Minister and Vice Minister had no choice but to follow the general trend. Suzuki, Hatoyama, Mori, and others, seeing this situation, specially gathered last night to secretly discuss countermeasures and did not disperse until late at night. Judging from the current situation, unless Suzuki abandons his position as President of the Seiyukai and returns to the position of a patriot, he may not be able to wear the seal of the successor Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 20th that Army Training Inspector-General Takenouchi Nobuyoshi, accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Masaki, visited Army Minister Araki this morning and informed him of the Japanese Army's lack of preparation to support a purely party cabinet. Because the Army deeply believes that only a transcendental cabinet is sufficient to maintain the people's hearts, for the sake of supporting the country and safely navigating the current crisis, it is necessary to organize a non-partisan national government. Someone indicated that the Emperor may summon Hiranuma Shinsuke, the leader of the Kokuhonsha, tomorrow and order him to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>Domei reported from Tokyo on the 20th that junior officers of the Army and other like-minded people presented 13 articles of opinion to Army Minister Araki today, one of which stated, "A formed political party cannot be the basis for a new cabinet," which has already shown the attitude of the middle-ranking cadres of the Army towards the current situation.</p>

<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that although Saionji has entered Kyoto, the political situation is still centered on the military's hard-line theory and has fallen into a chaotic situation. As to who should be recommended in response to the Emperor's inquiry, it is necessary to inquire about the opinions of all parties, observe the trend quietly, and make a decision after careful consideration. Therefore, the Genro's entry into the palace to make a request will be in the next day or two.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that after interim Prime Minister Takahashi visited Saionji this morning, he attended a cabinet meeting. Even when Interior Minister Suzuki questioned him about the content of his meeting with Lord Saionji, he did not say a word, which shows that Lord Saionji's mood has been considerably influenced by the claims of the military.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that Lord Saionji will meet separately with Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro tomorrow morning, and Count Kiyoura Keigo in the afternoon, and will decide to listen to the opinions of senior officials on how to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that due to the hard-line attitude of the military and the passive and moderate attitude of the Seiyukai, the succeeding cabinet could not overcome this difficulty without a national unity cabinet. However, the veteran senior officials who bear the heavy responsibility of requesting the succeeding cabinet are most concerned about the problem of the first cabinet. Will they request Seiyukai President Suzuki to organize a coalition cabinet with the Seiyukai as the main force, or will they request Hiranuma, the vice president of the Privy Council, or other influential figures? On this point, there is much to be considered. If someone other than President Suzuki is requested to be Prime Minister, their strength, skill, personality, credibility, and prestige must be sufficient to control both the political and civilian parties, and at the same time, in this important situation, they must be able to obtain the unanimous support of the people. The veteran senior officials are concerned about this. Will they seek someone outside the political parties, or will they adopt a more accommodating approach and request President Suzuki? The attention of the political world, the financial world, and the entire nation is focused on this point.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that after Duke Saionji arrived in Tokyo station yesterday, various dignitaries rushed to visit him, advocating either a party cabinet or a transcendental cabinet, and did their best to lobby. It is faintly heard that after Duke Saionji met with political dignitaries and inquired in detail about the political situation, he also did not advocate organizing a national government to replace the party cabinet.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 20th telegram: Yesterday, when Duke Saionji arrived at Tokyo Station by train, someone distributed 700 leaflets with quite radical language, saying that the public opinion of 80 million people should be given more weight than the opinion of one Genro.</p>

<p>Domei News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that the possibility of Hiranuma Kiichirou becoming the next Prime Minister has increased sharply.

<p>Organization Formed After Toranomon Incident</p>
<p>China United News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 20th that the Kokuhonsha was an organization created by Kōzō Ōta, a student at Tokyo Imperial University, at the end of 1919 to oppose the democracy movement of Dr. Yoshino. In 1924, when the Emperor was to pass through Toranomon by car for the opening ceremony of the Diet, he was assassinated. The Yamamoto Cabinet resigned because of this. After Justice Minister Hiranuma resigned from his position, he changed his policy and reorganized the Kokuhonsha into a thought group, starting a movement for national essence throughout the country, expanding its organization. Currently, Navy Minister Ōsumi and Army Minister Araki are its powerful leaders. Its power has infiltrated the military and the Ministry of Justice. Many other officials and financial leaders are maintainers of the association. Currently, the Kokuhonsha includes Sumitomo Bank General Manager Ikeda Seihin, former Justice Minister Hara Yoshimichi, former Ambassador Honda Kumataro, Upper House Member Viscount Ogasawara Nagasei, former Chief of Naval General Staff Katō Kanji, Vice Chief of Staff Masaki, Vice Minister of the Army Koiso, and Kantō Governor-General Yamaoka, among others. This shows its full composition. It utilizes the power of the Nichiren sect to promote feudal morality and is now the basic group of the Fascist Party in Japan's military and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Death of Far Eastern Army Commander</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 20th - TASS has received an official announcement that firmly denies certain recent sensational reports from newspapers and news agencies, which mislead the public and diminish the value of the Soviet Union's commitment to a policy of peace. One report, disseminated by the German overseas news agency, concerned an address to the entire nation by the Red Army General Staff after the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai. According to the overseas news agency, this address was broadcast wirelessly throughout the Soviet Union. The Chief of the Red Army General Staff allegedly stated that in the coming weeks, it would be determined whether Japanese diplomats or Japanese military personnel would decide the policy towards Manchuria, and concluded by urging the Red Army to intensify preparations. The Soviet Union officially states that neither the Chief of the Red Army General Staff nor any other Soviet personnel made such an address. This report is clearly fabricated by the overseas agency and can only be viewed as an anti-Soviet fabrication. Another report, published yesterday in the New York Times and circulated by overseas news agencies, claimed that the Moscow Supreme Military Council had decided to call up reservists born in 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912 for this year's grand maneuvers, to join the city security forces, or to join the Red Guards, with no exceptions allowed. The official statement indicates that the Supreme Military Council has made no such decision. The report from the overseas agency is groundless and can only be regarded as an anti-Soviet fabrication.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 20th - Voskretsov, commander of the Far Eastern Red Army of the Soviet Union, who repeatedly defeated the White Russian forces during the civil war and foreign intervention, has passed away here. During the war, Voskretsov captured the city of Spassk, defeated the White Russian forces led by Dachlish, defeated the White Russian forces of Panbilev in Ogzhaksk, and captured Pan alive. For these achievements, Voskretsov received four Orders of the Red Banner.</p>

<p>Greatly Praises the League of Nations</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 19th - Mr. Peak, who was the Secretary of War during the presidency of U.S. President Wilson and is a key figure in political circles with the possibility of being nominated as a Democratic presidential candidate, stated today in response to inquiries about his political views that Japan will eventually implement its grand plan for China. This matter will present a severe test for politicians worldwide. He has always been an enthusiastic supporter of the League of Nations and believes that the United States misunderstands the League. The League of Nations has methods and effectiveness. Americans desire swift action and therefore often criticize the League for its slow action. In reality, the League's handling of the Far Eastern situation is hampered by the United States' non-participation. He believes that without the League of Nations, an organization for world peace, Japan would have been able to do as it pleased in Asia long ago. As a result, the entire culture of the Far East would be in the midst of transformation. If that were the case, the whole world would be affected.</p>

<p>Majority of Opinions Concerned About Dangerous Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>Independent Political and Diplomatic Newspaper Says Japan is Gradually Awakening</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 19th - The German Political and Diplomatic News, which often expresses the opinions of German official circles regarding foreign politics, published an article today that differs from most German newspapers, taking a hopeful tone in an attempt to alleviate public anxieties about the situation in the Far East. It believes that the shock within Japan over the assassination incident has somewhat subsided, and a more sober attitude is gradually emerging. Military leaders such as Araki do not support radical elements, so it is highly hoped that Japan will reject adventurous plans for its own benefit. Finally, it stated that although the situation is still fraught with ominous signs, we must remain calm and refrain from excessive pronouncements. However, most newspapers holding the opposite view, such as local newspapers aligned with the conservative faction, analyze the situation, stating that the organization of the new Japanese cabinet will greatly impact the trend of events in the Far East. What kind of developments will occur in the future is difficult to predict at this time, but there is no doubt that military factions in the new government will be able to freely implement their policies in Manchuria and Mongolia. Currently, as Soviet Russia increases its troops on the Far Eastern border and Japanese military personnel are able to do as they please, there is a fear that there will be more disputes between the two countries. Many other newspapers hold similar views.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - It was learned today that police have discovered plans for further uprisings by members of three Japanese terrorist groups and are planning large-scale raids. Although these three groups appear to be unrelated on the surface, they are actually cooperating with each other. One is the Blood Pledge Corps, which assassinated Inoue and Dan Takuma; another is the Young Officers' Corps, which assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on Sunday; and the third is the Peasant Suicide Squad, which bombed a power plant on May 16th. The membership of the three groups is approximately as follows: Blood Pledge Corps, 300 members; Young Officers' Corps, 120 members; Peasant Suicide Squad, 300 members.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 19th - The Soviet Russian representative today proposed a new standard for arms reduction, requesting that each country's military strength be determined according to the following five points: (1) the length of coastline and land borders; (2) the size of the national territory and the density of the population; (3) the railway system; (4) military alliances and international political relations; (5) the degree of security enjoyed since the armistice of the European War. It strongly advocated that the fifth item should take into account whether the country has been subjected to foreign military invasion since the European War, or whether there have been other attempts to encroach upon its territory, before determining the extent of its military strength. In addition, the Russian representative also suggested strict restrictions on private capital invested in the manufacture of military equipment, and that the capital of all arsenals should be published on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Trotsky Publishes an Article</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 19th - Trotsky, a key figure in the Russian Communist Party who is in exile abroad, recently published an article in an American newspaper, believing that if the National Socialist Party's Hitler gains national power, its impact will ultimately strengthen France's hegemony in Europe. Berlin newspapers this morning quoted and commented on this article. Trotsky claimed that if Hitler seizes power, Germany will be used by the French to form an anti-Russian crusade. If I were still in charge of Russian politics, I would immediately order the mobilization of the national army upon receiving the phone call that Hitler had seized power in Berlin, without any hesitation. However, it is expected that Stalin may not be able to act as quickly as he would. But even if Stalin stands still, a Soviet Russia and a Hitlerized Germany will inevitably face war. War will break out soon after Hitler seizes power, because the German proletariat, and even the Socialist Party and socialist trade unions, will be forced to request Soviet Russian assistance to resist the terror of stick-wielding. Today, the Poznan Post commented on this matter, claiming that it is a great fortune for Soviet Russia, Germany, and the world that Trotsky has no opportunity to seize Russian political power. Although Stalin is harsh in dealing with internal affairs, he is always extremely cautious in diplomacy. Although Stalin, like Lenin and Trotsky, is a believer in ideology, he is also a pragmatist. Trotsky is often a prisoner of ideology, only knowing ideals.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e111">Japanese Deeply Fear <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Sovietization of Japan</p>
<p>Fear of Taking the Opportunity to Disrupt the Pacific War with the United States</p>
<p>Transforming Yamato Japan into Soviet Japan</p>
<p>Therefore, They Want to Compromise with Soviet Russia Before the War</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun published an essay by Hirokichi Otake on the 13th, detailing the relationship between Soviet Russia and Japan, advocating for the easing of Soviet Russia's anti-Japanese sentiment, and discussing the attitude that Russia would take if war were to break out between Japan and the United States. This is extremely important, given the rapidly changing situation in the Far East. The attitudes of the United States and Russia toward Japan, and the strategies that Japan should adopt toward the United States and Russia, are matters of concern to those who are interested in the current situation. Therefore, we have translated it in order to prepare for future major changes. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is gradually shifting from tension to relaxation, judging from the recent atmosphere. The idea of a war between our Japan and the Soviet Union has not yet reached the stage of liquidation, so we should make every effort to avoid conflict between the two countries. Even if the Soviet Union challenges us, we are willing to retreat. Since Tanaka inspected Manchuria and returned home to express his views, the government has also tended to soften its stance toward Russia. Since the Manchurian Incident, although various difficulties have arisen in the future construction projects of Japan in Manchuria, the Soviet government, in the midst of the first five-year plan that has just been successfully completed, still has countless obstacles to domestic construction that have not yet been started to clear. Therefore, during this period, if a conflict occurs with Japan, its harmfulness and uselessness are also well known to the world. Moreover, after a conflict between Japan and Russia, it will inevitably involve the whole world and be involved in the vortex of war. The governments of the two countries, Japan and Russia, which bear such a major responsibility, dare not proceed rashly and take such a great risk. Since there is such a significant danger in fact, it can be clearly understood that conflicts will not occur from the current positions of the two countries.</p>
<p>However, where is the reason why the relations between the two countries cannot be stabilized today? The various problems that have arisen since the Manchurian Incident are often suspected by both sides. If we want to clear up this suspicion, there is no concrete or major strategy other than stabilizing the relations between Japan and Russia. The first way to stabilize Japan and Russia is to first establish coordination between Japan and Russia.</p>
<p>When the Manchurian Incident broke out last September, I happened to be traveling in the Soviet Union. The attitude of the government and the general society of that country towards the incident was speculated by foreigners residing in the Soviet Union at that time, and it was said that there was a secret agreement between Japan and Russia. However, the Japanese government and the public at that time thought that the obstruction to the actions in Manchuria was actually Soviet Russia. Afterwards, as the incident gradually shifted, the attitude of Soviet Russia became more cautious, and our people also did not examine the attitude of Soviet Russia, which led to the concentration of the Red Army on the Far Eastern border. At that time, the Japanese government and the public suddenly heard that the Red Army was moving east, which was almost like a bolt from the blue. Because in the era when the military preparations in the Far East were weak, the Soviet Russia, which outwardly pretended to be peaceful and strictly neutral, suddenly changed to a positive attitude today, which caused unrest among the people. This is the source of Japan's suspicion of Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Although, it is not unreasonable for Soviet Russia to increase troops in the Far East. They believe that White Russian people are receiving open or secret assistance from Japan, attempting to disrupt the Far East. Therefore, Soviet Russia has to be prepared. Among them, Soviet Russia feels even more uneasy about Japan, that is, when Ambassador Aizawa was en route to Moscow in the past, the Russian government expressed the issue of a non-aggression treaty, and Ambassador Drolenov also proposed the intention of that issue. However, at that time, Japan thought that there was no need to conclude it. Therefore, Soviet Russia suspected that Japan had other ambitions. We believe that if there is no other intention in the Far East, we should urgently dispel Russia's misunderstanding. Secondly, Japan has declared its respect for the interests of Soviet Russia in the Middle East Railway. At present, White Russian people who are employed by Manchuria along the Middle East Railway, such as police officers and other positions, are quite active. Cases of intimidation of Soviet Russian people among railway employees are often heard. This time, the White Russian bombing of a military train suddenly deteriorated the relationship between Soviet Russia and Japan. This kind of instigation behavior of the White Russian people (the journalist notes that the Japanese side once pointed out that the explosion of the Middle East Railway military train was caused by Red Russia, but now suddenly says that it was instigated by White Russia, which is very strange) almost led to a conflict between Japan and Russia.</p>
<p>At that time, Soviet Russia prepared to negotiate with Japan on this issue and the general issue of the Middle East Railway, thinking that Japan's actions, which did not clearly indicate formal procedures, gained Russia's permission, and went its own way, which was difficult to tolerate. Therefore, Russia's suspicion of Japan is very strong. Fortunately, the people in charge of both countries recently worked hard to avoid conflict, and the situation has gradually eased. At this time, Japan and Soviet Russia should sincerely discuss the Manchuria issue to make Soviet Russia's doubts about Japan disappear.</p>
<p>However, when we silently observe the internal situation in Russia, there is indeed a very frightening point, that is, if Japan goes to war with the United States in the Pacific, Soviet Russia will definitely take advantage of the opportunity from behind to try to destroy Japan, plan to disrupt the domestic situation in Japan, and make the whole country fall into the red situation. Soviet Russia uses the good opportunity of the Japanese-American war, hoping that when Japan is defeated, it can take advantage of the confusion of the Japanese people's hearts to vigorously promote the redification of Japan in order to achieve the goal of world revolution. Therefore, some people advocate that before the Japanese-American war breaks out, we should first attack Soviet Russia to eliminate future troubles.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese-American war, from the observation of Russian politicians, it is a conflict between imperialism and imperialism. If Russia actively assists one side and makes another country win, it also violates the spirit of the founding of the Soviet Russia. However, Soviet Russia takes advantage of the opportunity of the Japanese-American war, rushes behind Japan, and transforms "Yamato Japan" into "Soviet Japan", which is difficult for us to guarantee that it will not do so. At that time, the situation in Japan, the enemy behind it, will increase the threat and hatred a hundredfold compared to the enemy in front. How will the national sentiment of the Japanese people be affected? It is also unknown. I am afraid that the Japanese government will have to negotiate peace with the enemy in front before a thorough defeat. At this time, the capitalist homeland of America, seeing that Japan has become Sovietized, will change its plan, unite with the anti-Soviet Western European countries, and stand on the same battle line to fight to the death with the Soviet Union. Therefore, this policy of Soviet Russia is also very risky.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Anhui Bandits Capture Huoqiu <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Su Jiabu in Liu'an Also Falls</p>
<p>Huo and Shou Counties Request Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Correspondent in Bengbu: Anhui bandits attacked and captured Zhengyang. Huoqiu was the first to receive a serious threat. After the bandits withdrew from Zhengyang, Huoqiu was reported to have fallen, indicating the rampant momentum of the bandits. Huoqiu is west of Zhengyang, south of Yingshang, bordering Liu'an to the south, and adjacent to Gushi on the Henan border to the west. The four southwestern townships have long been occupied by bandits. The 40th Brigade of Song Shike's division has been stationed in Huoqiu for more than a year. Due to effective maintenance in the past, there have been no accidents. When Zhengyang fell, the Cheng and Wang regiments of that brigade advanced from Huoqiu towards Zhengyang. Unexpectedly, the bandits took advantage of the emptiness in the city, gathered a large force to attack, and captured it on the 15th. Song's brigade immediately gathered around Yuezhangji to counterattack at the right time. After the fall of Huoqiu, the Huoqiu fellow villagers' association here received a telegram from Huoqiu local figures from Yingshang, pleading with the military authorities in Bengbu to request that a large army be dispatched quickly to suppress the bandits in order to save the survivors. After receiving the telegram, the association telegraphed the central government and Chen Tiaoyuan, requesting that troops be sent quickly to suppress the bandits. The area around Yingshang, Liu'an, Fengtai, and Shou County is now extremely tense. Su Jiabu in Liu'an, which had been besieged by bandits for many days, also fell due to lack of reinforcements a few days ago. Liu'an has been surrounded and is in urgent need of assistance. The 7th Aviation Squadron stationed in Bengbu has been dispatching aircraft to deliver supplies for days. Shou County, because no reinforcements have arrived for a long time, local militias and county police have jointly organized a city defense team. The people of Shou County in Bengbu have specially organized the Shou County Refugee Appeal Association. The association was informed that the Fourth Division had dispatched two brigades, but the division commander, Xu Tingyao, had not arrived, and the troops were unable to depart. Today (18th), representatives Yu Yumen, Lu Chewu, Sun Qiqian, etc., were specially dispatched to Beijing to appeal, urging Xu to come quickly and lead the troops to suppress the bandits, and appealed to the central government to send more troops to severely suppress the Red bandits in northern Anhui to save the people's lives and secure the locality.

<p>Correspondent in Changsha: After the failure of the 5th Army of the 3rd Army Corps of the Red bandits, Peng Dehuai, and the 7th Army of Li Mingrui (after Li's death, the troops were commanded by Peng concurrently), they fled to the Shangyou and Chongyi areas. In late April, because He Jian sent Hou Pengfei's brigade stationed in Chenzhou to resolve the old troops of Gong Hao stationed in Yizhang, Hunan, and chased into Guiyang and Jiahe in Hunan, the defense of Chenzhou was empty. Peng Dehuai took the opportunity to enter Hunan and occupied Rucheng on May 2nd, and occupied Guidong on the 8th, with a great intention to invade southern Hunan. He Jian immediately telegraphed Wang Dongyuan, commander of the 15th Division, to reorganize the old troops of Gong Hao into the training regiment of the 15th Division to resolve the issue. He immediately transferred Hou Pengfei's brigade back to Chenzhou to block Peng's bandits, and convened a military conference in Changsha on the 11th to discuss the suppression plan. He Jian, Liu Jianxu, Li Jue, Peng Weiren, etc. were all present and agreed on the following matters: (1) Wang Dongyuan's division, Hou Pengfei and Zhang Guzhong's two brigades, and the local defense forces of Chenzhou, Rucheng, and Guiyang will advance from Chenzhou to suppress Rucheng, with Wang Dongyuan as the commander of the front line; (2) Chen Guangzhong's division, Zhao Mengyan's brigade, and the teams of Anling and other counties will advance from Ling County towards Guidong, with Chen Guangzhong as the commander of the front line; (3) The aviation department was ordered to send Yan Yaopu of the First Aviation Squadron to lead three aircraft to Hengzhou, and to fly to Rucheng and Guiyang every day for reconnaissance and bombing; (4) Wang Dongyuan's division, Wang Zhibin's brigade, and the teams of the four counties of Hengyang, Hengshan, Changning, and Leiyang will be the general reserve team, concentrated in Leiyang and Yongxing, and will reinforce Rucheng and Guiyang at any time; (5) All the above-mentioned troops are limited to completing the concentration by the evening of the 12th, and a general offensive will be launched towards Rucheng and Guiyang at dawn on the 13th; (6) He Jian and Liu Jianxu will depart from the province to Heng and Chen on the 13th to supervise the suppression; (7) The above-mentioned suppression plan will be telegraphed to Jiangxi He (Yingqin) and Guangdong Chen (Jitang) to request their dispatch of troops to encircle and suppress the bandits in order to achieve encirclement. After the above mobilization order was issued, Wang Dongyuan took a car from Hengzhou to Chenzhou on the 12th. On the 13th, he supervised Hou and Zhang's two brigades to attack Rucheng. The Peng bandits in Rucheng, known as the Second and Third Divisions, with about 3,000 people, only made contact for about two hours in Maqiao, 30 miles away from Rucheng, and then abandoned Rucheng and fled to the Reshuiwei and Wenying areas. Hou's brigade recovered Rucheng at 1 p.m. on the 13th. Because the Reshuiwei and Wenying areas are adjacent to Jiangxi, it is necessary to wait for the arrival of the Guangdong and Jiangxi armies before they can be jointly suppressed. Therefore, Hou and Zhang's two brigades are temporarily stationed in Rucheng awaiting orders. As for Zhao Mengyan's brigade, which attacked Guidong, because the journey from Ling County to Guidong is full of high mountains and inconvenient transportation, it did not arrive near Guidong until the 15th. The Red bandits in Guidong had one division of Peng Dehuai and two regiments of Li Mingrui. They came into contact on the 16th, and because of their strong resistance, the two sides were still deadlocked until the 18th. He Jian took a car from the province to Hengzhou on the morning of the 13th, and then went to Leiyang on the morning of the 14th. He arrived at 11 a.m., convened the general reserve team for training, and then went to Chenzhou from Leiyang at 12 o'clock to inspect. On the 15th, he returned to Leiyang from Chenzhou to arrange everything. On the 16th, he returned to Hengzhou from Leiyang and negotiated with the army commander Liu Jianxu: (1) All matters concerning the suppression of bandits in southern Hunan in the future will be handed over to Liu Jianxu. All the troops, teams, and aircraft currently in southern Hunan will be under Liu's command and dispatch. He Jian returned to the province that day; (2) Order the general reserve team in Leiyang and Yongxing to rush to Guidong to assist in the attack, and strive to recover Guidong County within three days; (3) After the recovery of Guidong, the various army groups will stop in Rucheng and Guidong to await orders, and will wait for the Guangdong and Jiangxi armies to establish contact with the Hunan army before carrying out a joint encirclement and suppression.</p>
<p>As for the troops sent by Guangdong and Jiangxi to join the suppression, the provincial government received telegrams from He Yingqin and Chen Jitang yesterday, stating that Jiangxi Province sent two divisions of Chen Cheng's department, Li Ming and Liu Shaoxian, and Guangdong Province sent three brigades of Chen Zhang, Chen Hanguang, and Fan Dexing, all advancing towards Rucheng and Guiyang on the Hunan border to suppress the bandits. The three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi now have five divisions with five military forces, which will launch a large-scale encirclement of the bandits. (May 18th)</p>

<p>The seawall along the county's coast is in a precarious state and urgently needs repair. The county chamber of commerce has telegraphed the seawall committee to appeal. Now, it continues to telegraph its petition, saying: "Jiangnan Seawall Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, greetings. The resolution of the seawall conference to convene this session to determine the order of projects will be truly beneficial to the coastal people. However, the Songjiang seawall is divided into first, second, third, and fourth sections, and must be repaired as a whole to achieve solidity. The first and second sections were originally earthen seawalls, and danger occurred here last year, with a breach of a hundred feet, shocking far and wide. If there is a storm this autumn, the earthen seawall will be washed away first, and the third and fourth sections, no matter how strong, will have no guarantee. We sincerely request that the four sections of the Songjiang seawall be surveyed and repaired together at the same time. In addition to the lack of funds, there are very large old straight stones that should be moved to the most important places to defend. The association has more immediate knowledge and is deeply fearful. We respectfully plead for the lives of hundreds of thousands of compatriots along the coast. We look forward to the implementation with the utmost anticipation."</p>

<p>Suicide by Poisoning Due to Economic Pressure On the evening of the 16th, at about 9 p.m., a traveler, Wang Baoshan, who was staying at the Zhaoshang Hotel on Dongda Street, room 32, was asleep. He did not get up until 11 a.m. on the 17th. Zhou Baoyuan, the tea house attendant, knocked on the door but received no response. Then he heard a groan from the next room and quickly knocked on the door. Only then did he know that he had taken poison. A suicide note was left on the table, stating that he had committed suicide because he was under economic pressure and his aunt and uncle Zhou Zixiang in Zhoujiawan suspected him of stealing gold jewelry in order to clear his name. Afterwards, he was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for gastric lavage by the hotel, but it was ineffective and he died soon after. In the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau reported to the county for examination and summoned Zhou Zixiang for questioning before ordering him to collect the body.</p>

<p>The Reason for Xu Difan's Suicide. Xu Difan, a female doctor at the Deji Hospital, was originally from Wuxi. Her parents and two younger sisters lived at home. Five years ago, she was introduced to work at the Deji Hospital. Because of her plain appearance, Xu had told people that she intended to remain single. Although she was thirty years old, she was not yet married. She was quite dedicated to her work, and her obstetrical surgeries were considered the best in Pingyi. Over the years, she had gained the praise of local people, and her business flourished as a result. The hospital owner, Wang Yu Jiu, was delighted to have her as an assistant and treated her generously. Xu, feeling adrift in the world, was usually pessimistic. Since meeting Wang and spending time together, an unspoken relationship developed between them. Recently, Wang's wife found out about it and, consumed by jealousy, took the opportunity to humiliate and scold her. Xu couldn't help but feel sorry for herself and cried loudly in her room all night. Although Wang's wife apologized and Wang comforted her, she was already determined to die and could not be dissuaded. That night, she ran out the window, intending to take a boat to Shanghai. Wang noticed and quickly chased her to the pier and persuaded her to return. The next day, Xu, taking advantage of people's inattention, secretly went to Shanghai. She sent two registered letters from the Lao Huizhong Hotel on Lishan East Road, one to Wang Yu Jiu and one to a colleague named Xu. Wang, upon reading the letter, knew that he had caused a disaster. He hastily sent his wife to Jiaxing to take a car to Shanghai, while he himself took a boat from Pinghu to Shanghai, hoping to prevent any mishaps. However, it was too late, and news of her death arrived. The people of Pingyi are all lamenting her death.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Postal Workers' Union Telegrams the Ministry of Communications <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Thorough Investigation of Bribery and Strike</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fundraising columns of various newspapers published news that the Ministry of Communications had received a secret report that someone had offered 30,000 yuan to instigate a strike by Shanghai postal workers. The content was quite bizarre. Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers visited Zhao, a committee member of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, to ask for his opinion on the matter and to inquire about the union's plan to strengthen the postal service and the recent progress. Zhao gave a comprehensive response. Reporter (Q): The Ministry of Communications telegraphed back to the General Post Office that the proposed merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau should not be allowed after being decided by the Central Political Council. However, there were some substantial responses regarding other issues. How will your members respond to this? (A): The proposals submitted by our two unions and postal workers' unions across the country are divided into three main categories: maintaining the principle of self-sufficiency of the postal service, merging the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and stopping subsidies for airline expenses. Among them, the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is the most important issue that employees across the country have been fighting for a long time and is the main purpose of this movement. However, the Ministry of Communications has determined that the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau should not be allowed, and there is no indication of agreement regarding the other two categories. What they have agreed to is only the restoration of the existing compensation system for our postal workers. In short, the Ministry of Communications' telegram shows no sincerity in accepting our union's plan to strengthen the postal service. Our two unions will continue to work hard and persevere. (Q): It is reported that Mayor Wu of Shanghai invited eight members of your union, including Shi Yitang and Zhao Shusheng, to a meeting at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and expressed enthusiastic support for your plan, promising to pass it on to the central government for implementation. I wonder if this will achieve its purpose? (A): Our union has received reports from members Zhao Shusheng and Shi Yitang about this matter. We are very grateful for Mayor Wu's sympathy and kindness. With Mayor Wu's sympathy and leadership, we will surely benefit even more in practice. However, our union's approach is to respect the will of all employees, and we will not delay our efforts because of this. (Q): Regarding the news report that the Ministry of Communications received a secret report that someone offered 30,000 yuan to instigate a strike by Shanghai postal workers and has ordered the strike to be stopped and the ringleaders to be arrested, this news is quite bizarre. How will your union respond to this? (A): According to the news report, our union has telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to investigate the source of the secret report. As those responsible for the postal workers' union, our determination is very firm. We cannot be subdued by force or moved by self-interest. The so-called "movement of tens of thousands of yuan" may be a fabrication of charges by a group of political rascals attempting to undermine the postal service. However, our union firmly believes that the Ministry of Communications' decision must have a source. We hope that the truth will be clarified as soon as possible. If the Ministry of Communications confirms that this is indeed the case, then any member of our union is willing to go to Beijing and surrender themselves without waiting for the Ministry of Communications to arrest them. Otherwise, the person who made the secret report should be prosecuted to clarify their legal responsibility, etc. The committee member then showed the reporter the telegram sent to the Ministry of Communications, which is recorded below. To the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing: We have read today's Shanghai newspaper report that the Ministry of Communications received a secret report that someone offered 30,000 yuan to instigate a strike by Shanghai postal workers and that the Executive Yuan was requested to immediately telegraph the Shanghai Party, government, and military authorities to strictly stop it and arrest the ringleaders. We are extremely indignant. Our two unions have proposed a plan to strengthen the postal service as a long-term solution to protect the postal service. Our intentions are pure and can be testified to by Heaven and Earth. We urge you to investigate the source of the secret report. If it is indeed the case, our two unions are willing to lead more than 30,000 employees across the country to the capital to accept the most severe punishment. If it is false, please investigate and prosecute the person who made the secret report to clarify their legal responsibility and to dispel public doubts. Sincerely, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Postal Employees' Union.</p>

<p>Provoke Widespread Opposition</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association Issues an Urgent Notice</p>
<p>The Shanghai British Waterworks Company of the Public Concession has implemented a new contract signed with the Municipal Council in 1931, adopting a water meter system. This has provoked widespread opposition, and the situation is quite serious. However, the water company has notified users in Zone 2 to sign the new contract by the end of May or face suspension of water supply. The Real Estate Association issued an urgent notice yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Original Text of the Contract <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council and the Shanghai British Waterworks Company entered into a new contract on December 24, 1931, as follows: (1) The Company may, in all bills issued in January 1932 and subsequent months, charge for water supplied for municipal purposes and to users referred to in the contract at the rates specified in the attached table, in place of the current rates. The various prices listed in Article 2 of the contract dated February 18, 1930, are equal to the price of water supplied by standby pipes as stipulated in Clause 4 of Schedule C attached hereto. This water price also includes the aforementioned increased water price. (2) All price schedules include all incidental matters and may be amended at any time if both parties agree that there is a legitimate reason for amendment. Whenever the silver exchange rate rises to two shillings, the Municipal Council may reassess the aforementioned increased water price. (3) The Company shall immediately proceed to adopt a common water meter system throughout the entire area of water supply and shall therefore divide the supply area into appropriate sub-areas. These sub-areas should, as far as is conveniently possible, be paired, one being a sub-area with generally high rental values and one being a sub-area with generally low rental values. Each such pair of sub-areas, upon the completion of the common water meter system therein, shall be referred to as a "metered area" as referred to in the attached schedules. (4) Article 2 of the aforementioned contract dated February 28, 1930, shall not apply to users who use water solely for manufacturing purposes, that is, any user with a private well who can prove to the satisfaction of the Company that his business must use both well water and Company water and who, in addition to paying the meter rates specified in Clause 2 of Schedule C attached hereto, pays a monthly fee equal to the price of water supplied by standby water as specified in Clause 4 of Schedule C attached hereto, according to the size of the water pipe, may be supplied with water by the Company for manufacturing purposes. However, the application of this clause shall be limited to those who have already built water wells on the date of signing the main contract, and the Company may refuse to enter into a new contract to supply such water at any time if the Company deems that the supply of such water is not appropriate due to loss of revenue or any other reason, but shall notify the Municipal Council of its intention to refuse to supply such water within a reasonable period of time. (5) Schedule C attached to the aforementioned contract dated June 19, 1929, and Articles 3 and 4 of the contract dated February 28, 1930, are hereby repealed. [Signed] Li Lubokeer, Director, Shanghai Waterworks Company; Walker, Secretary; MacKean, Acting General Manager, Public Concession in the Foreign Settlement area north of the Shanghai Yangjingbang. (Note: Water Price Schedule C omitted.)</p>
<h3 id="e128">Opposition from All Sectors <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' Federation has decided to firmly oppose the implementation of the new water meter system by the British Waterworks Company, which increases the burden on citizens during a period of economic downturn after the war. It has decided to negotiate with the Municipal Council as soon as possible to oppose the new articles of association of the Waterworks Company and restore the original method, in order to reduce the burden on citizens. It has also requested the assistance of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association has also sent a letter to the General Manager of the Municipal Council to correct the new articles of association of the Waterworks Company. The entire Chinese board of directors is studying and considering the case.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Urgent Notice <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association yesterday issued an urgent notice to its members, which reads as follows: "Dear Sirs, With reference to the waterworks issue discussed at the Association's general meeting on May 14, the following resolutions were passed: (1) All landlords are hereby notified to immediately dig their own wells for use, in order to avoid being arbitrarily exploited by monopolistic businesses. (2) All landlords are hereby notified to refuse to sign the new waterworks contract with unilateral demands and unilateral benefits, in order to avoid future troubles. Even if the water supply is cut off, the water cutoff will be held responsible for obstructing people's livelihood and peace. (3) A letter will be sent to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company to maintain the Association's original resolutions: (A) Water meters will not be collected on behalf of the company, in order to avoid losses from compensating or advancing water bills. (B) One water meter per household will ensure fairness and avoid situations where those who use less water pay more and those who use more water pay less. (C) Users shall not be responsible for the installation or deposit of water meters. (D) The water price is too high and does not meet the economic capacity of Shanghai users, nor does it comply with the good practices of a monopolistic business. The Association's original resolutions will be supplemented as follows: 'Before water meters are installed throughout the entire supply area, a flat rate system may be temporarily used, but when the water company voluntarily collects water bills directly from users, the water bill included in the flat rate rent should be deducted in accordance with the facts, and the users should pay it directly to the water company.' (4) A letter will be sent to the Municipal Council to inquire why the draft of the new contract with the water company was not published in advance to solicit users' opinions before it was signed and came into effect, and to state that the water company is attempting to force the signing of the new contract by cutting off the water supply, which is a sign of contempt for the status of our industry and a deliberate obstruction of people's livelihood and peace. The relevant information is hereby transmitted, and it is hoped that you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly, as it concerns the survival of our industry." (New Voice News Agency)</p>

<p>Talks About Impressions of Visiting China</p>
<p>The Terror of the Japanese Invasion of Shanghai</p>
<p>The Good Custom of the Chinese Respecting the Elderly</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on the 19th that Countess Glanston gave a speech at the Overseas Companions Association today, detailing the impact of the Japanese bombing of Shanghai. She said that when she first arrived in Shanghai, she did not see the commercial recession that she had seen elsewhere. She was deeply surprised, as Shanghai was a prosperous area where everyone seemed happy. However, when she returned to Shanghai after touring the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, she saw that Shanghai's business and commerce were simply lifeless, and the streets were full of pitiful refugees fleeing from the war zone. The Countess remarked that she initially enjoyed her tour of China, but after the invasion, she was left with this terrible impression. When she was in China, her white hair was her most valuable treasure, because due to her age, the Chinese respected the elderly and treated her with courtesy. This is truly a rare and precious custom, she said.</p>

<p>Enthusiastically Donate to the Northeastern Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association has been actively engaged in assisting the Northeastern Volunteer Army. Since the fundraising advertisement was published a few days ago, patriotic people from all walks of life have been extremely enthusiastic. The association yesterday received a notice from the Shanghai Siming Bank that Xu Lianfang, Zhu Shunong, and Shi Jishan had donated 50 yuan, as per receipt number one. The Commercial Savings Bank also notified the receipt of 91 yuan and nine jiao from Xiangxi people, as per receipt number one.</p>

<p>After the Zhabei police authorities were taken over, Huang Ming of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Zhabei Office was responsible for making arrangements and has restored the area to its former appearance. Residents returning from the road are fully loaded with boxes and belongings, and the crowded situation is even greater than during the war. However, the residents no longer look as worried as before. Regarding the distribution of defense, in addition to Pingzeng, the 179th Squadron of the First Police Brigade of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has also been allocated to maintain public order. As for the selection of squadron leaders, Jiang Shengtao, the captain of the First Squadron, is a graduate of the sixth class of Whampoa Military Academy and served as a battalion commander in Fang Zhenwu's army for many years, repeatedly performing heroic deeds. Sheng Zeqiu, the director of the first branch of the Fourth District, also serves as the captain of the Ninth Squadron. The garrison location is temporarily within the jurisdiction of the Fourth District. The locations of the sub-offices in the Fifth District have not yet been determined. The household registration survey in the jurisdiction of the first branch of the Fourth District has been completed. It is reported that Director Sheng is a graduate of the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy and has served as a regimental commander in the National Revolutionary Army. Last year, he served as a training officer in the police brigade headquarters of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and as a military instructor at the Shanghai Local Autonomy Training Institute. Recently, he was appointed as the captain of the eighth squadron of the police brigade (now the ninth squadron) and stationed on the Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, performing his duties diligently.

<p>Sends Letters to the Telephone and Waterworks Companies</p>
<p>Demanding at Least One Quarter of Free Service in the Hongkou Area</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation sent letters to the Waterworks Company and the Telephone Company yesterday, which read: "According to a letter from the temporary office of the Hongkou District branch of our association, since the January 28th Incident, businesses throughout the city have been suspended and the financial system has stagnated. Residents in the war zone have been buried in the ravages of fire and the desolate fields. Those who were lucky enough to escape death could only flee and wander, enduring unspeakable misery. Even residents of the concession, who enjoy the security of the Municipal Council's police force, such as those in our Hongkou District, were occupied by the Japanese army as soon as the Shanghai Incident began, and the entire district was plunged into chaos. It suffered the scourge of war just like the war zone, and suffered even more from the massacre and torture of the Japanese army. Therefore, during the war, the footprints of the Chinese in areas such as our Hongkou were cut off, and the streets were like ghost towns. These facts are well known to both Chinese and foreigners. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been initially reached and residents are gradually gathering, it is expected that recovery will be difficult in the future. Therefore, our association proposes that the fees for telephone and water services, which were mostly unused during the war, should be waived for one quarter. This is the minimum requirement and is not an unreasonable request. We have informed all branches to notify all members to stop paying the fees until the negotiations are concluded, in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and help the market."</p>

<p>Recognizing That Chinese Officials Still Cannot Exercise Their Authority</p>
<p>Fearing That the Concession's Sanitation Will Be Affected</p>
<p>At the Municipal Council meeting on the 18th of this month, the Director of the Health Department reported again on the cleanup issue in Zhabei. According to Dr. Zhou Deng, Director of the Health Department, to the Director-General, it is necessary to resume work in the first district (near McLain College) and the second district (in the vicinity of Dixuwei Road and North Sichuan Road) in order to prevent the concession from being affected by sanitation. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the Chinese authorities will exercise their authority there in the near future, so there should be no objection to this move. The Chinese authorities have been notified of the intention to resume work. The Board of Directors then resolved to approve the Director of the Health Department and the Director of the Works Department to resume cleanup work in the two districts.</p>

<p>Appeal to the Ratepayers' Meeting</p>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Donations</p>
<p>The North Zhejiang Road and Boundary Road trade associations yesterday sent a letter via a representative from the Anle Daqi Society to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, requesting them to negotiate with the Concession authorities for exemption from the spring general donation and the summer certificate donation. The original letter is as follows: "To the esteemed Shanghai Ratepayers' Association, we write to inform you that our districts, adjacent to the North Station and particularly at the intersection of the Chinese and Concession territories, have been under immense strain since the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Gates were firmly closed, guards were heavily enforced, and transportation was severed, leading to a complete standstill in commerce. The people here were in a state of utter isolation, surrounded by desolation, almost like an uninhabited area. Residents who could not escape had no way to survive. Even those who were fortunate enough to flee had no homes to return to. The extent of the losses suffered in these two to three months is immeasurable. Many were bankrupted by the war, and others have yet to reopen their businesses, accounting for more than half of the total. This is a testament to the terrifying state and severe hardship of those days, which is painful to even speak of. Recently, the municipal general donation and certificate donation have been collected with great urgency. Merchants and residents have suffered losses due to the war and their assets are completely depleted. With no avenue for appeal, they can only endure everything from the donation collectors without daring to resist. It is deeply regrettable that while merchants and residents have always fulfilled their tax obligations in the past, they are now losing their rights. We believe that exempting the spring general donation and the summer certificate donation for the period of the war is a proper relief measure. Therefore, we dare to present the details and request your association's Chinese directors to fight for our cause based on reason. We would be deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association."</p>

<p>Famous Female Explorer Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Miss Clairesse Marks</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the famous British female explorer, Miss Clairesse Marks, arrived in Shanghai during her honeymoon trip around the world after marrying an Englishman, Mr. Fesyu, in California, USA, on March 13th of this year. Miss Marks is one of the world's most renowned female explorers. In the past nine years, she has often funded her own expeditions to rarely visited places. She once traveled within the Arctic Circle, from Lapland to Russia, accompanied only by four Lapland guides, traversing icy and snowy terrain for sixty-seven days. She has also explored the wilderness of Mexico and hunted wild beasts in the Rocky Mountains of America, the Himalayas of Asia, and the Congo of Africa. This year, she originally planned a second expedition to Tibet, but it was cancelled due to a tropical disease contracted last year on the banks of the Amazon River in South America, which required a long period of convalescence as advised by her doctor. Miss Marks is proficient in astronomy and drawing. Wherever she explores, she relies on astronomical observations to identify directions, draw maps, and collect scientific specimens. Many of her works are now housed in the British Museum and other institutions.</p>

<p>The Japanese Marine Corps north of the Zhabei Railway, when on patrol near Zhonghua Xin Road and Pengpu Xin Bridge, had several Japanese soldiers suddenly disappear at night, along with several firearms. The Japanese Command suspected they had been hidden or harmed by local thugs, so the next morning, they imposed a special curfew, closing the railway gates at both Gonghe Xin Road and Taiyang Temple, prohibiting pedestrian traffic for two days. They also dispatched a large Marine Corps force of about three to four hundred men to search house to house north of the railway, without success. Afterwards, they sent soldiers with bamboo poles, iron hooks, and fishing nets to dredge various rivers, such as Zhangjia Bang, Tan Jia Wan, Su Huai, Yu Gang, and Tanzi Guan, but found no trace. Yesterday, it was heard that the Japanese military authorities, with the withdrawal from north of the railway imminent, needed to quickly investigate the missing Japanese soldiers and firearms. Therefore, yesterday they again dispatched a large Marine Corps force, carrying a large number of hemp bags and bamboo poles, and conscripted many laborers to fill hemp bags with mud, blocking the rivers, and draining the accumulated water to facilitate the search for the missing Japanese soldiers and firearms. However, from morning to dusk, they found nothing.</p>

<p>Zheng Kang Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment and a Fine of One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Zheng Kang from Ningbo opened the Dafeng Cotton Yarn Shop on Xinxin Bridge Street in the French Concession. Last year, he disguised spun yarn with enemy goods and mixed it with the "Zhong" brand yarn from the Shenxin Spinning Factory. After Shenxin discovered this, they reported it to the police, who sent detectives to seize 43 bales of stolen yarn and took Zheng into custody. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and sentenced to eight months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred yuan. Zheng refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Gu Jirong to file an appeal. The Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, along with two judges, Li Changnian and Xiong Yinping, held a joint court session and announced the end of the debate. They ordered Zheng to pay a deposit of five hundred yuan as bail, pending the scheduled pronouncement of the verdict. Details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Yesterday was the day of the verdict. In the afternoon, at 3:00 PM, President Wang, along with the two judges, Li and Xiong, arrived at the Second Criminal Court and summoned Zheng to court.

Zheng Kang's attempt to obtain illegal property benefits through fraud was sentenced to two months imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan. If the fine is not paid, he will be supervised in prison, with two yuan equivalent to one day. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined will be converted to one day of imprisonment for every two days, or one day to two yuan. The 43 bales of cotton yarn are confiscated.

<h3 id="e157">Trial Opens for Rent Exemption Case in Tongchunfang <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>No Hope for Reconciliation in this Case</p>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for the 26th</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army began attacking Zhabei on January 28th, the battle spread to Shanghai after the 19th Route Army stood up in resistance. All industries came to a standstill, and the citizens suffered heavy losses. Although the ceasefire and troop withdrawal have taken place, the prosperity of Shanghai has not been immediately restored. Due to economic exhaustion after the war, citizens have launched a movement to reduce or exempt rent during the war, in order to ease the burden slightly. The Citywide Rent Reduction and Exemption Committee decided on the methods of reduction and exemption based on the severity of the damage and submitted them to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance. On the landlord's side, those who deeply understood the situation voluntarily reduced rent for two, three, or four months, but those who were unwilling to compromise at all were quite numerous. For example, the landlord of Tongchunfang in North Haining Road, China Land Company, was unwilling to reduce rent because the area was far from the war zone. However, its tenants requested that the rent for February and March be completely exempted according to the decision of the Rent Reduction and Exemption Committee. The opinions of both sides clashed, and reconciliation was unsuccessful. Although the tenants paid the rent arrears up to January first, the landlord's broker, the British company Ewo, was still unwilling to accept it immediately. Pan Shidun, Wu Linkun, and Chen Zhongyin, three lawyers, filed a lawsuit against 17 tenants, including Yongkanghao, for rent arrears. All foreign business owners in this city are paying close attention to this lawsuit. The outcome of this case will determine their standard for dealing with tenants' requests for rent exemption in various unresolved rent issues. Yesterday, Magistrate Lou of the First Special District Court opened the trial. Most of the defendants appeared in court together. Eleven of them jointly hired Yue Junying as their lawyer. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the amount of rent owed by each defendant. Then, he stated that Tongchunfang was located in the central district and was not affected by the war at all. Moreover, the businesses operated by the defendants, such as hotels, restaurants, cigarette paper shops, and pharmacies, made three times as much profit during the war. According to the工部局's regulations on wartime tax reduction and exemption, all of the central and western districts are not exempt, which shows that the central district is indeed a safe place and there is no reason to exempt rent. All foreign commercial property groups are now watching the outcome of this case, as a trial run for the judgment. As the rent reduction movement committee is a private organization, the plaintiff absolutely objects to the defendants' request to reduce or exempt rent based on this organization. Finally, he recited the letter from the Rent Reduction Committee to the plaintiff's lawyer and strongly criticized the wording in the letter. Then, the defendant's representative, lawyer Yue, stated that the letter was issued by another organization and was not relevant to this case. Then, he admitted that there was no error in the amount of unpaid rent claimed by the plaintiff. However, he said that the rent should be divided into three periods. The period before January 28th was the first period. The defendants had long wanted to pay the rent during this period, but the plaintiff refused to accept it, so it was deposited in this lawyer's office and is still with the case. Please ask the plaintiff to verify and accept it. February and March are the second period. At this time, Japanese soldiers invaded the territory, and cannons were fired continuously. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce announced a strike to resist the enemy, and the shops could not operate. How could they have the financial resources to pay rent? According to the Civil Code and precedents, if the leased property cannot be used due to force majeure, there is the right to request rent exemption. From April onwards, it is the second period. The property in this case was only transferred to the current owner in July of last year. At that time, the plaintiff verbally allowed the tenants to follow the previous custom that lawsuits would not be filed for rent arrears of less than three months. Therefore, even if it is decided in the future that the rent for February, March, etc. cannot be exempted, it is still not time to pay it, and the plaintiff should not file a lawsuit. The plaintiff's lawyer responded to each point of lawyer Yue's defense. The two sides argued back and forth endlessly. Magistrate Lou persuaded both parties to compromise, abandon the law, and reconcile, because the case was caused by the Sino-Japanese War and not only one industry was affected. However, the opinions of both sides could not be reconciled, and reconciliation was hopeless. Then, the defendant's lawyer paid the rent for January that the defendant had brought to the court to the plaintiff for acceptance and the plaintiff's lawyer revised the amount of the lawsuit. Then, Magistrate Lou announced that the verdict would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on May 26th.</p>

<p>Zhang Ruichun, 41 years old from Jiangyin, lived at No. 10 Renjin Lane, Yuezhou Road. He had a cooked meat stall at Hongkou Triangle Market. There was a shoemaker from Jiangbei who had a shoemaker's stall nearby for years, and they were both acquaintances. Two months ago, the shoemaker had purchased five intestines from Zhang on credit, totaling 100 cash, which he had not yet paid back. Later, Ruichun had asked him for it once. A few days ago, Zhang brought old shoes to the shoemaker for repair, but he did not pay for the repairs at the time. Yesterday, the two met on the side of the vegetable market, and the shoemaker immediately asked Zhang for the repair fee. Zhang also replied by asking for the money owed for the pig intestines, which led to an argument, followed by violence. The shoemaker happened to have a carrying pole in his hand, and he struck Zhang's chest with the pole, injuring his internal organs. Zhang vomited bright red blood on the spot and fainted. The police officers who heard the news rushed to the scene, detained the shoemaker and sent him to the police station for questioning. The injured man was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Extorting $2,000</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Piji, the owner of the Wang Jusen Iron Shop at No. 9 Jingshou Lane, Wuhu Road, suddenly received threatening letters starting on the 5th of this month, intending to extort $2,000. The letters contained threatening words, saying that if he did not comply, he would be kidnapped, and the ransom would then increase to $30,000. Wang ignored the letters at first. However, the gang continued to send letters, reaching six in total. Wang then reported the letters to the police station for investigation. On the 18th, Wang received a seventh letter, asking to meet at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday in a deserted area next to the Xujiahui Railway. The person who came was to put the money in a cigarette paper box under the coffin, but the amount gradually decreased from $2,000 to $200. Wang then reported to the Old Gate Police Station, and sent Detective Chief Hole, Chinese Detective Lang Zuyin, and Chinese Detective Bao Yusi to go to Xujiahui with Wang Piji. They put a cigarette box under the coffin and then dispersed and ambushed. Before long, a Shanghai gang member, Shen Licang, arrived and wandered around the area for a long time, for about an hour. The Chinese and foreign detectives, seeing his suspicious behavior, stepped forward to arrest him and took him and the cigarette box back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court One of the First Special District Court. According to the police lawyer Ru Baoyi's statement of the case, and submitting the seven threatening letters as evidence, and according to the plaintiff Wang Piji's complaint of the previous situation, when questioned, the defendant confessed that he was a foreman at the plaintiff's shop three years ago, and now he is in extreme poverty, so he resorted to this tactic. All seven threatening letters were written by him alone. After investigation, President Qian Hongye sentenced the defendant Shen Licang to three years imprisonment and confiscated the seven threatening letters.</p>

<p>Awaiting Forensic Examination for Further Review</p>
<p>Zhong Yuehua, a 15-year-old from Jiangbei, was an apprentice at the Qin tailor shop at No. 1047 Yongxiang Lane, Donghanbili Road. On the morning of the 25th of last month, at 11:00 AM, she was chopping wood at the back door when Zhou Gendi, a six-year-old girl from Shaoxing, a neighbor, was harassing her. Zhong angrily struck the girl's private parts with the axe handle. The Jiuxing Road Police Station was notified and sent Detective Zhou Kaiwen to take Zhong into custody and send her to the First Special District Court. Details have been reported in this newspaper. During the postponement, the girl's condition worsened at the Guangren Hospital, and she died at 11:50 AM on the 17th. The body was sent to Fielun Road for examination. Zhong was punished by the court. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong held a trial at Gao Yi Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and said that the Guangren Hospital doctor examined the body and found that the girl Zhou Gendi's vaginal bone was broken, which was fatal, and there were X-ray photos to prove it, but it was slightly different from the examination by the court's forensic doctor. The photos were presented for inspection. The court ordered forensic doctor Wei, who had examined the case, to come to the court. The X-ray photos were given to Wei for review. After examining the photos, forensic doctor Wei said that the girl's private parts had been swollen for a long time, and the swelling had subsided. The X-ray photos were presented in court for study during the trial, etc. According to the girl's mother, Zhou Zhu, she told the defendant that if the injury was serious, she would be severely investigated, and she also told the owner of the tailor shop about the matter. She only had this daughter and asked for justice. When questioned, Zhong Yuehua denied hitting the girl's private parts with the axe handle, saying that she fell on her own. She hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Judge Shen ordered her to be remanded in custody, pending forensic doctor Wei's appraisal and further verification from the Qin tailor shop owner.</p>

<p>The Chinese Thrift and Virtue Society was originally a pure public organization formed by Chinese people. For over a decade, it has enjoyed an outstanding reputation. Since Wang Chengdian assumed the position of Director-General, he has devoted himself even more to social endeavors, achieving remarkable results. During the recent Shanghai Incident, the society was unfortunately in the direct line of fire, and its premises were occupied by the Japanese military. The details of these events were reported in various newspapers at the time. Subsequent investigations revealed that while the society's building still stands, the internal losses were substantial. Most of the historical documents and important ledgers from previous years have been scattered and lost. It is now reported that the society's board of directors and committee members, in light of the current societal extravagance, believe that the society, with its duty to correct social customs, should restore its original state as soon as possible to maintain public welfare and seek the well-being of its members. In addition to having already reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping, they are currently undertaking reorganization, and it is expected that the society will soon regain its former appearance.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e176">Drafted by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<h3 id="e177">Three-Year Education Plan (1) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Education in Jiangsu Province in recent years has been hampered by financial difficulties, preventing progress. Furthermore, those administering education have often treated it merely as a means of livelihood, perfunctorily fulfilling their duties. Administrative organs have been constantly besieged, preoccupied with dealing with requests for funds, and have lost their function of supervising and promoting education. Since Zhou Fo-hai assumed the position of Director, he has achieved some success in managing provincial education funds and rectifying local education. Now, there is a proposal for a three-year plan. Here is a summary of the draft.</p>
<h3 id="e178">First Goal <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The goal of this plan is to achieve the following effects within a short period of three years: (1) increase enrollment opportunities for school-age children, reducing the number of children out of school by 5% each year; (2) increase literacy opportunities for illiterate adults, reducing the number of illiterate people by 10% each year; (3) ensure that students graduating from schools who wish to serve society possess sound service abilities and the qualities expected of a citizen; (4) ensure that graduating students who wish to pursue further education have the academic ability to do so.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Second Content <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>To increase enrollment opportunities for school-age children, universal education should be actively promoted. To truly universalize compulsory education, the training of teachers is a prerequisite. To ensure that graduating students have sound service abilities, the content of vocational schools should be enriched. To reduce the number of illiterate people year by year, the implementation of literacy education should be strengthened. To ensure that graduates have the ability to pursue further education, the level of secondary education should be improved. Therefore, (1) universalizing compulsory education, (2) expanding normal schools, (3) enriching vocational education, (4) raising the level of secondary education, and (5) promoting literacy education are the central tasks of this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Third Basis <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The educational funds of Jiangsu Province, in terms of education, include the busy canal surtax, slaughter tax, and various other taxes, with an annual revenue of approximately 2.8 million yuan. Furthermore, the funding for National Central University has already been transferred to the central government this year. If the assessed amount can be collected in full, then specialized education, vocational education, normal education, and social education can be enriched and developed. As for local education, the total educational expenses of all counties in the province have reached over 12 million yuan. Although the actual collection amount in the autumn audit each year often differs from the assessed amount, if we calculate based on the actual collection amount averaging over 60%, then it should be at least over 7.5 million yuan annually. In terms of educational institutions, the province has 21 middle schools, 16 normal departments, 2 specialized schools, 6 rural normal schools, 15 experimental primary schools, and 4 vocational schools. In the counties, there are over 70 middle schools, 48 normal schools, and a total of 13,756 grades in primary schools, with approximately 580,000 students enrolled. The number of children out of school is still around 3,995,296. As for illiterate people, there are 25 million, accounting for nearly 80% of the population of 32 million. However, overall, the current state of education in Jiangsu Province is showing signs of exhaustion. The reasons for this can be summarized as two points: (1) The province's and local finances have long suffered from the problem of nominal revenue exceeding actual expenditure, and there has been no effective rectification. The extravagance and disorder of local finances are even more difficult to address. Furthermore, disasters and warfare have repeatedly occurred, leading to the accumulation of huge debts in provincial and county finances, making auditing difficult and resource extraction impossible. Maintaining the status quo is already difficult, let alone expanding. This is due to the lack of development caused by financial difficulties. (2) Because local finances have accumulated excessive debts, educational personnel feel insecure. In addition, factions are divided, each establishing its own camp, engaging in mutual attacks and exclusion, both overt and covert. As a result, lawsuits against bureau chiefs, encirclements of education bureaus, assaults on bureau members, and strikes for salary have become common practice. The chaos in local education is on the verge of being irreparable. This is due to personnel disputes that have led to the increasing deterioration of local education. Given the current state of education in Jiangsu Province, any practical plan should rigorously rectify what needs to be rectified and strive to expand what urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, the implementation of this plan must be divided into specific steps.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Fourth Steps <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The current state of education in Jiangsu Province shows signs of exhaustion. If it is not thoroughly rectified from all aspects, the foundation cannot be stabilized. Without a solid foundation, talk of progress will only lead to confusion and ineffectiveness. Therefore, thorough rectification must be carried out first, and then gradual expansion should be planned within the possible scope of the current provincial and local economy. Therefore, the implementation steps of this plan are set as: the first year will be the rectification period, and the second and third years will be the expansion period.</p>
<h3 id="e182">First Year: Rectification Period <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>During the implementation of the rectification plan in this period, in order to thoroughly rectify from all aspects, the Department of Education has already formulated "Measures for Evaluating County Magistrates' Education Management Performance" and "Regulations for Evaluating Education Bureau Directors" to assess educational administrators, promulgated "Regulations for Managing Budgeting of County Education Funds" to eliminate the problem of nominal revenue exceeding actual expenditure, revised the "Regulations for the Organization of Education Bureaus" to save administrative expenses, conducted special inspections to thoroughly address the education in counties with the most disputes, and divided old debts from new revenues to determine a method for repaying old debts in order to facilitate the progress of education. Furthermore, strict orders have been issued to all county education bureaus to eliminate extravagant spending, and education bureaus with uncleared accounts have been given deadlines to expedite the clearing of accounts. In addition to the above, the following items should be implemented:</p>
<p>1.  Rectify various sources of funding</p>
<p>(A) Negotiate methods of coordinated collection. County treasuries have become accustomed to fraudulent collection practices. Therefore, it is necessary to negotiate with the Department of Finance to determine appropriate methods of coordinated collection to prevent treasuries from concealing and delaying payments.</p>
<p>(B) Rectify school land, school rent, education surtaxes, and slaughter taxes. The problems with school land and school rent in various counties are also deep-rooted and urgently need thorough rectification, as well as a reasonable increase in rent. There is also room for rectifying and increasing education surtaxes. If the slaughter taxes in the province can be further rectified, there is still potential for an increase. The revenue from the three items of rectification and increase should be used to enrich the content of compulsory education and social education in various counties.</p>
<p>2.  Increase the number of students in each grade of primary schools throughout the province</p>
<p>The total number of primary schools in Jiangsu Province is 8,199, with 23,756 grades. The average number of students per grade is approximately 40. Each grade should be increased to 50 students. Based on the original number of grades, this year alone, an additional 137,560 school-age children can be enrolled.</p>
<p>3.  Improve primary school teaching methods</p>
<p>Local primary schools should be urged to study multi-grade teaching and single-grade teaching, and efforts should be made to organize workshops or encourage correspondence schools.</p>
<p>4.  Improve private schools</p>
<p>Although the enrollment rate of children in the province is over 14%, the number of children attending private schools should not be less than 10%. Therefore, at a time when compulsory education funds are not yet sufficient, improving private schools is a crucial task. Private school registration, private school teacher registration, and private school teacher certification should be implemented to achieve the goal of transforming private schools into formal schools.</p>
<p>5.  Rectify the academic atmosphere</p>
<p>Correct the frivolous and romantic tendencies and cultivate a pure and studious atmosphere.</p>
<p>6.  Actively improve normal education</p>
<p>There are only 16 normal departments in provincial middle schools, 6 provincial rural normal schools, and 43 county normal schools in the province. The total number of graduates from provincial and county schools each year is approximately 1,700. However, there are already many who pursue further education or switch to other occupations. Even if all of them could serve in primary schools, assuming one teacher per grade, this number of 1,700 would be significantly insufficient to cover the 13,756 grades. Therefore, during this period, in addition to the Department of Education continuing to implement primary school teacher certification to provide relief, the improvement plan for normal education includes three items: (A) implementing the independence of rural normal schools, (B) gradually implementing the independence of normal middle schools, and (C) establishing normal specialized schools.</p>

<p>Education Funds for the 21st Year</p>
<p>The previous year's budget was over 2.73 million yuan</p>
<p>Proposed to be reduced to 2.42 million yuan, a decrease of 310,000 yuan</p>
<p>Hangzhou dispatch: The organizational charter of the Zhejiang Provincial Budget Committee has been approved by the provincial government. The committee members consist of all provincial committee members, the Secretary-General, the President of the High Court, and the Director of the Security Bureau. Zhou Junyan, Director of the Department of Finance, and Lu Dai, the Secretary-General, were elected as standing committee members. The first review meeting was held at the Department of Finance at 2:00 PM on the 18th. The budget committee members present included Zhou Junyan, Yang Mianzhong, Chen Bulei, Wang Chengying, and Lu Dai. Review committee members included Li Ziying, Chief of the Third Section of the Department of Finance, and Secretary Xu Maolai. The meeting was chaired by Zhou Junyan. The first phase of the review focused on the funding of educational institutions, so the relevant officials from the Department of Education were also invited to attend. It is reported that the budget matters are handled by the Third Section of the Department of Finance. Therefore, all budgets are first reviewed by Chief Li Ziying of the section and then submitted to the committee for discussion. Director Chen Bulei of the Department of Education explained the reasons why the reductions could not be made according to the central government's instructions. The total expenses of educational institutions in the 20th year were over 2.73 million yuan, and it is proposed to reduce them to over 2.42 million yuan in the 21st year, a reduction of approximately 310,000 yuan. The result is still good. If all provincial institutions can follow suit and seriously reduce expenses, the income and expenditure can be expected to balance.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Records of Striking the Bell at an Ancient Temple (1): Not Removing the Weeds in the Courtyard of the Village School Teacher <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>"Records of Striking the Bell at an Ancient Temple" is a notebook written casually by a bell-striking worker, not a systematic work. In it, you can see how he integrates his own life with the lives of everyone in the village, big and small, depicting the movements deep in their hearts. You can say it is his autobiography, or you can say it is a living history of a small society. Society is the school, and living is education. Then you can say it is a portrait of a school or a small shadow of education. This text is written with ant-like small characters on the bell he strikes, from the inside to the outside, from the bottom to the top, covering the entire bell weighing 108,000 jin. The bell-striker did not leave his name because his job is striking the bell. When he was young, people called him Bell-Boy; when he grew up, people called him Mr. Bell. He silently accepted this title. His notebook also has content but no title. Please allow me to title it "Records of Striking the Bell at an Ancient Temple" and introduce it to everyone.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Everyone says that the temple where I live is the oldest temple in the world, but when asked which dynasty it was built in, no one in the village can answer. The annual rings of the two pine trees in front of the temple tell people that they have stood there for 1,500 years. However, it would be too arbitrary to assume that the age of this ancient temple is the same as the size of the pine trees. But the people in our village do not have the time to study these things. What they still say is, "The oldest temple in the world!" If there are guests, they always proudly point to the ancient temple and say, "This is the oldest temple in the world!" Once, a tourist came and, hearing this boast, told the guide, "Humanity has existed for a million years, and before humans, the earth exploded from the sun 200 million years ago. Before the earth, the arrangement of stars in the entire universe had already existed for billions of years. What is your few thousand-year-old temple?" Although his words were reasonable, we could not refute him at the time. But afterwards, we thought that we also had reasons to defend the ancient temple. This temple is older than any house in the village. The oldest old men in the village say that their grandmothers and great-grandmothers had made wishes and burned incense here. Indeed, this ancient temple has witnessed the fall of the Han people twice and twice taken China back from the hands of others.</p>
<p>Zhejiang and Shanxi Provinces Opened the Earliest</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has investigated and compiled statistics on the teaching affairs of citizen schools in various provinces and cities. The important matters are extracted below.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the opening of citizen schools, Zhejiang and Shanxi provinces were the earliest (in 1919), while Yunnan, Ningxia, and Weihaiwei were the latest (in 1931). Two districts were opened in each of the years 1924 and 1925, four districts in 1927, two districts in 1928, six districts in 1929, and one district in 1930. (2) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Shanghai, and other seven provinces and cities have established ordinary citizen schools and also set up advanced citizen schools or advanced classes. Yunnan is planning to set up advanced citizen schools. The remaining fourteen provinces and cities only have ordinary citizen schools. (3) Only Gansu province has full-time teaching staff, while the rest are part-time. Their qualifications are mostly secondary school graduates, with a small number of social education agency personnel serving part-time. (4) Teachers' salaries: Yunnan province is purely voluntary. Shandong is the highest, with monthly salaries ranging from 20 to 50 yuan. Hubei's full-time teachers receive 45 yuan per month, Ningxia 20 to 40 yuan, Sichuan and Weihaiwei 4 yuan each. In addition, four provinces offer less than 10 yuan per month, one province 6 to 16 yuan, two provinces 10 yuan, three provinces 12 yuan, one province 15 yuan, one province 6 to 40 yuan, and four provinces 20 yuan. (5) Sichuan province adopts a system of separate classes for boys and girls, Henan has separate schools for boys and girls, and the rest are co-educational. The largest percentage of boys is in Rehe, accounting for 98%, and Shandong 95.2%. The smallest percentage is in Shanghai, accounting for 44%. The largest percentage of girls is in Shanghai, accounting for 56%. The smallest percentage is in Shandong, accounting for 4.8%, and Rehe 2%. (6) The lowest age of students is 8 years old, and the highest is 61 years old. Rehe is 8 to 49 years old, Hubei 10 to 20, Beiping 10 to 30, Nanjing 10 to 50, Gansu 12 to 30, Jiangnan 12 to 32, Guangdong and Shaanxi both 12 to 46, Anhui 12 to 43, Shandong, Qingdao, and Chahar all 12 to 45, Zhejiang and Ningxia 12 to 50, Weihaiwei 12 to 48, Shanghai 12 to 56, Sichuan 13 to 56, Jiangsu 14 to 50, Henan 14 to 61, Shanxi and Suiyuan 15 to 38, and Yunnan 16 to 40. (7) Three districts have a study period of three months, fifteen districts four months, one district three to six months, one district four to six months, and six months and one year each in one district. Regarding opinions on the length of the study period, four months is the basic principle. Five districts advocate not extending it, one district advocates extending it by half a month, four districts by one month, and three districts by two months. In reality, one district has already increased it by two months and one district by eight months.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Bao Shan Education Bureau Strives to Restore Education <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Transferring 15,000 Yuan from the Relief Association</p>
<p>To Prepare for Selective Repairs and Sustain Education</p>
<p>During the Songhu Battle, Baoshan bore the brunt and the entire territory was occupied. Cultural institutions, being objects of enemy aversion, were especially devastated. Now that the enemy has retreated and the territory is being reclaimed, efforts should be made to restore them. Pu Wengui, the director of the county's education bureau, sent a special letter to the War Relief Association yesterday, requesting a loan of 15,000 yuan to facilitate selective repairs and procurement, so as to restore the original state as soon as possible. The letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Relief Association: Respectfully, during the Songhu Battle, our county bore the brunt, and the educational institutions suffered heavy losses. Subsequently, due to the retreat of our troops to the rear defense, the entire territory was occupied, and the cultural institutions were further devastated due to enemy aversion, destroyed almost completely. Once detailed investigations are completed, we will report and request funding for relief. Although the ceasefire and troop withdrawal have occurred, the wounds are deep and restoration to the original state is extremely difficult. The county's education budget averages over 10,000 yuan per month, with 70-80% coming from land taxes. Last year's poor harvest due to floods forced us to borrow to survive, which was already difficult to sustain. The impact of this war has halted tax collection, and with the exemption of urgent grain transport, there is no source of income, leading to financial exhaustion and a desperate situation. How to raise regular funding in the future has already been reported to the provincial authorities for approval, along with a request for an advance allocation of 15,000 yuan for temporary losses for various schools, to facilitate selective repairs and procurement, so as to restore the original state as soon as possible. To date, there has been no approval. With resources running out, coping is difficult. Therefore, we specifically request that your association, considering the importance of local education and the potential for school children in the disaster area to be deprived of education, find a way to transfer a loan of 15,000 silver yuan from the relief funds received by the county. Once the provincial funds are claimed, or when the county's share of education relief funds is obtained, the loan will be repaid as soon as possible, in order to address both needs and sustain education. We would be endlessly grateful. Addressed to the Baoshan War Relief Association, Director Pu Wengui.</p>
<p>Report to the Provincial Education Department: Report concerning the request to instruct the War Relief Association to approve the allocation of school loss funds. The Shanghai Incident occurred, and this county was forced into the intense firing line, causing significant damage to various educational institutions. Subsequently, due to the retreat of our troops, the entire territory fell into the hands of the Japanese army, and cultural institutions were further devastated due to enemy aversion, destroyed almost completely. Once the military situation settles, a detailed investigation will be conducted and reported. This unprecedented catastrophe is heartbreaking to contemplate. Although a ceasefire agreement has been reached and troop withdrawal is imminent, restoring the original state is extremely difficult. The county's education budget averages over 10,000 yuan per month, with 70-80% coming from land taxes. Last year's poor harvest due to floods forced us to borrow to survive, as reported in previous submissions. The occurrence of this war has halted tax collection, and with the exemption of urgent grain transport, there is no source of income, leading to financial exhaustion and a desperate situation. How to raise regular funding in the future is a matter to be decided. We request that you, sir, consider that local education is vital to the nation, and that school children in the disaster area face the risk of being deprived of education. Please promptly approve and instruct, and also request a report to the provincial government to allocate 15,000 yuan from the war relief funds for the war loss expenses of various schools, to facilitate selective repairs and procurement, so as to restore the original state as soon as possible. We are awaiting your instructions with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, Director of the Baoshan County Education Bureau, Pu Wengui.</p>
<h3 id="e188">A Record of Inspection of the Severely Affected <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Lida Academy</p>
<p>Total Losses Exceed 140,000 Yuan</p>
<p>丨 Production Education Institutions Should Be Restored Urgently 丨</p>
<p>Lida Academy, being at the epicenter of the Jiangwan War, suffered severe damage. Yesterday, this reporter accompanied the academy's representatives, Mr. Yu Shikuang, Hu Husheng, and Li Zhongming, to inspect the site. The situation observed was extremely tragic. The buildings set on fire and destroyed by the enemy include three teacher and staff dormitories (multi-story buildings) and over fifty large and small chicken coops. Those bombed by enemy aircraft include a girls' dormitory and junior high classrooms (multi-story building), the First Farm Factory, a greenhouse, a teacher's residence, and a breeding chicken farm office. The estimated cost of these destroyed buildings alone is over 50,000 yuan. According to reports from academy representatives Kuang Husheng and others, other losses include over 5,000 volumes of books, over 30 cabinets of instruments, over 300 sets of desks, benches, beds, and over 400 breeding chickens, over 8,000 pounds of honeycomb foundation, over 900 bottles of honey, over 20 boxes of breeding bees, and over 500 boxes of student belongings, with a total value estimated at over 90,000 silver yuan. Moreover, the losses incurred by the Nanxiang branch and the furniture, luggage, and books looted from over ten faculty residences are incalculable. The academy is the most successful promoter of production education in Shanghai, and most of its assets were accumulated through the frugality of teachers and students over the past seven years. The losses suffered are truly regrettable. However, it is heard that the academy's directors, Yi Yincun, Li Shizeng, and Wu Zhihui, are all strongly advocating for restoration, and it is hoped that their efforts will soon be realized.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Financial and Gold Markets Experience Occasional Turmoil <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Taels of Fluctuations. Yesterday's Gold Price Auction Was Quite Turbulent. The fluctuations were unstoppable, rising and falling a total of fifteen taels. The net decline was only five mace. The market was flat in the morning and unmoved by the fall in the silver market. Afterwards, foreign exchange was nominally flat but effectively strong, and the exchange rate was slightly down. The resolve of the dealers was firm, and the buyers were emboldened, pushing the price straight up to the skies, soaring ten taels, and breaking through the 730 tael mark. At noon, it seemed there were more sellers, and the price immediately declined. Later, there were rumors that Japanese military personnel strongly opposed the Suzuki Cabinet, and with the excessive abundance of foreign exchange, major players excitedly sold off, causing a plunge of ten taels, settling at 715 taels, before returning to a more stable trend. The detailed account of the day is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e191">Vigorous in the Morning, Subdued Later. Opening Price for July <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The opening price for July was still 719 taels and 5 mace. The large silver bars continued to fall by a quarter, and both public and private telegram prices for silver fell by 3/8, but the European market was weak, and there were few sellers. Next, it was 18 taels and 8 mace. Then, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yong Qian, Chang Xiang, Shunli, Hengchang, Yongyu, He, and others entered the market to buy, and the price immediately rose by 5 taels. Furthermore, with the initial settlement price for August US dollars at 31.1875, and only 31 yuan fluctuating slightly, at 9:15, it was 24 taels and 2 mace. Soon after, Tai Chang, Yuan Mao, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong, and others sold, yielding by 2 taels, to 22 taels. When the HSBC exchange rates were announced without change, the price was 22 taels and 7 mace, while internally, it strengthened further. The central bank sold June US dollars at 30.375, and August at 875. The central bank then entered an order, and Qian Chang, Xiang, Yifeng, Yong, Hengchang, Yongyu, He, and others bravely advanced, causing the market price to jump by more than 7 taels, reaching 32 taels and 2 mace at 10:00. The fluctuation was just over one tael every half hour. Afterwards, Xie Xing, Yong Yi Cheng, Bing Xing, and small brokers like Sima Lisi sold off, followed by Wan Xing Shunli. As the US dollar seemed to ease, half a yuan could be settled for June, and HSBC offered 875 for August, which Sumitomo absorbed, causing the gold price to drop sharply by over 3 taels. After 10:30, it was 26 taels and 7 mace, recovering by 2 taels ten minutes later, but after 10:45, it declined again. Hong Kang Yong and most long positions exited, and at 11:10, it was 25 taels and 2 mace. Suddenly, it was rumored that a certain bank was absorbing spot goods, and US and Japanese banks were trading August US dollars at 4375, pulling the price up by 2 taels again, reaching 27 taels and a half at 11:30. But Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Dalian gangs, etc., came to sell, and with HSBC selling to Sumitomo recent British gold at 9375, the price plunged by 4 taels, reaching 23 taels and 3 mace at noon, then closed at 4 taels and 7 mace. The listed price remained at 793 taels, ranging from 70 taels to 63 taels. The noon closing was 70 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sharp Decline in the Afternoon, Moderate Closing <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 24 taels, then 24 taels and 8 mace. After 2:15, a strong wind suddenly arose, as there were reports of turmoil in Japanese politics, leading to frequent easing of exchange rates. Various banks sold, with June US dollars initially at 75, then 31.125 for settlement, and Shanghai offering 6875 for September, and HSBC offering 18.1875 for the first order. On the trading floor, Yi Feng, Da De Cheng, Bing Xing, Yuan Da Yong, etc., sold quite a bit, causing the market to fall into a slump, plunging by ten taels, to 15 taels at 3:30. With limited fluctuations in between, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Kang Yong, etc., took the opportunity to enter, and small retail short positions also covered. Moreover, with a wheat company absorbing September US dollars at 31.5 yuan, it pulled up by 4 taels and a half, reaching 19 taels and a half at 4:15, then fell slightly by 1 tael, to 18 taels and a half. By the 4:30 closing, it was 19 taels, only down 5 mace from the previous day. The maximum fluctuation for the day was 32 taels and 2 mace, and the minimum was 15 taels, a total fluctuation of 15 taels and 2 mace.

<h3 id="e194">Foreign Exchange Tightened and Then Became Deficient <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Numerous Transactions Between Banks</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to shrink, and exchange rates fell back. However, HSBC's listed rates showed a reduction of one yuan for francs, a small decrease of 0.25 for German marks, an increase of 0.25 for Japanese yen, and an increase of 0.125 for Hong Kong dollars, to 77 taels. There were no changes in other currencies such as British pounds, US dollars, Indian rupees, and Singapore dollars. As for the transaction prices between banks, they were tight at first and then became deficient, with slight fluctuations. In the end, the closing prices were no different from the previous evening, causing the gold market to rise and then fall, with a net decrease of only a few mace. However, the turbulence was great, due to the impact of the political turmoil in Japan. Transactions by Chinese merchants and speculators were still active. The number of British pounds traded amounted to 100,000, with slight increases and decreases among various firms. There were numerous transactions between banks.

<p>Foreign Exchange Is Not Weak... Market Prices Are Still Flat</p>
<p>Market Overview: Today, the 20th, is the due date for the comparison period. In prosperous times, this would be a busy period. Now, with the closing period also scheduled at this time, there is potential for a significant event in theory. However, due to the post-war desolation, the market is empty, and it is not easy to restore the former state. Therefore, yesterday's market was relatively strong for foreign exchange, but the closing was weaker. As for market prices, they were generally in a depressed state, which is lamentable.</p>

Although the afternoon market was active, the buying and selling forces were equal, resulting in the premium price being the same as the morning market. The "Silver Discount" was 7 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day, with an additional 8-9 fen for water.</p>

<p>Yesterday (20th) the condition of the various bond markets at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange: Spot transactions were scarce, with only 8,000 yuan in and out for various bonds. The futures market was as flat as before. The morning was also quiet, and the trading sentiment was particularly lukewarm. Trading in both markets amounted to only over 900,000. The afternoon market was slightly more active, with a total of 1.7 million yuan traded, totaling 2.66 million yuan. Among them, the 20th Customs, Consolidated, Unified, and Salt Tax each accounted for 400,000-500,000, while the others were only around 200,000 yuan. As for the trend in the prices of various bonds, the stable situation remained unchanged from before, while the stagnation had increased compared to before, as the price of each bond only fluctuated by 3-4 jiao throughout the day. The morning's two markets showed no change, with extremely flat supply and demand. In the afternoon, the market's buying sentiment was slightly more active, and prices uniformly rose. However, the trend remained consistently stable. As a result, the prices were higher by 2-3 jiao compared to the previous day. The current cargo of the entire Sixth Issue futures and demobilization are separate, and the current cargo has fallen slightly. The current cargo of the 19th Customs small bills has fallen by one yuan compared to the beginning of the month. The situation in the bond market is still as gloomy as before.</p>

<p>(American Eastern Bank Report)</p>
<p>Recently, the New York stock market has reverted to the fatigue of last week. On Thursday, the trading volume was only 700,000 shares. The market news was dull and unremarkable. Buying and selling were limited to "insiders." Industrial stocks showed a slight rebound, while utilities and railroads were weak, especially railroads. However, this company received a telegram from "Pierce" yesterday, stating that the prospects for utility stocks were good, because the general public believed that utilities could maintain a sound approach, and there was hope for profits this year. The opening on Thursday was generally lower than the previous day, but buying sentiment for industrial stocks was strong, especially for "US Steel," because the recent steel conference was filled with optimism. Mr. Schwab, the leader of US Steel, had a particularly firm attitude, but his report stated that the five representative companies in the US steel industry had a shortfall of 25 million yuan in dividends and other expenses in the previous three months. In general, the prospects were still very weak. It is expected that the trading market will not improve for the time being. The Dow Jones daily index is attached on the left.</p>

<p>Human auction transaction volume sets a record low</p>
<p>The market was open for only fourteen minutes</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is extremely bleak and the situation is very dispersed. Because the economy is still difficult to restore to the previous state of relaxation, everyone holds a stable approach to speculative transactions, and no one dares to act rashly. Therefore, the business hours are very short, the blackboard is opened very frequently, and the transaction volume is greatly lacking. The current yarn business is extremely quiet, and the mood of each gang is clear. Judging from the general situation, there is no hope for improvement in the short term. The investigation of the financial situation in the interior is still extremely dry and difficult, and it is difficult for commerce to develop. Moreover, the world yarn market is trending downward. If the actual demand stagnates for a long time, the future will be even more worrying.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Blackboard Opens Frequently at Yarn Auction <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>At the human auction in the morning market, although foreign cotton rose, the trading in the market was very quiet, and each month rose slightly by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, the business hours were only fourteen minutes, and the transaction volume was a new record low since the exchange's operation, which shows the sluggishness of the business. Each month was down 1-2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was only 2,000 bales. The sellers were Yuanda (300 bales), Gengfeng (200 bales), Changji (100 bales), Zhenda (100 bales), and Dafeng (100 bales). The buyers were Tongfu (200 bales), Zhenda (150 bales), Renfeng (100 bales), Taichang (100 bales), Taixing (150 bales), Hengyi (100 bales), and Tongyu (100 bales). The closing prices for the human auction are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Auction Closing Prices Compared to Previous Day's Account Balance September 1540 Up 2 22,950 July 1534 ... 15,000 October 1541 15,150 August 1537 Up 2 21,450 Total... 64,550</p>

<p>The sales are very quiet. According to statistics from various gangs for the whole day, the total number of bales bought was 300. 75 bales were from fellow merchants, and the price trend was falling. 92 bales were from Yunnan, 28 bales were from the interior, 15 bales were from Southeast Asia, 7 bales were from Ningbo, 70 bales were from Shantou, 65 bales were from Guangdong, 10 bales were from Wenzhou, 10 bales were from the northern gang, and 100 bales were released from the Shenxin factory.</p>
<h3 id="e202">There Is a Small Amount of Emptying in the Cotton Market <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market started strong and then weakened, but American cotton rose again, and gold prices tended to rise, which made people feel slightly firmer. However, the overall situation is still not good, because the actual demand is extremely sluggish, and factories have no way to manage it. Moreover, since American and Indian cotton are absorbing sufficient amounts, there are very few inquiries about local cotton. As for foreign cotton and foreign exchange, although they are firm, the combined silver plate is still cheap, so most people are paying attention to the weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Cotton Auction Started Strong and Then Softened <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>At the Zheng auction, the market opened in the morning with foreign cotton rising and the gold market firm. A portion of the market was emptied, and each month rose by 1 qian. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere softened again, and each month fell by 1 qian to 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 4,300 dan. The sellers were Tonghu (300 dan), Fuyuan (400 dan), Yifeng (300 dan), and Gengfeng (200 dan). The buyers were Changfeng (1,600 dan), Changhe (200 dan), and Yuanda (200 dan).

<p>The present cotton business is greatly lacking. All factories have no intention of purchasing, therefore no transactions have taken place in the last two days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was stagnant and unremarkable. The industry generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Futures rose three to seven points, spot prices rose ten points. English cotton futures fell three to five points, spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton market was closed.

<p>The highest price for foreign silkworm cocoons is only thirty-five yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the failure of sericulture last year, silkworm farmers in various towns and villages of Haining mostly incubated foreign breeds, and the native breeds left were kept for non-incubation. Unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable, and the new cocoons only yielded slightly more than 30% of the harvest. Very few cocoon firms opened for business. Although the goods arriving on the market these days are not seen to be flourishing, cocoon prices are surprisingly low. The highest price for foreign breed cocoons only opened at thirty-five yuan. Native breed cocoons are not collected, purely affected by the restricted cocoon prices, and the cocoon cost for each dan (unit of weight) for silkworm farmers must pull in fifty-six yuan, resulting in huge losses. Most are taken back for self-drying and reeling to produce native silk for sale. Therefore, the amount collected by various firms is not much.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Qimen Black Tea Trade Still Active <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Ningzhou tea opens at a low price</p>
<p>Since the official opening of Qimen tea trading the day before yesterday, yesterday, firms such as Jardine Matheson, Tientsin Union, Duddell, and Jinlong all started operations. The total transaction volume in the city was more than 1,800 boxes, and the transaction was quite active. However, the firms are still strict with the market prices, and Chinese tea merchants suffer significant losses. Ningzhou black tea, the market also opened yesterday by Duddell at eighty-five taels, which is thirty taels lower than last year. The overall trend of black tea was not considered very optimistic last night. For Su'an Zhenmei green tea, Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms are keenly interested, but the market price fell to one hundred and thirteen taels, which is fifty to sixty taels lower than before, and tea merchants have no profit to gain.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Tea Industry in Hekou is Sluggish <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The town of Hekou in the Gan area has always been known for its thriving tea industry. In recent years, due to the frequent activities of the communists, the Hui merchants have completely lost their capital, causing the tea industry to decline sharply. This year, there are only two tea factories in the area, both established by local merchants. These businesses specialize in black tea. It is heard that due to the sluggish market, the tea price is only around thirty yuan, which is not actually expensive. As for the green tea produced in Huangyuan, Geyuan, Anhua, and other areas, because no foreign firms are taking the lead, they are all being converted into maoqing tea in order to sell through local shops.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Grain and Rice Market is Dull and Sunny <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The rice industry stops measuring for four days during the settlement period.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Yesterday, thirty to forty ships arrived in the Huangpu River, and the inventory in the Huangpu River is still thick. The appetite of the stores on this street is not good. Due to the sunny and hot weather, and the approaching end of the general settlement period, Changshu and Wuxi Japonica rice is falling at any time, and Zhongguan goods have fallen nearly one jiao. Early and late rice open 500 shi for the whole day, the market is tired at two jiao, and the foreign Lu sharp tip sells fine, and the price changes to Yin Yuan to sell two Xie, and the market trend is stable.</p>
<p>North Shanghai Yesterday's arrivals were still strong, and the stock along the Suzhou River was still abundant. Transactions in this city were few. Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou and other white japonica rice each fell two jiao, and the sale of thin rice and early rice was particularly slow, with prices short by one jiao. There are still a few customers for foreign Lu sharp tips, and the opening is stable. According to the news from the Rice Merchants Association, measuring will be stopped for four days from May 29th of the lunar calendar, which is the period for all firms to return the balance, and measuring will resume as usual on June 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Futures Foreign Rice is Continously Being Sold Off <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market, the Yangtze River merchants still have no way to dispose of it, and the appetite of the inland merchants is still strong, but because foreign firms are very diligent in selling futures, the futures Saigon rice for June and July is continuously being sold off, and the market is being softened as a result. However, it is rumored that the futures rice sold by the foreign firms this time is the goods that Japanese merchants have processed but not loaded in the place of origin, and entrusted Western merchants to sell on their behalf. Whether this statement is reliable has not yet been confirmed, but the foreign merchants who are selling these days are not purely British merchants. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson sold 300 tons of No. 1 long-grain Saigon rice for late June at a price of 5 taels and 4 and a half qian. Recently, 200 bags of Qialadi brown rice for delivery in one week were sold at a price of 10 yuan. The spot price for small Jiao rice was 10 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 10 yuan and 4 jiao, and old small Jiao rice was 10 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, and Mingdang rice was 1,000 bags, at a price of 11 yuan to 10 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. Most of it was purchased by inland households, and only a small number was occupied by this street, but this street and the country Zhuang purchased 1,000 bags of Wen Zhou rice at a price of 10 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, and 500 bags of Jiangxi Ji Yuan at a price of 14 yuan and 4 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Production Decline Causes Flour Market to Rise Sharply <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday the flour market was quite good. Because each factory has reduced the number of vehicles, the shipment has been small, and it is also heard that certain large factories are planning to completely shut down to repair the machinery. After the shutdown, there will be no more flour shipments, and the inventory is limited. Therefore, people are hoping for good things. Yesterday, there were still several customers who purchased, and the market was firm. After the opening price, it once jumped up, and the closing price was firm. Old car brand flour in May was 2 taels and 4 and a half fen, and warship flour was 2 taels and 3 and a half fen, which were both more popular than the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association cleared the market, and the transaction was very active, the buying was smooth, the household shipments were scattered, and the market price rose sharply. The transaction price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar reached 13 taels and 3 qian and a half, the price of Xiamen goods was 13 taels and 2 qian, and the price of high goods was 13 taels and 5 qian.

The transaction of Taikoo sugar is still quiet, CX Mark is 15 taels and 5 qian and a half, and HM Mark is 14 taels. The trend is also quite firm and stable.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Piece Goods Actual Sales Are Stirring <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Goods prices are still mostly falling and few rising</p>
<p>Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the piece goods market has shown a slight turning point, but it is still difficult to reverse the decline due to the influence of abundant inventory and the revival of Eastern goods. Therefore, in recent days, there have been more declines than rises. However, since the weather has become hot, actual sales have gradually started to stir, because the purchase of summer goods has become imminent. In terms of goods prices, most have fallen to the bottom, so those who were waiting to see before now want to take action. Yesterday, Western goods were most active with bleached cloth, and both the Northern and Yangtze River merchants had transactions. Bao Shun Da Ying Xiong was 10 taels and 2 qian and a half, Gongping Jin Qian Bao was 10 taels and 5 qian, and Taihe Lan Da Lu was 11 taels. The demand for Tiaozifu poplin on this street has also improved compared to before.

<p>The old man rests at nine o'clock in the evening. He gets up around four in the morning. During sleep. Never cough. Not to mention spitting phlegm. The day the reporter visited. It was a quarter past seven in the morning. He was already busy with breakfast. He drank coffee soup. A piece of bread. Soaked in the soup. Take it for digestion. He ate and talked, with great interest.</p>
<p>You came really early. I got up a little late today. I didn't get up until a quarter past four. However, there are also three hours since you came.</p>
<p>Very strange. Old people suffer from insomnia. Only I can sleep until dawn. However. Honestly lately. I often hear about the Japanese bullying the Chinese during the day. I am very upset. Sometimes I can't sleep at night. My cultivation is not enough to suppress the hatred in my heart.</p>
<p>Damn Japanese. (Slapping the table) I don't know why the grievances. Must use vicious methods. Harm our innocent people. Damn government. (Slapping the table) This time he dared to sign a ceasefire agreement. Be Japan's "accomplice". I was stimulated like this. I can't sleep. I am ultimately one of the more thoughtful people in China. It has been so since I was a child. My mind is often spinning. So fleeting. Easy to forget.</p>
<p>I went to Shanghai in the winter of 1851 (the first year of Xianfeng). I was only eleven years old at that time. After arriving in Shanghai, I entered Xuhui College. Xuhui College was founded in 1839. When I entered the school, there were forty students. About a year after entering the school. I just started reading foreign texts. At that time. The ancient Chinese books. I have already finished reading everything.</p>

<p>The wife of the king is called the queen. The president's wife is called the First Lady. Who in this world is not pampered and superior to ordinary people. But the wife of Soviet Russia's Dictator Stalin is an exception. Madam is thirty years old. There are two children. Currently studying at a vocational school in Moscow. It is expected to become an expert in manufacturing man-made silk. Classes are held four days every five days. (The fifth day is a Russian day of rest) Currently in the last year of the third year. There are six students in the same class. Madam is the only female student. Diligent and hardworking. Very respected by the professors. During the holidays, most of the other students hang out in the school's dining halls. Madam always uses the remaining time to handle work outside the duties of the Secretariat. Madam's grade. The results are the best in the whole school. Classmates call it "Lu" to honor it. The school authorities always post their grades. As a model for all levels. And encourage the students to strive for progress. Madam's study at the school is not to enjoy special privileges because of her high position. Occasionally violates school rules. Receive the same treatment as other students. A large black board hangs in the main corridor of the school. The surnames of all students who do not come to school for no reason are marked in the list of absentees. One day Madam's name. Also seen on it. The following note stated that three days were missed during the sixteen-day course. And borrowed two books from the school library. Overdue. Madam is in school. Wearing a coarse cloth jacket. Always concentrating on research in the chemical laboratory. Studying tirelessly. After graduation. Will serve as a responsible executive committee member in the Soviet Russian weaving industry. Or a key technical position. Alas. It is truly admirable that a noble lady can condescend to study. Expect to benefit the country. Those heads of state who indulge themselves with the people's fat and ointment should be ashamed to death.</p>

<p>A woman who lives with skeletons Miss M.L. Tildesley of England was recently appointed administrator of the human osteology department at the Royal College of Surgeons Museum in London. She spends almost all of her working hours with the bones of dead people. There are a total of 6,000 skeletons and several thousand other types of human bones in the room. Among them are more than 3,000 years old. It is truly rare that a young woman can be in such a gloomy and terrifying environment and still enjoy it. According to her, "The purpose of collecting so many human bones in the Department of Human Osteology is to study the racial peculiarities of all mankind. It is possible to discover that each race has its own characteristics. Among them, there is one of the oldest skeletons, which has been handed down from the earliest Stone Age, which is the most valuable. I hope to get a skeleton of a big Hollywood movie tycoon or a movie star and a financial magnate in the future for my research. That would be interesting."</p>

<p>— Fengji</p>
<p>The "Historical Records of the Huns" mentions the strange animal camel. It is also known as the camel. It is produced in the northwest provinces. And the Outer Mongolian area. Transporting goods all depends on it. Wealthy families. Raising camels is countless. Or transport goods by themselves. Or rent to others. Get a very good profit every year. Camels are cold-resistant and heat-averse. Ugly and strange in shape. Grayish yellow in color. Long neck. The head seems to be looking up. The back is high and raised. Like a saddle. The hooves are huge like cows. In summer, the hair falls out completely. Only the skin and bones remain. That is, drive to the mountains to eat grass. The proverb so-called "putting green" is also. It gradually becomes fat after autumn. Re-enter the pass. In winter, the hair is like a thick blanket. People want to carry. That is, bend the feet to it. If the strength can win, then stand. If you can't win, you won't get up even if you whip it. About 400 pounds can be loaded. More than double the mule.</p>
<p>Camels travel mostly at night. About a hundred miles. When the sun rises, they stay in the store. (There are many camel shops in the north, which are very grand and spacious, and do not house mules and horses.) Because the mountain roads are narrow and dangerous. There are many cars and horses. Afraid of crowding. And avoid the scorching sun. The neck is tied with a copper bell. You can hear the sound two miles away. Each group has more than one hundred heads. There are sixty or seventy heads less. Each camel driver leads twenty heads. Lead with a small lamp. Each goes in order. There is absolutely no mess. It is either up or down. Either fast or slow. As soon as you raise your whip, you respond like a reverberation. There is another chief man. Knows the camel's nature. Good at treating camel diseases. So the maintenance is careful. The husbands all accept his command. But if you are not deeply experienced. Can not fill this role.</p>
<p>Out of Jiayuguan. There is more sand and less water. There are occasional undercurrents. The camel knows the veins of the water. When it encounters it, it stops. Step on the ground with your feet. Dig it and get water. There are also many hot winds. It hurts people and animals very badly. When the wind is coming. The camel knows it. That is, lead the neck and call. Bury the mouth and abdomen in the sand. People always take it as a sign. Support the felt curtain around the four weeks. Enter to avoid its disaster. (Anyone who walks on the grassland must carry a felt curtain. Or make it of coarse cloth. Or make it of felt. There are those who are more than ten feet long.)</p>
<p>In the Gansu and Xinjiang area. Documents are carried by camels. Can be five hundred miles a day. Because the sandy land is open and wide. The pace is large and the speed is fast. Its speed is like wind. Mulan's poem says. The swift camel has a thousand miles of foot. It should not be a false statement.</p>
<p>There is a water bag under the neck. Always store water for backup. People also often take its water to drink. Can withstand hunger. Do not eat or drink for half a month. Walking as usual. Its hair can be used as a mattress. Quite warm. Its skin and bones. It is also a major export.</p>
<p>In the desert area. The path is dangerous. Without camels, there is no way to trade and transport. Communicate with each other. The sky gave birth to this strange animal. There must be a reason.</p>

<p>— Kaixu</p>
<p>American flying hero Colonel Lindbergh and his wife. When he came to China last summer. It was during the flood in various provinces of Xiang and Hubei in our country. Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh embrace the heart of compassion. Once assisted diligently in disaster relief work. Tirelessly. The names of Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh. Have been engraved forever in the heart edition of the beneficiaries of my Chinese. Never forget it. The former Lindbergh's beloved son was kidnapped. Has been looking for a long time. Our people cannot but sympathize with him. Hope his beloved son will return soon. I don't know if our country's government authorities have any consolation. Or have it and do not know that this move is related to the friendship between the two peoples. Should be given appropriate publicity. A few days ago, the remains of Lindbergh's young son were found in the wilderness. The doctor examined it. Determined to have been brutally murdered before his death. The kidnapper is vicious. Then vengeance and the infant. Our people heard it. It is even more hair-raising. And before that, Mrs. Lindbergh was eager to see her son. Once the daily eating habits of his son. Loaded all over the newspapers. In order to hope that the evil spirits will pity and care for the infants. Add care. Today's ending is like this. How can you not be sad. Since the Lindbergh kidnapping case occurred. The national outrage in the United States. Reached the extreme. The public's seriousness in detecting this case. It has also exhausted intelligence. It can be seen that the spirit of the rule of law country. Seeing human life is too important. Do not neglect it with one infant. Our people are admiring it endlessly. But unexpectedly, there are well-known people in this society. Take advantage of people's danger. Trying to make huge profits by taking advantage of this. Spare no effort to hinder the progress of the investigation. This is a truly unpredictable intention. There is only one rule for both China and foreign countries. The mastermind of this scam is John H. Curtis, who, after the Lindbergh kidnapping case occurred. Accompanied by a pastor. And a retired Navy Rear Admiral. Offered to Lindbergh and a retired Navy Rear Admiral. From to from The pastor's name is Rev. H. Dodson Peacock, and the Navy Rear Admiral's name is Rear Admirel ouy Hamilton Brrrageo, and Pi Bai is actually being fooled by Kou. These three people. The righteousness belongs to the same village. All for the Norfolk city of Virginia. And all are well-known in society. And especially Rear Admiral Bai is the most.</p>
<p>Colluding with riotous parties. Frame the young master. Set fire to seek money. Adulterous occupation of the master is completely opposite. One makes people respect. One makes people hate women.

More show its wolf heart. Forced his wife to take poison. Old people stick to justice. Killed the traitor. Counting his lifetime of evil deeds. It is already intolerable in the world. Died a violent death. The guilt is more than enough. The two stories mentioned above. It is seen from the "Old Beijing" sound film of the Star Company. At that time, it gave me a lot of feelings. It is the same servant. Behavior. Today, it is滔滔. How many Li Yuqing's crowds. Want to get Gao Sheng its people. Is it not difficult? Alas.</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness, the Owner of Qi</p>
<p>Chapter Seven, Gaining Access to the Rich and Powerful Often Causes Generals to Fall, Quietly Confined in the Prison of Love, Soldiers Can Husband Cages</p>
<p>Wei Zhuomou's answer was the most interesting. He said that young people in love. No one can avoid unexpected encounters or twists and turns. If you encounter such things. It is best to follow nature. Because there is no strong person in the world. Can resist the control of that era and fate. It is better to take this opportunity to experience more worldly affairs. In order to penetrate life. And gain the most bright and wise understanding and awareness. Like your marriage. And the progressive cooperation of you two. No matter what the path is. And how it will evolve in the future. Can always be in the end on the life problem I said. Make the soul get a kind of most subtle and most valuable progress. Apart from agreeing, what else can I say. Moreover, I am also the original introducer. Should also serve as this ready-made matchmaker. As for Li Wenxia that side. The love is not opportune. Originally there is no need to force. Also not necessarily her loss. I don't believe in the world of men and women. Who must not become a family with whom. It is also not who and who can not do husband and wife. Go with the flow. It's good to let it go naturally. Call me to persuade her. I am confident that I can also persuade. You two can rest assured. But Liang Xiaoyun is too worried about gains and losses. Still trying to do his best to prevent leisure. Since getting married. Become a ceremony. Guarding An Yutian is still inseparable. Secretly ordered all the servants in the house. As if announcing martial law so tightly. If any woman comes to find Mr. An. All stop the car. All incoming letters must first be secretly handed over to her for careful inspection. Do not hand it over directly. Treat An Yutian as a love prisoner in house arrest. Today is on the fourth day. Yesterday because it was a lucky day, I was busy and very tired. Originally I didn't want to leave An Yutian and go out. Just for hearing that Ye Zuozhang will be out of Beijing to return to office. If you don't hurry to contact. I'm afraid it will delay the big event. I reluctantly went to Ye's house. Before going out, I really ordered the servants at home. Tell them to be extra careful to guard. And coaxed An Yutian a lot. Said that she would be back in a while. You have a good rest at home. Never run around. But unexpectedly, after she went out, she lingered for a long time. Also know that the crisis is so many. He is also naturally active. I am afraid that I can't stand this loneliness. Don't be careless for this moment. It's no coincidence that something went wrong. So Fang's heart was jumping around in the car. In fact, she was too worried. He first made a verbal engagement with Li Wenxia. It was originally out of a momentary emotional impulse. And was introduced by Wei Zhuomou to meet Liang Xiaoyun. Make his vision of female beauty more artistically exquisite and sharp awareness. It has gradually felt that Li Wenxia's random head and rough clothes. Although it can be misinterpreted as healthy beauty and natural simplicity. Actually just an ordinary girl in the countryside. Absolutely not as famous as Liang Xiaoyun. But still recognized Liang Xiaoyun as out of reach. Did not dare to pursue it and settled for his duty. Still perfunctorily maintained the old agreement with Li Wenxia.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Yong, once created a university, participated in the war twice, is indeed a fashionable figure standing on the front line of the current era,</p>
<p>Only for the divorce case with his wife Jiang Jintao, the court has ruled to divorce, and Feng paid six million yuan in alimony. Feng resolutely disagreed and was willing to taste the flavor of the iron window. From the perspective of a third party, Mr. Feng is still not beautiful in the beautiful, Feng already has Russell's new partner, and the couple's relationship has been cold to 0 degrees. Divorce or not divorce is not a problem. However, Jiang Jintao was abandoned in middle age, and the family's happiness was completely bankrupt. What is the meaning of the rest of his life? If Feng Jun closed his eyes and thought for a moment, he would definitely have a heavy and painful mark imprinted on his conscience,</p>
<p>Not to tear down a concubine is not a good man, and not to make a divorce is not a rich man. Divorce between men and women is the most fashionable and interesting trick in modern times. Assuming that a fashionable celebrity who has suddenly emerged is still sleeping with a yellow-faced wife at home, this is not what a wise man who knows current affairs would do. Therefore, if you want to be a rich man, divorce is a necessary condition. Try to see that since recent years, from the deposed Emperor Xuantong (the case of his divorce from his concubine last year) to the small three and small ducks in Jiangbei, no one is not making a "tear down a concubine" and "talk about divorce" gimmick. Several well-known lawyers who have eaten their fill specialize in doing this business of "tearing down mandarin ducks and dividing them in two". Famous scholars in Jiangnan are as numerous as lawyers, covering up their cards, and the four major problems of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are solved from this,</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to be a rich man, you must divorce. If you don't divorce, you can't be a rich man. This is considered to be the two richest clichés in the modern golden rule,</p>

<p>— Yunli</p>
<p>Candles are an important part of our daily necessities, as everyone knows. But do we know the raw materials and methods of manufacturing them? The method of candle manufacturing is very simple. This simple and easy home industry is what our country needs most urgently. So I am here to introduce it.</p>
<p>(1) Method of Selecting Raw Materials</p>
<p>Beef tallow, mutton tallow, palm oil, coconut oil... all can be used to make candles, but the candles made from these oils are not very good. When burning, they either have a foul odor or emit soot. Therefore, in order to avoid these drawbacks, the factories now use paraffin wax and stearin wax to manufacture candles. Because the candles made of these two waxes are not only harder, but also shiny and lovely. When burning, there are no drawbacks such as soot, bad smell, and bending, and the fire is brighter and more durable, so they are quite popular with customers.</p>
<p>(A) Paraffin Wax: Also known as paraffin, this wax is found in both petroleum and wood oil. The method of extraction is to take out the residue after distilling these two oils, add strong sulfuric acid, and the impurities contained in the oil will be completely digested by the strong acid, and the paraffin wax will float on the water, solidify into a solid, and be taken out and washed with clean water to become paraffin wax.</p>
<p>(B) Stearin Wax: Mostly contained in beef tallow and mutton tallow. The method of extraction is to first put water into these two oils, then put them together in a pot and heat them. When the oil is completely melted, add lime milk and simmer over fire. The oil will be transformed by the lime into calcium oleate and calcium stearate, which will condense each other, and a yellow liquid floating on top is stearin wax. The above two materials, made in the United States, are the best, and Mobil Oil Company sells them.</p>
<p>(C) Candlewick: Can be made of very fine cotton yarn. But pay attention, when knitting, it must be soaked in medicine water once, so that the candlewick has alkaline properties. After the candle is extinguished, the candlewick will also be extinguished, so there is no danger of burning into the oil. The candlewick should not be too thick or too thin. If it is too thick, the burning heat will be too high, and the melted wax will not be enough to absorb, resulting in soot, so the candle will not last long. If it is too thin, the melted wax cannot be completely absorbed by the candlewick, and it will flow down from the side of the candle, which is even more uneconomical.</p>
<p>(2) Method of Proportioning Raw Materials</p>
<p>The amount of raw materials for candles must be different according to the different temperatures in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The temperature in summer is the highest, use eight and a half or nine parts of paraffin, and ten or twelve and a half parts of stearin; the temperature in winter is the lowest, use nine or nine and a half parts of paraffin, and half or one part of stearin; in spring and autumn, the temperature is moderate, use ten or eleven parts of paraffin, and seven or seven and a half parts of stearin. As for the end of spring and the beginning of autumn, the temperatures are different, and the proportioning will also change accordingly. In short, use more stearin when the temperature is high, and use more paraffin when the temperature is low.</p>
<p>The proportioning of the amount is closely related to the quality of the candle. The above proportioning is what I have tested. If readers can test out a better proportioning method, please also publish it in the newspaper for research and to revitalize the industry. Due to space limitations, I will talk about the procedures for making candles tomorrow.</p>

<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>The ship, which had traveled thousands of miles, was gradually slowing down as it neared its destination. Mr. C, who was traveling in steerage, saw the tall Western-style buildings from across the swaying willow branches on the opposite bank, as well as the wide and flat roads, and the trams and cars that shuttled back and forth... He was silently reciting the beautiful names such as "material civilization," "cultural center," and "the most prosperous area in East Asia."</p>
<p>When the ship was about to dock but had not yet docked at the ×× port, suddenly, with a loud noise, many people wearing coarse cloth short clothes, occasionally mixed with a few people in felt hats and long clothes, rushed from several small boats, desperately fighting to approach the passengers, shouting loudly, "Peace Hotel," "Shenjiang Hotel," "Gaosheng Inn," "..."</p>
<p>Mr. C, who had just come out of the mountains, was examining what was going on when, in an instant, someone was already bending over on his deck chair and suitcase, and pasting a few colorful round pieces of paper like plasters.</p>
<p>"How many pieces of luggage, sir?" The man straightened his waist and said with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Four pieces, large and small," Mr. C replied unconsciously; at the same time, the words "×× Hotel, spacious rooms, cheap prices..." printed on the oval paper pasted on the luggage were very clear and tempting to his eyes.</p>
<p>"Okay! Let's get off the boat!" he said, pulling the luggage.</p>
<p>"No, I'm going to take a train to Nanjing right away!"</p>
<p>"That's fine too! Go to the hotel first, wipe your face, wash"</p>
<p>a bit, rest for a while, besides, the train is going to..."</p>
<p>"Ah San, come here!" Then another young man ran over, and the two of them seemed to be "making a fortune," with a kind of victorious light shining in their eyes, and they picked up the luggage and left. Mr. C had no choice but to follow them! As soon as they landed, a horse-drawn carriage, as if it had been waiting for Mr. C for a long time, pulled him up and ran away. In a short while, they arrived at the so-called spacious and clean hotel, which was actually in an alley!</p>
<p>Mr. C did wipe his face, and also drank a glass of soda and ate a meal, and the waiter sent a bill.</p>
<p>The bill is as follows:</p>
<p>Room fee: Three yuan and forty cents</p>

<p>— Xinxiu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I visited an old friend, Mr. W. As soon as we met, he said to me, "You came at the right time. I was just about to tell you about my first grand enjoyment in my life! Riding a flying sedan chair." I listened and asked inexplicably, "What? The rich old men in Shanghai only take cars and airplanes. Where did you pick up this new trick? Are you kidding me?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, it's really what people call a flying sedan chair, and the one I rode was a four-person flying sedan chair! The more important and wealthy people are, the less likely they are to be invited to ride it. On the other hand, the ignorant country bumpkins often have the qualifications to ride it. But for me, it was the first time. Although it was a waste of fifteen dollars, I gained some knowledge." His words made me even more confused. I hurried to ask him to explain what was going on.</p>
<p>He then got to the point and said, "The night before last, I passed a road. Several women who made a living by selling their bodies were standing in the oblique wind and drizzle. The light of the light green lamp shone on their powdered faces, making them look even more pale and pitiful. I thought that we are all the same, but they have been working on the street for many years, eating the wind and dew, doing this lowly business. I couldn't help but feel compassion for them and looked at them blankly with pity in my eyes. Who knew they would shout, 'Go! Go for a ride!' Everyone swarmed up, and four people lifted me up from front, back, left, and right, and walked into the alley without my feet touching the ground. I had no choice but to become Zhang Xueliang's comrade and let them do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>They dragged me into the room and chattered nonsense to me. They were busy with tea, cigarettes, and melon seeds. I refused everything and just closed my eyes, like an old monk in meditation, ignoring them. Suddenly, they started to take off my hat, untie my clothes, and pull off my pants... If I still acted like Comrade Zhang at this time, I would lose my virginity! I have never been to a brothel in my life, and I have guarded myself like jade! I hurriedly resisted with all my strength, and they stopped attacking and said, 'Let's go, let Ah Cai sleep with the young master! It's getting late!' They all went out, leaving only a petite and exquisite woman. The outside of the room was also quiet. I stood up to leave. At first, she looked at me with a lively expression, treating me like a prisoner. Later, seeing that my attitude was firm, she softened and said in a pleading tone, 'Thank you, do a good deed, stay here for one night and help me, so that they won't blame me for not being able to do business, for not being able to keep guests, and for having to suffer. It's like you lost three yuan in mahjong, please spend the night here!' Hearing her say this so pitifully, I gave her five yuan and fled this hell on earth like a fly.</p>
<p>When I came back and checked the ten-yuan bill in my coat, it was gone! I don't know if it was taken away by them or if it fell out when I was pushed and pulled. I didn't care about it. I just considered it the price of fifteen yuan for riding a flying sedan chair once."</p>
<p>I listened and thought silently, why does Shanghai, which claims to be civilized, tolerate these sedan chair carriers, openly on the street, pulling pedestrians to "ride flying sedan chairs" like kidnapping, without prohibiting it?</p>

<h3 id="e228">Sally Irene Painstakingly Makes "Remnants of Conduct" <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Since co-starring with James Dunn in the blockbusters "A Woman Rebels" and "Ann Vickers", Sally Irene has become a dazzling star. She recently starred in the blockbuster "Remnants of Conduct" which is the result of the actress' meticulous work. The film focuses on sincere emotion and action. The actress' acting skills have long left a deep impression on us. The film particularly highlights her unique talent. The performance of Spence, who plays a police officer, is quite good, and Albert Gran, who is very popular, repeatedly makes us laugh in the film, which is especially valuable. The film tells the story of a young police officer who is careful in his work and upright. He once refused a bribe from the leader of a liquor smuggling ring. One day, because of his beloved daughter, the leader demoted the young man and transferred him to another place. The young man was very depressed, so he secretly collected the unspoken rules of taverns and gambling dens. Later, the young man was detained for insulting a woman. At the same time, the private matter of soliciting money from the gambling dens was reported. The young man was ordered to search. The woman was being forced to be humiliated in the den, and a murder case occurred. The plot is tortuous and touching, and the portrayal of the darkness of unscrupulous merchants and the secret history of corrupt officials is infuriating. The film will be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting today.</p>
