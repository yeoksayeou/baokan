<h3 id="c1">國際間宣傳之重要翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>論者每謂今日之事。抵抗爲對外最有力之宣傳。其效用實勝於郵電之宣傳萬倍。試觀此次滬變。十九路軍奮力抵抗而後。國際輿論。頓然改觀。豈非明證。殊不知在此戰局相持未已之。中國際情勢。瞬息萬變。一着落後。全局俱非故宣傳一事。在今日實不容忽視。</p>
<p>政治史家薛鳥樸嘗言。［電訊之組織。始於一八五○年以後。。使政府在任何距離。外溝通消息於一刹那間。而措置裕如。其影響於外交者至鉅政府賴其消息靈通。指揮統一。外交官之任務。僅爲傳達之工具。］是則現代外交官之重視宣傳。已可概見。</p>
<p>彼日本於九一八之變即在外交上集中全副精神於電訊宣傳。一方面聯絡歐美記者。發爲不利於我之議論。他方面壟斷電訊。抺殺東北内部之眞相當事變之初。我施代表尙未得政府詳細之訓令。藉作對付張本。而日方早已將種種不眞確之事實。利用自有之電訊。拍達日内瓦。於是日代表振振有詞而我代表反默然無聲。迨一二八上海之變。我顏代表初以消息隔絶急電頻問。其情殊爲皇急。而日代表則又侃侃而談矣。日前雙方停戰四小時。俾慈善團體得往戰區救濟難民。日方即乘此機。拍電各國誣我在停戰期間違信開火。未聞有何辯正。最近日方電告國聯。謂已停戰。而實際尙在進攻。國聯信其言。以爲和平有望。頓然如釋重負。空氣立見和緩。是可見國際宣傳影響之鉅。又可見日方之宣傳着着爭先。而我方之宣傳着着落後也國際調查團抵東京。日政府與各界。又已極盡其宣傳之能事矣。將來調查團來滬。我國各方面對之又將如何</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Importance of International Publicity <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Commentators often say that today, resistance is the most effective form of external publicity. Its effect is far superior to postal and telegraphic publicity. Consider the recent Shanghai Incident. It was only after the Nineteenth Route Army fought valiantly that international public opinion suddenly changed. Isn't this clear evidence? However, during this ongoing conflict, the international situation changes rapidly. A single misstep can ruin the whole game. Publicity is absolutely indispensable today.</p>
<p>Political historian Sir Frederick Pollock once said, "The organization of telegraphs began after 1850, allowing governments to communicate news instantaneously at any distance and take appropriate measures. Its impact on diplomacy is enormous. Governments rely on its timely information for unified command. The task of diplomats is merely to convey information." This shows the importance modern diplomats place on publicity.</p>
<p>Japan, in the September 18th Incident, focused all its efforts on telegraphic publicity in diplomacy. On the one hand, it contacted European and American reporters to publish opinions unfavorable to us. On the other hand, it monopolized telecommunications, obliterating the true situation inside the Northeast. At the beginning of the incident, our representative, Mr. Shih, had not yet received detailed instructions from the government to prepare for a response. Meanwhile, the Japanese side had already used its own telecommunications to send all sorts of inaccurate facts to Geneva. As a result, the Japanese representative spoke eloquently, while our representative remained silent. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, our representative, Mr. Yan, was initially desperate due to the lack of information, sending frequent urgent telegrams. However, the Japanese representative was again able to speak eloquently. Recently, both sides agreed to a four-hour ceasefire to allow charitable organizations to rescue refugees in the war zone. The Japanese took this opportunity to telegraph various countries, falsely accusing us of violating the ceasefire by opening fire. No rebuttal was heard from our side. Recently, the Japanese telegraphed the League of Nations, claiming that they had ceased hostilities, but in reality, they were still advancing. The League of Nations believed them, thinking that peace was in sight and immediately felt relieved. The atmosphere immediately eased. This shows the significant impact of international publicity and also shows that the Japanese publicity efforts are always ahead of us, while our publicity efforts are always lagging behind. When the International Investigation Team arrives in Tokyo, the Japanese government and various sectors will exhaust all their publicity efforts. When the Investigation Team comes to Shanghai in the future, how will various aspects of our country respond?</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central Government Determined to Resist for the Long Term <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>All armed comrades shall persevere and coordinate. The Military Affairs Commission will establish a special chairman.</p>
<p>Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee Communiqué</p>
<p>Long-term resistance is the firm resolution; all hardships will be faced.</p>
<p>To all generals, including the heads of the Pacification Bureaus, commanders-in-chief, division and brigade commanders, and through them to all armed comrades: Japan is using its violence to invade and occupy the Northeast, extending to the Southeast. At this critical moment of survival, we have only one option besides surrendering to violence: active resistance. In the past, Yuan Shikai, due to surrendering to violence, signed the Twenty-One Demands, losing sovereignty and humiliating the nation, the consequences of which continue to this day. From this, it is clear that seeking peace through humiliation is counterproductive. We absolutely do not want to gamble the country's fate, but according to national history, a country that perishes through bloodshed can be revived, while a country that perishes without bloodshed will never be revived. Therefore, since September 18th of last year, we have repeatedly reminded our armed comrades throughout the country to take safeguarding against foreign aggression as their greatest duty. Recently, the Nineteenth Route Army in the Shanghai area, under orders to defend its territory, has fought with all its might, repeatedly repelling strong enemies. The Fifth Army, under orders to provide assistance, has fought alongside them. They have fought bitterly against the land, sea, and air forces of the brutal Japanese for over thirty days, inflicting excessive casualties. Although they have changed their positions due to strategic considerations, their elite troops have not been weakened. If all our armed comrades throughout the country can be as determined as the Nineteenth Route Army in defending their territory and as courageous as the Fifth Army in providing assistance, then the brutality of the Japanese, however rampant, will be contained. The central government is determined to resist for the long term and will not avoid any hardships. We hope that all our armed comrades throughout the country will heed this message. Treat the central government as hands and feet protect the head and eyes, and treat all localities as if their pain is our own. When the enemy's atmosphere arrives, immediately rise up to resist. When a call for troops is made, depart on schedule. Do not focus on defending territories or preserving strength. If all our armed comrades, numbering over a million, hold the common determination to live and die together and to persevere with violence, how can foreign aggression enter, and the nation will have a chance to revive. Let everyone strive for this. Seal of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<h3 id="e3">Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Reply to Kong Xiangxi's Telegram from Jiangxi</p>
<p>The government is determined to prepare for resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission will establish a chairman to oversee military orders.</p>
<p>Our army is changing strategies and temporarily withdrawing from Shanghai. Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi sent a telegram from Jiangxi to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, requesting that a comprehensive self-defense plan be quickly established to facilitate military operations. Yesterday, he received a reply from the plenary session, which stated, "To Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Honorable Sir: Confidential. We have received your telegram from Jiangxi, stating that since our army has retreated to the second line of defense, the people of Shanghai blame the government for lacking prior preparation and failing to provide timely reinforcements. Some say that during this military emergency, there should be a specialized commissioner responsible for leading the military affairs of the entire country. The people's激昂 sentiment is well understood, but all criticisms and the government's actual measures can be used for reference, but they often do not correspond to the facts. Since January, the government initially dispatched the Jiangsu and Zhejiang garrison troops to Shanghai, followed by the Henan and Jiangxi garrison troops, who proceeded day and night. However, the Japanese used maritime transport, while our army had to cross the river and travel on foot, so they could not be as fast. This is due to transportation issues and is extremely difficult to resolve. As for the preparation for resistance against Japan, the government is determined to resist for the long term. The frontline soldiers are also extremely brave. You, sir, are in Shanghai and can witness the facts, which can be explained. As for the fact that military orders are not centralized during this critical period, which is indeed inconvenient, the Second Plenary Session has decided to establish a chairman in the Military Affairs Commission to oversee military orders. We are informing you specifically and ask you to use various methods to explain this to all sectors to dispel misunderstandings. At this critical moment of survival, there is no faster method than for the entire country to be united, trust each other, and help each other. Your wisdom will surely understand this. The Second National Congress of the Fourth Central Executive Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Conversation with a Guest from Suzhou <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The situation at the front is very good.</p>
<p>Since our army withdrew from Zhabei, the situation at the front has been quite isolated. Now, Mr. Shi Hao, an assessor of Baoshan County, accompanied the army and traveled through Luodian, Jiading, and Kunshan before taking a military vehicle to Suzhou. Yesterday at noon, he arrived in Shanghai on a small transport and provided a faithful report of his experiences, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Baoshan Bombed <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shi has worked in Baoshan County for many years. During this conflict, he remained in the besieged city. When our army retreated to the second line of defense, Japanese planes bombed Baoshan County every day. On the 4th of this month, Baoshan County was hit by four bombs dropped by Japanese planes. Mr. Shi and more than ten staff members evacuated the county seat. Coincidentally, the troops of Weng Zhaoyuan's brigade, led by Tan Qixiu, withdrew from Wusong. Mr. Shi followed the army to Luodian, and Weng's brigade transferred to the front lines in Liuhe and other places. Mr. Shi and the refugees along the way went to Jiading.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Jiading Damaged <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>When Mr. Shi arrived in Jiading, he saw refugees filling the streets. The county seat of Jiading was bombed by Japanese planes, and the people were killed and injured, and the houses were burned everywhere. Mr. Shi originally intended to go to Taicang, but upon hearing that our army had retreated from the floating bridge and other places in Qiyakou, he turned back to Kunshan and then went to Suzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Suzhou is Safe <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Shi arrived in Kunshan, he boarded a military vehicle directly to Suzhou. After arriving in Suzhou, he learned that although Japanese planes had repeatedly scouted and dropped bombs in Suzhou, they were all in the open areas outside the city and there was no damage. Now, as more and more refugees from various places arrive in Suzhou, the market is more prosperous than usual. The rumors circulating outside are all false, and the people are quite calm.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Front Line is Stable <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shi stayed in Suzhou for a total of three days. During these three days, he personally witnessed our reinforcements heading to the front line in an endless stream. From the 5th to the 7th, a large number of fresh troops passed through Suzhou and headed to the front line. Those who arrived later stayed in Suzhou to await dispatch. Currently, our front line is in the area west of Nanxiang, and the second line of defense is guarding [missing characters].</p>

<p>The Combat Situation in Liuhe and Loutang</p>
<p>After our army withdrew from the first line of defense in Zhabei and Wusong due to strategic considerations, the focus of the war shifted to the areas of Huangdu, Jiading, and Taicang. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency took a steamer to Suzhou early yesterday morning and transferred to the front line for an on-the-spot inspection. The various news obtained yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Recent Defense Line of the Japanese Army <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army, which has been continuously reinforced by land troops arriving in Shanghai, has completely handed over the rear defense to the marines after our army withdrew from the first line of defense in Zhabei and Wusong. Most of the land troops are still advancing towards our second line of defense. The headquarters of the 9th Regiment is located in the Li Gong Temple in Nanxiang. From there to the north, the front line reaches the north of Jiading. All of them are digging trenches and deploying defenses by the 9th Division of the Japanese Army. Their light and heavy artillery (including six large cannons and small steel cannons) are arranged about one kilometer away from the infantry line to form artillery positions to cover the infantry's attack on us. The artillery headquarters is located in Zhenru and Jinan University. Jiading to Liuhe is uniformly defended by the 11th Division. Commander Shirakawa, although stationed in the Jinan University headquarters, must inspect the defense line once a day by car. The most advanced Japanese army in Huangdu is located in Yang'erbang and Lujiabang, facing our army across the Lou River. They have made several attempts to cross the river, but all have failed. In Baimaokou and Liuhezhen, northwest of Liuhe, the Japanese have deployed heavy artillery to fire large cannons from time to time to cover the landing of Japanese troops to attack our positions. In the waters of Fuqiaozhen and Qiyakou, more than 20 Japanese warships, large and small, are gathered, arranged in a T-shape, fully loaded with land troops, waiting for an opportunity to land, hoping to connect with the Japanese troops in Baimaokou and Liuhezhen. Moreover, on the morning of the 6th, the Japanese also brought an aircraft carrier to Baimaokou, carrying seven airplanes, intending to bomb Wuxi and Changzhou. In total, the recent Japanese line, starting from Nanxiang, has more than 100,000 troops to the front line. There are approximately 300 large and small heavy cannons. The exact number of airplanes is difficult to ascertain for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Course of the Fierce Battles <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(1) Liuhe Area: When Weng Zhaoyuan's brigade, which was defending the Wusong Fort, withdrew to Yuepu and Liuhe at 5 p.m. on the 3rd, more than 10,000 Japanese troops were engaged in a fierce battle with the troops stationed there. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. At the same time, more than ten Japanese aircraft randomly dropped bombs on our army's positions. At this time, most of Weng's brigade had arrived there and, without resting, immediately surrounded and attacked the left and right wings of the Japanese army, catching them by surprise, like a flying general descending from the sky. The Japanese army was shocked and hastily fought back on all sides. Our army then ordered a charge and engaged in hand-to-hand combat for about an hour. The enemy troops were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed, fleeing to the warships. The rest retreated towards Qianjing. In this battle, many enemies were killed, and eight cannons, more than 20 machine guns, and more than 1,000 rifles were captured. According to another report, on the morning of the 3rd, in the waters of Fuqiaozhen and Qiyakou, more than 20 Japanese warships loaded with more than 10,000 Japanese troops landed there under the cover of artillery fire, concentrated their forces, and launched a fierce attack on our positions. Our army also returned fire with artillery. At about 11 a.m., a Japanese flagship was hit by our artillery fire, destroying one of its funnels and killing more than 100 enemies who had not yet landed. Our army then took the opportunity to rush out of the trenches. The enemy also used tanks to cover the infantry and fiercely resisted. The two sides got closer and closer, and the artillery fire lost its effectiveness. Our army then ordered the Liyang Volunteer Corps' broadsword teams to charge into the enemy's ranks, where they swept everything before them. The infantry also successively mounted bayonets and charged forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. By 5 p.m., many Japanese troops had been killed by our army's broadswords and bayonets. Corpses littered the field, and blood flowed like a river. At this time, Weng Zhaoyuan's brigade also retreated from Wusong to this place and immediately joined the attack, making the enemy troops feel even more unable to resist, and they collapsed. (2) Loutang Town: At 6 a.m. on the 3rd, more than 7,000 Japanese troops advanced on our defensive line in two directions. Our army calmly responded to the battle. The artillery fire from both sides was very fierce. The fierce battle continued until 12:30 a.m. Our side, with reinforcements having arrived, divided into four directions and launched a close encirclement of the Japanese army from the front, rear, left, and right. The rivers are winding, and the houses are adjacent to each other. Although the Japanese army had sharp weapons such as tanks and armored vehicles, they were useless. As a result, five of them were captured by our army (two of them have been destroyed by our artillery fire), and countless spoils of war were seized.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Conversation with Brigade Commander Weng <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter met with Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan at his military headquarters and asked about the withdrawal from Wusong and the enemy annihilation in Liuhe. He replied as follows: I (Weng himself said) received Commander Cai's retreat order on the evening of the 1st. I had vowed to shed the last drop of blood on the Wusong Fort. Not only I personally, but also the soldiers, had the same idea and were willing to coexist and die with the fort. Therefore, although there was an order from Commander Cai at the time, I was still unwilling to retreat. At this time, our army only had [missing characters] Brigade with more than 3,000 people, the Iron Blood Army with more than 400 people, and the militia with more than 100 people, totaling less than 4,000 people. The Japanese army, with ten times the number, surrounded and attacked us from the sea, land, and air. Although our soldiers knew that there was no way to resist, they could still fight bravely, one against a hundred. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy still failed to succeed. The stalemate continued until the morning of the 2nd, when he received another telegram from Commander Cai, urging the retreat. At the same time, a representative from Shanghai was also sent to request that Wusong be withdrawn in accordance with the original strategy to preserve strength and then slowly seek a counterattack. I had no choice but to issue a retreat order. Beforehand, he ambushed heavy troops southeast of Tongji University to prevent the Japanese army from taking the opportunity to pursue. After the deployment was properly arranged, he began to withdraw to Liuhe and Yuepu at 9 a.m. on the 3rd. At the same time, he ordered the frontline soldiers to continue fighting the Japanese army. When the retreat had reached a considerable extent, the frontline soldiers were ordered to move backwards. However, at this time, the Japanese army was afraid that our side was using a trick and did not dare to step into Wusong Fort for two hours. At about 1 p.m., the Japanese army began to land successively and divided a part of their troops to pursue and attack our army. When they pursued to Tongji University, our ambushed troops came out together to intercept them. The enemy army was shocked and collapsed. Our army retreated leisurely. At about 5 p.m., most of them had retreated to the vicinity of Liuhe. At that time, 10,000 enemy troops were engaged in a fierce battle with our army. I ordered the entire army to divide into left and right wings and surround the enemy army, catching them by surprise. The enemy army was shocked and could not withstand the attack. Our army pursued and killed them with great strength. In this battle, it was confirmed that more than 7,000 enemy troops were killed. In short, our army's retreat to the second line of defense this time was not a retreat due to defeat, but because of strategic relations, we had to shorten the front line, concentrate our forces, and then plan a counterattack. Now, all the armed comrades on the front line, from the commander to the soldiers, all hold the determination of [the enemy will die if I am here, I will die if the enemy is here]. I only hope that all the people will still maintain their original intentions and provide various conveniences to the military, and that the whole country will be united to fight against the enemy. Then the final victory will be assured.</p>
<h3 id="e13">No Major Battles on the Entire Front Yesterday <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Our army's commander-in-chief, Chiang Kuang-nai, in order to respect international advice and the ceasefire resolution between the two sides, ordered all soldiers the day before yesterday that if the Japanese army did not attack, we would not attack either. Yesterday, the enemy army did not dare to risk violating the order and launching a fierce attack on us, so we did not attack either. Although gunfire could be heard on the entire front, it was sporadic and there were no major battles.</p>
<p>A telegram from Suzhou on the 7th stated that the front line was quiet on the 7th, and Kunshan had decided to open the market on the 8th. The 19th Army appointed Chen Xinlu as the director of the Suzhou Office.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Loutang Devastated <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Another report: The reporter's family has lived in Loutang Town, Jiading, for generations. This time, when our army withdrew completely, the enemy troops pursued westward, and Loutang happened to be in the line of fire. The reporter returned to Lou on the morning of the 2nd to receive his family out of danger. On the way through Jiangqiao, he still saw our army heading west in an endless stream. When he arrived in Nanxiang, the telephone connection between Loutang and Nanxiang had been cut off. He detoured to Malu, where the phone to Loutang could still be reached directly. It was said that many of our troops were still stationed in Loutang, urging the reporter to come to Lou as soon as possible to discuss everything. At noon, he arrived in Loutang. At that time, nine enemy planes had already flown to the area to drop bombs. The reporter personally saw that the residence of Lou gentleman Yin Xizhang, the residence of Chen Jiwen, the Yang family hotel, the store of Qu Zishan, and Meibucun were all destroyed by bombs. Residents were fleeing for their lives, and the order was greatly disrupted. By 2:00 p.m., nine out of ten houses in Loutang were empty. The reporter, with his family, managed to escape in the sound of bombs. That night, he stayed in a village a few miles away from Lou. At night, he heard dense machine-gun fire from Loutang, indicating that the enemy army had pursued to Lou and set fire to the central elementary school in the town. The reporter escaped from danger to Shanghai on the 3rd, following the original route.</p>

<p>About four or five hours after our army withdrew west from Nanxiang to Huangdu on the 4th, enemy cavalry swarmed along the Jinghu Road and immediately occupied the residents' houses to rest. Part of them continued to open to the north to Malu. On the evening of the new military road, the Japanese army's transport vehicles were endless, looking like countless stars in the sky from a distance. At dawn the next day, they searched in all directions but did not advance. At about 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, suddenly more than ten Japanese cavalry rushed into Huangdu Station. When they were near Lujia Village, they were spotted by the troops stationed at our station, who immediately fired to resist. Before long, the Japanese troops retreated to Nanxiang. By the morning of the 6th, there were as many as 30,000 Japanese troops concentrated in Nanxiang, digging trenches in a hurry. On one side, they sent troops to advance to the northwest. Two hours later, the rumbling of artillery fire could be heard from a distance, suggesting their intention to attack our army in Huangdu, Fangtai, and Yanhe. Now, the houses that were bombed in Nanxiang Town include Rihua Xuan, Baziqiao, and Shizuo.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Japanese army had entered Huangdu Town after bombarding it for several hours starting at 2 a.m. yesterday (the 6th). The entire front line from Liuhe to Jiading, Zhengyi, and Nanxiang is quiet, except for the occasional sound of rifles, machine guns, and artillery. It is reported that Japanese merchant ships and warships are still continuously carrying small batches of reinforcements, who are landing and heading to the Zhabei and Jiangwan districts. Although the Japanese commander ordered the cessation of hostile actions on March 3, the Japanese army is still advancing. After occupying Huangdu yesterday morning (not confirmed by officials), they attacked Anting Town, the gateway to Kunshan, all day long.</p>

<p>The Changshu Fellow Association sent a telegram to Luoyang: To Chairman Lin of the National Government and President Wang: The brutal Japanese are invading Shanghai. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army and Fifth Army have fought bloody battles for more than a month, repeatedly repelling the enemy's attacks. Later, the enemy increased their troops by 100,000, and our unsupported and isolated army had to retreat to the rear defense, resulting in the loss of Shanghai and the opening of the gateway. Our beautiful rivers and mountains will fall into the hands of foreign races. You, as officials who harm the people and mislead the country, are cutting yourselves off from the people. You should immediately send a large army to recover the lost territory and clear out the enemy soldiers within a time limit to dispel doubts and seek redemption. The telegram is filled with grief, blood, and tears. The President of the Changshu Fellow Association in Shanghai, Cao Zhenqing, and others respectfully bow.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Danyang Fellow Association <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Danyang Fellow Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to Gu Zhutong: Urgent. To Chairman Gu Zhutong of Zhenjiang: The Shanghai disaster occurred suddenly and has lasted for more than a month. At first, the Nineteenth Route Army bravely bore the brunt of the attack. Then, the Fifth Army joined the fight with common hatred. However, due to lack of support, they temporarily withdrew from Shanghai and Wusong. However, as our army reached the second line of defense, the Japanese invaders followed and attacked Jiading, Taicang, and Kunshan. The situation is urgent. The invaders are going deep. If we sit idly by and watch the loyal and brave isolated army without strong reinforcements, then Jiangsu Province will inevitably be entirely occupied by the enemy, and the national government will also suffer a painful collapse. You are a person of Jiangsu and have a duty to defend the territory and protect your hometown. We believe you cannot bear to see the entire province of Jiangsu fall into the hands of the enemy or allow 30 million people to become slaves of a lost country from which there is no return. We implore you to telegraph the central government to quickly send a large number of reinforcements to fight the enemy with all our strength, recover the territory of Jiangsu, and consolidate national defense. Not only will your fame and reputation shock China and foreign countries, but we people of Jiangsu will also cast your statue in gold in the scenic area of Jingkou to honor and reward you. We respectfully make our appeal with tears, feeling extremely urgent. Danyang Fellow Association bows.</p>

<p>The Chaozhou Fellow Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to Luoyang: To the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang: The brutal Japanese are invading Shanghai. Our Nineteenth Route Army has fought hard for more than a month. Except for the Fifth Army voluntarily joining the battle, the government has not sent a single soldier to help, resulting in the loss of Liuhe due to the lack of troops to defend it. The enemy landed stealthily and surrounded our rear, forcing us to withdraw completely. This is truly tragic. The government leaders have repeatedly announced to the people of the country that they are determined to resist to the end and recover the lost territory. The important ports and prosperous markets of Shanghai and Songhu have fallen into the hands of the Japanese, causing the residents of the city to be burned, killed, and ravaged. The people are indignant. Please immediately dispatch a large army to reinforce and recover the lost territory in order to save the survival of the Chinese nation. We respectfully make our appeal, urgently awaiting orders. The Patriotic Committee of the Chaozhou Fellow Association in Shanghai bows.</p>

<p>The United Association of Guangdong People in Shanghai sent a telegram to Luoyang: To the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang and the members of the various ministries and commissions of the National Government: Since the brutal Japanese invaded the Northeast and then attacked Shanghai with the forces of the entire country, fortunately, our soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army have been loyal and brave in defending the country. They have fought bloody battles for more than a month, repeatedly repelling the strong enemy. However, due to the lack of support for the isolated army, they were forced to retreat. This is extremely painful. Our central government has repeatedly announced to the people of the country that it is determined to resist to the end and recover the lost territory. The important ports and prosperous markets of Shanghai and Songhu have fallen into the hands of the Japanese, causing the residents of the city to be burned, killed, and ravaged.

<p>Yesterday, the Jianghuai Fellow Association telegraphed the central government in Luoyang, requesting that it quickly send reinforcements so that the Nineteenth Route Army could quickly recover Zhabei and carry out its patriotic determination to resist Japan. The telegram was very long, and its poignant sentences were: [This army is not an army of national demise, and our people are not people of national demise. If the Republic of China suffers the tragedy of national demise due to lack of support and the fall of Shanghai, who caused it? Who will take responsibility?]. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association, which is affiliated with the offices of various fellow associations in Shanghai, held its third joint meeting. The Jianghuai Fellow Association still plans to make a more urgent proposal for requesting assistance.</p>

Our 19th Route Army is resisting and defending for more than a month. Apart from the 5th Army voluntarily coming to Shanghai, the government is only paying lip service to resistance, deceiving our people, and has not increased troops. The military departments only hear of procuring military rice for Japanese warships, but for our army, no supply stations are set up, and supplies of arms and ammunition are insufficient. The air force is hidden, and the navy disappears, allowing the isolated army to lose support. Your dereliction of duty and harming the country are unforgivable. Furthermore, we hear that the Military Affairs Commission has approved an increase of five divisions to aid Shanghai, but you have been delaying and refusing to dispatch them. What are your intentions? What secret orders have you received? Please clearly declare to the people to dispel their anxieties.

<h3 id="e24">Sichuan Native Place Association <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai recently sent a telegram to Sichuan military generals, saying: "Respectfully to Liu Pucheng, Supervisor of Chongqing; Liu Zigan, Chairman of Chengdu; Deng Jinkang, Commander-in-Chief; Tian Songyao, Military Governor of Tongchuan; Yang Zihui, Commander of Guang'an; and Liu Jizhi, Supervisor of Huanding. After our Jiang telegram last month, we received your replies and circular telegrams, all stating that you were ready for battle and would immediately come to aid. Subsequently, reading Sichuan newspapers, we learned that the Central Government had issued a clear order, instructing you to send six divisions to Wuhan to respond to all sides. More than a month has passed, yet we still have not seen you dispatch a single soldier from Sichuan. Like a critically ill person hoping for you to save their life, that person is probably reduced to ashes. Could it be that your so-called 'ready for battle' is actually just lying down and sleeping, forgetting the Central Government's orders? However, the earth-shattering sound of the fall of Shanghai should have awakened you. Or, is there something you don't understand? According to reports from various county-level mass organizations in Sichuan, you are raising funds and pre-collecting grain taxes from the people in the name of sending troops to aid Shanghai. In that case, you clearly have not forgotten the Central Government's orders, and you are already putting them into action. Why do you sit idly by and watch Shanghai fall, still engaging in armchair strategy, refusing to turn the 'ready for battle' in your telegrams into actually taking up arms and fighting? Is it possible that even today, you are still like the so-called 'expedition to the north' and 'suppression of the communists' in the past, using troop dispatch as a facade and fund-raising as the real goal? Do you not know that even though Jews are wealthy, they ultimately cannot escape the name of being slaves of a lost nation? Encourage yourselves, gentlemen, you can wake up now! Shanghai has fallen, Kunshan and Suzhou are in danger. If this continues, the country will be finished! This is the time for you to send troops! Attacking from a sitting position is a shameful thing to say! The Japanese have only 250,000 soldiers, yet they dare to rampage through China. You have 300,000 soldiers, yet you cannot defend your country. They are soldiers, and you are also soldiers. If soldiers dare not resist soldiers, even if you do not fear the ridicule of soldiers, your personal integrity will be completely swept away. But considering the military's duty, shouldn't you be ashamed to die? Alas, traveling from Chongqing to Shanghai only takes a week. Preparations have been made for more than a month. Why are you still arriving so late? If you still have the heart to save the country, you should join hands and march together immediately to aid Shanghai. The Chongqing army must not obstruct the Chengdu army's passage for no reason, and the Chengdu army must not use this as an excuse to attack the Chongqing army. Even if you cannot trust each other, do the people have no public opinion? If you can break through this petty mentality, why do you need to hold meetings here and meetings there, delaying and hesitating, claiming there are no combat orders? You must know that killing the enemy for the country is the duty of a soldier, and you do not need to wait for orders. We do not believe that if you can recover Shanghai, you will be punished by the government. If you are so concerned about this, then let us ask you, in the past, when you slaughtered each other, did you ever have orders from the Central Government or worry about military expenses? Please look at the 19th Route Army's operations this time. Without raising funds, funds gathered by themselves. Without asking for food and fodder, food and fodder were inexhaustible. If you can fight against the Japanese, the people of all places will surely support you in the same way, so you don't need to send troops to extort them. The national crisis is as urgent as fire! Our loyal words end here. Whether you become ghosts or humans is up to you to choose. If China perishes because of you cowards who refuse to fight, we will not pursue any praise or criticism of you in the future. Our association hereby, on behalf of 70 million compatriots, declares that we will not allow you to escape to the ends of the earth. Our words are filled with sorrow and indignation, our tears flowing with the telegram. We do not expect a reply, but we hope for the arrival of your troops. The Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai bows in reverence."</p>
<p>Telegram of Condolence to the 19th and 5th Armies</p>
<h3 id="e25">Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang issued a telegram of condolence to the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army on the 6th, saying: "To Commander-in-Chief Jiang Jingran, Army Commander Cai Xianchu, Army Commander Zhang Wenbo, Commander Dai Xiaokun, and all division, brigade, and regimental commanders and all armed comrades of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, At 3:00 p.m. today, during the plenary session, we received and read the telegram from Shanghai. We were deeply moved and saddened. This time, our armed comrades, in the Shanghai area, are resisting the violent and protecting the territory, which has a very profound impact on the country and the nation. On September 18th of last year, the Northeast Border Defense Army lost the land of two provinces within 24 hours due to non-resistance. Now, due to resistance, Shanghai, a corner of the country, has persisted for more than 30 days. If every part of the country was like this, and everyone was like this, how could Japanese violence succeed? The 19th Route Army took the lead, and the 5th Army followed closely behind. Not a day passed without being in the midst of gunfire. The blood shed by the officers and soldiers of the two armies is united, making the strong neighbor's trick of sowing discord useless, and the speculators' manipulations useless. This highest manifestation of sincere unity is especially worthy of being a model for comrades in arms, and the foundation for protecting the country and preserving the race is also laid here. This time, Japan is using unequal treaties as a shield, warships are rushing up and down the Yangtze River, and the Public Concession is used as a landing point and base for the army. As a result, a large number of troops are continuously transported, without any hindrance. On our side, due to inadequate transportation, when the 19th Route Army was fighting hard, the 5th Army was stationed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but still managed to rush to aid. The remaining troops in other places are still on long journeys. As a result, the disparity between the number of troops is huge, and our loyal and brave officers and soldiers have to make a strategic retreat. This is sincerely what the comrades of the Central Committee feel sorry about and deeply wish to follow the weak points and urgently seek remedies. Today's events are not just about temporary advances and retreats, and are not related to the war situation. We have already made the greatest determination to fight for a long time, so victory is not enough to celebrate, and defeat is not enough to grieve. We only know that sacrifice is the price of national rejuvenation. We wish to encourage ourselves with this, and also to comfort our loyal and brave officers and soldiers. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Ma."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association telegraphed, "Respectfully to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Army Commander Cai, Commander Dai, and all officers and soldiers. After the violent Japanese barbarously occupied our Northeast, they invaded our Southeast. You bravely resisted and fought bloodily for a month. You repeatedly defeated the enemy in Zhabei and Jiangwan, truly winning back the personality of our nation. The international atmosphere has changed as a result. If you had received aid from several divisions earlier, it would not have been difficult to drive the enemy out of our borders and achieve a complete victory. How could the enemy repeatedly add troops, using twice the strength to pressure you from the front and back, forcing you to make strategic retreats? Who caused this? It is truly hateful. Fortunately, you have been able to use iron and blood to lead the people. The people's hearts have not died, and they will surely rise up to kill the enemy. Any sacrifice is not enough to regret. Recently, merchants and people at home and abroad have been enthusiastically donating, and various organizations have been requesting reinforcements, which is a general indication. The country raises more than 2 million soldiers, but once a strong enemy attacks, the Northeast is lost due to non-resistance, and this time we are retreating due to lack of aid. It cannot but pain the hearts of the people. We only hope that you will carry out your original intentions, invigorate your spirits, and fight for a long time. Relying on the spirits of our ancestors in heaven and the united support of the people, the victory in the last five minutes will surely belong to our army. We hereby send a telegram of condolence, hoping for your understanding. Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association, Yu."</p>

<p>The China Self-Strengthening Association telegraphed, "Respectfully to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Army Commander Cai, Army Commander Zhang, Commander Dai, and all officers and soldiers. The Japanese warlords, in order to implement their policy of aggression, have already occupied our East Province and are now attacking our Shanghai. Your department is for legitimate defense, severely punishing them. You have fought hard for more than a month, achieving great achievements in the world, and repeatedly defeating strong enemies, spreading your prestige to various countries. The Northeast authorities, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, were afraid and avoided fighting. The difference between their virtue and wickedness is clear. All Chinese people admire you. We were hoping to annihilate those fierce and stubborn enemies and secure our rivers and mountains, but unexpectedly the isolated army was cut off from aid and abandoned its previous achievements. After reading the various telegrams yesterday, we were deeply indignant. However, because of the strategic concerns, it does not hinder the final victory. We still hope that you will continue to fight hard to achieve your original intentions. Our association members pledge to do our best to awaken the masses and jointly plan to resist the invaders. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to quickly dispatch a large army to help recover the lost land, we hereby send a telegram of condolence, hoping for your understanding. Li Guomo and others of the China Self-Strengthening Association bow in reverence, Yang."</p>
<h3 id="e28">Guangdong Army慰劳Delegation Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday P]　　Will Leave Shanghai Today to Go to the Front After the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, our 19th Route Army resisted with great effort, and various groups from all walks of life across the country sent letters and telegrams to express their condolences and donated generously. The Guangdong representatives who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday included Zhou Zhi, Chen Xiang, Li Boyan, and Wang Hongzhao representing the headquarters; Zhang Haodong and Zhang Zeshen representing the First Army; He Yi and Yang Guogen representing the Second Army; Liu Zhongwen, Chen Guanghan, and Yang Jianmin representing the Third Army; Yang Diping and Shao Weichen representing the Instructor Division; and Xu Zhixian representing the Military Academy. It is heard that they will take a ship from Shanghai to Jiangsu today and then go to the front to comfort the 19th Route Army. Zhang Zhaorong, a councilor of Cai Tingkai, was previously ordered to go to Guangdong to discuss official business. It is heard that Mr. Zhang also came to Shanghai with the delegation yesterday, according to Da Mei Evening News. The Da Mei Evening News article about the battleground today is so sad and shocking. The Da Mei Evening News reported that their reporter visited several parts of the war zone in the countryside for a week yesterday. They saw no fewer than thousands of Chinese corpses exposed in the fields, unburied. Although most of them were soldiers, there were also many civilians. Furthermore, in the remaining houses after the fire, they often saw the charred remains of women and children, which were unbearable to witness. The Japanese corpses had been quickly removed by the Japanese soldiers, but the Chinese corpses, except for the main areas such as the surroundings of Jiangwan Station, were apparently still unattended. Beside a Buddha statue in the Guangdong Cemetery, there was the corpse of an elderly farmer woman, whose face was blurred and limbs broken. Her thighs were exposed, and the flesh showed that she had been stabbed violently. Several foreigners had seen this, and there were even worse and more tragic cases. For the sake of providing evidence, photos have been taken. The reporter especially inspected a corpse said to have been nailed and burned. They saw the corpse lying on a nail board, but later saw that the nails were hammered in from the back of the wooden board, which might be because the house collapsed after the person died, and the corpse happened to touch the nail board. Most of Jiangwan, Dachang, and Zhenru have been destroyed. The broken tiles and collapsed walls are endless, seemingly mostly the result of aerial bombardment. Dachang is the worst of the three. Near Dachang, there were several damaged Red Cross trucks, apparently destroyed by artillery shells or airplane bombs. Japanese soldiers and civilians were looking for war souvenirs in this devastated area. Soldiers taking photos often stood on Chinese corpses, holding the Rising Sun Flag and grinning. Sometimes they would take unexploded artillery shells, place them on the corpses, and take photos. Japanese civilians, carrying their families, strolled around in the meantime, with many children in tow, talking and laughing along the way, as if they were on vacation. Although the Japanese authorities were unwilling to issue passes to foreigners who wanted to go to the war zone, there were quite a few foreigners who managed to get to the war zone. However, when they passed the Japanese naval headquarters on North Sichuan Road on the way back, they were all stopped by Japanese soldiers, who ordered them to get out of the car and searched the car. Zhabei 代行警權 工部局並未通過决議案 The 工部局 has not passed a resolution to代行警權 in Zhabei. A news report said that the 工部局 held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month to discuss the security issues in Zhabei, and resolved that if Mayor Wu expressed his opinion and voluntarily requested the 工部局 to maintain security on his behalf, the 工部局 would take over the police powers. This news is inconsistent with the facts. The 工部局 did not hold a special meeting on the issue of guarding Zhabei. The 工部局 board of directors has recently been holding meetings every day. At one of the meetings, someone mentioned the worrying health conditions in Zhabei, because the area is adjacent to the concession, and there may be a risk of infection. At the meeting, it was believed that if the Chinese side requested assistance in this matter, the bureau could consider providing assistance. Then someone talked about the police problem in Zhabei. After the participants exchanged opinions, they believed that the 工部局 did not have any jurisdiction in Zhabei, so unless the Shanghai Mayor specially requested it, the 工部局 could not do anything. All the participants were very clear about this. In short, the 工部局 has not passed any resolutions on guarding Zhabei, and only had an informal discussion on this issue at one of the meetings. The intention was only that if the Chinese side requested assistance, the bureau should be prepared in advance. Wang BinYan Refuses to Organize a Chinese Police Force in Zhabei. The 大陆报 reports that Wang BinYan, the former head of the Zhabei Jiangwan Security Corps, was invited by the Japanese authorities yesterday (the 6th) to organize a Chinese police force in Zhabei, which would be controlled by Japanese officers. This move by the Japanese authorities is probably an attempt to implement their usual tricks in the three northeastern provinces and try to organize a puppet government in Shanghai. In the three northeastern provinces, the Japanese first asked local gentry to organize a local police force, which was controlled by Japanese officers, and then took further steps to establish a local government, which eventually became their so-called national government. It is heard that Mr. Wang's friends have already asked him to study the history of the puppet government in the three northeastern provinces last night and refuse this invitation. According to the latest news, Mr. Wang has refused this invitation. It is now believed that the Japanese authorities will try this invitation on others. Wang BinYan told the 新声社 reporter yesterday that he has been the head of the Zhabei Security Corps for many years, and there are currently more than a thousand members. The news report that there are only more than two hundred members proves that it does not understand the truth about the Zhabei Security Corps. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai incident, he has personally led his subordinates, not hesitating to work hard and avoid dangers, to help the rear guard, maintain local order, and work hard in rescue, burial, fire protection, and construction of defense works, and provide supplies to small workers. Day and night, he has never left the corps for a moment. Until about 2:00 a.m. on the 2nd of this month, after the 19th Route Army retreated with its entire army to change its strategy, the corps saw that the military and police had retreated one after another. In order to protect the military equipment and avoid being confiscated by the enemy, it had no choice but to lead the team to Caohejing at about 11:00 a.m. The corps is under the command of the municipal government. If it wants to return to Zhabei to maintain security, it will obey the orders of the municipal government. The news report that he had a conversation with the Japanese is completely fabricated. The news of organizing a Chinese police force is probably a common trick of the Japanese to sow discord. He has been a vegetarian for <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>(Two) Years, and he has no intention of becoming an official. In addition to always working tirelessly and diligently in local charitable causes, he has never advised on politics. Wang is confident that he still has integrity, and he will never be willing to be like people like Xi Qia and Yuan Jinkai. The Japanese Army Continues to Reinforce. More Than Two Thousand Soldiers Transported from Dalian. After our army retreated to the second line of defense, the Japanese soldiers continued to advance westward, and even increased their reinforcements to Shanghai to strengthen their occupied areas. The Japanese troops that continue to arrive will be reported as follows. Honjo Sends Troops to Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Honjo Shigeru, the commander of the Japanese army in Northeast China, dispatched a division and transported it to Shanghai from Dalian. The two 10,000-ton giant ships, Harbin Maru and Fuzaki Maru (transliteration), were used to transport them to Shanghai. The first batch of Japanese soldiers from outside the pass and a large amount of military equipment have arrived in Shanghai, with approximately 2,000 soldiers. They were unloaded in Shanghai yesterday, and the Harbin Maru immediately rushed back to Dalian to prepare to load the second batch of soldiers to Shanghai. More Japanese Soldiers Arrive. In the past two days, approximately 1,000 soldiers from Shirakawa's 14th Division were also transferred, using transport ships such as Asu Maru, Shik Maru, and Noborikawa to transport them to Shanghai. There were a total of 4,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and a large number of military horses. There was also a lot of military equipment that came with them. Yesterday, they arrived at the Huangpu River and landed at the Huangpu, Huishan, Osaka and other docks in the Yangshupu area. Some of these newly arrived Japanese soldiers were transferred to Zhenru, Nanxiang and other places yesterday to replace the Japanese soldiers on the front line to rest. [ ] There are now at least 80,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai, Zhenru, Nanxiang, Jiading, and Liuhe. The daily demand for military food and military supplies is very large. Yesterday, another special service ship, fully loaded with military equipment, military supplies, and food, arrived in Shanghai and unloaded at the Huishan Wharf in the afternoon. Representatives of the International Red Cross Arrive in Shanghai. To Investigate the Japanese Army's Killing of Chinese Red Cross Staff and the Use of Dum Dum Bullets. The International Red Cross has specially sent Secretary-General Dr. Borlang to Shanghai to investigate. He arrived in Shanghai on the 6th and is staying at Room 502 of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. He immediately went to 26 Jiujiang Road to meet with Mr. Wang Peiyuan, the chairman of the Chinese Red Cross, to inquire about everything. Wang immediately reported that three Chinese Red Cross staff members had been shot and killed by the Japanese army, two had died from serious injuries, and four were missing. Dachang field hospital was destroyed, and dozens of people, including Wang Zhifang and Wang Dunfu, were slightly injured. Borlang was deeply shocked and decided to go to various field hospitals with Mr. Wang Peiyuan today (8th) to inspect everything. At 12:00 noon, Wang held a banquet at the Xinya Restaurant, inviting health professionals to accompany him to welcome him. Rescue Work. The Shanghai International Merchant Corps Rescues Wounded Civilians. The 大陆报 reports that the Chinese Red Cross learned yesterday that there were still many wounded Chinese people in the Jiangwan area, groaning and waiting to die. Various Chinese charitable organizations negotiated with the Japanese authorities to allow them to go to rescue them, but all efforts were unsuccessful. Yesterday, they negotiated with the Shanghai International Merchant Corps Red Cross to take on this task on their behalf. The corps has decided to send four Red Cross vehicles to the war zone to search for and rescue them. Shengzi Rice Shop Sells Rice at a Discount. The Japanese Invade Shanghai, and the Needy People in Zhabei and Jiangwan Flee to the Concessions. Recently, Baoshan, Taicang, and other places have also come south, resulting in an increase in the consumption of rice in Shanghai, and the poor people have difficulty eating. Shengzi rice shops in this city, such as Hongsheng on Zhili Road, Hesheng on Sanmaoge Bridge, and Hengxingsheng north of Laozha Bridge, have prepared a large amount of small-sized indica rice for the sake of helping civilians obtain food, and will sell it at a discount from today. In particular, they will give priority to retail buyers. Donating Money to Help Wounded Civilians is Praiseworthy. Mr. Chen Cangfan, who works in a certain agency, donated six yuan to his colleague Cao Huimin, considering the difficulty of providing for the wounded soldiers. Mi Shida, Yang Xi Mao, Chen Hongjun, Wu Zhensheng, Zhang Cheng, Chen Changfan, Wu Shanxing, Lin Wenzhao, and Yu Fengchun donated five yuan each. Yuan Cunde donated three yuan. Li Ruixing, Fu Shunnan, Jiang Xunfu, Xu Songxian, and Jiang Xiasheng donated two yuan each. Wang Xufa, Hu Hongxing, Yin Genrong, Zeng Xiancai, Xue Cailin, Xu Rongbing, and Yu Sisi donated one yuan each. Zhu Zhenbang donated 3.5 jiao, for a total of 71.35 yuan. In addition, Kong Qingyong of the Datong Hotel in Huangshigang raised four yuan from Xu Yangshi, and Chen Cai, Xu Jiewan, and Wu Xinliang donated two yuan each. Ma Zhao Shi, Zhu Liu Shi, Wang Guisheng, Huang Jiaoqing, Deng Yuanfa, Xu Younong, and Shang Chunju donated one yuan each. Hu Lianjiang, Chen Jinhua, and Che Yongqing jointly donated 1.1 yuan, for a total of 18.1 yuan. A total of 89.45 yuan was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Erma Road to be used as a recuperation fee for the wounded soldiers, in order to awaken the compatriots to follow suit and help each other. The Rescue Association Goes to Jiangsu to Rescue Refugees. The Refugee Relief Association, co-organized by the Christian Youth Association, has been unable to go to various places to rescue them due to the obstruction of the Japanese army. Therefore, they have only sent people to guard the area between Bailinan Road and Zhongshan Road in recent days. When they see someone escaping, they will guide and take them in. The association has now decided to send personnel to Jiangsu tomorrow to directly reach the war zone and provide on-site rescue and comfort. Message. French Sailors Console Wounded Soldiers. French Concession, Zhen Dan University on Luban Road, the 28th Wounded Soldiers Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross, suddenly a French sailor came on the afternoon of yesterday to comfort our loyal and brave soldiers. Guided by the medical students of the school, the sailor briefly comforted each of the wounded soldiers and shook hands with them to pay his respects. Before leaving, he took out one silver dollar to reward them and express his enthusiasm. The hospital issued a receipt, and when asked for his name, he refused to answer and left. Chaozhou Fellow Countrymen Console Wounded Soldiers. The Chaozhou Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai comforted the 33rd Wounded Soldiers Hospital in the Chaozhou Hui Poor Children's Education Institute today, and each person was given a set of flannel shirts and pants. The public office also donated 500 yuan to the hospital. Association for the Care of the Families of Martyrs who Defended the Country. A Joint Meeting of the Executive Committee was Held Yesterday. The Association for the Care of the Families of Martyrs who Defended the Country held a temporary joint meeting of the executive committee at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

As for the letter from the Shanghai Pi Society to the association, it should use public debt coupons as a fund (resolution) Telegraphed the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang to allocate them. [P The 民治恊會 Advocates Resistance to Japan to the End</p>
<p>The 民治恊會 issued a telegram saying: "To all newspaper offices and all compatriots, The Japanese army invaded Shanghai and held each other for a month. Our army vowed to resist to the death, unyielding and unyielding. However, the enemy repeatedly increased troops, and we had no follow-up support, exhausted and isolated. The entire line retreated, which was caused by the central government's fear and hesitation, which delayed the military opportunity. If we want to seek recovery in the future, we should quickly set a grand plan. We dare to exhaust our foolish sincerity and offer three meanings as left (1) The lost land in the Northeast and Southeast should be recovered at the same time. The enemy is greedy and insatiable. They have already occupied Shanghai and are still advancing westward. We should quickly gather the elite from all sides and launch a large-scale offensive in the north and south at the same time to defeat the enemy's edge and seek recovery. Otherwise, the fertile land in the Northeast and the southeastern Jianghai will be lost for a long time. How can we establish a country (2) Wide fundraising for war expenses should give the people the power to supervise and audit finances. Since the 19th Route Army started resisting Japan, the people have enthusiastically donated and contributed without any scruples. This time, the consolidation of domestic debt and the reduction of principal and interest are also understood by the creditors. From these two points of view, it is not very difficult to raise war expenses. We should quickly gather public opinion organs, pass a wartime budget, and make it fully public to show great credibility. (3) Abolish party rule and use the power of the whole people to unite against foreign countries. The one-party dictatorship has long been criticized by the people. Now that foreign troubles are becoming more and more urgent, we should concentrate talents, abolish the dictatorship, unite against Japan, and cut the expenses of party departments at all levels to supplement the urgent needs of the war. 民治恊會, Yu."</p>
<h3 id="e29">Japanese Ruffians Still Active in Hongkou and Zhabei <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Americans Also Harassed, Japanese Sailors Not Disciplined</p>
<p>The "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that Japanese ruffians caused many incidents involving Chinese and foreigners at the beginning of the war. Now, they are quite active again in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas. These ruffians often accompany army soldiers or marine sailors, but also sometimes form a team with some Japanese civilians. They interfere with vehicles and pedestrians north of North Sichuan Road and Bazijie. The army and navy soldiers often allow them to do as they please without stopping them. As a result, even Chinese and foreigners holding Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) passes are often blocked and unable to pass. Therefore, a new situation is about to occur in Hongkou. If the Japanese diplomatic and military authorities do not crack down on these ruffians who interfere with vehicles and pedestrians, a serious situation may develop. In the past four days, there have been several cases of Westerners being harassed by ruffians. Two of them involved Americans, and both have been reported to the American Consulate General. One involved a young lady who was beaten by a Japanese ruffian and has already protested to the Japanese Consulate General. The other involves American Commercial Commissioner Robert Rawlinson. According to what was heard today (the 7th), he has not yet filed a formal protest. Mr. Rawlinson was inspecting the Hongkou area by car on Saturday afternoon, driving slowly and forced to the side of the road to give way. A Japanese naval vehicle rammed into the car body and the guardrail, and the Japanese soldiers laughed and left. Mr. Rawlinson then followed them to the barracks on North Sichuan Road to reason with the driver and sailors. Suddenly, a Japanese ruffian came out to interfere and dragged the driver away. As soon as Mr. Rawlinson touched the back of one ruffian, he was beaten. Fortunately, a Japanese sailor came out to stop him, placing himself between Mr. Rawlinson and the ruffian, preventing him from being seriously injured, and allowing him to return to his car and drive away. However, the Japanese sailors did not restrain the ruffian, so as Mr. Rawlinson was leaving, the ruffian reached into the car through the window and punched him. In addition, it has become common recently to see Chinese people with passes being unreasonably blocked and turned back by Japanese ruffians after passing Chinese police and Japanese soldiers. According to reports, during the first five days of the war, Japanese ruffians in the Hongkou area arbitrarily beat pedestrians, arrested and searched them, and committed various excessive acts. After being criticized by Western newspapers, the Japanese Consul and Navy began to crack down. It is said that four or five ringleaders were deported.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement yesterday stating that it would continue to accept goods to慰问the soldiers at the front. The announcement read: "Since the anti-Japanese armies have withdrawn to the rear due to a lack of reinforcements, the people have all sighed with grief and indignation. However, these troops have remained loyal and brave in resisting Japan from beginning to end. The defense line is becoming longer, and the enemy is becoming more numerous. They are exhausting themselves for the country and are truly worthy of sympathy. All sectors of our Shanghai society have already enthusiastically contributed to the front, and we should continue to strive in the rear so as not to let down the soldiers who are dying for the country at the front. The Chamber will sincerely welcome all sectors that continue to donate to慰问the army. We will continue to transport the items to the front for use as needed. This is announced."</p>

<p>Wearing Japanese Military Uniforms, They Inspect Good Citizens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the only road from the Public Concession to Zhabei was North Sichuan Road. In the morning, some people went there, but upon reaching Zhabei, they encountered Jiangbei traitors, lackeys of the tiger, wearing Japanese military uniforms and performing strict inspections on behalf of the Japanese army. If they found banknotes or silver, the traitors would pocket them. If you reasoned with them, you would be lightly stabbed with a knife or severely detained in the so-called Jiangbei Headquarters and illegally imprisoned. Occasionally, some traitors, accompanied by Japanese soldiers, were at the intersections of various roads at the junction of the Chinese and Foreign concessions. When they encountered people walking from the concessions into the Chinese territory, in addition to conducting searches, they used steel needles to tattoo two Japanese flags in a crossed shape on the people's arms. After the tattoo was complete, they applied colored liquid, which was permanently difficult to remove. This was so that Chinese military police, upon seeing it, would suspect them of being Japanese spies and kill them. Their methods of harming compatriots are extremely cruel. We advise the public not to go to Zhabei lightly unless necessary to avoid being killed. However, these Jiangbei traitors who assist the wicked should be dealt with as soon as possible to reassure good people.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Jiangbei Hoodlums Rob Clothing and Flee into the Concession <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>No Fewer Than Several Dozen Intercepted</p>
<p>After our army retreated, the residents of Zhabei returned home to move their belongings. A group of Jiangbei hoodlums took the opportunity to be active, robbing everywhere. They stole clothing and fled into the Concession. Therefore, detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) have intercepted no fewer than several dozen of these bandits at the junction of the Chinese and Foreign concessions in recent days. Most of the stolen goods are clothing chests and packages. The police authorities have now decided that any robbers intercepted at the border, after being identified by the police as having stolen the goods from the Chinese territory, will be immediately sent to the relevant police station along with the stolen goods for interrogation to avoid backlog and to respect sovereignty.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau has increased the number of railway police and protected the route along the way to maintain public order for the convenience of travelers. Because passengers are especially crowded, additional carriages have been added to the passenger trains traveling to Hangzhou every day to meet the needs. Therefore, the number of tickets sold each day has reached five to six thousand yuan, which is said to be three to four times higher than usual. Yesterday morning at 8:30, the passenger train arriving from Hangzhou was extremely crowded with passengers.</p>

Yesterday, Xu Xiqing, director of the Nanjing Office of the Ministry of Industry, telegraphed the two associations to make a selection quickly. The telegram read: "To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China Industrial Federation, the previous order has been received.

<h3 id="e36">Residents of Fengxian County Request Reduction of Harsh Taxes <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Residents of Fengxian County sent a telegram to the Provincial Government stating: "Respectfully to Director General of the Civil Affairs and Finance Department of Zhenjiang, Upon investigation, Fengxian has suffered from famine for years. The regular tax for the 20th year of the Republic was reduced, with each mu (unit of land) being reduced by a small amount of silver, ranging from slightly less than one fen (monetary unit) to no more than three fen. However, the surtax per mu includes seven fen and four li (smaller monetary unit) for education, two fen and one li for construction, one fen and seven li for party affairs, one fen and seven li for grain storage, one fen and four li for autonomy, one fen for agriculture, three fen and four li for public security, five fen and nine li for the police force, four li for preparation, one jiao (larger monetary unit) for land survey, and two fen for special autonomy donations. In total, an additional three jiao and seven fen is collected per mu, which is already an unbearable burden for our small people. However, County Magistrate Shen Qingchen recruited a defense corps in February of this year. Disregarding the people's ability to pay, he levied a cigarette tax of ten wen (smallest monetary unit) per ten cigarettes and a tea tax of ten wen per pot, instead of following the prudent handling of neighboring counties such as Songjiang and Nanhui. Stores donating one-thousandth of their monthly sales of one hundred to five hundred yuan, one and a half one-thousandth of sales between five hundred and one thousand yuan, two one-thousandth of sales between one thousand and five thousand yuan, and three one-thousandth of sales over five thousand yuan. A household tax of two jiao of silver per household per month. A mu tax of one jiao of silver per ten mu per month for those with twenty to one hundred mu, and an additional five li per mu per month for those with over one hundred mu. This clearly violates Provincial Order No. 655 and Your Order No. 602, which states that expenditures should be based on income and that the people's burden should not be increased. Moreover, during this time of national crisis, all industries have come to a standstill, and there is no way to borrow money. It is already extremely difficult to survive, and it is impossible to pay the harsh taxes. Having no other choice, we specially send this telegram to Your Excellency, urgently requesting that you issue a telegram to County Magistrate Shen Qingchen of Fengxian County to immediately abolish the above-mentioned harsh and miscellaneous taxes on cigarettes, tea, shops, households, and land, and to handle the defense corps properly by reducing the expenditures of various party and government agencies, so as to alleviate the people's suffering and respect Your Order. The locality would be extremely fortunate. Citizens of Fengxian County, Hu Dewang, etc., respectfully request."</p>

Now, due to the needs of the current situation, he is promoting and teaching this type of swordsmanship. Those who are interested can go to the association to learn.</p>

<p>Adjournment for Fifteen Minutes to Mourn Briand</p>
<h3 id="e43">Our Country Accepts Previous Resolution <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council opened its meeting at 3:45 p.m. today. Dr. Yen (顏惠慶) declared that he received a telegram from T.V. Soong (宋子文) stating that China has accepted the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council and is prepared to negotiate a ceasefire limited to the cessation of hostilities and the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Japanese troops. However, negotiations have not yet begun because the relevant authorities have not yet taken action on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Assembly Receives News of Briand's Death <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>As soon as Mr. Titulescu finished speaking, news of Briand's death spread in whispers throughout the assembly, causing a moment of sorrowful silence. Then, Speaker Hymans gave a signal, rose to confirm the news, and praised Briand's lifelong efforts in pursuit of peace, saying that Briand had cultivated friendship among nations, and his contribution to the creation of the League of Nations was unmatched by anyone else. The Council then adjourned for fifteen minutes as a sign of respect for Briand. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Opinions Expressed by the Romanian Representative <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Romanian representative Mr. Titulescu continued to express his opinion, saying that there is now a possibility of reaching a resolution without harming the dignity of either side. Mr. Titulescu suggested that it should be based on (1) an immediate and effective cessation of hostilities, (2) a prompt negotiation of a ceasefire that does not contain political conditions but embodies the spirit of encouraging successful peace negotiations, (3) the implementation of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates that the League of Nations Administrative Council should issue a warning and order respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of member states. Mr. Titulescu declared that any action violating this article would be a fatal blow to the League of Nations. (4) The protection of Japanese residents and their property. (5) Negotiations should be conducted with caution and respect for treaties, especially the Treaty of Versailles and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (6) The League of Nations should declare a simple doctrine that all members should abide by regardless of their geographical situation. Mr. Titulescu does not consider it appropriate to focus solely on procedures, saying that the Council's discussion must produce a practical resolution containing a solemn declaration of a guiding principle for any resolution, which may ultimately need to be provided by the Council.</p>

<p>(Geneva) It is expected that the opinions of the representatives of the League of Nations Council will be fully expressed today, and then work can begin on drafting a resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, several delegations are now gritting their teeth, determined to ignore the position of the drafting committee and proceed according to their own principles, such as making strong demands and advocating for a special drafting committee to be elected by secret ballot, so that representatives of major powers unrelated to the case can join, so that the most concise resolution can be drafted, in which the Manchurian problem receives at least the same prominence as the Shanghai problem. This is also within expectations and not surprising. China's chief representative, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, sent telegrams received daily to the League of Nations Secretariat stating that Japanese troops are still attacking between Jiading and Taicang and in Nanxiang.

<p>(Geneva) The fourth report from the consuls of various countries in Shanghai regarding the Shanghai Incident has been telegraphed to the League of Nations. The conclusion states: "It must be stated now that all attempts to achieve a satisfactory ceasefire have so far failed. Japanese troops are currently ceasing to advance, but fighting is still continuing in the defense zones outside the concessions at night. During the period covered by this report, the Japanese side continued to interfere with police and other municipal duties. This matter has become the subject of repeated protests to the Japanese authorities." The report covers events up to 2:40 a.m. on March 5. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

The telegram continued, "Dr. Yen also sent a telegram received from T.V.

<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the League of Nations Special General Assembly, Mr. Hymans, declared to a Havas News Agency reporter: "There has been no shortage of sarcasm in recent days, saying that the General Assembly is discussing while the sound of cannons rumbles in the Far East. But this kind of attitude can only come from those who are ill-intentioned. In fact, the convocation of the General Assembly is precisely because the sound of cannons in the Far East has already begun to boom, and whether the cannons will continue is far from certain. Now, there is a de facto truce in the Shanghai area. The General Assembly is now fulfilling its conciliatory mission. Therefore, according to Article 15 of the Covenant, it is requesting Japan to withdraw its troops. The act of aggression itself does not constitute a true act of hostility, but it cannot be placed outside of acts of hostility and must be regarded as a use of force. All of this is prohibited by the Covenant. The General Assembly's conciliatory mission is to seek a solution to the Shanghai situation for both parties involved. However, the General Assembly is far away in Geneva and cannot supervise the implementation of its resolutions. Therefore, it is entrusting officials, both civil and military, of the relevant countries stationed in Shanghai to organize a committee to participate. Once a ceasefire is implemented, a round table conference will be held in Shanghai to continue the work of the General Assembly. If it still fails, then we should apply the second step of the procedure stipulated in the Covenant." (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>(Luoyang) The third formal meeting of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th in the East Flower Garden Assembly Hall of the West Palace.

(Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee concluded on the 6th. Wang Zhaoming delivered closing remarks. The summarized record is as follows:</p>
<p>The significant meaning of the resolutions passed by the congress is included in the declaration of the congress. Whether the congress is effective and meaningful must be proven by whether the resolutions can be implemented. The difficulty of our current situation is similar to that of the late Ming Dynasty. In the late Ming Dynasty, there was the invasion of Liaodong by the Manchus and the scourge of rebel bandits such as Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong internally. Now, we have Japanese invaders externally and Red bandits internally, which is the same. In the late Ming Dynasty, people in the court made the mistake of being vain and arrogant, not knowing how to use strength to think of ways to save the crisis. As a result, loyal ministers and righteous men could only repay the country with their deaths. The reason for the fall of the Ming Dynasty lies here. Repaying the country is not something that can be fulfilled with one's death. It is necessary to use methods and strength. In politics, we must realize democratic centralized politics to seek the strictness of the political organization and the realization of the democratic centralized political system. With the democratic centralized system establishing a center of gravity in politics, we can resist Japan externally and eliminate the Communist Party internally. If we do this, China will never perish. At present, we are not focusing on the momentary success or failure of military affairs, or the consciousness of national indignation, or competing with the Communist Party for leadership, but on the sincere cooperation of our comrades to seek the realization of democratic centralization to complete the organization of Chinese politics. Now that we have made a great determination, we must have the ability to do it. Our hearts are very urgent, but at the same time, very firm. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Luoyang) The Declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang states: "The national crisis is deepening, and it is time for our party to accept its mandate in the face of danger. This congress summarizes and resolves various cases and declares the following:</p>
<p>At present, the most urgent task is to resist invasion. The armed comrades in the Shanghai battles, following orders to defend the territory and fulfilling their duties to the best of their abilities, sacrificed heroically to contend for the survival of the nation, truly setting an example for the national army. All troops in the country should embrace the same determination to resist for the long term. Those who shirk and evade designated tasks will not be tolerated by the government and will be abandoned by the country. As for pacifying bandits, it is necessary to consolidate the rear and alleviate the people's suffering, which cannot be ignored. Diplomacy and military affairs go hand in hand. We must weigh the situation and make decisions based on the overall interests of the nation, not based on coping with the domestic environment. The improvement of politics is not only related to resisting invasion at present but also to the great foundation for the country to avenge its humiliation and seek strength. It should be reformed in order and carried out calmly. We plan to first thoroughly eliminate corruption and determine the principle that military personnel in charge should not also serve as local administrative officials, in order to bring local politics back on track. In terms of finance, we should first publicly implement reduced government spending to achieve clear and honest governance and cultivate national strength and people's livelihood. The completion of constitutional government has a certain procedure. However, during the period of political tutelage, we should first actively establish public opinion organs to cultivate the foundation of civil rule. Only in this way can mutual trust arise and authority be established. To our comrades, during this period of national crisis, our comrades should regard cooperating to resist invasion as a sacred duty, clarify right and wrong, distinguish truth from falsehood, strengthen unity, and concentrate our strength. We should take responsibility to advocate for the people and strive to be the first in the world to act. We should sacrifice for our principles and establish the self-confidence and personality of revolutionary party members. Then, the development and glorification of our party's history will surely be without end. Furthermore, to our compatriots, today is the time for our entire nation to fight for survival, not the time for mutual blame. The national crisis has reached this point, and the causes and effects are numerous. Since the central government has made the determination to resist for the long term, our compatriots should fight for the survival of the country. Do not be vain, do not be cowardly, do not be lightly optimistic, and do not be easily pessimistic. We should express the highest consciousness of the nation with a calm and courageous spirit. All the previously conflicting factions and complex opinions should be completely melted and cast into this great national consciousness. The nation will then be able to have salvation, and the key to national rejuvenation lies in this. Moreover, to all countries in the world, international conventions have been signed by sovereign states to pursue free will and must be jointly guaranteed their dignity. China has been forced to resist for self-defense, and at the same time, it is resisting to guarantee the dignity of the convention. If the convention is reduced to waste paper, there will be no peace in the world. If tyranny is not restrained, there will be no peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>Licking the crumbs and</p>
<p>The rice, should be alarmed, raise</p>
<p>The viper without crushing, the arm will eventually be bitten. This whole</p>
<p>The meeting firmly believes that China is an organized and resilient country. The recent situation in Shanghai is a manifestation of this fact. War zones should be strategically changed as needed, but China's determination to resist will last forever and without interruption. Any humiliating conditions of surrender will never be recognized or signed. Friendly countries that uphold justice and guarantee the convention, within the scope of not harming China's territorial sovereignty, China is happy to cooperate sincerely in economic terms. Not only do we hope that friendly countries can have a clear understanding of this, but we also hope that the Japanese people who know that their warlords are tyrannical will have a deep realization of this. In short, with foreign troops pressing the border, the country has entered an extraordinary period. All decisions should prioritize the big picture. From now on, we will only seek realization through practical action and seek survival through struggle. This is hereby declared." (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Case is Under Mediation (Nanjing)</p>
<p>It is learned from the Foreign Affairs Committee that, after several days of informal Sino-British-Japanese contacts on the Shanghai British warships, our side insisted that troops must be withdrawn first before meetings can be held, but the Japanese side refused. Now, a telegram has been sent to Yan Huiqing to inquire about how to deal with the general assembly, because the ceasefire was initiated by the League of Nations, and the League of Nations cannot stand idly by after the ceasefire measures. Another telegram was sent to the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Luoyang, requesting instructions on how to deal with the Shanghai Case. According to another source, the dispute over the withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese troops remains unresolved. British and American mediators plan to mediate again, following the precedent of the Jinan Case, where Japan first agreed to withdraw all troops from Chinese territory within a certain number of days, and then began peace talks. However, the government says that this mediation proposal has not yet been received. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>According to sources in charge today, although Japan is prepared to begin withdrawing its troops as soon as hostile acts cease, Japan may station a portion of its troops in the Public Concession indefinitely, as Japan has the same right to station troops as Britain and the United States.

<p>France Abandons Plan to Alienate Austria Invites Germany to Cooperate Relief for Southern European Economy Vienna</p>
<p>French Minister to Austria, Claude, officially notified Austrian Chancellor Bleych that France had invited Germany to cooperate in discussing good strategies to relieve the economic distress of Southern Europe, especially Austria. A copy of yesterday's note to the German Foreign Ministry was sent to the Austrian Chancellor for review. The content vigorously refutes rumors that France intends to organize an anti-German group in Southeast Europe, and invites Germany to participate in a preferential tariff system. The Austrian political circles now believe that Germany's invitation is a good omen for the future of Southern Europe, indicating that France has abandoned its plan to alienate Germany and Austria. The Austrian Chancellor also stated the importance of this move by the French government, hoping that after negotiations, a solution to Austria's difficulties can be found.

<p>Briand Passed Away Yesterday (Paris)</p>
<p>Briand, a respected French politician who had served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister many times, passed away at 1:30 pm today at the age of 70. In the past decade, there has not been a single French government without Briand's participation. His importance in French political life is evident. Recently, in Geneva and Paris, he worked hard to seek a peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, which will be remembered forever. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Briand was the founder of the Paris Peace Pact, and he attended the Geneva and Paris conferences to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute while ill, making significant contributions. A previous Reuters dispatch reported that Briand was restrained by the French Army General Staff and could not fulfill his ambitions. Therefore, Briand also regretted the current state of the Sino-Japanese dispute. How will the Chinese people express their condolences to him?</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The death of Briand greatly shocked London's political circles. Reuters transmitted the news by telephone to members of the House of Commons, and then to all members of Parliament. The entire House expressed deep sorrow. Members of Parliament only knew that Briand was seriously ill, but did not expect him to pass away so suddenly. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Briand's heart disease did not initially show any dangerous signs. It was not until the end of last week that his physical strength greatly weakened and became gradually concerning. By yesterday, hope was almost gone. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Ji told reporters that he had traveled to more than ten countries, including England, Germany, France, the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Cuba, Canada, and Belgium, focusing on the study of agriculture and industry. He saw that China's agriculture should develop auxiliary products, industry should not be large-scale capital, and factories should avoid overproduction. Because the violent Japanese invasion stimulated him too much, he returned to China, hoping to do his personal best. China is not unable to defeat Japan. If he were to lead troops at this time, and could not resist Japan, he would immediately commit suicide. Although his old subordinates wanted him to go back, he would only go back if the guns were pointed outwards. European and American countries are actively expanding their armaments, and the Chinese people should wake up quickly. At this time, great sacrifices must be made to avoid piecemeal sacrifices in the future. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>India's Budget Proposal Strong Financial Position New Delhi</p>
<p>When Hsu Shih-chang, the Finance Member of the Executive Council, presented the budget proposal to the Legislative Assembly today, he declared that India's budget proposal was very satisfactory due to reduced government spending and streamlined operations. He doubled that no country in the world could match India's strong financial position and bright future prospects. The budget proposal for the current fiscal year is estimated to be short 10.125 million British pounds, while the next fiscal year is projected to have a surplus of 1.687 million British pounds. However, the expenditure item includes 10.05 million pounds for debt repayment. The decrease in revenue is due to the short collection of customs duties, especially on sugar, silver, wine, cotton goods, and piece goods. Army expenses will be reduced by more than 3.25 million pounds, and railway expenses will be reduced to just over 3 million pounds. In addition to paying off maturing debts, there will be no new borrowing. Hsu also defended the government's policy of transporting cash for export and expanding the currency, saying that this has strengthened India's exchange rate and increased India's credit.

<p>Important News Western Newspapers Report on Recent Attitudes of Russia and Japan</p>
<p>Both Russia and Japan claim they do not want war, but each wants to protect its industry and people, which may lead to unpleasant disputes.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported on February 24 from Harbin that travelers arriving here from Europe said that they had seen 15 German engineers on the train leaving Moscow. They openly stated that they were hired by the Soviet Russian government to build fortresses on both sides of the Manchurian border to strengthen defense. Some of them have gone to Vladivostok, and the rest have gone to Boli and other places. Troops are often seen developing eastward in Siberia, and there are open cars filled with airplanes and artillery. It is heard that about 150,000 troops have arrived in Vladivostok. There are also five transport vehicles. According to Soviet Russian newspapers, Soviet Russia does not want to attack anyone, but the Manchurian White Russians claim that Japan is willing to help them return to their country, and their aggressive attitude requires Soviet Russia to prepare for emergencies. If Soviet Russian industry or land is indeed in danger, then Soviet Russia will take countermeasures, but there is no such sign at present. The Japanese military authorities have also announced that they do not want to start a dispute with Soviet Russia. The serious state of the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the possibility that the road may be cut off by the old Jilin army, isolating it from Harbin, may cause the Soviet Russian army to cross the border to protect the road. Others should have no objection to this, because Soviet Russia does have the right to protect its industry and people, just like Japan. However, if this happens, it may lead to unpleasant disputes. In Harbin, there has been no news of Soviet Russian military tunnel actions. Railway personnel are all sticking to their duties and do not express any opinions on the current situation.</p>

<p>Currently, a large number of Japanese warships are docked in Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, and other places, and more than ten Japanese warships, such as Wutake, Tsukitake, Sanae, Soso, and Hibiscus, are alternately traveling between the three ports of Qingdao, Yantai, and Longkou. Recently, Japanese people regard Yantai as the hub of the Shanghai-Tianjin route, so they sent the 13th Chase Fleet to Yantai to dock. On the 1st of this month, the fleet sent personnel ashore again, demanding to set up a Japanese naval headquarters in the Customs Building at the Customs Wharf, and arbitrarily sent personnel into the city to inspect. Our Yantai authorities sternly rejected this. In the afternoon, they secretly sent Japanese naval officers to Dongshan, Yantai, to spy on our national defense fort. The intention of the Japanese this time is to contain our country's military preparations against Japan in various places. The troops and police stationed in Yantai took serious precautions that night for fear of any eventuality, and sent a large number of security teams to patrol the coast. If Japan intends to provoke, they must strive to defend themselves to consolidate national defense. (March 2)</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui's Army Marches from Quan to Hengzhou He Jian Has Agreed to Allow Passage Guangzhou Communications:</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui's army, which had previously volunteered to aid Heilongjiang, had already arrived at Quanzhou on the border of Hunan from Guangxi. However, due to the issue of passage and the collection of military funds, it was delayed. When the Shanghai battle broke out, the army urgently needed to advance. Recently, Hunan and He have clearly expressed their views on the army's transit, and the issue of the army's departure expenses has also been resolved. Earlier, Bai Chongxi sent a telegram to Hunan and He regarding the army's crossing the Hunan border, saying, [Chairman He Yunqiao of Changsha, my respected brother, I have respectfully received your cold telegram. I have ordered the Fourth Army to continue to advance on a specified date. When passing through Hunan, I pray that you will give guidance and convenience. Your brother, Bai Chongxi, kowtows.] Later, He Jian replied in a telegram, [The Japanese pirates are pressing without end, and there is no way to survive without a battle. This is the time for soldiers to serve the country. I wish you to avenge your hatred and relieve the urgent difficulties as soon as possible. Commander Xianghua's troops have passed through Hunan, and I have ordered my subordinates to treat them properly.] Thereupon, Wu Qiwai, the army's division commander, took a car from Nanning to Guilin on February 20, and transferred from Guilin to Quanzhou on the 24th to inspect the Division's 〇〇th Regiment of Ou Zhen, the 〇〇〇th Regiment of Shen Youwen, the 〇〇〇th Regiment of Luo Weiyong, and expanded the newly编th Battalion of Yin Chengjun into a supplementary regiment to increase their strength. As for Wu's departure expenses, they were also supplied by various parties. The Guangdong authorities plan to appropriate 100,000 yuan from the anti-Japanese preparation fund for relief. It is also heard that Zhang Fakui also raised a large sum of money in Nanjing and Shanghai for the army's departure and expansion, and to purchase military supplies. It is estimated that within three days, the army can advance towards Hengyang. As for the Hunan army's generals, they also sent a telegram yesterday, [To resist Japan, ]The telegram was led by He Jian and roughly stated, [Recently, the Japanese army unexpectedly attacked the garrison in Shanghai in the evening and carried out arson and killing. Although our 19th Route Army met them head-on and inflicted heavy damage on them, the atrocities have not ended. They have also landed in Shantou. If we do not urgently plan to deal with them, how can we serve the country? We have participated in the revolution for many years and dare not lag behind others. At this critical juncture of the life and death of the nation and the country, we have actively prepared and will immediately charge forward as soon as the Central Government gives the order.] After He Jian and others sent out the telegram, they also sent representatives He Wenyuan and Liu Zhaofu to Guangdong to visit Li Zongren, Chen Jitang, and others to discuss Southwest military affairs and unified anti-Japanese issues.

<p>Jiangbei is Closely Guarded Each County Draws Soldiers to Form a Reserve Defense Regiment and Strictly Prohibits Traitors from Selling Food to Aid the Enemy Nantong Communications:</p>
<p>The coastal counties of Jiangbei are increasingly focused on defense. Therefore, they draw soldiers to form a reserve defense regiment to assist in defense. The artillery of the 〇〇〇th Route Army has seized the Jiangmian Ferry at Langfu. In recent days, each county has strictly prohibited traitors from selling rice, grain, and vegetables to aid the enemy. Nantong's self-defense expenses are temporarily issued by the Kuanchanchu for 100,000 yuan in loan coupons. All arrangements have been made. Zhang Zhijiang telegraphed the county magistrates, saying, Ever since the Shanghai Incident occurred, our army has resisted for self-defense. Although we have won every battle, the Japanese pirates have repeatedly increased their reinforcements and invaded our country. A great battle is in full swing. This is a critical juncture for the life and death of our families. The troops stationed in various places should be ready to go to aid, and the public security in the rear must rely on the local defense regiment. Consolidating the rear and pacifying the bandits are of great importance to the safety and security of the people. The Yangtze River and coastal areas of Jiangsu will be the first to bear the brunt once there is an alarm, which is incomparable to other provinces. Therefore, the organization of the defense regiment is particularly urgent. This supervisor has inspected the defense affairs and found that the people in the counties he has passed through are strong and simple, and originally rich in self-defense capabilities. If we can guide them according to the situation, we will naturally achieve rapid results. The county magistrates are responsible for maintaining public security and must pay close attention to this. After receiving the telegram, they must organize and establish the defense regiment on a specified date and conduct active and strict training. As for the Tongyang Motor Road, it has been built and the defense line along the river is also connected, and the defense is extremely tight. In addition, the Provincial Government ordered the County Government to supervise the auction of inferior goods that have been sealed by local public groups and to draw 3% of the sales value to fill the flood relief funds. Nantong is peaceful and the money houses have not yet opened.</p>

While it was being handled, it suddenly received instructions from the province, stating that the foreign aggression was imminent and the need for funds was urgent. It ordered all counties to collect two months' rent to support it, and was handling it according to the precedents of previous years. The county magistrate then proposed it for discussion at the Self-Defense Committee on the 3rd. After discussion, it was decided to revoke the measures proposed by the Self-Defense Committee and handle it in accordance with the provincial order. However, it was proposed that 30% of the funds be used to fill the county's self-defense expenses, which was submitted to the province for approval. It has now been proceeding in accordance with the received and praised methods.</p>
