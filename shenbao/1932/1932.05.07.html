<h3 id="c1">美蘇携手之推斷 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>頃近以來。以遠東形勢之日趨惡化。美蘇携手之聲甚囂塵上。迨美國務卿史汀生赴歐。在日内瓦與蘇外長李特維拉夫會面。而美將承認蘇聯及美蘇同盟之空氣。乃愈形濃厚。雖美國務院。曾明白表示美國無改變對蘇態度之意。但其爲在時機尙未成熟之先。故佈疑陣。以爲掩飾之一種外交手段。則固可不言而共喻者也。</p>
<p>夫美爲資本主義達到爛熟時期之國家。與蘇根本處於敵對之營壘。自蘇聯革命而後。美蘇間殆無關係可言。直至現在。猶爲未與蘇聯復活國交之唯一大國。丁此資本主義日趨於動搖艱境時。而謂美國反與蘇聯携手。甚且作進一步之聯盟。是果眞有可能乎。</p>
<p>吾人之答語曰可能。固矣美蘇以國體之不同。政治經濟制度之不同。就其根本言之。始終處於敵對之地位。然而就目前之國際形勢觀之。則美蘇在某種條件之下。暫時携手。未嘗不可能也。何也。美之與蘇斷絶國交。其原因爲（一）忿蘇聯不承認帝俄時代之外債。（二）防蘇宣傳共產主義。（三）恐僑蘇美人之生命財產無安全之保障。今第一點旣巳成過去之往事。第三點亦爲不必有之過慮。而第二點防止共產主義之宣傳。在蘇聨今日防守外交政策之下。固亦爲其所可承諾。更以美之黃金國家。而日步入破落之艱境。蘇以窮困之破落户。而日即於繁榮之途。美國機器之銷售產品之輸出。都足以使美蘇之間過去不良之印象。漸趨於融洽。雖美對於蘇之「屯併」。今猶時存戒備。未敢疏忽。但國際間之經濟關聯。固不以帮交之斷絶而斷絶。蘇雖可對美輸出產品。美亦可對蘇聯輸出資本。防止「屯併」。固不必斷絶邦交。設美蘇復交此種交涉。</p>
<p>固無不可以合理之手段。求正當之解决。抑且美波拉調查報告。則且巳證明蘇聯並無壓迫勞工擾亂市塲之行爲。是則美蘇之携手。其可能性正多。</p>
<p>然而造成美蘇趨於携手之最大根因。則猶不在於是。而在於遠東惡劣情勢之逼迫。美國爲維持其商業上之利益。并打破列强在遠東之勢力範圍。其外交政策。自海士以來。即爲「門户開放機會均等」。華盛頓會議之召集。藍辛石井協定之廢除。海軍政策之改變。皆爲欲維持此一神聖原則於永久也。但自去年九一八。日本突然實力發動。佔領東北。今年一二八。復進窺我淞滬而後。一切國際條約。旣無形中巳成廢紙。而美之門户開放機會均等之外交原則。亦遂遭受嚴重之打擊。不能繼續維持。美欲爭奪太平洋上之覇權。爲維持其在遠東之權益。則其對日本之嫉恨。自然不言可知。而其整軍經武。亟謀所以打破日本獨占之形勢。更爲勢所必然。此蓋吾人於史汀生致波拉一函中所可把握體認者也。然而美國未必遂有與日一戰之决心也。蓋美所處地位。距離太遙作戰頗艱。故寗願從外交上促日反省。若不幸而必出於一戰。勢不能不得一與國以牽掣强日。但舉目環顧。英旣有内顧之憂。法復與日有結合。皆不能互相倚助。獨蘇本身旣深感日之脅迫。且其力又足以控制强日。其爲絶好之聯盟者。蓋亦爲時勢所造成。此就美國一方面言。其與蘇聯携手。固有極多之可能也。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯爲打破反蘇之聯合戰綫計。爲防止資本主義國家之攻襲計。其外交政策。刻亦易進取爲防守。如美而願與携手。則固極所歡迎。蘇聯之雷台克曾在伊斯維斯的亞報上發表論文云。「倘有人向蘇聯挑釁。則蘇人將向資本主義國家之不致損及其利益與侵犯其境土者。謀締暫時之聯盟」。是蘇聯之亟盼與美携手。蓋亦巳情見乎辭矣。</p>
<p>綜上而觀。則時勢所迫。美蘇之聯盟。終必有水到渠成之一日。獨是以根本立於敵對地位之國家。美果能容蘇之存在乎。反之。蘇又果能容美之並立乎。</p>
<p>國際政治。瞬息萬變。美蘇就使眞能携手。亦不過國際政治變幻中極短之一幕耳。</p>
<p>勘誤　昨評第八行「日本於」三字係「上海之」三字之誤。第十九行「上海之」三字係「日本於」三字之誤。又莫知所屆句「知」字誤排。「如」特此更正。</p>

<p>（一）上海停戰協定</p>
<p>外間頗有非議者、惟自開議以來、日方主張召集圓桌會議、商訂滬安全及撤廢軍事設施等事項、並宣傳所謂、一創設自由港、二擴充租界、三設立緩衝區等問題、此外如所指抵制日貨、使用仇日敎科書共禍等事項、均經我方節節打破、認定停戰會議祇商撤兵、不涉政治、而日方又提出停止便衣隊活動、及雙方用飛機偵察、並以保護日僑生命財產及營業爲其撤兵條件諸端、均經我方力予爭辯、日方始放棄其主張、日方最初要求駐兵範圍、甚爲廣闊、迭經爭議、乃縮小暫駐地點、日方又提出浦東及蘇州河南、中國駐軍問題、迭經竭力拒絶、彼亦不提、此次停戰協定、雖未能令其即日完全撤退、然就目下國際情形、國内狀况觀之、則交涉經過、實巳智窮力竭、滬集旣告一段落、本部可用全副精神、應付東案、蓋東案乃中日糾紛之根本問題也、</p>
<p>（二）中俄復交問題</p>
<p>本部早巳研究、近來因俄日關係緊張、對此問題、更加注意、聞我方亦頗有希望復交之意、但據報蘇聯近對我駐俄會議代表團、禮儀殊爲遺憾、且彼又有承認傀儡政府爲事務接洽對方之意、凡此舉動、均足爲進行復交之阻碍、（六日專電）</p>

<p>注意芳澤向郭泰祺慶祝</p>
<p>聲明恢復常態不止軍事</p>
<p>前外交部長陳友仁氏、昨對中日停戰協定、發表意見如下、本月五日簽訂的中日停戰協定、究竟是中國的勝利、還是日本的勝利呢、我以爲首先要注意的是下列的兩件事實、（一）據外報紀載、這個協定原本定在五月二日星期一簽字的、但日本人却要求改在五月五日簽字、這個日子是孫中山先生在廣州成立革命政府的第十一週年紀念之日啊、（二）日本外相芳澤、昨在東京爲這個協定的簽定、表示向郭次長泰祺慶祝、自然一個人萬萬不會因自己的敵人戰勝了自己、却反向他慶祝的事、這兩件事實所表明的、就是日本人巳承認這個協定的結果、是日本人的勝利了、更進一步推究、無論從這個協定的大原則上或詳細條文上看、我想日本人還有很好的理由、是承認這個協定爲日本政策勝利的符劵的、何以故呢、大家都知道中華民國的領土、是整個不可分割的、這就是說如果敵人侵犯了中國的一部（如滿洲）、就是侵犯了整個中國、所以中國國民爲什麽要堅持東三省問題與上海問題、一定要作爲同一問題解决的、最大的基本的理論、這是全體中國國民的公意、南京政府的領袖汪先生、也曾宣言過的、可是這個協定的結果、是怎麽樣呢、在南京政府和那些幼稚的外交家、以爲上海停戰協定、止是軍事的問題的臨時協定、不致涉到政治問題、自然與國家領土之統一完整、不相侵犯、但是事實上有那麽一回事麽、當甲國一部份領土、受乙國的侵略、而甲國和乙國竟然簽字了自己另外一部份領土暫時休戰的協定、可是其餘的一部份領土、還依然繼續在敵人侵略之中、這不是明明巳經將自己的領土統一完整撕破了嗎、所謂祇是解决軍事不涉政治、還不是自欺欺人之談麽、還有一層、據李頓的調查報告、其最注重之點、就是指出東三省自從日本覇佔了七個月、依然陷於極端紛亂之狀態、在日本人的宣言、本來是說他所以要派兵佔領東三省、是因爲要維持東三省的治安、如今日本人、還有什麽話說呢、國聯調查團巳指出日本人侵略的結果、只是造成了東三省的無政府狀態罷了、這是對於日本政府在國際上的面子很壞的一椿事、日本人正在企圖怎樣恢復東三省的治安、就是用盡全國兵力、也在所不計的、日本人爲着這個緣故、所以才𤍠望上海停戰問題之早得解决、俾他可以調回在上海的一部精鋭之師到東三省去來消滅中國人民抗日死戰的義勇軍、以完成他攫取整個東三省的計劃、而同時在我們中國方面呢、却由這一紙的協定、限制了中國軍隊、不能再自由調遣到本屬自巳領土的上海週圍、日本人却因爲有這一紙協定的保障、可以節省了上海五萬駐兵的兵力和浩大的軍費、此後祗使用少數的部隊、就可以很安慰地拿着上海了、這不是於日本人最有利益的嗎、還有一層、詳細考究這個協定的條文、如第二條所載、「中國軍隊在本協定所涉及區域之常態恢復未經决定辦法以前、留駐其現在地位、」究竟所謂常態恢復、幾時才能决定呢、幾時才得日本人同意的决定呢、而且日本人還聲明所謂常態恢復、不止於軍事、就是反日的宣傳排貨的運動等等、也都在内、此外日人還在外報宣言、他們所認爲涉及區域連蘇州以南黃浦江以東一帶地段、也在其内、而我方却沒有聲明否認、照這樣推測、我國在上海的主權、還容易有恢復的希望嗎、有人也許會說、然則你便主張日本軍隊不退出上海還好嗎、我可以無疑的回答、日本軍隊自然要退出上海、但不止僅退出了上海、還要他同時退出東三省、不然就只有抵抗、只有拚命的抵抗、</p>

<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>和平會議閉幕了。停戰協定謄淸後。送至雙方代表的「牀前」一簽字就行了。愛國的團體們。儘顧在嚷着反對。然而一般酷愛和平的民衆們。却未嘗不在那裏「馨香祝禱」着呢。</p>
<p>最有趣不過的。就是這「牀前」二字。唐詩上說。「牀前明月光。疑是地上霜。舉頭望明月。低頭思故鄉。」如今不知我國的代表。當在床前簽字的時候。想起了這首唐詩。再想起了我們的「故鄉」。心中究作若何感想呢。</p>
<p>左傳上說。「牀第之言不踰閾。」因爲牀第之言。只好在床上言之。所以絶對要守秘密。現在這個「和平會議」。自始至終。總是抱着「秘密」二字。因其爲秘密·所以簽字也必須在牀上爲之了。</p>
<p>中日兩國的代表。都因爲受了傷。臥在床上簽字。我想如果將二榻並陳起來。倒好來一個「聯牀夜話抵足長談」呢。可惜那位重光公使和植田中將的尊足都有了傷。抵起「足」來。畢竟有些不大方便咧。</p>
<p>我寫到這裏。有位纏夾二先生見了說道。怪不得兩國政府一向說着「中日親善」。原來他兩口子眞好得了不得呢。有道是「夫妻相打不用勸。只要床上……」如今中日兩國打了幾個月。果然只在「牀上」這麽一來。便又好起來了。我聽了也不禁笑道。噢。原來如此。</p>

<p>— 玉相</p>
<p>一個英國人的愛好自由。宛如愛他依照法律給合的。曾在禮拜寺内舉行過婚禮。並經牧師正式證婚的妻子一般。整個的伊。是屬於他所有的一件東西。也許因爲家花不及野花香的緣故。他對待伊不會十分溫存體貼。然而。合理和適度的保護。他是决不肯放鬆。而且很願意始終負責的。</p>
<p>在一個法國人的眼光裏。自由简直就像他私底下戀着的情人一樣可愛。更進一層作個譬喻。法國人之視自由。可說像是一朶俏麗動人的野玫瑰花。它有燦爛的色彩。它也有濃郁的香氣。它更有甜蜜的滋味。但是呀。它滿身生遍了尖剌。一不留意。也許會使人皮破膚裂的。然而。色情狂的法國人。爲了自由。雖是赴湯蹈火。粉身碎骨。任憑怎樣犧牲。都所不惜。的確。他是着了自由的迷了。</p>
<p>再講一個德國人吧。他對於自由的態度。完全像對待他的老祖母一般。意思是說。他祇是莊而敬之。並不怎樣𤍠烈親愛的。</p>
<p>話雖是這樣說。然而天下事勢的轉移。誰又能夠預先料到呢。</p>
<p>當一個英國人發起脾氣來的時候。也許他會硬了心腸。給他妻子一頓痛打或惡駡。深深地蹂躪着伊的。</p>
<p>法國人呢。那是更富於危險性了。深巷小街間的野草閒花。在在施着不可抵禦的誘惑力。使他隨時都有離棄他的情人的可能。不錯。在法國境内。想找一個新的情人。並不是一件難事。</p>
<p>然而德國人却永不會發這種壞脾氣。或是做這類薄倖事情的。他不致於十分冷淡他的老祖母。他願意他所愛敬的老祖母。時常安息在客廳中的沙發椅子裏。在那邊。伊可以講一些神仙故事之類。給伊的孫男女們聽呢。</p>

<h3 id="c161">競過以後 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 際雲</p>
<p>自從去年十二月十二日，全市中小學「愛國活動成績競賽會」競過以後，一、</p>
<p>直到現在，我們敎育界，又做了些什麽工作？昨天接到「上海市敎育界救國會執行委員會」寄來的一封信，其中有一段</p>
<p>「……迺者戰事旣停，砲聲漸遠，各校大都開課，而前此奔走救國精神，又轉覺稍稍沉寂矣。本會迭接各方來函，談及此事，均以最近上海敎育界，對於救國工作，不甚𤍠心爲言。…」</p>
<p>我看了這段文字，心裏覺得非常慚愧。我們敎育界對於救國工作，自從「愛國活動成績競賽會」競過以後，的確冷靜了許多，現在簡直找不到一些敎育界的救國工作，這也是敎育界的「五分鐘」。</p>
<p>智識階級尙且這樣，也何怪一般奸商呢？所以無知識階級肯賣國，有知識階級也一樣的肯賣國。大家都知道直接爲滿奴，間接爲日婢的滿淸探花鄭孝胥嗎？他不能算沒有敎育的，不能算不識字的，大家還知道瀋陽有一個替日本查禁現用小學敎科書爲虎作倀的日本法學博士趙欣伯嗎？他更不是沒有敎育的，更不能算不識字的。所以過去的賣國行爲完全是知識階級，以後的亡國，也許亡在知識階級的手裏。</p>
<p>中國的這樣貧弱，完全歸咎於一般敎師。德法戰爭，日俄戰爭，雖然爭勝於一時，却巳種因於平日。就是日本的侵略主義亦用敎育方法深入民心，使日本民衆習非成是，不覺其爲侵略，日本中小學學生，幾無不以佔領我國疆土爲當然，這是日本極端愛國敎育的效果。現在我國外患之急，甚於任何國家，民族存亡，在於須臾，默觀羣衆，依然人各一心，就是一般敎師，雖有愛國觀念，也是浮而不實，這是最可悲痛的現象。過去的錯誤，譬如昨日死。深望我們敎育界，從今日起，時時刻刻要想着：救國方法，如何籌議，方爲有效？救國工作，如何担任，方爲切實？同事如何團結？學生如何指導？餘時餘力，如何利用？總之，愛國不是一時間的事，</p>

<p>— 陶小桃</p>
<p>糖是我們人生所少不了的一件東西，我們人體之所以會發生體溫，就是因爲炭水化物和脂肪的緣故，（炭水化物是澱粉砂糖的總稱）炭水化物和體内的養氣化合而發給我們各種工作的能力，我們每人普通每天須要炭水化物十三兩半，纔有充分的力量工作，</p>
<p>製糖的原料有三種，一甘蔗，二甜菜，三楓樹，世界上產甘蔗糖的地方有古巴島，我國的廣東，福建，產甜菜糖的地方有德國法國，產楓樹糖的地方有加拿大美國，我國不出產甜菜糖，楓樹糖，祇有少數的甘蔗糖出產，現在因爲篇幅很短，甜菜和楓樹製糖等，以後再說，祗將甘蔗製糖說一說，據天工開物說，我國以前不會製糖，到了唐大曆間（民國前一一四六年）有西僧鄒和尙游四川遂寗縣，始傳種甘蔗製糖法，現在製糖的方法是，先將甘蔗汁壓榨出來，然後用石灰乳同𤍠濾過，澄淸的糖液，放在眞空鍋中煑，爲什麽要放在眞空鍋中煑呢？我們在高山上燒水燒到攝氏表八九十度，水就沸了，因爲高山上空氣稀薄，壓力小，放在眞空鍋中煑，一方面更可以經濟時間和煤炭，所以用眞空鍋來蒸發，蒸發後待冷結晶爲粗糖，這粗糖又溶解，用骨灰濾過，再放入眞空鍋中煑，冷後則成純凈之白糖，</p>

<p>華兒的毛病巳經到上十分危險的時期了，華府的家長們，都憂急得了不得，請了許多有名的醫生們到家裏來，給他治病</p>
<p>診過脈，量過𤍠度，許多的醫生們，都聚在一塊兒，商量診治的方法，</p>
<p>甲說，病人的身體太虚弱了，最好多進滋補的藥品，如人參啊，鹿茸啊，……愈多愈妙，這是「統盤計劃」的辦法，</p>
<p>乙說，不對，他的起病的原因，是由於感受外邪的緣故，補藥是完全不相宜的，不如用些發表的藥劑，把那病魔來實行武力驅逐吧，</p>
<p>丙說，病人的𤍠度大高了，趕快去�</p>
<p>拿些冰來冰着，來壓低他的𤍠�</p>
<p>度吧，</p>
<p>丁說，我看還是打幾針補血針，把他的病體維持着，纔能長期抵抗那病魔呢，</p>
<p>戊說，「……」</p>
<p>你一句，他一聲，漸漸由和緩的討論，而變成激烈的爭辯，末了竟揎拳擄臂的相打起來，經華府的家長們勸解開了，纔一一的送了出去，</p>
<p>華兒在床上嘆氣道，「不服他們的藥方，我還能苟延殘喘，若是服了他們的藥方時，包管馬上要送掉性命了」，</p>
<p>一天一天的過去，華兒的毛病也一天一天的越發沉重了，每天終有好幾簍的藥方，從華府裏丢出來，倒便宜了賣雜貨的張老二，拿來包銅板，包花生米，包什麽東西都有了，</p>

<p>丨丨應徵者之羣</p>
<p>顧公館的傳達現在被二少爺呼喚到他的書房裏去。少爺們的房裏，他本來是不容易跑去的，而現在却是例外。在門前，那個大的外國種鸚鵡在「哈囉」一聲的迎着他，進門時他再聽見一陣婢女的　笑，其後他看見那婢女正在忸怩的向後房躱避。</p>
<p>一縷香煙在由窗外綠葉中反射來的綠光中縈繞，階前血紅的玫瑰也胆大的送進濃香，還有那牆壁上少女的笑臉；一切都加深了春意的濃重。在他想，</p>
<p>「啊！少爺眞是有福氣喲！」</p>
<p>這時二少爺正對着穿衣鏡結好了領結，再匀上少許司丹康，烏黑的頭髮因此射出幽暗的光來。其後少爺發現了傳達在守候他的命令，於是他莊重的說：</p>
<p>「今天會有好些女人來，你將好看的年輕的帶來見我。假如來得太多了；總之是過了半點鐘帶一個進來，其餘的就敎她明天再來罷。」</p>
<p>「是的，少爺！我知道了。」</p>
<p>其實這傳達眞是莫明其妙。然而旣是奉了少爺的命令，就得謹愼的執行，沒有什麽好說的。可好在院子裏他看着常時侍候二少爺的丫頭從外面走來，於是他陪着笑詢問着，才知道二少爺昨天在報紙上登了啓事，要招聘一個女書記。至於少爺說要「年輕而又好看的」，於是他知道這女書記的用處了。</p>
<p>「哼丨少爺眞是會尋開心啊。」</p>
<p>當他再回到門口時，他看見一個穿裙子的女學生巳在等着他。他想；「眞快！生意就來了。」但是這第一個雖是年輕却並不如何漂亮，然而這是開張第一次，且領她去一次罷。</p>
<p>「你是來當書記的嗎？」傳達問：</p>
<p>「是的！」少女是一陣羞紅。</p>
<p>「那末見少爺去罷。」</p>
<p>等傳達第二次回来時，門前又有兩個等着。不久又進來一個。這眞糟糕，一來就是三個，領那一個先去好呢？而且裏面還有一個沒有出來。</p>
<p>「我想你們還是明天下午來罷，我們少爺還沒有起來哩。」</p>
<p>「啊？」一個個只得無精打睬的轉去。</p>
<p>可是又有年輕的漂亮的走來。接上又是飽含着眼涙的回去。只有剛好在被少爺放走的恰出門外而馬上補了上來的，才能和少爺見一見面，眞是僥倖極了。其後應徵者仍是繼續的走來，仍是繼續的出去。穿裙子的，穿旗袍的，還有穿高跟皮鞋的。年輕的，漂亮的。一直到晚上，至少在二十個開外。</p>
<p>第一天如此，第二天如此，第三天還是如此。他想：「不知道誰的運氣好，能夠在這裏得着事做。」但是一個星期之後，他却聽到二少爺房裏的丫頭說：</p>
<p>「少爺眞是開心，一天到晚有女人賠他談話；他想下個月再來一次哩！」</p>

<p>一二八滬變一起，百業停頓，尤以戰事區域一帶之商衆工廠，損失爲鉅，因是而宣告破產淸理者，不知凡幾，但間有趁此良機，故意解散，歸咎戰禍，以攫意外厚利者亦在所不免，</p>
<p>余友某君，於戰事未發前，向北四川路××西裝店定做西裝一套，及期往取，欵付淸後，始發覺有不合之處，仍請其重爲修改，豈料是夜事變發生，良久無法領取，及時局略平，復往領取，則店内諸物，巳搬運一空，惟壁上貼有告示，略謂</p>
<p>「此次戰禍，損失奇大，一切貨物均遭被刦，無法恢復，遂不得不宣告解散，幸祈原諒云云」</p>
<p>翌日，又在報上登一啓事，曰：「滬戰發生，，店内諸物，被刦一空，損失奇重，無法恢復，茲依股東會决議，即行宣告解散，所有以前諸同事，請另覓高就，勿再多費䟦涉之勞」</p>
<p>敝友以爲鴻運之蒞臨，亦惟有付之一歎而巳，不再與之計較，弗料狹路相逢，日前於法租界霞飛路，見該號巳重整旗鼓，復行營業，所異者祇於舊號之下加上　記兩字，某君憤甚，進去質問，則見不但　櫃如舊，即所有職員，亦未更動，責難良久，甚至叩椅打桌，店員乃導其往樓上尋覓，則見西裝堆積如山，終奏凱歌而還，另一友人之修理鐘錶，亦略與此同，吁！「趁火打刦」良心安在！</p>

<p>— 夢萍</p>
<p>「一二八」的上海事件發生後，閘北的華人學校都遷到「安全地域」來上課了。所謂安全地域，是指上海租界而言，無非藉外人的保護，使學校不致受戰事的影響，這件事實很痛心，現在我來講講學生的生活。</p>
<p>學生大多數寄宿校外，因爲學校不能代租多幢房子爲學生住宿。校外的生活是很自由的，非但進出不須請假，就是行動也不受訓育員的約朿。上課的時候可請人代到·整日地在外面玩，也不要緊。下午三四點鐘到公園走走，一方面可追求異性，一方面使心懷開暢。夜裏打麻雀，說是實習社交，爲將來服務社會的工具，在安全地域，賭博是很放任的，他們是不會受外界的禁止，所以盡情的賭到天亮·影戲院和跳舞塲，是他們常去的地方，什麽國難，什麽帝國主義侵略，他們是不聞問的，横豎國家</p>
<p>並不是他們個人的。</p>
<p>上面所講的固然是一部分學生的生活·但是這種情形是日益增廣，好像是傳染病一樣，由少數人傳到多數人的身上去，假使沒有打過預防針，是很難避免的。</p>
<p>編者按昨接夢萍君來稿題曰「國難期中的學生生活」學生的生活是否一部份如此現像，我不得而知，不過學生爲我國將來的主人翁，國家命運的否泰，全惟學生是賴，故披露於此，亦是有則改之，無則加勉之意。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Speculation on US-Soviet Cooperation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Recently, with the increasing deterioration of the Far Eastern situation, the voices for US-Soviet cooperation have become increasingly loud. When US Secretary of State Stimson went to Europe and met with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in Geneva, the atmosphere of the US recognizing the Soviet Union and a US-Soviet alliance became even stronger. Although the US State Department has clearly stated that the US has no intention of changing its attitude towards the Soviet Union, it is a common understanding that this is a kind of diplomatic means to create doubts before the timing is ripe, as a cover-up.</p>
<p>The US is a country where capitalism has reached a rotten stage, and it is fundamentally in a hostile camp with the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet revolution, there has been almost no relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. Even now, it is still the only major country that has not restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Now that capitalism is increasingly shaking in a difficult situation, can it really be possible for the US to cooperate with the Soviet Union, and even form a further alliance?</p>
<p>Our answer is possible. It is true that the US and the Soviet Union, due to their different national systems and political and economic systems, are fundamentally in a hostile position. However, from the perspective of the current international situation, it is not impossible for the US and the Soviet Union to cooperate temporarily under certain conditions. Why? The reasons for the US to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union are: (1) resentment of the Soviet Union for not recognizing foreign debts from the Tsarist era; (2) prevention of the Soviet Union from promoting communism; (3) fear that the lives and property of Americans residing in the Soviet Union would not be safe. Now, the first point has become a thing of the past, and the third point is an unnecessary worry. As for the second point, preventing the promotion of communism, under the Soviet Union's current defensive foreign policy, it is something it can promise. Moreover, the US, as a country with gold, is stepping into a difficult situation of decline, while the Soviet Union, as a poor household, is heading towards prosperity. The sales of American machinery and the export of products are enough to gradually reconcile the past bad impressions between the US and the Soviet Union. Although the US is still wary of the Soviet Union's "annexation" and does not dare to neglect it, international economic ties are not severed by the severance of diplomatic relations. Although the Soviet Union can export products to the US, the US can also export capital to the Soviet Union. Preventing "annexation" does not necessarily require severing diplomatic relations. If the US and the Soviet Union restore diplomatic relations, this kind of negotiation can be resolved through reasonable means. Moreover, the US Pola investigation report has proven that the Soviet Union has no behavior of oppressing workers or disturbing the market. Therefore, there are many possibilities for the US and the Soviet Union to cooperate.</p>
<p>However, the biggest root cause for the US and the Soviet Union to move towards cooperation is not here. It lies in the pressure of the deteriorating situation in the Far East. In order to maintain its commercial interests and break the spheres of influence of the great powers in the Far East, the US's foreign policy, since Hay, has been "open door and equal opportunity." The convening of the Washington Conference, the abolition of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, and the change of naval policy were all aimed at maintaining this sacred principle permanently. However, since September 18th last year, when Japan suddenly launched its power and occupied the Northeast, and January 28th this year, when it invaded our Songhu, all international treaties have become waste paper in an intangible way, and the US's foreign policy of open door and equal opportunity has also suffered a serious blow and cannot be maintained. If the US wants to compete for hegemony in the Pacific and maintain its rights and interests in the Far East, its jealousy towards Japan is naturally self-evident. And its strengthening of its military and seeking to break the situation of Japan's monopoly is even more inevitable. This is what we can grasp and understand in Stimson's letter to Pola. However, the US may not have the determination to fight Japan. The US is located too far away, and the war is quite difficult. Therefore, it would rather urge Japan to reflect diplomatically. If unfortunately it must go to war, it will inevitably need a country to contain the strong Japan. But looking around, Britain has internal worries, and France has a combination with Japan, so they cannot help each other. Only the Soviet Union itself deeply feels the threat of Japan, and its power is enough to control the strong Japan. Its being an excellent alliance is also created by the situation. This is from the perspective of the US. There are many possibilities for it to cooperate with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, in order to break the anti-Soviet united front and prevent attacks by capitalist countries, its foreign policy is also changing from offensive to defensive. If the US is willing to cooperate, it will be very welcome. The Soviet Union's Radek once published an article in the Izvestia newspaper, saying, "If someone provokes the Soviet Union, the Soviets will seek a temporary alliance with capitalist countries that do not harm their interests or infringe on their territory." It is also clear from the words that the Soviet Union is eager to cooperate with the US.</p>
<p>In summary, due to the pressure of the times, the alliance between the US and the Soviet Union will eventually come to fruition. However, as countries fundamentally in a hostile position, can the US really tolerate the existence of the Soviet Union? Conversely, can the Soviet Union really tolerate the coexistence of the US?</p>
<p>International politics are changing rapidly. Even if the US and the Soviet Union can really cooperate, it is only a very short scene in the ever-changing international politics.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Joint Committee Meets This Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Our side appoints Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing as members</p>
<p>The National Government forms a Receiving Committee for the withdrawal area</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese copies of the agreement can be signed today or tomorrow</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement has been signed, the British and American envoys have successively left Shanghai, and the Japanese army also began to withdraw yesterday. The first important task in the future is the execution of the duties of the Joint Committee. Now the members of the committee have been completely determined, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held at the US Consulate at 9:30 this morning. The second is the establishment of our Receiving Committee for the withdrawal area, and the candidates for the committee have also been determined. As for the Chinese and Japanese copies of the Armistice Agreement, due to the need to proofread and sort out the translations on both sides, and because Shigemitsu is seriously ill, the signing is still pending. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Joint Committee Meeting: According to the Joint Committee formed by the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, the committee originally planned to meet yesterday because the Japanese army had begun to withdraw from the Nanxiang area. However, it was not held because our committee members were not completely decided yesterday morning. Now our committee members have been completely determined as Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing. Therefore, the meeting will be held at the US Consulate at 9:30 this morning. At that time, the members of the six countries, China, Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, will attend. It is also heard that at the meeting this morning, in addition to discussing the monitoring methods of the Japanese army's withdrawal and the methods for Chinese police to enter after the Japanese army's withdrawal, a chairman will be elected. This chairman does not belong to China or Japan, and will probably be US Consul General Cunningham.</p>
<p>Our Candidates Determined: The candidates for the Joint Committee from Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan have been decided and seen in yesterday's newspapers. However, our country is still considering it. It is now known that after our side telegraphed the government for instructions the night before, we received a reply, appointing our personnel as Huang Qiang and Yu Hongjun. However, yesterday, Mr. Huang was quite tired from participating in the meetings for several consecutive days, and the 19th Route Army was also very busy and difficult to take care of. Therefore, he declined, and Wen Yingxing, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was appointed instead.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th Special Dispatch: According to external news, the Chinese members of the Joint Committee have been changed by the government to Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Copies: Regarding the Chinese and Japanese copies of the Armistice Agreement, the two sides have not fully agreed on the translations of terms. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, our side, Yin Rugeng and Zhang Sixu, etc., and the Japanese side, Okazaki and Horiuchi, secretaries, carefully discussed, sorted out, and corrected them at the Japanese Consulate, which has not yet been completed. It is expected that the signing will be possible today or tomorrow. If Minister Shigemitsu has not recovered by then, the Japanese will send someone to sign on his behalf.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Begins to Withdraw: According to the National News Agency, since the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the Japanese army has agreed to begin withdrawing the front-line Japanese army. From the night before yesterday to yesterday, the Japanese army that has withdrawn is as follows: On the right wing of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, all the Japanese troops in Anting and Zhengyi have withdrawn to Huangdu. In the middle, the areas of Taicang, Zhengmian, Gelong, Waigang, and Zhujiaqiao have withdrawn to Jiading. On the left wing of Taicang, the Japanese troops in the side areas of Maojiashi, Xintang, and Luduqiao have withdrawn to the area of Qianjing and Fuqiao. It is expected that all the Japanese troops will withdraw to the designated area within two weeks.</p>
<p>Formation of Receiving Committee: After the withdrawal of the Japanese army, the withdrawal area will be taken over by our side. Now the National Government has formed a Receiving Committee for the withdrawal area. The number of committee members is fixed at five, all of whom are appointed by the central government. It is internally determined that there will be two members from the Municipal Government, one from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and two from the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It is heard that the Municipal Government will be represented by Yin Rugeng, Counselor, and Wen Yingxing, Director of the Public Security Bureau; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be represented by Guo Dehua; and the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be represented by Li Mingyang and Han Deqin. Wen Yingxing has been appointed as the chairman of the committee and is actively proceeding.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech: Mayor Wu Tiecheng told reporters yesterday that regarding the handover of the area withdrawn by the Japanese army, the National Government has organized a "Receiving Committee for the withdrawal area," and specialists will take over the matter. The committee is directly under the central government, so Songhu and Jiabao are all responsible for the reception by the committee, and then handed over to the local administrative organs. The first step in the reception procedure is for the Beiping detectives to go to take over, try to restore public order, and then public affairs, public utilities, and sanitation matters can be gradually implemented. The Municipal Government authorities have organized the "Shanghai War Zone Rehabilitation Committee" because the Wusong and Zhabei areas have been most severely damaged this time, specializing in planning all post-war undertakings and planning rehabilitation procedures. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, also told reporters that the Central Government has appointed Wen Yingxing, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, as the chairman of the Receiving Committee for the withdrawal area, and is now actively preparing. It is expected that within three days, the Japanese troops in Zhabei may withdraw to the temporary station. The first batch of 500 Beiping police officers will also arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. At that time, Director Wen will lead them to take over and stand guard as usual. There are still 1,000 Beiping police officers who will be sent to Shanghai successively and assigned to the Jiangwan and Wusong areas to maintain public order.</p>
<p>Preparation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau: After the withdrawal of the Japanese army, all the defense matters will be completely taken over by the Beiping police who come to Shanghai. These police officers are directly under the Municipal Government. As for their organization, according to Wen Yingxing, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, his opinion is to still follow the previous method and divide the area into public areas 4, 5, 7, and 3, so as to restore the previous system. The candidates for each district have not yet been determined. As for all the preparation procedures for the reception, the head of the second section, Wang Zhijing, has been commissioned to plan them. The Municipal Public Security Bureau urgently needs to recover the police power in Zhabei. However, when the war broke out this time, most of the houses in the district offices of the 4, 5, and 7 districts under the bureau were destroyed by artillery fire. Therefore, the bureau specially sent inspectors Cheng, Xia, and Liao and the former director of the first branch of the seventh district, Zeng, to inspect the situation of the original bureau sites in Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Zhenru, etc. The first, second, and third branches of the fourth district can still be repaired and used. The first branch of the fifth district can barely cope with it. The general office of the fifth district has been completely destroyed because it was in the most intense battle area. The original site of the third branch of the fifth district has been demolished by the landlord. The fourth branch of the fifth district is in Yinxiang, and the fifth branch of the fifth district is in Jiangwan. They are all within the Japanese army's area, so they have not been able to go there yet. As for the seventh district general office and the first and second branches in Wusong, they have all been completely destroyed. It is also heard that the bureau will go to take over the police power next Monday.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Various Groups: After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, the United National Salvation Associations issued a declaration, waiting to study the full text of the agreement before making comments. Now the full text of the agreement has been announced, and the groups studied it separately yesterday and decided to hold an emergency meeting at 3:00 pm today to discuss how to deal with diplomatic matters.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 6th Special Dispatch: Luo Wengan issued a declaration on the Shanghai Armistice Agreement on the 6th, stating, "Since March [4th] of this year, the General Assembly of the League of Nations passed a resolution, suggesting that China and Japan negotiate a method to determine a ceasefire between the two sides, and stipulating the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The Chinese government, according to this resolution, and in the presence of representatives of participating friendly countries, negotiated the armistice agreement with the Japanese representatives, which was signed and established on the 5th of this month. This agreement stipulates that Chinese and Japanese troops in the vicinity of Shanghai should immediately cease all combat activities, and Japanese troops should immediately withdraw to the Shanghai Concession and the extra-territorial road construction in the Hongkou area, as it was before January 28th of this year. A joint committee will be formed, including representatives of participating friendly countries, to monitor the implementation of the above-mentioned provisions. The recent General Assembly of the League of Nations carefully reviewed the draft agreement between China and Japan, and unanimously passed a resolution on April 30th, stating that in accordance with the spirit of the General Assembly's resolutions of January 4th and 11th, the withdrawal of Japanese troops should be realized in the near future. The declaration also stated that the resolution of March 4th should not be regarded as fully complied with until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn. The Chinese government firmly believes that the various resolutions of the General Assembly of the League of Nations regarding the Shanghai situation, and the various provisions of the agreement signed on the 5th of this month, will be fully implemented as soon as possible. And the joint committee should pay attention to any negligence in the implementation of the agreement and the provisions in Section 11 of the April 30th resolution of the General Assembly of the League of Nations. The procedures for urging attention are also explained and interpreted by the chairman of the General Assembly of the League of Nations. Therefore, it is firmly believed that the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops to the state before January 28th of this year can be fully implemented, and there is no need for the joint committee to exercise the above-mentioned powers."</p>

<h3 id="e6">Commander Dai's Conversation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for Changing the Appointed Attendees</p>
<p>Expressing his Willingness to Sacrifice</p>
<p>Having met Commander Dai Ji at his residence and inquired about the progress of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal meeting, Commander Dai stated, "Since the League of Nations meeting resolved to limit the Japanese side to withdraw its troops, the ministers of various friendly nations came out to mediate based on this resolution, and therefore there was a meeting on the ceasefire and troop withdrawal. At first, our government heard that the Japanese side was attended by General Shirakawa, so it sent Commander-in-Chief Jiang to participate in the meeting. Later, the attendee from the Japanese side was Lieutenant General Ueda, so the government changed the appointment to me. After I was ordered, I repeatedly telegraphed to decline the appointment, but the government rebuked me for not complying. Commander Chen, Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and Commander Cai also persuaded me with public and private friendship that I should not refuse, so I attended the meeting after Vice Minister Guo. From the beginning of the war to its conclusion, everything was based on the spirit of unyielding resistance and negotiation with the Japanese side. Vice Minister Guo was extremely open-minded and engaged in resolute negotiations. The daily progress was reported to the central government for instructions at any time, and decisions were made after approval. It is misunderstood by outsiders that the nature of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal meeting is unclear, and it is suspected that this meeting contains complex political negotiations. This meeting is limited to the issue of ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and the consultations are limited to the cessation of wartime military actions by both sides, and the procedures and time for the Japanese side to withdraw its troops. The actions of our country's troops are not restricted. The agreements between the two sides have been published for public knowledge. As a soldier, resisting aggression and saving the country is my conscience and duty. Since the beginning of the war, my willingness to sacrifice for the country has been consistent."</p>
<h3 id="e7">European and American Views on the Armistice Agreement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th: The US State Department considers the Shanghai armistice treaty to be quite good and hopes that the Japanese troops will now withdraw in succession. Today's New York Times claims that the State Department expects the withdrawal of Japanese troops in Shanghai to be rapid because the three northeastern provinces continue to need Japanese troops. Reuters, London, 6th: Those in the Far East and Europe who have helped to promote the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement with action and influence are now receiving congratulations from the public. The Times believes that Guo Taiqi, Shigemitsu Aoi, and Ueda do not let their personal misfortunes hinder their purposes, which is commendable. And the British diplomacy represented by Minister Lampson is also powerful. It is too early to say that the Shanghai case has been resolved, but practical living methods have now been agreed upon, and if the international nature of this large Chinese commercial port is properly observed, commerce will certainly see prosperity again, and will be free from the obstruction of boycotters and warlords.</p>

They asked fairly detailed questions about the circumstances under which Jilin Province declared independence before other provinces after the Incident, and about Hsieh-Hsi's appointment as Minister of Finance. After the meeting, Hsieh-Hsi told people that the investigators' appearance and words were still gentle, but they were quite skeptical about the new country. It seems difficult for foreigners to understand our explanation of what important people call popular election. After a thorough explanation, they seemed to have understood a little.

(June 6th, Dentsu)</p>

Zhang replied that (1) special rights and interests in the treaty are limited to those recognized by Manchuria; (2) joint ventures are treated equally, and individual businesses are open to all; (3) regarding tariff issues, we will break away from the Republic of China and manage them in a unified manner. Salt taxes, which are secured by foreign debts, will be allocated to the Republic of China and fulfilled; (4) the industrial policy has not yet been established, and foreign investment is welcome.

<p>(Geneva) Today, Chinese chief representative Yan forwarded a telegram from the Chinese government to the League of Nations, stating that Ding Chao and Li Du are vigorously resisting the attack of large Japanese forces in the area near Yilan, 160 miles east of Harbin. Two thousand Japanese soldiers, together with troops from the puppet government, boarded six warships, ten steamships, and ten civilian boats on April 25th, setting sail from Harbin down the Songhua River to attack Yilan. In addition, a Japanese brigade is currently near Yimianpo and Zhuhe, attacking Chinese troops. (May 5th, Kuomintang Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan issued a statement on the preliminary report of the League of Nations Investigation Team on the evening of the 6th, stating that the League of Nations Investigation Team has prepared a preliminary report on the current situation in the three northeastern provinces and submitted it to the League of Nations. There are points that should be noted: the telegram conveying the report to the League of Nations was sent when the team had not stayed in Shenyang for ten days and before the team had set off to investigate other parts of the three northeastern provinces. All the military information about the three northeastern provinces obtained by the team was supplied by the Japanese military authorities. However, even according to the information supplied, it is sufficient to prove the sharp increase in Japanese troops in the eastern provinces, the spread of bandits, and the resulting loss of life, property damage, and general sense of unease in the eastern provinces since the September 18th Incident last year. According to the report, which is also recognized by the Japanese side, the rebel troops of the puppet government are currently being trained and commanded by Japanese army officers and advisors. The investigation team further pointed out that several tens of thousands of regular Chinese troops and volunteer armies are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army and other troops under Japanese control. Therefore, the preliminary report of the League of Nations Investigation Team has accurately confirmed the following facts regarding the three northeastern provinces: (1) the Japanese army has not only failed to withdraw to the railway area in accordance with the resolutions of the League of Nations Executive Council on September 30th and December 10th last year, but has also occupied the entire territory of the three northeastern provinces after the adoption of those resolutions, increasing the number of troops and actively engaging in various activities, making the situation increasingly serious; (2) the rebel army was created and supported and commanded entirely by the Japanese side; (3) the majority of the people are actively resisting Japan's seizure of power, and there will be almost no security in the northeast until the Japanese army withdraws; (4) although the Chinese government is fully prepared to fulfill its responsibilities under the above-mentioned resolutions, it is currently unable to exercise its functions in any part of the eastern provinces, including protecting life and property. What is most hoped for now is that after the League of Nations Investigation Team completes its investigation work in various parts of the eastern provinces with the assistance of Chinese representatives, it will surely discover more facts that will enable the provisions of the League of Nations resolutions to be implemented as soon as possible, and that the three northeastern provinces, which originally belonged to China, can fully restore security, and that China can fully restore its right to rule in that area.

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan met with the press at 10 PM on the 6th and reported as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Armistice Agreement</p>
<p>There has been quite a bit of criticism from the outside. However, since the beginning of the negotiations, the Japanese side has advocated convening a round table conference to discuss issues such as Shanghai's security and the abolition of military facilities, and has promoted issues such as the so-called establishment of a free port, the expansion of concessions, and the establishment of a buffer zone. In addition, issues such as boycotting Japanese goods and using anti-Japanese textbooks have been broken down by our side, step by step, and it has been determined that the ceasefire conference will only discuss troop withdrawals and will not involve politics. The Japanese side also proposed stopping the activities of plainclothes teams, both sides using aircraft for reconnaissance, and protecting the lives, property, and businesses of Japanese residents as conditions for their withdrawal. All these points have been strongly debated by our side, and the Japanese side has finally abandoned its demands. The Japanese side initially requested a very wide range of troops stationed, but after repeated disputes, the temporary stationing location was reduced. The Japanese side also raised the issue of Chinese troops stationed in Pudong and south of the Suzhou River, but after repeated efforts to reject it, they no longer mentioned it. Although this ceasefire agreement has not been able to make them withdraw completely immediately, judging from the current international situation and domestic conditions, the negotiation process has really been exhausted. Now that the Shanghai issue has come to an end, the Ministry can use its full energy to deal with the Eastern issue, which is the fundamental issue of the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>(2) Sino-Russian Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>The Ministry has been studying this issue for a long time, and has paid more attention to this issue recently due to the tense relations between Russia and Japan. It is heard that our side also has high hopes for the resumption of diplomatic relations. However, according to reports, the Soviet Union has recently shown great discourtesy to our delegation to the Russian conference, and they also intend to recognize the puppet government as the counterpart for business contacts. All these actions are enough to hinder the resumption of diplomatic relations. (June 6th, Special Dispatch)</p>

After the Japanese military police detained the Russians, they were interrogated in the Japanese Consulate prison in Harbin and then handed over to the "Manchukuo" detective team. The police prohibited newspapers from publishing this matter, but the detained Russians did refuse to eat in protest of this inhumane interrogation. The Russian Consul General in Harbin has lodged a protest, saying that innocent Russians have been arrested and subjected to torture, forcing them to confess to imaginary crimes, which is an attempt to harm relations between Soviet Russia and Manchuria. (May 5th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Struck by Three Bullets, Life Hangs by a Thread</p>
<p>The Assailant, a Russian, Captured on the Spot</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 6th - French President Doumer was visiting an exhibition today when, as he was about to enter the venue, an assailant suddenly fired five shots at the President's carriage. Three bullets struck the President. The other two struck Paul Ang, who was accompanying the President, and Chief of the Paris Police, Chiasse. The Governor of the Seine, Lerna, bravely stepped forward, seized the assailant's weapon, and sent the President to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. The assailant is a Russian named Gogulov, a medical doctor. He has been handed over to the Chief of the Police Station in the Roer district of Paris for custody. Prime Minister Tardieu and Interior Minister Mahaut both visited the President's bedside to inquire about his condition. The President's injuries are critical, and his survival is doubtful. Doumer was formerly the President of the Senate. In May of last year, he and Briand were both presidential candidates. As a result of the competition, Mr. Doumer was elected President.</p>
<h3 id="e67">French President Doumer <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 6th - French President Doumer was shot this afternoon, struck by three bullets. The first bullet penetrated his neck, the second his chest, and the third his abdomen. His injuries are severe. He was immediately taken to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. After the incident, the police immediately arrested a Russian man, said to be the shooter. The man identified himself at the police station as Gogulov, but his statements were extremely erratic. The authorities suspect he is mentally ill. The incident occurred in the corridor between the first and second reception rooms of the home of the famous banker Rothschild, as the President was personally attending the opening ceremony of "Book Week". The assailant fired shots so quickly that by the time people rushed to help, he had already fired three shots. The Chairman of the Writers' Alliance, Van Ler, was the first to jump forward, grab the assailant, and try to seize his gun. But the assailant fired another shot, hitting Van in the upper arm. Van's hand loosened, and the assailant was immediately stripped and ran outward. The Chief of the Paris Police chased closely behind. The assailant continued to fire shots repeatedly, injuring the Police Chief's wrist. Finally, the assailant tried to fire again, but several people jumped on him simultaneously, knocking him down. He still made a final struggle. Just then, a servant summoned the constables to the scene, and they escorted the assailant out of the house. Since the incident, the people inside the house had been shouting to catch the assailant and administer private justice, so everyone wanted to keep the assailant to beat him first. At that time, although the President was struck by three bullets, he was initially able to stand upright, but later he fell into the arms of the Minister of National Defense, Bidreli Enfen, General Lu Bai, and his family member, Li Qin, and was immediately sent to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. It is said that his injuries are extremely serious and there is very little hope of recovery. At 4:10 PM, the attending physician issued an official report stating that his condition was extremely critical. Later, as a last resort, a blood transfusion was performed at 4:20 PM. During the transfusion, the President mumbled deliriously, his tone weak, and his words were incoherent, indicating the severity of his illness. Before the blood transfusion, doctors had tried hard to stop the bleeding from the wound, but to no avail. There was a discussion to remove the bullets from the chest and abdomen, but it was feared that this would increase the danger, so it was decided to perform the blood transfusion first. After the case occurred, Prime Minister Tardieu and other cabinet members immediately rushed to the hospital to visit the President's bedside. The people waiting for news in front of the hospital and in front of the Presidential Palace were standing full.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 5th - A plot to assassinate Spanish Prime Minister Aznar had recently been discovered in the Spanish capital.

According to their confessions, the scope of the assassination plot was extremely large. In addition to the President and Prime Minister, several other cabinet members were also on the assassination list, with the intention of wiping them out in one fell swoop and establishing a new government with a conservative and autocratic character.

Two guards who were defending the railway tracks were killed, and three others were seriously injured.

<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 6th - After the Austrian cabinet resigned en masse this morning, the President accepted the resignation and instructed them to continue to serve as usual until a new cabinet is formed. The current leading candidate to succeed as Prime Minister is Mr. Dofus, leader of the Christian Social Party and current Minister of Agriculture in the outgoing cabinet. This party is currently the largest party in Austria and also holds great power in the outgoing cabinet. It is said that if Mr. Dofus is appointed to form a cabinet, he will ask the German National Party for assistance, but only if that party abandons its demand to appoint Dr. Scobot as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 6th - The Austrian Social Party and others demanded the dissolution of Parliament due to the recent results of elections in various provinces and cities, so the cabinet has already resigned. According to previous statements by Prime Minister Boleslavsky, if Parliament passes a motion to dissolve, he intends to request emergency powers, and if he does not obtain them, he intends to resign immediately. The cabinet was formed in June of last year and has served for ten and a half months.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 5th - According to reports from Ankara, the capital of Turkey, as a result of the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to the Soviet Union, Turkey may adopt several prominent aspects of the Soviet system in the future, but this does not imply recognition of communist ideals. It is said that after Turkish Prime Minister Ismet arrived in Russia, he was greatly impressed by the effectiveness of various Soviet industrial trusts and deeply wished to adopt their system within his own country. It is reported that it has been decided that when Ismet and others return to Turkey, they will leave several attendants in Russia to conduct a detailed investigation of all Soviet systems. A preliminary plan has already been drawn up to establish various monopolies and chain cooperative stores. In the future, employees of chain stores and all government officials will receive only a quarter of their original salary, with the remainder being replaced by vouchers for cooperative stores.</p>
<h3 id="e72">At the Disarmament Conference, Various Countries Vie for Advantage <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Japan and France Oppose Abolishing Submarines</p>
<p>Compromise on Disputed Points Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Said...</p>
<p>Has the Human Heart Not Yet Suppressed War?</p>
<p>Those Who Heard Were Astonished</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 5th - The Naval Committee of the International Disarmament Conference has been discussing naval offensive weapons in open debates for several days, but has still been unable to reach an agreement. It finally adopted the Chairman's suggestion to have each representative discuss the results privately and submit them to a closed-door meeting on Saturday morning. However, under the current circumstances, it is feared that the points of contention will still be difficult to compromise at that time. In today's debate, Italian representative Servoni first proposed a resolution advocating the abolition of battleships and submarines. Next, the Polish and Japanese representatives both advocated retaining submarines, calling them purely defensive weapons. The U.S. representative strongly denounced submarines as threats to merchant ships and hazards to civilians. Next, the German representative vigorously argued for the abolition of naval mines, saying that the Treaty of Versailles had already prohibited Germany from possessing them, which proves that they are offensive tools. However, the Italian and British representatives both strongly argued that naval mines are defensive weapons for attacking submarines and should be placed in the category of defensive weapons. Since each country is considering its own interests, everyone wants to retain the advantages of its own navy and deprive others of their advantages, how can one expect them to agree?</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 5th - U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, Swanson, spoke to the Naval Committee of the General Assembly today on the issue of submarines, saying that submarines must be abolished, otherwise the United States reserves the right to build submarines with the same strength as any other country, and to build large submarines with ample cruising range needed by the United States in the Pacific. France and Japan firmly stated that submarines are harmless offensive and defensive tools, but he still remembers that responsible politicians and world public opinion once denounced submarines, but now they are considered extremely valuable national defense tools. Why is it that the human heart forgets the horrors of war so quickly? The United States is willing to accept the abolition of submarines, but if other countries do not agree to abolish them, then there is no need to change submarines, because long-range submarines are needed by the Philippines and Hawaii. After the U.S. representative made this statement, those who heard it looked at each other in astonishment.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 6th - The Naval Committee of the International Disarmament Conference has been discussing for ten days, engaging in unprecedented verbal battles over battleships, aircraft carriers, and submarines. Each representative has vigorously defended the warships valued by his country, calling them "strictly defensive" instruments, which has only complicated the fundamental question of deciding which are offensive and which are defensive warships. And according to the rules of the conference, a resolution can only be passed by unanimous agreement. Therefore, the current approach is only to report each country's contradictory attitude towards each type of warship to the General Committee. Summarizing the debates of the past ten days, only the United Kingdom and the United States call aircraft carriers strictly defensive instruments. Conversely, countries such as France and the Netherlands believe that if the aircraft they carry are not limited to reconnaissance aircraft, then they are indeed offensive weapons. Furthermore, Japan, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Turkey vigorously claim that aircraft carriers are naturally offensive tools. Opinions on submarines are the most divided. Germany vigorously advocates complete abolition. The United States argues that if they can be completely abolished, that is the best, otherwise it will be difficult to limit the minimum tonnage. The UK, Turkey, and Sweden are willing to limit them to the minimum tonnage. China, Italy, and Spain all say that if battleships are abolished, submarines can also be abolished. Japan, France, Norway, and Poland firmly insist that submarines are naturally defensive weapons. The Committee is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting on Saturday to prepare a report on the various contradictory claims, and after obtaining unanimous agreement from the meeting, submit it to the General Committee.</p>

Therefore, he advocated solving the reparations problem, reducing armaments, and restoring the silver price before 1925. If this is not done, there can be no hope of restoring economic prosperity. Borah also criticized the current uneven distribution of gold, saying that the United States and France now hold most of the world's gold, thus creating an extraordinary situation, and all countries are suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Ma Zhanshan's Troops Advance to Hu-Hai Railway <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Jilin Troops Concentrated Under Ma's Orders</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Dig Trenches at Songpu Station</p>
<p>Hu-Hai Vehicles Taken by Ma</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - The Hu-Hai Railway has been blocked since April 28th. Residents along the railway line have been moving to Harbin in recent days. Merchants and residents of Songpu Town, separated from Harbin City by a river, have also moved away, and all houses are nailed shut. Employees and road workers at Majiachuan Station on the Hu-Hai Railway and Songpu Station mostly hide elsewhere at night and only go to the station during the day to check. Gao Yunkun, the former General Manager of the Hu-Hai Railway Bureau, took leave to go to Fula Erji due to his mother's illness. The puppet state's Ministry of Transportation reassigned Chang Zunyi to take over. Chang is the younger brother of Chang Bingyi, the current Director of the Shanxi Agriculture and Mining Department. He obtained this position through contact with the Japanese. He originally planned to take over on the 29th, but did not dare to go to the bureau due to the disruption of transportation. The affairs of the Hu-Hai Railway Bureau at Songpu Station are currently temporarily maintained by the original Director of the General Affairs Department, Dou. However, most of the employees have gone to Hailun, and there is nothing to do. It is just a nominal position. On the morning of the 29th, two groups of Japanese troops got off the train from the Miaotaizi Station on the Chinese Eastern Railway and went to Songpu Station. The first group, about one company, dug trenches near the East Factory of the station. The second group, transferred from the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway, consisted of about 2,000 people and planned to go to Hulan by train. Because Songpu Station only had 15 freight cars and no locomotives, they did not go and stayed at the station. This traffic interruption was unexpected by the Japanese. Ma Zhanshan's troops, the Cai Hongyou Brigade, arrived in Suihua from eastern Heilongjiang under Ma's orders. On the morning of the 28th, the Lu Tuan of the brigade also led a battalion of soldiers and drove a special train to Songpu Station. They immediately showed Ma's order to mobilize employees to Hailun to work to maintain the property of the Hu-Hai Railway. All locomotives and freight cars were completely driven to Hailun. The Railway Bureau also moved to Hailun. Employees who were willing to go would go, otherwise they would be suspended. At that time, the employees heard that 19 were willing to go with the army. The passenger and freight vehicles parked at the station were completely coupled into a train, which departed for Hulan at about 10:00 AM. Before the train departed, a stationmaster refused to issue a road permit because he had not received an order from the director, and was immediately shot by the Lu Tuan. By noon, there was no one left in the Hu-Hai Railway Bureau. At that time, the Japanese troops in Harbin heard the news and were about to cross the river to pursue, but the telegraphic communication between the north and south of the river was cut off by the Lu Tuan in advance, and the situation there was unknown. The Japanese troops did not dare to rush in. On the morning of the 29th, the Japanese troops finally learned the truth and feared that Ma's troops would attack and enter Harbin. They hurriedly sent troops to Songpu to set up defenses. On the morning of the 29th at 5:00 AM, a passenger train departed from the Hulan Bureau and drove to Majiachuan Station. When they heard that the Japanese troops were crossing the river, they returned to Hulan without stopping. In the afternoon, traffic between Hulan and Songpu, except for trains, was not available even by horse-drawn carriage. Harbin merchants were extremely panicked and closed the market early. The Xi Qia military police Second Brigade, Li Wenbing's unit, stationed in Harbin, and the Japanese troops deployed defenses in the suburbs of Harbin, including Yuanjia Wopeng, Huangshan Zuzi, and Sanke Shu. The situation was extremely tense. Currently, the vanguard of Ma's troops, the Cai Hongyou Brigade, is at Xujia Station and Zhangshiyingdian on the Hu-Hai Railway, 20 miles away from the vanguard of the Japanese troops at Songpu Station. Both sides are taking defensive positions and have not yet engaged in fighting. Traffic between Hulan and Hailun is still normal for freight and passenger cars. The workers transferred from Songpu are all gathered in Hulan to serve. Recently, the Hei troops Wu Songlin and Pu Datong have been ordered by Ma to concentrate in Keshan and Baiquan. At the same time, the passenger and freight cars on the Qiqihar Railway were also reportedly mobilized by Ma's team to Taian Town on the 28th. The Tahar Railway Bridge has been blown up. The Japanese Amano Brigade stationed in Heilongjiang is defending the Longjiang Station on the Qiqihar line outside the city. The Japanese troops seem to be planning to wait for the arrival of the new 8th and 9th Divisions before launching an attack on Ma's troops. Ma has recently been making great efforts to recruit various rebel forces and has also ordered the local militias to concentrate in Baiquan, Wangkui, and Hailun to await orders. The rebel force of Li Qingshan, which was dispatched from Harbin for a long time, has also been reorganized by Ma into the 4th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which are currently being organized in Shitouchengzi. In the future, it is still planned to dispatch troops to Nongan and Changchun to remotely control the Japanese troops coming from the north. (April 29th)</p>

<p>Treaties with China Still Apply to Manchuria</p>
<p>The Kobe News reports that a member of the British House of Commons questioned the Manchurian State treaty issue. Minister of Commerce Walter Lansiman replied that existing treaties with China still apply to Manchuria as before. Under the current circumstances, there is no need to consider the so-called issue of concluding a special commercial treaty with the Manchurian State government.</p>

<p>Delusional Thinking That Various Countries Will Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun says that the Manchurian State government has close ties with international financial and economic affairs and has to promote the recognition of advanced European and American countries. However, in order to seek the recognition of various countries, the situation in Manchuria must first be understood by various countries. The current government has sent many unofficial diplomatic representatives to Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and Japan to communicate in order to increase political and economic relations with various countries.</p>

<p>Regarding the Bridge Bombing and Train Crash Incidents</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published a commentary on April 30, pointing out that Russia's actions were illegal. It read: According to a dispatch from Harbin, the major incidents in the past, such as the bombing of the Second Songhua River Railway Bridge and the overturning of military trains, were planned by Constantin Kettenfeld, Secretary of the General Affairs Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Staff Member Skripin, and other railway officials. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs investigated the evidence, it immediately lodged a serious protest. In view of such actions, we consider them to be extremely illegal. Remembering Article 9 of the Sino-Russian Treaty of 1924 (Republic of China Year 13) and Article 1 of the Russian-Fengtian Agreement of the same year, the railway is purely a commercial enterprise, and all rights other than business belong to China. Russia only has a business relationship. Therefore, Russia should not use any policy on the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to Article 6 of the Sino-Russian Treaty, Russia is not allowed to engage in revolutionary and propaganda activities on the railway. Now Russia has violated the treaty and conspired a Manchurian communization plan. As for the recent atrocities, they are almost sufficient to represent the policy of the Soviet Russian central government. Since the Manchurian Incident occurred on September 18 last year, the various statements made by Soviet Russian leaders have revealed anti-Japanese tendencies in their attitudes towards the Japanese army. Therefore, our country, in order to eliminate such worries, should take decisive measures.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Commemoration of the May Third Incident in Jinan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Amidst Bitter Winds and Rain</p>
<p>Doubly Presenting a Tragic Atmosphere</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Time flies, and years pass like flowing water. Today marks the fourth anniversary of the May Third Massacre. The people of Jinan, having personally experienced the devastation of artillery fire, hold a particularly solemn memorial service every year on this day to show they will never forget. On this day, the entire city flies flags at half-mast to express grief. All schools hold memorial meetings. Schools above the secondary level suspend classes for one day. Various newspapers publish special editions, featuring photos of the May Third Massacre. The Provincial Party Headquarters prints commemorative booklets of the May Third Massacre, along with letters to compatriots and comrades, to arouse the attention of all sectors. It also convenes representatives from all sectors in the Party Headquarters auditorium to hold a memorial meeting. At the time, the sky is gloomy and overcast, with a fine drizzle. The whole of Jinan presents a tragic atmosphere. More than a thousand representatives from all sectors arrive. In the center of the auditorium are placed the memorial tablets of Martyr Cai Gongshi and the comrades who died in the May Third Incident. The meeting place is also silent and without sound, very different from ordinary meetings. The chairman is Zhang Weicun, the Provincial Rectification Committee member. After opening the meeting as scheduled, the entire assembly bows three times to the memorial tablets of the martyrs who died in the May Third Incident. Then Zhang Weicun reports on the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that today is the fourth anniversary of the May Third Massacre. However, in the four years since, internal strife has not ceased, and the revenge for the May Third Incident has not been taken. The tragedies of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident have followed one after another. As of now, the severity of the domestic situation is unprecedented in history. He hopes that everyone will unite to wash away the national shame, and especially hopes that young students will cultivate their knowledge to serve the country in the future. Then representatives give speeches, and finally disperse after shouting slogans. (May 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Alarming News from Northern Guangdong <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Chen and Zhao's Troops Mutiny in Pingshi</p>
<p>Li Mingrui's Forces Suddenly Invade Renhua</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the loss of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian, the Guangdong army has planned to transfer the Third Army under Li Yangjing, the First Independent Division under Huang Renyu, the Second Independent Division under Zhang Ruigui, and parts of the Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the Second Army, to defend the Fujian-Guangdong border. These troops are deployed in a long, snaking line stretching north from Sannan on the Jiangxi border, winding through Xunwu, Jiaoling, Lianping, Heping, Pingyuan, Dabu, and Meixian, maintaining close vigilance while temporarily holding their positions to await an opportunity before making further advances. Consequently, Yu Hanmou, the overall commander of the aid to Jiangxi, is currently stationed in Ganzhou, and Li Yangjing, the overall commander of the aid to Fujian, remains in Dabu. However, as the majority of the Guangdong army has advanced to southern Jiangxi and the Fujian border, the defenses of the Northern and Eastern Rivers have been somewhat relaxed, allowing miscellaneous troops and local communists to take advantage of the situation. Recently, Chen Tiejian and Zhao Zixin from southern Hunan suddenly rebelled in the name of demanding supplies, occupying Pingshi and Lechang in the Northern River to restrain the Guangdong army entering southern Jiangxi. It is known that Chen and Zhao's brigades were recruited by Tang Shengzhi when the Southwest Extraordinary Conference was held. Not long after, Tang left, and Chen and Zhao's troops were reorganized under Chen Jitang's First Army Group, with Pingshi and Yizhang designated as the defense areas for the two brigades. Recently, for unknown reasons, a mutiny suddenly occurred, with signs of invading Renhua and Lechang. The Guangdong authorities immediately transferred He Baoshu's Second Regiment of Chen Hanguang's brigade, stationed in the Northern River, from Shaoguan to Pingshi to intercept the rebels. On April 27th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the rebel soldiers. To increase its forces, Chen's brigade redeployed Chen Yuguang's First Regiment to Lechang to assist in the suppression, and dispatched Peng Zhifang's Third Regiment from Xiaobeijiang to Lianxian to cut off the enemy's rear. After arriving in Lianxian, Peng's troops, together with Li Kangxiu's Third Regiment of Chen Zhang's Second Independent Brigade, went straight to Xingzi to intercept Zhao Zixin and Gong Hao's forces. Chen Hanguang returned to Lechang from Shaoguan on the 28th to command the operation. By the end of last month, the rebel soldiers in Pingshi were driven back. Unexpectedly, more than two thousand of these rebel soldiers retreated to southern Hunan and joined forces with Li Mingrui's communist bandit forces from southern Jiangxi, launching a surprise attack on Renhua County from Guidong and other places in southern Hunan. Earlier, on the 24th, about a thousand local communists had gathered within Renhua County, occupying Changjiangwei in Renhua County. Changjiangwei is located between Nanxiong and Renhua, and the situation is quite tense. Yuan's battalion of the defense army stationed in Renhua dispatched two companies of soldiers to suppress them. By this time, the bandit forces had already occupied Muxitou, Zhou Cave, and other places. When the government troops arrived, they engaged the bandits, but due to their weak forces, they were defeated and retreated. With the loss of Changjiangwei, Renhua County was shaken and repeatedly sent urgent reports. Chen Zhang's Second Independent Brigade stationed in Nanxiong redeployed Du Fengfei's regiment to encircle and suppress the bandits. However, Du's regiment suffered more than a hundred casualties, including over ten platoon leaders and six or seven company commanders, and still failed. Currently, the province is redeploying Luo Cequn's First Regiment of Miao Peinan's Training Division, which arrived in Shaoguan on the 30th to strengthen the defense, so that Chen Hanguang's troops can be transferred from Shaozhou and Lechang to Renhua to suppress Li's bandits. Currently, the bandit forces have spread from Changjiangwei to Chengkou, and Renhua County is under pressure from both directions. Merchants and residents in the area are fleeing in droves. It is reported that He's regiment of Chen's brigade and a part of the First Regiment had arrived in Renhua on the 28th, dividing into several routes to encircle and suppress the bandits in Chengkou and Changjiang.

<h3 id="e85">Opening of the Jiangxi Province Bandit Suppression Conference <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui Delivers Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Strongly Criticizing the Jiangxi People for Being Too Useless</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, communist bandits have spread in Jiangxi, now almost all over the province. To understand the details of communist bandits in various places, so that military, political, financial construction, and relief efforts can develop a comprehensive and precise suppression plan, the provincial government convened a bandit suppression conference. A total of 120 representatives were publicly elected from 81 counties, and the provincial government invited more than 40 people, including Li Liejun, Zhang Dingfan, Tang Yi, Xie Yuanhan, Kong Shaoyao, and Zhou Guanhong. More than 180 proposals and more than 40 county bandit suppression reports have been received and included in the agenda. The meeting is scheduled to last ten days, and the opening ceremony will be held on May 4th in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters. 119 members including Kong Shaoyao and Jiang Dajie attended the meeting, and more than 100 guests including He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, attended. All members of the provincial government, directors of various departments, the president of the High Court, and the director of the Highway Administration were also present. The meeting opened at around 10 a.m., chaired by Xiong Shihui. After the ceremony, Xiong Shihui delivered an opening speech, stating that in the past six or seven years, communist bandits have burned, killed, robbed, and plundered in Jiangxi, affecting as many as 70 of the 81 counties. The loss of life and property of the people is incalculable. The reason why the situation has reached such an incurable point is not, as outsiders say, how formidable Zhu and Mao are, or that the bandits have three heads and six arms, but that the people of Jiangxi themselves are not formidable enough and are too useless. Even the current atmosphere of terror, as if it were a big deal, is created by corrupt troops, greedy officials, and scholars who are neither one thing nor another. When corrupt troops arrive at the front, they retreat without fighting and flee at the mere sight of the enemy, claiming how formidable the bandits are and how amazing Zhu and Mao are, to cover up their crime of not fighting, being afraid of death, and being useless. Greedy officials scrape the land bare and then hope for the bandits to come, so that they can falsely report losses and run away with the money. Scholars who are neither one thing nor another say how Zhu and Mao understand doctrine and how they gain the support of the people. In fact, Zhu and Mao are both uneducated and unskilled, and not qualified to talk about doctrine. The target of communism is big capital. To talk about communism in China today is like wearing fur in summer and linen in winter. Therefore, the current atmosphere of everyone being seen as a soldier is all due to mediocre people disturbing themselves and lacking the determination to save themselves. Local officials, gentry, and even ordinary people in the province all have a mentality of following the old ways, being negligent, relying on others, and being biased, which has led to the communist bandits becoming strong and out of control. Instead of blaming themselves for being useless, they elevate the bandits too high, which is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, in the future, we must eliminate all the previous atmosphere of decadence and laziness, and rise up together to save ourselves. Even dozens of Zhu and Mao are not to be feared. Then He Yingqin gave instructions, briefly stating that when the large-scale suppression of bandits was carried out last year, it was originally hoped that all the bandits could be eliminated. However, due to the influence of the situation, inconvenient transportation, poor local politics, and the people being like a heap of loose sand, the communist bandits were able to rise from the ashes, which is truly regrettable. However, after Zhu and Mao suffered a major defeat in Xingguo last year, they advocated fleeing to Hunan and Fujian, and opinions were divided. In addition, lower-level cadres from the Jiangxi and Hunan factions killed each other, and the number of those who came to surrender with their weapons increased day by day. Recently, in the battle of Ganzhou, the remaining communist bandits were severely damaged again, and they fled in three directions: one to southern Fujian, one to the Hunan-Guangdong border, and one to remain in the old nest in southeastern Jiangxi. This time, when Guangdong and Guangxi sent troops, Comrades Li Delin and Chen Bonan both wanted me to take on the task of commander-in-chief of the three provinces' bandit suppression, and the command is unified. In the past, the bandit suppression troops were affected by the situation, and their efforts fell short. Now, the Southwest is extremely supportive of the central government. When I was in Luoyang, I heard that Comrade Yan Baichuan also earnestly admonished his subordinate generals to unite in suppressing bandits and resisting Japan, and to point their guns outward. Therefore, at this moment, we can concentrate on suppressing bandits and will no longer be affected by the overall situation. However, relying solely on the army to suppress bandits is not effective, and suppressing small groups still requires party affairs and politics. What should be noted in the future is (1) improving politics to eliminate the source of bandits, (2) improving transportation to benefit the army and develop production, and (3) organizing the people to enable them to defend themselves, with the basic work being to check household registration and manage the baojia system. For example, the reason why Peng's bandits did not dare to enter southern Hunan when they fled into Rucheng this time was due to the power of the local militias. In addition, regarding military matters, it is not convenient to announce. What can be announced is that in the future, the areas where bandits are active will be divided into several zones, and each zone will be the responsibility of one person to suppress and eliminate them within a time limit, to avoid shirking responsibility. Then Wang Guanying delivered a speech on behalf of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Wu Zongci delivered a reply on behalf of the members. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon. (April 5th)</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The bandit problem in western Anhui has been spreading more and more widely recently. After Chen Diaoyuan stepped down from his post in Anhui, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs ordered Chen to handle the bandit suppression affairs in Anhui, with specific responsibilities. After receiving the order, Chen moved the headquarters from Anqing to Bengbu and went to Hefei to supervise the suppression. He convened a bandit suppression conference in Hefei to coordinate with friendly forces and launch a large-scale joint suppression in order to achieve success in one fell swoop. Currently, the bandit suppression troops include the 46th Division of Yue Shengxuan, the 55th Division of Ruan Zhaochang, the 57th Division of Li Songshan, the 7th Division of Wang Jun, the 12th Division of Zeng Wanzhong, and several aircraft. Today (3rd), Hefei sent four large and small wheeled tugboats carrying over a hundred wounded soldiers to Wuhu for treatment at the Fifth Rear Hospital. The intensity of the bandit suppression war can be imagined. According to military sources, the bandit army has suffered heavy casualties in recent days, and the bandit suppression army has been advancing steadily. They have reached Sujiabu and established contact with Wang Fanqing's brigade, destroying the bandit nest at Pinggangkou. In this battle, about two hundred bandits were killed, and the main bandit force fled towards the border of Henan and Hubei. The various armies are still in pursuit. It is reported that Chen plans to move the headquarters from Bengbu to Hefei for the convenience of command. (May 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Zhejiang People Rise Up in Opposition to Tax Increases <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to increase the business tax rate from 2/1000 to 10/1000, ordering the various business tax collection bureaus under the Finance Department to comply. However, the tax payments for the spring term will still be collected according to the original tax rate. The revised tax rate is scheduled to be implemented from April onwards. The people of Zhejiang believe that this tax increase is no different from a disguised likin tax. The silk industry in Hangzhou was the first to oppose it, sending telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting the Zhejiang Provincial Government to withdraw the order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. Currently, the new pharmaceutical industry, the electrical machinery industry, the silk weaving industry, and others have successively submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>Cancel the heavy business tax rate. It is also reported that the Provincial Federation of Commerce also telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating that commerce, at this critical juncture, cannot bear the heavy tax burden, and requested that the proposal be canceled to save the merchants and people of Zhejiang. On one hand, Wang Zhuzhai of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan to protect the spirit of legislation, requesting that, like the postage increase case, an inquiry be raised to the Executive Yuan.

<p>Huayang Bridge Robbery Case: Last night (5th) at around 9 p.m., more than ten bandits speaking a Hakka dialect came to Huayang Bridge in the eastern suburbs of Songjiang County, carrying knives and guns, intending to rob. They first cut off the telephone lines connecting the city and the suburbs, and sent people to guard both the east and west ends. Then, they opened the gate of Zhang Jingen's house, swarmed inside, and searched wantonly. After about a dozen minutes, they took the loot and went down to the countryside, leaving triumphantly. After checking the losses, it was found that gold ornaments, cash, and other items worth about 200 yuan were robbed. The police were immediately notified to investigate and pursue them, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Military Commission Secretly Investigates Accusation: Last month, Jiangyin was ordered to rush to build rear defense projects. Cai Zhongwei, the captain of the Fourth Team of the Engineer Training Department of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, led more than ten soldiers to direct the work in Houteng, the second district. Due to a certain issue, Captain Cai took the opportunity to cause trouble. On April 7th, he slapped Shen Xi, the district chief of the district, three times. After mediation, he demanded a reward fee of 200 yuan from the district chief, and the matter was settled. When the matter was heard by a certain director of the Protection Committee Office, he telegraphed Military Commission Chairman Chiang and Executive Yuan President Wang in his capacity as a former subordinate and citizen, requesting a thorough investigation and strict punishment to maintain the reputation of revolutionary soldiers. It is now learned that Chairman Chiang has personally ordered Dai Li, a staff officer of the headquarters, to go to Cheng to investigate secretly. He arrived in Cheng on the 2nd and secretly investigated the truth from all sides. He also went to the brigade headquarters of the Second Brigade of the First Division and summoned County Magistrate Ma Zhen and District Chief Shen Xi to conduct detailed inquiries. It is said that he has gained some clues. Dai left Cheng for Wuxi at noon yesterday (3rd) and returned to Nanjing to report.</p>
<p>Recruiting Female Workers Arouses Repercussions: Wuxi Correspondence: The Ganshen Silk Factory under Gongyun Bridge is operated by Cheng Bingruo from the county. It has a total of twenty-two silk reeling machines. Last year, due to the sluggish silk market and stagnant exports, it was shut down in the winter. Recently, Factory Owner Cheng, in light of the impending resolution of the Sino-Japanese armistice and the improving silk market, originally planned to restart eight machines on the 2nd of this month, but he was very dissatisfied with the old female workers and planned to re-recruit new female workers. The established conditions are: 1. Height should be 4 feet 3 inches. 2. Eyesight should be able to see 16 feet away. 3. The mouth should be toothless and complete. 4. Age should be from 16 to 26 years old. 5. Eloquence should be fluent. 6. Qualifications should be experienced and have worked in factories with complete equipment. 7. The family must not be pregnant or have children. However, there are very few who meet the qualifications. The personnel in charge of the examination in the factory paid particular attention to the female workers' beautiful appearance and fashionable clothing. Female workers with beautiful faces are easily accepted, while those who are slightly ugly have no hope of being qualified. After hearing the news, the old female workers of the factory and the female workers of various factories came out to negotiate and submitted a request to the labor union to forward it to the party and government authorities for relief.</p>
<p>Nanhui Rural Robbers Injure People: The family of Chen Jisheng, a kiln owner in Xiaoguan, about three miles northeast of Nanhui in Jiaxing, was suddenly attacked by two robber boats the night before last. More than twenty robbers broke into the house, tied up and tortured Jisheng, and forced him to hand over his property. Then they tied up and beat his sister and burned her with fire, causing blisters all over her body, which was unbearable to see. The robbers searched and robbed for a long time before leaving triumphantly. Although the injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment, her injuries were quite serious, and there are concerns about her life.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Provincial Highway to be Completed by a Deadline: Fengxian Correspondence: The Shanghai-Hangzhou Provincial Highway has been planned by the Construction Department.

<h3 id="e89">Chen Youren Criticizes the Armistice Agreement <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Pay Attention to Yoshizawa's Congratulations to Guo Taiqi</p>
<p>Declaring the Return to Normalcy is Not Just Military</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren made the following comments yesterday on the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement: Is the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement signed on the 5th of this month a victory for China or a victory for Japan? I think the first thing to pay attention to is the following two facts: (1) According to foreign reports, this agreement was originally scheduled to be signed on Monday, May 2nd, but the Japanese requested that it be changed to May 5th. This day is the eleventh anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's establishment of the revolutionary government in Guangzhou. (2) Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa congratulated Vice Minister Guo Taiqi in Tokyo for the signing of this agreement. Naturally, no one would congratulate their enemy on defeating them. These two facts show that the Japanese have recognized that the result of this agreement is a victory for the Japanese. Furthermore, whether we look at the general principles or the detailed clauses of this agreement, I think the Japanese have good reason to recognize this agreement as a symbol of the victory of Japanese policy. Why? Everyone knows that the territory of the Republic of China is completely indivisible. This means that if an enemy invades a part of China (such as Manchuria), it is invading the entire China. That is why the Chinese people insist that the issue of the three northeastern provinces and the issue of Shanghai must be resolved as the same issue. This is the consensus of all Chinese people, and the leader of the Nanjing government, Mr. Wang, has also declared it. But what is the result of this agreement? The Nanjing government and those naive diplomats think that the Shanghai armistice agreement is only a temporary agreement on military issues, and will not involve political issues. Naturally, it will not violate the unity and integrity of the national territory. But is that the case? When a part of country A's territory is invaded by country B, and country A and country B actually sign an agreement for a temporary truce in another part of their territory, while the rest of the territory is still under enemy invasion, isn't this clearly tearing apart the unity and integrity of their own territory? Isn't the so-called "only resolving military issues and not involving politics" just self-deception? There is another level. According to the Lytton Report, the most important point is that it points out that the three northeastern provinces have been in a state of extreme turmoil for seven months since Japan occupied them. The Japanese declaration was originally that the reason they sent troops to occupy the three northeastern provinces was to maintain the治安 of the three northeastern provinces. Now, what can the Japanese say? The League of Nations investigation team has pointed out that the result of the Japanese invasion is only the creation of a state of anarchy in the three northeastern provinces. This is a very bad thing for the Japanese government's international reputation. The Japanese are trying to restore the security of the three northeastern provinces at all costs, even using all the military power of the country, to eliminate the volunteer army of the Chinese people who are resisting Japan to the death, in order to complete their plan to seize the entire three northeastern provinces. On the other hand, we in China have been restricted by this agreement from freely deploying Chinese troops to the surrounding areas of Shanghai, which belongs to our own territory. The Japanese, because they have the guarantee of this agreement, can save the military power of 50,000 troops stationed in Shanghai and huge military expenses. After this, they can hold Shanghai with a small number of troops very comfortably. Isn't this the most beneficial to the Japanese? There is another level. If we examine the clauses of this agreement in detail, such as Article 2, "Before the method of restoring normalcy in the area involved in this agreement has been decided, the Chinese army will remain in its current position." When will the so-called return to normalcy be decided? When will the Japanese agree to the decision? Moreover, the Japanese have also declared that the so-called return to normalcy includes not only military affairs, but also anti-Japanese propaganda and boycotts of Japanese goods. In addition, the Japanese have declared in foreign newspapers that the area they consider to be involved even includes the area south of Suzhou and east of the Huangpu River. However, we have not declared a denial. According to this speculation, is there still hope for our country to restore its sovereignty in Shanghai? Some people may say, "Then do you advocate that it would be better for the Japanese army not to withdraw from Shanghai?" I can answer without a doubt that the Japanese army must withdraw from Shanghai, but not only withdraw from Shanghai, but also withdraw from the three northeastern provinces at the same time. Otherwise, there is only resistance, only desperate resistance.</p>

<p>Extreme Danger Yesterday Noon</p>
<p>Condition Improved in the Evening, Life is Hopeful</p>
<p>After Minister Shigemitsu underwent major surgery to amputate his right leg, he was cared for overnight at Fumin Hospital by famous doctors. After midnight, his body temperature gradually increased, reaching a high of 40 degrees Celsius at 8 a.m. yesterday, which was extremely dangerous. It did not decrease until 1 p.m. After a detailed examination by military medical supervisor and medical doctor Goto, it was determined that it was caused by anemia after surgery.</p>
<p>Blood Transfusion Performed: At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, second-class military doctor Watanabe performed a blood transfusion, taking 300 grams of blood from his brother Shigemitsu's arm and transfusing it to Minister Shigemitsu. However, afterwards, due to the reaction to the blood transfusion, he became more excited, and his body temperature did not decrease.</p>
<p>Condition Improved Last Night: After 2 p.m. yesterday, Dr. Hattori Daisaku of Shinozaki Hospital, together with military medical supervisor Goto, diagnosed and treated him. At 5 p.m., his body temperature gradually decreased. At 6 p.m., his body temperature was 38.2 degrees Celsius, his pulse was 108, and his breathing was 26. His condition gradually improved. At that time, his appetite also increased. All the doctors believed that life had some hope. Shigemitsu's brother and younger brother also showed a slight relief.

<h3 id="e91">The Municipal Public Safety Bureau Prepares to Take Over Police Authority in War Zone <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Survey of Destroyed Police Stations Completed</p>
<p>Only Three of More Than Ten Stations are Intact</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau, led by Wen Yingxing, has held several meetings with its staff to discuss the takeover of police authority in the Zhabei and Wusong areas. A committee of eight members has been appointed to prepare for all takeover matters. Wen also sent personnel to survey the destroyed police stations and substations in the war zone. Repairs are now underway so that they can be restored to their original condition after the Japanese troops withdraw. The list of members of the Police Authority Takeover Committee and the details of the destroyed and intact police stations in the war zone are listed below:</p>
<p>Takeover Committee Members: Section Chief of the 1st Section, Zhen Shaoshen; Section Chief of the 2nd Section, Wang Zhijing; Section Chief of the 3rd Section, Wu Zhiquan; Secretary, Feng Shuluan; Ju Jing; Chief Inspector, Gong Xikui; Police Battalion Commander, Huang Zhao; Detective Squad Leader, Lu Ying.</p>
<p>Destroyed Police Stations: Baoshan Road 5th District Headquarters; Baziqiao Substation; Yipin Lane Substation; Qiujiang Road 5th District 2nd Substation and police outposts; Hujiamuqiao 5th District 3rd Substation; Yinxianggang 5th District 4th Substation; Jiangwan 5th District 5th Substation; Wusong 7th District Headquarters; also 7th District 3rd Substation, all substations, and all police outposts were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire or bombing, leaving only ruins.</p>
<p>Intact Police Stations: Qiujiang Road 5th District 1st Substation; Changan Road 4th District 1st Substation; Zhenru 4th District 3rd Substation. Although the above three locations were not destroyed by Japanese artillery fire or bombing, all the furniture and supplies inside were completely destroyed by the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Repairs Underway: As the peace agreement has been officially signed, the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, led by Wen Yingxing, has started the retreat of Japanese troops from the Zhabei and Wusong areas. The public safety of the area urgently needs police to maintain order. However, as most of the police stations have been destroyed by Japanese fire, personnel have been dispatched to Wusong, Zhabei, and Zhenru to quickly repair the damaged police stations so that police can be sent to maintain order as soon as the Japanese troops withdraw.</p>
<p>Various Groups Oppose: The Shanghai Federation of All Groups held its 42nd standing committee meeting yesterday at 4 PM, chaired by Yin Zhiling and recorded by Wu Yixin. The discussion concerned the National Government's declaration of tolerance for the organization of special police and the hiring of experts as police officers and instructors, which is clearly surrendering sovereignty and humiliating the country. The meeting resolved to send a telegram of opposition and appointed Li Cishan to draft it.</p>

<p>Kunshan, 6th Dispatch: Over a thousand Japanese troops from Liuhe were transferred elsewhere on the 5th. That night, 800 more troops from the Luodian area were redeployed to reinforce the defenses.

<p>U.S. Troops Hand Over Duties to Police</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Cross Border, Ready to Protest</p>
<p>Continental News reports that the area south of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, previously defended by British and American troops rotating every three months, will be handed over to the police starting today as the situation eases. The defense of the area was previously rotated between British and American troops every fifteen days. Recently, the Defense Committee of the Concession decided to gradually return border defense to the police as the situation in Shanghai has eased. The current U.S. troops are scheduled to complete their term of duty today and will hand over duties to the police without being replaced by British troops. It is claimed that the handover of defense duties by the U.S. troops was decided earlier and has absolutely no connection with the incident on Tuesday when Japanese soldiers entered the territory and injured Chinese citizens, or the subsequent standoff between U.S. and Japanese troops. Regarding the incident on Tuesday, a U.S. military officer stated yesterday that they consider the case closed and that relations between the U.S. and Japanese troops are completely harmonious. Officials of the Municipal Council stated that there is an understanding among the troops of various countries cooperating in the defense of the Public Concession that they will not cross borders and infringe on rights. If the Japanese troops have any complaints about residents within the U.S. defense area, they should negotiate with the U.S. authorities and not take action on their own. The Japanese troops' intrusion into the U.S. defense area and unauthorized actions violated the understanding. The U.S. troops stopped them themselves. The incident was raised for discussion at yesterday's regular meeting of the Municipal Council directors. It is expected that after the police submit a final detailed report, the Municipal Council will lodge a protest.</p>

<p>Service to Resume Immediately After Japanese Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways Administration, told reporters from the National News Agency yesterday that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has been shortened, and many tracks and bridges east of Kunshan have been destroyed. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed, the administration will begin implementing preliminary plans, including: (1) repairing railway tracks and bridges; (2) quickly building temporary office spaces at the destroyed stations; (3) repairing and replenishing traffic signals, electrical road signs, traffic telegrams, telephones, electric lights, and other traffic-related equipment; (4) coordinating vehicles and setting temporary train schedules; (5) making every effort to provide various conveniences for passengers within the possible scope; (6) printing various passenger tickets. In addition to the above six items, the Qingyang Port Bridge must also be repaired as soon as possible. Before the repairs are completed, if the Japanese troops have already withdrawn, a pontoon bridge will be built first, and three locomotives and twenty passenger cars will be borrowed from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to transport passengers to Qingyang Port for transfer. The railway bureau will be responsible for transferring luggage and goods. However, the work will be completed in two to three days at most. The date of resuming service cannot be determined yet, as it is not known when the Japanese troops will withdraw.</p>

<p>Requests Punishment of Perpetrators in the Case of Detaining Nanyang Employees</p>
<p>Investigate and Rescue Three Employees of Guanghe Fruit Store</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday: (1) Regarding the letter from the Shanghai Printing Industry Workers' Union, reporting the innocent detention of workers from the Nanyang Printing Company by Japanese soldiers, we are deeply grateful for your assistance in the rescue. All the detained workers were released at 7 PM on the 3rd. According to the released workers, the police inquired about the reason for their detention by Japanese soldiers. It was reported that they threw lead letters and other items into the Japanese store in the back, so the Japanese headquarters was informed that there were plainclothes agents. Later, because no evidence could be found, they were sent to the Haining Road police station, where the above-mentioned violation of police regulations was reported, along with three or four lead letters as evidence. It is said that these lead letters were taken away by the Japanese when they kidnapped the workers at 9 PM on the 2nd, so how could they be used as evidence? Even if there were such an incident, it should have been reported to the police and dealt with according to the law to avoid any malfeasance. Moreover, seven or eight out of ten of the released workers were beaten and injured by the Japanese soldiers and have not been able to work since. We are currently examining the injuries and will submit the injury reports as soon as they are filled out. We are now sending this letter to your council to request a serious protest to the Municipal Council. Now that police authority has been taken back, how can such incidents still occur? The council should ensure that similar incidents do not happen again in the future and order the perpetrators to compensate the workers for their injuries and punish the perpetrators as they deserve. Therefore, we hereby write to you, hoping that you will investigate and deal with this matter to show "fairness." Respectfully, to the General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council. (2) Regarding the letter from Guanghe Fruit Store at No. 1579 Wusong Road, stating that their store was broken into by Japanese troops at 3:30 AM on January 31st, and three employees, He Huichuan, Zhong Yujun, and Xiao Minghu, were kidnapped. Three months have passed, and their whereabouts are unknown. They have repeatedly requested the Municipal Council to rescue them, but to no avail. The store has always fulfilled its tax obligations and should enjoy the protection of its safety. Now that the workers have suffered such a disaster, the Municipal Council could not protect them beforehand and cannot investigate and rescue them afterward, which is a dereliction of duty and disregard for the lives of residents. The store has suffered a great loss and is filled with grief and indignation. Therefore, we hereby write to your council, requesting that you forward it to the Municipal Council to quickly rescue them, maintain humanity, and reassure businesses and residents. Since the unstable forces arrived in Shanghai, countless residents in the concession have been kidnapped and killed. This serious situation has not abated. According to the letter, it is even more difficult to restore normalcy, which is very worrying. We hereby write to your council, requesting that you investigate and rescue them as soon as possible. Respectfully, to the General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Relief for Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of Two Committees</p>
<p>Suspension of Raw Silk Tax and Public Bond Surcharge</p>
<p>Subsidy of 100 Taels Per Load for Exported Raw Silk</p>
<p>The silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been in decline for years, reaching a critical point. The Shanghai Incident has had a particularly significant impact. For example, less than one-tenth of the 113 single and double palace silk mills in Shanghai are barely surviving. The spring cocoon season is approaching, but few silk merchants are organizing to collect cocoons. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, for the sake of the livelihoods of farmers, have requested the National Government for relief. The government has now appointed special commissioners and established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Aged Silk and Cocoon Sorting Committee and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stored Silk Sales Committee, which will officially begin operations today. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Relief Measures: Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Department of Industry of Zhejiang Province, and He Yushu, Director of the Department of Industry of Jiangsu Province, went to Nanjing to negotiate with the relevant authorities on the relief of the silk and cocoon industry. Tan Zhongkui, Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Department, Zhang Fuyun, Director of the State Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces consulted on relief measures. As a result, the governments of the two provinces invited representatives of the banking industry, silk merchants, and silkworm farmers of the two provinces to hold a meeting at the Bank of China in Shanghai to discuss relief measures. The following resolutions were made: (1) The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will find ways to raise funds for relief. (2) The export tax on raw silk will be suspended to encourage exports. (3) The surcharge for the silk industry public bond fund will be suspended to reduce the burden. (4) The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Aged Silk and Cocoon Sorting Committee will be established. (5) The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stored Silk Sales Committee will be established. (6) A plan for the fundamental relief of the raw silk industry in the future will be developed. (7) A plan for the collection of cocoons this spring will be developed.</p>
<p>Appointment of Committee Members: Yesterday, the government issued an official order appointing the members of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Aged Silk and Cocoon Sorting Committee as Xu Boming, Shen Xiqing, Cai Wuji, Li Zufa, Qin Runqing, Feng Zhongqing, Huo Baoshu, Ye Zhuotang, Zhu Jing'an, Shen Huachen, Qian Fenghao, Sheng Lianxin, and others, thirteen in total. The members of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stored Silk Sales Committee are Xie Zuokai, He Bingxian, Wang Zhixin, Chen Julin, Xie Taofu, Bei Songsun, Li Shoushan, Wu Shenbo, Xue Shouquan, Zhou Junmei, Li Shuchu, Presi and Fumegali, thirteen in total.</p>
<p>Official Establishment: Yesterday, the two committees held a meeting at the Bank of China and elected Xu Boming, Cai Wuji, Li Zufa, Qin Runqing, Huo Baoshu, Ye Zhuotang, and Zhu Jing'an as standing committee members of the Zhejiang Aged Silk and Cocoon Committee, and Xie Zuokai, He Bingxian, Chen Julin, Xie Taofu, Bei Songsun, Wu Shenbo, and Li Shuchu as standing committee members of the Stored Silk Sales Committee. The committees were officially established, and an office was set up on the third floor of No. 15 Museum Road, which will begin operations immediately from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Notice to All Sectors: The first notice of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Aged Silk and Cocoon Sorting Committee states: It has been found that the amount of aged silk and cocoons accumulated in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces over the years is very large, and the impact is worrying. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in view of this, have allocated funds for relief. All aged silk and cocoons in the two provinces, as well as factory silk reeled from aged cocoons, will be subsidized with 100 taels of silver per load when exported overseas (no subsidies will be given for those not exported). At the same time, the two provincial governments have submitted a request to the National Government and sent a notice to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to suspend the collection of raw silk export tax and the silk industry public bond fund surcharge to reduce the burden. The committee has been established to handle the sorting procedures. All aged silk and cocoons that have been mortgaged must be registered with the committee by May 15th (May 20th for other ports). (The government will no longer provide subsidies for those who fail to register by the deadline.) The committee will then send personnel to inspect and weigh the goods and issue certificates to prevent confusion and avoid missing out. The deadline is approaching, so please do not delay and miss the opportunity. This notice is hereby given.</p>

<p>Sino-Korean Anti-Japanese Great Alliance Sends Letter to Lawyers Association</p>
<p>Following the bombing case at Hongkou Park in the Public Concession, Korean revolutionary leader Ahn Chang-ho was arrested. Yesterday, the Sino-Korean Anti-Japanese Great Alliance sent a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association: Regarding the Hongkou bombing case, many Koreans have been implicated, and those residing in the French Concession have been arrested. The case is entirely political in nature. According to international law, neutral countries have provisions to protect political prisoners, and countries have always adhered to this principle. The French Concession is under Chinese sovereignty and is designated as a place for French residents to live. The French consul should abide by international law and protect political prisoners. How can they allow Japanese military police to be stationed on various roads to search for Koreans and, at the request of the Japanese consulate, extradite Korean revolutionary leader Ahn Chang-ho and others? This clearly violates international law and undermines Chinese legal rights, which is outrageous. We hereby request your association to uphold justice, argue on the basis of reason, and promptly lodge a serious protest with the authorities and the French consul, and also request the League of Nations to take measures to stop it, so as to maintain the rule of law and protect national rights. It is for the public good. Respectfully, the Sino-Korean Anti-Japanese Great Alliance.</p>

<p>Shen Atao and Lu Wenjin</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau, led by Director Wen, previously received an order to arrest Shen Atao and Lu Wenjin, two drivers of a freight truck company in Shanghai with Concession license plate (16767), for transporting military supplies for the enemy. Yesterday, Zhang Dongkai, the District Chief of the 2nd District of the bureau, dispatched police to arrest them. The truck with license plate number, as well as the drivers Shen Atao and Lu Wenjin, were handed over to the 3rd Section of the Public Safety Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Reasons for Consolidating the Postal Foundation: Specific Proposals <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Presented by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union (Continued)</p>
<p>Reason Two: The reason why postal savings are most secure is that the personnel managing the savings are postal workers, whose appointments and benefits are guaranteed, allowing them to serve with peace of mind, be honest and impartial, and because the post office serves as a guarantor, it gains the trust of the public. Since the establishment of a special bureau for savings and remittance, the people employed have not been limited to postal personnel. Recently, due to political changes, the bureau chiefs have been replaced accordingly, and as a result, dozens of personnel in the general bureau and its affiliated branch bureaus have also been replaced. Previously, the general bureau employed postal personnel and external personnel in a ratio of about half and half. Now, postal personnel are being sent back to the post office to serve, and it seems that savings and remittances will all be managed by people unrelated to the post office, while still using the name "Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau". It is unfair to make the post office and its personnel bear the responsibility. Moreover, although the total amount of postal savings is now 30 million yuan, and the amount of remittances is 200 million yuan, each item is extremely trivial and consists of the hard-earned money of ordinary people. The trivial amounts result in increasingly complex accounting records. If the responsible persons are not in their positions for a long time, problems will arise, and there will be no way to investigate. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has only been established for two years, and the phenomenon of personnel changes following politics has already been discovered. In the future, if political officials change frequently, the bureau's personnel will also change accordingly. The more frequent the changes, the more confused the responsibilities will be, and the hard-earned money of ordinary people will definitely be in danger. For the sake of the interests of the people and the credit of the post office, the postal savings and remittance business should be returned to the post office. This is one reason. According to Article 33 of the International Postal Convention, "Other agencies may join the exchange of bills of exchange. If the remittance business of various countries is handled by agencies other than the post office, they may also join the bill of exchange procedures stipulated in the various articles of this agreement." The agency handling the bill of exchange business must consult with the post office of its own country on everything in order to implement it. All provisions of this agreement, all exchanges between the agency and other countries joining this agreement and the International Postal Bureau, shall be relayed by the post office of its own country. Now that the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is gradually sending postal personnel back to the post office, in the future, the international community may recognize the bureau as a non-postal agency and request the separate formulation of a gold remittance bureau. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is gradually sending postal personnel back to the post office, and in the future, the international community may recognize the bureau as a non-postal agency and request the separate formulation of an exchange bill system. The position of our country's post office in the international community will be greatly affected. This is the second reason. "The name 'Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau' implies that it is an agency for handling postal savings and remittance business, but in reality, postal personnel will soon disappear from it." This is not debatable. The backbone of the general bureau consists of three businesses: savings, remittance, and insurance. Now, the postal personnel who were sent to Japan to study insurance matters with dedication have been returned to the post office to serve, and the deputy director of the savings department who has many years of experience in handling postal savings has also been sent back to the post office. Furthermore, the director of the department has been transferred to another position, and the director of the remittance department has been appointed to concurrently manage the savings department. The deputy director of the remittance department has also been dismissed. Originally, four people were in charge of the two departments, but now one person is in charge of everything. It is speculated that the intention is to save money. However, the simplification of the general bureau's backbone business has been proven by facts. The affairs of the three departments of savings, remittance, and insurance, which are the backbone businesses, can be handled so easily. Then, the general bureau can be renamed the "Postal Funds Management Bureau" and the words "Savings and Remittance" can be removed. Wouldn't that be a name that matches reality? If the intention is to save money, then why not merge the bureau into the Postal General Bureau and return to the original organization? Wouldn't that be even more economical? Moreover, the facts should be like this. The affairs handled by the general bureau have been handled by the Postal General Bureau for 30 years with only a department established, and its business has indeed been developing year by year. Now, a separate general bureau has been established, creating an unnecessary position of bureau chief, two deputy bureau chiefs, and heads of the general affairs office, the secretary's office, the accounting office, the joint accounting office, the insurance office (still in preparation for handling simple insurance business), deputy heads, secretaries, consultants, medical officers, section chiefs, clerks, office assistants, assistants, trainees, and other committee members, totaling one or two hundred people. Their salaries, pensions, rents, and office expenses amount to a total waste of 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan per year, which is borne by the post office. If it is said that this expenditure can be offset by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau making banking business outside of the savings and remittance business, earning income, I would like to ask whether the bureau has a special fund for its establishment and whether the established credit is fully utilized by using the post office's working capital and credit to engage in the banking business. To discuss in detail, the bureau was established by taking the Japanese charter as a model. According to Japanese law, the Postal Savings Bureau should not engage in banking business and compete with other banks. Even if the country allows it to concurrently operate this business, can't the Postal General Bureau also concurrently operate it? Why set up a special bureau to manage the funds? Moreover, the current director of the bureau, Yang Jianping, is skilled in military logistics and is not a banking expert. Can he be better than the personnel of the Postal General Bureau? If it is said that a special bureau must be established to specialize in responsibilities and promote development, then a dedicated deputy director can be placed under the director of the Postal General Bureau to handle the affairs with ease. Why create such unnecessary expenses? Japan established a separate Postal Savings Bureau only more than 20 years ago. At that time, Japan's small country savings had reached 300 million Japanese yen, so it felt that the affairs had become increasingly complex, and there was a split. Now, our country's savings are less than 30 million silver yuan, and there is absolutely no need to split. This is the third reason. In addition to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the separate establishment of savings and remittance branch bureaus in Nanjing and Hankou is not allowed by the systems of other countries, nor is it allowed by the Japanese system that is being taken as a model. The waste is even greater, and it is absolutely a redundant agency. This is the fourth reason. Currently, the Postal General Bureau and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau have joint presentations to the Ministry of Communications, and the Postal Department has joint letters, and there are joint orders, joint circulars, joint announcements, and joint telegrams to the postal directors and personnel of various regions. This is unprecedented in other countries. There are official documents and letters for mutual consultation on official matters. The procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming, which is extremely inconvenient. Previously, the appointment, reward, punishment, and promotion of postal personnel were carried out by the director of the Postal General Bureau in accordance with regulations, and the authority was unified. Now, important vacancies and matters involving savings and remittance affairs are handled by the Postal General Bureau after soliciting the consent of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. The Savings and Remittance Bureau can appoint outsiders as managers, directors, section chiefs, etc. without the consent of the Postal General Bureau. This is putting the cart before the horse, and there are two separate branches. This is truly an unprecedented example in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The Postal General Bureau cannot manage all the funds of the post office. In case of emergency needs, it must take out interest and overdraft from the Savings and Remittance Bureau, which is also unreasonable. If this continues for a long time, it is feared that the postal personnel will become increasingly resentful and will not be able to cooperate with the Savings and Remittance Bureau. Therefore, a merger should be urgently carried out. This is the fifth reason. Based on the above five points, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau should be merged into the Postal General Bureau. For the convenience of the transition, the director of the Postal General Bureau should temporarily take over the Postal General Bureau. The future organization must be handled in accordance with the proposals in March, April, May, and July. The reason is nothing more than to protect the hard-earned money of the people, managed by guaranteed personnel, not affected by political trends, and able to specialize in their responsibilities and promote their development, which is not only to save 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan in unnecessary expenses and reduce the burden on the post office.</p>
<p>Reason Three: Airmail is originally a new business in modern times, and the state should run it to meet the needs of business. However, no country that runs airmail has not lost money. Taking the United States, the most developed country in airmail, as an example, the annual loss is nearly 9 million US dollars, which is equivalent to about 40 million Chinese currency. Our country's post office is just beginning to sprout, how can it bear this burden? Moreover, there is a need to open up postal routes in remote areas to promote culture everywhere. How can we rush to decorate the facade? If the government is determined to run it, it should also allocate funds from the national treasury. Otherwise, the Ministry of Communications will allocate the 1.3 million yuan that the post office has remitted over the years (from the 18th to the 20th year). (See the above). In addition to paying the mail freight, the company should also be responsible for all the expenses of the company, which amount to tens of thousands of yuan a year, thereby hindering the development of the post office. Therefore, the airline should be run by the government with funds allocated, and at the same time, the post office should no longer bear any subsidies for aviation, and its remaining strength should be used to fully develop the post office itself and gradually seek its development. The post office and aviation can then advance together without limits.</p>
<p>Reason Four: The post office's budget for this year is actually 4 million yuan short. Now that the national treasury is exhausted, it is difficult to seek government assistance to make up for the post office's losses. Therefore, the only way is to first find the source of the post office's losses and make overall plans for specific plans to consolidate the postal foundation. For example, the principle of "supporting the post office with the post office" as stated in the above reasons, the abolition of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the cessation of all subsidies to aviation companies must be actively promoted to be implemented. At least, more than 4 million yuan in unnecessary expenses can be saved annually. Although the current shortage urgently needs to be opened up to supplement the source of funds, this is only a temporary transitional difficulty and is not the root cause of the post office's problems. If the temporary difficulties are used to increase postage rates by as much as 50% without regard to the future of the post office and the burdens on the people, and no fundamental improvements are made in postal administration, it will only increase the burdens on the public, and the result of the increase will not help the current post office at all. Moreover, according to the rates set by the Ministry, the post office's revenue can be increased by more than 10 million yuan annually. However, if the post office can earnestly implement the principle of "supporting the post office with the post office" and save all unnecessary and excessive expenses of agencies, the natural surplus each year will be at least more than 2 million yuan. Combined, the post office can expect to have a surplus of more than 10 million yuan annually, excluding legitimate expenses and development costs. It is doubtful whether the post office, which acts as a labor agent, needs such a large surplus. The Ministry's hard work in maintaining the post office is greatly appreciated. However, what the union and others dare not agree with is that the Ministry does not first write a plan to consolidate the postal foundation and the post office's minimum budget, and then seek ways to adjust the postal economy to solve the current difficulties, so that the people can understand the truth of the postal economy and understand the reasons for the post office's losses. They all admire the Ministry's hard work in maintaining the post office and are happy to bear the burden. The government can also avoid attacks from public opinion, which is truly a manifestation of the spirit of governance. This is why the union and others advocate maintaining the original postage rates temporarily and requesting the Ministry to first plan for fundamental plans. (End)</p>

<p>The Beijing Branch Closed Due to Few Affairs</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger in this city stated yesterday that the report in the Continental News that the bank would cease operations from July 1 due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War was untrue. It was claimed that the bank's reserves were not affected by the Japanese army's occupation of Shenyang and the Shanghai war. As for the closure of the Beijing branch, it was not due to commercial depression, the atmosphere of war, and the Japanese army's occupation of Zhabei, but because the Beijing branch was established specifically for business related to the government. Now that the Chinese government has moved south, the affairs are idle, so it was closed.</p>

<p>The Union Has Started Registration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Workers' Union is located within the war zone. During the war, the union's headquarters was burned down. Among the silk factories in the Yokohama Bridge area, nine, including Yunyu, were completely destroyed. A considerable number suffered significant losses. To date, there is no hope of resuming operations. As a result, the number of unemployed workers, both male and female, has reached more than 30,000, and their livelihoods are difficult to describe. In order to relieve unemployed workers, the association has temporarily used No. 138 Yonghefang, Huaihe Road as a temporary office and immediately started preparing for registration and other matters, so that it can request the superiors to find ways to provide relief. If you are a member of the association, you can go to register.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Wu Mai's Case Against Wu Tiecheng and Others Transferred Jurisdiction <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Under the Jurisdiction of Jiangning District Court</p>
<p>Wu Mai's lawsuit against Wu Tiecheng and others for injury and confinement in the Shanghai District Court has been reported in various newspapers. This case has been ordered by the Jiangsu High Court to transfer jurisdiction to the Jiangning District Court. The text of the High Court's ruling is recorded as follows: Jiangsu High Court Criminal Ruling 20th Year Sheng Zi No. 282. Ruling applicant: Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court. The right applicant requested a transfer of jurisdiction due to Wu Mai's obstruction of official duties, incitement to escape, and Wu Tiecheng and others' injury and dereliction of duty. The court ruled as follows: Main text: This case should be transferred to the Jiangning District Court for first-instance jurisdiction. Reason: The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau reported to the prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court that Wu Mai obstructed official duties and incited escape, and that Wu Mai accused Wu Tiecheng and others of injury and dereliction of duty. According to the prosecutor's application, this case arose because Wu Mai, representing the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Federation, failed to bail out communist suspects from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. Wu Mai is also a person who has been wanted. After reviewing the case files investigated by this office, the facts are clear. Since this office accepted this case, letters and notes of concern from groups such as the Republic of China National Salvation Association, the Southeast Five Provinces Anti-Japanese Association, and the National Lawyers Association have been sent one after another. Wu Mai is also comparable to someone with a considerable reputation in Shanghai society. Others, such as Wu Tiecheng, are the highest administrative officials of Shanghai and are currently also important officials in the country dealing with foreign affairs. Wen Yingxing, Wu Zhiquan, and others are police officers directly maintaining public security in Shanghai. At this time, a violent neighbor is invading the country, and Shanghai is an important area for war. In this environment, accepting this case, whether the defendant is guilty or innocent in the future, will inevitably harm public security. The application for transfer of jurisdiction is consistent with the provisions of Article 21, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law and should be approved to transfer this case to the Jiangning District Court for first-instance jurisdiction. This ruling is made as the main text. April 25, 21st Year of the Republic of China. Jiangsu High Court Criminal Third Tribunal Judge and Presiding Judge Song Yuan, Judge Zheng Zhiguo, Judge Yin Yuxu. It is certified that the original is consistent with the original. Jiangsu High Court Clerk Ma Yiqing, April 28, 21st Year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Petition Result of the Rent Reduction and Exemption Committee Is Satisfactory <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Is Willing to Lead to Achieve the Purpose of Rent Reduction and Exemption</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to Provide Detailed Measures</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction and Exemption Committee formulated the rent reduction and exemption measures by district, and submitted them to the general meeting for approval and promulgation, few landlords have expressed acceptance, and most are still waiting and watching. The wealthy and unkind landlords still rely on their power to force residents, who cannot bear their harassment. In order to quickly resolve the issue, the committee appointed representatives Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, and Li Yongxiang yesterday to prepare documents (with seals, a total of 111 groups) and petition the municipal party and government authorities, requesting that they be implemented as soon as possible. First, they went to the municipal party department, where Secretary-General Jiang Huaisu received them. After the representatives stated the suffering of the citizens and the purpose of rent reduction and exemption, and requested that they be implemented by order, Jiang replied that the party has long paid attention to this matter and is willing to lead the people to achieve the purpose of rent reduction and exemption, so as to alleviate the suffering of the citizens. The measures formulated by your association are very thoughtful, and I fully agree with them. I will convey them to the government for implementation by order. The party will provide assistance in accordance with the party's program. After listening to the words, the representatives expressed their satisfaction and left. They went to the municipal government and made the same request. Zhu Weicong of the Second Section came out to meet them. After the representatives stated their opinions, Zhu said that the municipal government is very eager to quickly resolve the rent reduction and exemption issue in this city in order to quell disputes. However, because this matter is of great importance, it is feared that a slight mistake will lead to a great disaster. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the matter solemnly. The Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to provide detailed measures and plans to restore the Rent Housing Review and Dispute Committee, with the aim of doing its best to handle the matter as soon as possible. The representatives also said that society believes that this matter is of great importance and that people's organizations should not seek their own interests. Rent reduction and exemption is related to the vital interests of the majority of citizens and requires the acceptance of the public opinion of people's organizations in order to achieve a good solution. If the Chinese Taxpayers' Association is only responsible for its supervisory responsibilities to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, it may not be aware of this matter. Please pay attention to this point. Zhu agreed to accept it, and the representatives left.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Bullets Flew on Beil Road; Detective and Thief Died <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>One of the Three Bandits Was Captured</p>
<p>A Stray Bullet Injured a Passerby</p>
<p>At 8:30 last night, a gunfight between a detective and bandits occurred on Beil Road, Route Cardinal Foch, in the French Concession. Jin Baoyi, a newly promoted detective, was shot in the head by a bandit and died on the spot. A stray bullet injured a pedestrian. As a result, one bandit was captured. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After the Ma Case Occurred: After the major case in which Yifa, the fifth son of Ma Changsheng, a major antique merchant on Route Grolier, was kidnapped and the chauffeur Xia Baosheng was shot dead on the spot, the police authorities of the French Concession attached great importance to it and ordered all subordinates to investigate strictly in order to solve the case in the shortest possible time. As a result, the detectives of each police station felt more stressed, and the uniformed detectives who checked pedestrians on the road felt even more responsible.</p>
<p>Three Suspicious Youths: At about 6:00 last night, Uniformed Detective Lu Zhulin, along with Detective Zhao Chunsheng and newly promoted Detective Jin Baoyi, were checking pedestrians at various important road junctions. At 8:30, when they were checking east to west at the corner of Beil Road and Route Cardinal Foch at the Eight Immortals Bridge, three youths dressed in blue cloth shorts suddenly walked towards them, and their appearance was very suspicious. The detectives ordered them to stop, but not only did the three not stop, but they turned around and ran away, and fired a shot to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Detective Shot Dead: Seeing that the situation was not good, the detectives also drew their guns and chased after them. The two sides fired at each other more than 20 shots. Detective Jin was shot twice, one bullet hitting his right temple and penetrating his brain, and he fell to the ground and died immediately. Two of the bandits fled north into the International Settlement and disappeared in an instant. One bandit dressed in blue cloth shorts fled south to the front of the National Western Clothing Store at No. 242 Avenue Joffre and was intercepted by Chinese Constables from No. 65 who were stationed there, along with Detective Zhao. A Mauser pistol and more than ten bullets were seized on the spot.</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Injures One Person: After one bandit was captured, the police station heard the alarm and dispatched a large number of detectives to help capture the bandits. However, the remaining bandits had long since disappeared. They immediately transported the body of Detective Jin to the Tongren Fu Yuan Funeral Home to wait for an autopsy. At the same time, they took the captured bandit into the police station. According to the bandit, he was from Anhui, but his age and name were temporarily not disclosed. When the detectives and bandits were firing at each other, bullets flew on Beil Road, and a stray bullet injured Zhou Yuehu, a pedestrian. It was found that Zhou was from Taicang, 33 years old, and worked as a tailor. He is currently a partner at Wang Shunxing Tailor Shop at No. 22 Daohaili, Beil Road. The bullet hit his left thigh and he went to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment to Comfort the Loyal Soul: Afterwards, it was learned that Detective Jin Baoyi was originally from Siyang, only 36 years old, and had served as Chinese Constable No. 362 in the French Concession for many years. Because of his loyalty and bravery, he had repeatedly won merits and was recently promoted to probationary detective No. 61. He had only been married for a short time, and now he died in the line of duty. Those who heard about it regretted it. It is said that the police station authorities intend to give him the most preferential treatment in order to comfort his loyal soul and show future generations.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Labor Dispute Occurred at the Qiu Xin Shipyard <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Since Maitilo (Frenchman) was appointed as the director of the Shanghai Military Camp Qiu Xin Shipyard last year, he has arbitrarily undermined the labor-capital contract, abused fines for wages, and forced workers to leave the union, which has aroused the resentment of all the workers in the factory. Although the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the General Labor Union have negotiated many times, no results have been achieved. On May 5, a strike occurred. The workers were in good order. It is heard that the First District Shipbuilding Industry Union has submitted a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for further negotiations, and has requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to consult with the Municipal Public Security Bureau to protect the plant.</p>

<p>A Westerner, Harry Mees (transliteration), 38 years old and a Czech national, recently set up a roulette casino on the second floor of No. 341 Avenue Meyers, French Concession.  Li Daiyi, the Western Chief Detective of the French police, learned of his drawing profits from gambling and on the evening of the 4th, led Chinese detectives He Tugeng and Liu Kunbao, along with detectives on duty, to the premises.  There they arrested Harry Mees and nine gamblers:  Lin Weitian, Lin Zhangshi, Lin Sanmei, Li Qi, Li Wangshi (all from Fujian), Zhu Miaofeng, Wang Gengsheng (both local), and Bao Fucheng (from Suzhou), men and women in total. They seized gambling paraphernalia including one roulette wheel, two pieces of table cloth, three ivory chips, twelve boxes of chips, one small suitcase, nine hard paper gambling cards, eleven account books, and gambling money totaling 194 silver dollars.  In a room on the third floor, they also discovered one set of smoking paraphernalia and a lamp gun, along with parts. The suspects were taken to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, the gamblers were each ordered to pay 30 silver dollars in cash for bail while Harry Mees was detained. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court to be tried by Judge Wu Fanglian. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case, stating that the defendant had privately established a gambling den, gathered people to gamble, and profited from it, violating Article 280 of the Criminal Law, and requested that he be investigated and prosecuted according to the law.  Next, the officer in charge, Bao, reported the details of the arrest and presented the evidence. The bailed-out gamblers had not appeared in court. When questioned, the defendant Harry Mees confessed that he was hired by a certain Wang to manage the casino, which had started operating on the evening of the 3rd. He claimed not to know Wang's whereabouts and denied any knowledge of the smoking paraphernalia found. After examining the confession, the court ordered the defendant to pay a security deposit of one thousand dollars and provide a guarantor; without a guarantor, he would be detained. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e112">County Finance Bureau Urgently Demands Payment of Arrears for "Busy Season" Grain Tax <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has found that the arrears for the "busy season" grain tax in this county are quite substantial.  Although the bureau has repeatedly ordered its officials to rigorously demand payment, many have still delayed and failed to pay.  The bureau believes that given the current financial straits of the province and county, and the finance department's urgent demands for funds, no further delays can be tolerated.  Yesterday, the bureau specially summoned the tax collection officials from each district to the bureau to give them instructions, strictly ordering them to urgently demand payment and set a deadline of the second Mao day (May 2nd Mao day) to clear up the arrears from the 18th and 19th years.  As for the unpaid "busy season" silver from the 20th year, it must also be cleared up within the tenth Mao day.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Da Xin Silk and Satin Bureau Submits Document to the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Da Xin Silk and Satin Bureau, located at the intersection of Shilu and Sanma Road, has recently observed the slow sales of domestic silk and satin.  In addition to launching a large-scale clearance sale starting from May 5th to promote sales, the bureau also advocates promoting silk clothing in the hope of achieving significant results. The bureau has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to establish regulations and issue a national mandate for uniform compliance. The original submission is excerpted below:  The submission is for requesting prompt issuance of regulations to promote silk clothing, in order to encourage and enrich the people's livelihood.  It is believed that today our country is subjected to the invasion of the violent Japanese externally, and internally feels the decline of people's livelihood. Dangerous situations arise in cycles, and the danger of subjugation is worrying. Therefore, the way to save the country and enrich the people's livelihood cannot be delayed.  Our bureau adheres to the principle of saving the country through our own industry, and thus has a modest proposal to promote silk clothing, which is presented herewith. Silk is a unique national treasure of our country, shining upon the world for thousands of years and a major part of international trade.  Today, it is declining and dying, resulting in farmers not daring to plant mulberry trees, village women not daring to raise silkworms, workers not reeling silk, and merchants not trading it.  All are afraid of the slow sales of silk. Its direct and indirect impact on the people's livelihood is enormous. Our bureau has identified the crux of the problem, and therefore believes that to promote domestic goods, one must start with the silk industry, and to promote silk, one must promote silk clothing to expand its sales.  This is not only a good remedy for rescuing the silk industry but also a superior strategy for enriching the people's livelihood. Ever since the popularity of Western suits, foreign wool and broadcloth have flooded the market, causing a painful blow to the sales of silk clothing materials. However, the value of wool and broadcloth has never been cheaper than silk. It can be seen that the slow sales of silk are not due to the people's weak purchasing power, but to the popularity of Western suits and the flooding of wool and broadcloth. If the government authorities can now establish regulations to promote silk clothing and issue a national mandate for uniform compliance, the effect of superiors leading by example will be enormous.  Considering that Japanese women are required to wear kimonos when attending aristocratic banquets to emphasize their national identity, which has profound significance for preserving their national essence.  China's industry is nascent, and the people's wisdom is not yet widespread, and relies on the government to promote and guide it, so as to provide support.  Our bureau, within the limits of our humble knowledge, dares to submit this request to your esteemed ministry for review and approval, to allow the establishment of regulations to promote silk clothing, in order to encourage and enrich the people's livelihood.  In a state of urgent expectation, we respectfully await your orders and submit this to the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>Woman Zhang Xu Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Shao Zhongxiong, a Ningbo native who works as a runner for a car company at No. 35 Huagequan Road, French Concession, was driving car number 8317 at 5:15 PM on the 5th, taking his wife to a certain restaurant. While passing through Avenue Joffre, heading east, and approaching No. 424, Zhang Xu (age 32), a woman from Danyang, and her neighbor Wang Sukun, suddenly crossed the road from south to north. The two parties could not avoid each other, and the woman was struck by the car, injuring her head. A patrolman witnessed the incident and took the injured woman and Shao to the police station. The woman was sent to Guangci Hospital, but she died of her injuries at 8:00 AM the next morning. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy room. At 10:00 AM, the Traffic Department reported to the Second Special District Court. Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke was appointed to examine the body and opened a public case. The family of the deceased had not arrived. After Mr. Wu questioned the defendant about the incident, he ruled that Zhang Xu had indeed died from a brain injury caused by being hit by a car. The body would be held until the family arrived to claim and bury it. The defendant was sent to court by the police for handling.</p>

<p>Heavier Penalties Imposed After Discovery</p>
<p>Court Now Photographing All Criminals</p>
<p>The robber Xu Aqin was sentenced to twelve years in prison by the Shanghai District Court. While the case was being finalized, the opium offender Wang Xuesheng was sentenced to fifty days of detention. When they were jointly sent to the Second Prison in Caohejing, Xu Aqin and Wang Xuesheng conspired to exchange names, so that Xu Aqin was executed as Wang Xuesheng, and Wang Xuesheng was executed as Xu Aqin. However, Wang Xuesheng's sentence was very short, so he was released according to law after a short period. Thus, Xu Aqin escaped the law by impersonating Wang Xuesheng. But Wang Xuesheng, having impersonated Xu Aqin, should have served a twelve-year sentence on his behalf. However, his plan was cunning: if he explained the matter afterwards, there would be no legal basis for serving a sentence on behalf of another person, and at most he would be given additional punishment, but not the long term of twelve years. Therefore, as soon as Xu Aqin was released under the false name, Wang Xuesheng immediately declared the error. The prison staff immediately reported to Warden Dong, and Wang Xuesheng was sent to the District Court for interrogation. At the same time, a large reward was offered for the capture of Xu Aqin, who was captured in the countryside of Chuansha and also sent to the court. The two criminals Wang and Xu have been given heavier penalties. However, cases of criminals swapping identities have become increasingly common recently. Therefore, the court now plans to photograph all convicted criminals and include the photographs with the case files for execution.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Gold Prices Slightly Decline, One Taels Weak <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Unpredictable The gold market yesterday was still confusing, rising and falling erratically, with fluctuations of about six taels both before and after the market opened. Ultimately, it fell by one tael. Initially, the silver market slightly increased, and market sentiment was still good, trending upwards. It nearly broke 740 taels. However, as exchange rates eased, sellers in the market became more numerous, and news of the silver price conference suddenly turned weak. The afternoon market initially stabilized but then declined, with supply exceeding demand, ultimately breaking 40 taels, which was caused by the hardening of exchange rates. The final price was within 38 taels. As for spot transactions, none were reported. The detailed situation for the entire day is recorded below:</p>
<p>Morning Once Exceeded 40 Taels Opening in the morning, the June contract rose by 3.8 taels to 742.5 taels. Large bars continued to rise by 1/16, and silver prices by 1/8. Private telegrams rose by 3/16, but without any impact. This was all because the ceasefire and peace treaty had been signed, so the situation could stabilize. Then it increased by another 2.8 yuan, offered by Shunli Yuanheng and others. Then it retreated by about 2 taels, to 41 taels. Later, because the bank absorbed Citibank's June contract at $30.25, and British gold settlers were active, McCallie HSBC sold July contracts at 176875, and then counter-traded at 6875, so the market became stronger. Hengyu Qianchang Xiangyuan Kangxiang Tong Taichang Hong Kangyong and others successively competed to buy, and prices rose sharply by 4 taels to 45 taels. At this time, the June US dollar only settled at $30.0625. Soon after, Huabi offered 125, and Dade Cheng Yuhe Yuanmao Yong and others sold, and the price retreated to 43 taels. The British gold opened as before, Hong Kong added 375, and Zhaofeng Chang Hengyu goods hedged, and Fuchang and others entered. July futures only settled at 625, and August at 6875, so the gold price rebounded, and at 9:45 it was 45.3 taels (the highest price of the day). Later, Xie Xing Yong Runchang Yu Yifeng Yongri Chang and others came to sell, and at 10:20 it was 42.8 taels. Zhifeng Yongze entered, pulling up 2 taels. At 10:30 it was 44.9 taels. After that, it seemed low, with only fluctuations of one or two taels. After 11:15, it was especially weak. Because it was rumored that the silver conference would be promising, D興 Yong Hengyu Dalian Bang and others sold very hard. Furthermore, as the US dollar turned weak, the US and Japanese banks reciprocally transacted the June contract at 3125. Until 11:45, it ended at 39 taels. Goods and retail households bought in, and it rose by more than one tael. At noon, it closed at 40.04 taels. The quoted price was still 807 taels, counting 623 taels to 678 taels.</p>
<p>Supply Exceeded Demand Before Closing After the market opened, the price was 741.5 taels, changing by 1.2 yuan, and increasing to 3.5 yuan. Because Mumbai telegrammed to HSBC and others to buy August US dollars at 4375. After 2:30, it suddenly declined. Maihang sold July contracts at $30.0375. This month’s British gold counter-traded at 176875. Then, the US dollar was difficult to sell at half a yuan, and was already done at 625. Furthermore, as Zhifeng Yong Yuanheng Fuchang Shunli Tong Taichang and others sold hard, the price fell sharply, until 3:10 to 37.7 yuan. Fuxing Yong entered and Mitsui absorbed August US dollars at 5625, so the price pulled up by more than one tael. At 3:30, it was 39.3 taels. Due to poor air, short positions were active. At 4:20, it was 37.5 taels. At that time, it increased to 8.2 yuan. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 37.8 taels, a decrease of 9 yuan compared to the previous day. The largest price during the day was 45.3 taels, and the smallest price was 37.5 taels, a difference of 7.8 taels. The quoted price was calculated from 63.4 taels to 70 taels. The registered price was 40 taels, and the water supplement was 40 taels to 38 taels. The red bar was calculated to add 5.25 taels.</p>
<p>Heavy Speculative Desire Among Peers According to the table-top transaction statistics, Tong Taichang, Hong Kangyong, Yuhe, Fuchang, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuan Kangxiang, and Futai Heng all entered. Shunli, Fuyu, Yiyu, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Dade Cheng, and Daxing Yong all exited. Hengyu, Yuantai, Fuyu, and Zhifeng Yong were very busy in and out. Mr. Wu exited. In the afternoon, Yuanmao Yong, Taifeng Cheng, Yifeng, and Fuxing Yong all entered. Shunli, Tong Taichang, Fuchang, Hong Kangyong, Qianchang Xiang, and Yifeng Yong all exited. The incoming and outgoing of other numbers are very complicated.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Foreign Exchange Slightly Fluctuates <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Pattern Seems to be Stabilizing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American exchange rates were still level. HSBC's listings for British, American, Indian, and other currencies were unchanged. Only the French franc decreased by one yuan, the German mark increased by 25, the Singapore dollar increased by 25, and the Hong Kong dollar increased by 375 to 77.125 taels. The actual transaction prices of banks seemed to be improving. However, there were slight fluctuations throughout the day. As a result, the British gold exchange rate decreased by 0625 compared to the previous evening, and the American gold exchange rate decreased by 1875. The market sentiment of the gold market was unstable. Gold exchange transactions were still strong in each gold shop. It is estimated that 56,000 pounds of British gold were traded, most of which were sold. Also, approximately 780,000 yuan of US dollars were transacted. In the morning market, the buying was overdone. There was some selling in the afternoon market, with occasional gold hedging. However, there were conflicting reports, and people were confused. In the afternoon, Mumbai telegraphed to enter August contracts. The American bank also entered June contracts. Anda sold shillings at 1775 in the afternoon and bought US dollars at $30.50 in August, and the British and American exchange rates totaled $3.71.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Lack of Momentum Causes Prices to Waver <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Currently, the price of foreign silk (洋厘) ought to be high due to seasonal demand and ample supply opportunities. However, the devastation after the war has prevented recovery, causing a missed opportunity. In terms of the current situation, Chinese merchants have very little capacity to compete in the silkworm cocoon market. Recently, only foreign firms have made some preparations to export foreign silk. It is feared that there are few silkworm rearers in the mainland, resulting in limited production. Therefore, the price of foreign silk, despite attempts to rise, is consistently suppressed, resulting in prices remaining in flux.</p>
<p>Price Fluctuations: The morning market for "foreign silk" was quite lively due to bank purchases, and the price increased by 1.5 cents (厘) from the previous afternoon, reaching 7 qian (錢) and 5 cents. The afternoon trend weakened, and the closing price fell by a small 3 hao (毫) and 7 hu (忽) and a half from the morning, settling at 7 qian, 4 cents, 6 hao, and 2.5 hu. "Silver Sycee Exchange" (銀拆) was 4 fen (分) for both the morning and afternoon markets, seemingly better than the previous day by 2 fen. Adding a premium for clipped silver and water content was also common, with rates of 7-8 fen. This slightly improved situation, after a long period of relaxed credit conditions, is likely difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" (銀欵) received by banks were significantly lower compared to the days before the market closure. Foreign banks received over 3.1 million in drafts, while Chinese banks received over 2.1 million. Goods receipts amounted to 3.2-3.3 million, and remittance receipts were 1.3-1.4 million. Foreign banks had over 600,000 in mortgage loans, while Chinese banks had only 300,000. Additionally, over 4 million was received in special funds, foreign currency, and miscellaneous funds. Foreign firms deposited 700,000 into warehouses, while Chinese firms withdrew 1 million. Money shops and silver firms received over 26.6 million in receipts, silver clipping premium receipts were over 4.22 million, inter-regional remittances were over 900,000, and cash receipts were 7-800,000. "Foreign Currency" (洋欵) remittance drafts were made at 610,000 in the morning market and 411,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 55,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Furthermore, off-market banknotes were transacted at 105,000 in the afternoon market. Check transactions were 75,000 in the morning and 60,000 in the afternoon. Bank inflows and outflows were 500,000 in the morning and 400,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions with foreign clients amounted to over 2.1 million, and banknote receipts and disbursements were over 2 million. Money shops received over 6.2-6.3 million in foreign currency, and foreign currency premium receipts were 1.8-1.9 million. Interbank lending of foreign currency was 1.6-1.7 million, inflows from the Yangtze River region were over 500,000, mainland freight was over 300,000, and small money shop transactions were over 600,000.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Early in the morning, Jiangnan small silver coins were bought by cocoon merchants, causing the price to rise by 4 cents, reaching 6 qian, 1 fen, and 9 cents. Afternoon trading was quiet, so the price did not move. Transactions totaled 7,500 jiao (角) in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. Early in the morning, Guangdong small silver coins were 6 qian, 3 cents, and 7.5 hao, and in the afternoon, they were 6 qian, 3 cents, and 3.75 hao. Overall, they seemed to have risen by about 2 cents compared to the previous afternoon. Transactions totaled 115,000 jiao in the morning and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were slightly short by 500 wen (文), estimated at 415,000,000 wen.</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Glimpse of Silver, Foreign Currency, and Goods Activity in the Last Two Days <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Over the past two days, foreign banks on the Bund have expanded their business operations as the market closure period had passed. With the Shanghai settlement signed, people's hearts have been greatly reassured. Letters and telegrams for purchasing goods from various ports have been exchanged frequently, and telegraphic and mail remittances have also arrived in a continuous stream. Foreign merchants have received no less than 1 million in electronic transfers, while Chinese merchants have also received 5-600,000. Consequently, the export of goods has also flourished, especially the import of foreign goods, which has been significant, leading to substantial customs revenue. Yesterday's customs revenue was as high as 6-700,000. The vigorous flow of goods has naturally created a need for silver and foreign currency, but the ample reserves have prevented the market from being significantly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Securities Rise and Fall, Transactions Are Sluggish <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Bonds Enter a Stagnant State</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market conditions at the Chinese Securities Exchange were still quiet. Spot transactions included 20,000 yuan in demobilization bonds, 15,000 yuan in 1919 Customs Consolidated Tax bonds, and 12,000 yuan in 1919 Salt Revenue bonds. The remaining transactions were only in the thousands of yuan. The futures market remained sluggish. The market sentiment on both the buying and selling sides continued to be extremely depressed throughout the day. The morning trading volume was over 1.8 million, and the afternoon trading volume was over 900,000 yuan, totaling 2.81 million yuan. Consolidated Salt Revenue bonds accounted for 5-600,000 each, 1920 Customs bonds accounted for about 400,000, and the others were only over 100,000 yuan each. Although the Sino-Japanese Shanghai Incident Agreement has been signed, the market sentiment is still difficult to be optimistic due to numerous rumors about the domestic situation. Major players are generally watching from the sidelines as before. The market situation continues to be quite depressed, with mostly small-scale transactions. The prices of various bonds are very stable, with supply and demand in equilibrium. The fluctuations throughout the day were mostly only around half a yuan. As a result, there were mutual rises and falls compared to the previous day. Except for the June 1920 Salt Revenue futures, which rose by about 1 yuan, and the 1919 Customs spot bonds, which fell by 1.6 yuan, and the 1919 Good Customs spot bonds, which fell by a small 0.7-0.8 yuan each, there were no major changes.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Yarn Market Falls for Three Consecutive Days <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Possibility of a Turnaround</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is showing signs of improvement. After falling for three consecutive days, dropping significantly by 4-5 liang (兩) from the opening price, some profiteers seized the opportunity to buy short, causing the market sentiment to rebound slightly. In addition, with the signing of the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement, market sentiment suddenly tightened, leading to a shortage of sellers in the market. As a result, the market situation suddenly became firm. However, there is still no overly optimistic expectation for the overall trend, as the inventory of various factories in the market is too large, the Northeast war is fierce, and credit conditions cannot be fully revitalized. How can commerce turn around? However, the tendered yarn price is already 6-7 liang cheaper than the current yarn market price, but outsiders, considering the still deteriorating environment, have not abandoned the idea of shorting.</p>
<p>Man-Tender Scattered Shorts Covered: In the morning opening of Man-Tender (人標), the market sentiment was better due to the rise in American cotton and good news about the situation. The situation was slightly tight, with more buyers. Scattered shorts covered, with various months rising by 8-9 qian to 1 liang. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was not smooth, and the market situation turned weak again. Near-month contracts fell by 3.1 qian, and far-month contracts rose by 1.4 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 6,300 bales. Among them, Hengyi sold 350 bales, Changfeng sold 350 bales, Dachang sold 400 bales, Jifeng sold 150 bales, Taichang sold 400 bales, and Yichang sold 250 bales. Senkang bought 150 bales, Mingde bought 250 bales, Tianjiang bought 200 bales, Ruida bought 150 bales, Yiyu bought 350 bales, and Dachang bought 150 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot Sales Gradually Improving: Spot yarn sales are becoming more active, but large-scale transactions are still lacking. According to statistics, various merchant groups bought a total of 108 bales throughout the day. The market conditions varied. The merchant groups from Zhenjiang bought 10 bales, Weihaiwei bought 70 bales, Shantou bought 40 bales, Sichuan bought 190 bales, Jiangxi bought 10 bales, Shantou bought 125 bales, Guangdong bought 55 bales, Changsha bought 10 bales, the mainland bought 105 bales, Ningbo bought 90 bales, Fujian bought 5 bales, and counterparts bought 25 bales.

<p>The cotton market rebounded and the situation was tighter. As the yarn market strengthened, the cotton market rose further. American cotton rose for two consecutive days, and inventories were low. Sources from various regions were scarce. Although the market had cleared actual demand, new sellers were wary in this era of old cotton and were unwilling to act rashly. However, judging from the overall trend of foreign cotton, it is still average, and no drastic changes have been found for the time being.</p>
<p>Zheng-Tender (鄭標) Up 3-4 Qian: In the morning opening of Zheng-Tender, the market sentiment was tighter due to the rise in American cotton for several days and the good yarn market. Various months in Shanghai rose by 2-3 qian. In the afternoon, the situation was calmer, rising by 5 fen to 1 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 12,600 dan (擔), compared to 8,800 dan on the previous day.

<p>Raw Cotton Consumption Continues to Be Thin: Spot flower trading is extremely depressed, and factory demand is completely disappointed. Although Japanese factories have all started operations, they have sufficient reserves of Indian and American cotton in terms of raw materials, and their own cotton inventories are also mostly full. Therefore, they are buying very little. The prices for spot cotton sold are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Huoji Flower: 29.50, Longmao bought 280 bales. Taicang Flower for spot delivery to the factory: 30.00, Gengfeng bought 500 bales, delivery in Wuxi.</p>

<p>British Cotton Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened following Liverpool telegraphic news, but then firmed due to buying by industry peers and short covering. Futures rose by 3-5 points, and spot rose by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 6-7 points, and spot fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 15 points. Indian cotton was suspended from trading. The original telegram record is on the left (telegram dated the 5th):</p>

<p>Recently, American cotton imports have remained substantial. According to customs reports, from March 1st to 3rd, over those three days, 11,025 bales of American cotton were imported, equivalent to 38,373 dan. However, there was also a lot of American cotton shipped out of Shanghai during these three days, with 1,424 bales, equivalent to 4,576 dan, shipped to Hankou, 1,000 bales, equivalent to 3,314 dan, shipped to Qingdao, and 250 bales, equivalent to 902 dan, shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Food Market in Shanghai River Rice Market Stable <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Southern: Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived at the Southern City district. Transactions from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang were the most common. The prices increased several times. The demand for Pingwang and Northern Rough Rice was also not bad. The early morning market price dropped by a small 5 fen, but by the afternoon, it had fallen by nearly a jiao (角). Yangdu Glutinous Rice was sold as soon as it arrived, with no ups and downs. The early Bo-dao Rice market was weak and tired, with few Yinyuan goods available. Tea shops had slightly more business, and the price rose by about a jiao.</p>
<p>Northern Shanghai: Yesterday, there were 7-80 ships from various sources at the Northern City district. The demand from urban and rural areas was weaker than the previous day. The top-quality Changzhou Wuxi Northern Rice was scarce, but there were still many mid-grade goods, and the price was down by nearly a jiao. The Xiangzhuang merchant groups were purchasing the three types of Bo-dao Rice: early rice and Feilaifeng. The price remained the same as the original market price. The market for Yanglu Glutinous Rice had neither glory nor disgrace. River factories were opening for 4,000 shi (石) of various goods per unit.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained firm. Merchants from Jiangbei, Chongming, and other inland regions were all preparing to ship goods into the market, and there was also outgoing traffic. However, Hankou did not inquire. Small milled rice and brown rice continued to be imported in small quantities, so the market situation turned to an equilibrium between arrival and sales. If there is a large demand from various regions in the future, the market may have a real prospect of improving. The total market transaction volume for small milled rice was over 3,000 bags, with prices ranging from 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 3 fen, 3 li (釐) to 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 jiao, 5 fen. There were also 600 bags of brown rice at 9 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen. 300 bags of Karachi brown rice were priced at 9 yuan, 6 jiao. Over 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 11 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen. 200 tons of small milled rice for May delivery were priced at 5 liang.</p>

<p>Northern Merchants Returned... New Purchases Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued to plunge as Northern merchants returned goods and new purchases were stagnant. Everyone was dumping and selling, and market sentiment was weak. The opening price for the current month's military ship flour was as low as 2 liang, 0 jiao, 3 fen, 5 li, and it continued to fall step by step, reaching as low as 2 liang, 0 jiao, 1 fen, 2.5 li. The opening price for Red and Blue Car flour was 2 liang, 0 jiao, 4 fen, but no one inquired about it. Someone sold it for 2 liang, 0 jiao, 2 fen, but no one bought it. Fortress (炮台) flour fell to 1 liang, 9 qian, 9 fen, 7.5 li. Although there were no transactions for the other brands, the market prices had all fallen to around 2 liang. Foreign wheat telegrams showed no major ups and downs, with only fluctuations of 1 jiao and 7-8 fen.</p>

<p>Fine Silk Opens at $1.06, Coarse Silk at $0.82</p>
<p>Due to the repeated and drastic falls in Japanese silk prices, the New York raw silk market was affected, and Chinese silk followed a weak trend. Cantonese silk prices are based on Japanese silk and its fluctuations, so the degree of the price drop was even greater. Fine filaments opened at only $1.06 per pound, and coarse filaments opened at $0.82, each falling by 6-7 jiao from the highest price.</p>

<p>The local foreign firms' silk market is lifeless. Although there are overseas silk telegrams forwarding to Shanghai, the incoming prices are still low. Chinese silk merchants' losses are too great, making it difficult to sell. The market sentiment continues to stagnate.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Qimen Baihao Price Reaches Its Peak <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Due to the tender tea buds that have been harvested in Qimen these past few days, shipments have not been abundant. Moreover, due to the cold and rainy weather these past couple days, tea buds are developing slowly. Due to the lack of sunshine, it is not advantageous to dry the tea, so most families have stopped picking tea, waiting for the weather to clear up and get warmer so tea buds can grow longer and continue to be harvested and processed. Because new tea has not officially entered the market, only 60-70% of the tea estates have started their harvest. In addition, it is difficult to transport the tea via the river transport to the port for export to foreign lands. Most firms are experiencing the difficulty of having goods but not enough money to procure them. Currently, most firms are preparing to procure money from the Qiupu region to purchase tea; however, this is just a drop in the bucket. Merchants that operate in Qiupu demand a high price for each thousand liang, raising the price to 1,300 yuan, which is a difference of 100 yuan in comparison to Jingdezhen/Tunxi. Tea firms are knowingly taking a loss but are helpless against the circumstances. Recently, a new harvest from Jiangjia river in Qimen was once bid at 110-120 yuan, but quickly fell to 80 yuan due to a lack of funds. The market price for raw Baihao is 230 yuan. The finished Gong tea would cost 400 yuan which is around 60-70 liang higher than last year. With the price reaching its peak, the current raw prices are unprecedented.</p>

<p>Wuyuan tea firms used to have over 300 farms in the whole town. With the northeast and two towns taking up the majority. This year, various firms have predicted the chaos stemming from nearby rebellions, difficulties in the river transport, and tight funds. Due to these difficulties, the firms are pessimistic towards the tea business. Recently, stock from factories in Shanghai has been sold, and foreign firms are in high demand, the tea production is important for the town and local farmers. The firms are forced to enter the market. By the latest count, aside from the new firms established in the towns of Zhangchun Jixianglong and Sikou Yitaixiang and 3-4 factories that have moved to the northeast side, the number of firms has stayed the same in the west. In the south side,玉坦·太白·中雲 and other tea firms are nearby the rebel areas, with 20 firms fully shut down with no opening. There are a few firms planning to move to the northeast to operate. In total, 20 firms from the 4 towns have decreased.</p>

<p>2,000 Bags Offered in the Morning Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market at the Sugar Association was active. Dutch No. 24 coarse sand and white sugar traded at 12 liang and 8 qian and 5 fen. High-quality goods were priced at 12 liang and 9 qian. Hong Kong goods were priced at 12 liang, 6 qian, 8 fen, 7.5 li to 12 liang and 7 qian.

HM mark was priced at 13 liang and 7 qian and 5 fen, and transactions occurred. The market sentiment was quite lively. The morning market saw Jianji offer over 1,900 bags of spot Hong Kong coarse sand and white sugar, priced at 12 liang and 7 qian. The merchants showed a strong interest in buying, and the transactions were quickly cleared. The market was very active.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of preserved peaches from various regions have been extremely sluggish. In addition, the weather is getting warmer, and there is a risk of spoilage. Therefore, land prices and market prices have continued to fall, reaching the lowest level. They are extremely cheap. The highest quality goods are only 20 liang, and the next best are 16-17 liang. It was recently heard that a certain firm, seeing that market prices were already low, specially bought a batch from Hankou, with costs only around 16 liang, and the quality was still respectable. There is hope for a large fall followed by a small rebound in the market.</p>

<p>Key Instigators to Be Detained for Investigation and Handling</p>
<p>Senior Normal School Grade 3 to Be Expelled; Junior High Resumes Classes</p>
<p>Since Xue Zhongtai took over as principal of Jiangsu Provincial Xuzhou High School, his management has been quite serious. Recently, students in the Senior Normal School Grade 3 class requested that the school subsidize their field trip expenses. Xue submitted a report to the Education Department, stating that due to the national crisis and traffic disruptions in the province, many schools in the Beijing-Shanghai area have not been proceeding as usual. All field trips for this year's schools should be suspended. However, the students still requested to go to Shandong and Beiping, demanding even higher fees. Xue, unable to disobey the Education Department's order and facing severe financial difficulties, repeatedly tried to reason with the students, but they ignored him. The students in the class initially threatened to suspend their studies as a whole, then incited all high school students to occupy the two campuses, expel faculty and staff, and force the principal to leave. They also submitted a petition to the Education Department in the name of all students, attacking the principal. The Education Department deemed that the students' unreasonable coercion and incitement of a strike were extreme actions beyond the pale, so it not only issued a stern rebuke to the students but also telegraphed the Jinpu Garrison Command and the Tongshan County Chief to assist in strict handling. It also ordered the Provincial Supervisor Yi Zuolin to go to the school, detain the key instigators for investigation and handling, and expel all students involved in the turmoil in that class. Their security deposits will be deducted, and they will be required to repay all food and lodging expenses. The other high school students who supported the trouble-making, causing the turmoil to escalate, should be temporarily dissolved as a whole. As for the junior high students, they were ordered to resume classes immediately. According to the Education Department, it will spare no sacrifices and overcome any difficulties to investigate and handle the matter strictly to thoroughly rectify the situation and reverse the uproar.</p>

<p>Since the Education Department appointed Zhao Guangtao as the preparatory director to start preparations for the Jiangsu Provincial Xuzhou People's Education Center, progress has been quite rapid. Last year, the Education Department sent Section Chief Yu Qingting to Xuzhou to survey the site, which was located between the northeast two stations, purchasing 21 mu (畝) of land for 3,500 yuan. After three months of active preparation, and with the Education Department appointing Zhao Guangtao as the director, the official opening ceremony was held on May 1st. As the new site is still under construction, the ceremony was temporarily held at the preparatory office. The ceremony was simple, and representatives from various agencies and organizations attended, as well as township chiefs. During this time of national crisis and disaster, it is fortunate to witness this educational construction. According to investigations, the center has now established two experimental zones in the Bajie and Xiadian areas of the suburbs. The people's school has opened three classes, with a total of 150 students. Two reading rooms have been established, and ten bulletin boards have been set up. A credit cooperative has been established, as well as two joint farmers' loan associations. 10,000 trees have been planted on barren hills. The social surveys, agricultural surveys, and industrial surveys of the experimental zones have also been completed and are being compiled. Specially contracted people's tea gardens and industrial training classes are also being prepared and established. An anti-Japanese exhibition and an agricultural exhibition are being prepared, as well as a village citizen improvement association in the experimental zone, etc., which can be expected to be completed soon. It is heard that the center focuses on rural people's education, aiming for the balanced development of intelligence among urban and rural people, not limited to urban people's education.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Shanghai Municipal Council Subsidy for Chinese Private Schools in the Concession Must Be Approved by the Municipal Education Bureau <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, an education reporter, concerned about reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council's subsidy for Chinese private schools in the concession seemed to be related to Chinese educational rights, interviewed an important official of the Municipal Education Bureau for inquiries. The following is a record of the conversation: The Shanghai Municipal Council previously planned to subsidize Chinese private schools in the concession and sought the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. The Municipal Education Bureau submitted its compiled opinions to the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government for instructions. It then sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting them to follow the instructions, but has not yet received a reply and cannot implement it immediately. According to the previous results of the Education Bureau's decision with the Municipal Council, Chinese schools established in the concession, if they have been registered or approved by the Education Bureau for trial operation, must first submit an application to the Education Bureau for approval before the Education Bureau can forward it to the Municipal Council for consent in order to obtain the Municipal Council's subsidy. However, yesterday (the 6th), various newspapers suddenly published two articles on the Municipal Council's subsidy for Chinese private schools in the concession, with a statement that "schools that have not been registered can directly apply to the Superintendent of Education at the Municipal Council and obtain a blank application form for completion." The Education Bureau believes that subsidizing private schools that have not been approved for registration or trial operation violates the Ministry's regulations for private schools. This record is quite misleading. It is heard that the Education Bureau will wait for the Municipal Council's reply and completion of the procedures before notifying all private schools in the Public Concession to implement the measure. In addition to the Municipal Council's proposed subsidy for private schools, the Education Bureau also has procedures for applying for subsidy fees approved by the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government, which will be notified to all schools at that time. It is hoped that the schools will not be misled by yesterday's news.</p>

<p>Inviting the British Crown Prince to Attend</p>
<p>Athletes to Have Freedom of Entry</p>
<p>The Organizing Committee of the World Games, with the Games approaching daily, recently held a plenary meeting of all staff in Los Angeles and announced two important recent developments:</p>
<p>1.  The World Games has sent a letter to the British Foreign Office, requesting it to forward an invitation to Prince Wales of the British Crown, inviting him to come to the United States and participate in the grand event, adding luster to the Games. The Prince has agreed and will depart for Los Angeles in June this year.</p>
<p>2.  Since the implementation of the Immigration Act in the United States, foreign nationals entering the country must undergo considerable inspection procedures. To facilitate the entry of athletes from various countries, the Games previously petitioned US Secretary of State Stimson, requesting the waiver of entry procedures for athletes from various countries. The State Department has approved the request, and it has been signed by President Hoover.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Signing Before the Bed <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>The peace conference has concluded. The ceasefire agreement has been transcribed and sent to the representatives of both sides to sign "before the bed." Patriotic groups are constantly shouting their opposition. However, the general public, who deeply love peace, are undoubtedly offering "sincere prayers" there.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is the phrase "before the bed." Tang poetry says, "Moonlight before the bed, I suspect it is frost on the ground. I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown." Now, I wonder if our representatives, when signing before the bed, thought of this Tang poem and then thought of our "hometown." What thoughts did they have in their hearts?</p>
<p>The Zuo Zhuan says, "Words spoken in the bedroom shall not cross the threshold." Because words spoken in the bedroom should only be spoken in bed, they must be kept absolutely secret. Now, this "peace conference" has always been held in "secrecy" from beginning to end. Because it is secret, the signing must also be done in bed.</p>
<p>The representatives of China and Japan are both signing in bed because they are injured. I think it would be good to place the two beds side by side and have a "night talk in connected beds, with feet touching." Unfortunately, both Ambassador Chongguang and Lieutenant General Ueda have injured feet. It would be a little inconvenient to touch "feet."</p>
<p>As I wrote this, a pedantic Mr. Er saw it and said, "No wonder the two governments have always talked about 'Sino-Japanese friendship.' It turns out that the two are really very good together. As the saying goes, 'Don't try to stop a couple from fighting. Just need a bed...' Now, China and Japan have been fighting for months. Sure enough, they just did this on the 'bed,' and then they got better again." I couldn't help but laugh when I heard this. Oh, so that's how it is.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Free Aphorisms <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiang</p>
<p>An Englishman's love of freedom is like his legally wedded wife, whose wedding was held in a church and formally officiated by a pastor. She entirely, is something that belongs to him. Perhaps because home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers, he may not treat her very tenderly. However, he will never relax his reasonable and adequate protection of her and is very willing to be responsible for her to the end.</p>
<p>In the eyes of a Frenchman, freedom is simply as lovely as the lover he privately loves. To take the analogy a step further, a Frenchman views freedom like a pretty and moving wild rose. It has brilliant colors, it also has a rich fragrance, and it has a sweet taste. But ah, it is covered with sharp thorns. If you are not careful, it may break the skin. However, a lecherous Frenchman, for the sake of freedom, will go through fire and water, and sacrifice himself, no matter what the sacrifice. Indeed, he is obsessed with freedom.</p>
<p>Let's talk about a German. His attitude toward freedom is exactly like treating his old grandmother. That is to say, he only respects it solemnly and does not love it passionately.</p>
<p>Although that's how it is said, who can predict the changes in the world?</p>
<p>When an Englishman gets angry, he may harden his heart and give his wife a beating or a scolding, deeply trampling on her.</p>
<p>The Frenchman, then, is even more dangerous. The weeds and wildflowers in the alleys and streets exert an irresistible attraction, making it possible for him to abandon his lover at any time. Indeed, in France, finding a new lover is not a difficult thing.</p>
<p>But the German will never have this kind of bad temper or do this kind of ungrateful thing. He will not be very cold to his old grandmother. He wants his beloved and respected old grandmother to always rest on the sofa in the living room. There, she can tell some fairy tales to her grandchildren.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>When the League of Nations investigation team went to the three northeastern provinces, our country sent Mr. Gu Weijun as a representative to accompany them. It was right and proper. However, Japan instigated the puppet state to repeatedly and firmly reject this. Their opposition to China and disregard for the League of Nations is clearly visible. Zhang Taiyan's last words encouraged Mr. Gu with the examples of Hong Hao and Zuo Maodi. Mr. Gu's reply was also subtle. Zuo Maodi was an envoy sent by the Ming Prince of Fu to the Qing court. He was detained in the north. Upon hearing of the fall of Jiangnan, he did not eat for seven days. The Qing regent summoned him. Maodi, wearing mourning clothes, a filial cap, and straw sandals, bowed deeply to the regent, sitting facing south. The regent listed his five major crimes: falsely establishing the Prince of Fu, colluding with bandits, not submitting national credentials, and killing the governor without authorization. Maodi argued, only asking for death. He refused to shave his head. He was killed on June 19. He wrote a poem before his death: "The gorge is split, the nest is sealed, the return path is far. The traveling clouds go south, what is the intention? The inch of red heart and cold spirit cannot be exhausted, it will turn into smoke and clouds and will not be ground down." His followers Chen Yongji and Wang Yibin and others all died for their principles. Although Zuo Maodi was a scholar, he was able to face death calmly, without humiliation to the barbarian. As the saying goes, "A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated." His high moral integrity is admirable. I wonder if Mr. Gu today can also encourage himself in this way.</p>

<p>Chapter Six: Pitifully, They Were Forced into a Bedside Alliance on the Night of a Shared Dream, Still Recalling the First Love When They Broke the Window Pact</p>
<p>Liang Xiaoyun said loudly, "That won't do. Can this kind of relationship be casually talked about with a laugh? If I say it too shallowly, people will suspect I'm just meddling. They might not agree. If I say it more deeply, then, according to this situation, what exactly are the two of us? Mom vaguely told people like that. I would lose too much face." An Yutian was secretly shocked. Of course, he had already heard the meaning in her words, but he thought the relationship was too important, so he didn't want to make an obvious expression first. He pretended to be foolish and said, "You are much more capable than I am in social matters. Please estimate what kind of statement would be appropriate and say it that way. Okay?" Liang Xiaoyun, hearing that he dared to be so sly, went straight to the attack. She said, "Of course, there is a very appropriate way to say it, but that is a matter of proper status and cannot be casually said as a joke. It requires both of us to be sincerely willing to get things done. As for me, I ask myself that I have been good to you. You, on the other hand, are too unreliable, only wanting methods from me. Fine. Tell me to estimate how to say it and then say it. I don't even want to say it!" Seeing that she was getting angry, An Yutian also felt that he couldn't bear to let her down. And he could not afford to miss this extraordinary encounter, so he tightly grasped her arm and sincerely begged, "Don't misunderstand. I am very grateful for your kindness to me. How could I still want any methods from you? It's just that I dare not ask for too much, and I am awkward with words and can't say anything. Now, please tell me frankly. No matter what the method, I will accept it with twelve points of sincerity and respect, without any objection." Liang Xiaoyun suddenly raised half of her body, and from her deep, sea-like eyes, she emitted two clear and passionate rays of light. Staring at An Yutian, she solemnly asked, "Really? Do you mean that no matter what, you will follow me very sincerely?" An Yutian nodded on the pillow. Leaning against the bed railing, Liang Xiaoxiao said very gently, "My method is also very simple. It's just that I want to marry you. To be honest, I love you very much and have loved you for a long time. If the two of us cooperate sincerely as husband and wife, with your handsome appearance and brilliant talents, and with my assistance with subtle social skills and economic strength, why worry that we can't operate in today's military and political circles to achieve rapid success, achieving a good situation of husband's success and wife's glory? Even this time, when we start drilling into the door to see Governor Ye, as soon as I mention that I have married you, such a young husband, they will have to pay special attention."</p>

<h3 id="e161">After the Competition <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Since the city-wide primary and secondary schools "Patriotic Activity Achievement Competition" ended on December 12th last year, what work have we in the education sector done since then? Yesterday, I received a letter from the "Executive Committee of the Shanghai Educational Circle National Salvation Association," which included the following passage:</p>
<p>"...Now that the war has ceased, and the sound of cannons is gradually fading, most schools have reopened, and the spirit of running around to save the country before has become slightly quiet again. This association has repeatedly received letters from various parties mentioning this matter, all saying that the Shanghai education community has not been very passionate about national salvation work recently..."</p>
<p>After reading this passage, I felt very ashamed in my heart. Our education sector has indeed cooled down a lot regarding national salvation work since the "Patriotic Activity Achievement Competition" ended. Now, we can hardly find any national salvation work in the education sector. This is also the "five minutes" of the education sector.</p>
<p>If the intellectual class is like this, what is there to blame for the general奸商? Therefore, the uneducated class is willing to betray the country, and the educated class is the same way willing to betray the country. Does everyone know Zheng Xiaoxu, the Manchurian探花 who directly served as a Manchurian slave and indirectly served as a Japanese婢? He cannot be said to be uneducated, and he cannot be said to be illiterate. Does everyone also know Zhao Xinbo, a Japanese doctor of law in Shenyang who was a tiger for Japan in checking and banning the current primary school textbooks? He is even less uneducated and even less illiterate. Therefore, past acts of treason were entirely carried out by the intellectual class, and perhaps the future loss of the country will be at the hands of the intellectual class.</p>
<p>China's poverty and weakness are entirely due to the general teachers. The Franco-Prussian War and the Russo-Japanese War, although they fought for victory at the time, were already sown in peacetime. That is, Japan's aggressive ideas also penetrated the hearts of the people through education, making the Japanese people habitually right what is wrong, not feeling that it is aggression. Almost all Japanese primary and secondary school students take it for granted to occupy our country's territory. This is the effect of Japan's extreme patriotic education. Now, our country's foreign troubles are more urgent than any other country, and the survival of the nation is at stake. Looking at the masses, everyone still has their own ideas. Even the general teachers, although they have patriotic ideas, are also superficial and unrealistic. This is the most tragic phenomenon. Past mistakes, such as yesterday's death. I deeply hope that our education sector, from today onwards, will think at all times: How to plan national salvation methods to be effective? How to take on national salvation work to be practical? How to unite colleagues? How to guide students? How to use spare time and energy? In short, patriotism is not a one-time thing.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Sugar <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>Sugar is something that we cannot live without in our lives. The reason why our human body generates body temperature is because of carbohydrates and fats (carbohydrates are the general term for starch and sugar). Carbohydrates combine with oxygen in the body and give us the ability to perform various tasks. Each of us normally needs 13 and a half taels of carbohydrates every day to have enough strength to work.</p>
<p>There are three types of raw materials for sugar production: sugarcane, beet, and maple tree. The places in the world that produce cane sugar are Cuba, Guangdong and Fujian in our country. The places that produce beet sugar are Germany and France, and the places that produce maple sugar are Canada and the United States. Our country does not produce beet sugar or maple sugar, only a small amount of cane sugar is produced. Now, because the space is very short, the production of beet and maple sugar, etc., will be discussed later, only cane sugar production will be discussed. According to Tiangong Kaiwu, our country did not know how to produce sugar before. It was not until the Dali period of the Tang Dynasty (1146 years before the Republic of China) that a Western monk Zou traveled to Suining County, Sichuan, and began to spread the method of planting sugarcane and making sugar. The current method of making sugar is to first press the sugarcane juice out, then filter it with lime milk, and put the clarified sugar liquid in a vacuum pot to cook. Why put it in a vacuum pot to cook? When we boil water on the high mountains, the water boils when it reaches 80-90 degrees Celsius, because the air is thin on the high mountains and the pressure is low. Cooking in a vacuum pot can save time and coal. Therefore, a vacuum pot is used to evaporate. After evaporation, wait for it to cool and crystallize into raw sugar. This raw sugar is dissolved, filtered with bone ash, and then put into a vacuum pot to cook. After cooling, it becomes pure white sugar.</p>
<p>Our country's recent annual production of sugar is 200,000 tons, and consumption is 1,000,000 tons.</p>

<p>Hua'er's illness has reached a very dangerous period. The parents in Washington are so worried that they have invited many famous doctors to their home to treat him.</p>
<p>After taking the pulse and measuring the temperature, many doctors gathered together to discuss the method of treatment.</p>
<p>A said, "The patient's body is too weak. It is best to take more tonic medicines, such as ginseng, deer antler, ... the more the better. This is a 'comprehensive plan' method."</p>
<p>B said, "No, the reason for his illness is due to feeling external evil. Tonic medicines are completely inappropriate. It is better to use some releasing agents to implement a military expulsion of the disease demon."</p>
<p>C said, "The patient's temperature is very high. Hurry up and get some ice to cool him down and lower his temperature."</p>
<p>D said, "I think it is better to give him a few blood-replenishing injections to maintain his sick body so that he can resist the disease demon for a long time."</p>
<p>E said, "..."</p>
<p>You say a sentence, he says a sound, and gradually, from a gentle discussion, it turns into a fierce debate. Finally, they roll up their sleeves and fight with each other. After the parents in Washington persuaded them to leave, they sent them out one by one.</p>
<p>Hua'er sighed in bed, "If I don't take their prescriptions, I can still linger on. If I take their prescriptions, I am sure to lose my life immediately."</p>
<p>Day after day passed, and Hua'er's illness became more and more serious. Every day, several baskets of prescriptions were thrown out of the Washington mansion, which benefited Zhang Laoer, who sold groceries, who used them to wrap copper coins, wrap peanuts, and wrap everything.</p>

<p>丨丨The Crowd of Applicants</p>
<p>The Gu residence's messenger was now being summoned to the second young master's study. Usually, it wasn't easy for him to go to the young masters' rooms, but today was an exception. At the door, the large foreign parrot greeted him with a "Hello." As he entered, he heard a burst of the maid's laughter, after which he saw the maid coyly hiding towards the back room.</p>
<p>A wisp of smoke swirled in the green light reflected from the green leaves outside the window, and the blood-red roses in front of the steps boldly sent in their rich fragrance, along with the smiling face of the girl on the wall; everything deepened the richness of spring. He thought,</p>
<p>"Ah! The young master is truly blessed!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the second young master was fixing his tie in front of the dressing mirror, then applying a little Stanco pomade, so his black hair shone with a dark luster. Afterwards, the young master noticed the messenger waiting for his orders, so he solemnly said:</p>
<p>"There will be quite a few women coming today. Bring the pretty and young ones to see me. If too many come, just bring one in every half hour. Tell the rest to come back tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Yes, young master! I understand."</p>
<p>In fact, the messenger was completely baffled. However, since he had received the young master's order, he had to execute it carefully; there was nothing to say. Fortunately, he saw the maid who usually served the second young master walking in from outside in the courtyard. So, with a smile, he inquired, and learned that the second young master had placed an advertisement in the newspaper yesterday, seeking a female secretary. As for the young master saying he wanted someone "young and pretty," he knew what this female secretary would be used for.</p>
<p>"Humph! The young master really knows how to have fun."</p>
<p>When he returned to the door, he saw a female student in a skirt already waiting for him. He thought, "That was fast! Business has arrived." But although this first one was young, she wasn't very pretty. However, since this was the first of the day, he would take her in once.</p>
<p>"Are you here to apply for the secretary position?" the messenger asked.</p>
<p>"Yes!" The girl blushed.</p>
<p>"Then go see the young master."</p>
<p>When the messenger returned the second time, there were two more waiting at the door. Soon another came in. This was really bad. Three had come all at once, which one should he take in first? And there was still one inside who hadn't come out.</p>
<p>"I think you should come back tomorrow afternoon. Our young master hasn't gotten up yet."</p>
<p>"Ah?" One by one, they had to dejectedly turn away.</p>
<p>But then young and pretty ones came along. Then filled with tears, they went back. Only those who happened to be at the door just as the young master released one, and immediately filled the spot, could meet the young master; they were truly extremely lucky. Afterwards, applicants continued to come and continued to leave. Those in skirts, those in qipaos, and those in high-heeled leather shoes. Young ones, pretty ones. Until the evening, there were at least over twenty.</p>
<p>The first day was like this, the second day was like this, and the third day was still like this. He thought, "I wonder whose luck is good enough to get a job here." But a week later, he heard the maid in the second young master's room say:</p>
<p>"The young master is really having fun, women keep him company all day long; he's thinking of doing it again next month!"</p>

<h3 id="e166">Taking Advantage of the Disaster <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Ge</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, all businesses have been at a standstill, especially those in the war zone, which have suffered heavy losses. As a result, many have declared bankruptcy and are being liquidated. However, there are also some who take advantage of this opportunity to deliberately dissolve their businesses, blaming it on the war, in order to seize unexpected profits.</p>
<p>A friend of mine had ordered a suit from the ×× Tailor Shop on North Sichuan Road before the war broke out. When the time came to pick it up, after paying in full, he discovered some discrepancies and asked them to modify it. Unexpectedly, the incident occurred that night, and he was unable to retrieve the suit for a long time. When the situation calmed down slightly, he went back to pick it up, but all the items in the store had been moved away. Only a notice was posted on the wall, roughly stating:</p>
<p>"Due to the great losses caused by the recent war, all goods have been looted, making it impossible to resume business. Therefore, we have no choice but to declare dissolution. We hope for your forgiveness."</p>
<p>The next day, an advertisement was published in the newspaper, saying: "Due to the Shanghai war, all items in the store were looted, resulting in heavy losses and making it impossible to resume business. Therefore, according to the resolution of the shareholders' meeting, we hereby announce the dissolution. All former colleagues are kindly requested to seek other employment and not to waste any more time and effort."</p>
<p>My friend sighed, thinking it was just bad luck, and decided not to pursue the matter. Unexpectedly, they ran into each other on Xiafei Road in the French Concession. He saw that the shop had reorganized and resumed business. The only difference was that the word "Branch" was added below the old name. My friend was very angry and went inside to question them. He found that not only was the counter the same as before, but all the staff had not changed either. After a long period of questioning, even banging on chairs and tables, the shop assistant led him upstairs, where he saw suits piled up like a mountain. In the end, he returned in triumph. Another friend had a similar experience with repairing a watch. Alas! Where is the conscience in "taking advantage of the disaster"?</p>

<h3 id="e167">Student Life During National Crisis <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Chinese schools in Zhabei all moved to the "safe area" to hold classes. The so-called safe area refers to the Shanghai concessions. It merely uses the protection of foreigners to prevent the schools from being affected by the war. This fact is very painful. Now I will talk about the lives of the students.</p>
<p>Most of the students live outside the school, because the school cannot rent many houses for students to live in. Life outside the school is very free. Not only do they not need to ask for leave to enter and exit, but their actions are also not restricted by the instructors. They can ask someone to attend class for them and play outside all day, and it doesn't matter. In the afternoon, they can stroll in the park for three or four hours, both to pursue the opposite sex and to relax their minds. At night, they play mahjong, saying it is to practice social skills, as a tool for serving society in the future. Gambling is very permissive in the safe area, and they will not be restricted by the outside world, so they gamble to their heart's content until dawn. Movie theaters and dance halls are places they frequent. They do not ask about national crises or imperialist aggression. Anyway, the country</p>
<p>doesn't belong to them personally.</p>
<p>What I have described above is certainly the life of some students. But this situation is increasingly expanding, like a contagious disease, spreading from a few people to many people. If they have not been vaccinated, it is very difficult to avoid it.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Yesterday, we received a submission from Meng Ping entitled "Student Life During National Crisis." I do not know whether the life of students is really like this in some aspects. However, students are the masters of our country in the future, and the fate of the country depends entirely on the students. Therefore, publishing it here is also with the intention of correcting it if it is true, and encouraging it if it is not.</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>

<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>A and B were drinking together on the afternoon of May 5th.</p>
<p>A: Great, Shanghai won't have another war. The ceasefire agreement was signed yesterday.</p>
<p>B: Although the government has repeatedly stated that it will never sign treaties that betray our country and humiliate our nation, I'm still a bit skeptical.</p>
<p>A: Put your mind at ease! This is based on the resolution of the League of Nations, and it is also the government's so-called long-term resistance plan!</p>
<p>B: Hey! What long-term resistance? What final determination? Don't you see that the situation in the South is becoming urgent again?</p>
<p>A: You really don't understand. This is just practicing on our own, preparing to resist foreign aggression in the future!</p>
<p>B: Alas! In this vast land of China, I am grieving for the future!</p>
<p>A: Stop saying depressing things. Peace has been achieved. Let's have a drink to celebrate!</p>
<p>The two clinked glasses and drank, their hands slightly trembling, their eyes filled with tears, as if invaded by an inexplicable sorrow.</p>
