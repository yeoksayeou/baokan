<p>時評</p>
<h3>當前政治之急務</h3>
<p>— 翰</p>
<p>東北山河已在澈底的無抵抗主義之下而斷送高唱民主政治化之政府經數月之難產。甫入人世已露窘態。居今日而言政治惟有歏息居今日而言救國。惟有頓足。</p>
<p>有欲予評新政府之組織制度者。其迂闊臻於極。有欲予論新政府之經濟計劃者。亦可謂不識時務。夫政治爲衆人之事。無高深哲理可談。昔俾斯麥有言。「假若予大權在握。政績昭然。予可立即羅致一般政治學者。爲予創一新的政治學說。而傳誦於全世界。」我哲亦有「爲政不在多言」之訓。其看透政治之骨子有如此者。</p>
<p>我人若從政治學的基點加以觀察。則今日之政府。爲中國整個的紊亂狀態下之事實的政府。黨治民治之說。與事實根本不發生關係。苟言獨裁則遍閱各國政治史。在全國大紊亂之後。迪克推多之需要。已成歷史的公例。揆諸現代史。蘇俄與意大利。且以獨裁而治。法蘭西若無普恩加賚長期内閣之專政。則法國戰後經濟之復興。决難成功。而大戰後「民主政治之危機。」已爲各國朝野一致的呼聲。故在今日而論政治全在人爲。全在事實。而不僅在政制之若何變革。若徒拔去黨治之旗。另樹民治之幟。而謂即可遽臻上理。尙非根本之論。苟言政策。則「五年計劃」「十年計劃」等名詞决非目前中國將瀕於國亡家破。瓜分之禍逼在眉睫之亟務蘇俄自一九一七年十月革命以後。自軍事的共產時期以至新經濟政策時期其主要政務可得而言者。爲勘平内亂。爲安定社會經十年長期之奮鬥而後政基始固。而後五年經濟計劃。得於最近依次實現。而後五年計劃之實。現與第三國際之世界政策相呼應。使全世界之帝國主義者軍閥財閥。始而藐視。繼而狐疑。終於震撼不克自主。暴日佔我東北之急促。即爲此項關鍵下之影響。故在政治未入軌道社會未得安定之前。而言建設政策。而言經濟計劃。旣不切事實亦不合邏輯猶緣木而求魚。造宫殿於沙漠。等於痴人說夢而已。</p>
<p>今日之政治對象。爲天災人禍交逼而來之事實。爲河山破碎國境日蹙之景象。爲東北三千萬同胞淪爲亡國之奴隷。大江一帶億萬人民與天災掙扎。死無歸所之慘絶人寰的圖畫。爲軍閥官僚敲剥搜括。逼死人民之慘劇。爲惡霸稱雄好人絶跡之世界。苟有力之軍人。肯毅然率領國家之軍隊。進則收復失地。守則堅壁淸野。絶不予人以隙。已可爲唯一之模範軍人苟有心之士。肯毅然出入災區。拯救災民。犧牲個人之利樂。不顧個人之生死。即可稱唯一之大政治家。有人能大力闊斧。不顧社會之惡勢力。禁絶全國鴉片之種與吸。斷絶内亂循環之根源。延續民族瀕滅之生命。即可爲功德無量。今後唯一之政績有人能團結全國國家之軍隊集中全副實力與精神於國防與剿匪。使帝國主義者無隙可逞。使全國之土匪從此絶跡。即可爲萬家頂祝。千古不朽之事業。</p>
<p>國防固。土匪滅。災民蘇鴉片絶。於是民族有一線之生機。政治有入軌之希望。社會最低限度之安定可以實現。然後可以漸圖生聚敎養之建設大計。然後可以從容討論政制理論之長短。然後眞正的民主政治。可以獲得鞏固的基礎。否則徒以名詞騙人。徒以空論欺民。終日醉生夢死惟權位之得失是務。赫官羣僚。莫不存五日京兆之心。惟趕快囊括是務。則惟有促整個民族之速亡。中國將永遠不能爲「現代的國家」將從「次殖民地」整個而爲殖民地。華夏民族。將從此與埃及希臘等古族同朽矣。悲夫。</p>

<h3>新巿長吳鐵城昨就職</h3>
<p>中央國府均派員監誓</p>
<p>發表局長科長等人選</p>
<p>新任本巿巿長吳鐵城氏、於昨日上午十時、在楓林橋巿政府舉行宣誓就職典禮、中央黨部派陳壁君監誓、因病未到、國府代表孔祥熙、行政院代表陳羣、均到塲監誓、張前巿長亦有演說、來賓到千餘人、茲將各項詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>莊嚴之會塲　巿政府大門、懸黨國旗、大禮堂中懸總理遺像、兩旁爲來賓休息室、巿府路由巿公安局裝警士、放嚴密步哨、大門前由警察大隊車巡隊武裝站守、塲内由警察維持秩序、曁巿府職員担任招待、並由公安局軍樂隊奏樂、</p>
<p>吳鐵城宣誓　新巿長吳鐵城、高舉右手、宣誓云、余謹宣誓余恪遵總理遺囑、服從黨義、奉行法令、忠心及努力於本職、余决不妄費一錢、妄用一人、並决不營私舞弊、及賄受賂、如違背誓言、願受最嚴厲之處罰、此誓、</p>
<p>孔祥熙致詞　中央監誓員孔祥熙氏略謂、滬巿不特爲中國之首要商埠、亦爲世界之大都會、際茲國家多事、國難方殷、任長官者不但須負戊地方之重責只有應付外交之巨任、歴屆巿長、以張岳軍巿長任期最長、對於謀工商業之發達、及建設上之進展、均與巿府同人有切實之計劃、現又有巿中心區域之建設、張巿長因數年來努力奮鬥、故擬暫時休養、向中央懇切辭職、中央乃派吳鐵城先生長滬巿、吳氏追隨總理甚久、對黨員方面有深長之歴史、經騐學識俱極豐富、今任本巿巿長、不但爲巿民之福、亦爲黨國之幸、但本巿之發展、仍在巿民、故須巿民與吳巿長就職攝影（麗光攝）</p>
<p>之合作、庶對滬巿有良好之成總、現在國事多故、滬巿之一舉一動、尤須由巿民輔助而行始可、總理努力革命、其唯一目的、即欲實現三民主義、三民主義之最要者、即欲實現民主政治、由人民執行政權、將來應政完成之時、即民選實現之時、但此事須先從地方自治做起、兄弟很希望上海從自治上做起來、而完成地方自治、其責在固巿長、但須全上海巿民加以幫助、始可成功云云</p>
<p>陳人鶴致詞　行政院監誓員陳羣（人鶴）致詞、略謂吳巿長曩者任廣東香山縣長時、不由省長委任、而由大總統親予任命、此可證明香山縣長、已由大總統親自交代、其隆重爲何如、今就任巿長必能努力做去、現在有一般官僚、每多敷衍辦事、全國人民不能獲益、吳巿長必能不離民衆立塲辦事、希望吳巿長勿與滬巿少數之名流代表合作、而與眞正的全巿民合作云云、</p>
<h3>童行白致詞</h3>
<p>巿黨部代表童行白致詞、略謂、吳巿長與黨内關係密切、則任滬巿長後、必能使黨政工作之進行、更爲密切上海第六第七兩次代表大會議决最重要案凡二、㈠巿中心區之建設以前巿長對此曾費多日之心血、刻意經營以此非二三年即可完成者、須有十年二十年之努力、始能見效其關係不但得到工商業之發達、且可影響政治外交、故希望吳巿長早日完成、以慰滬民之望㈡對地方自治問題、民主政治乃建樂在地方自治上、故須有廣大的工農商民衆、從事於地方自治、始能達到眞正之民主政治、現祇聞人言民主政治、而不聞人言地方自治、實係舍本逐末之談、所以希望吳巿長對於地方自治、加以努力、使早日完成、俾巿民得參加民選之機會云云、</p>

<h3>救國三策</h3>
<p>— 張息羽</p>
<p>欲保破碎之河山收渙散</p>
<p>之人心禦當前之國難須首</p>
<p>先要求政府實施者有三</p>
<p>㈠廢除一黨治國之政策、代以全國賢人政治、綜寗粤桂系、東北系、西北系、及在野文武名流、犧牲前此個人權利、地盤思想、推舉雄才大略、曠達大度、公忠愛國者數人、總持綱要、建設健全政府、擬具施政方針、上下一心、萬衆同的、籌議應戰的具體方案、何以禦强暴、救危亡、何以集流散、安民衆、何以消匪共、固治安、謀而後動量而後入、其執行、能貫澈救國方針者、國人擁載之、其懷野心而圖個人之發展者、國人驅逐之、政府領導於前、人民力盾於後、同心同德、共赴國難、舉現時所謂省巿縣黨部者、嚴令解散、取消黨部開支國帑、及動用地方公欵、以節糜費、洶汰藉黨魚肉人民之惡劣分子、以消民怨、剷除武人　政惡習、杜其死灰復燃、夫如是天下之人、知政府大公無我、與人民有改絃更張以决心、渙汗大號、此其時也、</p>
<p>㈡組織國民救國議會　分設省會、縣會選全國全省全縣優秀分子、參預政治、籌議一切救國事宜、地方應興應革、監督各級政府、審議預算决算、政府之不盡職、可得彈劾改組之、庶政公諸輿論、萬幾握於中樞、個人之專横可弭、政治之淸明有日、如以一黨獨握政權、已貽誤國人墮於亡國亡種之痛一系失敗、彼之一系、取而代之、所謂朋分主義者、未必不再演於來日、黄臺之瓜、何堪再摘、人心不死、宜此次舉國靑年學子、耆老遺逸、莫不奔走號泣、督促政府起而救亡、而頇顢之政府一、籌未展、僅仰國聯之鼻息、以期倖免錦州若亡、關外淪胥華北繼陷、共管之局立現吾恐欲爲南渡偏安、立一小朝廷而不可得也、</p>
<p>㈢整頓軍實、　吾國士兵據現時統計、約二百萬人并土匪式之雜牌軍隊、及地方團丁、不止此數、今宜通令全國軍人汰去老弱挑選精壯、以一兵一槍爲單位、由中央組織編遣會、分頭編置、按國防情實、財政能力、分編若干師、爲國防軍具有確切之戰鬥力者、分期開赴前敵、以應國難、同時劃一部分軍力、淸剿匪共、此一時治標之策、若根本之圖、非實行徵兵制、不足以剷招募之流毒、節國家財源、而厚偉大之國力、此與内政有關、必須地方自治實現、户口登記、設有專員非倉猝可以舉辦、然自治爲内政之基礎、徵兵乃國防之必要、如執政者、能擇賢任能、亦咄嗟可辦、以國民程度衡之、自治宜採干涉保育政策、非極端自由政策、與乎牆壁標語政策、所能實現也、軍實之重大者、如海時軍艦、海防要塞、改良兵工廠等、非經長久之時間、重大之財力莫辦、平時旣未籌備、臨事而議、徒託空言、故不贅、（却酬）</p>

<h3>顚倒的邏輯</h3>
<p>不庭齋談除草夫蒼</p>
<p>中國的國事是弄顚倒了。這國事的顚倒是由於邏輯之顚倒。</p>
<p>蔣君介石說：</p>
<p>「攘外必先安内。」</p>
<p>孫君哲生說：</p>
<p>「救國必先救黨。」</p>
<p>我的見解恰恰與蔣孫二君相反：</p>
<p>「安内必先禦外；</p>
<p>救黨必先救國。」</p>
<p>蔣孫二君看見這種說法，也或者要說我是把眞理弄顚倒了。這個我也不必强辯讓事實自己去證明吧。</p>
<h3>悼朱瑣語</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>歸安朱古微侍御。一代詞宗。書法融合顏柳。世所景仰。自辛亥淸帝遜位後。更名孝臧。題詞揮毫。則署彊邨漚君等别號。而於祖謀原名。屏除不用。居東有恒路德裕里甚久。與曾農髯王病山王雪澄諸老友比隣。敲句譚藝無虚夕。農髯雪澄逝世後。落落寡歡。居恒好打麻雀遣娛。年來時多不適。猶不廢吟咏與臨池。前數月因就醫藥之便。移居牯嶺路。痢疾時發。不意纒綿數月。藥石無靈。竟於上月三十日長辭賓朋。撒手人天。海内同文。莫不哀悼。憶其任廣東某科主考時。與兩廣總督岑春煊有微嫌。朱發試題時。對岑頗多諷剌。如「方寸之本可使高於岑樓」「春之爲言蠢也」。「焉得萱草」等。岑當時在粤。喧赫一時。而對朱之崛倔。亦無可如何也。余前月往粤。晤汪憬吾丈（精衛之兄）於豪賢街。殷殷以朱丈近况爲詢。並囑爲申候。豈知余返申之日。値朱丈歸道山之時。有負重託。抱歉何似。泚筆至此。重用慨然。</p>
<h3>國難新年話玩具</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>無花之花園。不成其爲花園。家庭無兒童。亦難乎其爲家庭。信夫兒童乃慰人的甜蜜的充滿宇宙間一切希望之名詞也。危邦弱國如我。期望兒童愈切。蓋殘忍之敵人爲我遺留者僅一抵抗之路。與賊總算賬。即今日之兒童也。吾國舊習。父母之視兒童。不屬玩物。即等奴婢。所謂愛之適以害之。所謂敎兒。實妨碍其發育。此種損失。任何代價不能贖回。因擬是稿。告爲人父母者。於兒童基本生活。加以注意。</p>
<p>童時基本生活。厥爲睡眠。飲食。游戲。有時夢中游戲。鹪餐游戲。游戲殆支配其全生活焉。游戲者係一種自然興味之活動。可分三類。一爲娛樂。（Ａｍｕｓｅｍｅｅｎｔ）出諸被動。以圖畫故事怡情悅性。二爲競藝。（Ｇａｍｅ）具戲劇之想像。定有目的。如棋子猜謎等。三爲運動。（Ｓｐｏｒｔｓ）多係户外身體上之競爭。游泳賽船。是玩具之運用。多在娱樂競藝二項。</p>
<p>玩具爲兒童游戲之工具。藉是多方刺戟。進行其想像世界之活動。模仿成人之行爲。玩具雖小。關係個人民族至鉅且深。蓋兒童係國家未來之主人。玩具所發之暗示。深印於兒童之神經系。不可磨滅。苟其暗示健全活潑。其敎育之價値。未可限量。倘卑劣汚俗。則遺害無窮。際茲新歲。家家户户購買玩具。幸勿視其僅供兒童頑笑。以卜歡心。要知其含科學性質。發展兒童視。聽·嗅·味·觸·體動·内官諸覺機能。引起智·德·體·羣·美·五育生長工綦大。</p>
<p>選擇玩具。應着眼四種標準。曰簡單。曰堅牢。曰美觀。曰價廉。良好玩具有生命。可刺戟兒童自己動作。積木。豆囊。玩梯。皮球。洋娃娃·動物模型。兒童反覆玩要。不易生厭。且增創造力。自信自尊心。如爲洋囝囝沐浴。穿衣·飼餧·裝飾等嬉戲。利用積木起屋·造橋·製桌·建塔·築城·作兵營。沙箱學校多備。家庭殊尠。寄語國人。務必設置。俾兒童天賦力。由此遞進。平日耳聞目睹。由是表現。譬如暴日蠻行及其救國計畫。胥能一一見諸沙箱。他日爲國干城。於是基焉。</p>
<p>玩具質料宜橡皮木竹及賽璐璐等。所以易淸潔而堅牢。反之毛類·泥土·鉛鐵·薄紙·旣碍衛生。復不耐用。玩具顏色。應迎合兒童心理。兒童所喜之色厥爲大紅。次藍·綠·　·黄·白·黑。年尤小尢喜近光帶。紺端。令人鼓舞興奮。當此民族衰頽。正可激勵奮發有爲。有時兒童棄三四十金之新汽車。寗玩舊方杌。價昻之石獅子。火車等。反不若壞錶破帽。引其入勝。自然界一樹一葉一卵石一竹竿。勝於他種玩具萬萬。故玩具不必求其價貴。求其適應心理可也。不必購自舶來。自製可也。夷考吾國古代玩具。堯時「擊壤」。軒轅時「踏踘」等僉値得發揚光太。</p>
<p>年齡與玩具成反比例。年事尤長。熱心玩眞尤减。興趣最濃時期在六歲此後漸降。至十八歲一落千丈。此榖勞司惠爾（Ｃｏｏｓｗｅｌｌ）研究二千兒童之統計。但我人須知嬰兒滿月。即能搖推撫摩。八月已能敲物拉鈴。玩具易於入口。不便消毒或洗滌者。禁止供給。口笛口琴以嘴吹要者愼勿彼此借用。以免傳染疾病。深望大規模之百貨公司。聘請熟讅兒童玩具心理之專員。指導廠家。指導顧客。則造福國家民族。豈淺鮮哉。</p>
<h3>抗日文虎徵射</h3>
<p>— 運</p>
<p>當此國難之時。豈復有閒情逸致提倡娱樂。然而文虎一事。極能印人腦際引人興趣。則借此毛錐爲口誅筆伐之具。以聲討倭宼。要亦文人應有事也。下列文虎。倘荷海内同志投射。請於一星期内塡就寄至本報館西隔壁上海文虎專刋社。備有薄獎以酬。</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>嘴唇的修飾　美國支加哥眞時髦的婦女。對於裝飾上又有一種最新的花様。伊們嘴唇的顏色。都須與衣服的顏色互相調和。譬如身上穿一件酒色的衣服。那麽嘴唇一定染作深紅之色。</p>
<p>英國的女巿長　英國現有十三個城巿中。都以婦人爲巿長。首席法官法茂ＭｉｓｓＦ·Ａ·Ｆａｒｍｅｒ女士。兼任屈恩河上史都克巿ＳｔｏｋｅｏｎＴｒｅｎｔ巿長。政聲卓著。</p>
<p>名貴的蛛網　美國羅斯安奇爾ＬｏｓＡｏｇｅｌｅｓ地方一家電影公司中。攝製一部電影。内中有一幕。那主演的伶人。須從一扇絡有蜘蛛網的窗中外望。可是一時的决不能硬將蛛網絡在窗上。於是不得不派人四出訪求。末後果然找到了一扇很爲合用。便出重價向屋主商請相讓。把窗子連同蛛網拆下來。移往攝影塲去。</p>
<p>玻璃頂的汽車　美國有一位大富豪很愛飛機。更愛看飛機在天空中往來飛翔。因此最近定製一輛汽車。特以玻璃製成車頂。好使他乘車出外。也隨時有仰看飛機的可能。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（三）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第一回　絶代名倡索居懷美眷　畏鄕學子浪跡締奇緣</p>
<p>再加上伊還有玲瓏的心性。瀟灑的風格。淸瑩的光采。敏妙的談吐。卓越的精神。健全的體質。凡是世人所屬意於某一種美女子所必須有的各各不同的條件。不論是活潑或是貞靜。是英爽或是婉媚。也都在伊神態及舉止上找得出來能使屬意於伊的種種嗜尙不同的人。各個皆能獲得舒愜的滿意。又凑巧還剛在那花開正好的二八年華。從姑蘇移植到北京。兼收了北脂南黛的靈秀禀賦。更助成伊扶搖直上。得爲靑春時代中的驕子。十全十美的天仙。北京花界裏雖非絶後也足空前的穩坐第一把交椅的名妓。但是這様絶妙的好人兒。由天地人各種巧合的機緣　。好容易才產出這般的一個如嫦娥謫世般墜落到這裏倡門中來。一般有目其賞躬逢其盛的闊老和嫖客們。自問此福修來不易。那肯隨便錯過。失之交臂。自然本著那花開堪折的原則。就有一位多財善賈的大老。費了九牛二虎之力。從拍賣　標一般的人肉巿塲中咬咬牙出了一筆極大的價錢。捷足先登的將伊購買到手。似　羅珍寳古玩一様。藏到他那個保險庫般的什麽金屋裏去。這個交著一步特别好運。享有天字第一號的艷福的得標者。聽說是一個連做過幾任總長後來獨創銀行的老官僚。當時做出這様驚天動地的大事。眞不知艷羨煞多少色迷。氣悶壞若干嫖客。可是他究也得意不了幾時。只賞玩了半年多。連鋼製的保險庫。也會無故發生裂痕。收藏不住這宗活寳本來呢。一個腦滿腸肥的腐化份子。有多大的造化。不度　。不量力。單仗著有一堆爛紙般的鈔票。就把個鮮靈活跳絶代無雙的美人兒。黨著　常投機交易般弄了來已經是很過分的了。偏又還傷天害理。痴心妄想。依據什麽所有權獨占權硬要將　美人兒視同一件玩物。禁錮在他的家裏。永遠歸他一人自私自利的享用這是何等的殘忍。何等的鄙吝。難道天地間靈秀所鍾。很不易的不降生　這個最難得的美人未。是專爲供給他這様一個老么　消受的嗎　免　不顧臉子　　不怕　過只忠人容天也不容。要呌他少糊塗呢·</p>

<h3>糧食河下米價頻升</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源寥寥、本城店胃、緣早間小雪、且閘巿提增、人心看好、新鮮厚薄粳更覺活動、行情喊起二角、早晚稻到頭零星、寗胃略有、巿價又昂近角、洋杜尖隨到隨銷、形勢續挺變、陰元到頭不接、高料零交亦淡中段依然平庸、巿况暫絲原狀、</p>
<p>新閘　來源有限、本街交易比前巿爲爲旺、早晨開盤鄕胃最大、溧蘇自使價漲二角、薄稻到稀、行　亦增角外、洋增尖到接略少、去路尙　絡繹、致價亦昂起角許、杜尖受西　米影響、暫告平穩、</p>
<h3>現洋米消化尙佳</h3>
<p>客元續有北消</p>
<p>昨日洋米、木街消胃仍活、惟新有到頭、行情難升、期貨被洋行續抛、價亦平平、但因聞贛湘存米不再運出、各路客秈亦無來申、巿上祇有洋米應巿、一部分人心又有好望、結果巿居定勢、統巿開出小絞米四千包、價九元九角至五角八分、一號西貢一千包、價十元○八九角小絞三月份開出二千噸、價四兩四錢三分左右、均由本街收去、贛元續開四百五十包、爲天津烟台兩帮辦去、價十三元七角半至十二角半、因有本客去化、巿呈活潑云、</p>
<h3>標粉昨晨追證停拍</h3>
<p>午後照常開拍…交易不多</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午在開巿前、因追證關係、聞數額在二三十萬左右、當時未曾收齊、交易所當然重視、故停巿不拍迨至下午、以所收之追證、大部分已經舒齊、故照常開巿、惟買賣雙方、在此環境之下、交易不多、初盤較前日微呈軟象、以後因抛户甚稀、巿稍轉穩、觀察前途、因日來客銷尙佳、或可暫告平定也、結果本月份不動、二月份小二厘半三·四月份不動五·六月份好五厘云、</p>
<h3>麥巿暫歸平穩</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面呈初穩繼平之象、上午因業外多頭、仍有買進、且聞津帮收去現麥一千噸、虚軟之象、遂稍振作、迨至下午開盤因買氣又寂、復呈步軟、聞賬災麥之易換現金、確將談成三船、價低至三兩三錢、如無變動、麥巿　途、當少樂觀也、結果月份較前月小二分、二三月份不動、四月份大一分五月份不動、六月份大二分云、</p>
<h3>糖巿太古糖貨缺奇漲</h3>

<h3>南北貨泉泡圓已有成交</h3>
<p>南北貨在過去休刋期中、無甚發展、如金針菜雖見活動、然售價仍無升象、線粉干略漲、其餘如紅黑棗核桃杏仁木耳湘連榨菜等貨無甚大上客、惟桂圓因行號雙方交易、沉寂已久、近日已見　　、上檔泉泡以五十四兩左右　、出批日内可望開通、比之　價計小二兩許此後當轉定勢云、</p>
<h3>五金靑鉛昨到五百噸</h3>
<p>五金交易因各號均在結束、巿情其覺冷落、　到貨方面依然頻仍、前途頗感萎靡由、查靑鉛項、昨又到五百噸、因此巿存益厚、人心更疲、標準更覺不振、刻巿祇估十四兩二錢半、苟有大批訂交其價尙可便宜二錢半、</p>

<h3>本刋的小宣言</h3>
<p>— 垢佛</p>
<p>表明本刋的旨趣</p>
<p>請讀者加以指導</p>
<p>本埠增刋，原爲本報的附屬品，丨自由談大家稱她做報屁股，增刋天然亦只在屁股之例了丨但是和讀者發生關係，雖有空閒時間的不同，其實並不兩様，</p>
<p>增刋和本報，絶對不同的地方，增刋只不談政治，不談大局，所謂「此地只可談風月，」增刋原是别有洞天，不與本報站在同一領域之内，譬如做戲，三報是唱大面戲，老生戲，增刋只是做做紡棉花，戲迷傳等丑角兒的小戲，譬如吃酒，本報是大魚，大肉，大雞，大鴨，增刋只是幾碟鹹菜醬瓜，吃吃稀飯而已，</p>
<p>增刋旣不是大菜大戲，我們採取的資料，自應以滑稽，有趣，爽口，耐人尋味爲主，故增刋與本報和讀者發生關係雖同，而增刋與本報對於讀者情感上，有嚴重和閒趣的判别，</p>
<p>國事呢？如此悲觀，慘澹，社會呢？如此混亂，黑暗，國家的事旣不談，社會的事我們應大家想法去改良，去矯正，去指導，我們不要「盲人騎瞎馬，夜半臨深池」去跟着黑暗墮落的社會走，</p>
<p>因此我們編輯增刋的旨趣，是欲</p>
<p>從社會的迷信地方，揭破牠的迷信，</p>
<p>從社會的墮落地方，揭破牠的墮落，</p>
<p>但是增刋所謂揭破的，並不是去攻訐個人的隱私，是欲攻訐社會普通的和一般的毛病，或者個人的失德，而可以代表一般的，亦只能抽象的說法來演述，未便指名攻擊，這是增刋應守的道德，</p>
<p>上海是我國文化的源泉，同時上海又爲我國萬惡的淵藪，這本是無可諱言的事實，提倡奢侈，提倡浪漫，提倡寫意；甚而至於奸淫擄掠，男盜女娼，無一不是上海社會的特產品，</p>
<p>說來如此，到底本埠增刋，不是一部「上海地方自治的講議」又不是一部「上海的指南，」天天去攻擊上海丨或不但上海丨的腐敗，黑暗，篇篇去暴露上海社會的弱點，這又是何苦呢？</p>
<p>故增刋的第二旨趣，是</p>
<p>從消極方面說來，是絶對不與黑暗，和萬惡的社會合作，必須下一總攻擊令，</p>
<p>從積極方面說來，增刋對於文學藝術科學等等，是絶對擁護，絶對提倡的</p>
<p>例如詩歌，工藝，圖畫，及社會一切善良的行動，和特别的創作，多是增刋所極願意鼓吹的，不過增刋鼓吹的方法，不是從大的遠的地方去尋覓，只從小的近的地方去尋覓，不要從乾罕無味的地方去討生活，要從快樂有趣味的地方去討生活，</p>
<p>故現在本刋假定的目錄，是</p>
<p>小論壇</p>
<p>大衆文藝</p>
<p>大衆科學</p>
<p>街頭社會學</p>
<p>東南西北</p>
<p>上海故事</p>
<p>以上所標的目錄，不過是偶然憶及而假設的，倘遇着更好的題目，或者不能以以上標題所限止的，是要隨時加以修改，或增加，原非一定不變的成法，</p>
<p>增刋的改革，因爲倉猝起願的緣故，沒有充分的準備，雖抱此小小的願望，但編輯者智識有限，須要請讀者諸君大家來帮忙，指導·所謂［尼姑養𡇨，衆人服侍」這是增刋的光榮，也是讀者諸君的功德，這是增刋編輯同人所馨香禱祝的·</p>

<h3>秋葉</h3>
<p>— 絲</p>
<p>風起了，</p>
<p>不知怎様一來，</p>
<p>我們就此聚成了一堆。</p>
<p>風又起了，</p>
<p>不知怎様一來，</p>
<p>我們就此散到了各處。</p>
<p>誰做着我們的主？</p>
<p>是風罷？</p>
<p>我們很恨牠丨</p>
<p>我們很謝牠。</p>
<p>我們到了你們的身邊，</p>
<p>或者你們到了我們的身邊，</p>
<p>你們要是不注意呀，儘可不注意；</p>
<p>你們要是踐踏呀，儘可踐踏；</p>
<p>你們要是拾起看看呀，那末請丨</p>
<p>都隨你們的便。</p>
<p>我們有些紅色麽？</p>
<p>你們將當作春花的嬌豓吧？</p>
<p>還是當作傷心的血涙呢？</p>
<p>我們有些黄色麽？</p>
<p>你們將當作光榮吧丨</p>
<p>還是當作憔悴呢？</p>
<p>我們還完整，</p>
<p>你們將以爲我們的前塵是圓滿麽？</p>
<p>我們已破碎，</p>
<p>你們將以爲我們的已往是缺陷麽？</p>
<p>我們顧不了許多，</p>
<p>由你們如何想罷；</p>
<p>也許是，也許不是；</p>
<p>也許都是，也許都不是。</p>
<p>我們是從各處偶然集合攏來的一堆，</p>
<p>我們還要向各處去，</p>
<p>因風便，</p>
<p>和你們結了一重因緣。</p>
<p>不論結果如何，</p>
<p>我們都覺得很快樂。</p>
<p>呀，風又在起了，</p>
<p>請你們看着我們一葉「葉地，細細地飄罷，</p>
<p>如果你們願意。</p>

<h3>科學游戲</h3>
<p>— 敬淑</p>
<p>星期日溫課旣畢，風雨如晦·鄰家的幾位小朋友，纒着我講故事解悶·我想與其信口開河說些神奇怪誕的逸事，不如因勢利導，玩些科學游戲，灌輸他們的常識。下述數則，是我搜索枯腸記憶師友所述的（當然不是我發明的）演給小朋友們看了都喊「好」茲特寫出以供讀本刋的小朋友消遣之一助罷·</p>
<p>（一）白紙顯花　向媽媽要一握洗衣鹼，用淸水溶解，在白紙上畫一蓬蘭草·次取廚房中用的醋，在蘭草中間畫幾朶花。俟紙乾後，潔白如故·又向化學敎師，要些許「尼提馬士」溶液·此時向小朋友說：「看呵！我能噴仙水令白紙上現出花草！」說畢，暗將「尼提馬士」溶液，和一口淸水，含在口中。唸唸有辭，喝聲道疾，向紙一噴，於是白璧無瑕的素紙上，頓時顯出藍色的蘭草和紅色的蘭花。</p>
<p>理由　等小朋友們笑讚旣畢，自然要對他們說明原理，免使誤信眞個符法作怪。上面戲法的原理很單簡。因爲洗衣鹼是化學上稱爲「鹼質」之一種。醋是「酸質」之一種。「尼提馬士」是鹼性酸性的「指色劑，」遇酸則紅，遇鹼則藍。所以塗有鹼醋的白紙上，噴加「尼提馬士」便會顯出藍草紅花來。</p>
<p>（二）水上燃火　取紙捲一條，在其下端暗藏「鈉」或「鉀」一小塊（鈉鉀都是金屬原素可向化學敎員索討）又以一個淺盤子略裝淸水，佈置旣畢，便對小朋友們說：「我能令紙捲在水上燃燒」於是將藏有鉀鈉之端，向水上輕輕一觸，即行提起則紙捲馬上爆響一聲，隨即燃燒矣</p>
<p>理由「鈉」與「鉀」都是與水最易化合的原素，而且令水分解，放出「輕氣」，「輕氣」最易自燃，又有空氣中之「養氣」爲助，所以「鈉」「鉀」遇水，化合所生之大熱，燃燒「輕氣」殃及紙捲</p>
<p>街頭社會學</p>
<h3>公共汽車上</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>因爲一點小事，我趁一路公共汽車去北四川路，這正是錦州陷落的那一天－。</p>
<p>車上早已坐有幾個島國男女，每一個島國男女的臉上都帶着掩不住的勝利的微笑，而每一個微笑的臉都好似一柄鋒利的刀，直刺向我底心頭，使我感到一種說不出的羞愧與悲憤。我無言，只一路默念着兩邊商店鏡框上所貼的的「打倒ＸＸ帝國主義一的標語，我想總有一天……。</p>
<p>大槪是在靶子路口罷，一個島國女人携着兩個小孩，站在停公共汽車站上準備上車，我不能斷定這是有意或是無意，司機的同胞却不煞車而一直開行。</p>
<p>立刻車上的島國男女一齊站立起來，每一個微笑的臉上都換上一種殺氣，用兇暴的眼光對着司機人口裏咭哩咕嚕，我雖說不懂得他們說些什麽，但我知道是責問司機人爲什麽不煞車。</p>
<p>在嚴重情勢之下，車終於倒退轉來。島國的女人和小孩上車了，車上的島國男女都起立讓坐位，一種民族親愛的熱情，眞是感人欲泣。</p>
<p>我倒在一個角落裏，我掩住面，怕看見這一羣冷峭的面孔，但我耳際却明白聽得那位司機的同胞喃喃自語道：「唉，這便是ＸＸ國人和中國人的分别，他們一個女人不及趕上車便羣起責問，而我們整個東北半壁山河失陷了，大家還是鎭靜忍耐，漠不關心！」</p>

<h3>馮玉祥的妙對Ｋ</h3>
<p>穆藕初，黄任之，江問漁一月四日，在銀行公會請馮玉祥吃飯·穆氏說，今天只預備一盆湯，兩盆菜，和一盆點心，非常菲薄。在此地確爲破天荒。不過在刻苦自勵的馮先生食之，已經是破天荒了·馮氏在演說其政見以後，又謂彼在山中，早起必喝淸水二盃，走三千步，然後吃小米稀飯四碗，和以鹹菜一碟，視爲常課。因復連輟一對聯，朗誦之曰：</p>
<p>兩杯淸水三千步</p>
<p>一碟鹹菜四碗飯</p>
<p>上海故事</p>
<h3>上海故事（二）</h3>
<p>上海在未開埠之前，早已有城巿，宋朝已設上海鎭巿舶提舉司，元朝至元二十九年（即公曆一二九二年）始改爲上海縣·現在的上海縣城，即元朝所設縣城故址，這個縣城在黄浦江的西岸，正當東經一百二十一度二十九分，北緯三十一度四十一分十五秒，由縣城至黄浦江與長江會合之處，相距十二英哩，蘇州河（即吳淞江）經上海縣之東北，與黄浦江會合，這兩條河都是聯絡上海與太湖附近諸縣的交通河。</p>
<p>上海的地位，完全處於長江的淤泥所積成的冲積層的三角洲上，附近的鄕村，土地肥沃，宜於植稻種棉。</p>
<p>上海成爲巿鎭，至少有二千一百五十四年之久，考滬字的意義，有「列竹於海澨曰滬」的解釋，滬即捕魚之器，這様看來，上海原來是一個漁巿，是毫無疑義的，不過海岸伸長，上海失却了原來的漁巿的本質，發達而成一個大商埠，可是濱海較近的吳淞鎭，却取而代之，成爲一個漁巿，照這様推測下去，一千年後的吳淞鎭，决不會再是一個漁巿，也許成了一個比現在的上海更繁華更重要的商埠了，所謂「滄海桑田，世事多變」這兩句話，正可爲上海寫照。</p>
<p>又考「上海」二字的意義，遂對「下海」而言，然則元朝初年，海口必有兩灣，伸入海岸，此兩灣一名「上海」一名「下海」元初之上海縣，置於「上海」至於「下海」又在何處？現在一時不易考出，須待他日考證。</p>
<p>明世宗嘉靖三十三年（公曆一五五四年），當時有海盜倭宼登陸，刦掠浙江及沿海一帶，上海縣城原築有城墻，以防倭宼，至宣統三年，革命軍克復上海之後，將城垣拆毁，並將護城河塡平，所以現在初到上海的人，並不知上海的故城在何處。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Advance Along Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway Line to Jehol</h3>
<p>Kamura Brigade Pushes from Shangqitai Towards Yixian and Beipiao</p>
<p>League of Nations Commission of Inquiry Scheduled to Depart Geneva at End of Month</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Plan to Attack Jehol</p>
<p>Coercing He's Troops to Withdraw from Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After occupying Wanjia Tun on the 6th, Japanese troops have linked up with those inside the关 (Shanhaiguan Pass), making it unnecessary to advance further inland. Their target has shifted to Jehol. On the 7th, more than ten trainloads of Japanese troops departed from Jinzhou towards the Jinzhou-Chaoyang branch line.

<h3>South Manchuria Railway Personnel Transferred to Serve as Beining Railway Station Masters</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Detain Passenger Train in Xingcheng</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Foreign Staff Negotiate with Honjo</p>
<p>(Tianjin) All thirty-six stations, large and small, from Wanjia Tun to Huanggu Tun on the Beining Railway have had South Manchuria Railway personnel transferred to serve as station masters. The section between Jinzhou and Huanggu Tun has already had South Manchuria Railway station masters exercising authority and restoring passenger train services. This matter has been resolutely opposed by the Beining Railway's foreign staff member, S. Teele, who stated that he would rather have the railway stop running altogether than have Japanese personnel take over. Although Honjo has stated that he will not allow Japanese troops to obstruct passenger trains, in practice, the Japanese troops are creating difficulties everywhere for Teele. On the 7th, he negotiated with Honjo again in Shenyang. Honjo stated that the transfer of South Manchuria Railway personnel to serve as station masters was due to the original station masters having fled, and was a temporary measure taken for the sake of maintaining the safety of military trains. As long as all the original station masters return to their positions, the South Manchuria Railway personnel will be withdrawn. It is rumored that Honjo also proposed conditions: that passenger trains on the Beining Railway, between Qinhuangdao and Huanggu Tun, must have Japanese soldiers as guards and fly the Japanese flag. Teele stated that he would agree to this if the flags of China, Britain, and Japan were flown. He stated that guarding the trains was the responsibility of the railway police, and could not be taken over by Japanese soldiers. It is rumored that these traffic negotiations will be resolved on the 8th, but on the 7th, the Beining Railway was only selling tickets to Shanhaiguan. Six columns of empty Japanese military trains that arrived at Shanhaiguan on the afternoon of the 6th had two columns returned outside the关 (Shanhaiguan Pass) by 10 AM on the 7th (7th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) An eastbound passenger train on the Beining Railway was detained by Japanese troops in Xingcheng yesterday. Railway Bureau foreign staff member Burke has lodged a strong protest. All the railway employees remaining in Jinzhou have fled to Xingcheng. The Railway Bureau has negotiated with the Japanese side, demanding to return to Jinzhou to work (7th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Reuters has learned that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Lindley, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to question the Japanese military's detention of Beining Railway funds, which affects British interests. The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nagaoka, replied that the Japanese military had temporarily confiscated the railway funds to prevent them from being transferred to Zhang Xueliang, but since Zhang had withdrawn his troops, the railway funds could be handed over immediately. Today, the French and American ambassadors also went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but according to reliable sources, the purpose of the three ambassadors' visits was unrelated. There is currently no indication that the three countries intend to negotiate with Japan again over the Manchuria issue (7th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Major Powers to Make Serious Representations to Japan</h3>
<p>United States to Issue Important Announcement</p>
<p>Britain and France Will Support</p>
<p>New York, New York Times, Washington dispatch today states that the major powers will now use the form of individual negotiations to apply world diplomatic pressure on Japan. This negotiation will clearly state the treaty rights of the major powers in China, and declare that Manchuria is an integral part of China. It seems that the major powers are seeking to negotiate in all possible ways until a permanent solution to the Manchuria issue is obtained (7th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>(Washington) It is expected that there will be new developments in the Far Eastern situation within a few days, as reliable sources reported this morning that Secretary of State Stimson will soon issue an important statement on American policy. Currently, Stimson does not want to comment on this matter, but it is known that official documents recently received by the State Department, reporting that Japanese military actions in Manchuria have exceeded Jinzhou and directly threatened the Chinese mainland, have caused great concern in the US government. It is believed that Stimson's main concern is this point. After Stimson spoke with the British and American ambassadors yesterday, several newspapers stated that the major powers would jointly negotiate with Japan again to protect their interests in China and prevent war. This statement was likely authorized by official sources. Although no one mentioned today whether the major powers would take joint action or invoke the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 guaranteeing China's territorial integrity, it can be considered certain that Britain and France, even if they do not formally participate in the statement to be issued by the United States, will definitely provide clear support. This is evident from the words of the British and French ambassadors yesterday, as both ambassadors stated that Britain, France, and the United States have always worked together on the Manchurian difficulties. Today, Stimson mentioned the incident of Japanese soldiers in Shenyang assaulting Zhang Bailan of the US Consulate, saying that the US government considered the Japanese government's expression of apology to be equivalent to an admission of guilt. Stimson's words seemed to imply that the US government did not want to pursue the matter further (6th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>(Paris) France now has the possibility of negotiating with Japan over the Manchurian incident. Responsible parties, referring to the news from the United States about the possibility of the major powers taking joint action against Japan, stated that the possibility of the French Ambassador in Tokyo negotiating with Japan on behalf of French interests in Manchuria, China, cannot be denied. However, the scope and nature of any future actions cannot yet be determined (7th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>(Washington) The matter of Japanese soldiers in Shenyang assaulting Zhang Bailan has not yet been resolved. The Japanese Ambassador Debuchi went to the State Department this afternoon and then met with Stimson again tonight to discuss the matter. Debuchi later told people that Japan had already apologized for the Zhang Bailan incident, and that he had received a report from the US side regarding the matter. The United States seemed to be unsatisfied with the apology and wanted to seek other remedies (6th Reuters dispatch).</p>

<h3>Japanese Government's Policy for Ruling the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Expanding the Kwantung Army Headquarters</p>
<p>Preparing to Reform the Northeast Currency System</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's plan to establish a central governing body in the three eastern provinces to coordinate the activities of civil and military officials is reportedly about to be realized soon. The Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have agreed to reorganize the Kwantung Army Headquarters, adding departments for administration, industry, and transportation. These new positions will be largely filled by military personnel, and the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory of the South Manchuria Railway and the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang can also recommend personnel to fill these positions as a temporary emergency measure. Hitherto, Japanese activities in Manchuria have been carried out separately by the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, the Consul-General in Shenyang, the President of the South Manchuria Railway, and the Commander of the Kwantung Army. This time, the plan is to combine the activities of the four parties under one leader, making it easier to achieve success in their invasion of Northeast China (7th Kuomin News).</p>

<p>places in October last year to serve as advisors to the Official Bank, in order to prepare for currency reform. A plan by a powerful figure in Japan regarding this issue is as follows: 1. 70% of Manchuria's trade will be settled in gold coins, so the Manchurian currency system will be based on the gold standard. 2. The Shenyang Official Bank will issue convertible notes, with gold as the reserve. 3. All kinds of banknotes will be unified and the Yokohama Specie Bank banknotes will be abolished (7th Domei News).</p>
<h3>US Naval Maneuvers on the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Sees It as a Prelude to Future War</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Russian semi-official newspaper Izvestia published a commentary that paid special attention to the US naval maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean, viewing it as a warning from the United States to other imperialists not to infringe upon American privileges in the Pacific. Firstly, when the Pacific powers are more divided than ever before, the United States suddenly decides to concentrate its entire navy and most of its air force and army in the Pacific Ocean. These two things are definitely not coincidences. Needless to say, the location of the US naval maneuvers is the future battlefield in the event of a war between the Pacific powers. The current exercise of mock warfare can be seen as a prelude to a real war and can prove that the conflicting interests of the powers over the spoils of China are reaching a fever pitch, making ordinary diplomatic methods unsuitable for use. The Americans are showing their naval strength here to indicate that they do not want to see others loot China alone, but hope to be invited to participate in the spoils. It is expected that there will soon be reactions from the Japanese and other imperialists (7th Reuters dispatch).</p>

<h3>Chinese Representative Did Not Urge League of Nations to Convene</h3>
<p>Hu Shih-tse Listened to Briand's Advice</p>
<p>(Geneva) Responsible parties here today denied French news that the delegation, Hu Shih-tse, had requested an immediate meeting of the League of Nations Council, saying that Hu had this intention, but before leaving Paris, Briand strongly advised waiting until the third Monday to hold a formal meeting, which would have the same effect. Hu finally reluctantly agreed, but at the same time confirmed that when Hu met with the League of Nations Acting Secretary-General Avenol, he formally asked him to pay attention to the fact that the Japanese army had advanced west of Jinzhou, violating its solemn promise that its military actions would not exceed Jinzhou (7th Kuomin News).</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse reported to the League of Nations today about the Japanese army's advance along the Jinzhou-Shanhaiguan railway, and discussed with League of Nations officials the measures that the Council should take in the future.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Conduct Exercises</h3>
<p>Citizens Suffer a Scare</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Over 2,000 Japanese troops and military police stationed in Tianjin were deployed on various roads in the Japanese Concession from morning to noon on the 7th, ordering trams, cars, carriages, and rickshaws to exit the Japanese Concession, cutting off traffic, as if facing a major enemy. Pedestrians ran for cover, and the order was in great disorder. The Chinese Concession was unaware of the truth. Merchants closed their doors and schools closed. Traffic only resumed at 11:30 AM. After investigation, it was found that the Japanese troops were holding an inspection on the 8th, and the 7th was a rehearsal, but there was no prior notice, causing citizens to suffer a scare (7th Special Dispatch).</p>

<h3>Chen Youren Drafts Special Diplomatic Plan</h3>
<p>Newspaper Reporters Inquire About Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>Gan Jiai-hou Responsible for Answering Everything</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As the situation in the Northeast becomes increasingly dangerous, Foreign Minister Chen Youren has drafted a special plan to deal with the Sino-Japanese issue, which will be submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion in the coming days. It is also known that the British and American envoys, at Chen's invitation, will come to Nanjing in the coming days to negotiate (7th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Newspaper reporters went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 7th to meet with Chen Youren to inquire about diplomatic policy. Chen dispatched Vice Minister Gan Jiai-hou to be responsible for answering as follows: 1. The main points of Foreign Minister Chen's diplomacy are to eliminate the scourge of war, protect sovereignty, and achieve the goal of recovering lost territory in the shortest possible time. Regarding the policy of recovering lost territory: 1. Use diplomatic means to bring the recent invasion of China by violent Japan to the attention of representatives of various countries, and use the most powerful actions to suppress it. 2. Use passive armed resistance. 3. Awaken the masses to be the backing of diplomacy. The League of Nations Executive Council is currently scheduled to meet on the 25th, at which time considerable goals should be achieved, to live up to the expectations of the people. 2. The report in yesterday's newspaper that the diplomatic authorities had privately signed a secret agreement with Japan, allowing Japan all vested rights in China, and that the Japanese authorities will soon announce the secret agreement, is absolutely untrue. 3. Chongguang is resting in Shanghai due to illness. There is no news of him coming to Nanjing to meet with Foreign Minister Chen. Nohara Nagayoshi is an old friend of the Prime Minister and has many old friends in our country. This trip to Nanjing was originally to visit old friends, but he did not meet with Foreign Minister Chen. 4. French troops have invaded the territory of Guilin. The former Guangdong government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made a serious representation, and the French Consul in China has been responsible for responding on behalf of the French government, saying that the French government has absolutely no intention of invading China, and that its troop movements are to suppress the Communists. Please do not easily believe rumors in order to maintain diplomatic relations. It is now expected that this matter will not be a major problem. 5. Over thirty envoys and consuls have been assigned overseas, but the expenses are huge. The national treasury is stretched at this time, and there is no way to raise funds. They will not be able to depart for their posts in the near future, etc. (7th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital National Foreign Affairs Support Association, regarding the diplomatic events with Japan, sent committee members Wei Ciqi and others, more than ten people, to the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 7th to petition. Ye Chucang received them and agreed to forward the requested points to the Central Political Council to be handled by the Executive Yuan. At 11 o'clock, the representatives went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition, and Vice Minister Gan Jiai-hou responded separately, saying that diplomatic policy, according to China's current political system, is decided by the Central Political Council. The current diplomatic policy is Foreign Minister Chen's personal diplomatic policy, as seen in the statement issued some time ago, namely, to eliminate the scourge of war and protect sovereignty, etc. Gan also solemnly stated that Chen has a long and profound revolutionary history and will never sell his own history. Even if it is not for the interests of the country and the nation, he will not easily commit treasonous acts and destroy his personal political life. If the policy cannot be implemented, he will resign his position to a more capable person. As for the external rumors of signing various treaties, they are all untrue (7th Special Dispatch).</p>

Looking forward to the future, there must be no peace of mind.

<h3>Qin Zhen Arrives in Beijing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Zhen returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th, saying that when he was in Shanghai to handle private matters, he was unable to visit Mr. Wang, so he could not know the details of his illness. However, he heard that his illness was still the same as usual and had not worsened. All external rumors are just rumors. As for the affairs of the Legislative Yuan, because the date of the President's arrival in Beijing has not been decided, he will temporarily be responsible for acting as his agent to avoid delaying his duties (7th Special Dispatch).</p>

<h3>Conversation with Diplomatic Authorities</h3>
<p>A Defense Against External Attacks</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, someone wrote an article (Please See Chen Youren's Evidence of Selling Out the Country), which attacked Chen forcefully. On the evening of the 7th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement from a responsible diplomatic authority, saying that the various sections contained in the article were obviously fabricated facts and confused the public, which were done by reactionary elements who deliberately tried to overthrow the current government. The places where the facts were reversed and fabricated can be proved by the following points: 1. The article first mentions Bao Mingqian, a former Ministry of Foreign Affairs official in the Guangdong government, gave a speech at the Pacific International Relations Conference. However, Bao attended the Pacific International Relations Conference in a private capacity, neither representing the Guangdong government nor the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The opinions he expressed were entirely Bao's personal opinions. The Guangdong government dismissed him from his post and investigated him because Bao's remarks were absurd. Since then, Chen has never met him. Furthermore, there is no such thing as him being appointed as the Director of the European and American Affairs Department of the current government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Director of the European and American Affairs Department has not yet been officially appointed. This can be known with a simple investigation. 2. The article also states that Chen came to Shanghai to negotiate peace at the end of October last year and declared in the newspaper that he recognized Japan's economic privileges in South Manchuria, but not in North Manchuria. Chen declared that there was absolutely no such statement in the declaration he issued in October last year. 3. On November 13 last year, the Soviet Russian newspaper reported that the Tokyo telegram of November 11 stated Chen's note to the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou. The authority said that there was absolutely no such note. 4. The article also quoted Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara's declaration, saying that Chen's policy was to overthrow the Manchurian military government and replace it with civil officials. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Chen has always advocated democratic politics and cannot represent the government's policy with his personal opinions. What Chen represents is the policy of the National Government, and this policy is that Manchuria should be Chinese territory not only in name but also in fact. The author of the article said that Chen was willing to hand over the security and order of the three eastern provinces to the Japanese army. This is entirely a fabrication. 5. In the declaration issued by Chen on November 25 last year, there was the phrase (anti-Chinese riots in Korea), but the author of the article changed it to (the riots of Chinese people in Korea). In short, the article is nothing more than reversing and fabricating facts. There is no need to defend these words and the author of this article, but it is feared that there is another background, so the upside-down and black-and-white places will be corrected to avoid confusing the public (7th Special Dispatch).</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Urgent Task of Current Politics</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains of the Northeast have already been ceded under a thorough policy of non-resistance, and the government that loudly advocates democratic politics has been stillborn after months of difficult labor. Barely entering the world, it already shows signs of embarrassment. Speaking of politics today, one can only sigh. Speaking of saving the country today, one can only stamp one's feet.</p>
<p>Those who want to comment on the organization and system of the new government are reaching the extreme of impracticality. Those who want to discuss the economic plans of the new government can also be said to be ignorant of the times. Politics is the affair of the people, and there is no deep philosophy to discuss. Bismarck once said, "If I had great power in my hands and my achievements were obvious, I could immediately gather a group of political scholars to create a new political theory for me and spread it throughout the world." Our sages also have the teaching that "governing does not require much talk." Their insight into the essence of politics is such.</p>
<p>If we observe from the basis of political science, today's government is a de facto government under China's overall state of chaos. The talk of Party rule and democracy is fundamentally irrelevant to reality. If we speak of dictatorship, a review of the political history of various countries shows that after a major national disorder, the need for a dictator has become a historical common law. According to modern history, Soviet Russia and Italy are also governed by dictatorships. If France had not had Poincaré's long-term cabinet dictatorship, the economic recovery of France after the war would have been difficult to achieve. The "crisis of democratic politics" after the Great War has become a unanimous cry from all levels of society in various countries. Therefore, discussing politics today is entirely a matter of human effort and facts, and not just about how the political system is transformed. Simply removing the flag of Party rule and raising the banner of democracy, thinking that this will immediately lead to good governance, is not a fundamental argument. If we speak of policy, terms such as "Five-Year Plan" and "Ten-Year Plan" are by no means the urgent tasks for China, which is currently on the verge of national demise and family ruin, and with the disaster of partition imminent. Since the October Revolution in Soviet Russia in 1917, from the period of military communism to the period of the New Economic Policy, its main political affairs can be said to have been to quell internal strife and stabilize society. Only after a decade of long-term struggle did the political foundation become solid. Only then could the Five-Year Economic Plan be gradually realized. And the reality of the Five-Year Plan now corresponds to the world policy of the Third International, causing imperialists, warlords, and financial groups all over the world to first despise, then suspect, and finally be shaken uncontrollably. The urgency of Japan's occupation of our Northeast is the influence under this key point. Therefore, before politics is on track and society is stable, talking about construction policies and economic plans is not only out of touch with reality but also illogical, like climbing a tree to catch fish, building palaces in the desert, or a fool's daydream.</p>
<p>Today's political objects are the facts brought about by the confluence of natural and man-made disasters, the scene of broken rivers and mountains and shrinking borders, the tragic picture of 30 million compatriots in the Northeast becoming slaves of a fallen country, hundreds of millions of people along the Yangtze River struggling with natural disasters and dying without a place to return to, the tragedy of warlords and bureaucrats extorting and squeezing the people to death, and a world where bullies are dominant and good people have disappeared. If there is a powerful soldier who is willing to resolutely lead the country's army to advance to recover lost territories and defend to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, never giving the enemy an opportunity, he can be the only model soldier. If there is a person with a heart who is willing to resolutely enter and leave the disaster areas, save the victims, sacrifice personal interests and happiness, and disregard personal life and death, he can be called the only great statesman. Someone who can take strong measures, regardless of the evil forces of society, to ban the planting and smoking of opium throughout the country, cut off the root of internal chaos, and prolong the life of the dying nation can be of immeasurable merit. In the future, the only political achievement will be someone who can unite the country's army, concentrate all its strength and spirit on national defense and bandit suppression, so that imperialists have no opportunity to take advantage of, and so that bandits disappear from the country forever, he can be celebrated by thousands of families and be an immortal undertaking.</p>
<p>With national defense solid, bandits exterminated, disaster victims relieved, and opium eliminated, the nation will have a glimmer of hope, politics will have the hope of getting on track, and the minimum stability of society can be realized. Then we can gradually plan for the construction of livelihood and education, and then we can calmly discuss the merits and demerits of political theories. Then a truly democratic political system can gain a solid foundation. Otherwise, simply deceiving people with terms and empty talk, indulging in a life of drunken dreams all day long, only caring about the gains and losses of power and position, and the high officials and bureaucrats all harboring the mentality of "five days in the capital," only focusing on grabbing as much as possible, will only accelerate the demise of the entire nation. China will never be able to become a "modern country," and will go from a "semi-colony" to a complete colony. The Chinese nation will perish together with ancient peoples such as Egypt and Greece. Alas!</p>

<h3>India's Ruling Class Suppresses Resistance Movement</h3>
<p>All Indian Congress Leaders Imprisoned</p>
<p>Bank Propaganda Funds Confiscated</p>
<p>Bombs Found on Darjeeling Express</p>
<p>Pinares Public Riot Leads to Bloodshed</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th. The Indian government has completed the first step of a large-scale arrest of prominent leaders of the All-India Congress this morning, with approximately forty individuals apprehended, including nine women. Subsequently, the government declared the All-India Congress and its affiliated organizations in Bombay and Sindh illegal. While the situation here remains calm and businesses are closed, many merchants continue to place orders with British firms. New Delhi remains tranquil, although disturbances are anticipated within days, with Bombay expected to be the epicenter of the unrest. Sixteen individuals were detained in Kanpur today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th. Sir Sykes, the Governor of Bombay Province, issued a public notice today, stating that the new law aims to curb the All-India Congress's interference with public freedoms and obstruction of government institutions. Law-abiding citizens need not fear, and the government is exerting every effort to suppress the All-India Congress's activities while striving to protect commerce from the impact of pickets and boycotts. According to reports from Karachi, foreign fabric merchants are deeply alarmed by the boycott news, leading to a significant decline in sales. One Indian merchant suffered a nervous breakdown due to intimidation. However, only four Indian-owned foreign fabric stores in Bombay were closed today, and public sentiment is gradually stabilizing. Authorities have begun severing the All-India Congress's funding sources. Two Indian-owned banks in Bombay, holding approximately 4,000 pounds of English gold deposited in private names by the All-India Congress, have been ordered by authorities not to allow withdrawals. The Governor of Bengal invited cloth merchants from Lahore to discuss methods for dissolving the picket line. The All-India Congress and its affiliated organizations in Madras have been dissolved by authorities, and gatherings are generally prohibited. This morning in Karachi, the dictator of the Congress led five volunteers to the seaside to disrupt salt laws without attracting public attention or police interference. The All-India Congress's only victory today was at a merchants' meeting in Calcutta, where extremist members, unwilling to defy European and Muslim opposition, passed a resolution to adjourn for two days, expressing opposition to the government's restoration and oppressive policies. Yesterday's riots in Pinales, due to police firing, resulted in two deaths and a hundred injuries. The county magistrate was struck by a stone thrown by the mob, and several police officers were also injured.</p>
<p>Reuters, Allahabad, 7th. Local authorities here have also adopted Bombay's methods, conducting a large-scale arrest of All-India Congress leaders. Starting at 3:30 AM this morning, a series of searches resulted in the detention of thirty individuals within an hour, including Gandhi's secretary Taishi and Gulangla's dictator Kosari. Immediately after Kosari's arrest, another dictator succeeded him, but he too will soon be imprisoned.</p>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 7th. Indian extremists have begun their activities today. This morning, when the Darjeeling Express arrived here, five bombs with detonating cords were found in a first-class compartment.

<h3>American Naval Hegemony Ambitions</h3>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th. According to Washington naval reporters, the US government has decided to build pocket battleships to replace cruisers. It is reported that orders have been issued to actively change the design of the 10,000-ton cruisers permitted by the treaty and currently under construction, so that they can be transformed into extremely small battleships, but with greater power than the recently completed Pensacola-class and Houston-class cruisers. An important naval officer stated today that once the new cruisers are modified, they will be stronger than any cruiser in the world, except for the German Deutschland.</p>
<h3>European Reparations Conference</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Lausanne on the 18th of This Month</p>
<p>Briand Unable to Attend Due to Illness</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th. It was learned today that after the British government proposed to various countries to hold a reparations conference in Lausanne, it has now received replies from various countries approving the proposal. January 18th was originally set as the formal opening date, but whether it will be possible to open the meeting on that day, or whether it will have to be delayed by one or two days, has not yet been determined, as France may want to postpone the meeting slightly. In addition to the United Kingdom, the participants in the reparations conference will be France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Greece, Poland, Portugal, and Yugoslavia. Whether the United States will join has not yet been determined. Financial experts from Britain and France are now beginning talks, which are highly valued, as an understanding between these two countries can greatly assist the work of the conference.</p>
<p>Guomin, Paris, 7th. The rumors that French Foreign Minister Briand's illness is not minor have been indirectly confirmed today. Officials announced that Briand will not attend the Lausanne Conference and that Finance Minister Flandin will serve as the chief representative of France.

<h3>Political Instability in Spain</h3>
<p>After Repeated Clashes Between Militia and Strikers, Disturbing Rumors Spread Throughout the Country, Saying That a Coup is About to Happen</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 6th. After repeated clashes between the militia and strikers, frightening rumors have spread throughout the country, saying that a coup is about to happen. Today, many sources said that militia leader Sanjurjo is now planning to establish a dictatorship, and with the support of the military, he will seize supreme political power himself. Although Premier Azana denied that the militia had any plans to overthrow the government, public fear has not been diminished as a result. The public's antipathy towards the militia is now quite profound, especially in rural areas. Disturbances occurred in several places in Spain last night. In Arnedo, strikers clashed with the militia, resulting in the deaths of six men and women. Public anger is growing, and many believe that this turmoil is a sign that there will be a major change in the Spanish constitution.</p>
<h3>French Minister of War Dies in Paris</h3>
<p>Rumors of a Reshuffle of the Laval Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th. French Minister of War Maginot died of illness today at the age of fifty-four. Maginot joined the army at the beginning of the European War, repeatedly distinguished himself in battle, and was outstanding in talent and strategy. He soon entered the cabinet and has held important government positions seven times from the European War to the present day. It is not yet determined who will succeed him.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 7th. After the death of Minister of War Maginot, several newspapers have speculated about Briand's ability to attend various international conferences, saying that the cabinet may be reshuffled, and Premier Laval may concurrently serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. A certain member of parliament said that Laval would rather have the entire cabinet resign than reshuffle. In short, whether or not there will be a reshuffle depends on the health of Foreign Minister Briand.</p>
<h3>European Four-Nation Economic Alliance</h3>
<p>Aborted Due to German and Italian Opposition</p>

<h3>US Bank Corporation Releases Annual Silver Market Report</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - The American Handy &amp; Harman Company released its annual silver market report, expressing no sympathy for artificial efforts to raise silver prices. However, it speculated that silver prices do have reasons for gradual improvement due to economic factors: 1. World silver production has significantly decreased. 2. Sales of silver coins have decreased. 3. The Indian government will no longer sell silver as there is no need to do so. 4. There are already those purchasing silver to mint coins, indicating an increasing use of silver for coinage. 5. Silver remains popular in China and India, showing no signs of decline. The report estimates that world silver production decreased by 20% in 1931, totaling 196.1 million ounces, including 88.9 million ounces from Mexico, 31.4 million ounces from the United States, 20 million ounces from Canada, 19.7 million ounces from South America (mostly Peru), and 35.7 million ounces from other locations. In 1931, the silver sold by various governments and recovered from destroyed coins saw a decrease in supply of 12 million ounces compared to 1930. Siam's destruction of silver coins increased the silver supply by 20 million ounces, while the Mexican and Indian governments sold 4.5 million ounces and 3.1 million ounces respectively. In total, excluding silver mine production, this aspect of the supply amounted to 59.5 million ounces. Since Britain abandoned the gold standard, the Indian government no longer needs to sell silver. Previously, silver sales were almost necessary to maintain the statutory gold exchange rate of the rupee. Now, there is temporarily no need to sell silver. Last year, due to political instability and sluggish commerce in India, and low prices of exported goods, India's silver consumption was only 17.7 million ounces, a 40% decrease compared to the previous year. China, including Hong Kong, saw a 52% decrease in silver consumption last year, consuming only about 59 million ounces. The total world silver consumption in 1931 was 255.6 million ounces, distributed as follows: India 57,000,000, China 59,000,000, Germany 28,000,000, United States (arts and industry) 30,000,000, England (arts and industry) 10,000,000, Mexico (arts and industry) 1,000,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>000, United States (coinage) 2,400,000, consumption that could not be investigated, half of it exists in New York, London, India and other places 67,500,000, and the total world consumption is 255,600,000 ounces.</p>

<h3>The Fall of Jinzhou in Detail</h3>
<p>Japanese troops continue westward after occupying Jinzhou</p>
<p>Expected to extend to Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - Since the establishment of the Republic of China, no year has passed without internal warfare. However, what causes us the most pain and indignation is the complete loss of the Northeast to Japan at the beginning of this year. As a reporter residing in Tianjin, I have been in contact with people from the Northeast and witnessed the atrocities of the Japanese army. The impressions I have gained are especially profound, and contemplating them fills me with tears. I will now briefly report the details of the fall of Jinzhou to the readers. The Japanese army's desire to obtain Jinzhou, overthrow our Liaoning Provisional Government, and topple Zhang Xueliang has been brewing for more than a day. Taking advantage of the Nanjing unified government's initial organization and undetermined diplomatic policies, they used their full strength to attack us, leading the League of Nations to believe that our national foundation was unstable, reducing the impact of our appeals. Indeed, the international community's reaction after this event was not as shocked and concerned as in the previous two incidents, which is regrettable. The Japanese forces attacking Jinzhou were divided into three routes advancing simultaneously: one route departed from Shenyang along the Beining Railway, facing our army head-on; one route departed from Tongliao along the Datong branch line, attacking our army's left flank; and one route departed from Yingkou along the Yinggou branch line, attacking our army's right flank. The total number of troops was approximately 20,000. In addition, they increased naval vessels and troops in Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, intending to cut off our army's retreat and rear supply lines. They also conducted demonstrations in Tianjin, holding live-fire exercises in the Dongjuzi area to contain our military assistance to Jinzhou. Their arrangements were meticulous and comprehensive, while we had no preparations whatsoever. In comparison, the outcome was immediately decided. The Japanese army's plan to attack Jinzhou focused on the Yinggou branch line, as it could advance west to Goubangzi, then to the Daling River, and finally to Jinzhou. The other two routes were only intended to restrain our army from moving and redeploying. Therefore, after the Japanese army advanced from Yingkou and occupied Tianzhuangtai, they successively captured Dawa, Panshan, Hujiawopu, and Goubangzi, connecting with the Japanese army on the Beining Railway advancing from the front. Each time the Japanese army advanced, they first used large numbers of airplanes to randomly drop bombs in front to disturb our army's morale, followed by tanks and armored vehicles rushing forward with intense artillery fire to guide the infantry's assault. Our side only had volunteer soldiers and armored vehicles defending along the way, so how could they resist? In a few days, the entire Yinggou line was seized by the Japanese army. After Goubangzi fell, they further threatened Jinzhou. Therefore, Rong Zhen, the chief of staff of the Border Defense Commissioner's Office, immediately went to Ping from Jin to consult Zhang Xueliang on how to handle the situation. On the 29th of last month, he returned to Jin overnight and decided to order the troops stationed around Jinzhou to retreat into the Pass. Starting on the morning of the 30th, they began to cover the retreat of the frontline troops towards the rear. The 12th Brigade of Zhang Tingchu retreated to Zizhou, the 19th Brigade of Sun Dequan retreated to Changli, the 20th Brigade of Chang Jiwu retreated to Qian'an, the logistics training team retreated to Tangshan, and the 13th Artillery Regiment, the 1st Independent Engineer Battalion, and the Signals Battalion also retreated to Zizhou. The three cavalry brigades of Guo Xipeng, Zhang Shusen, and Bai Fengxiang, defending Dahu Mountain, detoured through Yixian along the Datong branch line and advanced towards Jiulongkou. The three cavalry detachments under the Police Department also retreated to Zizhou. Rong Zhen himself led the personnel of the Border Defense Commissioner's Office in two trains into the Pass on the evening of the 31st, arriving in Zizhou on the 1st. The Jinzhou provincial government officials also came along in the train, leaving only Huang Xiansheng in Jin to handle the administrative affairs of the provincial government. By the 1st of this month, the evacuation was complete. The Japanese army learned of our army's retreat and combined the forces from the front and sides to advance westward. It is said that the troops included the Domon Division and the Kamamura Brigade. On the 1st, they engaged in a fierce battle with our army's rearguard forces in the Daling River area. The coastal defense training army commanded by our 19th Brigade bore the brunt and was completely defeated. The machine gun companies of the 654th and 655th Regiments also suffered more than half of their casualties. Our 3rd Cavalry Brigade and 20th Infantry Brigade were separated by the main force of the Domon Division, unable to communicate with each other, and also suffered heavy losses. At the same time, the Japanese side also dropped over a hundred bombs on Jinzhou from airplanes. Our army was greatly pressured and retreated to Yunshan Station. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Japanese army captured Jinzhou. It is reported that the vanguard of the Japanese forces, the Murashima and Murai Brigades, first entered the city from the east gate. Our security team and volunteer soldiers, at the request of the Chamber of Commerce, also withdrew from the north gate. After the Japanese army arrived in Jinzhou, they searched everywhere for Huang Xiansheng but could not find him because Huang had already left the city. Now, after occupying Jinzhou, the Japanese army has continued to advance westward in the past two days, occupying Lianshan. It is rumored that they plan to extend to Shanhaiguan by today or tomorrow to complete their long-planned work. (January 5th)</p>
<h3>Telegram from Zhang Xueliang Before the Fall of Jinzhou Requesting Assistance</h3>
<p>Urging the National Government to Allocate a Large Batch of Ammunition and Funds</p>
<p>Must Be Delivered Within a Week</p>
<p>Otherwise, Even a Skilled Woman Cannot Cook Without Rice</p>
<p>Ping News - The Intelligence Office of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters released telegrams between Zhang Xueliang and the National Government: "The Japanese army is using the forces of two divisions and six mixed brigades in a long drive to attack Jinzhou. Deputy Zhang has repeatedly telegraphed the central government since the 25th of last month, requesting ammunition and funds, as well as requesting the dispatch of reinforcements to defend to the death. Although the central government has repeatedly instructed the relevant departments to allocate funds immediately, nothing has materialized. Here are excerpts from the exchange of telegrams: 1. Deputy Zhang's Telegram to the Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, You Yin: The Japanese army has launched a large-scale westward advance, starting on the horse day. The northern route is attacking Faku to spy on Chuanwu, which our security team and reinforcements have been vigorously resisting, suffering many casualties and being forced to withdraw from Faku. The southern route is attacking Tianzhuangtai from Yingkou. Our armored vehicles and Japanese armored vehicles are in fierce conflict. The Japanese side suddenly increased a large number of cavalry and infantry, launching a fierce attack on both sides of our armored vehicles. After our strenuous efforts and reinforcements, a fierce battle ensued, resulting in many casualties, and Tianzhuangtai was eventually occupied. Our army is still gathering at the station, trying to recover it. Although the central route along the Beining Railway has not yet actively advanced, their troops concentrated in Xinmin are estimated to be over one division, and they are expected to launch a fierce westward attack within one or two days. The number of their troops stationed in Shenyang and its affiliated areas, ready to provide support at any time, is even greater. The situation is urgent, and I have repeatedly ordered the various frontline units to be strictly on guard. However, with our troops in one corner of the Northeast, facing the full strength of a powerful neighbor, the disparity in strength is too great. No matter how much we try to boost morale, we will inevitably fail. Moreover, west of Jin County, places like Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, and Tianjin are located on the coast with open gateways. Once there is a conflict in the Jin County area, they will simultaneously use naval forces to threaten our rear and disrupt Pingjin, making it difficult for us to attend to both ends. This is confirmed by the report received yesterday that three Japanese troop transport ships have entered Tanggu, indicating that this prediction is certainly correct. We will inevitably fail to attend to both ends, and since our base in the Northeast has been completely lost, we are experiencing a severe shortage of guns, cannons, ammunition, and medicine. Any attempt to sustain ourselves will be difficult. As for funding, there is even less of a solution. Our income here is already insufficient for peacetime expenses, let alone the enormous wartime needs. The officers and soldiers here are extremely indignant at the Japanese atrocities, but at this time of freezing weather, their winter uniforms are not yet complete, and the chilling cold is heartbreaking to speak of. I hope you will consider all these difficult circumstances. I have a duty and have dedicated myself to the country, so I am not afraid of hardship. However, I dare not avoid speaking about what is beyond my ability, lest it mislead the overall situation. I beg you to understand my foolish sincerity, see the truth, and immediately order the allocation of one million yuan in cash to meet the current needs for food and pay. I also know that the central government's finances are also difficult, but I must ask for the soldiers to be fed and clothed. Please also quickly allocate 16 million rounds of ammunition of a certain caliber, 8 million rounds of another caliber, 10,000 rounds of heavy artillery shells of a certain type, 70,000 rounds of field artillery shells of a certain type, 30,000 rounds of another type of field artillery shells, 80,000 rounds of field artillery shells of a certain type, 30,000 rounds of mountain artillery shells of a certain type, 230,000 rounds of mortar shells of a certain inch, and 10,000 rifles. All ammunition and funds must be delivered within a week, and the ammunition is needed most urgently, so please allocate it within the day. If rifles are inconvenient to allocate immediately, it can be delayed slightly. At the same time, please dispatch a large number of reinforcements to strengthen our forces and aid in defense. Otherwise, even a skilled woman cannot cook without rice, and even if I exhaust my foolish sincerity, it will be of no avail. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. My frank and direct communication is not intentional. I anxiously await your orders. Zhang Xueliang, You Yin, Secret Seal. 2. The National Government's reply to Zhang, You Dian, limited to immediate arrival: To Director Zhang, Hanqing, You Yin Dian received. The government has secretly ordered the finance, military, and staff departments to quickly raise and issue funds, and has also sent them to the Special Diplomatic Committee. Special reply, National Government, You Seal. 3. Deputy Zhang's telegram to the National Government, You You Dian, Nanjing National Government Junjian, received You Dian with respect, will make every effort to defend Jin. However, the Japanese army is using the power of the entire country, while we have only the troops of one corner. They have sufficient military supplies and sophisticated equipment, and are launching a large-scale invasion by land and air. We are undernourished and lack both equipment and ammunition. We have no preparations for air defense or cold weather. The disparity in strength is too great. I hope that you will understand all these circumstances. Once the war begins, it will not be resolved overnight. As for replenishment and reinforcements, there must be concrete measures to ensure that Japan in Tianjin has now assembled a large army. Once the battle in Jin begins, the entire situation in North China will be affected at the same time. You must plan in advance for this point, otherwise, empty words of defense will be difficult to put into practice. My officers and soldiers have the determination to sacrifice themselves, but the matter concerns the entire country, and I fear that it will not help to alleviate the difficulties. Furthermore, the aftermath problems must be planned in advance. I am duty-bound to pledge my efforts and sacrifices, and I am not afraid of any difficulties in the face of this great disaster. However, I believe that this matter is of great importance and concerns the survival of the entire country. I cannot but state the facts truthfully and ask how to deal with it. I respectfully request that you coordinate the overall situation and give concrete instructions. Zhang Xueliang, You You Yin. 4. The National Government's Civil Affairs Office's reply to Zhang, Jian Dian, limited to immediate arrival, To Director Zhang, Hanqing, Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, Jian Dian received and has been forwarded to the Staff and Military Affairs Departments for review. By order, the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government, Jian Yin. 5. Deputy Zhang's urgent telegram to the Chairman of the National Government, Kan Xu Dian, very urgent, limited to immediate arrival: To the Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, Junjian, in order to defend Jin County, I requested the allocation of funds and ammunition. I then received a telegram stating that the relevant departments had been instructed to handle it separately, showing your concern for the border and your intention to protect the country and the people. However, the Japanese army has been pressing closer and closer, and Jin County is in extreme danger. Our army is determined to resist to the death, and the enemy has not yet succeeded. However, although the morale is strong, we lack both funds and ammunition. If the enemy launches a large-scale advance, even if all the soldiers in the Northeast are sacrificed, it will be difficult to defend. The matter concerns the entire country, and since you have repeatedly ordered them to fulfill their duties, you should provide practical support. The matter is urgent, and I hope that you will still look into the previous telegram and quickly order the relevant departments to allocate funds as soon as possible to meet the immediate needs. I urgently await your orders. Zhang Xueliang, Kan Yin. 6. The Civil Affairs Office of the Nanjing National Government's reply to Zhang, Yan You Dian, limited to immediate arrival: To Director Zhang, Hanqing, Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, Junjian, the matters stated in Kan Secret Dian have been properly and confidentially forwarded to the relevant departments for prompt handling. Special reply, the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government, Yan You Yin."</p>
<h3>White Russians Still Active in Harbin</h3>
<p>Has Become a Dispute Between White Russians and the Police</p>
<p>The North China Daily News, Harbin, 5th - Although the police authorities used firm measures at the end of the week to deal with the disputes between White Russians and Chinese people, order in Harbin has not been fully restored. Last night, there were many gunshots again, and rioters attacked the police, causing the police to fire in six places to suppress them. As a result, no rioters were killed or injured, but one policeman was killed and two were injured. It is now clear that this has become a problem between White Russians and the police. The Soviet Consul-General has notified the Chinese authorities that if any of the rioters arrested claim to be Soviet citizens, he hopes that they will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Hunan National Crisis Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Hunan National Crisis Relief Association held its inaugural meeting in Changsha on December 27th and issued the following declaration: "In today's world, it is unheard of for a nation not to rise up in self-defense when facing a national crisis, nor is it heard of to rely solely on diplomatic solutions when the enemy is deeply entrenched. It is especially unheard of to lack appropriate decision-making in both peace and war, and to merely delay the situation, passively accepting encroachment. The shame of Japan's occupation of our Eastern Provinces has reached this extreme. The League of Nations' assistance has already been disappointing, and the government officials are only engaging in disputes. At this time when the nation's fate hangs by a thread, if we do not strengthen our forces and urge the Party and national officials to quickly form a capable government, then preparations for war will be empty words. However, there are myriad ways to support the weak and reverse the situation, but to defend against insult and save the nation, the people must first unite. The people of Hunan have sacrificed much in the revolution. Although we dare not be the first to claim credit, we certainly do not want to lag behind in rushing to righteousness. We now follow the example of the gentlemen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in organizing the National Crisis Relief Association, focusing our efforts internally to urge the government to quickly resolve the disputes between the Party and the government, and externally to unite our will to resist the strong neighbor and reject compromises that cede our rights. Once the national crisis is over, the Association will cease its activities. We hereby encourage each other and make this declaration."</p>
<p>At the same time, a public telegram was sent to the Nanjing government as follows: "To the Executive Committee of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Chairman of the National Government, the Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Supervisory, and Examination Yuans, and all Ministers Junjian, since Japan sent troops to invade and occupy the Eastern Provinces, the whole country has been shocked. Seeking solutions through diplomacy, the League of Nations meetings have repeatedly teetered on failure. Attempting to revitalize through internal affairs, the disputes between Beijing and Guangdong are merely wasting time. The great disaster is imminent, and public sentiment is increasingly anxious. Recently, the Japanese army has further attacked Jinzhou and harassed Jin-Yu. Our country is unprepared for both peace and war. Looking back at the key figures in the Party and government, they are still mired in political struggles, suspecting each other, either recuperating at sea or retiring to their hometowns. The central government is merely undergoing changes, with no decisions being made to resist insult. The deterioration of the situation to this point is alarming. As citizens of Hunan, can we turn a blind eye to the nation entrusted to our lives and not seek relief as it falls into ruin? We believe that our country has been advocating Party rule for five years now. The people earnestly desire governance and are holding their breath to listen to political tutelage. However, the actual results achieved in recent years are quite the opposite. Internal strife is endless, and disasters are spreading, making life difficult for the people, threatening the nation itself. Now that a strong neighbor is pressing us, and we have lost three provinces in less than a month, the Party and government officials who hold important positions still do not feel the seriousness of the situation and the magnitude of their responsibilities. There is no expression of sorrow or self-blame, no spirit of sacrifice and unity. Is this what the mission of Party rule is like? If the nation is not preserved, where will the Party be attached? Those who gain the right people will prosper, and those who lose them will perish. May our Party and government officials reflect deeply on this. The only way to counter the outside is to unite the country, and the only way to stabilize the inside is through open politics. There is no shortage of enlightened people among the Party and government officials. They should abandon their past grievances, dissolve their prejudices, adopt a selfless and patriotic attitude, and treat the people with sincerity. Now that a unified government has been formed, it should take responsibility and quickly dispatch troops to rescue the Northeast and save the people from fire and water. Moreover, in the spirit of the Prime Minister's ideal of 'serving the world selflessly', it should immediately convene a national conference and formulate a constitution, so that we can stabilize the inside, repel the outside, and bring a fresh start. The people's hearts can be solidified, and the national crisis can be averted. We are alarmed and write in haste. We hope that you will consider this.

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<h3>Han Fuqu Consolidates Security in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Taking Preventive Measures Against Japanese Disruptions</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu, considering the fall of Jinzhou and the increasingly tense situation in North China, and recognizing Shandong's crucial position connecting the north and south, along with the unpredictable appearance of Japanese warships at Qingdao, Yantai, and Longkou ports, and the large number of Japanese residents in Jinan, which could easily lead to pretexts for trouble, convened a meeting on the morning of the fourth. Attending were all committee members, department heads, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, Garrison Commander Lei Taiping, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu, and others to discuss countermeasures. It was resolved that: 1) Regardless of how the situation changes, the decision is to protect the region, ensure the safety of the people, and maintain security in the province; 2) Regarding finances, if the Third Route Army's military pay cannot be issued by the central government, it will be temporarily borrowed from the central government's tax revenue within the province to maintain operations, without increasing the burden on the people. There will be no changes to personnel in various tax collection agencies; 3) Regarding education, schools had previously started winter vacation early due to student unrest. Recently, students from various schools have requested an early start to the semester, showing a commendable eagerness to study. It was decided that the semester will begin on February 1st as scheduled, without further delay. The meeting adjourned around 10 AM. At that time, Song Shiyan, the military education corps leader sent by Han Fuqu to Beiping last month, happened to return to Jinan from Beiping after meeting with Zhang. He immediately went to the provincial government to report to Han, stating that Zhang Xueliang would jointly maintain security in North China with Han, and various North China generals had arrived in Beiping to meet with Zhang. Zhang plans to send Wan Fulin to Jinan within a day or two to discuss everything and deal with the difficult situation together.</p>
<p>In recent days, Japanese residents in Qingdao have repeatedly attempted to cause trouble, with the navy repeatedly landing to demonstrate, causing anxiety among the people. Han Fuqu, recognizing Qingdao as the terminus of the railway, which is crucial to Shandong's transportation, and fearing that villains and bandits might be exploited, ordered Rong Guangxing, the brigade commander of the 87th Brigade of the 29th Division stationed in Jiaoxian, on the 30th of last month to strengthen vigilance, to prevent problems before they arise. He also ordered Dai Hongbin, commander of the railway artillery, and Zhang Tingxian, the second team leader, to take the Taishan armored vehicle and all soldiers, fully armed, and with tools such as shovels, to patrol the Jiaozhou area. He also telegraphed Qingdao Mayor and Navy Commander Shen Honglie to coordinate defense with Rong Guangxing's troops to ensure complete security. (4th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Sends Song Shiyan to Beiping</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Government, after Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, telegraphed an invitation to Han Fuqu to visit Beiping, which he was unable to accept personally, specially sent Song Shiyan, head of the Third Route Army Military Education Corps, as his representative to discuss security and financial issues in North China. He returned yesterday (the 4th) after completing his mission and reported to Han on his meeting with Zhang and Zhang's views on security in North China. Han, recently concerned about the loss of Jinzhou, the increasingly urgent diplomatic situation, and the critical importance of security in North China, urgently needs to send someone to be stationed in Beiping to facilitate contact whenever issues arise. Therefore, he dispatched Song Shiyan to Beiping again. After receiving the order, Song left Jinan for the north on the Pingpu train this afternoon (the 5th). According to Song, Chairman Han believes that with the current urgent diplomatic situation and the importance of security in North China, although Zhang Xueliang has resigned from his position as deputy commander, he must still bear the responsibility for security in North China. Shandong is a part of North China, and there must be personnel stationed in Beiping to facilitate contact whenever issues arise. Therefore, Chairman Han specially sent Shiyan as his representative to Beiping. Currently, Deputy Commander Zhang and the generals and constitutionalists in North China are extremely united. As for the issue of Shandong Province, it must follow the lead of the central government. How it will be resolved in the future, I cannot judge. (5th)</p>
<h3>Huangpi County, Hubei Province, Again in Grave Danger</h3>
<p>Fellow Provincials in Hankou Request Pacification Headquarters to Dispatch Large Forces for Urgent Suppression</p>
<p>To Secure Wuhan's Defenses and Protect the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Red bandit Kuang Jixun's troops in Hubei Province, with a total of tens of thousands from the 11th, 12th, 13th Divisions and the Independent 4th Brigade, recently captured Huang'an County. Zhao Guanying's 69th Division suffered heavy losses. The authorities have only now become aware of the rampant banditry and are mobilizing troops to suppress them vigorously. Unexpectedly, after the bandits occupied Huang'an, they gradually invaded westward, and the bandits in the northern border of Huangpi also took the opportunity to stir up trouble, putting the county seat in imminent danger. The county borders Hankou and the Pinghan Railway runs directly through it, making its strategic importance extremely important. The garrison force is considered rather weak. He Chengjun, Director of the Pacification Headquarters, and Li Mingzhong, Pacification Supervisor of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Border Area, are deeply concerned about this and have reportedly increased the number of troops sent to intercept them. The situation of Huangpi's northern border being ravaged by bandits and the danger of the county seat has been reported in detail by fellow provincials in Hankou to Director He via telegram, and they have also telegraphed Minister He of the Military and Political Department, requesting him to thoroughly suppress the bandits to save the people in distress, consolidate Wuhan's defenses, and ensure the safety of the Pinghan Railway. The original telegram reads: "The banditry in Huangpi is deepening daily, and the Red bandits have approached Wuhan. Now, for the sake of consolidating Wuhan's defenses, ensuring the safety of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, facilitating the suppression of the Red bandits in eastern Hubei, and urgently saving the lives of the people, we earnestly request the urgent dispatch of large forces to vigorously carry out suppression. The pressing situation is hereby presented in detail. Huangpi is bordered by Hankou City to the south, Luoshan, Henan to the north, the southern section of the Pinghan Road to the west, and the old nest of the Red bandits in Huang'an to the east. For years, the northern part has been ravaged by bandits, and the number of people slaughtered, houses burned, and women raped is countless. Last year, the southern part also suffered from floods. The county residents who have not died from weapons and floods are in a state of displacement, poverty, and disease. There are now over ten thousand people displaced and destitute with nowhere to turn. If they are not rescued, they will either die, flee, or surrender to the Red bandits. This is why we must urgently save the lives of the people and earnestly request the urgent dispatch of large forces for suppression. First. The Red bandits have long threatened to invade Wuhan, and it is within expectations that they will take advantage of any changes in the situation to invade. Currently, the bandit forces in Hubei are strongest in eastern Hubei and Jiangbei. Those planning to attack Wuhan will definitely use the bandits in eastern Hubei as their main force, with Huangpi as the only route of passage. Therefore, for years, the Red bandits have always taken extremely slow and meticulous measures in Huangpi, gradually Redifying the south. The local people initially resisted, then fled, and finally succumbed, truly unable to extricate themselves. Huang'an was lost again last month. In central Huangpi, Paojiawan and Tianjiawan, which could be defended, have been gradually captured by the bandits. There are no more villages or fortresses that can be defended further south. Only the county seat is not a stronghold that can stop the bandits from advancing south. If the bandits invade south of the county seat, they can invade Hankou City along the railway, the lake road, or the river road. There are no longer any dangerous passes that are easy to defend in between. Moreover, most of the residents in Wuhan City are from Huangpi, with over ten thousand normally, and over twenty thousand at this time. Their traffic is frequent. In addition to cars, ships, and pedestrians, the railway must also open a short-ticket train once a day. If the people of Huangpi are banditized, there will be no way to cut off their traffic militarily and carry out inspections and prevention. This is why we must consolidate Wuhan's defenses and earnestly request the urgent dispatch of large forces for suppression. Second. The southern section of the Pinghan Railway runs parallel to the territory of Huangpi. The stations south of Wushengguan, Guangshui, and Huayuan are not within Huangpi, but they are connected to the county. The distance is only a few dozen miles. Last year, the Red bandits who attacked the troops of Dai, Guo, Qian, Peng Brigade, and Yue in the Huayuan area used the mountains bordering Huangpi and Xiaogan as their nest. Now that the northern part of Huangpi has fallen into the bandit area, the southern section of the Pinghan Railway can be destroyed at any time. This is why we must ensure the safety of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and earnestly request the urgent dispatch of large forces for suppression. Third. Huangpi is connected to Luoshan in the north, which is the most important place for large Red bandit forces in the Hubei-Henan border area to invade south. Whether defending or suppressing the large Red bandit forces in eastern Hubei, we should start from Huangpi and advance eastward. After the Huangpi area is cleared, it can cut off the connection between the Red bandits in eastern Hubei and northern Hubei. Furthermore, it is easy to divide troops and search eastward by using the convenience of the railway stations along the Pinghan Railway to mobilize troops. This is why we must facilitate the suppression of the large Red bandit forces in eastern Hubei and earnestly request the urgent dispatch of large forces for suppression. Fourth. However, for the past three or four years, there has never been a case of using Huangpi as a base and dispatching large forces eastward from the stations along the Pinghan Road for search and suppression. During the division of jurisdictions in the 17th and 18th years, the eastern Hubei region was limited to the counties under the old Huangzhou Prefecture, and the Huangpi pacification affairs were only concurrently managed by the Wuhan Northern District Fortress Command. However, the fortress's troops could not reach far, resulting in the abandonment of areas in the northern countryside directly bordering Henan, with no one responsible for their safety, allowing the bandit forces to grow. In the past one or two years, due to frequent troop transfers, there has been little vigorous search and suppression. The bandits in the northern countryside originally had the ability to destroy the Pinghan traffic at any time, but judging from their intentions, except for the opportunity to attack military troops and seize weapons, they do not often disturb the railway, fearing that it will attract the government's attention and lead to the addition of large forces for suppression. The government has indeed seemed to neglect this point and has not paid much attention to it, resulting in the bandit forces invading southwards and approaching Wuhan, which is extremely worrying. Based on the above, we dare to make an urgent plea and earnestly request review and approval." (January 6th)</p>
<h3>Guangchang in Jiangxi Province Captured by Bandits Again</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Guangchang is located north of Shicheng and Ningdu, south of Nanfeng, connected to Yongfeng and Le'an in the west, and bordering Jianning and Taining in Fujian to the east. The area is mountainous and transportation is extremely inconvenient. It was originally one of Zhu and Mao's base areas in eastern Jiangxi. In August of last year, it was once recovered by various armies, and the general headquarters established a party and government district branch in the county seat to handle all post-war affairs. Later, after Zhu and Mao's main forces fled from Xingguo to Shicheng, Huichang, and Jianning and Ninghua in Fujian, Guangchang and Ningdu were again invaded by the Red bandits. At the beginning of December, the civil defense corps in various places in Huichang and Shicheng were successively attacked and destroyed by the bandits, and Huichang City was also captured. At that time, the Guangdong army was only lingering on the Jiangxi-Guangdong border, and the 26th Route Army and the 6th Route Army were exhausted from prolonged fighting and could only hold their respective county seats. Therefore, Zhu and Mao launched a large-scale eastern offensive. According to news from Nanfeng, Zhu and Mao's pseudo 4th and 7th armies attacked Guangchang from Shicheng. The troops stationed in the city retreated to Nanfeng and Nancheng. As a result, Guangchang County was captured by Zhu and Mao again on December 15th. Nanfeng is also quite strained and has repeatedly telegraphed the Pacification Headquarters for troops. At the same time, Ganzhou sent an urgent telegram because Xingguo and Yudu had fallen to the bandits. It is heard that the newly appointed Pacification Director Zhu Shaoliang is determined to reinvigorate the spirit and actively suppress the Red bandits, and plans to order the front-line armies to change from defense to offense, and order the units of Mao Bingwen, Sun Lianzhong, and Xu Kexiang to dare to recover the lost territory within the shortest period of time to avoid irreparable consequences.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation in Wuyuan After the Bandits Retreated</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: The Jiangxi Communist bandits led by Zhou Tang and others captured Wuyuan City on the morning of December 17th and plundered wealth. The next morning, they retreated towards Dexing. The main cadres with firearms did not stay in Dexing but fled directly to their base in Guixi. Those with spears and local communists are still hiding in the Dexing-Wuyuan border area. After receiving reports from fellow provincials in Jingde and Wuyuan, Commander Ruan stationed in Leping immediately telegraphed and ordered Brigade Commander Zhang stationed in Dexing to lead his two regiments, Wu and Wang, to encircle Wuyuan's southern Taibai from Dexing. He also sent Han Changchuan's battalion to Wuyuan for defense. Commander Ruan personally went to Taibai to direct the pursuit. The Yuehe First Ship Inspection Bureau established by the bandits in Tongbu has been destroyed, and the bandit areas in Jiaotian and Wangcun in southern Dexing have also been thoroughly suppressed to eradicate the roots. Initially, the county seat's security was precarious because no one was responsible for county affairs. The county's Chamber of Commerce, Tea Guild, and various organizations jointly formed a temporary Security and Post-Disaster Committee, electing Dong Jifu, Cheng Wenwu, and nine others as committee members to handle post-disaster affairs. Only when the Jiangxi troops arrived in the county seat on the 22nd did the people's hearts and order gradually stabilize. Several abducted hostages have not yet been released. The Good-Will Committee learned that Wang Huayin of the Qianyuan Pharmacy was forced to pay an insufficient amount by the bandit army and was taken away, and was instructed to prepare the money to redeem him. On the 19th, they collected the money and sent someone to redeem him, but upon reaching Dexing, they did not dare to proceed due to the intense pursuit by the army along the way and returned with the money. Currently, the Good-Will Committee, to ensure the safety of each hostage, has specially requested Battalion Commander Han to issue a passport and make further efforts to redeem them. The captured Catholic priest has already been issued a telegram by the Foreign Ministry of the National Government and the provincial government, ordering the local garrison and public organizations to rescue him from danger within a time limit. Moreover, in Wuyuan City's prosperous Northwest Street, from Jichang Pawnshop to Xiguan, all major shops have suffered losses. Companies such as Dinghe Oil Shop, Runchang Lisun Cloth Shop, and China-Germany Company have decided to close down due to being completely looted. Most of the others have not yet reopened. The county elementary school has also suffered too much damage and will be difficult to reopen this year. Former County Magistrate Qi Qingchi went to Jin province before the city fell and is reportedly no longer returning to his post. The provincial government has appointed Ke Kaiwen (formerly the County Magistrate of Yingshan) to take over in Wuyuan and is expected to arrive in Wuyuan within days. However, the county government offices were burned down, and the administration has lost its place. It is generally agreed to use Ziyang Academy as the government site and a selection and deployment will be made again after the new county magistrate arrives. (December 27th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Testimony of Witnesses in Tang's Murder Case: Tang Zhiqi, the owner of Tang Helong store outside the West Gate of this city, was assassinated last year. Yang Shijie, a supervising officer of the Public Security Bureau, arrested Shen Shaoqing, a habitual thief who had escaped from prison. At the prosecutor's office, Shen confessed that Tang Daguan hired two unnamed fugitives to carry out the assassination, and that he was only responsible for digging and prying open the wall. Following this, Tang Qiusheng, the son of the deceased, was suspected and summoned for questioning and prosecuted in the criminal court. On the 21st of last month, Criminal Court Judge Zhang questioned the thief Shen Shaoqing, who suddenly retracted his confession, claiming that the investigators of the Public Security Bureau had promised him a reward of 10% or 4,000 yuan, and had given him opium on the spot to teach him what to say. Now that his conscience has been awakened, he said that it has nothing to do with Tang Qiusheng. The court then issued a warrant to summon witnesses Yang Jie and others, and the court was reconvened at 9:00 AM today (the 7th) for continued questioning. The judge summoned Yang Shijie, the supervising officer of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the case, to court to question him about the case investigation. Then, Shen Shaoqing was summoned to court, and his confession was similar to the previous one, except that he changed the promised reward of forty yuan to four yuan, and added that during a certain time in the waiting room, Yang had given him one yuan, and someone wearing a red-rimmed hat had gone to exchange it for small change. The judge immediately gathered all the police officers and ordered Shen to identify them, but he was unable to do so, and said that there was another person wearing plain clothes. Yang Shijie then stated that since Shen Shaoqing's confession first mentioned someone wearing a red-rimmed hat and then changed it to someone wearing plain clothes, he asked the judge to investigate this point. Tang Qiusheng was also summoned and questioned about whether he had a good relationship with his brother Tang Jingren. Tang replied that they had a normal relationship, and the rest of his testimony was similar to his previous statement. The apprentice Ye Diankui was also questioned briefly. Tang Qiusheng's lawyer, Zhang Baopei, requested that Tang Qiusheng be released on bail. The judge ruled that the judgment in this case was imminent, and Chu will be summoned again for questioning and verification.</p>
<p>Post Office Embezzlement of Large Sums: At 2:00 AM on the 6th, the West Gate Post Office of this city heard noises. When the staff were awakened to check, they found that the door of the safe in the director's office had been pried open, and 2,000 yuan in cash was missing. They immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which sent Supervising Officer Yang Shijie to investigate. The thief climbed down from the post office's patio using a ladder and broke open the iron safe door. When the victim became aware of the situation, the thief hurriedly took the loot and escaped through the back door. Director Gu of the post office has personally requested the Public Security Bureau to investigate and has reported it to the headquarters.</p>
<p>Theft of Hairtail Fishing Boat Revealed: On the 5th, a hairtail fishing boat from the Doxing Seafood Company in Caoging North Library, along with many other fishermen, arrived. However, apart from the captain, they were all pirates monitoring the situation and forbidding anyone from speaking out. They took the fish and left without paying the price. Later, the captain informed the owner of the company, Lu Zikuang, who reported it to the 15th Precinct of the town. Police Officer Wu Zongchen immediately pursued the pirates. When they arrived at the bank of the North Library Bridge, the lookout resisted arrest and fought for about half an hour. The pirates fled far away, and only a Mauser rifle, a bayonet, and two cartridge clips were recovered. Fearing that the fishing boat parked on the beach would be hijacked by the pirates, they reported it to the water police to guard it. Currently, the captain Zhang Ruishi, Zheng Xiaosheng, and Yang Derong, along with the recovered weapons, have been brought to Songjiang. According to their confession, the total value of the boat and cargo was 540 yuan. 260 yuan had already been taken by the pirates, and the remaining amount would be paid tonight. They are all victims. Officer Wu has mailed a notice to the families of the fishermen to come and collect it.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder in West Xu Market: Wang Laosan, a native of Changyinsha, Jiangbei, who was taking care of a graveyard in Yangjiaba, West Xu Market, Phoenix District of this county, lived there with his wife and daughters. He collected 300 yuan in mutual aid funds the night before. That night, Qi San, a fellow villager, came to stay overnight. Unexpectedly, two men suddenly came with knives in the middle of the night to rob. They first tied up Wang Laosan and threw a lime bag at him, but it missed. Wang resisted the robbers and was stabbed in the throat with a sharp knife, causing him to die. When Wang's wife and daughters saw this, they got up and were also beaten. Wang's second daughter escaped through the back door and reported it to the district office, which sent the security corps. The robbers had already fled, but Wang Laosan was found lying dead on the ground. When Wang's wife was questioned, she said that the mutual aid funds had been completely robbed, and that she had reported the matter of someone staying overnight the night before. The corps police went to the Qi family pier to search Qi's house, but Qi and others denied it. They only found a felt hat with the words "Chen Kerong" on it. When asked, they only said that this person lived in Gushan. They then rushed to the pavilion under Gushan Slope and captured two men, both with bloodstains on their hands and faces. They also found a small knife seven or eight inches long beside them, with bloodstains still visible. One claimed to be Chen Kerong, and the other claimed to be Chen Laosan. They brought Qi San, Zhu A'gen, and nine others to the police station and transferred them to the county government for questioning. Chen Kerong and Chen Laosan confessed to killing Wang Laosan. The others were suspected. The county government is still investigating.</p>
<p>Suspicious Japanese Person Ordered to Leave the Country: On the 4th, a traveler suddenly came to the Dadong Hotel outside the South Gate of this county, claiming to be Japanese and accompanied by a male servant. He was extravagant and called prostitutes for pleasure all day long. The Second Precinct of the Public Security Bureau heard about this and went to investigate. The Japanese person immediately produced a business card with the words "Member of the International League Association, Koki Sei," and "Shanghai" below it. On the back, there were nine articles, including "International Labor Organization, Establishment of the Eight-Hour Work System, Prohibition of Night Work for Women, Immigration." The police deemed him suspicious and took him to the police station. The Japanese person then claimed, "I am Japanese and not subject to Chinese interference," and immediately telegraphed the Japanese consulate in Suzhou for assistance. After detailed questioning by the Party Committee, he claimed to have been born in Japan, but his parents were both overseas Chinese. He became a Japanese citizen at the age of two, returned to China at the age of fourteen, and is now fifty-five years old. He currently resides in Suzhou and came here for travel. The Public Security Bureau, considering the matter to be of great importance, transferred him to the county government on the night of the 5th. County Magistrate Yi, together with Trial Staff Member Chai and Party Committee An Weinan, opened the court for questioning. Gao confessed as before. The county determined that Gao had no criminal suspicion. The prostitution part was handed over to the Public Security Bureau for handling. As a result, the bureau sentenced him to ten days of detention, which was later changed to a fine of ten yuan. He was released on bail and ordered to leave the country.</p>
<p>Police Officer Mistakenly Injures Farmer While Shooting a Dog: The citizens of Xiaozhen, Zhizhang, Zhengxiu District of this county, were in a state of panic due to the robbery by bandits in the previous year. They specially submitted a joint request to the county government, requesting to send a police team to the town for defense. The county government ordered Qian, the captain of the county police team, to allocate more than twenty police officers to the town for defense. Fortunately, they have been living in peace. Recently, the Liu Wu family in the town had a yellow dog that was used to guard the house, but it was quite fierce and liked to steal food. On the 4th of this month, the dog went to the house of Du, the captain of the police team, to steal dishes and broke many bowls. Du was very angry and tried to chase it, but the dog had already gone far. The next day, the dog was lying on the ground and was seen by a police officer. He returned to the team headquarters, obtained a rifle, loaded it with live ammunition, and rushed to the dog's location. He aimed and fired, but the dog was startled and escaped. Seeing that he was about to miss, the police officer fired a second shot at the dog. Unexpectedly, the dog escaped, and the bullet mistakenly hit the back of a farmer named Zhou Maosong. Zhou immediately fell to the ground. When Zhou's wife saw this, she rushed to the district office to report that her husband had been shot and was about to die. When District Chief Gu heard this, he immediately ordered someone to investigate. It turned out that it was a police officer who had mistakenly shot him. On one hand, he sent the injured farmer Zhou Maosong to Jishan in the city for medical treatment. On the other hand, he reported the situation to Qian Mobin, the captain of the police team, for handling. It is unknown what Captain Qian will do.</p>
<p>Another Shuttle Bus Added to Suzhou-Changshu Route: The traffic between Suzhou and Changshu in this county originally had the Huimin China Bus and the morning and evening buses of the China Merchants Bureau. Later, the Huimin Company stopped running due to internal disputes. Now, someone has organized the Huimin Company and added the Suzhou-Changshu bus, extending the route from Gangkou Town in Changshu to Suzhou. A wharf has also been set up in the urban area of Changshu outside the West Gate. The time is at 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM. It started running on the 5th. In response, the Huimin Bus also resumed running on the 6th, with the time still being 10:00 AM to Suzhou every morning and returning to Changshu at 3:00 PM.</p>

Xu Jingqing, believing Dr. Yu was negligent, apprehended Dr. Yu and brought him to the police precinct, who then transferred him to the District Procuratorate. He was released on bail after paying a 500 yuan cash deposit, pending investigation. Meanwhile, Western doctor Hui was invited to examine the cause of death.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Military Department Orders Investigation into Wei Dacheng's Inspection of British Ship: Wei Dacheng, the former chief inspector of the fortress, along with Han Bangzun, Hu Yimin, Hu Peize, and others, attempted to inspect the Tai Gu Company's Wuhu ship at the port on December 25th of last year. They were detained by a British warship and handed over to the provincial government for handling. The provincial government has already sent a letter to the Ministry of Military Affairs to handle the case. The military department sent a section member to Cheng to investigate the fortress headquarters and inquire about everything in detail, returning to Beijing at the end of the year. Commander Yang also personally went to Beijing a few days ago to report the details to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Since Wei Dacheng was only an inspector in the Joint Defense Sheng in the spring and had already been dismissed, the Ministry of Military Affairs is still thoroughly investigating whether he impersonated an official.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Relief Wheat Transported and Distributed to Disaster Areas: The National Government Flood Relief Commission allocated a large amount of relief wheat to the disaster-stricken areas east of Jiangbei.

He announced that Lin Duan would be transferred to Secretary, He Jingyu would be Superintendent and Acting Secretary, Lu Dianyang would be the head of the First Section, Zhang Rentian would be the head of the Third Section, and Li Zhenxia would be the head of the Fourth Section. He also immediately assigned personnel to receive the handover. At around 11:00 AM, he summoned all the department staff for a speech, saying that he had been away from Zhejiang for a year. This time, he was ordered to return to Zhejiang to manage education. Due to the recurrence of his old heart condition recently, he repeatedly requested to resign, but his request was not granted, so he had to temporarily take on the responsibility. Director Zhang had spared no effort in planning and reorganizing education in the province over the past year. His loyalty and responsible spirit are admired by the entire province. The achievements of the Education Department in the past year are a great improvement compared to when he himself was in Zhejiang. This is due to the appropriate guidance of Director Zhang, as well as the joint efforts of all colleagues. At a time when the national crisis is deepening, saving the nation and wiping out humiliation, education is particularly important. He sincerely hopes that all colleagues will continue to work hard and assist him so as not to fail. This is the fortune of education in the province. All plans will be implemented as originally scheduled and can still be discussed at any time. It is heard that the department secretary, Qian Jia, and section chief, Luo Di, will continue to hold their positions, and superintendents such as Feng Keshu will also remain in their positions without much change. Furthermore, according to a certain staff member of the department, Director Chen was originally scheduled to arrive in Hangzhou on the 5th, but recently his health has not fully recovered, and he feels cold all over in the afternoon every day. Although he has made an effort to arrive at the department despite his illness, he still needs to rest from time to time.</p>
<h3>A Record of Zhou Fohai Assuming Office as Director of the Jiangsu Education Department</h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, the new director of the Jiangsu Education Department, was originally scheduled to arrive in Zhenjiang before the New Year, but it was postponed due to circumstances. It is now heard that Zhou arrived in Zhenjiang at 11:35 AM on the 3rd, taking the 10:00 AM train from Nanjing. Since this day was a Sunday and Zhou was also feeling unwell, he went to Hongren Hospital to rest. On the morning of the 6th, he went to the Education Department at 10:00 AM to take over his duties. He then went to the provincial government to meet with Chairman Gu. He left after a brief conversation. It is heard that Zhou is scheduled to take an oath of office soon. He did not bring many staff members with him this time. Except for slight changes in the Secretary Section Chief, there are no major changes in the rest of the staff.

<h3>Vice Minister Qian of the Ministry of Education Submits His Resignation Again</h3>
<p>Qian Changzhao, the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to resign after the closing of the plenary session of the Central Committee, but it has not been approved. Because Minister Li resigned and left the ministry, and Political Vice Minister Chen Bulei went to Zhejiang to take up his new position, and Minister Zhu has not yet taken over his duties, no one is in charge of the ministry, so he continues to go to the ministry to work as usual. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan's State Council decided to appoint Duan Xipeng as the Political Vice Minister, who will act as the minister before Minister Zhu takes office. Vice Minister Qian believes that someone is responsible for the ministry's affairs and has submitted another request to the Executive Yuan to resign from his current position so that he can be relieved of his responsibilities as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The University Faculty and Staff Association Will Convene a Representative Meeting</h3>
<p>A Tea Party Will Be Held at the YMCA at 4:00 PM Today</p>
<p>To Discuss All Matters Related to the Conclusion of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Association is scheduled to hold a tea party in the Western Restaurant on the 9th floor of the YMCA in Baixianqiao at 4:00 PM today (the 8th) to conclude all preparatory matters and discuss the date, method, and procedure for convening the Representative Assembly. There will be important proposals at that time. It is also heard that representatives from various well-known national and private universities in Shanghai have been produced one after another, and the registration has been very enthusiastic in recent days. However, the person in charge of the association solemnly declared to the outside world that the association is a purely free and moral combination with no compulsory nature. Those who have not completed the membership procedures have no obligation to pay membership fees. The school representatives do not necessarily represent the entire university. The original intention is to represent the faculty and staff who voluntarily join the association. For example, the Chinese representatives attending the Pacific Society do not represent the entire Chinese people, but are produced by the Chinese branch of the association. Non-branch members of the Chinese should respect the personality and will of others and not be jealous or slanderous. The total number of members of the association has now reached more than 865.</p>

The bad news has broken our hearts. From now on, hundreds of thousands of square miles of beautiful rivers and mountains outside Shanhaiguan will never be ours, and millions of people will have to lower their heads and submit to the tyranny of foreign races and the taste of being slaves to a lost nation. Seeing the fragmentation of the rivers and mountains and lamenting the daily failures of national affairs, how can we, the youth who possess both reason and passion, sit back and watch the mountains and rivers of our motherland be plunged into foreign lands without concern? Therefore, this time we are holding the supreme determination and unprecedented courage to represent the hundreds of thousands of middle school students in Shanghai in this third trip to Beijing. On the one hand, we will urge the government, which intends to muddle through internally and is helpless and numb to the outside world, to immediately send troops to recover the lost land. On the other hand, we will plan for the nation's rise and fall, which is the responsibility of every man, and ask our hundreds of thousands of middle school classmates to take on the task of punishing Japan. Since we bear such a major mission this time, we can only uphold our spirit of courage and directness and make the most effort to fight on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of middle school students. We will not care about any sacrifices. After accepting the order, we respectfully declare the above.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Middle School Students in Hangzhou Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Revisited Wang Jingwei in Shanghai on the Way Back to Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of Middle School Students and above in Hangzhou City, in view of the fact that Jinzhou has been lost, the situation at Shanhaiguan is precarious, and almost all of the three northeastern provinces have fallen into the hands of the brutal Japanese, while the government has not yet found a solution, decided to go to Beijing again to petition after a general meeting. Due to various difficulties, it was decided that each school would send representatives to form a delegation to petition in Beijing. More than 20 schools participated, with 47 representatives. The remaining students remained in Hangzhou to carry out anti-Japanese work such as expanding propaganda and inspecting Japanese goods. The petitioning representatives, led by the presidium Sun Yunpei, Bian Mou, Chen Jiaxing, Chen Daren, and Xu Guojia, passed through Shanghai on a fast train at 8:00 AM yesterday to go to Beijing. Due to the limited time, they did not get off the train. It is heard that when they return to Hangzhou through Shanghai after the petition, they will visit Wang Jingwei to make a statement.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Perseverance and Striving for the YMCA Championship</h3>
<p>| Perseverance Lost in the Last Three Minutes |</p>
<p>The Result Was 44 to 38</p>
<p>YMCA overcame their strong opponent Perseverance in an unpredictable state last night in the last three minutes. Although they had suffered a setback before, they still had hope for the Western Youth Basketball Championship. In Group B, YMCA Middle School defeated Evening Star 27-24.</p>
<h3>Cheng Jingxing Settles the World</h3>
<p>In the unpredictable ball battle, when there were three minutes left, Gu Guangdao scored a goal from afar, and Perseverance took the lead by one point, with its momentum gaining, and it seemed that victory was at hand. However, he repeatedly threw from afar, seeking victory too much, and only saw that he wasted the opportunity in vain. Cheng Jingxing of Cheng Jingxing, holding a halberd and riding a horse, waited for an opportunity and held a ball in his hand, which was successful. YMCA was more than one point ahead, and the military spirit was greatly enhanced. Chen Xianglong and Wu Youliang worked together, scoring three goals in a row, and the victory was decided. Lin Zequn's penalty of one point was like icing on the cake.</p>
<h3>Yang Linyu Takes the Lead by One Goal</h3>
<p>In the sound of the start of the battle, Gu Guangdao stood out from the camp and opened the record for Perseverance. Yang Linyu reversed and scored a basket, leading YMCA by four to zero. Cheng Jing three arrows in the middle, Hou and Chen also helped each other, leading by ten to four in turn. Yang's two goals and Guangdao's one goal became equal again. Both sides were relaxed and focused on strategies. The differences between them depended on the fate of the throw. YMCA once led by nineteen to twelve, but before the halftime whistle, one goal by Yang Linyu allowed Perseverance to lead the first half by twenty-two to twenty-one.</p>
<h3>Perseverance Failed Due to Long Shots</h3>
<p>In the second half, Perseverance took the lead step by step, and YMCA chased closely step by step. Although the difference was small, the momentum of Perseverance's ball was smoother. Unfortunately, they wasted too much on long shots, and failure lies in this point. At that time, Perseverance once led YMCA by thirty to twenty-four, and YMCA also led by thirty-seven to thirty-four. The changes in this are countless. Until the last three minutes, they were attacked by YMCA, resulting in a failure of thirty-eight to forty-four. The referees were Shu Ming and Shao Ji.</p>

<h3>YMCA Football Tournament Begins</h3>
<p>The football joint competition organized by the Chinese YMCA, in the month of the 2nd, the Yuezhong and Shaoguang teams, has already begun. Yuezhong is the St. John's Middle School team, and Shaoguang is the joint team of Jinan Middle School and Minzhong School. Therefore, the two sides fought evenly and wonderfully. As a result, although Shaoguang lost, it was not due to a lack of skill, but because they were unfamiliar with the field. On the 3rd, there were four games, but because one game was postponed and one was forfeited, only four teams actually played. Nanxing vs. Lingnan became a one-sided affair. In another group, Leyang vs. Huzhu, both sides' skills were very immature, but the competition was still fierce. The results of each game for the two days are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yuezhong defeated Shaoguang　　4 to 0</p>
<p>Zhongqing defeated Beilei B　　3 to 1</p>
<p>Nanxing defeated Lingnan C　　9 to 0</p>
<p>Leyang defeated Huzhu　　3 to 0</p>

<h3>City First Industrial &amp; Commercial Football Tournament to Begin</h3>
<p>69 Teams to Compete Starting on the 9th</p>
<p>Field Rentals Suspended on Saturdays and Sundays</p>
<p>The City First Public Stadium Fourth Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Competition Committee held a meeting yesterday to review the teams and arrange the groups. A total of 69 teams were approved to join the competition, divided into six groups according to their level: People, Fitness, and National Salvation. The People group has the most teams, so it is divided into three subgroups: Industry, Commerce. Round-robin matches will be held. The Fitness group and the Strong group are next, divided into two subgroups: Industry and Commerce. The remaining groups have fewer teams and are not divided into subgroups. Therefore, the People, Fitness, and Strong groups will have champions and runners-up, while the Fitness, National Salvation groups will only have champions and no runners-up. The competition dates are Saturdays afternoons and Sundays all day, to avoid interfering with business. It is expected to last from January 9th to May 8th. Therefore, during these four months, all school and group rentals for practice or meetings on Saturday afternoons and Sundays will not be allowed, as there is only one football field. If further delayed, the weather will become too hot to complete the competition.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>New Mayor Wu Tiecheng Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Government and National Government Sent Personnel to Supervise the Oath</p>
<p>Announced the Appointments of Bureau Chiefs and Section Chiefs</p>
<p>The newly appointed Mayor of this city, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, held an oath-taking ceremony at the City Government in Fenglin Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday. Chen Bijun, sent by the Central Party Headquarters to supervise the oath, was unable to attend due to illness. Kong Xiangxi, representative of the National Government, and Chen Qun, representative of the Executive Yuan, both attended the ceremony to supervise the oath. Former Mayor Zhang also gave a speech. More than a thousand guests attended. The details of each item are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Solemn Venue The city government gate hung the Party and national flags. In the auditorium hung the portrait of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The city government road was lined with police officers from the City Public Security Bureau, stationed with strict sentries. An armed patrol team of the police brigade guarded in front of the gate. The police maintained order inside the venue, and city government staff served as greeters. The military band of the Public Security Bureau played music.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Takes the Oath The new Mayor Wu Tiecheng raised his right hand and swore, "I solemnly swear that I will abide by the will of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, obey the Party's principles, abide by the laws, be loyal and diligent in my duties. I will never waste a penny, misuse a person, nor engage in corruption or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment." This oath.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi's Speech Central oath supervisor Kong Xiangxi said briefly that Shanghai is not only China's leading commercial port but also a world-class metropolis. At this time when the country is in trouble and the national crisis is heavy, the person in charge must not only bear the heavy responsibility of local affairs but also cope with major diplomatic tasks. Among the past mayors, Mayor Zhang Yuejun has served the longest. He and his colleagues in the city government have had concrete plans for the development of industry and commerce and the progress of construction. Now there is also the construction of the city center area. Mayor Zhang has worked hard for several years, so he intends to rest temporarily and sincerely resigned to the central government. The central government then sent Mr. Wu Tiecheng to lead Shanghai. Mr. Wu has followed the late Premier Sun Yat-sen for a long time and has a deep history with the Party. He has rich experience and knowledge. His appointment as Mayor of this city is not only a blessing for the citizens but also for the Party and the country. However, the development of this city still depends on the citizens, so the cooperation between the citizens and Mayor Wu is necessary for Shanghai to be successful. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen worked hard for the revolution, and his only goal was to realize the Three Principles of the People. The most important of the Three Principles of the People is to realize democratic politics, with the people exercising political power. When the task of governance is completed in the future, it will be time for popular elections. But this matter must start with local autonomy. I hope that Shanghai will start from local autonomy and complete local autonomy. The responsibility lies with the Mayor, but it must be helped by all the citizens of Shanghai to succeed.</p>
<p>Chen Renhe's Speech Executive Yuan oath supervisor Chen Qun (Renhe) said briefly that when Mayor Wu was the head of Xiangshan County, Guangdong, he was not appointed by the governor of the province but was personally appointed by the President. This proves that the President personally handed over the task to the head of Xiangshan County. Now that he is Mayor, he will surely work hard. There are now some bureaucrats who often do things perfunctorily, and the people of the country cannot benefit. Mayor Wu will surely do things based on the people's standpoint. I hope Mayor Wu will not cooperate with a few celebrities representing Shanghai but with the truly full city.</p>
<h3>Tong Xingbai's Speech</h3>
<p>City Party representative Tong Xingbai said briefly that Mayor Wu has a close relationship with the Party, so after he takes office as Mayor of Shanghai, he will surely make the Party and government work more closely. The two most important cases resolved by the Shanghai Sixth and Seventh Representative Congresses are: (1) The construction of the city center area. The former Mayor has spent many days of effort on this and has worked hard to manage it. This cannot be completed in two or three years and requires ten or twenty years of effort to be effective. Its relationship not only leads to the development of industry and commerce but also affects politics and diplomacy. Therefore, I hope that Mayor Wu will complete it as soon as possible to comfort the people of Shanghai. (2) On the issue of local autonomy, democratic politics is based on local autonomy. Therefore, there must be a broad mass of workers, peasants, merchants, and civilians engaged in local autonomy to achieve true democratic politics. Now I only hear people talk about democratic politics and do not hear people talk about local autonomy. It is really talking about the branches and neglecting the root. Therefore, I hope that Mayor Wu will work hard on local autonomy so that it can be completed as soon as possible, so that the citizens can participate in the opportunity of popular elections.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yuejun's Speech</h3>
<p>Today is the day that Mayor Wu takes office, and it is also the day that I relinquish my responsibility. Everyone must be clear about Mayor Wu's knowledge, talent, and contributions to the Party and the country, without waiting for me to praise him. Today, I am honored to participate in the grand ceremony of his inauguration. Based on my feelings, there are about three points. The first point is to contribute to Mayor Wu. The ancients said that the policies of the old magistrate should be told to the new magistrate. This word "tell" is very meaningful. On the surface, it seems reasonable, but in fact, it is the most sincere expression of responsibility for each other. I am not talented, and I am willing to fulfill the obligation of the word "tell" by contributing my opinions. I have been in office since April of the 18th year until today, when I hand over the responsibilities, for a term of two years and more than nine months. During this term, I believe that the most noteworthy things are three things. The first is the construction of Greater Shanghai. This is the expectation of the general public, and it is also the common mentality of the central government, the national people, and even the people of China and foreign countries. Since I took office, I have spared no effort to devote all my energy to achieve this goal as soon as possible. However, to achieve this goal, we must base it on the construction of the city center area. Regarding this planning and everything that has happened, I have issued a special publication to explain it during the groundbreaking ceremony of the new city government building in the city center area last year. Now the new city government building will be completed by the end of this year. After it is completed, it can be moved. On the one hand, a custodian committee has been set up to manage the fund for the city center. This is the foundation that has been laid, and it is not difficult to progress step by step to complete the construction of Greater Shanghai. This is one. The second is the stability of Shanghai. Shanghai is the cultural center of the country and the hub of transportation between China and foreign countries. Its importance is beyond words. At this time of internal and external troubles, if we can maintain the order of Shanghai and prevent it from being disrupted, and ensure the stability of Shanghai and prevent it from being shaken, it will surely have a very good impact on the country both internally and externally. On the contrary, its impact can also be asserted. Since I took office, I have been thinking about this day and night, neglecting sleep and forgetting food, and not hesitating to complain, so that I can quickly respond to the internal and external opportunities for more than 100 days. And every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, I gather with the authorities and people from all walks of life to discuss and negotiate ways to deal with it. This is also the reason. This is two. The third is the spirit of cooperation between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the citizens. From the standpoint of the Mayor, on the one hand, he is a member of the central government, and on the other hand, he is a servant of the citizens. On the other hand, he must also work together with the local Party and government organs to fulfill his duties. However, the central government and the local Party and government organs are all on the government side, and the citizens are the masters of the Mayor. Therefore, there must be close cooperation between the master and the servant to avoid regrets. Since I took office, I have sought to accommodate the opinions of local people from all walks of life as much as possible for all matters concerning the implementation of city government and the reform of various matters, and to give them the opportunity to participate in planning, in order to harmonize and avoid estrangement. Therefore, in the past two or three years, I have received the guidance of the citizens of the whole city, which has benefited me greatly. These three things are sincerely contributed to Mayor Wu for reference. I am ashamed of my short talent and lack of adequate performance. There are many things that need to be carried out by Mayor Wu's efforts. Mayor Wu's talent is a hundred times greater than mine, and he cannot develop his grand plans to benefit the citizens of this city. The second point is to encourage the Shanghai Municipal Government and the colleagues of the various bureaus under its jurisdiction. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, it will be five years. Since the founding of the first Mayor Huang, all personnel administration has had a certain standard. I, Zhang, the former Mayor, succeeded and served as the leader of Shanghai for more than two years. I have done my best to follow the old model for various administrative matters, and most of the personnel still retain their old positions. Today, Shanghai's municipal administration has this kind of achievement, which has not been the result of the joint efforts of all the colleagues of the municipal government and various bureaus. We all serve the country and the people, and we should all follow the spirit of consistency from beginning to end, and strive hard from top to bottom. Although I am now leaving office, the spirit of mutual struggle in the past two or three years will always be unforgettable. I deeply hope that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the colleagues of the various bureaus under its jurisdiction will work together to support Mayor Wu with what they used to support me, so that the success of this city will be unlimited, the future of all colleagues will be unlimited, and Mayor Wu's knowledge and experience are very rich, and all colleagues will benefit infinitely from his leadership. Today, when I am about to leave, I would like to briefly contribute a few words as an example of the ancient people's gifts, hoping that all colleagues will work harder. The third point is to hope that the people from all walks of life in this city will be the Mayor, who should be elected by the people. The period of political tutelage is therefore a transitional measure taken by the Central Committee. However, on the one hand, it is appointed by the Central Committee, and on the other hand, it cannot be prepared for the people's election. Therefore, all municipal facilities should be cooperated by the government and the people to gradually advance to the course of the people's election. Moreover, the period from political tutelage to constitutional government is not far away and will arrive in the blink of an eye. During this shortest period, I deeply hope that the people and people from all walks of life in this city will fully prepare their work. The so-called preparatory work is to work closely with the Municipal Government. The three things that I contributed to Mayor Wu in the first point, such as the construction of Greater Shanghai, the stability of Shanghai, and the spirit of cooperation between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the citizens, cannot be achieved by the efforts of the government alone, and they cannot be achieved by the efforts of one hand and one foot. During my tenure, I have received the guidance of people from all walks of life, and the trust and support of the citizens of the whole city. Therefore, I can express the spirit of cooperation as much as possible and there is no estrangement, so that all facilities of the Municipal Government can be promoted. This time, I resigned, and I was also begged by people from all walks of life to stay. My feelings are sincere and I cannot say. However, our common goal is to complete the construction of Greater Shanghai, maintain the stability of Shanghai, and the spirit of cooperation between the government and the citizens. I deeply believe that Mayor Wu will be able to achieve this goal, so I also hope that people from all walks of life and the citizens of the whole city will trust Mayor Wu with the trust that I have from you and trust that Mayor Wu will cooperate with sincerity and there will be no limit to the bright future. Today, Mayor Wu is the Mayor appointed by the Central Committee. In the future, he may be the Mayor elected by you. If you want to achieve the goal of the Mayor's election by the people, you must strive to express the spirit of cooperation. I will pay my respects to you at the time of my departure, and I wish you infinite hope.</p>

<p>Shanghai is the center of national finance and industry and commerce, and also the hub of culture and transportation. In terms of this country, it is the largest commercial port in the country. In terms of the world, it also occupies an important position. Premier Sun Yat-sen paid great attention to the development of major ports in the East and the construction of Greater Shanghai in the Outline of National Construction. The Municipal Government has been established for five years. Through the planning of previous mayors, especially Mayor Zhang's efforts in the construction of the city center area during his more than two years in office, the planning is meticulous, well-organized, and has achieved remarkable results. With this excellent scale, I will continue to actively promote it in the future to ensure that those who have already been handled will be completed as soon as possible and those who have not yet started will be gradually organized, so that the construction plan will be promoted to realization one by one. The three points that Mayor Zhang encouraged, and the realization of local autonomy proposed by Comrade Tong, the representative of the City Party, I will sincerely accept. The essence of the new city organization law is also in the realization of local autonomy. I have long regarded it as one of the important goals of governance and will definitely strive to achieve it. I would like to earnestly and sincerely tell the leaders of the circles and the citizens of the whole city that this time I have taken office as the Mayor of Shanghai, not to be an official, but to serve the people with a spirit of sacrifice, and to build a new Shanghai City with order, rules, prosperity, and perfection, so that Shanghai can be lived and worked in peace and contentment by the citizens of the whole city, and the industry and commerce can gradually develop. However, it must be achieved through the guidance of various circles, the support of the citizens of the whole city, and the concerted efforts of the Municipal Government and the colleagues of all subordinate organs. This city has the most developed industry and commerce in the country, so labor-capital disputes are inevitable. I believe that this kind of dispute is an unavoidable stage in the progress of modern society, but if it can be reconciled fairly, it is not difficult to resolve it. However, China's economy is backward, and industrialists and merchants are still immature, and we should do our best to maintain and develop it. Moreover, China does not have big capitalists. It only relies on small property owners to make industrial and commercial attempts. If disputes arise from time to time, the impact will be very great, so we should devote ourselves to labor-capital cooperation and guide them in detail to make them friendly to each other. Then there will be hope for the development of various industries in the future. After the realization of the construction of the city center area, the administrative industry and commerce will be concentrated in one area, and the administrative orders and facilities will increase efficiency, and the industrial and commercial industries will observe each other and compete in a regulated manner. Its development and progress will be even more impressive. I will never easily change the subordinates of the Municipal Government if they work hard and achieve great results. The above statements are just a few points. In addition, such as how to reorganize the land and the urgent need to popularize education, all of which are the responsibilities that the Municipal Government should bear. I will do my best with my colleagues to create a new Shanghai with order, regulation, prosperity, and tranquility. I hope that the leaders of various circles and the citizens of the whole city will supervise and educate me from time to time, and submit written statements on the reform and development of municipal administration. I will sincerely accept it. It is a great honor to make up for the shortcomings.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Resigns from Both Standing Committee Positions by Telegram</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei sent a telegram to the Central Committee in Nanjing, saying, "The Political Conference of the Central Committee of the Nanjing Party is informed that I was previously elected as a Standing Committee member. I know that my talent is not enough to win, and I only think that when the country is in trouble, it is enough to get a little better, so I can take the road with all my strength, so I dare not resign. However, I have been serving for more than ten days, and there is no improvement. I have been stealing the name for a long time, and I feel guilty. After thinking again and again, I can only apply to be relieved of the positions of Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Political Conference, so as not to hinder office work. I hope you will agree. Wang Zhaoming Yang."</p>
<h3>Business Circles Send Urgent Telegrams Against Japan</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Asks for Quick Decision on Major Plans The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying, "The National Government of Nanjing is informed that the Japanese army has occupied Jinzhou and is approaching Shanhaiguan and invading Rehe. The outrageous riots have become more and more. At this time when the political situation is newly established and the whole country is looking forward to it, we earnestly hope that you will quickly decide on major plans, rectify the army, use force to recover the lost land, implement revolutionary diplomacy, act on your words, and act quickly. All the merchants and people of Shanghai are waiting for orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows and submits."</p>
<p>City Federation of Commerce Solemnly Expresses The Shanghai Municipal Federation of People and the Shanghai General Federation of Business Circles jointly telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan yesterday on the Sino-Japanese diplomatic compromise, specifically representing all the merchants and people of Shanghai, solemnly expressing: "Chairman Lin of the National Government of Nanjing and Dean Sun of the Executive Yuan are informed that the Western newspapers in Shanghai reported that Foreign Minister Chen has been secretly negotiating with the representatives of the Japanese, and there is also a proposal to promote ambassadors to each other. I think that the Japanese have violated the agreement to withdraw troops, and even occupied Jinzhou, and threatened Shanhaiguan, and even coveted Pingjin and Qingji. Under this situation, our country adheres to Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings and seeks an independent, free, and equal country. How should we rectify the military and act quickly to mobilize and drive the Japanese troops out of our territory and make them surrender and seek peace? However, news came that they were secretly compromising, which is tantamount to an alliance under the city, and it goes without saying that it is a negotiation that loses national sovereignty. The outspoken remarks of Bao Mingqian at the Xinghualou Restaurant in Shanghai at the banquet of the Pacific Society caused a great uproar, but he was appointed as the Director of the European and American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this way, the compromise with the Japanese is even more traceable. Therefore, we specifically solemnly express that all the results of the negotiations with the Japanese by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that lose national sovereignty will not be recognized by all the merchants and people of Shanghai. We respectfully ask Minister Chen to pay attention. We are extremely fearful of this urgent telegram. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of People and the Shanghai General Federation of Business Circles bow and submit together."</p>
<h3>Telegraph to Avoid Sino-Japanese Plans</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China telegraphed: "The National Government of Nanjing and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are informed that the Japanese have captured Jinzhou and are driving deep into the country. We have heard that their secret plan is to first intimidate them, then adopt a means of wanting to catch and letting go, and entice our government to sign a contract to hand over the rights of way and all economic rights and interests. Finally, they will use a large loan to bait us and manipulate our national government. There is even a secret plan that has already been carried out and that we have tacitly agreed to. The Association has heard about it in secret and cannot but ask. If there is no such thing, please announce it clearly and use all our strength to recover the lost land. If we fall into their tricks, the people will never recognize it. The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China bows and submits, Yu."</p>
<h3>Professors' Anti-Japanese Association of Various Universities Demands Four Items from the Government</h3>
<p>The Professors' Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of Various Universities in Shanghai telegraphed the whole country because of the Japanese military's deep penetration: "All the people of the country are informed that since the Japanese occupied Shenyang, the people of the whole country have demanded that the government resist, but the government only knows the color of the League of Nations and has not prepared its diplomacy and military affairs. It cannot fulfill its national obligations, and it has allowed the thieves to become more and more arrogant and go deeper and deeper. Now Jinzhou has fallen again. Zhang Xueliang has 300,000 troops and has abandoned his duty. How can his crime be tolerated? The current and past central authorities have been ambiguous in their attitude towards raising the maggots, and their crimes are equal. Moreover, at this critical moment of survival, the southwest and northeast have suddenly shown signs of division. Military telegrams of provincial and regional alliances have been seen in newspapers, which obviously violate the national discipline. If the central government has a government, what kind of responsibility should it bear? The so-called Party and state leaders are either hiding and watching or traveling around on the pretext. The struggle of the walls is brewing again, and it seems that each of them is harming the country for their own selfish interests. If our people do not rise up to save themselves, 400 million people will inevitably be sold as pigs. In order to save the country, the colleagues believe that we should unanimously demand that the government (1) immediately put Zhang Xueliang on trial and punish him according to law, (2) immediately transfer elite troops from various provinces to the northeast to recover the lost land, (3) clearly announce the policy towards Japan, and (4) absolutely prohibit the military from interfering in politics, so as to avoid prolonging the civil war and causing the disaster of national extinction. The urgent telegram is imminent. The Professors' Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of Various Universities in Shanghai, Yu."</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Representative Han Meets Feng</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Battle Situation in Longjiang</p>
<p>Lack of Supplies and Ammunition for Coping</p>
<p>Feng's Trip to Ningbo and Hong Kong Undecided</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Ma Zhanshan's representative, Han Liru, met with Feng Yuxiang, reporting on Ma's fierce battle in Longjiang, the current situation, and seeking Feng's strategic guidance. It is said that Ma's recent battle situation has been relatively good because he has adopted guerrilla tactics. The Japanese army is unfamiliar with the terrain and finds it extremely difficult to cope. In addition, they are currently concentrating their forces to attack Jinzhou and have no spare energy to look north. However, Ma is also extremely short of supplies and ammunition, so it is currently very difficult to achieve substantial development. Feng was extremely saddened and indignant after hearing this and had a very detailed discussion with Han regarding military strategies and the political arena. He also invited Han to lunch together.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang spoke with reporters yesterday as follows: (Question) The newspaper reported that you are going to Hong Kong to welcome Mr. Hu. When do you plan to set off? Or will you go to Fenghua to welcome Chiang again? (Answer) Not yet decided. (Question) What do you think of the idea of succeeding as Director-General of Training? (Answer) I saw Mr. Li Renchao's letter of resignation in the newspaper, recommending me. I believe that Mr. Li Renchao is the most suitable for this position, and the government should earnestly retain him.</p>
<h3>Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai Welcomes Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>The Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, at the YMCA auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge, welcomed Feng. Feng had previously asked He Qigong to decline on his behalf, but unexpectedly around 3:00 PM, Xu Shiying personally went to Feng's residence to greet him. Feng then went with Zhang Zhijiang, Xue Pianbi, and others. Those who attended included Anhui fellow villagers and the public, about a thousand people.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying's Speech: After Feng arrived at the YMCA, Xu Shiying first delivered a welcoming speech, stating, "We welcome Mr. Feng not because he is a fellow villager, but because he is a model soldier, a revolutionary statesman, and a leader of the common people. Now everyone recognizes the Three Principles of the People as the ideology for building and saving the country. Therefore, we hope that Mr. Feng will become Zheng Chenggong and Qi Jiguang in terms of the nation, Washington and Lincoln in terms of civil rights, and the Great Yu who controlled the floods and Hou Ji who taught the people to cultivate the land in terms of people's livelihood. In addition, we also hope that Mr. Feng will become Bao Zheng, who is upright in dealing with the world. Judging from Mr. Feng's history, wherever Mr. Feng goes, corruption disappears, and local tyrants hide. From this, we can know that Mr. Feng is indeed a modern savior. This is the significance of our welcome today."</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Speech: Next, Feng gave a speech, saying, "Thank you for welcoming me. I am ashamed to accept it. I have not returned to my hometown for decades. I am especially happy to have this opportunity to meet with all the elders and brothers here. Chinese people have always loved their families, hometowns, provinces, and counties. Fellow villagers, fellow county residents, and fellow provincials all treat each other like family when they meet in other places and are extremely affectionate. However, now that the national crisis is imminent and the disaster of national subjugation is close at hand, the people of the three northeastern provinces are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor and our compatriots. I sincerely accept everyone's guidance and encouragement. At the same time, I also hope that everyone will expand the concept of loving their hometown, county, and province to loving the country and the nation. There must be the existence of the nation and the country before there can be the existence of provinces, counties, and villages." Next, Xu Qian and others gave speeches, and the event ended in joy.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sailors Demand Salaries, Leading to a Shipping Strike</h3>
<p>All Twelve Ships in Shanghai Stop Sailing</p>
<p>Ningbo and Yangtze River Ships Not Operating</p>
<p>All sailors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, demanding equal treatment with the company employees and requesting the issuance of double year-end salaries, were rejected by Guo Waifeng. Yesterday, due to the failure of the petition, all sailors stopped working. The commercial ships in Shanghai have all stopped sailing, and traffic on the rivers and seas is completely blocked, the situation is very serious. The reporter conducted a thorough investigation of the before and after of this matter, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Double Salaries: At the end of December last year, when the company employees were paid double salaries, all sailors, seamen, stokers, etc., also sent an official letter to Guo Waifeng, requesting that the sailors' treatment be the same as that of the company employees and that double salaries also be given. Subsequently, Guo Waifeng replied and rejected the request, saying that the sailors' treatment was better than that of the company employees, so the request was difficult to approve. The sailors and seamen then asked Mr. Li Zhengwu to mediate and consult with Guo, but were also strictly rejected by Guo Waifeng. This matter had no result. Yesterday, the ships that had sailed out returned to Shanghai one after another, and the sailors decided to go to the company together to meet with Guo and request supplementary payments, determined to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Meeting with the General Manager: Yesterday morning at 9:00, the sailors from twelve ships, including Xin Jiangtian, Jiangtian, Jiang'an, Jianghua, Haiyan, Guangli, Guangji, Xinming, Gongping, Emei, Taishun, and Tonghua, a total of thirty or forty people, went to the company to meet with Guo Waifeng and request the issuance of double salaries. Guo had not yet arrived at the company when the sailors arrived. Li Yuncheng, the head of the shipping department, met with them on his behalf. Li ordered each ship to send a representative. Shortly after Guo arrived at the company, twelve sailor representatives met with Guo, stating that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was an institution directly under the National Government and that the treatment of its employees should be the same as that of the customs, railways, and post offices, with supplementary issuance of double salaries to show fairness. Guo told the representatives that the sailors' treatment was better than that of the company employees. The year-end double salary for the company employees was a special arrangement by the commissioner to adjust the economic situation of each person. It was difficult to issue double salaries to the sailors. If the sailors could cancel this request, they could help each other to overcome the difficult situation. If they insisted on demanding double salaries, he would have to resign and leave. There was no result, and they dispersed.</p>
<p>Group Meetings: The representatives returned to their ships and reported this to the stokers, seamen, etc., expressing their despair. From 1:00 PM, the sailors from each ship went to the steering, engine, river pilot, and other associations, while the sailors went to the Jun'an Association, etc., to convene group meetings to discuss the issue of demanding double salaries and the unpaid wages for December. The results of the various meetings were unanimously decided to take further measures. The All Sailors Petition Group of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established, representative committee members were elected, and a declaration was drafted to seek social assistance.</p>
<p>All Ships Stop Sailing: After the establishment of the Petition Group, all employees decided that, starting from today (the 7th), the twelve ships that had arrived in Shanghai, including Xin Jiangtian, Jiangtian, Jiang'an, Jianghua, Haiyan, Guangji, Guangli, Taishun, Xinming, Emei, Gongping, and Tonghua, would all stop sailing. The employees on the ships also stopped working from yesterday afternoon. The ships were all anchored at the Jinliyuan Wharf. If the double salary issue is not resolved, the ships will not sail. The ships that are scheduled to arrive tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will also be asked to join the strike.</p>
<p>Traffic Blocked: Yesterday, the ships that were scheduled to depart included the Ningbo ship Xin Jiangtian, the Yangtze River ships Jiang'an and Jianghua, the Fuzhou ship Guangli, the Wenzhou ship Guangji, and the Nanhua ship Taishun, all loading goods and passengers at the South Wharf. The passengers on the Xin Jiangtian were even more crowded. After the sailors decided to stop sailing in the afternoon, the Xin Jiangtian temporarily refunded tickets, and passengers changed to the Sanbei Ningxing ship. The goods that had been loaded onto the ship were also unloaded and reloaded onto other ships. The export goods of the other four ships were also temporarily stopped from loading, and passengers scrambled to refund tickets because there was no hope of departure. The wharf was very tense for a while, and river and sea traffic was greatly disrupted.</p>
<p>Petition Declaration: Since the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company employees have been given double salaries at the end of each year, but not the sailors. The sailors feel that the treatment is unfair, so they have repeatedly made verbal requests to the authorities, but Commissioner Zhao has shown no sincerity, delaying and undermining the requests, so they have not been successful. Commissioner Guo took over and followed the same pattern. The colleagues were negotiating with Li when Li suddenly left his post. At the time of his departure, he gave the company employees a bonus of one and a half months' salary and a bonus of about 40% of each person's salary. The sailors were in an uproar, but Li had already left his post, and the successor ignored it, so it became an unresolved issue. Because the colleagues had been repeatedly deceived by the authorities, they sent a letter to Guo Ren in November of last year, requesting equal treatment with the company employees and the issuance of double salaries based on the principles of the Kuomintang to improve the lives and safeguard the interests of workers and technicians. However, Commissioner Guo evaded the issue, and because the colleagues had no verbal evidence, they asked him to reply in writing. He agreed to reply by phone, but the date was postponed from today to tomorrow. It was not until December 28 of last year that a letter was received, but the content was completely inconsistent with the facts, and the words were sophistical. While claiming that the company was in economic difficulty, he issued double salaries to the company employees (on the 28th). The colleagues refuted it item by item, and Mr. Huanwu mediated, but Commissioner Guo still evaded the issue and postponed it from today to tomorrow, giving only lip service. The colleagues believe that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned institution, and all employees are public servants. All duties are just each person's division of labor and cooperation, so there should be no difference in treatment. Moreover, the sailors are profit-making, and the company employees are profit-sharing, but the reward of double salaries is the opposite, which is really too unfair. Therefore, they had no choice but to go to the company together today (the 7th) to petition for the issuance of double salaries. Commissioner Guo received them, and the colleagues fully expected that he would give a satisfactory reply, but the commissioner evaded the issue and gave the same reasons as in the previous letter. The colleagues' representatives refuted him on the spot, and Commissioner Guo had no words to reply after being refuted. He then threatened the colleagues with resignation, and the most important words were: "Guo is here only to support the difficult situation. If you force me too much, Guo will have to resign, and in the near future, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will close down." The colleagues believe that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned institution, and Commissioner Guo is only a representative or a public servant of the institution. The colleagues' double salaries are requested from the institution based on the principle of equality and the purpose of improving or protecting the technology of the staff, and not from Commissioner's personal request. How can the personal request be exchanged for the personal interest of the staff ? The commissioner has been responsible for his task, which is beyond category. For the colleagues, the purpose is to ask for a better treatment, so in front of the commissioner, the commission will not take away the chance of the commissioner to back down for his lack of composure, but it has to be brought into public's attention so that the commission can ask for public criticism and aid. One-sidedly, it still hopes for the commission to reflect. In fact, based on the estimation, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's capital will be nearly fifty million, and the lost is only over ten million. In addition, ship's business would less likely be on a loss, and the conclusion would be. If the fact that Commissioner Guo wants to shut down China Merchant Steam Navigation Company or not is completely another issue, every toddler would be able to realize it. Guo uses it as a means for coercing, coercing as a means for fighting to express how he treat his staff in oppression. Moreover, Commissioner Guo is not an expert of the shipping business. He is loyal, which makes him taken advantage of others. Today,Commissioner Guo seems like making people feel forced so that others have no backing down, so any losses in the Commission and those staff should be borne by Commissioner Guo.</p>
<p>Next, the staff salaries are to China Merchant Steam Navigation Company like a drop in the ocean, the Commission leaks up to at least ten times a month. Guo should exert his efforts to exert on others but not on the Commission. It is known Guo is being taken advantage by people. The Commission's goal today is salary equality. The Commission, as the position of today's staff, is reluctant to discuss since the commission only knows about one to two in the Bureau of Politics, silence would be better. As to asking for commission and facts, disclosure must be done so the public can decide.</p>
<p>Sincerely, The petition group of China Merchant Steam Navigation Company Crew One side, China merchants Steam Navigation company. July 1st Year twenty one</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Resigns as Chairman of Fujian Again</h3>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, has resigned again after being persuaded to stay. The original text is recorded below: Premier Sun of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, after reading the official gazette, I respectfully learned that the Yuan discussed and decided to retain me and approve a leave of absence of two months regarding my request to resign from the position of Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, and that Fang Shengtao, a member of the committee, would temporarily act on my behalf. I am filled with shame and gratitude. I believe that I am incompetent, and my old illness has worsened. I am currently receiving treatment and will not be effective in one or two months. At this time of national crisis and many local affairs, without a person in charge, it is impossible to govern. I still request that the committee approve Fang committee members and take place. Yang Shuzhuang bowed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Bids Farewell to the Citizens of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun issued a farewell letter to the citizens of Shanghai, saying, "Time flies, and the seasons change. Since I was ordered to come to Shanghai in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it has been two years and nine months. I have lived with the people of Shanghai, and now I am fortunate to be relieved of my burden and return to my original post. I cannot help but express my feelings of parting and offer a few words of parting advice for your consideration. Looking back on my residence in Shanghai, I have spent a total of twenty years, and since the 1911 Revolution, I have followed the people of Shanghai and the martyrs in fighting together and dedicating my blood. Although I have occasionally traveled around for national affairs, I have been familiar with the people of Shanghai and have been frank and sincere in sharing hardships for a long time. Shanghai has become my second hometown. I have been honored with Shanghai's governance and have received the unreserved support and encouragement of the people, enabling me to devote my efforts to municipal administration and promote progress. Building a nine-仞 mountain cannot be accomplished in a day, and planting trees for ten years cannot be expected to bear fruit in the morning. Shanghai has many affairs to be addressed, and it is difficult to handle them all at once. Although I have dedicated my revolutionary enthusiasm and exhausted my wisdom and ability, I have always strived to realize the early construction of a great Shanghai, but I am ashamed of my lack of talent and the difficulties of the times. In addition, I have been repeatedly ordered to travel for national affairs, and I have not been able to settle down. As a result, my talent is short, my heart is long, my ambitions are great, and my achievements are small. My duties have been neglected, and my measures have been difficult to implement as expected. Looking back on the past and examining the present, my achievements that have greatly benefited the citizens are actually few. However, the people of Shanghai have been tolerant of my shortcomings and have not held me responsible for small mistakes. When I resigned this time, they rushed to retain me, and I am even more ashamed of their kindness. I am flattered and grateful. The reason why I resolutely resigned this time is not to seek fame or to avoid difficulties and think of retreat. It is because in the past two or three years, internal and external troubles have been frequent, and since the Shenyang Incident in September, the government and the people have been shocked, and the world is in debt. Patriots are becoming more and more determined, and those who endanger the country are secretly spreading chaos. Shanghai is far and wide, and a corner concerns the overall situation. If the security is disturbed, the impact will be great. Therefore, I have been neglecting sleep and food, planning day and night, enduring humiliation and bearing burdens, and seeking appropriate responses. My heart and strength have been exhausted, and my spirit has been greatly damaged. If I were to support myself forcibly, it would lead to public and private exhaustion. Moreover, now that the whole party is harmonious and the central government is unified, the government must be repaired and invigorated. How can my tired body bear the burden of a hill? It is also appropriate to resign. Fortunately, the successor is competent. Mr. Wu Tiecheng has been newly appointed to come to Shanghai. Mr. Wu has a deep foundation in the history of the party and the country and a great reputation. The people of Shanghai should all follow his example. With his long-standing talent in coordinating national affairs, his familiarity with political affairs, his daily cultivation of scholarship, and his spirit of tempering, he will be able to handle Shanghai's political affairs with ease, and his great plans will be seen in the future. His achievements will undoubtedly be doubled compared to those of my days in office. I hope that the people of Shanghai will use the same enthusiasm as they did in supporting me to support Mr. Tiecheng, so that the construction of a great Shanghai and the completion of the city center can be expected soon. The new municipal government building has already held a groundbreaking ceremony and can be completed by the end of this year. For the sake of prudence, the Construction Fund Custody Committee of the City Center District has been established. After this, there will be no fear of depletion of construction funds, and there will be no impact from changes in the political situation. All measures can be carried out in an orderly manner. This is what I, even though I have retired as a citizen, am still very eager and happy about. What is even more important is that Shanghai is the center of national culture and the hub of domestic and foreign transportation. Everyone knows the importance of it. Since the fall of Liaoning and Jilin, the people have been excited and have cherished the ambition to save the country and the determination to go to the disaster. I deeply see the danger of destroying the house to get the child and I am even more aware of the lesson of turning over the nest to save the eggs. Therefore, I have united with the authorities and people from all walks of life to discuss sincerely and have established a meeting every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday to gather the strength and broad knowledge. So that loving the country will not be just empty talk, and defending against insults can be seen in the future. I am seeking a sound plan to avoid the covetousness of violence, and my painstaking efforts may be understood in the end. Now that Jinzhou has fallen and foreign troubles are getting deeper, if there are too many lawsuits, it will only expose weaknesses. I hope that the citizens will maintain their pure patriotism, cultivate their spirits, align their steps, adhere to durability, and never give up. Every word and every action must follow the rules and defend the border. This will prevent them from having a chance to take advantage of us and allow us to make up for our mistakes. If we occasionally indulge in emotions and slightly break the defense, the danger of being slaughtered like fish will be even greater. This is what our loved ones are sad about and what our enemies are happy about. The great disaster in the future does not require divination. I think that the patriotic and pure citizens of Shanghai will not bear to do this. The support of a wide mansion is not just a single tree, and the aspirations of the people can form a city. Although I have retired as a citizen, I am still willing to follow the people from all walks of life as a citizen and devote my efforts to the plan of repairing and saving the country. In the past, Shaokang revived in a journey, and Goujian avenged his shame and gathered for ten years. Those who have accomplished great things and accomplished great causes in ancient and modern times have never succeeded without relying on unity and hard work. I respectfully give these words to my citizens and hope that we will work together to revitalize Shanghai and save the country. Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Zhabei Placed Under Special Martial Law Last Night</h3>
<p>The garrison in Zhabei and the Public Security Bureaus of the Fourth and Fifth Districts received orders for special martial law yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM. Therefore, the battalions and companies of the First Regiment stationed there, in addition to dispatching armed soldiers to guard the strategic passes, also sent out additional patrols. The police stations in each district also worked extra shifts, armed and prepared, paying attention to pedestrians and cutting off traffic when necessary. It is said that the reason is that Japanese ronin are colluding with gangsters to disrupt the area.</p>
<h3>Zou Lu's Statement Regarding the Northeast Generals' Telegram</h3>
<p>The Northeast generals jointly sent a telegram when Jinzhou was lost, stating that they were forced to withdraw troops due to the lack of supplies and ammunition from the central government, and that the Northeast incident was due to Zou Lu's betrayal of the country and leading wolves into the house. Zou has now issued the following statement of responsibility: There is a newspaper report of a telegram from the Northeast generals, saying that I betrayed the country and led wolves into the house, etc. The Northeast generals have not signed their names. It can also be called an anonymous exposé. If Zhang Xueliang loses the three northeastern provinces, he wants to lightly push the blame for betraying the country onto others with a telegram. Even a three-year-old child will not be deceived by him. The accumulated cases amount to hundreds, causing the pretext for the Japanese invasion. Zhang Xueliang and his son concluded many secret agreements with Japan, resulting in the Northeast's diplomacy, and even to the point that the Japanese invaded Liaoning and Jilin, and they did not resist, resulting in the loss of two provinces within a few hours. Ma Zhanshan fought alone, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but they did not send reinforcements, resulting in the loss of Heilongjiang Province. Regarding the defense of Jinzhou, the central government repeatedly ordered strict resistance, but they disobeyed the order and withdrew their troops. These facts are seen by everyone. Even if they want to falsely accuse someone of betraying the country or leading wolves into the house, can they succeed? The reason why I provoked this telegram is because two months ago, I telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, saying that as the commander of the Northeast Border Defense, he lost the Northeast land and should immediately commit suicide to apologize to the people. After the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou, I telegraphed the central government to strictly punish Zhang Xueliang to maintain discipline. It should be known that my telegram to Zhang Xueliang was entirely to make Zhang Xueliang clear his responsibility and apologize to the people, to maintain the attitude of a man. The request to strictly punish Zhang Xueliang was entirely to maintain discipline and clarify right and wrong, and I have no personal grudge against Zhang Xueliang. People of the country can understand by looking at the facts before and after, so there is no need for me to defend myself.</p>

<h3>Water Fees Should Be Calculated Based on Net Rent</h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association Notifies Its Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association issued a notice to all its members yesterday regarding the method of paying water fees, stating: "Dear Sirs, We believe that the case of the British Shanghai Waterworks Company charging additional fees on top of water fees is legally unreasonable. We have repeatedly negotiated without success and have been threatened with water cuts. The Shanghai Public Concession Bureau has clarified this illegal behavior and has decided that all water fees should be calculated based on the net rent, meaning that the amount of water fee should be deducted from the net rent that includes the water fee, and the water fee should be calculated based on the resulting amount. This matter is of great interest to landlords. Please take note."</p>
<h3>Dispute over the Assessment of Rental Values for Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Renters Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, According to a letter from the Jingmei Printing Company at No. 2 Xingapore Road, our company is located at No. 2 Xingapore Road. Previously, the Public Works Department excessively overestimated the rent and collected taxes. We sent a letter to your department to argue our case based on reason. Later, Westerners from your department came to our office several times and requested that we change the rent to 130 taels per month to avoid further trouble, etc. Because your department was willing to lower the estimated rent quickly, we also sent someone to contact the general manager of your department, and we agreed to calculate the rent at a maximum of 110 taels per month. We were allowed to do so, and someone was sent to collect the donation and issued a receipt based on the monthly rent of 110 taels. Unexpectedly, on the 15th of this month (December), we received a letter from your department with a donation ticket for a monthly rent of 140 taels, instructing us to pay the remaining amount, etc. We then returned the donation ticket, stating that if you did not agree to calculate the rent at 110 taels per month, you could return the silver ticket, and we could send a letter to your department, etc. On the 22nd, your department sent another form, instructing us to sign and fill it out. Our company is a commercial legal entity, and we are busy with business every day. We originally hoped that your department would handle all public security matters in the concession. Unexpectedly, your department handles donations like a child's play, changing its mind frequently and creating unnecessary troubles. Our company is unable to bear these disturbances. In addition to returning the form to your department, we are sending a special letter to your department, requesting that you inform your department that if you agree to calculate the monthly rent at 110 taels, you can come to collect it later. If you cannot agree, our company is willing to rent the house to your department at 150 taels per month. In addition, we will not reply to any further letters from your department, etc. We previously sent a letter to your department, requesting that you investigate and handle this matter. Now, the actions of the company are inconsistent, which is not conducive to the credibility of your government and is greatly hampered. With the approval of the letter, we respectfully request that you investigate and handle the matter as soon as possible in accordance with the agreement of 110 taels of rent per month. Yours sincerely, Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department General Manager."</p>

<h3>New Vegetable Market Opens on Beijing Road</h3>
<p>The base is lower, preventing encroachment</p>
<p>The road base is raised to facilitate drainage</p>
<p>A new vegetable market, recently built by the Public Works Department, has opened east of Beijing Road and Fujian Road on January 2nd. Mr. Zhou Dengjun, Director of the Sanitation Department of the Bureau, observed that in the vegetable markets in various places, vendors arbitrarily moved their stalls, encroaching on the roads, causing extreme congestion for those buying vegetables. Also, because vegetable vendors sprinkled a lot of water, water accumulated everywhere in the market. Therefore, the newly built Beijing Road vegetable market was specially designed with the roads in the market built two or three inches higher than the stall bases on both sides, and the roads were built in an arch shape to facilitate drainage. In this way, the wooden stalls cannot encroach on the roads, and water will not accumulate in the market. This greatly improves the order of the vegetable market and the convenience of vegetable buyers. The vegetable market is currently two stories high and can accommodate more than two hundred stalls. Another floor can be added. The buildings are solid and the style is quite beautiful. The light and air are very sufficient. The front faces Beijing Road. Four shops are set up downstairs and have all been rented out. The staircase facing the street on the second floor of the vegetable market is also built here. The back of the vegetable market faces the Suzhou River. The downstairs is rented to a land goods shop, but the road surface has also been widened so that the loading and unloading of large quantities of vegetables will not obstruct traffic.</p>
<h3>Bandits Hijack Car for Half a Day</h3>
<p>The Motive Remains Unknown</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:40 AM, a customer arrived at the Republic Automobile Company at 549 Avenue Edward VII. Claiming to be surnamed Gu, he rented a car to go to 4 Tatary, Scott Road. Chauffeur Hou Liansheng drove the Shanghai-registered car number 637, French Concession number 12595, taking the passenger who claimed to be surnamed Gu to the aforementioned location. Unexpectedly, upon arriving near 4 Tatary, four or five people were already waiting there. All of them were holding handguns. After the car stopped, they swarmed into the car, ordering the chauffeur not to make a sound. Then, the bandits drove the car straight towards Ningguo Road. At a deserted location, they let the chauffeur go after having him guarded by two bandits for a long time. The chauffeur then reported the incident to the 5th District, 4th Precinct Public Security Bureau and the Yangshupu Police Station, requesting an investigation. Around 1:30 PM, the car hijacked by the bandits was suddenly discovered in front of the Anhui Guild Hall on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei. A police sergeant reported this to the 4th District Public Security Bureau, who then took the car to the main bureau, awaiting the owner to claim it.</p>
<h3>Li Yunpeng Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Left a Suicide Note Apologizing to the Hotel</p>
<p>Claimed to Spiritually Protect Their Business Development</p>
<p>At the Xiangxing Inn, number 6, 8 Mile Bridge Road, West Xinzha Road, around 4 PM the day before yesterday, a young man arrived. He was wearing a white-gray cotton robe, Western-style trousers, and leather shoes. The tea attendant led him to room number 11 on the third floor. He paid a deposit of six dimes for the room. He wrote down "Li Yunpeng from Ningbo, 22 years old, bookseller" in the register. Soon after, he started writing a letter in the room, appearing quite happy. Around 7 PM, he called the tea attendant for dinner. Afterward, he went out to mail the letter. Upon returning, he bought a newspaper. Nothing unusual happened that night. Yesterday morning at 8 AM, he got up and paced alone in the room, looking unwell. Between 9 and 10 AM, the tea attendant heard a sound of something hitting the wall coming from room number 11. He immediately went inside to check and saw the man’s face pale. He heard moaning sounds coming from his throat. He found a bottle of Atolin sleeping pills on the table, but the pills were all gone, and a suicide note. The tea attendant accompanied him to the Western Tibet Road Epidemic Hospital for treatment. The inn even paid a dollar for the registration fee. It was said that Li had taken too much poison and his life was in danger. The suicide note is attached below: To the esteemed management of the hotel: I am writing to inform you that I find life meaningless, so I have decided to commit suicide. Because I have no suitable place to die, I have reluctantly come to your hotel to use it temporarily as my final resting place. I, Yunpeng, cannot contribute to society and only eat the rice of the nation, so I think it is best to commit suicide. However, I feel very sorry for dying in your hotel. I can only ask the hotel owner to understand. If I have a spirit after death, I will definitely protect the development of your hotel business. Please acknowledge this. Respectfully, Li Yunpeng, January 6th.</p>
<h3>A Story of an Unfortunate Romance with a Fan</h3>
<p>Like a Fragment of an Old Novel</p>
<p>Now Resulting in a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Jiang Gongyu, the owner of Dafeng Lace Store at number 323, East Gonghe Lane, Fuzhou Road, was standing in front of his store enjoying the cool air on the evening of the third day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. A female traveler named Qi Yuying, staying at the adjacent Jiangsu Inn, accidentally dropped her fan in front of Jiang. Jiang looked up and saw the young and beautiful woman. He couldn't help but be moved. He picked up the fan and took it upstairs to her room, using the opportunity to express his affection. He learned that the woman was from Caonitan, Jiashan, 19 years old, and still a young maiden. She had come to Shanghai with her cousin Wang Lanying to shop for her wedding dowry and was staying at the inn. Jiang took advantage of the fact that Qi's companions had gone out shopping and started to seduce her. Yuying was indeed charmed, and Jiang opened another room for them to have a good time together, vowing to stay together forever. After Qi returned to her hometown, Jiang could not forget her. On June 26th, he went to Jiashan to visit her and then brought her back to Shanghai to stay temporarily at the Central Hotel. Once his desire was satisfied, he allowed her to return home. Unexpectedly, on November 29th, he again brought her to Shanghai to live together at number 37, West Lin Road. Eventually, Jiang's wife found out, and a jealous dispute arose. They moved back to the Jiangsu Inn. Qi's mother, Qi Xi, after her beloved daughter disappeared, sent her son Qi Yunxiang to search for her everywhere. Recently, they found her. The mother said that her daughter had already been promised to a man surnamed Zhu, so how could she allow Jiang to have an affair with her? Moreover, Jiang was already a married man, so he should not defile a respectable girl. She hired a lawyer and filed a criminal lawsuit against Jiang at the First Special District Court, requesting that he be punished according to Article 257 of the criminal law for seducing a girl under 20 years old. She also filed a civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay 5,000 yuan in compensation for damage to her reputation and 290 yuan for travel expenses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao of the First Special Court held a hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Qu Zheng to defend him. The lawyer argued that the preliminary issue in this case was to clarify jurisdiction before proceeding with the trial. After debating with the plaintiff's lawyer, Judge Ge confirmed that the defendant's residence was on West Lin Road, which was not under the jurisdiction of this court. The court announced that both parties should wait for the case to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Should Not Insult Judges</h3>
<p>Lawyer Liu Mingdu Sent to the Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</p>
<p>Lawyer Liu Du, representing Xu Xianglin in a cohabitation case with his wife Xu Shen, reached a settlement in the Civil Division of the District Court. Xu was to pay his wife living expenses every month. After the settlement, Xu Shen requested enforcement. Judge He Yuliu of the Execution Division of the court enforced the order according to the law, demanding payment from Xu Xianglin and ordering Xu's guarantor to report to the court. Failure to comply would result in detention. However, the lawyer did not understand that the judge was bound by the original case when enforcing the order. He filed a protest, arguing that Xu Shen had not fulfilled the conditions and that the judge should not act so forcefully. He accused the judge of being biased and violating the law. Judge He was greatly angered by this, believing that lawyers should not deliberately insult judges. The court treats all parties equally, and any accusation of illegal bias must be supported by evidence. Therefore, he reopened the execution hearing yesterday. The lawyer remained defiant, so the judge sent Lawyer Liu to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Responsibility for a Bus Running Over a Worker</h3>
<p>The Key Lies in Opening the Bus Door</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses Can Come Forward to Testify</p>
<p>At 6:15 PM on the 2nd of this month, Liu Guangxi, a worker at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, took bus number 15003 from Avenue Bai-li-nan to Gordon Road. Upon arriving at the stop, because there were many people waiting for the bus, the bus continued driving forward without stopping. Liu argued with the bus conductor, and Feng Bofang, a passenger who was an employee of the bus company, rang the bell to make the bus stop. Unexpectedly, as soon as Feng got off the bus, he stumbled and was run over by the bus. Indian constables arrived and took the injured person to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died. The police charged the ticket seller number 209 with negligence causing death and brought him to the First Special District Court for prosecution yesterday morning. Feng Bofang initially testified as a witness. After the police lawyer presented the case, ticket seller 209 testified that Feng was a coach in the bus company who specialized in training ticket sellers and should know all the regulations. Therefore, all ticket sellers should obey his orders. On that day, Feng saw that there were many passengers at the Gordon Road stop and ordered the bus not to stop. Later, when the deceased wanted to get off the bus, Feng opened the door and let him off, resulting in him being run over. However, at that time, I was selling tickets inside the bus, and I didn't open the door. Feng Bofang testified that he saw the deceased arguing with the ticket seller, and to avoid a dispute on the bus, he rang the bell to stop the bus and the ticket seller opened the door to let him off. Next, Mr. Danweier, representing the bus company, testified that Feng was not a coach or ticket seller. Bao Laigao, a friend of the deceased, testified that the deceased said in the hospital that the ticket seller opened the door halfway and pushed him off. Other witnesses testified that they saw the deceased being run over. Because the key to this case lies in opening the bus door and the testimonies of the witnesses and parties involved are contradictory, further investigation is needed. The court scheduled a retrial on the 12th of this month. Feng Bofang is temporarily detained. If anyone witnessed the whole truth on the bus that day, coming forward to testify would be beneficial to the case. It is hoped that they will come to court to testify at the next hearing.</p>

<h3>Three Policies for Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>- Zhang Xiyu</p>
<p>To protect the fragmented land, to reunite scattered people, and to defend against the current national crisis, the government must first implement three policies:</p>
<p>1.  Abolish the one-party rule policy, replacing it with a government of national talents. Integrate the Ning-Yue-Gui faction, the Northeast faction, the Northwest faction, and famous figures in and out of office, both civilian and military. Sacrifice previous personal rights and territorial thinking. Elect several people with great talent, broad-mindedness, fairness, and patriotism to take overall charge and build a sound government. Formulate a policy program. From top to bottom, all people should have the same goal, to discuss specific plans for resisting the enemy and saving the country, to know how to defend against the powerful, how to save the dying, how to gather the dispersed, how to reassure the people, how to eliminate bandits and communists, and how to consolidate security. Move after deliberation and enter after measurement. Those who can implement the national salvation policy should be supported by the people. Those who harbor ambitions and seek personal development should be driven out by the people. The government should lead in front and the people should support in the rear. All should be of one heart and one mind, and jointly face the national crisis. Order the strict dissolution of the current so-called provincial, municipal, and county party headquarters, cancel the use of national treasury for party headquarters expenses and the use of local public funds, to reduce waste and eliminate evil elements who use the party to exploit the people, so as to eliminate public grievances and eradicate the bad habits of warlord politics, and prevent their resurgence. In this way, the people of the world will know that the government is selfless and has the determination to change course with the people. It is time to issue a great call to rouse the public.</p>
<p>2.  Organize a National Council for National Salvation. Set up provincial and county councils. Elect outstanding individuals from the whole country, the whole province, and the whole county to participate in politics, discuss all national salvation matters, and what should be promoted and reformed locally. Supervise governments at all levels, review budgets and final accounts. The government can be impeached and reorganized for dereliction of duty. Political affairs should be open to public opinion, and the many details should be held in the central government. Individual tyranny can be eliminated, and political integrity will come in time. If one party monopolizes political power, it has already misled the people into the pain of national subjugation. One faction fails, and the other faction takes its place. The so-called division of spoils may be repeated in the future. The melons of Huangtai cannot be picked again. The hearts of the people are not dead. It is appropriate for the youth, students, elders, and recluses of the whole country to run around, cry, and urge the government to rise up and save the country. However, the foolish government has no plans and only relies on the League of Nations for a chance to escape. If Jinzhou is lost, and the areas outside the Guan are ravaged, then North China will continue to fall. I fear that the situation of joint administration will soon appear and we will not even be able to relocate to the south and establish a small court.</p>
<p>3.  Rectify the military. According to current statistics, there are about two million soldiers in our country, not to mention the bandit-style miscellaneous troops and local militias. Now, the government should issue an order to the military throughout the country to eliminate the old and weak and select the strong, with one soldier and one gun as the unit. The central government should organize a reorganization committee to assign them separately. According to the national defense situation and financial capacity, divide them into several divisions as national defense forces with definite combat power. They should be sent to the front lines in stages to respond to the national crisis. At the same time, a part of the military force should be used to suppress the bandits and communists. This is a temporary solution, but the fundamental plan is to implement conscription, which can eliminate the evils of recruitment, save national financial resources, and strengthen national power. This is related to internal affairs, and local autonomy must be realized, with household registration and specialized personnel. It cannot be done hastily. However, autonomy is the foundation of internal affairs, and conscription is the necessity of national defense. If those in power can choose the wise and appoint the able, they can do it quickly. Judging from the level of the people, autonomy should adopt a policy of intervention and conservation, not an extremely free policy, or a policy of slogans on walls. This is something that cannot be realized. Major military matters, such as warships, coastal defense fortresses, and improved armories, cannot be done without a long time and significant financial resources. If no preparations are made in peacetime, it is futile to discuss it in times of emergency. Therefore, I will not repeat myself. (Retribution)</p>

<p>Not Removing the Weeds in the Garden - Jifu Talks</p>
<h3>Inverted Logic</h3>
<p>Talks by Bu Tingzhai, weeding the garden, Cang</p>
<p>Chinese national affairs are topsy-turvy. This topsy-turviness is due to inverted logic.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek said:</p>
<p>"Internal pacification must precede external resistance."</p>
<p>Sun Zhesheng said:</p>
<p>"Saving the party must precede saving the country."</p>
<p>My view is exactly the opposite of Chiang and Sun:</p>
<p>"External resistance must precede internal pacification;</p>
<p>Saving the country must precede saving the party."</p>
<p>Chiang and Sun may say that I have inverted the truth. I don't need to argue strongly. Let the facts prove it themselves.</p>
<h3>Mourning Zhu Suoyu</h3>
<p>- Zizai</p>
<p>Zhu Guwei Shiyu of Gui'an. A master of ci poetry. His calligraphy blended the styles of Yan and Liu. He was admired by the world. After the Qing Emperor abdicated in the Xinhai Revolution, he changed his name to Xiaozang. When writing poems or calligraphy, he used the aliases Qiangcun Oujun, etc., and did not use his original name, Zumou. He lived in Deyu Lane, East Youheng Road for a long time. He was close to his old friends Zeng Nongran, Wang Bingshan, Wang Xuecheng. They spent every evening composing poems and discussing art. After Nongran and Xuecheng passed away, he became lonely and unhappy. He often played mahjong to pass the time. In recent years, he was often unwell, but he still did not give up writing poetry and practicing calligraphy. A few months ago, for medical convenience, he moved to Guling Road. Dysentery occurred from time to time. Unexpectedly, it lingered for several months, and medicine was ineffective. On the 30th of last month, he passed away, leaving his friends and parting from this world. The people of China mourned him. I remember when he was the chief examiner of a certain subject in Guangdong, he had a minor feud with Cen Chunxuan, the Governor-General of Liangguang. When Zhu issued the exam questions, he satirized Cen a lot, such as "The inch of heart can be higher than Cen's building", "Spring is the word for foolish", "How can one get daylilies", etc. At that time, Cen was powerful in Guangdong, but there was nothing he could do about Zhu's rebelliousness. When I went to Guangdong last month, I met Wang Jingwu (Jingwei's brother) on Haoxian Street. He asked me about Zhu's recent situation with great concern and asked me to extend his regards. How could I know that on the day I returned to Shanghai, it was when Zhu returned to Daoshan. I failed to fulfill his trust. I feel very sorry. As I write this, I am filled with emotion.</p>
<h3>Talking About Toys in the New Year of National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>A garden without flowers cannot be called a garden. A home without children can hardly be called a home. Indeed, children are a comforting, sweet name full of all the hopes in the universe. In a precarious and weak country like ours, our expectations for children are all the more urgent. For the cruel enemy has left us with only one path of resistance: to settle accounts with the invaders. That is today's children. In our country's old customs, parents regarded children as either mere playthings or as servants. So-called love often ends up harming them. So-called education actually hinders their development. Such losses cannot be redeemed at any price. Therefore, this article is intended to advise parents to pay attention to the basic needs of children.</p>
<p>The basic needs of childhood are sleep, diet, and play. Sometimes they even play in their dreams. They eat while playing. Play almost dominates their entire lives. Play is a kind of natural and interesting activity. It can be divided into three categories: first, entertainment (Amusement), which is passive and aims to soothe the emotions and delight the mind with pictures and stories; second, games (Game), which involve dramatic imagination and have a specific purpose, such as chess and riddles; and third, sports (Sports), which mostly involve outdoor physical competition, such as swimming and boat racing. The use of toys is mostly in the categories of entertainment and games.</p>
<p>Toys are tools for children's play. They stimulate their imagination and facilitate activities in their imaginative world, imitating the behavior of adults. Although toys are small, they have a significant and profound relationship with individuals and the nation. For children are the future masters of the country. The suggestions conveyed by toys are deeply imprinted on children's nervous systems and cannot be erased. If these suggestions are healthy and lively, their educational value is immeasurable. But if they are base and vulgar, they will cause endless harm. At this New Year, as every household buys toys, I hope that people will not see them merely as objects for children to play with to amuse them. Know that they contain scientific elements and can develop children's senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, physical movement, and internal organs, and stimulate the growth of intelligence, morality, physical well-being, social skills, and aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>The selection of toys should focus on four standards: simplicity, durability, beauty, and affordability. Good toys have life and can stimulate children's own actions. Building blocks, beanbags, climbing ladders, balls, dolls, and animal models are toys that children will play with repeatedly without getting tired, and they can increase their creativity, self-confidence, and self-esteem. For example, bathing, dressing, feeding, and decorating dolls. Using building blocks to build houses, bridges, tables, towers, castles, and barracks. Sandboxes are often found in schools, but rarely in homes. I urge my fellow countrymen to set them up, so that children's natural abilities can be advanced. What they hear and see on a daily basis can be expressed through sandboxes. For example, the brutal acts of the Japanese invaders and their plans to save the country can all be seen in the sandbox. In the future, they will become pillars of the country.</p>
<p>The materials for toys should be rubber, wood, bamboo, celluloid, etc., so that they are easy to clean and durable. On the other hand, wool, mud, lead, iron, and thin paper are not only unhygienic but also not durable. The colors of toys should cater to children's psychology. The colors that children like are red, followed by blue, green, purple, yellow, white, and black. Younger children especially like light and colorful shades, which are inspiring and exciting. At a time when the nation is declining, it can inspire people to work hard and achieve something. Sometimes children abandon new cars worth thirty or forty gold coins to play with old square stools. Expensive stone lions, trains, etc., are not as attractive as broken watches and hats. A tree, a leaf, a pebble, or a bamboo pole in nature is better than any other toy. Therefore, toys do not have to be expensive, but they must be psychologically appropriate. They do not have to be bought from abroad; they can be made at home. Considering the ancient toys of our country, "hitting the earth" in the time of Yao and "kicking the ball" in the time of Xuanyuan are all worth promoting.</p>
<p>Age is inversely proportional to toys. The older they get, the less enthusiastic they are about playing. The period of greatest interest is at age six, after which it gradually decreases. By age eighteen, it has dropped sharply. This is a statistic from Cooswell's study of two thousand children. But we must know that babies can shake, push, and stroke toys when they are one month old, and can knock and ring bells at eight months. Toys that are easy to put in the mouth and are not easy to disinfect or wash should not be provided. Mouth flutes and harmonicas, which need to be blown with the mouth, should not be borrowed from each other to avoid spreading diseases. It is hoped that large-scale department stores will hire specialists who are familiar with the psychology of children's toys to guide manufacturers and customers, which would benefit the country and the nation in no small measure.</p>

<h3>A Tale of Two Soldiers (3)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Quest for Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter One: A peerless courtesan lives alone, yearning for her beautiful companion, and a scholar fleeing his hometown forges a strange bond.</p>
<p>In addition, she had a delicate mind, a dashing style, a clear and bright radiance, clever and subtle speech, an outstanding spirit, and a healthy physique. All the different qualities that people desire in a beautiful woman, whether lively or chaste, heroic or gentle, can be found in her demeanor and deportment, satisfying the different tastes of those who admired her. Coincidentally, she was also at the perfect age of sixteen, transplanted from Suzhou to Beijing, and absorbed the clever and elegant qualities of both the north and the south, further helping her to rise to the top and become the pride of her youth, a perfect fairy. She firmly sat in the first place among the famous courtesans in Beijing's flower world, if not unprecedented, at least unparalleled. However, this wonderful person, through various coincidences of heaven, earth, and man, was produced with great difficulty, falling into the red-light district like Chang'e descending to earth. The wealthy and patrons who had the privilege of witnessing her glory realized that this blessing was not easily attained, so they were unwilling to miss the opportunity. Naturally, based on the principle of seizing the day, a wealthy and skilled merchant spent a great deal of effort and gritted his teeth to pay an extremely high price in the human flesh market, like an auction, to buy her. He hid her away like a rare treasure in his vault-like golden house. This man, who had particularly good luck and enjoyed the number one beauty, was said to be an old bureaucrat who had served as several ministers and later founded a bank. At that time, he did such a sensational thing, which truly envied many lechers and angered several patrons. However, he could not enjoy it for long. After only half a year of enjoyment, even his steel vault developed cracks for no reason and could not hold this living treasure. Originally, a fat and corrupt person did not have the good fortune or the ability to do such a thing. Relying solely on a pile of rotten paper-like banknotes to acquire such a fresh, lively, and peerless beauty was already excessive. Yet, he still acted against conscience, daydreaming, and based on some kind of ownership or exclusive right, insisted on treating the beauty as a plaything, imprisoning her in his house and selfishly enjoying her alone. How cruel and stingy was this! Could it be that the spirit of heaven and earth, which is very difficult to embody, and this rarest of beauties, were born solely to be enjoyed by such an old fool? No way! Regardless of face, heaven and earth cannot tolerate such injustice. He should wake up a bit!</p>

<h3>Statistical Table of Silver Dollars Deposited in Chinese and Foreign Banks for the 20th Year</h3>
<p>When the silver market is loose, the amount of silver dollars stored in Chinese and foreign banks in this city is rarely noticed. This time, the inspection of warehouses has no major impact on the market. If the silver market is tight and the sources and uses of silver are active, detailed attention should be paid. After all, the current surplus or deficit in the Shanghai market has a significant impact on the market. At the end of the 20th year, when the silver market was transitioning from tight to loose, there were many people who needed silver dollars. However, the financial sector ignored this. The time when the annual bonus will be distributed is approaching, and the commercial market is depressed. There is no need to use silver dollars. Therefore, the bank's warehouse inspection report is not intended to be publicized to all sectors. Overall, the Chinese merchants' reserves are lower than before, and the foreign merchants' reserves are even lower. This shows that the current silver reserves in the Shanghai market are not abundant. In contrast, the total amount at the end of the 19th year of the Republic of China was almost one-third higher than the current amount, while foreign banks were more than two-thirds higher. The accurate figures for the major silver dollar deposits are listed below (unit: ten thousand silver dollars):</p>

<p>Bank of China: 11,682,970　　Sumitomo: 110,55</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Trend Upward</h3>
<p>Trend is Peaceful and Atmosphere is Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Exchange's bond market saw several spot trades opening, with continued activity in buying and selling. Futures trading remained limited to the January contract, with no transactions for the February contract. Bond fluctuations continued, with little change in the domestic and international situation. The bond market environment remained as dull as before, but market sentiment was more stable than before. The price trend was also much more moderate than before, without the significant ups and downs of the past. Statistics show that price fluctuations were mostly limited to around one yuan, with a general slight rebound compared to the previous day. Among them, the 1920 National Loan rose by one yuan and four jiao, while the 1920 Salt Revenue Loan and other futures contracts rose by eight or nine jiao each. The rest also rose by about half a yuan. Only the Consolidated 6% Customs Loan continued to fall slightly, while spot goods such as the Disbandment Loan and the 1920 Consolidated Tax Loan remained significantly lower than at the end of last year. The sudden rebound in prices is likely due to the significant declines of the previous day and the current low prices. There was some investment in the market, and buying activity slightly increased, which was a natural reaction after the decline. There were no other major reasons affecting the market. Although the bond market environment seems slightly more optimistic than before, the approaching Lunar New Year and the uncertain situation make it difficult to expand. It is feared that a strong rally will be difficult to achieve in the short term. The total spot trading volume for the day was 53,000 yuan, with futures trading reaching approximately 2.7 million yuan in the morning and over 1.5 million yuan in the afternoon, for a total of 4.23 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Show Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, but the situation remains lackluster. The Japanese invasion is intensifying, the silver market is extremely tight, and public sentiment is poor. Most retail investors are bearish. However, the Sichuan yarn merchants are still actively procuring, while other merchants are doing just okay.</p>
<p>The price of standard yarn rose by 6 qian this month. The opening of the Shanghai Standard Yarn Exchange saw slightly improved buying interest due to rising gold and cotton prices in the United States. Prices rose by 2-3 qian for each month. In the afternoon, prices were flat, rising by 1-2 qian for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 7,000 bales. Changfeng sold 500 bales, Tongxing 400 bales, Yuda 350 bales, and Yida 500 bales. Yichang bought 500 bales, Dachang 550 bales, Xincheng 300 bales, and Xinhua 300 bales. The closing prices are recorded below, showing the gains, losses, and account balances for each month at the Shanghai Standard Yarn Exchange:</p>
<p>Month Closing Price Gain/Loss Account Balance Month Closing Price Gain/Loss Account Balance</p>
<p>January 15.24 Up 6 459500 April 15.39 Up 4 51700</p>

<p>March 15.35 364000 June 15.39 122750</p>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Continue Active Procurement The sales of current yarn are still good. Statistics show that various merchants purchased a total of 1,600 bales throughout the day. The Tonghang Merchants purchased 10 bales, and the market was flat. Among the out-of-town merchants, Gaoyang purchased 80 bales, Tianjin 25 bales, Sichuan 1,000 bales, inland areas 290 bales, Luzhou 40 bales, Shantou 60 bales, Guangdong 20 bales, and miscellaneous merchants 20 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Firmness</h3>
<p>The cotton market is softening, but overseas cotton markets are slightly firm, and rising gold prices have led to a slight tightening of sentiment. The situation was slightly firmer in the morning. However, the political unrest in India poses a risk of instability in Indian cotton prices. Furthermore, actual demand is stagnant, with factories showing no intention of procuring, and the financial situation is extremely tight. Therefore, the market situation is very weak.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Cotton Shows Slight Improvement The opening of the Hankou Standard Cotton Exchange saw a slight shortage of sellers due to rising gold and cotton prices in the United States. Prices rose by 1 qian for each month. In the afternoon, prices fell by 5 fen for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 40,900 dan. Mingde sold 1,100 dan, Tongxing 1,800 dan, Yichang 1,400 dan, Yuchang 2,800 dan, and Xincheng 1,600 dan. Houfeng bought 1,000 dan, Yiyu 1,300 dan, Yuanda 2,300 dan, Senkang 1,400 dan, and Hengde 1,500 dan. The closing prices are recorded below, showing the gains, losses, and account balances for each month at the Hankou Standard Cotton Exchange:</p>
<p>Month Closing Price Gain/Loss Account Balance Month Closing Price Gain/Loss Account Balance</p>

<p>March 37.51 182900 June 22.50 1566800</p>
<p>Spot Trading Flat Spot cotton trading is flat, with 260 bales of Yao cotton arriving.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton at 30. New Arrivals at 600 Current goods sent to factories, 23.00, another 1,000 bales, again.</p>
<h3>American and British Cotton Show Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton saw a calm and firm market due to buying by foreign merchants and strength from Wall Street. The futures price rose by 10-13 points, and the spot price rose by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 8 points, and spot prices rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 6th):</p>

<h3>Grain Prices of River-Bottom Rice Rise Frequently</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, sources from various merchants were scarce. Due to the early morning snowfall and increased prices in the city, sentiment was bullish, and fresh, thick, and thin japonica rice became more active. Prices rose by 2 jiao. Early and late season rice arrived in small quantities, and Ningbo rice was slightly available. Market prices also increased by nearly 1 jiao. Yangdu pointed rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the situation continued to be firm. Yinyuan rice was not available, and high-grade materials were also traded in small quantities. Medium-grade rice remained mediocre. The market situation temporarily remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Limited sources. Trading in this street was more active than the previous market. Local rice was the most popular in the morning opening. Lishu rice prices rose by 2 jiao, and thin rice was scarce. Prices also increased by another jiao. Yangzeng pointed rice arrivals were slightly lower, but the demand was still strong, leading to a price increase of about 1 jiao. Du pointed rice was temporarily stable due to the influence of western rice.</p>
<h3>Current Foreign Rice is Well Absorbed</h3>
<p>Guest Yuan Continues to Be Shipped North</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for foreign rice in Muji Street remained active. However, with new arrivals, it was difficult for prices to rise. Futures were continuously sold off by foreign firms, and prices were also flat. However, news that stored rice in Jiangxi and Hunan would no longer be shipped out, and that guest Xian rice from various regions would not be arriving in Shanghai, led to some optimism among some people, and the market stabilized. The Tong market opened with 4,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at 9.90 to 5.80 yuan. 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were priced at 10.08 to 9 jiao. Xiaojiao March rice opened at 2,000 tons, priced at approximately 4 taels and 4 qian 3 fen. All were purchased by merchants in this street. 450 bags of Jiangyuan rice continued to open, purchased by merchants from Tianjin and Yantai, priced at 13.75 to 12.5 jiao. Due to the local digestion, the market was active.</p>
<h3>Biao Fen (Standard Flour) Auction Suspended Yesterday Morning Due to Deficiency in Guarantee Money</h3>
<p>Auction Resumed as Usual in the Afternoon... Limited Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw the auction suspended in the morning before the opening due to guarantee money deficiencies, with the amount reportedly around 200,000 to 300,000. As the exchange placed great importance on this, the market was suspended. By the afternoon, most of the guarantee money had been collected, so the market resumed as usual. However, under these circumstances, there were few transactions between buyers and sellers. The initial market showed a slightly softer trend than the previous day. Later, as there were very few sellers, the market slightly stabilized. Looking at the future, as customer sales have been good recently, the market may temporarily stabilize. As a result, the price for the current month remained unchanged, February was down 0.25%, and March/April were unchanged, while May/June were up 0.5%.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Temporarily Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market initially showed signs of stability, followed by flatness. In the morning, the market slightly rebounded due to buying from outside speculators and reports that Tianjin merchants had purchased 1,000 tons of spot wheat. However, the market returned to softness in the afternoon opening due to a lack of buying interest. It was reported that the exchange of debt-ridden wheat for cash was nearing completion for three ships, with prices as low as 3 taels and 3 qian. If there are no changes, the future of the wheat market is unlikely to be optimistic. As a result, the price for the current month was down 0.2 fen from the previous month, February/March were unchanged, April was up 1 fen, May was unchanged, and June was up 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Shortage Leads to Extraordinary Price Increases</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar Prices Briefly Stabilize After Rising Sharply Yesterday's sugar market received reports from the production area that the current price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.15625. New York sugar futures were priced at 1.09 for March, 1.12 for May, and 1.23 for September, all down 0.03 from the previous report. December was priced at 1.31, also down 0.01. The current and futures prices for Javanese sugar remained unchanged. Trading at the Shanghai Public Association Market was brisk, and market sentiment was positive. The initial transaction price for Dutch No. 24 raw white sugar was 9 taels and 8 qian 5 fen, but supply remained short. Innovators sold over 1,000 bags at the same price, causing the market to turn down. The market later fell to 9 taels and 8 qian 2.5 fen, but there were very few sellers, and the trend was firm. Cotton Dutch sugar was priced at 11 taels and 6 qian, No. 20 medium white sugar at 9 taels and 7 qian 5 fen, and No. 9 Dutch red sugar at 8 taels and 5 qian 5 fen. The market was firm and improving. The supply of Taikoo sugar was even tighter, and prices rose accordingly. B mark sugar rose to 12 taels and 4 qian, HX mark sugar to 11 taels and 8 qian to 8 qian 5 fen, and later to 11 taels and 9 qian. HM mark sugar was at 11 taels and 6 qian 5 fen. Market sentiment remained strong, with signs of further increases. Huaxin sold over 1,000 bags of Dutch red sugar at 8 taels and 5 qian 5 fen, and the trend was also positive. The factory price for rock candy rose to 12 taels and 4 to 5 qian, but the firms' interest in buying was weak, and they remained on the sidelines, so no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Some Transactions for Longans and Preserved Plums</h3>
<p>There was not much development in North-South goods during the past recess. Though daylily was lively, the selling price didn't increase. Cellophane noodles rose slightly, but other goods like red and black dates, walnuts, almonds, wood ears, Xianglian, and pickled mustard root didn't see many customers. However, longans had been silent for a long time due to dealings between brokers, but recently there has been movement. Top-grade spring bubble longans were around 54 taels or so, and wholesale business is expected to open up within days, which is up about 2 taels compared to the [previous] price. After this, the market should be in a stabilizing trend.</p>
<h3>500 Tons of Hardware Zinc Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been very quiet because all the shops are closing up. Arriving goods are still numerous, and the future seems withering. 500 tons of zinc came in yesterday, so market stocks are even thicker, and everyone is even more fatigued. The standard is estimated at 14 taels and 2 qian 5 fen, but if there were a big deal, the price could be 2 qian 5 fen cheaper.</p>

<h3>A Small Declaration by This Publication</h3>
<p>— Gou Fo</p>
<p>Stating the Aims of This Publication</p>
<p>Please Offer Guidance, Readers</p>
<p>The "Supplement to This City," originally an appendage to this newspaper, | the "Free Talk" everyone calls it the newspaper's "butt," and the "Supplement" naturally fits that category as well | but its relationship with readers, though different in terms of available time, is really no different.</p>
<p>The "Supplement" and this newspaper are absolutely different. The "Supplement" simply does not discuss politics or the overall situation. As the saying goes, "Here, we can only discuss the wind and the moon." The "Supplement" is originally a separate world, not standing in the same field as this newspaper. For example, in opera, the "Three Reports" sing grand, heavy-faced operas and old man operas, while the "Supplement" only performs small comedic plays like "Spinning Cotton" and "Fan Notes," etc. For example, in drinking, this newspaper is big fish, big meat, big chicken, big duck, while the "Supplement" is only a few small dishes of pickles and pickled cucumbers, eating porridge.</p>
<p>Since the "Supplement" is neither grand cuisine nor grand opera, the materials we select should naturally focus on the humorous, interesting, refreshing, and thought-provoking. Therefore, although the "Supplement" and this newspaper have the same relationship with readers, there is a serious/leisure distinction in the emotional impact of the "Supplement" and this newspaper on readers.</p>
<p>What about national affairs? So pessimistic and dismal. What about society? So chaotic and dark. Since we don't discuss national affairs, we should all think of ways to improve, correct, and guide social affairs. We don't want to be like "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night," following the dark, degenerate society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of our editing the "Supplement" is to</p>
<p>Expose the superstition in superstitious aspects of society.</p>
<p>Expose the degeneration in degenerate aspects of society.</p>
<p>However, the so-called "exposure" of the "Supplement" is not to attack the privacy of individuals, but to attack common and general problems in society, or individual misconduct that can represent the general. We can only use abstract terms to describe them, and we cannot attack by name. This is the morality that the "Supplement" should uphold.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the source of culture in our country, and at the same time, Shanghai is also the den of all evils in our country. This is an undeniable fact. Promoting extravagance, promoting romance, promoting freehand style, and even adultery, looting, male banditry, and female prostitution are all special products of Shanghai society.</p>
<p>That being said, after all, the "Supplement to This City" is not a "Discussion on Shanghai Local Autonomy," nor is it a "Guide to Shanghai," attacking the corruption and darkness of Shanghai (or not just Shanghai) every day, exposing the weaknesses of Shanghai society in every article. What's the point?</p>
<p>Therefore, the second purpose of the "Supplement" is</p>
<p>From a negative perspective, it is absolutely not to cooperate with the dark and evil society, and we must issue a general attack order.</p>
<p>From a positive perspective, the "Supplement" absolutely supports and promotes literature, art, science, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, poetry, craftsmanship, painting, and all good deeds and special creations in society are all things that the "Supplement" is very willing to promote. However, the "Supplement's" method of promotion is not to seek from the large and distant, but only to seek from the small and near, not to seek a living from dry and tasteless places, but to seek a living from happy and interesting places.</p>
<p>Therefore, the tentative table of contents of this publication is</p>
<p>Small Forum</p>
<p>Popular Literature and Art</p>
<p>Popular Science</p>
<p>Street Sociology</p>
<p>East, West, South, North</p>
<p>Shanghai Stories</p>
<p>The table of contents listed above is only a hypothetical based on occasional remembrance. If we encounter better topics, or if we cannot be limited by the above titles, we will modify or add them at any time. They are not fixed and unchanging rules.</p>
<p>The reform of the "Supplement" is due to a hasty decision, so there was not enough preparation. Although we have this small wish, the editor's knowledge is limited, and we need everyone to help and guide us. As the saying goes, "A nun raising a pig, everyone serves it." This is the glory of the "Supplement" and also the merit of the readers. This is what all the "Supplement's" editors sincerely pray for.</p>

<h3>Autumn Leaves</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>The wind rises,</p>
<p>Don't know how,</p>
<p>We gather into a pile.</p>
<p>The wind rises again,</p>
<p>Don't know how,</p>
<p>We scatter everywhere.</p>
<p>Who controls us?</p>
<p>Is it the wind?</p>
<p>We hate it—</p>
<p>We thank it.</p>
<p>We arrive beside you,</p>
<p>Or you arrive beside us,</p>
<p>If you don't pay attention, then don't pay attention;</p>
<p>If you trample on us, then trample on us;</p>
<p>If you pick us up to look at, then please do—</p>
<p>Everything is up to you.</p>
<p>Do we have some red color?</p>
<p>Will you take it as the charming beauty of spring flowers?</p>
<p>Or will you take it as the sad tears of blood?</p>
<p>Do we have some yellow color?</p>
<p>Will you take it as glory—</p>
<p>Or will you take it as withering?</p>
<p>We are still complete,</p>
<p>Will you think that our past is perfect?</p>
<p>We are already broken,</p>
<p>Will you think that our past is flawed?</p>
<p>We can't worry about so much,</p>
<p>Let you think what you will;</p>
<p>Maybe it is, maybe it isn't;</p>
<p>Maybe it's all, maybe it's none.</p>
<p>We are a pile accidentally gathered from all directions,</p>
<p>We will still go to all directions,</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the wind,</p>
<p>And form an affinity with you.</p>
<p>No matter what the result,</p>
<p>We all feel very happy.</p>
<p>Ah, the wind is rising again,</p>
<p>Please watch us, leaf after leaf, slowly drift,</p>
<p>If you wish.</p>
<p>Popular Science</p>
<h3>Scientific Games</h3>
<p>— Jing Shu</p>
<p>After finishing my lessons on Sunday, the wind and rain were gloomy. Several neighborhood children pestered me to tell them stories to relieve their boredom. I thought that instead of making up some magical and bizarre anecdotes, it would be better to take advantage of the situation and play some scientific games to instill common sense in them. The following are some of the things I searched my brains for, remembering what my teachers and friends told me (of course, I didn't invent them) and performed for the children, and they all shouted "Good!" I am writing them out to provide the children who read this publication with a way to pass the time.</p>
<p>(1) Flowers Appearing on White Paper Ask your mother for a handful of washing soda, dissolve it in clear water, and draw a bunch of orchids on white paper. Then take the vinegar used in the kitchen and draw a few flowers in the middle of the orchids. After the paper dries, it will be as white as before. Then ask a chemistry teacher for a little "litmus" solution. At this time, tell the children, "Look! I can spray immortal water to make flowers and plants appear on the white paper!" After saying this, secretly hold the "litmus" solution and a mouthful of clear water in your mouth. Chant incantations, shout "Diseases be gone!" and spray on the paper. Suddenly, blue orchids and red flowers will appear on the flawless white paper.</p>
<p>Reason After the children finish praising and laughing, naturally explain the principle to them, to avoid mistakenly believing in real magic. The principle of the above trick is very simple. Washing soda is one of the chemicals called "alkaline substances." Vinegar is one of the "acidic substances." "Litmus" is an "indicator" of alkalinity and acidity. It turns red when it encounters acid and blue when it encounters alkali. Therefore, spraying "litmus" on white paper coated with alkali and vinegar will reveal blue grass and red flowers.</p>
<p>(2) Fire Burning on Water Take a strip of rolled paper and secretly hide a small piece of "sodium" or "potassium" at the bottom end (sodium and potassium are both metallic elements and can be obtained from a chemistry teacher). Then fill a shallow plate with clear water. After the preparation is complete, tell the children, "I can make the paper roll burn on the water." Then lightly touch the water with the end containing potassium and sodium, and immediately lift it up. The paper roll will immediately explode and then burn.</p>
<p>Reason "Sodium" and "potassium" are both elements that easily combine with water, and they decompose water, releasing "light gas." "Light gas" is very easy to ignite spontaneously, and with the help of "oxygen" in the air, the great heat generated by the combination of "sodium" and "potassium" with water will burn the "light gas," affecting the paper roll.</p>

<h3>On the Public Bus</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Because of a small matter, I took a public bus to North Sichuan Road. This was exactly the day Jinzhou fell -.</p>
<p>Several men and women from the island country were already sitting on the bus. Each one had an uncontainable smile of victory on their face, and each smiling face was like a sharp knife, stabbing straight into my heart, making me feel a kind of indescribable shame and grief. I was silent, silently reciting the slogans of "Down with XX Imperialism" posted on the mirror frames of the shops on both sides. I thought, there will be a day...</p>
<p>Probably at the intersection of Bazilu, a woman from the island country, carrying two children, stood at the public bus stop, ready to get on the bus. I cannot determine whether it was intentional or unintentional, but the driver's compatriot did not brake and drove straight on.</p>
<p>Immediately, the men and women from the island country on the bus all stood up. Each smiling face was replaced with a kind of murderous aura, looking at the driver with fierce eyes, mumbling and grumbling in their mouths. Although I don't understand what they were saying, I knew they were questioning the driver for not braking.</p>
<p>Under the serious circumstances, the bus finally backed up. The woman and children from the island country got on the bus, and the men and women from the island country on the bus all stood up to give up their seats. A kind of passionate love for their nation was truly moving.</p>
<p>I fell into a corner, covering my face, afraid of seeing this group of cold faces. But I clearly heard that driver's compatriot muttering to himself, "Alas, this is the difference between people from XX country and Chinese people. If one of their women doesn't make it onto the bus, they all rise up to question it, but when our entire Northeast half of the country is lost, everyone is still calm, patient, and indifferent!"</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Clever Response to K</h3>
<p>On January 4th, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, and Jiang Wenyu invited Feng Yuxiang to dinner at the Bankers' Association. Mr. Mu said, "Today, we have only prepared a bowl of soup, two dishes, and a plate of snacks, which is very meager. It is indeed unprecedented here. However, for Mr. Feng, who is frugal and self-disciplined, eating this is already unprecedented." After Feng delivered a speech on his political views, he also said that when he was in the mountains, he would drink two cups of clear water every morning, walk three thousand steps, and then eat four bowls of millet porridge with a dish of pickled vegetables, which he regarded as a daily routine. Then, he recited a couplet:</p>
<p>Two cups of clear water, three thousand steps,</p>
<p>A dish of pickled vegetables, four bowls of rice.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stories</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stories (II)</h3>
<p>Before Shanghai became a treaty port, it already had a city. During the Song Dynasty, the Shanghai Town Shipping Office was established. In the twenty-ninth year of Zhiyuan in the Yuan Dynasty (i.e., 1292 AD), it was changed to Shanghai County. The current Shanghai County seat is the original site of the county seat established in the Yuan Dynasty. This county seat is on the west bank of the Huangpu River, at 121 degrees 29 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 41 minutes 15 seconds north latitude. The distance from the county seat to the confluence of the Huangpu River and the Yangtze River is twelve miles. The Suzhou River (i.e., the Wusong River) passes through the northeast of Shanghai County and joins the Huangpu River. Both of these rivers are transportation rivers connecting Shanghai with counties near Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Shanghai is entirely situated on the alluvial delta formed by the silt of the Yangtze River. The surrounding villages have fertile land suitable for planting rice and cotton.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been a town for at least 2,154 years. Examining the meaning of the character "Hu" (滬), there is an explanation that "arranging bamboo in the sea is called Hu." "Hu" is a tool for catching fish. From this perspective, there is no doubt that Shanghai was originally a fishing market. However, as the coastline extended, Shanghai lost its original essence as a fishing market and developed into a large commercial port. However, Wusong Town, which is closer to the coast, replaced it and became a fishing market. Judging from this, Wusong Town will definitely not be a fishing market a thousand years from now. Perhaps it will become a more prosperous and important commercial port than Shanghai is now. The saying "seas change into mulberry fields, and the affairs of the world are ever-changing" is a perfect description of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, examining the meaning of the two characters "Shanghai" (上海), they are the opposite of "Xia Hai" (下海, going to sea). In the early Yuan Dynasty, there must have been two bays extending into the coast. One of these bays was named "Shanghai" and the other was named "Xia Hai." Shanghai County in the early Yuan Dynasty was located in "Shanghai." As for where "Xia Hai" was located, it is not easy to investigate at the moment and requires further research in the future.</p>
<p>In the thirty-third year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty (1554 AD), pirates and Japanese raiders landed at that time, plundering Zhejiang and coastal areas. The Shanghai County seat was originally built with city walls to defend against pirates. In the third year of Xuantong, after the revolutionary army recovered Shanghai, the city walls were demolished and the moat was filled in. Therefore, people who come to Shanghai for the first time now do not know where the old city of Shanghai was located.</p>
