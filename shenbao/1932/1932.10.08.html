<h3 id="c1">米價與農民之救濟仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>最近米價慘跌。我勞苦之農民將瀕於没落之悲運。此一問題。其　重之程度。實不亞於東北之淪亡或淞滬之遭劫也。</p>
<p>在目前我國輕濟機構之下。其農民之窮乏。本有其先天的成因。随時皆有慘遭敗潰之可能。初固不僅限於「米價慘落」之一現象。故在經濟機構未有轉變以前。即不易澈底掃除農民敗潰之危機。然農民痛苦。逼在眉睫。治標之計。自急於治本。不可不求目前所以救濟之道。</p>
<p>顧米價慘跌之由來。其近因爲本年秋收之豐盈。遠因爲中國内地金融之呆滯又加以去年大批美麥之購入。其影響遂使米價慘跌。甚至如皖省等地。有跌至每石二三元者。蓋秋收豐盈之結果。米之供给量增。其價自落但此時如能因價格之下落。而唤起新的消費量則下落。後之米價。仍不難使其回漲。然而環覩國内現狀匪患猖獗天災頻仍内地資本。已轉　爲通都大埠之遊資。以致金融呆滯。購買力衰頽。欲求新的消费量自不可得。</p>
<p>米價慘跌之結果。農民所受損失。最爲痛切。就吾人可以推知者。一爲收入之鋭减。二爲收支之不平衝。此二種農民之損失中。其前者爲極明顯之事實後者乃因前者損失而起。蓋農民下種時之米價昻。收穫時之米價廉。加之以各種肥料工資及流動費用。均皆增高。其收入實遠不敷於其支出　。至於自作農。則不僅蒙前述二者之損失。而更須負擔一重地價上之損失。蓋米價下落之結果。田價必亦因而下落。無形中所受之損失。亦不資也。</p>
<p>故農民在米價慘跌以　。收入减少而支出如舊。租税不能不缴納生活不</p>
<p>能不維。持結局使向之能耕於田者。歎「樂歲終身苦。凶歲不免於死亡。」或背鄉離井流入都市而爲失業之民。或棄其故業轉輾流爲内地之匪賊。直接簡接使社會陷入於大混亂漩渦之中。因榖賤病農之現象。進而演或農村匪濟之破產。</p>
<p>於今之計。吾人以爲欲維持目前之農村機構則惟有從速救濟農民。最近財政部内政部方面。曾有各種救濟策略。似已對於「榖賤傷農」之现象。亦謀有以緩和之但吾人以下列四點。當局更應加以注意。</p>
<p>（一）限制交易所公定價格今日中國生産。爲不以消费量爲前提之無政府生産故其真正之公定價格。端賴交易所之决定。但交易所中一般投機商人。往往愈小愈抛壓低其價格。故政府當局。應速規定一最低價格。以限制糧食交易所中米價之慘落。</p>
<p>（二）政府收買米榖米價之維持若僅賴限制交易所之公定價格則其收效恐微。故政府於限制市價之外。應再以公定之價格收買米榖。庶使可以真正稳定市價。</p>
<p>以上二點爲僅限於米價之維持。此外關於農民之救濟政府應（三）一定期限内豁免租税使農民之負担减輕。培植其巳失之元氣。（四）低利資金借貸之創設今日中國之農民。巳至山窮水盡之際。政府爲維持其生計及社會安寗計應規定一低利資金貸與法。指定特許銀行或地方政府負責辦理。其資金之利率不得出普通利率百分之五十。</p>
<p>今日中國財政。吾人固深悉其巳逹羅掘俱窮之際。上述四點。除第點不與財政發生關係外。其他三點皆非具有大宗欵項以辦理之不可。惟吾人以爲祇須政府能具有救濟農民之决心與誠意則具有天良之資産者。必僉起而援助之也</p>

<p>華聨社七日東京電　今日内閣會議散會後、荒木陸相曾與三土鐵相另在别室密議、聞荒木懇託三土向高橋財長疏通謂陸軍省新預算達五萬萬一千七百餘萬元、均爲不可缺少之經費、高橋財長堅持發行公債支持、但明年度新預算如全部依靠公債、恐將發生困難、况當此國家非常時期、如全由中産階級以下負擔未免過於失當、軍部深望財部能採取增税政策、使富人階級多負擔點國家之義務、懇託三土鐵相代傅軍部之主張三土答謂、國會日期巳迫在眼前、且高橋財長素不贊成增税、如果合起海軍預算軍費、則將逹十萬萬元、以目前日本財政能力、恐難負擔得起、本人定明日往葉山訪財長、尊意當代爲傅逹、會談一小時始散、</p>
<p>華聨社七日東京電　關於荒木派之增税問題、民政黨内部發生兩種意見、贊同增税者謂、若　内閣末期、因應付財政之不敷、曾有增税計劃、爲改修所得税率·提高資本利息税率·與繼承税等、在理論上民政黨可不必反對、而反對者方面謂、十月以後雖欲準備增税、但在事務上實爲不可能、並且因爲擴大軍備而增税、不但理由不甚好、且將剌戟國際上平和主義者之感情、無論在理論上實際上都不可採取之政策云、</p>

<p>民國以還、學者知合作事業之重要、而最先倡導之者、歐爲香山薛仙舟氏、民七首創平民學社、卽爲我國最早提倡合作之圑體、當時影響所至、風氣爲之一開但因時機未至、遂亦漸作漸輟、迨民十六國府成立、中委李石曾·蔣介石陳果夫·諸氏建議中央、提剏合作、於時合作運動遂爾勃興、一時陳果夫·王世穎·孫壽麟·壽勉成·諸氏、遂有中國合作學社組織、以研究學説·提倡運動·指導設施·調查事業·爲宗旨、於民十七年十二月二十二日成立於上海、迄今四載、不特其本身事業邁進有加、卽全國之合作事業、亦多得該社之提挈、且於剏辦之始、卽編輯合作周刋、附印於上海之民國日報、雖執筆者僅少數社員、然亦引起社會之重視、迨學社成立、又進而編輯義書、然當時社員止二十二人耳、</p>
<p>同時該社又委托留法社員陳仲明君、考察英·法·丹麥·捷克·之四國合作事業、陳君於十八年秋回國、著有歐洲合作事業考察記行世、其時該社已辦月刋初由侯厚培氏主其事、繼由王世頴氏主之、至消息記述、屬之程君靖君、叢書亦陸續出版、至十三種之多、中西合作事業之重要書籍、亦多搜羅　備、蓋自此而國中硏究合作者、遂更有發揮理論與實施之中心、而國内合作運動、步趨總前進之事實、亦因是而得所發展矣</p>
<p>該社近又與各國合作團體、互通聲氣、以資借助、一面並卽由陳君主持調查部事、並實地調查各省農村經濟、及已有組織之合作狀况、以期按步實施、時則蘇浙沓冀等省因各該省府及華洋義振會作經濟上實力之援助、農民亦因有嘗試合作組織者、該社卽先由四省入手調查、時經二載、尚能克如預定之目的、其間陳君冀省之行、與侯哲葬君同道、學社經此理論與事實之有力參證、乃益鋭意進行其事業、十九年十月、召集社員大會於杭州宣布推行中國合作運動方案、計畫　當、惟其中大部分賴於政府之設施年來内憂外患、國家多故、每因延擱、但學社能力所及之部分、則未曾少懈、二十年三月、復剏舉合作社職員訓練班於南京、嚴定入學資格、爲實際之指綬、六個月舉業、其受聘於各處之畢業學員、用者均尚满意焉、</p>
<p>該社復已委托社員蔣輯君爲駐英幹事、以便與國際合作聨盟會及英國合作聨合會、就近聨絡、繼而蘇省農　廳函請該社主持吳縣合作事、業實騐區事、該社乃先推王世頴·陳仲明·與農　廰議定實騐區章程、復推陳仲明·李安·侯厚培·負責該區内合作組織、及業務技衛方面之指導、其時該區主任胡昌齡氏、服務努力、故成積彌復满意二十年秋、學社復設置合作問題討論會、專門研究國内合作實施、随時發生之問題、雖以社員四散、未易集會、但以中國幅員之廣闊、情形之逈異、一切之有待於研究者正多、此種專門集會、實爲必要之設置也、</p>
<p>又該社鑑於我國合作事業之日趨發逹、有組織聨合會、以從事合作貿之必要、故於今秋成立一中國合作批發部、專代各合作社批購質物、或代理合作社販賣産品、俾以此爲初步、而逐步形成正式之合作聨合會、剏辦至今、爲時不多、而營業殊復可觀焉</p>
<p>本年九月、該社以各國之合作事業、可作參證者正多、因又籌欵派社員彭捕拙赴歐洲、擬就前陳仲明未至之各國、如德·比·瑞·意·等國、切實調查、用資借鏡、</p>
<p>至合作事業以外、其社員之活動力、亦殊有可言者、現茲社員遍於南北、凡各省合作事業之行政機關、公共團體多由社員主持之、而社員亦已有二百七十三人、出版物叢書、大者十種、小者十機關、公共團體多由社員主持之、而社員亦已有二百七十三人、出版物對書、大者十種、小者十九種、通俗者四種、月刋亦已出版至第四卷第十期、而專門問題之特出專號者、如合作實施事號、合作立法專號等、大有價値、至最近之農村經濟專號、則專爲討論應付目前之困雖問題、足供國人之借　者也、</p>
<p>論其組織、執委會以下、設宣傳研究調查指導四部（旣又增設總務一部、現任執委七人、候補三人、常務陳果夫·總務侯厚培·宣傳王世穎·研究壽勉成·調查陳仲明·指導張延　·社設現在上濟液水路履水别墅、其批發部則附設於新華信托儲蓄銀行以資便利、且該社已購地於南京、苟得社務發逹、行且自建會所、可計日以待也</p>
<p>學社四年來之鄕過、略如上述要之、會員不多經費不充、而其日夕於合作事業自理想而兒諸賽施、自國外而更及國内、其孟晉實爲可嘉社會民生經濟、爲奠國之本際茲農産凋零、民生盡絶之際、國人之所以期許於該社者甚至尤廣其能積極進行以不負於國人之厚期也、</p>

<h3 id="c248">邦家之望！ <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>在雙十國慶節的前後，特地發表所謂「邦家之望」的談話。</p>
<p>中國目前唯一的希望，就是眞正愛國的靑年！記得相老人，曾在樂善堂，延見中國靑年黨的領袖，曾誠懇底説了一番話</p>
<p>「中國現在的政治舞臺，缺乏眞正的人材；諸位，年富力强，到過國外求學多年，自然觀感的作用，也能知愛國必要！何况諸位又肯虚心問學，實際工作呢！我能説些什麽？愛國本於愛人！略一説明，想能明白。因爲「國」是一個虚名·由於「人與人」合羣而組成；所以人民便是組織國家的基本原子或名份子。</p>
<p>諸位看見同胞的堕落，不忍他再被宰割；號召靑年同志，一致起來救國：這就是博愛救人的精神！此眞所謂「邦國之望！」</p>
<p>以前老大帝國，軍國等專制魔王，坐吃人民的供養不彀，便吃人民的本身！民脂民膏，敲盡吸盞；他們幾家，子女玉帛，爲所欲爲，自禍禍國！請問：諸位執政以後，還仍舊行事否？那時候若便不愛人民不愛國家；這！時候乘早不必幹這政治的勾當罷！</p>
<p>諸位謙躬，請我敎誨；説仍舊要執十幾年前的弟子禮：諸位美德：盛意可佩！我老了，望諸位拿眞愛人的一片好心·努力救國。像「麵酵」便成功！我説得不多一些麵酵，拏來納在三斗麵裏·随即蓬蓬勃都發起來了！十幾萬同志，可佈满全國！愛人的福音如此一貫，愛國的精神並無二致：可愛的靑年牢記着！</p>
<h3 id="c249">重陽的應時話 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 朱戤</p>
<p>登高與送酒</p>
<p>登高從前桓景聽了仙人的指示　　在重陽那天，率着妻孥，登高避災，他們回來的時候，果然廬舍蕩然·雞犬皆死。現在的我國，東北的同胞，在沉淪破碎的河山裏，掙扎着，呻吟着，給敵騎鐵蹄的蹂躪；國内的民衆，内地有共匪的殘殺，邉境有軍閥的火併，徧地災象，到處災民。危險啊！假使再不趕早登高，眞有被災的危險了。莫怪名山頂上，不到重陽，已到處發現了要人的冠蓋</p>
<p>送酒　靖節先生在重陽佳節，坐對黄花，壺無滴酒，在這貧困的環境裏，居然有携酒盈罇的白衣人，前來送酒。這是雪中送炭的勾當，自無怪靖節先生要陶然大醉了。我們東北的義勇軍，爲民族爭光榮，爲國家爭勝利；在鐵蹄下面，輾轉拼命，這是何等地可歌可泣；但他們戰死的，果然屍横沙塲，被俘的，還要遭僞國鍘首的非刑。我想稍有心肝的國人，對於這可敬可愛的義勇軍，難道眼睜睜地瞧着他們和東北河山一起淪亡麽？那麽義勇軍是彈糧均缺乏的，處在何等的堅苦環境裏面。國人們，慷慨些罷！假使你没有忘掉一二八的創痕，還是快學着白衣送酒般的捐些欵項給義勇軍罷，莫等到亡國以後，要捐欵也無欵可捐哩！</p>

<p>没本錢的生意</p>
<p>的確，上海是黄金遍地的世界·元實在馬路上亂滾，有福氣的·都有享受的可能；没福氣的，反而將你老人家的鞋兒刺破了！所以現在許多聞人的從前歷史，很多説出來不大好聽的，因爲他們有鋭敏的腦經，奮鬥的精神，便做了有福氣的幸運者。</p>
<p>可是到了目下，馬路上亂滖的元寳也不很多了，找尋也非常艱難，大家未免要起恐慌。有個朋友對在下説：「現在有一種生意，保你發財，只要僱一</p>
<h3 id="c251">劉海粟先生印象記柳亞子 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>我認識海粟有六年，聽見他的名字，怕還在十年以前吧。一九一四年的模特兒案，最予我以深刻的印象，這是藝術和禮敎的衝突，也就是在東方後進國家作爲新興底資産意識和已經没落而還未剷除凈盡底封建制度的鬥爭。</p>
<p>一九二七年，我在日本東京市外井之頭公園中，第一次遇到了他，却大家都在過着亡命的生涯。這時候的當局者，大概嫌我的思想太左傾了，以爲是有什麽縣疑之類；而對於海粟，却又認爲太右，加以學閥的頭銜。做人是這樣的不容易吧，我們一見面就笑起來。於是談政治，談文學，談到斐倫，談到曼殊，很是津津有味的。酒酣耳熱之餘，我便寫了兩首　體討送給他：</p>
<p>（一）相逢海外不尋常，十載才名各老蒼，一卷斐倫遣集在，断鴻客雁話蘇郎。　　（二）白衣送酒陶元亮，皂帽居夷管幼安，一笑勸君箝口好，人間雞犬盡淮南隔了幾天，又去朝日新聞社參觀他的個展。海粟作品的偉大，是用不着我來介紹的，那一天我所特别注意者，却是他作品上面的題字，從康長素樂任公一直到胡適之，郭沬若，差不多像期開了中國近代的名人錄一般。我最愛的一幅是有沬若題句的，内容眞是氣象萬千。你想把沬若廉悍峭厲的詩筆，來配在海粟雄壯闊大的盡稿上，不集是並世　絶，還算是甚麽呢？這一天的印象，簡直是洋洋乎歡觀止了。</p>
<p>等到我一九二八年還國以復，我和海粟的踪跡便疏闊了。海粟一九二九年赴歐，遍歴法意德比瑞士諸國，到一九三一年，才還到上海來。進三年中的進步，當然更是不可限量，然而他的對人接物，却並没有驕矜之態。一九三二年九月四日，他的侄兒留獅在中華學藝社舉行個屁，我去參觀，他和他的夫人張韵士女士都出來殷勤招待　這種藝衛家　和的態度，是很能取得一般人熱烈底同情的。</p>
<p>現在，市政府要主開他的歐游作品展覽會了。爲了精印園自以誌紀念一起見，粟我寫一篇序言在上面寫序，是説何容易的　事情·何况我對於　術，又是十足的外行。不過我和海粟海外相逢的一段歴史，却是不可磨減值得紀念的，　成這篇印象記，就作爲代序　吧。佛頭　糞之談當然不免，用與不用還聽海粟自已斟酌。</p>
<p>一九三二，九，二七，上海。</p>
<p>個夥計，也毋須多大的生財和裝修。最妙的，那個所僱夥計，既不要薪水，也不要吃飯，又無罷工的危險，天下那有這種好生意啊！」在下聽了，非常納罕。那個朋友説道：「你不要驚異，開佛店不是上海最好的生意麽？」</p>
<p>後來在下仔細想來，這句話一些不錯。上海除了甚麽「下院」「分院」之外，還有許多「佛店」，裏面並不是和尚，尼姑，道士，只供了一個甚麽佛像，！·這便是夥計做了幌子。開佛店的老闆，必有一位師父，甚麽華陀，黄石公，韓湘子，張姑　，曹老爺···之類，師父常常鑽到老闆的肚裏來。治病啦，扶乩啦，看相啦，關亡啦，問吉凶啦，甚至國家大事，中日交涉，也能預言。師父來的時候，老闆呵欠大作，涕泗交流，醜態百出，令人可氣可笑。</p>
<p>亭子間嫂嫂，打輸了花會，無意裏在小菜塲買小菜，聽有人喞喞噥噥地説：曹老爺眞靈吓！昨天説開「鄭必得」，果然不錯，我着了三十塊錢，某路電車裏有兩個人，高談闊論，手舞足蹈地説：XX里X號華陀壇治病眞靈呢！我弟瞎了五年眼，中西醫都治不好，豈知壇上開張藥方，吃了一帖，便瞎眼變做亮眼了。旁邉一人應聲道：對啦！對啦！我生了十年痔瘡，也是華陀祖師醫好的。所以上海的中醫固然靠不住，西醫也靠不住，因爲他們百分之九十九江湖：我們有病，還是去求華陀壇·靠菩薩罷！説得電車裏的乘客，似乎個個都非常默認。在下跳下了車，邉行邉想道：一佛店老闆的宣傳工作，眞令人欽佩咧」　　短訊張枕綠君廢操觚之生涯，從事製造良晨箋，迄十有一載，然其狂草之書法，乃與製　事業並進，茲爲結翰墨緣，凡於雙十節前，向北京路浙江路口良農好友社定製或現購箋封逾十元，優待廉價，並得贈張君狂草五尺聨交易逾三十元，除贈張聨外，更贈程門雪君魏碑五尺聨，外埠展限十天，欲索箋封樣品，去費一角卽得云。</p>
<h3 id="c252">八關郵侶（八） <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>當下二人進了英文衣館，佟一貞仍照常上那八時至十時的衣課，魯伯勤也從旁照料一切。可是兩個人的心情，都被這嚴重的問題纒擾住了。一貞是一顆心亂烘烘的，全不能約束到書本上來，伯勤更是失神失智，連一頓晚飯并未曾吃都忘記掉餓　　散課後，伯勤仍悄悄送一貞到那冷静的衖堂裏：在一桿黯澹的路燈柱下，佟一貞因怏悵悶損了許久，已預備好一些警策的句子，要給　伯勤打一支强心針，服一　與奮劑。　　「明天上萬泉，你一定去嗎」伊立定了問。</p>
<p>「一定去的。」他答。</p>
<p>「那麽，你不必送我了。快回去睡覺，不要多胡思亂想，尤不心深計較利害，天下事决難得有百利而無一弊的：若在大前提上認此事爲可以做，便只管大膽的朝前做去，做到那裏算那裏。你聽信我這句話，明天自會有满意的答復與我，我正很熱烈的期望著呢。「千錘百鋉鐵一般的語句，伊用力的一字字吐出來後，揚長自去。但魯伯勤部還是抑　沈吟的咀嚼著回家，全没有勇士般興奮激昂的氣概</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>第二天，這一對靑年男女的優影，果又在萬泉公園發現了。　　這萬泉公園在藩陽城外東南角上，游人從大南門或大東門出城，都可以逹到那裏。原先名呌萬泉河，幾樹垂楊，一　流水，很有點江南的景緻；後又闢爲公園，添造些小橋曲徑，花圃茅亭，以資點綴，更成了瀋陽唯一的名勝。</p>
<p>那年，辦市政的當局，有意把萬泉整理得更高務潔一些，將北平什刹海式郵些雜陳百虥的擬栅幕帳，悉行驅逐，只准擺些乾淨的茶座：萬泉便另有一番　幽與名　的氣象，專爲文明仕女們的游散娛樂地了。</p>

<p>川省二劉之爭，雖未開幕，但調解恐已無望，據劉文輝説，我服從中央命令，而劉湘亦説，我服從中央命令，但據劉湘代表范崇實説，川事有開戰之可能，更據劉存厚代表余雲　　川戰　不可免，到底兩人服從中央呢，還是不服從中央，旣經服從中央，何以尚欲開戰，既經不服從中央，何以口口聲聲說服從中央呢，</p>
<p>服從中央四個字，的確是一個「劃一不二」「童叟無欺」的金字招牌，店中的貨物如何，可以不論，在弱的一方，靠了服從中央四字的招牌，冀得中央的援助，在强的一方，靠了服從中央四字的招牌，一面可以使中央不好再去援助弱者，一面可以卸却違抗中央命令的罪，同是服從中央命令之中，各有各的心理，各有各的效用，這是近日「陰悖事理陽逃罪責」的一個絶妙方法,</p>
<p>這種方法,如運用得宜,無論何事,均可照此辦理,儘管口口聲聲説「如此這般,」事實上儘可「不如此不這般,」眞所謂「掛了羊頭賣狗肉,」賣到六里是六里,還有什麽道理可請呢,故近日的商店大廉價,大部分是如此,日本之組織僞滿洲國,亦無非用此手段，即一切的做人和做宫的方法，亦無非如此兩魯　　妙不同　　　　　春得賣　，處處可以發現此　現　　　唉！服從中央命令！服從中央命令！天上幾多的罪惡，皆假汝之名以行文藝</p>

<p>上述釉藥成份之化學方式如次··　　三塗釉法，將已燒或未燒之泥坯，藉下列之方法以完成其目的，A，浸漬法，將上釉之物，在適當稠度之釉藥中浸漬之即成，B，流注法，將釉藥流注在須上釉之器皿上，C，塗擦法，用毛刷等類之物件，將釉藥塗刷於器皿之上，D，氣壓法，此法爲目下最流行之方法，不但工作可以敏捷，而所上之釉，可使之厚薄均匀，其法藉氣之壓力，將釉藥由極細之孔中推出，當出口之後，成爲烟霧狀而着器皿，E，揮發法，此法藉食鹽，金屬與蒸氣之作用而成，即食鹽與水蒸氣之作用，分解而爲曹逹與鹽酸，其反應如下式，</p>
<p>2NaC1+H20=Na20+2HC1如此水蒸氣與鹽酸各自逃散，而所餘之曹逹，則與泥坯中之硅酸化合，猶是器皿上一層光亮之鹽釉發生矣，</p>
<p>最後我人不得不注意泥坯與釉藥之伸縮力是否一致，如不一致，則所塗之釉必受膨脹或收縮而燥裂，釉藥之伸縮力若較泥坯爲大，則必須减少鎌質（AiK　ll）而增硼酸，鎌土類之鹽基硅酸等，蓋各個原料伸縮力之最大者爲鎌質（NA20=100,K20=8.5)(註）最小者硅酸（S102=0.8)(註）是也，</p>

<p>— 慈民</p>
<p>送情問題，老是困厄着我。這幾天，正想提出意見在本刋上和大家計論個改良的辦法，不料子才君的木大作，先我而投登本刋，眞可謂「深合我心」了。　　人是富有感情的動物，所以相互間的交際，往往事不了一個「情」。親戚朋友有喜事或喪脱，就需要向對方表示慶賀或弔唁的「情」。但是「情」，原是一種内心的精神作用，要怎樣才能表示我這個「情」，要怎樣才能使親戚朋友，感應或接受我向他表示的「情」，大家覺得單靠「情」的本身去實踐這個任務，有些困難，於是便産生了用有形的物質的饋贈，來表示「情」的「禮物」。是以子才君所説的送情問題，在目前，顯然已變式而成爲「送禮（物）問題」了。</p>
<p>「千里送鴻毛，禮輕情意重」。可知道禮物的多寡，决不是衡量情意輕重標尺，子才君説：「不過表示情意，隆重大可不必，」這話着實不錯可是，在這精神與物質分了家的社會，一般人都信奉着極端的「拜物敎」的資本主義社會，「禮」與「情」中間的連瑣關係，在許多塲台，每每是被折斷了的。送禮物的現象，可不必導源於「情」，而不妨「無故饋人，」用以逹到某種目的：反之，有「情」的關係的雙方，毎因爲「勢利之鞭」所驅斥，未必就伴隨着一個送禮現象。此類例證甚多，用不到我一一贅述。現在，姑且把這種反常的事實劈開，來談我改良本問題的管窺之見，我除贊同子才君的意見外，覺得有二點應該補充：　　一，送情以情的疏密爲準則譬如我的多年的老師死了，他的家屬，即使不發訃告給我，我也應該送情，表示我沈痛哀悼之思。又譬如我的老師的祖父母或父母死了，即使發訃告給我，我儘可不必送情，因爲我與若輩之間，原無「情」之可言。</p>
<p>二，减少送情的事件婚，嫁，喪，葬，乃人生大事，爲慶賀而送情，爲弔唁而送情，是應該的。但試看目下社會上送情的事件，眞是五花八門，紛紜繁複，什麽新屋落成啦！什麽兒子生日啦！還有什麽····啦！層層節節，愈來愈多，要是都要送情，豈不閙死了我輩窮錯大！為一般民眾着想，减少送情事件，更其應該。</p>
<p>子才君以爲如何？讀者諸君，以爲如何？</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>—拍賣　中的顧客們聽者—</p>
<p>生活永遠那麽乾澀乏味，談不到絲毫發展，心頭已夠十足煩悶為了想透透新的空氣，午飯用過，便跳出樊籠似的亭子間，慢慢地踱到了富有廣東氣味的北四川路北，使我頓時聨想到日帝國主義者鐵蹄下的東北，韓劉火併下的北方民衆，而且彷彿「外患内憂」的序幕，一一展映在我的眼前。脚跟停住了，已到了海寗路口的書攤旁，張眼一望，竟發見一本「五卅特刋」的東方雑誌，我信口向那行販</p>
<p>「這個幾鈿」？</p>
<p>「四角大洋」！</p>
<p>「兩隻角子好弗哪」？</p>
<p>「弗可以，規規矩矩四角小洋鈿」！　　其實就是兩隻角子，我也一時拿不出來，於是我只略略借看了内容便離開了，前行數步，便是頂有牛皮的虹口大旅社，那已是鐵門重鎖，屋内的斷磗瓦礫，破碎玻璃之類，東一堆，西一堆，一塌糊塗，我曾憶起，兩年以前去那兒會訪一個朋友，因爲衣服紥得太蹩脚，司閽老是兩眼掠着我，意思不外是：「你這人，不是乞丐，也定是扒手！」眞使我宿恨猶濃，看了它如今的浩刦，可眞心快！然而一轉念到日兵的横暴，終於我的私怨私仇被壓服了。</p>
<p>又慢慢兒踱，前面一陳陳送來慣例的減價削價大拍賣的鼓樂聲，原來就在轉角的某某公司樓上，門口頭人山人海，擠得水洩不通，我爲了觀光心的驅策，也碰命地去擠，擠進門檻，最先發見的是貼在一方大玻璃上的「當心扒手」四個大字，信手摸摸自已口袋裏的鋼筆幸虧還在，於是放心巡禮：那眞是大拍賣，禮帽，衣料，絲襪，化妆品，一切的一切，都很便宜，可惜我的袋裏「室如懸罄」只有觀觀光，看看别人家在東捒西擇，兩手不空。一個拖着長辫子的廣東阿姊，兩角小洋買了一瓶先施千里香，一角買了一瓶三星牌花露水，還買了四角洋鈿一雙的長統絲襪兩雙，眼迷迷地拏着走了，還有一個大腹便便袖子長得特别的一位白相朋友，一隻洋買了一個原價四元的禮帽，順手便戴在頭上。還有，交關人，總是來時手空，出門满載，眞是難得的便宜機會。只是那些貨物都玷有泥灰，而且折皺，原來那是「一二八」禍變的時候，搶前把它搬出來的，所以弄成那樣！髒而且皺，所以才便宜把它拍賣。</p>
<p>我想只要稍有血性的人，誰都會辨清那些貨物並没有泥灰，也不是折皺全是我們同胞的淚痕，十九路軍士兵的殷血！一個個顧客買得了便宜貨，該當知道這是「一二八」日兵的賜予！我們應該怎樣去感謝它！報答它呵！</p>

<p>— 人</p>
<p>這樣一個悲慘悽痛的國難當前的年頭，無論是青年，是老年，誰都應當慷慨激昻，燃燒着沸腾着熱血，擎槍，上剌刀：衝鋒，殱敵人！因爲，中華，　我們的祖國喲！誰願意眼巴巴的瞒着他的燦爛可愛的祖國沉淪和滅亡呀？</p>
<p>是嗎？中華的國民都這般雄偉的懷抱和堅苦的意志嗎？朋友！慢着吧，請讓我告訴你一叚在國難日所碰着的沉痛的悲哀的而令人眦裂髮指的事！</p>
<p>一條滬西寛闊的馬路旁，巍峻地蜸起一座莊嚴而雄偉的X敎堂。這天，正是他們敎徒在做禮拜祈禱的聚會。A從校裏赴了紀念會回來，要我陪他去參觀敎堂裏紀念國難的空氣。</p>
<p>四條腿踏上台階，屋裏閃出一個黄髮碧眼兒向我們歡迎示意，又殷殷招待，於是我們就入了最後的一排座，會堂裏分左右兩邉坐着四五百男女，有摩登的靑年，小姐也有鄕氣土味的村男，老婆婆。但是裏面的空氣，是始終十分沉静而充满了莊肅和嚴威。</p>
<p>「國難當頭，我們需要戰！」一個西裝的靑年牧師立在講台上舞手畫脚的在講他的（道），「但是，當你在準備戰的時候，第一，你常常想到聖靈與你同在；第二，你要背起耶穌的十字架；第三你應當拿着主的蜜例　　那末，你</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>戰必勝，敵的砲火和血肉必望而披靡因爲，你的戰，是我們的主在爲你作戰，我們的主是何等尊貴偉大，有權威而愛護我們！我們應當感謝我們的主，並求他永遠與我們同在，我們的國家便自然會榮茂興强起來·····</p>
<p>屏息静氣如坐針氈上差不多快要窒塞而死了，然仍忍心耐意地繼續二小時聽這所謂（道）·末了·在外國人的笑臉的歡送中，我們一溜烟逃出馬路，深深地吸了一口新鲜空氣，好像囚犯奉了大赦的恩典，得重見天日一般！</p>
<p>「他媽的，眞是耶穌自有道理！A」</p>
<p>苦着臉自言。接着·他緊揑着雙拳悲憤激昻地狂呼：「洋奴·走狗，該死的東西！麻醉人生的巨魅，血冰了的活尸！難得他還曉得「國雖當頭」，難得他還曉得「我們需要戰」，然而聖靈，寳劍十字架····一遍鬼談怪話，萝言囈語，我們的國家便自然會榮茂興强起來嗎？敵人的砲火血肉眞會望風披靡嗎？主是甚麽東西？牠能爲我們作戰嗎？····朋友，被麻醉了的朋友喲！淸醒吧，别再迷戀着烏有的「上帝的權威」，請放棄你的狹義的個人英雄主義，讓我們團結我們的羣衆，集中大衆的力量，燃燒着沸腾着我們的血，擎槍，上剌刀；衝鋒，殲仇敵！殺，朋友，殺！殺呀！戰啊！中華，中華是我們的祖國喲！」</p>

<p>五個不敢當的先生孟堅　　先生是個普通的稱呼，誰都是敢當的；但是下面的五個先生，是有人不敢當的。以先生而有人不敢當：所以我就説他們是五個不敢當的先生</p>
<p>（一）大人先生宗法社會的傳統思想，這個先生是誰都願做的：但是因爲大人先生每每做不好事，所以就有人不敢當了。其實是並不是不敢當，實在是當不好，當不長，在辭職書上表示出不敢當的。</p>
<p>（二）南郭先生南郭先生　　　充數的，在實際上敢當的多：而在表面人便没人敢當了。所以現在是指爲南郭先生的，便不敢當，而得爲南郭先生的，便是幸運，</p>
<p>（三）小先生，小先生是雛妓的别名，當到他就是走入火炕的第一步，成爲男人們的玩物，變爲社會的下流，簡直成爲一個無自由者。做小先生的，本無所謂敢當，完全是年幼無知，被人陷害的。假使他稍有理性·稍有生活技能，並能逃脱好人的束縛，我想他一定是不敢當的。</p>
<p>（四）郭先生這個先生是可以稱姓郭的：但是姓郭的聽了要發氣，以爲這是一種侮辱，是不敢當的，</p>
<p>（五）白字先生白字先生，小的時候，誰都是當過的：但是到了大的時候，不敢當了，因爲當了是怕難爲情的。現在白字先生很多，究竟如何的敢當，等我下一次再話吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rice Prices and the Relief of Farmers <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have plummeted drastically. Our hardworking farmers are on the verge of a tragic downfall. The severity of this issue is truly no less than the loss of the Northeast or the devastation of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Under the current economic structure of our country, the poverty of farmers has inherent causes, with the constant potential for disastrous collapse. Initially, this is not limited to the single phenomenon of "drastic fall in rice prices." Therefore, before the economic structure is transformed, it will not be easy to thoroughly eliminate the crisis of farmer ruin. However, farmer suffering is imminent. Measures to alleviate the symptoms are more urgent than addressing the root causes. We must seek ways to provide immediate relief.</p>
<p>Considering the origins of the drastic drop in rice prices, the immediate cause is the abundant autumn harvest this year. The distant cause is the stagnation of finance in the Chinese interior, coupled with the large-scale purchase of American wheat last year. The impact has led to a drastic fall in rice prices, even to as low as two or three yuan per stone in provinces such as Anhui. The abundant autumn harvest has resulted in an increase in the supply of rice, and its price naturally falls. However, if the fall in price could stimulate new consumption, then the subsequent rice price would not be difficult to recover. However, looking at the current state of the country, banditry is rampant, natural disasters are frequent, and inland capital has been transformed into floating capital in major port cities, leading to financial stagnation and a decline in purchasing power. It is impossible to seek new consumption.</p>
<p>As a result of the drastic fall in rice prices, farmers suffer the most severely. What we can infer includes: first, a sharp reduction in income; and second, an imbalance between income and expenditure. Among these two types of losses for farmers, the former is an extremely obvious fact, while the latter arises from the former. The price of rice is high when farmers sow their seeds, but the price of rice is low when they harvest. Adding the increased costs of various fertilizers, labor, and operating expenses, their income is far from sufficient to cover their expenditure. As for owner-farmers, they not only suffer the aforementioned two types of losses but also bear an additional loss on land value. As a result of the fall in rice prices, land prices are bound to fall as well, resulting in intangible losses that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Therefore, because of the drastic fall in rice prices, farmers experience reduced income while expenditure remains the same. Taxes cannot but be paid, and life cannot but be sustained. The result is that those who were able to till the land sigh, "A good year brings lifelong hardship; a bad year brings inevitable death." Or they leave their hometowns and enter the cities as unemployed people, or abandon their original occupations and turn into bandits in the interior. Directly and indirectly, this plunges society into a vortex of great chaos. The phenomenon of grain cheapening and harming farmers further evolves into the bankruptcy of rural areas and banditry.</p>
<p>In today's situation, we believe that to maintain the current rural structure, the only way is to promptly provide relief to farmers. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior have had various relief strategies, seemingly intending to alleviate the phenomenon of "cheap grain harming farmers." However, we believe that the authorities should pay more attention to the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Restricting fixed prices in the exchange. Today, China's production is non-governmental production without consumption. Therefore, the true fixed price depends on the decision of the exchange. However, speculative merchants in the exchange often sell and depress the price more when it is lower. Therefore, the government authorities should quickly stipulate a minimum price to restrict the drastic fall in rice prices in the food exchange.</p>
<p>(2) Government purchase of rice. If the maintenance of rice prices relies solely on restricting the fixed prices in the exchange, the effect will be minimal. Therefore, in addition to restricting market prices, the government should also purchase rice at a fixed price to truly stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>The above two points are limited to the maintenance of rice prices. In addition to this, regarding the relief of farmers, the government should (3) exempt taxes within a certain period to reduce the burden on farmers and cultivate their lost vitality. (4) Establishing low-interest loans. Today, Chinese farmers have reached a dead end. For the sake of maintaining their livelihoods and social stability, the government should stipulate a low-interest loan law, designating licensed banks or local governments to be responsible for handling it. The interest rate on these funds should not exceed 50% of the normal interest rate.</p>
<p>Today, we deeply understand that China's finances have reached the point of exhaustion. Of the above four points, except for the first point, which is not related to finance, the other three points cannot be implemented without a large sum of money. However, we believe that as long as the government has the determination and sincerity to provide relief to farmers, landowners with conscience will surely rise up and assist them.</p>

For days, aircraft have been circling Shenyang, Liaoyang, Benxi, Fushun, Tieling, Faku, Xinmin, Liaozhong, and other places for reconnaissance. Bombs have been dropped everywhere on the Righteous Army's positions, and leaflets have been scattered to advise the Righteous Army.

<p>(Nanjing) The central government intends to simply send commissioners to Sichuan for mediation. Shi Qingyang, Zhang Hua, and Dai Fuxian are now being considered. Shi and Zhang both declined modestly. Zheng Xiang is asking Dai for his agreement. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th discussed the Sichuan matter and He Yingqin reported on the situation of summoning Sichuan representatives for talks.

<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang hosted a banquet for the members of the Mongolian-Tibetan Association on the 7th to exchange ideas on eliminating the Sichuan war and maintaining various defensive measures. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing office of the Twenty-Fourth Army issued Liu Wenhui's telegram to Jiang stating, "Recently, I received your telegram, which reveals the advantages and disadvantages and expresses the hope for peace, as if shedding tears while speaking. If not for wood or stone, how could one not be moved? The Sichuan matter cannot be implemented by force, and one cannot simply seek local convenience and take direct action. Your Highness's brilliance and insight, which illuminate even the most hidden places, are especially evident. Wenhui's conscience has not been lost, and the great righteousness is clear. At this time of national crisis and survival, Hui also bears the responsibility of half of the Western Defense. He dares to offend the Unworthy and abandon the people of the country. Therefore, the roads are chaotic, and it is said that it will be unfavorable to our side. Without reason, soldiers robbed. It is unknown what name the army is under. I have ordered my troops to strictly guard the original defense, and I have also asked the travelers to ask for instructions on how to proceed or stop. On the 2nd, Chen, the Deputy Division Commander of the unit stationed in Shunqing, reported that on the night of the 1st, suddenly a large number of teams were firing across the river at our Liddu, I电 told after the day on the 3rd, and also asked to ask for your careful examination and strict order to close it. On the 4th, it was further reported that Luo Hunzhou, Li Jiayu, and other troops were actively advancing towards Shunqing, and they were not far away. The trigger was about to go off. It was also confirmed by various telegrams and facts that the counties in the 21st Army defense area, such as Jiangjin, Yongchuan, Tongnan, and Dazubeilian, had also increased their troops and deployed defenses, and various preparations for war were even more unpredictable. For many years, Wenhui's national righteousness has not changed, and he has never hesitated to be humble. However, it is difficult to be sincere, and it will eventually lead to the sibling fight, and the useful army will be able to fight in the Central Plains and work for the country. The mere intention is to turn around and fight for the interests of the barbaric corners. It is really infinitely touched, and I can't help but know that my tears and tears are vertical and horizontal. Only the Li Luoshao and Zheng's troops have opened up the situation, and there is no blame for resigning. Wenhui should follow the instructions of his Highness and add to the trial. In the meantime, the hidden dangers are great, and it is inevitable that many things will be involved. At this time, when the arrows are drawn and the strings are controlled, it is really a dangerous moment. Your Highness admires peace and laments internal wars. How should you immediately stop it and deal with the source of the disaster? You must have a way to secure Sichuan to secure the overall situation. Wenhui is righteous and obedient, and he has no other plans. The unfinished fingers are uniformly tolerated. I will tell you in another report. The proximity of the telegram is extremely respectful. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official received a telegram from Chengdu stating that on the night of the 1st, many troops suddenly fired across the river at the troops of the 24th Army stationed in Shunqing. The army did not return fire. It stopped the next morning. Another telegram stated that after Li Jiayu returned to defend, his troops had now advanced to Yuxi, 45 li away from Shunqing, actively provoking and creating a dangerous situation.

Recently, he has levied more than 30 million yuan in national defense donations. The gentry and chamber have fled. Tian Songyao and Liu Wenhui have a bad relationship. They are preparing for street fighting in Chengdu. Deng Xihou is pretending to maintain neutrality and hopes to reap the benefits. The divisions of Chen Hongwen and Chen Xunong of Liu Wenhui's unit fiercely attacked Luo Zezhou's defense area in Wusheng on the 5th. Luo retreated. When he sent a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Commission, he pleaded for a stop and asked Liu Xiang for help. Tang Anyang Sen and Li Jiayu did not produce what Liu Wenhui did. They will unite to fight Liu. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

All those who have held important pseudo-alliances, have committed serious crimes, have been deeply red, are not easy to be influenced, and whose crimes are obvious, have been accused of being factual, and have been identified by a majority of the people as having historically been bandits with evidence, shall be shot on the spot by the army commander who originally captured them after the trial. 2. Among the captured bandits, those who are willing to reform themselves and are guaranteed by more than three of their parents, brothers, or impartial gentry, and who are indeed forced to follow orders, may be examined and certified by the original army commander who captured them, and sent to the county magistrate for supervision and placement. 3. Among the captured bandits, those who are willing to reform themselves and have no guarantee from their parents, brothers, clansmen, or gentry, may be examined and approved by the original army commander who captured them, depending on the situation and the number of people. They shall be formed into small teams, submitted for verification and approval, and assigned to other areas in the rear to serve as hired laborers. Furthermore, each bandit suppression unit shall be ordered that if there is a vacancy, they shall not be recruited or supplemented in the bandit area. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Feng Yuxiang Went North From Tai'an Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e23">### Will Reside in Xuanhua for a Long Time <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) At zero hours this morning, Feng Yuxiang dismounted from Mount Tai and boarded the train. Because the Tai'an Church was sending off Li Dequan, the train was delayed until 5:05 before departing. He arrived in Ji'nan at 7:30, and turned to the main people to greet him at the station. The station's military guard was prepared. After the car stopped, he boarded the car again. Feng was still wearing the small blue cloth cotton-padded jacket and trousers from last winter, tied his legs, wore blue cloth socks and black cloth shoes, and had a ruddy complexion. He no longer had a sick look. At eight o'clock, Han got out of the car, and the car drove north. Feng sent him to the car door, but did not get out of the car, only nodded to the people under the car as a salute. His sons and daughters, as well as the guards and wounded soldiers, all followed. No one was left behind in Mount Tai. Those who traveled with him were Deng Zhexi and Secretary Yu Xinqing, Physician Cai Shanduo, and former subordinates Zhang Yunrong and Han Duofeng. Deng told reporters that Feng's whereabouts were undecided. Han told reporters that because there was something happening in Jiaodong now, foreigners said that he was the instigator. In order to avoid suspicion, he decided to leave Shandong for another reason. Feng told reporters that his departure from Mount Tai this time had no special reason. Because he had been in Mount Tai for a long time, he moved easily to live. Regarding the League of Nations report, he thought that the people of the country had all paid close attention, and he thought that this report completely represented the so-called justice and righteousness of the powers to the sub-colonies. If the people of the country do not think about and work hard from their own unity and resistance, the future will be even more unthinkable. He knew nothing about the Jiaodong war in advance. He was very sorry for the occurrence of this unfortunate event, but the lack of unified administrative power in the provinces of the country and the confrontation between the two forces were the main causes of the continuous civil strife. If this point is not considered a fundamental solution, there will never be a solution. He hoped that the authorities could have a reasonable solution to the Jiaodong issue, and he still advocated recovering the lost territory by force on the issue of anti-Japanese, but only resistance is the only way out for China.

<p>(Nanjing) Ge Jingen, Director of the Aviation Administration, hosted a talk for representatives of various newspapers on the afternoon of the 7th, reporting on his visit to Guling to meet with Chairman Jiang. He undertook to show the direction of aviation development: 1. Rectify the existing equipment and gradually seek its development. 2. Cultivate new talents, develop excellent scientific and technological skills, actively revitalize industry, and expand aircraft manufacturing plants to avoid taking materials from other places for a long time and prevent leakage. 3. The Aviation Administration will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission instead of being transferred by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, in order to facilitate command. 4. In order to make aviation management and aviation education consistent, a part of the staff of the Aviation Administration will be transferred to Hangzhou to work and cooperate with the Aviation School. As for my own opinion, I believe that aviation was originally a sharp weapon for national defense, but it is not necessarily effective if only the aviation aspect is emphasized and other military equipment is ignored. Therefore, the army, navy, and air force must have equal progress, and the situation must be considered, determining which is the main body and which is the auxiliary, so as to meet the needs of national defense. As for patriotic overseas Chinese and people from all provinces who, based on the late Premier's legacy of aviation saving the country, have donated money to purchase aircraft to defend against foreign enemies, their enthusiasm is extremely admirable, but because the types and mechanical structures, as well as the height and speed, are not uniform, it is not only difficult to train, but also has a significant impact on effectiveness during combat. Therefore, the donations should be remitted to the central government, and based on national defense needs, they should be manufactured independently or ordered from abroad, so that the organization can be unified and the combat effectiveness can be strengthened. In addition, I also planned a question of whether aviation materials can save the country, soliciting opinions from all walks of life. All aviation plans can be summarized in it and fully developed for suggestions, so as to be adopted. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) All members of the Supervisory Yuan presented to Yu Youren, stating that since the central government implemented the austerity policy, most agencies have not followed it except for a few that have implemented it. Some pay 40-50% of salaries, some pay 70-80%, and it is even heard that some not only pay full salaries but also monthly allowances, office expenses, and gasoline expenses of several hundred yuan. Now all agencies belong to the central government, and the joys and sorrows are not shared equally. In contrast, it is feared that the personnel of the agencies that comply with the law will have their work efficiency affected due to uneven treatment. The members are responsible for supervision, and they cannot remain silent on this phenomenon. Therefore, they respectfully request that it be forwarded to the Central Political Conference to formulate uniform measures and order all agencies to comply with them uniformly, so that the laws and regulations will not be ignored and all civil servants can be treated equally. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government approved the letter from the Central Political Conference, stating that if the salaries paid by various agencies in the past have not been issued in accordance with the number of civil servants' living expenses decided at the 202nd meeting of the Political Conference, they can be written off uniformly as long as the total expenditure does not exceed 50% of the original budget. If the total expenditure exceeds 50% of the original budget, the National Government shall investigate the situation and handle it appropriately. It has been ordered to the various courts to instruct the various ministries and commissions to comply. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Tang Shaoyi, in his capacity as a member of the Southwest Political Committee, told guests today that he highly approves of Hu Hanmin's criticism of the Lytton Report, pointing out that it is self-contradictory and equal to a waste of paper. It was a big mistake for the central government to rely on the League of Nations instead of invoking the Nine-Power Treaty at the beginning of the dispute. Therefore, he advocates abandoning hope in the League of Nations and focusing all efforts on convening a Nine-Power Conference, because the United States is now paying more attention to the Sino-Japanese dispute. He then mentioned a certain party's suggestion of allying with Russia, saying that it is currently useless to ally with any foreign country. The only way to resolve the dispute now is internal unity, so that we can make a strong resistance. Tang did not say that in terms of the loss of sovereignty, international co-management of the three northeastern provinces would not help China. (7th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Planning to Add 120 New Ships to be Completed in Ten Years</p>
<p>Requiring an Expenditure of $616 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>Far East Agency, Tokyo, 7th: According to a special telegram from the Tokyo correspondent of the New York Asahi Shimbun received in Tokyo, the U.S. Navy authorities will propose to the next Congress the construction of a total of 120 cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and aircraft carriers, with a budget of approximately $616 million US dollars, to be completed within ten years. The expenditure for the proposed 18 ships is $130 million US dollars, and construction will begin soon. It is reported that this proposal had been submitted for discussion in the previous Congress, but at that time, the global situation was not as urgent as it is now, so it was not passed. However, the current U.S. Navy authorities, in view of the increasingly urgent situation in the Pacific, have decided that if they do not expedite the construction of warships, by 1936 the U.S. naval power will be in danger of falling to third place in the world. Therefore, they have decided to do their utmost to ensure its implementation at the next Congress.</p>

Shi Zhaoji, Kong Xiangxi, and Li Jinlun are now in Washington D.C., actively working with the embassy staff.

U.S. officials are unwilling to comment on the activities of these four people in the United States, but it is reported that they are paying close attention.</p>

<p>According to the Asahi Shimbun of September 30th, last year, the political reporters of various news agencies in Washington, under anonymity, jointly compiled a book called "The Washington Merry-Go-Round," which revealed the inside story of the Washington political scene. Recently, a sequel has been published, one section of which emphatically states, "We cannot tolerate the Japanese." The text reads: When the Shanghai Incident broke out, the Japanese troops even advanced into the International Settlement and invaded the U.S. security zone. At that time, Secretary of State Stimson was convinced that war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. His military advisor, Yugen Lejina, also revealed hostility between the United States and Japan. The State Department had consulted with the British on an economic embargo against Japan. Fortunately, the Director of Naval Operations, Biera To, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Adam, realized the danger and personally visited Hoover to present their views, stating that it was not appropriate to go to war with Japan, as the U.S. fleet was not prepared for combat, and the Japanese navy could seize the Philippine Islands overnight. The United States would need two years to prepare for war with Japan. The State Department's advocacy of an economic embargo against Japan would inevitably lead to war. At the same time, Army Chief of Staff Harley also expressed sympathy. Therefore, Hoover advised the State Department accordingly, while Biera To eased the various movements of the Shanghai crisis, and on the other hand, communicated with Japanese General Nomura to alleviate the hostility between Japan and the United States. At this time, Stimson wanted to concentrate the entire Atlantic Fleet on the Pacific coast and begin war preparations. However, after Biera To inspected the western coast and conducted a careful investigation, he explained that the expenses were too high, and the naval factories on the west coast did not have the facilities to repair a large number of ships at once. Subsequently, within two weeks, Stimson again requested the entire fleet to concentrate in the Pacific and began measuring the location of the air base on the Aleutian Islands. Later, the Department of Commerce considered it unreasonable, and it was suspended without effect.</p>

<p>Popular Movements Against Imperialism and War, Right-Wing Groups Conspire Assassination</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Japanese Navy has scheduled a fall grand exercise in the Pacific Ocean for nine days starting on October 22nd. On the 31st, it will jointly conduct a land defense exercise with the Army on the Osaka coast. Starting on November 11th, the Army will conduct a grand exercise in Kansai, including Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto, creating an atmosphere of militarism. Because of this, people in various places who oppose militarism have seized the opportunity to stir up trouble, organizing soldiers' propaganda committees and anti-imperialist and anti-war groups, inciting soldiers, agitating workers and peasants, and actively mobilizing under the slogan of opposing war. At the same time, the Shinbu Society, which has the strongest militaristic color, and various fascist groups are also planning to seize the opportunity to assassinate ministers and instigate dictatorial politics, causing unrest in the Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe area, almost entering a state of war. Japanese military police, fearing that things would escalate, have recently imposed martial law in various important locations, arresting anyone who looks suspicious. Furthermore, Minister of Justice Oyama personally went to Osaka today to oversee the martial law in order to prevent any unforeseen events. It is reported that the prisons in the area have long been full, and the cries of the general working masses and small merchants have not ceased for days.</p>
<p>World News Agency reports that, according to the Dongbao newspaper, since the military department announced the special army grand exercise in Osaka this fall, a certain unstable attempt against the plan has recently been discovered. The special high-ranking section of the Osaka Prefecture police arrested a suspect named Ichiji Shigeo, an activist of a certain right-wing group. After interrogation, he confessed that he planned to take advantage of the arrival of government officials in Osaka during this fall exercise to carry out some kind of unstable action. It is said that a considerable number of people are involved in the case, and the special high-ranking section of the Osaka Prefecture police is currently engaged in a major search and arrest operation.</p>

<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Japanese military authorities believe that the key to victory or defeat in wars against Russia and the United States lies in the ability of the air force to control the air.

This spring, they flew directly from the Tachiarai airfield to Taiwan, and this summer, they flew from the Tachikawa airfield to Hokkaido. Their plans are all along these lines. Recently, they decided to have the Sozawa Army Flying School lead a team to fly directly to Shenyang from the Sozawa airfield tomorrow, with Major General Hirose, the principal of the school, serving as the commander. Each team will have three aircraft. The first team will be flown by Lieutenant Okamura, Lieutenant Miki, and Lieutenant Noda.

It is reported that the date has been set for tomorrow, and it will not be changed regardless of wind or rain.</p>

The resolution did not elicit comment from the American political circles. The State Department in Washington has not yet formally endorsed the Lytton Report, nor has it indicated whether the United States will be represented at the Council of the League of Nations when it considers the report.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 6th: Chinese representative Dr. Hu Shize delivered a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly today, proposing a complete ban on the sale of opium except for medicinal and scientific purposes, saying that China enjoys a privilege it does not want, namely, that certain Western countries ban the sale of opium in their own countries, but allow its sale in their colonies, and there are regulations that it can be sold if the purchaser is Chinese. This kind of situation is very objectionable. Why are Chinese alone allowed to buy and smoke opium? China has never asked for this privilege.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 6th: After the Norwegian representative, in the League of Nations Budget Committee, proposed a motion to abolish the four posts of "Deputy Secretary-General," it was finally won by the representatives of the major powers after a long debate today. However, the resolution was actually empty, merely referring the motion to a subcommittee for review in order to shelve it. It can still be raised at any time in the future. The debate lasted for most of the day today. The small countries all supported the motion, while the major powers jointly opposed it. When presenting the motion, Norwegian representative Hanbairo attacked the current system of the League of Nations, criticizing its organization for retaining special rights, being biased and unfair, and only caring about appearances, thus endangering the survival of the League of Nations and diminishing its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Geneva, 6th: The Fourth Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly continued to study the important issue of senior positions in the Secretariat today. Spanish representative Madariaga declared that the Secretariat must eliminate all nationalism and tendencies. He advocated that all staff members, upon taking office, should make the following declaration: "The League of Nations has entrusted me with a position, and I solemnly declare that I am willing to serve the League of Nations with sincerity, diligence, prudence, and conscience, without being threatened by authority or swayed by power." The scope of the discussion was quite broad. The major countries that enjoyed the position of Deputy Secretary-General, namely Germany, Italy, and Japan, advocated maintaining this position, while other countries, such as China, believed that, both economically and politically, the principle of equality among nations should be restored.</p>

<p>Havas Agency, Geneva, 6th: The Sixth Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly, which deals with political issues, began discussing the thorny issue of ethnic minorities this morning. German representative Rosenberg delivered a speech, saying that Secretary-General Drummond's report contained a section specifically on the protection of ethnic minorities, and the German delegation had asked the General Assembly to hand over this section to the Sixth Committee for handling, which shows that Germany has always adhered to its traditional policy, and its concept of protecting ethnic minorities has never changed. Rosenberg continued, "The procedures adopted by the League of Nations and the Council for handling ethnic minority cases are not perfect. In the future, all procedures should be expedited, and all ethnic minorities should be regarded as parties involved in the event of a dispute, and should be entitled to present their views to the League of Nations in the same capacity as the relevant governments. Also, the various issues related to ethnic minorities should be made public as much as possible, because publicity can make the measures adopted more effective." Rosenberg requested that each member of the Council should have the right to ask the Sixth Committee to handle an event before the procedures on the event are completed by the Council. In addition, for the sake of expanding the method of protecting ethnic minorities, Rosenberg proposed the establishment of a permanent body, composed of people with experience in this matter and familiar with it, and not subject to interference from their own governments. This body should be transferred by the various organs of the League of Nations, specialize in ethnic minority issues, and assist the Council and the committees generated by the Council in resolving ethnic minority issues. The Yugoslav representative, Vodic, spoke on behalf of the countries bound by ethnic minority treaties (i.e., the five countries of the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, and Greece), saying that all major countries and the aforementioned countries had concluded treaties on ethnic minorities. According to these treaties, only the League of Nations Council has the right to handle ethnic minority issues. However, for the sake of reconciliation, the above-mentioned countries and other countries with ethnic minorities within their borders often express accommodation and do not strictly implement their treaty obligations. However, this kind of accommodation cannot be extended any further, so any resolution that changes the current obligations and is only related to the countries bound by ethnic minority treaties cannot be accepted by these countries.</p>

<p>Stating that the Convocation Will Not Be Indefinitely Postponed</p>
<p>Only Italy Agrees with the British Proposal, France and Germany Have Not Replied</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: Today's news from Paris said that a certain issue regarding the convocation of the Five-Power Conference to discuss disarmament has now encountered obstacles. The British ambassador to France has informed the French Premier, stating that Britain has decided not to postpone the convocation of this conference indefinitely. Reuters has learned that the British government originally hoped to convene this conference within the next week, but it is taking time to contact other governments, so it has to postpone the meeting. People in Geneva now believe that this kind of conference may not be able to be held after all. However, London has not given up hope. Although France and Germany are strongly opposed, Britain still hopes that this conference can be convened in the end, so that Germany can re-enter the disarmament conference. It is noted that only Italy has agreed to the original British proposal, while France and Germany have not replied. There is talk of inviting the United States to join, but a formal invitation has not been issued. The British government is still consulting with other countries, and if possible, it will eventually convene this conference. Havas Agency, London, 6th: The British Foreign Office said that Italy had replied to the British government, expressing its agreement to the convocation of the Five-Power Conference in London to discuss the issues raised by Germany's demand for equality. There is considerable hope here for the convocation of this conference, but there is great anxiety to receive a reply from France, because it is generally believed that the success or failure of the conference depends on France's reply. However, this conference will not be convened before the start of next week. Since this kind of conference is a preparation for the disarmament conference, if the replies of the countries are as expected and favorable, the date of the meeting of the Presidium of the disarmament conference must be extended. It is also believed here that MacDonald, who was originally scheduled to return to London on October 14th, is now said to be returning to the capital this week, which is a sign of the success of the British proposal.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 6th: Reports indicate that after French Premier Herriot and U.S. representative Davis met tonight, the prospects for the London Five-Power Conference have improved. Davis arrived here this morning from Geneva with U.S. Ambassador Edji. No communique was issued regarding his conversation with the French Premier, but it is believed that Davis persuaded the French Premier not to adhere to his preconceived notions, so that the British plan to convene the conference would not fail. It is also rumored that the French Premier, unwilling to be known as the person who ruined the British plan, has reluctantly accepted White's advice, but has reportedly raised a number of conditions, the contents of which are not yet known. According to someone who is usually reliable, one of the conditions is to invite Poland, the Czech Republic, and Yugoslavia to participate as well.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Germany's response to the British invitation to convene a Five-Power London Conference will be drafted at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. It is reported that the German government will declare that it is willing to participate in the conference if it can first obtain a guarantee that the demand for equality in armaments will be discussed at the conference, and that Germany will not be jointly dealt with by other countries.</p>

<p>Military Expenses Account for a Quarter, Financial Resources Are Exhausted, Raising Funds Is Difficult</p>
<p>Takahashi Advocates Issuing Bonds, Araki Advocates Increasing Taxes</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The new budget for Japan next year, excluding the expenses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which have not yet been submitted, already exceeds 1.2 billion yuan for the new budget of each province. Among them, the expenses for the army and navy are 600 million yuan, which accounts for half of it. According to the opinion of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, none of the new project expenses can be approved except for the fixed amount of military expenses and rural relief expenses. However, the annual recurring expenses require 1.5 billion yuan. If the new project expenses are reduced to 900 million yuan, the entire budget will also exceed 2.4 billion yuan. It can be said that this is an unprecedented budget. It is worth noting how the Ministry of Finance will deal with it on the day that financial resources are exhausted.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: After today's cabinet meeting, Army Minister Araki and Railroad Minister Mitsuchi had a separate closed-door meeting. It is reported that Araki earnestly asked Mitsuchi to get through to Finance Minister Takahashi, saying that the Army Ministry's new budget of more than 517 million yuan is all essential expenses. Finance Minister Takahashi insisted on issuing public bonds to support it, but if the new budget for next year relies entirely on public bonds, it is feared that difficulties will arise. Moreover, in this time of national crisis, it would be unfair if the middle class and below had to bear the entire burden. The military department deeply hopes that the Ministry of Finance can adopt a tax increase policy so that the wealthy class can bear more of the country's obligations. Mitsuchi was asked to convey the military department's views on his behalf. Mitsuchi replied that the date of the Diet session is imminent, and Finance Minister Takahashi is not in favor of increasing taxes. If the army and navy budget military expenses are combined, it will reach one billion yuan. Japan's current financial capacity may not be able to afford it. He will visit the Finance Minister in Hayama tomorrow, and he will convey your wishes on your behalf. The meeting lasted for an hour before it broke up.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Regarding the Araki faction's tax increase issue, two opinions have emerged within the Seiyukai party. Those who agree to the tax increase said that the Inukai cabinet, at the end of its term, had a tax increase plan to cope with the financial deficit, to revise the income tax rate, raise the capital interest tax rate, and inheritance tax. Theoretically, the Seiyukai party does not have to oppose it. Those who oppose it said that although they want to prepare for a tax increase after October, it is actually impossible to do so administratively. Moreover, increasing taxes to expand military preparations is not only not a very good reason, but will also stimulate the emotions of international pacifists. It is a policy that cannot be adopted in theory or in practice.</p>

<p>Bumper Harvest of Rice, the Future of Japanese Rural Villages is Bleak</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Japan's rice crop suffered slightly from wind and water damage, but this year's harvest is still good. However, the future of rice prices is worrying. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the rice harvest this autumn will be 61.56 million koku, an increase of more than 6 million koku compared to last year. Taiwan and Korea are also in good condition. As a result, rice prices are also falling day by day. Although the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to maintain the rice price at 20 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, the government's purchasing power can only maintain 2 million koku. Maintaining the rice price will be difficult to sustain. The future of Japanese rural villages remains bleak.</p>

<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, a large explosion suddenly occurred at the Kawanosishi Mine in Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan. Fires broke out from the eighth pit to the fourteenth pit. For a time, flames shot into the sky. Workers from the thirteenth pit have all been rescued, but they have all suffered severe burns. The lives and deaths of workers in the other pits are unknown. Because the fire is raging, it is difficult to approach and fight the fire. The workers' families cried aloud. The authorities were at a loss what to do. Many workers were killed and injured, and the mine owner also suffered huge losses, but the details have not yet been ascertained.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 6th: Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov suddenly left Geneva some time ago, and his whereabouts were unknown, causing various rumors to spread. According to reports, Litvinov did indeed pass through Berlin yesterday on his way back to Moscow. The Soviet Russian authorities here also stated that there is no immediate plan to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Romania, so the rumors that Li went to Vienna in connection with the Russian-Romanian treaty were actually a misunderstanding. There are even more ridiculous rumors about Li's departure from Geneva, such as one saying that Li's disappearance was actually due to his being kidnapped. This is probably because after Li left Geneva, the Soviet Russian delegation was secretive about his whereabouts, refusing to say a word, or saying that the delegation did not know where Li had gone. This led to the false rumors circulating in the outside world.</p>

<p>A dispatch from London by Reuters on the 7th reports that The Times commented today on the announcement by the Nanking Railway Ministry regarding the local railway bureaus collecting funds to repay the 5% interest on the 1908 and 1910 Tianjin-Pukou Railway foreign debt. The article stated that this news is quite good, as it indicates that the central government has taken note of overdue foreign debts. However, judging from this news, bondholders are still not satisfied. Firstly, the amount that can be collected each year is very small compared to the accumulated debt. Secondly, holders of these bonds have still not obtained the right to use customs duties as collateral. China's refusal to use customs duties to repay the Tianjin-Pukou Railway debt and the Hukuang Railway debt is a clear breach of contract.</p>

Unfortunately, the rocket exploded only fifty feet off the ground, completely shattering the whole apparatus into powder. Mr. 温 (transliteration) had his hopes dashed in an instant. At the time, the main guests were hiding in cellars, and the rest of the audience were outside the field, so no one was injured. The cause of the explosion is believed to be due to the excessive release of the oxygen mixture that powered the rocket.</p>

<h3 id="e92">National Army Captures Yanxia, Defeats Remnants of Bandits in Eastern Hubei, Recovers Lijiaji <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>A correspondent from Hankou reports that after capturing Longgang on the 3rd of this month, the bandit suppression troops in southern Hubei, led by Guo Rudong and Zhang Gang, immediately pursued the bandit lair at Yanxia in victory. The area is surrounded by mountains on all sides, making it even more dangerous than Longgang. The bandits, led by Kong, have been entrenched here for several years. The bandits' arrangements originally placed equal importance on the area and Longgang, with each acting as a horn to the other. Important organizations were divided between the two places. Sanxikou and other locations served as the gateway. To the right of Yanxia was Jin Kangyuan, where the pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Provincial Arsenal was located. On the 3rd of this month, after Guo and Zhang's troops occupied Longgang, they immediately redistributed their forces, with Guo's troops attacking Yanxia and Zhang's troops attacking Jin Kangyuan. Guo's 76th Brigade, led by Ji Hanxun, including the 151st Regiment, 154th Regiment, and the Brigade Headquarters' pistol squad, led by Huang, set out at dawn on the 4th, advancing along Huangqiao, Xinpu, Dawangmiao, and Tangshan, searching as they went. About two thousand bandits, relying on the line of the Lion Rock, Ke Mountain, and 家之 (transliteration), made contact with government troops. In the midst of the battle, over a hundred red flags were discovered near Chengxian, on the right flank of the position, with wild cries resounding throughout the mountains. Brigade Commander Huang immediately ordered Tang 霖 (transliteration), commander of the 151st Regiment, to lead six companies to attack the bandits on the right flank. By 8:00 AM, the bandits began to falter. Seeing Tang's regiment approaching, they fled towards Sheweishan and Liyan. Pursuing troops followed closely, and after passing through Caijialong and Zhongjialong, they fled in disarray towards the Tongbeitoushan area. The brigade completely occupied the bandit lair at Yanxia at 2:00 PM. In this battle, over four hundred Red bandits were killed, over eight hundred were wounded, over forty were captured alive, and a large amount of spoils of war and reactionary documents were seized. Government troops also suffered casualties, with six company commanders killed, over ten wounded, over sixty soldiers killed, and over seventy wounded. When Guo's division attacked Yanxia, Zhang's division sent troops to attack the bandits' right flank via Shiyan, and also sent Zhu's regiment to launch a fierce attack on Jin Kangyuan, while coordinating with Huang's brigade. When Zhu's regiment approached Jin Kangyuan, about three or four hundred bandits guarding the arsenal opened fire fiercely on the regiment. After the regiment divided its forces and launched a brave attack, the bandits suffered heavy losses and fled in different directions towards Dadun and the deep mountains and forests. The unit also recovered Jin Kangyuan. An inspection of the arsenal revealed the words "Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Provincial Arsenal" written in large characters at the entrance. The structure was magnificent and large in scale. In addition to transporting the gun-making machinery back, the various gun, artillery, ammunition, and bomb manufacturing machines were too bulky to transport and were all destroyed, and the factory site was burned to the ground. The remnants of the bandits, having lost their stronghold, fled to the border of Hunan and Jiangxi overnight, hoping to join forces with another group of Kong's bandits. They are currently being pursued and intercepted separately by troops from the three provinces and will soon be completely eliminated. He Chengjun originally planned to depart on the 5th to oversee the suppression, but upon hearing of the recovery of Yanxia, he has cancelled his trip. As for the eastern Hubei area, the situation had previously been tense but has now become peaceful. The bandits who had entrenched themselves in Jinjiazai have disintegrated and fled in two groups. The majority was led by Xu Xiangqian, and a smaller group was led by Cai Shenxi, fleeing towards Huangma and Taihu. Xu is the most fierce bandit leader in the pseudo-Fourth Front Army, and Cai is the successor to Kuang Jixun after his assassination. Combining the remnants of various pseudo-divisions, totaling about tens of thousands, the main force invaded 圑陂 (Tuan Pi) on the 2nd and captured Lijiaji in Huanggang County. Hao Luoling, commander of the 54th Division, received the report and urgently ordered the cavalry company stationed in 圑陂 (Tuan Pi) to hold their ground and wait for reinforcements. He then personally led the entire division, traveling hundreds of miles at night via Xiaojia’ao and Luotian, to intercept the bandits. Upon arriving near 圑陂 (Tuan Pi) on the 3rd, he learned that cavalry company commander Chen Zhong, with a single company, had defended against tens of thousands of bandits. Although the sacrifices were great, 圑陂 (Tuan Pi) was preserved. He then ordered the Guo and Liu brigades to take the lead in the attack, and after fierce hand-to-hand combat, they finally defeated the bandits, killing about several thousand, and seizing countless spoils. Hao, knowing that the bandits had fled northwest, again led his troops in pursuit. On the 5th, they passed through the Xinzhou area, and on the 6th, they recovered Lijiaji, capturing over three thousand prisoners. Many more were killed on the spot. The group of Cai's bandits who fled to Taihu, numbering about seven or eight thousand, fled eastward from Jinjiapu. Division Commander Shangguan Yunxiang immediately led his troops in pursuit, engaging in fierce battles for an entire day in Daxiaowenchong and Hetoup. The bandits dispersed, and it is estimated that over two thousand five hundred bandits were captured, along with over a hundred horses and over three hundred rifles. In addition, the He bandits in central Hubei have suffered repeated losses in the Jing and Zhong counties. Xiao of Chu telegraphed that the remnants are currently in the vicinity of the Dahong Mountain and west of Liu Fangzui. The National Army completed its encirclement on the 5th and will soon annihilate them. It is also rumored that He himself originally fled to Jun County when he fled to Nanzhang, attempting to enter Shaanxi. The bandits in Jing and Zhong may be another group of He's bandits (October 6th).</p>
<h3 id="e93">Chiang Kai-shek Returns to Hankou from Lushan <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Issues Orders and Sample Rural Land Handling Regulations, Orders Hubei, Anhui, and Henan Provinces to Implement Seriously</p>
<p>A correspondent from Hankou reports that after a brief rest in Lushan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has returned to Hankou to oversee the thorough suppression of the Red bandits, the restoration of rural areas, and the stabilization of order. He descended the mountain from Guling on the 5th to Xunyang, and in the evening, he boarded the Yongji warship to travel west. He arrived in Hankou at 9:00 AM on the 6th. His entourage, as well as Mr. Wang Shuhan and Bao Wenbo, also arrived on commercial ships. After landing, Chiang went to the Yihe Village residence to meet with He Chengjun, the director of the Suppression Commission, and inquired about the recent bandit suppression situation. He then met with Liu Quji, the administrative supervisor of the Eighth District, and the newly appointed Mayor of Hankou, Wu Guozhen, as well as the Director of Public Security, Chen Xizeng. It was decided that on the 7th, he would meet with Xu Yuanquan, commander of the Tenth Army, Xia Douyin, chairman of the provincial government, and Li Jue, commander of the 19th Division. Chiang believes that with the Red bandits about to be suppressed, refugees urgently need to be resettled. He also emphasized that the restoration of rural areas should be given special attention. He has specially formulated regulations for handling rural land in the bandit-suppressed areas of various provinces, which have been promulgated and implemented. On the 6th, he issued instructions to the governments of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces to be informed and to act accordingly. The original order is as follows:</p>
<p>"Land is the source of food for the people and the mother of wealth. The importance of production tools is recorded in historical records. Throughout Chinese history, dynastic changes and great turmoil have invariably originated from the decline of rural areas and the desolation of fields. Since the Red bandits have run rampant, they have used the destruction of rural areas as a means of eliminating the nation, nominally dividing land but actually neglecting cultivation. This has led to frequent famines and widespread poverty. The situation is particularly dire in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Now that the officers and soldiers have bravely suppressed the bandits, refugees everywhere are urgently awaiting resettlement. This Commander-in-Chief feels deeply concerned and cannot bear to perpetuate the remnants of the land division, making innocent people suffer the sacrifices of the Red scourge. Nor is it desired to gain the sympathy of rich farmers, giving assets special protection. People of all levels in rural areas, regardless of wealth, intelligence, or ignorance, should be brought into order, so that there is an adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies, and no conflicts of interest. Based on this principle, the regulations for handling rural land in the bandit-suppressed areas of various provinces are formulated, promulgated, and implemented. To revitalize agriculture and promote agricultural development, the establishment of cooperatives is fundamentally important. However, in the aftermath of great chaos, there is a division between the flourishing and the withered, and different aspirations. Simple organization is needed to meet urgent needs, and subtle insight is needed to achieve impartial investigation. Before rural cooperatives are established, a rural revitalization committee should be established as an organization for transitional handling. Hence, there is the first chapter of regulations. Article 7 of China's Land Law recognizes private land ownership. The Premier advocated for a slight land value tax, also taking recognition of private land ownership as a prerequisite. Therefore, for land that has been dispersed by bandits, if there are deeds and boundaries, the deeds will be submitted for review. If there are no deeds but there are boundaries, certificates will be submitted for review. Once completed, the land will be returned to the original owner, which is not only in line with national conditions but also deeply in accordance with the principles of the Party. Hence, there is the second chapter of regulations. If boundaries have been destroyed, the land has lost its original form, and deeds are lost and difficult to find, this kind of dispute cannot be resolved by the methods of the previous chapter. Therefore, adopting the spirit of land consolidation laws of various countries, a meeting of landowners is convened for public review, and the intention of exchanging cultivated land is implied in the resolution of disputes. Hence, there is the third chapter of regulations. All land whose ownership has not been determined or that is ownerless will be managed and allocated by the Rural Revitalization Committee for cultivation. However, owner-farmers and landlords, as well as various types of agricultural laborers, should each be granted a certain amount of land based on population. What procedures should be followed? After landowners recover their managed properties, can they change or restore tenant farmers? There should be clear standards set. Hence, there is the fourth chapter of regulations. Resettling refugees starts with protecting tenant farmers and hired laborers. The legislative examples of various modern countries all regard reducing land rents, securing tenancy rights, and implementing a compensation system as the three key factors in protecting tenant farmers. If any of these three factors is missing, the goal of protection cannot be achieved. Hence, there is the fifth chapter of regulations. The theory of limiting land ownership originated with Dong Zhongshu in the Western Han dynasty and was further developed by Jia Sidao in the Southern Song dynasty. The method was relatively complete. China's Land Law also has provisions for limiting the maximum amount of land ownership. Today, collecting income tax according to Guohuai's method, compared to the system of land fees being nationalized and redistributed in various countries, although there is a distinction between gradual and rapid progress, they are both social policies. To increase the wealth of the many by benefiting the few, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions. Hence, there is the sixth chapter of regulations. Relieving farmers' debts must be supported by promoting rural cooperatives and farmers' banks, with credit cooperatives being particularly necessary. At a time when finances are depleted, raising funds is extremely difficult. Now, the agricultural products, land rents, wages, and rents from public land, managed by the Rural Revitalization Committee, as well as the income tax collected under the progressive system, are stored and loaned to various cooperatives to be used for financing agriculture. That is, what is taken from the rural areas is still returned to the rural public. Hence, there is the seventh chapter of regulations. Although the Rural Revitalization Committee is a temporary organization, it has great responsibilities and heavy burdens. On the one hand, designated funding should be provided; on the other hand, malpractice should be prevented, so as to avoid long-term neglect and hinder the formation of rural cooperatives. Hence, there is the eighth chapter of regulations. If the above-mentioned measures are only implemented in the bandit-affected counties, the scope would be too narrow and the results would be difficult to achieve. For a more comprehensive approach, in order to ensure the soundness of the rural economy and prevent the incitement of the Red bandits, rural committees should also be organized and promoted separately in counties that have not been affected by banditry, but the term "revitalization" should not be used to show the distinction. Hence, there are the provisions in Article 6, Article 47, Article 51, and Article 59. In summary, the second and third chapters are designed to protect landlords and owner-farmers, the fifth and seventh chapters are designed to protect tenant farmers and hired laborers, the fourth and sixth chapters are the linchpin for harmonizing the interests of all levels, and the first and eighth chapters are the mechanisms and effects for advancing the linchpin. If the provisions of these regulations are fully implemented, the land in each rural area will gradually be managed by rural cooperatives, and all members of the cooperatives will be users of the land, without the distinction between landlords, owner-farmers, tenant farmers, and hired laborers. Then, the Premier's proposition of 'those who till the land shall own it' will not be difficult to gradually realize, and the methods of thoroughly improving agriculture will also be effectively implemented. This Commander-in-Chief has high hopes and hereby orders the provincial government to take note and comply, and to instruct its subordinates to comply as well (October 6th)."</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Miserable Situation in Laizhou, Under Siege <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A correspondent from Jinan reports that Laizhou is currently surrounded on three sides by provincial troops. Liu's army is desperately defending the city, and they have been in a stalemate for many days. The suffering of the people in the city from the ravages of war is beyond description. Mr. 某 (transliteration), the stationmaster of the Laizhou station on the Jiaolai highway, escaped with his wife and children on the 29th of last month. According to him, the situation inside the city is beyond recovery. In order to win over his subordinates, Liu Zhennian ordered soldiers to go out of the city in shifts to confront the enemy. Those who remain in the city act as they please. Currently, the doors and windows of the people have been dismantled by the troops for building fortifications. Every household is left open, allowing soldiers to enter and exit freely, take property at will, and rape women at will. This coming and going is almost like a revolving lantern. As a result, countless women have drowned themselves in wells or hanged themselves. From 南門里 (South Gate) to the intersection, the houses have been burned and bombed completely. He was fortunate to be acquainted with a regimental attachment and begged in every possible way before being allowed to escape. Each person was only allowed to wear a single layer of clothing; all other items were forbidden to be taken out. If the war continues to be prolonged, it is feared that there will be no survivors left among the people of Laizhou.</p>
<p>According to a Mr. 某 (transliteration) in the education field who escaped, Liu Zhennian has recently been very active in training his troops and preparing military supplies and food. For several days before the outbreak of the war, he frequently mobilized troops. At first, people did not pay much attention, but on September 18th, the city was filled with armed soldiers patrolling back and forth, paying close attention to pedestrians. They also frequently went to various agencies and schools, asking about "people sent by the provincial government," and inquired especially diligently about the business tax bureau, asking "Is the director in?" as many as five or six times. Those in the know began to suspect that something was about to happen. Since the outbreak of the war, the entire city has been in a war zone. Schools have been closed and used to billet troops. Various agencies have also been in great disarray, and those who were relocating clogged the roads. Soldiers actively engaged in defensive works, digging trenches, and forcibly removing doors and windows from residents' homes. Merchants' food supplies were completely sealed off and not allowed to be moved without permission. In addition, 40,000 bags of flour were transported into the city from behind the Hai Temple as a plan for prolonged defense. The entire city was under a state of emergency martial law, and all affairs were handled by military orders. The extent of the people's fear can be imagined. Civilian goods were requisitioned, and demands were frequent and urgent. Dong Yushan, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, was forced to jump into a well and died. Currently, the city of Laizhou is packed with troops, numbering no less than ten thousand, completely a military world. Most of the personnel of various agencies have already fled. The director of the postal bureau has also fled to the northern countryside. In the past, mail to Yantai mostly passed through Laizhou by highway, but now it is detoured through Pingdu to Yantai. Recently, the shelling has been intense, and the tall buildings on all four gates have been completely destroyed by fire. Eight or nine out of ten houses in the city have also been demolished, leaving behind a scene of rubble. The essence of the entire city has been almost completely destroyed (October 6th).</p>

<h3 id="e96">Hunan National Martial Arts Examination Situation <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Almost Resulted in a Duel Between the Northern and Southern Factions, the Top Three Were All Students of the Northern Faction</p>
<p>A correspondent from Changsha reports that the second Hunan National Martial Arts Examination established a National Examination Committee two months ago, inviting national martial arts masters and Party, government, and military leaders from both inside and outside the province to serve as committee members. A notice was sent to all counties and cities to send three to five candidates to the province by the end of September. The examination was scheduled to begin on October 1st. A total of 280 instructors and students were sent from various counties and cities, national martial arts training institutes, and technical training brigades. Among them, about fifty or sixty were sent by training institutes and technical teams, and the rest were sent by various counties and cities. The technical team hired Li Lijiug, a famous Taijiquan master from Hebei, as the team leader to teach national martial arts to military officers and soldiers. The training institute hired Wan Laisheng, a famous teacher from the north, as the director. Wan has now left his position and is managed by Gu Ruzhang, who specializes in teaching national martial arts to the general public. Regardless of gender or age, anyone can enroll. Li, Gu, and others teach the Northern Wudang style of long fist, which is very easy to attack with. Most of the national martial artists in Hunan practice the Southern Wu style of short fist, which emphasizes defense. Liu Senyan, a well-known warrior in Hunan Province, wrote to Gu Ruzhang several months ago to arrange a match, but Chairman He stopped it. Half a month before this examination, Gu again wrote to Liu to ask them to compete alone on the first day of the examination. Liu agreed, and the letter contained words such as "I will go even if there are ten thousand people." As a result, the citizens of Changsha were eagerly awaiting the duel between Gu and Liu, which had been brewing for several months, hoping that the victory and defeat of the northern and southern factions could be determined. Unexpectedly, He Jian denied the request, and Liu Senyan was still required to participate in the preliminary examination according to the rules. Liu complied with the order because he still had the opportunity to compete with Gu at the final duel. However, the results of the first two days of the examination showed that the Northern long fist had a significant advantage because it specialized in hitting the opponent's head and eyes and was lively and agile. The Southern short fist, which specialized in defense, was often beaten until its head was bruised and its eyes were swollen. On the second day, when Liu Senyan competed with Ning Desheng, a technical team student who practiced northern fist, Liu initially had the upper hand. Later, due to Liu's carelessness, he was grabbed by Ning, and the two hugged each other and fell to the ground at the same time. Liu was about to rise when the examiner Xin Jianhou (who had won first place in national martial arts in Fengtian) suddenly took advantage of the opportunity to separate the two and punched Liu twice, which angered the audience. They believed that the northerners were helping each other and attacking the southerners. The whole venue was in an uproar, causing a major dispute. Because Xin's attack on Liu was confirmed, He Jian publicly stripped Xin of his uniform, arrested him, and punished him. The storm subsided. However, as a result, Southern masters such as Tang Huidian (who won first place in the national examination last year) were willing to forfeit and refused to appear. A great rift developed between the Northern and Southern factions. On the evening of that day, dozens of people suddenly surrounded Liu's residence, and their intentions were unknown. Liu quietly fled. When the Garrison Command and the Public Security Bureau sent military police to protect him, the crowd had already dispersed. Only one suspect, Liu Fengxiang, was arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. As a result, Liu felt quite threatened. At 4:00 PM the following afternoon, Gu Ruzhang was passing through Fuzheng Street in a car when someone suddenly took his hat and threw it on the ground. The Northern and Southern factions became even more hostile. He Jian heard the report and believed that the original intention of allowing guest instructors to participate in the examination was to unite the various factions from the north and south into one, but it had actually developed into a major duel between the Northern and Southern factions, which was a great loss to the promotion of national martial arts. Therefore, it was decided that starting from the third day, all guest instructors would not be allowed to participate in the examination. Only national martial artists from Hunan were allowed to participate. However, although the instructors of the training institute and the technical brigade were northerners, the students were all from Hunan, so they were still allowed to participate in the test in order to eliminate all disputes. As a result, Liu and Gu had no chance to compete. On the third day of the examination, Liu still appeared and won. The examination period was originally set for three days, but because it could not be completed, it was extended by one day. On the fourth day, the final was held. Liu also appeared twice, first knocking down Wu Shihai and then Wang Shaoyun. This examination had a quota of thirty people, and Liu was recorded within the thirty people. When the final thirty-person final was held, Liu suddenly disappeared. He could not be found everywhere. Until the final four-person final, Liu arrived at the meeting again by car. He Jian felt that he was not following the rules and was very displeased. The audience applauded and welcomed Liu to participate in the examination again; otherwise, they would refund the tickets (because the audience bought tickets to enter the venue, with ticket prices divided into two grades of 50 cents and one yuan). But the opportunity had passed and there was no way to remedy the situation. Liu reported at the entrance of the stage that in order to protect his life, he voluntarily gave up the competition and asked the public to forgive him. At this time, some people advocated arresting him, so Liu immediately left the stage and rushed away after reporting. At this point, the final four-person final was completed and the examination was over. The first four were: first place, Liu Xinquan; second place, Liu Shu; third place, Liu Huizhan; and fourth place, Liu Zaixing. The order of the fifth place and below was determined separately by the committee. It is heard that among the thirty people selected, except for Liu Senyan, who practiced Southern boxing, most were students from national martial arts training institutes and technical brigades. Therefore, this Hunan national martial arts examination saw a complete victory for the Northern boxing (October 5th).</p>
<h3 id="e97">Two Major Libraries in the Jiangsu Provincial Capital <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>"May Third" and "Zhenjiang" are Both Actively Preparing</p>
<p>There are recently two relatively large libraries in the Jiangsu provincial capital that have roughly taken shape and are currently being actively prepared. Their general situations are described below:</p>
<p>The May Third Library is located outside the Ximen of Zhenjiang. The multi-story building began construction in August of last year. However, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, construction was suspended for a long time. Only recently was it completed. The library's expenses totaled more than 20,000 yuan, all from fines from the former Anti-Japanese Association and donated funds raised. About 5,000 types of books have been collected. It is heard that the library will first open the reading room and the research room for issues related to Japan in the near future, and the rest of the departments will be opened gradually. The official opening date will be after all the construction is completed.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Library: After renting the former site of the provincial Party headquarters at Taiping Bridge as the site of the Provincial Zhenjiang Library, the library began renovating the premises, ordering custom furniture, and purchasing books. The renovation project will be completed within a few days. Tables, chairs, bookshelves, and other furniture are also being rushed to completion. For thoroughness, the library sent personnel to visit major libraries in Beijing and Shanghai and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of various equipment plans with experts to choose the best options. For the purchase of books, it is planned to start with social sciences and natural sciences. For old Chinese books, it is planned to obtain them through donations, storage, and exchanges. Currently, more than 3,700 books have been donated from various parties, more than 3,300 have been stored, and more than 180 periodical publications have been ordered. It is estimated that by the end of the first year, the number of Chinese and Western books donated and ordered will reach at least more than 15,000. The education department has approved an appropriation of 40,000 yuan for this year. The library plans to use 30,000 yuan to purchase books and equipment and 10,000 yuan for salaries and operating expenses. If it can be expanded according to plan year by year, it will undoubtedly become a grand spectacle of provincial documentation. The library originally planned to open the newspaper and magazine rooms around the Double Tenth Festival, but in order to enrich the content, it is heard that they will all be opened when the library is officially established.</p>

<p>Accusation Against the Police Chief at Court: Shen Jingxi, the former police chief of this county, had pursued Minister Niu Yongjian for many years. Because of this, he had a deep friendship with Yin Shisheng, a local gentry and fellow student. Recently, due to the robbery case of the Xingye Bank, which was presided over by Mr. Hui, Mr. Yin appealed to the province to issue a letter of instruction, which caused some misunderstanding. Furthermore, the branch chief Shi Wenhuan requested leave of absence, owing more than 400 yuan in unpaid rent. Despite repeated demands, the money had not been paid. Chief Shen presented a petition to the county government, urging a strict investigation and demanding that Shi pay the money. Branch Chief Shi is the younger brother of Madam Yin Shi Yaxiong. Madam Yin claimed that Chief Shen owed Yin 200 yuan from his time in Kunshan, which with interest amounted to 408 yuan. The previous evening, she went to the Public Security Bureau to settle the account. Shen did not acknowledge the interest, leading to a dispute. It almost escalated into a violent clash. Zhu Shikui, an inspector at the bureau, advised Madam Yin to leave. For some unknown reason, she fell to the ground and fainted. Yin Shisheng happened to be in Songjiang due to the Songhu Automobile Company's trial run in Songjiang. Upon hearing of this incident, he telegraphed the county magistrate and the president of the court to come to the bureau to mediate. County Magistrate Shen sent Secretary Tang Zhan Sheng as his representative, and Court President Wang Sixian and others also went to mediate, persuading Madam Shi to return home. It was reported that as Madam Shi was leaving the bureau, Chief Shen wanted to ask Dr. Ding Yu Ting to examine her for injuries, but President Wang and others dissuaded him. The day before yesterday, Madam Shi, with apparent bruising and purple marks on her arm, filed a complaint with the court. Because the procedure was not in accordance, it was transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation. This morning (the 7th) at 10 o'clock, the investigative court was opened. The plaintiff was Yin Shi Yaxiong, the defendant was Shen Jing (represented by Gu Shuxuan). Witnesses County Government Secretary Tang Zhan Sheng, Public Security Bureau Section Chief Yu Shifang, and Accounting Bureau Official Yi Yao, all complied with the summons to appear in court. The judicial medical examiner's results are still pending further verification. This case involves the accusation of a police chief, which has caused an uproar in society. Madam Yin has also alleged that she was humiliated while demanding repayment of debt and that the chief used his power to commit violence, and has telegraphed the provincial offices requesting his removal. Both sides are simultaneously pursuing administrative and judicial avenues. It is expected that their dispute will not be easily resolved in the short term.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Court's Caohejing Prison reported that due to the large number of prisoners, they were unable to accommodate them. They specifically sent a document to consult with the county government, requesting to send a portion of the prisoners to Taicang for detention. They arrived yesterday by train at Anting Station, and were transported by two small boats. There were 70 male prisoners and 30 female prisoners. Prison Official Xia checked and accepted them.</p>

<p>In Yangjia Village, Zhouzhuang, in the county, a bandit boat arrived on the 26th of last month, carrying eight or nine bandits armed with weapons. They broke into the home of villager Tang Ali and robbed him. Before leaving, they kidnapped Tang's wife, Madam Shen, and his nine-year-old second son, Xiao Di. They sent a letter demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan. Because Tang's family was poor, he ignored them. Unexpectedly, the bandit boat suddenly arrived at Yangjia Village again on the evening of the 6th, with the hostages hidden in the cabin. When the bandits went ashore, they were spotted by villagers, who immediately sounded the alarm. The bandits, in a panic, did not have time to return to the boat, and the hostages took the opportunity to sneak ashore, hiding in the rice fields. They safely returned home in the early morning of the 7th.</p>

<p>The case of the unexplained death of Tianzhuang farmer Xu Zhao has been reported by local citizens Yang Zhenmin and Yang Qiyu. As a result, the county government requested the High Court to send a forensic examiner Xuan Fang to Changshu for examination. The bone steaming autopsy was performed on September 17th and 18th. According to the judgment of forensic examiner Xuan, there were no new injuries, and it was determined that she had fallen into the river and died before death. Thereupon the county government immediately detained the original informants Yang Qiyu and others. However, afterwards there were many rumors, saying that this bone steaming autopsy was based on the "Washing Away of Wrongs", and there were many discrepancies. There was also much dissatisfaction with Xuan Fang's judgment. At that time, the entire city was in an uproar, but Yang and others are still detained and have not yet been sentenced. In order to suppress the dissatisfaction outside, Examiner Huang Cheng especially brought Yang and others to court for questioning on the afternoon of the 5th, and informed them that there were many criticisms of this case, and that the entire case file would be transferred to the High Court for review. The remains will be transported to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for re-examination, in order to show great fairness. Yang and others agreed, but requested permission to be released on bail. Examiner Huang Cheng was unable to approve the request before the case was resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Flour Merchants Request Withdrawal of Patrol Boats <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the unified tax in the Republic of China's 17th year (1928), the measures have been changed three times in four years. After the implementation of the new regulations by the unified tax management office last month, patrol boats were re-established at various key points on the river routes, and inspectors were assigned to check passing ships. If there were no sub-transportation documents for cloth, cotton yarn, flour, etc., regardless of retail or wholesale, they were immediately detained. In a few days, Dingsheng, Hengxie, and Taifeng flour mills, as well as Demao Sen cloth store, etc., were fined because they were shipping goods from the flour and yarn factories in this county without sub-transportation documents. These companies have successively sent letters to the Chamber of Commerce, forwarding them to the unified tax office, requesting the repeal of the new regulations. The flour mills in the interior have also stated that the unified tax management office's establishment of patrol boats on the river routes is far more harmful than the previous transit duty stations. Due to the inconvenience of transshipment, the operations of the various mills have been hindered. Maoxin and Jiufeng, among others, have already stopped production. The Flour Mill Association of the interior of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the Shanghai Flour Mill Association, jointly petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the unified tax office to change the new regulations and immediately withdraw the patrol boats, which are essentially a disguised transit duty station, in order to facilitate the transportation of goods and avoid difficulties in the south.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Night Boat from Wuxi to Yuyao Robbed <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Recently, water robbery cases have emerged one after another. According to yesterday's (7th) news, the night boat from Wuxi to Yuyao was robbed again in Wuxi. The boat was moored under the Tonghui bridge in Wuxi. The boat owner's name is Zhou Shifu. There are four shifts leaving at 7 p.m. every day. The previous (6th) day, as usual, the boat left Wuxi for Yuyao. When passing through the Baimu village area, Huangcaodu, approximately 10 p.m., it was suddenly encountered by a pirate boat. More than a dozen pirates jumped out, one pirate held a pistol, and the other pirates held knives and clubs. Speaking in a Northern accent, wearing short clothes and blue cloth on their heads, they ordered the boat to stop. When the boat owner Zhou Shifu saw the situation, he had to stop the boat. The pirates went from boat to boat and beat the crew members arbitrarily. Then, they arbitrarily searched and robbed, totaling a loss of more than 400 yuan. After the pirates obtained their loot, they sped away to the north. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., boat owner Zhou Shifu reported the robbery to the shipping association, which in turn reported it to the county government. At 1 p.m., Section Chief Wang opened a court to question him, and ordered him to return home and wait for the police to be dispatched to investigate and arrest the pirates and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Shao Tang, the eleven-year-old son of Dr. Li Zhongtang, from Deji Street, Liuyu Dai, Shazhou Third District, was kidnapped by bandits on July 27th of this year. Magistrate Ma believed that the incident site was only three li away from the Third District Office and the District Corps, and was particularly close to the Independent Third Brigade. He gave District Chief Zhu Wen and Brigade Leader Liu Xinpei a major demerit. He also tried to strictly order a thorough investigation. In the late last month, the bandits sent a letter from a hotel in Xiaguan, Nanjing, to the victim asking for a ransom of 1,500 yuan. Li Songting went to negotiate and agreed on 1,000 yuan, paying 300 yuan first and the remainder to be paid upon the release of the person. On September 30th, Li Songting went again to pay the ransom when the detectives from the 7th sub-bureau of the Xiaguan Public Security Bureau discovered and arrested the bandits Wang Jinbiao (Wang was an escaped prisoner from the previous year) and Gao Youmin. They immediately telegraphed Magistrate Ma to send a police platoon leader, Cai Jinrong, to Beijing to escort them back.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate transportation between the provincial capital and Jurong, the Jiangsu Construction Department trialed a long-distance bus service on the provincial Jurong road this spring, which was convenient for travelers. However, due to road surface repairs, the service was suspended. Now that the road surface and bridge construction have been completed at the end of September, the provincial government has been petitioned to organize a long-distance bus management office to trial the long-distance bus service. The route starts from Zhongshan in Zhenjiang, passing through Paifang, Qiaojiamen, Xia Xin Dian, Weigang, Dongchang Street, Luoyangguan, Xia Dian, and ends at the East Gate of Jurong, for a total of nine stops and a total length of 43 kilometers. The fare is 3 cents per kilometer (equivalent to 1.8 li). The fare from Zhenjiang to Jurong is 1.29 yuan. It is scheduled to officially open on the 12th of this month. Buses will depart from Zhenjiang and Jurong every day at 8:00 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 3:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The Huai River project started in mid-April. At that time, because the Liang Guanying troops stationed in Jiangbei participated with two brigades of soldiers, the progress of the project was very rapid. Since the Liang troops were ordered to be transferred to Anhui in July, the labor force was lost, and the project was announced to be suspended. Although the project is now being carried out simultaneously into the Yangtze River and into the sea, the funding is still insufficient and the number of hired workers is small. The commander-in-chief of the First Route Army, Chen Diaoyuan, who is currently stationed in Jiangbei, believes that the bandit atmosphere in Jiangbei has gradually subsided, and there is no need for heavy troops to suppress it. He is also willing to allocate two brigades of soldiers to participate in the project. Chen has now reached an agreement with the Huai River Commission in Nanjing, and will continue to follow the previous method. As soon as Chen returns to Pukou from Nanjing, he will send a team to the construction area to work.</p>

<p>The Fourth Water Police District of the province, because bandit boats often appear in the Jianghai waters under its jurisdiction, the original patrol boats and police ships are not enough for patrol. It is now planning to spend 60,000 yuan to increase the number of patrol boats by twenty. Also, the 18th Water Police Team, originally stationed in Nantong, has been ordered by the province to relocate to Haimen, led by Team Leader He Yuanxin.</p>

<p>After the tomb of Xiao Qingwang outside the south gate of this city was excavated, although several accomplices have been captured, a certain Jia from Wenzhou has fled far away with the burial objects and is being strictly pursued. Unexpectedly, the tomb of Wang Nanxi near Zibai Nunnery in Xincang has also been excavated, with corpses and bones exposed and brick fragments scattered everywhere. The tombstone is deeply embedded in the soil, and has now been turned out by surveyors. The tombstone has "The Tomb of Wang Nanxi" written in regular script, with "Written by the Imperial Inspector Si Li in the Second Year of Xuande of the Great Ming" inscribed below. The burial objects are nowhere to be found, presumably having been looted. It is said that the tomb of Qi Jiguang was stolen, but this is a misunderstanding of this tomb. The county government has ordered all district offices to strictly investigate and prohibit tomb raiding.</p>

<p>The mission of Security Director Zhang Yawei's current inspection is to reorganize the Hefei, Lu'an, and Shouxian security groups into security teams, and to supervise the counties in the bandit areas to handle the aftermath. Wu Heqing, an inspector of the Lu'an-Shouxian security team, came with him. Xia Xutang, the head of the Hefei County Security Group, has resigned from his position after being ordered to reorganize, and his resignation has been approved by the province. However, because Xia has made considerable contributions to bandit suppression, the provincial government instructed Chief County Magistrate Wang to assign him another task. As for the establishment of the security team, it has been decided by the county meeting that: (1) Three squadrons and one independent platoon will be organized in the urban area, and five squadrons will be organized in the rural area; (2) The urban area expenses will be supplemented by 1.2% of the land and various agencies, and the rural area expenses will require 100,000 yuan per year, which will be supplemented by 4% of the land; (3) Clear the villages and severely punish several group leaders who collude with bandits or harbor bandits as a warning; (4) Strictly prohibit the planting of opium.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Report on Chen Fu's Tragic Abduction and Murder by Chen Shuren <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>My son, Fu, studied in Soviet Russia, graduated from Sun Yat-sen University, and served as a translator in a Russian military academy for many years. Three years ago, he returned to China and traveled to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tianjin. He was once arrested in Tianjin on suspicion of being a communist, but was released without incident. After returning home from Tianjin last July, he dispelled all thoughts, closed his doors to study, and cut off contact with the outside world. He did not ask about anything external. In his daily life, in addition to spending most of his time in his study, he also hired a teacher to learn German. In his spare time, he grew flowers and fruits, or went horseback riding or to the movies with two or three relatives and friends. Recently, he also asked his younger brother in Shanghai to purchase a large number of ancient Chinese literature books for him to study. Unexpectedly, he went out after lunch on August 10th and never returned. Upon receiving the family report, Shuren telegraphed Chen Jitang on the 15th to investigate. Chen replied on the 17th, firmly stating that the Guangzhou authorities had not detained his son Zhiwen (Fu's other name) (the full text of the original telegram is recorded below). He then replied three more times (the full text of the original letters is recorded below) and also sent another telegram, all firmly denying the detention, only saying that he was missing. He thought that the matter was extremely secret and that there would never be a day of discovery. However, if the matter were not too tragic, and if those who heard about it did not hold extremely indignant and unfair feelings, they would not dare to risk secretly reporting it (The Guangzhou authorities mainly kept the matter extremely secret. Any slight oversight, or anyone who talked about it, would be detained and severely punished). Now, a summary of the confirmed information from various reports is as follows:</p>
<p>The Hong Kong conspiracy group, i.e., a certain faction who previously masterminded the assassination of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, has often fabricated baseless accusations against Shuren for the past half year due to differences in opinions and divergent paths. Even when Shuren held personal painting exhibitions in Beijing and Shanghai, he was constantly scolded by them. Shuren simply laughed it off. However, in early August, they believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of certain matters, and made a destructive plan (this plan involves too much and will not be announced for the time being). They did not hesitate to sacrifice Shuren's son, Chen Fu. Otherwise, if Chen Fu were truly guilty, the authorities could openly arrest him or announce his crimes and execute him. Why would they perform this political "government kidnapping" that has never been heard of in history? This is too dark a secret. First, after the conspiracy group and the Guangzhou authorities reached an agreement, they gave a large sum of money and secretly sent Chen Xingou and Fei Hong, two detectives from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau stationed in Hong Kong, back to Guangzhou. Huang Gangzhong, the secretary of the Public Security Bureau, gave them a warrant. They ambushed near the Qiaoyuan in Dongshan. When they saw Chen Fu leaving, they got on the public bus. The detectives followed him. When Fu got off at the Cangbian Road intersection, the detectives followed him and immediately arrested him and took him to the bureau. The special investigation chief, Liang Yuguang, secretly interrogated him. That night (August 10, 11 p.m.), without saying a word, they secretly transported this pure and unyielding young man, who was only 25 years old, to Nan Shi Tou and tragically shot him. They then claimed that Chen Fu was missing in order to eliminate the traces. In short, this tragic case was carried out by narrow-minded and ruthless people in order to achieve their political destructive conspiracy. They did not hesitate to use the hands of a dignified government official, using a political machine to execute it. Their dark and cruel methods were ten times worse than kidnappers tearing up the ticket. This is truly a political disgrace that has never been seen before in China and abroad. Even if we take a step back and say that Chen Fu must be punished, the most he could be sentenced to is detention, or sent to a reformatory. How could they indulge in torture to such an extreme? However, just from this point alone, we can infer and see through the position of the authorities on politics, law, morality, and human feelings, and the impact on the people. Alas, alas! Written by Chen Shuren on October 5, 1932.</p>
<p>Appendix: Three Telegrams from Chen Jitang (Chen Jitang Telegram) Shanghai to Mr. Chen Shuren: With utmost respect, I have respectfully read your telegram. After inquiring with Public Security Bureau Director He and Military Police Commander Lin, both stated that there was no detention of your son Zhiwen (Fu's other name). To what degree is it accurate he disappeared in Guangzhou, and when was it discovered? Please promptly check and telegraph back to facilitate investigation on my behalf. Respectfully, Chen Jitang, 17th) Printed. (Chen Jitang Letter 1) Mr. Shuren's blessing, Your wife has returned to Guangdong, and I respectfully received your letter. One thing is that your son Zhiwen has not been arrested by the Guangzhou authorities. After previously receiving your esteemed telegram, I have already replied by telegram. I trust that you are aware of this. However, according to the situation described by your daughter, it is suspected that he is missing. I have now formally instructed Public Security Bureau Director He to find a way to investigate, and I also ask your esteemed officials to assist in the process. This is my earnest request. I respectfully reply and wish you well. Yours sincerely, Chen Jitang, August 20. (Chen Jitang Letter 2) To Mr. Shuren: Regarding the matter of your son's disappearance, I have received repeated letters and telegrams and am extremely anxious. However, after investigation, the Public Security Bureau has not detained him. I have already reported the details to your wife. But your affairs are my affairs, and I have strictly instructed the Public Security Bureau to find a way to investigate and will never abandon it. Because Brother Xiangen is going to Beijing, I take this opportunity to report to you. Please advise. Chen Ji Zhuang, August 26. (This is a handwritten letter) Another reply from Chen Jitang on September 10, and a telegram on September 26, are of the same intention as above and are omitted.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th - The Ministry of Education's Elementary School Curriculum Civic Training Revision Committee continued its meeting on the 7th to discuss more than 140 specific standards for the elementary school civic training curriculum, and completely passed them. In terms of nature, about 70 items belong to the moral aspect, about 30 items belong to recreation, and about 20 items each belong to politics and economics. In terms of grade level, there are more than 60 items for lower grades, more than 40 items for middle grades, and more than 30 items for upper grades. Lower grades focus on recreation (such as developing hygiene habits), middle school grades focus on morality to establish a foundation, and upper grades focus on politics and economics. The special feature of this standard is the addition of economics, with special attention to production cooperation. The committee will continue to meet on the 8th to discuss the key points of training, specific standards, and organize classification.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Jiangsu Department of Education Bans Private Middle Schools in the Provincial Capital <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Education recently secretly investigated the management of private middle schools in Zhenjiang. According to the investigation, the foundation of the private Jingjiang Junior Vocational Middle School is very simple, the content is corrupt, and the accumulated expenses exceed 5,000 yuan, making it difficult to maintain. The private Jiangsu Junior Vocational Middle School has exhausted its funds, is poorly managed, and reports untruthfully, intending to deceive. The private Zhenjiang Junior Vocational Middle School, under the name of a vocational school, still runs ordinary courses, and also enrolls second-year students when it is opened, all of which violate the rules. The private Southeast Junior Vocational Middle School did not apply for establishment and the board of directors enrolled students without authorization. The ordinary courses enrolled deviate from the purpose of vocational education. The normal school is not suitable for private schools to run. Also, at the beginning of its operation, all grades recruited second-year students, which is inconsistent with current laws and regulations. Director Zhou believes that these schools are poorly managed and should be strictly banned to avoid misleading young people. He ordered that Jingjiang Vocational Middle School be disbanded immediately and be responsible for the ending by the school, the Jiangsu Vocational Middle School's board of directors be revoked, and the original application for establishment not be approved. Zhenjiang Vocational Middle School should change its ordinary courses to business courses according to the approved original plan. The existing third grade should extend the term to complete training. Southeast Vocational Middle School should abolish the ordinary and normal courses and change to business or other vocational courses. The enrolled second-year students should be uniformly changed to first-year students to comply with the Ministry of Education's orders, and follow the prescribed registration procedures and apply for approval in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Over the Past Twenty Years <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Statistics of Elementary School Teachers in Jiangsu Province: The United Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu has compiled statistics on the number of elementary school teachers in various counties of Jiangsu Province from the first year to the twentieth year of the Republic of China, comparing them year by year and making a general comparison every five years. Here are some of the main points:</p>
<p>(1) The total number of teachers in the counties increased from 9,312 in the first year to 19,332 in the twentieth year, an increase of 10,020, or more than 2.2 times, with an average annual increase of 527 teachers (according to the statistics, from the first year to the twentieth year, the number of schools increased by 1.77 times, the number of classes increased by 2.2 times, the number of children increased by 3.2 times, and the funding increased by 3.23 times).</p>
<p>(2) Comparing the number of teachers increased in each year with the previous year, the order of the amount is as follows: First, the 17th year, 2,300 people; Second, the 4th year, 1,122 people; Third, the 0th year, 974 people; Fourth, the 1st year, 961 people; Fifth, the 3rd year, 933 people; Sixth, the 14th year, 839 people; Seventh, the 6th year, 765 people; Eighth, the 5th year, 740 people; Ninth, the 8th year, 727 people; Tenth, the 7th year, 691 people; Eleventh, the 2nd year, 680 people; Twelfth, the 9th year, 670 people; Thirteenth, the 12th year, 524 people; Fourteenth, the 20th year, 312 people; Fifteenth, the 18th year, 236 people; Sixteenth, the 6th year, 226 people; Seventeenth, the 13th year, a decrease of 171 people; Eighteenth, the 19th year, a decrease of 617 people; Nineteenth, the 15th year, a decrease of 2,234 people.</p>
<p>(3) Observing the above statistics, it can be seen that the number of schools increased in each year did not increase annually, and the increase and decrease were quite inconsistent. The increase was the largest in the 17th year and the smallest in the 13th year. Especially in the 15th and 19th years, there were reductions compared to the previous year, totaling 2,851 people.</p>
<p>(4) Making a comparison every five years, the 5th year increased by 3,475 people compared to the 1st year, the 10th year increased by 3,288 people compared to the 5th year, the 15th year increased by 261 people compared to the 10th year, and the 20th year increased by 2 and 96 people compared to the 15th year. On average, each five-year period increased by 868 people, the second five-year period increased by 657 people, the third five-year period increased by only 52 people, and the fourth five-year period increased by 599 people. It can be seen that the number of teachers increased more in the early Republic of China, and the reduction in the middle was special.</p>
<p>(5) Comparing the situation of each county, the most in the first year was 774 in Wujin, and the least was 4 in Yangzhou. In the twentieth year, the most was 1,436 in Wuxi, and the least was 32 in Yangzhou.</p>
<p>(6) In the 20 years, the number of teachers in each county has increased and decreased from time to time. Comparing the 10th year with the 1st year, the counties with a decrease are Wujiang and Dangshan. Comparing the 20th year with the 1st year, the counties with a decrease are Shanghai, Taicang, and Shiying.</p>
<p>(7) In the first year, there were 32 counties with less than 100 teachers, including Xuhai and Ningyang. In the twentieth year, there were only 10 counties with less than 100 teachers, including Yangzhou, Baoying, Siyang, Jiangpu, Donghai, Pi, Gan Yu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, and Jiangning.</p>
<p>(8) The proportion of teachers increased in each county varies greatly. For example, comparing the 20th year with the 1st year, the largest increase was in Lishui, from 6 to 107 people, an increase of 18 times. The smallest increase was in Pi County, from 53 to 81 people, less than half. The remaining counties with an increase of more than 2 times include Jurong, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhou, Chuansha, Shishan, Haimen, Jingjiang, Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, Lianshui, Funing, Yancheng, Xinghua, Taixian, Tongshan, Fengxian, Pei County, Yangshan, Suqian, Donghai, Guanyun, Ganyu, Suining, and Shuyang, a total of 21 counties.</p>

The competition schedule is as follows: Sun Linfang vs. Liang Deguang in singles, Zheng Zhaojia and Jiang Daozhang vs. Sun and Liang in doubles.

<p>Sun Daosheng Overcomes Hong Yukui. The Old General's Might Still Exists, and a Second-Place Finish is Promising.</p>
<p>Both Battles End 21-19.</p>
<p>In this year's Youth Association handball competition, Sun Daosheng is the only surviving veteran who has been consistently outstanding for more than ten years. Yesterday, he met Hong Yukui, the defending champion, whom the audience considered to be the only promising young hero in the future. Between the old and the young, there were all kinds of tricks and wonderful performances. At the beginning of the first game, Hong saved the ball several times, escaping from death, creating a superior situation and rising steadily, from 14-4 to 19-12. At that time, Sun was at a disadvantage, but as soon as the opportunity came, he immediately reversed the situation and won with 21-19. The situation in the second game was tighter than before, and both sides seemed to be at a horizontal level, with the difference always between one or two points. As a result, Sun won again with 21-19, and a second-place finish is very promising. Although Hong lost, his brave spirit and superb skills were still appreciated by the audience. A hero lost to a good man is also reasonable. Zhu Shi defeated Ma Ling 2-0 (Luan). Jing Fan Hua defeated Zhong Zhong (Dong) 2-0. The battle between Hong Rulin and Lu Luosheng was also very close. Lu took the lead and won the first game with 21-16. Unexpectedly, Hong worked hard to counterattack and won the last victory by winning two consecutive games with 21-6 and 21-11.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Various Charity Organizations Gave a Banquet for the Press</p>
<p>Qu Yingguang and Others Will Go North to Distribute Relief</p>
<p>Jiangwan Racecourse Races to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations' United Association for Relief of Northeast Refugees hosted a reception for news reporters yesterday afternoon at the 9th floor of the Baxianqiao Youth Association. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Association, Wang Yiting, Vice Chairman, Wen Lanting, Zheng Hongnian, Zhao Xi'en, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Yinjiang, Huang Bodu, Qu Yingguang, Chen Qicai, and more than forty reporters from various newspapers were present. Xu Shiying chaired the meeting, reporting on the disaster situation in the Northeast and the association's work progress. In addition to the disaster situation in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Harbin, which was recorded in yesterday's newspaper, details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Chairman's Report <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>During the meeting, Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Association, stood up and reported, "I am grateful for your presence at our association today. I and my colleagues in this association follow the lead of various social groups and philanthropists, and do our best to provide relief and assistance to those in need. We have been doing this for years. In peacetime, we provide relief to those affected by floods, droughts, and other disasters, and rescue the dying and help the injured. My colleagues are already extremely saddened by these events. This time, in providing relief to the disaster in the Northeast, I feel particularly sad. In terms of our duty, we cannot refuse. In terms of humanity, we must act immediately. Now, I will briefly report on the establishment process and resolutions of this association, as well as the situation of the emergency relief work being carried out in the most severely affected disaster areas in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. Please provide guidance. This association was formed by the most historical and successful charity organizations in Shanghai, and its purpose is purely charitable and its procedures are righteous. It was established on August 23rd of this year at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road in this city. There are a total of nine united charity groups, named as follows: Chinese Red Cross Society, China International Famine Relief Commission, World Red Swastika Society, Chinese Jisheng Society, Lianyi Charity Society, Huisheng Charity Society, Chinese Moral Improvement Society, Pushan Villa, Xinwei Relief Society. The severity of the floods in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces this year is unprecedented. The brief situation of the investigation report of this association is not even a fraction of the whole picture. I have specially printed and distributed copies so that you can get a glimpse. Mr. Yang Zigong, the relief representative of the four northeastern provinces, recently came to Shanghai from Beiping to report to the meeting. He said that representatives of the disaster victims in various places have come to Beiping to beg for help, and the number is endless. It is early winter in the borderlands, and the weather is already very cold. Currently, the relief supplies needed most are grain, as well as leather and cotton clothing. The association is now planning to quickly raise large sums of relief money and purchase relief supplies to carry out emergency relief. In addition to the 150,000 yuan that the association and its united charity groups have advanced, the Relief Committee has allocated 50,000 yuan, and the Penang Reading Newspaper Society has donated 30,000 yuan. It is planned to purchase winter clothing in Harbin and distribute it selectively. We will also actively solicit donations in various ways to continue to provide relief, food, or cash. There is no need to worry about the distribution of relief supplies by this association, because the united charity groups, such as the Chinese Red Cross Society and the World Red Cross Society, have been providing relief in the three northeastern provinces for many years and have many branches that can distribute supplies on the spot, accurately to each household and name. The income and expenditure of relief funds will be strictly in accordance with the rules, and every penny will go to the disaster-stricken compatriots. However, the water damage in Jilin and Heilongjiang is severe, the number of disaster victims is large, and the disaster area is extremely vast. It is necessary to rely on the charitable men and women from China and abroad, to work together and cooperate to rescue the disaster and reverse the catastrophe. You are enthusiastic about good deeds and act bravely when you see what is right. Whenever a disaster comes, you shout loudly and call on the government and society to work together to provide relief. Now, I respectfully ask for the sympathy of human mutual assistance, the merit of rescuing the drowning and helping the hungry, and to vigorously publicize and solicit donations on our behalf. Then, to get the northeastern disaster victims out of the water and fire, and to put them to rest on their beds, depends on the benevolence of the benevolent. I and others respectfully represent the 30 million disaster victims in the Northeast and thank you very much.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Responses from Hosts and Guests <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's speech, Zheng Hongnian, Qu Yingguang, and Wang Xiaolai successively gave speeches, stating the importance of rescuing the refugees in the Northeast is no less important than assisting the volunteer army. Qu also used the analogy of a daughter being taken away, and if the mother's family ignores it, after a long time, the daughter will have no good feelings for the mother's family and will instead harbor resentment. He cited the example of Germany's defeat in the European War because its people ran out of food. Wang used the analogy of treating illnesses with both offensive and palliative prescriptions, which were extremely alarming. Later, Qian Hua, representing the reporters, gave a reply, stating the three major significance of rescuing the refugees in the Northeast in terms of international anti-Japanese and anti-puppet, and took the essence of people's cooperation as the foundation for recovering the lost land in the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Qu and Others Going North <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The association's executive directors decided in a previous meeting to send the executive director Qu Yingguang, Wang Peiyuan of the Red Cross Society, and Feng Yangshan of the Chinese Jisheng Society north to distribute relief. Therefore, Qu said during yesterday's meeting that he would go north within two weeks, if there were no special reasons, to discuss relief methods with Mr. Xiong Bingsan of the Tianjin Office. In any case, he would ensure that the relief funds and materials were transported to the disaster area so that the refugees could benefit from them and the money would not be wasted.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Donation Situation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Since the association was established, few donation brochures have been distributed, so it has received only more than 6,000 yuan in donations. In addition, the nine initiating groups have advanced 150,000 yuan, the Relief Committee has allocated 50,000 yuan, and the Penang Reading Newspaper Society has donated 30,000 yuan. (This total amount of 60,000 yuan has not been used for a long time because the receiving agency was unclear. Recently, 30,000 yuan was allocated to the Northeast Relief Association and distributed by General Zhu Ziqiao, and 30,000 yuan was allocated to the United Relief Association.) Recently, it has been slightly obtained. A certain number of large companies in this city have agreed to donate 5% of their sales proceeds within four days, and it is scheduled for the 16th and 26th of this month, when the Wanguo Jiangwan Yinxiang Sanhui will volunteer to race horses at Jiangwan, and the proceeds from the sale of tickets will be used for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Raising Emergency Relief <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The association believes that the refugees in the Northeast have suffered both war and floods, and the weather is getting colder, so relief is more urgent than ever. It has repeatedly published articles in newspapers to appeal to the public. The association has now received a report on the flooding in Jilin and Heilongjiang. More than 40,000 refugees in Yilan County, Jilin Province, are lacking food. 7,500 households in Weihe County have flooded houses. The total losses are about 3 million. In the deepest part of Harbin, the water is 14 or 15 feet deep. The Red Cross Society has successively provided relief and accommodated 23,267 refugees. About 80,000 refugees who have escaped to high ground refuse to give up their goods and still live in buildings. About 100,000 people are still living in buildings. The flood-affected area in Heilongjiang Province is even wider. Longjiang, Qinggang, Yalu, Nehe, Gannan, Hulan, Tonghe, and Mulan counties have all become swamps. The loss of life and property is countless. The refugees are hungry and cold. Various charity groups and the Northeast Refugee Relief Association invite the press to take photographs.</p>
<p>They are exposed to the elements and are in a terrible state. It was decided to first carry out emergency relief in the most severely affected disaster areas in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will follow the principle of saving the people is saving the country, and generously donate money to contribute to this good cause.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Mrs. Moore of the United States Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Representing German People</p>
<p>Comforting the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Mrs. Moore, a German-American residing in Germany, representing various sectors of the German public, came to Shanghai to comfort our anti-Japanese 19th Route Army. She arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 6:00 a.m. aboard the "Africa," the first Far East-bound mail ship of the Danish East Asiatic Company. After arriving, Mrs. Moore stayed at the Astor House Hotel on the Bund and immediately sent telegrams to various newspaper reporters, inviting them for a conversation.</p>
<h3 id="e157">This Mission <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Moore first described her mission for this trip, stating, "I am here purely to represent various sectors of the German public and to comfort the soldiers of your country's 19th Route Army who bravely resisted the aggressors. The entire German people express their deepest sympathy for your country and your country's loyal and brave 19th Route Army. When the 19th Army was resisting Japan in Shanghai, the entire German people were extremely concerned. After your country's English version of the 'National Forum' was sent to Germany, we were extremely pleased with the detailed accounts of the 19th Army and the portraits of its soldiers. We were also amazed that the 19th Army was resisting Japan with such meager strength. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Germany, as well as major corporations, are willing to contribute to comfort the soldiers of the 19th Army. Since I had a trip to your country, they entrusted me with the task of delivering these gifts. However, the German side was not sure what items would be most useful, so they could not rashly send them. Therefore, I only brought various samples this time, waiting for the authorities of the 19th Route Army to decide what is needed and in what quantity, and then I will send a telegram to the relevant German companies to arrange for shipment to your country. Currently, the value of the gifts prepared by the German side to comfort the 19th Army is at least 5,000 US dollars."</p>
<h3 id="e158">European and American Attitudes Toward China <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Moore then spoke about the attitudes of European and American countries toward China, saying, "After leaving Germany, I went to various European and American countries for observation. Except for Soviet Russia, I have visited almost all major European and American countries. Some people in Europe and America do have sympathy for China, but most of them do not have an accurate understanding of China due to a lack of knowledge of the situation. When I was in Geneva, the news I heard about China was mostly malicious propaganda deliberately spread by a certain party. This should also be remedied in international public opinion. I believe that since the Chinese side now has a very large radio station, it should report to Geneva as soon as possible and transmit all the latest news, shifting the world's attention. Because propaganda is extremely important in the international arena now." She also said, "If the Chinese government could provide a nominally Chinese public opinion circle with considerable assistance, she would be very willing to take responsibility for external propaganda on behalf of China."</p>
<h3 id="e159">Lytton Report <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mrs. Moore also criticized the League of Nations investigation team's Lytton Report, saying, "That report is truly a boastful work. I had already heard about its contents when I was in Europe. People in Europe and America are very dissatisfied with the report, saying that it is not only powerless but also fails to distinguish right from wrong. However, the international community expresses unanimous admiration for China's diplomatic talents. The Chinese embassy in Germany is able to integrate well with the entire German public. She is also friendly with people such as Liang Long, the embassy counselor. Mr. Liang even asked her to convey his regards to friends in Shanghai during this trip to Shanghai. European and American countries not only admire China's diplomatic talents, but also unanimously praise Dr. Wellington Koo's recent work as being extremely valuable." While saying this, Mrs. Moore also said, "You can deeply believe my words. I can even cite an example to show the respect and love of European and American people for your country's diplomats. Several months ago, in the Mediterranean, when the French mail ship 'Georges Philippar' had an accident, the bad news came that Minister Shih Chao-chi, who was negotiating at the League of Nations, had also died in the disaster. All sectors in Europe and America were greatly shocked and even flew flags at half-mast to express their condolences. Then they learned that the facts were wrong, and they burst into laughter."</p>
<h3 id="e160">Talking About General Ma <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Moore then took out the English version of General Ma Zhanshan's anti-Japanese telegram and told reporters that European and American people not only admired your country's 19th Route Army, but also greatly admired General Ma Zhanshan. If General Ma Zhanshan wanted to raise funds in Europe and America at this time, I can guarantee that tens of millions could be raised in 48 hours, because all parties in Europe and America unanimously admire General Ma Zhanshan's character.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Going to the Capital <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Moore then said that she would be going to the capital in the near future, but the date has not been determined. She has many missions for this trip, but other than comforting the 19th Route Army soldiers, she cannot announce anything else. She gained a good understanding of the situation in various countries towards China during her trip to Europe and America, so she intends to meet with the Chinese government authorities. Finally, she led the reporters to see the consolation samples she brought, which totaled more than a hundred kinds, mostly medical supplies for wounded soldiers' hospitals. There were also dozens of kinds of cigarettes, but they were all samples.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Factories Do Not Take Holiday on National Day <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Normal Work Without Double Pay</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating, "Regarding the joint notice, we have received a telegram from the Central Executive Committee, stating, 'It has been found that this year's Double Ten Festival will not be a holiday due to the national crisis, which is different from normal holidays. Factories will operate as usual and should not pay double wages. Please comply and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly.'

<p>Notification to All Users Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the British-owned Shanghai Water Company changed to a meter system, water rates have increased sharply, in some cases by as much as nine times. Various rental agencies and public groups have negotiated with the company directly and indirectly. The company also felt that the increase was too large and issued a notice yesterday, notifying all users, "Regarding the bills you sent, which are calculated based on the water meter reading, if they exceed the amount paid under the previous monthly system by too much, please notify our company so that we can investigate the cause of the excess use. In order to temporarily change the water rate during the investigation period, please include the account number of the location in all the notification letters you drop off for reference.

<p>Collecting Self-Defense Weapons From the People and Forcing People to Build Railways</p>
<p>The Kuo Wen News Agency reported that General Ma Zhanshan, on the 6th, reported to the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association about the Japanese's tyranny. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (omitted above) "The telegram states that in August of this year, the Japanese expanded the Qiqihar and Hailun railways to reach the intersection of Bei'an Town in Tongbei County, forcing tens of thousands of people to work. It is currently being actively carried out. They are also forcibly confiscating the people's weapons, causing them to lose their ability to defend themselves, resulting in an endless stream of people fleeing. According to their statements, there are also various acts of oppression, looting, and rape. It has been found that Jiang Province has suffered from military disasters followed by floods, and the lives of the people are hanging by a thread. However, the Japanese are harassing everywhere. They have already missed the farming season, and now, at the time of harvest, they are depriving them of their livelihood again. Even if they want to live in peace, they cannot. They are displaced and miserable. Judging from their intentions, they not only enslave our people, but also want to eliminate our race. If there is no effective rescue method, then tens of millions of compatriots in the Northeast will be doomed, and our beautiful mountains and rivers will ultimately not be ours. We would like to hear your association's plans. Should the above-mentioned Japanese expansion of railways, forced confiscation of weapons, and obstruction of the farming season and cutting off the livelihood of the people be reported to the League of Nations General Assembly? We hope you will consider this. Ma Zhanshan bows."</p>

<p>Welcomed Director Zhang Hui and Weng Zhaoyuan</p>
<p>Brigadier General Weng Zhaoyuan of the 19th Route Army arrived in Shanghai from Xiamen on the 4th. In addition to discussing the development of aviation and the implementation of China's aviation plan with the directors of the Aviation Construction Association, he was also accompanied by Yin Zhiling and others to visit the leaders of various groups. At 7:00 p.m. on the 7th, the Aviation Construction Association held a welcome meeting for Director Zhang Hui and Brigadier General Weng at the auditorium on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including Director Zhang Hui, Weng Zhaoyuan, Chief of Staff Zhang, Xu Shiying, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Fucheng, Yin Zhiling, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Binhe, Wang Peiyuan, and Shao Yingrui. Chu Fucheng, the chairman, gave a welcome speech, stating that we welcome Director Zhang Hui and Brigadier General Weng. Mr. Zhang is a pioneer in the aviation industry, and we hope that he will join the Aviation Construction Association and guide us. Mr. Weng is an anti-Japanese soldier and also the initiator of this association. We welcome him for two reasons: one for his anti-Japanese achievements and the other for his abandonment of his army. This is worth welcoming. Yin Zhiling then reported on the association's affairs and expressed hope that everyone would work hard to build aviation. After Yin's report, Director Zhang Hui gave a speech, the general idea being that he hoped that the Aviation Construction Association would expand its organization. He mentioned the reasons for the development of foreign aviation and the lack of aviation in China. There are two reasons: one is the lack of various specialized talents, and the other is the lack of government planning. In the future, people from all walks of life will work together to join the Aviation Construction Association to make aviation popular among the people. Then Mr. Weng stood up and stated that the aviation industry must rely on national assistance, otherwise there is no way to develop it. Later, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Peiyuan, and others gave speeches one after another, encouraging aviation, pooling efforts, and helping the country.</p>

<h3 id="e170">The Audit Office Abolishes Malpractices in Salt Affairs <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>A Circular is Issued to All Bureaus and Offices for Compliance</p>
<p>Since the General Audit Office of Salt Affairs of the Ministry of Finance received the order from the Ministry to take over various administrative organs of salt affairs, it has been making great efforts in the work of reorganization. In addition to greatly reducing the original administrative personnel, it has recently begun to clear up the long-standing malpractices of salt affairs. It is said that the biggest of the administrative malpractices is the acceptance of malpractices. The General Office has issued a circular to all subordinates, instructing them to investigate and eliminate all the original malpractices in their respective districts. In the future, no officials under their jurisdiction may accept malpractices or other gifts. If they dare to violate this, they will be severely punished upon discovery. On one hand, the主管机关 (responsible authorities) of each subordinate department should announce to merchants and people that they should not offer malpractices to salt affairs personnel in the future. If they are found, they will be prosecuted for bribery. If there is any extortion under the pretext of needing money, they are also allowed to report it for investigation. The General Office's intention to actively reorganize salt affairs administration can be seen in general. It is heard that the circular has been issued to the four branches of the Eastern Huai, Northern Huai, Yangzhou, Songjiang, Liangzhe, and Fujian Provinces, as well as the four-shore audit offices and the Henan tax collection bureau. The full text of the circular is recorded below for compliance.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It is an order for compliance. It has been found that the administrative affairs of salt affairs in the district</p>
<p>have already been taken over by the局 (Bureau) (所) (Office) (处) according to the order of the Ministry, and all the previous bad habits are extremely difficult to carry out. 净清 (clean up) and do not let the 진행 (progress) of the textile整理 (reorganization) work. It has been made known that they have complied. However, after investigation, the biggest problem in the administrative aspects of salt affairs is the acceptance of malpractices. It has been practiced for a long time, and it has been taken for granted. The giver considers it an obligation, and the receiver also regards it as a right to be enjoyed. In reality, it is no different from accepting bribes and seeking personal gain. If we want to achieve the clarity of salt affairs administration, we must make the elimination of malpractices an urgent task. All the original malpractices in the salt affairs aspects of the district must be thoroughly investigated and eliminated. In addition, officials under their jurisdiction should be strictly ordered that no one should accept malpractices or other gifts from merchants and people in the future. If they dare to do so, they will be severely punished upon discovery. On one hand, it is still necessary to announce to the merchants and people that they are not allowed to offer any malpractices or gifts to salt affairs personnel in the future. If there are those who cling to old habits and do not know how to reform, they will be prosecuted for bribery and punished in the same way as the receiver. If there is any case of salt affairs personnel asking for money under the pretext of wanting money, they are also allowed to report it based on the circumstances for investigation. We will keep the reporters of merchants secret and will not cause any delay. Officials and merchants will work together to ensure that the long-term malpractices will be completely eradicated in the shortest possible time. From now on, the malpractice will be eradicated and the atmosphere will be clean, which will be in line with the Ministry's intention to actively reorganize. In addition to issuing orders for compliance, it is urgently ordered that the局 (Bureau) (所) (Office) (处) comply strictly and not be negligent. The compliance situation should be reported for verification. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Interpretation of Foreigners Obtaining Patent Rights in China <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Replied to Lawyer Xu Shihui</p>
<p>The Nature of Reciprocal Benefits for Sino-Foreign</p>
<p>Not Applicable to Countries That Have Not Reciprocated</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a reply to lawyer Xu Shihui, explaining the measures for foreigners to obtain patent rights in China, stating, "We received your letter on the 6th of this month, inquiring about whether the industrial manufacturing patent rights obtained by foreigners in foreign countries can be effective within China. If they cannot be effective within China, can they apply for registration of their patent rights with the Ministry of Industry in order to protect their rights? After investigation, Section 10 of the Sino-American Supplementary Treaty on Commerce and Navigation of the 29th Year of Guangxu states, "The United States government allows Chinese people to register their inventions in the United States and issue invention licenses to protect their rights to self-management and self-use. The Chinese government also agrees to establish a special management office for inventions in the future. After the establishment of the special management office and the enactment of special laws on inventions, any inventions in China that are eligible for approval and have already been licensed by the United States, if they do not violate the inventions of Chinese people, can be protected by issuing special licenses to American people after paying the regulations fees. Later, the second half of Section 15 of the Sino-Portuguese Supplementary Treaty of the 30th Year of Guangxu also has the same provision. That is to say, if the people of these two countries want to maintain their patent rights in China, they should apply to the Ministry of Industry for approval and registration in accordance with the treaty before they can enjoy them. However, it should be noted that this is a special clause specially stipulated for the mutual protection of patent rights between the two countries, which is a matter of reciprocity. It is different from the unconditional most-favored-nation treatment mentioned in other clauses. Therefore, this benefit cannot be extrapolated to other countries that have not signed reciprocal special clauses. The opinions of several associations are as such. If the lawyer does not mind seeking details, he can inquire with the Ministry of Industry in order to strike a fair balance.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Reply Letter of the Taxpayers' Association on the Water Issue <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Recognizes That the Municipal Council's Reply Letter Does Not Attach Importance to the Case</p>
<p>Discuss Further Reasonable and Practical Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association has previously received letters from various real estate companies and rental agencies, reporting that the water rates have increased sharply after the conversion of water meters and requesting that measures be taken to negotiate. The association has forwarded the letters to the Municipal Council for handling. It was not until September 24 that the association received a reply from the Municipal Council. The association specially sent a letter yesterday to reply to the companies and agencies, stating, "Regarding the case of the sharp increase in water rates calculated by water meters, which cannot be afforded, we have repeatedly sent letters to the 总办 (Chief Executive Officer) of the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting that measures be taken quickly. It was not until September 24 that we received a reply from the 总办 (Chief Executive Officer), which reads, "We have received your letter of September 19, concerning the low collection of water fees by the Shanghai Water Company. We have found that the various statements issued by this bureau regarding water and water meters have been published in the gazette and should have been reviewed by you. We will not repeat them. As for the cases mentioned in your letter, it is easier to consider the high and low of the fees if we first find out the amount of water used in each case and the amount of water fees per unit. Your association does not seem to pay attention to this when writing the letter. This bureau has reported its position on the issue of water prices from time to time and published it in the gazette. We cannot explain everything in one letter. If your association can send a representative to come, I will explain it, and if there are any accumulated opinions, we can discuss them face-to-face. I hope that your association can take this opportunity to carefully consider the points raised in your letter, and it will be more helpful to avoid making empty threats. This bureau is very concerned about the promotion of the interests of the citizens, and it is especially concerned about practical facts." In addition to recognizing that the case has not been taken seriously, we will discuss further reasonable and practical methods that are easy to implement and do not increase the burden on poor small households. We hereby send this letter for your information and request your valuable opinions to correct our shortcomings.</p>

<p>Document Submitted to the Ministry of Interior and Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens Yao Wenxuan, Shen Wenbin, Jia Fengyun, Shi Qiguang, Wang Yugang, Tang Fuqian, Hu Renfeng, Zhang Zongfu, Gu Xiaoqing, Zhu Lijian, Jin Qingzhang, Cao Yuanjun, Li Zuyou, Zheng Yi, Wang Quanyun, Tai Xichu, Huang Yunzhen, Qian Jiao, Liu Donghai, Jia Jiying, Sheng Linshu, and others oppose selling accumulated grain, real estate, and public property, and have submitted documents to the Executive Yuan and other bodies. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we present the document submitted to the Ministry of Interior and Jiangsu Provincial Government as follows: The document states, "Regarding the matter of handling accumulated grain in Shanghai, there are indeed special circumstances. We request that public property be preserved to appease the people and address famine relief. The Shanghai Municipal and County Division of the Accumulated Grain Property Valuation Committee has already determined the prices and resolved to auction them. The committee is acting on the principle of fairness across the city and county. However, since the prices have already been assessed and there are differences in the size of houses and land, compensation can be made with existing funds. If there is no other intention, why must property be disposed of? Upon investigation, Shanghai's accumulated grain, from the sixth year of Tongzhi to the sixth year of Guangxu, over seven terms of land tax, yielded only 110,700 strings of cash. Over 20,300 stones of grain were purchased for storage, but due to the low and damp terrain, the grain was prone to mold and spoilage. Through years of drying, replacement, and exchanges, there were significant losses. Therefore, in the sixth year of Guangxu, it was decided to accumulate cash instead of grain. A request was submitted to Magistrate Mo Xiangzhi, who received approval from Governor Tan Junpei. During the upheavals of Gengzi and Xinhai, financial panic and market instability occurred. Deeply aware of the dangers of accumulating cash, a portion of the deposits was used in the third year of the Republic to convert empty warehouses into residential buildings, generating rental income and interest. Within ten years, over 100,000 yuan was accumulated, which was entirely borrowed by He Fenglin, the Songhu Military Governor. Our people learned a severe lesson from this, leading to the consensus that accumulating property is better than accumulating cash. This is the experience our people have gained through repeated changes. Recently, your Ministry issued a general order to all counties to replenish granaries, a noble intention and sound policy that should be followed. However, in Shanghai, agricultural production consists of 70% cotton and 30% rice. Residents rely on imported rice for their food. Fortunately, rice merchants converge, and rice from inland and overseas gathers in Shanghai. Farmers are only concerned about lacking money, not about lacking rice. This is Shanghai's unique situation, different from inland areas. The city has a dense population of approximately 3 million, and the county has over 100,000.</p>
<p>The daily rice consumption is 30,000 to 40,000 stones. Even if the current estimated land price is used to purchase rice, it would only yield 50,000 stones, enough for the city and county for only two days, which is still insufficient. To prepare adequately, it would be necessary to raise 10 million yuan and accumulate 1 million stones of rice to feed the people for one month. This is Shanghai's unique situation, different from other counties. As for converting immovable property into movable property to earn interest, it may indeed yield more than rent. However, today, all institutions and organizations are financially strained. Upon seeing this cash, everyone will try to get their hands on it. We fear that there will not only be one He Fenglin, but countless He Fenglins who will use borrowing as a pretext, obtain it by force or cunning, and gradually dissipate it. Even if the government prohibits misappropriation, the people closely supervise, and the officials in charge can overcome personal feelings and refuse to compromise, there is no guarantee against unexpected losses. Furthermore, Shanghai is currently short of cash and flooded with bonds. Speculative ventures are constantly changing. Regardless of the business, there is a possibility of failure. This is also the experience our people have gained, leading them to believe that accumulating property is better than accumulating cash. We, the citizens, believe that the foundation of property accumulated by our people over sixty years is used for annual storage of rent and interest, to alleviate medical expenses, provide small-scale famine relief, and, in times of great famine, attract rice merchants with mortgages of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to provide a continuous supply, which can widely help and reward farmers. Therefore, we dare to request that your Ministry (Government) consider the situation, instruct Shanghai County to divide the land fairly according to the prices assessed by the committee. If there are differences in quantity that are difficult to divide, they should be compensated with cash. Do not auction off farmland, preserve the original property, and prepare for unexpected needs. Then, your Ministry (Government) will have brought profound and far-reaching benefits to the region. Furthermore, Shanghai rice merchants are willing to donate five cents of silver per stone of rice sold to a granary fund, which is estimated to yield 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per year. If the mayor takes advantage of this situation to achieve the storage of 1 million stones, it is also what we, the citizens, earnestly desire. Apart from submitting copies, we respectfully submit this."</p>
<p>The Pucheng Native Association Telegrams a Request for Post-Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Fujian Pucheng Native Association in Shanghai sends a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, Minister He, and Director Chiang in Fuzhou, stating, "Omitted titles" Pucheng in Fujian is located at the intersection of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, with steep mountain ranges and fertile land, and a large population. It serves as a shield for northern Fujian, making it extremely important. If it is lost and not defended, there will be no natural barriers to defend the interior. Currently, the defense is entrusted to the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army under Huang Bingwu, which is poorly equipped and weak in strength. As a result, on the 25th day of the 9th month, it was attacked and captured by the Red Bandits. Over 100 people were killed, over 200 people were captured, and hundreds of houses were burned down. The city walls were destroyed, and the loss of public and private property is estimated to exceed 5 million yuan. After the bandits had looted their fill, fearing that the Jiangxi forces would cut off their retreat, they left fully loaded on the 27th day. The Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army under Nie initially retreated 60 li to Shuibei Township. Upon hearing that the bandits had left, they shamelessly returned to the city on the 28th day, causing extreme terror throughout the county. This is because the bandits announced that they would return after the harvest. Upon investigation, the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army was responsible for abandoning the three counties of Shaowu, Guangze, and Chongan last year, allowing them to be captured by the Red Bandits. They should have been punished long ago according to the law. However, they repeatedly fabricated reports of victories after the Red Bandits from Chongan looted various important market towns in Shipo, Linjiang, Yangxi, Weixi, Xixiang Street, Punting, Niankeng, and Jiumu, in order to claim credit. The bandits' policy is to loot, and they have no intention of occupying Pucheng's villages and towns for long, as evidenced by the fact that they looted the city for three days before leaving. Since Pucheng is strategically important, it cannot be defended by an undisciplined, poorly trained, and poorly equipped Provincial Defense Army. We request that the Fujian Pacification Headquarters immediately transfer the useless Provincial Defense Army back to the interior for training and order the 56th Division to send troops to fill the defense gap, thereby strengthening the border and preventing the bandits from escaping. We await orders." "Omitted below"</p>

<p>The Yongyuan Ship Has Been Dispatched for Towing</p>
<p>The Zhenji Company, located at the Catholic Church entrance on Er Yangjing Bridge, is the agent for the Datongxing Company of Yingkou's Yuanshun ship. This time, it was tasked by Yixing Firm on Sanmalu to load 26,000 packages of relief salt in Haizhou and transport them to Yuezhou for unloading. It passed Songjiang the day before yesterday and sailed to the Yangtze River. The company received a telegram yesterday stating that at approximately 3:00 PM on the 6th, the ship ran aground near Xiaogushan, 20 li downstream from Jiujiang. After receiving the telegram, the firm immediately notified Yixing Firm and telegraphed the ship to hire nearby barges to lighten the load of the iron-hulled barges to help it float. It also dispatched the Yongyuan ship from Shanghai to the scene to attempt towing. It is reported that although the ship ran aground, it is not severely damaged. However, there was no news of it being out of danger as of last night.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Dispute Over the Collision Between the Yunlong and Yongyuan Ships <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Yongyuan Shipyard's Yongyuan ship was transporting goods to Beijing and was damaged by the Heng'an Company's Yunlong ship near Shierxu. It has now returned to Shanghai. Due to the issue of responsibility, the two parties are in dispute. Yongyuan submitted a request to the Maritime Bureau yesterday to send personnel for inspection. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Circumstances of the Collision <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Yongyuan ship departed for Nanjing on the 3rd of this month to transport flour to Tanggu. At 5:30 PM, while sailing near Yinjiatou on the Jiangmian River in the vicinity of Shierxu, the Yunlong ship was departing from Shierxu. Before the two ships met, the Yongyuan sounded its horn twice, but the Yunlong did not respond. As the Yongyuan proceeded, the Yunlong suddenly yielded to a German merchant ship, the Juhai, and violently collided with the side of the Yongyuan. Caught off guard, the captain of the Yongyuan quickly put the ship in reverse at full speed, fortunately preventing the collision from reaching the engine room. Otherwise, the Yongyuan would have been broken in two. As a result, the third cabin on the starboard side of the Yongyuan was violently struck by the bow of the Yunlong.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Both Ships Damaged <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Yongyuan suffered a large hole approximately one zhang in size where it was struck on the outside of the third cabin on the starboard side. Many items on deck were also damaged. Fortunately, it was above the waterline, and the ship, being empty, did not sink. The Yunlong, being heavily loaded, also suffered damage to its bow due to the excessive force of the collision. After the two ships were damaged, they were unable to sail and each sought ways to return to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Issue of Responsibility <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Yongyuan Shipyard believes that the collision was due to the Yunlong's navigational error and that it should bear full responsibility for the accident. The Yongyuan was damaged on its side, while the Yunlong was damaged on its bow, proving the cause of the collision. The Heng'an Company argues that the Yunlong was yielding to the German ship, resulting in the collision with the Yongyuan, and that the Yongyuan should bear the responsibility. The two parties disagree, causing a major dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Maritime Bureau Inspection <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Yongyuan was originally scheduled to enter the dock for major repairs upon arrival in Shanghai. However, due to the issue of responsibility, it reported the incident to the Maritime Bureau yesterday after the ship arrived, requesting that personnel be sent to the ship for inspection to clarify the responsibility and facilitate claiming compensation from Heng'an. At 3:30 PM yesterday, the ship was towed to Ruirong, and the Maritime Bureau's Technical Section sent specialists to inspect the ship.</p>

<p>Resolved to Submit a Request to the Municipal Government for Review</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Government to specifically discuss the case reported by the Defense Corps Management Committee regarding the losses investigated by the corps in various districts and their request for relief. It was resolved that the request be sent to the Municipal Government for review.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Cause of the Strikes by the Loaders in Nanshi <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Responsibility of the Rice Merchants Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association stated that the Nanshi Rice Transportation Merchants Association had arbitrarily interfered with the loading of rice, causing disturbances at the rice wharves and leading to the arrest of loaders by the police, resulting in strikes and market closures by rice shops in Nanshi. Therefore, yesterday, the association convened an emergency meeting of all businesses in the north and south of the city. The association had built a rice wharf to facilitate the berthing and unloading of ships, which had led to the prosperity of the market. Recently, the Hunan Rice Transportation Merchants Association, organized by a group of boatmen from the same village, with Zhou Qiaosheng as the self-proclaimed chairman, has been arbitrarily interfering with the loading of rice on ships. He has been finding fault in every way. The Changbang boatmen protested because they were not from the same village. Zhou Qiaosheng became angry out of embarrassment and incited Mao Shenghe, an official of the Social Affairs Bureau, to lead three armed policemen with handguns and Mauser pistols to Wanxing Firm, looking for the owner. Despite the employees' polite persuasion, they left angrily. They then went to the Changbang boat and arrested Zhang Amao and Yao Heshang, loaders from the Xuxingcheng Firm and Hengxingxie Firm, respectively, without asking why. They were sent to the First District Branch for detention, causing all the loaders to stop working and the rice shops to effectively close for two days. Upon learning of this, the fellow traders were outraged. Considering the harm to all fellow traders, they decided to send representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to explain that the boatmen's association was disrupting the wharf and that the Social Affairs Bureau officials were abusing their police powers, arousing public anger and causing strikes and market closures. They requested sanctions. The loaders were arrested for no reason and sent to prison without bail, like sheep or pigs, with no regard for humanity. They demanded effective protection of human rights. If there is no satisfactory solution, they are unwilling to work and load rice. It is reported that if there is no effective protection plan by evening, it may cause public outrage in the northern rice industry and expand the unrest, which is not conducive to the well-being and security of the people.</p>

<p>Yuyuan and Chuxin Factories Suspended Work Yesterday</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau's Mediation Still Ineffective</p>
<p>The labor dispute in silk factories has been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau several times, but without success. Yesterday, the Yuyuan and Chuxin factories temporarily suspended work, while the female workers in the Hongkou district factories remained on strike. The factory owners have decided to attempt to resume work on the 9th. The Silk Factory Owners Association held an emergency meeting, with details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e186">Two Factories Suspended Work <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Yuyuan Silk Factory on Guoqing Road in the Chinese area and the Chuxin Silk Factory on Manzhou Road did not open yesterday. According to the labor representatives, the workers went on strike again because their demand for higher wages had not been met. However, according to Qiu Zhongcheng and Cheng Niansong, the managers of the two factories, speaking to the Dagong News reporters, after the factories resumed work, there were always people inciting and preventing workers from working during work and after-work hours. The factory was deeply afraid of accidents, so it had to suspend the factory. Now, after the persuasion of the Industry Association, it was decided that the factories will continue to open tomorrow (that is, today) to maintain the livelihood of the female workers.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Hongkou Situation <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the female workers in the Hongkou district factories were still on strike. The union, in addition to submitting it to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation according to law, has not made any other statements. The factory owners convened a small group meeting of factory representatives at 9:00 AM yesterday and unanimously resolved to implement the resolution of the Industry Association Congress, which is to attempt to resume work on the 9th uniformly. If the female workers remain determined not to resume work, they will be sent back and paid their wages, and the factories will be opened. Zhang Peishen was appointed to report to the Industry Association and submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>The Silk Factory Industry Association, following the instructions of Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened an emergency meeting of the factories at 2:00 PM yesterday. The attendees included representatives from Yuangijifanghang, Dada Wang Zhiyuan, Yulun Cao Zhongqing, Dingji Cai Zenghao, Hengyuxiexihang Silk Shouming, Tianyi Mo Yongqing, Xiangfengxuxiang Gold Yusongyuan He, Lu Yuanhu Zizhang Yun, Shengjingfeng, Cheng Niansong, Renguoying Zipei, Tongchangtai Chen Mingshan, Yichang Huang Fulin, Jiatai Zhang Chucai, Fufu Zujinrong, Fuxing Shen Boquan, Zhenxing Wu Qiujiang, Yichang Ersan Wang Rongxuan, Yichang Sisi Cheng Dao, Hongda Cheng Ruzhan, Tongyi Tang Bingqian, Heji Xin Zhou Chengmei, Yufeng Wang Shaochang, Ruihe Zhang Qiling, Chengxi Yao Ziyun, Yifeng Sheng Zishuiqi, Gongji Sun Longji, Xiangcheng Zhang Peishen, Yongji Yuan Bingzhang, and Standing Committee members of the Industry Association Shen Huachen, Zhu Jingzhu, Huang Jinfan, Sun Rongchang, and other 37 silk factory representatives. 31 people attended the meeting, chaired by Shen Huachen. He reported on the situation of the appeal to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, as well as the questioning and persuasion of the factory owners by the Bureau to make concessions. Zhang Peishen, the General Representative of the Hongkou District, reported on the small group meeting's decision to attempt to resume work on the 9th and requested that it be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. Then, three resolutions were discussed and decided as follows: (1) To abide by the labor-management contract signed at the Social Affairs Bureau on July 8 according to law. (2) According to the previous Congress decision, to allow the Hongkou District to attempt to resume work. (3) During the validity period of the contract, any conditions are difficult to accept, and the representatives were not elected Shen Huachen, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Peishen, Zhu Zhuxian, Tang Bingqian. The five people went to the Social Affairs Bureau to reply and explain.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Mediation Again <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>After the Silk Factory Industry Association adjourned the meeting, the five representatives led by Shen Huachen went to the Social Affairs Bureau to meet with Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section, and explained the resolutions of the meeting. At the same time, the labor representatives were also sent to the bureau to wait for a reply, including Yang Shumei from the Third District, Le Xiaorong from the Fourth District, Yang Gendi from the Sixth District, and Yan Aizhu, etc. After Wang Xianqing explained the situation of the factory owners' report to the bureau to the labor representatives, he repeatedly mediated and persuaded both parties with all his strength. However, both parties maintained their attitudes and there was no result.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Department Approved the Case for the Union to Stop</p>
<p>Because Shop Assistants should Join the Industry Association</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated in a letter from the Grocery Trade Association that it is legally impossible to organize a union in the grocery industry, and the preparation committee of the union is forcibly registering shop assistants, which violates the Industry Association Law. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce then submitted it to the Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Department and requested that it be reviewed and stopped. It is now known that the Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Department has approved the Chamber of Commerce, with the original text as follows: "Noted. After investigation, the employees in the grocery industry, except for shop assistants who are the users, should join the Industry Association. The clerks and labelers are indeed formal workers and can legally organize a union. The China-owned shop assistant's participation in the preparation committee is due to the fact that the committee's preparation is just beginning, fearing that workers' knowledge is limited, and especially ordering those who are familiar with the industry to assist in the process. When it is formally established, they will be properly separated and retired. Therefore, except for the forcibly registering shop assistants, the Union is ordered to stop the preparation committee. This is the approval."</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Cooperative Movement in China <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>It is undeniable that China has been weak and humiliated in recent times. However, reformers either cling to theories and specialize in empty talk, not knowing that most of the chaos stems from foreign economic aggression, leading to the bankruptcy of rural areas and widespread famine. It is indeed not easy to demand that people facing hunger and cold devote their energy to patriotism and resisting violence. Therefore, the current plan to govern the country must focus on the fundamentals, which means stabilizing the lives of the majority and guiding the economic development of the entire population. In other words, it should start with promoting the economic well-being of farmers. After all, we are a country founded on agriculture, and farmers account for more than 80% of the national population. If farmers are secure, bandits will be subdued, and then we can achieve prosperity and strength. However, to assist rural areas, it is necessary to first solve the issues of insufficient arable land, low agricultural output, underdeveloped side businesses, and lack of capital. To solve the above problems with a consistent policy, there is nothing better than promoting cooperation. The cooperative system can stabilize prices and improve living standards when applied to consumers, and it can improve technology, develop finance, eliminate the oppression of middlemen, and eliminate the separation between cities and villages when applied to producers. Its ultimate goal is to link producers and consumers, eradicate the bad habit of profiteering, and develop capital without concentrating it in the hands of a few. This is essential for discussing fundamental issues in China today. The promotion of cooperation in China has been going on for years. The annual meeting will soon be held in Suzhou. Therefore, I am writing this article to briefly describe the process, so that those who are concerned about the foundation of the country can gain some insights.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, scholars have recognized the importance of cooperative enterprises. The first to advocate for it was Xue Xianzhou from Xiangshan, who founded the Common People's Society in 1918, which was the earliest organization in our country to promote cooperation. At that time, the influence was such that a trend was started. However, due to the lack of opportunity, it gradually started and stopped. In 1927, when the National Government was established, members of the Central Committee, Li Shizeng, Chiang Kai-shek, and Chen Guofu, suggested to the Central Government to promote cooperation. At that time, the cooperative movement flourished. Chen Guofu, Wang Shiying, Sun Shoulun, Shou Miancheng, and others organized the Chinese Cooperative Society to research theories, promote movements, guide facilities, and investigate businesses. It was established in Shanghai on December 22, 1928. In the past four years, not only has its own business made great progress, but also the cooperative businesses throughout the country have benefited from the support of the society. At the beginning of its establishment, it edited and published the "Cooperative Weekly" as an attachment to the "Republic Daily" in Shanghai. Although only a few members of the society wrote it, it also attracted the attention of the society. When the society was established, it further edited and published books. However, at that time, there were only 22 members.</p>
<p>At the same time, the society entrusted Chen Zhongming, a member studying in France, to investigate the cooperative businesses in the four countries of England, France, Denmark, and Czechoslovakia. Chen returned to China in the autumn of 1929 and wrote "A Study of European Cooperative Businesses". At that time, the society had already started a monthly magazine, initially managed by Hou Houpei, and later by Wang Shiying. Cheng Jingjun was responsible for news and reports. A series of books have also been published, as many as thirteen kinds. Important books on Chinese and Western cooperative businesses are also collected. Since then, researchers of cooperation in the country have had a center to develop theories and implement them, and the fact that the domestic cooperative movement has made overall progress has also been developed as a result.</p>
<p>Recently, the society has also communicated with cooperative organizations in various countries in order to seek assistance. At the same time, Chen is in charge of the investigation department, and conducts on-site investigations of rural economies and existing cooperative organizations in various provinces, in order to implement them step by step. At that time, the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Zhili, and Hebei received economic assistance from the provincial governments and Sino-foreign charity organizations. Farmers also tried cooperative organizations. The society first started the investigation from the four provinces. After two years, it was able to achieve the expected goals. During that time, Chen's trip to Hebei Province was with Hou Zhezang. The society, with the powerful evidence of theory and practice, has been more determined to carry out its business. In October 1930, it convened a general meeting of members in Hangzhou to announce the implementation plan of the Chinese cooperative movement. The plan was appropriate, but most of it relied on government facilities. In recent years, there have been domestic and foreign troubles, and the country has been troubled, which has been delayed. However, the society has not slackened in the part that it can do. In March 1931, it re-established the training class for cooperative staff in Nanjing, strictly defined the admission qualifications, and provided practical guidance. It took six months to graduate, and the employers were satisfied with the hired graduates in various places.</p>
<p>The society has also entrusted Jiang Ji as a resident officer in the United Kingdom, so as to closely connect with the International Cooperative Alliance and the British Cooperative Federation. Then, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture sent a letter to the society to preside over the cooperative affairs in Wu County, an experimental area. The society first recommended Wang Shiying and Chen Zhongming to negotiate the regulations of the experimental area with the Department of Agriculture, and then recommended Chen Zhongming, Li An, and Hou Houpei to be responsible for the cooperative organization and business technology guidance in the area. At that time, the director of the area, Hu Changling, worked hard, so the results were very satisfactory. In the autumn of 1931, the society re-established the Cooperative Issues Discussion Group to specifically study the problems that arise at any time in the implementation of domestic cooperation. Although it is not easy to gather the members who are scattered, but because of the vast area of China and the great differences in the situation, there are many things that need to be studied. This kind of specialized gathering is indeed a necessary facility.</p>
<p>In view of the increasing development of the cooperative business in our country, it is necessary to organize a joint association to engage in cooperative trade. Therefore, a Chinese Cooperative Wholesale Department was established this autumn to purchase quality goods on behalf of cooperative societies, or to sell products on behalf of cooperative societies, so as to form a formal cooperative federation step by step. It has not been long since its establishment, but the business is quite impressive.</p>
<p>In September of this year, the society felt that there were many cooperative businesses in various countries that could be used as a reference, so it raised funds to send member Peng Buzhu to Europe to conduct a thorough investigation of the countries that Chen Zhongming had not visited before, such as Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, for reference.</p>
<p>In addition to cooperative business, the activity of its members is also remarkable. Now the members are all over the north and south, and the administrative organs and public organizations of cooperative businesses in various provinces are mostly presided over by members. There are also 273 members, 10 kinds of publications in large series, 19 kinds in small series, 4 kinds of popular ones, and the monthly magazine has been published to the tenth issue of the fourth volume. The special issues on specialized issues, such as the Cooperative Implementation Issue and the Cooperative Legislation Issue, are of great value. The most recent Rural Economy Issue is dedicated to discussing the current problems of the difficulties, which can be used for the reference of the people of the country.</p>
<p>In terms of its organization, under the Executive Committee, there are four departments for publicity, research, investigation, and guidance (and now a General Affairs Department). There are currently seven executive members and three alternate members. The standing committee members are Chen Guofu, Hou Houpei for general affairs, Wang Shiying for publicity, Shou Miancheng for research, Chen Zhongming for investigation, and Zhang Yan for guidance. The society is now located in the Lishui Villa on Shangji Yexi Road, and its wholesale department is attached to the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank for convenience. Moreover, the society has purchased land in Nanjing, and if the society's affairs develop, it will build its own clubhouse, which can be expected soon.</p>
<p>The past four years of the society are briefly described above. In short, there are not many members and the funding is not sufficient, but it has been working on the cooperative business from ideal to implementation, from abroad to home. Meng Jin is commendable. Social people's livelihood and economy are the basis of the country. At this time when agricultural production is declining and people's livelihood is exhausted, the people of the country expect even more from the society to actively carry out the work and not disappoint the people of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Chief Wang Investigates a Recorder for Interfering in Lawsuits <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Recorder colludes with lawyers</p>
<p>Disputes arise over public fees</p>
<p>First Special Court concludes investigation</p>
<p>Commendable efforts by the court to rectify discipline</p>
<p>Huang Chengxie, a recorder at the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, is from Huzhou, Zhejiang, and resides at No. 345 Dong Tangjia Lane. He practices medicine. After becoming a recorder, he was assigned to the Criminal Simple Court, where he transcribed judgments every day when the court was in session. On the morning of May 27th of this year, before the court was about to hear the case of electricity theft by the China Hotel, lawyer Jiang Chiping received a phone call at his residence from Liang Bingchao, a translator at the Special Court (Liang and Jiang are good friends), saying that someone had entrusted him to appear in court for defense. Lawyer Jiang then drove to the court to meet Liang. It was a little after 8 a.m., and the judge had not yet taken the bench, but Zhang Deqing, the manager of the China Hotel, and Zhao, the hotel's inspector, were already waiting in the Simple Court. At this time, Huang Chengxie asked Zhang Deqing if the lawyer he had requested had arrived in court. Therefore, he pointed to lawyer Jiang and said to Zhang, "The lawyer you requested has arrived." The original lawyer Zhang requested was Jiang Yiping, and Jiang and Zhang knew each other. Logically, Zhang should have realized the mistake after seeing Jiang and not interact with each other. However, Zhang did not do so. He quickly approached Jiang, exchanged names, and learned that he was the client introduced by Liang. He immediately handed over a letter of appointment and had Zhang sign it. As soon as he finished signing, the judge opened the court. Therefore, Jiang and Zhang had no time to talk about anything else besides exchanging names. After the electricity theft case was concluded, lawyer Jiang requested 100 taels of silver from Liang for public fees that had been orally agreed upon when Liang introduced him. Liang said that Huang Chengxie had entrusted the matter to him, so he ordered Huang to ask Zhang for it. However, Zhang said that he had not entrusted lawyer Jiang. The person he asked that day was actually lawyer Jiang, who had already been hired. When he signed the letter of appointment, he was suspicious that lawyer Jiang might be representing Jiang because he did not have time to attend. He insisted that he did not want to pay. Later, after someone mediated, Zhang gave 50 yuan to Huang for transfer, and Liang transferred it to lawyer Jiang. However, Huang still thought it was not enough and often argued with Zhang Deqing, saying that no matter what, others had helped. Why should you cross the bridge and pull it down? If the public fees are not supplemented, gifts should be given as gifts. However, Zhang absolutely did not want to sacrifice a bit. The dispute has been going on until now, and it has not been resolved for four months. Recently, the matter was heard by Wang Zhennan, the chief prosecutor of the Second Branch of the High Court. He believed that Huang, as a court employee, interfered in external affairs, which was illegal. He secretly sent a prosecutor to the China Hotel twice, on September 28th and the 3rd of this month, to inquire about the situation and examine the important account books in the court. He then ordered the First Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office to investigate strictly. The Local Prosecutor's Office took Huang Chengxie into custody on the 4th. At the same time, Prosecutor Zhang Guang led the clerk and bailiff to Huang's house in Dong Tangjia Lane at 5:30 p.m. on the same day to search. A full set of opium smoking tools was seized, and a trial was held once. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, Prosecutor Zhang summoned Zhang Deqing, Jiang Chiping, and Xu Tongxiang, the current manager of the China Hotel, to continue the trial of Huang Chengxie. First, lawyer Jiang stated that he had received a phone call from translator Liang at home on the morning of May 27th and went to the Simple Court to meet Liang. He learned that the China Hotel had asked me to defend the electricity theft case and agreed on a public fee of 100 taels. Then Zhang Deqing signed the letter of appointment. Because the court was in session, there was no other talk except for exchanging names. I did not know Huang Zhang, but Huang was really present at the time. Then Zhang Deqing stated that he had gone to court that day and Huang had pointed him to meet lawyer Jiang. Lawyer Jiang ordered me to sign, and then I realized the misunderstanding. I paid Jiang a public fee of 50 yuan. Later, Huang came to order me to send gifts. Huang Chengxie confessed that he had told Zhang that lawyer Jiang had arrived because Zhang had asked about the lawyer that day. Later, Zhang sent insufficient legal fees, so he asked Zhang to send gifts. As for the confiscated smoking tools, he claimed that they belonged to his uncle. After the trial, it was announced that the investigation was over, and the defendant was returned to custody. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Indian murderer sentenced to ten years of hard labor</p>
<p>British Assessor General severely rebukes the murderer</p>
<p>A case in which Indian watchman You Sha of Lizhong Lane stopped three tenants, Hong Kaifa, from moving and stabbed Zhou A Yu to death was re-tried by British Assessor General Grahame after separately hiring jurors. The trial was completed yesterday afternoon, and You Sha was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and hard labor. According to this case, after questioning the testimonies of both parties in the past two days, the court opened yesterday morning, and the prosecuting inspector and the defendant's lawyer debated the case. The Royal Inspector Mo Su summarized the testimonies and said that although the defendant claimed self-defense, he stabbed a person who had no weapons in his hand. If he claimed self-defense, he must prove that he had tried his best to avoid giving a fatal injury. Then the defendant's lawyer, Livingston, defended, still claiming self-defense, saying that the defendant's cane was held by the deceased, and he was afraid that his physical safety was in danger. After the debate was over, the jury retired to discuss, and immediately declared that the defendant was guilty. Then Assessor General Grahame sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>When Assessor General Grahame announced the verdict, he also said that the criminal had injured a young man who was only 21 years old. The jury's verdict was very lenient. The Assessor General severely rebuked the Indians for abusing sharp weapons and strictly ordered that this should not happen again in the future. After this punishment, he hoped that the same crime would not happen again.</p>

<p>Catching bed bugs caused a fire</p>
<p>The old woman insisted on not escaping and lost her life</p>
<p>At about 4 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 923 and a half Taile Lane, Gordon Road. The fire was very fierce at the time, spreading to the floors of the two neighbors on the left and right, and burning to death an old woman, Zhang Kong, 58 years old, who lived in the front building of the house with her daughter-in-law, Zhang. Her son was working outside, so he did not stay at home. Recently, the old woman was sick and lying in bed. Yesterday morning, the old woman felt strangely uncomfortable and suspected that there were bed bugs. She took a foreign candle and caught bed bugs around the bed before dawn. However, a sick person was weak, so she fell and the candle burned on the tent. When her daughter-in-law woke up from her dream, she quickly got out of bed and saw black smoke filling the room. She planned to escape with her mother-in-law, but the old woman insisted on not agreeing. Her daughter-in-law escaped alone and woke up the four neighbors. Later, someone reported that the fire brigade immediately drove the leather belt car to the scene and put out the fire. However, three houses had been burned down. The body of the old woman was dug out by the earthwork. Her head and face were burnt and her intestines flowed out. The situation was very miserable and unbearable to see. The Putuo Road Patrol House ordered the detectives to investigate. The body was carried to the Shuanglun Road inspection office. Yesterday morning, Zhang Lin Guang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, came to the office to verify the body. According to the testimony of the corpse's daughter-in-law, Zhang, when she saw the fire and the black smoke was very thick, she planned to drag her to escape together, but she resolutely refused and could not be rescued. Zhang got the testimony, and then announced that Zhang Kong, a dead woman, was verified to have been burned to death by fire during her lifetime. The body was handed over to her daughter-in-law to make a settlement for the coffin.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Minhang Ferry on Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Completed <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway will be officially opened after the Double Tenth Festival. However, due to the large-scale bridge construction project in Minhang Huangpu, it has been decided to use ferries temporarily. The ferry was designed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities on behalf of the National Economic Commission. The first design by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities cost about 50,000 yuan and took about half a year. However, due to the funds and time not being allowed, it was redesigned. It is said that the first designed ferry was a two-way type. Cars can drive into the ferry from both ends. From the bow to the stern, it can hold five or six cars. The second designed ferry is smaller, 15 meters long, 5.5 meters wide, and 2 meters high, with a draft of 1 meter. It is equipped with a diesel engine with an actual horsepower of 50 horsepower. It can travel 5.5 nautical miles per hour. The machine costs 11,636 yuan and was purchased from Qianxin Foreign Firm. The hull costs 13,700 yuan and was built by the Hexing Machine Manufacturing Factory. It was completed and delivered on the 1st of this month and has been tested in Minhang.</p>

<p>No need to install direction indicators</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities believes that the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway will be opened to traffic on the Double Tenth Festival. It is said that the Hangzhou Municipal Government requires all cars traveling in the city to be equipped with direction indicators (that is, to indicate the direction when the car turns). However, Shanghai cars do not have this kind of signal device. It is deeply feared that it will hinder communication after arriving in Hangzhou. Therefore, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration was entrusted to negotiate with the Hangzhou Municipal Government. It is learned that the Hangzhou Municipal Government has agreed not to crack down on cars coming from Shanghai that are not equipped with various Hangzhou city signals.</p>
<h3 id="e200">A sub-defense office established in Paotai Bay <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, heavy troops were stationed in Paotai Bay, Wusong, because the place was an important pass and had to be strictly guarded. Since the agreement was signed to destroy the fortress without leaving any trace, there are now only thirty or forty soldiers in police uniforms stationed there. As for local defense, there are now only the police of the Seventh District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Second Platoon of the Second Team of the Wusong Defense Corps stationed there. It is learned that the residents there are mixed with foreign residents after the war, and it is inevitable that bandits will mix in. It is deeply feared that the good and the bad are mixed, and the local defense is very important. Therefore, they jointly submitted a request to the Wusong District Defense Corps a few days ago and obtained the approval of the Shanghai Defense Corps Consolidation Committee to establish the Second Sub-Defense Office of Paotai Bay in the area. Sun Shaoce was appointed as the director to take charge of local defense matters. Director Sun took office immediately after being appointed. He has completed the inspection of the members and Ding under his command. Once the clothing and military equipment are sorted out, they can start the defense.</p>

<p>At 11 a.m. yesterday, various groups in the tobacco and wine industry in the city publicly elected Chen Weiwen, Chen Kunxian, Cheng Gengli, Han Xingwei, Chen Ruilin, Qiu Tanglin, Qian Wenfeng, etc. to gather at the south office of the Yandui Guild Hall on Fumin Road to collect the winter license tax entrusted by the industry. They were collected and taken to the license bureau on Nanchezhan Road to pay taxes and receive licenses. Qian Wenda, a representative, went forward and was received by Sun Shaoqing, the chief of the General Affairs Section. Representative Qian stated that the industry had entrusted them to pay the original amount of tax and asked them to collect the license. However, Chief Sun refused to accept the tax payment and refused to issue the license unless the two-yuan license was changed to four yuan. The representatives had no choice but to withdraw. At 5 p.m., they returned to the Ningbo Road Clubhouse and convened an emergency joint meeting of the nine groups. Chen Liangyu was publicly elected as the chairman to report the facts of the representatives' request for a license. Secondly, the method of discussion: 1) The tax bureau refused to accept the original amount of tax. The trade associations should convene a general meeting of members to decide on a response policy and should be consistent. 2) Report the situation to the tax authority in charge. 3) Ask the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Bureau, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to stop the forced collection of fees. 4) According to the statements of the members, the bureau does not collect the original amount of tax in the autumn. There is only a consistent shutdown. If the shutdown trend is implemented, it will inevitably expand and hinder social security. It is planned to publish a declaration in conjunction with the name first, and the rest will be omitted.</p>

He hoped that Mr. Chen would publicize it to the overseas Chinese and invest in the factory to make the capital strong. The happiness of the national industry and the future of the country depends on it. Then Wu Yingpei delivered a reply on behalf of Chen Wulie, saying that the Kangyuan Factory has a complete scale and developed business, which is commendable. I will do my best to publicize to overseas Chinese and invest in the motherland, in order to develop the national industry infinitely. Then Li Jishen gave a speech, saying that the development of the Kangyuan Factory depends entirely on the strict organization and legal management within the factory. The Kangyuan Factory handles everything according to the rules and in an orderly manner, so it is getting better and better. Xiang Kangyuan gave a speech, saying that the development of the national industry and the stability of the country are interrelated. Now that the politics is not on track, the national industry is affected everywhere, so the foundation of the Kangyuan Factory is like building on the sand, which cannot be called solid. Then Wang Yingbin gave a speech, saying that a few days ago, I was invited by Mr. Xiang to visit the factory and saw that the internal equipment was in good order and the whole was disciplined. It was really in accordance with the rules everywhere. Its business development is due to it. Now that the politics is not on track, running the national industry is like sowing seeds in the desert. If you carefully cultivate them, their prosperity will be the same as sowing seeds in a prosperous place. Now Mr. Xiang's Kangyuan Factory is the seed in the desert. Since Mr. Xiang has carefully cultivated it, its prosperity can be predicted. Before the movie was shown, the entire equipment of the factory was shown to help the rest of the show.

<p>The First Special Court Sentenced Him to Five Years in Another Case</p>
<p>Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective from the Old Zhabei Police Station, had previously learned that a gang of bandits was hiding at No. 504 Chongqing Road. On the 2nd of this month, he reported to Yu A’gen, the chief Chinese detective, and secretly went with Chinese detectives Chen Yonggui and others. They arrested Wang Zhaosheng from Hebei and Li Decuan from Shandong, and confiscated a pistol, seven bullets, and a bayonet. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court continued the interrogation. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that the police station is now prosecuting according to the regulations on prohibiting military firearms. An investigation revealed that the defendant, Li Decuan, is the son-in-law of Zhu A’jin, who lives at No. 231 Laohe Road. Li harbored resentment because his wife frequently returned to her mother's home in Ningbo. He recently learned that Li's father-in-law had over two hundred yuan in cash hidden at home, so he hatched a malicious plan and colluded with Wang Zhaosheng to rob him. However, they were caught before they could act. The police station found that on July 28th of this year, the defendant Wang Zhaosheng colluded with several other bandits to rob a cigarette paper store on Liyuan Road, near Xinqiao Road, in the city. Unexpectedly, as they approached the location, a police officer, Sun Jiming, attempted to search them. Wang and the others, seeing the situation was not good, immediately fired a shot, wounding Sun's left leg. A police officer named Zhang Hanchen happened to pass by and blew his whistle upon seeing the situation. Wang fired two more shots, hitting Zhang in the chest, killing him instantly. Sun's Mauser pistol was also taken by Wang and the others. Therefore, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has sent personnel to the case, requesting transfer. It is requested to rule accordingly. Subsequently, Shen, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, submitted an official document requesting transfer. When questioned, Li Decuan confessed to planning to rob his father-in-law's silver dollars. Wang Zhaosheng did not deny shooting the police officer from the Public Security Bureau, admitting that he fired the shots. Li Decuan hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and sentenced Wang Zhaosheng to five years in prison and Li Decuan to four years in prison. The pistol, bullets, and bayonet were all confiscated. Wang Zhaosheng was allowed to be taken away by personnel from the Public Security Bureau to be tried. After the verdict, they were sent back to this court for execution.</p>

<p>Ding Mingcai Sent to Court for Legal Proceedings</p>
<p>Ma Yuangui, a barber from Zhenjiang, 32 years old, and Ding Mingcai, also from Zhenjiang and in the same trade, 52 years old, were close friends. They had previously opened a barbershop in Vladivostok as partners. Later, Ma transferred his shares to Ding and came to Shanghai alone. He is currently working as an employee at the Yingji barbershop at No. 12 Yuxing Street, French Concession. Ding came to Shanghai from Vladivostok and arrived on the 30th of last month. He stayed at the Yixinli Tongyizan on Lao Yong’an Street in the French Concession, inviting Ma to play and stay overnight with him every day. Ding planned to return to his native Zhenjiang on the 5th of this month and asked Ma to accompany him to the train station. The two were very affectionate. For some unknown reason, Ding suddenly lured Ma to the alley of Yixinli on Lao Yong’an Street at 11:00 PM on the 4th, took out a sharp blade, and stabbed Ma nine times in the arms and abdomen, causing his intestines to spill out and blood to flow profusely. Ding immediately fled. Ma, wounded, fled to the Huangpu Beach of Xinkaihe. The police found him, took him to the police station, and learned the details. The police chief ordered him to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. These details have already been briefly reported. It is now known that detectives discovered Ding hiding in Room 37 of the Chunjiang Inn at No. 318 Shangrenli, Guangdong Road, Public Concession. They immediately went with Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession Police Station, arrested Ding, and brought him back to the police station. The next day, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. After questioning, Ding admitted to committing the assault and stabbing Ma. The court ordered him to be detained pending further questioning after the victim recovered from his injuries. Ma died of his serious injuries at 6:00 AM on the 6th. The court notified the police station and sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall autopsy room. At the same time, Li Weilong, the owner of the Yingji barbershop, telegraphed Ma Yuanqing, the deceased's brother, to come to Shanghai. Yesterday, Deng Baosun, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, and the coroner arrived at the location, confirmed the body, took their seats at the court table, and according to the report from the patrol officer, the official briefly questioned the deceased's brother, and then ruled that Ma Yuangui had died from stab wounds. In addition to the Police Department sending the defendant to court for legal proceedings, the body was handed over to the deceased's brother, Ma Yuanqing, to collect and bury.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item "Four Criminals Captured in Concession, Identified by Wu Guangzong's Family" on page 15 of your newspaper on the 4th of this month, there are some discrepancies with the facts. The criminal Yao Jiechen, who was captured this time, has long lived in Hongxingqiao, Changxing, and has committed numerous crimes, which are widely known. He is indeed significantly involved in the Changxing coal mine robbery. The other three criminals, Song Jiande, Wu Jigui, and Zhang Shaoliang, are also major suspects in this case. Our unit has been investigating and pursuing them for nearly a year, using all possible means. We finally learned that the criminals were hiding in Shanghai. On September 29th, we sent Detective Li Nianyun, along with informant Zhou Mingshan, carrying official documents to Shanghai. We first secretly monitored the criminals. At 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, we reported to the Laozha Police Station of the British Concession and, in cooperation with Chinese Detective Pang Yutang and Western Detective Los, captured Song Jiande and Wu Jigui, two Henan natives, at No. 89 Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road. They confessed on the spot to the whereabouts of the remaining accomplices, who were staying at Room 28 of the Xindahua Hotel on Fuzhou Road. We went to that location and captured Yao Jiechen and Zhang Shaoliang. Western Detective Los then found two Mauser pistols, two handguns, and thirty-nine bullets. The suspects and the loot were taken to the Laozha Police Station for temporary detention. On the morning of October 1st, at 9:00 AM, the suspects were transferred to the Special District Court, where they were interrogated by Judge Ma Shide of the Criminal Division, who ordered a week-long review. This is the actual situation at the time. We fear that rumors and misinformation will confuse the public, so we are sending this letter to clarify the truth and request that you make a correction promptly. We appreciate your cooperation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>On the evening of October 1st, the Qing Tian surveying ship, under our bureau's command, was anchored at the Bajiang Port on the Yangtze River, at 31 degrees 56 minutes 30 seconds north latitude and 120 degrees 14 minutes 10 seconds east longitude. At 10:30 PM, the Jiangyu merchant ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was sailing downstream. After stopping there to unload passengers, it switched to turning the wheel. It did not prevent the speed of the rapids flowing down, causing the ship's left side of the bow to collide with the Qing Tian ship's bow. Although the Qing Tian ship first unloaded the chain, it was too late. At the time, the ship's bow and stern lights were bright. Therefore, after the collision, the Jiangyu captain immediately admitted his negligence, filled out a certificate, and sent it to the Qing Tian ship as a basis for compensation. However, the Shanghai newspapers stated that the Qing Tian ship did not have its lights on, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. We are sending this letter in the hopes that you will publish it to clarify the facts. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Regarding yesterday's newspaper report that Communist leaders Hu Gongyuan and others were hiding upstairs in the Minmin Primary School at No. 469 Minhou North Lane, Hardoon Road, and were arrested by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, it is truly unfortunate. Tracing back to the afternoon of August 10th of this year, a Miss Chen, about twenty years old, and her friend came to rent a room, claiming that "her father works in the Nanjing Municipal Government and that there are three in the family, a mother and two daughters." They rented a vacant room and lived there for more than two weeks. A man, about forty years old, came to live with them. Upon detailed inquiry, the daughter replied "Father," with the name "Anshi," who was "working in Nanjing and has now returned to Shanghai for business." Unexpectedly, this incident occurred two weeks later. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the truth, we are stating the whole story and sending this letter to your newspaper, requesting a correction. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Hope of the Nation! <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Around the Double Tenth National Day, a special speech on the so-called "Hope of the Nation" was delivered.</p>
<p>China's only hope at present is truly patriotic youth! I remember Old Man Xiang met with the leaders of the Chinese Youth Party at the Leshan Hall and sincerely said:</p>
<p>"The current political stage in China lacks truly capable people. You are all young and strong, have studied abroad for many years, and naturally have a sense of the importance of patriotism! Moreover, you are willing to humbly learn and work practically! What can I say? Patriotism is based on love for others! Let me explain briefly, and I think you will understand. Because 'nation' is an abstract term, formed by the collective of 'people and people'; therefore, the people are the basic atoms or constituent elements of the nation.</p>
<p>You see the degradation of your compatriots and cannot bear to see them continue to be slaughtered. You call on young comrades to unite and save the country: this is the spirit of universal love and saving people! This is truly the so-called 'Hope of the Nation!'</p>
<p>In the past, autocratic emperors and militarists of large empires not only ate the people's offerings but also consumed the people themselves! They squeezed and sucked every drop of the people's blood. Their families, children, and wealth did whatever they pleased, harming both themselves and the nation! I ask: after you come to power, will you continue to act in the same way? If you do not love the people and the nation at that time, then it is better not to engage in this political business from the beginning!</p>
<p>You are humble and ask for my guidance, saying that you will still treat me with the respect of a disciple as you did a dozen years ago. Your virtue is admirable! I am old, and I hope that you will use your sincere love for others to strive to save the country. Like 'leaven,' you will succeed! I don't say much, but a little leaven, when added to three dou of flour, will quickly rise and expand! Hundreds of thousands of comrades can be spread across the country! The gospel of love for others is consistent, and the spirit of patriotism is the same: may you, lovely young people, remember this!"</p>
<h3 id="e249">Timely Words for the Double Ninth Festival <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Gai</p>
<p>Ascending Heights and Sending Wine</p>
<p>Ascending Heights: In the past, Huan Jing followed the instructions of an immortal. On the Double Ninth Festival, he led his wife and children to ascend to a high place to avoid disaster. When they returned, their house was indeed empty, and all their chickens and dogs were dead. Now, our compatriots in the Northeast are struggling and groaning in their devastated homeland, trampled by the iron hooves of the enemy. The people within the country are suffering from the slaughter of bandits in the interior and the infighting of warlords in the border regions. Calamities are everywhere, and there are refugees everywhere. How dangerous! If we don't ascend to a high place soon, we will truly be in danger of disaster. No wonder the crowns of important people can be found everywhere on the mountain tops even before the Double Ninth Festival.</p>
<p>Sending Wine: During the Double Ninth Festival, Mr. Jingjie sat facing chrysanthemums, with not a drop of wine in his pot. In this impoverished environment, a white-clad man carrying a jar full of wine came to deliver it. This is an act of giving charcoal in the snow, so it is no wonder that Mr. Jingjie got drunk. Our volunteer army in the Northeast is fighting for the glory of the nation and the victory of the country. Under the iron hooves, they are desperately fighting. How admirable and moving! But those who die in battle are indeed lying dead on the battlefield, and those who are captured will suffer the inhumanity of being beheaded by the puppet regime. I think that any Chinese with a little conscience will hardly watch them and the Northeast rivers and mountains perish together. Then the volunteer army lacks both bullets and food, and is in such a difficult environment. People of the country, be generous! If you have not forgotten the scars of January 28th, quickly learn from the white-clad man sending wine and donate some money to the volunteer army. Don't wait until after the country is lost, when there will be no money to donate!</p>

<p>Business with No Capital</p>
<p>Indeed, Shanghai is a world where gold is everywhere. Silver dollars are rolling around on the streets. Those who are fortunate have the possibility of enjoying them; those who are not fortunate will instead have their shoes pierced! Therefore, the past histories of many celebrities are often not very pleasant to talk about because they have sharp minds and a spirit of struggle, and have become lucky people.</p>
<p>But as of now, there are not many silver dollars rolling around on the streets, and it is very difficult to find them, so everyone is bound to panic. A friend said to me: "Now there is a business that will guarantee you make a fortune, as long as you hire a</p>
<h3 id="e251">Impression of Mr. Liu Haisu by Liu Yazi <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>I have known Haisu for six years, but I heard his name probably ten years before that. The model case of 1914 left me with the deepest impression. This was a conflict between art and etiquette, that is, a struggle between the emerging bourgeois consciousness in backward countries in the East and the feudal system that had already declined but had not yet been completely eradicated.</p>
<p>In 1927, I met him for the first time in Inokashira Park outside Tokyo, Japan, but we were both living a life of exile. At this time, the authorities probably thought that my thinking was too left-leaning, and that I was some kind of suspect; and for Haisu, they thought he was too right-wing, and added the title of academic warlord. It's so difficult to be a person, isn't it? We laughed as soon as we met. So we talked about politics, literature, Fielun, and Manshu, with great interest. After drinking, I wrote two poems and sent them to him:</p>
<p>(1) Meeting overseas is extraordinary, after ten years of fame, we are both old and weary. A volume of Fielun's collected works is there, and we talked about Su Lang, the wild goose and the departing geese. (2) The white-clothed man sent wine to Tao Yuanliang, and Zao Mao lived in the Yi Guan Youan. A smile advises you to shut up, the chickens and dogs in the world are all south of the Huai River. A few days later, I went to the Asahi Shimbun to visit his solo exhibition. Haisu's works are great, and I don't need to introduce them. What I paid special attention to that day was the inscription on his works, from Kang Changsu, Le Ren'gong to Hu Shih, Guo Moruo, almost like a list of modern Chinese celebrities. My favorite one had a sentence by Moruo, and the content was truly magnificent. You want to match Moruo's bold and strong poetic writing with Haisu's majestic and broad sketches. Isn't it the best in the world? The impression of this day was simply overwhelming.</p>
<p>After I returned to China in 1928, my contact with Haisu became sparse. Haisu went to Europe in 1929 and traveled to France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and other countries. It was not until 1931 that he returned to Shanghai. His progress in the past three years is of course limitless, but his attitude towards people has not been arrogant. On September 4, 1932, his nephew, Liu Shi, held a solo exhibition at the China Art Society. I went to visit, and he and his wife, Ms. Zhang Yunshi, both came out to greet me warmly. This kind of artistic family harmony is very likely to win the warm sympathy of the general public.</p>
<p>Now, the municipal government wants to host an exhibition of his European works. In order to print the garden from memory as a memorial, I wrote a preface on it for Suwo. Writing a preface is not an easy thing, especially since I am a complete layman when it comes to art. However, my history of meeting Haisu overseas is an unforgettable one. I will write this impression as a preface. The talks about the Buddha's head being dung are of course inevitable. Haisu will consider whether to use it or not.</p>
<p>Shanghai, September 27, 1932</p>
<p>partner, and you don't need much start-up capital or decoration. The best thing is that the hired partner doesn't need a salary, doesn't need to eat, and there is no risk of a strike. Where in the world is there such a good business!" I was very surprised when I heard this. That friend said: "Don't be surprised, isn't opening a Buddhist shop the best business in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Later, I thought about it carefully, and this sentence is not wrong at all. In addition to the so-called "Lower Court" and "Branch Court" in Shanghai, there are also many "Buddhist Shops," inside which there are no monks, nuns, or Taoists, but only a statue of a Buddha! This is the partner acting as a facade. The owner of the Buddhist shop must have a master, such as Huatuo, Huang Shigong, Han Xiangzi, Zhang Guniang, Lord Cao, etc. The master often drills into the owner's belly. Treating diseases, practicing spiritism, fortune-telling, communicating with the dead, asking about good and bad luck, and even national events and Sino-Japanese negotiations can be predicted. When the master comes, the owner yawns greatly, cries and drools, and behaves ugly, which is both annoying and funny.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law in the attic lost the flower meeting, and unintentionally heard someone mumbling and saying in the vegetable market while buying vegetables: "Lord Cao is really effective! Yesterday he said to open 'Zheng Bide,' and it was indeed correct. I won thirty yuan." Two people on a certain bus were talking loudly, gesticulating and saying: "The Huatuo Altar in XX Li X is really effective in treating diseases! My brother has been blind for five years, and both Chinese and Western medicine can't cure it. Who knows, the altar prescribed a prescription, and after eating one dose, his blind eyes became bright eyes." Another person echoed: "That's right! That's right! I had hemorrhoids for ten years, and they were also cured by Huatuo Patriarch. Therefore, Chinese medicine in Shanghai is unreliable, and Western medicine is also unreliable, because 99% of them are charlatans. When we are sick, we should still go to the Huatuo Altar and rely on the Bodhisattva!" The passengers in the bus seemed to agree with each other. I got off the bus and thought while walking: "The Buddhist shop owner's publicity work is really admirable!"</p>
<p>Brief News: Mr. Zhang Zhenlü gave up his career as a writer and has been engaged in manufacturing Liangchen stationery for eleven years. However, his cursive calligraphy has progressed along with his manufacturing business. Now, in order to form a relationship with calligraphy, anyone who pre-orders or buys stationery and envelopes for more than ten yuan from Liangnong Haoyoushe at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road before the Double Tenth Festival will receive a preferential discount and a five-foot couplet in Zhang's cursive script. Transactions over thirty yuan will receive a five-foot couplet in Cheng Menxue's Wei stele style in addition to Zhang's couplet. The exhibition period for foreign cities is ten days. You can obtain a sample of stationery and envelopes by paying one dime.</p>

<p>Then the two entered the English Clothing School. Tong Yizhen still attended the clothing class from 8:00 to 10:00 as usual, and Lu Boqin also took care of everything from the side. However, the two people's moods were entangled by this serious problem. Yizhen's heart was in a mess, and she couldn't focus on her books at all. Boqin was even more distracted and forgetful, and even forgot that he hadn't eaten dinner because he was hungry. After the class, Boqin still quietly sent Yizhen to the quiet alley. Under a dim street lamp, Tong Yizhen had been sullen and depressed for a long time, and had prepared some cautionary sentences to give Boqin a strong heart injection and a stimulant. "Are you sure you're going to Wan Quan tomorrow?" She asked firmly.</p>
<p>"I'm definitely going," he replied.</p>
<p>"Then, you don't have to send me. Go back to sleep quickly, don't overthink things, and especially don't be too concerned about the pros and cons. It's difficult for things in the world to have all the advantages and no disadvantages. If you think this matter is worth doing on the premise, then just boldly move forward and do it as far as you can. If you believe what I say, you will have a satisfactory answer to me tomorrow. I am eagerly looking forward to it." After she spat out these firm, steel-like words word by word, she strode away. But Lu Boqin was still hesitant and pondering as he went home, with no excitement or excitement like a warrior.</p>

<p>The next day, the two young men and women were indeed found in Wan Quan Park. This Wan Quan Park is located in the southeast corner outside of Fanyang City. Tourists can reach it by exiting the city from the Dananmen or Dadongmen. It was originally called Wan Quan River, with several weeping willows and a stream of water, with a bit of Jiangnan scenery. Later, it was developed into a park, with small bridges, winding paths, flower beds, and thatched pavilions added to embellish it, making it the only scenic spot in Shenyang. That year, the authorities in charge of municipal administration intended to make Wan Quan more clean and refined. They drove away all the motley, multi-faceted tents in the style of Shichahai in Beiping, and only allowed clean tea seats to be set up. Wan Quan had a different kind of seclusion and fame, and became a place for civilized ladies to stroll and have fun.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Financial and Gold Markets Are Very Depressed <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations Limited to One or Two Leangs. Yesterday's Gold Mark Slightly Declines. The Situation is Extremely Flat. The market mostly hovered around 731 taels and before and after. The depression of the market is obvious. Because remittances also undergo monetary fluctuations and because the Double Tenth Festival is approaching, there is a customary holiday, so transactions are very weak. Initially, although the silver market fell sharply, the private telegrams did not change, and the forward prices rose instead. After the opening, the opening price was low, and then there was little fluctuation. Later, the market recovered slightly. It was said that the Central Bank had opened 210 bars of spot goods, priced at 31.75 taels, which were sold by Taikang Run. After that, there was a slight setback. In the end, it was flat, with a little more than 31 taels. The green city situation is as follows,</p>
<h3 id="e254">Low Opening Price, Then Extremely Small Fluctuations <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The November opening price was 730 taels and 7 qian, a drop of 1 tael and 1 qian. Only (before the opening of the goods, it was done at 34 taels, and then it fell to a little more than 30 taels). The big bars had fallen 16/3, and American silver was 1/8. The American flowers were mediocre, large and small. Then Zhifeng Yong entered first, which was 31 and a half taels. Hengyu Yifeng Yong and others sold out, losing 1 tael and 1 qian, which was 30 taels and 4 qian. Qin bought in again, recovering 9 qian, which was 31 taels and 3 qian. Later, because there were few receipts and payments, it dropped slightly by 2 or 3 qian. At 9:30, HSBC announced that the exchange rates had not changed. Then Hengyu Hongkang Yongyuan Maoyong Yuantai Senchang Yong and others came to sell, and the price fell to 30 taels and 3 qian. After entering, it seemed peaceful, fluctuating within 31 taels. The Dalian gang and Tong Taichang Hengxing Hengyu Hongkang Yongyuan Mao bought in, and HSBC Bank slightly absorbed, which was thrown out by the Dalian gang. The invested bars, Huabi absorbed 4375 in October US dollars, and HSBC absorbed 375, so people's hearts seemed good. At 10:30, a few coins were added. After a while, it was seen again at 31 and a half taels. After a while, Zhengjin issued 19.25 in December British gold, and Yu Mao Yong Hengyu and others sold. Only the Dalian gang entered again, but the market price fell again. From 10:30 to 11:30, there were only a few coins up and down. At noon, Yifeng Yong entered and exited again, and Yiyu came to sell, almost January US dollars Huabi entered 75 until the noon closing price was 30 taels and 4 qian. Then it was done for a small 2 or 3 qian, because Maoyong sold out.</p>
<h3 id="e255">The Result is Slightly Smaller by 7 Qian <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon market initially closed at 34 4 qian, with sluggish transactions. Then Xie Xing Yong Hengyu Yuan Xing Yong and others bought in, and the bank did January British gold at 3125, and HSBC sold it to Mumbai at 11/125, and then absorbed it, 125 this month. Especially since the Central Bank entered spot goods again, Qian Changxiang came to resist, and the price jumped by more than 1 tael, 2:30, and at 31 taels and 9 qian. But the exchange market was not good. The Japanese Bank came out with November US dollars, half a yuan, and Yu Mao Yong Tong Taichang and others sold, which reduced 1.23 qian immediately. At 3:10, it was 30 taels and 6 qian. After this, all parties had no corresponding transactions, all of which were sporadic, and the price fluctuated slightly by 4 or 5 qian. At 3:30, it was 31 taels and 1 qian. At 4:20, it was 30 taels and 7 qian. At 4:30, the closing price was 31 taels and 1 qian, a decrease of 7 qian compared with the previous day. It then rose by 3 or 4 qian again. According to the daily maximum of 31 taels and 9 qian, the minimum was 30 taels and 3 qian, a difference of 1 tael and 6 qian. The red bar was increased by 10 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e256">The Revealed Price is Mostly Pressed Down by 1 Tael <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Because the US dollar had not changed, the revealed price was still 800 taels, calculated from 70 taels to 68 taels. In the afternoon, it was 70 taels, and then 689 taels, which was about 1 tael more than the previous day. The registered price was 32 taels this month, 30 taels in November, and the water supplement was 30 taels. In the afternoon, it was 31 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e257">There is No Large Amount of Transactions <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>There are few transactions on the tree, because tomorrow (Sunday) and the day after tomorrow are National Day commemorative days, and the market will be closed for two consecutive days, so large households will not release receipts and payments to prevent fluctuations after the market opens. In total, Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanchun, and item hedging all entered. Yu Mao Yong, Yifeng Yong, Yiyu, and Yuantai all exited. Dadecheng and Hengyu had erratic entries and exits. In the afternoon, Yuanchun, Qian Changxiang, Wanxing, Yuanbiao, Richang, Yuanxing Yong, and Hengchang Yong all entered. Tong Dachang, Yu Mao Yong, and hedging all exited Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, Futaiheng, Hongkang Yong, and Yuhe, although there were not many, and the entries and exits did not seem complicated. The Dalian gang totaled a net purchase of more than 500, and the rumored exit was more than 300. The Guang gang was silent, and the amount of each number was about 14,000 bars.</p>

As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the exchange rates of both British and American currencies increased by 0.0625. The number of transactions was not as active as the previous day.

<h3 id="e266">New York Stock Market Sees Mixed Ups and Downs <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reported that on Thursday (the 6th), the New York stock market slightly rebounded at the opening, but then fell sharply due to the continued sharp decline in Canadian and Chicago wheat. Investor sentiment turned after the surge in precious metals. Short sellers took the opportunity to cover their positions, and prices rose again due to price support. As a result, individual stocks had mixed ups and downs compared with the previous day. Calculated, Outside Electric, American Telephone and Telegraph, Asia Nacon Da Steel and Mining rose 25 cents, Allied Chemical Pigment, Chase Bank, Pacific Coal Gas and Electric rose 50 cents, Citibank rose more than 1 yuan, Orluk Motors, Libbai Tobacco, and Rainu Tobacco fell 50 cents, and Case Agricultural Implements fell 1 yuan. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1.9 million. The Dow Jones figures are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The Label Yarn Market Is a Scene of Desolation</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is unusually desolate. The range of price fluctuations throughout the day is only within 5 qian. Both long and short positions are holding steady. Spot yarn on the market is increasingly quiet. All gangs have no intention to compete. Most discussions in the market are waiting for the release of the third estimate of American cotton before taking action.</p>

<p>The human label market opened with mixed ups and downs in American cotton. Transactions in the venue were rare. Prices for each month rose by one, two, or three qian. In the afternoon, prices for each month fell back by one or two qian. The total trading volume for the day was 5,650 bales. Sold out: Yishi 700 bales, Ruida 400 bales, and Huaiji 300 bales.

<p>The cotton market is slightly firm. American cotton saw mixed ups and downs, and private estimates put the average number at less than 11 million bales. It is expected that the future of American cotton will not see another major price drop. Therefore, new sellers are taking a wait-and-see attitude before the report is released. As a result, trading has come to a standstill, and the fluctuations are also flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was mixed due to both parties waiting for the government report. First, it was firm due to frost, and then it was weak due to profit-taking by the bulls. Futures rose or fell by one to three pounds per point, spot goods fell by five pounds per point, British cotton futures fell by three or four points, spot goods fell by seven points, Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by ten points, and Indian cotton was closed.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month tended to weaken and fall again, with the quoted price of foreign wheat falling by about three or four jiao. In this unfavorable environment, the market sentiment could not stand it anymore. Although it did not show excessive panic, the soft sentiment was difficult to hide. Therefore, after the opening price, the market gradually loosened. This decline was entirely natural and was not suppressed by large selling houses. By the time the afternoon market opened, investor sentiment had stabilized. Later, because several companies did not sell, some floating shorts covered their positions, and there were rumors that the government would intervene in foreign wheat again, so investor sentiment rebounded. However, the international situation is still not good. For example, Australian wheat shipped in January is only 5 pounds and 13 cents, and the combined price is about 3 taels, 8 qian, 2 fen, and 3 li. In this situation, there is little hope for the future. As a result, this month's price remained unchanged, November's price was good by 2.5 li, December's price was slightly good by 2.5 li, January's price was good by 2.5 li, and February and March's prices were good by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Wheat Market Is Weak and Soft <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, the prices of each month generally tended to weaken. The quoted price of foreign wheat continued to fall by a little more than 1 jiao and about 3 or 4 jiao. In this situation, investor sentiment was difficult to recover. Although there was not much selling of goods in each month, it was forced by the environment, and near and far terms naturally fell slightly. Soon, some domestic manufacturers had foreign wheat set up, and the flour market was difficult to sell, so there was a lot of hedging in the long term. Investor sentiment was more virtual. Observing the next step, with the gradual accounting of foreign wheat, the wheat market may eventually be difficult to revive. As a result, this month's price was slightly lower by 3 fen than the previous day, November to February were each slightly lower by 5 fen, and March was slightly lower by 4 fen. The spot wheat market is still firm because manufacturers do not know why they are still accepting it. Kaiyao Bay wheat is 3 taels and 5 qian, Shaoxing wheat is 3 taels and 4 qian, Mingguang wheat is 3 taels and 4 qian, Zhenjiang wheat is 3 taels and 3 qian and a half, to 3 qian and 3 fen, a total of 1,800 bales.</p>

<p>Erbang Asked Yuankes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation became more and more depressed. The sales of old rice are not as good as new rice due to the rise in popularity day by day, and there is no intention to ask. In the market, the existing rice supply is still as high as 700,000 pieces. The price drop in the market is also expected. Also, the authorities have decided to purchase British debt wheat, so both foreign rice and local rice have linked things. Rice prices still have the necessary steps, so the rural economy is increasingly dangerous and may even lead to many adverse events in business. Yesterday's foreign rice price for high-grade rice fell by 5 fen, and medium and sub-grade rice fell by 1 jiao. The whole city was sold by Ben Street for 300 bales at 7 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen to 8 jiao. Bobang bought 37 bales of the newly arrived Anqing machine rice for 10 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, the Russian Association of Cooperative Societies showed a strong interest in Gongxi green tea from Wusi and Tunxi. The city traded more than 1,600 boxes, and the transaction was quite prosperous. However, the selling price was one or two taels lower than before. The Zhenmei item remained sluggish in the market. Only Tongfu and Fushi firms had a slight purchase, and the rest remained on the sidelines. There were no major transactions for Zhenmo Pearl Tea and other items.</p>

<p>Insufficient inventory... Asking prices are relatively high... Transactions are difficult to be smooth. Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port still lacked the momentum of Huai Zhan. The prices of green factory Qianerjing from New York were still low, and the sales to France were still quiet. Only the demand for Shandong Huang factory Jingqing was still strong, and the inventory in Shanghai was insufficient. Shandong silk merchants asked for higher prices. Although the transaction was , Qianli entered B-grade top number 13 to 15 strips with 78.9 points of average Shandong Huang factory Jing 80 packages with a price of 160 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Association's declared price for No. 24 Granulated Sugar White, the high-grade goods were still called for 14 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen and a half, and the ordinary goods were 14 taels, 9 qian and 2 fen and a half. The market situation seemed to be similar, and the transaction was also rare. The Chao Gang number house declared a new shipment of hundreds of packages of Huanggang Qing at a price of 9 taels and 5 qian, slightly increasing by one or two qian. However, because subsequent goods were still arriving, the market situation seemed stable. The Jian Gang number house, Da Lai Huade and Da Yong, declared 200 packages of Zhang Diao Qing at a price of 10 taels and 6 qian. Due to the relationship of going to the market, the trend was also flat. Because the source of Jian Bing was insufficient, the owner of the goods telegraphed to increase the price again due to the increase in cost, so it was heard that the number disk had also tightened accordingly.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of Tong'an Longan by the two rounds of the previous ship Yingzhou and Qingnan, most of them are in the middle and lower grades, and the market is oversupplied, so people cannot help but hesitate.

<p>The newly arrived goods of 100-pound double-jointed American tinplate are suddenly seen to be prosperous. However, the egg factory business is sparse, and the purchase of the export gang is also small, so the exhaustion of the market is almost on par with the British goods. The market price is estimated at 28 taels per box. It is heard that the spot goods of foreign firms have been sold one after another in recent days, and there are not many in the market. Therefore, the market situation is very weak, and the market price is expected to continue to rise.</p>

<p>Recently, the spot goods of 35-pound thin factory tinplate have been very scarce, and the number of buyers from various gangs is relatively high.

<h3 id="e286">Obey the Central Government <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Who! Dares to say that not obeying the central government's orders is a crime, is treasonous, and should be subject to appropriate punishment, so no one dares not to obey the central government's orders.</p>
<p>In the Shandong Han-Liu dispute, Han Fuju said, I obey the central government's orders. Liu Zhennian also said, I obey the central government's orders. However, up to now, Yexian, Laiyang and other places are still fighting fiercely. Does the central government order the two to kill each other? But they all said that they obeyed the central government's orders.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Second Liu dispute, although not yet opened, but the mediation is feared to be hopeless. According to Liu Wenhui, I obey the central government's orders, and Liu Xiang also said, I obey the central government's orders. However, according to Liu Xiang's representative Fan Chongshi, the Sichuan incident has the possibility of war, and according to Liu Cunhou's representative Yu Yun, the Sichuan war is unavoidable. In the end, are the two obeying the central government, or are they not obeying the central government? Since they have obeyed the central government, why do they still want to start a war? Since they have not obeyed the central government, why do they always say that they obey the central government?</p>
<p>The four words "obey the central government" are indeed a golden signboard of "uniformity and non-discrimination" and "honesty to the old and young." The quality of the goods in the store can be ignored. The weaker party relies on the signboard of obeying the central government in order to obtain the assistance of the central government. The stronger party relies on the signboard of obeying the central government. On the one hand, it can prevent the central government from assisting the weaker, and on the other hand, it can get rid of the crime of disobeying the central government's orders. In the same obedience to the central government's orders, each has its own psychology, and each has its own effect. This is a wonderful method of "disobeying the truth and escaping the blame" in recent days.</p>
<p>This method, if used properly, can be handled in this way regardless of the matter. Although saying "so and so," in fact, it can be "not so not so." It is really a so-called "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat." Selling it to six villages is six villages, and what reason can be asked? Therefore, most of the recent store sales are like this. The Japanese organization of the puppet Manchuria is nothing more than using this method. That is, all the methods of being a human being and being an official are nothing more than this. The two Lus are wonderfully different. Spring sells it. Everywhere this can be found. Alas! Obey the central government's orders! Obey the central government's orders! So many sins in the sky are committed in your name! Literature and Art</p>

<p>— Wang Moxi</p>
<p>Public power and strong powers are invading, and the compatriots are still drunk and sinking. I hate the lack of power to throw a whip to help the danger, and patriotism is ultimately not a heart to turn stones. The tragedy of killing each other in the same room is staged, and the disaster of destroying the clan and exterminating the family is deep. The responsibility of the individual is coiled around the soul, and the sorrow is unbearable with tears on the clothes.</p>
<p>XXXXX</p>
<p>Sounds of war arise everywhere, and the rivers and mountains are still the autumn of the Han Dynasty. I hate the lack of power to cut through thorns and support the sky, and I often worry about falling to the ground. I only have the ambition to emerge from the cocoon, and I still envy Ma Yuan's flow in a shroud. Changying can be allowed to ask Zhong Jun, and the bald pen should be thrown like Ding Yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Glaze <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zhou</p>
<p>Ruan is a translucent thing. It is applied to increase beauty and make it waterproof. The method of manufacturing it is very complicated. Due to the limited space here, only the essentials are extracted and the operating procedures are described in order.</p>
<p>1. Pulverization of hard raw materials. The hard raw materials used in the glaze, such as quartz and feldspar, should first be made into extremely fine powder for application. There are two types of grinding methods: dry and wet. The dry type must pay attention to the dispersal of dust, which puts the operator in an unhealthy environment.</p>
<p>2. Mixing method. A. Fluxing agent. To make a glaze, first prepare a fluxing agent. Mix the ingredients according to their composition and mix them intimately. Then put it in a crucible, melt it into a liquid by baking at high temperature, and then take it out and quench it in water, or let it cool completely. It changes into irregular crystalline or solid shapes. B. Glaze grinding method. Add water and a suitable proportion of insoluble substances to the above-mentioned solvent that has been made, and put it in a stone ball crusher with a figure to grind it into an extremely fine slurry. The glaze is then formed. C. Composition. The following are the compositions of glaze for readers and those interested in ceramics to study. Fluxing agent Quartz 26 Boric acid 15 Lead oxide 1.9 16 Magnesite 11 Chalk 13 Glaze Fluxing agent 70 Feldspar 24</p>

<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The chemical formula of the above glaze composition is as follows. Three glaze application methods. The purpose of the already fired or unfired mud blank is completed by the following methods. A. Impregnation method. The object to be glazed is impregnated in a glaze of appropriate consistency to complete it. B. Pouring method. The glaze is poured onto the utensils to be glazed. C. Brushing method. Use objects such as brushes to brush the glaze on the utensils. D. Air pressure method. This method is the most popular method at present. Not only can the work be quick, but also the glaze can be made evenly thick. The method uses air pressure to push the glaze out from extremely fine holes. After exiting, it becomes a smoke and attaches to the utensils. E. Volatilization method. This method is made by the action of salt, metal and steam. That is, the action of salt and steam decomposes into soda and hydrochloric acid. The reaction is as follows:</p>
<p>2NaC1+H20=Na20+2HC1 In this way, steam and hydrochloric acid each escape, and the remaining soda then combines with the silicic acid in the mud blank, which is a bright salt glaze on the utensils.</p>
<p>Finally, we must pay attention to whether the expansion and contraction force of the mud blank and the glaze is consistent. If they are not consistent, the applied glaze will inevitably expand or contract and crack. If the expansion and contraction force of the glaze is greater than that of the mud blank, then the amount of aluminum oxide (AiK ll) must be reduced and boric acid must be increased, such as the basic silicic acid of the aluminum oxide class. The largest expansion and contraction force of each raw material is aluminum oxide (NA20=100, K20=8.5) (Note). The smallest one is silicic acid (S102=0.8) (Note).</p>

<h3 id="e290">Opinions on Improving "Sending Sentiments" <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Ci Min</p>
<p>The problem of sending sentiments has always troubled me. For the past few days, I have been thinking about proposing suggestions in this publication to discuss an improved approach with everyone. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zicai's great work was submitted and published in this publication before mine, which can truly be said to be "exactly what I had in mind." Humans are emotional creatures, so interpersonal interactions often revolve around "sentiment." When relatives and friends have joyous occasions or losses, it is necessary to express "sentiment" of congratulations or condolences to them. However, "sentiment" is inherently an internal spiritual function. How can I express this "sentiment"? How can I make relatives and friends sense or accept the "sentiment" I am expressing to them? Everyone feels that it is somewhat difficult to fulfill this task solely through "sentiment" itself. Thus, the practice of using tangible material gifts to express "sentiment" arose. Therefore, the problem of sending sentiments, as Mr. Zicai mentioned, has evidently transformed into a "problem of sending gifts" in the present day.</p>
<p>"A goose feather sent from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the sentiment is heavy." It should be understood that the quantity of gifts is by no means a measure of the weight of sentiment. Mr. Zicai said, "However, to express sentiment, grandiosity is not necessary," which is indeed true. However, in this society where the spiritual and material are separated, in a capitalist society where most people adhere to extreme "fetishism," the chain relationship between "gift" and "sentiment" is often broken in many situations. The phenomenon of gift-giving need not originate from "sentiment," and "unprovoked gifts" can be given to achieve certain purposes. Conversely, between parties with "sentiment" relationships, the phenomenon of gift-giving may not necessarily accompany it due to the driving force of "the whip of snobbery." There are many such examples, so I won't go into detail. Now, let's set aside these abnormal facts and discuss my limited view on improving this problem. In addition to agreeing with Mr. Zicai's opinion, I feel that two points should be added: First, the closeness of sentiment should be the criterion for sending sentiments. For example, if my long-time teacher dies, even if his family does not send me a notice, I should send sentiments to express my deep sorrow. Also, for example, if my teacher's grandparents or parents die, even if they send me a notice, I may not need to send sentiments, because there is no "sentiment" to speak of between me and those people.</p>
<p>Second, reduce the number of occasions for sending sentiments. Weddings, betrothals, funerals, and burials are major events in life. Sending sentiments for celebration or condolences is appropriate. But looking at the current occasions for sending sentiments in society, they are truly diverse and complicated, such as the completion of a new house! Or a son's birthday! And what else...! Layer upon layer, more and more. If sentiments have to be sent for everything, wouldn't we poor scholars be driven to death! For the sake of the general public, reducing the occasions for sending sentiments is even more necessary.</p>
<p>What do you think, Mr. Zicai? What do you think, readers?</p>

<p>— Zeng Yu</p>
<p>In the process of love between men and women, men often succumb to women. After marriage, women gradually succumb to men.</p>
<p>People who have received higher education are not necessarily all of noble character. People who have not received education are not necessarily all despicable.</p>
<p>If people can use the determination and courage of suicide to pursue any career, they are sure to succeed.</p>
<p>All evils in the world originate from a momentary mistake in people's consciences.</p>
<p>People who are good at scholarship and morality certainly obtain it from books, but some of the bad deeds done by villains also come from books.</p>
<p>When Chinese people have a skill, they want to show off their abilities everywhere. For example, those who understand law will use law to cite, argue, and explain when talking.</p>
<p>If young people can pursue learning with the perseverance and determination to seek love, their future achievements will be limitless.</p>
<p>When people yearn for something they have not obtained, their hope for it is very profound. But after they get it, they become indifferent and no longer cherish it.</p>
<p>When people are in extreme pain, they will not fantasize about everything in times of happiness. But when they are in extreme happiness, they should at least fear that sorrow is about to descend.</p>
<p>Those who test love are like the prospects of explorers, both are vague. At the same time, they are all praying for the development of new hope.</p>
<p>National crisis is like opium, it can only be tried once in a while, but the spirit is very exciting. Now the national crisis is so numerous that it cannot be counted, just like old addicts, even if they inhale a lot of opium, it is useless.</p>
<p>The fate of one's future is determined by oneself, and the same is true for a country.</p>

<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>—Listeners in the Auction—</p>
<p>Life is always so dry and dull, with no development to speak of, and my heart is already full of boredom. In order to breathe some new air, after lunch, I jumped out of my cage-like small room and slowly strolled to the northern part of North Sichuan Road, which is full of Cantonese flavor. This immediately reminded me of the Northeast under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism, and the people of the North under the infighting between Han and Liu. It seemed that the prelude to "foreign invasion and internal strife" was unfolding before my eyes. My footsteps stopped, and I was by the book stall at the intersection of Haining Road. Looking around, I found a copy of the "May 30th Special Issue" of the Oriental Magazine. I casually asked the hawker,</p>
<p>"How much is this?"</p>
<p>"Four dimes!"</p>
<p>"Is two dimes okay?"</p>
<p>"No, it's exactly four small dimes!"</p>
<p>In fact, even two dimes, I couldn't take them out at the moment, so I just glanced at the content and left. A few steps forward was the Hongkou Grand Hotel, which had a reputation for its sturdy leather. It was now heavily locked with iron gates, and the broken bricks and tiles, broken glass, etc., were piled up here and there in a chaotic mess. I remembered visiting a friend there two years ago. Because my clothes were too shabby, the gatekeeper kept looking at me with suspicion, meaning: "You are either a beggar or a pickpocket!" It really made me feel resentful. Seeing its current destruction, I felt truly happy! But then I thought of the Japanese soldiers' tyranny, and finally my personal grudges were suppressed.</p>
<p>I strolled slowly again, and a series of drums and music of the usual price reduction and clearance sales came from the front. It turned out to be upstairs in a certain company at the corner. The entrance was crowded with people, packed like sardines. Driven by my desire to sightsee, I also pushed my way in. The first thing I noticed upon entering was the four big characters "Beware of Pickpockets" posted on a large piece of glass. I instinctively touched the pen in my pocket, and luckily it was still there. So I felt relieved and started to look around: It was indeed a big sale, hats, clothing materials, silk stockings, cosmetics, everything was very cheap. Unfortunately, my pockets were "empty as a suspended chime," so I could only look around and watch others picking and choosing, their hands full. A Cantonese woman with long braids bought a bottle of Shiseido's Thousand Mile Fragrance for two small dimes, a bottle of Samsung brand cologne for one dime, and two pairs of long silk stockings for four dimes each, and walked away with her eyes glazed over. There was also a heavily pregnant Bai Xiang friend with particularly long sleeves, who bought a hat that originally cost four dollars for one dollar and put it on his head. Also, many people always came empty-handed and left fully loaded. It was truly a rare opportunity for cheap goods. It's just that those goods were all stained with mud and ashes, and wrinkled. It turned out that they were moved out hastily during the "January 28th" incident, so they became like that! Dirty and wrinkled, so they were being auctioned off cheaply.</p>
<p>I think anyone with a little bit of conscience would be able to tell that those goods were not just mud and ashes, nor were they just wrinkles. They were all the tears of our compatriots, the blood of the soldiers of the 19th Route Army! Each customer who bought cheap goods should know that this was a gift from the Japanese soldiers during the "January 28th" incident! How should we thank them! Repay them!</p>

<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In this year of tragic and painful national crisis, whether young or old, everyone should be filled with enthusiasm and burning blood, holding guns and bayonets: charging and annihilating the enemy! Because, China, our motherland! Who would willingly watch their bright and lovely motherland sink and perish?</p>
<p>Is that so? Do the people of China all have such majestic aspirations and steadfast will? Friends! Hold on, let me tell you about a painful, sad, and infuriating thing I encountered during the national crisis!</p>
<p>Next to a wide road in western Shanghai, a solemn and magnificent X Church stood tall. On this day, it was the day when their believers were holding a gathering for worship and prayer. A returned from a memorial meeting at school and asked me to accompany him to visit the atmosphere of the church commemorating the national crisis.</p>
<p>Four legs stepped onto the steps, and a yellow-haired, blue-eyed foreigner flashed out of the house to welcome us, and cordially invited us. So we entered the last row of seats. The hall was divided into left and right sides, with four or five hundred men and women sitting, including fashionable young people and young ladies, as well as rural men and old women with local flavor. But the atmosphere inside was always very quiet and full of solemnity and dignity.</p>
<p>"When the national crisis is at hand, we need to fight!" A Western-dressed young pastor stood on the podium, gesticulating and talking about his (doctrine), "But, when you are preparing to fight, first, you often think that the Holy Spirit is with you; second, you must carry the cross of Jesus; third, you should hold the Lord's honey example. Then, you</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Victory is certain, and the enemy's artillery fire and flesh will be defeated at the sight because your war is our Lord fighting for you, and our Lord is so noble and great, with authority and love for us! We should thank our Lord and ask him to be with us forever, and our country will naturally become prosperous and strong..."</p>
<p>Holding our breath and sitting like pins and needles, we were almost suffocating to death, but still patiently endured and continued to listen to this so-called (doctrine) for two hours. Finally, amidst the smiling farewell of the foreigners, we slipped out onto the road, deeply inhaling a breath of fresh air, as if prisoners had been granted amnesty and were seeing the light of day again!</p>
<p>"Damn it, Jesus has his own reasons! A"</p>
<p>He said to himself with a bitter face. Then, he clenched his fists tightly and shouted in grief and indignation: "Foreign slaves, running dogs, damned things! Giant demons that anesthetize life, living corpses with frozen blood! It's rare that he still knows that "the country is in danger", and it's rare that he still knows that "we need to fight", but the Holy Spirit, the sword, the cross... A series of ghostly talks and nonsense, our country will naturally become prosperous and strong? Will the enemy's artillery fire and flesh really be defeated at the sight? What is the Lord? Can he fight for us? Friends, anesthetized friends! Wake up, stop being obsessed with the non-existent "authority of God", please abandon your narrow-minded individual heroism, let us unite our masses, concentrate the power of the masses, burn with enthusiasm, hold guns, and bayonets; charge, and annihilate the enemy! Kill, friends, kill! Kill! Fight! China, China is our motherland!"</p>
<h3 id="e294">Nonsense <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>Five Mr. "Dare Nots" Meng Jian Mr. is a common title, and anyone dares to accept it; but the following five Mr. are those that some people dare not accept. Because someone dares not be a Mr., I say they are five Mr. dare nots.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Official The traditional ideology of a patriarchal society. Everyone is willing to be this Mr., but because Mr. Official often does bad things, some people dare not accept it. In fact, it is not that they dare not accept it, but that they cannot do it well or for long, and they express their unwillingness to accept it in their resignation letters.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Nanguo The ones who fill the ranks. In practice, there are many who dare to accept it, but on the surface, no one dares to accept it. So now, those who are referred to as Mr. Nanguo dare not accept it, and those who can be Mr. Nanguo are lucky.</p>
<p>(3) Little Mr. Little Mr. is another name for a child prostitute. Becoming one is the first step into the fire pit, becoming a plaything for men, becoming the dregs of society, simply becoming a person without freedom. Those who are little Mr. have no concept of daring to accept, it is entirely due to being young and ignorant and being framed by others. If they have a little reason, a little life skills, and can escape the shackles of good people, I think they will definitely not dare to accept it.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Guo This Mr. can be surnamed Guo, but people surnamed Guo will get angry when they hear it, thinking it is an insult, and they dare not accept it.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Illiterate Everyone has been a Mr. Illiterate when they were young, but when they grow up, they dare not accept it, because they are afraid of being embarrassed if they do. There are many Mr. Illiterates now, but how exactly can they dare to accept it? I'll talk about it next time.</p>
