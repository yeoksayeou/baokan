<h3 id="c1">郵資加價平議翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>據本報二十一日專電。交通部對於郵資加價不因反對中止。决於五月一日實行。事關文化前途及國民之負擔至鉅爰就管見所及與當局一商榷焉夫國家之設郵政其意義絕不在財政之收入而在溝通文化傳遞消息。爲全民服務誠如交次陳孚木氏所謂［代勞代辦］者也攷歷年郵。政得以經濟獨立不受國庫之津貼者要在制度嚴密職工勤勞全體一致有以致之否則内戰連綿。交通阻塞郵務之未至顛覆也幾希今者忽以郵資加價聞。豈眞郵政之本身亦有不能支持之象歟。</p>
<p>按郵資應否加價當視加價之動機據當局宣稱。此次郵資加價實因收入短少。支出増加收入短少乃天災外患之結果支出増加爲運費與薪工驟増之影響。其實據熟悉内容者觀察今日郵務之逐漸不振其根本原因由於郵政之獨立精神。近已漸見搖動從前郵務當局。堅守［郵政經濟專養郵政］之原則。故雖在惡劣之政治環境下仍得保持獨立。逐漸發展乃近年來。政府對於郵政改絃更張添辦非急需之事業増設駢枝機關徒耗財源。分割制席如航空郵遞與籌金匯業是也。</p>
<p>航空郵遞是否急需。乃一絕大疑問誠如交次陳孚木談話。吾國郵遞設備至爲鄙陋應用汽船者仍用民船應用車輛者。仍用步遞而窮鄉僻壤之間郵線之有待開闢者正多然則當局何不從此種切實之設備上謀逐漸穏健之發展而必設立此並不急需之航郵急急以求擴張即就已關之航郵路線而。言從郵務自身打算支出鉅而收效甚微。舉所有航郵收入盡給諸航空公司。猶嫌不足。復年協鉅欵塡補航空公司之虧損。以郵政本身有限之收入塡補非郵政範圍内之事業。此種挖肉補瘡之計劃自必有損於郵務經濟。而自身轉感困難。此爲郵務支出増加之大原因也。</p>
<p>至儲金匯業另設專局。一方面破壞郵政制度他方面驟増許多開銷而儲金匯業局之營業實况。當局亦殊有難言之隠。十九年度之報告。所謂盈餘鉅。欵據熟悉内幕者之調查實爲假定虚報之數。人言籍藉。僉謂因公債投機。受虧不少致向來郵務方面尚得以儲金匯業之盈餘爲挹注者今亦變爲畫餅充飢。此又郵務支出増加之一原因也。</p>
<p>是故今日郵務之不振由於當局之改弦更張。已可概見郵務職工。雖亦時有諍言。期當局之改善而當局在此環境之下勢不能不加重人民之負擔。以彌補其措置失當之影響今日人民責難之紛至。固亦無從避免者矣</p>

<p>希孟希望本週杪公開會議但目前尚無打開僵局氣象特委會下届會議亦無確期日本聲稱不出席特委會議　　國民社二十二日日内瓦電云國聯大會十九國委員會主席希孟今日聲稱渠希望星期六當可舉行公開會議惟會議遲早將繫於日本之答復現外間雖接有日本未必能贊同委員會態度之消息但國聯諸領袖以爲惡消息不宜預料仍希望時局能在和洽基礎上自行調整云</p>
<p>路透社二十一日日内瓦電云據今日消息日本與國聯間之僵局依然存在日代表長岡已接到東京訓令證實日本對於國聯特委會草案之反對日人現欲另换一種方案旣不大損於日本之體面又可使日本政府避免憲法上困難國聯現授權上海混合委員會决定日軍可撤之日期不間日本同意與否此舉乃主要障礙日政府依據固有習慣對於軍旅大事如撤兵等不能擅下命令或輕予許諾因此種特權屬於日皇也若混合委員會决定日軍在何時必須撤退而與日皇代表之意見相左則日皇將處於不可思議的卑辱地位矣惟關於撤兵事之條文係全案最扼要部份且係特委會於一再考最後始定稿者故目前尚未有打開此僵局之良好氣象</p>
<p>路透社二十二日日内瓦電云各國代表團對於中日爭案之僵局遲遲不能打開皆呈不安之象史汀生與希孟之談話歷一小時之久史氏關於十九國特委會所具之情感訊問綦詳兩政治家曾討論現局之各要點現信史氏曾表明美國所處地位能如何竭力贊助國聯所取之步驟日代表團已聲明不能接受如今日之决議案第十一條日某大員語路速訪員謂日本現力圖提出一較愉快之方案日本希望覔得脫離今日不幸局勢之途徑中國代表團堅拒删改所爭之條欵彼等並未參加任何非正式談判惟靜待十九國特委會之行動</p>
<p>路透社二十二日日内瓦電云美國務卿史汀生與國聯大會十九國特委員主席希孟今日會商中日爭案之僵局中日爭案之發展仍在停頓中希孟今仍候日本之正式覆文非正式之事務旣甚難辦又極繁雜十九國特委會下届會議在四月二十六日前不致舉行</p>
<p>路透社二十二日東京電云日本决計寗退出國聯而不願依允東三省事件適用國聯會章第十五條此已爲公開秘密今日據可恃消息日本對於十九國特委會辦理上海休戰談判之問題現亦主張不稍讓步日本從未承認特委會辦理茲事之資格且認特委會之干涉徒使此問題一時不能解决耳</p>
<p>電通社二十二日東京電云英代表西門與法代表等强國方面對日本與十九國會之正面衝突非常憂慮且將近五月之國聯總會日本若與小國衝突在日本戰屬不利因勸告長岡代表不若於十九國公開會議時出席披瀝主張曾由長岡代表來電請訓芳澤外相乃發如下之同訓並即於今日電達其回訓謂十九國委員會係根據日本在總會棄權决議所成立故日本不承認該委員會且小國之策動對日抱有偏見故無出席之必要照旣定方針進行須認明不出席之態席云</p>

<p>郭對使英恐不就</p>
<p>外交次長郭泰祺日前自京返滬停戰會議重開之說一時遂甚囂塵上卒以我方旣定方針須俟國聯議會特别委員會舉行公開會議通過關於日軍完全撤退期限問題之决議案後此間方能定期開會國聯特别委員會秘密會議所通過之决議案雖未確定日軍完全撤退日期但規定日軍須在最近將來撤退至一月二十八日以前原防該項决議案中確未提及［恢復平常狀態］字句祗稱撤退時間由上海方面之共同委員會决定共同委員會</p>
<p>中任何一造認爲該項時間已到即可召集會議取决大致已如報載我方業予接受現在關鍵仍在日本如日方同意則日内瓦方面今日可望舉行公開會議予以正式通過此間停戰會議下星期内亦可望重開詎知値此停戰會議將開未開</p>
<p>之際南京方面忽然决定郭泰祺調任駐英公使而以徐謨繼任外交部政務次長停戰會議我方首席代表遂又發生問題外間因起種種傳說郭之調任駐英公使或謂事前已得郭之同意郭對此認爲尚未接得政府正式命令不願表示去就惟據熟悉内幕者言此事尚有某種政治背景郭之使英恐未必肯就也至於停戰會議我方首席代表郭次長仍將繼續擔任以資駕輕就熟英公使藍溥森昨夜乘怡和公司公和輪船赴京本係預定惟郭次長昨夜亦臨時决定與英藍使同船入京故外間知者絕少郭氏返滬未數日今又赴京其任務半爲停戰會議問題半爲出使英國問題也美公使詹森夫婦則於昨日下午二時自京返滬昨晚七時英公使藍溥森美公使詹森邀郭泰祺參加茶會交換停戰會議續開意見至八時餘而散</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國難嚴重到如此狀態雖說民衆們有一大半已從睡夢中驚醒起來，在這存亡的刹那，圖最後的掙扎；但是徘徊歧途的也就不在少數，你看，擁兵自衛的軍人，惟利是圖的好商；倒行逆施的漢奸；以及傾向於喪權辱國的國賊他們都還在躊躇着！</p>
<p>我們痛定思痛，深感此番國難的發作，與其謂爲暴日侵略之因，毌密謂爲二十年來内亂之果，暴日兇横固然可根，倘使自家人不爭權利，不奪地盤，一心一德爲國防上建設了堅固的壁壘，敵人也會深入腹也扼我咽喉麽？已往的姑且不談，今而後全國同胞，應該齊向［和平建設之動］的大道上走。但所謂［和平］，是限於［對内［，而非［對外］，换名話說：［把槍口向外轉］，一致對付外來的侵略者；在這時期如此，即永遠也如此。怎樣實行［和平建設運動］？自然是極重要的問題。第一全國軍人應澈底覺悟，永遠不再參加内戰：第二國民整個組</p>
<p>織起來，督促［和平建設連動］。茲介紹劉湛恩君所擬的四個辦法，可供參考：（一）訂立國内非戰建設公約；（二）對於破壞國内和平參加内戰者採不合作主義；（三）奬勸建設領袖：（四）注重和平建設宣傳。除此之外，辦法當然很多，不過這四點，意義包括很廣，可以根據這意思，訂立切實有效的條例。譬如本届國難會議通過了一個國民代表會，上海方面，還有民憲協進會的發起，如果這兩團體眞要負起救國的責任，目前急須解决以下兩個問題</p>
<p>［實行武力抵抗收復失地］</p>

<p>聽音器近來因空軍發達。深感防空比什麽爲重要。想出種種防空器。以爲事前的綢繆。如空中聽音器。夜間探照燈。警報傳達器。情報器等。都受過去戰爭的經騐。逐一出世了。現在先從新兵器中的聽音器說起。這種防空器。是在世界大戰後所發明的。在大戰以前。偵察敵軍飛機。惟靠人的肉耳探聽。大戰時。因受飛機的蹂躪。無法預防。至大戰後。有一位法國人。首先創造喇叭型的受音器。裝在兩耳上。但這器的構造。對於水平角高低角都判定。因此没有多大的效用。後來改用爲四個。然而總没有十分準確。未幾發明抛物線型的空中聽音器比喇叭型稍爲進步。可是飛機駛行的速度很快。用聽音機以判斷方向時。其位置常常差異。乃再修正音波傳導的時間。其後賴電力的聯動裝置。六加改良。最著者爲美國斯配利公司所出的聽音器。是根據喇叭型所造成。很爲精密。自此以後。法國改良抛物線型造成内　的碗形聽音器。德國又就喇叭型而變成外開式似牽牛花形的聽音器。然以上各種聽音器。仍舊有利有弊。中間經過種種研究。復造一折中型。具有四角狹長而像箱子形的聽音器。製造旣然容易。效率又很宏大。但是這種聽音器。仍要用人耳探聽。而判斷方向。因左右兩耳的感覺。不能同一。且因精神的　動。總不能得到精確的效果。而且使用這器。應有相當的練習。究難應時代的適用。最近把音波代電流的變化。借電流計的指針作用。由聽覺得以精良辨明。又由視覺得以判定音源的方向。於是聽音器的效用。很爲偉大。日本現有换聽音器。爲大正十四年的喇叭式。此次滬戰。日軍曾在司令部領事館内。裝設防衛的。</p>

<p>— 王天恨</p>
<p>咳！危險！你是何時出來的，如何抛了老太太和雄兒！幸而我們住在一條弄堂裏，我逃出屋來，看見你家大門洞開着，便走進去關，正見老太太和雄兒站在客堂裏，唤你不應。唤娘姨也不應。我曉得不能再遲，就拉了老太太和雄兒出來，因爲弄口被炸，只得從後弄走出；剛剛出了弄，又聽得一聲爆炸，只怕我們的居宅都被炸燬了！危險！秦江說。［就是不炸燬，現在還能回去麽？趕快找個也方躲！］老母說</p>
<p>［我也來不及把我一夜的經過告訴你了，這裏還是危險，要我個安全之所，安頓了老太太　好！［他說。</p>
<p>［且逃出閘北，到租界去，］秦江很簡截地說</p>
<p>於是他也顧不得倦，覓路奔租界。又幸而秦江身邊帶了百十塊錢，　能趁渡船，渡過了蘇州河，大家方始定心，他也纔有機會把一夜的經過情形告訴了老母，老母又派定是祖宗默佑。他一說完，就繼續思量到何處去，身邊没有錢，住不得旅館；想了幾家親友，地都曉得住不下；還是他的連襟家裏，地方旣寛大，秦江又好同去。便和母親秦江說了。秦江很表同情，同樣的姊夫，再好没有。他的母親却有點不願意，可是也顧不得許多了！到了連襟家裏後，大家心上的一塊石頭，纔完全放下來。但是他一離危境，又熾起愛國狂熱來了，手上面上已不覺痛，吃過飯，大家都去睡息，他却連忙出去打聽，知道昨夜中國軍隊竟獲得大勝。不覺狂喜！他想：活了幾十年，還不曾遇見過中國軍隊和外國軍隊打仗呢！這又像是做夢，中國軍隊居然打了勝仗！他又不自禁地要回到閘北去，署一看勝利之蹟；他全忘了昨夜的恐怖。</p>
<p>母親自然不同意他回閘北去。他說：</p>
<p>［我們逃出來時，都没有帶得錢，那有錢用呢？好在是我國勝利，閘北仍然是我們的閘北·甫以去提，　我到家裏看看，有没有被炸，順便取錢來。［</p>
<p>母親想想也不錯；但是今天晏了，明天早晨去罷。於是他安歇了一夜，明晨就眞個回閘北去了。却不料這一去，母親等了兩天，還不見他回來，憂愁得什麽似的！到第三天，纔有一個人送了一封信來，便呌雄兒念給伊聽：</p>
<p>［我家已被萬惡的敵人炸成粉碎了，國仇家仇，如何不報？如何不報？兒已决心加入軍隊，與敵人搏戰，母親當我在一二八之夜眞已遭了不測罷！好在母親很安全，雄兒也快要長大成人了可代兒侍奉；兒如不死，也仍舊回來侍奉的，請母親勿悲勿念！軍中無多暇，不能詳禀。兒鄭華叩。］（完）</p>

<h3 id="c143">托羅斯基裙帶關係 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>一九二四年，托羅斯基在他的［十月革命之敎訓］的一文中，大胆而盡量的攻擊其妹夫，中央執行委員基诺威愛夫，當然這是所謂［政治鬥爭］，至於他們的誰是誰非，我們局外人當然不必過問，然而托氏爲其［政治］而破除情面，全不爲其［令妹］設想，眞是値得我們大爲驚奇，爲什麽他爲了［國家的政治關係］却比［自已的［裙帶關係］還重要得多的呢？</p>
<p>外國有尚理智不尚感情，我國人重感情不重理智，原是一個大大的分别，［朝裏無人莫做官］，已經成了處世的格言，那末，有誰［官運亨通］的做了大官，於是他的内兄内弟，他的聯襟，以及他的什麽，什麽，都不愁没飯吃，没官做，所謂［一人做官萬人亨福［，不消說，一切與這高官有［裙帶關係］的，都是鷄犬登仙，彈冠相慶，於是大［裙帶關係［之外，又有小［裙帶關係］，小［裙帶關係］之外，又有小小［裙帶關係］，其間直接間接，牽連而及，至於不可究詰，這種官可名之曰［裙帶之官］，相率成風，互相則凃·遍及全國，名之曰［裙帶之國］，</p>
<p>這一點，就裙帶關係的機缘而言，此外更有裙帶關係的特殊權利，亦不妨略舉一二，作奸犯科，贪贓枉法，國家法律所不能及，一也，勢位旣隆，黨徒自衆，百足之虫，至死不殭，二也，洋房巨厦，甲第雲連，美妾嬌妻，競相誇耀，三也，理智有時的確可以戰勝情感，但在這一點上，情感亦確能克服理智，</p>
<p>故托羅斯基因政爭關係，而盡量攻擊其妹夫，未免太不近人情，基诺威愛夫因政爭關係，而被托羅斯基所攻擊未免太覺不智，</p>
<p>唉！羅蘇人眞是贛兄，</p>

<h3 id="c146">電網 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 宣</p>
<p>談到電綱普通一班人都以爲是很可怕的東西，其實電網並不如一班人想像這樣可怕，牠的效率是委微少的。要知道電網的效用，百分之九十在網，百分之十在電；因爲破網較難，破電倒是很容易的事情。</p>
<p>電網通電後，目的在人觸電時，即刻可致死命，故所用的電壓很高，普通大概在三千伏脫（ＶoＬt）以上。因直流電不能發生這樣高的電壓，故電網所用的電是交流電，就是電流的方向在一定極短之時間内相互交换的電。（現在電燈所用的電，大半是這種電。）電網在無人接觸時，電路是不通的。因爲電網所用之發電機，一頭接網，一頭挿入地下，但網與地並未連接，故電路不能。假定有人獨網，那麽網與地面的電路已通，電流便由發電機流到網上，經過人體而入地，再由地回至發電機。人體因受高壓電流通過，於是喪失生命。</p>
<p>電網所用的交流發電機，電壓是很高的，可是電流並不大。所以這種發電機内的綫圈，不能受强大的電流通過否則綫圈就要燒燬。破電網的電源條就是利用這一點。法了很簡單：用一，金屬鏈，一端連一粗大金屬棒，將棒挿入地面，其他一端，抛入電網上。那麽電網與地的電路通了，電流便由網經金屬鏈和棒而入地下。因爲金屬鏈和棒比網上的電綫粗大多了，牠們的電阻力亦比網上的電綫底電阻力少得多。换句話說，同樣的傳電體，越粗大，電流便越容易通過。因此，當電通過鏈和棒時，有巨大電流發生。這樣强大的電流，由地流回發電機，便要將發電機的綫圈燒燬。所以這樣一來，不特電網上的電源被截斷了，而且發電的機器亦被燬了。不過普通發電機上都裝有保險絲，預防强大電流通過。這種保險絲能通過最大的電流量，都有一定。如超過這一定之量，這絲因發熱過多，便要熔解，於是强大電流，便不能通過。所以當我們用上面方法破電網的電源時，發電機是不會給我們弄壞的，不過牠的保險絲已被巨大電流熔斷了，因此發電機和電網所連接的電路斷了，電流便不能由發電機流到電網上。這時電網便和普通的鐵絲綱無異。</p>
<p>這次滬戰發生，大家都說日本用電網了，其實據可靠消息，日本這次並未曾用電網。上而已經說過，電網的效用百分之九十在網，所以電的效用是少極了！這就因爲破電太容易的缘故。普通一班人，看到鐵絲網，便說電網。日本人看到我國一班人無知，亦大放其電網空氣，以寒我軍心；其實他們所用的都是些鐵絲網罷了。這都因爲我國人民智識太幼稚，因此往往受人所愚！</p>

<h3 id="c147">電影救國 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>前天本刋曾經刋過一篇跳舞救國，跳舞而可以救國，我想表演模特兒者將統一世界了，事實上當然不可能的，不過一篇滑稽而含有諷刺的論文吧了，</p>
<p>近來中國的靑年，除了醉心於跳押熱以外，電影熱的度數，恐怕比跳舞還高，但我以爲跳舞救國，不過說說吧了，而電影却眞的可以救國呢，</p>
<p>電影在普遍的人們看來，似乎衹不過爲一種娱樂的工具，其實電影的本身，自有它那偉大的價値，它是藝術的結晶，而同時安還是一種陶治民衆思想的一種良好工具，電影，的確是一種良好的宣傳工具，比如這一次中日兩軍，在滬作戰，我們儘可把日軍的暴行，閘北的慘狀，攝入了鏡頭，放映於銀幕的上面，使中國的民衆，目覩了這種影片，能夠很深刻地印在腦海之中，永遠不忘我們的仇敵，而思有以復仇，</p>
<p>再如十九路軍的戰跡，我們攝入了影戲機的裏面，不但可以開映於民衆之前，就是軍隊掋裏面，我們</p>
<p>也不妨去放映，使一般的中國軍人，能打破以前所抱不抵抗的觀念，而在國難時期，能夠奮勇殺敵，不過事實上說來，中國各影片公司，以前所攝的影片，大都以迎合社會心理爲主要目標，什麽神怪，武俠，愛情等片，十九足以使觀衆思想的沉醉而腐化，這種影片，非但不足救國，甚且足以亡國，結果是非常危險，</p>
<p>所以今後的中國電影界，當迅速的覺悟到電影的責任，改變從胆所抱的觀念，積極提倡含有民族性的影片，使得一般的觀衆，能夠明瞭中華民族的危途，人人能爲民族而奮鬥，並力爭中華民族的永久生存，這樣才能盡那電影界的責成，而完成電影救國的使命</p>

<h3 id="e1">Deliberations on the Postal Rate Increase <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>According to a special dispatch from this newspaper on the 21st, the Ministry of Communications, undeterred by opposition, has decided to implement the postal rate increase on May 1st. As this matter significantly affects the future of culture and the burden on the people, I venture to offer my humble opinion to the authorities. The purpose of a national postal service lies not in financial revenue, but in facilitating cultural exchange and transmitting information, serving the entire population, just as Vice Minister Chen Fumu of the Ministry of Communications stated, "acting on behalf of others." Historically, the postal service has been able to maintain financial independence without relying on state treasury subsidies due to its strict system, diligent staff, and overall unity. Otherwise, with continuous civil wars and obstructed transportation, the postal service would have been on the verge of collapse. Now, suddenly hearing about a postal rate increase, could it truly be that the postal service itself is facing unsustainable circumstances?</p>
<p>The decision on whether to increase postal rates should depend on the motivation behind the increase. According to the authorities, the current increase is due to a shortfall in revenue and an increase in expenditure. The revenue shortfall is a result of natural disasters and foreign aggression, while the expenditure increase is influenced by a sharp rise in transportation costs and wages. However, according to those familiar with the situation, the fundamental reason for the gradual decline of the postal service today lies in the diminishing of its independent spirit. In the past, postal authorities adhered to the principle of "postal economics exclusively supporting the postal service," thus maintaining independence and gradually developing even under adverse political circumstances. In recent years, the government has altered its approach to the postal service, adding unnecessary ventures, establishing redundant agencies that waste financial resources, and dividing responsibilities, such as airmail and savings &amp; remittance services.</p>
<p>Whether airmail is urgently needed is a major question. As Vice Minister Chen Fumu stated, our postal delivery equipment is quite crude, still using civilian boats instead of steamships and pedestrian delivery instead of vehicles. There are still many postal routes waiting to be developed in remote areas. Why doesn't the authority seek gradual and steady development from such practical facilities, instead of urgently expanding this unnecessary airmail service? Even considering the already established airmail routes, the expenditure is huge while the benefits are minimal from the perspective of the postal service itself. All airmail revenue is given to the airline companies, which is still insufficient. The authorities then use large sums of money to compensate for the airline companies' losses. Using the postal service's limited revenue to subsidize businesses outside the postal service's scope, this kind of "robbing Peter to pay Paul" plan will inevitably harm the postal service's economy, causing it to feel its own difficulties. This is a major reason for the increase in postal expenditure.</p>
<p>As for savings &amp; remittance services, establishing a separate bureau destroys the postal system on one hand and sharply increases expenses on the other. The authorities have difficulty revealing the true business situation of the savings &amp; remittance bureau. The report for the 19th year claims huge profits, but according to investigations by those familiar with the inner workings, this is a fictitious and inflated figure. Rumors abound that it suffered significant losses due to speculation in government bonds, so the postal service, which used to rely on the profits of savings &amp; remittance services, is now reduced to eating painted cakes to satisfy hunger. This is another reason for the increase in postal expenditure.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decline of the postal service today is generally due to the authorities' altered approach. Although postal workers occasionally voice their opinions, hoping for improvement from the authorities, the authorities, under these circumstances, inevitably have to increase the burden on the people to compensate for the impact of their inappropriate measures. The numerous criticisms from the people today are indeed unavoidable.</p>
<h3 id="e2">League of Nations Has No Solution to the Situation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Schumann hopes for a public meeting at the end of this week, but there are currently no signs of breaking the deadlock. The next meeting of the Special Committee is also uncertain. Japan claims it will not attend the Special Committee meeting. National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd: Schumann, chairman of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations Assembly, stated today that he hopes to hold a public meeting on Saturday, but the timing of the meeting will depend on Japan's response. Although there have been reports that Japan may not agree with the Committee's attitude, League of Nations leaders believe that bad news should not be anticipated and still hope that the situation can be adjusted amicably.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 21st: According to today's news, the deadlock between Japan and the League of Nations remains. Japanese representative Nagaoka has received instructions from Tokyo confirming Japan's opposition to the draft resolution of the League of Nations Special Committee. The Japanese now want to change to a different plan that would not greatly damage Japan's reputation and would also allow the Japanese government to avoid constitutional difficulties. The League of Nations has now authorized the Shanghai Mixed Commission to decide the date of the Japanese troops' withdrawal, regardless of Japan's consent. This is a major obstacle. The Japanese government, based on established custom, cannot arbitrarily issue orders on major military matters such as troop withdrawal or make promises lightly, as such privileges belong to the Emperor. If the Mixed Commission decides when the Japanese troops must withdraw and the opinion differs from that of the Emperor's representative, the Emperor will be placed in an inconceivably humiliating position. However, the clause regarding the withdrawal of troops is the most critical part of the entire plan and was finalized by the Special Committee after repeated deliberation. Therefore, there are currently no good signs of breaking this deadlock.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd: Representatives of various countries are showing anxiety over the slow progress in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. Stimson's conversation with Schumann lasted for an hour. Stimson inquired in detail about the emotions expressed by the Committee of Nineteen. The two politicians discussed various key points of the current situation. It is now believed that Stimson has indicated how the United States can do its best to support the steps taken by the League of Nations, given its position. The Japanese delegation has stated that it cannot accept Article 11 of the resolution as it stands today. A senior Japanese official told a Reuters reporter that Japan is now trying to propose a more agreeable plan. Japan hopes to find a way to escape today's unfortunate situation. The Chinese delegation firmly refuses to delete or amend the disputed clauses. They did not participate in any informal negotiations, but quietly await the action of the Committee of Nineteen.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd: US Secretary of State Stimson and Schumann, chairman of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations Assembly, met today to discuss the deadlock in the Sino-Japanese dispute. The development of the Sino-Japanese dispute remains at a standstill. Schumann is still awaiting Japan's official reply today. Unofficial affairs are very difficult to handle and extremely complicated. The next meeting of the Committee of Nineteen will not be held before April 26.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Japan is determined to withdraw from the League of Nations rather than agree to the application of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to the Manchurian incident. This is already an open secret. According to reliable sources today, Japan is now also insisting on no concessions regarding the issue of the Committee of Nineteen handling the Shanghai truce negotiations. Japan has never recognized the Committee's qualifications to handle this matter and believes that the Committee's intervention will only make it impossible to resolve this issue for the time being.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: British representative Simon and other major powers are very concerned about the direct conflict between Japan and the Committee of Nineteen. If Japan clashes with small countries at the League of Nations General Assembly in nearly May, Japan will be at a disadvantage in the war. Therefore, they advised Representative Nagaoka that it would be better to attend the public meeting of the Committee of Nineteen and present his views. Representative Nagaoka telegraphed to Foreign Minister Yoshizawa for instructions, who issued the following joint instructions and immediately telegraphed his reply today, stating that the Committee of Nineteen was established based on Japan's abstention resolution at the General Assembly, so Japan does not recognize the Committee. Moreover, the actions of small countries are biased against Japan, so there is no need to attend. Proceed according to the established policy and make it clear that Japan will not attend the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Guo Taiqi and Lampson Went to Beijing Together Last Night <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The American Minister Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Truce Conference is Still Undated</p>
<p>Guo May Not Accept the Position of Ambassador to the UK</p>
<p>Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, and the rumor of the resumption of the truce conference was rampant for a while. Finally, due to our established policy that the special committee of the League of Nations Assembly must hold a public meeting to pass a resolution on the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops before a date can be set here for the meeting. Although the resolution passed by the secret meeting of the special committee of the League of Nations did not determine the date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, it stipulated that the Japanese troops must withdraw to the original defense before January 28 in the near future. The term "restoring normal state" was not mentioned in the resolution, only that the withdrawal time would be determined by the joint committee in Shanghai.</p>
<p>If either party in the Chinese Committee believes that the time has come, a meeting can be convened to decide. It is generally as reported. Our side has accepted it. Now the key lies with Japan. If the Japanese side agrees, a public meeting is expected to be held in Geneva today to formally pass it. The truce conference here is also expected to be reopened within the next week. However, just as the truce conference is about to open but has not yet opened,</p>
<p>Nanjing suddenly decided to transfer Guo Taiqi to the position of ambassador to the UK and to appoint Xu Mo as the political vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The chief representative of our side at the truce conference has once again become a problem. Various rumors have arisen. As for Guo's transfer to the position of ambassador to the UK, some say that Guo had agreed to it beforehand. Guo believes that he has not yet received a formal order from the government and is unwilling to express his opinion on whether to accept the position. However, according to those familiar with the inside story, this matter still has some political background. Guo's ambassadorship to the UK may not be accepted. As for the chief representative of our side at the truce conference, Vice Minister Guo will continue to serve, so as to be familiar with the work. British Minister Lampson took the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Kung Wo steamer to Beijing last night as scheduled, but Vice Minister Guo also temporarily decided to take the same boat to Beijing last night, so very few people knew about it. Guo returned to Shanghai for only a few days and is now going to Beijing again. His mission is half for the truce conference issue and half for the issue of being sent as ambassador to the UK. American Minister and Mrs. Johnson returned to Shanghai from Beijing at 2 p.m. yesterday. At 7 p.m. last night, British Minister Lampson and American Minister Johnson invited Guo Taiqi to a tea party to exchange views on the continuation of the truce conference until it broke up at 8 p.m.</p>

The enemy's rear team dared not advance and only opened fire until 6 p.m. On the morning of the 22nd, a sentry battle broke out at Liujia Jiao near Ludu Bridge. Soon, 150-160 enemies from Ludu Bridge arrived to reinforce, and the sound of gunfire was very dense for a while, resulting in a fierce battle for three hours. In the afternoon, dozens of enemies from Liuhe drove to Liujia Jiao by bicycle and set up machine guns. On the morning of the 22nd, dozens of enemies sneaked across the river from Loutang via Yuanjia Du to Zhongdu and were swept by our guns, killing seven enemies and wounding more than ten. We suffered no losses. Three Japanese ships arrived at Qiyakou on the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Situation in Western Shanghai is Tense <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the situation of the Japanese army in western Shanghai has suddenly become tense again. It is rumored that defensive works are being rushed in Zhoujia Bridge and other places. After detailed investigation by reporters from various sources, an agency in Beixinjing claimed that there were no defensive works built by the Japanese army in the two places or any intruding action. However, the Japanese-owned Toyota textile factory in Fangaodu suddenly dispatched a large number of marines to be heavily guarded. The latest situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Stationing of Sailors: After the truce, the large number of marines originally stationed in the factory were withdrawn, and only a few plainclothes teams were stationed in the factory. Later, Japanese businessmen in the factory were eager to resume work, so they began to drive workers to the factory at the beginning of this month. At first, there were only five or six hundred workers, but now it has increased to more than one thousand. Unexpectedly, a large team of marines, about a hundred, were transported to the factory by several trucks the afternoon before yesterday and stationed there. They also carried four machine guns and placed them in the factory.</p>
<p>Armored Cars Patrolling: Two No. 4 and No. 10 armored cars are stationed in the factory. They are driven out of the factory from time to time and go south along Zhongshan Road, through Hongqiao Road, to the Tongwen College in Xujiahui. They stop briefly at the entrance of the college and then turn around and patrol the roads, returning. They stop to demonstrate whenever they see crowds gathering along the way.</p>
<p>Climbing Up to Observe: The Japanese marines stationed in the factory now climb onto the roof during the day, holding binoculars to observe in all directions for reconnaissance because the situation has turned tense again. Japanese businessmen in the factory have also disappeared and do not come out.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Compilation of Military News from the Front <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Kunshan, 22nd Special Dispatch: When the enemy's 9th and 14th Divisions transported reinforcements, they were all accompanied by military police. Shirakawa ordered the 5th Regiment to depart from Huangdu, consisting of two battalions each of infantry and cavalry, one company each of machine gunners and White Russian soldiers, a team of 50-60 plainclothes soldiers, and twelve field guns. The enemy has been measuring waterways in the Zhangjiajing and Jiwangmiao area for days, seemingly attempting to cross the river secretly.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 22nd Special Dispatch: Enemy Commander Shirakawa inspected the Xinmu Bridge position outside the east gate of Taicang on the 22nd. Since the enemy occupied Liuhe, Chen Wenbiao was appointed as the maintenance officer. Chen was removed and replaced by Wu Shantai. Now Wu has been replaced by the manager of Wanmao Sauce Garden as the maintenance officer.</p>

<p>Another Japanese Warship Fleet Arrives: The Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai has recently reduced to more than twenty ships at Wusong and Pukou, anchored in various sections. Recently, naval transportation has been extremely active. Yesterday, a fleet of thirteen torpedo boats, a total of four ships, came from Japan. Three of them went directly to Shanghai and anchored at Yangshupu, while the other ship went to Yanglinkou and anchored. The ships were loaded with military supplies to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Military Food Loaded: The food, clothing, and vehicles needed by the Japanese troops in Shanghai are all transported from Japan.

<h3 id="e8">The National Salvation Association of the Education Community Expresses: <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Community National Salvation Joint Association respectfully informs all educators nationwide: Fellow educators across the country, may you all take note. What is the state of the nation entrusted to our people today? In the long term, it has been half a year; in the short term, it has been two months. What kind of scenes have our educators seen and heard, leaving deep impressions that can never be forgotten? Every day in school, colleagues see a group of lively and lovely young people. Thinking of their future, will they be masters of their own country or slaves of a conquered nation? What kind of feelings should they have? Hearing the news from Liaoning Province that foreign-compiled textbooks will be used in schools and that each school will have a foreigner as an instructor, what kind of reaction should they have in their hearts? Hearing the news from overseas that the principals of American schools have united with all sectors to boycott the import of certain countries' goods and that students of Japanese primary and secondary schools are cooperating wholeheartedly to donate money to purchase patriotic aircraft, what kind of thoughts should they have? Please, fellow educators across the country, reflect further. The danger to the nation entrusted to us has reached such a point. Can it be saved by us continuing to teach classes as usual, rigidly lecturing, ignoring everything after class, and being indifferent to everything after leaving school? How can we continue the old life of our nation? How can we open up the new life of our nation? How can we cultivate and develop the source of our national life? It all depends on the minds, mouths, hands, and feet of us educators. How urgent is the mission? How great is the responsibility? If we still adhere to the old-fashioned teaching of textbooks, guiding students, and not using our spare time and energy to engage in national salvation work after class, and if we still rest and enjoy ourselves as usual on Sundays, how can we be worthy of our sacred profession? How can we be worthy of the soldiers who sacrifice themselves to defend the country? How can we be worthy of the countless people who have been brutally killed, raped, and displaced? How can we be worthy of the friendly countries that uphold justice, humanity, and express sympathy to us? We educators should resolutely shoulder the great task of national salvation, not blame others but first blame ourselves, not expect others to do it but first do it ourselves. We will always do it to the end regardless of whether others do it or not. We will always seek the peace of our own conscience first, regardless of whether it succeeds or not. Alas, alas, life is but a few decades. Rather than being a cowardly and complacent person, living in fear, hesitation, worry, shame, it is better to roll up our sleeves and stand up and establish a personality for ourselves. It is said that there is a young female singer in the north named Li Xiangrong. Every time she takes the stage, before she officially starts singing, she must first give a simple speech, advising the audience on how to love the country and how to save the country. Alas, this is also social education. If a young female singer can do this, what more should we educators do? National crisis is imminent, and the invaders are deep. Our association feels that the scope is too narrow, and our colleagues feel that their ability is lacking. We deeply hope that all gentlemen of the education community across the country will unite and actively carry out our work. The members of this association are not talented, but they are willing to do our utmost and charge forward. We would be grateful if you would write to us and provide detailed methods. The address is No. 80, Hualong Road, Huanlong Road Intersection, French Concession, Shanghai, and we will report on it. We respectfully send this message to you and wish you peace.</p>

<p>Madame Xiao's Sentiments: The Continental Daily News reported that when Madame Xiao De arrived in China aboard the President Taft, over a thousand Japanese people gathered at the pier in Yokohama, shouting her name and arbitrarily insulting her. Due to the chaotic and fierce situation, the crew advised Madame Xiao not to disembark to avoid any unexpected incidents, so she remained on board all day. When the ship arrived in Kobe, approximately three thousand people gathered at the pier, shouting and clamoring. The crew again advised Madame Xiao to remain on board. The captain, fearing that the Japanese would board the ship and act barbarously, placed special guards at the gangway for secret protection. Madame Taft stayed in Kobe for two days, and Madame Xiao barely left her room. Yesterday, when Madame Xiao spoke with a representative of the Continental Daily News, she deeply regretted that only one or two of her compatriots welcomed her upon her arrival in Shanghai, but she was extremely gratified by the Chinese people's grand welcome.</p>
<p>Telegram from Overseas Chinese: Respectfully informing that Madame Xiao, mother of aviator Xiao, accompanied by her second son, is scheduled to depart from this port on the President Taft on April 2nd to bid a final farewell to the late Xiao in Shanghai. Their round-trip tickets and gratuities have been duly provided by this association. We hereby respectfully present this letter to Your Excellency, requesting that you kindly take care of everything upon their arrival in Shanghai to alleviate their grief and comfort the late martyr. Please borrow all travel expenses in the motherland from your office to show preferential treatment, and enclose forty dollars in silver to be used to purchase flowers for the funeral of the late martyr Xiao in the name of this association. This is most earnestly requested. Sincerely, Chen Zemin, Chairman of the Chinese Overseas National Salvation Relief Association in Cerro, United States, addressed to Minister Song.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong's Telegram: To Director Du Tingxiu in Shanghai, for translation and transmission to Madame Xiao, mother of American aviator Xiao De: Your son fought for justice and humanity, cooperating with our country's national army to resist the brutal Japanese, disregarding hardship and sacrificing himself. Although he unfortunately died with his aspirations unfulfilled, he has gained the admiration and mourning of our country's government and military, as well as the praise and sympathy of the world. His honor and spirit will last forever. I hereby send this telegram to express my condolences and hope that you will take care of yourself. Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Fifth Army of the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, seal.</p>
<p>Letter of Condolences from the People: The Shanghai Joint Association of People's Organizations yesterday sent a letter to Madame Xiao De, translated as follows: Respectfully informing that the brutal Japanese are tyrannical and are destroying world peace, which all people of the world condemn. During the recent Shanghai incident, Righteous Martyr Xiao De saw injustice and acted bravely, unfortunately sacrificing his life. Our citizens, in their grief, deeply admire the righteous martyr's talent and heroic spirit. Now that he is gone from your presence, we can only imagine your sadness. However, having a son like this is something to be proud of. We hope that you will restrain your grief and take care of your health. We send this special letter to express our condolences and wish you well on your journey.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Cruel and Shameful in Shanghai War</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: The Manchester Guardian today published an editorial ridiculing Colonel Shoji's article in the Japan Weekly Chronicle, in which he claimed that the Japanese army's valiant achievements in Shanghai were divinely aided. The newspaper asked: "Is it not easy to destroy densely populated towns and villages by bombing from the air? Such an act is particularly cruel and particularly shameful. If Colonel Shoji refers to this as divine assistance, how can Colonel Shoji's actions prove the justice of his beliefs?"</p>

(b) Managing the fund. (c) Selecting the locations of air force districts and planning the construction of each district. (d) Supervising the personnel administration of the air force and aviation agencies, and formulating regulations for the organization of aviation agencies.

<p>Statement by Mr. Xue Keling</p>
<p>Does Not Imply Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Recently, it has been widely rumored that the American Radio Corporation has signed a new contract with the puppet Manchurian government regarding the Northeast Radio Station. Yesterday, Xue Keling, the company's representative in China, stated that the company has not signed any new contracts with any parties regarding the Northeast Radio Station. The current restoration of communication between San Francisco and Shenyang is solely for the convenience of the public and cannot be regarded as de facto recognition of the Manchurian government. Furthermore, according to news received in this city, the German radio station has resumed communication between Nauen and Shenyang, and the French radio station will also resume telegraphic services between Paris and Shenyang.</p>

<p>International Credit Now Shaken</p>
<p>Although Manchuria is Obtained, Development is Lacking in Capital</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Professor Tao Fuman of the University of California has come to China specifically to investigate the Manchurian problem from a financial perspective. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and stated to a representative of the Continental Daily News that Japan attaches great importance to the administrative rights of Manchuria. Manchuria is vast and rich in natural resources, but huge amounts of capital are required for its development. Japan is currently a purely debtor nation and is facing many major financial difficulties. It is not easy for Japan to overcome these difficulties. Its budget has long been unbalanced, and since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, its expenditures have exceeded its revenues, and it has had to remit huge sums of money overseas. The commercial trade deficit has continued to increase. Japan's international credit is now shaken, and it is very difficult to borrow money from foreign countries. The longer this situation persists, the more difficult Japan's finances will become. If Japan wants to maintain its international credit, it cannot allow its commercial trade deficit to continue indefinitely. Professor Tao will travel from Shanghai to Japan on Saturday to continue his investigation and plans to return to the United States upon completion.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Wang Bin Assassinated Yesterday <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>In Front of the Foreign Cemetery on Avenue Villemont</p>
<p>Two Bullets to the Head, Died En Route</p>
<p>Wang Bin, the current inspector of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was shot and killed by an enemy in an assassination attempt yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM while traveling in his private car near the foreign cemetery on Avenue Villemont in the French Concession. The driver was also seriously injured, and a stray bullet injured a child. The detailed events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Wang Bin: Wang Bin, courtesy name Songsheng, also known as Songsun, was a native of Suzhou, 39 years old. He had served in the military and police for many years. He was naturally diligent and efficient. When General Qian Dajun served concurrently as the commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Wang was introduced by a friend and served as an investigator in the headquarters' investigation department. He solved many important cases, especially in anti-communist work and the investigation of reactionary elements, and was highly praised by successive commanders. In August of last year, he was promoted to inspector.</p>
<p>Family Circumstances: Wang's first wife died early, leaving behind a son named Baobao, 15 years old. He currently has one wife and one concubine, both from brothel backgrounds. His current wife, Gu, is 33 years old, a native of Suzhou, residing at No. 3 Yong'an Lane, Bair Road, Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession. His concubine, Weng, is 25 years old, a native of Changshu, residing separately at No. 509 Dashun Lane, Xizang Road in the Public Concession. Gu has an eight-year-old daughter who is not Wang's child. Wang also has a widowed mother in her sixties.</p>
<p>Sudden Tragedy: Wang stayed overnight at Dashun Lane the night before. At 11:10 AM yesterday morning, Wang took his private car to Bair Road for lunch. At 1:50 PM, he planned to go to the Wenquan bathhouse at the Xixinqiao intersection on Avenue Edward VII to meet a friend. The driver, Yin Zaiqing (also known as A Si, 28 years old, native of Haimen), pulled the car out and headed north, turning east onto Wusongjiang Road and then north onto Avenue Villemont. When they reached the gate of the foreign cemetery and were turning onto Avenue Haig, the tragedy struck. The car had just entered Avenue Haig when four thugs—two in Western suits, one in a gray gown, and one in blue cloth—suddenly rushed out of the side of the road and pursued Wang's car. One of them pulled out a pistol and shot Wang in the head twice. One bullet entered the back of his head and exited his right cheek, and the other entered his occipital bone and exited his right forehead. Driver A Si screamed for help, and the thug shot A Si in the waist. A Si fell to the ground, and the car immediately overturned, throwing Wang onto the sidewalk. The thugs, seeing that their objective had been achieved, fled in all directions.</p>
<p>Investigation and Protection: When the thugs opened fire, Ms. Qiu Huang, a Guangdong widow residing on the third floor of No. 162 Avenue Haig, a Shuangji Salted Meat shop, was returning home from outside with her mother, Ms. Huang, and her sister, Qiu Feifei (a dancer at the Da Hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road), and a nine-year-old boy named Jin Jiu. A stray bullet flew by, grazing the top of Jin Jiu's head, causing a minor cut and bleeding. The Songshan Road police station, hearing the news, dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate. They rushed Wang and the other two to the police station and then to the Guangci Hospital on Rue du Pere Robert.</p>
<p>Died En Route: Wang died en route due to his fatal injuries. His body was immediately taken to the Tongren Auxiliary Hall for an autopsy. Driver Yin A Si was shot in the right lower back, penetrating the right abdomen. He was still conscious upon arrival at the hospital, but his pulse was extremely weak due to excessive blood loss. According to Dr. Pruce, the French forensic pathologist, the driver's injury was fatal and his life was likely in danger. He immediately underwent surgery and is currently lying in ordinary room 41 of the hospital. The child, Qiu Jin Jiu, was bandaged and discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>Tragedy Due to Public Duty: Wang had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, and the news of his death caused great sorrow among his relatives and friends. There is much speculation about the reasons for his death, but the main reason is likely due to his public duty. The police station and headquarters attach great importance to the case and have ordered a thorough investigation to arrest the perpetrators. Wang's friends originally planned to hold a funeral for him at the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road on the 24th of the month, but because the American righteous martyr Xiao De's funeral is scheduled for the 24th, the funeral was changed to 2:00 PM on the 25th, with the burial at the Xieqiao Jiyi Cemetery.</p>
<p>Message from the Funeral Committee: Yesterday, the temporary funeral committee established by his friends issued the following public announcement: "Mr. Wang Bin, courtesy name Songsheng, first-class inspector of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was usually eager for public service and dared to take responsibility. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he was unexpectedly ambushed by enemies near the Gu'en Temple on Avenue Villemont in the French Concession and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, but unfortunately died. Mr. Wang was a native of Suzhou, only 39 years old this year, leaving behind a frail old mother and young children, and he had no savings. His situation is very desolate. Now his friends are handling the funeral arrangements, which will be held at 2:00 PM on the 25th at the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, and the burial will be at the Xieqiao Jiyi Cemetery. Mr. Wang had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, and all who heard the news were deeply saddened."</p>

<p>Hidden Military Supplies Discovered Near Harbin</p>
<p>(Moscow) A telegram from Peiping states that the activities of White Russians in the area of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Harbin continue unabated. Although the Chinese police authorities of that port have expressed their responsibility to protect railway traffic and the safety of the railway bureau's work, on the 19th of this month, a large number of White Russians who were dismissed from the railway bureau broke into the office and carried out sabotage. After the police arrived, they did not interfere. The Soviet consul, Slavutsky, then stated to the local military authorities that this situation proved that there was obviously a considerable connection between the White Russians who were creating disturbances and the Chinese police. It is also reported that the Harbin police station has received an order to refuse to issue passports to Soviet citizens who apply to return to their country, so that Soviet citizens cannot leave Manchuria even if they want to. Recently, there have been daily reports of Soviet citizens being detained and inspected. The Soviet consul has repeatedly protested, demanding the release of those arrested, but without any result.

<p>Warns the League of Nations Not to Interfere in Affairs of the Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>Resolutely Rejects Application of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd – Army Minister Araki made wild claims regarding the affairs of the three northeastern provinces in a speech at a gathering of a certain organization in Osaka today, warning the League of Nations and Soviet Russia not to interfere in the affairs of the three northeastern provinces, claiming that Japan is determined to resolutely reject the attempt to apply the Nine-Power Treaty to the three northeastern provinces. He continued to talk about the threatening situation in northern Manchuria, saying that this was caused by Soviet Russia's heavy troop concentration on the border and increased forces in the Far East. He also said that Japan's mission is to make the three northeastern provinces a [paradise on earth], a place of safety for everyone, and no matter what actions the League of Nations, Soviet Russia, or other countries take, they cannot make Japan change its course. The time is ripe, and the Japanese are determined to cooperate with the new government of the three northeastern provinces to establish a great culture in the Far East.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Osaka, 22nd – The Kokuhonsha held a current affairs lecture meeting here yesterday and invited Army Minister Araki to speak. Araki said in brief that the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents have come to an end, and in the future, the land of Manchuria must not be allowed to fall into chaos again. We must build a peaceful environment, and if there are obstacles, no matter what kind of people they are, we must resolutely suppress them. If Russia attempts to disturb Manchuria or the League of Nations discusses the Manchurian issue, we have no need to worry. Some people advocate applying the Nine-Power Treaty, then we can refuse to discuss it, and if it is unsuccessful, we will resolve it by force. Looking at the northern Manchurian border, Russia is reinforcing the four divisions of its land and air forces in the Far East and concentrating its forces on the Sino-Russian border. What is the Soviet Union's intention? It is unclear and its future is extremely worthy of attention. From this point of view, the current situation in our country is indeed eventful. In any case, uniting with the new state of Manchuria to maintain Manchurian peace and build Oriental culture is the important determination that the people should have. It is hoped that officials and civilians of our country will all follow the imperial decree, base themselves on the spirit of the foundation of the nation, unite as one, and cooperate to properly handle the current eventful situation of the country.</p>

<p>Searching for Concrete Ways to Address Major World Problems</p>
<p>The Four Giants Performing the Climax Scene</p>
<p>The US Secretary of State Remains Hidden Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 22nd – According to various indications obtained this morning, the talks between major European and American politicians here today have entered the important stage of performing the climax scene. US Secretary of State Stimson remains temporarily behind the scenes, taking orders. The four giants, MacDonald, Brüning, Grandi, and Tardieu, are the central figures in front. French Prime Minister Tardieu had a long talk with German Chancellor Brüning yesterday and will continue to talk today. German Undersecretary of State Pünder will also participate. This morning, British Prime Minister MacDonald visited Brüning to discuss matters in secret for a long time. Then, Brüning invited Tardieu and MacDonald to have lunch together. This afternoon, when Tardieu and Brüning meet, MacDonald will meet with Italian Foreign Minister Grandi. It is expected that the four giants will meet each other in turn throughout the day. If some exploratory proposals can be obtained in these preparatory negotiations to obtain a more concrete way, then it may be possible to meet until late at night.</p>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 21st – Tonight, people in the League of Nations have expressed a fear that the talks between European and American politicians on major issues concerning Europe and the world will soon reach a deadlock. So far, there has been no visible progress on the issues of reparations and disarmament. The reason is said to be the strong attitude of France, making the future almost hopeless. The only issue where there may be some progress is the issue of rescuing the Danube states. It is said that the four major powers have earnestly agreed that their economic experts will meet here on the 23rd of this month to re-examine this matter. The British representative is Sir Rose, the German representative is Count Kroschke, the Italian representative is Professor Pignedo, and the French representative is Pishu.</p>
<p>Stimson Telegrams Report to the US</p>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 21st – Stimson telegraphed the US State Department today, reporting that the matters discussed with various European dignitaries today were limited to disarmament and the Far East. The German Chancellor intended to mention economic issues but did not have time to consider them. Furthermore, Stimson met with Tardieu once this morning. Stimson specifically and solemnly declared to Tardieu that Washington would not participate in the discussion of the European [security] plan and would not give prior consent to not trading with aggressor countries. Tardieu then turned his attention to Britain.</p>
<p>Reparations Conference Scheduled to Be Held</p>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 21st – It was recently learned from reliable sources that the results of the meeting between British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Tardieu, US Secretary of State Stimson, German Chancellor Brüning, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi have finally decided that the Lausanne Conference to discuss war debts, reparations, etc., will be convened on June 16.</p>

<p>England, America, Germany, and Italy Unite to Oppose the French Proposal</p>
<p>Thirteen Nations Propose a New Plan to Support France's Position</p>
<p>Simon Concedes to France</p>
<p>Amendments to the Proposed Text</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd: This morning, the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference unanimously passed a resolution attempting to reconcile the French theory of disarmament with the proposals of other nations. This resolution was proposed by British Foreign Secretary Simon and stated that the conference reserved the right to discuss the issue of qualitative disarmament later. For the time being, it would accept the principle that certain types of weapons should be abolished or placed under international control through international treaties. When discussing this resolution, French Premier Tardieu also declared his support, saying that it gave the Disarmament Conference the freedom to choose between complete abolition and international control. However, German representative Nadolny expressed dissatisfaction with the wording of the resolution, stating that although he would vote in favor, he wanted the minutes to record Germany's position that any qualitative disarmament should abolish certain offensive weapons and not place them under international control. He added that Germany and other disarmament countries were currently prohibited from manufacturing these weapons.</p>
<p>This is excellent proof that abolishing a layer is easier to implement, according to the National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd. Today, after the meeting of the General Committee of the International Disarmament Conference, discussions began on two opposing resolutions proposed successively by British Foreign Secretary Simon and Romanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Titulescu. British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Premier Tardieu both attended. Simon's resolution was supported by sixteen countries, while Titulescu's resolution was endorsed by thirteen countries: Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, Persia, Peru, Poland, Romania, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 21st: Today, during the General Committee of the International Disarmament Conference, Romanian representative and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Titulescu, on behalf of thirteen nations, proposed a resolution similar in effect to a counter-proposal against British Foreign Secretary Simon's resolution. Its content generally advocated that the General Committee of Disarmament unanimously declare its support for the principle of qualitatively reducing offensive weapons, and then leave the specific methods of reduction, whether through abolition or exclusive use by the League of Nations, for future discussion. Titulescu also requested that this resolution be merged with Simon's resolution. Later, when asked for his opinion, Soviet representative Litvinov stated that Titulescu's resolution was tantamount to the committee unanimously declaring that "we have failed to reach a consensus." He suggested that it would be more appropriate to call it a "non-resolution" rather than a "resolution." Litvinov expressed his support for Simon's resolution. The General Committee adjourned at 1:30 PM today and will reconvene on Friday.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 21st: Today, French newspapers commented that most representatives at the Disarmament Conference support the British proposal to qualitatively reduce armaments and abolish certain offensive weapons, indicating that the United States, Germany, Italy, and England have formed a united front to oppose France and its disarmament proposals. The "Le Matin" newspaper stated that Britain's proposal has closed the door to cooperation between Britain and France on disarmament and other issues. "L'Echo de Paris" stated that an anti-French front is rapidly consolidating, which is one reason why Premier Tardieu hastily went to Geneva yesterday.</p>

<p>Chinese Delegate Describes the Plight of Workers</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 21st: The International Labour Conference held a general meeting this morning to discuss the report of the Director-General of the International Labour Office, Thomas. All debates focused on the economic panic and unemployment issues. The Japanese delegate, Yoshisaka, stated that he was pleased that Thomas' report mentioned the issue of cooperation among overseas countries, as this was the most important issue that should be paid attention to. Yoshisaka explained the reasons why countries outside of Europe did not pay much attention to the Labour Conference, stating that the industrial situation in these countries was too different from that of European countries, and therefore the facilities of the International Labour Organization were still insufficient. He also mentioned political issues, such as the fact that the United States, an important industrial nation, has not yet joined the organization. Thirdly, he mentioned the economic difficulties caused by the global panic and said that the International Labour Organization does not seem to have done everything it should to solve this problem. The British labor representative said that reducing wages would reduce consumption and increase unemployment. The Chinese delegate, Hu Shih-tse, delivered a speech in fluent French, describing the current situation in China, saying that after experiencing natural disasters, it has suffered from the ravages of foreign troops, which is extremely tragic. He did not want to say much about the war, but it undoubtedly increased the suffering of workers in Shanghai and Manchuria, etc.</p>

<p>Telegram from Chongqing, reported to the Shanghai News: Recently, we heard that the Ministry of Communications is going to significantly increase postal rates again, which is extremely shocking. It has been found that the previous increase in postage for registered and regular letters by one cent has already burdened the common people. Now, suddenly, another two cents are being added to each, and the postage for printed books is being doubled or even tripled, making it even more difficult for the common people to obtain books. This is detrimental to education and cultural development. Moreover, the purpose of postal services is to facilitate communication, not to make profits. Therefore, postal rates in various countries around the world are light, such as in the United States, where the postage for regular letters has remained at only two cents since the founding of the country and has never been increased. However, in our country, it is increasing again and again, which is contrary to the original intention of establishing postal services. Post offices in our country have been profitable for many years and have not suffered losses, so there is no reason to increase prices. We urge you to withdraw the order and maintain a line of life for education and culture. We are extremely anxious and await your orders.

<p>Japanese Train Derails</p>
<p>Japanese Military Believes CER Must Be Held Responsible</p>
<p>Japanese Government Urgently Increases Troops to Defend Against Russia</p>
<p>Self-Defense Army Seizes the Opportunity to Recapture Fangzheng</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Regarding the derailment of a Japanese troop train on the Harbin-Suifenhe section of the CER near Cheng Gaozi Station on the night of the 12th of this month, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>The 23rd Company of the Infantry Battalion of the 39th Regiment, part of the Japanese Murakami Brigade, was returning to Harbin from Wugimi on a troop train at 5:00 PM on the 12th. The entire train consisted of 41 cars. In addition to the ten or so cars for soldiers, the remaining cars were used by about 200 Korean residents, both men and women, and were loaded with military supplies, automobiles, gasoline, and other items. Around 10:50 PM on the 12th, the train was traveling to a place called "Wan De Hao", about 953 kilometers from Harbin, between Xiangfang Station and Cheng Gaozi Station. The roadbed there was high and steep, and as the train was traveling downhill, someone had preemptively removed the bolts on the left side of the track. As soon as the train reached that spot, there was a loud crash from the locomotive, and immediately, 16 cars, including passenger and freight cars connected to the locomotive, derailed and rolled off a 20-foot embankment. The first five passenger cars were immediately crushed. Because one of them was carrying gasoline and another was carrying munitions, they exploded and caught fire after being crushed. Because of the strong wind, the flames were very fierce. Japanese Captain Asazuma, along with Lieutenant Kami, 12 soldiers, were crushed by the cars and burned to death. The rest crawled out of the broken iron and wood, but most were injured. The Russian guards on the train also sustained minor injuries. The train crew used the telephone on a roadside pole to contact Harbin and report the incident to the Japanese military. The Japanese dispatched an emergency train from Harbin to rescue. When the emergency train arrived, black smoke was still rising. Most of the bodies of the Japanese soldiers had been reduced to ashes. It took a long time to rescue the 27 seriously injured and transport them back to Harbin. The next day, an airplane went to scout for traces related to the incident, but found nothing. At noon, the CER dispatched an investigation car with senior road personnel to investigate. After transferring the undamaged cars onto the tracks and repairing the tracks, traffic was restored at 4:00 PM. While the Japanese soldiers were carrying out rescue work that day, a Chinese person passed by the area and was captured by the Japanese soldiers, tied to a telephone pole, and severely beaten, accused of being involved in the track removal. Later, he was taken to Harbin and detained. His fate is still unknown. Since this incident, the Japanese Ministry of the Army sent an urgent telegram to the commander of the Japanese division in Harbin, Domon, ordering him to investigate the true attitude of the Russian side of the CER towards Japan. At the same time, the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Shenyang also sent several specialists to Harbin on the 13th to conduct an investigation, recognizing that the matter was extremely important. On the afternoon of the 13th, Doihara, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Harbin, visited the Russian director of the CER to explain that the Japanese side had entrusted all transportation responsibilities, including the bearing of transportation costs, to the CER. Now that this tragic incident has occurred, the CER must take responsibility. The Russian director agreed that the Russian deputy directors and the head of the engineering department of the railway bureau would form an investigation committee to conduct an investigation. Doihara did not express his opinion, saying that it was not yet the time to negotiate and left. The Russian director then issued a statement in the afternoon, saying: "Regarding the discovery of an explosive device 945 kilometers away by Chadaofu on the 12th, the insurance area member Fan, and the employees Marazov, the district chief and his other colleagues, the road police officers, etc. went to investigate and remove it, resulting in the suspension of traffic between Harbin and Cheng Gaozi for three hours. Afterwards, it was determined that there was nothing unusual on the route between Harbin and Cheng Gaozi. According to the investigation by the rescue train, the derailment was caused by the first and four third-class passenger cars falling off the cliff and eleven freight cars derailing. The cause of the derailment was the removal of railroad bolts, etc."</p>
<p>The Japanese side believed that this type of statement was irresponsible. However, since this incident occurred, the Japanese have been actively engaged in military actions. The Second Division of the Kwantung Army will definitely not return home at the end of its term, and the 10th Division will be transferred from the country and landed in Dalian on the 15th. It is expected to arrive in Harbin around the 20th. Before the new troops arrive, the Japanese army had originally concentrated in Harbin to avoid traces of the League of Nations investigation team. At this moment, the plan to concentrate in Harbin for military importance was immediately canceled. The Murakami Brigade is scheduled to depart for Yimianpo on the 15th to set up defenses. The Amano Brigade is scheduled to be stationed in Heilongjiang on the 16th. The Suzuki Brigade, stationed in Heilongjiang, is scheduled to depart for the Harbin-Manzhouli line on the 18th, with the aim of securing the strategic points of Boketu and Xing'anling. After the 10th Division arrives, it will continue to advance towards the Harbin-Suifenhe and Harbin-Manzhouli lines. The headquarters of the two divisions will also be set up at important points on the east and west lines. The Japanese army is almost in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Since Li Du's Self-Defense Army saw that the Japanese army was in a state of panic, he ordered Chen Dongshan's regiment to cooperate with Liu Wankui's Salvation Army to attack Fangzheng County on the evening of the 13th. They immediately entered while the Japanese army was unprepared and burned four Japanese planes because they could not take off in time. The Japanese army, led by Hasebe, cooperated with the bandit army of Shencheng and retreated to Gaoli Maozi. Fangzheng was thus recaptured by the righteous army. Although Yilan has been bombed for days and the town hall and radio station have been destroyed, the base of the Self-Defense Army has been moved to Fujin, and the radio station has also been moved there, communicating normally since the 12th. Ma Zhanshan sent a telegram from Heihe to Li Du on the 12th, saying that he had safely arrived in Heihe and that his troops were in order and would not return to the province for the time being. The Heilongjiang army has been concentrating towards the lower Jiang Tangyuan area, so the Japanese believe that Ma and Li Ding are cooperating to resist Japan again. The Salvation Army on the Harbin-Suifenhe line has advanced to Gaoling Station. The Xi Qia bandit army has fled at the sound of the wind. Wherever the Salvation Army goes, they can maintain military reputation and are extremely loved by merchants and civilians. Above Hengdaohezi, there are 50,000 International Communist Army Red Guards who recently advanced to the Sandao Dongzi bordering Suifenhe. All sides are filled with anti-Japanese voices. The Russo-Japanese war is getting closer and closer. (14th)</p>
<p>Between Japan and Russia</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Beginning of Hostility <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Russia's Plot to Destroy the CER Has Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>Japanese Plane Stolen, Japanese Army Hastens to Deploy Defenses</p>
<p>Russia Increases Troops to the Far East to 150,000</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Two shocking pieces of news have emerged here in the past two days. One is that the Second Songhua River Railway Bridge on the Harbin-Changchun line of the CER was almost blown up, which was later proven to be the work of Soviet railway workers. The other is that a Japanese plane stationed in Harbin was stolen by a Red Russian worker and flown to Russia. The occurrence of these two events and the active military preparations of the Soviet Union in the Far East are sufficient to prove that the relationship between Japan and Russia is deteriorating day by day. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>The Second Songhua River Bridge was located between the Laoshaogou and Taolazhao stations on the Harbin-Changchun line. It was built in the 18th year of the Republic of China at a cost of more than 3 million gold rubles and was the second largest project of the CER. At 2:00 AM on the 9th of this month, six or seven Russians secretly walked on the ice from the north bank of the river to the foot of the bridge. Two people held hand-held machine guns, and the rest held box cannons. They placed explosives, five poods (about 150 pounds), under the eighth and ninth piers. While they were working, a White Russian road patroller saw them and was killed. The soldiers guarding the bridge heard gunshots and saw several figures under the bridge and opened fire. The soldiers guarding the gun emplacements at both ends of the bridge also came out to assist. The Russians fled in a panic. A person named Panasevich was captured because he fell behind. A CER employee certificate and important secret code documents were found on his body. Later, two li of detonating cord and 60 pounds of explosives and a pistol were found in the forest on the shore. In addition, there were several kinds of dry rations. Because of this incident, trains coming to Harbin from Changchun were blocked for seven hours before traffic was restored. On the afternoon of the 9th, the Japanese military police went to investigate and arrested more than ten Red Russian CER employees at the Taolazhao and Songhua River stations and sent them to Changchun for interrogation. The Japanese side declared that it had fully proven that this incident was a Soviet plot to disrupt Japanese military transportation plans. It was also reported that after this incident, the Japanese side arrested about forty or fifty Red Russian road workers, who were detained and sent to Changchun for interrogation. Although there was no confirmed confession, it has been proven that it was a planned sabotage operation by Red Russia. Since the Soviet Union had misappropriated the railway property, the CER had become useless and they did not want it to be used for Japanese military advantage, so they tried their best to destroy it. The Japanese were therefore on guard against Red Russia.</p>
<p>Red Russian Worker Steals a Japanese Plane: Regarding the incident of a Red Russian worker stealing a plane, the Japanese had stationed the 9th Independent Flying Squadron at the Nangang Airport in Harbin and employed many Red and White Russian workers to fill the tanks and wash the planes every day. At 5:00 AM on the 8th of this month, a new-style monoplane fighter plane parked at the airport was suddenly piloted by a Red Russian worker and flew rapidly along the Harbin-Suifenhe line. When the Japanese heard the news, they immediately sent four planes to chase after it, but because of the difference in speed, they could not catch up. They chased it to Suifenhe and watched it land at four stations before returning. Because of this incident, the Japanese have been arresting Red Russians for days, but they were secretly suppressed for fear of provoking a Red Russian riot. Currently, three Red Russians have been identified as being related to the plane theft and are being detained in the investigation bureau. At the same time, the headquarters of the Second Division of the Japanese Army has gathered its three brigade troops on the Harbin-Suifenhe line to prevent riots by Red Russians along the line and has stopped its plan to attack Yilan. It is reported that another mixed brigade of the Japanese army will be sent to assist in the defense of the eastern section of the CER within the next few days. The Japanese have already recognized Russia as an enemy.</p>
<p>Soviet Red Army Concentrates in Primorsky Krai: The Soviet Red Army in the Far East is concentrating in the Primorsky Krai, totaling 150,000 troops. Military trains on the Masuri Railway are transporting Red Army troops from the Western Siberia area to the Far East. General Galen, the commander-in-chief of the Red Army, has been recalled to the Military Commission to preside over military orders. His successor, General Putna, has arrived, and the headquarters has been moved to Spassk. In the past week, 10,000 cavalry, artillery, and infantry soldiers have been added to Suifenhe. Thirty planes and fourteen tanks are stationed at four stations. The planes take off and practice every day. Their preparations for a fight with Japan have gradually become apparent. According to Japanese investigations, Russia has been secretly smuggling weapons to the northern border of Korea to support Koreans in their restoration movement. Recently, riots have occurred in North Hamgyong Province. There are also communist workers who go to the eastern line of the CER to incite the Chinese to resist Japan. Plainclothes military spies come and go between Suifenhe and Muling every day, conveying messages. The Far Eastern Red Army has a propaganda team that specializes in propaganda for the war against Japan. They have printed a book called "The Way of the Warrior", which records the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese military equipment. The Bolyi Radio Station broadcasts in Japanese and Korean every night, translating workers' riots and opposition to imperialism. Therefore, the Japanese preparation against Russia is more urgent than against us. It is said that the Second Foreign Fleet's return to Lushun is for this reason. (13th)</p>
<p>Japan Tries Hard to Ease Tensions with Russia</p>
<p>The Japanese Newspaper Says Not to Provoke Major Disputes</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun said that rumors of deteriorating relations between Japan and Russia have been rampant. The Russian army has been deploying large armies to important areas such as Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and Blagoveshchensk, with a troop strength of 200,000. The Vladivostok government is actively purchasing food from Manchuria, gradually revealing its preparations for war against Japan. It also incites soldiers and bandits in Manchuria to resist Japan. It is still difficult to predict the future of Japan and Manchuria. However, after the Manchurian Incident, Russia suddenly published the documents exchanged between Japan and Russia, and the seriousness of the situation is already difficult to conceal. Russia's interests in the Far East are the same as those of our country. Now Manchuria, which is the lifeline of Japan, and Russia's Far East interests have become incompatible. Therefore, our country's Far East policy has been restrained by Russia. Therefore, our country cannot tolerate the existence of Russia in northern Manchuria. However, once Japan and Russia turn against each other, Russia will definitely use fierce means against us. At this time, our country should be extremely cautious and not provoke major disputes. Because today our country is deeply unfavorable in the international situation, if the sympathy of the great powers is concentrated on Russia, our country will inevitably be in a state of isolation. The most worrying thing is that if the power factions in Manchuria change their attitude and show goodwill to Russia, a major problem will fundamentally occur in our country's policy towards Manchuria.</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily in this port said that the Labor-Peasant Representative Department issued strong remarks in Geneva yesterday. Our (Japanese) Army authorities issued the following statement regarding the expression of Labor and Peasants: Recently, the Soviet powerful news service regarded the train derailment incident in northern Manchuria as a conspiracy by the Japanese military department to expand the scope of the dispute so that the Japanese army could increase its troops in northern Manchuria. However, our military department is still cautious in order to maintain peace in the Orient.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Xiong Xiling Writes to Director Wang to Refute False Accusations <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Wang Said That the Twenty-One Demands Were Countersigned by Xiong</p>
<p>Xiong Corrects Based on Facts, Hoping That Wang Will Not Be Misled</p>
<p>Ping News: Xiong Xiling recently sent a letter to Wang Jingwei, Director of the Executive Yuan: Director Jingwei, Greetings. Yesterday, I saw in the "World Daily" of the 14th of this month that Director Wang of Luoyang Zhen issued a report at the Central Memorial Week meeting, saying that Xiong Xiling and others were guilty of past crimes and would be severely punished. Also, according to a letter from a friend in Luoyang, Director Wang said in the report at the Memorial Week meeting that the Twenty-One Demands to Japan in 1915 were signed by Yuan Shikai and countersigned by Xiong Bing-san, a member of the current National Crisis Conference, who is still in Shanghai. If he arrives here, we will kill him. I was very surprised when I read this. I remember meeting Mr. Tang Shaoyi in Shanghai in 1919 of the Republic of China. Mr. Tang said, "Mr. Bingsan, you and I are both sinners of the Republic of China." At that time, I deeply admired Mr. Tang's broad and enlightened attitude as a great politician, and the older generation's habit of taking the blame was unattainable. Since I once participated in the government of the Republic of China, I have deeply realized the evil of politics and political parties. Therefore, for the past sixteen years, I have lived in seclusion in the forest and engaged in social work, hoping to avoid wronging the country in my conscience. However, I cannot help but correct the section of what you said about the Twenty-One Demands being countersigned by me, because 1915 was the fourth year of the Republic of China. I had already resigned as Prime Minister of the State in March of the third year of the Republic of China, more than a year ago. Who was the person who countersigned it? You can check the government gazette to know the mistake. At this time of serious foreign negotiations, you are both a political leader and responsible for the survival of the entire country. It seems that you need to carefully review the archives and be cautious. If there is the slightest negligence, you will inevitably harm the country. The accusation of falsely accusing people and wanting to kill them is a minor matter. Although I have sworn sixteen years ago that I will never engage in politics or join any party, I will still be consistent with the government out of my patriotic conscience in the face of this national crisis, and I am willing to be as loyal as Yue Wu Mu. I dare to be loyal and advise you to be clear about it. I also wish you peace, Xiong Xiling, April 16.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Liu He Meets in Xinyang <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Jointly Discussing Bandit Suppression in Henan and Hubei</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Pacification Commissioner of the Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi Border Area, and Zhang Fang, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army, needed to discuss the issue of jointly suppressing border bandits in Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan with He Cheng-jun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, so they traveled from Nanyang and Huangchuan to Xinyang and arrived in Hankou at dawn on the 17th. Concrete measures for bandit suppression in Henan and Hubei were discussed. They were about to return to their respective defenses when Liu Zhi, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Henan, arrived in Xinyang on patrol on the 19th and sent a telegram inviting He to meet. He then took Liu, Zhang, and He Jingwu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Administration, and others north by car on the 20th. It was heard that after He and others arrived in Xinyang, they would discuss the results of the bandit suppression negotiations in Hankou with Liu Zhi in detail again. He stayed in Xin for a day or two before returning to Hankou. Liu, Liu, and Zhang also returned to their respective defenses after Xin was separated. When He and others went north, they made a statement to the press. He said, "The national crisis is severe, and the bandits are rampant. The first priority is to stabilize the country. The bandits in the border areas of Hubei and Henan use the terrain to exploit each other. They have not been eliminated for many years because the suppression has not been unified. This trip is in response to the invitation of Director Liu Jingfu to discuss the bandit suppression plan and will return to Hankou in a day or two." Liu said, "Director He went to Xin to discuss the bandit suppression matters in the two provinces with Director Liu and others. No meetings will be held, and the date of the joint suppression has not yet been determined." Zhang said, "The redization of southern Henan is very deep. We are currently implementing both suppression and appeasement. After the consultation between Directors He and Liu, the future can be more optimistic. It has been decided to move the refugees in Shangcheng to the counties north of the Yellow River according to the plan I proposed in the 18th year, with three to five hundred people settled in each county. The Henan Provincial Government has allocated 20,000 yuan to handle this matter." According to Ma Lingfu, the chief counselor of the Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi Border Area Pacification Commissioner's Office, this time Supervisor Liu and Commander-in-Chief Zhang came to Hankou to discuss the plan for the joint suppression in the four provinces of Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Sichuan with Director He. A decision has been made on the joint suppression of Hubei and Henan, but the deployment of troops and the funding still need to be discussed in Xin. On the other hand, the authorities in Sichuan and Shaanxi were telegraphed to send troops to assist in the suppression, so as to eliminate them all at once. (April 20)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Relief Efforts in Northern Anhui Province Involve Selling Relief Wheat <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Delayed Distribution of Emergency Relief Stirs Resentment</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu reports that last winter, the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, recognizing the extraordinarily severe disaster situation in northern Anhui, specifically allocated 6,730 tons of American wheat for emergency relief. Later, another 1,200 tons were allocated specifically for work relief. Before long, the Shanghai war erupted, and transportation was disrupted. Only a small amount of relief wheat arrived, causing delays in distribution. To address the emergency, the committee decided to convert some of the American wheat into cash in Shanghai so that funds could be disbursed simultaneously. Moreover, to ensure comprehensive consideration and oversight, local relief officials were strictly prohibited from arbitrarily altering the price of relief wheat to prevent corruption. However, after the relief wheat arrived in Bengbu, the Northern Anhui Relief Office actually sold 2,000 tons of it to the Mai Xing Flour Mill. This caused widespread resentment. Northern Anhui is a wheat-consuming region with mills everywhere. If the suffering people could receive relief wheat, they could grind it into flour and survive, regardless of its quality. Unexpectedly, the emergency relief that was supposed to have been provided last winter has been delayed until now. Only half of the relief wheat has been distributed, and 2,000 tons of it have been sold to the flour mill. It is said that the selling price was a little over 82 yuan per ton, which is about 4,000 yuan less than the price in the interior for every hundred tons. The loss from the 2,000 tons is estimated to be about 80,000 yuan. When the Northern Anhui Relief Office distributed relief supplies to various counties, they were stingy with the relief wheat but insisted on providing cash. Moreover, each county received tens of catties less per ton of wheat. As a result, public opinion was in an uproar. Furthermore, representatives from sixteen counties recently went to Bengbu to request relief wheat, planning to quickly transport it back and distribute it. However, the Northern Anhui Office insisted on issuing cash instead of wheat. The representatives argued that the interior lacked food supplies and that even with cash, it would be difficult to save lives. They were forced to use the funds they received to purchase sorghum, wheat, or flour in Bengbu and transport it back to the disaster areas. Consequently, everyone said that the office was using the disrupted transportation of wheat as an excuse to sell it. Why was it that the transportation of flour, wheat, and sorghum purchased by the counties was not disrupted? Moreover, selling relief wheat in Bengbu wasted time and money, causing the disaster areas to suffer even greater losses. Also, the relief representatives from various counties believed that the local officials in charge of relief were mismanaging the process, delaying relief efforts, and were suspected of colluding to embezzle relief funds. Under the weight of their grievances, they also pleaded with the Northern Anhui Flood Relief Association to uphold justice and advocate for the more than seven million disaster victims based on the facts. After receiving the report, the Relief Association has submitted a report to the Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Committee, requesting that it issue a telegram ordering the Northern Anhui Relief Office to promptly and diligently handle the transportation and storage of goods in order to save the disaster victims.

<p>Water Police Patrol and Capture Bandits – Songjiang Dispatch: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, bandits in various places have been gradually plotting to engage in criminal activities. The Taihu gang of bandits has also taken the opportunity to sneak into the coastal ports of Songjiang and Jinshan, specializing in kidnapping. In addition to deploying additional patrol boats at strategic points in his defense area, Fan Guozhong, captain of the first team of the Water Police of the Provincial Public Security Force, personally led patrol officers Zhong Changfa and others on patrol boats along the coast on the 14th. On the 17th, in the Caojing area, they learned that Qin Bangbei, Wang Shide, Zhou Ziyuan, and other Anhui bandit leaders wanted by the Jiangxi and Zhejiang authorities were hiding there. They immediately surrounded and captured them without making a sound and took them back to the team headquarters for preliminary interrogation. According to Qin Bangbei, he had committed many crimes in the jurisdiction of the second and third districts of the Water Police. Because he was wanted by Jiangxi and Zhejiang, he was temporarily hiding in his hometown. Wang Shide also frankly admitted to committing multiple robbery cases. He said that since he had been captured, he should be executed quickly. Zhou Ziyuan confessed that he was also known as Shaoming and that he had robbed a ship in the Yuhui area, taking 840 yuan. Captain Fan, considering the importance of the bandits, immediately dispatched officers to escort the three men to the Minhang District Headquarters for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>A Deadly Robbery Occurs in Dongdun Town – Gaoyou Dispatch: The Daxing Grain Store, owned by merchant Zhang Bao from Dongdun Town, about fifteen li northeast of Gaoyou City, was suddenly attacked by six bandits armed with guns on the night before last. The store employees immediately fled through the back door to report to the owner. Zhang's eldest son, Youfu, led his younger brother to the store and saw that the bandits had already robbed the store and fled, firing their guns along the way as a warning. Youfu and his brother followed in pursuit for less than a li and managed to capture one bandit. The three of them wrestled together and fell into the river, drowning together. Zhang Bao reported the case to the county yesterday, stating that the money in his store had been robbed by the bandits and that both of his sons had been killed. He requested a strict investigation and arrest of the criminals. Smugglers Import Large Quantities of Japanese Goods – Zhenjiang Dispatch: Since the cessation of hostilities in Shanghai, large quantities of Japanese goods have been imported through Shanghai. Merchants in various ports along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway have also taken the opportunity to purchase goods. Recently, it was reported that a package with the number 4537 was sent from Changzhou Qiantai Chang to Gaozi Heji, containing Japanese goods. It was also reported that a large number of Japanese goods from a certain Zhenjiang merchant would arrive within a few days. The Zhenjiang Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has secretly dispatched inspectors to the riverside station to intensify surveillance.</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang Sworn in as President of Zhejiang University – Hangzhou Dispatch: Shao Peizi, the president of National Zhejiang University, requested to resign from his position. After approval, the Ministry of Education announced the appointment of Cheng Tianfang as his successor. After accepting the appointment, Cheng arrived in Hangzhou in late March. The university's monthly expenses were 65,000 yuan, with 30,000 yuan allocated by the central government and the remainder subsidized by Zhejiang Province on a monthly basis. After the Shanghai Incident, the central government accumulated arrears for three months, and Zhejiang Province also experienced arrears in payments to various agencies for several months, causing considerable difficulties. Therefore, Cheng and Zhou Junyan, the director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, met to discuss ways to raise funds. Cheng then went to Beijing to personally report the difficulties. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance agreed to allocate some funds to maintain operations. Cheng returned to Hangzhou from Beijing and held a swearing-in ceremony in the university auditorium at 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 21st). Chen Bu** was sent by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to supervise the ceremony. Li Peien, Xu Shaodi, and forty other people attended. After the ceremony, President Cheng was sworn in. Then, Chen, representing the central government, delivered a speech. Guests such as Yang Mianzhong gave speeches. Cheng's response included three key points: university education should include (1) character education, (2) academic education, and (3) vocational education. He took office in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Qingpu Organizations Request Rent Exemption: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to heavy administrative expenses and insufficient budget, issued a notice to all counties to collect two months' rent to supplement funds. After receiving the order, the Qingpu administrative authorities began investigating and implementing the policy. However, due to the severe damage caused by last year's floods and the economic devastation caused by the recent invasion of the Japanese, various people's organizations have sent telegrams to the province requesting a halt to the rent collection. It is reported that Qiu Shaoxian, Dai Yiqun, Zhang Ziyi, and 240 other members of the Qingpu Shanghai Fellow Association have also jointly telegraphed the province, appealing for the revocation of the order.</p>
<p>Famine-Stricken People Cause Disturbances in Changshu – Changshu Dispatch: Famine-stricken people in the Fushan area of this county, due to last year's famine and the recent lack of production, have gathered to cause disturbances. The authorities, recognizing the hardship of the farmers, did not want to suppress them. However, the disturbances have become more intense, with incidents of people gathering to rob rice and beat others. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, Wen Genfu, who was a boatman from He Cai Town, happened to be at home when he saw a group of more than a thousand famine-stricken people approaching. When he tried to stop them, he was beaten. He was covered in blood and on the verge of death. He was carried to his boat and sent to the Jishan Hospital in the city for treatment. It is reported that his life is in danger. At the same time, eight or nine other people were seriously injured in the area.</p>

<p>Enticing Women to Jiading</p>
<p>To Provide Pleasure to the Heinous Japanese Army, the Women Cried and Refused</p>
<p>The Police Have Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Xia Ma, a Ningbo woman residing at a certain address on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, colluded with local resident Ni Ada and Ningbo native Ma Chaonian to entice Chinese women to work as hostesses at a newly established wine shop in Yangshupu for a monthly salary of 20 to 30 yuan. From the 18th to the 21st of this month, they deceived women to go to Jiading to provide pleasure to the Japanese army and profit from it. They opened room 16 at the Sanjiang Hotel at 12 North Hai Road and successively tricked women such as Zhang Chen, Zhuo Lin, Huang Zhang, Liu Huang, Liu Gu, and Chen Lu into the hotel to negotiate. The women were unaware of the situation and agreed to go to work. At noon on the 20th, Xia Ma borrowed a car and went to meet with Bao Yunmo, a Japanese man, at 132 Kaobazi Road. Ma Chaonian acted as the interpreter, falsely claiming that the women needed to be examined by a doctor in Yangshupu to determine if they were suitable for employment. Two cars were hired, and six other women went along. Unexpectedly, they drove straight to Jiading. After getting out of the car, the women were taken to a Nanyang Hotel to stay. Soon after, plainclothes Japanese men and soldiers came upstairs, teasing the women and trying to dance with them and commit indecent acts. The women were horrified and realized they had been deceived. They cried and refused. The hotel waiter secretly reported the incident to the nearby Japanese military headquarters, who sent someone to take the women back to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the six women, including Zhang Chen, and Xia Ma were sent back in cars. On the way, they got off at North Sichuan Road, and the women argued with Xia Ma. Detective Xiao Erfu, Chinese detective Liu Decheng, and Chinese constable No. 2762 heard the commotion and inquired about the situation. They took Xia Ma to the Hongkou Police Station. Xia Ma confessed that Ni Ada lived at 27 Zilaihu Street in the French Concession and Ma Chaonian lived at 113 Daqing Lane on Nanjing Road. The police secretly arrested Ni and Ma and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the First Special District Court presented the case and requested a trial. Zhang Chen and the other six women testified about what happened and confronted Xia Ma, Ni Atai, and Ma Chaonian. Their statements were evasive. Bao Yunmo, a Japanese man residing at 132 Kaobazi Road, claimed to be in the coal business and had known Ma Chaonian for four years. He said that because many young soldiers in the Jiading army liked women, he entrusted Ma Chaonian to find them. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered the three defendants to remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Private Electricity Association held a provisional meeting at 25 Central Road, 3rd floor, in this port on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. More than forty representatives from various companies, including Li Yanshi, Ye Yangwu, Han Yimin, Yang Yunong, Li Shuxiong, Gao Luqun, and Yang Boan, elected Han Yimin as chairman. The agenda included (1) the situation of Zhejiang Province collecting national crisis donations and the association's petition to Hangzhou, as well as the investigation of the national crisis donation situation for various industries. For example, the Zhejiang Telegraph Bureau claimed that the Ministry ordered that telegraph fees be charged uniformly throughout the country, and Zhejiang could not be an exception. No tariffs were charged on Shanghai-Hangzhou trains and long-distance telephones. To show consideration for public officials, the Provincial Government ordered its subordinates to collect only once, and those below 40 yuan were exempt. The Hangzhou City rent was approved by the Provincial Government to be reduced by 30% of the original amount, starting in April. (2) The Zhejiang business tax was increased to 10 per mille. (3) The Provincial Government's resolution to collect the Yongjia Puhua Electric Light Combustion Education Donation has been submitted to the Executive Yuan Construction Committee by the Association. After Zhejiang Province Government argued reasonably, it resolved that the Provincial Government’s resolution to collect 10% of public utilities for the national crisis donation for a period of one year is about to be implemented. How should we respond? It was resolved that (1) the electricity national crisis donation should be reduced by 5%. (2) The collection period should be extended from one year to two years, but it should be stated that if the national crisis is resolved, the collection should be stopped. (3) State-owned enterprises such as trains and telegraphs should be collected uniformly when they are collected. (4) This special donation is for the national crisis, and other donations should not be used as precedents. (5) The Wuxing Electric Company proposed that electricity users who heard that the national crisis donation would be collected reported the suspension of lights and requested that the lines be cut, reaching 10% of the total amount. How should we provide relief? It was resolved to investigate the situation of various companies and then ask the government to provide relief through the association. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>According to Huadong News, the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau has seven departments and one office, which is quite large in scale and has considerable expenses. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Shanghai's commerce and finance have not been able to recover temporarily. Yang Jianping, the director of the bureau, felt that the scale should be reduced, and personnel should be cut to save expenses and strengthen the work of employees at the same time. He has submitted an approval to the Ministry of Communications to reduce the heads of the Savings Department, which has simpler matters, and the heads of the Insurance Department, which is still drafting regulations. The Secretary's Office was merged into the General Affairs Department, and one chief secretary and two secretaries were dismissed. All deputy department heads were dismissed, and the director of the Remittance Department was appointed to concurrently serve as the head of the Savings Department, and the director of the General Affairs Department was appointed to concurrently serve as the head of the Insurance Department.</p>

<p>The China Land Reclamation Bank has collected sufficient capital of 2.5 million yuan in national currency. It was founded by giants in the financial circles of this port, Cha Runqing, Wang Boyuan, Xu Ji**, Li Fusun, Zhou Zongliang, and Liang Chen**. After three years of establishment, branches were established in Tianjin and Ningbo, and a branch was established at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Meibai Road in this port. Warehouses were established in various places, dedicated to serving the community. The business has been very developed. Previously, due to the increasing scale of the bank, the original site of the head office was insufficient for office work. The board of directors decided to purchase a base at the corner of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road and build an eight-story new-style mansion. Construction began in January of this year. Due to the Shanghai war, transportation was blocked, and the project was slightly delayed. After transportation resumed, the construction of the house project has been actively underway, and it is still expected that the entire project will be completed in the spring of next year and formally moved in to facilitate customers. The plan of the new house of the bank is as shown above.</p>

<p>The junction of North Xizang Road and the ** Concession is not on that road, but five zhang west of that road, which is in Gongyi ** and Huatongfang. During this Shanghai war, the Public Works Department sent craftsmen to erect barbed wire along the sidewalk on the west side of North Xizang Road in front of each store, completely enclosing the stores in the wire. The ** gate at the intersection of Alabato Road ** ** is also not installed at the boundary. Now the iron gate is closed, causing the Chinese taxpayers in the area ** to be unable to be assisted by the patrols of the ** Concession. The Hongyuanlou Restaurant, which is located in the concession, was also unable to reopen. The Wanli **, Tonghe, Liquanchi, Yuanda, and Wanjia **, and more than twenty other shops on North Xizang Road that were ** by the barbed wire, jointly sent a public letter with signatures and seals to the Chinese Taxpayers Association in the concession, requesting them to forward the letter to the Public Works Department for the immediate removal of the barbed wire. If the Public Works Department believes that it cannot be removed now, please move it to the boundary to facilitate the reopening of businesses and prevent accidents. Yesterday, the Chinese Taxpayers Association received a reply stating that: "We have received your joint letter of April 15, requesting us to forward the letter to the Public Works Department to remove the barbed wire, etc. We have informed the Public Works Department and replied to the requesting parties to check and inform the joint signatories."

<p>After the devastating floods in the Jianghuai and Yunhan areas, the surviving people have nothing to live on.

Those who plant ** will not be harvested until September and October. During these months, ** can hardly be avoided. According to reports from various disaster areas, the spring famine has reached such a degree that in the disaster areas of Hubei, **diancai, **shi, and Qingshan, 300,000 disaster victims cannot maintain their lives and are on the verge of starvation. In the counties of Hao, Yingshang, and ** Fuyang in northern Anhui, the roots of grass and leaves of trees have been consumed, and more than 100 people die of starvation and poisoning every day.

<h3 id="e101">Urging the Abolishment of Inner Harbor Licenses for Steamships <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry Order Has Been Promulgated for Over a Year, Yet the Customs Has Not Complied</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Communications, Requesting Consultation and Implementation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Communications yesterday, requesting the implementation of the abolition of special inner harbor licenses for steamships to benefit shipping merchants. The telegram reads: "To Your Excellency, the Ministry of Communications in Luoyang: On the 20th of this month, according to a letter from the Inland Steamship Industry Association, a letter from the Tongyuan Steamship General Bureau, a member of the association, states that there has been a notorious practice of domestic commercial steamships navigating inland rivers being required to exchange for inner harbor licenses. This decree is tantamount to tying one's own hands and feet. Various local industry groups have repeatedly appealed for its abolition, but it has not been approved. It was not until May of last year that Instruction No. 1699 of the Ministry of Communications was received, stating that the association's request to abolish the exchange of special inner harbor licenses for domestic commercial steamships to facilitate shipping merchants, etc., had been approved on April 3rd. Now, after consultation between the Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided that henceforth, any domestic vessels that have already been issued a Ministry license may, after verification by the Customs, be exempt from being issued a ship's badge or river port special license and river license to avoid complexity. In addition to the revision of the regulations for the registration and licensing of steamships, which was announced and implemented on the 3rd of this month, this is urgently ordered for your information, etc. Subsequently, on May 11th, various newspapers also revealed a public notice from the Ministry of Communications with the same intention as the instruction. The decree is clear and unambiguous, but the Jianghai Customs, just ten days after the publication of this Ministry order, on May 13th, requested verification of all matters regarding our Bureau's Tongyi small steamer, still according to precedent, and ordered the payment of ten taels of silver for the inner harbor license fee, issuing a receipt as proof. Initially, it was thought that it had not been long since the Ministry of Communications announced this decree abolishing inner harbor licenses, and the Jianghai Customs may not have received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, and therefore had not implemented it. Unexpectedly, afterwards, a total of seven of our Bureau's Flying Cloud, Cun'an, and other steamers requested verification successively, and all were required to exchange for inner harbor licenses, and the license fees collected ranged from twenty taels for larger vessels to five taels for smaller vessels. To this day, they still disregard the laws and regulations that have been consulted and promulgated by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance, and their restrictions on Chinese vessels and obstruction of inland river traffic are unparalleled. A copy of the Ministry of Communications' instruction notice and a receipt for the Jianghai Customs' collection of the inner harbor license fee for our Bureau's Tongyi small steamer have been combined into a film and sent for your review. We request that your association forward a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it submit it to the Ministry of Communications for approval to consult with the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs that inner harbor licenses, which have long been explicitly abolished, must not be exchanged in violation of the order, and license fees must not be collected, in order to respect the law, etc." Upon arriving at the meeting, it was thought that this notorious practice of inner harbor licenses, which harms merchants and afflicts the people, has already been abolished by a Ministry order and should no longer exist. The Jianghai Customs has been ordered for nearly a year, but has delayed implementation without knowing why. Therefore, we dare to send this letter with the facts and attach a photography, and humbly request your association to submit it to the Ministry of Communications for approval to consult with the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs that these inner harbor licenses, which have already been explicitly abolished, must not be continued, and license fees must not be collected, in order to comply with the law and benefit transportation. This is for the public good, etc. Upon arriving at the meeting, it was found that steamships only need to have a Ministry license to be allowed to navigate, and there is no need for the Customs to issue ship badges or river port special licenses and river licenses. This is in accordance with Instruction No. 1699 of Your Ministry, and Announcement No. 1 was issued by Your Ministry on May 11th of last year. This case has been promulgated for nearly a year, so why do the affiliated Customs offices still resist implementing the Ministry order and still issue licenses and collect fees? Furthermore, according to Announcement No. 1 of Your Ministry, this case was originally submitted by the Inspector General of Customs, so the Customs offices have no excuse to secretly obstruct it. The previous situation in the letter is even more surprising. It is reasonable to cable Your Ministry for review and approval, and to immediately consult with the Ministry of Finance to notify the Jianghai Customs and other Customs offices throughout the country to strictly comply with the case of abolishing special licenses last year, in order to comply with government orders. This is for the public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Tong Sanmao Cannot Escape Criminal Responsibility in the Huang Baiying Suicide Case <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Probation Can Be Granted If He Is Suffering from an Illness</p>
<p>The Opinion of the Police Lawyer</p>
<p>Last summer, the dancer Huang Baiying was induced by Tong Sanmao to take a car to Wusong for coolness. On the way back, Tong obtained silver dollars from Huang to buy sleeping pills and went to the Cangzhou Hotel. Initially, they planned to commit suicide together. However, after Huang took the poison, she suddenly did not want to die and hired a car to take her to the hospital. After the doctor's rescue, she was able to survive. The police learned of the incident and, after investigation, prosecuted Tong for instigating suicide. The First Special District Court sentenced Tong to two years of imprisonment. Tong refused to accept the judgment and appealed. As a result, the appeal was rejected. Tong then appealed to the Supreme Court, which finally ordered the case to be sent back to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for retrial in January of this year. This twist has taken a year and a half. Tong contracted lung disease in prison, which has become increasingly serious. He was granted medical parole. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the retrial of the case. Tong and his lawyer arrived on time, but Huang Baiying was not seen because her address had changed and she could not be summoned. Subsequently, Judge Yu and Assessors Zhao and Guo, together with the prosecutor and Secretary Qian Qizhong, took their seats for the trial. First, police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, followed by questioning Tong Sanmao. However, Tong's voice was extremely low due to his illness. The judge believed that the contents of the case had been clarified after several trials, so he briefly questioned him and then ordered the debate to begin. Therefore, the police lawyer stated that the case was prosecuted for the crime of instigating suicide. The first trial believed that the facts were true and the crime was real, so he was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. However, the defendant argued that he intended to die together. After investigating the methods of instigating suicide, there are several types. After reviewing the facts of the case, the defendant used intimidation and verbal stimulation to cause Huang to commit suicide. Although Huang was sent to the hospital afterwards, this cannot be considered a cessation of behavior, but rather a repentance of previous wrongs. Tong has been imprisoned for more than a year and has been ill. If the judge is particularly lenient and grants him probation, it is possible. If he still does not accept criminal responsibility, it is difficult to deny it. Finally, Tong Sanmao's lawyers, Xu Fuji and Liu Shifang, successively defended him. The court ordered the sentence to be pronounced on the afternoon of April 29th.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yang Shengzhi's Concubine Sues for Inheritance <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Shizhao Submits a Written Opinion</p>
<p>Yang Shengzhi, a former member of Wang Tianpei's army who rose to the rank of military commander through meritorious service, died of illness on March 21, 1931, leaving behind three concubines and an eight-year-old blind son. The three concubines are Cai Huaxian, the mother of the blind child, Wang Jiazhen, and Hua Xunyang. When Yang was alive, Wang Jiazhen was favored alone, and there was great animosity between her and Cai Hua. After Yang's death, the two women joined forces to exclude Jiazhen, accusing her of adultery, stealing her clothes, refusing to live with her, and cutting off her living expenses, thus forming today's lawsuit. On the fifth day after Yang's death, a meeting of relatives and subordinates was held, and Yan Renshan, the director of the Nanjing Office, handed over a bank deposit slip from the Shanghai Bank of China for 50,000 yuan and three deposit slips from the Zhongnan Bank for a total of 70,000 yuan. It was decided that the deposit slips would be kept by Yang Shengbin, the deceased's younger brother. Subsequently, disputes arose repeatedly in the family, and the deposit slips changed hands and fell into the hands of Cai Huaxian. Later, Shengbin sued and obtained a preliminary injunction from the First Special District Court. Before long, Shengbin and Cai Concubine reconciled and requested the withdrawal of the preliminary injunction. Cai successively went to the two banks and withdrew all the money. Therefore, Wang Jiazhen sued her, resulting in the current lawsuit. The subject of the lawsuit is to demand a one-time alimony payment of 42,000 yuan. Wang is 25 years old this year, and calculating until the age of 60, there are still 35 years. The annual living expenses are estimated at a minimum of 1,200 yuan, so the amount should reach this figure. Wang hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Xiang Xun, while the defendant was represented by lawyer Shan Yuhua. At 11:00 am on the 22nd of this month, Judge Yang Peng appeared in court to try the facts. After Lawyers Xiang and Shan stated the case in turn, Lawyer Zhang separately submitted a written opinion and gave an oral presentation to the judge. The most important points were that the case should take into account the interests of both the plaintiff and the defendant, starting from the protection of the inheritance, and the 120,000 yuan that Cai had already proposed had to be investigated and seized. It was also hoped that the just gentry of Guizhou and those who had friendships with the late military commander Yang would come forward to manage the matter so as to properly handle the aftermath of Yang's death. Judge Yang, based on Lawyer Zhang's opinion of preliminary injunction, questioned the defendant's representative, Lawyer Shan Yuhua, and requested the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The reason was that Wang Jiazhen and Zhao Ruiqi had been defendants in a criminal case in the Jiangning Local Court. The cause of action was the crime of abduction, theft, and stolen goods. There was Volume 102 of the Jiangning Court's Twentieth Year Zi Case for verification. Moreover, since this case has not yet concluded, alimony cannot be requested according to the valid regulations. Even if there were no criminal incidents, the plaintiff had issued a handwritten receipt for the保管 of 10,000 yuan. The defendant is still requesting the return of this 10,000 yuan in the Jiangning Court. How can she request alimony in the Shanghai Court again? As for the plaintiff's request to apply for a preliminary injunction on the property, but she did not point out the location of the property, how can it be seized? The court ordered the submission of a supplementary statement and rescheduled the hearing. The original written opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>The written opinion of Zhang Shizhao, the lawyer and litigation agent for Yang Wang Jiazhen's alimony pursuit case, is to clarify the main points of the case in order to maintain its benefits and fairness. The purpose of this case is the distribution of the inheritance, and the source of the inheritance is the accumulation of a recently famous senior military officer. Unfortunately, after the death of the military officer, there was only one eight-year-old blind son left, and the rest were concubines. Therefore, the plaintiff, Wang Jiazhen, is the fourth concubine, and the defendant, Yang Xiuqian (i.e., the eight-year-old son), is the mother of the son, and Ji Huaxian is the third concubine, and another Hua Xunyang is the fifth concubine. The bedding is flat, and there is no way to say who is virtuous or who is superior. Judging from the situation, this type of family is notoriously lax in discipline. Once the head of the family dies, there is no hope of common maintenance. After the military officer's death, the chief of staff in Nanjing, Yan Renshan, handed over 70,000 yuan in deposits from the Zhongliang Bank and 50,000 yuan from the Bank of China, totaling 120,000 yuan. No matter how this 120,000 yuan is divided, it is undoubtedly the common property of the three concubines. The three or five concubines usually jealous of the plaintiff, even at this time, they took advantage of her isolation to plot to trap her. Finally, there was a case in the capital. On one side, they quietly settled the case, and on the other side, they successively emptied the two banks in the name of the property inheritor (i.e., her son Xiuqian). The concubines are deeply fond of hardship and have many bad habits. In addition, traitors are coveting everything from the side, and there is no way to be self-reliant. Once the 120,000 yuan is in their hands, they will be free to squander it and be forced by others to divide it. It is expected that it will not take long before it will turn into nothing. At that time, it will not belong to the plaintiff, and there will be no source of funds. Even if the Cai Huaxian and other orphans and widows are poisoned, how can they survive on their own? From the perspective of this lawyer, the focus of this case should be on the overall and permanent interests of the family, and the starting point should be the preservation of the 120,000 yuan deposit (and other real estate by analogy). According to the bank report, this money is withdrawn by the heir in accordance with the bank's practice of finding a guarantee, but whether it is easy to use other accounts and still store it in the original bank or transfer it to another bank (the Bank of China's reply to this lawyer's letter is attached), and whether it is stored as a whole or in part, the court should strictly inquire of the defendant and order him to confess one by one, and then the plaintiff should request a declaration of preliminary execution and give it a lien. If the defendant refuses to confess the truth in the name of civil affairs, the court should also order the defendant to provide cash in the amount of 120,000 yuan, or provide a guarantee with a solid shop to serve as a pawn. The outcome of this case depends entirely on the 120,000 yuan, which is at risk of being lost. Once it is lost, everything will be completely gone. The displacement of the plaintiff and defendant in the future will burden relatives and friends, and all will be in the candlelit count. At that time, the law and human relations will be unable to revive the blind. Even if the above-mentioned traitors are in the court, what will it do? Extending to this, the most important meaning of resolving the unresolved case should be to fully protect the inheritance and leave it for surplus, so that the fair gentlemen of Guizhou and those who are well-versed in the friendship with the military commander who died can handle the overall situation and deal with it in the long term. Even if they retreat and distribute the property by person to the three concubines, they are all women who are loyal to the Yang family, and their status is equal to the law and there is nothing low or high. If the current situation is followed, Cai and Hua will embezzle a large amount of money and spend it at will, causing the plaintiff to be frozen and starved and unable to enjoy the benefits of her late husband's wealth. The feelings of righteousness and justice in the world are nothing more than this. It has been found that the two banks' deposits have been appealed by Yang Shengbin, the younger brother of the deceased military commander, to the court's ruling (Preliminary Judgment No. 97 of the 20th year), which allowed a preliminary injunction. The concubines have also sued each other in the Capital Court, and they have all posted cash bail in each case. It seems that the matter of attachment in this case has been witnessed before and is not an abrupt new meaning. Moreover, this attachment belongs to the fixed common living expenses, which is absolutely slow compared to other commercial funds. The defendant may have made a mistake in his chance. The procedure is extremely simple (that is, the applicant for attachment does not need to provide a guarantee, etc.). The court should resolutely implement this first, and then treat the whole case for investigation and treatment. If the defendant makes use of the inheritance qualification of his eight-year-old blind son to collude with close relatives and embezzle all the inheritance for his own use, he obviously harms the plaintiff's property rights and has already constituted the crime of embezzlement under criminal law with a surplus. If you think about it, the defendant is a muddy woman with a large amount of money in her hands. She dares to disregard the restrictions of litigation, and her whereabouts are secretive and migratory. How can there be no treacherous people to protect and bully her for profit? It is also in the interest of the defendant herself that the court should strictly investigate so that the whereabouts of the 120,000 yuan are clearly understood, and the case will begin to have clues to be found. If this is the case, treating this case from the scope of civil affairs to criminal affairs is the path of national law. The humble opinion is that the military commander died not long after building a tooth. His meritorious service is to the country, so that his family can get what they want and there is no scandal in the family. This is what the meritorious friends and relatives want. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat both sides with equal benefits in the law, and it is appropriate to treat both the living and the dead with the same feelings. This is the reason for writing this book. Only the judge will adopt and implement it, and I will not be able to fulfill my great wish.</p>

<p>At around 1:00 am yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 29 Yongji Lane, Tangshan Road. An elderly woman from Jiangbei, Shen (75 years old), was burned to death on the spot. The Fire Department's fire truck rushed to the scene to put out the fire. The Huishan Police Department was informed and ordered detectives to investigate. The body of the elderly woman was carried to the Perin Road Autopsy Room. At around 10:00 am, Li Ying, the prosecutor commissioned by the First Special District Court, arrived at the scene to examine the body. According to Zhou Jiguang, the deceased was his mother and lived with him at the front building of the address. The fire was started downstairs at that time. He heard a quarrel downstairs in the hall, where people were gambling on playing cards. He went downstairs to investigate and ran to the lower floor of the stairs, where he saw a fire. They were scrambling to move things out. Although he tried to put water on the fire, it was ineffective. His wife and children also escaped after hearing the alarm. His elderly mother was old and had difficulty walking, so she could not escape in time. The staircase had been burned down at that time, and he could not rescue her either. Li then ordered the examination to determine that the deceased was a female surnamed Shen and had been burned to death before death. The body was handed over to her son, Zhou Jiguang, who signed for it and took it back for coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Bai Yufu, 26, from Shandong, lives at No. 638 Bao'an Lane, Gordon Road, Shanghai West. His fellow villager Sha Zhaoping, 24, also lives at No. 186 in the same neighborhood. Both are public bus drivers. They are both Muslims and considered childhood friends. However, Bai had resigned and was at home. Two weeks ago, Bai went to Sha's house to gamble on Pai Gow and suddenly had a quarrel with Sha's wife due to teasing.</p>
<p>Sha was on the side at the time and did not take it seriously. Last night at 11:00 pm, Bai went to Sha's place to chat. After a while, Sha invited Bai to go out to a dark place on Xiaoshadu Road. Sha then took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired two shots at Bai's head. One bullet hit the back of his neck, and Bai immediately ran away in pain, shouting for help. He ran into the Gordon Road Police Station to report the situation. Chinese and Western detectives immediately went to Sha's house to arrest him, but Sha had already fled and disappeared without a trace.

<p>Yang Daoqing's Wife Aborted as a Result</p>
<p>Xia Ziyang is Accused of Homicide</p>
<p>Yang Daoqing, 28, from Yancheng, lives at No. 9, Hengchang Lane, Conti Road, in the French Concession. His wife, Xu, felt unwell on the 10th of this month and went to the clinic of Xia Ziyang, a country doctor from the same village, at No. 12, Bao'an Lane, Bail Road, Nanyang Bridge. After Xia felt her pulse, he diagnosed her with menstrual disorder and prescribed a prescription for Xu to take home and boil. However, he did not know that Xu was three or four months pregnant, and the medicine caused her to have an abortion and become ill. Yang believed that Xia was an incompetent doctor who caused the death of his wife, so he hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Second Special District Court, accusing Xia of causing an abortion and injury due to professional negligence, and requesting that the case be investigated and that compensation of 3,500 yuan be claimed. The court summoned both parties to the court yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm for a trial in the third criminal court. First, the plaintiff, Yang Daoqing, stated the previous situation and said that his wife was seriously ill due to the abortion. When questioned, Xia confessed that when the plaintiff's wife came to his clinic for treatment, he inquired in detail and diagnosed her with menstrual disorder, and did not mention that she was pregnant. He also hired lawyer Wang Shizong to defend him and presented his registration certificate from the Health Bureau and the license issued by the French Municipal Council. The court ordered him to deposit 2,000 yuan in cash for bail and wait for a continued hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Peace and Reconstruction <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The national crisis has become so severe that, although more than half of the populace has been awakened from their slumber, and are making a final struggle at this moment of survival, there are still many who hesitate and stray down the wrong path. Look at the soldiers who hold onto their weapons for self-interest, the merchants who only seek profit, the traitors who act against the tide, and the national thieves who are inclined to cede sovereignty and humiliate the country – they are all still hesitant!</p>
<p>After this painful experience, we deeply feel that the outbreak of this national crisis is not so much the cause of the Japanese invasion, but rather the result of twenty years of internal strife. The brutality of the Japanese is certainly 可根 (detestable), but if our own people did not fight for power and seize territory, and instead worked together with one heart and one mind to build a strong defense for national defense, would the enemy be able to penetrate our territory and seize our throat? Let's not dwell on the past. From now on, all compatriots across the country should move towards the path of [the movement of peace and reconstruction]. However, the so-called [peace] is limited to [internal], not [external]. In other words: [Turn the gun outward] and unite against foreign invaders. This should be the case during this period, and it should be the case forever. How to implement the [peace and reconstruction movement]? This is naturally a very important question. First, all soldiers in the country should thoroughly realize that they should never participate in internal wars again. Second, the entire nation should be organized to supervise [the united action of peace and reconstruction]. Here, I would like to introduce the four methods proposed by Mr. Liu Zhan'en for reference: (1) Establish a national non-war construction pact; (2) Adopt a non-cooperation policy towards those who undermine domestic peace and participate in internal wars; (3) Reward leaders of reconstruction; (4) Emphasize peace and reconstruction propaganda. In addition to these, there are certainly many other methods, but these four points cover a wide range of meanings, and effective regulations can be formulated based on these ideas. For example, the National Crisis Conference passed a National Representative Assembly, and in Shanghai, there is also the initiation of the People's Constitution Advancement Association. If these two groups truly want to take responsibility for saving the country, they urgently need to solve the following two issues</p>
<p>[Implement armed resistance to recover lost territory]</p>
<p>Implement the domestic peace and reconstruction movement</p>

<p>Between Ximen and Fangbang Bridge, there is a triangular open space. For the sake of commemorating the martyr Mr. Yingshi, fellow members of the Kuomintang specially built a high tower here. It stands tall and majestic, and its appearance is extraordinary and awe-inspiring, capable of depicting the martyr's heroic spirit. Not far away, across the street near Xiaobeimen, the French, several years ago, built a fort, shaped like an ellipse. The French are known for producing beautiful women and valuing art. Therefore, the things they build also contain an elegant touch amidst their strength. On the Mingguo Road, these two buildings, embellishing the space between them, stand facing each other from afar. Some say that they are sufficient to represent the characteristics of the two countries. Could this be true?</p>

<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Sound detectors. In recent times, with the development of the air force, there is a deep feeling that air defense is more important than anything else. All kinds of air defense equipment have been devised as preparations, such as aerial sound detectors, nighttime searchlights, alarm transmitters, intelligence devices, etc. They have all emerged based on the experience of past wars. Now, let's first talk about the sound detector among the new weapons. This kind of air defense equipment was invented after World War I. Before the war, the only way to detect enemy aircraft was to listen with human ears. During the war, it was impossible to prevent aircraft from ravaging the area. After the war, a Frenchman first created a trumpet-shaped sound receiver that was attached to both ears. However, the structure of this device could not determine the horizontal angle or vertical angle. Therefore, it was not very effective. Later, it was changed to four, but it was still not accurate enough. Before long, a parabolic aerial sound detector was invented, which was slightly more advanced than the trumpet type. However, aircraft travel at a very high speed, and when using a sound detector to determine direction, the position often differs. Therefore, the time for sound wave transmission was further modified. Later, with the help of electrical linkage devices, six improvements were made. The most notable was the sound detector produced by the American Sperry Corporation, which was based on the trumpet shape and was very precise. Since then, France has improved the parabolic type to create an inner bowl-shaped sound detector. Germany also transformed the trumpet type into an outward-opening, morning glory-shaped sound detector. However, all of the above sound detectors still had their advantages and disadvantages. After various studies, a compromise type was created. It has four narrow and long corners and looks like a box. It is easy to manufacture and has a very high efficiency. However, this type of sound detector still requires human ears to listen and determine direction. Because the feelings of the left and right ears cannot be the same, and because of mental　 (fluctuations), it is impossible to obtain accurate results. Moreover, using this device requires considerable practice, so it is difficult to meet the needs of the times. Recently, the change of sound waves into electric current has been used, and the pointer function of the ammeter is used to precisely distinguish the sound by listening, and the direction of the sound source can be determined by sight. As a result, the effectiveness of the sound detector is very great. Japan currently has 換 (replacement) sound detectors, which are the trumpet type from Taisho 14 (1925). During this Shanghai battle, the Japanese military installed them for defense in the headquarters consulate.</p>

<p>— Wang Tianhen</p>
<p>"Cough! Danger! When did you come out? How did you leave your mother and Xiong'er?" Fortunately, we live in the same alley. I ran out of the house and saw that your front door was wide open, so I went in to close it. I saw your mother and Xiong'er standing in the living room, calling for you but you didn't respond. I called for the nanny, but she didn't respond either. I knew I couldn't delay any longer, so I pulled your mother and Xiong'er out. Because the alley entrance was bombed, we had to walk out of the back alley. As soon as we left the alley, we heard another explosion. I'm afraid our residences have all been bombed!" "Danger!," Qin Jiang said. "Even if they haven't been bombed, can we still go back now? Hurry up and find a place to hide!" the old mother said.</p>
<p>"I didn't even have time to tell you about my experience last night. This place is still dangerous. I need a safe place to settle my mother!" he said.</p>
<p>"Let's escape from Zhabei and go to the concession," Qin Jiang said very simply.</p>
<p>So he didn't care about his fatigue and looked for a way to run to the concession. Fortunately, Qin Jiang had a hundred or so dollars with him, so he was able to take a ferry across the Suzhou River. Everyone finally calmed down, and he had the opportunity to tell his mother about what happened overnight. His mother believed that it was the blessing of their ancestors. After he finished speaking, he continued to think about where to go. He had no money and couldn't stay in a hotel. He thought of several relatives and friends, but he knew that he couldn't stay with any of them. It was still his brother-in-law's house, where there was plenty of space, and Qin Jiang was happy to go there with him. He told his mother and Qin Jiang about it. Qin Jiang was very sympathetic. The same brother-in-law was the best. His mother was a little unwilling, but she couldn't care about so much! After arriving at his brother-in-law's house, everyone's hearts were completely at ease. But as soon as he left the dangerous situation, his patriotic fervor rekindled. He didn't feel the pain on his hands and face. After eating, everyone went to sleep, but he hurriedly went out to inquire and learned that the Chinese army had won a great victory last night. He was overjoyed! He thought: I've lived for decades, and I've never seen the Chinese army fight a foreign army! This is like a dream, the Chinese army actually won a victory! He couldn't help but want to return to Zhabei to witness the traces of victory. He completely forgot about the terror of last night.</p>
<p>His mother naturally disagreed with him returning to Zhabei. He said:</p>
<p>"We didn't bring any money when we escaped, so where will we get money to use? Fortunately, our country won the victory, and Zhabei is still our Zhabei. I'm going back to have a look to see if our house has been bombed, and I'll take the money with me."</p>
<p>His mother thought it was true; but it was late today, so he should go tomorrow morning. So he rested for one night, and the next morning he really went back to Zhabei. Unexpectedly, after he left, his mother waited for two days and still didn't see him return. She was very worried! On the third day, someone sent a letter, and she called Xiong'er to read it to her:</p>
<p>"Our house has been blown to pieces by the evil enemy. How can I not avenge the country and my family? I have decided to join the army and fight the enemy. Mother, please think of me as having already died on the night of January 28th! Fortunately, Mother is safe, and Xiong'er will soon grow up and be able to serve on behalf of your son; if your son doesn't die, he will still come back to serve. Please don't be sad or worried! I don't have much time in the army, so I can't tell you everything in detail. Your son, Zheng Hua, bows." (End)</p>

<p>Continued to depreciate by 3.4 taels. The previous standard gold continued to trade on a small scale, and there were no special changes throughout the day, fluctuating around 3.4 taels. There was a total of 9.5 taels in the difference for the whole day. Although the silver market continued to rise, the exchange rate fell, so it did not fall at the beginning. However, the foreign exchange loosened, and the selling households in the field were strong, so it was seen not to sink. From 712.5 taels, it fell to 03 taels. After a certain bank opened spot goods again, it immediately pulled up 4.5 taels. There were few ups and downs in the later market, and there was a lack of wholesale transactions. The trend was normal. The daily situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning market still had several degrees of hovering. From the opening of the six-month market in the early morning, it added 3 qian to 711.5 taels. The big bars slightly rose by one-sixteenth, and the silver price rose by one-quarter. The grounding was not good, but the US bought in. However, people's hearts were still calm, and it did not fall. Then, after the first entry of 12.5 taels of Fuyu, Daxing, Yongzhi, Feng, Yongfu, Xing, Yongrichang, Yuanmao, Yongyuhe, and the Dalian gang came to sell, and the English gold was also 8 pence ○625 in and out of July. US dollars were still flat. Maihang entered 7.75 out 6875. Soon after, Anda offered June English gold ○625, and the gold price fell by more than 6 taels. At 9:20, it was ○05 taels and 7 qian. Hengyu and Fuyu bought in and immediately raised it by more than 2 taels to ○08 taels and a half. English gold announced a long price of 125. The same was true for US dollars.

Later, Yuankang, Xiangrichang, Yuanmao, Yongwu, etc. sold out, and the 　 was more than 3 taels. However, there was a 1 tael transaction at 10:30, which was ○05 taels and 1 qian. Soon after, Tongtaichang, Qianchang, Xianghong, Kangyongyuan, and Tailai entered and pulled up more than 2 taels, so it was ○07 taels and 8 qian. However, the foreign exchange market was even looser. In July, English gold was calculated at 1.875 to 25, and US dollars in August were 31.9375. Moreover, Yuan Chun, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Xianghe, etc. had a strong desire to sell, and it depreciated by 4.5 taels in half an hour until it finally reached ○03 taels at 11:00. Later, Maihang absorbed June US dollars 75 and a certain bank bought 210 spot strips, and the price was ○05 taels. Hengxing sold out, so it entered the futures market.

At this time, it retreated to 6 taels and 8 qian, and then the market closed at 7 taels and 1 qian. The raised price was changed to 777 taels, a total of 　 About 70 taels.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it entered a deep and mediocre situation. The market opened at 06 taels. Because it was heard that the UK would increase import taxes, it was feared that English gold would tend to rise, but people's hearts seemed to be weak. In a moment, it added 1 tael to 07 taels. 0 households bought in, and then the bills were still loose. English gold was 25 in this month, 1.875 US dollars in July had settled 6875 to 75, and there seemed to be many short positions sold in the market, so it fell by 2 taels to 05 taels. At 2:30, the upper level was seen because Yifeng Yong, Yifeng Zhifeng Yonghengxing, etc. competed to buy it. The May US dollar only settled 4375 to half a dollar, and the market gradually improved. It increased by 4 taels to 09 taels at 3:30. Afterwards, it was seen to soften again, and sellers did not slacken, but there were no large tickets. At more than 4:10, it was 07 taels. Yifeng entered again to 08 taels and 1 qian. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 07 taels and 8 qian, which was 3.4 taels lower than the day before yesterday.

<p>Market Overview: This year, the tea and silkworm season is booming, and the use of foreign coins is at the top of the first half of the year. Last year, the tea and silkworm season went to the stomach for millions or tens of millions. Now, there are only a few hundred thousand or one or two million in the past two or three weeks. It can be seen that the market is bleak. From the current situation, only the bank略有 (slightly) purchased the stomach, but it is weak and not much. The interest rate market is difficult to surpass.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Breakdown [Foreign Interest Rate] In the early market, people's hearts were怠澥 (sluggish) and the selling was successful, so the interest rate was 7 hao and a half lower than the previous noon, at 7 qian, ○03 li and 2 hao and a half. In the afternoon market, it fell another 2 hao and a half to ○03 li. As a result, it decreased by a total of 1 li in order. [Silver Interest Rate] In the early and afternoon markets, it was still 1 qian and 67 fen with water. The bank's listed price was 4 fen, which was roughly the same as the previous day's market situation.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Coin Transactions [Silver Coins] Banks collected and settled more than 3.7 million yuan from the south, more than 3.9 million yuan from Chinese merchants, and more than 3.67 million yuan from various exchange rates, goods tariffs, foreign coins, and mortgage payments. Money houses, public silver companies, and single collections totaled more than 31 million yuan, and the transaction of broken tickets was more than 1.1 million yuan. [Foreign Coins] From the early morning to the afternoon market, 950,000 banknotes and 25,000 notes were made, and 45,000 bank notes were paid. Transactions between banks in the early morning and afternoon markets totaled 700,000 yuan, and more than 900,000 yuan were collected and settled between foreign accounts of various banks. More than 4.3 million yuan in money houses and foreign public bills, and more than 1.1 million yuan in foreign transfer fees.

Transactions of 2,500 jiao were made. The early market for Guangdong minor coins was 6 qian, ○07 li and 2 hao and a half, and the afternoon market was 6 li and a half.

<p>The message from this term is exceptionally boring. For loans, there were only slight transfers by old customers. It was heard that there was a slight embellishment in long-term deposits. Ningbo originally wanted to recover some, but due to the poor market in Shanghai, it could not be compensated and had to be confused. Most of them were probably transferred. Most of the other long-term deposits were still spectators, and even if they were transferred out, they were still within the scope of Chinese financial circles. The discussion of interest rates will have to wait until the 27th or 28th of the month for the internal decision before there is a market price.</p>

<p>The turnover in the bond gray market is extremely rare, which is only seen in the past few days. In fact, the diplomatic situation seems to have taken a turn for the worse, so the market is slightly uneasy, and people's hearts are weak. The gray market is unanimously exhausted. Except for the 19th Customs · Kindness 20th Customs · Compilation Legacy, which fluctuated greatly, other slightly fell, and the layoffs fell by as much as 1 yuan and 67 jiao.

<p>Opening on May 2</p>
<p>With Evidence of Commission</p>
<p>The exchange flower and yarn market has been officially scheduled to resume operations on May 2, which is Tuesday. There is a saying that the commission will be increased, with cotton yarn increasing by 4 taels per 100 pieces, totaling 29 taels, and cotton flowers increasing by 2 taels per 100 dan, totaling 8 taels. However, this issue is still under discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Guangdong Merchants Slightly Stocking Up on Current Yarn <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The actual demand for cotton yarn has increased, as Guangdong merchants are purchasing, but large transactions are still lacking due to financial exhaustion, which is difficult to recover temporarily, resulting in tired morale. Northern merchants are also slightly stocking up, but inland merchants are not active at all. According to the Wuxi Yarn Factory, sales are sluggish and inventories are increasing. It is heard that there is a saying that night work will be stopped, which shows the sluggishness of the business. The Yangtze River area is also exceptionally depressed, and there is also a lot of yarn stored in Hanpu. An investigation of the situation in all directions shows a desolate scene, all due to the severe floods last year, and now the war has started again, causing economic exhaustion. The future of the yarn market is very difficult. It is found that the total purchases of various merchants throughout the day are 800 packages, with 25 packages entering among peers. The price drop is intensifying, and the fine yarn is following the trend. The overall pull is down by 23 taels. The Guangdong guest merchants entered 415 packages, the northern merchants entered 290 packages, Ningbo entered 15 packages, the inland entered 7 packages, and Shenxin Factory opened more than 100 packages.</p>

<p>The cotton market situation is still sluggish and depressed. Because the foreign cotton situation is flat, each factory's attitude towards purchasing raw materials is extremely cold. Due to the urgency of silver and the stagnation of yarn sales, the market price is gradually falling. Moreover, Japanese merchants' warehouses have a huge amount of foreign cotton stockpiles, and there is already an excess for demand. There is a saying that they want to seek to sell it abroad. However, the bottom goods of domestic cotton are exhausted, and Shenxin still has a volume of imports. Yesterday, they purchased another 1,000 packages of fire machine flowers, priced at 30 taels, 0 yuan, 7 qian, and 5 yuan, and sent them to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to smooth spot goods and a good Wall Street, but then returned to weakness. It is estimated that futures fell by 2 to 4 pounds, the sound spot fell by 5 pounds. English cotton futures rose by 9 points, spot goods rose by 7 points.

<p>The Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai have been shut down for more than two months since the war broke out in Shanghai. Seeing that the current situation is easing, they are gradually seeking to restart their operations. According to the Shanghai Daily News, the most difficult problem after resumption of work is still the Yangtze River area. According to observations, the average monthly production of cotton yarn in Shanghai Japanese yarn factories last year was 36,000 packages, and the average monthly production of cotton cloth was 17,000 packages. The export volume last year was 70,000 packages of cotton yarn and 800,000 bolts of cotton cloth. The destinations and quantities of yarn and cloth are listed on the left:</p>

<p>There is little source of water in South Shanghai due to continuous rain. The number of people in the early morning is extremely small. The thick japonica rice market is temporarily in a mediocre position. There is little accumulation of thin rice, and the rural merchants have slight transactions. The market has been lifted by two corners. Early japonica rice from South Port has arrived and sold well. The shape has no honor or disgrace. The changing yuan has been extremely殷 (busy), and the trend is to increase the killing. The number ten in the northern city of Suzhou River is sold well in the city due to the阴雨 (overcast and rainy) weather in the early morning. Each cargo is提 (lifted). In the afternoon, the 斛脚 (Hujiao) is slightly定 (stable). There is no fixed price for rice.

<p>The world's renowned Anhui Qimen black tea is now due to debut. The tea operators in the county were initially affected by the Shanghai battle, and the Shanghai tea industry lost its flexible attitude. They all adopted a passive approach. Now, due to the emergence of new tea and the need to harvest the Guyu Mao Feng in time, the tea houses with capital have the ambition to reorganize and re-emerge. Now, according to a reporter's investigation, most of the tea houses in the southwest river of Qixia and the tea market concentration centers of Shanli, Gaotang, and Tafang have already opened their branches. However, this year, the focus of each number is on the South Road. The original tea numbers in Fu, which belongs to only Dajiang Village and Panchun, are two or three families. The Qiupu tea numbers are not as hot as last year. The reason is that the financial close tea stacks in the mountains receive guests can not盡量 (maximum)放款 (loan). Therefore, those who have no capital, although they want to operate, are often苦 (bitter) in财力 (financial resources). This is the reason why the Qi Fu Qiuhong tea house number is about forty percent less than the old covenant. The number of openings is busy采 (picking)运 (transportation) and now the foreign currency is being prepared for称 (weighing). The嫩尖 (tender tip) before the rain can be采 (picked) and辦 (office).</p>

<p>Taikoo Sugar Market Shape is Relatively Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market reported that Cuban spot prices remained stable. New York December futures were at 0.81, and March next year at 0.8. Javanese raw sugar for April and May was at 6.35, and June at 6.40, showing little fluctuation compared to previous prices. The guild's transactions were scattered. Number 24 raw white sugar was bid at 12 taels and 9 mace, and Hong Kong goods at 12 taels and 8 mace, both receiving little interest. The market outlook is slightly positive, with a small amount of buying, and the market shape appears stable. Raw white sugar was at 12 taels, 5 mace and 5 candareens. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was at 16 taels and 2 mace, DY mark at 15 taels and 3 mace, and HM mark at 13 taels and 7 mace. Both sales and purchases were sluggish, and the market appeared to be holding steady.

<p>The piece goods market has recently shown signs of stagnation. The reasons for this can be attributed to several factors: (1) The unstable political situation and tight financial turnover; (2) Eastern goods from the north are being sold at discounted prices; (3) The year-end closing is approaching soon, leading to unanimous stagnation among local merchants, with market prices gradually declining. However, due to the weather turning warmer, white cloth remains relatively active. Yuanfang goods are still being quoted at the end-of-period price, requiring an increase of two to three candareens. Baoshun Golden Lion sells for 10 taels and a half mace, Taihe Red Chicken for 13 taels, Flying Man Ball for 11 taels and 8 mace, and Losley and Fan for 10 taels and 5 candareens. Goods that can be imported at 10 taels are lacking in the market. Due to the recent high asking price, the sale of Fair Yin Dan Shi Lin bamboo cloth has slowed down. 190 Ganlu opens at 14 taels and 7 and a half mace, 130 at 13 taels and 7 and a half mace, 190 Double Deli at 14 taels and 2 and a half mace, and 130 at 13 taels and 2 and a half mace. 190 Renhu fine cloth is at 12 taels and 9 mace, and 130 at 11 taels and 9 mace.

<h3 id="e143">Trotsky's Nepotism <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>In 1924, Trotsky, in his article "Lessons of the October Revolution," boldly and thoroughly attacked his brother-in-law, Zinoviev, a member of the Central Executive Committee. Of course, this was a so-called "political struggle." As for who was right and who was wrong, we outsiders naturally need not interfere. However, Trotsky, for the sake of his "politics," broke with personal feelings and did not consider his "sister" at all. It is truly worthy of our great surprise. Why is "the political relationship of the country" more important to him than his own "nepotism"?</p>
<p>Foreigners value reason over emotion, while Chinese people value emotion over reason. This is a major difference. "Without someone in the court, don't become an official" has become an aphorism for getting by in the world. So, whoever is "successful in their official career" and becomes a high official, then his brothers-in-law, his in-laws, and whatever else he has, will not have to worry about not having food to eat or not having an official position. The so-called "one person becomes an official, and ten thousand people enjoy the blessings," goes without saying. Everyone with "nepotistic ties" to this high official ascends to heaven like chickens and dogs, and celebrates with their caps. Then, outside of the big "nepotistic relationship," there are small "nepotistic relationships." Outside of the small "nepotistic relationships," there are even smaller "nepotistic relationships." In the meantime, directly and indirectly, implicated and affected, to the point where it is impossible to investigate completely. Such officials can be called "nepotistic officials," which becomes a common practice and infects the whole country, called "a country of nepotism."</p>
<p>This point, in terms of the opportunity for nepotism, in addition to this, there are special rights of nepotistic relationships, and it may be useful to briefly list one or two. Engaging in evil, committing crimes, being greedy and perverting the law, are beyond the reach of national law, first. Once the power and position are high, there are naturally many followers. A centipede, even dead, does not fall down, second. Foreign houses, giant mansions, and luxurious residences are connected to the clouds, and beautiful concubines and delicate wives compete to show off, third. Reason can sometimes indeed overcome emotion, but on this point, emotion can indeed overcome reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is inevitable that Trotsky, due to political conflict, thoroughly attacked his brother-in-law, which is too unsympathetic. It is inevitable that Zinoviev was too unwise to be attacked by Trotsky due to political conflict.</p>

<p>— Liu Tiya</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, having nothing to do in seclusion, I have composed more than sixty doggerel verses on current affairs. I have copied ten of them here, hoping that they will be published.</p>
<p>Ode to Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>At a young age, became a marshal,</p>
<p>For thousands of years, a lesson in learning righteousness.</p>
<p>Power divided into three legs of a tripod,</p>
<p>Authority paralleled a dictatorial king.</p>
<p>Had a dream, lost in the butterfly,</p>
<p>Homeless, returned to Shenyang.</p>
<p>Prosperity and decline are inherently uncertain,</p>
<p>A boy too absurd.</p>
<p>Elegy for the Zhabei Battlefield</p>
<p>The earth experienced war,</p>
<p>Everything turned into rubble.</p>
<p>Poor children search through the wreckage,</p>
<p>Wild dogs sniff at the remaining fragrances.</p>
<p>Battle traces hang for thousands of years,</p>
<p>Victory song, first chapter.</p>
<p>A memorial tower should be left,</p>
<p>A statue should be sculpted of Lu Yang.</p>
<p>Sofu Group</p>
<p>Rumor has it that Japanese women,</p>
<p>Organized the Sofu Group.</p>
<p>The world sets a precedent,</p>
<p>Peace relies on its creation.</p>
<p>Surely, gentleness will overcome,</p>
<p>Disbelief in the difficulty of strong power.</p>
<p>The night market is on strike together,</p>
<p>Great ambitions should all be cold.</p>
<p>Lament for Stetinius</p>
<p>The Sino-American relationship is close,</p>
<p>Sharing the same hatred, united against the enemy.</p>
<p>One opportunity shows practical assistance,</p>
<p>Three islands raise false alarms.</p>
<p>Lofty ambitions carried to the heavens,</p>
<p>The heroic spirit shines like a star.</p>
<p>A Stetinius Tower should be left,</p>
<p>Tall, surpassing Suzhou City.</p>
<p>Hu Lifu</p>
<p>Lifu is the most outstanding,</p>
<p>Zhabei and the central government.</p>
<p>One can be human and dog,</p>
<p>Actually playing as a tiger's accomplice.</p>
<p>Official names are strangely coupled,</p>
<p>The nation laments there is no match.</p>
<p>Before and after, do not dare to speak more,</p>
<p>Neither spread nor</p>
<p>(Respond with reward)</p>
<p>Feelings Upon the League of Nations Investigation Team Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>China and Japan start a solo fight,</p>
<p>Mediation, salvage the alliance.</p>
<p>The world has justice,</p>
<p>Humanity has no war.</p>
<p>Planning to skin the fierce tiger,</p>
<p>Seeking food, the giant whale.</p>
<p>Ignorance actually so,</p>
<p>Who will cry out for injustice.</p>
<p>Second Poem</p>
<p>The entire city, police, merchants, and students,</p>
<p>Compete to welcome the delegation.</p>
<p>Special ships arrived noisily at the port,</p>
<p>All sectors held banquets in celebration.</p>
<p>All walls were filled with slogans,</p>
<p>No member was without a tall hat.</p>
<p>After the champagne was served,</p>
<p>Foolishly talking about Handan dreams.</p>
<p>Third Poem</p>
<p>Rumor has it that the representatives,</p>
<p>Are all colonial officials.</p>
<p>Aggression is commonplace,</p>
<p>Requesting is truly difficult.</p>
<p>Arranging iron and blood,</p>
<p>Preparing to fight and negotiate.</p>
<p>One battle destroys the strong enemy,</p>
<p>The world watches with bated breath.</p>
<p>Lamenting Shanghai</p>
<p>Ten-mile foreign field,</p>
<p>Always called a paradise.</p>
<p>Mirage sings softly,</p>
<p>Golden house dances gracefully.</p>
<p>Knowing to spit out soaring clouds,</p>
<p>Massage competes to imitate Russia.</p>
<p>For days, beacon fires are urgent,</p>
<p>What is the intention of heaven?</p>
<p>Manure</p>
<p>Manure becomes from rice, manure produces rice,</p>
<p>Officials come from the people, officials afflict the people.</p>
<p>If you compare high officials to manure,</p>
<p>Describing them is still not entirely true.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Electric Fence <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Speaking of electric fences, most people think they are a terrifying thing. In fact, electric fences are not as scary as most people imagine; their efficiency is very low. To know the usefulness of electric fences, 90% is in the fence, and 10% is in the electricity; because breaking the fence is more difficult, but breaking the electricity is very easy.</p>
<p>After the electric fence is energized, the purpose is to cause immediate death when a person touches it, so the voltage used is very high, usually around 3,000 volts (Volt) or more. Because direct current cannot generate such a high voltage, the electricity used in electric fences is alternating current, which is electricity in which the direction of the current changes back and forth within a very short period of time. (Most of the electricity used for electric lights now is this type of electricity.) When no one touches the electric fence, the circuit is not connected. Because the generator used for the electric fence has one end connected to the fence and the other end inserted into the ground, but the fence and the ground are not connected, the circuit cannot be completed. Assuming someone touches the fence, then the circuit between the fence and the ground is connected, and the current flows from the generator to the fence, passes through the human body and into the ground, and then returns from the ground to the generator. The human body loses its life due to the passage of high-voltage current.</p>
<p>The alternating current generator used for the electric fence has a very high voltage, but the current is not very high. Therefore, the coils inside this type of generator cannot withstand the passage of strong currents, otherwise the coils will burn out. Breaking the power supply of the electric fence is to take advantage of this point. The method is very simple: use a metal chain, one end connected to a thick metal rod, insert the rod into the ground, and throw the other end onto the electric fence. Then the circuit between the electric fence and the ground is connected, and the current flows from the fence through the metal chain and rod into the ground. Because the metal chain and rod are much thicker than the wires on the fence, their resistance is also much less than the resistance of the wires on the fence. In other words, for the same conductor, the thicker it is, the easier it is for the current to pass through. Therefore, when electricity passes through the chain and rod, a huge current is generated. This strong current, flowing back to the generator from the ground, will burn out the coils of the generator. So, in this way, not only is the power supply on the electric fence cut off, but the generator is also destroyed. However, ordinary generators are equipped with fuses to prevent the passage of strong currents. These fuses have a certain limit to the maximum amount of current they can pass through. If this limit is exceeded, the fuse will melt due to excessive heat, and the strong current cannot pass through. So, when we use the above method to break the power supply of the electric fence, the generator will not be damaged by us. However, its fuse has been blown by the huge current, so the circuit connected to the generator and the electric fence is broken, and the current cannot flow from the generator to the electric fence. At this time, the electric fence is no different from an ordinary barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War, everyone said that Japan used electric fences. In fact, according to reliable sources, Japan did not use electric fences this time. I have already said above that 90% of the usefulness of electric fences is in the fence, so the usefulness of electricity is extremely low! This is because breaking the electricity is too easy. Most ordinary people, seeing barbed wire fences, say they are electric fences. The Japanese see that the people of our country are ignorant, and also spread a lot of electric fence rumors to chill the hearts of our army; in fact, what they used were just some barbed wire fences. This is all because the intelligence of the people of our country is too immature, so they are often deceived by others!</p>

<h3 id="e147">Saving the Nation with Film <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The other day, this journal published an article on saving the nation with dancing. If dancing can save the nation, I think those who perform as models will unify the world. In fact, of course, that is impossible; it was just a humorous and satirical essay.</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese youth, in addition to being infatuated with dancing, the level of film enthusiasm is probably even higher than dancing. But I think saving the nation with dancing is just talk, while film can really save the nation.</p>
<p>In the eyes of most people, film seems to be nothing more than a tool for entertainment. In fact, film itself has its own great value. It is the crystallization of art, and at the same time, it is also a good tool for cultivating the minds of the public. Film is indeed a good propaganda tool. For example, during this Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai, we can capture the atrocities of the Japanese army and the tragic situation of Zhabei on camera and project them onto the screen, so that the Chinese public can witness these films and have them deeply imprinted in their minds, never forgetting our enemies and thinking of ways to take revenge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the battle achievements of the 19th Route Army, we have captured them in the motion picture camera, not only can we show them to the public, but we can also show them inside the army, so that ordinary Chinese soldiers can break the previously held concept of non-resistance and be able to bravely kill the enemy during times of national crisis. However, in fact, most of the films previously produced by Chinese film companies have mainly aimed to cater to social psychology, such as supernatural, martial arts, love, and other films, which are often enough to intoxicate and corrupt the minds of the audience. These kinds of films are not only insufficient to save the nation, but may even be enough to destroy the nation, and the consequences are very dangerous.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Chinese film industry in the future should quickly realize the responsibility of film, change the previously held concept, and actively promote films containing nationalistic character, so that the general audience can understand the dangerous path of the Chinese nation, and everyone can fight for the nation and strive for the permanent survival of the Chinese nation. Only in this way can the film industry fulfill its responsibilities and complete the mission of saving the nation with film.</p>

A separate date will be scheduled to summon the parties regarding the remaining amount owed. This instruction is hereby given.</p>

<p>3.  One case: Zhu Boshilov's request to transfer management and issue a certificate has been reviewed. A vehicle of the debtor Melli Shequ has been seized and appraised by this court and a public notice for auction has been issued. However, as the period of the public notice has been long and there have been no buyers, the request to have the creditor manage the vehicle themselves and issue a certificate for the remaining amount owed is hereby approved. As there are ten yuan remaining from the twenty yuan of sealing fees previously paid, come to the court at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month to collect it. This instruction is hereby given.</p>

As the request to seize the immovable property of the debtor has now been received, it is hereby approved. A date will be scheduled to notify the relevant officials to designate the area for sealing. This instruction is hereby given.</p>
<p>5.  One case: Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank's renewed request for execution and collection of funds has been reviewed.

This instruction is hereby given.</p>
<p>6.  One case: Wang Jingen et al.'s request to copy the mortgage certificate has been reviewed. After the order has copied the certificate, deliver it immediately.

This instruction is hereby given.</p>
<p>7.  One case: Wang Gongxian's request to take over the management of the seized assets has been reviewed. The movable assets of the debtor Xie Chunsheng were seized and appraised by the court.

A date will be scheduled to send an official to release the sealing and hand over the assets for management. Pay the execution fee of this case that has not been submitted. Be informed. This instruction is hereby given.</p>
<p>Public Notice by Service</p>
