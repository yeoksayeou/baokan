<p>時評</p>
<h3>日俄互不侵犯條約果能成立乎</h3>
<p>梓</p>
<p>沈迷於煙幕中之日俄關係。爲最近國人苦心研索而欲明瞭其眞相者。一般人對於日俄關係所懷之疑問凡三。其一爲日俄究竟能否接近。此觀於二十四日兩國煤油合同之成立。不難窺見一斑。其二爲蘇俄之眞態如何。此觀於二十五日莫斯科傳來之俄當局否認將承認僞國消息。可以稍稍推測之。其三爲日俄互不侵犯條約有無成立之可能。則爲日俄關係基本所在。而與我東北事件有重要之聯繫者。今就本文一討論之。</p>
<p>日俄皆非甘於屈辱退讓之國家。而自東北事件爆發以來。蘇俄棄其在我東三省北部之權利而不顧。一再受屈忍辱。日本於今春以後。亦改其對俄挑　之政策。表示退讓。此其故非由於兩國之不欲戰與不能戰。正各欲籌可以一戰勝敵之策。以此等待機會耳。蓋日本對俄開戰。非一舉而以淸津港之海軍占領海參崴。掩護陸軍急趨海蘭泡。與其由中東路進攻之軍隊相呼應。挫俄軍之銳氣。引起俄國之内亂者。則曠日持久。將不免陷於失敗之運命。反之。蘇俄對日開戰。亦非一面於阿穆爾鐵路東端具充分之戰備。一面於我東省造成可以互爲呼應之實力。一舉而摧毁日軍之主力。則不特須顧慮五年計劃之被犧牲。而後顧多愛。不如不戰。惟此皆非容易成功之企圖。且又各有所牽制。其企圖不能積極進行。於是日方則以退讓免决裂。努力於鞏固在我東省之地位。求免對俄作戰時後方之受影響。俄則以屈辱求暫時之和平。集中實力於赤塔附近。以勤修戰備。在此兩方各無必勝把握。各求暫免接觸之形勢下。互由表面一綫未斷之關係。保持其和平。由此表面之和平關係。以漸相接近以漸就外交方式求兩全之計。最後乃不得不以俄方提出之訂立互不侵犯條約問題。一試兩國有無可以避免戰事之可能性。此近日外電所傳之日俄互不侵犯條約問題不所由成也。</p>
<p>吾人欲斷定日俄間此項互不侵犯條約之能否成立。應先一考察兩國間相對待之根本策劃。此項根本策劃之爲吾人所能知者。在日方爲使謝米諾夫製造西伯利亞白俄國家。以作日俄直接開戰之緩衝。以爲日人在我東省所侵佔之地域作屏蔽。在蘇俄則爲保持和平狀態。以待其五年計劃之成功。以求其主義之向東發展。不受妨碍。使日本之策劃而成功。則蘇俄不特喪失領土。且其主義向東發展之路。横被梗塞。此豈俄方所能忍者。使蘇俄之策劃而得成功。則日本帝國主義。將成爲釜底游魚。此又日本所不能容受者兩國相對待之根本計劃。如此根本衝突。此足以證明其互不侵犯條約之萬不能成立也。</p>
<p>日人通訊社。傳蘇俄提出訂立互不侵犯條約之消息。而謂日本有拒絶之態度。此日本不願放棄其使謝米諾夫製造西伯利亞白俄國家之明證也。蘇俄否認其將承認僞國。此表示煤油合同雖成倘互不侵犯條約未能訂立。兩國對峙之形勢。仍未改變也。於是問題中心。乃集於一問題。即日本能否放棄其根本策劃阻止謝米諾夫在西伯利亞之活動是。倘使日方而欲如其所宣傳。實行融和蘇俄者。非放棄其根本策劃不可。否則對峙形勢之維持。僅足爲俄運輸能力薄弱之補救耳。吾人於此就蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約之提議。見加拉罕輩外交手腕之辛辣。而日俄關係之煙幕。所掩蔽者。即爲此俄外交當局之辛辣手腕。日人之徒勞。乃其必然之後果也。</p>

<p>（一）满洲國已經獨立、無論原因存在與否應以現存事實爲據、解决遼案、故不能同意李頓之提案、（二）满洲國爲淸朝發源地、在前淸治下、純爲封禁地方、不准漢人移住、故不能看做中國原有之領土、（三）满洲國之獨立、出於三千萬人民之自决、又是淸朝回復其原有之領土、於日本無關、各國須尊重民族自决、</p>

<p>華盛頓星報之推測</p>
<p>世界社華盛頓訊、華盛頓星報載巴黎通信員一文、預料國際聯盟壽命行將告終、引起一般之注意、該文略謂國聯現遭一嚴重危機、英法兩國均在研究以另一種包含美國在内之國際組織、爲國聯之代、至此種意見之所以增盛者、有種種理由如下、（一）美俄兩國始終未加入國聯、美國現無　　　形勢、（二）英國已失其從前對國聯之　　、數年來英對國聯之態度頗形消極、　　撥麥唐納似願見國際爭端由關係　間直接談判解决、而不經由國聯之幹旋、（二）德國有退出軍縮大會之表示、倘法國利用國聯、以德違反條約義務爲理由、而加壓迫於德、則德必退出、德退、意國將隨之退出、而匈奥布亦有同退之勢、（四）國聯於一年來對於遠東問題、暴露無力處置之弱態、日本完全置諸不睬、現且亦以退出相恫嚇、（五）對於玻璃維亞·鳥拉圭兩國之爭、國聯亦無辦法、又秘書長德魯蒙爵士之辭職、國聯之經費問題及經費之分配問題、均爲國聯之難關、其中對於聯盟關係最重大與危險者、爲满洲與德國兩問題、日本之進退、視調查團報告書之内容决定之、德國之進退、則視法國之情形如何而定、苟德日意等國脫退聯盟、所殘留者惟英法二大國、然英國態度旣如上述、在如此情形勢之下、恐難延長聯盟之運命、故九月初旬應開之大會、延期至第四週、軍縮會議與對法對德之妥協、亦隨之而延期回答、今日本對於李頓報告書審議、又請延期六週、聯盟内部之裂痕、日益深刻、同時爲謀改造起見、擬歡迎美國另組機關云、</p>
<h3>日陸海軍實力</h3>
<p>自誇可制勝俄美？</p>

<p>二十軍球隊留别上海各界人士書</p>
<p>運動技術幼稚的我們、這次竞大着瞻來到上海、與各界人士及各體育同志們見了面、更承各界特别愛護和獎掖、或語言文字的指導、或珍鮮時　的　勞、或給杯盾旗幟書籍等紀念物、我們受了這種竉榮、是十二萬分的感激、又是十二萬分的慚愧、</p>
<p>我們離川很久了現在已一再奉令催促返川、因此不能與各位作長時間的請益和切磋、因離滬忽忙、更未能一一向各位走辭、這使我們感受非常的不安、我們謹在這裏以誠懇的態度、向各位言别、並誌感謝、</p>
<p>我們於言别誌謝之外、更有幾點意思請求、希望於各位、尤特别希望於各體育同志及新聞界朋友們、</p>
<p>我國體育的幼稚和不發達、是無可諱言的、上海爲我國唯一大埠、文明的策源地、體育一項、自不能例外、我們希望各位以「先知先覺」的資格、更抱定「覺後覺」的熱忱和精神、把全國的體育提倡起來、把全國的體育空氣鼓動起來、</p>
<p>南京這次開了一個全國體育會議、議定許多體育方案、但是要使這些方案期諸實現、恐怕還是要大多數人的督促和帮助、我們首先希望各位將這督促和帮助的責任肩負起來、使政府對各方案的設計、早日施行、全國民衆也早得着運動的機會</p>
<p>世界運動會我國今年算是第一次去簽到了、試更翻開歷屆遠東運動會的紀錄、我國的成績是如何、「往者已矣」、我們應作「收之桑榆」的努力、這種努力自然全國的體育同志們都應該同樣的去做但是體育先進的上海的同志們似應「百尺竿頭更進一步」、將來在下次世界運動會和遠東運動會去競覊權爭榮譽、</p>
<p>四川是僻處西陲、郵航尙便、我們在形勢上似與各位遠隔了、精神聲氣、尙可相通、我們希望各位以後不要以鄙遠見棄、隨時指導我們、並聯合起來同在體育的光明大道上努力、</p>
<p>現在我們就此與各位告别了、敬祝各位健康、再我們這次蒙海上體育同志們的厚愛、有許多團體來約的比賽、我們因時間的短促和精神的疲勞關係、未能遵命、我們是十二萬分的抱歉、除已分别緘復外、我們謹在這裏併申歉意、並請原諒、</p>

<h3>一九三二丨三三年籃球規則更改（一）</h3>
<p>（全國體愶會公佈）</p>
<p>第一章第三條添中線條例、應「十秒鐘規則」之用、全文如下、</p>
<p>塲之中心應劃一半徑三尺長之圓圈、謂之「中圈、」圈内劃一與端線平行之對徑線、將對徑線左右延長至與兩邊綫相交爲止、謂之「中線」線闊二寸、在球場長度之不满六十尺者、此線不適用、</p>
<p>第五章第六條球衣前後各須備有同樣號數、以便易於識别全文更改如下、</p>
<p>每球員應備有同樣號數兩個、縫於背心前後、號數字高至少六寸、以一寸闊之物料製成、同隊球員不得用同樣號數、</p>
<p>第七號第三條去年曾添關係爭球之註一條、現因後塲十秒鐘限制之規定、故將此註取消、但遇球員在後塲内之被對方監守不能有所舉動、爲時過五秒鐘者、裁判員或檢查員仍可宣告爭球、惟因旣有十秒鐘規則之限制故此等情形、在事實上已不易發見、</p>
<p>第七章第十二條「障礙」之定義、有重要更改、條後新漆一註、原名障礙應改名「擋礙」、全文如下、</p>
<p>用身體接觸阻擋非持球之對手進行、謂之「擋礙」</p>
<p>（註）擋礙旣屬侵人犯規、故意義上已無「合例障礙」動作之可言、</p>
<p>合法防止對手侵人之動作、應謂之「看守」Ｓcreening」</p>
<p>第七章第十三條新增「對面防衛」之定義如下球員不顧球之方向、面對而跟隨對方球員之移動、而阻礙其進行者、謂之「對面防衛、」</p>
<p>第七章第十四條將舊規則之第十三十四十五三條、合併爲一、全文如下、</p>
<p>違犯規則謂之「犯規」犯規者應受一次或一次以上之罰球、技術犯規及侵人犯規之種類、分别舉述於十五章甲乙兩項、</p>
<p>第七章第二十二條解釋前塲及後塲之定義如下、</p>
<p>球隊本籃所在之半塲地爲該隊之前塲、其他塲爲後塲、</p>
<p>第八章第八條規規則更改之最重要處因新式打法之影響、每使比賽進行動作之速度上、漸形减遲故特定此條之限制、以冀恢復比賽原有之速度及精神、全文如下、</p>
<p>（甲）某球隊在其後塲獲球後、如該球未經觸及對方球員、或被觸及者、則該隊應於十秒鐘内將球傳過中線、如一經觸反對方球員或被觸及後、而球仍在後塲内時、則十秒鐘規則、又行開始、</p>
<p>某隊已將球傳至前塲後、除下列四例外、不得將球退回後塲、（一）投過籃者、（二）經過中圈或他處跳球者、（三）已經出界者、（四）球曾被對方奪去、而再行獲得者、</p>
<p>（乙）球隊之照上述四例情形在前塲獲球後、該球只准退回中綫一次、</p>
<h3>籃球新術（二）（不許轉載）</h3>
<p>白爾凱Ｃlaire　Ｂurcky原著</p>
<p>張國勳　錢一勤　合譯</p>
<p>籃球游戲、曾於某一時期爲困籠式者、其場之四周圍以繩索之網尋常多有四面牆壁、最初以七人爲一隊、隨後改爲九人、更又改成八人、及今下塲者乃易爲五人、比賽時間、亦由每局分三個時間、改爲兩個半時矣、</p>
<p>塲地之大小、向無標凖之規定、大槪爲兒童者寛四十呎、今中學生之球塲則爲寛四十八呎、長七十五呎、至合規之球塲、最大者、不得過五十呎寛九十八呎長最小者、亦不得小於三十五呎寛六十呎長</p>
<p>於技術名稱上　塲之兩邊較長之邊界爲邊線、短者爲底線、全局比賽須行之於此界内、至此賽之目的、當然使球於對區内之本籃中、多多穿過耳、（更正）本文昨載之末第三句、有數字差誤茲校正如下、「雖此游戲經四十一年來之多方變更」、</p>

<p>離滬情形　昨日上午十時許、宋氏即整裝待發、同時相約同行之張學良顧問端納·代表李雲超、亦於斯時同蒞宋宅、至十時半、宋氏遂與端納及夫人張樂怡女士等、乘車至虹橋飛機塲、於十時五十五分、乘自備塞柯斯飛機出發返京、宋夫人張樂怡、僅送登飛機即返、此外送行者、有中央研究院副院長楊杏佛毛邦初等、</p>
<p>宋氏談話　記者昨晨晤宋氏於其寓次、據宋氏談稱、余（宋氏自稱）本日先返京、在京約留二三日、再赴廬山、至今日報載、余下令下月停付日庚欵一節、完全不確、蓋日本雖一再咄咄逼人、不顧國際信義、而我國須再忍耐、以保持我之對於日本、仍爲一張白紙、無一點可以使日有所藉口、同時使日之囂張跋扈、益昭彰於世界云云、</p>
<p>將赴北平　宋等此行之任、務聞係關於内政問題、到京之後、除向中央報告赴杭經過外、并將偕何應欽等、同赴廬山、出席會議、宋等俟在廬山與蔣中正晤商後、尙擬偕端納李雲超等赴北平一行、俾與張學良等作一度之晤談云、</p>

<h3>僞組織出爾反爾</h3>
<p>國輪仍可通航</p>
<p>九月二十五日、僞組織開徵船鈔關稅以後、上海中外各國商輪、初以未有訂約、恐不能航行東北各埠、國輪方面、更謀另開航路、以維營業、詎電訊傳來、僞國仍許中外商船行駛東北、亟將此事情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>託辭開放　僞國又擅定有約無約國名目、東北之安東·營口·大連·各埠、在九月二十五日以後、無約國輪、不能行駛、但又慮一旦實行禁駛、勢必妨礙其稅收、遂經一般漢奸議定、託辭開放門户、無約國商輪、仍可照常開行、不受任何條約束縛、依然可自由進出各港、</p>
<p>徵收噸鈔　二十六日起、赴東北輪船、須納噸鈔、按我國海關徵收噸鈔、照註册噸位、每季每噸、收銀三錢、付噸鈔後、可通行全國各埠、而以三個月爲期、今僞國則取自由航行辦法、噸鈔徵取、以每次計算、規定在五千噸以内輪船、開往東北一趟、納費四十元左右、如下次開往、又須再付噸鈔、該項辦法、已通知各輪公司矣、</p>
<p>利用華輪　東北産生大荳·雜糧·及油等項、向以内地中部南部各地銷路最暢、一旦禁止中外輪船行駛、則該項大荳荳餅雜糧及油、若全有日船裝載、則當此抵制激烈時、勢必到處拒卸、將使批輸出貨、根本困滯、無法運出僞國當局、遂利用華輪代爲裝載、故於政記·肇興·毓大·海昌·大通·等各公司輪、仍令照舊航運、但課鈔稅耳、</p>
<p>國輪赴營　中國各輪局、得到營口來電、可以開行、本埠海昌公司海順輪、定今日由滬開往東北、惟所載出口貨、運赴營口者、統照新章繳全稅、該輪爲中國商船中由滬開往東北之第一艘云、其他政記肇興毓大等公司、亦各在派班中矣、</p>

<h3>上海公共租界水費激增備忘錄</h3>
<p>民國二十一年九月十三日</p>
<p>上海公共租界自來水費、自經英商上海自來水有限公司、經工部局核准、普用水表後、其已被裝表者激增甚鉅、甚有比用房租爲標準計算之數增加九倍者、茲列數例如下、</p>
<p>當房租百　　　　　　　水表計</p>
<p>付水費者　　分七·五水費　　　　　算水費　　　　增加倍數</p>
<p>寗波同鄉會　三四·七五　　　　　　七九·三八　　一倍以上</p>
<p>益記經租賬房二八·五○　　　　　　二三○·五七　八倍以上</p>
<p>長泰公司　　二四·四六　　　　　　二一·九五○　九倍弱</p>
<p>顧蘭記　　　六五·八三（二十天）　二三八·六三　五倍以上</p>
<p>又　　　　　三五·○九（二十六天）一三四·○○　四倍以上</p>
<p>華達洋行　　四三·○一（三十四天）三四四·二五　七倍半</p>
<p>又　　　　一四一·○○（二十天）　四○九·一九　四倍以上</p>
<p>又（須查其五　　　（一個月二天）　三二○·二五</p>
<p>十七幢租金）</p>

<p>標粉晨疲午回</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平疲之象以洋麥報價、雖互有上落、惟洋麥來華空氣依然不佳、兼之時局不佳、買户稀少、各盤開價、異常暗淡較前日收價、計小去五厘不等、迨至下午開盤初仍不振、旋因某大户放價收買、數量雖未甚暢、市氣則爲之帶起、惟臯豐隨市抛出、數量相等、故此種一度奮興、此步仍難維持也、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、十月份好二厘半、十一月份好七厘半、十二月份好五厘、一月份好五厘、二月份好二厘半云、</p>
<p>期麥進出沉寂</p>
<p>昨期麥市面上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盛旋之象、以洋麥報價、出入甚　、各月份之買賣、又轉停寂查目下市場之籌碼、實在不多無論買賣之任何一方、卽有大批交易亦不能盡　進出實因客户稀少、遂呈自然不振之象也結果十月份較前日小二分十一月份不動、十二月份至二月份各小一分、現麥市面、尙趨平穩開　　麥三兩五錢四分固鎭麥三兩五錢二分、鎭江麥三兩四錢八分、高郵麥三兩四錢七分、共開二十三面包云</p>

<p>新秋繭絲本不廉</p>
<p>繅絲一百斤凈繭本須扯六百兩</p>
<p>今歲江浙兩屬秋繭收成不豐、入夏後天氣亢旱、桑株枯萎葉價較昂、農民　本不廉、新繭上市後、絲繭商因放價競收優繭、致鮮繭價統扯須四十五六元、現卜秋乾繭分批渾滬各絲廠均開绍繅製據廠絲商某君稱、今歲秋繭絲本仍高、平均繅絲一百斤凈、繭本須扯六百兩左右、外加繅工按照目下洋莊絲價、廠方抛售每包須虧本銀七八十兩云</p>
<p>洋莊茶市日趨沉靜</p>

<h3>油市</h3>
<p>柏油銷淸價廉</p>
<p>柏油銷塲在秋令本以製燭爲主體、乃今庚値滬戰之後、秋銷大减、推其原因實係民生凋弊、往年所謂香汛已無形消滅皂廠用度、旣告落令、而燭淘銷路、又甚淸淡、各處存底雖屬不厚、然市塲上之岑寂、爲歷年所未有、人心不免慌張、杭州方面先行跌價而漢口繼之、漢市麻城油由十七兩八錢、一跌再跌、現已至十四兩四錢矣、惟麻城前者加至十七兩八錢之時、本屬漲之太過、蓋其時重殂荆州油、亦祇十七兩稍零、今者麻城之跌、亦不由程序、故重荆仍在十六兩之間、以貨品而論、前係太過、現得其平、愈進連退、皆無正軌可循、不若荆油之徐進緩退爲正當也、據連日漢函所詳、存底約計二三千件左右、以往年中秋前後而衡、尙嫌單薄、但今秋銷塲特别淸淡、且山頭年令報豐、將來子價可有廉望因是對於陳油、不行早爲之謀、惟是求售愈急、人心愈慌、市面愈疲、本埠行家存貨本尠、惟聞尙有客貨未有開出、其數不多、祇因値江河日下之時行家不免望而却步耳、所幸　新貨尙有兩月、現雖銷淸而致成一蹶不振之勢、然存貨究薄、待到靑黃不接之際、另起變化、未可料也、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>純銻驟漲十餘兩</p>
<p>湖南純銻、近因來貨不多各帮採辦甚旺、兼之洋莊生意、亦蓬勃而興、因此市貨遂有靑黃不接之象、標準因之驟加十一兩半、刻每噸要估二百二十五兩五錢、如若零估則每噸非二百三十二三兩不等、據一般熟悉此貨内幕者云、近來廠方出品不廣、（蓋受共匪之影響）本埠人心良佳是以行情一節恐有漲而無跌、</p>
<p>靑鉛抛出七八百條</p>
<p>靑鉛交易自漲後頗覺冷落、惟人心甚硬、所以行情一節、尙能堅挺昨黃丹廠及油漆公司等錢、七厘半五兩、比前均各好一錢半、而二厘半一分等花色亦各有漲價之訊、交易方面因此反旺、雖昨逢星期日、雖星期亦達四五百担之多、購户多係客帮云、</p>
<p>英鋼板市面回頭</p>
<p>英鋼板昨行情已見轉機、如五厘半開五兩三均有成交聞開出有七八百條之多、行情每担爲十二兩一錢半、係月底交淸之期貨云、</p>
<p>秋皮釘津銷尙廣</p>
<p>秋皮釘昨日天津帮辦去共有一百餘箱之多、行情雖一時不見增加、然市勢比之前市已覺好起多多矣其開出價如三分每箱爲二十一兩四分五分二十兩零五錢、六分二十兩云、</p>

<h3>對外的禮物</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>戰影只竉罩在東面的省分，蹂躪一年的東三省，不必說了；接着，便有廣東案件，最近，又有山東案件：本來我國的省分東三省以外，只有廣東山東在名稱上都含有一個東子；雄糾糾的武夫，不能到關外的東三省去參加作戰，便在關内含着東字的省分，先來練習一下子；這是他們紀念着東方之　，不是不愛國啊。</p>
<p>一般的與論，都說；我國軍人的槍口是向内的，專把槍彈當做對内的禮物；現在山東韓劉交鋒，又踏着對内作戰的覆轍了。我說他們不是對内，都是對外；這次交鋒，便是他們預備着一種對外的禮物。</p>
<p>爲着侵略中土的外國人，常常無中生有的誣蔑我國。他們體諒着外國人無中生有的太費心思，趕緊奉獻一種對外的禮物。爲着偏袒某方的外國人，意在搜尋我國最大的弱點，做那偏袒的相當材料。他們體諒外國人時搜尋不到相當的材料，趕緊奉獻一種對外的禮物。</p>
<p>禮物是会什麽？當然不是槍彈了；只是一種應時適用的對外禮物，丨一個大大的話柄。</p>
<h3>談什麽煙禁</h3>
<p>— 焯元</p>
<p>丨一片烏烟瘴氣丨</p>
<p>道光十六年，鴉片入口已達二萬八千零十一箱，祇廣東一省，在道光十四年至十六年輸出銀元已達三千餘萬兩。利權外溢，眞是可驚。所以林則徐先生說：「此禍不除十，年後無可用之兵，無可籌之餉。」因而奉請禁絶。不幸後來和英國一仗打下來，不但賠兵費割香港，並且五口通商外國，雅片反而在中國大賣特賣。</p>
<p>本來，要抵制外貨祇有提倡國貨，救國之士，有見及此，所以不到幾年，全國雅片出産很多，挽回利權當然也不少。有的地方並且勒令棄稻植烟，因爲利息比比稻麥大多少倍，出産多，政府可多得稅收，國何愁不富，軍隊保愁無餉，且國人全抽上雅片，才可一致抖擻精神，興奮起來，憑手榴彈似的烟槍，個把帝國主義眞算不了什麽。</p>
<p>官不抽烟，没有官氣，兵不抽烟，没有兵氣，民不抽烟，没有民氣，上上下下萎靡不振，全是不抽烟的緣故。多抽烟，少吃飯，何况這還是救災的一辦法呢？</p>
<p>通盤籌劃，没有禁烟的理由，倘不幸千萬年後眞禁絶了，我敢把林則徐生生的話改過來；「此禍一除，馬上無可用之兵，無可籌之餉。」</p>
<h3>三等電車</h3>

<p>汽，車根本這是一種空想，自備包車，那說得上，就是頭等電車，都没有這多的錢，來花，來閙，來神奇眞是，朋友，事情很難，談何容易，在上海首先就要知道無錢的苦處，即使你有意，即使你高興，這實際，能夠嗎？說句老實話，還是三等電車好。</p>
<p>座位，這是特别的座位，這是稀奇的一切呢，也可以說等於没有，人與人，物與物，把一團散沙似的國民拈在一起，如漆如膠，如火如荼，說個比喻吧，好像一盒沙丁魚。</p>
<p>一會兒，好像上了山，一會兒，好像下了坡，一會兒又好像潮水似的，湧來湧去，交關有趣，要不然，各色各樣的怪樣子，愈令人夠味？</p>
<p>江北女人的小脚廣東阿妹的辫子，上工工女的提藍，下等娼妓的臀部，不但應有，而且盡有，有時，口沬與涎痰交飛，有時，臭味與汗氣齊來，如此天堂，佛曰：善哉善哉！</p>

<h3>美的神秘</h3>
<p>— 徐澆花</p>
<p>丨各個婦女眼中的美丨</p>
<p>美是什麽？它是具有神秘的藝術，推着時代的輪，把着潮流的舵，因各個婦女環境和旨趣的不同，而成各個的對象。現將社會上一般婦女愛美的心理，分析來說：</p>
<p>（一）摩登小姐所認做美的，是兜風的摩托汽車，每日一換的時髦裝束，金鋼鑽戒，白金錶鐲，吃大菜，會跳舞。</p>
<p>（二）闊老的姨太太所認做美的，是：紅得不可開交的戲子，健壯的汽車夫阿二，　子老爺的大把鈔票，八圈又八圈的麻雀，一付精緻的鴉片烟具。</p>
<p>（三）女學生所認做美的，是：雙雙的情侶，甜蜜的情書，愛人的照片，定情的紀念品，性的小說書籍，看影戲，逛公園。</p>
<p>（四）舊式女子所認做美的，是：令出必遵的男人，嬌啼憨笑的小官，簇新的旗袍，趨時的剪髮，畫日沉迷的賭博，白相大世界，看髦兒戲，手上的赤金戒，嘴裏的金　　。</p>

<p>（十三）</p>
<p>他們都是走得很快，不到十分鐘的時間，已走到了伊們的家裏。大門是開着，靜悄悄地一無聲息，堂屋娶正中，還安放着刺繡用的绷架，但是架上已没有繡件，剪刀與繡花的針，還在桌子上面。</p>
<p>「余太太！余太太！」袁團長一進門便喊芬若，但是並没有芬若的應聲，而樓上走下來的是放繡貨的王先生。</p>
<p>「啊呀！」王先生見了縣長，公安局長，警察，還有袁團長手裏抱着頭破血淋的袁瘋婦，大吃一驚，從半樓梯踏了空，也跌了下來。</p>
<p>「余太太呢？」在王先生從地上爬起來的時候，袁團長又問「咳！伊死了。」</p>
<p>「怎麽？伊剛才還好好的，怎麽會死？」</p>
<p>這時張醫生也下樓來了，他和公安局長是很熟識的，便報告道「我本就要來報局了，這女人是用手槍自殺，已無法救治的了。」</p>
<p>「你怎麽知道伊自殺而跑來診救？」公安局長鐵靑了臉，開始執行他的職務。</p>
<p>「我在會塲參加這位袁團長紀念碑典禮，恰巧這兩天，我兒子也很疲憊，所以很抱歉，不」</p>
<p>等到散會，便先回家中；而這位放繡貨的王先生，跑來告訴我說，余芬若開槍自殺，我便帶了一些相當的醫療用品，和他奔來救治，但是伊是用槍自己擊在太陽穴裏，槍子從左面進，右面穿出，出血過多，腦子已破，所以没有希望了。」張醫生據實報告。</p>
<p>「那麽你怎麽知道伊自殺呢？」公安局長又向王先生嚴問。</p>
<p>「這位先生剛才是在這裏」，王先生指着袁團長說，「我恰巧代伊買了西瓜送來，我說了幾句話便是，臨走的時候，我還勸這位先生快快到會呢。當時余芬若曾託我找張醫生來，給這個瘋婦打針，所以我也曾到會塲上去找過，並没有找到；便走到這裏來想看着瘋子是怎麽樣了。這時余芬若忽然告訴我說伊上樓下刺繡，不曾防備瘋子在樓窗上用一條長帶吊了下去逃跑了，還請我去找尋，一壁又取出一個紙包，託我送到會塲上去，交給袁團長。我聽了後急伊生怕瘋子也跑到會塲上去闖禍，急忙取了紙包便走。余芬若送我出門，還是好好的，但是，並没關門。當時我並没注意到，誰知我走了幾十步，忽然聽得伊樓上有了槍聲，忙又趕回來，伊並不在樓下，我又上樓，才見伊躺在床上，左手還執着手槍，方始知道伊是自殺了，我急得没有主意，所以奔到張醫生家裏，請他來救治，咳！可憐啊！伊是不會再活的了。」袁團長聽着，面色漸漸地泛成白色，一句話也不講，抱了妻子便奔上樓去；把妻子安放在另外一張床上，便去撫視芬若，眼淚簌簌地掉下。</p>

<h3>假使你做菩薩</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>自九一八事變後，我國磕頭禮拜，處處乞憐於國際菩薩，天然菩薩以慈悲爲懷，救苦救難，原是菩薩的天職，但雖佛法無邊，終是鏡花水，月曇花一現，泡影誰留，一般苦海衆生不免怨懟起來，大家說菩薩不靈撞煞大當，　　但是菩薩雖是金碧輝煌，到底是裝成的一個幌子，並無眞實的力量，所以我國迭次乞憐於國聯菩薩，而國聯一方面用敷延手段，如派員到東北調查事變等等，而一方面須從日本之要求，緩期討論報告書等等，可知有求必應之國聯西洋鏡，早爲東洋人所拆盡，菩薩到此亦必自認爲不靈，</p>
<p>要知菩薩之中，意見亦不一致，有左派的菩薩，有右派的菩薩，并且菩薩的力量，祇能在冥冥之中，加以指示，若自己冥頑不靈，毫無知覺，而專靠菩薩來帮忙，天下萬無是理，故欲菩薩普渡衆生，必須衆生自渡，欲求菩薩救苦救難，衆生必先自救，若自己不救，自己不渡，而專靠菩薩，雖有仙槎寳筏，恐亦無法救治矣，</p>
<p>自已不肯犧牲，而第望他人去犧牲，自己不肯去爭扎，而但望他人去爭扎，此雖子女不能得於父母，而欲以苦海衆生，得之於國際菩薩，世外不曾有此好菩薩也，自己不先衝入戰團，而反想坐在靑龍頭上，看他人之相殺，如此情形，而欲乞憐於菩薩，菩薩必笑而應之曰，假使你做菩薩怎樣，</p>

<h3>火柴的製法</h3>
<p>— 知止</p>
<p>在二十世紀的今日，每個人對於火柴的需要，雖不免受了使用「電」的影響，而没有往日的那樣急切，可是實際上，吾人在日常生活裏，需用的時候仍是很多，所以牠還不失其爲吾人日常的必需品呢，</p>
<p>曾記得在本年四月間，本刊上看見過一篇丁照君「火柴的製法」的大作，内容所說的，雖是非常簡明而淸晰，不過吾覺得這篇對於原題上，似乎未免有些「空虚」和「膚淺」，吾現在偶然的憶起半年前的往事，於是吾就也不揣譾陋的把吾所知道的寫在下面，這或許是可以補充丁君所述的不足於萬一，（原文大約在四月初六日，讀者可參閱）</p>
<p>火柴的種類，大别之可分黃燐火柴，赤燐火柴和無燐火柴等三種，製造時分藥劑和木軸兩部，木軸的形式，有三角軸，圓軸，平軸，粗軸，細軸，長軸短軸，等不同；木軸的村料，又可用白楊，榕樹，赤松，蝦夷松，榀樹，菩提樹，樅松，橧等幾種，内以白楊爲最佳；藥劑又可分爲發火劑，導火劑，可燃性材料，摩擦劑，粘結劑，着色劑等六種，其重要的藥品，爲燐，氣酸鉀，氣化鐵，烟煤，石臘，玻璃粉末，砂，氧化銻，硫磺，二氧化錳，一縮二鉻酸鉀，硅酸銅，松脂，膠，硫化鐵，鐵砂，赭石，粘土等數種，其調合的數量和種類，則隨各種火柴的性質而定，茲就上述三種火柴的製法，擇要述之如下，</p>
<p>（一）黃燐火柴丨黃燐火柴一名磨擦火柴（Ｆriction　Ｍatches）一八三三年爲奥人潑拉區爾Ｐreschel所發明，其配製成分爲黃燐二·五瓩長砂。·一瓩三氧化鐵。·五瓩玻璃粉二瓩膠二瓩水四·五竔，製法極簡單，祇須把這六種原　混合在一只溫熱的鍋子裏，用手或他物揑成泥狀，而後用軸揷入，使其附着，乾後塗少許假漆就得了，這種火柴在任何砂紙上，或是木石上磨擦，就會生起火來，所以非常的危險，並且黃燐中有毒，製造時一般工人很易中毒，職是之故，一九○六年柏林會議曾决議禁止販買此種火柴，到現在，實際上也没有一國再用這種火柴了，</p>
<p>（二）赤燐火柴丨赤燐火柴又名安全火柴（Ｓafety　Matches）一八五五年爲瑞典人侖斯却隆Ｌands　Ｔran所發明，其配製成分可分導火劑與發火劑兩種，導火劑爲氧酸鉀一八瓩一縮二鉻酸鉀一·六瓩硫</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>磺。四瓩二氣化錳一·八瓩三氧化錳一瓩松脂精一瓩玻璃粉二瓩膠一瓩亞刺伯樹膠四·發火藥爲赤燐一瓩硫化鐵。·二五瓩油烟。·五瓩糊糊。·三瓩，這種的火柴，軸頭的藥劑爲導火劑，必須要擦在塗有發火劑的紙面上才能生火，所以危險的程度比黃燐火柴小，並且赤燐是無毒的，决没有中毒的殃禍，所以現世各國所用的火柴，大都屬於這一類，</p>
<p>（三）無燐火柴丨這種火柴和以上兩種，完全不同，因爲牠製造時旣不用燐，但是可在任何的處所磨擦，就能生火，牠的標準的成分是這樣的；氣酸鉀四○分一硫精酸銅一○分一硫硫酸銅六分硫化錏三分硫酸石灰三分硫磺四分玻璃粉末九分膠·（百分之一○之溶液，即膠十克溶於水一百克中之物）二六分混合而成，據說此種火柴，現時德法等國已有特種法律保護獎勵了，可是製法上，還没有達到完全成功的一日哩！</p>

<h3>廢除星期六午後休息之我見</h3>
<p>— 呆影</p>
<p>關於星期存廢問題，本刊已迭有文字發表，詳加討論，我以爲星期日之休息，已成習慣，而我人工作六日，理應有一日之休息，否則長日工作，腦力易於疲乏，精神難以恢復，加之我人服務社會者平日一無餘晷，端頼星期一日，出外訪友，或作其他酬酢，是星期之不可廢除，在事實上，在情理上，均明而且顯者也。</p>
<p>但除星期而外，滬上風習，凡公司，洋行，學校，機關，每於星期六下午，亦實行休息，而我則以爲星期雖不可廢，而星期六下午休息之習慣實有不可不廢除之必要。蓋星期六之下一日，即爲星期，有全日之休息，則星期六午後，又何必要休息半天。</p>
<p>星期六下午休息之緣起，據一般傳說，原始因西人於星期日均須至禮拜堂祈禱，無暇酬酢訪客，因而星期六有半日的休息，所以後來外國人到中國來經商，所設的公司洋行，星期六的下午，都是休息的。至於外人設立的敎會學校，也因星期日要强迫學生去做禮拜，而在星期六的下午，有半天的休息。</p>
<p>但事實上，外國人敎徒占居多數，而中國人入敎的很少，論理外國人設的公司洋行，星期六下午，儘可讓他們休息，而我們中國人，可不必去仿效他們。那知通商而後，國人惟西人之馬首是瞻，看見他們星期六下午休息，所有的機關，規模較大的字號，以及華人所設的非敎會學校，星期六的午後，也都有休息半天的風習了。其實外國人如果爲星期日要祈禱，而星期六休息半天，那麽中國人入敎的很少，何必去學他們呢？　　如果說星期六下午的休息，爲恢復人體工作時所受的疲勞起見，那麽上面早已說過，下一天星期，全日休息，又何必加上半天呢？所以星期六午後的休息，實在是無謂已極，即使在一星期内，要加半天的休息，亦應定在星期三，或星期四的午後，這樣齊巧在一星期之中，不致在一起休息，比較自然適當些。</p>
<p>中國，在現在的情狀之下，工商界在狂呼着增加生産救國，敎育界在呐喊着普及敎育救國，增加生産，普及敎育，的確可以救國，但要求生産增加須多做工作，要普及敎育，學生非多讀些書不可。在工商界·在敎育界·光陰是如何的可貴！所謂寸金難買寸光陰·又那裏可虚費呢？所以星期六的下午，休息半天的風習，立應廢除，尤其是在中國，是一件極明顯的事情。</p>
<p>進一步講，星期六午後的休息，非但無謂，而且有害。一般的人們，因爲星期六午後的休息，在家裏没有事做，也許要出去看電影，逛游戲塲，甚至去嫖娼，賭博等，做些墮落的事情，結果，傷害身體，耗費金錢，爲害不淺。這樣看來，星期六的下午，更見是不應休息呢？</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>飯堂速寫</h3>
<p>— 允良</p>
<p>滬南Ｓ中學，是全市中等學校之冠，學生總數有一千五六百人，每天在ＳＣ路上，絡繹不絶的來來往往，住讀的差不多有五百餘人，狹小的飯堂有人满之患，所以不得不分二次吃，每次三十餘桌，每桌八人，一天三餐，很是熱閙·</p>
<p>「鐺∶∶∶鐺∶∶∶」上午第三課散課鐘很響亮的打過了，一陣沉重的脚聲，從敎室外走廊邊慢慢的向膳廳傳來，不到三分鐘的時候，寂寞的飯堂，湧進狂潮般的人羣，衝破了沉悶的空氣，雷聲似的脚聲，不斷地冲進耳鼓，横衝直撞的闖進來，走到每人自已應該坐的地方，便一屁股的坐了下來、</p>
<p>「釘打···釘打···的敲碗聲，密佈着飯堂的四周，彷彿是打着戰鼓，膳廳彷彿是戰塲，形勢很是嚴重，若然不是校役替學生們一桌桌的盛飯，也許不會停止這可怕的聲浪」</p>
<p>豐盛的菜　四盆二碗二素四葷，雪白的飯粒，那時已成了對敵行爲全堂的學生，個個是精神活潑：眼睛像閃電，牙齒像夾剪，筷頭像雨點，喉嚨像竹管，手臂像槍銃：實彈了的槍銃，描準了敵人·丨飯粒，開始襲擊，喉嚨裏燃燒着飢餓的火餤，長大的紅舌，把粒粒飯珠，當作俘虜一般送進司令部，丨飯議：丨牙兵舌將，奉着上峯命令，把俘虜全數執行嚼刑，有時也會把受創殘廢的將士，慈悲的開着方便之門逐出屠塲，然而倒底是少數呢！</p>
<p>十分鐘狼吞虎嚥的混戰，造成了可怕的殘；跡全檯狼藉的飯粒骨塊，菜瓣殼屑，靑紅紫綠，反映出觸目驚心的五光十色，</p>
<p>最後，一面全軍蘒没，學生唱着凱旋歌向着宿舍走去，</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論</p>
<h3>國聯注意世界汽車事業衰落</h3>
<p>虞</p>
<p>令專家研究復興辦法</p>
<p>近全世界之汽車製造業。雖浸浸乎日有向上之勢。然夷考其實。則去前兩年大有不景氣象。即素以汽車製造業雄視全球之美國。亦大爲衰落。一九二九年時全世界全部産景號稱六百萬輛。及至一九三零年一落千丈。由六百萬輛降而爲四百萬輛。兩兩相較。竟跌去百分之三四·六。殊屬出人意料之外也。其他如歐洲之汽車製造國家意大利·德意志·法蘭西·英吉利等亦莫不盡然。推原其故。一言以蔽之。曰全世界經濟之衰落而已。夫汽車事業旣爲世人所屬目之一種偉大企業。其盛衰消長。自爲國際經濟界所注意。國際聯盟經濟委員組有見及此。最近乃召集專家若干人。專門研究各國汽車之出産及其貿易。自發軔以至完畢爲時亘數月之久。此項報告製就後。即有若干之重要問題隨之而起。當由國聯發交永久之國際摩托製造入局。加以探討研究。所有上述之各專家咸爲此局之會員焉。</p>
<p>近年來世界汽車事業之衰落。及其遭遇之蹭蹬。實爲不可掩刷之事實。一九二九年時全世界各國所造産之汽車及運貨拽拖車等。總數爲六百萬輛。及至翌年一九三零年。忽然跌去百分之三十四又六·其産額祇及四百萬輛。在此時期中美國之跌落數目更爲可觀。竟達百分之三十七又六之鉅。惟此數亦包括坎拿大而言。歐洲各國計法蘭西跌去百分之十。德意志跌去百分之二十六又八。意大利跌去百分之二十。去年即一九三一年世界之汽車産量仍未見有起色。其總數若與一九三零年較又跌去百分之二十五。美國與坎拿大减少百分之三十。歐洲各國所跌之數計法蘭西減少百分二十一又三。德意志减低百分之一九。意大利少去百分之三十七又五。其中以英國之數爲最少。一九三零年時所縮祇及百分之一。至一九三一年則加增爲百分之四又三。上述之數目監視之似已爲不少。但實際上尙因支持得法。始有如是之成績。不然者所跌當更鉅也。</p>
<p>據美國國民汽車商會所發表之統計。自美合衆國所出口之汽車。一九三一年較一九三零年少去百分之四十四。此種現象在製造汽車之諸國中。除德意志而外。殆無不咸然。德國於一九二九至一九三零年間。其出口之汽車約佔全數百分之六。及至一九三一年乃一躍而昇至百分之十四又七。但其價値上之上昇則遠不及數量之上昇。其緣故爲售價之低落及小汽車之盛行。蓋小汽車之視一九三零年所出口之行旅車。其價値祇及百分之五十已也。</p>
<p>又據美國統計。一九三一年時全世界所運用之汽車。其數爲三五、七○○·○○○輛。但是年全世界百分之五十之國家。均感受運輸方面之減低。其中又以下列諸國爲最甚。計美合衆國五五八·八○○輛。阿眞廷四二·○○輛。加拿大二六·八○○輛。故預料一九三二年之出産及銷售數。除英國外。其减少之數當達百分之四十之譜。若英國則於本年開首之數個月中。殊有活躍之氣象也。</p>
<p>至於汽車事業之所以衰落者。其原由不外乎經濟之衰落而受極大之影響。此種情形幾於各國皆然。汽車事業所受經濟衰落之直接影響乃爲羣衆購買力之薄弱而購買力之薄弱又受舊車及低力車之暢銷。至於實業上用之汽車。則其産銷狀况尙能兩相持平。又據各國之報告。各國政府對於使用汽車者常課以額外之稅金。馴至情形愈爲嚴重。而各鐵道會社之利用種種方法與汽車相競爭。又殊令汽車事業之受有打擊也。各專家經此次研究探討之後。僉謂如欲對於汽車事業之衰落加以挽救方法。惟有着目於課稅及關稅保護等之最要問題。若輩又建議國聯邀請永久國際局作專門之學術上的探討以求澈底之解决方法。故渠等又表示將令經濟委員組常得此項研究之進行上的報告也。</p>

<h3>記英製福特車</h3>
<p>— 夏塘</p>
<p>有具八匹馬力</p>
<p>「摩托」評論載稱。在倫敦亞爾勃脫廳所展覽八匹馬力福特之汽車。其吸引公衆趣味之甚。爲前此各種汽車所不及。此次新車問世。曾經多種革新。故目下英製之達勒哈式新車。其與前次由美廠直接運往者。製造方式及式樣外觀。大相逕庭。向來在美廠製造者。頗有數點可資訾議。即以車身一項而論。以較不列顚造之汽車。其車厢空隙殊屬狹。隘引擎方面亦不無難於措置自如之處。凡茲數種短處。均爲造車家所亟思改良者。而今日出世之八缸福特已改善盡美成爲」出色當行之小型汽車。其爲人所不满之處幾於難於指論也。</p>
<p>新車之第一能令人注意及之者。即爲大加改進之式樣。原有之車雖有多處引人入勝。然其短粗之譏誠所難免。自經此次澈底改革後。以前短處一掃而盡。而其動人之綫流乃能流露無遺。車後部之式樣亦經全部改善。一金屬之圍帷將後油櫃維護在内。與後翼尖端成同樣角度。此帷驟視之似與全體不相聯貫。然實際上則與翼之内緣彌相接近。故殊匀調。</p>
<p>護泥板亦經大爲改革。效用確切。前翼與從前之作直形者不同。今則已後瀉與後翼互爲調濟矣。前翼又帶曲綫形。除有效之護泥作用外。更能令全車式樣外觀爲之調濟而增加美觀。後車身之金屬帷及油櫃亦相配得宜。大增觀瞻。全車裝置包括燃燈五盞。風屏上裝有電掃。機扭盤殊爲簡單。上有燃料量表路程碼表。燃燈及開車啟閉機。車之彈簧自首至尾作横切式。車輪及胎具無不精美。除精緻之車輪外。其輪輻係用電銲者。車尾裝有預備車輪一個。係深陷於尾壁者。其地位與帷圍頗爲接近也。</p>
<p>全車機構上之改革。亦經一番苦心。無不力趨上乘。從前式樣之車。其炭化合器及輸送器之位置均頗不易討好。後者大都裝置於水箱之後面。新車爲免除此種短處起見。曾於設計時費去極多之經費。以求盡善盡美。結果則將油櫃自車底搬置於車後身。其他機構方面搬改亦多。</p>
<p>此車初次登塲時。製造廠方面聲稱其速率爲每小時五十五英里。此種規定於布羅克蘭地方測騐時。殊能證實無誤。當其最初之半英里駛行時。其速率爲每小時五十四英里又五五。其最鉅之速率爲每小時五十七英里。以有限之引擎力量。而有若是之成績固屬不易也。試車時平穩而出。毫不覺有跳躍不　之　。即至慢擋調至快擋亦無特異之可　處。在二</p>

<h3>Can the Japanese-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty Be Established?</h3>
<p>By Zi</p>
<p>The Japanese-Russian relationship, shrouded in smoke, is what concerned Chinese people have been diligently studying recently, seeking to understand its true nature. The general public has three questions about the Japanese-Russian relationship. The first is whether Japan and Russia can get closer. This can be seen from the establishment of the oil contract between the two countries on the 24th. The second is what is the true state of Soviet Russia? This can be inferred from the news from Moscow on the 25th that the Russian authorities denied that they would recognize the puppet state. The third is whether there is a possibility of establishing a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, which is the basis of Japanese-Russian relations and has an important connection with the Northeast Incident. Now, let's discuss this in this article.</p>
<p>Neither Japan nor Russia is a country that is willing to accept humiliation and concession. Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, Soviet Russia has disregarded its rights in northern Manchuria and has repeatedly suffered humiliation. Since this spring, Japan has also changed its provocative policy toward Russia and expressed concession. This is not because the two countries do not want to fight or cannot fight, but because they each want to find a way to defeat the enemy in one battle, waiting for an opportunity. If Japan starts a war against Russia, it must not only occupy Vladivostok with the navy from Chongjin Port, cover the army's rapid rush to Hailanpao, and echo the army attacking from the Middle East Railway, thwarting the vigor of the Russian army and causing internal chaos in Russia. Otherwise, it will take a long time and will inevitably lead to failure. On the other hand, if Soviet Russia starts a war against Japan, it must not only have sufficient war preparations at the eastern end of the Amur Railway, but also create a force in Manchuria that can echo each other, destroying the main force of the Japanese army in one fell swoop. Otherwise, it must not only consider the sacrifice of the five-year plan, but also have many concerns, so it is better not to fight. However, these are not easy to achieve, and each is subject to constraints, so their plans cannot be actively carried out. Therefore, the Japanese side avoids a breakup by making concessions, and strives to consolidate its position in Manchuria to avoid the impact of the rear during the war against Russia. Russia seeks temporary peace through humiliation, concentrating its strength near Chita to diligently prepare for war. Under this situation where neither side has a sure grasp of victory and each seeks to avoid contact temporarily, they maintain their peace through a superficial, unbroken relationship. From this superficial peaceful relationship, they gradually approach each other and seek a win-win situation through diplomatic means. Finally, they have to test the possibility of avoiding war between the two countries with the issue of the Russian side proposing to conclude a non-aggression treaty. This is how the recent foreign telegrams about the Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty came about.</p>
<p>If we want to determine whether this non-aggression treaty between Japan and Russia can be established, we should first examine the fundamental strategies that the two countries treat each other with. What we know about this fundamental strategy is that the Japanese side wants to use Semenov to create a White Russian state in Siberia as a buffer for a direct war between Japan and Russia and as a shield for the territories occupied by the Japanese in Manchuria. The Soviet Russia wants to maintain a state of peace to wait for the success of its five-year plan and to seek the eastward development of its ideology without hindrance. If the Japanese plan succeeds, Soviet Russia will not only lose territory, but also the road for its ideology to develop eastward will be blocked. How can Russia tolerate this? If the Soviet Russian plan succeeds, Japanese imperialism will become a fish in a kettle. This is also unacceptable to Japan. The fundamental plans of the two countries confront each other in this way. This is enough to prove that their non-aggression treaty cannot be established at all.</p>
<p>Japanese news agencies report that Soviet Russia has proposed to conclude a non-aggression treaty, and that Japan has a rejecting attitude. This is clear evidence that Japan is unwilling to give up its plan to use Semenov to create a White Russian state in Siberia. Soviet Russia denies that it will recognize the puppet state. This indicates that although the oil contract has been concluded, if the non-aggression treaty cannot be concluded, the confrontational situation between the two countries has not changed. Therefore, the core of the problem lies in one question: Can Japan abandon its fundamental plan to stop Semenov's activities in Siberia? If the Japanese side wants to implement reconciliation with Soviet Russia as it has publicized, it must abandon its fundamental plan. Otherwise, maintaining the confrontational situation will only make up for Russia's weak transportation capacity. Here, we see the pungent diplomatic skills of the Karakhan and his ilk in the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty. What is hidden by the smoke screen of Japanese-Russian relations is this pungent diplomatic skill of the Russian authorities. The futility of the Japanese is the inevitable consequence.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Korean Army Takes Over Defense of Eight Counties in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>Fighting Still Occurs in Yexian, Korean Army Occupies Eastern Gate</p>
<p>(Qingdao) On the morning of the 26th, the Korean and Liu armies were still engaged in fierce fighting in Yexian County. The Korean army's mortar team and one plane went to assist in the battle and soon occupied the Eastern Gate. The Liu army retreated into the city. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Rong Guangxing, the Brigade Commander of the 87th Brigade, went to Shahe from Pingdu yesterday. It is said that the Liu army in Laiyang is forcibly conscripting laborers, actively digging trenches, and requisitioning food, cotton clothes, and carts. Rong returned to Pingdu that night.</p>
<p>Yesterday, several hundred of the Liu army in Yexian came out of the city again and harassed with hand grenades. The provincial army did not retaliate. After about two hours, the Liu army retreated back into the city. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Korean Army Occupies Longkou Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>(Yantai) The statement that Liu Zhennian is now leading 8,000 troops besieged in Laizhou has been confirmed. It is said that there are six months of military supplies prepared in the city, and it is expected that they will be able to hold out for a long time. 5,000 Korean troops occupied Longkou this morning. The main force of the Korean army is about 8,000 to 10,000 troops and is now heading to Yantai along the highway. It is expected that they will occupy Huangxian tonight, and then reach Dengzhou, namely Penglai, tomorrow. The reason for such slow progress is that the roads are bad and they must deploy step by step. The arrival of the Korean army in Yantai can be expected, but they must first reach Fushan, where the remaining soldiers of Liu will probably resist. The telegraph communication between Yantai and Laiyang was interrupted early this morning, indicating that the Korean army has advanced to Laiyang. Yantai is still peaceful due to naval protection, but the four villages are troubled by deserters. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Korean Sends Cavalry to Take Over Defense of Eight Counties</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Korean army sent a cavalry brigade under Li Xuande to take over the defense of various places. They arrived today in the eight counties of Huangxian, Laiyang, Penglai, Haiyang, Wendeng, Muping, Qixia, and Rongcheng. The county magistrates appointed by Liu Zhennian have now been removed by the provincial government, and others have been sent to unify the Jiaodong regime. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Han Fuju Convenes Military Conference</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju summoned Sun Tongxuan, Qiao Lizhi, Zhan Shutang, and other division commanders to Jinan, as well as the brigade commanders and chiefs of the headquarters in Jinan. They held a meeting on the 26th. Han reported on the progress of the war in eastern Shandong and told everyone to be at ease in suppressing bandits and not to believe rumors. Today, Sun returned to Yan and Qiao returned to De. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Missionaries in Shandong Province Evacuate to the Coast</p>
<p>(Yantai) The war in Shandong Province has caused missionaries in many places to evacuate to the coast for safety. Fortunately, none of them were killed or injured, but they suffered greatly on the way, because there has been heavy rain for several days, and there is standing water everywhere in the countryside. Men and women have traveled through it, some for more than a hundred miles, and their suffering can be imagined. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Zhang Yue Arrives in Nanjing to See He Yingqin</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yue, the representative of Han Fuju, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 27th. He visited He Yingqin and presented Han's handwritten letter to He and described that Han had complied with the order to cease military action and had begun to withdraw the forward troops to await the central government's orders to resolve the situation. It was decided that he would fly to Lushan on the morning of the 28th to report the incident to Chiang and ask for instructions on everything. Also, He Yisan, the deputy division commander of the 21st Division, telegraphed Yang Licuan, the division's representative in Nanjing, on the 26th, saying that Han had telegraphed Minister He, saying, "Our division, in addition to those captured and scattered, still has 4,000 to 5,000 people, firmly guarding the three counties of Yexian, Laiyang, and Muping," etc. Such propaganda is purely fabricated and intended to deceive the central government. Our division has repeatedly made concessions to maintain peace and protect the local area. The troops are completely concentrated in Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia, and have not lost a single gun or soldier. The morale is extremely high. Yantai and Longkou were evacuated by our division on our own. The local public security bureau maintains the local security, and the order is very good. We hope that you will report the real situation to Minister He to clarify the truth, etc. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Shuxiang, Han Fuju's chief of staff, telegraphed Tang Xiangyun on the 26th, "Our army has been withdrawing from the front to Jinan for the past three days. Unexpectedly, Liu Zhennian's army has repeatedly attacked our army while our front troops are being withdrawn to the rear. Last night, they fired more than 200 artillery shells at our army. Liu's Laiyang troops also advanced towards our side the night before yesterday." (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian Decides to Defend Laizhou Firmly</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources in Beiping today, Liu Zhennian has prepared a coffin for himself and expressed his determination to defend Laizhou firmly against the Korean army. He has also posted slogans such as "We are not afraid of death" and "We are determined to defend the city at the cost of sacrifice" all over the besieged city. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative, Han Dong, has completed his visit to Chiang in Xun and flew to Nanjing on the 27th. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Statements by Liu Zhennian's Representative</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Suru, the representative of Liu Zhennian, the commander of the 21st Division, went north by sea and arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 26th. According to his statement, the Korean army mobilized to the east on the 14th and concentrated in Weixian, Fangzi, and Changyi on the 15th. On the evening of the 16th, Division Commander Liu received the report and immediately telegraphed his troops to concentrate in Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia, and issued instructions that, during this period of serious national crisis, the military should be united against foreign aggression and should not start another civil war. All my officers and soldiers should understand this and do their best to defend the city and protect the people. All follow-up matters should await the central government's orders.

<h3>Chiang Formulates Major Plan to Handle Post-Disaster Relief in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Ying said that the bandits and communists in the east, west, north, and central parts of Hubei Province have been almost completely suppressed. They are currently suppressing the remaining bandits in the Honghu and Mianyang areas of southern Hubei. It is expected that they can be completely eliminated in one month. As for the politics of Hubei Province, I have discussed it in detail with Chiang, and it is actually caused by the poor local government. The people in Huang'an, Honghu, and other places joined the communists for three reasons: 1. voluntary joining; 2. forced joining; 3. joining because they cannot maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, Chiang has recently formulated the following major plan to handle post-disaster relief in bandit areas: 1. restore the rural economy; 2. promote education; 3. vigorously develop transportation. Chiang believes that restoring the bankrupt rural economy is the most necessary, and has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds to set up farmers' loan offices in Hubei to enable poor farmers to circulate the economy. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>

At this time, it is impossible to eliminate the roots without clearing the countryside and searching the mountains. However, it concerns civil administration and borders three provinces. It is proposed to order the heads of the civil affairs departments of the three provinces to personally lead the autonomous and security teams, and to help the party members, to handle autonomy in the counties connected to the border areas of the three provinces, to guide the people, and to eliminate the permanent troubles in three months. Otherwise, stationing troops will restrain military strength, and once they are transferred, the bandits will take the opportunity to rise again, and it will be impossible to defend against them, and the troubles will never end.

<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen told a reporter from a certain agency that he did not meet Sun Zhesheng in Shanghai, and he also did not hear that the central government had proposed to reinstate Sun as the president of the Executive Yuan. The government did not blockade the Northeast customs. Because Japan instigated the puppet organization to gradually seize all the rights of our Northeast, we had to take the last resort to make the puppet organization unable to seize them. I think the international community should understand our suffering. Currently, our country is unable to collect legal tariffs at the ports of the three eastern provinces, so we have adopted a simple method to collect the tariffs that should have been collected at the Northeast customs at the customs outside the Northeast to the extent possible. As for the loss, it is of course very large. Dalian, because the Japanese authorities violated the agreement and refused to allow Chinese customs to exercise their functions, therefore, this time, the order was issued to the customs of Harbin, Niuzhuang, Andong, Longkoucun, etc. to follow the transfer method within our scope. Song's pilot, Sears, waited at the airport at 8:00 a.m. on the 28th to fly to Guling to visit Chiang. (Special Telegram on the 27th)</p>

<h3>The Steel Plant Site Will Be in Pukou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Jintao, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, said that the steel plant originally planned to add an import tax of 1.5 yuan per ton on coal and steel imported through customs, which would generate over 3 million yuan annually. Moreover, China's annual steel imports, excluding the Northeast, are still over 400,000 tons, so adding a tax of 5 yuan per ton is still lower than the import taxes of other countries and can generate over 2 million yuan annually. Therefore, the tax revenue will be around 6 million yuan, which will be used as a fund to issue 40 million yuan in public bonds, which are expected to be repaid in seven years. Furthermore, the coal for the steel plant will be supplied by the Lieshan Coal Mine, and I will also serve as the general manager of the plant. The mine will be mortgaged for 40 million yuan, which has been approved by the German side. The plant site is planned to be in Pukou, but it needs to await the approval of the military authorities.

<h3>The Incident of Two Englishmen Being Kidnapped in Newchwang</h3>
<p>(Newchwang) The weather is clearer today, and the messenger should be able to return early. The estimated round trip will take about five days, as the messenger is unwilling to travel by train and is taking a roundabout route. It has been seven days since the first messenger set off. A total of ten messengers have been sent out, and we are constantly hoping for one to return. It was learned yesterday that the kidnapped individuals are in a very difficult situation. They have not had a bath since the incident, and the package of soap sent was likely stolen. They have barely enough to eat each day, mainly coarse grains saved by the bandits, occasionally mixed with the items sent. It is suspected that many of these items were also stolen by the bandits. It is reported that the bandit leader used to be a carpenter in Newchwang. When he and three accomplices planned the kidnapping, there were about 70 bandits in the gang, but now it has increased to several hundred. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>Postal Plane Crashes in Hankou</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Yesterday, a postal plane here suddenly tilted its nose down and crashed into the river while test flying, apparently due to a malfunction. The Taikoo Company's Poyang steamer happened to be passing by and immediately sent a lifeboat to rescue them. However, the three foreigners and one Chinese on board were all unharmed and were rescued before the lifeboat arrived. Only one person was injured in the nose. The plane has sunk into the river. A follow-up telegram said that according to officials of the China Aviation Company, the plane has been salvaged and suffered little damage and will be transported to Shanghai for repairs tonight. The plane crash was apparently caused by hitting the mast of a civilian ship. The pilot was an American named Smith, and the names of the passengers are unknown. Furthermore, according to officials of the company, the plane flew from Shanghai and was moored on Sunday, but suddenly drifted away from its mooring place. Fortunately, no one was on board at the time, and the mail had also been unloaded. The two coolies guarding the plane quickly took a sampan to chase after it and eventually towed the plane back to its original location. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Discussion at the Japanese Foreign Ministry Regarding the Investigation Report and Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Even Nominal Sovereignty of Eastern Provinces Will Not Be Tolerated</p>
<p>The China Press Agency, Tokyo, 27th. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, having learned of the Lytton Report's conclusion that the puppet organization should be granted autonomy while nominal sovereignty should remain with China, has held a series of key meetings to discuss rebutting arguments. It is reported that they will adopt the following theoretical framework:</p>
<p>(1) Manchuria is already independent. Regardless of the reasons for its existence, the existing facts should be the basis for resolving the Liaoning issue. Therefore, the Lytton proposal cannot be agreed to. (2) Manchuria is the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty. Under the former Qing rule, it was a purely restricted area where Han Chinese were not allowed to migrate. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as the original territory of China. (3) The independence of Manchuria is the result of self-determination by 30 million people and the restoration of its original territory by the Qing Dynasty, which has nothing to do with Japan. All countries must respect national self-determination.</p>
<p>The Denstu News Agency, Tokyo, 27th. The full text of the Lytton Report will be released on October 1st. According to reliable sources, its conclusion proposes that Manchuria be granted extensive autonomy and that China be granted only a very weak nominal sovereignty. The Japanese Foreign Ministry will refute the investigation team's avoidance of the term "suzerainty" and use of the term "nominal sovereignty" in its opinion paper, which is currently under study. The use of the term "nominal sovereignty" is rarely cited in international practice. No matter how weak the powers of the suzerain state, acknowledging it contradicts the fact that Manchuria already exists as an independent state, so it is absolutely opposed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 27th. The League of Nations originally planned to release the Lytton Report on Saturday. This plan may need to be changed. Japan wants three days to study the contents of the report after receiving it before publishing it. However, the League of Nations suggests that the report be sent to the Chinese and Japanese governments early Saturday morning to allow them to review the full text, and then distributed to the newspapers in the evening. At the same time, the Secretariat of the League of Nations will release the report around noon on Saturday, so that Japan will have eight hours to understand its contents and translate it. The publication date will probably be delayed until Sunday, but whether this will be the case is still questionable.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations General Assembly Elected All Officers, Japan Still Elected as Vice-President</h3>

<p>[P The Executive Yuan Held a Secret Meeting Yesterday and Decided to Approve Drummond's Resignation&gt;</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 27th. The Executive Council of the League of Nations held a secret meeting this morning and approved the resignation of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond. Drummond will leave office from June 1933. The successor will be designated by a special session of the League of Nations in November this year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 27th. The Executive Council of the League of Nations unexpectedly convened a meeting this morning to discuss the agenda, including the issue of promoting peace by the international press and the British representative's proposal that the Committee of Experts on Economic Conference should meet in Geneva under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. This afternoon, the Executive Council began discussing the Secretary-General's annual report. It is expected that the Chinese Chief Representative, Dr. Yen, will be one of the speakers at that time.</p>
<h3>French Premier Meets with Simon</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 26th. French Premier Herriot's conversation with British Foreign Minister Simon this evening ended prematurely because Simon was eager to take a night train back to London. As for the content of the conversation, Herriot declined to comment, only saying that he could not yet determine when he could meet with the German Foreign Minister. In addition, everything else is still without a definite plan. The Executive Committee of the Disarmament Conference has been scheduled to meet on October 10, and it is expected that the German demands for equality will be discussed at that time.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Exposed its Weakness</h3>
<p>Its Lifespan is Feared to be Short</p>
<p>A New Organization Will Be Formed to Welcome US Membership</p>
<p>Washington Star's Speculation</p>
<p>World News Agency, Washington. The Washington Star carried an article from its Paris correspondent, predicting that the lifespan of the League of Nations is coming to an end, which has attracted general attention. The article stated that the League of Nations is currently facing a serious crisis, and both Britain and France are studying the possibility of replacing the League of Nations with another international organization that includes the United States. There are various reasons for the increase in this kind of opinion, as follows: (1) The United States and Russia have never joined the League of Nations. The United States currently has no specific form, (2) Britain has lost its previous position with the League of Nations. Over the years, Britain's attitude towards the League of Nations has been quite negative. MacDonald seems to want international disputes to be resolved through direct negotiations between the parties concerned, rather than through the League of Nations. (3) Germany has expressed its intention to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. If France uses the League of Nations to put pressure on Germany on the grounds that Germany has violated its treaty obligations, Germany will definitely withdraw. If Germany withdraws, Italy will follow suit, and Hungary and Austria will also tend to withdraw. (4) Over the past year, the League of Nations has exposed its weakness in dealing with the Far East issue. Japan has completely ignored it and is now threatening to withdraw. (5) The League of Nations has no solution to the dispute between Bolivia and Uruguay. Also, the resignation of Secretary-General Sir Drummond, the financial problems of the League of Nations, and the allocation of funds are all difficulties for the League of Nations. Among them, the most important and dangerous for the League's relationship are the issues of Manchuria and Germany. Japan's advance or retreat depends on the content of the Investigation Team's report. Germany's advance or retreat depends on the situation in France. If countries such as Germany, Japan, and Italy withdraw from the League, what remains will only be Britain and France. However, since Britain's attitude is as mentioned above, under such circumstances, it may be difficult to extend the League's fate. Therefore, the General Assembly that should have been held in early September has been postponed to the fourth week. The Disarmament Conference and the compromise with France and Germany have also been postponed in response. Now Japan has requested a six-week postponement for the review of the Lytton Report. The internal cracks in the League are becoming increasingly deep. At the same time, in order to seek reform, it is planned to welcome the United States to form another organization.</p>
<h3>Japan's Army and Navy Strength</h3>
<p>Boasting that They Can Defeat Russia and the US?</p>
<p>The Nagoya News stated that today, in order to carry out national policy, our country (referring to Japan) opposes party politics and the military is the main body in deciding all national affairs. In particular, foreign policy is also guided by the military, which is an undeniable fact. Under these circumstances, our military department is confident that the strength of the army and navy occupies an absolute advantage. Because the military department is confident in this advantage, it can influence national policy. Currently, among our country's foreign relations, the most important things to be wary of are the Pacific Ocean and Siberia. In other words, it is the United States and Soviet Russia. What the United States boasts about is its navy, and what Soviet Russia boasts about is its army. These two countries are our country's great enemies. However, according to the opinions of our military experts, Russia and the United States are not to be feared. Although we cannot compare the strength of the two countries in detail, the overall situation regarding the current state of the US Navy is that we have an equivalent amount of holdings. There is no great difference in quantity. According to the London Treaty, at the end of 1936, our navy's ratio to the US navy, in terms of battleships, will be 10 to 6, and the ratio of auxiliary ships will be 10 to 7. But now our country is at a great advantage. As for the comparison of strength with the Soviet Russian army, the characteristic of the Russian army is the training of mechanized corps and the strengthening of the air force as advocated by the Russian People's Commissar for the Army and Navy, Voroshilov. However, although the number of Russian planes is greater than that of our country, their quality is inferior to that of our country. Although they use mechanized corps, it is still questionable whether tanks and armored vehicles can move at will in the wilderness of Siberia. However, the Red Guard in the Soviet Russian army does have its own special features. Because this army understands the purpose of war, its spiritual strength in combat is particularly excellent. However, our country's army soldiers will not show weakness to others in the event of war. In short, our army and navy today occupy various advantages in both the Pacific and Siberia. Moreover, the US Navy will still need a considerable amount of time to reach the quantity stipulated by the London Treaty, and the Russian army will also need time to strengthen its air force and complete its mechanized corps. Therefore, the current strength of our army and navy can be boasted of as an invincible fleet in the world. This is a fact in our country's history. Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, our country's determination to use this strength to confront the world is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Free Trade Dispute Brews Political Turmoil in Britain</h3>
<p>Free Party Cabinet Members Will Resign</p>
<p>Simon's Faction Expresses Support for the Government</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th. The dispute over free trade in the British Cabinet is about to cause great political turmoil. Lord Privy Seal Snowden, Home Secretary Samuel, Scottish Secretary Sinclair, and Secretary of Mines Foot seem likely to resign within this week, and other cabinet members with free trade beliefs will follow suit. The cabinet is scheduled to convene a meeting on the 28th of this month (Wednesday), and it is expected that all cabinet members will attend. Foreign Secretary Simon has left Geneva by train tonight to attend the cabinet meeting, and will fly to London from Paris tomorrow. Conservative Party leader Baldwin returned here yesterday and met with Prime Minister MacDonald for a long time. It is reported that the Prime Minister is doing his best to mediate in the Conservative Party key members meeting, hoping to avoid the cabinet from splitting at this time. However, since the establishment of the National Government, cabinet members have had quite divergent opinions on tariff issues. It has been able to maintain itself until now thanks to the method that cabinet members can express different opinions on this issue. This method has never been seen before in British politics. Cabinet members have repeatedly spoken and voted against the government in Congress, but they are still cabinet members. This is something that was not available in previous years. The National Free Party Executive Committee passed a resolution last week criticizing several agreements established at the Ottawa Conference. Therefore, Wednesday's cabinet meeting is highly valued. Home Secretary Samuel mentioned in this Executive Committee the temporary measures agreed to by the Free Party cabinet members, which have now been submitted to Prime Minister MacDonald. According to the Times, what the Free Party cabinet members oppose most is the clause in the Ottawa Agreement that "if the overseas self-governing territories do not agree, certain foreign goods may not be reduced in import duties within the next five years." The Free Party believes that this clause directly deprives the British Parliament of its constitutional power to control the budget and makes the British Parliament obey the will of the self-governing territories' parliaments. The Times also said that the Free Party cabinet members are likely to oppose it to the end. Therefore, the only way to maintain the current cabinet to tide over the period of the World Economic Conference is to delay the legislation arising from the Ottawa resolutions. However, this move may not be approved by the majority of cabinet members. It is now known that a temporary plan has been set to submit the aforementioned legislation when Congress reconvenes on October 18. It is believed that even if the Free Party cabinet members resign, they will not join the opposition party, but will still stand on the government's side and continue to cooperate with the government on other issues besides the Ottawa legislation. Free Party cabinet members Simon and Runciman have declared to the Prime Minister that they are still willing to stay in office to assist as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Havas, 26th. There will be changes in the British Cabinet in the near future. It is reported that Lord Privy Seal Snowden may resign. Snowden was the Chancellor of the Exchequer when MacDonald previously organized the Labour Cabinet. When the National Government was established in August 1931, he joined the cabinet again with several of his former colleagues, still in charge of finance. When the cabinet was reshuffled on November 6 of the same year, he was reassigned as Lord Privy Seal. Snowden is the most loyal believer in free trade. Since the government implemented a protectionist policy, although his and his colleagues' actions have not been obstructed, he privately does not agree with the views of most cabinet members. This is known to everyone. MacDonald and Baldwin are quite worried about Snowden's resignation, more so than the withdrawal of Samuel's faction. The departure of Samuel's faction is expected, and their departure can be replaced by Simon's faction of the Free Party. As for Snowden, he was formerly the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and his prestige is extraordinary. If his resignation really materializes, the reputation of the Labour Cabinet will suffer a fatal blow.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Wins Victory in Sofia Local Elections</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Political Change in Bulgaria</p>
<p>National News Agency, Sofia, 26th. An unprecedented political change has taken place in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, namely that the Communist Party has manipulated the absolute majority in the local elections. In this election, the Communist Party won 20 seats, while the government group only won 12 seats. The Tsankov People's Democratic Party won 3 seats, and there are as many as 15 other small parties, but none of them won a seat. As for the outcome of the election, how the government will deal with it is still undecided. However, people in political circles deeply believe that the administration of Sofia will not immediately fall into the hands of the Communist Party, because there are 276 seats in the Bulgarian parliament, and the Communist Party only occupies 33 of them.</p>
<h3>Herriot's Disarmament Speech Arouses German Reaction</h3>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 26th. Last Sunday, French Premier Herriot gave a speech in Gramat on the issue of disarmament, warning the world not to allow Germany to restore its armaments, lest it repeat its previous mistakes, and declaring France's desire for peace. German National Socialist Party leader Hitler criticized the French Premier's speech in the National Observer with harsh rhetoric, accusing the French Premier of being arrogant and hypocritical, intentionally inverting the facts, and ridiculing the French Premier's claim that France's motives were purely out of a desire for peace. He concluded by saying that given the attitude of the Herriot government, the Papen government's proposal to France on the issue of disarmament was a mistake. The French Premier's remarks have also caused consternation in the League of Nations, because the French Premier's attitude is still not accommodating, and there is concern that all efforts to persuade Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference will be in vain.</p>
<h3>Hoover's Nationality Issue in the US Presidential Campaign</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 26th. As the US presidential campaign is in full swing, a strange rumor has suddenly arisen, saying that President Hoover was a registered voter in the UK from 1911 to 1925. Thus, the question of whether Hoover is a subject of Great Britain has become the subject of public discussion. The UK Identity Registration Bureau has specifically investigated this matter. Whether Hoover is a British voter is questionable, but it has been confirmed that there is no such person as Mr. Hu in the British Register of Persons. Where the misrepresentation lies is still under investigation. According to the US Constitution, only citizens born in the United States can be president. If the aforementioned rumor is true, the consequences are difficult to predict, because the Constitution has not specifically stipulated it, and there are no precedents in history to be found. All we know is that the UK Identity Registration Bureau's investigation is of great interest to the leaders of the Democratic Party.</p>

<h3>Military Affairs in Jiaodong Have Not Yet Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian's Army Still Has Active Operations</p>
<p>Han Fuju Also May Go to the Front Again to Negotiate</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Jiang Bocheng was ordered to come to Shandong to mediate the conflict between Han and Liu, Han Fuju ordered the troops at the front to stop attacking, and Han himself rushed back to Jinan to show his intention to stop before it was too late. As for the various armies at the front after the ceasefire, except for a part that has been withdrawn, the rest have been reorganized and are commanded by Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division, to await the central government's aftermath measures. However, according to front-line telegrams, Liu Zhennian's troops still seem to have active operations, and the situation is not yet optimistic. Therefore, there is also talk that Han Fuju will go to eastern Shandong again in the next day or two. The news from all sides is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Liu's Army's Deployment and Its Plans According to the quartermaster general of Liu's army obtained by the province, Liu's army has a total of 12 regiments and 2 battalions. Six regiments and two battalions are trapped in Yexian, three regiments in Laiyang, and one regiment each in Muping and Qixia. The training regiment was originally stationed in Yantai and is now being transferred to Qixia. Zhaoyuan and Huangxian are empty. Liu's army's deployment is roughly like this. According to news from Huangxian, there are no traces of Liu's army there. A battalion of Liu's army in Yexian retreated from behind the Hai Temple. Yesterday, they wanted to enter Huangxian City, but the people in the city closed the gates and refused. The battalion then looted two villages near Huangxian and fled to Qixia in the southeast. At the same time, the Liu's army stationed in Laiyang also left the city yesterday and advanced to the northwest. Judging from their purpose, it is either to aid Yexian or Zhaoyuan. Furthermore, the coastal ports such as Longkou, Yantai, Dengzhou, etc., Liu's troops have all withdrawn, and the navy has taken over. It seems that Liu's plan has changed again, abandoning Huangxian, Zhaoyuan, Penglai, and Fushan, and defending the four counties of Yexian, Muping, Laiyang, and Qixia, because Muping and Yexian have both built solid fortifications and want to decide the final victory or defeat here.</p>
<p>Han's Army Takes Over Defense of Longkou and Yantai Zhao Mingyuan, commander of the Ludong Militia of Han's army, is currently leading his militia to surround Laiyang County. The Liu's army in Longkou had already withdrawn, and the marine corps took over. On the 24th, the Liu's army reappeared in Yantai, and sailors and soldiers landed again to maintain order. Navy Commander Shen Honglie telegraphed Han Fuju yesterday, stating that the landing of the Marine Corps was only to maintain order and would not interfere in local politics, and asked him to send someone to sort things out as soon as possible. It is reported that Li Xuande, commander of the cavalry brigade of Han's army, has led his troops to Longkou today (the 25th) and will be able to reach Yantai on the 26th to take over the defense.</p>
<p>Newly Appointed County Magistrate and Public Security Bureau Chief Zhu Kuaisheng, the county magistrate of Fushan County, was originally appointed by the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs. He was driven out by Liu Zhennian, who appointed someone else. Zhu has now come to Jinan from Tianjin (his family has also come) and it is currently unknown whether he will return to his post. The chief of the Yantai Public Security Bureau fled after the incident. Now the Provincial Government has appointed Counselor Zhang Kuiwen as his successor. Zhang is currently in Shahe, and the Provincial Government has telegraphed him to go to Yantai as soon as possible to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>Han Guarantees Zhang Huacun as a Provincial Committee Member Liu Zhennian originally also served as a member of the Shandong Provincial Government. Since the beginning of this incident, all members of the Provincial Government have telegraphed the Central Government to deprive Liu of all his concurrent posts. After Han Fuju returned to Jinan, he telegraphed to guarantee Zhang Huacun, a member of the Shandong Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, as his successor. The original telegram is as follows: "President Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Acting President of the Executive Yuan Song, General Commander of Jiujiang Jiang Junjian: I, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, respectfully report that Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 21st Division of the Army and member of the Shandong Provincial Government, has already been telegraphed by all members of the Provincial Government to be deprived of all his concurrent posts. Regarding the post of member of the Provincial Government left vacant, I have learned that Zhang Huacun, a member of the Shandong Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, has a deep history in the Party and the country and is unanimously respected in the locality. I request that you approve and issue a clear order appointing him as a member of the Provincial Government to assist me and comfort the people. I am anxiously awaiting your order. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, bows with seal."</p>
<p>Han Sends Representatives to Nanjing and Hankou In addition to telegraphing the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin, Chairman of the Hankou Military Commission Jiang Jieshi, and Zhang Xueliang in Beiping from the Shache military office on the 23rd, reporting that he had complied with the order to stop military actions, Han Fuju also sent Director Niu Zhaoju and Liu Xizhong as representatives after returning to Jinan, taking the Pingpu train to Beiping at 6 PM today to visit Zhang Xueliang and report on the ceasefire situation. At the same time, he sent Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue to Nanjing and Hankou to report to the Central Government and Chairman Jiang. Zhang will take the Pingpu train south tomorrow morning (the 25th) at 9:30.</p>

<p>Middle speeches and voted against the government, yet still remained cabinet members. This was unprecedented in recent years. The National Liberal Party Executive Committee passed a resolution last week criticizing several collaborations established at the Ottawa Conference. Therefore, Wednesday's cabinet meeting is being taken very seriously. Home Secretary Samuel, at this executive committee, spoke of temporary measures agreed upon by Free Party cabinet members, which have now been submitted to Prime Minister MacDonald. According to the Times, what Free Party cabinet members are most against is the clause in the Ottawa Agreement stipulating, "if overseas autonomous regions do not agree, some tariffs on foreign goods may not be reduced within the next five years." The Free Party believes this clause directly strips the British parliament of its constitutional right to control the budget and makes the British parliament obey the wishes of autonomous region parliaments. The Times also said that Free Party cabinet members will likely oppose it to the end. Therefore, to maintain the current cabinet to survive the period of the World Economic Conference, the only method is to delay legislation arising from the Ottawa resolutions. However, this action may not be approved by a majority of cabinet members. It is now known that a temporary plan has been set to introduce the aforementioned legislation when parliament reconvenes on October 18. It is believed that even if Free Party cabinet members resign, they will not join the opposition party, but will still stand on the government's side and continue to cooperate with the government on other issues besides the Ottawa legislation. Free Party cabinet members Simon and Runciman have declared to the Prime Minister that they are still willing to remain in office to assist as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 26th. There will be changes in the British Cabinet in the coming days. It is reported that Lord Privy Seal Snowden may resign. Snowden was the Finance Minister when MacDonald previously organized the Labour Party cabinet. When the National Government was established in August 1931, he reunited with some of his former colleagues and joined the cabinet again, still in charge of finance. When the cabinet was reshuffled on November 6th of the same year, he was reassigned as Lord Privy Seal. Snowden is the most faithful believer in free trade. Since the government implemented protectionist policies, although the actions of he and his colleagues have not been obstructed, in his heart he does not approve of the claims of the majority of cabinet members. This is known to all. MacDonald and Baldwin are both quite worried about Snowden's resignation, even more so than the withdrawal of Samuel's faction. Samuel's faction's departure is expected, and their departure can be replaced by Simon's faction of the Free Party. As for Snowden, he was formerly the Finance Minister, and his prestige is unusual. If his resignation truly materializes, the reputation of the Labour Party cabinet will suffer a fatal blow.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Gains Victory in Sofia Local Elections</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Political Transformation in Bulgaria</p>
<p>National News Agency, Sofia, 26th. An unprecedented political transformation has occurred in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, namely, that the Communist Party has manipulated an absolute majority in the local elections. In this election, the number of seats won by the Communist Party was twenty, while government groups only obtained twelve seats. The Tsankov People's Democratic Party obtained three seats, other small parties are numerous, no less than fifteen types, but none obtained a seat. As for how the government will deal with the outcome of the election, no firm decision has been made yet. However, people in political circles deeply believe that the administration of Sofia will not immediately fall into the hands of the Communist Party, because there are two hundred and seventy-six seats in the Bulgarian parliament, and the Communist Party only occupies thirty-three seats.</p>
<h3>Herriot's Disarmament Speech Arouses Reactions from Germans</h3>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 26th. In his speech on the issue of disarmament in Gramat last Sunday, French Prime Minister Herriot warned the world not to allow Germany to restore its military, lest it repeat past mistakes, and declared France's desire for peace. The leader of the German National Socialist Party, Hitler, criticized the French Prime Minister's speech in the National Observer with harsh rhetoric, rebuking the French Prime Minister for being arrogant and hypocritical, intentionally inverting facts, and mocking the French Prime Minister's statement that France's motives were purely out of a desire for peace. He concluded by saying that in view of the attitude of the Herriot government, the Papen government's proposal to France on the issue of disarmament was a mistake. The French Prime Minister's remarks have also aroused anxiety on the League of Nations' side, because the French Prime Minister's attitude remains unaccommodating and there is concern that all efforts to persuade Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference will come to naught.</p>
<h3>Hoover's Nationality Question Amidst the US Presidential Election</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, 26th, London. As the US presidential election campaign is in full swing, a bizarre rumour has suddenly emerged, alleging that President Hoover was a registered voter in Britain between 1911 and 1925. Consequently, the question of whether Hoover is a subject of Great Britain has become a topic of public debate. The British National Registration Office has specially investigated this matter. Whether Hoover is a British voter remains in question, but it has already been confirmed that there is no "Mr. Hu" [Hoover] on the British electoral roll. Where the falsehood lies is still under investigation. According to the American Constitution, only a citizen born in the United States can serve as president. If the aforementioned rumour were true, the consequences would be difficult to predict, because the Constitution has no specific provision and there is no historical precedent to be found. All that we know is that the British National Registration Office's investigation has made Democratic Party leaders feel more interested.</p>

<h3>Military Conflict in Jiaodong Has Yet to Subside</h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian's Troops Still Undertake Active Operations</p>
<p>Han Fuju Also Possibly Travelling to the Front Again to Mediate</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Jiang Bocheng was ordered to come to Shandong to mediate the conflict between Han and Liu, Han Fuju's side ordered front-line troops to cease attacks, and Han himself rushed back to Jinan to signal a willingness to halt before it was too late. As for the front-line troops after the ceasefire, except for a portion that has already been withdrawn, the remainder has been reorganized under the command of Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division, to await the central government's handling of the aftermath. However, according to front-line telegrams, Liu Zhennian's troops still seem to be undertaking active operations, and the situation has not yet become optimistic. Therefore, there is also talk that Han Fuju will travel to eastern Shandong again within one or two days. A summary of the news from all sides is as follows:</p>
<p>Deployment and Plans of Liu's Troops According to the quartermaster general of Liu's troops obtained by the province, Liu's troops consist of twelve regiments and two battalions. Six regiments and two battalions are trapped in Yexian, three regiments are in Laiyang, and one regiment each is in Muping and Qixia.

Yesterday, they attempted to enter Huangxian City, but the people in the city closed the gates and refused. The battalion then looted two villages near Huangxian and fled to Qixia in the southeast. At the same time, the Liu's troops stationed in Laiyang also left the city yesterday and advanced towards the northwest. Judging from their purpose, it is either to aid Yexian or Zhaoyuan. Further evidence is that Liu's troops have withdrawn from coastal ports such as Longkou, Yantai, Dengzhou, etc., and the navy has taken over the defense. It seems that Liu's plan has changed again, abandoning Huangxian, Zhaoyuan, Penglai, and Fushan, and defending the four counties of Yexian, Muping, Laiyang, and Qixia, because solid fortifications have been built in both Muping and Yexian, and the final victory or defeat will be decided there.</p>

<h3>The Northeast Navy Takes Over Defense of Yantai and Longkou: A Detailed Account</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: After the Jiaodong Incident occurred, Liu's troops were stationed in both Yantai and Longkou. Fearing the war would spread, the chambers of commerce and foreign residents of both locations requested the Northeast Navy to send troops to land and provide protection. At the time, the navy did not agree because Liu's troops had not fully withdrawn. It wasn't until the 24th that Liu's troops had completely withdrawn from Longkou and Yantai. The navy then responded to the request of the chambers of commerce of both locations and landed troops on the same day to maintain local security. The details of the takeover are recorded below:</p>
<p>Longkou: Originally, a regiment of Liu's troops was stationed there. After the outbreak of the war, part of the regiment was transferred to the front lines. The navy ships Yongxiang and Chuyu were stationed there. When the war first broke out, the local chamber of commerce sent representatives to request the navy to land troops to protect Chinese and foreign merchants and residents, but the navy did not agree. It wasn't until the 21st that Liu's troops received orders to completely withdraw and took the head of the Public Security Bureau and the police with them. The local merchants and residents, with no one in charge, requested the navy for protection again. The captains of the Yongxiang and Chuyu then sent marines to land at 9 a.m. on the 22nd to maintain local order. Dai Wenjun, the captain of the Yongxiang, issued a proclamation to reassure the people. The original text is as follows: "Considering that this port is inhabited by both Chinese and foreigners, local order is of utmost importance. Our navy has the responsibility to maintain coastal security. I, the captain of this ship, have been ordered by Navy Commander Shen to be stationed in Longkou. Now that the troops stationed in this area have all withdrawn, and no government official is in charge, it would be inappropriate to ignore the situation. Therefore, I am leading my marines to temporarily station in this city to maintain order and protect foreign residents. All supplies will be provided by our own military and will not rely on the local area. Once a replacement arrives, we will immediately withdraw to our original ships. We hope that everyone will maintain order and carry on with their businesses. Anyone who disrupts the local area or causes trouble will be severely punished without leniency."</p>
<p>Yantai: Since the Jiaodong military conflict occurred, the Yantai Chamber of Commerce, with numerous rumors circulating in the city and the people being extremely uneasy, repeatedly requested the Zhaohao warship stationed in Yantai to send troops to maintain order. At the same time, the American consul also personally visited the Zhaohao twice, expressing the hope that some sailors would be dispatched to protect the area. At that time, the navy considered that there were still Liu's troops stationed there, and in order to avoid misunderstandings, it was not convenient to send sailors to land immediately. It wasn't until 9 p.m. on the 23rd that the remaining cavalry battalion of Liu's troops and the military police inspection office personnel all successively withdrew, and there was no trace of Liu's troops in Yantai. Then, representatives from the chamber of commerce and the consular corps boarded the ship one after another, strongly requesting that troops be dispatched immediately to land and protect Chinese and foreign merchants and residents. Therefore, the Zhaohao and Jiangli warships dispatched a part of the marines, led by Battalion Commander Zhang Heyan, to land at 1 a.m. on the 24th to maintain security and take over the east and west artillery forts of Yantai. Wang Zhaolin, the captain of the Zhaohao, issued a public notice to reassure the people and set up a temporary command post for the marines at the site of the old Haiyun Lianying on Dongshan. The merchants and residents, seeing that Liu's troops had peacefully withdrawn, were greatly relieved, and the city was stable. Yesterday, the Qingdao Naval Headquarters received a telegram of thanks from the local chamber of commerce. (26th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Arrives in Lu Mountain from Wuhan</h3>
<p>Xiong, Wu, Chen, etc. All Arrive in Lu to Request Instructions on Matters</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang, considering that the various Red bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been successively annihilated, specially went to Guangshan a few days ago to stay for a short period of recuperation. According to news from Jiujiang, Chairman Chiang arrived in Xun on the 22nd by the Xianning warship and then transferred to a car to climb Lu Mountain and stay at his villa. Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of the Interior, arrived in Lu from Nanjing on the 24th to meet with Chiang, reporting on the progress of his contact with the leaders of the Party, government, and military in Guangdong, Guangxi, and the Southwest. It is heard that other important central figures will also come to Lu in response to the needs of the situation. Whether Chiang will return to Wuhan or go to Nanjing will depend on the outcome of the consultations in Lu Mountain. Wu Qiwai and Chen Cheng's troops of the Gan Province have defeated the Red bandits who invaded the north. The main forces of Zhu, Mao, and Peng have retreated to the area north of Ningdu, including Wangbi, Xiaopu, Luokou, Longgang, and Dongshao, and are now being further besieged. Therefore, after Chairman Xiong Shihui received the telegram of Chiang's arrival in Lu on the morning of the 23rd, he took a special train to Xun and then to Lu to report on the situation of his administration and request instructions on the aftermath of the suppression of the Reds. Chen Cheng and Wu Qiwai, the two military commanders who returned to the province from the front line, and Guo Bingsheng, the newly surrendered bandit division commander, were summoned by Chiang via telegram on the 24th to go to Lu from the province. It is heard that Chen and Wu will report to Chiang on the recovery of Yihuang and Le'an, as well as the latest bandit situation, and request instructions on matters. Guo will report on the reorganization process and the internal affairs of the Red bandits. It is expected that they will return to the province and go to their defensive positions within two days.

<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Requesting Verification of the Levy of Land Survey Expenses: The county levies a charge of one dime per mu for land survey expenses. Even if the land is less than one mu, it is still calculated as one mu. The public considers the levy to be unfair and has risen up to demand that the levy be verified and collected according to the standard amount of mu, fen, li, and hao to ensure fairness. It is now learned that Zhu Shijin, Ju Chenglu, and twelve others, as well as Wang Tinggan, Du Ruozhou, and nine others, have successively petitioned the province to request correction. The general idea is that the national tax levy has tax amounts of mu, fen, li, and hao. Within the fixed amount, it is the people's duty. Any excess, even if it is a li or hao, is an extra levy for the state. The levy of land survey expenses is a common case throughout the province and should not be different. For example, the first phase of land price tax in Qingpu is levied along with the household tax and calculated according to the amount, one dime per mu, which is one fen per fen, which is the fairest. Songjiang has exceeded the limit of one hundred and one. The Finance Department has instructed to make receipts separately according to the Jiangning and Zhenjiang methods, which is more cumbersome and prone to abuse than levying along with the household tax. Jiangning is where the capital is located, and Zhenjiang is where the provincial capital is located, both being wealthy areas. How can they be compared with Songjiang? Land survey is an important national policy, and the expenses are borne by the people, which is natural. However, it is not fair to count nine fen and nine li and one li and one hao as one mu, and it also exceeds the fixed amount. At a time when the local area is haggard, how can the people bear it? It is also not appropriate to issue this in the era of political tutelage. In the past ten years, the people's burden on land has been several times higher than in the past, such as loan transport, deed verification, and various additional local expenses. They should ask the government to consider the people's difficulties and follow the precedents of Qingpu and other counties, ordering Songjiang County to verify and collect according to the household tax, to ensure uniformity and prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Nine County Land and Water Police Teams Depart to Suppress Bandits: The land and water police teams of Wu County, Kunshan, Qingpu, Wujiang, Jinshan, Songjiang, Yixing, Wuxi, and Wujin, according to the resolution of the Nine County Joint Defense Conference, were ordered to mobilize fully at 6 a.m. today (the 28th) and depart separately to the ports of Taihu Lake to thoroughly suppress the lake bandits.</p>
<p>Soil Merchant's Bribery Leads to Murder Case: He Zhaolin, a soil merchant from Shijianong, Shantang Street, outside the Minmen Gate, beat Jiang Gan Chen, a tobacco merchant, to death the other day when Jiang came to He's house to negotiate about the soil. Huang Zhendong, a patrol officer from the fourth precinct of the third division of the battalion, went to arrest him. At that time, someone came to Patrol Officer Huang to intercede, and Huang did not transfer the murderer to the bureau for handling, but kept him in the precinct for a day and a night. Later, He's family paid 3,400 yuan to bribe various parties to settle the matter. Patrol Officer Huang then obtained permission from Min Zhongqian, the director of the precinct, to release He. At the same time, the deceased's family petitioned the court for exemption from examination. Now, the case has been discovered by Chief Prosecutor Xu of the District Court, who issued an arrest warrant yesterday ordering the police to secretly arrest He Zhaolin and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Borrow Grain for Emergency Relief: The county government and the Finance Bureau, due to the interruption of tax revenue after the war and the lack of funds for public security, education, and various government agencies, ordered Zhang Zhenxiang and Wang Cunhou, etc., to be borrowing commissioners on the 25th, to go to the second district (Nanxiang), the seventh district (Ji Wang), and the eighth district (Anting) to persuade wealthy households to borrow winter grain to meet emergency needs.</p>
<p>Jiading-Nanxiang Shuttle Boat Changes Schedule: The Jiading connecting shuttle boat at the Nanxiang Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has changed its departure schedule starting from the 25th of this month.

<p>Survey of the New Autumn Cocoon Production: This year's autumn cocoon harvest is considered abundant due to suitable weather. However, the rural economy has completely collapsed, leaving farmers unable to afford seeds. In addition, due to successive years of poor harvests and falling cocoon prices, many have converted mulberry fields to grow autumn crops. There are not many mulberry leaves, and the number of cocoon farmers has also greatly decreased. According to statistics from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the annual autumn planting used to consume about 1.2 million sheets of silkworm eggs, but this year it is only 400,000 sheets. The average yield per sheet is about 15 catties. According to statistics from the two provinces, the production of fresh autumn cocoons is only 6 million dan. Most of it has now come to an end. There are about 300 Wuxi new cocoon merchants who go to various villages to rent shops and collect cocoons. However, due to the low output, the amount collected is also small. The total amount collected is estimated at more than 3,000 dan of dried cocoons. The best performers are Dingchang, Yongtai, and Gansheng factories.</p>

<p>Two Robbers Arrested in Liuzhuang Township Robbery Case: Zhangjia Oil Mill in Liuzhuang Township, Dongchen District, was robbed last month, and the owners, Zhang Bojian and Zhang Zhongren, were shot and killed. The case was reported and investigated. It is now learned that the local self-defense corps arrested the two robbers, Long Si (alias Bohe) and Yu Xijiang (alias Yu Chun), yesterday morning (the 24th). They were sent to the corps headquarters, where they confessed to the robbery. They have been sent to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Execution by Hanging of a Major Criminal Who Murdered Her Husband: Zhu's family in the third district of Huaiyin hired Sun Fengyou, a native of Shuyang, as a worker in 1921. However, Sun Fengyou secretly had an affair with Zhu's wife, Wang. On the night of April 18 of that year, Sun killed the master and abducted Wang to Shanghai, where they lived for two years. Sun then returned to Shu with Wang. As soon as they arrived in Wangying, Huaiyin, they were spotted by a member of the victim's family, who immediately reported it to the local Public Security Bureau, and they were arrested. The case was presented to the county government for trial. Now, an order has been received from the Supreme Court to immediately execute the death penalty by hanging. After receiving the order, the county government extracted the prisoner Sun Fengyou at 10 a.m. on the 23rd, verified his identity, and tied him to the execution ground outside the city.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhirui et al. to Chen Heqin Letter</h3>
<p>Discussing the Improvement of Elementary School Textbooks</p>
<p>Wang Zhirui and 36 others sent a letter to Chen Heqin yesterday, saying, "Mr. Heqin, I have read your petition of September 5, published in the Shen Bao, in which you, as the leading signatory, requested the Ministry of Education to reward private writing in order to improve elementary school textbooks and break away from the control and monopoly of booksellers. The words are earnest and deeply felt. However, in your presentation, when discussing the editing of elementary school textbooks, there are words such as 'booksellers hire penniless writers to copy old books and quickly produce books,' and a blanket criticism is made, saying that their books 'do not consider the needs of the times, the psychology of children, and have no ideal purpose.' We have edited elementary school textbooks and feel like we have been poisoned by an arrow when we read this. We are indignant and self-examining. Is it really so inferior that it has caused you to criticize us? Textbooks are a public tool of society and the food of children. Although the sellers are booksellers, the editors do not initially devote themselves to the booksellers. Even if we are extremely ignorant, we can still understand this meaning. Therefore, we have not dared not to exhaust our knowledge and take into account all aspects of the so-called 'needs of the times' and 'psychology of children.' The so-called 'one word and one sentence are often the result of painstaking effort.' We have tasted this kind of situation. You have also edited elementary school textbooks. We do not know how you 'vomited blood,' but judging from the results, we know that our efforts are not necessarily far inferior to yours. The 'objective attitude' and 'scientific method' are all nouns. Speaking them and writing them on paper does not mean that they are in our possession and that no one can discuss them. Their writing is easy, who cannot do it? If we want to follow the name and seek the truth, then the gains and losses are difficult to say. When you evaluate the works of others, you do not mention who the editor is, do not mark the name of the book, do not list specific examples, do not make an analytical study, but only give a blanket dismissal and sweep everything away with one stroke. What is meant by 'objective attitude'? What is meant by 'scientific method'? As for calling us 'penniless writers,' although it is a derogatory term in your mouth, we have nothing to be ashamed of. If we do not know right and wrong and do not know shame, it is a great humiliation that is difficult to wash away in our lifetime. Does 'penniless' also have the knowledge of one's conduct? The world is now respecting labor, and writing is also work. We are also ashamed of earning a living. Is a 'writer' not enough? From your words, it seems that the editing of elementary school textbooks must be done by the wealthy and famous. What logic is this? It is not for you to hide the fact that your words are inappropriate. Moreover, we have either served in the education sector or are still teaching. We are in the same profession as you. Either forced by demand or moved by interest, we believe we can still edit books, so we write as 'writers.' This is also the same ability as you. The only difference between us and you is the place of service. How can we despise each other because of this? We do not know what kind of position you are in. You advocate rewarding private writing and banning booksellers from monopolizing. We strongly agree, but you have not only insulted our books, but also insulted our people, and presented these insulting words to the Ministry of Education and published them in newspapers. Are you intentionally publicly insulting us? Please give us a clear reply in the newspaper as to what responsibility you should bear for publicly insulting others. You are wise and should know how to deal with it. I hereby respectfully wish you good health. Wang Zhirui, Wang Boxiang, Wang Jianxing, Zhu Wenshu, Zhu Yixin, Zhu Sudian, Shen Baiying, Shen Binglian, Lu Boyou, Zong Lianghuan, Zhou Jianren, Jin Zhaozhi, Fan Xiangshan, Wei Xiyu, Sun Bocai, Zhang Kuang, Zhang Xiaolou, Hua Rucheng, Hua Xiangzhi, Chuan Binran, Yu Shouzhen, Ye Shaojun, Yang Fuyao, Yang Hongqu, Dong Wenge, Ge Suicheng, Lei Juncui, Jiang Jingfu, Zhao Jingyuan, Liu Daiyu, Li Jinhui, Zheng Chang, Mi Zanzhi, Wei Yongxin, Su Zhaonong, Ang Yun, and Tong Qi.</p>

<p>Sunday: Donghua vs. French Club at the Baseball Field The Summer Football League final between East China and Lingnan was originally scheduled to be held on Saturday and Sunday. Now, due to various reasons, the two teams have agreed with the Football Association to change the original three-match, three-win method to a one-time match, which will be held on Saturday (the 1st).

<h3>North China International Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Xiaolongqiang Seizes the Championship</p>
<p>Gao Huimin Loses in Straight Sets</p>
<p>The North China International Grass Tennis Men's Singles Final between Gao Huimin and Xiaolongqiang was held at the British stadium on the afternoon of the 25th. In terms of the two players' skills, Gao Huimin was slightly inferior. In terms of experience, Xiaolongqiang was indeed more experienced. In this match, Xiaolongqiang's victory over Gao was as easy as turning his hand. The result was a total of three sets, with scores of 6-2, 6-2, and 6-2. The reason why Xiaolongqiang did not get a "goose egg" (zero score) was because his serve in one or two games was commendable. However, looking at the overall game, Xiaolongqiang also made many concessions.</p>
<h3>20th Army Football Team Returned to Sichuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sichuan 20th Army football team has participated in more than 20 matches during this competition in Shanghai. The results have been quite good, and it has been praised by people from all walks of life. After the team concluded its competition in Shanghai, it went to West Lake for sightseeing to recover. The team took a civil ship back to Sichuan at noon yesterday and left a letter of farewell to all circles of people in Shanghai, which is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Letter of Farewell from the 20th Army Football Team to All Circles of People in Shanghai</p>
<p>We, with our immature athletic skills, boldly came to Shanghai this time to meet people from all walks of life and fellow sports enthusiasts. We are especially grateful for the care and encouragement from all sectors of society, including guidance in language and writing, refreshments during our breaks, and commemorative gifts such as cups, shields, flags, and books. We are extremely grateful and also extremely ashamed for this honor.</p>
<p>We have been away from Sichuan for a long time and have repeatedly been ordered to return. Therefore, we cannot have long-term consultations and exchanges with you. We are leaving Shanghai in a hurry and have not been able to say goodbye to everyone individually, which makes us feel very uneasy. We would like to take this opportunity to say goodbye and express our gratitude to everyone in a sincere manner.</p>
<p>In addition to saying goodbye and expressing our gratitude, we have a few more requests and hopes for everyone, especially for fellow sports enthusiasts and friends in the press.</p>
<p>The immaturity and underdevelopment of sports in our country are undeniable. Shanghai is the only major port in our country and the source of civilization. Sports is no exception. We hope that you, with your qualifications as "early adopters" and a firm commitment to the enthusiasm and spirit of "enlightening those who are slow to awaken," will promote sports throughout the country and create a national atmosphere of sports.</p>
<p>Nanjing held a national sports conference this time and decided on many sports programs. However, to realize these programs, it may still require the supervision and assistance of the majority of people. We first hope that you will shoulder the responsibility of this supervision and assistance so that the government can implement the design of each program as soon as possible, and the people of the whole country can get the opportunity to exercise as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our country is considered to have signed up for the World Games for the first time this year. If we turn over the records of the past Far Eastern Games, what are our country's achievements? "The past is gone." We should make efforts to "gather the gleanings of the evening." This effort should naturally be made by all sports enthusiasts in the country. However, comrades in Shanghai, who are advanced in sports, should "go one step further" to compete for power and glory in the next World Games and Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>Sichuan is located in the remote western frontier, and postal services are still inconvenient. We seem to be far away from you in terms of situation, but our spirits and voices can still communicate. We hope that you will not abandon us because of our remoteness in the future, guide us at any time, and unite to work together on the bright road of sports.</p>
<p>Now we bid farewell to you all. We wish you good health. Furthermore, we were deeply loved by the sports comrades in Shanghai this time. Many groups invited us to compete, but we were unable to comply due to the shortness of time and fatigue. We are extremely sorry. In addition to replying separately, we would like to express our apologies here and ask for your forgiveness.</p>
<h3>St. John's Launches Inter-College Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>Raising Funds to Aid the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The basketball teams of various colleges of St. John's University in this city, in view of the urgent need for relief for the Northeast Volunteer Army, have launched a triangular league. Participants include the University's College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Medicine, and the Affiliated Middle School. The games will be held in the basketball court of the University's Fellowship Hall at 8:00 p.m. this Friday (29th), next Monday (October 2nd), and next Wednesday (4th). Veterans such as Chen Xianglong, Hou Xuemin, Diao You, Zang Jingxing, Wu Youliang, and Ling Huiyang will all be present. Since winning the championship in the confrontation with the Shanghai Jiangwan High School basketball team in the first half of the year, the basketball skills of the University's Affiliated Middle School basketball team have improved even more and will provide a strong resistance to the university team. Tickets are 40 cents each, and all proceeds will be donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army. All accounts will be audited by Zhao Shaoding, an economics professor and accountant at the university. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, raise large sums of money, and help the Northeast Volunteer Army, which is fighting bloody battles thousands of miles away for the country. It is also reported that the three teams will organize a mixed team and are willing to compete with famous teams in Shanghai. I think that the athletes and patriots of Shanghai will not let the St. John's team feel lonely.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Basketball Rules for 1932-1933 (1)</h3>
<p>(Announced by the National Sports Association)</p>
<p>Article 3 of the first chapter adds a midline clause for the "ten-second rule." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>A circle with a radius of three feet should be drawn in the center of the court, called the "center circle." Draw a diameter line parallel to the end line in the circle, and extend the diameter line left and right to intersect with the two sidelines, called the "midline." The line is two inches wide. This line does not apply to courts with a length of less than 60 feet.</p>
<p>Article 6 of Chapter 5 Each jersey must have the same number on the front and back for easy identification. The full text is changed as follows:</p>
<p>Each player should have two identical numbers, sewn on the front and back of the vest. The numbers should be at least six inches high and made of one-inch wide material. Players on the same team must not use the same number.</p>
<p>Article 3 of Chapter 7 Last year, a note related to the jump ball was added. Now, due to the ten-second restriction in the backcourt, this note is cancelled. However, if a player in the backcourt is guarded by the opponent and cannot take any action for more than five seconds, the referee or inspector may still declare a jump ball. However, since there is a ten-second rule, such situations are not easy to find in fact.</p>
<p>Article 12 of Chapter 7 The definition of "obstruction" has undergone important changes. A new note is painted after the article. The original name "obstruction" should be changed to "blocking." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Using physical contact to block an opponent who is not holding the ball is called "blocking."</p>
<p>(Note) Since blocking is an intrusion foul, there is no such thing as a "legitimate obstruction" action in meaning.</p>
<p>The legitimate action to prevent an opponent from intruding is called "screening."</p>
<p>Article 13 of Chapter 7 A new definition of "face defense" is added as follows: A player who disregards the direction of the ball, faces and follows the movement of the opponent player, and hinders his progress is called "face defense."</p>
<p>Article 14 of Chapter 7 Merge the old rules 13, 14, and 15 into one. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>A violation of the rules is called a "foul." The violator shall be subject to one or more free throws. The types of technical fouls and intrusion fouls are listed separately in Sections A and B of Chapter 15.</p>
<p>Article 22 of Chapter 7 Explains the definitions of frontcourt and backcourt as follows:</p>
<p>The half-court where the team's basket is located is the team's frontcourt, and the other court is the backcourt.</p>
<p>Article 8 of Chapter 8 The most important change in the rules is that, due to the influence of the new style of play, the speed of the game is gradually slowing down, so this article is specifically restricted in order to restore the original speed and spirit of the game. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) After a team gets the ball in its backcourt, if the ball has not been touched by the opposing player, or if it has been touched, the team shall pass the ball across the midline within ten seconds. If the ball is touched by the opposing player or is touched and the ball is still in the backcourt, the ten-second rule starts again.</p>
<p>After a team has passed the ball to the frontcourt, it shall not return the ball to the backcourt except in the following four exceptions: (1) Those who have shot over the basket; (2) Those who have jumped the ball through the center circle or elsewhere; (3) Those who have gone out of bounds; (4) The ball has been taken away by the opponent and then obtained again.</p>
<p>(B) After the team gets the ball in the frontcourt in the above four cases, the ball is only allowed to be returned to the midline once.</p>
<h3>New Basketball Techniques (2) (Not to be reproduced)</h3>
<p>Original by Claire Burcky</p>
<p>Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>The basketball game was once a confined style, with the field surrounded by a rope net, usually with four walls. Initially, there were seven players in a team, then it was changed to nine, then eight, and now the number of players on the court has been changed to five. The game time has also been changed from three periods per game to two halves.</p>
<p>There is no standard regulation for the size of the court. Generally, for children, it is 40 feet wide. The basketball court for middle school students is 48 feet wide and 75 feet long. The largest standard basketball court must not exceed 50 feet wide and 98 feet long, and the smallest must not be less than 35 feet wide and 60 feet long.</p>
<p>In terms of technical terms, the longer sides of the field are the sidelines, and the shorter sides are the baselines. The entire game must be played within this boundary. The purpose of this game, of course, is to make the ball pass through the basket in the opponent's area as much as possible. (Correction) There was a numerical error in the third sentence at the end of yesterday's article. The corrected version is as follows: "Although this game has undergone many changes in the past 41 years."</p>
<p>The top picture is of an old-style basketball court. The bottom picture is of a new-style basketball court.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Flew to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Transfer to Xun to Attend the Lushan Conference</p>
<p>Plans to Visit Beiping After Meeting with Chiang</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, flew back to Beijing in his own Sikorsky plane at around 11 a.m. yesterday, as he will be going to Lushan in the coming days to attend an important conference convened by Chairman Chiang. He will stay in Beijing for about three days before going to Lushan. Those who accompanied Song yesterday included Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donald Representative Li Yunchao, Ministry of Finance Counselor Shen Qing, Secretary Huang Chun Dao, and three guards. It is reported that after Song arrives in Beijing, Chairman Lin and the US Consul in Beijing, Fick, may travel to Xun together. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai At about 10 a.m. yesterday, Song was ready to go. At the same time, Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donald, and Representative Li Yunchao, who had agreed to travel with him, also arrived at Song's residence. At 10:30, Song and Donald and his wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, took a car to Hongqiao Airport. At 10:55, they departed for Beijing in their own Sikorsky plane. Song's wife, Zhang Leyi, only sent him to the plane and returned. In addition, those who saw him off included Yang Xingfo and Mao Bangchu, vice presidents of the Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>Song's Remarks The reporter met with Song at his residence yesterday morning. According to Song, "I (Song Ziwen referring to himself) will return to Beijing first today and stay in Beijing for about two or three days before going to Lushan. As for the news reported today that I ordered the suspension of payment of Japanese Boxer Indemnity next month, it is completely inaccurate. Although Japan has repeatedly been aggressive and disregards international integrity, our country must be patient to maintain our position on Japan as a blank sheet of paper, without anything that can be used as an excuse by Japan. At the same time, it will make Japan's arrogance and rampage even more apparent to the world."</p>
<p>Going to Beiping It is heard that the purpose of this trip by Song and others is related to internal affairs issues. After arriving in Beijing, in addition to reporting to the central government on his trip to Hangzhou, he will also go to Lushan with He Yingqin and others to attend the conference. It is said that after Song and others meet with Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan, they also plan to travel to Beiping with Donald and Li Yunchao for a meeting with Zhang Xueliang and others.</p>
<p>Chiang Did Not Invite Sun According to Zheng Hongnian, who is close to Sun Zhesheng, yesterday, the mission of Song and others' trip to Xun is still unknown. The rumor that Chiang telegraphed Sun to invite him to Lushan for a meeting is completely untrue. Sun has not received a telegram from Chiang and has no intention of leaving Shanghai recently. As for taking over the presidency of the Executive Yuan, no one in Hong Kong or Shanghai has contacted him. As for taking over the presidency of the Legislative Yuan, it is even more untrue. However, according to observations from Sun's entourage, the rumor that Sun will be the president of the Executive Yuan may be Zhang Xueliang's idea.</p>
<h3>The Pseudo-Organization Goes Back on Its Word</h3>
<p>National Vessels Can Still Navigate</p>
<p>After the pseudo-organization began collecting ship taxes and customs duties on September 25, Chinese and foreign commercial vessels in Shanghai initially worried that they would not be able to navigate to various ports in the Northeast because no agreements had been signed. The national vessel side even planned to open new routes to maintain business. Unexpectedly, news came that the pseudo-state still allows Chinese and foreign commercial vessels to travel to the Northeast. The details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Excuses for Opening Up The pseudo-state has also arbitrarily defined the names of countries with and without agreements. After September 25, vessels of countries without agreements cannot travel to AnDong, Yingkou, Dalian, and other ports in the Northeast. However, considering that once a ban is implemented, it will inevitably hinder its tax revenue, a group of traitors decided to make excuses to open the door. Commercial vessels of countries without agreements can still operate as usual and are not restricted by any treaty. They can still freely enter and exit various ports.</p>
<p>Collection of Tonnage Taxes From the 26th, ships going to the Northeast must pay tonnage taxes. According to the tonnage tax collected by the Chinese Customs, based on the registered tonnage, each ton is charged three cents of silver per quarter. After paying the tonnage tax, the vessel can travel to all ports in the country for a period of three months. Now, the pseudo-state is taking a free navigation approach, and tonnage taxes are calculated each time. It is stipulated that ships within 5,000 tons pay about 40 yuan each time they travel to the Northeast. If they travel again next time, they must pay the tonnage tax again. This method has been notified to the various shipping companies.</p>
<p>Utilizing Chinese Vessels Products from the Northeast, such as soybeans, miscellaneous grains, and oil, are most popular in the central and southern parts of the mainland. Once Chinese and foreign ships are banned, if all of the soybeans, soybean cakes, miscellaneous grains, and oil are loaded on Japanese ships, it will inevitably be refused everywhere during this time of intense resistance. It will cause the export of goods to be fundamentally trapped and unable to be shipped out. The pseudo-state authorities are using Chinese vessels to load the goods. Therefore, the vessels of Zhengji, Zhaoxing, Yuda, Haichang, Datong, and other companies are still ordered to operate as before, but they are subject to banknote taxes.</p>
<p>National Vessels Going to Yingkou The various Chinese shipping bureaus have received telegrams from Yingkou stating that they can operate. The Haishun vessel of the Haichang Company in this port is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to the Northeast today. However, all export goods loaded on the vessel and transported to Yingkou will be subject to full taxes in accordance with the new regulations. It is said that this vessel is the first Chinese merchant ship to depart from Shanghai for the Northeast. The Zhengji, Zhaoxing, Yuda, and other companies are also dispatching their vessels.</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest in the Western Suburbs of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Net Rice Yield of More Than 400 Jin Per Mu</p>
<p>According to farmers in the western suburbs of Shanghai yesterday, the crops in the farmland this year were quite abundant due to the hot summer. The planted rice and cotton were both quite smooth. Recently, the early rice has been harvested, and the harvest is generally more than 400 jin of net rice per mu, which is unprecedented in the past ten years. The cotton, also because it is currently in the process of budding in the past few days, has been smoothly released due to the sunny weather, and is extremely lush. If the weather is good, the harvest will be very promising. Therefore, the farmers in the villages are all happy.</p>
<h3>Extraterritorial Road Construction</h3>
<p>Installation of Telephone Issues</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Announced Negotiations With the Telephone Company</p>
<p>The Telephone Company Signed a Draft Agreement and Then Went Back on Its Word</p>
<p>Claiming That the Concession Public Works Bureau Disagreed</p>
<p>Regarding the installation of telephones in the extraterritorial road construction section of this city, the Municipal Public Works Bureau announced the negotiations with the concession telephone company yesterday. The telephones in this city are operated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, with the entire city as the business area. The telephone company in the concession installs telephones in the extraterritorial road construction section of western Shanghai and northern Shanghai, based on the annexes to the telephone contract signed between the bureau and the former Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company. This contract was signed on December 17th of the Republic of China, stipulating a term of five years. After the Shanghai Telephone Company received the sale of the former Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company in August of the 19th year of the Republic of China, it did not express any opinion on the contract, which was about to expire. This contract expired on December 16th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, and the annexes also expired. Since the basis was lost, the company naturally cannot install telephones in the extraterritorial road construction section after this, and in theory, all of its original poles, wires, and equipment should also be dismantled. However, the residents in this section are in great need of telephones, and it is impossible not to take into account the facts before the lines of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications have been reached. Under appropriate conditions, a proper solution is sought. Although the telephones in this city are operated by the Ministry of Communications, the Municipal Government should do its best to assist in order to seek convenience for Chinese and foreign residents. Therefore, on the day after the expiration of the above-mentioned telephone contract, that is, December 17th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Public Works Bureau invited the director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company to the bureau for consultations, and orally suggested signing a temporary contract for a period of one year. Within this period, long-term solutions should be negotiated so that the residents who have installed telephones will not be interrupted, and those who have not installed them can also add them. After several consultations, in order to seek a quick solution, the Public Works Bureau drafted a draft agreement. On May 22nd of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company were invited to the bureau to discuss it. Since then, formal meetings and informal contacts have been held no less than 20 times. During this period, there have been various twists and turns. Finally, on October 23rd of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Public Works Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the Shanghai Telephone Company signed the draft agreement, stating that the formal contract could be signed soon. However, unexpectedly, after more than a month of delay, the company refused to indicate when the formal contract could be signed. After repeated urging from the Public Works Bureau, it replied on December 21st of the 20th year of the Republic of China that the agreed contract could not be formally signed because it had not been approved by the Public Works Bureau. It also put forward some points that needed to be revised and requested a new discussion. It was believed that since the draft agreement had been signed, credibility was involved and there should be no changes. Moreover, when discussing the terms, the company also stated that it had frequent contact with the Public Works Bureau. Why did it suddenly claim that it had not obtained the consent of the Public Works Bureau after the draft agreement was signed? However, the Public Works Bureau pretended to seek convenience for the citizens and still lowered its heart to follow and seek a compromise. It carefully considered the points raised for revision with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. Except for the points that were considered difficult to accept, the rest were agreed upon and the company was sent a letter on January 21st of this year, asking it to make a clear reply. However, since receiving the company's reply on January 28th, stating that it had forwarded the matter to the Public Works Bureau for consideration, more than half a year has passed without any news. It is clear to see where the responsibility lies for the failure of this matter and the inability of the residents to enjoy the convenience of telephones. What is there to argue? The above is the actual situation of the Public Works Bureau's efforts to assist the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Telephone Company in negotiating and signing the contract, and the company's delay in signing the formal contract after the draft agreement was signed. The reason why the Public Works Bureau is seeking a compromise and hopes that the contract will be signed is nothing more than for the convenience of the citizens. However, the company has repeatedly reversed itself and caused many twists and turns when discussing the terms, and after the draft agreement was signed, it made excuses to delay and refused to formally sign the contract. Since the company has no intention of signing the contract, the Public Works Bureau cannot force it. The extraterritorial road construction section is the exclusive operating area of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The company originally installed telephones in this section based on the telephone contract signed by both parties as a legal basis. Now that the old contract has long expired, the company has no intention of signing a new contract, which means that it has no intention of obtaining a legal basis. Since it does not want to obtain a legal basis, but still allows it to arbitrarily install telephones within the exclusive operating area of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, is there such a reason? Moreover, there is no other way to find a replacement. Now, the residents in this area are greatly inconvenienced because they cannot install telephones, which is well known to the Public Works Bureau, but there is nothing it can do. The case has been pending for more than a year, and outsiders are unclear about the truth and cannot help but have doubts. Therefore, the true situation of this matter is announced in summary to clarify the truth and responsibility.</p>
<h3>General Meeting of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association</h3>
<p>Important Report from Northeast Representatives</p>
<p>Expand Fundraising for the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association held its third membership meeting yesterday at 4 PM at the China Society. Over eighty people attended, including Chu Huiseng, Xu Mengyan, Wang Zhisheng, Yin Zhufu, Luo Yinpu, Mu Ouchu, Chen Yafu, Hu Fengxiang, Shen Junru, Zhang Juansheng, Yu Xiji, Zhu Ziqiao (representing Zhang Peinian), Zhang Peinian, Yin Zhiling, Shen Zuru, Zheng Jie, Pan Xulun, Lin Shiyan, Hu Zusun, Wang Xiaolai, Li Cishan, Wu Shan, Tan Bozhi, Liu Shixiong, Wei Bozheng, Lin Kanghou, Wen Zongyao, Ren Jinpin, Huang Jingwan, Zhao Hengti, Zhang Shenzhi, and Gu Wuwo. Chu Huiseng was publicly elected as chairman, and Yang Youren as recorder.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: The chairman first reported on the association's affairs. Yu Xiji reported on the accounting records. Pan Xulun reported on the supervisory committee's plan to close the accounts by the end of September. Next, the compilation of the first credit list was discussed. Zhang Peinian, Liu Piguang, and Tian Xiuqiao reported on the situation in the Northeast. Subsequently, resolutions were discussed and passed, and additional directors were elected. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>Zhang Xi's Report: Zhu Ziqiao, representing Zhang Peinian, reported that since the September 18th Incident, people from the Northeast had invariably contacted Zhu first. This was because Zhu had served as an official in the three northeastern provinces for many years and had many talented people under his command. Whenever Zhu heard about the dire situation in the Northeast, he would frown and beat his chest in anguish, feeling deeply distressed. Therefore, he quietly departed on August 18th. The reason for his discreet departure was twofold: first, he had previously been involved in flood relief work and had some connections with the national government; second, rescuing the people from hardship was a duty imposed by heaven, and saving the lost province was particularly important. Therefore, he did not seek fame but focused on practical matters. Since Zhu's departure, the Volunteer Army's momentum had greatly increased, with a surge in activity and a tenfold increase in morale, which was a cause for comfort. In total, he commands approximately 300,000 people or more, and efforts should be made to provide them with a large supply of winter clothing.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Jilin: Liu Piguang, a representative from Jilin, reported on the recent situation in Jilin, stating that: (1) Li Du and Ding Chao controlled all twelve counties east of the Chinese Eastern Railway, including Hailin, with a force of approximately 40,000 men; (2) Wang Delin had 30,000 to 40,000 men in Yan, Hun, and Ning'an; (3) Feng Zhanhai had 30,000 to 40,000 men in Yushu. Out of the 42 counties in Jilin Province, the Volunteer Army controlled 24. The twelve counties east of the Chinese Eastern Railway were united, while the rest were separated by the Japanese army into three zones. The current objectives are: 1. [Missing text], 2. [Missing text], 3. [Missing text]. Other areas, such as Yilan, Fujin, and Yimianpo, are also being contacted. Regarding the recent situation in the Jilin battles, Feng Zhanhai and Wang Delin attacked the provincial capital on September 6th, causing great panic among the Japanese. By the 13th, they had captured the provincial capital, and Xi Qia had fled. When the Japanese army retreated, they set fire to the city, resulting in a very tragic situation. After Feng's army entered the city, Wang's army also came from the east between Jilin and Changchun, occupying important locations along the Jilin-Changchun Railway. Based on the current situation, [Missing text] has a chance of being recovered. The major battle in the future will also be in the [Missing text] area. Yang Yaojun's troops are actively advancing, and Gong Changhai is also assisting in the attack. Li Ding is now preparing to retake [Missing text], which can gain [Missing text] advantage, while also contacting [Missing text] troops. Currently, Ma Xianzhang and Xing Haiqing's two brigades have been dispatched to actively attack. Regarding supplies, Li and Du have repeatedly sent telegrams urging for assistance. Currently, military food can still be procured locally, but military clothing is impossible to obtain. Jilin's commerce has completely come to a standstill, and after the floods in northern Manchuria, the people's livelihood is even more dire, and the economy is even more difficult. The military uniforms for the spring and summer were made by repeatedly altering winter clothing. Now that the weather is turning from cool to cold, it is impossible to withstand the severe cold.</p>
<p>Representative Ma Kui: Tian Jiqiao, representing Ma Kui, son of Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province, reported that Chairman Ma is fighting hard against the Japanese, and thanks to the enthusiastic donations from all sectors of Shanghai, and this time again with the allocated funds, he would like to express his gratitude on behalf of Chairman Ma. Chairman Ma still controls fourteen counties, while the Japanese only occupy one-fifth of the province, an area of only 3,000 square li, but these are all wealthy areas, while the areas under our army's control are all barren and have been destroyed by the Japanese army. The hardship has reached its extreme. In early September, Chairman Ma led ten armies and one regiment, intending to discuss military strategies with Generals Ding and Li, but on the way through Qingcheng, they suddenly encountered fourteen Japanese aircraft, resulting in almost the entire army being wiped out. Many, including the chief of staff, Han Shupeng, and Secretary Sun, were also killed in action. Chairman Ma himself was wounded in two places, but fortunately, he has now recovered. He is currently under Japanese blockade, and both food and clothing are in short supply. Even the local people are in danger of freezing and starving. Without assistance, they may freeze and starve to death.</p>
<p>Discussion of Resolutions: (1) Regarding the proposal that the association's future handling of Volunteer Army supplies should be the responsibility of the highest directly affiliated general organization or anti-Japanese organizations with direct connections for application, it was resolved to be handled by the board of directors. (2) After Article 12 of the association's constitution, add a new article: "The association's operating expenses shall not use donations from the Volunteer Army, but shall be funded from the following sources: 1. Membership fees (at least 30 yuan per person), 2. Special donations, 3. Various income designated for fundraising." (3) Regarding the proposal to abolish the existing "Social Affairs" group in Article 9 of the association's constitution and establish a "Liaison" group to oversee the Volunteer Army's supply matters, it was resolved to be approved. (4) Regarding whether additional directors should be elected to fill the vacancies on the association's board of directors, it was publicly decided to elect eight additional directors to reach the full number of forty-five. (5) Regarding the proposal to expand fundraising, it was publicly decided to adopt the original plan of thirteen articles as follows: (1) Issue lottery tickets to support the Northeast Volunteer Army, (2) Organize fundraising teams to solicit donations on the ground, (3) Set up donation boxes in teahouses, restaurants, hotels, cinemas, amusement parks, major stores, and transportation agencies, and ask them to collect donations on behalf of the association, (4) Contact women's groups to sell flowers for fundraising, (5) Request factories to supply goods to be sold in temporary department stores set up by the association, with the capital returned and the profits donated, (6) Request wealthy individuals to donate, (7) Request companies, stores, and firms to collect donations themselves, (8) Ask amusement parks to increase the price of admission tickets and donate the increase, (9) Ask various industries to increase the price of goods and donate, (10) Ask artists to donate calligraphy and paintings to be sold at exhibitions for fundraising, (11) Sell the collected literary and artistic works, (12) Ask enthusiastic individuals to initiate the organization of 16-yuan groups, with 16 yuan as one unit, (13) Solicit donations from overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Additional Directors Elected: Eight additional directors were elected by secret ballot as follows: Mu Ouchu, Qian Xinzhi, Zhao Hengti, Du Chongyuan, Wei Bozheng, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhicai, and Ren Jinpin.</p>
<h3>Councilor Jiang of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Ma Zhanshan's Ordeal</h3>
<p>Bullet Wound to Both Jaws Fully Healed</p>
<p>Rumors of Head Injury Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Still Directing Advance from Somewhere</p>
<p>High Morale, Bloody Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, Councilor Jiang of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday after overcoming numerous hardships from the military camp of Chairman Ma in Heilongjiang Province. Yesterday, the Daily News reporter met with Mr. Jiang, who recounted the ordeal of General Ma Zhanshan. It differed greatly from what had been heard from the outside. The following is a record of Mr. Jiang's conversation: When Chairman Ma previously retreated to Hailun, the Japanese army learned of it in advance and used many planes to track and pursue him, dropping bombs in a very dangerous situation. At that time, Chairman Ma was in a temple, and the Japanese planes targeted this temple, dropping countless bombs, none of which exploded, which was truly fortunate. Recently, the military progress at the front has been very rapid. When advancing to Badaogou, Chairman Ma personally braved the enemy's fire and took the lead. Unexpectedly, he was once again targeted by Japanese planes. Chairman Ma took refuge in a civilian residence, surviving on coarse grain. The Japanese planes still knew Chairman Ma's whereabouts and dropped bombs again, causing Chairman Ma to be hit in the cheeks by shrapnel at this time. Both sides of the upper jaw were injured, but not severely. The rumors of a head injury are unconfirmed. After medical treatment, he has now fully recovered and is still directing the army's advance from somewhere. However, because we have no planes to counter them, the troops are all hiding in the forests to avoid being targeted by Japanese planes, resisting with blood and courage, and the morale is high. From now on, we eagerly hope that all parties will provide strong support so that the lost territories in the Northeast can be recovered as soon as possible, and that revenge can be taken. It all depends on this matter.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Disaster Victims from the Four Northeastern Provinces Arrive in Shanghai to Seek Relief</h3>
<p>Representative Yang Zigong Reports on the Extreme Severity of the Floods in Jilin and Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Various Charity Groups Raise Large Sums to Manufacture Cotton Clothing in Advance</p>
<p>When the Joint Association of Charity Groups in this city to Relief Disaster Victims in the Northeast held a meeting yesterday, Mr. Yang Zigong, a representative of disaster victims from the four northeastern provinces, happened to arrive in Shanghai after being introduced by various charity groups in Beiping via prior letters and telegrams seeking relief. He was allowed to attend the meeting and report on the suffering of the people in the Northeast. According to him, the disaster of the floods in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces was truly unprecedented. Along the Songhua River, Mudan River, Nen River, and Qingting River, more than thirty counties were submerged in a vast ocean, with no land visible. In Harbin alone, the water depth outside the city reached fourteen or fifteen feet, and over 300,000 disaster victims were gathered. The climate in Jilin and Heilongjiang is the coldest in our country, and it is already severely cold there now, requiring fur clothing. In addition, they were suddenly struck by a major flood, and all their clothing and belongings were washed away. They are now in urgent need of rescue. The most urgently needed item is warm winter cotton-padded clothing. Otherwise, the disaster victims will be groaning in the icy and snowy land, and even if they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death first. Currently, there is an endless stream of representatives of disaster victims from the Northeast entering the pass to Beiping seeking relief, all crying and wailing in grief. I was publicly recommended by various charity groups to come to Shanghai to report and seek relief, but I still cannot fully express the tragic situation of the people in the Northeast. I earnestly beg for prompt rescue, or there will be no survivors. All the representatives attending the meeting were moved by Mr. Yang's report. After discussion, it was decided to proceed purely with a charitable and compassionate nature, and to carry out urgent relief in the most severely flooded areas of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces with a charitable approach. Personnel will be dispatched to carry out emergency relief. The nine charity groups present at the meeting initially pledged 300,000 yuan in relief funds and immediately planned to advance half of the amount, 150,000 yuan, to purchase cotton clothing in Harbin, and 150,000 yuan in cash was prepared to be distributed in the disaster areas based on a list of names. Mr. Yang immediately telegraphed various charity groups in Beiping to make contact. This is truly good news for the flood victims in Jilin and Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that the Joint Association of Charity Groups in this city to Relief Disaster Victims in the Northeast held a standing committee meeting yesterday. As the disasters in the Northeast continue and the people are suffering from cold and starvation, and the weather is getting colder, cotton clothing should be distributed as soon as possible. Therefore, nine groups have joined together to raise 150,000 yuan in relief funds specifically for the purchase of cotton clothing. Letters have already been sent to the Chinese Red Cross Society and the World Red Cross Society, requesting them to inquire by telegram to the Harbin branch about the local purchase of new cotton clothing, and how much money is needed per set of clothing, so that the money can be remitted for entrusted manufacturing.</p>
<h3>Guan Haishan and Zhang Xiyu Telegraph to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Guan Haishan and Zhang Xiyu, Commanders of the First Brigade of the 55th Route of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, telegraphed urgently: To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, various ministries, provincial and municipal governments, people's organizations, and newspapers: Our country is unfortunately plagued by frequent disasters. The island nation of Japan is taking advantage of our crisis, driving ugly forces to invade and occupy our three provinces, causing disaster in Shanghai and Tianjin, harming our sovereignty, and killing our people. Recently, they have increased their troops in Yuyu and Rehe, and their intention is to destroy our North China. Such an inhumane enemy is truly intolerable to mankind. If we continue to allow them to be tyrannical, not only will peace in East Asia be hopeless, but the world's powers will also have no peace of mind. For the sake of world peace and the safety of our Chinese nation, we must use the blood of our nation to recover our northeastern territories. Haishan and Xiyu belong to the people of the country and are determined to fight against the enemy for the country. How dare we lag behind? We respectfully lead our thousands of brave soldiers as vanguards for the country, determined that China and Japan cannot coexist, and that we and the enemy cannot both survive. We will never allow our Chinese people to be slaughtered by the wooden-clog-wearing dwarves. We respectfully ask for your consideration. Guan Haishan and Zhang Xiyu, at the military camp of Panling, kowtow and stamp.</p>
<h3>National Postal Workers' Union Schedules Memorial Service for Postal Workers Martyred in Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Shanghai on October 16th</p>
<p>Lu Chunhua, Chen Zude, and Pan Jiaji, postal workers from all over the country (Shanghai), died in action after joining the Shanghai Battle Zone Rescue Team. Chen Fangxiang and Su Pincai (Shanghai) were killed by Japanese soldiers on their way to the post office on official business. Fu Xiude (Shanghai) was captured and killed by Japanese soldiers in the war zone. Yang Jiachen, director of the Emu Post Office in the three northeastern provinces, was arrested and killed by Japanese soldiers in the post office. The National Postal Workers' Union, considering that these members sacrificed themselves for the country, originally planned to hold a national memorial service for postal workers martyred in the Anti-Japanese War on October 2nd. However, due to incomplete preparations, it has been decided to reschedule it to October 16th at the Shanghai Juvenile Propaganda Group. It is reported that the union has distributed a public announcement of the conference to postal unions and public organizations across the country, inviting them to send representatives to participate. If you wish to send condolence messages or eulogies, please send them directly to the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union for collection.</p>

<h3>Shandong Guild Hall Telegraphs Jiang and He to Handle the Shandong War</h3>
<p>The Shandong Guild Hall telegraphed military commanders Jiang and He yesterday, saying: Hankou</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Commander Jiang, Nanjing Minister He: The situation in the Northeast is urgent, and the war in eastern Shandong has started again. External troubles and internal worries are extremely painful. Fortunately, we have received your strict order for Han and Liu to stop the war, showing your concern for the people, which is deeply appreciated. However, it is heard that Liu's troops are now concentrated in Muping, Qixia, Laiyang, and Yexian. Whether it is a small area of four counties, it is difficult to bear the burden, and the two armies are still in a tense standoff. If there is no retreat plan and good follow-up measures, there is a danger that a spark will ignite and spread the disaster to the entire province. We dare to appeal to you to quickly provide effective measures to end the internal strife and maintain the people's lives. The people of Shandong will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. The Shandong Guild Hall in Shanghai respectfully thanks you.</p>

<h3>Memorandum on the Sharp Increase in Water Bills in the Shanghai International Settlement</h3>
<p>September 13, 1932</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British company, obtained the approval of the Public Works Department to universally use water meters, the number of meters installed in the Shanghai International Settlement has increased dramatically. In some cases, the increase is nine times the amount calculated based on the standard of rent. Some examples are listed below:</p>
<p>When the Rent Is 100, Water Meter Reading, Water Bill Paid, Water Bill Calculated, Increase Multiple</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association 34.75 79.38 More than double</p>
<p>Yiji Landlord Accounting Office 28.50 230.57 More than eight times</p>
<p>Changtai Company 24.46 21.950 Nearly nine times</p>
<p>Gu Lanji 65.83 (20 days) 238.63 More than five times</p>
<p>Also 35.09 (26 days) 134.00 More than four times</p>
<p>Huada Foreign Firm 43.01 (34 days) 344.25 Seven and a half times</p>
<p>Also 141.00 (20 days) 409.19 More than four times</p>
<p>Also (Need to Check Five (One month and two days) 320.25</p>
<p>Seventeen Buildings' Rent)</p>
<p>Huacheng Tobacco Company 71.50 131.00 Nearly double</p>
<p>Friends of Yongyuan Company 13.20 (29 days) 73.13 Nearly six times</p>
<p>Huaan Insurance Company 72.50 (27 days) 346.75 More than five times</p>
<p>Also 15.54 (27 days) 143.00 Nearly seven times</p>
<p>Qinyu Company 61.85 431.81 More than seven times</p>
<p>Zhenji Landlord Office 15.40 71.88 Nearly five times</p>
<p>Gu Detang 26.35 112.00 Nearly four times</p>
<p>Jingji Company 45.40 (34 days) 191.38 Nearly four times</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, it can be inferred that the smaller the rent, the more poor and hardship-stricken people there must be. If the water bill is added to the tenants, how can these tenants afford it? If the landlord pays, the landlord's actual rental income is less than 40%. For example, for a total rent of 100 yuan, after deducting 6% and adding 1.5% surcharge, the net rent is 92.5 yuan. Now, with a water bill of 70 yuan, only 30 yuan is left for rent. How can the costs of official interest, land tax, depreciation, insurance, and repairs be allocated? Therefore, this association suggests to the public and the municipal authorities: (1) Maintain the standard of rent as the basis for calculating water bills, as the surcharge added is already sufficient to cover the water company's expenses; or (2) If water meters must be used to calculate water bills, then (A) it should be ensured that the burden on the poor and hardship-stricken people is not increased, and (B) the water company should install water meters in every household to test and estimate the cost, and then uniformly use water meters to calculate water bills, setting three or two levels of water prices according to the amount of rent. However, users should pay the water bills directly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Retains Huang Naishu Again</h3>
<p>Huang Naishu, Director-General of the National Postal Administration, telegraphed the Ministry of Communications from Shanghai to Hangzhou to request approval of his resignation. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency in Beijing visited Yu Feipeng, Vice Minister of Communications. According to him, Huang has submitted his resignation three times, and the Ministry of Communications has previously approved orders to retain him. This time, his resignation only mentioned difficulties. However, since the Northeast postal service was blockaded, the income of the Postal Administration has decreased, while 2,400 employees have entered the customs, and it is quite difficult to arrange positions for them. In fact, it is impossible to make so many patriotic employees feel unemployed suddenly. This situation, on the one hand, feels the impact of the postal economy, and on the other hand, feels the urgency of solving the livelihood of employees entering the customs. This is the entire problem of the postal service. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications will still retain Huang's remarks and hope that he will not give up and seek the development of the postal economy again. It is believed that as long as the bandit areas are cleared and the society is stable, the way to make up for it may not be very difficult. If Huang is indeed not fully recovered from his illness, he may be temporarily allowed to take a short leave of absence. Once Minister Huang returns to Beijing today or tomorrow, after reviewing Huang's resignation, he will immediately approve an order to retain him and urge him to take a leave of absence and return to work as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Silk Factory Scheduled to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>The silk factory workers in this city went on strike on the 23rd to protest against the capitalists' breach of contract, extension of working hours, and demand for improved treatment. After the party and government agencies made every effort to mediate, the situation has eased. The seven factories in the concession area, such as Xiangxiang, resumed work on the morning of the 26th. The twelve factories in the Hongkou area, such as Yichang, except for the Renji Factory on Deswe Road and the Gongyi Factory on Tianbao Road, which suffered heavy damage to their machinery during the labor dispute and are still under repair, the remaining factories have all been scheduled to resume production today and have made preparations yesterday. However, according to Zang Xingen, director of the Fourth District Silk Labor Union, the women's side, after mediation by the Social Bureau, was originally scheduled to hold direct labor-capital negotiations at the Silk Factory Association at 3:00 pm yesterday (the 27th) to discuss the various conditions proposed by the workers. However, the capitalists' representatives were absent, so no agreement was reached. Before the treatment problem has been improved, the person dare not anticipate whether there will be other problems when the workers resume work. As for the labor dispute at the Fulun Shuanggong Factory on Tianbao Road, the factory owner, Shen Zupei, has agreed to reinstate all ten female workers who were suspended and is willing to appropriately increase wages according to the treatment methods of the single-loom silk factory. It has also been scheduled to start work this morning. It is expected that there will be no other problems when the female workers of the factory resume work.</p>

<h3>U.S. Consul General Requests Preservation of General Ward's Cemetery</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Cunningham, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, wanted to preserve the cemetery of General Ward in Songjiang. He sent an official letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating that General Ward was buried in Songjiang. Every year, American expatriates in Shanghai visit the cemetery in Songjiang once to pay their respects. However, in recent years, Songjiang has been actively carrying out construction projects, and public land is often used for public buildings. A lot of vacant land around General Ward's cemetery has already been sold. Therefore, he specially wrote to request that the Songjiang County Government be instructed to leave ten acres of land around General Ward's cemetery as public property for permanent preservation, so as to avoid the cemetery being submerged and difficult to find in the future.</p>
<h3>French Inspector General Strictly Investigates "No. 11"</h3>
<p>Eradicating the Harm of Red Pills is Urgent</p>
<p>Mr. Fevrier, the Commissioner of Police of the French Concession, recently found that the red pills were rampant in the concession. Although the police have repeatedly cracked down on them, the number of criminals arrested for smoking red pills has increased every day. Mr. Fevrier believes that if this kind of poison is not completely eradicated, the future harm will be unimaginable. The only way to eradicate it is to start with the major production organizations. He ordered all police stations to pay close attention and eradicate them completely in the shortest possible time. Yesterday, according to confidential reports, it was found that the red pills were labeled "No. 11," and the boss was a Ningbo native named Lu Changfa. Because the first manufacturing organization was numbered 11, the red pills got their name from it. After receiving the report, Mr. Fevrier ordered the relevant police stations to investigate and arrest them strictly.</p>
<h3>Principal Culprit in Red Pill Den Interrogated</h3>
<p>Guilty of Both Fraud and Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>Customers Escape, Accomplices Arrested</p>
<p>Zhang Fengming, a Tianjin rogue living at No. 2, Chundeli, Lanweiai Road, French Concession, also known as Zhang Fuming, also known as Xiao Zhang, colluded with Zhang Agui, a Jiangbei native who was a retired chauffeur for Zhuang Chunfu, a compradore of the Aili Foreign Firm at No. 20, Guangyuli, Gale Road, and more than ten accomplices. On the morning of August 30, at 8:00 a.m., they impersonated police detectives and went to Zhuang Chunfu's home on the pretext of investigating Japanese goods. They went to the upstairs room and searched everywhere, but there were no signs of Japanese goods. At that time, Mr. and Mrs. Zhuang were still asleep and were awakened by the disturbance. Zhang and others intimidated them and demanded 100 yuan, otherwise they would be taken to the police station for investigation. Mr. and Mrs. Zhuang were guarded and lost their freedom. They had no choice but to give 20 yuan before they left. Afterwards, Zhuang reported to the police station based on information and requested an investigation. Detectives were sent to arrest them, but Zhang and others had already fled. Now, Xu Fuqing, the chief detective of the Central Police Station, and Zeng Juru and Zhou Ruiyuan, deputy detectives, and Liu Jinrong, a detective, found that Zhang had privately set up a red pill den on the third floor of his home, providing people with lighting to smoke, which violated the ban. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, they rushed to arrest them. The customers heard the sound of knocking on the door and escaped through the window. The detectives entered and arrested Zhang and his partner, Ye Yukang. Only Miao Fengchun was left, unable to escape and was arrested. In the mechanism under the stairs, they found ten red pill guns, four lamps, 270 red pills, 14 jiao of small silver sold, and 40 copper coins, and took them all to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, it was found that Zhuang Chunfu's family had been defrauded, and Zhang had a previous criminal record and had been punished. Yesterday, Gu Shouxi, the lawyer of the police station, explained the case to the Second Special Court's Criminal Court II, and charged him with impersonating a public official to intimidate and extort money under Article 370 of the Criminal Law, and Articles 10 and 11 of the Opium Prohibition Act. The plaintiff, Zhuang Chunfu, was represented by his wife, who stated the circumstances of the fraud. Zhang denied impersonating a detective to extort money, and said that the opium paraphernalia belonged to his tenant, Ye Yukang. Ye confessed to helping Zhang as a partner. Miao confessed to going to collect debts and being arrested. Judge Li Changnian verified the confessions and ordered that the trial be adjourned to another date. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department's Letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association States that Telephone Price Increase Will Not Be Changed</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the International Settlement sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, stating that they received the letter of August 30 regarding the protest against the telephone price increase. The department had carefully considered all relevant facts before approving the telephone price increase, and published a statement in the English Gazette on June 24 of this year and the Chinese Gazette on June 29 to explain the reasons for and the process of the price increase. The Chinese Gazette was sent to your association for distribution, and I hope you will be aware of it. The letter states that the conversion of the automatic telephone in the out-of-bounds area was not completed within the stipulated time, which shows that the contract between the Public Works Department and the telephone company has been broken. According to the English Gazette of April 3 last year and the Chinese Gazette of April 8, the department published a statement stating that because the Chinese authorities prevented the telephone company from performing its duties, the company was exempted from its obligation to convert out-of-bounds areas. When the department made this decision, it believed that the company's efforts to improve the telephone were for the benefit of the public and regretted the attitude taken by the municipal government. However, this obstruction was beyond the company's control, so it was allowed to be exempted from its obligation to convert out-of-bounds areas under the current contract. Your association has not taken this statement into account, which is regrettable. If you send representatives to the department, we are very willing to explain it in person. I hereby reply to you.</p>

<p>Merchants Refuse to Open Jars for Sale</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pickled Meat Industry Association convened a temporary members' meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the method of opposing the proposal of the Municipal Finance and Health Bureaus to collect an inspection fee of half a yuan per dan of pickled pork.

The merchants are unable to bear the burden and cannot agree. First, the four major reasons for opposing the inspection are detailed, and a letter is sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the authorities to cancel the proposal. (2) Before the authorities officially announce the cancellation of the proposal, all pickled meat merchants will not be allowed to open jars for sale from the 25th. (3) Fragrant meat will also not be allowed to be purchased or sold. (4) If the authorities refuse to withdraw the proposal, all members will go to the municipal government to petition and vow to achieve the goal. At that time, the attitude of the whole body was firm and the situation was very tense. Until 6:00 p.m., because it was late, the remaining problems were handed over to the Executive Committee for handling, and a temporary members' meeting would be held again if necessary.</p>
<h3>Record of the Chunyang Lane Tenants' Association</h3>
<p>The tenants of Chunyang Lane in Hongkou have repeatedly appealed to various party and government agencies and requested mediation from the court due to the oppression of the landlord, Jinxing Real Estate Company, but they have been unable to reach a harmonious agreement. Recently, the dispute has expanded. The Chunyang Lane Tenants' Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday. More than 30 committee members attended.

Subsequently, Yuan Yanghua, Xu Zhaochun, and Wang Xiaolin reported that more than 60 members were extremely angry at the landlord's initiative and were willing to contribute a month's rent as the association's operating and litigation expenses to deal with the landlord. Discussion items: (1) Case of supplementary collection of a small number of membership fees. Hua Guangxiang proposed that those who are hesitating to pay should be required to pay, and those who are repeatedly watching should be regarded as saboteurs. Eight committee members, including Xu Zhaochun and Cai Ziqing, were appointed on the spot to be responsible for inspection. (2) Investigation of bank receipts for each household and the case of rent due in September. Hua Guangxiang, Zhao Cangming, and Xi Shanglong were elected to be responsible for investigating and collecting with the secretary. (3) Fundraising.

<h3>The Gospel for Those Suffering from Leprosy</h3>
<p>Asarum, a Worthless Herb</p>
<p>Can Completely Cure Leprosy</p>
<p>World News Agency reports: The suffering caused by leprosy and the difficulty in treating it are almost universally known. Now, there is a sensational piece of news, namely, that leprosy can be treated and cured. It happened in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China, when Mr. Pang Xingcun, the former magistrate of Yancheng County, went to Huai'an to handle spring relief. He noticed that the police officer Zhang Yongmao, who was assigned to serve him by the county government, had an unusual complexion. Upon inquiring, he learned that Zhang had suffered from severe leprosy and was considered incurable. He encountered an old man who gave him a treatment formula, and after taking it for less than half a month, he was cured. Over the years, he has also raised children, all of whom are lively and healthy, and he has once again enjoyed the happiness of family. The method involves using the cocklebur plant, which is abundant everywhere. Starting from the day of the Lesser Heat solar term, gather the leaves and roots of this plant (the seed is covered with thorns and is called cocklebur, often used as medicine by traditional Chinese medicine). Take the stems and leaves, chop them up, boil them until soft, extract the juice, and simmer it into a paste without adding any other ingredients. Take one or two spoonfuls mixed with water after each meal. It will cure in half a month, and even severe cases will be cured in one or two months. After recovery, one will be like a normal person and will not relapse, it is said. Now, we will publish the correspondence between Mr. Pang Xingcun and various individuals to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Pang Xingcun's Letter to Dharma Master Yin: I have come to Huai'an to inspect relief efforts and have obtained an effective formula for treating leprosy. The formula uses a worthless herb that can be found everywhere. Boil the herb in water, simmer the water into a paste, and take it mixed with water after each meal. It will be completely cured in less than a month. Even if the eyebrows and hair have fallen out, the face is like burning fire, the fingernails have completely fallen off, and the joints are damaged, it will still be completely cured in no more than two months. After recovery, one will be like a normal person. Zhang Yongmao, a messenger assigned by the county government, was one of the most severely afflicted by leprosy. When he was severely ill, his symptoms were as described above, and his face was so hot and unbearable that he had to cool it with cold tofu, changing it when it got warm. He thought he would surely die, but he met an old man who passed on this formula to him, and he was cured after taking it for half a month. Since then, countless people have been cured. It is said that the most leprosy sufferers in the world are in Guangdong, where both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are helpless. Fearing contagion, leprosy hospitals are set up to isolate them. It is heartbreaking to think that people, born of heaven and earth, are afflicted with this incurable disease and are ostracized by humanity. I regret not being able to save them. Now, I am fortunate to have obtained this formula and eagerly wish to make it public. Mr. Zhang Jianyu is willing to take on the responsibility of simmering the paste and sending it to Guangdong. Starting from the sixth day of the sixth month, which is the Lesser Heat solar term, which is not to be missed, gather a lot of this herb, boil the juice, and simmer it into a paste to await requests from patients. Mr. Zhang's Yisheng Pharmacy is located on the main street in Huai'an city. Those who can introduce this paste to leprosy hospitals are asked to send a letter requesting it, and it will be sent immediately free of charge. Try it to see if it is effective. Next year, during the Lesser Heat solar term, we will prepare as much as possible to meet the demand.</p>
<p>Zhang Jianyu's Letter to Pang Xingcun: Regarding the leprosy paste, after you made it public, I immediately rushed to handle it, purchasing over 3,000 catties of fresh cocklebur plants (first dried in the sun to prevent mold during simmering). I assigned several dedicated staff members to take turns overseeing the production, using the large steamers from the porridge factory to boil and simmer throughout the night. It took about half a month to complete. Currently, we have collected about 150 catties of pure paste. I wanted to simmer more, but unfortunately, the season has passed. With the existing paste, calculating 3 mace (approx. 11 grams) per person per day, we can treat over 400 people for half a month.</p>
<p>Currently, there is Zhang Shenben, who sells foreign soap for a living. He said that after taking the paste, his fever has subsided, his appetite has increased, and his strength has returned. There is also Pan Lizhong, 38 years old, from Guanyun County, currently living in a small temple at the west ferry of the Grand Canal in Huai'an. Six days after taking the paste, his face, which had not been sweating before, is now sweating. His ten fingers, which could not be extended before, can now be extended. His appetite has increased from one bowl of rice to three bowls, and he can taste his food. He can now walk six or seven li (approx. 3-3.5 km). According to the statements of Zhang and Pan, the effects are quite rapid.</p>
<p>Zhang Jianyu's Letter to Li Yuanjing: After repeated experimentation, I am confident in the method of simmering cocklebur. This year, during the Lesser Heat solar term, I purchased over 30 dan (approx. 1500 kg) of cocklebur plants at the Huai'an Public Welfare Hall. I cut them into pieces about two inches long, dried them in the sun, and then used the large steamers from the porridge factory to boil the juice for about 60 hours. I filtered out the juice and then refined it in a large pot, adding carefully and simmering slowly for about half a month. I used 2,000 catties of coal and about 15,000 catties of water in the pot and steamers. I simmered the paste without adding any sugar. The juice was simmered into over 200 catties, stored in three urns, and placed in willow baskets. I am sending one urn to you first. This herb must be gathered after the Lesser Heat and before the Autumn Begins solar term; it is ineffective after the Autumn Begins. Please study it carefully. Before the Autumn Begins, there are worms inside the cocklebur seed; they emerge after the Autumn Begins, so it is useless. Remove the roots of the herb; everything else is useful.</p>

<h3>County First District Defense Corps Captures Bandit Leader</h3>
<p>Zhu Xingsheng</p>
<p>Handed Over to the County Government for Legal Processing</p>
<p>The First District Defense Corps of Minhang Town, County, captured bandit leader Zhu Xingsheng in Xixiang yesterday. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, this bandit, along with Zhou Asi, He Xiaoamei, Gao Xiuhe, and ten others, robbed the home of Shen Shijin, a postal worker in Huibei, stealing silver dollars, jewelry, clothing, and other items worth over 1,000 taels of silver. Subsequently, Zhou Asi, He Xiaoamei, Gao Xiuwu, and others were captured by the Defense Corps' informants and sent to the former Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, which confirmed the facts. They were sentenced to imprisonment in various locations. However, the bandit leader Zhu Xingsheng escaped to the Xitang area of Jiaxing and remained at large. He was never arrested until recently, when it was reported that he was hiding in the countryside. He was then arrested by the District Defense Corps. After District Commander Zhang Jingling confirmed the facts, he was handed over to the County Government for legal processing.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit over the Obscene and Evil Hell Novel</h3>
<p>Sha Buqi Resides in the City</p>
<p>The Special First Court Dismisses the Case</p>
<p>The "Obscene and Evil Hell" book published by the Ziluolan Bookstore contains insinuations about the affair between actors Zhao Junyu, Liu Kunrong, Mao Yunke, and the concubine of Chu Yupuk. Zhao and others believe that the events are fabricated and close to insult. Recently, they filed a complaint with the Special First Court, accusing the book of defaming their reputation. The case was handled yesterday afternoon by Judge He in the Fifth Criminal Court. Chinese Constable No. 2591 Guo Xiangyao reported that he had been ordered by the court to deliver summons to the Ziluolan Bookstore and Sha Buqi at the Haoyundao Bookstore on Jiaotong Road at 4 PM on the 24th of this month. According to the staff of the Haoyundao Bookstore, the bookstore had already moved, so he could not deliver the summons. The three plaintiffs also did not appear in court yesterday, and their agent lawyer responded to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs' agent lawyer, Zhang Feixiong, stated that the defendants had moved to the area near the Grand Theater on Sanma Road, opposite the Xirongsheng Social Hall in the Imperial Palace, and that Sha Buqi himself resided in the city but usually went to the Ziluolan Bookstore to handle matters and was also a small shareholder of the bookstore. He also presented a copy of the "Luo Bao Han" newspaper dated September 26 to the court, pointing out the address and other information listed in it. Judge He then asked, "Who is responsible for the defendant, the Ziluolan Bookstore? The name, address, place of origin, and age are not stated in the complaint. Sha Buqi also resides in the Chinese Concession. According to Articles 343-3 and 343-4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, this case should be dismissed." The plaintiffs' agent lawyer argued that the defendant, the Ziluolan Bookstore, must have a manager who can be held responsible. Although Sha Buqi resides in the Chinese Concession, he conducts business at the bookstore, and the bookstore's activities, such as publishing books, are within the jurisdiction of the First Special Court. Since one of the co-defendants is within the jurisdiction, the case should be accepted. Judge He stated, "Although this case is dismissed by this court, you can file a lawsuit with the District Court. You can proceed after the ruling is delivered."</p>

After reaching Minhang, they used a barge to transport the cars across the Huangpu River, passing through Zhapu and Haining to Hangzhou, arriving at the West Lake at 5:30 PM. This time was a test drive, and the Minhang Wharf had not yet been completed, so barging took time, and they also stopped to take photos along the way, so it took more than ten hours. In the future, when the road is open to traffic, it will only take four hours to reach Hangzhou. Chen Ticheng, the director of the road administration, has extensive experience in road construction. The roads along the way are smooth, and the culverts and bridges are very stable. Driving on them is like walking on a wide road, with no bumps.

<h3>A Huge Amount of Morphine Seized on the Yihuo Xianghe Steamer</h3>
<p>Hidden in Chicken Egg Baskets</p>
<p>Valued at Over One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Customs seized a large batch of opium and morphine on the Jiangda Steamer, the customs has been closely monitoring reports that more contraband is being shipped to Shanghai soon. Yesterday, the British steamer Xianghe arrived, and a large amount of morphine, valued at millions, was found on board. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Inspection: Since the Jianghai Customs seized a large batch of opium on the Jiangda Steamer, it has been paying close attention to steamers arriving from the Yangtze River. This time, the Yihuo Xianghe Steamer, coming from Shashi and Yichang to Shanghai, arrived at around 11 AM on the 26th. As usual, it was scheduled to dock at the Shuntai Wharf. At that time, the Fusheng and Gonghe steamers were docked, so the Xianghe Steamer changed its course and anchored on the river surface in front of the wharf. As soon as the ship dropped anchor, the Nanheshun Customs Brokerage, which reported shipping chicken eggs, sent people to Yihuo to request the extraction of a batch of fresh eggs shipped from Shashi from the ship's side. The Yihuo head of the ship's room had already agreed, so he instructed the customs brokerage to notify the Jianghai Customs first, and then extract the goods. The customs, upon receiving the request from Nanheshun, became suspicious and agreed to release the goods while sending a search team to inspect them. As a result, a large amount of morphine was found in the eggs.</p>
<p>Contraband Seized: Customs search team members went to the Xianghe Steamer to search and found that there were a total of 156 baskets of chicken eggs reported by Nanheshun. Among them, 96 baskets were marked with the 號 symbol, while the other 60 baskets had no symbol. The search team members first lifted six baskets of chicken eggs from the cabin for inspection. Morphine was stored in the middle of the egg baskets. All six baskets contained morphine. The search team immediately detained all 96 baskets of eggs with the symbol and brought them back to the customs office on a small steamer and stored them in the customs warehouse. In total, 96 bags of morphine were seized.</p>
<p>Tracing the Source: The exact weight and number of the 96 bags of morphine seized are not yet known, but it is said that they are worth over one million yuan. The customs authorities have now confiscated all of the drugs and temporarily detained the eggs. The customs are strictly investigating the smugglers.</p>
<h3>Zhao A'duo Dies for a Jar</h3>
<p>Saying "We're Acquainted" Did Not Help</p>
<p>Inevitable Death Under the Guns</p>
<p>The case of Zhao A'duo, a Shaoxing native who planted vegetables in the Xiyang Garden, a plantation of the Chaozhou Association on Luban Road in the west of Shanghai, being robbed by more than ten bandits on the night of the 25th of this month and injured to death, was reported yesterday. Yesterday, the landlord Gu Zhonglian reported to the District Court, which commissioned Prosecutor Wu and an investigator to inspect the scene. They found that Zhao A'duo had knife wounds on his head, one gunshot wound on his abdomen, and one gunshot wound on his left leg. The bullets had not penetrated his body. It was confirmed that he had died from his injuries. After filling out the death certificate, the family members of the deceased stated that the deceased was 41 years old this year. He usually planted and sold vegetables, working diligently and thriftily. All the money he had was stored privately, which was very secretive, even his family did not know. The previous night, about seventeen or eighteen bandits, armed with pistols and sharp blades, whose accents were mostly from Anhui, broke into the house and robbed a package of clothes and more than forty silver dollars. They also robbed a small jar, which contained Zhao A'duo's lifelong savings, a large amount of cash. Zhao hid it under the bed, so his family did not know how much money was in it. Therefore, Zhao was anxious and grabbed the bandit who was robbing the jar, saying that they were acquainted and should leave it. The bandits, upon hearing this, immediately stabbed Zhao in the head with a knife and fired several shots, causing severe injuries. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but died. The official instructed them to prepare for the funeral and wait for the arrest of the murderers. However, yesterday, the police station of the Second District arrested twelve people, including Yin Xiaobao, who were found to be the bandits involved in this case. They are currently being interrogated strictly.</p>

<h3>Huang Xianglin Attempts Suicide in the River and is Rescued</h3>
<p>When the ferry at Qichang Pier in Pudong departed at 5 PM the day before yesterday, a young man among the passengers suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. The ticket seller on the ferry noticed and stopped the ferry to rescue him, preventing him from drowning. He was sent to the Qichang Pier Third District Police Station and then transferred to the Third District. After questioning, the young man gave his name as Huang Xianglin, from Yangzhou, 22 years old. He previously opened Yuanshun Printing House on Haining Road, but the business was slow, resulting in a loss of over 300 yuan. He was also swindled out of over 300 yuan by his store partner Zhou Jizhang, who has disappeared without a trace. He is now burdened with debt and unable to make amends, so he had no choice but to take this last resort. A suicide note was found on Huang, the meaning of which was similar to what he had stated. Director Zhang decided to send Huang, along with the suicide note, to the Public Security Bureau yesterday for assistance.</p>

<h3>Robbers Fire Guns Along the Road</h3>
<p>Injuring Three Passersby</p>
<p>Patrol police officers Lu Zhenming and Shao Zhenhong, and detectives Yang Fuchen and Zhang Bingqing of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, were inspecting pedestrians near the northern part of the railway on Gonghe New Road around 6:30 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, at the intersection of Jingjiang Road in that area, a robber wearing a black jacket and pants was standing next to a fruit stall, appearing to be doing something. Upon seeing the detectives, he fled north frantically and turned into Taiyangmiao Road, escaping into the open space of the Jiajun Association Hall. He fired five or six shots from his pistol along the way. The police detectives did not dare to open fire because it was the time when factories were letting out, and there were many pedestrians on the road. They chased him directly to Zhongxing Road, near the Quanwan Association Hall, before firing two shots in return, but both missed. The robber escaped into the darkness at this time. They searched the nearby shantytowns but found nothing. However, when the robber fired his gun along the way, stray bullets injured three male and female pedestrians, who were bleeding profusely. Fortunately, they were all injured in the legs and were not in danger of death. They are now being treated at Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road. They are Ji Jinguan (male), 56 years old, from Pudong, living at 183 Yongxing Road; Qian Liu, 28 years old, from Funing, living in a shantytown at 109 Taiyangmiao Road; and Qian Wang, 27 years old, from Yangzhou, living in a shantytown at 41 Taiyangmiao Road. Their husbands all pull rickshaws for a living.</p>
<h3>Robbers Hire a Car to Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>Losses at a Bar on Shanzhong Road</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:45 AM, four well-dressed robbers went to the Yunfei Automobile Company and rented a car with the license plate number 12305, drove to a bar at 264 Shanzhong Road, French Concession, and committed robbery. Two robbers took out pistols and intimidated the patrons into silence. They robbed over 150 yuan in cash, banknotes, and small change, and then escaped without a trace in the original car.</p>
<h3>Luo Xiechen Accused of Enticement and Adultery</h3>
<p>Two Matchmakers Also Accused</p>
<p>Luo Xiechen, a wealthy merchant from Jiading who runs a rice business in Shanghai, is already married with children, but he is naturally lustful and often asks friends to find beauties for him to take as concubines. In the summer of last year, his friends Chen Youshi and Shao Xikui told him that there was a woman named Cheng Cuie, who was just twenty years old and still unmarried, in Loutang Town. If he was interested, they would act as matchmakers. Luo, hearing this, entrusted them with the task. At that time, the woman's family did not know that Luo was already married, so they agreed to marry their daughter to him. On September 26 of that year, the wedding ceremony was held. After the honeymoon, the two came to Shanghai, where the woman learned that Luo already had a wife and was placed in a separate residence. For several months, they barely managed to live together. Now, unable to endure it any longer, they hired lawyers Wu Peng and He Yijun to sue Luo for enticement and adultery, and malicious abandonment in the District Court. Chen and Shao, the two matchmakers, were also jointly sued for conspiracy to commit adultery. The woman claims to come from a prominent family and knows propriety and righteousness. Luo Xiechen used fraudulent means to make the woman believe that they had a marital relationship and submit to his adultery. She says that he has assets of hundreds of thousands of yuan and owns dozens of stores, relying on his wealth and power. When she tried to negotiate with him, he became enraged and abused her at will. He has recently been planning to abandon her, which clearly violates Article 144 of the Criminal Code on fraud and adultery and Article 30 on abandonment. Chen Youshi and Shao Xikui have acted in concert to commit fraud and adultery and should be punished separately. She is also seeking compensation for losses of 50,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan for living expenses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Shixun opened the court to summon the defendants, but none of them appeared. Luo Xiechen's representative lawyer, Yan Luqing, stated that Luo had just received the summons the day before and had gone to Jiading this morning to invite Chen and Shao, so he was unable to appear in court. He requested a postponement. The plaintiff's lawyer had no objection to this request. Judge Ge then ordered that the case be postponed.</p>
<h3>Sanxin Yarn Factory Manager Sheng Yulin Accused of Breach of Trust</h3>
<p>Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>After the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, its manager Sheng Yulin was found by the factory's workers to have embezzled the workers' due bonuses. Yu Hexin, Chen Zhugao, Yu Guoxiang, and others filed a lawsuit against Sheng for embezzlement and attached a civil lawsuit requesting repayment of the funds. Sun Heji, the factory's accountant, was also jointly accused due to his position. The District Court held several trials over several months. All witnesses have now been investigated. Yesterday afternoon, the trial judge Chuan Lin opened the court to summon both parties and announced the verdict: Sheng Yulin was found guilty of breach of trust and fined 300 yuan. If he chooses imprisonment in lieu of the fine, it will be at a rate of three yuan per day. The portion of the lawsuit concerning damage was dismissed. The plaintiffs' attached civil lawsuit against Sheng Yulin was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. The portion of the self-lawsuit against Sun Heji was not accepted.</p>
<h3>衣莊司賬盜有支票</h3>
<p>又竊取現洋百餘元</p>
<p>The bookkeeper of a clothing store stole a check,</p>
<p>and also stole more than one hundred yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Hu Yukun, a Danyang native who worked as a bookkeeper at Chen Zhentai Clothing Store at No. 1049 Hanbi Road, privately stamped a check with the store's seal on the 6th of this month and secretly cashed it for 200 yuan at the Broadway Road branch of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. He then fled to Suzhou. Subsequently, the local Public Security Bureau detectives arrested Hu. The store owner, Chen Mingde, a Ningbo native, reported the case to the police station, which dispatched Detective Liu Junjie to Suzhou. Liu brought Hu back the day before yesterday and detained him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Simple Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Hu Jiabao, stated the case, roughly saying that the police station had notified the bank to send someone to the court, but no one had arrived today and had not assisted. He requested that the case be rescheduled and that witnesses be summoned for another hearing, and so on. Then, the plaintiff Chen Mingde claimed that in addition to privately stamping the check and fraudulently withdrawing 200 yuan, the defendant had also taken 140 yuan in cash and spent it. He requested that the defendant be held accountable. When questioned, the defendant directly admitted to fraudulently withdrawing the money, but claimed that he had already spent it all and could not return it. Judge Wu verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The hearing was rescheduled and witnesses were summoned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>空頭支票罰廿元</h3>
<p>朱學祺誤在逃逸</p>
<p>A bad check results in a fine of twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Zhu Xueqi mistakenly fled.</p>
<p>Zhu Xueqi, a Western-style doctor from Jiaxing, rented the premises of Chunlin Hospital at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Mintini Road, from Feng Baorong, the owner of Ronglingxuan Dental Clinic at No. 611 Fada Road, in June. He opened Xueqi Hospital, but soon accumulated rent arrears of 190 yuan. He gave two bad checks from the China Land Reclamation Bank, totaling 120 yuan, and then abandoned the hospital and fled. Feng reported the matter to the police station. Detectives found Zhu hiding in Room 328 of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road. They rushed there and arrested Zhu the day before yesterday noon. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police station's lawyer presented the case, prosecuting him for fraud and breach of trust under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff, Feng Baorong, recounted the previous events and requested the recovery of the debt. Zhu confessed to paying the first month's rent and only owing two months' rent. Regarding the checks, he claimed that they were given to him by patients and he did not know they were bad. After verifying the confession, Judge Zhang sentenced Zhu Xueqi to a fine of 20 yuan for knowingly issuing checks without funds in his account. If he was unable to pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The remaining part was deemed not guilty. The accompanying civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. The defendant was ordered to provide a guarantee that he would be available for questioning when summoned.</p>
<h3>市商會請免土靛稅捐</h3>
<p>援照土布辦法以資救濟</p>
<p>The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce requests exemption from taxes on native indigo,</p>
<p>referring to the native cloth measures for relief.</p>
<p>The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting exemption from all taxes on native indigo. The original text read: "Submitting a petition: On the 26th of this month, we received a letter from the Qinglan Cloth Dyeing Industry Guild, stating that the Guild had previously submitted a proposal to your Chamber for referral to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for handling the issue of relief and improvement of native indigo. Subsequently, your Chamber forwarded the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's instruction No. 4637, which the Guild found satisfactory in all respects. However, regarding the exemption from tax regulations, it stated that it would be reviewed after the improvement measures were decided, which does not align with the purpose of the request. Therefore, we earnestly request your Chamber to resubmit the request to the Ministry of Finance for immediate exemption to demonstrate promotion and alleviate the burden. It is well known that domestic indigo is most closely related to the dyeing industry. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, the annual output of domestic indigo exceeds three million yuan. The annual output of Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and other provinces also exceeds one to two million yuan. The sales volume is not insignificant. Since the late Qing Dynasty, foreign indigo (i.e., German-produced) has gradually been imported. At that time, domestic indigo was subject to numerous exorbitant taxes and levies, resulting in high costs. Therefore, foreign indigo, which was cheap and of good quality, was adopted, resulting in a staggering annual outflow of money. During the European War of the third year of the Republic, the output of foreign indigo decreased due to the impact of the war, and prices soared. Our dyeing industry then resumed the use of domestic indigo, so domestic indigo gradually regained momentum. However, during the warlord era, exorbitant taxes and levies were even worse than before, causing people in the dyeing industry to dare not adopt it. After the end of the European War, the import volume of foreign indigo increased sharply, and prices were reduced to achieve its aggressive means. Poor domestic indigo is always burdened by heavy taxes and cannot compete with foreign indigo. By the fifteenth year of the Republic, it was completely eliminated, thus completing its economic aggression plan. Millions of farmers who planted indigo lost their jobs one after another. Therefore, they were forced to take risks and become bandits, which was inevitable. Since the elimination of domestic indigo, foreign indigo merchants, knowing that our country has no goods to replace it, have gradually increased prices. Our dyeing industry is all small-scale operations, so how can they bear this heavy burden? If this continues, there will always be a day of bankruptcy, and farmers who plant indigo will never have the opportunity to resume their business. Thinking of this, we are angry and worried. Therefore, we specifically wrote to your Chamber, earnestly requesting that the above situation be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. Domestic indigo should be exempted from all tax rates so that the industry can gradually recover, etc., to the Chamber. It was found that the previous instruction No. 4637 of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that the request to consult the Ministry of Finance for exemption from export tax should also be reviewed after the improvement measures are decided and implemented, etc. In our opinion, improving native indigo, such as setting up a field for testing and providing guidance, requires considerable expenses and time. The matter is in the experimental stage, and the scope must be gradually expanded. Therefore, at the beginning of the process, farmers may not understand the purpose and feelings will arise. In recent years, internal taxes in various provinces have been numerous, and the rural areas have gone bankrupt. During this period, the sales of native indigo have been stagnant and taxes are heavy. We are afraid that the improvement process of native indigo has not yet been completed, and the farmers' indigo planting areas have already changed to planting other crops. Therefore, the encouragement of improving native indigo and the maintenance of the current native indigo should be carried out in parallel without conflicting with each other. This is evidenced by the manual native cloth in the seventh year of the Republic, where exemption from taxes was purely for the purpose of maintaining rural side businesses. Therefore, it is even more obvious that the case of native indigo should be handled by analogy. Moreover, it has been found that in indigo-producing provinces, such as Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi, the name is abolition of likin, but various exorbitant levies in the interior have not been completely eliminated. The production and sales tax in Jiangxi Province is particularly prominent. The defense areas in Fujian Province are divided, and the names of taxes are created at will, which outsiders cannot imagine. Therefore, the industry's request for exemption from all tax rates is actually a measure that the government should take to eliminate exorbitant taxes. It is reasonable to prepare a document based on the situation and submit it to your Ministry for review and approval."</p>
<h3>皖同鄉會公祭洪明度</h3>
<p>撫卹彭養吾</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association held a public memorial ceremony for Hong Mingdu,</p>
<p>and provided relief to Peng Yangwu.</p>
<p>Hong Mingdu, an executive committee member of the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, ran a yarn factory and was particularly enthusiastic about social welfare. He previously served as a standing director of the association, sparing no effort in maintaining the association's affairs. Before the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, he actively planned ways to resist inferior goods due to the rampant Japanese aggression, which led to overwork and a stroke that caused his death. His fellow provincials deeply regretted his passing. Yesterday, his sons, Yu Qin and his brothers, set up a memorial altar at the Puyi Agency on Guling Road to receive condolences. Xu Jingren was invited to inscribe the memorial tablet. The association also jointly sent elegies and sacrificial banquets with the Huining Fellow-Provincials Association. More than ten people, including Xu Yibu, Li Zhenya, and Yu Langxi, were publicly elected to represent the association and offer sacrifices, using the Huizhou sacrificial ceremony, which was quite solemn. Furthermore, the association's clerk, Peng Yangwu, was very diligent in his service. He also became ill and died on the 2nd of this month due to overwork when the association sent him to serve in the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association during the Shanghai War this spring, where he was in charge of the 22nd Refugee Shelter. His funeral arrangements were very bleak. The association specifically resolved to provide relief at a regular meeting a few days ago.</p>

<p>Zhi Fa, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, is continuing to run the third session of the temporary free clinic hospital this year. Since the opening of the clinic, countless people have been saved. Recently, due to the mild weather, the number of patients seeking medical treatment has become increasingly crowded, so the organization has been expanded. The original doctors were unable to handle the number of patients, so famous doctors Qian Haibo, Xu Jiuling, Shen Huicang, Gong Jingzhong, Yao Xiliu, etc., have been specially hired to visit the hospital every day to provide diagnosis and medication. It is said that no registration fee is charged. If philanthropists from all walks of life encounter poor and sick people, they can direct them to seek medical treatment, which is an immeasurable merit.</p>

Afterwards, the buying party was overbearing, and the peak was suspected to be outside of the tight exchange rates, but it hovered by one or two taels, the late market was unexpectedly frustrated, initially because the exchange rate was better and the buyers heated up, it suddenly soared, and the new high price of seven hundred and thirty-seven taels and three qian appeared, and then it was suddenly heard that there was a political trend in the UK and that the cabinet had resigned. It also became easy with the exchange rate, and the hedging family pulled back the US dollar and sold the gold price, so the selling spirit permeated, and the price suddenly turned down, afterwards it was calculated to be between thirty-three taels, the turbulence of the market was difficult to predict. To October, Yuan Xing, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Feng, etc. gave it to Rui Kang, Da De Cheng, etc., and the short side still posted it, calculated to be five to four taels and five qian, which was cheaper than the previous week, so the exchange's closing price was only about five taels different.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Feels Very Strong</h3>

HSBC's listed price has already increased by half a notch, calculated as 125 US dollars for one British gold and no change for Hong Kong dollars. The rest are becoming increasingly tight, almost as if internal clearing is about to occur. It then rallied, becoming even better. In the afternoon, it went from tight to loose because the gold market rebounded and went downstream. In the end, it still rose, and the result was that British gold shrank by 0.0625 compared to the day before, and the US dollar shrank by 0.1875. The market situation feels very strong, and transactions in various banks are quite active. It is estimated that 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, mostly settled by Sassoon &amp; Co., with few inquiries from the gold industry. About one million US dollars or more were traded, and various firms first dumped and then bought back, generally seeking more than the supply, resulting in a large number of short positions. There were also hedging operations, such as Yuen Cheong, Yu Feng Yung, and Fook Cheong. The hedging price was close to about 512 taels for the near term and 434 taels for the far term. The settlement price was about 70 taels. Mumbai sold December contracts.</p>

Although sales to customers have not yet reached their peak, the overall situation in various aspects seems to have become slightly more active. The local market originally had a better appearance, but yesterday afternoon, those who pre-sold securities for delivery were very enthusiastic, and the banks' buying appetite was overwhelmed, causing people's hearts to turn from firm to soft. As for the current situation of silver funds, due to the narrow scope of lending in the silver and money industry, silver funds cannot flow smoothly, and there is no good phenomenon from beginning to end.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Plunges</p>
<p>The New Feng Yang Company reported that on Monday (26th), the New York stock market fell across the board due to long positions selling off, new short positions appearing, and powerful people manipulating for profit. Although all kinds of news were very good, the market was being manipulated internally by powerful people. There was also obvious support in the later market, so the major stocks rebounded slightly, but the result was a huge drop compared to the previous day. American Telephone and Telegraph fell more than 3 yuan, Case farm tools and Union Pacific Railroad each fell 4 yuan, and Citibank and electric bond stocks fell more than 4 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 2.1 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>| Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 7.06 | Down 3.77 |</p>
<p>| 20 Railroad Stocks | 34.71 | Down 2.24 |</p>
<p>| 20 Utility Stocks | 31.42 | Down 2.01 |</p>
<p>| 40 Bonds | 81.63 | Up 0.12 |</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Flat and Lifeless</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is extremely flat and lacks any spirit of invigoration. The majority mentality is consistent in viewing fatigue. Because the actual demand is not smooth, raw cotton is increasingly weak, and there are even more people selling short. However, a survey of the inventories of various factories shows that they are still small. The market in recent months has been firm and expensive, but the overall situation is very disorganized.</p>
<p>Many People Bidding to Sell. In the early market of the "Ren Biao," the buying sentiment in the market was not strong because American cotton was flat. The near months rose slightly by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan, and the far months fell by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. In the afternoon, this month was the last day, and the market was still flat, rising by 0.01 yuan and falling by 0.04 or 0.06 yuan in the far months. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,000 bales. A survey shows that Zhen Da sold 1,100 bales, Chang Feng sold 1,100 bales, Yi Chang bought 1,050 bales, Ming De bought 800 bales, Ji Feng bought 700 bales, and Tong Fu bought 600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Ren Biao | Closing Price Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 12 | 1,489, Down 0.08 | 99,650 |</p>
<p>| September | 1,510, Up 0.02 | 17,850 |</p>
<p>| 11 | 1,489, Down 0.07 | 57,350 |</p>
<p>| October | 1,496, Down 0.02 | 58,850 |</p>
<p>| 21 | 1,489, Down 0.09 | 35,050 |</p>
<p>| November | 1,490 | 87,800 |</p>
<p>| Total |  | 356,550 |</p>
<p>Some Spot Yarn is Moving in Southern Ports. The movement of spot yarn is still sluggish, but sporadic transactions in southern ports are still uninterrupted. Other areas are extremely dull. A survey shows that the total purchase by various areas throughout the day was only 620 bales. The purchase amounts for each area are listed below:</p>
<p>| Guangdong | 45 | Inner | 75 | Sichuan | 50 | Ningbo | 15 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Yunnan | 10 | Shantou | 10 | Xuzhou | 20 | Fellow Traders | 25 |</p>
<p>Total 620 bales</p>
<p>Cotton Market Weak</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending weaker, and the situation is becoming increasingly sluggish. As new cotton from various routes is entering the market, the sources on the wharves are increasing daily, which weakens people's hearts even more. In addition, the amount of short-selling by large households is very large, and the pressure is even greater. The resistance of ordinary retail investors is relatively weak, so it is easy to fall and difficult to rise. However, the American cotton situation is also in a state of calm.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Under Heavy Pressure. In the early market of Zheng Biao, the market sentiment was still good because American cotton was flat. However, it fell again by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan at the closing. The market sentiment was even more sluggish in the afternoon because there was talk of a decline in American cotton tomorrow. The selling sentiment was slightly stronger, and each month fell by 0.15 to 0.20 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,100 dan. A survey shows that Da Feng sold 1,300 dan, Ming Hua sold 1,500 dan, Chong Yu sold more than 2,000 dan, and Yu Chang sold 1,700 dan. Chang Feng bought 1,900 dan, Yuan Da bought 3,500 dan, Sui Long bought 1,300 dan, Ji Feng bought 1,100 dan, and Yi Chang bought 1,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Biao | Closing Price Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 1,3195 | Down 0.30 | 412,800 |</p>
<p>| October | 3,190, Down 0.20 | 163,200 |</p>
<p>| 22205 | Down 0.20 | 19,8000 |</p>
<p>| November | 3,190, Down 0.20 | 244,000 |</p>
<p>| Total |  | 1,293,400 |</p>
<p>| December | 3,185, Down 0.30 | 165,400 |</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Factory Demand Still Active. The raw cotton business is still active with the needs of various factories. The sources are estimated to be 2,538 bales of Yao Hua and 700 bales of Tong Hua. The current raw cotton sales prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Nan Shi Hua | 30.00 | Yong Yu Factory buys 500 bales | Spot delivery to factory |</p>

<p>American Cotton Lacks Sellers and is Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was quiet and firm because there was a lack of sellers, excessive rain, and good news from Memphis. Futures rose by 2 to 6 points, spot rose by 5 points, British cotton futures rose by 18 to 21 points, spot rose by 13 points, Egyptian cotton spot rose by 10 points, and Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 26th):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Rice Market Arrives Brisk Sales Dull</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various regions, and there was still plenty of stock in the port. The market sentiment was flat. The daily sales in the street were dull, and the reason was that imported rice arrived briskly. Changxi Beigeng and Su Tong were each short 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, and the new foreign Dujian was also short of corners. The rest of the goods showed an upstream trend.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were 20 to 30 sources from various regions. Trading in the street was not very brisk. Eastern and Western Xinjing arrived, sales were both fine, and the price was mediocre. Jiangyin Kunshan came and went, the appetite was light, and the price fell by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. Changxi Beigeng's new price was set. The central officials slightly repaired the early and late rice with no glory or disgrace. The new customer's spiky rice was slightly moved by the transit, and the market continued to hold up.</p>
<p>Northern Gang Handles Small Squeezed Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was initially sluggish, with small squeezed rice opening at 200 bags and Saigon opening at 400 bags, with prices 0.04 to 0.05 yuan lower. In the afternoon, the market improved as the Northern Gang inquired. The Northern Gang purchased a total of 1,500 bags of small squeezed rice, and the street also continued to handle 300 bags of small squeezed rice. The prices of various rice markets were finally stabilized. The total market sold 2,000 bags of small squeezed rice, priced at 8.37 to 8.35 yuan. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at 9.40 to 9.35 yuan. In addition, Nanjing indica rice has gradually arrived in Shanghai since the new crop was released, but most of it is handled and distributed by the factories in Zhabei themselves and is not sold on the market. Yesterday, there were 150 bags of truck cargo, and 7.25 yuan was opened for sale in the market, which was also taken away by the street.</p>
<p>Foreign rice futures have not been traded for a long time. Yesterday, the Xushenglong Foreign Company sold 500 tons of Saigon from this month, which was settled at 4.25 taels per share in Shanghai spot currency, equivalent to 9 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Flour Market Morning Weary Noon Return</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the opening in the morning, the various months generally showed a flat and weak appearance. Although the quotations of foreign wheat fluctuated, the air of foreign wheat coming to China was still not good, and the market situation was not good. There were few buyers, and the opening prices of various boards were unusually bleak, with a small difference of 0.05 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. Until the opening in the afternoon, it was still not invigorated. Then, a large household bought at a reduced price. Although the quantity was not very smooth, the market sentiment was brought up. However, Gaofeng sold out with the market, and the quantity was equal, so this kind of one-time excitement was still difficult to maintain. As a result, this month was slightly down 0.025 yuan from the previous day, October was up 0.025 yuan, November was up 0.075 yuan, December was up 0.05 yuan, and January was up 0.025 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Quiet In and Out</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a flourishing phenomenon. The quotations of foreign wheat went in and out quickly. The buying and selling of each month stopped again. After checking, there are really not many chips in the market at the moment. No matter which party buys or sells, even large transactions cannot be fully completed. The in and out is actually due to the scarcity of customers, so it shows a natural depression. As a result, October was 0.02 yuan smaller than the previous day, November was unchanged, and December to February were each 0.01 yuan smaller. The spot wheat market is still stable. The opening price of Kaiyuan wheat is 3 taels, 5 qian and 4 fen, Guzhen wheat is 3 taels, 5 qian and 2 fen, Zhenjiang wheat is 3 taels, 4 qian and 8 fen, and Gaoyou wheat is 3 taels, 4 qian and 7 fen, totaling 23 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Rises Slightly</p>
<p>The New Feng Yang Company reported that on Monday (26th), Chicago wheat rose first due to purchases by spot merchants and then fell due to hedging. As a result, there was no major rise or fall compared to the previous day. The transaction volume on the 24th was 20 million bushels. The market prices on the 26th are listed below:</p>
<p>| Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| May Issue | 60.00 | Up 0.125 |</p>
<p>| September Issue New Goods | 51.75 | Unchanged |</p>
<p>| December Issue | 54.625 | Up 0.125 |</p>
<h3>North and South Goods</h3>
<p>New Walnuts Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>The previous batch of new walnuts, Changping walnuts, opened at 14 taels and have now risen to 16 taels. The first batch of Shimen walnuts also arrived yesterday and opened at 17 taels. Haozhou walnuts opened at 13 taels yesterday. New walnut meat, Hanshi Yan walnut meat, is 16 taels, and sales in the local market are 21 taels. The market situation is relatively weak. Tianjin walnut meat is of good quality and the debris is light. Sales are 30 taels, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Huanggang Qinghao Market Turns Loose</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: As the Dutch exchange rate shrank again, the standard gold rose again, and the trend of the guild's disk was still stable. The 24th crude granulated white was 14 taels and 6 qian, and there were few outgoing households, but there were many receiving hands, and the market image was quite good. The 20th medium granulated white was 14 taels, and the 18th medium granulated white was 13 taels and 8 qian. Jinfa opened a new batch of more than 600 bags of bowl-blue at 9 taels and 5.5 fen, and they were all sold. Also, Bingchang's futures were about to be loaded with bowl-blue. The previous day, 300 tons were opened at 2.75 yuan (Dutch currency regulations). Yesterday, it was still being sold on the original plate and could be continued. Also, the Chao Gang opened more than 200 bags of Huanggang blue-green at a price of 9 taels and 3.5 fen, which was about 0.02 yuan lower than before. Also, the Jian Gang opened 30 or 40 boxes of ordinary unified hand ice, and the price was 9 taels and 6 qian per stone. High-quality goods had a slight transaction, and the price did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Gray Warp Has Already Risen 50 to 60 Taels</p>
<p>Since the silk sales of European and American foreign firms in this port turned around in mid-August, the sales of yellow and white silk warp have been smooth for a time, and the unified price has soared, almost reaching a state of rapid development. The sales of British and American eight-cocoon gray warp have also risen in price, and it has also risen sharply by 50 to 60 taels. Although the yellow and white silk warp market has changed repeatedly, and the silk price has risen and fallen suddenly, the gray warp price has remained firm. Yesterday, overseas silk telegrams were still rarely transferred to Shanghai, and Zhonghe Xin Shichang and other gray warps continued to increase their appetite. It is estimated that a total of 60 bags of Shangshen signboard silk were traded at a price of 330 taels (it had previously fallen to 270 taels). Xinfu entered 20 bags of Jinshuang brand 13 to 15 pieces of Shanghai white factory warp, and the price was 730 taels.</p>
<p>The New Autumn Cocoon Silk is Inherently Not Cheap</p>
<p>Reeling 100 catties of pure cocoons requires 600 taels.</p>
<p>This year, the autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangzhe Province is not abundant. After entering the summer, the weather was dry and the mulberry trees withered. The price of leaves was relatively high, and the cost to farmers was inherently not cheap. After the new cocoons were put on the market, silk and cocoon merchants released prices to compete for high-quality cocoons, resulting in a fresh cocoon price that generally required 45 to 46 yuan. Now, dry autumn cocoons are being reeled and manufactured in batches by various silk factories in Shanghai. According to a silk merchant from the factory, this year's autumn cocoon silk is still high. On average, reeling 100 catties of pure cocoons requires about 600 taels. In addition, according to the current foreign silk price, the factory will lose 70 to 80 taels per bale.</p>
<p>Foreign Tea Market Becomes Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port became increasingly quiet. There were no transactions of Zhenmei green tea from various routes in the city. British merchants were all tending to be silent, waiting for the tea sales activities abroad. Yesterday, only the Russian Cooperation Association and Baitou Village Yulong Yingfa and other firms slightly searched for Gongxi, and the rest were deserted. Therefore, the tea market prices also fell uniformly.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Asphalt Sales Clear, Prices Cheap</p>
<p>The asphalt sales yard is mainly based on candle making in autumn, but now after the Shanghai War, autumn sales have been greatly reduced. The reason is that people's livelihood is declining. The so-called incense season in previous years has disappeared invisibly. The use of soap factories has also ended, and the sales of candles are also very light. Although the inventory in various places is not thick, the market's silence is unprecedented in recent years, and people's hearts are inevitably panicked. Hangzhou first lowered prices, and then Hankou followed. The price of Macheng oil in Hankou fell from 17.8 taels to 14.4 taels. However, the previous time Macheng added to 17.8 taels was too much. At that time, the oil in Jingzhou, Hubei, was only slightly more than 17 taels. Today's decline in Macheng is not due to the procedure. Therefore, the heavy Hubei oil is still between 16 taels. In terms of goods, the former was too much, and now it is balanced. The more advanced the continuous retreat, there is no regular track to follow. It is not as appropriate as the gradual advance and slow retreat of Hubei oil. According to the details in the Hankou letter in recent days, the inventory is about 2,000 to 3,000 pieces. In the past years, it was still thin before and after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but this autumn's sales yard is particularly deserted, and the mountain heads report a good harvest this year. In the future, the price of seeds can be expected to be cheap. Therefore, there is no plan to do it early for Chen You. It is only that the more urgent the sale, the more panicked people's hearts, and the more tired the market. The local dealers have little inventory, but I heard that there are still guest goods that have not been opened. The number is not large, but the dealers can't help but flinch because of the current state of the river. Fortunately, the new goods are still two months away. Although the current sales are clear and lead to a slump, the inventory is ultimately thin. When the time comes when the new and old intersect, another change may occur, which cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Pure Antimony Suddenly Rises by More Than Ten Taels</p>
<p>Recently, Hunan pure antimony has not had many incoming goods, and various gangs have been purchasing vigorously. In addition, the foreign business is also booming. Therefore, there is a shortage of goods in the market. The standard has suddenly increased by 11.5 taels, and is now estimated to be 225.5 taels per ton. If zero estimation, it will be no less than 232 or 3 taels per ton. According to people familiar with the inside story of this product, the factory's output has not been widespread recently (due to the influence of the Communist bandits). The market sentiment in this port is good, so the market is afraid of rising and not falling.</p>
<p>700 to 800 Bars of Blue Lead Thrown Out</p>
<p>Blue lead transactions have been quite deserted since the rise, but the market sentiment is very hard, so the market is still able to remain firm. Yesterday, the yellow lead factory and paint company each sold at 0.0755 taels, which was 0.015 taels better than before, and the prices of 0.025 and 0.01 points and other colors have also risen. As a result, the transaction became more prosperous. Although yesterday was Sunday, it also reached 400 to 500 dan, and most of the buyers were guest gangs.</p>
<p>British Steel Plate Market Turns Around</p>
<p>The British steel plate market saw a turnaround yesterday. For example, 0.055 was opened at 5.3 taels, and transactions were heard. It was heard that 700 to 800 bars were opened. The market price was 12.15 taels per dan, which is a futures contract that will be cleared by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Autumn Leather Nails are Still Widely Sold in Tianjin</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 100 boxes of autumn leather nails were handled by the Tianjin gang. Although the market has not increased for a while, the market situation is much better than before. The opening price is 21.4 yuan for 3 points per box, 20.05 yuan for 5 points, and 20 yuan for 6 points</p>
<h3>Gifts for Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The shadow of war only covers the eastern provinces. The Northeast Three Provinces, ravaged for a year, need no mention. Then there was the Guangdong incident, and recently, the Shandong incident. Originally, among our country's provinces outside the Northeast Three Provinces, only Guangdong and Shandong contain the word "East" in their names. The valiant warriors, unable to go outside the pass to the Northeast Three Provinces to participate in the war, first practice in the provinces within the pass that contain the word "East." This is their commemoration of the Orient; they are not unpatriotic.</p>
<p>General public opinion says that the muzzles of our soldiers are pointed inward, and they treat bullets as gifts for internal use. Now, the clash between Han and Liu in Shandong is again following the same old path of internal warfare. I say they are not acting internally but externally. This clash is their preparation of a kind of gift for foreigners.</p>
<p>Foreigners who invade China often fabricate baseless accusations against our country. They sympathize with the foreigners' need to expend too much effort in fabricating things and quickly offer them a gift for foreigners. Foreigners who are biased towards a certain side intend to search for our country's greatest weaknesses to use as material to justify their bias. They sympathize with the foreigners' inability to find adequate material and quickly offer them a gift for foreigners.</p>
<p>What is this gift? Of course, it is not bullets, but a timely and appropriate gift for foreigners—a significant pretext.</p>
<h3>What's the Point of Banning Opium?</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Yuan</p>
<p>丨A Scene of Utter Chaos丨</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Daoguang reign, opium imports reached 28,011 chests. In Guangdong province alone, silver dollars exported from the fourteenth to the sixteenth year of the Daoguang reign reached more than 30 million taels. The outflow of profits was truly alarming. Therefore, Mr. Lin Zexu said, "If this disaster is not eliminated, in ten years, we will have no soldiers to use and no funds to raise." Hence, he requested a ban. Unfortunately, after the war with England, not only did we pay war reparations and cede Hong Kong, but foreign powers were granted five ports for trade, and opium was sold even more rampantly in China.</p>
<p>Originally, to resist foreign goods, one had to promote domestic goods. Patriotic individuals, seeing this, caused a large amount of opium to be produced domestically within a few years, which naturally recovered some profits. Some places even forcibly ordered farmers to abandon rice cultivation and plant opium poppies because the profits were many times greater than those from rice and wheat. With more production, the government could collect more taxes, and the country would have no worries about wealth, and the army would certainly have funds. Furthermore, if all Chinese people smoked opium, they could all rouse their spirits and become excited. With hand grenade-like opium pipes, what could a few imperialists possibly amount to?</p>
<p>If officials don't smoke opium, they lack official aura. If soldiers don't smoke opium, they lack military spirit. If the people don't smoke opium, they lack national spirit. The reason why everyone is listless from top to bottom is that they don't smoke opium. Smoke more opium, eat less rice; besides, this is also a way to relieve disaster!</p>
<p>With comprehensive planning, there is no reason to ban opium. If, unfortunately, it is truly banned in ten thousand years, I dare to revise Mr. Lin Zexu's words: "Once this disaster is eliminated, we will immediately have no soldiers to use and no funds to raise."</p>
<h3>Third-Class Tram</h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>丨Random Thoughts丨</p>
<p>Automobiles are fundamentally just a pipe dream. Private cars are out of the question. Even first-class trams are beyond my means. Spending money, making noise, being extravagant—truly, my friend, it's difficult. How easy do you think it is? In Shanghai, you must first understand the pain of being penniless. Even if you want to, even if you are happy, is it realistically possible? To be honest, third-class trams are still the best.</p>
<p>Seats—these are special seats, these are rare things, aren't they? You could also say they don't exist. People and things, like a pile of loose sand, are stuck together as one, like lacquer and glue, like a blazing fire. To make a comparison, it's like a can of sardines.</p>
<p>One moment, it's like going uphill; the next, it's like going downhill. One moment, it's like a tide, surging back and forth. Isn't it interesting? Or, aren't the various strange sights all the more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Jiangbei women's bound feet, Guangdong girls' braids, factory girls' lunch baskets, low-class prostitutes' buttocks—not only should they be there, they are all there. Sometimes, spittle and phlegm fly everywhere; sometimes, stink and sweat come together. Such a paradise! The Buddha says: Excellent, excellent!</p>
<h3>Riddle</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>丨A Riddle that Chemists Cannot Solve丨</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Xu Jiaohua</p>
<p>丨Beauty in the Eyes of Various Women丨</p>
<p>What is beauty? It is a mysterious art that pushes the wheel of the era and steers the tide. Because of the different environments and interests of various women, it becomes different objects. Now, let's analyze the beauty psychology of general women in society:</p>
<p>(1) What a modern young lady recognizes as beauty is a convertible motorcycle, fashionable outfits changed daily, diamond rings, platinum bracelets, fine dining, and dancing.</p>
<p>(2) What a wealthy man's concubine recognizes as beauty is: a wildly popular opera singer, a strong rickshaw puller, the old master's piles of banknotes, rounds and rounds of mahjong, and an exquisite opium smoking set.</p>
<p>(3) What a female student recognizes as beauty is: couples in pairs, sweet love letters, lovers' photos, tokens of affection, erotic novels, going to the movies, and strolling in the park.</p>
<p>(4) What an old-fashioned woman recognizes as beauty is: a man who must be obeyed, a spoiled and coquettish young official, brand new cheongsams, trendy haircuts, gambling away the days, going to the Great World amusement park, watching modern opera, a pure gold ring on her hand, and a gold mouthpiece in her mouth.</p>
<p>(5) What a prostitute recognizes as beauty is: diamond rings and fabrics obtained through extortion, gambling with a heavy stake and drinking, the flirtatious glances of popular martial arts actors in the theater, a penniless young man who takes her money, and a hired car rushing about like something important is happening.</p>
<p>Others: There are also the wives of important figures who like to show off, dancers with fleshy sensuality, female office workers who are called vases, little sisters in government offices who flirt and scold, etc. The beauty they recognize is similar to the above types. Is this beauty? Ah, the mystery of beauty!</p>
<p>Arts News: Yongjia calligrapher and painter Ma Mengrong was invited by the gentlemen of the Chinese Arts and Learning Society in July to come to Shanghai to help with the exhibition. He temporarily resided at No. 55 Li Mingde Lane, staying for two months. Suddenly, he fell ill with abdominal pain the day before yesterday and was immediately admitted to Renji Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. According to the doctor, he suffered from appendicitis. He underwent surgery, but lost too much blood and was unable to sleep for days, leading to mental exhaustion. We heard that he passed away at 3:10 PM on Saturday, September 24th! Mr. Ma's calligraphy followed the style of the Two Wangs, gathering knowledge from Nanping and starting with Nantian. Recently, he devoted himself to creativity, claiming to have established his own unique style, which was praised by contemporary scholars. People near and far who heard the news came to offer condolences, lamenting his passing.</p>
<h3>Silver Threads (26)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>

<p>They were all walking very fast. In less than ten minutes, they had arrived at their house. The gate was open, and it was quiet without a sound. In the center of the main room stood the embroidery frame, but there were no embroidery pieces on the frame. Scissors and embroidery needles were still on the table.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Yu! Mrs. Yu!" As soon as Regiment Commander Yuan entered the door, he called out to Fenruo, but there was no response from Fenruo. Instead, Mr. Wang, who delivered embroidery work, came down from upstairs.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Mr. Wang was shocked to see the county magistrate, the director of public security, the police, and Regiment Commander Yuan holding the madwoman with a bloody head. He missed a step on the landing and fell down.</p>
<p>"Where is Mrs. Yu?" As Mr. Wang got up from the ground, Regiment Commander Yuan asked again, "Alas! She's dead."</p>
<p>"What? She was just fine, how could she be dead?"</p>
<p>At this time, Dr. Zhang also came downstairs. He was very familiar with the director of public security, so he reported, "I was about to report to the bureau. This woman committed suicide with a pistol and could not be saved."</p>
<p>"How do you know she committed suicide and came to treat her?" The director of public security's face turned pale, and he began to perform his duties.</p>
<p>"I was attending Regiment Commander Yuan's monument inauguration ceremony at the assembly ground. It just so happened that my son was also very tired these past two days, so I was very sorry."</p>
<p>"After the meeting, I went home first. Then, this Mr. Wang, who delivers embroidery work, came and told me that Yu Fenruo had committed suicide with a gun. I brought some medical supplies and rushed with him to treat her, but she shot herself in the temple. The bullet entered from the left and exited from the right. There was excessive bleeding, and her brain was damaged, so there was no hope." Dr. Zhang reported truthfully.</p>
<p>"Then how do you know she committed suicide?" The director of public security sternly asked Mr. Wang again.</p>
<p>"This gentleman was here just now," Mr. Wang said, pointing at Regiment Commander Yuan. "I just happened to buy a watermelon for him and brought it over. I said a few words and was about to leave when Mrs. Yu entrusted me to find Dr. Zhang to give the madwoman an injection. So I went to the assembly ground to look for him, but I didn't find him. So I came here, wanting to see what the madwoman was like. At this time, Yu Fenruo suddenly told me that she had gone upstairs to do some embroidery. She didn't notice that the madwoman had used a long belt on the upper floor window to hang down and escape. She also asked me to look for her, and at the same time, she took out a paper package and asked me to send it to the assembly ground and give it to Regiment Commander Yuan. I was worried that the madwoman would run to the assembly ground and cause trouble, so I quickly took the paper package and left. Yu Fenruo saw me out the door and was fine at the time, but she didn't close the door. I didn't notice it at the time. Who knew that after I walked a few dozen steps, I suddenly heard a gunshot from upstairs. I hurried back, but she was not downstairs. I went upstairs and saw her lying on the bed, her left hand still holding the pistol. Only then did I realize that she had committed suicide. I was so anxious that I didn't know what to do, so I ran to Dr. Zhang's house and asked him to come and treat her. Alas! What a pity! She will never live again." As Regiment Commander Yuan listened, his face gradually turned white, and he did not say a word. He picked up his wife and ran upstairs, put his wife on another bed, and then went to stroke Fenruo, tears falling down.</p>

<h3>If You Were a Bodhisattva</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country has been kowtowing and begging for mercy from international bodhisattvas everywhere. Natural bodhisattvas are compassionate and relieve suffering, which is their natural duty. But although Buddhist teachings are boundless, they are ultimately like flowers in a mirror, the moon in the water, a fleeting moment. Who retains the bubble? Ordinary sentient beings in the sea of suffering cannot avoid resentment. Everyone says the bodhisattvas are ineffective.</p>
<p>But bodhisattvas, though gold-plated and resplendent, are ultimately just a façade and have no real power. Therefore, our country has repeatedly begged for mercy from the League of Nations, and the League of Nations, on the one hand, uses delaying tactics, such as sending personnel to the Northeast to investigate the incident, etc., and on the other hand, must comply with Japan's demands, postpone the discussion of the report, etc. It can be seen that the Western mirror of the League of Nations, which responds to every request, has long been dismantled by the Japanese. The bodhisattvas must admit that they are ineffective.</p>
<p>It must be known that among the bodhisattvas, opinions are not consistent. There are left-wing bodhisattvas and right-wing bodhisattvas, and the power of the bodhisattvas can only be indicated in the darkness. If one is stubborn and ignorant and relies solely on the bodhisattvas for help, there is no such reason in the world. Therefore, if one wants the bodhisattvas to save all sentient beings, the sentient beings must save themselves. If one wants the bodhisattvas to relieve suffering, the sentient beings must first save themselves. If one does not save oneself, one does not cross oneself, and relies solely on the bodhisattvas, even with immortal rafts and precious vessels, there may be no way to save them.</p>
<p>Not willing to sacrifice oneself, but only hoping that others will sacrifice, not willing to struggle oneself, but only hoping that others will struggle, this is something that even children cannot obtain from their parents. How can one expect to obtain it from international bodhisattvas as a sentient being in the sea of suffering? There has never been such a good bodhisattva in the world. If one does not rush into the battle first but wants to sit on the Azure Dragon's head and watch others kill each other, in this situation, wanting to beg for mercy from the bodhisattvas, the bodhisattvas will laugh and say, "What if you were a bodhisattva?"</p>

<h3>The Method of Making Matches</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zhi</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century today, everyone's need for matches, though inevitably affected by the use of "electricity," is not as urgent as it used to be. But in reality, we still need to use them a lot in our daily lives, so they are still an essential item in our daily needs.</p>
<p>I remember seeing an article by Ding Zhaojun, "The Method of Making Matches," in this publication in April of this year. Although the content was very simple and clear, I feel that this article on the original topic seems to be a bit "empty" and "superficial." I now casually recall the events of half a year ago, so I also venture to write down what I know below, which may be able to supplement what Mr. Ding said by one in ten thousand. (The original article was approximately on April 6th, readers can refer to it)</p>
<p>Matches can be roughly divided into three types: yellow phosphorus matches, red phosphorus matches, and phosphorus-free matches. The manufacturing process is divided into two parts: the chemicals and the wooden sticks. The wooden sticks come in different forms, such as triangular, round, flat, thick, thin, long, and short sticks. The wooden sticks can be made of several materials, such as poplar, banyan, red pine, Yezo spruce, Qin tree, bodhi tree, fir, and Zeng. Poplar is the best. The chemicals can be divided into six types: ignition agent, deflagration agent, combustible material, friction agent, binder, and coloring agent. The important chemicals are phosphorus, potassium chlorate, iron chloride, coal smoke, paraffin, glass powder, sand, antimony trioxide, sulfur, manganese dioxide, potassium dichromate, copper silicate, rosin, glue, iron sulfide, iron sand, ochre, and clay. The amount and type of mixing depend on the properties of the various matches. Here is a brief description of the manufacturing method of the above three types of matches.</p>
<p>(1) Yellow Phosphorus Matches: Yellow phosphorus matches are also called friction matches. They were invented in 1833 by the Austrian Preschel. The ingredients are 2.5 catties of yellow phosphorus, 0.1 catties of long sand, 0.5 catties of iron trioxide, 2 catties of glass powder, 2 catties of glue, and 4.5 pints of water. The manufacturing method is very simple. Just mix these six raw materials in a warm pot, knead them into a muddy shape by hand or other objects, and then insert the sticks to make them adhere. After drying, apply a little fake lacquer. This kind of match will catch fire when rubbed on any sandpaper or wood and stone, so it is very dangerous. Moreover, yellow phosphorus is poisonous, and workers are very prone to poisoning during manufacturing. For this reason, the Berlin Conference in 1906 resolved to ban the sale of this kind of match. Now, in fact, no country uses this kind of match anymore.</p>
<p>(2) Red Phosphorus Matches: Red phosphorus matches are also known as safety matches. They were invented in 1855 by the Swede Lundström. The ingredients can be divided into two types: deflagration agent and ignition agent. The deflagration agent is 1.8 catties of potassium chlorate, 1.6 catties of potassium dichromate, 0.4 catties of sulfur, 1.8 catties of manganese dioxide, 1 catty of manganese trioxide, 1 catty of rosin essence, 2 catties of glass powder, 1 catty of glue, and 4 catties of gum arabic. The ignition agent is 1 catty of red phosphorus, 0.25 catties of iron sulfide, 0.5 catties of carbon black, and 0.3 catties of paste. For this kind of match, the chemical on the stick head is the deflagration agent, which must be rubbed on the paper surface coated with the ignition agent to catch fire, so the degree of danger is less than that of yellow phosphorus matches. Moreover, red phosphorus is non-toxic, so there is no risk of poisoning. Therefore, most of the matches used in the world today belong to this category.</p>
<p>(3) Phosphorus-Free Matches: This kind of match is completely different from the above two, because it does not use phosphorus during manufacturing, but it can be rubbed in any place to catch fire. Its standard composition is as follows: 40 parts of potassium chlorate, 10 parts of copper subsulfonate, 6 parts of copper thiosulfate, 3 parts of ammonium sulfide, 3 parts of calcium sulfate, 4 parts of sulfur, 9 parts of glass powder, and 26 parts of glue (10% solution, i.e., 10 grams of glue dissolved in 100 grams of water) mixed together. It is said that this kind of match has been protected and encouraged by special laws in Germany, France, and other countries, but the manufacturing method has not yet reached complete success!</p>

<h3>My Opinion on Abolishing Saturday Afternoon Rest</h3>
<p>— Dai Ying</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the existence or abolition of the weekend, this publication has repeatedly published articles for detailed discussion. I believe that Sunday rest has become a habit, and we who work six days should have one day of rest. Otherwise, long days of work easily lead to mental fatigue and difficulty in recovering energy. In addition, those of us who serve society have no time to spare on weekdays and rely solely on Sunday to visit friends or make other social engagements. Therefore, the indispensability of Sunday is clear and obvious in fact and in reason.</p>
<p>But in addition to Sunday, it is the custom in Shanghai that all companies, foreign firms, schools, and organizations also implement rest on Saturday afternoons. I believe that although Sunday cannot be abolished, the habit of resting on Saturday afternoons must be abolished. Because the day after Saturday is Sunday, with a full day of rest, then why is it necessary to rest for half a day on Saturday afternoons?</p>
<p>According to general legend, the origin of Saturday afternoon rest was originally because Westerners had to go to church to pray on Sundays and had no time to entertain guests, so Saturday had a half-day of rest. Therefore, when foreigners came to China to do business, the companies and foreign firms they set up were closed on Saturday afternoons. As for the church schools established by foreigners, they also forced students to go to church on Sundays and had a half-day of rest on Saturday afternoons.</p>
<p>But in fact, foreign Christians are in the majority, and very few Chinese are converted. In theory, foreign companies and foreign firms can let them rest on Saturday afternoons, but we Chinese do not need to emulate them. Who knows that after opening up to trade, the Chinese only followed the lead of the Westerners, and seeing that they rested on Saturday afternoons, all organizations, larger firms, and non-church schools established by Chinese also had the custom of resting for half a day on Saturday afternoons. In fact, if foreigners are resting on Saturday because they need to pray on Sunday, why should the Chinese, who have very few converts, learn from them? If it is said that the rest on Saturday afternoon is for the sake of restoring the fatigue suffered during work, then it has already been said above that the next day is Sunday, a full day of rest, so why add half a day? Therefore, the rest on Saturday afternoons is really extremely pointless. Even if half a day of rest is added within a week, it should be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday afternoon, so that the rest is not together in one week, which is more natural and appropriate.</p>
<p>China, under the current circumstances, the industrial and commercial sectors are clamoring to increase production to save the country, and the education sector is shouting to popularize education to save the country. Increasing production and popularizing education can indeed save the country, but requiring increased production requires more work, and to popularize education, students must read more books. In the industrial and commercial sectors and in the education sector, how precious is time! As the saying goes, "An inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time," so how can it be wasted? Therefore, the habit of resting for half a day on Saturday afternoons should be abolished, especially in China, which is a very obvious thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Saturday afternoon rest is not only pointless but also harmful. In general, because of the rest on Saturday afternoons, people have nothing to do at home and may go out to watch movies, visit amusement parks, or even go to prostitutes and gamble, doing degenerate things. As a result, they damage their bodies, waste money, and do no small amount of harm. From this point of view, it is even more obvious that Saturday afternoons should not be rested.</p>

<h3>Cafeteria Sketch</h3>
<p>— Yunliang</p>
<p>Shanghai South S Middle School is the best secondary school in the city, with a total of one thousand five or six hundred students. Every day, people come and go endlessly on SC Road. Nearly five hundred students live on campus. The small cafeteria suffers from overcrowding, so they have to eat in two shifts, each with more than thirty tables, eight people per table, three meals a day, which is very lively.</p>
<p>"Clang...clang..." The dismissal bell for the third class in the morning rang loudly. A series of heavy footsteps slowly spread from the corridor outside the classroom to the dining hall. In less than three minutes, the deserted cafeteria was flooded with a tidal wave of people, breaking through the dull air. Thunder-like footsteps continuously rushed into the eardrums, crashing in head-on, going to each person's designated seat and sitting down with a thud.</p>
<p>"Ding da... ding da..." The sound of knocking bowls densely covered the surroundings of the cafeteria, as if beating war drums. The dining hall seemed like a battlefield, and the situation was very serious. If it were not for the school servants serving rice to the students table by table, perhaps this terrible sound wave would not stop.</p>
<p>Four pots and two bowls of rich dishes, two vegetarian and four meat dishes, and snow-white rice grains had become acts of hostility. The students in the hall were all energetic: eyes like lightning, teeth like scissors, chopsticks like raindrops, throats like bamboo tubes, arms like guns: guns loaded with live ammunition, aiming at the enemy. Rice grains began to attack. Hungry flames were burning in their throats. Long, red tongues sent each rice grain, like a prisoner, to headquarters. Rice was discussed. Soldiers of the teeth and generals of the tongue, following the orders of their superiors, carried out a chewing execution on all the prisoners. Sometimes, they would mercifully open a door of convenience and expel the wounded and disabled soldiers from the slaughterhouse, but after all, they were few in number!</p>
<p>Ten minutes of wolfing down food in a mixed battle created terrible carnage: rice grains, bone fragments, vegetable petals, and shell scraps littered the table, reflecting eye-catching and shocking colorfulness.</p>
<p>Finally, with the whole army wiped out, the students walked towards the dormitory, singing triumphant songs.</p>

<p>Three Friends Benevolent Society Initiates Calligraphy and Painting Sale to Donate Funds to the Northeast Volunteer Army. Since the fall of the Northeast, all Chinese people have been filled with resentment. Fortunately, the Northeast Volunteer Army has risen up to sacrifice themselves, repeatedly defeating the rebels. Their isolated loyalty is outstanding, and their achievements are remarkable. However, the Volunteer Army lacks funding and equipment, making it difficult to sustain their efforts. The future of the nation is in great peril. Recognizing this, the Three Friends Benevolent Society in this city has initiated a calligraphy and painting sale to donate funds to the Northeast Volunteer Army. They are currently soliciting masterpieces from renowned calligraphers and painters nationwide. From October 1st to 10th, they will hold an exhibition at the Literary Department of the Lilih Company on Sijing Road and the Fine Arts Appreciation Society at No. 30 Hualong Road. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army to purchase weapons and recover lost territory. This is truly a benevolent act, and everything is in progress. It is reported that the organizing committee includes Chen Xiaodie, Jian Shoujian, Tie Jiang, Xiao Xie, Meng Li, Li Zu Han, Sun Xuenie, and Xue Baolun, Tang Gongqiu, and other eight people.</p>
<p>Reply Letter to Mr. Zhang Chengmin: I recently received your letter and am deeply honored by your inquiry. I originally intended to reply to you directly, but I feared that other readers might have similar questions, so I am replying in this publication as follows: You wish to study dyeing but lack good books. I believe that there are none available in our country. The best one is a Japanese publication called "Theoretical and Applied Modern Dyeing Methods," which is rich in content and perfect for study. I wonder if there is a translated version in our country; this is a question. Other groups are far less advanced in dyeing than Japan. (2) Naphtol dyes, Agorellin dyes, and Indanthrene dyes are all available in dye shops and can be purchased everywhere. (3) The procedures for dyeing cannot be described in a letter; there are many specific methods that cannot be explained with abstract words. The aforementioned book "Modern Dyeing Methods" should have everything you need to read. I offer the above three points for your consideration. I hope you find them satisfactory. Rui Yucheng, September 24.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Pays Attention to the Decline of the World's Automobile Industry</h3>
<p>Yu</p>
<p>Orders Experts to Study Revival Methods</p>
<p>Although the global automobile manufacturing industry has been showing a gradual upward trend, a closer examination reveals a less optimistic picture compared to the boom years of the previous two years. Even the United States, traditionally a global leader in automobile manufacturing, has experienced a significant decline. In 1929, the global output was estimated at six million vehicles, but in 1930, it plummeted to four million vehicles, representing a decrease of 34.6 percent, which was quite unexpected. Other European automobile manufacturing countries such as Italy, Germany, France, and England have also experienced similar declines. The underlying cause can be summarized as the global economic recession. The automobile industry is a significant enterprise that attracts global attention, and its rise and fall are of concern to the international economic community. Recognizing this, the Economic Committee of the League of Nations recently convened a group of experts to study the production and trade of automobiles in various countries. The study took several months to complete, and the resulting report raised several important questions. The League of Nations will forward these questions to the Permanent International Bureau of Motor Manufacturers for further investigation and research. All of the aforementioned experts are members of this bureau.</p>
<p>The decline and difficulties encountered by the global automobile industry in recent years are undeniable facts. In 1929, the total number of automobiles and freight trailers produced worldwide was six million vehicles. However, in 1930, this figure suddenly dropped by 34.6 percent, with production falling to only four million vehicles. The decline in the United States during this period was even more significant, reaching a staggering 37.6 percent. However, this figure also includes Canada. Among European countries, France experienced a decline of 10 percent, Germany a decline of 26.8 percent, and Italy a decline of 20 percent. In 1931, the world's automobile production did not show any signs of recovery, and the total output decreased by another 25 percent compared to 1930. The United States and Canada experienced a decline of 30 percent, while European countries saw a decrease of 21.3 percent in France, 19 percent in Germany, and 37.5 percent in Italy. The decline in England was the smallest, with a decrease of only 1 percent in 1930, which increased to 4.3 percent in 1931. Although the aforementioned figures seem significant, the actual performance was due to effective support measures. Otherwise, the decline would have been even greater.</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce of America, the export of automobiles from the United States decreased by 44 percent in 1931 compared to 1930. This phenomenon was common among automobile manufacturing countries, except for Germany. Germany's automobile exports accounted for approximately 6 percent of the total in 1929-1930, but this figure jumped to 14.7 percent in 1931. However, the increase in value was far less than the increase in quantity, due to the decline in selling prices and the popularity of small cars. The value of small cars exported in 1931 was only 50 percent of the value of passenger cars exported in 1930.</p>
<p>According to American statistics, the number of automobiles in use worldwide in 1931 was 35,700,000. However, 50 percent of the countries worldwide experienced a decrease in transportation that year, with the following countries experiencing the most significant declines: the United States (558,800 vehicles), Argentina (42,000 vehicles), and Canada (26,800 vehicles). Therefore, it is predicted that the production and sales figures for 1932, except for England, will decrease by as much as 40 percent. England, however, has shown signs of activity in the first few months of this year.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the decline of the automobile industry, the primary factor is the severe impact of the economic recession. This situation is almost universal in all countries. The direct impact of the economic recession on the automobile industry is the weakening of the public's purchasing power. The weakening of purchasing power is also affected by the strong sales of used cars and low-power cars. As for automobiles used in industry, the production and sales situation is relatively balanced. According to reports from various countries, governments often impose additional taxes on automobile users, which further exacerbates the situation. The use of various methods by railway companies to compete with automobiles also dealt a blow to the automobile industry. After this research and discussion, the experts agreed that if measures are to be taken to save the decline of the automobile industry, the most important issues are taxation and tariff protection. They also suggested that the League of Nations invite the Permanent International Bureau to conduct specialized academic research to find a thorough solution. Therefore, they also indicated that they would instruct the Economic Committee to regularly report on the progress of this research.</p>

<h3>A Note on the British-Made Ford Car</h3>
<p>— Xia Tang</p>
<p>Equipped with Eight Horsepower</p>
<p>The "Motor" review states that the eight-horsepower Ford car exhibited at the Albert Hall in London attracted more public interest than any previous car. This new car has undergone several innovations, and the current British-made Dagenham-style new car is vastly different in manufacturing methods and appearance from those previously shipped directly from American factories. There were several points of criticism regarding the cars manufactured in American factories, including the narrow space in the passenger compartment compared to British-made cars, and the difficulty in maneuvering freely in the engine area. All of these shortcomings were eagerly sought to be improved by car manufacturers. The eight-cylinder Ford of today has been completely improved and has become an "outstanding" small car that is almost impossible to find fault with.</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes one about the new car is the greatly improved style. Although the original car had many attractive features, it was difficult to avoid being criticized for being short and stubby. After this thorough reform, the previous shortcomings have been swept away, and the moving lines are revealed without reservation. The style of the rear of the car has also been completely improved. A metal enclosure protects the rear fuel tank and forms the same angle as the tips of the rear fenders. At first glance, this enclosure does not seem to be related to the whole, but in fact, it is very close to the inner edge of the fenders, making it particularly harmonious.</p>
<p>The mudguards have also been greatly reformed and are very effective. The front fenders are different from the previous straight ones and are now sloped backward to harmonize with the rear fenders. The front fenders also have a curved shape, which, in addition to providing effective mud protection, further enhances the overall appearance of the car and increases its aesthetic appeal. The metal enclosure and fuel tank at the rear of the car are also well-matched, greatly enhancing the viewing pleasure. The entire car is equipped with five lights. The windscreen is equipped with an electric wiper. The dashboard is very simple and has a fuel gauge, odometer, lights, and starter switch. The car's springs are transversely cut from end to end. The wheels and tires are exquisite. In addition to the exquisite wheels, the spokes are electrically welded. A spare wheel is installed at the rear of the car, which is deeply recessed into the rear wall and is very close to the enclosure.</p>
<p>The reforms on the entire car's mechanism have also been painstaking, and every effort has been made to achieve excellence. The position of the carburetor and the transporter of the previous-style car was not very desirable. The latter was mostly installed behind the water tank. To avoid these shortcomings, the new car spent a great deal of money on design to achieve perfection. As a result, the fuel tank was moved from the bottom of the car to the rear body. There were also many other changes in the mechanism.</p>
<p>When the car first appeared, the manufacturer claimed that its speed was 55 miles per hour. This provision was proven to be correct when tested at Brooklands. During its initial half-mile run, its speed was 54.55 miles per hour. Its maximum speed was 57 miles per hour. With limited engine power, such a result is not easy to achieve. The test drive was smooth and without any noticeable jerks. Even the shift from slow gear to fast gear was unremarkable. In the second</p>
