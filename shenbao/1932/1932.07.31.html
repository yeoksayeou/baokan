<h3 id="c1">渥太華會議　徵 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>舉世矚目·之英帝國經濟會議。已於本月二十一日在渥太華開幕矣。此會議所討論者。雖爲英帝國内部問題。然其性質之重要。殊不亞於法國提倡之歐洲聯邦。美國提倡之汎美同盟。或且過之。蓋處此經濟恐慌普遍世界之時代。各國爲力圖自救起見。方亟欲聯合他邦以造成經濟同盟。獨英帝國内本屬一體之各自治領各植民地。反有與母國日形背離之傾向。其非大英帝國前途之福。固無待言。至如何可以挽回此種頽勢以謀切實合作。乃英國政治家所日夜焦慮之事。亦即英帝國經濟曾議之所由召集也。</p>
<p>英帝國會議原不自今年始。其議題本以政治爲主。不僅限於經濟。但一九三零年之帝國會議。正當經濟恐慌十分嚴重之時期。故其議題遂側重於經濟。本年會議。爲前次會議之延續。其議題亦全屬經濟方面。最重要者。將仍爲英帝國内之特惠關稅問題。特惠關稅者。即帝國内之相互貿易。其輸入關稅應較與國外貿易者爲低。或竟免稅是也。而特惠關稅之究極。即爲英帝國内之自由貿易。以理而論。英國欲造成經濟的單體。固非撤除帝國内各部分間之貿易障害不可。然在實行上。却不免發生種種困難。如穀物關稅即其一例。一九二九年英帝國輸出小麥總量計達五百八十萬噸。但其中輸入英本國者僅二百萬噸。其餘三百八十萬噸悉皆輸出他國。而英本國反由外國輸入小麥至三百五十萬噸之多。此三百五十萬噸之小麥。英國固無須由國外輸入而可得之于帝國内者。然欲拒絕國外之輸入。勢非增加關稅不可。關稅增加則小麥價格亦隨之增加。其結果無異增加消費者之負担。更進一步言之。英本國所需要之小麥。即令全部取給于帝國國内。然尙有三十萬噸之過剩額。此過剩小麥。若欲傾銷于國外。更非减低價格不可。而國内消費者則永不能享受此再度廉價之小麥焉。</p>
<p>其次英國之特惠關稅。更與自治領之保護關稅政策根本衝突。蓋英商國内之日各自治領。因其政治經濟並行發達之故。國内財源莫不取之于關。稅且爲保護其新興之工商業。更進一步而採取積極的保護關稅政策。觀于戰後世界各國之採保護關稅者多爲英自治領。尤以澳洲加那大最爲急進。可以明瞭。此等自治領果願爲母國之利益。犧牲其政策而實行特惠關稅乎。亦一極大之疑問也。</p>
<p>因特惠關稅之實行。有種種之困難故一九三○年之英帝國經濟會議。雖作詳密之研究。卒無具體的决定。僅聲明現存特惠稅率繼續三年。而將主要問題延至本年渥太華會議再加討論。故此次會議之議題。大都爲前次會議所遺下。此可以斷言者也。</p>
<p>然則此次會議。對於各項問題果有解决方法乎。鑒於會議開幕以前出席各代表之言論。似頗具有决心。力求會議之成功。然小麥問題旣如前述。未易解决。而在他方。印度與愛爾蘭。皆爲英帝國重要之分子。今印度國民運動正達高潮。愛爾蘭又與英本國發生爭端。能否引入英帝國特惠關稅之圈内更屬疑問。而對於許多非自治領地之植民地。應施行如何辦法。亦爲不易决定之問題準此而觀。則會議前途尙未可遽抱樂觀也。</p>
<p>最後應述及者。爲英帝國内之通貨問題。此問題雖與特惠關稅無直接關係。但因今日現金集中於美法二國。發生金貴銀賤之風潮。如銀價未能恢復其原來之地位。則廣大之亞洲市塲。將永失其購買能力。縱令英帝國内築成特惠關稅之安全地帶。而英帝國商品。不能銷往國外。於英國經濟繁榮之恢復。究有甚大之阻碍。故會議中擬討論採用兩金屬幣制。案實與我國有重要之關係。此則我人應加以注意者也。</p>

<p>産業界不景氣不堪重征</p>
<p>藏相主張限制發行公債</p>
<p>軍閥一意孤行表示反對</p>
<p>華聯社卅日東京電昨日之内閣會議席上、高橋藏相提議謂日本之非常時機、大約可於三年間結束、今次之臨時國會、政府須提出今　三年間所欲發之公債總額、如國會通過後即按年分發、不得超出所定範圍、日本之不景氣狀態、不堪重征、祗公債政策一途耳、如不限制、將來公債之增即無法制止、且不易維持其市價、但其餘閣員均未表同意、據政界某要人談、高橋所提之公債限制案、其目的在限制侵華軍費之繼續增加、間接即使軍部不能再擴大侵華軍事行動之範圍、而軍部之反對亦即在此、軍部籌劃進攻華北聲中、高橋財長之提案實堪注目、足見日本資本家與軍閥之意志爲如何矣、</p>
<p>路透二十六日東京通訊藏相高橋力圖使下届財政年之預算、收入相抵、但對於籌欵辦法頗爲困難、高橋持下列理由、認爲發行公債較增稅爲佳、（一）或有主張提高所得稅者、但日本國内有鉅大收入者甚少、且商業公司多由少數總公司管理、故提高所得稅率、難增收入、（二）尙有主張增加證劵稅率者、但此將使流動資本减少、而經濟狀况將愈趨惡劣、日政府近迭採取步驟、制止資金外溢、如增加證劵稅率、於原則上適爲相反、高橋雖作此見解、但其僚屬間頗有與其主張不同者、或謂高橋反對提高所得稅之理由、僅指鉅大收入而言、但際此國家財政緊急之秋、對於中等或低級收入、亦應仿效英美辦法、增加稅率、如徒賴惜欵度日、縱將來國家恢復繁榮、然債欵纍纍、亦難清償云、日國會或將於八月底召集特别會議、討論財政辦法、</p>

<h3 id="c86">滿洲僞長官駒井辭職内幕丨南光丨 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>日人官吏貪汚瀆職者被攻擊</p>
<p>籠絡馬占山將軍政策告失敗</p>
<p>彼此暗鬥主張歧異左右爲難</p>
<p>財政困難應付乏術徒喚奈何</p>
<p>一、駒井將向東京請辭職</p>
<p>滿洲僞國太上皇、乃僞國國務院總務長官駒井德三、昨日之東京電報、傳駒井定日内抵東京、對日内閣提出辭職書、後任擬薦丸山鶴吉繼之、查駒井之辭職、曾於六月中喧騰一次、後經傀儡要人之勸勉、隨即取消、但其内容、日方均不敢發表、據吾人所得之消息、其主要原因有三、一爲日人官吏之對立、二爲財政問題之複雜、三爲對付義勇軍之方略、茲分項目、詳述於左、</p>
<p>二、日貪官汚吏瀰滿東北</p>
<p>僞國内之日本官吏、互相暗鬥對立抗爭者、約有三種、一爲文治派與點武派之對立、二爲循吏與汚吏之對立、三爲法西斯蒂黨與自由主義黨之對立、統計滿洲僞國之僞中央政府各機關中、共有日人官吏百五十餘人、至地方機關及新劫奪之海關鹽務郵政、與從前之中國國營鐵路各處、近亦漸次安插日人、其數目日有增加、不能確知其詳、惟日官中因其背景所薦機關之大小、靠山之强弱、常彼此明爭暗鬥、各逞其能、尤其是軍閥所薦之人、最爲驕横、此次東北事變、事事靠軍部力量、開展日人在東北之局勢、因此發生文治派與　武派對立之導因、且軍部之意、以爲滿洲僞組織、應隸屬關東總督、不必再爲諱飾、乘此機會、單刀直入、以殖民地覊縻之、文官方面、則主張不應即行抛棄其假面具、外表仍倡尊重華人之口號、以冀减低國際之反感、故一方面雖以日本利益爲前提、亦不敢酷待華人、且恐華人突生變故、於日人有損無益、結果必將欲速不達、棄其名、取其實、乃爲上計、奈急進之軍人、始終反對此種主張、此爲文武派之對立也、</p>
<p>其次爲汚吏與循吏之抗爭、原來在東北日軍所薦之日官、多爲日本軍部年來所用之無賴浪人即所謂滿洲浪人或支那通是也、小人得志無惡不作、理所必然、自九一八事變以來、日軍嘉獎及眷念彼輩年來在華搗亂之功績、及欲利用其所謂支那通之特長、極力薦給僞國、分任顯要官職、此輩行檢不修、貪劣成性、平日旣在華藉其本國之勢力、販毒禍滿、倚勢凌人、又慣於花天酒地之生活、除略諳中國國情、陰報本國外、並無絲毫應世之經綸、聞自僞國登台以來、長春之日人酒家八千代、（即酒家兼堂子）、統計其消費、一夜在數萬元以上、均爲僞國日官嫖客之豪舉所開消者、且日官登台後、各地日人酒家、均告客滿、此可爲日官貪汚放蕩剝削民膏之鐵證、此猶未足以盡僞國日官貪汚之實情、茲復舉其一二顯要官吏之苛歛情形、以爲國人告、如哈爾濱船政局日顧問堀井、就官以來、未及三月、剝削已達十數萬元、僞外長謝介石登台、亦未及三月、羅掘竟達百餘萬元、謝呂西爲熱河代表、未及月餘、亦囊括至十二餘萬元、此爲最顯間之實例、此種貪汚、多爲駒井總務長官一人所庇縱、或監督不周而成、稍爲安分之官吏、恐連累受嫌、極不滿意彼等之行爲、暗爲指責者頗多、於是又成對立之勢、此東京方面、早欲諷其辭職之内容也、</p>
<p>三籠絡馬占山失敗</p>
<p>僞官要店保四人</p>
<p>駒井辭職之内容、除上面所述外、則爲負責籠絡馬占山將軍政策之失敗日軍閥本自始至終、即主張以武力解决馬占山、乃駒井等之文官派、則主張以收買政策籠絡馬將軍、並謂否則日軍將受重大犧牲、軍部曲從之、乃派謝介石與馬將軍會見、馬將軍經數次會商後、爲忍小辱以就大謀計、竟詐降於日、往哈埠謁見本莊、參加本莊圖立滿國之計劃、及得其秘密後、又復與本莊宣告斷絕關係、并將其秘密宣佈於世、日軍閥甚恨駒井之失策、攻擊甚烈、駒井於六月中提出辭意、其原因即在於此、實則出於一時之憤激而然耳、從此日軍閥與文官派之意見、愈背道而馳、軍閥及滿洲浪人、以爲滿洲國是日本之屬地、事事須聽從日人、尤須由日軍閥指揮、駒井等文官派、則戴假面具、力倡滿洲國是整個獨立國、不可横加干涉、亦不可以日人獨占其機關、啓國際之惡感、且謂如日人視滿洲國爲屬地、難保不無馬占山第二之反日領袖繼續出現、因之多方阻止、日軍閥甚惡之、但是時僞國傀儡顯官暗中甚恨日軍人之氣燄迫人、羣起擁護駒井、藉以維持彼輩一時之顔面、日軍部雖甚不滿於駒井、惟因環境尙未成熟、恐内部自起破裂、發生惡果、故表面上仍勸駒井勉爲其難、第自此以後、日軍部之監視僞國官吏、轉加嚴厲、茲引僞外交部官員任職一事爲證、可見一斑、近有某氏在僞外部服務書記、須倩四人舖保、　其在職中不反日、退職後不離東省往中國本土、如有違背、擔保人連坐其責、方能錄用、他如科長·警察署長·或團長旅長之左右、均有所謂日人顧問者監視之、凡事非經日顧問之簽字、不能實行、因此僞官對日本軍閥挾怨甚深、惟處此情勢下、無可奈何而已、倘若日俄事起、或國府派兵收回失地、彼等必將倒戈反正、響應國軍、因此文官與軍閥之爭執愈深、駒井之處理益難、此又駒井之不得不提出辭職也、</p>
<p>四財政已到山窮水盡</p>
<p>口仁慈而政行搜括</p>
<p>東三省自上年九一八事變以後、戰爭作亂、未嘗一日停、滿地烽烟砲火、城邑丘墟、人民慘死、五穀歉收、全土皆然、幾成一片地獄矣、日人爲籠絡人民計、乃令傀儡官吏、到處宣傳其薄稅歛行王道政治、以掩飾其武力所造成千孔百瘡之狀况、然人民仍多抗納租稅、因此僞國之財政、已到山窮水盡、而軍費一項、旣日益增多、民衆抗日感情、又日益加厚、此外各地業産又爲日人所佔、官衙之職位、亦爲日人所奪、由上而下、反日之情勢、醞釀益盛、苟再無法應付現狀、則東北之僞組織、去壽終正寢之途不遠矣、僞組織於此、爲欲應付財政難局、乃拚命要求日政府承認僞組織、然後簽定條約、拍賣江山、求日本借欵、以救目前之危、實則日人對此財政危機、日軍閥之主張與文治派之主張、多所出入、此亦爲駒井不得不提出辭職之一因、由此觀察、便知僞國之危機四伏、即以財政問題言之、日本政府自顧不暇、焉有能力應付僞國之危局、况内有文武派之對抗、外有義軍之血戰、各地民衆又風起雲湧、自今以後、東北之事、眞不堪問矣、（二一，七，二七，）</p>

<p>— 翰記</p>
<p>有客自巴黎來，吾問他··</p>
<p>（巴黎繁華甲天下，請問在菜館裏喝的湯，最貴的要多少錢？）</p>
<p>客答··（恐怕至多不出五十法郎吧？）　　吾說··（五十法郎未免太便宜了！）　　（那末，一百法郎點一碗，湯恐怕在巴黎要算最貴的湯？）　　客很忸怩地對是說。　　吾連連搖頭，說：　　（還是太便宜！像巴黎這樣繁華的地方，一碗考究的湯僅値一百法郎，實在太便宜了！）</p>
<p>客聞之，橋舌不下，叩以故，吾笑曰：</p>
<p>（一天，志堯（朱志堯先生係相老之賢甥）伴吾出去，到一家菜館裏去小吃，吾坐定了翻開菜單一看，猛見湯類裏有一種湯，名中山湯，價値大洋六百圓，吾看了一嚇，嚇得一呆，呆得連話多說不出來。半晌，吾才連連搖頭，覺得實在太貴了，恐怕這一碗中山湯要算是世界上最貴的湯了！</p>
<p>（後來没有法子，湯終是要喝的，於是在湯類裏點上一碗便宜的湯，也要五塊錢，嘗之，也覺得很無聊，没有多大滋味！）</p>
<p>客聞之，大驚失色，說道：</p>
<p>（像巴黎這樣繁華的地方，吾還没有見過値價五百塊錢的湯，吾看，上海的繁華一日千里，大有巴黎不如上海之槪！　　吾聽了，唯唯不置可否。湯之貴歟？上海之繁華歟？這是吾打</p>

<h3 id="c134">日本的老方法 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>日本旣佔據了整個的滿洲。就差不多軍事時代告終。而入於合併的時代。所謂滿洲國不過是緩和國際間緊張注意的一種巧計。在日人心理上。是巴不得早早合併。所以近一月來。統一四頭政治運動。與攫奪鹽稅關稅及郵權的得動。同時並進。等到四頭政治統一。鹽關郵都攫到了手。僞滿洲國的命運。也便到了没落時期。絕對不會延長多久。除非我政府有武力收回的决心。趁着現在義勇軍遍佈東北的時候。毅然出兵東北。則日人合併滿洲的迷夢。纔或不至於圓成。現在日政府統一四頭政治。不是收决定設置全權府或統監府於滿洲。並日以統監府一說爲有力麽。這正是合併朝鮮的老方法。要來對滿洲如法泡製。人們略一回憶。便覺朝鮮之亡於統監府。歷歷如在目前。因爲過去得並不多久。就是日俄戰爭之後。朝鮮完全變爲日本的府庸。日本即乘機將駐剳朝鮮的公使館撤廢。重置一統監府。總攬朝鮮一切外交内政。可是是本人心腸絕辣。仍不以爲滿足。没多時更藉端朝鮮國王密遣使人求援海牙和平會議。更迫朝鮮承認下列各條件。（一）統監有指導朝鮮政府施政之權。（二）關於朝鮮之法令行政。須經統監認可。（三）黜陟高等官吏。須經統監同意。（四）統監得推薦日本人爲朝鮮官吏。由朝鮮政府任命之。（五）非經統監同意。不准聘用外國人。其後因安重根在哈爾濱之一擊。日本又在朝鮮境内增了兩萬名警察。於是在清宣統二年八月二十二日。便産生了（进鮮將全部統治權永遠讓與日本）的合併條約。這就是日本在合併朝鮮以前設置統監府的。經過略史。我們看罷。現在日本與僞國間。對於上述五項條件。是缺了那一項。就是警察。也何嘗没有兩萬名在滿洲境内。現在的滿洲。和宣統二年以前的朝鮮。完全一式一樣。就祗是缺一統監府。（其實不過名義不同。事實的統監府是早已有了。）一旦實行設置。則合併的要素。已無一不具。僅時間問題而已。諸位叛逆還在醉生夢死。甘爲傀儡。豈不大可哀哉。</p>

<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>淞滬亂作。鄕人之逃還者。日以千百計。流離瑣尾。狼狽不堪言狀。一日。予待客於慈谿車站。見一少年。軍裝革履。風度翩翩。旁立一妙齡女子。掩巾啜泣。喃喃不審作何辭。少年姿態軒昻。口淡巴菰。莞爾謂女子曰。速去休。速去休。毋溷乃公。女子曰。汝去冬赴錦州投義勇軍。同行者二百七十餘人。不死於砲火。即死於嚴寒。今旣生還。何忍抛妻别子重入槍林彈雨之中乎。吾家有負郭之田如干畝。粗可自給。即不爲妾計。獨不思白髮龍鍾之老母乎。昨日聞汝歸來。喜極抱汝大哭。汝今越宿便出。又欲赴滬投入義勇軍。志則壯矣。老母知之。妾其何詞以對也。恐一慟而　。汝縱成無名之英雄。實爲不孝之罪人矣。言已大哭。少年曰。國難臨頭。亦顧不了慈恩私情。予志已决。何呶呶爲。况人必有死。死於牖下。與死於沙塲。直如泰山之與鴻毛。然生死亦有定數。吾本在上海南京路某肆爲夥。月入無慮六七十金。徒以强敵猖獗。國人醉生夢死。每讀日報。令人椎心泣血。於是約同志二百七十餘人。遄赴東北。投入義勇軍。初上戰塲。難免膽怯。久則樂趣陡生。翻以不與敵鏖戰爲索然寡歡矣。陡以東北嚴寒。今生還者祇百十三人。今暴宼野心益肆。竟侵犯淞滬。聞十九路軍又能奮力抵抗。予不去東北。亦當加入淞滬。以與暴宼相周旋。亦國民應盡之天職。汝其善侍吾母。撫若子。他日相見。容圖痛飲也。時汽笛嗚嗚。滬杭甬車已蜿蜒入站。人頭攢動中只。見此義勇少年。一躍上車。揮巾與其妻别也。</p>

<p>醒來已七點，從下關某旅社的窗裏瞧見江心停着四艘飄着外國國旗的軍艦，同時龐大的吳淞號江輪也已興奮地從東面駛來，我是要乘這條船上漢口去的，於是我在匆忙地洗着臉。可怪在洗臉桌的大鏡裏，發現一個女人站在我的身後，妖媚的笑臉是說明了伊的來意我亟回頭問伊（做點什麽來）？伊並没回答，祇是從手提籃裏揀了兩朶白蘭花給我聞，）買</p>
<p>兩枝香香吧，出門人是用得着的），說時，伊那富有蠱惑性的豐滿的胸脯是漸漸地將和我靠近了，於是我不得不嚴正地說：（你别來歪纒，我馬上要搭船的，你不看看什麽人在這兒？去你的吧）！於是伊滿不高興地走了，可是伊仍然要帶着笑臉走到另一個房間裏去的。當伊走出房門的時候，我好像在伊背上看見：（可憐我賣花的人靠賣花是活不了的）。</p>

<p>江輪啟椗，我已在第二號的房艙裏，送行人在碼頭上悵望着船，江風是一陣陣地吹進船艙</p>
<p>來，茶房高聲叫着（機關槍來哉）！猛看時，殊覺可嘆，原來所謂機關槍也者，祇有一尺多長的竹桿，槍口從祇對住槍手的口腔，而放的彈呢！却是眞正的煙幕彈。</p>
<p>這機關槍的開放，引起我對坐客生活作一調查的高興，於是費了一點鐘零五分的時間，得着了如後的一個統計，計開：</p>
<p>打馬將者二十八人　閱報者　十五人</p>
<p>讀雜誌者二人　讀步兵操典者　一人</p>
<p>讀性史者七人（内有婦人一）　洗衣者　二人</p>
<p>相駡者　三人　啃麫包者　一人</p>
<p>吃蠶豆者一人　吹牛者六人</p>
<p>開機關槍者　七十四人（共分佈在二十七個要隘）</p>
<p>唱手扶欄杆小曲者　一人　寫統計表者　一人</p>
<p>附註··表内所列，限於乘客，而乘客中之看江者，談天者，睡覺者，出恭者，復不在内，蓋因不計其數也。</p>
<p>右開數字，以我考察時爲準，過時如有增减，本人槪不負責。</p>
<p>我没有學過統計，所以表格作得很馬虎。</p>
<p>倩萍。男角是鄭小秋。劇情的正軌。是描寫三角戀愛的悲哀。支線是襯托出婚姻制度的錯誤。很平常。可是經步高利用他靈活聰明的手腕導演出來。倒覺得很曲折。很有味。尤其是開明星未有这紀錄的美術化的置景。更使人醒目。不料明星在狂風暴雨公司多事之秋。還會有這般美滿的出品問世。這種沉著鎭靜的態度。也連帶的表現出來了。</p>
<p>臨了。我希望明星以後要多從（新）的上面著力。否則一部部的出品好似機械般轉動是毫無一些生氣的。</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>六十七</p>
<p>（到東北去！）</p>
<p>（把東北拿回來！）</p>
<p>這是古廟從來没有聽過的新的呼聲··這呼聲是從古廟靑年的心靈中發出來的震動了全村人民的耳鼓，透進了全村人民的心窩，致使全村人民都覺得（到東北去），（把東北拿回來）成了一種天經地義，以爲不如此便不能算是中國人並不能算是古廟人。</p>
<p>在長江以南的鄕村，所流傳的格言是··（好鐵不打釘··好男不當兵。）古廟的人何嘗没有受過這種人生觀的麻醉，何以現在不但是贊成人人當兵而且還要與外來暴力在戰塲上周旋？這種心理上變化之線索是不難尋覓古廟人民自從組織了自衛團已經懂得民衆武力之偉大。那些慘撕小孩的土匪不但是不敢再來打刦並且連恐嚇信也不敢再來黏貼了因爲生活敎育的效力民衆不久就從一村想到一國。從古廟的自衛一跳而計畫到全國的自衛</p>
<p>（兩個人太少了，我們一起去！）熱血沸騰的靑年在會塲上幾乎是異口同聲的這樣說。朱先生是費了九牛二虎之力引導我們用冷腦來指揮熱血他說··（古廟出這兩個壯丁你們不要嫌太少，依我看來這兩個人不啻是兩百萬人。古廟的使命是先盡自已的責任，再喚起全國一百萬個村莊去同樣的盡責。假使每個村莊出壯丁二名便得精兵二百萬，可以負起收復東北之使命。我們多出一個人固可算是多盡一分責任，但是同時是減輕了别的村莊的責任。况且我們必須通盤計畫纔能制勝。投軍的村友所留下的田地必須由我們代爲耕種，付托的老幼必須由我們服侍敎養。我們一言旣出，駟馬難追，决不能出空頭支票，以增加衛國戰士之憂慮，所以我主張投効名額暫定二人，將來如有急需再行增加。）　　這兩個人是如何分配呀？用不着推舉。自告奮勇的是有十三人之多。人們</p>
<p>上了他們一個封號，稱他們爲古廟十三太保。這個保字是有廣大的意義。他們所保的是整個的中華民族不是少數人的特殊利益古廟十三太保只能去兩位這倒有些不好辦。有人主張拈　。有人主張以家累最少之兩靑年先去。但結果是十三太保一個也不肯留在家鄕。這是出於朱先生意料之外！朱先生能叫靑年起來，不能叫已經起來的靑年再坐下去。最後朱先生只得犧牲自已的主張，日夜加緊十三太保的訓練以便向東北出發。</p>

<p>昨日函工部局</p>
<p>上海租界納稅華人會昨函公共租界工部局總辦云逕啟者、據上海寳華鞋帽莊函稱、敝號因工部局將巡捕捐改爲銀兩收取事、曾於本月九日致函貴會、請求去函交涉、並於同日致函工部局、促其糾正嗣於十一日奉貴會復函、敬悉已蒙交涉、實深感佩、乃十八日據工部局復函、略謂接貴號七月九日來函、質問本局無故變更收</p>
<p>捐辦法、其實本局仍照向例收取、並未變更、因貴號居住之房屋、係屬洋式、須以銀兩估價、所估之價、爲每月規銀二百八十八兩、每季應納捐銀一百二十兩零九錢六分、洋厘以七錢二分計算、爲免除手續麻煩起見、卽以七錢二分爲永久的禁凖、至收捐時則依當日市價計算、倘遇洋厘跌落、而貴號不願吃虧者、可用規銀付之等語、此種答復完全矛盾之詞、焉能使人折服、敝號所付房租、旣係銀元、（每月洋四百元）應該按照銀元計算、乃該局捨簡就緊、强用銀兩付捐、佔價時旣以七錢二分爲永久的標準、收捐時何又用近日市價（六錢九分）爲臨時的變更、卽退一步論、姑認此種矛盾辦法爲該局所有之權限、然去年洋厘常在七錢二分之外、最高價且近七錢三分、敝號所納之捐洋、若以當日之市價計算、其數當在一百六十八元之内、何以該局每季均收銀元一百六十八元、絕未按照當日市價、亦未提及可用規銀一百廿兩零九錢六分付捐、果如上述、則納稅人祗有負擔一百六十八元額外之損失、而無享受一百六十八元額内之利益、可謂不平甚矣、茲將房票一紙、工部局復函一件附上、務懇再爲賜予交涉、實爲公　等情、並附房票及貴局惠復到會、查該號論點、甚爲有理而充分、而貴局所持理由、未能自圓其說、因不建築公平之上、自難令人折服、洋厘之暴落、貴局以支出多屬銀兩、所受損失自屬不小、然受其損失者商人居户、亦不能例外、且在洋厘騰貴之時、貴局以收取銀元而得其益者、亦屬不資、辦理公共事業、終屬以簡單爲上、由簡就繁、且圖蠅頭之計算、而損人利已、最不相宜、近來廢兩用元之運動、正以防止此種貨幣不定、致人收支常有變化、而謂貴局之高明、未見及此、甚不能信、惟以欲補損失、貴局遂採此種忽此忽彼之政策、其情雖屬可原、其事究失公平、蓋專以便已爲上、究難令人甘心承受也、好在該項租金、以銀元計算、則徴收市面通行之銀元、亦便亦簡、何必輾轉計算、多致紛擾、倘使貴局預算實有不敷之處、自有平衡之法、開源節流、原爲事實所許、設欲謀增收入、支支節節而爲之、或竟使各個納稅人之繁榮、而日就衰敝、則社會之間、苦者漸多、治安上自多問題、恐聚歛而來者、以之彌補日增月加之治安維持費、尙不足也、本會並非好爲之辯、正以愛護公共繁榮之深、故不得不爲言之切也、據函前情、相應函請貴局、對於寳華鞋莊市政總捐、照房租銀元四百元計算、每季仍徴銀元一百六十八元爲荷、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>我最歡迎人家駡，駡得對，我可以借鏡改良，駡得不對,等於鷄鳴犬吠，他們自失人格，亦可置之不睬，我的見解是如此，</p>
<p>昨據報載，國府令各機關，嗣後公務人員，對於政府設施，如認爲不妥,可用書面建議於長官，不得逕自向外發表，違者得分别情由輕重，由主管長官交付懲戒，這是對的，因爲旣是公務人員，對於政府的措施認爲不當時，自可建議於主管長官，請其採用，或請轉呈當局，酌量採納，不必對外發表竟見，　　惟非公務人員，對於政府之措施，認爲不當時，似不必用建議手續，可以自由向外發表，這句話意在言外，不言可知，但政府許人民自由發表意見，原本人民言論自由權之原則，天然，言論自由，其言論有說得對的，也有說得不對的，這是全憑政府意志，如政府認爲說得對的，儘可採用，如認爲不對的，則可置諸不論不議之例，這是見政府光明磊落的態度，</p>
<p>防民之口，甚於防川，古語有云，今則更甚，并且歷古到今，政府防口之手段，可說用盡，試問那一朝那一代發生了效力，還有一層，防口猶易，防心更難，口雖不言，心實反對，如何防得</p>
<p>了呢，再有一層，倘公然自由發表意見，到是一個心直口快的人，其言雖戇，其心無他，譬如遇犬，若見人影，牢牢而吠，其犬一定不兇，最恐怕的，其先一無表示，一到走近，躍出狂噬，這眞是可怕哩。</p>
<p>語曰惟善人能受盡言，所以能受盡言，也是不容易，非有大公無我的態度·虚懷若谷的心胸，一聞逆耳之言，不免就要（怒從心上起惡向膽邊生）了，所以古人說，惟善人能受盡言。</p>

<p>— 引震</p>
<p>（一）避電針的裝置避電針的裝置很簡單，在屋頂裝置上端尖銳的金屬柱，拿粗銅絲連起來，在地下濕的地方埋放一塊銅板，這銅板和粗銅絲連接起來，這樣的裝置，就是避電針的裝置。</p>
<p>（二）避電針避電的理由在雷雨的時候，地面所生的感應電，由尖端作用慢慢地放散在空中，因此這房屋不致受劇烈的電擊。</p>
<p>（三）避電針應用的原理電的分布祗限於導體（金屬類物所起的電極易移動者）的表面且變曲的地方，比平坦的地方帶電多，故愈尖的柱帶電亦愈多，因尖端有多量的電，則柱的四周的物質先被吸引，最後被拒斥。（一）因此帶電體所有電量，逐漸失散，這是叫尖端作用，避電針就是應用尖端作用的原理，而製成的一種保安的器具。（一）就是電的性質同性相斥異性相吸。</p>
<p>（四）避電針的效用避電針裝在屋上以後，每當雷雨的時候，電光雷聲在很劇烈的時候，旁邊附近的房屋人畜都要受到雷擊，裝避電針的一家，就能避去這種的危險，所以避電針也屬於保安器具的一部分，現在時當夏令，正用得到這種東西，所以貢獻給諸位。</p>

<p>在普通人家，一間厨房，有四五個人家拚用，東一飯籃西一竹橱，菜啦，魚啦，米啦，肉啦，狼藉滿地，臭氣　鼻，令人作惡，最不衛生的，往往厨房之外，便是小便之處·丨往往在自來水管之旁，淘米洗菜，也是這裏丨仔細想來，豈不齷齪，豈不有害，海上餐館·往往小便之處，與燙酒之處，十分接近，眞是令人欲嘔，在内地，柴間，坑厠，又每與厨房做高隣，一則易於失火，一則易傳病菌，這等初看雖是小事，其實所關極大，所以在下提出來這個改良厨房的建議，</p>
<h3 id="c223">關於兒童玩具的建議 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 伊農</p>
<p>我輩靑年的個性，皆於兒童時代養成，而兒童的個性，更密關其玩具，我國一般愚夫愚婦，莫不以蟲魚鳥獸洋囝囝等類之玩具餉其兒童，此種玩具實徒耗金錢，而對兒童的身心毫無利益，况此類玩具的來源，多出自我國的世仇丨日本呢！</p>
<p>我嘗見西方兒童，除極幼之女孩外，絕對不玩洋囝囝等類的玩具，他們所玩的，就是本國製的小刀斧與小發動機，他們利用這種玩具，更能自製種種小玩具，此種精神誠令人驚嘆，</p>
<p>木製的刀槍劍戟，是我國純國粹式的玩具，此種玩具，一般摩登人們，必譏其爲野蠻化，實則以此餉兒童，最能養成其尙武精神，正可革除我國人民委靡不振之氣，</p>
<p>至於小康之家，可購西洋製之玩具，如小汽槍小引擎之類，餉其兒童，此種玩具，更能使小孩的頭腦科學化，使他們將來成爲科學化有用的靑年，</p>
<p>余有幼弟二人，而余歷年所與之玩具，僅木刀數柄及價廉之小汽槍二支而已，余即利用此種玩具，授之以初步國術與淺近的軍事知識，余不敢自信此爲得計，但至少總不至如玩一切無意識的玩具那般無利益吧！</p>
<p>總之玩具的選擇，影響兒童的將來至大，今謹以此建議，願本會諸同仁加以商榷焉，</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>朋友，你到過北火車站没有？那末你對於那裏的一切留心過没有？否則我便告訴你一椿怪事。哈哈，那眞是我們貴中國所特有的怪事。··噢？你不相嗎？且慢且慢，且聽我細細道來。</p>
<p>朋友！北站是被敵人燒成敗瓦頽垣，可是在除了路警之外復有武裝警察大隊（維持秩序），却和戰前没有二樣。他們旣是威風也是堂皇！</p>
<p>天氣還早，一個破衣　　的老頭子挑着担子趕了上來，因爲火車便要開駛，當然他得忽忙；可是他在警察的吆喝之下停住脚步了，於是縛得牢牢的繩子</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>命令解開了，在所謂（檢查）的執行之</p>
<p>下，於是這老兒的什物得一樣一樣的被抛在地上了。這樣的翻了文翻，檢了又檢，　然這老頭兒因着火車快要開駛而再三請求饒恕，可是始終等着火車步了而這裏還没完成。</p>
<p>那末以後怎樣呢？哈哈，朋友！那眞是有趣，這些警察老爺們雖然查不到任何違禁物，可是其中有一位却將兩個價値一百文的麵包拿在鼻頭邊嗅了一嗅然後不客氣的送往嘴裏咀嚼起來。砹！朋友！你想：這是甚麽行爲？這簡直是攔路打刦哩。</p>
<p>當然那被刦者只能瞠目無語。然而，朋友！這正是我們貴國的維持治安的政績哩。</p>

<p>— 淵白</p>
<p>Ｘ校的前校長榮登天國之後，外國人足足費了三個月的工夫，好容易請到一位博士先生來任校長，當時同學們的確有些詫異，Ｘ校是敎會設立的學校，一切學校行政都由外國敎士掌理的，校長不過是一塊神主牌罷了，而博士來長該校，以他的學位說來，做中學校的走狗式的校長，未免太可惜了，不過他也許不似已故的學士校長了，或許他具有辦敎育的决心，切實地把敎會學校改革一下，也未可知，這是他未上任前我輩同學的猜測。</p>
<p>他就職的當兒，就接見我們畢業級的同學，當時我們以數百同學切望着的立案問題，探詢他的意見，並請求他作速解决，他就像煞有介事地說，（不錯，···立案是形色上的，···唔，我也主張即時立案，不過Ｘ師和Ｘ師母都執意不立案，所以只得慢慢地進行，苟其市敎育局認眞做事，把不立案的學校封閉起來，那末立案問題就不難解决了，）唔，他長校的目的，並非在改善學校，却希望Ｘ校的末運降臨，並非在開導頑固的西敎士，却去奉順他們，這是他給我們最初的印象。</p>
<p>他上任以後，Ｘ校中新添了一位穿西裝提皮包忙碌地跑來跑去的足跡，校政方面，除故意停職了一位敎務長，而聘請一位和校長同鄕而又姓的先生任敎務長外，又拖了一羣同鄕來任敎職，學生有所要求，總以（西敎士執意如此，我也没有辦法，）這樣輕易地放過了，或許博士自以爲大才小用吧，以致把救國運動也忽略了，或竟連九一八事件都忽略了，專以奉順外國人的校長丨這位博士，爲了他的忽略視事，竟發生了</p>
<p>停辦的把戲。</p>
<p>可是他的好處也當讚揚讚揚，不該遽爾没煞的，他對於宗敎事業，格外熱心，很爲西敎士所讚美，所以Ｘ關門大吉之後，他就榮任了敎會書店的職員，（却酬）</p>

<p>— 白洪</p>
<p>朋友Ｔ君已經失業半年多了，他每天只買些大餅油條充充饖，有時候，連買大餅油條的錢也没有，便索性睡起來不吃，他一天一天的想着，總希望時局太平的時候，立刻就能找到一個糊口的</p>
<p>位置。但是啊，事實告訴他没有希望，最近連帮助他活下去的Ａ君也失了業了！</p>
<p>前天他們寫信來說，已經三四天得不到食物了，要找Ｂ君設法，但Ｂ君自己已經到了山窮水盡的年頭，他接到信長嘆一聲，便坐在那兒獻默無語。</p>
<p>在這饖餓得可怕的年　，不幸Ａ君又生了病　據說病很重，已經没有什麽希望。自然，窮得連飯也没得吃，那裏還請得起醫生，只好由他死去。</p>
<p>那一羣没有死，而爲窮困所磨難的人，他們隨時都有死的可怕。近來失業的人愈遇愈多，没有失業的也到了破産的時代，總之，大家都走上了死路，這究竟是誰造成的啊！（這完全是不抵抗主義造成的恐怖時代！）Ｔ君有一天來信，憤憤的說，（如果要我們出關上前綫打杖，那末我們死也無恨，可是把我們活活的餓死，死也不會瞑目啊！）</p>
<p>可不是麽，現在關稅被刧了，郵政被刦了，熱河危急了，平津動搖了，閙得一榻糊塗，國家早已到了破産時期，老百姓自然不必說。照這樣下去，各國不必派遣一兵一卒，也用不着什麽達姆達姆，烟幕砲，兵艦，飛機，只要派幾個文縐縐的文官，大家來共管中國財政，中國便亡了。日本的出兵，似乎是多事。</p>
<p>可是，在這樣危亡的年頭，大多數的國民仍然泰然自得的過他的生活，靑年們照例進影戲院，跳舞塲，閙戀愛，無知識的民衆們，他們雖然走上了死路，也只嘆幾聲自已命苦。中國人對中國人，一言不合，便會以老拳相待。但是被外國人打了一巴掌，非但不回手，而且恭恭敬敬的陪以微笑。</p>
<p>咳！這年頭兒到處都是表現着走上亡國的死路，死路！</p>

<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>阿四嫂每一次從上海回到鄕下的時候，穿的是新式旗袍，頭髮剪得整齊而光滑，玲瓏的手錶，閃爍的金耳環，尤其是値得人們注意啊！</p>
<p>誰都羨慕她在上海，傭工有這樣的快樂和漂亮啊！</p>
<p>金寳是羨慕最熱烈的一個，常常在夜裏做她理想中的夢。</p>
<p>她好多次要求她的父母說：（要跟阿四嫂到上海去傭工）但是：她的父母總是不應許，並且勸他道：（你靑靑的年紀，懂得什麽？上海是萬惡的淵藪，不去的好！）可是：虚榮在人們心中鑽着，魔力是怎樣的偉大，竟然：被她想出了一個法兒。</p>
<p>（阿四嫂！我想跟你到上海去傭工，但是我的父母不應許，請你在我父母面前保舉一下吧！）當阿四嫂在鄕下的時候金寳向她說：</p>
<p>固然；金寳的父母聽見阿四嫂保舉他的女兒，並且盡力的照拂，金錢是人人愛的，所以金寳的父母也就應許金寳跟阿四嫂到上海去傭工了！</p>
<p>金寳在上海的堂子中傭工已有三年了，她的父母因爲她的嫁期近了，好多次託阿四嫂催他回去，可是：她在慾的環境中早已有了戀人，所以屢次游言推托，不願回去，她的父母那裏知道呢！</p>
<p>因爲她的嫁期迫切了，她的父親不得不特地到上海找她。看見她已經不是三年前鄕下的她了，穿的是時式旗袍，辮子也付之并州了，高跟的皮鞋，拭得光亮鑑人，却已變了一個摩登女子。當然；在女子變態的程中，可以見到她們的節操丨金寳也是變態的一個她的父親怎樣的驚惑！强她速回。</p>
<p>金寳在出嫁一星期後，却發生了失蹤。</p>
<p>（金寳的娘！昨天阿四嫂不是去找金寳的嗎？這一定是阿四嫂的鬼計了，在鄕中幾椿同樣的事，也一定是她趕的了，她專門引誘着鄕間的女子，飽滿她的財慾。唉！可惡的阿四嫂呀！不應把我可愛的金寳騙··了··）金寳的父親帶哭地說··</p>

<p>咏新是個很聰明，很愛文學的靑年，他僅僅十七歲，已經在高中畢業了，這次和我來滬投考大學，暇時只在寓裏溫課讀報，不到半月，他已記得不少的新文學上面的新奇詞句，</p>
<p>最近他給祖父肅奉一禀：</p>
<p>（祖父大人膝下敬禀者：上海的大學，拆爛汚的眞不少，前天密士忒張告訴我（上海Ｋ大學的男女學生，天天只知講究摩登化，課也不上，不是找個密士開開心，便是和密司王的黑漆板凳借張派司到法國公園去白相白相，或是邀集一班同志，跑到海濱去游泳，同時在野外辟克匿克，玩的不亦樂乎，才會翻開書本，讀半個Page，便要叫苦死了，遇到大考的塲合，好在朋友多，派司得法，仍舊答得滿卷，老師留情，没有不派司的，）像這樣的大學，眞是悞人子弟孫絕對不去考牠，···）</p>
<p>他祖父接到此信，氣得鬍子直豎，讀子幾十遍，不知孫子說的還是囈語還是放的狗屁，拿起筆也寫了一封大加叱責的手諭··</p>
<p>（···讀來禀，滿紙油腔滑調，不知究作何解，汝已中疫發囈語耶，摩登化化出狗耶，鼠耶，黑漆板凳坐具也，有何物出借，派司又屬何種怪物，尤奇者同一派司二字，詞意均不可聯合，來禀重用三次，意均似有不同，塲合似作（時光）（時候）解，何不直用本字，必易以塲合耶，汝年輕姑赦汝一次，若再如此胡閙，滿紙荒唐，决不宥汝···）</p>
<p>詠新接到祖父嚴責的信，才悟到他祖父没有讀過英文日文，無怪把這些詞句，看作狗屁不通了，反覺好笑，</p>
<p>我想這種笑話恐絕不僅我這個同鄕閙着啦！</p>

<p>他從農村到上海來，總共不過五年吧，這是我親眼目覩的事，初來的辰光，一種土頭土腦的神情，到現在還可以在我的腦海裏映出來。</p>
<p>他在ＸＸ商店充一位普通職員。薪給自然有限的，他歡喜吃點三酉兒和小食，每月的進益除去了一切的開支，略有　餘儲蓄起來，在第二年的冬天，由他家庭作主，給他定了一個村姑做他的妻子，當時我還送一份薄禮，他呢？自然興高采烈地回故鄕去做新官人去了！</p>
<p>等他婚後重來，我和他的幾個同事，一窩蜂似的擁將攏來，要他宣佈新婚的經過報告大衆，他雖則不發一言，但是看他眉飛色舞笑口常開的神態，已足代表他内心的愉快！愛情的甜蜜！</p>
<p>一年丨兩年丨三年，光陰先生飛似的不停的往前騰躍，說也奇怪！他的一切的動作，也迅速地變遷着，進行着，自頭頂到脚跟，早裝束得一漂二亮！非但不敢再當他鄕下人，恐怕誰都要稱一聲闊大少啊！同時他看到上海的這種摩登女郎，那有不使他心裏活躍躍的！偶然想起了鄕下家中的黃臉村婆，不期然而然的由納悶，煩惱，憤恨，結果早在心房深處懷着她！村姑！斷不能與我偕老的一顆心！</p>
<p>可憐的她：就是在做夢也想不到自已被丈夫遺棄了！每日仍是按步就班的操持家政，可是一天一天的過下去，總接不到丈夫的一封信，更没錢寄回家去，她懷疑，她憂急，她終於毅然决然找到上海來，住在ＸＸ旅社裏，叫茶役到ＸＸ商店去請她的丈夫來。</p>
<p>他無可奈何，奔向ＸＸ旅社見了她面，劈頭咒道，（你來幹什麽？來尋死不成！）她自然是（未語涙先梳）了，後來更不知怎麽　了他的怒，竟被他惡狠狠的打了一頓，氣冲冲的跑得不知去向了！</p>
<p>唉！繁華的上海呀，萬　的上海呀！不知要引誘人們到什麽地步！造成多少罪惡爲止啊！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Ottawa Conference -徵- <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The world is watching the British Empire Economic Conference, which opened in Ottawa on the 21st of this month. Although the discussions are focused on internal issues of the British Empire, the importance of its nature is no less than the European Federation advocated by France, the Pan-American Alliance advocated by the United States, or perhaps even surpasses them. Because in this era of global economic panic, countries are eager to unite with other countries to create economic alliances in order to save themselves. However, within the British Empire, the various autonomous territories and colonies that were originally one entity tend to deviate from the mother country. It goes without saying that this is not a blessing for the future of the British Empire. How to reverse this decline and seek practical cooperation is a matter of daily concern for British politicians and the reason for convening the British Empire Economic Conference.</p>
<p>The British Empire Conference did not start this year. Its agenda was mainly political, not limited to economics. However, the 1930 Imperial Conference coincided with a period of severe economic panic, so its agenda focused on economics. This year's conference is a continuation of the previous conference, and its agenda is entirely economic. The most important issue will still be the preferential tariff issue within the British Empire. Preferential tariffs mean that mutual trade within the empire should have lower import tariffs than trade with foreign countries, or even be tax-free. The ultimate goal of preferential tariffs is free trade within the British Empire. In theory, if Britain wants to create an economic entity, it must remove trade barriers between the various parts of the empire. However, in practice, various difficulties inevitably arise. The grain tariff is one example. In 1929, the total export volume of wheat from the British Empire reached 5.8 million tons, but only 2 million tons were imported into Britain, and the remaining 3.8 million tons were exported to other countries. However, Britain imported as much as 3.5 million tons of wheat from foreign countries. Britain does not need to import these 3.5 million tons of wheat from abroad, as it can be obtained from within the Empire. However, to reject foreign imports, it is necessary to increase tariffs. An increase in tariffs will increase wheat prices, which is equivalent to increasing the burden on consumers. Furthermore, even if all the wheat needed by Britain is supplied domestically within the Empire, there will still be a surplus of 300,000 tons. If this surplus wheat is to be dumped abroad, the price must be lowered further. And domestic consumers will never be able to enjoy this further discounted wheat.</p>
<p>Secondly, Britain's preferential tariffs fundamentally conflict with the protectionist tariff policies of the autonomous territories. Because the various autonomous territories of British merchants are developing in terms of both politics and economics, the domestic financial resources are all derived from tariffs, and they are even taking proactive protectionist tariff policies to protect their emerging industries and commerce. It can be clearly seen that most of the countries in the world that adopted protectionist tariffs after the war were British autonomous territories, especially Australia and Canada, which were the most radical. Are these autonomous territories willing to sacrifice their policies and implement preferential tariffs for the benefit of the mother country? This is also a very big question.</p>
<p>Because of the various difficulties in implementing preferential tariffs, the 1930 British Empire Economic Conference, although making detailed studies, did not come to a concrete decision. It only stated that the existing preferential tax rates would continue for three years, and the main issues would be postponed to this year's Ottawa Conference for further discussion. Therefore, most of the agenda of this conference was left over from the previous conference. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>So, will this conference have solutions to the various issues? Judging from the speeches of the attending representatives before the opening of the conference, they seem to be quite determined to strive for the success of the conference. However, the wheat problem is not easy to solve as mentioned above. In other areas, India and Ireland are both important members of the British Empire. Now the Indian national movement has reached a climax, and Ireland is also in dispute with Britain. Whether they can be brought into the circle of British Empire preferential tariffs is even more questionable. And what kind of measures should be implemented for the many non-autonomous colonies is also a difficult problem to decide. Based on this, the future of the conference is not yet optimistic.</p>
<p>Finally, what should be mentioned is the currency issue within the British Empire. Although this issue is not directly related to preferential tariffs, it is because today cash is concentrated in the United States and France, resulting in a trend of expensive gold and cheap silver. If the price of silver fails to restore its original position, the vast Asian market will permanently lose its purchasing power. Even if a safe zone of preferential tariffs is built within the British Empire, and British Empire commodities cannot be sold abroad, it will still be a great obstacle to the recovery of British economic prosperity. Therefore, the conference plans to discuss the adoption of a bimetallic currency system, which is actually of great importance to our country. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">U.S. Secretary of State Announces <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Secret Documents to Japan from Over a Decade Ago</p>
<p>Intended to Prove that its Far East Policy is Consistent with the Wilson Era</p>
<p>Documents Show Lansing Criticized Japan's Patent Rights in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. State Department released a variety of documents related to the diplomatic relations between the United States, Japan, and Russia in 1917 and 1918. These documents were previously kept secret and unannounced. According to the documents, Secretary of State Lansing, during the tenure of the late President Wilson, notified Japan that the United States deeply felt that Japan's patent rights in the areas of Northern Manchuria and Outer Mongolia could cause the United States to accuse Japan of knowing only self-interest. Lansing also stated that such patent rights actively conflicted with the U.S. government's assistance to Russia and its views on China. Furthermore, the commander of the U.S. expeditionary force to Siberia recently wrote a book stating that Japan repeatedly sought to use the joint military expedition for its own convenience, while the United States was unwilling to make any concessions to Japan's intention to seek private interests through military intervention in Siberia. This matter and the documents released today can corroborate each other. (29th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Washington received in Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson publicly released secret documents to Japan at the time of the Russian Revolution on the 29th. After the Russian Revolution in November 1918, the United States, Britain, and Japan jointly sent troops to Siberia to attack the Soviet Russian revolutionary government. At that time, Wilson's Secretary of State Lansing sent a secret document to Foreign Minister Uchida, the content of which was that although the three countries initially agreed to cooperate in sending troops to Russia, observations of the Japanese troops occupying Siberia and Lake Baikal show that the Japanese military's actions in Siberia and Northern Manchuria were unreasonable and monopolistic in everything, violating international agreements. The U.S. government does not recognize the actions of the Japanese government. In addition, the actions in Northern Manchuria involve interference in China's autonomy. The U.S. government has to call the Japanese government's attention to this. The Japanese government received this news with a mixture of embarrassment and indignation, questioning why it was necessary to publicly release secret documents from over a decade ago at a time when the situation in the Far East was critical. According to the Japanese government's explanation, the United States may have been subject to discussions from all sides because of the letter between Stimson and Borah. Stimson wanted to prove that his policy towards the Far East is a traditional policy since Wilson, not Stimson's invention. (30th China United News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The self-defense army is extremely active on the eastern section of the Dongqing Railway, the Harbin-Suihua line. The Yoshioka unit has crossed Wujimishi and is advancing. The righteous army in the counties east of the Harbin-Changchun line is also active. Because Zhang Hailong's rebellious troops are focusing on defending the line, they are unable to divide their forces to attack. A unit of Japanese troops will depart from Harbin South and be stationed at various stations in the middle section of the Harbin-Changchun line, so as to exchange defenses with the rebellious troops.

<p>(Tokyo) Political circles here indicate that if Tang Yulin does not hand over Ishimoto to the Japanese side, a serious situation may occur between the Manchurian Japanese army and the Chinese army in Rehe.

The content is unknown. Military authorities here declared that the (Manchukuo) authorities recently negotiated with Rehe on the import of opium into Manchuria. The Chinese authorities are deeply afraid that Rehe will become part of (Manchukuo) because of this, so they are doing their best to prevent the Rehe authorities from approaching the (Manchukuo) authorities.

The Minister replied that the appointment of a plenipotentiary had nothing to do with the issue of recognition. This appointment of a temporary plenipotentiary was modeled after the precedent of dispatching a plenipotentiary ambassador to the Swiss government in the sixth year of the Taisho era.

<h3 id="e28">Temporary Suspension of Payment of the Gengzi Indemnity <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>丨Statement by T.V. Soong丨</p>
<p>The Seized Customs Revenue is Immense</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Shortfall Insufficient to Cover Debts</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister T.V. Soong stated today that the Gengzi Indemnity payment to Japan due at the end of July, approximately £33,000, has been temporarily suspended. Minister Soong explained the reason for this action, saying that although Japan has violated existing international agreements by seizing the tax revenues in the three northeastern provinces that the government guaranteed for debt repayments, the National Government has continued to make the monthly indemnity payments to Japan as scheduled. Now that the amount seized is immense, and especially since the seizure has resulted in a tax revenue shortfall insufficient to cover the necessary debt and indemnity payments, the Chinese government can no longer continue to make indemnity payments to Japan. Since the Japanese authorities seized the Northeast customs, the Chinese government has not received any customs duties from the three northeastern provinces. Moreover, even before the customs were seized, a portion of the collected taxes were still intercepted by the Japanese or the puppet regime in the Northeast. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Soong stated today that the Gengzi Indemnity due to Japan at the end of July has been temporarily suspended because Japan has violated international agreements by detaining the customs revenues of the three eastern provinces that the Chinese government used to offset debt and indemnity payments. The amount involved is substantial. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources say that China's suspension of the Japanese portion of the Gengzi Indemnity may expand the Sino-Japanese dispute, causing great anxiety about the overall situation. Financial circles expressed the opinion that China's credit has not improved due to recent developments. However, London authorities do not wish to comment on recent changes and are reportedly closely monitoring them. Various Japanese circles here believe that China cannot indefinitely suspend the Gengzi Indemnity, as this action could undermine the treaties signed after the Boxer Rebellion. This matter not only concerns Japan but also the countries involved in the Boxer Indemnity Treaty. Therefore, China's actions will set a bad precedent for all relevant countries.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice has drafted measures for the application of Article 2 of the Enforcement Law of the Code of Civil Procedure, which have been resolved and passed by the Legislative Yuan and are now promulgated as follows: After the enforcement of the Code of Civil Procedure, before the promulgation and enforcement of the Law of Court Organization, the jurisdiction of the court over litigation cases, where the court has no jurisdiction according to the new law but has jurisdiction according to the old law, or where the court has jurisdiction according to the new law but has no jurisdiction according to the old law, shall still be handled according to the old law. (Explanation) The new Code of Civil Procedure is formulated based on the principle of a three-level, three-trial system, but Article 2 of its Enforcement Law also provides for transitional provisions during the transition period, limited to litigation cases that were continued before the enforcement of the new law. Now, for the convenience of application, the measures are drafted to slightly extend the period and expand the scope, in order to seek a way to resolve judicial disputes without violating the original intent of the legislation.

<p>Industrial Circles Unable to Bear Heavy Taxation</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Advocates Limiting the Issuance of Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Warlords Willfully Go Their Own Way and Express Opposition</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 30th: At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Minister of Finance Takahashi proposed that Japan's emergency situation would end in approximately three years. The government should submit the total amount of public bonds it intends to issue in the next three years to this temporary Diet. Once approved by the Diet, they would be issued annually and must not exceed the set limit. Japan's economic downturn cannot bear heavy taxation. The only way is the public bond policy. If there are no restrictions, the increase in public bonds will be impossible to control in the future, and it will be difficult to maintain their market price. However, the other cabinet members did not agree. According to a certain important figure in political circles, the purpose of the public bond restriction案 proposed by Takahashi is to limit the continued increase in military spending for the invasion of China, indirectly preventing the military from further expanding the scope of its military actions in China. The military's opposition is also for this reason. Amidst the military's planning to attack North China, Finance Minister Takahashi's proposal is indeed noteworthy, demonstrating the will of Japanese capitalists and warlords.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: Minister of Finance Takahashi is striving to balance income and expenditure in the next fiscal year's budget, but he is finding it difficult to raise funds. Takahashi believes that issuing public bonds is better than raising taxes for the following reasons: (1) Some people advocate raising income tax, but there are very few people with huge incomes in Japan, and commercial companies are mostly managed by a few general companies. Therefore, raising income tax rates will not increase revenue. (2) Others advocate increasing securities tax rates, but this will reduce流动capital and make the economic situation worse. The Japanese government has recently taken repeated steps to stop the outflow of funds. Increasing securities tax rates, in principle, is the opposite. Although Takahashi holds this view, some of his subordinates disagree. Some say that Takahashi's reason for opposing raising income tax only refers to huge incomes, but in this time of national financial emergency, tax rates should also be increased for medium and low incomes, following the example of Britain and the United States. If we only rely on惜欵度日, even if the country recovers prosperity in the future, it will be difficult to repay the accumulated debt. The Japanese Diet may convene a special meeting at the end of August to discuss financial methods.</p>

<p>Average Debt of 400 Yuan per Household</p>
<p>Food and Clothing Are Insufficient, Crisis Lurks</p>
<p>Tokyo 국민 신문 reports that since the issue of rural relief arose, the fishing industry, which is also in dire straits, has also begun a relief movement with the authorities. Currently, more than 500 representatives have been selected from the nation's 2.9 million fishing village masses to hold a temporary meeting. It is planned that all fishermen will participate in a large-scale relief petition movement in late August. This is because the current debt of fishing villages nationwide amounts to 120 million yuan. There are 570,000 fishermen, with an average debt of more than 400 yuan per household. In total, the nation's fishing village masses reach 2.83 million people, and the elderly and children, who have no productive capacity, must bear an average of 80 yuan. Their lives are now in a state of danger. The most tragic are the coastal fishermen in the northeastern region, who used to profit greatly from trade with China. Since the Sino-Japanese incident, they have all been in an irreparable state of poverty. People who eat two meals a day, one meal a day, or even no food all day long can be seen everywhere. Fishermen in Okinawa Prefecture only rely on mountain potatoes to satisfy their hunger, and almost all fishermen in Chiba Prefecture eat only two meals a day. Their poverty is heartbreaking. If there is no way to solve the relief problem, a crisis will erupt, which is unimaginable.</p>

<p>Orders a Ten-Day Political Truce</p>
<p>All Gatherings and Parades are Prohibited</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 30th: Tomorrow, the German Lower House will hold elections. Up to 44.5 million male and female voters nationwide will participate. No matter how the election results change the parties in the parliament, the government will resolutely continue its task of reforming and consolidating the country.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th: Germany is peaceful throughout the country today, but people's hearts are very tense. The final act of the election campaign is proceeding with great vigor, but no serious riots have occurred. Today, someone in Berlin put tens of thousands of business cards into various mailboxes, with the name of Prime Minister Papen printed on them, along with a miniature of his handwriting, stating that it would be impolite to choose another party instead of the National Socialist Party. Tomorrow, the police will be fully deployed, and as usual, the sale of alcohol will be prohibited, and demonstrations and gatherings will not be allowed. The election results will be broadcast to the public by radio.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th: The government has published an article stating that the government and the president both want the public to fulfill their responsibility to vote on this day, which concerns the fate of Germany. The public now needs a government that is not bound by any political party and can cooperate with the parliament. The parliament is willing to work in cooperation with a strong government within the constitutional structure. The political future of Germany is now firmly in the hands of 44 million voters. It is expected that 80 percent of voters will vote. The results will not be known until after dawn on Sunday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th: President Hindenburg issued an order today declaring a ten-day political truce starting from July 31st. During this period, all public gatherings and demonstrations are prohibited. Violators will be subject to detention and fines. After the issuance of this order, the election on Sunday can reduce serious disturbances.</p>

<p>National Social, Berlin, 29th: The most intense competition in recent years in Germany will begin tomorrow morning for a final 24-hour struggle. All five major parties that still occupy an important position in this election campaign, namely the National Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Center Party, the Communist Party, and the National 권 Party, are confident of winning. In the old parliament, there were 122 seats, and the parties to which they belonged have now lost power, and they are likely to be distributed among the major parties. According to the recent division of the Prussian parliamentary elections, it is predicted that the Social Democratic Party will win about 112 seats, the Center Party and the Bavarian National Party will win a total of 92 seats, the Communist Party will win about 70 seats, the National Socialist Party will win about 232 seats, and the National 권 Party will win about 33 seats. However, after the various events in recent days, the tendency of public opinion has changed, and it may not be possible to use the results of the Prussian parliamentary elections as a standard anymore.</p>

<p>Germany Has No Intention of Implementing Arbitrary Politics</p>
<p>Restrictions and Shackles Have Become Unbearable</p>
<p>National Social, Berlin, 29th: Prime Minister Papen gave a speech in English on the radio station today, which was transmitted to the United States, explaining the necessity of the government's recent actions in Prussia and Germany's views on sharing equal rights with other countries. He said: Germany's earnest desire for security can be evidenced by the events of recent weeks. The outside world cannot fully understand the confrontation between the far left and far right factions in Germany, which threatens to lead to civil war. The movements of these two factions have nothing in common. Communism is a revolutionary movement and is a great threat to Germany and the world. The current government feels that the security it has established nationwide can be guaranteed without worry. The appointment of the Prussian commissioners is not permanent赞but a temporary emergency plan. The sovereignty and establishment of the German federal states cannot be infringed upon. As for the claim that the government will implement the 通克推多制, this statement is simply absurd. I and my colleagues will never support such action. What Germany wants is nothing more than peace and security, and the力to solve the major problems that the world needs to address. However, it has been fourteen years since the end of the European War, and Germany's claim to the equal rights that a great power should enjoy is still hindered by the Treaty of Versailles. The German people cannot bear it.</p>

<p>Shao Lizi Reports No Conflicts Between Hui and Han People, Telegram to the Gansu Provincial Government Liaison Office on Hubu Street, Nanjing, for Transmission to Newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai: I recently saw in Shanghai newspapers dated the 15th and 16th of this month, a Beijing dispatch stating that the conflicts between Hui and Han people in Gansu Province have not subsided, that Tusi Yang Jiqing massacred over 20,000 Hui people in Lintan, and that the Islamic Students' Association in Beijing has appealed to various parties for help. It also stated that the conflicts between Gansu Tusi and Hui people are likely to escalate, that Yang Jiqing reported to the province, and that Lin Jing urgently went to Lintan to inspect and mediate, etc. Upon investigation, there are currently no conflicts between Hui and Han people or between Tusi and Hui people in Gansu Province. The Islamic Students' Association in Beijing's accusation against Yang Jiqing refers to events before 1930. The provincial government has already responded to the association in detail, stating that the past should not be pursued and that peace should be sought together. In discussing the past, there was mutual killing and no single party can be held solely responsible, but now everyone must be jointly aware and dispel past grievances. Yang Jiqing has not come to the province. Director Lin went to Lintan to handle the resettlement of refugees. I also personally wrote to Yang Jiqing, instructing him to do his best to protect the Hui people in Lintan, which he has complied with and donated 5,000 yuan. It is believed that he will obey the provincial government's orders and will not engage in any further transgressions. The reported details are entirely untrue. The nation is in dire straits, and all ethnic groups should unite to resist. When I arrived in Gansu, I said that we treat people with sincerity and handle affairs with impartiality, and I firmly believe that there will be no problems between the Hui and Han people, and the same applies between the Han and other ethnic groups. The reply to the Islamic Students' Association will be sent separately by mail. Please publish this telegram in major newspapers. Shao Lizi bows.</p>

<p>1.  Komai to Request Resignation from Tokyo</p>
<p>Komai Tokusaburo, the Supreme Emperor of the Puppet State of Manchuria and Chief of General Affairs of the Puppet State's State Council, according to a Tokyo telegram yesterday, Komai will arrive in Tokyo soon to submit his resignation to the Japanese Cabinet. It is proposed that Maruyama Tsurukichi succeed him. Komai's resignation was rumored once in mid-June, but was subsequently cancelled after persuasion from puppet dignitaries. However, the Japanese side did not dare to disclose the content. According to our sources, the main reasons are threefold: firstly, the opposition of Japanese officials; secondly, the complexity of financial issues; and thirdly, the strategy to deal with the Volunteer Army. Details are elaborated below in separate sections.</p>
<p>2.  Corrupt Japanese Officials Permeate the Northeast</p>
<p>Within the puppet state, there are approximately three types of Japanese officials who are fighting, opposing, and resisting each other: firstly, the opposition between the civilian faction and the military faction; secondly, the opposition between honest officials and corrupt officials; and thirdly, the opposition between the Fascist Party and the Liberal Party. According to statistics, there are more than 150 Japanese officials in the various agencies of the puppet central government of Manchuria. As for the local agencies and the newly seized customs, salt administration, postal service, and the former Chinese state-owned railways, Japanese personnel have also been gradually installed, and the number is increasing daily. It is impossible to know the details accurately. However, Japanese officials, depending on the size of the agency recommended by their background and the strength of their backers, often engage in open and covert struggles, each showing their abilities. In particular, those recommended by the military閥 are the most arrogant. This Northeast Incident has relied on the power of the military in everything, expanding the Japanese situation in the Northeast, thus leading to the opposition between the civilian faction and the military faction. Moreover, the military department believes that the puppet organization of Manchuria should be subordinate to the Governor-General of Kwantung, without the need for further concealment, and should take this opportunity to directly control it as a colony. Civilian officials, on the other hand, argue that they should not immediately abandon their masks, but should outwardly advocate respecting the slogans of the Chinese people in order to reduce international resentment. Therefore, while prioritizing Japanese interests, they dare not treat the Chinese people harshly, and fear that the Chinese people will suddenly change, which will be detrimental to the Japanese. As a result, they will inevitably want to achieve quick success, abandon their name, and take the reality, which is the best policy. However, radical soldiers have always opposed this view. This is the opposition between the civilian and military factions.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the resistance between corrupt officials and honest officials. Originally, most of the Japanese officials recommended by the Japanese army in the Northeast were ruffians and vagrants used by the Japanese military for many years, that is, the so-called Manchurian ruffians or China experts. It is natural for villains to be successful and do all kinds of evil. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army has commended and cherished their past achievements in disrupting China over the years, and in order to use their so-called China expert skills, they have vigorously recommended them to the puppet state, assigning them to important official positions. These people are morally corrupt and inherently greedy. In the past, they relied on the power of their country in China to sell drugs and harm the country, relying on their power to bully others. They are also accustomed to a life of debauchery. In addition to knowing a little about the situation in China and secretly reporting to their country, they have no skills to deal with the world. It is said that since the puppet state came to power, the consumption of the Japanese tavern Yachiyo in Changchun (that is, a tavern兼堂子) has been statistically over tens of thousands of yuan a night, all spent by the puppet state's Japanese officials indulging in prostitution. Moreover, after the Japanese officials came to power, Japanese taverns in various places were full. This can be used as ironclad evidence of the Japanese officials' corruption and debauchery and exploitation of the people's wealth. This is still not enough to fully describe the corruption of the puppet state's Japanese officials. Now, let's give an account of the extortion of a few prominent officials to inform the people of the country. For example, Horii, the Japanese adviser to the Harbin Shipbuilding Bureau, has extorted tens of thousands of yuan in less than three months since taking office. Xie Jieshi, the puppet foreign minister, has also reached more than one million yuan in less than three months. Xie Lyuxi, the representative of Rehe, has also pocketed more than 120,000 yuan in less than a month. These are the most obvious examples. This kind of corruption is mostly sheltered by Komai, the Chief of General Affairs, or caused by insufficient supervision. Officials who are a little more disciplined are afraid of being implicated and suspected, and are very dissatisfied with their behavior. There are many who secretly criticize them, so there is another opposition. This is the content that Tokyo has long wanted to persuade him to resign.</p>
<p>3.  Failure to Co-opt Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>Four Puppet Officials Act as Guarantors</p>
<p>In addition to what was described above, Komai's resignation is due to the failure to take responsibility for the policy of co-opting General Ma Zhanshan. The Japanese military閥 has always advocated resolving Ma Zhanshan by force, but the civilian officials represented by Komai advocated co-opting General Ma through a bribery policy, saying that otherwise the Japanese army would suffer heavy casualties. The military department reluctantly agreed and sent Xie Jieshi to meet with General Ma. After several consultations, General Ma, in order to endure humiliation and achieve great success, feigned surrender to the Japanese and went to Harbin to meet with Honjo, participating in Honjo's plan to establish a puppet state and obtaining its secrets. Then he severed relations with Honjo and announced its secrets to the world. The Japanese military閥 was very resentful of Komai's miscalculation and attacked him fiercely. Komai submitted his resignation in mid-June because of this. In fact, it was out of temporary anger. From then on, the opinions of the Japanese military閥 and the civilian faction deviated further and further. The military閥 and Manchurian ruffians believed that Manchuria was a Japanese territory, and everything had to be obeyed by the Japanese, especially under the command of the Japanese military閥. The civilian officials represented by Komai wore masks and vigorously advocated that Manchuria was an independent country and should not be interfered with, nor should Japanese people monopolize its agencies, arousing international disgust. They also said that if the Japanese regarded Manchuria as a territory, it was difficult to guarantee that there would be no second anti-Japanese leader like Ma Zhanshan, so they tried to stop it in every way. The Japanese military閥 hated this very much. However, at that time, the puppet dignitaries secretly hated the arrogance of the Japanese military people, and they all stood up to support Komai in order to maintain their temporary face. Although the Japanese military department was very dissatisfied with Komai, it did not take drastic action because the environment was not yet mature and feared that internal cracks would cause adverse consequences. Therefore, on the surface, they still persuaded Komai to do his best. However, from then on, the Japanese military department's surveillance of the puppet state officials became stricter. The appointment of an official in the puppet foreign ministry can be used as an example to illustrate this. Recently, someone who works as a clerk in the puppet foreign ministry must find four guarantors to ensure that he will not oppose Japan while in office and will not leave the East Province for mainland China after retirement. If there is any violation, the guarantors will be jointly liable before he can be hired. Others, such as section chiefs, police chiefs, or regimental commanders or brigade commanders, all have so-called Japanese advisers who supervise them. Nothing can be implemented without the signature of the Japanese adviser. Therefore, the puppet state has deep grievances against the Japanese military閥, but they have no choice in this situation. If a Japanese-Russian incident occurs, or the National Government sends troops to recover lost territory, they will surely turn against them and respond to the National Army. Therefore, the conflict between the civilian officials and the military閥 is getting deeper and deeper, and Komai's handling is becoming more and more difficult. This is another reason why Komai had to submit his resignation.</p>
<p>4.  Financial Resources Have Reached the End of the Road</p>
<p>Benevolent Words but Ruthless Exactions</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in the three northeastern provinces last year, the war and chaos have not stopped for a single day. The land is full of smoke and fire, cities and towns are in ruins, people have died tragically, and crops have failed. The entire land is like a hell. In order to co-opt the people, the Japanese ordered puppet officials to promote their meager taxes and the politics of the royal way everywhere, in order to cover up the situation of thousands of holes and hundreds of sores caused by their military force. However, the people are still mostly resistant to paying taxes. Therefore, the finances of the puppet state have reached the end of the road. The military expenditure is increasing day by day, and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people is also increasing. In addition, the industries in various places have been occupied by the Japanese, and the positions in the government offices have also been seized by the Japanese. From top to bottom, the anti-Japanese situation is brewing more and more intensely. If the current situation cannot be dealt with, the puppet organization in the Northeast will not be far from its end. In order to cope with the difficult financial situation, the puppet organization is desperately demanding that the Japanese government recognize the puppet organization, and then sign a treaty, sell the country, and ask Japan for loans to save the current crisis. In fact, the Japanese have many differences in the views of the military閥 and the civilian faction on this financial crisis. This is also one of the reasons why Komai had to submit his resignation. From this observation, it can be seen that the puppet state is surrounded by crises. Taking the financial issue as an example, the Japanese government is unable to take care of itself, so how can it have the ability to cope with the crisis of the puppet state? Moreover, there is an internal opposition between the civilian and military factions, and an external bloody battle with the Volunteer Army. From now on, the affairs of the Northeast are really unbearable to ask. (21, 7, 27)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Major Victory for the Left Route Bandit Suppression Army <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Reward Offered for the Capture of He Long</p>
<p>Chiang Rewards Xu Yuanquan's Troops with 45,000 Yuan</p>
<p>And Cables to Bandit Suppression Troops in Three Provinces to Relentlessly Suppress</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the recovery of Qianjiang and the relief of Zao City, He Long's remnants have no foothold on the north and south banks of the Xiang River. They have reorganized the pseudo 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd Divisions, using regiments as units, and fled in all directions. He Long himself led the 7th and 8th Divisions, passing through Tai Li Temple and Lower Yang Port, and retreated to the Maliangji area west of the Xiang River. Xu Yuanquan, the Deputy Commander of the Left Route Army, is personally supervising the 48th Division, the 44th Division of Xiao Zhichu, the 41st Division of Zhang Zhenhan, the 13th Division of Wan Yaohuang, and the 37th Brigade of Liu Peixu, as well as coordinating with the Sichuan Army to pursue and suppress the bandits in different directions. According to reports, the bandits have indeed broken into small groups, and internal divisions are also emerging. Those who bring weapons to surrender are constantly appearing along the road. The Xiang River and Fu River areas have been cut off by He Duan's occupation of Tianmen, Mianyang, Hanchuan, and Qianjiang counties for nearly a year. Now that the main force of the bandits has been defeated and various places have been successively recovered, the shipping companies have decided to resume navigation within days. Xu Yuanquan believes that He's bandits are trapped in a corner, which is a good opportunity for complete annihilation. In addition to ordering the Red bandits to surrender and guaranteeing the safety of their lives and property, heavy rewards will be given to those who can capture the bandit leader. He also telegraphed He Chengjuan, the Commander of the Left Route Army, to inquire whether it is possible to follow the previous order of the provincial government and reward 100,000 yuan to inform the various armies to work hard to capture the bandit leader He Long to eliminate the scourge of the people. After receiving the telegram, He replied to the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Xia Douyin, on the 27th, stating that he was willing to make efforts to raise funds and must obtain the chief culprit, and at the same time ordered the Financial Department to raise funds for use. Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief, rewarded 45,000 yuan on the 29th in recognition of the meritorious service of the Left Route Army in suppressing bandits, including 10,000 yuan each for the 48th, 41st, 44th, and 13th Divisions, and 5,000 yuan for the 37th Brigade, and telegraphed the bandit suppression troops in the three provinces to work together to relentlessly suppress, roughly stating (The Red bandits have indeed broken into small groups to avoid our encirclement and suppression. I hope that our armies will follow the planned program, secretly investigate and strictly search, relentlessly suppress, and use a neat and solemn formation to appease the people, firmly pursue and chase to achieve lasting results and complete the task. We also hope to make every effort to publicize and guide the bandits to surrender, heavily reward the surrendered prisoners. The officers and soldiers have worked hard during the long march in the hot summer. We are always concerned about them. I hope they will work hard for the party and the country and complete the revolution) and so on. The provincial and municipal party departments and the Wuhan chambers of commerce also held a joint meeting on the 29th to discuss ways to comfort the bandit suppression soldiers who were fighting in the hot summer, and decided to organize a comfort society, assuming 20,000 yuan as comfort money to raise from all parties. Under the heavy rewards, commendations, and comforts, the morale of the bandit suppression soldiers has been boosted, and it should not be a problem to eliminate the remnants of the bandits. As for the expenses for suppressing bandits, the provincial government bears a heavy burden. Since July, the Finance Department has directly allocated 100,000 yuan to the Sichuan Army, 30,000 yuan to Zhang Liansan's troops, 320,000 yuan submitted to the General Headquarters for verification and disbursement, and 200,000 yuan allocated by order of the Military Commission, plus the newly added 90,000 yuan special bandit suppression fee, totaling 740,000 yuan. Although the provincial treasury is in dire straits, it cannot but make efforts to raise funds to meet this urgent need. In addition to implementing an increase in the regular amount of land tax to supplement the provincial treasury's deficit, a committee for expediting payments has been organized jointly with the Pacification Commissioner's Office to expedite the payment of public bonds raised by the gentry and wealthy people in charge of the Clean Village Promotion Association. On the 29th, the association sent a letter to the Clean Village Promotion Association, requesting that the names, addresses, and amounts raised from each household that has not paid be sent for collection.

<p>To Quickly Organize the Hubei Security Department</p>
<p>Jurisdiction and Powers Defined by General Headquarters</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief, believes that in the major bandit suppression campaign in Hubei Province, security matters are of utmost importance and should be handled by a dedicated agency. He has appointed Fan Xiji as the Director of the Hubei Provincial Security Department, with a deadline for taking office, and the General Headquarters will define his jurisdiction and powers: (1) The existing security groups in Hubei Province will be under the jurisdiction and reorganization of the department. (2) The local security groups, militia, and all mass self-defense organizations in Hubei Province will be under the supervision and command of the department, and will be organized. (3) The household registration and Baojia system handled by the county governments in Hubei Province will be promoted and completed by the department within a deadline. (4) The department will still be subject to the supervision and guidance of the Hubei Provincial Government and the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Hubei. At the same time, the provincial government and the Pacification Commissioner's Office are notified. The order states (For the purpose of notification, the Hubei security affairs are closely related to the bandit suppression campaign and should be handled by a dedicated agency.

<h3 id="e89">Jiangxi Bandits Attempt to Flee to Hunan and Hubei <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Plan After Zhu and Mao's Failed Attempt to Invade Guangdong</p>
<p>Kong's Bandits Also Attempt to Break Out of Hubei Eastward from Northern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Bandit Suppression Troops Have Been Deployed to Block and Suppress Separately</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the failure of Zhu Mao Peng's various forces to attack Guangdong, they retreated to Southern Jiangxi. According to a senior military officer who recently returned to the province from the front line, the advance obtained reconnaissance reports. A decision was made by the pseudo-central government of the bandits in Ruijin: (1) Use Hubei as a development hub, and have bandits Kuang, He, Duan, and Kong meet in Wuhan, hoping to take the Yangtze River as a base. (2) Have bandits Zhu, Mao, and Peng bypass Northern Guangdong, hoping to take Guangzhou as an outlet to the sea. (3) Hold on to the base areas on the Fujian-Jiangxi border to survive by luck. Since the above two items have now completely failed, the bandits will only be able to implement the third item in the future. Recent reports from aircraft reconnaissance show that there are no bandit traces in Northern Guangdong and the Dayu area of the Three Southern Provinces. The bandits in Xinfeng City have also withdrawn. Only small pseudo-guerrilla teams, self-defense forces, and miscellaneous bandits remain in the rear of the bandits, such as Ningdu, Shicheng, Yudu, and Xingguo, Ruijin. The main force of the bandits is completely concentrated in the Wangfu Wangmu Ferry Fengshupai Xiashawo Datang Ao area at the intersection of Xinfeng, Ganzhou, Anyuan, Yudu, and Huichang, with a tendency to peep into Ganzhou and escape westward across the middle section of the Gan River. Because Nankang,</p>
<p>Dayu, Chongyi, and Shangyou are heavily guarded by Chen Cheng, Yu Hanmou, and Liu Jianxu's troops, and the Guangdong-Guangxi armies on the Guangdong border are also very strong, while the 19th Route Army in Western Fujian is advancing steadily, and the bandit nests in Tingzhou and Ninghua are greatly threatened. In Eastern Jiangxi, such as Nanfeng, Yihuang, Le'an, and Yongfeng, Mao Bingwen, Hao Mengling, Li Yunjie, and Gao Shuxun's troops are stationed, and once they cross the border between Ningdu and Guangchang counties, they will be in a plain with convenient transportation, and it will be difficult for the Red bandits to operate there. Only the middle section of the Gan River and the Hunan-Jiangxi border in Western Jiangxi have relatively weak bandit suppression forces, and most of the counties in Western Jiangxi, such as Yongxin, Ninggang, Lianhua, and Anfu, have been banditized, while counties such as Ji'an and Suichuan have been mostly banditized. Scattered bandits in various places, such as Li Tianzhu's pseudo-1st Division, Zheng Haiming's pseudo-8th Division, Xiao Ke's pseudo-5th Division, and the pseudo-guerrilla teams, guard regiments, and peasant self-defense forces in various places, are all the bandits' claws. Therefore, it is somewhat possible for the bandits to flee westward. According to a pseudo-central plan and instructions seized by a certain division, Zhu De's pseudo-1st Army was to attack Ganzhou, hoping to open up the Red area of Eastern Jiangxi, Southern Jiangxi, and Western Jiangxi. Peng Dehuai and Ji Zhendong's pseudo-3rd and 4th Army Corps were to rush through Western Jiangxi into Hunan, moving east along the Hunan-Jiangxi border to disrupt the rear of Wuhan, hoping to relieve the siege of the bandits in Eastern Hubei and recklessly complete the plan to meet in Wuhan. According to news from Xiushui, Kong Hechong's pseudo-16th Army, the 7th, 8th, and 9th Independent Divisions, and the pseudo-Guard Division have completely left Xiushui and Tonggu, and are disturbing Xianning and leaving Eastern Hubei through Wu Ning Tongshan, echoing Kuang Jixun's forces on the border of Hubei, Anhui, and Henan. Peng's bandits have the delusion of fleeing westward from Western Jiangxi to Pingliu and even Tongchong to meet. In terms of the situation, it seems that the Red bandits will undoubtedly flee westward into Hunan and Hubei. However, the National Army, led by Luo Zhuoying, Zhou Zhirou, and Wang Maode, has a strict defense along the Gan River in Ganzhou, Wan'an, Taihe, and Ji'an, and the Hunan Army also has considerable precautions on the Hunan-Jiangxi border. If the bandits flee westward, they can definitely be defeated on both sides of the Gan River. (July 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Road Construction and Port Development Underway</p>
<p>Road Construction Project Largely Complete</p>
<p>Port Development Plan Awaits the Coming Year</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The problem of developing a port at Hugou in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been discussed for a long time, so the railway bureau is actively proceeding with the extension of the Xin-Xu railway line. Some time ago, it sent the Chief of the General Affairs Section, Yu Shibin, to the sea to inspect everything. According to his conversation when passing through Xuzhou upon his return to Zhengzhou, the road construction project in the eastern section is divided into three sections. The first section runs southeast from Xinpu to Hugou, about 24 kilometers long. This section is entirely earthwork, contracted out to bidders and calculated by the square measure. The second section, from Hugou to Lao Yao, is about 15 kilometers long and entirely stonework. Passing through Sunjia Mountain, it is necessary to excavate a cave and build a tunnel, also contracted out. Near Lao Yao, a seaport dock is being built, as the third section. In total, from Xinpu Dapu to the terminal point, the length is about 56 Chinese miles. The earthwork in the first section is very easy, and it can be completed in three or four months. The second section is more laborious and will take six or seven months to complete. The third section is purely port development work, building the Lao Yao dock, which must be a peninsula-style dock, capable of accommodating 3,000-ton ships on all three sides. It is also necessary to build railway tracks on both sides of the dock, so that passengers and goods can be directly moved without the effort of transfer. The port development plan first involves dredging the silt in the port to ensure that heavy-laden ships can pass smoothly. In the future, the eastern Lian Island in the east will be connected to the old dock by a seawall, forming a unified whole and serving as a dry dock. Then its prosperity will be comparable to Hong Kong and Qingdao. At present, the road construction project is progressing very quickly. The railway has purchased two small steamers specifically for transporting materials, transporting them from Dapu along the coast to Lao Yao, some for building stone bridges and tunnels, and some for preparing materials for port development. This time, the extension of the railway line faces economic difficulties, so a section of the abandoned Qingyang Railway branch line has been dismantled, borrowing a large number of railway track materials to pave the Xin-Xu railway line. However, it is still necessary to purchase more than 100,000 yuan worth of sleepers. The railway work is estimated to be around 400,000 yuan. If all kinds of materials are calculated at the total cash required, excluding port development, the various projects will also require around 2 million yuan. Currently, the road construction project is not a problem, and the port development plan will continue next year. (July 29th)</p>

<p>Prostitutes Ordered to Leave the Territory by a Deadline</p>
<p>Opium and Gambling Absolutely Prohibited</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In recent years, Bengbu's morals have been declining, and the root cause lies in the three evils of opium, prostitution, and gambling. Public prostitutes are renamed singing girls, and the Public Security Bureau collects "clear singing donations" from them to subsidize police salaries, which can amount to four or five thousand yuan per month. However, the singing girls still mainly engage in prostitution, with singing being only incidental. There are no fewer than six or seven hundred public and private prostitutes in the entire city, so brothels are everywhere. Moreover, opium dens are densely packed, and gambling halls are open, especially serving as places to hide petty criminals. Previously, opium dens were taxed by the government through lamp taxes, and gambling halls were taxed by bureau heads. Since Xu Tingyao was ordered to eliminate opium donations, opium taxes have no longer been collected, but open-air gambling is still unavoidable. Therefore, disputes and fights due to gambling among demobilized soldiers, ruffians, and vagrants in the entertainment venues occur almost daily. Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the Bengbu Garrison, recently convened a garrison meeting and had a detailed discussion on the prohibition of opium, prostitution, and gambling. Jiang advocated the complete prohibition of prostitutes, gambling, opium, and drug pills to restore declining morals. Today (28th), he specifically issued an order to implement it, ordering all public and private prostitutes in Bengbu to leave the territory by the end of July, and absolutely prohibiting gambling, opium, red and white pills, etc., from today. He also ordered military and police agencies and troops to strictly enforce the order, without favoritism or concealment, in order to completely prohibit these activities. (28th)</p>

<p>Songjiang Bank Creditors to Receive 10% Payout</p>
<p>After the collapse of Songjiang Bank in February amidst the war in Shanghai, depositors and savers formed creditor groups and filed lawsuits, alleging that the bank president, Xie Liangda, had fled with his family, and that the directors and supervisors should be responsible for repayment. The court designated an accountant to handle the liquidation and sent letters to all debtors to demand repayment. Not only were few repayments received, but many unsecured debts were found, clearly indicating fraud by the bank's executives. The liquidation office is now selling off houses and government bonds, with the proceeds sufficient to distribute a 10% payout. The payment is scheduled to begin on August 5th. Previously, after the Education Bureau's Asset Management Office requested the seizure of President Xie's residence and land, Xie's relative, Mr. Xie Yu, filed a lawsuit in court, raising an objection to the enforcement. The reason given was that the houses and land were jointly owned by the brothers and had not yet been divided, so the brothers should not be affected by Xie Liangda's actions. The lawsuit filed by Zhang Zuo, Liu Zhu Jing, and Lü, representatives of the creditor group, was heard in court yesterday. The directors and supervisors appointed lawyer Sha Xunyi to appear in court as their representative, while the creditor group appointed lawyers Liu Zhimou and Zhai Yue to appear in court. After the interrogator investigated the facts in detail, he ordered the liquidation office to provide a further report for review. It is said that the savings depositors' creditor group will also entrust lawyers to file a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Detectives Stationed in Shanghai Arrest Kidnappers</p>
<p>The families of Wang Hanchen and Zhou Zhicheng in Pingzhuangtian, Bacheng, were robbed by a large gang of bandits last month. Before leaving, the bandits kidnapped Zhou Zhicheng and others. Afterwards, letters were received from the bandits demanding a large sum of money. The victims ignored the bandits' excessive demands. Two months later, the gang of bandits hid near a certain university in Jiangwan. After being discovered by Quan Lin, a detective stationed in Shanghai from this county, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was notified, and Patrol Officer Kong Fanren of the Zhabei Water Police Second Team led police to arrest them. Three bandit boats and eight bandits, including Wu Xiaoxizi, Zhou Xiaomazi, and You Xiaodeng, were arrested in the river. Fifty rounds of rifle ammunition were confiscated. Upon learning this, Director Tai of the County Public Security Bureau prepared a document on the 29th and sent Officer Chen and police to escort them back. They were brought back to Kunshan at 5 PM. Section Chief Xia interrogated them one by one. Because there were fifty or sixty accomplices in the case and the hostages had not yet been rescued, the matter was kept secret temporarily. The bandits were detained, and the county government was informed for questioning. Efforts are underway to apprehend the escaped bandits for punishment.</p>

<p>False Alarm on the Su-Chang Steamer</p>
<p>The Lao Gongmao Su-Chang steamer, which returned from Changshu the other day, carried patrol boat No. 6 of the 13th team of the 3rd district of the water police. When it reached a place near Likou, a white-hulled steamship suddenly approached, carrying more than seventy soldiers with complete firearms. As soon as it reached the side of the steamer, they jumped aboard the company's ship and circled to patrol boat No. 6, successively moving objects to the steamship. Among them was a box of bullets, with the words "bullet box" written on the surface, but it was unknown what was actually in the box. Before leaving, they also took the patrol officer of patrol boat No. 6 aboard the steamship and left. The authorities are now vigorously investigating the case, hoping to find out the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Conclusion of Arguments in the Xu-Ma Lawsuit <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Ma Baolin, the young owner of Ma Yuanji Satin Shop, and his fiancée, Xu Caizhen, committed suicide by poisoning. Xu Caizhen insisted on guarding her chastity at the Ma family after her husband's death. On the 11th of this month, it was Dou Lin's death anniversary, and Caizhen and her mother went to the Ma family to pay their respects, but were refused by Ma Zhang, Ma's aunt, causing a scuffle. Afterwards, Ma Zhang sued Caizhen for trespassing and assault. The Wuxian County Court opened a hearing on the 25th to mediate a reconciliation between the two parties. Subsequently, Xu Tang and her daughter Xu Caizhen sued Ma Zhang for assault and opium. After the prosecutor filed a public prosecution, the court, presided over by Judge Yang, held a hearing yesterday (30th). The plaintiff, Xu Tang, voluntarily withdrew the assault charge. Regarding the opium charge, Judge Yang repeatedly questioned Ma Zhang, who only admitted to occasionally smoking it in the past. Subsequently, the prosecutor made his argument, and the defendant's lawyers, Lu Hongyi, Gu Enpei, and Zhou Yuqin, made their defense. As a result, the court announced the conclusion of the arguments in the case and scheduled the verdict for August 1st.</p>

<p>Request to Borrow and Levy Grain Storage Funds</p>
<p>County Magistrate Chen of this county stated that the grain storage funds in this county had not been collected since 1920. The county government had repeatedly requested permission, but it was restricted by the 1% surtax, and permission could not be obtained. As of the end of June this year, only 20,000 yuan remained in these funds. Now, due to the urgent need for disaster relief, permission has been granted by the provincial government to borrow these funds. However, the entire population of Wuxi is more than 940,000, and many of them are poor farmers who urgently need relief. How can this amount be sufficient? Moreover, for future disaster preparedness, it is necessary to plan ahead. Therefore, it is proposed to temporarily borrow and levy the land price tax of one jiao per mu for the second term of this year, which was originally intended to be used for surveying expenses, for grain storage funds, limited to one time only, specifically for disaster preparedness. This measure is purely for the purpose of shifting funds to meet urgent needs, and what is taken from the people will still be used for the people. The local people should be able to understand this. The matter has been submitted to the 147th county administrative meeting and resolved, and the county has requested the provincial government for approval.</p>

<p>Security Regiment Stationed in Cheng奉令调通</p>
<p>The coastal area of Lvsi, Nantong, is rampant with pirates. Although it has gradually become peaceful after the provincial security department sent a guerrilla team to defend it, there are still small groups of pirates who often appear in remote ports along the river and sea, such as Gao, Hai, Men, Chongming, Qidong, and Liuhaisha. They demand ransoms and smuggle guns, which are quite active. The Provincial Security Department has decided to调江阴安保第一团開通。 After receiving the order, the regiment commander, Zhu Mian, will, within about a week, send the first and second battalions and the mortar company stationed in Cheng to Tong via the Yangtze River. The third battalion of Pingwang and the fourth battalion of Changshu will go to Tong from Fukou, stationed in Sanjia Town, Tongru, and other places. In Jiangyin, a part will be left for defense.</p>

<p>Xu San, a farmer from Qiuxin Township, Shazhou, Third District, found a mortar shell while cutting grass in the fields in March. It was shaped like a hammer. Xu San did not recognize it and placed it on top of the pigsty. It had been there for several months. Strong winds had been blowing for days, and the pigsty collapsed. At 2 PM on the 28th, Xu San was rebuilding the pigsty when he saw the shell still there. He wanted to know what it was, so he struck it hard with a wooden stick. With a loud bang, shrapnel flew in all directions, piercing his abdomen. His back and arms were blown off. His family rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but he died on the way.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Promotes Cooperative Chicken Farming</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Industry and Commerce believes that the chicken farming business is suitable for both specialized operation and farmers' sideline business. County governments should encourage farmers to consider local conditions, adopt cooperative methods, organize chicken farming cooperatives, jointly purchase chicks, jointly raise them, and jointly transport and sell chicken eggs and chickens, in order to promote agricultural production. It has specially compiled a model charter for such cooperatives and ordered the county governments to follow it.</p>

<p>The provincial government believes that in recent years, the surtaxes on land tax in various places have been several times higher than the regular tax, and the burden on the people has increased year after year. If strict restrictions are not imposed, it will not be enough to show caution and consideration. It is now stipulated that from the 21st year onwards, if any county increases the burden on the people, it must first submit the undertaking to the competent department for approval. If there are no violations, it will be submitted to the provincial government for discussion, in order to show restrictions and reduce the burden on the people. The above order has been issued to the departments for transmission to the counties for compliance.</p>

<p>Continued Collapse of the Jiang'an Riverbank in Liuwei</p>
<p>The Jiang'an Riverbank in Liuwei, Jiaxing Bridge, a part of the city, has collapsed repeatedly in recent years. Now, from 5 PM on the 27th to 8 PM on the 28th, it collapsed more than 60 zhang to the north and more than 20 zhang to the west, starting from the river mouth. Fortunately, when it cracked, the staff of the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Motor Vehicle Liuwei Station, as well as passengers and farmers, all saw it and rushed to dismantle houses and move things, saving about 70%. The remaining losses to fields and land are estimated at 60,000 to 70,000 gold. The materials for the motor vehicle station that fell into the river also amounted to more than 300 yuan. This morning (29th), cracks appeared in the uncollapsed areas, making further collapses inevitable. Fortunately, no one has been injured yet. Currently, the river mouth is only three li away from the Hongqiao Bridge. Passengers taking buses to the ferry all use the company's barges to be transported to the original ferry landing at the river mouth and walk more than 20 zhang before boarding the ferry. This is because the old bank of the river mouth still has a dike, and the ferry cannot reach the new river mouth.</p>
<p>Two Police Squadrons to Be Abolished</p>
<p>County Magistrate Yang Zirong previously submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs to abolish the first and second squadrons of the police force, but it has not yet been approved. It is now heard that a decision has been made to abolish them starting on August 1st. All of the police force will be reorganized into six squads, directly under the command of the brigade headquarters.</p>
<p>Public Security Branch Not Temporarily Abolished</p>
<p>The ten branches of the Jiangdu Public Security Bureau, due to financial difficulties, were unanimously resolved by the participating groups to be abolished during the review of the budget for the 21st year and transformed into substations. County Magistrate Yang believed that this measure could effectively remedy the current shortage of public security funds. However, Director Chen of the Public Security Bureau requested instructions from the department because the substations could not directly detain or fine people. It is now heard that the Department of Civil Affairs also believes that changing the police system is not something that Jiangdu County can do on its own, and that the Ministry of Interior is currently comprehensively planning to improve the unified methods of public security in various provinces. All matters related to reorganization should be awaited until the ministry issues orders for compliance. Therefore, the previous plan to abolish and merge the Jiangdu branches is temporarily difficult to implement.</p>

<p>Project Acceptance of the Canal Dike</p>
<p>The canal dike in northern Jiangsu has been completed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government specially united with the relevant agencies to organize the acceptance committee of the canal dike project in northern Jiangsu. The acceptance committee members departed from Yangzhou on the 16th of this month to accept the project works in the Huai-Pi section, Gao-Bao section, and Jiangdu section. The works of the upper reaches of the canal have been accepted. The committee members arrived in Gaoyou at 8 PM on the 26th and have been busy accepting the Gaoyou Pan East-West Dike. The reporter visited the West Dike office last night (27th) and met with the acceptance committee members, asking about the progress of the acceptance work. Acceptance committee member Dong Bochun detailed the progress as follows: The committee members departed from Yangzhou on the 16th of this month, arrived in Qingjiangpu on the evening of the 17th, and began accepting the works in the Shuangjin Gate area on the 18th. On the 19th, they accepted the embankment and the project works in the Sanke River and Hongze Lake Dam area. On the 20th, the committee members were divided into two groups to accept the embankment works from Qingjiang to Huaicheng. The first group, consisting of committee members Dong Bochun, Chen Bomeng, and Xu Decheng, accepted the East Dike. The second group, consisting of committee members He Haiqiao, Shen Baojun, and Shen Binyan, accepted the West Dike. On the 21st, they accepted the East-West Dike from Huaicheng to Pingqiao. On the 22nd, they accepted the East-West Dike from Pingqiao to Zhaoying. On the 23rd, they accepted the East-West Dike from Baoying to Sishui. On the 24th, they accepted the East-West Dike from Sishui to Jieshou. On the 25th, they accepted the East-West Dike from Jieshou to Mapengwan. The committee members arrived in Gaoyou at 8 PM on the 26th, staying at the West Dike office and Ma Junqing's residence. On the 27th, they accepted the East-West Dike from Mapengwan to Dangjunlou. From 7 AM to 1 PM on the 28th, they accepted the West Dike from Shaolongwan to Yuehegang. At 4 PM, they accepted the East Dike from Fengshen Temple to Pipa Gate. They plan to accept the Dangjunlou, Hehuatang, Qigongdian, and Yumatou breaches on the 29th. The acceptance is expected to be completed by August 5th. However, the engineering in the Huai-Pi section, with the 清江汎 being the simplest, 平桥堤工 being the best. In the Gao-Bao section of the Baoying, the 临城 is the worst. The engineering in Baoying is not up to standard. Regarding the dike工程 with insufficient dimensions, according to the opinions of the committee members, it is proposed to deduct their earthwork price. Also, although the dimensions of the Gaoyou汎 West Dike are not far from the prescribed ones, there are many cracks. The committee members believe that this section of the engineering is too insubstantial and plan to discuss a remedy. Regarding the four breaches north of Gaoyou city, although we have not yet accepted them, we took the opportunity to look at them yesterday. The engineering at Yumatou and Qigongdian is the best, while the engineering at Hehuatang is not very good. The engineering at Dangjunlou is the worst, and a crack suddenly appeared in that place the day before yesterday. Four of the committee members insisted on not accepting the sweeping engineering at that breach.</p>

<p>Exemption of Additional Taxes on Newly Reclaimed Wasteland</p>
<p>The county government of this county recently received an order from the Department of Finance stating that the handling of supplementary grain assessment in this county has been underway for a long time, but the number of reports has not been high. The reason is that the additional taxes levied under the land tax have gradually increased. If this is not slightly changed, it will not be conducive to progress. It is now decided that from now on, regardless of whether it is newly reclaimed wasteland or privately owned beachland, the newly reported tax assessments will be exempt from all additional taxes for three years from the date of the report, in order to show consideration. The county government has issued a notice to this effect for public knowledge.</p>

<p>In Wangcun, the fourth district of Xiaoshan, farmers Wang Caifa and Zhang Jicheng, who live nearby, had a verbal dispute over draining water from a pond to catch fish, which then turned violent. On the night of the 27th, the Wang family gathered many people, each holding knives and spears, and attacked the Zhang family's village. The Zhang family also gathered twenty or thirty people, each holding sharp weapons, and confronted them. As a result, two people from the Wang family were injured by knives, and one person from the Zhang family was injured. It is heard that the injured from the Wang family are all in critical condition and their lives may be in danger. Both sides have been taken to the county court for examination, and it is unknown how the matter will be resolved.</p>
<p>Tobacco Leaves and Green Ramie Enjoy a Bumper Harvest This Year</p>
<p>The area in the western township of Xiaoshan, where tobacco leaves are produced, sells no less than tens of thousands of gold worth of tobacco leaves to tobacco companies in Shanghai and Hangzhou every year. This year, the weather during the summer dog days has been clear and sunny, and the tobacco leaves have dried to a bright yellow color when sun-dried. The green ramie grown in the sandy soil has also had a very abundant harvest, and the price is also very high. Usually, a large quantity is sold overseas. This large income for the farmers there is a small contribution to the rural economy.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Important News on Educational Administration of the Municipal Council <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The issue of subsidies for private schools: According to news from the Information Office of the Municipal Council, the Committee on Subsidies for Chinese Private Schools has drafted several suggestions, which have been approved in principle by the Education Committee. However, before submitting the subsidy list to the Board of Directors, the Education Bureau's suggestions and the Chinese Education Director's report on the economic conditions of the schools and the subsidy fee method should be translated into English for reference. Furthermore, the Health Department should be requested to report on the sanitary conditions of each school. The Committee on Subsidies for Western Private Schools has drafted this year's subsidy list, which is generally in accordance with last year's methods. However, the 500 taels originally allocated to the Tilpen Family School for one year will be transferred to the William Emperor School. The Education Committee has approved this proposal, but will re-evaluate the amount given based on the situation of each school.</p>
<p>Proposed tuition increase for Chinese primary schools: At the Education Committee meeting on July 20th, the Director of Chinese Education suggested that, due to the high cost of building primary schools in the Western District and the relatively good economic conditions of the students' families, tuition fees should be increased from six yuan to twelve yuan per year, starting from the spring of next year. The situation is similar in the Northern District primary schools, and the same approach is planned. At the same time, it is proposed to increase the number of free students in both schools from one-tenth to two-tenths. For the Eastern District primary schools, due to the large number of poor students, no increase is proposed. After deliberation, the committee decided that the Western and Northern District primary schools should increase tuition fees starting from February 1933. The amount of the increase and the number of additional free students will be considered later.</p>
<p>Selection of the principal for the Hanbury School: The Education Committee has received the names of 14 candidates for this position and decided that the Chairman of the Committee, Mrs. Leslie, one member of the Selection Committee, and the Acting Superintendent of Education will review them. During this period, the school affairs will still be handled by Mr. S. Hore as acting principal, and Mr. H. G. Huckstep will be asked to continue serving as the director of the dormitory. All of the above have been approved by the Board of Directors on the 29th.</p>
<p>Discussion on the school fee increase proposal: Regarding the proposal to increase tuition fees for various schools, a certain member previously drafted a plan to gradually increase fees for middle school and senior students, while not increasing fees for elementary school students. This method would only increase fees by about 7 percent. The Education Committee agreed to the principle of increasing fees several months ago. Therefore, four Chinese schools that did not receive subsidies in 1931 should not increase tuition fees for Chinese students this year. It was also stated that the increase in fees should be at the beginning of the year, but the justification for this was not sufficient. The Board of Directors has now approved the issuance of subsidies and set a goal of increasing tuition fees to one-third of the expenses. In addition, the recent hiring of high-salaried teachers and the drop in silver prices by the Bureau are all reasons why it has become necessary to increase tuition fees. After discussion, the Board of Directors decided on a compromise solution: starting from September this year, the tuition fees for each Chinese public school will be increased by four yuan, and another four yuan next year. The fee increase for each Western school will follow the original plan starting from the next semester. In addition, except for the exceptions listed by the committee, for students whose parents are not taxpayers in the concession, their tuition fees should be increased by one-quarter.</p>

<p>This year's Davis Cup Challenge Round between France and the United States is different from previous years. Tickets for the Roland Garros tennis court were sold out long ago. Today, the first match was watched by 15,000 people.

<p>Among the four players in today's Davis Cup match, Borotra was arguably the best. In recent international competitions, Vines seemed to be one of the best players in the world, but Borotra was still able to unexpectedly defeat Vines, which was no easy feat. The scores were particularly impressive. As for the match between Cochet and Allison, Cochet merely made Allison run around the court, exhausting him. Allison and Vines are about the same level. Judging from today's results, the Davis Cup will still be retained by France this year.</p>

<p>First Set At 2:15 PM, Borotra and Vines entered the court simultaneously, receiving enthusiastic cheers from the audience. Photographers and filmmakers competed to take pictures. After a draw, it was decided that Vines would serve first. The two practiced briefly before the official start of the match. Vines' shots, both forehand and backhand, were extremely accurate, giving him an advantage. However, Borotra rallied and regained balance. He won the first game. Borotra won again in the second game with a burst of energy. Vines won the third game, serving and defeating Borotra. In the fourth game, Borotra was troubled by his opponent and failed. At this point, Borotra and Vines had each won two games. Vines served quickly, and Borotra missed many balls, but then he quickly recovered, controlled the ball, and won the fifth game. Borotra then won two more games, taking a 5-2 lead. Vines sensed danger and worked hard to win two games, but Borotra ultimately won the first set 6-4.</p>
<p>Second Set At the beginning, Borotra seemed to have returned to his prime. His ball skills were amazing. Although Vines tried to control his enemy, he was ineffective. Borotra's shots became more rapid. Those who admired him were very happy. Borotra won the first two games. He failed in the third game. Then he again won two for a score of four to two. The balls he hit were long, straight and true. Vines continued running back and forth, but still failed to return the serve. Borotra won the second set 6-2.</p>
<p>Third Set At this point, Vines knew he should try to make a great effort. But he lost the first game. Borotra seemed to have a slight sign of tiredness. Vines took the victory with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>Fourth Set Both players rested for a while according to the practice. In the fourth set, Borotra followed his old technique and it seemed to have a positive result. But Vines won three straight games taking a 3-1 lead. Then, Borotra displayed his special skills. His shots were as fast as lightning and so precise. Both forehand and backhand shots landed on the edges of the court. Although Vines ran back and forth, he could not defend. Borotra won two straight games, and the score was tied. At this moment, the ball moved extremely fast. Observers were animated. The observers cheered and applauded every good shot. Vines' spirit waned, and his shots became sluggish. Borotra won the fourth set 6-4. In total, through four sets, Borotra was victorious with scores of 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.</p>

<p>Soon after, Cochet and Allison entered the arena to play. Allison showed extremely exquisite skills, and the ball he hit had a special effect.</p>

<p>Cochet, based on his past habits, fought slowly. Allison won the first set 7-5. In the second set, the ball's momentum gradually accelerated. Cochet won the first game. In the second game, the situation became more intense. Allison won, and Allison continued to work hard. But Cochet did not give him room for development. Both teams were quickly four to four and then five to five. Then Cochet came out of his hide like a fierce beast. He swept his enemy east and west so his enemy had to proceed cautiously. He took a defensive posture and hid at the end of the court and found it hard to return a shot. Cochet won the second set 7-5. Third Set</p>

<p>Allison showed a slight sign of fatigue. Cochet seized the opportunity to attack, making Allison run even more. Cochet first used short and steep high balls to induce the enemy to approach and then used a powerful shot to prevent him from backing away. The competition was fierce. Each step followed the other. Many times, the score was tied. At 3-3, Cochet changed his strategy again and pretended not to pay attention. He returned soft shots to exhaust the other side. Allison took a 4-3 lead, but Cochet's ball was extremely precise. In the end, he won the third set 7-5.</p>

Sports enthusiasts around the world thought that a stage for an international sports meeting that was hard to come by in a thousand years has just opened. The day was clear and the wind was calm. The crowds of visitors aimed at the sports field. Since morning, the asphalt streets have been crowded with cars. The trams and buses were all full of visitors. By noon, the sports field had already accommodated 100,000 spectators, and there was no room for another foot. Several tens of thousands of people were still outside the venue. At 3 PM, representative athletes from various countries gathered in the rest area, each preparing their teams, waiting for their arrival. At 2:30 PM, the US Vice President Curtis, representing the President, sang the US national anthem (Star-Spangled Banner) together. He arrived and sat in the front VIP seat.</p>

<p>At 2:50 PM, more than 2,000 participating athletes began to enter the arena. The first was Greece, the birthplace of the Olympics, and the last was the host country, the United States. The athletes from the various countries in between were arranged in ABC order, circling the arena. Chinese athlete Liu Changchun, holding the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag presented by Wang Zhengting, and Song Junfu, appeared in the team. The whole group was divided into four columns, all with a determination to win, circling the arena. The distance between the teams from each country was 20 to 30 meters, forming a long snake shape. Each team entered the arena through the Marathon Gate. The sound of applause was deafening, mixed with the voices of people, resembling a symphony. The Japanese athletes and the Chinese athletes, the Japan support group and the Chinese community, each cheered. When the athletes walked in front of the Vice President on the central viewing platform, they took off their hats and looked to the right, showing respect. They went half a circle to the viewing stand. Each team placed its flag in the front in a predetermined location. At 3:40 PM, members of the International Olympic Committee and the US Olympic Association descended to the arena to invite Vice President Curtis to give a speech (the speech will be detailed separately). Then the music sounded, and a chorus of ten people sang the Olympic anthem. At that time, the Olympic flag was raised. At this time, ten salute shots were fired. The torch on the Olympic Tower, which included the venue, was ablaze. Two thousand doves, with national flags around their necks, flew over the sports arena. The arena was filled with a solemn and peaceful atmosphere. The music played a march. All of the national teams formed a semi-circle with the platform as the center, each with their flags facing forward. The American athlete Kana mounted the platform. With his left hand, he held the national flag, and with his right hand, he raised the Olympic oath. (We athletes, at the occasion of joining the Olympic Games, will respect the rules of sports, will follow the spirit of the knight in the games for the honor of our homeland, to participate in various sports with the honor of sports, this oath ...) More than two thousand athletes raised their right hands and recited the oath together. Then they circled the venue again. At 4:20 PM, the solemn opening ceremony of the Olympic Games ended.

<h3 id="e133">The Most Expensive Soup in the World <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ji</p>
<p>A guest came from Paris. I asked him…</p>
<p>(Paris is the most prosperous place under heaven. May I ask, in a restaurant, how much does the most expensive soup cost?)</p>
<p>The guest replied… (Perhaps, at most, it wouldn’t exceed fifty francs?) I said… (Fifty francs is far too cheap!) (Then, a hundred francs for a bowl, that soup is probably the most expensive in Paris?) the guest said with some embarrassment. I repeatedly shook my head, saying: (Still too cheap! In a prosperous place like Paris, a bowl of elaborate soup is only worth a hundred francs, that’s really too cheap!)</p>
<p>Hearing this, the guest was speechless, and asked for the reason. I smiled and said:</p>
<p>(One day, Zhiyao (Mr. Zhu Zhiyao is the wise nephew of Prime Minister Xiang) accompanied me out for a snack at a restaurant. As soon as I sat down and opened the menu, I suddenly saw a soup on the soup list called Sun Yat-sen Soup, priced at six hundred silver dollars. I was shocked when I saw it, stunned to the point of being unable to speak. After a long while, I repeatedly shook my head, feeling it was really too expensive. I was afraid this bowl of Sun Yat-sen Soup was the most expensive soup in the world!</p>
<p>(Later, there was no way around it, soup had to be drunk after all, so I ordered a cheaper soup from the soup list, which still cost five dollars. Tasting it, I also found it very boring, with not much flavor!)</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the guest was shocked and said:</p>
<p>(In a prosperous place like Paris, I have never seen soup worth five hundred dollars. I see that Shanghai's prosperity is advancing a thousand miles a day, and it seems that Paris is not as good as Shanghai! ) I listened and just nodded, not committing one way or the other. The expensiveness of the soup? Or the prosperity of Shanghai? This is my riddle.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Japan's Old Method <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Hen</p>
<p>Now that Japan has occupied the entire Manchuria, the military era is almost over, and we are entering an era of annexation. The so-called "Manchukuo" is just a clever trick to ease international tensions. In the minds of the Japanese, they can't wait to annex it as soon as possible. Therefore, in the past month, the movement to unify the four-headed government and the efforts to seize salt tax, customs duties, and postal rights have been proceeding simultaneously. Once the four-headed government is unified and the salt, customs, and post are all seized, the fate of the puppet Manchukuo will come to an end. It absolutely will not be prolonged for long, unless our government has the determination to recover it by force. Taking advantage of the fact that the volunteer army is now all over the Northeast, resolutely send troops to the Northeast, then Japan's dream of annexing Manchuria may not be realized. Now that the Japanese government is unifying the four-headed government, isn't it determined to establish a plenipotentiary government or a governor-general's office in Manchuria, and is the governor-general's office said to be very powerful? This is the old method of annexing Korea. They want to use the same method to deal with Manchuria. People will recall that the fall of Korea to the governor-general's office is as clear as if it were happening right now, because it hasn’t been that long. It was after the Russo-Japanese War that Korea completely became Japan's vassal state. Japan immediately took the opportunity to abolish the embassy stationed in Korea and re-established a governor-general's office, taking over all of Korea's diplomatic and internal affairs. However, the Japanese are extremely ruthless. Not satisfied, they took the opportunity to claim that the Korean king had secretly sent envoys to seek assistance from the Hague Peace Conference, and forced Korea to recognize the following conditions: (1) The governor-general has the power to guide the Korean government in its administration. (2) Laws and administration concerning Korea must be approved by the governor-general. (3) The promotion and demotion of high-ranking officials must be approved by the governor-general. (4) The governor-general may recommend Japanese people to be Korean officials, who shall be appointed by the Korean government. (5) Without the consent of the governor-general, no foreigners may be hired. Later, because of Ahn Jung-geun's assassination in Harbin, Japan added 20,000 police officers within Korea. Thus, on August 22nd of the second year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, the merger treaty was produced (Korea ceded all governing rights to Japan forever). This is a brief history of Japan establishing a governor-general's office before annexing Korea. Looking at it, which of the above five conditions is Japan and the puppet state lacking now? Even the police force is not lacking. There are 20,000 of them in Manchuria. The present Manchuria is exactly the same as Korea before the second year of Xuantong. It is only missing a governor-general's office (in fact, the governor-general's office already exists, only in a different name). Once the establishment is implemented, all the elements of annexation will be in place. It's just a matter of time. You traitors are still living in a drunken dream, willing to be puppets. Isn't that very sad?</p>

<p>— Xie Lu</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Songhu Incident, the number of villagers fleeing back has been in the thousands every day. They are displaced and miserable, and their state is beyond description. One day, I was waiting for a guest at Cixi Railway Station. I saw a young man in military uniform and leather shoes, with a suave demeanor. Standing beside him was a beautiful young woman, covering her face and sobbing, murmuring something incomprehensible. The young man looked tall and proud, smoking a cigarette indifferently, and said to the woman with a smile, "Go quickly, go quickly. Don't bother me." The woman said, "Last winter, you went to Jinzhou to join the volunteer army. More than two hundred and seventy people went with you. Some died in the artillery fire, and some died from the severe cold. Now that you have returned alive, how can you bear to abandon your wife and children and re-enter the hail of bullets? Our family has several acres of farmland outside the city, which is enough to support ourselves. Even if you don't think about me, don't you think about your white-haired, doddering old mother? Yesterday, when she heard of your return, she was overjoyed and hugged you and cried. Now that you have been out for one night, you want to go to Shanghai and join the volunteer army. Your ambition is admirable, but what will I say to your old mother if she knows? I'm afraid she will die of grief. Even if you become an unknown hero, you will be an unfilial sinner." She cried loudly after speaking. The young man said, "When national disaster is upon us, I can't take care of filial love and personal feelings. My mind is made up. Why are you nagging? Moreover, everyone must die. Dying under the window is like Mount Tai compared to dying on the battlefield, which is like a feather. But life and death are also predetermined. I used to be a shop assistant at a store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, earning no less than sixty or seventy dollars a month. Just because the powerful enemy is rampant and the Chinese people are living in a drunken dream, every time I read the newspaper, it makes me heartbroken. So I gathered more than two hundred and seventy comrades and rushed to the Northeast to join the volunteer army. At first, when I went to the battlefield, I was inevitably timid. After a long time, the fun suddenly arose. I even felt bored when I didn't fight fiercely with the enemy. Now, because of the severe cold in the Northeast, only one hundred and thirteen people have returned alive. Now the brutal bandits are even more ambitious, and they have invaded Shanghai-Songhu. I heard that the 19th Route Army can also fight back hard. If I don't go to the Northeast, I should also join Shanghai-Songhu, to deal with the brutal bandits. This is also the duty of every citizen. You should take good care of my mother and raise our son well. We'll have a good drink when we meet again in the future." At that time, the whistle sounded loudly. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo train had already snaked into the station. In the crowd, I only saw this volunteer youth jump into the train, waving his scarf to say goodbye to his wife.</p>

<p>— Zhou Shixun</p>
<p>In such hot weather, abandoning the clean and cool Yuyuan Road and sitting in a stuffy movie theater to watch a preview, I think this is the biggest sacrifice of my life. If the movie I'm watching isn't worth it, then this sacrifice won't be considered strange by others, but I may never forget it. Fortunately, this sacrifice is worth it.</p>
<p>The name of this film is "Love and Death." Produced by the Star Film Company, directed by Cheng Bugao. One of the main actors is Zhu Qiuhong, and the other is the very likeable little Zhang Zhiyun.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Imagery on the Yangtze River (Part 1) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>(1) The Flower Seller</p>
<p>I woke up at seven o'clock and saw from the window of a certain hotel in Xiaguan that four warships flying foreign flags were moored in the heart of the river. At the same time, the huge Wusong Jianglun steamer had also excitedly sailed in from the east. I was going to take this ship to Hankou, so I was washing my face in a hurry. Strangely, in the large mirror on the washstand, I saw a woman standing behind me. Her charming smile explained her intention. I hurriedly turned around and asked her, "What do you want?" She didn't answer, but picked two gardenia flowers from her handbag and gave them to me to smell. "Buy two fragrant ones, people going out need them," she said. As she spoke, her seductive, plump chest was gradually getting closer to me, so I had to say sternly, "Don't mess around, I'm about to board the ship. Don't you see who's here? Get out of here!" So she left unhappily, but she still had to walk into another room with a smile. When she walked out of the door, I seemed to see on her back: "Poor flower seller, I can't live by selling flowers."</p>
<p>(2) Passenger Life</p>
<p>The river steamer set sail, and I was already in the second-class cabin. The people seeing me off were looking at the ship sadly on the dock. The river wind was blowing into the cabin in gusts. The tea boy shouted loudly, "Machine gun is here!" Looking closely, I felt it was pitiful. It turned out that the so-called machine gun was just a bamboo pole more than a foot long. The muzzle only pointed at the gunner's mouth, and the bullets fired were real smoke bombs.</p>
<p>The opening of this machine gun aroused my interest in conducting a survey of the lives of passengers. So, after spending one hour and five minutes, I obtained the following statistics:</p>
<p>Playing mahjong: 28 people, reading newspapers: 15 people,</p>
<p>Reading magazines: 2 people, reading Infantry Drill Manual: 1 person,</p>
<p>Reading the History of Sexuality: 7 people (including 1 woman), washing clothes: 2 people,</p>
<p>Quarreling: 3 people, eating bread: 1 person,</p>
<p>Eating broad beans: 1 person, bragging: 6 people,</p>
<p>Operating machine guns: 74 people (distributed in 27 key locations),</p>
<p>Singing little songs while holding the railing: 1 person, writing statistical tables: 1 person</p>
<p>Note: The list above is limited to passengers, and the number of passengers looking at the river, chatting, sleeping, and going to the toilet is not included because they are countless.</p>
<p>The numbers on the right are based on my survey at the time. I am not responsible for any increases or decreases after the time.</p>
<p>I have not studied statistics, so the table is very sloppy.</p>
<p>Qian Ping. The male lead is Zheng Xiaoqiu. The main plot is to describe the sadness of a love triangle. The side plot is to highlight the errors of the marriage system. It's very ordinary, but after Bugao used his flexible and clever skills to direct it, it feels very tortuous and flavorful. Especially the aesthetic scenery, which has never been recorded in the Star Film Company, is even more eye-catching. Unexpectedly, in the midst of the storms and troubles of the Star Film Company, there would still be such a perfect product launched. This calm and composed attitude is also expressed in conjunction.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that Star will put more effort into "new" things in the future. Otherwise, one product after another will be like a machine turning, without any vitality.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Striking the Bell at the Old Temple (60) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Sixty-seven</p>
<p>(Go to the Northeast!)</p>
<p>(Take back the Northeast!)</p>
<p>These are new shouts that the old temple has never heard before... These shouts came from the hearts of the young people of the old temple, shaking the eardrums of all the people in the village, penetrating into the hearts of all the people in the village, causing all the people in the village to feel that (going to the Northeast) and (taking back the Northeast) had become a matter of course, believing that if they did not do so, they could not be considered Chinese people, nor could they be considered people of the old temple.</p>
<p>In the villages south of the Yangtze River, the popular motto is... (Good iron is not used to make nails... Good men do not become soldiers.) How could the people of the old temple not have been anesthetized by this kind of view of life? Why is it that now they not only approve of everyone becoming soldiers, but also want to deal with external violence on the battlefield? The thread of this psychological change is not difficult to find. Since the people of the old temple organized a self-defense group, they have already understood the greatness of the people's armed forces. Those bandits who cruelly tore up children not only dare not come again to rob, but they don't even dare to come and paste threatening letters, because of the effectiveness of life education, the people soon think of a country from a village. From the self-defense of the old temple, they jump to planning the self-defense of the whole country.</p>
<p>(Two people are too few, let's go together!) The young people with boiling blood said almost in unison at the meeting. Mr. Zhu spent a great deal of effort guiding us to use cold brains to command hot blood. He said... (Don't think it's too few that the old temple is sending these two strong men. In my opinion, these two people are no less than two million people. The mission of the old temple is to first fulfill its own responsibility, and then awaken one million villages across the country to fulfill the same responsibility. If each village sends two strong men, there will be two million elite soldiers, who can take on the mission of recovering the Northeast. If we send one more person, it can be considered that we are fulfilling one more responsibility, but at the same time, we are reducing the responsibility of other villages. Moreover, we must have a comprehensive plan to win. The farmland left behind by the village friends who have joined the army must be cultivated by us, and the entrusted old and young must be served and educated by us. Once we have spoken, it is difficult for even four horses to catch up. We must not issue blank checks to increase the worries of the soldiers defending the country, so I suggest that the quota for joining the army be temporarily set at two people, and if there is an urgent need in the future, it will be increased.) How are these two people to be allocated? There is no need to elect them. There are as many as thirteen people who volunteer. People</p>
<p>gave them a title, calling them the Thirteen Taibao of the Old Temple. The word "bao" (protect) has a broad meaning. What they protect is the entire Chinese nation, not the special interests of a few people. It is a little difficult to only send two of the Thirteen Taibao of the Old Temple. Some people advocate drawing lots. Some people advocate that the two young men with the fewest family burdens should go first. But the result is that none of the Thirteen Taibao are willing to stay at home. This is beyond Mr. Zhu's expectations! Mr. Zhu can call the young people to rise up, but he cannot call the young people who have already risen to sit down again. In the end, Mr. Zhu had to sacrifice his own proposal, and stepped up the training of the Thirteen Taibao day and night so that they could set off for the Northeast.</p>

<p>Selling Pressure Pervades, Market Sentiment Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday (30th) at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the bond market situation was such that due to numerous rumors in the market, public sentiment was weak, leading to a surge in selling. The demand and supply were vastly unequal, and all bonds uniformly declined. The market showed no signs of recovery. Prices fell sharply in the morning, and the decline continued, resulting in a significant drop compared to the previous day, ranging from one to two and a half yuan. In terms of market transaction volume, spot transactions totaled only 7,000 yuan. Futures trading remained active, with a total turnover of 4,895,000 yuan, of which salt tax bonds accounted for over one million yuan, and other bonds were around 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Sudden Drop in Cotton Yarn Market, Prices Plunge <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market suddenly turned weak, with prices falling sharply. Large traders aggressively sold off their holdings, and the market has stalled after fulfilling a large amount of demand. As a result, bearish sentiment has become more active, and pressure has increased. Rumors circulated in the market that several thousand bales of No. 16 Tianjin cotton yarn were being shipped to Shanghai for delivery in August. However, according to some investigations, this matter is still unclear. Checking the August futures market accounts, there were no extremely large sellers. Moreover, the prices are not very cost-effective. However, a certain short position in the distant months continued to increase its holdings. As for the Rongxinghao long position, it continued to buy in the near month. The long and short sides are fighting fiercely. In general, the price of 50 taels is likely to fluctuate greatly at some point. However, the situation of the Rehe military is still serious, and the snowstorm is spreading, which has a significant impact.</p>
<p>The recent drop in yarn reached two to three taels. Before the market opened, American cotton was flat, and rumors in the mid-session that a large amount of Tianjin yarn would be delivered in August caused a sharp drop of one tael. In the second and third sessions, the price fell by seven or eight qian, and the situation weakened further. All months broke the 50-tael mark. As a result, all months fell by one tael and seven or eight qian to three taels and two qian. The total volume of transactions was 46,550 bales. Jifeng sold 1,050 bales, Suilong 900 bales, Changji 600 bales, Taichang 1,350 bales, Yichang 3,100 bales, Changfeng 1,750 bales, and Dafeng 650 bales. Yugang bought 1,900 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, Shenchang 1,250 bales, Changyu 900 bales, Renfeng 1,050 bales, Yiyu 1,200 bales, and Senkang 600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Brand　Closing Price Change　Inventory</p>
<p>November　14.81 Drop 1.8 124,000</p>
<p>August　14.98 Drop 3.2 40,550</p>
<p>December　14.80 Drop 1.7 108,550</p>
<p>September　14.93 Drop 2.2 72,750</p>
<p>October　14.87 Drop 1.7 110,550</p>
<p>Total　456,400</p>
<p>The spot market has entered a stagnant state. The sale of spot yarn is still flat. It is found that various guilds bought about 600 bales throughout the day, and the price fell by five qian to one tael. The amount of yarn bought by various parties is listed below:</p>
<p>Changsha 300</p>
<p>Shantou 50</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 50</p>
<p>Inland 35</p>
<p>Guangdong 155</p>
<p>Total 590</p>

<p>The cotton market is firm because American cotton is stable and the sales of spot cotton in the market are smooth. All factories have demand, which has led to an upward trend in sentiment. Although the inventory of American cotton is abundant, the local cotton is surprisingly scarce. Therefore, although there are large short positions selling off in the marked cotton market, the market can still be maintained. However, most sellers believe that American cotton will still be difficult to rise significantly and will remain weak. Nevertheless, the local market in this port is unusually firm, and the future situation is lacking in certainty.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Shows Slight Variation. Before the market opened, the August market was very tight, calling for 2.7 qian. The distant month was flat. In the second and third sessions, the market was slightly weak due to the sluggish yarn market. As a result, August rose by five fen, and the distant month fell by 1.5 to 2 qian. The total volume of transactions was 73,600 dan. Taichang sold 3,200 dan, Yiyu 1,900 dan, Xiesheng 1,100 dan, Yuchang 1,400 dan, Yifeng 1,500 dan, Yuande 1 dan, and Ruida 1,200 dan. Yichang bought 3,000 dan, Yuanda 5,300 dan, Tonghe 1,400 dan, Renfeng 1,200 dan, Lichang 1,200 dan, and Shenchang 2,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>November 31.50 Drop 2.0 265,800</p>
<p>August 32.20 Rise 0.5 99,900</p>

<p>October 31.75 Drop 0.0 217,600</p>
<p>Total 836,600</p>
<p>There are no Open Sales for Cotton Demand. There have been no transactions for spot cotton. Yao cotton source is estimated at 100 dan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to a lack of sellers. Wall Street was strong and firm. Later, some bulls closed their positions, resulting in a rise of two to five pounds for futures and five pounds for spot. British cotton futures rose by five to eight points, and spot remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot rose by five points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pingguo'er rising by three rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi rising by three and five rupees respectively. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 29th).</p>

<p>New York, 29th telegraphs the cotton market conditions for the week: In the past week, there have been showers in the central and eastern cotton belts, causing fears of bollworm damage. In addition, the wheat and securities markets have been strong, and the business community is optimistic. As a result, raw cotton prices have suddenly rebounded. Trading on the cotton exchange has been relatively light at times, but trading has become more active when prices rise. Local and bank streets have made considerable additions. It is believed that representatives of the Bureau of Agriculture are still continuing to sell, with approximately 10,000 bales of October futures being sold daily. It is also heard here that Southern Cooperatives have sold spot cotton, and the amount of cotton sold to Europe and the Far East is quite large. The price will be settled after August 1, when the new cotton season begins. The method by which the Bureau of Agriculture will promote its inventory of 650,000 bales of cotton in the next season has not yet been determined, so buyers are afraid to buy in easily. At the same time, the cotton crop report is also very contradictory. An appendix of American cotton weekend statistics is on the left (unit: thousands of bales).</p>

<p>Yesterday, at more than ten rice shops on Rice Market West Road in South Shanghai, North Japonica rice was extremely difficult to sell, and the price fell by two jiao. Jiangsu and Tongbei Japonica rice also tended to decline. The decline in early and late indica rice from Qingjiao and Sisong became more prevalent, falling by about two jiao, due to sluggish buying interest. New goods were launched, and production areas reported softness. In the afternoon, another 38 shi of new Japonica rice arrived, and prices opened with a sharp drop of 5 jiao to 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about thirteen or fourteen boats arrived in North Shanghai. Trading on this street was not good. Changshu and Wuxi North Japonica rice were softer by one jiao, and the next smaller by two or three jiao. Early and late indica rice from the villages remained unchanged. The opening price in the morning was lower by one or two jiao, and the sales of cooked rice were also weak. The situation was declining. Although the arrival of Luyang pointed rice was rare, there was no change.</p>
<p>The new Japonica rice was similar to that in South Shanghai.</p>

<p>Saigon Rice Drops to Within Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market initially appeared soft and tired due to weak sales in recent days. Some cargo owners were eager to sell, so market prices recovered slightly. Subsequently, mainland buyers, seeing the market price recover slightly, planned to ship goods and bought more than 3,000 bags of new and old small-sized rice. Zhenjiang, Jiangbei, and villages on this street all made inquiries, and the market showed signs of activity, with prices also recovering. The market opened with 3,000 bags of small-sized rice, priced at 9.35 to 9.2 yuan, and 4,000 bags of old small-sized rice, priced at 9.1 to 8.8 yuan. In addition, 200 bags of Saigon rice were priced at only 9.95 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Sparse July Flour Delivery Volume <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for July flour. The total delivery volume throughout the day was very light. Only Huafeng delivered 7,000 bags of green wheat root flour, which was taken away by this street. The remaining factories had all purchased in advance on their own, so there were no deliveries. Currently, the sales of spot flour are active due to the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival mooncake season. Sales in various ports, both domestic and foreign, are lively. In addition, wheat prices have recently shown a declining trend, so the market for out-of-month flour is expected to remain strong.</p>

<p>The first batch of new black sunflower seeds, mostly Xu Kui seeds, arrived in the past two days and immediately opened at a price of 16 taels. As more batches arrive, the price will inevitably loosen. It is found that each shop still has old inventory. The current selling price for top-grade seeds is 16 taels, followed by 14 taels or so, and then 11 taels or so. The trend is stable.</p>

<p>Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Market Stabilizes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association held its market session. Due to relatively flat sentiment and the fact that it was Saturday, transactions were very sparse. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sugar was quoted at 14 taels 6.5 qian, and high-quality sugar at 14 taels 7 qian had few buyers, with a slightly flat trend. No. 14 raw red sugar rose to 12 taels 5 qian. Hong Kong old sugar No. 18 medium sugar was quoted at 15 taels 7.5 qian, all of which were in good demand. Taikoo Sugar B mark rose to 16 taels 3 qian, HX mark to 15 taels 3.5 qian, and HM mark to 14 taels 9 qian, with all transactions quiet. The company's current spot prices are B mark at 16 taels 5 qian, CW mark at 16 taels, DY mark at 15 taels 7 qian, HX mark at 15 taels 3.5 qian, HM mark at 14 taels 9 qian, H mark at 12 taels 7 qian, and O mark at 11 taels 5 qian. Trading houses showed little interest, so transactions were scattered and the market was not very active. Huaxinhao sold 1,000 bags of No. 14 raw red sugar at 12 taels 4.5 qian, which was quite popular.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port was even more sluggish. European and American silk weaving factories are all on summer vacation. Japanese silk and rayon are flooding the market, and there were no telegrams from Chinese silk being forwarded to Shanghai. Yesterday, only Shanghai Silk Factory purchased 15 bales of medium-grade B official grade 18-22 denier white filature silk spot at 485 taels, and Kechang purchased 12 bales of HK brand No. 234 Mianyang yellow silk at 380 taels.</p>

<p>40 Dan Sold, Price Rises Two or Three Taels</p>
<p>Since the new goods were launched, sales of Chang Tu silk from silk factories have been slow, and sales of spun silk factories have also been sluggish. Market prices have fallen repeatedly. It happened that French merchants took advantage of the cheap prices to hoard, and the market gradually became active. Yesterday, Xinfu and others purchased 40 dan of Chang Tu silk from a Wuxi silk factory at an opening price of 71.2 taels, an increase of two or three taels compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Brisk Trade in Green Tea <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various green teas, including Zhen Mei, Da Bang, Zhen Mei, and Xiu Mei, from incoming traders, were extensively purchased by major foreign firms such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Yihe, Jinlong, and Tongfu. The market was unusually lively, and the market prices for Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, Xiu Mei, and other varieties all tended to rise. The market for local Zhen Mei and Pearl Tea was also slightly firmer than before. The green tea market has gradually entered a better state. However, Qining black tea still has no significant progress.</p>

<p>The market for galvanized iron, regardless of British or American goods, has felt a shortage of goods since the Building Committee released a large number of spot goods. The industry, aware of this, and with financially wealthy trading houses taking the opportunity to hoard, has led to a gradual increase in spot prices. Currently, 48-gauge American goods are estimated at 15 taels 2.5 qian per dan, 38-gauge at 15 taels 7.5 qian, 33-gauge at 14 taels 7.5 qian, and 25-gauge at 13 taels 7.5 qian. British goods, 31-gauge 7-foot are estimated at 9 qian 2 fen per sheet, 6-foot at 8 qian 1 fen, 28-gauge at 11 taels 7.5 qian, 26-gauge at 11 taels 2.5 qian, and 24-gauge at 10 taels 7 qian. All standards are three fen to one tael and a half higher than before. However, customer sales have been unable to keep up recently due to the increased prices, so actual transactions have been unusually sluggish. It is found that only two or three hundred bundles have been sold in the market in the past three or four days. It is heard that exports are even more desolate. According to those familiar with this commodity, whether this commodity can stand firm after the price increase depends on how the overseas pricing will change in the future.</p>

<p>Since the Blood and Soul Corps bombed Yongchang Coal Company, warning the treacherous merchant Wu Jichang, most of the merchants in this port who specialize in selling Japanese coal for profit have been vigilant. The market trading yesterday was slightly restrained, and some of the more timid and those with more spot goods were willing to sell at lower prices. For example, Matsuura lump coal was sold yesterday for only 8 taels 2.5 qian per ton, Kanda lump coal for 7 taels, and Yuanchu lump coal for 5 taels. However, there were still few buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Northeast National Salvation Army Command Headquarters <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Office Established</p>
<p>Affairs Temporarily Handled by Wang Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Since the Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces on September 18th, they initially sought to invade Shanghai and then coerced and enticed traitors to establish a puppet state. Zhu Jiqing, a member of the Central Committee, originally from the Northeast, disguised himself and secretly went to various parts of the three northeastern provinces several months ago. He systematically and methodically contacted local people who had spontaneously organized national salvation armies, volunteer armies, and self-defense forces, and organized the Northeast National Salvation Army Command Headquarters to facilitate long-term resistance against Japan. Zhu returned to Nanjing on the 18th of this month and immediately came to Shanghai to seek assistance from various parties and to negotiate everything. In order to facilitate contact with all parties, the headquarters specially established an office in Shanghai. All affairs of the office are temporarily handled by Wang Zhiyuan, the former propaganda director of the 19th Route Army. The office has established various departments, including an economic committee, a propaganda committee, a transportation committee, and a secretariat, and is now actively engaged in carrying out its work. The situation in all aspects is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Central Government's Assistance: Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, believes that Zhu's trip out of the customs to inspect everything in the three northeastern provinces for three months, despite the hardships and dangers, and to organize the Northeast National Salvation Army, organizing and training the scattered and undisciplined people there, deserves full assistance. His subordinate troops are divided into the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Route Armies, each route army is divided into three detachments, and each detachment has about two divisions. It is estimated that there are a total of 150,000 people in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>Attitude of the 19th Army: The 19th Route Army expressed great sympathy for Zhu Jiqing's efforts to contact volunteer armies in various places and his determination to resist Japan. In addition to sending representatives to contact Zhu and reporting on the army's military plans during the Shanghai war, they also promised to provide material assistance. They were particularly impressed by the bravery of Wang Delin's volunteer army in Jilin in fighting the enemy.</p>
<p>Economic Committee: The Northeast National Salvation Army Command Headquarters, recognizing the lack of ammunition and pay for the volunteer armies in the three northeastern provinces, believed that no matter how hard the volunteer armies fought, if there were no adequate preparations or assistance in terms of supplies, the result would inevitably be failure. Therefore, it specially established an economic committee in Shanghai to handle all economic matters and appointed well-known figures from various places to work together to advance the effort. The committee was established on July 30th. Those present included Tang Jicang, Wu Shan, Yin Ruli, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yu Buju, Liu Houwu, Wang Zhiyuan, Guo Juru, and dozens of others. Wang Zhiyuan was publicly elected as chairman to report on the establishment of the army's Shanghai office and the fundraising situation of the economic committee. Subsequently, Chu Fucheng, Yin Ruli, Li Cishan, Yu Buju, Tang Jicang, Wu Shan, Liu Houwu, and others expressed their opinions and had considerable ideas on how to assist the volunteer armies in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Propaganda Committee: The members of the committee are Wang Lixi, Xia Qifeng, Zhu Pu, Zheng Jijie, Xie Bainian, Cai Youmin, Li Yiwei, Li Wude, Chen Kan, Liu Shumo, Xu Zhiyuan, Qiao Yifan, Huang Weizhong, Zhuang Zhuoying, Zheng Jingqu, Liu Xuanzui, Fu Wumen, etc. The committee decided to establish a news agency and organize a Northeast Problem Research Association, inviting people from all walks of life in Shanghai to specialize in studying the Northeast problem.</p>
<p>Transportation Committee: The members of the committee are Ding Zhenheng, Lu Yinquan, Chen Xinghan, Cao Jitang, Li Zhiping, Yao Tezhuo, etc. They are currently engaged in handling transportation affairs in various parts of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Organization and Troops: The organizational system of the Northeast National Salvation Army is led by the Commander-in-Chief, who is in charge of the entire army. Under the Commander-in-Chief, there are commanders of each route army, and then detachment leaders (below the detachment are divisions, regiments, battalions, and companies), guerrilla detachment leaders, and security detachment leaders. The detachments are responsible for frontline combat, the guerrilla detachments are responsible for disrupting enemy defenses, and the security detachments are responsible for maintaining rear security. The headquarters and the headquarters of each route army have military, political, financial, and security committees as design and advisory bodies. Each route army, each independent detachment, and each independent division are assigned a political and military special commissioner by the headquarters to represent the headquarters and be responsible for supervision and command. As of now, the established units include the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Route Armies, and Wang Delin's special route (Wang is the Eastern Route Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army). Each route army has two to three detachments in its combat force, and each detachment has two or more divisions. In addition, there are two independent detachments, twelve independent divisions, and several independent cavalry regiments and training regiments that do not belong to any route army. In terms of its actual strength, the combined forces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang total 150,000 people, with about 100,000 concentrated in the Liaoning-Ning area and about 50,000 in the Jilin-Heilongjiang area. Other troops are also being contacted or organized, and they must gradually become an organization to concentrate strength and complete the common mission of saving the country. The leaders of the armed people resisting Japan in the Northeast include Liu Chunqi (Liangshan), Ma Zidan, Bao Enpu, Meng Yuhua, Yang Jiuzhou, Zhang Zuoqing, Sun Yutang, Zheng Guilin, Li Ziyang, Wang Zemin, Liu Zhendong in the Liaoxi area,</p>
<p>Li Haifeng, Huang Tieshan, Jin Ziming, Gao Pengzhen (Tizi), Gao Zhonghua, Zhang Guowei, Sun Yutian, Yu Mingzhong, Li Leting, Wang Zhaopan, Fan Junchen, Lao Beifeng, etc. In the Liaodong area, there are Liu Kejian, Wang Quanyi, Li Juchuan, Wang Yamin, Liu Xiangge, Zhong Zichen, Wang Ruiwu, Tang Juwu, Deng Tiemei, Li Zirong, etc. In the Jilin-Heilongjiang area, there are Wang Delin, Wei Shimin, Li Haiqing, Yu Zuosheng, Wu Fangqiu, Chen Deshun, etc. Among these people, some are local gentry, some are heads of local militias, some are leaders of bandits, and some are retired military and police officers. Most have joined the National Army and the National Salvation Army. Others who call themselves volunteer armies or self-defense forces all agree with the general headquarters' consistent stance and actions, such as destroying the Sujiatun station of the South Manchuria Railway, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, and attacking Liaozhong County, Yixian County, Jinxi County, and Beizhen County. They can all disregard their own safety and lead the people forward. Their strong patriotism is truly admirable.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Chinese and Japanese Armies: The Japanese army has two major shortcomings in its operations in the Northeast: (1) The battle line is too long. The Japanese army occupies no less than five to six thousand miles of railway lines, and the area on both sides of the railway is our territory. Its battle line is more than ten thousand miles long, making it difficult to coordinate everything; (2) It cannot fight scattered battles. The Japanese army is good at joint operations of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and air force, but it has never used a single type of soldier to fight. It feels very tired of running around against our guerrilla-style scattered battles. Moreover, during the sixth, seventh, and eighth months of the lunar calendar, dense sorghum and trees are everywhere in the fields, which is tantamount to creating natural hiding places for us, which is enough to give the Japanese army a fatal blow. However, at the same time, we also have two major shortcomings: (1) Lack of ammunition. Ammunition is the most necessary thing for combat, but the ammunition used by the armed people in the Northeast is extremely scarce. If this continues, we will inevitably lose our combat effectiveness; (2) Uncoordinated command. There are about hundreds of thousands of volunteer soldiers in the Northeast. The so-called volunteer soldiers refer to the armed forces resisting Japan, which can be divided into two types: formal army and armed civilians. The troops of Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, etc. belong to the former, and the National Salvation Army, the Volunteer Army, and the Self-Defense Army, etc. belong to the latter. This type of armed civilian is untrained, large in number, complex in situation, vast in area, and inconvenient in transportation. It is often difficult to achieve effective command in combat against the enemy. Regarding the second point, people of insight from all walks of life are working hard to improve it. The current situation is gradually becoming unified. Regarding the first point, it is indeed an extremely serious problem. It is hoped that the central government and compatriots at home and abroad will pay close attention to it and provide full assistance. Then the enemy will be exhausted and unable to govern peacefully. If we continue to work hard and persevere to the end, I believe that there will be a day when we will regain our sovereignty.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation: After Zhu returned to Nanjing from the three northeastern provinces, he immediately went to Shanghai. All young and ambitious people rose up at the news and petitioned to go to the Northeast to participate in the volunteer army's operations. In order to commend the enthusiastic uprising of young people, Zhu has allowed them to be sent to the Northeast in batches. Two trains departed from Nanjing last week and one train will depart this Friday. Zhu is expected to return north next Monday, and it is said that there will be dozens of people accompanying him.</p>

<p>Second Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Opinions on the Silver Content of the New Currency Remain Divided</p>
<p>It Was Decided to Hold a Third Meeting on the 3rd of Next Month to Discuss</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Research Association for Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan held its second meeting at the Central Bank at 2:30 pm yesterday and adjourned at 4:15 pm. It was decided to hold a third meeting next Wednesday. Chen Jian'an, the chairman of the association, went to Song's residence on Qiqi Road after the meeting to report the progress of the meeting to Finance Minister Song.</p>
<p>Committee Members Present: The committee members present at yesterday's meeting included Chen Jian'an, Bei Songsun, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Bijiang, Geng Aide, Mai Zhaote, Lei Qi, as well as Ma Jiliang, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hu Mengjia, representative of the Bankers' Association, Yu Zuoting, representative of the Money Dealers' Association, and Coxon (manager of Jardine Matheson), representative of the Western business community, a total of eleven people.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: The meeting started at 2:30 pm and adjourned at 4:15 pm. Chairman Chen Jian'an continued to discuss the issues that were not resolved at the last meeting. The representatives of the committee members present all expressed their opinions. After the meeting, the reporter of the Central News Agency learned through various inquiries that the meeting yesterday had not yet reached a consensus. The point of contention was still the silver content of the new currency. At the last meeting, some people advocated casting new coins in accordance with the currency system regulations of the third year of the Republic of China. Although the government would bear significant expenses, it seemed to be the government's obligation to seek permanent benefits and convenience for the people. However, another group believed that the government's burden of casting costs might be overwhelming under the current circumstances, so they advocated reducing the silver content. Because the above two opinions could not be reconciled, the first meeting did not produce a result, and it was agreed to continue the discussion yesterday. During the three-day recess, although various parties had consulted and communicated, the parties had not yet reached a consensus. Some Westerners also expressed their opinions, saying that since the government is determined, it should seek a thorough result. Although the government cannot raise the 30 million casting fees at once, it can cast in batches. The above-mentioned 30 million is the cost of casting all new coins, but in fact, it can be cast in batches. However, the silver content of the new currency must not be reduced again, otherwise all old coins must be melted and recast. In this case, the casting cost will be more than 30 million. If the fineness of the new and old coins is not uniform, not only will the purpose of reorganizing the currency system not be achieved, but there will still be trouble in foreign exchange and even greater impact on international trade. Since there were new opinions at the meeting, it was even more difficult to make a decision. Moreover, this meeting is for research purposes, soliciting unanimous opinions for the government to adopt. If a consensus cannot be reached, various opinions must be conveyed separately for selection. Since the two sides did not get closer, it was decided to continue the meeting at a later date. During this recess period, all parties are expected to continue to liaise.</p>
<p>Report to Song: Chen Jian'an, the chairman of the association, went to Song's residence on Qiqi Road at 5 pm yesterday to pay a visit to Finance Minister Song and report on the progress of the meeting that day. He left after talking for about 20 minutes. According to Chen's statement to the reporter, today (i.e., yesterday's meeting), because the opinions of the members and representatives were not yet unified, there was no resolution. It is now scheduled for next Wednesday (August 3) to hold the third meeting at the Central Bank to continue the discussion.</p>

<p>Received Li Fusun and Zhang Gongquan in the Morning</p>
<p>The Blockade of Maritime Customs Is Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen came to Shanghai from Nanjing and caught a cold on the way. After being diagnosed and treated by Dr. McKinley, he had recovered by yesterday. At 9 am, Song received Li Fusun, president of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, at Wan, and at 10:30 am, he received Zhang Gongquan, president of the Bank of China. They both talked for several tens of minutes before leaving. It is reported that the discussion focused on the urgent need to raise military expenses. In the afternoon, those who visited included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, former arsenal director Guo Chengen, and former Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, among others. Chen Xing, deputy governor of the Central Bank, also went to see Song after the Research Association for Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan finished and reported on the progress of the meeting. Song summoned Meierhe, the chief of the General Taxation Department, to talk. Meierhe only sent someone to present a letter to Song, but Meierhe himself did not go to Song's residence. Regarding the blockade of the Northeast Maritime Customs, reliable sources revealed yesterday that not only had the order and declaration not been drafted, but also the relevant liaison procedures had not been completed. However, the blockade must be carried out, and the only question is when. However, it is difficult to implement the blockade on August 1.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The First Batch of Postal Workers From the Northeast Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Originally One Hundred and Three People This Month</p>
<p>Only Seven People Arrived Due to Japanese Searches</p>
<p>After the Japanese instigated rebels to seize postal rights in the three northeastern provinces, the Ministry of Communications announced the blockade of postal services in the Northeast and ordered postal workers in the area to leave their posts and enter the pass to report to nearby post offices in order to find ways to resettle them. Therefore, after receiving the order to blockade postal services in the Northeast, postal workers from various bureaus in the Northeast tried to change clothes and enter the pass. The first batch of postal workers entering the pass arrived in Shanghai on the Fengtian Maru at 5 pm yesterday. The details of their arrival in Shanghai are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: The Shanghai Postal Administration received a telegram from the Qingdao Postal Bureau yesterday morning reporting that the first batch of 103 postal workers from the Northeast would arrive in Shanghai on the Fengtian Maru on the afternoon of the 30th. Therefore, the bureau sent postman Wang A'gen with more than 30 postal workers and three trucks to the port on time to take care of the luggage of the postal workers arriving in Shanghai. Those who arrived at the port yesterday to welcome the postal workers included Shanghai Postmaster Zha Peilin, Deputy Postmaster Wu Yu, Inland Deputy Postmaster Wu Xi, Mail Postmaster Yan Nuo'an, Liaoning Deputy Postmaster Liu Yaoting, and Postal Workers' Union representatives Xu Duo and Lin Bingyu, about 40 people in total.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Arriving in Shanghai: Originally, there were 103 postal workers in the first batch coming to Shanghai. Because some were searched and detained by the Japanese army along the way, or had already reported to the post offices in Pingjin, only seven people, including family members, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They include Gao Zongwen and his wife from the Liaoning District, Zhong Dating and his wife, Hua Cenhai, Zhang Hua and Li Xian from the Heilongjiang-Jilin District.</p>
<p>Entering the Pass: The reporter of the Central News Agency met with the postal workers who came to Shanghai yesterday and asked about their experience of entering the pass. According to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li from the Heilongjiang-Jilin District, after the Harbin Post Office received the instruction from the Ministry of Communications to blockade postal services in the Northeast on the night of the 25th, the postal workers of various post offices packed their luggage that night and prepared to enter the pass the next day. At that time, four Japanese postal workers in the Harbin Post Office saw this and immediately notified the Japanese authorities. Before long, Japanese police were densely deployed around the post offices, prohibiting postal workers from leaving the bureau. The situation was unbearable. Therefore, the first to escape from the Heilongjiang-Jilin District, except for the two of us, are probably still trapped. As for our experience of entering the pass, we obtained the secret assistance of a secretary in the local American consulate. The two of us changed clothes and took a car to Changchun on the morning of the 26th, and then took the Fengtian Maru via Dalian to Shanghai. From Harbin to Changchun, the car was searched twice by the Japanese police. If there was a slight misunderstanding in the conversation, they would be detained. From Changchun to Dalian, we were interrogated three times on the ship. In short, within the scope of the Japanese army's power, all kinds of oppression cannot be described in words. As for the postal workers in the Heilongjiang-Jilin District who have not entered the pass, it is not known when they will be able to start their journey due to various environmental obstacles. According to Mr. Gao, a postal worker from the Liaoning District who came to Shanghai, the difficulties of entering the pass and the barbarity of the Japanese army have long been seen by Chinese and foreign people. It is undeniable that our colleagues were subjected to searches and humiliation by the Japanese side. Because there are thousands of postal workers in the Northeast who are eager to go south, I don't want to add more details to increase the danger for the postal workers left outside the pass when they enter the pass in the future. After the postal workers got off the ship, they shook hands with all the welcoming personnel one by one before taking the car to return to their private residences to rest.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Bureau: After the postal workers from the Northeast arrived in Shanghai, they originally intended to report to the general bureau immediately. However, because they arrived in Shanghai yesterday, it was past office hours, and today is Sunday, so they decided to report to the bureau tomorrow morning and pay a visit to Director-General Huang Naishu to report in person on the situation after the postal services in the Northeast were seized.</p>
<p>More to Come: After the arrival of the first batch, there will be more batches coming to Shanghai soon. It is also learned that some postal workers who have left their posts have been detained by the Japanese police, who have coerced and lured them to work as inspectors, specializing in inspecting postal workers entering the pass. A postal worker named Shen has been detained as many as three times and is still not out of danger.</p>
<p>The Appearance of Counterfeit Stamps: According to the postal workers from the Northeast who arrived in Shanghai, the counterfeit stamps issued by the rebels had already been printed and were scheduled to be sold on August 1. The appearance of the stamps featured pagodas or Puyi's image, and the colors varied. The denominations were one cent, two cents, five cents, and one dime.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Arrived <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Transshipment Companies Refuse to Load</p>
<p>The Japanese Postal Company's Tsukuba Maru imported 16,745 pieces of Japanese goods, including several hundred pieces of American cotton and a batch of cement. The rest were all Japanese goods, mostly piece goods, but also a lot of groceries. The Mikasa Maru also transported more than 6,900 pieces. Yesterday, they were all unloaded at the two wharves of Huishan Post Ship. Some of the goods will be transshipped to Hankou by the Nisshin Maru.</p>
<p>In view of the large number of inferior goods, the transshipment companies along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway convened a meeting of their peers and unanimously refused to load the goods for railway transport. They also notified all their peers not to be confused by the consignors' attempts to mix in goods when loading, and that each company should be responsible for paying attention to inspections to avoid mixed transport.</p>

<p>Declaring No Fundraising</p>
<p>Warning to Chinese Stores: A Chinese store across from the Nanjing Road Continental Commercial Building received a warning letter from the "Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad" at 5 pm yesterday (the 30th), along with a bomb. The letter reads as follows: "Chinese Store, be informed, immediately stop selling all Japanese goods and publish a statement in the newspaper to show your sincerity. We are leaving a bomb as a warning. Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad, July 30."</p>
<p>Warning to the Brokers' Association: After the squad warned the yarn and cloth exchanges with bombs, almost no one asked about Japanese yarn and cloth. Some merchants, disregarding the overall situation, raised the price of domestic cotton yarn sharply, which affected the sales of domestic cotton yarn. The squad also sent a letter to the yarn and cloth exchange warning them. The letter reads as follows: "Our squad, in this time of national crisis, believes that every citizen has a duty to do their part, and therefore does not hesitate to sacrifice everything to strictly suppress treacherous merchants who buy and sell Japanese goods, in order to achieve the purpose of saving the country and the people. Unexpectedly, Zhang Yuchang, broker No. 27 of your exchange, and Xu Yongnian, broker No. 56, raised the price of domestic cotton yarn sharply at a time when Japanese goods were disappearing from the market due to the boycott. Such disregard for the overall situation and arbitrary monopoly has led merchants who only care about profit to regard domestic cotton yarn as a dangerous path and have to engage in the business of inferior goods. Their crime is no less than that of treacherous merchants who sell Japanese goods. They should be severely punished immediately. Considering that this is their first offense, we hereby issue a solemn warning. We hope that your exchange will forward this to all members for their information. In the future, do not raise the price of domestic products, otherwise the bullets are merciless, do not try lightly. To the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers' Association, Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad, July 30."</p>
<p>Declaring No Fundraising: The squad's purpose is to eliminate treacherous merchants who sell Japanese goods. It does not raise funds from the outside world, fearing that unscrupulous elements will use the squad's name to extort money. It has specially engraved a seal and sent a letter to this newspaper declaring: "(Letter 1) Dear Sir, in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from borrowing our squad's name to engage in extortion or other illegal activities, we have specially engraved a seal with the text 'Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad', which will be used from July 30. Any document that does not bear our squad's seal in the future is a forgery. We hereby inform you and ask for your attention. To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad, July 30, attached seal one."</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"(Letter 2) Dear Sir, our squad is purely organized by patriotic volunteers and has extremely strict discipline. Our only purpose is to eliminate treacherous merchants who sell Japanese goods. The squad's expenses are entirely raised by the comrades in the squad and we do not raise funds from the outside world. In the future, we will not be responsible for any fundraising or fraud in the name of our squad. Please pay attention to this. To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad."</p>
<h3 id="e165">Yesterday's Press Visit <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>To the War Zone's Epidemic Prevention Work</p>
<p>The War Zone's Sanitary Facilities Are Still Good</p>
<p>Significant Results in Preventing Cholera</p>
<p>The Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, jointly organized by the Health Department and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, has achieved remarkable results in handling health and epidemic prevention matters in the war zone since its establishment. During this hot summer, severe epidemics are prevalent, especially in the war zone. Because of the effective epidemic prevention, as of yesterday, 161 cases of true cholera had been discovered in Songhu, Baojia, Taikun, etc., with 94 deaths. Yesterday, the Health Bureau and the Epidemic Prevention Group of the Rehabilitation Committee specially invited the press to visit the health and epidemic prevention work in the war zones of Songhu, Jiabao, and others. They departed from the Health Bureau at 10 am yesterday morning and returned in the evening. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng's Speech: More than 30 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers gathered at the Health Bureau at 9:30 am yesterday morning. Director Hu Hongji introduced Health Minister Liu Ruiheng, who gave a speech, saying: "Unfortunately, the country is suffering from frequent disasters, including internal strife, red bandits, floods, national wars, and epidemics, to name a few. Cholera is especially rampant, from Nanchang and Baiyue to Pingjin in the north, and from the coast to Yichang in the Yangtze River Basin, and the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Suiyuan in the northwest. There are many deaths, so we should pay close attention to prevention. The Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, which I am in charge of as director and Director Hu Hongji as deputy director for Shanghai and Jin Baoshan as deputy director for the four counties of Baojia, Taikun, has been engaged in epidemic prevention work for six weeks. As of yesterday, only 161 cases of true cholera had been discovered in the four counties of the inland combat zone, which can be said to be a result of serious prevention. Epidemic prevention work includes preventive injections, well water disinfection, and epidemic prevention propaganda, etc. Analyzing cholera, it is truly a disease that enters through the mouth. Therefore, even if we do our best to give injections and disinfect, if we do not make the lower-level people understand the importance of cleanliness in their diet, we will still not be effective. Therefore, among the three, propaganda is the most important. I would like to express my gratitude for the energetic propaganda given by the press in the past. In the future, please continue to pay attention to arousing the lower-level people to pay attention to cleanliness and resist disasters together. Please visit various places to see that the epidemic prevention work is not lax."</p>

<p>After Mr. Liu Ruiheng's report on the tour's itinerary was completed, the tour commenced at 10:15 AM, with the following schedule: Depart from the Nanshi Health Bureau at 10:00 AM; inspect the mobile clinic at 3 Hengfeng Road at 10:30 AM; observe the inoculation site at the Shanghai-Taiyuan Long-Distance Bus Station at 10:45 AM; at 11:15 AM, observe the water disinfection efforts by the Boy Scouts in Dachang; proceed to the inoculation team in Luodian at 12:00 PM; visit the Jia Ding Plague Hospital at 12:45 PM; have lunch and rest at Kuishan Park in Jia Ding from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM; proceed to the Baoshan Plague Hospital at 3:30 PM, where they would be received by Mr. Wang Qingtao, the District Chief of Baoshan First District, who would show them around the area; observe the Wusong mobile clinic at 4:00 PM; observe the disinfection of the river at Baziqiao at 5:00 PM; and at 6:00 PM, visit the Health Bureau's Health Laboratory (189 Guangdong Street, Qiujiang Road) to observe their various projects and watch a health-related film.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the War Zone: The areas visited yesterday included Zhabei, Baoshan, Jia Ding, and Wusong. Zhabei remained a scene of ruins and devastation, with remnants of the past still visible. The recently recovered areas, such as Liuying Road, Yokohama Road, and Tongji Road, had not yet been restored and were sparsely populated. Only small groups of two or three scavenging children were occasionally seen passing by. Baoshan also suffered significant losses, mostly indirectly. Since its recovery, major efforts have been made to reorganize the area, but the damaged buildings have not been restored due to financial constraints. The population has also decreased by 30-40%. The area outside the East Gate of Jia Ding suffered the most from looting, while remnants of wartime activity could still be seen on Dongda Street in the city. Kuishan Park had been used as a garrison by the Japanese troops, who caused damage before their departure, a destruction of beauty that was deeply regrettable. The other areas suffered only minor damage. Only Yuncaobang in Wusong was relatively bustling, while the town itself remained a field of rubble. Residents who had lost their homes had built makeshift grass huts in Yuncaobang to provide themselves with shelter, a truly pitiful sight.</p>
<p>The Epidemic Prevention Situation: When the reporters first arrived at the mobile clinic on 3 Hengfeng Road, they found one doctor and three female nurses, who were administering free vaccinations against epidemics. On average, they could vaccinate one hundred people per day. They then proceeded to Dachang, where they found the No. 1 Team of the 65th Regiment of the Boy Scout Firefighting Corps, consisting of nine members, working in Baoshan. The No. 1 and No. 5 Districts had already been completed, and they were now working on the No. 3 District. They then proceeded to Luodian, where the people were resistant to vaccination due to their ignorance. The inoculation team had to patiently persuade them before they would agree. The Jia Ding Plague Hospital was better equipped, with three or four doctors and nurses. It had opened on the 2nd of this month and had already admitted fifty plague victims. More than thirty had recovered, and six had died (two of the six were already dying when they were brought to the hospital, and three were addicted to opium and therefore difficult to treat). After lunch, they went to the Baoshan Plague Hospital, which had similar equipment to the Jia Ding Hospital, but was scheduled to open the following day. They then inspected the Shanghai-Wusong war zone and visited the Zhabei Health Laboratory (where they were guided through the various health laboratories by Director Cheng Shuzhen and shown health films and films about the lab's production of smallpox vaccine (the lab's vaccine is available for sale).</p>
<p>The tour ended at 6:00 PM. Overall, the health work in the various districts was quite complete, but the areas were vast and the number of staff was small, so it was feared that it would be difficult to cover the entire area.</p>

<p>Discussing Countermeasures</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate Prepares to Negotiate with Us</p>
<p>A Meeting on the Current Situation Resolves Five Measures</p>
<p>According to the Shin Wen News Agency, after the Yongchang Coal Company on Xinzha Road was warned by the "Blood Soul Assassination Squad" for privately importing Japanese coal, various Japanese businesses in Shanghai that had dealings with the Japanese side became panicked and stopped trading with the Japanese. The Japanese Cotton Yarn Association and the various road business associations, fearing that this would be a major blow to their large-scale dumping of Japanese goods and lead to a complete disruption of sales and a pile-up of inventory, sent representatives to the Japanese Consulate yesterday morning to meet with Consul Murai and request that he make a serious representation to our municipal government to effectively prohibit the activities of the "Blood Soul Assassination Squad." Consul Murai agreed to make a representation to our side within three days. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Japanese Current Situation Meeting also convened an emergency meeting at the Penglu Settlement Group to discuss countermeasures. The results were reportedly: (1) Urge Consul Murai to negotiate as soon as possible; (2) Organize a plainclothes detective team to secretly investigate the whereabouts of the "Blood Soul Assassination Squad"; (3) Reduce the prices of all existing goods for clearance sales; (4) Request the military authorities stationed in Shanghai to provide strict protection in the areas where overseas merchants reside to prevent any action by the "Blood Soul Assassination Squad"; and (5) Telegraph relevant markets in the country to temporarily suspend shipments to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Held General Membership Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Re-elected Seven Executive Committee Members and Added Seven Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>Resolved to Severely Sanction Fellow Traders Who Privately Smuggle Enemy Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Association held a general membership meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, with more than 200 members in attendance. Chairman Chen Songshen and Ke Ganchen presided over the meeting. The chairman gave a report, followed by the re-election of the executive and supervisory committee members, and the resolution of several important cases. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Chen Songyuan reported that today is the third general membership meeting of the association. He felt deeply honored and grateful that representatives from higher authorities and members had come despite the sweltering heat. He noted that the association had been reorganized on August 15th of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) and had now been in existence for two years. He was deeply grateful to the industry for not abandoning him and entrusting him with the position of chairman, but he feared that he was not capable of handling the heavy responsibilities. Furthermore, his other responsibilities prevented him from concentrating on association affairs, which made him feel even more ashamed. Therefore, since taking office, he had been conscientious and careful, seeking only to avoid mistakes and not seeking credit, so as not to disappoint the industry's trust. Now that the re-election was imminent, he hoped that everyone would elect someone more capable so that he could be relieved of his responsibilities and reduce his mistakes. This was his sincere request. The report on the handled affairs of the previous year had already been printed and distributed to the members, and he had already received their understanding, so he would not repeat them. As for the affairs of this year, he would report them to everyone and ask for their guidance. However, since the weather today was very hot and there was still the re-election and discussion of various proposals to be held, in order to save time and avoid having everyone sit in the heat for too long, he would select the most important items to present to everyone. The remaining items would still be compiled into a report and distributed to the members for their review. He noted that the most important tasks handled this year were five: (1) resistance to enemy goods; (2) fundraising for disaster relief; (3) collection of business tax on behalf of the government; (4) special establishment of a temporary interest-free loan office and allocation of funds to relieve compatriots in distress; (5) comforting the 19th Route Army. (The original report was very long and is omitted.)</p>
<p>Executive Committee Members Whose Terms Had Expired: The Executive Committee members whose terms had expired included Ke Ganchen, Li Xuechang, Zhu Shaoqing, Gu Ziquan, Zhou Rongsun, Xu Xueming, and Qin Lansheng - seven people in total.</p>
<p>Elected Executive and Supervisory Committee Members: The results of the election of the Executive Committee members were: Zhang Maorong received votes, Xia Xianting received 89 votes, Shi Yunmao received 87 votes, Fu Zhenyuan received 52 votes, Pan Yushu received 48 votes, Zhou Weishi received 41 votes, and Bu Bo received 34 votes. The alternate executive committee members were: Gao Jiyun received 34 votes, Zhu Mingqiu received 33 votes, Sun Xiaozhu received 29 votes, Li Shuiru received 24 votes, Ma Yinsun received 22 votes, Wang Jinru received 16 votes, and Huang Liyao received 14 votes. The supervisory committee members were: Ke Ganchen received 111 votes, Li Xuechang received 93 votes, Li Shaoqing received 72 votes, Gu Ziquan received 50 votes, Zhou Rongsun received 73 votes, Xu Xueming received 69 votes, and Qin Lansun received 69 votes. The alternate supervisory committee members were: Li Zhonghui received 22 votes, Yao Shanfu received 11 votes, and Deng Zhonghe received 7 votes.</p>
<p>Resolutions: The resolutions were as follows: (1) The final account for the 20th year of the Republic (1931) was approved. (2) The budget for the 21st year of the Republic (1932) was approved. (3) The proposal from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to organize a national crisis reserve fund was approved in principle. The specific measures were to be drafted by the Executive Committee, taking into account the specific circumstances of the industry, and then implemented. (4) A proposal to severely sanction the private smuggling of enemy goods and issue a statement to the outside world was approved. If any member was found to be privately smuggling enemy goods, after verification, they would be expelled from the association according to the rules, and a public announcement would be made in the newspaper for public judgment. The external statement was approved for publication.</p>
<p>Sanctioning Treacherous Merchants and Severely Sanctioning the Private Smuggling of Enemy Goods: After the Wan Xian Massacre occurred, the association convened a general meeting and resolved to establish an Economic Sanctions Against Japan Committee to be responsible for handling matters related to resisting enemy goods. When the Pan case occurred, they intensified their efforts, expanded their organization, reorganized the Economic Sanctions Against Japan Committee into the Cotton Cloth Industry Anti-Japanese Committee, and established inspection and investigation departments to cut off trade with Japanese merchants and strictly inspect smuggling. As a result, enemy goods disappeared from the market. In the past, the achievements of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have been praised in letters. This was all due to the enthusiasm of the entire industry, the efforts of the staff, and the dedication of the staff. They hoped to maintain this momentum and use it to put Japanese merchants to death. However, overnight, various anti-Japanese organizations were disbanded by explicit order due to unreasonable demands, and the anti-Japanese affairs of the industry were also effectively suspended. However, the association, in view of the great suffering of the people during the Shanghai War, deeply felt that the only way to seek self-preservation was to resist enemy goods, so it continued to persevere in its original purpose. On March 9th, May 3rd, and May 16th, it repeatedly sent letters to its members with earnest advice and employed specialists to secretly investigate the sealing of old goods and formulate measures for their disposal. In addition to requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to adopt them in order to circulate finance and preserve the capital of merchants, they printed "Volunteer Statements Not to Sell Japanese Goods" and distributed them to fellow traders to fill out in order to show their good faith and bind them. Everything within their powers was done to the best of their ability. However, due to the lure of great profits, many people rushed to smuggle enemy goods as their numbers grew. Only one-third of members joined the association, which made it difficult to popularize power and was hindered by lack of support. In order to resolve this, we are submitting it to the general assembly for resolution and severe sanction to be followed and to consolidate the front line of resistance.</p>
<p>Emergency Statement from the Cotton Cloth Trade Association: An urgent statement: Since the January 28th Incident, the association has repeatedly received letters and packages delivered by post, some signed as a part of the industry, the Sulphur Bomb Group, Feng Shengli, Wenye Gongqi, the Special Inspection Department of the National Salvation Corps, a member of the cotton cloth industry, an industry member, Bei Lifei Xiang Zhengqing, and the Blood Soul Elimination Group, as well as a letter left behind, attached with a tin of biscuits, with a handmade grenade inside. Upon reviewing the meaning of the letters, they all warned traders not to sell smuggled enemy goods again. All of the letters received by the association did not have addresses, so there was no way to reply. In addition to publishing the original letters separately in the market so that traders could be aware of them, we also sent a letter to the police station to take away the grenades to avoid danger. We also stated that the matter concerned the patriotic movement and we did not wish to investigate it deeply. Everything that was done was out of patriotic zeal, and who among those with blood and Qi would not deeply sympathize? However, the association is in this environment, and the difficulties of handling the process and measures are something that outsiders cannot fully understand. Here is a brief summary of the points: (1) The handling process. After the Wan Xian Massacre occurred, the association immediately convened a general meeting of members and resolved to organize a specialized committee for economic severance to be responsible for handling matters related to resisting enemy goods, and sent a letter to all members immediately stopping the purchase of enemy goods. As the Shen incident continued, the association strengthened its work, expanded its organization, added inspection and investigation groups, implemented inspection seals, strictly prevented smuggling, and enemy goods disappeared from the market. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter expressing appreciation. Afterwards, the anti-Japanese groups suddenly received an explicit order to dissolve, and the Jiaodaoji lost their strength greatly, however, in light of the horrors suffered by the people during the Shanghai war, and feeling that the only way to seek self-preservation was to come, the association repeatedly sent letters to members, urging them to take the overall situation into consideration and adhere to the bottom line and never be willing to be included in the ranks of treacherous merchants, and printed a vow not to sell enemy goods voluntary letter, which was sent to members to fill in to prevent duels and reveal credibility, while employing experts to secretly conduct investigations, and those who did not follow dissuasion were warned with strict letters, and if they still did not know how to repent, the final punishment was given to them. Wherever power can reach, we do our best.</p>
<p>(2) The difficulties of measures. The association is a trading group, so from its own position, it takes the members' wishes as its wishes, and the members' interests should be absolutely guaranteed. And the power is regulated by law, the way things are done should be put on the right track, can only be dissuaded and cannot be forced, if I go my own way, I will be in violation of the law and overstepping my powers, and the members who have joined the association only account for 25% of the total members of the association, so it is difficult to popularize the power and lack of support. In general, if things can be united and consistent, then no matter what difficulties are encountered, they will eventually be solved smoothly, otherwise, they will take care of this and lose that, and the person in charge will be exhausted and unable to help. However, the association loves the country and will never lag behind, and no matter what, we will still pursue our original intention, continue to work hard, do our best, seek peace of mind, and never change our minds. If we are blessed with Jia Mou from all walks of life, we will accept it as much as possible. This is a solemn statement, and we hope that you will be kind and clear.</p>

<h3 id="e170">China Merchants Electric Company <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoyi's Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Local Court Opened the Trial Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhu Shuyi's Previous Grudges</p>
<p>Fu Chongde Suddenly Suffers from Heatstroke</p>
<p>Lu Ji Yun Claims to Know Nothing</p>
<p>Zhu Shaoyi, the director of the transportation department of the China Merchants Electric Company, was sued because the dismissal of ticket seller No. 71 was opposed by the Trade Union of Water and Electricity Workers, triggering a strike. Leaflets and slogans were posted with various abusive words against Zhu Shaoyi, Zhu Zi, and Zhu Zhizai. Later, Zhu Shaoyi claimed that the slogans and leaflets did not represent the views of all the workers, but were advocated by Lu Jiyun of No. 3 and Che Chuan Chongde of No. 7. He then hired a lawyer to sue in the local court. After the prosecutor released Lu and Fu on bail, a public prosecution was filed, and the criminal court scheduled a trial for yesterday. The trial began at 12:00 noon yesterday in the third court presided over by Judge Huang Changyuan. Many workers were in attendance. Zhu Shaoyi testified that he was 55 years old, from Shanghai, residing at 135 Shengyi Lane, and the transportation director of the China Merchants Electric Company. He was suing Lu Jiyun and Fu Chongde for defamation, harming his reputation, and plotting against him. The methods of harm included issuing leaflets, posting slogans, placing excrement in cigarette cases in front of the company gate, and gathering people to guard the gate, all with the intention of plotting against and insulting him. He claimed that they were directed by these two people. Furthermore, his son was a staff member in the general affairs department and engineering division, and his duties were separate from his own. However, they compared his son and him to dogs in their propaganda and made up facts such as bribery. The judge asked who issued the leaflets. He replied that it was the drivers and ticket sellers, but the masterminds were the two of them. The judge asked how he knew. He replied that there were witnesses. The judge asked when this happened. He replied that on May 29th, they held a meeting at the Ningbo Hotel in the French Concession, and on June 1st, they issued leaflets, posted slogans, and attempted to harm him with filth. Therefore, he was afraid of danger and did not go to the company. On June 2nd, someone reported that Lu Jiyun was spreading rumors on the bus, saying bad things about him. When the passengers asked him why he wrote "all workers," Lu pointed to his chest and said that he was responsible and would not only defeat him but also treat him to snacks. Witness Ding Baoshan could testify. The judge asked if there was a union in his company. He replied that there was, and it was for workers, not for staff. However, inspectors represented the transportation director externally and were also staff members. In the past, they joined the union, and the company had no power to stop them. There were 700 people in the union, but only 300 in the transportation department. He had evidence, including a "Current Affairs News" newspaper, a declaration, a slogan, an urgent notice, and a "New News" tabloid. They were calling meetings, such as "drivers who don't drive will have their hats taken away" and "ticket sellers who don't sell tickets will have their ticket boxes taken away." He was one of the founders of the company and a shareholder, and everything was done according to the regulations, which inevitably made some people unhappy. As for Lu Jiyun, he was originally ticket seller No. 27 and was repeatedly promoted from ticket checker to scheduler and then to inspector. Later, when a staff position opened up in the transportation department, he submitted the names of three inspectors to General Manager Lu Bohong, but in the end, inspector No. 2 was promoted, and Lu resented him for not helping him. However, he only had the power to submit the names; he did not know anything else. Regarding Fu Chongde, he was originally a ticket seller from No. 41 and was promoted to scheduler. He was once a standing member of the union and had disputes when he represented the company at labor-management disputes. Later, Fu was arrested on suspicion of being a communist and blamed him for not protecting him, but he had no power to do so. Regarding ticket sellers Nos. 116 and 71, they were reported by ticket checkers for fraud. After review, it was reported to the General Manager, and then the director of the lighting department, Lu Zhonglin, was assigned to reinvestigate. Then the General Manager decided to dismiss the two, and some people took the opportunity to make trouble for him. However, on June 1st, the standing committee of the union made a statement to the manager and did not advocate for it. Later, they surrounded the directors' office, and ticket seller No. 71 was reinstated. He had been in business for 40 years and had never seen this kind of phenomenon.</p>
<p>The judge asked about the witnesses. He replied that they were Liu Fusheng, Ding Baoshan, Ling Jitan, Chief Liu, Lu Bohong, and Feng Liutang. The judge said that Feng had issued a statement saying that he knew nothing. He replied that they accused him of ten crimes, and Feng Liutang was still the interrogator.</p>
<p>Since there was no such fact at all, the matter was dropped. At that time, Feng was even more dignified than a judge, how could he come to write a letter claiming to know nothing? Because the company could not guarantee his safety, he sought legal remedy, and a group of workers published in the newspaper that they did not recognize them and immediately hit them. At this point, Fu Chongde suffered from heatstroke and returned home, while Lu Jiyun said that he was 37 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at 20 Longhua Road. He knew nothing about the union's disputes with Mr. Zhu and had no idea why he was being sued. Therefore, he answered "I don't know" to the judge's questions. The judge then ordered that</p>
<p>witnesses be summoned for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Failure of French Silk Merchants <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Impacts Chinese Silk Merchants</p>
<p>Yi Da Company Unable to Repay Debts</p>
<p>Banque de l'Indochine and British Bank File a Joint Lawsuit</p>
<p>Wu Yuntai, the owner of Yongda Silk Shop at 38 Avenue Edward VII, Tang Yeqin, the accountant of Jiucheng Silk Factory at 4 Xinkang Road, and Wu Shenbo are all well-known silk merchants in the city. They had previously pooled their capital to form Yi Da Co., Ltd., which specialized in exporting raw silk, mostly to France for sale. At the end of 1929, Dufour, a famous French silk merchant, went out of business and suddenly went bankrupt. The French silk market was greatly affected, and silk prices plummeted. The silk shipped to France by Yi Da Company was all accepted and discounted by Banque de l'Indochine. With Dufour's bankruptcy, the drafts could not be honored and became worthless paper.</p>
<p>The debt owed to Banque de l'Indochine, as of April 17th of last year, after deducting the deposit and other funds, still amounted to 137,966 francs, equivalent to 25,155.641 silver dollars. Yi Da was repeatedly urged to repay the debt, but Wu Yuntai and others all shirked responsibility, claiming that they were only directors of the company and were not responsible for the company's debt. Therefore, the debt had not yet been repaid. Banque de l'Indochine recently hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiahui, Ye Shaoying, and Chen Zhongyin to file a lawsuit against Wu and the other two, detailing the reasons why the defendants should be liable for Yi Da's debt, stating that whether the company was legally established at the time the contract in this case occurred was still to be proven, and even if it was legally established, Yi Da had invested all of its capital in silk purchased on behalf of Dufour at the end of 1929. Once Dufour went bankrupt, the remittance naturally could not be honored, and the defendants were well aware that the price of French silk had also plummeted at the same time. The defendants could not devise a good plan for the company's business, and they did not convene a shareholders' meeting to declare liquidation or file for bankruptcy at this time. What else were they waiting for? According to the above explanation, the defendants had violated Article 161 of the company regulations, the duties that directors should fulfill. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan No. 92 in the 18th year of the Judicial Yuan (1929), they should be responsible to the creditors. Therefore, they requested that the court immediately summon the defendants for trial and order them to be jointly and severally liable for the repayment. In addition to being sued by Banque de l'Indochine, British Bank has also recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court to recover debts. The subject of the lawsuit is exactly the same, so the two plaintiffs jointly requested the court to combine the two cases for trial to facilitate matters. Yesterday, Judge Shen Hong specially opened the 10th court to summon the two sides for final oral arguments and ordered them to leave and await the verdict.</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy investigating industries in various countries, had accumulated fatigue during his previous trips between Pingjin and Jinghan during the hot summer.

As a result, he was unable to depart as scheduled. A reporter visited his private residence yesterday to inquire about his condition. According to his doctor, Kong contracted influenza on the 25th. The initial condition was quite severe, with his body temperature rising to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. After treatment, it has gradually decreased. However, after the fever subsided, he felt weak, so he needs to rest for another week to recover. Therefore, Kong's departure abroad is likely to be postponed until mid-August.</p>

<p>Preparing Forms for Investigation and Verification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations, recognizing that during the recent Shanghai Incident, our anti-Japanese soldiers fought bravely, risking their lives in a desperate battle against the violent Japanese to defend Shanghai and protect the country, their功績功可耀日月而炳千秋 meritorious achievements could shine like the sun and moon and last for centuries. The deceased have already been reported to the government for preferential treatment of their families. However, the wounded and disabled are likely still groaning in various military hospitals. Therefore, at yesterday's standing committee meeting, it was proposed to investigate the current situation of the military hospitals in Shanghai and the number of wounded soldiers. Once completed, proper measures will be taken to comfort our anti-Japanese soldiers. The letter to the military hospitals is as follows: To whom it may concern, We have learned that some of the wounded soldiers who were injured in the Battle of Shanghai are being treated in hospitals, some have not yet recovered due to disabilities, and some are unable to return home due to the distance. Our colleagues are very concerned. Therefore, we have specially commissioned the students of Shanghai's universities' Self-Defense Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to appoint specialists to conduct detailed investigations in public and private hospitals in the Shanghai area, starting today, and submit a list for verification and processing. We hereby inform you and hope you will comply. To: All Military Hospitals, Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations. Attached is a form for investigating wounded soldiers.</p>

<p>Protesting the Change of Collection of Taxes to Silver</p>
<p>Letter Sent to the Public Works Department Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the General Office of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, which reads: To whom it may concern, According to a letter from the Shanghai Baohua Shoe and Hat Store, our store sent a letter to your association on the 9th of this month regarding the Public Works Department's change of collecting police donations in silver, requesting you to write a letter to negotiate the matter, and also sent a letter to the Public Works Department on the same day, urging them to correct the matter. On the 11th, we received a reply from your association, informing us that negotiations had been made, which we deeply appreciate. However, on the 18th, we received a reply from the Public Works Department, stating that they received our letter of July 9, questioning the bureau's changing the method of collecting donations without cause. In fact, the bureau is still collecting according to the usual practice and has not changed. Because the house where your store resides is of Western style, it must be valued in silver. The estimated price is 288 taels of silver per month, and the quarterly donation should be 120 taels, 9 mace, and 6 fen of silver. The foreign exchange rate is calculated at 7 mace and 2 fen. To avoid cumbersome procedures, 7 mace and 2 fen is set as the permanent standard. When collecting donations, it is calculated according to the market price of the day. If the foreign exchange rate falls and your store does not want to suffer losses, you can pay with regular silver. This kind of reply is completely contradictory and cannot convince people. Our store's rent is paid in silver dollars (400 yuan per month), and it should be calculated in silver dollars. However, the bureau abandons the simple and uses silver to pay the donation, and when pricing, it uses 7 mace and 2 fen as the permanent standard, but when collecting donations, it uses the recent market price (6 mace and 9 fen) as a temporary change. Even if we take a step back and recognize this contradictory method as the authority of the bureau, last year the foreign exchange rate was often above 7 mace and 2 fen, and the highest price was close to 7 mace and 3 fen. If the donation paid by our store was calculated at the market price of the day, the amount should be within 168 yuan, but why did the bureau collect 168 silver dollars per quarter without calculating according to the market price of the day or mentioning that regular silver of 120 taels, 9 mace, and 6 fen could be used to pay the donation? If this is the case, taxpayers only have to bear an extra loss of 168 yuan, without enjoying the benefit of 168 yuan, which is very unfair. We have attached a copy of the rent bill and the bureau's reply for your reference. After investigating the arguments of the store, we found that they were very reasonable and sufficient, while the reasons held by your bureau could not justify themselves. Because it is not based on fairness, it is difficult to convince people. The sharp fall in the foreign exchange rate means that your bureau's expenditures are mostly in silver, and the losses suffered are not small, but merchants and residents also cannot be exceptions. Moreover, when the foreign exchange rate was high, your bureau benefited from collecting silver dollars. Managing public undertakings should ultimately be simple. Going from simplicity to complexity, seeking petty profits, and harming others to benefit oneself is most inappropriate. Recently, the movement to abolish taels and use yuan is precisely to prevent this kind of currency instability, which often causes changes in people's income and expenditure. It is unbelievable that your bureau's wisdom has not seen this. However, in order to make up for the losses, your bureau has adopted this kind of inconsistent policy, which is understandable, but the matter is ultimately unfair. It is ultimately difficult to accept being convenient to oneself as the primary principle. Fortunately, the rent is calculated in silver dollars, so collecting the commonly circulated silver dollars is also convenient and simple. Why bother with repeated calculations, which lead to many disturbances? If your bureau's budget is indeed insufficient, there are ways to balance it. Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure are originally permitted by the facts. If you want to increase income and do it piecemeal, or even make each taxpayer's prosperity decline day by day, then the number of sufferers in society will gradually increase, and there will be more problems with public security. It is feared that the funds collected will not be enough to compensate for the increasing costs of maintaining public security. This association is not arguing for the sake of argument, but because of its deep love for public prosperity, it has to speak out earnestly. According to the above letter, we hereby request your bureau to calculate the Shanghai Baohua Shoe Store's municipal donation based on the rent of 400 silver dollars, and continue to collect 168 silver dollars per quarter.</p>

<p>Preparing to Commemorate Ye Zhuanjun</p>
<p>August 13 at the Miscellaneous Grain Guild</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, the Jiangsu Provincial Rice Industry Federation in Shanghai, the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Trade Association, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange, the Rice Shop Trade Association, and the Rice Milling Trade Association jointly organized a memorial service for Mr. Ye Huijun. Yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Guild. Since the soybean and rice industry guilds and the miscellaneous grain guild jointly elected Mr. Ye Huijun as chairman, and the government planned to establish a rice and grain inspection office that would collect 20 cents per stone, this matter was related to the people's livelihood. When our colleagues learned of this, they were extremely anxious and publicly requested Mr. Ye to go to Nanjing to petition the government and meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang to explain all the difficulties and ask the government to withdraw the order. Commander-in-Chief Chiang sympathized with the difficulties of the merchants and agreed to do so, and the order was immediately cancelled. Mr. Ye devoted himself to the association's affairs and made great contributions to the industry. Now, due to his death from abdominal tumor, all of our colleagues deeply mourn him. At the meeting, the colleagues elected Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, Cai Yukun, Fu Qiangeng, Jiang Zisheng, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Biquan, Jiang Hongbin, Chen Wenshao, She Bingwen, and others as members of the preparatory committee, and mutually elected Gu Xinyi as the director of the preparatory committee to handle the preparations. The venue for the memorial service was tentatively set at the Miscellaneous Grain Guild. It was decided that the memorial service would be held on August 13. The industry and the guild market would be closed for one day, and there would be a grand event at that time.</p>

<p>Plotting to Rob Ships off the Coast of Taizhou - Police Warning</p>
<p>Public Works Department Notifies All Shipping Bureaus</p>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Companies to Take Strict Precautions</p>
<p>After the Taikoo Suiyang wheel was hijacked by Dapeng Bay pirates, the British Navy stationed in Hong Kong sent a warship to the area and bombarded dozens of villages with cannons. Many civilians were killed, and the bandits were forced to retreat slightly and find other ways out. They secretly went to the waters off Taizhou, Zhejiang, hoping to hijack ships. This city received a warning yesterday and has telegraphed all ships to take strict precautions. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Secretly Heading to Zhejiang Waters The Dapeng Bay pirates have a large-scale organization. Major ports in Shanghai, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Tianjin have established informant networks to scout out merchant ships carrying large sums of cash, and then they plan to rob them. After their old nest was bombed by British warships, the bandits dispersed in all directions. Recently, they gathered again. However, given that Chinese and British warships are often stationed in the South China Sea for escort, making it impossible to rob ships, they managed to leave Dapeng Bay and head to the waters off Taizhou, Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Shanghai Receives Report On the 29th (Friday), the Shanghai Public Works Department received an urgent secret telegram from Hong Kong, which stated that the Dapeng Bay pirates had secretly left the area and were heading to places such as Taizhou Island and Sandu Bay in Zhejiang, hoping to hijack merchant ships. Please inform the shipping bureaus operating on that route as soon as possible to take precautions to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Takes Strict Precautions After receiving the Public Works Department's secret report yesterday, all Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this city immediately notified the ships on the Nanyang route to take extra precautions when passing through the waters of Zhejiang and Taizhou Island. The ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan route paid even more attention after receiving the report. They were very careful when passengers boarded the ships, and the onboard police were also on special alert. The ships en route were also notified by telegram. At the same time, the Shanghai Naval Headquarters was notified to use wireless telegraphs to inform the warships to patrol Sandu Bay and Taizhou Island to protect shipping merchants.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced that at the Public Works Department Board meeting, the General Manager reported that after the Water Company changed to a meter system, some places increased significantly compared to the previous lump-sum system. This matter is currently under investigation. It is proposed to ask the Board to allow water charges to be reduced during this period, but the condition is that the total income should not be reduced and the water rate table does not need to be increased. The General Manager reported at the meeting that the Water Company found that water consumption has greatly increased recently during the hot summer, so the owners of a large number of houses may have to pay a lot more according to the meter system. The company intends to ask for permission to give appropriate reductions in case of such difficulties. The General Manager's intention is that this proposal is a temporary measure. If it does not cause an increase in the water rate table, it seems permissible. After discussion, the directors resolved: 1. If no demands for compensation are made to the Public Works Department, 2. The company shall report the details of each household whose fees have been reduced each month, as well as the impact of the meter system on water consumption and the company's income. Then, the request for temporary permission to reduce fees can be approved.</p>

<p>Requesting the Cancellation of Telephone Rate Increase</p>
<p>Reasons Presented to the Public Works Department Yesterday</p>
<p>The Special Committee Against Telephone Rate Increase of the Citizens' Association decided at its second committee meeting to appoint Chen Binghui, Zhou Fuzhang, Zhang Xianfang, Zhuang Zhihe, and others to petition the Public Works Department to instruct the Telephone Company to cancel the rate increase. The representatives went to the Public Works Department at 10:00 AM yesterday. General Manager Johns of the Public Works Department was out, and He Dekui, the Associate General Manager, received them. The representatives stated four reasons: (1) According to the telephone company's notice of rate increase in the concession, this increase is due to the installation of automatic switchboards, but cities such as Hong Kong and Nanjing have also installed automatic switchboards without raising rates. (2) The association's petition to cancel the rate increase is based on the public opinion of the 3 million citizens in the Special District, as the association has been receiving letters from more than 6,000 users opposing the rate increase. (3) After the company installed the automatic switchboards, it laid off a large number of operators, so the expenses have been saved and are sufficient to compensate for the losses of the installation. (4) The association should ask your bureau to seriously note that the company must not take any action such as cutting off lines or removing machines before the association's negotiations are resolved. After the representatives finished speaking, Mr. He said that the company's rate increase this time is based on the proposal of the telephone expert An Sheng in 1929. Because An Sheng suggested to the company at that time that it should allocate 8 million yuan of capital from 1929 to 1932 for the installation of automatic switchboards. The capital has been fully used up by March of this year, so it is necessary to increase the rate for users by 25% to compensate. Your bureau has promised An Sheng's proposal in the past, and the company has gradually done so according to An Sheng's method, so the rate increase proposal should be approved. However, now that telephone users have risen up in opposition, I will accept your representatives' opinions and forward them to the General Manager for consideration. At the same time, I hope that your association can organize a joint association of users to negotiate with the company in a reasonable manner. The representatives then left. The association is now scheduled to hold the third special committee meeting against telephone rate increase at the association at 2:00 PM on August</p>
<p>2nd (Tuesday) to report on the negotiations with the Public Works Department and discuss future plans.</p>

<p>The municipal authorities have recently arranged a seaside bathing beach on the east beach of Gaogiao Town, Pudong. In addition to building houses for tourists to change clothes, rest, or dine, they have also planted cloth umbrellas all over the beach and set up cloth chairs for bathers to rest. Water rulers have also been erected in the water to ensure that bathers know the depth and location to avoid danger. It is heard that some people in the public are wondering if there will be a charge for swimming there. Someone went to inquire yesterday and was told that the purpose of setting up the bathing beach this time is to use the city's only natural beach, add some equipment, and provide it for citizens to enjoy. This is a necessary facility in the city, so in addition to charging fees for using the changing rooms to make up for the expenses, swimming is free of charge and there is no so-called admission ticket.</p>

<p>Two Thieves Robbed Over 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Thieves Fired Three Shots at Police, Fortunately Missing</p>
<p>The French newspaper at 23 Gongguan Road, French Concession, is the only French newspaper in this city. It has been established for many years and employs many workers. Yesterday happened to be the end of the solar month, which was the date for paying wages. Somehow, it was detected by thieves. At about 11:00 AM yesterday, two thieves, one wearing white silk shirt and trousers and the other wearing light blue shorts and speaking in local accents, suddenly came. One of the thieves wearing white silk held a pistol and broke in through the gate, invaded the second floor, went straight into the accounting room, raised the gun to scare and forbid screaming. They robbed more than 2,000 yuan of newly deposited wages in the iron box and carried it to escape. The gatekeeper, Constable Wang Chengji (from Anhui, 33 years old), heard the alarm and went out to chase, but was turned back by the thief, who fired three shots at the constable. Fortunately, the constable dodged quickly, so all three shots missed. The thieves then took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, the newspaper filed a report with the police station, requesting them to pursue the thieves.</p>

<p>The house of the late farmer Xu Baoquan in Yujiatang North House, south of Hongqiao Town in West Shanghai, was well-to-do and had recently been coveted by robbers. At about 11:00 PM the night before last (29th), eight or nine robbers who spoke in mixed accents suddenly broke into the house. The whole Xu family was awakened from their dreams. The robbers used ropes to tie the hands of the whole family behind their backs and threatened them with guns. Then, they turned boxes and cabinets upside down and searched arbitrarily, robbing clothes and ornaments worth about four or five hundred yuan. After about an hour, they all roared and went south. After robbing, the robbers went to the houses of two farmers, Qin Dianqing and Qin Fugeng, in Qinjiabiao, about three miles south of Yujiatang. It was heard that Qin's daughter would be married in September, so all the clothes and ornaments prepared for the wedding were robbed. The victims have now issued a list of losses and reported it to the police station in charge, requesting them to solve the case within a limited time to maintain peace in the area.</p>

<p>Sun Afeng, a woman from Ningbo, was 29 years old, petite and exquisite, with a dark complexion, living at 49 1/2 Oujia Road. She worked as a cigarette roller at the Huaping Tobacco Company on Huade Road. The company faced a Westerner's residence, which employed Yuan Yehai, a servant from Tianjin, who was 23 years old. When the woman got off work, he seduced her in every way and they became intimate with each other. On May 8th, he lured Sun to his house at 183 Tuoga Road and lived together as if they were husband and wife. Her father, Sun Songlai, searched everywhere for his daughter after she disappeared, but there was no news and he was troubled all day long. There was no trace to be found. The afternoon before yesterday, he was strolling idly on Tuogao Road when he saw his daughter Afeng playing on the road. Sun Songlai remained calm and secretly followed her. He saw the woman enter the house at 183, and then he knew that she had been lured and hidden there to live together. So he secretly reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The head of the police, Liu Zhongcheng, and a Western detective went to arrest Yuan Yehai and took the woman Sun Afeng to the police station together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the previous situation and requested an investigation. Then, Sun Songlai, the woman's father, reported the situation and said that he had gone to other places when his daughter disappeared, and he only found out about it when he returned. The court ordered Sun Afeng to stand in the witness box for questioning. The woman was dressed in modern fashion with a bobbed hairstyle, wearing a pink floral chiffon cheongsam, silk stockings, and satin shoes. She was not shy at all and said calmly that she was 18 years old, did not know her birthday, and was a female worker at the Huaping Cigarette Factory on Huade Road. The defendant was a servant in the Westerner's house opposite the factory. I fell in love with him. During the war in Shanghai, it had been five months. Before, I went home to tell my mother and tried to get her consent, but I was scolded by my mother, so I had to go out and rent a room with the defendant on Tuogao Road and was willing to marry him as his wife. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had fallen in love with Sun Afeng, and it was the woman's own will. Before, he asked her to go home and inform her mother to formally marry him, but he did not get what he wanted. He gave ambiguous answers and asked for judgment. Judge Fu Lin verified the confession and declared to both parties that although modern trends are not ancient, marriage matters should seek the consent of parents and should not be perfunctory, thinking that it is voluntary. Therefore, Yuan Yehai was sentenced to six months of imprisonment as a warning, and the woman Sun Afeng was taken back by her father Sun Songlai for discipline. When the woman heard the sentence, she did not want to go home and was willing to eat official lawsuits with the defendant. Judge Fu earnestly instructed the woman and also told her father not to abuse her. Afeng then bowed her head and followed her father home.</p>

<p>Actually Cohabiting with a Paramour</p>
<p>Su Kaisheng, a Yancheng native residing at 519 Youheng Road East, through the matchmaking of Li Bigu in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929], married Yin Di, the daughter of Xu Shanggui and Xu Sun, residing at 945 Yuanfang Lane, Old Huaihai Road East. Unexpectedly, after the marriage, Yin Di yearned for her mother's home and frequently returned to Ningbo. Su repeatedly tried to stop her, but Yin Di not only disregarded his warnings but also incited the anger of her parents, causing the relationship between father-in-law and son-in-law to deteriorate daily. On the eighth of this month, Yin Di again returned home without notice. By dusk the next day, she still had not returned, so Su went to visit her parents' home. Her parents claimed that she had not gone there, arousing great suspicion. He rushed home to check the luggage, only to find that all the clothes inside had been taken. He then discovered that Yin Di had an affair with Hu Guibao, residing at 120 Yuanchang Road, and used the excuse of returning to Ningbo to secretly meet with Hu. Her parents were fully aware of this but did not restrain her, and this had been going on for a long time. Su, understanding the whole situation, concluded that Xu Shanggui and others were colluding with each other. Besides reporting to the police and requesting an investigation, he also filed a criminal self-accusation against Xu and his wife, as well as Hu Guibao, with the First Special District Local Court, accusing them of adultery, absconding with property, and instigation. Judge Wu held a court hearing yesterday, summoned the parties for questioning, and announced that the trial would be rescheduled.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Jiutai Cigarette and Paper Store Case <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>One Fugitive, Three Arrested</p>
<p>The Jiutai Cigarette and Paper Store at 102 Hengxing East Lane, Waima Road outside the Sixteenth Bund in the South City, was robbed of approximately two thousand yuan worth of goods on June 29th of this year. Dong Mingde, the section leader of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a tip that the robbers Zhu Yaoting and Shen Guisheng were hiding at 77 Peide Lane, Xinzha Road in northern Shanghai. He immediately led detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, Peng Baolin, and others to the address the day before yesterday. Upon learning of their arrival, Shen Guisheng immediately escaped by climbing over the window onto the roof. When Dong and the others went upstairs, Shen was nowhere to be found. They arrested Shen's concubine, Zhang Li (nicknamed "Needle Girl"), and Zhu Yaoting's wife, Zhu Lin. They also found a pistol and thirty-one bullets in the toilet in the room and took them away. They also found a fake pistol in the garbage can in the lane. Just as they were about to take it back, Zhu Yaoting returned from outside. Seeing the detectives, he immediately fled, but Dong and the others caught him at the intersection of Shanhaiguan Road, took him back for preliminary interrogation. Zhu Yaoting confessed that he was twenty-eight years old, from Tongzhou, and had come to Shanghai with his wife, Zhu Lin, this spring. He had met his old friend Shen Guisheng and moved in with him at 77 Peide Lane. Shen used to work at the Longmao Fruit Store on the Sixteenth Bund but was now unemployed and financially strapped. On June 28th, he gathered Zhu, Gu Laoqi, A He, and the Monk, and the four of them met in front of the Hongzhang Yarn Factory west of Sanban Bridge in the North City. They agreed to rob the Jiutai Cigarette and Paper Store at around 6:00 AM the next morning. The stolen goods had already been divided and spent. Zhu Lin confessed that she was twenty-one years old, from Tongzhou, and Zhu Yaoting was her husband. When the detectives came to arrest them, Shen Guisheng told her to hide the pistol and thirty-one bullets in the toilet before escaping through the window. As for her husband's robbery of Jiutai, she knew nothing about it. Zhang Li confessed that she was twenty-two years old, from Tongzhou. Her former paramour was named Li Zhicheng, but after he was arrested for robbery, she had no choice but to become involved with Shen Guisheng, not expecting him to be a thief as well, leading to her implication. Gu A Xiang, who had fled with Zhu, confessed that he was twenty-five years old, from Wuxi, and worked as a tailor at 15 Sande Lane, Baker Road. The day before yesterday, he had gone to Peide Lane to visit a friend but had not found him, so he was waiting at the entrance of the lane when he suddenly saw detectives arresting robbers. Fearing danger, he had fled in a panic. The case was deemed important because it involved robbery, and they were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for further investigation.</p>

His wife rushed him to the Tongren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective. He died at 8:30 PM. The hospital moved the body to the coroner's office, awaiting notification of the court for examination.</p>

<p>The Lao Qingyun Silver Store, located on Changsheng Bridge in Xiaodongmen, Shanghai, has been in business for over 150 years. Its business is booming, and it is a giant in the silver store industry.

All kinds of gold and silver utensils on display, such as boudoir supplies, student stationery, and children's toys, are new and surprising, dazzling, and exquisitely crafted. The grand opening was held the day before yesterday, and people from all walks of life rushed to buy, which was very enthusiastic. Carriages and horses filled the street, blocking the road.

After returning to China, he worked at the Zhonghua Book Company and also practiced as a lawyer in the local area of Shanghai. Due to overwork, he developed lung disease.

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday said that the Shandong coast is clear with a strong southeasterly wind. The Yangtze River basin and the coast south of Ma'an Island are mostly cloudy with strong southeasterly winds and occasional showers. The southern East China Sea and the area around Taiwan have bad weather, with strong cyclones. This is because a cyclone on the Pacific Ocean is east of the Balingtang Strait, moving northwest or west-northwest. The center of the cyclone was about 120 miles within the intersection of 26 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude at about 6:00 AM, gradually weakening. One was about 60 miles within the intersection of 21 degrees north latitude and 126 degrees east longitude at about 2:00 PM, but the wind force is unknown.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have just read in your newspaper about the resignation of Zhu Qiqing, the head of the Shanghai Radio Station. Much of the content is untrue. Since I have been working in radio administration, I have always put the interests of the business first. The motive for this resignation was decided before March of this year, and it has nothing to do with the current change of director. Also, I am currently the engineer of the station, not the director. Please publish this letter in the letter column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Zhu Zhiqi Qing. July 30.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Restricting Public Servants from Criticizing Government Facilities <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>I most welcome people scolding [me]. If the scolding is correct, I can learn from it and improve. If the scolding is incorrect, it is like a rooster crowing or a dog barking. They lose their own character and can be ignored. That is my opinion.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the National Government has ordered all agencies that, in the future, if public servants believe that government facilities are inappropriate, they can submit written suggestions to their superiors and must not publish them to the outside world on their own. Those who violate this will be subject to disciplinary action by the competent superiors, depending on the circumstances. This is correct, because since they are public servants, if they believe that the government's measures are inappropriate, they can suggest them to the competent superiors, asking them to adopt them, or asking them to submit them to the authorities for consideration and adoption. It is not necessary to publish opinions to the outside world on one's own initiative. However, non-public servants, if they believe that the government's measures are inappropriate, do not seem to need to use the suggestion procedure and can freely publish them to the outside world. This sentence is implied, and it is self-evident. However, the government allows the people to freely express their opinions, which is originally the principle of the people's freedom of speech. Naturally, in freedom of speech, there are those who speak correctly and those who speak incorrectly. This is entirely up to the government's will. If the government believes that what is said is correct, it can adopt it as much as possible. If it believes that it is incorrect, it can be placed under the example of not discussing or discussing it. This is seeing the government's bright and upright attitude.</p>
<p>Preventing the people's mouths is worse than preventing rivers. As the ancient saying goes, it is even worse now. Moreover, from ancient times to the present, the government's means of preventing mouths can be said to have been exhausted. May I ask which dynasty or generation has had an effect? There is also another layer, preventing mouths is easy, preventing hearts is even more difficult. Although the mouth does not speak, the heart actually opposes. How can it be prevented? There is also another layer, if one openly and freely expresses opinions, they are a straightforward person. Although their words may be foolish, their hearts have no other intentions. For example, when encountering a dog, if it sees a person, it will bark loudly and firmly. That dog is definitely not fierce. What is most frightening is that there is no indication at first. Once you get close, it will jump out and bite wildly. This is really terrible.</p>
<p>It is said that only good people can accept exhaustive words. It is not easy to accept exhaustive words. Without a selfless attitude and a humble mind, when one hears unpleasant words, one cannot help but (anger rises from the heart and evil grows from the gallbladder). Therefore, the ancients said that only good people can accept exhaustive words.</p>

<p>Desperately chasing after the ancients, hoping not to be the same as the ancients, this is to be truly ancient, and its antiquity is endless, pitiful are the worldly scholars, strictly imprisoning their poverty, peeking at the ancients as if peeking through a pipe, one hole specializes in confusion, claiming to be able to imitate the ancients, is like a horse and cow wind, there are also new teenagers, who do not attack the books, and create themselves, turning to laugh at the ancients for not being successful, a lifetime of nonsense, the text and meaning cannot be understood, making people hear it and hate it, and want to make their ears deaf, these are all excesses, not knowing what to compromise, but the patriots are not like this, they shout loudly and stimulate the clear wind, salute the table of all ages, and be the hero of hundreds of generations, the big phoenix once lifted, how can they see the Artemisia wormwood again, I hope you will keep this words, and meet in the Qingming.</p>
<p>Ruan Ting likes to talk about the antelope, Zhao Zi loves to talk about the dragon, what he said seems to be Yu Qing, but it is actually a collection of hundreds of mistakes, the three hundred large and small elegant, what a lofty discussion, how ever the antelope hangs its horns, sending empty without a trace, I have never heard of Qu Songjing, writing books to teach fleas, I have never heard of Du Han, arranging the palace of Chen Shang, true accumulation of strength is long, high text is naturally harmonious, Li Du has repeated sentences, does not harm the hero of all ages, Kunlun has evil stones, does not harm the heaven and earth, placing artificial mountains in the pond, and starting to argue about the thick and light skills, I hope you will understand this principle, and naturally get what you learn from.</p>

<p>— Yin Zhen</p>
<p>(1) The installation of a lightning rod is very simple. A sharp metal pillar is installed on the roof, connected with thick copper wires, and a copper plate is buried in a damp place underground. This copper plate is connected to the thick copper wires. This installation is the installation of a lightning rod.</p>
<p>(2) The reason why lightning rods prevent lightning is that during thunderstorms, the induced electricity generated on the ground is slowly dissipated into the air by the sharp end, so the house is not subject to severe electrical shocks.</p>
<p>(3) The principle of lightning rod application The distribution of electricity is limited to the surface of conductors (metal-like objects that cause the easy movement of electrodes), and the curved places have more electricity than the flat places. Therefore, the sharper the column, the more electricity it carries. Because the sharp end has a large amount of electricity, the substances around the column are first attracted and finally repelled. (1) Therefore, all the electricity of the charged body is gradually lost, which is called the tip effect. The lightning rod is a kind of safety device made by applying the principle of the tip effect. (1) It is the property of electricity that the same sex repels each other and the opposite sex attracts each other.</p>
<p>(4) The effect of lightning rods After the lightning rod is installed on the house, whenever there is a thunderstorm, when the electric light and thunder are very intense, the nearby houses, people and animals will be struck by lightning. The family with the lightning rod installed can avoid this danger, so the lightning rod is also a part of the safety device. Now it is summer, and this kind of thing is just right, so I contribute it to you.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Suggestions for Improving the Kitchen in the Social Improvement Discussion <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>The kitchen of a family is the most important part, but Shanghai people don't pay much attention to it. The living room and bedroom are very particular, with luxurious and splendid furnishings, but the kitchen is only controlled by servants, and it is unbearably dirty. It is really a strange thing. If you go to the major mansions in Shanghai for investigation, you will definitely be shocked.</p>
<p>Originally, the masters, wives, young ladies, and grandmothers in the mansions would reach out for tea and open their mouths for food. They would not condescend to manage the affairs in the kitchen. They left it to the servants and let them be hygienic or unhygienic. They didn't know that the kitchen is where the food and drink come from, which is of great importance to health and disease. Especially in autumn and summer, it is common to see food not covered, flies flying on it, and leftovers cold and scorched, tilting east and flowing west, which is unbearably dirty. Isn't this the most unhygienic? The masters, wives, young ladies, and grandmothers only know that the rice is fragrant and the dishes are fresh, but they don't know that the food contains many germs.</p>
<p>In ordinary families, a kitchen is shared by four or five families. One rice basket east and one bamboo cabinet west, vegetables, fish, rice, and meat are scattered all over the floor, and the stench is pungent, which is disgusting. The most unhygienic thing is that the toilet is often outside the kitchen. Often, next to the tap water pipe, rice is washed and vegetables are washed. Thinking carefully, isn't it dirty, isn't it harmful? In restaurants on the sea, the toilet is often very close to the place where wine is heated, which is really nauseating. In the interior, the firewood room and the pit latrine are often adjacent to the kitchen, which is easy to catch fire and easy to spread germs. These things may seem like small things at first glance, but they are actually very important. Therefore, I put forward this suggestion for improving the kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Suggestions on Children's Toys <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Nong</p>
<p>The personality of our youth is developed in childhood, and the personality of children is closely related to their toys. Most ignorant men and women in our country use toys such as insects, fish, birds and beasts, and foreign dolls to feed their children. This kind of toy is a waste of money and has no benefit to the children's body and mind. Moreover, the source of this kind of toy is mostly from our country's arch-enemy, Japan!</p>
<p>I have seen Western children, except for very young girls, never play with toys such as foreign dolls. What they play with are small knives, axes, and small engines made in their own country. They use these toys to make various small toys themselves. This spirit is truly amazing.</p>
<p>Wooden knives, guns, swords, and halberds are purely national quintessence toys in our country. This kind of toy must be criticized by general modern people as barbaric. In fact, using this to feed children can best cultivate their martial spirit, which can just eliminate the sluggishness of our people.</p>
<p>As for the well-to-do families, they can buy Western-made toys, such as small air guns and small engines, to feed their children. This kind of toy can make children's minds more scientific, so that they will become scientific and useful youth in the future.</p>
<p>I have two young brothers, and the toys I have given them over the years are only a few wooden knives and two cheap small air guns. I used these toys to teach them the preliminary national art and shallow military knowledge. I dare not be confident that this is a good idea, but at least it is not as unprofitable as playing with all unconscious toys!</p>
<p>In short, the choice of toys greatly affects the future of children. Now I would like to make this suggestion, and I hope that all colleagues in this association will discuss it.</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Friend, have you been to the North Railway Station? Then have you paid attention to everything there? If not, I will tell you about a strange affair. Haha, it is truly a strange affair unique to our esteemed China. ··Oh? You don't believe it? Just wait and listen to me explain in detail.</p>
<p>Friend! The North Station was burned to ruins by the enemy, but apart from the railway police, there is still a large armed police force (maintaining order), just like before the war. They are both imposing and dignified!</p>
<p>It was still early, and an old man with tattered clothes carrying a load hurried up. Because the train was about to depart, he was naturally in a hurry; but he was stopped by the police's roar. Then, the tightly tied rope</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>was untied. Under the so-called (inspection) procedure, the old man's belongings were thrown one by one on the ground. They rummaged and rummaged, inspected and inspected again. Although the old man repeatedly begged for forgiveness because the train was about to depart, he waited until the train had left but the inspection was still not finished.</p>
<p>Then what happened afterwards? Haha, friend! That was truly interesting. Although these police officers didn't find any contraband, one of them took two bread rolls worth one hundred cash, smelled them near his nose, and then impolitely put them in his mouth and chewed. Ugh! Friend! What do you think this behavior is? It's simply highway robbery!</p>
<p>Of course, the robbed person could only stare blankly and remain speechless. However, friend! This is precisely the achievement of our esteemed country in maintaining law and order!</p>

<h3 id="e226">Such a Principal <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yuanbai</p>
<p>After the former principal of X School ascended to heaven, the foreigners spent three whole months with great difficulty inviting a Doctor to serve as the principal. At that time, the students were indeed a bit surprised. X School was a school established by the Church, and all school administration was managed by foreign priests. The principal was just a symbolic figurehead. For the Doctor to come and head the school, given his degree, it seemed a pity to make him a lackey-like principal of a middle school. However, perhaps he wouldn't be like the deceased scholar-principal. Perhaps he had the determination to run education and would earnestly reform the Church school. This was the speculation of us students before he took office.</p>
<p>When he took office, he met with the graduating class. At that time, we, the hundreds of students, eagerly inquired about his opinion on the problem of official registration, which we were looking forward to, and requested him to resolve it quickly. He said with affected seriousness, (Indeed,··· registration is a matter of formality,··· um, I also advocate immediate registration, but both Teacher X and Teacher X's wife insist on not registering, so we can only proceed slowly. If the Municipal Education Bureau seriously does its job and closes down unregistered schools, then the registration problem will not be difficult to solve.) Um, the purpose of his being the principal was not to improve the school, but to hope for the downfall of X School; not to enlighten the stubborn Western priests, but to obey them. This was the initial impression he gave us.</p>
<p>After he took office, X School saw a new figure: someone in a Western suit, carrying a briefcase, running around busily. In terms of school administration, apart from deliberately suspending a dean of studies and hiring a gentleman with the same surname from the principal's hometown to serve as dean of studies, he also dragged a group of fellow villagers to fill teaching positions. Whenever students made requests, he would always easily dismiss them with (The Western priests insist on this, and I have no way to do anything about it). Perhaps the Doctor thought he was being underutilized, so much so that he neglected the national salvation movement, or even the September 18th Incident. This Doctor, who specialized in obeying foreigners, caused a</p>
<p>shutdown farce because of his neglect of duty.</p>
<p>However, his good points should also be praised. He shouldn't be abruptly dismissed. He was particularly enthusiastic about religious affairs and was greatly praised by the Western priests. Therefore, after X School closed down, he honorably became a staff member of the Church bookstore. (But reward)</p>

<h3 id="e228">Death <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. T, has been unemployed for more than half a year. He only buys some sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks to fill his stomach every day. Sometimes, he doesn't even have the money to buy sesame flatbread and fried dough sticks, so he simply sleeps and doesn't eat. He thinks about it day after day, always hoping that when the situation is peaceful, he can immediately find a</p>
<p>position to make a living. But ah, reality tells him there is no hope. Recently, even Mr. A, who helped him survive, has lost his job!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, they wrote a letter saying that they had not had food for three or four days and wanted to ask Mr. B for help. But Mr. B himself had reached the end of his rope. After receiving the letter, he sighed deeply and sat there in silent thought.</p>
<p>In this year of terrible hunger, unfortunately, Mr. A fell ill. It is said that the illness is very serious and there is no hope. Naturally, being so poor that they can't even afford food, where can they afford to hire a doctor? They can only let him die.</p>
<p>That group of people who have not died but are tormented by poverty are constantly threatened by death. Recently, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and those who are not unemployed have reached the era of bankruptcy. In short, everyone is walking on the road to death. Who created this! (This is entirely the terrifying era created by the policy of non-resistance!) Mr. T said angrily in a letter one day, (If we were asked to go to the front line to fight, then we would have no regrets even if we died, but to starve us to death alive, we will not rest in peace even in death!)</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Now the customs duties have been looted, the post office has been looted, Rehe is in danger, and Tianjin and Beiping are shaking. Everything is in a mess. The country has already reached the point of bankruptcy, let alone the common people. If things continue like this, the various countries don't need to send a single soldier, and they don't need any dum-dum bullets, smoke bombs, battleships, or airplanes. They only need to send a few well-dressed civil officials to jointly manage China's finances, and China will be finished. Japan's dispatch of troops seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>However, in this year of peril and ruin, the majority of the people still live their lives with equanimity. Young people still go to movie theaters, dance halls, and engage in romance. The ignorant masses, although they are walking on the road to death, only sigh a few times about their own misfortune. Chinese people treat other Chinese people, and if they disagree, they will treat each other with their fists. But when they are slapped by a foreigner, not only do they not retaliate, but they also respectfully offer a smile.</p>
<p>Alas! This era is full of signs of walking on the road to national demise. Road to death!</p>

<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Every time Auntie Si returned to the countryside from Shanghai, she wore a new-style cheongsam, her hair was neatly and smoothly cut, her exquisite watch, and her sparkling gold earrings were especially worthy of people's attention!</p>
<p>Everyone envied her for having such happiness and beauty as a maid in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Jinbao was the most enthusiastic admirer, and she often dreamed of her ideal dream at night.</p>
<p>She asked her parents many times, (I want to go to Shanghai with Auntie Si to work as a maid.) But her parents always refused and advised her, (You are so young, what do you know? Shanghai is a den of all kinds of evil, it's better not to go!) But vanity gnawed in people's hearts, and the power of magic was so great that she came up with a plan.</p>
<p>(Auntie Si! I want to go to Shanghai with you to work as a maid, but my parents won't allow it. Please recommend me to my parents!) Jinbao said to her when Auntie Si was in the countryside.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jinbao's parents heard that Auntie Si was recommending their daughter and would do her best to take care of her. Money is loved by everyone, so Jinbao's parents agreed to Jinbao going to Shanghai with Auntie Si to work as a maid!</p>
<p>Jinbao has been working as a maid in a brothel in Shanghai for three years. Her parents, because her wedding date was approaching, had repeatedly asked Auntie Si to urge her to go back. But she had already found a lover in the environment of desire, so she repeatedly made excuses and refused to go back. How would her parents know that!</p>
<p>Because her wedding date was imminent, her father had no choice but to go to Shanghai to find her. He saw that she was no longer the her from the countryside three years ago. She was wearing a fashionable cheongsam, and her braids were gone. Her high-heeled leather shoes were polished so brightly that they reflected people, and she had become a modern woman. Of course, in the process of women's transformation, one can see their integrity. Jinbao was also one of the transformed. How shocked her father was! He forced her to return quickly.</p>
<p>A week after Jinbao's wedding, she disappeared.</p>
<p>(Jinbao's mother! Didn't Auntie Si go to find Jinbao yesterday? This must be Auntie Si's trick. Several similar things in the village must have been done by her. She specializes in luring women from the countryside to satisfy her desire for wealth. Alas! Detestable Auntie Si! You shouldn't have deceived my beloved Jinbao····) Jinbao's father said with tears····</p>

<p>— Lin Xia</p>
<p>Yongxin is a very smart and literary young man. He is only seventeen years old and has already graduated from high school. This time he came to Shanghai with me to take the university entrance exam. In his spare time, he only studies and reads newspapers at home. In less than half a month, he has already remembered many novel phrases from the new literature.</p>
<p>Recently, he respectfully sent a letter to his grandfather:</p>
<p>(Respectfully reporting to Grandfather's knees: The universities in Shanghai are really a mess. The day before yesterday, Mr. Zhang told me (the male and female students of Shanghai K University only know how to pursue modernization every day. They don't attend classes. Either they find a mister to have a good time, or they borrow a pass from Miss Wang's black bench to go to the French Park for fun, or they gather a group of comrades to go swimming at the beach, and have picnics in the wild, playing happily. They only open their books when they have to, and they complain bitterly after reading half a page. When it comes to major exams, fortunately they have many friends and can obtain passes. They still answer the questions fully, and the teachers are lenient and give everyone a pass. ) A university like this is really misleading young people. Your grandson will definitely not take its exam,···)</p>
<p>His grandfather was so angry when he received this letter that his beard stood on end. He read it dozens of times, wondering if his grandson was talking nonsense or spouting nonsense. He picked up a pen and wrote a strongly reprimanding handwritten instruction····</p>
<p>(···Reading your report, it is full of glib talk and I don't know what it means. Have you caught the epidemic and are talking nonsense? Does modernization produce dogs or rats? The black bench is a seating tool. What is there to borrow? And what kind of monster is a pass? What is even stranger is that the same word "pass" is used three times, but the meanings cannot be combined. The meaning of "place and occasion" in your report seems to be (time) (moment). Why not use the original word directly and replace it with "place and occasion"? You are young, so I will forgive you once. If you continue to make such a fuss and fill the page with nonsense, I will definitely not forgive you···)</p>
<p>Yongxin realized after receiving his grandfather's stern letter that his grandfather had not studied English or Japanese. No wonder he regarded these phrases as complete nonsense. He found it funny instead.</p>
<p>I think this kind of joke is probably not just happening to my fellow villager!</p>
<p>Why</p>

<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>He has been in Shanghai from the countryside for only five years in total, I believe. This is something I witnessed with my own eyes. In the beginning, there was a kind of rustic demeanor that can still be reflected in my mind.</p>
<p>He was an ordinary staff member in XX store. His salary was naturally limited. He liked to eat some snacks, and each month, after deducting all expenses, he had a little surplus to save. In the winter of the second year, his family made the decision for him to marry a village girl as his wife. At that time, I also sent a small gift. As for him? He naturally returned to his hometown with joy to be a bridegroom!</p>
<p>When he came back after his marriage, I and several of his colleagues swarmed around him, wanting him to announce the process of his marriage and report to the public. Although he didn't say a word, the expression on his face of raised eyebrows and constant smiles was enough to represent the joy in his heart! The sweetness of love!</p>
<p>One year 丨 two years 丨 three years, time flies forward non-stop. Strangely enough! All of his actions were also rapidly changing and progressing. From the top of his head to the heels of his feet, he dressed up beautifully! Not only did he not dare to be considered a country person anymore, but everyone was probably calling him a big spender! At the same time, when he saw these modern girls in Shanghai, how could he not feel lively in his heart! Occasionally, when he thought of the yellow-faced village wife at home, he couldn't help but feel puzzled, annoyed, and resentful. As a result, he had long harbored the thought in the depths of his heart! Village girl! You cannot grow old with me!</p>
<p>The poor woman: she couldn't even dream that she had been abandoned by her husband! Every day she still carries out her housework step by step. But as the days went by, she never received a letter from her husband, and no money was sent home. She was suspicious, anxious, and finally resolutely decided to come to Shanghai and stayed in XX Hotel, calling the tea server to ask her husband to come to XX store.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to rush to XX Hotel to meet her. The moment he saw her, he cursed, (What are you doing here? Are you here to die!) She naturally (shed tears before speaking), and later, I don't know how he incited his anger and was viciously beaten by him, running away angrily and no one knew where!</p>
<p>Alas! Prosperous Shanghai, filthy Shanghai! I don't know to what extent you will lure people! And how much evil will you create!</p>
