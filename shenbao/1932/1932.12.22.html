<p>時評</p>
<h3>集中國力挽救危亡</h3>
<p>三中全會開。中委孫科等二十七委員臚列原則與辦法。提集中國力挽救危亡一案。是案業經大會通過。據報紙所載。其原則大致一爲關於内政之整飭。另一爲關於憲政之準備。在整飭内政之原則下。如切實保障人民集會結社言論出版居住信仰之自由。如政治分會之存廢。如整飭行政系統。如派員考察各地方政治及民間疾苦。都有極明確之决定。而在準備憲政之原則下。於進行地方自治。籌開國民大會。起草憲法諸項。亦都有極具體之昭示。國難至此。危急存亡。僅存一綫。集我全力。共謀打破當前之艱局。是蓋爲一年以來我全國人民所朝夕呼顴而不可得者。今在負有領導全國政治重責之三全大會中。旣已决議且又明白規定實施之原則。此種確定明白之昭示。誠爲全國人民所共仰。雖然。吾人猶有未能已於言者。容申論之。　　人民集會結社言論出版居住信仰之絶對自由一點。在國民黨黨綱中。在去年國民會議通過之約法中。以及在政府其他宣言法令中。蓋無一不有極明白之規定。顧法典煌煌。載者若彼而氓之蚩蚩受者仍若此迄至今日人民不僅仍無集會結社言論信仰等之自由。即個人之生命。且亦常隨要人之喜怒憎好而生之死之。無絲毫之保障。政出多門。法典繁多。在此　爲功首。而在彼處則爲元惡。爲功爲罪。一無定則。此種現象。自决不容再任其延長。故吾人於此次大會之决議。固極表懽欣。但吾人尤深盼此决議之能切實執行。不再徒爲歷史上之文獻。蓋决而不行。實與不决無異。且又無以昭政府之大信。此其一也。</p>
<p>次之。政治分會之設立。本即爲變相之割據。在「健全中央鞏固中央」之原則下。此種制度之應澈底打破。亦自毫無可疑。顧分裂割據局面之形成。必另有其根因。而不僅在於政治分會之形式。政治分會之形式。即可打破。而割據之實質。初不必亦遂之而消滅。故今日必須審其根因所在。從而發動掊掘根因之「實力。」庶「議」旣能「决。」「决」即可「行。」此其又一也。</p>
<p>復次。派員考察政治。以及訪詢民間疾苦。立意固善。但究尚爲末端。蓋今日外侮日急。内亂紛起。野盈餓莩。道載流亡。是即政治得失之反影。亦即人民疾苦之寫真。今政府旣具改革政治解除人民疾苦之决心。則眼前瘡痍滿目。危機環生。應即以人民之利益爲前提。政府當局能以此旨訓令各級官吏。各級官吏能遵令實行。政治自可步入正軌。猶恐其不能實力奉行也。然後派員考察以騐其成績如何而獎懲之。如此則考察更有實際。此其三也。</p>
<p>更有言者。憲政之實施。固亦早爲全國人民一致之要求。但吾人尤切盼憲法之制定。爲依據於真正之民意。夫然後憲政之實施。乃能真爲民權之行使。脫其不能。則民元制憲之覆轍。即鑒在前車。差之毫厘。失之即在千里。此其四也。</p>
<p>總之。吾人於大會集中國力以救危亡之一决議案。在原則上無不竭誠贊同。但「力」如何而後可「集。」所「集」者爲何種之「力。」以及必需何種之「力」而後可以「救亡。」則尤切盼大會作進一步之研討。抑又聞之。爲政不在多言。「行」而已。但須使所言者表現以事實。則政治自能發生偉力。自能愽得人民之擁護。若意大利若蘇聯。皆跟前之實例。此吾人所又敢以摰誠切盼大會一審愼之思者也。</p>

<h3>東北問題與國聯</h3>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>中國一般與論雖希望若干政治性質之特權、歸還中國、以符中國國權之尊嚴、然任何富有理解性之華人、除運用世界公認之談判及恊定方法以達到其目的外、决不主張其他方法、有時吾人或可在街頭牆角見得一二標語、或在學校講壇上聽得一二演説、對中外國交之現行根據有所指摘、然此種標語演辭、決不能代表全國之謹愼態度、適如西方各國之共產報紙、不足代表各該國之一般意見同也、中國國民黨孫先總理所倡導之民族主義、爲三民主義之一、其性質全爲自衛的·和平的·建設的、此項民族主義、實爲中國與世界各匣交接後所得經騐之結果、爲一種民族的期望之表現、欲求中國從不平等條約中求解脫、以求與世界其他各國平等之地位、是以其性質純爲自衛的·和平的、同時、該民族主義、又爲建設的、何以故、蓋其最後目的、實爲經民族主義之途徑、以達到世界大同也、中國願望逐步進展、成爲一堅强繁榮之大、國俾在全世界和平幸福上、可以有所供獻、深知世界各國、其前進之最後一步、終將成爲一種「國族、」共入於大同之境、此種政治上之最高見解、中國古聖賢之言論中、已每每有之、孔子即其一也、孫先總理更從而發揚光大其意、乃成爲國民黨主義上政策上之主要點焉、雖然、中國人民對於日本之控制克服中國之傳統政策、則上下一致反對之、中日邦誼、每經一次衝突、日本之傳統政策、亦愈　鮮明、而其足以危害中國之安全生存、亦愈益無疑、中國人民之視目下東三省事件、並不視爲局部事件、而視爲日本全部大陸政策之一端、善哉報告書二十三頁中之言去、</p>
<p>一近數年中、日本之要求在中國方面已認爲對於中國國家願望之一種嚴重挑釁、較之列强所主張之一切權利、尤有甚焉、」</p>
<p>中國人民之作此觀念、並非出於疑懼、實乃出於過去數十年之經騐習知所得也、至對於其他各國、則中國絶無排外之意、上至政府、下至人民、皆誠心願望中外各國間邦誼之敦睦、以爲互相利益、關於此點、殊無需余之多言、今僅舉數字爲證、現在各國僑民之在中國平安工作生活者、共有三十六萬人、外商行號共有八千二百家、僑民中有七五六七人爲敎土、在中國内地各處傳道、並無困難艱險、間有肇事、亦屬例外即在中國本部之許多日僑、雖當此日中情感緊張之秋在中國政府保護之下、亦仍能安居樂業、絶少不测事件之發生也更有一事可證明者、中國許多國營事業中、雇用外籍人員甚多、中央政府各部會中、即有八國專家四十餘人、襄助一切行政、此後人數且更有增加之勢、報告書中對於此點、亦曾提及、其言曰、</p>
<p>「國民政府近來對於解决中國各種問題均　求及接受國際之援助、如自一九三○年以來之財政事宜、自一九三一年全國經濟委員會成立以來、聯絡國聯專門機關、以辦理經濟之設計發展事宜、又於同年辦理水災救濟事宜等等皆是」、</p>
<p>最近國民政府曾請國聯爲介、聘請專家多人、來華研究敎育·衛生·濬河·農業及絲業等等間題、中國對外若果有仇意、則此種合作計畫、當未能獲得若是之成功也、日方所提出對於中國之指摘、其目的顯然爲求淆惑聽聞、藏飾真問題、其所有比較重要各點、余已爲指出其不當矣、遠東和平之真正威脅、實爲日本之大陸政策、亦已如上述矣、然則關於本案最關重要之各項事實、其已居報告書中闡明者、果爲何乎、試爲諸君一道之、日本對於其九一八事變及其後種種行爲之解釋、曾提出許多誇大異常的要求、中國政府對於調查圑報告中各節、揭微發隠、甚感興味、日本曾聲稱中日懸案、多至三百餘件、日本之所以取武力行動、實爲求此等懸案之圓滿解决、然調查圑報告書六十六頁中言、</p>
<p>「惟所謂兩國間有三百件未决之案、又爲解决各該案件、和平方法已由一方逐漸用盡等語、則均未能證實」、</p>
<p>報告書又稱、「於是必要時應以武力解决一切懸案之語、遂爲一通行之口號」、又稱、「凡武力解决之决議、陸軍省參謀本部等討論武力計畫之會議、以及關於必要時、如何實行此項計畫、所發致關東司令官及駐在奉天九月初被召至東京且主張從速以武力解决一切懸案之士肥原大佐之確定的訓令、均在各報中隋意引載、閱各報關於此種種方面及其他圑體之情感之記載、即可知情勢日趨於危險的緊張、一報告書六十六頁、又指出日本陸相在東京之激烈演説、主張日本在滿洲之軍隊、採取直接行動、並指出在瀋陽日軍夜操之挑釁行爲及其不時的開火、最後乃述及九一八事件、該項事件、就報告書中所稱、乃爲「武力占領滿洲之初步」、觀於此、可見目下中日爭端之導線、並非一國對另一國之懸案之未解决·而實爲日本軍事當局之干涉行爲、又關於中日懸案、調查圑在報告書中固已表示其性質可用公斷或法律的方法解决者矣、然則日本在一九三一年九月十八·十九·之武力行爲、是否果如日本所稱純爲自衛行爲乎、此問題之答案、乃不特對中國且對國聯含有最大之重要性、蓋此點與國聯盟約之規定大有關係也、日本聲言日軍犯滿、實爲自衛行動、然調查圑對日方此説、並不同意、其言曰、</p>
<p>中日雙方軍隊間情緒之激昂、實無容諱、本調查圑會得一種證明、日方於事前確有充分計盡、以應付中日間萬一發生之戰事、此計盡於九月十八日至十九日之夜見諸實行、迅速證確、中國方面遵守上峯之訓令、（見六九頁）旣無進攻日軍之準備、在彼時或在該地亦無危害日人生命財產这計畫、對付日軍、並非集中應戰、亦未奉命開火、故對於日軍之突擊及其以後之行動、莫不認爲詫異」、</p>

<p>律師之辯護　　、被告辯護人張律師稱、招商局自從政府派專員監督後、其主體已屬於政府、股東權早被剝奪、所以監督總經理悉爲政府所派、是依政府的意思爲意思、監督卽政府之代表、故與爲他人處理事務條例不合、至意圖爲不法之損害者、請醒已訂合同及未訂合同上研究卽可明白、以前所欠利息在一分以上、現僅九釐、關於三棧、以前爲發展海外所置、現均破爛不堪故其棧單、銀行拒絶、人家裹足不來堆存如今假人之力而建新屋、則各銀行不效、就可賺錢、而一千萬兩如何還、就拿他的三十萬租洋還並且組織碼頭公司·局方有一半利益、幾年功夫、卽可運清、這種爲大利、也卽政府收回國有、每股五十兩、共四萬殷、則二百餘萬連之各項、不到二千萬、乃抵押二千萬、何謂損失、至航權以二十隻破船、換三十隻新船、不必付錢、籍大來聯運以展事務、大來不過管賬而已、航權何失此係生產之道、而七十萬請賂、據各方證明你有信説明墊欵及付收　、下午三時、於個人廣座中、何能行　　、先後保證金、亦爲常事等語、又由沙律師零稱、現在所見到的李國杰、對於招商局只有利益而無損害、　檢察官亦説非專家評斷、不能　其果有損害、則爲何不於債查時檢定後而起訴、故卽可認爲不能作主之處、卽不可卽　定罪刑、而陳孚木拿去的錢、依照刑法三十五條上級官要提去保管、當然無罪、究竟保管與否在於何處、與李國杰不相干渋　、李國杰本來是大股東、愛國心重、乃爲起死回生之計盡、以興招商局意思爲完全衛護國家利益、至該七十萬爲陳孚木　去、依大理院解釋、李國杰亦爲被害人地位、如果賄賂何出印收、並且註明爲墊欵完全證明爲借欵一部分、請宣告無罪、又江律師起構、本案因關於三千萬之大借欵、及七十萬元之陳孚木取去、以致外面遵駭人聽聞、但犯罪要以犯嫌而定罪、不能憶測、不能以陳孚木之事而牽到李國杰之身、要請求注意、並加以比較、招商局事實上已欠一千七百萬、若再不理、債權人强制執行拍賣、故而髣收外資、以開發業務、卽財政部亦有因辦實業而借外債、若謂借外債而定罪、則先將歷届財政部長各個辦罪、這種以人家錢而來求利、苟比較到將來爲法院查封拍賣、何者爲有利、監督係政府任命者、總經理因事事奉命、相信政府、相信官員命令、而致犯罪、故李國杰並不負責任、又李國杰在檢察處已奉交保後爲行政干係監視於醫院、致病體不愈、但李國杰生於上海、住於上海、財產悉在招商局、且如有逃亡之虞、不自到宋院長公館故可以担保下次由律師代表、不必再事監視於醫院、法律有時亦可糾正行政的、</p>

<h3>職業與社會</h3>
<p>㈠關於翁君所提問題之討論</p>
<p>丨原函見本月十九日本　丨</p>
<p>朱嬰君訉：記者先生答復翁君的信，説：「假使校長做不成，一家老小都可以做工去，只要吃得苦，總不會餓死！如足下以　做工是丢臉的事，那是你自己思想在隋落，我們是沒有辦法的了。」話是很對的，不過在現在整個社會經濟不量氣之下，單就上海而論，原來的工人失業下來的不知有若干？以翁君一個文弱的書生，而他的一家老小從來沒做過工的，究竟做什麽工？那個工廠肯要他們？我看見很多的人，都是大學畢業，或者在從訂做過什麽官來的，他們很願意和他們的妻子做工，並且把長衫西裝脫下，已經穿上了工人的衣裳了，然不是各廠不添人，就是添人不要生手。至於説？「只要吃得苦，總不會餓死。」我又要問；「陜西甘肅···的一些老百姓，那一個不是比我們更十二分吃得苦，然何以餓死的那様多？我再説一句：就是某大學畢業生想到貴報做一名極下役的工人，有殷實的舗保，貴報是否能容納？以上各問題，請答復。</p>
<p>覆：來函提問各點，我們認爲很有意开</p>
<p>義。不過，我們於上次覆翁君函中，曾經這様説過：「此實爲整個社便問題，决難個别救濟。所以足下來信，要我們做一個完滿的答復，辦法未　沒有，不過説來話長，而結果還是不能救足下一時之急的」。所以，我們未嘗不知道這是「整個社會」問昰題，未嘗不知在現社會中找尋工作之困難，未嘗不知陜西甘肅等處老百姓，　是「吃苦」，結果還是「餓死」，我們回答翁君的那些話，是希望翁君在整個社會問題未得解决之前，就自己的能力，謀一個脚痛醫脚頭痛治頭的辦法，自然這辦法，我們剑能認爲滿意，但我們也不能呌人坐着等，非整個社會問題解决以後，再解决切身問題。足下如若一定要我們定一個根本解决辦法，我們可以回答足下的是目前不是已經有許多學者，天天在研究怎様改革社會制度嗎？至於足下問：如有「某大學畢業生想到本報做一名極下　的工人，有殷實舗保，本報是否能容納？」我也亦要先問足下，現社會中像某大學生的失業者，是否僅僅某开</p>
<p>大學生一人？如僅僅一人，我們可以毫不猶豫的答應「容納」，如不止一人，有幾十萬人甚至幾知萬人，則我們的答覆毫無疑義的是「不能」，因爲以乘輿濟衆，雖説是一件快事，但其如「衆」不勝「濟」何？</p>
<p>㈡關於包志正君所提問題之討論</p>
<p>丨　原函見本月十七日本欄丨</p>
<p>傅克白君訊：㈠因爲這中整個政治的黑暗，我們只有聯合大家，齊心不付「黑費」。如公安局，進一步的　起什麽　辦法，施以壓迫，那大家就得更須認清，非得打倒這種黑暗的組織，我們不能安穏！自然，須根本的辦法，是必得轉變這社會制度不爲功，㈡此種職業，根本就是辦法，然而處現時中國農村經濟破產的目前，欲得新的出路，只有包君以自覺覺人的精神，向同業九十家乃至廣大被壓迫者作普遍的宣傳，把這慘苦的生活，轉變到有生氣的革命的途上去，。</p>
<p>㈢關於伍思敬君所提問題之討論</p>
<p>丨原函見本月十七日本欄丨</p>
<p>㈠姜存松君訊：少數人不必靠他的學問能力就可以有飯吃的原因，在任用者方面，㈠喜人奉承，㈡愛講面子，㈢顧到私情，㈣無遠大眼光，㈤缺管鑑别力，在被任用者方面，㈠善吹拍，㈡善機變，㈢攀援權貴，㈣無氣節。多數誠實坦白有相當謀生技能的反而有飯吃的原因，就是不具備以上各項原因，更有一般的原因，就是僧多粥少，肯創業的人少，而想吃現成飯的人多。</p>
<p>㈡傅克白君訊：因爲社會是把握在這少數人的手裏，所以多數人儘管有謀生的技能而得不到飯吃，伍君乃至一般失業者，的確是有權要求社會給以工作，然而你不去改造這社會，有誰會來理你的要求呢！朋友，社會是死的，總得人力的推動繞行啊！</p>

<p>杭州之江大學籃球隊、昨與滬江大學隊作友誼賽於楊樹浦、一則稱雄西湖、一則蜚聲海上、逐鹿結果、滬江賴其聯絡之美、投籃之準、在在佔得優先、之江則以場地生疏、結果乃以三十四比六十一敗於滬江、觀其球藝、雖不及滬江、但動作清爽、戰力强勁、聯絡方面、亦有可觀、不弱於滬上其他球隊、今晚七時、之江赴徐家匯交通大學比賽、交大籃球、近來頗有進步、此戰未知鹿死誰手也、昨戰情形如下、</p>
<p>▲滬江一路順風裁判員陸鍾恩鳴笛開賽、之江先聲奪人、勢如破竹、滬江錢敬鏞打開紀錄後、之江王譜笙張國威連得六分、以六比二佔優、但從此以後、滬江左右逄源、分數迭增、加以短傳遞之美妙、愽得全場彩聲、霎時間、滬江以十八比六勝、之江努力奮門、由金述賢加上二分、滬江鏡敬鏞馮念華全塲奔馳、難於捉摸、一再得分、青雲直上、以三十七比十五勝上半時、</p>
<p>▲之江急起直追休息再戰、滬江力戰不懈、得分累累、之江努力反攻亦不示弱、自五十六比十七時、滬江錢馮兩鋒及後衛孫實慶離塲、由施家駒鄒啟宇袁　武補人、戰力稍减之江全軍奮發、急起直追王譜笙張國威、屢有建樹、陳堯聖犯國雄在後接應、陣容鞏固、　懈可擊、滬江至此、祇有招架之力而無進攻之能、逐鹿結果、滬江得六十一分、之江三十四分、成績如下、</p>

<h3>蓮花落（三）</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>他又哭，哭了一回兒道：「呌我怎麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我們一塊兒走吧！」</p>
<p>我們就一同往南走，也不知跑那兒走，路上她不說話，我也不敢説話。走到一家鎭上，她説：「我真餓了。」我就跑到一家大餅舗子那兒，跟那個掌櫃的求着道；「先生，可憐見我，餓壤了。　　家給大兵打了，跑一天一晚，沒東西吃。」那掌櫃的就像沒聽見。我只得走了開來，她站在那兒拐灣角兒上，用埋怨的臉色等着我。我沒法兒，走到一家綢緞舗子前面，不知怎麽的想起了蓮花落，便低了腦袋：　　『曖呀曖子喂！　　花開梅花落呀，一開一朶梅花·臘梅花！』</p>
<p>我覺得臉在紅起來，旁邊有許多人在圍着看我；我真想鑽到地下去。這時候兒我猛的聽見還有一個人在跟着我唱，一瞧，却是她，不知那兒弄來的兩塊破竹片，拿在手裏，的的得得地拍着。我氣壯了起來·馬上挺起了胸子，抬起腦袋來，高聲兒的唱着蓮花落丨我們是兩個人在唱着。</p>
<p>就從那天起，飄泊着，秋葉似地，從這座城到那座城。後來我們又弄到了一把破胡琴，便和一把胡琴，一副檀板，一同地，一重山又一重山，一道水又一道水，在草屋子的柴門前面，在黑漆的大門前面，我們唱着蓮花落。</p>
<p>昨天晚上，我們坐在一條小胡同裏。她有點寒熱，偎在我身旁，看了我的頭髮道：「你的頭髮也有點兒灰了。」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎，四十多了，那能呌頭髮不白。」</p>
<p>「我們從凉亭裏跑出來，到現在有二十多年，快三十年咧。光陰過得真快呀！你還記得嗎，有一年我們在河南，三天沒討到東西吃，你那當兒火氣大極了，不知怎麽來就打了我，把我腰那兒打得一大塊靑丨你還記得嗎？」</p>
<p>「你不是還把我的臉抓破了嗎？」</p>
<p>「在凉亭裏那晚上不也很像今兒嗎？」</p>
<p>我抬起腦袋來：在屋詹那兒，是一隻灣月亮，把黑瓦全照成銀色的。</p>
<p>「可是我真倦了！」她把腦袋靠在我肩上，好重。</p>
<p>我也沒理會。只管看月亮。可是她就那麽地死去咧。</p>
<p>和一副檀板，一把胡琴，一同地，一道水又一道水·一重山又一重山，在草屋子的柴　前面，在黑漆大門前面，在街上，在麥塲裏，我們同地唱着蓮花落。我們在一塊兒笑一塊兒哭，一塊兒嘆息，一塊兒抹眼淚：世界上有個我，還有個她！我們是兩個人。</p>
<p>是的，我們是兩個人，可是她在昨天晚上死了，（完）</p>
<h3>關於小說的評選</h3>
<p>— 謝六逸</p>
<p>（上半年替上海的某書局選了一部）「模範小説，」在各篇的後面，都有分析的介紹。本篇打算用作原書的叙文。現在提前發表於此，就正「大雅一。」</p>
<p>從前金聖嘆評水滸，評到潘金蓮喊武松做「叔叔」「叔叔」的地方，聖嘆從她喊出第　個叔叔就跟着數起，一直數到三十多個，最後的評語是「寫淫婦便是活淫婦，以上已經呌過三十九遍叔叔，至此忽然換上一個「你」字，妙心妙筆。「這種鑑賞的批評，在批評文學沒有什麽成績的中國，即在今日，也自有相當的價值。雖然現在已經有了「意識模糊」感者「······能把握現實」一類的批判。可是過於攏統的批評，我是······我是什麽呢，我是「不敢說它不好。」　　國内有一位著作家，在某雜誌上曾經肯定地説我國的靑年沒有再做古文的了。自然，這是我們求之不得的。如像「天地乃宇宙之乾坤，吾心實中懹之在抱，久矣夫百年來已非一日矣·····」或是「臣聞求木之長者，必先·····」一類的文　，我們站在進化論的原則上，當然不相信現在的靑年還肯提起筆來寫這様的文章。時代不是在前進嗎？然而事實上已經證明，舊八股他們不會寫，新八股却頗擅長。例如形容「衆多」一義，有一部分人無論在什麽地方，什麽時候，什麽文章裏面，總省不得用一句「如雨後春筍」：他們要槪括事物，老是用一句「一切的一切」；要説明印象的深厚，無論在什麽文章裏，也少不得「······永遠刻在心版上」這一句。我這様揭發出來，大有「咬文嚼字」的嫌疑。在號稱革命的人看來，文字原是末流，最要緊的是「意識正確」，且須得「擁護自身階級的利益。」不過愚意以爲新八股寫得太多了，也許防害「意識的正確」，甚或不免減少「擁護自身階級利益」的力量。我們的希望很簡單，不但要大家的「意識正確」；「能擁護自身階級的利益」，更盼望大家少寫幾句新八股文。不要一味模倣他人，須能自鑑新辭才好。</p>
<p>鑑賞他人的作品，是人人都會的，只要認識字。原用不着把别人的作品拿來分析。反正看了一遍之後，如果原作好，就稱讚它一句「描寫精細」：原作不佳，只消駡一聲「寫得一搨糊塗」就行了。天下事以不了了之，實爲一種高明的辦法。即使要拿一篇作品來分析説明它的優劣，也是各人有各自的看法，實難勉强别人和自己一様，斷斷不乎能整齊劃一的。我不想做什麽「指路碑，」最高的目的，不過是將個人欣賞作品的絲毫所得，寫點出來供給喜歡看小説的靑年：在「文字」「意識」「描寫」各方面，助他們一臂之力而已。</p>
<p>翻開坊間出版的中國作家辭典一看，我國的作家快要凑足五百　漢之數了。但我在這本書裏只選了五個作家的作品。我早已硬起頭皮，準備别的作家來打我駡我。而且駡我的第一句話，我也早已猜着了。這句駡我的話不是别的，就是「你是近視眼呵！」其實我的眼睛何嘗近視，我也嘗用過千里鏡在這沙漠地带，向各方眺望了一下。國内的作家無論如何不只五個，這是千眞萬確的事實。不過我所做的是「匠人」的工作，匠人選擇材料時，必要顧到能不能上得自己的「　線」。我選擇的結果，這五個作家的作品，可以上得我的墨線，所以我要唐突他們的作品一下了。至於其他作家的其他傑作，留待别的匠人去使用罷。（十二月十七日）</p>
<h3>瑞士的少女</h3>
<p>— 劉風</p>
<p>瑞士的風景，雖是沒有親自遊歷過的人，想着或聽着，也就不禁神往；但瑞士除去亞爾甫山的白雪，盧夢湖的綠波之外，難道就沒有别的繫人心處嗎？啊，不。這平和清靜的國家，在她那隨處皆是的，明媚的山光水色之外，還有着最使旅人顛倒的，强壯秀美而又富於風情的女人。</p>
<p>瑞士的女子，在結婚之前，是很浪漫的，中國人所謂「風流艷事」，在瑞士幾乎人皆有之。本月五日本刋曾登載過萬居君的一篇「瑞士的少女」，茲就鄙人見聞所及，補退兩則如下。</p>
<p>瑞士某地有一個農人老是歎惜他那菓園中的菓子被人偷去；有一天，一個外國旅客聽見他這様歎惜，便問他道：「你爲什么不養一隻狗呢？」那誠實的農人答說：「那麽，我的幾個女兒就永遠嫁不着人了。」那個外國人聽見他這様説，有點莫明其妙，追問他這話是什麽意思。他答説：「我曾養過一隻狗，非常兇惡，不論看見什麽人到我家裹來就唁唁狂吠，結果弄到一班靑年都不敢再來扒我們家裏的窗户了。」</p>
<p>還有一個鄕村的村長，他是在本地最受人尊敬的一個紳士。他常常對着他所認識的人稱讚他的女人，他很得意地説：「我的女人在年輕的時候，是沒有一個女子比得她上的，因爲她有着最多的「凱爾特啊！」這話的意思是説沒有一個女子能夠像他的夫人一様和許多男子度夜的。原來在瑞士的一部分地方，沒有出嫁的少女常是在星期六的晚上毫無拘束的和她們的情郎度夜，人家一點也不爲奇怪的。</p>
<h3>自殺的統計</h3>
<p>— 靑浩</p>
<p>「殺」是多麽可怕，但，在這世界，偏有許多人自殺，難道他們是活得不耐了嗎？</p>
<p>這裏，有幾種關於自殺的數字：　　據紐約人壽保險公司的統計，去年美人自殺者達二萬餘人，即每十萬人中有二十人自殺。一九一五年佔二○·八，一九○八年佔二一·五·Ｗｉｓｃｃｎｓｉｎ省之首府共有人口五萬八千，其自殺人數比例爲四四·八。</p>
<p>又據紐約保健局統計、去年紐約之自殺者有一千五百人·較一九三○年增九十七人，四分之三係用以下幾種方法自殺的：</p>
<p>工具　　男　　女</p>
<p>毒瓦斯　　四○八　一六九自縊　　　一五二　二二跳樓　　　九三　　九一手槍　　　八九　　四毒藥　　　六六　　五六刀類　　　四七　　五</p>
<p>據德國統計局發表調查，去年自殺人數共達一萬八千名，即每十萬人中至少有三十人自殺。九三二年前四月，僅柏林一處，其自殺人數即達七百人。　　日本因窮兵　武，經濟恐慌較他國尤甚，自殺人數亦較他國爲尤多。據内閣統計局發表，日本自殺人數每日平均有五十八名。自今年一月至四月自殺者有六百九十四人，其中女子佔三分之一，年歲大多在二十一歲至二十五歲之間。</p>
<h3>科學新兵器（三）</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>第三種可怕的新兵器，是殺人光線和怪力線。這兩種線於大戰末期，便已喧騰於世。後來法國的赫拉克氏，意大利的維里菲氏·英國的馬休士氏，都不絶的潛心研究這種光線效力，能殺傷人馬，阻止坦克車和飛機的運轉，使遠距離的火藥庫突然爆發。如果這兩種光線一旦被利用爲新式兵器，則現代一切軍備都將完全失其價值。但世人大都不很相信這兩種光綫的效力，　們説，這不過是「吹牛或是」「寓言」罷了。</p>
<p>其實這兩種光綫，都是由極短電波構成，是信而有徵的事實，無論人和馬，觸着了這種光線·一臟或細胞便會起一種强烈的發熱作用，且因所觸「波度」的長短，而分傷害的重輕。這事曾經有人對動物試騐過，都很準確。所以這兩種線便被公認爲新式武器了。他如：眩眼光線，殺人光線，殺人音波等也都是將來軍器上的怪物，這裏可以附带一述。　　殺人音波，是美國瓊斯合布根斯大學伍德和雷米斯二敎授發現的。法以一種特殊的電氣機，使電波每秒的振動數增至十萬至數十萬，然後用這種音波，去射殺數人，這種高周音波，爲耳所不能聞，稱爲「無聲音波」，受了這種音波的振動，個動物便於痴　狀態之下，死過去了。</p>
<p>據發現者所發表的意見説，這種音波因與生物體的各細胞組織發生共嗚作用，故受其振動便至死亡。發現者曾試騐水中的游魚和蛙，都得到一様的效果。　　上述新兵器如殺人光綫，怪力線，殺人音波等，因爲製造時所需動力極大·而其有效範圍，都很窄小，所以迄今未見實際上採作兵器，也許將來經過更深邃的研究，能爲一般戰鬭上所利用的。　　以上是我戰鬭中應用的兵器，此外，還有幾種電氣的警備兵器。先説電氣眼罷。這也是一種光線，爲肉眼所不能見，其電氣神經遍佈各處，都取得連絡。例如：在海岸要塞，各處設有大砲，都設有電氣眼互相連絡，只須有一處地方發現敵艦，則所有大砲都可集中射擊，這様，傾刻之間，便可使這隻敵艦沉沒。　　其次，就是電氣耳。最高及最低的音波爲人類耳朶所不能聽聞，（音波每秒振動數最低二十及最高二萬的，都不能爲人類耳朶所聞），但電氣耳却可聽得出來。裝有電氣耳的一方，可以探聽敵方的一切佈置，雖然敵方曾有消音的裝置。牠可以發現敵人的所在，或知會友軍報告攻擊已經開始，還有高周音波，因爲有强烈的指向性，（即向着一定方向推進的性質）和反射性，所以在黑夜海戰時，也可發現肉眼不能看見的敵艦，且能測知其距離，加以猛烈的轟擊。　　未來電氣支配了兵器的世界，現在的毒瓦斯，坦克車，飛艇，這一類利器較之未來的電氣兵器，相差真不可以道里計了。科學兵器的進步，也許會有發現絶滅全人類的利器之一日，這類器具的發現，大槪就是戰爭被廢止的時候吧。</p>
<h3>齊伯林之成績</h3>
<p>德國大飛艇『齊伯林』號，自出世以德來，迄今年十一月三日重回弗烈得烈許哈芬本站爲止，計共作過飛行二百九十次，經過五十三萬又六百餘公里，所用飛行時間共五千三百六十九小時，故就其速度而論，每小時約爲一百公里（按一公里合中國市里一里又三分之二）。所載乘客前後總共七千四百九十五人。若僅就本年言之·則自今年正月一日開始，至十一月三日爲止，飛行次數共五十八，飛行時間爲一千七百六十六小時，所經里數共十八萬又七百八十八里，所載乘客共一千二百十八人，郵件之經其運載者共二千七百四十五公斤（一公斤合二磅二有奇），或一百萬件信件。其所運之貨物總最約爲二千餘公斤。自出世至今，往返南美洲計已十三次，其中五次均達利哇德耶納魯爲止。</p>
<p>長篇創作</p>
<h3>長篇創作時代与愛的歧路二十二</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>曹世光伸出三個指頭來。　　「那末，除掉了車貲，就沒有多少了」。</p>
<p>「還不是」？</p>
<p>林海泉知道這位同鄕是風流不過的靑年。他進了Ｃ大學後，是一面讀書，一面進行戀愛。因爲他患了飢不擇食的毛病，並且只求價廉而物不必美，于是他的一個朋友姓段的把他所無法解决的一個女友推讓給他了。據同鄕的一般人説，那個女人的懷裏，已經有了姓段的種子。</p>
<p>那個女人名呌李蕙英。果然，自和曹世光同樓了七個多月，便產了一個小女兒。現在的曹世光是一面求學一面理家務了。由海泉看來，他的近來的生活實在是慘澹得令人同情。</p>
<p>『老林。　我介紹你進敎會去好麽？』　　『有什麽好處？』海泉笑着問。</p>
<p>『信仰宗敎，不問有好處沒有好處。』　　『算了吧。』海泉望着世光的假裝着正經的臉，笑了。</p>
<p>『　貨真多丨並且都是相當人家的小姐丨』　　『你進行了麽？』　　『我此刻才後悔了。現在還有什麽辦法？』曹世光搖了搖頭，嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>看見公共汽車駛來了。　　『走吧。』世光拉了拉海泉的衣袖。　　『到那裏去？』　　『我介紹你見哈巴牧師去。今天五點多鐘有一個祈禱禱，做過了祈禱會，那個老番頭一定會請我們吃一頓晚餐的。』</p>
<p>海泉本來是一個現代大學生，虚應故事，下了課之後，便無事可做了的。今天出來，也沒有特别的目的。給曹世光一拉，他就上了公共汽車。賣票的走到他倆面前來了。</p>
<p>『到啥地方？』　　『到什麽地方？』海泉忙着數銅板，一面數，一面轉問曹世光。　　『Ｈ路口。······我有銅板，讓我付。』　　世光一面説，一面伸手進他的半舊的洋服袋裏去亂抓。抓了一刻，還不見把銅板抓出來。海泉的兩份車資已經數好了。</p>

<h3>爲民覔求工作</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>據國民社十五日柏林電，德新總理施來轍在無線電台演説，謂行政之方針，一言以蔽之，曰爲民覓求工作，蓋民之所急者唯在茲至於修正憲法及其他不能止飢之種種佳事，皆非政府所願，唯商業之復興，始能終止失業之恐慌，但以空言慰民，謂荒年之後，必有豐年，此實無濟於事，故内閣現正草擬偉大之計劃，爲民覓求工作，</p>
<p>這確是各國爲政者，當前的急務，因爲在現代資本主義生活方式之下，一方面是人浮於事，全世界失業人數已超出三千萬丨中國沒有統計，一萬萬大槪相差不遠吧，丨而另一方面，是貨棄於地，機器空關，傾棄水麥，限種田，種種矛盾的現象，在整個經濟制度沒有澈底改造以前，是無法改善的，</p>
<p>德國自大戰以後，受着賠欵的負担，市塲的被奪，失業人數的增加，財政破產，國幾不國，但日耳曼人終具有日耳曼人的特質，有銅鐵般體魂，有鋼一般的意志，終於萊茵撤兵，邀入國聯，修改賠欵計劃，國勢蒸蒸日上，使貼粼的法蘭西寢寐難安，近更續極訓練靑年，立張恢復徵兵制，要求軍備均等，使西歐諸國爲之惴惴不安，一個　疲球居然漲起來了，這不是奇蹟，這是日耳曼人全國上下十年奮鬥的結果，看到人家的努力，真使我們不爭氣的民族漸愧無地，</p>
<p>論理二三個人，同様地具有兩手兩足，一付腦筋，對社會是負着同様的責任，誰能不飮食，便誰可不工作，但在現社會之下，「吃家當」尚成一名詞，而「吃能力」，則尚未普遍，當局者是無暇來問你有衣食沒有，有工作沒有，政府常常閙窮，然而地未盡　，物未盡用，人未盡力，在現社會上一部份人是閑散看沒事做，一部份人是雖有工作而等於沒有，工人整天工作着，還担憂夜裏睡下去不要發寒熱，子女一要增多，農民播種耘耨，整歲的勤勞，還愁今年年飯不知有否着落，生活這様的沒保障，社會那得有生氣，所以沒有工作做的，固應給以工作，已有工作做的，這須切實保障其生活的安定，</p>
<h3>葡萄酒</h3>
<p>— 冷梅</p>
<p>葡萄酒之酒精含分各有不同，各國著名之葡萄酒以葡萄芽之樸酒（Ｐｏｒｅ）之酒精含量爲最高，爲一四至二四％，西班芽之舒力酒（Ｓｈｅｒｒｙ）次之，約十六至十八％，意國之麻薩酒（Ｍａｘｓａｌａ）含十六％，法國之勃艮第（Ｂｕｒｇｕｎｄｙ）酒含一○·五％，德國之萊茵酒（Ｒｈｉｎｅ）含量最少爲一○·二％</p>
<p>葡萄酒之製法，可以新鮮之葡萄汁置於醱酵桶中醱酵，因空中每存有一種葡萄之糖酵素能自由寄生於新鮮之葡萄汁中，繁殖甚速，因而自然醱酵，醱酵時之温度需保持一○至一二度，所用之醱酵桶並不加蓋，因需用少量之空氣。　　（空氣接觸過多時易使葡萄汁中生醋酸菌，致酒味變酸，是宜注意。）經十五日後，分盛罇中，不須密蓋，待醱酵數月，俟其中之糖分完全變爲酒精，澄清，倒入木桶，密蓋存儲於冷地窖中待酒成熟時，有特殊之香味，此種香味乃由葡萄汁中所含之芬芳物質與酒中所含之各種醇類及有機酸相化合而成有機　類所致。葡萄酒發黴時能使顏色變淡而呈臭味，故須用消毒法消毒，以酒瓶於六○度之熱水中煑過，使其中附有之各種微生物消滅，但所用温度不可過高，以防損害酒味，加酒精於酒中亦能使葡萄酒較爲安定，並有較强之耐菌性。</p>
<p>上品之葡萄酒並不加入化物。普通之酒，如以淡弱，則可加以味强之酒，味酸，可加以旋化糖以補充之，如嫌淡薄，可加甘油以濃厚之，是皆能彌補所製葡萄酒之各種缺點。</p>
<p>現今市面上所通行之白蘭地酒，亦可用已釀成之葡萄酒蒸餾之，此種蒸出之澄明液約含酒精四五％至五五％，須用橡樹所製之木桶盛之，久則漸呈淡黄色，具特殊之酒味。</p>
<p>有酒名香檳酒者亦以葡萄爲原料。此酒以法國出產最富，含有酒精八·四至九·八％</p>
<p>其製法先以品質最佳之葡萄汁置於桶中，待渣滓完全沉底後，（約歷二十四小時至三十六小時。將澄清之液汁注入醱酵桶中，待醱酵至十五日後，改盛於密蓋之罇中，加入少許之白蘭地酒，至冬節再加以少量之魚膠，二月間再加一次，至五月間加入二％之蔗糖漿及適量之麯而後裝瓶緊塞之，令於二十四小時中醱酵後，置於瓶床上，歷時約一年至二年之久，在夏至時，麯渣漸漸沉下，至冬令乃以瓶加冷，倒懸而搖動之，則麯渣均附着於木塞·將木塞迅速揭開，則麯渣自然射去，然後速將加糖之白蘭地酒補入，改換新塞，以鐵絲緊紮，使其中之糖分完全醱酵爲二氧化碳與酒精，此類所得之酒名爲乾氣酒，如酒中糖質醱酵未盡即已停止者，則所得之酒名爲甜氣酒，不及乾氣酒之適口。</p>
<h3>斷垣殘壨弔吳淞</h3>
<p>— 符</p>
<p>今年，我底摯友囂囂和航夫，在這吳淞的一個學校裏念書，我們舊日的友誼，使我們時常互相懷想着，我因此約了幾個朋友到吳淞去。</p>
<p>我們一行三個人，就在一個細雨濛濛的早晨，到寳山路車站跳上了第一班的蒸汽火車。火車拖得異常的慢，這倒給與我們一個賞識沿途風景的機會。沿途有着不易看到的景色，不是樹林，不是湖山，不是巍巍的大厦，也不是矮小的茅屋。車軌的兩旁都是一堆堆的瓦礫，都是高樓巨厦殘餘的輪廓，我們沉靜地賞識着，賞識着這大毁權後的景色，説也慙愧，我們並沒有激昂，也並沒有憤慨，我們只是沉默地一壁看着，一壁金錢萬能天堂与地獄漢光</p>
<p>聽着一個穿破舊的中山裝的人，高聲的指示，他似乎同情我們的生疏，所以不斷地在指示我們：「這是復旦大學，這是持志大學，這是勞動的大學，·····」並且不斷地歎着氣發感慨，我們大家都有些黯然，而我尤其感到幻滅的悲哀：我國堂堂的大學，祇剩了這些七零八落的破門面了！唉！</p>
<p>車到吳淞，我們雇了三輛「包車」式的人力車，呌他們拉到我們朋友所在的那個××大學裏去，車夫們聽了似乎格外的巴結，都飛也似地奔去，他們大約當我們就是這里的學生吧，學生自然被當爲特權階級啊！三個人沒命地跑了一會，就把我們三個人拖到那個地方。</p>
<p>××大學是經過了劇烈的砲火得倖　　免於滅亡的一個，據說，也有許多部分是遭轟崩了的，現在都修　好了仔細看來，確還有着遍體鱗傷的痕跡。囂囂和航夫很殷勤地陪伴着我們先在他們的校裏踱了幾個圈子，在體堂的外室，我看到三塊記念的銅碑，被紀念的人有一個是我們的「國」人，其餘的二個德國人，就ＰａｕｌｕｎＰｅｒｕｎｓ於是，我想：我們這個「國」立大學之得能倖免於全部滅亡，可還不是叨了他們老人家的光？這可紀念的意義，又豈僅在於他們經營「本校」的勳績？</p>
<p>我們的隊伍，從三個增加到五個了。我們五個人，喝着滿口的西北風，循了海濱步行着。海濱的土阜，一堆堆的忽高忽低，有大有小，有椭圓形的有長方形的，據説這是戰壕。也有是給開花彈所造成的，海濱一些也沒有屋子了，在殘鑠堆中還能發現幾家旅館的招牌。我們一直走着，走到砲台的面前，望見那「僅有的」兩尊機關槍似的砲口，驕傲地朝南注視着，我們要想走近去看，但是給「奉諭不准參觀，砲台管理員白」的木牌告示阻住了，而且面前更有着鐵絲網，和拿了上剌刀的長槍直立着的陸軍似的！不知怎的，我對於這個拿剌刀的人倒還不害怕而覺得十分可憐，我想那從四面吹攏來的海陸風，當已夠他喝了罷？我們在砲台的下面竚立着，大家想着二百幾十天以前的這裏，大家似乎都起了一種憑弔古戰塲的情緒。</p>
<p>我們走到市街，市街有着煥然的新氣象！全市幾十家的商舖，沒有一家不是漆得黄亮亮綠油油的狹仄的街道中，充滿着桐油石灰的香氣。這市街和我的家鄕的一様，於是我覺得我彷佛已回到了家鄕，而且今年的夏天，家鄕邊的最熱閙的市街上發生了大火，延燒了一長街，現在已經重建了起來，全街也充滿着桐油石灰氣。毁滅之後才有建設，所以我們有鄕的習俗，失火之後，一定先要謝火神，大槪因爲是他促進我們去建設！於是，我看到吳淞市鎭重建以後簇新的氣象，覺得歡喜，深深地以爲應當先要東向謝恩，謝他給與我們毁滅丨</p>
<h3>車廂裏的女拆白</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>爲的要公，急怱怱的踏上火車。　　本來，記得每當私事回到故鄕，因爲短少孔方兄，畢竟要在充溢着土氣和惡味的四等車裏，過那怪不舒服的旅行生活，可是現在却根本打失了常態，在我四下的都是一雙的佳偶情侶，不時地隨風飄來了一陣陣的芬芳香氣，還有那幾位吃得雪白滾壯的滿面福相的大人先生。對的，有了一張頭等車票的「派司」，纔有給我這般享受。車輪在動了，這時，我的對座已塡上了一位如花如玉的妙齡女郎：在一陣嬉笑之下，車子遙遠的離了上海。</p>
<p>「哈囉！借根洋火來。」她，她带着引誘性的清脆的微笑的口吻，向我説道。</p>
<p>「好。」自然我該將原匣遞給她，在這一刹那間，於是我的心靈開始震　起</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>來，很忸怩地想到；難道呆人也有呆福麽？難道我是交了桃花運麽？真的，我便藉此很親熱的欣然地攀談起來。</p>
<p>「府上呢丨」</p>
<p>「蘇州；女士的口音，聽來府上大槪是南京吧？」</p>
<p>「是的，舍間就在中正街×號，有便請來談談。現在到那裏去？」　　「稍有雜務，也是上南京去。」　　「啞！巧極了，我們同行吧，下車順便可到舍間去歇息歇息。」</p>
<p>「不，不，對不起，因爲馬上要到××部去哩。」</p>
<p>「難道休息的辰光多沒有嗎？」　　「這次實在急於接洽事宜，只好下次又拜訪了。」</p>
<p>「接洽的什麽？」　　「公司裏的欵項事呢。」　　「哈哈哈，是的是的，那末我們都勿要客氣啦！」她更是聲笑交流，簡直笑得使人有些享受不住！我們談着，沿了車窗，憑眺着自然界的美景。外别的故鄕丨蘇州是到了，呀丨富有詩意的古城。</p>
<p>照例的車停下站來，許多旅人在擠上擠下。</p>
<p>「北寺塔裏我也去玩過，哎，那次走上塔尖去，從遠眺而俯瞮，幾乎把我駭得要命，哈哈。」她指着塔説：「啊，啊！我隻帽子掉下站去了，我·····」</p>
<p>「好好，好的，我去拾，你留心這裏。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你！」</p>
<p>「她呢？哎喲，還有我的錢包呢？」</p>
<p>當我拾到了帽子，發現她不在座次的時候，禁不住的呐喊。</p>
<p>「先生，要當心，車子上女拆白多着兮丨」那個死様怪氣的茶房却是冷冰冰的向我嘲笑説。</p>
<p>唉！無情的火車依然在那裏前進！</p>
<h3>江北婦人與摩登女子</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>前天在閔行搭長途汽車赴滬，當買了票，走進車廂的時候見已擁擠滿車，坐無𨻶地，知道自己來得太遲，致失坐�</p>
<p>位的利權，祇得手吊皮带站立着，但其時距開車鐘點還有十五分鐘，所以乘客比我後來的，還有，只見有兩位身穿藍布衫，耳堕大號銀圓，脚小零丁的江北婦人，也行色愴惶的，急急忙忙地，跑上車廂，一見這滿坑滿谷的樣子，兩人的臉上立刻都顯露了侷促不安的狀態，而相顧着説：「葵葵！要死人了！沒得坐位哩丨」一邊説，一邊在排衆直入地擠進來，冀求覓得一席地，但事實已是不可能了，祇得也學我的法子，做三上吊似的，拉着皮带站着。</p>
<p>兩位江北婦人站的面前，正坐着一位西裝革履的摩登靑年，我見他面現不快之色，時時側目怒視着她們，好像在怪着她們不應進來，使他討厭，更不識相地站立在他新人物的面前，省得碰着了他漂亮的西裝，傳染着江北婦人的齷齪的酸味窮氣，我想這摩登靑年必定要發出惱怒的脾氣，那知却不然，但見他非但不討厭她們，還在熱心的好好地，代她們謀劃出路，而向着她們説：「你們這里不好坐，後面還要開一部，坐到後邊去好了，「兩位江北婦聽了答道：「先生丨我們問過了後邊這部車要二點鐘開哩丨還要等一個鐘頭，」説畢，好像不以摩登靑年的話爲然，仍然屹立不動，他聽了，急忙道：「你們不要誤會，這部車（指坐的一部）也要二點鐘開的，與後面一部，是同時開的啊！」他這様一説，她們兩人，就快樂了起來，以爲一様二點鐘開，樂得坐到後面空車上去，何等地舒適，於是笑嘻嘻的，急手急脚地，下車而去，當婦人走下了車的時候，只聽見他在自言自語的説：「討厭！給她槓一個木梢。」</p>
<p>票已軋過，三分鐘之後，車子就要開了，那知還有一位妙齡的摩登女郎，上來，一上車，她的衣香肉香芬芳四射，引動得滿座的人，都向她注意，她見了「座上客滿」的様子，就掉轉頭來，自言自語：「人介多丨不好坐，到後邊一部去，」説畢，已回身想下車，只見剛才呌江北婦人坐向後邊一部車的摩登靑年，忽然地向她道：一女士丨後邊一部還要等一個鐘頭開哩丨你不好坐，來，來，來，我這里讓你，」説畢，慷慨地立起來，恭而敬之地，將坐位獻給女郎坐，自己却站在剛才江北婦人站的地方，也就是女郎的面前啊，俄而車已開動了，他和她已在「密司丨密司脫！」地高談闊論了，但不知他還記得，兩位江北婦人，平白地等在空車裏一個鐘頭。</p>
<h3>一張有意義的賀年片</h3>
<p>— 學范</p>
<p>每年年底，一般人都歡悦地期待着新年的來臨，以爲一陽轉泰，來年當有更好的運命；就是思想清楚一些不相信命運的人，也認一年之計在於春，這春季的開始，確然是值得紀念的。故歷年來大家有一個互相祝頌的賀年舉動，積習難移，竟相習成風了。</p>
<p>可是近年來的賀年，大都以賀年片代替本人踵門祝賀了。不過在這國家江河破碎，胡騎縱横的當兒，如再一味恭賀新禧，未免太不識時務了。至少今年的賀年，要含蓄一些國難的印象，和带些對於將要淡忘的腦筋，所予以的剌激，像這様的賀年片，猶不失爲有些意義吧，我有一位朋友，他最近印一分賀年片，其措辭實獲我心，因亟轉錄，以饗同好，而資觀摩。原文如下，</p>
<p>「試看今日之東北，尚是誰家之天下？版圖變色，胡騎縱横！四萬萬人民醉生夢死，那裏是我們一線的微光呢？靑年們！起來吧，把我們的槍口，永遠瞄準着我們的敵人，共同挽救這行將沈淪的民族，和共同喚起這埀死的國魂，際此一陽開始，大地回春，希望你更能以新的力量，加緊你的工作·更能以新的計劃，發展你的前程·老友！流光如駛，不應當更着一鞭嗎？恭祝前程無疆！」</p>
<h3>尊「王」擁「后」&lt;</h3>
<p>— 石公</p>
<p>在這年頭兒，總統也玩得有些膩煩，最摩登的，一個一個指頭扳過去，要輪到主席，委員。甚麽「皇」，甚麽「王」，已經日薄崦　，到了進歷史愽物院的時候了。我們東北「滿洲國」的溥儀大執政，識時務，到了黄河兀是心不死，當愧　執政不　　還要想　　　還要想稱孤道寡。逆着潮流向我轉，真可謂荒天下之大唐。</p>
<p>「皇」呀，「王」呀，現在已不甚時髦附屬着的「后」，當然也隨之不打而倒。可是現在上海的市面上，却復辟的空氣濃厚之至。一般挺胸突肚的大老　，挖空心思，製造成了一種東西，防着人家要仿造，冒牌·於是替他所做的東西，加上一個尾巴·呌做「大王」如此一來，無論人家如何仿造，冒牌，似乎都未有呌大王的來得道地。譬如賣便壺的，便把他所賣的便壺，呌做「便壺大王」。賣飯桶的，便把他所賣的飯桶，呌做「飯桶大王」。這種稱謂，雖然其動機，就不過要表示此便壺飯桶之所以異於他便壺飯桶，然究嫌復辟的氣味太重，有些不合潮流。</p>
<h3>嶽廬隨筆</h3>
<p>— ·般·若</p>
<p>㈠冬天的寄宿</p>
<p>雖然她是社會的另一角，而此中形色，却不亞於十字街頭的錯綜複雜，記得阿榮是犯竊盜罪而被判二月的有期徒刑，在期滿後重見天日的那天，誰個不曉得恢復自由的快樂，而阿榮確是做了一個反常的比例，當他懇求看守長時，可憐的他眼淚也流了下來，</p>
<p>「謝謝看守長！留我再登幾天吧，這様冷煞人天氣，工又找不到來做，出去也無啥法子想，做好事的看守長······」</p>
<p>「哈哈！你還把監獄來當做旅館住。」看守長带着滑稽似的笑答説，真的住旅館還要付房錢，而况有房子住有飯吃的監獄，他還怕什麽吃官司的呢，</p>
<p>㈡獄中題詞</p>
<p>假如你去所謂模範監獄參觀時，那末你就可以發現大手筆的題字，什麽「×××小住八年四月有奇，」的紀念字様，「天將降大任於是人也，必先坐其監獄，」甚至也有沒坐監的不算英雄，」「再來此地者會變狗熊。」的感嘆句子，於是可見一般綁票，强盜，老槍，小癟三，政治犯，在這牆壁上，名人戲筆似的大書特書，真是琳琅滿目，美不勝收，鐵窗風味，或亦别有趣味麽，　　有「大王」，同時還有「皇后」白粉牆的最高學府裏，在一校的女同學之中，誰的學問最好，臉蛋兒最漂亮，身段兒最苗條，行頭裝飾最摩登，交際手段最靈活，一切都在水平線上，而總平均分數最多的，其餘的同學，就都五體投地的甘心在高跟鞋五做奴隷，而尊她爲「皇后」。本來，旣有「大王」，當然要有「皇后」。但是「大主」旣不合潮流，「皇后」，當然也非合乎時代的。</p>
<p>「大王」，「皇后」，風行一時的今日，日報中的老大哥，有六十年歷史的本報，倒也很可以自誇自大地稱一聲「日報大王」。本增刋是「大王」的附屬品，也很可以自命爲「本埠皇后」。但是真金不怕火，我们儘用不到這様地大吹大擂，這様地利用不合時代潮流，饒有復辟氣味的尊號。溥儀大執正的夢想復辟，我也認爲具多此一舉。上海的一切「大王」「皇后」，實有一舉廓清之必要，我們不可儘着開倒車。</p>
<p>小説</p>
<h3>寫信給友人之妻（十三續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>啊！小兄弟！她這兩句話才出口，我已經窘得把混身的肌肉，全緊張了起來：恨不能打開一塊窗，立刻跳下去逃走。</p>
<p>但是，美麗的不猪玀丨别慌丨我已經是特地爲着要保護你的名譽，所以不惜一死而出走：這時候，豈有再肯給她瞧出破綻之理。</p>
<p>「哈哈丨哈哈丨」我用混身的力量，抓住了我的心，不使　有一些蕩動：接着，又學着她的狂態，前俯後仰的盡情地笑着。</p>
<p>「這不是笑可以掩飾的！」她真是一個可怕的女人。「你們的事情，那一天，我和林寳誠親眼在兆豐公園見到了。不是你和周大經的妻子，兩個在那兒情話綿綿嗎？」</p>
<p>她要盤問我，不料自己倒先招出真情來了：她和林寳誠有什麽關係？雙雙上兆豐公園去幹什麽的？然而，我也正害着虚心病，因此不便再和她取笑；忙着要給你作有力的解説。</p>
<p>「沒有這事！大槪還是你們兩個人的眼花丨」我竭力鎭定，像一個牧師一様。</p>
<p>「笑話丨你這一張鬼臉，我們還會瞧不清楚嗎？就是大經的妻子，還有三分疑問：不過據林實誠説，」她居然大發慈悲的自動地退讓了三步。「那個人的確是她。然而你也不用着急，我决不肯替人家挑撥是非的。何况······」</p>
<p>她臉上完全堆着一種極藐視的訕笑，使我萬難忍受。</p>
<p>「這種話關係很大，你們不能胡説丨」我不讓她再放肆，立刻打斷了她的話。「我現在馬上可以賭咒給你聽：如其我真有那麽一回事的話，在一年之内，我一定會給人家殺頭，或是槍斃：而且子孫滅絶，骨肉分離！</p>
<p>我賭的差不多全是眼前快要實現的事實。</p>
<p>親愛的小兄弟丨賭咒本來是愚蠢人的下策。然而，在萬分無難的當兒，就是不愚蠢的人，有時也不得不利用　；尤其在女人的面前，賭咒往往會有絶大的效果。</p>
<p>「咦丨何必呢！你至今還是小孩子氣丨」她果然因爲我賭的咒太認鬹，太狠毒的緣故，便信以爲是真屬寃枉了。「爲什麽賭這様血淋淋的毒咒？其實，我原也不信真有這回事，方才不過隨便和你取笑取笑而已！」</p>
<p>她一軟化，我便像打背脊上卸下了一副千斤石擔一般的頓時覺得輕鬆了許多。可惜不曾早些知道，現在那一位小流氓丨林寳誠丨的心上，也許還藏着這一圑神秘咧。我至可愛的小寶貝！這是我畢生的遺憾。請你格外的寛恕了我吧！</p>

<p>海外珍聞</p>
<h3>對於黄柳霜的希望</h3>
<p>— 愛蓮</p>
<p>無論誰都知道，中國人在好萊塢有立足之地的，除去一個黄柳霜之外，只剩下楊愛立了。她還正在研究中·談不到稱什麽明星。聊能自慰的，在藝術界中，還有一位黄宗祜，他已升了福斯公司的基本攝影師。珍妮蓋諾的幾張巨片·多半是黄君拍製的。　　這是很可憐的，五萬萬民衆的大國在世界電影集中區，僅僅佔了這麽一點小地位。</p>
<p>事情更奇怪了，好萊塢僅有的華籍女星黄枊霜却又被英國的萬國公司請去了。</p>
<p>英國近來對於電影業：非常的重視，打算把世界上對於電影的視綫，完全由好萊塢轉移到英倫三島上來。今年夏天，英國政府特下了一個命令，禁止全國電影明星出境。同時又用最優赿的薪金·來吸引美國已成名的大明星，派了專員，長駐在好萊塢，一有滿期的合同，或其他的巧遇，就立刻乘機而進，把一顆顆明星搬到大西洋的東岸去，半年功夫，真搜羅了不少·到現在我們的黄小姐，居然也中雀屏之選，大槪不久我們就會在英國片中看見她。</p>
<p>這次，可以算是「榮行」，因爲英國給她的地位，比在美國高升多了，允許她至少充一個副主角。</p>
<p>普通中國人對於她，總覺得她是一個無祖國觀念的拜金主義者，因爲多少次中國影界請回國效力，她都置之不理，以現在中國影業的末落，當然沒有像美國所給她的薪金那麽豐富。</p>
<p>她受了物質上的享樂，却對於精神工作於不顧了。常常會有不利於中國的影片，她也秉了大無畏的精神去作。便如十多年前的「紅燈罩」·七八年前的「海狼」，最近的「上海快車」，那一張片子不是增加中國的恥辱？</p>
<p>「不咎旣往」一切不必談了這次她去英國，是歐洲第一個華籍演員了。希望她再不要作金錢的奴僕出賣人格了，好好的幹結歐州人認識中國人的才能和毅力，創一個新局面，給人們一個好印象，爲國家爭一些體面，中國永久不會忘了這藝術之星丨黄小姐丨的。</p>
<p>讀者意見</p>
<h3>鄕村電影院的需要</h3>
<p>— 島生</p>
<p>電影的功效，是誰都知道的。她不僅是欣賞品，不僅是消遣品，更不僅是供人們解悶兒玩具，她具有改造社會的威力，她是改良社會的最佳工具。的確，一部好的影片丨业部有意義的影片底收效，要比政府法令所生的效果來得大而且迅速，</p>
<p>近來，政府也感覺到電影敎育之重要，認爲是社會敎育之極有效的工具，而將努力推行了。因此，我感覺到鄕村電影院的需要。</p>
<p>事實上，目前電影院的所在地，大都是都市：至於有着衆多農民的鄕村之間，很少有它的蹤跡。這當然是因爲電影院的設立者祗顧到金錢進益，而沒有顧到其他方面的收入之故，有以形成，但是，鄕村中電影院之需要程度，實不亞於都市。我想鄕村中有了電影院，放映真實的有意義的佳片·工農羣衆們一定會在工作之餘，欣然而來。真不難以娛樂的方法達到敎育的目的，啓發民智，改良習慣，解除鄕村中種種暗影。</p>
<p>最好由政府襄助各地行政當局，在各該地的鄕村中廣大地設立起來，以極低廉的座價，供工農羣衆觀看，最好是完全免費。</p>
<h3>影界的榮譽</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>ＭａｙｆａｉｒＣｌｕｂ是加利福尼亞最有名的總會ｃ許多有名的社交家和小明星，都爲會員，可是歷届選舉，總沒有優伶當選爲會長的，更沒有女伶被選爲副會長的。不過今年所選出的會長，却是ＦｒｅｄｅｒｉｃＭａｒｃｈ副會長是腦瑪希拉。這是好萊塢影界的榮幸呀。</p>

<h3>曼麗畢克馥小史</h3>

<p>曼麗畢克馥的影片，在好萊塢的喜劇中，算得是最受人歡迎了，尤其是她的作風，最易受一般孩童的歡迎，因爲她純潔爛漫的孩童氣槪，十足迎合孩童們的熱望·所以全美有三百萬以上的孩童，熱烈擁護着她的作品·當她的影片在戲院開映時·戲院老閩，須得預備犧牲四份之二的座位，讓與這許多半價小孩們！自從她轉變作風之後，于是歡迎她的孩童·對她都冷淡了，同時離去了一大半數小孩</p>
<p>她是英國人，自小生長在加拿大的，家况十分窮困·她的父親·是在紐約某劇院裏當茶役的·所以她們的生活祇祗能草草過去·她九歲時·因爲有中經濟不裕·所以她爲補助經濟不足，便進了她父親任職的劇院裏·當個額外的小女伶·每天倒也有一元的薪水呢·後來，她的天真爛漫的表情·及活潑的體態，清脆的歌喉·的確很能搏得了當地人士的讚美，她的聲譽，因而也一天高似一天了·十五歲時，便和這戲院訂了二年的合同·她每星期的薪水，竟一躍而至六百元。二年後，合同期滿了，她才爲聯藝公司請了去當演員。從這時，她便開始了銀幕生活。十八歲，即下嫁于一個當時著名電影演員虞文爾。可是不久即，生了齟齬而離婚了。自後她即開始在銀燈下奮門·結果居然使他成了銀壇最燦爛的一顆影星。這時他才知范朋克結識了，她倆的愛情漸漸融洽而終于結爲夫婦。她們倆曾一度得電影皇后和電影皇帝的尊號，並且還是好萊塢最美滿的姻緣。</p>

<p>「吾當幾時再來？」她很迷惑的問，「吾們需用你時當再通知你做散工是沒有一定的，一給她雇金的人很有趣味地對她説，她就全無知覺地慢呑呑的走回家中等待再受雇用，</p>
<p>在以後的幾個月裏，她被招的次數逐漸加多，在「深淵的呼聲」裏她那悽慘而冷淡無情的態度，在一羣婦女前走着，使凡是看這片子的人，都受到一個極深的影像，幾乎每個評論總　　評論到這一幕，而當映到這一幕時，觀衆們幾乎要停止他們的呼吸</p>
<p>關於社會問題的影片，這年很爲盛行，她在羣衆的一幕裏，表演已成習慣，有她在裏面這一幕就好像要真切得多，</p>
<p>特立加百司基不再寂寞了，有時她感得沒有工作得太久了就會到影片公司委派部去，她的希望漸漸的大了，希望她的事業發揚可以多赚些錢，</p>
<p>她把第一次從影片上賺來的錢，付了醫生的醫業費，和她丈夫的喪葬費，又她把她唯一的獃呆而喜歡玩弄火柴的兒子，送進一個爲智識發育不完善的兒童而設的一個地方家庭襄，她自己所賺的雖已不多，不過總可稍爲自由的透一口氣了，</p>
<p>她曾失了當散工的職業。不過很僥倖的，她找到一個人租去了她空餘的房間，阿頓巴須是一個販冰爲生的鰥夫，他付十二個馬克一個月的房金和一半值的煤氣費，而且對她很親熱，如要愽得巴須的歡心她買了一件白色的斗篷，她又爲巴須做飯，她替他做带往外面吃的夾肉麵包，這顯得她自己還有更佳美的飯食，漸漸的她腀上的深凹和黑影都消失了，這時是在她事業的最高度，（未完）</p>

<h3>禮拜六狂歡？不狂歡？</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>好萊塢在一九二九，新起女明星是不少：伹是當時有人承認·能代替克拉寳的，只有耐珊卡珞ＮａｎｃｙＣａｒｒｏｌｌ，作品如「甜密密」·「香廚娘」，「靑春俱樂部」，等等，能給我們的印像，都是：甜和熱，和她久違了！當然在「狂歡禮拜六」ＨｏｔＳaturday的大廣告，一經光陸揭出，大家沒看以前，就會説這片子好來歡迎牠，不是我來掃興的説；牠好雖好，却鬹不如已往的，丨不如我們想象中的，</p>
<p>片子，仍是以愛爲中心，她飾一個銀行女職員，和一個風流才子戀愛了，不過因爲另一靑年的忌恨，所以被人造了許多謠言，又被人握着了把柄，丨禮禮拜六一夜未歸·丨於是銀行退職，家庭不容，此時另識一靑年學才，不料又因人言嘖嘖，而見疑，迨及學者悔悟，女郎却已和舊戀人，丨那風流才子丨上紐約結婚去了，</p>
<p>耐珊始終仍是可愛的小鹿，在情場上受着人的追逐，（按：此片原名爲情塲逐鹿），當片子未完時，的確有「不知死於誰手」之感，她應付男子，不接不離，带足了糼女的羞澀心情，不過那也是太可惜了，她把原有極甜極熱的天才，都沒法顯露出來，那能謂風流才子的克瑞格蘭ＣａｒｙＧｒａｎｔ，雖然名爲主角，表演殊少，成績也只好説不錯，飾靑年學者的藍道夫斯高特ＲａｎｄｏｌｐｈＳｃｏｔｔ，是很好，只是幽默的地方太多了，愛愛華武茲ＥｄｗａｒｄＷｏｏｄｓ，比較上最漂亮，最對工些，然這三個人，我認爲都不足以陪襯我們的甜姐兒，　　全劇旣以「狂歡」“Ｈｏｔｐ爲名，應當多一些禮拜六的狂歡，這片中實在狂歡得不夠，却把全力集中在「羅曼的克」上，所以攝影佈景，和光線，都極可取，處處呈獻着「月圓花好」，「萬籟無聲」，的美，</p>
<p>導演還可以看，分幕上增国加不少精彩，片段的素描，全片的述事，都有值得回憶的地方，側寫（暗塲）是非常巧妙，</p>
<p>片中意義，很淺薄，仍只説到金錢和戀愛的關係，個人與社會的矛盾，的確的，牠也許有促覺沉醉於「狂歡」女郎的效力，然而如果我作廣告，一定不説得像光陸所登的那麽嚴重，</p>
<p>耐珊，無疑的，比已往沒什麽進步，我仍説那句老話：</p>
<p>「片子是很好的，很美的，可以看的，不過不可先奢望於牠」質之白谷先生·以爲如何？</p>

<p>(A) Reports</p>
<p>(1) Reading of the Minutes of the Third Meeting</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Affairs Report (Original summary to be issued separately)</p>
<p>(B) Matters for Discussion</p>
<p>(1) Proposed by Committee Member Cheng Dafang to determine education standards and improve the system, and proposed by the Central Organization Committee to improve higher education. Resolved and passed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding national education: (1) National education should equip children with the necessary knowledge of a Chinese citizen. The content should include the Three Principles of the People, Chinese language, national history, geography, world history, geography, as well as preliminary knowledge of mathematics, hygiene, and natural sciences, enabling them to understand and apply it. Particular emphasis should be placed on training children in habits suitable for life, a spirit of perseverance and fortitude, and instilling in children the great deeds of the Chinese nation in the past, and the words and deeds of great figures, in order to strengthen their self-confidence and the concept of loving the country and loving the nation. (2) Elementary schools of four or six years should be used as venues for implementing national education. The Ministry of Education should formulate standards and promulgate them to all elementary schools nationwide for uniform compliance, without any deviation. If four-year elementary schools cannot be universally popularized for the time being due to financial constraints, then for the sake of rescuing the people at present, short-term compulsory education should be promoted in the shortest possible time, with the aim of universally establishing short-term elementary schools. (3) The central government and each province should each set a percentage of one year's revenue to subsidize the expansion of elementary schools in each county and city. This amount should be increased year by year, with the aim of popularizing national education to all children in the country after a certain number of years. (4) Existing school facilities and teachers should be utilized, or additional funding should be raised, to promote mass education, in order to establish the foundation of local autonomy.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding vocational education: (1) Elementary schools should teach production skills suitable to children's environment and cultivate their labor habits, so that elementary school graduates possess both national common knowledge and become members of social production. (2) Provinces and cities should expand vocational schools as much as possible. Private donations for establishing schools should also be encouraged by the provincial education departments or municipal education bureaus to establish vocational schools. Privately run vocational schools with good performance should be subsidized by the government. Public and private middle schools with poor performance or where there is no local need should all be converted into vocational schools. (3) Vocational schools should emphasize production skills and labor habits, without necessarily stipulating the same graduation years, and without necessarily dividing into agriculture, industry, commerce and other departments. They should focus on specialized departments according to local needs. (4) Vocational schools should in principle not charge tuition fees, so that poor children have the opportunity to enroll. (5) Advanced vocational schools should focus on specialized skills, and training must be integrated with practical training venues, and not just be book or theoretical education. (6) Advanced vocational schools should be gradually added by the Ministry of Education according to the needs of each province, taking into account urgency. (C) Regarding teacher education: (1) Secondary normal education institutions, such as simplified normal schools and normal schools, should all be run by the government. (2) Normal schools should be separated from middle schools and established independently. (3) Existing normal universities should strive for reorganization and improvement, so that their organization, curriculum, and discipline are all suitable for the purpose of training secondary school teachers, so as to distinguish them from ordinary universities, and to seek close contact with normal schools, etc. (4) Universities should establish teacher training classes. All university graduates who wish to become teachers should enter the class and take an additional year of education courses to prepare for the selection of secondary school teachers. All those entering the teacher training class should receive the same treatment as normal university students. (5) Normal schools and normal universities should not charge tuition fees. Normal schools should in principle be provided with food, lodging, and uniforms by the government. (6) After completing their studies, students of normal schools and normal universities should be assigned to locations designated by the Ministry of Education or the provincial or municipal education bureaus to serve. Graduation certificates will only be issued upon completion of the term of service, and they will then be free to seek employment or further their studies. Those who evade service or do not do their best in service will have their qualifications revoked and fees will be recovered. (D) Regarding talent education: (1) Middle schools are places for preparing talent and should raise their standards, enrich their content, and adopt an absolutely strict training principle. Existing middle schools should be reorganized or eliminated. Those requesting to establish new middle schools should be subject to strict standards and practical assessment and restrictions by the Ministry of Education. (2) Senior high schools should not be divided into arts and sciences. Existing senior high schools of industry, agriculture, commerce, etc. should all be converted into vocational schools. (3) Universities should raise their standards and enrich their content. The government should allocate large sums of money each year to expand the facilities of national universities and subsidize private universities with good performance. (4) Existing national, provincial, or private universities should be strictly reorganized by the Ministry of Education. Where the same departments are repeated in the same area, efforts should be made to merge them. Those with too poor performance and rampant academic atmosphere should be shut down immediately. (5) Both senior high schools and universities should set up a large number of scholarships to cultivate students from poor families with excellent grades. (6) Provinces, cities, and private universities or colleges should be limited to establishing colleges of agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, and science, and should not add colleges of arts and law. (7) The curriculum of universities and colleges should emphasize domestic teaching materials. (8) Private universities and colleges should be subject to graduation exams by the Ministry of Education, depending on the situation. (9) The Ministry of Education should formulate detailed principles and methods for moral education in universities and colleges to cultivate students' good character and strict discipline.</p>
<p>(2) Proposed by Committee Member Chen Guofu to reform the education plan. Resolved to be submitted to the Political Council.</p>
<p>(3) Proposed by Committee Member Zou Lu to request that funds be allocated for the construction of the new campus of Zhongshan University and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and to instruct the Ministry of Finance to clear the school's funding. Resolved to be submitted to the National Government for transfer to the Executive Yuan for investigation and handling. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>

<h3>Key Points of the Proposal to Circulate Domestic Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen submitted a proposal to the Third Plenary Session to circulate domestic rice and wheat.

(2) The Ministry of Finance is in charge of tariffs, and domestic transportation of rice and grain should be subject to transit taxes in accordance with regulations (wheat does not have this tax). Now, in order to strive for circulation and facilitate people's food, it is proposed that the government issue an order to exempt this transit tax in order to implement it thoroughly. (3) If rice and wheat are indeed lacking in a province, and after a thorough investigation and statistics, it is considered necessary to prohibit exports, a detailed explanation should be given first, and the Central Political Council should deliberate and decide. However, it should still not be used as an excuse to levy taxes under the guise of prohibition. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Important Correction: Letter from the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In yesterday's draft from our agency, "Third Plenary Session Passes Proposal to Concentrate National Strength to Save the Crisis," in the second item regarding preparations for constitutional government, the second clause "It is proposed to convene a National Congress in March of the 24th year of the Republic to resolve the constitution and decide the date of promulgation," "24th year" was mistakenly written as "22nd year." We hereby send this letter to respectfully request that you correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, December 20th.</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan Reports on Diplomacy with Japan</h3>
<p>To Resolve the Northeast Incident, the Two Most Important Principles Must Be Insisted Upon</p>
<p>Efforts Should Be Concentrated to Deal with Those Who Use Violence</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo Wengan reported to the Third Plenary Session on the 21st on the Sino-Japanese issue and diplomacy with Japan. He recounted that after the September 18th Incident, the Japanese successively occupied important cities and towns in the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and even wanted to maintain their commercial position in China by force. There was the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, and they also shelled Nanjing and Tianjin, and provoked in Qingdao and Fuzhou, so that they violated the law and humanity without repentance. Here are the major crimes: (1) Violation of the basic principles of law and humanitariansm. (2) Violation of the principles of international law. (3) Violation of the Covenant of the League of Nations. (4) Violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (5) Violation of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. (6) Violation of the resolutions of the League of Nations. (7) Violation of Japan's own covenants in the League of Nations. Wengan was ordered at a time of crisis and is the day to serve the country sincerely. He is trying to utilize and maintain all the rights and positions that our side should have through diplomatic means in order to save the crisis in one out of ten thousand. Wengan should solemnly reiterate our side's most important principles that we have always adhered to: First, any solution to the Northeast Incident must not allow the maintenance of the puppet organization in the Eastern Provinces as a prerequisite. Second, China believes that the reasonable way to resolve the Northeast Incident must be in accordance with the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and China's sovereignty, while also ensuring the permanent peace of the Far East as a necessary condition. However, judging from today's international situation, the so-called peace and fairness, and the so-called dignity of treaties, have not completely escaped the control of military force. What our country urgently needs to realize is that the current situation is by no means a simple diplomatic issue. We should concentrate the strength of the whole country, be of one heart and one mind, and use the most effective methods of resistance to deal with those who use violence. At the same time, Wengan also firmly believes that those who arbitrarily invade with military force will inevitably suffer the final failure. The historical records of ancient and modern China and foreign countries have repeatedly shown this. May our countrymen not be discouraged. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>The National Government Meeting Will Be Held After the Closing of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government Meeting has been suspended for eleven months. It is heard that the first meeting after returning to Nanjing will be held on the first morning after the closing of the Third Plenary Session. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Lin Sen Summoned the Panchen Lama to Discuss the Tibetan Issue in Detail</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin summoned the Panchen Lama again on the 21st. At 1:40 PM, Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, accompanied the Panchen Lama to the National Government. An official from the National Government's Bureau of Ceremonies was dispatched to greet them into the first reception hall. Lin came out to meet them, and the Panchen Lama bowed respectfully. They discussed the Tibetan issue in detail. The conversation was translated by an interpreter. After taking a photo in the auditorium around 2:00 PM, Lin and Shi left.

Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as a Standing Committee Member of the Central Political Council, asked Sun to take office as President of the Legislative Yuan first, and after the Third Legislative Committee is supplemented and decided, he could go to Shanghai.

<h3>Zhang Yiqiu Talks About Sino-Russian Commercial Relations</h3>
<p>In the Past, China's Trade with Russia Was a Surplus</p>
<p>In the Future, It May Become a Deficit</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yiqiu, Director of the Department of Commerce, said that after the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, commercial relations were not completely severed. Russian kerosene, cotton cloth, and timber were still related to the Chinese market. Before the restoration of diplomatic relations, Russian goods could be imported into China, but Chinese goods could not be exported to Russia. The reason for this was that Russia's foreign trade was completely monopolized by the government. All goods allowed for import and export were operated by the National Trading Company or other specially approved trading companies. Ordinary merchants could not engage in foreign trade, so their entry and exit could be manipulated by the government. With this restoration of diplomatic relations, Chinese goods can also seek sales in Russia. Our exports to Russia are mainly soybeans, and the soybean production area is the three northeastern provinces, which are no longer under our control. Tea exports to Russia may be better than they are now. Recently, Russia's industry, commerce, and agriculture have developed more than ours, especially in the industrial field, where there is a lot of production. Therefore, Russia does not welcome non-essential products. We sincerely hope that when we sign a commercial treaty with Russia in the future, we must add a large number of reciprocal products in order to seek sales in Russia. Russian goods imported into China have always been mainly kerosene, timber, ramie, and cotton cloth. Our country has no kerosene production at all, and there is also a shortage of timber. Only a small number of timbers from the three northeastern provinces are transported into the mainland, but they are all in the hands of the Japanese. The country's own production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth is still insufficient. With the supplement of Russian goods, it can reduce the market for foreign goods, and the cheap price of Russian goods can slightly ease the people's economic power. However, in the past, China's trade with Russia was a surplus, and in the future, it may become a deficit. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Gathering National Strength to Save the Nation from Peril</h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session opens. Twenty-seven committee members, including Central Committee member Sun Ke, enumerate principles and methods. They propose a case to gather national strength to save the nation from peril. This case has already been passed by the general assembly. According to newspaper reports, its principles roughly include one concerning the rectification of internal affairs and another concerning the preparation for constitutional governance. Under the principle of rectifying internal affairs, there are extremely clear decisions, such as effectively guaranteeing the people's freedoms of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief; such as the survival or abolition of political sub-committees; such as the rectification of the administrative system; such as dispatching personnel to investigate local politics and the people's hardships. Under the principle of preparing for constitutional governance, there are also very concrete indications regarding the implementation of local autonomy, the preparation for convening a national assembly, and the drafting of a constitution. The national crisis has reached this point. Survival is at stake, hanging by a thread. We must gather all our strength to jointly seek to break the current difficult situation. This is what our people across the country have been yearning for day and night for the past year but have been unable to obtain. Now, in the Third Plenary Session, which bears the heavy responsibility of leading the nation's politics, the principles for implementation have already been resolved and clearly stipulated. This kind of definite and clear indication is truly what the people of the whole country admire. However, we still have something to say. Allow us to elaborate.</p>
<p>Regarding the absolute freedom of the people to assemble, associate, speak, publish, reside, and believe, there are extremely clear stipulations in the Kuomintang party platform, in the Provisional Constitution passed by the National Assembly last year, and in other government declarations and laws. However, the legal codes are magnificent, recording such things, but the people are still suffering as before. To this day, the people not only still do not have freedoms of assembly, association, speech, and belief, but even individual lives are often determined by the joys, angers, loves, and hates of important figures, without any guarantee whatsoever. Orders come from multiple sources. Legal codes are numerous. Here, it is a merit, and there, it is a cardinal sin. What constitutes merit or crime is completely undefined. This kind of phenomenon must absolutely not be allowed to continue. Therefore, we express great joy at the resolution of this conference. But we especially hope that this resolution can be earnestly implemented, and not merely become a historical document. For resolving without acting is no different from not resolving at all, and it also fails to demonstrate the government's great credibility. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, the establishment of political sub-committees was essentially a disguised form of separatism. Under the principle of "strengthening the central government and consolidating the central government," there is no doubt that this kind of system should be thoroughly abolished. However, the formation of a situation of division and separatism must have other root causes, and is not merely due to the form of political sub-committees. The form of political sub-committees can be abolished, but the substance of separatism does not necessarily disappear as a result. Therefore, today, we must examine where the root causes lie, and then launch the "real strength" to eradicate the root causes. Then, once the "resolution" is "decided," the "decision" can be "acted upon." This is the second point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, dispatching personnel to investigate politics and inquire about the hardships of the people is certainly well-intentioned, but it is still just a peripheral measure. Today, foreign aggression is increasingly urgent, internal strife is rampant, the fields are filled with starving corpses, and the roads are filled with refugees. This is a reflection of the gains and losses of politics, and a depiction of the people's hardships. Now that the government has the determination to reform politics and alleviate the people's hardships, then given the current scene of devastation and crisis, it should immediately prioritize the interests of the people. Government authorities should be able to instruct officials at all levels with this purpose, and officials at all levels should be able to follow the order and implement it. Politics can naturally step onto the right track. One would still fear that they cannot earnestly follow the order and implement it. Only then can dispatching personnel to investigate verify the results and reward or punish accordingly. In this way, the investigation will be more practical. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation of constitutional governance has long been a unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. But we especially hope that the formulation of the constitution will be based on genuine public opinion. Only then can the implementation of constitutional governance truly be an exercise of the people's rights. If it cannot, then the same mistakes as the constitutionalism of the first year of the Republic will be a lesson from the past. A difference of a hair's breadth can lead to a loss of a thousand miles. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>In summary, we wholeheartedly agree in principle with the resolution of the conference to gather national strength to save the nation from peril. But how can "strength" be "gathered"? What kind of "strength" is "gathered"? And what kind of "strength" is necessary to "save the nation"? We especially hope that the conference will conduct further discussions. Furthermore, we have heard that governance does not lie in much talk, but in "action." But it is necessary to make what is said manifest in facts. Then, politics can naturally generate great power and naturally win the support of the people. Italy and the Soviet Union are all practical examples before us. This is what we dare to earnestly hope that the conference will carefully consider.</p>

<h3>Chen Cheng Orders Various Divisions to Rush to Build the Jiangxi-Fujian Highway</h3>

<p>(Nanchang) After Chen Cheng moved from Ji'an to Fuzhou, he ordered the 27th, 77th, and other divisions to rush to build the Jiangxi-Fujian Highway, which passes through Fuzhou City and crosses the Fu River. The Provincial Government immediately began work on the Jiangxi-Hunan Road to Wanzai, and telegraphed He [Jian] in Hunan to quickly build a connecting road from Liuyang, in accordance with the resolutions of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Conference.

(21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chen Jitang telegraphed Xiong Shihui in Jiangxi, saying that transporting Jiangxi rice to Guangdong would not only regulate the economy and food supply of the two provinces, but would also benefit the suppression of bandits and the people's livelihood. He hoped that it would be transported to Guangdong continuously. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Liaoning Case is Postponed for Resolution; League of Nations and China and Japan Issue Declarations</h3>
<p>=China= The Draft is Evasive and Disappointing</p>
<p>=Japan= Repeatedly Insists on Protecting Vested Rights</p>
<p>=League of Nations= Mediation is Difficult, but Sincerity is Not Completely Exhausted</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Information Office of the Chinese Delegation issued a notice explaining that the Chinese government believes that the first draft resolution of the Committee of Nineteen is disappointing for the following reasons: ㈠ The resolution did not declare opposition to "Manchukuo" nor did it state that Japan violated the League of Nations Covenant and other international treaties. ㈡ The resolution did not include arbitration methods, nor did it include the important explanations of the Lytton Report. ㈢ Although the resolution mentions Chapter Ten of the Lytton Report, it is completely inappropriate and will inevitably encounter fierce resistance from the Chinese people. ㈣ The resolution does not specify the dates requested by China. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese Delegation issued a statement to the press tonight, expressing its admiration for the Committee of Nineteen's resolution to seek a constructive solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. It also stated that the Japanese Delegation believes that its duty lies in sincerely striving to ensure that the work undertaken in Geneva achieves a successful conclusion in a way that both protects Japan's rights and affirms peace in the Far East and consolidates the League of Nations' cause. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, Foreign Minister Hymans of Belgium, was absent and was replaced by Swiss representative Huber. He recently issued the following statement: First, the Sino-Japanese problem involves substantive difficulties on the one hand, and takes a considerable amount of time due to the exchange of telegrams on the other, so its negotiations will take a considerable amount of time. This is unavoidable. The Sino-Japanese dispute has been going on for a long time, and one of the parties has requested that the date to which the covenant stipulates be extended be specified. The Committee is deeply aware of the need to resolve this matter quickly, but because this matter is of great importance, the various issues it raises involve the entirety of the issue of world cooperation, and the new system of international relations is currently in progress and is also affected by these issues. Therefore, the Committee must deal with it with extreme perseverance and cannot rush to a conclusion before exhausting its mediation efforts. The resolution drafted by the Committee is generally acceptable to both parties. Although there are currently wide differences of opinion, they are not irreconcilable if dealt with sincerely. In order to avoid failure and the impact of failure, mediation and negotiation are necessary measures. Therefore, the Committee of Nineteen has decided to allow the necessary time to conduct talks with the countries concerned and to allow the governments of all countries to participate in order to seek a solution. The next meeting will be held no later than January 16. The Committee believes that both parties will be able to show concessions during this period. Otherwise, mediation will be impossible.

<h3>Ambassador Yan Remains in Geneva to Preside</h3>
<p>Ambassadors Gu and Guo Return to Their Original Posts</p>
<p>If Japan Does Not Change its Attitude, Reconciliation is Hopeless</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news: The Committee of Nineteen has already closed and will reconvene on January 16 next year. During this period, it will continue to mediate in order to bring the opinions of both parties closer together. But if [Japan] does not abandon its policy of aggression, reconciliation will ultimately be ineffective, as we swear to fight to the death to not recognize the puppet organization. It is expected that the meeting will not have any effect when it is reconvened next year. Our representatives Gu and Guo will return to their respective posts in Britain and the United States. Ambassador Yan will remain in Geneva to preside over everything. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Youths Send Blood Letters</h3>
<p>Believe that the Future of the Nation is Hopeful</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Boastful Words</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Geneva dispatch: After the Committee of Nineteen adjourned, Representative Matsuoka told people that it was regrettable that the Manchurian problem was still unresolved as the New Year approached. However, it is also a good way to re-examine this issue with a calm spirit next spring. The real battle is yet to come. The Japanese people must know that the complete resolution of the Manchurian incident will take at least several years, and they must proceed towards the desired goal with a united and cohesive determination. The diplomatic war will also take two or three years. Moreover, there are many important outstanding issues piled up like a mountain in the future. The people must never be complacent and optimistic. What I am most grateful for recently is the dozens of middle school students' blood-written letters. Only when the people have this enthusiasm can national prestige be promoted.

<h3>Su Bingwen's Former Troops in Russia are Suffering Due to Lack of Supplies</h3>
<p>Karakhan Requests that Our Government Provide Assistance</p>
<p>Su Himself Remains in Moscow</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government bulletin "Izvestia" stated that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan recently met with Chinese representative Wang Zengsi to discuss ways to deal with the troops of Su Bingwen's former subordinates who remained in Russian territory. Karakhan told Representative Wang that there were 2,890 soldiers of Su's troops who had entered Russian territory, and 1,200 civilians, including 347 women and 206 children. The Soviet government has allowed them to leave the country, but they are trapped by economic difficulties, having neither the travel expenses to return home nor the means to live. The Soviet government feels that it cannot bear the travel expenses or long-term supplies for these people, so it hopes that China will provide the necessary assistance. Before this method is resolved, they will temporarily remain in Tomsk. Representative Wang promised to report this to the Chinese government immediately. (20th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) When Su Bingwen's troops retreated last month, a total of 4,090 Chinese soldiers and civilians retreated into Russian territory, including 1,200 civilians, of whom 347 were women and 306 were children. According to Russian newspapers, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan has today discussed the method of dealing with the situation with Secretary-General Wang of the Sino-Russian Conference. Karakhan believes that these people are poor and that the Russian government cannot sell them out of the country or maintain their supplies for free. He hopes that the Chinese government will quickly find a way to transport them back to their country. For the time being, these people will be left in the territory of Tomsk. Secretary-General Wang promised to report to the government immediately. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Su Bingwen's secretary-general, He Shengda, telegraphed from Beijing on the 18th, stating that after Su and others arrived in Moscow, they met with Shi Lin and other important figures. They plan to stay in Moscow for one week to travel and give lectures in various cities. They will not leave Russia until Mo Dehui returns to Moscow. All newspapers have written extremely respectful editorials on Su. A welcome party was held in Moscow on the 17th, with 20,000 people participating. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Su Bingwen's son, Zongjun, said that in this recent general offensive by the Japanese army in northern Manchuria, the great battle lasted seven days and nights. The casualties of the National Salvation Army reached four to five thousand people. The battle was fierce, no less than the Shanghai Battle. The area is remote, traffic is obstructed, and news is not timely. For more than two months from September 27, there was very little domestic assistance. After his father returns to China and negotiates a proper agreement, he will definitely reorganize his forces and continue to resist Japan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Telegraphes Yan, Gu, and Guo</h3>
<p>Hoping to Strive According to the Covenant</p>
<p>If the Japanese Side is Unreasonably Tyrannical</p>
<p>There is Only a National Mobilization</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang telegraphed Luo [Wen'gan], Minister of Foreign Affairs, and forwarded to Envoys Yan [Huiqing], Gu [Weijun], and Guo [Taiqi] on the 21st: "Japan took advantage of our unpreparedness, occupied our Northeast with violence, and forcibly kidnapped the deposed emperor Puyi to organize a puppet government, attempting to repeat the old tricks of annexing Korea and destroying our country. The facts of its displaying of power without revealing justice, its disregard for the League of Nations, and its destruction of world peace are obvious. People around the world do not know this. Recently, with exhausted arguments, it used despicable means at the League of Nations General Assembly to falsely accuse our country of being an disunified nation, hoping to shift the world's attention and cover up its crimes. Its intentions are sinister and hateful. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to actively prepare for war, we are also actively preparing for mobilization at any time. I hope that you will negotiate and preside over the discussions, uphold justice based on the League of Nations Covenant, and not stop until the goal of recovering lost territory is achieved. If they are unreasonably tyrannical, then we can only mobilize the whole country to fight to the death. Although the ox is thin, it is still angry with the pig. We are not afraid of death. The telegram is full of grief and indignation. I cannot express it all." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Cemetery for Martyrs Who Died Resisting Japan Adopts a Representative System for Burial</h3>
<p>128 People Selected</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Cemetery Committee for Martyrs Who Died Resisting Japan has located the address of the cemetery at the foot of Zijin Mountain, east of Linggu Temple and west of Tan's Tomb, in front of the Memorial Hall. Because the address is narrow, it was decided to adopt a representative system for burial, using a lottery method. After the lottery, 70 people from the 19th Route Army, 58 people from the 5th Army, the Gendarmerie, the Volunteer Army, etc., a total of 128 people, were selected, as a commemoration of the eternally remembered January 28th Shanghai Incident.

After they are found, they will be transported to Nanjing and buried on a selected date. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Zhi Chong Telegraphes Requesting Prompt Dispatch of He Jiwu to Guizhou</h3>
<p>To Concurrently Serve as Chairman</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Zhi Chong, Commander of Bandit Suppression in the Hunan-Guizhou Border Region, telegraphed Chairman Lin, Chairman Jiang, President Song, and Minister He, stating that the upheavals in Guizhou stemmed from military and civilian rule, with those with military status vying for power. Since the reform of Guizhou's provincial administration, political crises have occurred frequently. Now, the 25th Army is continuing the tradition of military rule, resulting in infighting and internal strife. Now that Chairman Wang has left the province due to certain matters, and all the department heads have closed their doors, the political center is suspended and masterless. The people of Guizhou are extremely anxious. I earnestly request that He Jiwu be promptly dispatched to take office and concurrently serve as Chairman, so that Guizhou's administration is not interrupted and disputes are prevented. If Committee Member He travels to Guizhou from Hunan, I, Zhi Chong, will do my best to protect him and support the implementation of the Central Government's orders to the end. Whether this is appropriate is up to your discretion. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Mao Guangxiang occupied Guiyang, he telegraphed the Central Government one after another, expressing his extreme support. He asked the Central Government to command him to take full responsibility for settling the Guizhou situation. A certain important figure had telegraphed that Chun [Yunfeng] was approved to exercise the powers of the Commander-in-Chief. The telegram did not explicitly order him to preside over the Guizhou administration. The news reported in the Hunan telegram that Jiang had telegraphed Mao to preside over the Guizhou administration is not true. (21st Dispatch)</p>

Japanese planes scouted and bombed from the air, causing heavy casualties on both sides. The Volunteer Army has built solid positions in the Niaojiwutai area northeast of Kailu. A fierce battle will soon take place. The Volunteer Army on the border of Rehe adopts a strategy of decentralization and guerrilla warfare, specializing in harassing the Japanese army and hindering its plan to attack Rehe. Representatives of various detachments of the Volunteer Army have been holding an important meeting in a certain place in Hala for several days to discuss this issue.

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Issues a General Order to Promote the Establishment of Rural Credit Cooperatives</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry, in view of the economic decline in rural areas and the urgent need for relief, has issued a general order to all provinces, ordering local areas to cooperate with merchants to establish rural credit cooperatives to circulate rural finance. Because farmers rely on farming for a living and must go through a period of more than half a year before they can harvest, short-term loans are still difficult to meet their needs. Ordinary banks and money shops in various places mostly focus on short-term loans, which are difficult to suit farmers' loans. Therefore, it has been decided that the state will handle large-scale farmers' banks to establish branches in various provinces, and rural credit cooperatives will be established in various counties. The principles have been decided and are currently being prepared with the relevant parties. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A New Fascist Party Appears in Japan, Named the National League, with Adachi and Nakano as Leaders, Advocating East Asian Monroe Doctrine and Economic Merger of Japan and Manchuria</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - The trend of hostility towards existing political parties in Japan is growing daily. In recent months, political groups resembling "棒喝" (a Zen term implying sudden awakening) have sprung up one after another. The most important of these is the group initiated by the former Minister of Home Affairs, Adachi. Adachi left the Minseito Party and established the National Policy Research Society, with Nakano, who possesses leadership abilities, as his assistant. With the goal of upholding the existing parliamentary system but eliminating the existing bad habits of political parties, it has gained many supporters since its establishment. It has been decided to hold the founding ceremony of the new political party tomorrow, with 8,000 representatives from various places participating. The new political party will be named the National League. Its political platform includes the Far Eastern Monroe Doctrine and the economic merger of Japan and Manchuria. It also advocates major reforms in matters such as taxes, finance, education, and diplomacy. At the time of the new party's establishment, its strength in the Diet has already reached 33 votes, and the populist Diet member Matsutani has officially switched allegiance to the new party today. The National League is an organization of a Fascist nature, so members plan to use black shirts as part of their uniforms. Today, Nakano told reporters that this party especially welcomes young people from all over the country. He estimates that no less than two million people support this party and expects the number of members to increase rapidly after its official establishment.</p>

The New York Times also stated that Roosevelt plans to issue an order after taking office as president on March 4, instructing Owen Young, known for the Young Plan, and economic expert Bernard Baruch to re-engage in the study of the war debt issue.</p>

<p>210,000 Registered Prostitutes</p>
<p>Over 22 Million Customers</p>
<p>Secret Prostitution Not Included</p>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency - According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, in 1931, the total number of prostitutes nationwide (in the Japanese mainland) was 210,681, and the number of customers was 22,239,641.

<p>Officially Recognized by Congress</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Santiago, 20th - Chile's newly elected President, Alessandri, was declared President of Chile by Congress today.

However, although Alessandri maintained his presidential seat with machine guns, considering Chile's current food shortages and the sharp decline in paper currency, all parties recognize that future governance will also be very difficult.</p>

<p>▲Den-tsu, Tokyo, 20th - Yumoto, an official from the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, went to Dalian to conduct an on-site investigation of exchange speculation and has recently returned to Tokyo.

<h3>Government Hires German Engineers to Dredge the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Technical Experiments Conducted on the Shores of Lake Walchensee</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, 21st - The evening newspaper reports that the waters of the Yellow River in China have historically caused disasters due to frequent flooding. The Chinese government has now decided to entrust the responsibility of dredging the Yellow River to German engineers. The Sengcheng Institute for Hydraulic Research has recently conducted technical experiments near Lake Walchensee in the Bavarian Alps for this matter. The method involves excavating a waterway to simulate the flow of the Yellow River, and placing cohesive sandy soil in the waterway, with a composition roughly equivalent to the alluvial soil contained in the Yellow River, to study the expansion and contraction of alluvial soil in the Yellow River. After the results of this experiment are obtained, a committee consisting of several engineers will be sent to China to conduct on-site surveys.</p>

<h3>Northeast Problem and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>While Chinese public opinion generally hopes that certain political privileges will be returned to China to match the dignity of Chinese national sovereignty, any intelligent Chinese person would never advocate for methods other than the internationally recognized methods of negotiation and agreement to achieve their goals. Sometimes, one might see a slogan or two on street corners, or hear a speech or two in school auditoriums, criticizing the existing basis of Sino-foreign relations. However, such slogans and speeches cannot represent the cautious attitude of the entire nation, just as the communist newspapers of Western countries do not represent the general opinion of those countries. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, advocated nationalism as one of the Three Principles of the People. Its nature is entirely self-defensive, peaceful, and constructive. This nationalism is the result of China's experience after interacting with various countries in the world and represents a kind of national aspiration to seek China's liberation from unequal treaties in order to achieve an equal position with other countries in the world. Therefore, its nature is purely self-defensive and peaceful. At the same time, this nationalism is also constructive. Why? Because its ultimate goal is to achieve a world commonwealth through the path of nationalism. China hopes to gradually progress and become a strong and prosperous country, so that it can contribute to world peace and happiness. It deeply understands that the final step in the progress of all countries in the world will eventually become a "nation-state," joining together in a state of great harmony. This highest political view has often been found in the words of ancient Chinese sages, Confucius being one of them. Dr. Sun Yat-sen further developed and expanded on its meaning, making it a major point in the Kuomintang's doctrine and policy. However, the Chinese people unanimously oppose Japan's traditional policy of controlling and overcoming China. With each conflict in Sino-Japanese relations, Japan's traditional policy becomes clearer, and its ability to endanger China's security and survival becomes more and more certain. The Chinese people view the current incident in the three northeastern provinces not as a local event, but as one aspect of Japan's entire continental policy. Well said are the words in the report on page 23:</p>
<p>"In recent years, Japan's demands have been regarded in China as a serious provocation to China's national aspirations, even more so than all the rights claimed by the powers."</p>
<p>The Chinese people's concept is not out of fear, but out of experience and knowledge gained over the past decades. As for other countries, China has absolutely no xenophobic intentions. From the government down to the people, all sincerely hope for the consolidation of friendly relations between China and foreign countries for mutual benefit. Regarding this point, there is no need for me to say more. Now I will only cite some figures as proof. Currently, there are 360,000 foreigners working and living peacefully in China. There are 8,200 foreign firms. Among the foreigners, there are 7,567 missionaries preaching in various parts of China without difficulty or danger. Occasional incidents are exceptions. Even many Japanese residents in China, even during this period of tense Sino-Japanese sentiment, are still able to live and work in peace under the protection of the Chinese government, with very few unexpected incidents occurring. One more thing can prove this: many Chinese state-owned enterprises employ a large number of foreign personnel. In the various ministries of the central government, there are more than 40 experts from eight countries assisting in all administrative matters, and the number is expected to increase further. The report also mentioned this point, saying:</p>
<p>"The National Government has recently sought and accepted international assistance in solving various problems in China, such as financial matters since 1930, and the liaison with League of Nations specialized agencies to handle economic planning and development since the establishment of the National Economic Committee in 1931, as well as flood relief work in the same year, etc."</p>
<p>Recently, the National Government invited the League of Nations to mediate and hired many experts to come to China to study issues such as education, hygiene, river dredging, agriculture, and sericulture. If China had any hostility towards foreign countries, such cooperation projects would not have been so successful. The criticisms made by the Japanese side against China are obviously aimed at confusing public opinion and concealing the real problem. I have already pointed out the impropriety of all its more important points. The real threat to peace in the Far East is Japan's continental policy, as mentioned above. So, what are the most important facts regarding this case that have been clarified in the report? Let me tell you. Japan has put forward many exaggerated demands in its explanation of the September 18th Incident and its subsequent actions. The Chinese government is very interested in revealing the details of the investigation report. Japan claimed that there were as many as 300 outstanding issues between China and Japan and that Japan took military action in order to resolve these outstanding issues satisfactorily. However, the report on page 66 of the investigation team states:</p>
<p>"However, the so-called 300 pending cases between the two countries, and the exhaustion of peaceful means by one party to resolve these cases, have not been substantiated."</p>
<p>The report also stated, "Therefore, the saying that all outstanding issues should be resolved by force when necessary has become a common slogan." It also stated, "All decisions to resolve by force, meetings of the General Staff Headquarters of the Army Ministry to discuss military plans, and the definite instructions issued to Commander of the Kwantung Army and Colonel Doihara, who was stationed in Fengtian and summoned to Tokyo in early September to advocate resolving all outstanding issues by force as soon as possible, were freely cited in various newspapers. Reading the records of feelings about these aspects and other organizations in various newspapers, one can know that the situation is becoming dangerously tense." Page 66 of the report also pointed out the Japanese Minister of the Army's fierce speech in Tokyo, advocating that the Japanese army in Manchuria take direct action, and pointed out the provocative acts of night exercises and occasional fire by the Japanese army in Shenyang. Finally, it mentioned the September 18th Incident, which, according to the report, was "the first step in the military occupation of Manchuria." From this, it can be seen that the fuse of the current Sino-Japanese dispute is not the unresolved outstanding issues between one country and another, but the interventionist acts of the Japanese military authorities. Also, regarding Sino-Japanese outstanding issues, the investigation team has already stated in its report that its nature can be resolved by arbitration or legal methods. Therefore, was Japan's military action on September 18th and 19th, 1931, really a self-defense action as Japan claimed? The answer to this question is of the utmost importance not only to China but also to the League of Nations, because this point is closely related to the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. Japan claimed that the Japanese army's invasion of Manchuria was a self-defense action, but the investigation team disagreed with Japan's statement, saying:</p>
<p>"It is undeniable that the emotions between the Chinese and Japanese armies were high. This investigation team has obtained evidence that the Japanese side had indeed made full preparations in advance to deal with any possible war between China. This plan was put into practice on the night of September 18th to 19th, quickly and accurately. The Chinese side obeyed the instructions of their superiors (see page 69). They were neither prepared to attack the Japanese army, nor did they have a plan to harm the lives and property of the Japanese at that time or in that place. They did not concentrate on fighting against the Japanese army, nor were they ordered to fire. Therefore, they were surprised by the Japanese army's attack and its subsequent actions."</p>
<p>The Japanese side claimed that at about 10 p.m. on the evening of September 18th, the Chinese army blew up the South Manchurian Railway tracks near Shenyang. The Japanese side fabricated this excuse in order to use it as a fuse for its military plans. The report said, (to be continued)</p>

<p>Four Poisonous and Vicious Documents</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Japan's ambition to annex the Northeast was not limited to the organization of "Manchukuo." It also wanted to replicate the same method in Mongolia. In recent years, a large number of Japanese ronin and sergeants have been sneaking into Mongolian banners to carry out activities. Their purpose is nothing more than to collude with two scoundrels to be their puppets, in order to realize their plan to sweep across Manchuria and Mongolia. Fortunately, heaven took away their souls, and the Matsui Incident was exposed, so the plan did not succeed. I will now describe the whole story in detail to the people of the country. However, due to road obstructions, it is not easy to send letters, and if you are not careful, disaster will come without delay. Now, with the convenience of my friend Mr. Lin going south, I have hastily written this article and entrusted it to him. I sincerely hope that it can be revealed to the whole country and the world to expose its secrets. (In the documents, incomprehensible words are recorded in the original text to preserve their authenticity.)</p>
<p>Colonel Matsui Shot Dead: Since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, the Japanese warlords' traditional policy of swallowing China has been actively exposed. I still remember that in March of this year, there was a so-called Mongol bandit rebellion. At that time, 5,000 Mongolian Independent Army soldiers harassed places such as Tongliao and Xining Kailu. At first, the outside world thought it was just the usual trick of Mongol bandits disturbing the border. Later, the Rehe Army worked hard to disperse them. In the chaotic army, the body of a Japanese military officer was found. After examining his pockets and verifying his badge, it was found that he was Colonel Matsui Hirozou, who had been lurking in Inner and Outer Mongolia for more than ten years under the command of the Japanese military. More documents of Japan's great conspiracy were found among the captured Mongol bandits and disguised prisoners. It turns out that in addition to creating the fake Manchukuo, Japan also has a so-called "Great Source" country, including all of Inner and Outer Mongolia, south to the Great Wall, north to Siberia, east to the fake state of Manchuria, and west to Xinjiang. It also wants to make the two fake republics of Great Source and Great Harmony (i.e., Manchukuo) cooperate with each other, so that the northeast and northwest of our country will fall into the hands of foreign tribes. The people of the country should pay close attention to this plan.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia's Declaration of Autonomy: Among the conspiratorial documents discovered at that time, there was an Inner Mongolia Declaration of Autonomy. The original text is recorded as follows: "Mongolia is a basic nation in Asia. Its origin dates back to prehistoric times. For generations, it has been independent and dominant in Asia. Until the rise of the Yuan Dynasty, it unified Europe and Asia, connecting Eastern and Western cultures, promoting material civilization, and building an unprecedented great cause. Its great history has long shocked the world. But today, it has suffered a setback and has become a very weak nation. Thinking of this, not only the ambitious people of Inner Mongolia cry bitterly, but also enthusiastic people from all countries are overjoyed and want to speak out for injustice. The biggest reasons why Inner Mongolia has come to this are two: the trampling of the Manchus and</p>
<p>The devastation of China. When the Manchus unified China, they divided Inner Mongolia into several leagues and banners, turning the entire political economy into a piecemeal political economy. The entire Inner Mongolia was divided into scattered Inner Mongolia, destroying the unified situation and replacing it with multi-headed politics. They added to its name but emptied its power, sealed its titles but seized its rights. The trick of fooling and the sinister tactics turned the innocent Inner Mongolia into a numb and indifferent one. Since the Republic of China, it has intensified, implementing a strategy of extermination in the beautiful name of republic, using the high-sounding tone of five ethnic groups as compatriots, and using the policy of assimilation. The magpie occupies the dove's nest, and the guest overpowers the host. The league and banner signboards have been changed to provinces and counties, and sacred temples have mostly become military camps. Reclamation and immigration, extortion and extortion, nothing is spared. The suffering of our Mongolian people today is even worse than that of black slaves and red races, and even worse than cattle and horses. If this continues, what can we imagine? This is why the martyrs of Inner Mongolia have risen one after another, one after another, and fought to this day. This army inherits the hot blood of the martyrs and righteous men, remembers the suffering of the nation, reverses the tide, supports the building that is about to collapse, and recovers the lost political power. The purpose is to completely realize the autonomy of Inner Mongolia. This will not only win the approval of the good compatriots of China, but also be praised and understood by the sages and wise men of all countries. Moreover, modern human beings are becoming more and more civilized, and freedom is increasing day by day. No matter what country, they are all carrying out autonomy and self-determination, enjoying the happiness that human beings should have. However, Inner Mongolia is dark and without sunshine, and it is suffering from inhuman devastation. It is not only incompatible with humanity, but also hinders evolution. This is why the people of Inner Mongolia have risen up to fight, to overthrow the magic law of mankind, and to advocate the spirit of world autonomy and self-determination. Therefore, the responsibility of this army is the responsibility of liberating the Mongolian nation, and it is also the success of the part of human coexistence and co-prosperity. I deeply hope that the young and old of the Inner Mongolian nation will rise up together, follow this army, and work together to fulfill their responsibilities. Sages and wise men of all countries who advocate humanity should jointly support it.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Great Source Country: The second of the conspiratorial documents is the "Temporary Constitution for the Construction of the Great Source Republic." Its text is as follows: 1. Inner Mongolia wants to seek peace, so there is the formulation of a temporary security agreement. All banners must cooperate and abide by it. 2. The sovereignty of each banner in Inner Mongolia belongs to the banner chief or all the people within it. 3. Because of the temporarily acquired political power, each banner in Inner Mongolia should set up a league parliament, which is considered the highest legislative body.

<h3>Inspection Record of Suppressing Communists and Recovering Various Areas</h3>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The Situation Around Jianli</p>
<p>Jianli is the hometown of Wu Zixu. It faces the Yangtze River to the south, connects to Qianjiang to the north, borders Jiangling to the west, and is adjacent to the communist den of Honghu to the east. The southeast, northwest, and various regions of the county have all been communist-ized. The city was also once captured in September of the 19th year, and although it was recovered in a few months, it had been greatly damaged and recovery was not easy. Xinguizui, which belongs to it, was once the location of the Soviet of the pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-West Province of the communists, and Zhuhe was equipped with the Jianli County Soviet. The importance of its position is evident. The county was extremely brutally trampled by bandits, and one-third of the county's population was killed, especially in areas such as Fenyan and Chenhuang. As for the destruction of commercial markets and rural villages, it is even more unspeakable. Zhuhe and Xingu are both extremely large towns. After the bandit rebellion, the streets of Zhuhe were almost completely burned down, and only a few small stalls remain in Xingu today. The prosperous scene of the past can no longer be seen. The county has a total of more than 970,000 mu of farmland. After the bandit disaster and flood disaster, there are less than 920,000. Farmers have died, been injured, and fled, and the number cannot be counted. Fortunately, those who have managed to survive have no ability to cultivate, so only three-tenths of the remaining more than 900,000 mu of farmland have been cultivated, and seven-tenths of the barren land have been occupied. Farmers lack food, some use grass roots and bark to fill their hunger, and some eat water chestnuts and horse chestnuts. They are starving and freezing, and they are extremely distressed. Those who fled outside have gradually returned after the bandit area was recovered, but because of the lack of food, they cannot survive, and recently they have mostly left their hometowns to escape the famine. The emergency relief for the bandit area released by the Hubei Provincial Government has only received more than 3,000 yuan in Jianli. As a result of the distribution, each adult received only two mao, and each child received only one mao and a few cents. A family of five totaled less than one yuan. How could a cup of water help a cartload of firewood? The authorities must pay attention to it. At present, the organization of the security team and the volunteer team has begun to take shape. The security team is reorganized from the people's group with guns, and there are about 400 people. The volunteer team is organized by the strong men of the whole county, with a total of 176 large teams and more than 30,000 people. They are scattered in various villages, and training is not easy. In terms of military equipment, there are only spears and broadswords, and no guns. The Baojia system is currently being promoted. Each district has been budgeted and is sending people to compile and investigate. Before the bandit disaster, education in the county was not developed, and now it has completely gone bankrupt. There is still something to be done for reorganization and revitalization. The reporter arrived in Jianli with the inspection team at 8:00 am on the 13th. Due to the rush of time, they only stayed for about an hour before boarding the boat to Xindi. However, during this shortest time of inspection, witnessing the destruction of the towns and the suffering of the disaster victims, I felt shocked and could not help but sigh. On the way from Shashi to Jianli, on the night of the 12th, I stayed overnight in Tiaoxian, which belongs to Shishou County. The town is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River and is the main road for the communist bandits of Honghu to enter Hunan. It has been trampled by bandits several times, and the traces of destruction are everywhere. There is now a Xiang army stationed there. According to the locals, there are bandits lurking a dozen miles away from the town, and it remains to be cleared. (Sent from Xindi on December 15)</p>
<h3>Record of the Inauguration of the New Fujian Provincial Committee</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai has also arrived at the Pacification Headquarters to assume his duties</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The order for the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government was received by telegram from the Office of the Civil Secretary of the National Government on the 12th and reached Fujian. The provincial government immediately instructed all departments to expedite the closing of affairs to facilitate the handover. By the 14th, all departments had completed the handover procedures and the provincial government notified the newly appointed Chairman Jiang Guangnai to schedule the takeover. On the 15th, Jiang sent Mai Qian, Secretary of the Pacification Headquarters, to the provincial government to announce that the new committee members would arrive at the government office at 10:00 AM on the 16th to take their oath of office. On the 16th, merchants and residents throughout the city hung flags to celebrate. Around 9:00 AM, Jiang Guangnai, along with Li Zhangda, Fan Qiwu, Sun Xiwu, Lu Wenlan, and Lin Zhiyuan - five people in total (Zheng Zhenwen, Gao Dengting, and Li Qingquan had not yet arrived) - arrived at the provincial government in cars from the Pacification Headquarters. They were greeted by Guo Shihui, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, along with the heads of various sections. At 10:00 AM, the oath of office ceremony was held. Zhan Yuan, sent by the Central Government, served as the oath supervisor, and Wei Datong, sent by the National Government, announced the order. Many guests from various circles attended the ceremony. The ceremony concluded around 11:00 AM. Li Zhangda immediately went to the Secretariat, Fan Qiwu to the Finance Department, and Sun Xiwu to the Construction Department. Jiang Guangnai sent Qiu Yu to the Civil Affairs Department to take over their respective responsibilities, and announced the appointment of section chiefs, secretaries, and other important officials. From the provincial government side, there were Guo Le (former Secretary-General of the Provincial Government), Wang Hanqing (advisor), Yin Gongwu, Chen Zhonghe, and Lin Chi (former secretaries of the Provincial Government), Zhang Jingtang (former head of the Second Section of the Provincial Government) as the head of the First Section, Mai Qian as the head of the Second Section, Guo Boxiang as the head of the Third Section, and Jiang Yanken as the head of the Fourth Section. The new provincial government has scheduled to begin operations on the 17th and hold the first meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. It is heard that the Finance Department will first allocate one month's worth of funding to various agencies within one or two days to the Education Department, as the new director Zheng Zhenwen only arrived in Fujian from Shanghai on the Hua'an steamer on the 16th and is expected to take office on the 19th. However, the current Director, Cheng Shi, sealed the seals and handed them over to the provincial government on the evening of the 15th, ceasing operations and awaiting the takeover.</p>
<p>With the new Provincial Committee having taken office, the former Director of the Pacification Headquarters, Jiang Guangnai, has now been transferred to the position of Provincial Chairman. The Central Government has appointed Cai Tingkai to take over as the Director of the Pacification Headquarters. Cai arrived in Fuzhou by plane a few days ago and, after consulting with Jiang Guangnai and being urged by various parties, assumed his duties at the Pacification Headquarters on the 15th. He will schedule his oath of office at a later date. Cai has also formulated a plan to streamline the organization within the Pacification Headquarters and, in consultation with Jiang, has largely finalized issues such as personnel retention and expense reduction. It is expected that these measures will be gradually implemented in the coming days. (December 17th)</p>
<h3>The Bankruptcy Case of Songjiang Bank</h3>
<p>Peculiar Judgment by the County Court</p>
<p>Creditors Decide to Appeal</p>
<p>Songjiang Bank was founded in the first year of the Republic. In the 17th year, the president, Xie Zaiping, died of illness. His son, Xie Liangda, was appointed as president. The bank was not registered, but the organization adopted a corporate system. Therefore, the president, directors, and supervisors were all elected by the shareholders' meeting and were important officials in charge of business operations. At the end of January of this year, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the market was closed. On February 5th, when the Shanghai branch went bankrupt, the president and supervisors withdrew six or seventy thousand yuan from the head office's inventory of over eighty thousand yuan. On the last page of the bank's cash flow book, it was recorded that the head office also ceased operations on the 10th, and the president fled without a trace. The total amount of overdue public and private deposits was over six hundred thousand yuan, posing a threat to the social financial system. The bank's directors petitioned the Songjiang County Government to organize a liquidation committee, which was composed of the original supervisors as liquidation committee members. The first meeting was held on February 23rd. On the 17th, over eleven thousand yuan of the inventory was paid back to Lu Jiji and other accounts. The creditors, therefore, distrusted the committee and filed civil and criminal lawsuits with the county court, as well as a request for evidence preservation. The court president, Wang, ordered officials to seal up the bank. The County Magistrate Shen repeatedly refused under the pretext of liquidation. By mid-April, the provincial government ordered the transfer of the bank's evidence to the court for handling. The court president, Wang, selected two accountants, Xi Yushu and Xia Sunhuan, to conduct the liquidation. In early August, one-tenth of the deposits were repaid, and evidence of destruction was discovered, such as cash receipts, cash payment receipts, transfer account receipts, remittance books, stub books, and inventory lists. Concealed assets such as bond coupons and provincial government bonds, railway stocks, etc., totaled over twenty thousand yuan, which flowed out of the bank's accounts. During the market closure on February 5th of this year, the total number of revenue and expenses reached more than 600,000 yuan, which is especially alarming. Furthermore, the handwriting and ink marks on the latest draft flow books are consistent throughout, without any discrepancies, which also raises suspicions. The civil suit portion of the case has been accepted and has been heard six times by October. In the fourth summons, 115 plaintiff creditors were summoned. In the fifth summons, due to the death of the defendant Zhang Shengshan, the court ordered the correction of the lawsuit. The legal heirs of Zhang Shengshan, Zhang Jitai and Zhang Jixiang, appointed lawyer Sha Xunyi as their agent. The final hearing was held on the sixth day, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on December 12. On that day, the civil division publicly announced the main text of the case of Wu Boyang and 110 others versus Zhang Shengshan and others regarding deposit disputes. The plaintiff's request to withdraw the suit against the defendant Zhu Hesheng Gu Jiaxuan should be approved, and the rest should be considered withdrawn. The plaintiffs are responsible for the cost of litigation. Upon reading the document, the creditors were deeply surprised that the partial withdrawal of the suit affected the whole case. As for the criminal suit, after the prosecution was filed, the investigation took ten months and the court hearings were held three times. On December 19, the procuratorate delivered the disposition documents to the plaintiffs, two copies for each person. One copy was the indictment against Xie Liangda, the absconded bank manager, and the other was the non-prosecution disposition for the directors and warehouse keepers. However, the plaintiffs stated that there were some discrepancies in the factual aspects of the non-prosecution disposition document. Moreover, it was not mentioned that the directors, supervisors, and warehouse keepers of the bank recognized the absconding of the bank manager, all the acts of destroying evidence and concealing property were illegal and incomprehensible. It is now reported that the creditors' side is not satisfied with the court's judgment and intends to hold a meeting to discuss a unified response, decide to appeal and apply for a retrial, and have also submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice to thoroughly investigate to uphold the rule of law.</p>
<h3>Nan Hui: Impersonating Officials to Claim Stolen Goods, Arrested and Escorted to the County</h3>
<p>The Guanghua brand kerosene of the Shanghai Meida Company, carried by the Qiaji sailboat, was repeatedly stolen and intercepted in the sea area bordering Nan Hui and Feng Xian, and the case has been reported for investigation. Recently, hundreds of cans of kerosene were successively intercepted in the areas of Ni Cheng, Tangjiaozi, and in the Dongmen River of the city. The suspects Tang Guoxiang, Shao Genlian, and Jin Kaiyu were detained by the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Unexpectedly, Xi Youlin, nephew of Jin Guanxing, conceived a whimsical plan and led a Westerner, posing as the manager of the Madason Foreign Company, and false witnesses Cai Tiyi and Fang Fuchun, etc., chartered a small motorboat from Shanghai named "McCity" on the previous day, intending to impersonate the owner and claim the goods, and asked for the release of Jin Guanxing and others. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Jin Runzhang, recognized them immediately and detained Xi Youlin, Cai Tiyi, Fang Fuchun, etc. One Westerner escaped. The bureau immediately escorted Jin Guanxing and others who had been previously arrested to the county for interrogation. The hundreds of cans of kerosene that were intercepted were claimed by the Meida Company, who sent personnel to Nan Hui yesterday.</p>
<h3>Jia Ding: Robbery at a Dyeing Workshop near Humin Bridge</h3>
<p>In Humin Bridge Town of this county, more than ten robbers dressed in cloth skirts and armed with weapons broke through the Pai Men of Lu Yuanxing Liangfang at midnight on the 20th and robbed more than 300 bolts of cloth and 27 yuan in cash. Nearby villagers heard the noise and fired guns to pursue the robbers, who fled towards the Shanghai-Taiyuan Motor Road, setting fire to the bolts of cloth along the way. They were not caught.</p>
<h3>Wu Xi: Confiscation of a Large Batch of Japanese Watches</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county received a secret report the day before yesterday stating that Huaxingli, Hengdeli, Huadeli, and Hengdali watch companies on Tongyun Road had recently imported a large batch of Japanese watches and requested that personnel be dispatched to inspect them. After receiving the report, the association's Inspection Section Director Tu Lianfu, together with all inspectors, set out in groups, accompanied by Gu Liewu, the police chief of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, to conduct the inspection. Three wooden boxes of Japanese watches and thirty-five large clocks were seized at Huaxingli, three wooden boxes of Japanese watches and twenty-two large clocks were seized at Hengdeli, eight large clocks and eleven small clocks were seized at Huadeli, and three small clocks were seized at Hengdali. All of them were immediately sealed and sent to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for identification and disposal.</p>
<h3>Prevalence of Diphtheria and Smallpox in the City</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, there has been little rain and snow, and the climate has been unusually dry. As a result, diphtheria and smallpox are rampant inside and outside the city. Young children of school age, whose parents do not know how to prevent them, have been infected and died in considerable numbers. According to investigations, the number of people dying from these diseases in a single day is around several dozen, especially in the area within half a mile north of the city's tax office. Within a few hours, four children died of this disease, and the severity of the situation is truly alarming.</p>
<h3>Chang Zhou: Fruit Store Owner Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>Zhu Liangsheng, the owner of a fruit store on Xinfeng Street outside Zhongshan Gate in Wu Yi, hanged himself on a pine tree behind his house on the evening of the 19th due to high debts and urgent demands from creditors, which he could not meet. On the morning of the 20th, he was found by passersby and taken home for burial.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yin: Election Irregularities Spark Disputes</h3>
<p>Due to irregularities in the election of provincial representatives in various sub-districts of the Second District of this county, which were reported by the First District, the supervisor Huang Ren took the ballots to the province for counting. The Central Party Headquarters declared them invalid and ordered the Provincial Party Headquarters to investigate the personnel involved in the irregularities and propose separate penalties. The fraudulent district sub-divisions were declared invalid and the process of handling the incident should be reported to the Headquarters. After receiving the order, the Provincial Party Headquarters held a meeting yesterday (20th) morning to discuss the solution.</p>
<h3>Reporting Smoking Creates Unexpected Complications</h3>
<p>Gao Xiang, the head of Gaodun Township in the Tenth District, filed a lawsuit with the county government the other day, accusing Chen Zubei of smoking opium. The county government ordered the police to arrest and interrogate Chen according to the law. Subsequently, the defendant Chen Zubei surrendered himself and confessed that he had already gone to the hospital to quit. Then Gao Xiang declared that he was willing to accompany Chen to Renji Hospital to verify the facts. Now, Gao Xiang suddenly accused Judge Wang Cheng of the High Court of secretly detaining him in a secret room on the 15th and interrogating him severely late at night, forcing him to sign and seal, which he refused, resulting in him being ordered to be driven out of the door by the bailiffs. Judge Wang Cheng, upon hearing this, believed that Gao's words were arbitrary and fabricated, and yesterday he ordered the bailiff Wu Bowen to go to Suzhou to report to the High Court and order Gao Xiang to be brought to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Chang Shu: Concubine Surnamed Wang Commits Suicide Due to Abuse</h3>
<p>Wang Nianqu, a wealthy household living in Zhaixi, Dayi Bridge, moved to Xijing Bank in the city two years ago due to inconvenience in the countryside. Wang's wife, Zhang, had a son and a daughter. The son passed away two years ago, leaving a daughter. Because Wang had no son under his knee, he entrusted Wang Xueqing, who worked as a room attendant in a hotel, to introduce a former maidservant surnamed Wang as a concubine, named Wang Xiuan. Although her appearance was not outstanding, she was initially favored by Nianqu. However, the first wife was exceptionally fierce and did not allow her husband to sleep with the concubine. Before long, she ordered Xiuan to live alone in the upstairs attic and often beat her severely. Xiuan, unable to bear the abuse, had attempted suicide by drowning last year, but was rescued. The other day, Xiuan had another quarrel with Zhang. In a moment of anger, she went upstairs and hanged herself. It was not until the morning of the 20th that she was discovered. They immediately notified Xiuan's family. Xiuan's brother, Shunsheng, came to the city to deal with the matter. Wang, due to pressure from his father-in-law, did not dare to argue and only paid a hundred yuan to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>Jia Xing: Police Detective Implicated in Kidnapping Case, Arrested</h3>
<p>Changfu, the eldest son of Shi Ashui, a farmer from Shaoji Langjiaqiao in Kunlian, the sixth district of Xinghaiyan in Wangdian District, Jiaxing, was kidnapped by bandits on October 24. Five or six days later, he was murdered, and his body was weighted with stones and sunk in the Shenjiaqiao River in the northeast township of the fifth district (i.e., the first district of Wangdian). His corpse was later found floating, reported to the Jiaxing District Court for examination. Shi Ashui, because of the incident, dared not live in his village and moved to Daqiao Street in Wangdian East Town. He became acquainted with Guan Dexing, who claimed to be a detective in the sixth team of the Water Police, and observed that Guan's actions were suspicious. Guan repeatedly visited Shi's house before and after the kidnapping. However, due to lack of evidence, Shi did not dare to report him. Recently, the family of Zhong Ayang in Sangjiaqiao also received threatening letters. Ayang's son, Jinrong, went to Shanghai to negotiate, and Guan Dexing secretly followed him. Also, a similar incident happened to the family of Xia Jisheng. Guan had also revealed clues to Shi Ashui earlier. Therefore, Shi reported to the First A Baoan Tuan of Dongzhen in the Fifth District yesterday and had Guan arrested at the house of Yu Rongguan in Huanqiao Lane. The case was reported to the Haiyan County Government by telegram (because Haiyan had arrested a suspect). The Haiyan County Government sent Zhang Xiong, the police chief of the Shendang Public Security Bureau, along with police officers and four members of the Lianpu Temple Baoan Tuan, to Wangdian yesterday to bring the criminal to Salt for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhou: Miscellaneous Grain Industry Asks to Open the River Barrier</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from Gu Xingyi of the Shanghai County Grain Association stating that the canal water was dry, and thousands of ships going up and down the river were blocked at Mapeng Bay. As the end of the year was approaching, the merchants were in great difficulty. Although various gangs had sent telegrams to the provincial government requesting the opening of the river barrier, the agency in charge of the canal was in Yangzhou. Therefore, they planned to present the difficulties to the authorities nearby in order to open the barrier and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Yesterday (19th), the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Jingyan, forwarded the information to the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, stating the cause and requesting the opening of the barrier.</p>
<h3>Ru Gao: Robbery and Injury in Zhoujiazhuang</h3>
<p>Li Qiyin, an elderly man in his seventies from Zhoujiazhuang in Libao East Township, had a relatively well-off family. On the night of the previous day (17th), several robbers broke into his house, suffocated Li to death, and robbed him of more than 300 yuan in cash and two silver bracelets. The Li family reported the incident to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>An Assassination Case Occurred in Liu Miaozhuang</h3>
<p>Dai Guoqing, a carpenter from Wuyao Town, Chema Lake District, around forty years old, went to Shizhuang for business on the morning of the 17th. While walking to Liu Miaozhuang, about two miles from his home, he was suddenly assassinated. He was shot in the head, with the bullet entering from the throat and exiting from the back of the head. There were also six knife wounds all over his body. The local police officer reported the case to the county government, which sent personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise Over the Collection of Vehicle Donations</h3>
<p>The Automobile Industry Association outside the South Gate petitioned the Construction Department to exempt vehicle donations for three months, following the example of Nantong, due to the severe floods last year. The Construction Bureau of this county, because it had not received an order from the Department, continued to collect as usual, resulting in disputes. All workers went on strike and stopped business operations. The two sides insisted on their positions. The County Public Security Bureau, upon hearing this, believed that transportation was very important during this winter defense period. Therefore, it sent the section chief of the bureau to mediate. It is now reported that the bureau has agreed to postpone the collection for ten days, while the workers will not allow collection until an order is received from the Department. The two sides are still in dispute.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Younger Brother Kills Older Brother</h3>
<p>Wu Fengqi of Dongyang, who ran a plastering business in Yanding Lane, Lianqiao, Hangzhou, had a younger brother, Fenglin, who helped his brother in his business. The business was doing well. On the morning of the ninth of this month, Fengqi asked his brother for money and was refused. He immediately took a bamboo knife and ran upstairs. While Fengqi was still in bed, he stabbed him four times, twice in the head. Because Fenglin woke up and resisted with his feet, his left and right knees were also stabbed once each. At that time, Fenglin was still able to support himself and chased Fengqi to Lianqiao, where he caught Fengqi and sent him to the First District Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau for questioning and detention. He was later released on bail. After Fenglin was injured, the two wounds to his head were light, but the wounds to his knees were deep and wide. Because the treatment was not proper, his thighs became swollen and festered. He died of his injuries the other day. His brother, Fengqi, fled without a trace upon hearing the news. The Hangzhou County Court Procuratorate received the report and dispatched Prosecutor Zhao Zhisui and examiner Feng Shengxiang to Lezhu in Saozhou Bay, Jianggan, yesterday morning (21st) to perform an autopsy on the corpse. It was determined that Wu Fengqi had died of his injuries. They filled out an injury report and reported it to the court, and at the same time ordered the guarantor to hand over the murderer for punishment. It is reported that the murderer Wu Fengqi has been found in Lin'an County by the guarantor and will be escorted to Hangzhou for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Wang Delin's Representative, He Zixing, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Suffering in the Snowy Clothes While Fighting the Enemy</p>
<p>National Compatriots Eagerly Awaiting Assistance</p>
<p>General Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, recently sent Councilor He Zixing as a representative to go south through the pass to contact all parties for assistance. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Japanese-Japanese News Agency interviewed He at the United Liaison Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies in Shanghai yesterday. According to him, General Wang's army has a total of 70,000 soldiers, stationed in eastern Jilin, along the Middle East and Jidun roads. They currently occupy eleven counties including Dongning, Wangqing, Hunchun, Dunhua, Helong, Shulan, Emu, Antu, Ningan, and Muling (in co-defense with General Li Du). Since the uprising against the enemy, more than 2,500 Japanese soldiers have been killed. The most intense battle was in the south of Jingbo Lake in Ningan County, a few days before Yu (He Zixing referring to himself) set out to enter the pass. In this battle, 700 Japanese soldiers attacked from both sides. Our army lured the enemy deep on one side and defended the mountains on the other. The enemy was surrounded in the plains surrounded by mountains on all sides. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed by our soldiers, and countless weapons were captured. The battles at Laoye Ridge in Dunhua County were also very fierce. Our army bravely advanced, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army was exhausted and many committed suicide. Our army has now decided to advance along multiple routes to Jilin, Changchun, and Harbin to eliminate the enemy and the traitors. However, eastern provinces are extremely cold with snow depths of two feet. Our army is still wearing tattered clothes and straw shoes, desperately fighting the enemy. They lack ammunition and supplies. Yu was ordered to disguise himself and enter the pass to report to the compatriots in the pass, hoping to give assistance, then the recovery of lost land will surely be successful.</p>
<h3>Russian Goods Begin to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Large Shipments Must Wait Until Next Spring</p>
<p>White Russians in Shanghai Not Susceptible to Incitement</p>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Soviet goods will naturally sell well in our country. Some Russian goods have recently arrived. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Goods: Since the severance of relations, not many Russian goods have been shipped to China. The September 18th and January 28th incidents occurred successively, and China's boycott of Japanese goods began, leading to a large shipment of salmon, with the most arriving in October, totaling 70,000 pieces, which has defeated Japanese seafood products. Recently, Linji Timber Company has ordered a large amount of timber from Russia, which has now been shipped in millions of feet. Kerosene and gasoline have also been shipped successively. Chinese merchants are planning to contact for sales. Russian Suchang coal has better heating power than Japanese coal and is also more affordable. A batch has now been shipped and is already being sold on the market. Match splints are ordered by Chinese merchants from Japan, but many Russian goods have now been shipped. They are sturdy and superior to Japanese goods, and Chinese people are already trying them out. As for head cotton fabrics, only a small number have been shipped. A large number will be shipped in three months.</p>
<p>Shipping: Since the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Soviet merchant fleet has been reduced to the Shanghai-Vladivostok route and is handled by the East China Railway Society on behalf. Only one ship sails each month, and chartered ships are used for transportation. This year, the Soviet merchant fleet in Shanghai chartered a large number of Chinese ships to transport goods between Kamchatka and Vladivostok. Now that the river is frozen, the chartered ships have been returned to Shanghai. Many ships have arrived in Shanghai in recent days to terminate the contracts, each carrying a batch of goods. After the ice thaws next March, commercial ships will be chartered again for transportation.</p>
<p>Mail Service: Formal regular mail ships between China and Russia have not been operating since the severance of diplomatic relations. Now that the two countries have resumed diplomatic relations and the exchanges are becoming more frequent, the Soviet merchant fleet has decided to resume the regular mail ships between Shanghai and Vladivostok when the northern part of Vladivostok thaws and shipping is smooth. At that time, branches will be established in Hankou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and Tianjin to operate shipping. It is estimated that the earliest will be in three months.</p>
<p>White Russians: There are six or seven hundred White Russians in Shanghai, living in various places. Recently, there has been a rumor that after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, White Russians will not be able to stay in Shanghai, and there will be danger if they stay. The rumor intends to scare them into leaving Shanghai and going to Manchuria. The source of this rumor is self-evident to those who are discerning. However, most White Russians who have work in Shanghai are unwilling to leave here.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Bureau's Twenty Million Loan Case: Chen and Li Accused of Bribery and Abuse of Power</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Trial Concluded with Final Arguments</p>
<p>Li Guojie Still Sent to Hospital Under Surveillance</p>
<p>Li Guojie, former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Chen Fumu, former Vice Minister of Communications and concurrently Supervisor, due to mortgaging wharves and warehouses to the American China Development Corporation for a loan of twenty million taels of silver, of which seven hundred thousand was paid in advance and taken by Chen Fumu, resulting in bribery and infringement of rights, etc., was reported by Zhu Jiaji, Minister of Communications, who sent Li for investigation by the local court and issued an arrest warrant for Chen Fumu. Now, the court's prosecutor's office has filed a public prosecution against Chen Fumu and Li Guojie.</p>
<p>People Present in Court Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the criminal court held a public trial. The court specially appointed police chief Chen Junfang, police officers Chen Xihui, Zhu Yongqing, etc., to supervise and direct the bailiffs to maintain order in the courtroom.  Police were also dispatched to Shanghai Hospital to accompany Li Guojie to the court. After reporting, Criminal Court President Qian Chengjun, along with judges Shen Youqi, Sun Xiaolou, prosecutor Xie Ju, secretary Jiang Meixuan, etc., opened a collegial panel in the first courtroom. Defendant Li Guojie hired lawyers Sha Xunyi, Zhang Yipeng, and Jiang Yiping to defend him. The gallery was already full at this time. Court President Shen Xiqing also had a special seat to observe the proceedings.</p>
<p>Li Sits While Being Interrogated The presiding judge ordered Li Guojie to be brought to court. Li, wearing a black leather coat, was helped to the court by two people, appearing extremely fatigued. The lawyer presented a hospital certificate stating that Li was seriously ill, unable to stand, and requested permission for him to sit during the questioning. The judge granted the request and allowed Li to sit while providing his statement. The judge first asked Li his age, address, and occupation. He answered, "Fifty-two years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at 1050 Xiafei Road, formerly the General Manager and Chairman of the China Merchants Bureau. I have never committed a crime before, nor have I joined any party."</p>
<p>The Prosecutor's Indictment At this point, the judge asked the prosecutor to state the main points of the indictment, saying that the defendant Chen Fumu was the Vice Minister of Communications and concurrently Supervisor, and Li Guojie was the General Manager. In July of this year, they mortgaged a large portion of the China Merchants Bureau's property to the American China Development Corporation for a loan. Because Chen Fumu withheld the contract, the China Development Corporation advanced 700,000 taels, which was given to Chen Fumu, resulting in a contract that greatly damaged many rights. The defendants are accused of violating Article 366, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Because they are public officials, they should be punished according to Article 140 of the same law. As for the bribery part, the indictment is based on Article 129. Li Guojie is to be punished according to Articles 74, 70, and 38 of the same law. A public trial is requested. After the prosecutor finished his statement,</p>
<p>The Details of Holding Office The judge then interrogated Li Guojie, asking, "In what year did you become Chairman?" He answered, "From 1924 until now." The judge asked, "When did you become General Manager?" He answered, "I received the order from the ministry on March 26th, and took over the affairs on April 4th." The judge asked, "Who was the minister at that time?" He answered, "Chen Minggui." The judge asked, "Who were the Vice Ministers at that time?" He answered, "Political Vice Minister Chen Fumu, Permanent Vice Minister Yu Feipeng." The judge asked, "What was the connection that led to your appointment?" He answered, "The ministry appointed me as manager because of my connection with the China Merchants Bureau." The judge asked, "Did you know the minister and vice ministers before?" He answered, "No, I didn't know them." The judge asked, "Are you saying that they appointed you as general manager with no prior connection?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "Since there was no connection, were you appointed as general manager to reorganize the China Merchants Bureau?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "Did you come with the determination to reorganize it?" He answered, "I was in the position of a shareholder and hoped to reorganize it."</p>
<p>Four Contracts in Total The judge asked, "What were the reorganization strategies?" He answered, "When I took over, we were at the end of our rope. We couldn't reorganize without a large loan." The judge asked, "Did you proceed with the loan later?" He answered, "Guo Waifeng had this plan last year as a commissioner. If there hadn't been this plan, I wouldn't have dared to take the job." The judge asked, "Is Guo Waifeng's plan the China Development Corporation?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "When did you negotiate with the China Development Corporation?" He answered, "Last July, I joined as Chairman of the Board." The judge asked, "Did you continue to handle it after you became General Manager?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "When were the contracts signed?" He answered, "The initial signing was in early September." The judge asked, "How many contracts were there in total?" He answered, "Four in total: one for construction loan, one for wharf loan, one for ship purchase loan, and one for wharf leasing." The judge asked, "Were they all signed?" He answered, "I signed them according to Supervisor Chen Fumu's orders." The judge asked, "Were all the contracts approved?" He answered, "All of them were approved." The judge asked, "How much was the wharf loan?" He answered, "Ten million." The judge asked, "How much was the construction loan?" He answered, "Ten million." The judge asked, "The ship purchase part was not determined because thirty ships were needed. The price could not be determined in advance. The ships had different sizes and suitability." The judge asked, "How much of the two loans has been paid?" He answered, "The loans have not been paid. The price can only be paid after the bonds are issued. Therefore, we took 700,000 first."</p>
<p>Seven Hundred Thousand Advance The judge asked, "What is this for?" He answered, "Advance payment." The judge asked, "Who brought it?" He answered, "The comprador Shen Litang of the China Development Corporation brought it." The judge asked, "What day was it brought?" He answered, "September 23rd." The judge asked, "Where was it delivered?" He answered, "At my office in the China Merchants Bureau." The judge asked, "Did you issue a receipt?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "Where did the 700,000 go?" He answered, "Given to the supervisor." The judge asked, "What day was it given?" He answered, "Given on the same day." The judge asked, "Directly?" The judge asked, "Directly?" He answered, "The supervisor sent a representative, Huang Jusu, to take it." The judge asked, "What does Huang Jusu do?" He answered, "I don't know. The supervisor called first to have it handed over to the person who came to take it." The judge asked, "When the payment was made on September 23rd, had the supervisor already approved the contract?" He answered, "It had already been approved." The judge asked, "What is the nature of the 700,000 taels?" He answered, "Advance." The judge asked, "Couldn't it be established without paying?" He answered, "The China Merchants Bureau really couldn't do without the loan. Because when it was sent to the supervisor's office for stamping, the development corporation stated that issuing bonds would take time and asked for secrecy temporarily. The supervisor said that it wouldn't be credible without paying cash, so it was used as a deposit."</p>
<p>The Delivery of a Huge Sum The judge asked, "Where did this money go?" He answered, "The supervisor said that this was the whole plan, and he would keep it together for future consolidation." The judge asked, "Why not keep it in the bureau?" He answered, "This was following the orders of my superior." The judge asked, "Are you saying that you don't know where this 700,000 went?" He answered, "We have already handed it over to the supervisor's office for him to keep." The judge asked, "You said that the 20 million was for reorganizing the business. This 700,000 had nothing to do with the reorganization." He answered, "Reorganization cannot be done easily." The judge asked, "After Huang Jusu took the money, did you meet with Chen Fumu?" He answered, "Yes, I did." The judge asked, "Did you ask him?" He answered, "I asked him, and he said that it would be released publicly, but it never came. I later went to Nanjing and Hankou to inspect the current state of the bureau, so I didn't ask anymore." The judge asked, "Didn't you say before that the supervisor had power, and if you didn't give the money, he wouldn't approve it?" He answered, "Because if China doesn't take an advance payment from foreigners, it will all be in vain in the future." The judge asked, "Were most of the 700,000 taels checks?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "Are you saying that the approval came before the money?" He answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>Various Aspects of the Loan The judge asked, "Did Chen Fumu ever release the approved contract?" He answered, "It was released on September 23rd." The judge asked, "Was it released after taking the money?" He answered, "Yes." The judge asked, "Does the construction loan damage the China Merchants Bureau's property?" He answered, "The land has been abandoned for a long time, and there is no money to build. The loss is very large, and it is mortgaged out, and the debt is pressing. Now that it can be built, the debt can also be repaid, and the land price is also rising day by day." The judge asked, "What about the wharf loan?" He answered, "The wharf was originally mortgaged to Jardine Matheson Bank, and it should have been repaid at the end of last year, but there was no money to repay it. If we don't find another way, we will never have money to repay it. Wouldn't it be disposed of by the creditor?" The judge asked, "Does it damage the shipping rights?" He answered, "The China Merchants Bureau only has twenty broken ships. They must be replaced with new ones, but we don't have the power to do it ourselves. We have to borrow the power of others to develop. It is borrowed from the American Dollar Steamship Company, so there is only profit and no loss. As for the supervisor's regulations, we only have to obey the general manager and cannot directly sue the ministry, and are subject to the supervisor's command. Later, I returned from Nanjing, and the China Merchants Bureau had been reorganized. I should hand over the duties, so I reported the previous matters to Minister Zhu."</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Opinion At this point, the lawyer requested to begin the debate. Prosecutor Xie then gave his opinion, saying that the defendants had committed four counts of violating Article 366: 1. handling affairs for others; 2. intending to obtain illegal benefits for oneself or a third party; 3. intending to inflict illegal damage on oneself; and 4. acting in violation of one's duties, causing damage to one's own property. Li Guojie deliberately damaged the China Merchants Bureau, which is very clear. According to the supervisor's regulations, only cleaning up creditor and debtor rights. Furthermore, the China Merchants Bureau is a privately-run state-owned enterprise. According to the private operation there should have been a board meeting. For the state-run Commercial Bureau, the supervising agency is the Ministry of Communications. The illegal elements cannot be obtained with Chen Fumu's order and are not related to the crime. Regarding whether or not there was damage, one cannot determine without an expert assessment. But according to ordinary observation, it is very obvious that the three wharf mortgage contracts contain clauses stating that if the debt is not fulfilled, the creditor has the right to auction it off. Therefore, the defendants are accused of violating the aforementioned article. But being public officials, they are to be punished according to Article 140. Furthermore, the defendant confessed during the investigation that Chen Fumu did not want to give small benefits, so even today when it was sent up it wasn’t issued. I only cared about the big picture, and gave a little to get it issued, which violates Article 129. He asked that a public trial be conducted according to the law.</p>
<p>Lawyer's Defense Defendant's lawyer Zhang stated that since the government sent a commissioner to supervise the China Merchants Bureau, its main body has belonged to the government, and the shareholders' rights have long been stripped away. Therefore, the supervisor and general manager are all appointed by the government and act according to the government's intentions. The supervisor is the representative of the government, so it does not comply with the article on handling affairs for others. As for intending to cause illegal damage, it can be understood by examining the contracts that have been signed and those that have not. The previous interest owed was over one percent, but now it is only nine percent. Regarding the three warehouses, they were originally set up for overseas development, but now they are all dilapidated, so the warehouse receipts are rejected by the banks, and people are unwilling to store goods there. Now, by borrowing the power of others to build new houses, the banks will be effective and can make money. How to repay the ten million taels? They will use the 300,000 taels of rent money and organize a wharf company, with the bureau having half of the profits. In a few years, it can be cleared. This is for the sake of great profit, and it is also for the government to recover state assets. Each share is fifty taels, for a total of forty thousand, which is over two million taels. The various items are less than twenty million, but they mortgaged twenty million. What is the loss? As for the shipping rights, they are exchanging twenty broken ships for thirty new ships, without having to pay money. They are borrowing the joint transportation of Dollar Steamship Company to expand their business. Dollar Steamship Company is only in charge of accounting. What loss of shipping rights is there? This is the way to production. As for the 700,000 bribe, according to various proofs and letters, it is clear that it is a deposit and payment. How can it be done in a personal seat at 3 PM? Advance and subsequent deposits are also common occurrences. Lawyer Sha added that Li Guojie, as far as we can see now, has only benefited the China Merchants Bureau and has not harmed it. The prosecutor also said that without expert evaluation, one cannot determine whether there was indeed damage. So why not investigate and determine the damage before filing a lawsuit? Therefore, it can be considered that it cannot be the main reason for the crime. Moreover, Chen Fumu took the money, according to Article 35 of the Criminal Law, a superior official can take it for safekeeping, so of course there is no crime. Where is the safekeeping actually, that is not related to Li Guojie. Li Guojie was originally a major shareholder, with a strong patriotic heart, and used all his efforts to revive the company, with the intention of completely safeguarding the interests of the country. As for the 700,000 taken by Chen Fumu, according to the interpretation of the Supreme Court, Li Guojie is also a victim. If it were a bribe, why would there be a receipt, and why would it be noted as a deposit, fully proving it was part of the loan? Please declare him innocent. Lawyer Jiang also stated that this case involves a large loan of thirty million and the 700,000 taken by Chen Fumu, which has led to shocking rumors outside. However, a crime must be determined by the suspect's actions, not by speculation. One cannot involve Li Guojie because of Chen Fumu's actions. Attention and comparison should be paid. The China Merchants Bureau already owes 17 million. If it is not managed, the creditors will forcibly execute the auction. Therefore, it is necessary to attract foreign investment to develop the business. Even the Ministry of Finance has borrowed foreign debt to run real businesses. If borrowing foreign debt is a crime, then all the previous finance ministers should be tried for their crimes. Using other people's money to seek profit, compared to the future when the court seals and auctions it off, which is more beneficial? The supervisor is appointed by the government. The general manager obeys the order in everything and believes in the government and believes in the officials' orders. Therefore, Li Guojie is not responsible. Furthermore, Li Guojie was placed under hospital surveillance due to administrative interference after being released on bail by the prosecutor's office, which has not healed his illness. However, Li Guojie was born in Shanghai, lives in Shanghai, and his property is all in the China Merchants Bureau. If there is a risk of escape, he would not go to President Song's residence. Therefore, it can be guaranteed by a lawyer and does not need to be kept under surveillance in the hospital again. The law can sometimes correct the administration.</p>
<p>The Debate Concluded At this point, the judge asked if the parties had any opinions and then announced the conclusion of the debate, setting the verdict for 2 PM on the 27th of this month. Li Guojie was still subject to the previous disposition and sent to Shanghai Hospital for surveillance. The secretary read the record of the proceedings, and the court was adjourned at 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Three Telegraph Bureau Messengers Strike, Company Takes a Strong Stance</h3>
<p>Refuses to Negotiate, Hires New Workers</p>
<p>All seventy-seven messengers of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Telegraph Bureaus have gone on strike to demand better treatment, and have petitioned the city party headquarters for mediation and assistance. In order to maintain normal telegraph delivery, the company immediately recruited over a dozen Western children to deliver to each household. Yesterday, there was no progress on either side, and the company's attitude was extremely tough. The chief, Peng Sheng, has gone to Beijing for other major cases, so he has entrusted the secretary, Mr. Peter, to preside over the case, instructing him to recruit new workers and reject any negotiations. Therefore, Dai Yongzhan, the representative of the city party headquarters, did not go to the capital side for mediation yesterday. According to the opinions of the workers, no matter what, the company must agree to one or two of their demands before they can uniformly resume work.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Mediates the Longzhang Factory Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Both Sides to Attempt Reconciliation Outside Within Three Days</p>
<p>Workers at the Longzhang Paper Mill in Longhua, outside the Rihui Bridge, opposed the company's arbitrary fines and unjustified dismissal of workers. After a strike by female workers occurred, the party and government agencies advised them to resume work first and wait for investigation. The Social Bureau specially convened a mediation yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, attended by Pan Zhian and Zhang Qianhai of the Longzhang Paper Mill, Bao Xiangsheng and Yang Jiezhen of the First District Paper Industry Union, and Zhao Erchang, a cadre of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section of the Social Bureau, presided over the meeting, and Wang Zuofang recorded the minutes. First, the labor and management parties made statements regarding 1) the case of the dismissal of female worker Bao Jingui, No. 141. The workers demanded reinstatement, but the company believed that she had instigated the strike and insisted on dismissing her. Regarding 2) the case of arbitrary fines, the company agreed to cancel them and formulate new reward and punishment methods, which would be submitted to the主管官署 for approval. The workers expressed their agreement. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, regarding the first item, both sides believed that it should be considered. The chairman then announced that both sides would attempt reconciliation outside within three days. If it cannot be resolved, it will be reviewed according to law. It was not dismissed until 3 PM.</p>
<h3>Another New Anti-Aircraft Device</h3>
<p>Li Kerong Offers Plans to the Volunteer Army Support Association</p>
<p>The Japanese army's bombing everywhere has caused us heavy losses. Patriotic people have invented defensive products one after another. There was once Wang Maoqing from Lu, who invented a flying arrow, but the research has not yet been successful, so he is still continuing his efforts. Li Kerong, a citizen of this city, has been working in the ordnance agencies of various provinces in Hubei and Shanxi. Recently, he has researched a new type of anti-aircraft gun, the firing range of which can reach three or four thousand meters, which is sufficient to restrain aircraft. Yesterday, Mr. Li wrote to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, saying, (Above, The news is that the council's regular meeting decided to manufacture the latest weapons, look for specialized personnel, Kerong has been working in Guangdong, Hubei, Hebei, Jin, and Liaoning provinces, responsible for manufacturing, and has a lot of research, especially on air defense, such as transforming a new type of anti-aircraft machine gun, the firing range of which should be above 4,000 meters, and its effectiveness is sufficient to restrain aircraft. Compared with the 30-section water machine gun manufactured by the former Shanghai Ordnance Factory, the firing range is only 2,000 meters, and the materials and labor cost 1,200 yuan. The materials and labor for the new type of anti-aircraft machine gun built by Kerong only cost 1,000 yuan. If it is approved, two samples can be built first, and if the connection degree and distance are satisfactory, they can be reproduced. I heard that the support party has already written to Mr. Li for an interview because they do not know the details. If successful, it may also be one of the ways for the warriors outside the pass to resist Japan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks to Facilitate Domestic Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>Please Urge Rice Merchants in Fujian and Guangdong Not to Purchase Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in light of the abundant autumn harvest nationwide this year, the drastic drop in grain prices, and the continued procurement of foreign rice in areas with circulation difficulties, telegraphed the Fuzhou and Guangzhou chambers of commerce yesterday, asking them to inform rice merchants to prioritize the purchase of domestic rice. Simultaneously, it sent letters to various rice industry groups in the city, such as the Soybean and Rice Trade Association, Rice Shop Association, and Miscellaneous Grains and Oilcake Trade Association, informing them of the procedures for transporting rice out of the province. The telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Fuzhou and Guangzhou Chambers of Commerce: This year, all rice-producing provinces report bumper harvests. Anhui and Jiangxi rice is allowed to leave the provinces without inspection fees, and the same applies to Jiangsu rice. The government has approved the nationwide circulation of grain, which is now in effect. Please urge rice merchants to cease purchasing foreign rice and prioritize the procurement of domestic rice to prevent a drastic drop in grain prices and the bankruptcy of rural areas. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Respectfully,</p>
<p>Letter: On the 20th of this month, a letter was received from the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation stating that the 5th Executive Committee meeting and the 7th joint meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committee members held on November 21st resolved that, given the drastic drop in grain prices this year and the difficulties faced by farmers and merchants, a request should be submitted to the provincial government to allow the circulation of rice and grain from the province to provide relief. This proposal was the first item discussed at the 551st Provincial Government Committee meeting. It was noted that in years with average harvests, the province's rice and grain production was only sufficient for self-sufficiency, hence the ban on exports in previous years to maintain the people's food supply. This year, however, a bumper autumn harvest is reported nationwide, including in this province, leading to a daily drastic drop in national grain prices. Farmers rely on the autumn harvest for their livelihood after a year of hard work. The current drop in grain prices has had a significant economic impact on farmers in this province. If remedial measures are not taken urgently, the entire province's rural areas are at risk of bankruptcy. In addition to ordering all counties to earnestly manage grain storage according to the previous order and within the specified timeframe, and announcing to all honest gentry and merchants in the province to stockpile food to increase demand and raise grain prices, it is now proposed to temporarily allow the export of food from the province to raise grain prices and alleviate the people's hardship. The resolution awaits public decision on whether or not to approve it. The resolution states that, for the sake of adjusting social finance and rural economic activity, the province's rice and wheat are temporarily permitted to be sold outside the province, but a passport must be obtained from the county government and forwarded to the provincial government for verification. No fees will be charged for the passport. Anyone transporting goods out of the province without a passport will be investigated and punished according to the regulations. The above resolution of the provincial government concerns the food supply of the entire province, and the matter is of great importance. It should be recorded and communicated immediately for implementation.</p>
<p>[Preparations for the Institute of Forensic Medicine Five-Year Plan]</p>
<p>An Interview with Director Lin Jizhi</p>
<p>China's forensic medicine has always been extremely underdeveloped. Whenever difficult cases arise, there is no clear identification to determine the verdict, and foreigners can take advantage of this to accuse China's judiciary of being obscure, infringing on our legal rights. Although negotiations have taken place, nothing has been recovered. The Ministry of Judicial Administration, in view of this, has a plan to set up a forensic research institution. Previously, the 324th Central Political Conference resolved to set up a special institute of forensic medicine. The National Government issued a clear order for the Ministry of Judicial Administration to prepare for this. The ministry then established a medical research institute in Zhenru, west of Shanghai. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited Director Lin Ji at the institute in Zhenru yesterday to inquire about the institute's preparation process and future implementation plans. Director Lin provided detailed information, which is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Preparation Process According to Lin, the Institute of Forensic Medicine, originally named the Institute of Forensic Examination, began preparations in 1929. The following year, land was purchased in Zhenru, Shanghai, to build housing, and various books and machines were purchased in Europe, costing 170,000 yuan. This year, due to the pressure from the Japanese, the site was occupied and temporarily suspended. In April of this year, an order was received from the Ministry to continue preparations. After the Japanese troops withdrew, the site was recovered. After negotiations, there were few losses. However, when inventorying the supplies and equipment, it was found that the necessary instruments and medicines for initial inspections, injury examinations, and disease examinations were not yet in place. Therefore, Secretary Zhang Dachun of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court was requested to assist in the procurement with maximum frugality. As a result, only 26,000 yuan was spent to complete all the currently applicable items and necessary preparations. The preparation office was officially closed at the end of July, and moved into the new building to begin work.</p>
<p>Scope of Responsibilities The institute's scope of responsibilities includes the examination and testing of corpses and physical and documentary evidence related to forensic cases from all provinces and regions, as well as injury compensation, mental state assessment, personal identification, feigned injury and illness, etc. All levels of courts, agencies, and organizations can send cases to the institute. Examinations and tests are conducted according to the latest scientific methods. Individuals can also come to the institute to carry out examinations for themselves and all factual evidence, and the institute will issue identification certificates or proof documents for verification. In addition, the institute will recruit researchers and trainees to train specialized personnel.</p>
<p>Layout and Equipment In addition to the director's office, section chief's office, staff offices, public hall, lecture hall, meeting room, archive room, dormitory, living room, and garage, the institute is equipped with a chemical testing room, physical evidence inspection room, weighing room, puppet room, pathological tissue examination room, bacteriological serology examination room, ultraviolet light analysis room, autopsy room, photography room, first and second consultation rooms, a mental state assessment reception room, waiting room, corpse identification room, corpse preservation cold storage room, animal breeding room, library specimen room, various heavy machinery rooms, refrigeration machines, heating machines, bath machines, and water machines. A morgue is also planned to be built, which is currently being measured and constructed. Next year, it is also planned to build a poison garden to grow poisonous substances. Various large and small instruments and machines in the research institute are ordered from Germany, the United States, and France. Microscopes and various magnifying glasses are all produced by Zeiss. Test reagents, pigments, and chemicals are mostly German and American products. Glassware is partly from Yena and other world factories, and partly from domestic products. Furniture is designed and manufactured by craftsmen. Among the instruments, equipment such as ultraviolet light analysis devices, blood spectrophotometers, microscopic spectrophotometers, micro scales, right-angle illumination measuring instruments, electrical titration devices, microchemical instruments, precision balances, electrically powered mixers, electrically powered precipitators, electrically powered drying ovens, electrically powered water bath devices, electrically powered leaching devices, Whedon incubators, stereoscopic cameras, microphotographic cameras, stereoscopic microscopes, physical evidence reflection machines, evidence photographing devices, firearms and physical evidence, and fingerprint identification equipment are rare and valuable equipment among specialized medical research institutions in China. In addition, there are corpse transport coffins and trucks for transporting patients and goods, which are specially used for transportation. The animal breeding room is used to produce blood identification serum for humans and animals, and parental identification serum. The mental state assessment reception room is a soft-walled room to accommodate mental patients. The cold storage cabinet is equipped with cold air and has 30 corpse platforms to store corpses and prevent them from decaying. These are rare facilities in other medical offices in China. In the future, it is planned to create corpse beautification and long-term preservation services. As for general consultations, autopsies, pathological examinations, physiological examinations, chemical examinations, qualitative and quantitative analysis of animals, bacterial tests, serum cultures, test trials, and other necessary supplies, as well as diagnostic and emergency medicines, various large and small sterilizers, refrigeration machines, carbonic acid gas machines, water filters, hot water machines, distillation water machines, heating furnaces, water towers, the institute has all the necessary large and small water pipes, artesian wells, incinerators, and water platforms. However, the water well was destroyed by Japanese soldiers and a new one has recently been opened and will soon be completed.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Cases Accepted Since its opening four months ago, the Chinese institute has handled cases such as the case of Zhang Laosi in Qingpu, whose cause of death from strangulation and hanging was unclear; the case of Xu Zhao in Changshu, whose bones were found drowned and the cause of death was unclear; the case of Jiang Xiaoshu, a four-year-old girl in Shanghai, to determine whether she died from rape; the case transferred from the Nanjing Health Department regarding whether the internal organs of military prisoner Lang Mengzhong died from illness or poisoning; the case transferred from the Peking Medical College to determine whether the remaining bones burned in the murder case at Xingfenglou in a certain county were human bones, male or female bones, new or old bones, bones of the elderly or young, and whether they were burned before or after death; the case of Zhang Xiaofa in Nantong to determine whether the mooncakes were poisonous; the case of Li Yongquan in Shandong regarding the examination of the internal organs and bones of his two young daughters for poison; the case transferred from the Academia Sinica regarding the bones and blood-stained clothing unearthed from a monastery in Yixing; and the case of Chen Amao in Chongming County, whose cause of death was unknown. These were all sensational and unsolvable cases that have been resolved. Other cases related to poison testing, drug testing, addiction testing, injury testing, blood testing, fingerprint testing, etc., have been sent to the institute for examination and identification by courts or agencies from as far as Hebei and Hunan, and as near as Zhejiang and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Financial Allocation The Institute of Forensic Medicine's regular budget for 1932 is 59,760 yuan, or 4,980 yuan per month. Currently, it has been ordered to reduce the amount by 10%, resulting in 4,482 yuan (details of the allocation are omitted).</p>
<p>Additional Purchases The equipment for forensic examination and research should include the equipment of all departments of medical schools, hospitals, pharmaceutical schools, or chemical colleges. The more complete the equipment and books, the more convenient the identification will be, not only increasing the speed but also facilitating the search for evidence. Due to budget limitations during the preparation period, only the essential equipment was purchased, so it is necessary to continue to add to it in the future. The most important items are: (1) an X-ray machine; (2) reference books related to forensic medicine and chemical examination, and subscriptions to various forensic journals from various countries, as well as self-made charts, plant specimens, and models; (3) other chemical and investigative instruments and equipment. Future Plans The institute has also formulated methods for future plans, which will be carried out in stages. Plans for next year (1933) include: (a) training forensic medicine and forensic chemistry personnel; (b) expanding the poison garden; (c) building more dormitories; (d) expanding the photography room and book storage room. Plans for 1934 include: (a) public research; (b) establishing an investigation department; (c) training criminal police; (d) establishing a branch of the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Peiping. Plans for 1935 include: (a) adding a mental assessment room, reception room, research room, miscellaneous items room, and scattered buildings; (b) establishing more branches; (c) sending personnel abroad to study forensic facilities in various countries. Plans for 1936 include: (a) establishing a school; (b) expanding the institute's organization; (c) building more school buildings. Plans for 1937 include: (a) establishing a mental hospital; (b) planning a smoking cessation center for opium addicts.</p>
<p>Tariff Law Under Study</p>
<p>Whether Tax Rates Will Be Included Is Undecided</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Zhou Dian, the deputy chairman of the National Tariff Commission, told reporters yesterday that the drafting of the tariff law has been under constant consideration and research by the customs authorities for the past two years. Recently, Shanghai business circles have petitioned the central government to expedite the formulation and promulgation. The Ministry of Finance is now actively working to implement it as soon as possible. As for the content, in addition to the administrative law governing tariffs, whether the tax rates will be included is something I do not yet know. The U.S. tariff law includes all types of tax rates, while the Japanese tariff law is formulated separately. It would be easier for our country to follow the latter, but if we follow the former, then all types of tax rates must also be included, resulting in many clauses and a more complicated draft. As for whether the part of the law related to tax rates will be re-examined by the Tariff Commission, it is currently unknown. The Sino-Russian commercial treaty and the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, which expires in March next year, have not yet been ordered by the Ministry to be drafted. According to past practice, such treaties are drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant agencies, and then the articles on commercial tax rates are submitted to this committee for research. It is expected that the Sino-Russian and other commercial treaties will also be submitted to this committee for research after they are drafted.</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui's Telegram to Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>24th Army Representative Declares Forgery</p>
<p>Leng Jiesheng, the representative of the 24th Army, made the following statement to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday: "The situation in Sichuan recently has been extremely complex, and the tactics of sowing discord are endless. The report published the other day regarding Chairman Liu's personal telegram to Mr. Zhang Yuejun on New Year's Day, which fabricated recent battle conditions, is completely untrue. Mr. Zhang has not received this telegram, and we have not received the aforementioned telegram either. It is obviously a forgery by treacherous individuals in an attempt to sow discord between our army and the 20th Army. Their efforts are futile and not worth the attention of discerning individuals. The fact that our army and the 21st Army are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the Rongxian and Renshou areas is a necessary measure for our army's ultimate self-defense and the achievement of peace. We have absolutely no intention of defeating others or envying anyone. I can state this responsibly. As for the recent battle conditions, our army has engaged in multiple bloody battles with the Yu Army from the 7th to the 9th, and has advanced from the Qingshen and Jiading areas to the Shuanggu Tomb, Laojun Terrace, Changshan Bridge, and Lijiachang areas near Rongxian, a distance of more than one hundred li. The outcome will be clear in a few days."</p>
<h3>Chinese Sailors Arrested by Japanese Police Released</h3>
<p>Efforts of the Seamen's Party Department</p>
<p>Three Chinese sailors on the British merchant ship "Russland" who were previously arrested by the Japanese police have been released. The Preparatory Committee of the Special Seamen's Party Department of China telegraphed the Chinese Minister to Japan to negotiate their release and telegraphed the Chinese Consul in Nagasaki to negotiate nearby. This was reported in the previous news. It is now learned that the Seamen's Party Department received a reply telegram from the Consul in Nagasaki yesterday, informing them that the Chinese sailors have been fully released. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Preparatory Committee of the Special Seamen's Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang: Your telegram of the 10th is received. The three Chinese sailors on the British ship "Russland" have been fully released after negotiations and have returned to their original ship to serve. Knowing your concern, we send this telegram in reply. Respectfully, the Consulate of the Republic of China in Nagasaki."</p>
<h3>Trade Statistics Between China and Russia Since 1921</h3>
<p>Since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, there has been little detailed investigation of trade between the two countries. Now that diplomatic relations have been restored, a detailed investigation of the general situation of trade between the two countries is necessary. Russian goods shipped to China are mainly kerosene, leather goods, and wood, while Chinese goods exported are mainly tea, soybeans, and soybean cakes. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about trade statistics between China and Russia over the past decade at the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which are listed as follows:</p>

<h3>Burmese Overseas Chinese Representatives Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Appealing for the Import Tax on Silver from Burma</p>
<p>The Tengchong area of Yunnan borders British Burma. According to the Burmese treaty, there is no import tax on trade between the two sides. However, on October 15th, the Burmese government ordered that all silver transported to Burma be subject to import tax. At the same time, 600 bars of silver transported to Burma by Yunnan merchants were detained in Bamo, Burma. Consul Xu in Yangon negotiated for their release, but to no avail. In order to inform the country of the truth and request unified assistance, the Burmese overseas Chinese merchants entrusted Xu Youfan, the chairman of the Tengchong Chamber of Commerce, who was coming to Shanghai, to appeal on their behalf. Xu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and is staying at the Far Eastern Hotel on Tibet Road.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Telecommunications to be Implemented Next Spring</h3>
<p>From Shanghai to London Central Telegraph, the Ministry of Communications previously signed a treaty with the British Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company to exchange telegrams. However, due to financial constraints, it was delayed. According to sources from the International Telecommunications Bureau, the matter is about to be realized. The funds for handling Sino-British telecommunications need to be allocated from the Central Committee and the Huai River Guidance Committee. The Ministry of Communications has requested the committee to allocate funds. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee will approve the allocation within one or two weeks. Once the funds are received, the project can proceed. Sino-British telecommunications are expected to be implemented by next spring.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Panshu and Yakumo Arrive This Morning</h3>
<p>Military Cables Installed on North Sichuan Road Yesterday</p>
<p>Arrival of Panshu and Yakumo The Japanese naval training ships Yakumo and Panshu, each with 9,800 tons, carrying over 700 officers and soldiers from various naval schools, arrived in Shanghai from Yokosuka Naval Port in Japan, via Lushun, Dalian, and Qingdao. Commanded by Vice Admiral Hyakutake Gengo, they are scheduled to enter the Huangpu River at 10:30 this morning and dock at the Wayside Wharf.</p>
<p>Commander Meets with Various Circles Upon arrival in Shanghai, Hyakutake, accompanied by Staff Officer Takahashi and Adjutant Taira, first went to the Japanese Consulate to meet with naval authorities from the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries. At noon, Commander Minnei of the Third Fleet hosted a banquet on the Izumo warship to entertain Hyakutake. The commanders of the two ships, Suzuki Kasuke and Niimi Masaichi, were also present. In the afternoon, they visited naval vessels of various countries stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. In the evening, the Japanese community held a welcoming party at the Japanese Club.</p>
<p>Soldiers Visit War Zone The officers and soldiers on the two ships will land at 11:00 this morning to visit the various units of the Third Fleet in Hongkou. In the afternoon, they will gather in front of the Gongda Cotton Mill. At 6:00, they will attend the welcoming party at the Japanese Club. On the 23rd, they will visit the Marine Corps and inspect new weapons, then visit the naval cemetery, and then go to Jiangwan to view the battle traces. Then they will return to the Zhabei Road to visit the ruins of the Commercial Press. On the third day, they will visit the Observatory and the Tongwen Academy, and stroll along Nanjing Road. They will return to the ship at 5:00 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Installation of Military Cables Yesterday at around 2:00 PM, Sugisaka, the commander of the Japanese Navy's Marine Corps in Shanghai, sent a platoon of soldiers in truck number 9823, carrying a large amount of military cable materials, to install military cables in the North Sichuan Road area. Double lines were installed along the utility poles on the left side of North Sichuan Road. At Bazijiao Road, the military cables were installed eastward, all the way to Pudong.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Using Unstamped Indian Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Strict Handling Even for Unintentional Purchases</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to prohibit the use of unstamped weights and measures from India. The main point is that from now on, once discovered, whether it is intentional fraud or an unintentional purchase, it will be strictly handled according to the law without leniency.</p>
<h3>Report on the Inspection of the Sha-Ying-Luo-Huai Dike Works</h3>
<p>The Dike Works Inspection Group reports to Chairman Song: Respectfully to Chairman Song of the Shanghai National Government's Flood Relief Committee. Having carefully reviewed your successive telegrams, we, the undersigned, departed from Hankou on the Ping-Han Railway on the morning of the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, we arrived in Zhengzhou City to inspect the dike works near Zhoujiakou, Shabukou, the bridge, and the county seat of Yancheng along the Sha River and Ying River basins. On the morning of the 16th, we arrived in Bianzhou. Upon being greeted by representatives from the Henan Provincial Government, we proceeded to Kaifeng. That evening, we boarded the Longhai Railway westward. On the morning of the 17th, we inspected the Luo River dike works in Gongxian County. In the afternoon, we arrived in Luoyang to inspect the Luoyang South Dike Works. All of the above projects were repaired by the 18th District Works Relief Bureau. The labor costs were minimal, and the benefits were immense. The stone works were all cemented, making them quite strong. According to the people of Yancheng County, since the completion of the dike works this year, over 2,000 *qing* of farmland in the Ying River basin have benefited, resulting in the first bountiful harvest since the third year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Previously, the price of each *mu* of land was less than ten yuan, but now it has risen to one hundred and twenty yuan. The people have greatly benefited from this. However, the District Works Relief Bureau, due to starting work too late, still has unfinished portions at the end of the project. Furthermore, there are many other important projects in the province that the local people have repeatedly requested to continue. It seems appropriate to carefully consider the situation and selectively manage the projects to achieve complete success. We plan to take the Longhai Railway tonight to Xu and then to Bengbu to inspect the Huai River project in Anhui Province. We hereby submit this report on the inspection of various projects in Henan Province for your review and consideration. The Dike Works Inspection Group: Wen Lanting, Zhou Xiangxian, Li Zushen, Wu Renzhe, Shen Baixian, Lu Yi, Li Mengping, Pan Zeji, Yun Yiqun, Zhu Yunguang, Wang Yinping, Stloebel Yorke, and all members respectfully submit.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks Opinions on Partnership Withdrawal</h3>
<p>No Regulations in Civil Code Regarding Partnership Withdrawal Procedures</p>
<p>Letter Sent to Various Trades to Express Opinions Fully</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that due to the lack of proper withdrawal procedures for partnerships in the city's partnership stores, various disputes often arise after partners withdraw mid-term. Therefore, the Chamber has specifically sent a letter to various trade associations to solicit opinions and practices on partnership withdrawal. The original letter states: "It has been observed that in our country, most stores are organized as partnerships. Moreover, money lenders place great emphasis on the credit and assets of the partners. Therefore, the withdrawal of a partner, especially one with significant assets and credit, often affects the interests of creditors and raises questions of liability after withdrawal. Creditors often argue that without procedures such as endorsement, amendment, and public notice, the withdrawal cannot be asserted against third parties. While the Civil Code addresses the terms of withdrawal and the issue of liability after withdrawal (limited to debts incurred by the partnership before the withdrawal), it does not specify whether public notice is a necessary procedure. The intention of the relevant clauses is that liability for debts incurred by the partnership before the withdrawal remains, even after public notice. The issue arises with debts incurred by the partnership after the withdrawal; whether such debts can be considered valid if the withdrawal was not publicly announced. According to the principle that if there is no legal provision, custom should be followed, the crucial question is whether endorsement, amendment, and public notice can be considered customs in this city. The establishment of a custom requires both subjective and objective elements: (1) it must be believed by the general public, and (2) there must be continuous and widespread facts. Although some trades practice endorsement, amendment, and registration, the general public does not consider them necessary, so they cannot yet be regarded as customs. Furthermore, partnership stores rely on the credit and assets of the partners, similar to unlimited liability companies. Shareholders of unlimited liability companies must apply to the authorities for registration when withdrawing shares. Therefore, unless proper procedures are established and uniformly applied by all trades for partners withdrawing from partnerships, various disputes will inevitably arise in the future, leading to conflicting views. Consequently, the seventh executive committee meeting resolved to: (1) solicit information from various trades about the customs of partnership withdrawal, and (2) determine proper procedures to be followed for mid-term withdrawals to prevent future disputes. A corresponding record is hereby enclosed for your review and research. Please express your opinions fully and return them to the Chamber by January 15, 1933, for consideration."</p>
<h3>Shanghai North District Fire Brigade Urges Allocation of Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhabei Fire Brigade Joint Association and various fire brigades have been suffering greatly since the restoration, due to the difficulty in claiming the original monthly funds from the Public Security Bureau each time. The accumulated wages of firefighters, the expenses for repairing vehicles and equipment damaged in the war, are all urgently needed. The various brigades are already struggling to cope. Yesterday, they convened a meeting of all fire brigades to discuss the situation, feeling that it was increasingly unbearable. The brigades then elected representatives, who, along with a formal petition, went to the Municipal Government to appeal. Secretary-General Wang received them and stated that the temporary fire-fighting expenses for each war zone had indeed been approved, but due to the emptiness of the municipal treasury, the funds had not been allocated. He acknowledged that the difficulties presented by the brigades were genuine and promised to inform the Finance Bureau to allocate the funds within this year and to ensure that the monthly regular fees would be allocated within a week, specifying a date for future collections to avoid further difficulties. The brigade representatives were satisfied and returned to their respective brigades.</p>

<h3>Yun Case Appeal Judgment</h3>
<p>Sentence of Three Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yun Huifang, a member of the "Blood Soul" group, was charged because her comrade Cai Yaozu threw a bomb into the Yongchang Coal Company, owned by the traitorous merchant Wu, who sold Japanese coal on Xinza Road on the morning of July 28, causing minor injuries to the employee Yu Ruiliang’s thigh. She was suspected of being an accomplice. The Public Concession Police Department brought Yun before the Second Special District Court. After investigation, the First Special District Court sentenced Yun to three months imprisonment. Yun immediately declared her dissatisfaction and, through her lawyer, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, listing various reasons for a reversal. The Second Branch of the High Court held two hearings to gather witness testimony and concluded its research. Yesterday, at 2:00 PM, the verdict was announced. Yun Huifang, who had already been released on bail, did not appear despite being summoned. None of her three defense lawyers were present. Only Li Zhishan, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, and the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case arrived on time. Subsequently, Criminal Tribunal President Yu Hua, along with judges Guo and Cai, and the prosecutor and clerk, entered the courtroom and called for the appellant Yun Huifang, but there was no response. President Yu then announced the main text of the judgment: the original judgment regarding the main sentence and commutation was overturned. Yun Huifang was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for harming someone using methods sufficient to cause death or serious injury. The number of days detained before the judgment was finalized will be converted to imprisonment at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. The other parts of the original verdict were dismissed.</p>
<h3>Many Charity Race Tickets Sold</h3>
<p>Various Banks and Organizations Request to Sell Tickets on Commission</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the Shanghai International Charity Horse Race is issuing lottery tickets, with 25% of the proceeds going to relief efforts in the disaster area north of Shanghai.

It has also been reported that various banks and organizations, such as the Sino-French Savings Society and the Pudong Bank, have been contacting the Finance Bureau to discuss acting as commission agents, which the authorities have approved.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jinji Thermos Bottles Are Not Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>First Rejected for Membership by the Trade Association</p>
<p>Then Expelled from the Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>A Guowen News Agency report states that Zhao Jinyuan, from Pudong, operates the Zhao Jinji Thermos Bottle Factory at 424 Oujiali, Oujia Road, Hongkou. He produces various sizes of Jinshi brand thermos bottles and has achieved considerable success. However, his factory lacks the equipment and workers to manufacture thermos bottles. All of his products are purchased from the Jinlong Thermos Bottle Factory, established by a Japanese man named Guantian. After Zhao Jinji relabels them, they are sold by the Jinhua store on Laobeimen Street to various ports, both domestically and internationally, achieving widespread sales and significant profits. Recently, Zhao Jinji placed advertisements in major newspapers, offering low-priced gifts and claiming to be a member of the Mechanical Industry Association and the National Goods Factory Joint Association. The National Goods Factory has issued a statement denying this and, after investigating, found him to be highly suspicious, publicly denouncing him and urging everyone to reject him. However, Zhao Jinyuan has shown no remorse, fully demonstrating his ability to deceive the Chinese people. Recently, when the Shanghai West National Goods Mobile Exhibition opened, Zhao Jinji also attempted to participate, hoping to deceive society. However, the organizers of the exhibition discovered this and expelled him yesterday, as a warning to shameless merchants. It is reported that the Thermos Bottle Trade Association is paying close attention to this matter and has rejected his application for membership.</p>

<h3>Re-election of Officers for the Leprosy Association's Women's Support Group</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Support Group of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held its final regular meeting of the year yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM at the residence of Mrs. Xiao Zhiji.

<h3>Adjournment of the Liu Chongwu Case Trial</h3>
<p>In recent months, Liu Chongwu and others have followed in the footsteps of Yun Huifang, using drastic measures to deal with unscrupulous merchants in the city, resulting in the tragedy of shooting and injuring people. The police authorities believe that this greatly hinders public security and have ordered all police stations to conduct strict investigations. Liu and others were subsequently arrested one after another. After repeated investigations, in addition to releasing those who were not involved, the Public Works Department filed a lawsuit against Liu and seven others in the First Special District Court. The trial was originally scheduled to be heard by Judge Qian Wenji yesterday afternoon. The lawyers defending the defendants, including Chen Tingrui, appeared in court one after another. However, due to certain reasons, the court adjourned the trial for the sake of prudence. At the same time, it notified the police station to ensure that the prisoners were brought to court. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this case will be heard this year.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice of the Kidnappers in the Liu Nianchun Case Captured</h3>
<p>Liu Nianchun, the owner of Dingkang Gold Shop on Tianjin Road, was kidnapped in the autumn of the year before last. After the case was solved, several kidnappers were arrested and executed. Recently, Yang Asi, a native of Tongzhou who was the lookout for the case, was arrested by the Chief Inspectorate of the General Police Station. After repeated investigations by Chinese detectives Lu Liankui and Liu Shaokui, Yang confessed that his accomplice, Zhuang Longhai, was hiding in the Yangshupu area. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, Lu and Liu led detectives Xie Futang and detectives from the west to rush to the address to arrest him. Zhuang was arrested near the intersection of Pingliang Road and Shenglu Road. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi questioned him. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that since Zhuang was Yang's accomplice and the investigation was still ongoing, he requested an adjournment so that the case could be tried together with Yang's. Judge Wu briefly questioned Zhuang and ordered him to be detained for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Widow's Remarriage Leads to Trouble with Hoodlums</h3>
<p>Husband Injured by Beatings</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaomei, a local woman, is 29 years old and lives in a bungalow on Pingliang Road. Her husband, Zhou Jinfu, died of illness in October, leaving her with nothing. Xiaomei found it difficult to make ends meet and, being young, could not remain celibate. She planned to remarry someone reliable to ensure her future livelihood. A fellow villager, Zhou Yuangou, only 24 years old, was unmarried and worked in a yarn factory. His monthly salary of about twenty or thirty yuan could support a household. Through an introduction, he and Xiaomei agreed to marry, and they began living together early this month. However, tragedy struck when Zhou Jinfu's relative, Xu, a local tanner who associated with hoodlums, learned of the marriage. He went to Xiaomei's house to cause trouble, asking why, after her husband's death,</p>
<h3>Citizens Petition the Municipal Government Against Telephone Rate Hikes</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Citizens' Association, in opposition to the concession's telephone rate increases, sent two representatives, Ji Jiannan and Shi Zongtang, to the Municipal Government with a petition yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them. After the representatives explained the petition, Secretary-General Yu replied that the case had been entrusted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for review and had been reported to the government. He will order Zheng Baocheng, the chief of the bureau who originally handled the case, to come to the government tomorrow (today) to discuss it further and then report it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing, so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. The representatives were satisfied and left. The original petition is recorded below: Respectfully, we have repeatedly petitioned your government to promptly protest and legally correct the telephone rate increase in the concession and sent representatives to present our petitions. We received your Secretary-General Yu's personal instruction that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities had been ordered to review it. Yesterday, the association sent two representatives, Ji Jiannan and Shi Zongtang, to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to request a prompt review so that the dispute could be resolved as soon as possible. Chief Zheng Baocheng replied that the case had been reviewed and submitted to your government for approval. The case has been delayed for months, and the dispute is growing. If it is not resolved soon, it will inevitably develop into a major incident. In addition to sending the two representatives, Ji Jiannan and Shi Zongtang, to present the case in person, we are sending another letter for your approval to grant our request to ensure social stability. We are deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>less than three months, she should not immediately beat people. Xiaomei believed that Xu was interfering with her remarriage, which led to disagreements and separation. Xu harbored resentment and planned revenge. On the 12th, at about 2:00 PM, he gathered more than ten hoodlums and broke into [Zhou's] house. Xiaomei and Yuangou were both present. Xu made things difficult for them, saying, "You married a widow without spending a penny. How can you get such a cheap deal? You must pay three thousand yuan, or else you will regret it."

<h3>News from Various Hometown Associations</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Hometown Associations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Wuhan had previously established a joint office of Sichuan Hometown Associations abroad in Beijing. Yesterday, representatives of the Shanghai Association 鍾行素, Tianjin representatives 王藻華, Wuhan representatives 殷仲橋, and Nanjing representatives 朱國定 carried a petition to the Three People's Principles Association: (1) The Central Government should enforce the Seventeen-Year Governance Program in Sichuan and issue an order to end the war within a specified time limit, and those who violate it will be investigated and punished. (2) The Central Government should punish the perpetrators of the Sichuan war. (3) The Central Government should strictly prohibit soldiers from entering Sichuan. (4) Release Wang Aoxi, who has worked for the Party and the country in Sichuan. (5) Establish a Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee, organized by the Central Government with the participation of civilian groups, with no military participation. (6) Establish a Sichuan Army Legacy Association. (7) Convene a Provincial People's Congress. The General Secretary of the Congress, Ye Chucang, met with them. 鍾行素 handed over the petition and explained the reasons. The representatives also added detailed explanations. Ye replied that the entire petition was to the point and was not different from the Central Government's current plan to govern Sichuan. The Wang case will also be handled according to law. However, to stop the Sichuan war by force, it is necessary to send troops to Sichuan. Some people may mistakenly believe that this is an extension of the civil war. Zhong continued to say that the Central Government is to punish the perpetrators and is not comparable to the melee of equal warlords. If the Sichuan turmoil is not stopped decisively this time, the war will be prolonged, and the Sichuan people will either die in the rain of bullets or be killed by whippings. Ye replied that the seven points in the petition and the supplementary statements were all appropriate and will be submitted to the Congress for combined discussion. After the resolution, a written reply will be sent at a later date. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 21st, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Tingsong, and Hu Xisheng hosted a banquet for the team leaders of the Shaoxing Hometown Association at the Yijia Chun Western Restaurant. The host, Wang Xiaolai, stood up and announced the purpose of the banquet, saying that the Hometown Association is a large family for the people of Shaoxing. Today's banquet is like a common meal for the family. To make the family prosperous, all family members must work hard and help each other. Therefore, he hopes that the team leaders will work harder to prosper this large family. Wang Yansong said that the greatest purpose of the Hometown Association is to help those who have power to help those who have no power so that those who have no power also have power and can help each other, so that the entire power can be obtained. Finally, Hu Xisheng and Pei Yunqing said that the Hometown Association is a living group of people from Shaoxing, and the Yongxi Hall Association is a dead group of people from Shaoxing. Now the roots of the dead group are consolidated, and the living group is more important than the dead group. We should make extra efforts to help consolidate it. Then, the team leaders reported on their solicitation results, and the executive committee members expressed their opinions. It was decided to improve several important cases of the association. The guests and hosts parted happily.</p>

<h3>Occupation and Society</h3>
<p>(1) Discussion on the question raised by Mr. Weng</p>
<p>丨Original letter see the 19th of this month丨</p>
<p>Zhu Yingjun's letter: The reporter replied to Mr. Weng's letter, saying: "If you can't be the principal, the whole family can go to work. As long as you can endure hardship, you will never starve to death! If you think it is shameful to work, then your own thoughts are falling, and we have no way to do it." The words are very right, but under the current entire social and economic situation, taking Shanghai alone, I don't know how many original workers have lost their jobs? Weng Jun is a weak scholar, and his whole family has never worked before. What kind of work can they do? Which factory is willing to hire them? I have seen many people who have graduated from universities or have been officials. They are very willing to work with their wives, and they have taken off their long gowns and suits and put on workers' clothes, but either the factories do not add people, or they do not want novices. As for saying? "As long as you can endure hardship, you will never starve to death." I want to ask again: "The old people in Shaanxi and Gansu... which one is not more than twelve points more able to endure hardship than us, but why did so many people starve to death? Let me say another sentence: If a certain university graduate wants to work as an extremely low-level worker in your newspaper, with a solid guarantee, can your newspaper accommodate him? Please answer the above questions.</p>
<p>Reply: We think that the questions raised in the letter are very meaningful. However, in our last reply to Mr. Weng, we once said this: "This is actually a whole social problem, and it is difficult to provide individual relief. Therefore, your letter asks us to give a complete answer. We don't have a way, but it is a long story, and the result is still unable to solve your immediate needs." Therefore, we never knew that this was a "whole society" problem, we never knew the difficulty of finding a job in the current society, we never knew the old people in Shaanxi and Gansu, they were "able to endure hardship", but the result was still "starving to death". The words we answered to Mr. Weng were to hope that Mr. Weng would, before the whole social problem was solved, use his own ability to find a way to treat his feet when they hurt and his head when it hurt. Naturally, we are not satisfied with this method, but we cannot let people sit and wait, and not solve the personal problems until the whole social problem is solved. If you must ask us to set a fundamental solution, we can answer you that there are already many scholars who are studying how to reform the social system, right? As for your question: If "a certain university graduate wants to work as an extremely low-level worker in this newspaper, with a solid guarantee, can this newspaper accommodate him?" I also want to ask you first, in the current society, are there only one unemployed person like a certain university student? If there is only one person, we can answer "accommodate" without hesitation. If there is more than one person, there are hundreds of thousands or even tens of thousands of people, then our answer is undoubtedly "no", because using a chariot to help the crowd, although it is said to be a happy thing, but what if the "crowd" cannot "help"?</p>
<p>(2) Discussion on the question raised by Mr. Bao Zhizheng</p>
<p>丨Original letter see the 17th of this month丨</p>
<p>Fu Kebai's letter: (1) Because of the darkness of this entire political system, we can only unite everyone and refuse to pay "black fees". If the Public Security Bureau takes further measures to impose oppression, then everyone must recognize that we cannot be safe unless we overthrow this dark organization! Naturally, the fundamental way is to transform this social system to be useless. (2) This kind of occupation is fundamentally a way, but in the current situation of China's rural economic bankruptcy, if we want to find a new way out, Bao Jun can only use the spirit of self-awareness to make universal propaganda to the 90 people in the same industry and even the vast number of oppressed people, and turn this miserable life into a lively revolutionary path. .</p>
<p>(3) Discussion on the question raised by Mr. Wu Sijing</p>
<p>丨Original letter see the 17th of this month丨</p>
<p>(1) Jiang Cun Song's letter: The reasons why a few people can have food to eat without relying on their knowledge and ability are: (1) liking flattery, (2) loving to save face, (3) taking care of private feelings, (4) not having a long-term vision, (5) lacking the ability to identify; on the part of the employed, (1) being good at flattering, (2) being good at adapting, (3) climbing to the powerful, (4) not having integrity. The reason why most honest and frank people with considerable skills to make a living have food to eat is that they do not have the above reasons, and there are more general reasons, that is, there are more monks than porridge, there are fewer people who are willing to start a business, and there are more people who want to eat ready-made food.</p>
<p>(2) Fu Kebai's letter: Because society is in the hands of these few people, most people cannot get food to eat despite having the skills to make a living. Wu Jun and even the unemployed in general do have the right to demand that society provide them with work, but if you don't transform this society, who will listen to your demands! Friends, society is dead, and it always needs human power to push it around!</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office Sends Personnel to Urge Borrowing</h3>
<p>Half-month fee notice issued</p>
<p>But still short of 100,000 in cash</p>
<p>More than 30 representatives from various schools attending the Temporary Full-Power Representative Assembly of the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Teachers and Staff Association, because the Jiangsu Finance Department owes 3 million yuan in provincial education expenses (more than 1.9 million yuan in owed expenses from counties before May 19, more than 700,000 yuan owed after the division in May, and 365,000 yuan owed in provincial subsidies in the 19th and 20th years, totaling the above numbers), and the Education Expense Management Office recently telegraphed to prepay half of the new arrears (365,000) to meet emergency needs, but has not yet made a firm statement, specially met with Yang Zishen, section chief of the Management Office, and took a car from Nanjing to Zhenjiang on the morning of the 19th. After gathering at Zhenjiang Middle School, they went to the Finance Department in the afternoon, met with the Director of Finance, and discussed until late, but did not get a penny. Director Yang went to the Finance Department again on the 20th, but did not get anything important. The Management Office originally planned to raise funds in three ways: (1) urging the Finance Department to pay arrears, (2) urging loans from various counties, and (3) borrowing from banks. They hoped that the Finance Department would at least pay more than 100,000 yuan from the new arrears of 365,000 yuan, so as to raise cash for two and a half months for provincial schools. Now that they have suffered this blow, they do not know how to make things right. It is heard that the Management Office has issued notices of expenses for the second half of August to provincial secondary schools and social education institutions, and expenses for the second half of October to teachers' schools and experimental primary schools (teachers' schools and experimental primary schools have always been advanced, so they are issued until October). The date for the payment notice is filled in as December 25. The half-month expenses of each school and institution are calculated to be 124,500 yuan. Currently, the Management Office only has more than 20,000 yuan in stock. Therefore, although the notice has been issued, there are still five days until the 25th, and there is still a shortage of 100,000 yuan in cash. During these few days, special efforts must be made to raise funds. It is heard that Section Chief Hua Beihe of the Management Office is scheduled to go to Wujin and Wujiang counties on the 21st to urge loans (Wujin previously lent 50,000 yuan, but has not borrowed a penny so far, Wujiang lent 60,000 yuan, and has remitted 15,000 yuan. It is hoped that these two places will be handled as previously agreed), in order to raise 100,000 yuan by the 25th, so that each school can receive the expenses on time.</p>

From the score of 56 to 17, Shanghai University's Qian and Feng forwards and defender Sun Shiqing leave the court, and Shi Jiaju, Zou Qiyu, and Yuan Wu fill in, and the combat power is slightly reduced. Zhijiang's entire army is launched, and Wang Pusheng and Zhang Guowei repeatedly make achievements. Chen Yaosheng and Fan Guoxiong respond in the back, and the lineup is consolidated, with no weaknesses. At this point, Shanghai University can only resist and cannot attack.

<h3>The Philippines Also Strives for the Far Eastern Games in Two Years</h3>
<p>|Early Opening of the Carnival|</p>
<p>(Manila Dispatch) Japan is preparing for the Far Eastern Games in two years. The Philippine Sports Association, in order to wash away the shame of finishing fourth in the last Far Eastern Games and to prepare for the tenth Far Eastern Games to be held in Manila in two years, has now decided to open the 1933 Carnival early on February 4 (the official session is in mid-February). The reason for the early opening is that the Philippine Association requires the expansion of various sports programs in the Carnival to awaken the attention of the people of the entire Philippine Islands to sports. In addition to various sacrificial programs and election programs in the conference, the sports programs should be all-inclusive, including track and field, swimming, football, basketball, volleyball, netball, baseball, boxing, wrestling, bicycle racing, etc. Netball will be expanded, and famous netball players from various parts of Southeast Asia will be invited to participate in the Philippines to promote the past achievements of Philippine players in netball competitions. The netball competition of the Carnival has begun to reserve seats, and tickets are divided into three types: ten pesos, three pesos, and one peso (note: peso is the name of the Philippine currency).</p>

<p>Sixty-Eight Competitors Start</p>
<p>A total of sixty-eight athletes participated in the competition, lined up west of the Jinan University office building, next to the faculty dormitory on a stone road. At the time, the north wind was blowing strongly, and the cold air was biting. The athletes rubbed their fists and prepared themselves, full of vigor. Upon hearing the starter Hao Chunde's command, they sprinted north, leaving Jinan University through the back gate and entering the desolate fields, stumbling along and fighting against the north wind, striving for the championship.</p>
<p>Zhan Yiji Wins First Place</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Accelerate Forward</h3>
<p>Urgent Rumors of War Debt to Be Repaid</p>
<p>Increase Reaches 10 Taels and 7 Mace</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, a Reuters telegram reported a slight drop of 0.0621. The US dollar bank exchange rate remained high, rising by 1 to 1.5 points. American cotton was slightly lower by 1 to 2 pounds. However, the overdue silver price fell by more than 1 li, reaching 22 li. A private telegram also reported a slight decrease of 0.1875, which was barely satisfactory. The opening price was 807 taels and 8 mace, slightly higher than the previous closing price by 1 tael and 6 mace. Banks quoted near-term British exchange rates at 1 shilling and 8 pence, and the US exchange rate at 27.875 yuan, which was the same as the previous closing price. British exchange rates were tight, and US exchange rates were at par. Therefore, the market situation was calm, fluctuating up and down entirely due to user and goods support. Later, due to Jinfeng and Yongfu’s slight advancement, it rose from 7 taels and 1 mace to 8 taels and 7 mace. Citibank offered February US dollars at 93.75. Yuyuanmao, Yongzhifeng, and Yonglai sold back to 7 taels and 2 mace. Dongya bought January US dollars at 81.25. Yongfeng and Yifeng bought paper, rising to 9 taels and 7 mace. Yifa and Yong and others sold slightly, while Dadecheng and others advanced slightly. Therefore, at this time, only the numbers fluctuated, with support outside of 10 taels. At 9:30 AM, HSBC posted prices without any movement, and people's hearts turned downward, dropping to 9 taels and 2 mace. However, after this, the banking market tightened. January US exchange rates were at 81.25, and March at 28 yuan. Banks wanted to settle. Dadecheng took the stage to advance, rising to 11 taels and a half. However, each firm’s transactions were not significant, so there were often several cash spreads. When the news came that the posted price had been reduced by 125, it rose to 2 taels. Mecali sold January US dollars at 81.25. Yifa and Fengyong resold in the market, falling to within 10 taels. Tianfengyong and others came to advance, so it rebounded. Zhengjin ate US exchange rates for this month at 75. Hengxing, Zhifengyong absorbed paper, adding up to 2 taels and 6 mace. Goods were cashed out for 1 tael and 5 mace. Futaiheng bought in, reaching outside of 2 taels. After this, Bingxing increased its long positions, and Yuan Fengyong also advanced, plus China's advancing March US dollars at 875, and there was news that war debts were determined to be paid off. The market was extremely strong, at 1, 3 taels or more, reaching 5 taels and a half. Because users spat out, it dropped to 4 taels and 4 mace. After this, there was suddenly news that Hengyu opened 1,050 spot contracts on behalf of the central bank, and people's hearts were invigorated. Fuluyong and others dragged in, rising again by 3 taels, to 18 taels. Suddenly, this news was not confirmed, and the market did not have tighter transactions, so it retreated to 16 taels and 9 mace at closing. Goods were slightly higher, at 7 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 10 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>Posted Price Less Suppressed by 7 Taels Because the posted price was reduced by 125, the posted price was 872 taels, 7 mace, and 3 fen. According to the closing price, it was approximately suppressed by 55 taels, a decrease of 7 taels compared to the previous day. The highest price for the day was 818 taels, and the lowest price was 807 taels and 1 mace. December registration was 818 taels, and January and February were both 817 taels. The supplementary price was 815 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions First Out, Then In The city's transactions were generally first out and then in. In the market, Hengxing, Fuchang, Futaiheng, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Fuyu, Jinfengyong, Tianfengyong, Tongtaichang, Zhifengyong, etc., all advanced. Yifeng sold a small number. Rendecheng, Hengyu, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, etc., were first out and then in. Qingfayong, Shunliyifengyong, Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang, advanced first and then out. Bingxing increased its positions, advancing about 700 or 800 contracts.</p>
<p>Clam Red Transactions Extremely Light Clam Red is still calculated at 7 taels and a half to 8 taels. The transaction was very small. At 8 taels, each silver shop sold about 200 taels. The market is tepid.</p>

January to February was offered by Jingfu to Ru Changyu for 8 contracts, with Jingfu offering 1 tael and 2 mace. December to February was offered by Qianchangxiang for 1 tael and 7 mace to Hengxing, swapping 70 contracts. The atmosphere is trending towards dullness. The number of January contracts that have not been settled has now decreased to over 2,000.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Rates Are Tight, Both Openly and Covertly</h3>
<p>The exchange market’s British exchange rate also fell due to the reduction in large contracts. The New York silver price did not move. The opening price of the US dollar was slightly flat. Distant contracts and private contracts were all small, so the market trended towards tightening after opening. HSBC posted prices without movement first to observe the situation due to exchange rate considerations. However, the exchange market did not pay attention. Businessmen shorted shillings. Oriental merchants continued to settle US dollars fiercely, trending towards showing profit, and then reduced British and American exchange rates by 125 each. The gold price therefore became higher. Bill banks were still waiting for a good price to sell. British exchange rates were being shorted by businessmen to 1 shilling and 8 pence in April. As a result, British exchange rates shrank by a huge 3125 compared to the previous closing. American exchange rates have a recap of 1871 for both morning and afternoon sessions after going up 25 points.</p>
<p>British Exchange Market Recap Near-term 1 shilling and 8 pence 0625, tighter by 121 compared to the previous closing. Mecali first ate March 1875.

Qipan Gen exited March 0625. Huabi exited. Zhengjin ate November 9375. Mecali Zhejiang exited April 1 shilling and 8 pence. At noon, the near-term (December and January) asking price was 1 shilling and 7 pence 8125, the bid price was 875, and the overdue (February and March) asking price was 875, and the bid price was 9375.</p>
<p>American exchange rates were stable because the silver price did not move and the morning opening was equal to the previous closing price of 1875. In January, the upper market immediately made 9375, which was offered by Citibank and bought by Mitsui. In March, it was released by Nijin at 0625. Zhongfu exited, and Huabi advanced January 875.

<p>The actual demand for cotton yarn [illegible], the situation is clear [illegible], all gangs are lifeless, generally because the end of the year is approaching and the finances are getting tighter, so transactions are lacking. However, the situation in the yarn bidding market fluctuates, with gold [illegible] mixed in, making it difficult to grasp. With the trend of rising cotton, the sluggish and uninspiring yarn is carried higher. Moreover, general speculators tend to [illegible] to do more, preparing for the red market in the spring, hoping to rise [illegible]. The fundamental problem is still to consider the actual sales.</p>
<p>There are speculators doing more in the man-made bidding The opening of the pre-market for man-made bidding was extremely flat. Later, with the firm raw cotton, the market was slightly higher, with each up 2.45 qian. In the afternoon, I heard that the etiquette money was high again, and the market became tighter. Retail investors made up the difference. The cotton market rose sharply in the second and third rounds, and the yarn market tightened. Each month rose 6, 8, 9 qian to 1 tael. The total number of transactions for the day was 24,100 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 850 bales, Yongchang 400 bales, Changfeng 350 bales, and Shenchang 400 bales. Jifeng bought 750 bales, Senkang 550 bales, Shenji 850 bales, Dachang 650 bales, Shenchang 450 bales, and Yuantai 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The financial tightness near the end of the year affects yarn sales The disposal of the existing yarn is still sluggish.

<p>Changsha 20 Mainland 44 Guangdong 10 Counterpart 50 Jiangxi 12 Nanyang 41 Anqing 25 Shantou 45 Datong 5 Ningbo 25</p>
<h3>Gold Rush Pushes Up the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quite strong, with the general idea that it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. General speculators, with the idea that the stock of cotton flowers in various factories is weak, and the combined price of foreign cotton is difficult to communicate, and the exchange rate is firm, therefore buy in and do more in a single-minded manner. In the afternoon, there was a rumor in the business market that a certain manufacturer had done a good job of goods in Tianjin, Shandong, and the producing areas, and was deeply afraid of not being able to come to Shanghai. In addition, the gold market is trending higher, and buyers are particularly active in absorbing and buying in. In short, the world is still in an era of cotton [illegible] surplus. At present, according to market calculations, American cotton must be combined at about 36 taels to come to Shanghai, and the benchmark cotton price is 33 taels and 8 qian, a difference of 2 taels and 2 qian. However, the generally optimistic sentiment is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Scattered Shorts Competing to Cover The Zheng Biao pre-market opened with a slight drop in US cotton, and people's hearts were still at peace. Later, with the rise in the gold market, the field fell [illegible]</p>
<p>Small retail investors in the market offset, and each month rose by 5 fen to 1 qian and a half. In the afternoon, I heard that the gold market closed at 817 taels and 5 qian, and the atmosphere in the market became more prosperous. Scattered shorts offset, and the situation became tighter. Moreover, it was rumored that there was a large amount of trading in [illegible] cotton, with a part of the air acting as a function. Each month rose by 1 qian and 5 fen to 2 qian and a half. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 67,400 dan. It was found that Yuanda sold 5,700 dan, Changfeng 5,200 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Shenchang 3,300 dan, Yukang 1,800 dan, Sui [illegible] 2,300 dan, and Tonghe 1,600 dan.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Unanimously Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton futures were bought up by local traders, strengthening initially.  Later, due to the slump on Wall Street and profit-taking by bulls, they weakened. Futures fell one to two points.  Spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures fell slightly, spot prices fell eleven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell twelve points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to the arrival of Oomra cotton.  Later, due to purchases by Japanese merchants and favorable harvesting conditions for bulls, it strengthened.  Calculated in rupees: Bengals fell one rupee, Oomras fell 2.5 rupees, White Broach fell 0.75 rupees.  (Original telegraph from the 20th)</p>

<h3>Grains and Flour Prices Surge Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued to be brisk, and the market was extremely tight. Futures prices for all goods rose uniformly. Spot flour was extremely scarce, and factories had already raised prices to 2.05 taels, with no large quantities available. Delivery of completed orders was being pushed to January and February. Customers were still actively seeking goods. The mid- to long-term market saw fierce competition between bulls and bears, leading to an unexpected surge. At the opening of the market in the morning, foreign wheat was quoted slightly lower, at 0.2 taels. Canadian wheat was traded at 2,000 tons at a price of 3.5 taels. Australian wheat from Nanjing was not negotiated for at a price of 3.4 taels. At that time, the mood was calm and prices were soft.

<h3>Fujian Guild Continues to Purchase Kehsien Rice</h3>
<p>| Foreign Rice Stock at 440,000 Bags |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fujian guild had an active appetite for Kehsien rice. Local traders were willing to sell, but because river rice could be re-exported and was cheaper, they shifted their attention to that. Trading in Kehsien rice was temporarily on hold. However, the Fujian guild was not interested in river rice and focused on Kehsien and Keyuan rice. Yesterday, they bought 408 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice at prices ranging from 9.65 to 9.40 taels, 300 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice at 8.10 taels, and 200 bags of machine-milled oil rice at 8.62 taels. The market situation was similar to the previous day. Red rice was purchased by Quanzhou, while the rest was purchased by Fuzhou. The rice inventory stored in Shanghai was 445,000 bags, all owned by the British firms Jardine Matheson and Ewo. The floating supply on the market had been exhausted, so there were no sales.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>On Tuesday (20th), Chicago wheat initially fell due to weakness in the Liverpool market, but then rose due to purchases from the East. The total trading volume on the 19th was 10 million bushels. The daily market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December  44.000  Down 0.250</p>
<p>May  46.000  Down 0.375</p>
<p>July  46.125  Down 0.625</p>

<h3>Sugar Market, Domestic Raw Sugar Market Both Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was quite active in trading, and the trend was firm. In the morning, Changxing offered 1,400 bags of Grade 24 white sugar at 15.5 taels. In the afternoon, the guild made a good offer of 0.05 taels, at 15.55 taels, but the traders did not bite, resulting in no transactions. Eight hundred oil bags of Dutch red sugar were offered, priced at 11.5 taels. The Xinchao Raw Sugar firm continued to offer goods, with a total of 600-700 bags traded at prices ranging from 8.85 to 8.5 taels, only 0.05 taels higher or lower than on the 13th, and the trend was stable. Due to the relatively large inventory of slab sugar and lower market prices, the price was 8.2-8.3 taels. Brick sugar trading was limited, with prices around 8 taels. The Xinzhang firm's offer and bid prices did not align, so no transactions were made. However, the market outlook is not good, and long-term inaction will hinder the source market.</p>
<p>Also received a New York sugar market report: spot prices are still calculated at 8.125 cents per pound, futures prices are up 3 points for December/May, down 1 point for January, up 2 points for March, and up 1 point for July/September. The London and Java sugar markets remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Sesame Nails Fixed at 1,000 Boxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London telegram: The fixed price for sesame nails is 31 shillings per box, with 1,000 boxes made. It is said that this transaction was handled by the firms of Ward and Yongxing.</p>
<h3>Hardware Merchants Head North in Succession</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold, and the northern ports are freezing, so the shipment of hardware to Tianjin, Yantai, and other ports in the north is decreasing daily. Moreover, with the approaching end of the year, merchants from various ports are preparing to wrap up business. Therefore, there are several instances each day of merchants packing up and heading north. As for the merchants from Sichuan and other areas upstream along the Yangtze River, the river is drying up, and frequent warfare makes trading difficult, so many are also returning west. Therefore, recent trading in the local market, except for manufacturers making small adjustments, large-scale transactions are as rare as morning stars.</p>

<h3>Lotus Drop (3)</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>He cried again, and after crying for a while, said, "What am I going to do?"</p>
<p>"Let's go together!"</p>
<p>So we walked south together, not knowing where we were going. She didn't say anything on the road, and I didn't dare to say anything either. When we arrived at a town, she said, "I'm really hungry." So I ran to a pancake shop and begged the shopkeeper, "Sir, have pity on me, I'm starving. The house was ransacked by soldiers, and I've been running for a day and a night without anything to eat." The shopkeeper acted as if he didn't hear me. I had no choice but to walk away. She was standing at the corner, waiting for me with a reproachful look on her face. I had no choice but to walk in front of a silk shop, and for some reason, I thought of Lotus Drop, so I lowered my head and sang: "Oh dear! The plum blossoms are blooming and falling, one plum blossom at a time! Winter plum blossoms!"</p>
<p>I felt my face turning red, and there were many people around me watching. I really wanted to disappear into the ground. At this moment, I suddenly heard someone singing along with me. I looked and saw it was her. I don't know where she got two broken bamboo pieces, which she held in her hand, tapping them rhythmically. I became emboldened, immediately straightened my chest, raised my head, and sang the Lotus Drop loudly. We were two people singing together.</p>
<p>From that day on, we wandered like autumn leaves, from this city to that city. Later, we also got a broken huqin (Chinese violin), so with a huqin and a clapper, together, over one mountain after another, over one river after another, in front of the thatched cottage's wooden door, in front of the black lacquered gate, we sang the Lotus Drop.</p>
<p>Last night, we were sitting in a small alley. She was feeling a little feverish, leaning against me, and looked at my hair and said, "Your hair is a bit gray too."</p>
<p>"Isn't it? I'm over forty years old, how can my hair not be white?"</p>
<p>"It's been over twenty years, almost thirty years, since we ran out of the pavilion. Time really flies! Do you remember, one year we were in Henan, and we didn't get anything to eat for three days? You were so angry at that time that you hit me for no reason, and you bruised my waist a lot! Do you remember?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you scratch my face too?"</p>
<p>"Wasn't that night in the pavilion very much like tonight?"</p>
<p>I raised my head: there was a crescent moon in the eaves, turning all the black tiles into silver.</p>
<p>"But I'm really tired!" She leaned her head on my shoulder, it was so heavy.</p>
<p>I didn't pay attention. I just kept looking at the moon. But she just died like that.</p>
<p>With a clapper and a huqin, together, over one river after another, over one mountain after another, in front of the thatched cottage's wooden door, in front of the black lacquered gate, in the street, in the wheat field, we sang the Lotus Drop together. We laughed together, cried together, sighed together, and wiped away tears together: there was a me in this world, and there was a her! We were two people.</p>
<p>Yes, we were two people, but she died last night. (The End)</p>
<h3>On the Selection of Novels</h3>
<p>— Xie Liuyi</p>
<p>(I selected a) "Model Novel" for a certain bookstore in Shanghai in the first half of the year. Each chapter has an analytical introduction. This article is intended to be used as a preface to the original book. It is now published in advance here, just to correct "Dayi One."</p>
<p>In the past, Jin Shengtan commented on Water Margin, commenting on the place where Pan Jinlian called Wu Song "Uncle, Uncle." Shengtan started counting from the first time she called out "Uncle," and counted all the way to more than thirty. The final comment was, "Writing about a lewd woman is like writing about a living lewd woman. After calling 'Uncle' thirty-nine times, she suddenly changes to using the word 'you,' which is a wonderful thought and a wonderful pen." This kind of appreciative criticism, in China, where there is not much achievement in literary criticism, still has considerable value even today. Although there are now criticisms of the "vague consciousness" type, such as "being able to grasp reality," I am afraid to say that overly general criticisms are not good. There is a writer in China who once asserted in a magazine that the young people of our country no longer write classical Chinese. Of course, this is what we have been hoping for. Articles like "Heaven and earth are the universe, and my heart truly embraces it. It has been a long time, not just a day for a hundred years..." or "Your Majesty, I have heard that those who seek the growth of trees must first..." We, standing on the principles of evolution, certainly do not believe that young people today are willing to pick up a pen and write such articles. Isn't the era moving forward? However, the fact has already proved that they cannot write the old eight-legged essays, but they are quite good at writing new eight-legged essays. For example, to describe the meaning of "many," some people, no matter where, when, or in what article, always cannot help but use the phrase "like bamboo shoots after a rain"; they always use the phrase "everything, everything" to summarize things; to explain the depth of an impression, they always use the sentence "forever engraved in the heart" in any article. My exposing this is very much suspected of "nitpicking." In the eyes of those who claim to be revolutionaries, words are of secondary importance, and the most important thing is "correct consciousness" and "upholding the interests of one's own class." However, I think that there is too much new eight-legged essay writing, which may hinder the "correctness of consciousness" and may even reduce the power of "upholding the interests of one's own class." Our hope is very simple, not only for everyone to have "correct consciousness" and "be able to uphold the interests of one's own class," but also to hope that everyone will write fewer new eight-legged essays. Do not blindly imitate others, but be able to self-reflect and create new words.</p>
<p>Everyone can appreciate the works of others, as long as they recognize the words. There is no need to analyze other people's works. Anyway, after reading it once, if the original work is good, just praise it with a sentence like "detailed description"; if the original work is not good, just scold it with a sentence like "written in a confused manner." It is a clever method to leave things unfinished in the world. Even if you want to take a work to analyze and explain its merits and demerits, everyone has their own views, and it is really difficult to force others to be the same as oneself, and it is absolutely impossible to be uniform. I don't want to be a "guidepost," my highest goal is just to write down the slightest gains from my personal appreciation of works and provide them to young people who like to read novels: to help them in terms of "words," "consciousness," and "description."</p>
<p>Opening the dictionaries of Chinese writers published in the market, there are almost enough Chinese writers to make up the number of five hundred Han people. But I only selected the works of five writers in this book. I have long braced myself and prepared for other writers to beat me and scold me. And I have already guessed the first sentence that will scold me. This sentence that scolds me is none other than "Are you short-sighted!" In fact, my eyes are not short-sighted, and I have also used binoculars to look around in this desert area. There are definitely more than five writers in China, this is a true and certain fact. However, what I am doing is the work of a "craftsman." When a craftsman chooses materials, he must consider whether they can fit his own "ink line." As a result of my selection, the works of these five writers can fit my ink line, so I am going to presume upon their works. As for the other masterpieces of other writers, let other craftsmen use them. (December 17)</p>
<h3>The Swiss Girl</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>The scenery of Switzerland, even for those who have not personally traveled there, cannot help but be fascinated by thinking about it or hearing about it; but does Switzerland have nothing else to captivate people besides the white snow of the Alps and the green waves of Lake Lucerne? Ah, no. This peaceful and quiet country, in addition to her bright mountain scenery and water colors that are everywhere, also has the strongest, most beautiful, and most romantic women who make travelers fall in love.</p>
<p>Swiss women are very romantic before marriage. What Chinese people call "romantic affairs" are almost universal in Switzerland. This magazine published an article by Mr. Wan Ju on the 5th of this month entitled "The Swiss Girl." Here are two additional stories based on what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>A farmer in a certain place in Switzerland was always lamenting that the fruits in his orchard were being stolen; one day, a foreign tourist heard him lamenting like this and asked him, "Why don't you raise a dog?" The honest farmer replied, "Then my daughters will never be able to marry." The foreigner was a little confused when he heard him say this, and asked him what he meant. He replied, "I used to raise a dog, which was very ferocious. Whenever it saw someone coming to my house, it would bark wildly, and as a result, a group of young people dared not come to peep through the windows of our house anymore."</p>
<p>There is also a village chief in a rural village, who is one of the most respected gentlemen in the local area. He often praised his woman to the people he knew. He said very proudly, "When my woman was young, no woman could compare to her, because she had the most 'Kelter'!" What this means is that no woman could spend the night with as many men as his wife. It turns out that in some parts of Switzerland, unmarried girls often spend the night with their lovers without any restraint on Saturday nights, and no one finds it strange at all.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Suicide</h3>
<p>— Qing Hao</p>
<p>"Suicide" is so terrible, but in this world, there are many people who commit suicide. Could it be that they are tired of living?</p>
<p>Here are some statistics on suicide: According to the statistics of the New York Life Insurance Company, more than 20,000 Americans committed suicide last year, that is, 20 people out of every 100,000 people committed suicide. In 1915, it accounted for 20.8, and in 1908, it accounted for 21.5. The capital of Wisconsin Province has a population of 58,000, and its suicide rate is 44.8.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the New York Department of Health, there were 1,500 suicides in New York last year, an increase of 97 people compared with 1930. Three-quarters of them committed suicide using the following methods:</p>
<p>Tool Male Female</p>
<p>Poisonous gas 408 169</p>
<p>Hanging 152 22</p>
<p>Jumping off a building 93 9</p>
<p>Handgun 89 4</p>
<p>Poison 66 56</p>
<p>Knives 47 5</p>
<p>According to a survey released by the German Bureau of Statistics, the number of suicides last year reached 18,000, that is, at least 30 people out of every 100,000 people committed suicide. In the first four months of 1932 alone, the number of suicides in Berlin reached 700. Japan is militaristic and its economic panic is more severe than that of other countries, so the number of suicides is also higher than that of other countries. According to the Cabinet Bureau of Statistics, the average number of suicides in Japan is 58 per day. From January to April this year, there were 694 suicides, of which women accounted for one-third, and most of them were between 21 and 25 years old.</p>
<h3>New Scientific Weapons (3)</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The third type of terrifying new weapon is the killing ray and the strangeness ray. These two rays were already making a lot of noise in the world at the end of the Great War. Later, France's Heraclius, Italy's Verifi, and Britain's Matthews all devoted themselves to studying the effectiveness of this ray, which can injure people and horses, prevent the operation of tanks and airplanes, and cause long-distance gunpowder depots to explode suddenly. If these two rays are once used as new weapons, then all modern military equipment will completely lose its value. But most people in the world do not believe in the effectiveness of these two rays. They say that this is nothing more than "bragging or" "a fable."</p>
<p>In fact, these two rays are both composed of extremely short radio waves, which is a credible fact. Whether it is a person or a horse, when touched by this ray, a strong heating effect will occur in its organs or cells, and the severity of the injury will vary depending on the length of the "wavelength" touched. This has been tested on animals and is very accurate. Therefore, these two rays are recognized as new weapons. Other weapons, such as dazzling rays, killing rays, and killing sound waves, are also monsters on future military equipment, which can be mentioned in passing here. Killing sound waves were discovered by Professors Wood and Lewis of Johns Hopkins University in the United States. A special electrical machine is used to increase the frequency of radio waves to 100,000 to several hundred thousand vibrations per second, and then these sound waves are used to kill several people. This high-frequency sound wave cannot be heard by the ear and is called "silent sound wave." Animals that are vibrated by this sound wave die in a state of dementia.</p>
<p>According to the opinions expressed by the discoverers, this sound wave causes the death of the organism because it resonates with the various cell tissues of the organism. The discoverers have tested fish and frogs in the water and have obtained the same effect. The above-mentioned new weapons, such as killing rays, strangeness rays, and killing sound waves, require a very large power supply during manufacture, and their effective range is very narrow. Therefore, they have not been actually used as weapons until now. Perhaps they will be used in general battles after further research.</p>
<p>The above are the weapons used in battle. In addition, there are several electrical security weapons. First, let's talk about the electrical eye. This is also a kind of ray that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Its electrical nerves are distributed everywhere and are all connected. For example, in coastal fortresses, artillery pieces are set up everywhere, and electrical eyes are set up to connect with each other. As long as an enemy ship is found in one place, all the artillery pieces can be concentrated to fire, so that the enemy ship can be sunk in an instant.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the electrical ear. The highest and lowest sound waves cannot be heard by human ears (sound waves with a frequency of less than 20 and more than 20,000 vibrations per second cannot be heard by human ears), but the electrical ear can hear them. The party equipped with the electrical ear can detect all the enemy's arrangements, even if the enemy has a silencing device. It can detect the enemy's location or notify friendly forces to report that the attack has begun. In addition, high-frequency sound waves have strong directivity (that is, the property of advancing in a certain direction) and reflectivity, so they can also be used to detect enemy ships that cannot be seen with the naked eye during night sea battles, and they can also measure the distance and bombard them fiercely.</p>
<p>In the future, electricity will dominate the world of weapons. Compared with future electrical weapons, the current poisonous gas, tanks, and airships are far behind. The progress of scientific weapons may lead to the discovery of weapons that can annihilate all of humanity. The discovery of such weapons will probably be the time when war is abolished.</p>
<h3>Zeppelin's Achievements</h3>
<p>The German airship "Zeppelin" has made a total of 290 flights since its birth, passing through 536,600 kilometers and spending a total of 5,369 hours in flight, up to its return to Friedrichshafen on November 3 this year. Therefore, in terms of its speed, it is about 100 kilometers per hour (one kilometer is equivalent to one and two-thirds Chinese miles). It has carried a total of 7,495 passengers. If only this year is considered, then from the beginning of January 1 this year to November 3, it has made a total of 58 flights, with a flight time of 1,766 hours, a distance of 187,788 miles, a total of 1,218 passengers carried, and 2,745 kilograms of mail carried (one kilogram is more than two pounds), or one million letters. The total amount of goods transported is about 2,000 kilograms. Since its birth, it has traveled back and forth to South America a total of 13 times, five of which reached Livorno.</p>
<p>Long Creative Novel</p>
<h3>The Long Creative Era and the Crossroads of Love, Part 22</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang held up three fingers. "So, after deducting the travel expenses, there's not much left."</p>
<p>"Still isn't it?"</p>
<p>Lin Haiquan knew that this fellow villager was an extremely romantic young man. After entering C University, he studied and pursued love simultaneously. Because he suffered from an indiscriminate eating disorder and only sought cheapness regardless of quality, one of his friends, surnamed Duan, pushed a girlfriend he couldn't handle onto him. According to fellow villagers, that woman was already pregnant with Duan's child.</p>
<p>The woman's name was Li Huiying. Sure enough, after living in the same building as Cao Shiguang for more than seven months, she gave birth to a baby girl. Now, Cao Shiguang was studying and managing household affairs simultaneously. From Haiquan's perspective, his recent life was indeed bleak and pitiable.</p>
<p>"Old Lin, shall I introduce you to the church?" "What are the benefits?" Haiquan asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Believing in religion is not about benefits." "Forget it." Haiquan looked at Shiguang's feigned seriousness and laughed.</p>
<p>"There are many genuine articles, and they are all from decent families." "Have you made any progress?" "I regret it now. What can I do?" Cao Shiguang shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>Seeing the bus approaching, "Let's go," Shiguang pulled at Haiquan's sleeve. "Where to?" "I'll introduce you to Pastor Habar. There's a prayer meeting at five o'clock today. After the prayer meeting, that old foreigner will definitely treat us to dinner."</p>
<p>Haiquan was originally a modern university student, going through the motions, with nothing to do after class. He didn't have a specific purpose for coming out today. With Cao Shiguang's pull, he got on the bus. The ticket seller came to them.</p>
<p>"Where to?" "Where to?" Haiquan was busy counting copper coins, and as he counted, he turned to ask Cao Shiguang. "H Road Intersection... I have copper coins, let me pay." As Shiguang spoke, he reached into his semi-old Western-style suit pocket and rummaged around. After a moment, he still hadn't managed to find any coins. Haiquan had already counted out the fare for both of them.</p>

<h3>Seeking Work for the People</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>According to a 국민신문 [probably an error in the original] report from Berlin on the 15th, German Chancellor Schleicher said in a radio address that the policy of the government, in a word, is to seek work for the people. The people's urgent need is in this. As for amending the constitution and other good things that cannot stop hunger, they are not what the government wants. Only the revival of commerce can end the panic of unemployment. But to comfort the people with empty words, saying that after lean years, there will be good years, is really useless. Therefore, the cabinet is now drafting a great plan to seek work for the people.</p>
<p>This is indeed the urgent task of rulers in all countries, because in the modern capitalist way of life, on the one hand, there is a surplus of people, and the number of unemployed worldwide has exceeded 30 million. China has no statistics, but 100 million is probably not far off. On the other hand, goods are discarded on the ground, machines are idle, wheat is dumped into the water, and fields are restricted from planting. These kinds of contradictory phenomena cannot be improved until the entire economic system is thoroughly reformed.</p>
<p>Since the Great War, Germany has suffered from the burden of reparations, the loss of markets, the increase in the number of unemployed, and financial bankruptcy. The country was almost no longer a country. But the Germans still have the characteristics of Germans, with copper and iron bodies and steel-like will. Finally, the Rhineland was evacuated, invited into the League of Nations, and the reparations plan was revised. The national power is flourishing, making France uneasy in bed. Recently, it has continued to train young people extremely, advocating the restoration of conscription and demanding equal military power, making the countries of Western Europe uneasy. A depleted ball has actually inflated. This is not a miracle, but the result of ten years of struggle by the entire German people. Seeing other people's efforts really makes our uncompetitive nation feel ashamed.</p>
<p>In theory, two or three people have the same two hands and two feet, a brain, and bear the same responsibility to society. Who can not drink and eat, then who can not work? But in the current society, "eating family property" is still a noun, and "eating ability" has not yet become widespread. The authorities have no time to ask if you have food and clothing, if you have work. The government is always crying poverty, but the land has not been fully utilized, things have not been fully used, and people have not been fully utilized. In the current society, some people are idle and have nothing to do, and some people have work but it is equivalent to nothing. Workers are working all day long, and they are still worried that they will not catch a cold and fever when they sleep at night. Once the children increase, the farmers sow and weed, and work hard all year round, they are still worried about whether there will be new year's food this year. Life is so insecure, how can society have vitality? Therefore, those who do not have work should be given work, and those who already have work must be guaranteed the stability of their lives.</p>
<h3>Wine</h3>
<p>— Leng Mei</p>
<p>The alcohol content of wine varies. Among the famous wines of various countries, the alcohol content of Portuguese Port wine is the highest, ranging from 14 to 24%. Spanish Sherry is second, about 16 to 18%. Italian Marsala contains 16%. French Burgundy contains 10.5%. German Rhine wine contains the least, 10.2%.</p>
<p>The method of making wine is to place fresh grape juice in a fermentation barrel for fermentation. Because there is always a grape sugar enzyme in the air that can freely parasitize in fresh grape juice, it reproduces very quickly, thus naturally fermenting. The temperature during fermentation should be maintained at 10 to 12 degrees. The fermentation barrel used is not covered, because a small amount of air is needed. (Excessive air contact can easily cause acetic acid bacteria in the grape juice, causing the wine to turn sour, which should be noted.) After 15 days, divide it into bottles, without tightly covering them. Wait for fermentation for several months, until the sugar content is completely converted into alcohol, clarified, and poured into wooden barrels. Tightly cover and store in a cold cellar until the wine matures, with a special aroma. This aroma is caused by the combination of the fragrant substances contained in the grape juice and the various alcohols and organic acids contained in the wine to form organic esters. When wine becomes moldy, it can make the color fade and have a bad smell, so it must be disinfected. Use a disinfection method to boil the wine bottle in 60 degrees hot water to kill the various microorganisms attached to it, but the temperature used should not be too high to prevent damage to the wine taste. Adding alcohol to the wine can also make the wine more stable and have stronger antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>High-quality wine does not add chemicals. For ordinary wine, if it is weak, you can add stronger wine. If it is sour, you can add invert sugar to supplement it. If you think it is light, you can add glycerin to thicken it. These can make up for the various shortcomings of the wine made.</p>
<p>The brandy that is currently popular on the market can also be distilled from already brewed wine. This kind of distilled clear liquid contains about 45% to 55% alcohol. It must be stored in wooden barrels made of oak, and it will gradually turn light yellow over time, with a special wine taste.</p>
<p>There is a wine called Champagne, which is also made from grapes. This wine is richest in France, containing 8.4 to 9.8% alcohol.</p>
<p>The method of making it is to first place the best quality grape juice in a barrel. After the dregs have completely settled to the bottom, (about 24 to 36 hours), inject the clarified liquid into a fermentation barrel. After fermentation for 15 days, change it to a tightly covered bottle, add a little brandy. Add a small amount of fish glue in winter, and add it again in February. In May, add 2% sucrose syrup and an appropriate amount of distiller's yeast, and then bottle and tighten it. Ferment it for 24 hours, place it on a bottle bed, and let it sit for about one to two years. At the summer solstice, the yeast residue gradually settles down. In winter, cool the bottle, invert it, and shake it, so that the yeast residue is attached to the cork. Quickly open the cork, and the yeast residue will naturally shoot out. Then quickly add the sugared brandy, replace the new cork, and tie it tightly with iron wire, so that the sugar content is completely fermented into carbon dioxide and alcohol. This type of wine is called dry sparkling wine. If the sugar content in the wine is not completely fermented and has stopped, the wine obtained is called sweet sparkling wine, which is not as palatable as dry sparkling wine.</p>
<h3>Lamenting the Broken Walls and Ruins of Wusong</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>This year, my close friends Xiaoxiao and Hangfu are studying in a school in Wusong. Our old friendship makes us often think of each other, so I invited a few friends to go to Wusong.</p>
<p>Our group of three, on a drizzly morning, jumped on the first steam train at Baoshan Road Station. The train dragged on unusually slowly, which gave us an opportunity to appreciate the scenery along the way. Along the way, there are scenes that are not easy to see, not forests, not lakes and mountains, not towering buildings, and not small thatched huts. On both sides of the tracks are piles of rubble, the remaining outlines of tall buildings. We quietly appreciate, appreciate the scenery after this great destruction. It is also shameful to say that we were not excited, nor were we indignant. We just silently watched on one side and listened on the other.</p>
<p>Listening to a person wearing a tattered Zhongshan suit giving instructions in a loud voice, he seemed to sympathize with our unfamiliarity, so he kept instructing us: "This is Fudan University, this is Chi-Zhi University, this is Labor University..." And constantly sighed with emotion, we all felt a little sad, and I especially felt the sadness of disillusionment: Our dignified universities have only these fragmented broken facades left! Alas!</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Wusong, we hired three "chartered" rickshaws and asked them to pull us to that ×× University where our friends were. The rickshaw pullers seemed particularly eager to please when they heard this, and ran like they were flying. They probably thought we were students here, and students are naturally regarded as the privileged class! The three of them ran desperately for a while and dragged the three of us to that place.</p>
<p>×× University was one that survived the fierce artillery fire and was spared from destruction. It is said that many parts were also bombed, but they have now been repaired. Looking closely, there are indeed still traces of scars all over the body. Xiaoxiao and Hangfu very diligently accompanied us to stroll around their school for a few laps. In the outer room of the gymnasium, I saw three commemorative bronze tablets. One of the people commemorated was our "national" person, and the other two were Germans, Paulun and Peruns. So, I thought: The fact that our "national" university was able to escape complete destruction, isn't it still thanks to the grace of these old gentlemen? Isn't the significance of this commemoration just in their achievements in running "this school"?</p>
<p>Our team has increased from three to five. The five of us, drinking mouthfuls of the northwest wind, walked along the beach. The earth mounds on the beach, piles of them, were sometimes high and sometimes low, some large and some small, some oval and some rectangular. It is said that these are trenches. There are also some caused by bursting shells. There are no houses on the beach anymore. In the ruins, you can still find the signs of a few hotels. We kept walking until we reached the front of the fort, and saw the "only" two machine gun-like gun muzzles, proudly watching south. We wanted to go closer to see, but we were stopped by a wooden sign that said "By order, no visitors allowed, Fort Manager Bai." Moreover, there were also barbed wire fences in front, and soldiers standing upright with bayonets on their rifles! I don't know why, but I wasn't afraid of this person with a bayonet, but felt very sorry for him. I thought that the sea and land winds blowing from all directions must be enough for him to drink? We stood under the fort, everyone thinking about this place two hundred and several ten days ago, and everyone seemed to have a feeling of lamenting the ancient battlefield.</p>
<p>We walked to the market street. The market street has a completely new atmosphere! Not a single one of the dozens of shops in the city is not painted bright yellow and green. The narrow streets are filled with the fragrance of tung oil and lime. This market street is the same as my hometown, so I feel like I have returned to my hometown. Moreover, this summer, a big fire broke out on the most bustling street in my hometown, extending a long street. It has now been rebuilt, and the entire street is also filled with tung oil and lime. There is construction only after destruction, so we have a custom in our hometown that after a fire, we must first thank the Fire God, probably because he promoted us to build! So, when I saw the brand-new atmosphere of Wusong Town after its reconstruction, I felt happy and deeply thought that we should first face east and thank him, thank him for giving us destruction!</p>
<h3>The Female Gigolo in the Train Carriage</h3>
<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>For official business, I hurriedly boarded the train. Originally, I remembered that whenever I returned to my hometown for private matters, because I was short of copper coins, I had to spend that uncomfortable travel life in the fourth-class carriage, which was full of local smells and bad tastes. But now, I have completely lost my composure. Around me are couples of lovers, and gusts of fragrant aromas are constantly floating in the wind. There are also those few well-fed, snow-white, chubby gentlemen with lucky faces. That's right, with a "pass" for a first-class ticket, I can have this kind of enjoyment. The wheels were moving. At this time, a beautiful young woman, as beautiful as a flower and as radiant as jade, had filled my seat opposite me: Amidst a burst of laughter, the train left Shanghai far behind.</p>
<p>"Hello! Lend me a match." She said to me with a seductive, crisp smile.</p>
<p>"Okay." Naturally, I should hand her the whole box. In that instant, my soul began to shake. I thought embarrassedly; Could it be that fools have foolish luck? Could it be that I have encountered a stroke of good luck in love? Really, I took this opportunity to chat with her very warmly and happily.</p>
<p>"Where is your home?"</p>
<p>"Suzhou; Judging by your accent, madam, your home is probably in Nanjing, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my home is at No. ×, Zhongzheng Street. Please come and talk whenever you have the chance. Where are you going now?" "I have some miscellaneous matters, and I am also going to Nanjing." "Oh! How coincidental, let's go together. You can stop by my house for a rest when you get off the train."</p>
<p>"No, no, I'm sorry, because I have to go to the ×× Department right away."</p>
<p>"Don't you have any time to rest?" "This time, I am really in a hurry to discuss business matters, so I will have to visit you another time."</p>
<p>"What kind of business are you discussing?" "It's about the funds in the company." "Hahaha, yes, yes, then let's not be polite!" Her laughter was even more mixed, simply laughing so much that people couldn't bear it! We talked, leaning against the train window, admiring the beauty of nature. Another hometown—Suzhou—had arrived, ah, the poetic ancient city.</p>
<p>As usual, the train stopped at the station, and many travelers were squeezing on and off.</p>
<p>"I've also been to Beisi Pagoda, hey, that time I walked to the top of the pagoda, looked far and looked down, it almost scared me to death, haha." She pointed to the pagoda and said: "Ah, ah! My hat fell off at the station, I..."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I'll pick it up, you watch out here."</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>"Where is she? Oh, and my wallet?"</p>
<p>When I picked up the hat and found that she was not in her seat, I couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>"Sir, be careful, there are many female gigolos on the train!" That weird tea boy laughed at me coldly.</p>
<p>Alas! The ruthless train was still moving forward!</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Woman and Modern Woman</h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I took a long-distance bus to Shanghai in Minhang. When I bought the ticket and walked into the carriage, I saw that it was already crowded and there were no seats left. I knew that I had come too late and lost the right to sit. I had to stand hanging on the leather strap. But at that time, there were still fifteen minutes before the departure time, so there were still passengers who came after me. I only saw two Jiangbei women wearing blue cloth shirts, large silver coins hanging from their ears, and small, petite feet, also looking flustered, hurriedly running onto the carriage. Seeing this crowded scene, both of their faces immediately showed a state of uneasiness, and they looked at each other and said: "Oh dear! It's going to kill people! There are no seats left!" While saying this, they squeezed in straight through the crowd, hoping to find a seat, but it was already impossible. They had to learn my method, hanging on the leather strap like they were committing suicide.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the two Jiangbei women was a modern young man in a Western suit. I saw that his face showed displeasure, and he glared at them from time to time, as if blaming them for not coming in, making him annoyed, and even more for not knowing their place and standing in front of his new self, lest they touch his beautiful Western suit and infect him with the dirty, sour, and poor air of the Jiangbei women. I thought this modern young man was bound to lose his temper, but I knew it was not so. I only saw that not only did he not hate them, but he was also enthusiastically and kindly planning a way out for them, and said to them: "It's not good for you to sit here. Another one will open later. It's better to sit in the back," The two Jiangbei women listened and replied: "Sir, we asked. The one in the back will open at two o'clock! We still have to wait an hour," After saying this, they didn't seem to think the modern young man's words were right, and they still stood still. He heard this and hurriedly said: "Don't misunderstand, this one (pointing to the one he was sitting in) will also open at two o'clock. It will open at the same time as the one in the back!" When he said this, the two of them became happy, thinking that if they opened at two o'clock the same way, they would be happy to sit in the empty car in the back, how comfortable it would be, so they smiled and hurried to get off the bus. When the women got off the bus, I only heard him say to himself: "Annoying! She's getting a free ride."</p>
<p>The ticket had already been punched, and the bus was about to leave in three minutes. I knew that there was still a beautiful modern woman coming up. As soon as she got on the bus, her fragrance of clothes and flesh shone in all directions, attracting everyone in the car to pay attention to her. Seeing the appearance of "full of passengers", she turned her head and said to herself: "So many people! It's not easy to sit. I'll go to the one in the back," After saying this, she turned around and wanted to get off the bus. I only saw the modern young man who had just told the Jiangbei women to sit in the one in the back, suddenly saying to her: A Miss! The one in the back still has to wait an hour to open! It's not easy for you to sit. Come, come, come, I'll let you sit here," After saying this, he stood up generously and respectfully offered the seat to the woman, but he himself stood in the place where the Jiangbei women had just stood, that is, in front of the woman. After a while, the bus had already started, and he and she were already talking loudly about "Miss! Mister!" But I don't know if he still remembered that the two Jiangbei women were waiting blankly in the empty car for an hour.</p>
<h3>A Meaningful New Year's Card</h3>
<p>— Xuefan</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year, people generally happily look forward to the arrival of the New Year, thinking that the yang is turning to prosperity, and the coming year will have better luck; even people who have a clearer mind and do not believe in fate also recognize that the plan of a year lies in the spring, and the beginning of this spring is indeed worth commemorating. Therefore, over the years, everyone has had the act of congratulating each other on the New Year, and it has been difficult to change the accumulated habits, and they have gradually become a custom.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, New Year's greetings have mostly been replaced by New Year's cards instead of personal door-to-door greetings. However, in this country where the rivers and mountains are broken and the barbarian cavalry are rampant, it would be too ignorant of current affairs to congratulate the New Year in the same way. At least this year's New Year's greetings should contain some impression of the national crisis, and bring some stimulation to the brains that are about to be forgotten. A New Year's card like this is still somewhat meaningful. I have a friend who recently printed a New Year's card, and its wording really wins my heart, so I am eager to transcribe it to share with like-minded people and for observation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Try to see today's Northeast, whose world is it still? The map has changed color, and the barbarian cavalry are rampant! 400 million people are living drunk and dying dreamily. Where is our ray of light? Young people! Arise, aim our guns forever at our enemies, and jointly save this nation that is about to sink, and jointly awaken this dying national soul. At this time when the yang begins and the earth returns to spring, I hope that you can use new strength to intensify your work, and use new plans to develop your future. Old friend! Time flies, shouldn't you whip it harder? Congratulations on your boundless future!"</p>
<h3>Respect "King" Embrace "Queen"&lt;</h3>
<p>— Shigong</p>
<p>In these days, even the president is a little tired of playing. The most fashionable, one by one finger counting past, it's the chairman, the member. Whatever "emperor", whatever "king", has already reached the setting sun, it's time to enter the historical museum. Puyi, the chief executive of our Northeast "Manchukuo", knows current affairs. When he gets to the Yellow River, his heart is still not dead. He should be ashamed. The chief executive doesn't want to... Still wants to... Still wants to be lonely and寡德 [phrase meaning virtuous but isolated]. Going against the tide and turning towards me, it can be said that he is abandoning the world.</p>
<p>"Emperor" and "king" are not very fashionable now. The attached "queen" will naturally fall without a fight. But now in the Shanghai market, the atmosphere of restoration is extremely strong. The general big bosses with their chests puffed out and their bellies protruding rack their brains to manufacture something, preventing people from imitating and counterfeiting. So they add a tail to the things they make, calling it "King". In this way, no matter how people imitate and counterfeit, it seems that none can be called a King. For example, a person selling chamber pots calls the chamber pot he sells "Chamber Pot King". A person selling rice buckets calls the rice bucket he sells "Rice Bucket King". Although the motive of this kind of title is only to express that this chamber pot rice bucket is different from other chamber pot rice buckets, it is still suspected that the atmosphere of restoration is too strong and it is somewhat out of step with the trend.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Yue Lu</h3>
<p>— Banruo</p>
<p>(1) Winter Lodging</p>
<p>Although she is another corner of society, the appearances within it are no less complicated than a bustling intersection. I remember A-Rong was sentenced to two months in prison for theft. On the day he was released, when he saw the light of day again, everyone knew the joy of regaining freedom. However, A-Rong made an abnormal request. As he pleaded with the warden, tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Warden! Please let me stay a few more days. The weather is so freezing, and I can't find work. I don't know what else to do. Kind Warden..."</p>
<p>"Haha! You're treating the prison like a hotel." The warden replied with a comical laugh. He said that to stay in a real hotel, you have to pay for the room. Moreover, in a prison with housing and food, what was he afraid of when facing a lawsuit?</p>
<p>(2) Inscriptions in Prison</p>
<p>If you visit a so-called model prison, you will find inscriptions from master calligraphers, such as commemorative words like "XXX stayed for eight years and four months," or "Heaven will entrust a great task to this person; it must first imprison him." There are even lamentations like "Those who haven't been to prison aren't heroes," and "Those who come here again will become cowards." Thus, one can see that kidnappers, robbers, veteran gunmen, petty crooks, and political prisoners all write and draw like famous people on these walls. It is truly a feast for the eyes. Perhaps the flavor of iron bars is also interesting. There are "Kings" and "Queens." In the highest institutions on whitewashed walls, among the female students of a school, whoever has the best grades, the prettiest face, the slimmest figure, the most fashionable attire, and the most flexible social skills, all on a level playing field, and whose overall average score is the highest, the rest of the students will willingly become slaves under her high heels, and respect her as the "Queen." Originally, if there is a "King," there must be a "Queen." However, since "Great Lord" does not fit the trend, "Queen" is also not in line with the times.</p>
<p>"King" and "Queen" are fashionable now. The old brother among daily newspapers, this newspaper with sixty years of history, can also proudly call itself the "King of Daily Newspapers." This supplement is an appendage of the "King" and can also call itself the "Queen of this Port." However, true gold fears no fire. We certainly don't need to boast like this, using a title that doesn't fit the current trend and has a flavor of restoration. I also think it is superfluous for Puyi to dream of restoring his throne. It is necessary to completely eliminate all the "Kings" and "Queens" of Shanghai. We must not always go backward.</p>

<h3>Writing to a Friend's Wife (Continued from Part 13)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Ah, little brother! The moment she uttered these two sentences, I was so embarrassed that all the muscles in my body tensed up. I wished I could open a window and jump out to escape immediately.</p>
<p>However, beautiful Piglet! Don't panic! I have already decided to risk my life and leave specifically to protect your reputation. At this time, how could I allow her to see through my pretense?</p>
<p>"Haha! Haha!" I used all my strength to grab my heart, preventing it from wavering in the slightest. Then, imitating her madness, I leaned back and forth, laughing heartily.</p>
<p>"Laughter can't cover this up!" She is truly a frightening woman. "That day, Lin Bao-cheng and I saw you and Zhou Dajing's wife at Zhaofeng Park. Weren't you two whispering sweet nothings there?"</p>
<p>She wanted to question me, but she revealed the truth herself first. What relationship did she and Lin Bao-cheng have? What were they doing together at Zhaofeng Park? However, I was also suffering from a guilty conscience, so I couldn't joke with her anymore. I was busy giving you a strong explanation.</p>
<p>"That's not true! You two must have been seeing things!" I tried my best to remain calm, like a pastor.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Would we not be able to see your ghostly face clearly? As for Dajing's wife, there's still some doubt. But according to Lin Bao-cheng," she actually showed mercy and took three steps back voluntarily. "That person is indeed her. However, you don't need to worry. I will never stir up trouble for others. Besides..."</p>
<p>Her face was completely filled with a kind of contemptuous mockery, which I found unbearable.</p>
<p>"These words are very important. You can't make wild accusations!" I didn't let her continue to be presumptuous and immediately interrupted her. "I can swear to you right now: if I really had such a thing, I will definitely be beheaded or shot within a year! And my descendants will be wiped out, and my flesh and blood will be separated!"</p>
<p>I swore about almost all the facts that were about to come true.</p>
<p>Dear little brother! Swearing is originally a last resort for foolish people. However, in extremely difficult situations, even non-foolish people sometimes have to use it, especially in front of women. Swearing often has a great effect.</p>
<p>"Oh! Why bother! You're still childish!" She really believed that I was wronged because my oath was too earnest and too vicious. "Why swear such a bloody and venomous curse? Actually, I didn't believe there was such a thing. I was just teasing you!"</p>
<p>As soon as she softened, I felt as if I had taken a thousand-pound stone off my back and felt much lighter. It's a pity I didn't know sooner. Now, that little hooligan, Lin Bao-cheng, may still be hiding this secret in his heart. My dearest darling! This is my lifelong regret. Please forgive me especially!</p>

<h3>Hopes for Anna May Wong</h3>
<p>— Ailian</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the only Chinese people with a foothold in Hollywood are Anna May Wong and Yang Aili. She is still studying and cannot be called a star. What can be consoling is that in the artistic world, there is also Wong Chung-Hoh, who has been promoted to the basic photographer of Fox Corporation. Most of Jane Gaynor's major films were shot by Mr. Wong. It is very pitiful that a large country with 500 million people only occupies such a small position in the world's film center.</p>
<p>What's even stranger is that Hollywood's only Chinese female star, Anna May Wong, has been invited to England by Universal Corporation.</p>
<p>England has recently paid great attention to the film industry and plans to completely shift the world's attention to film from Hollywood to the British Isles. This summer, the British government issued an order prohibiting all film stars from leaving the country. At the same time, it used the most generous salaries to attract established American stars and sent special commissioners to reside in Hollywood for a long time. As soon as there was an expired contract or other opportunities, they would immediately seize the opportunity to move the stars to the east coast of the Atlantic. In half a year, they had collected quite a few. Now, our Miss Wong has actually been selected, and we will probably see her in British films soon.</p>
<p>This time, it can be regarded as "honorable behavior" because the position England has given her is much higher than in the United States, allowing her to play at least a supporting role.</p>
<p>Ordinary Chinese people always feel that she is a gold-worshiper with no sense of patriotism, because no matter how many times the Chinese film industry has invited her back to serve her country, she has ignored them. Given the current decline of the Chinese film industry, it certainly cannot offer her the same rich salary as the United States.</p>
<p>She has enjoyed material pleasures but ignored spiritual work. She also acts in films that are unfavorable to China with a fearless spirit, such as "The Red Lantern" more than ten years ago, "The Sea Wolf" seven or eight years ago, and the recent "Shanghai Express." Which of those films did not increase China's shame?</p>
<p>"Let bygones be bygones." There is no need to talk about everything. This time she goes to England, she is the first Chinese actress in Europe. I hope she will no longer be a slave to money and sell her personality. She should show the Europeans the talent and perseverance of the Chinese people, create a new situation, give people a good impression, and win some respect for the country. China will never forget this artistic star, Miss Wong.</p>

<h3>The Need for Rural Cinemas</h3>
<p>— Daosheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows the effect of movies. They are not only works of appreciation, not only entertainment, and not only toys for people to relieve boredom. They have the power to transform society, and they are the best tools to improve society. Indeed, a good film, a meaningful film, has a greater and faster effect than government decrees.</p>
<p>Recently, the government has also realized the importance of film education, considering it a very effective tool for social education, and will make efforts to promote it. Therefore, I feel the need for rural cinemas.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the current cinemas are located in cities. As for the countryside, which has a large number of farmers, there are very few of them. This is of course because the founders of the cinemas only care about monetary gains and do not consider other aspects of income. However, the need for cinemas in the countryside is no less than in the cities. I think that if there were cinemas in the countryside, screening real and meaningful films, the workers and peasants would definitely come happily after work. It is not difficult to achieve the purpose of education through entertainment, enlighten the people, improve habits, and dispel all the shadows in the countryside.</p>
<p>It is best for the government to assist the local administrative authorities in establishing them extensively in the rural areas of each place, providing very low-priced seats for workers and peasants to watch, or even completely free.</p>
<h3>The Honor of the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Meicun</p>
<p>The Mayfair Club is the most famous club in California. Many famous socialites and starlets are members. However, in past elections, no actors have been elected as president, and no actresses have been elected as vice president. However, the president elected this year is Frederic March, and the vice president is Norma Shearer. This is an honor for the Hollywood film industry.</p>

<h3>Biography of Mary Pickford</h3>
<p>— Wentao</p>
<p>Mary Pickford's films are among the most popular comedies in Hollywood. Especially her style is most easily welcomed by children, because her pure and innocent childlike spirit fully caters to the children's desires. Therefore, more than three million children in the United States enthusiastically support her works. When her films are shown in theaters, the theater owners must sacrifice two-fourths of the seats to these many half-price children! Since she changed her style, the children who welcomed her have become indifferent to her, and at the same time, a large number of children have left.</p>
<p>She is British and grew up in Canada. Her family was very poor. Her father was a tea boy in a theater in New York, so their lives could only be barely sustained. When she was nine years old, because of the lack of financial resources, she joined the theater where her father worked to supplement the family's income as an extra little actress. She earned a dollar a day. Later, her innocent expression, lively posture, and clear singing voice were indeed able to win the praise of the local people. Her reputation became higher and higher day by day. At the age of fifteen, she signed a two-year contract with the theater. Her weekly salary jumped to six hundred yuan. Two years later, when the contract expired, she was hired by United Artists as an actress. From this time on, she began her life on the screen. At the age of eighteen, she married Lowell Sherman, a famous film actor at the time. But soon after, they had disagreements and divorced. After that, she began to work hard under the limelight, and as a result, she became one of the most brilliant movie stars on the screen. At this time, she met Douglas Fairbanks. Their love gradually deepened, and they finally became husband and wife. They were once honored as the queen and king of film, and they were also the most perfect marriage in Hollywood.</p>

<h3>Screen Faces (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Dunruo (Translator)</p>
<p>"When shall I come again?" she asked, very puzzled. "We'll let you know when we need you again. There's no certainty," said the one giving her the wages with much amusement. She, quite unaware, went slowly home to wait to be hired again.</p>
<p>In the following months, she was summoned with increasing frequency. In "The Abyss of Voices," her dreary and coldly unsympathetic attitude, walking before a group of women, left a most profound impression upon all who saw the picture; almost every review commented upon this scene, and when this scene was screened, the audience almost stopped their breathing.</p>
<p>Pictures dealing with social problems were very much in vogue that year, and she had become accustomed to performing in crowd scenes; her presence in these scenes always gave them an extra touch of reality.</p>
<p>Trilby Cabasquie was no longer lonely; sometimes when she had not been working for too long she would go to the film company's engagement department. Her hopes gradually grew larger; she hoped to make her career expand so that she could earn more money.</p>
<p>The first money she earned from films she used to pay off the doctor's fees, and for her husband's funeral expenses. She sent her only son, a simpleton who loved playing with matches, to a local home that cared for children with intellectual developmental disabilities. Even though she herself did not earn a great deal, she could, at any rate, breathe a little more freely.</p>
<p>She had lost her job as an extra. Quite luckily, she found a man who rented her spare room. Anton Basch was a widower who made his living selling ice, and he paid twelve marks a month for the room, and half of the gas bill; moreover, he was very affectionate towards her. Wishing to gain Basch's favor, she bought a white cloak. She also made meals for Basch. She made him the sandwiches of sliced meats to take with him when he went out, which made it appear as if she herself ate better food. Gradually the deep hollows and the shadows on her face disappeared. This was now the height of her career. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Editor's esteemed regards: After reading your newspaper's fifteenth issue, I found that the description of Gao William in the "Supplement to Their Leading Men" was not entirely accurate. Mr. Gao himself claims that he has never been to Hollywood and has never played a supporting role with Barrymore. Four years ago, he returned to China from Cuba, where he was engaged in business, and immediately joined the Great Wall Company as a comedian and painter. He has now been hired by the United Company and went to Hong Kong long ago, and is not serving at Lianhua. I am sending this letter to correct the record and hope it will be published for all to see!</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Saturday Revelry? Not Quite?</h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>Hollywood had many new rising stars in 1929. But at the time, some people admitted that the only one who could replace Clara Bow was Nancy Carroll. Her works such as "Honey," "Sweet Kitchen Maid," and "Youth Club" all give us the impression of sweetness and warmth. It has been a long time since we have seen her! Of course, with the big advertisement for "Hot Saturday" revealed at the Grand Theater, everyone will say that this movie is good before seeing it. I'm not here to spoil the fun, but while it's good, it's not as good as it used to be, not as good as we imagined.</p>
<p>The film is still centered on love. She plays a female bank clerk who falls in love with a romantic talent. However, because of the jealousy of another young man, many rumors are fabricated, and she is caught red-handed - not returning home one Saturday night. As a result, she is forced to resign from the bank, and her family does not accept her. At this time, she meets another young scholar. Unexpectedly, she is suspected again because of gossiping. By the time the scholar realizes his mistake, the girl has gone to New York with her old lover, the romantic talent, to get married.</p>
<p>Nancy remains a lovable little deer, being chased by people in the game of love (note: the original name of this film is "Deer Chasing in the Game of Love"). Before the film is finished, there is indeed a feeling of "not knowing who will die at whose hands." She deals with men in a non-committal way, carrying enough of a shy mood of a young girl, but it is also a pity that she has not been able to show her original extremely sweet and warm talent. Although Cary Grant, who plays the romantic talent, is named the protagonist, he performs very little, and his performance can only be said to be good. Randolph Scott, who plays the young scholar, is very good, but there are too many humorous places. Edward Woods is the most beautiful and suits the role the most. However, I think none of these three people are enough to complement our sweet girl.</p>
<p>The whole drama is named "Hot Saturday," and there should be more revelry on Saturday. There is not enough revelry in this film, and the full force is concentrated on "romantic." Therefore, the photography, set design, and lighting are all excellent, presenting the beauty of "full moon and beautiful flowers" and "silence of all sounds" everywhere.</p>
<p>The director is still worth watching. The division of scenes adds a lot of highlights. The sketches of the fragments and the narration of the whole film have their memorable parts. The side shots (dark scenes) are very clever.</p>
<p>The meaning of the film is very superficial, still only talking about the relationship between money and love, and the contradiction between the individual and society. Indeed, it may have the effect of promoting girls to indulge in "revelry." However, if I were to write an advertisement, I would definitely not say it as seriously as Guanglu has published.</p>
<p>Nancy has undoubtedly not made any progress compared to the past. I still say the old saying:</p>
<p>"The movie is very good, very beautiful, and worth watching, but don't expect too much from it beforehand." What do you think, Mr. Bai Gu?</p>
