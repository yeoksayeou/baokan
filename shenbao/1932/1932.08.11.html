<h3 id="c1">論銀借欵（下）　仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>年來世界各國物價。急轉直下。然我國之物價。則節節上昇。而我國租稅。地。租工銀等等。大都無甚變動。故一面雖銀價下落。貨幣價格略有减低但實際。</p>
<p>仍無極大之利害可言。綜之在世界經濟不振中銀價下跌。其於我國之影響。尚不爲烈。設此後世界經濟。能得改善。則我國因完全處於原料國家之地位。在金貴銀賤風浪之中。受害實非淺鮮。是以其根本癥結所在。則不在於銀價。</p>
<p>之崩落。而轉在乎國家工業之不振也。</p>
<p>明乎。此則年前林百克氏斡旋銀借欵之成不成。自無所謂患得患失即銀借欵之議可以成能否挽回若干銀價之厄運。吾人固未敢臆料。而借銀成立後之用途如何。分配方法如何。歸還時期如何。償欵方法如何。利率如何。要皆爲事先必須澈底解决之問題。</p>
<p>今林百克氏。不日將有返國之行。據四日南京專電。謂（銀借欵事聞係美銀界與各公司工廠等擬在華發展合辦或獨辦投資事業。委託林氏代徵我政府同意。並非純粹貸欵性質）云云。是則年前銀借欵之計劃。行將復燃不過改一部分之貸欵爲投資。變其貸欵人之政府爲銀團或工廠。而林氏仍不失爲其居中介紹人也。</p>
<p>我國工業窳敗。若將來世界經濟能得改善。銀價依然萎縮不振。則我國必遭遇一極大之危機。是可斷言。今若美國願作對華投資之嘗試則吾人自當竭誠歡迎之不暇。唯外資之利用。利則可以興邦。害則可以亡國。吾人於借受之初。不能不深深考慮及之。往年因善後借欵而設立稽核。所侵害我國家行</p>
<p>政主權。因築路借欵而各路任用洋員。致使大權旁落。凡此種種。皆足爲今後之殷鑑。在吾人之意見。以爲借用外資時之最低條件。應（一）不能侵害中國國家行政主權。（二）不得任用洋員爲重要企業管理人員（三）原料品之可以求之於中國者。應在中國購求之。（四）企業技術人員。不妨任用洋員。但須中國人副之。（五）不得創設與中國人已辦之類同事業。以相競爭不然春蠶作繭處處自縛耳。</p>
<p>昨年九月。日軍侵我領土。國人敵愾同仇。相率抵貨。然一年以來。成績已漸趨下降。其原因似不全在乎我國人之無持久性。而在國貨方面。無相當之代替品可覓。英美製品。貨値又昂貴。在此種情形之下。而欲求抵貨之能發生澈</p>
<p>底效力。其勢甚難。故今後美國。如能善意的對華投資。吾人固亦極望其能早日實現也。</p>

<p>宋孫等對汪電發言甚多</p>
<p>張及方蔣胡先後訪張羣</p>
<p>平各政委均勸張勿堅辭</p>
<p>北平通訊、行政院汪院長辭職各電發表後、平市各方面頗爲震動、茲調查關於此事全般經過及張學良之確切表示、錄誌於次、</p>
<p>空氣緊張　汪精衛之魚電、於六日下午十時許到平、適張學良在劉哲私宅、與宋哲元高桂滋孫殿英等閒談、秘書長吳家象携帶原電、親到劉宅、面呈張氏、張閲電後、戟刺極深、當露消極之意、並將該電交宋等傳觀、宋等咸以治安爲重、極力勸慰、且議論紛紜、有認爲係政潮之發動、借題發揮、於華北局面無關係者、有指摘汪院長不應如此隨便動作者、同時更有擬議由各軍表示意見者、宋孫二人發言尤多、惟張學良認爲事關重大、部將不應輕於發言云、十二時許、張親至北京飯店訪蔣介石代表張羣、密談兩小時、張羣當電京漢、探詢眞相、並轉達張意、二時許、張始回順承王府、召集榮臻鮑文樾朱光沐劉哲徐永昌商震于學忠宋哲元龐炳勳孫殿英吳家象等幹部要人與張羣等、徹夜會議、决定一面致電汪精衛、有所剖解、一面電蔣介石請示、並派鮑文樾即日赴漢謁蔣、面陳一切一致蔣電報、當即擬就拍發、電文頗長、辭意懇摰、致汪一電、係申叙個人懷抱、並對禦侮籌餉諸端、詳爲解釋、措辭頗覺委婉、電文擬就、尚未拍發、擬再熟商以後、始行發出、會商至七日晨五時許、始行散會、七日晨張致電中央、部署所屬、準備交代、鮑文樾原定七日乘飛機赴漢、嗣因尚有與張商協之處、未克啓程、七日上午十時、方本仁蔣伯誠胡若愚等、至北京飯店、與張羣會商此事、共電京漢、探詢一切、並陳北方情形、請示方針、</p>
<p>政委開會　北平政務委員會、七日下午五時半、在順承王府舉行談話會、出席者計爲張學良·徐永昌·商震·傅作義·龐炳勛·宋哲元·孫殿英·張羣·方本仁·蔣伯誠·蔣夢麟·于學忠·張作相·王樹常·王樹翰·周作民·熊希齡·魯蕩平·劉　·湯玉　·（談國桓代）·韓復榘·（宋式顔代）·因爲談話會、故未推主席、首由張報告、汪來電及答覆汪電内容、表示辭職、討論許久、各委均勸張勿堅持辭職、惟張態度極堅决、並承認個人過去之錯誤、結果决定、（一）由張電汪辭職、其致汪電大意謂、九一八事變發生後、東北淪陷、本人應負責任、理應辭職以謝國人、此後政務交北平政務委員會、軍事交北平軍事整理委員會分别辦理、惟當此國難期間、汪院長擔負全國行政重任、不宜以個人細故、突然求去、請即打銷辭意、繼續負責、（二）用北平政務委員會名義電汪、說明請中央補助財政經過、完全爲熱河財政困難、僅請求撥一二百萬、並未請求每月補助五百萬、亦非假抗日名義而事聚歛、（三）由談國桓電湯玉麟、說明此事眞相、對熱河</p>
<p>財政困難、仍當設法補助、（四）由北平綏靖公署參謀長通令所屬各軍隊、安心訓練、勿爲傳言所動、</p>
<p>財政問題　據平政委會消息、汪電指摘張學良之財政要求有三、（一）向財政部索五百萬、至少先交二百萬一節、據聞係政務委員會决議、且公推李石曾赴京接洽、同時並派胡若愚前往、胡氏迄尚未行、李則與汪宋一見之後、已放洋赴歐、預定昨今當到香港、其非有何正式接洽可知、（二）責鐵道部籌二百萬一節、經過聞頗複雜、先是北方因有某項要需、無從籌欵、中央亦正艱窘、乃議由北寗路某項存欵中撥借二百萬、係轉賬性質、先曾由張託宋子文、向鐵道部代洽、顧孟餘氏已復電允爲帮忙、嗣以派張姓科長北來一次、議忽中變、祗允令該局籌借三四十萬元、更稱部中需欵、飭將前議之二百萬元解部、以是不無爭論、最近張曾電某部長訴及此事、頗有牢騷、說者謂事聞於汪、故有出走之舉、確否不可知、惟顧孟餘之求去、則的係與此項交涉有關、（三）籌助熱河三百萬元一節、據聞係某方表示希望、並非張所要求、且並非每月籌助、</p>
<p>張决辭職　張得汪電之翌日、有人晤見張學良氏、據稱張謂得汪電後、痛心已極、决意辭職、聞張自言九一八以後、内疚於懷、久無戀位之意、祗以平津治安關係、不容任意求去、今得汪電、爲之開闢去路、寗不心感、惟所不解者、汪以黨國領袖、果認有張某在、於政府之主張貫澈、覺有妨礙、儘可明令免職、以示威信、如認爲欲張某在職、與其政策上另有不便、則一介之使、命之辭職可也、何必用迂迴曲折之法、徒失政府之身分、視國家前途如兒戲、如何使國人對政府信仰、不令外人齒冷、且所引爲罪狀者、又多不符於事實、尤爲遺憾、張氏又謂復汪之電、業已擬就、除剖辯財政問題各點外、於上述兩點、亦經述及、有人又問張氏辭職後辦法如何、聞張表示目前政治暫交政委會、軍事暫交軍委會負責、一面電蔣委員長、希望蔣本人能來北平主持、本人願以參謀幕僚資格相爲佐理、如蔣不能來、則希望政府派一能在北方負責之大員蒞平、本人亦必盡力相助、總之、無論如何、不使以個人進退、貽地方以不安、重增本身罪戾、要當盡最善之力、使北方無絲毫動搖云云、（八月八日）</p>

<p>發揚國威僑胞愛戴</p>
<p>｜李惠堂陳鎭和分隊服務｜我國南征勁旅南華强華兩足球隊、在海外轉戰</p>
<p>各地、所至聲譽溢揚、僑胞愛戴、爰將兩隊最近戰績、約述於後、以解國内球迷之喝、</p>
<p>南華敗於意尼</p>
<p>結果二對三南華自以三對零之比、戰敗隆選隊之後、無敵之名四傳、七月十九日與萬隆本届盟主意尼隊作戰、</p>
<p>無意失守　四點三十分、動員令下、二隊猛攻、爲時不過一分、意尼右翼賀拉爾氏盤球沿邊直上、深入華南左防、舉脚猛向中傳、竟於無意中、球落龍門之左角、周門將察覺施救、球</p>
<p>竟觸柱彈入、南華遂不幸先負一球、</p>
<p>違法無效　意尼僥倖得球、福星不招</p>
<p>而自來、李惠堂身先士卒、破防直入街騎叩關、敵守門見援兵不至、急出迎敵、惟被李將軍閃過、直中龍門、其時李義臣求勝急切、違法偷入、判員認爲過界、勝球無效、上半場、竟以零比</p>
<p>一受屈、</p>
<p>夢想不及　上場再戰、攻守益烈、不</p>
<p>一分鐘、敵方左冀偷入、將球傳中、陳右衛頭不用命、被敵右内、挺胸撞入、又再負一球、南華無敵之名、發生搖動、五路齊進、力奪失地、李義臣首立奇功、報復一球、李惠堂指揮全軍、深入腹地、李氏施用平地射入、成二比二、</p>
<p>罰球敗北　和局之後、我軍聲勢更大</p>
<p>敵方左右受敵、大有由和而勝之勢、李惠堂得葉北華之助、單騎直入、防軍悉被閃過、敵門出迎、李氏以巧計制之、將球向門之右角徐送、無如球帶泥遲行、竟爲敵方救出、繼而南華告急、譚江柏解球觸手、罰十二碼球、一脚命中、結果二</p>
<p>比三失敗、</p>
<p>葉北華</p>
<p>譚江柏　梁榮照　李惠堂周賢言　黃美順　李義臣陳玉書　梁彦贊　朱國倫</p>
<p>黃紀良　　南華四對零勝壟隊</p>
<p>隔日再以八比一大破中聯隊南華大軍開抵壟中之後、翌日與壟地選手隊較</p>
<p>手、</p>
<p>南華發威　列陣開火、相戰十五分鐘、不見勝負、李惠堂引軍深入、鑒於防軍森嚴、無機偷渡、祗得將球撤退、徐傳黃美順、黃氏一脚、中往而入、先開紀錄、從此南華滿飛全場、不久李惠堂妙彈一發、正中網角、造成上半場二對零之結果、</p>
<p>十人得勝　下半場壟選背城作戰、五路</p>
<p>齊攻、終以防線鞏固、所至不利、而南華則乘隙入攻、葉北華受規出場、南華乃以十人應戰、時光飛流、僅錄五分鐘、李惠堂飛渡、打中一球、接</p>
<p>後李義臣亦攻入龍門結果四對零得勝、隔日南</p>
<p>華又以八對一大破中聯隊、</p>
<p>强華戰日選平手｜結果二對二｜隔日三對零大敗靑聯强華隊實力平均、斯時得李惠官之助、威名益振、七月二十三日與直葛日惹聯隊比賽、極一時之盛、</p>
<p>開塲失足　由日惹省長、入塲行開幕禮、强華假勢直入、李惠官李鴻淸先後射擊、咸未命中、捲土重來、鄭少康花彈連放、悉爲敵阻、敵門屢受壓迫、因無準確槍手、機會盡去、上半</p>
<p>塲零對一失敗、</p>
<p>終成和局　下半塲陳鎭和調前作中鋒</p>
<p>、前鋒線因是大活躍、强華依然如上半塲高占權威、蹴門工夫欠佳、每多功虧一簣、一次陳中鋒傳球李惠官、李氏蹴去之球、竟觸李鴻淸之脚彈入、成一對一、强華奪回之後、勝算似在掌握、球才復開、又將日選包圍、未幾又攻入一球、轉和爲勝、忽而内部空虚、遂被敵方乘隙打中、再成二對二和、隔日强華以三對零大破靑聯隊、湯坤　李鴻淸</p>
<p>丘東炎　孫錦順</p>
<p>黃潤星　徐亞輝　何家强</p>
<p>麥紹漢　李惠官</p>

<p>（七十一）</p>
<p>七十八　　古廟畢究是個怪物，漸漸引起了城裏人的注意。有些人起初是來看風景，忽然發見這個怪物，就好像哥侖布發見了新大陸一般，便一傳十，十傳百的告訴别的人，以致來賓絡繹不絕，弄得我整天的燒水忙，泡茶忙，送客忙，忙得滿頭大汗。流汗我是不怕，所怕的是汗兒白白的流了。他們那個走馬看花的模樣，是把我們這古廟當作大世界玩。我倒想順便和他們談談各種活動的意義，使他們帶些種子到别處去撒。那知道總是使我失望。他們老是問我。（你們這裏有多少學生？學生有幾位？一年經費多少？）我的舌頭跟着我是不大舒服，整天要回答這些千篇一律，乾燥無味的話語。</p>
<p>今天是破天荒，來了一位經濟學博士唐先生，聽說我們辦了一個鄕村工學團，特爲跑來參觀。他是仔仔細細的問，我是興高彩烈的答，眞是痛快極了。我那舌頭今天算是幸福；抵償了許多天的徒勞而有餘。最後，唐博士給了我一個驚人的問題：（現在是一個機器的世界。機器做出來的東西是價廉物美，决不是手工藝所能和牠競爭。你們要自已種棉花，自已紡棉紗，自已織棉布，自已做棉衣服穿。這離然是一個美麗的理想，但是靠你們古廟自已的力量來幹，只能辦到木頭機的手工藝，怎好與機器的産品競爭？人家是價廉物美，你的是價貴物粗，如何賣得出去？手工藝遇着機器是被壓得粉碎，怎麽能提倡？古廟應該領導農人迎頭學外國；迎頭學外國是學外國最新的機器，如何開倒車？）我是被唐博士問獃了，簡直是被他問倒了。不要緊，這倒是我求學的一個好機會。我從來没有像今天這樣受窘過。我以爲受窘越厲害進步越實在。朱先生與唐先生的見解是針鋒相對了。他們倆必有一個錯。趕快去請朱先生來，讓他們開一個辯論會。不管那個對，我總能長些見識。（唐博士請坐一會兒，我去找朱老師來和你談。）</p>

<p>中央尚無表示　中央對行政</p>
<p>院各部會長之總辭職、昨日尚未有若何表示、據吳市長談、日内當有慰留電來滬、懇請行政院各部會長復職、共任艱鉅云</p>
<p>蔣再電汪挽留　軍委會蔣委</p>
<p>員長、自接汪院長曁各部會長辭職電後、本擬即日來滬、面請返京復職、祗以剿匪軍務在身、不能分身離漢、故特電致汪氏、懇即赴漢、面談一切、汪氏於前日接到該電後、即於昨晨、派中央政治會議秘書</p>

<p>、以避賓客、茲悉汪氏業於前晚遷出該醫院、至遷往何處、則甚秘密、外間無由探悉、據汪氏左右云、汪氏業於前晚離滬、赴淸靜之處稍作休養、記者昨以此事質</p>
<p>諸吳市長、吳氏加以否認、謂汪氏刻仍留滬、惟居處則甚秘密耳、又訊中央各要人曁吳市長鐵城、本擬昨日下午與汪氏會晤、再進詞挽留、但汪氏態度仍堅、行踪秘密、仍未獲謀面、據汪宅宣稱、謂汪已於昨晚離滬他往休養、汪氏前昨二日、均拒見賓客、外間亦頗有懷疑汪氏已離滬他適者、據吳市長談、林主席雖有電約汪氏赴廬山會談、但汪先生表示、在中央未准彼辭職以前、不願首途、故可斷定汪氏日内、當仍留滬、决不他適、</p>
<p>各中委之意見　留滬中委居正·何應欽·吳鐵城·等、以汪氏態度堅决、各部會長又提出總辭職、恐稽遲時間太久、有碍中樞政治進行、前昨兩日、會商結果、决分頭進行解决辦法、即一方面想出一解决東北問題之適當辦法、一方面極力挽留汪院長、務使其復職而後已、蓋中央除此、别無他策、先准張辭職說不確　　汪氏左右言　昨據汪氏左右語遠東社記者、謂汪先生認爲各部會長官之辭職、係責任内閣政治上之通例、與其個人無關、汪先生旣憤張氏之不抵抗而辭職、自有不得已之苦衷、决不能因各部會長官之總辭職、而即打銷辭意也、至於政局之能否有進展、則端視乎華北問題之能否獲得適當處置耳云云、</p>

<h3 id="c228">剛柔 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>院長進的　茸人物，有一句聊以解嘲的話，呌做；柔能克剛。　　這是，受了老子的毒；老子見舌，以爲柔的好，見齒，以</p>
<p>爲剛的不好。他說；齒堅剛，先弊；舌柔，是以存。</p>
<p>後人引伸其義，以爲，做了舌，常受齒的侮辱；偶一不愼，被齒嚼痛了，舌不敢抵抗。但是，年深月久，這三十六員牙將便不免先後陣亡，惟有這個不抵抗的舌，郤是到老無恙，這便呌做柔能克剛。</p>
<p>唉！不見得吧。只聽得牙齒嚼去了舌尖，不聽得舌尖挑去了牙齒。只聽快刀切豆腐，兩面光鮮；不聽得買一塊豆腐，眞個可以在上面撞死。剛能克柔，是常事；柔能克剛，只是弱者在那裏自吃安心丸。</p>
<p>淞滬的瘡痍未復，華北的風雲又急了！我們的軍事當局，做舌頭呢？還是做牙齒呢？</p>
<p>歷史告訴我，漢唐對外主剛，漢唐雖已過去，漢人唐人的名稱，至今存在；宋朝對外主柔，後世稱爲宋鼻涕。要是，一味的主張不抵抗，宋鼻涕以後，又有民鼻涕了！</p>
<p>即使，柔能克剛，是有效的；到這柔難再柔地步，也只有寗爲玉碎，毋爲瓦全。</p>
<p>偶讀洪北江先生剛柔篇，他也說：｜即云柔可勝剛，吾寗爲龍泉太阿而折，不願爲游藤引蔓而存。</p>

<p>— 毛仿梅</p>
<p>昨日參觀中華學藝社之美術展覽會。在申報攝影社出品展覽室中。見日人所製絲織手帕一幀。係李蔭覃先生所藏。詳繪奉天吉林黑龍江熱河外蒙古諸省地圖。與日本隔海而立。以奉天吉林兩省爲最詳。而旅順威海衛之險要。營口山海關之修阻。閲之一目了然。</p>
<p>手帕下方。附印滿蒙一覽。署昭和五</p>
<p>年。載明面積（東四省）六萬五千六百方里。人口三千三百七十萬。旣耕地一千三百萬町步。農産物約十三億圓。日本人二十二萬。（附屬地共）</p>
<p>吾人觀此。可知日人之欲攫取滿蒙。其處心積慮。無孔不入。即一手帕之微。亦必聯繪滿蒙與日本之地圖於其上。可謂極侵略之能事矣。嘗聞日本之小學生。對於滿蒙之面積人口形勢氣候物産交通等等。皆能瞭如指掌。而吾中華之國民。反覺茫然。予對此手帕。三復揣摩。實汗顔</p>
<p>無地焉。</p>

<p>— 石子</p>
<p>婦女服裝。隨俗趨時。道學先生。即譏爲攸關風化。守舊落伍。摩登少年。即目爲前世紀之女子。夫以茲方二十歲左右之女子。尚未徵得對手方者而論。則服裝一道。實爲最難解决之問題。蓋二十左右女子之父母。當然必爲四十或五十以上矣。四五十之間者。已逾越其靑春之生活。所發生之思想。當然較諸二十左右之靑年人爲頑固。於是對於膝下女兒之服裝。往往欲以二三十年前自身之所服御者爲準範。視女子之袒膝露裎。爲不顧廉恥。視女子之解放胸乳。爲敗俗傷風。殊不知丁茲時會。兩性結合。一爲學問性情之相合。而服裝問題。亦居重要地位。蓋服裝可增加美的成分不少也。</p>
<p>舍戚某翁。有女已逾花信。愛逾掌珠。有求無不應。而獨於服裝一事。則拘束綦嚴。不許稍趨時尚。論婚者。數已逾百。十載蹉跎。迄無一就。探其原因。因服裝大古。而不就者。佔十之三。戚友勸其遷就潮流。放棄成見。以求早得東牀者衆矣翁竟作色而對曰。以貌取人者。已爲下乘。以服御爲準則者。直纨袴耳。我寗願我女以丫角老。不願納紈袴於甥館也。今春。女抑鬰患瘵卒。翁雖哭之慟。而卒命以古嚴爲殮。近世有爲服裝面犧牲三　　　大率皆困於經濟。不能隨俗趨時。而狃於硜硜之見。若某翁之女。則並非無資置辦。特老父不許。致婚媾屢敗於服御太古之一端。竟至抑鬱以殉。余聞之。悲感不置。爰白其事於衆。深望爲父母者。有女及䈂。萬勿以今日之奇裝異服。爲不顧廉恥。爲傷風敗俗。要知靑年女子。服御不趨時尚。婚姻將受阻碍。靑春將被躭誤。某翁之女。可爲殷鑒。</p>

<p>鎭海軍艦。直轄於渤海艦隊。近方壯遊南溟。實爲華艦之第一次駛赴台灣。此行無外部執照。可謂異數。忽於前日駛抵淞濱。又係首次蒞滬。艦長盛建勣（報載誤刊爲伊兄建勛）篆頡英。年方强仕。籍𨽻南匯。與予誼屬桑梓。髫年英姿奮發。折節讀書。懷祖生之擊楫。慕宗慤之長風。初負笈於煙台海軍校。繼畢業於金陵海軍軍官學校。埋首陰符。窮年兀兀。以景行之文采。履平子之風霜。劍膽簫心。爲儕輩所推重。長鎭海艦蓋亦有年矣。邇爲該艦海軍學生。實習航駛。於六月下浣。由靑島啟椗。　歷蘇浙閩粤各海口。雖經雨橫風鏖。瀧濤駿浪。但履險若夷。已告返斾。萬里鵬摶。布帆無恙。喜可知也。予於昨晨赴高昌廟海軍碼頭。坐該艦自備汽船。登艦卽與盛艦長握手相晤。暢叙鄕誼。並蒙欵以邭筵。深情若水。盛君稱國内海軍校。現祇有威海衛。馬尾黃埔三處。馬尾海校較完備。奉直戰前。靑島祇有三軍船。現共十艘之數。與列强之艨瞳較量。眞如衣敝縕袍。與狐貉者立。自恧落伍。汗顔無地。凡國家之海岸線愈長。對於海軍之設備亦愈不易。覘人國者。咸以其軍艦之多寡爲凖。肝衡祖國之軍艦。不過慰情勝無。時局旣看朱成碧。潮流復轉綠爲黃。目前當務之急。宜重實業以富民。如能肆力於鋼鐵業之製造。及增加各種生産。以期民生富裕。則海陸軍之振興自易。國基可固。反之但圖增厚某方面之武力。適足殃民。其弊有不忍言者。此次駛抵台灣基隆港。華僑喜出望外。熱烈歡迎。宛如十字軍之望見耶路撒冷。繼則參觀博物院總督府司令部各報館等。並與中國領事袁家達。及中川總督鈴木海軍武官等相晤。旋由中川總督。派栟山秘書課長。赴中國領事館答訪。又赴中華總會館歡迎宴。沿埠視察。感慨偏多。按台民早於甲午之前。受迫改𨽻日籍。於甲午後赴台之華僑。約六萬人。日政府限制綦嚴。對於智識階級則尤疾視。赴台者大半爲煤礦工人。理髮匠。侍役等勞工。華僑每埠均設會館。總會館則設於台北。自去年始。方設領事。該地禁止華人設校。及報館。寄往中華書籍。概爲海關没收。僑民困於法網。時遭蹂躪。亡國之慘。何其酷也。以是僑民無不熱望祖國之隆盛。及平臨行送别。咸覺愴然。間赴大鵬灣瀏覺。深覺大有用處。淪爲盜藪。殊堪扼腕矣·娓娓淸談。不覺移晷。繼又參觀無線電報室。輪機室。地圖室等。該艦航海正方君。謂軍用地圖。以英倫印製者爲最優。卽蓬島所印地圖。大半多向英製迻譯者。我華則乏善可陳。艦之中央。設有閲書室。如萬有文庫各大雜誌等均備。黃卷縹緗。琳琅滿架。各部均感布置整潔。釐然不紊。軍士鸛鵝。。</p>
<p>有序。彬然知禮。旋與盛艦長同乘汽船抵岸話别。言日内卽擬離滬。將遠避大陸之驕陽。浮海逭。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>汪精衛以張學良坐擁大兵，數日之間，喪失三省土地，並不抵抗，嗣後錦州掄陷，亦坐視不救，現在熱河告急，京津震動，中央命張出師，抵抗暴日，收回失地，而張反多方要挾，並不出兵，於是汪大摜其紗帽，誓不與張合作。　　張學良見汪精衛已摜紗帽，無顔戀</p>
<p>棧，雖其心中未心眞肯辭職，而面子上不能不一摜紗帽，亦請辭職，不過又說，行政院長可以一摜即走，我統帥諸軍，不能一摜即走，須有交代，故張學良雖非眞心辭職，亦總算摜了一摜紗帽。　　各部會長，以此次汪氏下野，態度堅决，已無挽留餘地，因此中央各部會長，以責任内閣之主持人物，旣已堅辭，爲表示同進退計，亦一齊大摜紗帽，此種紗帽，雖爲挽汪作用，但亦不能不</p>
<p>算摜紗帽。</p>
<p>蔣介石聞汪摜紗帽，急電何應欽朱培德等，謂汪院長辭職，無論如何，須堅决挽留，如汪定不幹，弟亦辭職不幹，是蔣亦願摜紗帽，惟蔣之摜紗帽，無非表示堅决挽汪之意，但亦不能謂非作摜紗帽之表示。</p>
<p>現當國際形勢，非常嚴重之時，一齊大摜其紗帽，誠爲不幸，誠爲大不幸，不過此次摜紗帽之總因，多爲張學良而起，倘張眞肯辭職，則許多紗帽，可以收回成命，但張一面表示辭職，一面仍表示其手下大軍，須得人來統率，其眞摜紗帽耶，抑假摜紗帽耶，只得且看下回分解。</p>

<p>皮革的效用甚大，像做皮鞋皮包布帶及錢袋等，都用牠來做原料，此項皮革當質地柔軟，色澤美麗，堅靭耐用，不畏水漬日曬，才算合格，革的原料是生皮，各種畜類的血皮是牠的原料，再以重鉻酸鉀，明礬，單寗酸等，使她發生特異的效用，就是不腐敗，不硬化，且耐用，能防水和不畏日晒等工用，</p>
<p>（一）製革的各種方法　生皮所用的藥料，可分三大類：（一）用動物的油類，敷在生皮背面，加熱，使逐漸養化，而成一種油皮，（一）用植物的單寗酸（即拷皮）浸漬生皮，而成紅色的皮革，（三）用礦物質製皮，此法又分二類：（Ａ）用明礬，及食鹽漬皮，製白色的皮，（Ｂ）用重鉻酸鉀或鉻明礬漬浸生皮，製成淡綠色的色是稱鉻皮（俗語稱她是駱駝皮的訛稱）</p>
<p>（二）製革新法的完全手續（Ａ）準備···除去皮上的汚物質，使皮漲大，而易於吸收藥水，（Ｂ）鞣的製造···以藥水浸皮，使成堅靱的革，（Ｃ）修飾···將她來整理修飾，使她美觀，引人購買的工作，</p>
<p>（三）製革的準備　準備方法可分：（一）浸水，（二）漬灰，（三）脫毛，（四）刨肉，（五）脫灰，和（六）浸酸等六種，　　（一）浸水是使：（Ａ）不潔的物質除去：（Ｂ）溶去鹽質；使皮容易賬臌，</p>
<p>（二）漬灰是使：（Ａ）毛根周圍的細胞破壞，使毛脫落；（Ｂ）皮面賬臌，易於吸入藥水；（Ｃ）皮中的脂肪除去，其方法將皮浸漬在石灰水溶液中，加以攪拌，并加些硫化鈉，（三）脫毛｜用鈍刀刮去其毛，（四）刨肉｜刨去表面皮上的肉類，（五）脫灰｜將石灰水洗凈，法將鳥糞浸水，取面上淸澄的溶液，浸皮其中，時常攪拌，約有一星期之久取出，（六）浸酸一是使：（Ａ）皮收縮：（Ｂ）中和水和石灰質，</p>
<p>（四）鞣製和修飾　用鉻質鞣製法有二種：（Ａ）用（甲）（一）重鉻酸鉀五磅（二）鹽酸二五磅（三）水四百磅（乙）（一）次亞硫酸十磅（二）鹽酸五磅（三）水四十加倫（以生皮一百磅爲標準）把兩種（甲）的溶液先將皮浸入，呈黃時取出，吹一畫夜再投入（乙）種液中，（Ｂ）用（一）鉻明礬</p>
<p>十五磅，（二）炭酸鉛四五磅，（三）食鹽四五磅，（四）水一百五十磅，（以生皮百磅爲標準）將浸脹的皮，投入絕不攪拌，約二十四小時之久愈久愈佳，以藥水深入皮中爲合宜，任用（甲）（乙）兩種液浸皮後，再加以染色，使她美麗，有光澤方好，而製革的手續就成功了，</p>

<h3 id="c257">改良厨房之我見 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>誠如持佛君所說的，一家厨房之淸潔與否和一家人之健康繫有莫大關係。所以厨房的確有改良的必要，現在將敝意寫在下面淺陋之見還祈諸會員加以指正。</p>
<p>一、厨房須大　在上海一般資本家｜房東老爺｜只要能夠多造房屋，多收房金，所以房子的開闊也變狹了，竈間在房東心目中似乎更不必要，所以弄得和豆腐乾般大，可是在上海單幢的石庫門裏往往住着三四家居户，煑飯時候一起哄在厨房裏，人一多要淸潔恐怕不容易呢？在熱天小小的一家厨房裏擠着三四人，熱氣，人氣，逼着恐怕還容易中疫，還有因爲房屋的狹小所以柴一類的引火物也都堆在厨房裏，試問小小一間竈屋，什麽能一定不發生危險呢？所以我以爲厨房必須改大。</p>
<p>二、厨房設備須簡單　上海厨房旣然這樣小，像上面所說的又須大房東肯發慈悲心改良纔有效，否則祇憑我們房客在紙上說說還是没有用，所以在小厨房壓迫之下我們只有用設備簡單的方法來補救，在平時厨房裏受着油膩的蒸薫，已經很爲不潔凈，要是再堆着不必要的東西更覺混亂，不乾凈，所以我以爲厨房裏除必要之灶頭外，祇需檯子一隻，預備揀選菜，或切肉等事，除此之外至多再放一具碗櫉，至於稻柴之類最好勿放在厨房裏，還有經濟稍寛裕的，最好每年粉刷一次，因爲厨房裏最易藏汚，如蜘蛛之類常在厨房裏佈網，上面一些只是暫時想到的，也是改良厨房最淺微的二點。</p>
<h3 id="c258">復改良吃飯 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>昨見本刊發表，怡怡館主君改良吃飯建議，我拜讀之餘，稍有疑點，茲將管見所及，陳述如下，務祈高明者，加以指正焉。</p>
<p>怡怡館主君所爲（共食主義）因爲幾個人共吃一碗菜，或是一碗湯，經過多次大家的箸，和匙的掏洗，這碗菜，或是湯，就得在無形中加上許多唾沫，如果這幾個人之中，有一個是患肺癆病的，或是其它的傳染的那末他的病菌，難免不從他的箸上，或湯匙上，傳播到菜肴裏，其他幾個康健的人，吃了這染有病菌的菜肴，就要發生危險了。</p>
<p>以上是怡怡館主的意思，我以爲一家之中，旣然有了患肺癆病的人，及其他有傳染病的人，事實上其餘的人，都應該格外的處處預防，改良吃飯，倒可不必，因爲（病菌）無形的傳播，｜空氣中，桌椅上，器具等，｜不僅在（共食主義，）改良到（分食主義，）可以避免一切，况且這種共食主義，自古以來，相傳至今，假定其危險性之大，固如此，那麽一直傳到現在，目今的中國，恐怕早難存在了。</p>
<p>至於（年來我國人，事事歐化···，）試問歐化在那裏？一切的一切，依然任人侵略，受人鼻息，所化的無非是社交公開啊！男女跳舞啊！一切的浪漫啊！而怡怡館主君所言的歐化，不知是什麽？同時更不知是什麽？同時更不知如此的歐化，怡怡館主君亦表同情耶？（却酬）</p>
<p>家庭問題</p>
<h3 id="c259">一個溺愛子女的家庭 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>隔壁姓馬的老夫妻倆，是一雙抱着溺愛子女主義者，所以造成了子女不良習慣，我現在把牠細細地寫在下面。他老夫妻倆有二個兒子和二個女兒，設了一爿ＸＸ店，生涯倒也十分興盛。</p>
<p>他的小兒子已經年將弱冠，也讀了好多年的書，化上了幾千塊錢。但是：祇曉得穿西裝，看電影，向父母伸手要錢，整天消耗在懶惰和閒游的當中，他的父母是抱着溺愛主義者，所以任憑他浪揮。或者：有些親戚勸他找一件事做，薦他一二個公司裏的職位，可是：懶惰和閒游慣的他，當然；不能盡心供職，而且三四十元的薪俸，也不夠他幾天的揮霍，所以不上幾天，他也不願做了，回到家裏，坐享安逸，這樣的事已經發生了好多次。</p>
<p>他在去歲的春天，已經結了婚，可是：他没有一些生産力，當然；一切的費用都仰他父母供給。西裝每天要換上幾套，却苦了家裏的娘姨，把衣裳　個不了。</p>
<p>大的女兒，也届及䈂之年，一天到晚專門喜吃糖果等小食，尤其喜歡與男子們厮混在一起，所以名譽也有些不佳，然而；她的父母也不去禁止和管束。像上面的家庭，我們可以斷定他是腐化的，頽敗的，也是社會的微生蟲啊。</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3 id="c260">分贓化的學校 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 顯章</p>
<p>爲了初中畢業，我就失學。｜因爲當時我所讀的學校祇有初中的。｜爲了恐防誤進上海的無數野鷄中學，我想出一個很可憐而極笨的方法，就是擇那些有名的，有悠久歷史的學校。謹愼精密地檢閲報章以後，我就發現Ｘ中學在招考新生。Ｘ中學我已是久聞大名如雷貫耳了。</p>
<p>此外，我有一個親戚也在那裏讀書，所以我就毅然去投考了。本來我以爲鼎鼎大名的Ｘ中學的招考一定是很嚴厲的，考題一定是很複雜艱難的，可是出乎我意料之外；Ｘ中學的招考無所謂考，也没有考題；一個招考的敎師僅僅問了在從前在那裏讀書，同時又約略地問了一些以前的學校裏所讀的書名，收了一塊錢的報名費，看了看文憑；所謂入學考試是完畢了。他很直爽地說：（Ｘ月ＸＸ日你來繳費上課好了。）我抱着滿腹的狐疑和驚奇。走出Ｘ中學。以後我就到一個在Ｘ中學讀書的親戚家去一探究竟，據他的答辭如下：</p>
<p>Ｘ中學本來是一個很平常的學校，平時的約束並不十分嚴，學生的成績也很平凡。一二八戰役之後，Ｘ中學受了戰事的間接影響而愈形惡化了。不知怎的，别的被災的學校，在戰後都恢復了原態，學生們成羣的從悶窒，狹小的敎室裏擁進擁出。而Ｘ中學，大約因爲學生們都是住在戰區裏的緣故，祇是學生們驟减下去不見其增。這使學校當局不勝憂慮的。學生少了學費的收入當然也减少，學費一少，敎員的薪俸當然也不得不减，較好的敎員當然不願再在這裏蟄伏着，都捲起舖蓋自動走了；蹩脚的敎員，本來以Ｘ中學爲唯一的吃飯問題解决處的，當然不能走的，於是繁重緊要的功課就不得不使他們兼任。聰敏多智的校長先生不願把慘淡經營的成績和歷年社會上虚榮失去，就想出一個極妙的折衷辦法；不使敎師憤憤不平而出怨言，當然也不能使學校當局蝕本，就是拿學生的學費，除去了一部分必須的學校行政費外，餘下的就分贓般校長Ｘ股敎員Ｘ股校役Ｘ股分攤，這公平的辦法，使敎員皆大歡喜，於是就有濫招新生的惡習發生，你也受他們的欺騙了。）　　聽了這些話之後，我默然，同時我也大悟了。中國的領土是你那一塊，我這一塊地分贓，學校裏當然也要發生這裏現象，這是事之當然，又何足怪哉</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Silver Loan (Part 2) Ren <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, commodity prices in various countries around the world have plummeted. However, commodity prices in our country have been rising steadily. Meanwhile, our taxes, land rents, wages, etc., have mostly remained unchanged. Therefore, although the price of silver has fallen and the price of currency has slightly decreased, in reality,</p>
<p>there is still no extremely significant gain or loss to speak of. In summary, with the global economy in recession, the fall in silver prices has not had a severe impact on our country. If the global economy can improve in the future, our country, being entirely in the position of a raw materials supplier, will suffer significantly in the storm of expensive gold and cheap silver. Therefore, the fundamental problem lies not in the collapse of silver prices,</p>
<p>but rather in the stagnation of our national industry.</p>
<p>Understanding this, the success or failure of Mr. Lin Bai-ke's mediation of the silver loan is not something to be unduly concerned about. As for whether the silver loan agreement can reverse some of the unfortunate fate of silver prices, we dare not speculate. However, how the loan will be used after its establishment, how it will be distributed, when it will be repaid, how it will be repaid, and what the interest rate will be, are all issues that must be thoroughly resolved beforehand.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Bai-ke will soon be returning to his country. According to a special dispatch from Nanjing on the 4th, it is said that "the silver loan matter is that American banking circles and various companies and factories intend to develop joint ventures or sole proprietorships in China. They have entrusted Mr. Lin to seek the consent of our government. It is not a purely loan nature." If that's the case, the silver loan plan from previous years will be revived, but part of the loan will be changed to investment, and the government as the lender will be changed to a banking group or factory, while Mr. Lin will still be the intermediary.</p>
<p>Our country's industry is dilapidated. If the global economy can improve in the future, but the price of silver remains weak, our country will inevitably encounter a major crisis. This can be stated definitively. If the United States is willing to try investing in China, we should of course welcome it sincerely. However, the utilization of foreign capital can either benefit the country or lead to its ruin. We must consider this deeply from the beginning of the loan. In the past, the establishment of audits due to the rehabilitation loan infringed upon our national administrative sovereignty, and the appointment of foreign personnel on various roads due to road construction loans resulted in the loss of major powers. All of these should serve as a profound lesson for the future. In our opinion, the minimum conditions for borrowing foreign capital should be: (1) It must not infringe upon China's national administrative sovereignty. (2) Foreign personnel should not be appointed as key management personnel of important enterprises. (3) Raw materials that can be sourced from China should be purchased in China. (4) Foreigners may be employed as enterprise technical personnel, but Chinese personnel must be appointed as their deputies. (5) No businesses similar to those already established by Chinese people should be created to compete with them. Otherwise, it will be like a silkworm spinning its own cocoon, binding itself everywhere.</p>
<p>Last September, the Japanese army invaded our territory, and the people of the country were united in their hatred of the enemy and boycotted Japanese goods. However, over the past year, the results have gradually declined. The reason seems not entirely due to the lack of perseverance of our people, but rather to the lack of suitable replacements for domestic goods. British and American products are also expensive. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to achieve a thorough boycott. Therefore, if the United States can invest in China in good faith in the future, we sincerely hope that it can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central Government Intends to Approve the Resignations of Wang and Zhang <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei is Favored by Various Parties for the Position of President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Position of Director of the Beiping Pacification Office Will Be Inherited by Either He Yingqin or Zhu Peide (Nanjing) The problem of the resignations of Wang and Zhang, which has attracted attention from all parties, is that the central government officials mostly respect Wang's opinions, that is, on the one hand, approve the resignations of Wang and Zhang, on the other hand, select appropriate personnel to succeed Wang as the President of the Executive Yuan and the Director of the Beiping Pacification Office. Regarding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, Wang proposed that Mr. Cai Yuanpei take the position, and Chiang also agreed. Summarizing the opinions of all parties, most are also interested in Mr. Cai. However, Cai's interest in politics has long been weakened. According to his expression, he is old and weak and his energy is insufficient, so it is difficult to take the position. He still asks Wang to maintain this difficult situation. As for the position of Director of the Beiping Pacification Office, the successors are none other than He Yingqin and Zhu Peide. Neither He nor Zhu are willing to take the position, but if the central government strongly appoints them, it will be difficult to refuse. It is also heard that a Deputy Director will be added in the future, which will be taken by Yu Xuezhong to assist. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person talked about who will command the troops stationed in North China and the directly subordinate troops in the Northeast after Zhang leaves Beiping. It is really a difficult problem, but Zhang's resignation is very firm. Chiang cabled Zhang to persuade him to be patient and not to argue, and also expressed that he would advance and retreat together. Zhang went to Xishan within days, expressing his resignation, and the military and political affairs were handled separately by the Military and Political Committee. It is difficult to realize Wang's request to send personnel to the north. One or two generals in North China advocated a joint telegram to Wang and Zhang to mediate, but there has not been any concrete contact. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources today, Zhang Xue-</p>
<p>Liang has received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek. The content has not been disclosed, but it is heard that the telegram contains a solution that Zhang Xueliang cannot completely accept. The public regards this as Chiang's private telegram, not an official document. According to the latest news, Zhang's resignation has not been accepted, probably because the majority of important people are currently in Shanghai persuading Wang to cancel his resignation. Therefore, the status of the past 24 hours has not changed. Many important people persuaded Zhang to change his plan, but it was of no use. (Reuters Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The political situation on the surface has not changed tonight. According to reliable sources, Zhang Xueliang still has the determination to resign. Now he is only waiting for Chiang's official telegram to arrive before he plans to hand over. Therefore, before Chiang officially expresses his attitude, there will be no development here. The public opinion is that if Chiang retains Zhang, Zhang may be able to change his will, but if the official telegram is not satisfactory, Zhang will definitely leave. It is heard that Han Fuju and other generals in the north intend to telegram Zhang and Wang to persuade them not to be too lofty. If Zhang decides to retire, they will cooperate to maintain the security of North China. Now, most people suspect that even if Zhang resigns, he may not be willing to give up his military power. This fact is the key to the whole problem. Unless Zhang actually gives up, the forecasts about the successors, such as He Yingqin and Li Jishen, are all conjectures and unimportant. (Reuters Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chiang Cables Wang to Urge Immediate Resumption of Duty <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Chiang now has a telegram to Wang, the contents of which are: 1. Because of the intense suppression of bandits, he cannot come to comfort him in person immediately. 2. Now that internal troubles and foreign insults are urgent, the central government cannot lack someone to preside over it. Please allow him to return to Nanjing immediately to resume his post, so as not to cause changes in the political situation. 3. The Northeast Incident is being discussed every day, and he will take full responsibility for handling it. Once the suppression of bandits comes to an end, he will transfer elite troops to the Northeast, determined to resist Japan. 4. Zhang Xueliang's departure is a secondary issue. I hope that my brother will take the country's affairs as the most important thing and resume his post immediately. From the perspective of status, my brother does not have to argue lightly about leaving</p>
<p>and taking office. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Yan Advocates Giving Zhang a Nominal Overseas Trip <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, Yan Xishan telegraphed Wang to persuade him to resume his post, and advocated that the central government grant Zhang a nominal overseas trip. It is also heard that Feng Yuxiang also expressed his approval</p>
<p>of this proposal. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Zhang Xueliang Receives Reporters Again <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang was still in the former Prince Shuncheng's Mansion at 7 p.m. on the 9th, receiving news reporters from Beiping and other places stationed in Beiping. About 50 reporters from the press arrived and were received by Shen Nengyi, Shen Zutong, Tang Guozhen, and others. Zhang apologized for the slow reception due to the late hour, and first offered a simple meal to the guests. After the meal was over at 9 p.m., Zhang personally came out to talk. First, he apologized for the slow reception. Second, he said that he had just read Mr. Wang's Qi telegram, and saw the talks of the reporters on the Geng Day at 4 o'clock, and there were many criticisms of him. Mr. Wang is my elder and also my superior. I never want to argue about anything he criticizes, fearing that the more I argue, the more there will be. But the facts are there, and I have to say a word to you to clarify the truth. The major plan of the country should be made by the government in advance, and then orders should be issued to order local officials to abide by them. This is the right way to do things. As a local official, how dare I execute major events related to survival without authorization? According to Mr. Wang's Qi telegram, on the one hand, he believes that the current military leaders of the provinces are all separatist and hates them deeply. On the other hand, he believes that the provinces of Hebei and Chahar seem to belong entirely to him personally. All military and financial affairs, as well as foreign affairs, should be borne by the provinces of Hebei and Chahar. This kind of thinking seems to forget the position and responsibility of the government. Mr. Wang said that I intercepted tax revenue and did not understand the national government. However, this method of appropriation was stipulated by the government and the Ministry of Finance in 1919 and can be documented. Mr. Wang must have been busy with official duties and did not check it in detail. Tax officials, except for those within the scope of the provincial government, are appointed by the provincial government in accordance with the law. Officials of agencies under the central government are appointed by the government or by the Ministry of Finance, all of which have government orders and ministerial orders that can be examined. The so-called "revenue was swallowed by me in one gulp" is too heavy a statement. If this is the case, I have violated criminal laws. Mr. Wang is the highest administrative leader and can find evidence and enforce the law at any time. The Supervisory Yuan can also impeach me at any time. The finances of Hebei and Chahar provinces have always been open. Recently, the financial reorganization committee has supervised and guided them. All income and expenditure have budgets and monthly reports that can be examined. However, most of the personnel of the Financial Committee are also members of the Military Committee and the Political Committee. The various military and political expenses under my jurisdiction have been reported to the government and the Ministry of Finance and can be checked by the gentlemen. Now I would like to report this point publicly to you. Currently, excluding Rehe, the total monthly revenue of Hebei and Chahar provinces from national and local taxes is 3.8 million yuan, and the annual revenue is 45.6 million yuan (see attached table), all of which is managed and supervised by the Financial Committee. The monthly expenditure on military expenses is more than 4.7 million yuan (see attached table), which is temporarily allocated by the Financial Committee at 4.5 million yuan. Salaries are paid every 35 days, and 10 months of salaries are paid per year, totaling 45 million yuan. However, the monthly allowance of 1.15 million yuan must be paid for 12 months, which should be increased by 2.3 million yuan. Adding the expenses of the Political and Financial Committees of about 360,000 yuan, the total expenditure is 47.6 million yuan. Compared with the income and expenditure, the Financial Committee uses 12 months of income to supply 10 months of expenditure, which is still not enough 2 million yuan. On the other hand, the Pacification Office is still more than 200,000 yuan short each month, and the annual loss is more than 2 million yuan. The total loss is more than 4 million yuan, all of which can be checked in the accounts, which is not the fact as Mr. Wang said. In addition, I would like to report on the central government's subsidy to North China. From April 1920 to the end of January 1921, a total of 7,397,350 yuan was allocated in cash. From October to the end of this year, 3,528,650 yuan of arrears and unpaid promissory notes were allocated (see attached table). In addition, Mr. Wang's telegram said, "The central government has no right to intervene," and "It is a family in name, but a foreign country in reality." I wonder what facts can prove this. Since I was ordered to take office, I have asked the central government for instructions on all military, political, and diplomatic affairs. I would like to ask what matters I have not followed orders to handle, and what matters the central government wants to intervene in, but I have not agreed to? There are also words of bloodshed, internal strife, and national subjugation, which are imminent. To this day, the country is indeed in great danger. If there is internal strife again, the country will not perish. I am willing to solemnly declare that I am willing to resign to thank the people of the country and to thank Mr. Wang. Internal strife will never start with me. I can sacrifice my life, but I will never do anything that will sadden my relatives and please my enemies. I also hope that the ruling authorities will show the world with sincerity and set a great plan to save the country as soon as possible. They will truly abandon their prejudices and self-interests and lead the masses with the attitude of great politicians. China will not perish. Although Xueliang is gone, his heart will be comforted.

<p>(Beiping) After Wang and Zhang resigned, Han and the generals telegraphed each other for consultation, deciding that the generals would jointly send a telegram to Wang and Zhang, asking them to take the national crisis as the most important thing and not to be passive. Before the central government has a specific plan for the military and political affairs of North China, they will continue to maintain the current</p>
<p>situation with their entire strength. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's determination to leave is very firm. The generals of the Northeast, Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Sun Dianying, Pang Bingxun, Gao Guizi, and others still uphold the purpose of unity against foreign aggression and jointly maintain the security of North China. They will not make any statement on the resignations of Zhang and Wang for the time being due to the importance of the matter.</p>
<p>(Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju said that he has no opinion on the resignations of Wang and Zhang, but he believes that those who are responsible cannot go far in the face of national crisis. Therefore, he now telegraphed Wang and Zhang in his personal capacity, requesting them to resume their posts, unite sincerely, and face the national crisis together. There will be no incidents in North China in a short time, because at this point of national crisis, no one with a little conscience can bear to kill each other. If there are any disputes on political views, it is also a common occurrence and will not have a major impact. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The generals of North China telegraphed Chiang to request him to retain Zhang. Chiang replied by telegram, with words of advancing and retreating together. Zhang ordered the guards to go to the Summer Palace for rest. Xu Yongchang tried his best to retain Zhang, asking him to go to the east instead of the west, meaning to go out of the pass to resist Japan. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwest Executive Department telegraphed the Central Executive Committee on the 10th, stating that since the September 18th Incident occurred, Zhang Xueliang adhered to the policy of non-resistance, losing hundreds of thousands of miles of land in the Northeast and trapping 30 million compatriots in fire and water, so that the arrogance of the enemy became more and more intense and extended to Qinghu. The Headquarters has repeatedly telegraphed to request his removal and punishment in order to show the national law, and the national people have also made a unanimous request. However, Zhang has always adhered to the policy of non-resistance, occupying important areas in Peiping and Tianjin, and blocking the only way for resisters. He turned a blind eye to the violent Japanese invasion of Jinzhou, and ignored the arduous struggle of the volunteer army, which cannot be tolerated by party discipline and national law. Now, when Rehe is in danger, he has not heard of him sending a soldier or firing an arrow, but only telegraphed the central government to raise millions of military expenses as a threat, so that the central government's long-term resistance proposition cannot be implemented, and the national people's desire to recover the lost land by force cannot be realized. His sitting and growing the arrogance of the enemy is indeed an unforgivable crime. If he is not dismissed and punished, not only will he not be able to save Rehe and recover the Northeast, but he will also endanger Peiping and Tianjin and affect Luoning. It is requested that the central government severely remove and punish him in order to maintain national discipline and boost the national anti-Japanese spirit. The telegram does not mention Wang's resignation, but only</p>
<p>telegraphed Wang in a personal capacity to retain him. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japan illegally relays telegrams from the Northeast. After repeated protests from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have learned that the Japanese side has recently changed its relay method due to obstacles caused by our country's blockade of postal services in the Northeast. Telegrams from Manchuria to Europe are sent directly to Japan via their existing wired facilities. The Nagoya Postal Bureau then relays them to Europe from that bureau. According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, this practice has been in effect since August, making the evidence of their illegality even more conclusive. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 10th)</p>

The reported statement by the Ministry of Communications that it had changed its policy regarding the blockade of postal services in the Northeast and resumed accepting mail to the South Manchurian Railway Zone and its affiliated lands is a misunderstanding.

<p>Expressing Sincere Support for the Pact of Non-Aggression</p>
<p>Becoming a Major Permanent Policy of the United States</p>
<p>Absolutely Not Recognizing Situations Created by Force</p>
<p>Aimed at Encouraging the League of Nations to Take Strong Action Against Japan</p>
<p>Japanese People Indignant, Plan to Take Serious Diplomatic Steps Against the US</p>
<p>The Foreign News Agency reports that US Secretary of State Stimson gave a speech at the New York Foreign Policy Association on the 8th (The Development of the Pact of Non-Aggression in the Past Three Years), saying that unless he perceives the pressure of world public opinion behind it, he cannot understand its power. The article strongly criticized Japan's military invasion of our country, which has aroused opposition within Japan, showing that it is not comparable to ordinary talks. It is as important as his letter to Borah. Various foreign news agencies have only transmitted the gist of it. The US Navy Radio here has received the full text, which was released by the US Consulate General. Now, we are translating it in its entirety for the quick viewing of our countrymen. However, because there were interruptions during the reception of the telegram, it still needs to be verified. Secretary Stimson's speech is as follows: Several years ago, the United States and France jointly initiated the so-called Briand-Kellogg Pact to eliminate war. Later, in 1929, the treaty officially came into effect. Now, 62 countries have joined. After the treaty was ratified, it was announced on July 24, 1929, and immediately suffered the first of a series of criticisms, and these criticisms have not yet stopped. The United States government is at the forefront of defending the treaty. Regarding the history of the past three years, it is appropriate to evaluate the necessity of the treaty, the direction of its development, and the position we can hope it will occupy in world affairs. Since the Great War, world affairs have changed so rapidly, and we are so close to it, that it is difficult to get a proper perspective. Therefore, I think it is a good thing to briefly outline the background from which this great treaty arose and according to which the treaty is judged. Before the Great War, some people had envisioned a world without war and tried to abolish war, but these efforts never gained a comprehensive or effective trend from various countries. As a result of this goal, since the establishment of international law, most of the law in the past century has been based on the existence of war and has evolved various principles. The existence and legitimacy of war are generally the central facts from which these legal principles arise and on which we rely. As such, the doctrine of neutrality is based on the obligation of neutral countries to maintain an impartial attitude between their own government and the belligerents. Its meaning is that each belligerent has equal rights, and neutral countries have equal obligations to them. Wars between belligerents are the legitimate forms in which these rights and obligations grow. Therefore, if a neutral country supports any aspect of a belligerent or makes a moral judgment on the right or wrong of the cause of the war, at least if these judgments are translated into action, it violates one aspect of international law. As long as the neutral party strictly adheres to this impartial attitude, international law will provide considerable protection for itself, its commerce, and its property. In the decades before the Great War, the growth of humanitarianism did not mostly engage in attempts to abolish war, but rather in developing these neutral doctrines to narrow the impact of its destruction. The main goal of humanitarians was to establish a safe zone for the protection of life and property in a world that still recognized the destruction of life and property as a regular and legitimate way to resolve international disputes and maintain international policies. The mechanical prosperity of the century before the Great War and the changes in industrial and social organization that accompanied it had an unimaginable impact on the concept of war I described. Countries have gradually become less self-sufficient and more interdependent. The population of industrial countries is increasing day by day, and their food supply must rely heavily on distant sources. As a result, the civilized world has become increasingly critical of war. On the other hand, due to these mechanical advances, modern armies are more easily transported. Therefore, the numbers have increased and there are more destructive weapons. As a result of this change, the incompatibility of war with normal life has become more acute. The destructiveness of war to civilization has become more powerful, and the abnormality of war has become more obvious. The law of neutrality has gradually lost its effectiveness in preventing countries outside the war from joining the conflict. Finally, the Great War broke out, and the entire civilized world was caught in a storm. At the end of the Great War, everyone immediately knew that this war was a war to end all wars. At the Versailles Peace Conference, the victorious countries signed the Covenant of the League of Nations, wanting to reduce the possibility of war to a minimum. However, the League of Nations did not completely prohibit war between countries. Therefore, the Pact of Non-Aggression was initiated. The content of the Pact of Non-Aggression and the declaration issued on July 24 have clearly stated its purpose. Some criticize it as not being a true treaty, with no rights and obligations conferred, only a pile of uneven statements issued by the signatory countries, each declaring its sacred purpose, and none of the other signatory countries can make it count. The Kellogg Pact has no power of military sanction and cannot coordinate military competition among signatory countries. If the pact is violated, it will be replaced by the sanction of public opinion. This kind of sanction is the most authoritative sanction in the world. The sanction of public opinion depends entirely on international cooperation in peacetime, and its effectiveness depends on the will of the people of the world to make it effective. If the people of the world want it to be effective, its power is very great and difficult to resist. Since the European War, those who criticize public opinion have not truly understood and identified the development of world public opinion. Since July 24, 1929, the US government decided to approve the sanction of public opinion, to make it effective, and to guarantee that the Treaty of Paris has the power of life. We deeply hope that it can succeed and will not disappoint us. We recognize that the effectiveness of its occurrence depends entirely on the cultivation of mutual loyalty and trust between countries and signatory countries. We have also decided that the regulations of this pact must be successful. In October 1929, President Hoover and British Prime Minister MacDonald jointly issued a declaration in Rapidan, saying that (the British and American governments accept and expect this pact to be merely a declaration of good meaning and a proper guideline for national policy). In the summer of 1929, China and Russia had a conflict in Northeast Manchuria. China and Russia are both signatory countries to the pact, so their relationship to the pact is very important. We immediately focused on public opinion and called for peace. We contacted the governments of Britain, Japan, France, Italy, and Germany, and urged the Chinese and Russian governments to strictly implement their obligations under the pact. Members of the League of Nations should bear this obligation, but are not bound by the Treaty of Paris of the League of Nations. This kind of successful step cannot have satisfactory constraints unless it is based on the principles as I have described. Regarding the prevention of war, there will be new plans between countries, that is, to register armaments in order to restrain them. In addition to this new plan, various constraints and sanctions under other international laws are difficult to apply to Manchuria. Under the former international legal provisions, when the two sides clash, the damage is resolved by international law, and the injured party cannot take any action. If the two sides take free action or express public opinion, it is difficult to resolve. Today, for the sake of direct personal interests, all countries are trying their best to prevent the occurrence of war, and under the Kellogg Pact, every citizen of the world has great interests and relations. The power of the Kellogg Pact depends entirely on the united public opinion of the world, so that all nationals have the opportunity to judge. When the US government announced this pact on January 7 last year, it became a tacit agreement of public opinion, and its main purpose was to help international law with the fruit of success, because international public opinion has never been so organized or called upon. Another new period following the development of the Pact of Non-Aggression is that signatory countries must inevitably discover the need for consultation when the treaty is threatened with violation. All use of power must be discussed and consulted. The only exception that arose from the Sino-Japanese dispute last winter proved the inevitability of calling for world public opinion to consult. When a situation arises that tests the validity of the treaty, the people of the world recognize the importance of protecting their interests and consult together to make the great peace purpose of this treaty effective. This claim held by the American people has been clearly shown to the world by the recent announcements of party platforms by the Democratic and Republican parties at the national conventions held in Chicago. I believe that the interpretation of the Pact of Non-Aggression will become a major permanent policy of our country. This kind of view is based on legal concepts and peaceful ideas, which are the beliefs that the American people firmly adhere to. This kind of view is also a policy of being prepared to cooperate with others to maintain world justice. This kind of policy has been repeatedly demonstrated by the American people. At the same time, the American people also insist on their independence of judgment and freedom of action. This kind of policy must be sympathized with by all countries. We all feel that the lessons of the European War must not be completely forgotten, and the determination to abolish war must not be relaxed. The great Pact of Non-Aggression expresses this earnest desire of the world. We can only continue to work hard, so that this Pact of Non-Aggression can give full play to its greatness and become a treasure raft of heavenly righteousness. The American people sincerely support the sanctity of this pact and will certainly not fail in their duty.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th. The Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Sun criticized Secretary of State Stimson's remarks today, saying that according to people in the State Department, one of Stimson's main purposes is to encourage members of the League of Nations who oppose Japan to demand strong action when the investigation report on the three northeastern provinces is submitted. It is also heard that the State Department has received news that this report will be unfavorable to Japan. When it is formally submitted to Geneva in the future, it is expected that there will be major changes in the League of Nations' affairs. The League of Nations will be in a dilemma, and it must either take some action or admit its incompetence. It is also said that if the United States does not cooperate with the League of Nations, and if the League of Nations declares an economic boycott against the aggressor country in the future, and the United States does not recognize it, then the peace organization will be destroyed by the non-cooperation of the United States. Therefore, Stimson made this statement to dispel doubts. This is also one of the purposes of Stimson's speech.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Stimson's Remarks Arouse Japanese Discontent <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th. US Secretary of State Stimson's speech (referring to Japan as an aggressor country in the incident in the three northeastern provinces) is deeply regretted by officialdom here. It is feared that this remark will only further arouse national sentiments and produce results contrary to what the US Secretary of State expects. This afternoon, the Foreign Ministry spokesman discussed Stimson's remarks, hoping that third parties would not make remarks or actions that would make the situation even more serious. It is said that this kind of remark, like Stimson's, only increases the difficulty of the Japanese government in controlling public sentiment. Japan has decided to set up a buffer state between China and Russia. As for the timing of Japan's recognition (of Manchukuo), it depends on the nature of the Lytton Commission's report. At the same time, Japanese newspapers expressed indignation at Stimson's remarks. The Japanese government is now awaiting a detailed report from the US ambassador before deciding whether to protest to the US. The Kokumin News Agency, Washington, 9th. It is learned that Japanese Ambassador Debuchi will discuss the Far Eastern situation in detail with US Secretary of State Stimson in Washington, so that Debuchi can report the attitude of the US government to his home government after returning home. It is said that Stimson's speech in New York yesterday will also be discussed at that time, because the Japanese Foreign Ministry is quite angry at Stimson's remarks that Japan is an aggressor, but it is expected that the Japanese government will not immediately ask Stimson to make a formal explanation, because in diplomatic circles, this kind of step is more serious than a protest.</p>

<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 10th. Dr. Nitobe, a special lobbyist of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, gave a speech in the United States yesterday, saying that Japan's military actions in the three northeastern provinces were for the purpose of preventing Soviet Russia from invading the Northeast and preventing Manchuria from becoming communist. From Japan's standpoint, it is quite justified and a self-defense action. In the past, various international treaties that were unfavorable to Japan's development were signed in the first place with the intention of maintaining peace in the Far East. Now, because life is at stake, it is also justified to abandon them. Nitobe's words can be said to represent the intention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. However, those who have falsely accused us of not abiding by treaties to the world have now suddenly changed to Japan's abandonment of treaties as justified. Their barbarity and untrustworthiness can be imagined.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 10th. People here are now paying attention to the report that the Lytton Commission will submit and the debate on the report in Geneva. People here believe that the resignation of the Nanjing government is due to the intention of consolidating the Chinese cabinet in order to cope with the overall situation during the important debate of the League of Nations. The Daily Express Washington correspondent cabled that the Lytton Commission blamed Japan for deliberately creating the war in the three northeastern provinces. The US Secretary of State's remarks defending the Pact of Non-Aggression were published at the right time, so that American public opinion would have ample time to support the Pact of Non-Aggression before the Lytton report was published. The Daily Herald, the organ of the Labor Party, said in an editorial that when the League of Nations meets in Geneva, there will be a faction whose main purpose is to exonerate Japan. The small countries fought against this faction this spring.</p>

<p>The World News Agency reports that recently, the mayor of Otaru initiated a discussion meeting for educators in the city, inviting Dr. Yamakawa Takeo and Count Futara Yoshinori to give speeches on the current situation. At that time, in his speech on the Manchurian issue, Dr. Yamakawa made some remarks that were not satisfied with the actions taken by the Army Department in Manchuria this time.</p>
<p>He said that in this Manchurian Incident, the opinions of the Army and Navy were not consistent, and the Ministry of the Army claimed that the Manchurian Incident was initiated by the Chinese army blowing up the South Manchuria Railway, but in fact, it was not the case at all, and it has been confirmed by various aspects. After the Army authorities learned of the doctor's remarks, they were furious and planned to order the doctor to make a detailed explanation. Now this matter has aroused very strong reactions in all aspects.</p>

<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 10th. Shiga, a member of the Seiyukai and Vice-Minister of Communications, visited Prime Minister Saito at 2 pm today and submitted his resignation, saying that the Prime Minister's policy of saving the current situation focuses on self-reliance. Today's rural relief does not have the power of self-reliance. If appropriate economic facilities are not provided, the rural areas will collapse. I am unwilling to remain in the government of this kind of policy. The Prime Minister tried his best to persuade him to stay, but Mr. Shiga's intention to resign was very firm. There is dissatisfaction within the Seiyukai with the policy of saving the current situation, so the future is very important.</p>

<p>Says Wang's Resignation Was Not Due to Negativity</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th. Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese envoy to the UK, was guided by British Foreign Secretary Simon to meet with the British Emperor at Buckingham Palace today. Guo told Reuters reporters that the British Emperor was extremely kind and had extensive knowledge, recalling his visit to Shanghai 50 years ago and paying close attention to the gradual recovery of the current situation in Shanghai and the gradual stabilization of the general political situation in China. Guo also said that he knew that Wang Jingwei did not sympathize with the negative policy of the northern soldiers towards the three northeastern provinces. He was not surprised to hear the news of the cabinet's resignation, but expected that the people of the country would definitely persuade Wang to stay in office and formulate a national policy that is compatible with the plan that should be adopted in North China.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th. Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese envoy to the UK, has made a very good impression here and is a welcome figure to the British newspapers. After meeting with the British Emperor, Guo told Reuters reporters that the British Emperor paid close attention to the Chinese army. He was very surprised to hear that there were army generals in China who were less than 30 years old, such as Zhang Xueliang. The British Emperor also said that this was not the case in Britain. British army generals are usually over 60 years old.</p>

<p>Attacked Police Stations and Government Offices at Night, Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Large Armies Gathered in the Capital, Telegrams and Telephones Cut Off</p>
<p>The Authorities Confident They Can Control the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Madrid, 10th. At 4 am this morning, royalists suddenly launched an uprising in Spain, led by retired royalist military officers. According to morning news, the situation in Seville is quite unfavorable. It seems that other places are unable to do anything. Local authorities are sufficient to control the situation. In Madrid, royalists fought with the police and riot police, killing six people.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 10th. At 5 am this morning, a restoration rebellion occurred here. Those who supported this move included a brigade of artillery. It is heard that three people have died in the fighting so far, and 50 people have been arrested. The government seems to be able to control the overall situation now. Initially, the rebels attacked police stations and government offices, but the police immediately took steps to defeat the attackers. After firing about 100 shots, they finally drove the rebels out of the government offices. Some of them were ambushed in the Ministry of Communications. Among those arrested were retired army generals and nobles. The capital is now a large military camp, because troops are stationed at all important points. The government has hurriedly gathered, and communication with foreign countries has been temporarily cut off, but it has now been restored. The government is deeply afraid of small responses, so this morning it has ordered the arrest of former King Alfonso, Solm, an Englishman who contracted the project, and some former bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Hengtai, 10th. According to news received from Madrid here, a mutiny suddenly occurred in the Spanish capital and other cities and towns this morning. At present, ordinary telegrams and telephones in Madrid are not working, but it is reported that the government is still able to control the situation. The detailed situation is still being explored. It is only heard that a regiment of cavalry mutinied outside Madrid last night and marched towards the capital, apparently wanting to occupy the Ministry of the Army and the General Post and Telegraph Office. Therefore, the military police defending the post office hurriedly blocked the windows and opened fire to prevent them from advancing. It was not until tanks and machine gun teams came to the rescue that a war broke out. Three people died on both sides, and many were injured. Among those arrested was the Duke of Infantado. The true purpose of the rebellion is not yet clear. It is widely rumored that it was incited by the royalists. According to recent news, the riots have spread throughout the capital.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Madrid, 10th. At the beginning of the incident here today, a cavalry unit actually mutinied, led by many military figures from the monarchy era, and attacked many government offices in Beijing, such as the Wang family, the Ministry of the Army, and the Ministry of the Interior. These government offices are all surrounded by a square, and the people were panicked for a while. Fortunately, the security team (also known as the military police) was effective. Although they saw that the cavalry was very strong, they did not give in and immediately fired several volleys, finally driving back the rebels and arresting several officers. By 9 am this morning, the Minister of the Interior had announced that the situation in all parts of the country was under the control of the government and estimated that about 30 people were injured as a result of the shootout near the post office. Afterwards, important government officials telegraphed the President that the riots had been largely quelled and that the President did not have to return to Beijing. As for the number of arrests, it has reached 60 in the capital alone. The authorities are now searching for well-known royalist members, and it is expected that the number of those arrested will continue to increase.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Many Difficulties Still Ahead <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 9th. The British Imperial Economic Conference is now encountering real difficulties in fact. During the first week of the meeting, the optimism held by the self-governing territories has gradually cooled down. Although an agreement between Britain and the self-governing territories can eventually be reached, the representatives of the self-governing territories are afraid that none of them will be able to return home with the satisfaction of having their wishes fulfilled. The agreement between Britain and Canada, which was initially hoped to be easy to reach and could be a model for other self-governing territories, has now become a difficult problem to solve. Canada's proposals to Britain have been shuttling back and forth between the representatives of both sides several times, and they are still under consultation. Although both sides have clearly stated that there is no intention to obstruct, British Chief Representative Baldwin was criticized for being too weak in handling the negotiations on US debt. Now he does not want to take it lightly on the matter of duty-free imports of Canadian wheat and meat, so as to be attacked by domestic political enemies. If he easily allows it, Baldwin will not only be criticized by the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, but will also be scolded by those who have invested 100 million pounds in South American countries, because South America's export trade to Britain will be restricted as a result. Canada is particularly concerned about Britain's purchase of Russian goods and has asked Britain to ban the import of Russian timber into British territory, because ordinary imperial preferential treatment is not enough to make Canadian exports compete with Russia. The Monetary Committee of the Conference has almost miscarried and is unlikely to formulate special proposals, but only advocates international action to raise prices.</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang Felt Extremely Stung After Reading the Telegram</p>
<p>Song, Sun, and Others Spoke Extensively About Wang's Telegram</p>
<p>Zhang and Fang, Jiang, and Hu Visited Zhang Qun in Succession</p>
<p>The Various Political Committee Members in Beiping All Urged Zhang Not to Resign Firmly</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the publication of the telegrams regarding the resignation of Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, various parties in the Beiping area were quite shocked. The following is an investigation into the entire course of events and Zhang Xueliang's definite expressions, recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tense Atmosphere: Wang Jingwei's resignation telegram arrived in Beiping around 10 PM on the 6th. Zhang Xueliang was at Liu Zhe's private residence, casually chatting with Song Zheyuan, Gao Guizi, Sun Dianying, and others. Secretary-General Wu Jiaxiang brought the original telegram and personally presented it to Zhang. After reading it, Zhang felt extremely stung and immediately revealed a pessimistic attitude. He then passed the telegram to Song and the others to read. Song and the others, prioritizing public security, earnestly offered comfort and engaged in extensive discussion. Some believed it was the beginning of a political storm, an excuse to grandstand unrelated to the situation in North China. Others criticized President Wang for acting so casually. At the same time, there were proposals for the various armies to express their opinions. Song and Sun spoke particularly extensively. However, Zhang Xueliang believed the matter was of great importance and that his subordinates should not speak lightly. Around 12 AM, Zhang personally visited Zhang Qun, Chiang Kai-shek's representative, at the Beijing Hotel for a secret two-hour talk. Zhang Qun immediately telegraphed Nanjing and Wuhan to inquire about the truth and conveyed Zhang's intentions. Around 2 AM, Zhang returned to the Prince Shuncheng Mansion and convened key personnel such as Rong Zhen, Bao Wenwei, Zhu Guangmu, Liu Zhe, Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, Yu Xuezhong, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, Wu Jiaxiang, and Zhang Qun, for an all-night meeting. They decided to send a telegram to Wang Jingwei, offering an analysis, and another to Chiang Kai-shek requesting instructions. They also dispatched Bao Wenwei to Wuhan to meet with Chiang and present everything in person. Chiang's telegram was immediately drafted and sent. The telegram was quite lengthy and the wording sincere. The telegram to Wang explained his personal feelings and provided a detailed explanation of defense preparations and fundraising. The wording was quite tactful. The telegram had been drafted but not yet sent, as they planned to discuss it further before sending it. The meeting adjourned around 5 AM on the 7th. On the morning of the 7th, Zhang telegraphed the central government, deployed his subordinates, and prepared for the handover. Bao Wenwei was originally scheduled to fly to Wuhan on the 7th, but was unable to depart due to further consultations with Zhang. At 10 AM on the 7th, Fang Benren, Jiang Bocheng, Hu Ruoyu, and others went to the Beijing Hotel to discuss the matter with Zhang Qun. Together, they telegraphed Nanjing and Wuhan to inquire about everything, report on the situation in the North, and request instructions on the direction.</p>
<p>Political Committee Meeting: The Beiping Political Affairs Committee held a discussion meeting at the Prince Shuncheng Mansion at 5:30 PM on the 7th. Attendees included Zhang Xueliang, Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, Fu Zuoyi, Pang Bingxun, Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, Zhang Qun, Fang Benren, Jiang Bocheng, Jiang Menglin, Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuchang, Wang Shuhan, Zhou Zuomin, Xiong Xiling, Lu Dangping, Liu [blank], Tang Yu[blank] (represented by Tan Guohuan), and Han Fuqu (represented by Song Shiyan). As it was a discussion meeting, no chairman was elected. Zhang first reported on Wang's telegram and the content of the reply, expressing his resignation. After lengthy discussion, the committee members all urged Zhang not to insist on resigning, but Zhang's attitude was very firm, and he admitted his past mistakes. As a result, it was decided: (1) Zhang would telegraph Wang, resigning his position. The gist of the telegram to Wang was that after the September 18th Incident, the Northeast fell, and he should take responsibility and resign to apologize to the people. Future political affairs would be handled by the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, and military affairs by the Beiping Military Reorganization Committee. However, during this time of national crisis, President Wang bears the heavy responsibility of national administration and should not suddenly resign due to personal matters. He should immediately withdraw his resignation and continue to be responsible. (2) A telegram would be sent to Wang in the name of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, explaining the process of requesting financial assistance from the central government. The request was solely due to the financial difficulties in Rehe, and they only requested an allocation of one to two million, not five million per month, nor was it a case of using the guise of resistance against Japan to amass wealth. (3) Tan Guohuan would telegraph Tang Yulin, explaining the truth of the matter and that they would still find ways to assist with Rehe's financial difficulties. (4) The Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters would issue an order to the various subordinate troops, instructing them to focus on training and not be swayed by rumors.</p>
<p>Financial Issues: According to news from the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, Wang's telegram criticized Zhang Xueliang's financial demands in three aspects: (1) The demand for five million from the Ministry of Finance, with at least two million to be paid first. It is said that this was a decision made by the Political Affairs Committee, and Li Shizeng was publicly elected to go to Nanjing to negotiate. At the same time, Hu Ruoyu was also sent, but Hu has not yet departed. Li met with Wang and Song once and has already set sail for Europe, scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today or tomorrow. Therefore, it is clear that there was no formal negotiation. (2) The responsibility of the Ministry of Railways to raise two million. The process is said to be quite complex. Initially, the North had a certain urgent need and could not raise funds. The central government was also in dire straits, so it was proposed to allocate two million from a certain deposit of the Beining Railway, which was a transfer in nature. Zhang had initially entrusted Song Ziwen to negotiate with the Ministry of Railways on his behalf. Gu Mengyu had replied that he would help, but after a Zhang surname section chief was sent north once, the discussion suddenly changed. Only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan was approved to be borrowed from the bureau, and it was even said that the ministry needed funds and ordered the previously discussed two million to be remitted to the ministry, which led to some disputes. Recently, Zhang had telegraphed a certain minister about this matter, expressing considerable complaints. It is said that Wang heard about this, hence his decision to resign, but it is uncertain. However, Gu Mengyu's resignation is indeed related to this negotiation. (3) Raising three million to help Rehe. It is said that this was an expression of hope from a certain party and not a request from Zhang. Moreover, it was not a matter of raising funds every month.</p>
<p>Zhang Decided to Resign: The day after Zhang received Wang's telegram, someone met with Zhang Xueliang. According to him, Zhang said that after receiving Wang's telegram, he felt extremely pained and decided to resign. It is said that Zhang himself said that he had felt guilty since the September 18th Incident and had long lost the desire to hold his position, but due to the security of Beiping and Tianjin, he could not arbitrarily resign. Now that he had Wang's telegram, it paved the way for him to leave, how could he not be grateful? However, what he did not understand was that if Wang, as the leader of the party and the state, truly believed that Zhang's presence was hindering the implementation of the government's policies, he could simply issue a clear order to dismiss him to demonstrate his authority. If he believed that Zhang's presence in office was inconvenient for his policies, then a single messenger could order him to resign. Why use a roundabout method, merely losing the government's standing, treating the country's future like child's play? How could the people have faith in the government, and how could they avoid being ridiculed by foreigners? Moreover, many of the cited accusations did not conform to the facts, which was even more regrettable. Zhang also said that his reply telegram to Wang had already been drafted. In addition to defending against the various points regarding financial issues, the above two points were also mentioned. Someone also asked Zhang what he would do after resigning. It is said that Zhang said that for the time being, political affairs would be temporarily handed over to the Political Affairs Committee, and military affairs would be temporarily the responsibility of the Military Affairs Committee. He would also telegraph Chairman Chiang, hoping that Chiang himself could come to Beiping to preside over matters. He was willing to assist as a staff member. If Chiang could not come, he hoped that the government would send a senior official who could take responsibility in the North to Beiping, and he would also do his best to assist. In short, no matter what, he would not cause unrest in the region due to his personal advancement or retreat, adding to his own guilt. He would do his best to ensure that there was no slightest disturbance in the North. (August 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Detailed Information on the Communist Bandits' Incursions <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Kuang Jixun's Faction is Relatively Strong</p>
<p>The Kong and He Factions Are About to Be Eliminated. Hankou Correspondence: The Communist bandits in Hubei Province include Kuang Jixun in the east, Kong Hechong in the south, He Long in the center, Wang Bingnan in the west, and Cheng Kechun in the north, as well as local bandits, mutinous soldiers, and mixed troops under Wang Tai. The following is an investigation into the incursions of the various factions, with a general overview as follows:</p>
<p>Kuang Jixun's Faction: Among the Communist bandits in Hubei Province, the pseudo-Fourth Front Army has the strongest force, led by the notoriously fierce Kuang Jixun. They have infiltrated the counties in eastern Hubei, and the bandits on the border of Henan and Anhui are in contact with them and are also subject to their control. Most of the bandits are entrenched in Huang'an, and the entire county has been communized. The Soviet of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Province is located there. A part of their pseudo-25th Army has infiltrated Yaopoling in the north of Guangji County, attempting to unite with the bandits in southern Hubei. Liao Rongkun's division of the pseudo-25th Army is entrenched inside and outside Luotian County, as well as in the Dahe'an, Dongchongfan, [blank]jiashan, and Guijiashan areas, constantly encroaching on the border between Huanggang, Qishui, and Macheng, and attempting to unite with the bandits in Huoshan and Shangcheng counties. The pseudo-9th Division, 25th Division, and Chen Changhao, Xu Bingzhong, Deng Zhigao and other factions of the pseudo-4th Army 11th Division have infiltrated the Kouhe, Weijiadawan, Yaojiaji, Ta'ergang, and Tieshidun areas in Huangpi, attempting to attack the county seat. The pseudo-27th and 28th Divisions have infiltrated Huanggang from Huang'an, including the Zuojiatian, Lijiaji, Cangbu, [blank]Xiaopu, Pan[blank], Sandian, and Sanlifan areas. A part of the pseudo-Fourth Front Army has infiltrated the Qichun, Zhangjiabang, Wangtiantian, and Liugonghe areas. The pseudo-Independent Division Zhang Guotao, and the pseudo-guerrilla Independent Regiment have infiltrated Shunheji, Chengmagang, Xizhangdian, Baifengzui, and Qilipu in Macheng. They besieged the county seat on July 9th and were relieved on the 15th. On the 25th, the bandits from Anyu were added, and they launched a three-pronged counterattack, which was again relieved. At the beginning of this month, they besieged the county seat three times, and there is no confirmed report yet. It is said that the government army has dispatched heavy troops to block and suppress them in various ways and has begun a general offensive. Guangji, Luotian, Huangpi, Qichun, and Huanggang counties are also being suppressed by the stationed troops.</p>
<p>Kong Hechong's Faction: The Communist bandit pseudo-16th Army Kong Hechong faction is infiltrating the counties in southern Hubei. Their nest is in Longgang and Yanxia, which belong to Yangxin County. The two divisions of Kong's department, Zhang Tao and Guo Ziming, constantly infiltrate Daban, Paishi, Sanxikou, Xiaojipu, and Taipingtang. Those in Daye are a part of Guo Ziming and Ji Zhendong's department of the pseudo-9th Division, infiltrating Huayoushu, Bajiaoting, and Fantanpu. Those in Echeng are a part of Guo and the two factions of peasant bandits Zhang Zhi and Zhang Songru, infiltrating Yanglinqiao and Maojiapu. Those in Tongshan are the entire pseudo-16th Army Independent 3rd Division Xu Jinmen, and the pseudo-guerrilla team and Red Guards, entrenched in Fushi, Hengtan, and Sanjiejian. On July 13th, they captured the county seat in six routes, but it was soon recovered by reinforcements, suffering heavy losses and fleeing back to their old nest. Those in Xianning are Ye Jinbo's department of the pseudo-Garrison Division, and the pseudo-guerrilla team and Red Guards, entrenched in Baidun, Chadi Pu, Gaocha Ping, Feiji Dun, and Changbu Tang, attempting to destroy the Xiang-E Railway. Those in Tongcheng are Shen Guozhen and Liu Yongkang's faction of Kong's department, entrenched in the Huangpao Mountain and Matou areas. Chongyang has the pseudo-Independent 2nd Division, and Pubei has the remnants of Xiong Mingjie. The bandits in Chongyang are entrenched in Dayuan'an and the Shalong Bridge of Xiushui. The bandits in Pubei are hiding in Zhongxinpong, Sanshanyuan, and Luoja, and dare not openly harm people. Because the above parts of Kong's banditry are united with the bandits on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, their momentum is quite large. In fact, Kong's direct subordinates in Hubei are only seven or eight thousand people, and the number of guns is only over three thousand.</p>
<p>He Long's Bandit Faction: The Communist bandit pseudo-26th Army He Long department, under the jurisdiction of the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd divisions, hides between Tianmen, Qianjiang, Jingmen, and Mianyang in central Hubei. Duan Dechang is also his subordinate. That area is the Xiang River basin, and the Diaowen Lake in Hanchuan County on the north bank is its base. Honghu, which belongs to Mianyang, and Qianjiang and other counties on the south bank are also the location of nests. It is estimated that He Ying (female bandit), Peng Guocai, and Duan Dechang are the three factions that harass Mianyang, Honghu, Fengkou, Guomiao Wan, Tuochuanbu, Shahu, Yanglindu, and Magangfu Chang, attempting to attack Tonghaikou. The bandits who harass Tianmen, Yuxinhe, Huibutou, Jingtang, Lushi, Changshou'an, and Huatai are He Long's direct troops and most of Duan Dechang's pseudo-9th Division. Those entrenched in Qianjiang are the pseudo-8th Division and a part of the 9th Division. Jianli is a part of the pseudo-8th Division, the pseudo-guerrilla team, and the Red Guards. The river and streams are the remnants of Yu Huaxin. Jingshan is Duan Yulin's troops, Zhongxiang is a part of the pseudo-9th Division, and Jingmen and Jiangling are the troops of Jiang Shangjian and Gongchen, uniting the local bandits Li Ziqing and Wu Zhifu. This faction has suffered heavy losses after being suppressed by the army. Diaowen Lake, Yuxinhe, Huibutou, and Qianjiang County have been recovered by the government forces. The bandit divisions 8 and 9 have completely collapsed. Only He Long led the Fourth Regiment of the Seventh Division and fled into the Honghu old nest. There are no more than 5,000 bandits. It should not be far from cleaning up and sweeping the courts. In addition, within the area of central Hubei, there are also three factions of communist bandits Hou Yuting, Chen Zhengyu, and Li Tieqing, who constantly harass the Zhurushan, Guojiajing, and Zhengjiaban of Hanyang County, and some of them also harass Xiaosigou and Huanglingji. It is not known whether they are subordinate to He Long.</p>
<p>Wang Bingnan's Faction: The Communist Bandit Pseudo-First Teaching Division Commander Wang Bingnan's faction, and the factions of Hu Di and Zeng Siwen, are entrenched in Badong, Changyang, Wufeng, Hefeng, and Jianshi counties in western Hubei. Wang Bing's troops have more power. Wang is located at the junction of Bachang in Jiangnan, and Hu is located in Qinglong Erxi in Jiangbei. They had repeatedly been searched after the Hou Fang An in Jianshi, and Jiangbei has been recovered. The Jiangnan big faction has also been defeated. They are now all lurking in the mountains and forests and dare not show off again. As for the pseudo</p>
<p>The West Hubei Guerrilla Brigade has infiltrated the Yangjia Yuan, Xindianzi, and Yinjiawan areas of Songzi. After being besieged by the army, they have collapsed and are no longer a force.</p>
<p>Cheng Kechun's Faction: The Cheng bandits are entrenched in the Zhaoyang area. After being broken by Fan Shisheng's troops in northern Hubei many times, their strength was completely lost. Now there are only more than a hundred people and forty or fifty guns. There are also factions such as Wei Tansheng and Li Junmin in Xiaogan County, with about fifty or sixty people and twenty or thirty guns. It is said that this faction is in contact with the bandits in eastern Hubei, and Wei and Li are both members of Kuang Bandit's party.</p>
<p>Wang Tai's Bandit Faction: The Henan bandit Wang Tai, calling himself the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, is harassing Fang County, Zhushan, and Zhuxi counties. Wang's division commander</p>
<p>Wei Guoshu occupies Zhushan County and the four surrounding areas. Most of Wang's troops and Niu [blank]chun's troops occupy Zhuxi. The two troops often fight with each other. There are also Gu Dasheng, Ma Guojun, Xiao Dashao, and Liu Zhaigong's factions harassing the border between Sui County and Ying Mountain. The local bandits include Yang Wenjie, Yu in Xiangyang.</p>
<p>Hua Feng, Li Xuelin, Wang Xindian, Yue Mingda, and Zhang Hengjin.</p>
<p>Each faction, Baokang has Li Guangyi and Wei Junbo, Yun County has Zhang Laosi, Wang Lao Jiu, and Hong Longbao, and Yunxi has Li Xingwu and Hong Wuzi.</p>
<p>Zhao Yilin's Faction: In addition to the Communist bandits, local bandits, Henan bandits, and Shaanxi bandits, there are also so-called secret society bandits. This only exists in western Hubei. In Yichang, it is called the Huangxiang Society, and the leader is Zhao Yilin, secretly active in the Wuduhuo Heiyuan Township and other places in the county. In Lichuan, it is called the Badeh Society, and the bandit leader is Duan Wenxiang, with about hundreds of people and more than a hundred guns, constantly harassing Taipingzhen and Zhonglu Street.</p>
<p>Communist Bandit Organization: The places where bandits reach have a wide variety of institutions. In the direction of West Hubei, there is the Central Sub-Bureau, the highest organ commanding the red bandits in the southwest provinces. The governments of Hunan and Hubei provinces are located in Honghu</p>
<p>There are also organizations such as pseudo-Central Branch School, arsenal, hospital, radio station, and customs. The Soviet of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces is located in Shangcheng (southern Henan) and Huang'an. There is a Soviet in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in Xiushui, (Jiangxi Province) and each county has a county Soviet, the district has a district Soviet, and the township has a township Soviet. There are also land committees, economic committees, anti-suppression committees, comfort teams, peasant mutual aid societies, and children's groups. They are all local ruffians and ignorant people who use spears, knives, and spears as weapons and are used by the Communist bandits. Therefore, their ravages throughout the province and the poisoning of the local area are very fierce. (August 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Anhui Province <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<h3 id="e105">Jinping County will be established <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Divide the recovered bandit areas into county areas.</p>
<p>The county seat is located in Jinjiazhai, Liu'an. Anqing Correspondence: Anhui Province originally had sixty counties. Recently, the Provincial Government established Jiashan County in Sanjie Town, the junction of Chuzhou, Lai'an, Dingyuan, and Xuyi counties, and appointed former Provincial Party Committee Li Weitang as the county establishment preparation member. Now, Liao Weipu and other citizens of Liu Duo Brigade have submitted a report to the Provincial Government, requesting the establishment of a new county in the Jinjiazhai area of the county, that is, Jinjiazhai as the new county seat. The northeast is to be filled with the land west of Mabao belonging to Liu'an. The south follows the Dabie Mountain, and the north branches from Baoyun Mountain, Foxiangzhai, and San cengnao, west to Songziguan, as the southeast area of the new county. It is more northward from Songziguan through the Feiqishan of Shangcheng County, Henan Province, along the Jingangtai to Dog Ridge, and transferred to the territory of Gushi County in Henan Province, to reach the southern part of Huoqiu in Anhui, as the northwest area of the new county. In summary, the total area, population, and products of the entire county have the possibility of establishing a new county. The establishment of the new county is directly under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Provincial Government, so as to exercise jurisdiction, so that the remote areas become the hinterland, and the thorns become the open flat. Politics has a center, and suppression is convenient. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government believed that the various sections submitted by the citizens were still factual, and has ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to verify and report. It is also heard that the Provincial Government intends to use the two characters Jinping for the name of the new county. As for the situation in Jinjiazhai, it is more than 200 li north of Huoqiu, 240 li northeast of Liu'an, 180 li west of Huoshan, 180 li south of Macheng in Hubei Province, 130 li northwest of Shangcheng in Henan Province, and more than 200 li from Gushi. The Dabie Mountains run across the borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. The southwest is the source of the Shi River, and the southeast is the source of the Bi River, and Jinjiazhai is located in the middle. In the past, political power was not easy to extend into, causing it to be occupied by Communist bandits. It was also not easy for the counties to suppress it. The provincial army went to aid, but was restricted by the provincial boundary, watching and not advancing, causing harm to this day, and becoming the base of the Communist bandits, almost becoming the abandoned land of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. This time, the army suppressed, and the area has been recovered, taking the people out of the water and fire, and returning to the seat. If the establishment of the county is realized, then it will not be easy for the Communist bandits to covet it. (August 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e107">Continued Interrogation Proceedings <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Niu Lan Still Requests Transfer to Shanghai for Trial: The Jiangsu Higher Court continued the trial of Niu Lan and his wife for endangering the Republic of China at 8:00 AM on August 10th at the Jiangning District Court. The trial was still presided over by Li Mian, the presiding judge of the Jiangsu Higher Court, along with judges Yin Rixu and Lin Zemin, prosecutor Zhu, and clerk Wu Daquan. Representatives from various agencies and organizations were present to observe the proceedings. The court session began at 8:40 AM. After the judges took their seats, they ordered the Niu couple to be brought from the detention center. Niu was wearing a beige suit, while Wang Deli had on a black silk Chinese-style cheongsam and Chinese cloth-soled shoes. Their spirits and complexions were better than before the hunger strike. The presiding judge first addressed Niu, stating that the trial would continue today and that he must answer the questions asked. Niu, because the Chen translator could not accurately convey his true intentions, requested that the previous translator, Yang, be present in court. The court approved this request and ordered the bailiff to immediately telegraph for Yang to come to court, and then continued the interrogation. (Presiding Judge asked) Are you 34 years old? What is your nationality? Niu stated that the court could not try the case. If the trial was being conducted under the order of the Ministry of Justice, it was incorrect. (Presiding Judge) If you do not answer, a judgment can be made. (Niu) There are three reasons for transferring the trial to Shanghai: (1) In Shanghai, experts can be hired to authenticate the written records. (2) In Shanghai, reliable witnesses can be found. (3) In Shanghai, reputable lawyers can be hired, and evidence can be photographed. (Presiding Judge) Your previous requests for transfer have been rejected. The jurisdiction has been determined, and this court should conduct the trial. If you want to hire reputable lawyers, any lawyer practicing in this court can be hired. (Niu) Many pieces of evidence reported in the newspapers are not in my own handwriting. This matter should be photographed by a lawyer for record. (Presiding Judge) Since it was not written by you, you can find witnesses. (Niu) I do not wish to hire a Chinese lawyer. I should be allowed to invite Fess to appear in court. (Presiding Judge) There are many reputable lawyers in China. Anyone practicing within this court can be hired. There is no need to hire a lawyer in Shanghai. (Niu) I am not afraid of being judged by an independent body, but I do not want the judicial authorities to joke around. (Presiding Judge) This court has the authority to try this case. Why do you say we are joking around? (Niu) This court is not an independent court, and it does not have jurisdiction over this case. I do not wish to answer, but I declare that, according to Article 301 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I reserve the right to make a final statement. (Presiding Judge) Regarding your three reasons for requesting a transfer: first, you can hire reputable lawyers; second, any evidence can be presented in this court; third, if you have anyone who can authenticate the written records, you can invite them. (Niu) I do not wish to say much now. Please reserve my right to make a final statement. (Presiding Judge) If you do not speak, you can be convicted under Article 310 of the Criminal Law. (Presiding Judge) What is your nationality? (Presiding Judge) Where do you live? (Presiding Judge) What do you do for a living? (Presiding Judge) When did you come to China? (Presiding Judge) Where did you live when you first came to China? (Presiding Judge) After you were arrested, you initially said you were Belgian to the police. Later, when asked, the Belgian consulate said you were not. (Presiding Judge) You also said you were Swiss. When asked, the Swiss consulate also said you were not. From these two points of view, you are a person from a country without a treaty. (Presiding Judge) Your nationality is unclear. If you do not say, then you are a person from a country without a treaty. (Presiding Judge) People from countries without treaties are subject to Chinese law. (Presiding Judge) When did you come to Shanghai? (Presiding Judge) Did you state in the Second Branch of the High Court that you came to Shanghai on March 15, 1919? Is that correct? (Presiding Judge) How exactly did you come to China? (Presiding Judge) Didn't you say that you came from Berlin through Moscow, from Moscow to Harbin, from Harbin to Dalian, and from Dalian to Shanghai? (Presiding Judge) What exactly did you do in Shanghai? (Presiding Judge) You said you came to Shanghai to be a teacher. If you were a teacher, why did you have four residences? (1) 49 Nanjing Road, (2) 74 West Garden, Yuyuan Road, (3) 66 Hart Road, (4) 235 Sichuan Road. (Presiding Judge) Are these four residences all where you lived, or were they your offices, or where Wang Deli lived? (Presiding Judge) If you say you were a teacher, why did you rent so many houses? (Presiding Judge) In your statement to the Second Branch of the High Court, you said you came to Shanghai for business, and only later said you were a teacher. (Presiding Judge) If you were in business, what kind of business did you do? Did you have contact with Chinese people? Who were they? If you were in business, was it personal or a company? Companies have their logos, and individuals also have their marks. (Presiding Judge) You also said that the foreign company was located in Beijing. Beijing is a very large place. Where exactly was it located? What kind of business was it? (Presiding Judge) You previously stated that you were engaged in import and export trade. What kind of trade was it? (Presiding Judge) Looking at it this way, the business you did cannot be explained clearly. It is evident that you were not in business. (Presiding Judge) If you do not answer today, you are hurting yourself. (Presiding Judge) Who is Wang Deli to you? (Presiding Judge) According to you, you are husband and wife. Can you produce a marriage certificate? If you cannot produce a certificate, it is evident that you are not husband and wife. (Presiding Judge) On March 15, the day you were arrested, if you had been honest, why did you throw the Zhaofeng door tickets and car tickets out of the car window? (Presiding Judge) Your residence was discovered in the note thrown from your body. (Presiding Judge) Did you rent the Nanjing Road house yourself? (Presiding Judge) According to you, An Lisheng rented it. Can the person An Lisheng be found now? (Presiding Judge) You said that An Lisheng lived in room C on Nanjing Road. Why can't An Lisheng be found? (Presiding Judge) Pan A'da, who takes care of the house, has testified that you give him four yuan a month to watch the house. (Presiding Judge) When the police arrived, Pan A'da pointed out that An Lisheng was you, and you called him Mr. An Lisheng. (Presiding Judge) The landlord, Ding Jingsheng, said that you also paid the monthly rent, and you called him An Lisheng. (Presiding Judge) If you say that the house was rented by An Lisheng, you should hand over An Lisheng. If you cannot hand him over, since there are testimonies from Pan and Ding, then you are An Lisheng. (Presiding Judge) Three iron boxes were found in the small cabinet. The evidence of your crimes was found in the third box. (Presiding Judge) One box contained evidence of endangering the Republic of China, and another box contained US dollars. (Presiding Judge) You said at the time to the police that there were 1,100 US dollars. After investigation, there were only 823 dollars, and they were sealed in envelopes. (At this point, Niu was looking at the three small boxes repeatedly while listening to the translator.) (Presiding Judge) You said that the money in the box was short, perhaps used by An Lisheng at the time. (Presiding Judge) Now I ask, are the boxes yours? If they are not yours, how do you know there is money inside? (Presiding Judge) At the time, you said that you wanted to take the US dollars in the box to pay the lawyer's fees. (Presiding Judge) If the money is not yours, how can you take it to pay the lawyer's fees? (Presiding Judge) Since you know how much money there is and can dispose of it yourself, then it is evident that the boxes are yours and the money is also yours. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Motivation for Dredging the City River: Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been extremely dry, and there has been a prolonged drought. The amount of water in the tides has decreased significantly. The city river has not been dredged for many years and has almost become a ditch. Even when there are occasional tides, the water is murky and unsuitable for drinking. The public increasingly feels the lack of water. Wang, a member of the County Executive Committee, proposed at the regular meeting of the committee to dredge the city river for relief. This proposal was forwarded to the county government for handling. After approving the proposal, County Magistrate Shen immediately ordered the First District Office to work with the Construction and Public Security Bureaus to devise a plan and actively carry it out. However, the city river was last dredged in 1914. At that time, in addition to donations, the funds were still far short, and loans were obtained from the financial community. This was handled by the Municipal Office. Later, the accounts were lost and have not been settled. Although the current dredging is essential, how to raise the dredging funds will be decided after the District Office convenes discussions with the Construction and Public Security Bureaus.</p>

<p>Provincial Party Headquarters Thoroughly Investigates Party Disputes: The fact that Wu County Party Committee members Zhu Yanliang, Zhou Shanfu, and Liao Yingzhong, among others, were accused by various district party committees of collecting fees from opium dens, gambling houses, and brothels, and of embezzling party funds, has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that party member Chen Weizhi was designated by the party committee as a suspected reactionary and was arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and detention. On the 9th, he was transferred to the province for further investigation. In addition, party member Gao Junxiao was also arrested yesterday morning and temporarily detained in the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, various district party committees urgently telegraphed the Provincial Party Headquarters to complain about the party committee's arbitrary arrests of party members. Currently, the Provincial Party Headquarters dispatched Lu Baolin to Suzhou on the 9th to investigate the facts. After arriving in Suzhou, Lu investigated the case files and has obtained considerable evidence. Lu also took the opportunity to investigate the case of mutual bribery accusations between the Anti-Japanese Association and the County Party Committee. Party members from various districts of Wu County have been appealing to Lu in person to uphold justice. Lu is scheduled to return to the province on the 10th to report his findings.</p>
<p>Petition to Postpone the Implementation of the Special Construction Tax: The Finance and Construction Bureaus of Wu County, with the approval of the Provincial Department, were scheduled to implement a special construction tax on slaughter tax in Wu County starting on the 16th of this month. However, the Fresh Meat Industry Association, noting that education and other taxes are already levied on the slaughter tax, sent a letter to the Education Association, which forwarded it to the county government, requesting a postponement of the special construction tax.</p>

<p>Chambers of Commerce from Various Counties Hold Meeting in Wuxi: The Chambers of Commerce of the counties formerly under the Changzhou Prefecture held a meeting at the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 9th to discuss the business tax issue. More than 30 people attended, including Lin Junbao and Yu Yicheng from Wujin, Hua Shaochun and Cai Rong from Wuxi, Zhu Zhongjing from Yixing, Wu Shuying from Jiangyin, and Zhu Lifu from Jingjiang. The resolutions on key issues were as follows: (1) Regarding the first of the six opinions proposed by the Chamber of Commerce Federation, requesting a reduction in the tax rate, the Provincial Government did not adopt the opinion of the Higher Chamber of Commerce Federation, which stated that merchants were already finding it difficult to bear the burden. Instead, new regulations were issued, which are too burdensome for merchants. It was resolved to continue to vigorously advocate for the reduction. (2) Articles 8, 20, and 25 of the Provisional Regulations on Business Tax in Jiangsu Province, as well as Chapter 6 on penalties, should be revised. The standards for revision are: (A) Article 8: All businesses should keep an annual total account book, and at the beginning of each business year, allow personnel from the Business Tax Bureau to conduct investigations. (B) Article 20: Please delete the 19 characters "(or those who temporarily establish a main branch or sub-branch at the place of production to purchase goods)". (C) Article 25: Please delete the word "promotion." (D) Chapter 6 on penalties: The original penalties are too severe and should be reduced across the board. (3) Article 21 of the original Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax in Jiangsu Province should be added to the new regulations. (4) Regarding the request from various industries to reduce the tax rate, the Chamber of Commerce Federation should vigorously advocate for it. (5) Oil, salt, firewood, charcoal, coal, and miscellaneous grains are essential daily necessities for the people. Please follow the example of rice and wheat and change the tax to two per thousand. (6) Cotton yarn and wheat are both raw materials for yarn and flour. It is inappropriate to levy taxes on the same item twice, which hinders the principle of unified taxation. Please remove them. (7) Cotton yarn weaving is the raw material for manufacturing daily necessities and has already been subject to unified taxation. When selling, please reduce the tax to two per thousand. The above cases have been sorted out separately and submitted to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the Zhenjiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation today (the 11th) for joint discussion.</p>
<p>Strange Murder Case: Coffin Opened for Examination: In the Nanqian Village area of the Eleventh District of the county, Wang, the wife of villager Gu Afu, died suddenly on June 23 while returning home from her mother's house in Dongshantou, after falling into the river at Sushe Bridge, resulting in a strange murder case. Wang Guanshun, the brother of the deceased, reported the incident to the County Court Prosecutor's Office some days ago, requesting an examination and pointing to Zhu Genquan as the murderer. After Prosecutor Shen opened the court, he ordered the bailiff Wu Zixin to go to the countryside and supervise Wang Guanshun, Gu Afu, and others to transport the coffin to the city the day before yesterday. The murderer Zhu Genquan, together with witnesses Zhang and Lu Xiangkun, voluntarily turned themselves in the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the coffin was opened for examination at the Shengdi Temple in Huishan.

<p>Promoting National Prestige and Patriotism Among Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>| Li Huitang and Chen Zhenhe Lead Separate Teams | The South China and Hong Kong Football Teams, strong forces from our nation, have been touring and competing in various overseas locations. Wherever they go, their reputation spreads far and wide, and they are deeply loved by overseas Chinese. Here is a summary of the recent performances of both teams, to satisfy the thirst of football fans at home.</p>
<p>South China Loses to Itini</p>
<p>The Result is Two to Three After defeating the Long Xuan team by a score of three to zero, the South China team's reputation for invincibility spread far and wide. On July 19th, they competed against the Itini team, the current champion of Bandung.</p>
<p>An Unintentional Loss At 4:30 PM, the signal was given, and both teams launched fierce attacks. Within just one minute, Itini's right winger, Horal, dribbled the ball along the side, deep into South China's left defense. He then kicked the ball sharply towards the center, and unintentionally, the ball landed in the left corner of the goal. Goalkeeper Zhou noticed and tried to save it, but the ball</p>
<p>hit the post and bounced in. South China unfortunately conceded the first goal.</p>
<p>Illegal and Invalid Itini scored a lucky goal, but fortune did not favor them. Li Huitang took the lead, broke through the defense, and entered the street to knock on the gate. Seeing that reinforcements were not arriving, the opposing goalkeeper rushed out to meet him, but was dodged by General Li, who shot straight at the goal. At that moment, Li Yichen was eager to win and illegally entered the area. The referee ruled that he was offside, and the goal was disallowed. The first half ended with a score of zero to</p>
<p>one against South China.</p>
<p>Beyond Imagination In the second half, the attacks and defenses became even more intense. Not</p>
<p>one minute later, the opposing left winger sneaked in and passed the ball to the center. Chen, the right defender, did not defend with his life and was struck in the chest by the opposing right inside, resulting in another goal. South China's reputation for invincibility began to shake. They launched attacks on all fronts to regain lost ground. Li Yichen made a significant contribution, scoring one goal. Li Huitang directed the entire army, penetrating deep into enemy territory. Li scored with a ground shot, making it two to two.</p>
<p>Lost Due to Penalty Kick After the tie, our army's momentum increased even further.</p>
<p>The opposing team was under pressure from both sides, and it seemed likely that we would turn the tie into a victory. Li Huitang, with the help of Ye Beihua, made a solo run, dodging all the defenders. The opposing goalkeeper rushed out to meet him, but Li cleverly outmaneuvered him, gently sending the ball towards the right corner of the goal. However, the ball moved slowly due to the mud, and was eventually saved by the opposing team. Subsequently, South China was in trouble, and Tan Jiangbai touched the ball with his hand while clearing it, resulting in a penalty kick. The kick was successful, and the result was two</p>
<p>to three, a loss.</p>

<p>Huang Jiliang South China Wins Against Long Team Four to Zero</p>
<p>The Next Day, They Crushed the Zhonglian Team Eight to One After arriving in Longzhong, the South China army competed against the Longdi team the next day.</p>
<p>South China Unleashes Its Power The teams lined up and the battle began. After fifteen minutes of fighting, there was no winner. Li Huitang led his army deep into enemy territory, but seeing the strong defense, there was no chance to sneak through. He had to retreat and pass the ball to Huang Meishun, who shot the ball into the goal, opening the scoring. From then on, South China dominated the entire field. Soon after, Li Huitang made a brilliant shot, hitting the corner of the net, resulting in a score of two to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>Victory with Ten Men In the second half, the Long team fought desperately, launching attacks on all</p>
<p>fronts. However, they were unsuccessful due to the solid defense. South China, on the other hand, took the opportunity to attack. Ye Beihua was sent off the field, and South China had to play with ten men. Time flew by, and with only five minutes left, Li Huitang made a flying pass, scoring a goal. Following</p>
<p>that, Li Yichen also scored a goal, resulting in a four to zero victory. The next day, South</p>
<p>China crushed the Zhonglian team by a score of eight to one.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Draws with Japanese Team | The Result is Two to Two | The Next Day, They Defeated the Qinglian Team Three to Zero The Hong Kong team has an average strength, and with the help of Li Huiguan, their reputation has grown even further. On July 23rd, they competed against the United Team of Zhitang-Riyer, creating a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>A Poor Start The Governor of Riyer Province entered the field to officiate the opening ceremony. The Hong Kong team made a feint and charged straight in. Li Huiguan and Li Hongqing shot one after the other, but both missed. They returned to the attack, and Zheng Shaokang fired a series of tricky shots, but all were blocked by the enemy. The enemy's goal was under constant pressure, but because they lacked accurate shooters, all opportunities were lost. The first</p>
<p>half ended with a score of zero to one, a defeat.</p>
<p>Finally a Draw In the second half, Chen Zhenhe moved forward to play center forward.</p>
<p>The forward line became very active. The Hong Kong team still dominated as they did in the first half, but their goal-scoring skills were lacking, and their efforts often fell short. Once, Chen, the center forward, passed the ball to Li Huiguan, who kicked it. The ball accidentally hit Li Hongqing's foot and bounced in, making it one to one. After the Hong Kong team regained the lead, victory seemed within their grasp. As soon as the ball was restarted, they surrounded the Japanese team again. Before long, they scored another goal, turning the tie into a victory. Suddenly, their defense was exposed, and the opposing team took the opportunity to score, making it two to two again. The next day, the Hong Kong team defeated the Qinglian team three to zero. Tang Kun Li Hongqing</p>

It is hoped that they can register today at Jimeishi Western Restaurant, next to the Naval YMCA at 224 Sichuan Road, and receive a pass. Yu Binqi warns Chinese swimmers, there will be many Chinese participants in this competition, and of course, there will be many masters. However, there will also be many people who think that they can participate just because they have a pass. It is hoped that these people will</p>

<p>Since the active preparation of Lehua Girls' Middle School on Foch Road, the internal arrangements have been completed. Since holding a broadcast speech at the Great China Radio Station, the school's enthusiasm for women's education has gained sympathy from all sides. Therefore, in recent days, dozens of people have come from all over to inquire and register every day. Yesterday was the fifth broadcast speech, and the speaker was Xu Gongmei, the director of teaching affairs of the school, who spoke on the topic of "The Reform Movement of Chinese Women's Education," explaining the shortcomings of women's education in the past, the path of reform in the future, and the purpose of Lehua Girls' Middle School's administration.

<p>78. The ancient temple is, after all, a strange thing. Gradually, it attracted the attention of the people in the city. Some people initially came to see the scenery, but suddenly discovered this strange thing, just like Columbus discovered the New World. They told others, spreading the word from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, so that visitors came in an endless stream, making me busy all day with boiling water, making tea, and receiving guests, sweating profusely. I am not afraid of sweating, but what I fear is that my sweat will be shed in vain. The way they glanced at the flowers from horseback was to treat our ancient temple as the Great World for fun. I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to them about the meaning of various activities, so that they would take some seeds and scatter them elsewhere. Who knew that I would always be disappointed? They always asked me, "How many students do you have here? How many teachers are there? What is the annual budget?" My tongue followed me and was not very comfortable, having to answer these monotonous and uninteresting words all day long.</p>
<p>Today was an unprecedented day. An economics PhD, Mr. Tang, came. Hearing that we were running a rural work-study program, he came specially to visit. He asked in great detail, and I answered with great enthusiasm. It was truly a pleasure. My tongue can be considered happy today; it has more than compensated for many days of futility. Finally, Dr. Tang gave me a shocking question: "Now is a world of machines. Things made by machines are cheap and good. Handicrafts can never compete with them. You want to grow your own cotton, spin your own yarn, weave your own cloth, and make your own cotton clothes to wear. This is indeed a beautiful ideal, but relying on the power of your ancient temple alone, you can only do wooden machine handicrafts. How can you compete with machine-made products? Machine-made products are cheap and good, while yours are expensive and rough. How can you sell them? Handicrafts are crushed by machines. How can you promote them? The ancient temple should lead farmers to learn from foreign countries head-on. Learning from foreign countries means learning the latest machines from foreign countries. How can you go backwards?" I was stunned by Dr. Tang's question, simply defeated by it. It doesn't matter. This is a good opportunity for me to learn. I have never been so embarrassed as I am today. I believe that the more embarrassed I am, the more substantial my progress will be. Mr. Zhu's and Dr. Tang's views are diametrically opposed. One of them must be wrong. I must quickly invite Mr. Zhu to come so that they can have a debate. No matter who is right, I will always gain some knowledge. (Dr. Tang, please sit for a while. I will go and find Teacher Zhu to talk to you.)</p>

<h3 id="e134">Wang Jingwei's Secret Whereabouts <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Representative Was Sent to Wuhan to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>The Political Situation Suddenly Becomes Depressed, and All Parties Are Planning Solutions</p>
<p>Song Ziwen States That Chiang Still Insists on Resolutely Persuading Wang to Remain as President of the Executive Yuan. After Wang Jingwei resigned from his position as President of the Executive Yuan, due to the nature of a responsible cabinet, the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan also jointly resigned. As of yesterday, the Central Government had not yet issued any statement. Wang moved out of Noel Hospital the night before last, and his whereabouts are extremely secret. Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, and others did not meet with him yesterday. Therefore, the political situation has shifted from a major upheaval to a state of depression. The realization of new developments will still require a considerable amount of time. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, sent another telegram to Wang, earnestly urging him to stay and hoping to choose a place to meet in person to discuss everything. Wang sent his secretary, Tang Youren, by plane to Wuhan at 8:00 AM yesterday to represent Wang in meeting with Chiang and to explain the difficulties of his resignation. Tang is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane at 3:00 PM today to report back. It is rumored that Chiang telegraphed Song to go to Nanjing immediately to maintain government affairs. This reporter met with Song yesterday, and Song denied this rumor, saying that he would not go to Nanjing for the time being. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Central Government Has Not Yet Made a Statement. The Central Government Has Not Yet Made Any Statement Regarding the Joint Resignation of the Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions of the Executive Yuan. According to Mayor Wu, a telegram of consolation will be sent to Shanghai within the next few days, earnestly requesting the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan to return to their posts and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibilities.</p>
<p>Chiang Sends Another Telegram to Wang Urging Him to Stay. Since Receiving Telegrams of Resignation From President Wang and the Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission Originally Intended to Come to Shanghai Immediately to Personally Request Them to Return to Nanjing and Resume Their Posts. However, Because of His Involvement in Military Affairs of Suppressing Bandits, He Could Not Leave Wuhan. Therefore, He Specifically Telegraphed Wang, Earnestly Requesting Him to Go to Wuhan Immediately to Discuss Everything in Person. After Receiving This Telegram the Day Before Yesterday, Wang Sent Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, to Wuhan Yesterday Morning to Represent Wang in Meeting with Chiang.</p>
<p>Tang Youren Flies to Wuhan Yesterday. Tang Youren Went to Longhua Airport at 8:00 AM Yesterday Morning and Took a China National Aviation Corporation Plane to Fly From Shanghai to Wuhan to Meet with Chiang. It Is Said That Chairman Chiang Summoned Wang to Wuhan to Discuss the Issue of Wang's Return to His Post, and It Is Understood That Tang Is Scheduled to Return to Shanghai at 3:00 PM Today.</p>
<p>Wang's Whereabouts Are Secret. On the Evening of the Eighth, Wang Moved From His Residence on Rue Bourgeois to Noel Hospital on Avenue Joffre to Avoid Guests. It Is Now Learned That Wang Moved Out of the Hospital the Night Before Last. As for Where He Moved To, It Is Very Secret, and Outsiders Have No Way of Finding Out. According to Wang's Entourage, Wang Left Shanghai the Night Before Last to Rest in a Quiet Place. This Reporter Asked Mayor Wu About This Matter Yesterday, and Wu Denied It, Saying That Wang Is Still Staying in Shanghai, but His Residence Is Very Secret. It Was Also Learned That Key Figures From the Central Government and Mayor Wu Tiecheng Originally Intended to Meet with Wang Yesterday Afternoon to Persuade Him to Stay, but Wang's Attitude Remains Firm, and His Whereabouts Are Secret, so They Have Not Been Able to Meet With Him. According to Wang's Residence, Wang Left Shanghai Last Night to Rest Elsewhere. Wang Has Refused to See Guests for the Past Two Days, and There Is Also Considerable Doubt That Wang Has Left Shanghai for Another Place. According to Mayor Wu, Although Chairman Lin Has Telegraphed Wang to Go to Lushan for a Meeting, Mr. Wang Stated That He Is Unwilling to Start His Journey Until the Central Government Approves His Resignation. Therefore, It Can Be Concluded That Wang Will Still Stay in Shanghai in the Next Few Days and Will Definitely Not Go Elsewhere.</p>
<p>Opinions of Various Central Committee Members. Central Committee Members Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, and Others in Shanghai Believe That Wang's Attitude Is Firm, and the Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions Have Also Submitted Their Joint Resignations. They Fear That the Delay Will Be Too Long, Which Will Hinder the Progress of Central Government Affairs. After Discussions Over the Past Two Days, They Decided to Proceed Separately to Find a Solution. That Is, on the One Hand, They Will Try to Find an Appropriate Solution to the Northeast Problem, and on the Other Hand, They Will Do Their Utmost to Persuade President Wang to Stay, So That He Will Return to His Post. In Addition to This, the Central Government Has No Other Options. The Rumor That Zhang's Resignation Was Approved First Is Not Accurate. According to Wang's Entourage, Wang's Entourage Told the Far Eastern News Agency Reporter Yesterday That Mr. Wang Believes That the Resignation of the Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions Is a Common Practice in a Responsible Cabinet System and Has Nothing to Do With Him Personally. Since Mr. Wang Resigned in Anger at Zhang's Non-Resistance, He Has His Own Unavoidable Difficulties and Cannot Abandon His Intention to Resign Simply Because of the Joint Resignation of the Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions. As for Whether the Political Situation Can Make Progress, It Depends on Whether the North China Issue Can Be Dealt With Appropriately.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen's Remarks. At About 5:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon, This Reporter Met With Finance Minister Song Ziwen. According to Song, the Central Government Has Not Yet Replied to the Joint Resignation of the Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions. He Himself Will Not Go to Nanjing for the Time Being or Leave Shanghai for Another Place. Chiang Still Insists on Resolutely Persuading Wang to Stay. As for How the Political Situation Will Develop, All Parties Are Still Exchanging Opinions. The Reporter Asked Whether the Central Government Was Prepared to Elect a New President of the Executive Yuan and Reorganize the National Government Since Wang's Intention to Resign Was Extremely Firm. Song Replied That He Was Not in a Position to Express Any Opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Song Ziwen <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<h3 id="e136">Refutes the Absurd Theory of a Buffer State <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Corrects the Views of the London Times' Tokyo Correspondent. Shanghai, September 9th (Reuters) - The London Times' Tokyo correspondent published a theory that the Three Eastern Provinces should be a buffer state between China and Japan. Today, a Reuters reporter met with Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and Song expressed his astonishment at this theory. He said that the strait between Japan and the Asian continent is many times wider than the strait between England and the European continent. England has not been invaded for thousands of years because of the strait, but Japan believes that it is necessary to annex Korea. Japan's procedures for annexing neighboring countries' land are still in progress. Having forcibly seized the Three Eastern Provinces, it is now said that they are advancing on Rehe Province, the gateway to Peiping. The theory of contiguous land has no limits. An English politician said this long ago. The idea of the Three Eastern Provinces as a buffer state, which is recognized by the London Times' Tokyo correspondent, is astonishing. Even a child knows the puppet nature of the "Manchukuo" independent state. It is truly incomprehensible that some people in England have no feeling and do not know how to stop the Nine-Power Treaty, which solemnly and unconditionally guarantees China's territorial and administrative integrity, from being wantonly violated by major powers, but instead want to find a reason for their own inaction. Song also said that the current serious situation, which was caused by Wang Jingwei's resignation, is not surprising and should not be seen as evidence of China's instability. Japan, the invading country, has even experienced the assassination of two prime ministers, one ambassador to China, and one minister of finance because of the Sino-Japanese issue. It is a natural inevitability that China, in a time of national crisis, will experience emotional outbursts due to differences of opinion on the policies and methods of resisting foreign aggression. He is confident that the current situation can be resolved satisfactorily and that the crystallization of public opinion can be obtained to reject the continued invasion of land with the strength of the entire nation, regardless of the cost. China has been extremely patient under extreme provocation, but the advice of European rulers not to escalate the situation has only resulted in China losing a lot of land without firing a single shot.</p>

<p>Afternoon of the Thirteenth</p>
<p>Various Sectors Should Not Misunderstand, Shanghai Garrison Command Announcement: Announcement Regarding the Following Matter. Previously, Yin Kaisan Requested to Test a Newly Invented Missile. This Headquarters Approved the Test to Be Conducted at Longhua Airport on the Afternoon of the Thirteenth of This Month. There Will Be Explosions in the Air at That Time, Which Will Cause Noise. It Is Requested That All Sectors Do Not Misunderstand. This Announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e138">There Are Still Many Japanese Goods Entering and Exiting <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Secret Smuggling by Unscrupulous Merchants. Since the Activities of the Blood Pledge Corps, the Transport of Japanese Goods to the Yangtze River Has Been Severely Affected. However, Unscrupulous Merchants Are Still Designing in Every Way to Secretly Smuggle Them. The Recent Situation of the Entry and Exit of Inferior Goods Is Recorded Separately Below:</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Piece Goods Shipped Out. Unscrupulous Merchants in Hankou, Changsha, Yichang, and Other Places Are Purchasing Japanese Piece Goods in Large Quantities Because of Their Price Drops. However, Given the Intense Boycott in Shanghai, These Merchants Are Colluding With the Japanese to Avoid Using Chinese Customs Declarations and Instead Have the Japanese Declare the Goods Themselves. It Is Confirmed That the Night Before Last (the Eighth), 3,000 Pieces of Japanese Piece Goods Were Loaded Onto Japanese Riverboats From Lighters by the Japanese. Therefore, Japanese Piece Goods Can Still Be Sold Unimpeded on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Change Packaging and Mail to the Interior. There Are Also Some Unscrupulous Merchants Who Collude With Cotton Weaving Factories to Cut Off the Machine Ends of Inferior Piece Goods and Re-Weave Them With Domestic Brand Names. Because They Cannot Declare the Goods Publicly, They Change the Inferior Goods Into Packages and Mail Them to the Interior. Many Have Already Been Mailed. Jardine Matheson in Chongqing Received a Warning Letter With Bullets Attached. Jardine Matheson Immediately Issued a Statement Saying That the Goods Declared by This Firm Are All Destined for Treaty Ports and That There Are Customs Records That Can Be Examined. This Firm Has Refused to Declare Inferior Goods for Many Years. As for the Talk of Changing the Packaging and Mailing the Goods to Pose as Domestic Goods, That Is Not a Matter for This Firm, and This Firm Has No Right to Interfere. It Should Be Requested That Your Corps Investigate in Detail to Avoid Misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Still Arriving in Shanghai. The Arrival of Japanese Goods Has Not Stopped Due to the Boycott. They Are Still Being Shipped in Constantly, but Most of Them Are Stored in Warehouses at Various Wharves. The Japanese Ship Asama Maru Has Arrived With Many Inferior Goods, Mostly Piece Goods, but the Exact Number Is Unknown. Only Customers Who Pick Up the Goods Are Allowed to View the Hatch Manifest. Loading and Unloading Are Also Stricter Than Usual.</p>

<p>Huang Yuzhou, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, Has Made Great Efforts in Resisting Japan to Save the Nation. Yesterday, He Sent a Letter to a Certain Celebrity in This Port to Report on the Recent Situation of Resistance Against Japan. Excerpts Are as Follows: Yesterday, I Met With Brother Jun Gan and Talked About the Recent Situation of Resistance Against Japan. Excerpts Are as Follows: Yesterday, I Met With Brother Jun Gan and Learned That You Are Exerting Yourself for the Country and Spared No Effort, Which Increases My Respect. I Am Young and Have Little Knowledge, and I Am Experiencing a Time of National Crisis. I Know That I Am Not Competent for the Task. Fortunately, Thanks to the Spirit of the Late Premier in Heaven, Our Work Has Not Been Obstructed. The Situation in Liaodong Has Been Quite Good Recently. Although the Japanese Slaves Are Oppressing in Every Way, the People's Resistance Is Even Stronger. According to Intelligence, Shanchengzhen Has Been Recaptured Recently, and Four Enemy Mountain Guns, 300 Rifles, and More Than 40,000 Rounds of Ammunition Have Been Obtained. The Military Supplies Have Been Slightly Supplemented, and Progress Is Still Being Actively Made. I Was Born in a Late Era and Have Devoted Myself to the Country. I Cannot Bear to Live in Ease. As Long As I Have a Breath Left, I Vow to Fight. Success or Failure, Profit or Loss, Although I Cannot See It in Advance, As a Citizen, How Dare I Shirk My Responsibility? I Know It Is a Matter of Concern, So I Am Reporting It Specifically to Relieve Your Worries.</p>

<p>Recommend That Zhu Wenqi Prepare a Draft Opinion</p>
<p>Submit to the Third Committee Meeting for Review. The Research Committee on the Issue of Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan, Organized by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Convened Its First Meeting at 1:00 PM Yesterday to Continue Discussing the Opinions Expressed by Various Industries on This Issue and to Refer to the Letters From Various County Chambers of Commerce. The Details Are Recorded Below:</p>
<p>Research Committee Meeting. Committee Members Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, Chen Zheqing, Luo Qinghua, Lu Wenshao, and Others Were Present. Zhu Wenqi Chaired the Meeting. First, the Chairman Distributed a Compilation of the Various Questions Received From All Parties Regarding the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan for the Second Time for the Committee Members to Study. After a Long Discussion, It Was Resolved That: (1) After Summarizing the Opinions Put Forward by All Parties in Sequence, a General Abstract Should Be Made According to the Topic for Reference; (2) Regarding All Opinions Resulting From This Association's Research, Committee Member Zhu Wenqi Was Recommended to Prepare a Draft Based on the Main Ideas Proposed by the Sugar Industry and Other Eleven Trade Associations and Submit It to the Next Meeting for Review; (3) The Third Committee Meeting Was Scheduled to Be Convened on August 15th.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong's Remarks. A Reporter From the New Sound News Agency Visited Wang Yansong, a Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Silk Industry Bank, Yesterday to Ask for His Opinion on the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan. According to Him, the Issue of Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan Is About to Move From Research to Implementation. He Was Previously Recommended by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Attend the Research Committee Convened by the Central Bank, but He Was Unable to Accept the Recommendation Due to a Trip to Qingdao. Committee Member Ma Jiliang Attended Instead. As for His Own Position on This Issue, He Believes That the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan Is Indeed a Prerequisite for Unifying the Currency System, but Unifying the Currency System Is Not Something That Can Be Achieved by the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan Alone. After the Abolition of Taels, the Government and Society Must Work Together to Seek the Stability and Improvement of the Financial System, and Only Then Can the Benefits of the Abolition of Taels Be Seen. Although Various Industries Have Different Views on This Issue Now, They Are All in Agreement on Supporting It. Even the Qian Industry Only Advocates Cautious Follow-Up and Does Not Fundamentally Oppose It, Nor Is It for Its Own Selfish Interests. Therefore, the Qian Industry Has Abolished the Increase or Decrease of Two and a Half Hairs, Which Can Also Show Its Selflessness and Impartiality. As for the Exchange Rate Between Taels and Yuan, Which Is Most Common in Commerce, It Should Be a Way for Both Parties to Benefit Equally to Avoid Bias. The Minting of New Coins Must Be in Accordance With the Stipulated Weight and Packaging, and There Should Be No Shortages. A Supervisory Committee Should Be Organized by Various Public Organizations to Supervise and Test Them at Any Time. The Issuance of Exchange Certificates Should Be Publicly Inspected and Made Perfect to Reduce Malpractice. In Short, Everything Will Come Naturally When Conditions Are Ripe. The Public Is Right to Pay Close Attention to This Matter, Which Is Related to the Interests of Society.</p>

When the Exposition Authorities Distributed the Venues the Year Before, President Dawes Personally Designated a 6-Acre Site for China, Which Shows How Much Importance They Attach to China. The Opening Date of the Exposition Is June 1st Next Year. Exhibits From Various Countries Must Arrive in Chicago Before May 15th to Allow Sufficient Time for Arrangement and Display. As for Your Country's Exhibits, I Have a Few Humble Opinions to Offer. Your Country's Exhibits Must Show the Various Steps From the Raw Materials to the Completion of Manufacturing as Much as Possible. Special Attention Should Be Paid to the Strong Oriental Colors of Art, Such as China's Ivory Carvings, Porcelain, Embroidery, Carpets, and Other Exquisitely Crafted Handicrafts Designed and Manufactured in China, Which Are Sure to Be Welcomed by People From All Over the World. When Exhibits Are Sold at the Venue, the Prices Must Be Very Fair. As for Worthless Counterfeit Works, They Are to Be Rejected. In Short, Before the Exhibits Are Shipped Overseas, a Meeting Should Be Held to Plan in Detail the Various Points of Exhibition Reform So That All of China's Exhibits Form a Valuable and Systematic Exhibition. That Would Be Very Fortunate.)</p>

<h3 id="e151">Chaozhou Native Association Urges Not Using Japanese Goods <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chaozhou Sojourners Association's Patriotic National Salvation Corps, for the matter of resisting Japanese goods, yesterday issued an urgent notice stating: "The violent Japanese are invading China, and the government has adopted a policy of non-resistance. The people have no choice but to resist enemy goods to save themselves. The enemy's wealth and power are built on our country as an external treasury. The order of invasion begins with the economy, followed by military force, which is no different from taking our country's money to strengthen their military and kill our people and occupy our land. If we resist and persevere to the end, the enemy's economy will collapse, and their military strength will naturally weaken. The key to the strength, weakness, survival, and demise of the two countries lies here. Since the government was coerced and the resistance was cancelled, unscrupulous merchants and profiteers, blinded by profit and disregarding righteousness, have been buying and selling enemy goods, undermining the public will of the people. The Shanghai Blood Oath Corps' anti-traitorous actions are aimed at maintaining the self-salvation movement and eliminating traitors. Our group held its thirteenth meeting yesterday and also resolved to notify members that they must not buy or sell enemy goods. Those who violate this will be reported by fellow villagers, and if the investigation proves true, they will be expelled from membership and subjected to reputational sanctions. Members will never cooperate with them. All members of our association must, from now on, clearly identify enemy goods, resolutely resist them, not think that one person is irrelevant to the whole, not think that a small item is irrelevant to the overall situation, not think that a moment of</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>compromise is acceptable, and not think that secrecy will keep it from being known. It must be understood that if everyone is negligent, the overall situation will be destroyed, with the great consequence of extermination and national demise, and the small consequence of danger to life, reputation, and honor. Therefore, we solemnly advise you, please pay attention and do not neglect it. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3 id="e152">National Salvation Association's Declaration on the Shu Zhanyuan Case <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association issued a declaration regarding Shu Zhanyuan's case of selling inferior rice, stating: "To all newspaper offices for public consideration by compatriots nationwide: It has now been found that Shu Zhanyuan sold over ten thousand bags of inferior rice. The evidence is solid, and the facts are all present. This treacherous merchant sought personal gain, forgetting the great hatred against us. The bloodstains of the Songhu battle have not yet dried, yet he willingly became a tiger's accomplice, selling inferior goods. He has no conscience and is extremely shameless. Moreover, he deceives all sectors and confuses public opinion, hoping to escape the law. His malicious intentions and despicable behavior are a disgrace to the business community and a public enemy of society. If he is not severely punished, how can we comfort the heroic spirits of our martyrs and appease the public outrage of the people? Previously, the Guangzhou treacherous merchant Peng Chuli transported Japanese goods, hoping for personal gain, and ultimately suffered the death penalty. Now, Shu Zhanyuan sells Japanese goods and should be handed over to the people for judgment and severely punished, so that the punishment of one will deter a hundred, chilling the hearts of treacherous merchants and restraining their greed. This association's duty lies in this, and we dare not remain silent. We hereby declare, asking for public judgment. The Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association bows."</p>

<p>Assistance for the Attack on Rehe</p>
<p>Naval Inspection Tour for Pacification</p>
<p>The commander of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai, Sakonji, originally scheduled to begin his inspection tour of the Yangtze River Japanese warships' defenses on the 11th of this month (today). However, after receiving a telegram from the Kwantung Army on the 7th of this month, deciding to invade Rehe, he immediately convened a joint meeting of naval officers in Shanghai on the evening of the 8th and decided to move the date of the inspection tour forward by one day. Therefore, Sakonji departed on the flagship Izumo at 4:30 PM yesterday to Wuhan, carrying an additional 500 special marines to supplement the shortage of Japanese naval forces along the Yangtze River. His intentions are difficult to fathom. However, according to information obtained by a Shih Wen News Agency reporter, Sakonji summoned Marine Corps Commander Sugisaka and others at the naval headquarters on Jiangwan Road at around 10:00 AM yesterday for a farewell address. In addition to temporarily transferring his duties as naval commander to Sugisaka, he also gave important instructions to his subordinates. The gist of it was: "The important principle of my inspection tour of the Yangtze River defenses this time is to pacify naval officers and soldiers in various places and arouse their patriotic conscience. Because our army (Sakonji's self-designation) in the Northeast has decided to attack Rehe and eliminate the volunteer army on the Chinese side. Although Shanghai is far from Rehe, we must also actively provide sympathy and assistance to the army in the Northeast. My inspection tour will last for about one month. Please take care of Shanghai affairs temporarily, Mr. Sugisaka. After my departure,</p>
<p>you must work harder on protecting our expatriates."</p>

<p>The Yili special steamer will set sail on the 18th. Sanmen Bay in eastern Zhejiang is a good port in our country's southeast. Since the government specially approved Shanghai merchant Xu Tingzu to handle port affairs, the Chinese people have been spreading the news, causing a great stir. According to the person in charge of the Sanmen Bay Port Development Office, the Port Development Office has now been reorganized into a joint-stock limited partnership, initiated by Xu Tingzu and Deng Zhenquan, who are also unlimited liability partners responsible for attracting investment. All organizational charters and port development plans have been submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry for approval. The company is currently actively underway. Xu and Deng have scheduled a tea party at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hall on the 12th of this month to report on the reorganization process and the port development policy and have scheduled the 18th of this month to sail the Yili fast steamer exclusively to Sanmen Bay to welcome people from all walks of life to conduct on-site inspections of Sanmen Bay. The ship will stay in Sanmen Bay for two days for inspection and then proceed to Mount Putuo, allowing the inspectors to take the opportunity to visit the scenic spots and increase the interest of the trip. The ship is equipped with clean Chinese and Western meals and has Chinese and Western doctors on board, with extremely complete equipment. It is said that after the company's invitation tickets were issued, the number of participants from all walks of life was quite enthusiastic, which is enough to show the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for construction undertakings, and the</p>
<p>company's aspirations are aimed at the welfare of the people. The future development is immeasurable, and its relationship to the promotion of our country's industry and the development of social economy is particularly beneficial.</p>

<p>The Tianjin Postal Affairs Club Telegraphed for Rescue The National Postal Workers Union reported yesterday that Zhang Baoheng, the postmaster of Shahe Town Post Office in the Liaoning District, and several mail carriers from Xi'an were arrested by the police of the Puppet State's Eleventh Branch at the Shenyang Shenhai Terminal Inn. After receiving the report, the union forwarded it to the Director-General of Posts for rescue. The original report of the Liaoning Club is recorded below: "Regarding the report, we recently received a report from Mu Shaozhou, a mail carrier from the Xi'an Bureau, that Zhang Baoheng, the postmaster of Shahe Town Bureau, and mail carriers from Xi'an arrived at the Shenyang Shenhai Terminal at 9:00 PM on the 26th of last month on their way to Tianjin and stayed at the Tiande Inn.

<h3 id="e162">Report from Liaoning District Postal Workers Entering the Pass <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Circumstances Before and After the Blockade</p>
<p>Ba Lidi Shed Blood for the Public Good</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Surnames of Traitors The Northeast Postal Service, after the Ministry of Communications ordered the blockade, the Postal Directorate-General has received reports on the handling of the closure in various postal districts, but has not yet released them for the sake of prudence. The postal workers in the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang districts, as a result of negotiations with the local postal directors, were all promised to be issued passports. At the same time, members of the Liaoning District Postal Affairs Club also arrived in Tianjin one after another and established an office in Tianjin to take care of the resettlement of postal workers entering the pass. The office also made a detailed report to the National Postal Workers Union on the process of the Shenyang Bureau's transfer and the total number of postal workers entering the pass until now, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Liaoning Postal District received the order to blockade on July 24. Postal Director Ba Lidi printed and issued a bureau notice and announcement that evening (3 o'clock in the afternoon), announcing the blockade and ordering the completion of mail sealing and delivery that evening. All employees were to leave the post office, leaving only two gatekeepers to guard. All doors were sealed, and all personnel were issued one month's salary (July salary) and travel expenses (calculated at half of August salary) from the 23rd and ordered to report to the four locations of Pingjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao respectively. However, the blockade order was issued very urgently at the time, and employees who were unable to receive their salaries were to receive them at the postal director's residence after the 24th. As soon as the Puppet State heard the news, it ordered police detectives to</p>
<p>guard the post office and the homes of all employees. The alert employees left for the pass on the evening of the 24th without any danger. Those who did not leave after the 25th were unable to do so because their homes were surrounded by police detectives, and the police officers strictly ordered the landlords and neighbors to monitor them and prevent them from escaping. For a time, many were detained and dared not move rashly. Even under these circumstances, personnel planned to enter the pass by traveling day and night. Some detoured through Andong and Yingkou, while others entered the pass through the Shenyu section of the Beining Road. It is estimated that there are now six or seven postal workers, sixty-nine postal assistants, and five hundred and thirty laborers in Tianjin, totaling six hundred and sixty-six people. In addition to those who have arrived and are successively reporting to the Tianjin Bureau and temporarily assigned to work in the management bureau and branches, people continue to arrive every day. The inns around Tianjin East Station are already overcrowded, but a small number of people</p>
<p>sell themselves to the Puppet State, hoping to become</p>
<p>officials of a fallen country. It is impossible to blame these few cold-blooded people, as human beings are not all the same. The urgent task at hand is to resettle the employees entering the pass, especially the lower-level laborers, whose salaries are too low. They risked their lives to come, and their aspirations are commendable. They should be given relief and protection. These laborers escaped alone, and their clothes and luggage are mostly missing, which is very pitiful. The headquarters is responsible for planning the welfare and relief of colleagues and cannot shirk this responsibility. Therefore, Jin Shaochu was assigned to take charge of the reception in Tianjin in advance, and Pingfang was in charge of the reception by Zheng Tingjie, with the support of friendly associations in various places. Now, the</p>
<p>aftermath of the personnel entering the pass is complicated, and efforts are needed in all aspects. An emergency meeting of the Standing Committee has been convened to decide to set up offices in Pingjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao. Zheng Tingjie, Song Baixiang, and Zhang Siwen will be in charge of Beiping; Jin Shaotian, Wang Weisi (currently in Yuguan), Jiang Fengshan, Jin Zhiming, Jin Zelun, and Li Wenqi will be in charge of organizing the offices in Tianjin. Efforts have been made to contact colleagues in Qingdao, and it is planned to have Li Xiong, Xiao Guohua, and He Hongtao organize offices in Shanghai to implement the Liaoning Postal Affairs</p>
<p>Colleagues Club office. All matters related to the welfare of colleagues, according to this blockade, were very urgent. Although employees were subjected to Japanese surveillance, Postal Director</p>
<p>Ba Lidi, under duress and high pressure, organized the bureau's affairs, maintained the employees, and worked day and night, even injecting stimulants to maintain his energy. His responsible spirit is worthy of respect by the Chinese people. Deputy Postal Director Liu Yaoting, under the siege of the Japanese, was coerced and enticed but did not move. Since October, he has assisted the postal director in handling everything, sharing hardships and dangers. His contribution is also indispensable. The colleagues of the headquarters should inform the workers of the whole country of the hardships of the responsible officials and comfort them upon their return.</p>
<p>Traitors According to recent investigations, there is a translator,</p>
<p>a native of Guangdong Province, named Weng Jian, who serves as an inspector at the Shenyang Puppet Bureau with a monthly salary of 180 yuan. The dismissed postal workers Wang Xijin and Lu Shuyou have all served in the Puppet Bureau. In addition, postal worker Wang Wenxiang has sold himself as a traitor and serves as the director of the business office. The rest have not yet been investigated and will be reported after investigation. In addition, the personnel restriction guarantee has been cancelled, and the truth is currently under investigation. Sincerely submitted to the National Postal Workers Union, Ning Postal Affairs Colleagues Club Executive Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Municipal Health Bureau Notifies Citizens <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Implementing Disinfection of Well Water and Creek Water, Do Not Misunderstand This summer, the weather is extremely hot, and cholera has occurred in the city, with a very fierce momentum. The Municipal Health Bureau, based on the experience gained from years of cholera prevention investigations, has found that this disease in this city initially occurs mostly in residents in areas where tap water has not yet arrived and rely solely on drinking well water and creek water. In order to thoroughly eliminate the cholera hazard, the bureau has specially organized 12 disinfection teams this year, all wearing uniforms and distributing disinfection medicines, and assigning them to various parts of the city to carry out well water and flood water disinfection work. Since its implementation, considerable results have been achieved. However, during the work, citizens still do not understand the truth, are suspicious and panic, and misunderstandings have occurred. It is now heard that the bureau has specially notified citizens to explain the importance of well water and creek water disinfection, that the disinfection medicines used are harmless, and that there is no harm to citizens. It is hoped that citizens will not misunderstand. The bureau's announcement and leaflet to citizens are recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcement The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau announces: False announcement matters, this year, cholera has occurred in the city, and its momentum is very strong. This disease is mostly caused by drinking unclean well water or creek water. In order to prevent it, the bureau has recently dispatched staff wearing uniforms, carrying disinfection medicines, to disinfect all well water and creek water in the city. The disinfection medicines used are harmless and do not harm the health of citizens. This work of the bureau is entirely for the purpose of protecting public health and eliminating the harm to citizens.</p>
<p>All are to be fully informed, do not be suspicious, do not panic, and do not misunderstand.</p>
<p>Do not add obstruction is necessary, carefully announce this.</p>
<p>Leaflet Citizens This summer, cholera</p>
<p>epidemics have occurred in the city, and the momentum is very fierce. I believe everyone has heard about it. This disease is mostly transmitted by unclean drinks, so the first places where it occurs are always in places where there is no tap water. Because residents in places where there is no tap water all drink unclean well water and dirty creek water, they are most likely to contract this epidemic. In order to eliminate this germ and avoid harm to citizens, the bureau has recently dispatched staff wearing uniforms, carrying disinfection medicines, to disinfect all well water and creek water. The disinfection medicines used are harmless and do not harm the health of citizens. This work of the bureau is entirely for the purpose of eliminating harm to citizens and seeking peace. We hope that everyone will not be suspicious or fearful, so as to cause misunderstandings and add obstruction. If there is any obstruction, hindering the performance of official duties, the bureau will handle it according to law and will never forgive it. Everyone must pay attention and persuade each other to take care of it. This is of utmost importance. Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau initiates,</p>
<h3 id="e165">Harbor Quarantine Office Cholera Report <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Eleventh Period Harbor Quarantine Office Director and Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office Director Wu Liande yesterday (10th) issued the eleventh cholera weekly report as follows: (1) Since the cholera epidemic in Shanghai this year, it has been the fifteenth week. The past weekend (ending August 6), there were 454 new cholera cases, a decrease of 50 cases from the previous week. A list is shown below:</p>
<p>Number of Cases Deaths</p>
<p>Shanghai City 147 9 Public Concession 257 including 6 foreigners 23 including 2 foreigners French Concession 50 including 5 foreigners 7 including 1 foreigner Total 454 including 11 foreigners 39 including 3 foreigners Previous Total 2570 including 42 foreigners 175 including 12 foreigners</p>
<p>Grand Total 3024 including 53 foreigners 214 including 15 foreigners In view of the above, the mortality rate of cholera in Shanghai to date is 7%. (2) It has been found that the cholera epidemic in Guangzhou, Shantou, and other South China ports seems to have been alleviated. Recently, a report from Guangzhou stated that only 12 cases were seen in ten weeks, a large decrease compared to the 203 cases reported in the first week of July. Now the epidemic has spread to Dalian, Niuzhuang, Harbin, and Yantai, but the discovery is</p>
<p>late, and the climate is cool, so it should not be too rampant. (3) It has been found that ships coming to and from Shanghai port still have cholera cases. The details are as follows: (A) The Canadian Empress ship arrived in Kobe on August 8 and found that the ship's cook had died of cholera. The ship was quarantined for five days. (B) The Changsha ship</p>
<p>found a tea room attendant with cholera while being repaired in Shanghai Shipyard on August 3. The patient was immediately sent to the epidemic hospital, and 94 crew members were given prevention injections. The entire ship was disinfected. (C) The Japanese Deng ship Nagasaki Maru left Shanghai on August 4. Due to suspected cholera patients being found on board, the ship was ordered to stay in the port for 14 hours when it arrived in Nagasaki the next day before being allowed to proceed to Kobe. (4) The Ministry of Interior's Health Department announced that this year's cholera epidemic has spread to almost the entire country, with epidemics reaching 15 provinces, including coastal ports, involving 120 counties. It can be said to be extremely rampant. Fortunately, peacetime defenses were properly implemented, and many prevention injection vaccines were prepared, so it was not too difficult to handle. (5) It has been found that this year's cholera prevention relies on the cooperation of all sectors, and the effectiveness is not small, especially the effectiveness of prevention injections. The number of injections is currently being statistically analyzed, because some citizens voluntarily invited doctors or went directly to the hospital to request injections, and some voluntarily paid high consultation fees to seek prevention injections. It can be seen that the public has a considerable understanding of injections. Some people may ask what is the effectiveness of using oral medicines to prevent cholera. It is undoubtedly more effective to use oral prevention medicines to prevent typhoid fever, but there is no significant record for preventing cholera. As for the method of subcutaneous injection prevention, according to experience, it is indeed effective in preventing infection. According to the experience gained, two injections are given every other week, and the immune effect can last for six months. However, the vaccine made in this country is more effective than the imported one, because the germicidal effect of the imported vaccine is weakened for people in this country. But regardless of whether or not injections are given, it is most important to avoid eating raw and cold foods and using unclean water. (6) Now, one case of someone who received one injection and still contracted cholera is briefly described as follows: Zhang, a rat catcher at this office, 34 years old, recently contracted mild cholera (confirmed by bacterial test). He was sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road on August 4 and was cured after receiving salt water injection treatment. It was found that this person had only received one injection three months ago.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Reorganization Completed Under Orders <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Ten District Offices Established Yesterday</p>
<p>and Actively Preparing to Establish the Fisheries Bank of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau, since it was ordered to reorganize last month and changed its name, the director of the bureau, Fan Zhilong, in order to develop fisheries and expand police force, specially purchased patrol ships and supplemented the number of police officers. The bureau was also officially established a few days ago. At the same time, the branch offices were also established yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Expanding the Original Police Force The bureau was ordered to reorganize by the Executive Yuan, and after being passed by the Legislative Yuan, it immediately followed the new organizational law to carry out reorganization, and was renamed (Jiangsu-Zhejiang District Marine Fisheries Administration Bureau). In view of the recent rampant piracy, the bureau's police force was weak, so in addition to the original four patrol ships, it also converted the Jinghai and Xinglong merchant ships into patrol ships a few days ago. In addition, a number of small steamships were purchased) for patrol use. The original fishing protection team was expanded into a large team, divided into five detachments, stationed in various parts of Nantong, to protect fishermen, and a large number of military supplies were purchased, so the police force after the reorganization was quite strong.</p>
<p>Establishing Branch Offices The bureau should establish branch offices in various coastal areas in accordance with the organizational law in order to protect the fishermen nearby. Now Director Fan has stipulated that the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are divided into ten districts, including three in Jiangsu: Songhu, Tongzhou, and Haizhou; and seven in Zhejiang: Haining, Dinghai, Zhenhai, Wenzhou, Zhapu, Xiangshan, and Taizhou. The candidates for the directors of each district have been appointed by Fan and filed with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Currently, the personnel have gone to their respective posts.</p>
<p>Names of District Directors The names of the directors of each district are recorded as follows: Haining Hua Zhiheng, Dinghai Tao Mengzhao, Zhenhai Xu Zhenxu, Wenzhou Hang Shiwei, Zhapu Tong Zhiyi, Xiangshan Chen Zheng, Taizhou Liang Zhaohong, Songhu An Qi, Tongzhou Liang Qixian, Haizhou Zhu Shiqing,</p>
<p>Collecting Special Fishing Protection Fees After the establishment of the branch offices, special protection fees will be collected in accordance with the organizational law. The method is that in addition to (the bureau being responsible for protecting fishing boats as usual), if fishermen request the bureau to specially dispatch fishing protection teams or patrol ships for protection, the requested fishing boats will be charged a special protection fee according to the size of the boat and the distance of the route. However, the number is more during the spring and autumn fishing seasons each year, and very few at ordinary times.</p>
<p>Organizing a Fisheries Bank In order to develop the future of the marine industry, the bureau has specially planned to set up a fisheries bank. According to Secretary Sun of the bureau speaking to the Huadong News Agency reporter, the bank plans to have a share capital of 5 million yuan, and is of a limited nature. In order to popularize the share capital, all fishing firms will be shareholders, and the bureau will also add official shares depending on the economic strength, so that it can proceed. All plans have been formulated and will be carried out soon.</p>

<p>A suicide note says he went to the Western Paradise</p>
<p>No abnormalities were seen when he came to Shanghai from Yangzhou</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, he was reported missing again</p>
<p>The family is anxiously waiting to die Since the popularity of martial arts novels, many minors have been confused by them. Recently, Zhang Zhaishou of Shengping Lane, Taifu Street, Yangzhou, has a son named Zhang Zhishun, who is only thirteen years old. He is usually obsessed with martial arts novels. On the morning of the twelfth of last month, he went to school from home and never returned. The family did not see him return home for lunch and was very surprised. They went to the school to inquire, but he did not go to school. They searched everywhere, but there was no trace. Later, a note was found on the desk at home, which read (I went to the Western Paradise with the holy monk, don't miss me). The handwriting was indeed Zhishun's own. Knowing that he had traveled far, the whole family was worried and didn't know what to do. His parents were especially anxious and wanted to die. After leaving home, Zhishun came to Shanghai alone on the thirteenth and turned to his uncle and sister, claiming that he came with his classmates. When asked about the names and addresses of his classmates, he was evasive, and he did not bring any change of clothes. His uncle and sister were very surprised, but because his mother had said in Shanghai last year that Zhishun wanted to come but did not succeed, now seeing him come alone, they thought it was a fulfillment of his long-cherished wish, and at most they only suspected that the child was greedy and playful and came to Shanghai privately. After he came, his goal had been achieved, and there would be no more accidents. The next day, they sent a letter to Yangzhou to inquire, but before the reply came, Zhishun disappeared again. Before that, after Zhishun came to Shanghai, he was very happy with his younger brother, sister, and nephews, and became friends with children of similar ages in the same neighborhood at first sight. All day long, besides playing with his companions or telling stories, he never put down the books in his hands. When he read what books, they were all martial arts swordsmen, such as those for several days, without any abnormalities. Unexpectedly, after lunch on the 20th, he suddenly disappeared. At first, he thought he was playing with his companions at the home of a neighbor in the same neighborhood. By 4:00 PM, he was looking for snacks but could not find him. He asked the children of the families he played with, and they all said they had not seen him. Only then did he realize that something was wrong. He checked the boxes and found that 10 yuan in banknotes and 1.2 yuan in savings left over from his arrival were missing. He immediately sent someone to the west to search and went to the station to look for him, but there was no trace. One day after he ran away from his Shanghai residence, he received a letter from his family explaining the past situation and firmly urging him not to let him go. How could he know that the letter had not arrived and the person had left? But he still hoped that the one who went out suddenly would drift back. He sent a letter to Yangzhou to inquire, and then received a letter saying that he had not returned. Until now, this poor child is still the target of daily anticipation of his relatives in Shanghai and Yangzhou, and he has no money left. Where has he been relying on for more than ten days? It is really puzzling. If any charitable organizations, monasteries, and people from all walks of life know of his whereabouts and report them to his family, it would be a great merit.

<p>Alas, Poverty, the Eldest Son Commits Suicide</p>
<p>The Landlord Forces Relocation, and She Hangs Herself in the Middle of the Night Mrs. Lu Xi, 51 years old, hanged herself at home at 3:00 AM yesterday due to economic pressure. The police have been notified for inspection and burial. The tragic history of her family is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Family History of the Deceased Lu Xi, from Changshu, lived at No. 12, Huayuan Stone Bridge, Pudong. Her husband died more than 20 years ago, leaving behind one son (named Mingzhong) and two daughters, who were still in swaddling clothes. The pillar of Xi's family was suddenly broken, and her livelihood was cut off. She hurriedly coffined and buried her husband, and worked hard to try to maintain for several years. The difficulties during this period need not be said. Later, relatives and friends saw her and pitied her, so they introduced a fellow villager named Xiangbao to fill the room as her husband. Xi's mother and son and three others were able to have someone to take care of them and would not be reduced to starving to death. This was more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>The Suicide of the Eldest Son Later, Mingzhong grew up and was introduced to work as a driver at the Nanyang Printing House on Tao Peng Road in Hudong. He also married and had children. In the year before last (19th year), Mingzhong was 25 years old. His stepfather was old and unable to produce, so the five members of the family depended on Mingzhong alone to make a living. Mingzhong had limited income and huge household expenses. He also borrowed more than 100 yuan from the landlord Gu Longlong, which he could not repay. He committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills at 10:00 PM on May 16 of this year. When his family found out, he had already died of poisoning and could not be saved. His situation was reported in various newspapers the next day. Later, two suicide notes were found in his bedroom, one to his mother and one to his cousin. Reading his letter to his mother, every word was a tear, and he couldn't bear to finish reading it. Excerpts from a few words are quoted below, (The man has been living in the city of sorrow every day in the past two weeks. He is so poor now, his debts are piling up, his clothes are all gone, he has no way to borrow money, he can't eat enough, he can't wear warm clothes, and the family expenses are very large. The wages earned by the man are not enough for household use. This is entirely the man's fault. He has not repaid the kindness of raising him, and he often sees adults shedding tears. The man's heart aches so much. The father's coffin has been in Chang for more than 20 years and has not been buried. This is also the man's fault. The man has grown up to 25 years old and cannot support the adults and the whole family. He is really ashamed and standing in the world, so he has to take this dead end. Your daughter-in-law is very young. Nowadays, few women observe chastity. If he is righteous, he will live a good life with his family. If he is not righteous, let her be. Only the granddaughter must not be taken away by others. Please ask the adults to take her to the infant hall.)</p>
<p>Hanging Herself Due to Relocation After Mingzhong's death, Xi's eldest daughter went to the Nanyang Cigarette Factory to pick out tobacco silk, and the second daughter went to the Tianzhang Paper Factory to pick out old cloth. She earned a few corners of silver every day to maintain the family's livelihood, but she was often insufficient. She accumulated more than one year's rent (three and a half yuan per month). During the year, she only paid 37 yuan of rent. The landlord urged her to pay urgently. If she could not cope, she would have to move out. Xi found a flat house in Gu Sanshan, paid a deposit of three yuan, and declared to the old landlord Gu Longlong that she would move out by the tenth of this month (ie, yesterday). Gu Sanshan suddenly returned the deposit, so the lease was not completed. By 3:00 AM yesterday, Xi was forced to hang herself because the deadline for relocation had arrived and she saw that there was nowhere to move. At that time, her family was still asleep. When they found out at dawn, she had already died and her body was cold. Xi's stepfather Xiangbao accused the landlord Gu Longlong of forcing her to death to the Third District. The district ordered Gu to be summoned to the case for questioning, and then he was temporarily released on bail.</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements The Third District Public Security Bureau issued a notice to the local security officer Xie Along yesterday morning, requesting the local court to send someone to examine the body. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Yang and Inspector Shen arrived at the scene for examination. It was found that Xi had committed suicide by hanging. He ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial first, while the corpse's daughter-in-law Hu and the corpse's daughters knelt in front of the coffin and shouted for injustice. The official ordered them to file a lawsuit according to the law. It is reported that the Pudong Fifth District Cigarette, Loading and Unloading, Paper Making, Cotton Weaving, and Japan-China Branch Offices and other groups have raised funds because the coffin and burial expenses of the deceased were not available, and have jointly submitted a public request to the party and government agencies for assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Case of the Brutal Murder of a Mistress <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Pu Henian Talks Eloquently</p>
<p>Narrates the Process of the Murder Without Reservation Pu Henian (23 years old), a native of Qingpu, lived in the back building of the Yun Ji Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 825, Dongxi Huade Road. At noon the day before yesterday, he killed his mistress Wang Xiuying with a kitchen knife due to jealousy and hatred. The Huishan Patrol Room received a report and sent detectives to arrest the murderer Pu Henian. The deceased was carried into the morgue. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the patrol room, stated the case and presented the murder weapon and a photo of the deceased and the defendant together for inspection. He continued that the blood stains on the knife were obvious, and there was a strand of hair stuck to it, which was unbearable to see. When questioned, the defendant Pu Henian confessed that he used to be in the cotton business and is now selling Rendan. The deceased Wang Xiuying was 25 years old and from Suzhou. On March 24 of this year, I took a boat to Shanghai from Suzhou. I met her on the boat and talked to each other. She asked me where I was going. I replied that I was going to Shanghai to do a small business. She said that she was also going to Shanghai to visit relatives, so we were intimate with each other. After arriving in Shanghai, we went to the Kaiji Sheng Inn on Fuzhou Road for one night. The next day, we went to the Donghai Hotel on Houma Road and stayed for more than two months. Because the expenses were not enough, we moved to a kitchen shed rented in Shangyi Lane, Baxianqiao, in the French Concession. We lived there for a month. This was known to my fiancee Shunbao from my hometown, who came to make trouble. Wang Xiuying told me to abandon her, so I avoided her and stayed at the Yingbin Hotel for two nights. My wife could not return home and was afraid of causing trouble again, so we moved to the back building of No. 825, Dongxi Huade Road. Recently, due to economic difficulties, I sold Rendan on various roads, earning a few corners every day, but it was still not enough for expenses, and Wang Xiuying often went out and behaved irregularly. Four days ago, she did not return one night. The next day, when I asked her, she claimed to be staying with her little sisters. Unexpectedly, the night before last, she did not return again until 11:00 the next day. When I asked her slightly, I was greatly scolded, saying that I should make a voucher to sever all ties forever. If I don't measure my strength, I will give you some color, and said that I would cut it in half with one knife and find my own way. When I heard this, I was so angry that I couldn't restrain myself. I recalled that I was a young man, and I regretted being blind and being deceived by her. Now that the money is gone, she wants me to break up. Although I was fooled, I have already made a mistake, and it is too late to regret. Therefore, I could not vent my anger. I took a kitchen knife from behind the door and killed her, and did not try to escape. I planned to call the patrol, but the second landlord Liu Cao Shi arrived and twisted me up. Liu Cao Shi testified that the defendant moved in for only more than 20 days. At that time, he claimed to be a teacher in a school, and there were only two of them, husband and wife. They were usually harmonious, and no relatives or friends came. A few days ago, Wang Xiuying did not return one night, and it was not heard that there was any conflict with the defendant. The night before last, she did not go home again until noon the next day. Then I heard a quarrel. I ordered the apprentice to inquire, and he replied that nothing happened. Suddenly, I heard a cry for help, so I went upstairs to persuade her. I saw that the door was closed. Peeking through the cracks, Wang Xiuying was covered in blood and rolling around on the ground. I was so shocked that I ran downstairs and called the police. The defendant was already walking down the escalator and was twisted and handed over to the police for detention. Feng Yonglin, who lived on the front building of the house, testified that he went out to see a doctor because he was sick. When he came back, he saw the back building calling for help and knocked on the door but it did not open. After a while, the second landlord and the police arrived and arrested the defendant. After Shen Bingrong, the judge, verified the confession, he said that the facts of the case were very clear and ordered the defendant to be sent to the morgue for questioning. At 11:00, Zhan Liangce, the prosecutor appointed by the Special Court, arrived at the office and verified that the woman Wang Xiuying had been stabbed to death with a sharp weapon while she was alive. The murderer Pu Henian was taken into custody for investigation, and the corpse was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffining and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Continued Report on the Nightingale Case <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Bathroom Inn Tea Server Appears in Court to Testify</p>
<p>Fan Hongsheng Suffered from a Nervous Disorder</p>
<p>Once Hospitalized, He Bit Through Iron Chains and Escaped</p>
<p>This case is adjourned for one week for further hearing. Nanjing native Fan Hongsheng (i.e., Fan Ruibao) went to the residence of female fortune teller Wang Wenyin at No. 89 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, at 3:05 PM on July 19 of this year, fatally stabbed Wang, and Wang's mother, Wu, was also injured in the attack. Fan fled the scene and disappeared without a trace. Subsequently, after a thorough investigation by Chinese Detective Yu A'gen, Su Changsheng, Detective Zhou Guisheng, Zhao Ziren of the Old Gate Police Station, it was discovered that Fan was hiding at his sister's residence at No. 965 Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, and he was arrested. Jun'ao Ke Cheng Meixian, Wang Wenyin's teacher, was also suspected of involvement and arrested. After investigation, it was found that Cheng was not involved, and the court was requested to order his release on bail. Fan was then sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Fan's lawyer, Jiang Baoli, argued that Fan suffered from a mental disorder and should be exempt from criminal punishment according to the law, requesting an adjournment to present evidence proving his condition. The court granted the request and announced a postponement. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the hearing resumed. Presiding Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court resumed the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the court had previously ordered investigations into the Longquan Bathhouse and the Yadong Hotel, which had now been completed, as reported by the detectives. Detective Su then testified, "I went to Longquan for investigation. They replied that the defendant had been to the bathhouse between 1:00 and 2:00 PM on the day of the incident and left shortly after." Detective Zhou then testified, "My investigation confirmed that the defendant and Wenyin lived together in a room at the Yadong Hotel." He then submitted the registration book as evidence. Lin A'er, a tea server at the Yadong Hotel, testified that Fan Hongsheng and Wenyin came to rent Room 11 in May, stayed for two days, and then came again in early June for three days. Li Hongsheng, a tea server at the Longquan Bathhouse, also testified, stating that Fan came on July 19 before 1:00 PM, stayed for about fifteen minutes, and then left. He also stated that Fan came to bathe from time to time, and whenever he saw people talking, he would suspect they were scolding him, indiscriminately scolding anyone, whether familiar or not. Even I was sometimes subjected to his insults and scolding. I knew he had a mental illness, so I didn't argue with him." At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Jiang Baoli, stated, "Now I have two pieces of physical evidence and three witnesses, all of which are sufficient to prove that the defendant does indeed have a mental illness. The physical evidence consists of reply letters from Xin Puyu Hall and Suzhou Gospel Hospital to our law firm. The witnesses are the defendant's landlord, his mother, and his brother." According to the letter from Xin Puyu Hall, on August 7 of last year, while the defendant was being treated for madness at the hall, he bit through extremely strong iron chains and escaped by jumping off the roof. This happened twice. The letter from Gospel Hospital stated that the defendant was discharged on January 6 and would have needed to stay for another year to fully recover, which proves that his illness was not cured. This is clear evidence." He then submitted the two letters as evidence and stated, "After the January 28th Incident, the defendant gave everyone who worked with him at the former Railway Bureau business cards with titles such as 'Communist Party Member, Shanghai'... but all of them were unable to come to court to testify due to their positions. Moreover, his old illness relapsed again around May 27. All of this is sufficient to prove the defendant's mental incapacity beyond any doubt." The witness Luo Linmei, a woman of 23 years of age from Shaoxing, residing at No. 1329 Wenjian Shi Road, testified, "The defendant's sister lives with me, and Fan often comes to my sister's house. When Fan goes crazy, he throws things on the ground and yells at people. Sometimes he even catches flies and eats them. When my family lit incense on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, he burned his hand with the candle and sat on top of the car instead of inside it. Therefore, the residents of Wenjian Shi Road all regard him as a madman. He seemed to have recovered slightly after leaving the hospital this year, but unexpectedly, his old illness relapsed around May 20-something. My mother couldn't stand the fright, so she told Fan's sister to move out, which they did in early June. I don't know what happened after that." Fan's brother, Fan Hongbin, who works at the Railway Bureau as the station master of Nanjing Station, testified, "Hong Sheng's madness was entirely due to the excessive stimulation he suffered from the divorce lawsuit with his wife, Xiuying. Hong Sheng told me that Xiuying (who was also in court listening, wearing a red floral qipao and a corsage, her face covered in rouge) had been unfaithful even before they married, but he still cared for her very much. However, Xiuying suddenly returned to Ning that year, which led to the lawsuit. As a result, Hong Sheng and Xiuying had two fights, which were taken to the police station and the police department. On July 6 of this year, Hong Sheng came to Nanjing and asked me for fifteen yuan for injections. He also said to me, 'You sent me to the hospital, and the doctor injected me with syphilis. You must be careful, I will kill you and your wife.' I gave him three yuan and sent someone to escort him to Shanghai, and explained the situation at Xin Puyu Hall, etc." Fan's mother, Li, also testified that Fan Hongsheng recently tried to cut out his heart with a knife and grabbed her hand, pulling her to dance. When questioned, Fan Hongsheng denied having a mental disorder. Lawyer Jiang then stated that people with mental illness never admit it and deeply resent others saying they are sick. Police Lawyer Ru, because the cause of the defendant's crime in this case is still difficult to prove, requested the court to postpone the hearing for another week for investigation. The court granted the request and adjourned.</p>

<p>The Pudong Native Place Association, feeling that compatriots in the south cannot but help the Northeastern Volunteer Army, who are fighting fiercely against the violent Japanese, decided to hold a dinner at the Weihaiwei Chinese Association at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month. The announcement stated: "Respectfully, as the Xiongnu are not yet destroyed, Bu Shi contributes his wealth; as the Zhou Dynasty is about to fall, widowed women abandon their weaving. Our association previously issued a fundraising notice for the Northeastern Volunteer Army, originally intending to show common hatred and unite to save the country. However, more than a month has passed, and the response has been minimal. In this month, the strong bandits have invaded more and more urgently, and the volunteer army has fought hard, falling and rising repeatedly. Observing the dangerousness of the situation, we know more clearly that the contribution of resources cannot be delayed. Therefore, we have decided to gather our colleagues to discuss ways to provide relief. We sincerely hope for your presence, and we pray for peace."</p>

<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shanxi, Gansu, Rehe, Chahar, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Xinjiang Provincial Federations of Commerce, stating: "It is found that as of now, there are still thirteen provinces, including your federation, that have not been reorganized according to law. Our federation has previously telegraphed repeatedly to urge you, but you have not been able to complete it within the time limit. Moreover, Article 37, paragraph 2 of the Commercial Association Law stipulates that the establishment of the Commercial Association of the Republic of China shall require more than one-fourth of the provincial commercial associations and special municipal commercial associations as initiators and the consent of more than two-thirds of the provincial commercial associations and special municipal commercial associations to formulate articles of association and submit them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (now the Ministry of Industry) for approval and report to the National Government for record. Currently, all the provincial commercial associations and special municipal commercial associations that have been reorganized according to law do not meet the legal number, so our federation has not been able to reorganize according to law. Therefore, your federation's failure to reorganize is hindering our federation's progress. Accordingly, we are telegraphing again for your federation to investigate and immediately urge all commercial associations to reorganize and schedule a reorganization of the provincial federation of commerce. Please report the progress to the federation at any time. Sincerely hope. Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Lin Kanghou."</p>
<h3 id="e191">Recent News on the San You Labor-Management Dispute <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District of Shanghai has prepared a document to submit to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau regarding the San You Factory dispute, reporting that the management is deliberately making things difficult and reducing food expenses, leading to agitation among the public, which is impossible to stop. The shutdown since the January 28th Shanghai War has not yet been resolved. The affiliated associations have repeatedly submitted reports to the municipal government and your bureau regarding the situation. The municipal government issued Directive No. 142, ordering the management to be responsible for providing food for the workers before the case is resolved according to law. However, the management still wants to resist stubbornly. Fortunately, your bureau strictly ordered the management to provide a daily food allowance of 120 yuan to temporarily maintain two meals a day and barely make a living. The management not only does not show compassion but also relapses into its old habits, stubbornly going its own way, arbitrarily making things difficult, and recently reducing the food allowance to 100 yuan per day. How can this meager amount maintain the lives of more than a thousand people (according to the most recent re-registration)? The people are indignant and cannot express it. The responsible personnel of the affiliated associations are unable to maintain the situation under these circumstances. Therefore, a special document is submitted to request prompt and proper measures to calm the public's anger. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Social Bureau, Shanghai Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District.</p>

<p>Unprecedented achievement by Singaporean Overseas Chinese. The Overseas Chinese Cup, donated by Mr. Ge Leilie, former captain of the Chinese team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps, specifically for the shooting competition between Chinese merchant corps in various ports in the Far East, was again used for this year's remote competition between Shanghai and Singapore last month. The shooting results of the Shanghai team have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now reported that the Singapore competition was held on the 24th of last month.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The list of results was sent to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The total score was 850 points, exceeding Shanghai's 808 points by 42 points, breaking the highest record, which is rare in the past. It has been nine years since Shanghai and Singapore competed for this cup, and Shanghai has continuously maintained the championship for seven years. Even in this competition, Shanghai scored a total of 808 points, which is a great improvement over last year's 795 points. It was not easy.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>However, the news came that Singapore has made great strides and achieved this amazing result, winning the championship for the second time. This shows the rapid progress of the shooting skills of our Chinese people, and it is especially commendable that Singaporean Chinese merchants have persevered and not slackened due to repeated defeats.

<h3 id="e203">Anlegong's Violation of Regulations and Fines <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Japanese dancers failed to comply with the regulations to get vaccinations. The Anlegong Dance Hall at No. 57-59 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession was recently summoned to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by the police station for violating Article 3 of the Municipal Council's regulations on employing female servants in public entertainment venues. First, police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the case, saying that the defendant had been found to have violated the time regulations a week ago and was fined 100 yuan by the court. A month ago, the Municipal Council's Health Department sent someone to inform that all female employees and dancers in the venue must be vaccinated and inoculated with cowpox at the Municipal Council, and certificates should be presented when inspected by Municipal Council officials. However, it is now found that the defendant's venue ignored this and still did not send the dancers for vaccinations at the Municipal Council, which is a violation of the above regulations and should be punished. The defendant, Chen Zhanxiong, who was represented by Yan Bingxian, stated that there are more than fifty dancers in the venue, most of whom are Japanese women. More than ten of them have already been vaccinated by doctors and have certificates to prove it. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. An overseas employee of the Health Department then stated that the department had sent people to inform three times. The vaccination certificates of the Japanese dancers presented by the defendant were not from doctors who had registered with the department and could not be considered valid. After verifying the供 by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, he announced the end of the debate and immediately sentenced the defendant Chen Zhanxiong to a fine of 80 yuan for violating the regulations.</p>

<p>Debtor Claims Not to Have Seen Him for Many Days</p>
<p>Family Suspects Foul Play. Wu Yousheng, a Ningbo native, 51 years old, residing at No. 18 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, is currently engaged in the auction business, negotiating transactions at the Yiyuan Tea House on Wuma Road every day. He is quite honest and trusted by his colleagues. His business has been good in recent years. Although he has no large savings, he often has dealings with money shops. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 8th), he left home at 9:00 AM, carrying a money shop draft for more than 100 taels, intending to collect a debt of 240 taels from Shi A'ru, a current milk powder broker, in the Hekang Lane in the city's Nine Mu Di. He did not return that night and was reported missing. His family was extremely anxious and went to Shi's place to inquire, but Shi claimed that he had not seen Yousheng for more than a month and had not come, nor did he owe him any money. The family, upon hearing this, thought it suspicious because Yousheng had played mahjong with A'ru at the home of Shi's friend, someone Jia, the day before. Now he suddenly claimed that he had not seen him for more than a month and did not admit to owing him money, which clearly indicated other circumstances. In addition to reporting the matter to the British and French police stations for investigation, the family also submitted a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday requesting an investigation. Wu was wearing a black Xiangyunsha short shirt and pants and a copper pot hat when he disappeared. He has been missing for two days.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Recent News from the Jiyi Benevolent Society Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The Jiyi Benevolent Society in this city has been operating the epidemic hospital it established on Tangshan Road in Hongkou for nearly two months. The epidemic prevention work has never been relaxed. In total, the outpatient department has seen approximately 20,000 patients. Although the heat has recently subsided, the hospital still has around 400 patients every day, and many are critically ill. Therefore, although the equipment is sufficient, the wards are still overcrowded. This is because most of the residents in Hongkou are poor households who rarely pay attention to hygiene. The proliferation of factories, polluted air, and unclean food are all causes of disease. The hospital sees that the autumn epidemic is on the rise, and epidemic prevention work cannot be delayed. Therefore, it has expanded its premises to avoid the poor and sick from having to travel in vain. Moreover, the medical directors Lin Chunshan and Zhu Xiaofang have extensive experience with epidemics and do not spare any effort, working tirelessly day and night. All the staff members are also selfless and work together to ensure the safety of the epidemic victims. Therefore, although its history is short, its reputation has spread throughout Shanghai. People from afar come to seek treatment, and donations are made daily. The touching depth of their work can be seen from this. According to the hospital authorities, the autumn epidemic is originally easier to spread than the summer epidemic. In addition, most Chinese civilians lack common hygiene knowledge and do not regulate their daily lives, eating, and drinking habits. When they are sick, they do not seek medical treatment quickly, or they pray to gods and Buddhas or scrape away "sha." By the time they are sent to the hospital when they are critically ill, they cannot follow the hospital's regulations and often secretly bring food to patients, causing repeated complications and making treatment impossible. They greedily indulge in momentary pleasure, and in a blink of an eye, they will lose their lives without realizing it. This is truly lamentable. Those who bear the responsibility of advocating for society should pay attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Strength and Softness <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The person who has entered the academy says a word to console himself, which is: Softness can overcome strength. This is because he was poisoned by Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu saw the tongue and thought that softness was good, and saw the teeth and thought that strength was not good. He said: The teeth are strong and firm, and will fail first; the tongue is soft, and therefore survives.</p>
<p>Later generations extended its meaning, thinking that the tongue is often insulted by the teeth; if it is accidentally chewed by the teeth, the tongue does not dare to resist. However, over time, these thirty-six dental generals will inevitably die in battle one after another, but this non-resisting tongue will be unharmed until old age, which is called softness can overcome strength.</p>
<p>Alas! I don't think so. I only heard the teeth chewing off the tip of the tongue, and did not hear the tip of the tongue picking off the teeth. I only hear the quick knife cutting tofu, with both sides smooth; I don't hear that buying a piece of tofu can really be used to kill yourself on it. Strength can overcome softness is common; softness can overcome strength is just the weak eating a pill of peace of mind there.</p>
<p>The wounds of Shanghai and Songhu have not yet recovered, and the situation in North China is urgent again! Are our military authorities acting as tongues? Or teeth?</p>
<p>History tells me that the Han and Tang Dynasties advocated strength against foreigners, and although the Han and Tang Dynasties have passed, the names of Han people and Tang people still exist today; the Song Dynasty advocated softness against foreigners, and later generations called them Song Snot. If we insist on non-resistance, after Song Snot, there will be People's Snot!</p>
<p>Even if softness can overcome strength is effective, when softness can no longer be soft, it is better to be a shattered jade than a whole tile.</p>
<p>Occasionally reading Mr. Hong Beijiang's article on strength and softness, he also said: Even if it is said that softness can overcome strength, I would rather be a broken Longquan Tai'a sword than to survive as a wandering vine and tendrils.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Japanese Silk Weaving of Manchurian-Mongolian Handkerchiefs <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Fangmei</p>
<p>Yesterday I visited the art exhibition of the Chinese Society of Arts and Sciences. In the exhibition room of Shen Bao Photography Society's exhibits, I saw a Japanese-made silk handkerchief. It is collected by Mr. Li Yintan. It details the maps of Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Outer Mongolia provinces. Separated from Japan by the sea. The provinces of Fengtian and Jilin are the most detailed. The dangers of Lushun and Weihaiwei. The repairs of Yingkou and Shanhaiguan. It is clear at a glance.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the handkerchief. Attached is a list of Manchuria and Mongolia. Signed Showa Five</p>
<p>Year. It states the area (Four Eastern Provinces) of 656,000 square miles. Population of 33.7 million. 13 million cho of cultivated land. Agricultural products of approximately 1.3 billion yen. 220,000 Japanese (including affiliated territories).</p>
<p>We can see from this that the Japanese want to seize Manchuria and Mongolia. Its premeditation. All-pervasive. Even the slightest handkerchief. We must also link the maps of Manchuria and Mongolia with Japan on it. It can be said that it has exhausted the ability to invade. I have heard that Japanese elementary school students. Regarding the area, population, terrain, climate, products, transportation, etc. of Manchuria and Mongolia. They can all be known like the back of their hand. But we Chinese citizens. On the contrary, I feel at a loss. I studied this handkerchief three times. Really ashamed.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Clothing and Marriage <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Shizi</p>
<p>Women's clothing. Follows the trend. Moralists. Criticize it as a matter of public morals. Those who are conservative and outdated. Modern teenagers. Just see it as a woman of the previous century. For a woman who is just twenty years old. In terms of not yet obtaining the opponent's side. Then the way of clothing. Is the most difficult problem to solve. The parents of a woman around the age of twenty. Of course, it must be over forty or fifty years old. Those between forty and fifty. Have passed their youthful life. The ideas that arise. Of course, it is more stubborn than young people around the age of twenty. So for the clothing of the daughter under the knee. Often want to use the clothes that he wore twenty or thirty years ago as a benchmark. Seeing women's bare knees and exposure. As not caring about morality and shame. Seeing women's liberation of breasts. As hurting customs. I don’t know Ding Zishi. Two-sex combination. One is the agreement of learning and temperament. And the clothing issue. Also occupies an important position. Clothing can add a lot of beauty.</p>
<p>The relative's surname is Mr. Mou. There is a daughter who has passed the age of twenty. Love beyond the palm of your hand. There is no response to any request. But only on the matter of clothing. Then the restraint is extremely strict. Not allowed to follow fashion slightly. Marriage applicants. The number has exceeded a hundred. Ten years of procrastination. There has never been one success. Explore its reasons. Because the clothing is too ancient. And those who do not join. Accounts for three-tenths. Relatives and friends persuade him to adapt to the trend. Give up prejudice. In order to seek an early acquisition of Dongchuang, there are many Weng actually changed color and said. Those who judge people by their appearance. Has been the lower class. Those who use clothing as a criterion. Just纨袴 ears. I would rather have my daughter old with a hairpin. I don't want to accept 纨袴 in the nephew's hall either. This spring. The woman died of depression from consumption. Although the old man cried sadly. But he ordered the ancient majesty to be buried. In modern times, some people have sacrificed three for clothing. Most are trapped by the economy. Unable to keep up with the trend. And clinging to the view of硜硜. If the daughter of Mr. Mou. Then there is no money to buy. Special old father does not allow it. Causing the marriage to be repeatedly defeated by the fact that the clothing is too ancient. Even to the point of dying in depression. I heard of it. Sad and immovable. I hereby report his affairs to the public. Deeply hope to be parents. There is a woman and 䈂. Never treat today's strange clothes as not caring about morality and shame. As hurting customs. You must know that young women. If the clothing does not follow the trend. Marriage will be hindered. Youth will be delayed. The daughter of Mr. Mou. Can be a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Suzhou in Summer <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>The Red Emperor holds sway, and the scorching sun unleashes its might. Even in this blistering summer, there are notable events in Suzhou society. I write this while wiping away sweat, to truly speak freely.</p>
<p>The lotus blooms in summer, its redness enchanting and its whiteness translucent, hidden amongst the lush green canopy. Its fragrance spreads far and wide, its charm especially abundant. Among the places where lotuses grow in Suzhou, Huangtiandang in Panxi should be considered foremost. For ten miles, the green canopy extends. One can take a small boat early in the morning or at dusk, and drift in the middle of the stream, enveloped in fragrance. Alas, today there is a lack of people with the refined interest to bring famous flowers and fine wine, going to appreciate the lotus. Among the gardens in the city that have lotus ponds, the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Retreat and Enjoy Garden are the most famous. The Retreat and Enjoy Garden is not open these days. The Humble Administrator's Garden is also lacking in fine breeds, due to years of disrepair. The lotuses in the parks have recently become abundant. The three lotus ponds stand tall and lush, following the rise of the two gardens. However, as visitors to the parks are busy reveling in the beauty of face powder and rouge, how many can truly appreciate the pure charm of the lotus pond? It calls for a sigh.</p>
<p>As the scorching heat intensifies, the number of people catching the epidemic increases daily. The epidemic hospitals are constantly reporting that they are full. Therefore, the people of Suzhou, who have always valued superstition, are competing to raise funds to perform public rituals to protect the region and drive away the epidemic. The lives of Daoist priests have become extremely busy. Every day, as the setting sun approaches, the Daoist priests in the Sanqing Hall of the Xuanmiao Temple offer up oblations multiple times a day. Their attire is magnificent, and the flute music is melodious, arousing endless feelings of wonder. Recently, the Temple of the Plague General was the scene of a strange incident where police officers broke into the premises because the temple did not comply with the government's ban on public gatherings. This is truly a strange phenomenon in broad daylight.</p>
<p>The great Yellow Register Ritual for Rain that was performed at the Sanqing Hall ended the other day. As a result, a light rain fell. Unfortunately, the two brief showers quickly gave way to sunshine, truly proving the saying, "The rain you pray for is never much." However, superstitious people deeply believe in the boundless power of the Daoist priests. How laughable it is!</p>
<p>Qizi Mountain, outside Xumen Gate, sees its pilgrimage season on the first and fifteenth days of the seventh month. As early as the fifth day of the seventh month, more than a thousand devout men and women of the Three Elders Society of the Xuanmiao Temple went up the mountain to offer incense. During the day, they climbed the mountain, rushing between the scorching sun and burning incense candles. In the evening, when they descended, they indulged in rich food and wine. (The meals of those who go to Qizi Mountain consist of vegetarian food on the way up, and meat on the way down.) I, Zhu Wei, am not wise, and I sincerely fear that such superstitious behavior will cause them to seek blessings only to bring misfortune upon themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e232">A Brief Discussion on Seasonal Illnesses <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qiangcheng</p>
<p>The scorching sun hangs high, and the fierce heat is intense. During this hot summer, we often seek coolness to escape the heat, which can easily lead to illness. If one can eat less raw, cold, greasy food and sleep with clothes on, external evils will have no way to invade. Even if one becomes ill, it will be mild and easily treated. This year, the weather is abnormal. There was excessive rainfall during the plum rain season, and the climate was cold. Since the beginning of summer, it has been unusually hot and humid. As a result, many people eat raw, cold fruits and vegetables, and sleep with windows open, indulging in temporary comfort. Wind and cold thus invade, and dampness takes the opportunity to strike, causing a buildup. This leads to this ailment. In mild cases, it lasts two to three weeks, and in severe cases, two to three months. Dampness is sticky, and not easily dispelled quickly. Treatment should be gradual and not rushed. At the beginning of this illness, one can use medicines that dry dampness, such as Magnolia bark and Atractylodes lancea. But after a period of time, white rashes and red eruptions appear one after another. (At this time, the utmost caution is required. The danger to life lies in whether the eruptions are released smoothly or not.) This is a sign that the evil dampness is being released externally. It is crucial not to administer cold medicines, which would prevent the rashes and eruptions from spreading smoothly. It is also not advisable to use warming and drying agents. At this stage, one should avoid drying medicines to prevent injury to yin. How could one use warming and drying agents again? One must be cautious in this hot weather. I recall that last year, my friend Mr. Wang Feilong also suffered from this illness. Dangerous situations arose repeatedly. Whenever I went to treat him, my teacher always told me to use less warming and hot medicines, for fear of depleting yin fluids. The illness gradually healed after a month. (My esteemed teacher has considerable experience with this ailment.) A certain famous doctor in Shanghai, upon seeing cold limbs, assumed it was a deficiency of yang. He prescribed warming and hot medicines such as aconite, cinnamon, and roasted ginger, leading to a fatal outcome. Such cases are not uncommon. In cases of damp-heat disease, cold hands and feet are due to heat being trapped in dampness. Clear yang cannot be spread. If one uses light and clear methods to unblock, the limbs will become warm again. Those who practice medicine must be extremely cautious. (Respectful payment.)</p>
<h3 id="e233">A Record of the Zhenhai Warship's Southern Voyage <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>The Zhenhai warship is directly under the command of the Bohai Fleet. It has recently made a grand tour of the South Seas, marking the first time a Chinese warship has sailed to Taiwan. This voyage was made without external authorization, which can be considered an anomaly. It unexpectedly arrived in Songbin the other day, also marking its first visit to Shanghai. The captain, Sheng Jianji (erroneously reported as his brother Jianxun), is an accomplished individual in his prime. He hails from Nanhui, and is a fellow乡党. From a young age, he was spirited and determined. He devoted himself to his studies, emulating Zu Ti's striking the oar and admiring Zong Que's ambition. He first studied at the Yantai Naval Academy, and then graduated from the Jinling Naval Academy. He immersed himself in military texts, spending years in diligent study. With the talent of a scholar and the perseverance of a soldier, he is highly respected by his peers. He has been the captain of the Zhenhai warship for many years. Recently, the naval students of the warship have been practicing navigation. They set sail from Qingdao in late June, passing through the sea ports of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. Although they encountered rain, wind, raging tides and towering waves, they navigated the dangers with ease and have now announced their return. How joyful it is to know that the great peng bird has flown ten thousand miles with sails unharmed. Yesterday morning, I went to the naval dock at Gaochang Temple. I boarded the warship's private steam boat and, upon boarding the ship, shook hands with Captain Sheng and greeted him. We had a pleasant conversation about our shared hometown. I was treated to a lavish banquet, showing a deep friendship. Captain Sheng said that there are currently only three naval academies in the country: Weihaiwei, Mawei, and Huangpu. The Mawei Naval Academy is relatively complete. Before the Zhili-Fengtian War, Qingdao only had three military ships. Now there are a total of ten. Compared to the powerful warships of the other powers, it is like wearing tattered clothes and standing with those dressed in fox and badger fur, feeling ashamed of falling behind and having no place to hide. The longer a country's coastline, the more difficult it is to equip its navy. Countries are judged by the number of their warships. Evaluating our country's warships, it is only a comforting gesture. The situation is already shifting from black to white, and the trend is turning from green to yellow. The urgent task at present is to emphasize industry in order to enrich the people. If we can devote ourselves to the manufacturing of the steel industry and increase various types of production, in order to enrich people's livelihood, then the revitalization of the army and navy will be easy, and the foundation of the country can be strengthened. On the contrary, only focusing on increasing the military strength of a certain aspect is enough to harm the people, and the drawbacks are unbearable to speak of. This time, when the warship arrived at the port of Keelung in Taiwan, the overseas Chinese were overjoyed and warmly welcomed it, just like the Crusaders seeing Jerusalem. They then visited the museum, the Governor-General's Office, and various newspaper offices, and met with the Chinese Consul Yuan Jiada and the Governor-General of Taiwan, Suzuki, and naval officers. Then, the Secretary of the Bingshan Section was sent by Governor-General Zhongchuan to visit the Chinese Consulate in return, and also attended a welcome banquet at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. After inspecting the ports, there were many感慨. According to records, the people of Taiwan had been forced to change their nationality to Japanese before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. After the Sino-Japanese War, about 60,000 overseas Chinese went to Taiwan. The Japanese government imposed strict restrictions, especially towards the educated class. Most of those who went to Taiwan were laborers such as coal miners, barbers, and servants. Each port has an overseas Chinese association, with the general association located in Taipei. Only last year was a consul established. Chinese people are prohibited from establishing schools and newspapers there. Books sent from China are confiscated by customs. Overseas Chinese are trapped in the legal net, often being oppressed. The tragedy of a lost country is so cruel. Therefore, all overseas Chinese eagerly hope for the prosperity of their motherland. As they were about to leave, they all felt悲凉. They went to Dapeng Bay and felt it had great potential, but it has become a den of thieves, which is regrettable. The pleasant conversation unknowingly passed the time. Then, they visited the wireless telegraph room, the engine room, and the map room. The ship's navigator, Mr. Fang, said that the military maps printed in England are the best. The maps printed in Taiwan are mostly translated from English ones. China lacks anything comparable. In the center of the ship, there is a reading room, stocked with the Complete Library of Four Treasures and various magazines. The shelves are lined with books. Every department felt that the layout was neat and orderly. The soldiers were well-organized, polite, and knew etiquette. Then, I boarded a steam boat with Captain Sheng to return to shore and bid farewell. He said that they planned to leave Shanghai within a few days, and would avoid the scorching sun of the mainland by sailing at sea. The departure is no different from ascending to heaven. A farewell to the Shanghai waves, I don't know when we will meet again.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Gold Price Drops Five Taels and Eight Mace <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Extreme Volatility The gold market experienced extreme volatility yesterday, with wild fluctuations that seemed unstoppable, rising and falling as if in a fog. There was a difference of over ten taels between the morning and afternoon, causing great anxiety and making predictions difficult. Ultimately, the price continued to fall by around six taels. Trading was extremely chaotic, with frequent selling and buying back. This was likely due to the surge in silver prices and the continued rise in exchange rates by 1.75 points. Reports from the trading floor indicated strong buying by the US to maintain the international financial situation, leading to a decline in the Shanghai market. After opening lower, the price quickly broke 730 taels, greatly shocking the bulls. The Guangdong traders also showed a tendency to sell. Due to the severe shortage of foreign exchange, the market experienced a rapid decline of over ten taels, eventually breaking 720 taels. Subsequently, the exchange rate seemed to stabilize, and banks showed good buying interest, causing those who had sold in the morning to buy back. Short sellers who had profited also took the opportunity to cover their positions, leading to a sudden surge in the market, with a rebound of ten taels. The rebound was quite volatile. Later, the price settled around 728 taels. As it was Wednesday, and the hot weather persisted, the market was closed for half a day. Here is a recap of the morning's activity.</p>
<p>Morning Fluctuations The market opened sharply lower by 10.2 mace, at 723.8 taels, due to various reasons, but rebounded strongly by 1.65 points. The silver price surged by one point. Private telegrams also added 0.87 points. The forward silver market rose by over 0.8 percent, influencing the gold market. Ruixing took the lead in selling, but Yuhe, Hengxing, Yuan Wanxing, Shunli, goods and other firms resolutely bought, adding 1.67 taels, to 25.5 taels. Unexpectedly, Hengxing and Yifeng sold, and Bingxing, Yuanheng, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Xingyuan, Yingfeng, and Heng et al. also sold, losing 3.5 taels, to 22 taels. The exchange rate was very strong. Shanghai offered September US dollars at 30.08125. Brokers bought October British pounds at 19125. Wheat firms offered December US dollars at 31.25. Soon, Hengyu, Hengchang, Yongyuanmao, Yongtong, Taichang, Yuhe, Hongkangyong, etc. bought, rebounding 3 taels, reaching 25.1 taels. At this time, American Silver Co. offered October at 31 yuan. At 9:30, British pounds opened at a premium of 0.25, US dollars at 0.5 yuan, with the price returning to 23 taels to 3.7 taels. Yuanda, Yongfuxing, Yongyuantai, Daxing, Yonghengyu, Dadesheng, Zhifeng, Yongfuyu, Yifeng, Yonghengxingyuan, Hongkangyong, goods, and other hedging firms sold aggressively. The exchange rate became more and more slack. August British pounds were at 1925. Old Citibank offered September US dollars at 30.9375, December at 31.25. HSBC offered October at 125, November at a buying price of 375. Market sentiment weakened further, and prices declined rapidly, falling over 5 taels to 18 taels at 10 o'clock. For half an hour, the price fluctuated by only a few cents. Afterwards, banks absorbed November US dollars at 31.0625. Buyers suddenly flooded in. Hengxing, Yifeng, Yonghengyu, Tong Taichang, Zhifeng, Yong Zhaofengchang, Dalian companies, etc. bought back. Hedging firms and short sellers took the opportunity to profit, buying at low prices. At 10:45, the price was 24.4 taels, followed by a decline of 1.56 taels. At 11 o'clock, Hengyu, Changxiang, Fuyu, Hengxing, Yuanda, Daxing, Yong Tong Taichang, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, etc. had strong buying interest, and the exchange rate was even tighter. Wheat firms and Mitsui absorbed November US dollars at 31 yuan to 30.09375, December 125 to 0625, and the price rose by over 5 taels. At 11:30, it was 27.8 taels, briefly falling 2 taels, due to a slight retreat in buying interest. Bingxing, Fuyu, Hengyu, Qian Changxiang, Zhifengyong, and general retail short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and the price jumped another 3 taels, reaching 28.6 taels near noon, before slightly decreasing by 0.45 taels. The market closed at 28.2 taels at 12 o'clock, continuing to decrease by 5.8 taels compared to the day before. The highest price for half a day was 28.6 taels, and the lowest was 18 taels, a difference of 10.6 taels. The market was volatile and difficult to grasp. The total delivery was over 10 taels.</p>
<p>The Official Price Reduced by Eight Taels The official price was changed to 793 taels. Because the US dollar was quoted at a premium of 0.5 yuan, the discount was 70 taels, with a maximum of 75 taels, and then 65 taels, 8 taels less than the previous day. The registration fee and water supplement were both 28 taels.</p>
<p>Chaotic Trading Trading on the floor was lively, but volatile. In the morning, the bulls were heavily defeated, and the short sellers added to their positions, leading to a rebound. In total, Qian Changxiang, Yuhe, Tong Taichang, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, Hengchangyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, and Zhifengyong all had to cover their positions. Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Dadesheng, Hengyu, Fuyu, Bingxing, etc. sold and bought back. Ruixing, Yuantai, Daxingyong, and Fuxingyong all sold. Hengxing Yuan sold first and then bought back. Statistics show that selling was more prevalent. Both speculator Lu and Wu sold. Hengxing sold over 300 shares first, and then bought 600-700. Yifeng went short over 800 shares. Yifengyong and Yuanheng sold first and then bought. Other firms had irregular inflows and outflows, making it difficult to track. The Dalian companies totaled over 1,000 shares, balancing out. The Guangdong firms sold 1,200-1,300 shares, buying back over 700. The total number of shares for all firms was approximately 23,000.</p>

<p>Rumors of US Silver Relief to Boost Economy</p>
<p>Local Prices Increase Due to Chaotic Internal Market Yesterday's surge in the silver market was caused by the US's plan to rescue its ailing economy, leading to repeated purchases of physical silver. It is rumored that they will purchase a fixed amount of 5 million ounces per month, which strengthened the European market, allowing products to be shipped to the East. International exchange rates continued to rise by 1.25 to 1.75 points, making the local foreign exchange market very strong. HSBC increased its listing price, with British pounds increasing to 25, or 1 shilling and 8.825 pence, and US dollars increasing by 0.5 yuan, to 30.025 yuan. Hong Kong decreased by 0.05 yuan, to 76.25 taels. The rest all increased. The internal market was chaotic, with a shortage in the morning, then leveling out, and then becoming slack again, before stabilizing in the afternoon. The British pound rose slightly by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar rose by 0.25. The gold market experienced large fluctuations. Ultimately, it decreased by 6 taels. Trading among banks was lively, with tens of thousands of pounds changing hands, with different inflows and outflows. The US dollar volume was around 600,000 to 700,000. Gold firms sold more than they bought, with American Citibank, Chase, and others selling, while wheat firms had strong appetite. Citibank and Bombay came to buy September and October contracts. The market fluctuations were unexpected. In the afternoon, as it was Wednesday, there was no market as usual. The morning's transactions are recorded below.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rates The internal market was chaotic, fluctuating by about 1.875 points during the morning. The selling price in the morning was 1 shilling and 9.125 pence to 25 (August to November). The buying price added 0.0625. Pan Gen entered October at 25. Shanghai and East Asia traded August at 25. HSBC offered August at 125. At closing, the selling price for August was 9 pence, and November was 125. The buying price was 0.0625 to 1.875.</p>

<p>Market Sees Renewed Selling Pressure on Foreign Currency Yesterday morning, the foreign currency market showed no significant advantages for either buyers or sellers. Supply and demand were evenly matched, but the afternoon session saw sellers gain the upper hand, leading to a sudden change in the situation. Although the number of transactions was considerable, market sentiment was unusually weak, ultimately leading to a decline. The easing of silver loans was also due to a decrease in usage, preventing smooth circulation. As a result, silver lending rates fell.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Falls in the Afternoon, Silver Lending Rates Ease Further (Foreign Interest) The morning market was slightly better by 0.125, at 0.06885 yuan, but the afternoon market suddenly fell sharply, decreasing by 0.75 yuan, to 0.068775 yuan, resulting in a small decrease of 0.0625 overall.

<p>The cotton yarn market remains firm and continues its upward trajectory. Due to rising raw cotton prices, cotton yarn itself is strong, and the factory's costs are increasing. Futures prices are particularly firm. However, some are hesitant to advance due to the unfavorable environment in Shanghai, so the rise is relatively moderate.</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending upwards, with American cotton experiencing significant gains followed by minor retracements, and Indian cotton soaring. This has bolstered confidence. Recently, the calculated cost of imported cotton (in silver) has been higher than domestic cotton, leading to a prevalence of bullish sentiment. However, due to extended exchange rates, large players continue to sell. Overall, the key factors remain the prices of American and Indian cotton. Buyer sentiment is exceptionally strong, with expectations that spot cotton (標棉) will reach 35 taels.</p>

<p>The following is a second estimate of this year's cotton production and acreage in Tongzhou, as released by a foreign firm:</p>
<p>|                                                                     |                             |</p>
<p>| :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- |</p>
<p>| Due to severe flood damage last year and the low price of cotton relative to rice, this year's acreage is estimated to have decreased by about 20%. Despite excessive rainfall around planting time, conditions have been favorable since then, leading to healthy cotton plant development. Yields are expected to be at or above normal.

<p>| (Nantong County): Last year's severe floods resulted in a harvest of only 20% of normal, with an average yield of 26 jin of seed cotton per mu. Due to the impact of falling imported cotton prices, about 45% of this year's crops are cotton, and 55% are grains. Cotton acreage is down 20% from last year. Weather conditions have been favorable since planting, and cotton plant development has been good. In the worst-affected areas, cotton plants are over six inches tall, and in Xiangqiaoan, they reach 1.5 feet. |                             |</p>
<p>| (Haimen County): Last year's harvest was relatively good, but still only yielded 30% of normal, with a yield of no more than 40 jin of seed cotton per mu. This year's cotton acreage is down about 15% from last year, with cotton and grains each accounting for about half of the crops. Growing conditions are better than in Nantong, and yields are expected to be about 80% of normal. |                             |</p>
<p>| (Rugao County): Last year suffered the most severe flood damage, especially in Matang and Chahe, where yields were minimal, only 10% of normal. The county-wide average was only 15%. This year's cotton acreage is down about 25% from last year, with a 4:6 ratio of cotton to grains. Weather conditions have been favorable since planting, and plant development has been good, with cotton plants averaging 8-9 inches tall.

<p>Yesterday, the number of incoming shipments from various suppliers was limited, approximately twenty. Sales in urban and rural stores were poor, and the Zha market weakened first, followed by a general decline. As a result, thick and thin japonica rice prices fell by 0.2-0.3 silver dollars, and early rice also fell by almost 0.1 silver dollar. Foreign Dudu sharp goods were slow to sell, and the market weakened. Bianyin yuan was short of goods. 700 shi of Zhoupu new japonica rice arrived. The opening price was fixed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were about sixteen or seventeen shipments from the western route. Customer demand was non-existent. Scattered trading amounted to around 1,000 shi. In the morning opening, Changxi northern japonica rice fell by a small amount. Qingjiao, Shipu, Jiashan, and other early and late rice varieties saw no gains or losses. Bianyuan rice porters saw slight movement, with prices being tight. New japonica rice prices were similar to those in the South Shanghai market.</p>

<p>Imported rice prices slightly improved yesterday. Northern buyers inquired about Saigon rice, and Jiangbei and inland merchants arranged for the shipment of small-sized ground rice. While Hunan rice could be exported, the combined price was quite high, leading to optimistic sentiment. Prices recovered by 0.05 silver dollars compared to the previous session. High-quality small-sized ground rice was priced at up to 9.80 silver dollars, while ordinary rice was priced at 9.60-9.70 silver dollars. Old small-sized ground rice was priced at 9.35 silver dollars. A total of 5,000 bags were traded, including 2,000 bags of Saigon rice priced at 10.225-10.25 silver dollars. Except for 500 bags purchased by northern buyers, all Saigon rice was purchased by merchants in this street.

<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market saw a sharp decline across all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat quotations fell by 0.4-0.6 silver dollars. Extended foreign exchange rates and plummeting gold prices made it opportune for foreign wheat to enter China. At yesterday's highest exchange rate, the price of foreign wheat was only 4.0 taels. The market was unstable from the opening, effectively falling by 0.02-0.03 silver dollars from the previous day. Subsequent selling from factories like Fufu further dampened the market. Distant months were even more sensitive due to rumors about foreign wheat. Northern and Southern foreign buyers made minor purchases, but were unable to counteract the trend. As a result, the current month fell by 0.0275 silver dollars, September fell by 0.0325 silver dollars, October fell by 0.0375 silver dollars, November and December fell by 0.0425 silver dollars, and January fell by 0.04 silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Wheat Futures Follow Foreign Wheat Lower <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>But the decline was small</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a uniform decline across all months after the morning opening, with foreign wheat quotations falling by 0.4-0.5 silver dollars. Rumors of foreign wheat being traded at 9.5 mace were likely untrue. However, due to the extended exchange rate, peddling of foreign wheat was very active, and factories were constantly inquiring, which unnerved the market. However, due to the persistent drought, domestic sentiment remained bullish, so while the market declined, the magnitude was small. As a result, the current month fell by 0.03 silver dollars, and September through December each fell by 0.04 silver dollars. Spot wheat remained firm, with Suqian wheat priced at 3.6 taels, Yaowan wheat at 3.6 taels, Zhenjiang wheat at 3.42 taels, and Anting wheat at 3.32 taels, totaling over 1,300 bags.</p>

<p>Taikoo Sugar Market Slumps. Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants Association market saw slumping trading due to the sudden drop in the gold market and extended foreign exchange rates, which weakened sentiment and slowed transactions.

<h3 id="e255">Oil Market: Substantial Volume of Asphalt for Soap Making <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Asphalt is typically slow-moving during the summer, as candle makers cease production during hot weather, leaving only the soap-making industry as a consumer. In the last decade, numerous soap factories have sprung up in Shanghai, resulting in significant asphalt consumption. However, in the past three to four years, several major factories have been selling soap at exceptionally low prices, aiming to eliminate smaller factories. This has had a severe impact, with some smaller factories unable to survive and ceasing operations, while others have significantly reduced production. Local asphalt merchants previously enjoyed a steady stream of small orders from these factories from spring to summer, but this has now consolidated into larger transactions. Major soap factories typically purchase in bulk, making it difficult for smaller oil merchants to compete. Moreover, large-volume transactions offer very thin profit margins, leading some to withdraw from the market. Consequently, asphalt merchants are less enthusiastic about stocking up for the summer compared to previous years. Since two years ago, a grocery store in Nanshi has also started trading asphalt, specializing in sales to soap factories. Their annual volume is reportedly over 30,000 dan, far exceeding the capacity of dedicated asphalt merchants. Last week saw 2,000-3,000 dan traded at prices slightly above 20 taels, all from this grocery store. They source directly from Yichang and Shashi, bypassing merchants in Hankou, allowing them to offer lower prices. As a result, asphalt merchants have been forced to retreat. Current total inventory in Shanghai is estimated at 2,000-3,000 pieces. The market is extremely sluggish due to the lack of small orders from soap factories and the cessation of candle production. Activity is expected to resume after the Mid-Autumn Festival when candle production restarts. Recent reports from Hankou indicate extremely low inventory levels and strong demand. Sourcing has been halted for a long time due to hot weather preventing transportation. Macheng oil is priced at 16.2 taels, Jingmen oil is priced at 16.4 taels, Zhijiang oil is priced at 16.2 taels, Pingjing oil has no market, estimated at 15.6-15.8 taels, and Jinshi oil is priced slightly above 15 taels. Local oil prices are set, but there are no transactions, resulting in a very quiet market.</p>

<h3 id="e257">Throwing Away the Official Cap <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, because Zhang Xueliang possessed a large army, but lost the land of three provinces within a few days, and did not resist, and later Jinzhou was captured, also watching without helping. Now that Rehe is in danger, Beijing and Tianjin are shaken, the Central Government ordered Zhang to send troops to resist the violent Japanese and recover the lost territory. But Zhang made many threats and refused to send troops, so Wang threw away his official cap, vowing not to cooperate with Zhang. Zhang Xueliang saw that Wang Jingwei had already thrown away his official cap, and had no face to linger in his position. Although he did not sincerely want to resign, he could not help but throw away his official cap on the surface, and also asked to resign. However, he also said that the Premier of the Executive Yuan could leave immediately after throwing away his cap, but I, the commander of the army, cannot leave immediately after throwing it away, and must have an explanation. Therefore, although Zhang Xueliang did not sincerely resign, he did throw away his official cap to some extent. The ministers of various departments, because of Wang's resignation this time, were determined, and there was no room for retention. Therefore, the ministers of various departments of the Central Government, as the leaders of the responsible cabinet, had firmly resigned. In order to express their intention to advance and retreat together, they also threw away their official caps together. Although this kind of cap throwing was intended to persuade Wang to stay, it still counts as throwing away the official cap.</p>
<p>When Jiang Jieshi heard that Wang had thrown away his cap, he urgently telegraphed He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, etc., saying that Wang's resignation must be firmly retained no matter what. If Wang insists on not doing it, I will also resign. This means that Jiang is also willing to throw away his cap. However, Jiang's throwing away his cap is nothing more than expressing his determination to retain Wang, but it cannot be said that he is not making a gesture of throwing away his cap.</p>
<p>At a time when the international situation is very serious, it is truly unfortunate to throw away the official caps together, truly unfortunate. However, the main cause of this cap throwing is mostly due to Zhang Xueliang. If Zhang sincerely resigns, then many caps can be taken back. However, while Zhang expressed his resignation, he still expressed that his army must be commanded by someone. Whether he is sincerely throwing away his cap or pretending to throw it away, we can only wait and see what happens next.</p>

<p>How many generations in the region formed alliances,</p>
<p>I knew his name thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wind and clouds spread through Shanghai,</p>
<p>Giving way to Mr. Ye for recording achievements is appropriate.</p>
<p>A hundred and eight mani beads bind this body,</p>
<p>Enjoying Zen in his later years was also a predestined cause.</p>
<p>His compassionate heart wanted to save the suffering people everywhere,</p>
<p>Half for the sorrow of heaven and half for the pity of man.</p>
<p>(Mr. Ye was devoted to Buddhism in his later years and became more enthusiastic about charitable causes.)</p>
<p>Discussing the future with like minds,</p>
<p>Considering and repeatedly deliberating on stabilizing grain prices.</p>
<p>His grand plan was originally not inferior at the time,</p>
<p>And we still follow his guidance today.</p>
<p>(At the beginning of the Shanghai Grain Exchange, Mr. Ye was engaged elsewhere. I moved him with the righteousness of fellow industry and unity, and then we planned together.)</p>
<p>Worry and joy, gain and loss for ten springs,</p>
<p>Sharing the same boat in wind and rain, we were even closer.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have been afraid of passing by the yellow mud wine shop,</p>
<p>Another predecessor has withered away.</p>
<p>(In the past ten years, in our rice industry, Mr. Zhang Lejun, Mr. Yuan Zhusan, and other gentlemen have all passed away one after another. I truly cannot bear the feeling of the predecessors withering away.)</p>

<h3 id="e260">New Methods of Scientific Leather Making <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Ziwei</p>
<p>Leather has many uses, such as making leather shoes, leather bags, cloth belts, and wallets. These all use it as a raw material. This kind of leather must be soft, beautiful in color, strong, durable, resistant to water stains and sun exposure to be considered qualified. The raw material for leather is raw hide. The hides of various animals are the raw material. Then, potassium dichromate, alum, tannic acid, etc., are used to give it special effects, that is, it does not decay, does not harden, is durable, can waterproof, and is not afraid of sun exposure.</p>
<p>(1) Various methods of leather making The medicinal materials used for raw hides can be divided into three categories: (1) Animal oils are applied to the back of the raw hide and heated to gradually oxidize it into an oily leather. (2) Raw hides are soaked in vegetable tannic acid (i.e., bark) to become red leather. (3) Mineral substances are used to make leather. This method is divided into two categories: (A) Alum and salt are used to pickle the hide to make white leather. (B) Potassium dichromate or chrome alum is used to soak the raw hide to make a light green color, which is called chrome leather (commonly known as camel leather, which is a misnomer).</p>
<p>(2) Complete procedures for the new method of leather making (A) Preparation... Remove the dirt on the hide, make the hide swell, and make it easier to absorb the medicinal solution. (B) Tanning... Soak the hide in the medicinal solution to make it a strong leather. (C) Finishing... Tidy up and decorate it to make it beautiful and attract people to buy it.</p>
<p>(3) Preparation of leather making The preparation methods can be divided into six types: (1) soaking in water, (2) liming, (3) hair removal, (4) fleshing, (5) deliming, and (6) acid pickling. (1) Soaking in water is to: (A) remove unclean substances; (B) dissolve salt; make the hide easy to swell.</p>
<p>(2) Liming is to: (A) destroy the cells around the hair roots to make the hair fall off; (B) swell the hide surface to make it easier to absorb the medicinal solution; (C) remove the fat in the hide. The method is to soak the hide in lime water solution, stir it, and add some sodium sulfide. (3) Hair removal Use a dull knife to scrape off the hair. (4) Fleshing Scrape off the meat on the surface of the hide. (5) Deliming Wash off the lime water, the method is to soak bird droppings in water, take the clear solution on the surface, soak the hide in it, stir it frequently, take it out after about a week. (6) Acid pickling is to: (A) shrink the hide: (B) neutralize water and lime.</p>
<p>(4) Tanning and finishing There are two types of chrome tanning methods: (A) Use (A) (1) 5 pounds of potassium dichromate (2) 2.5 pounds of hydrochloric acid (3) 400 pounds of water (B) (1) 10 pounds of sodium thiosulfate (2) 5 pounds of hydrochloric acid (3) 40 gallons of water (based on 100 pounds of raw hide). First soak the hide in the two solutions of (A), take it out when it turns yellow, blow it for a day and night, and then put it into the solution of (B). (B) Use (1) Chrome alum 15 pounds, (2) Lead carbonate 4.5 pounds, (3) Salt 4.5 pounds, (4) Water 150 pounds (based on 100 pounds of raw hide). Put the swollen hide into it without stirring, the longer the better, so that the medicinal solution penetrates into the hide. After soaking the hide in the two solutions of (A) and (B), dye it to make it beautiful and shiny, and the leather making process is successful.</p>

<h3 id="e261">My Views on Improving the Kitchen <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Fearless</p>
<p>As Mr. Chi Fo said, the cleanliness of a kitchen is closely related to the health of a family. Therefore, the kitchen does need to be improved. Now I will write down my humble opinions and hope that the members will correct them.</p>
<p>1. The kitchen must be large In Shanghai, general capitalists/landlords only want to build more houses and collect more rent, so the openness of the houses has become narrower. The kitchen seems to be even more unnecessary in the eyes of the landlords, so it is as small as a dried tofu. However, in Shanghai, three or four households often live in a single Shikumen building. When cooking, they all gather in the kitchen. If there are too many people, it may not be easy to keep it clean? In the hot weather, three or four people are crowded in a small kitchen, and the heat and crowds are likely to cause epidemics. Also, because the houses are small, firewood and other kindling materials are piled in the kitchen. May I ask, in such a small kitchen, how can we be sure that there will be no danger? Therefore, I think the kitchen must be enlarged.</p>
<p>2. The kitchen equipment must be simple Since the kitchens in Shanghai are so small, as mentioned above, it will only be effective if the landlords are willing to show mercy and improve them. Otherwise, it is useless for us tenants to just talk about it on paper. Therefore, under the pressure of small kitchens, we can only make up for it by using simple equipment. The kitchen is already very unclean due to the oily fumes, and if we pile up unnecessary things, it will be even more chaotic and unclean. Therefore, I think that in addition to the necessary stove, the kitchen only needs a table for picking vegetables or cutting meat, etc. At most, we can put a bowl cabinet. As for rice straw and the like, it is best not to put them in the kitchen. Also, those who are slightly wealthy, it is best to whitewash the kitchen once a year, because the kitchen is the easiest place to hide dirt. Spiders and the like often weave webs in the kitchen. The above are just some temporary thoughts, and they are also the most superficial two points for improving the kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Re-Improving Dining <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw the publication in this journal of Mr. Yiyiguanzhu's suggestions for improving dining. After reading it, I have some doubts. Now I will state my humble opinions and hope that the wise will correct them.</p>
<p>What Mr. Yiyiguanzhu calls (communal eating) is that several people eat from the same bowl of vegetables or soup. After repeated dipping of everyone's chopsticks and spoons, this bowl of vegetables or soup will invisibly add a lot of saliva. If one of these people has tuberculosis or other infectious diseases, then his germs will inevitably spread from his chopsticks or spoon to the food. The other healthy people who eat this food contaminated with germs will be in danger.</p>
<p>The above is the meaning of Mr. Yiyiguanzhu. I think that in a family, since there are people with tuberculosis or other infectious diseases, in fact, the rest of the people should take extra precautions everywhere. Improving dining is not necessary, because the invisible spread of (germs) | in the air, on tables, chairs, utensils, etc. | not only in (communal eating), improving to (individual eating) can avoid everything. Moreover, this kind of communal eating has been passed down from ancient times to the present. Assuming that its danger is so great, then if it has been passed down to the present, modern China would probably have been difficult to exist.</p>
<p>As for (in recent years, Chinese people have been Europeanized in everything...), may I ask where is the Europeanization? Everything is still at the mercy of others and breathing the breath of others. What has been transformed is nothing more than public social interaction! Men and women dancing! All the romance! And what Mr. Yiyiguanzhu calls Europeanization, I don't know what it is? At the same time, I don't know whether Mr. Yiyiguanzhu also sympathizes with such Europeanization? (Reply)</p>
<p>Family Issues</p>
<h3 id="e263">A Family That Spoils Their Children <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>The old Ma couple next door are a pair of people who believe in spoiling their children, which has led to bad habits in their children. I will now write about it in detail below. The old couple has two sons and two daughters and runs a XX shop, and their livelihood is quite prosperous.</p>
<p>Their youngest son is almost twenty years old and has studied for many years, costing them several thousand dollars. However, he only knows how to wear Western suits, watch movies, and ask his parents for money, spending his days in laziness and idleness. His parents are believers in spoiling their children, so they let him squander his money. Sometimes, some relatives advise him to find a job, recommending him to a position in one or two companies, but, being accustomed to laziness and idleness, he naturally cannot devote himself to his duties, and the salary of thirty or forty dollars is not enough for him to squander for a few days, so after a few days, he is unwilling to continue working, returning home to enjoy comfort. This has happened many times.</p>
<p>He got married last spring, but he has no productivity, so of course all expenses are supplied by his parents. He has to change several sets of Western suits every day, which troubles the housemaid at home, who cannot keep up with washing the clothes.</p>
<p>The eldest daughter is also of marriageable age, and spends her days eating sweets and other snacks, especially liking to mingle with men, so her reputation is somewhat poor. However, her parents do not prohibit or control her. Like the family above, we can determine that they are corrupt, decadent, and also social parasites.</p>
<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e264">A School Divided for Spoils <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Zhang</p>
<p>I dropped out of school after graduating from junior high school, because the school I was attending at the time only had junior high school. To avoid mistakenly entering the countless "wild chicken" middle schools in Shanghai, I came up with a very pitiful and stupid method, which was to choose those famous schools with a long history. After carefully and meticulously reviewing the newspapers, I found that X Middle School was recruiting new students. I had long heard of X Middle School, and its name was like thunder in my ears.</p>
<p>In addition, I had a relative who was also studying there, so I resolutely went to take the entrance examination. Originally, I thought that the recruitment of the famous X Middle School must be very strict, and the exam questions must be very complex and difficult, but to my surprise, X Middle School's recruitment was not really an exam, and there were no exam questions. A recruiting teacher only asked where I had studied before, and also roughly asked about some book titles I had read in my previous school, collected a dollar for the registration fee, and looked at my diploma. The so-called entrance exam was over. He said very frankly, "You can come to pay the fees and start classes on XX month XX day." I walked out of X Middle School with a stomach full of doubts and surprise. Afterwards, I went to the home of a relative who was studying at X Middle School to find out the truth. According to his reply:</p>
<p>X Middle School was originally a very ordinary school, and the usual discipline was not very strict, and the students' grades were also very ordinary. After the January 28th Incident, X Middle School was indirectly affected by the war and became even worse. For some reason, other schools that were affected by the disaster all returned to their original state after the war, and students were pouring in and out of the stuffy, small classrooms in groups. However, X Middle School, probably because the students all lived in the war zone, only saw a sudden decrease in students and no increase. This made the school authorities very worried. With fewer students, the income from tuition fees naturally decreased, and with less tuition fees, the teachers' salaries naturally had to be reduced. Better teachers were naturally unwilling to hibernate here anymore and packed their bags and left voluntarily. Clumsy teachers, who originally regarded X Middle School as the only place to solve their livelihood problems, naturally could not leave, so they had to take on the heavy and important subjects concurrently. The clever and wise principal did not want to lose the achievements of hard work and the reputation in society over the years, so he came up with a very clever compromise: to avoid the teachers being resentful and complaining, and of course to avoid the school authorities losing money, which was to take the students' tuition fees, and after deducting a portion of the necessary school administrative expenses, the remainder was divided up like spoils: the principal taking X shares, the teachers X shares, and the school employees X shares. This fair method made the teachers very happy, so the bad habit of indiscriminately recruiting new students occurred, and you were also deceived by them." After hearing these words, I was silent, and at the same time I realized a great truth. China's territory is divided up into your piece and my piece, so naturally this phenomenon will also occur in schools. This is a natural thing, so what is there to be surprised about?</p>
