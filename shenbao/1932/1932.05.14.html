<p>時評</p>
<h3>三論中蘇復交彬</h3>
<p>或有難者曰。固矣。就今日之外交情勢而觀。我國自亟應對蘇復交。但蘇今雖已與列强大都發生邦交。然仍根本爲列强所忌。中國而欲對蘇復交。得毋將因而失列强之歡心。或且爲列强從中阻撓。我得一蘇聨爲與國。而反激起列强之嫉恨。則轉以增進外交上之艱難。此點吾人固不得不先爲周詳考慮。　　吾人則認爲持此一理由。以反對中蘇復交。其失爲過於怯懦。爲遷延苟安。此種畏葸苟安旦夕之態度。已足使我外交完全仰承他國之鼻息。服從他國之意志。受他國之推動。而本身則毫無主動力可言。故日軍强佔我東北。進犯我淞滬。我不能運用外交。自起而謀正當有效之對付。吾人誠不能不承認中蘇復交之阻力尚多。或不能否認對蘇復交將爲列强所嫉恨。但吾人如甘願長此被刦持於强力。甘願聽從他國之指揮。長困頓於事實上之共管局勢下。則亦已耳。如其不甘。如其尚欲圖存於未來太平洋上之爭奪大戰中。則我今後之外交權。萬不能不操之自我。換言之。即不能不打破一向聽從他人之苟安態度。確立適應環境之外交方針。以謀應付未來之難局。抑且一國之外交政策。祗講利害。不問感情。吾人今日所最應。認清者。如對蘇復交而果於我有利。則我即應决然促其實現。以我之國勢而言。地理而言。固不宜與蘇聨長此絶斷邦交。處於敵對之地位也。　　尤有進者。日法德意諸國。都早已與蘇復交。英國對蘇邦交。雖於保守黨組閣之際。再次中斷。但以經濟之關係。終於一九二九年尾工黨第二次執政。再度恢復。即終始與蘇但有經濟關係而無邦交之唯一大國之美國。今對蘇復交。亦正在積極醖釀中。行且實現。列强自身旣都已與蘇復交。則將持何理由以阻撓中蘇復交之實現。且此種阻撓究爲利我乎。抑爲害我乎。如其爲害。則我斷不能以遷就他國之意志。而自蒙實害也。故吾人認此顧慮。要亦爲失之怯懦。失之苟安。亦不足持以爲反對中蘇復交之理由。　　再就立國主義之立塲而言。蘇聨爲今日唯一實行社會主義之國家。而我國國民黨所奉行之三民主義。孫中山先生亦自認爲社會主義。則就兩國所奉行之主義。所追求之理想。所努力之目標而言。雖政府與制度。各自不同。而其未來爲人類謀幸福之偉大。目的則一。三民主義之黨政府。可與資本主義之國家爲友。則又何不可與社會主義之蘇聨復交乎。　　以故吾人力主對蘇復交。并深盼當局打破一切之阻力。斷然促其實現。</p>

<h3>汪院長之報告</h3>
<p>▲民意機關在積極籌設中　　▲停戰協定不含政治意味　　▲東北問題越加努力奮鬥國民黨中央黨部留京辦事處、九日舉行五九國恥紀念會、汪院長有重要報告、已略誌前報、茲將汪氏報告原文補錄如下、　　各位同志、今天是紀念週、同時是五九國恥紀念日、中央黨部同人委託兄弟對各位同志報告這一週間的工作、這一週間的重要工作、可以分兩部份來説、（一）關於國民代表會討論的經過、（二）關於淞滬停戰撤兵協定的經過、現在先報告討論國民代表會的經過、關於國民代表會的提議、是今年一中全會開會時、有幾位同志提出的、當時有國難會議國民救國會議和國民代表會三個提案、經一中全會决議、關於國難會議交由國民政府召集、國民代表會與國民救國會議、交常會討論、後來國難會議開會會時、有决議案送國民政府、請提前設立國民代表會、所以中央政治會議爲了這個問題、經過四次會議的詳密討論、兩次是正式會議、兩次是談話會、中央同人、因爲此種大案、關係非常重要、所以不願意隨便决議、在前星期一開了一次正式會議、星期五又開了一次談話會、上星期一又開了式會議、星期五又開了一次談話會、能使中央同人有充分時間來討論、彼此得多多交換意見、第一次正式會議所討論的結果、即把國民代表會和于右任同志所提的修正案、還有立法監察兩院民選半數委員的案、一起交付審查、星期五開第一次談話會、大家討論、在討論時、有很多要點、現在報告各位、所謂要點之一、就是根、建國大綱立言、民權的基礎、應由下而上、所以有了建國大綱第八條（在訓政時期、政府當派曾經訓練考試合格之員到各縣協助人民籌備自治、成爲一完全自治之縣）的規定、而後才有建國大綱第十四條各縣地方自治政府成立之後、得選國民代表一員、以組織代表會、參預中央政事的規定、因爲國民代表會的權很重、所以先俟地方自治完成、才得組織成立、我們看到總理的建國大　、有條不素、如果現在不等自治完成、而先成立國民代表會、與建國大綱所定程序、完全違背、這種意見、是有正確的理由、但同時又有一個　　、以爲總理除建國大綱明確規定之外、還教給我們一個因時制宜的方法、固然在民國十三年第一次全國代表大會開會時、總理提出建國大綱、九月、總理出兵北伐時、初曾以政府名義、頒布建國大綱、且附有極長的前文、但同年十一月、總理北上時、郤主張召集國民會議、國民會議、也是一種民意機開、可以證明不必一定等到建國大綱所定程序完成、才可以設立民意機關的、以上兩個要點、都有理由、故當時大家經過許多討論、其結果認爲訓政時期、中央民意機關可以設立、不過名義如何、職權如何、須經下次會議討論、這個結果、已於上星期一第二次正式會議决定了、到了上星期五開第二次談話會時、有主張用國民代表會名義的、有主張用國民參政會名義的、也有主張擴充立法監察兩院民選委員的、經多數同志的意見、以爲採用國民參政會的名義、較爲確當、理由是爲訓政時期、中央設立民意機關、以實際論、自然同國民代表會一樣、不過地方自治未曾完成、如用國民代表會的字眼、與事實不符、因爲按照建國大綱規定、每縣自治政府成立以後、才得選舉國民代表一員、組織國民代表會、現在自治没有完成、固然　咎政府遲慢、不能責備人民、但自治没有完成、終是事實、不顧事實、未免與總理所定建國大綱有矛盾之處、因此大家覺得折衷的辦法、就是中央民意機關、可以設立、而名義改爲國民參政會、與人民參預中央政事的意思相符、不過一方面國民參政會成立、詐多的民選代表選出了、而一方面立法監察兩院的民選委員、仍不取消、則成爲重複的民意機關、故大家覺得國民參政會成立、則以前所提之立法監察兩院委員民選半數之案、可以從緩、這是上星期五談話會多數同志的主張、預備歸納各種意見、在今天下午三時、開正式會議時再詳細决定、關於國民代表會討論經過的情形、大致是如此、這一件事是本黨目前很重大的事情、要達到完成訓政促進憲政的目的、培養訓政時期的民權、就在這一次會議來决定、關於淞滬停戰協定的經過、條文内容、已經在中央日報和其他各報批露、而且外交部　　長　表一　宣言、説得極其明白、諒各位部已見到、今天兄弟所要説的、只是其中最重要的兩點、（一）此協定是否包含有政治的意味在内、（二）此協定是否與東北問題分開、關於這兩點、兄弟可以説明、此次協定、如果含有政治的意味、即所謂以政治的條件來交換日本撤兵、那必定生出喪權辱國的危險來、政府絶對不肯做的、幸而此點已經避免、協定内容、没有政治意味在内、關於第二點、若我們祗希望解决上海問題、而東把北問題擱置、那是一樣的喪權辱國、政府也絶對不肯做的、我們認爲上海停戰會議、只是解决東北問題的一個步驟、上海有些人説、中國是整個的、爲什麽上海停戰撤兵、而東北却不停戰撤兵呢、須知道中國並没有和日本宣戰、如果正式宣戰、當然一起停戰、一起撤兵、然這一次政府的政策、是一面抵抗、一百交涉、所以無論在那一處地方、如日本來攻擊、我們便抵抗、如日本停止攻擊、我們便罷手、只要停戰撤兵協定、不含有政治條件則淞滬之停戰撤兵、與東北之繼續抵抗、是可以同時並行的、政治意味的會議、必須將中日整個的問題、尤其是根本問題、即東北問題、提出解决、絶對的不是解决了上海問題、便將東北問題置之不顧、這兩個要點、已經清楚、則可以知此次協定成立、固然不是我們滿意的成功、和最後的目的、但亦不是喪權辱國的契約了、至於東北問題、如何纔能解决呢、政府只有秉着一面抵抗一面交涉的政策去進行、關於這一點與五九國恥有同樣的感想、五九國恥、至今尚未洗雪、九一八以來的東北問題、至今尚未解决、政府决不因此次協定成立而放鬆、並且越加努力去奮鬥、軍事外交、關係固然重要、但據兄弟個人意見、内政更屬重要、因爲外交取决於軍事、而軍事取决於經濟文化和各種科學的組織與設備、而經濟文化和各種科學的組織與設備、又取决於内政的修明、故内政不修明、則經濟文化和各種科學的組織與設備、無法進行、軍事外交、亦永無辦法、自一二八以來、兄弟和蔣介石同志、商量關於内政問題、雖有種種應當改革的地方、但因題全目前各方面的事</p>

<p>實、故採取柔和政策、有些事情、雖要做而做不來、本來兄弟可以舉出很多的例子、現在祗槪括的説、這幾月來所取的政策、是柔和的政策、欲大家團結一致、共赴國難、雖對于各方面、有不滿意、但總要柔和的進行、關於這一點對不對、請各位同志批評、柔和政策與内政修明、有無矛盾、當然有的、但取了堅强政策、雖然可以减少牽掣、崦同時可以使團結分散、故想等各種條件齊備後、再來充實我們的力量、這是須請各位留心、並請各位嚴正批評的、總而言之、現在這個時局、我們决不敢放鬆一步、我在國難會議、曾經講過、政府對于目前難局、確定一個最低限度、在最底限度以上、我們可以忍受、在最底限度以下、我們非抵抗不可、二月二十日日本所提的哀的美敦書、我們絶對不接受、而簽訂此次停戰撤兵協定、就是爲此、現在我們簽訂淞滬停戰撤兵恊定、只是解决東北問題的一個步驟、不能説是已走上和平之路、以後還得要我們去犧牲奮鬥、今天紀念週、同時是五九國恥紀念日、十幾年的形勢、依然如此、所以我們犧甡奮鬥的精神、應始終如一、並且要一天天加緊起來、這是今天兄弟報告的大槪、贛省</p>

<h3>説愛爾蘭自由郎（中）</h3>
<p>— 開煦</p>
<p>愛爾蘭新總統佛勒拉氏之父爲西班牙人。母爲愛爾蘭人。故其所秉於天者。則爲浪漫堅强之個性。此上文已言之。故佛勒拉一生之事蹟。邱壑奔突。異聞軼事甚多。而其中最可傳誦者。厥惟其一九一九年越獄一事。因其事富有愛爾蘭民族堅强浪漫性質之表現也。佛勒拉數被逮捕。幾瀕於危。然終不死。其中若有天數焉。一九一六年春。愛爾蘭京城都柏林發生叛英革命。佛氏與其黨。均被逮入獄。後與佛同入獄者均已絡續飲彈殉國。惟佛氏因生於紐約。帶有美國國籍之故。遲遲未遽加以極刑。翌年以頒佈大赦而出獄。佛氏出獄後。立即召集所部。重組（新芬）黨。並擴大其革命運動。於是於一九一八年之五月。重以煽惑圖亂而被逮。禁錮於愛爾蘭之林肯獄中。佛氏此次之入獄也。有終身縲絏之懼。因愛爾蘭彼時民情鼎沸。革命思想。迷漫於全境。英政府之對於佛勒拉。一如今日之對於印度甘地。縱之不可。殺之亦不敢。於是惟有禁錮之一途。佛氏被禁後。其黨徒思欲脱之。於是有委員會之組織。該委員會曾遴選能赴湯蹈火之死士數十人。皆能作殊死戰者。圖刧獄而出之。然林肯四週。警備森嚴。知不可犯。於是不得不作第二想。數日之後。佛黨人有扮作農民。至林肯獄附近墾種者。暇則即獄旁高唱鄉間歌曲。有時雜以高爾族之俚詞。愛爾蘭鄉人本好歌。獄卒不以爲意。不知佛黨已於歌唱之中。用高爾族語言。傳達命令。互通聲氣也。故獄外之如何布置等等。佛氏在獄中悉知之。佛氏復受營救者之命。作獄後巨門鑰匙之印。擲諸田中。於是假鑰亦告成。然荷槍實彈之守衛將如何處置之。不久即籌得一法焉。</p>
<h3>自由雜感</h3>
<p>— 關重樓</p>
<p>自由兩字的解釋。就是説人生要以個人爲單位。凡事須由自己作主。不能受他人的限制。人生如果得不到自由。就好像樊籠中的鳥。一樣失掉了生存的樂趣。所以（不自由。毋寗死。）的兩句話。就是對於一般失掉了自由的人們而言。　　傀儡可以任他人播弄。僵屍可以任他人擺佈。傀儡。僵屍。這些都是失掉了自由的東西。（如果失掉了自由。倒不如死了乾凈。）從這點我不禁想到理三省那些傀儡僵屍們。　　自由是有界限的。西諺云。（自由之定義。乃指不侵犯他人之自由而言。）可知自已想要自由。先要尊重别人的自由。日本這次出兵我國。理由是爲保護僑民。制止排貨。目的無非是要日人在中國自由的行動。日貨在中國自由的暢銷。但是日本這次出兵的結果。却屠殺了我國不少的人民。摧毁了我國不少的財産。而反日運動越發在我國熾烈起來。這就是一種教訓。（以武力覓取自由。適得其反。）所以日本人要以侵略達到他們自由的目的。也徒見其心勞日絀而已。　　全世界有靈魂的生物。無不渴望着自由。全世界被壓迫的民族。無不渴望着脱離帝國主意者的枷梏。（理想爲事實之母。）自由平等的生活。總會在我們期望的不遠的前途實現。</p>
<h3>支那女兒</h3>

<p>支那乃日人對我鄙棄輕薄之稱謂。但予今用以題吾文者。所以用作激勵。劉大杰寫愛國小説。用作書名亦本此旨耳。去歲東北事變。我當局雖持不抵抗主義。民情沸騰。青年奮起投軍。娟嬋不讓鬚眉。上海援馬團出發。即有女團員參加。紅粉金戈。傳爲佳話。惜該團終未出關。且致星散。滬事旣起。馮大義勇軍天津骷髏團中無不有女戰士。防守殺賊。無殊於男子。且有許多無名女英豪。直接間接。隨時隨地。爲國宣勞。日前讀日本報紙。載上海通信。謂拾得一中華女戰士之日記。爲之驚異折服。東瀛倭奴。從茲當不敢再小視支那女兒矣。</p>
<h3>茶酒蠱疾</h3>
<p>— 碧城</p>
<p>▲茶蟲遜清乾隆中。吳江毛愼甫素嗜茶。一飲數甌。每出門。必以紙裹茶少許置袖中。時取嚼嚥。終歲面黄瘠。若有病然。後忽不爾。或問之。則云。某年在舟中。憑舷而吐。忽一蟲自喉間出。色碧。長數寸。隨流而逝。自此遂不復嗜茶。面色漸轉紅潤、後壽至八十餘。精神猶瞿鑠。意其吐出之蟲。殆即清異錄所稱斛二之類歟。　　▲酒鼇前年在吳門張氏席間。有客談酒鼇事甚奇。客光福人。謂里中有業木工某甲者。素嗜酒。所得工資。悉以付酒家。久之成病。不任工作。一家數口。幾至凍餒。病久不治。一日。甲適在門首。有游方僧過之。諦視甲。謂爾病酒乎。曰然。僧言我能治之。惟略有痛苦。亦不過片時。能耐之乎。甲妻亦在旁。皆言能耐。問需酬幾何。僧言不計。於是夫婦咸喜。問治法奈何。僧曰。須在空屋中。任余所爲。從之。命以繩縶手足。妻有難色。甲曰。病亦死。我不畏也。旣縶。令偃臥於地。而以好酒一甌置其前。甲嗅酒。涎埀垂自口出。少頃。腹中作痛。久之。痛益甚。達於胸次。大聲呼救。僧戒其要勿動。曰無使功敗垂成。稍耐即已矣。又有頃。一鼇若銀幣大。自口出。躍入酒甌。色背黑腹紫。游泳酒中。僧即解其縶。痛亦若失。其後病漸愈。不復嗜酒。</p>
<h3>電影之將來</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>曩讀美國雜誌。悉大發明家安迪孫氏。於某次演講。曾謂電影之發明與進步。據其理想。可分爲三期。由活動表演進而至於傳音發聲。可説已達第二步之成功。將來再研究改進。即可不需銀幕。在任何地方開映。祇須一經配合。電影即來。觀者處身其間。幾疑其電影明昨珂以接觸。至此始抵神化之境云云。當時聆者或以爲未能成功。而安氏死後。此種理想更多疑其難於實現者。不意新近英國傳來消息。謂空中顯影之術。經彼邦科學家研究。大致已告就緒。將來公諸世界。則銀幕兩字。行將不適於用。事屬新奇。我知抱有影癖者。自必以先覩爲快也　　據原文所載。謂自電影發明之後。即覺頗有缺點。其中之一。厥爲銀幕顯影。始終在一平面之上。而不能任意旁觀側視。此與普通畫片在放大鏡中逼視。其情形相異者。不過活動與不活動之别而已。故今日市上所映之影片。寗能謂爲逼眞。不久之將來。行見有最新式之電影出現。用法頗簡。而開映之時。能使觀衆疑爲男女演員當塲表演。絶不似來自影片。並已經過多次之試騐。確可稱爲維妙維肖。現在上述之發明人。對於空中顯影之秘密。尚未公開。内容詳細。無由探悉。所可知者。即此種電影。不用銀幕。廳堂及會客室内之任何部分。均可放演。景物演員。皆在空氣中。蓋開映之機。配有各種光鏡。殆應用光波折射之理耳。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（五一）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第七回干謁到家門常使將軍顚倒幽覊在情獄卒能夫婿牢籠　　話説北京城裏有一條最有名氣的金鑲玉胡同。内中有一連牽很多的大宅門兒。但頂兒上尖兒上最大最闊的一家。還推新近所造成的葉宅。那便是葉督軍作章所蓋的新宅子。他花了無數的錢。把這所宅第蓋得窮奢極麗。簡直還可算是中外合璧與建築大全。中式的如大四合庭院、戲台花園、樓臺亭閣等等。無一不備。西式的也另有兩座洋樓、將餐廳舞塲浴室球房各樣設備齊全。差不多中外各種建築物。都可以在他宅裏尋得出一種標本。雖然包羅萬象。可稱豪舉。只可惜太不諧和。像一碗大雜燴菜似的。自從落成以後。他本人在外省做督軍。難得到北京來一趟。總共没曾在這宅裏住滿過十天。這回爲了來京參預什麽軍政大會議。棨節重臨。住在這宅裏。不覺荏苒半月。這一來。這條胡同便更爲熱閙了。每天從朝到晚。來往的車馬十分擁擠。幾乎没把這條狹隘的胡同漲破破。那都是出進葉宅的各色人等。爭先恐後奔競奉伺所造出來的興盛。有時若是葉宅中有什麽大宴會與大堂會。來客太多。還須特定交通路線。由一隊武裝軍警把在臨近大道的胡同東口上。專許汽車開進。其餘馬車及人力車。座客要下車來步行。并且許進不許出。凡是從葉宅出來的汽車。須繞出西口外另假他道。也另有門崗及西口上軍警彈壓指揮。常常照料到深更半夜。還是汽車嗚嗚的絡繹不絶。直吵得附近隣居全討不著好覺睡。這有一天。在下午四點來鐘的時候。葉宅大門外的汽車。正一輛一輛的相繼而來。不知到了多多少少千奇百怪的客人。却單有一輛。下來的是個嬝嬝婷婷豓妝麗質的女客。門房外邊有兩個閒立著的馬弁一眼瞥見。就互相私語道。上頭此刻還没呌開條子。這一個娘兒們又似没曾見過。可是長得眞俊。氣派也不小。不大像窰子裏的貨色。却又没帶隨從。也不像那一家的闊太太。這是個啥路數呢。説時。那女客緩步而行。已逕自踏進了大門。</p>

<h3>肥皂的製法</h3>
<p>— 月照</p>
<p>西曆紀元七十九年，西人補里義氏的著作内，載有哥倫人發明用木材的灰和石灰混合於水中，便成氫氧化鉀（PotassiumHydroxide分子式是KOH）的溶液。將這種溶液和油脂同煑到相當温度時，便取去火，使牠冷却，結成固體，就成爲洗滌的肥皂了。　　現在各國的製造廠，都是沿用這種方法。不過用氫氧化鈉（SodiumChloride分子或是NaOH）來代替氫氧化鉀，因爲氫氧化鈉和氫氧化鉀的性質是完全一樣的。製造的時候，就是把牛油（猪油也可以用）放在鍋内加熱，使牠逐漸溶化。等到完全溶化後，便將氫氧化鈉的溶液，注入鍋内，用力攪拌，使和牛油混合，到液面上發生了泡沬後，便把火熄滅，把這些泡沬除去，再另取純粹的食鹽放入鍋中，仍照舊攪拌，過了些時，就有白色的粉末浮上來。然後把這些粉末放入模型内，一遇了冷，漸漸的　結起來，就成爲普通的洗衣肥皂了。　　香肥皂的製法，也是和普通的肥皂相同。不過加入食鹽後，必須把浮上來的白色粉末取出來，用清水洗滌，然後加熱煑沸，注入香料或消毒的藥劑，再放入模型内，等牠遇冷凝結，就成爲香肥皂了。　　肥皂何以能洗去污垢？這因爲肥皂是牛油和氫氧化鈉做成的。一遇了水，一部分便分解爲氫氧化鈉，一部分便分解爲脂肪酸。這氫氧化鈉含有鹹性，能和污垢結合，沉入水底；又能發大泡沬，黏浮污垢於水面：脂肪酸很膩滑，可以帮助洗滌。所以肥皂是洗滌的必需品啊。　　除了用肥皂洗滌外，還有石碱和灰汁，也可以作洗滌之用。因爲石碱和灰汁都含有鹼性，去垢的功效，也和肥皂差不多，不過没有脂肪酸的帮助。而且所含鹼質太多，容易損壞被洗的物件，這是不能不注意的。</p>

<h3>車夫階級和猪玀的口號</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>一輛電車在風馳電掣的向前面開去的時候，經過十字路口，突然横裏開來了一輛汽車當路，電車裏的司機者，急忙殺了車，才免於彼此的衝撞，那時司機者因爲那汽車夫躭誤了他的光陰和路程，嘴裏定會很自然的駡一聲（猪玀）！而那時這汽車夫爲免於罰欵起見，惟有默默無言的接受了那（猪玀）的雅號，　　一輛汽車正在開足了馬力，在前進的時候，突然有一個黄包車夫，拖了一部黄包車，擋住了他的去路，那汽車夫殺車以後，便會很自然的駡出一聲（猪玀）來！黄包車很聰明，知道汽車中坐的是闊客紅人，那裏敢和汽車夫爭執，領受了（猪玀）的雅號之下，也祇有默默無言的飛跑了去，　　一輛黄包車經過，車夫正用足了全身的吃奶力，拚命地把車子拖向前面去的時候，忽然對面來了一個小車夫，他的小車上滿裝了七八袋米，他正在額汗淋漓如螞蟻般的把那小車緩緩推動，幸虧黄包車夫眼快，留住了脚，否則便要和小車衝撞，那時黄包車在盛怒之下，也會很自然的向小車夫駡一聲（猪玀）！小車夫和黄包車夫本來都是不幸的苦工，但比較的還是黄包車夫高作一些，所以小車夫也祇有一溜烟加快腿力，向前推去，不和黄包車夫爭執而默受這（猪玀）的雅號了，　　這種情形，我們祇要在上海住過幾個年頭，在馬路上便會時常發現，而在這裏，我們也可看出車夫之中，階級也分得很清，此外路上的行人，跨越馬路的時候，險被開快的電車或汽車輾斃在車輪下逃掉性命以後，司機者或汽車夫殺車以後，也會駡一聲（猪玀）！那人在驚顫之下，心魂未定，自然也不計較有人送（猪玀）的雅號了，駡人的俗句很多，但車夫所駡的，第一句十九是猪玀，所以（猪玀）兩字，在無形中，已成爲車夫駡人的共同口號，這也是上海所特有的駡人藝術中的一種佳構吧？</p>

<p>余友×君，是中等學校的教師，年二十八，尚未得偶，煩悶之餘，輒以此事與余商確，余勸其毋急，忽蹈（急婚）之害，　　日前郵局投一紅箋來，啓緘視之則爲×君之訂婚通知柬、其詞句頗奇特，謂之合於時代性歟？抑合於投機性歟？則余不敢斷，錄之以供談資，　　敬啓者小兒××小女××現由××兩先生之介紹，於五九國恥日忍痛訂婚。以示不忘國恥之意（作者是仿訂婚不忘國恥，國恥不忘訂婚之口吻）特此　　奉聞，×××仝敬啓　　我看了以後，腦海中不禁起了一團疑，（訂婚也有忍痛的嗎？忍痛訂婚是否表示將來共同雪恥之决心。）這不禁使我腦海中起了一個絶大的疑問。　　作稿至此，老友Ｐ君説道，（老張你太糊塗了，忍痛····是多麽時髦的名詞，摩登的詞句！你不見得忍痛開市，忍痛娛樂，忍痛跳舞，忍痛打牌，忍痛···嗎？甚至政府也在忍痛開會，忍痛簽字，忍痛···嗎，全國上下，萬事萬物均在忍痛，訂婚亦豈能例外呢？</p>
<p>有　必</p>
<h3>電車裏</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>大槪久居上海的人，無不知上海行路之難，而尤其在公共汽車和電車内爲最危險，假如你的衣袋澎漲起來，不管裏面是些什麽東面，必得承胠篋朋友們的光顧，又如你戴了一頂漂亮的帽子，坐在電車廂裏，當車子駛過十字路口時，一刹那間就會不翼而飛，使你眼望着他遠颺而徒呼負負。　　上星期五晚上，我因事從卡德路趁在路電車往偷鷄橋，過了幾站，乘客漸漸擁擠了，不久，從三等車廂裏走進兩個穿黑長褂子的朋友，站在我的面前，他們並不買票，我想他們定是有月季票的吧？車到了泥城橋，躍下了一個，一霎時車便到了偷鷄橋，乘客多魚貫而下，最後我也立起來準備下去，不料面前的那位朋友，故意横在我身前，我猛然覺得一隻手在衣袋上一摸，回頭一看，衣袋上揷着的自來水筆失踪了！我恍然想到那兩位朋友所以要替我當臨時保鑣的理由。　　於是我急掉轉身來，把我身邊的嫌疑扒手抓住，他也十分鎭靜，擄起長袍子。讓我搜查，但是，經騐者告訴我，你搜查是無補於事的，扒手不祇是一個，誰能斷定他不把贓物傳給别人呢？</p>
<p>（我早就教你們乘客當心袋袋裏呀···）當我下車時，買票員高聲的説着，表示盡職服務的樣子，其實他何嘗這樣關照我，而且我一面請他慢些開門，讓我有鳴捕搜查的機會，他一面依舊開門，讓扒手乘間逃脱了啊！　　到底社會上揩油的朋友是怕他們的威權呢？還是如政治舞台上的（官官相護呢）？我懷疑着。</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3>稿費</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>因某君在××雜誌發表的（國難期間應有之認識）一文，説得句句血涙，頭頭是道，令我景仰得五體投地！　　今天上國文課的時候，張君對某君説：（昨天下午，我見你和你的她，在北京戲院門口走進去，我喊你，你却理也不理。）　　（我實在没有廳見，對不起。你説我的她，那我不敢當）。某君抱歉地答　　（總之，你專會欺人。這幾天你不是愁欵子没有匯來，但是聽説你昨晚還是坐汽車進來，難道看電影，坐汽車，都是免費的嗎？你爲什麽裝得這麽窮，又没人向你告借）！　　你又來了，實在告訴你，我昨天剛才從××雜誌社，領到稿費，那篇（國難期間應有之認識）的稿費。　　（噢！談戀愛，看電影，坐汽車，就是國難期間應有之認識的稿費？）</p>

<h3>Third Discussion on Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Some may raise concerns, saying: It is indeed true that considering the current diplomatic situation, our nation should urgently restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. However, although the Soviet Union has now established diplomatic ties with most of the major powers, it is still fundamentally viewed with suspicion by them. If China were to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, wouldn't that risk losing the favor of the major powers? Or perhaps even face obstruction from them? We might gain the Soviet Union as an ally, but in turn, provoke the envy and resentment of the major powers, thus increasing the difficulties in our diplomacy. This is a point we must carefully consider beforehand.</p>
<p>We, however, believe that holding this reasoning to oppose Sino-Soviet diplomatic restoration is excessively timid and amounts to a policy of procrastination and complacency. Such an attitude of fear and complacency would be enough to make our diplomacy entirely dependent on the whims of other nations, submissive to their will, and driven by their impetus, leaving us with no independent initiative to speak of. Therefore, when Japanese troops forcibly occupied our Northeast and invaded our Shanghai region, we were unable to utilize diplomacy to initiate a proper and effective response. We cannot deny that there are still many obstacles to Sino-Soviet diplomatic restoration, or that it will be met with jealousy by the major powers. But if we are willing to be perpetually held hostage by force and forever subject to the dictates of other nations, trapped in a de facto state of co-administration, then so be it. If we are unwilling, if we still aspire to survive in the future great struggle of the Pacific, then our future diplomatic rights must be firmly in our own hands. In other words, we must break away from the complacent attitude of perpetually obeying others and establish a diplomatic policy that adapts to the environment to cope with the future difficult situation. Moreover, a nation's foreign policy should only consider interests, not emotions. What we must recognize most clearly today is that if restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is indeed beneficial to us, then we should resolutely work to achieve it. Given our national strength and geographical location, it is not appropriate for China and the Soviet Union to remain in a state of severed diplomatic ties and antagonism for so long.</p>
<p>Furthermore, countries such as Japan, France, Germany, and Italy have already restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Although Britain's diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union were temporarily suspended again during the formation of the Conservative Party's cabinet, due to economic considerations, they were eventually restored again in late 1929 when the Labour Party came to power for the second time. Even the United States, the only major power that has consistently maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union but lacked diplomatic ties, is now actively preparing to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and will soon achieve it. Since the major powers themselves have already restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, on what grounds will they obstruct the realization of Sino-Soviet diplomatic restoration? And would such obstruction be beneficial to us or harmful? If it is harmful, then we absolutely cannot compromise to the will of other nations and inflict harm upon ourselves. Therefore, we believe that this concern is also a matter of being timid and complacent and is not a sufficient reason to oppose Sino-Soviet diplomatic restoration.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the founding principles of our nation, the Soviet Union is the only nation in the world today that truly practices socialism. And the Three Principles of the People, which our Nationalist Party upholds, are also considered by Sun Yat-sen himself to be socialist. Thus, in terms of the principles, ideals, and goals pursued by both countries, although the governments and systems may differ, their great aim of seeking happiness for humanity in the future is the same. The party government of the Three Principles of the People can be friends with capitalist countries, so why can't it restore diplomatic relations with the socialist Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Therefore, we strongly advocate for the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and deeply hope that the authorities will overcome all obstacles and resolutely work to achieve it.</p>
<h3>The Takeover Committee Continues to Dispatch Personnel for Acceptance</h3>
<p>Accepting Zhabei on the 16th</p>
<p>Today, sending personnel to inspect first</p>
<p>The Pingjin Police can arrive in Shanghai this afternoon</p>
<p>The Withdrawal Area Takeover Committee received notice from the Japanese side yesterday that the Japanese army will begin withdrawing its troops stationed in Zhabei starting on the 16th. The first step is to withdraw from the area south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The area north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be withdrawn in two phases. Our side immediately notified all relevant bureaus to prepare everything. At the same time, the takeover personnel for the Zhabei Baoshan area have been officially assigned, and it was decided that police captain Huang Ming and ten others from the Public Security Bureau will be sent to Zhabei today to inspect and make arrangements in advance. As for the 500 Pingjin police officers, they arrived in Kunshan last night and should be able to arrive in Shanghai today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The area south of the railway</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese army's withdrawal process in the Zhabei area, the first step is to withdraw the area south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and the area north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be withdrawn in two phases. Therefore, our takeover procedures are scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 16th, when Wen Yingxing will lead the Pingjin police and others to take over the Zhabei area south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. After 9:00 AM, schools, organizations, and others will continue to take over their respective related sections. As for the area north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, it will be taken over after the second notification from the Japanese side.</p>
<p>▲ Inspecting Zhabei Today</p>
<p>The Takeover Committee, due to the Japanese authorities having confirmed that the Japanese army in Zhabei will be withdrawn in stages starting on the 16th, has sent Inspector Gong Baixi and Police Captain Wang Ming from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with eleven others, to conduct a general inspection of the Zhabei area today. Inspector Gong and others held a meeting at the Joint Association before going to Zhabei to determine the tasks for the inspection. In addition, Li Mingyang, the director of the Security Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, who was originally scheduled to inspect areas such as Liuhe, Jiading, Nanxiang, and Luodian yesterday morning, did not do so due to the rain and is scheduled to depart for inspection today.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Personnel to Take Over Baoshan</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed in Shizilin, Yangxing, Dachang, and Zhenru have not yet determined a withdrawal date. After negotiations with our side, it was decided that they would withdraw within a short period. The Takeover Committee sent Sun Xiwen, the magistrate of Baoshan County, yesterday to handle the takeover of Baoshan County. Lu Fengpu, the second district chief of the county, was sent to handle the takeover of Dachang. Wang Qingtao, the first district chief, was sent to handle the takeover of Yangxing. In addition, Huo Shi, a special commissioner of the committee, was sent to assist Magistrate Sun in taking over Baoshan, Tao Xiaojie to assist Lu Fengpu in taking over Dachang, and Liu Yumen to assist Wang Qingtao in taking over Yangxing.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Personnel to Take Over the Fortress</p>
<p>After our army retreated to the rear, the two fortresses of Wusong Shizilin fell to the Japanese army. Now that the Japanese army is gradually withdrawing, the takeover of the two fortresses should be prepared in advance. The Takeover Committee sent Shi Ze as the takeover personnel for the Shizilin Fortress, Chen Wen for the Wusong Fortress, Song Lichen for the Sanguantang Ammunition Depot, and Cao Jinbai for the Taiwan Barracks. In addition, Liu Shouyu, Lin Tong, Liu Xi, Kang Renchu, and others were sent to assist in the takeover of the above-mentioned agencies. Once the Japanese side sets a withdrawal date, these personnel will depart.</p>
<p>▲ Pingjin Police Arrived in Kunshan Last Night</p>
<p>The Takeover Committee received a telegram yesterday morning from Wu Siyu, the director of the Capital Police Department, stating that the Pingjin police would arrive in Pudong at the time of Yuanzi on the first day of the month. They would depart from Nanjing for Kunshan on the morning of Yuanzi. However, another telegram was received yesterday afternoon stating that the Pingjin police had already departed from Nanjing at noon yesterday and would arrive in Kunshan last night. After receiving the telegram, the Takeover Committee telegraphed the magistrate of Kunshan County at 3:00 PM yesterday, asking him to hire several small steamers and tugboats to prepare for the arrival of the Pingjin police in Kunshan and immediately set sail for Shanghai. It is expected that they will arrive in port this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Negotiating the Return of Vehicles Detained by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army entered Dachang and Liuhe, all commercial and civilian vehicles in the war zone have been arbitrarily detained and used for military purposes. The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company has had particularly many vehicles detained. The company submitted a document to the Takeover Committee yesterday, requesting negotiations with the Japanese side for the return of the detained vehicles. After receiving the document, the committee ordered Special Commissioner Tao Xiaojie yesterday to go to the Japanese consulate with the company's staff to negotiate the return of the company's detained vehicles and all machinery. The Japanese consulate promised to investigate and respond to the matter.</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government Plans to Rectify</p>
<p>After the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, the Zhabei area bore the brunt, turning a prosperous city into ruins. Now that the Japanese army has decided to withdraw its troops stationed there starting on the 16th of this month, the municipal government is busy preparing for the takeover. Mayor Wu of the municipal government, because the damage to the Zhabei area is extremely severe, has already organized a rehabilitation committee to carry out a restoration plan after the takeover. However, all public agencies and buildings in the war zone related to the city's appearance urgently need to be organized and improved as soon as possible. Therefore, he ordered Cai Zengji, the director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, to immediately raise 500,000 gold to be used for organizing the Zhabei area. After receiving the order, Director Cai contacted the municipal bank to negotiate a loan, which has already been arranged.</p>
<h3>Harmonizing the Meaning of the Copies</h3>
<p>▲ Both Sides Awaiting Instructions to Decide</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that both sides had no contact yesterday regarding the meaning of the words in the Chinese-Japanese armistice agreement. Both sides are waiting for instructions to resolve the issue. Regarding the two unresolved points in the Japanese text, (nearby) and (should be divided into four), Okazaki, the Japanese secretary in charge of this matter, stated yesterday that if the Chinese side agrees not to modify the two points (nearby) and (should be divided into four), then Japan can also waive the requirement to modify the eight minor issues in the Chinese text. When asked why eight points were found after the Chinese text had been completely resolved, Okazaki replied that these were another eight points. When the reporter inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was said that there was no such thing and that the meaning of the words in the Chinese text had been completely resolved. It is unknown whether the eight points that Okazaki mentioned as conditions for exchange are new demands or a rehash of the resolved issues. The intentions of the Japanese are truly unpredictable. A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 13th reports that the Chinese and Japanese copies of the Shanghai armistice agreement will likely be signed on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Opposition to the Armistice Agreement</h3>
<p>University Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</p>
<p>▲ Shifting the Sound of Cannons to the Northeast</p>
<p>▲ The Government is Knowingly Deceiving the People</p>
<p>To the judgment of all citizens of the country:</p>
<p>The armistice agreement benefits the enemy. Internally, it is sufficient to alleviate the economic crisis. Externally, it is sufficient to ease the international criticism. On a small scale, it can wash away the shame of defeat on the shores of Shanghai. On a large scale, it can solidify the momentum of expansion in the Far East. Therefore, even a sickbed cannot prevent its signing. Tokyo's public opinion even celebrates the success of diplomacy. Examining what our side has gained, besides the government sacrificing sovereignty as a gift to the countries enjoying special interests in the concessions, and the temporary sense of complacency gained by a very small number of shortsighted people in the government and the public, what else is there? Therefore, we believe that the content of the agreement can be ignored. Just based on the armistice agreement itself, making peace with Japan is undeniably humiliating and surrendering national rights. Moreover, although the sound of cannons in Wusong and Zhabei has subsided, it has only been shifted to the distance. The rumbling is still within our national borders. The rivers and mountains are not separated, and the blood is still fresh. To call it an armistice is something that other countries can use to deceive us, but we, the people of our country, cannot bear to deceive ourselves. We still remember that two months ago, various groups in Shanghai telegraphed the government to send troops to the Northeast to prevent Japan from dividing its troops to the south. The calls have not faded, and yet the government allows Japan to seize this good opportunity for an armistice to concentrate its forces in the Northeast. Is this not heartbreaking? Furthermore, Shanghai is the only import port in the East. If the society has no solution to the economy, then the continuous import of Japanese goods is no different from directly or indirectly giving money to help Japan increase its troops in the Northeast. Although the government has repeatedly stated that the Shanghai matter is one part of the entire Sino-Japanese issue, and the Northeast issue will not be stopped because of this, the facts are such that everyone knows it. What power does the government have to cover it up? In this era, no matter what country's government or what actions, they all contain a world nature and cannot be independent of international politics. How can our country be an exception? Moreover, this Japanese invasion of our country is related to the distribution of interests in the Far East, which is extremely complicated. The four powers of Britain, America, France, and Italy participated in the armistice conference, and our country was almost completely passive. The government still claims that there is no political nature. It is not known that Japan is promoting a round table conference and will hold our government responsible based on this agreement. Therefore, the government knows this and is deceiving our people. If it really doesn't know, then the government is昏. Alas, the government is finished. How will our people save themselves? We are responsible for educating and saving the country. We will never recognize this armistice agreement of May 5 as long as we have a breath. We will vow to work hard with the people to the end in anti-Japanese work. Lying on firewood and tasting gall, our determination will not change. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Citizens' United Association</h3>
<p>▲ The Day the Premier Assumed the Extraordinary Presidency</p>
<p>▲ The Government Signed a Humiliating Agreement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' United Association issued a declaration yesterday against the shameful and humiliating armistice agreement, stating: After examining the National Government's declaration to the people that it would never sign any treaty until the Japanese army withdrew, and after relocating the capital from Nanjing to Luoyang, and planning to establish a secondary capital in Xi'an, to show the people that it would resist for a long time to avoid signing a treaty, it now, on May 5, the day commemorating the Premier's assumption of the Extraordinary Presidency, and while the Japanese army is rampant in the three eastern provinces and occupies Shangbao Jiatai, signed an armistice agreement with Japan. How can this not be considered a disgrace to the country? Restricting the movement of our country's troops, allowing the Japanese army to temporarily station in the four districts of Wusong Jiangwan Yinxing Zhabei, and allowing them to be stationed indefinitely in the Public Concession and its Hongkou extraterritorial road construction area. This agreement opens the way for the Japanese army to be the first to be recognized by our country to station troops, which has never been done since the Treaty of Xin Chou. This is particularly declared for your information. Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association, May 13, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Federation of Various Organizations in Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Please pay attention to two points from the national people</p>
<p>▲ There are already three aspects of losing power and humiliating the country</p>
<p>▲ There are also two Shanghai organizations that are most affected. Yesterday, the National Salvation Federation of the Anti-Japanese War Council of the United States received a telegram from the preparatory office of the National Salvation Federation of various groups in Beiping, stating: After examining the declaration of the National Government that it would never sign any treaty until the Japanese army withdrew, and after relocating the capital from Nanjing to Luoyang, and planning to establish a secondary capital in Xi'an, to show the people that it would resist for a long time to avoid signing a treaty, it now, on May 5, the day commemorating the Premier's assumption of the Extraordinary Presidency, and while the Japanese army is rampant in the three eastern provinces and occupies Shangbao Jiatai, signed an armistice agreement with Japan. How can this not be considered a disgrace to the country? Restricting the movement of our country's troops, allowing the Japanese army to be stationed temporarily in the Public Concession and its Hongkou extraterritorial road construction area, is opening a precedent for the Japanese army to be the first to be recognized by our country to station troops, which has never been done since the Treaty of Xin Chou. This is particularly declared for your information. Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association, May 13, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Federation of Various Organizations in Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Please pay attention to two points from the national people</p>
<p>▲ There are already three aspects of losing power and humiliating the country</p>
<p>▲ There are also two Shanghai organizations that are most affected</p>
<p>The National Salvation Federation of various groups in Shanghai received a telegram yesterday from the preparatory office of the National Salvation Federation of various groups in Beiping, stating: The enemy troops are in our territory, and there will be no negotiations. The Shanghai affair will never be resolved alone. These two major principles have been repeatedly stated by the government. Now, the armistice negotiations in Shanghai, regardless of the conditions, should not be opened in the first place, which is to lose the country's prestige. This is the first point that the Association should ask all citizens of the country to pay attention to. In the Yangtze River Basin, the combat, terrain, popular sentiment, and military are all beneficial to us and harmful to the enemy. The repeated victories in the Shanghai war are clear evidence. If the government provides a little assistance and does not make the military strength gap too great, then the enemy troops have no chance of victory. It is that this armistice is something we should not easily allow, and the enemy cannot ask for it. However, we have made many concessions, and the enemy has deliberately made demands. If we win repeatedly, we will not be given relief. If we suffer a little setback, we will urgently seek an armistice. What is the government's mentality? This is the second point that the Association should ask all citizens of the country to pay attention to. As for the content of the agreement, judging only from the disclosed Chinese text, there have been many aspects of losing power and humiliating the country. The national army has no freedom of movement within the territory, one. The enemy troops have no complete withdrawal deadline, two. In the area where the enemy troops withdraw, special police are established, which have the disadvantages of infringing on sovereignty, three. Upon careful review of the provisions, we have nothing to gain, and what we have suffered the most is: one, the army's advance is restricted, and two, all hostile acts are restricted. These two points are what the enemy is most afraid of, and we have clearly stipulated to provide guarantees and invited the nations to provide evidence. Such suicide, if only afraid that the country will perish quickly. Alas, in peacetime, we shouted to overthrow imperialism, but now we oppose resistance. In peacetime, we chanted to abolish unequal treaties, but now we add more bondage. When there is nothing to do, we provoke enemies with big talk. When something happens, we flatter the enemy and deceive the people. With such a government, will we have the sincerity to recover the territory that has been lost in the future, and will we have the ability to preserve the territory that has not been lost? This is the third point that the Association should ask all citizens of the country to pay attention to. Now that the agreement has not yet been exchanged, if our 400 million compatriots do not want to follow the officials of the fallen country and be the people of the fallen country, they should rise up and pursue them without hesitation, regardless of any sacrifice, to effectively oppose it. The Association will first call out and respectfully hear your teachings. External Spokesman</p>
<h3>Talking About the Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>▲ If the Eastern Provinces Issue is Included in the Discussion</p>
<p>▲ The United States May Consider, Otherwise Reject</p>
<p>The Japanese side has been trying its best to promote the holding of a round table conference recently and has sent Tashiro as a committee member on the army side. Since we already have a clear indication, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated yesterday that there is no understanding of holding a round table conference at all in the armistice conference. If the Japanese side must hold it and can include the issue of the three eastern provinces in the discussion, then our side may consider it, otherwise, we will resolutely reject it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Withdraws in Succession</h3>
<p>▲ The Navy Continues to Withdraw</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Commander Nomura issued an order yesterday, ordering the Japanese naval landing force soldiers north of the railway to implement the withdrawal to the concession starting on the 16th. Also, because there are still many Japanese naval landing forces left in Shanghai, it was decided to transfer a part back to the country. It has been decided to send two special service ships to Shanghai starting on the 18th to load more than 1,000 landing forces back to Sasebo. 1,200 people will be left in Shanghai. At that time, four ships from the third fleet will also be transferred back to the country.</p>
<p>▲ Special Soldiers Went to Dalian</p>
<p>The infantry of the Japanese 14th Division has already been transferred to the Eastern Provinces. There are still various teams of artillery, engineering, and communications and sanitation troops that have not yet departed. Yesterday morning, they all took the transport ships sent by the Ministry of the Army at the Wusong and Zhanghuabang docks and left Wusong at 10:00 am to go directly to Dalian and then to the Northeast. 前线</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Withdrawal Process</h3>
<p>▲ More than 20,000 personnel were withdrawn from various locations</p>
<p>▲ We have dispatched armed police to take over the defense</p>
<p>▲ The 19th Route Army guards the Jingkun Railway Line</p>
<p>▲ Trenches and tunnels are available for sightseeing</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement was signed in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, the war clouds that had once permeated the area suddenly turned into a peaceful scene. Because the Japanese side repeatedly stated at the time of signing that they would begin withdrawing troops immediately to show respect for the agreement, the reporter set off from Kunshan on the morning of the 6th to inquire about the Japanese army's movements along our army's front line. It was learned that the first Japanese soldiers to withdraw were from the Fuqiao area, about 800 people, who retreated to Liuhe and Taicang County on April 23. After learning of this, the volunteer army organized by various groups in Taicang County sent a team to take over the defense on April 24. The second was Loutang, with a total of more than 80 soldiers, who withdrew to Jiading at 3:00 am on May 5. On the same day, Xintang City, Luduqiao, Yuewang City, and Chenjiaqiao continued to withdraw, totaling more than 10,000 people, and also concentrated in Jiading. They withdrew completely from the 5th to the 8th. From the 9th, they retreated from Jiading to Luodian and Yangxing. By the 10th, all the Japanese troops concentrated in Jiading had been completely withdrawn. More than 1,000 Japanese soldiers in Pailou City began to withdraw to Liuhe on the 7th, and retreated to Luodian, Waigang, Fangtai, Fengjiabang, Huangdu, and other places on the 8th. In total, about 7 each name, starting on the 6th, withdrew to the Nanxiang area, and retreated completely by the afternoon of the 9th. From the 10th, they retreated to Dachang and Yinxing. At this point, the Japanese army on the front of our railway and north of the railway was considered to have withdrawn completely. Because of the importance of local security, the Jiangsu Provincial Government dispatched 300 armed police officers from the security team on the morning of the 8th and sent them by special train to Kunshan, where 200 were sent to Taicang overnight, and then to Xintang City, Pailou City, Luduqiao, Yuewang City, and other places to take over the defense. On the night of the 9th, another 400 armed police officers from the Capital Police Brigade arrived in Kunshan from Nanjing. 200 of them were assigned to Jiading, Waigang, Fangtai, Fengjiabang, and other places on the 10th. Anting was originally the line of sentries on both sides, and there were no troops stationed there, so the security team went to take over on the night of the 8th. In Huangdu, our armed police went to take over the defense until the 10th. After the Japanese army withdrew from all the places, it can be said that there was no complete land. The landmines buried by the Japanese army and the trenches dug were all destroyed when they were about to withdraw. The Qingyanggang Railway Bridge was urgently ordered by the Road Bureau to be repaired by the engineers on the morning of the 8th, and one-third of the project had been completed by the 9th. A test train was run on the bridge once on the 11th. After the bridge project at Lujiabang is consolidated, it is said that the engineering train will be test-run from Kunshan to Nanxiang first. It is scheduled to be completed on the 15th, and the traffic will be opened around the 20th. As for the railway guard between Kunshan and Nanjing, it is still undertaken by the 19th Route Army. The Nanjing Zhenjiang area is defended by Mao Weishou's troops of the 61st Division, and the division headquarters is located in Nanjing. Danyang to Hushu Pass is undertaken by Qu Shounian's troops of the 78th Division, and the division headquarters is located in Wuxi or Changzhou. Weiting, Wai　　, Zheng　, Kunshan, Dacang, and other areas are defended by Shen Guanghan's troops of the 60th Division, and the division headquarters will be located in Kunshan. The general headquarters of the 19th Route Army decided to move to Suzhou. Zhang Zhizhong's troops of the 5th Army, except for the 88th Division, which has been ordered to be transferred to Wuhan, are still stationed in the Changshu area. Xu Tingyao's troops of the 4th Division, originally stationed in Zhenjiang, have also been ordered to transfer to Jiangxi to suppress bandits. Now, along the Changshu to Suzhou area, the troops are building lanes along the car, and the Kunshan Suzhou Min will be completed soon. The construction between Changshu and Wuxi is also more than half completed, and it is said that the Suzhou Jiaxing will also be built with the 9th Division Jiang Dingwen's troops to build a direct road. All the residents of the cities have mostly moved back, and the market has also returned to its former appearance. On the walls of Suzhou and Changshu, the trenches and tunnels dug before the war are very magnificent, especially the one built by the 5th Army in Changshu is beautiful and exquisite. The trenches built along the Qingyanggang River can directly reach the east gate of Taicang. Behind it, there are bunkers that can accommodate a brigade of soldiers, and the transport trenches directly reach the rear station. In total, there are more than ten scattered trenches between Suzhou and Kunshan. Now that the war has passed, all kinds of great equipment can be provided for our people to visit and see.

<h3>Japan Resolves to Withdraw Troops</h3>
<p>▲ It hurts others without benefiting oneself</p>
<p>▲ Only makes the hatred deeper</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 13th reports that the Manchester Guide newspaper's editorial today criticized Japan's decision to withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai within a month, saying that Japan's claim that it was fighting in Shanghai for other countries has aroused the world's hatred, and there is a sense of regret. This war clearly has no purpose. What benefits did it get? Japan sacrificed huge amounts of money, making tens of thousands of Chinese people homeless, countless houses were destroyed, and it carried out various inhumane acts. All of this made the hatred between China and Japan deeper and made the eventful world aware of the hidden causes of the incident. There are still other places.</p>
<h3>Continued Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Fearing their government would not thoroughly implement imperialism ▲The entire Japanese community in Shanghai, fearing their government would not thoroughly implement imperialism, and dissatisfied that the dream of a Shanghai free city had not been realized, vehemently opposed the withdrawal of Japanese troops invading Shanghai. They convened a meeting at the Japanese Club at 69 Wen Jian Shi Road to discuss countermeasures. The results of the afternoon meeting on the 12th were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, after the meeting concluded, the Japanese attendees publicly elected nine people – 田邊, 船津, 吉田, 堀, 倉知, 安井, 池田, 深町, and 吉住 – to draft two telegrams. One telegram was addressed to the government authorities, sent at 7:30 PM that afternoon, totaling over 300 characters. Its content requested the revocation of the order to withdraw the invading Japanese troops within one month and demanded the use of force to guarantee the establishment of a free city in Shanghai to expand the residential area for the Japanese community. The other telegram was sent to Prime Minister Inukai, the Minister of the Army, the Minister of the Navy, Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in, Chief of the Naval General Staff Prince Fushimi, and the presidents of both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties. This telegram was very long, over a thousand characters, all phrased as questions. It was not submitted until around midnight. Its content can be roughly divided into: (1) If this invasion of Shanghai results in no rights for us (Japanese self-reference), who will compensate for the losses of this operation? (2) Since there was a grand purpose before the invasion, it should be carried through to the end to demonstrate the majesty of our Great Japanese Empire. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' one-month deadline for the withdrawal of invading troops will be opposed by the entire Japanese community in Shanghai. (4) If our Great Japanese Empire does not take advantage of this victory to demand the establishment of a free city in Shanghai from the Chinese government, there will never be another opportunity, and our compatriots in Shanghai will never be able to expand their residential area. Both telegrams were sent in the name of the entire Japanese community in Shanghai. At the same time, five representatives were dispatched to petition Commander of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force, Commander of the Third Fleet, Minister to China Shigemitsu Aoi, Consul-General in Shanghai Matsui, etc., demanding a clear expression of unified action with the Japanese community in Shanghai, urging the government to revoke the troop withdrawal order, and achieving the goal of establishing a free city. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, the Japanese community in Shanghai held another secret meeting at 69 Wen Jian Shi Road. In addition to reporting on the progress of the resolutions from the 12th's meeting, they discussed further measures. It had not concluded by 6:30 PM, so the results were still difficult to ascertain.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Assault and Insult German Doctor</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Consulate Refuses to Accept Case The "North-China Daily News" reports that Dr. Puxai, a German eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist, was traveling by public bus to visit a patient on 狄思威 Road. While passing North Sichuan Road, his intense coughing caused a Japanese soldier sitting across from him to express displeasure. Upon arriving at the intersection of 狄思威 Road, another Japanese man on the bus saw two hundred Japanese marines marching past and immediately disembarked to report. The Japanese soldiers then surrounded the bus, forced Dr. Puxai to get off, and took him to the Marine Corps headquarters before allowing the bus to proceed. Afterwards, Dr. Puxai, before entering the headquarters, gave a coolie one dollar, asking him to report the incident to the police. The Western constable from the 狄思威 Road police station then went to the headquarters to negotiate his release. According to Dr. Puxai, he was punched several times in the head and body inside the headquarters for refusing to remove his hat and answer questions. Afterwards, Dr. Puxai went to the Japanese Consulate to protest, but the consulate staff refused to accept the case.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Statement</h3>
<p>▲No Speeches Given in the Northeast Zhang Xianglin, the chief of general affairs of the Chinese delegation accompanying the League of Nations investigation team to the north, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday on the Gonghe Wheel. According to him, the investigation team will complete its work in the Northeast in another half month. Many reports about the situation of our country's delegation in the Northeast have appeared in various newspapers. However, all speeches and writings by the members who accompanied the delegation and returned to Shenyang first, regardless of the form, are their individual opinions or feelings and they are solely responsible for them. They have nothing to do with Representative Gu and the delegation. According to a telegram Zhang received from Representative Gu through the Beijing office yesterday, Representative Gu has not given any speeches or published any writings since leaving the customs. Representative Gu's report will be formally submitted to the government after his return, and the government will decide when to announce it. As Zhang has been assigned to work in Shanghai and also holds a position at the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, he will not leave Shanghai for the time being.</p>

<p>League of Nations Special Committee</p>
<h3>Reports on the Current Situation in China and Japan</h3>
<p>Before Receiving Report from Investigation Team No Need to Study Situation in Eastern Provinces (Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly's 19-nation special committee issued a report stating that the resolution to ensure a real ceasefire in Shanghai and the withdrawal of Japanese troops is being implemented and appears to guarantee the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops in the short term. As for the three eastern provinces, the special committee stated that there is no need to study the situation in the eastern provinces before receiving the report from the League of Nations investigation team. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th) (Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, at the request of the Chairman of the 19-nation Committee, submitted the report stipulated in Article 7, Paragraph 3 of the March 11 resolution to the members of the League of Nations Assembly. The report only discusses the Manchuria problem. In fact, the International Secretary-General simply took the preliminary report of the Lytton Investigation Team, which was published in early May, and added some formal commentary before forwarding it to the members of the Assembly. The report briefly states the current situation as follows: (Regarding the situation in Shanghai, the 19-nation Committee believes that the resolution on the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Japanese troops is being implemented, and the agreement reached through on-site negotiations based on the Assembly's recommendation appears sufficient to guarantee the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops in the short term. As for the Manchuria problem, the 19-nation Committee believes that it cannot begin studying the matter until the Executive Yuan submits the report created by the investigation team, along with the Executive Yuan's opinion, to the Committee.)

<p>Question of Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Public Bulletin Criticizes Luo Wengan's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Moscow) 因士凡斯太 of the Soviet Union's government bulletin criticized the Nanjing government's attitude toward the resumption of diplomatic relations in today's editorial because the Chinese Foreign Minister Luo Wengan expressed his opinion on the question of the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations when he met with reporters on the 7th of this month. He said that the reasons for hindering the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, as stated by the Foreign Minister of Nanjing, are intended to deceive the Chinese people about the true reasons why the Chinese government and the Soviet Union are still in a hostile position. According to the Nanjing Foreign Minister, the Soviet Union government lacked courtesy toward the Chinese representative attending the Sino-Soviet meeting in Moscow, but it should be known that the Chinese representative Mo Dehui went to Germany several months ago, and there is no Chinese representative here now. The newspaper continued, the Chinese representative left here to go elsewhere because of the order of the Nanjing government, because Foreign Minister Luo issued instructions several months ago to dissolve the Chinese delegation here. The Nanjing government has never proposed to make any negotiations with the Soviet government, so the former should bear all the responsibility for no relationship occurring between the governments of the two countries. Regarding other reasons given by Foreign Minister Luo hindering the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, especially the false accusation that the Soviet Union intends to have dealings with the puppet state of Manchuria, the newspaper also believes that it is intended to deceive the Chinese people, to conceal the true reason why the Nanjing government is unwilling to raise the question of resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. It is said that if the Chinese government will not resume diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union has some simple contact with the Manchurian government, the Nanjing government should have severed all relations with Japan long ago. In fact, the Nanjing government itself is hindering this question of resumption of diplomatic relations, because it cannot solve this problem alone. The newspaper concludes that the severance of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union was initiated by the Nanjing government, and since then, the governments of the two countries have had no relationship. The Nanjing government should bear all the responsibility for this situation and its resulting consequences, and to this day it has not attempted to change its policy. (TASS Agency dispatch of the 13th) (Moscow) Today, Russian officials deny that the Soviet Union is gradually seeking to get closer to the puppet state of Manchuria, saying that the news spread by Nanjing has no basis.

<p>A Sensation Across America</p>
<h3>The Kidnapping of the Lindbergh Baby</h3>
<p>Huge Sums Expended, but the Little Life Ultimately Not Saved Remains Discovered in the Depths of the Forest Skull Shattered, Piercing the Mother's Heart</p>
<h3>A Page in the History of American Social Evil</h3>
<p>▲The Kuomin News Agency's report from Hopewell on the 12th states that the kidnapping case of the Lindbergh baby, which has shaken the entire United States, has now confirmed that the Lindbergh baby was killed by the kidnappers long ago. His remains were discovered today in the forests of Sourland Mountain, not far from the Lindbergh residence. The body was lying face down, with a one-inch hole on the right side of his forehead. Judging from the circumstances, it appears that he was killed shortly after being kidnapped on the night of March 1. It is almost certain that the kidnappers tore up the ticket when Lindbergh delivered the $50,000 ransom in the middle of last month, which is why the kidnappers were unable to return the child. Today, a reporter from the Associated Press was the first to be informed by a servant of Lindbergh's in-laws that the child's body had been found in the mountains. Subsequently, New Jersey Governor Moore also announced that, according to the sheriff's report, the Lindbergh baby's body had been found, but the details were not yet released. Finally, correspondents from various newspapers were invited to the Lindbergh residence and led into a garage, instructed to wait and not allowed to leave. After a long time, the sheriff formally announced the entire story of the discovery of the child's body. Today, a black truck driver named Allen, driving with Wilson, was driving between Princeton and Hopewell when, about four and a half miles from the Lindbergh residence, near the small village of Rose Peak, he stopped his car due to an incident. Allen got out of the car and walked into the forest, and suddenly saw a child's skeleton. He immediately reported it to the police. When the police arrived and removed the child's remains, Lindbergh personally identified the shirt he was wearing as that of the kidnapped baby. A coroner has now been summoned to examine the body, and the results of the examination are expected to be released around 9:00 tonight. It is said that the place where the child's body was placed was in a depression, and covered by the outside of the forest, so it could not be seen unless within a few feet, so the nationwide search for more than two months has only just been discovered. It is reported that the New Jersey state government has spent more than 50,000 yuan to search for this infant, who had only been born for twenty months. The Columbia Broadcasting Radio Station has also spent 40,000 yuan to send and receive news, and the Lindbergh family has spent even more than that. As for indirect losses, such as the cost of newspapers and news agencies to investigate news, the numbers are also not small.  ▲Reuters report from Hopewell on the 12th: After the body of the Lindbergh child was found, an autopsy was performed. According to the doctor's opinion, the child died from a fractured skull, but there were no bullets in the skull. It was found that 75 feet from where the child's body was located, a temporary telephone line had been installed by the telephone bureau after the Lindbergh child was kidnapped for the purpose of searching. The left side of the child's skull was fractured, with a crack running from the top to behind the left ear. There was also a hole on the right side, just behind the right ear, about half an inch in diameter. Judging from the circumstances, it seems that an adult tightly held the child in his arms and deliberately hammered the child's head to kill him instantly. However, another view is that the child was thrown from a car and died from a fractured skull. Upon closer inspection of the skeleton, it has been proven that this child was tragically killed not long after being kidnapped. The structure of his teeth, skull, and other bones has proven definitively that it is Lindbergh's child. The first person to discover the child's body was a black man named Allen, who called a white man named Wilson to come and see, and then rushed to the police station to report. Colonel Lindbergh is rushing back to Hopewell after receiving the news. According to Lindbergh's close friends, Mrs. Lindbergh was extremely shocked to hear the bad news, but she is trying her best to suppress her grief. Kuomin News Agency report from Hopewell on the 12th: After being examined by doctors, Colonel Lindbergh's child was proven to have been killed shortly after being kidnapped on March 1. The United States is now in an uproar over the tragic end to this case, and public opinion is extremely indignant, considering it the most vile page in the history of crime in the United States. Furthermore, the 50,000 yuan that Lindbergh previously paid to the kidnappers or those impersonating kidnappers (all 5, 10, and 20 yuan banknotes) had been notified to various banks by the Ministry of Finance in advance for investigation, and major newspapers had also published all the numbers, accounting for as much as 18% of the newspaper's space. Although several of them have been presented for redemption, the pursuit has not yet been successful. Furthermore, three newspapers had offered a reward of 50,000 to seek the safe return of the Lindbergh child. These funds may now be diverted to the task of arresting the kidnappers.  ▲Kuomin News Agency report from Princeton on the 12th: It has just been reported by a rural doctor that Miss Gao, the Lindbergh baby's nanny, was not satisfied with her identification of the child's remains, so she requested that the corpse examination form be filled in with "infant of unknown name", but if the Lindberghs believe it is their child, she will sign a "Lindbergh child corpse form". Currently, the Lindberghs have not personally seen the remains, Lindbergh only saw a shirt and confirmed that it was worn by his child.  ▲Reuters report from Trenton, New Jersey, on the 13th: The body of the Lindbergh child has been identified as the child's remains by several doctors who were present at his birth and by the nanny who recognized special marks on his body. According to the doctors, the child was murdered almost immediately after being kidnapped. The authorities are currently investigating those who negotiated the ransom with the bandits.

<h3>Staging Unprecedented Physical Drama</h3>
<p>National Socialist Party Members Get Violent Police Enter Parliament to Arrest People ▲Kuomin News Agency report from Berlin on the 12th: Today, after the German Parliament rejected a motion of no confidence in the government by a majority of thirty votes, it adjourned amidst an unprecedented riot in the history of the German parliament. Previously, Colonel Crozz, a retired naval officer, formerly affiliated with the National Socialist Party, was well aware of the party's content. During the election campaign, he wrote a pamphlet attacking the party and accusing the party leader Hitler's Chief of Staff, Colonel Roehm, of immoral behavior. Therefore, the party members hated him to the core. Today, Fang and several members of the Socialist Party were drinking in the Parliament's refreshment room when the bell rang in the parliament, notifying them to vote on the motion. The Socialist Party members returned to the parliament to vote. Five members of the National Socialist Party took the opportunity to beat Fang violently until he fell to the ground unconscious before dispersing. Afterwards, someone immediately reported to Speaker Robert, who ordered two parliament staff members to support Fang through the various rest rooms to identify the perpetrators. Unexpectedly, Fang was again violently beaten by members of the National Socialist Party. As a result, the entire parliament was outraged by the actions of the National Socialist Party and almost broke out into a full-scale brawl. Fortunately, the Speaker immediately announced a two-hour adjournment. After reconvening, Robert announced that he had delegated all his powers to maintain order in the parliament to the police authorities. Robert then read out the names of the National Socialist Party members who beat Colonel Fang Crozz, and said that they had been suspended from attending for thirty days and should immediately leave the meeting place. However, the five party members ignored him. The parliament then adjourned again for fifteen minutes. When the meeting reconvened, the five party members were still sitting in their seats. Robert had no choice but to announce an indefinite adjournment. Within minutes, Deputy Police Chief Weisbo led a large contingent of police to surround the seats of the National Socialist Party. Other police arrested several members of the party. Fortunately, the main members of the party explained to Weis that those arrested were not the ones who beat people, and asked them to release them. He ordered those who beat people to turn themselves in to the police station nearby. Therefore, Weis retreated. It is reported that the five party members who beat people have gone to the police station to surrender. Although the arrested party members enjoy special parliamentary privileges, they will not be pardoned this time and will still be sent to court tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Clash Between Two Extremist Factions</h3>
<p>▲Havas report from Berlin on the 13th: Last night, a clash occurred between the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party in Berlin, with gunfire exchanged. Two members of the National Socialist Party were killed and four were seriously injured. In the Lichtenberg area, when the Hitler Party held a general meeting, the Communist Party went to disrupt it and opened fire, killing an old man and seriously injuring four others.</p>
<h3>Minister of National Defense Resigns</h3>
<p>▲Havas report from Berlin on the 12th: General Groener, the German Minister of Interior and National Defense, has recently resigned from his position as Minister of National Defense and will only serve as Minister of Interior.  ▲Another telegram states that Admiral Raeder has recently been appointed as the German Minister of National Defense.</p>
<p>▲Havas report from Berlin on the 12th: General Groener's resignation as Minister of National Defense is one of the most important events in German politics. It will have a profound impact on the future of German domestic politics. This shows that German politics are becoming increasingly right-leaning, and today's events are the first result of the trend in the organization of the federal cabinet resulting from the Prussian elections on March 24. The reason why Groener should resign is that he is the most left-wing member of the cabinet and had insisted on disbanding Hitler's stormtroopers. Japan Plans to Borrow Money from France</p>

Japanese Police Arbitrarily Arrest Overseas Chinese</p>
<h3>The Reason Being the Translation and Printing of Booklets</h3>
<p>Alleged to Have Damaged the Empire's Military Interests ▲Japanese News Agency report from Tokyo on the 13th: Since mid-March, small magazines titled "The Truth About the Manchurian Incident" have been secretly distributed in various parts of Tokyo, the contents of which severely criticized the actions of the Japanese military. The Metropolitan Police Department's Foreign Affairs Section has been investigating the truth day and night, intending to arrest the perpetrators. It seems that they have found clues a few days ago. As of last night, Kikuchi Uji (48 years old), a ronin from Magome-cho, outside Tokyo City, Zhang Qingjian (36 years old), a Chinese Christian Youth Association executive from Kitajimbo-cho, Kanda Ward, Gu Hongnian (27 years old), a Chinese student in the Department of Political Economy at Waseda University, and He Hongyuan (32 years old), a Chinese Army Lieutenant Colonel and Chairman of the Northeast Army Officers' Committee from Benten-cho, Ushigome Ward, were arrested separately and escorted to police stations in the city, where they are being investigated by Chief Inspector Maehara and others.

<h3>Joins the International Court of Justice</h3>
<p>▲Reuters report from Washington on the 12th: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah today reported to the Senate that he approved the amendments supporting the United States' joining the World Court. It seems that the United States is preparing to join. The United States has been hesitant to join the World Court for nine years, and three presidents have advocated that the Senate conditionally approve the articles of the World Court during these nine years. The reservations agreed upon by the United States stipulate that the court may not accept requests to handle any dispute or issue related to the interests of the United States without the express consent of the United States, and that all related countries must formally recognize the reservations of the United States, before the United States can join. Borah has strongly opposed the United States joining the World Court. There are currently 54 countries that have joined the World Court, and only 9 countries have not joined: Argentina, Mexico, Honduras, Afghanistan, Ecuador, Egypt, Soviet Russia, and the United States.</p>

<h3>Danger in Franco-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>▲Because of the Assassination of President Doumer ▲Fear of Causing a Second World War The Osaka Asahi Shimbun recently published a lengthy article entitled (Fear that the Rupture of Franco-Russian Diplomatic Relations will Lead to a Second World War). The article stated that after the assassination of French President Doumer, the perpetrator confessed that he greatly admired Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German National Socialist leader Hitler. The perpetrator seemed to be a white radical. However, before Doumer, other French presidents had been assassinated, such as Carnot on June 24, 1894, who was killed by the anarchist Caserio during an official luncheon in Lyon. This caused a national uproar in France. This time, the perpetrator who assassinated Doumer was Russian. According to the announcement by the French government, the perpetrator was not a White Russian exile, but a former Communist Party member. Therefore, Prime Minister Tardieu and other key figures have been holding secret meetings for days, and the situation is extremely tense. Moreover, Russia and France are already incompatible in terms of doctrine and policy. Recently, the two countries signed a non-aggression pact to prevent conflict, but unexpectedly, this major incident suddenly occurred. The effectiveness of that treaty is bound to vanish. In addition, the Soviet Union openly advocates revising the Treaty of Versailles for Germany and also holds the same sympathy. Germany again wants to connect with Italy to develop the European political situation. On the other hand, France firmly insists on its views regarding war debt reparations. Therefore, the two countries are already in an irreconcilable situation. Recalling the assassination of the Austrian Crown Prince in Sarajevo in 1914, which caused a great disaster, now with the assassination of Doumer as the fuse, whether Europe in 1932 will re-enact a second world war is difficult to say. However, in recent days, anti-Russian sentiment has permeated France, and the hidden danger in the future is truly unimaginable. Tanaka's Inspection of Manchuria Afterwards</p>
<h3>Advocating Friendship with Russia</h3>
<p>▲Also Emphasizing the Non-Aggression Treaty The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported that former Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Tanaka Tokichi, had been ordered to inspect Manchuria for a period of one and a half months. Now that his mission has ended, he returned to Beijing on the 8th to report on his mission. In the train, he expressed his views on Manchuria, stating that the Manchurian army is insufficient for defense, and Japan should also increase its troops as soon as possible. In the future, Japan should pay attention to Manchuria not only in economic terms but also in terms of national defense. Currently, many Manchurian officials are Japanese, which is indeed appropriate. However, the reform of the Manchurian institutions should urgently abolish the "four-headed politics" at this time, establish a unified organization, and center it on the military department to take on the responsibility of maintaining law and order. Moreover, Russia has a direct relationship with Manchuria and Japan. The policy towards Russia must be very cautious, and the only urgent task is to strive for friendship and cooperation with Russia. The non-aggression treaty previously proposed by Russia should be considered with care. National Humiliation Memorial Meeting</p>
<h3>Report by President Wang</h3>
<p>▲People's Representative Body is Being Actively Prepared ▲The Armistice Agreement Does Not Contain Political Implications ▲Efforts to Resolve the Northeast Issue Will Be Intensified The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters' Office in Nanjing held the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Meeting. President Wang gave an important report, which was briefly noted in the previous report. Now, the original text of Wang's report is supplemented as follows: Comrades, today is Memorial Week and also the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Day. The Central Party Headquarters entrusted me to report to you on the work of this past week. The important work of this past week can be divided into two parts: (1) The proceedings of the discussion regarding the National People's Congress; (2) The proceedings of the Shanghai Armistice and Troop Withdrawal Agreement. Now, I will first report on the proceedings of the discussion regarding the National People's Congress. The proposal for the National People's Congress was raised by several comrades during the First Plenary Session of this year. At that time, there were three proposals: the National Crisis Conference, the National Salvation Conference, and the National People's Congress. The First Plenary Session resolved that the National Crisis Conference should be convened by the National Government, and the National People's Congress and the National Salvation Conference should be discussed by the Standing Committee. Later, when the National Crisis Conference was held, a resolution was sent to the National Government requesting the early establishment of the National People's Congress. Therefore, the Central Political Council, for this issue, went through four detailed discussions, two formal meetings and two discussion sessions. Because this major case is very important, the Central Committee was unwilling to make a hasty decision. A formal meeting was held last Monday, and another discussion session was held on Friday. A formal meeting was held again last Monday, and another discussion session was held on Friday, so that the Central Committee would have sufficient time to discuss and exchange opinions with each other. The result of the first formal meeting was to submit the National People's Congress, the amendment proposed by Comrade Yu Youren, and the proposal for popularly elected half of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan together for review. Everyone discussed during the first discussion session. There were many key points during the discussion. Now I will report to you. One of the so-called key points is the basis. According to the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," the foundation of civil rights should be from the bottom up. Therefore, there is Article 8 of the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" (During the period of political tutelage, the government shall send trained and qualified personnel to assist the people in each county in preparing for self-government, so as to become a fully self-governing county), and then there is Article 14 of the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" (After the establishment of local self-government in each county, one representative of the people may be elected to form a representative assembly to participate in central government affairs). Because the power of the National People's Congress is very important, it must first be established after local self-government is completed. We see that the Premier's "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" has a clear order. If we now establish the National People's Congress before self-government is completed, it would completely violate the procedures stipulated in the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction." This view has a correct reason. But at the same time, there is also a point of view that the Premier taught us a method of adapting to the times, in addition to the clear provisions of the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction." Of course, when the First National Congress of the Kuomintang was held in 1924, the Premier proposed the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction." In September, when the Premier sent troops on the Northern Expedition, he initially promulgated the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" in the name of the government, with a very long preamble attached. However, in November of the same year, when the Premier went north, he advocated convening a National Assembly. The National Assembly is also a kind of public opinion mechanism, which can prove that it is not necessary to wait until the procedures stipulated in the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" are completed before a public opinion mechanism can be established. Both of the above two key points have reasons. Therefore, after much discussion at that time, the result was that a central public opinion mechanism could be established during the period of political tutelage, but its name and powers should be discussed at the next meeting. This result was decided at the second formal meeting last Monday. When the second discussion session was held last Friday, some advocated using the name "National People's Congress," some advocated using the name "National Political Participation Council," and some advocated expanding the popularly elected members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan. According to the opinions of most comrades, it is more appropriate to use the name "National Political Participation Council." The reason is that the establishment of a central public opinion mechanism during the period of political tutelage is, in practice, the same as the National People's Congress. However, local self-government has not been completed. If the words "National People's Congress" are used, it would be inconsistent with the facts. Because according to the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," each county must establish a local self-government before it can elect a member to form the National People's Congress. Now that self-government has not been completed, it is of course not the fault of the government's delay, and the people cannot be blamed. But the lack of self-government is still a fact. Ignoring the facts would inevitably contradict the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" established by the Premier. Therefore, everyone felt that a compromise solution was to establish a central public opinion mechanism, but change the name to "National Political Participation Council," which is consistent with the meaning of the people participating in central government affairs. However, on the one hand, the National Political Participation Council is established, and many popularly elected representatives are elected. On the other hand, the popularly elected members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan are still not abolished, which would become a duplicate public opinion mechanism. Therefore, everyone felt that with the establishment of the National Political Participation Council, the previous proposal for half of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan to be popularly elected could be postponed. This was the view of most comrades at the discussion session last Friday. We are preparing to summarize various opinions and make a detailed decision at the formal meeting to be held at 3:00 PM today. The situation regarding the discussion of the National People's Congress is roughly like this. This matter is a very important matter for our Party at present. To achieve the goal of completing political tutelage and promoting constitutional government, and to cultivate civil rights during the period of political tutelage, depends on the decision of this meeting. The text of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement has been disclosed in the Central Daily News and other newspapers, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs has made a declaration, which is very clear. I believe everyone has seen it. Today, what I want to say is only the two most important points: (1) Whether this agreement contains political implications; (2) Whether this agreement is separate from the Northeast issue. Regarding these two points, I can explain that if this agreement contains political implications, that is, the so-called exchange of Japanese troop withdrawal for political conditions, that would certainly lead to the danger of losing sovereignty and humiliating the country. The government absolutely refuses to do so. Fortunately, this point has been avoided. The content of the agreement does not contain political implications. Regarding the second point, if we only hope to solve the Shanghai issue and shelve the Northeast issue, that would also be a loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country. The government also absolutely refuses to do so. We believe that the Shanghai armistice conference is only a step towards solving the Northeast issue. Some people in Shanghai say that China is a whole, so why is there an armistice and troop withdrawal in Shanghai, but not in the Northeast? It must be known that China has not declared war on Japan. If war is formally declared, of course there will be an armistice and troop withdrawal together. However, this time, the government's policy is to resist on the one hand and negotiate on the other. Therefore, no matter where Japan attacks, we will resist. If Japan stops attacking, we will stop. As long as the armistice and troop withdrawal agreement does not contain political conditions, the Shanghai armistice and troop withdrawal can be carried out simultaneously with the continued resistance in the Northeast. A political meeting must raise the entire issue of China and Japan, especially the fundamental issue, that is, the Northeast issue, for resolution. It is absolutely not the case that the Shanghai issue is resolved and the Northeast issue is ignored. Now that these two key points have been made clear, it can be known that the establishment of this agreement is certainly not a satisfactory success or the final goal, but it is not a contract that loses sovereignty and humiliates the country. As for how to solve the Northeast issue, the government can only proceed with the policy of resisting on the one hand and negotiating on the other. Regarding this point, I have the same feelings as the May 9th National Humiliation. The May 9th National Humiliation has not yet been washed away, and the Northeast issue since September 18th has not yet been resolved. The government will never relax because of the establishment of this agreement, and will intensify its efforts to fight. Military diplomacy is certainly important, but in my personal opinion, domestic affairs are even more important, because diplomacy depends on the military, and the military depends on the economy, culture, and the organization and equipment of various sciences. The economy, culture, and the organization and equipment of various sciences depend on the improvement of domestic affairs. Therefore, if domestic affairs are not improved, the economy, culture, and the organization and equipment of various sciences cannot be carried out, and military diplomacy will never be possible. Since January 28th, I and Comrade Chiang Kai-shek have discussed domestic affairs issues. Although there are various things that should be reformed, due to all aspects of the current situation, we have adopted a gentle policy. Some things, although they should be done, cannot be done. Originally, I could give many examples, but now I will just summarize and say that the policy taken in the past few months has been a gentle policy, hoping that everyone will unite to overcome the national crisis. Although there are dissatisfactions with all aspects, we must always proceed gently. Whether this point is correct or not, please criticize. Is there a contradiction between the gentle policy and the improvement of domestic affairs? Of course there is. But if we take a firm policy, although it can reduce constraints, it can also cause disunity. Therefore, we want to wait until all conditions are met before enriching our strength. This is something that everyone must pay attention to, and please criticize strictly. In short, in the current situation, we dare not relax one step. I once said at the National Crisis Conference that the government has determined a minimum limit for the current difficult situation. Above the minimum limit, we can endure. Below the minimum limit, we must resist. The ultimatum proposed by Japan on February 20th, we absolutely did not accept. The signing of this armistice and troop withdrawal agreement is for this reason. Now that we have signed the Shanghai armistice and troop withdrawal agreement, it is only a step towards solving the Northeast issue. It cannot be said that we have embarked on the road to peace. In the future, we will have to sacrifice and fight. Today is Memorial Week and also the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Day. The situation for more than a decade is still the same. Therefore, our spirit of sacrifice and struggle should be consistent and should be intensified day by day. This is roughly what I am reporting today. The New Work of Suppressing Bandits in Jiangxi Province</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Surrounded by Japanese Reporters on the Haiqi</h3>
<p>It is said that political power assists the army. According to a Nanchang dispatch, the Jiangxi Provincial Bandit Suppression Office has decided on an extremely detailed plan for completely eliminating the Red bandits. The most important point is to use political power to assist the army in suppressing the bandits and to seize the people in the bandit areas. Previously, bandit suppression relied solely on the army and lacked the assistance of political power. Therefore, every time a place was captured, there was no local military force to maintain it. As a result, the tragedy of the bandits returning after the troops left, burning and killing, was repeated. Therefore, the future work of the Security Office is to use local political power to maintain the lost land that has been recaptured, to eliminate the small remnants of bandits in various counties, and to fundamentally eradicate the forces of the Red bandits lurking in the countryside. Since Xiong Shihui, chairman of the provincial government, concurrently served as the director of the office, he has strictly supervised the counties to eliminate the small remnants of the Red bandits, eliminate their so-called county Soviet organizations, and spare no effort. At the same time, he reorganized the Republic of China Baojia police teams, watch teams, and militiamen in various counties, expanded and tightened their organizations, strengthened their forces, and unified their command. In the past two months, there have been initial results. It is said that a general mobilization to eliminate bandits will begin soon. The required firearms and ammunition have also been fully purchased and a minimum price has been set, ordering each county to raise funds for purchase. In addition, various bandit suppression programs have been formulated, such as important plans for transportation construction and rural revitalization, preparing to submit them to the bandit suppression conference for approval and implementation.

<p>▲Tragedy Occurs in the Election of the Party Committee Yesterday morning, the Third District Party Headquarters of Liuzhao Town held a meeting of party members to elect district executive and supervisory committee members. Chen Shixian and Gao Keji, who are related to the district, predicted that there would be disputes in this election. Therefore, they borrowed more than 20 members of the Zhugiao Town Security Regiment in the Second District and armed them to intimidate the scene. When party members Yuan Langqing, Wang Jifeng, and Lu Chengzhang went to question them, a conflict broke out between the two sides.

At that time, due to the large army gathered here, the provincial government ordered the accumulation of supplies, and it was rumored that traitors in the mainland were supplying the enemy with food. Therefore, the office presented it to the county government. With the household ministry and provincial ministry, this had not yet been announced. The merchants presented a county government, stating that these rice grains, were from upper rice merchants and not smuggled. The county government felt it was hard to act without orders from the province. Yesterday, Provincial Commissioner Chen Shilin secretly came to Changshu. He went to and then viewed the files, inquired about the court proceedings, and the 12th to return by wheel to province.

<h3>Xiao's Mother Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Never Forget China's Hospitality ▲Extensively Promote After Returning Home The mother of the martyr Xiao De, Madam Xiao, and her second son, Edmund, boarded a ship from the Xinkuan Wharf yesterday afternoon to return to their country. Those who came to the wharf to see them off included Guo Fu representative Tang Haian, Ministry of Finance representative Zheng Lai, Municipal Government representative Yu Hongjun, Commendation Committee members Hu Yunqiu, Hu Yunzhuang, Mei Qiju, He Yongyun, Chen Boquan, Huang Tanfu, Liang Shichun, Shen Dexie, various groups' National Salvation United Association Yin Zhiling, Municipal Association Hu Feng</p>
<h3>The Grand Farewell of Xiao's Mother by All Circles at Xinkuan Wharf</h3>
<p>(Photo donated by Mr. Jiang Bingnan) Xiang, Road Association Cai Xiaobai, Telegraph Association Yao ShouKang, General Labour Union Chen Peide, and more than 100 representatives from over 90 organizations, as well as dozens of Moor Hall Boy Scouts. The organizations presented flower baskets, including the National Salvation United Association, Commendation Committee, General Labour Union, Telegraph Association, Road Association, National Disaster Relief Association, and more than a dozen others. Madam Xiao arrived at the wharf at 12:00 noon from the Cathay Hotel in the same car as Tang Haian, Madam Li Jinglun, and others. She shook hands with each of the representatives who came to see her off before boarding the ship. The representatives elected Yin Zhiling, Chen Boquan, and Madam Li to escort Madam Xiao to the McKinley mail ship at Bailianjing. Yin Zhiling asked Madam Xiao about her feelings after coming to Shanghai on the ship. Madam Xiao replied, "After I came to Shanghai, I received grand receptions from the Chinese government and various groups in Shanghai, and Xiao De was buried, and received a grand funeral. This not only makes me never forget China's hospitality, but also shows that Chinese society has a very deep respect for those who sacrificed for the anti-Japanese cause. I sincerely hope that more Chinese soldiers and people in the world will be willing to sacrifice their lives like Xiao De, and will receive the same grand respect and hospitality from the Chinese state and society that has been given to me. After I return to my country, I will extensively promote this grand hospitality given to me to my own people. I think that people in my country will definitely be excited when they hear about it, because since the Shandong issue occurred, officials and people in my country have all hated Japan for destroying international conventions, and have been thinking about appropriate methods to resist its atrocities. But I believe that Xiao De's death is the most practical and exciting expression of cooperation between the people of China and the United States to resist Japan." Madam Xiao is in cabin number 46 in first class, and is expected to arrive in the United States in about two weeks. The Japanese Post Office sent a ship to transport the goods.</p>
<h3>Over 50,000 Tons of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>▲Osaka-Kobe Route Restored After the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the Osaka-Kobe-Shanghai and Yokohama-Shanghai routes of the Japanese Post Office were completely suspended. The ships were transferred to Shanghai for military transport. Now, due to the withdrawal of the Japanese army and navy stationed in Shanghai, there are a large number of Japanese goods, more than 50,000 tons, left in the Osaka-Kobe area, which urgently need to be transported to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Japanese Post Office received a telegram from Tokyo, stating that in order to meet the needs of commercial transport, starting tomorrow, the Osaka-Kobe route, which had been suspended for six weeks, would be restored, with the first ship, Rokko Maru, departing. Aso Maru, Ikoma Maru, Kasagi Maru, Maya Maru, and others will also resume their routes.</p>
<h3>Reduced Inland Waterways Ferry Services</h3>
<p>▲Already Under Discussion Shanghai's inland waterway ferry industry experienced a surge in business after the outbreak of the war. The number of temporary ferry routes to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu increased to dozens, with a total of more than 60 ships departing daily, a tenfold increase compared to before. The business was very profitable. Now, due to the withdrawal of the Japanese army and the upcoming opening of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the temporary inland waterway ferry routes are all planning to withdraw and suspend operations. Once the train service resumes, they will return to their original state. Only one ferry each from China Merchants and Yuantong will remain on the Suzhou-Shanghai route, and the rest will cease operations.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Allocates Emergency Relief Funds for Farmers in Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan</h3>
<p>▲A Total of 300,000 Yuan This time, when Japanese soldiers invaded, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan counties all suffered devastation. The number of houses, appliances, and the lives and property of the people destroyed by Japanese soldiers' artillery and bombs is unknown. Fortunately, the local gentry and merchants established disaster relief associations one after another. They found that the farmers suffered the most. Not only were their appliances and seeds lost, but also the capital to engage in farming after the Japanese soldiers withdrew was nowhere to be found. The associations, in view of this, used the names of the Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan County Disaster Relief Associations to petition the provincial government for relief. It is said that the petition has been approved, and 100,000 yuan in cash has been allocated to provide emergency relief to farmers in Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan counties. In addition, Suzhou Province's busy canal mortgage loan vouchers (with a face value of 300,000 yuan) will be used to borrow 200,000 yuan in cash, which will be issued to the disaster relief associations in the three counties to provide relief, so that they can engage in farming.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhi Went to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>

It is known that Ambassador Wilden took the British ship Changsha last night to leave Shanghai for Beijing for official business. He plans to stay in Beijing for one or two days, and will then go north to Ping via the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<h3>The British Boxer Indemnity Committee will hold a meeting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Completing the Yuehan Railway, Managing Students Studying Abroad The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors is scheduled to hold its 7th regular meeting and 9th general meeting in Shanghai on the 16th and 18th. It is reported that the important proposals at this meeting are: (1) The Ministry of Railways requests a loan of £170,000 to complete the Yuehan Railway project; (2) The Ministry of Industry's Central Machinery Plant's £120,000 loan guarantee interest and repayment method; (3) Regulations for handling loan requests. In addition, the association previously received a request for assistance from students studying in the United Kingdom from the three northeastern provinces. The association believed that there were no funds available for the time being. Chairman Zhu Jiahua telegraphed the Chinese Committee of various universities in London to find a way to provide assistance nearby. According to Mr. Hang Liwu, Director-General of the British Boxer Indemnity Committee, the committee has agreed to allocate £500 in advance to lend to the students.</p>
<h3>Canada Sends Commercial Commissioner</h3>
<p>▲Currently Stationed in Hong Kong The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received instructions from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, approving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' consultation that the Canadian government has now dispatched Mr. Victor Eugene Dvclos to be stationed in Hong Kong as a commercial commissioner for Hong Kong and Southern China, performing his duties. In the future, matters concerning Canadian government commercial affairs in Southern China can be contacted with the commissioner.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Righteous Army Sends Representatives to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Report on the Anti-Japanese Course ▲And Ask All Circles for Assistance The 10th Route of the Liaoning Righteous Army is formed by the old troops and militia of various parts of the Northeast. The commander is Wu Chaogang. It currently has more than 20,000 cavalry and infantry. Since the Shenyang Incident, it has repeatedly fought fiercely with the Japanese aggressors and has won considerable victories. However, due to the harsh environment and the lack of supplies and bullets, it has not been able to fight the Japanese army to the death. It is now heard that the route, in view of the various difficulties mentioned above, has specially sent the route's political minister Xu Jinai, deputy officer in charge Wu Zhidong, staff officer Liu Xinyuan, Gu Yu, and Yang Yili to Shanghai to report to all circles on the situation of the war and ask for assistance.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Writes to the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Correcting the New Regulations for Water Supply ▲The Real Estate Association will hold a meeting today to discuss After the British-owned water company in the Public Concession implemented the water meter system, the Real Estate Association opposed collecting and resolving water fees on its behalf. It specifically scheduled a general meeting of members at 3:00 pm today at No. 98 Beijing Road, to discuss the method. The Citizens' United Association, on the other hand, opposes water meters and demands the restoration of the package water system. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday to correct the new regulations of the water company. The original letter stated, "Sir, according to a letter from resident He Lihua, the water company in this concession has revised its new regulations. All users with water meters must use 10,000 gallons or more. For those who use more, it will be added incrementally, and for those who use less, it will be calculated according to 10,000 gallons. The price per thousand gallons is 62.5 cents. This kind of cutting the feet to fit the shoes is not a concern for the rich, but it will inevitably cause great difficulties in the lives of small families. For users who do not use 10,000 gallons, and want to pay the high price of 10,000 gallons, how can they calculate the losses that accumulate over the years? Using water is not as insignificant as the bus ticket price, or you can choose not to take it. Business in the business world relies entirely on fairness. The company's new regulations not only make it difficult for individuals, but also affect the market. I hereby request that you find a way to advocate so that users in the concession can reduce their burden. After the meeting, this matter has a great impact on the living expenses of users in the concession. The bureau should immediately implement the correction of the fair agency.</p>
<h3>The Ninth Health Campaign</h3>
<p>▲Focus on the Grand Cleaning of Zhabei The 15th of this month is the date stipulated by the central government for the national health campaign and grand cleaning. The city's Health Bureau has been planning and holding publicity and implementation of essential methods related to hygiene every year, which has been able to awaken a considerable awareness of public health among citizens. This is the city's ninth health campaign. It is heard that the Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the post-war epidemic, believes that the work of preventing epidemics and cleaning up the filth in the war zone is very important. The bureau has drafted methods and submitted them to the municipal government for review. The municipal government believes that cleaning up the filth in the war zone is the top priority, and has instructed the bureau to instruct this health campaign to focus on the grand cleaning of Zhabei and other war zones. The bureau, after receiving the order, immediately stepped up preparations and is now ready to be held on schedule. Zhabei</p>
<h3>Restoration of Water and Electricity Projects</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company temporarily moved to Ningbo Road during the war. It is now known that it has moved back to its original general office at Arui Lane, North Sichuan Road. All water pipes and electric wires damaged by artillery fire in the Zhabei area, except for those that were completely destroyed and had no residents, have been repaired by engineers and craftsmen since the end of the war. Now, tap water, electricity, and power can be supplied as usual. At the end of last month, the maximum power supply load reached 7,188 kilowatts, while the load in the same month last year was 11,744 kilowatts, which has recovered more than 60%. The daily delivery of tap water is 4 million gallons, which is about 45% of the original supply. Recently, with the signing of the ceasefire agreement, many residents have moved back, and the number of households requesting to connect to water and electricity every day is very large. The company's business prospects will continue to improve.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Reduce and Exempt Rent</h3>
<p>▲A Special Committee Will Be Established Representatives of the Municipal Citizens' Rent Reduction and Exemption Movement Committee, Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Li Yongxiang, and others went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 am yesterday (the 13th) to request Director Mai Chaoshu of the bureau to issue laws and regulations on the issue of rent reduction and exemption in various areas affected by the war, so that the public can follow. As for the concession, no matter the court or the Public Works Department, there will be concrete measures based on government orders, so there will be no problems. According to Director Mai, the bureau had already submitted this case to the municipal government and reviewed the regulations for organizing the committee. It has been instructed to plan for the bureau, but the government is afraid that it will not be able to do so thoroughly, so it is requested that relevant groups also add representatives to jointly organize the establishment of the committee.</p>
<h3>Change the Method of Increasing Postage</h3>
<p>▲Decision to Start from the 20th of This Month The Japanese newspaper, Nichinichi Shimbun, reports: Since the postage increase on the first of this month, the new regulations have been used. People from all walks of life believe that at a time when the social economy is increasingly bankrupt, the government has not provided relief, but has increased the burden on the people, and has been criticized by the masses. In order to comply with public sentiment, the Executive Yuan decided to order the Ministry of Transportation to reduce the increase in the new regulations and handle them in a flexible manner, so that the people would increase slightly without harm, and the postal service could expand by this. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Postal Administration told a Nichinichi Shimbun reporter that the Postal Administration had received an order from the Ministry of Transportation the day before yesterday regarding this change of method, and would begin to implement it from the 20th of this month. After implementation, it will no longer be changed. The various methods are recorded as follows: Add 1 cent in this city (2 cents per letter), change to add 1 cent in other cities (5 cents per letter), add 1 cent for postcards in this city (that is, 2 cents), change to add half a cent for postcards in other cities (2.5 cents), express mail (express mail does not add postage, it is handled as ordinary mail, that is, 17 cents), single registration changes to add 2 cents, including postage, each letter is a total of 13 cents, double registration (registration fee plus 4 cents, including postage a total of 21 cents), fees for books, etc. are not added, everywhere</p>
<h3>The Postal Workers' Union Unanimously Advocates</h3>
<p>The Plan to Consolidate the Postal Foundation ▲Strive for the Implementation with All Their Strength by Sending Telegrams to the National Federation One After Another The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Staff Union have submitted a plan to consolidate the postal foundation to the Ministry of Communications for implementation. The progress of the proceedings has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, we received confirmation from the National Postal Workers' Union that the plan put forward by the two unions in Shanghai this time is completely based on the true opinions of more than 30,000 employees across the country. Therefore, since the plan was put forward, the postal workers' unions in Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Jiujiang, Kaifeng, Jinan, Nanchang, Wuhu, Anqing, Bengbu, Xuzhou, Jiangdu, Suzhou, Nanning, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Zhengzhou, etc. have unanimously advocated and sent telegrams to the Ministry of Communications to strive for it, and have sent telegrams to the National Postal Workers' Union one after another, resolving to support it with all their strength until the goal is achieved. Stores on North Sichuan Road Strive</p>
<h3>Exemption from the Spring and Summer Patrol Donations</h3>
<p>▲More than 100 Stores Jointly Signed a Letter of Request ▲The Citizens' Branch Announces that it will Strive for It One Hundred and Twenty-two stores on North Sichuan Road requested exemption from the spring and summer patrol donations, and jointly signed and sealed a letter to the Citizens' 17th District Branch for assistance. The association immediately forwarded the letter to the Taxpayers' Association for unanimous support, and also notified members yesterday. The letter is recorded below: ▲Stores jointly request This time, the citizens of our district have suffered from the destruction of the Japanese army. In February and March, nine out of ten houses were empty, and there was no sound of chickens or dogs. The streets were like wash. Although there have been successive returns in the past half month, the terror has not been eliminated, and dangerous situations are arising. There is no time to seek a livelihood, let alone to restore business. The cause of today's unprecedented catastrophe is that the Public Works Department easily handed over police power to the Japanese, resulting in this. From this observation, the obligation of taxpayers has been fulfilled, but the rights of taxpayers are like this. The exemption of patrol donations for two seasons is not an extravagance. The following signed store owners are determined to urge the Chinese directors of the Taxpayers' Association to actively negotiate and strive for victory. It is heard that the Public Works Department intends to divide the roads north of Suzhou Creek into grades, such as north of Peng Road, which is considered to have more severe disaster, and south of Peng Road, which is considered to have less severe disaster. But is the human hell of Sanyuan Temple on East Wuchang Road, and the repeated fires of Qingyun Lane, a fact that the disaster is less severe? Any resolutions made by the Public Works Department, if they have not obtained the consent of merchants and others, will be resolutely resisted. In particular, it is co-signed to the left, and it is hoped that your branch will advocate for justice. This is addressed to the 17th District Branch of the Municipal Federation, and is signed by 122 stores including Baohetang on North Sichuan Road. ▲Citizens' Branch Notification: This is a notification. Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, the losses suffered by Chinese merchants and citizens cannot be counted. The most serious losses were suffered by the citizens of our 17th district. Tracing the source, the Japanese soldiers occupied the public concession north of Suzhou Creek as a military base. The Public Works Department could neither take effective sanctions nor express the expulsion of Japanese soldiers from the country, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. The Public Works Department abandoned its duties, and the blame is undeniable. In view of this, the branch of this district has to run around and shout, urging the Chinese directors of the Taxpayers' Association to uphold justice and negotiate seriously with the Public Works Department, demanding compensation for losses, and at the same time requesting exemption from the spring and summer patrol donations to show preferential treatment. Who knows that on May 11th, the report stated that the Public Works Department's proposed methods for reducing and exempting municipal donations set the highest limit for special circumstances at three months, and the rest were divided into two months, one and a half months, and so on. Tracing back to the suffering and magnitude of the damage suffered by the region under the ravages of the Japanese army, after the ceasefire conference was concluded, it still felt painful to think about the past and it was not easy to recover. However, in the end, who should bear the responsibility? The truth is also very clear. Now, the Public Works Department insists on the number of months of exemption from the trivial patrol donations, which is not worth the candle. How can it be said to be appropriate in terms of law and reason? Therefore, our association, on behalf of the members of this region, continues to insist on the previous claim and strive to fight. In addition to having sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayer Association to work together, this is hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Medical and Nursing News After the Cessation of Hostilities</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in the city, it has been three months, and the intense warfare has also lasted for several months. Our soldiers and refugees have suffered extremely heavy casualties. The hospitals in various places are all overcrowded, and it is even more difficult to allocate the number of doctors and nurses. The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, in view of the needs of the situation, specially invited well-known medical and nursing groups in Hong Kong to organize the Hong Kong Chinese Doctors' Relief Committee. Doctors Feng Qingyou, nurses Gan Shufang, and 28 others came to Shanghai to serve. All the staff stayed at the Chinese Medical Association's new association at No. 7 Awenyi Road, Chi Pond Road. The entire upper floor of the association building was used as a dormitory for the doctors and nurses, and the rooms on the lower floor were used as reception rooms and dining rooms. All kinds of utensils for food, bedding, entertainment, etc. were temporarily set up, and everything was available. All expenses were covered by the Medical Association. The group stayed in Shanghai for more than two months and served in the First Hospital hosted by the Citizens' Maintenance Association, with remarkable achievements. Now that the war has ceased and the medical work has all ended, the patients who have not recovered have been transferred to formal hospitals in various places for treatment. The doctors and nurses will buy oars and return to Hong Kong this morning. It is heard that Dr. Niu Huisheng, president of the Medical Association, held a grand banquet last night at 7:00 p.m. to bid farewell and answer the high friendship.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Opium Public Sales</h3>
<p>▲ Remarks from an Official of the Anti-Opium Association</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, in light of the widespread implementation of opium public sales in various provinces in both the North and South, and the rumors of central government involvement, has united with various public organizations to launch protests. The situation has been reported in various newspapers. A reporter from the National Communications Agency, recognizing the implications of opium public sales on national honor and public health, specifically interviewed a key official of the association to discuss the matter. The following is a summary of the conversation:</p>
<p>(Question) The talk of opium public sales has been circulating for several years. Could you share the details of its development?</p>
<p>(Answer) Opium public sales have always been the most effective method for imperialists to invade and weaken smaller nations, killing to enrich themselves. Even a child knows the poison of this scheme. No country in the world would implement it domestically. In recent years, our country has been plagued by internal strife, and some unscrupulous warlords have repeatedly implemented it for profit. Although the central government has been unable to stop it, its harm has been limited to a small area and for a relatively short period. The central government has consistently expressed its commitment to the anti-opium legacy of Sun Yat-sen and the traditional policy of prohibition. The central government previously implemented public sales but, due to public opposition and the correction by honest officials, it was soon canceled. Unexpectedly, since Liu Ruiheng became the head of the Smoking Prohibition Committee last year, he has been seeking to curry favor with certain authorities and to advance his personal interests. He deliberately implemented opium public sales, even enlisting Li Jihong, who previously handled the opium special tax in Hunan and Hubei, and using Wu Lien-te to advocate for opium public sales in order to confuse public opinion. The subsequent erratic behavior of the Prohibition Investigation Office revealed the truth, which the public should still remember. Although it was canceled due to public opposition, Liu, Wu, and their ilk were extremely unwilling to let go of such a lucrative opportunity. They have been strenuously plotting the revival of public sales, leading to the strange phenomenon of public sales in various provinces. The harms of opium public sales are so obvious. It is outrageous that so-called intellectuals and medical doctors like Liu and Wu would openly promote it, sacrificing the nation and its people for their personal gain and advancement. This is truly a rare and bizarre spectacle in these degenerate times. Our association is committed to advocating for the public, and we are deeply saddened by this situation. We feel it is our responsibility to firmly oppose it, and there is absolutely no political or factional agenda involved.</p>
<p>(Question) What is your association's stance on opposing public sales, and what steps are you taking?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our association's stance on opposing public sales has been consistent from the start and will not waver due to environmental influences. We are prepared to face any oppression or sacrifice, as we have been entrusted by society with the important mission of anti-opium advocacy. The public's sympathy and trust in our association are growing daily, and our determination to fight is strengthening with time. For example, last year, due to our opposition to public sales, our General Secretary Huang Jia-hui and his wife were falsely accused of opium trafficking. Huang narrowly escaped assassination while investigating in Taiwan and returning to the mainland. At the same time, our association faced various serious and illegal forms of oppression. However, our members have not been discouraged but have become even more courageous. The public clearly understands the nature of those who harm us, and the number of those who share our views is constantly increasing. If our members unfortunately fall victim to the enemy's plots, we know that those who rise up in our place will be ten or a hundred times more numerous. We are fighting for justice, so what is there to fear? As for our steps to oppose public sales, they are very simple. Our backing is public opinion, and our weapon is public opinion. Our steps are nothing more than to arouse public sympathy, unify public opinion, use public opinion to supervise the government, and use public opinion to drive out those shameless opium peddlers and corrupt officials.</p>
<p>(Question) Could you provide some recent updates on the progress of public sales?</p>
<p>(Answer) The recent public sales in various provinces would not have been possible without the instigation or approval of the central government's anti-opium authorities. Currently, the central anti-opium authorities are planning public sales in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Wu Lien-te, the originator of public sales, has been traveling frequently between Beijing and Shanghai, secretly lobbying for this matter. According to reports, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Director Shu recently came to Shanghai and agreed on a fixed price of one million yuan per month with a representative of a certain silver company named Lu. It is expected to be implemented soon. We sincerely hope that all parties will rise up to protest and closely monitor this, so that the monsters under the bright sun dare not show their faces. It is a fortunate thing for opium prohibition.</p>
<p>(Question) It is said that there are international machinations behind the central government's implementation of opium public sales. Does your association have any information on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) We have not only heard about it but also know it in great detail. However, this matter is very complex and concerns national honor. We will not disclose it until it is absolutely necessary. We will discuss it in detail in the future.</p>
<p>Hua 界 Nine Acres</p>
<h3>Opium Organization Established</h3>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu Secretly Orders Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng has recently received several confidential reports stating that a large-scale organization for selling opium has been established near the Nine Acres area of the Chinese district. It is now fully operational and conducting business openly, which is a violation of the ban. With rumors of opium public sales circulating everywhere, and Shanghai being a focal point for international attention, a thorough investigation is required to eradicate the source of the problem. It is reported that Mayor Wu has secretly instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau to conduct a strict investigation.</p>
<p>County Government</p>
<h3>Provisional County Government Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Discussing Preparatory Procedures for Relocation</p>
<p>The construction project for Shanghai County's relocation to Beiqiao is scheduled to start with a public tender on the 16th of this month (tomorrow) and will be opened on June 1st. To prepare for the bidding process, the county government convened a provisional county government meeting yesterday, chaired by County Magistrate Yan. The meeting discussed the preparatory procedures at length and considered whether to tender for the new government buildings, roads, and bridges simultaneously. It was decided that the buildings and roads would be tendered first, while the bridges would be postponed. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products</p>
<h3>Introducing Overseas Chinese to Visit National Product Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products is introducing Zheng Bulun, the representative of the Chinese National Products Company from Cirebon, Java, to visit national product factories. Letters have been sent to various factories stating:</p>
<p>"This association received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 13th of this month, which stated, 'Greetings. On the 12th of this month, we received instruction No. 2161 from the Bureau of Social Affairs, which stated, "We received instruction No. 11265 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which stated, 'According to a report from Song Faxiang, the Consul-General in Java, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cirebon, Java, reported that overseas Chinese residents desire to purchase national products but suffer from a shortage of supply. Recognizing this, the Chamber has responded to the demands of the times and, together with a number of substantial merchants, plans to establish a large-scale national products company to purchase national products in bulk and sell them overseas. However, those who have been engaged in the national products business in Southeast Asia are largely unaware of the domestic market situation, resulting in goods that are of poor quality or unsuitable for the Southeast Asian market, leading to many failures. The Chamber has learned from past experiences and has selected Zheng Bulun to travel to China in April and May to investigate the production and sales of national products in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, Kaifeng, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, and other places, to serve as a standard for future purchases. We therefore request that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce be asked to instruct the relevant departments and chambers of commerce in the aforementioned provinces and cities to introduce Zheng to visit various national product factories upon his arrival and provide him with all kinds of conveniences." Please review and implement as appropriate. Upon investigation, the Chamber of Commerce in Cirebon's plan to organize a national products company to promote national products is indeed a matter of urgency. National product manufacturers in various regions should take advantage of Zheng Bulun's return to China to investigate, properly guide his visit, and widely provide information on national product manufacturing and promotional materials to encourage promotion. According to the report, in addition to instructing and separately ordering, we hereby order the bureau to send personnel and instruct the various national product companies and factories to comply. Upon Zheng Bulun's arrival, properly receive him and guide his visit, this order, etc., has been received.

<h3>Lee's Cause of Death Unknown</h3>
<p>▲ Police Suspect Disappearance and Begin Search ▲ Body Suddenly Found on North Suzhou Road</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao (North-China Daily News) reports that yesterday morning (12th), a watchman spotted a renowned British merchant, Lee, dead on the side of North Suzhou Road. His limbs were broken, and it appeared that he had fallen from the balcony of the Astor House Hotel. His body was half on the sidewalk and half in the street. The Hongkou police were immediately notified and dispatched officers to the scene. Dr. Wolffe also arrived in response to the call. Upon examination, Lee was already dead, with a fractured neck being the apparent cause of death. The coroner of the British Consulate examined the body yesterday afternoon and adjourned the inquest. The police are currently investigating the cause of death. According to official sources, the deceased resided on Yuanmingyuan Road but had been missing since the 3rd of this month. Although he had been spotted several times, his whereabouts were unknown. The police had recently listed him as a missing person and began searching for him this Wednesday. Therefore, there are many suspicions in this case. According to the watchman, the deceased was not seen entering the building. It is unknown whether his death was due to a fall, being pushed, or suicide.</p>

<h3>Judgment in Fraud Case Appealed</h3>
<p>▲ Original Sentence Doubled ▲ Eight Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lawyer Ren Zhennan previously defended Yong businessman Zhuang Chunfu in the public court against Huang Lianxiang's charge of bigamy. Afterwards, Zhuang Chunfu claimed that he had paid Ren over 5,000 yuan in settlement fees and handling fees, but Ren had not settled the case, causing him to suffer imprisonment. He was eventually released after another settlement. Therefore, Zhuang accused Ren of fraud and requested the Lawyers' Association to request the local court to investigate and publicly prosecute Ren. The court sentenced Ren Zhennan to four months imprisonment and ordered him to compensate Zhuang Chunfu for the loss of over 5,000 yuan. Ren was dissatisfied and appealed. After several court hearings and closing arguments, Shen Youqi, the judge, delivered the judgment yesterday, overturning the original judgment. Ren Zhennan was sentenced to eight months imprisonment for fraud, while the private prosecution portion remained the same. Ren Zhennan immediately declared his dissatisfaction with the appeal and intended to appeal again.

<h3>Impersonating Officers to Search for Opium</h3>
<p>▲ Extorting 140 Yuan ▲ A Special Russian Constable Involved</p>
<p>Lu Jinsheng, a native of Songjiang, has been working as a fruit vendor. Recently, his relatives Wu Renfu and Wu Sancheng came to Shanghai from Songjiang to seek refuge. They resided in Room 420 of the Wugong Hotel on Fuzhou Road. At 8 PM on the 11th of this month, Chen Changsheng (a local), Xu Zigen (from Wuxi), and a Russian named Leiweisiji (who works as an inspector at the telephone company and also serves as a special constable No. 60 in the Public Concession police force) suddenly broke into the room. Chen claimed that they were sent by the General Police Station to search for opium and began to search. They found a small amount of opium in a drawer and used this as an excuse to threaten them, saying that they had to be taken to the police station, otherwise, they would have to pay 300 yuan. Lu did not have such a large sum of money at the time and began to negotiate. They eventually settled on 140 yuan. Lu took out 40 yuan, and Wu Sancheng borrowed 50 yuan, totaling 90 yuan, and gave it to Chen Changsheng. The remaining 50 yuan was to be delivered to the Changle Teahouse on Fuzhou Road between 6 PM and 7 PM the following day, the 12th. Chen and the others then left with the money. Afterwards, Lu Jinsheng reported the matter to the Old Gate Police Station. The police chief ordered detectives Chen Yonggui and Ye Yusi, along with Western Detective Wilcox, to secretly go to the Changle Teahouse the day before yesterday and pretend to be tea drinkers. At 6:10 PM, Chen Changsheng, Xu Zigen, Di Chunxing, and Lu Wenzao went to Changle together. While Chen was talking to Lu, Lu handed Chen 10 yuan and was arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives. Xu, Di, and Lu were also taken into custody. 10 yuan were found on Chen and 28 yuan were found on Xu. Chen confessed that the Russian Leiweisiji was an accomplice. The Western Detective invited Lei to the police station, and Lei also admitted to the matter. Subsequently, detectives from the French Concession Police Station accompanied them to Lei's residence at 263 Avenue Albert in the French Concession, where 50 yuan were found. All were taken into custody and transferred to Criminal Division One of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the above situation and submitted the stolen money as evidence. The victim Lu Jinsheng also submitted a report verifying everything and pointed out that Chen, Xu, and the Russian were all in the hotel at the time, but he did not see Di and Lu. He also stated that he gave the 90 yuan to Chen. Yesterday, except for the Russian, the four went to Changle together, etc.</p>
<p>Chen and Xu confessed that they went to the Wugong Hotel with the Russian constable because they were informed that someone was running a large opium den with 17 opium pipes in Room 420. Lu Jinsheng voluntarily gave 90 yuan, of which 50 yuan was given to the Russian constable, and the informant took 30 yuan, with the remaining 10 yuan used for dinner. Lu also promised to give Chen a reward of 10 yuan, so he went to Changle yesterday to collect it, etc. Di Chunxing and Lu Wenzao denied the allegations, saying that they were arrested while drinking tea at Changle yesterday.</p>
<p>The Russian Leiweisiji confessed that he was a special constable in the police force. The previous evening, while he was passing through the Four Horses Road, Chen reported to him that someone was running a large opium den with 17 opium pipes in Room 420 of the Wugong Hotel. He went there with Chen and Xu. Upon arriving at the room, only one opium pipe and a small amount of opium were found. He did not want to make an arrest, so he left. Shortly after, Chen came after him and said that the plaintiff had given him 90 yuan and gave 50 yuan to him. He accepted it because the money had already been collected. He did not know anything about the Changle incident yesterday.</p>
<p>The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang and Tan Xinzhen, requested that the defendants be released on bail pending further questioning. Judge Qian Hongye ordered Chen Changsheng, Xu Zigen, and the Russian Leiweisiji to be detained. Di Chunxing and Lu Wenzao were each released on 500 yuan bail pending further questioning on a later date.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Prepares to</h3>
<h3>Restore Schools in War Zones</h3>
<p>Following the January 28th Incident, schools and cultural institutions in areas such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru were severely damaged. Now that the war zones are about to be gradually taken over, the Municipal Bureau of Education is actively preparing to restore the schools in these areas. The following is a brief account of the various situations: ▲Preparing to Take Over Schools in War Zones Due to traffic obstructions or occupation by Japanese troops, many schools have been unable to be managed. Now that the war zones will be gradually taken over, the Bureau of Education has sent personnel to the Takeover Committee to negotiate the takeover procedures. At the same time, all schools and cultural institutions were notified to register with the Bureau on the 14th and 15th of May. Once the takeover date is set, the Bureau will inform them by telegram to proceed with the takeover. ▲Investigating Losses Schools at all levels in the war zone have either been completely burned down or destroyed by bombing. Of the few schools that survived, they have either been used as stables by the military or looted by unscrupulous civilians. The Municipal Bureau of Education had previously investigated the losses of each school, compiled statistical tables, and sent personnel to inspect the situation. Now that the takeover has taken place, the Bureau will conduct an on-site investigation of the disaster situation of each school. ▲Planning to Restore Municipal Schools in War Zones Apart from Wusong Middle School, which had already temporarily opened in He'an Elementary School, the remaining elementary schools, some of which have been reduced to ashes and some of which have been severely damaged, cannot be opened until the damaged ones have been temporarily closed and renovated. Moreover, after the catastrophe, the local situation will inevitably be different from before. The Bureau should promptly investigate the situation of the residents and formulate a restoration plan. If school-age children have already returned to areas where schools are needed, temporary schools should be established to provide relief. Schools in the Chinese Concession</p>

<h3>Gold Price Recovers, Up 10 Liang</h3>
<p>▲Preparing for Swap, Shorts Post Prices The gold price rebounded yesterday and rose, remaining stable overall. Only 6.5 liang were recalled throughout the day, ultimately surging by 10 liang, a reversal from the previous day's decline. It opened higher from the start, likely because the silver price rose only slightly. Therefore, the industry's sentiment was bullish. Furthermore, the rumor that the international meeting on adopting silver currency would be postponed further fueled buying interest. As a result, it broke through 720 liang. However, there were few large trades at the start. In the afternoon, because the swap had already been done in advance, and the premium did not increase significantly, the market price slightly declined. The exchange rate also seemed to loosen. However, it then stood at the 720 liang border. The June to July swap was posted by the shorts, initially at 6.56 qian, then gradually decreased to 3.0 liang and then 4.0 liang, indicating that the longs were still willing to swap. It was found that the longs were mainly Yifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng, Runchangyu, Fuchang, and the Dalian gang. The shorts were mainly Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, each holding approximately 1,000 taels, with the rest being smaller positions. The Guangdong gang had few positions. The recent exchange turnover was approximately 18,000 taels. The market situation yesterday is recorded below: ▲Opened Up 9.8 Liang From the beginning, the June price jumped 9.8 qian to 719.5 liang. Large trades frequently increased by 5/16, the American silver price increased by 1/8, and private telegrams decreased by 1/4. Therefore, the opening was high. Zhifengyong and others bought, while Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, and Wanxinglai sold, lagging behind by 2 liang, at 17.5 liang. Then, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Yifeng, Yuhe, Hongkangyong, Xiexingyong, and others entered the market to buy. In addition, the exchange rate opened high, with August English gold settling at 25, and June at 1875, both in and out. August American gold was initially at 4375, then 375 was available for sale. The gold price suddenly jumped more than 6 liang, reaching 24 liang at 9:22. At this time, the near-term American gold was only priced at 30.875 yuan. Subsequently, Yuanmao and Yuantai sold, retreating to 21.5 liang. English gold opened at 23.5 liang, but the listed price did not change. Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, Bingxing, and Yuanchun also bought. Suddenly, the Dalian gang, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang sold, reaching 21.3 qian at 9:50. Yuanchun and Fuyu bought, reaching 23.2 qian after 10 o'clock. Then, HSBC and others offered English gold for this month at 25, and Shanghai offered American gold for August at 4375. Wanxing, Shunli, Xiexingyong, Richang, Zhifengyong, and others had already sold on the trading floor, causing the price to plummet by 3 liang. In half an hour, it fluctuated up and down by more than 1 liang. However, Shenkang and others bought, reaching 20.3 qian around 11 o'clock. Then, Hongkangyong, Hengyu, and Yuanchun bought again, pushing it up by more than 2 liang, reaching 22.7 qian at 11:30. Then, August American gold was traded reciprocally at 3125. Subsequently, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Wanxing sold, retreating by a few qian, reaching 20 liang at 11:45. Then, goods and retail investors dragged it up, so the afternoon closing was calculated at 21.9 qian, and the price was raised again to 23 liang after the market closed. The posted price was still 792 liang, with a deduction of 70 liang. ▲Mediocre Afternoon Market Situation The afternoon market opened slightly lower at 19.5 liang, because the swap had already opened, and the Dalian gang sold. Then, it reached 20.08 qian, and Dadecheng and others bought. However, the swap was suppressed to more than 3 liang, half of the initial opening. At 2:15, it was 19.5 liang. Not long after, it reached 21 liang. Then, Yifeng and Dadecheng bought. It was also rumored that the Indian exchange rate fell by seven. At this time, May American gold traded at 31 yuan. Citibank bought 1/3125 shillings. After 2:30, the sentiment turned downward, and Fuxingyong, Wanxing, and Yifengyong successively abandoned their positions, so the price fell by 3 liang, reaching 17.8 qian at 3:15. Afterwards, it seemed to stabilize, and retail investors bought, reaching 20 liang. However, it fell again to 18.6 qian, and then reached 20 liang, but trading was limited, and inflows and outflows were inconsistent. At 4:15, it was 19 liang again. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 19.7 qian, up 10 liang from the previous day. The highest for the day was 24 liang, and the lowest was 17.5, with a difference of 6.5 liang. The posted price was 734 liang, and the book price was 22 liang. The supplementary water was 22 liang in the afternoon, and the red bar was 7.25 to 7.5 qian. ▲Limited Trading Volume On the trading floor, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Fuxingyong, Yifeng, Hongkangyong, Bingxing, and Yuanchun all bought. Shunli, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and Yuankangxiang all sold. Yuhe, Hengyu, and Fuyu had very frequent inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Yifeng, and Dadecheng all bought. Shunli, Yuantai, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, and Fuxingyong all sold. Other inflows and outflows were complex. The American Exchange Rate Rose Sharply</p>
<h3>Near and Far Term Differences of Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the American silver price proposal will be extended. Although the silver market rose yesterday, the exchange rate was low. The HSBC exchange rate for English, American, and Hong Kong exchanges did not change. Only the Indian exchange rate increased by half a yuan, and the German exchange rate decreased by 0.25 yuan. The bank trading price continued to rise. The price was firm at first, then slightly fluctuated, and seemed to loosen in the afternoon. The gold market was high early then depressed later, but ultimately stabilized, for an overall increase of ten taels. As a result, the English gold market shrank by 0.25 compared to the closing price last night, and the American gold market shrunk by 0.6875, a reflection of the sharp loosening the day before. Transactions by Chinese merchants and speculators were not as active as the previous day, with approximately 100,000 pounds of English gold changing hands, with varying outflows and inflows. The American Silver Company bought this month's supply in the afternoon. Approximately 5-600,000 yuan in American gold was traded. Gold shops were busy, with frequent transactions. The opening market situation is recorded below. ▲The English Exchange Internal Market fluctuated by 1.875 throughout the day, but the swap difference was 0.125. The selling price in the early market was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.125 to 0.25, and the buying price was 1.875 to 0.3125. Pan Gen bought August 0.3125, Mitsui sold 0.25.

The closing selling price was 0.3125 to 0.375, and the buying price was 0.375 to 0.4375. ▲The American Exchange Internal Market had a difference of 0.25, and the near-term and far-term differences were relatively large, approximately 0.5625 to half a yuan. From the early market, the selling price for this month was 30.875 yuan, 31 yuan for June, 31.1875 yuan for July, and 0.4375 for August and September.

Also sold to Chosen 31 yuan, and Maixing also sold 31 yuan. Anda sold, and Mitsui bought June 31.125. Shanghai bought August 0.4375. The closing selling price was still 30.0875 yuan, the far-term price was 31.4375 yuan, and the buying price was 31 yuan to 31.5625 yuan. The listed price was one yuan, equivalent to silver 3.30578 liang.</p>
<h3>Large Transactions Reduced by 0.25 Each for Near and Far Terms</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 13th: Large transactions shrank. The closing price for the near term was 17 pence and 0.125, and the far term was 17 pence and 0.125, each shorter by 0.25 compared to the previous day. Also, the London to New York exchange rate was changed to 3 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen, and 5.</p>
<h3>Gradual Decrease in Interest Rates</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Yesterday's market trading activity was less vibrant than the previous day in both markets. However, sellers continued to offer an unlimited supply of foreign currency, while buyers, due to weak consumption, were unable to absorb it. As a result, interest rates continued to decline. The trend in the money market showed a somewhat novel and brisk atmosphere in the morning, but by the afternoon, liquidity became difficult, leading to a decline. Market prices decreased due to selling pressure, with early interest rates rising but weakening in the afternoon. Auxiliary currencies generally increased, while copper coins were released for a longer period.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate Prices: (Foreign currency interest) The morning rate was 7 mace and 3 li, a decrease of 3 hao and 7 hu and a half compared to the previous day's afternoon rate. The market sentiment remained unfavorable, so there was no competition in the afternoon, resulting in the same rate as the morning at 7 mace and 3 li. (Silver interest) The morning rate was 1 qian, with banks quoting 4%, while the afternoon silver interest decreased by 2%, calculated at 8%. Fractional silver was quoted from 3-4% to pure silver.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Currency Market: Jiangnan small foreign coins increased by 1.5 li compared to the previous day, with the morning rate at 6 qian, 1 fen, 2 li and a half, and the afternoon rate at 6 qian, 1 fen, 3 li. The trading volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning and also only 5,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian and 2.5 li in the morning, and also good for 375, at 6 qian, 2 li, 8 hao and 7.5 hu in the afternoon. The trading volume was 145,000 jiao in the morning and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were released for a longer period at 1,500 wen, totaling 420,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Inflow and Outflow: (Silver currency) Yesterday, banks received more remittances from foreign merchants than Chinese merchants, with foreign merchants receiving remittances of 2.7 to 2.8 million, and Chinese merchants receiving remittances of 1.7 to 1.8 million. Exchange remittances exceeded 1.3 million, goods remittances exceeded 2 million, mortgage remittances exceeded 1 million, miscellaneous remittances exceeded 3 million, telegraphic transfers exceeded 900,000, special remittances were 500,000, foreign currency remittances exceeded 600,000, and customs duties revenue exceeded 500,000. Chinese merchants deposited 400,000 in warehouses, while foreign merchants withdrew 800,000. Money shops and silver firms received remittances of over 35 million, fractional silver remittances exceeded 2.5 million, interest rate transactions exceeded 3 million, remittances from various routes exceeded 700,000, and cash receipts were several hundred thousand. (Foreign currency) Exchange remittances amounted to 465,000 in the morning and 411,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 30,000 in the morning and 20,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 75,000 in the morning and 50,000 in the afternoon. Checks were 90,000 in the morning and 35,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 400,000 each in the morning and afternoon. Foreign firms received and remitted over 1.3 million, banknote inflows and outflows exceeded 2 million, money shops and foreign firms received remittances of over 6.5 million, foreign fractional silver remittances exceeded 1.1 million, foreign currency lending inflows and outflows exceeded 1.5 million, small money shop transactions exceeded 500,000, customer sources were 300,000, and outflows were 400,000. The silver and money industry is in the process of final closing.</p>
<h3>Business Conditions</h3>
<p>The silver and money industry's final closing at the end of last year has not yet been held, and has been postponed to the end of this month for summarization, as announced by the Chamber of Commerce. As citizens are uniformly following this, the silver and money industry has been rushing to complete the closing procedures recently, and is extremely busy, with no time to attend to other new development plans. Even the most critical silkworm cocoon trade is being neglected. They are only actively pursuing the redemption of previously mortgaged silk cocoons. If borrowers cannot repay, they either transfer the debt to Shanghai, pursue the guarantor for compensation, or sell the collateral. However, there are no overly harsh coercive actions. From the silver and money industry's perspective, strict collection should be enforced to facilitate adjustment. However, observing the market situation, there are indeed difficulties, and they dare not make excessive demands to avoid criticism. Therefore, they are following the trend, collecting what they can and leaving the rest alone.</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Hover, Slight Increase</h3>
<p>▲ Market Situation Remains Quiet, Trend Continues to Stabilize</p>
<p>▲ Securities Exchange to Reduce Special Margin for Specific Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot and futures market conditions for various bonds at the Chinese Securities Exchange were as follows: The futures market remained sluggish, with little activity from both buyers and sellers. The total transaction volume for the morning and afternoon sessions was 1.72 million yuan, with salt tax bonds accounting for over 400,000 yuan, and the 20th year customs bonds and the 19th year consolidated tax bonds each accounting for over 200,000 yuan. Other bonds had very little trading. Spot transactions included 21,000 yuan for the 20th year bonds, and approximately 10,000 yuan each for demobilization and disarmament bonds and salt tax bonds. Other bonds generally traded for only 1,000 yuan. The price trends for all bonds remained relatively stable, with the morning and afternoon markets hovering without significant fluctuations. Although the overall market sentiment continued to be dull, the increased activity from market participants compared to the previous day led to a gradual recovery in prices. The six-month term whole bond and the six-month term demobilization bond rose by approximately 8 jiao, while other bonds saw changes of only 2-3 jiao. The bond market is unlikely to see significant development in the short term. Furthermore, due to the recent stable market and low transaction volume, the Securities Exchange is reportedly considering slightly reducing the special margin for specific bonds.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Further Weakens</h3>
<p>▲ Report from American Eastern Bank</p>
<p>On Thursday, adverse news continued to emerge. The New York Central Railroad suspended interest payments, and the Union Pacific Railroad reduced its dividend to $6. Consequently, market sentiment weakened, and selling was enthusiastic, especially for the aforementioned two stocks. Furthermore, due to the decline in wheat prices, the prices of various bonds were also affected. In terms of government bonds, due to numerous rumors regarding the government's financial situation, the situation was also poor. Although there was news of the Bank of England reducing its discount rate, and expectations of the New York Federal Reserve Bank taking similar steps, it did not seem to create a positive impression. The average price of industrial stocks fell to 55.62, a decrease of 11.21 pounds (sterling). Railroad stocks fell to 19.27, a decrease of 1.21 pounds (sterling). All railroad stocks fell, while utility stocks only fell slightly. The representative stock, "Commonwealth &amp; Southern," fell approximately 2 pounds (sterling), which was better than the 3-4 pound (sterling) decline in the railroad representative stock. The total trading volume for the day reached 900,000 shares, slightly better than the previous day, but there was no real improvement in trading interest. Although market participants are still awaiting news from Washington, general traders seem to have begun to lose faith. However, there is no definitive news yet.</p>
<p>(Following is the Dow Jones Daily Index)</p>
<p>[Table follows, showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Railroad Average, and Utility Average for May 11th and May 12th, along with the change.]</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Market Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market showed a slight softening, with fewer spot sales. Over the past three to four days, various groups have purchased a total of approximately 40,000 bales. It is expected that there may be a temporary halt, which is not surprising. Therefore, selling prices remain firm, and factories are maintaining a strong stance, as they have sold off a significant amount of their inventory. However, the Guangdong buyers have stopped purchasing, indicating a saturated demand. Jiangxi buyers, however, remain active. Market sentiment is mixed, with differing views on whether prices will rise or fall. However, based on actual observations, there is unlikely to be a strong upward trend, as the surrounding environment is not entirely optimistic, the domestic economic situation remains difficult to circulate, and Japanese factories are aggressively increasing production with cheap raw materials. Therefore, Chinese factories should take advantage of this opportunity to sell as much as possible.</p>
<p>▲ "Ren Biao" Market Turns Loose After Initial Strength: The opening of the "Ren Biao" (People's Standard) market was strong, with continued demand for spot sales. Buying sentiment in the market was still strong, but some profit-takers took the opportunity to close out their positions, causing a slight drop of 2-3 qian. Hearing that spot yarn conditions were still good, prices rebounded, resulting in a net decrease of 2-3 qian for each month. The afternoon situation changed abruptly, with a looser market and a slight decline of 1-4-5 qian for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,450 bales. Sales included 850 bales from Tongfu, 800 bales from Tongyu, 400 bales from Zhenda, 500 bales from Changji, 550 bales from Shenji, and 350 bales from Dachang. Purchases included 200 bales from Ruida, 750 bales from Jifeng, 350 bales from Dafeng, 200 bales from Tianlong, 1,250 bales from Gengfeng, 400 bales from Shenchang, 350 bales from Yuanda, 400 bales from Changfeng, and 250 bales from Yichang. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>[Table of Ren Biao Cotton Yarn Closing Prices Follows - showing various months, closing price, change, and inventory.]</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Continue to be Active: Spot yarn business remains strong. Total purchases by various groups for the day are estimated at 4,500 bales, of which 2,300 bales were carried over from the previous day. Guangdong purchased 2,110 bales, Sichuan 300 bales, Zhenjiang 200 bales, Jiangxi 800 bales, Ningbo 105 bales, Shantou 220 bales, inland regions 290 bales, Northern regions 115 bales, Southeast Asia 75 bales, Qingdao 55 bales, Anqing 10 bales, and fellow traders 215 bales. Prices rose again by 5 qian or so. Shenxin factory opened 500-600 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Outlook Still Favorable</h3>
<p>The cotton market started strong but then weakened, but the trend remains tight and market sentiment is good, because the inventory of domestic cotton is relatively low. However, the American cotton situation remains flat and weak. After accounting for exchange rates, American cotton "Middling" is only worth 33 taels, so manufacturers' attitudes are extremely depressed and they have no intention to buy. Furthermore, most have already purchased enough foreign cotton. However, yarn sales have been active recently, so some have made small purchases, but there have been no large-scale transactions. Bidding for standard cotton has buyers looking at prices above 34 taels.</p>
<p>▲ "Zheng Biao" Market Stable: The "Zheng Biao" (Zheng Standard) market opened with stable prices due to flat American cotton prices. In the second round, some short sellers covered their positions, causing a sudden rise of 2 qian. Prices fell slightly at the third closing, resulting in a net increase of 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, prices fell slightly, with some falling by as much as 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,800 dan. Sales included 600 dan from Renfeng, 400 dan from Dafeng, 700 dan from Tongfu, 500 dan from Mingde, 600 dan from Ruida, 900 dan from Shenji, 500 dan from Yicheng, 600 dan from Yichang, and 1,600 dan from Changhe. Purchases included 800 dan from Yu Chang, 400 dan from Yongchang, 1,000 dan from Changfeng, 800 dan from Tongxing, 300 dan from Yuanda, 300 dan from Shenchang, 500 dan from Gengfeng, and 500 dan from Tianlong. The closing prices of Zheng Biao are listed below.</p>
<p>[Table of Zheng Biao Cotton Closing Prices Follows - showing various months, closing price, change, and inventory.]</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Demand and Circulation: Spot cotton business is still not seeing major development, but the situation is very good, although trading is still flat. The following are the details of ongoing transactions:</p>
<p>Lingbao cotton: 34.00 taels, Shenxin purchased 100 pieces of spot goods for factory use.</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton: 31.50 taels, Chongxin purchased 200 pieces of spot goods for factory use.</p>
<p>Luoyang cotton: 33.60 taels, Weitong purchased 180 bales of spot goods for factory use.</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton: 31.50 taels, Dafeng purchased 100 pieces of spot goods for factory use.</p>
<p>American cotton: 32.60 taels, Shenxin purchased 150 bales of spot goods for factory use.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Unlikely to Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to good news from Liverpool, but then weakened due to reduced consumption and a depressed Wall Street. Futures fell by 4-6 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. English cotton futures rose by 2-3 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 20 points. Indian cotton market closed. (Original telegram recorded on the left, May 12th telegram)</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Poor Condition of Spring Silkworms in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>▲ Early Batch Already in Great Sleep, Cold Weather Prevents Emergence</p>
<p>Farmers in the four rural districts of Jiaxing have greatly reduced silkworm rearing this year due to economic panic. After collecting the silkworm eggs, the weather suddenly turned cold and hot, with continuous rain, which severely affected the silkworms. During the third molt, the silkworms turned yellow and suffered from rotten abdomens due to a day and night of sultry heat followed by thunderstorms, and many were discarded. The early batch is already in the great sleep (4th molt), but the extremely cold weather is preventing them from emerging. The late silkworms are only in the third molt, with vigorous leaf consumption, but development is delayed, and the situation is poor.</p>
<h3>Selected Raw Silk Maintains Strong Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port remained lifeless. European and American markets saw sluggish sales of White Filature and other brands, and prices continued to weaken. Few telegraphic orders were forwarded to Shanghai, and market sentiment was depressed. However, the Shanghai stock of selected raw silk remained thin. Chinese silk merchants held firm and prices held. Yesterday, Xinfu and others imported 30 bales of "Lin Ma" brand top-grade No. 2 Zhili white raw silk at a price of 765 taels. Zhonghe imported 10 bales of "Gong He" brand top-grade No. 1 Zhili white raw silk at a price of 680 taels.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Sales Brisk, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port saw brisk sales of green tea from both domestic and foreign firms. English firms such as Jinlong, Xiehe, Yihuo, and Tongfu were all stocking up, and the outflow seemed active. The entire market reached sales of over 400 chests. Tea from Suian fetched a price of around 140 taels, while domestic teas ranged from 100 to 115 taels, a decrease of 10-20 taels compared to the previous day. The current decline in tea prices is due to the soaring overseas silver prices, high exchange rates, and the lack of mail ships departing recently, leading merchants to be unwilling to hoard. With lower tea prices, sales have resumed, and the tea market trend is gradually normalizing.</p>
<h3>Grain: Foreign Rice Continues to See New Transactions</h3>
<p>▲ Futures and Spot Prices Both Flat and Soft</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was some activity in foreign rice from the Jiangbei and domestic routes, and the market shifted from weakness to stability. However, foreign firms were actively pushing, making it difficult to find an opportunity for a rebound. New transactions yesterday included Yuanli Foreign Firm selling 300 tons of No. 1 Saigon round-grain rice for delivery in the first half of July, priced at 5 taels and 5.5 qian. Shunquanlong sold 1,000 tons for delivery in the second half of July, priced at 5 taels and 6 qian. This price seemed to be 5 fen or 1 qian higher than the previous day's selling price. However, because long-grain and round-grain rice are different, and the delivery times also varied, the actual price was flat and soft. Yuanxing Foreign Firm and merchants on this street sold 5,000 bags of Min Yi for delivery in two weeks, priced at 10 yuan and 8.5 jiao, and another 500 bags for delivery in one week, priced at 10 yuan and 7 jiao. The price was similar to the previous market. The price of futures for small-sized Huilong rice rebounded slightly due to foreign firms' active bidding. Yesterday, 300 tons for May delivery opened at only 5 taels and 3 fen. Spot small-sized Huilong rice opened at 10 yuan and 6.5 jiao to 10 yuan and 4-5 jiao, and rough rice at 9 yuan and 4.5 jiao to 9 yuan and 3 jiao. 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were priced at 10 yuan and 6.7 fen. Among these, 3,000 bags of small-sized Huilong rice were shipped to Jiangbei, while the rest were collected on this street. Spot prices for various types of rice were also slightly lower than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Scattered Sales, Lower Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Cotton Cloth Has Been Declining Recently: Although the yarn market has strengthened, it is difficult to reverse the downward trend. The reason is that the funds of various regions are exhausted, purchasing power is weak, and the trend of falling prices for various goods has not ended, causing customers to wait and see.

<h3>On Irish Freeman (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>The father of the new Irish President, Mr. Eamon de Valera, was Spanish, and his mother was Irish. Therefore, what he inherited innately was a romantic and strong personality, as mentioned above. Therefore, Mr. de Valera's life story is full of twists and turns, and many strange anecdotes. But the most commendable thing among them is his prison escape in 1919, because it is an expression of the Irish national spirit of strength and romance. Mr. de Valera was arrested several times and almost died. But he was never killed, as if there was providence in it. In the spring of 1916, a revolution against the British took place in Dublin, the capital of Ireland. Mr. de Valera and his party were all arrested and imprisoned. Later, those who were imprisoned with Mr. de Valera were successively shot and martyred. However, Mr. de Valera was not immediately subjected to the death penalty because he was born in New York and had American nationality. The following year, he was released under amnesty. After his release, Mr. de Valera immediately summoned his subordinates, reorganized the (Sinn Fein) party, and expanded its revolutionary movement. Therefore, in May 1918, he was arrested again for inciting riots and imprisoned in Lincoln Prison in Ireland. Mr. de Valera's imprisonment this time was feared to be for life. Because Irish public sentiment was boiling at that time, and revolutionary ideas were rampant throughout the country. The British government treated Mr. de Valera like it treats Gandhi in India today. It was impossible to let him go, and it was impossible to kill him. So there was only the way of imprisonment. After Mr. de Valera was imprisoned, his party members wanted to get him out. So there was an organization of a committee. The committee selected dozens of daredevils who were able to go through fire and water. They were all capable of fighting to the death. They planned to rob the prison and release him. However, Lincoln was heavily guarded all around, and they knew it was inviolable. Therefore, they had to make a second plan. After a few days, some of Mr. de Valera's party members dressed up as farmers and went to cultivate near Lincoln Prison. When they had time, they sang rural songs next to the prison. Sometimes they mixed in Gaelic slang. Irish villagers liked to sing, so the jailers didn't care. They did not know that Mr. de Valera's party had used Gaelic to convey orders and communicate with each other in the singing. Therefore, Mr. de Valera knew everything in prison about how to arrange things outside the prison. Mr. de Valera was ordered by the rescuers to make a seal of the key to the main gate after prison and throw it in the field. So the fake key was also completed. But how to deal with the armed guards? A solution was soon found.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Freedom</h3>
<p>— Guan Chonglou</p>
<p>The explanation of the word freedom is that life should be based on the individual as a unit, and everything must be decided by oneself, and cannot be restricted by others. If life does not get freedom, it is like a bird in a cage, losing the joy of survival. So the two sentences (It is better to die than to be unfree) are for those who have lost their freedom.</p>
<p>A puppet can be manipulated by others. A zombie can be manipulated by others. Puppets and zombies are things that have lost their freedom. (If you lose your freedom, you might as well die cleanly.) From this point I can not help but think of those puppets and zombies of the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>Freedom has its limits. As the Western saying goes (The definition of freedom refers to not infringing on the freedom of others.) It can be seen that if you want freedom, you must first respect the freedom of others. Japan's dispatch of troops to our country this time is justified in order to protect overseas Chinese and to stop the boycott of Japanese goods. The purpose is nothing more than to allow Japanese people to act freely in China and Japanese goods to be sold freely in China. However, the result of Japan's dispatch of troops this time was the massacre of many of our people and the destruction of much of our property. And the anti-Japanese movement became more and more intense in our country. This is a lesson. (Seeking freedom by force is counterproductive.) So the Japanese want to achieve their freedom through aggression, but it will only see them exhausted.</p>
<p>All living beings in the world with souls are yearning for freedom. All oppressed nations in the world are yearning to break away from the shackles of imperialists. (Ideals are the mother of facts.) A life of freedom and equality will always be realized in the near future that we expect.</p>
<h3>Chinese Daughters</h3>
<p>— Lu Pin</p>
<p>"Shina" (支那) is a contemptuous and frivolous name for us by the Japanese. But I am now using it to title my article to use it as an encouragement. Liu Dajie wrote patriotic novels and used it as the title of his book, which is also based on this purpose. Last year, during the Northeast Incident, although our authorities adhered to a non-resistance policy, public sentiment was boiling, and young people rose up to join the army. The talents of women were no less than those of men. When the Shanghai Aid-Ma Troupe set out, there were female group members participating. Women in military gear became a beautiful story. It is a pity that the group did not cross the border and eventually dispersed. After the Shanghai Incident, there were female warriors in Feng Dayi's volunteer army and the Tianjin Skull Troupe who defended and killed the enemy, no different from men. And there are many unnamed heroines who work for the country directly or indirectly, anytime and anywhere. A few days ago, I read a Japanese newspaper with a Shanghai communication saying that they had found the diary of a Chinese female soldier, and were surprised and convinced by it. From now on, the Eastern Ocean dwarfs (Japanese) will no longer dare to underestimate Chinese daughters.</p>
<h3>Tea, Wine, and Parasitic Diseases</h3>
<p>— Bicheng</p>
<p>▲Tea Worm During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, Mao Shenfu of Wujiang was very fond of tea. He would drink several bowls at a time. Whenever he went out, he would wrap a small amount of tea in paper and place it in his sleeve, taking it out to chew and swallow from time to time. Throughout the year, his face was sallow and emaciated, as if he were ill. Later, this suddenly stopped. When asked, he said, "One year, while on a boat, I leaned against the railing and vomited. Suddenly, a worm emerged from my throat, its color jade green, several inches long, and floated away with the current. Since then, I have no longer been fond of tea, and my complexion has gradually become rosy. Later, he lived to be over eighty years old, and his spirit was still vigorous. It is thought that the worm he vomited was probably of the same type as the 'second peck' mentioned in the Qing Yi Lu."</p>
<p>▲Wine Turtle Some years ago, during a banquet at the Zhang residence in Wumen, a guest spoke of the Wine Turtle, which was very strange. The guest was from Guangfu, and said that there was a carpenter in his village named Jia, who was very fond of wine. All his wages were paid to the wine shop. Over time, he became ill and was unable to work. His family of several nearly froze and starved. After a long illness without a cure, one day, Jia happened to be at his doorstep when a wandering monk passed by. The monk looked closely at Jia and said, "Are you sick from wine?" Jia said, "Yes." The monk said, "I can cure it, but it will be slightly painful, but only for a moment. Can you endure it?" Jia's wife was also beside him, and both said they could endure it. They asked how much the reward would be. The monk said he didn't care about it. So the couple were happy. They asked how to cure it. The monk said, "It must be in an empty room, and I will do as I see fit." They agreed. He ordered them to tie Jia's hands and feet with rope. His wife hesitated. Jia said, "I will die from the illness anyway. I am not afraid." After being tied up, he was ordered to lie on the ground, and a bowl of good wine was placed in front of him. Jia smelled the wine, and saliva dripped from his mouth. After a while, his stomach began to hurt. After a long time, the pain became more severe, reaching his chest. He cried out for help. The monk warned him not to move, saying, "Do not let the effort be wasted. Endure it a little longer, and it will be over." After another while, a turtle, the size of a silver coin, emerged from his mouth and jumped into the bowl of wine, its back black and its belly purple, swimming in the wine. The monk immediately untied him, and the pain was as if it had disappeared. After that, his illness gradually healed, and he no longer liked wine.</p>
<h3>The Future of Film</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>I once read an American magazine in which the great inventor Thomas Edison said in a speech that the invention and progress of film, according to his ideal, could be divided into three stages. From moving performances to transmitting sound, it could be said that the second stage had already been successfully achieved. In the future, further research and improvements could eliminate the need for a screen and allow for screenings anywhere. With a simple adjustment, the film would appear, and viewers would feel as if they could touch the events on the screen. Only then would it reach the realm of marvel. At the time, some listeners thought it could not be achieved, and after Edison's death, many doubted that this ideal could be realized. Unexpectedly, news recently came from England that the art of aerial imaging had been largely completed by scientists in that country. When it is made public to the world in the future, the word "screen" will no longer be applicable. This is a novel matter, and I know that those who are addicted to movies will surely want to see it first. According to the original text, after the invention of film, deficiencies were noticed. One of these was that the screen projection was always on a flat surface and could not be viewed from the side at will. This differed from looking at ordinary pictures through a magnifying glass only in whether it was moving or not. Therefore, can the films shown on the market today be called realistic? In the near future, we will see the emergence of the latest type of film, which is easy to use and, when shown, can make the audience think that the actors are performing live, and not from a film. It has already undergone many tests and can truly be called lifelike. Currently, the inventor mentioned above has not disclosed the secret of aerial imaging. The detailed content cannot be explored. What is known is that this type of film does not use a screen. Any part of the hall or reception room can be used for projection. The scenery and actors are all in the air. The projector is equipped with various optical lenses, presumably using the principle of light wave refraction.</p>
<h3>Record of the Rongma Shuanglou (51)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Seeking Favor Reaches the Door, Often Causing the General to Stumble; Imprisonment in Love's Jail, the Jailer Can Be a Husband's Cage. It is said that in Beijing City, there is a most famous Jinxiangyu Hutong. There are many large mansions connected in the hutong, but the largest and most extravagant one is the newly built Ye Residence. It was the new residence built by Military Governor Ye Zuozhang. He spent countless sums of money to build this residence into a luxurious and extravagant place. It can even be regarded as a combination of Chinese and Western styles and a complete collection of architecture. Chinese styles such as the large courtyard, opera stage, garden, pavilions, and terraces are all available. There are also two Western-style buildings with complete facilities such as restaurants, dance halls, bathrooms, and ballrooms. Almost all kinds of Chinese and Western buildings can be found as a specimen in his residence. Although it encompasses everything and can be called grand, it is a pity that it is too discordant, like a bowl of potpourri. Since its completion, he himself has been a military governor in other provinces and rarely comes to Beijing. In total, he has not lived in this house for more than ten days. This time, he came to Beijing to participate in some military and political conferences, and he arrived with great fanfare, staying in this house. Unconsciously, half a month passed. This time, the hutong became even more lively. Every day, from morning to night, the traffic was very crowded, almost bursting the narrow hutong. These were all kinds of people entering and leaving the Ye Residence, vying to serve and cater to him, creating a scene of prosperity. Sometimes, if there was a big banquet or a major celebration in the Ye Residence, there were too many guests, and it was necessary to specify a traffic route. A team of armed military police guarded the east entrance of the hutong, near the main road, and only allowed cars to enter. Other carriages and rickshaws required guests to get out and walk. Furthermore, they were only allowed to enter, not exit. Cars leaving the Ye Residence had to detour out of the west entrance and take another route. There were also sentry posts and military police at the west entrance to supervise and direct traffic. Often, they were still taking care of things late into the night, and the cars were still honking incessantly, disturbing the nearby neighbors who couldn't get a good night's sleep. One day, around four o'clock in the afternoon, cars were arriving one after another outside the gate of the Ye Residence, carrying who knows how many strange guests. However, there was only one car from which a graceful and beautiful female guest stepped out. Two idle soldiers standing outside the gate glanced at her and whispered to each other, "The superiors haven't called for any passes yet. This woman seems to be new. But she's really pretty and has quite an air about her. Doesn't look like someone from a brothel, but she doesn't have any attendants either. What kind of person is she?" As they spoke, the female guest walked slowly and entered the gate.</p>

<h3>Findings from the Investigation</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Why did Gu Weijun insist on following the League of Nations investigation team to investigate in the Northeast? Although it is said that it is in accordance with the resolutions of the League of Nations, everyone knows that the organization of the puppet Manchukuo is a Japanese puppet. What is the use of the investigation? Now that he has arrived in the Northeast, what will be the result of the investigation? The first thing he will get is the arrest warrant from the puppet state, and the second thing he will get is the cancellation of the puppet state's name. Gu Weijun's trip was not to investigate the puppet state, but to cancel the puppet state's name.</p>

<h3>In Response to an Expressed Feeling</h3>
<p>— Chen Yong'an of Southern Yunnan</p>
<p>The stars dim at dawn, tears cease, the west wind rustles, leaves fall, autumn frightens, Feng Huan idly strums his long sword, Bai Fu cannot cover himself in a large fur coat, the nation's states change like Qi once changed Lu, the dust of the world shares no hill with the thief Zhi, taking a single arrow from Liaocheng is still worthwhile, dreaming of the three swords of Yizhou all the more,</p>
<p>The great misfortune of the Liaodong pig is also painful, strong neighbors invade, fully armed, never heard of a leopard skin remaining after breaking through the enemy's lines, only seeing the arm of a mantis blocking the car, thinking of Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi's accomplishments and fame, sighing at Peng and Shang's premature deaths in the karmic cycle of sand worms, who among the neighbors values righteousness, standing idly by, acting as a wall,</p>
<p>Now we see the ferocious and greedy Qin again, swallowing everything, unwilling to stop the war, all things in the world are chaotic, startled by the scorching sun, the eight directions are in turmoil, the common people suffer, the moon shines on the shattered shadows of mountains and rivers, the wind stirs the sad sound of war drums, what is the point of calm negotiations and etiquette, empty talk on paper, ashamed of deep feelings,</p>
<p>The autumn colors of Yuguan are cool in September, the confused beacon fires deeply wound the heart, how many people can be pillars of heaven, today there are no sea defenses, distant lands open roads beyond the clouds, the Divine Land is half in the middle of the water, discussing national affairs and military matters of great importance, have you ever had any precautions,</p>

<h3>The Method of Making Soap</h3>
<p>— Yue Zhao</p>
<p>In the year 79 of the Western calendar, the writings of the Westerner Pliny the Elder recorded that the Colombians invented a method of mixing wood ash and lime in water to form a solution of potassium hydroxide (Potassium Hydroxide, the molecular formula is KOH). When this solution is cooked with oils and fats to a suitable temperature, the fire is removed, allowing it to cool and solidify, thus becoming washing soap.</p>
<p>The factories of various countries now follow this method. However, sodium hydroxide (Sodium Chloride molecule, or NaOH) is used instead of potassium hydroxide because the properties of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are exactly the same. During manufacturing, butter (pork fat can also be used) is placed in a pot and heated to gradually melt it. After it has completely melted, the sodium hydroxide solution is poured into the pot, stirring vigorously to mix it with the butter. After foam appears on the surface of the liquid, the fire is extinguished, these foams are removed, and pure salt is added to the pot, stirring in the same way. After some time, white powder floats up. Then, these powders are placed in a mold, and when they are cold, they gradually solidify, becoming ordinary laundry soap.</p>
<p>The method of making scented soap is the same as that of ordinary soap. However, after adding salt, the floating white powder must be taken out, washed with clean water, and then heated to boiling, injecting fragrances or disinfectant medicines, and then placed in a mold. When it cools and solidifies, it becomes scented soap.</p>
<p>Why can soap wash away dirt? This is because soap is made of butter and sodium hydroxide. When it encounters water, part of it decomposes into sodium hydroxide, and part of it decomposes into fatty acids. The sodium hydroxide contains saltiness and can combine with dirt, sinking to the bottom of the water; it can also create large bubbles, sticking and floating dirt on the surface of the water: fatty acids are very greasy and can help with washing. Therefore, soap is a necessity for washing.</p>
<p>In addition to washing with soap, soda ash and lye can also be used for washing. Because soda ash and lye both contain alkalinity, their dirt-removing effects are similar to those of soap, but without the help of fatty acids. Moreover, they contain too much alkalinity, which can easily damage the washed objects, so this cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>The Cab Driver Class and the "Pig" Slogan</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>As a streetcar sped forward, a car suddenly cut in front of it at an intersection. The streetcar driver quickly slammed on the brakes, avoiding a collision. The streetcar driver, because the car driver had delayed his time and route, would naturally curse, "Pig!" At that time, the car driver, to avoid a fine, could only silently accept the elegant title of "Pig."</p>
<p>As a car was speeding forward, a rickshaw puller suddenly pulled a rickshaw, blocking his way. After the car driver braked, he would naturally curse, "Pig!" The rickshaw puller was smart, knowing that the car carried rich and powerful people, so how dare he argue with the car driver? Under the title of "Pig," he could only silently run away.</p>
<p>As a rickshaw was passing, the puller was using all his strength to desperately pull the rickshaw forward, suddenly a small cart driver came from the opposite direction, his cart was full of seven or eight bags of rice, and he was slowly pushing the cart like an ant, with sweat pouring down his forehead. Luckily, the rickshaw puller was quick and stopped, otherwise he would collide with the small cart. At that time, the rickshaw puller, in great anger, would also naturally curse at the small cart driver, "Pig!" The small cart driver and the rickshaw puller were originally unfortunate coolies, but comparatively, the rickshaw puller was slightly higher up, so the small cart driver only accelerated his pace and pushed forward, not arguing with the rickshaw puller and silently accepting the title of "Pig."</p>
<p>We only need to live in Shanghai for a few years to often see this situation on the road. Here, we can also see that the class among the car drivers is also very clear. In addition, when pedestrians cross the road and are almost crushed under the wheels of a speeding streetcar or car, after escaping with their lives, the streetcar or car driver will curse, "Pig!" Under the shock, the person is still trembling, his mind is not settled, so naturally he does not care that someone is giving him the title of "Pig." There are many vulgar phrases for cursing people, but the first sentence that car drivers curse is usually "Pig," so the two words "Pig" have invisibly become the common slogan for car drivers to curse people. This is also a fine structure in Shanghai's unique art of cursing, right?</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Faithful Believer</h3>
<p>— Lao Tang</p>
<p>A few strands of tempting gongs and drums drifted in the wind, attracting another me, a "sightseeing" Buddha, to the Jing'an Temple on the Bathing Buddha Festival.</p>
<p>After seeing the big wooden fish in the corridor, I ran into the house with the words "Great Hero Hall" hanging at the entrance.</p>
<p>The house was filled with seventeen or eighteen girls shaking their big butts, old women with bound feet reciting Amitabha Buddha, various bosses who came specifically to find the God of Wealth (at the incense and candle place), and workers who reeked of alcohol and garlic and were too unpleasant to approach.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was extremely tense, the smoke was extremely diffuse. Here, the sincere seeking minds of ordinary incense burners and the critical gazes of onlookers are all offered before the "Greatly Compassionate Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva." The Bodhisattva still lowers her eyebrows and is merciful, her big belly is inclusive, and her smile is amiable, as if saying (you general foolish men and women).</p>
<p>Suddenly, "Amitabha Buddha" filled the entire Great Hero Hall. Looking back, a young man in a suit and a modern girl were bowing deeply before the majestic Bodhisattva, without any regard for the tightly permed hair on their heads and the straight line of their suit pants.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I approached him and her (apparently a couple) who were silently chanting something in their mouths.</p>
<p>The monk ran eagerly in front of them, seemingly waiting for a very great hope to arrive.</p>
<p>Several colorful banknotes, from the hand of the young man in the suit, to the hand of the monk with the bald head, then the sound of (benevolent and generous) (Bodhisattva bless you) replaced the sound of (Amitabha Buddha) just now, and filled the entire house.</p>
<p>The monk, full of spring breeze, took the banknotes and asked the young man's (honorable last name) (first name). He - that young man took out a business card unhurriedly and handed it to the monk's outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Although the eyes, blinded by the smoke, were not far from that business card, but because the time was short, I only saw two words. I didn't remember these two words wrong: (Ling Jing).</p>
<p>Walking out of the temple door, it seemed that I could still hear the young man asking: (Is there an Old Man Under the Moon here)?</p>
<p>On the way home, I recited in my mouth (faithful believer) (Bodhisattva's) (faithful believer)! (Modern girl's)!</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>
<h3>Painful Engagement</h3>
<p>— Si Ren</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. ×, is a teacher at a middle school, twenty-eight years old, and has not yet found a spouse. In his boredom, he often discussed this matter with me. I advised him not to be hasty and to avoid the harm of (hasty marriage).</p>
<p>A red letter came in the mail the other day. When I opened it, it was Mr. ×'s engagement announcement. Its words were quite peculiar. Whether it conformed to the times or to opportunism, I dare not say. I will record it for conversation:</p>
<p>Respectfully inform you that my little son ×× and little daughter ×× are now engaged with pain on the day of the National Humiliation Day of May 9th through the introduction of Mr. ×× and Mr. ××. To show that we do not forget the meaning of national humiliation (the author is imitating the tone of engaging without forgetting national humiliation, and not forgetting engagement for national humiliation). We hereby report this. ××× Respectfully inform.</p>
<p>After reading it, a cloud of suspicion arose in my mind. (Is there also painful engagement? Does painful engagement indicate a determination to jointly avenge the humiliation in the future?) This could not help but raise a great question in my mind.</p>
<p>As I was writing, my old friend P said, (Old Zhang, you are too confused. Painful... is such a fashionable word, a modern phrase! Haven't you seen painful opening, painful entertainment, painful dancing, painful playing cards, painful...? Even the government is painfully meeting, painfully signing, painfully..., the whole country, everything is painfully, so how can engagement be an exception?)</p>
<p>Certainly There</p>
<h3>In the Streetcar</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>Most people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know how difficult it is to travel in Shanghai, and it is especially dangerous in buses and streetcars. If your pocket bulges, no matter what is inside, you must be patronized by friends who specialize in opening boxes, and if you wear a beautiful hat and sit in the streetcar, it will disappear in an instant when the car passes through an intersection, leaving you watching it fly away and crying in vain.</p>
<p>Last Friday night, I took the streetcar from Cadre Road to Stealing Chicken Bridge because of something. After a few stops, the passengers gradually became crowded. Soon, two friends in black gowns walked in from the third-class car and stood in front of me. They did not buy tickets. I thought they must have monthly tickets, right? When the car arrived at Nicheng Bridge, one of them jumped off. In an instant, the car arrived at Stealing Chicken Bridge, and the passengers went down one after another. Finally, I also stood up to prepare to go down. Unexpectedly, the friend in front of me deliberately stood in front of me. I suddenly felt a hand touching my pocket. Looking back, the fountain pen inserted in my pocket was missing! I suddenly realized the reason why those two friends wanted to be my temporary bodyguards.</p>
<p>So, I turned around quickly and grabbed the suspected pickpocket next to me. He was also very calm and lifted his robe, letting me search. However, those with experience told me that searching is useless. There is not just one pickpocket. Who can be sure that he didn't pass the stolen goods to someone else?</p>
<p>(I have been telling you passengers to be careful of your pockets...) As I got off the car, the ticket seller said loudly, showing his duty to serve. In fact, he never cared about me like that, and while I asked him to open the door slowly so that I had a chance to catch and search, he still opened the door, letting the pickpocket escape!</p>
<p>In the end, is it that the friends who freeload in society are afraid of their power? Or is it like the (officials protecting each other) on the political stage? I doubted.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3>Payment for Manuscripts</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Because Mr. So-and-so's article (What Should Be Known During the National Crisis) published in the ×× magazine, said every word with blood and tears, and every point was reasonable, making me admire him to the point of prostration!</p>
<p>Today, during Chinese class, Zhang Jun said to Mr. So-and-so: (Yesterday afternoon, I saw you and your girlfriend walking into the Beijing Cinema. I called you, but you ignored me.)</p>
<p>(I really didn't hear you, sorry. You said my girlfriend, then I can't accept that). Mr. So-and-so replied apologetically.</p>
<p>(In short, you always deceive people. Haven't you been worried about the money not being remitted these past few days, but I heard that you still came in a car last night. Is watching movies and taking cars free? Why do you pretend to be so poor, and no one has asked you to borrow money)!</p>
<p>(Here you go again, I'll tell you the truth, I just received the payment for the manuscript from the ×× magazine, the payment for that article (What Should Be Known During the National Crisis).)</p>
<p>(Oh! Is dating, watching movies, and taking cars the payment for the manuscript of what should be known during the national crisis?)</p>
