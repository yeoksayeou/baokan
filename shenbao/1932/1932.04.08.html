<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>從言論自由說到思想自由彬</h3>
<p>關於言論自由。吾人既曾於去年十一月間發表「言論自由之眞諦」一評。認爲此爲人民神聖不可侵犯之權利。政府絕不應加以若何之限制與干涉。今請更進而主張思想絕對自由。</p>
<p>此一主張之提出。或者有人視爲近有滑稽。同時或又有人視爲决洪水之防堤。危機至大。前者以爲吾人個人潛在之思想。固未嘗不自由。且亦無人可能予以限制。後者則以爲今日社會既已騷亂。若再取絕對之放任主義。對於思想不予以相當之防範。是無異於抱薪救火。將益以增長亂源。凡此兩說。自其表面視之。固皆似言之成理其實皆非。</p>
<p>吾人認思想自由之正確解釋。不爲個人思想「潛在」之自由。而應爲個人思想「公表」之自由。蓋人生皆有腦。即生皆有思。吾人靜思默念。即窮天極地。幻想萬象。固亦無人可能窺知。更無人可能加以束縛。然而此不過木偶之自由耳。吾人認爲行動固當受法律之拘束。而思想必予以公表之自由。使得與他人交通。以引起社會之評論與研究。公開討論。而後思想乃爲有意義有價値。吾人今日固皆有木偶式之思想潛在之自由矣。然而果有思想公表之自由乎。此吾人於主張思想自由之先。不能不正確辨認其眞諦之一解也。</p>
<p>次之。今日我國家我社會。固已陷入動盪不寗之境。靑年之思想。固極駁雜不純。然而此種動盪之現象。實爲由於政治之紊亂與社會經濟之破落。而非由於駁雜思想之鼓盪。抑且正以社會之動盪。民生日蹙。而政治上之權力者。乃更從而予以重重之桎梏。使其有思而不能思。有主張而不能公表。不能自由覓取出路。憤激鬱聚。適足以使其挺而走險。以求一快。是蓋有苦築堤防水。似可防患於一時。而洪濤激盪。堤終將一决而不可收拾。固莫若撤除堤防。多開水道。使水得其平。得暢其流。庶不至激爲拍天之巨浪。此吾人於主張思想自由之先。不能不明白辨認其利害之又一解也。</p>
<p>自國民黨主政以來。即厲行黨治。一切庶政。都以「黨化」爲前提。舉凡人民之思想與言論。概加以束缚。尤其自民十七國共分裂而後。對於思想言論。限制尤嚴。凡與國民黨主義與立場不同之他種學說。他種主義。不僅絕對不許其流傳。抑且絕對杜絕其研究。數年來靑年之斷送於此者。蓋已無可數計。吾人誠不知當局對於此種限制。亦嘗於法理上曾否加以深切之研究。更不知當局此種限制。是否能確信其遂足以遏抑人民不可遏抑之思潮。</p>
<h3>停戰會議不絕如縷</h3>
<p>撤兵期限討論無結果　　英使提三項折中辦法　　大會定明日午後再開停戰會議、昨日上下午在英總領事館開會兩次、出席代表如前、日軍完全撤退期限問題、中日雙方、仍各堅持、英公使藍溥森提出折中辦法三條、以期打開僵局、中日代表允各向政府請示、定明日星期六下午三時、再開會議、繼續討論、至軍事小組委員會全體代表、昨日下午二時、視察吳淞、並定今晨續開會議討論日軍退駐地點問題、</p>
<h3>上午會議情形</h3>
<p>昨日上午十時、中日停戰會議代表·暨各友邦公使參贊、均準時出席、當會議前、小組委員會代表首先報告前日議决經過、定下午二時、分往前方視察、報告一過、中日雙方代表均無異辭、乃即開始討論、惟小組代表因下午二時、須往撤兵地點視察、故於十一時四十分先行退席、當昨晨雙方開始討論時、日首席代表植田首先詢問吾方代表、謂關於蘇州河南及浦東一帶之華軍駐防問題、日方實係根據停戰協定第一條、須包括停止兩軍一切敵對行動、故日方不特須明瞭蘇州河南及浦東一帶之駐軍狀况、在原則且須明瞭中國領土内之軍事行動、故無論如何、須要求華方代表、說明蘇州河南及浦東之駐軍情形、吾方首席代表郭外次聆言、當即堅决聲明、當上次會議時、關於此點、中國早已明白表示、在事實上以上兩處、雖在交戰時期、中國軍隊、可以利用之而進攻日軍、但當時中國軍隊之抵抗日軍、純屬自衛、該兩處既未受有日軍攻擊、故亦未曾進攻日軍、此在交戰期間、已可見華軍之不願在蘇州河南及浦東方面、爲進攻日軍之地帶、矧在此停戰撤兵期間乎、况在協定原則上、初無討論此項問題之規定、更在中國主權上、絕對不容他人過問中國軍隊在中國境内之行動、日方之此項詢問、實屬超越協定原則之新問題、蓋前所訂之停戰協定、原指加入作戰之軍隊與已成戰區之地帶而言、絕對不牽涉其他區域、在原則上早已顯然、何必多事無謂之討論、何况日方所指地點、中隔公共租界與法租界乎、日代表聆語、乃復　以聲辯、謂蘇州河南與浦東方面之駐軍、討論業已多次、究竟中國方面、是否承認以上兩處、在協定第一條包括之内、當日代表發言時、措辭殊爲嚴厲、我方郭代表、乃亦以簡捷之論調作答、謂此項討論、初不在範圍之内、因協定範圍所規定者、爲已參加戰事關係者爲限制、以上兩處、與此次戰事無關者也、此時雙方態度、均極嚴重、日方見郭代表堅强答覆、默然良久、各友邦代表見狀、誠恐决裂、乃向我方代表婉勸謂、蘇州河南與浦東一帶、中國本無駐軍、無妨加以說明、俾袪日方之疑、郭代表對之、因此舉關於我國主權、仍表示堅决拒絕、且重復聲明、在協定原則第一條上、並無此項規定、何况此次討論、係屬停戰撤兵、絕非預備戰爭、假如當日軍撤退時、發生意外、則各友邦代表、儘可加以證明乎、此時日代表對於此點、仍堅持不稍讓步、謂華方代表如果不說明蘇州河南及浦東之情况、則日軍雖願誠意撤退、仍不能達到完全停戰之目的、郭代表聆言、乃謂日代表及各友邦代表曰、欲達完全停戰之目的乎、此極易、祗須日軍恢復一月念八日前之原狀可耳、中國方面、此次參加會議、完全根據國聯議决案、與中日雙方之停戰協定、須知停</p>
<p>戰與撤兵、完全相互而行、停戰既已通過、則最緊要之問題、端在完全撤兵、在協定第三條内、並明確規定、日軍須撤退至一月念八日前之原防、惟當時中國因日方屢次要求、謂實因人數過多之故、暫時准許日軍駐紮於租界毘連地帶、今日方對此、非特毫無誠意、抑且節外生枝、牽涉他項問題、而於撤兵談判、迄無明確規定、是誠令人失望、郭代表言竟、時已正午十二時、各友邦代表、見雙方爭執、迄未稍止、而日方亦覺難以下台、乃自動表示將蘇州河南及浦東之駐軍問題、交小組軍事委員會討論、是否於日軍撤退時、有威脅之可能、小組委員會討論而後、如再不决、再交大會討論、當時日代表提出此項表示後、各友邦代表、俱表同意、吾方郭外次、當即聲明、在原則與事實上、不願討論此項問題、然以尊重各友邦公意、此項提議、可予贊同、惟須不越原則範圍爲主、至此、已十二時二十分、會議乃告完竣、定下午三時、繼續討論撤兵時間問題、</p>
<h3>下午會議詳情</h3>
<p>下午三時、中日雙方代表暨各友邦代表、繼續商洽停戰撤兵問題、首先發言者、仍爲日方代表、日代表謂、當第十一次會議時、日方曾提一聲明書、當時中國方面、因内容空洞、並無確定日期、加以反對、且爭執甚烈、旋由英使調解、雙方將此項問題、請示本國政府、而後再行討論、當時中國方面、仍因此項聲明書、以屬日方提出、不允請示、終以各友邦之婉勸、表示容納、故日方對撤兵談判關於協定第三條附件第二項之須先行詢問中國方面之訓令、已否接到、郭代表見詢乃謂當上次會議時、中國代表、對於日代表所提之聲明書、即已表示、在形式與内容、俱屬不滿、當時因各友邦婉勸、故即請示政府、今中國政府、回訓業經到達、不但對此不滿之意見、與本代表等相同、且以爲聲明書中所謂「視地方情形僑民安全」兩語涉及政治問題、今日所討論者爲停戰撤兵會議、並非政治談判、聲明書中所謂安全、係中國之内政問題、當中日雙方簽訂停戰協定之預備會時、中日雙方代表、均謂在所訂三項停戰撤兵之原則外、絕對不談任何政治問題、當時各友邦代表、亦均在塲、故今日會議、此項問題、可以不必討論、祗須規定一日軍完全撤退之時期、便可圓滿結束、日代表聆言、復謂此次日方出兵、完全爲保護僑民、如不達保僑目的、僑民仍不安全、則日軍殊難撤退、郭代表乃即加以駁覆、謂日方此語、又屬政治問題、既背國聯决議案之原則、復越停戰協定之範圍、故中國方面、决計拒絕討論、雙方至此、業已完全破裂、英使藍溥森氏、目覩此項象、深覺停戰會議、行將功敗垂成、乃與中立國代表商洽後、向中日雙方代表、提出一建議、謂此次停戰會議、實爲全世界所屬目、殊不願陷於僵局、此際惟有三項辦法、㈠在日方聲明書内、規定一完全撤退之日期、㈡華方暫時接受此項聲明、而加以保留、㈢會議即此破裂、即行散會、英藍使語竟、仍向中日雙方代表、積極斡旋、我方郭代表、因謂此項會議、本人尙有一辦法、蓋此項會議係屬根據國聯决議案而開、今日方不澈底之撤兵、則不妨將此次會議經過、詳細報告國聯大會、一方面各友邦亦可作一詳細報告、郭氏語竟、全室異常沉寂、時已下午四時十分、良久尙無人發言、郭氏乃又復謂、如欲打開僵局、必須有一新方法、中國政府、對會議態度、累次明白表示、根據協定、决不讓步、而此次會議經過、中國代表之一切發言、各友邦亦均明瞭、日兵而撤至中途而廢、無論如何、中國决不讓步者也、郭氏言竟、全室又復默然、達半小時之久、各友邦代表乃謂、觀此情形、勢將决裂、本人等承政府命令、斡旋中日和平、今乃如此、殊屬失望、務請兩方於無辦法中、想一辦法、吾方郭代表、乃以極堅决之論調、答之曰、欲使本會圓滿解决、此極簡單、祗須日方表示日軍能於何日撤退完竣、僅此一言、便可决定、英藍使此際、乃復謂、此項會議、迄今已達十餘次、世界人士、俱欲知會議之内容、現雖已至决裂之境、本人等仍須積極設法、日使重光聆言、乃謂對此情形、殊覺抱歉、而各友邦代表、亦表示今日散會後、仍請兩方報告政府、以便轉圓、並向中日雙方聲明、全世界現均集中視線於本會、如果决裂、不但中日兩國、受其影響、即各國在華之市塲、亦將危險、務請兩國對此嚴重注意、知解决停戰撤兵之必要、郭代表聆語、乃作最後之答辭、曰吾人已明知此病人之病勢、已入膏盲、諸醫均已束手、但不妨再易一醫、爲之設法診治、語竟、出席代表均失笑、時適下午六時、乃即散會、定星期六下午三時、重行討論、</p>

<p>工友拘捕　前日（五日）下午十二時許、該報職員熊少豪·汪英賓·蔣介民·陳希濤等、因欲離間工人團結、並實施威嚇手段計、竟擅自拘捕該報離館工人馬德仁吳妙生胡琬沈根生張文全王克剛陳士相朱祖興等八人、藏匿於該館會客室、威脅利誘、雙管齊下、該報工人絕不爲動、迨至次晨十一時始行釋放、</p>

<h3>記如臯一血案</h3>
<p>— 魯顰</p>
<p>如臯惡妻殺妾案。喧騰滬上。報紙且不惜以記載抗日血戰之寳貴篇幅刋登之。與香港馮德謙案。杭州劉夢瑩案同爲人所注意。近且剖腹取嬰。官廳力圖昭雪。茲將本案前後及社會所聞。略誌以告讀者。</p>
<p>本案非關妒愛。絕非三角關係所演成之血案。特不過一曲折之謀財害命耳。蓋案之起因。多分由於社會關係。徐成玉之娶妾。實系於無後爲大之「宗法觀念」。徐妻及徐姪之殺妾。乃由於「遺產承繼問題」。在農村社會之如臯鄉間。竟演出如許之鉅案者。無非錢之作祟。惟徐田不過百畝。在鄉雖曰小康。估計實不足萬金。此攘彼奪。又何苦來。</p>
<p>本案之暴發。由於鄰居不平之告發。此點在普通之刑案上不甚常見。但鄰里不平之原因。亦有原來。蓋如臯有一種特殊人物。藉訟爲活。鼎革後此風亦未稍殺。且多播揚風聲。以經手賄賂爲榮耀。此事發生後。尸父初曾告發。不久即行中止。蓋訟棍某某已經手了結。并對徐云。曾以千元了衙門。（即賄賂之意）。道路傳說。謠言以息。里之强項者乃奮爲舉發。並具結以堅信認。於是案遂大白。</p>
<p>綜以上之觀察。實足證明最近三血案之背景互異。杭州之劉案。乃智識界之一種糾紛。香港馮案。乃資產階級之一幅悲劇。至若如臯徐案。特不過農村社會所造成之禍孽。又豈一例看哉。</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器㈡</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>步槍</p>
<p>今日步兵騎兵所用的火力兵器中最主要的。就槍一類而言。有步槍機關槍擲射器等。步槍的發明。是十三世紀。我蒙古軍遠征歐洲而創造的。不過當時的步槍。使用火藥鐵珠。裝置極爲滯鈍。且僅能在五十步以内射擊。據說帖木爾征伐倭寇。就用這利器以取勝。（考日本史上所謂文永的戰役。蒙古軍使用鐵槍以勝我。）後來比利時也發明了引鐵製造的步槍。就是把蒙古軍的槍。加以改良而成的。當時稱謂火繩槍。Fir-Lock但是日本起初所用的槍。本來是我國輸入。因爲查考他們的歷史。在足利將軍義滿時代。有中國人渡海呈獻鐵槍兩支等語。到了一六四○年。法國發明了燧石擊發機與槍劍。Bayonet於是火繩槍。遂失其效用了。自此以後。漸次由單發槍變爲連發槍。Magazine-Rifle這回日本在滬戰使用的步槍。照十九路軍所收繳的而言。是一種自動三八式步槍馬槍。與四一式的馬槍。這類步槍。所裝置的眼鏡瞄準器。Fore-Sight發射時。頗爲精確。所用彈丸。有曳光彈。徹甲彈數種。還有英國製造的Rythason式自動步槍。尤爲靈巧。這種自動步槍的槍口口徑。Muzzle約七耗。發射連發。在一分間。可射二五至五○發。能達一千米突以上的距離。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（二八）</h3>

<p>第四回婚約逼人來游移自擾　宼氛掠地去釁始重開在那極度的歡欣鼓舞之下。好似眼前已正開著一朶燦爛之花。轉瞬間那花朶兒越開越大。從花蕊中間又幻成個快樂的世界。幸福的家庭。是專爲伊二人預備著。正歡迎伊們雙雙携手大踏步走向那裏面去。作一對人間所少有的神仙眷屬。於是眼前的一切。以及憧憬中未來的一切。都眞是美滿極了。高超極了。直樂得伊飄飄欲仙。如痴如醉。在討論完那些瑣瑣碎碎的問題以後。還自精神優越。興致冲冲。特爲使出些女性們慰安男子和治家理事的本能。很麻俐的親手替安玉田收拾一回那間很凌亂蕪雜的屋子書案上那些亂抛得一天世界的線裝書和洋裝書。各歸其類的全一疊疊堆置好。另打開幾個抽屜。將一些舊信件和零碎紙條。一大把的抓出來塞在桌底下字紙簍裏。又拈著個雞毛撢子。到處拍拍聲的撢郤所有器具上堆積的灰塵。當伊這樣似一頭啣泥燕子。在屋裏飛來掠去。工作得忙亂不休�</p>
<p>時。還時時指點著向安玉田微笑道你瞧。你多麽媽糊。單單一間屋子。自己都懶得整理。我郤看不慣這骯髒雜亂。今晚姑且隨便拾作一下。改天頂好再呌個茶房來。由我監督著通通刷洗掃除一個乾凈。究竟弄淸爽一些。人住在裏面總舒適得多。安玉田一面說好。一面稱謝。又一面跟著伊脚後跟團團亂。轉也順手帮一點兒忙。趁伊一時眼裏没多留神。冷不防招過那個招惹是非的金盒子。悄悄塞到書桌抽屜内一個信箋紙匣下面。幸喜伊已不在意往後也再没問題。收拾一徧之後。·大概伊也有些疲乏了。失神似的立在屋中間。將下顆打圈似的晃了一下。把前額邊披散的短髮。拂轉到兩邊去。又把一雙玉手叉在纖腰下。再骨溜骨溜的轉動著秋波。向滿室裏重觀察過仔細。忽發現著他床上也太不淸潔。還不能認爲滿意。便又說道。索興連你這床。我也替你整理整理罷。有乾凈枕頭套和被單。拿出來我與你換一換。似這種極親切的關顧。那直是眼前就要試行伊爲人妻的責任内閣制的職務。并藉似昭示伊的慧心妙腕。是准能把一個做丈夫的服侍照料得非常之好。使他領略到這點好處。當愈益感覺那成家授室實有重大的需要。而促進婚事的實現。</p>

<p>「談言」</p>
<h3>命名說</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>太史公曰「天道恢恢，豈不大哉，談言微中，亦可以解紛·」這幾句原是太史公滑稽列傳中語，我今天引這四句書來，無非斷章取義，欲借重「談言」二字，以粉飾敝報的本埠增刋·</p>
<p>本刋中的文字，大抵寓着滑稽的意趣，原不能當正經正史看，也不能當作各大報「時評」「論壇」等類文字看，這一點不佞在本埠增刋中曾經一度聲明過的·今天要將本埠增刋中第一類題目，改一個名字·因爲從前的題目「小論壇」三字。不好·未免太莊·後改「隨便談談」四字，也不好，未免太無意義·</p>
<p>現在想起了這四句老古董，就是要借重「談言微中亦可解紛」的意義，然而這個名字，取雖取了，但是種種困難問題，便因此跟着發生·</p>
<p>第一個難題，就是談言是否能微中，不中便怎樣·</p>
<p>第二個難題，是否可以解紛，倘不能解紛，又便怎樣</p>
<p>就以上兩個難題，我想了半天，難以解决，又要替他更取一個名字，但想來想去，找不到一個比較更適當的題目，没有辦法，最後就在方寸靈臺上，把這名字，從多數贊成的形式裏通過了，議决之後，居然就在本刋上今天宣布出來了·</p>
<p>但是以上兩個難題，如何解决呢？其實以上兩個難題，解决亦並不十分困難，因爲第一個難題，是在我的·第二個難題，是在人的·在我的呢？無論如何困難問題，照我們的觀察，憑我們的腦筋，就用得·着一句古話，所謂「愚夫手慮必有一得·」并且他說談言微中的微字，原有兩種意義·一種是祗要微中，不必盡中·一種是祗要隱微的中，不必顯著的中·一種意義是從數上的講，一個意義是從質上的講·解說很寛，或者還可效力·</p>
<p>若第二難題，既不在我，天然我們没有强制他人服從與執行的力量·我們只有看其「芹暴」之獻，肯採納與不肯採納，其權盡操諸人·我們只有盡其在我者而已·至於在人，我别無他說，祇有「希望」二字奉告·</p>

<h3>溴</h3>
<p>— 徽</p>
<p>西曆一千八百二十六年，伯拉特氏（Balard)發見溴（Bromine）：因爲牠有一種剌激性的惡臭氣味，所以牠的英名即從希臘字惡臭（Stench）而來的·牠是八十五種元素中的一種，化學符號是Ｂr２，在平常溫度看上去，是一種暗褐色的液態，但元素中是液態的，祇有牠同水銀了，其他的元素則都是氣體或固體。</p>
<p>溴冷却到攝氏負七度（零度下面七度），則凝結成暗色的針狀結晶體，熱至攝氏六十度以上，則就沸騰而變成赤褐色的蒸氣。但在平常溫度，亦極容易發揮：使人嗅之，臭不可當。</p>
<p>溴的蒸氣很重的，倘拿數滴，滴在稍熱的燒瓶底上，就能夠氣化，變成赤褐色的烟，停在底部，倘不動牠，眞不容易昇到上面·牠溶解在水中，倒比較綠氣容易：並且混和得非常均匀；溶液就呌溴水（Watder　of　Bromine)：最濃的溴水，含到３％的溴。</p>
<p>溴的實騐室製法，與製綠氣一樣的，現在我拿化學方程式寫在下面：２Ｎa　Br　＋　2H2SO4＋MnO2↓溴化鈉　　　　　　　硫酸　　　　　二氣化錳Na2SO4　＋　MnSO4＋2H2O+Br2硫酸鈉　　　　　　　硫酸錳　　　永　　　　溴倘若祇要做少量的溴，則可用最普通的溴化鉀來代溴化鈉。　　工業上的製造法，則利用溴的化合力較綠氣薄弱，就用綠氣通進溴化鎂的水溶液中，趕出溴來，而綠氣與鎂化合成氯化鎂。</p>
<p>溴化鈉與溴化鎂是混在海水内，在德國的司丹福斯脫Stassfurt死海的鹽層中含得更多；所以溴的原料是天然的。近來美國製造溴出來。每年大約有到一百萬磅。</p>
<p>溴的用途很廣大，溴溶成的溴水，可以利用糧與輕氣化合的性而製造溴化氫，或做試藥。牠能夠腐蝕與剌激薄的黏膜，所以醫藥上用少量的溴，可以塗敷或吸進，治白喉痧的用，溴化物中的溴成分，能使神經鎭靜，故溴用來造這種樂料的，以溴化鉀爲最多。溴用來做染料Dyestuffs；並用可以製一種很和平的消毒藥。溴化銀的漿液，是塗在攝影的硬片與軟片上用的。</p>

<h3>後影</h3>
<p>— 丁奴</p>
<p>『劉先生,你這次遭難，伯受了不小的剌激罷』。</p>
<p>我帶着凄惶的眼光對他，他凄然良久，纔仰起帶着愁容的臉孔來，沉痛的答道，『啊，那不是嗎，···』剛要接着說下去時，却給震耳的砲聲打斷了，原來我們會面那天，英勇的十九路軍並不曾撤退，還在那裏沉着抵抗由矮宼方面打來的砲火，當下劉先生有點驚訝，怎麽這個位所也聽得這樣淸晰的砲聲，但我是聽慣的了。</p>
<p>停頓了一下，纔接下去說，『我這條老命還能夠保存，眞算幸運呢，當事變發作的那一晚，我們都還在寓所裏，半夜醒來，聽得隆隆的槍砲聲，便預備逃開，但都没有機會，一直等到天亮，乘着槍聲稍疎時，便踉蹌地走出門口，但走不上幾步，一個砲彈剛打中側旁的牆壁·一大塊灰牆登時崩塌下來，我嚇得倒退幾步，那灰牆就落下離我身邊不到一丈遠的地點，你看多麽危險啊』。</p>
<p>他說着猶有餘悸，從他的眼睛裏射出動蕩不安的淡光，我們都不約而同的嘆息了一聲，他接着又說道，『逃出來後，就在一位姓林的家裏住，一切被褥，身服，都向人家暫時借來用，弄到這樣狼藉的地步，眞夢想也不到的』。</p>
<p>到了前兩天，他又來到我的住所，頽唐消瘦，仍是不改老樣仔，坐下了一會，他從衣袋裏搜出一把焚毀了的鐵具，認眞的對我說，『我的一切都完了，這是我屋裏大門的鑰匙，昨天一位鄰居替我拾來的，二十多年的心血，只留這點點的紀念物，多傷心啊』。</p>
<p>劉先生是一位以研究南洋爲終身事業的人，平素所搜集關於南洋的書籍，珍品,不下數百種，而今都一一蕩然火葬了，眞是可惜。　　我說『敵人用心眞毒，這次事變，不管是私人的，抑是公共的文化機關，都摧殘殆盡，我們死了幾萬條生命，毀了幾百萬財產，都還不要緊，最要緊的，是把我們的文化機關毀滅，在我們文化落後的中國，這一個打擊是不能輕視的啊』。　　他點點頭拉長的說了一聲『是呀』。</p>
<p>接着我們又談了不少的話，他才告辭出走，在他走下樓梯時，我看着他的背影，彷彿仍是寳山路所常見的一樣。</p>

<h3>From Freedom of Speech to Freedom of Thought</h3>
<p>Regarding freedom of speech, we have already published a commentary titled "The True Meaning of Freedom of Speech" in November of last year. We believe that this is a sacred and inviolable right of the people, and the government should never impose any restrictions or interference. Now, we would like to go further and advocate for absolute freedom of thought.</p>
<p>The proposal of this argument may be seen by some as almost farcical, while others may see it as opening the floodgates, leading to a major crisis. The former believe that our individual, latent thoughts are inherently free and that no one can possibly restrict them. The latter, however, believe that society is already in turmoil, and to adopt an absolute laissez-faire attitude without proper precautions regarding thought is akin to adding fuel to the fire, which will only exacerbate the source of chaos. Both of these arguments, on the surface, may seem reasonable, but in reality, they are not.</p>
<p>We believe that the correct interpretation of freedom of thought is not the "latent" freedom of individual thought, but rather the freedom of "public expression" of individual thought. All people are born with brains, and where there is birth, there is thought. When we contemplate in silence, even to the ends of the earth, and fantasize about all things, no one can possibly know or restrain us. However, this is merely the freedom of a puppet. We believe that while actions should be bound by law, thought must be given the freedom of public expression, so that it can be communicated to others, stimulate social commentary and research, and be openly discussed. Only then does thought become meaningful and valuable. Today, we all possess this puppet-like, latent freedom of thought. But do we truly have the freedom of public expression of thought? This is one aspect of the true meaning that we must correctly identify before advocating for freedom of thought.</p>
<p>Secondly, our nation and our society are indeed mired in a state of turmoil and unrest. The thoughts of young people are indeed extremely complex and impure. However, this turbulent phenomenon is actually due to political chaos and socio-economic ruin, and not due to the agitation of complex thoughts. Moreover, it is precisely because of social unrest and the decline of people's livelihoods that those in power in politics are further imposing heavy shackles, preventing people from thinking when they have thoughts and from publicly expressing their views, unable to freely seek a way out. Resentment and frustration accumulate, which is enough to drive them to take risks in the pursuit of satisfaction. This is like building a dam to prevent flooding, which may seem to prevent disaster for a time, but when the torrents surge, the dam will eventually collapse and be beyond repair. It would be better to remove the dam and open up more waterways, allowing the water to find its level and flow freely, so as not to be stirred into a towering wave. This is another aspect of the advantages and disadvantages that we must clearly identify before advocating for freedom of thought.</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang came to power, it has vigorously implemented party rule. All administrative affairs are premised on "party indoctrination," and the people's thoughts and speech are generally shackled. Especially since the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), restrictions on thought and speech have become even stricter. Any other theories or ideologies that differ from the Kuomintang's ideology and position are not only absolutely forbidden from spreading, but also absolutely prevented from being studied. Over the years, countless young people have been ruined by this. We sincerely do not know whether the authorities have ever conducted in-depth research on this type of restriction in terms of legal principles, nor do we know whether the authorities can be sure that this type of restriction is sufficient to suppress the people's irrepressible tide of thought.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Conference Continues</h3>
<p>No Results from Discussions on Troop Withdrawal Deadline. British Ambassador Proposes Three Compromise Measures. The General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene the ceasefire conference tomorrow afternoon. Two meetings were held yesterday morning and afternoon at the British Consulate General. The attending representatives were the same as before. On the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, both China and Japan persisted in their positions. British Minister Lampson proposed three compromise measures in an attempt to break the deadlock. Chinese and Japanese representatives agreed to consult their respective governments. The meeting is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow, Saturday, at 3:00 PM to continue discussions. The military subcommittee's representatives inspected Wusong yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and scheduled another meeting for this morning to discuss the issue of the Japanese troop's redeployment location.</p>
<h3>Morning Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the representatives of the Chinese and Japanese ceasefire conference, as well as the ministers and counselors of various friendly nations, attended on time. Before the meeting, the representatives of the subcommittee first reported on the previous day's resolutions and the scheduled inspection of the front lines at 2:00 PM. The Chinese and Japanese representatives had no objections to the report and then began discussions. However, the subcommittee representatives had to leave early at 11:40 AM to inspect the troop withdrawal locations at 2:00 PM. When the two sides began discussing yesterday morning, the Japanese Chief Delegate Ueda first questioned the Chinese representative, saying that regarding the deployment of Chinese troops in the area south of the Suzhou Creek and Pudong, the Japanese side was basing its position on Article 1 of the ceasefire agreement, which must include the cessation of all hostile actions by both armies. Therefore, the Japanese side not only needed to understand the status of troop deployments south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong, but also needed to understand the military actions within Chinese territory in principle. Therefore, the Japanese side must demand that the Chinese representative explain the troop deployment situation south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong. The Chinese Chief Delegate Guo Wai-ci, after hearing this, immediately and firmly stated that at the previous meeting, China had already clearly stated on this point that in fact, even during the period of hostilities, Chinese troops could use these two locations to attack Japanese troops. However, at that time, the Chinese troops' resistance against the Japanese troops was purely for self-defense. Since neither of the two locations had been attacked by Japanese troops, they had also not attacked Japanese troops. This could be seen even during the period of hostilities that the Chinese army was unwilling to make the areas south of the Suzhou Creek and Pudong into areas for attacking the Japanese army, especially during this ceasefire and troop withdrawal period. Moreover, in principle, there was no provision to discuss this issue in the agreement, and from the perspective of Chinese sovereignty, outside parties should absolutely not interfere in the actions of Chinese troops within Chinese territory. The Japanese side's inquiry was in fact a new issue that went beyond the principles of the agreement. The previously signed ceasefire agreement originally referred to troops involved in combat and areas that had become war zones, and absolutely did not involve other areas. In principle, this was already obvious, so there was no need for unnecessary discussions, especially since the locations referred to by the Japanese side were separated by the Public Concession and the French Concession. After hearing this, the Japanese representative replied with arguments, saying that the deployment of troops south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong had already been discussed many times. Did the Chinese side ultimately acknowledge that the above two locations were included within Article 1 of the agreement? When the Japanese representative spoke, the tone was particularly harsh. The Chinese representative Guo also replied with a concise argument, saying that this discussion was not originally within the scope, because the scope of the agreement was limited to those who had participated in the war and related matters. The above two locations were not related to this war. At this time, the attitudes of both sides were extremely serious. Seeing this situation, the representatives of various friendly nations were afraid of a breakdown and gently advised the Chinese representative, saying that China originally had no troops deployed south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong, so it would not hurt to explain this to dispel the Japanese side's suspicions. The Chinese representative Guo responded to this, still firmly refusing because this matter concerned Chinese sovereignty, and repeatedly stated that there was no such provision in Article 1 of the agreement. Moreover, this discussion was for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and was by no means preparing for war. If an accident occurred when the Japanese troops withdrew, the representatives of the various friendly nations could provide evidence. At this time, the Japanese representative still insisted and refused to yield on this point, saying that if the Chinese representative did not explain the situation south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong, then even if the Japanese troops were willing to withdraw in good faith, they would still not be able to achieve the goal of a complete ceasefire. After hearing this, the Chinese representative Guo said to the Japanese representative and the representatives of the various friendly nations, "Do you want to achieve the goal of a complete ceasefire? This is extremely easy. You only need to restore the situation before January 28th." The Chinese side's participation in this conference was entirely based on the League of Nations' resolution and the ceasefire agreement between China and Japan. It should be known that the ceasefire and troop withdrawal are completely intertwined. Since the ceasefire has already been agreed upon, the most important issue lies in the complete troop withdrawal. Article 3 of the agreement clearly stipulates that the Japanese troops must withdraw to their original positions before January 28th. However, at that time, China temporarily permitted the Japanese troops to be stationed in the area adjacent to the concession due to repeated requests from the Japanese side, who said that it was because of the excessive number of troops. Today, the Japanese side not only lacks sincerity on this matter, but also raises extraneous issues, involving other matters, and has not yet made a clear stipulation on the troop withdrawal negotiations, which is truly disappointing. After the Chinese representative Guo finished speaking, it was already 12:00 noon. Seeing that the dispute between the two sides had not stopped, and that it was difficult for the Japanese side to back down, the representatives of the various friendly nations automatically proposed that the issue of troop deployment south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong be handed over to the military subcommittee for discussion, to see whether there was a possibility of a threat when the Japanese troops withdrew. If the subcommittee could not reach a decision, it would be handed over to the General Assembly for discussion. At that time, after the Japanese representative made this proposal, the representatives of the various friendly nations all expressed their agreement. The Chinese representative Guo Wai-ci immediately stated that in principle and in fact, he was unwilling to discuss this issue, but out of respect for the common will of the various friendly nations, this proposal could be endorsed, provided that it did not exceed the scope of the principles. By this point, it was already 12:20 PM, and the meeting was adjourned. It was decided to continue discussing the issue of the troop withdrawal time at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Detailed Afternoon Meeting</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the representatives of China and Japan and the representatives of various friendly nations continued to discuss the issue of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal. The first to speak was still the Japanese representative. The Japanese representative said that at the 11th meeting, the Japanese side had submitted a statement. At that time, the Chinese side opposed it because the content was empty and did not have a definite date, and the dispute was very fierce. Then, the British ambassador mediated, and both sides asked their respective governments about this issue before discussing it again. At that time, the Chinese side still did not agree to ask for instructions on this statement because it was proposed by the Japanese side. Ultimately, with the gentle persuasion of various friendly nations, it was accepted. Therefore, the Japanese side asked whether the instruction to first consult with the Chinese side regarding the second item of the annex to Article 3 of the agreement on troop withdrawal negotiations had been received. The Chinese representative Guo, after being asked, said that at the previous meeting, the Chinese representative had already expressed dissatisfaction with the statement submitted by the Japanese representative in terms of both form and content. At that time, due to the gentle persuasion of various friendly nations, instructions were requested from the government. Now, the reply from the Chinese government has arrived. Not only is the opinion of dissatisfaction with this the same as that of the representatives, but it is also believed that the so-called "local conditions and the safety of residents" in the statement involve political issues. What is being discussed today is a ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference, not political negotiations. The so-called safety in the statement is a matter of China's internal affairs. During the preparatory meeting for the signing of the ceasefire agreement between China and Japan, the representatives of both sides stated that no political issues would be discussed outside of the three principles of ceasefire and troop withdrawal. At that time, the representatives of various friendly nations were also present. Therefore, this issue does not need to be discussed at today's meeting. It will be possible to conclude satisfactorily only by stipulating a date for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. After hearing this, the Japanese representative replied again, saying that the Japanese side's dispatch of troops this time was entirely to protect residents. If the goal of protecting residents is not achieved and the residents are still not safe, then it will be difficult for the Japanese troops to withdraw. The Chinese representative immediately refuted this, saying that the Japanese side's statement was again a political issue, which not only violated the principles of the League of Nations resolution, but also went beyond the scope of the ceasefire agreement. Therefore, the Chinese side resolutely refused to discuss it. At this point, the two sides had already completely broken down. British Ambassador Lampson, seeing this situation, deeply felt that the ceasefire conference was about to fail. After discussing with the representatives of neutral countries, he proposed a suggestion to the representatives of China and Japan, saying that this ceasefire conference was being watched by the entire world, and he did not want it to fall into a deadlock. At this time, there were only three options: (1) The Japanese side should issue a separate declaration, the wording of which would be that the Japanese troops hope to completely withdraw within six months when the local conditions have progressed to ensure safety; (2) China and Japan should issue a joint declaration, that is, add a supplementary statement from our side after the Japanese declaration, the wording of which would be that China believes that this agreement has not been fulfilled until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn; (3) The meeting will break down and adjourn immediately. After the British ambassador finished speaking, he actively mediated between the representatives of China and Japan. The Chinese representative Guo said that he still had a solution for this meeting, because this meeting was being held based on the League of Nations resolution. If the Japanese side did not thoroughly withdraw its troops, then it would be possible to report the details of this meeting to the League of Nations General Assembly. On the one hand, the various friendly nations could also make a detailed report. After Guo finished speaking, the entire room was unusually silent. It was already 4:10 PM, and no one had spoken for a long time. Guo then said again that if the deadlock was to be broken, there must be a new method. The Chinese government had repeatedly made it clear that it would not compromise based on the agreement. The Chinese representative's speeches at this meeting were also clear to the various friendly nations. If the Japanese troops were to withdraw halfway, China would never compromise, no matter what. After Guo finished speaking, the entire room was silent again for half an hour. The representatives of the various friendly nations then said that, judging from this situation, a breakdown was inevitable. They had been ordered by their governments to mediate peace between China and Japan, but now it was like this, which was truly disappointing. They urged both sides to think of a way out when there was no way out. The Chinese representative Guo replied with an extremely firm tone, saying that to resolve this meeting satisfactorily, it was extremely simple. The Japanese side only needed to indicate on what date the Japanese troops could be completely withdrawn. This one sentence would be enough to decide. At this time, British Ambassador Lampson said again that this meeting had been held more than a dozen times so far, and people around the world wanted to know the content of the meeting. Although it had reached the point of breakdown, he still had to actively find a way. The Japanese Minister Shigemitsu, after hearing this, said that he felt very sorry for this situation, and the representatives of the various friendly nations also said that after today's adjournment, they would still ask both sides to report to their governments in order to facilitate mediation, and declared to both China and Japan that the whole world was now focused on this meeting. If it broke down, not only would China and Japan be affected, but the markets of various countries in China would also be in danger. They urged both countries to pay serious attention to this, knowing the necessity of resolving the ceasefire and troop withdrawal. The Chinese representative Guo, after hearing this, made a final reply, saying that he already knew that the patient's condition had reached the point of no return, and all the doctors had given up, but it would not hurt to change another doctor to find a way to diagnose and treat him. After he finished speaking, all the attending representatives laughed. It was exactly 6:00 PM, and they adjourned the meeting, scheduling it to resume discussions on Saturday afternoon at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador's Compromise Measures</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, this reporter learned last night that the three compromise measures proposed by the British ambassador regarding the issue of the final troop withdrawal deadline were as follows: (1) The Japanese side should issue a separate declaration, the wording of which would be that the Japanese troops hope to completely withdraw within six months when the local conditions have progressed to ensure safety; (2) China and Japan should issue a joint declaration, that is, add a supplementary statement from our side after the Japanese declaration, the wording of which would be that China believes that this agreement has not been fulfilled until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn; (3) Our side should issue a separate declaration, the wording of which would be that China believes that the spirit of the League of Nations resolution and this agreement have not been fulfilled until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn to the Public Concession and the extra-mural roads in the Hongkou area. Both China and Japan are seeking instructions from their governments on the three mediation measures proposed by the British ambassador.</p>
<h3>Communiqués of the Two Meetings</h3>
<p>Last night's meeting communiqué stated that a meeting was held on the morning of April 7th to discuss the issue of the final troop withdrawal deadline. As a result, both sides asked their respective governments for instructions and scheduled a meeting to continue on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Wusong</h3>
<p>The entire committee of the military subcommittee departed from the British Consulate General at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to inspect Wusong. They arrived at Wusong at 2:40 PM. All the committee members disembarked near the Seaside Hotel and walked westward, passing through the Central University Medical College and Tongji University in a line, inspecting along the line to the Japanese-Chinese Sugar Factory, and then turned to Wusong Town. At 4:50 PM, they returned to Shanghai by car. The subcommittee has reportedly scheduled another meeting for 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>News from London</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, April 6th: According to reliable sources from Shanghai, the Sino-Japanese negotiations are progressing smoothly, and an agreement is about to be reached. The Shanghai intelligence appreciates the efforts of the foreign observers and especially praises British Ambassador Lampson for his tireless efforts to mediate. It is believed that although the date for the Japanese troop withdrawal has been mentioned, it probably does not involve withdrawing into the concession.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Frontline Military News</h3>

<h3>Yen Hui-ching Submits Official Documents to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Protesting the Establishment of Illegal Government by Japanese in Northeast Reuters, Geneva, April 6: The Chinese delegation here is now very active. Dr. Yen today sent three official documents to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. One of the documents included a telegram from public organizations in Chahar Province protesting the establishment of an illegal government by the Japanese in the three northeastern provinces as a step towards future annexation and requesting the League of Nations to uphold justice for China, restore Chinese sovereignty, and maintain the dignity of the League of Nations charter and international instruments of peace. The other two documents concerned the dropping of bombs by Japanese aircraft in Anting and the increase of Japanese troops by 4,000 in Huangdu, destroying public property and seizing goods. The Chinese representative's documents also mentioned the report of Shanghai Mayor Wu on April 4th, which stated that the Japanese had established a political affairs office in Zhabei, arbitrarily appointed Chinese to important positions, and organized a police force.</p>
<h3>US Senator's Proposal on Those Who Violate Covenants</h3>
<p>Implement Commercial Boycott Reuters, Washington, April 7: Senator Keebler today proposed in the Senate a bill to impose commercial boycotts on those who violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<h3>Illegal Organization in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening News Condemns it as a Chinese Rebel Group The Greater Shanghai Evening News writes: Shanghai will now have a Siamese government under the protection and guidance of the Japanese army. The Japanese naval landing party and the Japanese army naturally believe that they are not responsible for this newly organized Chinese committee that usurps the administrative power of Zhabei. The facts are as follows: The Shanghai municipal government, which is controlled by the Nanjing central government and opposes being responsible to the central government, participated in the official Shanghai case meetings held with Japanese diplomatic and military representatives. The government applied to the Japanese authorities for permission to resume work in the area withdrawn by the Chinese army and promised to be responsible for protecting the lives and property of the people and maintaining law and order, but was rejected by the Japanese authorities. The reason for the rejection was that the Japanese army could properly manage the area at this moment. Now, someone has suddenly organized an illegal government in the area and obtained the permission of the Japanese authorities to entrust the ordinary duties of maintaining law and order to the government. Today, the civilians who return to the area cannot even obtain the protection of the Japanese army occupying the area, but must be approved by the illegal administrators before they can manage their old businesses. These illegal administrators will not be responsible to anyone, but only to themselves or the Japanese authorities. Since the issue of responsibility has no basis, this move can be described as an extremely illegal crime committed by the Chinese rebel party in the occupied area. The party has done this in order to avoid being bound by law. Although there are a few Japanese residents in the area, since the Japanese army is stationed there, the Japanese residents can be protected by it. However, Chinese civilians have to be subject to the arbitrary illegal committee that holds power. The Japanese often claim that their operations are for the sake of law, order, peace and security. I wonder if this illegal committee is an example of their so-called law, order, peace and security.</p>
<h3>Aizawa Discusses Attitude Towards Pseudo-State</h3>
<p>Blames Shanghai Case as Forced Action Reuters, Paris, April 7 The Paris Daily published a conversation with the Japanese Foreign Minister Aizawa by the newspaper's Tokyo correspondent this morning, explaining Japan's attitude toward the newly established Manchuria and its government. Aizawa first stated that the claim that Japan has decided to withdraw from the League of Nations is incorrect, and that Japan has not yet had the problem of recognizing the new Manchuria. Matters must be determined in light of the environment and the intelligence and stability demonstrated by the new country. Manchuria is a completely independent new country established on the principle of self-determination. If the new country respects existing treaties, Japan is determined to maintain it by all means. Aizawa also said that the loans borrowed by the new country were not provided by the Japanese government, but were borrowed by the Mitsui and Mitsubishi banks. Japan's relationship with Manchuria will obviously become closer. Japan will never abandon its huge interests in Manchuria, nor will it abandon its residents there. Japan must maintain the results it has obtained by sacrificing blood, energy, and money. Japanese people feel unanimously about this. Aizawa continued to mention the Shanghai incident, saying that the Shanghai incident was very unfortunate. Japan did not want to conquer Chinese land, but as far as the Shanghai case is concerned, the Japanese were forced to act by all kinds of troublesome events.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance's Plan to Reduce Debt Interest for Domestic Bondholders</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the city's commerce has been affected by the war, and the financial situation has become extremely tight. The prices of various government bonds have fallen sharply. The Association of Domestic Public Bondholders of the Republic of China, recognizing this situation, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on the 26th of this month. They voluntarily proposed to postpone or reduce the interest rates on various government bonds to one-half as a principle, to serve as a long-term resistance backing for the government. The due principal and interest would be allocated from customs duties. The surplus funds from cigarette tax and special tax would be used for government military and political expenses. Yesterday, the association received a reply from Finance Minister Song Ziwen, stating: "Regarding your express mail and telegram of February 26th, along with the declaration, draft plan, and draft conditions of the National Debt Fund Management Committee, all have been received. Your patriotism and willingness to act bravely are deeply admired. Upon review, the draft plan includes: 1. The monthly allocated fund should not be less than half of the current allocated principal and interest, which is 8.6 million yuan per month. 2. Various treasury bills will be repaid at half of the original monthly principal repayment amount. The interest will be calculated at 5% per month (e.g., if the remaining amount of the February salt tax treasury bill is 94 yuan, the original principal and interest due is 1 yuan and 7.5 jiao. Now, half of that is 5 jiao. The monthly interest at 5% is 4.7 jiao, totaling 9.7 jiao, which is approximately 56% of the original amount. The remaining amounts will be calculated similarly), extending the repayment period. In other words, what used to be 20 yuan repaid in 20 months will now be 20 yuan repaid in 40 months. However, within four years, if the total monthly fund of 8.6 million yuan is not enough to cover 50% of the original principal and interest, as well as the monthly interest of 5%, the principal will be reduced appropriately, but to no less than 40% of the original amount. After four years, the monthly fund of 8.6 million yuan will be allocated annually, increasing gradually, and not limited to 50%, so that the debt can be repaid as soon as possible. 3. All public bonds, except for the whole series of 6 and 7 spring festival security bonds, will be converted to an annual interest rate of 6%, extending the repayment period and changing to a lottery drawing every three months. After four years, the monthly fund of 8.6 million yuan will be allocated together with the various treasury bills mentioned in the previous article, increasing annually, so that the debt can be repaid as soon as possible. 4. The whole series of 6 and 7 security, spring festival, 17-year financial long-term six public bonds, except for the original annual interest rate of 6% for whole series 6 and 2.5% for financial long-term bonds, the remaining will be converted to an annual interest rate of 6%. The repayment of other financial short-term and financial long-term bonds will be handled according to the original plan. Only interest will be paid within the remaining four years. From the fifth year, the security bond will be repaid within three years, and the remaining bonds will be repaid within twelve years. 5. According to this extended term calculation standard, all funds freed up after the repayment of all bonds should be used to pay off the outstanding principal and interest of other bonds. A detailed table of principal and interest repayments will be announced separately. 6. Before the exchange of new bonds, the old bonds will remain valid, but principal and interest will be collected according to the new regulations. In the future, new bonds will be exchanged based on the standards stipulated in this article and other tables, calculated and exchanged in whole numbers. 7. The Fund Management Committee will be renamed the National Debt Management Committee, with the Director-General of Customs and the Customs Commissioner serving as ex officio members. The committee's regulations will be promulgated by the National Government. All funds due should be allocated directly by the Inspector General of Customs from the existing Boxer Indemnity and increased customs duties to the Fund Management Committee for its full management. If there is a shortfall, the government will designate a type of central tax to supplement the amount. The fund management regulations will be detailed separately by the Fund Management Committee. 8. Since the bondholders have sacrificed their personal interests for the sake of national crisis and sincerely supported the country, after this interest reduction and extension of principal, no matter how difficult the government's finances are, the fund will not be affected, and the set regulations will not be changed. The circumstances of this plan should be announced by the National Government and ordered to be permanently observed by the Executive Yuan, and filed in the Legislative Yuan, and ordered to the collection officials of the allocated fund and the Inspector General of Customs to allocate the total annual principal and interest of the bonds due in two installments on the 15th and 25th of each month until the principal and interest are repaid in full, in order to show great credibility. 9. The government and the people are closely related, and the finances should be thoroughly reorganized and completely transparent. The Finance Committee should be participated in by various groups, taking the principle of thrift. The current revenue scope should be a fixed budget and should not be exceeded in the slightest. 10. The government will no longer borrow from various commercial groups for internal wars and political expenses. 11. The exchange of old bonds for new bonds should be handled by a separate agency managed by the Fund Management Committee. The new bond regulations should be stipulated within the scope of the above articles and promulgated and implemented by the government as soon as possible. 12. Please request the government to allocate 500,000 yuan per month for the Shanghai War Relief Fund for a period of ten years. In the future, this fund will be used to issue public bonds for war relief to restore various businesses in the disaster-stricken areas. 13. The Ministry of Finance should allocate another fund within three years to repay the principal and interest of the 96 and Second Reorganization Bond. The method will be determined by the Ministry of Finance." The various measures proposed in the articles, such as reducing interest rates, extending repayment periods, and guaranteeing funds, have been promulgated by the National Government and should be respected and implemented. As for the regulations of the National Debt Management Committee, the Ministry has already submitted them to the government for approval and will be promulgated soon. In addition, all other articles will be handled according to the plan. Regarding the monthly allocation of funds in two installments, after consultation with the Inspector General of Customs, due to the relationship of foreign debt reparations, it is not possible to conclude every half month. Therefore, it should still be allocated on the 25th of each month as before. This is the actual situation and should be followed accordingly. Regarding the issuance of public bonds for the Shanghai War Relief, I also agree in principle. The detailed methods, total amount, and fund should be submitted to the government for approval. The reorganization of old debts should be handled together with the Committee for Reorganizing Domestic and Foreign Debts. This is a joint reply.</p>

<h3>Tram Lines 5, 6, and 3 Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tram Line 5 of the French Concession French Commercial Tram Company, running from Laoximen to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station, and Tram Line 6, running from Xieqiao to the 16th Dock, were blocked due to the tight closure of the Xiaobeimen iron gate after the January 28th Incident. Therefore, the routes were changed. Tram Line 5 ran from Xiaobeimen to the Haining Road intersection, and Tram Line 6 ran from Xiaobeimen to the 16th Dock. Tram Line 3, running on Minguo Road, was also suspended. It has been more than two months, and the losses have been significant. Now, the French authorities, in view of the gradually peaceful situation, have successively opened places such as the Nanyang Bridge to facilitate traffic. Yesterday at noon, workers were sent to remove the barbed wire and wooden stakes inside the Xiaobeimen iron gate. In an instant, the iron gate was opened. Around 1:30, both Tram Lines 5 and 6 went directly to Laoximen and Xieqiao. Later, at 3 o'clock, Tram Line 3, running on Minguo Road, was also dispatched by the company to run as usual. The general passengers were suddenly crowded, and everyone was very happy.</p>

<h3>The Jiangbei Canal Dike Will Soon Be Completed</h3>
<p>The World's Military Spending in Two Hours</p>
<p>If Transferred, It Could Build the Gaoyou Dike</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yinju Generously Donated 200,000 Yuan Alone</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Is Praiseworthy</p>
<p>China's canal connecting the north and south has been in disrepair for many years. Last summer's floods caused disasters. Six breaches occurred one after another in the canal dike near Gaoyou City. Fortunately, the local Chinese and Foreign Relief Association undertook the repair work as a fundamental relief measure. The canal dike breaches caused loss of life and homes, turning the Jiangbei area into a swamp. With no harvest and the water remaining for a long time, autumn wheat could not be replanted. The disaster was significant, causing famine. Therefore, foreign cooperative sub-associations had to be established in Taizhou, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Huai'an, Qingjiangpu, Yancheng, and Funing to carry out relief work. The results were very satisfactory. However, before the spring water rises, the river dike should be repaired immediately. Otherwise, the water in the Huai River Basin, with Jiangbei as the tail, will leave farmers with no hope of planting rice again in April and May. Therefore, the unanimous cry of the local farmers is, "If the breaches are blocked, the water will not invade us, and the autumn harvest will be abundant. Otherwise, the situation will become more and more serious, and we will have no food or clothing. How can we live?" Fortunately, Mr. Lin Yinju had compassion and generously donated 200,000 yuan alone for Jiangbei water conservancy. Such kindness and generosity, sacrificing oneself, benefited millions of people in Jiangbei. It is truly rare. Subsequently, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau sent personnel to conduct surveys near Gaoyou, and the provincial government authorities approved the project yesterday. The estimated cost is more than 400,000 yuan. The National Government Flood Relief Association approved the allocation of 2,000 tons of relief wheat to help its completion. The person in charge of the project is Mr. Wang Shuxiang, who is well-known in Jiangbei. The supervisor is Mr. He Bokui, an American pastor from the Taizhou Dongtai Presbyterian Church. Mr. He was the initiator of this project. With Mr. Wang undertaking the entire project, he personally planned everything. From the beginning to the completion of the work, he was tireless. The contributions of Mr. Wang and Mr. He are significant. They are truly the living Buddhas of thousands of families and are also appreciated by the members of the association. The association also formed a committee to repair the Gaoyou breach, with Song Hanzhang, Rao Jiaju, Gu Jisheng, Fei Wusheng, Zhu Yinjiang, and Huang Hanzhi serving as members. Mr. Song and Mr. Fei served as economic directors to jointly undertake this effort. The handling of the project and economic situation are described separately below.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Project</h3>
<p>The Dangjunlou breach is the largest, about 1,660 Chinese feet long. There is a deep pool at the breach, about 20 feet deep. The dike base must be built 148 feet. The Miaoxiangkou breach is about 640 Chinese feet long, with a base of 119 feet. The Ershilipu breach is 620 feet long, with a base of 133 feet. The Sanshilipu breach is 675 feet long. The remaining two breaches, one at Qigong Dike and one at Yumatou, are smaller in area, but because they are part of the construction line, their importance is no less than the other dikes. It is estimated that after completion, the dike will be about 20 feet high and 30 feet wide at the top. The soil is transported from outside the Bali Road. More than 10,000 to 12,000 workers are hired every day. In other words, including the workers' families, 50,000 people can make a living every day while the work is in progress. After the completion in April, these workers can return to their hometowns and live their agricultural lives.</p>
<h3>Strict Economy</h3>
<p>Payments are solemn and supervision is strict. No money will be wasted on anything other than the river dike project. Before each payment, the soil work is inspected to see if it is satisfactory. Mr. Wang and Mr. He cooperated closely, and they were able to handle any difficulties. According to the disaster victims, once the dike is completed, a good autumn harvest is expected, and the famine will not recur. This shows the importance of this project. However, the dike built by the association near Gaoyou is only part of the entire Jiangbei project undertaken by the provincial government. The association also fully cooperated with the provincial government authorities during the work. It is said that the world's military spending costs 60 yuan every second. According to this calculation, the world's military spending in two hours is 432,000 yuan, which can build the Gaoyou dike, allowing countless farmers and workers to live and work in peace and without the fear of famine. Heaven has the virtue of loving life, and it is only through human effort that we can quell the sword and summon peace. It depends on the thought of the benevolent. Those who pursue military force should be enlightened.</p>
<h3>Schools in the City Resume Classes</h3>
<p>Only Five Secondary Schools Have Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, schools in the city were either damaged by artillery fire in the war zone and unable to open, or temporarily suspended due to the dispersal of students. Afterwards, as the situation eased, all public and private secondary schools and above, except for Guangdong Junior High School, Lida Middle School, Qixiu Girls' Middle School, Dongwu No. 2 Middle School, and Pudong Middle School, which have not yet been able to open, have resumed classes as usual in schools that were not affected. Those whose school buildings were burned or destroyed have also moved to rented houses and opened classes separately. In terms of primary schools, except for schools in the war zone that have not yet recovered, the rest have already opened and resumed classes. Now, most schools at all levels have resumed and are continuing to teach.</p>
<h3>Business Employees Host the Press</h3>
<p>The National Society said that the Business Printing House Employees' Relief Committee hosted the local press yesterday (7th) afternoon at 3 o'clock at the New New Restaurant to report on the disputes between the employees and the capitalists of the museum. Representatives of reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and groups, and members of the Association, more than 100 people attended. First, Chairman Ge Hecai reported on the significance of the hosting and the hope that all sectors would uphold justice. Next, Association member Chen Jiaxuan reported, saying that when the Japanese soldiers invaded Zhabei this time, the museum was completely destroyed, and the losses were considerable. The capitalist then used the excuse that it could not be restored immediately and planned to dismiss all employees except for giving each person five days' salary and ten yuan for maintenance. All retirement salaries and savings deposits were not paid at all. This move was inconsistent with the museum's regulations. It is now heard that the museum still has more than 800,000 yuan in cash deposited in banks, while the more than 1,000 employees in Shanghai each require a mere 20 yuan. Although the Social Bureau has repeatedly mediated, negotiations have lasted for four weeks, but the capitalist, represented by Wang Yunwu, has never agreed. It is said that after Mr. Wang previously implemented scientific management methods and failed, he inevitably harbored resentment towards the employees, and this was the hand used. Association member Chen Dongwu then reported, saying that although the people of Shanghai know that the museum was destroyed and lost millions, the original capital of the museum was only 2.5 million yuan. Later, due to the efforts of colleagues, the annual surplus increased the share capital by one fold to 5 million yuan. What is this if not the blood and sweat of all our colleagues for 35 years? Although the museum has been destroyed, its existing assets, such as the branches in various places and the printing factories in Hong Kong and Peiping, are no less than 7 million yuan. It can be said that it is a loss, but if it is said that it is a loss, how can it be credible to the society? Now, the branches of the museum are still operating as usual, and the copyrights are all there, and it is entirely possible to proceed with restoration. How can we know that the capitalist does not plan for this, but unreasonably demands the dismissal of all employees. The employees who survived the disaster are displaced, and are in great distress. How can such an encounter be considered fair? Finally, Mai Chaochu, Pan Gongzhan, and others spoke one after another, and dispersed at 6 o'clock with tea and snacks.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at the Shishi Xinbao</h3>
<p>The Authorities of Three Newspapers Mediate and Resolve the Division</p>
<p>Various Industry Associations Send Letters of Condolence</p>
<p>The Press Trade Union Announces that the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao authorities recently (2nd) forced the workers of the museum to print the Da Wan Bao on their behalf, causing an uproar. This news was originally released the day before yesterday, but because the Association received a notice from the mediator, urging the news to be postponed, so it can only be disclosed today. The details are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident</p>
<p>The museum's workshop administration has always been managed by the Workshop Executive Committee. This time, in order to increase revenue, the museum forced the workers to also print the Da Wan Bao. The workers believed that this matter required an order from the trade union and did not agree. Museum staff Jiang Jiemin accused the workers of obstructing the museum's administration, and a dispute arose. At this time, Zhang Baokang, a member of the newspaper's trade union standing committee, came forward to mediate, but Jiang Jiemin scolded Zhang for inciting a strike and called the police to arrest him. After the workers' persuasion, he was not detained. Unexpectedly, that afternoon, all the workers were suddenly expelled from the museum and the gates were locked. On one side the police was reported and falsely accused the workers of striking. The workers, on the other hand, petitioned the trade union and reasoned with them. At present, both sides insist on not resolving the problem. This is where the storm arose.</p>
<p>Trade Union Attitude</p>
<p>After the newspaper's storm broke out, the standing committee of the Press Trade Union believed that the matter was significant and convened a joint meeting of the executive staff of various newspapers the day before yesterday, and decided to organize a special committee to deal with the Shishi Xinbao incident. Once the storm is over, this organization will be cancelled. All daily affairs of the Press Trade Union are still the responsibility of the Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Mediation Resolves Division</p>
<p>For days, the entanglements between the two sides have not been resolved. It is heard that the authorities of the three major newspapers are deeply concerned about the expansion of the situation, and they have taken on the role of mediator. The day before yesterday, they consulted with the Press Trade Union. According to the person in charge of the trade union, they do not want to make a big fuss, and only require that the museum have sincerity. The three newspaper authorities then presented mediation opinions to the Shishi Xinbao authorities, but the museum authorities shirked responsibility, so there was no way to mediate. Therefore, the museum's situation of shirking responsibility has been reported to the trade union. It is heard that the trade union has decided to deal with it with all its strength.</p>
<p>Workers Detained</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (5th) at 12 o'clock in the afternoon, Xiong Shaohao, Wang Yingbin, Jiang Jiemin, Chen Xitao, and other staff members of the newspaper, in order to alienate worker unity and implement threatening measures, arbitrarily detained Ma Deren, Wu Miaosheng, Hu Wan, Shen Gensheng, Zhang Wenquan, Wang Kegang, Chen Shixiang, Zhu Zuxing and other eight workers who had left the museum. They hid them in the museum's reception room and used threats and enticements to no avail. The newspaper's workers were not moved. They were released at eleven o'clock the next morning.</p>
<p>Condolences from All Sectors</p>
<p>Since the dispute occurred, the Trade Union Federation, Postal Service, Newspaper Delivery, and other trade unions have sent letters to the Press Trade Union for assistance or sent people to express their condolences, out of concern for each other. Excerpts from two letters are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Postal Trade Union (Omitted) Your Association's Shishi Xinbao workers were expelled by the capitalist for no reason and the workshop was locked down. Moreover, the dispute-resolving executive member appointed by your association was arbitrarily insulted. Upon hearing the news, our association was indignant. To act against public reason and insist on one's own way, and to put the workers' livelihoods in desperation, is intolerable. In order to uphold justice, our association expresses its full sympathy for the Shishi Xinbao workers who were forced to leave the museum and is willing to provide practical assistance (omitted below).</p>
<p>2.  All Sectors Workers Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association (Omitted above) Shishi Xinbao fellow workers, we have not yet fully understood the details of your oppression, so we cannot have very clear assistance methods. We have specially sent Jin, a representative of our association, to express our condolences and inquire about everything. At the same time, we offer our association's views on your fighting strategy. Our association's views (omitted in the middle) After obtaining the details, we will have concrete views to offer. We hope that all workers will fight firmly. Our association will lead the 30,000 members of the anti-Japanese sub-associations of all workers to be your backing (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Shanghai Newspaper Guild Manifesto</h3>
<p>To all oppressed compatriots throughout China regarding the Shishi Xinbao's lockout and expulsion of workers: The aggression and oppression of Japanese imperialism has not ceased, the bloodstains of "January 28th" have not dried, and while the entire nation is still shouting "unite against foreign aggression," unscrupulous capitalists have brazenly torn off their usual "labor-capital cooperation" mask and are taking advantage of the situation to attack us workers. This kind of attack has been seen repeatedly in various places. Now, even the capitalists of the Shishi Xinbao, who have always claimed to be responsible for "guiding society" and "representing public opinion," have begun to act. During the "January 28th" Incident, what the people of Shanghai suffered, besides the sacrifice of lives and property, was a very widespread and profound unemployment. Those in the war zone were indeed displaced and suffered from hunger and cold. The people in the non-war zone, especially us poor workers, also suffered a lot. The depth of the pain is beyond description, and there is no need to describe it, as everyone can see it clearly. At this time, those unscrupulous capitalists, while chanting unity against foreign aggression and touting increased production as a slogan, took the opportunity to hire unemployed workers at particularly low wages, dismissed the original workers, and intensified their exploitation, such an evil scheme of taking advantage of the situation was also adopted by the newspaper capitalists who claimed to be "civilized". As a result, more than a thousand of us newspaper workers have since been poisoned by them. When the Shishi Xinbao dealt with its staff last year, the newspaper authorities, on the one hand, recruited new staff from outside, and on the other hand, dismissed all internal staff. Although the Journalists Association and the Colleagues Association repeatedly negotiated, it was to no avail. Finally, they received very little severance pay and were all dismissed. Now, the fierce Shishi Xinbao authorities are using the most cruel tricks to inflict disaster on us workers. The Shishi Xinbao capitalists' actions were determined at the beginning of the "January 28th" Incident. Therefore, during the incident, they demanded that all the newspaper's workers work overtime to produce extra editions with very little compensation (all one hundred and more people were only given 13 and a half yuan per day). The newspaper's workers, under the repeated threats of "suspension of publication and dismissal," had to endure the pain and accept it. Then, the management began to take direct destructive and oppressive measures. On the 2nd of this month, without the consent of this union, they unilaterally ordered the newspaper's workers to print the Da Wan Bao. The newspaper's workers refused on the grounds that they had not received orders from the union and had not been authorized to accept it, and this union also refused because the Da Wan Bao was not under the jurisdiction of this union. The management took the opportunity to coerce all the newspaper's workers, proposing: (1) All workers must publish a statement in the newspaper withdrawing from the Newspaper Workers' Union; (2) Cancel labor-capital conditions; (3) Workers must not interfere with the management's administration in the future (meaning that from now on, the management can do whatever it wants with the workers and they cannot object); (4) Dismiss standing committee member Zhang Baokang and other conditions, forcing the workers to accept. At the same time, Jiang Jiemin, a running dog of the capitalists, locked down the factory, falsely accused Zhang Baokang of being a Communist, accused all the workers of striking, reported them to the police for arrest, and expelled all the newspaper's workers from the factory. The daily newspaper was then printed by the Da Wan Bao's Daluz, it can be seen that the management's order for the newspaper's workers to print the Da Wan Bao was entirely a deliberate provocation. The Da Wan Bao has its own printing factory and absolutely does not need the Shishi Xinbao's workers to print it. From then on, the Shishi Xinbao refused to allow the newspaper's workers to work, and on the other hand, hired other workers to start practicing. Once they are proficient, their conspiracy will be a great success. However, compatriots, please try to imagine for us, we had just escaped from the ruthless artillery fire of the Japanese army not long ago, and were working for the newspaper. Some of our families were completely destroyed, and some barely escaped with their lives. Life was already very difficult, and adding such a blow, how will we maintain our lives? Won't our families starve to death? The Shishi Xinbao capitalists shout "patriotism" and "anti-Japanese" all day long. In practice, they are using the old tricks of traitors taking advantage of the national crisis, are these capitalists worthy of being Chinese? Can China unite to resist Japan and be liberated from the oppression of imperialism with such capitalists who kill each other? A traitor who throws a bomb and kills three or five compatriots should be shot. Then, a capitalist who uses a conspiracy to cause hundreds of people to freeze and starve alive, his crime is no less than that of a traitor. How should he be punished? Can the Shishi Xinbao capitalists, who are more ferocious than traitors, still be tolerated in China, tolerated by humanity? Now, for our own interests, we can only unite to oppose this kind of capitalist who kills without shedding blood. We vow to protect our organization and fight to the end. We hope that compatriots across the country will give us sympathetic assistance. Our conditions are: (1) The Shishi Xinbao authorities must publish a solemn apology to the Newspaper Workers' Union in the newspaper; (2) Restore the original state before April 2nd. The Shanghai Newspaper Guild hereby declares.</p>
<h3>Kidnapper Zhu Songlin Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Zhu made remarks before execution, saying it is better to die early and comfortably than to be a slave of a fallen country, and told his family not to collect his body. Kidnapper Zhu Songlin, also known as Xu Miaogen, and his concubine Zhou Juxian rented a廂房 in Gu Zhaoshi's house in Taipingfang, An'nan Road. They discussed that Gu Zhaoshi's daughter Yao Guoshi was a recent widow and left behind an eight-year-old son, Jusheng, and had a huge fortune. Zhu then devised a plan to kidnap Jusheng and demanded a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Because he repeatedly broke his promises, he drowned Jusheng in the Pu River. Zhu was arrested by the Public Concession Police and sent to the First Special District Court, and was sentenced to death. The provincial government approved the execution by firing squad. Yesterday morning, a judge from the Special Court brought Zhu Songlin to the case, verified his identity, and ordered him to be escorted to the Second Prison in Caohejing for execution. At the same time, the Local Court was notified to appoint Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming as the supervising officer. He then ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Officer Chen Xihui to supervise the bailiffs Wang Jianqing, Gu Hanqing, Yin Daoxu, and Zhang Chunsen to go to the execution ground. After the judge and Warden Dong Changmin took their seats in the public office, Zhu Songlin was brought to the case for questioning. He was 36 years old, from Pudong, living in Yangjing, Pudong, and had parents, a wife, and children, but after his death, his family did not need to collect his body, lest his children be gossiped about in the future as descendants of someone executed. In addition, he had more than 1,000 yuan in the past, lent to Lu Shuntong, and after deducting what he had received, Lu still owed him 763 yuan. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, Zhou Genrui, the deputy captain of the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau, helped him and escorted Lu for delivery. Later, he was released on bail by someone, and he requested to chase him down. He was originally in the rice business and had opened a coal business. Because he was confused for a while, he was arrested for the first crime and was executed by firing squad. But in this era, it is better to die early than to be a slave of a fallen country, so death is comfortable and happy, without any doubt. Please execute it quickly, etc. The judge then ordered the execution, and Police Chief Xu and others ordered the bailiffs to take him down for execution by firing squad. The body was collected and sealed by the court.</p>

Suddenly, the national crisis caused stagnation in the administration. Now, the elites of the country gather in one hall, and it is appropriate to pool their efforts to first determine the national policy and establish a common belief. Sincerity can be achieved, so that the Provisional Constitution can be implemented immediately and the Constitution can be drafted quickly, complete autonomy, and share the four powers. The implementation of the Constitution is expected, and the success of the revolution is certain. As for the responsibility of implementation, there is a department in charge, and there is no need for verbose words. I believe that the way to save the country is only through this.

<h3>Sir Lytton's Statement</h3>
<p>Cannot recognize governments not recognized by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Longhe ship arrived in Beijing today and had lunch early. It docked at Jiangxin, Pukou at 12:30 PM. Because the Jinpu Railway Bureau's preparations were not thorough, the luggage handling procedures were very slow. It was not until 3:00 PM that they landed. Lytton told reporters on the Chengping ferry that the League of Nations assigned this team the task of not knowing that there are other countries to contact with the exception of China and Japan, covering the fact that the League does not recognize the Manchurian puppet state. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, thousands of people gathered at the Jianggan in Pukou to welcome the League of Nations Investigative Team, unaware that the team members had quiet and important things to do during their short stay in Nanjing. When the team members arrived in Beijing from Hankou on the Longhe ship, they took a small boat to Deng'an in Xiaguan, changed to a car, and went directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign Minister Luo showed them the original of the 1905 treaty and the record of events. There was no text in the treaty or the record of events that China agreed not to build a railway parallel to the South Manchurian Railway. According to the team members, when they arrived in Tokyo before, the Japanese government showed them the original of the treaty and the record of events, claiming to be the 1905 treaty, saying that China agreed in the record of events not to build any parallel lines, and that China's contract text had been lost. After the team members left Beijing for Hankou, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs searched old cases and found the original contract. When the team members left Hankou, Dr. Gu Weijun sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making arrangements for the necessity of showing the contract to the team members. The purpose of the team members landing in Beijing this time was extremely secret, only claiming to visit government leaders. A Reuters reporter boarded the Longhe ship to visit Sir Lytton, and Lytton briefly expressed his views on the refusal of Dr. Gu to enter Manchuria by the new government of Manchuria, saying that the investigative team was commissioned by the League of Nations to investigate the situation in Manchuria, and had the full authority to decide who can accompany and who cannot, and would not allow others to intervene. The reporter also asked if the investigative team received an invitation from the new government of Manchuria to carry out formal activities, wouldn't it be acknowledging the government? Lee answered that the investigation team only recognizes the Chinese government and the Japanese government as being recognized by the League of Nations and the world. The investigation team cannot recognize any government that has not been recognized by the League of Nations or other governments. Sir Lytton also said that he and the members of the team enjoyed touring Hankou and that Shanghai has local problems, while Nanjing represents the political life of the whole country. The team members were pleased to see Hankou gradually recovering from the unprecedented flood. They visited refugee camps in Hankou and saw hundreds of thousands of refugees working to build dikes near the city. Lytton concluded by saying that the team members had inspected Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou, and would now visit the highest authorities in the three eastern provinces (meaning Zhang Xueliang, etc.). The team members decided to enter Manchuria by rail instead of taking a boat via Dalian. A spokesman for the investigative team told a Reuters reporter that the Longhe ship encountered extremely bad weather last night. At 9:30 last night, due to rain and fog, it touched the sandbank east of Anqing. It was anchored for an hour before it could continue to advance. The Longhe ship arrived in Beijing at noon and berthed in the middle of the river. Sir Lytton and other members landed at 2:05 PM with Dr. Gu and went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to view the original of the 1905 treaty. They then took a boat across the river and landed at Pukou at 4:00 PM. Ten minutes later, they boarded a specially prepared train and departed north. A team of specially selected military police accompanied them to protect them. General McCoy, General Krout, and Dr. Henick rode in the same car. Sir Lytton and Earl Macartney rode in the same car. When the train started, military music played loudly. Foreign Minister Luo personally saw them off. Dr. Gu, Zhang Xueliang's consultant Dounar, and Japanese attendant Yoshida also traveled in the same car. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>London Four-Power Conference</h3>
<p>Assisting the Economies of the Danube States</p>
<p>Complete Agreement in Principle</p>
<p>Participating Representatives Form a Committee</p>
<p>To Examine the League of Nations Financial Report</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - The Four-Power Conference was held in the British Foreign Office today. It has been agreed in principle that the distressed countries of the Danube must be assisted. All participants cautiously avoided actions that could bind the conference to implement a specific plan. Today's meeting decided that a committee composed of representatives from the four countries will study the report of the League of Nations Finance Committee on the finances of the Danube countries. Today's meeting made a very promising exploration of the entire issue. All representatives hope that this meeting will produce good results. It is estimated that the Four-Power Conference will conclude on Friday. It is heard that there were differences of opinion between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy during today's meeting. The difference in their views lies in whether Bulgaria should join the Danube countries' alliance, and whether the Danube countries should discuss federal affairs independently. Britain and France advocate that the proposals of the Four-Power Conference be submitted to the governments of the Danube countries, allowing them to hold meetings and discuss among themselves. Germany and Italy do not agree, advocating that all nine related countries, namely the four major powers and the five smaller Danube countries, hold a plenary meeting. Their reason is that if the Danube countries hold meetings independently, it is inevitable that Austria and Hungary will be oppressed. This difficulty still needs to be resolved. The relief measures mentioned at today's meeting include two items: one is financial assistance from Britain and France to the Danube countries, and the other is concessions from Germany and Italy on tax rates. Germany and Italy are the main markets for the distressed countries of the Danube. The committee of the Four-Power Conference, composed of the chief representatives of the four countries and chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald, was then established. At the end of the meeting, the following communiqué was issued: Today, the representatives of the four countries exchanged views on the various difficulties contained in the current economic and financial situation of the Danube countries, and on the nature of the most appropriate measures to resolve these difficulties. Before the meeting adjourned, a committee was formed to submit a report on this matter to the resumed meeting on Thursday afternoon. All four participating countries agreed to send one expert each to form a committee of experts to examine the difficulties raised in the report of the League of Nations Finance Committee investigating the financial situation of Central and Southeastern European countries. According to the report of the League of Nations Committee referred to in the communiqué, which was published not long ago, the League of Nations has scheduled a special meeting to be held in Geneva next week to consider the events related to the Four-Power Conference. The committee of experts must begin work as soon as all the expert commissioners have gathered in London. The British expert commissioner will be Mr. Rose of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 6th - According to reliable sources, the German delegation seems to have declared to the German press that, judging from the current meeting situation, the German and Italian views seem to be based on commerce, while the British and French views focus on finance.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th - The reaction in Europe caused by the Four-Power Conference is that Germany and Austria are deeply concerned that France and Britain are secretly negotiating agreements behind the scenes. France has hinted that the negotiations will inevitably lead to a break. Germany is now concerned about the presidential election, but is very concerned about the progress of the conference, suspecting that Britain may be prepared to exclude Germany, Italy, and Poland from the Danube Alliance in exchange for French concessions on reparations. The leader of the Austrian National Socialist Party in Vienna has telegraphed British Prime Minister MacDonald, protesting the inclusion of Austria in the Danube Alliance while excluding Germany.</p>
<h3>Stimson's Trip to Europe Related to Far Eastern Affairs</h3>
<p>National, Washington, 6th - According to reliable sources, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson will consult with various European countries on Far Eastern events during his trip to Europe. Although the obvious purpose of Stimson's trip to Europe is to promote the disarmament conference in Geneva, the Far Eastern event will actually occupy a large part of Stimson's mission in Europe, and the Sino-Japanese war will be the main focus of the Far Eastern event. Stimson's goal is to present his policies to the authorities of various countries and obtain their support so that the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact can maintain their dignity. Stimson is scheduled to depart from New York on Friday for the East and will attend the disarmament conference in Geneva, and then will personally go to London.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister to Visit Russia</h3>
<p>Contains Significant Political Implications</p>
<p>National, Ankara, 6th - Turkish Prime Minister Ismet Pasha will visit Soviet Russia when Foreign Minister Rushdi arrives in Moscow. Although this move is a formal courtesy visit, which was decided months ago, its great significance is valued by people here, given the recent developments in the international situation.</p>
<h3>Economic Sanctions Should Be Imposed on Those Who Disrupt World Peace</h3>
<p>The Proposal of U.S. Senator Keppel</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th - Senator Keppel proposed a bill in the Senate today to implement commercial boycotts against those who violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 6th - U.S. Senator Keppel, a well-known figure in the publishing industry, proposed a resolution in the Senate today to expand the scope of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to prevent the United States from recognizing any treaty concluded in violation of the pact. According to Keppel's proposal, which is consistent with Secretary of State Stimson's previously announced attitude toward Japan, his motive is related to Japan's activities in China and the establishment of the Manchurian puppet state, and the widespread rumors that the Shanghai negotiations will result in the conclusion of a treaty.</p>
<h3>Japan's Party Rule Bankrupt</h3>
<p>The Origin of the Rise of Fascism</p>
<p>President of South Manchuria Railway, Following Eguchi, Submits Resignation</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - The spoils system (that is, all official positions belong to the winning party) has caused Japan's party rule to lose its credibility. At present, the tendency of Fascism has arisen because of this. Now, the administration of the Japanese in Manchuria has also encountered difficulties because of this. Since Eguchi, the vice president of the South Manchuria Railway, resigned because he belonged to the Minseito party, Dalian news now reports that President Uchida and Director Omori have also telegraphed the government to resign, expressing their protest.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th - Mr. Yada was appointed today as the vice president of the South Manchuria Railway, replacing Eguchi.</p>
<h3>Japan's Ministry of Colonial Affairs' Plan to Immigrate to the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Planning to Move 500,000 People Within Ten Years Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 7th - The Ministry of Colonial Affairs has established an immigration plan to move 100,000 families, 500,000 people, to Manchuria within ten years. It is scheduled to be implemented in Showa 7 (1932). In the first immigration, 640 families, about 3,000 people, will be sent to Manchuria. The required expenses of 3.5 million yuan will be proposed to the council for approval.</p>
<h3>The Deceased Match King Failed in Speculation During His Lifetime</h3>
<p>Putting the Country in Economic Panic</p>
<p>Losing International Credit Completely</p>
<p>National, Stockholm, 7th - The late Match King, Kreuger, has been respected by society for many years. Now it has suddenly been discovered that he had been falsifying accounts during his lifetime. If the suspension of cashing was still being implemented, this discovery would have caused national panic. However, Sweden, which has long been known for its wealth, will inevitably fall into economic difficulties because of this, like other European countries, and the future is uncertain. It is not known where it will end up. Because the Swedish people have always admired Kreuger, many have invested all their wealth in the businesses operated by Kreuger. The whole country has suffered this blow, and it will not be able to recover in a short time. It is heard that the Swedish government, in addition to allocating funds for assistance, is also responsible for compensating the losses caused by Kreuger's fraud, so as to prevent Kreuger's business from completely collapsing, destroying the livelihoods of tens of thousands of households, undermining the national economic system, and damaging Sweden's international credit.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th - The accounting report of the Kreuger Company has caused panic in German banking circles. A well-known banker said that important industrialists like Kreuger are actually cheating in this way. No wonder the world is in such a precarious position today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - After the news of the unclear accounts of the Kreuger Company was published, Swedish Match shares fluctuated greatly in the London and New York stock markets today.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Second Day of the Investigation Team in Hankou</h3>
<p>Various Circles Presented Opinions in Great Detail</p>
<p>The Investigation Team Had an Excellent Impression</p>
<p>They Still Took the "Longhe" Eastward That Evening</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Hankou on the 5th and declined all banquets. According to the scheduled procedure, they met with representatives from all walks of life, inspected the disaster area's embankments, and visited Wuhan University. That evening at 9:00 PM, they still took the "Longhe" steamer eastward. Detailed records are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting with Representatives from All Circles: From 9:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, the investigation team met with representatives of various public organizations in Wuhan at the Deming Hotel and held talks. The main points of the talks were recorded by Secretary Haas.</p>
<p>Talks with Representatives from the Business Community: Lord Lytton spoke on behalf of the investigation team, and He Hengfu spoke on behalf of the business community. Lytton stated that regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the political aspects have been discussed with your government. You represent the business community, and we intend to discuss the economic aspects with you. (1) Do Chinese merchants and people use boycotting the purchase of goods as a strategy to resist foreign aggression? (2) Does your country use refusing to buy goods as a way to resist aggression not only against Japan but also against other countries? Has the same method been used, and is there such a thing? (3) Dissatisfaction of the Chinese government and people with the treatment of foreigners, such as unequal treaties, leads to the use of propaganda methods, posting anti-foreign slogans everywhere, and fostering a sense of resistance to foreigners among the people. Can such actions be lifted once the Sino-Japanese dispute is resolved? (4) If the Sino-Japanese dispute is resolved, but the overall external problems of China, such as the issue of unequal treaties, remain unresolved, and anti-foreign propaganda continues as before, wouldn't incidents similar to the Sino-Japanese dispute be likely to occur from time to time? (5) Did the Manchurian Incident directly affect the commerce of your port? He Hengfu answered each question one by one: (1) The Chinese people deeply love peace. After being stimulated by Japan's military aggression, they only use not buying Japanese goods as a passive resistance and also to promote the awakening of the Japanese side. Japanese people slander us as being anti-foreign, which we absolutely cannot admit. (2) The method of boycotting goods is only used temporarily against violent aggression and will absolutely not occur against friendly countries. (3) The Chinese people hope to have fair and equal treatment in the international community, which is completely separate from the Sino-Japanese dispute. (4) Unless unequal treaties are abolished, there will naturally be a hope for equality. However, before various treaties are amended through reasonable procedures, they will absolutely be observed. (5) The Hankou commercial losses from the Manchurian Incident were enormous. Items such as grain, bean oil, salt, and coal could not be transported, and disaster victims could not buy wheat from Manchuria, all of which proves the impact.</p>
<p>Talks with Representatives of Journalists: At 9:50 AM, journalists were met. First, Li Shuxian of the press community gave a welcoming speech, saying, "Regarding Wuhan, we can offer facts for reference to draw your attention to: (1) Japan's conspiracy to disrupt Wuhan. Japanese merchants in Hankou, whether in the concessions or Chinese territory, have never encountered unfortunate incidents under the protection of the Chinese government. However, using the excuse of protecting its nationals, after the Shanghai Incident occurred, the Japanese government made military installations beyond the boundaries around the concessions, setting up machine guns and artillery on rooftops within the concessions as if facing a major enemy, and also dispatching up to ten warships. It was only recently, upon hearing of your team's arrival in Hankou, that they began to separately withdraw and redeploy. All of this, in addition to the photos that our representative entrusted Dr. Gu (Weijun) to send to your country yesterday (the 4th), can be consulted with the foreigners living in Hankou. This is sufficient ironclad evidence of the Japanese premeditated attempt to disrupt Wuhan. As for the issue of Wuhan's security, you will visit Wuhan University, which is nearly twenty li away from the city, this afternoon, and you will not find it difficult to understand the Chinese government's ability to maintain security. There is absolutely no need to worry excessively. (2) A brief history of Wuhan's boycott of Japanese goods. There have been a total of three boycotts of Japanese goods in Wuhan: one during the period when Japan forced us to sign the Twenty-One Demands in the fourth year of the Republic (1915), one during the Jinan Incident in the seventeenth year of the Republic (1928), and one during the September 18th Incident last year (1931). These boycotts were all natural responses of the people angered by Japanese aggression. The people's boycott movement is not organized in any way, and the people themselves all carry it out individually. The Jinan Incident of the seventeenth year of the Republic occurred on May 3rd, while the boycott organizations were established at the end of May. The Mukden Incident last year occurred on September 18th, while the boycott organizations were established in mid-October. This shows that the trouble was started by them, and the blame does not lie with us. Moreover, each boycott movement has always been stopped when the atmosphere between the two countries is slightly eased, and the Chinese government has repeatedly advised the people to exercise restraint beyond reason and weighing the pros and cons. For example, the Wuhan Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stopped its activities this year at the request of the Japanese consul, which is the result of this kind of advice. Furthermore, there is something that should be solemnly declared to you: the Chinese people's boycott of Japanese goods is by no means a boycott of Japanese people. The boycott of Japanese goods is even less of an exclusion of foreigners. The sharp reduction in unemployment among workers' unions in England is due to the acceptance of large orders from Chinese merchants, which is sufficient</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>to prove that while Chinese people resist Japanese goods on the one hand, they still buy goods from other countries to meet their needs. (3) The fact that Japanese people have restricted Wuhan's public opinion. A few years ago, the Hankou Sino-Western Japanese Newspaper was asked by the Japanese consul to order its suspension because it reprinted the Japanese Tanaka Cabinet's memorial to the Emperor, exposing its traditional aggressive conspiracy. Fortunately, it was rejected with strong words, and it did not become a reality. However, the Japanese people's restrictions on our country's public opinion can be seen from this." Then Li Jun raised questions and asked Sir Lytton to answer, roughly stating that the people of Manchuria have lost their freedom of speech and publication under the threat of Japanese violence. All the leaders of the puppet organizations have Japanese advisors monitoring them when they talk to foreigners. When your team arrives in Manchuria, what methods will you use to obtain the true intentions of the people and a portion of the threatened puppet leaders? Sir Lytton calmly said, "We have been planning this carefully and know how to take care of ourselves."</p>
<p>Talks with Representatives from the Academic Community: At 10:20 AM, representatives from the academic community in Wuhan came to meet them. Representative Chen spoke, stating everything and submitting a written opinion, first expressing welcome and the educational aim of our country, the ultimate goal of which is universal harmony. Japan says that China has anti-Japanese education, but the textbooks approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education absolutely do not contain this fact. Japanese geography, history, and maps all contain facts of aggression against us. There are more than 300 kinds of works that advocate aggression against our country. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has supported the League of Nations and trusted the League of Nations. Japanese newspapers, however, denigrate the League of Nations and have newspapers as evidence. Japan interferes with our country's internal freedom of speech in newspapers and insults our Chairman Chiang and our government, all of which have newspapers as evidence. Japan says that our country is anti-foreign. As for Britain's use of the Boxer Indemnity to develop the textile industry, newspapers say that British industrialists have ambitions in the Yangtze River and use large loans as bait. Japan says that it did not help the puppet state of Manchuria, but its newspapers strongly advocated it beforehand, all of which have evidence for your review. In addition, when our country withdrew its troops from Jinzhou, Japanese newspapers actually said it was a plan of Britain and Germany, which shows that Japan will do anything to provoke the relationship between China and the League of Nations. Japan believes that force is omnipotent and wants to monopolize economic development. The cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict lies in its political monopoly, and the impact on the business affairs of various countries in China also lies in this. Tanaka's memorial can be checked, and many Japanese newspapers and magazines are presented in person, including Japanese insults to the League of Nations (the picture is of a prostitute hugging Briand), documents insulting Chinese government leaders, and documents insulting Chinese students. In addition, there are Japanese people deliberately spreading rumors that Britain once lent China 10 million gold pounds, totaling seven items. Then Sir Lytton, McCloy, Murdoch, and Secretary-General Haas asked the academic representatives about the anti-Japanese movement in China in the past. Chen and others replied that since Japan strengthened itself and built the Andong Railway, the Chinese people have had a bad impression of Japan because it has invaded Chinese territory and sovereignty. Now the boycott of goods is the result of Japan's aggression against China.</p>
<p>Talks with Representatives from the Labor Community: At 10:30, representatives from the labor community in Hankou, Wang Jinxia, Li Kaichen, and translator Zhang Yaobin, visited the League of Nations Investigation Team for talks. Sir Lytton and various commissioners met them. Li immediately asked Wang and others for their opinions on the Sino-Japanese negotiations. Wang Jinxia immediately stated in detail the various facts since Japan forced our country to recognize the Twenty-One Demands. Sir Lytton said that we are very clear about the political facts, but we hope that Representative Wang will tell us the opinions of Chinese workers on the Sino-Japanese negotiations. Representative Wang then earnestly stated the opinions of Chinese workers on the Sino-Japanese negotiations. The main points are: (1) In fact, the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai Incident were originally the entire strategy of Japan's aggression against our country. We hope that the League of Nations will pay attention and not regard the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai Incident as two separate issues. (2) We hope that the League of Nations will, in accordance with the mission of the League of Nations, uphold international justice, maintain world peace, immediately sanction Japan, and limit the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria and Shanghai to the shortest possible period, restore the original state before September 18th, and compensate our country for all losses. Otherwise, it should, in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of the International Covenant, sanction violent Japan. (3) If violent Japan disregards justice and despises the League of Nations and threatens our country with force, wanting our country to succumb to violent Japan, our country's workers can have their heads broken and blood shed. Even if there is only one last Chinese person left, they will still seek survival from death and fight the Japanese to the death, never succumbing to Japan. (4) We are breaking off economic relations with Japan because the Japanese have repeatedly oppressed our country. Our country's workers are very heartbroken and have no choice but to vow to never buy Japanese goods and not work with Japanese people to promote their awakening. It is absolutely not anti-foreign. Japan is reversing the cause and effect and saying that we are anti-foreign, attempting to deceive the League of Nations to fulfill its ambition to monopolize China. Moreover, all European and American countries are friendly to us, and our country's people have never had the same facts occurring with European and American countries. This can prove that our Chinese workers not buying Japanese goods and not working with Japanese people are really not anti-foreign.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Disaster Area's Embankments: At 11:00 AM, the investigation team went to Zhanggong Embankment and Daijiashan to inspect the embankment works. Special Commissioner Chen Guangzu of the Wuhan Office of the disaster area working group, Director Li Jin, and Gu Weijun, etc., departed from the Deming Hotel in more than 20 cars. When passing through the Japanese concession, the Japanese side had removed the sandbags and electric fences. At 11:30 AM, they arrived at Daijiashan, climbed the embankment, and looked far away. Li Jin, etc., pointed out the disaster area map to Sir Lytton and other members, recalling the tragic state of the flood and the progress plan of the aftermath work. Although the wind was very strong and dust blew in their faces, Lytton and others still paid close attention and asked questions tirelessly. Many members used quick cameras to photograph the remaining sheds and the situation of disaster workers transporting soil to repair the embankment. At 12:00 PM, they returned to the Deming Hotel. In order to facilitate the investigation team's inspection of the embankment, the disaster area working group specially printed a brief English report on the embankment restoration project and distributed it to the members. At 3:30 PM, Lytton, McCloy, and Crowe left the Deming Hotel and went to Wuchang. German representative Hina was slightly unwell, and Italian representative Macchi also couldn't go because of important business. After crossing the river, Li and others took cars to visit the Old, Weak, Women, and Children's Shelter on Fuyuan Street. The shelter was sponsored by the Water Disaster Relief Association and housed more than 4,000 people, living in more than 20 sheds. An orphanage was set up, with classes taught in six shifts. Women learned crafts. Lytton and others inspected in turn and visited the classrooms. At 5:00 PM, they left the shelter and went to visit National Wuhan University.</p>
<p>Visiting Wuhan University: Lytton and his party arrived at Wuhan University at 5:15 PM. After getting off the car, they were entertained with tea and refreshments by Chairman of the Reception Committee Shao Yizhou, Dean of Academic Affairs Wang Xinggong, Professors Zhou Gengsheng, Yuan Changying, Zhou Tianyang, and Fang Zhong, etc. Because of the short time, there were no speeches. Later, Ms. Gao Junshan, on behalf of the entire body, submitted a written opinion to Lytton, roughly divided into four points: (1) The Japanese troops who illegally occupied Manchuria and Shanghai. (2) Important outstanding Sino-Japanese cases must be fully resolved, either internationally or with international participation. (3) In order to strictly fulfill Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, the League of Nations Investigation Team or any representative of the League of Nations must not take any action to recognize the so-called Manchuria. (4) If the League of Nations' resolutions cannot be satisfactorily implemented, then Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should be immediately implemented. Lytton replied that after the investigation, he would definitely convey this opinion to the League of Nations. Then Zhou Gengsheng, a representative of the faculty, talked with Li and raised three questions: (1) Your team will go north to Manchuria for on-the-spot investigation, but that area is currently occupied by the Japanese army. I am afraid that they will cover up their behavior and obstruct your team's actions in that area, preventing your team from investigating as much as possible. Li replied that we have our own methods to prevent them from obstructing. Zhou asked again what kind of expression your team will make to the puppet state created by Japan after your team arrives in Manchuria? Will you recognize it as a country and have talks with it? Li replied that we have no expression to make to the Manchurian puppet state and will not have talks with it. Zhou asked again that after your team investigates, if the League of Nations handles the Sino-Japanese incident based on the report, and Japan still does not accept it, will the League of Nations impose sanctions in accordance with the covenant? Li replied that we can't talk about that at this time. It was already after 6:00 PM, and all the members said goodbye, boarded the car, and drove around the Wuhan University campus for a week, still returning to Hanyangmen and taking the original ship back to Hankou.</p>
<p>Leaving Hankou by Ship to Nanjing: The entire investigation team boarded the Longhe steamer between 7:00 and 8:00 PM, ready to depart. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, He Baohua, Zeng Yiding, Chen Guangzu, Ma Dengying, and Zhou Zechun, etc., boarded the ship to see them off. Representatives from all walks of life, students, and a company of the 48th Division's honor guard, a platoon of the navy, and the military bands of the 48th Division and the 13th Division were all lined up to the left and right of the Yihe Wharf. Armed police and security teams were responsible for security. At 9:30 PM, the Longhe steamer set sail eastward. He Chengjun and the farewell representatives were all on the lighter, tipping their hats to pay their respects to the members of the investigation team. The team then left Hankou eastward amidst the sound of military music.</p>
<p>Impression of the Investigation Team: When Sir Lytton was about to leave, he gave a talk to reporters about his impression of this trip, including municipal administration, embankment works, construction, and disaster victims' education and vocational training, and said that this trip was worthwhile. The talk roughly stated that we are honored to have received a warm welcome from the people of your area on this trip. Since arriving in Hankou yesterday (i.e., the 4th), we were busy with banquets that day and were unable to visit various places in person. However, the streets we passed through, although after the great flood, were still neat and beautiful, and the military police maintained orderly order, which was very different from the news we had received before arriving in Hankou. This morning, we also went to Zhanggong Embankment to inspect the embankment repair project. We felt that the method of embankment repair used by your country was something we had never seen before. The construction was very precise and careful, inch by inch by hand. Although it is different from the method of embankment construction used in our country, which uses scientific methods or mechanical work, its effectiveness may not be worse. Moreover, your country, after encountering an unprecedented disaster, followed by a serious international negotiation, can still work hard on embankment construction, which we admire. We very much hope that your area will not have another flood this year and that all embankment works will be completed before the water rises. The orphanage we visited in Wuchang this afternoon was very complete, with education and care combined. Although we felt the tragedy of the disaster in your area, we felt a little relieved to see the enthusiastic relief efforts of your government and local people. As for Wuhan University, it is truly the most complete university, and its construction is particularly beautiful and solid. In short, this time we came to Hankou and observed in places such as Shanghai and Nanjing, and we feel that your country has already actively started material construction, and everything, everything, has given us factual proof. Then General McCloy and General Crowe also spoke one after another, expressing that the impression gained on this trip was excellent.</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Seven Small Inland Lake Steamers Robbed: Suzhou News. Since the Shanghai war, lake bandits have sprung up like hornets, and cases of robbing steamers have been heard from time to time. On the 2nd of this month, a merchant steamer traveling from Shengze to Suzhou was robbed by bandits near Bei㘮, and no passengers were spared.

<h3>Gold Price Reaches 700 Taels</h3>
<p>Slight Fluctuations, Slightly Trending Upward: Yesterday, the gold standard rose again slightly, but the waves did not stop, fluctuating by several taels. There were a total of thirteen taels of review throughout the day, entering and exiting at 700 taels. The psychology of the industry was uncertain, and buying and selling were very different. The market trended higher in the morning, probably because the silver market reported a contraction. However, the drafts were tight and then loosened again, especially because the situation was still difficult to be optimistic about. The sellers were brave and suddenly shed more than ten taels. The market recovered to a good situation. The shorts covered their positions, and foreign exchange seemed stable. The Indian exchange reported a small increase, and it broke through the 700 tael mark again. A detailed record of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Front Market Once Fell: The opening price for May immediately rose by four and a half taels, calculated at 702 taels. Da Tiao and the Bank of America each fell by a quarter, and private telegrams also fell by a quarter. Subsequently, Da Decheng, Yuhe, Yuanmao, Yongyifeng, Yong Bingxing, Tong Taichang, etc., competed to enter the market. The first order was also firm. British and Japanese banks mutually traded June 180625. Hua Bank sold the current period of eight pence to Hua Bi, so the market price jumped by four taels to 05 taels and eight qian, which was offered by Yuanheng Fuyu Lai, retreated to 04 taels and two qian, 05 taels and seven qian at 9:30 AM. HSBC listed a reduction of 25 in British gold, and the US dollar was reduced by 125 only because the exchange rate was large. Dalian Gang and Tong Taichang, etc., came to buy, and a certain bank bought cash. At around 9:40, it was 07 taels and seven qian. Afterwards, it seemed to soften slightly. Citibank sold US$31.75 to 875, and the June British gold was settled at 179375. On the table, Fuchang, Hengyu, Shenkang, Bingxing, Hongkang, Yong, etc., all sold. From 9:45 to 10:30, it depreciated by more than seven taels, only calculated at 700 taels. Yingfeng, Hengtong, Fentong, Hengyuan, Kangxiang, etc., came to enter, and a certain bank continued to enter cash, a total of 420 bars. However, the market price did not improve, which was actually due to the situation. At 10:45, it increased slightly by more than two taels, to 702 taels and four qian. Afterwards, the drafts had withered, and Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Hengfuyu, etc., in the market had a strong selling intention. The central government appeared with US$31.8125 and British gold 18125, so the gold price fell by six or seven taels. At 11:30, it was 95 taels. Qian Changxiang entered slightly, to 96 taels and eight qian. At noon, it closed at 94 taels and eight qian, which was actually because the supply exceeded the demand, so it was difficult to stand firm. The listed price was changed to 768 taels, calculated at 60 taels to 72 taels and three qian.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Had Short Positions Covering: The opening price in the afternoon was 96 taels. Xiexing Yong slightly went out, retreating to 95 taels and a half. Afterwards, Fuyu Hengyu Wupin Hongkang Yong came to buy, and it rose to 99 taels. At that time, there was a difference of one tael and a fraction. Because Hua Bi absorbed US$32.3125 in July, the market was stable. After 2:30 PM, Yuan Kangxiang, Hongkang Yong, Da Decheng, Yifeng Yong all sold, and there was a rumor that the US dollar seemed to be loosening, and US$32.375 was not easy to sell, and it shed four taels. At nearly 3:00, it was 95 taels. Soon, it was learned that the Indian exchange reported a small increase of thirteen annas, and Hongkang Yong Da Decheng bought, and the price rushed up by as much as six taels. At 3:40, it was 701 taels. At that time, it went down by two and a half taels. In an instant, it saw the peak again. Qian Changxiang, etc., dragged in. At 3:50, it was 701 taels and three qian. After 4:00, retail investors sold, to 98 taels and six qian. Fortunately, the general short positions came to resist and advance to level out the losses, not to be carried over to the night, so the market closed at 4:30 at 700 taels and three qian, a rebound of two taels and eight qian compared to the previous day. The largest amount for the entire day was 07 taels and seven qian, and the smallest was 94 taels and eight qian, a difference of 12 taels and nine qian. The listed price was calculated at 70 taels inside and outside. The recorded amount was 89 taels to 95 taels in the morning and 94 taels to 700 taels in the afternoon. The supplementary water was 89 taels in the morning and 94 taels in the afternoon. The bare bars were calculated to increase by three taels and two qian.</p>
<p>Buying and Selling Were Extremely Inconsistent: According to the statistics of transactions on the selling counter, Da Decheng, Tong Taichang, Yuan Kangxiang, Fu Taiheng, Yuhe, and Yifeng Yong all entered. Yuantai, Qian Changxiang, and Hongkang Yong were very busy in and out. Zhifeng Yong, Shunli, Xiexing Yong, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Da Kang all went out. Hengyu, Fuyu, and Hongkang Yong all made up their positions in the afternoon. Yuan Mao Yong, Da Decheng, Fu Taiheng, and Yuantai were in and out from time to time. Xiexing Yong, Richang, and Yuan Kangxiang all went out.</p>

<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates continued to decline.

The Indian rupee fell by 1.75 yuan, French francs by three yuan, German marks by half a yuan, and Japanese yen by half a shield. The Straits dollar increased by 1.75 yuan, likely due to slight internal changes.</p>
<p>The market was tight in the morning, loosened later, and leveled off in the afternoon, mainly because the gold market was quite volatile, fluctuating by eleven to twelve taels throughout the day. It eventually rose slightly, resulting in a decrease of 0.01875 compared to the previous afternoon for British gold, while the US dollar increased by 0.0125, both due to a sharp rise of more than three points in British-US exchange rates.</p>
<p>Trading among banks was very active, with approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold traded. The American banks slightly sold gold, with varying accounting practices. There was also a volume of 800,000 to 900,000 yuan in US dollars. The market was bullish in the morning and sold off before advancing again in the afternoon. The American banks sold before advancing.

<p>Yesterday, interest rates remained chaotic. The rates between the morning and afternoon markets were 7 mace and 0.08625 li. The silver discount in the morning and afternoon markets was the same at 0.015, with no hope of change. The bank's listed rate for "hua tou jia shui" was 0.04, and the bank's listed rate was 0.06.

Copper coins increased by 500 wen to 407,500 wen.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Current Yarn Merchants' Willingness Fades</p>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn appears dull again. Rumors about the current situation are intensifying, dampening people's spirits. Gold prices are trending down, causing the market to loosen. The willingness of various merchants has also turned lukewarm, lacking any proactive power. In summary, the environment is deteriorating, and there is no hope of excitement in the market. However, there are slight signs of activity from Guangdong merchants, while the amount of input from Sichuan merchants is very small. The reason cited is that business in Sichuan is sluggish, resulting in weaker purchasing power. It is estimated that various merchants bought a total of 300 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 0.0025 to 0.0055 yuan. Among the merchants, Ningbo took in 10 bales, the domestic market took in 30 bales, the northern market took in 15 bales, Guangdong took in 50 bales, Shantou took in 60 bales, Jiangxi took in 35 bales, and fellow merchants took in 65 bales. Shenxin Factory slightly released some odd lots, all in the spot market, it was said.</p>
<h3>Current Cotton Mills Need to Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton market is relatively sluggish, mainly due to the falling prices in the US cotton market and the severe downward trend. The market conditions are unstable, and the six-cent level for US cotton is unlikely to be maintained. Due to this, the local sentiment is weak, and mills are unwilling to import large quantities of raw materials. Furthermore, yarn sales are weak, making it even more difficult to invigorate the market. However, sporadic transactions continue. Shenxin Factory is slightly short of raw cotton and has a slight interest in importing. Other factories are moving more slowly, and various sources are still declining. The selling prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton 34.00 Hongzhang took in 100 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Bulls Finish and Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices were mixed initially due to a lack of confidence. Later, due to the slump in Wall Street and the liquidation of long positions, prices declined. Futures fell by 10 to 14 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. Both British cotton futures and spot prices fell by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 6th).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Sparse and Brisk</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the weather was overcast, and there were few rice boats arriving. The shop's stomach was quite brisk. There was a limited amount of high-quality Wuxi Japonica rice. The prices of intermediate grades were slightly higher. There was some buying interest in early and late rice. The Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants were the most numerous, and prices also rose by one or two "chi." Foreign Du Jian rice sales were initially sluggish but later became active, and the situation stabilized. Yinhua rice noodle demand was sluggish, and the market was weak by 0.1 yuan. Bianyuan rice was scarce and without a market.</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the source of goods from the west road was eight or nine, and the sales market in this city was more prosperous than the previous market. Changshu and Xixi North Japonica rice were purchased by the merchants for 2,000 stones, and the price rose one or two jiao compared to yesterday. Thin rice and early rice glutinous rice shops bought 500 stones, and the price was as originally planned. The Bian Yinyuan market was neither prosperous nor declining. The river factories opened around 5,000 stones of various goods per hu.</p>
<h3>The Local Market Has a Strong Appetite for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was stagnant for merchants. Although the merchants in Hankou had a good appetite, the goods they had in storage had not yet been completely loaded. Other merchants were also mostly watching. However, the local market and the countryside had a strong appetite. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of small jiao Saigon rice, 300 bags of Min Dang rice, totaling more than 3,000 bags were transacted. Prices were able to stand relatively well. The quoted price for small jiao Zhongguan rice was 9.6 to 9.5 yuan, for Saigon No. 1 rice was 10.7 yuan, and for Min Dang rice was 9.8 yuan. Because of a large report in the production areas on the future new trade, the foreign company shouted high, and the set prices for many have not yet arrived, so there was no continued transaction. The return cargo has six or seven hundred tons in April and May, and the price is similar to the previous market. In addition, the settlement price for March was 300 tons, and the price was 4.525 taels, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Futures and Spot Flour Moves Upward</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Were Flat...Hoarding and Buying Were Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for spot flour was initially flat and then rose, and the situation changed from weak to brisk. Transactions were active, and prices continued to rise by about half a fen. Actual sales of spot flour were not high, and hoarding and buying favored the May futures, so spot flour transactions were less than 10,000 bags, while futures transactions were as many as 60,000 to 70,000 bags. The factory side was in high spirits and still shouted high market prices, unwilling to sell easily, intending to raise market prices and then take the opportunity to sell continuously. A small number of June futures were also sold. In the morning, the prices of spot and futures flour were both flat. In the afternoon, because the factory side and brokers raised prices mutually, the result was 2.08 taels for spot flour, 2.085 taels for May, and 2.095 taels for June, all about 0.005 yuan higher than the previous market, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Dried Lily Flowers Has Turned Downward</h3>
<p>The sales of dried lily flowers are mainly in Guangdong and Fujian, so when the Shanghai war was at its height, only the Guangdong merchants had an appetite, and the market price for upper and middle grades stabilized. Recently, the war has stopped, the markets in Fujian and Guangdong have declined, and the weather is gradually getting hotter, and there is a risk of deterioration for the less expensive goods. Therefore, the selling price has tended to fall, with the upper and lower grades ranging from 21 taels to 12 to 13 taels. It is difficult to be optimistic for the time being, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Trading of Piece Goods, Woolen Cloth, and Western Clothing Merchants is Not Weak</h3>
<p>The market situation for woolen cloth has improved slightly recently. The Western clothing tailoring merchants in this street have a great need, but most of the business is in whole pieces and ten-yard codes, and most of the transactions are spot. Medium-thick serge, bouclé tweed, haute couture, flannel, etc., have all been traded.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Foreign Nails, Slightly Brisk for Small Sizes but Stagnant for Large Sizes</h3>
<p>The transaction of foreign nails has recently been sluggish and depressed due to the delay of export merchants, and the market situation has been depressed. The market trend has been declining. However, the foreign exchange rate has been trending downward in recent days, and the source of arrival has been scarce. Therefore, the standard has been able to maintain without falling by 100. The current price for each barrel of Tonghua colors is 8.25 taels. The single-string price requires an increase of 0.001 to 0.002 yuan. However, the small colors have been selling better recently, so the market appears firm. For example, 3-point sizes sell for 12.25 taels, 4 and 5-point sizes sell for 12 taels, and 6-point sizes sell for 11.75 taels. There are fewer inquiries for large colors, and the market is more stagnant, it was said.</p>

<h3>Preface to the Catalogue of Xiqu Books in the Brown Wood Lodge Collection</h3>
<p>— Song Chunfang</p>
<p>Since I first traveled west as a young man, attending lectures in famous cities and seeking books in neighboring countries, my passion has always been for xiqu. The secret texts in official libraries and the precious editions in private collections, I have browsed through nearly ten thousand volumes. In the fourth year of the Republic [1915], I first traveled to Paris and immersed myself in the Bibliothèque Nationale, forgetting to return for three months. In the sixth year, I returned to China, bringing back with me what I loved. In the tenth year, I crossed the sea again, passing through Germany and Austria. At that time, the great war had just ended and currency values had fallen, so I emptied my purse and packed my belongings to the east. Later, I was plagued by illness and shelved them high. In the past five or six years, I have traveled between Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin, unable to settle down. Last year, I spent four thousand yuan to build the Brown Wood Lodge on the coast of Qingdao, gathering my books there. This spring, I resigned from the Qingdao Municipal Council, closed my door, and wrote this catalogue, completing it in a month. Over the past twenty years, I have searched diligently, but I have acquired no more than two thousand volumes. My financial resources are insufficient, and my knowledge is limited, so there is nothing to be surprised about! Fortunately, my collection is limited to one category, so the scope is narrow and selection is easier. Even this small collection is rare. Compared to xiqu collections in France, it is only one-hundredth. As for collecting all four categories, gathering up what has been lost, filling the shelves with books, that is a matter for the public, not something a private individual can do. Moreover, accumulating bit by bit, gathering and dispersing are impermanent. Not to mention the distant past, but recently, like the Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng and the Cehai Pavilion in Yangzhou, the elite of generations have ultimately scattered and disappeared. What I have now will be difficult to preserve forever, especially with the flames of war approaching? Having finished compiling, I am filled with worry, and I record my feelings as follows. Written by Song Chunfang of Wuxing on February 7th, the twenty-first year of the Republic [1932].</p>
<h3>Record of a Blood Case in Rugao</h3>
<p>— Lu Pin</p>
<p>The case of the Rugao wicked wife killing her concubine has caused a sensation in Shanghai. Newspapers have even spared precious space recording the anti-Japanese bloody war to publish it. It is attracting attention along with the Feng Deqian case in Hong Kong and the Liu Mengying case in Hangzhou. Recently, the belly has been cut open to extract the infant, and the officialdom is trying hard to exonerate. Now I will briefly record the events before and after this case and what I have heard in society to inform readers.</p>
<p>This case is not about jealousy and love. It is by no means a blood case resulting from a love triangle. It is nothing more than a convoluted plot to murder for money. The cause of the case is largely due to social relations. Xu Chengyu's taking a concubine was really due to the "patriarchal concept" that having no descendants is a serious matter. Xu's wife and Xu's nephew's killing of the concubine was due to the "inheritance of property issue." That such a major case was staged in the rural society of Rugao is nothing more than the work of money. Only Xu has more than 100 mu of fields. Although it is said to be well-off in the countryside, it is estimated that it is really not worth ten thousand gold. Why is there so much pain to take this and seize that.</p>
<p>The outbreak of this case was due to the neighbor's unjust report. This point is not very common in ordinary criminal cases. However, the reason for the neighbor's injustice also has a cause. Rugao has a special type of person who lives by litigation. After the change of dynasty, this wind has not been reduced slightly. They also spread rumors and take pride in handling bribes. After this incident occurred, the father of the corpse initially reported it but stopped it soon. Someone of the litigation scoundrel had already handled the settlement. He told Xu that he had settled it with the yamen for a thousand yuan (that is, the meaning of bribery). The roads said that the rumors were fading. The strong item in the village then came forward to report it and affirmed with confirmation. Then the case was revealed.</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, it is enough to prove that the backgrounds of the recent three blood cases are different. The Liu case in Hangzhou is a kind of dispute in the intellectual world. The Feng case in Hong Kong is a tragedy for the propertied class. As for the Xu case in Rugao, it is just a disaster caused by rural society. How can they be viewed as one?</p>
<h3>The Shanghai War and Military Equipment (2)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Rifles</p>
<p>Today, the most important firepower weapon used by infantry and cavalry is rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, etc. As far as rifles are concerned. The invention of the rifle was in the thirteenth century. Our Mongolian army created this while conquering Europe. However, the rifles at that time used gunpowder and iron beads. The equipment was extremely slow. They could only shoot within fifty steps. It is said that Timur conquered the Japanese pirates. This weapon was used to win. (According to Japanese history, the Mongolian army used iron guns to win in the so-called Battle of Bun'ei.) Later, Belgium also invented rifles made of iron, which were improved versions of the Mongolian army's guns. At that time, they were called matchlock guns. Fir-Lock However, the guns originally used in Japan were imported from our country. Because their history shows that during the time of the Ashikaga shogun Yoshimitsu, Chinese people crossed the sea and presented two iron guns. In 1640, France invented the flintlock firing mechanism and the bayonet. Bayonet Then the matchlock gun became ineffective. Since then, it has gradually changed from a single-shot gun to a magazine-rifle. Magazine-Rifle This time, the rifles used by Japan in the Shanghai War. Judging from the weapons confiscated by the 19th Route Army. It is a Type 38 automatic rifle and carbine. and the Type 41 carbine. The telescopic sights installed on these rifles. Fore-Sight When firing. Very precise. The bullets used. There are several types of tracer bullets and armor-piercing bullets. There is also the British-made Rythason automatic rifle. Especially ingenious. The bore diameter of this automatic rifle. Muzzle about seven hao. Fires bursts. In one minute. Can shoot 25 to 50 rounds. Can reach a distance of more than 1,000 meters.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Marital Residence in Double Buildings (28)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Hall for Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Marriage Agreement Forces Someone to Wander About, Disturbed and Confused, The Enemy's Atmosphere Plunders the Land, Hostility Begins to Reopen</p>
<p>Amidst that extreme joy and excitement. It was as if a brilliant flower was blooming right before my eyes. In the blink of an eye, that flower bloomed bigger and bigger. From the middle of the pistil, a happy world was transformed again. A happy family. Was prepared for them. Welcoming them hand in hand as they took big strides towards that place. To be a rare couple in the world. Then everything in front of them. As well as everything in the future in their dreams. All were really perfect. Extremely transcendent. So happy that they were about to ascend to immortality. As if drunk. After discussing those trivial matters. I also feel spiritually superior. In high spirits. Especially to use some of the instincts of women to comfort men and manage household affairs. Very readily helped An Yutian to tidy up that messy and untidy room once. The thread-bound books and Western-style books that were thrown all over the world on the desk. All put in one pile after another according to their category. I opened a few more drawers. A large bunch of old letters and scraps of paper. grabbed and stuffed under the desk in the wastebasket. I also took a chicken feather duster. Everywhere I patted the dust accumulated on all the appliances. When she was like a swallow playing in the mud. Flying around and flitting around the house. Working busily and endlessly.</p>
<p>At the same time. From time to time, he would point at An Yutian with a smile and say, "Look at you. How糊 (muddle-headed). A single room. Too lazy to clean it myself. I can't stand this dirty mess. For the time being, I'll just pick it up casually tonight. It would be best to call a waiter to come another day. I'll supervise the thorough washing and cleaning. After all, if it's cleaner. People always feel more comfortable living in it. An Yutian said yes on one side. Thank you on one side. I also followed his heels and went around in circles. I also helped a little along the way. Taking advantage of the fact that she didn't pay much attention at the time. I quietly brought over that golden box that attracted trouble. Secretly stuffed it under a letter paper box in a desk drawer. Fortunately, she didn't care anymore and there were no more problems after that. After tidying up. I guess she was a little tired too. Stood in the middle of the room as if she had lost her mind. Shook her lower head like a circle. Flapping the short hair that was scattered on the front of her forehead to both sides. He put his jade hands on his slender waist again. Then he rolled his autumn waves like a bone. I observed the whole room carefully again. Suddenly I discovered that his bed was too unclean. Still can't be considered satisfactory. Then he said. Let me tidy up your bed too. There are clean pillowcases and sheets. Take it out and I'll change it for you. Such intimate care. That is directly to try out the duties of her wife's cabinet system in front of you. And it seems to show her wise heart and wonderful arms. The way to take care of a husband is very good. Let him appreciate this benefit. When I increasingly feel that getting married and being married really has a great need. To promote the realization of the marriage.</p>

<p>"Free Talk"</p>
<h3>On Naming</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The Grand Historian said, "The way of Heaven is vast, how great it is! A talk that is subtle and to the point can also resolve disputes." These few sentences are originally from the Grand Historian's "Biographies of Jesters," and I am quoting these four sentences today, taking them out of context, simply to borrow the two words "free talk" to embellish this newspaper's local supplement.</p>
<p>The text in this supplement mostly contains a humorous intent, and cannot be taken as a serious history, nor can it be taken as text such as the "current affairs commentary" and "forums" of major newspapers. I, your humble servant, have once stated this in the local supplement. Today I want to change the name of the first type of topic in the local supplement, because the previous topic "Small Forum" is not good. It is too solemn. Later, I changed it to "Casual Talk," but it was also not good, as it was too meaningless.</p>
<p>Now I have thought of these four old-fashioned words, simply to borrow the meaning of "a talk that is subtle and to the point can also resolve disputes." However, although this name has been chosen, various difficult problems have thus followed.</p>
<p>The first difficult problem is whether a free talk can be subtle and to the point. If it is not to the point, what then?</p>
<p>The second difficult problem is whether it can resolve disputes. If it cannot resolve disputes, what then?</p>
<p>Regarding the above two difficult problems, I thought for a long time and could not solve them, and I had to find another name for it, but thinking it over and over, I could not find a more appropriate topic. There was no way, and in the end, in the square inch spirit platform [mind], I passed this name from the form of a majority of approvals, and after the decision, it was actually announced in this publication today.</p>
<p>But how can the above two difficult problems be solved? In fact, it is not very difficult to solve the above two difficult problems, because the first difficult problem is mine, and the second difficult problem is people's. As for mine, no matter how difficult the problem, according to our observation and based on our brains, we can use an ancient saying, "A foolish man's consideration must have a gain." Moreover, he said that the subtle character in the free talk is subtle, and there are two meanings. One is as long as it is subtle, it does not have to be completely accurate, and the other is as long as it is subtly accurate, it does not have to be noticeably accurate. One meaning is from the point of view of number, and one meaning is from the point of view of quality. The interpretation is very broad, or it may be effective.</p>
<p>If the second difficult problem is not with me, then naturally we have no power to force others to obey and execute. We can only see their "humble offerings" and whether they are willing to adopt them or not, the power of which is in the hands of all. We can only do our best. As for people, I have nothing else to say, only the two words "hope" to tell.</p>

<h3>Feeling Sad Looking at the Northeast and Composing This</h3>
<p>— Xu Gushen</p>
<p>The local supplement's art and literature column published a masterpiece by Meng Zhao. Therefore, I imitated his intention and drafted thirty-six rhymes. In the white mountains and black waters, beacon fires rise on the flat ground, the light of swords fills the borders, the killing atmosphere rises in the willow frontier, the northeast fence has been removed, sweeping our mountains and rivers, the map will change color, and the golden urn is almost incomplete. The Rongma has ravaged, and the huts have been swept away. The atrocities have not yet ceased, and the people have been subjected to blood and dirt. There is no peaceful day, and the disaster is tied to the war. Where different flags are flying, they claim to be the ruler and arbitrarily count the years. Isolated from the Central Plains, the three provinces have a different sky. They decorate the scene of peace and compete in the false capital. What is ashamed is that they are not independent, and they rely on the Yi people to move. Under the breath of others, they draw a plan for surviving in the snail corner. Strange goods are really habitable, advancing and retreating frequently pulling each other. What is this act for? The precedent is a mirror of Korea. The Han people have forgotten their origins, and the Japanese like to form a relationship. Cultivating kindness must be repaid, and they wish to wield the whip to open up the frontier. The Korean scholar holds the golden bird weapon, and the Ying imperial concubine manages the green hairpin. They offer the treasure seat in a dignified manner, and secretly compare to needles in felt. Drums are beating everywhere outside the suburbs, and there is still music in the palace. The nest is overturned without knowing the danger, and the feelings are the same as the merchant girls' pity. Alas, those followers bow their heads and present the watch. One person is promoted, and chickens and dogs ascend to heaven. They turn their guns and kill their compatriots, and cook beans to attack each other. At the time of turning clouds and overturning rain, the pockets are full of gold coins. The shame of Nenjiang has not been washed away, and they sit side by side with the enemy. The bandits have little ambition and eagerly hope to connect with official positions. The generous gift is not respectful, and the acceptance is drastically reversed. Abandoning the righteous army alone, they ran directly to the camp of the prisoners. It is even more regrettable for the scholars who pursue the sages in their studies. Why not cherish themselves and consign their reputation to the flowing spring? The old man in his seventies has no face to return to his hometown. From afar, thousands of miles away, he will choose a place to sleep with cows. How can he obey the fall of the ancestral country, but only seek the integrity of his family. Judging by the Spring and Autumn Annals, the righteousness of loyalty and evil is judged in simple chapters. The people of the country grieve for their humiliation, and the enemy state laughs at their madness. Their hearts are seduced by profit, so what can be blamed?</p>
<h3>Events of March 2nd</h3>
<p>— Xishen</p>
<p>Overnight, the Ninth Division was withdrawn, and there were no more Han banners in sight, The souls of the insect sand soldiers were hard to rest, and the tiger and leopard gate could not support the gate. Who made the pottery from breaking the Great Wall? He wanted to return to Wenshang, but what else could he say? You all have the strategy of pacifying the Rong, but you can only shed tears to the east,</p>
<p>The calamity of Xianyang is all over the land, Who can stop the raging tide to the east of the hundred rivers? One army bets on Weng Tan Cai alone, A hundred roads surround the sea and land. I only heard of Wei Jiang's strategy of building a house, But it is difficult to continue the merits of Yue's family in shaking the mountain, I don't know what is going on day and night, The crown covers are gathering at the second high school,</p>
<p>Mass Science</p>
<h3>Bromine</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>In 1826 of the Western calendar, Mr. Balard discovered bromine. Because it has a pungent and foul odor, its English name comes from the Greek word for stench. It is one of the eighty-five elements, with the chemical symbol Br2. At normal temperature, it appears as a dark brown liquid. Among the elements, only it and mercury are liquid; the other elements are all gases or solids.</p>
<p>When bromine is cooled to -7 degrees Celsius (7 degrees below zero), it solidifies into dark, needle-like crystals. When heated above 60 degrees Celsius, it boils and turns into reddish-brown vapor. However, it also volatilizes very easily at normal temperatures. If you smell it, the odor is unbearable.</p>
<p>Bromine vapor is very heavy. If you drop a few drops onto the bottom of a slightly heated flask, it will vaporize and turn into reddish-brown smoke, which stays at the bottom. If you don't move it, it's really hard for it to rise to the top. It dissolves in water more easily than chlorine, and mixes very evenly. The solution is called bromine water. The most concentrated bromine water contains up to 3% bromine.</p>
<p>The laboratory preparation method for bromine is the same as that for chlorine gas. Now I will write the chemical equation below: 2Na Br + 2H2SO4 + MnO2 ↓ Sodium bromide Sulfuric acid Manganese dioxide Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2H2O + Br2 Sodium sulfate Manganese sulfate Water Bromine If you only want to make a small amount of bromine, you can use the most common potassium bromide to replace sodium bromide.</p>
<p>In industrial manufacturing, the fact that the combining power of bromine is weaker than chlorine gas is utilized. Chlorine gas is passed into an aqueous solution of magnesium bromide, driving out the bromine, and the chlorine gas combines with magnesium to form magnesium chloride.</p>
<p>Sodium bromide and magnesium bromide are mixed in seawater, and are found in greater quantities in the salt layers of the Stassfurt Dead Sea in Germany; therefore, the raw material for bromine is natural. Recently, the United States has been manufacturing bromine. About one million pounds are produced each year.</p>
<p>Bromine has a wide range of uses. Bromine water can be used to manufacture hydrogen bromide by utilizing the property of combining with hydrogen, or as a reagent. It can corrode and irritate thin mucous membranes, so small amounts of bromine are used medicinally. It can be applied or inhaled to treat diphtheria. The bromine component in bromides can calm the nerves, so bromine is used to make such medicines, with potassium bromide being the most common. Bromine is used to make dyes; and can be used to make a very peaceful disinfectant. Silver bromide emulsion is used to coat photographic plates and films.</p>
<p>Just chatting</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>— Ding Nu</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, you must have been greatly shocked by this disaster."</p>
<p>I looked at him with a desolate gaze. He was silent for a long time, then raised his sorrowful face and replied painfully, "Ah, wasn't I...?" Just as he was about to continue, he was interrupted by the deafening sound of cannons. It turned out that the heroic 19th Route Army had not retreated on the day we met, and was still calmly resisting the artillery fire coming from the Japanese side. Mr. Liu was a little surprised how he could hear such clear cannon fire at this location, but I was used to it.</p>
<p>After a pause, he continued, "I'm really lucky to have saved my old life. On the night the incident occurred, we were all still in our residence. When we woke up in the middle of the night and heard the rumbling of gunfire, we prepared to escape, but we had no opportunity. We waited until dawn, and when the gunfire subsided slightly, we staggered out the door. But after walking only a few steps, a shell hit the wall next to us. A large chunk of the gray wall immediately collapsed. I was so scared that I stepped back a few steps, and the gray wall fell less than ten feet away from me. You see how dangerous it was."</p>
<p>He spoke with lingering fear, and a restless, faint light shone from his eyes. We both sighed in unison. He continued, "After escaping, I stayed at the home of a Mr. Lin. All the bedding and clothing were temporarily borrowed from him. I never dreamed it would come to such a messy state."</p>
<p>Two days ago, he came to my residence again, looking haggard and thin, still the same as before. After sitting down for a while, he searched in his pocket and pulled out a bunch of burnt iron tools. He earnestly said to me, "Everything I had is gone. This is the key to the front door of my house. A neighbor picked it up for me yesterday. More than twenty years of hard work, only this little memento remains. It's so heartbreaking."</p>
<p>Mr. Liu is a person who has devoted his life to the study of Southeast Asia. He had collected no less than several hundred kinds of books and treasures related to Southeast Asia, but now they have all been burned to ashes. It's truly a pity. I said, "The enemy's intentions are truly vicious. In this incident, whether it was private or public cultural institutions, they were all destroyed. It's not a big deal that we lost tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of properties. The most important thing is that our cultural institutions were destroyed. In our culturally backward China, this blow cannot be underestimated." He nodded and said in a drawn-out voice, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then we talked a lot more, and he finally said goodbye and left. As he walked down the stairs, I looked at his back, which seemed the same as what was commonly seen on Baoshan Road.</p>

<h3>Animal Labor</h3>
<p>— Lu Ling</p>
<p>Among animals, those that can use their intelligence to assist humans in their work, such as cattle, horses, and dogs, have been doing so for so long that it is no longer strange. In recent centuries, human affairs have become complex and there is not enough time for everything. Although there are machines that can assist, machines are machines, rigid and without spirituality. Certain tasks still require human labor. Human labor is limited, so we have to seek assistance from animals. Thus, the so-called animal labor has emerged. Using animals to assist people in their work requires a meticulous training process. In various European and American countries, there are those who practice animal training, mostly derived from the old methods used in circuses. In recent years, there has been visible progress, to the point where it seems that there are virtually no animals that cannot be trained to be useful. For example, elephants, known for their clumsiness, have recently had two trained to be useful in the Belgian Congo. They can carry heavy loads and travel long distances, and be directed by people, and during wartime, they can also be responsible for transporting ammunition and food, going in and out of the jungle, and doing their part for the country. Other animals, such as baboons in South Africa, have recently been taught to work on farms. It is said that their performance is very good, and their work efficiency is twice that of the natives. Also, monkeys in Sumatra are often raised by the natives to harvest coconuts. Their efficiency is like that of humans, and their diligence is also like that of humans. However, they are cunning in nature. They have fixed working hours every day. Whenever they see people working in the same place stop working and rest, they will also stop working at the same time, unwilling to do even a minute or a second more of work. This is also interesting.</p>
