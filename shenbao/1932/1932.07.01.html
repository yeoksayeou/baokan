<h3 id="c1">青年如何利用暑假 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>今人論報紙之責任者。輙曰是應批評政治。監督政治。訴說民衆之疾苦。作民衆之喉舌。實則斯猶爲消極之作用也。吾人則認爲與其使報紙爲民衆之喉舌。母寗使其爲民衆之學校。與其使報紙消極批評政治監督政治。母寗使其爲民衆之活的敎材。導以入於進步與創造之路。夫一紙刋出。流播全國。直接之讀者。間接之聽者。爲數何慮數十萬。此一博大無垠之學校。若其作用僅爲消極之訴苦與批評。而不能敎育民衆誘導民衆。開闢新天地。創造新世界。母乃辜負此一博大無垠之學校。</p>
<p>尤有進者。青年爲國家之元氣。爲國家將來之中堅。視今日之青年。即可預斷他日國家之治亂。「十年樹木。百年樹人。」爲「樹人」計。爲培植國家將來之人材計。報紙對於青年。尤應注意敎育。應利用報紙爲活的敎材。與青年發生親密之關係。</p>
<p>目前暑假已届。全國學校。都將放假但時丁國難。内則水災未復。外則强敵壓境。關外之河山變色。滬變之創痛猶新。國至今日。已臨到生死線上。我人民亦惟有臥薪嘗胆刻苦以培養奮鬬之實力耳。顧復有何假期之可言。假期内兩月光陰。如坐令虚擲。至爲可惜。以故多數敎育家輙向本報建議。主張本報以徵文之方式。鼓勵青年利用暑假作有計劃之工作。更以養成青年有計劃之習慣。而又可藉以使報紙與青年發生密切之關係。本報接受此種有意義有價値之建議。爰特舉行暑期徵文。</p>
<p>此次徵文之題目爲「民國二十一年暑期工作計劃及工作報告。」命題之意。蓋亦着重於暑假期間作有計劃之工作。吾人認爲計劃爲一切事實之母。亦即爲成功之鎖讑。一國之政治然。個人之事業亦無不然。國家政治而無計劃。則將紛如亂絲。個人事業而無計劃。亦將永永無由進步。此次徵文。專爲全國大中小男女學生。吾人認爲大學生應有大的工作計劃。即小學生亦應有小的工作計劃。利用暑假致力於社會事業者。應有其計劃。致力於本人學業者亦應有其計劃。無計劃生活。即無活力而無意義。茫無歸宿。此點則爲我人敢希望青年諸君所特予注意者也。</p>
<p>雖然。有計劃尤貴能實踐。閉户造擬。紙上談兵。何計劃不可成。但計劃而長擱置於紙上。不能實踐。則計劃亦復何用。故本報不僅深盼學生諸君能於暑假開始時擬一精密之計劃。尤盼能於暑假終了時。將有實現此計劃之實際工作。貢獻於社會。徵文題之所以劃分計劃與報告兩項者。用意即在於斯。</p>
<p>本報認爲此次徵文。非同於科舉式之考試。亦不同於錦標式之競賽。實有極重大之敎育意義。深盼全國之敎育家及賢明之父兄。共起提倡。并予以有力之贊助。</p>
<p>至於徵文之一切詳細辦法。均載今日本報敎育新聞欄内。幸檢閱之。</p>

<p>路透三十日洛桑電　賠欵會議辦事委員會午夜集議後、已於原則上商得同意、故目下此間復有樂觀之傾嚮、現希望此項同意能溝通法德兩國之異見、德國並未拒絶减數而全付之理想、但堅主此當視爲一種貢獻於歐洲善後經費之欵、今晨辦事委員會會商德國所應供給歐洲經濟恢復經費總數時、又發生新波折、德國允供給二十億馬克、法國則索七十億、德代表圑現正在討論此點、現悉英國已附和法國要求關於美國戰債之保障條文、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十九日洛桑電　今日傍晚、洛桑會議形勢、尙屬混沌、但巴本總理之堅持不讓、使德國債權國間之連帶關係、愈臻强固、英相以洛桑會議主席資格、向發起會議諸國之代表發問、謂假使規定」筆總數、令德國支清、以後即不再付任何欵項、在如此條件之下、各國代表是否準備放棄賠償、簽答曰然、惟德國財長默不一言、可見各債權國已統一陣綫對付德國矣、其所以如此者、或因各國對於彼等均爲美國之債務國一層、尙未忘却歟、</p>

<p>路透二十九日芝加哥電　民主黨大會今日在此開會、於歡呼聲中通過廢除酒禁之議案、以此爲總統選舉運動中之重要政綱、查共和與民主兩大政黨現皆主張廢止酒禁、蓋共和黨大會前已以六八一票對五七二票、通過取銷酒禁而易以中央管理之議案也、</p>

<p>自大學區制取消以後、中大經費根本動搖、全校師生惴惴不安者已非一日、及去年秋季因蘇省中小學校長之請求、蘇省黨政聯席會議决停撥中大經費後、該校學生、卽一再向政府請願、確定校費基金、遷延迄今、依然毫無結果、滬戰以後、各種經費無着、該校敎授大半另覓出路、以維生計、及四月間開學敎職員所得薪水僅三成、處於首都生活程度高漲之下、確有難以爲繼之苦、此敎授會所以一再開會討論索薪辦法、並發生敎授總請假一日之事、學生則亦因滬戰後、籌欵不易、請求學校允予先行註册上課、欠繳各費、由敎授擔保、分次繳還、及見敎授之欠薪累累、校欵日絀、當然發生同情、因此敎授與學生合組經費獨立運動委員會、請求政府將英庚欵之利息作爲中大基金、政府方面以英庚欵由換文規定用途難以變更、學生所求未逹、憤恨已餘、不免感情用事、故中大風潮之發生動機實爲經費、苟經費方面有所保障、則校長問題當可迎忍而解、决不至有毆拒段氏之兼代也、</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>四十三　　全村的人都轟動了，朱先生呌我出去看看是什麽事。「「</p>
<p>「土匪要來打刧了，你去看看。」小二哥在路上對我說。我在人羣中擠過去，只見土地廟的牆上貼了一張奇怪的紙條條，上面寫的是：</p>
<p>『國民軍十三師長趙飛令張鬍子即日送五千元到木穉湖湖犒軍。我們是五個月没有發餉了。你若忍心坐看我們餓死死，那就是一個没有仁道的守財奴。限你三天内送錢來，以手電燈爲記。過限没有錢，莫怪我翻臉無情，切切此諭。</p>
<p>這條子你猜是用什麽貼的？誰也不易猜着。是用泥貼的，有，有趣吧？張鬍子從烟霞洞裏驚醒了。我看他第一次在太陽陽光下慌慌忙忙的跑來問訊。他有什麽法子呢？家私差不多多吃光了。奔走了三天連五百元也凑不足，只好把全家搬到到城裏去躱避。從此不再下鄉。第四天早上土地廟前又貼了了一張字條，比上次還要厲害。</p>
<p>『國民軍十三師師長趙飛再令張鬍子。你不服從本師長長命令，可惡已極。再限你三天報效一萬元、若再失信把你全家親友殺得鷄犬不留，切切此令。』</p>
<p>這幾天以來村友個個驚心吊膽。有槍的是二十多家，但但是各人自保，毫無組織，不毫等候土匪來繳械罷了。保安隊是請了十幾次也没有一個肯來。我們古廟裏的幾個人却却是高枕而臥。土匪來請他喝兩杯清水。要吃糙米飯，也可可敬他一大鍋。破布爛棉花如果愛上了，也可以奉送。我和和小弟弟還以被綁爲慮。朱先生說：『綁去正好試辦土匪敎敎育。』這些是我們茶餘飯後的打算。</p>
<p>第五天，離古廟五里路地方的一個五歲的孩子被土匪撕了票的消息傳來。這孩子的父親是一個自已耕種的老農。土匪綁去之後索價八百元。這老農典田賣屋凑上四百元去　　。土匪把白銀子收下，指着一個小土堆說，『你要你的孩子嗎？在那土堆裏。』</p>
<p>朱先生一怒而進城去。他去做什麽？可惜來不及問老許又放謠言說：『朱先生怕土匪綁他，所以跑了。』</p>

<p>由閘北搬往兵工廠</p>
<p>砲彈爆發死三傷二</p>
<p>日軍撤退時、所遺留於閘北吳淞江灣等處手溜彈砲彈炸彈頗多、自經吾方接收後、即行佈告、並設法將炸彈檢出、集中於公安局閘北辦事處、繼再由兵工廠派員前往檢騐、裝運該廠軍械庫保存、昨日、閘北辦事處方面、在未經兵工廠檢騐以前、即僱用搬塲汽車、裝運大批檢獲之手溜彈砲彈炸彈等、運往該處、當至該廠搬運入庫時、小工不愼、堕地爆炸、致炸斃二人、炸傷三人、其詳情如下、</p>
<p>砲彈爆炸　昨日下午一時餘、公安局閘北辦事處、僱用中國搬塲大卡車一輛、附乘搬運小工四人、由該處内裝運手溜彈炸彈砲彈等甚多、至二時餘、始行裝竣、即由該處派副官洪樹仁押運、經中山路而入南市、於三時抵兵工廠西砲臺軍械庫之第十三號庫房前停落、並通知該廠軍械庫長張祖聯、同時遂由搬運小工、會同該庫老庫兵干萬有·高德富·陳正祥·等、由卡車上搬運至第十三號庫房内存放、甫搬十餘個時、搬運小工顧山·突將所搬之鋼砲砲彈、約二十餘磅者一枚、至庫門内時、失手擲於地上、該砲彈上之碰火、並未拆去、一觸以後、當即爆炸、</p>
<p>傷亡一斑　該小工及押運押官洪樹仁、當塲炸斃、血肉模糊、慘不忍睹、並將同在搬運之軍械庫兵干萬有·高尙德·陳正祥·炸傷、高之兩腿、已炸去、陳之頭部及一腿、亦爲炸毁、傷勢極重、惟干傷勢較輕、時正三時十五分、</p>
<p>送院救治　當該彈爆炸、濃烟頗多、兵工廠一時不明眞相、疑係失愼、當即電知各救火會、各區救火會聞訊後、當即派出救火車馳赴西砲臺、以並未延燒、遂當塲將受傷之庫兵干萬有·高尙德·陳正祥·用該會救護車、送往海格路紅十字會醫院醫治、</p>
<p>傷亡略歷　昨日當塲炸斃者、爲公安局閘北辦事處副官洪樹仁、年二十五歲、廣東人、前充警圑副官、及警察大隊部特務員、當閘北辦事處成立時、由黃主任調派處内服務、顧山、江北通州人、年二十餘、在中國搬塲公司爲搬運小工、重傷者陳正祥·高尙德·尙傷干萬有·三人均爲江北人、在兵工廠充當庫兵、已十餘年、對於搬運軍火、極能當心、從未失事、昨日被炸時、其背部距離被炸處接近、致均受重傷、</p>
<p>派員調查　肇事後、該廠當即電話通知閘北辦事處及市政府、辦事處接電後、即派服務員黃河·周得信·二人、馳赴兵工廠、調查肇事眞相、黃周二人抵廠後、除晤及軍械庫長張祖聯外、並晋謁宋廠長、對於此事、有所請示、至五時許始返、</p>
<p>善後問題　炸斃之洪樹仁·顧山·之屍體、現仍停放西砲臺十三號庫房對面、上覆以蘆蓆、將於今日由辦事處收殮、受傷之干高陳三人、以高陳二人傷勢極重、生命危險、恐無生望、昨日該廠庶務科先行發給各人車資十元、如果傷重斃命、當撥因公損命之前例、從優撫恤、關於撫恤費用、將向市政府交涉、高亦於昨晚因傷重殞命、</p>

<p>黃石嘴暗礁肇禍</p>
<p>幸船員均慶無恙</p>
<p>邇日商輪失事、接踵不絶、而揚子江方面因江流之激漲失事船更多、兹又有英國長江軍艦、在重慶下游觸礁撞毁之事發生、經記者詳細調查、報告如下、</p>
<p>錯行航道　英國海軍、近年因楊子江内匪警頻聞、而上游各處、時有共匪襲攻商船情事、而英商船之行駛長江者尤夥、故特在長江内增加軍艦保衛商輪、砲艦柏德里Cruisepeterel號、專在揚子江上游護航者、此次由重慶下水開來上海、某日行駛至重慶下流一百四十海里地名平安江面時、却値上江漲水、領江者錯認航道、遂致肇成觸礁、又復撞毁艦體之巨禍、蓋川河暗礁叢錯、航行最難、一經水漲淹没、更不易辨覩、稍不經意、便爾觸礁、</p>
<p>觸礁撞擊　柏德里號軍艦錯行航路、向平安江面黃石嘴暗礁上開去、及至艦身之前艙部、衝進礁石、而頭艙底已經觸入礁内、欲開倒車退出、業已不及、頭艙底已經洞破、江水亦冲進、片刻之間、水深八尺、當時該艦下水乘大水急流而行、速率更大、行駛極速、在開到黃石嘴時、其艦身船頭、又向前面大礁石上、猛力撞去、震激過度、頭部經此碰撞、竟毁壞有一丈六七尺之多、前艙部分已全損、</p>
<p>擱淺修救　失事以後、艦長一面發電求救、一面恐江水波及、二三各艙、便將沉於江底、急切間將該艦全身、索性完全開入淺灘之上、使全艦擱淺、則可以不致即沉、而艦長便用水泥木板、將頭艙下的破洞、先行補塡裂處、然後再行抽吸艙中積水、使艦身浮起、届時即令在上游之英砲艦拖曳出淺、帶來上海修理、</p>
<p>損害一班　據聞此次英艦觸礁、並毁去之船頭、全船受損之處、幾占四分之一、艙底雖臨時修塡、而必須重行入塢改造、船頭之撞去者、亦須來滬重建、總計今次該艦觸礁損失、至少六七萬元、而現正在修補曳拖中、不久將開到滬上、入廠大修、艦中員兵、幸未有傷害、但艦身頭部之建築品、亦皆毁壞無餘、</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>一八七二年，有一個廣東長毛出身，呌做容　的，他居然懂英文，他帶着一批學生到美國去留學。這一批學生共有三十人，可算是中國第一批留學生。容閎到了美國以後，討了一美國婦人做老婆。這個美國婦人是再醮婦人，所以還帶着前夫所出的兒子，「拖油瓶」過來。後來容閎竟和那美國婦人閙氣分家，死在美國。容閎在美國聲譽很好，因爲他說英語說得很漂亮，所以美國人竟稱他是演說家。</p>
<p>從容閎聯想到第一批留學生，從第一批留學生聯想到梁正楝唐少川。唐省川，梁正楝就是在這首批留學生三十人之中。唐梁等回來以後，李鴻章就吩咐他們進水師學堂補習國文。首批留學生都是年紀很輕的。那時留學的目的在學習外國的方言，所以要派年紀很輕的學生出去，這樣讀外國書就便當些。</p>
<p>唐少川。梁正棟從水師學堂出來，吾到高麗去，就帶了他們在高麗的海關上做洋文抄寫。</p>

<p>— 才良</p>
<p>予友唐君嘗隨本市義勇軍參戰數月。日前由錫地歸來。曾爲予述此次淞滬抗日戰事之經過甚詳。予以其語皆親歷。爰就各報所未載者補記如下。此次淞滬戰事。爲期僅逾匝月。而日軍之司令官已易其四。其間當以植田來滬時之聲氣爲最盛。統兵約六萬餘。水陸兼備。舉凡最新式之科學武器。又無不應有盡有。益以哀的美敦書之驕慢。大有一戰而定之槪。維時我軍兵寡械劣。而防線又蜿　至四十餘里。腹背受敵。其不至於全軍覆没也幾希。猶憶某次廟行之戰。我軍防守陣地者。只五百人左右。而敵來約三倍之衆。乘勢包圍。情頗岌岌。幸賴某連兵士突生妙計。竟各携機槍潛往攀登距陣地不遠之十餘株榆樹之上。伺敵掃射。當者披靡。然皆莫明其彈之所由來此與閘北某兵士之蜷伏民房屋頂。用步槍射落飛機之神技。大有異曲同工之妙。又某日當日機在閘北陣地投彈時。每彈約重十餘斤。如雪片而下。是時我守兵咸奮不顧身。昂首迫取其彈。彈雖幸未爆裂。然敵機已懼射而遠颺矣。鳴呼。我軍之抗敵。旣神勇如此。而卒未能驅賊於境外。雖云天意。又豈非人事哉。</p>
<h3 id="c225">王曉籟悲痛之由來 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>前日京滬滬杭甬兩路管理局。在北火車站舉行國難殉職員工追悼會時。上海市商會主席王曉籟之演說。語短而音促。含有無限悲痛之意。與參加其他追悼會時情形不同。次日籌成與其會晤。詢以追悼陣亡將士時。足下無如是之悲痛。何以昨日幾欲哭泣之故。渠謂蒞會時。目覩火車站房屋被日軍炸燬殆盡。瓦礫遍地。危牆高聳。已受鉅大激刺。王純伯讀祭文時。仿照紹興古例。抑揚宛轉。如泣如訴。觸動故鄉觀念。及聞死難員工遺族。號淘大哭時。不覺悲從中來。幾至淚下。旋見遺族中有體態龍鍾之白髮老嫗。愁眉雙鎖之青春少婦。未明世事之黃口小兒。臂纏黑紗。　集一隅。鰥寡孤獨窮無所告者。畢現眼底。人孰無情。能不傷心。照予本意。應每人贈以袁頭百枚。聊表我心。惜目前經濟能力不若前數年之寛裕。心餘力絀。徒喚奈何。日兵犯境。佩虎符有守土之責者。抱不抵抗主義。而任其長驅直入連失要地。未聞處罰。彼鐵路員工。無守土之責。能抱决死之心。於敵人飛機砲彈密集之下。矢勤矢忠。竭力維持交通。接濟後方軍運。雖頭斷臂折。骨碎胸穿而弗顧。其熱心毅力。更甚於前線勇敢之將士。可不敬歟。</p>

<p>洋洋大觀的接吻影片日本全國淫風極盛。而表面上却做得道貌岸然。宛然是一個三代以上的道義之邦。所以對於男女的接吻。也以爲是極不道德的事。凡是歐美影片。輸入他們國境的。都須經過嚴格的檢查。將所有接吻部分完全剪去。英國作家史厥里氏J·street著」神　的日本一“MysteriousJapan”一書。曾記述其事。據說那剪去影片中接吻的工作。是由日本方面聘請一位美國人主持。他見那許多擅口揾櫻　的　　風光。都付之井州一剪。未免可惜。因此特地將無數剪下的接吻斷片。連接起來。合成一大卷的接吻影片。一張張的嘴。一片片的層。接成種種方式。他有時在家裏私下放映。給朋友們觀賞。大家都說是洋洋大觀。</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>從滬西的金魚園裏回來。就帶了不少的關於金魚的故事和新聞。閒來無事。且把這些拾來的牙慧談談吧。</p>
<p>美國去的金魚　到美國路程不是很遠嗎。往來如非是郵船。船上要帶。也頗費事。但是。美國人非常信仰中國的名魚。船上的茶房就用盡心思來帶去。你知道如何帶法。他用大的木桶在天津或上海。舀上魚缸裏的原水。然後把各色的魚放進去。天氣不是有冷熱嗎。他們就非常當心的使得放魚桶那間艙裏。熱天用冷氣或冰塊。冷天用火爐或水汀。總之要使他的温度相稱。那才可以安然的到美國舊金山和紐約去。喫食呢。天津那裏有水蛆乾買。據說每斤要一元六毛錢。所以運到美國去了。金魚仍舊不致瘦餓而死。那種帶魚的賣買。也是船上茶房的一椿好生意呢。</p>
<p>徐國樑的金魚　那個老漁人。從前在北平養魚爲生。是已故淞滬警察廳長徐國樑將軍帶來。他老人家到了上海。就跟徐將軍服伺幾十缸的細種。後來將軍遇害。侍從星散。這許多魚就被已過的黃楚九先生買去。放在大世界供養。後來漸漸的賣完。大宗的一批。是買給一度叙過次長的穆先生。穆先生當時尙在上海。把那些魚倒也珍如拱璧。不久榮膺權寄。仍舊东惜運費。把最心愛的幾缸搬到首都去。據說現在京滬兩處。還是有許多存在呢。老漁人滔滔不絶地講給我聽。等到有暇的時候。再記出來吧。</p>

<p>凡亂離之世。每多奇士。歷史上如漢魏之際。宋元之間。明清之交。嶔崎磊落。倜儻風流。或以藝鳴。或以品立者。殊不少也。如稽阮魏黃顧朱諸儔。可得而數焉。予友陳子小蝶。亦今之奇士也。虞翻著書。譽起早年。元龍湖海。目無餘子。年來遨遊山川。性習猿鶴。揮毫寫形。吳裝傳江陵粉本。大痴之奇。仲圭之雄。盡得其神。故其逸志烟高。俊情月澹。浮雲富貴。脫略塵俗矣。日前自匡廬歸。與瘦鐵合作扇面多頁。觀瀑圖一筆。題曰。我自匡廬看瀑回。胸中奇氣多凌亂。叔厓眎我一尺紙。斗室未展光已满。攅岏老樹僅一叢。野老負手眉目短。石濤之魂石溪魄。抱醉狂歌呼不轉。爲君添作天池圖。石壁千仞泉百丈。何當與君入畫中。終年坐臥不須返。讀此詩。其志可見矣。此　現陳列南京路大慶里美術欣賞社扇面展覽會中。珠聯璧合。神追造化。蓋非凡品也。</p>

<p>— 李洣</p>
<p>馬相老原物談話。謂琥珀拾芥磁石引針二語。在漢朝時早已發見。曹君仲淵淵因摭錄英文無線電學書所載吾國郭璞發明物理。具有此說。貽書相老。詢其原始。而相老作答。謂見於王弼易注。愚按相老所引易注云云。乃唐初孔頴逹正義而誤以爲魏王弼注文也。攷拾芥引針二語。最初見於王充論衡亂龍篇。其言曰頓牟掇芥。磁石引針。皆以眞是。不假他類。並述劉子駿掌　祭典土龍事。桓君山難以頓牟磁石。不能眞是。何能掇針取芥子。駿窮無以應一段故實。是在西漢末已有此二語。王充爲班彪弟子。當肅宗時。年漸七十。其視劉桓。乃先後輩。相老調發見於漢朝。雖未能質言。而要爲暗合也。顧不曰琥珀拾芥。而曰頓牟拾芥。頓牟卽玳琄。郭璞山海經圖讚琥珀拾芥句。琥珀一作玳琄。然琥珀摩熱可以拾芥。顯出經騐。相傳至今。而代琄從無拾芥之實證。愚意琥珀產於西域。班固漢書傳謂出　賓魚拳。魏典略謂出大秦。其非中土所有甚明。漢武帝寳鼎元年。西方貢珍怪有琥珀燕。見王嘉拾遺記。宣帝有身毒寳鏡。以虎珀筒盛之。見吳均西京雜記。並以希爲貴耳。蓋當劉桓時去武宣未遠。物非習睹。名無定稱。以琥珀光瑩類玳琄。遂繆以頓牟目之。非玳琄眞能拾芥。更多一物理發明也。三國志虞翻傳注引韋昭吳書。翻年十二與人書云。僕聞虎魄不取腐芥。磁石不受曲針。過而不存。不亦宜乎。此作琥珀不誤。翻於是時則在東漢末矣。迨晉郭璞注山海經。又譔圖讚。其北山經圖磁石讚云。磁石吸鐵。琥珀拾芥。氣有濳感。數亦冥會。物之相投。出乎意外。按璞此讚。實本於董仲舒春秋繫露郊語篇。慈石取鐵。眞金取火。奇而可怪。非人所意數語。至璞圖讚二卷。原本久佚。道藏有之。非其舊也。明張漙輯郭弘農集。卽據藏本。備載讚文。此正曹君所詢之出處。而相老漏未舉似者。惟英文電學書以爲創論於郭璞。在第四世紀。殊不知雅故流傳。遠有端緒。郭璞之前則虞翻。翻之前則王充。充之前則劉歆桓譚。劉桓爲哀平間人。乃在西紀開始時。是不可不知也。又琥珀不產於中土。其發明拾芥。當在西漢時。若磁石始見於神農本草經。至黃帝造司南車。卽已發明吸鐵之理。惟本草書稱磁石指南。常偏丙位。以丙爲大火。庚辛金受其制。則不免傅會耳。如呂氏春秋精通篇云。慈石召鐵。或引之也。不韋但言磁石而不及琥珀。可爲秦時尙無琥珀之證。是又拾芥引針二語。連類屬辭。雖起於西漢末年。而物理發明。時代先後。實有其故。抑不可不知也。索居無俚。拉雜記之。以廣相老未備。且解曹君之惑。</p>
<p>李時珍本草綱目云。琥珀拾芥乃草芥。卽禾草。雷　言拾芥子誤據英文書。詞意似亦作芥子也。又郭璞磁石讚藝文類聚卷六引載其文非白孔六帖也。附告曹君。並資攷證。</p>

<p>第十一回　偏估小邑瞻仰牙旌　猥瑣羣流呵從騶</p>
<p>在第十回本書的末尾。安玉田剛見着了葉作章。把招撫的差事大致說妥。回到旅館後。與梁笑雲詳細說知。梁笑雲一聽這公事是已由葉作章面交給了參謀長辦。便主張要給與經辦人參謀長一點面子。呌安玉田第二天就專去拜見參謀長。面懇他多多指敎。事事照應。早把這公文辦妥發下。以便急速進行。這位參謀長的姓名。呌白善勛。在葉作章所有部下高級軍官中。算是庸中佼佼。出身於留學日本士官。倒非渾天糊塗之輩。但旣已依附軍閥當參謀長。遇事總得承順主管的意旨。見了安玉田後。只板着面孔冷冷的說道。我這人是最隨和不過的。老將呌我辦個什麽。我總是只有照辦。不另參其他意見。你那公文。一半天辦好後准派人給你送去。餘下的事。等將來再說罷。說過。依然在他那寫字檯邊的座位上。提起筆來照常批閱文件。不再答理安玉田了。安玉田不便多打擾他。悏　辭出。他略爲點點頭。也並不起身相送。好在安玉田此時已多少增進了點閱歷。知道這白參謀長所以給橡皮釘子給他碰。并非眞是不满意他或瞧不起他。無非仍是什麽禮物人情的問題在作怪。回來與梁笑雲再商量過。本打算仍沿用應付萬承啓處長的老法子。另多打通這條路。郤不料公文隔一天竟自送到。賞了傳逹兵十塊錢。把公文留下。緊接着旅館中賬房執事及茶房汽車夫等。全得着了這信息。紛紛前來賀喜。兩夫妻那麽一歡喜。就暫把打點白參謀長那件事擱置下了。隨後又忙了兩天。一同上衙門面謝過葉作章和五太太。并到處拜了些客。將督署中所有重要人員。全行聯絡到。這才漸漸清閒下來。</p>

<p>滬南　昨日各帮來船仍祗十號、浦存漸薄、城鄉店舗乃緣來貨日稀、况國歷大月底、行號雙方結束歸賬之期、交易不佳、常錫北粳與蘇同帮各提二角、薄稻銷雖不暢、因貨零星、市價亦提角許、洋杜尖到銷二平、市面平庸、變元貸竟寥寥、但去胃呆滯、洋米天津帮略辦、本街仍覺平常、致價暫居穏象、</p>

<h3 id="c247">漂白粉製造法（上） <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 允釐</p>
<p>漂白絲毛綿蔴紙張等物，有鹽素，重鉻酸鉀，過酸化鈉，過酸化　，過錳酸鉀，漂白粉等漂白劑。這些漂白劑中最通用的是漂白粉。漂白粉不但有漂白的功用，並且有殺菌的效力，所以是很有益於人類的。我現在要把製造漂白粉的方法介紹一下：</p>
<p>（一）原料漂白粉的原料，是氯氣和石灰兩種。要製造漂白粉，先要預備氯氣和石灰。</p>
<p>（甲）氯氣製造法｜｜將四分鹽酸和一分二氧化錳放入燒瓶内。用個有孔的軟木塞塞緊瓶口。然後用根曲玻璃管或橡皮管，一端挿入軟木塞的孔内，又一端預備挿入製漂白粉箱上部或下部的孔中。這樣預備好後，便將燒瓶架在一個三脚架上，放在木箱傍，等製造漂白粉時，用酒精燈在燒瓶下面加熱，就有氯氣由玻璃管流入箱中。</p>
<p>（乙）石灰選擇法｜｜石灰的良惡和漂白粉的成品大有關係。製造時宜選擇燒透的石灰塊，尤以初燒出的新石灰爲宜，萬不可用久曝空氣中的散石灰。因爲散開的石灰已吸有濕氣，就不能吸受多量的氯氣。石灰選好後，宜洒清水使之潮潤裂開，成爲粉末。若有未燒透之硬塊，須用篩子篩去。但要注意｜水不可洒之過濕或不匀。若過濕便成灰乳，不能應用。若不匀，則製漂白粉時，吸收氯氣之力薄弱。</p>
<p>（二）製造箱之佈置法　　製造漂白粉可用長約一尺五寸，高約二尺七寸之木箱一只。箱内四周釘满鉛皮，以免侵壞。箱的中問用木板隔成六七層，每層的距離約四寸。但這木板要裝置活動，以便石灰之放入或取出。箱的兩頭須開三四寸見方小玻璃窗各一個，以便觀看氯氣通入箱内時和石灰化合的形狀。箱之上下部宜各開一小孔，以備導入氯氣之用。但玻璃管挿在上部上孔時，下孔宜緊閉。若將玻璃管更換挿入下孔内，就宜緊閉上孔。這樣預備好後，就算成功了。</p>
<p>莫名奇妙</p>

<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>你如果從馬路上走過，有時候你可以在宅門口或者弄堂口，看見懸掛着ＸＸ票房或ＸＸ社：：等各式的招牌，在夜晚的時候，從這些懸掛招牌的屋子裏面，還會透出一陣陣鑼鼓胡琴的聲音你要是被好奇心所引動，跑進裏面去參觀，你可以看見這些屋子裏面，充满了許多人，坐着的，立着的，：：各式俱備。這些人上自洋行職員，下至書寓阿媛，一應俱全。此外還可以看見幾位怪頭怪腦的講戲敎師，和幾位滑頭滑腦的操琴打鼓樂師。</p>
<p>「老王唱一隻」！於是被喊爲老王的，就喝一口茶，潤潤喉嚨，關照琴師拉起胡琴，拉着就一陣「店主東帶過了黃驃馬：：」唱完一叚，他不用說是唱的狠得意，但他照例却要謙遜幾句，其他的人也在照例的恭維着，雖然在他們名人的心裏充满着很多的：：「你唱的賣馬旣不是譚腔又不是余腔」，「你第二句不該在中眼上落板」，「你唱那個長腔應該換氣」：：等等不满和輕視。</p>
<p>你如果在那些房子裏巡視，在掛在壁上的華美鏡框中，你可以看見他們圑體組織的表章，宗旨項下大書特書着：「本社以研究藝術聯絡感情爲宗旨」那時你的腦海裏不免要起了疑問，「這算研究甚麽藝術呢？聯絡甚麽情感呢？」</p>
<p>你要是不願意多事逗留，和作進一步的考察，那你就離開那個所在吧，你走出那些喧囂烟塵的房子，你到外面可以大吸一口新鮮的空氣。</p>

<h3 id="c249">房東太太的煩悶 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>亭子間空了一個多月了；到今天才由一個十七八歲學生模樣的青年以每月六塊錢的房金賃了它。房東太太站在院子裏覷著那個青年指揮車夫在搬他的簡單的傢具和行李。她覺得映在她眼簾中的青年和她昨夜夢裏的那個可愛的青年一樣：她的比她長十二歲的丈夫在輪船上服務，一個月只回來三四天。只有二十一歲的她，白天看著左右鄰居那有年青的成雙作對的夫妻們，心裏常常翻起一陣妬恨的波浪；夜裏她一個人孤寂的睡在床上，全身往往受一般莫名的煩悶的襲擊，而且隔壁傳來的年青夫妻們的歡笑聲，更是使她難堪，以爲他們予她以極大的侮辱。所以她就以左右鄰居的某一個青年男人做她的追求快樂的對象，而幻成桃色的夢；在夢裏她得到甜蜜的吻，擁抱，愛的喜謔和肉的狂歡。今天她家裏突然搬來了一個青年，她想這是上帝的賜予。這一個十七八歲的青年，在她以爲是一個小孩子｜一個没有受過戀愛的洗禮的孩子，只要稍爲讓他嚐點兒愛的滋味，自已便可以得著青春的享樂了。她胡思亂想的想著，猛然聽見那個青年低低的對她說道：</p>
<p>「東西搬完了。大門要關上麽？」　　「哦：：哦：：哦：：」她不知道她嘴裏說些什麽，臉上辣辣的發燒。她定了一定神，向他很嫵媚的微微一笑，紅暈著面　慢慢的走過去關上大門。她不自主的跟他走到亭子間。</p>
<p>她在他屋子裏，閒談了一會兒；知道他在離她家不遠的一個中學讀書。因道他在離她家不遠的一個中學讀書。因爲校中的宿舍已經全住满了人，所以他才住在校外的；不過一等到正在建築的新宿舍完工，他便搬進去住了。她希望這一座新宿舍在她和他已經沉醉在愛之河裏再完工，那時他在她的懷抱裏，不至於忍心搬走了罷。</p>
<p>在早晨，她給他打臉水，收拾被褥。下午他回來，她特爲他親手做了幾樣菜，留著他一起吃晚飯。和他東拉西扯的閒談，自已也奇怪怎麽話老是說不完的。有時，給他幾個暗示；這暗示把她的希望，對他的熱烈的愛情全包括在這裏面。而他彷彿是一個傻瓜似的一點兒也没有什麽表示，似乎没有感覺到她的暗示。他又給她的幾次露骨的愛的表示和異性的强烈的誘惑壓迫得他低下了頭，紅著臉覺得自已的脈搏跳得很厲害。她覷著他這般模樣，雖然很覺到觖望，可是她明白他還是小孩子似的害羞，他那顆童心還没有給愛神的利箭所射中。然而，不知道什麽緣故，她夜裏更睡不著了，連甜蜜的夢也没有了，心裏只有不可忍受的煩悶。</p>
<p>他在這樣充满異性的刺激的零氛中過了二十多天。有時他眞窒息得難受；然而有時他又以爲心田上灌漑著愛的甘露，也許有這麽一天會把愛的嫩苗的甘露，也許有這麽一天會把愛的嫩苗生長出來。一天，他下午回來，在門口没有看見每日歡迎他的她。便透著奇怪。進了門，在院子裏，在自已的屋子裏全没有她的影子。他放了書，才坐在椅子上，她便進來了。低聲笑著說：</p>
<p>「今天從鄉裏來了兩個親戚。眞討厭。她們要在這兒住上十多天啦！」說完了，她就笑著走了。</p>
<p>自從她的親戚來了以後，他就難得和她說話了；被褥也得自已收拾了；她也不和他在一起吃飯了。他反而覺著没有她在旁邊，嘮嘮叨叨的說個不停，生活清靜得多了。到了第四天，抱歉似的對她說：</p>
<p>「學校的新宿舍已經完工了。我要搬進去住了。」</p>
<p>她站在她親戚身旁，睜著一雙觖望的大眼，臉上浮著煩悶的微笑，覷著他指揮車夫搬著他的簡單的傢具和行李去了。</p>
<p>胡說</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>前天的晚飯後，我的母親，戲問一個鄉下初出來，未曾在社會中受過洗禮的娘姨道：「你知道我今年多少年幾？」那娘姨答道：「我瞧太太至少有六十多歲了。」我們在旁聽了，都不禁哄然大笑，我的母親也一樣的笑着。因爲我們瞧那個娘姨，實在誠實得好笑，其實我的母親，還未满六十歲，在别人當然說：「太太年輕哩。」而她却說：「太太至少有六十多歲。」安得不令人好笑？其實在她也許另有一種心理，以爲年歲太，是福氣好，並没有說錯：然而，那裏知道，反博得我們一個哄堂大笑，使她莫明其妙。</p>
<p>因此，我覺得一個人之不願老，這種心理，是最普遍，往往有些人，確已老了，而他偏要人家說他年輕，尤其是婦女們，大都有這種心理。但是有種人，却要依老賣老，老氣橫秋，雖年未半百，倒偏要人家說他年老，甚而自稱「老夫，」或「老娘，」如果有人說一聲「年輕，」就要不高興；那末那個娘姨，所以要說我的母親，年幾有六十多歲，也許是她這種心理的表示。但是人們的心理，各有不同，她以爲說得對的，别人却以爲是不對的，好笑的。我於此一椿小小的無關緊要的事情上，就要感想到做人之對於說話，也非要有藝術不可，尤其是在現代的社會上，否則不能迎合人們的心理，就是一個「阿木林」！</p>

<h3 id="e1">How Young People Should Utilize Summer Vacation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Contemporary discussions on the responsibilities of newspapers invariably state that they should critique politics, supervise politics, voice the sufferings of the people, and act as the mouthpiece of the masses. In reality, this still constitutes a passive role. We believe that rather than the newspaper being the mouthpiece of the people, it should be their school. Rather than the newspaper passively critiquing and supervising politics, it should be the active teaching material for the people, guiding them onto the path of progress and creation. A single newspaper issue circulates throughout the country, with direct readers and indirect listeners numbering perhaps hundreds of thousands. This vast and boundless school, if its role is merely to passively voice grievances and criticisms, and it cannot educate and guide the people, open up new horizons, and create a new world, then it would be betraying this vast and boundless school.</p>
<p>Furthermore, youth are the nation's vitality and the mainstay of the nation's future. By observing the youth of today, one can predict the governance or chaos of the nation in the future. "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." For the sake of "cultivating people," for the sake of nurturing the nation's future talent, newspapers should pay particular attention to the education of youth. Newspapers should be utilized as active teaching materials, establishing a close relationship with the youth.</p>
<p>Currently, the summer vacation has arrived. Schools across the country will be on break. However, the nation is in crisis. Internally, the floods have not yet subsided. Externally, powerful enemies are pressing our borders. The rivers and mountains beyond the Great Wall have changed color. The pain of the Shanghai Incident is still fresh. The nation has reached a point of life or death. Our people must endure hardship and cultivate the strength for struggle. How can we speak of vacations? It would be a great pity to allow the two months of vacation to be wasted. Therefore, many educators have suggested to this newspaper that we encourage young people to utilize the summer vacation to engage in planned work through a writing contest. This would cultivate in young people the habit of planning, and it would also allow the newspaper to establish a close relationship with them. This newspaper has accepted this meaningful and valuable suggestion and is now holding a summer writing contest.</p>
<p>The theme of this writing contest is "The Summer Work Plan and Work Report for the 21st Year of the Republic of China." The intention behind this theme is to emphasize engaging in planned work during the summer vacation. We believe that planning is the mother of all facts, and also the key to success. This holds true for a nation's politics and also for an individual's career. If a nation's politics are without a plan, they will be as tangled as silk threads. If an individual's career is without a plan, there will be no way to progress. This writing contest is exclusively for male and female students of all sizes and levels throughout the country. We believe that university students should have large-scale work plans, and even primary school students should have small-scale work plans. Those who dedicate their summer vacation to social work should have their plans. Those who dedicate their summer vacation to their personal studies should also have their plans. A life without a plan is a life without vitality and meaning, aimless and without a destination. This is something that we dare to hope that all young people will pay special attention to.</p>
<p>However, having a plan is valuable, but being able to put it into practice is even more valuable. Devising ideas behind closed doors and engaging in armchair strategy—what plan could not be accomplished? But if a plan is left on paper for a long time and cannot be put into practice, then what is the use of the plan? Therefore, this newspaper not only deeply hopes that all students can formulate a detailed plan at the beginning of the summer vacation, but also hopes that at the end of the summer vacation, they will contribute the actual work of realizing this plan to society. The reason why the writing contest theme is divided into two items, plan and report, is for this very purpose.</p>
<p>This newspaper believes that this writing contest is not the same as a civil service examination-style test, nor is it the same as a trophy-style competition. It has extremely significant educational meaning. We deeply hope that educators and enlightened fathers and elder brothers throughout the country will jointly promote it and provide it with strong support.</p>
<p>As for all the detailed regulations for the writing contest, they are all published in today's newspaper's education news column. Please read them carefully.</p>

<p>(Qinhuangdao) The volunteer armies in the Liaoxi area have recently established contact and adopted a guerrilla warfare strategy. The area within ten miles of the railway line is within the sphere of influence of the volunteer army. The Japanese troops, having suffered repeated defeats in engagements, have not dared to advance lightly. Most of them are now concentrated between Dahushan and Goubangzi, and the警戒 is extremely strict, fearing an attack by the volunteer army. Recently, the Japanese troops have also changed their strategy. Whenever they hear an alarm, they send planes to bomb, so many civilian houses have been destroyed. The Japanese troops also search everywhere in the name of searching for the volunteer army, burning and looting everything, which is extremely cruel. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

Although they have intimidated in many ways, the Chinese customs officials of the Binjiang Customs have jointly refused to hand over or serve. The other customs, such as Andong and Shenyang, are the same as Binjiang. The Hunchun Customs is in the hands of our volunteer army, so it is still working as usual.

<p>(Nanjing) Although Zhongda held classes as usual, no one is responsible for school reorganization, etc. The student union issued an urgent notice saying that the school is unfortunate and has suffered setbacks. Yesterday's newspapers reported that the Executive Yuan has resolved to temporarily dissolve the six colleges in Nanjing. The life of our supreme institution of higher learning is proclaimed to be at its end. For the sake of the school's future, the union urges all students to study peacefully and maintain order before receiving a government order. It also hopes that the school protection committee will immediately be responsible for appealing to the government to withdraw its order. In addition to sending letters to all professors, unanimously advocating for the same, the union will devise a method to jointly plan for the aftermath. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Zhongda student union telegraphed Cai Yuanpei and Wu Zhihui, saying that the position of the school president has been vacant for a long time, funding is insufficient, and school administration is in a desperate situation. For a year, the students have been running around and appealing, hoping that the government will resolve this matter as soon as possible so that Zhongda can get on track. Unexpectedly, the government cannot understand the students' painstaking efforts, resulting in the unfortunate incident of all the students expelling Duan Xipeng on the morning of the 29th. Now the government has explicitly ordered the dissolution of the school, and the future is extremely bleak. The students of the school have always admired you as national elders and academic leaders, and earnestly ask you to show your enthusiasm for protecting education and take on the task of mediation. All of our students will be happy to accept it. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Someone from the student union stated that the actions of a few students were inappropriate, leading to an unprecedented serious situation.

<h3 id="e36">Premier Speaks <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang Jingwei made the following statement regarding the Zhongda affair: At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th of this month, the Executive Yuan appointed Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education, as the interim president of National Central University. This matter has a difficult story behind it. On January 26th, Ren Hongjun was appointed as the president of Zhongda, but Ren was not consulted in advance, so the matter was delayed for several months and he never took office. Liu Guanghua, the Dean of the Law School, was acting as the president, but some students made things difficult for him, so he became passive. These students also requested that Provost Zha Qian act as president. When Liu left the school, Zha had already acted on his behalf, so it would have been fine to appoint Zha as the acting president when Liu resigned. However, some students have expressed their opposition to one or the other, and if everything were to be done according to their wishes, not only would educational administration be impossible to rectify, but it would also cause resentment among other students, making the problem even more incomprehensible. Therefore, the Executive Yuan agreed to seek another candidate for president to solve the problem, but even if a candidate is decided, without seeking their consent, the same mistake as with Ren's appointment would be made. Seeking consent cannot be done overnight, and the summer vacation is approaching, so all school affairs should not be left vacant. Therefore, before a formal announcement of the candidate for president, Duan had to be appointed as the interim president. Under such terrible circumstances, no one could avoid being opposed by one or the other. Many people in the education field are self-respecting, who would lightly try it? Moreover, these short-term transitions cannot be forced on anyone. Apart from the educational administrative authorities being responsible for upholding this, there is really no other way. Therefore, although Duan repeatedly pleaded to resign, the Executive Yuan insisted on him taking on the role. Duan's final decision to resolutely take office was purely out of a sense of sacrifice and service, which we deeply admire. For months, some students have been clamoring about the president problem. I and Minister Zhu have repeatedly given them earnest advice, and even if there are extreme remarks, we have forgiven them, but unexpectedly, this has led to the riot on the morning of the 29th, where university students publicly gathered and injured the president. School discipline has been completely lost, and they have even violated criminal law. This is something that I must severely correct with a heavy heart. For months, students in various places have been acting out of line from time to time, using the funding problem and the president problem as excuses. Although the government is concerned about the shortage of educational funding, since the January 28th Incident, military and political expenses have all been cut by 50%, and educational funding is not the only one. Moreover, the government is working hard to ensure that educational funding is secured. As for the president, if students were to choose them, it would be like electing the speaker of a parliament, which would be extremely ridiculous. If they are allowed to do so, then there will be no end to opposition and infighting. Moreover, if they are slightly dissatisfied, they will threaten to strike, and even lead students to violently attack teachers, causing them to bleed and suffer injuries. Ask yourself, who would be willing to be a teacher? You must know that the relationship between students and the school is different from the relationship between workers and the factory. A strike may harm the factory owner, but a strike is the same as truancy, what is the point? As for corporal punishment, which teachers used to inflict on students, now students are inflicting on teachers, which is even more bizarre. This kind of clamorous trend has been growing for some time, and the determination to rectify it cannot be delayed. I am willing to work with those in the country who care about education to work together on this. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>To Study Reparations, Economic Difficulties and Prepare Reports</p>
<p>Rumors that Germany Has Agreed to the Principle of Paying a Lump Sum</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 29th – The Lausanne Conference faced the prospect of collapse this morning after German Chancellor Papen announced the condition of revising the treaty as the price for resuming payments. However, thanks to the efforts of British Prime Minister MacDonald's mediation, the situation has turned around again. Leading politicians have been meeting all day. Although there is still no sign of the French and German positions moving closer, the conference's life has been sustained and will continue for at least another week. A member of the German delegation has denied the rumors that Germany would be willing to pay 3 billion marks as a voluntary contribution to the post-war financial and economic recovery of Europe if discriminatory clauses in the Treaty of Versailles were removed. Direct Franco-German negotiations have been temporarily suspended. Today, the British, German, and French Prime Ministers consulted all day until the Six-Nation Conference. The Six-Nation Conference resulted in the formation of two committees: a core committee, composed of two representatives from each of the six nations, chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald, and a commercial committee, composed of the financial authorities of the six nations, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans. The core committee will now prepare a report based on the Basel experts' report, discussing the reparations issue, describing the proposals of various countries and the possibilities of their resolution. It is expected that a draft may be ready by tomorrow night.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 29th – The Lausanne Conference, after encountering difficulties and reaching a deadlock, has decided to divide the conference into two parts as a result of tonight's meeting of the six inviting nations: (1) a core committee of six members to discuss reparations and preside over the conference; (2) a commercial committee, composed of the ministers or directors-general of commerce of various countries, to prepare a report to be submitted to the World Economic Conference this autumn. According to this arrangement, even if the reparations negotiations fail, the commercial committee will continue to work. From a technical point of view, the Lausanne Conference can still be considered to exist. As for the reparations negotiations, according to French Prime Minister Herriot, speaking to a reporter from the French newspaper *Le Temps* today, a part of the principled questions has been resolved. Germany has agreed in principle to pay a lump sum in the future. The details will be discussed by the core committee. British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Herriot, German Chancellor Papen, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi met at the Beau Rivage Hotel this afternoon at 4:00 PM, and then walked along the lake to the Hotel du Lac, where they were joined by the Belgian and Japanese representatives to begin the Six-Nation Conference, which lasted until 12:45 AM. At that time, rumors abounded, with some saying that there had been a complete breakdown, and others saying that there had been a final compromise. It was later learned that the question of whether Germany would pay a lump sum had not yet been definitively decided and that negotiations would resume tonight at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Havas, Lausanne, 29th – News Release: "The leaders of the delegations of the six inviting nations, each leading their national delegations, met at the Palace Hotel at 7:00 PM. The chairman of the conference made a presentation on the progress of the conference's work. The explanatory document will be published shortly. As there has been a preliminary study of the reparations issue, the representatives have decided to organize an office to further study the current situation of the reparations issue based on the results of the preliminary study. The leaders of the delegations have also requested the ministers of commerce of the initiating countries to meet in order to discuss a number of issues related to the second step of responsibility undertaken by the Lausanne Conference. In other words, they will discuss what necessary measures should be taken to alleviate the economic and financial problems that are causing or threatening to prolong the world panic. When a conference to study this issue is convened in the future, it will be based on the results of the meetings of the ministers of commerce. If it is necessary for the International Bank for Settlements to participate in the specialized work of the conference, the chairman has full authority to request the bank to send representatives to Lausanne."</p>

<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 30th – After the reparations conference's office committee met at midnight, an agreement was reached in principle. There is now a renewed sense of optimism here, and it is hoped that this agreement will bridge the differences between France and Germany. Germany has not rejected the ideal of a reduced total payment, but insists that this should be seen as a contribution to European recovery funds. This morning, a new twist arose during the office committee's discussions on the total amount that Germany should provide for European economic recovery. Germany is willing to provide 2 billion marks, while France is demanding 7 billion. The German delegation is currently discussing this point. It is now known that Britain has sided with France's demand for guarantees regarding American war debts.</p>

<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 29th – It is reported that British Prime Minister MacDonald, because of Papen's inflexible attitude after returning from Berlin, is gradually leaning towards the French viewpoint, believing that Germany should make some concessions on the reparations issue. The British Prime Minister is still actively working to revive the fate of the reparations conference. Although he personally remains optimistic, the general sentiment is indeed pessimistic. After a heated debate between the German and French representatives last night, the atmosphere is not as tense as before. The office committee and commercial committee established by the six major powers have immediately begun work, but there has been no announcement that principled questions have been resolved. It is now clear that some people have suggested studying this difficult problem from other angles. The British Prime Minister has not shown any signs of discouragement, and still says that things are progressing smoothly, and French Prime Minister Herriot is also optimistic, claiming to be an optimist. Another French representative, in answering the question of whether the reparations conference would continue, said that it would continue to be held in the future.</p>

<p>Havas, Lausanne, 29th – This evening, the situation at the Lausanne Conference is still chaotic, but Chancellor Papen's insistence on not yielding has strengthened the solidarity among Germany's creditor nations. British Prime Minister, in his capacity as chairman of the Lausanne Conference, asked the representatives of the initiating countries whether they would be prepared to waive reparations and sign a agreement if they stipulated "a lump sum" for Germany to pay off, and no further payments would be made thereafter. The answer was yes, but the German Finance Minister remained silent, indicating that the creditor nations have formed a united front to deal with Germany. The reason for this may be that the countries have not forgotten that they are all debtors to the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e102">US Democratic Party Convention Passes Important Platform <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Advocating the Repeal of Prohibition</p>
<p>Emphasizing Economic Issues</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 29th – The Democratic Party Convention opened here today, passing the proposal to repeal Prohibition amid cheers, as an important plank in the presidential election campaign. Both the Republican and Democratic parties now advocate the repeal of Prohibition, as the Republican Party Convention had previously passed a proposal to abolish Prohibition and replace it with central management by a vote of 681 to 572.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 29th – The Democratic Party Convention continued to pass the following platform: (1) to convene an international economic conference; (2) to mutually reduce tariffs; (3) to amend the national tax; (4) to hold an international monetary conference to consider raising the price of silver and related issues; (5) to maintain a stable currency; (6) to balance the budget; (7) to agree to consult each other in the event of a treaty breach, in order to maintain the effectiveness of the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (8) to grant independence to the Philippines; (9) to establish an international agreement on disarmament.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 29th – The Democratic Party Platform Committee today passed the platform to repeal Prohibition by a vote of 35 to 18. This decision was unexpected, as it was previously expected that the Platform Committee, which was dominated by Roosevelt, would try to avoid the Democratic Party from being firmly bound by the repeal of Prohibition. The second proposal passed by the committee was a declaration against the abolition of war debts, which was expected, as otherwise the party's prospects in several Midwestern states would be adversely affected.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Hoover's Disarmament Plan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Britain Prepares to Accept with Reservations</p>
<p>Japan Expresses Absolute Opposition</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 29th – There is talk that the disarmament conference may be extended to November or January of next year. It is now speculated here that the conference may be extended by mid-July if the representatives can find a satisfactory solution. British Foreign Minister Simon had a long talk with US Chief Delegate Gibson today. It is reported that Simon told Gibson that Britain is prepared to accept President Hoover's disarmament plan in principle, but with reservations, the nature of which has not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication, Tokyo, 30th – As a result of studying Hoover's proposal to reduce the naval strength stipulated under existing treaties by one-third, the Japanese Navy believes that the American proposal is self-serving and unfair, and resolutely opposes it. This has been instructed to the Japanese Plenipotentiary in Geneva. The Japanese Navy's arguments against the proposal can be divided into the following four points: (1) Hoover's proposal does not take into account the research of the League of Nations Disarmament Preparatory Commission over the past six years, and the results of the research of the representatives of various countries since the opening of the disarmament conference in February of this year, but only expresses the American position. (2) Although Hoover's proposal states that the relative relations of the military preparations of various countries should be expressed, and that the reason for reducing military preparations by one-third should be based on the strength of the London Naval Treaty, which is a temporary agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan in 1930, the result is either that military preparations must be expanded, or that military preparations must be reduced, or even that military preparations must be destroyed, which is very unfair. (3) The London Treaty is a temporary agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan, stipulating the strength of the military until 1936. If it is applied to countries other than the above three countries, or if it restricts the amount of military force to be retained after 1936, Japan is absolutely opposed. (4) According to Hoover's proposal, although the United States claims that it must abandon 300,000 tons of warships, the content is all old fleets that have exceeded their age, and only those that should be abandoned are abandoned. As for those whose ship age is not full, not only has not one ship been abandoned, but it also retains the power of newly built fleets. On the other hand, if Japan agrees to this proposal, Japan must abandon 43 ships in addition to the London Treaty. Therefore, Japan cannot build a single ship from 1934 to 1936, and Japan cannot retain a military force for the purpose of complete self-defense. This is especially what Japan is absolutely opposed to.</p>

<p>Japanese United News, Tokyo, 30th – Japan's foreign trade, which had a monthly trade deficit since the beginning of the year, turned to a surplus in the sixth month. Trade in late June created a surplus of 10 million yuan. The main reason is that cotton imports have entered a slack period, and the import of other important import goods such as wool fertilizer soybean cake has come to an end. The import of wood and groceries is gradually decreasing. On the export side, raw silk is still at the amount of 14,000 bales, and cotton textiles have reached a record figure of 9.66 million yuan due to the fall of the Japanese exchange rate.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Tokyo *Manchōhō* Discusses the Second World War <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Advocating Taking the Offensive Against the United States First</p>
<p>Seizing Maritime Power in the Pacific</p>
<p>Occupying the Philippines and Hawaii</p>
<p>As Easy as Reaching into a Pocket</p>
<p>The *Tokyo Manchōhō* recently published an article discussing the Second World War. The translation is as follows, in order to show the Japanese perspective: (1) The Focus of World Diplomacy Shifts to the Pacific – The confrontation of European countries centered on the Mediterranean Sea, and the rivalry between Britain and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean, have become past facts of diplomacy. Today, the opposition between Japan, the United States, and Russia, centered on the Chinese mainland, and the intensification of political and economic issues, are even greater than in the past. In essence, the so-called Pacific situation has become the focus of world diplomacy. In this major situation, Japan's foreign policy should be based on all the phenomena on the Chinese mainland, and there is no doubt that it should establish and implement a direction. What, after all, is the essence of the opposition between Japan, the United States, and Russia, centered on the Chinese mainland? The world often says that the crisis between Japan and the United States started with the Manchurian Incident last autumn, but in fact, the hidden danger between Japan and the United States was in a precarious situation several times after the Russo-Japanese War. For example, the Korean independence movement and the anti-Japanese issue in Southern California, etc., have long made Japan's feelings towards the United States icy and coal-like. Until the Russo-Japanese War, the United States openly abandoned the Atlantic Ocean and shifted its gaze to the Chinese mainland in the Pacific Ocean. At that time, the United States used the open door and equal opportunity in Manchuria as slogans for the Russo-Japanese War. John Hay's strong effort to steer world opinion towards the Manchurian proposition was especially the most obvious point of its intention. However, although the United States schemed in this way, in fact, Manchuria has passed through 25 long years, until today, whether it is industry, commerce, or investment, the fact that its position has been monopolized by Japan is also due to geographical relations. The biggest point is that the political and military power of the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway has become firmly established. Remembering the attempts by the United States after the Treaty of Portsmouth to buy the South Manchuria Railway, infringe on the South Manchuria Railway's monopoly, lay the Jinai Railway, and advocate the neutrality of the South Manchuria Railway, etc., all focus on the Manchurian and Mongolian problems. Unfortunately, Japan's power has already been established, and the United States was still feeling uneasy about the environment in the Atlantic at that time, so it was unable to concentrate on expanding its power in the Pacific. Since the outbreak of the European War, the United States has taken the opportunity to develop towards the Chinese mainland. It once declared: "The policy of the United States is to solve the permanent security and peace of China, to strive to maintain the security of China's territory and administration, and to guarantee all the rights of friendly countries in accordance with treaties and international law, so as to establish an impartial principle of commerce throughout China." This declaration was the beginning of the United States' support for its power in the Asian continent. By the time of the World War, the United States' trade with China gradually expanded, but at the same time, Japan had monopolized the East Asian market, so it was quite jealous of the United States. At this time, the conflict of interests between Japan and the United States has become unavoidable. Unexpectedly, the Manchurian Incident broke out, and the imperial army occupied all the main areas of Manchuria. The United States, harboring private grievances, then proposed the Non-War Treaty to prevent the action of our army. At the time of the Jinzhou attack, the United States again used the Nine-Power Treaty to stir up the world's attention and restrict the action of our army. After the establishment of the new state of Manchuria, the United States instigated the League of Nations to hinder the development of the state of Manchuria. All kinds of attitudes have made our people resentful. Although, the empire's claim to Manchuria will never change due to its obstruction. No third country can interfere with the empire's actions. Nevertheless, the Manchurian problem cannot yet be considered safe. On one hand, we must wait for the interim report of the League of Nations to decide what to do. At the same time, we must also see what the future policy of the United States towards China will be. If it is more persistent in its preconceived notions, and wants to drive out Japan's power on the Chinese mainland, that is, to seek to succeed Britain's power in the Chinese market, so as to suppress the expansion of Japan's power, then a head-on conflict between Japan and the United States is feared to be not far away. (2) The Second World War: After the end of the European War, human society around the world, in view of the cruelty of the war, is singing the praises of peace, hoping to avoid the recurrence of tragic acts. However, when we examine in detail the past history of human struggle, if we want to seek the survival of mankind, we cannot eliminate future struggles. The recent Manchurian and Shanghai incidents are still small movements of struggle. When we deduce the causes and results of the two major incidents, we are afraid that the Second World War will be difficult to avoid. The various great powers behind a certain country are enough to destroy world peace. Moreover, in recent years, the eyes of various countries have been concentrated on the Far East, and the Liaodong Peninsula in the Far East is nothing more than the Balkans of the East. As far as northern Manchuria is concerned, it is an indispensable resource area for our survival, which coincides with a certain region centered on defending France during the European War. Therefore, we predict that in the Second World War, Japan and the United States will have a fierce struggle in the Pacific, but it is only a matter of time. Look at Britain today, building a large naval base in Singapore, and rushing to equip modern warships. Why is that? Britain's hegemony over the world with its navy is its traditional policy. It is now also in view of the changing situation in the Pacific, fearing that the equipment in Australia and New Zealand is not complete, so it has to step up its defense. The Soviet Union, which is eyeing the opportunity in the north, is also quietly watching the opportunity to advance and retreat in the Far East. Therefore, an ominous situation has suddenly appeared in the Pacific, and various crises are gradually lurking. In addition, the United States, before 1898 in the 31st year of Meiji, annexed the Hawaiian Islands and built a naval base in the Pacific. The following year, it acquired the Philippines, and the threat to Japan increased day by day. The Asian control policy that the United States holds must first conquer Japan, and Japan is suffering from overpopulation, and it has to develop outward. If the United States wants to suppress Japan's outward development, then Japan, for the sake of self-defense, cannot sit still and wait for death. It must decide the outcome with the United States. Recently, since the United States implemented anti-Japanese measures, the inevitability of the Japanese-American War has been recognized by those in the know. Recently, the concentration of the entire US fleet in the Pacific, its provocative actions, is enough to arouse the long-standing resentment of our people against the United States, and the situation is quite dangerous. When we look at the strength of the US fleet as a whole, it is weaker than our Japanese Combined Fleet. If it encounters an emergency, Japan, if it launches an offensive first, can seize the maritime power of the Pacific, occupy the Philippines and Hawaii, as easily as reaching into a pocket. At that time, if Japan attacked the Panama Canal and drove straight in, it would deeply regret interfering in the affairs of the East. In short, our Japan will not allow other countries to interfere in the Chinese problem. If peaceful methods are not easy to solve, then there is only one way to fight with force.</p>

<p>The Gong and Feng Armies Urgently Rush Towards Yushu</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Army Shifts to the Hulai Route</p>
<p>Li Du's Troops Counterattack Towards Yilan</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Lately, the battles in Jilin and Heilongjiang have become increasingly fierce. Within Jilin Province, the Self-Defense Army led by Gong and Feng, among others, has largely shifted towards Yushu and Fuyu, heading towards Changchun. The troops of Li and Ding have gathered in Boli and exited through Sanxing, while the National Salvation Army led by Wang Delin has seized Dunhua, and Jiang Haishan's troops have advanced towards Hunchun, attacking Jiandao. The Broadsword Brigade of Xing Zhanqing is scattered between Yimianpo, Ashe River, and Shuangcheng, Acheng, to contain the Japanese army, allowing the Self-Defense Army and National Salvation Army to operate. In recent times, the battles at Dongguansuo in Shuangcheng and the battles along the Qike Line (Qiqihar to Keshan via Nehe) have been the most intense. After Gong Changhai's main force attacked Harbin without success, he led his troops to Shuangcheng. One brigade of Feng Zhanhai's troops also advanced to Heituanzi, north of Shuangcheng (seventy li from Shuangcheng), to coordinate with Gong's army. The Self-Defense Army of Yang Wenlin and Yao Bingqian is scattered around Dasanjiazi, Majiagou, and other places within fifteen li of Acheng, adopting a feint attack strategy. The approximately three thousand Japanese soldiers in Acheng have therefore dared not move. On June 17th, Gong's army advanced to Dongguansuo, forty-five li east of Shuangcheng, but was unable to advance further in one go because there were no boats to cross the Lalin River. At this time, about one brigade of puppet troops in Shuangcheng, upon hearing the news, looted extensively and retreated to Yushu, leaving the city empty. The puppet county magistrate, Wei, sent an urgent telegram to the Japanese army requesting assistance. The Japanese army then dispatched the entire main force of the Nakamura Brigade early on the 18th, heading towards Shuangcheng in two branches: one to attack Gong's army at Dongguansuo, and the other to attack Feng Zhanhai's army at Heituanzi. On the 18th, the battle at Dongguansuo broke out first, with the battle line spreading across more than ten villages. Seven Japanese planes assisted in the attack, and dozens of households in Liuxiangtun village were completely destroyed by Japanese air raids. However, Gong's army calmly responded and did not retreat at all, repeatedly charging forward. The fighting was fierce until the evening, when rain suddenly fell. On the morning of the 19th, they retreated towards Sandaogou. Feng Zhanhai's army also engaged the Japanese army in the afternoon of the 18th, suffering pressure from heavy artillery and machine guns, and losing contact with Gong's brigade. They also retreated towards Lalin. On the 21st, after the two armies reunited, they bypassed Shuangcheng and advanced towards Yushu. On the 22nd, they captured the strategic Qingshanbao, sixty li from Yushu. The Liu Yushu Brigade, the 1st Garrison Brigade of the puppet troops stationed in Yushu, was ordered to attack. Liu led his troops to the outskirts of the city but dared not advance further. Currently, Gong's brigade's cavalry has turned towards Fuyu, heading for Changchun. Li Haiqing's army, from the Anda area of Heilongjiang Province, is also advancing towards the Changchun area. The two armies are coordinating with each other, so the Japanese side has transferred cavalry from Gongzhuling to that area to block them. Li Du and Ding Chao have completed replenishing their troops in Boli. The Chen Dongshan and Ying Baobin Brigades have a total of over seven thousand troops and are currently advancing overland towards Sanxing (Yilan) via Baoqing. Japanese investigations indicate that Li has a munitions factory in Boli, producing 300,000 rounds of bullets and 10,000 artillery shells per day, with ample ammunition. Wang Delin, Gong Changhai, and Feng Zhanhai's armies are all supplied with ammunition by him. It is also reported that Li's troops, upon exiting Baoqing, will not attack immediately, but intend to contain the movement of the Japanese army's Hirose Brigade, preventing them from assisting the Japanese army in eastern Heilongjiang. It is expected that there will be no battles in that area for the time being. Wang Delin's National Salvation Army's capture of Dunhua is also to coordinate with Gong Changhai's capture of Changchun. Most of the Japanese army's Second Division is stationed in Dunhua and along the Jihui Railway. When Wang's army attacked Dunhua on the 22nd, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army for a day. Wang's army eventually retreated towards Jiaohe due to a lack of bullets and is currently still confronting the nearby Japanese army. This is the situation of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers in Jilin Province over the past week. In Heilongjiang, the Japanese army, with the Amano and Hiramatsu Brigades, is advancing along the Qike Line. The Hiramatsu Brigade is advancing north from Hailun, with Baiquan and Kedong as the meeting point. Ma Zhanshan commands his troops to counterattack, and there has been fighting almost every day since June 17th. The Japanese army, unfamiliar with the geography, has been ambushed and attacked, and entire small teams have been wiped out on numerous occasions. The battle of Keshan on the 19th was particularly fierce. Ma Zhanshan personally commanded the brigades of Xu Zihe, Wu Songlin, Cai Hongyou, and Deng Wen to launch a fierce attack on Keshan. At the same time, cavalry units attacked the Japanese artillery base in Taianzhen, between Nehe and Keshan. The Japanese army's Amano Brigade, being contained in several places, could not coordinate from beginning to end. Five Japanese planes flew from Taianzhen to drop bombs, but the Black Army was scattered in the open wilderness, and the bombing was ineffective. The fierce battle lasted for sixteen hours, with the Japanese army suffering over three hundred casualties. Later, the Hiramatsu Brigade rushed to reinforce from Nahe, and the Black Army then retreated. Below Keshan, telephone communication was impossible. The Japanese army suffered from the scorching heat and the ubiquitous mud, and the soldiers all complained bitterly. Hiramatsu Brigade's artillery vehicles were stuck in Qingbeizhen north of Hailun and on the Tongken River twice on the 20th, and it took a very long time to get them out. Their supplies were also difficult to manage, so the Japanese army, having set out for many days, has not been able to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. On the 22nd, the Japanese suddenly claimed that Ma Zhanshan was hiding in a small village called Lijintun, north of Qinggang. At six o'clock in the morning, the Japanese army dispatched six fighter planes from Changchun in formation to bomb the village, dropping eighty or ninety bombs, completely destroying the entire village. Afterwards, they announced that Ma had been killed in the bombing. However, according to reliable sources, Ma has already moved to Wangkui and will cut off the Japanese army's rear lines from the Suihua area. The Japanese claim is completely false. It is also reported that Ma is now reorganizing his troops into forty independent battalions, each with three hundred to five hundred men, adopting a guerrilla warfare strategy, with no fixed departure points and fixed assembly points, making it impossible for the Japanese army to cope. Even airplanes are ineffective. Recently, in the battles north of Hailun, Ma's army has adopted this method, which has been quite effective. On the 21st, Ma's army surrounded and annihilated a Japanese reconnaissance team of officers and men north of Suihua, so the Japanese army is very afraid of Ma's army. However, the Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters is therefore planning to transfer a cavalry division to assist in the battle. (June 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Meeting of Generals <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Chiang to Move Office to Luojia Mountain, Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou on the 28th and stayed at Yihe Village. On that day, apart from receiving He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, and Cao Haosen, he did not receive any other military and political officials. That evening, Chiang, accompanied by Cao Haosen, visited the General Headquarters and inquired about the office situation from personnel above the section chief level, encouraging them to work diligently. Late at night, he returned to the Yihe Village residence. Initially, Chiang, disliking the noise and bustle, planned to visit the new campus of Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain in Wuchang on the morning of the 29th, or establish a branch residence there to conduct office work. Upon hearing the news, the provincial government immediately rushed to make arrangements, and everything was ready that evening. A ferry was also prepared. However, at 9:00 a.m. on the 29th, Chiang visited the General Headquarters and began office work, reviewing documents and telegrams from various departments. The trip to Wuchang was temporarily canceled. At 9:30 a.m., He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, Xu Yuanquan, Wei Lihuang, Tian Zhongyao, Li Mo'an, He Jingwu, and Wang Shijie successively requested audience and were received one by one. Next, he received Huang Luchu, representative of Xu Yongchang, Huang Jun, representative of Tian Songyao, Cao Zhen, representative of Deng Xihou, and Hu Xiehuai, representative of He Jian. At noon, he returned to his residence and immediately summoned Wuhan Garrison Commander Ye Peng to inquire about the garrison situation and provide instructions. Since most of the generals were in Hankou, Chiang originally planned to convene a meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 29th, but it was not possible due to business. It was changed to 9:00 a.m. on the 30th at the General Headquarters. Officers above the brigade commander level were summoned to attend. The final decision was made regarding the military plans for suppressing bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and all generals were ordered not to come to Hankou unless summoned, and those in Hankou must return to their defenses within the day. It is reported that Chiang will temporarily reside in Luojia Mountain after the meeting, with a regiment from the 89th Division responsible for external defense and a battalion of Chiang's personal guards responsible for internal defense. It is also reported that He Chengjun has agreed with Chiang on the issue of military pay for the troops stationed in Hubei, and an additional 10% will be issued starting in July. Chiang has also agreed to bear the expenses for suppressing bandits from the central government, but the Sichuan troops stationed in Hubei will still be borne by the Hubei provincial government. In addition, the Hubei provincial government recently borrowed 800,000 yuan from various banks specifically for bandit suppression expenses, and the funds for repayment of principal and interest are now designated to be the income from the public bonds raised by the Qingxiang Association.

<p>Bandits Fleeing Southeast, Hankou Correspondence: This time, the Red bandits harassed the Pinghan Railway, and the tracks at Dongshuanghe, Liulin, Lijiazhai, Xindian, Jigongshan, Wushengguan, and Lujiashan were damaged. The damage to Lujiashan Station was particularly severe. The Red bandits numbered about ten thousand, mostly unarmed peasants. Starting on the night of June 27th, they engaged in fierce fighting with the troops of Ma Hongkui's 15th Route Army in the Lijiazhai area. On the 28th, they were still resisting stubbornly. On the 29th, the Appeasement Headquarters reported, based on Ma's telegram, that they had engaged in several hand-to-hand combats with the bandits who invaded the Dongshuanghe, Liulin, Lijiazhai, Xindian, and Jigongshan areas. Fortunately, our soldiers fought bravely, advancing one after another, and the bandits could not withstand the pressure and fled southeast across the board, and traffic has been restored. The Pinghan Railway Bureau also received a telegram from Guangshui Station stating that the troops of Wei Lihuang's 10th Division had arrived in Guangshui from Huayuan and, together with the southward troops of the 15th Route Army, were attacking the Red bandits from both sides. The remnants of the bandits were fleeing east, and all damaged tracks have been completely repaired. Therefore, the entire line can resume normal traffic. Today (29th), the special express train to the north departed from Dazhimen Station at 11:00 p.m., and the special express train to the south, which had been blocked in Xinyang, also arrived at Dazhimen Station at 6:00 p.m. today, both escorted by armored trains along the way. The train was blocked and stopped in Xinyang for a total of forty hours. All passengers are safe. After the entire line was opened, the Pinghan Railway Bureau specifically telegraphed the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces, the Appeasement Headquarters of Henan and Hubei, and the Ministry of Railways to report everything. After receiving the report, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters immediately dispatched eight aircraft from the 4th and 5th Aviation Teams to Wushengguan and the Xinyang and Bopi River areas in southern Henan to scout for bandit tracks. In the vicinity of Xinji and Wenshusi,</p>

They also observed fortifications built by the bandits on the mountains northeast of Huashanzhai and immediately returned to Hankou to report. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has ordered all troops to thoroughly suppress the bandits and eradicate their roots. At the same time, all troops were notified to return all vehicles detained on the railway to maintain railway operations. Anyone who dares to disobey will be severely punished according to the law.

<h3 id="e117">Wuhu Grain Station Embezzlement and Sale of Relief Grain Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Li Siyi Thrown into Jail</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor Initiates Prosecution</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In Anhui Province, there have been embezzlement cases in the accounts, previously in Bengbu in northern Anhui, and now in Wuhu in southern Anhui. The case in northern Anhui has not yet been fully used to punish the wicked, while Li Siyi, the director of the Wuhu Grain Station, has already been thrown into jail. Li successively embezzled 69 tons of relief grain, totaling 1,035 shi. He secretly sold 39 tons and 495 bags when the matter was about to end, obtaining only half the price, 1,140 yuan. When the matter was reported by the Shipping Association and various circles, Li was still very tough, relying on the strength of outsiders in the disaster relief working group. Later, as the court's summons became urgent, he voluntarily turned himself in to show that he was not afraid. Unexpectedly, the court had already investigated and confirmed the facts. As soon as Li arrived, he was not allowed bail and was detained. After repeated interrogations, the chief public prosecutor of the procuratorate, Sheng Shibi, initiated public prosecution against Li and the deputy director, Cheng Xiaoluo, and four others, each for violating Article 376, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The reasons for the crime in the indictment are excerpted as follows: "The defendant, Li Siyi, is the director of the Wuhu Grain Station of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, Cheng Xiaoluo is the deputy director, Wu Youzhang is the accountant, Huang Xiyong is in charge of accounts, and Wang Yixuan is the warehouse manager. The defendants have committed many irregularities in the distribution of relief goods. Since the station began issuing relief grain, the weighing has been based on 2,000 pounds per ton, with 12 liang per pound, totaling 15 shi per ton according to the Cao method of measurement, which is 1,500 jin. However, according to the instructions of the working group of the committee, each pound is calculated according to the British pound, with 12.6 qian per pound, so 2,000 pounds should total 1,500 jin according to the Sima method of measurement. The Sima method of measurement is 5 jin more per 100 jin than the Cao method of measurement. The station has issued all goods according to the Cao method of measurement, so 75 jin have been embezzled per ton. In addition, the relief grain received by the station was originally calculated in large tons, but when issued, it was ordered to be changed to small tons, with a difference of about 240 pounds per ton. Due to the change in tons, they colluded with each other to cheat, resulting in a considerable amount of excess grain. In these two types of irregularities, the grain they embezzled, accumulating small amounts into large, still amounted to more than 30 tons, stored in the public grain warehouse. On a certain day last month, Li Siyi, Cheng Xiaoluo, and others discussed selling the accumulated grain to others. Yu Songzhi, who runs a shipping business, was informed of the situation by Wang Yixuan and others, and they requested Yu Songzhi to sell it on their behalf, and also invited He Xisheng of the Hede Feng Shipping Company to unload the goods, using the name of Longtan relief grain, hiring ships to transport 39 tons and 495 bags of grain, plus two bags swept from the warehouse. Yu Songzhi then sought out Shao Liangfu, a rice merchant familiar to him, told him about the relief grain, and persuaded him to purchase it, agreeing on the amount of 39 tons, with a price of 1,140 yuan, calculated at 15 shi per ton, only 2 yuan per shi, more than half the market price. Shao, greedy for profit, purchased it all and privately completed the transaction with Yu Songzhi, handing over the money to Yu to be transferred to Huang Xiyong's home. At the same time, he transferred the grain to the Zhonghefeng Warehouse, with which he was familiar, and entrusted them to sell it on his behalf at 6 yuan per shi. While they were selling, the matter was heard by the Shipping Association, and Yang Xuewu and other representatives of the Sailing Department, together with the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, went to investigate and confirmed that the grain was indeed stored there and immediately sealed it up and reported it to the court. After repeated investigations by the court, the previous situation was confirmed to be true. Li Siyi, as the director of the grain station, had previously engaged in the common embezzlement of relief goods, and this time he was the person who took the initiative to sell the relief grain, so he deserved his punishment. Cheng Xiaoluo and others jointly engaged in fraud, swallowing the money while pretending to distribute relief grain, and they are all guilty." (June 28th)</p>

<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Provincial Relief Association received a report from Gong Pu, the county magistrate of Song County, stating that, according to a report from Li Yanchun, the district chief of the 5th district of the county, a sudden hailstorm occurred in Checun, Sunzhuang, and other places in the district on the afternoons of June 23rd, with hailstones as large as chicken eggs and as small as plums and apricots. The wheat was shattered, the autumn seedlings were broken, and the wind and water washed everything away, leaving nothing. After surviving the calamities, they had hoped for a good wheat harvest and celebrated their recovery. However, Heaven did not pity them and sent down this great disaster. How can the surviving people bear this? Therefore, we respectfully request that you transfer funds for relief to alleviate their suffering. Upon investigation, the report is confirmed to be true. It is appropriate to forward this request for a large amount of funds to provide universal relief to the disaster victims. This would be a great act of kindness. In addition, Zhang Sijiong, chairman of the Lushi County Relief Affairs Branch, reported that the county has suffered continuous disasters and famines, and the people are struggling to eat. Heaven did not show compassion and inflicted a severe hailstorm on the 19th of this month, lasting for about two hours, with hailstones as large as fists and as small as eggs, covering the ground to a depth of one chi. More than 300 villages were destroyed, more than 200 people were killed, and all the crops were destroyed. All the grass and trees were broken. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made calamities have left the county scarred, and now it has suffered this great disaster. We lament the fate of these people. How can they survive? Therefore, we earnestly request your association to quickly allocate emergency relief to alleviate the suffering of the people. This would be a great act of kindness. It is reported that after receiving the reports from the two counties, the association immediately sent a telegram appealing to the National Relief Association and various charitable organizations to quickly provide relief funds.</p>

<p>Nine-County Joint Defense Conference: The county magistrate of this county, by order of the provincial government, attended the joint defense conference of Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Chengxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, Xishan, Wuxi, and Yixing counties. Previously, due to the temporary suspension of the Shanghai war, it should now be continued. It is scheduled to be held from July 1st for two days at the Wuxian County government. After receiving the document, County Magistrate Shen has already gone to Wuxian to attend.</p>
<p>Banning Bamboo and Wood Rafts from Occupying Waterways: The county government has repeatedly received complaints from the people that bamboo and wood businesses arbitrarily occupy the city's waterways with bamboo and wood rafts, hindering transportation and hygiene, and often causing conflicts with passing boats due to obstructing the waterways. This matter was brought to the county administration conference, which ordered a joint meeting of the Public Security Bureau's 1st District Office and the Bamboo and Wood Trade Association to discuss the ban. The interim measures for banning bamboo and wood from occupying waterways, consisting of seven articles, have now been discussed and submitted to the county government for approval before implementation. The main idea of the ban is that bamboo and wood businesses must not arbitrarily place bamboo and wood materials in places where the waterways are narrow or overflowing, hindering water transportation. If more than one-third of the river surface is occupied, it is absolutely prohibited, and the Public Security Bureau should impose penalties according to the law.</p>

<p>Dispute over the Educational Construction Surtax: The land tax and surtax in this county have been sufficient to cover 1% of the land price in recent years. In addition, due to war and famine, the people's strength has been depleted. Therefore, the local administrative conference for this year decided that the surtax per mu for local expenses should still be limited to 2.6 jiao, as in the previous year. However, the 8 fen per mu surtax for education is a general case. Moreover, the provincial political conference decided that the educational expenses of this county should not be discounted from the 21st year onwards. Now, the authorities are still levying it at 7 fen and 4 li, which not only violates the provincial order, but also bankrupts the entire county's education cause. Therefore, Song Zijing, director of the Education Bureau, has submitted his resignation over this issue to show his determination. At the same time, Zhou Jiushu, director of the Construction Bureau, stated that the 5 fen per mu surtax had already been allocated by the Construction Department to the South Extension Project of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Provincial Highway, and the county government had been instructed to advance 40,000 yuan to the province before it was levied, which is a pressing matter. He has telegraphed the province for instructions on the difficult situation.</p>
<p>Fearing Punishment for Adultery with a Hired Maid, He Flees: Feng Yougen, a farmer from Fahuaqiao, previously hired a woman surnamed Gu from Tuolin as a maid to help with farming because he was busy with farm work. Yougen, although in his fifties, was still a ladies' man. Seeing that the woman was somewhat attractive, he tried every means to seduce her and had an affair with her. Unexpectedly, the affair was discovered this spring by Feng's wife, who immediately quit on the pretext of rest. At that time, the woman was already pregnant and angrily returned home. The day before yesterday, she invited her husband, Gu Afu, to negotiate with Feng Yougen at a tea garden of a certain family in the town. Yougen also knew that he had caused trouble and fled out of fear of punishment and has not returned to this day.

<p>Middle School Student Commits Suicide by Drowning: Qian Linxiong, a student at Suzhou High School in Sanyuanfang, 17 years old, from Wuxi, suddenly disappeared during class yesterday afternoon. Classmates suspected that he had asked for leave. However, in the evening, a classmate went to the repair room to draw water and suddenly found Qian's body in the well. After reporting to the Discipline Office, they tried to retrieve the body, but he was already dead. There were three suicide notes in his pocket, one to his family, one to his classmates, and one to a teacher. According to his suicide notes, the reason for the suicide seemed to be that he was not making progress in his studies and had no face to live any longer. However, according to his younger brother, his brother may not have been entirely due to his studies and must have had other mental anguish, which led him to take this drastic measure. The school authorities have notified his family in Wuxi to come to Suzhou to handle the matter.</p>

<p>The turmoil at National Central University (NCU) involving the rejection of President Duan and the government's dissolution of the university were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a summary of the causes of this turmoil, based on information gathered during investigations.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Motives for the Turmoil <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the university district system, the funding for NCU has been fundamentally shaken, and the anxiety of teachers and students throughout the university has been growing for some time. Last autumn, after the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government Joint Conference decided to suspend the allocation of funds to NCU at the request of primary and secondary school principals in Jiangsu Province, the students of the university repeatedly petitioned the government to secure the university's funding. This dragged on until now without any results. After the Shanghai-Songhu Battle, various sources of funding dried up, and most of the university's professors sought other employment to maintain their livelihoods. By April, faculty and staff were only receiving 30% of their salaries, which was hardly enough to live on given the high cost of living in the capital. This is why the faculty association repeatedly held meetings to discuss ways to secure salaries and even organized a one-day strike. The students, facing difficulties in raising funds after the Shanghai-Songhu Battle, requested that the university allow them to register and attend classes first, deferring the payment of fees, with professors acting as guarantors and repayments made in installments. Seeing the accumulating arrears in professors' salaries and the university's shrinking funds, the students naturally sympathized with the faculty. As a result, faculty and students jointly formed a Financial Independence Movement Committee, requesting the government to use the interest from the British Boxer Indemnity as the NCU fund. The government refused, citing that the Boxer Indemnity's use was stipulated in an exchange of notes and could not be changed. The students' demands were not met, and resentment grew. It was unavoidable that emotions would run high. Therefore, the motive for the turmoil at NCU was essentially financial. If the funding issue could be guaranteed, the problem of the president could be tolerated and resolved, and there would not have been the beating and rejection of Duan as acting president.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Appointment of Duan as Acting President <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Before a formal president was appointed at NCU, Liu Guanghua was acting president. Liu left the university a week ago due to unfavorable circumstances. Those who were opposed and left the university before him included Liu Yunchou, Dean of the College of Agriculture (when Liu left, the students of the College of Agriculture held a farewell party, and the professors advocated retaining him, resulting in a strike that has not yet been resolved), Yang Gongda, Dean of the College of Law, Fang Guangqi, Head of the Department of Physics, and others. After Liu left, Yi Qian took over his duties, but Liu's departure was not official, and Yi was acting without the actual authority to handle university affairs. In reality, it was difficult for Liu to return to the university, and the position of the president could not remain vacant for long. Therefore, Duan was appointed as acting president and came to the university.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Reasons for Student Rejection of Duan <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>When Zhu Jiahua took over as president of NCU, it was after a period of turmoil at the university. The government was deeply concerned about the complexity of the student body. After Zhu took office, he expelled several students to rectify the academic atmosphere and frequently rejected student requests, resulting in strained relations with the students. I recall that last autumn, when students requested the government to approve Zhu's resignation, a student representative told a reporter, "We believe that if President Zhu goes to the political arena to develop, his achievements will certainly be more significant than running NCU well." The implicit meaning was clear. During the faculty association's investigation of the accounting records due to the lack of salary payments, it was discovered that Zhu had misappropriated more than 30,000 yuan of disaster relief donations during his tenure to pay the salaries of faculty and staff who had left their positions with Zhu. This aroused public outrage. Therefore, at the general student meeting on the 27th, it was decided to send a letter to Zhu, demanding that he return the 30,000 yuan of disaster relief donations within three days and requesting the government to punish him. Yesterday, when the students heard the news that Duan Xipeng was acting president, they believed that Duan was Zhu's replacement and expressed their dissatisfaction. They decided to hold another general assembly the next day to discuss methods to reject Duan. At 8:00 AM on the 29th, while they were meeting in the gymnasium, someone saw Duan's Ministry of Education car parked downstairs in the president's office. They rushed to report to the assembly that Duan had arrived at the university. The assembly stormed out of the gymnasium and headed to the president's office to confront Duan. Sha Menghai, the secretary of the Ministry of Education who had come with Duan, had already taken the opportunity to escape. Duan, seeing that the students were yelling and about to hit him, raised his arms to grab the yellers. The other students took offense on their behalf and began to act, resulting in Duan being severely beaten. According to students who witnessed the incident, if Duan had retreated upon seeing the situation, the beating would not have occurred. Even after the beating started, if Duan had not grabbed people, he would not have been injured so severely. Therefore, after thoroughly investigating the reason for the students' rejection of Duan, it was simply to vent their anger at Zhu through Duan. Duan was confident that he had no ill will towards the students, so he did not think and went to the university abruptly, resulting in the misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Duan Xipeng's Report <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Here is Duan's report to the Executive Yuan and the injury report issued by doctor Weng Zhilong.</p>
<p>Report regarding the matter of submitting a report: I respectfully received the instructions from your esteemed Yuan to temporarily assume the position of President of National Central University and to go to the university to take office on the same day. Upon receiving this, I respectfully complied and went to the university at 8:30 this morning. After discussing the matter with Provost Cha Jiao for a moment in the president's office, the students of the university came from the gymnasium where they were holding a meeting, making a lot of noise. They barged into the president's office and forced me to go to the gymnasium to see them. I thought that the students of the university might not yet understand the government's painstaking efforts in appointing an acting president. I specifically asked to send a few representatives to meet with me first. But before I could finish speaking, a group of students forcibly dragged me downstairs, twisting, pulling, and beating me along the way, until they reached the outside of the South Gaoyuan Gate, where they kicked me to the ground, raining blows of fists and feet on me. My long gown was torn to shreds, and the car I rode in was also smashed. In the 45th meeting of your esteemed Yuan, it was resolved to appoint me as the acting president of National Central University. At that time, I had stated that National Central University is the highest institution of learning in the country, and we must carefully select a person of virtue and reputation and with educational experience as the president. I judged myself to be unworthy of this important task and repeatedly declined. Later, your esteemed Yuan stated that finding a candidate for president could not be done in a short time. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, various university affairs, such as hiring professors and handling admissions, urgently need someone to take charge to avoid delays. I was compelled to comply with the utmost intention of your esteemed Yuan to maintain National Central University, to fulfill my duties to the best of my ability, and to apply for a temporary appointment to avoid fault. Unexpectedly, this morning, upon my compliance with the order, a group of students acted with such violence. I was appointed without merit and I am filled with dread. I respectfully submit the situation of my being beaten at Central University today for your esteemed review and decision. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Zhu's Resignation Letter <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The original text of the resignation letter submitted by Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua to the Executive Yuan is recorded below: Regarding the matter of submitting a request to resign, Jiahua's virtue is thin and his ability is lacking, and his handling has been flawed, leading to the event this morning in which Duan, the acting vice-minister and acting president of National Central University, was besieged and injured by students. The acting president went to the university to take office this morning. Before he could speak, hundreds of students gathered at the president's office, shouting and hitting. The situation led to serious injuries, and the acting president has submitted a report on the injuries on record. In recent years, academic atmosphere has become unruly, and there are also malicious people fanning the flames, intending to disrupt the overall situation and shake the foundation of the country. This is like a fire spreading across the prairie, and it is difficult to control. Jiahua is aware of his shortcomings, and a broken cauldron is always ominous. Therefore, after clearly issuing the order in late December last year, he hesitated again and again and dared not take office. Later, the national crisis became more urgent, and it was morally impossible to decline. He reluctantly assumed the difficult task, hoping to serve for a few months, but failed to retire bravely, thus creating trouble. Continuing in this way will only add to the blame. Therefore, I hereby submit my resignation to avoid hindering the virtuous path, humbly requesting your immediate approval, so that I can fulfill my original intention, and I await your orders with utmost humility.</p>

<p>—Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu (pen name)</p>
<p>43. The whole village was in an uproar. Mr. Zhu called me out to see what was happening.</p>
<p>"Bandits are coming to loot, go and take a look." Little Erge said to me on the road. I squeezed through the crowd and saw a strange piece of paper pasted on the wall of the earth god temple. It was written:</p>
<p>"Commander Zhao Fei of the National Revolutionary Army's Thirteenth Division orders Zhang Huzi to send 5,000 yuan to Lake Muzhi today to reward the troops. We have not received pay for five months. If you have the heart to sit and watch us starve to death, then you are an inhumane miser. You are given three days to send the money, using a flashlight as a signal. If the deadline passes without the money, don't blame me for turning ruthless, so be it."</p>
<p>Can you guess what this note was pasted with? No one would easily guess. It was pasted with mud. Isn't that interesting? Zhang Huzi woke up from his dream in Yixia Cave. I saw him running around in a panic in the sunlight for the first time to ask for information. What could he do? His family property was almost eaten up. After running around for three days, he couldn't even raise 500 yuan, so he had to move his whole family to the city to hide. From then on, he never went back to the countryside. On the morning of the fourth day, another note was posted in front of the earth god temple, even more severe than the last one.</p>
<p>"Commander Zhao Fei of the National Revolutionary Army's Thirteenth Division again orders Zhang Huzi. You disobey the orders of this division commander, which is extremely hateful. You are again given three days to contribute 10,000 yuan. If you fail again, I will kill your entire family and friends, leaving no one alive, so be it."</p>
<p>For the past few days, every villager has been alarmed. There are more than twenty families with guns, but everyone is just protecting themselves, without any organization, just waiting for the bandits to come and disarm them. We have asked the security team a dozen times, but none of them are willing to come. The few of us in the ancient temple, however, are sleeping soundly. If the bandits come, we will invite them to drink two cups of clear water. If they want to eat coarse rice, we can also offer them a big pot. If they like rags and worn-out cotton, we can also give them away. Little Brother and I are still worried about being kidnapped. Mr. Zhu said, "It would be good to be kidnapped and try out bandit education." These are our plans during tea breaks.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, news came that a five-year-old child five miles away from the ancient temple had been killed by bandits after being kidnapped for ransom. The child's father was an old farmer who farmed his own land. After the bandits kidnapped him, they demanded 800 yuan. The old farmer mortgaged his land and sold his house to raise 400 yuan. The bandits took the silver and pointed to a small mound of earth, saying, "Do you want your child? He's in that mound."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu went to the city in anger. What did he go to do? Unfortunately, there was no time to ask before Old Xu spread rumors, saying, "Mr. Zhu is afraid of being kidnapped by bandits, so he ran away."</p>

<h3 id="e156">Careless Handling of Bombs Causes Tragedy <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Moved from Zhabei to the Arsenal</p>
<p>Shell Explodes, Killing Three and Injuring Two</p>
<p>When the Japanese army withdrew, they left behind many hand-pulled grenades, shells, and bombs in Zhabei, Wusongjiang Bay, and other places. After our side took over, we immediately issued a notice and tried to find and collect the bombs, concentrating them in the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau. Subsequently, personnel from the arsenal were dispatched to inspect them, load them, and store them in the arsenal's armory. Yesterday, before the arsenal had inspected them, the Zhabei Office hired movers' trucks to transport a large number of collected hand-pulled grenades, shells, bombs, etc., to the arsenal. When they arrived at the arsenal and were being moved into the warehouse, a worker was careless and dropped one, causing it to explode, killing two people and injuring three. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shell Explosion: Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau hired a large truck from the China Moving Company, with four moving workers on board. They loaded many hand-pulled grenades, bombs, shells, etc., inside. The loading was completed at about 2:00 PM, and then Deputy Officer Hong Shuren was dispatched to escort the truck, which entered the South City via Zhongshan Road. At 3:00 PM, they arrived at the No. 13 warehouse of the West Fort Armory of the arsenal and notified Zhang Zulian, the armory chief. At the same time, the moving workers, together with the old warehouse soldiers Gan Wanyou, Gao Defu, Chen Zhengxiang, etc., moved the items from the truck to the No. 13 warehouse for storage. After only a dozen or so items had been moved, the moving worker Gu Shan suddenly dropped a steel shell weighing about twenty pounds at the entrance of the warehouse. The detonator on the shell had not been removed, and upon impact, it immediately exploded.</p>
<p>Casualties: The worker and the escorting officer, Hong Shuren, were killed on the spot, their flesh and blood scattered, a truly tragic sight. The explosion also injured the armory soldiers Gan Wanyou, Gao Shangde, and Chen Zhengxiang who were also moving the items. Gao's legs were blown off, and Chen's head and one leg were also destroyed, resulting in extremely serious injuries. Only Gan's injuries were relatively minor. The time was 3:15 PM.</p>
<p>Sent to Hospital for Treatment: When the shell exploded, there was a lot of smoke. The arsenal, unable to immediately determine the truth, suspected it was due to carelessness and immediately telegraphed all the fire brigades. Upon hearing the news, the fire brigades from various districts immediately dispatched fire trucks to the West Fort. As there was no spreading fire, they immediately used the fire brigade's ambulances to send the injured warehouse soldiers Gan Wanyou, Gao Shangde, and Chen Zhengxiang to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment.</p>
<p>Brief History of the Casualties: Those killed on the spot yesterday were Hong Shuren, deputy officer of the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau, 25 years old, from Guangdong. He previously served as a deputy officer in the police regiment and as a special agent in the police brigade headquarters. When the Zhabei Office was established, he was transferred by Director Huang to serve in the office. Gu Shan, from Tongzhou, Jiangbei, in his twenties, was a moving worker at the China Moving Company. The seriously injured were Chen Zhengxiang and Gao Shangde, and the injured was Gan Wanyou. All three were from Jiangbei and had been serving as warehouse soldiers in the arsenal for more than ten years. They were extremely careful when handling munitions and had never had an accident. Yesterday, when the explosion occurred, their backs were close to the explosion site, resulting in serious injuries.</p>
<p>Dispatch of Personnel for Investigation: After the accident, the arsenal immediately telephoned the Zhabei Office and the Municipal Government. After receiving the call, the office immediately dispatched two service personnel, Huang He and Zhou Dexin, to the arsenal to investigate the truth of the accident. After arriving at the arsenal, Huang and Zhou met with the armory chief Zhang Zulian and also visited Director Song to ask for instructions regarding the matter. They returned at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Aftermath Issues: The bodies of Hong Shuren and Gu Shan, who were killed, are still placed opposite the No. 13 warehouse at the West Fort, covered with reed mats. The office will collect the bodies today. As for the injured Gan, Gao, and Chen, Gao and Chen are critically injured and their lives are in danger, so there is little hope. Yesterday, the general affairs department of the arsenal first issued each person ten yuan for transportation. If they die from their injuries, they will be treated as a case of death in the line of duty and given preferential compensation. The issue of compensation will be negotiated with the Municipal Government. Gao also died last night due to his serious injuries.</p>
<p>Armory Chief's Statement: According to Mr. Zhang Zulian, the armory chief of the arsenal, this incident was extremely unfortunate. After the takeover committee took over various places, the arsenal agreed with the Municipal Government that the Public Security Bureau would be responsible for (1) collecting and (2) storing all the munitions left in the withdrawn areas, and then the arsenal would be responsible for (1) inspecting and (2) transporting them to eliminate the danger. The bombs, etc., transported by the Zhabei Office today had not been inspected by the arsenal and were transported by workers hired by the moving company, who had no experience and were unaware of the danger, resulting in such a major accident due to carelessness. Furthermore, since the accident yesterday, the driver of the truck, because there were still munitions left to be moved, did not dare to drive the truck away, so the truck that transported the items last night is still parked at the accident site at the West Fort.</p>

<p>Hidden Reef at Huangshizui Causes Accident</p>
<p>Fortunately, All Crew Members Are Safe</p>
<p>Recently, merchant ships have been having accidents one after another, and even more ships have been having accidents on the Yangtze River due to the rapid rise of the river. Now, there is another incident of a British Yangtze River warship running aground and being damaged downstream of Chongqing. After a detailed investigation by our reporter, the report is as follows:</p>
<p>Wrong Navigation Channel: In recent years, the British Navy has increased the number of warships on the Yangtze River to protect merchant ships because of frequent bandit alarms on the Yangtze River and frequent attacks by communist bandits on merchant ships in various places upstream, especially those of British merchants. The gunboat HMS Peterel, which specializes in escorting ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, was sailing downstream from Chongqing. One day, when it was sailing 140 nautical miles downstream of Chongqing in an area called Ping'an River, it encountered rising water. The navigator mistook the channel, resulting in the major accident of running aground. The rivers in Sichuan have many hidden reefs, making navigation extremely difficult. Once they are submerged by rising water, it is even more difficult to see them. A little carelessness can lead to running aground.</p>
<p>Grounding and Impact: The HMS Peterel warship mistakenly sailed into the Huangshizui hidden reef in the Ping'an River area. The front of the ship rammed into the reef, and the bottom of the bow entered the reef. It was too late to reverse and pull out. The bottom of the bow had already been breached, and river water rushed in. In a short time, the water was eight feet deep. At that time, the ship was sailing downstream with the rapid current, making the speed even greater. When it reached Huangshizui, the bow of the ship crashed violently into the large reef in front, causing excessive vibration. After this collision, the head was damaged by as much as sixteen or seventeen feet, and the front of the bow was completely damaged.</p>
<p>Stranding and Rescue: After the accident, the captain sent a telegram for help. Fearing that the river water would flood the other compartments and sink the ship to the bottom of the river, he urgently drove the entire ship completely onto the shallow beach, stranding the entire ship to prevent it from sinking immediately. The captain then used cement and wooden boards to first patch the broken hole under the bow and then pumped out the water from the compartments to float the ship. At that time, he ordered a British gunboat in the upper reaches to tow the ship out of the shallows and bring it to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<p>Damage Report: It is reported that the bow of the British warship was destroyed and the ship was damaged in almost a quarter of its parts. Although the bottom of the ship was temporarily repaired, it must be rebuilt in the dry dock. The bow that was struck must also be rebuilt in Shanghai. The total loss from the warship running aground this time is at least sixty or seventy thousand yuan. It is currently being repaired and towed, and will soon be sent to Shanghai for major repairs at the shipyard. Fortunately, no crew members were injured, but the structures at the front of the bow were completely destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e158">No Definite Date for Japanese Troop Withdrawal from D District <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after repeated negotiations by our members of the Joint Commission, Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing, with the Japanese side regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from D District, there has been no definitive response. Committee member Yu Hongjun had no choice but to send a letter to Mr. Kennett, chairman of the Joint Commission, on the 28th of last month, urging the Japanese side to withdraw as soon as possible. However, as of last night, the Japanese side had not notified the Joint Commission and our side of a definite date for the withdrawal. The Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai sent personnel to visit Committee member Yu Hongjun a few days ago, stating that the Japanese troops in D District could withdraw in the shortest possible time, but there was still no definite date. Committee member Yu replied that our side had already submitted this matter to the Joint Commission for negotiation and asked them to discuss it with the Joint Commission.</p>

<p>Minimum Requirements for Resolving the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>Restoration of Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations to Be Handled by Mo</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, a local English-language evening newspaper reported that a senior official of the National Government, at the request of the League of Nations Investigating Committee, drafted a new plan for resolving the Liaoning case at the Guling Conference. Such a bizarre story naturally cannot be believed by us. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited Jiang Zuobin, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and ambassador to Japan, at his private residence yesterday to inquire about this matter. According to Jiang, this matter is absolutely untrue, and there is absolutely no such thing. As far as I (Jiang referring to himself) know, the Investigating Committee needs to solicit opinions from both the Chinese and Japanese governments to draft a report. Therefore, after arriving in Peiping, the committee inquired with our side about the minimum requirements for resolving the Northeast issue. Our side responded based on the principle of not hindering the integrity of China's territory and administrative power, and there was no so-called new plan. I dare say that no matter how foolish the people in the government are, they would not have proposed such an opinion. As for the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, when I was in Beijing, I heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had telegraphed Mo Dehui, the representative to Russia who was recuperating in Italy, to return to his post to handle the matter. He should have already returned to Russia now.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Rumors of the Death of a Russian Prisoner Turned Into a Missing Persons Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Brother of the Deceased Bases Report on Three Russians</p>
<p>But the Three Russians Deny Everything</p>
<p>French Police Prepare Coffin for Examination Today</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the case of the disappearance of the Russian Grantzki has been widely publicized in this city. After the Second Special District District Court announced the facts of the case a few days ago, the case has become clear. However, what is still unclear is whether the missing Russian Grantzki is the same person as George Radikiev. The court was unable to confirm whether they were the same person because the police report was written in Chinese. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency went to the Lujiawan Police Station yesterday to investigate. According to a senior police officer at the police station, the Russian George Radikiev who died of illness was actually Grantzki. The police station is currently investigating this error and is unwilling to make any comments before obtaining sufficient evidence. However, according to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency, the police have already summoned four Russians who are related to the case. Two of the four Russians were the ones who were sentenced to seven days of detention at the same time as George Radikiev, as reported yesterday. Another one was also one of those who were sentenced to detention. Another person was the brother of the deceased who reported the case. The reason for this is that the brother of the deceased had received reports from the aforementioned three Russians that before his death, they had witnessed the deceased being subjected to extrajudicial punishment in prison, bleeding from the chest, and then disappearing. The brother of the deceased then reported the case based on this information. However, when the police questioned the three Russians, all three of them completely denied making such a statement. As a result, the brother of the deceased was very embarrassed and declared to the police station that when the three of them made this report, two friends were present, so he asked the police station to summon these two people to testify. It is still difficult to know the final result of the police's investigation into this matter. However, the Second Special District District Court also released a new piece of evidence yesterday, stating that two days after the Russian George Radikiev died of illness, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi, accompanied by a Russian, went to request the release of the body. At that time, the inspection office, because the police report stated that the deceased had no family, wife, or occupation, and now someone claimed to be his brother, expressed suspicion and ordered that a written request be submitted before it could be approved. At that time, the reasons for requiring a written request were also explained. The Russian listened to the explanation and then left, but he has not submitted a written request to this day. Therefore, the rumors that have arisen may be related to the Russian or may have other background involved. Yesterday, the chief clerk of the Second Special District Court, Xiao, also told a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency that the court only knew of a Russian prisoner named George Radikiev and that there was absolutely no one named Grantzki. Even if the two were the same person, and the rumors about the cause of his death were indeed suspicious, the court's official pronouncements and examinations by the prosecutor Wu and the forensic doctor Wei were still in place and could serve as evidence. If outsiders still believe that this is not enough, then they can have the body of the prisoner exhumed and re-examined to quell the rumors from the outside world. The court authorities will now decide how to deal with the rumor-mongers according to the law after the police have completed their investigation. Yesterday, Deputy Inspector Pauldy of the Western Branch of the French General Police Department, accompanied by Chinese Detective Qin Youyu, went to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to notify them to hire a gasoline boat today with the branch's personnel to go to the Tangwan Cemetery to exhume the coffin of George Radikiev and bring it to Shanghai to be sent to the autopsy room of the Municipal Council Hospital on Thales Road for a doctor to open the coffin and re-examine the body.</p>
<h3 id="e161">삼문만 시찰기 (2) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>기업 회사들이 잇따라 투자하다</p>
<p>화교들은 원대한 계획을 세우려고 하다</p>
<p>삼문만의 현황: 태안함은 석포에서 3시간 항해하여 삼문만 내의 해유항에 도착했습니다. 겹겹이 쌓인 산과 푸른 파도는 잔잔하여 경치가 뛰어나고 독보적이라고 할 만합니다. 시찰단은 함선에서 내려 작은 배로 갈아타고 상륙했습니다. 당시에는 큰 비가 쏟아지고 길이 질척거렸습니다. 시찰단은 관부 지역을 일주하며 옷과 신발이 모두 젖었습니다. 길을 따라 밭이 가로세로로 뻗어 있어 끝이 보이지 않아 토지가 비옥하고 농작물이 풍성할 것으로 예상됩니다. 또한 순검사에 이르러 허정좌가 세운 부두와 삼문만 여관을 참관했습니다. 인근에는 보안대 1개 소대가 주둔하고 있고, 향민들은 편안하게 생업에 종사하고 있으니 진실로 도원선경입니다. 11시에 함선으로 돌아와 만내의 악정양으로 다시 출발하여 제방 축조 공사를 시찰했습니다. 오후 5시에 삼문만을 떠나 다시 석포로 돌아왔고, 시찰 임무는 여기서 끝났습니다. 태안함은 석포에서 태풍을 피하기 위해 하룻밤 정박했고, 27일 새벽 4시에 닻을 올려 보타로 유람을 갔습니다. 29일에는 용륜을 타고 상해로 돌아왔습니다. 삼문만 전체 면적은 매우 넓고, 만내의 항만은 복잡하게 나뉘어 있으며, 섬들이 흩어져 있습니다. 토질은 비옥하고 물산은 풍부하며, 수륙 교통 모두 편리합니다. 만 전체 주민은 총 7만 5천여 호이고, 인구는 약 37만 명입니다. 만약 개항 이후 상업이 번성하면 5백만 명 이상을 수용할 수 있을 것입니다. 주민들은 육지에서는 제염과 농업을 주로 하고, 해안에서는 어업과 상업을 생업으로 삼습니다. 만 전체는 어염이 주요 산출물입니다. 어업에 있어서는 춘추 양 계절의 수익이 약 80여만 원에 달할 수 있습니다. 과학적인 방법을 더하여 점차적으로 개선하면 그 수익을 10배로 늘릴 수 있을 것입니다. 소금은 항구를 따라 바닷물을 끓여 소금을 만드는 사람이 약 3천여 호이며, 계절마다 750만 섬을 수확합니다. 게다가 소금의 품질은 희고 깨끗하며 맛이 좋습니다. 다른 물산도 모두 갖추어져 있습니다. 식물로는 소나무, 삼나무, 대나무, 상수리나무, 잡목이 있고, 벼, 삼, 면화, 콩류, 보리, 밀, 땅콩, 담배, 차, 동유, 생칠, 쪽 등이 있습니다. 광물로는 은, 알루미늄, 철, 주석, 안티몬, 망간, 석탄, 자석, 청석, 형석 등이 있습니다. 만내의 기후는 온화하며, 여름에는 상해보다 10도 낮아 피서에 매우 적합합니다. 겨울에는 산으로 둘러싸여 있어 해풍이 들어오지 않아 오히려 상해보다 10도 높습니다. 여름에는 몹시 덥지 않고 겨울에는 눈이 쌓이지 않습니다. 만내의 수량은 깊이가 일정하지 않으며, 가장 깊은 곳은 사반양 일대인데, 깊이가 20여 길에 달합니다. 만 톤 이상의 윤선도 사반양 양안에 정박할 수 있습니다. 만구에는 어산이 있고, 위에는 등대가 있어 남양 민광 각 부에서 상해 천진으로 항행하는 표적이 됩니다. 이 산의 서쪽으로 북행하면 석포 정해 영파 등지로 통하고, 상해로 돌아갑니다. 만의 북쪽은 악정, 호진, 차원, 백교 등의 항구로, 만의 서쪽은 기문, 해유, 건도 등의 항구로, 모두 내륙 각지로 통하는 요충지입니다. 육로 교통은 해유항 관부 지역에서 서쪽으로 해유진까지 이르고, 이는 유천태로 가는 필수 경로입니다. 북쪽으로는 영해에 달하고, 봉화에 이르러 영파로 통합니다. 서쪽으로는 천태와 연결되고, 북쪽으로는 신창에 이르러 승현, 조아를 거쳐 소흥에 이릅니다. 전당강을 건너면 항주에 도착할 수 있습니다. 남쪽으로는 황암, 낙청에 이르러 온주로 통합니다. 서쪽으로는 동양, 의오에 이르러 항강 철도와 연결되어 완강으로 통할 수 있습니다. 최근 절강성 정부는 해유항 남안을 따라 삼의 장거리 자동차 도로를 건설하여 항강 철도와 연결할 계획인데, 그러면 하루 만에 항주에 도착할 수 있어 교통이 더욱 편리해질 것입니다. 삼문만의 형세, 물산, 교통을 보면 우리나라 해강의 유일한 요항이라고 할 만합니다. 정부와 국민이 합심하여 경영하여 성공한다면 대련 청도가 독점할 수 없을 뿐만 아니라 국가 경제와 국민 생활에도 막대한 도움이 될 것입니다.</p>
<p>개척 계획의 일면: 국민정부 및 절강성 정부 회감위원이 지정한 바에 따라 해유항을 삼문만의 중심 상항으로 삼고, 항구 남안을 따라 삼의 장거리 자동차 도로를 건설하여 항강 철도와 연결하고, 절강, 안휘, 강서 3성을 관통하고, 북쪽으로는 호진, 남쪽으로는 민월에 통하게 하여 수도 중추에 적합하게 한다. 보오에서 묘두산 일대를 상업 지역으로 획정하고, 순검사 오산 화서를 시정 중심으로 삼는다. 항구를 따라 윤선 부두를 건설하고, 시정부는 첨갱당에 설치하고, 공안국은 오산에 설치하고, 수경국은 소도산에 설치할 계획이다. 현재 보안대는 순검사에 주둔하고, 보호대는 화시가에 주둔하고 있다. 해유 일대의 토지는 모두 만 톤 이상의 윤선을 정박할 수 있는 부두를 건설할 수 있다. 묘두산 해안은 사탄이므로 해수욕장을 건설하기로 규정했다. 해유항의 북쪽 정서항의 남쪽은 주택 지역으로 획정하고, 정서항의 북쪽 기문항의 남쪽은 지세가 좁고 길어 조선소를 건설하는 데 가장 적합하다. 기문항의 북쪽은 호진항에 이르기까지 농간 지역 및 공장 지역으로 한다. 호진항의 동쪽 사반양의 동북쪽은 피서 지역 및 수륙 비행장으로 획정한다. 악정양의 서쪽 및 만어양의 북쪽은 모두 제염 지역으로 획정한다. 사반양 만산양 사이의 여러 작은 섬은 모두 어항으로 획정한다.</p>
<p>40인 협동조합: 해유항 남안의 상업 지역에는 이미 도남척식회사가 아름다운 숙지 수천 무를 매입했고, 신형회사는 이미 사반양 연안 가장 깊은 곳 일대의 토지를 매입하여 외양 거륜이 정박할 수 있는 부두를 축조할 계획이다. 최근에는 흥업회사도 대량의 지산을 매입하여 벽돌 공장, 정제 소금 공장, 정미소, 제재소 및 흥업 상업 지구 등을 건설할 계획이다. 영전회사는 연와산에 조림장을 건설할 계획이다. 이 외에도 개인과 남양 화교들도 이미 오산촌 남쪽 일대의 지방을 매입하여 주택을 건축하고 공장을 설립할 계획이다. 따라서 그곳의 수용지 가격은 1무당 100원 이상이고, 염전의 땅은 1무당 300원이다. 또한 상인 허정좌는 자금을 모아 삼문만 순검사 부근에 땅을 매입하여 부두를 축조하고, 창고를 설치하고, 여관을 건설하고, 상점을 열고, 익리 상륜을 창업하여 상해에서 삼문만으로 운행하여 교통을 편리하게 한다. 최근에는 서신부 주내식 등이 40인 협동조합을 발기하여 여러 사람의 지혜를 모으고 여러 사람이 들면 쉬워진다는 것을 실현하고자 한다. 그 방법은 각자 2,500원을 납입하여 40명이 합쳐 10만 원을 만들고, 이 10만 원의 기금으로 도남척식회사에서 숙지 1천 무를 매입하고, 상업 지구를 개척하기 전에 이 여러 해 동안 경작한 숙지를 오로지 과일과 채소 2가지 품목만 심는다. 들리는 바에 따르면 3, 5년 안에 원가를 회수할 수 있다고 한다. 그 방법은 매우 좋다. 만약 우리나라 사람들이 약간의 소단체를 모아 소수의 자본을 투입하여 생산이 풍부하고 이익이 막대한 사업을 한다면 삼문만의 발전은 눈 깜짝할 사이에 이루어질 것이다. 들리는 바에 따르면 40인 협동조합이 이미 설립되었고, 화교 건설위원회 방면에서도 원대한 계획을 세우려고 하고, 웅후한 자본을 조달하여 삼문만을 열심히 개발하려고 한다. 바라건대 정부 당국은 더 이상 공론만 일삼고 좋은 항구를 황폐하게 내버려두지 말고, 속히 재정적 준비를 하여 힘써 실행을 도모하고, 위아래가 합심하고, 여러 사람이 들면 쉬워진다면 삼문만의 개척은 상당한 연월 안에 성과를 거둘 수 있을 것이다.

<p>당정 기관 어제 대책 협의</p>
<p>오늘 오후 우선 소환 조사 예정</p>
<p>虹口구 怡昌 제사 공장 노동자 파업 이후 파업 노동자들이 각 공장으로 몰려가 일치된 행동을 강요한 결과 云成, 祥成, 通纬, 裕经, 新论, 厚福, 纬纶, 第七 제사 공장이 계속 파업에 들어갔고 统益, 仁记 제사 공장은 파급을 피하기 위해 자진 휴업에 들어갔다. 이에 虹口구 제사 공장은 완전 마비되었다. 시 공안국 5구 3분소는 보호를 위해 여전히 경찰을 증파하여 각 공장에 주둔시켜 경계를 강화했다. 전날 저녁 파업 노동자들은 임금 문제가 시 전체 제사 공장과 관련된 문제라고 여겨 수십 명을 모아 閘北구로 몰려가 작업을 저지하려 했으나 5구 3분 소장의 경찰이 권유했으나 효과가 없었다.</p>
<p>파업이 閘北으로 확산: 시 공안국 4구 경찰서는 보고를 받고 즉시 경찰을 증파하여 설득을 시도했다. 그러나 파업 노동자들은 이미 무리를 지어 閘北구 交通西路 丰泰, 慎记 등의 제사 공장으로 몰려갔다. 경찰이 극력 설득하고 경찰을 증파하여 보호했음에도 불구하고 여공들은 원래 겁이 많아 극도로 당황하여 질서가 혼란스러워 자진하여 물러나와 일할 마음이 없었다. 각 공장은 어쩔 수 없이 조기 퇴근시켜 기계 손상을 방지했다. 오후 5시가 되자 閘北구 久丰, 鼎记, 协记, 源和, 力昌泰 등도 잇따라 휴업에 들어갔다.</p>
<p>어제 아침 全停: 어제 아침부터 閘北구 전체 제사 공장, 예를 들어 潭子灣 丰余记 제사기 200대, 中与略久记 제사기 170대, 交通西路 丰泰慎记 제사기 416대, 沪大路 复昌 제사기 416대, 柳营路 和记 제사기 228대, 广肇路 源记 제사기 480대, 长安路 协记 제사기 208대, 梅园路 久丰鼎记 제사기 240대, 恒丰路 源和 제사기 480대, 鼎记 제사기 184대, 光复路 振兴 제사기 240대, 仁锡 제사기 274대, 长安路 瑞丰余福昌泰 (즉 同昌泰) 제사기 480대, 成泰 제사기 432대 등 총 15개 공장이 휴업했다.</p>
<p>당정 협의: 시 사회국은 제사 공장 노동자 파업이 지방 안정에 영향을 미치고 사전에 허가를 받지 않았으므로 확대를 막고 신속하게 해결하기 위해 직원을 파견하여 시 당부와 함께 진상을 조사했다. 현재 조사를 마쳤으므로 어제 오후 1시에 제3과 조정주임 王先青과 시 당부 민훈과 주임 汪曼云을 파견하여 대책을 협의하고 처리 단계를 결정했다.</p>
<p>소환 통지: 시 사회국은 어제 제4구 견사업 공회 및 제사 공장 업계 동업 공회에 통지했다. 통지 사항은 虹口 제사 공장 노동자 파업 건에 대해 본국이 7월 1일 오후 1시에 소환 조사를 실시할 예정이니 사전에 통지하여 귀회가 책임 대표 2명을 파견하여 본국에 와서 소환 조사를 받으십시오. 이에 통지합니다. 중화민국 21년 6월 30일, 국장 吴 亚.</p>
<p>공회 표시: 新声社 기자는 어제 제사 공회 공회 주석 沈 臣氏를 방문했다. 그는 제사 공장 노동자들이 임금을 요구하며 파업을 했다고 말했다. 본회는 신중을 기하기 위해 회원 대회를 개최하여 이 문제를 논의했으나 회원들의 의견은 이번 파업이 공회의 진정한 의사가 아니라 제3자가 배후에서 선동한 것이라고 생각했다. 제사 공장이 이 현상 유지에 勉强 开工 이유는 노동자의 생계를 유지하기 위한 것인데 노동자들이 이해하지 못하고 임금을 인상하려 한다. 쌍방이 서로 유지하기를 희망한다면 임금 인상은 사실상 만에 하나도 불가능하다. 당정 기관이 파업을 선동한 자를 조사하고 노동자에게 복귀를 권유하기를 바란다.</p>
<h3 id="e166">국약업 동업 공회 긴급 회원 총회 소집 <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>본월 5일 국약업 동업 공회는 어제 제2차 집행위원회 회의 결의에 따라 7월 5일에 긴급 회원 총회를 소집하여 공회가 제출한 4가지 요구에 대한 답변을 논의하고, 동시에 임기 만료 위원을 개선하기로 결정했다. 모든 총회 소집 통고는 이미 발송되었다. 또한 본회 다수 회원은 이번 파업을 매우 중시하여 동업 공회에 대처 방안을 제안하고 있다. 이에 본회는 최근 접수한 제안을 정리하여 회원 총회에 제출하여 통과 후 실행할 예정이다.</p>
<p>총회 통고: 통고 사항은 본업 공회가 최근 자본가가 조건을 파괴하고 외부 대체 노동자를 거부한다는 구실로 총회를 소집하여 파업을 선동하고, 연일 보도되는 바에 따르면 형세가 매우 심각하다. 본회는 동업자의 위탁을 받아 합법적인 대처와 경과를 처리했으니 명감하시기를 바란다. 이번에는 공회 측에서 지난달 28일에 대표를 파견하여 본회에 와서 구두로 4가지 요구를 제기했다. 상술한 구실 사항 외에 매달 1인당 급여 10원 인상 및 실업자 안치 2가지 요구가 있었다. 당시 본회 상무위원 张梅庵 동지가 중대한 문제이므로 집행위원회에 회부하여 논의한 후 답변하겠다고 답했다. 본 집행위원회는 이번 공회가 제기한 요구가 실질적으로 동업자의 이해관계에 매우 중대한 관계가 있다고 생각하여 동인들이 직권에 제한되어 함부로 모든 것을 결정할 수 없으므로 이번 달 5일 오후 1시에 본 회의실에서 긴급 회원 총회를 소집하여 공회의 요구 사항에 대한 답변을 논의하고, 동시에 규정에 따라 본회 임기 만료 위원을 개선하여 당정 기관에 보고하고 직원을 파견하여 지도하는 것 외에 각 회원에게 회람하여 출석하도록 통지한다. 동업자의 절신한 이해관계에 관한 일이니 각 회원이 정시에 출석해 주시기 바라며, 무한히 간절히 바랍니다. 이에 통지합니다.</p>
<p>회원 제안: 启者 이번 파업 건에 대해 견문이 미치는 바에 따라 약간의 초고를 작성하여 동업 당국 제공에게 참고 자료로 제공하고자 한다. (1) "대체 노동자 문제" 조사한 바에 따르면 이 안건은 본래 화의당 동업자가 공회와 조건이 정해지기 전에 서명한 선결 화약이다. 현재 이미 市社会局 본년 5월 14일 1911호 비령 및 中训部 등 정령이 있으므로 당연히 거절을 주장하고, 그 위법 행위를 확인해야 한다. 그러므로 공회가 계속 강요한다면 동업자는 끝까지 반항해야 하고, 어떠한 희생도 감수해야 한다. (2) "급여 인상 문제" 조사한 바에 따르면 본 문제는 공회가 강력하여 업주 점원에게 이기적인 이중 최면제를 씌우고, 무지한 군중을 유혹하는 전기 없는 원동력이다. 양관하하의 독랄한 수단을 운용하는 것은 조건을 파괴하는 명확한 예증이다. 대처 방법은 다음과 같다. (갑) 사실상 시황이 쇠퇴하고 영업이 부진하여 원래 지출도 유지하기 어렵다고 느끼므로 이번 예상치 못한 수요를 다시 부담하기는 어렵다. 즉, 분문을 증가해도 감당할 수 없다. (을) 인정을 베풀어 원래 급여에 따라 생활을 유지하는 데 충분하다. 옛날식 각 업종 상점과 비교해 보면 이미 우월함을 느낀다. 이번 무리한 수요는 사회의 공평한 평가에 맡기면 이미 불법이다. 나아가 인류의 욕망은 본래 끝이 없다. 이 불경기의 현상에서 자본가는 빚을 내서도 이 무궁한 골짜기를 메울 수 없다. (병) 법률상 강요 수요가 있어도 업주는 지급할 의무가 없다. 바꾸어 말하면 伙方은 요구할 권리가 없다. 법에 따라 단호하게 거절할 수 있다. (3) "안치 문제" 본 문제는 이미 한두 번이 아니다. 공회는 실업 공우를 이용하여 사회 질서 및 공공 안녕을 어지럽히는 것을 목적으로 한다. 그러므로 해결하는 방법도 당연히 법률에 근거해야 한다. (갑) 과거 사실에 근거하여 인용하고 힘껏 주장한다. (을) 법률상 안치 운운은 완전히 한 점포의 행정권을 파괴하는 것이다. 상점과 점伙의 관계는 민법 채편 제2장 제7절 고용 조문 내에서 시작된다. 만약 공회가 자유롭게 지배할 수 있다고 한다면 민법과 명백히 상충된다. 그 기세는 정부 기관이든 인민이든 영리 또는 자선을 목적으로 하는 조합이든 실업자가 있다면 모두 공회의 불법 세력을 빌려 자유롭게 모든 것을 지배할 수 있게 된다. 묻건대 정부는 여전히 정부가 되고 사회는 여전히 사회가 될 수 있는가? 법률의 장엄함은 어디에 있는가? 그러므로 이 불법 안치를 실현하려면 반드시 먼저 현재 적용되는 민법을 폐지해야 한다. 그러므로 본 동업자는 이 민법이 폐지되기 전에는 반드시 이 법에 근거하여 억지로 따르거나 모욕을 참고 완전함을 구해서는 안 된다. (병) 사실상 젊은이의 실업 공우는 대부분 열등 분자이다. 우승 열패, 달윈 진화론에서 자세히 말한다. 이는 자연의 이치이다. 만약 공회가 도리어 거꾸로 행하고 자유롭게 지배한다면 장래의 은환은 감당할 수 없을 것이다. 그러므로 죽음을 맹세하고 반대해야 한다. (정) 법률 부분에 관해서 만약 공회가 월궤 행동 및 불법 행위를 한다면 사법 기관에 소송하여 응당한 죄로 다스릴 수 있다. (4) "조건 문제" 민 16년 본업에서 정한 노자 조건은 그 계약 조문이 대부분 현행 법령과 저촉되므로 본회에서 조건 연구위원회를 조직하여 연구 결과를 준비하고 당국에서 쌍방 수정을 소집할 때 합법 자료를 제공하는 것이 가장 좋다. 조건을 법률과 저촉되는 것으로 약간 열거하면 다음과 같다. (갑) 조건 제1조는 노자 쟁의 중요 사항 처리 극준 조문 제4조와 위배된다. (을) 조건 제2조는 위와 동일한 제5조와 위배되고, 또 공회법 제20조 제3항과 상충된다. (병) 노측의 급여 인상 요구는 물가 지수를 근거로 해야 한다. (참조 위와 동일한 조문 제13조) (정) 내외마당 획분 문제는 상회 시행 세칙 제10조 및 제89 각 조를 참조할 수 있다. 그 제10조에 이르기를 "전 두 조에서 말하는 상업 사용인은 경영 동료 및 직접 영업소에서 노동하는 자에 한한다"라고 되어 있다. 이는 본업 쌍방이 서로 다투는 내외마당의 초점이 다툼이 없는 것이다.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Dr. Roger's Speech on Chinese Education Problems <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Roger, professor at Columbia University in the United States and a renowned new educationist, came to China in March to investigate education in various regions. His footprints spanned the north and south of China. He is now in Shanghai for a short stay before departing for Europe to attend the International New Education Conference. Mr. Li Shizeng and others from the World Society, recognizing that Dr. Roger's investigation of Chinese education would yield many insights and that he would undoubtedly have good suggestions for improvement, specially invited him to deliver a speech on "Chinese Education Problems" at the World College at 393 Fucaixin Road in the French Concession of this city at 11:00 AM on the 26th of last month. Over 400 people attended, including Cai Yuanpei and his wife, Li Shizeng, Gao Lu, Wang Jingqi, Yang Zhaoyun, Qi Zhi, Zhang Zhongdao, Zhang Junqi, Zhang Shijie, Wu Yunzhai, etc. They were first entertained with Chinese tea and snacks in a separate room. The meeting began at 11:00 AM, with an introductory speech by Mr. Li Shizeng, followed by Dr. Roger's speech, which is as follows: "I am extremely honored to meet with all of you today. The greatest problem in the world today is the pursuit of mutual understanding between nations. Without this, the world will inevitably experience great chaos and suffering. Consider that more than a decade has passed since the end of the European War, yet international chaos and suffering persist. This demonstrates that mutual understanding between nations is indeed a serious problem. We must recognize that international understanding and the construction of social education are of equal importance. During the European War, some people said that after this war, we would never see armed conflict again. However, the state of unrest in the world after the war is even worse than before the war. This was something that was not anticipated during the European War. Looking at the economies of the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, although they have fully developed, the number of unemployed people in America, according to recent statistics, has reached over ten million. The number of unemployed people in Europe is similar. The highest economic development has led to this result, which is largely due to international confrontation. Therefore, we must acknowledge that international understanding is now the most serious issue. To seek international understanding, we must first transform society. If we want to solve the transformation of society, we must first discuss the problem of education. My wife and I came to China for four months and visited various parts of the country. I feel that China needs to apply new education. Although I do not fully understand this problem, I believe that the education in Chinese schools is not suitable for the needs of society. This phenomenon is not unique to China; it is also the case in European and American countries. We should urgently think of ways to improve it. The upcoming International New Education Conference will be held in Europe, and we will try to solve this problem. I believe that the development of Chinese education is unreasonable because Chinese schools focus too much on academics, just like in Europe and America, and they also fail to meet the needs of local culture. There will be 2,000 people attending this New Education Conference, representing 50 countries. They are mostly entrusted by their own organizations to discuss the key points of new education policies. I believe that education must be adapted to the needs of the social environment and should be tailored to local conditions. Each place has its own special circumstances and cannot be generalized. I believe that there are several areas where Chinese education should be improved: (1) Urban education should be changed to rural education because the majority of Chinese people live in rural areas, while only a few live in cities. To ensure the rational development of Chinese education, we must pay attention to rural education. (2) Chinese education should pay attention to limiting population growth because China's population is excessive, and the supply of materials nationwide cannot satisfy everyone. If Chinese hygiene and medicine continue to improve, China's population will not only be 400 million but will increase to 600 million, 800 million, or even 1 billion. At that time, it will inevitably become an obstacle to construction and progress. Therefore, we should pay attention to limiting China's population. (3) Chinese education must promote the development of transportation. Although China has 400 million people, they are unfortunately fragmented and unable to unite, as if they are living in millions of villages without interacting with each other. In fact, due to inconvenient transportation, there is no connection in everything, and education is also fragmented. Therefore, we should first develop transportation and increase the public's opportunity to receive education. (4) The aim of Chinese education policy should not be to cultivate a small number of outstanding individuals but to raise the knowledge of the general public to the same level, both in rural and urban areas. At the same time, promote the education of industrialization and agriculture to support the development of the entire education. (5) Attention should be paid to health education. In implementing education in rural areas, we should make the general public pay attention to health, so that they can receive simple health education and apply it practically to help their health. The above are all the needs偏於 on material aspects. As for intellectual education, it is also important. The so-called need for knowledge is what method should be used to enable the general illiterate population to be literate and the general public to have basic common sense so that they can express their individual will. This is the success of education. We feel that the use of education must be in line with social conditions and put into practice. For example, in Ding County, Hebei, there are 118 university graduates who have nothing to do, forming a high-level parasitic figure. This is what I feel is dangerous. China should not only cultivate a small number of high-level talents but should improve the knowledge of the general public. I deeply hope that after the general public receives considerable education, they can all implement autonomy and self-defense so that they can stabilize the country internally and resist foreign aggression. Those engaged in education should bear this responsibility. What I have said is not fantasy, nor is it illusion; it is completely based on on-the-spot investigations in China. There are practical experiments in education in Ding County, Shandong, Nanjing, and Wuxi, and that is why I have this idea. It would be best to concentrate the experiences of improving education in various places, add a whole plan, promote it, and transform Chinese society. If we want to achieve the purpose of education reforming society, we must focus on training new education leaders because only with these leaders can we promote new education. This New Education Conference will also discuss how to cultivate new education leaders. I deeply hope that China can have these leaders to engage in the new education of transforming society. We must know that if we want to reform society, there is no way without education. To study the needs of the new society, we must find appropriate education methods and materials. Some schools in China today already have this experiment, which is very admirable. Finally, I hope that China's education will declare independence from Europe and the United States, and the leaders of new education should be cultivated in China based on China's needs. We should not send immature young people to study abroad because foreign educators do not know what China needs. If China needs foreign experts, it can invite them to China to give lectures or establish international higher education institutions. After completing their studies, they can go abroad for further research, which is not impossible. If immature young people go abroad to study, it is actually not very effective. This is what I hope the gentlemen in charge of China's education circle will pay attention to." His words were earnest and sincere, and they are enough to be the medicine for Chinese education. Then Mr. Li Shizeng gave a speech, briefly saying, "Mr. Roger's visit to Shanghai is very short, but today he gave us a very valuable speech, for which we are very grateful. At the same time, we are also very grateful to Mr. Zhu Maocheng for translating it. Now, please, the Datong Music Society will play ancient music, which is also a symbol of the convergence of Eastern and Western cultures." Then the entire Datong Music Society played ancient music, and the meeting did not end until about 1:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Establishment of the Municipal Government Security Team <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Two Regiments with a Total of 3,000 People</p>
<p>Under the Direct Command of the Mayor</p>
<p>Due to the receipt of the war zone, the Shanghai Municipal Government found that the original police force was insufficient for distribution. It had previously submitted a request to the Central Government to transfer 2,000 security team members from Beiping, Nanjing, and Jiangsu to Shanghai to strengthen its force. Now that the takeover matters have been largely completed, the transferred security teams, except for the 1,000 members from Beiping who remain in Shanghai, have all been transferred back to their original defenses. However, the area of this city is vast, and at this time of post-war revitalization, there is inevitably a risk of weak security. Mayor Wu, in view of this, personally went to Beijing to discuss with the Central Government the special circumstances of Shanghai and proposed to follow the example of the provincial governments to establish two municipal security team regiments with a total of 3,000 people to supplement the lack of power of the Public Security Bureau. Each regiment is divided into three battalions, each battalion is divided into three companies, and is equipped with machine gun companies, mounted patrols, automobile teams, armored vehicle teams, and communication teams. This was approved. It is currently being compiled and trained. It is heard that its duties are to assist the Public Security Bureau in maintaining local security. For the suppression of bandits, the arrest of thieves, and the suppression of organized unruly actions, it is responsible without infringing on the powers of the police. In order to avoid regional boundaries and facilitate the agility of mobilization, it is under the direct command of the mayor.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Two-Road Police Department Established Today <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Li Dingrong Appointed Deputy Director by the Two-Road Bureau</p>
<p>The Two-Road Police Department, which was established by the Railway Department's Railway Police Administration Bureau, is officially established today. The director is Ma Shaoping, and the deputy director is also appointed by the Two-Road Bureau as Li Dingrong. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Received Yesterday Before the establishment of the Police Department, all administrative matters of the Two-Road Police were handled by the staff of the Police Affairs Section of the Road Bureau under the orders of the Police Affairs Section. The establishment of the Two-Road Police Department this time is based on the reorganization of the Police Affairs Section. Yesterday, Fan Shaolian, director of the Police Affairs Section, did not go to the bureau to work. In the morning, Ma Shaoping, the newly appointed director of the Two-Road Police Department, went to the Police Affairs Section to take over and met with Chen Xinghan, director of the Two-Road Bureau, to discuss the organization of the Police Department and all matters related to the exercise of powers in the future.</p>
<p>Established Today After visiting Director Chen, Ma also met with Rong Yi and others, the directors of the police stations of the Two-Roads, to discuss the police affairs of the entire line. The department is scheduled to be established this morning. Ma did not hold an inauguration ceremony when he took office. The Two-Roads Bureau sent Li Dingrong, a former staff member of the Police Affairs Section, to serve as deputy director to assist in all matters. As for the internal staff, most of them are old people from the Police Affairs Section.</p>
<p>Internal Organization Although the department is subordinate to the Ministry of Railways and is directly commanded by the Railway Police Administration Bureau, it must also be directly commanded by the Two-Roads Bureau. However, nominally, it is an independent agency outside the Two-Roads Bureau. Internally, it is divided into four sections: judicial, administrative, general affairs, and police affairs. However, the police affairs section is combined with the police affairs section to facilitate handling affairs.</p>
<p>Minister Gu's Telegram Recently, due to the establishment of railway police stations by the Ministry of Railways on various roads, there have been rumors that the police must be reorganized separately. Yesterday, the staff of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus said that the establishment of the police station was only a reorganization of the original police affairs of the various railway administrations. Therefore, a special telegram was sent to the directors and deputy directors of the police departments of various roads. The telegram is recorded as follows: To the Directors of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus: It is found that the police affairs of various roads have always been under the jurisdiction of the General Affairs Office. Recently, the police affairs along the lines of various roads have been extremely heavy, and the General Affairs Office is the central organization for the collection of documents of the entire bureau. Fearing that it may not be able to take care of everything, the original police affairs department has been reorganized and a police station has been established so that it can take special responsibility and assist in rectification. All police affairs sections and road protection teams of various roads will continue to handle matters as before and have not been reorganized. However, according to recent reports, various rumors have spread outside regarding the reorganization of police affairs on various roads, such as the abolition of the general police section or the reorganization of the road protection team, causing the service personnel to be afraid, etc. It is found that the reported sections not only affect the progress of road affairs but also have a great impact on the security along the lines. They should be strictly prohibited in order to prevent the spread of rumors. In addition to sending separate telegrams, you should also follow the instructions of the director and instruct the police sections and teams under your jurisdiction to be informed and to perform their duties with peace of mind, without believing in rumors or playing with their duties, so as to avoid inconvenience. Minister Gu Mengyu</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Chinese Tram Workers Again Proposed Wage Increase Conditions Yesterday in the Drive to Expel Zhu <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Problem is Becoming More and More Complicated</p>
<p>The Situation is Becoming More and More Serious</p>
<p>The movement of workers of the Chinese Electric Company in this city to expel the car affairs director Zhu Shaoyi is becoming more and more fierce. Pro-Zhu workers were beaten and injured. The union put forward conditions yesterday, demanding a 50% wage increase, and submitted it to the municipal party headquarters for verification. The details of the various situations are as follows:</p>
<p>Proposed New Conditions On June 1, 20th year, the labor and capital sides of the Chinese Electric Company signed eleven articles of the treaty, stipulating that the validity period is three years, and it will not expire until May 30, 23rd year. However, the item on salary increase is another special agreement, and this agreement has now expired. Therefore, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union has already proposed new conditions and is negotiating with the capital side. It is heard that the salary increase standard in this new condition is to increase 50% uniformly according to the example of the same people's Lianyi Society.</p>
<p>Court Public Prosecution After Zhu Shaoyi filed a false accusation against Fu Zhongde and Lu Jiyun with the court, there was an interrogation once. Fu and Lu were released on bail of 1,000 yuan. It is now known that the court has filed a public prosecution for the case, and the defendant has also filed a plea.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Case of Tenants Suing for Rent Exemption in Tongchunfang <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Reopened Debate Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Sentenced on the 5th of This Month</p>
<p>The Tongchunfang houses on Beihai Road are the property of the Huamao Company and are rented by the British-owned Aierde Foreign Firm. Currently, the tenants are requesting the landlord to waive the rent for February and March due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War. However, Aierde believes that Tongchunfang is far away from the war zone at that time, so it is unwilling to accommodate the tenants' request and immediately filed a lawsuit for rent arrears. The case has been tried by the First Special District Local Court, but after waiting for the sentence, it was decided to reopen the debate because there were still investigations that were not completed. Yesterday morning, Li Hu, a judge, opened the court session again. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Zhongyin, presented a map to the court, proving the location of Tongchunfang. Then, he claimed that the area was a safe zone and was not affected by the war. The defendant should provide reasons for requesting rent reduction or exemption. Then, Le Junying, a lawyer representing eleven tenant households, argued that all rent for February and March should be exempted in fact. At that time, the Japanese army was invading the country, and planes and artillery were bombing day and night. In the Hongkou area, there were incidents of the Japanese army indiscriminately arresting citizens. The entire city was in a state of extreme unease. The City Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to suspend the market uniformly and jointly resist. At this time, the houses had reached a situation of "not holding it for one's own sake," and it was true that a part or all of it could not be used. Most of the defendants are stores, and since they cannot operate, they can request rent reduction or exemption according to the law. Moreover, the rent reduction committee in this city also has a resolution to reduce or exempt rent in order to regulate the financial recovery of the city after the war. Regarding this issue, the municipal government is still discussing it with landlords and tenants, which shows that it is not just the opinion of a few of the defendants. As for the rent after April claimed, it is found that the plaintiff has a kind of contract with the tenants, and lawsuits cannot be filed unless the rent is in arrears for three months, so it has not yet reached the time for repayment. The plaintiff's lawyer then continued to reply, saying that the market strike did not transfer the tenants, and the houses were still being held and used continuously. Moreover, not only was there use but also business income. According to the law, unless there is a fire, water, or other disaster, rent exemption cannot be requested. The measures for exempting house donations due to this incident stipulated by the Municipal Council do not reduce or exempt rent in the central and western districts, and the matter is the same, which can be used as a reference. The rent exemption committee is not a statutory agency, and the resolution is naturally invalid. The discussion of the municipal government is also a mediation nature and cannot forcibly exempt rent. All the owners in the central district are very concerned about this case and regard the judgment of this case as a touchstone. The defendant's lawyer also claimed that although the owners paid much attention to it, the tenants in this city paid more attention to the outcome of this case. After the debate between the two parties was over, Judge Li then scheduled the sentence to be pronounced at 8:00 AM on July 5.</p>

<p>Why Must the Thief Catcher Carry a Gun to Intimidate?</p>
<p>Yang Weiqi Died a Miserable Death</p>
<p>Yang Weiqi, a native of Chongming, 21 years old, lived at 64 Nanyang Lane, Seymour Road. He sold foreign vegetables in the Seymour Road vegetable market, and his life was quite comfortable. Yesterday afternoon, he went to Yudeci Bathhouse behind the Xian Shi Company with several friends to bathe. After a while, Liu Zhaonian, detective No. 73 of the Yangshupu Police Station, came with an informer and pointed out Yang Weiqi as a suspect in a theft case. Because Liu and others had many people, it was not easy to arrest them. He took out his pistol, aimed at his chest to intimidate him, but mistakenly touched the firing pin. With a bang, the bullet flew out and hit his big belly, cutting off a foot or so of his large intestine. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he was unconscious. The detective car sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was serious and his life was difficult to save. Because Yang was suspected of a theft case, the police station ordered detectives to take turns guarding him in the hospital. After the incident, according to the reporter's investigation, it turned out that the neighbor Lu Amao's house at 62 Nanyang Lane, Seymour Road, Yang's neighbor, was robbed last month, and silver ornaments and clothes estimated at several hundred yuan were snatched away. The case has not yet been solved. Later, it was discovered that Yang had a major suspicion in this case. Yesterday, he went with Detective Liu to his home to arrest him but failed to do so. He then found out that he was taking a bath in Yudeci, so he followed him to arrest him. According to Yang's friends, Lu Amao also worked in the vegetable business. Because of the jealousy of the same industry, he had always been at odds with Yang Weiqi. The robbery case this time was an outstanding slander, which was wronged and wrong. But in the long run, there will be a day when the truth comes out.</p>

<p>Her Paramour Committed the Murder in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>A murder case occurred at No. 13 Gaojia Lane, Jiesifeier Road, West Shanghai, at about 5:00 AM yesterday. The deceased was a woman named Tang He, who was stabbed in the neck and abdomen with a sharp knife by her paramour, Shen Qishan, and died. The murderer is 39 years old, a native of Hebei, and served as a soldier in the army. After retiring from the army, he made a living by setting up a meat stall. Last year, he became acquainted with the widow Tang He and lived together at 18 Hele Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei. He had a son named Shengde, who was 22 years old this year, and lived together. After the Sino-Japanese War broke out this spring, he moved to 13 Gaojia Lane, Jiesifeier Road with his son and went to work in a yarn factory to make a living. Shen still stayed in Zhabei until the day before yesterday, when Shen found the address of Tang He's residence and went to look for her again to renew their old relationship. Unexpectedly, the night passed easily, and a murder occurred in the room yesterday morning. It is heard that the two sides had an argument at that time, and Shen immediately stabbed He's neck and abdomen with a sharp knife. He shouted in extreme pain, waking his son Shengde from his sleep. At the same time, Shen Qishan also stabbed his abdomen twice. But one said that Shen's injuries were created by Shengde. Afterwards, the Kangjiaqiao Police Station of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau reported to the headquarters and sent the injured person to the Red Cross for treatment by car. The deceased Tang He, 49 years old this year, had his throat cut off and also had a serious injury to his waist. After the Public Security Bureau reported to the court, the court appointed Prosecutor Wu to inspect the scene and found that the deceased was indeed stabbed to death with a knife before his death.</p>

<p>Workers Allege Management Violated Settlement Agreement. The Shanghai West Da Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory previously experienced a labor dispute due to the dismissal of 108 workers. After repeated mediation by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, a three-article agreement was reached the day before yesterday, announcing a resolution. Yesterday, the factory posted a notice informing the dismissed workers to collect their severance pay. The workers believe that the third article of the agreement stated, "Those who wish to resign from the factory, the factory must provide a subsidy of eighty yuan," and does not contain the words "severance." Now, the factory refers to it as severance pay, fearing it is a violation of the agreement and has other implications. The workers are expressing dissatisfaction and unanimously refused to collect the pay. At the same time, the union will submit another request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for investigation.</p>

<p>Strict Prohibition by the Garrison Headquarters Against Impersonating Wounded Soldiers for Harassment.</p>
<p>Forbidden: Thugs and Ruffians Disturbing the Peace.</p>
<p>Protecting the Iron Will in Exchange for Reputation.</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a public notice yesterday, stating, "Regarding the wounded soldiers who have recovered and are staying in Shanghai, the headquarters and various military units have repeatedly sent personnel to escort them back to their units and have issued notices that they are not allowed to remain in Shanghai. Upon investigation, the wounded soldiers in this anti-Japanese war are all loyal and courageous comrades, and the people of all walks of life admire them. They should strictly abide by discipline to maintain the reputation of the military. However, recent reports indicate that some ruffians and thugs often impersonate wounded soldiers to harass various places, even gathering crowds to extort and destroy public property. We believe that our wounded soldiers have been in the military for many years and have undergone extensive training and would never do such things. We fear that there are one or two unscrupulous individuals, or ruffians and thugs, who are causing trouble under false pretenses, thereby ruining the reputation that the majority have earned with their iron will, which is extremely hateful. Therefore, we hereby issue a strict prohibition and severely prevent this from happening. If such incidents occur in the future, regardless of whether they are wounded soldiers or not, the headquarters will, for the sake of maintaining public order, severely punish them according to the law and will not tolerate them. In addition to dispatching patrols to investigate and apprehend them at any time, the Public Security Bureau is ordered to strictly crack down on them. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge."</p>

<p>Jiangxi Merchants Seek Assistance from Fellow Provincials in Shanghai. Regarding the imposition of goods production and sales taxes. The Jiangxi Provincial Government is implementing taxes on the production and sale of goods, with all imported, exported, locally produced, and locally sold goods being subject to taxation. The estimated annual tax revenue is over four million yuan, which is unbearable for merchants. Furthermore, under the current circumstances of post-disaster remnants and commercial depression, where would there be surplus resources to bear disguised double likin? Various trade associations have sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the authorities be urged to exempt them from implementation. Subsequently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of various trades, unanimously resolving to resist. Various trade associations organized a petition group and elected twenty-one representatives. Upon receiving the news, the provincial government secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to sit and watch over the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, preventing the meeting from taking place. A temporary postal and telegraph news censorship bureau was established, and all postal, telegraph, and news related to the production and sales taxes were withheld. The merchants and people of the entire province are under oppression and have no way to appeal. It is said that a large number of representatives are coming to Shanghai, intending to seek assistance from their fellow provincials in Shanghai before directly petitioning the central government, vowing to achieve the abolition of production and sales taxes similar to likin.</p>

<p>Zhu Qinglan's Report on Flood Relief (Continued)</p>
<p>A) Urgent Relief: Urgent relief offices were established, initially headed by myself, and later by Mr. Zha Junliang. Branch offices were established in each disaster area, with special relief commissioners. Relief bureaus were established in each disaster county, with relief directors and staff, to handle urgent relief matters. The meaning of urgent relief is to save lives in times of immediate danger. However, the implementation of this relief effort faced two major difficulties: (1) Relief from floods is not as easy to undertake as relief from droughts or other disasters. In the case of other disasters, except for those who have fled, the fields and lands still exist, and the land can be relied upon. Relief workers can push carts of food and distribute it along the way. However, after a flood, the land is a vast expanse of water. The disaster victims either flee to the hills and wilderness, or cling to the remaining broken sections of the dykes, or crouch on the roofs of collapsed houses, or climb to the tops of tall trees. The suffering of the disaster victims is extreme, and the difficulties faced by the relief workers are also extreme. Usually, the terrain of each area is unknown, and the landmarks have changed. Boats are sent out in all directions, but it is a vast expanse of water. It is easy to get lost. Sailing boats cannot move against the wind, and small boats often run aground. This is why the implementation of urgent relief is difficult, and it is deeply felt by the personnel involved. They are easily blamed by society for not being able to provide widespread relief. (2) The distribution of official relief is not comparable to charity, where philanthropists use their own money and save those in need. Charity trusts the distributors and pays little attention to complicated procedures, while official relief must go through appropriate procedures to ensure verification and demonstrate credibility. In the past, when there were occasional disasters, the government allocated funds for relief, which were mostly handled by the county magistrates through the director, often leading to many abuses. The military did not reach the people. This time, we wanted to correct this malpractice and ensure that all funds and goods were directly verified and distributed by relief personnel. Special regulations were established for verification and distribution, and they were required to follow them. Therefore, the process of creating registers, verifying households, and distributing relief could not be done in a hurry, nor could the procedures be confused and the distribution made vaguely. This is why the handling takes time, and it is easy to be blamed by society for the slow pace of relief. There are the above two major difficulties. If we only consider the government's single-handed relief efforts, only one in ten disaster victims would benefit. Fortunately, at the beginning of the major disaster, the local governments and charitable organizations all provided relief in different ways. More personnel meant wider benefits, and divided responsibilities meant more specialized handling. Thus, the first stage of difficulty was overcome. When the temporary work of all parties was completed, the long-term work of this group began. Then, the relief funds and goods were verified and distributed according to regulations for nine months, and the end has not yet been completely reached. Now, the main points of the method are listed as follows: (To be continued)</p>

As for the Jingji Company, we will forward your company's opinion to them. We hope you will consider our request."</p>

<p>Minutes of the Joint Meeting of the Ningbo Native Place Association</p>
<p>Solicitation to start August 1st</p>
<p>Resolved to Assist the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai convened a joint meeting of the Shanghai Siming Guildhall for the purpose of concluding the Hankou disaster relief efforts. Committee members Yuan Ludeng and Fang Jiaobo were present. Fang Jiaobo chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported on the severe Hankou flood last year, with many natives of Ning and Shao residing in Hankou. Therefore, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai and the Shanghai Siming Guildhall, along with the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association in Shanghai, formed a three-group body to organize the Hankou Disaster Relief Society to engage in relief work. Now that the work has been completed, it should be concluded. It was then resolved to donate the remaining funds to the Tanggong project. The association also convened its seventh executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM on the same afternoon. (A) Matters for discussion: 1) The Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association in Shanghai requested a joint claim for the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Two-Five Rent Reduction Method, with modifications. It was resolved to endorse the association's proposal and unanimously advocate for it. 2) Regarding the proposal to establish a permanent memorial for Director Chen Rongguan, it was resolved to join the Shi Gong Meiqing Memorial Association to make it permanent. The name of the memorial association will be reconsidered. 3) Report on the economic situation of this association (summary of income and expenditure report). It was resolved to hold a solicitation to make up for the deficit, scheduled to open on August 1st, and publicly invited Mr. Jin Tingsun to serve as the general captain, and Le Zhenjian, Xu Shengchan, Liu Hongsheng, and Zhang Jiguang to serve as the general staff. (B) Ad Hoc Motions: 1) Regarding the proposal for the Public Works Department to send personnel to solicit opinions from this association regarding the reconstruction of Hengde Lane, adjacent to this association, into a theater, it was resolved that the reconstruction of the theater at that location would cause heavy traffic, which would hinder transportation. In addition to publicly appointing Committee Member Le to inquire about the Public Works Department's letter of opinion, a written statement will also be made. It was also heard that the association's standing committee resolved to allocate 2,000 yuan to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army, to be submitted for retroactive recognition when the special committee meets in the future.</p>

<p>Two Important Letters from the Association for the Promotion of National Products.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products stated that the products of its members were mistakenly identified as enemy goods by the former Anti-Japanese Association, and a considerable number were detained. Chairman Chen Yiting, standing committee members Chen Binghui, Shen Shuyu, Xu Jianruo, Fang Jiange, and others repeatedly provided legal proof to rescue and return the goods. Later, the association was suspended for several months, and the mistakenly detained goods of various factories suffered irreparable damage. Now, it is learned that the Investigation Committee for Detained Goods of the former Anti-Japanese Association has been established and is starting the investigation. In order to protect the interests of members and rescue factories after the war, a special request was submitted to the municipal government yesterday to expedite the return of the goods, and all factories were notified to register within the deadline. The drafts are as follows: (1) A petition to the municipal government stated: "A petition regarding the products of national goods factories and raw materials for manufacturing national goods that were mistakenly detained by the former Anti-Japanese Association, requesting the protection of national goods, understanding of the difficulties of merchants, and a quick instruction to the Investigation Committee to expedite the return of the goods in order to facilitate sales and expand manufacturing. The factories that are members have successively sent letters stating that the products of members and raw materials for manufacturing national goods were mistakenly identified as enemy goods by the former Anti-Japanese Association and have been detained for several months without any definite news of return. Now, it is learned that the Investigation Committee has been established and is starting the investigation. Please take measures to rescue them to avoid damage and maintain national goods, etc. Upon investigation, the former Anti-Japanese Association mistakenly detained a considerable number of products of national goods factories. The delay of several months has caused irreparable losses. At this time of serious national crisis, it is a good opportunity to promote national goods. Moreover, national goods factories have suffered damage from the war and have been greatly weakened, which cannot be restored in a short period of time. The timely establishment of the Investigation Committee deeply admires your understanding of the difficulties of merchants and your intention to protect national goods. This association's responsibility is to promote national goods and protect its members, and it cannot remain silent. It is appropriate to submit a petition requesting that you quickly instruct the Investigation Committee to expedite the return of all mistakenly detained products of national goods factories in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and maintain national goods. The national salvation movement is deeply reliant on this." (2) A notice to all factories stated: "Regarding an important notice: Upon investigation, the former Anti-Japanese Association often mistakenly identified the products of national goods factories as enemy goods and detained them, resulting in great losses and unresolvable grievances. Now, it is learned that the Investigation Committee for Detained Goods of the former Anti-Japanese Association has been declared established and is starting registration. We urge all factories to quickly register the detained goods at 38 Fenglinqiao Road from July 1st to 10th. In order to protect the interests of members and reduce their suffering, in addition to submitting a petition to the municipal government instructing the committee to expedite the return of the mistakenly detained goods of the factories that are members of this association, based on the principle of rescuing post-war losses and assisting the economy of factories, we also plan to collect the detained goods of all members and request them together in order to facilitate their return in the shortest possible time and maintain the interests of members. Therefore, we specifically notify all factories that, when registering, they should send a copy of the detained goods to the association within one week for verification. This matter is important, please do not delay or harm your own rights."</p>

<p>Bandits Secretly Conspire in Hotel.</p>
<p>Detectives Arrest Eight Robbers.</p>
<p>Guns and Bullets Confiscated.</p>
<p>Yin Zhanqing, a Chinese detective at the General Investigation Department of the General Police Department, discovered that bandits were entrenched in room 30 of the Kader Hotel on Kader Road, secretly conspiring and plotting wrongdoing. Therefore, the previous afternoon, he reported to the Chinese Chief Detective Lu Liankui, who personally supervised detectives Liu Shaokui, Bao Liansheng, Wang Chengying, and western detective Yaman to secretly go and arrest the bandits Zhu Yuwen and Ren Agen. A pistol and seven bullets were confiscated from Zhu. Not long after, six more bandits, Qu Hongsheng, Chen Jinmao, Huang Wu, Ding Zhaoqian, Wang Jinfang, and Wang Haihai, walked into the room. Upon seeing the detectives, Chen immediately threw a pistol with nine bullets inside onto the bed, which was confiscated. Chen and others were arrested, and two more bullets were confiscated. In total, eight bandits were arrested, and two pistols and eighteen bullets were confiscated. They were all taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation, saying that the police had not yet clarified the case, so they had not filed a lawsuit, and requested permission to detain them. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the case, questioned the defendants, and ordered that they be detained.</p>

<p>Skeleton Found in Grass Bag Dredged from Pujiang.</p>
<p>Impossible to Distinguish Gender.</p>
<p>Presumably Killed by Japanese Soldiers.</p>
<p>The Hai Xie dredging barge of the Dredging Bureau was dredging mud on the Pujiang River at the Huangpu Wharf in East Shanghai. In the evening, the mud was transported back to the Suzhou River estuary to dump the mud and repair the dam. Suddenly, the mud boat foreman Gao Guifa discovered a grass bag in the mud. Upon opening it, in addition to many bricks and stones, there was also a skeleton. It was impossible to identify the gender. It was then discovered that the grass bag seemed to be a Japanese salted fish bag, but it had turned black. It had probably been submerged at the bottom of the river for several months. The incident was reported to the Customs Water Police Station, which ordered detective Deng Jiagen to investigate. Seeing that the skeleton had no flesh and skin, it was difficult to identify the person. It was taken up, but no one claimed it. Therefore, he ordered the workers to fill it back into the mud dam. It is speculated that it was the body of a Chinese person killed by Japanese soldiers during the Shanghai war and was sunk in the river to destroy the traces.</p>

<p>Chen Longsheng Murder Case.</p>
<p>Debate Concluded, Awaiting Verdict.</p>
<p>The Yong woman Qi Wu, 42 years old, residing at 88 Xin Kang Li, Tao Wei Road, asked her lodger Chen Longsheng, a Nanking native, for a debt of thirty-nine yuan around 8 p.m. on the 19th of this month. Chen only paid back two yuan, which caused an argument. Chen flew into a rage and took out a small knife from his sleeve, stabbing Wu in the neck nine times, and also stabbing her husband Qi Daxing in the neck. Chen, seeing the great disaster he had caused, fled out the door. Wu was sent to Tongren Hospital, where she died from her injuries. The Yulin Road police, led by detective Gui Shou, arrested Chen at the Xiaoshijie Amusement Park in the city. It was learned that the murder weapon was hidden under the incense burner inside the house at 333 Wuzhou Road, so a secret search was conducted but nothing was found. Later, Chen was captured in the drainage ditch of the patio and brought to the First Special Court. Chen confessed that he had been having an affair with Wu for many years, but because she had started a relationship with someone else, he acted out of anger, etc. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that it was confirmed during the adjournment that the murder weapon belonged to the defendant and that it was intentional homicide, requesting severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. Judge Qiao Wanxuan reviewed the confession and ordered that he remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<p>Ignoring Extortion Leads to Robbery.</p>
<p>Victim Catches One Thief.</p>
<p>Li Dingyi, a resident of 155 Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, has been receiving extortion letters for the past few days, which Li ignored. However, at 10:30 p.m. last night, seven robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, suddenly arrived, brandishing pistols, and prohibiting any outcry. They searched and robbed for about half an hour before fleeing with their loot. The tenant Xie Xin lost 18 yuan in cash and a pair of gold earrings. Li lost more than 50 yuan in cash and more than 300 jiao in small change, along with clothing and other items, totaling about 400 yuan. The robbers fled in different directions upon leaving the house. Li secretly followed in close pursuit and caught one thief after chasing him to Paotai Road, Zhouzhao Road. The sentry post there brought the thief and the victim to the Second District Headquarters, awaiting transfer to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Cai-made Anti-Smoking Solution Is Not an Opium Substitute <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Cui Daosheng Acquitted</p>
<p>Zheng Ziqian Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>On May 13th, Song Bing, Zhang Shaoqing, Ding Zhigao, and other Chinese detectives from the Narcotics Division of the General Inspectorate, having learned that the "Flying Thunder Gaoliang Cai Freedom Anti-Smoking Peace Solution" sold by the Lei Yu Pharmaceutical Company at No. 22 Sanhe Lane, Jiangxi Road, contained toxic substances, went to arrest Cantonese natives Cui Daosheng and Zheng Ziqian. A considerable amount of the solution was seized. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court. The two defendants were ordered to post bail of 1,500 yuan each, pending a new assessment by the court's forensic doctor. This matter was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the hearing in the First Criminal Division. The defendants were represented by lawyer E Sen. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, stated that the police were prosecuting the case under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, for selling opium substitutes and privately possessing smoking paraphernalia. However, the case seemed to be a scientific issue, dependent entirely on the result of the assessment. If the assessment showed that the solution did not exceed the fixed composition, then it would naturally not be an opium substitute. He inquired whether the court had received the assessment report. Judge Fu then released the forensic doctor's assessment report to both lawyers for review and declared that according to the court's forensic report, the assessment of the solution indicated that it was not an opium substitute but rather a type of nicotine solution. He then ordered the commencement of arguments. After arguments between the police lawyer Ru Bao and the defendant's lawyer E Sen, Judge Fu acquitted Cui Daosheng in court. Zheng Ziqian was found not guilty of selling opium substitutes, but guilty of possessing opium smoking paraphernalia for criminal purposes, and was fined 300 yuan. If he failed to pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every three yuan. One opium pipe and one opium lamp were confiscated. As for the seized anti-smoking solution, it should be returned to the defendant upon application.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Mr. Chairman,</p>
<p>Yesterday, your newspaper's local news column, under the heading "Record of the General Meeting of the Silk Mill Association," stated, "The strike in various silk mills in Hongkou, demanding improved treatment in all departments, is not the true intention of the union and was caused by incitement from third parties. The truth is not only understood by the industry, but also by various party and government agencies and the trade union." This is far from the truth. The strike was actually caused by employers cutting wages and destroying benefits, causing workers to suffer and making them unable to endure it, thus leading to the strike. If the employers had not cut wages and oppressed the workers, how could a third party incite them to any effect? Furthermore, the same item stated, "The workers in various factories have held several meetings and are very surprised that the demands to restore the original treatment are being published in the newspaper in the name of the colleagues. The workers are deeply aware of the employer's difficulties and are now resuming work to maintain the workers' livelihoods. The resumption of work was agreed upon by both labor and management. In this labor dispute, there are obviously others stirring up trouble. The workers have no demands whatsoever and have already appointed representatives Ji Xiangcheng, Shen Shaoqin, etc., who have signed their names and issued a factual statement in the newspaper, resolving that wages cannot be increased any further and maintaining the status quo." This statement is even more difficult to reconcile with the facts. The workers' demand for improved treatment is a universal expectation. Moreover, the silk mill workers are subjected to the oppressive and harsh treatment of employers, and they suffer terribly. How can they not want to improve their situation? The said Mr. Shen and others obviously have ulterior motives and do not represent the true intentions of all the workers. Fearing that this will confuse the public, we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, the Shanghai Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, June 30th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Mr. Editor of Shen Bao,</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>In 1872, there was a Cantonese Taiping Rebellion veteran named Rong Hong who surprisingly understood English. He took a group of students to study in the United States. This group of thirty students can be considered the first batch of Chinese students to study abroad. After arriving in the United States, Rong Hong married an American woman. This American woman was a second-marriage woman, so she brought her son from her previous marriage, a "stepson." Later, Rong Hong quarreled with the American woman and separated, dying in the United States. Rong Hong had a very good reputation in the United States because he spoke English very beautifully, so Americans even called him an orator.</p>
<p>From Rong Hong, I am reminded of the first batch of students to study abroad, and from the first batch of students to study abroad, I am reminded of Liang Zhengdong and Tang Shaochuan. Tang Shaochuan and Liang Zhengdong were among the thirty students in this first batch of students to study abroad. After Tang and Liang returned, Li Hongzhang ordered them to enter the Naval Academy to study Chinese. The first batch of students to study abroad were all very young. At that time, the purpose of studying abroad was to learn foreign languages, so it was necessary to send young students abroad, so that it would be easier to read foreign books.</p>
<p>After Tang Shaochuan and Liang Zhengdong graduated from the Naval Academy, I went to Korea and brought them with me to work as foreign language clerks in the Korean customs.</p>

He described the details of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War to me in great detail. Because I believed his words were all personal experiences, I supplemented the following records of matters not found in the newspapers. The Songhu War lasted for a little over a month. The Japanese army's commander had already changed four times. Among them, the momentum was strongest when Ueda came to Shanghai. He commanded about 60,000 troops, equipped by both land and sea. All the latest scientific weapons were available. Coupled with the arrogance of the ultimatum, he had the intention of settling the matter in one battle. At that time, our army had few soldiers and inferior weapons, and the defensive line was meandering for more than forty miles. They were attacked from both sides, and it was almost impossible for the entire army to avoid annihilation. I still remember a certain battle at Miaohang. The defenders of our army's position were only about 500 people, while the enemy came with about three times as many troops, taking advantage of the situation to surround them. The situation was precarious. Fortunately, a certain company of soldiers suddenly came up with a brilliant plan and secretly climbed more than ten elm trees not far from the position with machine guns. They waited for the enemy to sweep and fire. The victims were defeated. However, no one understood where the bullets came from. This is very similar to the divine skill of a certain soldier in Zhabei crouching on the roof of a civilian house and shooting down an airplane with a rifle. One day, when the Japanese planes were dropping bombs on the Zhabei position, each bomb weighed about ten pounds and fell like snowflakes. At this time, our soldiers bravely disregarded their safety, raised their heads, and forced to grab the bombs. Although the bombs fortunately did not explode, the enemy planes were afraid of being shot and flew away. Alas. Our army's resistance to the enemy was so brave and heroic, but in the end, they failed to drive the invaders out of the country. Although it can be said to be the will of Heaven, is it not also a matter of human affairs?</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Reason for Wang Xiaolai's Grief <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The other day, during the memorial service for the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration who died in the national crisis, held at the North Railway Station, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai's speech was short and rushed, containing endless grief. It was different from his behavior at other memorial services. The next day, Choucheng met with him and asked why he was not as grief-stricken when mourning the fallen soldiers. Why did he almost weep yesterday? He said that when he arrived at the meeting, he saw that the railway station building had been almost completely destroyed by the Japanese army's bombing. Rubble was everywhere, and dangerous walls towered high, which had already greatly stimulated him. When Wang Chunbo read the eulogy, imitating the ancient custom of Shaoxing, with rising and falling tones, as if weeping and complaining, it touched his hometown sentiments. When he heard the families of the deceased employees crying loudly, he couldn't help but feel grief coming from within, almost to the point of tears. Then, he saw among the families of the deceased, white-haired old women with hunched figures, young women with sorrowful eyebrows, and innocent young children who did not understand the world, all wearing black gauze on their arms and huddled in a corner. The widowers, widows, orphans, and destitute were all present before his eyes. Who can be without emotion? How could he not be saddened? According to my original intention, I should have given each person a hundred Yuan coins with Yuan Shikai's image to express my heart. Unfortunately, my current economic ability is not as generous as it was in previous years. My heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient. What can I do? The Japanese soldiers are invading our territory. Those who wear the tiger talisman have the responsibility to defend the territory, but they embrace the policy of non-resistance and allow them to drive straight in and lose important places without hearing of any punishment. Those railway employees, who have no responsibility to defend the territory, were able to embrace the determination to die and, under the enemy's dense aircraft bombs, faithfully and diligently maintain transportation and supply the rear military. They did not care if their heads were broken, their arms were broken, their bones were crushed, or their chests were pierced. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are even greater than the brave generals on the front lines. How can we not respect them?</p>

<p>— Haike</p>
<p>The Japanese are obsessed with kissing films. Although the Japanese nationwide is extremely licentious, they pretend to be upright and dignified on the surface. They appear to be a moral nation of more than three generations. Therefore, they also believe that kissing between men and women is extremely immoral. All European and American films that are imported into their country must undergo strict inspection, and all kissing parts must be completely cut off. English writer J. Street's book "Mysterious Japan" once described this matter. It is said that the work of cutting out kissing scenes in films is hosted by an American hired by the Japanese. He felt sorry for all the beautiful scenes of mouth-to-mouth contact being cut off. Therefore, he specially connected countless cut-off kissing fragments to form a large reel of kissing films. One mouth after another, one lip after another, connected in various ways. He sometimes privately screened them at home for his friends to watch. Everyone said it was a grand spectacle.</p>
<h3 id="e227">A Beautiful Tale of Goldfish <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Returning from the Goldfish Garden in West Shanghai, I brought back many stories and news about goldfish. Having nothing to do, let me talk about these gleanings.</p>
<p>Goldfish from America. Isn't the journey to America very far? It is quite troublesome to bring them back and forth, unless it is by postal ship. But Americans have great faith in Chinese famous fish. The ship's stewards put their minds to bringing them back. Do you know how they bring them? They used large wooden buckets in Tianjin or Shanghai to scoop up the original water from the fish tanks. Then they put all kinds of fish in them. Isn't the weather hot and cold? They are very careful to keep the temperature of the cabin where the fish buckets are placed consistent. They use air conditioning or ice in hot weather and heaters or radiators in cold weather. In short, they have to keep the temperature consistent so that they can safely arrive in San Francisco and New York. What about eating? There are dried water fleas for sale in Tianjin. It is said that they cost 1.6 yuan per pound. So when they are transported to America, the goldfish will still not be thin and starved to death. That kind of fish-carrying business is also a good business for the ship's stewards.</p>
<p>Xu Guoliang's goldfish. That old fisherman used to raise fish for a living in Beiping. He was brought by the late Shanghai Police Commissioner Xu Guoliang. After the old man arrived in Shanghai, he served General Xu with dozens of tanks of fine species. Later, General Xu was killed, and the attendants dispersed. These many fish were bought by the late Mr. Huang Chujiu and placed in the Great World for care. Later, they were gradually sold out. The large batch was bought by Mr. Mu, who was once a Vice Minister. Mr. Mu was still in Shanghai at the time and cherished those fish like treasures. Soon, he was honored with a position of power. He still begrudged the shipping costs and moved the most beloved tanks to the capital. It is said that there are still many in both Beijing and Shanghai. The old fisherman told me endlessly. When I have time, I will write it down again.</p>

<p>— Xueni</p>
<p>In times of chaos and separation, there are always many extraordinary people. In history, such as during the Han and Wei dynasties, the Song and Yuan dynasties, and the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were many outstanding, upright, and talented people who were known for their art or established for their character. Such as Ji Kang, Ruan Ji, Wei Zheng, Huang Daozhou, Gu Yanwu, Zhu Da and other peers, can be counted. My friend Chen Zixiao, style name Die, is also an extraordinary person of today. Yu Fan wrote books and was praised in his early years. Meng Yuanlong had the ambition of the sea and lakes and looked down upon others. Over the years, he has traveled mountains and rivers, and his nature has been accustomed to apes and cranes. He wields his brush to write forms, transmitting the Jiangling pink version in the style of Wu Daozi. He has fully acquired the spirit of Huang Gongwang's strangeness and the strength of Zhao Mengfu. Therefore, his free spirit is high in the mist, and his handsome feelings are light as the moon. He detaches himself from the rich and noble floating clouds and escapes from the dust of the world. The other day, he returned from Mount Lu and collaborated with Shou Tie on many pages of fan paintings. One of the paintings is Viewing the Waterfall. He titled it: "I returned from Mount Lu after seeing the waterfall. The strange energy in my chest is chaotic. Uncle Cliff sees a foot of paper from me. The light is full before the small room is opened. A clump of old trees is gathered. The old man carries his hands and his eyebrows are short. The soul of Shi Tao, the spirit of Shi Xi, embraces drunkenness, sings wildly, and cannot turn. I will add a picture of Tianchi for you. The stone walls are thousands of feet high, and the spring is hundreds of feet long. When shall I enter the painting with you and sit and lie down all year without returning?" Reading this poem, his ambition can be seen. This is currently on display in the fan painting exhibition of the Art Appreciation Society in Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road. They are a perfect combination, chasing the creation of nature, and are not ordinary works.</p>

<h3 id="e230">The Origin of the Old Saying, "Amber Picks Up Mustard Seeds" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Li Mi</p>
<p>Old Ma Xiang discussed the original objects. He said that the sayings "amber picks up mustard seeds" and "lodestone attracts needles" were discovered as early as the Han Dynasty. Mr. Cao Zhongyuan, because he extracted from an English book on wireless telegraphy the statement that our country's Guo Pu invented physics and had this theory, sent a letter to Old Ma Xiang, inquiring about its origin. Old Ma Xiang replied that it was seen in Wang Bi's commentary on the Book of Changes. In my humble opinion, the commentary on the Book of Changes quoted by Old Ma Xiang is actually Kong Yingda's "Correct Meaning" from the early Tang Dynasty, mistakenly taken to be Wang Bi's commentary from the Wei Dynasty. Research shows that the sayings "picks up mustard seeds" and "attracts needles" first appeared in Wang Chong's "Lunheng, Chaotic Dragons" chapter. It says, "Dunmu picks up mustard seeds, lodestone attracts needles, all based on truth, not relying on other things." It also recounts Liu Zijun's handling of the earth dragon ceremony. Huan Junshan questioned whether Dunmu and lodestone could truly pick up needles and mustard seeds. Zijun was at a loss to respond. This historical fact shows that these two sayings existed at the end of the Western Han Dynasty. Wang Chong was a disciple of Ban Biao. When Emperor Suzong was in power, he was almost seventy years old. He was senior to Liu and Huan. Old Ma Xiang's statement that it was discovered in the Han Dynasty, although not explicitly stated, is essentially in agreement. However, it doesn't say "amber picks up mustard seeds" but "Dunmu picks up mustard seeds." Dunmu is tortoise shell. Guo Pu's "Mountain and Sea Classic Picture Praise" says, "Amber picks up mustard seeds." One version replaces amber with tortoise shell. However, amber, when rubbed and heated, can pick up mustard seeds, clearly demonstrating experience, which has been passed down to this day. But there has never been any real evidence that tortoise shell can pick up mustard seeds. My humble opinion is that amber is produced in the Western Regions. Ban Gu's "Book of Han" says it comes from Bin Yuquan. Wei's "Short History" says it comes from Da Qin. It is very clear that it is not native to China. In the first year of Emperor Wu of Han's Baoding era, the Western Regions offered rare treasures, including amber swallows, as seen in Wang Jia's "Lost Records." Emperor Xuan had a precious mirror from India, stored in a tiger-amber tube, as seen in Wu Jun's "Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital." All these things were considered rare and precious. Probably, when Liu and Huan lived, it was not long after the reigns of Emperors Wu and Xuan. The object was not commonly seen, and the name was not fixed. Because amber's luster resembled tortoise shell, it was mistakenly called Dunmu. Tortoise shell does not truly pick up mustard seeds; it is merely another physical discovery. The annotation to Yu Fan's biography in the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" quotes Wei Zhao's "Book of Wu." It says that when Fan was twelve years old, he wrote to someone, "I have heard that amber does not pick up rotten mustard seeds, and lodestone does not accept crooked needles. Is it not fitting to not dwell on past mistakes?" Here, amber is written correctly. At that time, Fan lived at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. When Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty annotated the "Mountain and Sea Classic" and wrote the "Picture Praise," the "North Mountain Classic Picture Praise" says, "Lodestone attracts iron, amber picks up mustard seeds. The qi has a hidden attraction, and the numbers mysteriously coincide. The attraction of objects is beyond expectation." According to Pu's praise, it is actually based on Dong Zhongshu's "Spring and Autumn Dew Collection, Suburban Language" chapter, which says, "Lodestone attracts iron, pure gold attracts fire. It is strange and amazing, not something people expect." As for Pu's two volumes of "Picture Praise," the original version has long been lost. It exists in the Daoist canon, but it is not the original. Zhang Pu of the Ming Dynasty compiled "Guo Hongnong's Collection" based on the canon version, fully recording the praise text. This is exactly the source that Mr. Cao inquired about, but Old Ma Xiang missed mentioning it. However, the English book on electricity considered it to be an original theory of Guo Pu in the fourth century. Little does it know that elegant sayings are passed down with distant origins. Before Guo Pu was Yu Fan, before Fan was Wang Chong, and before Chong were Liu Xin and Huan Tan. Liu and Huan lived during the reigns of Emperors Ai and Ping, which was at the beginning of the Western era. This is something that should be known. Furthermore, amber is not produced in China. Its discovery of picking up mustard seeds should have been during the Western Han Dynasty. As for lodestone, it first appeared in the "Shen Nong's Materia Medica." By the time of the Yellow Emperor's construction of the south-pointing chariot, the principle of attracting iron had already been discovered. However, the Materia Medica claims that lodestone points south, usually deviating towards the Bing position, because Bing represents great fire, and Geng and Xin metals are controlled by it, which is nothing more than speculation. As the "Lüshi Chunqiu, Profound Understanding" chapter says, "Lodestone summons iron, or draws it." Buwei only mentions lodestone and not amber, which can be taken as evidence that there was no amber during the Qin Dynasty. Therefore, the two sayings "picks up mustard seeds" and "attracts needles," though connected, arose at the end of the Western Han Dynasty, but the physical discoveries and the order of the times have their reasons, which should also be known. Living in solitude without anything to do, I have jotted down these random notes to supplement Old Ma Xiang's incompleteness and to resolve Mr. Cao's confusion.</p>
<p>Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" says that the mustard seeds picked up by amber are actually the grasses of the mustard plant. Lei says that it is a mistake to say "mustard seeds" based on the English book. The meaning seems to also be mustard seeds. Also, Guo Pu's praise of lodestone, quoted in the "Classified Collection of Literary Works" volume six, is not from "Bai Kong's Six Postings." I am including this to inform Mr. Cao and to provide materials for verification.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Peeking at the Military Flags in a Small, Remote Town; Flattering and Following the Servants of an Insignificant Group</p>
<p>At the end of Chapter Ten of this book, An Yutian had just met Ye Zuozhang and roughly settled the matter of pacification. After returning to the hotel, he told Liang Xiaoyun the details. Upon hearing that the official business had been handed over to the Chief of Staff by Ye Zuozhang, Liang Xiaoyun suggested that they should give some face to the Chief of Staff who was handling the matter. She told An Yutian to specifically pay a visit to the Chief of Staff the next day, humbly asking him for guidance and attention in everything, so that the official document could be processed and issued quickly in order to proceed rapidly. The name of this Chief of Staff was Bai Shanxun. Among all the senior military officers under Ye Zuozhang, he was considered the best of the mediocre. He had graduated from a military academy in Japan and was not an ignorant fool. However, since he had attached himself to a warlord as Chief of Staff, he had to comply with the wishes of his supervisor in everything. After seeing An Yutian, he said coldly with a stern face, "I am the most agreeable person. Whatever the Old General asks me to do, I will only comply and not offer any other opinions. Your official document will be processed in half a day and someone will be sent to deliver it to you. As for the rest, we'll talk about it later." After saying this, he returned to his seat by his desk and continued to review documents as usual, ignoring An Yutian. An Yutian did not want to disturb him further and politely took his leave. The Chief of Staff nodded slightly but did not get up to see him off. Fortunately, An Yutian had gained some experience by this time and knew that the reason Chief of Staff Bai was giving him the cold shoulder was not because he was genuinely dissatisfied with him or looked down on him, but because the issue of gifts and personal connections was still at play. After discussing it again with Liang Xiaoyun upon his return, they originally intended to use the same old method of dealing with Section Chief Wan Chengqi and clear this path as well. However, unexpectedly, the official document was delivered the next day. After rewarding the messenger soldier with ten dollars and leaving the official document behind, the hotel's accountant, servants, and chauffeur all received this information. They all came to congratulate them. The couple was so happy that they temporarily put aside the matter of taking care of Chief of Staff Bai. Afterwards, they spent another two days together going to the government office to thank Ye Zuozhang and the Fifth Madam, and visiting guests everywhere, connecting with all the important people in the Governor's office. Only then did they gradually find some leisure.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Financial and Gold Market Extremely Quiet <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>A slight drop of one or two taels: Yesterday, the gold market situation was particularly peaceful, with a slight decline. The overall market fluctuated around three taels and eventually decreased by a small amount of one tael. It was weak from the morning, likely due to the recovery of British silver and the rise in silver futures. Later, foreign exchange eased and then strengthened, and bank purchases were not quiet, which slightly stabilized it. However, there were occasional fluctuations of one or two taels. The after-market felt even more mediocre, fluctuating around 753 taels. The trading volume of various firms was quite low, mainly because today (the 1st) begins a three-day closure for business, so everyone dared not to start, in order to prevent the risk of market changes after the opening. Now, the full-day details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening down two taels and nine mace: The market opened in the morning of August, falling two taels and nine mace to 751 taels and six mace. The large sliver recovered one-sixteenth, and American silver remained the same, private telegraphs increased by one-sixteenth, so people’s hearts went down. However, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongbingxing first came in, immediately pulling one tael, for fifty-two taels and six mace, but Tontchun, Shunli, Yuanmao, Yongyuanchun, etc., all came out, immediately dropping more than one tael, to fifty-one taels and two mace. Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yonghengyu, Yongfeng came in, and HSBC absorbed the current Citibank at 625, Mitsui absorbed November at 125, then the price rose by two taels, but in an instant, there was a circulation of more than one tael, to fifty-three taels and one mace at 9:30. HSBC listed the price without change, at two taels and seven mace. Yuanmao Yong sold some, but the market stabilized. Then Fuyu, Yifeng, Yonghengyu, Yuanheng, Hengxing, Fuxingyong and other came in, suddenly adding one tael and a half, at fifty-four taels and two mace at 9:50. Then Hongli, Yuanheng, Zhifengyong, Tongchun, Yuanda, Yongbingxing and other sold out, and because the October US dollar could be settled at 30.0125 yuan, it fell by more than two taels, at fifty-one taels and eight mace at 10:00. After that, it seemed to go up, but with only a few mace fluctuating, hovering between fifty-three taels, buyers showed strong buying interest, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Yifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanxingyong, Hongkangyong, Hengyu and others all came in, and it was heard that Shoufongyong sold US dollars, then settled the note, rising to fifty-four taels and three mace at 11:30. Hua Bi and other absorbed November US dollars at 125. Later, there were seven or eight mace plate heads with each other. Near noon, Yuanxingyong and other came in, causing the price to increase from three taels and a half to four taels and two mace, goods scattered, retailers and on the table all slightly spit out. At the close, it was fifty-three taels and four mace.</p>
<p>The aftermarket is a scene of desolation: The aftermarket opened at fifty-three taels and three mace, then from three taels and one mace to three taels and five. Later, because Hengyu, Hongkangyong and others sold out, it fell by a small amount of one tael to 2:45 at fifty-two taels and three mace. After entering the wheat trade, it absorbed November US dollars at 125, Zhejiang entered July at 5625, Yuanxingyong Yifengyong came in, adding more than one tael, to fifty-three taels and a half at 3:05, but Hengyu's entry and exit were inconsistent, Daxingyong slightly out, when it was three taels and one mace, not long after, Yifeng, Yuhe and Zhifeng Yongchang were pulled in, the price was pushed forward four or five mace, at three taels and six mace at 3:45, but HSBC came out with September US dollars at 825, and Hengxing sold out at a limited price, until after 4:00, it was three taels and one mace, but the transaction was particularly small, the number of people on the table was few, most of them went on a trip? Until the close at 4:30, it was fifty-three taels and four mace, slightly down one tael and one mace compared to the day before. The maximum was fifty-four taels and three mace, and the minimum was fifty-one taels and two mace, with a difference of three taels and one mace. The red strip increased by ten taels.</p>
<p>The listed price is mostly pressed down by two taels: The listed price is still eight hundred and twenty taels, pressing down sixty-six or sixty-seven taels, sixty-seven or sixty-eight taels to sixty-six or sixty-seven taels in the afternoon, pressing down two taels more than the previous day. The account is logged at fifty-eight taels in July, fifty-three taels in August, and fifty-eight taels to make up for the water, the same in the afternoon.</p>
<p>No large transactions at all: On-the-table transactions, receipts and payments are not equal, the number is very large, statistics show Dadecheng, Yuanfengyong, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Bingxing, Hengxing are all coming in. Shoufongyong set out the draft, and then came in with notes, Hengyu bought more and sold less, Yuanheng, Shunli, Wanxing had little entry and exit, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanda Yong, Tongchun, Daxingyong, Yuhe and Wu Ji all came out.

The Dalian gang altogether exited more than three hundred, entered more than four hundred, the Guangdong gang entered more than seven hundred, exited more than two hundred, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Exchange Market, British Currency Flat, US Currency Tight <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday’s silver market saw British currency rise and US currency stay flat. The fluctuations of the great sliver have been rapid recently, but the silver price still shows no sign of improvement or decline. The exchange rate between British and American currencies has been fluctuating slightly for three days. Almost all foreign exchange rates in the local market, British, American, Indian, and Po, showed no changes, except for the French Franc which decreased by one yuan, and German and other currencies decreased by 0.25. The Hong Kong dollar rose again by 0.25, to 78.125 taels. As for the internal market of banks, it was loose in the morning and strong later, and stable in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold was even, and US currency shrank slightly by 0.0625. However, the gold price showed a downward trend, so the quoted price was mostly suppressed by two taels. All US dollar forwards for hedging purposes were discounted by 27-28 taels. Transactions were not quiet at various firms. Generally, if forwards were sold, then near-term transactions were matched. It was heard that Shoufongyong alone sold 120,000 to 200,000 yuan of November currency, for a total transaction of about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. However, there were not many settlements. As for British currency, there were about 60,000 to 70,000 pounds, which was also being traded between banks. Chinese merchants had some inflows and outflows. Now, those who completed transactions throughout the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The internal market fluctuated by no more than 0.0625. In the morning, the selling price was 1 shilling and 7 pence, 75 to 875, and the buying price was 8125 to 9375.

The listed price was one yuan, equivalent to 3 taels, 4 mace, 1 fen, 88 li of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Busy with Semi-Annual Closing Period <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Interest and Silver Discount Continue to Soften</p>
<p>Copper Coins Exceed the 30,000 Cash Mark</p>
<p>Yesterday was the end of June and also the semi-annual closing period for the financial community, so procedures were quite busy. In the market, foreign interest continued to fall in the morning session, to 6 mace, 8 fen, 8 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, and half a si. The afternoon session rebounded by 0.25 hao, to 6 mace, 8 fen, 8 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and half a si. As a result, it was still lower by 0.125 hao than the lowest price of the previous day's afternoon session. Silver discount fell a total of 0.02 yuan, calculated as 0.06 yuan, the same for both morning and afternoon sessions, with an additional 0.06 or 0.07 yuan for water. The amount of foreign exchange drafts made was 845,000 yuan in the morning session and 555,000 yuan in the afternoon session.

Checks were 180,000 yuan in the morning session and 30,000 yuan in the afternoon session. Bank transactions were 800,000 yuan in the morning session and 500,000 yuan in the afternoon session. All kinds of silver and foreign currency settlements were too numerous, making it impossible to investigate. According to money shop estimates, silver public orders were approximately above 30 million and below 40 million. Foreign currency public orders were settled at least beyond 10 million. In addition, various settlements must be over 20 million, and the total amount of settlements is impossible to estimate. Jiangsu small foreign currency was 0.06 yuan for both morning and afternoon sessions, a slight increase of 0.0002 yuan compared to the previous day. Only 6,500 jiao were traded in the morning session. Guangdong small foreign currency was 0.05 yuan, 8 fen, 1 li, and 5 hao in the morning session and 0.05 yuan, 8 fen, 2 li, and 2.5 hao in the afternoon session. 120,000 jiao were traded in the morning session and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon session. The trend of extending copper coin loans has been increasing unabated. Yesterday, it increased again by 2,500 cash, exceeding the 30,000 cash mark, to 430,500 cash. Over 46,000 strings of cash were also traded.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Securities Exchange Closes Today for Settlement for Two Days <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Prices Rebounded Yesterday Afternoon Due to Stronger Buying Sentiment</p>
<p>Market Condition Slightly Clearer, Trading Volume 3.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading conditions on the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange for both futures and spot markets. For spot goods, only the demobilization bonds opened at 14,000 yuan, and all other items were only several thousand yuan, totaling 25,100 yuan. The futures market was average. The atmosphere of buyers and sellers in the market was clearer compared to before the settlement. The trading volume was estimated at over 2.1 million in the morning and about 1.6 million in the afternoon, totaling 3.7 million yuan. Among them, items such as the 20 Guan Bond, Unified Salt Tax, etc., each accounted for 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and the rest were around 300,000 yuan. The 96 Bonds and 6 Customs Taxes remained clear. As for the condition of various bonds, although the atmosphere was quite good in the two morning sessions, and buying and trading were not quiet, the selling side was still eager to sell, so although the price had rebounded compared to before the settlement, the supply and demand were very balanced, and price fluctuations were very small. The buying demand in the afternoon session was still strong, but the selling side suddenly became quiet, so the prices continued to rise strongly. As a result, the July demobilization bond rose by 2 yuan, the largest increase compared to before the settlement, and all other items also increased by about 1 yuan. However, some spot goods did not continue to rise due to the absence of a market in the afternoon. The Securities Exchange will be closed for two days starting today to handle the semi-annual settlement.</p>

<p>American Eastern Bank Company Report: Wednesday's stock trading in New York fell back to a low of 60 million shares, but market conditions were quite strong. Most stocks rebounded several points to more than one point. However, several important stocks, such as "General Motors," saw considerable selling. Public bonds also fell slightly. "Westinghouse Electric" stock suspended dividends, but increased prices, so its stock did not fall. Steel production this past week reached only 15%. Production is expected to continue to be low next week due to Independence Day. Commercial conditions and international news on Wednesday were not good, but the stock market was still strong. This can be considered a sign of strong public confidence. Attached is the Dow Jones Index as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e237">Local Cotton Yarn, Guangdong and Yunnan Dealers Continue Intentions <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with more actual requests compared to yesterday, but market prices are still trending downwards. Due to financial constraints, the Guangdong and Yunnan dealers are still active, while other groups are rarely moving. Furthermore, the financial situation is extremely tight, and the people are poor, with a lack of purchasing power. Except for the southern port route, there is little hope. The price of Japanese yarn is particularly low, and it is being aggressively promoted in secret. Local yarn is suffering from its impact. Japanese yarn is flooding the market in Tianjin and other places, with foreign goods everywhere. As a result, the position of Chinese yarn is being snatched away, so there is talk of transporting it to Shanghai to find a way out. It is rumored in the market that a certain 20-count yarn is priced at 125 taels, with 3,000 bales traded for the September, October, and November periods. If this situation is confirmed, the right to sell yarn domestically will be completely taken away by foreigners. The bid yarn market is closed for one day due to the end of the month. However, some are bullish due to the rising price of American cotton. However, based on actual measurements, factory inventories are growing thicker every day. The world economy is in decline, and the future cannot be overly optimistic. Recent market transactions show that most of the fine yarn transactions are occupied by Japanese merchants. Chinese factories only have sales of coarse yarn, which is regrettable. Today, 1,100 bales were traded on the market, with 10-count coarse yarn accounting for 600 bales. Hakka merchants imported 790 bales from Guangdong, 5 bales from Ningbo, 50 bales from Sichuan, 300 bales from Yunnan, 21 bales from the interior, and 5 bales from Wuhu. Prices fell 0.05 to 1 tael outside the region.</p>

<p>The price of American cotton rebounded by more than 20 pounds of sound, resulting in a firmer situation in the market. Also, most local cotton have high psychological expectations. Today, with the help of foreign cotton, people's confidence has further increased. However, based on the facts, there is still no capacity for a huge rise. Most factories have ample foreign cotton, and the yarn market is sluggish with tight credit. However, at present, American cotton is stable and selling pressure has decreased, so temporarily it may rebound a bit. At the pier, there are 1,780 bales of Yao flowers, which have not yet been opened.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to good news from Liverpool, poor harvest conditions, and short covering. Futures rose 10 to 17 points, and spot rose 20 points. British cotton futures rose 3 to 4 points, and spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 5 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Pingguoer rising 1.5 rupees, Aomula rising 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising 1.25 rupees. Original telegram record on the left (telegraphed on the 29th):</p>

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, only 10 ships arrived from various groups, and stocks in the port gradually thinned. Shops in the city and countryside relied on daily diminishing arrivals. Moreover, it was the end of the lunar month, the period when businesses on both sides close accounts. Transactions were not good. Changxi and Subei japonica rice and Jiangsu merchants each raised 0.2 yuan. Although the sales of thin indica rice were not smooth, the market price also increased by about 0.1 yuan due to limited goods. Foreign Duyi rice's arrivals and sales were balanced, and the market was mediocre. There were few variable dollar loans. However, the digestive system was sluggish. The foreign rice Tianjin merchants slightly handled, while the local street still felt ordinary, causing the price to temporarily remain stable.</p>
<p>Xin: Yesterday, the source of various merchants in the rice market was not large, resulting in a decrease in ship cargo in the local port. Trading on the local street was quite busy in the morning. Changxi top goods sold slightly actively, and the price rose by about 0.1 yuan. The situation of early and late indica rice appeared tight. Luyang tip also rose in price by nearly 0.1 yuan following the japonica market. Kunsu rice was scarce and the market stable. Variable dollar arrivals and sales were balanced, and the market had no rise or fall. There were no shady yuan goods on the market. The full-day river cargo opened at about 3,000 shi.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation inherited the momentum of the Tianjin merchant's launch the day before, and people's confidence was very good. Local streets were even busier. Overall, the market moved over 8,000 small twisted bags, and rural scattered households also made some inquiries. The market price immediately rose 0.05-0.06 yuan. If there are more merchants inquiring in the future, the market will surely see a step-by-step increase. There have not been many foreign rice arrivals recently. With strong sales, the market immediately saw a turning point. If the market continues to be consumed by domestic merchants, the market price can stand firm even with arrivals. Therefore</p>

<p>Yesterday in the powder market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month still showed a trend of being weak in the near term and stable in the long term, continuing to show signs of new records. The quoted price of foreign wheat continued to drop by about two dimes, while the market's sluggishness gradually increased. The current quoted price of flour in Tianjin telegrams fell to two dollars and eight dimes, but sales were still active, estimated at forty to fifty thousand. Since the situation in the actual sales areas is not strong, the situation in Shanghai is naturally difficult to be optimistic about. Both large and small factories still have abundant reserves. Given the current situation of external difficulties and internal supply disruptions, it is impossible to expand, so they can only gradually release their stock onto the market to slightly remedy the situation. However, the decline in the long term is very slight due to the firmness of customer sentiment. As a result, the prices for July and August fell by 1.25 cents compared to the previous day, September fell by 1 cent, and October and November fell by 0.25 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the forward wheat market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a trend of decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat continued to drop by about two dimes, and the price of wheat in various inland producing areas, consolidated in Shanghai, was all around the three dollars and two dimes mark. Although there is no settlement this month, there should be actual impetus by July. Both buyers and sellers seem to be preparing for this, so although the environment is not good, the decline is still not significant. As a result, the prices for July and August each fell by three cents compared to the previous day, September fell by two cents, and October and November fell by three cents. The current wheat market is still stable, and factory purchases are also active. The price of wheat from Weiting is two dollars and nine dimes, Huangdai wheat is two dollars and nine dimes and two cents, Shuangfeng wheat is two dollars and nine dimes, then eight dimes and five cents, Penglai wheat is two dollars and eight dimes and six cents, then down to eight dimes, and Wusong wheat is two dollars and eight dimes, totaling 4,200 bags.</p>

<p>The cost for gray silk merchants is above six hundred taels.</p>
<p>They are now petitioning the government to allocate funds for subsidies according to the case.</p>
<p>The export of eight-cocoon gray silk to Europe has declined sharply. Superior silk has fallen to 280 taels. Yesterday, Dachan and other firms sold 30 packages of superior gray silk, but the price was only 275 taels, a further drop of 5 taels compared to the previous price. The cost for gray silk merchants is above 600 taels, and each package must suffer a loss of 60%. Therefore, they are unwilling to sell more. They are now petitioning the government to request a subsidy of 100 taels per package, according to the Jiangzhe factory silk relief measures, to maintain the current situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the local foreign tea market, Tunxi's high-grade precious eyebrow green tea, Yingzhuang Jinlong, Yihua, Xiehe, and other firms all started operating, and the market situation became more active. The selling price has become slightly firmer than before. Transactions of needle eyebrow and show eyebrow green tea are particularly active, and the market price has increased by two to three taels. There were also sporadic transactions of other items such as Gongxi pearl tea. The green tea market has a good momentum of gradually improving. However, there have been no telegrams from England to Shanghai regarding Qining black tea in recent days, and the path to sales has become stagnant.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Manufacturing Method of Bleaching Powder (Part 1) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yunli</p>
<p>To bleach silk, wool, cotton, linen, paper, and other materials, bleaching agents such as chlorine, potassium dichromate, sodium percarbonate, percarbonate, potassium permanganate, and bleaching powder are used. Among these bleaching agents, the most common is bleaching powder. Bleaching powder not only has the function of bleaching but also has the effect of sterilization, so it is very beneficial to mankind. I am now going to introduce the method of manufacturing bleaching powder:</p>
<p>(1) Raw Materials: The raw materials for bleaching powder are chlorine gas and lime. To manufacture bleaching powder, one must first prepare chlorine gas and lime.</p>
<p>(A) Chlorine Gas Manufacturing Method: Put four parts hydrochloric acid and one part manganese dioxide into a flask. Seal the flask tightly with a cork with a hole. Then, use a curved glass tube or rubber tube, insert one end into the hole of the cork, and prepare the other end to be inserted into the hole in the upper or lower part of the bleaching powder box. After preparing in this way, place the flask on a tripod, next to the wooden box, and when manufacturing bleaching powder, use an alcohol lamp to heat under the flask, and chlorine gas will flow into the box through the glass tube.</p>
<p>(B) Lime Selection Method: The quality of the lime is greatly related to the finished product of bleaching powder. When manufacturing, it is advisable to choose thoroughly burned lime chunks, especially newly burned lime, and it is absolutely impossible to use loose lime that has been exposed to the air for a long time. Because loose lime has already absorbed moisture, it cannot absorb a large amount of chlorine gas. After selecting the lime, it is advisable to sprinkle clear water to make it moist and cracked, becoming powder. If there are hard, unburned chunks, they must be screened out with a sieve. But pay attention: the water should not be sprinkled too wet or unevenly. If it is too wet, it will become lime milk and cannot be used. If it is uneven, the ability to absorb chlorine gas will be weak when manufacturing bleaching powder.</p>
<p>(2) Arrangement Method of Manufacturing Box: To manufacture bleaching powder, a wooden box about one foot five inches long and about two feet seven inches high can be used. The inside of the box is lined with lead to prevent corrosion. The middle of the box is separated into six or seven layers with wooden boards, and the distance between each layer is about four inches. However, these wooden boards should be installed so that they can be moved, so that lime can be put in or taken out. Three or four inch square small glass windows should be opened at both ends of the box, so that the shape of the chlorine gas entering the box and combining with the lime can be observed. A small hole should be opened at the upper and lower parts of the box, for introducing chlorine gas. But when the glass tube is inserted into the upper hole, the lower hole should be tightly closed. If the glass tube is replaced and inserted into the lower hole, the upper hole should be tightly closed. After preparing in this way, it is considered successful.</p>

<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>If you walk down the street, sometimes you can see various signs hanging at the entrance of a house or alley, such as XX Opera House or XX Society. At night, you can hear the sound of gongs, drums, and fiddles coming from these houses with hanging signs. If you are drawn by curiosity and go inside to visit, you can see that these houses are full of people, sitting, standing, with all kinds of people. These people range from foreign firm employees to courtesans, and everything in between. In addition, you can also see several strangely dressed drama teachers and several slick music masters who play the fiddle and drums.</p>
<p>"Old Wang, sing a song!" So, the one called Old Wang takes a sip of tea, moistens his throat, tells the fiddler to start playing, and then there is a burst of "The shopkeeper has brought over the yellow horse..." After singing a section, he undoubtedly sings very proudly, but he usually has to be humble for a few words, and the others are also complimenting him as usual, although in the hearts of these famous people are filled with many: "Your singing of selling horses is neither the Tan style nor the Yu style," "You shouldn't have dropped the beat on the middle eye in the second sentence," "You should have taken a breath when singing that long phrase," and other dissatisfaction and contempt.</p>
<p>If you inspect those houses, in the beautiful frames hanging on the wall, you can see the charter of their group organization, with the purpose item prominently written: "Our society aims to study art and connect feelings." At that time, you can't help but have doubts in your mind, "What kind of art is this studying? What kind of feelings are they connecting?"</p>
<p>If you are unwilling to be nosy, stay longer, and make further investigations, then leave that place. When you walk out of those noisy and dusty houses, you can take a big breath of fresh air outside.</p>
<p>I myself have also been in and out of opera houses, and I myself have also been called an amateur performer, but what benefits do these opera houses and amateur performers have for society and life? Even I myself am inexplicable!</p>

<p>— Moyi</p>
<p>The garret has been empty for more than a month; today, a young man who looks like a seventeen or eighteen-year-old student rented it for a monthly rent of six dollars. The landlady stood in the yard, squinting at the young man directing the rickshaw puller to move his simple furniture and luggage. She felt that the young man reflected in her eyes was the same as the lovely young man in her dream last night. Her husband, who was twelve years older than her, worked on a ship and only came back three or four days a month. Only twenty-one years old, she often watched the young couples in the neighborhood during the day, and her heart often stirred up waves of jealousy; at night, she slept alone in bed, and her whole body was often attacked by an inexplicable feeling of depression, and the laughter of the young couples coming from next door was even more embarrassing for her, thinking that they were giving her great humiliation. So, she took one of the young men in the neighborhood as the object of her pursuit of happiness, and fantasized about rosy dreams; in her dreams, she got sweet kisses, hugs, loving jokes, and carnal revelry. Today, a young man suddenly moved into her house, and she thought it was a gift from God. This seventeen or eighteen-year-old young man, she thought, was a child - a child who had not been baptized by love, as long as she let him taste a little bit of love, she could get the enjoyment of youth. She was thinking wildly, when she suddenly heard the young man say to her in a low voice:</p>
<p>"The things are moved in. Should the gate be closed?" "Oh... oh... oh..." She didn't know what she was saying in her mouth, and her face was burning hot. She calmed down and gave him a very charming smile, her face flushed, and slowly walked over to close the gate. She involuntarily followed him to the garret.</p>
<p>She chatted with him in his room for a while; she knew that he was studying in a middle school not far from her house. Because the dormitory in the school was already full of people, he lived outside the school; but as soon as the new dormitory being built was completed, he would move in. She hoped that this new dormitory would be completed after she and he were already immersed in the river of love, and that at that time, he would not have the heart to move away from her arms.</p>
<p>In the morning, she gave him water to wash his face and tidied up his bedding. In the afternoon, when he came back, she specially made a few dishes for him with her own hands and kept him to eat dinner together. She chatted with him, pulling this way and that, and was surprised that she always had so much to say. Sometimes, she gave him a few hints; these hints included all her hopes and passionate love for him. And he seemed to be a fool, not showing anything at all, and seeming not to feel her hints. He lowered his head and blushed, feeling his pulse beating very hard, pressed by her several blatant expressions of love and strong temptations of the opposite sex. Looking at him like this, although she felt very disappointed, she understood that he was still a shy child, and his childlike heart had not been shot by Cupid's arrow. However, for some reason, she couldn't sleep even more at night, and even had no sweet dreams, and her heart was only filled with unbearable melancholy.</p>
<p>He spent more than twenty days in such an atmosphere full of stimulation of the opposite sex. Sometimes he really felt suffocated; but sometimes he thought that the sweet dew of love was irrigating his heart, and perhaps one day it would grow out the tender shoots of love. One day, when he came back in the afternoon, he didn't see her at the door, who welcomed him every day. He was surprised. He entered the door, but there was no sign of her in the yard or in his own room. He put down his books and had just sat down on the chair when she came in. She said in a low voice with a smile:</p>
<p>"Two relatives came from the countryside today. How annoying. They're going to stay here for more than ten days!" After saying that, she smiled and left.</p>
<p>Since her relatives came, he rarely spoke to her; he had to tidy up his bedding himself; and she didn't eat with him anymore. On the contrary, he felt that without her nagging beside him, his life was much quieter. On the fourth day, he said to her apologetically:</p>
<p>"The school's new dormitory has been completed. I'm going to move in."</p>
<p>She stood beside her relatives, her eyes wide with disappointment, a melancholy smile on her face, watching him direct the rickshaw puller to move his simple furniture and luggage away.</p>

<h3 id="e250">The Art of Speaking <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Master</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, after dinner, my mother jokingly asked a country woman who had just come out and had not been baptized in society, "Do you know how old I am this year?" The woman replied, "I see that madam is at least in her sixties." When we heard it, we couldn't help but burst into laughter, and my mother laughed as well. Because we thought that the woman was really honest and funny. In fact, my mother is not yet sixty years old. Of course, others would say, "Madam is young." But she said, "Madam is at least in her sixties." How could it not be funny? In fact, perhaps she had another kind of psychology, thinking that being old is a blessing and she did not say anything wrong; however, how would she know that she would instead earn us a burst of laughter, making her inexplicable?</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that the psychology of not wanting to be old is the most common. Often, some people are indeed old, but they insist that others say they are young, especially women, most of whom have this psychology. But there are some people who want to act old and be old-fashioned. Even though they are not yet fifty years old, they insist that others say they are old, and even call themselves "old man" or "old woman." If someone says "young," they will be unhappy. Then, the reason why the woman said that my mother was more than sixty years old may be an expression of this psychology. However, people's psychologies are different. What she thought was correct, others thought was incorrect and funny. From this small and unimportant matter, I have come to realize that when it comes to speaking, one must also have art, especially in modern society, otherwise one cannot cater to people's psychologies and is just a "fool"!</p>
