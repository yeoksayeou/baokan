<p>（南京）外交界息、國聯特別大會定六日上午　時開幕、參加者五十七國、大會主席仍爲比外相希孟、六日首次大會程序、據政府接日內瓦電告、㈠主席宣布召集特別大會原因、及對此次大會之希望、㈡中國首席代表顏惠慶演說、㈢日首席代表松岡演說、㈣其他各國代表發言、六日上下午均公開大會、共開會四天、預定九日閉幕、僅準備通　李頓報告書前八章事實部份、及對不承認僞國等局部决議、决不作含有强迫性之切實舉動、至具體解决辦法、將再移交十九國委員會、又此次大會、其他各國代表願發言者甚多英首相麥唐納·法總理赫禮歐、均已到日內瓦親自出席、頗爲各方重視、（五日專電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國際聯盟特別大會、定明日上午十一時開會、（上海時間爲下午六時）屆時五十五國代表將齊到、我國代表要求大會切實决定以會章十五條解决中日紛爭、日代表將要求各國承認其手創僞國、謂若反對滿洲國、則遠東和平不保、意在以世界大戰恫嚇各國、一面又强辯在東省每日之對陣非屬戰爭、日軍行動尙未破壞和平、故反對援用十五條、據料明日各小國將羣起反對日本之狡辯、（五日華聯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯各小國會員、雖渴望維持和平公約、但各大國顯不欲於此時取任何切實行動、預料國聯大會、或將令十九國委員會向大會作最後解决辦法之建議、此項建議、即可作爲對於中國請求解决東北事件之答覆　但仍不堵塞中日進一步和解之途徑、一般觀察、現已到最重時期、中國政府亟應抱定在不損國權下、解决本案之確實條件、以爲準備云、（四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>顧維鈞駁斥松岡言論及日本意見書</h3>
<p>日方謬論不能</p>
<p>動搖李頓報告</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯秘書處今日散佈顧維鈞博士所送交之長文對於松岡對行政院而發之言論、及日本對於李頓報告書之意見、加以駁斥、謂日方之意見書與言論、皆無一處可變更李頓調查團所查見滿洲時局實中之最重要事件、或李頓調查團由此事而得之論斷、</p>
<p>僞國必須解散損失必須賠償　一九三一年九月十八日之事變、確爲日軍當道所造成、以進行其在亞洲大陸上侵略與擴拓之傅統政策已屬毫無疑義、日本雖向國聯屢發諾言、不使時局愈臻嚴重、然軍事行動擴至東三省極遠地方、繼續不已、實施其準備已久之攻擊、而謀佔據東三省全部、中國治權之摧毀、獨立運動之組織、「滿洲國」之設立、「滿洲國」之承認、乃一定程序中各階級、民衆大會、示威行動、及代表團之呈遞請願文、皆完全出於日人之佈置、藉以　惑他國、日本基本主義、在以已成事實、表示日本支配與征服遠東政策中第二幕之完成者、而與世界相抗、然中國之利益、東三省之主權、及日本侵略之犧牲、究不容漠視、是以日軍之撤退、宜儘速實施、東三省現狀之維持與承認、中國絕不能接受、故解散「滿洲國」、乃任何美滿解决方法中必不可少之條件、爲維護基於公道之和平計、侵略决不應寬恕、而爲侵略之犧牲者、尤須予以完全之賠償、</p>
<p>日本不守信義破壞條約義務　日方以爲李頓調查團所主張之計畫、至少要兩造各有堅强可恃之中央政府、要知中國始終尊重國際之義務、而日本爲及早解决計、則須有可恃的中央政府、蓋國聯與列强已有痛苦經騐、而知日本在國聯盟約下非戰公約下與九國公約下所擔任之荘嚴義務已被破壞矣、日代表所給予之各種允諾、類如不攻錦州與齊齊哈爾、撤回日軍至鐵路區域、及停止政治與軍事增重事態之舉動等事、無一實行、在中國代表團觀之、國際交涉中、寗願有雖弱而可恃之政府、而不願有堅強而不可恃之政府、蓋不可恃之政府、乃國際秩序基本之危害也、</p>
<p>中日問題之解决應適合和平公約　中代表文中證引李頓報告書第　百二十九頁、謂除中日兩國外、他國在中日衝突中、亦有不可不防衛之重要利益、凡協定之任何眞心與持久的解决、必須與世界和平所繫之多方面條約規定相適合、國聯盟約與非戰公約原則之適用、苟在世界　處喪失信用、則此原則之價値與效能、將在世界各處减少、中政府忠於國際義務、常以一般和平爲念、故與調查團同一見解、亦以爲中日問題之任何解决、須到合國聯盟約非戰公約九國公約之條文云、</p>
<p>東三省義勇軍正與日軍奮鬬　中代表此次意見書、共長四十八頁、對於遠東時局及日本在此問題上之意見、加以極詳細之發揮、言及中日情形及日本大陸政策、謂此種政策、乃今日日本財政與社會不寗靜之主因、日本刻在軍閥掌握中云、中代表文中否認中國排外情感之說、引證日人學校敎科書中排外之各課、又謂排貨之責任、在日本而不在中國、排貨之原因、日本負責、如原因銷滅、則排貨運動亦隨之而消滅、東三省在外交上始終被認爲中國整個的部分、日本所謂在東三省有特殊地位者、不過爲其亞陸上擴拓征服政策之假面具耳、文中詳言九一八事變與「滿洲國」設立事、繼謂調查團共收來函一千五百四十八封、皆反對僞邦之成立、此事並非謂凡未上書調團查者、皆擁護僞邦也、中國軍民數十萬、刻仍在東三省各處與日滿軍奮鬥、此足爲當地人民反對僞邦之明證、文中略述東三省現狀、謂該處人民現處於日本恐怖治權之下、報紙新聞、全被檢查、無辜人民、多被逮捕、村荘無端被轟、日人且濫殺平民、總之、東三省情形極爲慘怖也云云、</p>
<h3>中日代表用無線電舌戰</h3>
<p>顏惠慶請國聯從速解决</p>
<p>松岡洋右要求國聯忍耐</p>
<p>（日內瓦）松岡與顏惠慶今日相繼用播音無線電、各陳述其政府之理由、日代表先發言、中代表繼之、皆用英語演請、歐美全部、皆可聞之、松岡謂日本不欲有滿洲、日本所求於國聯者、忍耐而已、日本欲永遠與國聯合作、中政府不能管理其自已土地、又焉能要求對於附屬地之治權、「滿洲國」候匪亂平息後、即可繁榮、而與中國人民在其本國境內之受苦情形　不相同、日本願有和平、願與國聯永久合作、日本甚惋惜國聯之倉促行爲、日本以爲國聯日後亦將悔之云、顏惠慶博士稱、中國依據國聯盟約、享有國聯從速解决滿洲問題之權利、若國聯不即解决之、則不獨釀成更多之流血慘禍、增加東北三千萬人民之痛苦、且將使世人對於國聯之信任、視國聯爲和平與公道之柱石者、喪失至不堪收拾之地位、顏博士追述一年來事件、謂日本屢次侵略行爲、其有意侵入鄰邦、以逞其　拓土地之野心、不惜破壞國聯盟約非戰公約與九國公約、已屬毫無疑義、日本不履行其撤兵之諾言、且仍陸續前進、而鞏固其在中國東三省之地位、李頓勳爵近在英國上院演說、有國聯趕緊辦理此事、此其時矣、如聽令滿洲問題一再延宕、則危害實甚等語、李頓此言、至可玩味云、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>日代表會見西門與台維斯</h3>
<p>利用軍縮提案機會</p>
<p>交換中日問題意見</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今晨十時半（即上海時爲下午五時半）、美國軍縮代表台維斯與英首相麥唐納及西門外長、會商縮軍問題與戰債問題、及十一時一刻法首相赫禮歐與彭古陸長亦到、英法美三頭會議內容未明、日松岡亦往訪英首相及英外長、囑以大國力量壓制小國、（五日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）日內瓦來電、日軍縮代表部準備提出日本海軍軍縮案、已經完畢、松平代表與永野代表、决定五日上午訪問英國西門與美國台維斯兩代表、說明日本軍縮案內容、永野代表佐藤代表對法意兩國提示軍縮案內容、但向國聯正式提出或在數日之後、松平代表擬於會見英外相西門時、懇談中日問題、因西門外相爲英國之中日問題担任者、故其會見結果頗堪注目佐藤全權亦擬覓機會、與法意方面談論中日問題、（五日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）日本軍縮會議代表松平大使、定五日上午訪英美兩國軍縮代表、佐藤大使訪法意代表、長谷川少將訪各國陪　、各分頭解說日本軍縮新提案內容、按日本之新提案、目的在抵制美國海軍、獨覇太平洋、據傳美代表已接到駐華武官報告、謂日本將藉「滿洲國」名義、建設「滿洲國」大海軍、以爲已用、在實質上破壞英美日海軍均勢、美代表如何對付日本之新提案、頗堪注目、（四日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>大會中松岡演說內容</h3>
<p>力言日政府除承認僞國外</p>
<p>無保持遠東永遠和平之法</p>
<p>（日內瓦）松岡首席全權、在六日總會第一日之演說草稿、已大體脫稿、松岡昨夜謝絕訪客、草至深夜始畢、總會將先由中國代表演說、且中國代表部之意見會、將於五日發表、故須詳細討論之後、對草稿爲適當之修正、演說草稿、其文甚長、苟對於日政府之立場、毫不危害、則松岡全權之演說與主旨、與在理事會及其他無大差殊、不過比在理事會更從遠東和平之高處、觸及中日問題之核心、力言日本政府除承認「滿洲國」外、無保持遠東永遠和平之法、屆時豫期松岡代表之大雄辯云、（五日電通社電）</p>
<h3>內田謂中日問題急速解决因難</h3>
<p>日政府態度不變更</p>
<p>（東京）關於明日所開之國聯臨時大會、內田外相對記者之談話如下、國聯臨時大會雖開會、而日政府之態度毫不變化、爲維持滿洲之獨立、及繼持遠東之和平、毋須別項之準備、若主張從前之主張即足、一切之裁量、已委諸松岡代表、國聯非專爲處理中日問題、若歐美諸國最近最重要之問題、如軍縮問題與戰債問題等、多如山積、日本因與如中國之特殊事情爲對手、故急速解决甚爲困難、要以長久之氣候爲必要也、（五日電通社電）</p>
<h3>松岡虛聲恫嚇</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯臨時大會將於明日開會、今日松岡代表對記者談話如下、明日將開大會、各項準備亦已就緒、亦已决定覺悟、予之心　可謂無　點暗雲、現依由東京出發之際、與民衆所約束之所信邁進、此信念爲堂堂之正義、與民衆一致之應援、當毫無所懼、而頗堅強出、滿洲問題從來爲歐美諸國所曲解、而擾亂東洋和平者、無論何人、日本皆所不容忽視、一再忍耐、而今竟不能再忍、致日本不能一採自衛手叚、與維持和平手叚、若忽視則遠東和平勢將難保、在大會時、小國將猛烈活動、但予不懼若輩之策動、小國之所以神經過敏者、因係大國之壓迫、以爲日本亦將壓迫小國、予於此點在大會將充分說明日本之眞意、以校正小國之錯覺、日本爲獲得遠東之和平、而决非窘逼小國、係基於日本傳統之助弱挫强之精神而爲之也、日本未嘗壓迫小國、即將來亦永久傾向小國方面、欲一掃小國方面之迷夢、而予之演說約需一小時云、（五日電通電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>擴大婦女救濟東北運動</h3>
<p>— 誠</p>
<p>最近李濟琛夫人王寵惠夫人等鑒於東北義勇軍奮鬥之艱苦。及東北難民遭遇之慘痛。特發起組織中華婦女救濟東北協會。進行援助東北義勇軍與救濟東北難民的工作。在沉寂的婦女界中。得有此一具有重大意義的運動產生。我們不能不認爲一極可欣喜的現象。</p>
<p>東北淪亡已經一年多了。這一年來慘痛的哀號。與悲壯的苦戰。依據於過去的事實而觀察。似乎並沒有在婦女羣衆間激起怎樣大的回響。她們中間。似乎還有若干太太小姐認爲這一切是與自己無關。即使國亡家破。還不妨高唱一　後庭花的艷曲。</p>
<p>寒風起了。尤其是塞外早寒。此時早已成爲冰天雪地。在冰天雪地中。爲了民族的生存。義勇軍正忍着凍·忍着餓·握着冰冷的鐵。出生入死。和强敵作艱苦的鏖戰。而關外難民。國未亡。身先爲奴。也正宛轉呻吟於强敵鐵蹄之下。掙</p>
<p>扎其殘喘。然而若干養尊處優的太太們小姐們。却早已裏在溫煖的呢絨與狐裘裏。準備好了香檳。等待早雪之到來。東北義勇軍的面上所有的只是冰和雪。而若幹太太小姐們面上所有的。則是高貴的巴黎粉和胭脂。東北義勇軍手裏握着的是冰冷的鐵。而若干太太小姐們的手上。則早已戴上了高貴的手套。東北義勇軍日夕以血肉爭生死。而若干太太小姐們則長陶醉於酒紅燈綠的電影場和跳舞場裏。在這兩兩比較之下。這些太太小姐們能不怦然動中嗎。能不爲之慚怍無以自容嗎。</p>
<p>假如我們說中國的人口是四萬萬的話。那末婦女人數。便應該有兩萬萬。集兩萬萬廣大的人羣。而其是號稱太太小姐者。多以搽指抹粉爲生活於國家存亡民族安危。都不一措意。這寗非婦女羣衆的大恥辱。</p>
<p>所以我們認爲這次的婦女界所發起的救濟東北運動是極有意義。我們更認爲此一運動應該加緊擴大。一切的太太小姐們應該省下巴黎粉與胭脂之類的糜費。省下在跳舞場與電影場裏的糜費。省下時新服裝與一切奢侈生活的糜費。拿去捐助東北義勇軍。拿去救濟東北難民。每一個婦女應該有這樣的認識。應該有這樣的决心。</p>
<p>這並不是救他人。即是救我們民族。救我們自己。我們同是中華民國的國民便都應該分荷一分國民的義務。一切的太太小姐們。快快從奢糜安逸的生活覺悟過來啊。</p>

<h3>〓飢饉行人抵京請願〓</h3>
<p>以搗毀國會作威嚇</p>
<p>流血慘劇將重演歟</p>
<p>路透社四日華盛頓電　失業請願團第一批約一千人、已於今日下午分乘汽車抵此、當彼等到達時、即有警察一隊約一百五十人出迎、將彼等導往鐵路附近之林內暫駐、該地事先已用繩圈好、警察等將請願團人員一律騙入圈地、不准外出、請願團人員雖饑寒交迫、仍高唱國際歌、而彼等首領名彭奇明者、復對警察及新聞記者作憤慨之演說、略稱、吾等將搗毀國會、吾等將用武力衝入議場、若彼等不接受吾等之要求、吾等即將暴動、若胡佛調用軍隊、流血之事勢將難免云云、此次請願團頗有組織、並備有若干現金云、此外有請願團約　千五百人、已被瑪利蘭州古柏蘭城之「市民軍」逐出、緣該地之請願團、因缺乏食品及住所、引起內訌、向彼等之首領進攻、於是該城之「市民軍」將全部請願團逐出、引入一六畝大之田園內露宿、在該圈內有六間房之農屋一所、現用爲請願團內之婦孺住所云、</p>
<p>國民社四日華盛頓電　飢民請願隊與怨望農民今日同時入京、準備向國會請願、農民代表暫寓空貨棧及友人家內、飢民請願隊則先游行街衢、入暮大多數寄宿於美格士營房、該營房係當道撥給居住、但以謹守秩序爲條件、否則將加驅逐、其人數尙難估計、據在營房前民團操場巡邏之警察聲稱、至少有二千五百人、並有婦女數名、此外尙有在鬧市賃居廉價小客棧與宿舍、預備明日加入游行隊、警務總監方勸請願隊領袖明日俟推代表數人晋見兩院議長、遞呈請願之要求、但迄今尙未商妥、農民代表則尙無意作示威行動、僅欲在京組織全國農民救濟會議、商定决議案送往國會、若輩皆係各地農民團體正式推舉之代表、內有數人即係今夏加入停糶運動者、但若輩對於飢民請願隊表示同情、</p>
<p>國民社四日華盛頓電　今日有飢民請願隊三隊將抵美京、一自南方、一自北方、一自西方、正向京城進發、聞皆秩序井然、但當道頗慮發生意外事故、已分警察爲三隊、預備分頭彈壓、預防國會開幕日發生紛擾、第今日已有一部份官吏主張准其入京、推派代表至國會請願救濟失業、惟將厲行管理結隊游行條例、倘飢民請願隊决意欲游行過國會前、必將派大隊武裝隊伍監護彈壓、警察總監白朗服務警察已四十年、深信所部警力足以應付事變、時局不足憂慮、渠業有大規模戒備、防範發生紛擾云、</p>
<h3>〓墨國饑民亦起紛擾〓</h3>
<p>國民社四日佛拉克魯茲電　墨西哥今日亦有飢民請願隊、人數更比美國多一倍、今日淸晨有飢民男婦五千餘人步行至本州省會、紛紛鬧鬧、欲入州長署、嗣爲警察逮捕六十餘人、</p>
<h3>〓美對戰債有讓步意〓</h3>
<p>路透社四日紐約電　據紐約報紙華盛頓訪電稱、美當道現考慮便利英國償付十二月十五日到期償欵之可能性、據美京來電、重要銀行家已勸政府依允緩付之請、胡佛總統財長米爾斯國務卿史汀生今日會商終日、擬覓一方法、以避免十二月十五日之危局、</p>
<p>路透社四日華盛頓電　美國批評英法政府關於緩付戰債之覆文、以歐洲軍費爲其攻擊之集中點、前在威爾遜總統政府中任國務員之戈爾壁氏、今日發　建議、謂戰債宜用國際債券償付之、而此債券須由債務國依軍費之比例、担保發行云、衆議院通幣委員會主席索麥士主張利用戰債問題、以增高銀價、謂美國不妨用銀償付十二月期債欵、庶有以解决將來之市况凋敝云、</p>
<h3>〓第一都會居然鬧窮〓</h3>
<p>紐約經費無着</p>
<p>警察欠餉堪虞</p>
<p>國民社四日紐約電　紐約城爲世界最富之都市、乃照目前情形、本月十五日市政府職員及警察夫役等薪俸、竟有無欵撥付之勢、或將出於欠俸、因各銀行以市庫負債已重、苟非市政府大减政費、不允貸欵、代理市長麥克基雖已開始减政、並提减政法案於州議會、惟法案尙未通過、而銀行對於墊欵亦在躊躇之中、當道則深恐欠餉之後、警察將如芝加哥市欠餉後之紀律廢弛、頗爲焦急、</p>
<h3>〓菲島召集特別議會〓</h3>
<p>稅則法案將加修正</p>
<p>國民社五日馬尼剌電　菲島總督下令召集立法議會特別會議、糾正上次通過諸立法案內之謬誤、尤以稅則法爲主、因上次怱怱通過、於總稅則表內多錯誤牵纒、如棉花稅竟至完全忘列、</p>
<h3>軍縮談判前途黯澹</h3>
<p>法對德均等要求堅不讓步</p>
<p>麥唐納竭力斡旋毫無結果</p>
<p>國際軍縮會議勢將無期休會</p>
<p>草約縱能成立並無價値可言</p>
<p>國民社四日日內瓦電　國聯方面對於軍縮問題之前途、今已愈益悲觀、因據秘密漏出之消息、英首相與法總理二人之談話、已屬毫無結果、因法國方面對於德國所要求之軍備均等、絲毫不允讓步、而英首相雖舌敝唇焦、亦無補於事實、並聞英首相曾謂「耶穌誕節即在目前、世上一切人羣皆應忘其仇恨、而從事於友善之增進、故　國之當局亦應從速採取勇敢遠大之計劃云云、統觀目前局勢、德外長牛賴資雖已自柏林前赴日內瓦、但星期一日舉行之五國會議、恐亦難有圓滿之結局也、復憑此處一般觀察家之言、會議之前途已屬萬分無望、所可注意者、即國聯方面究將何以善後、此後軍縮會議是否即將無期休會、抑將按照美國之建議將此會議所已成就之些微效果、先訂立一草約、但此草約即能成立、而其價値實亦等於零也、</p>
<p>國民社四日巴黎電　據日內瓦消息、軍縮會議恐將無期延會、以掩飾其完全失敗、而此間政界因此表示嚴厲之抗議、謂赫禮歐仍將堅主軍縮會議應討論法國之軍縮安全計劃、縱德國不復返會、亦在所不恤、赫氏並將竭力反對英相麥唐納軍縮會議之存亡、以德國是否復返爲轉移之見解、意代表亦與英相同　今獨恐赫氏拒絕對德作何讓步、而堅主均等地位問題須俟會議結局後始能提及、不得以此爲參加會議之條件、果爾則將使會議受一致命之打擊、</p>
<h3>台維斯積極活動</h3>
<p>路透四日日內瓦電　在歐參加軍縮會與世界經濟會之美代表台維斯、現極活動、以推進等於軍縮會休會之美國提議、美國主張凡各方面所可同意之原則、應列入一文中、而於十二月十五日以前簽定之、凡化學與黴菌戰爭之廢除、大砲與坦克車之限制、及無防城鎭大空轟擊之禁止、皆須載入、此爲臨時公約、而輔以永遠監察委員會、該委會應於本月十五日集議、而於下屆耶穌復活節以前完成其工作、此臨時公約將爲軍縮之第一階段、在一九三七年四月以前、爲有效時期、庶與華盛頓海軍公約同時期滿、監察委員會將籌議軍縮之第二階級、而繕成一種協定文、包括美國全部提案、承認德國軍備平等、亦載有關於實施軍備平等之限制、以上爲美國之主張、雖美國提議中、未有以軍縮換取戰債讓與權之表示、但有可注意者、台維斯極欲將此要件、在十二月十五日以前簽定、</p>
<p>查十二月十五日、乃戰債到期之日、其意殆欲使極不滿於歐洲在軍備上費用極钜之美國會議員、稍　緩其對於戰債之態度也、法總理赫禮歐定星期二日由日內瓦返巴黎、似法總理與星期一日可到此之德外長牛賴資、未必能商定其懸案也、</p>
<h3>法德懸案難妥協</h3>
<p>國民社四日柏林電　德外長牛賴資今晚啓程赴日內瓦、出席五國會議、惟柏林政界對該會希望極微因法國尙無準備放棄其不願德國平等觀念之表示、</p>
<h3>日本提示新計劃</h3>
<p>（東京）日軍縮代表爪野全權、四日在日內瓦對英·美·法·意·等國代表、提出日本軍縮案、其內容如下、㈠今次會議、不能爲華盛頓及倫敦條約束縛、㈡縮少軍備以現在勢力爲標準、㈢縮少攻擊的艦種爲主、此辦法使日本犧牲多、諸國犧·</p>
<p>牲少、故主力艦每艘噸數减至二萬五千噸、備砲口徑减至十四英寸、㈣主力艦及備砲入英寸之巡洋艦、日本對美比率須在七成以上、㈤日本贊成全廢航空母艦或縮少其噸數、㈥日本反對全廢潛水艦、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯五日日內瓦電　軍縮大會日本代表向華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約簽字國正式通知日本海軍軍縮提議方綱要、其要點凡四、即㈠主力艦之單一噸數、自三萬五千噸減爲二萬五千噸、㈡禁止航空母艦或減縮其噸數、㈢巡洋艦所裝大砲、保留八吋口徑、㈣保留潛水艇、</p>
<h3>意添造新艦兩艘</h3>
<p>路透四日羅馬電　此間對外傳墨索里尼因法國繼續進行新巡洋艦「鄧克」號之建築、表示不滿、故下令增造七千噸級巡洋艦兩艘之說、已堅决否認、據官方消息、法國繼續造艦、固令意政府不滿、但意國之增造巡洋艦兩艘、實係意國造艦計畫之一部、用以代替舊艦者、並非對法而　云、聞兩新意艦均備有六寸口徑砲云、</p>
<h3>滿案戰債軍縮形成連鎖關係</h3>
<p>俄報指美國藉戰債問題</p>
<p>欲擊破英法日外交結合</p>
<p>塔斯社四日莫斯科電　此間「眞理報」今日著文、論英法第二次致美之戰債照會、指戰債非一經濟問題、而爲政治問題、因美國欲假此施壓力於其競爭者、以擊破英法日之外交結合也、該報稱、英照會所述「一九二三年至二九年之經濟繁榮爲幻象的」之說、爲頗準確　謂戰債之重付、足使歐洲國家之財政及商業受一打擊、而加甚市場爭奪、影響鎊價跌落·物價　貴·工資减削·及英國內部不安之加增、惟在此照會中、英帝國除承認其本身之弱點外、同時極少掩飾的威晉美國、謂對英經濟之任何打擊、均足直接影響於美國經濟、在此一點、顯示英國照會發出之前唐寗街與蓋達賽必已先有接洽、故英法照會所舉理由雖不同、在外交上此僅形式之不同而已　再則其不舉同樣理由、亦以避免引起美國債權人以「歐洲共同戰線」之恐懼、惟歐洲確未有共同戰線、蓋德意現均各行其路也、該報最後謂列强之對立現益尖銳化、目前戰債軍縮與滿案等問題、均有密切之聯鎖性、而不能單獨求得解决云、</p>

<h3>德新內閣緩和國會政策</h3>
<p>擬取銷某項代律令</p>
<p>藉博國社黨之歡心</p>
<p>路透四日柏林電　德國會定星期二日開會、施萊轍內閣已迅速集合、討論如何應付國會問題、如好事之各黨能免作不信任之投票、則新政府之未來政策、似將延至取誕節後發表、豫料施萊轍將表示早日取銷最近總統因防杜騷亂所下命令中之某項社會與政治計劃、先博社會民主黨或國社黨之數心、</p>
<p>路透四日柯洛業電　國社黨員約二百人、穿着制服、整隊行於杜斯堡鎭之郊外、與一隊共和黨員相値、雙方人數相埒、致起衝突、彼此揮杖相打、並放手槍若干響、重傷十三人、輕傷者甚多、幸無一殞命、</p>
<h3>日驅逐艦「早蕨」在暴風巨浪包圍中</h3>
<p>▲電通社五日東京電　海軍省公布、據馬公要港部司令官來電稱、由吳軍港向馬公要港部回航中之驅逐艦「早蕨」、於五日下午二時、在台灣北端寶貴角之北、約百英里之海上因遇暴風橫浪在飄流中、同航中之三艦、乃冒浪施救、迄下午五時遇救者十四名、馬公要港部當急派巡洋艦「北上」「五十鈴」二隻前往援救、目下正在銳　救助中、該「早蕨」係大正十年十二月在川畸造船所建造、大正十一年九月行進水禮、主砲爲十二珊三、速率爲三十一半、排水重九百噸云、</p>
<h3>日政府臨議會之難關</h3>
<p>國同以反對黨立場準備猛攻</p>
<p>貴院頗重視司法官赤化事件</p>
<p>▲華聯社五日東京電　日國會定十二月二十四日召集、二十六日舉開院式曲禮、政友會·民政黨及國民同盟、皆每日開領袖會議、討論對付策略、國同已决定站在反對黨立場、採進攻策、民政黨决擁護政府、惟政友會徬徨未定、上院各派則以左列五大問題攻擊政府、其中特別注意司法官參加共產黨問題、所謂五項爲㈠對破產豫算整理問題、㈡匯兌對付策及管理貿易、㈢軍事費繼續財源、㈣對滿政策及對國聯政策、㈤司法官尾崎與坂本兩人參加共產黨運動謀覆日本團體之責任誰屬問題等、</p>
<p>▲電通社五日東京電　國民同盟定二十二日在日比谷公會堂舉行結黨式、二十三日即開結黨後最初之議員會、整備陣容、以應付第六十四議會、聞該黨方針雖係少數黨、將以純野黨的立場、採獨自之態度、爲全部之活動、即來年度豫算羅列龐大之數字而已、時局匡救亦違反臨時議會之聲明、因匯市慘跌膨脹政策、使物價　貴、國民生活、招致未曾有之不安、政府雖稱將整理財政稅制、以償此等缺陷、然謂僅整理財政稅制、能除去此等根本的不安、未免太愚、窺政府之意、不過</p>
<p>欲藉此度過議會難關而已、至於思想方面、亦爲空前之重大問題、有現任判事之□□□事件關係問題、一面對滿政策與外交方面、舉國對現政府均有要求、要之如斯　局、非僅財政行政之技術化等表面手段、所能打開匡救、實有待於政治的經濟的根本改革云、此爲國民同盟抱之態度、從此見地、遇有機會即對政府予以痛擊、他面對政友民政兩黨之態度、與以　甚之注意、而謀應變之策戰、</p>
<p>▲電通社五日東京電　今日上午小山法相往謁齊藤首相、討論「滿洲國」招聘日本司法官事、且懇談司法省所生之不祥事件之責任問題、小山氏以爲法相所應執之處置、當不容責任、然事件之全狀、尙未見究則態度之决定、似屬尙早、且謂即充分調查後再决定態度、亦覺不遲云、齊藤首相亦深諒之、</p>
<h3>特羅資基潛返巴黎</h3>
<p>▲國民社中日巴黎電　特羅資基改名塞杜夫、偕其夫人及秘書三人、今日乘丹船行抵登扣克、即乘火車來此、警察今復嚴加防範反對特氏者作示威行動、特氏此次赴丹、原擬久居、故曾與其夫人在丹京鄉間覓得一厦、如丹政府能予允可、即擬購以爲居、但卒遭拒絕、聞恐觸犯蘇俄政府之故、特氏之欲遷居丹國、表面雖稱乃因著作欲參考丹京著名圖書館、其實欲與俄國事務之發展接觸較便耳、預料特氏今將直返斯坦波爾（前居士但丁）云、</p>
<h3>日兵屍身絡繹運回</h3>
<p>▲華聯社五日東京電　日報連日報告在東三省作戰如何順利、安頓國內民心、但運屍兵船、依然絡繹不絕、昨日又有陣亡士兵屍身二百二十四具運到門司、分送各所屬部隊安葬、</p>
<h3>滿洲問題與聯盟各國代表（）</h3>
<p>西班牙代表馬德利亞·　捷克斯拉夫代表度尼秀二人、罵小國中反日之　先鋒、馬氏現年四十六歲初從事於鐵道事業、後充倫敦文藝評論主筆、十年前任聯盟事務局新聞部部員·軍縮部長·及管理軍需品貿易之國際會議理事長勇敢精敏、貢獻軍縮事業　功甚大、一九三一年四月、任西班牙共和國最初之駐美大使、現任駐法大使、彼精通英法數國語言、舌鋒銳利、此次理事會開會時、還對日辯駁、異常强硬、故日人深惡之、呼之爲「鼠之頭」、皮尼秀氏爲歐洲著名之外交官、並爲經濟學家、自一九二八年捷克共和國成立以來、任外相至今、對於大戰後所發生之歐洲所有事件、與一切大小問題、無不洞悉、渠與大總統馬薩力克博士、在歐洲以明幹　達著稱、現年四十八歲、渠之生平主張、傾力於歐洲平和機關之完成、惟渠接近法國、蓋欲維持中歐之和平組織、不得不與法國提携也、一方則拉攏英法兩國聯合、以維持歐洲之政治經濟利益、苟英法兩國發生爭執、皮氏卽出而調停之、故爲英法當道所信任、自一九二三年後、渠率領諸小國、努力運動歐洲之和平、前月二十五日開理事會時、皮氏即主張將滿洲問題之全部、以單純審議進行方法、付託於特別大會、並留保在大會申述意見之權利、各國代表、一聞其言、英不欣然贊同、而日本反對移交大會之主張、至此完全失敗、此不得不謂皮氏素得各國之信任有以致之也、</p>

<h3>日捕金澈含意叵測</h3>
<p>▲因審詢時異常注意中韓關係</p>
<p>▲金離滬養病委吳凱聲辦交涉</p>
<p>新聲社云、日方派人闖入法租界擅自捕人案、經市政府向法日丙領署提出抗議後、現雙方均在攷盧中、惟日方此資助擅捕金永鐸、尙含有其他用意、現金因養傷已離滬、一切交涉事宜、均委託吳凱聲律師辦理、其日前被捕時、由日方沒收之財物、則已由蔡曉白律師、於昨日函法領、請向日方追索、茲分誌詳情於次、</p>
<p>金澈金哲離滬　金澈自法領署釋出後、即寓東新橋大滬飯店六樓六百零六號、化名廖某、請紅十字會某名醫診治、手足被捆受傷、未復原狀、背後左脇、被毆靑腫、前胸亦紅腫、據醫生檢查、謂肺部受傷、由於掙扎被猛擊之故、鼻右受擦傷一處、後腦有擊傷三處、手足麻木、尙難握管、頭梳半分式、髪被扯去數處、有血跡、至四日上午八時半、由華人某君、以汽車送赴南翔、其子金哲同往、金哲因與日探互擊之故、頭部手足及全身受傷五十餘處、口被日探以毛巾堵塞數次、皮破血流、飲食入口頗難、據醫生言尙不致有性命危險云、</p>
<p>日人捕金用意　金之友人於送金出發後、即於昨日奉金之委託　來訪晤記者、談當時日方於審詢金永鐸之時、語氣中實含有其他用意、據云、其主要有關係各點、略舉如下㈠詢金當担任韓國革命黨財政部長時、其財政之來源、由何而來、由中國何機關及何人得來、及韓國何地何人寄來、㈡韓革命黨之軍事、其軍備組織如何、軍餉來源與軍火之供應、中國由何人何機關接濟、數目若干、㈢在上海所交接之中國人爲何人、上海韓革命黨機關、及其重要人等何人、此外尙有其他事項頗多、惟均未涉及「中國等字樣」、金均答以幷無其事、以此被毆云、</p>
<p>追索沒收財物　法日兩領署、對市政府之抗議、現悉收到後尙未有正式答復、雙方均正在研究中、惟金之代表律師蔡曉白、對金之財物被日人沒收、以爲太不合情理、已於昨日下午三時、以代表名議、致函法領署、要求轉向日方追索此項財物、該函內容、大致謂、金永鐸被日方綁架、經貴領署交涉釋放後、本律師代表金永鐸表示謝意、惟金於被捕時、身邊帶有鈔洋五百六十元及金錶自來水筆圖章以及呢大衣等件、除已呈請市政府交涉外、特再依照應有手續、函貴總領事、轉向日方、追索此項財物云、</p>
<p>黃展英之歷史　此次金之被捕完全由於漢奸黃展英之作崇、黃爲廣東台山縣人、年約卅餘歲、曾隨中委李烈鈞多年、又在伍澄宇律師事務所任事甚久、對於粵籍革命黨人、多有關係、此次與金澈相識、亦爲粵籍某君所介紹、不料彼竟爲此賣國賣友之事、於金澈被綁之後、捕房即在黃寓搜查、除木器枕被而外、所有名片字據衣箱等件、均早推携出、可見其蓄意之深、黃今夏曾在霞飛路上海銀行對面租樓一所、居住數月、即由此處遷至　維靄路如意里二號、設此機關云、</p>
<p>聘吳凱聲律師　金澈被捕之後、曾由某君介紹吳凱聲律師事務所蔡曉白律師辦理此案、茲因此案、關係中法兩國法權甚大、復由某君介紹吳律師辦理是案　據吳律師談話、略謂、此次日警非法逮捕華籍韓僑金永鐸、由本律師事務所律師蔡曉白辦理、賴市政府與法總領事依法抗爭、獲得圓滿結果、國人多感激欣慰、查日人自逮捕政治犯安昌浩後、此爲第二次之非法行動、影響於法租界居民之安全甚大、深願法租界向日方嚴重交涉、不致以後再發生此項類同事件、惟以此案法律上觀點、仍須說明者、查金永鐸已於民國十八年十月取得中國籍居住於中國領域內之法租界、縱有犯罪嫌疑、依照現行條約、日領可要求法領送交特區法院辦理、即認該金永鐸仍有日本國籍存在、亦祇得要求法領引渡、倘經查明、已取得中國籍、或係政治犯、法領均可拒絕引渡、日警絕無自行逮捕之理、日本號稱文明國家、動輒越軌殊多遺憾云云、</p>

<p>王沙葩君訊　夫婦愛情之所以降落，有下列數因：㈠環境關係：㈡外遇：㈢細微事情的齟齬；㈣喜新厭舊的心理，而尤以第一點爲其大因。補救之法，屬於第一因的，應該「安命守分」，而屬於其他三因的，則應以「相敬相愛始終如一」八個大字去補救。</p>
<p>陳曾屏君訊　第㈠是因爲他們的思想不健全，對於戀愛的眞諦沒有認識，只知享受愛情的甜味，而沒有想到應盡的義務，所以一旦結合，便感到所負責任的煩重。第㈡（甲）應愼於始初，雙方須深切互相了解；（乙）回味過去恩愛的瑣事，並在無意中作爲談話的資料，以引起舊情的復活，切不可意氣用爭，致成僵局。</p>
<p>李醒君訊　第㈠因爲相愛之始，彼此都隱藏其本性，互相遷就以達到其最終之目的。迨同居旣久，各露出本來面目，且天下事已大定，不必遷就，於是愛情冷落，悲劇開始。第㈡補救之道：（一）各能相諒，俾「大事化小，小事化無」，上策也，（二）男女各找尋一相當職業，各寄其精神於職業之中，以減少家庭間之衝突，中策也；（三）常作小別離，下策也。</p>
<p>劉新民君訊　第㈠由於「結婚是愛情的墳墓」的心理，女子在經濟方面不能獨立，也是一個大原因。第㈡補救之道，（一）女子在經濟方面須力求獨立，（二）家庭方面，男女須共同負擔。　　黃麗苑君訊　第㈠由於始初沒有經過長期的考慮，沒有注意對方的學職和性情，第㈡夫婦之間平時須相敬相愛，彼此都以眞心對待，妻善理家務，丈夫在外面亦不浪費，不揮霍。萬一發生意見，彼此互相原諒一點。</p>
<p>㈡楊勛君訊　廿一、十二、四</p>
<p>我這裏有一個想了許多時候而不能解决的問題，請求作一吻合事實底解答。　　這問題便是：</p>
<p>「假使做一件事只有兩種方法：一種是違背良心而有利的；一種是不違背良心而有害的；那末照那一種方法實行？」</p>
<p>恐怕不懂這問題的意思，所以我在下面舉了一個事實上的例子：</p>
<p>「王老五是一家專販賣×貨的店鋪的主人，自從九一八以後，他心上覺得假使再賣×貨，實在於心有愧，但是，待欲不賣，那末店鋪中的許多存貨勢必不能出脫，現金當然不能得到，然而年關近了，××洋行的貨欵是不能不付淸的！股東的股息是無論如何要照給的，還有日常的開支………那末，倒底怎樣好呢，繼續賣呢？還是不賣而宣告破產呢？</p>
<p>這問題就止於此，請先生也照我的方法，在報端給我一個事實上的解答！覆：來函所提問題太籠統，不便作答，現在只就所舉實事解答如下：王老爹販賣×貨，誠然是於已有利，但只利在「個人」，至多亦不過利及「一家」。然而在另一方面呢，却害了我們整個的國家，整個的民族，因爲王老五販賣×貨，直接旣使我國經濟蒙受打擊，間接又使××人得將賺自我國的錢製成槍砲去打東北的義勇軍。究竟是一個人或一家人的利益重要呢？還是一民族的利益重要呢？我想這問題大槪無論是誰都可以解答罷，何况這裏的事實是利在一家，而害則在一國呢？</p>
<p>×井洋行的貨欵須付淸。東北的血賬不該償還嗎？王老五一家的生活須開支，東北義勇軍和東北難民不該有生活的開支嗎？在塞外冰天雪地裏，義軍正在爲維護我民族的生存作艱難的搏鬥，而王老五却安然坐在家里販賣×貨，爲敵人關財源，則彼實已鹿豕之不如，那裏還談得到「良心」呢？</p>
<p>假如不將「個人利益重呢」？還是「民族利益重呢」？這一問題體認明白，則豈僅×貨可販？溥儀鄭孝胥之流又何嘗不是呌做「人」呢？</p>

<h3>九個月來敎育部整理全國敎育之說明（一）</h3>
<p>㈠總論</p>
<p>齊家驊自膺重命、承乏敎政、九閱月來、恪遵中央意旨、與在事同仁、競競業業、共求繼續前賢、努力䇿進、其有成規舊制、皆前賢擘劃經營、非至歷經實施確有弊害者、不敢輕易有所更張、故凡所興革、均事事慎重、集思廣益、期其利多害少切實易行、但在此興革之可能範圍內、家驊與在事同仁、仍持有一贯之趋向、鍥而不舍、求其實現、趨向維何、卽注重民族復興以厲行整理與改進全國敎育是也、謹案中華民國敎育宗旨、業奉中央確定、但欲貫澈此宗旨、使全國敎育遵此宗旨而得有改進、則因時制宜之切實辦法、必須繼敎育宗旨而加以採行、否則敎育宗旨縱已確定、亦難望　益於實際、窮謂中國現在就整個民族言、必須在敎育上注重民族復興、而後中國民族乃能自由、就敎育本身言、必須在步　上厲行整理而後敎育乃能見宏效、中國民族復興必須有待於敎育者有二、一爲養成國民之民族觀念、一爲恢復國民之民族自信、總理嘗謂把世界文化迎頭趕上去、把中國民族從根救起來、又謂復興中國民族必須促成民族團結、恢復民族自信、此兩遺敎、實有一貫意義、中國必須迎頭趕上世界文化、但趕上世界文化必先救起中國民族、救起中國民族又必先促成民族團結、恢復民族自信、蓋中國社會缺乏組織、缺乏紀律、已無可諱言、個人自由旣視爲素常、則一切團體要素、乃極端缺乏、結果民族如一盤散沙、喪失其團結進取之精神、此在敎育上非以民族觀念之培養爲其主要內容、實無從救正、又中國年來因西洋文化迅速輪入、不暇作審愼之抉擇、於是紛於抄襲、亂於追隨、終至無論任何制度文物思想學理、一至中國、卽成爲逾淮之橘、此皆由於失其民族自信所致、國民旣忘其民族之固有文化、對於外來文化之吸收、自失其自主、對於新文化之創造、尤缺其基礎、文化必須創造、而創造必須以固有文化爲其基礎、失此基礎、則世界</p>
<p>文化融會無自、迎頭趕上更談不到、此在敎育上又非以民族自信之培養爲其主要內容、亦無從救正、此改進全國敎育應注重民族復興之旨趣也、今日全國敎育、其發展關係失其均衡、而其實際內容復流於空虛、高等敎育苦於浮濫而初等敎育尙艱於推廣、文法科敎育苦於駢設而實科敎育尙艱於發展、中學日事推廣而職業與師資之訓練反形　如、學校集於城市而缺於鄉村、此全國敎育發展關係之失其均衡也、各級學校專事鋪張、開支浪費、紛設課程而不重其基本、缺乏設備而不求其充實、敎學不良、致學生程度日低、訓育不良、致學校風紀日　、此全國敎育實際內容流於空虛也、此兩種現象又復互爲惡因、於是內容愈空虛、發展愈迅速、終至整個敎育、成爲浪費混亂之局面、欲返此積重、惟有厲行整理、調節其發展、使有緩急先後、充實其內容、使能切實有效、否則任其內容缺乏、發展畸形、不加糾正、則發展多一事、卽在整個敎育上多增一重錯誤、發展愈多、錯誤愈大、而受毒亦愈深也、凡此要點實爲本部對全國敎育改進之根本趨向、本部自本年二月以來、凡所設施、或有已在陸續實行者、或有尙在分別籌劃者、卽皆持此旨以爲取舍標準、謹分陳之、</p>
<p>㈡推行義務敎育與改進小學敎育</p>
<p>建築民族下層基礎在於普及敎育、義務敎育與小學敎育均爲普及敎育之要圖、任何國家　如欲謀敎育普及、必須推廣小學敎育使成義務敎育、但中國小學敎育辦理未善、而社會經濟、地方財政、又極枯窘、義務敎育與小學敎育、乃不能併爲一事　故必一而謀小學敎育之充分改進、一面求義務敎育之普遍推行、改進小學敎育、本部業已改訂小學組織法及小學規程、小學規程中關於地方敎育之研究、小學之編制、經費之支配、設備之充實、訓育之改革　敎職員之待遇進修、均爲嚴密之規定、尤於課程一事、已頒佈詳細標準、特別注重、以期現有各小學遵此種種規定、以科學方法充實內容、至於義務敎育、本部曾頒佈第一期實施義務敎育辦法大綱及短期義務敎育實施辦法大綱、第一期實施義務敎育辦法、係規定初級小學爲義務敎育、以期分年分區、先之以實騐、繼之以推行、使將來初級小學、普遍設置、成爲義務敎育、蓋現在中國十歲至十六歲之年長失學兒童、爲數達三千餘萬、如欲一律使受四年初級小學之義務敎育、則不特年需三萬萬元之經費無從籌措、卽一百四十萬之小學敎員、亦非倉卒間所能訓練完成、故非分年分</p>
<p>區、實騐推行、漸求遍設不可、但僅此辦法、决不足以應急、故復以短期義務敎育實施辦法、爲钜數失學兒童作急切之救濟、此項辦法、係將義務敎育年限、縮短爲一年之短期小學、純採分班制、使十歲至十六歲之年長失學兒童卽忙於作工務農者、亦得抽暇求學、其課程一以識字爲目的、祇設國語一種包括常識數算、使其特別簡易、故第一期實施義務敎育辦法、定義務敎育爲四年、乃所以期其逐淅推行、便於提高至六年然後再提高至六年以上、以示永久之圖、而短期義務敎育辦法、暫定一年爲短期義務敎育、乃所以期其普遍設置、便於實行强迫、以應暫時之急、蓋今日全國失學者爲數過钜、國事日　、義務敎育之推行、决不能任其從容延緩、逐次推行而不另作急切之補救也、</p>

<p>棉市以美棉又落、印度棉跌風益　、市氣又現衰弱之狀、後以各路到貨欠缺、場中新拋戶未多、且漢埠天津濟南鄭州等處、市價難以　下、所以海外跌風雖起、本棉目前尙昂、然金融緊急、紗市日疲、各廠亦無大量搜羅之念、故大勢不脫盤旋之局、</p>

<h3>外棉一致下墜</h3>

<h3>印棉日銷尙暢</h3>
<p>│銀價跌落利於出口│</p>
<p>（孟買）上週印美間之差價愈巨、出口之佳、由於銀價跌落所致、日商購買期棉、內以奧姆辣爲多、印美差價之能維持、日商購買爲主因、除日本外、印棉之需要極微、本地廠胃亦淡、天氯不定、但利於奧姆辣、新棉到貨、因印金運美而遲延、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>利物浦）上週現需不動、期貨因政局關係及埃及棉不振而　、多頭了結及套　之額、同業不能盡量吸收、故雖在銀價低落之中、僅能維持現狀、埃及棉因美棉及亞　山消息不佳而軟、</p>
<h3>糧食米市漲起一角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、因有風雨不多、約祇三十餘號、浦存亦厚、連日津帮包子採辦二千包、形勢向上、　稻早稻北粳統提角許、　洋尖到銷二平、市無升沈、陰化來貨雖稀酒戶不爽、價格定局、</p>
<p>（新關）昨日西路來源不多、約念五六號、早晨小雨做開有限、常錫北粳及江陰米喊起角外、薄稻　胃略動、跟起五分河下斛開近千石、</p>
<h3>客秈將供過於求</h3>
<p>│到頭逐漸旺…閩帮胃口不懈│</p>
<p>│杜米北化後…洋米或有生機│</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况活潑到銷亦旺暢市面似可步我熱鬧途中、但到貨多於銷數行情乃有步下之趨勢、昨日新到皖　湘三省客元客秈約五千包左右去化只有半數、故市氣雖佳、價則回小一角左右、客元被河下新貨及江西機元存到兩充之影響、尤見遜色、蕪機元日前曾售開十元零七角半及十一元之钜、上週尙開十元之價昨日竟小至九元以內、較小角半、安慶機元貨品較次尤爲不振、統市售開蕪機元七百七十包價九元九角至八角半、安慶機元二百七十包價八元二角半至二角、江西　晚一百五十包、價八元三角半、湖南　靖一千包、價七元三角九分至二角半　湖南砶紅米三百包、價七元至六元九角　其中江西機晚由閩省泉州幫辦去外、其餘均係閩省幫辦去　閩幫胃品尙濃　此後尙有繼續暢辦之必要、惟北洋帮因本省及浙路之杜粳有出口可能　眼光一致移换　此后客秈之北化　恐将绝跡、客秈到头逐旺、去路只恃闽帮一路、后形殊有杞愛也、惟杜粳北化後　洋米本街銷路、又有一線生機云</p>
<h3>標粉徘徊中帶軟勢</h3>
<p>│海岸麥聞大廠又定成兩船│</p>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後　各月份市面、呈初疲繼穩之態、以洋麥報價　會又小一角左右　故開價時、市氣不佳　近期會低去五厘左右、旋因廠拋不動、外行人心尙佳　故復呈穩象　迨至下午開盤各月份盤旋之中、已帶軟勢　因津帮續有回出、澳州洋麥　近又活動聞大廠又定成二船、價三兩五錢至三兩五錢三四分不等、信大已新到洋麥三千餘噸　似乎現貨之生產、已能　豐　所以各盤市氣　漸呈不振、此後之升沉、須看實銷如何、再定究竟也、結果本月份不動、一二月份跌二厘半、三四五月份跌五釐云、</p>
<h3>期麥觀望不前</h3>
<p>│不久將來洋麥大批進口│</p>
<p>│本麥立場不免爲之搖動│</p>
<p>昨期麥市面　止下午開盤後　各月份又趨盤旋之態、以洋麥報價、上落無幾、買賣雙方　觀望不前　上午各盤　交易異常稀少、下午稍形熱鬧、二三月份初見堅定　傳因洋麥又有成交、回落二分、四月份交易甚少、市趨穩立、觀不久洋麥將大批進口　本麥立場　不免爲所搖動矣、結果祇四月份較好一分、餘無比較云、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥多頭了結</h3>

<h3>糖市　國產靑糖成交尙多</h3>
<p>昨糖市以標金轉跌　趨勢已見平定　公會劃盤二十四號粗砂白普通貨初划十五兩六錢　後降至五錢七分半、成交數百包、高貸十五兩七錢二十號中砂白十四兩八錢　十八號中砂白十四兩半、無甚上落、荷赤市勢仍緊　　貨八號爲十一兩六錢半至七錢　九號十一兩八錢　十號十一兩九錢　廣帮號家開出次片靑九百件、價爲八兩包　價爲十五兩三錢半、汕頭號家　昨兩日開出棉湖赤千餘包　價爲十一兩　次至十兩零六錢建帮號家開出高統手冰數十箱　每砠價爲十兩零二錢、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>珍眉綠茶法銷略動</p>
<p>昨日路荘·土荘等路之珍眉綠茶、法銷略活、惟做開市盤、屯溪貨開至七十兩關內　溫州玉山等路貨開至卅一二兩、比前又跌二三兩、至　源工色貨、俏路蕪甚進展、貢熙一項、高荘與低荘茶、白頭荘謙義裕降等行均有進胃、交易不寂、惟中關貨、因俄荘認盤過苛、並無成交云、</p>

<h3>新婚之夜（五）</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>「有什麼醜，我偏不進去，看你怎麼樣？我又不是偷了漢子，盜了人家的東西，我怕什麼呢？」</p>
<p>眞是出乎姨媽意料之外，想不到秀姑娘會有這大勇氣的。</p>
<p>『不要鬧了，你又不是三五十歲的孩子，女人誰都要嫁呵。』</p>
<p>姨媽的聲音故意低了些。</p>
<p>『哼！爲什麼一定要嫁？自己不會生活嗎？莫說我是終身不嫁的人，即使嫁，我也要嫁自己願意嫁的人，我不能給你們賣掉，哼！賣給比我父親還要老的猴子，媽呀，我怕，我害怕呵！……』</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人越來越多了，姨媽急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻一般沒有辦法，而秀姑娘已氣得快要昏過去了，眼淚早已哭幹，突然間鼻子裏流出很多的鮮血來。</p>
<p>『快拿棉花來！』</p>
<p>『不要緊，是火氣上昇，沒有多大關係。』</p>
<p>『這新娘子一定是性子急的。』</p>
<p>『也怪不得她，人家太可憐了，嫁這麼一個老東西。』</p>
<p>『眞的，而且太醜了！』</p>
<p>『又是個視錢如命的吝嗇鬼。』</p>
<p>『不要說，閉着嘴。』</p>
<p>『干你屁事！』</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>這是由人羣中發出來的嘈雜聲音。</p>
<p>『姨媽呀，感謝你做了一個好媒人，我今天要死在你的面前了！我决不回到那老猴子那裏去，我寗……願死，不，不…不願再看到他的面孔了！</p>
<p>「媽呀！你白白地辛苦了一場，我是至死不屈服要反抗到底的！我的生命不能給你們去賣掉，不能由你們交給人家去宰割，我要自己處理我自己，毀滅我自己……」</p>
<p>嘭的一聲，秀姑娘的頭往壁上一碰，後腦恰恰碰在一個很小的只有五分長的洋釘上面，於是像瀑布一般的鮮血噴了出來，大衆都嚇得怪呌，有的唉聲嘆氣流着同情之淚，也有的摩拳擦掌在窗口邊大寫其：「他媽的死猴子，害死了這麼一個年輕美麗的姑娘！」</p>
<p>秀姑娘的血仍是不斷地流，醫生遠沒有來，她已經暈過去了。</p>
<p>一九三二，十一，廿八下午</p>
<p>「註一」這是湖南新化的方言，凡是處女第一次與異性發生關係，稱爲圓房。</p>
<p>「註二」石女是生理上構造不完全，不能夠與男性發生性的關係的處女。</p>
<p>「註三」形容美麗的女子嫁個醜丈夫的意思。</p>
<p>「註四」這是說年老的男人知道愛惜妻子，而年輕的人却把妻子看得像草一般地不重要。</p>
<h3>關於衣的話</h3>
<p>— 井</p>
<p>近來上澡堂，最怕茶房給我脫衣，因爲我的五年前做的西服，外表雖還像件衣，裏面可破得花花絮絮的，自己看了都覺得難爲情了衣服如此，生活可知；好友T君還來信說我「以無產階級隊伍中摩做海上資產階級的起居」，眞是冤哉枉也！</p>
<p>在社會上混了多年，混到現在，連衣服都不周全，你一定要批評說；「這不是太不成材，便一定是太不努力，决不干社會的事」！這對於我，也許都說得恰當，我願意領受；然而那枝藝精巧的工人，那終日勞苦如牛馬的農人，那拿幾塊錢一個月，甚至於一文也拿不到手以生命換生活的士兵，他們總算是有用的材料，總算是努力的分子，他們的衣服周全嗎？恐怕有一件能禦寒的破衣已經是莫大的慰安了！這你能扳起面孔說，「决不干社會的事」嗎？</p>
<p>或者你要轉口說，「他們的能力太有限了」。然乎？不然！甚麼呌做「能力有限」？那些搜括着民脂民膏，吞沒着公帑公欵的人們，把整批的鈔票存入外國銀行，把雪白的銀洋像流水般的隨手花着，這可以呌做「能力大」麼？還有那承受着大宗遺產的，肩不能挑，手不能提，萬事不　，可是他們冬不愁穿，夏不愁換：這也可以呌做「有能力」麼？社會如此，能說這不干自己的事麼？</p>
<p>假如你依舊咬着嘴說，這與社會無干；那么，我便無話可說，只有怪自己「生不逢辰」，不生而爲富人貴人，或富人之子孫，或貴人之妻妾了！不然，便只怨我「生不逢地」，不生在熱帶，一條單褲，可以一年穿到頭。然而那裏的窮人們，却也有許多連這一條單褲也不能周全的呢！</p>
<h3>搬家</h3>
<p>— 星子</p>
<p>昨天，我又搬家了，半年来，妻常常鬧着搬家，不是說臭虫多，便是說蚊子討厭，於是搬來搬去，搬去了又搬來。</p>
<p>想起來，自己也忍不住要發笑。每當搬家的時候，總是如此這般的對朋友們說：這房子，是多麼壞！臭虫和蚊子，當不住！而新居則是怎樣的好。…這話已不止說一次了，起初朋友們還點點頭，表示同意，現在聽慣了，任我說得怎樣起勁，已不大理會。我想，搬動總是好的，因爲搬家，說得好聽一點，便是喬遷，雖說臭虫蚊子之類並不因我搬家之故而和我絕交，但「出自幽谷，遷於喬木」，這兩句詩，究竟是那麼悅耳而且甜。</p>
<p>談到搬家，我又記起了兩個故事，一個是「孟母三遷，」但我的小女兒，現在還只有四個月，並不如阿軻那樣的頑皮，而且我也並不奢望這世界再來一個亞聖」，則像孟母那樣的搬來搬去，似乎也大可不必。</p>
<p>第二個是古公亶父初居邠，因爲狄人來侵，便舉國遷避於歧山之下，從之者有若歸市，這是浩浩蕩蕩的大搬家，但爲害於小子的，則只有臭虫和蚊子之類，從之者，也只有一個四個月的小女兒，自不敢妄自尊大，儹與比搬，而且這又是「國家大事」，更非小子所也與聞，在此，也大可以一筆撇開！</p>
<p>旣不願比擬孟母，又不敢僭擬古公鹯父·然則，……於是我又記起了故鄉「猴子搬兒」的俗話，好，就算是「猴子搬兒」罷！</p>
<h3>物體由高處下落之偏東</h3>
<p>— 聲</p>
<p>西歷一五四六年至一六○一年間，丹麥天文學者布拉哈氏（TｙｃｈｏBｒａｈａ）否認地球的自轉。他說：『如果地球眞自西向東廻轉，則由高處落下的物體，必落於高點下面稍稍偏西的地點。』伹當時無一人能發見這種落下物體偏西的現象。到後來，於一六七九年，牛頓氏（Nｅｗｔｏｎ）和福克氏（Ｈｏｏｋ）兩人曾互相通信，討論此事。其結果，落下物體不是偏西而是偏東。最初以實驗證明下落物體之東偏的是意大利的物理學者古里歐爾美尼氏（Gｕｇｌｉｅｌｍｉｎｉ）。他於一七九二年，在波羅尼亞洲（Bｏｌｏｇｎａ）之得利亞西尼利（Dｅｇｌｉ　Aｓｉｎｅｌｌｉ）塔上（高二百四十英尺），投下十六個球體，都是落於稍稍偏東的地點。</p>
<p>又德國的物理學者彭曾堡（Bｅｎｚｅｎｂｅｒｇ），於一八○二年，在漢堡的美克利斯敎堂（MｉｃｈａｅｌｉｓCｈｕｒｃｈ），在高三百四十餘英尺的高塔上投下三十一個球體，其中十十一個落於偏東四蘭（Lｉｎｅｓ），即約二分七厘的地點。又次年在斯普洛克黑惠兒（Sｐｒｏｃｋｈｏｓｖｅｌ）附近修列史斯（Ｓｃｈｌｅｓｅｂｕｓｃｈ）的煤坑的豎坑中，作此實驗，　　一八三一年，物理學者萊喜氏（Bｅｉｃｈ）在撒遜慣性州的福來堡（Fｒｅｉｂｅｒｇ），名三弟兄（Dｒｅｉｂｒｕｅｄｅｒ）的豎抗（深約四百八十餘英尺）內，作一百零六次的試驗。各球皆落下於偏東的地點。平均離原位十二蘭又五分之二（約八分二厘）。</p>
<p>由以上各種實驗，故知下落物體之偏東爲無疑的事實了。其願因當然是地球這自轉。</p>
<h3>蘇俄的託兒所</h3>
<p>— 克多</p>
<p>蘇俄自從創造了新體制的政府之後，士一年以來，社會上興起了許許多多的新鮮花樣，現在蘇俄的婦女們生了嬰兒，自己已用不着僱奶媽，或是泡奶粉，洗尿布，祇消把她們生下來初見世面的小娃娃，送到國家設立的託兒所去，自有那些穿白衣，戴白帽的女護士們，保姆們，代他們養育。</p>
<p>託兒所，俄文呌做「耶斯林」Yａｓｌｉｎ，也有人譯爲嬰兒院。在蘇俄現今的都市中，農村中，凡是人民衆多的地方，都設立託兒所。</p>
<p>這種託兒所，或是特別建築房屋，或是附設在工人宿舍中，和大圖書館，遊藝場與俱樂部中，總是以光綫充足，空氣新鮮，照科學的方法，使兒童適合於衛生條件。</p>
<p>大概託兒所的設備，首先進門的地方，有一間細小嬰兒收發室。這間房子。專爲家族接送嬰兒時休息用的。當家長送嬰兒到所以後，先將嬰兒交給看護，她就把嬰兒穿來的衣服，脫得寸絲不留，將衣服放在一個高約四尺，長約五六尺的衣櫥內。這個小衣櫥，分成了許多小格，在每格內又分成上下二格，上格大些，下格小些，衣帽放在上格，褲襪鞋子放在下格，在每格旁邊，寫着嬰兒的姓名，第一嬰兒佔一格，絕不能亂。這些手續幹完以後，把嬰兒抱到診察室去，由醫生檢查嬰兒有無疾病。如有疾病的，便送到病房去。病房也分成輕重病房。如果嬰兒疾病十分沉重的，那末由家長領回，轉送醫院去診治；沒有疾病的嬰兒，就放在普通嬰兒所住的房子。</p>
<p>託兒所內對於衛生的設備，非常完善，有藥品室，診察室，輕疾病室，疾病可疑狀室。咳嗽與受凉的嬰兒，也不和健康的嬰兒同住，要放在別的房子。兒童遊戲室中，照他們年齡的大小，分組遊戲，每組一個房子，至多十一二人，有一看護專門管理。</p>
<p>寢室也分成二種：晝寢室與夜寢室。晝寢室大都有很多的窗戶，容易吸取日光。每一寢室中放着白色的有欄杆的小鋼絲床十五六架，床上有很淸潔的白氈子，被單，榨子，褥子等物。嬰兒睡覺之先，穿着一件形似袋子的寢衣，頭脚兩端略小，中間較大，嬰兒睡眠之後，僅僅將頭部露在外面，四肢統統裹在袋裏，不易受凉。臨睡的時候，看護要看寒署表如何而開關小窗（因爲蘇俄氣候很冷，一到冬天，所有的窗戶，都用漆灰緊緊地封閉着，僅在大窗上開一小窗，時常開關，貫通空氣）。夜寢室，是同晝寢室差不多，不過嬰兒所穿的寢衣，不是袋子的受日光。樣子。</p>
<p>嬰兒穿髒了的衣服，寢衣，被單，氈子等等，系統一隔三日洗滌一次。如在夏天，嬰兒晝寢大都睡在露天下，使他們多受日光。每日看護要代嬰兒洗澡，所用的手巾肥皂，也各人分開來，以免傳染疾病。</p>
<p>在寢室與遊戲室中，除嬰兒必要的玩具與臥具外，壁上還扶起有動植物，風景山水等等的畫片，使兒童對環境發生美感，養成美術的觀念。</p>
<p>兒童飲食，有一定的時間與數量，還要依年齡的大小來分別。主要的食品，爲牛奶雞蛋蔬菜等物。廚役購買物品，必須經過醫生檢查，而後烹調給與。</p>
<p>所內工作人員，在工作時間內，一律穿着白色的衣服，沒有關係的人，絕對不許進去。進所去參觀的人，也要穿所中所備的白色衣服，然後由所長或職員引入，對參觀者作詳細的解釋。</p>
<p>嬰兒在託兒所中，祇能養育到三歲，三歲以後，便要送到幼稚園去。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他在H坊的四十五號門首，按了一下電鈴，不一刻便有一個像大司務又像包車夫的中年男子，操着北方口音，打開鐵柵門來，問他是那一位。海泉給了一張名片，並且說明了是由廣州來的親戚，那個男人便很客氣的招呼他進裏面的客堂裏來。</p>
<p>「先生來早了。」</p>
<p>那個雜役笑着端上了一盅熱茶給他。</p>
<p>「還早麼？響過了十點吧。」</p>
<p>「剛響過了。少爺還沒有起身呢。……」</p>
<p>雜役說着，看見房屋裏十分幽暗，便把電燈開亮了。海泉望了望房裏的陳設，是相當的奢華，尤其是裱壁的花紙,異常的鮮艷。不過到了十點多鐘，還看不見陽光。這樣的住宅，不像地獄也像牢監了吧。人生所需要的，第一是空氣，第二是陽光。像他們住在這樣的房屋裏，也未必算是幸福吧。</p>
<p>「少奶奶也沒起身麼？」</p>
<p>海泉此刻很想見見這位佩珍姊姊了，看看她的面貌和身材像不像他的愛佩珠。</p>
<p>「假如自己和佩珠結婚，自己和任碩士便算是兩聯襟了。」</p>
<p>「他們才睡下去不久呢。」</p>
<p>「什麼？他們才睡下去？」</p>
<p>「不是麼？昨晚裏他們打牌打到今早上五點多鐘，各人吃了一碗鷄絲麵，再喝了半盞高麗參湯，才休息去的。」</p>
<p>那個雜役說了後，臉上表示出一種猥鄙的微笑。海泉由這個微笑，直覺着任碩士夫妻的生活的糜爛了。</p>
<p>「說不定，佩珍姊和任碩士此刻的與致還是十分濃厚呢。」</p>
<p>他想到這裏，不禁雙頰發熱了。同時也感着十二分的不好意思。</p>
<p>「那末，我改天再來好了。他們還沒有起床，不攪擾他們了。」　　「沒有什麼要緊的事麼？」</p>
<p>雜役的山東口音。</p>
<p>「沒有什麼事的。」</p>
<p>他說着，走向門首來。同時他又有些羨慕任碩士夫妻的生活。他感着一種矛盾了。</p>
<p>「打牌打到天亮！我眞不知道麻雀有什麼味道。」　　他快要走出門首來了。</p>
<p>「林先生請等一下。剛才老媽子上去伺候過了，少奶奶說，即刻下來，務必請你等一會。……」</p>

<h3>國文課</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>本刊爲一般學生對於國文引起研究的興趣，及揭露敎育界黑暗情形起見，曾設有學堂寫眞一門，故投稿諸君，都爲學校的高材生，而所寫的材料，都半是學生的浪漫情形，此外無非上國文課時。，與敎師開玩笑的資料。，這原不是作者對於國文教師特別有什麼惡感是學堂中一般的現象如此這是何等一件痛心的事呢。</p>
<p>今天我對於一般浪漫的學生，暫且撇開不講，我亦來變談。「國文課。」我也曾吃過開口飯，當過幾年中學大學裏國文敎師，因爲我是以老賣老的關係，學生雖買我面子不敢替我搗蛋，然我細細地考察。，根本信仰國文與喜歡研究國文的學生。，眞是少數的少數。，我看了這樣情形，心中十分難過。。</p>
<p>因爲言語文字爲立國的根本。，是以文化侵略，爲帝國主義者惟一的武器。，故欲滅人之國。，當先滅其言語文字爲主要條件。，現在他國旣有浸浸以文化侵略我國的趨勢，而文化落後的我國。，天然無法抵抗。，然亦不應數典忘祖。，先將言語文字自己滅亡。，因爲我國的文化雖有不合時宜的地方。，而言語言字究竟不在吐棄之列。。</p>
<p>我嘗問之學生，你們爲什麼對於國文，毫無信仰與興趣，他們有幾個答案如下。</p>
<p>一·我們到學堂中來讀書，原以研究英文算學爲宗旨，假定欲形容國文，則家庭中很多良好的敎師，何必費了許多金錢，到學堂中來。</p>
<p>一·英文算學，比較新奇可喜，而國文則不免有陳腐之氣，並且任何職業，能通英文者，其待遇必優，不通英文者，其待遇必劣，這也爲環境所驅迫的緣故，</p>
<p>一·學生程度愈高，則英算功課必愈加嚴重，現在把所有的腦力，專門研究英算，尚覺不敷支配，那裏有工夫去研究國文。</p>
<p>一·國文的分數，最無確切的標準，祇要文理通順，無論如何，總可以「派司」過去，總不及英算的嚴格評判。</p>
<p>這幾個答案，一些也不差。，因爲如此。，所以學生們對於國文一課。，有當作談話課的。，有當作看小說課的有當作寫情書課的。，有當作補習各種課程課的。，他們的觀念如此。，所以對於國文敎師，還能有信仰麼。，還能殻不搗亂麼。，但是要救濟這個毛病。，不是一方面能負責。，要有幾方面來負責。。</p>
<p>一·當國文敎師的，須要研究敎授的方法，與敎課的材料，使學生引起對於國文研究的興趣。</p>
<p>一·學校當局支配課程，不能專門注重英算，必定要使各種科目，平均發展。</p>
<p>一·要减少各種無聊的課程，使學生的腦筋，專注力於各種重要科目。</p>
<p>我因爲。「國文課。」三字。，而聯想到我國國學的衰落。，學生們對於國文。，不肯研究，或不屑研究。，以致有大學畢業生。，而國文文理尙有不能通順者。，故胡亂將得到的感想拉雜寫些出來。，以當談話。</p>

<h3>固體火酒的製法</h3>
<p>— 顧履霜</p>
<p>火酒在平溫中爲液體，且易揮發，至攝氏零度下一百三十度始爲固體。這個溫度，非在特別裝置下不能達到的，即能做成固體，亦不能持久。所以平常要做固體火酒是不可能的事。</p>
<p>科學發達，往往能在死路中開出活路來。這用途很廣（下詳）的固體火酒，旣不能在常溫中得到，化學家便利用用膠質化學的原理，另闢途徑的製造出來，供之大衆，讀者很願意知牠的製法吧。</p>
<p>利用膠質化學以製火酒的方法很多，今將最有成効而簡便的二種方法分述之：</p>
<p>第一法</p>
<p>預備：百份之九十五火酒八十五西西盛一杯中。醋酸鈣之飽和溶液十五西西盛另一杯中，此醋酸鈣飽和溶液，即將醋酸鈣加入溫水中溶化，至不能再溶爲度。</p>
<p>製法：另取一較大之杯，二手各執一上述盛溶液之杯，同時將內容物倒入大杯內，如倒時二手速度平均，即成膠狀之固體火酒。用時只將火點上，即能燃燒。盛固體火酒之器，用舊香烟罐亦好，惟不用時須蓋緊。</p>
<p>上法所得產品，燃燒後有渣滓，第二法所得者則甚少。</p>
<p>第二法</p>
<p>預備：百份之九十火酒一千份放入玻璃器中，乾肥皂碎粒三十份，樹膠二份。</p>
<p>製法：將上盛火酒之器，放在沸水上，杯內物溫度至攝氏六十三度爲止，不可再高，乃將肥皂碎粒及樹膠放入，調和使肥皂完全溶化，傾入香烟罐中，冷後即成固體火酒。</p>
<p>上述二法，製法均甚便利，作者已親自做過，確知其効甚佳。嚴冬天氣，火酒的用途甚大，因火酒傾覆而鬧禍的也不少，若用了固體火酒，便可免一切危險，而火力與液體火酒一樣，且携带便利，旅行家很賞用之。</p>

<h3>幾位先生的素描</h3>
<p>— 渦</p>
<p>國文許先生，外表很滑稽，黧黑的面孔，襯着蓬鬆且捲曲的頭髮；矮小的身軀，空着寬大且齷齪的衣服。他的學問很不差，對於文學，哲學，文字學都有些研究，還有他的音樂也很好。講課的時候，手和脚都要伴同行動，並且笑話也最多，所以很受同學的歡迎。因爲他長於音樂，所以有一課讀一篇桃花扇的選文時，竟在講臺大唱起來，令大家笑得前翻後仰。</p>
<p>英文陳先生，年紀還很輕，是一位小小的作家，曾經出版了一冊鉅著（？）又且在某雜誌也時常有大作發表，所以有一股文學家的神氣·聽說他曾在某大學做過助敎，所以他又學得一般敎授的架子，上課的鐘聲響了之後，至少須過了六七分鐘，才挾着那隻大皮包姍姍來臨，至於他的敎授法，我不敢恭維，但是因爲他是一位作家呢？所以同學們也不敢輕視他·</p>
<p>數學虞先生，漂亮極了，光亮的頭髮，畢挺的西裝，漆黑的皮鞋，，…啊，摩登男子的條件，眞是應有盡有·可是，可是他的學問太差了，尤其是英文程度是太低了，英文最簡單的數學的練習題，也要解釋得七零八落的，不過他給分數却寬得異常，所以沒有吃我們「惟分數是視」的學生的虧，還有他很肯負責任，這學期來都沒有缺過課，這也算是他的長處了。</p>
<p>歷史周先生，是同學敬且畏的一位先生。他的塊頭很大，跑起路來一搖一擺的最可笑。他的國語非常的流利，講歷史眞好像講故事般的，令人愈聽愈有味，所以大家最喜歡上他的課。但是他的考試最是厲害，銳利的目光東照西射，使大家不敢逼視，不敢作弊。</p>
<p>還有一位地理陳先生，他好像一個處女，非常的怕羞，倘若同學對他說了一句取笑的話，面孔立刻赤化了，但是他是永不會發怒的。他的聲音很輕，眼睛又很近視。因爲他是一位寗波人，所以最多的口頭語便是「阿拉」兩字，某好事同學有一課將這兩字講的次數統計一下，竟有四十餘次之多，</p>
<h3>姨太們的厄運</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>「榮貴先生，不但你希望師長快膺新任，其實我們更盼望得急切呢！」十九歲的三姨太見了留住在師長家裏等候差事的賀榮貴先生滿臉愁雲，嬌滴滴地這樣說：</p>
<p>「是的，我們更盼望得急切呢！」年紀反而大兩歲的四姨太搶聲重覆一句;五姨太更接着滔滔地說：</p>
<p>「你知道的，榮貴先生，當我們師長還沒有發猛，駐紥在××省　而且是文官│兼任主席，那時我們是何等愜意！一月的零用，三千五千，不成問題；吃穿的舒服，更不在話下，就是前年降任旅長，總算也還過得去，現在竟减到每月只有五十元的零用了，簡直拏着玩不了那一事，看了戲，就不能又麻將，近來連先前的私積也幾乎全都墊用完了，上月大太太上漢口去探聽師長的消息，我們眞滿懷着希望！只要師長的事成功，那就受她的管束，遭她的白眼也不要緊，偏偏又是一去無消息，講到師長到底是外頭人！只要腰包飽滿，倒還大方，索求總是如願的，榮貴先生，是不是？」</p>
<p>「不錯，不錯，何况你們·就是從前我要向師長拿，也往往三十五十，一說，就到手的·」榮貴先生應着說完，二姨太拿着麻將進來了，于是大家圍下，室內忽然立刻掉換了另一種空氣。</p>
<p>××師長原是××省××縣睡廟廊的一個乞丐，在十三年夏間，因偷了張家灣李四的南瓜，被村長保甲議决把他逐出境界，他便流到××省當兵，「時勢造英雄，」他仗着燈籠大的膽量，剿匪討逆，無不用命告捷，不到兩年工夫，便由兵…而排長…而營長了，十五年出師××，法紀是那麼嚴明，見功論賞，他更勇敢地担任右翼衝鋒，果然攻無不勝，戰無不克，他也就飛快升充師長了，那時他想：「革命，我原不大懂得，不如多積點錢，私地討下幾位小老婆再說·」于是二姨太三姨太…六姨太也就先先後後地進了師長的公館。其後師長更受命兼省主席，無論在軍事或政治上，顯然都站有一席地位了。</p>
<p>那大概是因爲他到底是武夫出身，易受誘惑，鄰省×軍長派來兩位代表向他說，要想大希望，還是要倒戈，他聽了想想：「這果不錯，要想大希望。還是要…」于是他便揭幟通　反×，事實每不易料，竟完全坍台，這是十八年的事。</p>
<p>好容易，忍到十九年六月，才又轉了好多的彎，獲得一個獨立旅長的職差，駐紥富庶的××省××縣·有次縣黨部揭載他的貪污，他火冒透頂，殺了三個黨委，于是又被政府褫了職權。</p>
<p>今年機會頗多，××還是埀靑他，呌他到漢口去等候，臨行時他吩咐幾位姨太太說！</p>
<p>「我倒霉又是兩年了，××城的公館，××縣的地皮，全都變盡了，你們的開銷實在大，光是銀行裏儲的那點欵，夠得幾個月花費？在我沒有重膺新差以前，你們的費用也得稍稍減縮，衣食不用你們管，每月發五十元一個的零用，交由大太太分發，聽者！」</p>
<p>前月師長電傳大太太到漢口去，這可猜想到新任有七八分希望了，于是姨太們全都色飛眉舞，還由二姨太提議湊賀過大太太一場熱鬧牌，而且被師長斥退了的六姨太也又倩人上門求容了，</p>
<p>大太太一去月餘，全無消息，已夠使姨太們感到十一分失望；何况師長忽差回一個勤務兵，說要姨太們典當金器，湊足一千元去辦運動，這更使姨太們感到厄運的降臨了。</p>
<h3>花緞馬褂</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>張大媽眼望着兒子兩手筒在袖裏，聳起了肩窩到工廠去。想着自己坐在家裏吃飯，反穿上了薄棉襖，雖說阿福是我兒子，但能眼望自己的兒子受凍嗎？况且二十幾歲的年紀，知道家裏窮，從沒有把賺來的工錢，像李家的小丁一樣花到女人身上去。本來姓張的也是小康之家，都被他的爸爸化得一干二淨，虧得阿福孝順，不然，我這老命也難活了。張大媽想到這裏，不由得眼淚流了下來；而兒子的棉袍却鎖在當裏，非有四元錢，是不能把它贖出來的　對這難問題，張大媽竟坐在箱子邊出了神。</p>
<p>最後她終於鼓足了勇去倒翻那隻箱子，她明知道裏面是幾件不値錢的破衣服，但是人生永遠不完的希望│她希望偶然會發現一件可以稍微値價點的衣服。破的舊的，簡直認不淸是上衣或是褲子的東西，拖滿了地·張大媽快活得發狂似的從箱底裏抽出一件全新的花緞馬褂，那還是張大爺臨死前一個月做的，張大媽因爲看見了這馬褂傷心，就隨手往那裏一塞，現在居然給了她極大的一個希望。</p>
<p>「這一件馬褂，做的時候，怕不二十來塊錢，又祇上過一回身，抵兒子的一件棉袍總可以，或者還能多兩塊錢，替兒子買斤大黑棗補補，」張大媽挾着用破包袱鄭重摺疊好了的馬褂，一路走一路想。</p>
<p>她像做賊一樣的四面張望，見路上沒有行人，就很快的轉進當子的屏風中。她昂着頭把包袱送上去，朝奉很隨意的翻着「當多少錢」？那聲音老是像法庭上審問兇犯·因爲他們最不歡迎又舊又不合時的衣服。</p>
<p>「先生，五…塊錢…吧」·張大媽恐多說了被朝奉叱責，少說了又捨不得丈去紙上一次身的花緞馬褂。</p>
<p>「呸！」那包袱不是張大媽搶得快，早已丟在地上。</p>
<p>「先生，這樣罷」，張大媽戰戰競競的掏出棉袍的當票，把馬褂同時送上去「調一件，先生」，</p>
<p>朝奉看淸了當票上的數目是三元四角不行，不行」！把高櫃上的東西又往下一推，</p>
<p>「先生，那馬褂是花緞的啊」！</p>
<p>「不要」！顯然是怪他不識貨而生了氣。</p>
<p>「先生，倒底值幾鈿」？</p>
<p>「一塊二角」！</p>
<p>「先生，三塊罷」，張大媽想，袋裏還有幾毛大洋，也可免强把棉袍贖出來。</p>
<p>朝奉似乎沒有這許多閒功夫，理都沒有理她。</p>
<p>張大媽在回家的路上想「窮人的花緞馬褂竟這樣不値錢！」</p>

<h3>同情者（五續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>他母親道：這不貴似金子嗎？現在鄉下是五荒六月·稻也只賣四塊錢一担，八塊錢是兩担稻？那還了得？這書還念得起呀！孟國賓聽了母親這話，心裏非常之不高興，一生氣就進房去了。進房之後，果然桌子上油燈點着，茶壺凉着，桌子下一縷靑烟，轉着雲頭子，向上升騰着。桌子邊，放了一把靑竹椅子，端端正正，擦得一點灰跡都沒有。心裏便想着，家裏人對我總算不錯，我常想到，我家裏也是個小資產階級。可是我家裏若不是小資產階級，那有錢我念書，我也就不知道什麼呌小資產階級了。不過像我父親這種人，思想總是頑固的，我說王老二是個被壓迫者，他竟不以爲然，以爲他揀了人家兩担多種，分得了一半稻吃，就很好了。他不想那一半分給那坐享其成的大地主，很是枉哩。我父親這種行爲，便可以代表小地主的意見，正好記上一筆。明天，我可以找着王老二談談，看他們對於田東的言論如何？如此想着，在衣服口袋裏，掏出那枝價值十六元的自來水筆，又掏出一本日記本子，在上面寫了一行道；地主之意，以爲彼以資財購得之田地，給與佃戶耕種，佃戶理應分與出產物之一半，至於彼未嘗致分毫之力量於耕種，則不問也。在這段論文之後，自己又在日記本子上列出幾個問題來，預備明天去作和王老二談話的資料。他回家來，已經有了三天，這調查農村經濟的工作，也就應該開始了。他擬過問題之後，又把帶回來的幾本社會科學書，翻閱了幾遍，作個學理上的參考，然後上床去睡覺。因爲用腦過度神經起了反應，上床便夢到王老二家去。王二嫂泡着茶，炒了瓜子，格外的殷勤招待。他夢裏所得的收穫，實在比醒時優厚多了。次日睡醒、一看手表，是九點鐘，可是家裏人吃過早飯，大哥二哥，已經到田岸上去看人車水，大嫂二嫂在各人屋子裏輯麻，母親帶了兩個姪女，上菜園摘菜，兩個姪子，上鄉學讀書去了。到了這太陽高照的時候，家裏却是靜悄悄的。他又得了一個感想，覺得自己家裏雖是小資產階級，却不是有閒階級，鄉下人大概很少是有閒階級的。他正如此想着，不知道怎樣把家裏人驚動了，於是大嫂伺候茶水，二嫂和他炒飯吃，母親也得了消息，把衣櫉下層藤簸籮裏收藏的　蛋拿了兩個出來，炒了給他作菜。孟國寳固然知道家裏人對他很殷勤，然而這種殷勤，有些過分，覺得是反讓他感受一種不快。怱怱的吃了飯，看看太陽去正當中不遠，這是鄉下人所謂半上午，比鐘點還靠得住的，所以孟國賓也舍了他的鐘表不看，只看那太陽的影子，這個時候，到了王老二約會的時候，於是整了一整衣服，用手摸了摸頭髮，自向王老二家來。他口　旱烟袋，正在大門口觀　着，見孟國寶來了。連忙　了腰道，孟先生來了，請裏面坐。（未完）</p>

<p>十六歲時，她已聞名於當地的交際界；可是那時還是孤獨的一身，因爲她抱着「有自由的靈魂才是算自由」的宗旨。她父母也很贊許她這個意思，最後讓她到自由之邦的美國來了。</p>
<p>在美國某村，她有一個親戚，築有很美麗的別墅，她就投奔到那裏。她剛到那裏二十四小時內，就有許多不相識的男子來拜訪她，可多被婉辭拒絕了。只是在家勤奮的習練綱球和游泳，但美麗活潑，和久在美的環境中薰洗的她，究竟不會永久英雄埋沒的，所以她到美國，不到半年，就蜚聲於社會了。雷電華公司聞名，就邀她到銀幕上來，這就是主影界的第一聲。</p>
<p>以後憑着她的天才和努力，在好萊塢就漸有人注意她了。不久，她的自由的靈魂，已被束縛（？）；因爲她已有了愛的伴侶，他是當地一個漂亮的而且未結過婚的靑年。她倆常伴着跳舞，游泳。</p>
<p>她除了喜歡音樂外，還有搜藏中國的磁器，古玩的嗜好。最近她又愛搜集甲殼，常伴着人划了船，到冷僻的孤島上去，帶了不少的甲殻回來。總之，她的一切，多很神秘和怪僻，確是好萊塢U（Uｎｋｎｏｗｎ）類女子的一個典型。但我們却不願這個U字女郎和李却迪克斯在這張Rｏａｒ　ｏｆ　ｔｈｅ　Dｒａｇｏｎ和我們會面。</p>
<p>編者按：Roar　of　the　Dragon一片，在美國放映之後，輿論極不佳，內容粗淺惡劣，表演幼稚無味，美國人已有定評，大概不至到我國來現眼，請讀者放心吧。</p>

<h3>電影在臺灣</h3>
<p>— 星宿</p>
<p>被日本割據而去的臺灣，是一處山川奇秀的地方，計分基隆，臺北，臺南，臺中，高雄，花蓮港（便是臺東）等六州　現在各州都通了火車。交通已很見便利，市面也漸興盛。計現在開映的電影院有二十餘家之多，大半是日本人所創設，所以映的影片，多數也是日本的出品。電影院的佈置，全係日本化，觀衆入場，都是席地而坐。院裏僱有專員，在場中高念說明書，如今此風已漸革。該處僑胞很多，對於祖國出品的影片，極得熱烈的歡迎。統計我國自有電影至今，輸入的影片已有二百多種，當推明星和天一兩家公司的出品，最得信仰。其他如友聯等小組織公司的出品，輸入的也不少。聯華公司出品似不很賣座，原因是臺灣的民風好勇，智識階級較少，所以對於武俠影片就格外的歡迎。在上海經營販片商有四人，販往臺灣的版權費，照版權兩年期限計算，每部無聲片至少須七八百元，多至一千二三百元不等，視片的是否得受該地觀衆歡迎而定。惜乎我國電影界，對於該地版權，似不很注意。倘得改良經營，却是一個極好的推銷國產影片的市場。</p>

<h3>「戰地二孤女」</h3>
<p>在滬濱喧傳了很久的「戰地二孤女」，爲什麼又沉寂了呢？一定是關心於國片的人們，能希望知道的吧。</p>
<p>牠在九月間攝成之後，曾被中央電檢公會禁止公映一次；後來經過疏通之後，終究領下護照·不料到了上海，又被租界當局禁映了。天一公司以爲旣不能在租界放映，又不願到租界以外的小戲院映，這一來，上海公演之說，只好擱淺·但是京蘇一帶，却早已演了！</p>
<p>記者上次赴京，曾在首都的南京大戲院，看着了牠·所以略談一談。</p>
<p>片子很長，劇情也很複雜：大路是；因爲滬戰之變有一個弱女，家破人亡·她父親爲救另一女郎而死，兩位女郎，一見之下，不及問及姓名，又被冲散·那被救女郎，就寄居表兄家中，與表兄又訂了婚約·好事多磨，她表兄却愛上了一位女敎員·於是她盡力使她表兄斷絕他戀·後來，她表兄從軍，遇着一位看護，竟是舊情人·（那女敎員）她也看出那女敎員，就是爲她犧牲老父的孤女；於是她就把未婚夫││表兄│　護給了她的情敵││恩人││·自已加入了女子戰隊；但是她情敵，也不願意以三角戀愛中的勝利者自居，所以仍前線看護工作。</p>
<p>這片中介紹了一位新告成功的男女角陸麗霞，也很稱職，而主角胡珊，是最動人的了，在南京，許多人批評說：她比她姊姊││胡蝶││，還要高一籌呢　　我希望在不久的將來，在上海的人，也能看到這張片子，我認爲比天一代表作『蘭谷萍踪』還好些。</p>

<h3>出了攝影場以後女明星們在做麼生？（下）</h3>
<p>— 星宿</p>
<p>陳玉梅是一位提倡儉約的女明星，交際場中很少走動，她除了攝戲，便是持理家務，她還沒有孩子，她是天一公司的代表明星，明星公司的代表明星是胡蝶，這兩位兩家公司的代表明星的生活，可就大不相同，胡蝶雖現在也已儉約得多了，但是她終還是姑娘身份，愛在跳舞場裏走走，和交際場中活動，或是在明星的歌劇社裏學習唱唱平劇。</p>
<p>回力球場裏男明星去玩的很多，女明星中時常去的，就有一位嚴月閑，跳舞場裏，有時候她當然也去，她女朋友很多，在不攝戲的時候，她也是少在家裏的，朱秋痕就和她不同，在家裏不大出門的。</p>
<p>健談而且帶點孩子氣的談瑛，只是愛玩耍，近來忙着她「賴婚」案上訴的事，王人美和黎莉莉這兩位有朝氣而健美的姑娘，她們對於體育運動，似乎都愛參觀，也愛把會報作消遣，她們的男友都很多，可是她們的活潑和浪漫，和胡蝶談瑛等這一般明星又不同了。</p>
<p>此外還有喜歡在烟榻上吞雲吐霧的女星。這是委實可恨，可惜，而且可怕，會使她們容易成就紅粉骷髏的（完）</p>

<h3>無人不能的「笑」</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>從表情獨習法第一式到第五式，我們已經練習過五種最基本的表情。這五種表情，雖然也有種種的變化，但是比較的，還是易於練習，因爲都是很簡單的，而且各種地位的人，表演起來，都是差不多的。</p>
<p>現在我們要更進一步，說到練習比較複雜一點而且變化更多的表情了。第一就是無人不能的「笑」。</p>
<p>不錯，凡是人，沒有一個不會笑的。就是在母親懷裏吃孩子，都會笑的，這何必要練習呢？殊不知笑這一種表情，在表演藝術裏，是最難表演得恰到好處的一種表情。稍微有點導演或是表演經驗的人，都知道。在導演發笑的鏡頭時，常常要感到許多的困難。因爲各種不同地位的人，必須發出各種不同樣的笑容來，就日常的生活，我們就有淺笑，假笑，譏笑，冷笑，好笑，媚笑，傻笑，狂笑，捧腹大笑，等等不同的笑。導演要你大笑的時候，你對着鏡頭，偏偏來一個皮笑肉不笑，或者要你表演一個露齒的微笑，你偏偏忍不住的來了一個捧腹大笑，甚至於你自以是笑，而留在膠片上的影子，偏偏好像在那裏哭。這樣的錯誤，往往能夠蹧蹋許多尺的膠片，而且還要犧牲許多同伴的寳貴光陰。這都是因爲你對於自己的笑，沒有隨時注意，沒有練習到確有充分的把握。這緣故也就是你平日把這無人不能的笑，太藐視了。</p>

<h3>League of Nations Assembly to Open Today</h3>
<p>Chairman Hymans, Chinese and Japanese Representatives to Deliver Important Speeches</p>
<p>Session Scheduled for Four Days, Rumor is Actionable Steps Will Be Avoided</p>
<p>Gu Weijun's Full Text of Refutation of Japanese Memorandum Published</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources report that the League of Nations Special Assembly is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on the 6th. Fifty-seven countries will participate. The Assembly Chairman will still be Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans. According to a Geneva cable received by the government, the agenda for the first Assembly session on the 6th will be: (1) The Chairman announces the reasons for convening the Special Assembly and his hopes for this Assembly. (2) Speech by the Chief Representative of China, Yan Huiqing. (3) Speech by the Chief Representative of Japan, Matsuoka. (4) Speeches by representatives of other countries. The plenary sessions on the 6th, both morning and afternoon, will be open to the public, with a total of four days of meetings. It is scheduled to close on the 9th. Only a partial resolution is prepared, passing the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report regarding the factual parts and the non-recognition of the puppet state. No actionable steps of a coercive nature will be taken. Concrete solutions will be transferred back to the Committee of Nineteen. Furthermore, many representatives from other countries wish to speak at this Assembly. British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Premier Herriot have both arrived in Geneva to attend in person, which is highly valued by all parties. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Special Assembly is scheduled to open tomorrow at 11:00 AM (6:00 PM Shanghai time). Representatives from 55 countries will attend. The Chinese delegation demands that the Assembly make a firm decision to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with Article 15 of the League Covenant. The Japanese delegation will demand that all countries recognize its creation of the puppet state, claiming that if the "Manchukuo" is opposed, peace in the Far East cannot be guaranteed. It intends to intimidate all countries with the threat of a world war. It also strongly argues that the confrontations in the Eastern Provinces are not a war and that the Japanese military actions have not disrupted peace, therefore opposing the application of Article 15. It is expected that tomorrow, the smaller countries will rise up to oppose Japan's sophistry. (5th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the small member states of the League of Nations yearn to maintain the peace agreement, the major powers clearly do not wish to take any concrete action at this time. It is anticipated that the League of Nations Assembly will instruct the Committee of Nineteen to submit a final solution proposal to the Assembly. This proposal can serve as a response to China's request for a solution to the Northeast incident, but it does not block further reconciliation between China and Japan. General observation suggests that a critical period has arrived. The Chinese government should urgently adopt definite conditions for resolving this case without compromising national sovereignty in preparation for this. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Refutes Matsuoka's Remarks and Japan's Memorandum</h3>
<p>Japanese Fallacies Cannot</p>
<p>Shake the Lytton Report</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat today distributed a lengthy document submitted by Dr. Gu Weijun, refuting Matsuoka's remarks to the Executive Yuan and Japan's views on the Lytton Report, stating that no part of Japan's memorandum and remarks can alter the most important events in the Manchurian situation as found by the Lytton Commission, or the conclusions drawn by the Lytton Commission from this matter.</p>
<p>The Puppet State Must Be Dissolved, Losses Must Be Compensated: The incident of September 18, 1931, was indeed caused by the Japanese military authorities to carry out their traditional policy of aggression and expansion on the Asian continent. Although Japan has repeatedly made promises to the League of Nations not to aggravate the situation, military actions continued to expand to the farthest regions of the Three Eastern Provinces, implementing its long-prepared attack and attempting to occupy all of the Three Eastern Provinces. The destruction of Chinese governance, the organization of independence movements, the establishment of "Manchukuo," and the recognition of "Manchukuo" are all stages in a predetermined process. Public gatherings, demonstrations, and the submission of petitions by delegations were all entirely arranged by the Japanese to deceive other countries. Japan's fundamentalism, using accomplished facts, represents the completion of the second act in Japan's policy of dominating and conquering the Far East, defying the world. However, the interests of China, the sovereignty of the Three Eastern Provinces, and the sacrifices of Japanese aggression cannot be ignored. Therefore, the withdrawal of Japanese troops should be implemented as soon as possible. China can never accept the maintenance and recognition of the current situation in the Three Eastern Provinces. Therefore, the dissolution of "Manchukuo" is an indispensable condition in any satisfactory solution. For the sake of maintaining peace based on justice, aggression should never be condoned, and the victims of aggression must be fully compensated.</p>
<p>Japan Violates Faith and Destroys Treaty Obligations: The Japanese side believes that the plan advocated by the Lytton Commission requires strong and reliable central governments on both sides. It should be known that China has always respected international obligations, and for the sake of an early resolution, Japan must have a reliable central government. The League of Nations and the great powers have had painful experiences and know that the solemn obligations Japan undertook under the League Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty have been violated. The various promises given by the Japanese representatives, such as not attacking Jinzhou and Qiqihar, withdrawing Japanese troops to the railway zone, and stopping political and military actions that aggravate the situation, have not been fulfilled. From the perspective of the Chinese delegation, in international relations, it is better to have a weak but reliable government than a strong but unreliable government, as an unreliable government is a fundamental danger to international order.</p>
<p>The Solution to the Sino-Japanese Problem Should Conform to the Peace Pact: The Chinese representative's document quotes page 129 of the Lytton Report, stating that in addition to China and Japan, other countries also have important interests that must be defended in the Sino-Japanese conflict. Any sincere and lasting solution to the agreement must be in accordance with the multilateral treaty provisions related to world peace. If the application of the principles of the League Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact loses credibility anywhere in the world, the value and effectiveness of these principles will be reduced everywhere in the world. The Chinese government is faithful to international obligations and always considers general peace, so it shares the same view as the investigation team and believes that any solution to the Sino-Japanese problem must conform to the provisions of the League Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteers Are Fighting Fiercely with the Japanese Army: The Chinese representative's memorandum is 48 pages long and elaborates in great detail on the situation in the Far East and Japan's views on this issue, mentioning the situation between China and Japan and Japan's continental policy, stating that this policy is the main reason for the instability of Japan's finances and society today and that Japan is currently in the hands of the military. The Chinese representative's document denies the claim of Chinese xenophobia, citing various xenophobic lessons in Japanese school textbooks. It also states that the responsibility for boycotting Japanese goods lies with Japan, not China. The reason for the boycott is Japan's responsibility. If the cause is eliminated, the boycott movement will also disappear. The Three Eastern Provinces have always been recognized diplomatically as an integral part of China. Japan's so-called special status in the Three Eastern Provinces is merely a facade for its policy of expansion and conquest on the Asian continent. The document details the September 18th Incident and the establishment of "Manchukuo," continuing that the investigation team received a total of 1,548 letters, all opposing the establishment of the puppet state. This does not mean that all those who did not write to the investigation team support the puppet state. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians are still fighting against the Japanese and Manchurian armies in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces, which is clear evidence of the local people's opposition to the puppet state. The document briefly describes the current situation in the Three Eastern Provinces, stating that the people there are currently under the Japanese reign of terror. Newspapers and news are all censored, innocent people are often arrested, villages are bombed without cause, and the Japanese indiscriminately kill civilians. In short, the situation in the Three Eastern Provinces is extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Engage in Radio Debate</h3>
<p>Yan Huiqing Asks the League of Nations to Resolve the Matter Quickly</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke Asks the League of Nations to Be Patient</p>
<p>(Geneva) Matsuoka and Yan Huiqing today successively used broadcast radio to state their government's reasons. The Japanese representative spoke first, followed by the Chinese representative, both using English in their speeches. All of Europe and America could hear them. Matsuoka said that Japan does not want Manchuria and that what Japan seeks from the League of Nations is patience. Japan wants to cooperate with the League of Nations forever. The Chinese government cannot manage its own land, so how can it demand governance over affiliated territories? "Manchukuo" will prosper after the banditry is quelled and will not be the same as the suffering of the Chinese people within their own borders. Japan wants peace, wants to cooperate with the League of Nations permanently. Japan deeply regrets the League of Nations' hasty actions. Japan believes that the League of Nations will regret it in the future. Dr. Yan Huiqing stated that China, in accordance with the League Covenant, has the right to have the League of Nations resolve the Manchurian issue quickly. If the League of Nations does not resolve it immediately, it will not only lead to more bloodshed and increase the suffering of 30 million people in the Northeast, but it will also cause the world's trust in the League of Nations, which sees the League of Nations as a pillar of peace and justice, to be lost beyond repair. Dr. Yan recounted the events of the past year, stating that Japan's repeated acts of aggression, its intention to invade neighboring countries to satisfy its ambition to expand its territory, and its willingness to violate the League Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty are beyond doubt. Japan has not fulfilled its promise to withdraw its troops and is still moving forward continuously, consolidating its position in the Three Eastern Provinces of China. Lord Lytton recently said in a speech in the British House of Lords that the League of Nations should handle this matter quickly, now is the time. If the Manchurian issue is repeatedly delayed, the harm will be great. Lytton's words are worth pondering. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representatives Meet with Simon and Davis</h3>
<p>Take Advantage of Disarmament Proposal Opportunity</p>
<p>To Exchange Views on Sino-Japanese Issues</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning at 10:30 AM (5:30 PM Shanghai time), U.S. disarmament representative Davis met with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon to discuss the arms reduction issue and war debt issues. At 11:15 AM, French Premier Herriot and Minister of War Paul-Boncour also arrived. The content of the Anglo-Franco-American tripartite meeting is unclear. Japanese representative Matsuoka also visited the British Prime Minister and the British Foreign Minister, requesting them to use the power of the great powers to suppress the small countries. (5th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A Geneva dispatch reports that the Japanese disarmament delegation has completed the preparation of a Japanese naval disarmament proposal. Representatives Matsudaira and Nagano decided to visit the British and American representatives Simon and Davis on the morning of the 5th to explain the content of the Japanese disarmament proposal. Representatives Nagano and Sato presented the content of the disarmament proposal to France and Italy. However, the formal presentation to the League of Nations may be in a few days. Representative Matsudaira intends to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue with British Foreign Minister Simon during the meeting, as Foreign Minister Simon is in charge of the Sino-Japanese issue in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the outcome of their meeting is noteworthy. Plenipotentiary Sato also intends to seek an opportunity to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue with the French and Italian sides. (5th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese disarmament conference representative Ambassador Matsudaira is scheduled to visit the British and American disarmament representatives on the morning of the 5th. Ambassador Sato will visit the French and Italian representatives, and Major General Hasegawa will visit the escorts of various countries, each explaining the content of Japan's new disarmament proposal separately. According to Japan's new proposal, the purpose is to resist the U.S. Navy's dominance in the Pacific. It is reported that the U.S. representative has received a report from the military attache in China, stating that Japan will use the name of "Manchukuo" to build a "Manchukuo" navy for its own use, thereby substantially undermining the naval balance between Britain, the United States, and Japan. How the U.S. representative will deal with Japan's new proposal is noteworthy. (4th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka's Speech Content at the Assembly</h3>
<p>Emphasizing the Japanese Government Has No Way to Maintain Lasting Peace in the Far East</p>
<p>Except to Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft of the speech by Chief Plenipotentiary Matsuoka on the first day of the General Assembly on the 6th has been largely completed. Matsuoka declined visitors last night and finished the draft late into the night. The General Assembly will first hear a speech by the Chinese representative, and the Chinese delegation's views will be published on the 5th, so it is necessary to discuss in detail and make appropriate revisions to the draft. The speech draft is very long. If it does not harm the position of the Japanese government, the content and main point of Plenipotentiary Matsuoka's speech will not be much different from those at the Council and other occasions. However, it will touch upon the core of the Sino-Japanese problem from the higher perspective of peace in the Far East, emphasizing that the Japanese government has no way to maintain lasting peace in the Far East except to recognize "Manchukuo." Matsuoka's grand eloquence is expected at that time. (5th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Uchida Says Rapid Resolution of Sino-Japanese Problem is Difficult</h3>
<p>Japanese Government's Attitude Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the League of Nations Provisional Assembly to be held tomorrow, Foreign Minister Uchida made the following remarks to reporters: Although the League of Nations Provisional Assembly is being held, the attitude of the Japanese government will not change. To maintain the independence of Manchuria and to continue to hold peace in the Far East, no other preparation is needed. It is sufficient to maintain the previous position. All decisions have been entrusted to Representative Matsuoka. The League of Nations is not solely for handling the Sino-Japanese problem. The most important problems of European and American countries in recent times, such as the disarmament problem and the war debt problem, are piled up like mountains. Because Japan is facing special circumstances such as China, rapid resolution is very difficult. A long-term approach is necessary. (5th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka's Empty Threats</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Provisional Assembly will open tomorrow. Today, Representative Matsuoka spoke to reporters as follows: The General Assembly will open tomorrow, and all preparations have been completed. I have also decided to have a full awareness. My heart can be said to have no dark clouds. Now I am proceeding according to the beliefs promised by the people when I departed from Tokyo. This belief is a grand righteousness, and with the unanimous support of the people, I have no fear and am quite firm. The Manchurian problem has always been misunderstood by European and American countries, and those who disrupt peace in the Orient are not tolerated by Japan, no matter who they are. I have repeatedly endured, but now I can no longer endure, which prevents Japan from adopting self-defense measures and maintaining peace measures. If ignored, peace in the Far East will inevitably be difficult to maintain. At the General Assembly, small countries will vigorously act, but I am not afraid of the actions of these people. The reason why small countries are nervous is because of the oppression of big countries, thinking that Japan will also oppress small countries. I will fully explain Japan's true intentions at the General Assembly to correct the misconceptions of small countries. Japan is not trying to embarrass small countries in order to achieve peace in the Far East, but is doing so based on the traditional Japanese spirit of helping the weak and suppressing the strong. Japan has never oppressed small countries, and will permanently tend towards small countries in the future, wanting to sweep away the dreams of small countries. My speech will take about an hour. (5th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army on the South Manchurian Railway Attacks Kaiyuan Station</h3>

The volunteer army captured 2 mountain guns, 6 machine guns, and more than 200 rifles, shot down 2 enemy planes, and killed a Japanese major. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Baiquan Have Withdrawn to Keshan</h3>
<p>Laha Is Currently in Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>(Beiping) The National Salvation Army on the Qiqihar-Keshan Line has been fighting with the joint Japanese-puppet army for more than ten days. The Japanese army is using aircraft to assist in the battle, and the fighting is fierce. There have been countless deaths on both sides. The Japanese army in Baiquan has withdrawn to Keshan, and the Japanese army in Taian Town is also at a disadvantage. Laha is currently in fierce fighting. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Increase Forces in Tongliao Area, Demonstrating Towards Kalu</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang's troops are currently reinforcing their strength in the Gaoli Ban area north of Kalu. Last month, the Japanese army increased its forces by 15,000 men, several armored vehicles in the areas of Taonan, Tongliao, Liaoyuan, and Kaitong, demonstrating towards Kalu from time to time. The volunteer army in Kangping Faku was lost due to the conspiracy of Chinese traitors. The volunteer army has now retreated to a certain location to wait for an opportunity to launch a joint counterattack. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Pinghan Railway Will Soon Replace Sleepers and Rails</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Jingwu said that the Pinghan Railway will begin to replace sleepers and rails immediately. The entire line has 130 locomotives and more than 2,000 cars. The Pinghan Railway opens for traffic 8 times a week. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Soviet Army Adopts a Calm Attitude, Luring the Enemy Deep</p>
<p>Empty Cars Fully Loaded with Earth and Stone Ram Japanese Armored Trains</p>
<p>After a Head-on Collision, Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen cabled that the Japanese army has been attacking our troops very urgently. Recently, they have launched a general offensive with both land and air forces. The enemy forces participating include those of Takabo, Hattori, Motegi, Hiraga, etc. Currently, there are several feet of accumulated snow, and morale is low. Our troops are concentrated in the Zhu Jiagangzi and Nianzishan areas to prevent the enemy army from advancing. The railway has been blown up, and other troops have been sent to strike the flanks of the enemy. Fierce fighting is currently underway. The enemy has suffered heavy losses. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The fighting situation between the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army and the Japanese army on the Chinese Eastern Railway has not received Su Bingwen's telegram for several days. According to a private telegram from Manzhouli, the front-line troops are fighting hard in the snow. Su Bingwen and Xie Ke have gone to the front. A representative said that there are many high mountains between Zhalantun and Boketu on the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the snow is four or five feet deep in the ditches. The Soviet army has built solid artillery defense ditches. The Japanese army is unfamiliar with the terrain, and it is not easy to attack. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Qiqihar It is heard that Su Bingwen's army is adopting a calm, lure-in-the-enemy policy to deal with the Japanese army's general offensive, waiting for the Japanese army to enter the Greater Khingan Range, then fighting a decisive battle with the Japanese army. The Japanese army's Miyamoto vanguard team is said to have occupied Xing'an Station and advanced to the mountains of the Greater Khingan Range yesterday afternoon, occupying the Hailar tunnel to confront each other. Our army is on the west side of the range, and the Japanese are in the mountain on the east side. The Miyamoto unit is riding armored trains, wanting to use armored trains to break through the Hailar tunnel. Our army prepared several air force vehicles fully loaded with earth and stone, waiting for the Japanese armored train to enter the tunnel, then driving the empty vehicle from the mountain into the tunnel, resulting in a head-on collision with the Japanese armored train in the tunnel. On the spot, the Japanese armored train overturned, with countless casualties. (5th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Qiqihar Su Bingwen's army is using the natural hazards near the Xing'an Ridge Tunnel to strongly resist the Japanese army. The Miyamoto unit organized a suicide squad to pursue the Soviet army's position. (5th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Qiqihar The Japanese army headquarters announced that the Hattori unit is currently advancing across the Greater Khingan Range by train and automobile. The Miyamoto unit arrived at the eastern end of the Greater Khingan Ridge Tunnel at 1:00 AM on the 4th. According to aerial reconnaissance, the west entrance of the tunnel is covered with thick snow. It appears that the main forces of the Su and Zhang armies are in the Greater Khingan Range. (4th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Qiqihar The Japanese Miyamoto unit occupied the Greater Khingan Ridge Tunnel on the evening of the 4th, controlling the throat of Hulun, and the first phase of the operation was completed. The second phase of the operation is now being implemented. The Japanese Miyamoto unit's armored train passed through the loop line in front of the Greater Khingan Ridge Tunnel at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Soviet army used the forward slope to advance freight cars loaded with rocks forward, ramming the Japanese train. (4th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News of the Japanese army's offensive in western Heilongjiang is often contradictory. Today's Japan Daily News reported that a part of Miyamoto's brigade occupied Yakshi (transliteration), about fifty miles east of Hailar, at noon on Sunday. That is, the Japanese army has gone far beyond the Xing'an Range. However, according to a bulletin from Japan United Press in Qiqihar, the Japanese army reached the eastern entrance of the Xing'an Ridge Tunnel yesterday. According to reports from reconnaissance planes, the four entrances of the tunnel have been buried by snow. Another message said that a team of Japanese soldiers is now volunteering to enter the tunnel to clear mines and other obstacles. According to sources responsible in Tokyo, the scope of the Japanese army's offensive towards Manzhouli has not been agreed upon with Soviet Russia. However, before the war, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the Japanese Charge d'Affaires in Moscow to send a note to Karakhan, saying that Japan still hopes to persuade General Su Bingwen to negotiate with the Japanese representative.

<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese army occupied Boketu, nine miles east of the Xing'an Ridge, on the afternoon of Saturday last week. The tunnel between the Xing'an and Yiktan stations was not damaged. Previously, the Japanese side feared that the Soviet army would destroy the Xing'an Ridge tunnel to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Now the Japanese army has arrived at the tunnel area. According to Japanese rumors, the Japanese military authorities expect to occupy Hailar around December 10. Also according to Japanese sources, the Japanese army's attack last Saturday did not encounter any resistance. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Liu Wenhui's Telegram to Nanjing Expresses Obedience to the National Government's Explicit Order</h3>
<p>Also Requests Strict Orders to Liu Xiang</p>
<p>To Immediately Cease Military Actions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, telegraphed the National Government on the 2nd, expressing his obedience to the explicit order, stating roughly: "Today, I received the telegram order from your esteemed government, forwarded by the Director of the Secretariat, reiterating the order for the governance of Sichuan from the 17th year of the Republic, instructing the Executive Yuan to determine detailed implementation methods and ensure their thorough implementation within the shortest possible time, etc. Upon receiving this, I deeply admire your esteemed government's concern for Sichuan affairs, your compassion for the people's suffering, your lament over the escalation of war, and your hope for the immediate cessation of hostilities. Your candid admonitions are thorough and detailed, taking the obedience of each army as the standard of obedience and disobedience. Upon receiving this, I am filled with shame and remorse. If there is any humanity at all, how can one not be moved? The troops in Chongqing have recklessly initiated hostilities, causing disaster for the entire Sichuan due to one person, and my own integrity is lacking, making it difficult to atone for myself even with a hundred deaths. I have repeatedly impeached myself, hoping for your esteemed government's discernment. Since I, Wenhui, mistakenly assumed the leadership of Sichuan, I have followed the outline for governing Sichuan from the 17th year of the Republic and immediately held meetings with General Liu Xiang and the heads of various armies to earnestly implement it. Unexpectedly, an incident occurred, leading to the Battle of Shangdong. Not only is it difficult to implement the government's orders, but all administrative affairs have been obstructed. The key to this lies in Xiang's personal ambitions. Last year, I personally went to Chongqing to sincerely negotiate, but his ambition was fully revealed, and no solution could be reached. I am unable to live up to your esteemed government's mandate, and I, Wenhui, dare not argue, but this is indeed the source of the problem. Your esteemed government has long been aware of this and cannot escape your keen insight. Tracing back his heart of not obeying your esteemed government's orders, he has long harbored the plan to annex Sichuan. Since the beginning of hostilities last month, I have strived to avoid them and called for peace, retreating step by step from Suisui to Jinning, not hesitating to compromise myself, because the national crisis is pressing, the responsibility for national defense is heavy, and I respect your esteemed government's order to strive for peace and cannot bear to expand the civil war and bring disaster to the people. The facts are clear, and I have repeatedly reported it on record. Later, Xiang used warships and aircraft to approach Hechuan County, wreaking havoc and turning the city into ruins, and also used aircraft to disturb the provincial capital of Chengdu and various other places, dropping bombs and killing many civilians. The people of the entire province are pleading for rescue. This is truly what your telegram said, that the military's elite are being lost due to civil war, and the common people's flesh and blood are being used as weapons. Furthermore, he even had his generals, such as Tang Shizun, issue an outline for governing Sichuan to cover up his crimes in Sichuan, not knowing that his disregard for the central government and his destruction of laws and regulations only serve to make his guilt more obvious. Therefore, in the Jiangnan Daily last month, I formulated concrete measures based on your esteemed government's previous orders and reported them to your esteemed government for examination and verification, seeking opinions from all parties. Fortunately, I received sympathy from both inside and outside and received a reply telegram of approval. However, Liu Xiang's troops moving west are still relentlessly advancing. Now that I have received your esteemed government's telegram, clearly reiterating the order, it is like a bright mirror in the sky and a thunderclap awakening dormant creatures. I, Wenhui, should respectfully obey and await instructions. However, I fear that Liu Xiang, deluded by the dream of military force and disregarding the difficulties of the nation, cannot be persuaded by reason, and it is inevitable that the prestige of your esteemed government will be severely damaged, leading to criticism from outsiders. I beg you to strictly order Liu Xiang and others to comply in unison, immediately cease military actions, so that your esteemed government's orders can be implemented as soon as possible, the outline for governing Sichuan can be realized in a timely manner, and the remaining people can have the joy of rebirth and the defense against great disasters can be achieved together. I am filled with trepidation as I await your orders." (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Expanding the Women's Relief for the Northeast Movement</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Recently, Madame Li Jishen, Madame Wang Chonghui, and others, in view of the arduous struggles of the Northeastern Volunteer Army and the tragic experiences of the Northeastern refugees, specially initiated the organization of the Chinese Women's Relief for the Northeast Association to carry out the work of assisting the Northeastern Volunteer Army and relieving the Northeastern refugees. In the silent women's circles, the emergence of this movement with great significance is a phenomenon that we cannot but regard as extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since the loss of the Northeast. Over the past year, the cries of pain and the heroic struggles, based on past facts, do not seem to have aroused much response among the women's masses. Among them, there still seem to be some ladies and misses who believe that all of this has nothing to do with them. Even if the country is destroyed and the family is broken, they can still sing the licentious tune of "Hou Ting Hua."</p>
<p>The cold wind has risen, especially in the early cold of the border regions. At this time, it has long become a world of ice and snow. In the world of ice and snow, for the survival of the nation, the volunteer army is enduring the cold, enduring the hunger, and holding the cold iron, fighting to the death and engaging in arduous battles with the powerful enemy. The refugees outside the pass, before the country is destroyed, become slaves first, and are groaning under the iron hooves of the powerful enemy, struggling for their last breath. However, some pampered ladies and misses are already wrapped in warm wool and fur coats, preparing champagne and waiting for the early snow to arrive. All that the faces of the Northeastern Volunteer Army have is ice and snow, while all that the faces of some ladies and misses have is noble Parisian powder and rouge. All that the Northeastern Volunteer Army holds in their hands is cold iron, while all that some ladies and misses have on their hands is noble gloves. The Northeastern Volunteer Army struggles for life and death with flesh and blood day and night, while some ladies and misses are long intoxicated in the wine-red and green-lit cinema halls and dance halls. Under these two comparisons, can these ladies and misses not be moved? Can they not be ashamed and unable to find a place to hide?</p>
<p>If we say that the population of China is 400 million, then the number of women should be 200 million. Gathering 200 million people, and those who are called ladies and misses mostly use applying rouge and powder as their life, and do not pay attention to the survival of the country and the safety of the nation. Is this not a great shame for the women's masses?</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that this relief for the Northeast movement initiated by the women's circles this time is extremely meaningful. We believe that this movement should be intensified and expanded. All the ladies and misses should save the waste of Parisian powder and rouge, save the waste in dance halls and cinema halls, save the waste of fashionable clothing and all luxury lives, and donate it to the Northeastern Volunteer Army to relieve the Northeastern refugees. Every woman should have this understanding, should have this determination.</p>
<p>This is not saving others, it is saving our nation, saving ourselves. We are all citizens of the Republic of China and should all share a citizen's obligations. All the ladies and misses, quickly wake up from the luxurious and comfortable life.</p>

<h3>The European War Debt Problem Affects the Sino-Japanese Incident</h3>
<p>| Talk by a Certain Important Person in Diplomatic Circles |</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in diplomatic circles said that the special meeting of the League of Nations is scheduled to open on the 6th. It is expected that it will still be difficult to make a concrete decision on the Sino-Japanese incident, because there is currently an important issue in the international community that seems to be unrelated to the Sino-Japanese incident on the surface, but in fact, whether the attitude of the European powers towards the Sino-Japanese incident is consistent with that of the United States depends on whether this issue can be resolved. Before this issue is resolved, the major powers of Britain and France will not be able to make a firm and concrete expression. What is this issue? It is the issue of compensation and war debts. Since the European War, there are a total of twenty-eight countries in the world that have a direct relationship with this issue. There are five creditor countries, ten debtor countries, and thirteen countries that are both creditor and debtor, amounting to 700 million gold dollars. The major creditor country is the United States. The amount due from Britain to the United States this month is 90 million gold dollars, and the amount due from France is 20 million gold dollars. Due to various difficulties, Britain has officially requested a delay or suspension of payment, and France has more frankly said that it cannot pay as scheduled due to the emptiness of the national treasury. However, the United States still insists that it must be paid. This issue is now very tense. If it cannot be resolved within the next ten days, a major dispute will inevitably arise between the United States and the European powers. Once the dispute arises, although the attitude of various countries towards the Far East incident will not be completely different, it will inevitably be affected. Japan has repeatedly promoted that the major powers of Britain and France will not make a clear expression at the special meeting of the League of Nations, which may be based on this. We very much hope that this kind of problem can be solved appropriately. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Celebrates Fourth Anniversary</h3>
<p>Held a Total of 214 General Meetings</p>
<p>Passed Over a Thousand Resolutions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a ceremony to commemorate its fourth anniversary at 11:00 AM on the 5th. Central representatives Ju Zheng, Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen, and over 300 staff and guests attended. Chairman Shao Yuanchong delivered a report, stating that the Yuan had been established on the model of the late President Hu and he had inherited the legacy, and with the efforts of colleagues, the work had progressed gradually. In total, 214 general meetings were held in the past four years, including 40 this year. Over 1,000 resolutions were passed, with 412 types of laws and regulations comprising approximately 10,000 articles. As the Yuan also possesses academic characteristics, the work guidelines emphasize scientific and academic approaches to achieve the goal of national and ethnic construction. Central Standing Committee member Ju Zheng gave a speech, stating that since the establishment of the Legislative Yuan in the 17th year, due to the efforts of Hu and Shao, excellent results had been achieved, which the Central Committee was very satisfied with. Under party governance, the Legislative Yuan must base its work on the party's political program and policies. Therefore, the Central Political Council decided on legislative principles when drafting new laws. In addition, attention must be paid to the actual environment and good customs, so that legislation can meet social needs. On the occasion of the fourth anniversary, he encouraged the Legislative Yuan to promote the spirit of party governance and adapt to social customs. Chairman Lin of the National Government delivered a speech, stating that the Legislative Yuan occupies an extremely important position among the five Yuans, and the late Premier Sun Yat-sen attached great importance to it. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment in the 17th year, Mr. Hu Zhantang was specially invited to serve as President. Thanks to the efforts of the Legislative Yuan over the past four years, national order has gradually become stable. He hopes that in the future, the Legislative Yuan will formulate a constitutional outline based on the party's program to protect civil rights. He congratulated the Legislative Yuan on its boundless progress. Following this, the heads of the Legislative Committee, Wang Yongbin, the Foreign Affairs Committee, Lou Tongsheng, the Finance Committee, Chen Changheng, the Economic Committee, Ma Yinchu, the Military Affairs Committee, Niu Yongjian, and the heads of various committees and offices delivered speeches.

<h3>Strange Bandits Cracked Down on in Jinan</h3>
<p>▼Claim to be the Heavenly Emperor, Earthly Emperor, and Human Emperor</p>
<p>▼Puyi Allegedly Sent Someone to Connect and Govern</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Public Security Bureau cracked down on a group of strange bandits yesterday claiming to be the Heavenly Emperor, Earthly Emperor, and Human Emperor. According to the confession of the false Heavenly Emperor, Li Lechuan, the "Tui Bei Tu" predicts that the "Eighteen Sons" will be the emperor, and since his surname is Li, he should comply with the celestial phenomena and start a rebellion. Emperor Xuantong once sent someone to make contact, saying that Japan could supply guns and cannons. The false Empress Song Wangshi, the false Earthly Emperor Fu Baoziqi, and the carpenter Zhi Baoqing, who made the divine ox, firmly denied the claims. The two false palace ladies of the East and West, and the false Human Emperor Wang, have not yet been captured. The palace ladies are said to take turns serving the Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Emperors, supposedly to replenish yin and yang. Li's confession was also inconsistent.

<h3>Chen Gongbo Discusses that the Site of the Steel Plant Still Needs to Be Selected Separately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 4th and told people on the 5th that the contract for the Sino-German Central Iron and Steel Plant has not yet been signed. There are two reasons for this: 1) It is not known whether the coking coal at Leijiagou can be used for iron smelting. It is currently being chemically refined, and it is too uneconomical to purchase from abroad. 2) The site was originally surveyed at Pukou, but it is not a completely safe area, and the transportation to Ma'anshan is also inconvenient. It is now planned to select a better location, and then a contract can be signed with the German merchants. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Hungry People Gather in Washington as US Congress Opens</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Bills Awaiting Discussion</p>
<p>The Philippine Independence Bill to be First on the Agenda</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 4th. The US Congress will convene at noon tomorrow to discuss the most serious issues since the European War. After prayers, the House and Senate will proceed with the opening formalities and then begin legislative business. It is reported that over a hundred bills have been prepared by members of the House and will be successively introduced after the opening session. The following bills are planned to be introduced immediately after the opening of the House tomorrow: 1) An amendment to the Volstead Act to allow the sale and manufacture of beer containing 2.75% alcohol; 2) Convening a state convention to ultimately repeal the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution (i.e., lifting the alcohol ban); 3) Reducing letter postage from three cents to two cents; 4) Restricting the activities of the Federal Farm Board and prohibiting the use of public funds to maintain market prices; 5) Temporarily suspending payments on rural mortgages; 6) The US Shipping Board will permanently manage coastal and inland waterway transportation; 7) Thoroughly investigating the Treasury Department's refund of income taxes. Many bills have also been prepared in the Senate. The Philippine Independence Bill will be the first item on the agenda tomorrow. Although preparations have been made for the bill to lift the alcohol ban, it is unlikely to be brought up for discussion tomorrow.</p>
<h3>〓Hungry Petitioners Arrive in Washington〓</h3>
<p>Threatening to Destroy Congress</p>
<p>Will a Bloody Tragedy Be Repeated?</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th. The first group of unemployed petitioners, about 1,000 people, arrived here this afternoon by car. As they arrived, a police squad of about 150 officers greeted them and led them to a temporary camp in the woods near the railway. The area had been pre-cordoned off with ropes, and the police tricked the petitioners into the enclosure, preventing them from leaving. Despite being hungry and cold, the petitioners still sang the Internationale. Their leader, a man named Panchming, gave an angry speech to the police and journalists, stating, "We will destroy Congress, we will use force to break into the halls of Congress. If they do not accept our demands, we will riot. If Hoover calls in the army, bloodshed will be inevitable." This petition group is well-organized and has some cash. In addition, a petition group of about 1,500 people has been driven out of Cumberland, Maryland, by the "citizen army." The petition group in that area, due to a lack of food and housing, had internal conflicts and attacked their leader. Therefore, the "citizen army" of the city drove out the entire petition group and placed them in a 16-acre field to sleep outdoors. There is a six-room farmhouse in the enclosure, which is now used as housing for the women and children of the petition group.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 4th. Hungry petitioners and disgruntled farmers arrived in Washington today to petition Congress. The farmer representatives are temporarily staying in empty warehouses and the homes of friends. The hungry petitioners first marched through the streets and in the evening, most of them were housed in the Fort Myer barracks, which was allocated by the authorities on the condition that they maintain order, otherwise they would be expelled. Their numbers are still difficult to estimate. According to the police patrolling the parade ground in front of the barracks, there are at least 2,500 people, including several women. In addition, there are those who have rented cheap inns and dormitories in the downtown area, preparing to join the march tomorrow. Police Commissioner Fang advised the leaders of the petition group to send a few representatives to meet with the speakers of both houses of Congress tomorrow to present their demands. However, no agreement has yet been reached. The farmer representatives do not intend to take demonstrative actions, but only to organize a National Farmers Relief Conference in Washington to discuss and pass resolutions to send to Congress. These are all officially elected representatives of farmers' groups from various regions, including several who joined the withholding of grain movement this summer. However, they expressed sympathy for the hungry petitioners.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 4th. Three groups of hungry petitioners will arrive in Washington today, one from the South, one from the North, and one from the West, all heading towards the capital. They are said to be orderly, but the authorities are concerned about unexpected incidents and have divided the police into three teams, preparing to suppress them separately to prevent disturbances on the opening day of Congress. However, some officials today advocated allowing them to enter Washington and send representatives to Congress to petition for unemployment relief, but the regulations for assembling and marching will be strictly enforced. If the hungry petitioners are determined to march past Congress, a large armed force will be dispatched to guard and suppress them. Police Commissioner Blancard has served in the police force for forty years and is confident that his police force is sufficient to deal with the situation and that the situation is not worrying. He has made extensive preparations to prevent disturbances.</p>
<h3>〓Disturbances Also Arise Among Mexican Hungry People〓</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Veracruz, 4th. Mexico also has a hungry petition group today, with twice as many people as in the United States. This morning, more than 5,000 hungry men and women marched to the state capital, causing disturbances and attempting to enter the governor's office. More than 60 people were arrested by the police.</p>
<h3>〓The United States Is Willing to Make Concessions on War Debts〓</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th. According to a Washington dispatch from a New York newspaper, the US authorities are now considering the possibility of facilitating Britain's repayment of the debt due on December 15. According to dispatches from Washington, leading bankers have advised the government to grant a grace period. President Hoover, Treasury Secretary Mills, and Secretary of State Stimson met all day today to find a way to avoid the crisis on December 15.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th. The United States criticized the British and French governments' responses regarding the deferral of war debts, focusing its attack on European military expenditures. Gore, who served as a state official in President Wilson's government, issued a suggestion today that war debts should be repaid with international bonds, and these bonds should be guaranteed by the debtor countries in proportion to their military expenditures. Senator Somers, chairman of the Senate Monetary Committee, advocated using the war debt issue to increase the price of silver, saying that the United States might as well use silver to pay off the December debt, in order to solve the future market depression.</p>
<h3>〓Even the First Metropolis Is Running Out of Money〓</h3>
<p>New York's Finances Running Dry</p>
<p>Police Salaries in Jeopardy</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 4th. New York City is the richest city in the world, but under the current circumstances, the salaries of municipal government employees and police officers on the 15th of this month may not be paid due to a lack of funds. The banks believe that the city's treasury is already heavily indebted and will not grant loans unless the municipal government greatly reduces government spending. Acting Mayor McKee has already begun to reduce government spending and has submitted a bill to reduce government spending to the state legislature, but the bill has not yet been passed, and the banks are hesitating to provide loans. The authorities are deeply concerned that after the salaries are in arrears, the police will become as undisciplined as the police in Chicago after their salaries were in arrears.</p>
<h3>〓The Philippine Islands Convene a Special Congress〓</h3>
<p>Tax Laws Will Be Amended</p>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 5th. The Governor of the Philippine Islands has ordered the convening of a special session of the legislature to correct the errors in the legislative bills passed last time, especially the tax laws, because the hasty passage last time resulted in many errors in the general tax table, such as the cotton tax being completely forgotten.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Disarmament Negotiations Are Bleak</h3>
<p>France Remains Firm on Its Demand for Equality with Germany</p>
<p>MacDonald's Efforts at Mediation Have Been Fruitless</p>
<p>The International Disarmament Conference Is Likely to Be Suspended Indefinitely</p>
<p>Even if a Draft Treaty Can Be Concluded, It Will Be Worthless</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 4th. The League of Nations is becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future of disarmament issues, because according to leaked secret information, the talks between the British Prime Minister and the French Premier have been fruitless, because France refuses to make any concessions on Germany's demand for equality in armaments, and the British Prime Minister's efforts have been to no avail. It is also reported that the British Prime Minister said that "Christmas is just around the corner, and all peoples in the world should forget their hatred and engage in the promotion of friendship, so the authorities in France should also quickly adopt bold and far-reaching plans." Looking at the current situation, although German Foreign Minister Neurath has gone to Geneva from Berlin, the five-nation meeting scheduled for Sunday is unlikely to have a satisfactory outcome. Based on the general observations of observers here, the future of the conference is extremely hopeless. What is noteworthy is how the League of Nations will deal with the aftermath. Will the Disarmament Conference be suspended indefinitely thereafter, or will a draft treaty be drawn up in accordance with the US proposal to first establish the minimal effects that this conference has already achieved, but even if this draft treaty can be concluded, its value is virtually nil.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 4th. According to Geneva news, the Disarmament Conference may be postponed indefinitely to cover up its complete failure. The political circles here have expressed strong protests against this, saying that Herriot will still insist that the Disarmament Conference should discuss France's disarmament security plan, even if Germany does not return to the meeting. Herriot will also vigorously oppose British Prime Minister MacDonald's view that the life or death of the Disarmament Conference depends on whether Germany returns to the meeting. Italy's representative is also the same as Britain. Now the only fear is that Herriot will refuse to make any concessions to Germany and insist that the issue of equality of status must be mentioned after the end of the conference and cannot be used as a condition for participating in the conference. If this is the case, it will be a fatal blow to the conference.</p>
<h3>Davis Actively Engaged</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 4th. Davis, the US representative participating in the Disarmament Conference and the World Economic Conference in Europe, is now very active in promoting the US proposal to suspend the Disarmament Conference. The United States proposes that all principles that all parties can agree on should be included in a document and signed before December 15. The abolition of chemical and mold warfare, the restriction of cannons and tanks, and the prohibition of large-scale bombing of undefended towns must all be included. This is a temporary convention, supplemented by a permanent supervisory committee, which should meet on the 15th of this month and complete its work before the next Easter. This temporary convention will be the first stage of disarmament and will be valid until April 1937, so that it will expire at the same time as the Washington Naval Treaty. The Supervisory Committee will discuss the second stage of disarmament and draw up an agreement that includes all US proposals. The recognition of Germany's equality in armaments also contains restrictions on the implementation of equality in armaments. The above is the US proposal. Although there is no indication in the US proposal to exchange disarmament for war debt concessions, it is noteworthy that Davis is eager to sign this requirement before December 15.</p>
<p>December 15 is the date on which war debts are due. The intention is to ease the attitude of US congressmen, who are very dissatisfied with Europe's huge military spending, towards war debts. French Premier Herriot is scheduled to return to Paris from Geneva on Tuesday, and it seems that the German Foreign Minister Neurath, who will arrive here on Sunday, may not be able to agree on their outstanding issues.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Pending Issues Are Difficult to Compromise</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 4th. German Foreign Minister Neurath left for Geneva tonight to attend the five-nation meeting, but political circles in Berlin have very little hope for the meeting because France has not prepared to abandon its unwillingness to accept Germany's concept of equality.</p>
<h3>Japan Presents New Plan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Disarmament Representative Tsuno, on the 4th in Geneva, presented Japan's disarmament plan to the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries. Its content is as follows: 1) This conference cannot be bound by the Washington and London treaties; 2) The reduction of armaments should be based on the current strength; 3) The reduction of offensive ship types should be the main focus. This method makes Japan sacrifice more and other countries sacrifice less, so the tonnage of each battleship should be reduced to 25,000 tons, and the caliber of the guns should be reduced to 14 inches; 4) The ratio of Japan to the United States for battleships and cruisers with 8-inch guns must be more than 70%; 5) Japan supports the complete abolition of aircraft carriers or the reduction of their tonnage; 6) Japan opposes the complete abolition of submarines.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 5th. The Japanese representative to the Disarmament Conference formally notified the signatory countries of the Washington and London Naval Treaties of the basic principles of Japan's naval disarmament proposal. There are four main points: 1) The single tonnage of battleships should be reduced from 35,000 tons to 25,000 tons; 2) Aircraft carriers should be prohibited or their tonnage reduced; 3) Cruisers should retain 8-inch guns; 4) Submarines should be retained.</p>
<h3>Italy Adds Two New Ships</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 4th. It is firmly denied here that Mussolini ordered the construction of two 7,000-ton cruisers because he was dissatisfied with France's continued construction of the new cruiser "Dunkerque." According to official sources, the French government's continued construction of ships has indeed made the Italian government dissatisfied, but Italy's construction of two cruisers is actually part of Italy's shipbuilding plan to replace old ships, and it is not aimed at France. It is reported that both new Italian ships are equipped with 6-inch guns.</p>
<h3>The Interlocking Relationship Between the Manchurian Question, War Debts, and Disarmament</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Claims U.S. Using War Debt Issue</p>
<p>To Break the Diplomatic Alliance of Britain, France, and Japan</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th -- The "Pravda" newspaper here today published an article discussing the second war debt note sent by Britain and France to the U.S., stating that war debts are not merely an economic issue, but a political one. The U.S. is allegedly using this to exert pressure on its competitors and break the diplomatic alliance between Britain, France, and Japan. The newspaper claims the British note's assertion that "the economic prosperity from 1923 to 1929 was illusory" is quite accurate. It argues that the heavy burden of war debt repayments would strike a blow to the finances and commerce of European nations, intensifying market competition, leading to a drop in the pound's value, higher prices, wage cuts, and increased internal instability in Britain. However, in this note, the British Empire, besides acknowledging its own weakness, also undisguisedly threatened the U.S., saying that any blow to the British economy would directly affect the U.S. economy. This point indicates that Downing Street and the Quai d'Orsay had already been in contact before the British note was issued, so the reasons given in the British and French notes, though different, are only formally different in diplomacy. Furthermore, the failure to give the same reasons also avoids arousing the fear among American creditors of a "European common front." However, there is indeed no common front in Europe, as Germany and Italy are now each going their own way. The newspaper concludes by saying that the antagonism among the powers is now becoming increasingly acute, and the issues of war debts, disarmament, and the Manchurian question are all closely interlinked and cannot be resolved separately.</p>

<h3>New German Cabinet to Moderate Parliamentary Policies</h3>
<p>Intends to Revoke Certain Substitute Decrees</p>
<p>To Win the Favor of the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th -- The German parliament is scheduled to convene on Tuesday. The Schleicher cabinet has quickly assembled to discuss how to deal with parliamentary issues. If all parties involved can refrain from voting for a motion of no confidence, the new government's future policies will likely be postponed for announcement until after Christmas. It is expected that Schleicher will express his intention to revoke certain social and political plans from the recent presidential decrees issued to prevent riots, in order to first win the favor of the Social Democratic Party or the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cologne, 4th -- Approximately two hundred members of the National Socialist Party, wearing uniforms, marched in formation on the outskirts of the town of Duisburg. They encountered a group of Republicans of similar size, leading to a conflict. Both sides clashed with batons and fired several gunshots. Thirteen people were seriously injured, and many others sustained minor injuries. Fortunately, no one died.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- The Naval Ministry announced that, according to a telegram from the Commander of the Mako Naval Base, the destroyer "Hayasuzuki," while returning to the Mako Naval Base from the Kure Naval Port, was caught in a storm and drifted in the sea about one hundred miles north of Baogui Cape, the northern tip of Taiwan, at 2:00 PM on the 5th. Three accompanying ships braved the waves to attempt rescue, and fourteen people were rescued by 5:00 PM. The Mako Naval Base immediately dispatched the cruisers "Kitakami" and "Isuzu" to assist in the rescue. The rescue is currently underway. The "Hayasuzuki" was built at the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Yard in December of Taisho 10 (1921), launched in September of Taisho 11 (1922), has a main gun of 12.3 inches, a speed of 31.5 knots, and a displacement of 900 tons.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government's Difficulties in the Upcoming Parliament</h3>
<p>The National League Prepares a Fierce Attack from the Position of the Opposition Party</p>
<p>The Upper House Attaches Great Importance to the Red Scare Incident of Judicial Officials</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- The Japanese parliament is scheduled to convene on December 24th, with the opening ceremony held on the 26th. The Seiyukai, Minseito, and National League are all holding daily leadership meetings to discuss countermeasures. The National League has decided to adopt an aggressive strategy from the position of the opposition party. The Minseito has decided to support the government, but the Seiyukai is hesitant. The various factions of the Upper House will attack the government on the following five major issues, with particular attention paid to the issue of judicial officials participating in the Communist Party: (1) the issue of reorganizing the bankrupt budget; (2) exchange rate countermeasures and managed trade; (3) continued financial resources for military spending; (4) policies toward Manchuria and policies toward the League of Nations; (5) the question of who bears responsibility for the participation of judicial officials Ozaki and Sakamoto in the Communist movement to overthrow Japanese groups.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- The National League is scheduled to hold its founding ceremony at the Hibiya Public Hall on the 22nd, and to hold its first meeting of members after the founding on the 23rd, to consolidate its ranks in preparation for the 64th Parliament. It is reported that although the party's policy is to be a minority party, it will adopt a purely opposition stance and take an independent attitude for all its activities. That is to say, the next year's budget lists vast numbers, and the situation rescue also violates the statements of the provisional parliament. Because of the drastic decline in the exchange rate and the expansionary policy, prices are rising, and national life is facing unprecedented anxiety. Although the government claims that it will reorganize the financial and tax system to compensate for these shortcomings, it is too foolish to say that merely reorganizing the financial and tax system can remove these fundamental anxieties. Judging from the government's intentions, it merely wants to use this to get through the parliamentary difficulties. As for the ideological aspect, it is also an unprecedentedly major issue. There is the issue related to the [illegible] incident of incumbent judges. On the one hand, regarding the Manchurian policy and diplomacy, the entire country has demands on the current government. In short, such a situation cannot be opened up and rescued by superficial means such as the technicalization of finance and administration; it truly requires fundamental political and economic reforms. This is the attitude held by the National League. From this perspective, it will deal a painful blow to the government whenever it has the opportunity. On the other hand, it will pay close attention to the attitudes of the Seiyukai and Minseito and seek countermeasures to adapt to the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- This morning, Justice Minister Oyama visited Prime Minister Saito to discuss the matter of the "Manchukuo" recruiting Japanese judicial officials, and also frankly discussed the issue of responsibility for the unfortunate incident that occurred in the Ministry of Justice. Mr. Oyama believes that the Minister of Justice should not be held responsible, but since the full picture of the incident has not yet been investigated, it seems too early to decide on an attitude. He also said that it would not be too late to decide on an attitude after a thorough investigation. Prime Minister Saito also deeply understood this.</p>
<h3>Trotsky Secretly Returns to Paris</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency China-Japan, Paris -- Trotsky, using the name Sedov, arrived in Dunkirk today with his wife and three secretaries aboard a Danish ship, and then traveled here by train. The police have again increased their precautions against opponents of Trotsky engaging in demonstrations. Trotsky originally intended to reside in Denmark for a long time, so he and his wife had found a house in the Danish countryside, intending to purchase it if the Danish government allowed it, but it was ultimately rejected, reportedly out of fear of offending the Soviet Russian government. Trotsky's desire to move to Denmark was ostensibly because he wanted to consult the famous library in Copenhagen for his writing, but in reality, he wanted to be in closer contact with the development of Russian affairs. It is expected that Trotsky will soon return to Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), where he previously resided.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers' Corpses Arrive One After Another</h3>
<p>▲ China United News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- Japanese newspapers report daily on the smooth progress of operations in the Three Eastern Provinces to reassure the people at home, but troop ships carrying corpses continue to arrive one after another. Yesterday, another 224 corpses of fallen soldiers arrived in Moji and were sent to their respective units for burial.</p>
<h3>The Manchurian Question and Representatives of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The Spanish representative, Madariaga, and the Czechoslovakian representative, Beneš, are the vanguards of anti-Japanese sentiment among the small countries. Madariaga, currently 46 years old, initially worked in the railway industry, then served as the chief editor of literary reviews in London. Ten years ago, he served as a member of the press department of the League of Nations Secretariat, Minister of Disarmament, and Director-General of the International Conference on the Management of Military Supplies Trade. He is brave, astute, and has made great contributions to the disarmament cause. In April 1931, he served as the first ambassador of the Spanish Republic to the United States, and is currently the ambassador to France. He is proficient in English, French, and several other languages, and his sharp tongue has been exceptionally forceful in refuting Japan during the League Council meetings. Therefore, the Japanese deeply resent him and call him the "Head of the Mouse." Beneš is a famous European diplomat and an economist. Since the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1928, he has served as the Foreign Minister to this day. He is fully aware of all the events and all the large and small issues that have occurred in Europe after the Great War. He and President Masaryk are known in Europe for their intelligence and competence. Currently 48 years old, his lifelong advocacy is to devote himself to the completion of European peace mechanisms. However, he is close to France because he has to cooperate with France in order to maintain the peace organization in Central Europe. On the one hand, he also woos the United Kingdom and France to jointly maintain the political and economic interests of Europe. If the United Kingdom and France have disputes, Beneš will step in to mediate, so he is trusted by the authorities in the United Kingdom and France. Since 1923, he has led the small countries in striving for European peace. At the Council meeting on the 25th of last month, Beneš advocated entrusting the entire Manchurian issue to a special assembly, using a simple method of deliberation, and reserving the right to state his opinions at the assembly. As soon as the representatives of various countries heard his words, the United Kingdom happily agreed, and Japan's opposition to the proposal to transfer the issue to the assembly completely failed. This must be attributed to the fact that Beneš has always been trusted by various countries.</p>
<p>Hymans, the President of the Council and Belgian Foreign Minister, is known to all in European diplomatic circles. He is a veteran in the European diplomatic field, and drafted the articles of the League of Nations. After the European War, he attended the Paris Peace Conference, and his tactful and smooth diplomatic skills won him the sympathy of various countries. He served as the President of the first League of Nations General Assembly. Whenever there is an international conference, he is invited to attend and provide assistance. He has made great efforts in resolving major diplomatic issues such as the Ruhr Question, the Trieste Question, the Security Treaty, and the Customs Agreement. The Customs Agreement was originally created by him. He comes from a famous Belgian family, has served as a member of the Belgian Parliament, and is proficient in literature. From 1898 to 1914, he served as a professor at the Free University of Brussels, earning the honor of a doctorate in the history of parliamentary law. He has written extensively and is respected by the representatives of the League. How the Manchurian question will be resolved is closely related to him, as his every word and action is sufficient to influence the views of the representatives of the League. He uses a liberal worldview to distinguish right from wrong, and his actions are in accordance with reason and emotion. He pays attention to the attitude of the United Kingdom towards the Manchurian question, but whether the United Kingdom can uphold justice, given the failure of the Republican Party in the United States elections, the increasing demand for German military parity, and the annual payment of 1.5 million yuan to the League, among other factors, is still questionable. However, as far as the opinions of Drummond, Lytton, and Simon, the three major figures of the United Kingdom in the League, are concerned, their views are largely the same, and Lytton, as the chairman of the investigation committee, has to uphold his own national dignity and deal with the matter fairly. This time, the Manchurian question will be deliberated according to Article 15 of the Covenant, first through a resolution of the Committee of Nineteen, and then voted on by the General Assembly. However, judging from the situation of the resolution of the Provisional Assembly on March 3rd, among the small countries, such as Spain, Panama, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other representatives, and the committee members from Switzerland, Colombia, Hungary, Sweden, and Turkey, nine out of ten are anti-Japanese. Although the major countries dare not offend Japan, Japan has fallen into a desperate situation of isolation and helplessness. This is why the Japanese government is unusually embarrassed and threatens to withdraw. At the welcome reception, Matsuoka, the plenipotentiary, even declared, "If Japan's claims are not implemented, kill me to show Japan's determination." Such threatening words are almost identical to Uchida's statement that "I would rather turn the whole of Japan into scorched earth than give up Manchuria." I do not know if the various countries will be intimidated by this. (End)</p>
<p>The attitudes of the representatives of the major countries are roughly on the one hand to maintain the authority of the League, on the other hand to appease the dissatisfaction of the small countries, and at the same time to fear Japan's strength and consider its face. Because Japan is threatening to withdraw from the League, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and other countries are making great efforts to accommodate Japan on the Manchurian question because of war debts and military parity issues. However, the small countries believe that Japan has clearly violated the Covenant and strongly advocate sanctions, and hope that Japan will withdraw so that they can maintain the League's functions in the future.</p>
<p>Among the major countries, France's pro-Japanese color is relatively clear. France and Japan have long had a tacit understanding. The two representatives of France in the Council, one is General Peng Gu, Chief of the Army, and the other is General Krowatt of the investigation committee. These two will largely follow Japan's intentions. When Mr. Krowatt attended the Council meeting last month, he was still protecting Japan, as he had done in Beiping. At the meeting of the investigation committee on the 24th of last month, he opposed Lytton's advance. He said that Lytton had not consulted with the investigation committee beforehand and could not speak freely in the Council. This is enough to count the attitude of France. Mr. Chak is 61 years old and served as a military attaché at the French Embassy in China. When the investigation team was preparing its report in Beiping, the members were generally dissatisfied with Japan. The content of the report was mostly unfavorable to Japan, but due to Mr. Chak's opposition, it was revised several times. As for Peng Gu, although he has unspeakable difficulties in French policy and international relations, he originally came from the Socialist Party and has always advocated fairness, and regards the League as the supreme and inviolable. In addition, various environments and circumstances make it inconvenient to openly show a pro-Japanese attitude. However, the French government has expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. war debt issue, so France is bound to change its attitude towards the Manchurian question. It is said that French Prime Minister Herriot will personally appear at the General Assembly on the 6th. Herriot was originally the son of a poor soldier and graduated from the Higher Normal School. He is a famous practical politician in Europe. He will shift with the attitude of the United States. If the United States does not change its original position, Herriot will definitely not be confused by Japan. As for the United Kingdom, in addition to the Conservative Party, the Liberal and Labor Parties are very anti-Japanese. Their representative, Foreign Minister Simon, is a passionate and practical member of the Liberal Party. He graduated from Oxford University, is 58 years old, initially worked as a lawyer, is famous in the British legal world, and later served as the head of the Attorney General's Office and the Home Secretary. In 1929, he served as the chairman of the Indian Constitutional Investigation Committee. The so-called Simon Report shocked the entire Europe. Although he has not yet clearly expressed his anti-Japanese sentiment on the Manchurian question, he will definitely follow the Liberal Party's intentions and implement his主張. Next is Italy. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has already expressed his intentions in his speech, but Italy has little interest in the Far East, so it does not want to offend Japan. Therefore, it is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude. The representative of the Netherlands is Foreign Minister Arocho, who served as the ambassador to Japan and is regarded by the Japanese as a pro-Japanese figure. Next is Germany. Germany is preoccupied with the issue of military parity and has no time to consider the Eastern Incident. In addition, with the resignation of the Papen cabinet and the beginning of the Schleicher cabinet, it is unpredictable whether it will be able to uphold justice in its own relationship. As for League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, who is now 57 years old, served as the secretary of Lord Balfour, the British representative, during the Versailles Peace Conference. He is quite fair in handling affairs. This time, he has spared no effort in transferring the Manchurian question to the General Assembly and in mediating private negotiations. Although he has the power to manipulate the meeting, he dares not openly protect one side due to the extremely complex international political situation. The most noteworthy thing at the moment is the United States. With the victory of the Democratic Party in the United States elections, its representative, Davis, proposed a constructive settlement plan in order to avoid a frontal conflict between Japan and the major countries concerned. According to Japanese newspapers, Davis's so-called constructive settlement plan is that, on the one hand, it formally recognizes the existence of Manchukuo, and on the other hand, it reserves China's sovereignty.</p>
<p>Appendix: Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke is from Murozumi Port, Kumage District, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. His father, Sanjuro, runs a fish business. Matsuoka was known as the "Hungry Ghost General" in his childhood. After graduating from elementary school, his father's Imatsu Seigyogyo went bankrupt, and his family situation became even more difficult. At the age of thirteen, he went to the United States with the son of his fellow villager, Fujiyama Motosaburo, and worked as a school tea servant and translator, studying diligently and striving hard. After returning to Japan, he was promoted by Yamamoto Jotaro and gradually began to show his talent. Matsuoka has a mother, who is 88 years old, a sister named Matsueda, who is 56 years old, and a wife named Naboi, who is 36, with four sons and one daughter. When he arrived in Geneva last month, he made a grandiose speech at the welcome reception, saying, "If the countries in the League meeting do not accept the opinions of the Japanese government on the Manchurian question, I would rather assassinate Matsuoka to implement Japan's claims." Such barbaric and unreasonable words are almost identical to Uchida's so-called "I would rather turn the whole of Japan into scorched earth than be willing to give up Manchuria." I do not know if the various countries will be intimidated by him.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Palace Museum's Sale of Objects Completed</h3>
<p>Supervisory Committee Members Gao and Zhou Have Left Beiping One After Another</p>
<p>The Results of the Investigation Will Be Released After Being Submitted</p>
<p>Beiping News: Supervisory Committee members Gao Lu and Zhou Lisheng, who came to Beiping to investigate the Palace Museum's sale of objects, have recently completed their investigation. Gao Lu left Beiping for Qingdao a few days ago, and Zhou Lisheng also took the Beining train to Tianjin at 4:25 PM yesterday (the 1st). After reviewing the files related to the [illegible] catty price increase case, he will return to Nanjing as soon as possible to report to the Control Yuan. Beiping press circles had previously been promised by Gao and Zhou that they would release the results of the Palace Museum investigation before leaving Beiping after the investigation was completed. Yesterday, many people went to the Central Hotel to visit Zhou and inquire. Mr. Zhou suddenly said that according to the Control Yuan's practice, the results of the investigation of cases cannot be released to the public before being submitted to the Yuan. He then issued a written statement and handed it to the reporters for publication. Since the reporters could not hear the results of the investigation, they inquired about the progress of the investigation from Zhou. Zhou said that he and Mr. Gao Hanqing had been in Beiping for three weeks. Because the case was complicated, they conducted internal and external investigations. The internal investigation involved reviewing various related documents, including resolutions of the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Committee, documents submitted by the Yuan to the Executive Yuan when selling objects, and approvals from the Executive Yuan, and accounts of the sale of various objects and goldware. They either extracted original files or selected excerpts to be carried to the Control Yuan. The procedures of the Yuan for selling objects have been thoroughly investigated. Regarding the number of existing antiques, because there are a vast number of antiques, it is impossible to check them one by one. They have been checked using sampling methods. However, regarding the authenticity of the existing antiques, because examining authenticity involves expertise, they could not proceed and did not start the review. The external investigation has been conducted separately with the Yuan's supervisory committee, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, the Beiping Municipal Government, and the Beiping District Court. However, on the side of the Garrison Headquarters, although the Palace Museum recognized Yu Xiaohou (Xuezhong) as the Yuan's supervisory committee member, Mr. Yu strongly denied it to them. They also met with various directors of the Yuan and members of the Political Committee, such as Liu Zhe and Wang Shuhan, and investigated ancient dealers and gold shops that had purchased objects from the Yuan one by one, all of which yielded considerable results. To summarize the results of this investigation, what can be reported is: (1) The Yuan's procedures for selling objects are mostly flawed; (2) Various rumors from the outside cannot be substantiated with evidence. That's all. The written statement issued by Zhou is as follows: "Our mission to Beiping has been completed. Mr. Gao went to Qingdao the day before yesterday, and I also plan to go to Tianjin in a day or two. The investigation of the Palace Museum case has yielded considerable results, but the situation is complicated and cannot be fully explained in a few words. However, what the outside world criticizes about the Yuan includes things that are real and things that are unreal. After we return to Beijing, we will truthfully report and handle the matter in accordance with the law. The details can be made public to society in about two weeks. I am sorry that I cannot provide details at this moment. Zhou Lisheng, December 1st.</p>
<h3>Treasures in Dorgon's Tomb Stolen</h3>
<p>Dragon Spring Sword, Jade Cane, and Other Items Stolen Clean</p>
<p>The Leader of the Thieves Pretends to Be Sick and Flees to Beiping, Happening to Encounter the Victim</p>
<p>Beiping News: The theft of the tomb of Dorgon, the Regent Prince who founded the Qing Dynasty, by the local tyrant Bao Jintai in Changping County in collusion with Wang Fukun and others, has attracted considerable attention in society. The truth, according to the investigation, is as follows: Since Dorgon's tomb was stolen, the tomb owner Qi Liande was also brought in for questioning. After interrogation by Changping County, the leader of the thieves, Bao Jintai, and others confessed without denial. However, Bao Jintai, knowing that the case was serious, falsely claimed to be ill and requested permission to seek medical treatment outside on bail. The county government did not investigate deeply and granted bail. When the deadline for summons expired, Bao Jintai was evasive in every way and failed to appear after three summonses, secretly fleeing. The county government realized it had been fooled and was extremely alarmed by the seriousness of the case. It immediately detained the guarantor and strictly demanded that Bao Jintai be brought to justice. As soon as Bao Jintai heard of the strict arrest, he knew that it would be difficult to stand on his feet unless he fled far away. Therefore, on the tenth of last month, he secretly disguised himself and his family and took a long-distance bus to Beiping. It happened that Qi Liande, due to the county government's release of the leader of the thieves and the delay in dealing with the matter, returned to Beiping to file a complaint with the Military Commission branch and the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters. To his surprise, the enemy's road was narrow. Just as he boarded the bus, he caught a glimpse of Bao Jintai accompanied by women in the carriage, obviously fleeing to avoid punishment. At that time, he was afraid of alarming the thief and did not arrest him. When the bus arrived at Xizhimen, Qi Liande reported to the police and accused him. The gang police and others sent him to the district together for interrogation and then to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. However, Qi Liande had already filed a complaint with the Garrison Headquarters, requesting that the county be ordered to present the case to the Ministry for investigation. The original presentation is as follows: "The tombs of the princes and nobles within the ancestral tomb of Liande's ancestors are located in Shangzhuang Village, Changping County, with magnificent architecture and burial treasures, many of which are historical relics, and are the hereditary formula of the Liande family. Wang Tai, the weak tomb keeper, caused the local tycoon Bao Jintai and his sons Changren and Wang Fukun, Zhou Fu, Zhou San, etc. to steal. In the early part of the twelfth month of the old calendar last year, they colluded with Wei Yongfu, Bao Changqing and others to open up three tombs of Kuixu, Chengan, and Yulin, and stole all the sacrificial objects in the mausoleum and the treasures in the coffin. At that time, Liande was far away in Tianjin. After hearing the news, he immediately returned to Beiping and went to Changping County to verify that Bao was the accused, Bao Jintai, Bao Changren, Wang Fukun, Zhou Fu, Zhou San, etc. were captured and detained by the county. Wei Yongfu, Bao Changqing, etc. were hiding. After the county summoned witnesses and confirmed the facts, the accused also confessed to the tomb robbery. The stolen burial objects were reported to the county chief Zhang Shusen at the time, and it was informed that the defendants had stolen important treasures, including a historically famous Dragon Spring Sword, a transparent jade cane, a transparent jade white [illegible], two transparent jade flower pots, a set of pure gold five offerings, and a pair of jade lions and jade horses. Zhou Fu also confessed to having a sapphire tripod, but it has not been searched for. After a long delay, the main offender Bao Jintai was suddenly released in the seventh month of the old calendar this year, and the disaster struck again. Because Bao Jintai, once released, immediately led many people to continue to excavate the tombs of Nielehan and Harachun, stealing all the burial objects and sacrifices together. These local tycoons support the situation and are unwilling to give up their fierceness. If they are not severely punished, it will not be enough to maintain the rule of law and guarantee the future. Liande and others, descendants of the Eight Banners, are all grateful for the [illegible] and share the same fate as the Republic of China. They are heartbroken and saddened by the continuous excavation of their ancestors' tombs and the exposure of their bones. They can only request the Ministry to take charge of the maintenance and protection of the tombs for the future. It is hoped that Bao Jintai and others are all local tycoons in Changping. The county handling this case is afraid of taking into account the environment and cannot handle it thoroughly. It is hoped that the Ministry will take into account the word-of-mouth and the kindness of the flag people, and that no one will forget the benefits. They should report the facts and request that the previous case be brought to the Ministry, that the stolen goods be searched completely, and that they be handled in accordance with the law. In addition to the items that should be ordered to be led, all items related to history and culture, and the costs of repairing the tombs, should also be ordered to be compensated by the defendants in order to maintain the rule of law and serve as a warning. This is to the utmost gratitude and obedience."</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Rice Permit Tax Abolished</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The rice export permit tax established by the Anhui Provincial Government charged six jiao per dan of rice and four jiao for miscellaneous grains. A Rice Management Committee was established to oversee these matters. After its establishment, the committee appointed prominent Anhui figures such as Lu Zhongnong and Yu Youquan as directors of the rice tax bureaus in Dashengguan and other locations. However, Anhui natives, both inside and outside the province, protested against the rice tax, viewing it as harmful to merchants and farmers. Fellow villagers in Shanghai dispatched representatives to Wuhu, Anqing, Bengbu, and other places to unite with local communities and resolutely oppose it. It is now reported that the provincial authorities, recognizing the intense public sentiment and the central government's order to cease the tax, proposed a resolution at the provincial government's regular meeting on the second of this month to abolish the rice permit tax. The road construction expenses of this province will be compensated by a special fund allocated separately by the central government. Upon receiving this news, Li Yunqi, the chairman of the Wuhu Rice Management Committee, and committee member Cheng Fuchu, have independently submitted their resignations and requested the abolition of the Rice Management Committee. It is said that the total permit fees collected by various customs stations last month exceeded 400,000 yuan. (December 3rd)</p>
<h3>Planning the Construction of Railways in Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong Provinces</h3>
<p>Each province to send one member to the road construction committee.</p>
<p>Wang Xunzhi appointed as Guizhou's road construction member.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Before the political upheaval in Guizhou and Wang Jialie's departure, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong, with their interdependent relationship, actively pursued connections. Guizhou even sent representatives to Guangdong to foster friendship. The Southwest Political Affairs Committee, aiming to develop industries in the Southwest, facilitate transportation between the provinces, and strengthen border defense, proposed the construction of railways in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou. The plan involved the establishment of a joint Guangdong-Guangxi-Guizhou Road Construction Committee, with each province sending one member. This proposal was passed at the 41st meeting of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and distributed to the governments of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou for compliance, urging them to promptly dispatch personnel to promote its implementation. After receiving the order, the Guangdong Provincial Government wired the chairmen of the Guangxi and Guizhou provincial governments. Recently, a sudden change occurred in Guizhou, Wang Jialie has left his post, and Mao Guangxiang is in charge. The joint effort of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou is now missing Guizhou. However, Guangxi has not forgotten the three-province road construction matter and appointed Wang Xunzhi as a member of the three-province road construction committee, informing the Guangdong Provincial Government via telegram. The exchange of telegrams between Guangdong and Guangxi is attached as follows: 1. Guangdong Provincial Government's telegram to Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government and Chairman Wang of the Guangdong Provincial Government: "We have received Instruction No. 1679 from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government, stating that the 41st Political Affairs Committee meeting resolved to construct the Guizhou-Guangxi-Guangdong Railway, and the matter has been assigned to the governments of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou to determine the methods and establish a committee for preparation. In addition to distributing the order, we hereby instruct your provincial government to comply, properly plan, and report back." Signed by Lin Yunjie, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. 2. Guangxi Provincial Government's reply telegram to Chairman Lin of the Guangdong Provincial Government in Guangzhou: "We have received your respected telegram and understand the matter of constructing the Guizhou-Guangxi-Guangdong Railway to be handled by the three provincial governments of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou. We have just received the order from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government with the same content and are planning to discuss it. According to your telegram, we have appointed Wang Xunzhi as the preparatory committee member for this matter and have separately informed the member via telegram. We hereby inform you for your reference." Signed by Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government. (December 1st)</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Leads Troops to Suppress Fang Shao on Three Routes</h3>
<p>The 18th Army Recaptures Xuwan and Jinxi for the Second Time.</p>
<p>Zhou Hunyuan Cuts off Contact Between Zhu Mao and Fang Shao.</p>
<p>Wei Lihuang's Troops Arrive in Jiangxi Successively to Suppress Bandits.</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Communist bandits Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Luo Binghui, and Xiao Ke have connected with Fang Shao in northeastern Jiangxi, attempting to seize Fuzhou to threaten Nanchang. However, after Wu Qihui and Zhou Hunyuan recaptured Jinxi, and Sun Lianzhong repelled the bandit forces near Linchuan, Zhu Mao's rear was cut off, and Peng Dehuai was blocked in Nancheng and Nanfeng, unable to converge. Therefore, they retreated from Jinxi to Zixi, joining forces with Fang Shao in Guixi, reigniting their strength and recapturing Jinxi for the second time, counterattacking Xuwan. Fang Shao also attempted to invade Jinxian and Dongxiang from Guixi and Yujiang. After receiving this information, Commander-in-Chief Jiang telegraphed the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian border region in Nanchang, appointing Chen Cheng, commander of the 18th Army, as the front-line commander of the Fuzhou Red Army Suppression. Simultaneously, he telegraphed the 18th Army's Zhou Zhirou, the 4th Army's Wu Qihui, and the 10th Army's Li Mo'an, newly arrived from Wuhan, to concentrate in Fuzhou and advance towards Jinxi for suppression. Chen Cheng arrived in Fuzhou from Nanchang on the 1st, assuming the position of commander. In addition to the 26th Route Army's Sun Lianzhong's division firmly defending Fuzhou city with strict vigilance, the remaining divisions unanimously switched from defense to offense, searching and advancing. According to military news from Fuzhou, the 18th Army in the central route recaptured Xuwan Town, located at the junction of Linchuan and Jinxi, yesterday. Before leaving, the bandits kidnapped over seventy wealthy merchants from the town, demanding ransoms ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of yuan per person. After a brief deployment in Xuwan, the army is advancing towards Jincheng. The 4th Army on the right flank is attacking the bandits' left flank and has reached the west of Jinxi from Yiji. There are also reports of recapturing Jincheng yesterday. Zhou Hunyuan's troops on the left flank have returned to Guixi, cutting off the contact between Zhu Mao and Fang Shao. The situation in eastern Jiangxi has eased compared to before. The four main provincial roads, previously closed for military transport, have uniformly resumed operations since the 1st. As for the 10th Army's Wei Lihuang's troops and Li Mo'an's division, newly arrived in Jiangxi, they arrived in Wan at the end of last month and successively crossed the province to Fuzhou yesterday, advancing fiercely towards the front lines. The 83rd Division's Liu Kan's troops have also departed from Wuhan and will arrive shortly. The military strength in the Fu River area is over seven divisions. Mao Bingwen, Xu Kexiang, and Li Yunjie's divisions are stationed in Nancheng and Nanfeng. Zhu Mao is under attack from both front and rear and may also attempt to flee diagonally to the border area of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui. However, the headquarters of the three provinces has ordered Zhao Guantao, Wang Jinwen, Li Yunheng, Zhou Hunyuan, Ruan Zhaochang, and other troops in northeastern Jiangxi to be on strict alert. Regarding Commander-in-Chief Jiang's arrival in Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of bandits, the Welcome Preparation Committee and various public organizations have repeatedly telegraphed Han, requesting his early arrival. Jiang replied to the provincial party department yesterday, stating that he is deeply concerned about the suffering of the Jiangxi people and will inform them of the scheduled travel date after it is confirmed. It is rumored that Jiang fears that the bandit Xu's escape to Shaanxi may lead to further spread into Xinxing Mongolia, so he is determined to fundamentally resolve the issue in the shortest time possible to avoid losing all previous efforts. Therefore, the date of his arrival in Jiangxi is still after the Third Plenary Session. As for the suppression of bandits in this province, He Guoguang is temporarily responsible for the remaining matters, except for important ones, which will be reported to Jiang and He in Nanjing by telegram. Chen Cheng is in command of the military affairs in eastern Jiangxi. However, according to another source, when Jiang travels from Wuhan to Nanjing, he may stop in Nanchang or briefly delay in Wan to personally instruct senior generals. Therefore, the provincial government has changed the location to the Science Museum to prepare Jiang's headquarters. (December 2nd)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Rectifies His Troops</h3>
<p>Personally Inspects Returning Troops</p>
<p>Officer Promotions to Require Examinations</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Han Fuju believes that military discipline is most easily corrupted during troop operations, so the troops of the Third Route Army, after the recent Liaodong battle, need to be strictly rectified to become a strong national defense force. Therefore, he personally inspected each army after their return to Jinan from the front lines, which has already been completed. The cavalry brigade of Li Xuande's troops was the last to return to Jinan and was inspected today (3rd) at Zhangzhuang. This inspection was extremely thorough, with each person, horse, and weapon carefully checked. In addition, regular examinations are held, with company commanders and below tested on three sets of calisthenics and military spirit, among other things. Those who fail are immediately dismissed. Han Fuju also believes that quality is more important than quantity, so after returning from Jiaodong, he ordered that future soldier vacancies not be filled, and the old and weak be eliminated to save on military expenses. Promotions of officers in each division and brigade must be approved by Han himself in the province through examinations. Only those who pass are allowed to be promoted. (December 3rd)</p>

Otherwise, they threatened to kill the hostage. However, the Chen family is a rural farming family with no savings. Even if they sell all their property, they cannot meet this amount. Therefore, they have decided to sacrifice the hostage and have reported the original letter to the county government for thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Auditing the Handover of District Chiefs</p>
<p>The outgoing district chiefs of this county have mostly not completed the handover, which not only causes difficulties for the incoming chiefs but also easily leads to corruption in public funds.

Zhu is in his twilight years and is currently the director of the Suzhou-Wuxi Shipping Office and the chief of the Wuhe Township in the First District. There is only one wife and two daughters-in-law in the family. It is said that around twelve o'clock the night before, a large gang of forty to fifty bandits suddenly arrived, armed with pistols, wooden sticks, ropes, and other items. They first stationed sentries nearby, then broke down the door and rushed in, dragging Zhu's wife and others out of their beds, tying them up with ropes, burning their lower bodies with candles, and slashing their necks with kitchen knives, forcing them to reveal the location of the hidden silver. They then ransacked the boxes and cabinets, plundering at will. After about two hours, they left with their loot, including clothes, jewelry, silver coins, and other items, worth over a thousand yuan. Afterwards, neighbors untied the victims, compiled a list of losses, and reported to the county government, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Conflict Between Finance and Education Chiefs</p>
<p>The Jiangdu government has seen a significant decrease in revenue since the autumn floods. Therefore, the various agencies that draw funds from local taxes have been subject to repeated cuts, and many are unable to receive their payments on time. Among them, the education funds have been in the most arrears. Director Xu of the Education Bureau, feeling deeply the difficulty of funding, has repeatedly settled accounts with the Finance Bureau. The Education Bureau believes that the funds that should have been received are often diverted by the Finance Bureau for other purposes. The two directors have had a major conflict, and Director Xu resigned and went to the province yesterday (4th). The local authorities have repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay and promised to order the county to strictly order the Finance Bureau to properly allocate funds to maintain education. After hearing the news, the teachers publicly elected Zhou Yu, the principal of the Eastern District Elementary School, to lead the charge in sending a telegram to the Education Department, urging Xu to stay and requesting strict pursuit of the arrears. This morning, the principals of the elementary schools in the Central District gathered at the Mashan Temple for an emergency meeting. At 10 a.m., they met with County Magistrate Ma, requesting him to strictly order the Finance Bureau chief to stop diverting education funds and to send personnel to the bureau to settle the diverted education funds for several months. Each teacher will hand over the outstanding payments as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reducing the Price of Salt Permits</p>

The Salt Inspection Office, in order to reorganize tax revenue and reduce the burden on salt consumers, has issued a special order to eliminate all bad practices to prevent embezzlement and ordered the salt offices of the four banks to properly handle the reduction of the permit price for salt merchants. The Anhui bank has already reduced the price by four cents per unit according to the ratio. The price of each stone of salt from north to south Anhui is twelve yuan and four cents. The price of each stone in Lai, Lai, Quan, and three counties is set at nine yuan and four jiao, which has been announced to the various banks for implementation.</p>

Luo saw that they were acquaintances and led them. Luo's wife followed her husband, but after walking a few steps, two more people came from the side and strangled Luo to death with a rope. One of them said to Luo's wife, "You can find your husband tomorrow at Cao Mang Mountain." Luo's wife, because it was dark and out of familial affection, originally wanted to call for help, but fearing that she would be harmed by the large number of people, she did not make a sound. The next day, Luo's wife went to the address and found her husband's body in the mountain's stream. She hired someone to retrieve the body. A small millstone was tied to his chest, a very tragic sight. Luo's wife has buried her husband and reported the situation to the district chief, requesting justice.</p>

<h3>National Aviation Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Organized by Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Drafts Constitution and Sends to Hankou</p>
<p>In order to promote national aviation salvation, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, in addition to promoting the China National Aviation Salvation Association, also initiated the National Aviation Salvation Association, intending to invite influential figures from all parties to engage in organization and seek to expand methods. If the results are good, the aviation associations in various places will be incorporated into the association. Chiang recently telegraphed various circles in Shanghai to expedite the process, with the government playing a supervisory and assisting role. The association's constitution, drafted by Lin Kanghou of the banking community, has been revised and sent to Chiang in Hankou for review. It is understood that the content is similar to the constitution of the China National Aviation Salvation Association.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Commemoration of the Zhaohe Uprising</h3>
<p>Municipal Party Department Holds Meeting</p>
<p>Wu Kaisheng Speaks on the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. yesterday, the Municipal Party Department held a meeting in the auditorium on the third floor to commemorate the 17th anniversary of the Zhaohe warship uprising, while simultaneously holding an expanded memorial week. More than 300 people attended, including Tao Baichuan from the Municipal Party Department, Zheng Letian from the Garrison Command, Wu Xiu from the Municipal Education Association, Hou Dachun representing Yang Hu, and representatives from various agencies, organizations, and party departments at all levels. Tao Baichuan presided over the meeting, with Tong Muge as the recorder and Zhu Chun as the master of ceremonies. After the formalities, the chairman reported on the Zhaohe uprising. Then, Wu Kaisheng gave a speech on the current situation of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, stating that Sino-Japanese diplomacy has reached its most serious stage because the League of Nations has transferred the Sino-Japanese incident to the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations for handling. However, the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations also uses the Lytton Report as a basis for discussion. If the solution is based on the Lytton Report, the three northeastern provinces will inevitably form an international free city, not much different from Danzig in Europe. If so, even if Japan cannot monopolize the eastern provinces, China cannot guarantee the integrity of its territory. In this serious situation, we can only hope that the government will use diplomatic means to achieve a diplomatic victory while actively assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army so that the violent sun dares not swallow this bomb. Finally, representatives from all walks of life shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Telegram Request to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to Decide on Policies Towards Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram from the Volunteer Army Relief Team</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Volunteer Army Relief Team of this city sent a telegram to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which read: "To the Esteemed Members of the Third Plenary Session, since the Mukden Incident occurred, the entire nation has been shocked, and the country is in a precarious state, like a pile of eggs. At this time of national crisis and political instability, our expectations of the government are becoming more urgent. Now, the Third Plenary Session is about to open. The Council of the League of Nations has already transferred the Sino-Japanese issue to the League of Nations Special Committee for discussion. The Special Committee is scheduled to meet on December 6th. After one or two debates, it will still be handed over to the League of Nations General Assembly for resolution. Therefore, the day the League of Nations General Assembly opens will be the time of our Third Plenary Session. It is imperative not only to cope with international diplomacy and obtain concrete policies and prompt guidance but also to obtain fundamental decisions and appropriate instructions on other political, economic, educational, social, and construction matters. We urge the members of the Central Committee to recognize this new trend and seize this good opportunity to plan and implement efficient politics, a controlled economy, and a self-defensive national defense. We feel that today's question of Japan, based on the three major principles indicated by nationalism, has also clearly shown us the correct path and the policies to be adopted. We deeply hope that the members of the General Assembly will not make empty resolutions but will seek the root causes and prescribe the right medicine, ending the difficult situation of the past. Will China, a nation of the 20th century, alone be unable to unite to defend its country and stand against the tyrannical Japanese, internally reversing adversity and externally resisting powerful forces? Respectfully, the Shanghai Office of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team."</p>
<h3>Transoceanic Telephone Call Between China and Italy</h3>
<p>Iron, Times, Zeng Zhongming, Italian Envoy, Ciano, etc.</p>
<p>Met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini the night before last</p>
<p>New equipment on the Italian ship Conte Russo</p>
<p>The Da Bai News Agency reports: The Italian postal ship Conte Russo has the world's latest invention, a long-distance telephone device. It is as if one is in the same room, no matter how far away. When the ship arrived in Shanghai last time, it was tested by the Italian Minister to China, Mr. Ciano, who spoke with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The result was exceptionally satisfactory. The ship travels between Shanghai and Italy and is the most luxurious postal ship in the world. It is also very fast, taking only 23 days for a one-way trip to Europe, which is more than one-third shorter than ordinary postal ships. The ship arrived in Shanghai from Europe the day before yesterday and is berthed at the No. 11 floating buoy in Yangshupu. Mr. Ciano specially telegraphed to Beijing, inviting Tie Times and Zeng Zhongming to Shanghai for testing to prepare for commercial use. Mr. Zeng arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. At 11:30 PM the night before last (the 4th) (4:30 PM Rome time), Mr. and Mrs. Ciano, together with Mr. Zeng, boarded the ship and spoke with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Italian Minister of Transportation Ciano, and the Chinese Chargé d'affaires to Italy. The sound waves were exceptionally clear. The situation at the time is recorded below:</p>
<p>Equipment on the Ship: Of the postal ships with long-distance telephone devices, there are only three in the world, two American and one Italian. The American ships travel between Europe and America, and the only Italian ship traveling between Europe and Asia is the Conte Russo. This time, the wireless radio room is divided into two rooms, located on the highest deck of the ship, one at the bow and one in the midship, each with several people in charge. The radio station in Italy is located within the Italian Ministry of Transportation. Any telephone call from the ship can be received there and then transferred to an ordinary city telephone and connected to the home of the person who wishes to speak. There is no distance that cannot be reached in England, Italy, Germany, and France.</p>
<p>Telephone Conversation: Italian Minister of Transportation Ciano is the father of Italian Minister Ciano, so after the call was made from the ship, it was received at Mr. Ciano's home. However, when Mr. Ciano identified himself as Ciano of Shanghai, his family suspected it was nonsense and hung up. The call was made again, and Mr. Ciano's father personally answered the call. After the introduction, Zeng Zhongming spoke with Mr. Ciano, first thanking him for the call and hoping that the friendship between the two countries would be strengthened. Mr. Ciano said that Prime Minister Mussolini was very willing to talk with him but was unfortunately out on official business, which was deeply regrettable. Then he spoke with Liu, the Chargé d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Italy, for a long time. At about 12:00 (5:00 PM Rome time), the Italian radio station said that the Prime Minister had already returned home. The Italian Minister's wife, who is Mussolini's daughter, answered the call first, chatting about family matters in a very affectionate manner. Then Mr. Zeng answered the call, first expressing his respect to Mr. Mussolini. Mr. Mussolini also wished our China prosperity. The conversation ended at 2:00 AM (7:00 PM Rome time). The reporter from the Da Bai News Agency also listened carefully during the call, and the words were very clear, even more so than the long-distance line between Beijing and Shanghai. Telephone Rates: The ship has already successfully tested this wireless telephone and has decided to open it for public use. When the ship arrives at the port, one can go directly to the ship to make a call, whether to a private residence, government office, or business in Europe or Southeast Asia. The price is 25 yuan (in national currency) per three minutes for Italy, 31 yuan for Australia, 41 yuan for Belgium, 35 yuan for France, 35 yuan for Germany, and 30 yuan for Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Another Fifth Batch of Cash Being Transported to the Northeast</h3>
<p>▲ 5,285,000 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Being Transported to Dalian Today on a British Ship and Transferred to Shenyang</p>
<p>The banks in the Northeast have purchased four batches of silver dollars in Shanghai, totaling approximately 12 million yuan, which have been transported to Liaoning and part of which has been shipped to Yingkou. Now that the end of the year is approaching, the people of the Northeast need even more cash, so a fifth batch has been purchased. Nanrongji has reported 520 boxes, Dongshunji has reported 102 boxes, Yishunheng has reported 154 boxes, Beihengyi has reported 84 boxes, Yongfeng has reported 92 boxes, Dachanglong has reported 54 boxes, Tongjulong has reported 46 boxes, and Tiantaisheng and others have reported 5 boxes, for a total of 1,057 boxes, totaling 5,285,000 yuan in national currency, all Yuan heads. They are scheduled to be loaded onto a British ship today to Dalian, transferred to the South Manchurian Railway, and then transported to Liaoning. Including the previous four batches, a total of 17 million yuan in cash has already been transported to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Telegram to People's Organizations in All Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>▲ Strive to Aid the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>▲ Rescuing Others is Rescuing Oneself and Rescuing the Country</p>
<p>The National Salvation Joint Association of various organizations in this port has recently issued the following telegram due to the brave resistance of the Northeast Volunteer Army and the serious situation, and the fact that the people of the whole country have not yet fully risen up to provide assistance: "To the esteemed people's organizations in all provinces and cities, the loss of the Northeast has exceeded one year in an instant, and the state is in an increasingly dangerous situation. The tyrannical Japanese, with whom we share no common ground, have recently used the most poisonous means to slaughter our Northeast compatriots and destroy our Northeast cultural relics. Fortunately, our loyal and brave Volunteer Army for National Salvation is fighting to the death, unswervingly...</p>
<p>Since the war, they have been fighting hard in bloody battles and have finally severely damaged the stubborn enemy, promoting the spirit of our nation. Compatriots throughout the country have always admired them. However, after accumulating months and years, they have exhausted their weapons and ammunition. The severe cold has arrived, and freezing and starvation are imminent. Moreover, with a strong enemy in front of us, it is a time of great urgency. If we do not expand our assistance and provide long-term support, the Volunteer Army will be destroyed, the Northeast will be lost, China will be lost, and we will be lost. Rescuing others, rescuing ourselves, and rescuing the country has reached the stage of the final effort of our national people. We hope that the people's organizations in all provinces and cities will actively carry out spiritual and material relief for the Northeast Volunteer Army, wipe out national humiliation, and recover lost territories. The responsibility lies in the efforts of our national people. We humbly report our sincere intentions and join with the people of the whole country to achieve this. Respectfully, Zhang Yiying, Shen Zuru, Chen Yafu, Chen Peide, Zhang Tianbai, Wang Hanliang, etc., Standing Directors of the National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Letter to Friends in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Unite with All Those Who Resist Japan</p>
<p>▲ Provide Subsidies to Those Who Can Fight the Enemy</p>
<p>The Hualian News Agency reports from this port on the 5th that a certain gentleman received a letter from Zhu Jiqing from the front line on November 25th, which stated in brief: "The work of resisting Japan cannot be accomplished in a short period, nor can it be accomplished by the current methods. This time out of the customs cannot be said to be without preparation, but in terms of the current methods, although there is preparation, it is actually equivalent to no preparation. Knowing that there is no preparation, and being eager to come out this time, is to create a prelude to preparation. With this action, we can arouse all parties to engage in substantial preparation. With substantial preparation, we can be helpful. I have long held the firm belief that we should unite with all those who resist Japan and provide subsidies to all those who can fight the enemy. Those who are confident in their patriotic enthusiasm, ability to save the country, and determination to resist the enemy to the end, and who have no other intentions, then I am willing to be their humble servant; otherwise, I would rather be Yue Wumu."</p>

<p>Shanghai Muslim Mosque Federation members Hadecheng, Lin Wensheng, Da Pusheng, Jin Congren, and 35 representatives, petitioned the Municipal Government again yesterday morning regarding the Beixin Bookstore's insult to Islam, requesting that the Central Government's order be followed and the bookstore be sealed as soon as possible to appease public anger. Secretary-General Yu received them and promised to write to the court again to investigate. The representatives were satisfied and bid farewell. Secretary-General Yu then relayed the situation to the Mayor, who decided to write to the First Special District Local Court and send Secretary-General Yu to visit Mr. Feisindun, the Director-General of the Public Concession, requesting him to persuade the Beixin Bookstore to postpone reopening to avoid disputes. After Secretary-General Yu went to explain the situation at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Feisindun agreed to comply.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Arrest of Jin Cheol Contains Unfathomable Intentions</h3>
<p>▲ Special Attention was Paid to Sino-Korean Relations During the Interrogation</p>
<p>▲ Jin Leaves Shanghai for Medical Treatment, Entrusting Wu Kaisheng to Handle Negotiations</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that after the Municipal Government protested to the French and Japanese Consulates over the case of the Japanese sending people to break into the French Concession to arrest people without authorization, both sides are now considering it. However, the Japanese's assistance in illegally arresting Jin Yongdohk contains other intentions. Jin has now left Shanghai for medical treatment, and all negotiations have been entrusted to lawyer Wu Kaisheng. The property confiscated by the Japanese when he was arrested the other day has been requested by lawyer Cai Xiaobai from the French Consulate in a letter yesterday to be recovered from the Japanese side. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jin Cheol and Jin Cheol Left Shanghai: After Jin Cheol was released from the French Consulate, he resided at Room 606, 6th floor, Dahuh Hotel, Dongxinqiao, under the alias Liao, and asked a famous doctor from the Red Cross to treat him. The injuries from being tied up on his hands and feet had not yet recovered. His left side of his back was bruised, and his chest was also swollen. According to the doctor's examination, his lungs were injured due to being violently struck while struggling. There was a scratch on the right side of his nose, and three blows to the back of his head. His hands and feet were numb and he could barely hold a pen. His hair was combed halfway, and several strands were pulled out, with traces of blood. At 8:30 AM on the 4th, a certain Chinese gentleman sent him to Nanxiang by car. His son Jin Cheol went with him. Jin Cheol suffered more than fifty injuries on his head, hands, feet, and body due to fighting with Japanese detectives. His mouth was stuffed with a towel by the Japanese detectives several times, causing his skin to break and bleed, making it difficult for him to eat. According to the doctor, his life is not in danger.</p>
<p>The Japanese's Intentions in Arresting Jin: After Jin's friends sent Jin off, they visited the reporter yesterday after being entrusted by Jin to talk about the Japanese side's intention during the interrogation of Jin Yongdohk. It is said that the main points of interest are roughly as follows: 1) Asking about the source of Jin's finances when he served as the Minister of Finance of the Korean Revolutionary Party, from which Chinese agency and from whom did it come, and from which place and whom in Korea was it sent; 2) How was the military organization of the Korean Revolutionary Party, how was the source of military pay and the supply of munitions, and who and which agency in China provided assistance, and in what amount; 3) Who were the Chinese people he associated with in Shanghai, and who were the important people in the Shanghai Korean Revolutionary Party's agency? There were many other matters, but none involved the word "China." Jin replied that there was no such thing, and was therefore beaten.</p>
<p>Recovering Confiscated Property: The French and Japanese Consulates have reportedly received the Municipal Government's protest but have not yet given a formal response. Both sides are still studying it. However, Cai Xiaobai, Jin's representative lawyer, believes that the Japanese's confiscation of Jin's property is unreasonable and sent a letter to the French Consulate in his capacity as a representative yesterday afternoon, requesting that it be recovered from the Japanese side. The content of the letter stated that Jin Yongdohk was kidnapped by the Japanese side, and after being released through the negotiations of your consulate, this lawyer represents Jin Yongdohk in expressing his gratitude. However, Jin had $560 in silver dollars, a gold watch, a fountain pen, a stamp, and a呢大衣with him when he was arrested. In addition to requesting the Municipal Government to negotiate, I am sending this letter to your Consul-General to request that it be recovered from the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Huang Zhanying's History: Jin's arrest was entirely due to the machinations of the traitor Huang Zhanying. Huang is from Taishan County, Guangdong, and is about thirty years old. He followed Central Committee member Li Liejun for many years and worked in lawyer Wu Chengyu's office for a long time, and had many connections with revolutionary party members from Guangdong. This time, he met Jin Cheol through the introduction of a certain gentleman from Guangdong, but unexpectedly, he committed this act of betraying his country and his friends. After Jin Cheol was kidnapped, the police searched Huang's residence and removed all his name cards, documents, and suitcases, leaving only wooden furniture and bedding, which shows how deeply premeditated it was. Huang rented a building across from the Shanghai Bank on Avenue Joffre this summer and lived there for several months before moving to No. 2 Ruyili, Avenue du Roi Albert, to set up his office.</p>
<p>Hiring Lawyer Wu Kaisheng: After Jin Cheol was arrested, lawyer Cai Xiaobai of the Wu Kaisheng Law Firm was introduced by a certain gentleman to handle the case. Because the case involved the legal rights of China and France, Wu Kaisheng was also introduced by a certain gentleman to handle the case. According to lawyer Wu's remarks, the illegal arrest of Korean resident Jin Yongdohk by Japanese police in China was handled by lawyer Cai Xiaobai of this law firm. Thanks to the Municipal Government and the French Consul-General's legal struggle, a satisfactory result was obtained, and the people of the country are grateful and gratified. This is the second illegal action by the Japanese since the arrest of political prisoner Ahn Chang-ho, and it has a great impact on the safety of residents of the French Concession. I sincerely hope that the French Concession will seriously negotiate with the Japanese side to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. However, from a legal point of view, it is still necessary to explain that Jin Yongdohk obtained Chinese nationality in October of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China and resided in the French Concession within the territory of China. Even if there is a suspicion of a crime, according to the current treaty, the Japanese Consul may request the French Consul to send him to the Special District Court for handling. Even if it is recognized that Jin Yongdohk still has Japanese nationality, he can only request extradition from the French Consul. If it is found that he has obtained Chinese nationality or is a political prisoner, the French Consul may refuse extradition. The Japanese police have absolutely no reason to arrest him themselves. Japan claims to be a civilized country, but its actions often overstep the line, which is very regrettable.</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Agrees with Zhang Qun's Open Telegram</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Lingji's Visit to Chiang Did Not Involve Sichuan Matters</p>
<p>A report from Wuhan a few days ago stated that Fu Wang Fangzhou (Lingji) was ordered by Liu Xiang to visit Chairman Chiang in Wuhan to oppose the proposal to establish a Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee and the entry of a certain official into Sichuan. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed a certain representative of the Sichuan Rehabilitation Supervision Office yesterday and asked if this was true. According to the response, Wang Lingji's visit to Chairman Chiang was purely to report on the bandit suppression defense affairs in western Hubei and did not involve Sichuan matters. As for Chairman Zhang Yuejun's open telegram, Governor Liu (Xiang) agrees with it. The above-mentioned report from Wuhan is not true.</p>
<h3>Responses to the Call for Air Mobilization</h3>
<p>▲ Starting Next Week, It Will Be Student Aviation Sports Week</p>
<p>▲ Ling Xianyang, the Commissioner to the United States, is Scheduled to Set Sail on the 8th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scouts recently promoted the general mobilization for aviation, and all sectors of society responded enthusiastically, requesting to participate in the work of the Aviation Construction Association. However, because that day was designated as the Boy Scouts' general mobilization day, the request was not approved. The Association held a standing council meeting at the Continental Arcade yesterday, chaired by Yin Zhiling. The reports included: 1) The results of the Boy Scouts' general mobilization. The membership fees obtained will be entirely deposited in the bank by the Association to purchase airplanes for the Boy Scouts to address the national crisis. In response to the requests of all sectors of society to participate in the work, it was decided to designate the period starting next week as Aviation Sports Week for students of all schools; 2) Commissioner Ling Xianyang, who was sent by the Association to the Americas to arrange everything for Weng Zhaoyuan, the Association's overseas plenipotentiary representative, will set sail on the 8th. He will report to the meeting on his itinerary to the United States and the detailed work plan in the United States. It was decided to subsidize Mr. Ling with 200 yuan per month for household expenses in addition to the original travel expenses; 3) The discussion of the regulations for the organization of branch offices was resolved, and Yin Zhiling, Tan Bozhi, and Jiang Junyi were appointed to review them.</p>
<h3>Commercial Shares Received by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>▲ 1,004 Shares Received on the 3rd</p>
<p>▲ The Initial Purpose Will Not Be Changed Due to the Change in the Legal Rights Association</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Ministry ordered that the commercial shares of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company be nationalized at 50 taels per share, and since the 1st of this month, the Central Bank has been handling it and reporting the number of shares received each day to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The number of shares received each day is of concern to those who care about current affairs. The reporter inquired at the current affairs meeting of the company yesterday and was received by General Manager Liu Hongsheng, who was asked about the commercial shares and the reorganization plan. According to him, the company's reform is currently under way, with each department drafting the facts that should be promoted and reformed, and then gathering various opinions to draft a reform plan. It will take three months for everything to be decided and implemented, so it is still in the planning stage at this time. As for the loan agreement signed with the China Business Corporation in the past, although I have discussed it with the other party, it is still under study. Whether the contract exists or is abolished must be inquired of the Business Corporation, and I have no way to express my opinion. Regarding the nationalization of commercial shares, 14 shares were received on the 1st of this month, 224 shares were received on the 2nd, and 666 shares were received on the 3rd, for a total of 1,004 shares. It is said that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company issued more than 40,000 shares in the past, and today it is only one-fortieth. Based on the current situation, it may be more active every day in the future. Since I took office, I have not brought money to advance, and the Board of Directors has not advanced money. The Debt Committee will be established, and the total amount owed is about 17 million, but the detailed situation must be inquired of the responsible personnel of the Committee.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Communications, visited Song Daiyuan, President of the National Academy of Peking, at Qiqi Road yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM and did not leave until 5:00 PM. According to Minister Zhu, the government has not yet decided on its attitude towards the shareholders' Legal Rights Maintenance Association organized by some shareholders of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but the government will not change its initial intention to nationalize the company, and the establishment of the association is not expected to have a significant impact.</p>
<p>A telegram from Beijing stated that Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, said that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed 5 million from HSBC in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, and with interest compounded, it has reached more than 7.007 million. It is difficult to thoroughly reorganize it without repaying the old debt. Now that the national treasury is tight, it is unable to raise this huge amount of money, so after the Debt Consolidation Committee is established, it will plan to borrow new funds from the banking sector to repay the old debts through legal procedures in order to gradually reform.</p>

<h3>Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Requests Refund of Rayon Import Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, considering the severe impact on the export sales of silk fabrics, previously sent a letter to the International Trade Association, forwarding it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a refund of the rayon import tax, as reported in previous newspapers. Two months have passed since then, but it has not been implemented. In order to promote the development of international trade, the association is eager to find a solution. Now, they have prepared a summary and plan to send representatives to visit Minister of Finance Song to personally explain the situation and request the prompt refund of the rayon import tax to reduce costs and provide relief. The original text of the summary is copied below:</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Due to the Ministry of Finance's additional rayon tax imposed on August 4th, the export trade of rayon fabrics and rayon-mixed fabrics woven by domestic silk factories to foreign countries such as Southeast Asia and India has been greatly affected. It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance refund the collected rayon tax at the original rates for all rayon fabrics woven by domestic factories and exported to foreign trade, in order to alleviate the distress of the domestic silk weaving industry and promote the development of foreign trade. The impact, process, measures, and benefits of this matter are listed below to prove that it will not affect national tax revenue, but merchants will benefit immensely.</p>
<p>(1) Impact:</p>
<p>The increase in the rayon tax was originally intended to alleviate the decline in the price of domestic natural silk. However, after implementation, not only has the domestic silk market not seen any effective results, but the domestic silk weaving industry has been severely impacted in markets such as Southeast Asia and India. The rayon tax was first imposed in 1931. At that time, the sales of Chinese silk in Southeast Asia and India suffered a significant decline. A table is provided below for comparison:</p>
<p>Comparison of Chinese Silk Sales in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>| Year   | 1929        | 1931        |</p>
<p>| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |</p>
<p>| Location | Sales Value | Sales Value |</p>
<p>| India  | 8 million taels | 5 million taels |</p>
<p>| Annam  | 5 million taels | 2 million taels |</p>
<p>| Singapore | 5 million taels | 2 million taels |</p>
<p>According to the silver amounts listed in the table, rayon-mixed fabrics and rayon fabrics account for 60-70%. After China increased the rayon tax, the sales of Chinese silk were actually 50% lower than before the increase. The significant impact is self-evident. On August 4th of this year, the rayon import tax was increased again, by 15 customs gold units per picul, resulting in a 5% to 15% increase in the cost of rayon fabrics. Therefore, the selling price also increased. Japanese rayon fabrics, due to their low cost, have always been cheaper than Chinese silk in Southeast Asia and India. Now, they are making every effort to dump their products there. If Chinese silk also reduces its price, it will inevitably suffer significant losses. If the price is not reduced, it will be stockpiled and ignored. Business has plummeted, and foreign trade silk merchants are hesitant to move forward.</p>
<p>(2) Process:</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association sent a letter to the China International Trade Association on August 5th, stating the reasons, requesting the Ministry of Finance (Industry) to refund the originally collected rayon import tax for all rayon fabrics and rayon-mixed fabrics woven by domestic factories and exported to foreign countries, in order to reduce costs and maintain the inherent position of the silk market in India and Southeast Asia. Subsequently, the association received a reply stating that the Ministry of Industry had requested the Ministry of Finance to investigate. Two months have passed, but the Ministry of Finance has not yet approved it. As the sales of silk by domestic silk manufacturers to Southeast Asia and India are declining day by day, we request prompt approval again.</p>
<p>(3) Measures:</p>
<p>If the refund of the rayon import tax is approved, if cash is refunded, not only will the customs be cumbersome, but the procedures will also be complicated. Therefore, it is suggested that the customs specially print a type of customs gold unit voucher for the refund of the rayon import tax, fill in the amount at any time, and refund it. Any domestic factory exporting rayon fabrics for foreign trade should first register the product name and composition with the customs for record purposes, so that there is a basis for investigation and no malpractices will occur. When rayon fabrics are exported for foreign trade, the "Customs Gold Unit Voucher for Rayon Import Tax" should be issued at the time of customs declaration, allowing it to be used to fully offset the rayon import tax in the future. This is a simple and easy measure that will benefit merchants immensely.</p>
<p>(4) Benefits:</p>
<p>After the rayon import tax is refunded, on the surface, the government's tax revenue may seem slightly insufficient. However, in reality, it will not only not be reduced, but it will also increase tax revenue. Currently, after the increase in the rayon import tax, the export of rayon fabrics from domestic factories has gradually decreased, resulting in a shortfall in export tax revenue. If the refund of the rayon import tax is approved, the export sales of woven fabrics will inevitably be prosperous. Furthermore, the raw materials for these silks are half rayon and half domestic natural silk. With the vigorous export of silk, domestic silk will also have a way out. This is something that the government should encourage. Last year, the Ministry of Industry issued a plan to encourage industry, which included a special clause stating that "the raw material tax for all exported goods can be refunded upon export." Now, merchants are requesting a refund of the rayon import tax, which is not an excessive demand and seems reasonable. Moreover, it will have absolutely no impact on the government's tax revenue. As the crisis is imminent and the silk industry is on the verge of bankruptcy, we dare to request the Minister to promptly approve it in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain the industry. This is a truly virtuous and convenient measure.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association (Seal)</p>

The industry is now in decline, but the fundraising can still reach this large amount. This is due to the enthusiastic patriotism of the members of the association and their active contributions, as well as the hard work and efforts of the committee members.</p>
<h3>Record of Inspection of the Completed Dike Project by the National Government Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Welcome in Jiujiang</p>
<p>The Jiangxin wheel arrived in Jiujiang at 9 pm on December 1st. Representatives from the county party headquarters, the chamber of commerce, and all walks of life arrived at the pier to welcome them. Then, Jiujiang County Magistrate Jiang Ji, accompanied by all members of the delegation, walked to the nearby Zhenxing Western Restaurant. They hosted a tea party in the name of the Jiujiang County Government. During the banquet, County Magistrate Jiang first delivered a welcome speech, stating briefly that he recalled the floods of the previous year. The people of Jiangxi Province survived in a life-and-death situation, thanks to the relief from your association. The great dike project has been built, benefiting the rural areas. On behalf of all sectors of the county, I would like to thank you. The reception is simple, and I hope you will forgive us. Li Zushi, on behalf of the inspection team, replied, stating briefly that today we appreciate that County Magistrate Jiang came to welcome us from afar, which shows his concern for the people's suffering. The Flood Relief Association will expedite the completion of the unfinished projects in Jiangxi, and we are very willing to continue to serve Jiangxi Province with our remaining efforts. On behalf of the entire inspection team, I would like to thank Mr. Jiang and representatives from all walks of life for their kind intentions. Next, representatives from the county party headquarters and the chamber of commerce gave speeches, expressing their deep welcome. Finally, Sun Faxu, a member of the inspection team, gave a speech entitled "The Model Village of China." Mr. Sun once served as the model county magistrate of Ding County, Hebei Province, and has served as the governor of Shandong and Shanxi provinces. His political achievements were well-known at the time. He was a subordinate of Li Huangpo. When Mr. Sun spoke, he used a humorous tone and contained deep meaning. He criticized those who blindly believed in Europeanization. His speech is worth recording, so it is recorded as follows: Mr. Sun said that he was able to participate in the inspection team. After resigning as the governor of Shanxi Province, he engaged in farmland planting. The land he cultivated was in Tongcheng, Anhui, where the inspection team visited. He was studying rural economic cooperation when he was suddenly hit by the worst flood in a century, which inundated all the farmland. In fact, he is a pure disaster victim. Thanks to the government's advocacy, social promotion, and donations from friendly countries, the embankment that was completely destroyed over thousands of miles up and down the Yangtze River can be restored to its original state with the least economic cost and the shortest time. This is not only difficult in China's complicated political situation, but it would not be easy to recover so quickly even if a civilized country in Europe and America encountered the above situation. For us disaster victims, our gratitude must be greater than that of ordinary people, without the need for further explanation. As a pure disaster victim, he can participate in the inspection team and spend time with philanthropists, engineering experts, and journalists from China and abroad, and follow them to inspect the dike project. Seeing the consolidation of the project, he cannot help but admire it. Tonight, he wanted to give a speech entitled "Zhaicheng Model Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, China." He believes that there are three essential elements of politics: (1) the people must be organized; (2) the people must have the ability to govern themselves, without relying on external forces to seek progress; (3) the people must have economic knowledge, and all actions must be in line with economic principles in order to advance smoothly and prevent distorted development. Zhaicheng Model Village is located in the east of the county, 30 miles from the city, with about 2,000 people. Its customs are good, and the beginning of the organization focused on the aforementioned three elements. Therefore, the village has an elders association, a women's association, and a youth association. Those who are farmers and workers have the organization of agricultural and industrial associations. Roads, bridges, cleanliness, and hygiene are all based on their ability to govern themselves, without relying on external forces, so that people can see at a glance that it is a model of self-government. Secondly, all the people in the village are diligent and thrifty, and can gradually progress according to the economic strength of the whole village. Gentlemen, people often criticize that the Chinese people have no organization, no self-governing ability, and no economic knowledge. The Zhaicheng Village in Ding County, which I mentioned, can be visited by those who have visited it, and can know that this village can slightly cleanse the shame of the Chinese people. The biggest feature of this village is two: (1) The villagers are harmonious and eliminate litigation; (2) Every year, taxes are paid during a certain period, and the village chief goes to the county to pay them. If you travel to Ding County, try to consult the receipt book of the judicial organs. Zhaicheng has no civil or criminal litigation. Try to read the collection books. Zhaicheng has never been punished for arrears. This is enough to comfort Chinese and foreigners. Mr. Sun finally concluded his speech by saying that today all sectors of Jiujiang gathered here to welcome us, or it is like the story of Anqing, waiting for a long time at the pier, or even not having a full meal. I am very sorry for my lengthy speech. I should pause here. Until half past twelve, the guests and hosts parted happily and returned to Jiangxin wheel. (Qian Hua left Jiujiang at 12 pm on December 1st)</p>

<h3>First Special Court's New President Guo Yunguan Sworn In</h3>
<p>Guo Speaks of Shanghai's Every Variety of Prosperity</p>
<p>It Must Be Done So That Corruption is Eliminated and the Atmosphere is Pure</p>
<p>| Large Discussion on How Judges Must Not Love Money |</p>
<p>Guo Yunguan, the newly appointed acting president of the Shanghai First Special District Court, held a swearing-in ceremony at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Sixth Tribunal on the third floor of the new building of the court. Military, police, and political figures from various organizations in the city came to the court to witness the ceremony, and the turnout was exceptionally enthusiastic, filling the hall. The scene was quite grand. President Guo personally greeted the guests with amiability and attentiveness. The details of the event are as follows:</p>
<p>The Arrangement of the Auditorium: The auditorium was located in the Sixth Tribunal on the third floor of the new building on the east side of the court. A portrait of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's will were hung in the center, and the oath, party song, and agenda of the inauguration were posted on the left and right sides. The Party and national flags were crossed above them. The walls were covered with signs indicating the seats for the supervisor, oath-taker, party representatives, guests, and journalists. At the main entrance of the special court, a white cloth with the black characters "The World is for All" and the couplet "The Revolution is Not Yet Complete," "Comrades Still Need to Strive" were hung, along with two crossed Party and national flags. The guest registration area was set up there.</p>
<p>The Ceremony of the Inauguration: ㈠ The supervisor takes the chair; ㈡ The oath-taker takes their place; ㈢ The entire audience stands at attention; ㈣ The Party song is sung; ㈤ The highest respect is paid to the national flag, the Party flag, and the portrait of the Prime Minister; ㈥ The chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will; ㈦ Three minutes of silence; ㈧ The oath is taken; ㈨ The supervisor gives an instruction; ㈩ The Party representative delivers a speech; ㈩㈠ The guests deliver speeches; ㈩㈡ The oath-taker gives a reply; ㈩㈢ The ceremony concludes with a photograph.</p>
<p>Guest List: Wang Zhengting, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Central Committee Member; Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai; Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau; Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Works Bureau; Wang Yiga, Representative of the Garrison Headquarters; Ying Shi, President of the Second Special District Court; Wang Xun, Representative of the Shanghai District Court; Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Xu Jiqing from the banking sector; He Dehui, Assistant of the Public Concession; Wang Yaotang, lawyer for the Public Concession; Shen Junru and Li Zuyu, representatives of the Lawyers' Association; lawyer Lin Yingqing; and all judges, prosecutors, and reporters from various newspapers and news agencies of the First Special Court, totaling more than 300 people, gathered in one place.</p>
<p>The President's Oath: I, Guo Yunguan, solemnly swear that I will恪遵循 the Prime Minister's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by the laws, and be loyal and diligent in my duties. I pledge never to waste a single penny, never to misuse a single person, and never to engage in self-interest, fraud, or the acceptance of bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This I swear.</p>
<p>The Supervisor's Instructions: Yu Hua, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, delivered instructions on behalf of Shen Jia, President of the court, stating, in brief: Today, President Guo is being sworn in, and I am very honored to participate in this grand ceremony on behalf of President Shen of the Second Branch of the High Court. The oath that the oath-taker has just read covers the main points of loyalty, diligence, not wasting a single penny, and not misusing a single person. It is hoped that the oath-taker will put these points into practice. As for the statement of never accepting bribes, it is especially important for judicial officials. Fortunately, President Guo has a deep understanding of this. I recall that when the Lawyers' Association hosted President Guo a few days ago, someone at the banquet asked President Guo to express his political views. President Guo said, "Governance does not require much talk." This shows that President Guo seeks practicality in all matters, and therefore, he will surely strive to uphold all points in the oath.</p>
<p>▲ Guest Speeches: First, Mr. Wang Zhengting took the stage to speak, stating, in brief: Today, President Guo is being sworn in, and I am very honored and pleased to have this opportunity to participate. Outsiders often feel that our country lacks specialized talent, but in fact, it is not that we lack talent, but that it is often not used in the right way. President Guo has studied both Chinese and Western systems and has a particular interest in law. He worked in the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations. After returning to China, he continued to diligently study law and can truly be regarded as a legal expert. Now, the judicial authorities have appointed President Guo to preside, which is truly using his expertise. From now on, President Guo will surely make contributions to the country and society. Law is originally a kind of writing, and its effectiveness depends entirely on the proper application of the judge. The people value law greatly and respect the court because they believe that law can protect life and property. It is impossible to express in words the joy of having a president who is so knowledgeable and deeply studied in law. Although our country has now achieved tariff autonomy, the consular jurisdiction has not yet been abolished. Although this is the responsibility of the diplomatic authorities, all countries are paying attention to whether our country's judges can be dedicated and law-abiding. President Guo is already dedicated and will surely be an aid to diplomacy in the future, allowing all countries to understand that our country not only reforms the law but also has good judges. Then, Wang Yiga, representative of the Garrison Headquarters, and Shen Junru, representative of the Lawyers' Association, delivered speeches in succession. The speeches were lengthy, so details are omitted.</p>
<p>▲ President Guo's Reply: Today, Yunguan is being sworn in, and I am deeply grateful for your presence and guidance. This court was created based on an agreement, and Minister Wang was the one who signed the agreement. Minister Wang said just now that complete recovery cannot be achieved with empty words. This is because although our country's laws are gradually improving, it is also necessary to have people who govern the laws. Yunguan has always advocated not indulging in empty talk but seeking practical implementation. Therefore, there is nothing that can be expressed at present. As for the meaning of the oath, to summarize, it means not to love money. The country knows that the power of money is great, so it repeatedly reminds officials when they take office. There is a saying that military officials are not afraid of death, and civil officials do not love money. Especially judges must not love money. Shanghai is full of prosperity, so people must have a firm heart so as not to be swayed by customs. An ancient sage said, "If you are determined to eat vegetable roots, there is nothing difficult in the world." Saying you don't want money, but then being unwilling to let go when money comes to the door, depends on one's usual cultivation. Yunguan has never liked socializing. When I arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, because I had to host a banquet, I specially chose the "Vegetable Root Fragrance" restaurant on Sanma Road. During the banquet, I made a very solemn statement. Although today is Yunguan's swearing-in, this oath applies to all colleagues. I only hope that we will work together to eliminate corruption and create a pure atmosphere. I hope that all sectors will not hesitate to give advice and give us spiritual assistance.</p>
<h3>Small Business is Not Easy</h3>
<p>Westerners in the Health Department Deliberately Make Things Difficult</p>
<p>Newly Opened Snack Shop Cannot Cope</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Secretary of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: Dear Sir, According to a letter from Feng Xiren, I have opened a snack shop at 43389 Roberts Road in Xinxishi. Before opening, on September 10th, I applied to the Public Concession to obtain a food shop license. Staff from the Fire Brigade, Works Bureau, and Health Department came to inspect. According to the staff at the license application office, the Fire Brigade and Works Bureau have already signed their approval, but the staff from the Health Department have not yet signed, so the license cannot be issued. I rely on this business to make a living and cannot afford to wait any longer. According to general practice, I started business in early October. I have followed all the orders of the Health Department inspector, a Westerner named Feng Shan (transliteration). According to the order of the Fire Brigade inspector, I installed the back door in the location he indicated, but Feng Shan wanted me to move it to another location, so I complied and reinstalled it. I also complied with his order to build several cement walls in the shop, building them and then being ordered to demolish them, demolishing them and then being ordered to build them again. This has already cost about 200 yuan. There was originally a water faucet and a large cement basin on the right side of the building, but I also demolished them according to Feng Shan's order. I complied with his order to reinstall a water faucet and a white porcelain basin in the shop. Now he is ordering me to reinstall the cement basin and water pipe in the original location of the water faucet and cement basin, and it must be installed in the wall. If it is not installed in the wall, it is not hygienic. He said he would come to inspect next week. Yesterday (November 29th), the First Special District Court suddenly sent a summons, stating that I had opened a food shop without obtaining a license from the Public Concession, which is a violation of regulations, and that I must appear in court at 2:00 PM on December 2nd for questioning. Therefore, I am writing to request your association's assistance so that I can make a living and avoid starvation for my family. I would be extremely grateful. After investigating, if the case is as stated in the letter, Feng Shan's behavior is close to deliberately making things difficult for people or hoping to obtain a commission for issuing a license. This kind of tripartite division of power is truly confusing. Last year, due to a certain incident, your bureau intended to find ways to improve, unify authority, and facilitate commerce. To this day, there are still such confusing situations, and there is a need for rapid improvement. In view of the aforementioned situation, we are writing to request your bureau to promptly investigate and issue the license and unify the methods to facilitate commerce.</p>
<h3>Jealousy Leads to Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Russian Man Hates Wife's Affair</p>
<p>Breaks into Room at Midnight, Uses Gun and Knife</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that yesterday morning (the 4th), Li Weizi Ji, a Russian member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, shot and wounded Nidu Wenkefu, his wife's lover, at 51, Lane 103, Xuehuali Road, and stabbed his wife with a bayonet. Li is currently being detained at the French Concession Police Headquarters and will be transferred to the Second Special District Court for trial on Thursday. Li's wife is only 22 years old. She was wounded mostly in both arms, but her injuries are minor. After being bandaged at the hospital, she went home. Her lover, Nidu Wenkefu, was seriously injured and is currently in the Guangci Hospital. It was reported this afternoon (the 5th) that he is in critical condition. Therefore, the French police will observe Nidu's injuries for several days before prosecuting Li Weizi Ji. It is reported that Li married in Harbin in April two years ago. His wife came to Shanghai last September and soon joined the Fourth Company of the Russian Regiment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. His wife worked as a hostess. They lived together until two months ago, when Li's wife suddenly abandoned her husband and fell in love with a young Russian man named Nidu Wenkefu. Therefore, Li Weizi Ji wanted to get rid of Nidu. At 11:00 PM last Saturday night, after returning to the Tangshan Road barracks, he sneaked out at about 2:00 AM, carrying a gun, a bayonet, and several bullets, and went straight to Xuehuali Road. He entered the room where his wife and lover were living, shot and wounded Nidu. His wife came out to fight him, and he stabbed her several times with a bayonet. People who lived together heard the noise and came to see what was happening. They took Li's gun away. Then the police arrived and took him to the police station.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse in Empty Coffin</h3>
<p>▲ Baton Wounds Verified on Waist</p>
<p>▲ Obviously Body Dumped After Death</p>
<p>A male corpse was found in an empty coffin at the head of Qitu Lane, Yangsi Bridge, Pudong. It was glimpsed by the landlord Xia Haigen, and the corpse was identified by the relatives as the elderly Hu Rongjing. This has been reported previously. It is now known that the deceased was 68 years old this year and had a son who was prodigal and wandered outside all year round, and his whereabouts are unknown. The deceased also had no occupation, no production, and often depended on his nephew Zhang Guixiang (adopted by the Zhang family) for living expenses, and also borrowed money from his sister-in-law Hu Liu and others to make a living. He was a useless person. After the case was reported by the local security officer and verified, yesterday the local court appointed Prosecutor Zhang and Verification Officer Xuan to cross the river to Pudong. They verified that the deceased died due to injury, and there were baton wounds on his waist, which was obviously a planned murder and then dumped into the coffin. When questioned, Hu Liu stated that she lived at 36 Xiangqiao Lane, Dadongmen, and the deceased was her husband's brother. Before the 24th of last month, the deceased came to borrow money, but it was inconvenient, so she sent the money to Pudong on the 24th. Unexpectedly, the neighbors said that the deceased had been out for half a month and his whereabouts were unknown. After inquiring everywhere, her nephew Zhang Guixiang found the corpse in the empty coffin on the second day. Zhang Guixiang testified that he lived in Qitu. After his uncle was missing, his mother Hu Liu came and they went to various relatives to inquire, but there was no result. Later, he heard people say that a corpse was found in an empty coffin in Qitu on the 28th. At first, he saw a pair of rush shoes feet at the mouth of the empty coffin, so he recognized his uncle. The official ordered them to collect the body and perform the funeral, and because the case was bizarre, Hu Liu and Zhang Guixiang were handed over to the police station for bail, pending investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Yun Huifang Appeal Case to Be Retried</h3>
<p>▲ All Witnesses Summoned to Court on Time Yesterday</p>
<p>The Yun Huifang appeal case, after being tried once by the Jiangsu Higher Branch Court on the 21st of the previous month, ordered a retrial after the witnesses were incomplete. It has been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the High Court has scheduled a retrial for 1:00 PM on the 14th of this month and has issued summonses to Xia Guoxin, Wang Jisheng, Wang Bujing, and the victim Yu Ti. Yun's defense lawyers are still Zhao Chen, Li Zuyu, and Shen Junru.</p>
<h3>Pu Zhaozhao River Urgently Measuring Earthwork to Start Construction</h3>
<p>▲ Agriculture and Shipping Both Benefit</p>
<p>▲ Budgeted Costs 130,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Pu Zhaozhao River in West Shanghai has been in disrepair for many years. The riverbed is silted up, and the agricultural irrigation along the river has been greatly affected. In recent years, local people have been running around calling for dredging, but it has been difficult to raise funds, and the project has been delayed until now. The river enters the Huangpu River from the Rihui Port in the east, flows through Shangsong and Qingjing, and connects to the Liuhe Rihui Port in the west. The section to Xujiahui is called Zhaojia浜, and the section west of Xujiahui is called Puhuitang. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of the importance of the river, allocated funds for repairs, and the local people were overjoyed. It is now known that the Municipal Works Bureau has completed the planning. The Zhaojia浜 section, with its many factories on the south bank, will use dredging machines to deepen it, so as to dredge sewage. The Puhuitang west of Xujiahui will be dredged manually, and a sluice gate will be set up at the Pailou Bay to prevent sewage from Zhaojia浜 from entering. That is, at that place, according to the old Puhuitang river line, it will be opened to Caojing District from Xiaozha, connecting Caohejing Port, and exiting Baibuqiao Port to the east, so that clean water from the Huangpu River can flow into the interior. This plan is said to be perfect for agricultural irrigation and drinking water for residents. Deepening the Zhaojia浜 section will also facilitate the transportation of ships in the future, and factories will benefit even more. Due to the sudden urgency of time, it was decided to build a dam and start construction this winter, in order to complete it before the spring farming season next year. The Caojing District Municipal Committee Office has sent personnel to measure the earthwork for days. Except for the Zhaojia浜 Xiaozha section, the section to Caohejing is equivalent to opening a river in the field. The total amount of earthwork from Caohejing Port via Longhua to Baibu is estimated at more than 120,000 cubic meters. The budget for building a dam and water leakage, together with the river opening fee, requires about 130,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Issues Order to All Railway Bureaus to Investigate Travel Conditions Everywhere</h3>
<p>▲ Translated and Printed in English, German, and French</p>
<p>▲ Distributed to Europeans and Americans to Facilitate Guidance</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Railways, because European travelers to China are not very clear about the railway routes and conditions in our country, telegraphed the Beijing-Shanghai, Hangzhou-Ningbo, Pinghan, and Jinpu railway bureaus and committees, ordering them to investigate and report in detail the general situation of each railway, railway stations, historical sites and scenic spots, important travel information, and timetables.

<h3>Two Yangtze River Vessels Run Aground</h3>
<p>▲ Baota Island Fuyang Runs Aground. The Shangjiang ship Fuyang of the Sanbei Company was chartered by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to travel between Nanjing and Yichang. This time, sailing upstream from Beijing, on the 3rd of this month, it sailed to the Yangtze River surface of Baota Island downstream of Shashi. It encountered a retreat of upstream water, and the ship mistakenly entered a shoal and ran aground. The ship has lost its ability to move and urgently sent a telegram for help. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received a report and telegraphed the Hankou branch, ordering it to send a ship to tow it. The armed comrades in the ship will be transferred to Yichang by barge.</p>
<p>▲ Tunan is Stranded in Dongliu. The Zhaoshangju Tunan ship was also requisitioned by the military and traveled between Beijing and Hankou. On the night of the 4th of this month, when the ship sailed to the Dongliu River surface opposite Anqing, due to a mistake by the pilot, the ship ran aground in a sandbar. Repeated attempts to reverse the engine failed to dislodge it. Yesterday, it sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai for help. The Shanghai Bureau received a report and telegraphed the Yangtze River ships going upstream and downstream of the bureau to quickly go to tow it.</p>

<p>At 3:50 PM on the 3rd of this month, a burst of firecrackers was suddenly heard near Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, followed by the sight of various colored leaflets flying in the air.

The 2nd of the month was the ninth anniversary of their party, so they made a major publicity campaign the next day, which led to their arrest. The leaflets and banners were presented to the court.

<p>He Chunyuan, a pig vendor from Jiangbei, recently invested in collecting more than 200 pigs with others in Jiangbei and hired Cheng Baorong's boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale.

<h3>Reader Advisory</h3>
<p>㈠ Discussion of the question raised by Ms. Zhang Yunqiu</p>
<p>--See this column on December 3</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Nantang's message: Couples quarrel mostly because the cost of living increases and the income is not enough to cover household expenses. The only way to remedy this is to save money.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Shaba's message: There are several reasons why a couple's love declines: 1. Environmental factors; 2. Extramarital affairs; 3. Minor disagreements; 4. The psychology of preferring the new to the old, with the first point being the most significant. The remedy for the first cause is to "accept fate and abide by one's position," while the remedy for the other three causes is to use the eight characters "respect each other, love each other, and remain the same from beginning to end."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Zengping's message: The first reason is that their thinking is not sound, and they do not understand the true meaning of love. They only know how to enjoy the sweetness of love but have not thought about the obligations they should fulfill. Therefore, once they are together, they feel the burden of responsibility is too heavy. For the second, (A) one should be cautious from the beginning, and both parties must understand each other deeply; (B) recall the trivial matters of past love and use them as conversation material to arouse the revival of old feelings, and never use emotions to argue, resulting in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Xing's message: The first reason is that at the beginning of love, both parties hide their true nature and compromise to achieve their ultimate goal. After living together for a long time, each reveals their true face, and since everything is settled, there is no need to compromise. Thus, love cools, and the tragedy begins. The second remedy: (1) Be able to understand each other, so that "big things become small, and small things become nothing," the best policy; (2) Men and women each find a suitable job and put their spirits into their work to reduce conflict between families, a medium policy; (3) Often make short separations, the worst policy.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Xinmin's message: The first reason is the psychology that "marriage is the tomb of love," and the inability of women to be economically independent is also a major reason. The second remedy: (1) Women must strive for economic independence; (2) In terms of family, men and women must share the burden together. Ms. Huang Liyuan's message: The first reason is that there was no long-term consideration at the beginning, and no attention was paid to the other party's academic qualifications and temperament. The second couple must respect and love each other in peacetime, and both treat each other with sincerity. The wife is good at managing household affairs, and the husband does not waste money outside. If there are differences of opinion, they should forgive each other.</p>
<p>㈡ Mr. Yang Xun's message: 21, 12, 4</p>
<p>I have a question that I have thought about for a long time but cannot resolve, and I ask you to provide an answer that is consistent with the facts. The question is:</p>
<p>"Suppose there are only two ways to do something: one is against conscience but beneficial; one is not against conscience but harmful; then which method should be implemented?"</p>
<p>I am afraid that you will not understand the meaning of this question, so I have cited a practical example below:</p>
<p>"Wang Lao Wu is the owner of a store that specializes in selling × goods. Since the September 18th Incident, he has felt that he would be ashamed to sell × goods again, but if he does not sell them, then the many stocks in the store will inevitably not be sold, and cash will certainly not be obtained. However, the end of the year is approaching, and the payment for ×× foreign firm's goods cannot be delayed! The shareholder's dividends must be paid as required, and there are also daily expenses……… So, what is the best thing to do, continue to sell? Or declare bankruptcy without selling?"</p>
<p>This question ends here, please also follow my method and give me a factual answer in the newspaper! Reply: The question raised in the letter is too general to answer. Now, I will only answer the factual matter cited below: Wang Lao Da sells × goods, which is indeed beneficial to himself, but only benefits the "individual," at most only benefiting the "family." However, on the other hand, it harms our entire country and the entire nation, because Wang Lao Wu's sale of × goods directly causes our country's economy to be hit, and indirectly allows the ×× people to turn the money earned from our country into guns and cannons to fight the volunteers in the Northeast. Is the interest of one person or family important? Or is the interest of one nation important? I think probably anyone can answer this question, not to mention that the fact here is that the benefit is in one family, but the harm is in one country?</p>
<p>The payment for the × well foreign firm's goods must be paid off. Shouldn't the blood debts of the Northeast be repaid? Wang Lao Wu's family's life needs to be paid for, and shouldn't the Northeast volunteers and the Northeast refugees have their living expenses? In the icy and snowy frontier, the Volunteer Army is struggling to defend the survival of our nation, while Wang Lao Wu sits safely at home selling × goods, opening up financial resources for the enemy, then he is really not as good as a deer or pig, so there is still talk of "conscience"?</p>
<p>If you do not understand the question of "is personal interest important"? Or "is national interest important?" is clearly understood, then what goods can only be sold? Aren't the likes of Puyi and Zheng Xiaoxu also called "people"?</p>

<p>In yesterday's letter from Mr. Li Tianfang, the word "商" (merchant) in the first sentence, "I am a merchant," should be a mistake for the word "庸" (mediocre). This correction is hereby made.</p>

<h3>Superintendent Zhou Fo-hai of the Jiangsu Education Department Inspects Northern Jiangsu (3)</h3>
<p>Holds Public Lecture</p>
<p>Continues Inspecting Schools</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent from Nantong) Since arriving in Nantong, Zhou Fo-hai, Superintendent of the Jiangsu Education Department, has been inspecting education tirelessly, day and night. Today (the 3rd), he was jointly invited by all the major middle and elementary schools and the Education Bureau of the city to give a public lecture. At 8 a.m., Superintendent Zhou, along with his staff who came to Nantong, took time to visit the park. When they arrived at the Nantong Theater, the lecture venue, more than three thousand teachers, students, and educational administrators had already arrived, marking the first grand occasion of public gatherings in Nantong's history. First, Chairman Zhang, the County Magistrate, gave a solemn introductory speech. Then, Mr. Zhou took the stage, and the audience applauded, giving him a warm welcome. The main points of his speech were roughly divided into three sections. The first section briefly described the historical value of Nantong's developed education and industry, regretting its decline due to the impact of the world's economic trends. Therefore, he expressed hope that the revival of Nantong is the common responsibility of the people of Nantong, especially the educational sector, which bears an even greater responsibility. He also said that the revival of Nantong is the starting point for the Chinese nation to rise, hoping that the Nantong education sector would make special efforts. The second section briefly stated that today's China is plagued by three ills: chaos, poverty, and lack of knowledge. These three are mutually causal. Social instability leads to chaos, undeveloped industry leads to poverty, and educators abandoning their responsibilities leads to a lack of knowledge among the general populace. However, because of the lack of knowledge among the people, industry has failed to develop and society has failed to stabilize. The failure of education to fulfill its mission is the root cause of poverty and chaos. In the past, Nantong's industry was</p>
<p>developed, and society was stable, thanks to the great contribution of education. He deeply hoped that in the future, the spirit of creation and construction of the predecessors would be carried forward to revive Nantong, which is the way to save China. The third section briefly stated that the purpose of education is to save the country, and saving the country requires talent. Talent must possess the following three conditions: first, abundant knowledge; second, sound personality; and third, correct thinking. The mission of education itself is to impart knowledge, cultivate personality, and guide thinking. None can be lacking. The best way for students to save the country is only through studying and cultivating personality. It is necessary to promote our country's inherent virtues, and to know etiquette and abide by order. Young people should concentrate on the belief in the Three Principles of the People, and strive to study and be good people with the spirit of "Saving the country requires studying, and studying is saving the country," in order to save the country. Finally, he comforted the educational administrators and teachers, saying that in today's society where industry is declining, there must be "two people eating one person's food, and one person doing two people's work" for China to have a solution. The lecture lasted for two hours, and the audience listened attentively without fatigue, showing great unity. In the afternoon, he inspected various places. He first went to the county's sports field. It happened to be the ball game between Tongzhong and Chongjing schools. He watched for a while and then went to the County Women's Normal School. It was Saturday afternoon and classes were already over. Principal Luo of the school led him to inspect the school buildings and equipment, and the extracurricular activities of the female students. He then inspected the Memorial Elementary School set up by the school for a week. Then he went to the County Normal School (this school was the first normal school established in our country, having been established for more than 30 years, producing many outstanding talents) to inspect military training, calligraphy and other classes, and school buildings. As it was getting late, he hurried to the Agricultural Science Department of Nantong College to visit. The college gate was covered with slogans welcoming Superintendent Zhou. Li Yongxing, the head of the agricultural science department, Zhang Wenqian, the head of the textile department, and professors Wang Zhaocheng and Lin Bingzheng came out to greet him and led him to visit various laboratories, explaining in detail, and presented various publications. Then he went to inspect the middle school attached to the college. On both sides of the gate, a couplet was hung high, "Saving the country requires studying, and studying is saving the country," which was quite eye-catching. After the inspection, it was already dusk and there was a light rain, so he returned to his residence. That evening at eight o'clock, he gathered more than two hundred people from the elementary school circles in the city to give instructions, and they dispersed at ten o'clock. It is expected that tomorrow morning, he will start inspecting rural elementary schools and public education centers, and then visit Wolf Mountain and pay homage to Mr. Zhang Jian's tomb.

<h3>Educational Delegation Passing Through Paris, Cheng Qibao Expresses Opinions</h3>
<p>China Should Adopt the Best Education Systems from Various Countries as Appropriate</p>
<p>The Investigation Team Will Go to Italy and Austria for Investigation</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 4th Telegram. It was previously reported that the Chinese Educational Delegation had been inspecting educational institutions in Lyon. Mr. Cheng Qibao, the head of the delegation, passed through Paris and told the reporter that the delegation went to the Rhone region to investigate rural issues and rural education issues after visiting Lyon. There are five members in the delegation. Although they should make a report together after the investigation, each person has specialized research issues, namely: sociology, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and technical education. China pays special attention to rural issues, because most of the Chinese people are farmers. Chinese farmers cannot immediately adopt the methods used in Western agriculture. The only way to make progress is to seek it gradually. The delegation will go to Italy and Austria for investigation. Mr. Cheng believes that each country has its own special education methods. China does not want to copy those that are not suitable for the Chinese national character. Each country should have its own inherent education, but it is also possible to refer to and adopt the advantages of other countries to seek improvement. In recent years, China's education system has purely imitated the United States. Although there has been remarkable progress, China also wants to refer to the best systems of various European countries and adopt them as appropriate in order to achieve better results. The delegation's investigation has just begun, so Mr. Cheng cannot make a general critique of his observations, but only express his personal opinions on certain points. Mr. Cheng said that the Chinese people are diligent in their work, and are always happy, which is very similar to the French national character. Mr. Cheng said that he will go to England for investigation, and he will definitely find something very interesting there. At that time, recalling the visits to Lyon and Rhone, he will feel even more beneficial. When saying goodbye, Mr. Cheng agreed to meet again when he returns to France.</p>

<h3>20th Anniversary of Guangzhao Public School</h3>
<p>Guangzhao Public School held its 20th anniversary celebration yesterday morning at the Rongguang Grand Theater. More than 2,600 students, parents, and alumni attended the meeting. The meeting started at 9:30 a.m. After the ceremony, Principal (founder) Lu Songqian gave a speech, reporting on the school's 20-year history and future development plans. Next, Li Dachao, the representative of Mayor Wu, Guo Shun, the director of the school, Li Heyun, the representative of the parents of the students, and Zheng Jiaju, the representative of the alumni, gave speeches in succession. The celebration ended with the screening of a self-made film of the school and a Rongguang sound film. The speeches of Mayor Wu's representative and School Director Guo Shun are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Speech by Li Dachao, Representative of Mayor Wu: Today is the 20th anniversary of the founding of Guangzhao Public School. I am very happy to be here on behalf of Mayor Wu to participate in this grand commemorative ceremony. Mayor Wu has always been very concerned about the events of Guangzhao Public School and is very willing to take responsibility together with his fellow villagers to expand this school to create a large-scale, fully equipped, and especially focused on the use of what is learned, to educate useful young people who can be producers and creators and be the most powerful and healthy backbone of today's society. Therefore, when he was the head of the Shanghai Municipal Government, he planned to promote this plan as a place for the education of young children of his fellow villagers, because he cares about education and always pays attention to the education of Guangzhao Public School. We have previously organized the Guangzhao Middle School Fundraising Committee, and Mayor Wu, in his busy schedule, served as the chairman to preside over the fundraising matters. I followed Mayor Wu and knew that he was most concerned about and worked hard for the expansion of Guangzhao Middle School, because he often told me that school education is the life of the country, and Guangzhao Middle School is the life of our Cantonese fellow villagers. In any case, we must strive to realize our ideal education in order to say that we have fulfilled a little responsibility. In this commemorative meeting, I don't have any good intentions to tell everyone, I'm very sorry. Also, Mayor Wu has a tracheal inflammation and cannot talk too much, so he asked me to participate as a representative. I hope that the villagers will forgive me.</p>
<p>▲Speech by School Director Guo Shun: Today I am very happy to participate in such a grand meeting. Among the commemorative meetings I have participated in, this is the first time that there have been so many people and it has been so lively. Looking back over the past 20 years, Guangzhao Public School has cultivated a lot of talents. However, the villagers' faith is very deep, and their expectations are very high. There are more than 200,000 villagers in Shanghai, but there is no complete middle school, and the dissatisfaction is well-founded. Guangzhao Public School plans to add a high school, which has been actively carried out by Mayor Wu and others, and there should be satisfactory results. I am also one of the fundraising committee members, and I will do my best to do it, and I also ask all parents and alumni to take responsibility together.</p>
<h3>Fifth Day of Family Education Lecture</h3>
<p>The Great East Bookstore's family education lecture was the fifth day yesterday. It was given by Chen Heqin, the director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, and the topic was "Experiments in Family Education." The main points were to tell us what should not be taught to children. There are several most important things: one, do not scare children; two, do not often scold children; three, do not hit children. Do not teach him like this. So how should we teach him? There are also several most important things: one, parents should set an example; two, teach him using a game-style method; three, children should move and do it themselves; four, teach children using a positive method; five, always encourage children. Regarding these issues, Mr. Chen gave examples during his speech, which were very thorough and worthy of being an expert in children's education research. It is heard that today's lecture is given by Dong Renjian, a professor at Daxia University, on "How Should Family Education Be Implemented?" This topic is very important for children's education, and there will definitely be more listeners.</p>

In the first ten minutes of the second half, the situation was quite tense, with each team scoring and losing equally. However, in the last ten minutes, the Pirates performed beautifully, improving steadily and greatly increasing their score. Although Jiangwan tried hard to resist, the effect was minimal. As a result, the Pirates won 72-29. The record can be considered high.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers School on Julai Road held a dance performance for two nights, the 3rd and 4th, at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Visitors were exceptionally enthusiastic in recent days, and there were no remaining seats in the venue. Among the programs, such as the Pirate Dance Masquerade Bixiao, the highlights were evident. In the Stepping Dance, the sailor suits sang cheerful dances, which were very similar to the excitement of the navy. Others like the Magpie Bridge Meeting, were folk tales, compiled into dances that deeply resonated with the psychological mood of the guests. The main characters, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, contained tender feelings when they rejoiced. After the separation, they were bleak and heartbroken. The expressions were all appropriate. It is reported that the school spent a lot of money on this meeting.</p>
<h3>New Basketball Techniques (4) (O)</h3>
<p>(Not to be reprinted)</p>
<p>— Translated and jointly edited by Clairou Burcky, Zhang Guodong, and Qian Yiquan</p>
<p>The coach of the University of Arkansas has taught a reformed attacking method, in which four players insert themselves into the enemy's formation, disrupting their lines and allowing the fifth player to bring the ball into the opponent's zone and achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Number 4 passes the ball to Number 5. Number 5 first dribbles to the left and then turns and passes to Number 2 (Number 2 must move forward to receive the ball at this time). Numbers 1 and 3 run towards the arc of the free throw line at the same time, but the purpose of Number 1 is to block the path of Number 3's defender, allowing Number 3 to advance to the free throw area to receive Number 2's pass. Number 3 can then shoot directly or pass to Number 2 when Number 2 has escaped their defender.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>"New Basketball Techniques" consists of a total of forty articles, detailing the latest basketball tactics in the United States, which are very suitable for research by comrades in the Chinese basketball community. The full text has already been published. In response to readers' requests, a separate edition will be issued. — Editor's Note</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Ministry of Education's Reorganization of National Education in the Past Nine Months (1)</h3>
<p>I. General Remarks</p>
<p>Since Qi Jiahua accepted the important task and took on the responsibility of educational administration, for the past nine months, he has been diligently following the intentions of the central government. Together with his colleagues, he has worked conscientiously to continue the efforts of his predecessors and strive for advancement. With regard to established regulations and old systems, all of which were planned and managed by his predecessors, he has not dared to make any changes easily unless they have been proven to have drawbacks through actual implementation. Therefore, all reforms have been carried out with utmost caution, gathering collective wisdom and striving to ensure that they bring more benefits than harm and are practical and easy to implement. However, within the possible scope of these reforms, Jiahua and his colleagues still hold a consistent direction, persevering and tirelessly seeking its realization. What is this direction? It is to emphasize national rejuvenation in order to vigorously reorganize and improve national education. As for the purpose of education in the Republic of China, it has been determined by the central government. However, in order to implement this purpose and enable national education to follow this purpose and achieve improvement, practical measures must be adopted to suit the times, following the purpose of education. Otherwise, even if the purpose of education has been determined, it will be difficult to expect it to benefit reality. It is believed that China must focus on national rejuvenation in education for the entire nation to be free. As for education itself, it must vigorously reorganize step by step in order for education to achieve significant results. China's national rejuvenation must rely on education in two aspects: one is to cultivate the national concept of the people, and the other is to restore the national self-confidence of the people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said to catch up with the world's culture and save the Chinese nation from its roots. He also said that the revival of the Chinese nation must promote national unity and restore national self-confidence. These two posthumous teachings have a consistent meaning. China must catch up with world culture, but to catch up with world culture, it must first save the Chinese nation. To save the Chinese nation, it must first promote national unity and restore national self-confidence. It is undeniable that Chinese society lacks organization and discipline. Individual freedom is regarded as common, so all elements of the group are extremely lacking. As a result, the nation is like a heap of loose sand, losing its spirit of unity and progress. If education does not take the cultivation of national concepts as its main content, it will be impossible to correct this. In recent years, China has rapidly introduced Western culture without carefully choosing it. As a result, it is busy copying and following, and eventually, any system, cultural relics, ideas, or academic theories become like oranges north of the river when they come to China. This is all due to the loss of national self-confidence. Since the people have forgotten their nation's inherent culture, they lose their autonomy in absorbing foreign culture, and they lack a foundation for creating new culture. Culture must be created, and creation must be based on inherent culture. Without this foundation, the integration of world culture has no source, and catching up with it is out of the question. If education does not take the cultivation of national self-confidence as its main content, it will be impossible to correct this. This is the purpose of improving national education by focusing on national rejuvenation. Today, the development of national education is unbalanced, and its actual content is flowing into emptiness. Higher education suffers from extravagance, while primary education is still difficult to promote. Liberal arts education suffers from parallel construction, while practical science education is still difficult to develop. Secondary schools are expanding daily, while vocational and teacher training is diminishing. Schools are concentrated in cities but lacking in rural areas. This is the imbalance in the development of national education. Schools at all levels are focused on ostentation, wasting expenses, setting up courses without focusing on the basics, lacking equipment without seeking to improve it, poor teaching leads to lower student levels, and poor moral education leads to worse school discipline. This is the emptiness of the actual content of national education. These two phenomena are also mutually reinforcing causes. Therefore, the more empty the content, the faster the development, and eventually the entire education becomes a waste and chaos. The only way to reverse this accumulated burden is to vigorously reorganize, regulate its development, so that there is a sense of urgency, and to enrich its content, so that it can be practical and effective. Otherwise, if the content is lacking and the development is deformed without correction, then each additional development will add an additional layer of error to the entire education. The more development, the greater the error, and the deeper the poisoning. All these points are the fundamental direction of the Ministry's improvement of national education. Since February of this year, all the facilities of the Ministry, whether they have been implemented successively or are still being planned separately, have been held to this purpose as a standard for selection. I will present them separately.</p>
<p>II. Promoting Compulsory Education and Improving Primary School Education</p>
<p>Building the lower-level foundation of the nation lies in the popularization of education. Compulsory education and primary school education are the key plans for the popularization of education. Any country that wants to seek the popularization of education must promote primary school education to become compulsory education. However, China's primary school education has not been well managed, and social economy and local finances are extremely impoverished. Compulsory education and primary school education cannot be combined into one. Therefore, we must fully improve primary school education and simultaneously promote compulsory education. To improve primary school education, the Ministry has already revised the Primary School Organization Law and Primary School Regulations. The Primary School Regulations include strict provisions on local education research, the organization of primary schools, the allocation of funds, the enrichment of equipment, the reform of moral education, and the treatment and training of teachers. In particular, the curriculum has been issued detailed standards, with special emphasis, in order to enable existing primary schools to follow these various regulations and enrich their content with scientific methods. As for compulsory education, the Ministry has promulgated the General Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education in the First Phase and the General Outline of Measures for Implementing Short-Term Compulsory Education. The Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education in the First Phase stipulate that junior primary schools are compulsory education, in order to gradually implement it by year and region, first with experiments and then with promotion, so that in the future, junior primary schools will be universally established and become compulsory education. At present, there are more than 30 million out-of-school children aged ten to sixteen in China. If they are all to receive four years of compulsory junior primary school education, not only will the annual funding of 300 million yuan be impossible to raise, but also the 1.4 million primary school teachers cannot be trained in a hurry. Therefore, it is necessary to divide the years and regions, experiment and promote it, and gradually seek to establish it universally. However, this method alone is not enough to meet the urgent need. Therefore, the Measures for Implementing Short-Term Compulsory Education is also used to provide urgent relief to a large number of out-of-school children. This method shortens the compulsory education period to one year of short-term primary school, using a purely class-based system, so that out-of-school children aged ten to sixteen who are busy working and farming can also take time to study. The curriculum aims to literacy, and only sets up one type of national language, including common sense numeracy, making it particularly simple. Therefore, the Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education in the First Phase defines compulsory education as four years, which is intended to gradually promote it, making it easy to increase to six years and then increase to more than six years, in order to show a permanent plan. The Measures for Implementing Short-Term Compulsory Education temporarily sets one year as short-term compulsory education, which is intended to make it universally established, making it easy to implement compulsion, in order to meet the urgent need. At present, the number of out-of-school students in the country is too large, and national affairs are deteriorating daily. The promotion of compulsory education cannot be allowed to be leisurely delayed. We must gradually promote it without making other urgent remedies.</p>

<h3>Securities and Short-Term Finance Market Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Bonds Showed a Rebound</p>
<p>The Trend Was Very Chaotic</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), in the bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, only the current month of the 20-year financial short-term public bonds opened. Transactions were scarce and the price was very high. The popularity of other bonds in the morning and afternoon markets was still quite active, but there were only scattered spot transactions. The bond trend was very chaotic, with some rising and others falling, and large fluctuations. There was no consistent trend between the different trading sessions. The overall situation was dull and there were no new developments in the environment. Although there were many transactions, people's minds were unsettled. The rise and fall of prices only shifted with the temporary supply and demand situation in the market. Buying interest once again dominated the situation, with a rebound compared to the previous week. Bonds such as Disarmament, Taxes, Consolidated Tax, and 20 Customs rose by more than one yuan each, while others rose by about half a yuan. Due to the lack of recent transactions, spot trading for 6% and Tax bonds fell significantly. Futures trading totaled 5.6 million in the morning and over 3.8 million in the afternoon, totaling 9,415,000 yuan. Spot trading totaled 26,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>According to a report from a New York firm, the New York stock market on Saturday (the 3rd) initially declined due to the weakness of the British pound, but rebounded due to a good freight report. The number of freight cars during the week totaled 493,882, a decrease of 81,969 compared to the previous week, likely due to the Thanksgiving holiday. However, it was still considered good compared to last year. There were no changes in the war debt issue, which was basically whether or not to pay. According to the current stock market situation, it has approached the support line created between October and November. Some selling occurred last week due to the war debt issue, but the selling pressure was not strong, so the decline was also weak. Major holders clearly did not want to sell hastily, expecting the situation to improve in the future and the market to rise. Therefore, although the current situation is poor, it seems unnecessary to sell. If one holds blue-chip stocks, such as ordinary shares of Diamond Match and preferred shares of General Motors, there is even a reason to buy. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 5.83 Down 0.08</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 24.53 Down 0.24</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Mostly Dumping</h3>
<p>Yarn Warehouse Inventory Reaches 8,9000 Bales</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, but the trend was still scattered, with no sign of recovery. Due to the deterioration of the environment, the actual demand in the market was stagnant, and various promotions were ineffective, leading to widespread fatigue and a tendency to sell. However, some, due to their small base, did not dare to dump excessively. According to a survey of yarn and cloth warehouses, there are reportedly 89,000 bales of 20-count yarn of the "Ren Zhong Cai Hua," "San Yang," and "Fu Gui" brands. With such a huge amount of inventory, the pressure on the yarn market is increasing.</p>
<h3>Ren Biao (Cotton Futures) Market Slightly Settled in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Ren Biao market opened lower in the morning due to the further decline of American cotton. The sentiment in the market was more cautious, with prices falling by 5-6 cents across various months. A rebound was seen in the second and third trading sessions, resulting in a decrease of 2-5 cents across various months. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their short positions, and the market sentiment slightly calmed, with prices rising by 1-3 cents across various months. The total volume of transactions for the day was 16,200 bales. Yi Chang sold 1,350 bales, Yu Yu 900 bales, and Sui Jiang 600 bales. Shen Xin bought 750 bales, Shen Ji 700 bales, Tong He 550 bales, Yong Ren 350 bales, and Da Chang 350 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>February 1412 Up 1 50,750 Total 248,250</p>
<h3>Spot Market Relatively Active</h3>
<p>The spot yarn market was more active than the previous day. According to statistics, various merchant groups purchased a total of 858 bales for the day. The market was average. The purchase volume of each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 390 Zhenjiang 5 Fujian 5 Jiangxi 35 Da Feng 5</p>
<p>Ningbo 17 Fellow Traders 5 Shantou 10 Guangdong 45 Hankou 326</p>
<p>Xiamen 15</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Situation Still Stable</h3>
<p>Arrivals are Scarce, Prices are Firm</p>
<p>Not Influenced by Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market experienced a weakening trend due to the further decline of American cotton and the increasing decline of Indian cotton. However, as the arrival of goods from various regions was limited and there were not many new sellers in the market, and prices in Hankou, Tianjin, Jinan, Zhengzhou, and other places were difficult to lower, the current domestic cotton market remained high despite the decline in overseas markets. However, due to the financial emergency and the fatigue of the yarn market, factories had no intention of making large-scale purchases, so the overall trend remained a sideways market.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao (Cotton Futures) Market Initially Soft, Then Recovered</h3>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened lower in the morning, with the decline in the American and Indian markets causing a slight downturn in market sentiment. Prices fell by 1 cent across various months. In the afternoon, there were reports that some factories purchased more than 1,000 pieces of spot cotton, causing the market situation to tighten slightly. Prices rose by 0.5-1 cent across various months. The total volume of transactions for the day was 29,600 dan. Da Feng sold 2,800 dan, Sheng Tai 2,500 dan, Rong Xing 1,300 dan, and Chang He 1,200 dan. Yi Chang bought 1,000 dan, Yi Yu 1,100 dan, Da Chang 1,300 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 2,400 dan, and Yi Feng 1,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Uniformly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton declined due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Foreign merchants sold, and selling pressure caused the market to weaken. Futures fell by 6-12 points, and spot goods fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 12 points, and spot goods fell by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 22 points. Indian cotton weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls. Ping Guo Er fell by 6.75 rupees, Om La fell by 6.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 6.25 rupees. The original telegraphic records are on the left (dated the 3rd):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent Shen Regulation British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent Shen Regulation</p>
<p>December 560 Down 627.60 1 492 Down 21.90</p>

<h3>Indian Cotton Sales Still Smooth</h3>
<p>│Silver Price Drop Benefits Exports│</p>
<p>(Bombay) The gap between Indian and American prices widened further last week, benefiting exports, due to the drop in silver prices. Japanese merchants purchased futures cotton, mainly Om La. The Japanese purchases are the main reason for maintaining the Indian-American price difference. Besides Japan, the demand for Indian cotton is minimal. Local factories are also weak. The weather is unstable, but it benefits Om La. New cotton arrivals are delayed due to the shipment of Indian gold to America. The statistics for last week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1921 1922</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts from September 1st 179 245</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 363 00</p>
<p>Cumulative exports from September 1st 27 229</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 55 81</p>
<p>Shipped to China 87 │</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 25 144</p>
<p>Other regions 16 4</p>
<p>(Liverpool) Spot demand remained unchanged last week. Futures declined due to political factors and the weakness of Egyptian cotton. The amount of profit-taking and hedging could not be fully absorbed by the industry. Therefore, even with the low silver prices, it could only maintain the status quo. Egyptian cotton weakened due to unfavorable news from American cotton and Asia.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Rises by One Dime</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, there were not many sources from various groups due to the wind and rain, only about 30 suppliers. The inventory in Pu Dong was also substantial. Tianjin-based merchants purchased 2,000 bags of "Bao Zi" rice for several consecutive days, pushing the situation upwards. Early rice and northern japonica rice both rose by about one dime. High-quality "Yang Jian" rice was sold at the same price, with no rise or fall. Although the supply of "Yin Hua" rice was limited, the liquor stores were satisfied, and the price remained stable.</p>
<p>(Xin Guan) Yesterday, there were not many sources from the west road, about 55-60 suppliers. There was limited activity in the morning due to light rain. Changshu northern japonica rice and Jiangyin rice were quoted up by one dime. The interest in thin rice was slightly active, with nearly 1,000 shi (unit of volume) of riverbed rice being traded.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian (Rice) Supply Will Exceed Demand</h3>
<p>│Arrivals Gradually Increase… Fujian Merchants' Appetite Remains Strong│</p>
<p>│After Du Rice is Exported North… Foreign Rice May Have a Chance│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was active and sales were strong. The market seemed to be on the path to a lively state. However, as arrivals exceeded sales, prices tended to decline. Yesterday, new arrivals of Ke Yuan and Ke Xian rice from Anhui and Hunan provinces totaled around 5,000 bags, with only half being sold. Therefore, although the market sentiment was good, the price declined by about one dime. Ke Yuan was especially weaker due to the influence of new riverbed rice and rice stored from Jiangxi machine rice mills. Wu machine rice was previously sold at a high of 10 yuan and 7.5 jiao and 11 yuan. Last week, it was still quoted at 10 yuan. Yesterday, it fell to below 9 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 jiao. Anqing machine rice, with lower quality, was even weaker. The unified market price for 770 bags of Wu machine rice was 9 yuan and 9 jiao to 8.5 jiao. 270 bags of Anqing machine rice were priced at 8 yuan and 2.5 jiao to 2 jiao. 150 bags of Jiangxi late rice were priced at 8 yuan and 3 jiao. 1,000 bags of Hunan "Yan Jing" rice were priced at 7 yuan and 3.9 jiao to 2.5 jiao. 300 bags of Hunan "Po Hong" rice were priced at 7 yuan to 6 yuan and 9 jiao. Among them, the Jiangxi machine late rice was purchased by merchants from Quanzhou, Fujian province. The remaining rice was purchased by merchants from Fujian province. The appetite of Fujian merchants remained strong, and it was necessary to continue active purchases. However, Northern merchants, due to the potential for export of Du japonica rice from this province and Zhejiang, shifted their attention. In the future, the export of Ke Xian rice to the north may disappear. Ke Xian arrivals gradually increased, but sales relied solely on Fujian merchants. There was a risk of oversupply. However, after the export of Du japonica rice to the north, the sales of foreign rice in this street may have a new lease of life.</p>
<h3>Biao Fen (Flour) Hovers with a Softening Trend</h3>
<p>│Heard Large Factories Agreed to Purchase Two More Shipments of Coast Wheat│</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for various months initially showed a tired and then stable trend. As foreign wheat prices declined by about one dime, the market sentiment was not good when the opening prices were quoted. Near-term prices were lower by about 0.5%. However, as factories were not selling well and outside sentiment remained good, it stabilized again. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for various months hovered and began to show a softening trend. Tianjin merchants continued to sell out, and Australian foreign wheat was recently active again. It was heard that large factories agreed to purchase two more shipments at prices ranging from 3 taels and 5 qian to 3 taels, 5 qian, 3-4 fen. Xin Da has newly arrived with over 3,000 tons of foreign wheat. It seems that current production can already meet demand, so the market sentiment gradually weakened. The future rise and fall will depend on how actual sales perform. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, while prices for January and February fell by 0.25%, and prices for March, April, and May fell by 0.5%.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Remains On The Sidelines</h3>
<p>│Soon Foreign Wheat Will Be Imported in Large Quantities│</p>
<p>│The Position of Domestic Wheat Will Inevitably Be Shaken│</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the afternoon, the market for various months again tended to hover. Foreign wheat prices showed little fluctuation. Buyers and sellers remained on the sidelines. Trading was unusually scarce in the morning. The afternoon was slightly busier. February and March initially showed firmness. It was reported that there were new transactions of foreign wheat, and the price fell by 0.2 fen. There were very few transactions in April, and the market tended to stabilize. With the imminent large-scale import of foreign wheat, the position of domestic wheat would inevitably be shaken. As a result, only April was slightly better by 0.1 fen, with no comparison for the others.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Bulls Take Profits</h3>
<p>According to a report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm, Chicago wheat on Saturday (the 3rd) initially rose due to the poor condition of the Argentine wheat crop, but then fell due to profit-taking by bulls. A total of 3,000 bushels were traded on the 2nd. The market prices for the 2nd are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 43.375 Down 0.25</p>
<p>May 47.750 Down 0.25</p>
<p>July 47.875 Down 0.25</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Domestic Qing Sugar Transactions Still Numerous</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday saw a stabilization of the trend with the decline in the Biao Jin (tariff). The association's market price for Grade 24 coarse sand white common sugar was initially 15 taels and 6 qian, which later dropped to 5 qian and 7.5 fen, with hundreds of bags transacted. The price of high-grade sugar was 15 taels and 7 qian, the price of Grade 20 medium sand white sugar was 14 taels and 8 qian, and the price of Grade 18 medium sand white sugar was 14 taels and 5 qian, with little fluctuation. The market for Dutch red sugar remained tight, with Grade 8 sugar priced at 11 taels and 6.5 qian to 7 qian, Grade 9 sugar at 11 taels and 8 qian, and Grade 10 sugar at 11 taels and 9 qian. Merchants from Guangdong offered 900 pieces of secondary Qing sugar at a price of 8 taels per bag and 15 taels and 3.5 qian. Merchants from Shantou offered over 1,000 bags of Mian Hu red sugar over the past two days at a price of 11 taels, and secondary sugar at 10 taels and 6 qian. Merchants from Jian offered dozens of boxes of high-grade hand-made ice sugar, with each block priced at 10 taels and 2 qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Zhen Mei Green Tea Sales Slightly Active in France</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhen Mei green tea from Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang and other areas saw slightly more active sales in France. However, the opening market prices for tea from Tunxi were 70 taels within the customs, and the price for tea from Wenzhou and Yushan was 31-32 taels, a further decline of 2-3 taels compared to before. There was little progress for tea from Yiyuan. There was some interest in Gong Xi, with High Zhuang and Low Zhuang tea, Bai Tou Zhuang, Qian Yi Yu Jiang, and other firms all showing interest. Transactions were not quiet. However, there were no transactions in the Middle Customs tea because Russian firms had excessively harsh prices.</p>

<h3>Newlywed Night (5)</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>"What is there to be ashamed of? I simply won't go in. See what you can do? I haven't stolen a man or robbed anyone's belongings. What am I afraid of?"</p>
<p>This was truly beyond Aunt's expectations. She never imagined Miss Xiu would have such courage.</p>
<p>"Don't make a scene. You're not a child of three or five. Every woman has to marry."</p>
<p>Aunt's voice deliberately lowered a bit.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Why must I marry? Can't I live on my own? Even if I were to marry, which I won't for life, I would marry someone I want to marry. I won't be sold off by you! Hmph! Sold to a monkey older than my father! Oh God, I'm scared, I'm terrified!..."</p>
<p>More and more people gathered to watch the commotion. Aunt was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, at her wit's end. Miss Xiu was so worked up she was about to faint. Her tears had long since dried up, and suddenly a lot of fresh blood gushed from her nose.</p>
<p>"Quick, get some cotton!"</p>
<p>"It's alright, it's just the heat rising. It's not a big deal."</p>
<p>"This bride must have a fiery temper."</p>
<p>"You can't blame her. She's so pitiful, marrying such an old thing."</p>
<p>"Really, and so ugly!"</p>
<p>"And a miser who loves money more than life."</p>
<p>"Don't say that, shut your mouth."</p>
<p>"What's it to you!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>These were the noisy voices coming from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Aunt, thank you for being such a good matchmaker! I will die before your very eyes today! I will never go back to that old monkey. I'd rather... I'd rather die than, no, no... I don't want to see his face again!"</p>
<p>"Mom! Your efforts have been in vain. I will never yield, I will resist to the end! My life cannot be sold off by you, cannot be handed over to others to be slaughtered. I will dispose of myself, destroy myself..."</p>
<p>With a "bang," Miss Xiu slammed her head against the wall. The back of her head happened to hit a very small nail, only half an inch long, and blood spurted out like a waterfall. The crowd screamed in horror. Some sighed and shed tears of sympathy, while others rubbed their fists by the window, writing in big letters: "Damn old monkey, killing such a young and beautiful girl!"</p>
<p>Miss Xiu's blood continued to flow. The doctor had not yet arrived, and she had already fainted.</p>
<p>Afternoon, November 28, 1932</p>
<p>"Note 1": This is a dialect from Xinhua, Hunan. The first time a virgin has relations with a man is called "yuan fang".</p>
<p>"Note 2": A "stone woman" is a virgin whose physical structure is incomplete, making it impossible to have sexual relations with a man.</p>
<p>"Note 3": This describes the meaning of a beautiful woman marrying an ugly husband.</p>
<p>"Note 4": This says that older men know how to cherish their wives, while young people treat their wives as unimportant as grass.</p>
<h3>About Clothes</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Lately, when going to the bathhouse, I dread the attendant taking off my clothes the most. Although my suit, made five years ago, still looks like a garment on the outside, the inside is tattered and frayed. Even I feel embarrassed when I see it. My clothes are like this, so you can imagine my life. My friend T even wrote to me saying that I "imitate the bourgeoisie at sea in the ranks of the proletariat," which is truly an injustice!</p>
<p>Having spent so many years in society, and ending up like this, not even having proper clothes, you must criticize me, saying, "This is either too incompetent, or too lazy, definitely not contributing to society!" For me, perhaps that's all appropriate. I am willing to accept it. However, what about those skilled craftsmen, those farmers who toil like cattle and horses all day long, those soldiers who take a few dollars a month, or even nothing at all, and exchange their lives for a living? Are they useful materials? Are they hardworking individuals? Are their clothes adequate? I'm afraid having a tattered garment that can keep out the cold is already a great comfort! Can you put on a stern face and say, "Definitely not contributing to society?"</p>
<p>Or you might change your tune and say, "Their abilities are too limited." Really? Not so! What does "limited ability" mean? Those who amass the wealth of the people, those who swallow public funds and money, depositing entire batches of banknotes in foreign banks, spending snow-white silver dollars like flowing water, can this be called "great ability?" And those who inherit large estates, unable to carry anything on their shoulders or lift anything with their hands, useless in all things, yet they never worry about what to wear in winter or what to change into in summer: can this also be called "having ability?" Society is like this, can you say it's none of your business?</p>
<p>If you still insist on saying that it has nothing to do with society, then I have nothing to say. I can only blame myself for "being born at the wrong time," not being born as a rich or noble person, or the descendants of the rich, or the wives and concubines of the noble! Otherwise, I can only blame myself for "being born in the wrong place," not being born in the tropics, where a single pair of trousers can be worn year-round. However, even there, there are many poor people who can't even afford that one pair of trousers!</p>
<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>— Xingzi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I moved again. For the past half year, my wife has been constantly making a fuss about moving, saying either that there are too many bedbugs or that the mosquitoes are annoying. So we move back and forth, moving away and then moving back.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I can't help but laugh. Every time we move, I always say to my friends in this way or that way: "This house is so bad! I can't stand the bedbugs and mosquitoes!" And the new house is so good... I've said this more than once. At first, my friends would nod, expressing agreement. Now they're used to it and don't pay much attention no matter how enthusiastically I speak. I think moving is always good, because moving, to put it nicely, is a change of residence. Although bedbugs and mosquitoes don't break off relations with me just because I move, the two lines of poetry, "Coming from a secluded valley, moving to a tall tree," are, after all, so pleasing and sweet.</p>
<p>Speaking of moving, I'm reminded of two stories. One is "Mother Meng moved three times," but my little daughter is only four months old and not as mischievous as A Ke. Also, I don't expect the world to have another "Sage," so moving back and forth like Mother Meng seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>The second is that Duke Gu Danfu initially lived in Bin, but when the Di people invaded, he moved the entire nation to the foot of Mount Qi. Those who followed him were like those returning to the market. This was a vast and mighty relocation. But what harms this small child is only bedbugs and mosquitoes. And the only one who follows is a four-month-old daughter. I dare not presume to compare myself, and besides, this is a "matter of state," not something I should concern myself with. So, this can also be dismissed!</p>
<p>Since I don't want to compare myself to Mother Meng, and I don't dare to presume to imitate Duke Gu Danfu... Then what...? So, I remembered the saying from my hometown, "Monkeys moving their young." Good, let's just say it's "Monkeys moving their young!"</p>
<h3>The Eastward Deflection of Objects Falling from High Places</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Between 1546 and 1601 AD, the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe denied the Earth's rotation. He said: "If the Earth truly rotates from west to east, then objects falling from high places must fall slightly to the west of the point below." But at the time, no one could discover this phenomenon of falling objects deflecting westward. Later, in 1679, Newton and Hooke corresponded with each other to discuss this matter. As a result, falling objects deflected not westward but eastward. The first person to experimentally prove the eastward deflection of falling objects was the Italian physicist Guglielmini. In 1792, at the Tower of Degli Asinelli in Bologna (240 feet high), he dropped sixteen spheres, all of which landed slightly to the east.</p>
<p>Also, the German physicist Benzenberg, in 1802, dropped thirty-one spheres from the tower of St. Michael's Church in Hamburg (over 340 feet high). Eleven of them landed four lines to the east, which is about two minutes and seven li. The following year, he conducted this experiment in the vertical shaft of the Schlesebusch coal mine near Sprockhosvel. In 1831, the physicist Reich conducted 106 trials in the vertical shaft (about 480 feet deep) of the Dreibrüder in Freiberg, Saxony. All the spheres fell to the east. The average distance from the original position was twelve lines and two-fifths (about eight minutes and two li).</p>
<p>From the above experiments, it is known that the eastward deflection of falling objects is an undeniable fact. The reason for this, of course, is the Earth's rotation.</p>
<h3>Nurseries in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>— Ke Duo</p>
<p>Since Soviet Russia created a new system of government, many new things have emerged in society in the past eleven years. Now, when women in Soviet Russia have babies, they no longer need to hire wet nurses, or mix formula, or wash diapers. They simply send their newborns to the state-run nurseries, where nurses and nannies in white coats and white hats will raise them.</p>
<p>Nurseries are called "Yaslin" in Russian. Some translate it as "infant homes". In today's Soviet cities and villages, nurseries have been established in places with large populations.</p>
<p>These nurseries are either specially built or attached to workers' dormitories, large libraries, playgrounds, and clubs. They are always well-lit, well-ventilated, and designed according to scientific methods to ensure that children are in good health.</p>
<p>Generally, the nursery facilities begin with a small infant reception and dispatch room. This room is specifically for families to rest when dropping off and picking up infants. When parents bring their infants to the nursery, they first hand them over to a caregiver, who removes all their clothing, leaving not a single thread, and places the clothing in a closet about four feet high and five to six feet long. This small closet is divided into many small compartments, each of which is further divided into upper and lower compartments. The upper compartment is larger, and the lower compartment is smaller. Hats and clothing are placed in the upper compartment, and pants, socks, and shoes are placed in the lower compartment. Next to each compartment, the infant's name is written. One compartment is for one infant, and it is never mixed up. After these procedures are completed, the infant is taken to the examination room to be checked by a doctor for any illnesses. If there are any illnesses, the infant is sent to the ward. The ward is also divided into rooms for mild and severe illnesses. If the infant's illness is very serious, then the parents take them back and send them to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Infants without illnesses are placed in the common infant residence.</p>
<p>The sanitary facilities in the nursery are very complete, with medicine rooms, examination rooms, light illness rooms, and rooms for suspected illnesses. Infants with coughs and colds are not housed with healthy infants, but are placed in separate rooms. In the children's playroom, they play in groups according to their age, each group in a separate room with no more than eleven or twelve children, and a caregiver is specially assigned to manage them.</p>
<p>The bedrooms are also divided into two types: day bedrooms and night bedrooms. Day bedrooms usually have many windows, making it easy to absorb sunlight. Each bedroom contains fifteen or sixteen small white wire beds with railings. The beds have very clean white blankets, sheets, and mattresses. Before the infants go to sleep, they wear a sleeping garment that resembles a bag, slightly smaller at both ends and larger in the middle. After the infants fall asleep, only their heads are exposed, and all four limbs are wrapped in the bag, making it difficult for them to catch a cold. Before bedtime, the caregiver must check the thermometer to see how to open and close the small windows (because the climate in Soviet Russia is very cold, and in winter, all the windows are tightly sealed with paint and ash, with only a small window opened on the large window, which is often opened and closed to circulate air). The night bedroom is similar to the day bedroom, except that the infants wear a sleeping garment that is not a bag and is exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Infants' soiled clothing, sleeping garments, sheets, blankets, etc., are systematically washed every three days. In the summer, infants usually sleep outdoors during the day to get more sunlight. Caregivers bathe the infants every day, and the towels and soap used are separated for each person to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
<p>In addition to the necessary toys and bedding for infants, the walls of the bedrooms and playrooms are also decorated with pictures of animals, plants, landscapes, and so on, to create a sense of beauty for the children and cultivate a concept of art.</p>
<p>Children's diets have a certain time and quantity, and they are also separated according to age. The main foods are milk, eggs, and vegetables. Cooks must have the items they purchase inspected by a doctor before cooking and giving them to the children.</p>
<p>All staff members in the nursery wear white clothing during working hours. People who are not related are strictly prohibited from entering. People who go to the nursery to visit must also wear the white clothing provided by the nursery, and then be led in by the director or staff member, who will provide detailed explanations to the visitors.</p>
<p>Infants can only be raised in nurseries until the age of three. After the age of three, they must be sent to kindergarten.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>He pressed the doorbell at number 45 H Lane. After a while, a middle-aged man who looked like a head servant or a carriage driver, speaking with a northern accent, opened the iron gate and asked who he was. Haiquan gave him a name card and explained that he was a relative from Guangzhou. The man politely invited him into the parlor inside.</p>
<p>"Sir, you're early."</p>
<p>The handyman smiled and handed him a cup of hot tea.</p>
<p>"Early? It's past ten o'clock, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It just rang. The young master hasn't gotten up yet..."</p>
<p>As the handyman spoke, he saw that the room was very dim, so he turned on the electric lights. Haiquan looked at the furnishings in the room, which were quite luxurious, especially the wallpaper, which was extraordinarily bright. But even after ten o'clock, there was no sunlight to be seen. Such a residence was like hell or a prison. The first thing people need is air, and the second is sunlight. Living in such houses, they may not be considered happy.</p>
<p>"Hasn't the young mistress gotten up either?"</p>
<p>Haiquan really wanted to see this Sister Peizhen now, to see if her face and figure resembled his beloved Peizhu.</p>
<p>"If I marry Peizhu, then I and that Master Ren would be in-laws."</p>
<p>"They only went to sleep recently."</p>
<p>"What? They only went to sleep?"</p>
<p>"Didn't they? Last night, they played mahjong until five o'clock this morning. Each person ate a bowl of chicken noodle soup and drank half a cup of Korean ginseng soup before resting."</p>
<p>After saying that, the handyman showed a lewd smile on his face. From this smile, Haiquan sensed the decadence of Ren's couple's life.</p>
<p>"Maybe Peizhen and Master Ren's relationship is still very strong right now."</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel his cheeks flush. At the same time, he felt extremely embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll come back another day. They haven't gotten up yet. I don't want to disturb them."</p>
<p>"Is there anything important?"</p>
<p>The handyman had a Shandong accent.</p>
<p>"There's nothing."</p>
<p>As he said that, he walked towards the door. At the same time, he also envied Master Ren's couple's life. He felt a kind of contradiction.</p>
<p>"Playing mahjong until dawn! I really don't know what the taste of mahjong is like." He was about to walk out of the door.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, please wait a moment. The old maid just went up to serve. The young mistress said she would come down immediately and insisted that you wait a while..."</p>

<h3>Chinese Language Class</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>This publication aims to stimulate the interest of general students in the study of Chinese and to expose the dark situation in the education community. It has a section called "School Photos," so the contributors are all top students in schools, and the materials they write are mostly romantic situations of students, and otherwise, they are nothing more than materials for joking with teachers during Chinese language classes. This is not because the authors have any particular ill feeling towards Chinese language teachers. This is a general phenomenon in schools. What a heartbreaking thing this is.</p>
<p>Today, I will put aside the general romantic students for the time being, and I will also talk about "Chinese Language Class." I have also eaten from the public pot and served as a Chinese language teacher in middle schools and universities for several years. Because I rely on my seniority, students dare not make trouble for me, but I carefully investigate. The students who fundamentally believe in and like to study Chinese are truly a minority of the minority. When I saw this situation, I felt very sad.</p>
<p>Because language is the foundation of a country, cultural aggression is the only weapon of imperialists. Therefore, if you want to destroy a country, you must first destroy its language as a primary condition. Now that other countries have a tendency to gradually culturally invade our country, our culturally backward country naturally cannot resist. However, we should not forget our ancestors and first destroy our own language. Because although there are places in our culture that are not in line with the times, language is ultimately not on the list to be discarded.</p>
<p>I once asked the students why they have no faith in or interest in Chinese. They have several answers as follows:</p>
<p>1. We come to school to study English and mathematics as our main purpose. Assuming we want to study Chinese, there are many good teachers at home, so why spend so much money to come to school.</p>
<p>2. English and mathematics are relatively new and pleasing, while Chinese inevitably has a stale atmosphere. Moreover, in any profession, those who are proficient in English will definitely be treated better, and those who are not proficient in English will definitely be treated worse. This is also because of environmental pressure.</p>
<p>3. The higher the student's level, the more serious the English and mathematics courses become. Now, devoting all our brainpower to studying English and mathematics is not enough. Where can we find the time to study Chinese?</p>
<p>4. The scores in Chinese are the least accurate. As long as the writing is coherent, no matter what, we can always "pass." It is not as strict as the evaluation of English and mathematics.</p>
<p>These few answers are not wrong at all. Because of this, students treat Chinese as a conversation class, some as a novel reading class, some as a love letter writing class, and some as a tutoring class for various courses. Their views are like this. So, can they still have faith in Chinese language teachers? Can they still refrain from making trouble? However, to remedy this problem, it is not something that one side can be responsible for. Several parties need to be responsible.</p>
<p>1. Chinese language teachers must study teaching methods and teaching materials to stimulate students' interest in studying Chinese.</p>
<p>2. The school authorities should not focus solely on English and mathematics when allocating courses. They must ensure that various subjects develop equally.</p>
<p>3. We must reduce various boring courses so that students can focus their minds and attention on various important subjects.</p>
<p>Because of the three words "Chinese Language Class," I am reminded of the decline of Chinese studies in our country. Students are unwilling to study or disdain to study Chinese, so that there are college graduates whose Chinese writing is still incoherent. Therefore, I have hastily written down some of the random feelings I have gained, as a conversation.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Feelings on the Kunhu Road</h3>
<p>— Wang Fuding</p>
<p>A lonely city corner gathers ten thousand troops, rivers and mountains suddenly rise in wind and clouds. The heaven-supporting tree is like a strong general, with meritorious deeds of protecting the Hu in the past.</p>
<p>The water on Qingyang Port flows slowly, and no one can cross the hundred-foot floating bridge. The remains are full of tears, and the deep bones have endless hatred.</p>
<p>Important places cannot avoid enemy contention, and artillery fire ruthlessly turns tiles into rubble. A small window suddenly catches the eye, linking the vicissitudes of life to sorrowful feelings.</p>
<p>More than good bamboo and fertile fields have been destroyed. Sad wild geese are good to return to their dwellings after the chaos is settled. In the depths of spring, they compete to shovel the Hu ditches, and plant mulberry and hemp again, and plant vegetables again.</p>

<h3>How to Make Solid Alcohol</h3>
<p>— Gu Lushuang</p>
<p>Alcohol is a liquid at room temperature and is easily volatile. It only becomes solid at 130 degrees below zero Celsius. This temperature cannot be reached without special equipment. Even if it can be made solid, it cannot last long. Therefore, it is usually impossible to make solid alcohol.</p>
<p>With the development of science, it is often possible to find a way out of a dead end. This solid alcohol, which has a wide range of uses (details below), cannot be obtained at room temperature, so chemists use the principles of colloid chemistry to create a new way to manufacture it and provide it to the public. The reader is very willing to know how it is made.</p>
<p>There are many methods for making alcohol using colloid chemistry. Now, the two most effective and convenient methods are described separately:</p>
<p>First method</p>
<p>Preparation: Pour 85 cc of 95% alcohol into a cup. Pour 15 cc of a saturated solution of calcium acetate into another cup. This saturated solution of calcium acetate is made by dissolving calcium acetate in warm water until no more can be dissolved.</p>
<p>Method: Take another larger cup, hold each of the above cups containing the solution with both hands, and simultaneously pour the contents into the large cup. If the speed of both hands is the same when pouring, it will become a gel-like solid alcohol. To use, simply light it and it will burn. An old cigarette can can also be used to hold the solid alcohol, but it must be closed tightly when not in use.</p>
<p>The product obtained by the above method has residue after burning, while the one obtained by the second method has very little.</p>
<p>Second method</p>
<p>Preparation: Put one thousand parts of 90% alcohol into a glass container, 30 parts of dry soap flakes, and 2 parts of gum.</p>
<p>Method: Place the above container with alcohol on boiling water. The temperature of the contents of the cup should be 63 degrees Celsius, no higher. Then, put in the soap flakes and gum, mix and harmonize to dissolve the soap completely, pour into a cigarette can, and it will become solid alcohol after cooling.</p>
<p>The above two methods are very convenient to make. The author has personally done them and knows that they are very effective. In the cold winter weather, alcohol has many uses, and there are also many disasters caused by alcohol overturning. If solid alcohol is used, all dangers can be avoided, and the firepower is the same as liquid alcohol, and it is convenient to carry. Travelers appreciate it very much.</p>

<h3>Sketches of Several Teachers</h3>
<p>— Whirlpool</p>
<p>Mr. Xu, the Chinese language teacher, has a comical appearance: a swarthy face set off by a mop of frizzy, curly hair; a short body lost in baggy, slovenly clothes. His scholarship is not bad; he has some research in literature, philosophy, and philology; and his music is also excellent. When lecturing, he accompanies his words with hand and foot gestures, and he tells a lot of jokes, so he is very popular with the students. Because he is skilled in music, he actually sang an excerpt from the "Peach Blossom Fan" on the podium during a lesson, making everyone laugh until they doubled over.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, the English teacher, is still very young and a minor writer. He has published a magnum opus (?) and often has major works published in certain magazines, so he has the air of a literary figure. It is said that he used to be a teaching assistant at a certain university, so he has also learned the airs of a professor. After the bell rings for class, at least six or seven minutes must pass before he arrives leisurely with his large briefcase. As for his teaching method, I dare not flatter him, but because he is a writer? So students dare not despise him.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu, the mathematics teacher, is extremely handsome: shiny hair, a well-tailored Western suit, shiny black leather shoes... Ah, he has all the qualifications of a modern man! But, but his scholarship is too poor, especially his English proficiency is too low. Even the simplest mathematical exercises in English require him to explain them in a disjointed manner. However, he gives grades exceptionally generously, so students who "only look at grades" do not suffer. Moreover, he is very responsible; he has not missed a single class this semester, which can also be considered one of his strengths.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou, the history teacher, is a teacher whom the students both respect and fear. He is a large man, and his waddling gait is quite amusing. His Mandarin is very fluent, and he tells history as if he were telling a story, making it more and more interesting to listen to, so everyone loves to attend his class. However, his exams are the most severe. His sharp gaze shines everywhere, making everyone afraid to look directly at him and afraid to cheat.</p>
<p>There is also a Mr. Chen, the geography teacher, who is like a virgin: extremely shy. If a student says a teasing word to him, his face immediately turns red, but he never gets angry. His voice is very soft, and he is very nearsighted. Because he is a Ningbo native, his most common phrase is "A-la." A certain mischievous student counted the number of times he said these two words in one lesson and found that it was more than forty times!</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of the Concubines</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>"Mr. Ronggui, not only do you hope that the commander will soon assume a new position, but we are even more eager!" The nineteen-year-old Third Concubine, seeing Mr. He Ronggui, who was staying at the commander's house waiting for a job, with a worried face, said娇娇ly like this:</p>
<p>"Yes, we are even more eager!" The Fourth Concubine, who was actually two years older, repeated抢声重一句; the Fifth Concubine continued滔滔to say:</p>
<p>"You know, Mr. Ronggui, when our commander had not yet made his fortune,驻紥in XX province and was a civil official│concurrent chairman, how pleasant we were! A monthly allowance of three or five thousand was not a problem; the comfort of food and clothing was beyond words. Even when he was demoted to brigade commander the year before last, it was still acceptable. Now it has been reduced to only fifty yuan of pocket money per month, which is simply useless for anything. After seeing a play, you can't play mahjong again. Recently, even our previous private savings have almost all been used up. Last month, the First Wife went to Hankou to inquire about the commander's news, and we were full of hope! As long as the commander's matter is successful, we don't care about being under her control or receiving her cold looks. It's just that there has been no news since she left. Speaking of the commander, he is still an outsider! As long as his pockets are full, he is still generous, and his requests are always granted. Is that right, Mr. Ronggui?"</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right, especially for you. Even when I used to ask the commander for money, thirty or fifty would often be in hand as soon as I spoke," Mr. Ronggui replied. The Second Concubine brought in the mahjong, and everyone gathered around. The atmosphere in the room suddenly changed immediately.</p>
<p>The XX commander was originally a beggar sleeping in a temple廊in XX county, XX province. In the summer of the thirteenth year, because he stole a pumpkin from Li Si of Zhangjiawan, the village head and security chief decided to drive him out of the area. He drifted to XX province to become a soldier. "The situation creates heroes." Relying on his lantern-sized courage, he quelled bandits and resisted rebels, always successfully. In less than two years, he rose from soldier... to platoon leader... to company commander. In the fifteenth year, he dispatched troops to XX, and the discipline was so strict. Seeing merit and rewarding it, he bravely took on the task of right-wing assault. Sure enough, he was invincible and victorious in every battle, and he quickly rose to the rank of commander. At that time, he thought, "I don't really understand revolution. It's better to save more money and secretly marry a few young wives." So the Second Concubine, Third Concubine... Sixth Concubine also entered the commander's mansion one after another. Later, the commander was ordered to concurrently serve as provincial chairman. He clearly held a position in both military and political affairs.</p>
<p>That was probably because he was, after all, a military man by origin and easily tempted. Two representatives sent by the XX military commander of a neighboring province told him that if he wanted great hope, he should defect. He listened and thought, "That's right. If I want great hope, I should..." So he raised the flag and betrayed反 XX. The facts are always unpredictable, and it completely collapsed. This was the matter of the eighteenth year.</p>
<p>Finally, enduring until June of the nineteenth year, he made many turns and obtained a position as an independent brigade commander,驻紥in the wealthy XX county, XX province. Once, the county party department published his embezzlement, and he was furious, killing three party committee members. As a result, he was stripped of his powers by the government again.</p>
<p>There were many opportunities this year. XX still looked upon him埀靑and called him to Hankou to wait. Before leaving, he told his concubines:</p>
<p>"I have been unlucky for two years. The mansion in XX city and the land in XX county have all been sold. Your expenses are really too high. How many months can the little bit of money saved in the bank last? Before I assume a new position, your expenses must also be slightly reduced. You don't have to worry about food and clothing. Each of you will receive fifty yuan of pocket money per month, which will be distributed by the First Wife. Listen up!"</p>
<p>Last month, the commander wired the First Wife to go to Hankou. It could be guessed that there was a seventy to eighty percent chance of a new position. As a result, the concubines all beamed with joy, and the Second Concubine even suggested having a lively mahjong game to celebrate the First Wife's departure. Moreover, the Sixth Concubine, who had been rejected by the commander, also asked someone to come to the door to seek forgiveness again.</p>
<p>The First Wife had been gone for more than a month with no news, which was enough to make the concubines feel disappointed to the eleventh degree. What's more, the commander suddenly sent back a servant, saying that the concubines should pawn their gold jewelry to raise one thousand yuan to run sports, which made the concubines feel the coming of misfortune.</p>
<h3>The Silk Padded Jacket</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Zhang Da Ma watched her son go to the factory with his hands in his sleeves and his shoulders shrugged. Thinking about herself sitting at home eating, but wearing a thin padded jacket, "Although Afu is my son, can I watch my son suffer from the cold?" Besides, he is in his twenties and knows that the family is poor. He has never spent the money he earned on women like Li's Xiao Ding. Originally, the Zhang family was also a well-off family, but it was all spent by his father. Thanks to Afu's filial piety, otherwise, my old life would be difficult to live. Zhang Da Ma thought of this and couldn't help but shed tears; while her son's cotton robe was locked in the pawnshop, and it would take four yuan to redeem it. Facing this difficult problem, Zhang Da Ma sat by the box in a daze.</p>
<p>Finally, she mustered the courage to turn over that box. She knew very well that there were only a few worthless rags inside, but life is always filled with endless hope│she hoped that she might accidentally discover a piece of clothing that was slightly valuable. Broken and old, they were simply unrecognizable as to whether they were tops or pants, filling the ground. Zhang Da Ma excitedly pulled a brand-new silk padded jacket from the bottom of the box, as if she was going crazy. It was made a month before Zhang Da Ye died. Zhang Da Ma was saddened by seeing this padded jacket, so she casually stuffed it there. Now, it had given her great hope.</p>
<p>"This padded jacket must have cost twenty-odd dollars when it was made, and it has only been worn once. It should be enough to pawn for a cotton robe for my son, or maybe even two dollars more to buy a catty of jujubes for my son to nourish him," Zhang Da Ma thought as she walked, carefully folding the padded jacket in a broken package.</p>
<p>She looked around like a thief. Seeing no pedestrians on the road, she quickly turned into the screen of the pawnshop. She lifted her head and handed up the package. The clerk casually flipped through it. "How much?" The voice always sounded like a judge questioning a criminal because they most disliked old and out-of-date clothes.</p>
<p>"Sir, five... yuan... please..." Zhang Da Ma was afraid of being scolded by the clerk if she asked for too much and unwilling to give up the silk padded jacket that had only been worn once if she asked for too little.</p>
<p>"Bah!" If Zhang Da Ma hadn't snatched it back quickly, the package would have been thrown on the ground.</p>
<p>"Sir, how about this?" Zhang Da Ma tremblingly took out the pawn ticket for the cotton robe and sent the padded jacket up at the same time. "Exchange them, sir."</p>
<p>The clerk saw clearly that the amount on the pawn ticket was three yuan and four jiao. "No, no!" He pushed the things on the high counter down again.</p>
<p>"Sir, that padded jacket is made of silk!"</p>
<p>"Don't want it!" He was clearly angry that she didn't know her stuff.</p>
<p>"Sir, how much is it worth?"</p>
<p>"One yuan and two jiao!"</p>
<p>"Sir, three yuan, please." Zhang Da Ma thought, "I still have a few mao of silver in my pocket, which should be enough to redeem the cotton robe."</p>
<p>The clerk didn't seem to have that much time and didn't pay any attention to her.</p>
<p>On the way home, Zhang Da Ma thought, "A poor man's silk padded jacket is so worthless!"</p>

<h3>Sympathizer (Part 5)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>His mother said: Isn't this as precious as gold? Now it's the hungry months in the countryside. Rice only sells for four yuan a dan. Eight yuan is two dan of rice? How can that be? Can we still afford to study! Meng Guobin was very unhappy when he heard his mother say this, and went into his room in anger. After entering the room, sure enough, the oil lamp was lit on the table, the teapot was cool, and a wisp of green smoke was rising upward in swirls under the table. By the table was a green bamboo chair, upright and clean, without a speck of dust. He thought to himself, "My family has treated me quite well. I often think that my family is a petty bourgeoisie. But if my family were not petty bourgeoisie, where would I get the money to study? I wouldn't even know what petty bourgeoisie is. However, people like my father are always stubborn in their thinking. I said that Wang Lao Er is an oppressed person, but he doesn't think so. He thinks it's good that he picked more than two dan of other people's crops and got half of the rice to eat. He doesn't think that that half is given to the absentee landlord, which is very unfair. My father's behavior can represent the opinions of small landlords, which is worth noting. Tomorrow, I can talk to Wang Lao Er and see what they think about the landlords." Thinking like this, he took out his sixteen-yuan fountain pen from his pocket, and also took out a diary, and wrote a line on it, saying: The landlord thinks that the land he bought with his assets is given to the tenants to cultivate, and the tenants should share half of the produce. As for the fact that he has not contributed the slightest effort to the cultivation, he does not ask. After this passage, he listed several questions in his diary, preparing to use them as materials for talking with Wang Lao Er tomorrow. He had been home for three days, and the work of investigating the rural economy should also begin. After formulating the questions, he flipped through several social science books he had brought back, making a theoretical reference, and then went to bed. Because he had used his brain too much, his nerves reacted, and when he went to bed, he dreamed of going to Wang Lao Er's house. Wang Er's wife brewed tea, fried melon seeds, and treated him with extra hospitality. The harvest he gained in his dream was actually much richer than when he was awake. The next day, when he woke up and looked at his watch, it was nine o'clock. But his family had already eaten breakfast. His eldest and second brothers had gone to the fields to watch people tread waterwheels, his eldest and second sisters-in-law were spinning麻in their respective rooms, his mother had taken two nieces to the vegetable garden to pick vegetables, and two nephews had gone to the village school to study. When the sun was high in the sky, the family was quiet. He got another feeling, thinking that although his family was a petty bourgeoisie, they were not a leisure class. There were probably very few leisure classes in the countryside. As he was thinking this, he didn't know how he had alarmed his family. So his eldest sister-in-law served tea and water, his second sister-in-law fried rice for him to eat, and his mother also got the news and took out two eggs from the藤簸籮basket on the bottom layer of the wardrobe and fried them for him as a dish. Meng Guobao certainly knew that his family was very hospitable to him, but this kind of hospitality was a bit excessive, and he felt that it made him feel uncomfortable. He ate his meal hastily, and looked at the sun, which was not far from the middle of the sky. This was what the country people called mid-morning, which was more reliable than a clock, so Meng Guobin didn't bother to look at his watch, but only looked at the shadow of the sun. At this time, it was time for his appointment with Wang Lao Er, so he straightened his clothes, smoothed his hair with his hand, and went to Wang Lao Er's house. Wang Lao Er口旱烟袋was watching at the gate. Seeing Meng Guobao coming, he bowed and said, "Mr. Meng is here, please come inside and sit down." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Little History of a Star</p>
<h3>Little History of Gwili Andre</h3>
<p>— Xie Nan</p>
<p>While we are vigorously opposing films that insult our nation, gold-dollar producers continue to shoot films depicting our people's ugliness such as拖瓣子, selling opium, and kidnapping, and promoting them on the international stage. What is introduced here is the female lead in "Roar of the Dragon," a film with a background similar to these.</p>
<p>Before圭利安特丽Gwili Andre, no one in the silver screen knew her, but in her homeland, Sweden, because her father was a famous writer and art designer, no one in Copenhagen did not know him, and no one did not know that he had a very beautiful daughter. She had excellent talent, but she loved to dress up and didn't like to study, often sneaking out and not coming back, so many tutors were unwilling to teach her anymore.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, she was already well-known in the local social circles; but at that time, she was still alone because she held the tenet that "a free soul is considered free." Her parents also approved of her idea and finally let her come to the free land of America.</p>
<p>In a certain village in America, she had a relative who had a very beautiful villa, so she went to live there. Within twenty-four hours of her arrival, many unfamiliar men came to visit her, but most were politely rejected. She just diligently practiced網球 and swimming at home. But after all, her beauty and liveliness, and the environment in America that had been熏洗for a long time, would not allow a hero to be buried forever, so she became famous in society in less than half a year after arriving in America. The RKO company heard of her fame and invited her to the screen, which was the first voice in the main film world.</p>
<p>Later, relying on her talent and hard work, she gradually attracted attention in Hollywood. Before long, her free soul had been bound (?); because she already had a loving partner, who was a handsome and unmarried young man in the area. The two often danced and swam together.</p>
<p>In addition to liking music, she also had a hobby of collecting Chinese porcelain and antiques. Recently, she also loved collecting shells, often going to remote and isolated islands with people in boats, and bringing back a lot of shells. In short, everything about her was very mysterious and eccentric, and she was indeed a typical U (Unknown) type of woman in Hollywood. But we do not want this U-character girl and李却迪克斯to meet us in this "Roar of the Dragon."</p>
<p>Editor's note: After the film "Roar of the Dragon" was released in the United States, the public opinion was extremely unfavorable. The content was superficial and bad, and the performance was naive and tasteless. The Americans have already made a conclusion. It probably won't come to our country to show itself. Please rest assured, readers.</p>

<h3>Movies in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Xing Su</p>
<p>Taiwan, which was seized by Japan, is a place of beautiful mountains and rivers. It is divided into six prefectures: Keelung, Taipei, Tainan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hualien Port (which is Taitung). Now all prefectures have trains. Transportation is very convenient, and the market is gradually prospering. There are now more than twenty movie theaters operating, most of which were established by Japanese people, so most of the films shown are also Japanese productions. The layout of the movie theaters is completely Japanese-style, and the audience sits on the floor. The theaters employ specialists to read the description in the hall, but this custom is gradually being abolished. There are many overseas Chinese there, and they give a warm welcome to films produced by the motherland. According to statistics, since China has had its own films, more than two hundred kinds of films have been imported. The productions of the Mingxing and Tianyi companies are the most trusted. Other small organizations such as Youlian also import many of their productions. The productions of Lianhua Company do not seem to sell very well. The reason is that the folk customs in Taiwan are brave and there are fewer intellectuals, so they especially welcome martial arts films. There are four film vendors operating in Shanghai. The copyright fee for selling to Taiwan, calculated according to the two-year copyright period, is at least seven or eight hundred yuan for each silent film, and as much as one thousand two or three hundred yuan, depending on whether the film is popular with the audience there. It is a pity that the Chinese film industry does not seem to pay much attention to the copyright there. If the operation is improved, it would be an excellent market for promoting domestic films.</p>
<h3>Publication News of Yinguang Monthly</h3>
<p>The Yinguang Monthly, a publication of the United Film Company, is edited by Zhou Shoujuan and Zheng Shufang. All the pictures and texts are extremely refined.

Anyone who has a research interest in Western film art can contribute to the magazine. Whether it is original or translated, it is welcome. However, the style should be in vernacular with new punctuation marks. Once published, remuneration will be given accordingly. The address of the company is at the United Film Company, No. 384 North Suzhou Road, in this city.</p>
<p>Introduction to National Films</p>
<h3>"Two Orphan Girls of the Battlefield"</h3>
<p>"Two Orphan Girls of the Battlefield," which has been rumored in Shanghai for a long time, why is it silent again? People who care about domestic films must hope to know.</p>
<p>After it was filmed in September, it was once banned from public screening by the Central Film Inspection Association; later, after疏通, it finally received a passport. Unexpectedly, when it arrived in Shanghai, it was banned again by the authorities in the concession. Tianyi Company thought that since it could not be screened in the concession, and it was unwilling to screen it in small theaters outside the concession, the talk of the Shanghai premiere had to be shelved. But the Beijing-Suzhou area had already been shown!</p>
<p>The reporter went to Beijing last time and watched it at the Nanjing Grand Theater in the capital. So let's talk about it briefly.</p>
<p>The film is very long and the plot is very complicated: the general idea is: because of the Shanghai war, there was a weak girl whose family was destroyed. Her father died to save another girl. The two girls were separated before they could even ask each other's names. The rescued girl lived in her cousin's house and got engaged to her cousin. Good things are hard to come by. Her cousin fell in love with a female teacher. So she tried her best to make her cousin break off his love. Later, her cousin joined the army and met a nurse, who was actually an old lover (the female teacher). She also saw that the female teacher was the orphan girl whose father sacrificed for her; so she护gave her fiancé││cousin│　to her rival in love││benefactor││. She joined the women's battle team herself; but her rival in love was also unwilling to be the victor in a love triangle, so she continued to work as a frontline nurse.</p>
<p>The film introduces a newly successful male and female actor, Lu Lixia, who is also very competent, and the protagonist, Hu Shan, is the most moving. In Nanjing, many people criticized and said: She is even better than her sister││Hu Die││. I hope that in the near future, people in Shanghai will also be able to see this film. I think it is better than Tianyi's representative work "The Footprints in the Orchid Valley".</p>
<h3>Grand Pig Welcome Party</h3>

It is said that when this pig猡玀was escorted to Hollywood, the Shenxiong斯company held a grand welcome party for it.</p>

<h3>What Do Female Stars Do After Leaving the Studio? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xing Su</p>
<p>Chen Yumei is a female star who advocates frugality. She rarely walks around in social circles. In addition to filming, she is busy with household affairs. She does not have any children yet. She is the representative star of Tianyi Company. Hu Die is the representative star of Mingxing Company. The lives of these two representative stars of the two companies are very different. Although Hu Die is now much more frugal, she is still a single girl. She loves to walk around in dance halls and socialize, or learn to sing Ping opera in the Mingxing Opera Troupe.</p>
<p>Many male stars go to play in the回力球场stadium, and one of the female stars who often goes is Yan Yuexian. Of course, she also goes to dance halls sometimes. She has many girlfriends. When she is not filming, she is rarely at home. Zhu Qiuhen is different from her. She doesn't go out much at home.</p>
<p>Talking Ying, who is talkative and a bit childish, just loves to play. Recently, she has been busy with her "refusal to marry" case appeal. Wang Renmei and Li Lili, these two energetic and healthy girls, seem to love to watch sports and also love to use association reports for entertainment. They have many boyfriends, but their liveliness and romance are different from those of Hu Die, Talking Ying and other stars.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also female stars who like to吐雲吐霧puff clouds and spit fog on the smoke bed. This is really hateful, regrettable, and terrible, and will make them easily become粉骷髏red skeletons (The End)</p>

<h3>The "Smile" That Everyone Can Do</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>From the first to the fifth formula of the unique facial expression learning method, we have already practiced five of the most basic facial expressions. Although these five expressions also have various changes, they are relatively easy to practice, because they are very simple, and people of all statuses perform them similarly.</p>
<p>Now we want to go further and talk about practicing more complex and varied expressions. The first is the "smile" that everyone can do.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no one who cannot smile. Even babies in their mother's arms can smile, so why is it necessary to practice? Little do people know that smiling is the most difficult expression to perform appropriately in the performing arts. Anyone with a little directing or acting experience knows this. When directing a scene of laughter, directors often encounter many difficulties. Because people of different statuses must produce different kinds of smiles. In daily life, we have light smiles, fake smiles, sneers, cold smiles, amusing smiles, flattering smiles, silly smiles, wild laughter, roaring laughter, and so on. When the director wants you to laugh out loud, you face the camera and give a forced smile, or when you are asked to perform a toothy smile, you can't help but burst into roaring laughter. Sometimes, you think you are smiling, but the shadow left on the film looks like you are crying. Such mistakes can often waste many feet of film and sacrifice the precious time of many colleagues. This is because you have not paid attention to your own smile at all times, and you have not practiced until you have sufficient confidence. The reason for this is that you usually despise this smile that everyone can do.</p>
