<h3 id="c1">對日外交之轉換期　又玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國聯調查團報告書於日本之侵佔東北三省也。雖未明言日本對東北軍</p>
<p>事行動爲侵略行動。但謂｛［九一八事變］。······不能視爲合法之自衛辦法。｝除此（第四章）及｛［滿洲國］之構成······厥爲日本軍隊之在塲及日本文武官吏之活動。······基此理由現在之（滿洲）政權不能認爲眞正及自然之獨立運動所產生｝（第六章）以外於我國實多貶詞。於日本之侵略實未敢干犯。且於經濟關係尤多袒護。不過在九十兩章所提之解决條件與建議。又乘機實現其利益均沾之主張。以故日本在［報告書］發表之初。軍部方面之表示。尤爲露骨。於直接否定［調查團對遠東問題認識不足］之外。竟有如下之意見提出。</p>
<p>（一）［完全抹煞報告書之第九第十兩章之結論。］</p>
<p>（二）［滿洲之獨立及承認其獨立爲解决滿洲問題之唯一方法。］</p>
<p>（三）［强調（宣傳）中國非完全之國家。］</p>
<p>（四）［中國排日分子之存在即爲日華紛爭之根源苟此事而不得解决</p>
<p>則聯盟一切手段均無效果。］</p>
<p>（五）［關東之軍事行動乃自衛手段之發動。］</p>
<p>（六）［李頓報告書於日本人個人日本國家及日本官憲殊屬故意混同</p>
<p>應澈底摘發幷澈底排除之。］</p>
<p>此種論調何等强硬。且也增兵製械。日夜不遑。而戰時之預算計劃。海軍之到處示威尤爲遍佈備戰空氣。苟僅觀其軍部之一面幾認爲即下動員令矣。然而曾幾何時。（十日之間）前日之緊張空氣。竟又突然鬆弛試觀其最近對調查團報告書之正式意見。</p>
<p>（一）［使國聯正視滿洲事變之所以發生及中國不統一狀態。］</p>
<p>（二）［强硬主張日本（九一八）軍事行動爲不得已之行動］</p>
<p>（三）［對報告書不採辯駁態度但取攻擊與防禦兩種方法］</p>
<p>（四）［鄭重懇切糾正報告書之認識不足。］</p>
<p>其間雖不免增加若干外交詞令而内容之更正亦復不少尤顯明者厥爲對九十兩章不復完全抹殺。換言之即於［利益均沾］表示相當讓步也然則日本軍閥旣目空一切矣。何能於旬日之問。驟變其强横態度乎蓋强隣相逼在日本固猛拚其國家存亡以圖一逞。而美國豈僅强硬表示［不承認以武力侵略獲得之領土。］且在加州建築巨大之飛行塲大西洋艦隊亦長留夏威夷暫不歸隊。虎視耽耽。大有引滿待發之勢。所缺者國際間之助力耳設英國而能助美者。則今日僅口頭表示［不承認主義］之美國必將更進一步圖有效方法之制止也。法國前與日本似曾有秘密諒解。今親見日本勢將獨占東北。所謂［門户開放機會均等］也者徒託口惠已耳且於封鎖蘇聯一事匪特不肯履行。竟又進而引蘇聯以自重德意志又復力圖推翻凡爾賽和約使法國在歐陸霸權根本動搖。於是法國乃不能不暫時結歡於英美一面維持國聯威信。一面强制日本加緊反俄同時更須均沾滿洲利益。彼日本者亦難抛棄國聯於不顧也。設使日本眞陷於國際的孤立者勢非用兵不可。設此時果對外用兵其内在之困難。必然加甚。一則產業衰退。雖受貨幣澎脹政策一時的刺激。究竟無補於實際。失業工人。日積月累。數逾五十萬。其能擔負十萬萬元日金之新稅乎。再則農村經濟恐慌。匪特未嘗因市面暫時繁榮而輕减。且米價低落。竟在實際生產費用二十一圓五十錢之下。農村負債依然無法償還。所謂［自力更生］尤須較長時日。况復東北三省又遭中國健兒之强烈反抗。彼日本軍閥雖盲目猛進。不顧國際形勢之日非。但亦須計及其國民力之疲敝。是以報告書發表之初。日本軍部即加以猛烈攻擊。旣而外察世界輿情。内觀自身實力。乃不能不以强硬語調表示可以緩和之意。　　當此時也。國際間旣略有轉變。縱非有眞實助我之誠意。苟能及時善用。未嘗不可挽回當前之頽勢。結聯英美及對蘇聯復交。均爲亡羊補牢之要圖。而</p>
<p>外交上有效工具。端在自身努力有爲。抵貨之舉。旣以顯示我國人團結一氣之决心。義勇軍更係民族反抗之表。徵縱未能恢復疆土。亦足以表示中國民族之不肯屈服也。我國民際此時會於創痛之餘。急應努力自救。同時更須注意國民外交。另闢更生之新途徑。</p>

<p>（十）　程天放</p>
<p>所以要改革大學敎育　我以爲第一要確定重質不重量的主張、以後國家不必再增設大學、地方成私人　求設立大學政府應該嚴格拒絕、不但新的大學不准設立、已有的大學還要大加整頓、近幾年來一方因爲大學最時髦的時期已過、一方因爲敎育部之取締私立大學、故大學的數目已較五六年前爲少、但是據最近的統計、全國還有國立大學十三所地方立大學九所、私立大學十七所、國立學院三所、地方立學院千所、私立學院十二所共計六十四所、這個數目、實在是只多少不、在這些大學中設備較完善、辦理較好、程度較高、將來可以希望加入世界著名大學之林的固然有、然而有幾個稱爲大學、實然帶點勉强、尤其應該矯正的、是在同一地方設上好幾個大學、大學裏面包含同樣的院、同樣的系、重規疊矩、人才經濟兩俱浪費我認爲政府應該下一個决心、同一地方重複的院系一律歸併、對於辦理較佳性質近於專門學校的大學、就不客氣的令牠改大學爲專門、對於那前途很有希望的大學、就應該積極扶助牠發展、</p>
<p>第二大學一定要充實内容提高程度、現有的大學設備、大都因陋就簡、勉强敷用已算幸事、完善兩字簡直談不到、然而大學决不是幾個學生、幾個敎授幾間敎室、就可以算數的、没有完備的圖書館、試騐室·工場·農場等等、就根本不能作高深的研究、所以政府對於國立大學、院系重複的可以歸併、認爲某院某系辦得毫無成績就可以裁撤但是那些比較有成績的院系、對於設備方面、就應該撥大宗欵項做有計劃的擴充、對於地方國立或私立大學、辦得不好的可以停、院系太多的可以裁併、但是比較有成績的就應該按年補助、如此内容一充實、敎授學生研究的時候自然格外感覺興趣、格外易有成績、入學試騐、學期試騐、學年試騐、畢業試騐、都應該絕端嚴格、大學生旣然重質不重量、那就入學時候自然寗缺毋濫、而入學以後程度太差不能達到國家作育人才的本意的、也只有隨時降級、或呌他退學、開於提高程度方面、有一點注意的、就是現在大學肄業年限太短、高中辦得旣不完善、凖備工作已差、大學又四年就畢業、無怪乎有許多大學畢業生、連基本智識却嫌缺乏了、我認爲大學的文·理·農·工·商·經濟·法律·等科、應該延長爲五年畢業、醫科應該延長爲六年畢業、或者有人疑惑畢業年限延長、一方面造就人才太緩一方面有些學生急於謀生、不能久持、其實一個人才本待長期的養護、不可以希望速成、速成的人才未必能應國家的需要、至於急於謀生的學生、那就根本應該入專門職業學校、而不應入大學了、</p>
<p>專門職業學校和大學、自然都非收學費不可、但是在這種學校當中、無論是國立或私立的國家都應該設許多獎學金額或貸金額、獎勵家境貧苦而成績優良的學生、使他能夠深造、庶幾貧家子弟可以得一個受高深敎育的機會、不致埋没了他的天才、</p>
<p>師範大學之所以應該脫離其他學科而獨立、其理由是和師範學校之所以脫離中學而獨立是一樣的、就是師範生對於對國家應該負一種特殊的責任、中級師範生負的是養成健全國民的責任、而師範大學生負的責任是養成良好的中學畢業生、預備將來由大學畢業做社會中堅份子、這種責任是何等的重大啊、我們對於一個師範大學生、决不僅希望他將來在中學所擔任的課程敎得好、而且希望他修學勵行、勇於負責、在一切方面可以做靑年的領導、要有如此的中學敎員、才能養成人格優良感情豐富、思想純正、能力堅强的中學生、有了這樣的中學生、將來入了大學、才可以成爲人才、才可以擔當國家的大事、師範大學生旣然負這種重大的責任、在校時自然應受特殊的訓練了、</p>

<p>孫麟方</p>
<p>第二天破曉的當兒、便聽得丁丁東東的彈琵琶</p>
<p>聲、並且距離很近、怪而視之原來我們的Paul正在撫弄他的網拍、大作其改造博士哩、</p>
<p>德光是極喜歡睡覺的人、常常是睡不夠的、於是他便很輕易的榮　着我們Team裏的一個Baby的頭銜比較起别人要六七年纔能夠得一個博士的話他眞是幸運兒啊、</p>
<p>因爲招待　約我們往謁中山陵、於是便全軍出發到了陵園參觀了一會、又到中央運動塲、再轉到　谷寺去靈谷寺外有一所木屋四壁是畫家梁鼎銘君所繪攻惠州圖已經開繪三年了、現在尙未竣工、倒是一件偉大的作品呵、</p>
<p>今天的秩序、本定實華同我、對京市名將余志忠趙敏恒雙打、邱江的單打、道章·兆佳·對飛海·寳華的雙打、臨時我因爲友人的約會、遲到一步、所以不能不請德光代理了德光昨天已經傷手、今天是勉强扶病出場、很覺得對他有十二分的抱歉的、</p>
<p>三組的結果如下、</p>
<p>林寳華梁德光（六丨三　六丨一）趙敏恒余志忠（林梁勝）　　邱飛海（六丨四　六丨一）江道章（邱勝）</p>
<p>邱飛海林寳華（六丨三　六丨一）江道章鄭兆佳（邱林勝）</p>
<p>今天的表演寳華飛海有口皆碑、不必去說他、最好的要算邱江的單打了　在這一場裏道章的打法簡直如同換了一人似的我看過道章多少次的比賽、差不多要算這一次是最好的了　攔網、長抽、正反手在在皆臻上乘　回球也突然的加快了不少、今天的對手要不是飛海的話、差不多眞要被他打的落花流水了、阿佳的打法近來越發的狡猾打出的球、常常使人不易捉摸、阿梁負傷應戰不免稍形吃力總之我們這二天的表演大致總還差强人意對於參觀人士、還留下不壞的印像</p>
<p>比賽完畢我們收拾好行裝、便去萬國俱樂部、赴黃紹雄陳公博兩先生的宴會　列席者都是一時知名之士席次林道揚君起立致詞我便代表答謝並報告一點世界網球界的情形、然後貢獻點對國内網球界的意見、約略可分爲三點、（一）不普及、（二）無人訓練、（三）熱心倡導者又心餘力絀因此、希望最好能有實力充足的人加以倡導、然後中國網球界的前途纔能有新的發展、當下黃紹雄陳公博、何應欽三先生便相繼起立演說、除贊助我的意見外、並願此後盡力倡導網球、及將來選派代表赴國外觀光、說完、於是便在四座如雷掌聲裏、開始大嚼了、</p>
<p>席散、因爲陳公博先生的提議、玩了一會乒乓球、然後纔送我們上了車站、</p>
<p>十一點鐘的當兒我們已經走上了歸途、憧憬的心影裏、祇留下了送行者一片的Don't　Forget聲浪、</p>
<p>回首燈火萬象愈距愈遠、兩日來小聚的白門、已在隱約之中、漸漸的消失了、</p>
<p>在車上大家都覺得十分的疲乏、便卽安息、不過車身動的太利害了再也睡不沈着、好容易等到天亮、纔聽說北站已經快到了］、</p>
<p>因爲連日勞頓、車上失眠、下車時大家都精神恍惚的連皮包全不想要了、</p>
<p>下了車、飛海忽然大嚷怪事、原來他拿在手裏的皮包不知在什麽時候不翼而飛、經過出了一身大汗之後、却在他的一個朋友的手中發現了總之、這次我們赴京表演、盡了一點國民的本分我們心裏很覺暢快、尤其是黃紹雄陳公博兩位先生、肯負起倡導網球的使命、和將來選派代表赴國外觀光的計劃、更是値得我們永遠不能忘記的、想黃陳兩先生、九鼎一言、一定可以早日實現、我們且拭目以待吧（二十一·十·十一）</p>

<p>— 量記</p>
<p>相老人說：蕩子回頭的故事，出處本路加福音，眞是一篇絕妙好文章！</p>
<p>但看這位老父親、見了蕩子回頭：何等興致！何等情致！</p>
<p>那一個年輕的蕩子，硬要分家：得了家私，浪用用光！祇好替人牧猪，連猪吃的東西都得不到，於是回心轉意過來說：丨</p>
<p>［我父家中，如許傭人，麵飯充足：我竟在此餓死麽？我起身去投奔我父親，對他說：丨爹爹呵！我得罪於天，得罪於你，我不配再呌你的兒子了，請當我算一個傭人罷！］</p>
<p>蕩子旣然這般回心過意了，便就起來一去實行了！正是喻罪人懺悔的情景丨這位白髮的父親，還離得遠哩：就動慈心，去迎接他！</p>
<p>隨後相老人講，本故事中，父親吩咐僕役替那回頭的兒子，穿着上好袍褂，再給他手上戒指，脚上鞋子：表示恢復［主］權的身份呢：也是按當時猶太風俗來說的。</p>
<p>因此提及那太約二十年前，相老人譯的一部聖經學名著：［新史合編直講。］相老人又追念他的老師告訴他的話，說道：</p>
<p>［這書編著者，是在獄中，憑記誦來編著，竟能如此熟讀了聖經，將］</p>
<p>四福音合編，連一個有用的［而］字（按即拉丁et）都没有省略了！這位呌費郎弟，眞令人欽佩他！］</p>
<p>相老人又稱：要好好讀聖經，應學希伯來希臘丁等古文。</p>
<p>［備考］相老人譯新史合編直講二十卷，上海土山灣印書館，一九一三年印行。</p>
<h3 id="c179">槍口對錯了 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>丨勇於内戰的軍人快猛省吧丨</p>
<p>我在幼時，曾聽見過一個笑話，說道：村中有一個老學究，很負能文的名聲。恰巧村中有人死了一個岳母，便請這位老先生做篇祭文，豈知他翻遍了所有的法寳，丨做應酬文的書本丨却只有祭岳父的，没有祭岳母的，便一字不易的抄下來給這人拿去。過幾天，這人向先生說道：先生做的祭文，恐怕錯了！他勃然大怒的說道：這祭文可以對證古本，實在是一字不錯，别要是他家死錯了人吧！</p>
<p>現在我國軍人的槍口，正和這位老學究的文章一樣。不是做得不好，却是對錯了人咧！</p>
<p>誰說中國的軍人不勇？自己殺打起來，前仆後繼，視死如歸。</p>
<p>誰說我們的軍械窳敗？近幾次國内戰爭，飛機咧，大砲咧，亦應有盡有。祗可惜方向不凖確，槍口却對錯了！</p>
<p>一二八滬變起後，十九路軍的翁照垣將軍，曾和他的部下說道：强敵壓境，忍無可忍了！惟有拚死一戰，方能死裏求生。我們的大砲燬了，好用長槍，槍彈没了，好用刺刀，刺刀折了，用你的拳打脚踢。末了還有你的牙齒，可以咬敵人。這幾句話眞說得忠義奮發，可以泣鬼神，動天地。爲甚麽呢？因爲這是禦外侮的誓師詞呀！</p>
<p>每逢一回内戰起來，各個武人的通電中，總說道：雖存一卒一彈，誓必與之周旋。這兩句話雖亦勇敢激烈，可是我們人民聽了，總覺有些腦脹，因爲任你爭强稱雄，總是一家人呀！</p>
<p>民國成立以來，槍口對外的，過去方面，祗有滿洲里一戰，和閘北一役：方興的是白山黑水間的義軍。唉！可憐！慚愧！二十年來的大砲砰訇，槍聲劈拍，都是對内的呀！</p>

<p>丨蒙了遺產的毒丨</p>
<p>因着保守知友秘密，把這迷兒悶在肚裏，快一年了。我所知道的［</p>
<p>今木蘭，］丨王抗夫女士丨比［耘飱］君詳要細得多：爲明瞭王女士的已往情形，還得從伊家世說起。</p>
<p>王女士是浙籍，伊父親是美國哥倫比亞大學文學博士，歷任日本某大學敎授。王女士生長日本，曾畢業日本高等學校，故日文很有根基，不幸伊的父親死了。伊旣無兄弟，終鮮姊妹，伊母親也是一個美術家，視王女士好像掌珠。顧慮到整個資產，將平白地給予姪輩，心有不甘，在携孤返國之際，就囑王女士喬裝男兒，易名［抗夫，］魚目混珠，固非一朝一夕了。伊回國後，先入滬西某大學附中，殆今夏已戴了方帽子哩。　　王女士嫻靜寡言，不改伊處女面目，友輩往來，和藹可親，尤其得天獨厚的是有一副聰明腦子。自某大學附中而大學畢業，從未列第三名以下，且同時兼攻文理兩科，近更專攻德文，擬赴德求深造。伊之投身童子軍，志願担任英日德等文字譯述工作，不意派到交通處求深造。伊之投身童子軍，志願担任英日德等文字譯述工作，不意派到交通處工作，良非王女士素願：不過爲國效勞，也未遑他計。後即悄然返滬。因伊的秘密給同事發覺，竟以之爲要挾，遂含淚離去。</p>
<p>王女士擅文學，其作品散在小說月報及一般月刋上的很多，所著小說和譯品，在文學上頗有相當地位。署名［抗夫］［萬曼］［雪梨］等的，就是伊的作品。伊篤信耶敎，每餐必虔誠祈禱，星期日於慕爾堂之前，常有伊的芳踪。</p>
<p>這裏代爲聲明的：據我所知，王女士並未和任何人同居，丨戀人固有丨現方執敎於滬西某鎭某慈善機關，蓋因咯血體弱，不能即時出國云。</p>

<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>丨都市與鄉村生活素描丨</p>
<p>在夏天炎熱如燔的時候，早晨六點鐘起身，洗過了臉，胡亂吃了點心已是七點了。這時Ｓ市馬路上行人尙少，弄堂口粢飯攤，糰子攤，牛肉索粉攤，倒聚了許多人，狼吞虎咽拚命地裝到腹裏去，付了錢，怱怱地各趕工作去。</p>
<p>ＨＬ生進了寫字間，已經八點一刻了：同事們陸續地到來，ＬＨ生開始工作。因爲室小如竇，人氣薰蒸，揮汗如雨一般，完了一天工作，已是五點多了。洗澡，吃飯以後，又做了二三鐘頭的文字勞工，正想登床睡覺，那芳鄰的胡琴聲，簫笛聲，猜拳聲，打情駡俏聲，男子鎖緊着喉嚨，［知心客］［十送郎］［哭七七］，唱着非常熱閙，直閙到一點鐘光景，倒變做意大利催眠歌一般，催輾轉反側的ＬＨ生入眠了。</p>
<p>大約四點鐘光景，倒老爺推着轆轆的糞車，發出破竹般的喉嚨道：［倒馬桶！倒馬桶！］繼着隆隆地敲鐡門聲，倒老爺，全倒奶奶的狂喊聲，ＬＨ生驚醒了以後，便不入睡，天也現魚白色了，一骨落起了床，壁虱還蠕蠕地爬在腿上，癢得非常難熬，唉！ＬＨ生天天度着這種生活呢。</p>
<p>黃金舖地的秋天，農村裏的男女老幼，最爲快樂而勤勞。晨光熹微中，婦燒飯男刈稻，兒童堆草的堆草，曬榖的曬榖，老人打米的打米，擔柴的擔柴，没一個不喜溢眉宇來工作。斜陽漸入西山的時候，提筐的，擔榖的，負柴的，驅牛羊的，放鷄鴨的，一個個還到家裏去，酒醉飯飽以後，便入黑甜鄉去了。</p>
<p>ＬＨ生在中秋還鄉的那一天，隣家正忙着收穫：鄉人的隣誼，和Ｓ市人大不相同。那隣家老翁，興致很濃，在槿籬裏捉出鷄來殺了，煑熟新割上的米，　好自釀的酒，慇慇勤勤地來勸客，少陵詩道：［盤餐市遠無兼味，樽酒家貧只舊醅。］鄉村天趣盎然，都市那裏及得來？所以ＬＨ生吃了隣翁的酒，便酣然入睡，没有賞那夜的月色了。</p>
<p>[P入關郵侶（十六）</p>

<p>還有魯大年的英文夜館，在這危疑震撼的時期中，一般知識階級中人，最招日本人的仇視，逃的逃的，死的死了，不特佟一貞不再來上課其餘同學們也都是裹足不前，杳無踪影，等於門雖設而常關了。到了冬令，魯大年凛遵古聖人危邦勿居的訓誡，又因所担任敎席的學校也同時關閉，徒留在這裏不僅生命危險，而生活亦無法支持，便抱定個遷地爲良的宗旨，將這家庭敎館草草結束，挈眷也向關内地方逃走。臨行，曾對伯勤那麽說過：</p>
<p>[弟弟不如也跟我走吧？我有個朋友在北平辦學，已寫信來替我謀妥了一個敎席，你去到後，或也可托他在學校裏另找個小職員做。這裏郵政局的事情雖原本不錯，似乎不應隨便抛棄；但據我觀測，日本人的辣手，總不能輕放過這郵權的，不久必有一番變動，恐怕你那小位置也難於保存。而且你一個人蹲在這裏也太危險，我很不放心，能走，還是早走的好。]</p>
<p>但魯伯勤那裏說肯走。最大的原因，是不能在這危難的時期，抛撇的愛人而去，只顧圖一已的安全。還有第二個理由，便是應該忠於職務，郵局中同事誰都没走，怎好自己那麽畏葸。不過那頭一個最大的理由，不好意思說出，僅盡量發表了第二個理由。</p>
<p>說到臨了，還補充了些最激昂的句子道：[中華民國國家正式的機關，在此地還勉强能行使職權的，郵政局是僅存的碩果了！局中同事，莫不同心恊力，生死以亡，要十分堅决的撑持這個殘局，以表現我中華民族愛國奉公不屈服於强梁的大無畏的眞精神，不盡完最後一絲的力量是誰也不能臨陣脫逃的。我一個人能那樣卑劣，以貽全國家全民族及全郵局同事之羞嗎？兄長！你請走罷，我是决心把一身全獻給於郵局我那寄命的神聖職務上了！你也無庸爲我策畫萬全了罷！]</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>在最近期間，我親友中靑年的自殺者凡三，一姓雷，一姓蔡，一姓黃，三人自殺原因，不用說，是婚姻和經濟兩問題的作祟，我的親友並不多，然而數日之間，竟然發見三人，則每日社會上靑年自殺的數量，當亦不問可知，惟此種萬惡慘酷的情狀，天然大部分當歸咎［色情狂］與［生活慾］極度澎脹所驅迫，　　靑年不幸生此混亂，複雜，枯竭，的社會狀態中，一切生活的需要，决不能靠政府和社會來解决，也不能靠家庭和父兄來解决，一切的一切，必須靑年自己去奮鬬和解决，而在靑年時期，其難關最不容易打破的，便是［色情狂］三字，但［色情狂］和［生活慾］，的確有密切連鎖的關係，因爲美滿的家庭，須要美滿的經濟來維持，易言之，若無美滿的經濟，則家庭間非但得不到幸福與快樂，而反欲增加痛苦，因爲［色情狂］則物質上必增加不需要的需要，精神上感受不必剌激的剌激，因此精神和經濟，多感着嚴酷而緊迫的慘痛，</p>
<p>［男子是泥做的，女子是水做的］，這句話祇有［色情狂］的賈寳玉說得出，其實易地以觀，或者也要說，［男子是水做的，女子是泥做的］，大約性慾的衡動，男女恐不甚相遠罷，但是愛情的爲物，大抵是流動的而非固定的，在某種時期之下，或者欲由熱烈而變爲冷淡，由冷淡而變爲憎惡，試看謀殺親夫呀！抛棄髮妻呀！捲欵潛逃呀！報紙上每天不知要佔幾許篇幅，幾位大律師，弄得舌敝唇焦，脚不貼地，這種事態，一方面固足以證明美滿的家庭，須要美滿的經濟來維持，另一方面，的確可以看出愛情的爲物，决不是固定的東西，［家主婆别人家的好］，我恐家主公也未必不如此，</p>
<p>他們倆在愛情白熱度衝動的時期，［海誓山盟，對天立誓］，［生則同衾，死則同穴］，他們看見小說中不少風流佳話，多少肉麻，現在請去問問幾位離婚案中雙方當事者，起初那一個不是受着過這樣愛河的洗禮，而今竟何如，故現在的靑年們，對於這一點上，須要認得明白，看得淸楚，自然會省却許多煩</p>
<p>惱，許多沈悶，不是我老頭子有了黃臉老太婆，才說這樣的風凉話，我在念四歲的時候，父親（時母親已見背）因爲責任上的關係，（從前所謂責任，現在不是責任），定要替我結婚，我極力地反對，我所反對的理由，天然就是個人生活尙不能維持，如何能維持家庭生活，結果，因爲當時的環境關係，畢竟屈服，成就了我倆的眷屬，就自此以後，牛衣對泣，鄰家飯香，受盡人間生活壓迫的痛苦，一點得不到身心上的安慰和快樂，此種情形，至今思之，還是不寒而慄，</p>
<p>從前有句話，［有妻萬事足，無債一身輕］，現在我要掉過頭來說，［無妻萬事足，有債不須憂］，因爲個人生活，無論如何，總容易維持，若有家庭，則阿大阿二阿三阿四，傾筐倒篋而出，那眞不容易維持呢，我曾聽見過這樣的一段笑話，</p>
<p>有某惡棍死了，去見閻王，閻王大怒，欲判他投隻猪玀，判官在傍說道，未免太輕，不如去判他做個秀才，閻王詫異道，這種惡棍，還値得判他做秀才麽？秀才和猪玀二者，罪名孰輕孰重，判官道，不是這樣說，猪玀平日非常享福，及死也不過一刀了之，若判他做秀才，並罰他生育七八個子女，那是受累無窮呢，</p>
<p>這話雖是不經，然頗有道理，現在平民生計問題，閙遍了世界，故東西各國，把婚姻問題，總放在腦後，先從生活上去掙扎，大約非等到古人所謂［三十曰壯有室］的時期，决不結婚，若是共產主義者，把愛情尤爲輕視，朋友即夫妻，夫妻即朋友，尤其是例外，大約做秀才，總是可怕罷，好在現在時期，婚姻問題，本有多種方式，</p>
<p>一自由結婚，</p>
<p>一不自由結婚，</p>
<p>一自由而不結婚，</p>
<p>一不自由亦不結婚，</p>
<p>現在婚姻的條件，本來不像從前的嚴酷，很有許多路逕可尋，儘視雙方的能力和性情而定其計劃，若把如花初胎的靑年，完全犧性愛河的浪濤裏，眞是毫不値得，諸靑年眞有犧牲的精神乎，則在現在時期，値得犧牲的地方，處處可以找到，若欲爲國犧牲，則去當兵，當義勇軍，可以前去爲國殺敵，値得，欲爲個人犧牲乎，則書房裏，實騐室裏，儘可於智識上殺出一條血路，値得，若欲爲社會犧牲，則社會中事業正多，只要你腦筋淸楚，事理明白，儘有你去犧牲的餘地，不過愛情之間，决不是你們靑年犧牲之地，</p>

<h3 id="c205">怎樣裝置喞筒　可權 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>平常起水的方法，不是用水車車水，就是用木桶汲引。但這兩種器械，都不能汲起低處的水。我們要想汲起低處的水，就必得要裝置喞筒。因爲喞筒不但是能汲起低處的水，而且比木桶，水車都要便利些喲。</p>
<p>喞筒分爲［吸上喞筒］和［壓上喞筒］兩種：</p>
<p>（一）吸上喞筒的裝法　就是用個圓筒，在筒中安個活塞，連根長柄，伸出筒外。筒下安根長管，呌做吸水管。換句</p>
<p>話說，就是進水的路徑。筒的上側，安根彎管，呌做噴水管。換句話說，就是出水的路徑。吸水管和筒相接的地方，以及活塞的中間，都安個向上開的活瓣，這樣預備好後，便將吸水管揷入水内，然後拿活塞的柄，向上提起，筒内的空氣就稀薄，壓力就减小，那活塞上面的活瓣就關閉，吸水管外面的水，受着外面空氣的壓力，由吸水管上升，推開活瓣，進入筒内。若再壓下活塞，吸水管上面的活瓣就關閉，筒内的水不能從吸水管流出，就推開活塞上面的活瓣，褲　的變化</p>
<p>升到活塞上，等活塞再提上的時候，活塞上的活瓣又關閉，筒内的水，就跟着活塞上升，從噴水管噴出。同時吸水管外面的水，又從吸水管上升，推開活瓣，升入筒内。如此活塞上下移動，吸水管外面的水，總是陸續的由噴水管噴出，所以呌做［吸上喞筒。</p>
<p>（二）壓上喞筒的裝法　也是用個圓筒，吸水管和吸水管上的活瓣，都是和吸上喞筒相同。不過射水管，要安在圓筒下部的傍邊，射水管中，安個向外開的活瓣。活塞中間不另安活瓣。活塞提起時，筒内的空氣就稀薄，壓力就減小，那噴水管和筒相近處的活瓣就關閉，吸水管的外面的水，受着外面大氣的壓力，由吸水管上升，推開活瓣，升入筒内。若再壓下活塞，吸水管上面的活瓣就關閉，筒内的水，不能從吸水管流出，就推開噴水管和筒相近處的活瓣，從噴水管噴出，同［吸上喞筒］是相反的所以呌做（壓上唧筒）。</p>

<h3 id="c207">廢除冥器冥物之我見 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>鬼，究竟是有呢還是没有，現在歐美各國的科學，雖是日見昌明，但有鬼無鬼却還没有正確的證明，就把人們在睡眠的時候　知覺完全消失說來，那睡和死，没有多大的分别，可證人死而後，無所謂鬼，比較點還是近情些，但現在多數的人們，却以爲是有鬼的，家裏有了病人，便去求神同卜，祭祀鬼神，至於死了一個人，那錫箔，冥器，冥物，尤其是不可缺少的東西，不拘人家的大小，總要燒化不少。</p>
<p>就我們鄕下說來，富有的人家，一年之中，祭祀所需的錫箔，要化去幾十元至幾百元，就是普通的人家，也需十元左右，而最貧困的人家，也非一二元不可。所以每年爲了祭祀而所需的錫箔，眞是不堪計數，每年要無謂的耗費無數金錢，豈非可惜，至於家裏死了一個人那冥器，冥物，以至錫箔，所費的更是不資呢！</p>
<p>鬼的有無，我們尚且還不敢確說，那這些東西燒下去是否有用，更是渺茫了，我們退一步講，作算是有鬼的，這些東西，旣燒做了灰，又有什麽用處？而且如果眞的有鬼，我們可以確切的斷定鬼也和人一樣，能夠製造東西，發明器物，也用不到人去供給，正和人一樣，生下來除了身體之外，不帶什麽東西，一切的一切，都須自已去制造，從這方面着想，冥器，冥物，和錫箔的無所用處，更是可想而見了。</p>
<p>總之，中國人的迷信程度，委實是太深了，因爲迷信程度太深了，自有一</p>
<p>般的人利用了這種迷信心理，把各種冥器冥物，陸續的製造出來，自欺欺人。尤其使不値一笑的，最近又有鬼鈔票的印行，而自有一般　人去買來燒化，試問一張紙，印幾個字，鬼拿去就可當鈔票用麽？冥國銀行，冥豐銀行，開在那裏？是人開的還是鬼開的，鬼拿去是否可以兌現？</p>
<p>委實是太無謂了吧？家裏死了一個人，要替他做紙衣服，紙器具，這些東西，燒化了是否可穿？是否可用？還要把紙上的薄錫，當做了鬼用的銀兩，說來中國人未免是太滑稽而太無謂了吧？然而把全中國統計起來，所有冥物，冥器，和錫箔，每年所耗費的金錢，怕是無法估計呢！</p>
<p>眼前中國人的經濟情狀是如何？是否在萬分的恐慌之中？但却有這麽多的錢化在鬼的身上，而絲毫不見有吝惜，</p>
<p>如此的慷慨怎能令人不佩服呢？不果這種金錢，是化費得太無謂了，太没用了，中國的事情，留待着我們去建設的正多，倘能把這筆有用的金錢，做一種實際的工作，那不是有利於邦國和民衆嗎？總之，中國處在如此危險的境地之中，經濟情狀，又如此，一切無謂的消費，自當一概廢除呢！</p>
<p>要想廢除冥器，冥物，這工作就要我們一般靑年去負起來，到各地去宣傳無鬼之說，即或退一步，也應堅說冥器，冥物的無謂和無用，而同時，還要希望政府方面，能夠禁止冥器店的開設，雙方同時進行，才能打破民衆的迷信心理，而節省無謂的消費，不過民衆的迷信程度已根深蒂固，非得要我們去努力工作不可！</p>

<p>愛華走到家裏，喊着爸爸：我來了，媽媽呢｜。爸爸啊育，愛華。你來了嗎，你的媽媽，買物事去了。愛華在爸爸旁邊的椅上，坐下來說？爸爸：我出了門後爸爸和媽媽</p>
<p>好嗎。</p>
<p>爸爸我好的，媽媽也好：愛華；你出嫁一日的晚上，我和你的媽媽，出了多少眼淚，你在家的時候，不時的呌，爸爸：媽媽；多麽愛惜你。多麽痛疼你？你畢了學，　　裏更覺得歡喜。有你出了嫁　　　　　　　　　凉　我　　是痛心，還憶念你。到了那邊，生生疎疎的，不知好不好？喂娘姨，去喊點心來。娘姨呢愛華爸爸，點心不要去喊，我吃不下呀。</p>
<p>爸爸愛華，你爲啥吃不下呢。愛華說着吃不下，胸裏湧上心事來了。嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來。爸爸愛華，你爲啥事體呀，對我講。到底啥事體，快告訴我呀啊！愛華：你的婆婆，不愛惜你。是嗎？愛華哭着道了不是···爸爸你的丈夫，與你不投情意，是嗎？愛華是呀他頭兩天，到我處來走走，後來一脚兒没有來過，日夜到跳舞廳，和影戲院裏，還和着，（小花園）裏的一個妓女。不知呌啥，哦。鶯妹，片刻不分離的，說罷。哭得更加厲害了。爸爸聽了愛華的話，痛惜愛女，也出眼涙了。媽媽買好了物事轉來，一到家裏。見愛華嗚嗚咽咽的哭着，不覺驚奇起來！愛華！你爲啥哭呀！</p>
<p>愛華聽見媽媽問道，喊了一聲媽媽。重又哭個不住。</p>
<p>告給我媽媽聽，媽媽與你做主意。</p>
<p>愛華仍是哭着不說爸爸嘆了一口氣，把愛華的話，說了一篇。媽媽聽着。怒冲冲的道，唉老頭，老頭你不好，你不好呀我呌你慢慢的商量，我只有一個愛女，縱疼慣的。不聽我的話，你一專</p>
<p>主的，就答許了。現在弄到這般地步，呌我痛心不痛心嗎。爸爸唉現在木已成舟了，你不要怨三怨四的怨我，我已經比（吃○，還懊悔了，）似（啞子吃黃連）說勿出苦楚。你也不好，還是大家商量個什麽辦法呢，</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Transition Period of Diplomacy with Japan 　You Xuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Report regarding Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces, although not explicitly stating Japan's military actions in the Northeast as an act of aggression, stated that {"The [September 18th Incident]... cannot be regarded as a legitimate measure of self-defense."} Besides this (Chapter 4) and {"The formation of [Manchukuo]... is due to the presence of Japanese troops and the activities of Japanese civil and military officials... Based on this reason, the current (Manchurian) regime cannot be regarded as arising from a genuine and natural independent movement"} (Chapter 6), it contains many depreciatory remarks towards our country. It did not dare to offend Japan's aggression, and it especially favored it in economic relations. However, the conditions and suggestions for resolution mentioned in Chapters Nine and Ten also take the opportunity to realize its claims of equal benefit. Therefore, at the beginning of the publication of the [Report], the expression from the military aspect of Japan was especially blatant. In addition to directly denying that [the Investigation Team has insufficient understanding of the Far East issue], the following opinions were put forward:</p>
<p>(1) [Completely obliterating the conclusions of Chapters Nine and Ten of the report.]</p>
<p>(2) [The independence of Manchuria and the recognition of its independence are the only way to solve the Manchurian problem.]</p>
<p>(3) [Emphasizing (propagating) that China is not a complete country.]</p>
<p>(4) [The existence of anti-Japanese elements in China is the root cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute. If this matter cannot be resolved, all means of the League will be ineffective.]</p>
<p>(5) [The military actions in Kwantung were the initiation of self-defense measures.]</p>
<p>(6) [The Lytton Report deliberately confuses Japanese individuals, the Japanese state, and Japanese officials, and should be thoroughly exposed and thoroughly eliminated.]</p>
<p>How tough is this kind of argument. They are also increasing troops and manufacturing weapons day and night. The wartime budget plan and the navy's demonstrations everywhere are even more widespread, creating an atmosphere of war preparation. If one only looks at the military side, one would almost think that a mobilization order is about to be issued. However, how long has it been (ten days)? The tense atmosphere of the previous days has suddenly relaxed again. Look at its recent formal opinion on the Investigation Team report.</p>
<p>(1) [Make the League of Nations face squarely the cause of the Manchurian Incident and the state of China's disunity.]</p>
<p>(2) [Strongly argue that Japan's (September 18th) military action was an unavoidable action]</p>
<p>(3) [Do not adopt a rebuttal attitude towards the report, but adopt both attack and defense methods]</p>
<p>(4) [Sincerely and earnestly correct the report's lack of understanding.]</p>
<p>Although some diplomatic rhetoric is inevitably added, the revision of the content is also quite considerable. What is particularly obvious is that it no longer completely obliterates Chapters Nine and Ten. In other words, it indicates a considerable concession regarding [equal benefit]. So, the Japanese warlords already look down on everything. How can they suddenly change their tough attitude in ten days? It is because with a strong neighbor forcing them, Japan is indeed desperately fighting for the survival of its country to achieve its goals. However, does the United States only express strongly [non-recognition of territories acquired by military aggression]? Moreover, it is building a huge flying field in California, and the Atlantic fleet is also staying in Hawaii for a long time without returning to its team, watching intently, with a great posture of being ready to launch at any moment. What is lacking is the assistance of the international community. If Britain can help the United States, then today, the United States, which only verbally expresses the [non-recognition doctrine], will definitely take further steps to find effective ways to stop it. France seemed to have a secret understanding with Japan before. Now that it personally sees that Japan is about to monopolize the Northeast, the so-called [open door and equal opportunity] is just empty talk. Moreover, it not only refuses to implement the blockade of the Soviet Union, but also goes a step further to use the Soviet Union to build itself up. Germany is also trying to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles, fundamentally shaking France's hegemony in Europe. Therefore, France cannot but temporarily reconcile with Britain and the United States, on the one hand, to maintain the credibility of the League of Nations, on the other hand, to force Japan to intensify its anti-Russian stance, and at the same time, it must also share the benefits of Manchuria. Japan is also difficult to abandon the League of Nations. If Japan is truly trapped in international isolation, it must resort to military force. If it uses military force externally at this time, its internal difficulties will inevitably be aggravated. First, the industry is declining. Although it is temporarily stimulated by the monetary expansion policy, it is ultimately of no help to the actual situation. The number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day, exceeding 500,000. Can they bear the new tax of 100 million yen per day? Secondly, the rural economy is in a panic. Not only has it not been alleviated by the temporary prosperity of the market, but the price of rice has fallen below the actual production cost of 21 yuan and 50 cents. Rural debts still cannot be repaid. The so-called [self-reliance] still requires a longer period of time. Moreover, the three northeastern provinces have also suffered strong resistance from Chinese heroes. Although the Japanese warlords are blindly advancing and ignoring the daily non-existence of the international situation, they must also consider the exhaustion of their national strength. Therefore, at the beginning of the publication of the report, the Japanese military immediately launched a fierce attack. After observing the world's public opinion and examining its own strength, it could not but express its willingness to ease the situation in a tough tone. At this time, the international situation has slightly changed. Even if there is no real sincerity to help us, if we can make good use of it in time, it is not impossible to reverse the current decline. Forming alliances with Britain and the United States and restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union are all important plans to mend the fold after losing the sheep. And</p>
<p>Effective diplomatic tools depend on one's own efforts. The anti-Japanese boycott has already shown the determination of our people to unite as one. The volunteer army is an expression of national resistance. Even if it fails to recover the territory, it is enough to show that the Chinese nation refuses to yield. At this time, after the pain, our people should urgently strive to save themselves. At the same time, we must also pay attention to national diplomacy and open up a new path to rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Shandong Affair Resolved Settlement Methods <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan orders Han and Liu to comply</p>
<p>Designating Laiyang and other counties as the defense zone for Liu's troops</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian returns political power to the Shandong Provincial Government</p>
<p>Han Fuqu's troops must withdraw west of Weixian</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shandong Han and Liu incident, based on the report of Military Council inspection commissioner Li Yuezhi and Jiang Bocheng's telegraphic consultation, a telegram has been sent to Han and Jiang to request instructions on how to handle it. A reply has been received, with the Military Department designating Laiyang, Muping, Yantai, and five other counties as the garrison area for Liu's division. All political power is to be returned to the Provincial Government. The defense area ceded by Liu's troops is to be guarded by local militias. As for Han Fuqu's troops, they must withdraw west of Weixian. At today's meeting of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin</p>
<p>After reporting the above methods, telegrams were sent to both Han and Liu, urging them to strictly comply. If they still dare to disobey, the Central Government will definitely adopt other effective methods to handle the matter. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian recently telegraphed his representative in Beijing, stating that Han is still outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant towards the ceasefire order. His troops have not returned to their original defense areas and have sent a cavalry brigade and approximately two thousand militiamen, disguised in civilian clothes, distributed in Zhaoyuan, Huangxian, Penglai, Fushan, and other counties, allowing them to requisition and extort. (18th dispatch) (Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative, Yang Lichuan, stated that he recently received a telegram from Han Dong, the chief of staff of the 21st Division in Wuhan, stating that Chairman Chiang is still strictly ordering both sides to withdraw their troops to their original defense areas before September 15th, regarding the Shandong affair, and is awaiting central government handling for the second step. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today at 6:40, Jiang Bocheng went to Beiping. All important figures saw him off at the station. It is heard that the provincial military will withdraw from Yantai and the Yantai-Weihsien road. The Central Government guarantees that the Liu army will hand over political power. The troops in Yexian will withdraw to the west of the Weihsien River. The troops in Laiyang will withdraw to Jiaoxian and Pingdu. Liu Xizhong accompanied Jiang to Beiping to meet Zhang and reported that the provincial military was complying with the order to withdraw. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng said that this morning, he instructed Han to discuss the method of resolving the Jiaodong incident with Han, according to the intentions of the Commander-in-Chief. Han agreed to withdraw his troops first and await the Central Government's disposal. He immediately ordered Chief of Staff Zhang Guoxuan to telegraph Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang of the Weixian headquarters, Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division in Yexian, and Rong Guangxing, commander of the 87th Brigade in Laiyang, to withdraw the provincial troops from Laiyang and Yexian back to their original defense areas, starting from the 20th. Minister He telegraphed this morning, saying, "Brother Xiang's willingness to compromise and yield is deeply admirable. Han has telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief, Minister He, Chief of Staff Zhu, President Song, Director Zhang of the Military Affairs Committee, stating that he is complying with the order to withdraw his troops and awaiting the Central Government's disposal. The Jiaodong affair has come to an end. I have telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief and Minister He and have scheduled to return to Beiping tonight." (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Fan Yuhuang returned to Nanjing this morning. According to him, he originally received a telegram from the Military Affairs Committee, ordering him to wait for orders in Jinan. This morning, he suddenly received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, ordering him to go to Wuhan to report the situation here. I will visit Minister He in Nanjing tomorrow morning and then take a flight to Wuhan to visit the Commander-in-Chief on the 20th. I will still have to return to Jinan within a few days. (18th dispatch)</p>

After Wang leaves the country, I will naturally be responsible for the duties of the Executive Yuan. There will be no changes in the various departments.

The heads of the various departments of the Executive Yuan will visit Shanghai to meet Wang within a few days, since Wang is about to leave the country, to discuss everything.

The departure date has not been determined, but the doctor hopes to leave early in order to recover quickly and return to work. The location for medical treatment is approximately Germany, but it has not been fully decided. The period of medical treatment depends on the progress of the treatment. The Central Government has given him a three-month leave. If he can recover within three months, he will return to the country. Otherwise, it will be extended slightly.

<p>Amidst Tense Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>Philippine Independence Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 17th: Today, individuals within the US State Department stated that rumors of Stimson intending to resign are purely speculative and have no possibility of becoming reality. In any case, there will be no changes in the cabinet before March 4th of next year. The resignation on March 4th is simply a routine procedure at the end of each presidential term.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Williamstown, 17th: Franz, the director of the diplomatic section of the Associated Press's Washington headquarters, stated in a speech at the Diplomacy Institute of William and Mary College that, from the Philippine perspective, the US Congress's discussion of the Philippine independence issue coinciding with the League of Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Manchurian issue is unfortunate. After the Senate convenes this winter, the discussion of the Philippine independence issue will be the top priority. According to his thorough inquiries of various senators and Filipinos regarding the Manchurian issue, he deeply feels that after the unsettled situation caused by the Manchurian conflict, senators will approach the Philippine independence issue more cautiously. Although more people supported independence last year, the situation has changed. Even if the Far East does not experience further disturbances, the independence case still seems passable, but it may not be possible to obtain complete independence. If the future trend in Geneva can restore the world's confidence in the League of Nations and various peace mechanisms, then creating an international status for the Philippines may not be impossible. The competition between Philippine products and American agricultural products is sufficient to help the Filipinos argue their case, leading more American senators to support granting the Filipinos complete independence after concluding neutrality pacts with major powers. However, if the current dispute in the Far East continues unresolved, then the most the Filipinos can hope for is the status of an autonomous territory, because if the Philippines remains an object of contention in the Far East in the future, American senators will not easily agree to its complete independence.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Japanese Militarists Control All Power in the Pseudo-Army <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>All Levels of Commanders are Japanese</p>
<p>China United News, Tokyo, 18th: The Japanese military plans to make the Manchukuo army independent and wants Japanese to replace commanders at all levels of the puppet army. However, it does not dare to express it openly, fearing that once its ambition is exposed, it will cause the hearts of the entire Manchurian army to waver. Therefore, it has ordered Japanese officers who are monitoring the battles in various armies to request the commanders of various rebel armies in their private capacities to hire young Japanese students who have retired from the army to join the rebel army to show genuine cooperation with the Japanese. All the puppets, in order to maintain their positions and flatter the Japanese, are following orders without question. It is heard that they have already recruited personnel from junior high schools in Wakamatsu City, Fukuoka Prefecture, to enlist in the army. The first batch of personnel has already reached more than twenty people.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Reopening of the British Parliament <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement Declared Void</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - Parliament reopened today after recess. When former Home Secretary Sir Herbert Samuel, who resigned recently due to dissatisfaction with the Ottawa Agreements, arrived, Liberal MPs cheered him. Dominions Secretary Thomas announced the abolition of the Anglo-Russian trade agreement. Subsequently, Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon, in response to a question from Liberal MP Mond, stated that the government had recently proposed convening a conference of the four major countries concerned to resolve the difficulties arising from Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference. The other three countries have accepted the British proposal, but the location of the meeting has not yet been agreed upon. Thomas explained the necessity of abolishing the Anglo-Russian trade agreement, stating that it was in fact due to the Ottawa Conference. The government recognizes the importance of maintaining the preferential treatment stipulated in the Ottawa Agreements and preventing any foreign government from taking actions that would impede this treatment. The Anglo-Russian trade agreement allows Russia to enjoy most-favored-nation status, which would make it difficult for the government to implement any prohibitions when necessary, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e72">British Prime Minister Expresses Support for the League of Nations <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Still Seeking to Break the Deadlock in Disarmament Externally</p>
<p>Hoping for the Realization of Economic Policies Internally</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald delivered a very important speech at a luncheon of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in London today. All cabinet members were present except for President of the Board of Trade Walter Runciman, who was absent due to other business. The Prime Minister stated that the main objective of British policy was not to restore armaments but to reduce them. The British government supports the League of Nations and adheres to its covenants, and sincerely hopes that the Geneva Disarmament Conference will make a real contribution to solving the existing difficult problems of establishing world peace. Germany is well aware of this British policy, knows that Britain is willing to treat Germany as an equal in the Disarmament Conference, and knows that Britain is eager to use this opportunity to establish greater trust between Germany and its neighbors. Since the German issue requires seeking general agreement, the British government must be aware of everything. Germany should attend the conference to prepare for this agreement and exchange views with all parties. Britain and Italy have agreed on how to break this deadlock, and France is finally willing to meet with Germany. It is regrettable that although Germany claims to be prepared to participate, it is unwilling to go to Geneva. It is difficult to ascertain the reason. It is hoped that this is not the final word from the German government. The British government is still moving forward and hopes to have more to say in the coming days. If the British government's progress is not as rapid as some people expect, it is because the government understands that even proposals that appear very satisfactory on the surface have backgrounds that must be sorted out, otherwise disarmament cannot proceed. The British government must deal with the disputes behind the scenes, which is why its work cannot be as rapid as people expect. The British government may feel that it takes too long to perform the duties of a peacemaker, but the British government would rather be blamed for this than allow the situation to break down and make an agreement impossible, he said. The Prime Minister then spoke about the current government's domestic policies, stating that national efforts are still needed today, just as they were a year ago. He personally advocated maintaining the united efforts of all parties. The Prime Minister defended the government's economic policies, saying that hardships are inevitable in order to preserve the soundness of the national economic foundation. Fortunately, the major debt conversion plan has been successful, and its effectiveness has exceeded general expectations, he said. The Prime Minister concluded by stating that Parliament would reconvene on October 18, focusing on the events arising from the Ottawa Conference. Subsequently, the government will give the opposition an opportunity to criticize government policies as soon as possible, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Closing of the 13th League of Nations Assembly <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Kokumin) - The 13th session of the League of Nations Assembly held its closing ceremony today, with few attendees and a very cold atmosphere. The Greek representative, current President of the League of Nations Assembly, Politis, delivered a very lengthy closing speech, covering all issues, such as the disarmament issue and the Far East issue, but only stated that he hoped there would be a solution in the future. Politis then thanked Secretary-General Drummond and the other Secretaries from Germany, Italy, and Japan. Before the closing of the meeting, the Assembly passed a reorganization plan for the Secretariat and the budget, because although countries demanded austerity, the total amount of the budget was still over 33.42 million Swiss francs. After the closing of the 13th session, the Assembly and the Council convened another secret meeting, unanimously passing a resolution to appoint Avenol to succeed Drummond as Secretary-General of the League of Nations. This appointment still needs to be approved by the League of Nations Assembly in November and will not take effect until July 1 of next year. Avenol has been appointed as Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations since 1923 and has very senior qualifications in the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Reuters) - The current League of Nations Assembly held its final meeting today and passed a resolution requesting member states that are in arrears with their dues to find ways to pay their debts. Representatives debated the League of Nations budget for several days and finally cut expenses by a total of £12,000. However, the representatives spent five extra days in Geneva to handle this matter, and their maintenance costs were also £12,000, which exactly exhausted the amount cut. Assembly President Politis spoke about the criticism of the League of Nations by the world, stating that this criticism was either the result of ignorance or belonged to the political atmosphere. In fact, the League of Nations has created a diplomatic atmosphere conducive to negotiation. The Archbishop of Canterbury of England once said that the League of Nations, in any case, is the only pillar of international peace and unity. This statement is indeed not false, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e74">King's Interference in Administration Leads to Resignation of the Roumanian Cabinet <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Bucharest, 17th (Kokumin) - Roumanian King Carol has once again clashed with various political parties. The Vaida cabinet has resigned en masse because the King insisted that cabinet members cooperate harmoniously with Teodorescu, a close confidant of the royal family. The position of Foreign Minister was originally held concurrently by the Prime Minister, but the King recently appointed Teodorescu as Foreign Minister. However, due to disagreements with Vaida on foreign policy, the two were ultimately difficult to cooperate with. Since the King was unwilling to sacrifice Teodorescu, the cabinet resigned en masse. The Vaida cabinet was formed on August 11 of this year. At that time, political turmoil also arose due to the Roumanian King's interference in the cabinet, which ultimately led to the reorganization of parliament and the formation of the Vaida-Voevod cabinet. According to political party leaders, although the Roumanian King often compromises with the leaders of various parties, he continues to interfere in the cabinet, causing the execution of government affairs to be obstructed, he said.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 17th (Reuters) - The Roumanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister differed in opinion on the Russo-Roumanian non-aggression treaty, and the Roumanian cabinet resigned. The Roumanian King has accepted the cabinet's resignation but has instructed Prime Minister Vaida to remain in office pending the formation of a new cabinet. Politicians eager to obtain positions are reportedly besieging the palace, but many believe that a complete change will be detrimental to the political situation, as it is reported that the government is preparing to sign a non-aggression treaty and is preparing to accept the conditions proposed by the League of Nations for managing Roumanian finances.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Rumors of Gandhi's Stroke Unconfirmed <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>London, 17th (Kokumin) - The Daily Mail reported that Indian leader Gandhi suffered a stroke shortly after ending his hunger strike. However, the authorities are strictly maintaining secrecy to prevent news of his condition from spreading abroad. The newspaper obtained this information from a close friend of Gandhi, who currently resides in London. This person is not fully aware of the severity of Gandhi's illness or his current condition. In addition to this person, the newspaper was unable to verify the information from other sources.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Kokumin) - It is reported that the Labour Party intends to question the government about Gandhi's illness when the House of Commons meets this afternoon.</p>
<p>Poona, India, 18th (Havas) - Rumors that Gandhi suffered a stroke have been officially denied. It is reported that Gandhi met with Ambedkar, a representative of the Untouchable class, last night to discuss various issues, paying particular attention to the implementation of the Poona Pact negotiated during Gandhi's hunger strike.</p>
<h3 id="e76">German Restoration Movement <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Havas) - The issue of restoration is now being openly discussed in Germany. The restoration party is carrying out large-scale activities, and its plans are not concealed. The Nationalist Party openly stated the necessity of restoring the imperial system at election rallies. The Stahlhelm and its affiliated groups express their loyalty to the Hohenzollern imperial family and the royal families of the German states whenever they have the opportunity. In addition, the restoration party is conducting various public campaigns and resolute propaganda to agitate the people, so that the restoration proposal can be carried out smoothly. The power of this movement is present everywhere in Germany. Its leaders are very clever and do not directly conflict with forces opposed to the restoration, such as the Bavarian separatists. The leader of the restoration movement is the deposed Crown Prince, assisted by the Crown Princess. This group's plans have now made great progress, so Weimar cabinet member Meyer dares to openly say that Papen's visit to Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, as well as Papen's private relationship with the deposed Crown Prince, all prove that the restoration movement has made great progress. It is rumored in political circles that when Papen went to Munich, he seemed to vaguely say to the Bavarian government that the federal government would not oppose Bavaria restoring the monarchy at an appropriate time.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Heated US Election Campaign <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Automobile Tycoon Supports Hoover</p>
<p>Steel Tycoon Supports Roosevelt</p>
<p>New York, 17th (Reuters) - The US presidential election campaign is now intensifying. All parties will continue to lobby until election day. News from Detroit today stated that the Ford Motor Company issued a notice to its employees, workers, and agents across the country, urging them to vote for Hoover and do their best to support him so that Hoover can be re-elected. The notice stated that the interruption of Hoover's program would harm industry.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - Famous American steel tycoon Charles Schwab arrived in London today and told a Reuters reporter his views on the US presidential election. Schwab is a Republican but believes that American public opinion seems to be trending towards electing Democrat Roosevelt as president. Schwab pointed out that the Democratic presidential candidate is not prepared to completely cancel the war debts, but Schwab himself, speaking from the Republican standpoint, supports canceling the war debts as the best way to restore world prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Japanese Common People's Party Forms Assault Team <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Hua Lian) - Osaka branch leader of the Japanese Social Democratic Party, Kiyomi Tamawaki, is advocating the formation of an assault team, using the All Tenant Defense League as the basic organization. Fifty vanguard defense team members and 300 standby defense team members will be selected, including 50 female team members. The team members will mostly be selected from workers who are also veterans. A reserve system will also be established, and candidates must undergo three years of training. The purpose is to protect marches and demonstrations and the defense of the Common People's Party itself. Branch offices will be set up on each street, headed by a squad leader. The deployment of the assault team on each street must be requested from the headquarters through the squad leader, and the headquarters will be controlled by the Supreme Council. The chairman of the council has dictatorial power. Expenses will be borne by the person requesting the mobilization. Male and female team members enjoy equal rights. After this plan is approved by the National Labor Union Alliance Congress this fall, work will begin, it is said.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e80">Record of Investigation at Shanhaiguan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>He Zhuguo Cannot Resist Alone</p>
<p>Tang Yulin Actually Bans the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing Works Hard Regardless of Success or Failure</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army Urgently Needs Leather Clothing</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent days, news of the urgent situation in Rehe and the activity of the volunteer army outside the pass has been frequently reported. The truth is of concern to the world. I decided to go to Shanhaiguan to investigate to clarify the truth. I took the No. 101 train at 11:00 pm on the 13th. The first and second class passengers were as sparse as the morning stars. The third class car was overcrowded with hardworking compatriots with emaciated faces. At 7:30 am the next morning, the train passed Qinhuangdao. Looking out at the sea, there were four or five huge warships. At that time, only the reporter remained in the first and second class cars, and only a few dozen people remained in the third class car. At 8:00 am, I arrived at Shanhaiguan. The first thing that caught my eye was the Japanese flag and the puppet state flag at the station. Japanese garrison troops and police from the puppet Fengshan Railway were armed with guns and ammunition, glaring at us. I did not linger and left the station, taking a rickshaw to visit friends in the city and find a place to stay. After breakfast, I went out to investigate. However, the situation in Shanhaiguan was tense, and the local people were tight-lipped, advising each other not to talk about state affairs. Military and political authorities were also reluctant to speak freely due to their responsibilities. However, after a day of interviews, this trip was still worthwhile. I took the No. 102 train back west that evening at 10:00 pm and arrived in Tianjin this morning (15th) at 7:00 am. I will record the situation I obtained during this trip as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation at Shanhaiguan: Since the Japanese army occupied Jinzhou on November 2 of last year, the Beining Railway has been unable to leave the pass, and the Japanese army has frequently provoked incidents, causing panic among the people. Those with a little property have moved to Beiping and Tianjin, while refugees from outside the pass have flocked in, further exacerbating social unrest. The economy has been declining, and business has plummeted. Fortunately, Brigade Commander He Zhuguo of the 9th Brigade has maintained order, and the area has not fallen into enemy hands. In the past three months, He has worked hard to maintain peace by enduring humiliation, but some people do not understand and accuse He of being subservient and not practicing what he preaches. In fact, He's situation is extremely difficult. Under the command of a consistent policy of senior officials, it is difficult for him to resist Japan alone. On the night of the 1st of this month, several Japanese soldiers suddenly climbed the city wall, intending to plant the Japanese flag as a basis for the Japanese army to occupy the area. They were stopped by our sentries. The Japanese soldiers opened fire, killing one of our sentries. Our sentries also returned fire, killing one Japanese soldier. The entire Japanese garrison and puppet state police were mobilized. He Zhuguo tried his best to suppress the situation, not allowing them to return fire. The Japanese soldiers were noisy all night, without the opportunity to take advantage, so they returned to camp to rest. On the morning of the 2nd, a train of armored vehicles came from Jinzhou, demonstrating to us. After several negotiations, the Japanese side finally accepted the conditions of compensation and apology to settle the matter, and the death of our sentry was considered to be his fate. However, the amount of compensation paid by our side to the Japanese soldiers is not known because the military authorities are absolutely secretive. However, the Japanese soldiers provoke incidents no less than a dozen times a month. If we do not endure them, they will all be enough to cause major incidents. Such endurance is even more difficult than swallowing insults. He's troops have excellent discipline. Soldiers are not allowed to travel alone. During holidays, they are led out by squad leaders and platoon leaders. The number of Japanese and Korean ruffians is gradually increasing, all engaged in illegal activities, often mocking and insulting Chinese people. A curfew is imposed every night at 7:00 pm, and pedestrians are cut off at 8:00 pm. The current Shanhaiguan, from the surface, belongs to China, but in reality, it belongs to the Japanese army. If our country's authorities cannot recover the three northeastern provinces, then He Zhuguo is only temporarily guarding the pass for the Japanese army and will eventually lose it.</p>
<p>The Rehe Problem: Japan is still thinking of using political methods to acquire Rehe, not wanting to use force. Recently, because Su Bingwen and others have united to suppress the rebels, the Japanese army has paid great attention to it and is currently mobilizing troops. There will be a major battle soon. It is expected that the province of Rehe can be safe in a month or two. Reuters reported that Komai, a state official of the puppet state, will secretly go to Beiping and Tianjin recently to engage in activities, causing some people to suspect that Komai may be playing the same trick that Doiihara played in Tianjin last winter. However, according to those who are familiar with diplomacy, Komai is a personal follower of Honjo Shigeru. The divisions between Japanese military factions are very deep. With Honjo's departure, Komai has been squeezed out by the Muto faction. This visit to Beiping and Tianjin is only for inspection purposes and has no important tasks. What should be paid attention to now is the problem of Rehe's survival. If Rehe is lost, Shanhaiguan will inevitably be abandoned. At the same time, Hebei and Chahar provinces will be threatened, and the volunteer army outside the pass will also be in dire straits. If they do not die in the Japanese army's artillery fire, they will inevitably be trapped to death. Tang Yulin's mind is simple, his national concept is weak, the atmosphere in Rehe province is closed, and the people are ignorant and unaware. Although they hate Tang's exploitation, they do not dare to resist, and they are even more indifferent to the events in the three northeastern provinces. It is also heard that Tang strictly prohibits the National Salvation Army from operating in Rehe province and is colluding with the Japanese army. Therefore, the rear contact and transportation of the National Salvation Army have been greatly affected.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army in Liaoning Province: There are an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 people in the armed groups resisting Japan among the people outside the pass. Among those in Liaodong, Tang Juwu's troops have the most significant strength. They are currently in a difficult situation, without any assistance. Winter is approaching, how will they keep warm? It is truly worrisome. Those in western Liaoning are mostly under the command of Zhu Jiqing. However, the majority have not received military training and can only act with one burst of energy but cannot sustain it. Zhu, on the other hand, endures hardship and works hard, burying himself in his work and not caring about success or failure. He focuses on practicality and does not value propaganda. Zhu feels that most of the reports in the newspapers about the activities of the volunteer army outside the pass are untrue, which is inappropriate, saying that it is of no help and may even be harmful. And the traitors are especially hateful. Here is one example to prove it: Zhu secretly ordered the concentration of troops on the 6th to attack Yixian County. Unexpectedly, the secret was leaked by a traitor. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese army in Jinzhou dispatched troops to Yixian County, increasing security measures. There was one infantry artillery regiment, one company of cavalry infantry, and three aircraft. Brigade Commander Suzuki personally went to command. Our National Salvation Army troops, Meng Zhaoyan, Ma Zidan, and Li Haifeng, began fierce fighting with the Japanese army on the 10th, ambushing at night and moving during the day. They have been fighting for three nights. Both sides have suffered losses. According to information obtained by a train conductor of the puppet Fengshan Railway, on the 13th night, there was unrest in Yixian County by the volunteer army in plain clothes. The Japanese army retreated to defend the city. The National Salvation Army approached the city and fought a bloody battle until dawn. In the end, due to weak artillery fire, they failed to capture the county seat. The conductor also said that the railway line has been very peaceful since this month, and there have been no volunteer army activities. There are occasional encounters two or three miles away from the route. The autumn harvest outside the pass has been completed, and the plains are endless. The period for the volunteer army's activities has passed, and they have now entered a difficult period. In the past, the volunteer army needed guns and ammunition, but now they need leather clothing. It is hoped that patriots inside the pass and overseas Chinese will quickly find ways to raise funds, rush to make leather clothing, and hand them over to the volunteer army's rear office to be sent to the front so that they can continue to resist Japan in the snowy and icy weather.

<h3 id="e81">The Shandong Incident is Still Under Negotiation <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Korea Still Hopes that Liu's Army Will Leave Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The mediation of the Shandong Incident has made progress. Jiang Bocheng told visitors today that since Senator Li (Yue) and Staff Officer Fan (Yuhuang) went to Laizhou and Laiyang to inspect, both sides have stopped military action and are waiting for the central government to resolve the matter. After Senator Li returned to Nanjing, Chairman Jiang and Minister He have been sending telegrams for days, discussing the first step of each returning to their original defenses. Liu Zhennian will hand over administrative power, and neither side will station troops in the withdrawn areas, temporarily maintaining order with local militias and police. After Senator Li returned to Nanjing, Chairman Jiang and Minister He have been sending telegrams for days, discussing the first step of each returning to their original defenses. Liu Zhennian will hand over administrative power, and neither side will station troops in the withdrawn areas, temporarily maintaining order with local militias and police. Chairman Han is very open and frank and has repeatedly stated to me that he will obey all orders from the central government. Therefore, the 3rd Army of Han's troops can be allowed to withdraw according to the order, he said. However, according to Han Fuqu's statement to others, he does not yet know how the central government will resolve the Shandong Incident. If he is ordered to withdraw the 3rd Army west of the Weifang River, he will obey, but Liu's troops must be ordered to leave Shandong within a short period. Otherwise, after the 3rd Army withdraws, if Liu's troops delay leaving Shandong again, the people of Shandong will still be in dire straits, and he, out of responsibility, cannot ignore it. Therefore, the solution to this problem, on Han's side, still requires Liu's army to leave Shandong. (October 16)</p>

<p>Trial of Zheng Jicheng Case (Continued)</p>
<p>Q: You said in the prosecutor's office that you heard Zhang Zou and passersby hated him, so you intended to kill him. A: At that time, I didn't know he was leaving. I called the Shi residence, but no one answered. I guessed he was leaving because everyone from the Shi residence went to see him off, so no one answered the phone. The gun was originally in my house. When I went, Chen Fengshan was sitting in the front of the car as the driver. Chen usually carried a gun with me. That day, I first went to the Shi residence and saw the gate was half-closed, and no one was there. I determined that Zhang had already left. Q: Didn't you ask if he had actually left? A: I determined that he had already left, so I didn't ask. Q: When you got off the train, where did you tell Chen Fengshan that you wanted to kill Zhang? A: At the archway. Q: What did you tell him? A: I told him that Zhang had a blood feud with me and I wanted to kill him, but I didn't allow Chen to fire his gun randomly. When crossing the bridge, I saw that Chen was still following me. When I shot Zhang, I thought he was also behind me, but I'm not sure. At this point, the details of the shooting were asked again in detail. Zheng's statement was the same as before. Q: Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun, when you shot Zhang, where did you see them? A: When I announced that I had killed Zhang, I saw a person fall on the second platform. I don't know who it was or how they died. Q: Did you think Zhang had many followers? A: He had been a military governor, so I expected he would have many followers. Q: Did Chen Fengshan help you shoot? A: No. Q: If he didn't help you shoot, why did you ask him to follow you? A: He usually followed me wherever I went. He followed me to the charity association and to the train station that day. Q: Did he follow you to the second platform? A: I think he probably followed me. Q: What kind of gun did you carry, and what was the caliber? A: A Mauser pistol. I don't remember the number. It was loaded with eight bullets, and I carried two extra clips. Q: How many bullets did Chen Fengshan's gun have? A: Only one clip. His gun couldn't carry many bullets. I don't remember the number either. Q: Were both guns yours? A: Yes. Q: Did you have a passport? A: I got a passport when I moved from Beijing, but I haven't gotten one since then. Q: How many people were with Zhang when he ran? A: He was alone. Q: When you fired, were there other gunshots? A: Yes, but I don't know from which direction. Q: Did Chen get on the train when you got on the train to chase Zhang? A: I don't know. Q: How far was Liu Huaizhou's body from where Zhang died? A: I don't know. I only saw Liu Huaizhou after I was arrested. Q: Did you surrender yourself, or were you caught? A: I surrendered myself to the execution squad. I threw the gun away, confessed that I was avenging a murder, and asked to be arrested quickly, without arguing in court. Q: Why were you squatting on the ground after shooting Zhang? A: I was afraid Zhang's followers would chase and beat me. At this point, Bi Shizhen, the patrol chief of the southwest township, was also summoned. Bi testified that he was twenty-seven years old, from Pingyin, and was a patrol chief at the fifth branch of the southwest township public security bureau. He said he was ordered to maintain order at the station on September 3rd, at around 6 o'clock. The judge said, "Today, I'm calling you as a witness, you must tell the truth, otherwise you will be charged." Bi then made a written statement saying that he didn't know who shot Zhang Zongchang, he only saw a person wearing a gray gown raising a gun. He hid in the waiting room because he didn't have a gun. He brought three policemen with him to the outside of the station because the station was under the jurisdiction of the Jinpu Railway Police, not the southwest township. Q: Do you know Chen Fengshan? A: I don't know him. I only saw one person among Zhang's entourage with a gun raised, but it didn't fire. I didn't see the person. I arrested Chen Fengshan. I saw a person aiming at Zhang, but I don't know who it was. I only saw Zheng after I arrested Chen. Chen and Zheng were not arrested together. Q: You have to tell the truth, otherwise you will be sentenced to seven years in prison. A: I am telling the truth. He asked Zheng Jicheng again, "Bi still saw Chen at the time, why didn't you see him?" A: I don't know. He also asked Cao Yuke and Jia Chunhe, the two policemen that Bi brought that day. Their testimonies were similar to Bi's. He asked Zheng Jicheng again, "Who saw you chasing Zhang?" A: It was too rushed, I couldn't pay attention to it. Q: How many people were seeing him off? A: Only Zhang was alone. I didn't pay attention to whether there was anyone behind me when I chased Zhang. When I was arrested, I saw people being randomly arrested at the station, I don't know if Chen was among them. He also asked Bi Shizhen, "Didn't you say in the prosecutor's office that Chen Fengshan was the one who was aiming?" A: I didn't see clearly. He also asked Zheng, "You said in the prosecutor's office that if you could get Chen to the case, it might not be unfavorable to you." A: Now I don't know where he is. If he's in Jinan, he can be brought to the case. Q: According to your confession, your case is for avenging your father and for revolutionary work. Others also hate Zhang more than you do. You went home and had a glass of wine before thinking about revenge. Why didn't you go after eating? A: I was afraid he would leave. Q: Who is Qi Lantian, who took the car to the city government with you? A: He was just hanging around. Q: What did you mean by asking Chen Fengshan to follow you? A: To protect me. If I failed to kill Zhang and was killed instead, he could collect my body. At that time, there were many people with Zhang who could have beaten me. I didn't care because I was avenging my father. After the testimony was completed, the debate began. Chief Prosecutor Zhu Weiran stood up first and described the course of the case, roughly saying that Zheng Jicheng heard people say on the road that Zhang Zongchang was coming to Shandong again and was going back to Beijing again, and that it would be too easy for him to let him go. Therefore, Zheng Jicheng suddenly remembered the hatred of Zhang Zongchang killing his father, went home, took a handgun, and went with Chen Fengshan by car to Jinpu Railway Station to carry out his revenge plan. Zhang Zongchang and Liu Huaizhou were killed at the time, and Liu Qingxun was injured. Chen Fengshan was indeed at the scene. After the gunshots, Captain Meng of the armored car unit and Patrol Chief Bi of the Public Security Bureau chased after him and told him to stop. He raised his hand and said he was avenging our military commander (the military commander was Zheng Jinsheng). Afterwards, Chen also told Meng and Bi that he was avenging his military commander, which proves that there was a prior discussion. When Zhang Zongchang arrived in Jinan two days before, the local newspapers all recorded that he had many followers. The next day, the local newspapers also recorded it, and Zheng Jicheng also confessed that he knew Zhang Zongchang was coming from reading the newspapers. He certainly knew that Zhang had many followers. Zheng also confessed that when he went to the station on the 3rd to assassinate Zhang, he thought that Zhang Zongchang had been the military governor of Shandong, so he could have many followers. He could have expected that Zhang's followers would save Zhang when he assassinated him, but he had to shoot Zhang in order to achieve his revenge, so it can be presumed that the defendant had this intention. From this point of view, Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan went to the station at the same time with an overall agreement to kill. According to Articles 284, Paragraph 1, Items 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, it is premeditated murder. According to the first half of Article 74 of the same law, if one act constitutes two crimes, the heavier punishment should be imposed. However, after the incident, Zheng Jicheng immediately surrendered to the execution squad, which he confessed himself, and he also inquired at the Third Route Army Court, which proved that he did indeed surrender with a gun at the time, which can reduce the punishment. That is my opinion. Please render your verdict according to the law, Your Honor. The judge asked Zheng Jicheng again if he had any arguments. Zheng replied, "I don't know the law. The indictment says that I premeditated. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have eaten. And premeditating revenge doesn't necessarily mean killing him, there are many other ways."

<h3 id="e83">Communist Bandit Disturbances in Rizhao <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The mountains in Rizhao County are layered and close to the East China Sea, and have always been a place for bandits to infest. Previously, there were bandit leaders Zheng Quanqin (nicknamed Zheng Lei Liuzi) and Shi Yicheng, who gathered bandits and plundered in all directions, making the people unable to live. Fortunately, the county government sent police to arrest Zheng and imprison him, and Shi was also shot and killed, so the place was peaceful. Unexpectedly, the remnants of Zheng and Shi recently joined forces with the communist bandits to attempt a large-scale riot. Many bandits in the north and south townships echoed them, and they have gathered more than a thousand people. The war between Han and Liu in Jiaodong has not yet ended, and communist bandits have been found in Rizhao again. Shandong is really an eventful autumn today. The details of the bandit chaos in the county are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparations: Since recent years, the Communist Party has repeatedly sent people to the four townships in Rizhao to carry out activities and collude with bandits to strengthen their momentum. Some villagers have also been misled by them. In July and August this year, Shanzihe Village in the southwest of the county jointly refused to pay rent. In September, the Communist Party secretly supplied wages and weapons by sea, and there was also talk of brewing an uprising. Some of the leaders have been reported to the county government, and the government is planning to search and arrest them, but the bandit chaos has already begun.</p>
<p>Riot Situation: The bandits, knowing that the matter had been leaked, gathered hundreds of people and launched an attack early on the 13th of this month. They first went to Wangjiatan, surrounded the salt police, and the two sides started firing. The salt police were outnumbered and three were killed by the bandits. The rest were bound and their weapons were taken away. The bandits obtained about 50 guns. They also went to Yujia Village nearby and confiscated 30 guns from the self-defense corps. Later, they also confiscated the guns from the militia groups in Dongjiakou, Anjialing, and Dacun, in varying numbers. Then they turned to Shanzihe, Moujia Xiaozhuang, Jiacang Town, Pingjia Village, Miaojia Village, and Gaolu in the south of the city, and collected about 500 guns. The number of bandits was about a thousand, and their momentum was huge. All the villages paid protection money. The bandits once planned to occupy Taoluokou (a seaport), but they failed because the defenses there were tight. It is reported that the bandit leaders are An, Zheng, and Ding, and there are also academic figures from various villages. Those who echoed them are tenant farmers and laborers from various villages, mostly from the proletariat. They are now based in Anjia Dacun in the north and centered on Miaojia Village and Pingjia Village in the south. Since receiving the alarm, the county authorities have telegraphed the provincial government and requested that troops be sent to suppress them as soon as possible. (October 15)</p>

<p>The First Army Headquarters Commends the First Division</p>
<p>Zhang Meixin's Department of Sannan Stationed in Gupei Anyuan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: This time, the First Army of Guangdong conquered the bandit den of Dawangdong in western Jiangxi, and the Red bandit Peng Dehuai suffered heavy losses. This battle was a rare bloody battle since the First Army entered Jiangxi. Fortunately, the soldiers gave their lives and finally occupied the bandit's base. Countless bandits' food and luggage were seized. When attacking the bandit area's defense line, Li Zhen, the first regiment commander of the first division, took the lead and killed many enemies, but he himself was also hit by a stray bullet and injured his left shoulder. Fortunately, it was not a vital part, and he was immediately sent back to Ganzhou for medical treatment. The First Group Headquarters here reported that all the soldiers of the First Regiment of the First Division gave their lives in this battle, which is commendable. It has telegraphed the Ganzhou Division Headquarters to appropriately promote and reward capable officers and soldiers, and Regiment Commander Li Zhen will be rewarded with 1,000 yuan for medical expenses, which will be issued on the spot at the Division Headquarters to encourage meritorious service. After the bandit area of Dawangdong in western Jiangxi was broken, the bandits' flames were slightly curbed, so the Sannan garrison Xiang Hanping's department in Jiangxi was also able to advance with peace of mind without worrying about the left. Recently, Zhang Meixin, the fourth division commander of Xiang's department, has led his regiments to advance to Gupei and Anyuan. On the 10th of this month, Kong Kequan's department of the 10th regiment of Zhang's division entered Gupei, and Jiang Wu's training regiment also set out from Dingnan on the 7th and entered Anyuan on the 9th. The recent telegram from the front (Fourth Division Victory Report) is recorded as follows: [The duty division’s tenth regiment Kong Kequan’s department, Jiari reported that the Anxi area was captured by four to five hundred communist bandits, etc., immediately led the team to divide the way to suppress, and fought fiercely with the bandits for two hours, the bandits retreated to the mountains on both sides of Shibei Gupei, a total of more than ten bandits were killed in this battle, dozens of bandits were injured, it was found that the red bandits were the pseudo twenty-first army Huang Da’s department, the number was about five hundred, the bandits were defeated and retreated to Gupei, and contacted the red bandit pseudo fifth army, the total number of bandits was about one thousand, and immediately led the team to Gupei, contacted the bandit sentries in Taipingxu, the bandits resisted slightly, then divided into groups of twenty or thirty people, scurried up the mountains, and stubbornly resisted step by step, after our army occupied the mountains, they sent teams to search along the way, and there was some contact, the bandits retreated to Shikuo Fengnao Daqiaotou and other places, and Gupei was occupied by our army, the number of bandit casualties in this battle is unknown, now summoning the people to handle the aftermath, respectful report, duty Meixin respectfully, grey], (October 13)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Xia Douyin Has Dispelled His Intention to Resign <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Because Jiang Replied with Comforting Letters and Still Worked Hard Despite Illness</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xia Douyin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, previously submitted a request to Commander-in-Chief Jiang to send personnel to replace him due to his serious illness, and has not been to the government office since the 11th. Jiang replied with a letter of condolence on the 16th, instructing him to work hard despite his illness, roughly saying, "Hubei Province is a depleted area, and after the devastation, you have worked hard to manage and govern with vigor and are prepared for virtuous labor. Now I hear that your Qing illness has not yet healed, and I am especially concerned. During this period of moving bandits, everything is waiting to be done, and we rely on you to personally supervise and direct it to achieve complete success as soon as possible. I hope you will consider the difficulties of the times and try to support it, and at the same time take care of yourself and still work as usual to promote progress. This is my sincere hope. The request to grant leave for recuperation and send personnel to act on your behalf should not be discussed," etc. After receiving the letter, Xia was very moved and presented another letter to Commander-in-Chief Jiang on the 17th, reporting on his illness and declaring that he would work hard despite his illness. The letter said, "[Your subordinate Douyin previously thought that his illness was too serious and could not be expected to recover quickly, so he requested Your Excellency to grant leave for seven days for treatment and also requested that personnel be sent to act on his behalf to avoid delaying important matters. Recently, I received a warm and earnest handwritten reply from Your Excellency, comforting and caring for me, and at the end, it stated that the request to grant leave for recuperation and send personnel to act on your behalf should not be discussed, etc. After receiving this, I should admire Your Excellency's sincere intention to govern vigorously and work hard despite my illness. On the one hand, I will see a doctor for treatment. However, although the symptoms have been slightly reduced in recent days, the illness has been dormant for too long and there has been too much blood in the stool, making it difficult to recover at once. I respectfully present the details of the situation to Your Excellency. The reason is that Douyin has always had the disease of blood in the stool in the large intestine, and it occurs once a month. In the summer of this year, the weather was extremely hot, causing heat toxins to be latent and forming abdominal distension. When autumn gradually cooled, the suffering of dizziness and headache increased. On the 8th of this month, I saw a doctor and took medicine. On the night of the 9th, I suddenly felt fever all over my body, abdominal pain, and the phlegm qi reversed, blocking my throat, and breathing was almost impossible. The situation was very dangerous. I quickly called a doctor to see me, and after taking the prescription, the phlegm qi subsided, but coughing, sore throat, and swollen gums and temples occurred. On the morning of the 10th, I still wore cotton clothes and forced myself to go to the government office to work. Unexpectedly, that night, all the symptoms increased, and the abdominal pain was like cutting, so I collapsed. According to the doctor, the phlegm was congested in the upper energizer and the blood was stasis in the lower abdomen. I took Da Chaihu and Taohua Chengqi Decoction and changed clothes four or five times, and passed several bowls of stasis blood, and I was able to eat a little the next day. However, after that, taking medicine and passing blood did not improve the illness. When the effect of the medicine passed, the illness returned to its previous state. As of the evening of the 16th, although all the symptoms had been slightly reduced, the lower abdomen was still painful, and the blood that was passed was small in quantity and black in color. According to the doctor, the accumulated stasis had been too long, and it was impossible for herbal products to work. It is appropriate to use a large dose to attack and remove it to be effective. So I took Da Huang and earthworm pills to specifically attack the stasis of blood, and passed a small amount of black blood overnight, and I felt a slight reduction in the illness, and the dizziness stopped. However, there was too much blood in the stool, and the righteous qi was greatly depleted, and the spirit was exhausted, and it was still difficult to walk.</p>
<p>The remaining symptoms are not clear, and I must continue to take medicine. During this period of suppressing bandits, Your Excellency is worried about the hardships day and night, how dare Douyin be self-indulgent and idle? I have stated the details of the illness and the end of the matter to Your Excellency in accordance with the instructions from before. I beseech Your Excellency, on the one hand, to follow Your Excellency's earnest request for treatment and to work hard despite my illness. When presenting this letter, I cannot help but feel extremely frightened. Also, Director of Pacification He Chengjun previously returned from Longgang and planned to go to the counties in southern Hubei for inspection the next day, but he was unable to do so due to illness. He entered the hospital for treatment on the 17th, and it was also heard that he had asked Jiang for two weeks of leave. The routine official duties of the pacification office were handled by Chief of Staff Yang Jiyi, and important matters were still sent to the hospital for approval. (October 17)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Zhang Ming Telegraphs to Advise the Two Lius to Cease Fighting <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since the two Lius in Sichuan started a dispute, it has almost become an unstoppable trend. The central government is concerned that the outbreak of the Sichuan war may hinder the mediation of the Kangzang dispute, and is planning to send personnel to Sichuan to persuade the two Lius to abandon their past grievances, cease fighting and strengthen the frontier. Zhang Ming, the former special envoy sent by the National Government to Nepal, has done a lot of research on the southwestern border affairs since returning to China and has written an article on the great plan for governing Tibet, which he submitted to the government for adoption. He is particularly concerned about the internal strife in Sichuan this time and recently telegraphed Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang, urging them to realize the importance of the western defense, and to release their long-standing private grievances. The original telegram is recorded as follows: [Sichuan Chairman Liu and Military Governor Liu's Xun Jian, since the Shen Incident last year, the country has been in a state of distress, with the Communist Party causing trouble internally and the shame of losing land externally. All of our compatriots should unite as one and release their past grievances to overcome this crisis. Recently, police reports have come that Sichuan Province has once again started internal strife, and Tibetan soldiers are taking the opportunity to attack. The two of you are relatives in private and colleagues in public. Can't you resolve it in a peaceful way? Moreover, Sichuan is an important town in the western defense. If you lightly start a fight between the snipe and the clam, who knows if you will be taken advantage of by the fisherman? Moreover, our country's northeast has already been invaded and plundered by Japan, and it has not yet been restored, and the southwestern border is constantly changing. In the past, Nepal intended to invade Tibet, and Ming was ordered by the central government to go and confer honors. Nepal understood and returned to peace, but the dispute in Kangzang arose again, which was unexpected. When Ming went to Nepal in February, he went to the Tibetan border and other places to inspect. The people were mostly kind and attached to the central government. The reason why there were border police from time to time was only because the officials on both sides were not good at handling them. Liu, in his capacity as a concurrently held military governor, is responsible for urging the generals and soldiers of the defensive area, uniting feelings, and mediating with peaceful strategies, so that the border troubles can be eliminated invisibly. Recalling that when the Northeast and Shanghai affairs were just starting, the two of you telegraphed the government one after another, bitterly denouncing the scourge of civil war, which I deeply admire. Now, not long after that, it seems that you will not engage in fratricidal warfare again. Since returning to China from Nepal, Ming has paid great attention to the southwestern border defense. I am currently drafting a grand plan for governing Tibet and submitting it to the government. I think that the two of you, who are responsible for the western defense, must be willing to adopt one or two of them. I am attaching an article jointly written by Ming and Qian Junjiuwei on ways to solve Tibet. I hope you will give me your advice and stop the civil war immediately and permanently secure the border. It is the province of Sichuan, the party-state. Zhang Ming kowtows. ]</p>

<p>The Gan Family Property Dispute Case: Both Parties Sue: Gan Decai, a resident of Ganxiang Town in the county, passed away in the 7th year of the Republic of China, leaving behind one son and one daughter. His son, Yunsheng, had Chen as his adopted daughter-in-law. Later, Yunsheng passed away, and Chen was confirmed as an adopted daughter and found another son-in-law. With the consent of the relatives, there was peace for decades. In August of this year, Yunsheng's mother also died. At this time, his daughter, Gan, led her children to make a big disturbance at the funeral, almost making it impossible to complete the burial. Director Chen of the Louwu Building tried to mediate but failed. It is now heard that Gan has hired Niu to write a statement and filed a lawsuit with the county government to analyze and divide the inheritance, requesting that each party be divided equally.

<p>Ships on Dushu Lake Robbed: A Chen family ship traveling between Chefang and Suzhou was sailing from Chefang to Suzhou at about 10:00 am on the 18th. When passing Dushu Lake, it encountered more than a dozen bandits on the shore, each holding long and short guns, shouting to stop the ship and firing warning shots. There were also two bandits lurking on the ship in response. The ship owner had no choice but to dock the ship, and the bandits boarded the ship and looted at will before leaving with shouts. It is reported that the loss of goods and cash was about six or seven hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Shooting Case in the West of the City: The tragic shooting case in Fulangzhong Lane in the west of the city has been reported twice in this newspaper. The fire alarm and robbery were all misunderstandings. Fang Ziqing, a patrol officer from the Fifth Station of the Second Branch, saw Tian San, the servant of Ye Haimen's family, ringing the gong urgently and saying that there was a fire. Patrol Officer Fang immediately used the telephone to notify the Fifth Section Fire Brigade in the Western District. As soon as the phone was hung up, Tian San suddenly said that it was not a fire alarm but a robbery. Patrol Officer Fang immediately transferred the head of the class to divide the police and rush to ambush in the Youmapo Lane Shengjiabang Xiaofen Alley area, taking an encirclement approach. At the same time, members of the Fifth Section Fire Brigade in the Western District deceived Long and rushed to Youmapo Lane. The police officers declared that it was not a fire alarm but a robbery and stopped them from moving forward. Two police officers with guns and ammunition went straight to the sunning platform of the Ye family to investigate and saw two figures, so they fired a warning shot to the sky. The senior police officer guarding outside the door heard the sound and thought it was a robbery alarm and also fired in response. At that time, firefighters and passers-by heard gunshots in the chaos and fled one after another. The police officers mistakenly thought that the bandits were trying to escape, so they fired horizontally, causing this tragedy. Zhu Jintang, who was admitted to Guangmin Hospital for treatment, was transferred to Boxi Hospital at 1:00 am on the 18th and died at 10:00 am on the 18th due to excessive blood loss.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Food Relief Meeting Held in Wuxi: The Shanghai Local Association, considering this year's bumper harvests in various regions and the subsequent decline in grain prices impacting farmers' livelihoods and the overall socio-economic situation, deemed it critically important. Accordingly, it dispatched letters to chambers of commerce, rice merchant guilds, and peasant banks in rice-producing counties in Jiangsu province. These letters requested a food relief meeting to be held on the 17th at the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce. Mu Ouchu, Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, and Wang Zhixin were appointed to attend the preliminary meeting, with Director He of the Department of Industry invited to attend as well. By 5 PM, over twenty people had arrived, including Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, and Wang Zhixin from Shanghai; Zhang Zhongren, Zhang Jinbo, and Shi Junqing from Suzhou; Qian Linshu and Hua Mingchu from Wujin; Zhang Gongquan from Changshu; and Qian Sunqing, Cai Jianzhi, Gu Shuzhi, and Zhao Zixin from Wuxi. Director He and Wuxi County Magistrate Chen Zhongda also attended. Qian Sunqing was elected as chairman. First, the chairman and Huang Renzhi, representing Shanghai, reported on the motivation and process of convening this meeting. Subsequently, Director He reported on the proceedings of the National Food Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance on the 5th of this month. Three principles were generally agreed upon: (1) imposing import tariffs on foreign rice; (2) establishing a food regulation commission; and (3) facilitating the maximum circulation of domestic grain. On the provincial government's side, actions like investigating the production and consumption of rice, establishing rice cost standards, and deliberating on issues of rice price relief are all being actively pursued. However, the relief of the rice market depends on financing, and bankers are particularly hoped to provide assistance. Subsequently, representatives from Suzhou, Changshu, Wujin, Wuxi, Shanghai, and the Peasant Bank, among others, expressed their opinions. Director He summarized the consensus into the following points: (A) Regarding the Central Government: (1) Please clearly define food policies; (2) Waive various miscellaneous taxes on food, so that it can circulate freely within the country. (B) Regarding the Provincial Government: (1) Draft regulations to encourage and protect farmers' storage of food; (2) Organize food regulation associations and management agencies; (3) Supervise counties to implement warehouse preparation and mortgage methods. (C) Regarding local authorities: (1) Local authorities should organize food commissions to specifically handle food regulation matters. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM and the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce hosted a dinner for the representatives. The meeting continued the following day (the 18th) at 9 AM. Chairman Qian Sunqing summarized the points discussed the previous evening and presented a continuation of the discussion. Huang Renzhi proposed seven measures: (1) Request the government to promptly abolish the prohibition on rice circulation between provinces (starting with Jiangsu and Zhejiang); (2) Request the central government and provinces to abolish harsh taxes that obstruct circulation; (3) Request the government to promptly implement the imposition of import tariffs on foreign rice; (4) Request the government to suspend foreign wheat loans; (5) Rice-producing counties should promptly organize public warehouses to accept farmers' rice mortgages; (6) Request bankers in Shanghai and other regions to provide practical assistance to rice merchants who intend to accept rice mortgages or purchase rice; (7) Local authorities should procure and store the amount of food they need as an initiative for local residents to buy and store. Jiang Wenyu proposed: (1) Abolish the provincial ban on rice leaving the province; (2) Send representatives to negotiate with the Zhejiang Provincial Government; (3) Order local county governments and public security bureaus to protect food transportation; (4) Abolish rice license taxes; (5) The province should organize a people's food regulation commission and order each county to organize separately; (6) Request the national government to abolish foreign wheat loans; (7) Request the government to quickly establish methods for imposing import tariffs on foreign rice. All of the above were discussed and passed. Finally, it was decided: (1) To organize the Jiangsu Province People's Food Regulation Association; (2) To be jointly initiated by Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Wujin, Changshu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Wujiang, Qingpu, and Rugao counties; (3) To appoint Gu Shuzhi and Jiang Wenyu to draft the organization's constitution; (4) To hold an inaugural meeting at the end of this month in Zhenjiang; (5) The association will be located in Wuxi; (6) Wuxi will notify all counties about this meeting. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>Internal Affairs Inspectors from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Arrive in Zhenjiang: The Ministry of Internal Affairs will convene a national internal affairs conference within December of this year to discuss methods to improve and reorganize local administration and autonomy. Before the conference, special commissioners were dispatched to various provinces in three groups to understand the progress of administrative autonomy in each province. The first group is the North China Group, led by Vice Minister of Political Affairs Gan Naiguang. The second group, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Group, includes inspection commissioners such as Wang Xianqiang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department. The third group is the Anhui-Henan-Hubei Group, with inspection commissioners such as Zheng Zhenyu, Director of the Land Department. They will inspect both bandit and non-bandit areas. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang group, composed of Wang Xianqiang, Wu Shizhong, Wang Rongjia, and others, arrived in Zhenjiang from the capital yesterday morning and went to various agencies for inspection in the afternoon. According to Mr. Wu Shizhong, who spoke to the reporter, he said that the materials obtained from newspapers are mostly biased towards propaganda of the government's intentions and fail to truly convey public opinion. Therefore, an on-site inspection is necessary. This investigation will not focus on forms and tables, but on private conversations. The goal is to create a concrete plan based on the results of the investigation to be discussed at the national internal affairs conference in December. They plan to stay in Zhenjiang for one day today (the 18th) and travel to Huanglu on the 19th, then successively visit rural experimental areas in Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Fengxian, and Pudong before heading to Hangzhou and other places in Zhejiang for inspection.</p>

<p>Adultery with Wife and Abduction of Daughter: Zhang Changsheng from Wang Chen Village, Lugang District, Rugao, married Ms. Xu as his second wife after his first wife passed away. He had an adopted daughter, who married Chen Sanlin from Zhoujia Village. Later, Zhang went out to avoid bandits. Ms. Xu was raped and abducted by her clan nephew and a man named Fan Laibao, who hid her in Hejiabao. Not satisfied with this, Fan also abducted his adopted daughter, Chen Zhang, to Hejiabao to live with Xu. Zhang Changsheng found out that his wife and daughter had been abducted by Fan.

<p>Telegrams Sent Requesting Release of Detained Cargo Ships: The Jiaxing Kai Shen's cargo ships, Miu Songrong and Qiashengxiang, were detained by the Jianghai Customs this time and ordered to declare customs. After repeated negotiations, they have not yet been released. The County Chamber of Commerce has also sent representatives to negotiate. It is said that recently, all cargo ships sailing from Shanghai to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Moganshan, and Jiaxing must complete customs procedures. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that this method has not been publicly announced, and the Jianghai Customs' change of regulations and illegal detention of ships is hindering commercial transportation. In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the customs be ordered to release the ships, it also sent telegrams to the chambers of commerce in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other cities and counties, asking them to forward telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, arguing based on reason.</p>
<p>Tibetan Walking the World Arrives in He: On the 17th, various agencies in Jiaxing received a Tibetan man, [Hajjim,] who is walking the world and requested inscriptions and gifts. He said he departed from Tibet in August of the 9th year of the Republic of China, passing through Russia, Italy, Afghanistan, Denmark, Turkey, Arabia, France, and 18 provinces of China. Recently, he traveled from Guangdong and Fujian to Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and is now traveling from Hangzhou to He. On the 18th, he will take a waterway from He to Su.</p>

<p>New Cang Steamship Ordered to Cease Operations: The Nan Hui and Guang Ji steamships have been running in rotation between Pinghu urban area and Xincang Town. Several citizens from the Fourth District filed a complaint with the Department of Construction, stating that the Nan Hui steamship was operating without a road permit and requested that it be banned. After receiving the report, the Department of Construction immediately ordered the sixth branch of the second district's shipping department to order the Nan Hui steamship to cease operations. However, the Guang Ji steamship had also applied for a road permit, but had not received it. It was investigated by the sixth branch and was also banned. Therefore, transportation between Pingcang has been relying solely on Shaoxing rowing boats in recent days, which are slow and inconvenient, causing suffering to travelers.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Confiscates Japanese Yarn: The Lunxin Family Sock Factory in Ximen Canglong entrusted someone to purchase three pieces of yarn, totaling 120 packages, from the Shanghai Shenxin Mill. They were transported to Pinghu, but all of them were Japanese yarn with characters such as "Kabushiki Gaisha" on them. They were discovered and detained by the county's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. At a meeting the other day, it was decided to confiscate and burn the Japanese yarn and fine the factory owner, Qian, twice the value of the yarn (approximately 600 taels of silver) to be used for the Anti-Japanese Association's expenses. Qian has been notified to hand over the funds by the deadline.</p>

<p>Continued Issuance of 500,000 Yuan in Waterworks Bonds: The Hangzhou Municipal Government, in order to construct a waterworks, has obtained approval from the Provincial Government to issue 2.5 million yuan in waterworks bonds. They are encouraging citizens to donate three months' rent per household and soliciting donations from all sectors, with a total of 1.5 million yuan sold. The Preparatory Committee is simultaneously soliciting donations and constructing factory buildings and laying underground pipes. The first phase of the project was completed early and water has been officially supplied. Now, in order to complete the new plant's various facilities, improve the water source, expand the waterworks' main pipes and water pipe network, and add sand filtration ponds to clean the water source, it has been decided to continue issuing 500,000 yuan in waterworks bonds, using the land tax collected in Hangzhou in January of the 22nd year as the principal repayment fund. The interest guarantee fund will still be allocated by the municipal government from regular expenses. The bond face value has already been printed. Once it is signed and stamped, it can be issued and donations will continue to be solicited from all sectors to complete the entire plan as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Preliminary Thoughts on Reforming Chinese School Education <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>(Ten) Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>The reason for reforming university education: I believe the first thing is to establish the principle of emphasizing quality over quantity. In the future, the country does not need to establish any more universities. Local or private requests to establish universities should be strictly rejected by the government. Not only should new universities not be allowed to be established, but existing universities should also be greatly reorganized. In recent years, partly because the period when universities were most fashionable has passed, and partly because the Ministry of Education has cracked down on private universities, the number of universities is less than five or six years ago. However, according to recent statistics, there are still 13 national universities, 9 local universities, 17 private universities, 3 national colleges, 1 local college, and 12 private colleges, for a total of 64 institutions. This number is actually just a matter of too many but not enough. Among these universities, some have relatively complete facilities, are well-managed, and have a relatively high level. It is hoped that they will be able to join the ranks of world-renowned universities in the future. However, some are called universities, but it is a bit of a stretch. What should be corrected in particular is that there are several universities in the same place, containing the same departments and the same faculties, overlapping rules and regulations, and both talent and economy are wasted. I believe that the government should make a decision, and all duplicate departments and faculties in the same place should be merged. For universities that are better managed and closer to vocational schools, they should be unceremoniously ordered to change from universities to vocational schools. For universities that have a very promising future, they should be actively supported in their development.</p>
<p>Second, universities must enrich their content and improve their level. The existing university equipment is mostly rudimentary and just barely sufficient. It is already considered fortunate to be able to use it at all. The word "perfect" is simply out of the question. However, a university is definitely not just a few students, a few professors, and a few classrooms. Without a complete library, laboratory, factory, farm, etc., high-level research cannot be done at all. Therefore, for national universities, the government can merge overlapping departments and faculties. If it is believed that a certain department or faculty is doing nothing, it can be abolished. However, for those departments and faculties that are relatively successful, the government should allocate large amounts of funds for planned expansion in terms of equipment. For local national or private universities, those that are not well-managed can be closed down and those with too many departments and faculties can be merged. However, those that are relatively successful should be subsidized annually. In this way, with enriched content, professors and students will naturally feel more interested and achieve better results when conducting research. Entrance exams, semester exams, academic year exams, and graduation exams should all be extremely strict. Since universities emphasize quality over quantity, there should naturally be a strict policy of "better to have none than to have substandard" at the time of admission. And after admission, those whose level is too poor to achieve the country's purpose of cultivating talents can only be demoted at any time or asked to withdraw from school. One point to note about raising the level is that the current duration of university studies is too short. High schools are not well-run and the preparatory work is already poor. Universities also graduate in four years. It is no wonder that many university graduates lack even basic knowledge. I believe that the faculties of arts, science, agriculture, engineering, commerce, economics, law, etc. should be extended to five years of graduation, and the medical faculty should be extended to six years of graduation. Some may doubt that extending the graduation period will slow down the cultivation of talents on the one hand, and some students will be eager to make a living and cannot persist for a long time. In fact, a talent needs long-term nurturing and cannot be hoped for quick success. Talents who are quickly successful may not be able to meet the needs of the country. As for students who are eager to make a living, they should simply enter vocational schools instead of universities.</p>
<p>Both vocational schools and universities naturally have to charge tuition fees. However, among these schools, whether national or private, the state should set up many scholarships or loan amounts to reward students from poor families who have excellent grades so that they can pursue advanced studies. In this way, children from poor families can have an opportunity to receive higher education and their talents will not be buried.</p>
<p>The reason why normal universities should be separated from other disciplines and independent is the same as the reason why normal schools are separated from middle schools and independent, that is, normal students should bear a special responsibility to the country. Intermediate normal school students bear the responsibility of cultivating healthy citizens, while normal university students bear the responsibility of cultivating good middle school graduates, preparing to graduate from university and become the backbone of society in the future. What a great responsibility this is. We should not only hope that a normal university student will teach the courses he will teach in middle school well in the future, but also hope that he will cultivate his character, be brave in taking responsibility, and be a leader of young people in all aspects. Only with such middle school teachers can we cultivate middle school students with excellent personality, rich emotions, pure thoughts, and strong abilities. With such middle school students, they can become talents when they enter university and can take on the great affairs of the country. Since normal university students bear such a great responsibility, they should naturally receive special training while in school.</p>

Guo Moruo said, [Artistic rebel is brave, opening new paths to create strange paintings, the pen falls like turning the Yangtze River, and often comes to deceive creation.] Shen Enfu said, [Ask the lion why it does not rise, its anger has been stored for a long time, who is this intention like, is it not like national shame?] He also said, [Autumn color, is it the blood of patriotic men, or is it the magic of the brush?] Liu Yazi said, [The autumn forest is vast and boundless, with peaks on all sides, winding and passing through, who is the person who holds a staff and enters the mountain, I still suspect that there is a dark Hong outside the sky.] Zhang Jiasen said, [Nine streams and eighteen rooms, I have traveled there, but I only feel its secluded, verdant, and beautiful, how can there be strange peaks and rocks, as Liu Zi said, I have read Liu Zi's paintings many times, and I have personally seen his choice of beautiful scenery, which can see what people do not see] and feel what people do not feel] the pen is unrestrained and arbitrary, exhausting its emotions to produce it, then this painting of a reversed stone is like the tooth bed of Ming Taizu, how can we know that it is not what ordinary people do not see, but Haisu uniquely obtained?] Yesterday, Zhu Tingqi, director of the Nanjing Salt Affairs Office, Gu Shusen, director of the Ministry of Education, Shen Zhongyue, Cao Boquan, Chen Bangdian, Wang Jieliang, Xu Shanghao, and Fu Huanzhang sent congratulatory messages saying, [Beijing Road Lake Society forwards to Mr. Liu Haisu, the report that the municipal government is exhibiting Mr. Liu's European tour works, which is the pioneer of the Chinese Renaissance, opening the beginning of the grand convergence of Chinese and foreign art guards.

<p>At dawn the next day, I heard the sound of a pipa being plucked, and it was very close. I looked around and saw that our Paul was stroking his tennis racket, working on his remodeling doctorate!</p>
<p>De Guang is a person who likes to sleep very much, and he is often not getting enough sleep, so he easily won the title of Baby in our team. Compared to others who need six or seven years to get a doctorate, he is really lucky.</p>
<p>Because the hosts invited us to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, we set off and visited the mausoleum for a while, then went to the Central Sports Field, and then to Linggu Temple in Zijin Mountain. Outside Linggu Temple, there is a wooden house with murals by the painter Liang Dingming depicting the attack on Huizhou. It has been painted for three years and is still not finished. It is a great work.</p>
<p>Today's schedule was originally set for Shi Hua and me to play doubles against Yu Zhizhong and Zhao Minheng, famous players from Beijing, and Qiu Jiang's singles match, and Dao Zhang and Zhao Jia against Fei Hai and Bao Hua's doubles match. I was late because of an appointment with a friend, so I had to ask De Guang to take my place. De Guang injured his hand yesterday and was reluctantly playing with an injury today, and I felt very sorry for him.</p>
<p>The results of the three groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Liang Deguang (6|3 6|1) Zhao Minheng and Yu Zhizhong (Lin and Liang win) Qiu Feihai (6|4 6|1) Jiang Daozhang (Qiu wins)</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua (6|3 6|1) Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia (Qiu and Lin win)</p>
<p>Today's performances by Bao Hua and Fei Hai were well received. The best one was Qiu Jiang's singles match. In this match, Dao Zhang's playing style was completely different. I have seen Dao Zhang's many matches, and this was probably the best one. The volleys, long shots, forehands, and backhands were all excellent. The return shots were also suddenly much faster. If his opponent today had not been Fei Hai, he would have been defeated. Jia's playing style has become more and more cunning, and the balls he hits are often difficult to catch. Liang played with an injury and was inevitably a little tired. In short, our performance these two days was generally satisfactory and left a good impression on the visitors.</p>
<p>After the match, we packed our luggage and went to the Universal Club for a banquet hosted by Mr. Huang Shaoxiong and Mr. Chen Gongbo. Those present were all well-known figures. Mr. Lin Daoyang stood up to give a speech, and I responded on behalf of the team and reported on the situation in the world of tennis, and then offered some opinions on the tennis community in China, which can be roughly divided into three points: (1) It is not popular, (2) There is no training, (3) Enthusiastic promoters are short of funds. Therefore, I hope that there will be people with sufficient strength to promote it, and then the future of the Chinese tennis community can have new development. Then, Mr. Huang Shaoxiong, Mr. Chen Gongbo, and Mr. He Yingqin stood up and gave speeches, supporting my views and expressing their willingness to do their best to promote tennis in the future, and to select representatives to visit foreign countries in the future. After speaking, there was thunderous applause, and we started to feast.</p>
<p>After the banquet, at the suggestion of Mr. Chen Gongbo, we played table tennis for a while, and then they sent us to the station.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, we were already on our way home. In the shadows of our dreams, only the shouts of "Don't Forget" from the farewell party remained.</p>
<p>Looking back, the lights were getting farther and farther away, and the White Gate, where we had gathered for two days, was gradually disappearing in the distance.</p>
<p>Everyone felt very tired on the train, so they rested immediately, but the train was moving too violently and they couldn't fall asleep. Finally, when it dawned, we heard that the North Station was almost there.</p>
<p>Because of days of hard work and insomnia on the train, everyone was dazed when we got off the train, and even forgot about their bags.</p>
<p>After getting off the train, Fei Hai suddenly shouted strangely, and it turned out that the bag he was holding in his hand had disappeared sometime. After breaking out in a cold sweat, it was found in the hands of a friend. In short, we did our duty as citizens on this trip to Beijing, and we felt very happy, especially because Mr. Huang Shaoxiong and Mr. Chen Gongbo were willing to take on the mission of promoting tennis, and the plan to select representatives to visit foreign countries in the future is even more something we can never forget. I think that Mr. Huang and Mr. Chen will definitely realize their promises as soon as possible, and we will wait and see. (October 11, 21st year of the Republic)</p>

<p>Pivot Offensive Method: An invention often adopted by American professional basketball teams, invented by Dutch Dehnert. In this method, one person stands out on the free throw line as a pivot, acting as the core of the offense. It is represented as follows:</p>
<p>Number One (Pivot) stands with his back to the basket on the free throw line. Number Two, Number Three, Number Four, and Number Five move back and forth, left and right, passing the ball to each other, waiting for an opportunity to attack. If Number Four has an opportunity to pass the ball to Number One, he should immediately rush towards the basket after passing the ball. Number Two should also avoid his defender and rush forward. Number One should pass the ball to either Number Two or Number Four, whichever is more open. Otherwise, he can turn around and shoot himself (Number One). Otherwise, he can pass it back to Number Three or Number Five. The key to this method is speed. The pivot must have accurate passing, strong ball-handling, and well-practiced turning skills in order to fulfill his duties.

<h3 id="e115">Peiping Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Ban on Foreign Rice <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from the Peiping Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the matter of cheap grain harming farmers, there is a clear teaching in ancient times. China is located on the East Asian continent and is founded on agriculture. For more than four thousand years, it has had four hundred million people and forty million square miles of territory. Even with turmoil, the people have not lost heart because the rural economy is sufficient to maintain it. The reason why the rural economy is sufficient to maintain it is that the prices of agricultural products are balanced with the products of society and industry. Silk, hemp, grain, and beans are not lacking on one side and not crowded on the other. Therefore, no matter how political changes reach, the farmers remain calm. However, in recent decades, foreign grains have been imported into our country in large quantities. Even if agricultural products are not overproduced, they are inevitably threatened by imports, and there is a risk of land being abandoned. Therefore, the production of farmers is not enough to compensate for their original value, and their savings have been exhausted over the years. Between spring and summer this year, the price of silver dollars was lower than that of paper money. This kind of unprecedented strange phenomenon has never happened before. Some say that this silver dollar was originally stored in farmers' homes. The bankruptcy of farmers has forced them to spend all their savings in exchange for supplies. If the price of grain does not fall to the extreme, how can there be so many silver dollars flooding the market? Also, miscellaneous grains in the Suiyuan area can be exchanged for one hundred catties per yuan. Farmers employ labor for spring plowing and summer weeding, and the average cost of labor and capital is one yuan per person per day, plus the cost of three meals, which is nearly one yuan and sixty or seventy cents. From cultivation to harvest, how many people are employed and how much money is spent? May I ask, if one hundred catties of produce can only be exchanged for one silver dollar, how can there not be a loss? It is said, "When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows etiquette." How can we know that if agricultural products are too cheap, farmers may not have enough clothing and food? The majority of the national population is farmers. If the rural economy is panicked, there will inevitably be bandits everywhere and it will be out of control, which will have a huge impact on the foundation of the country. The dangerous situation has already appeared, and we are urgently thinking about ways to save it. Argentina is not a country with which China has treaties, but it also seeks to sell large quantities of wheat, corn, and other items in transit. We are shocked and do not know what to do when we see that the prices are very low. We urgently request the conference to find ways to prevent imported grains from entering the country in order to maintain the situation and eliminate hidden dangers. If Argentina, which does not have a treaty with us, intends to sell large quantities of food, how can we know that other countries will not follow suit? Alas, the foundation of our country, which is founded on agriculture, is shaking on its own. What else can we rely on? If we do not plan for this, I am afraid that the hidden dangers will be so great that we will have the worry of destruction without external pressure. Urgent plea, I hope you will investigate and quickly devise good methods to handle it, which is truly a matter of public interest."</p>
<p>Meeting to be Held Tomorrow. After receiving the letter, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce decided to convene a standing committee meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss relief methods and request the government to adopt and implement the results of the research.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Local Charitable Organizations Jointly Telegraph Requesting Order to Rectify Grain Storage <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Engaged in Relief for Many Years, Knowing the Source of the Problem</p>
<p>If You Want to Provide Emergency Relief, You Should Block the Outflow of Financial Resources</p>
<p>In recent years, grain prices in the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan have plummeted, and the suffering of farmers has reached its peak. Yesterday, charitable organizations in this city, including the Renji Charity Hall on Yunnan Road, the Xinwei Relief Association, and the Chinese Red Cross Society, jointly telegraphed requesting the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Interior and the provincial governments to rectify grain storage and prepare for famine. The original telegram is recorded below: To Secretary-General Chu of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, presented to President Song. We have found that disasters in our country occur frequently. Last year, we suffered another extraordinary flood disaster, and industry and commerce were depressed. The reason for the decline is due to the complete bankruptcy of the rural economy. In the spring of last year, imports of foreign rice alone reached more than 150 million. The country's finances and local vitality have been exhausted. We are deeply saddened and concerned. Although the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan have had a bumper harvest of rice and grain this year, it seems that the people can be relieved of their suffering. However, in reality, the suffering of farmers has not been alleviated and is even more severe than last year. Due to heavy taxes and transportation blockages in various provinces, the harvested rice and grain cannot be sold and the situation has become difficult. Low grain prices harm farmers and have a great impact. We have been engaged in relief for many years and know the source of the problem. If we want to find emergency relief methods today, we should block the outflow of financial resources and rectify grain storage to prepare for famine. We propose that you issue a clear order to the Ministry of Interior and the provincial governments to implement the former grain storage methods, properly plan the funds, and order all cities and counties under their jurisdiction to unite with local impartial gentry to carry out large-scale storage during the period of low grain prices, and seriously rectify them. Those without grain storage should be established within a time limit. Those with grain storage that are abandoned or have been empty for a long time should be restored immediately and should not be treated as mere formalities. Provincial warehouses should be established in each province, city warehouses should be established in each city, and county warehouses should be established in each county. Each year, new grain should be introduced and old grain should be removed, and local organizations should manage them jointly, eliminate malpractices, and implement new methods. With such a change, not only can the suffering of farmers be alleviated in the present, but also a long-term plan for famine preparedness can be established when grain prices are low. We jointly appeal to you to consider and accept our proposal.

<p>Has Been Sent to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>After the capture of Communist Party leader Chen Duxiu and eleven others, they were sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for preliminary hearings, which were concluded and transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. As reported yesterday, the police authorities, fearing that there were still remaining party members who had escaped, searched various places and sent detectives to guard them to observe the situation. On the 17th, at 3:30 PM, Peng Daozhi, the younger brother of Peng Shuzhi, who had been sent to the Public Security Bureau, suddenly went to No. 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, and was captured by the detectives guarding the house and taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. When questioned by the police chief, Peng claimed to be Guo Jinghao and denied being Peng Daozhi. After various proofs, he finally admitted his identity and was sent by Chinese and Western detectives to search his residence at No. 531 Baker Road. Many communist documents were found. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. Judge Zhao opened a court for preliminary hearings. Zhang Qinqing, an official from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, presented a letter, requesting a transfer. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the Municipal Council did not object to the transfer and could be transferred by the Public Security Bureau according to the agreement. The court ordered that Peng Daozhi be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be taken for interrogation.</p>

<p>Took Oath of Office on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Buyun, former director of the Hunan Air Force and anti-Japanese pilot of the 19th Route Army, was yesterday appointed as the Air Force Commander by Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army. Commander Xiao took office on the 15th of this month. His inaugural declaration stated: Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have ravaged the Northeast, occupied our territory, infringed upon our sovereignty, and massacred our people for over a year. Recently, they have further recognized the Manchukuo puppet government and spread various fallacies, hoping to deceive the great powers. All people with a sense of patriotism are filled with indignation and rage. The people of Northeast China deeply feel the crisis of national extinction and have risen up to save the country, charging into battle with unyielding determination. Recently, they directly attacked famous cities and achieved repeated victories, but unfortunately, they were ultimately defeated by enemy bombing, and their efforts were thwarted. Our National Salvation Army is now determined to thoroughly eliminate the violent forces and vows not to yield. We have specially organized an air force to resist and attack. Buyun, despite his limited talent, has been mistakenly entrusted with the important position of Air Force Commander by Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Volunteer Army. At this critical moment, it is our duty to kill the enemy and defend the country. In the past, I studied abroad and devoted myself to the aviation industry, determined to save the country.</p>
<p>I have long been prepared to sacrifice myself. Now that universal indignation prevails, I should take up arms and</p>
<p>lead the way, exterminate the main culprits, and have no regrets. I hope that all our compatriots at home and abroad will rise up and work together to turn the tide, recover our lost territories, and wipe out the national humiliation. This is my declaration, and I respectfully ask for your consideration.</p>

<p>Since the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team began soliciting donations of supplies from all walks of life, the results have been good. It is now known that the team convened a meeting of various sections at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the departure date and necessary preparatory work. As a result, it was decided that 50 team members, led by Deputy Captain Jiang Xing, would depart first on October 26th (next Wednesday). Starting immediately, those responsible for each section were appointed to begin departure procedures. It was also decided that a general meeting of team members would be held at 1:00 PM tomorrow (the 20th) to appoint responsible personnel to go to Beijing to request the Railway Department to allocate vehicles. At the same time, the physical fitness of the team members will be reviewed in preparation for departure. The following is their appeal to the public: Dear compatriots throughout the country, it has been more than a year since the September 18th Incident. The Japanese invaders, disregarding the world's disapproval, are implementing their colonial policy in Manchuria and Mongolia, occupying our Northeast, recognizing the puppet organization, seizing our government, forcibly collecting our customs duties, controlling our postal rights, and massacring our compatriots. Their crimes are heinous and unspeakable. Alas, our beautiful land has fallen into the hands of foreigners. This is our shame, how painful it is! Our country has a large population and strong forces, but we cannot resist the small number of Japanese invaders. The biggest reason is that our people are not united. Seeing the mansion about to collapse and the country changing color, our 400 million compatriots are all about to become slaves of a fallen nation. Speaking of this, we are in even greater danger. Fortunately, our Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting to the death, advancing wave upon wave, and fighting bravely, so that the dwarf invaders have not been able to drive straight in. Their great achievements are well-known. Therefore, people with a conscience who have not died see the Northeast Volunteer Army's repeated reports and the various hardships of the Volunteer Army, and it is truly our inescapable duty. At the same time, we see the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers as even more pitiable. Therefore, we have gathered people from all walks of life to organize the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to go out and treat the wounded soldiers. However, many supplies are needed, and the Volunteer Army is in urgent need of assistance. Therefore, we are soliciting donations from all walks of life. Fortunately, we have received the enthusiastic help of all walks of life. Our team has already decided to depart in batches on the 26th of this month. We will continue to raise funds in the rear and depart completely for the Northeast within two weeks to achieve the purpose of rescue and care. After our team departs, we still hope that all compatriots across the country will unite to provide assistance so that our team will not stop halfway. We will be deeply grateful.</p>

<p>Soliciting Donations from All Sectors</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Relief Federation for Northeast Refugees, and others, pleaded for relief for the suffering compatriots in Northeast China. Yesterday, they distributed donation books to overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life and sent letters requesting them to promote and widely solicit donations separately. The original letter is transcribed below: Dear Sir/Madam, The people of Northeast China have suffered both from war and floods. The tragic situation has been repeatedly appealed to in our association's newspaper reports, which you must have seen. Now that the weather is getting colder, the need for relief is even more urgent. Our association, which unites various charitable organizations, has branches in the three northeastern provinces that conduct detailed investigations of the disaster situation and distribute relief without difficulty. However, the area is vast and there are many refugees. It is not enough to rely on the collective efforts of the entire country to overcome the difficulties and reverse the catastrophe. We have long admired your enthusiasm for saving the people and the country. We have prepared this letter along with several copies of our association's articles of association, the report on the disaster situation in Jilin and Heilongjiang, and several donation books. Please accept them. We hope that you will consider that providing relief to the Northeast refugees is an urgent matter and quickly promote and widely solicit donations separately. By borrowing your high call, we can immediately see a crowd respond and save those in the gutters, which is to strengthen our country. One act of compassion is better than creating limitless merit. With the cloud sky in sight, we sincerely look forward to your help (rest omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e127">Dispute Over Import Tax on Fushun Coal After the Northeast Customs Blockade <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Customs Authorities Resolve to Collect Taxes in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, since the Northeast Customs implemented the blockade on the 25th of last month, it has been proceeding very smoothly for almost a month. Unexpectedly, in the most recent week, the import of Fushun coal has again threatened to cause disputes between China and Japan. Before the Northeast Customs blockade, the tax on each ton of Fushun coal was about one tael of customs silver. Recently, because the Northeast Customs implemented the blockade,</p>
<p>the customs authorities could not identify whether the coal was a local product, so it decided to collect import tax on it, which is estimated to be six or seven taels of customs silver per ton. The Japanese merchants, because of the significant impact they suffered, planned to use the 1902 agreement as an excuse to protest to us. According to reports, Mitsui &amp; Co. recently used the Shandong Maru to transport 4,000 tons of Japanese coal, using a fake national certificate, pretending it was Fushun coal, and shipped it to Qingdao. The local customs authorities inquired with the Shanghai General Taxation Department for a solution, and the local customs office has been instructed to collect import duties as usual. Yesterday, according to a definite message from the local customs authorities, the import tax has already been resolutely collected. Whether the Japanese side will actually protest is still unknown.</p>

It is now known that the detailed plan prepared by the Land and Finance Bureaus has been submitted to the Municipal Government, but because there are still inappropriate points in it that need to be revised, the Municipal Government has returned it to the two bureaus, ordering them to make revisions and then submit it to the Municipal Government for review and approval at the Municipal Government meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Food Committee Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Discusses Measures for Measuring Rice</p>
<p>Relieving the Plunge in Rice Prices</p>
<p>The Municipal Food Committee held its 37th regular meeting yesterday at the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss the measures of changing to using a level rice measuring device and relieving the plunge in rice prices. For the sake of prudence, the Municipal Party Headquarters was requested to send representatives to participate in the meeting. The attendees included Committee Members Lu Wenshao, Gu Xinyi, Wu Hengru, Sun Yongyi, Lin Dun, Chen Xuxi, Zhang Binghui, and Party Headquarters Representative He Yuanming, totaling more than ten people. Chairman Zhang Binghui presided over the meeting, and Zhou Honggang recorded the proceedings. After the meeting was opened as scheduled, the chairman reported on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting, and Committee Member Wu Hengru reported on the details of attending the Food Conference. Then, Committee Member Gu Xinyi reported on the local association's proposed measures to relieve the plunge in rice prices and the local banking industry's efforts to raise funds to accept rice as collateral for loans. Then, the discussion began on whether it was feasible to change to using a level rice measuring device. After two hours of discussion, it was resolved that the Social Affairs Bureau should be asked to deliver the device to the Municipal Metrology Testing Institute and periodically hire a rice measurer to use the usual method to test the standards for light and heavy loads and level loads. Relevant agencies and organizations should be invited to send representatives to participate in the research to ensure fairness. As for the issue of relieving the plunge in rice prices, the city should immediately follow the resolutions of the Central Food Conference and make efforts to handle it. On the one hand, the central government should be asked to issue a circular to all provinces to ensure that rice and grain can pass through without obstruction, and the Municipal Government should be asked to write to local associations and the banking industry to raise funds specifically for rice collateral loans. Secondly, regarding the plunge in grain prices, the central government should not borrow American wheat again to avoid harming the farmers' economy. It was resolved that the report on the central government's plan to borrow American wheat should be submitted to request that it be stopped.</p>

<p>Chengdu Businesses Have Stopped Importing Goods</p>
<p>Since the war broke out between Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang's armies in Sichuan, commerce has been greatly affected. The Sichuan businesses in Shanghai have a large volume of business, with cotton yarn and foreign goods being the main items, followed by colored goods and foreign needles. Since receiving telegrams from Sichuan, Chengdu businesses have stopped importing goods to avoid losses. However, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing, because they are not war zones, transportation has not been obstructed, so they still risk importing goods, mostly changing to postal delivery. Whether the arrival of goods will be obstructed due to the war is currently unpredictable, but it has also decreased sharply compared to before. As for the Shanghai-Yichang steamers, they rely on passengers and cargo, and although they are still operating as usual, the amount of cargo loaded each time is insufficient.</p>

<p>Establish a Committee to Implement a Save-Our-Hometown Plan</p>
<p>Since Chen Guohui, He Xianzhu, and Hong Wende were detained one after another, the Fujianese organizations in Shanghai believe that the provincial defense army that has harmed the people of Fujian has been completely eliminated. From now on, the wise and enlightened politics that the people of Fujian have dreamed of can be realized in turn. It is reported that the Save-Our-Hometown United Association of various organizations has established a Committee to Implement a Save-Our-Hometown Plan because the reform of Fujian politics in the future will be complicated and involve many issues. It has publicly elected the Minnan Association of Shanghai, the Xing'an Association Hall, the Jinjiang Huiguan, the Fujian National Crisis Relief Association, and the Quanzhou-Xiamen Agency Association to preside over its affairs.</p>

<p>Investigating the Industrial Situation in this City</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry previously ordered the International Trade Bureau to investigate the national industry. The bureau has now ordered its members to investigate Jiangsu and Shanghai first. According to He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, the investigation of Jiangsu is divided into southern and northern Jiangsu. The southern Jiangsu part has been completed and the northern Jiangsu part is being investigated. At the same time, personnel are also being sent to investigate Shanghai. However, the commercial prosperity of this city and the lack of understanding of this matter by the business community often make them unwilling to report truthfully, which greatly hinders progress. It must be known that investigating the industry is to plan for the relief of the industry.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Navy, considering that pilots are all foreigners, which greatly affects national defense, had previously advocated holding pilot examinations to reclaim sovereignty and consolidate national defense. Since the Shanghai war, this measure has been suspended in form. It is now known that She Zhenxing, Director of the Pilot Training Institute of the Ministry of Navy, believes that the pilot examination is urgent and will soon request the Ministry of Navy to schedule it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Business School Correspondence Program and the China Vocational Education Society Correspondence School are pioneering institutions in correspondence education and the only place for young people in the vocational sector to seek knowledge. Therefore, each semester's opening is marked by a portion of students making donations. While these are generally small donations due to limited means, the participation rate is very high. It is reported that the first round of contributions yielded over fifty yuan. Furthermore, a student from the Correspondence Program, Mr. Zhang, a poor merchant, donated his entire savings of nineteen yuan to the righteous army. This act is particularly commendable and is hereby recorded as an initial exemplary act.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Gospel for Muslims Making Pilgrimage to Mecca <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>New direct ships to Jeddah next year</p>
<p>Our country has a Muslim population of fifty million, mostly residing in Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces, followed by Yunnan, Zhili, and other provinces. There are also significant Muslim communities in Ningbo and Hangzhou in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and in Wuhan in Hubei. According to Muslim customs, believers who are economically well-off are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lifetime. Due to its remote location, most pilgrims from Xinjiang travel by land, passing through Siberia and Persia. However, for other provinces, sea travel is more convenient, so they usually come to Shanghai to board ships and then depart in groups, which has become a common practice, with the number of pilgrims increasing every year. Matters such as applying for passports, transporting luggage, and selecting ship berths before going abroad are entrusted to the China Travel Service, which has been assisting in these matters for six years. In the past, ship tickets were only purchased to Singapore, and transfer arrangements from there were handled by local mosques. However, due to the uncertain sailing schedules, pilgrims often suffered from not being able to make timely connections, resulting in unnecessary expenses and delays. The Travel Service repeatedly negotiated with the Blue Funnel Line on this matter, and finally, at the end of last year, was able to book combined steerage tickets from Shanghai to Jeddah. The first such voyage departed from Shanghai on January 10 of this year, first to Singapore, then transferring to a ship directly to Jeddah. This made the voyage more predictable and time-efficient. However, the need to transfer ships in Singapore was still inconvenient for travelers. In order to fully implement its service mission, the Travel Service repeatedly negotiated with the Blue Funnel Line to select direct ships. The company agreed and selected the "M.V. Memnon", which will depart from Shanghai directly to Jeddah. This ship is newly built and was launched in 1931. Its engines are diesel-powered, making it exceptionally clean and fast. The ship is huge, with a displacement of over 10,000 tons and a deadweight of 7,730 tons. It can carry 1,348 steerage passengers. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on January 29, 1933, and will pass through Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Colombo, and Aden before arriving in Jeddah. The entire voyage will take approximately 27 days. The ticket prices are as follows: Shanghai to Singapore, one-way, 30 yuan in national currency; round-trip, 60 yuan in national currency. Singapore to Jeddah, one-way, 127 Straits dollars; round-trip, 182 Straits dollars (Straits dollars are Singapore silver coins, with each dollar roughly equivalent to 1.90 yuan in national currency). Children under one year old travel free, and children aged one to twelve pay half price. Round-trip tickets are valid for two years. Muslims from other cities who come to Shanghai to wait for ships and handle departure procedures can stay at the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in the West Gate of Shanghai, free of rent, and provided with clean water and firewood. Meals are at their own expense. Passports can be processed in Shanghai. The Travel Service has compiled a special booklet detailing the procedures, titled "From Shanghai to Mecca," which will be published soon and distributed to Muslims for reference.</p>

<p>Special price: One yuan per copy</p>
<p>Publication on the 27th</p>
<p>The Chinese version of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission's report on Manchuria, compiled and printed by the Shanghai Shen Press, has become widely popular since its publication. The main sales outlets in the city, such as the Shen Bao Office on Hankou Road, the News Daily Office, and the China Bank on Sichuan Road, sold thousands of copies within two days, not including mail orders from other cities. Therefore, the initial print run of 10,000 copies will be sold out today. Seeing the national interest in the Dongbei incident, the press is further encouraged and decided to disregard costs and rush the printing plant to add another 10,000 copies to increase circulation. To limit sales and ensure equal distribution, the wholesale limit per customer will be temporarily set at 50 copies starting today. The limit will be restored after two days when sufficient stock is available. The press hopes for understanding from wholesalers for this necessary measure. Furthermore, the press will begin selling special price coupons for the combined Chinese-English edition at the above-mentioned sales outlets starting today. Each copy will cost only one yuan, and books can be picked up in one week. The press, recognizing the congestion during the last pre-order of the Chinese version, where latecomers often missed out, has also appointed the China Travel Service in Hongkou, Tilanqiao, Jing'an Temple Road, and the French Concession's Eight Immortals Bridge to sell the coupons, so that residents in the western district can order nearby.</p>

<h3 id="e141">The Fresh Pork Industry Representatives Telegraph for the Release of Detained Ships from Jiangbei <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from the Fresh Pork Industry Association of Jingjiang New Port in Jiangbei reported to Shanghai yesterday that three ships loaded with pigs belonging to Hong Gao Ji, Wang Chang Ji, and Chen Zheng Ji from the port were detained by the Business Tax Bureau Branch Office for allegedly evading business taxes. Upon hearing this, the representatives believed that the detention of ships for tax collection by the Business Tax Bureau was illegal and tantamount to disguised likin. After discussion, they urgently telegraphed the competent authorities, requesting them to order the release of the ships. The original telegram reads: "To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance, Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government Department of Finance: The Business Tax Bureaus of Jiangbei Jing, Ru, and Tai counties have misinterpreted the department's orders and illegally set up checkpoints to intercept and collect road tax on pigs. Merchants have protested and telegraphed for the abolition of this practice, and the Chamber of Commerce has also sent letters to the tax bureaus requesting a delay in collection. However, the tax bureaus have disregarded the merchants' situation and insisted on their own way. Initially, they sent police to force collection, and now they are detaining cargo ships, causing public outcry. Fresh pigs are live goods and need to be fed. Once detained, they are in danger of starving to death. Who will be responsible for this loss? We hereby urgently request the Yuan, Ministry, and Department to order the county tax bureaus to immediately release the ships, so as to save capital and avoid accidents. The Temporary Joint Representatives of the Fresh Pork Industry in Jiangsu Counties."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association received letters from over a hundred public organizations, including the Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association and the Zhabei War Zone Disaster-Stricken Business and Industry Federation, stating that the fires in Zhabei had caused enormous losses. Those disaster victims who had fire insurance were relying on compensation as a lifeline. However, the insurance companies were trying to evade responsibility, and negotiations had made no progress. As this matter concerns the interests of the public and the revival of business and industry, the Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association should uphold its fearless spirit, work hard, and achieve the goal of compensation. The organizations pledged their support and vowed to serve as a backing. The compensation association is currently awaiting mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. If the insurance companies continue to lack sincerity, active negotiations will be inevitable, and they will not give up until they achieve their goal. A meeting of the entire compensation committee will be convened this Friday (the 21st) to discuss the way forward.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of Parks of the Shanghai Municipal Council reports for the month of September: Since the reopening of Hongkew Park on March 19, the lawn tennis courts were open for 106 days during this summer, except for 35 rainy days. Thirty-nine tennis courts were assigned to thirty-five club-like organizations. There were also five hard tennis courts which have been distributed. The grass courts were available for use for 140 days from May 15, because the surface did not accumulate water. The baseball field was used 78 times. There were also many golfers. A total of 178 permits were issued. In total, 29,287 people came to play various ball games in the summer, including in Hongkew Park and Wayside Park.</p>
<p>Open-air concerts: There were two concerts this month, five steel band concerts, and two military band concerts. The season ended in the middle of the month. On the last day, there was a joint performance by military bands. On that day, 13,707 people visited Jessfield Park, and 1,539 people were seated to listen to the music.</p>
<p>Visitors in September: Jessfield Park and Zoo had a total of 59,030 visitors; Hongkew Park had 16,883 visitors; the Bund Park had 41,402 visitors; and other parks had 43,082 visitors.

<p>A lawsuit to recover unpaid rent</p>
<p>The houses in the East-West Chongye Lane on North Sichuan Road are located in the war zone. After the January 28th Incident, they were devastated by the enemy, and business was suspended for more than four months. Recently, the rent collector, Chen Guisheng, showed no consideration and forced the tenants to pay the rent for April, May, and June during the war. The tenants refused to pay, arguing that the renters could not use or benefit from the premises before the enemy troops had withdrawn. Chen Guisheng then sued in the Special District Court in the name of the British company Tonghe. The tenants were represented by lawyer Lu Qi, who argued that North Sichuan Road was located in the Chinese area, and the plaintiff should not sue in the Special Court, as it was a jurisdictional error, and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The Special Court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's claim. Chen, together with his lawyer Zhou Yu, then sued in the District Court in the name of the British company Tonghe's Westerner, Sachs. Judge Wang Run opened a court session yesterday to inquire in detail about the number of months owed by the tenants and the reasons for not paying the rent. After the plaintiff gave a vague answer, the tenants were still represented by a lawyer, and the audience seats were full. Lawyer Lu stated that the first issue to be resolved was whether the landlord of the disputed rental house was the Western company Tonghe or a Chinese citizen, and whether the Western merchant's name was being used without authorization. According to the defendant's investigation, the original landlord was Sun Chunsheng, who later transferred the property to Chen Shaodi. The Westerner had no ownership rights, so how could he file a lawsuit? If the plaintiff insisted on having a Western merchant come forward to sue, the court should order the plaintiff to present evidence of the transfer of the disputed rental house to prove that Tonghe company owned the property to justify the suit. The court agreed to the request, ordering the plaintiff to submit evidence of Tonghe company's purchase of the disputed houses to prove that the property was owned by that party before a decision could be made. The plaintiff argued without listening, and the judge adjourned the court.</p>

<p>At 7:35 PM the night before last, Zhang Xiaodong, a patrol officer from the First Police Station of the Second District General Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was patrolling the Da Xin Jiangyin Street area in his jurisdiction. When he arrived near the Shajia Lane west of Lujiabang, he suddenly noticed three suspicious-looking youths walking towards him. As Patrol Officer Zhang was about to order them to stop and interrogate them, one of them suddenly drew a pistol and fired a shot at Zhang, hitting his lower right leg. At that moment, Zhang, without regard for his own safety, desperately chased after them and grabbed one of the bandits around the waist. The bandit was captured and a six-inch revolver with three bullets was seized. They were taken to the district station. After questioning by District Chief Jin, the captured bandit identified himself as Li Genxi, a native of Hubei, and revealed that there were many accomplices hiding in the living room upstairs in the house of Zhu Qizeng, a landlord in Xieqiao Baoshan Li. After receiving the information, District Chief Jin immediately ordered Detective Team Leader Han Ruisheng and Dong Minghai, along with detectives Cao Baolin, Zhu Fusheng, Xu Youliang, Liang Guangqing, Lu Yaoliang, and two long-term police officers, to take the bandit to the address. Upon arrival, detectives Cao Baolin and Zhu Baisheng bravely climbed the stairs and rushed into the room. They found more than ten bandits playing mahjong inside. The two detectives immediately raised their guns and ordered them to stop. At the same time, the detectives downstairs continued to rush up and surrounded the bandits, arresting them all. The arrested included Zhu Maotang, Shi Jinhao, Li Tinghui, Lin Baoming, Lu Nianshu, Wang Wanxing, Li Da, Ma Fengxiang, Ma Shousheng, Li Yufei (all from Hubei), Yan Fengqi (from Tianjin), Yang Qingyu (from Hunan), Dai Kaigong (from Jiangsu), along with landlord Zhu Qizeng, a total of fourteen people. All were taken to the district station, interrogated separately, and the bandits revealed the hiding places of major criminals involved in the shooting of a police officer. The detectives were dispatched to capture the bandits, but they had already fled upon hearing the news. The District Chief Jin, considering the severity of the case, immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Monk Jumps into Huangpu River <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Practicing asceticism to avoid disaster</p>
<p>Still cannot achieve true fruition</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a young monk suddenly appeared at the Nanmatou riverside in the South City. Taking advantage of the lack of attention, he jumped into the river. Fortunately, a worker from Jiu Ji Lumber Company spotted him and rescued him. He was resuscitated and taken to the nearby Nineteenth Post by police officer Wu Shutang. During the preliminary hearing by the precinct chief, he was questioned why, as a monk who had emptied himself of all worldly desires, he was so stimulated as to attempt suicide by jumping into the river. The monk claimed his dharma name was Guangwu, and he was a devout Buddhist who went by the secular name Yang Yonglin. He had become a monk at Tianzhong Temple on Tianzhong Mountain. Recently, he came to Shanghai to collect old paper scraps on the streets to accumulate merit. Today, while walking along the Nanmatou riverside, he accidentally slipped and fell into the river. He denied attempting suicide and claimed he was very fortunate to have been rescued by a worker and not drowned. He said, "When my master was alive, he told me that if I practiced asceticism and did not experience disaster, I would not achieve true fruition." After speaking, he clasped his hands together, looked up, and shouted, "Namo Amitabha! Master, Master, I have suffered a great disaster! Please quickly take me to the Western Paradise! Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva!" Observing that the monk appeared to be suffering from a mental illness, the precinct chief prepared a document and submitted it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

<p>A new movie theater, called Rongguang Theater, has been built at the intersection of Haining Road and Zhapu Road. It occupies a vast area, and its architecture is extremely magnificent. Inside the main entrance, there is a large hall for the audience to rest and stroll. The layout is elegant and novel, unlike any other movie theater. Further in, there is the auditorium, with over two thousand seats. All equipment is state-of-the-art. It features heating in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, with temperature regulation to avoid excessive cold or heat. The wall lighting is installed using the latest scientific methods and is not dazzling. The sound movie equipment used is also the latest American-made, providing exceptional clarity. The movies shown are exclusively from MGM, whose high value is generally recognized by the audience. However, the low ticket prices are unprecedented, divided into three levels: 30 cents, 50 cents, and 80 cents, day and night. Managers Lu and Liang are both experienced professionals in this field and are actively preparing for the grand opening.</p>

<p>The League of Nations Inquiry into the Manchurian Incident, which has attracted worldwide attention, has been published. The issue of treaty compliance in the report is of particular concern to the Chinese people. However, the general public lacks suitable supplementary books when studying the League of Nations report.

Its content is extensive and detailed, especially regarding the history of the Northeast issue and the various international treaties signed throughout history. It is a perfect reference material for studying the League of Nations report. The original author of the book, Professor C. Walter Young of the University of Washington, is an expert on the Northeast issue. Since the September 18th Incident, Professor Young has been concerned about the Northeast issue and came to China to investigate in person. After the investigation team arrived in China, he was hired as a consultant to the team, which shows the value of his work. The translator, Mr. Jiang Xingde, is experienced in international politics and has written extensively. His translation is fluent. The book is a thick volume and sells for $1.50. It is available in major bookstores both in this city and in other cities.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Busting a Private Red Pill Manufacturing Operation <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Detectives Tao Desheng and Lu Zhaolin, along with Liu Jinrong and Xie Guangming, discovered a private red pill manufacturing operation located at 145 Huageo Road, a three-story building. They raided the premises on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and arrested the manufacturers Zhou Wenrong, Wang Asan, and Zhang Jiangyu. They seized 75 pounds of finished red pills, 17 pounds of unfinished red pills, three sets of rollers, three sieves, seven bags of stone powder, one small bag of sign paper, thirteen cloth bags, twenty-eight seals, two drying ovens, one mixing cup, and other items. They also arrested the second landlord, Qiao Tongchang, and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for questioning. The police attorney, Gu Shouxi, explained the case, stating that the main offender, Yang Shuqin, a native of Guangdong, lived at No. 3 Xinpingli, Longmen Road, in the Public Concession. An order was issued for his arrest, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. The three arrested, Zhou, etc., are all Yang's accomplices. Qiao Tongchang claimed that he was the second landlord and had rented the three-story building to Yang Shuqin, but he was unaware of the private red pill manufacturing operation. Judge Xiong Yinhua ordered the defendants Zhou, Wang, and Zhang to be detained and ordered Qiao Tongchang to be released on bail, pending the arrest of Yang Shuqin for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e151">More People Involved in the Chen Tugen Case <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Inspector Huang Zicheng is also implicated</p>
<p>The deceased's wife will intercept the mayor's car to file a complaint</p>
<p>In the case of Ling Jiannan, a native of Chuansha in Ximen Ningkangli, who was killed by Wang Wencai and others, accomplice Chen Tugen was apprehended on the spot by the deceased's wife, Ling Ni. He was detained in the detention center of the District Court. Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, due to the release of a flower society criminal with the same name, Chen Tugen, the murderer Chen Tugen was also released. By the 8th or 9th, the news had spread throughout Shanghai, and the rogues in the city knew that the Tugen from the flower society was a disciple of the murderer Tugen, and that his escape was pre-planned. Therefore, the Chen Tugen from the flower society deliberately ordered someone to report him to the police, as a proxy for the actual criminal Chen Tugen. They reasoned that since the murderer Tugen had been released, the flower society Chen Tugen could not be treated as a murderer under the law. Therefore, a group of rogues in the city were openly discussing the "double release" (meaning released together) in teahouses and wine shops, calling it a marvel. The masses outside had spread the news first, and then it was learned within the detention center. Therefore, there was an investigation and arrest. However, how could there be anyone still waiting for the law to be enforced? The deceased's wife also confirmed the rumor to be true and filed a complaint with her superiors, requesting a thorough investigation. Subsequently, after the news was published in the newspaper, it was heard that a chief prosecutor's order was suddenly posted in the gatehouse of the detention center yesterday, stating that all officials of the court were prohibited from leaking information to newspapers and that permission from the chief prosecutor was required for any reporting, so as not to hinder the progress of the proceedings. Therefore, it is impossible to find out how the case is progressing in these turbulent times. However, the deceased's wife, Ling Ni, had previously accused Inspector Huang Zicheng of the Municipal Public Security Bureau of being an accomplice in the case, but he had not been apprehended. The day before yesterday, Ling submitted a written complaint accusing Huang Zicheng of committing violence and claiming that the detention center was negligent in its duties. Unable to directly reach the mayor, she waited in front of the municipal government, intending to lie in front of the car when the mayor was out on official business and submit her complaint. Therefore, Huang Zicheng has also fled. Thus, the case is gradually expanding.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Xue Die Separates From This Point Onward <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Divorce has been finalized</p>
<p>Retrial of six hundred yuan</p>
<p>Film star Hu Die (Butterfly Wu) initiated divorce proceedings against her fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, due to his unreasonable demand for dissolution of the engagement, deeming it impossible to spend a lifetime together. She engaged lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a suit against Lin, seeking repayment of loans and advances totaling over one thousand yuan. The plaintiff was victorious in both trials. However, Lin remained unconvinced and appealed to the Supreme Court. After reviewing the entire case file in detail, the court deemed the original judgment fair in all aspects except for the six hundred yuan loan, which remained in question. Consequently, the court remanded the entire case file to the Second Branch of the High Court, instructing them to retry the six hundred yuan loan matter. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Hu, along with Assessors Ye and Cai, opened the court to summon witnesses. Neither Hu Die nor Lin Xuehuai personally attended the hearing. However, many people wishing to catch a glimpse of the talented female star arrived at the court in droves, reaching several dozen in number. Upon learning that neither Hu nor Lin would appear, they reluctantly departed. At 2:30 PM, the case was heard. Judge Hu began by announcing to the representatives of both parties that the scope of the current hearing was limited to the six hundred yuan matter, as the other aspects had already been determined. Lin Xuehuai's lawyer, E Sen, stated that regarding the six hundred yuan, in addition to the check, there should be inquiries about other evidence. Hu Die's lawyers, Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang, asserted that the loan had been previously proven by Zhou Jianyun, who testified that Lin borrowed six hundred yuan from Hu, who in turn borrowed a check from the Mingxing Film Company, for the purpose of engaging in the gold business. Hu then delivered the check to Lin for withdrawal from the bank. Therefore, Lin's seal was affixed to the back of the check. Otherwise, as it was a bearer check, why would a seal be necessary? When Hu borrowed from Mingxing, Zhou inquired about the purpose, and Hu informed him that it was being lent to Lin. Therefore, Zhou was aware of it. If the court still required Zhou to testify, he should be subpoenaed. Judge Hu then advised that the case now concerned only a small matter, and both parties should make concessions and reach a settlement. If they insisted on a verdict, it would only prolong the matter. The lawyers for both parties should persuade their clients to resolve the matter peacefully. The court scheduled a hearing for the verdict on the afternoon of the 26th of this month. After the announcement, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Huang Jianliang Accused of Fraudulent Inducement to Marriage and Abandonment <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>He Signed a Contract with Qin Aifang as His Legal Wife</p>
<p>After a Long Time, He Grew Tired of Her and Even Injured Qin Through Assault</p>
<p>Qin Aifang, a woman from Jiading, currently 22 years old, residing at No. 61 Zhoushan Road, worked as a nurse in the medical room of the Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Mill. In 1928, she suddenly became entangled with Huang Jianliang, a Baoshan native working as a supervisor at the Chuangxin Construction Company. They soon began living together. Recently, their relationship suddenly deteriorated, and Huang Jianliang hired lawyers Xie Jingshan and Tang Youwei to sue Qin Aifang in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment to dissolve their "husband-concubine" relationship. The Special Court held a mediation hearing, but it was unsuccessful, so Huang formally filed a lawsuit. At the same time, Qin, seeing that Huang had filed a lawsuit, also hired lawyer Yu Congdao to file a criminal complaint against Huang for fraudulent inducement to marriage and abandonment. Her father, Qin Ding, as her legal guardian, was listed as the plaintiff. The complaint stated that when the plaintiff was 18 years old and of weak will, the defendant initially promised to make Fang his legal wife. On July 2, 1928, the defendant wrote a contract acknowledging her as his legal wife, but repeatedly delayed the marriage. Recently, the defendant grew tired of her, viewing Fang as a thorn in his side. On August 15 of this year, he even used both hands to choke Fang's throat, nearly causing her death. Fortunately, the maid Shen Sannan rescued her, avoiding disaster. He also kicked Fang violently in the waist, causing serious injuries. On September 19, he took away Fang's savings of 300 yuan. Under these circumstances, the defendant has committed crimes under Articles 244, 157, and 310 of the Criminal Code, requesting severe punishment according to the law and ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff (1) 7,500 yuan in alimony, (2) 300 yuan in savings, and (3) 12,000 yuan in compensation. This criminal case was scheduled for a hearing yesterday afternoon. Qin Aifang, dressed in a printed long cheongsam, a woolen short vest, with curled hair and leather shoes, arrived at the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court at 2:00 PM with five or six other women to report. Judge Wu Tingqi then took his seat and summoned the defendant's lawyers, Xie Jingshan and Tang Youwei, who stated that Huang Jianliang could not attend due to illness. They presented the concubine contract signed by Qin and Huang, which was certified by lawyer Yao Xian. They also argued that since the defendant had already filed a civil lawsuit, which was scheduled to be heard tomorrow, according to Article 263 of the Civil Procedure Law, criminal cases should be suspended until the civil case is resolved. Therefore, they requested that the court declare a suspension of this case. Qin Aifang, however, insisted that she was Huang's legal wife, and claimed that the concubine contract presented by the defendant was signed under deception. Judge Wu Tingqi, after consulting, ruled that since both parties were already involved in a civil lawsuit in the Civil Division, the case should proceed after the civil judgment, and this case would be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Lewd Kidnapping of a Girl - Case Involving Moral Corruption <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Court Prohibits Spectators</p>
<p>A Rascal Commits Heinous Acts</p>
<p>Tang A'er, a Yongbo native and a scoundrel, is twenty-one years of age and works as a dockworker. On the afternoon of the ninth of this month, he abducted Gu A'fu, an eleven-year-old girl from the home of Gu Rulin at No. 18 Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession. He first took her to the area of the Great World and the Bund to play. Then, at 3:00 AM that night, he took her to a garbage bin inside Baoxing Lane on Avenue Edward VII, where he forcibly raped her. The next day, he planned to take her elsewhere to sell her. After the girl was kidnapped and went missing, Gu Rulin searched everywhere but could not find her. He reported the matter to the police station, requesting an investigation. The next afternoon (i.e. the tenth), Tang was leading the girl across the Garden Bridge outside the Public Concession when they were seen by Zhou Buying, a friend of the girl's father. Zhou tricked Tang, saying that the girl's father was looking for her and that he would be rewarded if he took the girl home. Tang believed him and went with Zhou to return the girl home. The girl's father immediately detained Tang. The girl then told her father about being kidnapped and raped. The father called police officer No. 65, who took Tang to the police station. After investigation by detective Hang Bingquan, Tang was sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was publicly prosecuted for the crimes of moral corruption and abduction under Articles 240 and 257 of the Criminal Code and was detained. The police sent the girl to Guangci Hospital, where Dr. Bris (transliteration) examined her. The doctor found that although the girl's labia were not severely injured, her hymen had been broken, suggesting that she had been raped several days prior. The doctor issued a medical certificate and submitted it to the police station as evidence. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Xiong Yinping continued the trial at the First Criminal Division. Because the case involved moral corruption, spectators were prohibited, and they were ordered to leave the courtroom. First, the police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, reported on the hospital's examination of the victim and presented the medical certificate. Then, the victim, Gu A'fu, described the circumstances of her abduction and rape. The defendant denied everything. After questioning, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 25th and that the defendant be returned to custody. The plaintiff was ordered to bring the victim to the court's forensic doctor's office for examination tomorrow (today) afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Bank of Communications Narrowly Escapes Robbery of 100,000 Yuan <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Robbers Were Ready</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Police Cracked the Case Beforehand</p>
<p>The Mastermind Was the Bank's Chauffeur</p>
<p>On Double Ten Day morning, Lao Zha Police Chief Inspector You A'gen, detectives Liu Junqing and Zhou Guisheng, Bao Detective Zhang Yi, and Western Detective Chief White, apprehended nine major robbers including Lu Zhenming, Luo A'jin, Lu A'mao, Yang A'da, Li Yuexiang, Wu Zixiang, Wu Juncai, Wang Changlin, and a woman, Wu Zhang, in a room at No. 21 Dachen Hotel on the boundary road, No. 24 Yuxing Lane on Rue Pére Robert, and No. 82 Wangzhi Road. Two Mauser pistols, three handguns, and ninety-three rounds of ammunition were confiscated. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. After investigation by Inspector You and others, it was found that, with the exception of the woman Wu Zhang, who did not participate in the crime, the remaining defendants were planning to rob the Bank of Communications on Beijing Road, which was scheduled to transport 100,000 yuan in cash to the Hangzhou branch the day after their arrest. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Special Court's Criminal Division held a continued trial. Police lawyer Ru Baozi stated that the police were prosecuting them for the crimes of possessing military firearms and robbery under Article 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms and Article 348 of the Criminal Code. However, Wu Zhang had no criminal behavior and should be released to avoid wrongful detention. Judge Feng approved. Lawyer Ru continued that according to bank practice, cash is often transported to other cities or transported to Shanghai from other cities to facilitate circulation. This transportation is done by the bank using cars to transport the cash to the North Railway Station, and then relying on trains to transport it to various places. Each shipment is always more than 100,000 yuan. The Bank of Communications is no exception. The defendant Wang Changlin was a chauffeur at the Bank of Communications six months ago, and the car he drove was No. 10087, which was used to transport large sums of money. Therefore, Wang knows the transportation methods in detail. Later, he was dismissed from the bank due to his bad behavior. Although Wang was dismissed, his old colleagues in the bank were all familiar with him, so he often went to the bank. One day, Wang went to the Bank of Communications garage and chatted with the driver's assistant, Huang Laosan. Inadvertently, he learned that the bank would be transporting a large sum of cash to the Hangzhou branch on the 11th. Wang then told his friend Wu Juncai, and they decided to plot a robbery. However, they did not have enough manpower, so Wu asked Lu Zhenming to recruit Luo A'jin, Lu A'mao, Yang A'da, and Li Yuexiang. They still lacked weapons, so Lu borrowed two Mauser pistols and three handguns from Wu Zixiang. Everything was ready, and they went to Dachen Hotel on the boundary road outside the North Railway Station. Once the No. 10087 car arrived with the money, they would rush forward and rob it at gunpoint. Unexpectedly, the police cracked the case beforehand, avoiding a major disaster. When Wu Juncai was arrested, two train schedules were found on him, raising suspicions. This is the whole story of the case. The court should make a judgment. Afterwards, Western Detective Chief White submitted a report on the investigation of the case. Feng Zhongyi, the representative of the Bank of Communications, stated that the bank usually has a bodyguard to escort the money, but they did not know about the plan in advance until now. Judge Feng, after consulting, interrogated each defendant one by one and ordered them to be returned to custody for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Bureau of Social Affairs' Work Report for the 20th Year <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, Labor, and Charity Sections</p>
<p>The Ri Ri News Agency reports that the Bureau of Social Affairs' work report for the 20th year has been completed and printed. The content is divided into three parts: agriculture, industry, and commerce; labor administration; and public welfare and charity. It describes the social situation of the city in great detail. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce: 1. Regarding agriculture, the number of seedlings planted in nurseries, aged one to four years, totaled 180,914. The Agricultural Experiment Station was charged with selecting seeds for cotton, rice, and wheat, improving crops, and increasing farmers' production to develop the rural economy. Six agricultural cooperation experimental areas were established, each with six farms, each farm covering five mu, totaling 60 farms covering 300 mu. To prevent rice stem borer damage, stations were set up to purchase 680,532 blocks of rice stem borer eggs and 167,402 rice stem borer moths, costing 1,777 yuan, 3 jiao, 1 fen, and 3 li. According to statistics, the total agricultural output of the city included 297,494 dan of rice, 79,392 dan of beans, 45,959 dan of barley, 36,827 dan of naked barley, 205,695 dan of wheat, and 41,430 dan of cotton. A survey of the city's cattle showed 691 water buffalo and 1,494 yellow cattle. A survey of 2,484 villages in the rural areas showed 54,150 households with 263,45 people, including 14,685 owner-farmers, 14,430 part-owner-farmers, 8,573 tenant farmers, and 16,462 farmers engaged in other occupations. (Yangjing, Yinxiang, Hunan, and Zhabei were not included.) Surveys were conducted on 25 bee farms and 6 chicken farms, and an agricultural product exhibition was held. 409 dan of spring fertilizer and cotton seeds were distributed. Investigations into flood damage were conducted, and negotiations with various bureaus were held to reduce taxes. A fishery guidance center was established, and a request was submitted to the central government to abolish fishery taxes and restore fishing rights to prevent Japanese vessels from infringing on fishing grounds. A fishery promotion exhibition was held to promote improvement. Furthermore, nine agricultural associations were approved for registration in nine districts, and eleven fishing boat companies with fourteen fishing boats were registered. 2. Regarding industry, the Bureau's Industrial Experiment Station accepted 311委托 trials of various raw materials from various factories and researched 27 kinds of raw materials. Nineteen entrustment certifications were performed. The Bureau of Weights and Measures promoted the new system and conducted business registrations for 72 manufacturing factories and stores. 115,076 measuring instruments, 1,165 volumetric instruments, and 124,857 weighing instruments were inspected. Regular inspections were subsequently implemented, covering 62 vegetable markets and 3,081 businesses in the French Concession of the North and South districts. In accordance with orders, factory registration was conducted, and 1,889 factories citywide were investigated. Statistics were compiled by category. Industrial products were awarded, including four special industrial awards and 65 exemptions from taxation for machine-made foreign-style goods. Factory inspections were prepared, and factory equipment was planned to ensure worker safety. 3. Regarding commerce, famous brand products were widely displayed in the National Goods Exhibition Hall to promote the concept of loving and using national goods. Certificates were issued to protect goods of certified grade. Fifteen commercial disputes were mediated, and seven cases of trademark infringement were strictly prohibited. Speculative trading on the exchange was banned, and stalls on various roads were reorganized. Surveys of Japanese goods were conducted, coal shortages were addressed, and transportation costs were reduced. Illegal commercial monopolies were banned, and disputes over vegetable market bids were resolved. The accounts of the Communist Development Company were thoroughly investigated, and deposits in the Japan-China Night Bank were pursued. Stores were prohibited from illegally engaging in savings businesses. Surveys of the business conditions of various industries were conducted, and industry regulations were reviewed. Thirty-three industries have been announced, and nine industries have been ordered to submit originals that have not yet been returned. Seven industries have been rejected for non-compliance, and twelve industries are awaiting review. The establishment of 138 public associations was approved. The registration of companies submitted to the Ministry for approval included 126 limited liability companies, 63 unlimited liability companies, 3 partnerships, and 1 limited partnership. The registration of 155 commercial firms, 906 industrial and commercial registrations, and 227 accountant registrations were approved. Nineteen signing certifications were performed. Special business registrations were conducted, including 123 pawnshops. Fourteen cases of pawnshops being robbed in the war zone were handled. In addition, commercial surveys and statistics were conducted, including special business surveys, commodity production and sales surveys, and citywide commercial firm censuses. Some have been completed, and some are still in progress. (1) The special business survey aims to investigate the customs of a specific commercial industry to provide a reference for policy implementation. Completed surveys include the yarn, matches, paper, sugar, soap, flour, and cigarette industries, as well as silver shops. (2) The commodity production and sales survey covers categories, sources, sales channels, transportation, taxes, packaging, buying, selling, stacking, and storage. Surveys of more than 20 industries have been completed. (3) The citywide commercial firm census aims to understand the distribution of various industries, totaling 71,979 companies and firms citywide. (4) An investigation into war damage was conducted. Since the January 28 Incident, countless businesses and residents have suffered direct and indirect losses. A joint office was organized with the City Chamber of Commerce and the Accountants Association to investigate war damage. Preliminary estimates of the losses of the Shanghai War have already been disclosed in various newspapers, and the second stage of estimates and detailed statistics are currently being compiled and will be published upon completion. Commercial statistics (1) Financial statistics were used to observe the relationship between the city's finance and foreign countries, as well as local changes, such as the exchange rate of mark gold, foreign exchange indexes, domestic exchange indexes, and the exchange rate of foreign cents, silver cents, small foreign coins, and copper coins. Statistics on domestic public bonds were subsequently added. (2) Price statistics were used to observe changes in commercial conditions. Statistics on yarn prices and silk prices have now been completed.</p>
<p>Labor Administration: 1. With the promulgation of the Factory Law, the various single labor laws and regulations previously formulated in the city, such as the "Measures for Employee Retirement Benefits," became ineffective. The Bureau formulated the "Provisional Rules for Worker Service," the "Provisional Rules for Worker Treatment," and the "Provisional Rules for Store Clerk Service" and submitted them to the mayor for approval and implementation as a basis for reference. 2. The compilation of various surveys and statistics continued, such as statistics on strikes and shutdowns, statistics on labor-management disputes, statistics on labor-management disputes, statistics on wages and working hours, and the worker cost of living index. 3. In accordance with the Labor Dispute Resolution Law, labor-management disputes were mediated, and more than 400 cases have been resolved. 4. Labor unions were registered after being reorganized and registered separately in accordance with the law after being organized by the City Party Department. Forty-two industrial unions and thirty-eight trade unions have been registered. 5. Hotel receptionists were registered. This year, 55 hotels employing receptionists applied for registration, and 96 receptionists were approved for registration. 6. Factory inspections were conducted. Special personnel were required to inspect factories. The Bureau recruited qualified factory inspectors in accordance with regulations and sent them to the Industrial Personnel Training Institute of the Ministry of Industry for training before being employed. Inspections began in July of the 20th year. Of the more than 900 factories in the city, excluding the Special Zone, about 347 were subject to the Factory Law. 7. During the January 28 Incident this year, the number of unemployed workers increased several times over. The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Public Security Bureau, together with various public welfare organizations, organized the War Zone Unemployed Workers Relief Association, registered more than 20,000 workers, and introduced them to jobs and provided rice relief. Other facilities were planned but could not be realized due to limited funding. It is regrettable that nothing could be accomplished in terms of worker welfare.</p>
<p>Public Welfare and Charity: 1. For the sake of rectifying the city appearance, maintaining public order, and public health, the city decided to eliminate shantytowns and build public housing at the same time. The First Residence was established on Quanjia'an Road, the Second Residence was established on Xietu Road, and the Third Public Residence was expanded on Wenlu Road, totaling more than 300 rooms. The Fourth Public Residence is currently being built. 2. Although the Bureau's poverty alleviation fund was only 40,000 yuan, the amount borrowed in the 20th year reached more than 130,000 yuan, which greatly benefited the livelihoods of the poor. Expansion has been planned repeatedly but has not been realized due to the city's financial constraints. 3. The Bureau has formulated general rules for cooperative societies, including sales, consumption, and purchase cooperatives. Eight cooperative societies were approved for registration this year. 4. During the floods in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces this autumn, the city established a Disaster Relief Committee, which was managed by the Bureau. A refugee camp was built on Liuying Road, accommodating more than 6,000 refugees. 5. This year, the Bureau directly assisted in the repatriation of 7,201 refugees (not war zone refugees), 202 unemployed workers from the Shenyang Arsenal, 3 Chinese workers returning from France, and 366 veterans. Temporary relief was provided, such as sending the poor back to their hometowns, providing medical treatment, clothing, and coffins, totaling 1,296 people. 6. Social organizations in the city were originally divided into charity, religious, women's, and social categories. Later, due to the election of the National Assembly and the dissolution of trade unions, organizations such as the Lianyi Society and Lianshan Society, which were related to free professional organizations and the reorganization of trade unions, were also managed in accordance with the Regulations for the Supervision of Social Organizations. Since January of this year, forty-one have been registered, and twenty-one have been filed. Those that have not been approved by the City Party Department and have not been proven to be well-organized have been ordered to follow the procedures. Those that have not been approved and have solicited donations without permission or have achieved no results have been ordered to dissolve or immediately shut down. 7. There are many charitable organizations in the city, and their assets have never been audited. This year, the Charitable Organization Property Reorganization Committee was established and managed by the Bureau. It has reorganized 2,167 mu, 3 fen, 4 li, and 8 hao of farmland in the urban area and 7,026 mu, 2 fen, 5 li, and 9 hao of farmland outside the city, with an estimated total value of more than 13.69 million yuan. Methods for improving the use of these properties have been proposed separately. It is estimated that after reorganization, the original revenue will increase by more than 360,000 yuan. A unified management plan has been proposed, but unfortunately, the September 18 Incident occurred, and the nation suffered a great disaster. Due to various reasons, it had to be temporarily suspended and is still waiting to be planned and implemented.</p>

However, due to the excessive cost of the magazine and its low price, it was originally planned to increase the price immediately. However, readers from other places have sent letters requesting an extension. Therefore, in the spirit of hard work and self-sacrifice, the magazine has revised the preferential subscription methods. Anyone who subscribes to the entire year directly from the Wansui Bookstore at No. 279 Wangping Street, Sima Road, Shanghai, before the end of the Gregorian calendar October, will only be charged 5 yuan (plus 6 jiao for postage, 2 yuan and 8 jiao for half a year, and 3 jiao for postage).

<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I recently saw an article in your newspaper about a dispute involving dancers. It does not correspond with the facts and is likely based on rumors spread by malicious people or a mistake by a reporter. On that day, dancers Wang Yingying and Qian Baoying had a verbal argument in the dance hall. Deng Baoshan, the dance hall manager, fearing it would affect the hall's business, removed both of them from the dance floor to a small room. However, they continued to argue noisily. The European manager, Adason, along with the Russian police officer, tried to mediate without success. Qian Baoying was then pushed out the back door, while Wang Yingying fiercely chased after her. The hall immediately closed the back door to avoid further trouble. This is what actually happened at the time. I respectfully request that you make a correction as soon as possible. Sincerely, The Jiuxing Dance Hall, October 18, 21st year.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the news column in your paper of the 18th, which published an article titled "Concubine Fears Cohabitation with Wife," I was shocked that it mentioned my name. I have been called Ding Yong, with the style name Dingrong, and have no other aliases, nor have I ever taken a wife, and am shocked that such an incident would implicate me. This proves that the article must be a mistake in the submission. I hope that you will make a correction immediately and please publish this letter in the Letter to the Editor column. Sincerely, Chen Dingyong, October 18th.</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Story of the Prodigal Son <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Ji</p>
<p>Elder Ma said: "The story of the prodigal son, from the Gospel of Luke, is truly a wonderful article!"</p>
<p>"Just look at that old father, seeing the prodigal son return: what enthusiasm! What sentiment!"</p>
<p>"That young prodigal son, insisted on dividing the family: got his inheritance, squandered it all! He could only herd pigs for others, not even getting what the pigs ate. So he changed his mind and said:"</p>
<p>"In my father's house, so many servants have plenty of food and rice: am I really going to starve to death here? I will arise and go to my father, and say to him: Father! I have sinned against heaven and against you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Please treat me as one of your servants!"</p>
<p>"Since the prodigal son has changed his mind in this way, he got up and put it into practice! This is precisely the state of a sinner's repentance. That white-haired father, still far away, was moved with compassion and went to meet him!"</p>
<p>Elder Ma then said that in this story, the father ordered the servants to dress the returning son in fine robes, give him a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: this indicates the restoration of his [Lord]'s status: this is also according to the Jewish customs of the time.</p>
<p>This led to a mention of the famous theological work translated by Elder Ma about twenty years ago: "A Straight Explanation of the Newly Combined History." Elder Ma also recalled what his teacher told him, saying:</p>
<p>"The author of this book compiled it in prison, based on memorization, and was able to read the Bible so thoroughly that he combined the"</p>
<p>"Four Gospels, without omitting even one useful [and] (that is, the Latin et) word! This person, called Fei Landi, truly deserves our admiration!"</p>
<p>Elder Ma also said: "To read the Bible well, one should learn ancient languages such as Hebrew, Greek, and Latin."</p>
<p>[Note] Elder Ma translated the twenty volumes of "A Straight Explanation of the Newly Combined History," published by the Tushanwan Printing House in Shanghai in 1913.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Gun is Aimed Wrongly <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>| Soldiers Brave in Internal Wars, Please Wake Up |</p>
<p>When I was young, I heard a joke: There was an old scholar in a village, very famous for his writing skills. Coincidentally, someone in the village's mother-in-law died, so they asked the old scholar to write a eulogy. Who knew that he had rummaged through all his treasures, | books for writing formal essays | but he only had eulogies for fathers-in-law, not mothers-in-law, so he copied the eulogy without changing a single word and gave it to this person. A few days later, this person said to the scholar: "The eulogy you wrote, sir, I am afraid it is wrong!" He angrily said: "This eulogy can be verified against the ancient texts, and is indeed correct to the last word. Could it be that they died the wrong person in his family!"</p>
<p>Now, the guns of our country's soldiers are just like the old scholar's articles. It's not that they are not doing well, it's that they are aiming at the wrong people!</p>
<p>Who says that the Chinese military is not brave? They fight each other, falling forward and following after, treating death as going home.</p>
<p>Who says that our armaments are dilapidated? In recent domestic wars, airplanes and cannons have also been available. It is a pity that the direction is not accurate, but the gun is aimed at the wrong people!</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, General Weng Zhaoyuan of the 19th Route Army said to his subordinates: "The powerful enemy is pressing us, and we cannot endure it any longer! We can only fight to the death to find life from death. If our cannons are destroyed, we can use long guns. If we run out of bullets, we can use bayonets. If the bayonets break, use your fists and feet. Finally, you still have your teeth to bite the enemy." These words truly spoke of loyalty and courage, able to move ghosts and spirits, and move heaven and earth. Why? Because this is a vow to resist foreign aggression!</p>
<p>Every time a civil war breaks out, the telegrams from each warlord always say: "Even if one soldier and one bullet remain, we will definitely fight to the end." Although these two sentences are also brave and intense, when our people hear them, they always feel a little dizzy, because no matter how strong you compete to be a hero, you are always family!</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the only times the guns were aimed outward in the past were the Battle of Manzhouli and the Battle of Zhabei. The rising forces are the volunteer armies in the White Mountains and Black Waters. Alas! What a pity! How shameful! The roar of cannons and the crackling of gunfire for the past twenty years have all been directed inward!</p>

<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>When will the singing and dancing by West Lake end? Beyond the mountains, green mountains; beyond the building, more buildings. It was once a place of hardship in the past. The joys and sorrows of ten thousand families are in my heart. I thought I was stealing time to learn like a young man. You must know that hard work is the family tradition. Judges have always had little patience. The most important fame is not money.</p>
<h3 id="e181">What I Know About [Today's Mulan] <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Mu</p>
<p>| Poisoned by an Inheritance |</p>
<p>Because of keeping a secret for a trusted friend, I have kept this secret in my stomach for almost a year. What I know about [Today's Mulan] - Ms. Wang Kangfu - is more detailed than what [Yun Sun] knows: To understand Ms. Wang's past situation, one must start with her family history.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang is from Zhejiang. Her father was a Doctor of Literature from Columbia University in the United States and served as a professor at a certain university in Japan. Ms. Wang grew up in Japan and graduated from a Japanese high school, so she has a solid foundation in Japanese. Unfortunately, her father died. She had no brothers, and few sisters. Her mother, also an artist, treated Ms. Wang as if she were a pearl in her hand. Considering the entire estate, she was unwilling to give it all away to her nephews and nieces for nothing. When she took her orphan daughter back to China, she instructed Ms. Wang to dress as a man, change her name to [Kangfu], and pass herself off as a man. This was not a matter of a day or two. After returning to China, she first entered a high school attached to a certain university in western Shanghai, and now she has graduated. Ms. Wang is quiet and taciturn, never changing her maidenly appearance. She is amiable and approachable to her friends. Especially, she is uniquely blessed with a smart brain. Since graduating from the high school and university, she has never ranked below third place. She also studied both arts and sciences at the same time. Recently, she has been specializing in German and plans to go to Germany for further studies. Her joining the Boy Scouts was to volunteer for translation work in English, Japanese, and German, but unexpectedly, she was assigned to the Transportation Department for further study. Her joining the Boy Scouts was to volunteer for translation work in English, Japanese, and German, but unexpectedly, she was assigned to the Transportation Department, which was not Ms. Wang's original intention. However, she did not consider other plans in service to the country. Later, she quietly returned to Shanghai because her secret was discovered by a colleague, who used it as blackmail. She left with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang is talented in literature. Her works are scattered in the Short Story Monthly and other general monthly publications. Her novels and translations have a considerable place in literature. The names [Kangfu], [Wanman], and [Sydney] are her works. She is a devout Christian and prays sincerely before every meal. On Sundays, she is often seen at Moore Memorial Church.</p>
<p>I hereby declare: As far as I know, Ms. Wang has not lived with anyone, |although she has a lover|. She is currently teaching at a certain charity organization in a town west of Shanghai because she has hemoptysis and is too weak to go abroad immediately.</p>

<p>— Xie Lu</p>
<p>| Sketches of Urban and Rural Life |</p>
<p>In the sweltering summer, getting up at six o'clock in the morning, washing your face, and eating some snacks is already seven o'clock. At this time, there are still few pedestrians on the streets of S City. The glutinous rice stalls, dumpling stalls, and beef vermicelli stalls at the entrances of the alleys are crowded with people, wolfing down food and desperately filling their stomachs, paying the money, and hurrying to work.</p>
<p>HL Sheng entered the office, already a quarter past eight. Colleagues arrive one after another, and LH Sheng begins to work. Because the room is as small as a den, and the air is stifling, he sweats like rain. After completing a day's work, it is already past five o'clock. After showering and eating, he does another two or three hours of writing labor. Just as he is about to go to bed, the sounds of the neighbors' erhu, flute, guessing games, and flirting and scolding, and a man tightening his throat, [Intimate Guest], [Ten Farewells], [Crying Seven Seven], singing very lively, making noise until about one o'clock. It turns into an Italian lullaby, sending the tossing and turning LH Sheng to sleep.</p>
<p>At about four o'clock, Grandpa Toiler pushes his rumbling night soil cart, making a bamboo-splitting sound with his voice: "Empty the chamber pots! Empty the chamber pots!" Following the loud knocking on the iron door, the screaming of Grandpa and Grandma Toiler, LH Sheng wakes up and cannot fall asleep. The sky is already turning fish-belly white. He gets up in a rush, and the bedbugs are still crawling on his legs, itching unbearably. Alas! LH Sheng lives this kind of life every day.</p>
<p>In the autumn, when gold is paved on the ground, men and women, old and young, in the countryside are most happy and hardworking. In the dim dawn, women cook and men cut rice. Children stack grass, dry grain, and old people pound rice, and carry firewood. No one is not working with joy on their faces. When the setting sun gradually enters the west mountain, those carrying baskets, carrying grain, carrying firewood, driving cattle and sheep, and letting chickens and ducks out, each return home. After drinking wine and eating their fill, they fall into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>On the day LH Sheng returned to his hometown for the Mid-Autumn Festival, the neighbors were busy harvesting. The neighborly friendship of the villagers is very different from that of the people in S City. The old man from the neighboring family was very excited and caught a chicken from the fence to kill and cook. He cooked freshly cut rice and poured self-brewed wine, eagerly urging his guest to drink. Du Fu's poem says: "The market is far from the plate, so there are no double flavors; the family is poor, so there is only old home-brewed wine in the jug." The countryside is full of natural charm. How can the city compare? So LH Sheng drank the neighbor's wine and fell soundly asleep, not appreciating the moonlit night.</p>
<p>[Entering Customs with Postal Friends (16)]</p>
<p>—Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Also, there was Lu Danian's English night school. In this period of uncertainty and shock, the Japanese hated intellectuals the most. Some fled, some died. Not only did Tong Yizhen not come to class anymore, but the rest of the students also dragged their feet and disappeared. The door was closed. In the winter, Lu Danian, in accordance with the ancient sage's teaching of "do not live in a dangerous country," and because the school where he held a teaching position was also closed, decided to move to a better place. He hastily ended the family school and took his family to flee to the mainland. Before leaving, he had said to Boqin:</p>
<p>"Why don't you come with me, brother? I have a friend who runs a school in Beiping and has written to me to arrange a teaching position. After you arrive, perhaps you can ask him to find a small clerk position in the school for you. The postal service here is originally good, but it seems that you shouldn't give it up so easily. But according to my observation, the Japanese will not let go of this postal authority so easily. There will soon be a change, and I am afraid that your small position will be difficult to maintain. Moreover, it is too dangerous for you to squat here alone, and I am very worried. If you can leave, it is better to leave early."</p>
<p>But Lu Boqin refused to leave. The biggest reason was that he could not leave his lover in this time of crisis and only care about his own safety. There was also a second reason, which was that he should be loyal to his duties. None of his colleagues in the post office had left, so how could he be so cowardly? However, the biggest reason was too embarrassing to say, and he only expressed the second reason as much as possible.</p>
<p>At the end, he added some of the most impassioned sentences: "The post office is the only remaining national official institution of the Republic of China that can still exercise its powers in this place! Colleagues in the bureau are working together with one heart and mind, regarding life and death as one, and are determined to support this remaining situation. To show the fearless true spirit of our Chinese nation's patriotism and dedication to public service, and refusal to succumb to bullies, no one can desert their posts until the last bit of strength is exhausted. How can I be so despicable as to bring shame to the whole country, the whole nation, and all my colleagues in the post office? Brother! Please go, I am determined to dedicate my whole life to the post office and my sacred duty to which I have dedicated myself! You don't need to plan everything for me anymore!"</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market situation turned weak again. Because American cotton was trending lower, people's attitudes softened slightly. However, the actual demand for Cantonese purchases was still strong. The near-term situation was more expensive, but sellers were actively selling, and most people in the market were taking a small view. However, the bulls at Wing On were still struggling hard.</p>

<p>The cotton market followed American cotton downward. People's attitudes were weak, and it was rumored that Shenxin Factory was continuing to sell at a discount, so the near-term situation was weak again. However, the general retail investors were unwilling to let go of the prices of various producing areas. They were unwilling to sell for prices above 31 taels. However, a certain manufacturer was firmly bearish. However, the poor performance of the foreign cotton market would have a great impact.</p>

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the source from various gangs was scarce. The stock in the river bank was low. The attitude of the shops was that the prices rose less and fell more during the transition period between crops, so the appetite was sluggish. Local species, hundreds of thousands of sacks of Early Rice, Red Rice, and other goods were all fixed. Yang Du Jian bid up the price by a jiao or so. Xinzha: Yesterday, because ships could not pass through the Yejidun area, more than 100 households along the Suzhou River, the sales in the street in the morning were not very active. Changshu: The new goods and Qingjiao kiln seed sold 3 jiao. Baige Rice and Mai Du Jian were continuously purchased, and the market price increased by 1-2 jiao again. The total transaction volume was 4,000-5,000 shi.</p>

<p>| Local and out-of-town merchants have both made inquiries |</p>

<p>Yesterday, because the rice boat downstream was hijacked by the Tongli, most of the ships were rerouted to other ports, and only a few took a detour to Shen, which caused them to be delayed on the way, and the number of goods arriving was low, and the price was rising. Therefore, most people paid attention to the Ningbo Kexian of the train cargo, and foreign rice was also one of the focuses of the street. Yesterday, 3,000 sacks of foreign rice of various colors were traded, and Saigon accounted for half, about 1,400 sacks, more than 1,000 sacks of small grain, more than 100 sacks of Siamese rice, and more than 300 sacks of No. 2 Saigon. Among them, except for 400 sacks of Tianjin to buy and sell small grain, they were all handled by this street, and the market price rose by about 1 jiao compared with the previous day. One Saigon 9 yuan 1 jiao 2 to 2 jiao and a half, No. 2 Saigon 7 yuan 7 jiao, small grain 7 yuan 6 jiao and a half to 7 jiao and a half, and selected Shanghai rice 9 yuan and 1 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was deteriorating due to the realization of foreign wheat transactions. The market price was decreasing. After Kangding and other places bought foreign wheat, they all sold the futures flour in the exchange. Although there were real sales and short covering, the market price was not easy to maintain. In addition, the sales in recent months have been stagnant, and there is a large batch of 450,000 tons of American wheat to be purchased on credit. The future trend of the flour market can be predicted to be bad. Yesterday, the spot sales were stagnant, and the customers withdrew some recent spot, but each factory sold more than 200,000 sacks of futures flour, so the price immediately dropped after the market closed. The first two sessions in the afternoon were especially weak. Later, some shorts covered their positions, and the price stabilized slightly. The closing price was one cent smaller for October, and one and a half cents smaller for November and December. One cent smaller for January, and 2.25 cents smaller for February and March.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month fell step by step. The falling wind was even stronger in the afternoon. The prices for each far-term month were as small as 89%, and the current month was because of the spot driving up the market, the market price did not change greatly when the market opened in the morning, and then due to the news that two ships of Australian white wheat were traded at 3 taels and 70 mace, the market was greatly influenced, and the customers selling short and the shorts increased their positions, the longs came out. The market price went down, and the closing price was 30 mace for this month, 80 mace for the next month, 80 mace for December to February, 50 mace for March. The sales of spot wheat in the factory were still active, and 1,800 sacks were opened, and the price was similar to the previous day. The factory price of rice was 34 mace and the price of high wheat of Jiangbei Liuhe and other places was 33 mace 45% to 30 mace, and the price was close to the market price of the day.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Recently, among my relatives and friends, there have been three young people who committed suicide. One was surnamed Lei, one was surnamed Cai, and one was surnamed Huang. The reasons for their suicides, needless to say, were the result of the two problems of marriage and economy. I don't have many relatives and friends, but within a few days, I found three of them. The number of young people who commit suicide in society every day is undoubtedly countless. However, this kind of extremely evil and cruel situation can naturally be mostly attributed to the extreme expansion of [erotomania] and [desire for life]. Young people are unfortunately born in this chaotic, complex, and depleted social state. All the needs of life cannot be solved by the government and society, nor can they be solved by the family and older brothers. Everything must be struggled for and solved by the young people themselves. During youth, the most difficult hurdle to break through is the word [erotomania]. However, [erotomania] and [desire for life] are indeed closely linked because a happy family requires a happy economy to maintain it. In other words, without a happy economy, not only will there be no happiness and joy in the family, but it will increase suffering. Because [erotomania] will inevitably increase unnecessary needs in terms of material things and feel unnecessary stimulation in terms of spirit. Therefore, both spirit and economy feel severe and urgent pain.</p>
<p>[Men are made of mud, and women are made of water.] Only the [erotomaniac] Jia Baoyu can say this. In fact, from another perspective, one might also say, [Men are made of water, and women are made of mud.] The fluctuation of sexual desire is probably not very different between men and women. However, the nature of love is mostly fluid rather than fixed. Under certain circumstances, desire may change from passionate to indifferent, and from indifferent to hatred. Just look at murdering one's husband! Abandoning one's wife! Running away with embezzled funds! Newspapers occupy an unknown number of pages every day. Several lawyers are exhausted and their feet don't touch the ground. This situation, on the one hand, is enough to prove that a happy family requires a happy economy to maintain it. On the other hand, it can indeed be seen that the nature of love is definitely not a fixed thing. [The neighbor's wife is always better.] I'm afraid the husband also thinks so.</p>
<p>When they were in the heat of passion, they made [oaths of eternal love, swearing to heaven], [to share the same quilt in life and the same grave in death]. They saw many romantic stories in novels, how disgusting! Now, please ask the parties involved in several divorce cases, which one of them was not baptized by the river of love at the beginning? But what about now? Therefore, the young people of today need to understand this point clearly and see it clearly, and naturally they will save themselves a lot of trouble and a lot of depression. It's not because this old man has a yellow-faced old woman that he's saying such cool words. When I was fourteen years old, my father (when my mother had already passed away) had to arrange a marriage for me because of his responsibilities (what was called responsibility in the past is not responsibility now). I strongly opposed it. The reason for my opposition was naturally that I couldn't maintain my personal life, so how could I maintain a family life? As a result, because of the environmental conditions at the time, I finally succumbed and became a couple with her. Since then, we cried together in a ragged quilt, smelling the aroma of the neighbor's rice, suffering all the pain of life's oppression, and getting no comfort or happiness in body and mind. Thinking of this situation even now, I still shudder.</p>
<p>There used to be a saying, [With a wife, all things are sufficient; without debt, one is carefree.] Now I want to turn it around and say, [Without a wife, all things are sufficient; with debt, there is no need to worry.] Because personal life is always easy to maintain, no matter what. If there is a family, then eldest, second, third, and fourth children pour out of the basket and turn out the chest. That's really not easy to maintain. I once heard such a joke:</p>
<p>A certain villain died and went to see Yama. Yama was furious and wanted to sentence him to be reincarnated as a pig. The judge said, "That's too light. It's better to sentence him to be a scholar." Yama was surprised and said, "Is this kind of villain still worthy of being a scholar? Which is the lesser crime, a scholar or a pig?" The judge said, "It's not like that. Pigs usually enjoy themselves very much, and when they die, it's just a knife. If you sentence him to be a scholar and punish him to have seven or eight children, that's endless suffering."</p>
<p>This story is absurd, but it makes sense. Now, the problem of people's livelihoods has spread all over the world. Therefore, countries in the East and West put the marriage problem at the back of their minds and struggle with life first. They probably won't get married until the time when the ancients said, [At thirty, one is strong and has a family]. If they are communists, they despise love even more. Friends are husbands and wives, and husbands and wives are friends, especially as exceptions. It seems that being a scholar is always terrible. Fortunately, in the current era, there are many ways to approach the marriage problem:</p>
<p>One, free marriage.</p>
<p>Two, unfree marriage.</p>
<p>Three, free but unmarried.</p>
<p>Four, unfree and unmarried.</p>
<p>The conditions for marriage now are not as strict as they used to be. There are many paths to find. Just look at the abilities and temperaments of both parties and decide on their plans. If you completely sacrifice the young people like flowers in the waves of love, it's really not worth it. If the young people really have a spirit of sacrifice, then in the current era, places worth sacrificing can be found everywhere. If you want to sacrifice for the country, then join the army and become a volunteer soldier. You can go to the front to kill enemies for the country, which is worthwhile. If you want to sacrifice for yourself, then in the study and laboratory, you can cut a bloody path in terms of knowledge, which is worthwhile. If you want to sacrifice for society, then there are many undertakings in society. As long as you have a clear mind and understand things, there is plenty of room for you to sacrifice. However, love is definitely not a place for you young people to sacrifice.</p>

<h3 id="e204">How to Install a Pump <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Quan</p>
<p>The usual method of raising water is either by using a waterwheel or by drawing it with a wooden bucket. But these two kinds of equipment cannot draw water from low places. If we want to draw water from low places, we must install a pump. Because a pump can not only draw water from low places, but it is also more convenient than wooden buckets and waterwheels.</p>
<p>Pumps are divided into two types: [suction pumps] and [pressure pumps]:</p>
<p>(1) Installation of a suction pump: Use a round cylinder, install a piston in the cylinder, and connect it to a long handle that extends out of the cylinder. Install a long pipe under the cylinder, called the suction pipe. In other words, it is the path for water to enter. Install a curved pipe on the upper side of the cylinder, called the spray pipe. In other words, it is the path for water to exit. Install an upward-opening valve where the suction pipe connects to the cylinder and in the middle of the piston. After preparing in this way, insert the suction pipe into the water, and then lift the handle of the piston upwards. The air in the cylinder becomes thin, and the pressure decreases. The valve above the piston closes, and the water outside the suction pipe is subjected to the pressure of the outside air. It rises through the suction pipe, pushes open the valve, and enters the cylinder. If you press down the piston again, the valve above the suction pipe closes, and the water in the cylinder cannot flow out of the suction pipe. It pushes open the valve above the piston, and the trousers change. It rises to the piston. When the piston is raised again, the valve on the piston closes again, and the water in the cylinder rises with the piston and is sprayed out from the spray pipe. At the same time, the water outside the suction pipe rises from the suction pipe again, pushes open the valve, and rises into the cylinder. As the piston moves up and down in this way, the water outside the suction pipe is continuously sprayed out from the spray pipe, so it is called a [suction pump].</p>
<p>(2) Installation of a pressure pump: Also use a round cylinder. The suction pipe and the valve on the suction pipe are the same as those of the suction pump. However, the water jet pipe should be installed next to the lower part of the cylinder. A valve that opens outward is installed in the water jet pipe. No additional valve is installed in the middle of the piston. When the piston is lifted, the air in the cylinder becomes thin, and the pressure decreases. The valve near the spray pipe and the cylinder closes, and the water outside the suction pipe is subjected to the pressure of the outside atmosphere. It rises through the suction pipe, pushes open the valve, and rises into the cylinder. If you press down the piston again, the valve above the suction pipe closes, and the water in the cylinder cannot flow out of the suction pipe. It pushes open the valve near the spray pipe and the cylinder and is sprayed out from the spray pipe. This is the opposite of the [suction pump], so it is called the [pressure pump].</p>

<h3 id="e206">My Opinion on Abolishing Funeral Objects <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Do ghosts really exist, or do they not exist? Although science in European and American countries is becoming more and more prosperous, there is still no correct proof of whether ghosts exist or not. Just take the complete loss of consciousness when people are sleeping. There is not much difference between sleep and death, which proves that there are no so-called ghosts after death. This point is still more reasonable. However, most people now believe that ghosts exist. When there is a patient in the family, they go to seek help from gods and divination and worship ghosts and gods. As for when a person dies, tin foil, funeral objects, and funeral items are especially indispensable. Regardless of the size of the family, a lot will always be burned.</p>
<p>In our hometown, wealthy families spend tens to hundreds of yuan on tin foil for sacrifices in a year. Even ordinary families need about ten yuan, and the poorest families cannot do without one or two yuan. Therefore, the amount of tin foil needed for sacrifices every year is really countless, and countless amounts of money are wasted unnecessarily every year, which is a pity. As for the funeral objects and funeral items, including tin foil, when a person dies in the family, the cost is even more than that!</p>
<p>We still dare not say for sure whether ghosts exist or not. It is even more vague whether these things are useful after being burned. Let's take a step back and assume that ghosts exist. What use are these things after they are burned to ashes? Moreover, if ghosts really exist, we can definitely conclude that ghosts are just like humans, able to manufacture things and invent objects. They don't need people to supply them. Just like humans, they don't bring anything except their bodies when they are born. Everything must be manufactured by themselves. From this perspective, the uselessness of funeral objects, funeral items, and tin foil is even more conceivable.</p>
<p>In short, the degree of superstition among Chinese people is really too deep. Because the degree of superstition is too deep, there are always some people who take advantage of this superstitious psychology to manufacture various funeral objects and funeral items one after another, deceiving themselves and others. What is especially laughable is that recently, there have been ghost banknotes printed, and some people buy them to burn. May I ask, if a piece of paper is printed with a few words, can the ghost use it as a banknote? Where is the Underworld Bank and the Underworld Fung Bank located? Are they opened by humans or ghosts? Can ghosts cash them out?</p>
<p>Isn't it really too pointless? When a person dies in the family, they make paper clothes and paper utensils for him. Are these things wearable and usable after they are burned? They also regard the thin tin on the paper as silver for ghosts. It is really too ridiculous and pointless for Chinese people, isn't it? However, if we calculate the total amount of money spent on all funeral items, funeral objects, and tin foil in China every year, I'm afraid it's impossible to estimate!</p>
<p>What is the economic situation of Chinese people today? Are they in a state of extreme panic? But they spend so much money on ghosts without showing any reluctance.</p>
<p>How can people not admire such generosity? However, this kind of money is spent too pointlessly and uselessly. There are so many things in China waiting for us to build. If we can use this useful money to do some practical work, wouldn't it be beneficial to the country and the people? In short, China is in such a dangerous situation, and the economic situation is like this. All pointless consumption should be abolished.</p>
<p>If we want to abolish funeral objects and funeral items, this work must be taken up by us young people. We must go to various places to promote the theory that there are no ghosts, or even take a step back and firmly say that funeral objects and funeral items are pointless and useless. At the same time, we also hope that the government can prohibit the opening of funeral object stores. Both sides should proceed at the same time to break the superstitious psychology of the people and save unnecessary consumption. However, the people's degree of superstition is deeply rooted and must be worked hard by us!</p>

<p>Ai Hua walked home, shouting, "Dad, I'm here! Where's Mom?" "Ah, Yu, Ai Hua. You're here? Your mother went shopping." Ai Hua sat down on the chair next to her father and said, "Dad, how are Dad and Mom after I left home?"</p>
<p>"Dad is fine, and Mom is fine. Ai Hua, the night you got married, your mother and I shed so many tears. When you were at home, you would call out, 'Dad! Mom!' all the time. How much we cherished you! How much we loved you! We were even happier when you graduated. Now that you're married, it feels desolate. We miss you so much. When you get there, you'll be unfamiliar. I wonder if you're doing well? Auntie, go get some snacks." "Ai Hua's dad, don't go get snacks. I can't eat anything."</p>
<p>"Dad, Ai Hua, why can't you eat anything?" Ai Hua said she couldn't eat anything, and a matter welled up in her heart. She started to sob. "Ai Hua, what's wrong? Tell me. What's wrong? Tell me quickly!" Ai Hua: "Your mother-in-law doesn't cherish you. Is that right?" Ai Hua cried and said no... "Your husband doesn't share your feelings, is that right?" Ai Hua: "Yes. He came to my place for a walk those first two days, but he hasn't come since. He goes to dance halls and movie theaters day and night, and he's also with a prostitute in (Small Garden). I don't know what her name is. Oh, Yingmei. They're inseparable." After saying that, she cried even harder. When Dad heard Ai Hua's words, he felt sorry for his beloved daughter and also shed tears. Mom came back after buying things. As soon as she got home, she saw Ai Hua sobbing and couldn't help but be surprised! "Ai Hua! Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>When Ai Hua heard her mother asking, she called out "Mom!" and cried again.</p>
<p>"Tell Mom, and Mom will make a decision for you."</p>
<p>Ai Hua was still crying and not saying anything. Dad sighed and told Ai Hua's story. Mom listened and said angrily, "Oh, old man, old man, you're not good. You're not good! I told you to discuss it slowly. I only have one beloved daughter. I spoiled her too much. You didn't listen to me. You decided everything on your own. Now that it's come to this, doesn't it break my heart?" Dad: "Oh, the die is cast. Don't blame me. I already regret it more than (eating ocher). (It's like a mute eating coptis chinensis). I can't express the bitterness. You're not good either. Why don't we discuss a solution?"</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Intention of the Drunken Old Man <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>In a small room, there were hundreds of people crowded together.</p>
<p>It was so crowded that water couldn't leak through, and the air was extremely tense. People couldn't even breathe. But even though the air was so tense and dirty, this group of people, being in it, not only didn't feel any discomfort in their bodies and minds, but on the contrary, they felt a kind of unspeakable pleasure. The eyes of the whole group were focused on the thing that made them so happy, fixedly staring without letting go for a moment. Only the sound of "My dear brother, I'm going to the green gauze tent with you..." was heard. Then the whole group burst into a burst of "hahaha..." laughter, which quickly followed this obscene song and suddenly spread fully throughout the small room. It turned out that a storytelling master had recently come to XX Tea House, singing the most attractive (Karma Record), and also brought a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl to sing small tunes and miscellaneous melodies in between. Originally, no women had ever performed in A Town. This time, such a young girl came, and the frivolous young men in the town were already buzzing with excitement. They all squeezed and pushed, running to support the venue day and night, rain or shine. The storytelling venue was always full, and the teahouse owner was three times as profitable, smiling and busy welcoming and seeing people off.</p>
<p>Tonight, (Karma Record) came to an end. As usual, the girl offered a small tune. Her clear and delicate voice sang that (Dear brother...), which moved the group of young men to dance and stomp their feet, happy beyond words. After the small tune was finished, the venue owner took a playbill to each of the young masters and respectfully asked them to order a song. Then Zhang San ordered a (Eighteen Touches), Li Si ordered a (Diaolius's Four Questions), and Wang Wu ordered a (Ten Mile Pavilion). The girl sang and sang, and when she sang the obscene parts, the audience burst into laughter again. The singing started at eight o'clock and lasted until two o'clock in the middle of the night before it ended. When a group of people poured out of the teahouse door, each of their faces seemed to have gained a kind of victory, constantly beaming and smiling, and they were saying, "Tonight, this (Ten Sent Off...) was sung excellently! Oh, it's a pity she's not a character in the play. If she really played that (sister) and called me 'Dear brother' in such an endearing way, how interesting would that be!" Another one continued, "(You hear her, shouting 'Brother, oh brother,' looking up and shouting, 'Brother, oh brother!') When she shouts, a pair of the most enchanting and affectionate eyes keep glancing at me in circles. It can be seen that she is greeting me." A person nicknamed (Little Fan) on the side said, "(Hmph! Shameless. Greet you? When she went offstage, she smiled at me three times affectionately and meaningfully. It seems I'm going to be Tang Bohu after all.)"</p>
<p>Alas! With internal worries and external aggression, the country is about to perish. Our dear compatriots are still living in such a drunken dream, seeking pleasure and enjoyment. They call it listening to books for recreation, but in fact, the intention of the drunken old man is not in the wine. Look at them, when will they wake up? Alas, alas, I'm afraid that by the time you think you want to wake up, you will already be the people of Korea and India.</p>

<p>Xie Wenyi Printing House publishes (Newspaper Clipping Book). At this time of precarious situation, I am concerned about current affairs. I should select and save the important news and world opinion published in newspapers for reference. As for reviews, poems, medical knowledge, common sense, science, foreign talk, novels, and strange news, there are many good structures. There is a need to cut and leave fragments of jade, but if they are scattered and mixed, it is easy to leave out omissions. It is necessary to paste them in a book so that they can be preserved. The (Newspaper Clipping Book) recently published by Xie Wenyi Printing House on Wangping Street, Sanmalu, in this port is specially for the purpose of newspaper. Not only is it convenient to read, but it is also exceptionally beautiful. The binding is strong and the bottom surface is especially thick, so that it can be stored for a long time without damaging the content. The large size is 17 inches wide and 12 inches high, and each book has 100 pages. The special price is only 1.2 yuan. The small size is 14 inches wide and 10 inches high, and only sells for 80 cents. It is also heard that the cover can be engraved with the purchaser's name in gold letters, without additional charges, to show excellence.</p>
