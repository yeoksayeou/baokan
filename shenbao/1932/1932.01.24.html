<h3 id="c35">節縮政策與廉潔政治彬 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>因爲財政萬分艱窘。中央近來决定厲行節縮政策。據南京方面專電。從本月二十一日起。實業鐵道交通外交等部。都根據國務會議决。議厲行減政實行裁撤駢枝機關汰減公務人員三分之一。而且薪俸都按等級減成發給在目前財政枯竭瀕於破産的情勢下。量入爲出。節約緊縮。當然是必要的政策不過今日財政之枯竭。原因甚多。節縮固然是整理財政的一端。然而收效究竟是微乎其微。因爲致使財政枯竭的最大原因。一爲不生産甚且妨礙生産之開支過鉅。最顯著的是軍費佔預算的百分之八十以上。而另一即爲政府之不廉潔。此兩大原因。爲致使我國家財政破産的癥結。今日而欲談整理財政。必先從裁減軍費與建設廉潔政府着手。裁員減政減薪。不過是其小焉者罷了。「明察秋毫之末。而不見與薪。」這種節縮政策。將能收穫些什麽效果呢。</p>
<p>關於不生産甚至妨礙生産的開支之過鉅一點。在此。我們且置之不言。而始就不廉潔一點予以闡述。</p>
<p>今日政府之不廉潔。一般從政者（當然也有不少潔身自好之士。）之貪汚。已成爲不可否認的事實。軍事長官刻扣軍餉。行政長官侵呑公欵。浮報開支。所謂秘密費。所謂活動費。巧立名目。多飽私囊。視國庫如私人的外府。甚且買官　　賄賂公行。在財政機關表現得尤爲顯明。試一翻閱年來政府要人互許陰私的文電。此種黑幕。當即可揭露無遺。</p>
<p>假如從政者都能廉潔自矢。不舞弊分贓。我們要問。即位至部長。每有薪俸亦不過八百元。何能聲色尤馬。揮霍無度。現在的「要人。」大都在租界上有着巍巍高聳的洋房。在外國銀行裏存有鉅欵。這樣的奢侈。這樣的闊綽。僅憑八百元的薪俸。可能行嗎。諺有。云「儉以養廉。」不能儉。我們自無法信其能廉。試間不貪汚。不舞弊。這樣任意揮霍的鉅欵。究竟是從那裏來的呢。</p>
<p>除了直接的貪贓舞弊而外。牟利的手段。更愈出愈多。多數從政者。都利用其優越的地位。得以早知時局轉變的内幕。及其影響金融界的程度。而大做投機生意。如公債交易金子交易等。市價之起跌不定。一方面固然是隨着時局轉變。另一方面也未嘗不是由於投機者的操縱。結果政府蒙受信用上的損失中小商人受累。而政府要人中投機者。却坐嬴厚利。去年美國財務部長因經營商業被控。然而在我國。却可公然行之。而且已成爲從政者合法而必有的「副業。」</p>
<p>因爲政治不淸明。政府不廉潔。所以官僚主義。支配了整個政治組織。一人做官。便一家做官。一族做官親友皆官。其有　幄關係者。則更據要津。列高位。正如「人得道。」雞犬便都可昇天。</p>
<p>從政者是這樣。整個政治組織又是這樣。政治何由而得淸明。財政何由而得整理。减薪有限。而减薪之後。又何莫不可以舞弊彌補。裁員更有限。就令能裁。也不過限於一般無靠山的小職員罷了。而且不能澈底的澄淸政治。徒裁撤人員。使公務人員毫無保障。人都存「五日京兆」的心理。在表面上固然是收得節縮的利益。而在實際上。此一事實給予一般公務人員以心理上不良的反應。流毒更深而且大。</p>
<p>我們認爲今日而欲整理財政。必（一）厲行預算决算制度。預算决算必絶對公開必得人民之認可。（二）取消一切秘密費活動費等名目。（三）各機關會計人員。不能由主管長官直接任命。應由主計處委任。（四）糾正官吏的奢靡生活。嚴防其貪贜舞弊。并限制其經營投機事業。以澄淸政治。建設廉潔的政府。其在他方面。則節省一切不生産的開支。集全力於建設事業。必如此。財政始有整理之望。裁員减薪。不過是其小焉者罷了。我們固然希望政府能明察「秋毫。」但同時更希望其不要忽視了橫在眼前的「與薪。」</p>

<p>多年懸案一旦解决</p>
<p>東特黨局喪權媚日</p>
<p>哈爾濱通信、特區不動産登記問題爲中日間多年相持之懸案、去年十一月杪、哈埠某報忽戰謂相持九年之東特土地租借問題、目下已告結束、在我國方面地畝管理局長發表談話、謂土地問題之解决、早在數年之前、日人之登記、實係對中國主張之容納、而日人方面、則稱問題實於最近始告結束而於外人有利、並謂從今以後、日人可確保哈埠石頭道街一帶之土地所有權、並可於東鐵沿線一帶謀發展、此中眞相局外人自難明瞭、但自來日人對於中國官廳所頒之章程、無不漢視、今在東北被佔以後、突然踴躍換契、此中原因、不難想見、茲請一述此問題發生之經過、</p>
<p>查東省特區即昔日之東鐵附屬地、當東鐵建築之始、鐵道沿線、成以無償佔用官地、或以低價購取民地、範團極廣、於是形成性質略與租借地相等之鐵道附屬地、其後長春以南之長大線轉讓與日本後、尙餘一零五五零、查下齊那、（合一八七六、一七八畝）每年地利收入約有一百萬盧布、此種土地、在中國境内形成、種種的畸形狀况、帝俄政府傾覆後、我國旣收回東鐵沿線行政權、設置東省特區、不能不將此項土地權收回、民國十二年七月、前特區長官朱慶　乃會同濱江鎭守使張煥相、訂定接收東鐵地畝處之辦法、於八月一日實行、收完竣、次日設東省特區地畝管理局、承繼東鐵地畝處之任務、</p>
<p>但其時在哈之久國領事國、見中國權利之收回大爲不滿、紛紛提出抗議、結果竟令東鐵地畝處繼續存在、然其權限則較减少矣、同時中俄會議在北京開幕、俄人對土地問題表示讓步、故地畝管理局之勢力漸增、及中俄奉俄協定成立、中東鐵路成爲純粹商業機關、無本路外之土地權、東鐵地畝處遂爲事實上之消滅、而地畝管理局乃有完全支配東鐵沿線土地之權責、</p>
<p>但其間曾發生民國十三年末之八站問題、焉當時東鐵俄局長伊萬諾夫、以爲八站爲東鐵經營上必須之土地、開始在其地懲收稅項、中國方面、則以在中國俄奉俄協定中、俄人已明明放棄土地權、斷不能承認此事、民衆方面尤有猛烈之示威運動、以督責政府、結果於十四年一月一日、我國政府宣佈特區境内之不動産法規、聲明凡不經地方法院登記的契約、無法律上之効力、因此而外起外領之抗議謂此種規定、有碍外僑不受中國訴訟管轄之權利、日本方面主張尤烈、當時日總領事天羽英二曾以種種方法、謀此項登記辦法之廢除、中國方面、一方以不動産登記非訟訴事件與領判權無與之說、向彼方答覆、一方面地畝管理局長張煥相、乃於十五年十二月十五日發出第五十號佈告、同月二十日發出第五十一號佈告以示事在必行之意、</p>
<p>該二佈告之要點大致爲廢除舊日俄文契約、另行登記、改發中文契約、苟不經過此種手、續則凡轉讓及更名等事、均屬無效、且訂定租照簡章十條、限定不動産之所有者須備左列之義務、㈠遵守中國法律及地方法令、㈡投資目的、限於自用及自己所營之營業、㈢繳納市政稅項、不得有意拖欠、</p>
<p>此種規定、爲世界任何國待遇外國僑民辦法中之最寬大者、但日本及各國領事、仍以爲妨害其條約上之利益、堅欲推翻、因在哈埠無解决之望、乃一方通告僑民、不納租稅、不登記、一方由北京公使團與張作霖政府交涉、（時張在北京組大元帥府、及張失敗出關、皇姑屯變後、又移歸地方辦理、民國十七年九月、日本駐哈總領事更以「無議員不納稅」之說爲日本僑民納市稅之條件、與我國交涉、以選出委員於市會爲前提、以侵入政治範圍、此節日人已完全達到目的、但土地問題仍未解决也、當駐哈日領八木元八去任之時、尙以此爲最大遺憾、</p>
<p>迨日領大橋忠一抵任後、其他各國領事已不復提及此種、土地問題、但日領仍肆力進行不已、及去年九一八事變發生後據日本報載彼曾向日人發表以下之談話、宣佈土地問題的結果、㈠中華民國十四年一月之東省特區不動産登記條例、不施之於日本人、日人所保有之不動産之讓渡契約、不必經由法院、在地畝局聲明可矣、㈡廢除十五年十二月之第五十號及第五十一號佈告、日人衹須經中國方面略作資格之審查、即可保有舊産及接受新産、㈢日本對於向日所不承認之地畝管理局、作事實上的承認、</p>
<p>此種宣言、與中國方面所宣稱者甚不相符、究竟事實如何、不可得知、但日人方面、則以「恭喜發財」相告語、慶祝哈市道裏石頭道街産業權之隱固、蓋日人在石頭道街之不動産甚多（僅東洋拓殖會社一家已有一千餘坪、約合中國三萬四千方尺、也</p>
<p>據日本報載、截至民國二十年十二月二十八日止、日人所持俄文地契、在地畝局中換成中文地契者、凡三十一件、其所有者之分配如次、東洋拓殖公司一九件、北滙電氣公司一件、土地建築公司一件、極東運輸公司一件、東省實業公司一件、三井洋行一件、哈爾濱銀行一件、木上商店一件、正金銀行三件、北滿興業公司二件、合計三十一件、（按東洋拓殖公司在朝鮮及東三省實有土地極多）聞滿鐵方面並擬在石頭道街建一宏大之建築物、爲日人中心機關之用、　凡四層、地下層將設跳舞廳溜冰塲屋内運動塲食堂酒室等合成之大俱樂部、地上層及二樓爲商店及銀行、三四樓爲住屋、此等建築物苟成事實、當能繁榮石頭道街不少、吾人須注意者、日本人旣取得土地權後、法英美意各國必將援例要求、而哈埠土地業權且將盡落於外人之手、其危險爲何如也、（一月十五日）</p>

<p>交涉進行起見、特於下午三時、往市府趨謁、當蒙延、見並發表談話如下、余（吳自稱）此次晋京、對於滬市中日民衆發生惡化情形、僅向中央報告、未作具體商量、至二十一日日本總領事村井倉松、因十八日有日本僧徒五人、在引翔鄕被毆傷事、親來市政府提出之抗議書、現正準備答覆、期答覆内容、現雖未有具體决定、然以日領所提之四項觀之、其一·二·三·三項、大體可以攷慮辦理、其第四項所要求之取締排日運動、解散抗日團體、因該項團體、係由民衆基於自動的愛國的赤誠而組織、衹須其行動在於合理範圍之内、不妨碍地方上之秩序與安寗、政府是不能以政治力量加以壓迫、故日總領事來市府提抗議書時、即已聲明無權取締、然其行動苟有越出軌道之外、足以妨碍地方秩序安寗等之不合法情形發現、則市政府必依法制裁云、現該項答覆、業已定於下星期一（二十五日）送達日本總領事、</p>
<p>日領尙未答覆惟我方二十二日所提之抗議書、迄至今晚、（廿三日）未有接到覆文、但日總領事於日前（二十一日）向余表示遺憾時、曾聲明對於焚燒之三友實業工廠之浪人、决當嚴密緝獲、依照日本法律從嚴懲辦、</p>
<p>最後通牒非確繼謂前昨兩日、中外各報、均刋載星期四晚、有駐華日本第一艦隊司令鹽澤少將、以哀　美敦　致余、要求對華人抗日運動及毆擊日僑案、立即予以圓滿答復云云、本人可鄭重聲明、截至今日（二十三日）四時、即與君晤談之時、並未有該項文件收到、而且在外交關係依然存在之時、在滬市方面之中日一切往來其對象、一方面爲上海市政府市長、一方面爲日本駐　領事署總領事故於情理上　、日艦司令無直接致書於余之權、</p>
<p>决採正當防衛記者又問如果日人不顧一切而大舉騷擾、則市長之意以爲如何、答、此事中央政府早有命令、如果有人侵入内地領土、决採正當防衛、且滬市治安上之防範、早已有相當準備、苟遇事變即採必要手段、</p>
<p>我應鎭靜處理但關於此等日浪人挑釁事件、無論政府民衆均應鎭靜處理、始能消滅無形、蓋所謂見怪不怪、其怪自滅、因日浪人之心目中、惟恐我之不亂、若再自相驚擾、適予彼人以機會、然余（吳自稱）所謂鎭靜處理者、並非謂任彼行兇騷擾即彼以非法之行兇騷擾對我我應以正當之手續制裁之、</p>
<p>市府和平政策總之、市政府對於此等糾紛事件之交涉、其政策一以和平解决爲前提、</p>
<p>華租向係合作自日浪人焚燒一友實業社工廠後、各團體曾請增派軍警、協助工部局維持地方治安、昨據吳市長表示、市政府對於維持地方、向來與工部局合作若派軍警至租界、事實上似感困難云云、</p>
<p>華界防範嚴密華界警務當局、昨亦防範甚密、事前公安局曾接得警備司令部令、着於昨日嚴防溫局長當令五區全體警士武裝出防並派警察第二中隊一百餘名赴閘北放極密之步哨至接近四川路之華界、天通庵路、寳興路、寳山路江灣路、一帶、防範更爲嚴重、警備司令部亦調大批軍隊、前在彈壓、入夜雖未宣布戒嚴但巡邏極密云、</p>
<p>租界昨日戒嚴昨日公共租界當局、以日人宣傳、將於昨日午後三時、假蓬路開居留民大會、於是遂引起注意、工部局昨特通知租界中央戈登新閘普陀路靜安寺哈爾濱虹口匯司匯山狄思威路楊樹浦等十二　　、實行嚴防、並派全體中西探捕、出外巡邏、又駕紅色警備車、赴各重要機關、加以保護、</p>

<p>日人不欲侵犯租界中立字林報云、昨晨第一人至駐滬日總領事者、爲工部局總董麥克那丹少將、麥氏與日總領事村井之會商、除聞曾討論鹽澤海軍司令之宣言外、其結果未經宣　、又麥氏與工部局總裁費信惇、昨晨同訪鹽澤司令、討論所謂日本哀的美敦書事、鹽澤謂非先通知工部局當道、决不在租界内有何行動、又謂日人今皆欲制止上海之抗日活動、並得中國當道對日總領事要求之滿意答覆、日人並不欲侵犯公共租界之中立、或干涉工部局努力維持租界法紀之職務云、</p>

<p>有五個偉大的希望</p>
<p>願國人一致贊助之</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會、日前歡迎熊秉三先生、茲錄其演講詞如、次</p>
<p>（上略）希齡服務社會、有十五六年了、從前過的是政界生活、和老百姓隔膜太遠、就不知道怎麽呌作民間疾苦、自從民國五年辦理一回水災、親自下去查勘、這纔知道農村生活的狀况、和我們政治界從前的錯誤與罪惡、就把政治看得淡了、毅然决然把牠擱開、實力和社會服務、想到人民是國家的根本、小孩子是人民的基礎、况且已經長成了人的、好壞都是定規了、沒法子再來改進、惟有小孩子是沒有　開的一個大、璞沒有染汚的一張白紙、只要下些工夫、把他敎訓好、個個都爲健全國民、這是多麽要緊的問題呢、所以我從這個地方下手、趁着北平從前有個慈幼局、我就在災區收容災童、久而久之越收越多、到了二萬人以上、慈幼局是不能容納的、另闢一個地方養育他們、不過是有飯吃有衣穿而已、等了幾個月、災情平復了、他們的父母們陸續來把他們領回家去了、勝下無父母無依靠沒人領的、還有一兩千人、這纔開辦香山慈幼院、辦理了幾年毫無成效、急的我沒有法子、仔細的一研究、纔悟道他們當官樣文章去做、所以越弄越糟、我就親自下去一辦開幾個工廠、設幾個學校、雖說不大好、比着從前自信的强得多、只爲我近幾年的研究所得、和我們院襄發生問題、今天和各位慈善大家聚首一堂我就發生了五個希、望第一呢、是統一全國的慈幼團體、互以所長、互補所短、我們辦慈善事業、的都是經濟困難、就不是經濟困難的、亦難把天下事事都做、到比方我們慈幼、凡是幼童都要　慈的、若是該幼童身體康健、智慧聰明、自然是沒有問題、若是遇着殘廢的兒童、（或盲或聾、或啞或跛、或先天遺傳梅毒、或有肺病、或有麻痼病、）或是劣性兒童、要是收留他、妨害了大多數兒童、若是不收留他、一定病的病死了、壞的犯法了、於我們慈幼的原則、大相背謬、這拿甚麽法子來補救呢、必得設盲童學校·及各種殘廢院·與各種專門醫院、以安置殘廢兒童、設感化院·敎導院、以安置劣性兒童、試問這一些事業、一個機關能彀辦到嗎、所以我希望中華慈幼協會把這個担子担起、來連合全國各慈幼團體、和慈善團體、遇有上項各兒童、則分别送於各該專門團體收養、像這個樣子、纔沒有抛棄的兒童纔、與我們慈幼的良心上交代得過去、、這是第一個希望</p>
<p>第二呢、是以科學的新智識、改善中國之幼稚敎育、中國的大病一個是窮、一個是愚、窮的當然是沒有敎育的機會、富的又往往不知道敎育的方法不是失之過嚴、就是失之過寬、再不然、吸鴉片啊、又麻雀、啊看戲啊、只知道過着富人的日子、不知道却給小孩子造了一個惡環境、試問這個樣子、還配談敎育嗎、也有把子弟送入學校的、但都是六七歲以後的初小年齡、姑無論小學的敎育如何、這幼稚敎育、就簡直談不到了、况且兒童的智慧與身體健康、有莫大的關係、有的小孩患遺尿的病、呆笨的不得了、人人討厭、後來把他的病治好了、讀書亦一天一天的聰明了、可見得身體康健、與智慧有密切關係、而兒童得不着正當的娱樂、也要妨害他的身體健康、這都是我最近考查出來的、我深知道中華慈幼協會、注重在兒童敎育、不是說專門救濟苦兒連那富兒的敎育方法、也要仔細的研究、所以我希望中華慈幼協會把這個担子担起來、聯絡專門慈幼人才、以科學的新智識、來改善這幼稚敎育、這是我的第二個希望、</p>
<p>第三呢、是設立保姆學校、訓練專門慈幼人才、我們中國從前有個說法、是未有學養子而後嫁者也、可見得我們中國對於撫育兒童之道、漢然不講、一旦有了孩子、亦就是人云亦云的聽其自</p>
<p>生自滅、窮人就不必說了、單說富人、一有小孩、就僱奶媽、不知道當奶媽的處處刁難東家、常以不幹了爲要挾、究竟他有撫兒的學識嗎、不過是沒有這種人材、也就不能不將就啦、我打算設了一個幼慈園、有兩種問題、一是年齡的關係、園裏小孩以四歲爲起點、但是所收來四歲的小孩、都是營養不良、不能上課、必得先把他身子養好再說、等他養好了、至快亦得一年半載、就超過了年齡、要能解决這個問、題必得同時設一個蒙養院、從兩三歲收起、先放在蒙養院裏調養他的身體、養好了再入幼稚園上課、這繼不担擱他的光陰、一件就是保姆的關係、要是設蒙養院、非有保姆不可、但是舊社會上沒有這種人才、新學家又沒有訓練這個專家、怎麽好呢、於是呌我的女兒到美國哥崙比亞大學專門研究慈幼的問</p>
<p>題、遠水不能救近渴、乃作一試騐、設了一個保姆班、以期養成專門人才、又設蒙養院·幼稚園·各一處、爲實地練習暫陸收養的幼兒、他們的家世、都是很好的因、爲種種問題、不能維持生活現狀、而他的母親又有好些都是受過敎育的、我想了一個法子收來、他的小孩、就呌他的母親來當保姆、酌給薪工、以一年爲限、有時呌訓練班的學生來服務練習、替出他的身子來人班訓練、這種人才、如果多了、可分配各地方去服務、我希望中華慈幼協會把這個担子担起來、物色專門保姆人才、研究專門保敎幼兒的辦法、貢獻到社會上去、這就是我的第三個希望、</p>
<p>右中華慈幼協會總幹事吳惟德先生</p>
<p>中熊希齡先生</p>
<p>左中華慈幼協會執行委員胡宣明博士第四呢、是每年召集全國慈幼會議、不是事情難辦、實是人才難得、不是沒有眞正高尙的專門人才、實在是也因爲經濟困難、請他不起、譬如我香山慈幼院、從前本是注重在工藝、所以開了幾個廠、如隨其性情相近學習工藝、但不能不給他一個普通的智識、所以又開幾班學校、有初小·高小·初中三級、後來看他們很有優秀的也不能埋沒了、又開一級高中、爲他們升學的地步、後來看畢業的學生、有很好的成績、應該入大學、我們限於經濟實在的開不起、又不忍阻他們的上進、乃和香山農工銀行商量、請他借欵給學生們爲人大學的費用、供他畢業後、以大學生的資格、得的報酬必優、再來還本、這種辦法銀行亦不虧本、學生亦不屈、才現在已經入大學的很有幾個了、惟是辦一班學校、不論人數多少、請敎員、闢敎室、置辦一切敎育用品、是一樣亦不能少的、計算起來、有一班高中、必得有兩班初中、有一班初中、必得有二班高小、纔够升學的、我們本院、常有學生不够、升班之嘆、前此中華慈幼協會送來學生十名、現在程度都很好了、假若全國的慈幼團體、能聯絡一氣、把此校的學生、送到彼校、旣可省開班的困難、又沒有缺額的情形、且能以交換智識、以後慈幼的事業、自然的蒸蒸日上了、擬仿造全國商會·全國敎育會·的辦法、召集全國會議、輪流在各地舉行、即可就近調查各該地之慈幼團體、互謀改良、這是我的第四個希望、</p>
<p>第五個呢、是喚起社會同情、引起民衆注意、去年中華慈幼協會曾經呈請國府准以四月四日爲兒童節、並由敎育部通令各學校舉行、今年四月四日、應當舉行、作擴大宣傳、但是這個宣傳、有兩個意義、一是呌社會民衆都了然於慈幼事業之重要、大家都起來、專心研究怎麽敎怎麽養實力贊助我們、一是仿造美國金規日的辦法、（美國金規日那一天、全國各處爲苦兒捐欵、又名兒童幸福日、）我們可以倣照辦理、請全國慈幼善士盡力捐助、共　義舉、這是我的第五個希望、（下略）</p>

<p>兒子要在做上學在做上敎，這是沒有疑義的。我希望每個兒子做成一個什麽樣的兒子，我得把我自己先做成那樣一個兒子。我要敎我的兒子自立立人我自己就得自立立人。我要敎我的兒子自助助人，我自己就得自助助人。最近我和小孩們商議出一個自立立人自助助人的敎學做過程，内分四個階段第一個階段三餐餵得飽，個個喊寳寳；</p>
<p>第二個階段小事小幹幹，零用自己賺；</p>
<p>第三個階段全部衣食住，不靠别人助；</p>
<p>第四個階段自活有餘力，帮助人自立。</p>
<p>我現在第四個孩子六歲尙在第一個階段：第三個孩子，九歲，在鄕下時，已到第二階段，現在進城來又回到第一階段。第二個孩子十三歲是在第二個階段；第一個孩子十七歲是上了第三個階段：同時大家還在求學，一起向了第四個階段努力前進。</p>
<p>中國社會對於小孩的敎育普通只有兩個階段：一是全然依賴；二是忽然自立。這中間缺少漸進的橋梁。倘若成人突遇變故，小孩失其所依，這是多麽難受的痛苦啊！</p>

<p>遼吉陷落。期且百餘日矣。守土長官旣不抵抗於前。負責政府又不赴援兵於後。馬將軍獨木難支大厦。小百姓赤手無俾實際。行見神州陸沉。將不爲我有矣。於是黑江白水間。豪俠之士。奮臂而起。拒賄殺敵。震塞賊膽。如小白龍老北風其尤者也。客有自芝罘來者。爲余述小白龍計敗日軍事。聞之熱血奔騰。撫掌稱快。黑馬白龍。要亦大可風已。</p>
<p>小白龍張姓興田其字也。河北平谷縣人。早歲業商善騎善射鏢。豪俠好義。扶弱鋤暴。殊不以操貿遷術爲意。食客三千。雅有孟嘗遺風。不數載。家産蕩然。卒至結夥綠林。然仍不改其常態。遇豪富宦屬則刦之。貧苦者反賙濟之。去年春。曾一度爲省府受撫。但嗣又重爲馮婦。當去年十月間。日人正藉國聯袒護之餘威。逞意橫行。竟欲下錦州。駐津沽。日人久聞白龍之勇悍。陰以日金萬元。盒砲步槍子彈數百箱賄以發難。龍佯允而受之。日人大悅。以爲支那人士盡是貪贖侮國之流一鼓而下板圖不難易色也。龍旣財械兩足。忽大襲日軍。敵死甚衆。日方大怒。傾師圖報復。龍知非敵。亟竄通遼山谷中。來去敏㨗。出沒無常。日人對之憤恨切齒。現白龍正欲與馬將軍及民團聯絡一氣。共圖殲敵云。</p>

<p>— 睡麟</p>
<p>馮氏治軍之嚴。爲國人習聞。肅政之方。亦無出其右。薛篤弼。過之渙。爲馮氏之左輔右弼。薛掌政務。過掌財務。從政之勤與操守之堅。皆有聲於時。當馮氏底定河南之後。事務較在關内益煩。馮氏每日晨到辦公廳。文武百僚。次第接納。稍有不合。罰打罰跪。罰面壁者。難得一日免。不獨官職微小者如此。雖有薛過之尊。亦所不免。一日。馮坐廣廳。薛立右給事。因稍忤其旨。遂斥以耳光。限即時重辦。過有忤。亦如之。事後薛過亦無怨言。馮氏從政。夙服一古諺。恒舉以告人曰。「從政不在多言。力行而已」。</p>
<p>河南敎育。向較蘇浙爲遜。馮氏力圖振作。除在開封辦有訓政學院。造就應急人才。而各中學之敎員。均列上選。一時京</p>
<p>滬稍有文名之靑年。如衆流奔壑。爭相趨之。靑年界遂掀起一種口號曰。「到河南去」。其勢不可侮。於此槪見。惜乎不久戰起。遂中輟。</p>
<p>第一次全國國術比賽大會。會塲設南京體育塲。開幕之日。各要人相繼蒞止。例皆演說。演說臺在比賽臺之北。民衆在比賽臺之南。相距有二十餘丈。最初數人演說。聽者不甚了了。只見其口講指畫而已。至馮氏演說。均能聽淸。說者謂馮氏演說。能聽十萬人洵非虚語。是日演說之大意。略謂今日在此地看。心内就要學。家去就要做。時約兩分鐘。簡潔扼要。</p>

<p>畢生不近女色的畸人英國白明罕Ｂｉｒｍｉｎｇｈａｍ城中。有一位老者。名白立斯惠德Ａ·Ｂｌｙｔｈｗａｉｔｅ今年八十七歲。自稱生平不近女色。從來沒有和一個女子接過吻。他曾對人說。『我自生長起來。初知人事以後。第一步就是力求自立。而不需女性的助力。我在十四歲時。便學着給自己織襪。給自己縫襯衫上的鈕扣。』二十三歲時。他更獨自料理家中的工作。自己烹飪。自己洗衣。平日也絶不和女性往來。終年只有一次有女性踏進他的屋子。便是耶穌聖誕節他的姊姊跑來探望他。最近他又對人說『我已八十七歲了。我很健康。我很快樂。我又有錢存在銀行中。端爲我從沒有和女性接過吻。所以能如此。』但是這樣的生活。未免太枯燥些。而太沒有玩意兒吧。</p>

<p>— 疑始</p>
<p>惜陰書齋人夏子宜滋。所製自怡印泥。卓絶一時。一年以還。夏子於製泥方術。益復鑽研不懈。續有創發。所製各種印泥。視前更爲精勝。蓋眞已登峯造極。符合理想標準。絶後未敢言。空前固無疑已。夏子非得良材。不輕製泥。蒐求之勤。亦至罕見。夏間又從湘中覓得四年前丹砂十餘斤。揀選菁英。研鍊數月。製成藕絲印泥數十兩。色澤品質之美。雖宣和水印。不能不相形見絀。乾隆赤城。自更瞠乎其後。印泥油肉匀凈最難。砂愈佳。質愈重。油則以淸輕爲貴。重沉輕浮。物理自爾。故印泥之精者。置之缸中。數日不調。往往見油上泛。渟蓄四周。鈐印　紙。亦易滋油輪廓之外。但能著紙不黃。日久泯然無迹。已是精之又精。至若品質較遜者。油本膩滯。泥於缸中。固尙求其泛油而不可得。夏子此次所製。縱令經月不調。亦無泛油四周。上稀下稠之象。（但時時翻調。所以使印泥日益鮮麗精美。易於團結脫缸。終不可廢。）鈐印著紙。更乏絲毫油跡可見。其研鍊調製之精。尤爲絶無僅有。又純砂印泥。初始製成。色每黯淡。歷久始漸光潤紅艷。世俗輒因求其紅艷之速。　加洋紅雲硃。俾製成即易悅目。顧純砂印泥。歷一二年紅艷即與初加洋紅者相等。更久則遠過洋紅。脫缸後尤爲美麗。而羼洋紅者。其色必將積日以褪。且永無脫缸之期。審此。自曉然於純砂印泥之所以可貴。夏子製泥。意在傳世。力戒以紫亂朱。矢志不羼洋紅硃標。所製自怡印泥。能有脫缸之證據。故與俗製逈異。此次製成之始。色澤已與藏歷二三年者同其光潤紅艷。使更經歷歲月。精美彌將不可思議。脫缸亦必視前製易而且速。以上兩端。益爲夏子此次所製藕絲印泥後來居上之最大優點。夏子本其經騐之富。鑽研之深。故能愈製愈精。月前不侫啜茗惜陰書齋。獲見此新成之品。歎爲印泥之皇。友好之精於鑒賞者。亦多謂評得其當。夏子喜不自勝。戲以泥皇名其齋閣。不侫因鐫泥皇閣印贈之。并爲署膀張之閣中焉。（却酬）</p>

<p>電影明星胡蝶女士之自述</p>
<p>北平後來，「啼笑因緣」是開始工作了。因爲片中的外景要眞實，所以决定到北平去攝取。北平，是我舊游之地啊！我彷彿還記得那些崇高的宮殿，古樸的城垣，中央公園裏的游人，馬路上漂亮的洋車，乾爽的天氣，强烈的陽光，以至北平人的淸脆的語音，率直的態度，······一切，一切，雖然睽隔了多年，而沒有使我忘記過。所以，當這個出發北平的消息，在公司中公布了以後，許多人都像我一樣的快樂，在將出發之前，我和許多沒有去過北平的人講着北平的景物，幾乎使北平成爲我們的一個天國了。最有趣的，我告訴他們在北平出二十塊大洋可以住一宅大房子。同足使在上海住亭子間的朋友們驚奇；我告訴他們在北平終年不見大雨時，程步高先生却懊喪地把新購置的雨衣從旅行箱裏取出來了。</p>
<p>開步走在一羣懷着無限趣味無限熱望的人的中間，我尤其是得意的一個。這時大家已從準備的忙碌中甦醒了回來，用一種似乎帶些應有的客套的表情向我們的攝影塲告别丨丨可是沒有一些别離的情緖丨幾輛汽車載着一羣歡笑的孩子似的人們去了。從此時起，我們便又像置身於另一個世界之中。</p>
<p>從上海北站到濟南於是我們的一羣無時不爲他人所注目了，「這就是明星影戲公司到北平去攝啼笑因緣的」「這是胡蝶，」······「這是鄭小秋」······「這是······」成爲耳朶裏所熟聞的許多話；「十目所視，十手所指，」我們似乎更不止受得這些嚴重的監視。在車上，我們看看報，談談話，到也不覺得長途的疲倦·旅程中的一切我也說不盡瑣碎的許多事。只記得，到了濟南，居然會有許多新聞記者特地上車來訪問，張石川先生笑着對我們說：「榮幸得很！這是對於要人們的待遇啊。」</p>

<p>『古之人恒愛劍靑萍三尺燭下出視覺家國深仇莫不將憑此以報今劍已成過去之武器而中國武裝難與世界比衡致使英雄志士徒拊髀興嘆深宵獨坐憤氣如山惟抽××香烟吸之尙足稍消塊壘······』</p>
<p>如像這樣的『廣告文學』在上海風行一時早已「司空外見慣」用不着去批評</p>
<p>「吸××牌香烟」即足以示「不忘愛國」這種羅輯是上海的廣告文學的特色·以此例推「雲貴四川土産鴉片」亦是仍示「不忘愛國」「打麻雀」「賭牌九」仍是「不忘愛國」因爲雲貴川土是國貨中之上乘麻雀牌九亦是國貨中之上乘所以仍是「不忘愛國」呀</p>
<p>况且愛國之道甚多「戀愛不忘救國」「讀書不忘救國」「做官不忘愛國」以至於「嫖娼不忘救國」這種理論都是十分符合羅輯的並且還是絶對的眞理</p>
<p>但是日本人在虹口北四川路一帶暴動燒了三友實業社搗毁了中國商店我們的救國團體决死隊義勇軍仍舊是在開會演說貼標語發通電　　其實在筆下紙上口頭切實做救國工夫的原不止侔利的商人投機的政客浮囂的靑年就是我們國家的偉人們亦復不外乎此</p>
<p>每個偉人的宣言通電計劃大綱都是滿紙連篇的「不忘愛國」實際上都是賣膏藥的勾當不出乎「抽××牌香烟仍不忘愛國」的原則</p>

<p>但是我們底誓死力爭的目的好容易獲了完滿的結果最後我們是往前線了去努力完成我們的殺敵工作呀！在這槍林彈雨的一刹那無數的兇暴的仇敵通通閃進我們的眼簾裏這時啊！妬心激發的我已恨不得馬上用我沸熱的鮮血和這大無畏的精神掃蕩這彌天的妖氣一洗我們極大恥辱但前進的號聲起了我們是多麽的愉快啊？於是像飛般的健足也在顯牠的神通冲到敵人的陣線裏而我這殺敵的神槍一陣陣的發出熱騰騰的彈丸終於飛進敵人的要害而敵人的陣線也完全動搖起來了最後我們是佔據了敵宼整個的防地而獲了最大的勝利了瓊妹！這消息傳到你耳裏我想也許會很快慰的吧？</p>
<p>現在我們又要本着勇往直前的精神去和這野蠻的敵寇相見了但這嘹亮的號聲也奏起來了！啊！瓊急須整裝待發的我也只得暫爲擱筆了瓊妹！再會吧！祝你</p>

<p>這是一個物理有趣的把戲人人都可試騐所費無幾而得到物理上一個重要原理</p>
<p>現在把幾件需用的物品預備起來就是一個新鮮雞蛋一個高大的玻璃瓶裝滿了水還要一包鹽</p>
<p>先把蛋放進瓶裏蛋比水重自然沉到瓶底現在把鹽慢慢的一點一點放到水裏去一面把水攪動等到鹽放到適當分量的時候那雞蛋就完全服從你的命令你把牠提起放在瓶的中央你的手只管拿開牠還是停着不動你再把牠提高一些或者放低一點牠也惟命是聽不敢自己亂動</p>
<p>這種現象的原理說來也十分簡單因爲雞蛋的比重比淸水大所以蛋往下沉水裏加鹽使淸水變成鹽水鹽水的比重大於淸水鹽加得越多比重也越大等到鹽水和蛋的比重相等時蛋就不浮不沉的停在水中了假使再加點鹽使鹽水的比重比蛋還大那蛋就浮在水面了</p>
<p>同時還有一椿想起來很可笑的事實同這個試騐是一個道理不妨附帶說說大家曉得在耶路撒冷城之東有一個鹹水湖名呌死海那裏面的水含有百分之二十五鹽分比重特别大無論什麽人跑到那裏邊去都可以很安全的游永呢街頭社會學</p>

<p>「先生少爺······做點好事吧！······」的一陣亂呌晚上比較安寗一點吧？眞的確是安寗一些！但不久那種呼籲會在寂靜的夜裏幽幽的弄堂又打動你的心弦：</p>
<p>「橄欖買一顆了一鈿······檀香橄欖呵······買橄欖！······」</p>
<p>這聲音總是淸淅的婉囀的比什麽音樂都自然都妙逸！可是他的尾音太哀了太酸了！再不能忍聽！</p>
<p>不久又聽到：</p>

<p>英美兵部署旣定遂於當日下午三時半揚旗鳴鼓進至花園弄（即今之南京路）由是更進至今之南京路與浙江路之間（即從前之跑馬塲之東界）停止前進以待吉營官軍之動作繼見官軍毫無動作英美聯軍自度以三百八十人進攻二千餘人未必能勝於是頓覺氣銼但兵旣出動亦不肯撤回示弱遂分兵爲兩隊美軍由跑馬塲之左側進攻官軍正面英軍向前方直進攻官軍之側面</p>
<p>據當時隨美兵出發之衛提摩爾（Ｗ·ＳＷｅｔｍｏｒｅ）之目擊談美軍隨砲兩尊陣於墳坪之間距吉營不過二三百碼至下午四時開列鳴槍爲號開始進攻英軍亦同時進擊忽於塜墓累累之荒草中有無數紅點攢動極速是乃城中小刀會黨出城助外人同擊官兵也於此可見外人事先早與小刀會有約故敢以三百餘人進攻二千餘人及至紅頭愈集多官軍陣營動搖遂開始撤退</p>
<p>美軍司開列即乘勢下令衝鋒不意忽爲泥溝所阻溝寬十五呎至二十呎中有水約四呎乃吉營之外濠也濠内爲高墻有六七呎高美兵至此爲官軍之砲火所阻乃退回墳坪未幾槍聲止息美軍作戰經過亦止於此阻止美軍前進的濠溝名周家涇浜在事後若干年劃入泥城浜之界内</p>
<p>至於英軍方面直向前進得遇一橋前過周涇浜乃改道向左向第一營房襲擊因營房前置有大砲英軍遂少有死傷但卒進至營側副艦長杜首先入營官軍無意久戰遂縱火焚營房而去全軍退至縣城之南</p>
<p>官軍所以退却之原因一因小刀會出城助外兵一因恐啓外交造成大禍而吉爾杭柯之缺乏軍事知識不善於應戰又爲失敗原因之一</p>
<p>是役也英美聯軍死者二人傷者十五人中有二人後因傷重身死官軍死傷亦不過五十人此所謂「泥城之戰」也　　法軍助官軍攻城</p>
<p>當時縣城仍爲小刀會所據官重如欲攻取縣城非先斷租界方面之接濟不可此顯然之事實也法國海軍司令辣厄爾（Ａｄｍｉｒａｌ　Ｌａｇｕｅｒｒｅ）以爲城中刀匪之所以頑强抵抗皆由英人暗中接濟所致遂責英人不能嚴守中立</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Sun Ke held a meeting at Song's residence in Beijige at 4 PM on the 23rd, engaging in a lengthy discussion regarding foreign affairs, which adjourned at 7 PM. The content, due to its relation to foreign affairs, was not disclosed. It is vaguely heard that Chiang, Wang, Sun, and others believe that the increasingly severe foreign affairs situation requires genuine unity and a full commitment to address it. Therefore, their opinions were highly consistent during the meeting. After the meeting, Chiang and Wang did not attend the Lin's banquet, only Sun attended. After the banquet, Sun and key figures such as He Yingqin and Zhu Peide held further talks upstairs at the Lishi Society, discussing ways to address the current foreign affairs situation for a long time, adjourning at 8:30 PM. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9 PM on the 23rd, Sun convened a meeting at his private residence with Foreign Minister Chen Youren and other responsible ministers to study foreign affairs and other issues, which adjourned late into the night. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Affairs Committee, following Wang's instructions, has scheduled a discussion meeting for 4 PM on the 24th at the Lishi Society, convening all special committee members. The notification was issued on the evening of the 23rd. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the question of whether or not to sever diplomatic relations with Japan, the government has accommodated the proposals of Gu Weijun and others. Opinions have been exchanged for days, all trending towards caution. Wang and Chiang both advocate for first stabilizing the internal situation before dealing with external aggression. Duan Qirui's letter to friends in Beijing also mentioned that only the effective Yue King Goujian could avenge the humiliation after twenty years. In addition, for several days, our embassies in London, Washington, and Paris have sent telegrams reporting the attitudes of their host countries towards the Northeast issue. Hu Shize also sent a lengthy telegram to Beijing, reporting on the atmosphere among the delegations from various countries in Geneva. Chen Youren repeatedly examined the meaning of the telegrams, appearing quite anxious. According to a certain key figure, although the political situation has gradually stabilized after Wang and Chiang came to Beijing, it is still difficult to see immediate progress in foreign affairs. It is like a doctor treating a severely injured person; it is impossible to restore health immediately. Therefore, it is necessary to first strengthen the heart to prevent the injury from worsening. The arrival of Wang and Chiang in Beijing is precisely to maintain the heart's function. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Liu Daqun, Japan's military actions are expanding daily. Merely talking about severing diplomatic relations at this time is not a proactive solution. Since we have proposed an economic blockade to the League of Nations, we should implement it ourselves first. Because Japan's trade with China accounts for 20% of its total trade, and with the United States, it accounts for 45%. If both China and the United States implement a blockade, the impact will be even greater. Even if we act alone, it will be more effective than boycotting Japanese goods. Therefore, for a thorough resistance against Japan, we should take the initiative first and not always be in a passive position. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi and Chen Youren both departed for Shanghai by night train on the 23rd. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Shanghai Japanese Residents' Riot Case: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables the League of Nations <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Yan Huiqing Has Arrived in Geneva</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables Proposal Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of Japanese residents in Shanghai destroying the Sanyou Factory and brutally killing Chinese police officers, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering that the League of Nations meeting is scheduled for the 25th, and to ensure that the representatives of various countries understand the details of the case and are not misled by the Japanese side, has specifically telegraphed the detailed circumstances of the case to our country's Chief Representative, Yan Huiqing, instructing him to report to the League of Nations at the meeting to obtain a fair judgment. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing has arrived in Geneva. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent our country's proposal by long telegram today, instructing Yan to first submit the proposal to the League of Nations Secretariat, and at the same time, to contact the representatives of various countries separately, so that the representatives of the League of Nations deeply understand the recent situation of the Northeast being victimized. A reporter from a certain agency interviewed Gan Jiehou yesterday, who said that the outcome of this meeting, whether good or bad, not only affects the interests of China and Japan themselves but is actually crucial to the safety of the world. In other words, it can be said to be the last opportunity to test whether human justice can exist. In the past, our country did not want international disputes to occur, so it exercised restraint everywhere, hoping that the Japanese side would awaken. Unexpectedly, the facts were the opposite of our wishes. Therefore, this time, we have no choice but to request the League of Nations to jointly impose sanctions based on Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant. If, unfortunately, the League of Nations fails to pass our country's proposal, not to mention the bankruptcy of the League of Nations' own credibility, our country will, of course, have defensive preparations to take further steps to resist and control power. The League of Nations investigation team will travel from Europe to the United States and then to China in early February. Our country's representative has already appointed Gu Weijun. The most important preparation for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the collection of various materials on Japan's atrocities since September 18th. However, after Japan occupied the Northeast, important evidence was covered up, making progress quite difficult. It is heard that the Northeast Diplomatic Committee has collected some information, but it is not the whole picture. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically telegraphed the Northeast authorities on the 23rd to select several diplomatic personnel to come to Beijing quickly to assist. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

(23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital's Anti-Japanese Association held a meeting on the 23rd. Believing that the selected members of the initiated National Crisis Conference do not truly represent the national public opinion, they decided to petition the central government to convene a National Salvation Conference as soon as possible. Furthermore, due to the riots in Shanghai by the Japanese and the dispatch of a large number of warships to Shanghai to threaten, creating a serious situation, they decided to petition the central government to seriously negotiate to achieve the goal of punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation.

<p>(Nanjing) Tonight, Lin Sen hosted a banquet for Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Li Zongren, and others at the Lishi Society. Wang declined due to illness, entrusting Zeng Zhongming to deliver a letter to Lin, which read: "Esteemed Mr. Zichao, I am deeply grateful for your invitation to dine. I have not recovered from my illness, and I am following the doctor's dietary restrictions. Furthermore, I must take medication before and after meals, so I am unable to accept your invitation. Please understand and forgive me. It is my sincerest hope." (23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang sent Zeng Zhongming to answer the inquiries of reporters: 1. Severing diplomatic relations with Japan is a matter of great importance and must be thoroughly studied before expressing a comprehensive opinion based on facts and opinions. It is inappropriate for an individual to express any opinion separately. 2. The National Crisis Conference gathers the opinions of many people to study all difficult problems, which is truly important. However, I currently have no opinion to express on this matter. 3. When I was in Hangzhou, I sent several telegrams to Mr. Hu Hanmin, but I have not yet received a reply. 4. The results of the leaders' discussions on financial and diplomatic issues only involved a general exchange of views, with no specific decisions made. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Presenting Three Conditions for Working Outside the Pass</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than a thousand employees of the Beining Railway outside the Pass have arrived in Tianjin. The railway bureau has urged them to return to work outside the Pass. Recently, more than two hundred people left the Pass but were subjected to abuse by the Japanese army. Those in Tianjin dare not risk going again. On the 23rd, they formed a team to petition the railway bureau, demanding: 1. All section chiefs and stationmasters outside the Pass must return to their posts. 2. Please send responsible personnel from the engineering, machinery, and traffic departments to escort them. 3. Return the original police and security teams to each station to provide armed protection. The director of the transportation department, Wang Fengrui, responded on behalf of the bureau, stating that the first two items would be fully complied with, but the third item was difficult to implement due to practical obstacles and was temporarily unachievable. The workers said that if the third item could not be implemented, they could not leave the Pass. "We are not afraid of death, but we must die with value. If we are placed under the iron hooves of the Japanese army and allowed to be slaughtered, we are unwilling. If the bureau can provide weapons and ammunition, thousands of our colleagues are willing to drive the Japanese pirates outside the Beining line. Even if we all die, we would be happy to do so." Wang said that the issue was too big and he could not respond. The workers decided to petition the bureau again on the 24th. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Visited Chiang to Report on the Situation in Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zuobin arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd. In the afternoon, he met with Chiang at the Mausoleum, reporting in detail on the telegrams he received from the embassy in Japan regarding the resolutions of the Japanese cabinet on the 22nd and the attitude that our government should take. He then attended Lin Sen's banquet. According to Jiang Zuobin, the increase in Japanese warships coming to Shanghai raises the question of whether they will imitate the Tianjin Incident and create a tragedy. Because Shanghai is extremely important in terms of international relations, it cannot be compared to Tianjin. He believes it will not be easy for the Japanese to create such an incident. However, since the Japanese are determined to provoke trouble, trouble can be aroused and expanded everywhere. Therefore, the government should pay close attention to preventing this matter.

<h3 id="e35">Austerity Policy and Clean Government <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Due to the extreme financial difficulties, the central government has recently decided to vigorously implement an austerity policy. According to a special dispatch from Nanjing, starting from the 21st of this month, the Ministries of Industry, Railways, Communications, and Foreign Affairs will all, based on the resolutions of the State Council, vigorously reduce government spending, implement the abolishment of redundant organizations, and reduce one-third of public officials. Moreover, salaries will be reduced and issued according to grade. In the current situation of financial depletion and near bankruptcy, it is of course a necessary policy to live within one's means and practice austerity. However, there are many reasons for today's financial depletion. Austerity is certainly one aspect of reorganizing finances, but the effect is ultimately minimal. This is because the biggest reason for the financial depletion is the excessive expenditure on non-productive and even obstructive activities. The most obvious is that military spending accounts for more than 80% of the budget, and another is the lack of integrity of the government. These two major reasons are the crux of the financial bankruptcy of our country. If we want to talk about reorganizing finances today, we must first start with reducing military spending and building a clean government. Layoffs, reducing government spending, and salary cuts are only minor aspects. "Seeing the tip of an autumn hair, but not seeing a cartload of firewood." What kind of effect can this austerity policy have?</p>
<p>Regarding the excessive expenditure on non-productive and even obstructive activities, we will not discuss it here. Instead, we will begin by elucidating the point of lack of integrity.</p>
<p>Today, the lack of integrity of the government and the corruption of most politicians (of course, there are also many who are self-disciplined) have become an undeniable fact. Military commanders embezzle military pay, administrative officials embezzle public funds, inflate expenses, and create various names for so-called secret fees and activity fees to fill their own pockets, regarding the national treasury as their private outer treasury. Moreover, buying and selling official positions and bribery are rampant. This is especially evident in financial institutions. A look through the years of telegrams between government officials revealing each other's private secrets will reveal this kind of inside story.</p>
<p>If politicians could all be honest and self-disciplined, and not engage in fraud and embezzlement, we would ask, even if the salary of someone in a high position such as a minister is only 800 yuan, how can they afford such lavish lifestyles? The current "important people" mostly have towering Western-style houses in the concessions and huge sums of money deposited in foreign banks. Is this kind of luxury and extravagance possible with only a salary of 800 yuan? There is a saying, "Frugality nourishes integrity." If one cannot be frugal, we cannot believe that one can be honest. We ask, if one does not engage in corruption and embezzlement, where does this arbitrarily squandered huge sum of money come from?</p>
<p>In addition to direct corruption and embezzlement, the means of profiting are becoming more and more numerous. Most politicians use their privileged position to know the inside story of the changing situation in advance, as well as its impact on the financial world, and engage in large-scale speculation, such as trading in public bonds and gold. The rise and fall of market prices are certainly due to the changing situation on the one hand, but they are also due to the manipulation of speculators on the other. As a result, the government suffers a loss of credit, small and medium-sized businesses are affected, but the speculators among the government officials sit back and reap huge profits. Last year, the US Secretary of the Treasury was accused of engaging in business, but in our country, it can be done openly and has become a legal and necessary "side business" for politicians.</p>
<p>Because politics is not transparent and the government is not clean, bureaucracy dominates the entire political organization. If one person becomes an official, the whole family becomes officials, and the entire clan becomes officials. Those who have connections are even more likely to occupy important positions and high ranks. Just as the saying goes, "When a man attains enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven."</p>
<p>Politicians are like this, and the entire political organization is like this. How can politics be clean, and how can finances be reorganized? Salary cuts are limited, and after the salary cuts, how can one not compensate by engaging in fraud? Layoffs are even more limited. Even if they can be laid off, they are only limited to ordinary small employees without backing. Moreover, they cannot thoroughly clarify politics. Simply laying off personnel leaves public officials without any guarantee. Everyone has the mentality of "being in office for only five days." On the surface, one may receive the benefits of austerity, but in reality, this fact gives public officials a negative psychological reaction. The harm is deeper and greater.</p>
<p>We believe that if we want to reorganize finances today, we must (1) vigorously implement a budget and final accounting system. The budget and final accounting must be absolutely open and must be approved by the people. (2) Abolish all names such as secret fees and activity fees. (3) The accounting personnel of each agency must not be directly appointed by the主管長官 (zhuguanzhangguan), but should be appointed by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. (4) Correct the extravagant lifestyles of officials, strictly prevent them from engaging in corruption and embezzlement, and restrict their operation of speculative businesses to clarify politics and build a clean government. In other aspects, we should save all non-productive expenses and concentrate our efforts on construction projects. Only in this way can there be hope for financial reorganization. Layoffs and salary cuts are only minor aspects. We certainly hope that the government can clearly see the "autumn hair," but at the same time, we hope that it will not ignore the "cartload of firewood" that is in front of it.</p>

If the situation becomes urgent, the Authorities will order Minister Shigemitsu to return to China immediately. The Authorities have sent a final order to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Murai, ordering him to demand that the Chinese authorities disband the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and similar groups. This should be the primary condition for resolving the current Sino-Japanese dispute. The six warships that departed from the Wu naval port may arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. These ships carry 500 marines. Furthermore, there are 22 warships from Sasebo that have prepared everything and are awaiting orders to depart.

<h3 id="e74">Soviet Russia Announces New Five-Year Plan <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Increasing Production and Improving Technology</p>
<p>And Making Transportation Mechanized</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 22nd – The Russian government believes that the current Five-Year Plan has reached a stage where complete success can be achieved. Therefore, the Russian government has drafted another new Five-Year Plan, which was announced today in the form of a proposal. It will be submitted to the next Communist Party Congress. The plan states first that the existing industrial plan is nearing completion, signifying that Soviet Russia has established the foundation for its national economic transformation. Agriculture has transformed from a chaotic mix of individual holdings into large-scale, modern farming units, unparalleled by any farming system in the world. Lenin once asked, “In the struggle between social ownership and private ownership, who will win?” Now, this question has been fully answered: socialism has triumphed. Soviet Russia's work in eliminating the parasitic class has greatly increased national wealth, and the rate of this increase is unmatched by capitalist countries. There is no concern for unemployment, living standards are improving, and the cultural level of the working class is also advancing, as evidenced by the low mortality rate and high productivity, it is said. It then describes the procedures for the second Five-Year Plan, which is divided into three sections: (1) Increasing production; (2) Improving technical knowledge and efficiency; and (3) Supplying and distributing goods. The first section states that Soviet Russia's machine manufacturing must increase three to three and a half times compared to the current level. Electricity, which is 170 billion kilowatt-hours this year, must increase to 1 trillion. The production of kerosene should also triple, with a deadline of 1937 for completion. The production of non-ferrous metals, excluding iron, must increase to an amount sufficient to meet the needs of the people. The chemical industry must align with the progress of Soviet Russia's industry. Transportation must be completely transformed, with the construction of 15,000 miles of new railways. Attention must also be paid to air and waterway transportation. Small industries and the food industry must be reorganized to meet a demand three times greater than today's. Grain production, by the end of the second Five-Year Plan in 1937, must increase to 130 million metric tons. The second section elaborates on the importance of technological progress, pointing to it as a key element in solving Soviet Russia's cultural problems and developing socialism. The third section focuses on the supply and distribution of goods, stating that the left-wing theory of abolishing currency and restoring direct exchange is as unacceptable as the right-wing theory of utilizing small-scale private commerce, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e75">French Parliament Expresses Confidence in Government's Foreign Policy <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>No Concessions on Disarmament and Reparations</p>
<p>Reuter, Paris, 22nd – This afternoon, the Chamber of Deputies discussed French foreign policy, with a particular focus on reparations and disarmament. After a speech by French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government with 303 votes against 265, and rejected the motion of opposition proposed by Herriot. Later, a direct vote of confidence was held, and the government received a slight majority of votes. Laval stated that the experts in Basel recognized the need for deferred payments, but at the same time reserved this issue for the future, because Germany possesses very powerful economic facilities. The French government will not allow any treaties established by its predecessors to be abolished. Only if France's debts to others are also reduced can France acknowledge a reduction in reparations. The provisions of the Young Plan cannot be modified; the only thing that can be done is to alleviate the burden with a type of deferred payment plan. France has repeatedly made goodwill gestures in order to facilitate the establishment of a European alliance, but it cannot accept the position of an independent Germany voluntarily providing a solution. The faithful rules applicable to human relations should also apply to international relations. His agreement with British Prime Minister MacDonald on the reparations conference is only a matter of time, it is said. Laval then spoke about the issue of disarmament, stating that France's disarmament policy is in line with the League of Nations charter, but France is unwilling to accept temporary measures that could harm its security. France has established a model of disarmament in the last ten years, but is still willing to go further and propose concrete measures in order to realize the political conditions for immediate mutual assistance. If so, the practical procedures for disarmament can be easily implemented, it is said. Laval concluded by requesting an end to party strife. When he finished speaking and sat down, the assembly hall erupted in cheers.</p>

<p>Arms Convention Needs to Be Revised</p>
<p>Aerial Bombardment Should Be Prohibited</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 22nd – Germany will reiterate its call for universal disarmament at the upcoming disarmament conference. Germans firmly believe that this request is extremely legitimate. Germans even cite the words of famous politicians from the former Allied and Associated Powers and the League of Nations as proof. Germany believes that the arms convention drafted by the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference not only cannot achieve the goal of disarmament, but also risks promoting arms expansion. Therefore, Germany does not recognize this convention as the basis for future discussions on disarmament. This convention both stipulates equal armaments and completely omits the army reserve force. It is important to know that a trained reserve force is actually an element of modern warfare. Military experts such as General Foch and former French Minister of War Painlevé have made important statements on this. Any disarmament plan that disregards the reserve force is merely a formality. Furthermore, the convention uses the limitation of each country's army budget as a regulation to limit armaments. This is also a deceptive measure. There is also a major shortcoming, which is that the limitations on air warfare are extremely inadequate. Merely prohibiting the use of chemicals is still not enough to protect civilians. Therefore, the German representative is determined to request the prohibition of dropping bombs from the sky at the disarmament conference. According to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany cannot deploy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes, so it is extremely vulnerable to aerial attacks from France and Poland, without any ability to resist. For these various reasons, the German representative intends to strongly oppose this convention at the conference. According to political circles, this convention must be greatly modified before Germany can accept it, it is said.</p>

Troops that have been cut off and isolated from their base areas face the risk of annihilation unless they surrender, it is said. However, political circles here mostly do not believe these kinds of rumors and still seem to believe that the government will eventually quell the rebellion and stabilize the overall situation.

<h3 id="e83">Japanese Obtain Land Rights in Harbin <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Long-Standing Case Resolved at Once</p>
<p>Eastern Special Party Authorities Flatter Japan and Relinquish Rights</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The issue of real estate registration in the Special Zone has been a long-standing dispute between China and Japan. At the end of November last year, a certain newspaper in Harbin suddenly claimed that the Eastern Special land lease issue, which had been in dispute for nine years, had now come to an end. On the Chinese side, the Director of the Land Administration Bureau made a statement saying that the land issue had been resolved several years ago, and that the Japanese registration was actually an acceptance of China's claim. On the Japanese side, however, they claimed that the issue had only recently been resolved and was beneficial to foreigners, and that from now on, the Japanese could ensure their ownership of land in the Shitoudao Street area of Harbin and seek development along the Eastern Railway line. Outsiders naturally find it difficult to understand the truth of the matter. However, the Japanese have always disregarded the regulations promulgated by the Chinese authorities. Now, after the Northeast has been occupied, they suddenly eagerly change contracts. The reason for this is not difficult to imagine. Now, please allow me to describe the process of how this issue arose.</p>
<p>The Eastern Provinces Special Zone, formerly the Eastern Railway’s affiliated land, was initially formed when the Eastern Railway was built. Land along the railway line was occupied without compensation or purchased from the people at low prices, covering a very wide area. Thus, a railway-affiliated land was formed that was somewhat similar to a leased territory. Later, after the Changda Line south of Changchun was transferred to Japan, there were still 10,550 remaining, which equals 18,761.78 acres. The annual land revenue is about one million rubles. This type of land, formed within China, created all sorts of abnormal situations. After the overthrow of the Tsarist Russian government, our country recovered administrative power along the Eastern Railway line and established the Eastern Provinces Special Zone. It was necessary to recover these land rights. In July of the 12th year of the Republic of China (1923), the former Director of the Special Zone, Zhu Qinglan, together with the Garrison Commander of Binjiang, Zhang Huanxiang, formulated measures to take over the Eastern Railway Land Management Office, which were implemented on August 1st. The takeover was completed, and the Eastern Provinces Special Zone Land Administration Bureau was established the following day to inherit the tasks of the Eastern Railway Land Management Office.</p>
<p>However, the consulates of the countries in Harbin at the time were greatly dissatisfied with China's recovery of rights and filed protests one after another. As a result, the Eastern Railway Land Management Office was allowed to continue to exist, but its authority was reduced. At the same time, the Sino-Russian Conference opened in Beijing. The Russians expressed concessions on the land issue, so the influence of the Land Administration Bureau gradually increased. When the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement was concluded, the Chinese Eastern Railway became a purely commercial organization with no land rights outside the railway line. The Eastern Railway Land Management Office was thus effectively eliminated, and the Land Administration Bureau had full power over the land along the Eastern Railway line.</p>
<p>However, the Eight Stations issue occurred at the end of the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924). At that time, the Russian Director of the Eastern Railway, Ivanov, believed that the Eight Stations were necessary land for the Eastern Railway's operation and began to collect taxes in the area. The Chinese side, however, believed that the Russians had clearly given up their land rights in the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement and could not recognize this matter. The public also held fierce demonstrations to urge the government. As a result, on January 1, 1925, the Chinese government announced real estate regulations in the Special Zone, stating that any contract not registered with the local court would have no legal effect. This led to protests from foreign consuls, claiming that this regulation hindered the rights of foreigners not subject to Chinese jurisdiction. The Japanese side advocated this even more strongly. At that time, the Japanese Consul-General, Ayasuke Eiji, tried various methods to abolish this registration measure. The Chinese side, on the one hand, replied to the other side, stating that real estate registration was not a litigation matter and had nothing to do with consular jurisdiction. On the other hand, the Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhang Huanxiang, issued Proclamation No. 50 on December 15, 1926, and Proclamation No. 51 on December 20 of the same month to show that the matter was inevitable.</p>
<p>The main points of these two proclamations were roughly to abolish the old Russian contracts and register again, issuing Chinese contracts. If these procedures were not followed, all transfers and name changes would be invalid. Ten articles of simplified rental regulations were also formulated, stipulating that property owners must fulfill the following obligations: (1) Abide by Chinese laws and local regulations; (2) The purpose of investment is limited to self-use and businesses operated by oneself; (3) Pay municipal taxes and not intentionally delay payment.</p>
<p>These regulations are the most lenient among the methods used by any country in the world to treat foreign residents. However, the Japanese and other foreign consuls still believed that they harmed their treaty interests and insisted on overturning them. Because there was no hope of resolution in Harbin, they notified their residents not to pay taxes and not to register, while the diplomatic corps in Beijing negotiated with the Zhang Zuolin government. (At that time, Zhang formed the Grand Marshal's Office in Beijing, and after Zhang's failure to leave the pass and the Huanggutun Incident, it was transferred back to local management.) In September 1928, the Japanese Consul-General in Harbin even used the saying "no taxation without representation" as a condition for Japanese residents to pay municipal taxes, and negotiated with our country to elect a committee to the municipal council as a prerequisite, thus intruding into the political sphere. The Japanese have completely achieved their goals in this section, but the land issue has not yet been resolved. When the outgoing Japanese Consul in Harbin, Yagi Motohachi, left office, he still considered this to be his greatest regret.</p>
<p>After the arrival of the new Japanese Consul, Ohashi Chuichi, the consuls of other countries no longer mentioned this land issue, but the Japanese Consul continued to work hard. After the September 18th Incident occurred last year, according to Japanese newspapers, he made the following remarks to the Japanese, announcing the results of the land issue: (1) The real estate registration regulations of the Eastern Provinces Special Zone of January 1925 do not apply to Japanese people. The transfer contract of real estate held by Japanese people does not need to go through the court and can be declared at the Land Administration Bureau. (2) Abolish Proclamation No. 50 and Proclamation No. 51 of December 1926. Japanese people only need to undergo a slight qualification review by the Chinese side to retain old properties and accept new properties. (3) Japan has de facto recognition of the Land Administration Bureau, which it has not recognized in the past.</p>
<p>These declarations are very inconsistent with what the Chinese side has claimed. The actual facts cannot be known, but the Japanese side congratulated each other, celebrating the solidification of property rights in the Shitoudao Street industry in Harbin. The Japanese have a lot of real estate in Shitoudao Street (the Toyo Colonization Company alone has more than 1,000 tsubo, which is about 34,000 square feet in Chinese measurements.)</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, as of December 28, 1931, there were 31 cases of Japanese people's Russian land deeds being exchanged for Chinese land deeds in the Land Administration Bureau. The distribution of owners is as follows: Toyo Colonization Company 19 cases, North Huic Electric Company 1 case, Land Construction Company 1 case, Far East Transportation Company 1 case, Eastern Provinces Industrial Company 1 case, Mitsui &amp; Co. 1 case, Harbin Bank 1 case, Kiue Store 1 case, Yokohama Specie Bank 3 cases, North Manchurian Development Company 2 cases, totaling 31 cases. (The Toyo Colonization Company actually has a lot of land in Korea and the three northeastern provinces.) It is heard that the South Manchuria Railway Company also plans to build a grand building on Shitoudao Street as a central organization for the Japanese. It will have four floors. The underground floor will be a large club composed of a dance hall, ice skating rink, indoor sports field, dining hall, and bar. The ground floor and the second floor will be shops and banks, and the third and fourth floors will be residences. If these buildings become a reality, they will greatly prosper Shitoudao Street. What we must pay attention to is that after the Japanese have obtained land rights, the various countries of France, England, America, and Italy will inevitably demand the same, and the land ownership in Harbin will fall into the hands of foreigners, and the danger is enormous.

<h3 id="e84">Guangdong Army Recovers Xinfeng on the Jiangxi Border <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Peng Dehuai's Forces Have Collapsed and Retreated</p>
<p>Ganzhou City Has Not Fallen</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Jiangxi communist bandits, taking advantage of the recent political instability and urgent foreign troubles, are attempting to make a show of force. The Zhu De and Mao Zedong divisions are engaging in large-scale activities, and the entire eastern and southern Jiangxi provinces have been ravaged. At the same time, the Guangdong province border defense has become strained. The Guangdong authorities have specially dispatched Li Yangjing's Third Army to Zhenzhe in eastern Jiangxi. The original troops in Dongjiang were the Second Army, Zhang Meixin's First Division, and the First and Second Independent Brigades. The newly added Third Army has two divisions, totaling five divisions and three independent regiments, which should be sufficient to deploy in the Chaozhou-Meizhou border area. After the Third Army was withdrawn to Beijiang, all Beijiang defense was entirely deployed by the First Army, Yu Hanmou's troops. The Second Division, Ye Zhao's troops, are stationed in the area of Shixing, Nanxiong, and Zhoutian. The First Division, Li Zhenqiu's troops, are stationed in the area of Shaoguan, Lechang, Yingde, and Wengyuan. Army Commander Yu Hanmou personally went to the front on the 19th to inspect the Beijiang defense. Xinfeng, above Nanxiong, is currently guarded by the First Independent Brigade, Fan Dexing's troops, and jointly defended with the Jiangxi Army, Ma Kun's Brigade, in Ganzhou. The recent Shanghai newspaper report that Ganzhou was captured by bandits on the 3rd of this month is a misrepresentation. We have received a telegram from Ma Kun proving it is inaccurate. However, Xinfeng City in southern Jiangxi did indeed fall once. The county was originally garrisoned by the Second Regiment, Liao Daoming's troops, dispatched by Fan Dexing's Brigade of the Guangdong Army. Later, due to the intensifying bandit forces, the regiment moved to the Dageng border, 30 miles outside Xinfeng City, for the convenience of communication. Xinfeng County was temporarily defended by more than 700 militiamen. Recently, the communist bandit Peng Dehuai's forces discovered that the city was empty and suddenly led more than 1,000 bandits to besiege Xinfeng County on the 13th of this month. The militiamen in the city were unable to resist and lost the city in the evening. On the 14th, Fan's Brigade heard the news and dispatched Liao Daoming's Regiment again to attack fiercely, and also dispatched a machine gun company to assist in the attack. They fought fiercely with the bandits for two days and nights. The communist bandits ran out of ammunition and abandoned the city and fled on the 16th. Liao's Regiment entered the city that morning to handle the aftermath. On the 17th, they reported the details of the recapture of Xinfeng to the Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army.

<h3 id="e85">Hubei Province Begins to Ban Opium <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hubei Province has been brewing an opium ban for a long time, and now a Opium Prohibition Committee has been established to be responsible for handling it. On the 22nd, the committee appointed special investigators for each county and city, and announced that it would be implemented from today. The proclamation stated that the harm of opium is worse than floods and beasts, and the central government has issued clear orders to ban it. However, because the Hubei and Hunan regions are close to Sichuan and Guizhou, there is an excessive amount of stockpiled goods. The procurement of these goods was before the opium ban, and the funds involved are of great financial importance to the region. Merchants petitioned the former Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for approval to sell off old goods within a limited time to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, and an office was set up to supervise the cleaning up in order to eliminate them as soon as possible. Except for the</p>

<p>transport and sale, which is responsible for the cleanup by the Hubei Special Tax Office, all prohibited planting and smoking should set up special management agencies, hoping to receive the effect of division of labor and cooperation. Now, the committee has been established in accordance with the order of the Hubei Provincial Government, and has still formulated various rules for the opium ban in accordance with the Opium Prohibition Law and submitted them to the Hubei Provincial Government for deliberation and approval. The methods are: (1) Absolutely prohibit the planting of opium seedlings to eliminate the roots. (2) Absolutely prohibit the smuggling, transport, and sale of drugs such as morphine, red and white pills, Gaogen, and heroin, in order to eliminate the root of the poison. (3) Absolutely prohibit young men and women from smoking. (4) All opium smokers should register with the opium prohibition agencies in each county and city in accordance with the regulations, and request the issuance of opium cessation licenses to quit smoking in stages. The opium cessation medicine should be purchased from licensed stores for verification. Those without a license are not allowed to purchase and smoke, and violators will be punished as contraband. (5) Places similar to opium dens that provide smoking are places that hide dirt and harbor criminals and have special chapters to strictly ban them. Those that have been established should immediately apply for registration, and only be allowed to reduce the number of places, not increase. (6) During the cleanup period, only licensed stores that have paid special taxes are allowed to sell opium cessation medicine. If there is private smuggling or smoking, once discovered, they will be punished according to the regulations. If people report and are arrested as a result, 40% of the fine will be used as a reward, 30% will be used as a bonus for cooperating personnel, and the remaining 30% will be submitted to the committee as opium prohibition funds. Opium is rampant throughout Hubei Province. The authorities have been taking a laissez-faire attitude in order to greedily collect taxes. Now that a special opium prohibition agency has been established, it seems that it will change to intervention from now on. (January 22)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Chen Diaoyuan Sends Personnel to Wuhu to Raise Funds <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Borrow 300,000 Yuan from Salt Merchants</p>
<p>And Also Dispatching 200,000 Yuan in Road Construction Bonds</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government owes at least 700,000 yuan in various party and government expenses for the past year. The income from land taxes and miscellaneous taxes in various counties has been almost cut off due to the impact of the floods. The salt surtax and collaborative funds promised by the central government (about 270,000 yuan per month) have not been allocated for both December of last year and January of this year. The expenses for Chen Diaoyuan's 46th Division, Yue Shengxuan's troops, the 55th Division, Ruan Zhaochang's troops, the 57th Division, Li Songshan's troops, and the garrison brigade (about 400,000 yuan per month) have also not been issued for two months. The need for funds is as urgent as fire. Liu Yumin, the director of the Finance Department, went to Beijing last time to demand the 500,000 yuan owed by the central government, but because no one was responsible in the Ministry of Finance, there were no results at all. He is still staying in Beijing. In view of this, Chen Diaoyuan specially sent Zuo Zonglian, the second section chief of the Finance Department, to Wuhu yesterday to contact the Salt Transportation Bureau, the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and the salt merchants to borrow 300,000 yuan using the surtax that should be allocated by the central government as collateral. He also dispatched 200,000 yuan in road construction bonds to salt ticket merchants and water vendors, with a deadline for payment to the treasury in order to meet the urgent needs. After Zuo arrived in Wuhu, he contacted all parties, but there were no concrete results. Because the silver market in Wuhu is extremely tight, it is difficult to raise funds. Even if there is a solution, it will take a considerable amount of time. It is heard that after Zuo finishes his business in Wuhu, he will also go to Bengbu to discuss borrowing funds with the salt merchants in northern Anhui. (January 21)</p>

<p>Telegrams from Various Groups Reinstating the Reputation of Commander Zhang</p>
<p>All Detained Personnel Also Released by Commander Zhang</p>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: Following an investigation into the Fengxian Incident by personnel dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Pacification Commissioner’s Office, as well as mediation by local gentry and Li Jiuling, a friend of Zhang Zhankui, groups in Fengxian telegraphed to reinstate the military reputation of the First Cavalry Division and undertook to provide supplies in accordance with provincial orders. Commander Zhang then released the detained personnel and returned the confiscated weapons. This mediation plan has now been implemented. The detained party committee member Dong Yujue, supervisory committee member Huang Tirun, battalion commander Zhu Dundian, and others have been released. The telegram issued by the Fengxian groups stated: "To the public across the nation: Having read recent reports in domestic newspapers alleging a mutiny and looting by the garrisoned Cavalry Division in Fengxian, as well as robberies of the Farmers' and Workers' Bank, shops, and residents, these are not the facts. The Third Cavalry Division has been stationed in Fengxian for several months, maintaining strict discipline, and enjoying harmonious relations with the local population. This incident originated from supply issues, which were exploited by malicious individuals to sow discord. The resulting misunderstanding was brewing for some time. The various rumors circulating outside are largely inaccurate. Both sides have now reached a mutual understanding, and past grievances have been completely resolved. All detained individuals have been released one after another, shaking hands and making amends as before. Furthermore, following this incident, personnel dispatched by high-level party and government agencies have thoroughly investigated the truth, which is now clear. All rumors have been dispelled. All agencies are now operating as usual, and the military and civilians are living in peace as before. In addition to reporting these circumstances to the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Provincial Government, and the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner and Superintendent, we specially telegraph this to inform the public across the nation. Respectfully submitted by all agencies and legal groups in Fengxian." With the dispatch of this telegram, the Fengxian Incident has now come to an end. (22nd)</p>

<p>Motorized Rowing Boat Violently Collides with Hantong Bridge: The Hantong Bridge in Yexie Town, 14th District, is a cement and steel bridge. Yesterday (the 22nd) at approximately 2:00 PM, a Xin Feng boat (a rowing boat equipped with a motor) was traveling from Songjiang to Nanqiao, passing the eastern pier of the bridge. The boat owner, A Mao, accelerated the motor and collided violently with the bridge. With a loud crash, the entire bridge shook, causing pedestrians on the bridge to scatter in fear. Fortunately, the bridge did not collapse, but the incident caused temporary disorder among the local residents. Officer Xuan Jinquan from the local police station detained the boat and the boat owner, A Mao, who will be sent to Songjiang today for further investigation. The district chief, Gu Wen, has reported the incident to the county government, requesting that personnel be sent to assess the extent of the damage and that motorized rowing boats be regulated to ensure the safety of passengers.</p>

<p>Merchants Oppose the Rectification of the Business Tax Law: After the County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the provincial government regarding the Jiangsu Province's rectification of business tax methods, which violated ministerial orders, a reply was received yesterday stating: "An investigation reveals that the business tax in this province has not been diligently handled by various bureaus, and declarations by shops have not been accurate. Therefore, a thorough rectification is necessary. The Changshu Chamber of Commerce's proposal to temporarily maintain the tax rate should be thoroughly rectified. Given the lack of proper business tax management, the Chamber of Commerce should consider the overall situation and assist in the rectification. Objections to the rectification methods are unwarranted. The request is denied." Yesterday (the 23rd) morning, the Chamber convened a general meeting of representatives from various industries, which resulted in the following: (1) Unanimous rejection of the Jiangsu Province's rectification of business tax methods. (2) A request to the Tax Bureau to postpone the collection of the third-term tax payment due to the current downturn in business. (3) A unanimous effort to prevent the Tax Bureau from directly investigating various businesses.</p>

<p>True Account of Robbery Now Clear: Hu Xianchu, a clerk at the Sensheng Soybean Cake and Cottonseed Shop outside the North Gate of Sanli Bridge, Wuxi, went to Shanghai to collect 1,950 yuan from the Yuanda Oil Firm. Upon returning to Wuxi, he claimed that the funds had been robbed by three bandits. It is now known that the truth of this case has been fully revealed. It turns out that the shop's manager, Wang Shufan, had sent Hu Xianchu to Shanghai to collect the funds on the 10th of this month. After collecting the money, Hu went to the exchange to trade and gamble, intending to profit from the principal. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and he lost all the funds. Because Hu had not returned to Wuxi after several days, manager Wang Shufan wrote to the Yuanda Oil Firm in Shanghai to inquire. The firm replied that Hu had collected the full amount on the 18th. After receiving the letter, Wang went to Shanghai the day before yesterday to search for Hu. He found Hu but did not mention the funds. They then took the night train back to Wuxi together. After getting off the train, Wang Shufan returned to the shop first, and Hu Xianchu then took a rickshaw back to the shop. Nearing the shop, Hu, with no other option, fabricated the story of the robbery. Upon learning the truth, Shufan was furious and wanted to send Hu to the authorities. However, after repeated pleas from Hu's relatives, Wang agreed to accept compensation of 500 yuan, with 300 yuan paid upfront and a promissory note for the remaining 100 yuan to be repaid on schedule.</p>
<p>The Case of Selling Japanese Coal Causes a Great Disturbance: Regarding the Yitaixing Coal Company's sale of Japanese coal, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association previously resolved to inquire with the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association about how to handle the Japanese coal and published a notice about the case. Later, the student association proposed a reconsideration, arguing that severe punishment was necessary. Yesterday, the committee re-resolved to confiscate all the coal found and impose a double penalty. After the meeting, it was noted that a reporter from the Xin Wuxi Bao, Zhou Hanru, had published a warning to the members of the Anti-Japanese Association, suggesting that Yitaixing had engaged in bribery but without naming specific individuals, which was considered detrimental to their reputation. It was decided that Zhou Hanru and Yan Yunqiao, the manager of Yitaixing Coal Company, should be brought to the meeting for questioning to clarify the truth. The prosecutor's office summoned Yan Yunqiao and Zhou Hanru to the Anti-Japanese Association that evening, where they were questioned severely. Yan Yunqiao claimed that the coal had already been sold to the Gansheng Silk Factory and had nothing to do with him, so there was no reason for bribery. Zhou Hanru said that she had heard it as a rumor and could not name anyone but hoped that all staff members would be clean. The final result was that Yao Xinchui and Li Xin'yan of the Anti-Japanese Association stated that a letter of proof from the Gansheng Silk Factory was needed before a resolution could be reached. As the meeting was adjourning, Zhou Hanru's rickshaw puller suddenly clashed with staff members of the Anti-Japanese Association, and a scuffle broke out, resulting in injuries on both sides. They were taken to the Public Security Bureau to examine the injuries and request legal action.</p>

<p>Mei Kun Ferry Runs Aground and Sinks: Hupu Meili in this county is an important town in the east of the county, and the market is quite lively. Recently, someone organized a Mei Kun ferry service, from Hupu Meili to Kunshan. On the 21st of this month, the company's Linfeng ferry was sailing from Kunshan to Changshu when it ran aground near Ayu Kou, close to the river. Because the tugboat was too heavy, the bottom of the boat hit a reef (some say it hit the bridge pier), causing a hole in the bottom. The passengers were very alarmed. The tugboat was cut, and the passengers were ferried ashore, but soon the ferry sank to the bottom. Fortunately, no passengers were injured. Later, the tugboat sailed two li away and landed the passengers ashore. They telegraphed the company to send another ferry to rescue them.</p>

<p>Strictly Prohibiting Racketeering: Huangtiangang, north of Jiangyin, is a vital thoroughfare connecting the Yangtze River to the interior. In recent years, due to the abolition of tariffs, unemployed vagrants have gathered in the port, colluding with a few corrupt officials to extort money from passing cargo ships under the guise of "pai dang" (wharf management). This was reported to the provincial government, which sent an investigator who confirmed the allegations. In addition to recording a major demerit for the officials involved, including Li Jialin, the director of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau (who has since been dismissed), and Zhu Tianqi, the district chief of the First District, County Magistrate Ma was ordered to expel the five ringleaders, Tang Lian, Jin Yuanlang, Huang Rongquan, Pan Kunlin, and Pan Lingeng, and to issue a public notice strictly prohibiting such racketeering. It was also proposed to properly manage the water gates and maintain navigation to Huangtiangang for approval. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Ma instructed the Public Security Bureau and the District Office to review the matter together with the party and government conversation meeting, and submit a report.</p>

The boat immediately sank. There were 76 officers and soldiers on board. Fortunately, the Daqing steamer was sailing upstream and rescued all of them. 50 people were sent to Lujinggang, and 26 were ferried to Changyinsha. On the 22nd, they crossed the river to Nantong. The Yingrui warship happened to be sailing from Jiangyin, and the officers and soldiers boarded it. Only a few rifles were taken from the boat; the rest of the military supplies could not be moved out. Before disembarking, 40 tons of coal were loaded. Currently, only the mast is visible above the water. Commander Ren of the boat is still on vacation. Commander Lin Yuanquan of the Yingrui warship has telegraphed the Naval Department and will send salvage engineers to work.</p>

<p>Pretending to Borrow a Name to Obtain Housing: The Runjin Bathhouse at the entrance of Baota Lane in this city was jointly established by Bu Rongshou and Hu Fengkui, residents from other regions. Recently, because they did not want to continue operating, they advertised for sale. However, Feng Shishun, who had previously served as a runner in the county government, colluded with Wang Zhihe and pretended to buy the property in the name of a certain director. They stated that the housing and business assets totaled 16,000 yuan and agreed to exchange the silver contract by the end of the 11th lunar month. If a breach of contract occurred, the breaching party would be fined 2,000 yuan as compensation. However, by the due date, Wang only made excuses and procrastinated. Until around the 20th of this month, he only paid 4,000 yuan and used words to drive away the contract. He started practicing that day, agreeing that after Director Mou reviewed the contract the next day, the remaining money would be paid in full. However, the next day, Wang avoided meeting, and Feng continued to make excuses. Until yesterday, when Bu negotiated with him, Feng first used Director Mou's name to intimidate him and then resorted to violence to suppress him. When the police intervened, he even wanted to insult the police. Many passersby were very dissatisfied, so he was taken to the Fifth Sub-bureau. The outcome of this case is still unknown.</p>
<p>Court Investigates Case of Two Police Captains: Zhang Peifu, the police captain of Gaoyou, and Xia Yuanhu, the captain of the water patrol, were previously suspected of colluding with bandits. The Department of Civil Affairs ordered Cheng Zhuang, the district chief of the Fifth Water Police District, to arrest them and send them to the province, where they were held in the company headquarters of the Special Service Camp. They were transferred to the Zhenjiang Local Court the other day. Yesterday, the prosecutor of the court interrogated them and ordered each to pay 200 yuan in cash and find a guarantor to be released pending investigation. However, it is said that Zhang Peifu was unwilling to accept this and submitted a document and a certificate of no crime to the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Foremen Surround Section Chief Demanding Payment: The Zhenjiang Dakoumen River Filling Project was contracted to Dong Yiming, Yan Guangzu, and others, who stipulated that the total amount of earthwork was 18,200 square meters, with a price of 1.5 yuan per square meter. According to the contract, 80% would be paid, and the remaining 20% would be kept as a deposit until the project was completed and inspected. Work began in March of last year, and over the past few months, a total of over 15,000 square meters of earthwork have been completed, and Dong and others have received payment for the earthwork on time from the Construction Department. Recently, Dong and others suddenly claimed that they wanted to dismiss the workers and insisted on receiving the 20% deposit. The Construction Department refused to allow this because it did not comply with the contract stipulations. Yesterday afternoon, Dong and others took advantage of Section Chief Xu of the Third Section of the department returning to his residence for lunch and led dozens of foremen and workers to surround Xu's residence, shouting loudly. Fortunately, the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau heard the news and sent many police officers to suppress them, and Dong and others dispersed.</p>

<p>Exhumation of Corpse to Investigate Filicide Case: A farmer named Wei Amao, whose son A Shun lived in Zhangliang Bridge, eight li from Xiaoshan, did not do his job, but gambled all day. On the night of the 18th, he asked his father for silver dollars, which angered the old father, who used a firewood stick to smash his son's head. Brain matter flowed out and he died. The next day, he was hastily coffined and buried in Yizhong. The neighbors nearby heard the news and reported it to the county government and the county court. On the 20th, the prosecutor arrived to exhume the corpse. He examined the head of the corpse, which was bloody and the brain matter flowing, and confirmed that he had been beaten to death. Wei Amao, who was over seventy years old, was not believed to have been so heavy-handed, so his brother Shunyang was summoned for questioning. However, because he had already fled, it was suspected that he had helped beat him. The neighbors were also summoned for questioning, but there was no definite evidence. After the examination, he returned to the court, filed a public prosecution, and issued a summons to his brother and parents for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education is currently investigating the general situation of public and private secondary schools nationwide and has re-issued a form to be distributed to education departments in all provinces and cities.</p>
<p>An investigation of secondary school names and distribution nationwide has been completed by the Ministry. A copy is being sent out to you for your information. Secondary education facilities in each province and city should be inspected to determine the state of affairs and adjust to the needs of the local environment, seeking adaptation and progress. Because the compilation of these statistics was rushed, the contents are too brief. A simplified survey form for public and private secondary schools in each province and city is being issued. Departments are to complete the forms according to the standards, and those that need to be forwarded to the subordinate schools for inquiry should be handled quickly. All forms must be completed and submitted to the Ministry before mid-March for further compilation and printing.</p>

It was also reported that the association issued an important declaration due to the suppression of the patriotic movement by the authorities of various schools. Furthermore, it sent letters to the principals of Qixiu and Shanghai Baptist University, requesting that they not obstruct the anti-Japanese work of the students in their schools, so as to facilitate its progress. The text of the documents is recorded below:</p>
<p>Important Declaration: Ever since the September 18th Incident occurred, all Chinese compatriots with even a little bit of courage have been filled with righteous indignation and have risen up to save themselves. We, the young students, as intellectuals, are inherently responsible for awakening the masses and leading the masses. Moreover, under the current circumstances, how can we stand by idly? Therefore, we have been running around, shouting, crying until our voices are hoarse. However, the authorities are willing to be lackeys of imperialism, sacrificing national sovereignty in exchange for the pleasure of imperialism and to achieve their personal goals of territorial division. The news of the neutralization of Jinzhou and the joint administration of Tianjin has broken the hearts of us students. Reaching this point, how can we continue to peacefully study and trust this traitorous government? Therefore, at the cost of any sacrifice, we have followed the principle that if the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? We have unanimously gone on strike to oppose treason and awaken our compatriots. We have endured great hardships. However, the government authorities continue to wantonly suppress our youth's anti-Japanese movement and add the evil name of "rioters." We have long understood their treachery and are not surprised. We only grieve for the difficult fate of our Chinese nation. However, the authorities of various schools have even become insane and willing to be the hawks and hounds of traitors, deliberately undermining the patriotic movement of the youth. They even arbitrarily accuse enthusiastic students and frequently expel them, wanting to place patriotic youth in dire straits. Alas! The aggression of imperialism has not ceased, and the running dogs of imperialism continue to roar. However, the educators who are supposed to guide our pure youth are willing to be running dogs of running dogs, directly undermining our youth. It is truly heartbreaking. This association, on behalf of more than 100,000 middle school students, solemnly declares: If there are those who are willing to act as hawks and hounds, undermining our youth's anti-Japanese national salvation movement, this association, in order to carry out its original purpose of anti-Japanese national salvation, will use all its strength to deal with these obstacles to anti-Japanese resistance, at the cost of any sacrifice. We hereby declare!</p>
<p>Letter to Two Schools: The association sent a letter to Qixiu and Shanghai Baptist University, which stated: "Respectfully addressed, Ever since Japan's invasion and occupation of the Northeast, several days have passed. They have spared no effort in damaging our sovereignty and slaughtering our people. However, our national border defense officials have adopted a policy of non-resistance, and important figures in the party-state have maintained a calm attitude. Furthermore, the general public, due to a lack of education and the oppression of the government, is unaware of the national crisis. Only a small number of students are running around, calling out, and working hard for national salvation. However, students are still in their learning years, and all aspects of their anti-Japanese work should be guided by the education community. Since anti-Japanese work is aimed at seeking happiness for the future of the nation, the education community should actively promote and guide it. However, according to investigations, we have heard that your principal has been obstructing the anti-Japanese work of the students in various ways and has even suggested that "if they continue to engage in anti-Japanese work, they will be expelled." This association bears the responsibility of leading middle school students in the entire city and cannot sit idly by. Therefore, we are writing to request that your principal immediately withdraw this order in order to facilitate the progress of anti-Japanese work.</p>

<h3 id="e103">New Plan for Chinese Children's Elementary School <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>During the last meeting of the Public Works Department Board of Directors, someone sent a letter suggesting that the funds that were not used last year for subsidizing Chinese private schools should be used to pay the rent for No. 138 Huade Road to establish a Chinese children's elementary school. However, the Director of Finance stated that the funds from last year should be returned next year and that the permission of the taxpayers would be required. Whether new plans could be carried out this year depended on the financial situation and would be considered later. One director supported the proposal, stating that this would allow the Huishan elementary school to be closed down and that the house on Huade Road was larger and more suitable. He believed that the Education Department could rent it immediately. Another director stated that if the house was rented and the funds were deducted from the budget for purchasing school sites, he would also support it. After discussion, it was publicly decided to approve the renting of the house. As for the issue of the Huishan site, it would be discussed again after the Board of Directors had investigated the income and expenditure situation of this year in detail.</p>

Jinan has played eight games in Group A, with five wins, two losses, and one draw, ranking second to Lincoln West. In reality, their hopes are even higher than those of the two teams. If they can maintain their indomitable spirit and remain undefeated, they will win this year's championship. Although Lux is not a formidable opponent, they must not be underestimated. There is a great taboo among military strategists, and everyone must strive and work hard. There is nothing in the world that cannot be accomplished. Jinan should also understand its superior situation and know how to handle it. However, it is unknown whether the weather will cooperate, allowing Shanghai fans to enjoy the skills of both sides.

<p>Mailing and Xiqing win big again</p>
<p>Fierce battles between Zhongqing and Xiqing next week</p>
<p>Xiqing volleyball was in its second week of competition yesterday. Seven groups clashed, and the audience was sparse. Among them, the battle between Zhongqing and Jiangwan in Group A was quite fierce. Jiangwan's ball skills have greatly improved and are incomparable to their first battle last week. Therefore, although Zhongqing is strong, it was difficult to win. As a result, although Zhongqing won consecutively in three games, the total score was 47 to 36, only a difference of eleven points. As for Mailing and Xiqing in Group A, they both had special performances and achieved excellent results.</p>
<p>There will be fierce battles in the following two weeks. Next Saturday (January 30), Zhongqing will fight Xiqing. In the last week (February 6), Zhongqing will fight Mailing. These three teams all have hopes for the championship and are unwilling to show weakness. Each is determined to win the championship. Moreover, since Zhongqing has won the championship for three consecutive years, the Mailing and Xiqing teams have long held a grudge. Therefore, this clash is bound to be fierce.

<h3 id="e118">Original Text of the Municipal Government's Protest Against the Incident of Japanese Residents Causing Trouble on North Sichuan Road <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul-General regarding the disturbance caused by the crowd at the Japanese Residents' General Assembly on the 20th along North Sichuan Road, where shops were smashed. The original text is copied below: Respectfully addressed, According to the report submitted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, at 1:00 PM on the 20th of this month, Japanese residents of this city held a general assembly at the Japanese Residents' Club on Peng Road in the Public Concession. Approximately one thousand people attended the meeting. After the meeting, they went to the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai and the Japanese Naval Landing Force to petition. While passing along North Sichuan Road, they caused disturbances along the way, smashing many shops and damaging the windows of tram number 125 and public buses in the concession. Upon reaching the Qiujiang Road intersection, they wantonly destroyed the glass windows of Chinese shops. It was not until after 6:00 PM that they dispersed on Dixiwei Road. At that time, the people of this city were filled with uncontrollable anger. Fortunately, the head of the district, along with the police team leader and police officers, exerted great efforts to suppress and persuade them, and no accidents occurred. The losses suffered by the various Chinese shops this time are extremely large. In view of this, regarding this illegal action by the Japanese residents, the Municipal Government has repeatedly sent letters to your Consul-General, requesting attention and effective prohibition. However, this time, the Japanese residents have again deliberately provoked trouble. At this time of serious crisis and heightened public sentiment, if misunderstandings occur, the responsibility will naturally rest with you. Therefore, we hereby lodge a protest, requesting that your Consul-General quickly investigate the perpetrators, punish them according to law, and strictly prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future. Regarding the amount of losses suffered by each shop, we will request compensation after a detailed investigation. A corresponding letter is hereby sent, requesting your attention to the matter and a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Situation of the Japanese Riot Case Remains Extremely Serious <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Discusses the Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Is Scheduled to Respond to the Japanese Protest Tomorrow</p>
<p>Our Country's Protest Has Not Yet Received a Response from the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Demands of the Japanese Residents' Assembly</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Shanghai, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that the municipal government is preparing to respond to the Japanese Consul-General's protest of the 21st tomorrow. The protest submitted by the municipal government on the 22nd has not yet received a response. He also stated that the message of condolence from the Japanese fleet commander was not accurate, but yesterday five more Japanese warships arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 PM and anchored in the Yangshupu River. Yesterday, due to the Japanese holding a residents' assembly, the Chinese concession authorities temporarily imposed martial law as a precaution. The situation remains extremely serious. The continued developments are recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Responding to the Japanese Protest Tomorrow Mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after traveling to Beijing some days prior. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited the municipal government at 3:00 PM yesterday to understand the progress of the Sino-Japanese negotiations. He was granted an audience and made the following statement: "During my trip to Beijing, I only reported to the central government about the deterioration of the situation between the Chinese and Japanese people in Shanghai. I did not engage in concrete discussions. As for the protest letter submitted by Japanese Consul-General Kuramatsu Murai on the 21st regarding the injury of five Japanese monks in Yinxiang Township on the 18th, we are currently preparing a response. Although the specific content of the response has not yet been determined, considering the four points raised by the Japanese consul, the first, second, and third points can generally be considered for handling. As for the fourth point, which demands the suppression of anti-Japanese movements and the disbandment of anti-Japanese organizations, since these organizations are formed by the people based on their spontaneous patriotic sincerity, as long as their actions are within a reasonable scope and do not hinder local order and tranquility, the government cannot suppress them with political power. Therefore, I stated when the Japanese Consul-General came to the municipal government to submit the protest letter that we have no right to suppress them. However, if their actions go beyond the bounds and are found to be illegal, hindering local order and tranquility, the municipal government will definitely impose sanctions according to the law." The response is scheduled to be delivered to the Japanese Consul-General next Monday (the 25th).</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul Has Not Yet Responded However, the protest letter submitted by our side on the 22nd has not yet received a reply as of this evening (the 23rd). However, when the Japanese Consul-General expressed his regret to me the other day (the 21st), he stated that he would strictly arrest the ronin who burned down the Sanyou Industrial Factory and severely punish them according to Japanese law.</p>
<p>The Ultimatum Is Not Accurate He continued by saying that in the past two days, Chinese and foreign newspapers have published that on Thursday night, Rear Admiral Shiozawa, commander of the First Japanese Fleet stationed in China, sent a message of condolence to me, demanding an immediate and satisfactory reply to the anti-Japanese movement by the Chinese and the assault on Japanese residents. I can solemnly declare that as of 4:00 PM today (the 23rd), that is, at the time of this meeting with you, I have not received such a document. Moreover, while diplomatic relations still exist, all interactions between China and Japan in Shanghai should be addressed on one side to the Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government and on the other to the Consul-General of the Japanese Consulate. Therefore, it is not reasonable for the Japanese fleet commander to send a letter directly to me.</p>
<p>We Will Adopt Legitimate Defense The reporter also asked what the Mayor thought if the Japanese disregarded everything and engaged in large-scale disturbances. He replied, "The central government has already issued orders that if anyone invades inland territory, we will adopt legitimate defense. Moreover, we have already made considerable preparations for maintaining security in Shanghai. If anything happens, we will take the necessary measures."</p>
<p>We Should Handle It Calmly However, regarding these provocative incidents by Japanese ronin, both the government and the people should handle them calmly in order to eliminate them invisibly. As the saying goes, "Seeing something strange and not being surprised, the strangeness will disappear by itself." The Japanese ronin fear nothing more than our disarray. If we alarm each other, we will give them an opportunity. However, when I (Wu, referring to himself) say handle it calmly, I do not mean that we should allow them to commit violence and disturbances. If they commit illegal violence and disturbances against us, we should sanction them through legitimate procedures.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Policy of Peace In short, the municipal government's policy for dealing with these disputes is to prioritize peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The Chinese Concession Has Always Cooperated After the Japanese ronin burned down the Sanyou Industrial Factory, various organizations requested that more military police be sent to assist the Municipal Council in maintaining local security. Mayor Wu stated yesterday that the municipal government has always cooperated with the Municipal Council in maintaining local security, but sending military police to the concession seems to be difficult in reality.</p>
<p>Strict Precautions in the Chinese Area The Chinese area police authorities also took very strict precautions yesterday. The Public Security Bureau had previously received an order from the Garrison Command, instructing them to strictly guard against it yesterday. Director Wen ordered all police officers in the five districts to be armed and dispatched. More than 100 police officers from the Second Police Platoon were sent to Zhabei to patrol very secretly to the Chinese area near Sichuan Road, Tiantong'an Road, Baoxing Road, Baoshan Road, and Jiangwan Road. The precautions were even more severe in this area. The Garrison Command also transferred a large number of troops to suppress the area. Although martial law was not announced at night, patrols were extremely secretive.</p>
<p>Martial Law in the Concession Yesterday The Public Concession authorities paid attention because Japanese people publicized that they would hold a residents' assembly at Peng Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Therefore, the Municipal Council specially notified 12 locations in the Concession, including the Central Gordon, Xinzha, Putuo Road, Jing'an Temple, Harbin, Hongkou, Huisi, Huishan, Dixiwei Road, and Yangshupu, to implement strict precautions and sent all Chinese and Western detectives to patrol outside. Red police vehicles were also driven to various important institutions to protect them.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents' Assembly The Japanese residents of Shanghai held a residents' assembly at the Japanese Club at 69 Peng Road at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Kuramatsu Murai, the Japanese Consul stationed in Shanghai, feared that ronin would secretly bring weapons and take action after the meeting. He specially joined the Japanese patrol officers of the Public Concession Police Department to inspect the residents' assembly venue. More than 1,500 Japanese people participated. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting. The atmosphere at the venue was unusually tense. Later, the Japanese Consul arrived at the meeting to explain that arson and burning down the Sanyou Company factory were quite inappropriate. If they acted freely, the incident would inevitably escalate. He hoped that they would not act without authorization, and those who violated this would be punished by the consul. Therefore, all the people accepted the Japanese consul's advice, but demanded that the consul should negotiate with the Chinese authorities to achieve a satisfactory result. The meeting finally adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Japanese Held a Memorial Service At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Japanese held a memorial service for Liangse Songshilang at the Japanese Temple on Zhapu Road, Hongkou. Various Japanese groups stationed in China sent wreaths and other gifts. The meeting closed at 3:00 PM. The funeral committee then loaded the coffin onto a car, and prepared 45 cars for the mourners to ride in. It was carried to the Japanese Cemetery at 722 Yokohama Road for cremation. The cremation was completed at 3:45 PM.</p>
<p>Seven Japanese Confessed According to an investigation by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, seven suspects who burned down the Eryou Company factory have confessed to the Japanese consulate. The list of their names is recorded below: ㈠ Guangcun Fangcang, 46 years old, resident of No. A-1, Haining Road, this city. ㈡ Hosoya Yuichiro, 31 years old, resident of No. A-10, Haining Road, this city. ㈢ Yuan Dingci, 32 years old, resident of No. 103, Qiujiang Road. ㈣ Guan Heng Taro, 28 years old, resident of Jiugengli, Peng Road. ㈤ Kinoshita Kanzo, 40 years old, resident of No. 1018, Zhan'anli, Wusong Road. ㈥ Mori Masanobu, 16 years old, resident of No. 2, Mingdaoli, Shiqing Road. ㈦ Kitatsuji Takuji, 23 years old, resident of No. 97, Doule'an Road. The above seven people were escorted back to Osaka by the Japanese consulate yesterday for legal punishment.</p>

<p>Japanese Official Expresses Deep Apologies to the Municipal Council According to news from the Municipal Council, regarding the incident that occurred last Wednesday morning near Ward Road between Japanese residents and Chinese patrol officers of the Municipal Council, which resulted in the death of one patrol officer and one Japanese resident, and several injuries on both sides, the chairman reported at the Municipal Council meeting on Wednesday that the Japanese Consul-General visited the bureau that afternoon and expressed his deep regret for the incident. He also stated that he would discuss compensation for the deceased and injured patrol officers with the chairman, and informed the chairman that he would take necessary measures to punish those who attacked the patrol officers. Japanese Director Fukushima also expressed regret over the incident and assured the board that the Japanese officials did not sympathize with the Japanese Youth League that incited the incident.</p>
<p>Japanese Do Not Wish to Invade the Neutral Concession According to the Zi Lin Bao, the first person to visit the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai yesterday morning was Major General Macnaghten, Chairman of the Municipal Council. It is reported that the discussions between Macnaghten and Japanese Consul-General Murai included Shiozawa's naval commander's declaration, but the results were not announced. Also, Macnaghten and Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, visited Commander Shiozawa together yesterday morning to discuss the so-called Japanese "Message of Condolence". Shiozawa said that he would not take any action in the concession without first notifying the Municipal Council authorities, and that the Japanese now want to stop anti-Japanese activities in Shanghai, and obtain a satisfactory reply from the Chinese authorities to the Japanese Consul-General's request. The Japanese do not wish to invade the neutrality of the Public Concession, or interfere with the Municipal Council's efforts to maintain the laws and regulations of the Concession.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Officer Responds Ambiguously to Foreign Media Representative According to the Da Mei Evening News, a representative of the Da Mei Evening News visited the Japanese Fleet Commander Shiozawa this morning (the 23rd). A certain military officer met with the representative on his behalf and stated that the Japanese hoped that the Chinese authorities would have a satisfactory response to Shiozawa's request made yesterday. If they did not comply with the request, the Japanese Navy would take appropriate direct action. When the representative asked what the so-called appropriate direct action meant, the officer did not answer, but said that the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai would not take extraordinary actions today.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Da Mei Evening News on Maintaining Peace in Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Its Root is Planted in the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>Intimidation Is of No Use</p>
<p>No Need to Increase Defensive Forces</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News editorial states that Shanghai does not need to increase the defensive forces of China and Japan. Increasing troops will not stop the incident, but will easily incite it. Tokyo views the recent Shanghai dispute as a local incident and orders local officials to resolve it. This move is appropriate, but the Navy Ministry's order to send warships to Shanghai is inconsistent with this attitude. Now it is not necessary to send marines to Shanghai as ordered by the Navy Ministry, and China does not need to send defensive forces to the Public Concession as requested by the Chinese Taxpayers Association. The protection of the Public Concession is the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Maintaining peace in Shanghai is extremely difficult today. If the existing law and order agencies are arbitrarily increased, we dare to believe that it will increase the harm that is being curbed. Therefore, armed Japanese soldiers or Chinese soldiers arriving in Shanghai is enough to provoke. The current situation requires a psychological response. If we show off our military strength, it may ignite a prairie fire, which is very worrying. The police of the Public Concession are now doing their best to fulfill their responsibilities. We sincerely hope that the negotiations between Chinese and Japanese officials will not further stir up resentment. Although this incident is local in nature, its roots are planted in the Liaoning case. Tokyo should not ignore this point. We dare not believe that the root cause is not mentioned, and it is said that the final result can be obtained by making a request. Moreover, this kind of request, aided by military intimidation, can be called an extremely risky means today. This newspaper has always disapproved of the methods used by Chinese people to boycott Japanese goods, but this is completely different from the Japanese request for "guaranteeing that Chinese groups or individuals will no longer have anti-Japanese movements in the future". As long as resentment exists, Chinese people will boycott Japan one day, which is beyond doubt. Intimidation is of no use, but will increase anger. Chinese and Japanese people must maintain peace in Shanghai. Anyone who violates the laws and regulations, regardless of their nationality, should be punished. However, the root cause of Chinese people's dislike of Japan and Japanese people is the actions of the Japanese in Manchuria. The effort to boycott Japanese goods is the real difficulty that troubles and frightens Japan, but as long as the reason for the boycott exists, it will be difficult to weaken it in the end.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Japanese Warships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Five Warships Came to Anchor in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Aircraft from Aircraft Carrier to Arrive This Morning</p>
<p>Since the Japanese conflict incident on North Sichuan Road occurred, the Japanese Navy Ministry has dispatched a large number of warships to Shanghai. This matter has already been</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, around 3:00 PM, Japanese warships began to arrive in Shanghai one after another, and 500 marines were also transported. The aircraft carrier can also arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is reported that there are also fighter planes that are directly loaded from merchant ships. The information obtained by the reporter's investigation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Destroyers Arrived First The warships dispatched to Shanghai by the Japanese Navy Ministry this time are four second-class destroyers: "Susuki," "Ogi," "Fuji," and "Kuzu." These ships came from Wu Naval Port and Sasebo. They were originally scheduled to enter the port yesterday morning, but due to fog on the sea, they were delayed until 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon before entering the Huangpu River. Commander Shiozawa of the Shanghai First Overseas Dispatch Fleet received the telegram early. Therefore, when the ships entered the port, he ordered them to be anchored in the Yangshupu River to await dispatch.</p>
<p>Cruiser Arrived Later The cruiser "Oi," which commanded the 15th Squadron's four destroyers, also departed from Wu Naval Port at the same time. However, because it was carrying a large number of 500 marines and the soldiers' ammunition, it was delayed until 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon before it was able to enter Wusong. Only because there were marines on board who had to disembark on land, when "Oi" arrived in Shanghai, it was ordered to dock at the Huishan Wharf.</p>
<p>Aircraft Carrier To Arrive Soon The aircraft carrier "Notoro" was originally dispatched to the Lushun area. It has now been reassigned to Shanghai. The aircraft carrier telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, saying that it had loaded a squadron of aircraft in Lushun on the 21st and was heading south, and was expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM today. The ship will first stop outside the mouth of Wusong.</p>
<p>Ten Warships Stationed in Shanghai The original Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai, "Ataka," "Hirado," "Tokiwa," and "Urakaze," are under the command of the First Overseas Dispatch Fleet. Now, a cruiser, an aircraft carrier, and four destroyers have been added, totaling ten ships. The Japanese Navy Ministry telegraphed that all ships arriving in Shanghai would be under the command of Rear Admiral Shiozawa. Yesterday, after the "Oi" and other ships arrived in Shanghai, Commander Shiozawa met with the captains of each ship to discuss their tasks. In the afternoon, he also sent marines to patrol the North Sichuan Road area. The soldiers, in rows of six or seven, or more than ten, were all wearing red cloth armbands on both sides of the Target Road, with our armed police seriously maintaining law and order.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Tokyo received by the Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai, in 1931, Japan's foreign trade (including colonies) totaled 117.9 million yuan in exports and 131.8 million yuan in imports, a decrease of 22% in exports and 21% in imports compared to the previous year.

<p>Tokyo, 23rd, Electric Communication Agency - The Spinning Industry Association in China convened a committee at 1:00 PM today and received a report from the Osaka Shipping Industry Association on the anti-Japanese situation. After various parties presented their opinions and negotiated countermeasures, they concluded that due to the changing situation, 50-60% of the spinning products in China were in stock and sales had completely stagnated, resulting in various financial difficulties. Although operations have been scaled back, it is difficult to maintain them. Therefore, when it is unavoidable, all spinning factories in Shanghai will be completely closed down.</p>

<p>Demanding the Maintenance of Security in the Concession</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation specially sent representatives Wang Zhaocheng and Chen Binghui to the Municipal Council at 11:00 AM yesterday to visit Director-General Fessenden and raise the following two points: 1) Can the Municipal Council guarantee that the Japanese will not commit the same violence in the concession in the future? 2) Is the security force maintained by the Municipal Council weak? If so, should citizens' volunteer corps be allowed to equip themselves with firearms and assist in armed assistance? Fessenden responded, the general idea of which was the same as the response to the North Sichuan Road representatives reported yesterday. The representatives then withdrew and decided to visit Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government again this morning to demand serious negotiations with Japan. Their petition read: "Submitting a petition for the Japanese riot in Shanghai, requesting negotiation. The association convened an emergency meeting yesterday and resolved to request the Municipal Government to conduct serious negotiations and to issue firearms to the volunteer corps for self-defense. Two committee members, Wang Zhaocheng and Chen Binghui, were specially appointed to submit a document to your office. It is really convenient to receive a meeting.

<p>Five Great Hopes</p>
<p>May the People of the Nation Unanimously Support Them</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association recently welcomed Mr. Xiong Bingsan. The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>(Above omitted) I, Xiling, have served society for fifteen or sixteen years. In the past, I lived a political life, too far removed from the common people, and did not know what was meant by the suffering of the people. Since handling a flood disaster in the fifth year of the Republic, I personally went down to investigate and only then did I understand the conditions of rural life and the past mistakes and sins of our political circles. I became indifferent to politics and resolutely put it aside, focusing on strength and social service. I thought that the people are the foundation of the country, and children are the foundation of the people. Moreover, those who have already grown up are fixed in their ways, whether good or bad, and cannot be improved. Only children are like a large, uncarved jade, a blank sheet of paper that has not been stained. As long as we put in some effort and teach them well, everyone can become a healthy citizen. This is such an important issue! So I started from this point. Taking advantage of the fact that there was a child welfare bureau in Peiping in the past, I took in disaster-stricken children in the disaster area. Over time, more and more were taken in, reaching over 20,000. The child welfare bureau could not accommodate them, so another place was opened to raise them. However, they only had food and clothing. After a few months, the disaster situation subsided, and their parents gradually came to take them home. There were still one or two thousand orphans without parents or support, and no one to claim them. Only then was the Xiangshan Child Welfare Institute established. After several years of operation, there were no results, which worried me greatly. After careful study, I realized that they were doing it as a bureaucratic formality, so it got worse and worse. I personally went down to run several factories and set up several schools. Although they were not very good, I was much more confident than before. It was only because of my research in recent years and the problems that arose with our institute that I gathered with you charitable people today. I have five hopes. The first is to unify the national child welfare organizations, sharing strengths and complementing weaknesses. We who run charitable undertakings all face economic difficulties. Even those who do not face economic difficulties find it difficult to do everything in the world well. For example, in our child welfare, all young children should be cared for. If the child is healthy and intelligent, there is naturally no problem. However, if we encounter disabled children (blind, deaf, mute, lame, or with congenital syphilis or lung disease or leprosy) or children with bad character, if we take them in, it will harm the majority of children. If we do not take them in, they will die of illness or commit crimes. This is greatly contrary to our child welfare principles. What can we do to remedy this? We must establish schools for blind children and various institutions for the disabled, as well as various specialized hospitals, to accommodate disabled children. We must establish reformatories and educational institutions to accommodate children with bad character. May I ask, can one organization do all these things? Therefore, I hope that the Chinese Child Welfare Association will take on this responsibility, unite all the national child welfare organizations and charitable organizations. When encountering the above-mentioned children, they should be sent to the respective specialized organizations for care. In this way, there will be no abandoned children, and we can answer to our conscience in child welfare. This is the first hope.</p>
<p>The second is to use new scientific knowledge to improve China's early childhood education. China's great illnesses are poverty and ignorance. Of course, the poor do not have the opportunity for education, and the rich often do not know the methods of education, either being too strict or too lenient. Or else, they indulge in opium, mahjong, and theater, only knowing how to live the life of the rich, not knowing that they are creating a bad environment for their children. May I ask, are they qualified to talk about education? Some also send their children to school, but only at the primary school age of six or seven. Regardless of the quality of primary school education, early childhood education is simply not mentioned. Moreover, a child's intelligence is greatly related to their physical health. Some children suffer from bedwetting and are extremely dull, disliked by everyone. Later, after their illness was cured, they became smarter day by day. It can be seen that physical health is closely related to intelligence, and children not getting proper recreation will also hinder their physical health. These are all things that I have recently investigated. I know deeply that the Chinese Child Welfare Association focuses on children's education, not just on rescuing poor children, but also on carefully studying the educational methods for rich children. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese Child Welfare Association will take on this responsibility, unite specialized child welfare talents, and use new scientific knowledge to improve this early childhood education. This is my second hope.</p>
<p>The third is to establish nanny schools to train specialized child welfare personnel. There used to be a saying in China that one should learn how to raise a child before marrying. It can be seen that we Chinese do not pay attention to the way to nurture children. Once we have children, we simply follow what others say and let them grow up on their own. The poor need not be mentioned. Just talking about the rich, as soon as they have a child, they hire a wet nurse, not knowing that the wet nurse is always making things difficult for the employer, often threatening to quit. Does she have the knowledge to raise children? It is just that there is a lack of such talent, so they have to make do. I plan to set up a kindergarten, and there are two problems. One is the age requirement. The children in the kindergarten start at the age of four. However, the four-year-old children who are taken in are all malnourished and cannot attend classes. We must first raise their bodies before we can talk about it. After they are raised well, it will take at least a year and a half, which exceeds the age limit. To solve this problem, we must also set up a Montessori school, taking in children from two or three years old, and first putting them in the Montessori school to condition their bodies. After they are raised well, they can attend kindergarten classes. This does not delay their time. The other problem is the nanny. If we set up a Montessori school, we must have a nanny. However, there is no such talent in the old society, and the new scholars have not trained this specialist. What can we do? So I called my daughter to Columbia University in the United States to specialize in child welfare issues. Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, so I did an experiment and set up a nanny class to cultivate specialized talents, and set up a Montessori school and a kindergarten, each one, as a place for practical practice to temporarily take in young children. Their families are all very good, because of various problems, they cannot maintain their current living conditions, and many of their mothers are educated. I thought of a way to take in their children and called their mothers to be nannies, giving them wages as appropriate, for a period of one year. Sometimes I call the students in the training class to serve and practice, freeing up her body to train in the class. If there are more of these talents, they can be assigned to various places to serve. I hope that the Chinese Child Welfare Association will take on this responsibility, find specialized nanny talents, research specialized methods for teaching and educating young children, and contribute to society. This is my third hope.</p>
<p>(Right) Mr. Wu Weide, Director-General of the Chinese Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>(Middle) Mr. Xiong Xiling</p>
<p>(Left) Dr. Hu Xuanming, Executive Committee Member of the Chinese Child Welfare Association. The fourth is to convene a national child welfare conference every year. It is not that things are difficult to handle, but that talent is hard to come by. It is not that there are no truly noble specialized talents, but that it is really because of economic difficulties that we cannot afford to hire them. For example, my Xiangshan Child Welfare Institute used to focus on crafts, so we opened several factories, allowing them to learn crafts according to their interests. But we must give them a general knowledge, so we opened several classes of schools, with primary, senior primary, and junior high school levels. Later, we saw that they were very excellent and could not be buried, so we opened a senior high school level for them to go to college. Later, we saw that the graduating students had very good results and should go to university. We were limited by economic reality and could not afford to open it, and we could not bear to hinder their progress, so we discussed with the Xiangshan Agricultural and Industrial Bank, asking them to lend money to the students for university expenses, providing them with a university degree, and the compensation they received after graduation must be excellent, and then repay the principal. This method does not lose money for the bank, and the students are not wronged. There are already several who have entered university. However, running a class of schools, no matter how many students there are, hiring teachers, opening classrooms, and purchasing all educational supplies, are all indispensable. Calculating it, there must be two classes of junior high school for a class of senior high school, and two classes of senior primary school for a class of junior high school to be able to go to school. Our institute often has students who are not enough to advance to the next grade. Previously, the Chinese Child Welfare Association sent ten students, and now their level is very good. If the national child welfare organizations can unite, sending the students of this school to that school can save the difficulty of opening classes and avoid the situation of vacancies, and can also exchange knowledge. In the future, the child welfare cause will naturally flourish. We plan to imitate the methods of the National Chamber of Commerce and the National Education Association, convene a national conference, and hold it in various places in turn, which can be used to investigate the child welfare organizations in each place and mutually seek improvement. This is my fourth hope.</p>
<p>The fifth is to arouse social sympathy and attract public attention. Last year, the Chinese Child Welfare Association submitted a request to the National Government to approve April 4th as Children's Day, and the Ministry of Education issued a notice to all schools to hold celebrations. This year, on April 4th, celebrations should be held to expand publicity. But this publicity has two meanings. One is to let the social public understand the importance of the child welfare cause, and everyone should rise up, focus on studying how to teach and how to raise children, and give practical support to us. The other is to imitate the method of the American Golden Rule Day (on the American Golden Rule Day, donations are made for poor children all over the country, also known as Children's Happiness Day). We can imitate this and ask all the charitable people in the country to do their best to donate and contribute to this righteous cause. This is my fifth hope. (Below omitted)</p>

<p>"Swallow" Brand Condensed Milk to be Marketed in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Jiagan, a former teacher at Zhejiang Provincial Senior High School, and Mr. Xu Kangzu, a technician at the Zhejiang Construction Department, spent two and a half years inventing a vacuum milk condensing machine. Its special feature is that the condenser in the machine is specially purchased and is different from those manufactured in various countries. It can completely extract the fishy smell from the milk, so the condensed milk produced has a very fresh taste and no fishy smell. The vacuum milk condensing machine is a single-effect type, first created by the American Gail Borden in 1853. Since then, the condensed milk industry has flourished and the demand has increased day by day. Although our country has a great need, there are no factories or machines to manufacture it, and the benefits flow out, exceeding five million yuan per year. Recently, Messrs. Xiao and Zhang Xiongfei have raised funds to establish the West Lake Condensed Milk Co., Ltd. The factory is located outside Qiantang Gate in Hangzhou, and the cattle farm is located in Xiyancang, Haining County, with more than 1,000 acres of pasture and 200 dairy cows. It is said that since the product was launched, it has been well received by the society, especially in the counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. Recently, Messrs. Yu and Tang organized Shenchang Huahang to manage the company's "Swallow" brand condensed milk and market it in Shanghai. It is said that major pharmacies, Guanshengyuan, and other food merchants and stores all sell it.</p>

<p>His Wife Was Unwilling and Shouted "Thieves!"</p>
<p>Shot in the Right Thigh by Thieves</p>
<p>Zhou Fugen, a 58-year-old local farmer living in a bungalow in Zhou's house, Panxin Road, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, and his wife, Yuan, 44 years old, started their business through diligence and thrift and had a little property, which attracted the covetousness of bandits. At 7:30 last night, eight bandits suddenly came, three of whom were armed with pistols, threatening and intimidating the victim. At first, Zhou said he had no money and begged for forgiveness, but the bandits did not believe him and tried to kidnap his son. Zhou was extremely frightened and immediately pointed out the location of the hidden silver. All gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and other items, estimated to be worth about 3,000 yuan, and a deed, worth about 6,000 taels of land, were looted after ransacking the boxes. When the bandits were about to leave, Yuan was unwilling and shouted "Thieves!" repeatedly. Fearing that the patrolmen would hear the alarm, one bandit turned back and fired a shot, hitting Yuan's right thigh. The bullet went through, and blood flowed like a stream. The bandits then swaggered away. Later, someone reported to patrolman No. 236, who arrived at the scene, but the bandits had already left. They had to send the injured woman to Renji Hospital for treatment. The victim Zhou Fugen issued a loss report and reported to the Shanzhong Road Police Station for arrest.</p>

At that time, when Hui Ersheng saw the detectives coming, he said to his wife, "The police are here to arrest me!" and ordered the Western detectives to enter through the back door. Then he turned around and took poison himself, and there was an empty bottle of medicine on his table. When his wife came forward to ask, Hui said goodbye to his wife, and then became dizzy. The Western detectives sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, prosecutor of the First Special District Court, and forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Liu Zhuang arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to the wife's statement, Guo determined that the deceased, Russian Hui Ersheng, had died of poisoning. The body was handed over to his wife to collect the coffin for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Accepting the Manufacturing of Garbage Cans for the Entire French Concession <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>A Case of Fraudulent Acquisition of Property by Issuing Bad Checks Occurs</p>
<p>Wu Shaowu yesterday extended to Lawyers Xichang and Huang Han as agents, prosecuted Zhu Kongyang, the owner of the Fuyu Company, in the Second Special District Court for issuing bad checks, frauding property, requesting legal punishment, and incidental civil lawsuit. It is briefly stated that the defendant falsely claimed on August 26 of last year that he had received an order from the French Municipal Council and the French Consul General to handle the garbage cans for the entire French Concession, and entrusted the plaintiff to contract for the manufacture of iron cans, setting up a contract where each can would cost three yuan and two corners of foreign currency, and the delivery time was limited. The defendant also borrowed 1,000 yuan of foreign currency from the plaintiff on November 11 of the same year in the name of establishing the company, with a loan note as proof. The plaintiff believed it was true and delivered 3,132 iron cans, costing 10,022 yuan and four corners of foreign currency, receiving only 2,446 yuan in cash, with a net debt of 7,576 yuan and four corners of foreign currency. The defendant issued two checks dated October 27 and November 3, totaling 2,000 yuan of foreign currency. Upon expiration, there was no money to collect. Because of the contractual relationship, the plaintiff continued to manufacture iron cans, with 3,800 iron cans currently in stock, valued at 8,960 yuan of foreign currency. This item of iron cans is a special commodity, which cannot be used for other purposes and is virtually useless. The defendant defrauded people into believing the fraud and took property. The defendant's fraud of issuing bad checks and violating Article 136 of the Bill Law. Therefore, the plaintiff is requesting legal punishment and recovering 17,536 yuan and four corners of foreign currency. The defendant Zhu Kongyang admitted that it was because the company was attacked and there was no money to pay for a while. All the money collected was deposited in the bank and there was evidence to prove it. He requested a postponement to submit the evidence. Judge Wu instructed Zhu to pay 10,000 yuan in silver and be released on bail to await continued interrogation on the adjourned date.</p>

<p>Fifty Dollars and a Coat Demanded</p>
<p>Repeated Telephone Calls to Demand Remaining Money</p>
<p>Police Arrest Three Suspects</p>
<p>Yu Zhengmou, a Taixing native residing at No. 14 Baoding Road and employed as a foreman at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, received a threatening letter from a criminal gang between the 9th and 18th of this month, demanding 1,000 dollars. He reported the matter to the Huishan Police Station. The police chief ordered detectives Qi Mengqing and Cai Zhitian to arrest Xu Jinshan, a Jiangbei native, at the Wuhua Yang Bottle Factory at No. 276 South Chengdu Road on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Xu confessed that his accomplice was Chen Hengtai (also from Jiangbei), who lived at No. 1224 Datong Road. The detectives secretly went to arrest Chen and also took a suspected Jiangbei woman, Wu Chen, into custody. They were detained separately and escorted to the First Special Court, High Division One, the next morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the case involved three criminals who suddenly arrived at the home of the plaintiff, Yu Zhengmou, around 6 p.m. on the 9th of this month. One of them had a gun and, under the pretext of discussing the termination of workers with Yu, claimed that the dismissed workers planned to take drastic measures, posing a threat to Yu's life, and demanded 1,000 dollars to settle the matter. Seeing the menacing attitude of the group, Yu agreed to give them 50 dollars as a mediation fee and handed over the money. As they left, the group forcibly took Yu's coat and fled. Around 1 p.m. on the 14th, Yu received two threatening letters by mail, instructing him to negotiate at the Changle Tea House on Fuzhou Road at 6 p.m. on the 16th. He went as agreed, but no one came to meet him. At 2 p.m. on the 18th, he received another letter signed "Song," as well as two phone calls urging him to pay the money. One call came from Apartment No. 9 on Jing'an Temple Road, which was found to be a telephone installed by a German named Kao Laotuo, but the location of the German's office could not be determined. The other call came from No. 276 South Chengdu Road, which was found to be the location of the Wuhua Glass Factory. The detectives rushed to the factory to investigate and found Xu Jinshan about to make another call to urge payment. They arrested him and, after interrogation, learned of Chen's whereabouts. They went with Xu to identify and arrest Chen and also learned that the mastermind behind the case was Wu Ruizhi, Chen's "old man," and that Wu Chen was his wife, so she was also arrested. Xu confessed at the police station that five people went to the plaintiff's house on the 9th of this month. Yu's coat has been recovered from the Xinfeng Pawnshop at No. 618 Xinzha Road. The case is requested to be adjourned for further investigation. The coat and threatening letters were presented as evidence. The plaintiff, Yu Zhengmou, submitted a report stating that on the afternoon of the 9th, he saw Xu Jinshan enter first, followed by Chen Hengtai, an unfamiliar criminal with a gun, who stood by the escalator. They told Yu that the matter could not be settled for less than 1,000 dollars, or the lives of Yu and his son would be at risk. When Yu pleaded for a reduction, they said the lowest amount was 500 dollars. Fearing a shooting, Yu agreed to pay 50 dollars first, and Chen Hengtai accompanied Yu's wife upstairs to collect the money. As they left, they snatched Yu's coat and left. The original stolen goods are presented. After questioning the defendants, Judge Shen Bingrong ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date. The coat was returned to its owner.</p>

<p>According to the Zhonghua News Agency, the San You Industrial Cooperative Workers' Union, the Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union of the Seventh District, and the Eleventh Branch of the Municipal Party Headquarters believe that when the Japanese caused trouble at the San You Industrial Cooperative in Yinxiang Port on the morning of the 20th, police officer Tian Runsheng died, causing the residents of Yinxiang Port to live in a state of terror.

<p>The Anti-Japanese Radical Association of this city sent a telegram to General Ma Zhanshan, saying: To Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Hailun, As the Japanese bandits deepen their aggression, Your Excellency is fighting the Japanese alone with an isolated army, fighting for the survival of the nation and preserving the glory of the country. All compatriots admire you. Having read the Shanghai newspapers, we know that Your Excellency is determined to take nationalism as a prerequisite, sacrifice everything, and fight the Japanese to the end. No matter how the enemy slanders you, it will not harm Your Excellency in the slightest. This Association believes that if Your Excellency is ever in a desperate situation, please enter the Pass and lead the patriotic and courageous children of the whole country to recover the lost territories of the three provinces. This Association will spare no effort and vow to be your support. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Radical Association respectfully kowtows.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Outrage of All Circles Over Japanese Riot <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of the Municipal Party Headquarters The Municipal Party Headquarters issued a declaration on the Japanese mob riot, stating: This time, Japanese rioters set fire to our Eryou Towel Factory, destroyed our stores along North Sichuan Road, and even destroyed police kiosks and injured police officers. If the Shanghai Chinese and foreign authorities do not impose severe sanctions and allow them to run rampant, then the riot on the 20th is just the beginning. If the Chinese and foreign authorities truly want to maintain local peace and order, they must not take the Japanese atrocities lightly as an occasional incident, but should be deeply vigilant and prevent the recurrence of the Tianjin incident in Shanghai. If the Japanese are given another opportunity to sabotage, then the suffering we will endure will be even greater than in Tianjin, and the impact will not only be on the Chinese side, but also on the foreign residents and the Sino-foreign trade of tens of millions of dollars, which will also suffer. Therefore, for the common interests of China and the world, we sincerely hope that the Shanghai Chinese and foreign authorities will actively work together to find the most effective means of restraint. Anti-Japanese national salvation is our only way out today. No matter what the situation, we must persevere. All our comrades and compatriots should rise up and fight to the death to eradicate the violent Japan that disrupts world peace. This declaration is hereby made for your information.</p>
<p>County Party Headquarters The Shanghai County Party Headquarters and the County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association submitted a report to the Central Government on this case, stating: On the 20th of this month, Japanese residents set fire to the Eryou Industrial Cooperative Factory, killed and injured many Chinese police officers of the First Special District Municipal Council, and destroyed countless stores along North Sichuan Road. This Association has witnessed and heard of this and is deeply saddened. Since the September 18th Incident, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places have successively been harassed by the Japanese. Their intention is clearly to deliberately provoke trouble, but our government has ultimately failed to provide adequate protection and has tolerated the situation, leading to the huge disaster of factory burning and murder. Moreover, this incident occurred within the concession area protected by foreigners, so it is difficult to escape unscathed, let alone other areas. This Association hates the barbarity of the Japanese and mourns the humiliation of the Chinese people. As long as the Japanese are in our territory, the Chinese people will not have peace. Therefore, we hereby request your Association to immediately declare the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan and order Japanese residents to leave the country to prevent future troubles and protect the people. This is for the convenience of the Party.</p>
<p>Telegram of the Civil Diplomacy Support Association The Chinese Civil Diplomacy Support Association sent a telegram to the volunteer armies, stating: To the Volunteer Armies of Shanghai, Since the Liaoning Incident, in just a few months, the entire Northeast Three Provinces have been completely under the iron heel of the violent Japanese. To this day, they still have insatiable ambitions. On the one hand, they are using force to attack Jehol and, on the other hand, they are instigating Japanese residents to riot arbitrarily in various places in order to achieve the second step of aggression. For example, in the Shanghai Incident on January 20th, the Japanese brutally killed our compatriots and destroyed our shops on North Sichuan Road. Not only did the Japanese Consul not take appropriate action to stop them, but now he has greatly increased the number of warships, fully loaded with the army, gathering on the Huangpu River, with the intention of protecting the Japanese residents who committed the atrocities. The lives and property of our citizens in Shanghai are in imminent danger. It is hoped that the Volunteer Armies in Shanghai will uphold their ambition to defend the country and protect the people, take strict precautions to curb their ambitions, and make proper preparations for armed resistance. The crisis is imminent, and the responsibility is heavy. We hope that you will act righteously in this matter.</p>
<p>Petition of the District Branch The 25th District Branch of the Citizens' Union submitted a document to Mayor Wu and Commander Dai, stating: Re: Japanese rioters relying on violence to injure people and destroy stores, requesting serious negotiations. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, 500 to 600 Japanese rioters suddenly appeared on North Sichuan Road and, without cause, relied on violence to injure people, destroy stores, disrupt public order, resist arrest, and engage in various illegal activities, as detailed in the newspapers. This Association believes that this matter is of utmost importance, and we cannot shirk our responsibility. Therefore, we convened a general meeting on the 21st and resolved four points: 1. Compensation for losses; 2. The Japanese Consulate should be ordered to issue a written apology to each store; 3. Troops should be dispatched as soon as possible to provide protection; 4. Guns should be issued to our volunteer armies immediately. In addition to reporting the above four points to the Municipal Council of the Concession, we hereby submit them to your Excellency, requesting you to conduct serious negotiations and strive for them in accordance with reason. We hope that you will receive us and not treat this as an empty letter. This is for your benefit. [Signed] Wu, Mayor of Shanghai Municipal Government, Dai, Garrison Commander.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Industrial Labor Union The Shanghai Industrial Labor Union issued a declaration on the Japanese mob riot, stating: Since the Jinan Incident, Japanese imperialism has been advancing step by step, and the Northeast Three Provinces have been completely plundered. Recently, they have become even more aggressive, instigating rioters to harass our inland areas. North China is in danger, and riots, arson, and killings by the Japanese have successively occurred in Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. Our government has repeatedly maintained calm, causing the violent bandits to become even more unscrupulous. On the 20th of this month, they rioted again in the North Sichuan Road and Yinxiang Township areas of Shanghai, burning down the Eryou Factory and shooting and killing Chinese police officers. Alas, our beautiful land of China has been brutally ravaged. If our compatriots of all circles throughout the country do not urgently seek resistance, then our land, lives, and property will not be protected. We Chinese people have completely lost hope in what we relied on the League of Nations in the past. The so-called procrastination and waiting only makes the violent Japanese even more rampant. For the present plan, the only thing we can do is for our compatriots of all circles to unite, organize volunteer armies, and demand that the government issue weapons to resist. We also request that the government severely punish officials who have lost territory and humiliated the country, hold them responsible for burning the Eryou Factory and shooting and killing Chinese police officers, order them to punish the murderers, pay compensation, and apologize, and ensure that the same incident does not happen again in the future. To achieve this goal, this Association will lead the workers under its jurisdiction as a support. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Volunteer Armies Deployed for Defense <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Volunteer Army of the Municipal Joint Association The Volunteer Army Committees of the 17th, 20th, and 28th Districts of the Municipal Joint Association, together with the Volunteer Army Committee of the 25th District, issued an emergency order yesterday, ordering 200 to 300 volunteer soldiers from the three districts to be deployed in plain clothes to assist the police in protecting public order. They chose suitable locations to establish temporary offices, created temporary symbols and passwords, and organized in an orderly manner. At 5:30, the order to withdraw the defenses was issued.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Volunteer Army More than 700 members of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Corps were fully deployed yesterday to assist the military and police in maintaining public order. The corps was divided into three major teams: patrol, basic, and transportation. The patrol team had 400 people, divided into 40 small teams, rotating patrols in the area where North Sichuan Road, Qijiang Road, and Baoxing Road intersect, and in the Zhabei area. The basic team had more than 200 people, staying at the corps headquarters, waiting for deployment. The transportation team had 50 people, using private cars to transmit messages. The corps commander, Zhang Kechang, personally directed everything at the headquarters, and the organization was extremely strict.</p>
<p>Lizhi Society Volunteer Army In view of the serious situation in Zhabei last night, and fearing that Japanese rioters would endanger the Chinese community, Zhou Zhengfan, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Lizhi Society Volunteer Army in this city, issued an emergency order, immediately gathering 80 armed members, all holding wooden sticks and bayonets, and led by instructor Deng Tiezhi to secretly deploy sentries at the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions on North Sichuan Road and organize temporary patrol teams to provide protection. The society's spirit was full, and its discipline was excellent.</p>

<p>Joint Proclamation by Commander Dai and Mayor Wu</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji and Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng jointly issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: Proclamation Regarding Public Order: Since the Northeast Incident, the patriotic people of this city have been aroused by righteous indignation and have often held parades and demonstrations. However, communists and reactionaries have often been mixed in, resulting in illegal and excessive actions, which have been seen repeatedly. The Public Security, Social Affairs, and Education Bureaus have been ordered to provide appropriate guidance and suppress them. According to confidential reports, the communists and reactionaries are still active these days, attempting to use the power of the masses to incite chaos. As the commander and mayor, we have the important responsibility of maintaining local public order, and we cannot shirk our responsibility. Therefore, we reiterate the ban. If there are lawless elements who disregard local public order and plot to cause disturbance, we will definitely enforce the law and will not forgive them. All our patriotic people must not blindly follow them, lest they fall into the clutches of the law. Proclamation is hereby issued. All must abide by it.</p>

<p>Chinese National Salvation Association In order to assist the people's volunteer army in the Northeast, the Chinese National Salvation Association convened a joint meeting of its guiding committee and executive and supervisory committee yesterday. More than ten people, including Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Shang Mujang, Chu Huizong, Chen Kunshan, Ying Xiqi, and Liu Renhang, attended. Liu Jianggong and others, representatives of the people's volunteer army in the Northeast, also attended the meeting.

Their voices were full of tears, and the whole audience was moved. Then there were speeches and proposals by Shang Mujang, Chen Kunshan, Ying Xiqi, and others. At that time, three key items were resolved: 1. First investigate the names and locations of various national salvation groups in Shanghai; 2. Publicly recommend Mr. Wang Yiting to invite representatives from each group to a joint meeting in his private capacity to discuss practical assistance measures; 3. Representatives of the people's volunteer army in the Northeast will submit a written report on the course of the battle and the various situations of being oppressed to the government, on the one hand, and promote it to the inside and outside of the country as much as possible, so that patriotic people from all walks of life can understand the truth.

<h3 id="e150">Declaration of the Shanghai Municipal Local Self-Government Promotion Association <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Third Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Self-Government Promotion Association held its third preparatory meeting yesterday. Wang Binyan, Ling Zhibin, Chen Yafu, Yang Xinzheng, and other seven people attended. The following four items were resolved: 1. The revised articles of association were approved; 2. Joining the National Local Self-Government Promotion Association and sending personnel to negotiate; 3. Designating the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce as the association's address; 4. The association's declaration was revised and approved for publication. The declaration is as follows: Shanghai is the key transportation hub of the Yangtze River and the sea, and the meeting place of Chinese and foreigners. Cultural exchange is constant, and the people are educated. The cause of local self-government was already roughly established in the late Qing Dynasty. After the promulgation of the municipal and township systems in the early Republic of China, people of insight struggled to manage it, and there were considerable achievements. Although the people's administration was destroyed and replaced by official administration, the local people were still able to supervise the government and assist in the process, thereby achieving results. For example, in road construction, the construction of Xuxu Road and Xietu Road in southern Shanghai, the construction of Jungong Road, Songhu Road, and Xiangyin Road in northern Shanghai, and the construction of the Tanggong Bureau Road in Pudong, and the planning of various roads by the Transportation Bureau in Baoshan, are all visible to the eye. Other undertakings also have prototypes. When self-government was restored in June of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, public opinion was revived and people's administration became more prominent. In short, allowing local people to handle local affairs prevents public sentiment from being blocked, and designs are easily promoted. This is the clear and effective verification of this. However, the world is constantly progressing, and nothing can be perfected without changing. Shanghai and Baoshan are located adjacent to each other, and only by working together can we achieve twice the result with half the effort. If the city and townships each govern their own affairs, the situation will be narrow and the financial resources will be weak, how can we compete with the prosperous concession? Therefore, the demand to establish the Songhu Special Municipality has been rising in the newspapers, and people of insight should be able to recall it. The result of the appeal was only the establishment of the Songhu Municipal Administration Office, which did not fully meet the expectations of the people. In the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai. In July of the same year, the city-county zoning was determined. In June of the following year, the original seventeen municipalities and townships in Shanghai were merged under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government and municipal commissioners were appointed to assist in governance. The people of Shanghai yearned for proper governance, believing that their wishes could be fulfilled. In the future, actively developing construction and opening up port affairs could complete the plan of General Sun Yat-sen's Great Shanghai. However, in recent years, internal strife has not ceased, and municipal administration has been affected by it. Public opinion has not been expressed, and there are still obstacles, which is an undeniable fact that the people of Shanghai have heard and seen. Now that the political system has been reformed to jointly relieve the national crisis, the government allows the people freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. Therefore, the repressed public sentiment of several years has been fully expressed at once, and mass organizations are emerging like a rising wind and clouds. This is truly a good phenomenon in the era of preparing for constitutional government, which the government should praise and maintain. The members of our association were born in Shanghai, grew up in Shanghai, have careers in Shanghai, and their lives depend on Shanghai. Their joys and sorrows are different from those of officials who are only transient. Therefore, based on the heart of loving the country first and loving the hometown, we organized this association so that people from the city and districts can gather together, draft simple regulations, and elect officials, and it was established on a certain day of a certain month. This is to represent the citizens, and this is to promote municipal administration, directly seek the happiness of the entire city, and indirectly promote the observation of proper governance. We hope that the elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts of the entire city will supervise and guide us, so that our association can follow this hope. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

The chairman's report: Upon the order of the Central Government, I have come to be the head of Shanghai Municipality. In order to achieve political integrity, I will strive to continue to implement the policy plans of the previous administration in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. I am also unwilling to make many changes to the previous administration's personnel and administration in order to be familiar with the job. I and my colleagues in this government are a group gathered by duty and responsibility. We should work hard and not have the heart of being officials. I hope we can encourage each other. I believe that public officials should have the following spirit: 1. Be responsible, 2. Seek practicality, 3. Follow the rules. I am willing to embrace this spirit and work together so as not to fail the heavy trust of the Central Government and the high expectations of the citizens. 2.

<h3 id="e152">Declarations of the Two Postal Workers' Unions Advocating for the Recovery of the Savings and Remittance Bureau <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>To the public across the country: Since the Ministry of Communications established the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau on March 15th of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], ostensibly to exclusively handle postal savings and remittance services, the postal savings and remittance business has in reality continued to be concurrently handled by designated post offices. Our unions have repeatedly striven with the authorities to merge this kind of deformed, redundant organization that disrupts the postal organization system and wastes public funds, and have also loudly appealed to our compatriots in the hope that they will sympathize and assist us, so that the Chinese postal service, which has been painstakingly managed for over thirty years, will not suffer the disaster of division and destruction. However, time has passed, and two years have elapsed, and our goal has not yet been achieved, but the dangers facing the postal service have become all around us. If the savings and remittance business is not recovered for even one day, not only will the foundation of the postal service be shaken, but also the savings and remittance business, in which the people of the whole country have invested their lifelong hard-earned money, will also face the disaster of collapse due to the lack of separation from politics. At this critical moment, our unions are very vigilant and will certainly uphold their mission and work actively to achieve the original intention of merging the savings and remittance business, and to save the postal service from danger. This can be truthfully told to our compatriots. However, recent political tides have risen and fallen, inevitably affecting the postal service. Therefore, our unions feel even more keenly the importance of the mission we bear, and before this savings and remittance business is merged, there must be emergency remedies. There are three remedies: In order to protect the interests of the public's savings and to guarantee the credit of the postal savings and remittance business, all accounts of the Savings and Remittance General Bureau must be audited jointly by the representatives of the staff and workers, and published in detail, and all assets, securities, funds, and accounts must be kept in the custody of the joint accounting office of the Savings and Remittance General Bureau and the Postal General Bureau, and must not be appropriated or used, so as to avoid unexpected catastrophes, which is an urgent and indispensable plan. This is the first. All personnel of the Savings and Remittance General Bureau, from the deputy director downwards, must be filled by postal personnel, and all current personnel who are not from the postal service must be tested, and those who pass will continue to be retained, otherwise they will be dismissed, and it must be strictly stipulated that no officials who have not been tested shall be employed in the future. In this way, the postal examination system will not be destroyed, and the abuses of recommendation and filling of positions will be prevented. This is the second. The postal economy should prioritize the development of the postal service, which is still insufficient, such as the restoration of postal lines, the expansion of bureaus and offices, which are all related to the interests of the people. If this is not done, and all resources are wasted on unnecessary undertakings, there is a reversal of priorities. Since the country has suffered from wars for years and has also been hit by disasters, the postal income has been greatly reduced. If the marrow is squeezed out and used for other purposes, it is unlikely that it will not collapse. Therefore, there should be clear regulations on the postal economy, prioritizing the development of the postal service. This is the third. All three of these are emergency measures to recover the Savings and Remittance General Bureau. Our unions vow to fight to the death and never change our minds, and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. We dare to tell the people of the country everything we know, and hope that compatriots from all walks of life across the country will rise up together to uphold the safety of the postal service and the savings and remittance business, which truly depends on it. This declaration is hereby made on January 23rd of the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Merchants' Bureau Staff Telegraph Request to Retain Guo <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The staff of the General and Branch Bureaus of the Merchants' Bureau telegraphed the government, saying: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Vice President Chen, The Merchants' Bureau is the largest shipping institution in our country. In the past, due to the influence of the political situation and the improper management, it was heavily indebted and at a loss. The current Commissioner of the General Administration Office, Guo Waifeng, was appointed at a time when various shipping companies were required to dispatch soldiers and there was no income at all. The situation was extremely difficult. Commissioner Guo, amid all the difficulties, made appropriate arrangements, maintaining the original living conditions of the staff and workers, and also purchasing two more ocean liners, so that the shipping industry had a momentum of advancing a thousand miles a day. His talent and knowledge are outstanding, and his reorganization is well-organized, truly opening a new era for the Merchants' Bureau. With such talent in the country, the future of shipping administration will surely shine brightly. However, we have heard that Commissioner Guo, because the crew members of various ships requested to be paid double wages, suddenly had the intention to resign and requested to resign. Upon hearing this, the public was bewildered. We think that the Bureau's finances are in a desperate situation, and fortunately, thanks to Commissioner Guo's reorganization, there has been a gradual improvement. Once he leaves office, although Commissioner Guo has fulfilled his lofty aspirations, what about the development of the Merchants' Bureau, which will go with him? If we delay any longer and there is no one in charge, the lives of all the staff and workers will inevitably be cut off. We hope that you will understand the situation and look into the matter. We sincerely request that you look into the situation and grant him comfort and retention, so that the lives of thousands of staff and workers will not be affected. The Merchants' Bureau will be very fortunate, and all the staff and workers will be very fortunate. We are in great trepidation and cannot express our eagerness to await orders. The heads of various branch bureaus of the General Administration Office of the Merchants' Bureau, Shen Zhongyi, Li Fukai, Lin Yusheng, Wang Kaihua, Zhao Tiezhu, Hu Hewen, Qu Yuan, Zhang Yiming, He Jiaxian, Li Yanshen, etc., kowtow.</p>

<p>Criminal Killed in Thatched Cottage</p>
<p>At 9:15 PM last night, Western policeman Smith No. 133 of the Gordon Road Police Station led detectives on patrol in the Binlang Road area and saw a short-clothed person whose behavior was suspicious. He ordered him to stop, but the person continued to move forward. The Western policeman was anxious and chased him. In an instant, the person shot at the Western policeman with a pistol, and the bullet injured the Western policeman's lower jaw. The policeman also returned fire but missed and was escaped by him without a trace. At that time, a nearby sentry heard the gunshots and urgently telegraphed the Gordon Road Police Station to report the alarm. Three more detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident, and together with the injured Western policeman, they searched for the criminal in the nearby thatched cottages. Suddenly, a pistol was found in the seam of a thatched cottage, and it was about to be fired outwards. The detectives fired into the house first and killed the criminal on the spot. A pistol was also found on the ground in the house. The injured Western policeman was only grazed by the bullet and was not seriously injured.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Sound Domestic Film "Old Jinghua" Preview <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The First Production of Mingxing Sida Tong</p>
<p>Last fall, Mingxing Film Company sent people to the United States to purchase a large number of the latest sound and color film equipment, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, and hired many senior technicians to work on it. After the equipment was shipped to China one after another, General Manager Zhang Shichuan led the sound film crew and dozens of male and female stars such as Hu Die, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and Xia Peizhen to Ping to shoot location scenes for "Tixiao Yinyuan" and other films for two months before returning to Shanghai and working hard on the shooting of interior scenes. The first four-way sound film production, called "Old Jinghua," was completely completed the day before yesterday. This film is a masterpiece of the famous director Zhang Shichuan's careful management. The major stars who play the important roles in the play, such as Wang Zhengqi, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and Zhu Qiuhen, are all the best of the time. The famous playwright Hong Shen also plays an important role as a guest performer. The performance is profound and delicate. All the people in the whole play have their own strengths, which is really unique in domestic films. The clarity of the sound on the film is especially special and excellent. The plot is tortuous and the scenes are compact, so it contains a lot of stimulation and is thought-provoking. The film strives to write out the various darknesses of the society and politics of the old capital at that time from a tragic story of a noble family at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and implies that the fall of the Qing Dynasty was due to the indulgence and amnesia of those in power, which is intended to be a shocking warning. Other aspects, such as the clarity and pleasingness of the photography and the richness and grandeur of the background, are all excellent. It is heard that it has been scheduled to preview at the Carlton Theater at 10:30 AM today (the 24th), and the newspaper industry and film merchants are invited to visit, and it will definitely win praise and open a new record for domestic sound films.</p>

<h3 id="e165">A Letter from a Refugee from the Northeast <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>I am a refugee soldier and student who was shot to Beijing by the foreign guns and cannons of the violent army in this national crisis. Before the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident], I was studying in the senior high school department of the Northeast Student Team in Shenyang. Because I was condemned by my conscience for being a soldier with a gun who did not take up the gun to fight the violent army and fulfill a little of the military duty of a soldier, I used the money that my family in Suizhong, which had suffered a major flood last year, sent me so that I would no longer live this difficult refugee life and go home, to start a Tie Xue [Iron Blood] Weekly with the purpose of awakening the people, (1) understanding Japan, (2) understanding the Northeast, (3) knowing military affairs, (4) vowing to resist Japan, and (5) saving the country with iron and blood. The first issue was born in this environment. But seven days passed in an instant, and the funds were still not available. After running around for many days, I finally received 10 yuan from our Education Director Wang Yizhe and 94 yuan from General Team Leader Ji Shaoji [the current captain of the 2nd Infantry Team], who persuaded his subordinates to donate, and more than 40 yuan from my own manuscript fees, so that it could continue to be published until the ninth issue, and now it can be said that economic assistance has been cut off. There is no way, so it is in a state of invisible suspension, but I still can't bear to sit idly by and watch this small life sink down like this, so I came up with the idea of asking the comrades in society who are generally passionate, patriotic, and vowed to resist Japan for economic assistance. Although the funds are not much, even small contributions can make a big difference. I hope that comrades from all walks of life will enthusiastically help.</p>
<p>In addition, I also plan to solicit members. All comrades with the same purpose can join the society. Comrades who are enthusiastic, patriotic, vow to resist Japan, and advocate iron and blood for survival are welcome to communicate with Zhang Zuohua, Tie Xue Weekly, No. 13, Jia, Qihe Lou, Beichi Yu, Beijing.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, this kind of correspondence is usually not published because of your enthusiasm, we are making an exception to make it public. The methods for joining the society and subscribing to the newspaper are omitted. The Japanese invaders are advancing step by step. I hope people will advocate and hurry up to do practical resistance work. Attached by the reporter.</p>

<h3 id="e166">A Lesson on How to Be a Son (Part 2) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that a son should be taught to be a son by being a son. If I want every son to become a certain kind of son, I have to become that kind of son myself first. If I want to teach my son to be self-reliant and to help others to be self-reliant, I have to be self-reliant and help others myself. If I want to teach my son to be self-sufficient and to help others to be self-sufficient, I have to be self-sufficient and help others myself. Recently, I and the children discussed a teaching-and-doing process of self-reliance, self-reliance, self-help, and helping others, which is divided into four stages. In the first stage, when three meals are full, everyone shouts "Baby";</p>
<p>In the second stage, small things are done in a small way, and pocket money is earned by oneself;</p>
<p>In the third stage, all food, clothing, shelter, and transportation are not relied on others;</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, there is surplus energy to live independently, and helping others to be self-reliant.</p>
<p>My fourth child is six years old and is still in the first stage. My third child is nine years old. When he was in the countryside, he had already reached the second stage, but now that he has come to the city, he has returned to the first stage. My second child is thirteen years old and is in the second stage. My first child is seventeen years old and is in the third stage. At the same time, everyone is still studying and working together to move forward to the fourth stage.</p>
<p>Chinese society generally has only two stages for the education of children: one is total dependence, and the other is sudden independence. There is a lack of a gradual bridge in between. If adults suddenly encounter changes and children lose their dependence, how painful it is!</p>
<h3 id="e167">Talking about Bai Long with Loyalty and Bravery <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Xinfo</p>
<p>Liaoji [Liaoning and Jilin] has fallen. It has been more than a hundred days. The officers guarding the territory did not resist in the front. The responsible government did not send reinforcements in the rear. General Ma could not support the building alone. The common people had nothing to do with their bare hands. Seeing that Shenzhou [China] was about to sink and would no longer belong to me. Therefore, among the black rivers and white waters [Northeast], heroic people rose up and refused bribes to kill the enemy, shocking the enemy's courage, such as Xiao Bailong and Lao Beifeng, who are the most outstanding. A guest from Zhifu [Yantai] told me about Xiao Bailong's defeat of the Japanese army. Hearing this, my blood boiled and I applauded with joy. Hei Ma and Bai Long are also worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>Xiao Bailong's surname is Zhang, and Xing Tian is his given name. He is from Pinggu County, Hebei Province. He was a merchant in his early years and was good at riding, shooting, and dart throwing. He was heroic and righteous, helping the weak and eliminating the strong. He did not pay attention to trading skills. He had three thousand retainers, with the style of Mengchang. In a few years, his family property was gone. Finally, he joined the green forest. However, he still did not change his usual state. He robbed the rich and powerful officials, but helped the poor. In the spring of last year, he was once appeased by the provincial government, but then he became Feng Fu [a hunter who returned to his former profession]. In October of last year, when the Japanese were taking advantage of the protection of the League of Nations and acting wantonly, they wanted to take Jinzhou and station in Tientsin. The Japanese had long heard of Bailong's bravery and secretly bribed him with 10,000 Japanese yuan and hundreds of boxes of artillery, rifles, and bullets to cause trouble. Long pretended to agree and accepted the bribe. The Japanese were overjoyed, thinking that the Chinese were all greedy, and that it would be easy to take the land in one fell swoop. After Long had both money and equipment, he suddenly attacked the Japanese army. Many enemies died. The Japanese were furious and sent troops to retaliate. Long knew that he was no match for them and quickly fled into the mountains and valleys of Tongliao, coming and going quickly and appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The Japanese hated him with gnashing teeth. Now Bailong is planning to contact General Ma and the militia to jointly eliminate the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Feng Yuxiang's Talk on Politics <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Shuilin</p>
<p>Feng's strict military discipline is well known to the Chinese people. His method of purifying politics is also unmatched. Xue Dubi and Guo Zhihuan were Feng's left and right assistants. Xue was in charge of political affairs and Guo was in charge of financial affairs. Both were diligent in politics and firm in integrity, and both were well-known at the time. After Feng settled Henan, the affairs were more troublesome than in the Guannei [inside the pass]. Feng went to the office every morning. Civil and military officials were received in order. If there was any disagreement, he would be punished by beating, kneeling, or facing the wall. It was difficult to avoid it for a day. Not only were officials with small positions like this, but even Xue and Guo, who were respected, could not avoid it. One day, Feng was sitting in the Guang Hall, and Xue was standing to the right, serving. Because he slightly offended his intention, he slapped him in the face and ordered him to redo it immediately. Guo was offended, and it was the same. Afterwards, Xue and Guo did not complain. Feng served in politics and always told people an ancient proverb: "Politics is not about talking more, but about doing it."</p>
<p>Henan's education was less than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Feng tried hard to revitalize it. In addition to running the Xunzheng [Political Training] Academy in Kaifeng to train emergency talents, the teachers of each middle school were selected. For a time, the youths of Kyoto [Beijing] and Shanghai with some literary reputation rushed to it like a hundred rivers running into the sea. The youth circles then launched a slogan: "Go to Henan." Its momentum could not be underestimated. This can be seen here. Unfortunately, the war started soon and it was interrupted.</p>
<p>The first National Guoshu [Chinese martial arts] Competition was held at the Nanjing Stadium. On the opening day, various dignitaries came one after another. According to the example, all made speeches. The speech platform was north of the competition platform, and the people were south of the competition platform, more than twenty feet apart. The first few people spoke, and the listeners did not understand very well. They could only see their mouths talking and their fingers gesturing. When Feng spoke, everyone could hear clearly. Speakers said that Feng's speech could be heard by 100,000 people, which was not an exaggeration. The general idea of the speech that day was that today you are here to see, you must learn it in your heart, and you must do it when you go home. It was about two minutes, concise and to the point.</p>

<p>A Hermit Who Never Approached Women in His Lifetime In Birmingham, England, there is an old man named A. Blythwaite, who is 87 years old this year. He claims that he has never approached women in his life and has never kissed a woman. He once said to people, "Since I grew up, after I first knew human affairs, the first step was to strive for independence, without the help of women. When I was fourteen years old, I learned to knit socks for myself and sew buttons on my shirts for myself." At the age of twenty-three, he took care of the housework alone, cooking and washing his own clothes. He also never interacted with women on weekdays. Only once a year did a woman step into his house, and that was when his sister came to visit him on Christmas. Recently, he said to people again, "I am already 87 years old. I am very healthy. I am very happy. I also have money in the bank. The reason why I can be like this is because I have never kissed a woman." But this kind of life is too boring and too uninteresting.</p>

<p>— Suspicion Begins</p>
<p>Xia Ziyi, a man from the Xiyin Study, is skilled. The Ziyi seal ink he makes is outstanding for its time. For the past year, Xia Zi has been researching and studying the art of making ink, innovating and creating more refined seal inks than before. It can be said that he has truly reached the peak of perfection, meeting the ideal standard. He dares not say there will be none better in the future, but he is undoubtedly the best so far. Xia Ziyi does not easily make ink without good materials. His diligence in searching for them is rare. Last summer, he obtained more than ten catties of four-year-old cinnabar from Hunan. He selected the best, refined it for months, and made several dozen taels of lotus root silk ink. The beauty of its color and quality surpasses even the Xuanhe watermark. The Qianlong Chicheng is even more inferior. The most difficult thing is to make the oil and paste of the ink even and clean. The better the sand, the heavier the quality. The oil should be clear and light. Heavy sinks and light floats are natural laws. Therefore, the best ink, when placed in a jar and not stirred for several days, often has oil floating on top, accumulating around the edges. When stamping on paper, it is easy to create an oily outline. However, if it does not yellow the paper and disappears without a trace over time, it is already extremely refined. As for the inferior quality ink, the oil is originally greasy and stagnant. Even if you want to see the oil floating in the jar, you cannot get it. The ink made by Xia Zi this time, even if it is not stirred for a month, will not have oil floating around. There is no appearance of being thin on top and thick on the bottom. (However, it must be stirred from time to time, so that the ink becomes more and more bright and beautiful, easy to clump together and come out of the jar, which should never be abandoned.) When stamping on paper, there is even less trace of oil to be seen. The refinement of his research, refining, and mixing is unparalleled. Also, purely cinnabar ink is initially dull in color when first made, but gradually becomes glossy, red, and bright over time. The common people often add foreign red and cloud vermilion to speed up the redness, so that it is easy to please the eye when made. However, pure cinnabar ink will be as red and bright as those with foreign red added in one or two years. After a longer period, it will far surpass those with foreign red. It is even more beautiful after being removed from the jar. The color of those mixed with foreign red will fade over time and will never come out of the jar. By examining this, one can understand why pure cinnabar ink is so valuable. Xia Zi makes ink with the intention of passing it down through generations, striving to avoid confusing purple with red and vowing not to mix foreign red vermilion markings. The Ziyi seal ink he makes can provide evidence of being removed from the jar. Therefore, it is completely different from those commonly made. At the beginning of this production, the color and luster were already as bright and red as those stored for two or three years. If it goes through more years, its exquisite beauty will become unimaginable. It will also be easier and faster to remove from the jar than previous productions. The above two points are the greatest advantages of Xia Zi's lotus root silk ink, which surpasses all others. Xia Zi, based on his rich experience and deep research, is able to make it more and more refined. A month ago, this unworthy one sipped tea at the Xiyin Study and had the opportunity to see this newly made product. I praised it as the emperor of ink. Friends who are good at appreciation also said that the evaluation was appropriate. Xia Zi was overjoyed and playfully named his study the Mud Emperor Pavilion. This unworthy one engraved a Mud Emperor Pavilion seal and presented it to him, and also signed the board in his pavilion. (Qu Que)</p>

<p>The painter Wang Shizi recently moved to No. 9 Maigali Road, Disiwei Road. A small two-story building, bright, clean, and quiet. He splashes ink from morning to night, and his paintings become more outstanding and elegant. I once commented that Shizi's paintings are light but have spirit, beautiful but not vulgar, which friends thought was an apt description. The other day, Shizi asked me to write a plaque inscription, "Ink Farming Cottage." When asked about its meaning, it was simply a homophone of Maigali. So I jokingly wrote a record for it: Shizi recently rented a house in Maigali, north of Shanghai, and named his hall "Ink Farming Cottage," a homophone. Pens and inks can be used as farming tools, and I am fortunate to still have my tongue. Rice farming has descendants who will pass it on without fail. You are enjoying great fame for your artistic achievements and celebrating a bountiful harvest. The joy of his solitary pleasures is something that even the so-called ten thousand bushels of grain and a thousand chariots of horses in the world cannot add to. Maigali and Ink Farming are the best. I put down my pen and wrote this record, also a play on words. Now I write it to show those who know Shizi.</p>

<p>Self-narration by Movie Star Hu Die</p>
<p>Later, in Beiping, "Fate in Tears and Laughter" began filming. Because the location shots in the film had to be realistic, it was decided to go to Beiping to shoot them. Beiping is a place I used to visit! I seem to still remember those towering palaces, the ancient city walls, the tourists in Central Park, the beautiful rickshaws on the road, the dry weather, the strong sunlight, and even the crisp voices and straightforward attitude of the people of Beiping... everything, everything, although it has been many years since I have been there, I have never forgotten it. Therefore, when the news of the departure to Beiping was announced in the company, many people were as happy as I was. Before the departure, I told many people who had never been to Beiping about the scenery of Beiping, almost making Beiping a paradise for us. The most interesting thing was that I told them that in Beiping, you could rent a large house for twenty silver dollars, which surprised friends who lived in small rooms in Shanghai. I told them that you would never see heavy rain in Beiping all year round, but Mr. Cheng Bugao regretfully took out the newly purchased raincoat from his suitcase.</p>
<p>Walking in the middle of a group of people with infinite interest and infinite hope, I was especially proud. At this time, everyone had woken up from the busy preparations and said goodbye to our photography studio with an expression that seemed to carry some due courtesy, but there was no feeling of parting. Several cars carried a group of people who were like laughing children. From this moment on, we seemed to be in another world.</p>
<p>From Shanghai North Station to Jinan, our group was constantly watched by others. "This is the Star Film Company going to Beiping to shoot Fate in Tears and Laughter." "This is Hu Die,"... "This is Zheng Xiaoqiu"... "This is..." became many words familiar to our ears; "Watched by ten eyes and pointed at by ten fingers," we seemed to be subjected to even more serious surveillance. On the train, we read newspapers, talked, and didn't feel tired from the long journey. I can't tell you all the trivial things during the journey. I only remember that when we arrived in Jinan, many reporters came to visit us on the train. Mr. Zhang Shichuan smiled and said to us, "It's a great honor! This is the treatment for important people."</p>

<p>Liang Xiaoyun suddenly became slightly angry and said, "If you have friends coming, just let them come. With me sitting here, what does it matter? Am I not your friend? Even though I am a woman, does that mean girlfriends can't openly come and sit here? Do I have to sneak around, hide, and avoid seeing other people's faces? How strange. You actually dislike me now. I want to ask you, what kind of person do you take me for? And what are your intentions? "An Yutian didn't mean to say anything wrong, but got a nose full of ash for nothing. He was also severely scolded by her. He felt a wave of injustice in his heart, and sweat beads as big as soybeans dripped down his forehead. He wiped it with a handkerchief and tried to defend himself with a bitter smile, "No, it's really an old senior coming. Also, an antique from the 17th or 18th century. Stubborn and doesn't approve of free interaction between men and women. In case he acts old-fashioned and says something unpleasant when he sees you, wouldn't that make everyone unhappy and just make you angry? That's why I thought of asking you not to meet this kind of person to avoid some unnecessary troubles. But I didn't expect you to be so suspicious and say such angry words. I'm so wronged." As he spoke, he almost choked and was about to cry. Seeing him so distressed and pitiful, Liang Xiaoyun's heart suddenly softened, and she relaxed her tone and said, "Since you said that, is it true that some old, stubborn country bumpkin is coming? I don't want to get angry with this kind of person either. Naturally, it's better to leave first. But why didn't you explain it clearly earlier and make me feel uncomfortable? Never mind. Considering that you haven't been in a good mood these past two days and your mind is confused, I won't argue with you. I'm leaving now. But you must come to my place tomorrow. Don't break your promise. Otherwise, I don't care what new or old antiques you have in your house. I'm still going to come and find you myself." Seeing that she had dispelled her doubts and was willing to leave, An Yutian felt a heavy weight lifted from his heart. He secretly chanted "Amitabha." But thinking that time was pressing, the sooner she left, the better. He stood up from the table and said, "I'm full. If you don't want to eat anymore, I'll call a car for you." Liang Xiaoyun smiled, "What's the rush? Are you urging me to leave? I hate being pushed around the most. If you rush me, I'll get angry again. Although I've had enough wine and food, I can't just run out with my mouth covered in grease. I need to wash my face. Please, ask the waiter to bring me a basin of hot water."</p>

<h3 id="e174">Financial and Gold Markets Continue to Decline <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Unpredictable Changes. Yesterday, the price of gold continued to fall, with further declines. The changes remained intense. There were twelve taels of returns in the morning and afternoon, making it unpredictable. Peers were at a loss. Finally, it fell by about four taels again. It opened slightly lower. Although overseas silver markets rose, U.S. silver was in short supply, so there was no significant impact. Due to the unsettled situation, large investors vigorously sold. Exchange rates for British currency, etc., tended to loosen and were listed longer by one grade. As a result, market conditions turned weak, and there was a rush to the lower reaches. There were frequent declines of more than ten taels, almost falling to 660 taels. However, because the U.S. exchange rate was still stable, it was due to small exchange rate adjustments. In particular, buyers also revived and calmly went upwards, resulting in around seventy taels. There were no major overseas news. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday and the market was closed, it was said that the swap rate was raised to three taels, which was posted by the bulls, but there was no transaction. It was also found that there were quite a few chaotic moments in the market this week. It was very sharp at the beginning of the week, but then became sluggish. The maximum price was 99 taels, and the minimum price was 61 taels, a difference of 38 taels. Overall, compared to the previous Saturday, it fell 9 taels and 6 qian, etc.</p>
<p>It opened down one tael. At the opening, it was slightly lower by one tael, counted as 672 taels. The large strip rose again by 8 fen 3. The forward price was 5/16. The silver price only rose by 1/4. It immediately returned up 1 tael and a half, to 73 taels and a half. Suddenly, Hengxing, Hengchangyong, Yuanheng, Wanxing, Shunli, etc., sold off one after another, really because the atmosphere was bad. The supply in the market was greater than demand, so the price plummeted by 11 taels. Only counted as one or two taels of the head, at 9:15, it was 62 taels and a half. Later, because a telegram came from India to buy British gold at 11 pence to 10 pence 9375, sold by Mitsui, and because Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Tongdachang, etc., all entered, Hengxing also suddenly bought three taels and zero, for 65 taels and 8 qian. When the announcement of British gold was released, it was extended by 25, and the U.S. dollar was also increased by 25, and then it retreated to 63 taels and a half. It was almost that the far-month U.S. dollar was absorbed by brokers, 33 yuan, 1875. In an instant, retail households bought in, adding three taels, but the U.S. dollar could be settled at three yuan, and because Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, etc., tended to sell, and there were few buyers, the price fell by one to five taels and zero.</p>
<p>Approaching 60 taels, at 9:30, it was 61 taels. Soon after, Anda absorbed the May U.S. dollar at 33 yuan 125, and the April British gold did 10 pence 9375. At this time, the sellers stopped slightly, and Xiexingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, Yifengyong, etc., went to the market to buy, so the price gradually rose. After 10:30, it was 67 taels and 8 qian, but for a moment there were two taels of ups and downs. Later, because Tong Taichang sold, and HSBC issued the May U.S. dollar at three yuan, it immediately suppressed it by three taels, to 64 taels and 8 qian. After 10:45, there were often more than two taels of ups and downs. After 11:00, Dadecheng, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, etc., competed to buy, and Muggary absorbed the April U.S. dollar at 32 yuan 9375, so the price increased by more than three taels. At 11:15, it was 68 taels and 3 qian. After only three minutes, it fell to 6 taels and 7 qian. Buyers rose up again, and before long, Fuyu, Hongkangyong, Yuhe, Hengxing, Daxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, etc., all came to compete to buy, but the number was not huge. Generally, hat snatchers on the platform worked hard to hype it up, until 11:45, it was 70 taels, but it was a flash in the pan, and it went back in.</p>
<p>Seventy taels, it was 68 taels and 8 qian. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 69 taels and 2 qian. Generally, retail households were eager to sell, not to carry it overnight, and because it was a Saturday market close, the price fell by more than two taels again, only about 67 taels. It continued to fall three taels and eight. Compared to the previous day's listing, it fell three taels and eight qian. (Falling for three consecutive days totaled 23 taels and 4 qian.) The maximum for half a day was 73 taels and a half, and the minimum was 61 taels, a difference of 12 taels and a half. The early market for goods was 72 taels and a half, and the noon close was 68 taels. The announced price has been changed to 744 taels, totaling 80 taels inside and outside. Finally, 75 or 6 taels. The registered water replenishment totaled 69 taels. The bare strip added 4 taels and a half. The transaction was smooth.</p>
<p>Inconsistent transactions. Transactions on the platform were inconsistent. Statistics Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Xiexingyong, etc., all entered. Hengxing, Dakang, Hengchangyong, Hongkangyong, Yuhe, etc., went out and then went in. Tong Taichang entered first and then went out, totaling about 700 strips. Qianchangxiang went out more than 1,000 strips (rumored to be on behalf of the Sino-French Bank). Yuanheng, Yuantai, and Futaiheng all went out. Dadecheng sold on behalf of customers, but the goods set went in. The exchange settlement was not very active. The Guangdong gang bought more and sold less, totaling more than 1,000 strips. The Dalian gang entered a total of 400 or 500 strips and exited more than 200 strips.</p>

As for the actual opening price of the bank, if the British gold tended to loosen, the result was to extend 125, the U.S. dollar was flat, not far from the previous night, and the gold market was weak, unaffected, due to the small exchange rate adjustment.

Also, the British gold was only tens of thousands of pounds. Mumbai telegraphed to buy April and May futures. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, there was no market, as usual, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Slight Signs of Weakness in the Cotton Market <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is calm. Due to the decline in gold prices, and especially the weakness in the American cotton market, with most expecting Indian cotton prices to fall, the market trend is weakening. However, recently, actual demand has picked up somewhat, and selling prices are also high. Due to a lack of supply from various sources, the Hankou and Ningbo trading houses are observing the high prices with very ambitious sentiments.</p>
<p>This month, Hankou standard longs have been liquidating. The Hankou standard front-month futures market opened at the exchange with minimal over-the-counter trading of American cotton. The current month rose five points, and the distant month fell five points. In the afternoon, the current month's longs liquidated, falling 1.5 cents. Total daily trading volume was 44,600 bales.

<p>Yesterday, the supply in Hu Nan was not abundant, and the inventory in Pu was weak.

<p>Foreign Firms Cover Short Positions Quietly</p>
<p>Taizhou Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market saw little buying and selling. Only one transaction was reported in the general market in the morning: 400 bags of Saigon rice at $11.75 and 200 bags of Xiaojiao rice at $10.01. Prices were up 6-7 cents to 1 cent compared to the previous market. No transactions occurred in the afternoon because sellers were unwilling to sell. However, foreign firms and importers engaged in new transactions and sold recovered goods. It is said that some foreign merchants are searching the market to buy futures contracts to cover previously sold positions because it is rumored that Japanese merchants are expanding their purchases in the producing areas, and the spot goods have been completely bought up. Foreign firms previously sold a significant amount to the market, and it is feared that they will not be able to deliver the actual goods as contracted. If this rumor is confirmed, the market will experience a significant rebound. Yesterday, the price of recovered goods on this street increased by 3-5 cents, resulting in no transactions. However, Taizhou rice continued to arrive in large quantities in recent days. Another batch arrived yesterday, with 400 bags of Taizhou white rice offered at $11.65 to $11.57, 500 bags of early rice at $10.025, and 300 bags of brown rice at $10.06, all of which were higher than the previous prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed signs of being flat and weak. Because the quotation for foreign wheat was still down by 1-2 cents, manufacturers have already made firm orders for foreign wheat, so their attitude is naturally unfavorable. In addition, as the end of the current month approaches, some of the head-covering warehouse warrants from before the New Year have been returned due to the quality of the goods. Therefore, February is showing stability due to head-covering and the standard for customer purchases. For distant months, factories are slightly selling, and the overall situation is flat. As a result, the current month fell 7.5 cents compared to the previous day, February was up 2.5 cents, March was unchanged, April was down 2.5 cents, and May and June were down 7.5 cents.</p>

<p>It's Not Easy to Get Better</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed signs of hovering. As the current month's delivery approached, it initially remained sluggish, down 3-5 cents from the previous day. Later, it recovered as manufacturers were rumored to have buying intentions. The various distant months also showed weakness in the morning sessions, but in the afternoon sessions, as market sentiment stabilized slightly, there was a slight recovery. It is observed that it is not easy to get better. As a result, the current month was unchanged from the previous day, February was down 2 cents, March was down 1 cent, April was unchanged, May was up 1 cent, and there was no comparison for June.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Standard Prices of Piece Goods, Wool Fabrics Also Fell Sharply <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Imported Goods Were Originally Cheaper... Market Sales Have Reached the Season's End</p>
<p>The wool and wool fabric market is currently in the off-season. Selling prices have been weakening every day since last month, and standards have not yet fallen, although they have long been secretly reduced. However, well-known and established brands in the wool fabric business, such as Rongtai's 15330 yuan Zhigong, Deki's 1440 and Anli's Jubaopen, Lulin, Deki's Fengshenbang Walter Cloth, Deki's 1339 assorted bilges, and other goods, are generally considered indicators of price movement in the wool fabric market. Therefore, the rise and fall of the above goods serve as benchmarks for other wool fabrics. Unexpectedly, the market prices of these goods also fell sharply the day before yesterday, with an average drop of several cents per yard. For example, Rongtai's 15330 yuan Zhigong woolen cloth was reduced to 7 liang 7 qian 5 fen, Deki's 1440 Walter Cloth was 5 liang 1 qian 5 fen, Anli's Jubaopen was 7 liang, Deki's 1339 assorted bilges was 3 liang 2 qian 2 fen 5 li, and Fengshenbang Walter Cloth was 4 liang 3 qian 5 fen. The reason for the sharp decline is the direct impact of cheaper imported goods and stagnant market sales.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Dried Goods and Black Dates Market Quiet <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the black date market has become quiet as purchases from various trading houses have gradually become sufficient. According to a letter from Diyiham, prices are also flat and weak. Therefore, there have only been sporadic transactions here in recent days. The current market prices are as follows: top-grade black dates from 20 liang to 18 liang, top Gaozhuang 15-16 liang, second Gaozhuang 14 liang, top-grade bulk 13 liang to 12.5 liang, medium-grade bulk 12 liang to 11.5 liang, and second-grade dates 9 liang 3-4 qian to 8.5 liang. It is hoped that there will be improvement in the future market once spring sales begin.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Silk and Tea Foreign Firms Silk Market Lifeless <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Due to the slight drop in Japanese silk prices, overseas Shanghai white filature factories reported that silk prices were 300-400 taels lower than the cost of the factory silk, resulting in excessive losses. The market atmosphere was dull. Yesterday, only Taihe imported 5 bales of Baigan silk and Gaobei imported 10 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e190">There are Still Over a Thousand Bales of Chefoo Raw Silk Inventory <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Chefoo raw silk produced in Zhejiang and Hubei is widely sold in Europe and America. Since the new silk was launched last autumn, sales in Europe have been difficult to achieve smoothly, but the market has been able to maintain its position. This is because the markets in New York and Lyon have been affected by the low price of Japanese silk. Moreover, due to the intense Anglo-Indian political struggle, the export of Chefoo raw silk has become even more difficult. The inventory in Shanghai warehouses is not weak. The total inventory of Chefoo raw silk in the city is still over 1,500 bales, of which fancy-cart dry silk accounts for 70%, and the rest is flat-cart large silk.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign tea firms in this port, especially those dealing in high-end Zhenmei tea such as Lüzhuang, Xiehe, and Tianxiang, continued their efforts to purchase tea. Medium-grade and ordinary Zhenmei teas were also being actively traded by firms such as Yihe and Tongfu. Trading was unusually brisk, with total sales in the city reaching over 1,100 chests. Selling prices were all trending firmer. The current inventory of green tea from Lüzhuang is becoming increasingly scarce, and the sales of native tea are also showing signs of activity.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Hardware, Pig Lead Sales are Uniquely Brisk <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has shown signs of nearing an end, so there are very few goods in the market that are showing any vitality. However, the pig lead market, which has been stagnant for a long time, has reversed from weak to strong. The price is 14 taels 1 qian 5 fen per dan, which is 1 qian 5 fen higher than before. Although yesterday was Saturday, there were still over 2,000 dan traded. As a result, the market goods suddenly became scarce after being purchased, and the sentiment is very good. There is great hope that the market will continue to improve.</p>

<p>Sales of Boshan anthracite lump coal have been sluggish recently. The inventory in various warehouses is not moving, so market prices are weak. Yesterday, section coal was sold at 14 taels per ton, and bulk coal was sold at 11 taels 2 qian 5 fen. Sales of Xiaoshan lump coal are also sluggish, and prices are also falling. It is currently selling for only 13 taels per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Fortunately, Advertising Literature <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>"The ancients always loved swords. A three-foot Qingping sword emerges under the candlelight. Seeing the country's deep-seated hatred, they all relied on it to avenge it. Now the sword has become a weapon of the past, and China's armament is difficult to compare with the world, causing heroes and patriots to sigh in vain. Sitting alone late at night, resentment is like a mountain. Only by smoking ×× cigarettes can one slightly alleviate the frustration..."</p>
<p>Such "advertising literature" has been popular in Shanghai for a while and has long been "commonplace," so there is no need to criticize it.</p>
<p>"Smoking ×× brand cigarettes" is enough to show "not forgetting patriotism." This logic is a characteristic of Shanghai's advertising literature. By analogy, "Yunnan-Guizhou-Sichuan native opium" is also still showing "not forgetting patriotism." "Playing mahjong" and "gambling on pai gow" are also "not forgetting patriotism" because Yunnan-Guizhou-Sichuan native products are the best among domestic goods, and mahjong and pai gow are also the best among domestic goods, so they are still "not forgetting patriotism."</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many ways to be patriotic: "love without forgetting to save the country," "reading without forgetting to save the country," "being an official without forgetting to be patriotic," and even "whoring without forgetting to save the country." These theories are all very logical and are absolutely true.</p>
<p>However, when the Japanese rioted in the Hongkou North Sichuan Road area, burned the Sanyou Industrial Society, and destroyed Chinese stores, our national salvation groups, suicide squads, and volunteer armies were still holding meetings, giving speeches, posting slogans, and issuing circular telegrams. In fact, those who earnestly do national salvation work in writing, on paper, and orally are not only profit-seeking merchants, speculative politicians, and frivolous young people, but also the great men of our country.</p>
<p>Each great man's declaration, circular telegram, plan, and outline is full of "not forgetting patriotism," but in reality, they are all selling plaster, which does not deviate from the principle of "smoking ×× brand cigarettes and still not forgetting patriotism."</p>
<p>Advertising is popular, and the country will perish without a day. Alas!</p>

<p>Qiong Mei:</p>
<p>Since this weak motherland has been invaded by the Japanese bandits, how turbulent and painful are my surging hot blood and this fragile soul! Therefore, at this time, I only feel that the entire universe is extremely dark and the entire life is extremely restless. Finally, I feel that the air of grief and indignation has stirred my heart, and I am determined to fulfill my small responsibilities.</p>
<p>Because of the rushing of hot blood, the stimulation of sadness, and... ah! My weak nerves have been striving to awaken me, occupying my entire soul, and inspiring my will, so I naturally completely accepted it. However, my heart has enjoyed the invigorating medicine, and I really feel more cheerful! Therefore, the brain filled with excitement has instructed me to join this large team that automatically goes to the Northeast to swear to resist Japan.</p>
<p>But our goal of fighting to the death has easily achieved a satisfactory result. Finally, we are going to the front line to work hard to complete our task of killing the enemy! In that moment of gunfire, countless ferocious enemies flashed into our eyes. At this time, ah! My jealous heart has been aroused, and I can't wait to immediately use my boiling hot blood and this fearless spirit to sweep away this monstrous evil spirit and wash away our greatest shame. But the sound of advancing has risen, how happy are we? So, the flying-like healthy feet are also showing their power, rushing to the enemy's front line, and my god gun that kills the enemy is firing bursts of hot bullets, finally flying into the enemy's vital points, and the enemy's front line is completely shaken. Finally, we occupied the enemy's entire defense and won the greatest victory. Qiong Mei! When this news reaches your ears, I think you will be very happy, right?</p>
<p>Now we are going to meet this barbaric enemy again with the spirit of courage and perseverance, but the loud call has also sounded! Ah! I, Qiong, who urgently need to pack my bags and set off, have to put down my pen temporarily. Qiong Mei! Goodbye! I wish you</p>

<h3 id="e197">Egg Suspended in Water Su Su <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>This is an interesting physics trick that everyone can try. It costs very little and yields an important principle in physics.</p>
<p>Now, prepare the necessary items: a fresh egg, a tall glass bottle filled with water, and a packet of salt.</p>
<p>First, put the egg into the bottle. The egg is heavier than water and naturally sinks to the bottom of the bottle. Now, slowly add salt to the water, a little at a time, while stirring the water. When the salt is added to the appropriate amount, the egg will completely obey your command. You lift it up and place it in the center of the bottle. As soon as you take your hand away, it will still stop moving. If you raise it a little higher or lower it a little, it will also obey your orders and dare not move around on its own.</p>
<p>The principle of this phenomenon is quite simple. Because the specific gravity of the egg is greater than that of clean water, the egg sinks. Adding salt to the water turns the clean water into salt water. The specific gravity of salt water is greater than that of clean water. The more salt that is added, the greater the specific gravity. When the specific gravity of the salt water is equal to the specific gravity of the egg, the egg will neither float nor sink and will stop in the water. If you add more salt so that the specific gravity of the salt water is greater than that of the egg, the egg will float on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a ridiculous fact that comes to mind that is the same principle as this experiment. It may be worth mentioning in passing. Everyone knows that to the east of the city of Jerusalem is a saltwater lake called the Dead Sea. The water there contains 25% salt, and the specific gravity is particularly high. No matter who runs to that place, they can swim very safely.</p>

<p>People who have never been to the metropolis of Shanghai always have fantasies of a "great, mysterious, and enchanting gold mine." But as soon as you step into the metropolis of Shanghai, you feel that it hides sadness, depravity, pain... and constant calls!</p>
<p>In the morning, lying in bed, you hear:</p>
<p>"Little cabbage, green vegetables, radishes!..." This voice is always sad and poignant, and it will give you a feeling of sadness. After a while, another burst follows: "Shen Bao, Shi Bao... Xinwen Bao!..." a rough voice</p>
<p>At noon, the sounds gradually become more complex, sad, heavy, light, sandy, broken, and rumbling in the streets and alleys. That kind of life's cry makes it impossible for your brain to rest for a moment. Even if you walk in the street, the ragged children and the sick and declining old paupers will follow behind you.</p>
<p>"Sir, young master... do something good!..." a burst of chaotic cries. Is it a little more peaceful in the evening? It's really more peaceful! But soon, that kind of call will strike your heart again in the quiet night and the secluded alley:</p>
<p>"Olives, buy one for a cent... sandalwood olives... buy olives!..."</p>
<p>This voice is always clear and melodious, more natural and wonderful than any music! But its ending is too sad and too sour! I can't bear to listen any longer!</p>
<p>Soon you hear:</p>
<p>The hissing sound of a cracked bamboo shell, followed by: "Fire bamboo, be careful!..." a short, abrupt, sandy voice gradually approaching from afar, gradually receding from near...</p>
<p>Late at night, I am awakened by a troubled battle. I barely hear:</p>

<p>"Sweet osmanthus white sugar lotus seed porridge, taro with sugar!..." I have lived in Shanghai for ten years, and every day I wake up sadly, sleep sadly, and have to be startled sadly in the middle of the night!</p>
<p>"The call of the city, the call of the city!..." When will you disappear from my ears?</p>

<p>Since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, everything in society has been built on capitalism. Modern schools have also followed the trend of capitalization. Poor students are unable to enter, and even those with some assets can barely study in school, but whether they will have the opportunity to serve after graduation is another problem. Therefore, during their studies, the magic power of money invades their minds. Goldism naturally arises.</p>
<p>Under the teachings of Confucianism in China, interactions between men and women are subject to great oppression. The idea of "men and women not giving or receiving things hand-to-hand" advocates "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers" to determine the lifelong affairs of men and women. Modern students, influenced by new ideas, have been instilled with ideas such as open social interactions and free marriage. The old etiquette of the past must be fundamentally overturned in the hope of obtaining a happy marriage and enjoying the gentle blessings of beauty. Girls have become their target.</p>
<p>We often hear that some people cannot take the opportunity to apply to schools because they do not have a diploma. Even if they have a very good level, they cannot obtain the understanding of the school authorities. Therefore, most people value qualifications, such as when a university professor comes to teach, the first concept for students is whether he has studied abroad. How is his knowledge is secondary. This emphasis on qualifications rather than level of achievement is indeed forced on them by the system of society. Gradism has been created.</p>
<p>Some people say that students' three-G principles are a manifestation of educational bankruptcy. I am not judging whether what they say is correct. I am only pointing out the reason for its occurrence.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Classroom Sketch Meng Ping <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>When the students heard that there was a female teacher coming to teach political science today, everyone felt a kind of joy in their hearts and felt that this was something worth celebrating. School A, which had never hired a female teacher before, suddenly heard that there was a female teacher coming to teach us today, so naturally, a feeling of joy arose. Thinking of the male teacher's coarse voice, ugly face, and serious attitude, they hoped that time would pass sooner and waited for the political science course to arrive.</p>
<p>The bell rang with a clang. The director of academic affairs accompanied the female teacher into the classroom. The students held their breath and listened to the director's introductory remarks, saying that this female teacher was a graduate of a certain university, had novel ideas, and was knowledgeable. After the director left, she began to teach. When she asked the students if they had any questions, student Li stood up and asked:</p>
<p>"How many political parties are there in the United States? Teacher!" asked student Li.</p>
<p>"Two political parties," she answered.</p>
<p>"Which two political parties?"</p>
<p>"Two political parties."</p>
<p>"Which party is Hoover in?"</p>
<p>"Um... I'll talk about it next time!"</p>
<p>After saying the above sentence, she left with her books.</p>

<p>The Anglo-American troop deployment having been decided, they marched to Garden Lane (now Nanjing Road) at 3:30 PM that afternoon, raising flags and beating drums. From there, they advanced further to the area between today's Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road (formerly the eastern boundary of the racecourse) and stopped, awaiting the actions of the Qing government forces. Seeing that the government forces made no move, the Anglo-American allied forces estimated that it might not be possible to defeat more than two thousand people with three hundred and eighty men. They immediately felt disheartened, but since the troops had already been dispatched, they were unwilling to retreat and show weakness. They then divided their troops into two teams. The American troops attacked the front of the government forces from the left side of the racecourse, and the British troops advanced straight forward to attack the side of the government forces.</p>
<p>According to the eyewitness account of W.S. Wetmore, who accompanied the American troops, the American troops deployed two cannons between the graveyards, no more than two or three hundred yards from the Qing camp. At 4:00 PM, they opened fire as a signal to start the attack. The British troops also attacked at the same time. Suddenly, countless red dots moved extremely fast in the desolate grass of the mounds. These were the members of the Small Swords Society in the city who came out to help the foreigners attack the government troops. From this, it can be seen that the foreigners had agreed with the Small Swords Society in advance, so they dared to attack more than two thousand people with more than three hundred men. As the number of Red Turbans increased, the government troops' camp wavered and began to retreat.</p>
<p>The American commander, Skeli, took advantage of the situation to order a charge. Unexpectedly, they were blocked by a mud ditch. The ditch was fifteen to twenty feet wide and about four feet deep with water. It was the outer moat of the Qing camp. Inside the moat was a high wall six or seven feet high. The American troops were blocked by the government troops' artillery fire at this point and retreated to the cemetery. The American military action ended there. The moat that stopped the American troops' advance was called Zhoujiajingbang, which was incorporated into the boundary of Nichengbang many years later.</p>
<p>As for the British troops, they advanced straight ahead and encountered a bridge in front of Zhoujingbang. They then changed their course to the left and attacked the first barrack. Because there were cannons placed in front of the barrack, the British troops suffered few casualties. However, the deputy captain, Du, first entered the camp. The government troops had no intention of fighting for long, so they set fire to the barrack and left, retreating to the south of the county town.</p>
<p>The reasons for the government troops' retreat were: first, the Small Swords Society came out of the city to help the foreign troops; and second, they feared that starting a diplomatic incident would cause a major disaster. Moreover, the lack of military knowledge of Gilhangke and his inability to respond well were also reasons for the failure.</p>
<p>In this battle, the Anglo-American allied forces suffered two dead and fifteen wounded, two of whom later died from their injuries. The government troops also suffered no more than fifty dead and wounded. This is what is called the "Battle of Nicheng."</p>
<p>French Troops Assist Government Troops in Attacking the City</p>
<p>At that time, the county town was still occupied by the Small Swords Society. The obvious fact was that the government was concerned about cutting off aid from the concession. French Naval Commander Laguerre believed that the reason why the bandits in the city were resisting so stubbornly was because the British were secretly providing them with aid and blamed the British for not being able to strictly maintain neutrality.</p>
