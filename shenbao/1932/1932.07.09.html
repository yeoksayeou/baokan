<h3 id="c1">再論中國敎育之出路彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨評所陳要爲原則。今請更就此原則以規定實行之方針。</p>
<p>爲使敎育能臻於社會化與大衆化。第一全國各級學校必完全免費。在滿清時代學生入學。不　不納學費。且有膏火可得。共科舉制度。雖不可爲訓。但此種免費制度。要尚有可取者。即光緒二十八年張百熙　訂學堂　種。二十九年張之洞等改訂學堂章程。亦都不微收學費。至光緒三十二年兩江總督周馥咨稱。［學校收取學費。爲東西各國通例。］而徵收學費之章程。乃於以確立。時至今日。小學每年費數十金。中學費一二百金。而大學則達五六百金。金築之校門。事實上惟豪富之子弟乃能跨過。而佔絕大多數之勞苦大衆子弟。則惟有仰望龍門而長嘆。事之不平。孰甚於此。故今後各級學校。應一律免收學費。俾勞苦大衆之子弟。得都有求學之機會。而同時爲便學費之免收。無礙於敎育之進行。則敎育經費光必儘景擴充。確定其來源。並使其絕對獨立。對於各級敎師之待遇。亦必竭力改良。並保障其職務之安全。使其得以安心努力於其所事。其他如限期推行無償的義務敎育。肅清文盲運動。都應作整個之計劃。切實厲行。此其一也。</p>
<p>次之。爲使中國之敎育能（中國化。）不徒爲抄襲歐美敎育之皮毛。則第一必使敎育與實際生活打成一片。尤必使敎育與政治不相分離。故今後必普及政治敎育。提高人民之政治水平線。政治敎育之施行方針。則應使其能從日常生活中認取政治現狀之缺點。並認取社會之前途。同時更養成其集團生活之創造精神。鍜練其解放我民族。甚至解放全人類之奮鬥意志。換言之。即養成其推進歷史。創造新社會之能力。使下一代之國民。不爲舊時代之承繼者。而爲新時代之創造者。爲使敎育與實際生活打成一片。則應切實推廣農業敎育。勞働敎育。職業敎育。幼稚敎育。使勞苦大衆及其子弟。能受必需之敎育。使所學能得其用。同時所用亦得微之於學。一言以蔽之。舉凡自然科學之敎育。必以實用爲着眼點。絕對防止敎育之脫離社會而陷於空談。所謂實用。即爲改進我國家破落之經濟。並增進我國家之生產力。改善人民之生計。易言之。即使敎育接近我國固有之經濟情况。以增加生產爲中心目標。此其二也。</p>
<p>如上所述。要皆爲改造我國敎育之要道。循此以進。我國敎育之出路。或亦即在於茲。</p>

<p>德允放棄取銷戎首條欵要求</p>
<p>付欵額定爲三十萬萬馬克</p>
<p>於十五年内發行五厘債券</p>
<p>▲路透八日洛桑電英相麥唐納不肯放棄調和法德異見之希望、實爲此次奮鬥會議中特點之一、而昨夜張伯倫之宴待法總理赫禮歐與財長馬丁、亦爲一大手筆、赫禮歐經温和之勸喻、態度爲之軟化、於是英閣員急利用此機、邀德總理巴本外長牛賴資與法閣員及麥唐納會談、至午夜後始已、散會後、各代表皆困倦就枕、然復具有希望矣、目下之關鍵、全在條約短序言之文字、已起稿數十份、而經一一研究、聞赫禮歐願於戰爭禍首條文予德人以一種滿意之方法、各代表雖深夜始睡、而今日侵晨即興、麥唐納精神似頗健旺、巴本於晨十時抵英代表團總務處與赫禮歐討論修正條約序言、歷一小時延會、聞已獲有進步、但尚未切實商得同意、</p>
<p>續電云、德國應付之欵、已定爲五厘息債券三十萬萬馬克、以九十發行、實收二十七萬萬馬克、如不於十五年内發行、則發行債券之舉、即作罷論、此項債券、將以三十七年償清、</p>
<p>續電云、德國政治條文要求、與法國向德索取更巨歐洲善後經費要求、爲梗阻賠欵會議之兩大要點、數日來會議之忽明忽暗、皆爲此故、今已全行解决、條約序言措詞微覺空泛、且述及關閉以前之門戸、</p>

<p>過去與現在（四）</p>
<p>（四）亞林匹克運動會之意義</p>
<p>亞林匹克運動會之意義、至深且廣茲引且組織近代亞林匹克運動會之發起人法國古白丁男爵之言、以表明其用意</p>
<p>（亞林匹克運動會之恢復、在近代生活與狀况之下、每四年使世界各國民衆集聚一次、信賴和平與禮讓的競賽、可以組織國際主義之無上形式、）</p>
<p>（一切之前、可在競技運動中保存過去所使人崢嶸之種種高貴豪俠之特質、在今代人民敎育地位上享受古代希臘人民敎育所使人欽慕之同等地位</p>
<p>（競技漸漸散佈於全世界、並己替代青年生活上不健全之娛樂、與有害之遊蕩、人之在社會、必有其種種缺陷、眞眞的競技運動會、可使消滅其罪惡以促進健全之民族精神）</p>
<p>（亞林匹克觀念、進至何種程度、尚難判斷、但從其發創之各方面觀之、其定義之深、己彰彰明甚、（一）創造並增强文明國家和平聯絡之友誼關係、（二）澄清並消滅競技運動中之自私與欺詐之手叚、尋求人人能得公正判斷之遊技並使競賽不是以勝利作青年之歡樂、）</p>
<p>總之、世界亞林匹克運動會具有社會敎育與道德之三目標、社會方面使人於相互間能有瞭解精神、敎育方面、（一）使體育敎育爲積極與有理性之發展（二）設立公共體育塲及運動塲道德方面則提倡（一）運動應具之精神（二）羣衆之運動總而言之在護持提倡純粹之業餘運動、歷年之專心致志者在此、</p>

<h3 id="c116">宋子文與銀錢業商定 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>廢兩改元原則</p>
<p>▲俟政府取决即可實行</p>
<p>▲從此幣制有統一希望</p>
<p>財政部長宋子文、在未離滬返京前、曾於七日晨、召集本埠銀錢兩業領袖、於宋宅舉行談話會、除討論其他財政問題外、關於廢兩改元問題、討論甚詳、原則經宋部長與銀錢兩業協商結果、業已確定、專俟政府取决、即可研究進行辦法、</p>
<p>▲改元之動機據某銀行經理云、我國貨幣制度之不統一、早已成爲社會經濟一極大問題、改革之議、倡之已久、當日本實行金解禁及印度改爲金本位時、宋子文部長、亦曾有我國亦宜實行改金本位之動議、且曾向財政部外籍顧問凱穆爾·研究中國舊有貨幣制度、著一改革意見書、以便進行、徒因我國習慣、除銀兩而外、尚有一種規銀制度、欲事改革手績繁複、非急切所能辦到、故其議遂寢、至於此次廢兩改元之動機、一方面因鑒壓來幣制之太紛亂、一方面鑒於洋厘暴跌、適爲　兩改元之良機、故政府與商民、遂有此間樣之感覺、而毅然有此廢兩改元之議、</p>
<p>▲原則已確定當前日（七日）宋子文部長召集銀錢業代表談話時、對廢兩改元問題、因政府與商界、均同有改革之决心、故討論時、極爲順利、討論終結、則完全確定、其大要如下、（一）實行廢銀兩計算、完全採用銀元制度、以統一幣制、（二）完全採銀元制度時、舊鑄銀元、仍照舊使用、（三）一俟法價重量、每元究爲七錢一分或七錢二分之標準規定、即開始鼓鑄新幣、至於銀兩制度、實行廢止時、凡以前銀兩計算之往來、須俟政府取决後、再行討論詳細辦法决定之、</p>
<p>▲銀錢業贊同當討論廢兩改元辦法時、銀錢兩業、因久已感覺幣制不統一之痛苦、今後果能一旦廢止銀兩、專採銀元制度、不致再有銀兩劃頭匯劃之繁複手續、倐漲倐落之無形損失、對於是後金融往來、便益甚多、故當時中國交通中央浙江興業浙江實業上海銀行四行準備庫、及錢業代表、對此改兩爲元、劃一幣制之新機、莫不一致表示贊同、</p>
<p>▲實行諒不遠原則旣已確定、祇須俟宋部長返京與政府重行商酌、提付中央正式會議取决後、即可討論詳細條文、着手進行、據本人（某銀行纯理自稱）觀察趨勢、現在政府與商界、旣同覺統一之便利、且在洋厘暴跌之極好時機中、决心實行廢兩改元、諒稍事籌備、實行之期、當不在遠、預算日期、大約兩月之内、或可實現、</p>
<p>▲在滬鑄新幣此項辦法實行、新幣法價確定、財政部即須鼓鑄新幣應用、今造幣廠之在京者、廠址已燬、杭州所設者、亦己停鑄、故將來鼓鑄新幣時、决由上海造幣廠鑄造、聞上海造幣廠廠長徐寄廎先生、自中央委任以來、第一次遞出辭呈時、己由財政部指令慰留、第二次辭呈遞出後、亦至今未有批准、如此舉實行、當然即須開廠鼓鑄、故財部方面、仍屬意徐氏擔任云、</p>
<p>▲國外匯兌關係實行廢兩改元後、在國外匯兌方面、尚有相當之關係、蓋因用兩時、以英先令與銀兩之行情作匯價、改元後、對於鼓鑄銀元所用、生銀之成色及銀元之法律定價、均有相當之關係、故銀元於國外匯兌、其匯價當不致如用兩時之高低無定也、</p>

<p>房租減免標準</p>
<p>▲市政府昨日公布</p>
<p>▲房租減免辦法市政会昨日發出布告云、爲布告事、查本市自一二八事變以來、戰嘔　各處固受創深鉅、即毘連地帶、亦不獲安居、故各界人士、對於房租、咸認爲非酌量免除、不足以資救濟、而業主與居戸、以立塲之各異、斯主張之不同、彼此相持、糾紛遂起、設竟遷延不决、不獨當事者俱蒙不利、而地方秩序·社會安寗·胥將受重大影響、按租房本爲契約關係、原屬司法範圍、茲據雙方陳訴前來、對於免租之原則、均無異辭、惟對於免租之標準、同請釐定、本市長衡情酌理、博採輿情、爰定辦法四項、并製具圖說、提經市政會議决定公布、俾資準繩、各業主等、須知租賃物之使用收益、爲租金付與之前提、於法本有明文、於情尤宜體諒、而各居戸等亦須知、此次災害之負擔、不應盡加諸置產之一業、又何况本市置產情形之複雜、彼業主之經濟能力、未必盡如居戸之所言、深盼業主與居戸、抱相諒相助之懷、以達共存共榮之旨、國家社會曁市政前途、實利賴之、此布、計開標準辦法如左、（一）吳淞　·江灣·殷行·眞茹·彭浦·引翔·閘北·等區、（北區越界築路地段包括在内）免房租三個月、（二）特區蘇州河以北横浜以西、免房租兩個半月、（三）特區横浜以東·楊樹浦一帶、免房租兩個月、（四）滬南區及蒲淞區蘇州河以北部分、免房租一個月、</p>
<p>▲房捐免除一月市政府以戰區一帶居民、所受損失綦巨、爲體念民困、曾規定戰區减免各項捐稅辦法、公告週知在案、但其中規定實施區域、僅限於戰區及其毘連區域、茲聞市府以滬南區及蒲淞區蘇州河以北、雖直接未受戰事損失、間接上以戰事期内、居民不獲安居、頗受影響、現該區房租、旣經市政會議議决免除一月、而房指亦並酌量免除、同時經市政會議决定免捐一月、聞不日將佈告週知、并令財局遵照、</p>

<p>▲訂立合同　郵局載運郵件、與外輪訂有合同、向來由太古怡和等各輪、承裝至國内各埠者、今因扣至六月底止、有一部分合同已滿期、招商局爲國營輪局、與郵務同隸交部、故新總理李國杰氏與上海郵務長乍配林接洽承運郵件事宜、討論多次、雙方均認爲可行、草擬承運郵件合同十九條、經兩方面决定、業已簽字、而保證人局方爲李家　、</p>

<p>▲禁止赴日　日人排斥華工、久已成爲顯著的事實、滬戰以後、日人對於已經離東之華僑更乘機禁阻再往、而令滬上各日輪社發布通告、略稱、華人往日本各埠在購船票時、須將詳細住址營業開明、並帶許可入境之證明書到來、方可憑此購票、如無確實地址與證書者、槪不售票、並請勿往東洋、因不准上陸而退回時之船票、仍歸旅客自納、</p>
<p>▲東渡復業　戰時華僑歸國、匆促離日、多未報領許可再往之入境證書、今鑒日人已可自由來華復業、故近日江浙閩各籍之華僑、在日經營有商業者、均向日郵社購票、往大阪神戸長崎各地係往恢復商業、並結束店事、詎料未領燈書者、多不得乘船、僅有的保及許可證者始可赴日、</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>講到演化論的道理，其實也没有什麽了不得，達爾文的生存競爭說，我們也老早知道，大蟲吃小蟲，强吞弱，大家也司空見慣，不過没有將這些事實系統化罷了。</p>
<p>吾國古時也很多化生思想者，譬如莊子就是中國演化，論的代表。莊子書上曾載：</p>
<p>（莊周夢爲蝴蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也！自喻適知與？不知周也。俄然覺，則遽遽然周也！不知周之夢爲胡蝶與？胡蝶之夢爲周與？周與胡蝶則必有分矣。此之謂（物化）。（見莊子内篇逍遥遊）</p>
<p>莊子想入非非，在夢裏做蝴蝶，說是（物化），本來幼稚，神秘得可笑，然而和西洋進化論者認人是從猴子變來的，豈不是同樣可哂！</p>
<p>與（人是從猴子變來的）話頭異曲同工的，尚有莊子至樂篇一段：</p>
<p>（種有幾，得水則爲　。得水土之際，則爲毒蠙之衣。生於陵屯，則爲陵舄。陵舄得鬱棲，則爲烏足。烏足之根爲蠐螬。其葉爲胡蝶。胡蝶，胥也，化也爲蟲，生於竈下，其狀若脫，其名爲鴝掇。鶵鴝掇千日，爲鳥，其名爲乾餘骨。幹餘骨之沫爲斯彌。斯彌爲食醯。頤輅生乎食醯。黄輗生乎九猷。瞀芮生乎腐蠸。羊奚比乎不　久竹，生青寗。青寗生程。程生馬。馬生人。人又反入於機。萬物皆出於機，皆入於機。）</p>
<p>莊子的演化論比達爾文派的演化論。說得更要神秘，更要澈底，更要激烈！達爾文派的進化論說人是從猴子變來的：莊子說人是從馬變來的，那末，莊子的演化論豈不是更神秘麽？莊子不但說了（馬生人）而止，還倒說上去，竟說到（種有幾），豈不是比達爾文的（物種原始）更澈底，更激烈麽？然而猴自猴，馬自馬，人自人，事實告訴吾們，物各有種，眞所謂（風馬牛不相及）。</p>

<p>壬申春。日人攻上海。我十九路軍蔡廷鍇等禦之。相持月餘。敵由我邑劉河楊鄰登岸。我師左次。退婁城。敵從之。駕飛機擲炸彈如雨。族弟文荃婦馬氏。病不能起。竟中彈殉難於北城之北濠衖。尸體附牀躍起飛鄰舍。時文荃從軍於贛。兄文壽文萃先己分炊。至是逃散於鄉。越二日。乃成殮。凡見與聞者莫不酸鼻。越三月。其夫兄文治謹列事。載諸家乘。復和涙爲之銘。弟婦姓馬氏。字擷南。松江庠生馬君榖礽女。母夫人許氏。三歲而孤。依舅氏許君弼丞以居。先後肄業蘇州女校曁吾婁正則學校。年二十歲。來歸我唐氏。爲寄亭公第四婦。事舅姑盡孝。文荃奔走旅食四方。輒與婦俱。辛苦仳離。未嘗一日得曁息也。生子女八。殤者五。存者女慶泓子慶焯慶福。弟婦之卒也。慶泓慶焯侍於側。聞飛機聲軋軋繞屋角。亟命子女趨前樓避。猝碎然巨響。地坼天崩。樓傾。弟婦逝。母夫人許氏壓於竈下爐旁。慶泓慶焯駭絕。從樓櫺躍下。奪門出。則軍人塞路。慶焯呼救。一軍士持之去。逾日始得歸。慶泓皇遽奔毓婁校。見一軍官踰牆出。長跽哭告。吾母死矣。吾外祖母尚有呼號聲。乞往救。軍官遂率兵士於瓦爍　燼中曳夫人出。暈絕而就蘇焉。而慶福爲乳嫗抱育於鄉。踰月訪得之。傷哉傷哉。亂平己届夏至。始設奠成禮。嗚呼。弟婦一弱女子。讀書明大義。不能執干戈衛社稷。徒以病體支離。遽罹慘刦。而母夫人　獨無依。哀痛欲絕。九京有知。目不瞑矣。閘揚之責。非我而誰。銘曰</p>
<p>古來善戰服天刑。出乎爾者。反其身。降祥降殃善惡分。何期無妄罹災眚。飛鳥垂翼遺凶音。震屋蔀家幽不明。登天入地蒙艱貞。痛吾弟婦義行芳。以死殉國家之光。雷電晦冥毅　藏。　　俄闢含涕望。忍不能舍維高堂。閔斯稚子徂厥亡。目極千里春心傷。婁江恨水終古長茫茫。</p>

<p>木腿作保管庫英國有一個窮婦人。因病投入一家美國醫院。要求免費。一連住了五年。受醫生們極仔細的療治。不料正在療治快將期滿之際。却發見伊的木製的假腿。倒是一個銀行裏的保管庫。裏面藏有現鈔六百五十金鎊。合墨銀六千五百餘元之多。於是醫院中提起法律上的訴訟。要這裝窮的女病人照繳醫費與住院費。每天以一金元計。須付足五年。這爲數也就可觀了。</p>
<p>類乎這樣的保藏現欵。數見不鮮。曾有一個女性守財奴。在他的屋子裏的各部分。都藏著錢。東藏一千。西藏一萬。連伊自己也弄不清楚。後來伊死了。子孫要接受伊的遺產。只得將屋子完全拆毁。方始逐一的搜尋出來。</p>
<p>英國全國窖藏的金錢。據調查所得。約有現金或鈔票四萬萬金鎊。有許多人都是私藏在不可思議的地方。永遠不會流通。據一般經濟學家說。全世界經濟狀况的衰落。這種窖藏現金的守財奴。也須負一部分的責任。</p>

<p>— 自在</p>
<p>國民革命軍誓師北伐。至今日適爲六整年。當十五年七月九日。革命軍在廣州東較塲誓師。禮儀隆重。軍容甚盛。是日海陸軍憲兵黄埔軍校學生等。到者二萬餘人。吳稚暉代表中央黨部授旗。上書（實行打倒帝國主義的工具軍閥一。蔣介石鞠躬接受。當時全國民衆。飽受軍閥之壓迫。强鄰之侵略。渴望革命軍北閥之成功甚殷。故出師湖南。十月克復武漢。底定上游。十六年春。克復長江下游等省。十七年春。繼續北伐。六月克復北京。統一全國。至今已歷六整年。環顧全國民衆所處之地位。外有帝國主義者之壓迫。内有殘餘軍閥之煽動。頻年内戰。盜匪遍地。災荒洊臻。民生塗炭。靜言思之。慨其歎矣。</p>
<p>六年以來。外交内政。不堪回首。節錄當日中央黨部之出師宣言。以與今日事實相證。有以異乎。無以異也。且加厲耳。（中國人民之困。至今日而極矣。以言農人。則血汗所獲。盡供兵匪之掠奪。預征特捐。有加無已。終年辛苦。不得一飽。鬻田賣牛。寖成失業。兵匪所過。村里爲墟。老弱死於溝壑。壯年多被俘擄。男爲牛馬。女被姦淫。以言工人。則終日勞作。所獲僅能苟延性命。旣無餘資。又無保障。平時日日有失工之虞。災患一至。不免淪於流氓之列。以言商民。則外被洋商售賣洋貨販運土貨之壓迫。内受大小軍閥土匪苛捐重稅及明搶暗索之剥削。傾家蕩產。比比皆是。以言智識界。則敎者恒以薪金欠久。徒憂啜而不能傳其智者。學者每以匪患爲災。斷絕資斧。而無以進其學業。年年烽火。學校關閉。小學敎員。淪爲苦力。其他如各省軍閥部下之軍人。則多數本係農人工人。爲求生計。而投軍者。然而投軍之後。不但生計仍無所託。且爲野心軍閥驅而置諸死地。大好熱血。不用靖國離。救人民。乃徒以受軍閥拳養之故。反而屠殺人民。爲軍閥爭功名求富貴。世間慘事。孰有過於此耶）。（下略）</p>
<p>嗚呼噫嘻。時期雖隔六年。情形無殊疇昔。舉目河山破碎。傷心不忍重提。加以東北淪陷。版圖易色。革命策源地之廣東。在此國難當前。不惜勇於内戰。而於禦侮抗敵。則畏縮不前。革命軍人。顚倒至此。撫今追昔。重用慨然。</p>

<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>亡國。滅種。瓜分。全國人士聽之熟矣。知之久矣。而不意危機續發。亡國滅種之危。益迫於眉睫。内憂外患。交相侵迫。民國危。嗚呼危危。</p>
<p>東三省者。中國人之東三省也。而竟不能爲中國之東三省。南北滿之名詞。即日俄瓜分我東三省之一幅劃地圖也。哈爾濱南。日人之勢力圈也。否。是日人之屬地也。哈爾濱北。俄人之勢力圈也。否。是亦俄人之屬地也。而不意竟不止爲勢力圈。爲屬地。竟並中國人之居住權而亦奪之矣。是直不以人類待吾中國人耳、是可忍。孰不可忍。</p>
<p>吾民乎。吾民竟忍坐視日俄人之凌我辱我。致我國陷於死地乎。中華民國。武力換來之中華民國也。而竟無術對付暴鄰乎。吾民非人人皆存不自由母寧死之心者乎。不速籌抵制對付之法。吾民惟死乎。與其坐以待死爲奴隸。不如戰敗而死爲勇鬼。吾觀三色之旗。吾惟思於赤血中求青天白日耳。嗚呼噫嘻。）</p>
<p>中國革命歷二十年。而戴季陶先生。亦已爲中央幹部要人之一。同掌治權。乃國勢之弱。竟甚於前。有每况愈下之嘆。終清之世及經過軍閥政府統治十六載。滿洲爲中國領土之名義尚能保全。而反不能保全於革命成功之後。此又豈民黨諸巨子並季陶先生所及料哉。季陶先生於新聞記者時代。滿洲不過爲日俄兩國無形控制。猶發爲危辭。喚醒人民。謂與其坐以待死爲奴隸。不如戰敗而死爲勇鬼。今已握國家治權。可行其志。反力守緘默。九閱月來。祇聞其在北平雍和宫發起建密敎金光明道塲。消極的蘄求弭亂。欲仰賴無邊佛法。轉移刼運。以視二十年前之積極。判若兩人矣。載筆至此。我亦惟有以季陶先生筆下之（嗚呼噫嘻）結束吾文耳。尚何言哉。尚何言哉。</p>

<p>— 華聲</p>
<p>圓釘西名Ｗore　Mails鐵絲釘俗稱洋釘。按舶來洋釘。原爲法國之發明品。其輸入吾國也。亦以法國爲最早。故洋釘又稱法西釘。西曆一八八○年。德法二國。始以此項製品運銷美國。因適合彼邦人民之需要。業此者曾居奇一時。至一九一七年份。美國已能自製同樣之釘一千七百萬桶。一九二七年份。增至二千九百餘萬桶。從出品數量。推想到機械的設備。其爲宏偉。不言而喻。日本全國亦有大小釘廠三十餘家。其最大二家。附設於國營鋼廠之内。日出圓釘千餘桶。統計日本釘之年產量。約三百萬桶左右。除以少數銷售南洋及吾國東北各省外。餘供自用。美產巨量圓釘。因質佳價昻。不易推銷國外市塲。</p>
<p>最近十年來。國人提倡國貨。高唱入雲。各種機製洋式貨物。風起潮湧。應運產生。而圓釘一項。更爲時勢所需求。亦遂於斯時脫穎而出。</p>
<p>此項嶄新事業。鼎革後湖北有漢陽針釘廠之設。惜乎未曾出貨。即行停閉。據查吾國首先仿製而有成效者。爲上海公勤鐵廠之黄是甫氏。該廠所有大小製釘機器。均係設計自行製造。現在每月製釘一萬五千桶。爲本埠各釘廠之冠。其他中外大小釘廠。已有九家。每月總產額亦有四五萬桶之譜。足敷全國之需用。故年來洋釘之進口。除東北各省外。幾全用國產。公勤廠十年來艱難奮鬥之結果。不無少補於民生也。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>華聯社六日東京電，有田日外次，前日對駐日英大使明言，謂日政府在李頓一行未回日内瓦報告以前，决不擅自承認滿洲國，此事被日軍閥所探悉，甚爲憤慨，鳴鼓而攻，恐難留職，這句話在尋常看來，並未失態，或亦竟是事實，但在日軍閥的目中看來，眞是大失其體面了，因爲日軍閥的目中，並没有把國聯放在眼裏，并且口口聲聲欲退出國聯，今有田說李頓一行未回以前，决不擅自承認，則日人明明對於國聯，尚有一些顧忌的樣子，眞是不免失言了，</p>
<p>若照這樣說來，外交家决不能說一句老實話，是外交家的金科玉律，這一點不是我要讚揚我國外交家的厲害，他們無論外交失敗至若何程度，人民一批一批去請求發表外交的眞相與方針，他們總是矢口不移，說得官面堂皇，如何勝利，如何得策，决不肯說一句眞實的話，所以迭次交涉，勝利總歸我們，這是何等有面子的事呢，</p>
<p>并且我國不但外交家如此，無論那一個政治家，也是如此，大槪一做了官便没有一句眞話，今天一個談話，明天一篇宣言，多說得有聲有色，結果原是一張滑頭的支票，現在更加進步了，所謂談話等等，不一定要人去詢問，而一篇談話式的新聞早在夾袋中拿了出來，這一點亦是一件何簡便而省麻煩的事呢</p>
<p>所以我們的國有，完全是一個外交式的國家，無論什麽事，人民要知其眞相，是不容易的，大約還是孔老夫子傳授的心法，民可使由之不可使知之的一句錦囊罷，</p>

<p>— 丙耳</p>
<p>石版印刷之術，爲德人斯臘飛爾在一七九九年所發明，此石版含有炭酸化鈣之主要成分，與普通之石版質地不同的，石版面上是很光滑的，其質地由細微粒點組成，而且粒點中間有極細之小孔，功用爲吸收水分，其細孔非用顯微鏡，肉眼看不見的，石版之出源地，在德國素爾酵峯，該地當未發現此石可爲印刷之先，完全用以舖路，至曉得此石之功用，該地本爲枯瘠之區，一變而爲富源之域，而該地亦可稱爲世界產石維一之地，</p>
<p>通常所用石版之面積，爲長方形，厚約三四寸，除能吸收水分外，中之成分能與脂肪皂質能化合，一經化合，即能吸收墨油，若用阿亞伯膠液抹在石面，即不能吸收油，故欲印多色圖畫，除着色外，其他空白之地位，受了此膠化學作用，即可採除墨油，印出均能令人滿意，</p>
<p>牠之印法，將文字或其他花紋，用脂肪墨汁寫於複寫紙上，（複寫紙非通常所用之藍色複寫紙，石印所用之複寫紙，是一種透明的，與原紙相似）倒罩於石版上，以濕布使之潮濕後，轉動機器壓之，其文字即現於版上，再將此紙揭去，印出之字稍加修飾，即可印成物件，或直接用脂肪墨汁寫於石面，然此舉似較困難，因寫倒字不能如寫於複寫紙上，壓於版上之滿意，</p>
<p>印法上述兩種外，又如照此亦可使印成石印，印法以照屯潤濕後，覆塗有鉻感光性之亞鉛版，放在釃片器中，置陽光下晒十餘分鐘，待其感光後，取出亞鉛版，以墨棍輾全部，置火上略烘，後以薄棉浸清水輕洗之，則其未受感光的鉻膠均連同墨油爲水所溶，而已受感光的文字，或圖像的部份，能抵抗水分，吸收墨油，其影即留於亞鉛版上，不至再有脫影之弊，即用複寫紙覆上以墨油棍碾之，撒布樹膠粉末，加以硝酸亞膠製成的液體，這爲防牠脂肪畫線變了粗花綠故，等牠乾後即可印出原影，</p>
<p>印法已如上述，用後石版的墨跡當不能退去，要使牠退去可用松香油擦之即去，或用浮石粉擦之亦可，其印色可由一色至十餘色均可印得出的，</p>

<p>（今晚事忙麽？如果忙的話，那末明天又······）我們見面約略寒暄了幾句，他便這樣說。</p>
<p>（久别乍見，就忙也應當多談一回，何况不忙。）我雖然這樣答應他，總覺其（逐客令）武的問句，有些奇怪。</p>
<p>（先生！看相人來了！）茶房忽然推門進來好像報喜似的歡笑着說。</p>
<p>（這個！呃！請他們進來吧！）接着他又掉頭對我說（没有啥事，請看相的來白相相！）</p>
<p>（咯哆咯哆）的一陣清脆的革履聲響了進來，乖乖！原來是兩位天仙似的摩登女郎！那裏是我預料中的峨冠博帶的預言家？臉上塗着鉛粉和胭脂，唇膏厚厚地塗在唇上，洒在頭上幾乎下滴的玫瑰精，頓使滿室香氣襲人，蟬羽似的輕紗，隠約地顯露出嬌柔的温白的胸脯，綿軟的靈活的肚皮，以及那忸忸怩怩的屁股。我早已狠知趣的移坐於床沿邊上，讓他們好凑近談相。</p>
<p>（先生！眞是一付好相呀！天廷又飽滿，地角又方圓，蘭台廷衛又······）是一個較肥胖的女郎，用她的兩小片朱唇一張一合地說。</p>
<p>（龍虎相稱，其軟如棉的手掌，還加上這顆朱印和壁直的生命線，主其人大富大貴······）另是一個看手相的說。她的身材苗條，而且臉上常漾着柔和的笑靨。</p>
<p>相手相面，雖各不同，但他們的看相表情，都是差不多。譬如一面說，一面笑，又一面在指點着！也就是撫摸着。她們那美麗的整個的秘密和魔術，都在這些小巧伶俐的動作，微笑，面容，飛眼上一幕不同一幕的來演着。</p>
<p>局外人的我，表面上雖狠大方似的在靜聆高敎，暗地裏的心靈却一下比一下緊張的兀自跳動不住；何况任她們摸手指臉的他，縱是泥塑木彫的，也難免不神魂爲銷。并且實際上他已在目不轉睛地老是望着她倆，反似乎是他在替她倆看相的神情，後來她們甚至於不語不言，只是六只眼睛默默相視！</p>
<p>（呃嘿）我咳了一聲無痰嗽，把沈靜多時的空氣，而又緊張起來。</p>
<p>（對不住！）他笑眯眯地各人把給她十元錢！</p>
<p>（謝謝！先生眞客氣！）她倆便勝利的珊珊出房門去了。接着我問他何以一下車便知道這兩位高明的女相家，他便給我一張彩色廣告，觸目便是她倆（翊翊欲動的小照，上面寫着：</p>
<p>ＸＸ女士，與ＸＸ女郎，爲海上最有名之女相家也！如欲邀其同來談相者，無論在旅社菜館，書寓酒家，及一切公共塲所，飛柬相邀，無有不到。如恐遲悮，電話通知。倘蒙惠駕，尤所歡迎，特設雅靜相室，足供清談！相金兩元，出門不加。電話ＸＸ號，ＸＸ飯店。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Discussion on the Way Out for Chinese Education 彬· <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary presented essential principles. Today, let us further specify the guidelines for implementation based on these principles.</p>
<p>To enable education to achieve socialization and popularization, first and foremost, all levels of schools nationwide must be completely free. During the Qing Dynasty, students entering school did not pay tuition fees, and even received living stipends. Although the imperial examination system is not a model to follow, this free system still has its merits. In 1902 (Guangxu 28), Zhang Baixi drafted school regulations, and in 1903 (Guangxu 29), Zhang Zhidong and others revised the school regulations, neither of which involved collecting significant tuition fees. However, in 1906 (Guangxu 32), the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Zhou Fu, stated in a memorial that "collecting tuition fees in schools is a common practice in Western countries," thus establishing the system of collecting tuition fees. Today, elementary schools cost tens of gold dollars per year, middle schools cost one to two hundred gold dollars, and universities can cost five to six hundred gold dollars. The gates of schools, built of gold, are in reality only accessible to the children of the wealthy, while the vast majority of working-class children can only gaze longingly at the "dragon gate." What could be more unfair than this? Therefore, in the future, all levels of schools should uniformly abolish tuition fees, so that the children of the working class can all have the opportunity to pursue education. At the same time, to ensure that the abolition of tuition fees does not hinder the progress of education, educational funding must be expanded as much as possible, its sources secured, and its complete independence ensured. The treatment of teachers at all levels must also be improved as much as possible, and the security of their positions guaranteed, so that they can concentrate on their work. Other matters, such as promoting free compulsory education within a set time frame and launching literacy campaigns, should all be part of a comprehensive plan and implemented earnestly. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, to ensure that Chinese education can be (sinicized) and not merely imitate the superficial aspects of European and American education, the first thing to do is to integrate education with practical life, and especially to ensure that education is not separated from politics. Therefore, political education must be popularized in the future to raise the political awareness of the people. The guidelines for implementing political education should enable people to recognize the shortcomings of the current political situation from their daily lives, and to recognize the future of society. At the same time, it should cultivate their spirit of creating a collective life, and forge their fighting will to liberate our nation and even liberate all mankind. In other words, it should cultivate their ability to advance history and create a new society, so that the next generation of citizens will not be inheritors of the old era, but creators of the new era. To integrate education with practical life, agricultural education, labor education, vocational education, and early childhood education should be earnestly promoted, so that the working class and their children can receive the necessary education, and that what they learn can be put to use, and that what they use can be improved by what they learn. In a nutshell, all natural science education must focus on practical application, and absolutely prevent education from becoming detached from society and falling into empty talk. By "practical application," we mean improving our country's declining economy, increasing our country's productivity, and improving the livelihood of the people. In other words, education should be close to our country's inherent economic situation, with increasing production as the central goal. This is the second point.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, these are all essential ways to reform our country's education. If we proceed along this path, the way out for our country's education may well lie here.</p>

<p>Study the Northeast Problem</p>
<p>Military Occupation Has No Legal Basis</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Washington, D.C., dispatch: According to the research of American and French scholars on the Northeast problem, the current situation is that Japan is occupying by force, not by treaty. Military occupation has no legal basis. Even if Japan does not withdraw temporarily, it will eventually withdraw one day. It is not comparable to the alliance under the city after the war. Although the League of Nations has no military force to stop Japan from manipulating the puppet government in the Northeast, Northeast China is still Chinese territory in terms of legal principle. Even if Japan alone expresses recognition, other countries will definitely not take the same action and lose the credibility of the signatory countries of the Washington Conference. Moreover, although there is a call for recognition of the Northeast among Japanese military and civilians, there is still no fact of recognition. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<p>He Shizhen Is Dismissed, Zheng Tianxi Succeeds</p>
<p>Ren Shizhiquan as Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 48th meeting on the 8th. The following important cases were resolved: (1) Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs requested that Shen Guanghan and 32 other officers be appointed as commanders of the 66th, 61st, 78th, and other divisions, brigades, and regiments of the 19th Route Army. Passed. (2) Resolved that He Shizhen, the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, has not assumed his post for a long time and should be immediately removed from his post. Zheng Tianxi was appointed as the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, and Shi Zhiquan was appointed as the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice. (3) Ministers He of the Ministry of Military Affairs and Gu of the Ministry of Railways requested to revise Articles 5, 18, and 21 of the Railway Military Transport Regulations.

(4) Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs submitted a draft plan for the construction of railways and highways in Jiangxi Province, and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways submitted a plan for the construction of railways and national highways in the bandit-stricken areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, requesting review and implementation.

<h3 id="e34">Scheduled Implementation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Consular Certification of Cargo Manifests</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the consular certification of cargo manifests will be implemented from September 1. The fee for each cargo manifest, regardless of the value of the goods, is only five customs gold units (approximately eight national currency). Merchants can obtain it from the nearest Chinese consulate and have it certified by the Chinese consul, and submit it to the customs for inspection when declaring import. If a cargo manifest has not been obtained in advance, it must be obtained from the customs upon import, and a fee of fifteen customs gold units must be paid for each manifest. This certification fee is calculated per manifest and is similar in nature to the handling fee charged for certifying passports. The external rumor that this is an increase in the price of foreign goods is a misunderstanding. The motivation for handling this certification is to assist the customs in its administration, and the external rumor that it is to raise funds for embassies and consulates is also inconsistent with the truth. Furthermore, in order to facilitate foreign merchants, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will temporarily entrust consulates or chambers of commerce of other countries to handle the certification in overseas ports where there are few consulates.

<p>(Nanjing) Four groups, including the Fujian Overseas Chinese Compatriots Association and the Disaster Relief Association, sent a joint telegram stating that since the National Army entered Fujian, the Navy has seized power at the cost of selling itself. Yang Qu took over, planted his cronies and engaged in private interests. All facilities have adopted the principle of dividing the spoils. Levying tobacco seedlings and imposing exorbitant taxes and levies have resulted in cyclical disturbances by soldiers and bandits. The people cannot bear their fate. Recently, during the mutiny of the Communists, Zhangzhou and Longyan fell one after another, while the local warlords adopted a policy of non-resistance, taking the opportunity to load up and fly high. Other bandit-style troops watched the fire from across the river to compete for personal power. They are more than enough to harm the people, but not enough to defend the territory. Fortunately, the 19th Route Army has come to Fujian with orders and is expected to clear up the situation. If the politics are corrupt, as in the past, how will the post-disaster policies be implemented? The bandits may be suppressed temporarily, but the roots will eventually be difficult to eradicate. Our Fujian has been under the iron hooves of warlords, bureaucrats, politicians, and local tyrants for many years. Now, in order to remove the old and establish the new and improve the overall situation, only a fair, honest, and decisive person who can sacrifice everything can save this situation. Our Fujian's Xiao Focheng is of high age and virtue, and a pillar of the party and the country. If he is appointed to this difficult task, he will be able to bring happiness to the country and benefit the people. We sincerely hope that everyone will support this and facilitate its realization. It will be a great blessing for Fujian. In addition, the four groups sent a memorial to the National Government Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the General Staff Department, and sent a special telegram to Chiang, which will be sent within the next few days.

<h3 id="e60">Compromise Reached at the Lausanne Conference <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>General Assembly Scheduled for Today to Sign Treaty</p>
<p>Preamble Text Revised Several Times Before Agreement Reached</p>
<p>Germany Agrees to Drop Demand to Remove War Guilt Clause</p>
<p>Payment Amount Set at 3 Billion Marks</p>
<p>To Be Issued as 5% Bonds Within Fifteen Years</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Lausanne, 8th – British Prime Minister MacDonald's unwillingness to abandon hope of reconciling French and German differences was a prominent feature of this hard-fought conference. Last night's banquet by Chamberlain to French Premier Herriot and Finance Minister Martin was also a grand gesture. After gentle persuasion, Herriot's attitude softened, and British cabinet members seized this opportunity to invite German Chancellor Papen, Foreign Minister Neurath, French cabinet members, and MacDonald to a meeting, which lasted until after midnight. After the meeting, all the representatives went to bed exhausted but with renewed hope. The key now lies in the wording of the short preamble to the treaty, for which dozens of drafts have been prepared and studied one by one. It is heard that Herriot is willing to provide the Germans with a satisfactory solution to the war guilt clause. Although the representatives went to sleep late at night, they were up early this morning. MacDonald seemed to be in good spirits. Papen arrived at the British delegation's headquarters at 10:00 AM to discuss the revised preamble to the treaty with Herriot. The meeting was extended by an hour, and it is said that progress has been made, but no firm agreement has yet been reached.</p>
<p>Continuation Telegram: The amount Germany is to pay has been set at 3 billion marks in 5% interest-bearing bonds, to be issued at 90, yielding 2.7 billion marks. If the bonds are not issued within 15 years, the bond issuance will be cancelled. These bonds will be paid off in 37 years.</p>
<p>Continuation Telegram: Germany's demands regarding political clauses and France's demands for even greater European postwar recovery funds from Germany are the two major obstacles to the reparations conference. The ups and downs of the conference in recent days have been due to this. Now they have been completely resolved. The wording of the treaty's preamble is slightly vague and refers to closing the doors to the past.</p>
<p>It was officially announced this afternoon that a complete agreement has actually been reached on the reparations conference. British Prime Minister MacDonald is scheduled to go to London tomorrow night.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Lausanne, 8th – The British and French sides are deeply pleased with the conclusion of the agreement. At the end of the meeting, the German Chancellor also congratulated Herriot. The signing ceremony is scheduled for Saturday morning.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Lausanne, 7th – Reliable sources learned late tonight that Germany has abandoned its political condition of demanding the abolition of the war guilt clause in the treaty, but hopes to reduce the amount of compensation paid to within 2 billion marks. Before this news was released, it was widely rumored that both sides had already reached an agreement on the war guilt clause, and the draft agreement was expected to be completed before tomorrow, so that the final meeting could be held tomorrow or Saturday night. It was later learned that the reported agreement was essentially Germany agreeing to drop its demands. It was also said this evening that the agreed-upon solution to the war debt issue between various countries is effectively an extension of the temporary moratorium on war debt payments declared on June 16. This agreement will be the third type of agreement in the Lausanne Agreement, containing four documents: one is the general agreement, two is the gentleman's agreement (that is, no agreement text will be approved before the war debt is resolved), three is the British-French agreement document, and four is the official letter to Germany notifying them of the gentleman's agreement.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Lausanne, 8th – British, German, and French representatives negotiated through the night, hoping to reach a final agreement, but the most important treaty since the Treaty of Versailles, which they were discussing, was not drafted by dawn. Since the representatives to the reparations conference gathered in Lausanne, Lausanne has been known as a place of mixed joy and fear. Yesterday was no exception. At times, the hope was excellent, but soon after, the hope vanished. The representatives, especially British Prime Minister MacDonald, have been extremely diligent. At times, it seems that they can rest, but they still cannot. Yesterday afternoon, it was heard that a solution to the issue of responsibility for the war had been agreed upon. There was talk of mutual concessions on the points of contention, and the French and German representatives were also heard to have reached a compromise on the other important issue of Germany's compensation for European economic recovery funds, deciding on an amount below 3 billion marks. Judging from the above news, it seems that the door to drafting an agreement has been opened, and the draft agreement can be signed by Saturday or Sunday at the latest. However, a very promising day of negotiations took a turn for the worse again at night. It was heard that the negotiations to reconcile French differences and remove obstacles to bargaining were not as satisfactory as expected. While experts were considering the details of the treaty and its annexes, French Premier Herriot requested to read the full draft before discussing the amount. A semi-official German statement last night criticized the French for being stubborn, causing the German hopes of dealing with the reparations issue in the grand scheme of European recovery and restoring mutual trust by deleting unfair clauses in the Treaty of Versailles to be thwarted. Therefore, it is necessary to seek a solution on the narrow basis of reparations only. Discussions will proceed on this matter. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain hosted a banquet for French Premier Herriot and Finance Minister Martin last night, and it was hoped that the talks during the banquet would facilitate the progress of the agreement. German Chancellor Papen and Finance Minister Neurath, after going to bed, got up again to go to British Prime Minister MacDonald's residence. It was midnight, and MacDonald, suffering from a headache, was already asleep. Upon hearing that the German representatives had arrived, he got up and had a long conversation, which lasted until 1:10 AM. At this time, the German representatives told the press that the situation had progressed. After the British and German representatives dispersed late at night, British Foreign Secretary Simon and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain immediately drove to meet with the French representatives, rushing through the night, intending to inquire about the French side's opinion on the draft of a certain political clause. The talks ended at 2:45 AM. After the British representatives left the hotel, Herriot told reporters that progress was good, but an agreement could not be reached until several difficulties were resolved. The representatives were extremely tired. After getting the necessary sleep, they will continue negotiations tomorrow.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Lausanne, 7th – The reparations negotiations between the small countries of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Austria, Hungary, and Greece and the reparations negotiations between the six major powers are proceeding simultaneously here. Tonight, it was heard that the negotiations among the small countries have been completed. The agreed-upon final report stipulates that all debts arising from the treaty will be temporarily suspended until a special committee is organized to seek a final settlement. The members of the committee have not yet been announced, but it is expected that it will proceed concurrently with the World Economic Conference. However, its report must be completed by mid-December at the latest.</p>

<p>Holds Public Meeting</p>
<p>Discussing the Hoover Plan</p>
<p>Multiple National Representatives Enthusiastically Support</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 8th – Nine countries, including China, Mexico, Sweden, Persia, Armenia, Romania, Venezuela, Argentina, and New Zealand, have already accepted the principles of the Hoover disarmament plan in the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 7th – The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference met today. Representatives from Canada, Belgium, Brazil, Turkey, Cuba, Austria, Dominica, Finland, Hungary, Denmark, and other countries spoke one after another, with similar meanings, all enthusiastically supporting Hoover's proposal to reduce armaments by one-third and explaining the necessity of national security and managing armaments.</p>
<h3 id="e63">British Representative Distributes Paper of Opinions <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Believes Naval Section Needs Revision</p>
<p>The British delegation distributed a paper of opinions from the British government on the Hoover proposal to the representatives. All parties believed that it made a considerable contribution to the future of the conference. The British desire to implement the Hoover plan was especially welcomed. The British here believe that the most important part of the Hoover proposal is to reduce naval armaments, and they hope that the major countries will discuss the best way to implement this reduction. Britain is willing to do its best to promote its realization.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 7th – British Lord Privy Seal Baldwin gave a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon on the disarmament issue, claiming that Britain welcomes President Hoover's plan but cannot accept it unconditionally and believes that the naval section needs to be greatly revised. He meant that limiting the size and gun caliber of warships is better than limiting the number of ships, as stated in a previous telegram. Baldwin finally declared that he intends to limit the tonnage of battleships to 22,000 tons per ship, with a maximum gun caliber of no more than 11 inches. The tonnage of cruisers should be limited to 7,000 tons per ship, with a maximum gun caliber of no more than 6.1 inches. Aircraft carriers should not exceed 22,000 tons per ship, and the maximum gun caliber is also limited to 6.1 inches.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 7th – Today, Secretary of State Stimson issued a statement saying that Baldwin's remarks in the British House of Commons seemed to indicate that the Disarmament Conference gained momentum after President Hoover's plan was announced. In fact, President Hoover's purpose in proposing the American proposal was precisely this. We welcome the British government's suggestions as an expression of the same spirit. We have not yet received the details of Baldwin's remarks, so we cannot comment on them. However, it seems that there are suggestions for changes in the world's navies, and if the important parts of the fleet are to be remodeled, it can be seen that this proposal will not be implemented immediately at least. The British suggestion seems to be an ideal to serve as a standard for future construction. We will study it with great attention when we receive its full text, because we are convinced that Britain and the United States have the same goals.</p>

<p>Japanese Authorities Dispatch Officials to Negotiate</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – According to an urgent telegram received by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry last night, 400 Japanese people working at a crab factory operated by Russians on Puchi Zhiniyi Island, on the west coast of Kamchatka in Russian territory, were suddenly surrounded and arrested by Russian authorities on the 5th of this month, imprisoned, and threatened with artillery fire. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry immediately telegraphed the surveillance ship Shunko Maru, which patrols that area, to rush to the location.</p>
<p>▲Japan United Press, Tokyo, 8th – According to authorities' speculation, the fishing industry on the west coast of Kamchatka has been sluggish recently, and 400 Japanese fishermen have requested pay increases and shorter hours. The Russian factory refused, resulting in a general strike, which led to Russian officials suppressing them. As Japanese-Russian fishing negotiations are proceeding smoothly, this action is extremely concerning.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 8th – The Ministry of Agriculture received a radio telegram this afternoon stating that all 400 Japanese fishermen detained in Kamchatka have been released.</p>

<p>Taxes on the Upper Yangtze River</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 7th – The Chinese incident was questioned again in the House of Commons today. Conservative Party member Lunn inquired about the illegal taxes on the Upper Yangtze River affecting British trade. Undersecretary Eden replied that, given the current situation on the Upper Yangtze River, it is difficult to negotiate about various harsh taxes. However, it is not just British businesses that are suffering. British representatives in China have repeatedly taken possible steps to ensure that British businesses do not suffer unfair treatment and will continue to work towards this in the future.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 7th – Acting Prime Minister Baldwin declared in the House of Commons today that the House of Commons will adjourn on the 13th of this month and reconvene on the 27th of November.

<p>▲National News Agency, Moscow, 8th – It is reported that the plane piloted by American aviators Martens and Griffin was forced to land in Borisov, which is fifty miles east of the Russian-Polish border and four hundred miles from Moscow. The two attempted to change course when the management system suddenly malfunctioned, forcing them to land. The plane was severely damaged. Fortunately, the two only suffered minor surface injuries and will take a train to Moscow tonight. The cause of the malfunction in the management system is believed to be due to the strong winds and rain when changing direction.</p>
<h3 id="e74">French Submarine Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Sixty-Six Officers and Men Become Food for the Fishes</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 7th – The French submarine Prometheus suddenly sank today during exercises 20 miles outside the port of Cherbourg. Of the 73 crew members, only 7 were on deck and were rescued by a destroyer. The remaining 17 officers and 49 soldiers all drowned with the submarine. There is little hope of survival. It is heard that Captain Dumeesnil was fortunately among those rescued. The submarine is now sunk on the seabed at a depth of 150 feet. It was on the surface when the accident occurred, and the portholes were all open. After suddenly sinking, it is believed that the submarine was filled with water. Although authorities immediately dispatched people to salvage it, the rapid currents made it impossible for swimmers to reach the submarine. The submarine has a displacement of 1,400 tons and was completed in 1930. The submarine's regular crew consisted of only 4 officers and 59 enlisted men. The rest were experts who were inspecting its operation during the exercise. It is believed that the sudden sinking was probably due to the water tanks being partially filled, causing the ship to be in a delicate balance between floating and sinking, resulting in a sudden descent. The same thing has happened several times in the past.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Cherbourg, 8th – The French submarine Bromize has been found, sunk 75 meters underwater north of Cape Levi. The salvage ship Atigriwa has rushed to rescue it.</p>

Yesterday's commentary on this matter stated that Manchuria's takeover of customs is tantamount to ignoring the powers. Japan has not explicitly declared war, but the result is the same as gaining success in war. Now, it is even manipulating a puppet government and secretly plotting behind the scenes, which is most noteworthy.</p>

<p>Gao You Tang's Sentiments</p>
<p>▲ Remarks Delivered in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Gao You Tang, a member of the Control Yuan, passed through Jinan this morning on the second Jinpu train to Ping. A reporter interviewed him on the train. According to Gao, the impeachment case against Wang Jingwei was drafted in Luoyang and sent to Nanjing to be submitted to the President of the Yuan (Yu Youren) to the Central Government. After the case was presented, Wang expressed dissatisfaction with President Yu at the Central Party Headquarters, which was a misunderstanding. The Organic Law of the Control Yuan clearly stipulates that the Control Yuan is organized by Control Committee members, and impeachment cases are initiated by them. The President of the Control Yuan is only responsible for submitting the cases. He cannot compel the Control Committee members to impeach anyone, nor can he prevent them from doing so. However, Mr. Yu usually works in a relaxed manner, but in the Wang case, he immediately submitted it to the Central Government upon arriving in Nanjing, which may have led some to suspect that he was deliberately trying to cause trouble for Wang. Since the case was presented, Mr. Yu has not been to the Central Party Headquarters or met with Wang. He often tells some Control Committee members that most of the presidents and ministers of the various Yuan have been impeached by the Control Committee. Every time I attend the Central Government meetings, those sitting around me are mostly those who have been impeached, and they all glare at me, which makes me feel very uncomfortable, etc. Mr. Yu is now very passive and enjoying himself in Shanghai. It is said that he will go to Shaanxi for disaster relief. The impeachment case against the Ministry of Navy will also be submitted to the Central Government. During the recent Shanghai war, the 19th Route Army fought bravely, while the Navy stood idly by and even made an agreement with the Japanese Admiral Shiozawa that they would not fire a single shot as long as the shells did not land on naval ships. The 19th Route Army asked to borrow anti-aircraft guns, but they refused, not even a single iron plate. It is truly outrageous. Their usual corruption is too much to bear. The war fleet is not on the ships but is growing opium in Fujian, taking advantage of their power to oppress the people. President Yu often says, "Why should we use the blood and sweat money of the entire nation to support the rice bowls of the people of Fujian?" Because the current Navy has become the domain of the people of Fujian. We advocate fundamentally abolishing the Navy and selling the ships to merchants as merchant ships. To waste over a million dollars a year is the same as having no navy. Why not free up this amount and add the proceeds from the sale of the ships to purchase two hundred submarines? You should know that the Chinese Navy never hopes to attack others. Defending the sea lanes with two hundred small submarines is much better than having many useless warships. In short, the Control Yuan has proposed many impeachment cases, but they cannot be effectively punished because the Central Disciplinary Committee can only punish officials of the recommended rank. Officials above the simplified rank cannot be punished, and those below the appointed rank should be punished by the provincial governments as a matter of course. Looking back over the past two years, although impeachment cases have piled up several feet high, only a dozen or so county magistrates have been punished. For example, the impeachment case against Zhang Xueliang, although passed, cannot be implemented to this day due to the lack of a disciplinary body. Among the provinces, Shandong has the best politics, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also good. Apart from these, there is virtually no place without corrupt officials. The county magistrate of Qing County, Hebei Province, falsely accused good people of being thieves, abused torture, and forced people to death. After the Tianjin District Court fought for justice, he was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he still refused to accept the verdict and appealed. In the southern three prefectures, there was even a county magistrate who openly raped a civilian woman. Servants and orderlies can all become county magistrates, and even movie stars can write letters to recommend county magistrates. Such things are too numerous to count. We cannot impeach them all. What hope is there for the future of Chinese politics? Among the Control Committee members who propose impeachment cases, northerners are the majority, such as Yu Hongqi of Qixia, Shandong, and Shao Hongji of Yutian, Hebei, who are particularly outstanding (Gao You Tang is from Tieling, Liaoning). As a result of the Control Yuan's efforts to argue against the amnesty, the Legislative Yuan finally passed the clause (no amnesty for corruption). If corruption can also be pardoned, those who are corrupt will become even more unscrupulous. Judging from the situation, the public sale of opium will likely become a reality. To use the proceeds for defense against aggression is, in all fairness, not unacceptable, but I fear that all the income will still end up in private pockets. China's finances are undoubtedly extremely difficult, but the problem is the lack of revenue-generating agencies. The salary of a Control Committee member is only seventy-five yuan for four months, which is less than that of a clerk in a revenue-generating agency. What else can be said? ) When Gao spoke, he was very excited. Finally, he asked the reporter whether freedom of speech was possible in Shandong. He also said that the freedom of speech in the Beijing and Shanghai journalistic circles was far inferior to that of Shandong. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Bandit Situation on the Fujian Border <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Communist bandits in western Fujian have moved to southern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>▲ Factional bandits led by Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping crossed the Xianxia Ridge into Fujian.</p>
<p>▲ The situation in Quanzhou suddenly becomes tense.</p>
<p>▲ Fang Shengtao goes to Beijing to discuss the pacification issue.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Red bandits entrenched in western Fujian are planning to flee back to southern Jiangxi because the 19th Route Army has successively arrived in southern Fujian and is about to launch a large-scale attack to suppress them. It is said that Zhu De convened a meeting of senior bandit leaders in Ruijin and decided to move all the pseudo-military and political organs in Tingzhou to the ancient city on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. All the baggage was also moved to Ruijin. Zhu himself was stationed in the ancient city to preside over everything. The pseudo-16th, 18th, 20th, and 3rd armies in Fujian were all under the command of Luo Binghui, who deployed defenses from Tingzhou to Shuikou Hetian, with a battle line spanning more than a hundred miles, preparing for a final resistance against the 19th Route Army. If they cannot win, they will retreat with their entire force. Only the local Red Guards in Longyan, Liancheng, and Shanghang occasionally cause disturbances and make small contacts with the local militias. The factions of Red bandits led by Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping, who had been disturbing the borders of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, were recently ambushed by the Jiangxi army led by Wang Jinwen and the Zhejiang army led by Zhao Guantao in the four counties of Shangrao, Qianshan, Yushan, and Changshan. They fled to the Xianxia Ridge on the borders of Zhejiang's Jiangshan and Jiangxi's Guangfeng, where they held the dangerous terrain. Wang and Zhao's armies also pursued closely and advanced to Hekou in Guangfeng and Xiakou in Jiangshan, blocking traffic in the bandit area and cutting off supplies on the ridge. At the same time, they telegraphed Liu Heding's division in northern Fujian to send troops to block the bandits and prevent them from invading the Fujian border. After receiving the telegram, Commander Liu immediately ordered the three brigade commanders, Liu Shangzhi of Chong'an, Zhou Zhiqun of Guangze, and Qian Yuguang of Pucheng, to deploy defenses tightly and informed them of the unit numbers and flags of the bandit suppression troops in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces so that they could coordinate the suppression. However, Fang and Shao's factions, realizing that it was not a long-term plan to be trapped on the ridge, suddenly led more than a thousand people on June 30 to cross the Xianxia Pass and invade the northern border of Pucheng. On July 2 and 3, they successively captured the key points of Niankeng and Panting. Liu Hanguang's regiment of Qian Yuguang's brigade was repeatedly defeated in battle, and the bandits advanced rapidly, approaching the county seat, declaring that they would launch a general attack in five days. Currently, only Nie Jinlong's regiment is deployed to defend the county seat and its suburbs, and the situation is extremely tense. On the 4th, the provincial government received urgent telegrams from various groups in the county, requesting that troops be sent quickly to provide assistance and protect the region. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government immediately telegraphed Liu Heding in Yanping, requesting that a regiment of troops be sent from Chong'an to assist. However, the local Communist Red Guards led by Zou Kui and Huang Dao in Chong'an took the opportunity to cause disturbances in the border area between the two counties and cut off traffic because they heard that Shao's bandits had invaded northern Pucheng. Therefore, if Liu's division sends troops to Pucheng from Chong'an, they will have to go through a fierce battle before they can pass. Furthermore, the provincial government received a telegram from the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province yesterday, stating that the people on the borders of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces were suffering from the devastation of Fang and Shao's bandits and were fleeing to various places in Zhejiang, in a very miserable state. They requested that measures be taken quickly to provide relief. The provincial government ordered the Civil Affairs Department to coordinate the handling of this matter.</p>
<p>The situation in the Quanzhou area has suddenly become tense recently. After Mao's division of the 19th Route Army was stationed in Quanzhou and Hui'an, Chen Guohui's brigade of the Provincial Defense Army concentrated its troops in Nan'an and Yongchun and forced sentries to be placed in the areas of Heshi, Fushan, and Honglai on the border of Quanzhou and Hui'an, and precautions were taken very strictly. Chen himself transported military supplies back to Jiudu in Nan'an and telegraphed the provincial government for a month's leave, entrusting military affairs to the newly appointed brigade commander Hong Wende. His attitude appeared passive on the surface. One day, rumors suddenly spread in the provincial capital that the 19th Route Army had clashed with Chen's brigade in Nan'an. Upon inquiry, it was learned that Anchu had not received this telegram, so it could not be confirmed. However, the people in Quanzhou strongly opposed Chen's brigade, and it was feared that they would not be able to get along peacefully.</p>
<p>Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet, and Fan Zongchi, advisor of the 19th Route Army, both came to the province from Xiamen the day before yesterday. Chen was discussing coastal defense issues in the lower reaches of the river with the provincial government and planned to stay for a few days before returning to Beijing on the Hai Chou warship to report his orders. Fan was preparing for the establishment of the Pacification Headquarters and had surveyed the Governor-General's office as the office. Fang Shengtao, acting chairman of the provincial government, is traveling to Shanghai and then to Beijing on the Hua'an Wheel to discuss all the measures that need to be resolved regarding military affairs and authority and the appropriation of military expenses after the Pacification Headquarters is established.</p>

<p>The Rice Market is Gradually Becoming Active</p>
<p>▲ Although the Water Level is High, it Will Not Cause a Disaster</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After last year's major floods, the farmers in the countryside were displaced, and other industries also suffered heavy losses. Unexpectedly, in the past month or so, there have been dangerous signs of rising river tides. Throughout the entire month of June, there were constant strong winds and heavy rains, mountain floods, and river water backflow. The customs water gauge has exceeded twenty-six feet, more than three feet higher than the water level in May. The low-lying areas near the river have become waterlogged. The newly repaired dikes of the county's Dike Works Association are made of unstable soil, and cracks can be seen due to wave erosion. If preventive measures are not taken, the consequences will be unimaginable. After discussions between officials and businessmen, it was decided that the county magistrate should order the dike chiefs and directors to prepare funds and materials for flood prevention within ten days. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Anhui Central and Southern Emergency Relief Joint Office to approve the transfer of 2,000 yuan of emergency relief funds allocated to the county for flood prevention expenses. Cheng Zhenjun, director of the Department of Construction, also urgently telegraphed County Magistrate Wu today (7th), ordering him to instruct the dike chiefs and directors to protect the dikes day and night to avoid accidents. Fortunately, in recent days, the weather has been hot and dry, and the water level has gradually stabilized, so there is hope that no disaster will occur. As a result, the price of rice in the city has also fallen by more than one yuan. Top-quality machine-milled rice is now selling for ten yuan and eight jiao, and cooked rice is around ten yuan. The future still looks promising. Rice merchants estimate that the highest price after the new rice is on the market will be around eight yuan. All industries in Wuhu are dependent on the rice market. After the disaster, the rice market came to a standstill. Recently, rice merchants from Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo have been eager to try their luck because they see potential for profit, so all industries are showing signs of prosperity. The provincial government also attaches special importance to the revenue from the export tax on rice and grain. The Grain Administration Bureau, which was reorganized from the Rice and Grain Inspection Office at Dasheng Pass, is concerned that the inspection may not be thorough, so the provincial government has specially dispatched staff members led by a part of the provincial security team to assist in the handling of this matter. However, the chambers of commerce in Mingguang and other counties have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting the cancellation of the Grain Administration Bureau because, in addition to grain, they are also levying an additional three cents on tax-exempt wheat, which is destroying the law and creating chaos, similar to the likin tax.

<p>Review of Various Divisions in Xuzhou and Bengbu</p>
<p>▲ Personnel Have Been Sent to Inspect the Li and Xu Departments</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In order to reorganize the national army, the Military Affairs Commission previously issued a general order to all departments to comply with the new organization and engage in reorganization. Recently, in order to understand the situation after the reorganization, the committee specially organized a review committee, divided into three groups, to depart for the review of the various divisions, and to distribute military pay. The director of the first review group is Major General Lei, a senior staff officer of the General Staff Headquarters. The review committee members are Zhang Shou, a colonel section chief of the Department of Military Administration, and Zhou Shengchu, a clerk. They are responsible for inspecting the 4th, 9th, 10th, and 83rd Divisions, which were the first to be reorganized. Lei and others arrived in Xuzhou from Beijing a few days ago to inspect the 26th Brigade of Zheng Zuomin's Department of the 9th Division under Li Yannian, and distributed military pay for June. Then, on the evening of the 5th, they arrived in Bengbu, and on the morning of the 6th, they took a boat to Zhengyangguan to inspect the 4th Division under Xu Tingyao. One regiment of Xu's division is stationed in Zhengyangguan, while the rest of the troops have gone to the front to suppress bandits. The vanguard has reached Yinxianji, not far from Lu'an. After Lei and others completed the inspection in Zhengyang, they are scheduled to return to Bengbu on the 7th to inspect the 25th Brigade of Li Xiangrong's Department of the 9th Division. The main points of attention are the inspection of personnel, horses, weapons, ammunition, clothing and equipment, hygiene equipment, as well as inspection of education status and military discipline. They are scheduled to complete the inspection and return to Beijing before the 10th, and then go to Shanghai to inspect the independent brigade of Zhou Kaixun's Department of the 9th Division stationed in Longhua. Also, Jiang Dingwen, the new commander of the Bengbu Garrison and commander of the Second Army, has sent personnel to Bengbu to survey the location. The army headquarters is planned to be located at the old site of Fengyangguan, and the garrison headquarters will still be located at the Chamber of Commerce. Jiang will come to Bengbu to take up his new post as garrison commander within a few days. (6th)</p>

<h3 id="e82">Suspects Arrested for Poisoning in Bengbu <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲ Five Men and Women Captured</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since the discovery of traitors poisoning wells in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, the authorities in various provinces have paid close attention. They have issued orders to their subordinates to strengthen prevention and arrest those who poison wells and punish them severely according to the law. The Bengbu Public Security Bureau had previously received a notice from the Anhui Provincial Government regarding this matter and ordered the various sub-bureaus to earnestly prevent it. Unexpectedly, at about 4:00 PM on the 6th, near a well in Bamuyuan in the Fourth District, a woman from Yancheng, Xu Liu, was seen covering the well opening with a parasol and making a gesture of poisoning the well water. She was caught by nearby residents and turned over to the police at the police station of the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau for preliminary interrogation. The woman confessed that she was from Yancheng, 42 years old, and lived in Sanyuan Inn behind the station, making a living by cutting paper flowers, telling fortunes, and selling medicine. She came with a group of twenty men, women, and children, who mostly lived in Fuan Inn behind the station. The police station dispatched police officers to Fuan Inn and arrested four people from Yancheng who came with her: Xu Zhensheng, Xu Zhusna, Li Zonggui, and Ji Changkuan. The rest were out. They were all escorted to the Fourth Sub-bureau, where they were preliminarily interrogated by Inspector Zhou Ruitang. Xu and others confessed that they had left their hometown to make a living by selling medicine and telling fortunes because of poor harvests. They denied poisoning the well. When asked if they were Japanese spies poisoning the well to harm people, Xu and others firmly denied it. The Fourth Sub-bureau suspected that Xu and others were suspicious. In addition to sending police officers to the back of the station to arrest the remaining accomplices who were at large, they escorted the five men and women in custody to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation that evening. As for the well near Bamuyuan, the nearby residents have completely drained the well water and deepened it to prevent poisoning. This matter has now caused a sensation in the city, and all the wells, large and small, in each district are guarded to prevent poisoning. (July 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Cholera Epidemic in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>▲ Cholera Spreads in Nanchang</p>
<p>▲ More Than a Thousand Deaths in Poyang</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, cholera has been discovered in Jiangxi Province. Initially, the situation was still moderate. After June, the weather gradually became hot, and the government had no sanitary facilities at all. People's knowledge of sanitation was also extremely lacking. The spread of the epidemic became rapid. After receiving a report from the Public Security Bureau, Xiong Shihui, chairman of the Provincial Government, ordered the Civil Affairs Department to convene people from all walks of life to establish an epidemic prevention committee, allocating 5,000 yuan to purchase vaccines for prevention, so that universal injections could be given throughout the city. At the same time, he also asked the epidemic prevention team of the National Government Flood Relief Committee to send Dr. Pan to Jiangxi to provide guidance on everything. In recent days, all personnel from various agencies and schools have been injecting preventive bacteria. However, the epidemic is still getting worse. For example, a certain store in Chuanjia Slope was owned by a certain Jia, who made a living pushing rubber-wheeled vehicles. He had three sons. Within two days, the eldest and second sons died of the epidemic. Fortunately, the youngest son went to the countryside and was spared. In a certain awning shop north of Zhuangyuan Bridge, a northerner who was obese and made a living selling sesame cakes died of the epidemic in less than a day. Yesterday, a certain Mr. Shi, the wife of the young owner of Yuanshenghong, was still in Lizhaxiang playing bamboo opera, and the next day she died of the epidemic. Such cases are too numerous to count. Furthermore, according to a letter from Poyang, cholera is also prevalent in the county. Within a week, more than a thousand people have died of the epidemic. The most tragic case is a certain firecracker shop in North Gate Street, where thirteen of the fourteen men, women, old, and young died of cholera in two days. Currently, all the coffins in the county have been bought up. Words cannot express the grief. This is truly a tragic tale amidst the floods and banditry. (July 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Zhejiang Province Business Tax <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Problem of Increasing Tax Rates Resolved</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Zhejiang Province is experiencing financial difficulties, so the Provincial Government specially presented a proposal to the Executive Yuan to increase all business taxes to the maximum amount (i.e., 10/1000). Merchants, believing that the tax levy was too heavy, repeatedly requested the Party and Government authorities to reduce the tax rate, and nominated eleven people, including Wang Zhuzhai and Xu Xinggong, to form a special committee to continue to make requests to the Party and Government authorities. Subsequently, the Provincial Party Department invited the members of the Provincial Government Business Tax Issue Research Committee and the special committee of the Businessmen's Association to have tea three times to hold informal consultations. The Provincial Government expressed its considerable acceptance of the commercial sector's request and submitted a request to the Provincial Government meeting for approval. The consultation decided to maintain the old tax rate principle of tiered taxation and agreed to reduce the tax on whole sales by half compared to retail sales. The old tax of 2/1000 will be changed to 6/1000, the old tax of 5/1000 will be changed to 8/1000, and the old tax of 10/1000 will remain at 10/1000. As for food and silk, which had old rates of tax exemption or tax reduction, they will continue to be handled in accordance with the old regulations. According to the old statistics on business tax, the old tax of 2/1000 was mainly for handicrafts, local products, and commercial activities with meager profits. The Provincial Chamber of Commerce believed that handicrafts and local products should be given special consideration given the current commercial depression, so they again nominated Wang Zhuzhai and Chen Qinshi to visit Zhou Junyan, the director of the Department of Finance, to request that the tax be further reduced to 5/1000. Zhou agreed to forward the request to the Provincial Government meeting for discussion and decision, to be used as a temporary measure, and to consult with the Ministry of Finance for record-keeping. It is heard that the total amount of business tax collected in Zhejiang Province in the 20th year of the Republic was approximately 1.1 million yuan. After changing to the new tax rate for collection, 2.3 million yuan can be collected annually. (July 7th)</p>

<p>Hailstorm Disasters in Xichuan and Other Counties</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: On June 28th, the Provincial Relief Association received a report from Jin Xi, chairman of the Xichuan County Relief Sub-association, Song Zuyuan, director of the 8th District Autonomous Office, and Chen Shunde, captain of the Security Team, stating that their county had been suffering from droughts and floods for years, and the people were not living well. This spring, the wheat was lush, and there was hope for a good harvest. However, on the 4th and 5th of May, there were torrential rains, and mountain floods broke out. All the wheat and peas on the hillsides, in the gullies, and near the river were washed away. The disaster-stricken people were hungry and miserable, digging up chicken heads, water chestnuts, and cotton jujubes to fill their stomachs. The state of exhaustion was unbearable to witness. They requested relief to save the disaster-stricken people. Furthermore, Wang Ren, the county magistrate of Ziyou County, reported that the county's terrain was low-lying and prone to flooding. Last year's flood was extremely severe, and it has not yet been restored. Now, there have been strong winds and continuous rain. In the highlands, the crops withered in the wind, and in the low-lying areas, the seedlings were submerged in the water. In the areas of Da'an, Neibu, Shiyuan, and Fantan, more than 8,000 mu were flooded, and more than 500 households were affected. There was no harvest of wheat, and there was no hope for the autumn harvest. The disaster-stricken people were clamoring for food, and their situation was extremely pitiful. They requested relief to alleviate the people's difficulties. Furthermore, Song Jianbang, the section chief of the First Section of Bo'ai County, reported on behalf of the county that at 4:00 PM on June 19th, there was thunder and rain, and hailstones fell like fists, small as eggs. The ground was covered with a depth of about six inches. The crops were destroyed, the houses were broken, and many fruits, trees, livestock, and animals were injured. The disaster was unprecedented. The wheat had not yet been harvested, and there was no hope for the autumn harvest. The future of the people's livelihood was deeply worrying. They requested that relief funds be dispatched quickly to save the people from fire and water. It is heard that after receiving the county's report, the Provincial Relief Association immediately telegraphed the National Relief Association and various charitable organizations, urging them to quickly allocate relief funds for assistance.</p>

<p>▲ Temporary Tax Payment Method for Tobacco and Alcohol Merchants Determined by the Provincial Government</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol license tax has been levied by the bureau since July 1st, with the assistance of county government announcements. However, Zhu Jiemeng, director of the Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, and Nanhui Five-County Tax Collection Bureau under the Ministry of Finance, also received a telegram order from the provincial bureau to continue collecting taxes as usual, causing merchants to be unsure which bureau to pay taxes to. Since the deadline for tax payment and license renewal will expire on the 10th, a late payment penalty will be charged in accordance with regulations. It is learned that Xu Yajie, Zhang Fujun, Ding Zhouzhi, and other chairmen of the tobacco, alcohol, and soy sauce trade associations convened a joint meeting of the same industries yesterday to discuss the tax payment method. After a public resolution, it was decided that since the orders from the Ministry and the Province are ambiguous, the merchants will deposit the taxes to be paid with the respective trade associations for safekeeping before a solution is reached. Once it is determined which bureau to pay, the respective trade associations will remit the taxes and renew the licenses, so that merchants will not be held responsible for the delay. This was unanimously approved, and the trade associations jointly sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, which was forwarded to the two tax collection bureaus for verification.</p>

<p>▲ Provincial Police Disturb Shanghai-Taicang Automobiles Again The Provincial Police officers Dai Zhensheng and others of the Provincial Capital Public Security Team beat up employees of the road bureau due to disputes while riding in the car, and the Jiading County Public Security Bureau sent Chief Inspector Jin Jishan to escort the car with police officers. Unexpectedly, when the third Shanghai-bound car from Jiading arrived at the Xinjing Tree Station at 11:00 AM, the provincial police stationed in the town negotiated with Chief Inspector Jin, saying that the Public Security Bureau did not usually send personnel to escort the car. Why are you here today? If we see you in the car next time, we will confiscate your firearms. Jin, fearing that the matter would escalate, returned to Jiading and reported it to Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua, who reported it to the county government. County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia ordered the fourth car at 1:00 PM to temporarily stop running and informed the platoon leader of the Provincial Public Security Team, Fu, who immediately ordered all the provincial police stationed in Xinjing Bridge Town to return to the city. The defense of the area was taken over by Gao Baozhen, captain of the county police team, who dispatched a team to take over. The fifth car at 3:00 PM then ran as usual.</p>

<p>▲ The Railway Police Continue to Seize Large Quantities of Opium Paste The Chief of the 4th Section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police in Wuxi, Guan Chongbi, along with police officers Wang Mingyu and others, discovered 103 catties of opium paste in the baggage room of the station on the 5th of this month. They immediately took into custody Liu Dingxin, a staff member of the baggage room, as well as Liu Fusheng and Yu Jinrong, two tea servers from the train, and interrogated them. They then submitted the case to the Joint Railway Police Department for further investigation. It is now known that a man named Zhou Changqian from Haizhou is currently working as a head contractor at the Nanjing Station. He is exceptionally shrewd in smuggling opium paste and has never been caught. On the night of the 7th, at 12:00 AM, the 26th passenger train from Beijing to Wuxi added two freight cars. Zhou again loaded a large quantity of opium paste into the freight cars. After the train arrived at the Wuxi station, the cargo was unloaded by the unloading workers at 5:00 AM yesterday (the 8th). However, two bamboo baskets of a reddish-brown color seemed suspicious, possibly containing prohibited items. They were spotted by railway police officers Wu Yue, Wang Xuehuai, Xu Qinghong, and Fan Jinrong, who went forward to inspect them. They immediately found seven packages of opium paste, weighing 34 catties and worth over 1,000 silver dollars. They then took the witnesses to the 4th Section of the Railway Police to await further instructions. Simultaneously, Station Master Zhang Mutao telegraphed the Shanghai Joint Railway Bureau to request instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Two Bureaus Collect Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses The various trade associations in the county, including the raw tobacco trade, the cigarette trade, and the liquor and soy sauce trade, are perplexed because two tax bureaus are simultaneously collecting taxes for tobacco and alcohol licenses. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting a prompt clarification for compliance. The telegraph stated, in brief, that they had read in the "Wuxi Daily" about a notice from the Wuxi Branch of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau, which stated, "Following the instructions of the Ministry, the tobacco and alcohol license tax for the 21st year will be handled as before, and collection will proceed as usual." Another notice from the Wuxi Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax Collection Office of the 2nd District of Jiangsu stated, "Following the provincial order, collection will begin immediately, and late payments will be subject to a late fee." Upon investigation, tobacco and alcohol license taxes are national taxes, directly collected by the Ministry, and uniformly implemented in all provinces. The trade associations are perplexed because two license tax bureaus in one county are collecting taxes simultaneously. They do not know where to pay and are frequently asking for clarification. They are therefore telegraphing for your perusal and requesting a prompt clarification for compliance.</p>
<p>▲ Raising 150,000 to Relieve the Famine Since its establishment, the county's temporary famine relief association has spared no effort in dealing with famine relief matters. The association has now decided to raise 150,000 silver dollars for famine relief. This includes using the existing reserve of 20,000 silver dollars, as well as approximately 40,000 silver dollars from half of the local surcharges for road construction, the deed tax special surcharge, and the slaughter tax special surcharge for the 21st year. In addition, approximately 5,000 silver dollars will come from one-fourth of the local surcharges on agricultural land, totaling approximately 45,000 silver dollars. 40,000 silver dollars will be mortgaged from banks and money houses. Another 10,000 silver dollars will be borrowed from the dike repair funds. A further 50,000 silver dollars will be allocated from the two-five treasury bond face value and cash holdings. Finally, 30,000 silver dollars will be raised through donations from local figures. The association will properly allocate all of the above funds. The allocation methods and famine relief steps have also been agreed upon. The association will use the 50,000 silver dollars from the two-five treasury bond face value and cash holdings to immediately establish poor people's loan offices in each district. They will continue to allocate 10,000 silver dollars to the county agricultural improvement field to purchase seeds for agricultural by-products, such as sweet potatoes, for distribution to farmers to provide some assistance. The remaining 90,000 silver dollars will be used to provide comprehensive relief to the seventeen districts of the county, based on the severity of the famine in each district. Yesterday (the 8th), the association also submitted the famine relief plan and budget estimate to the provincial government and various departments for record-keeping. They also requested permission to suspend unnecessary construction projects and allocate the land surcharges for construction specifically for famine relief to benefit the disaster-stricken people. At the same time, the association held its second executive council meeting at the county chamber of commerce. Fifteen directors attended, chaired by Li Dangping. The following important matters were decided: (1) The methods for lending to poor households in each township will be presented by the director of the care department, reviewed by Director Gao Jian Si and Director Hua Yinchun, and then submitted to the council for a public decision before being printed and distributed to each district for reference. (2) Continue to telegraph the provincial government and various departments to strive to retain construction funds for famine relief. (3) Send letters to each theater, requesting them to perform charity shows for three days to support famine relief. (4) Send letters to urge each district head to investigate poor households and report to the association within five days to facilitate the investigation and release of shares, and begin the review process.</p>

<p>▲ Joint Survey of the Dispute over Dredging the Xiao-Su River The dredging of the Longdai River in Xiao County is strongly opposed by the people of Su County, Anhui Province. The authorities of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui have sent personnel for a joint survey, but a proper solution has not been reached. Now, the Jiangsu Construction Department has telegraphed the Central Huai River Conservancy Commission, requesting it to send personnel for a three-party joint survey to ensure thoroughness.

<p>▲ Two Defendants Acquitted in the Case of Embezzlement in the Grain Transport of Jiangning Fan Zheng and Jin Xianzhi, clerks in the Jiangning Finance Bureau, were suspected of embezzlement in the grain transport and were investigated by the Finance Department, ordered to be taken to the province, and transferred to the court. After the investigation was completed, it was deemed that there was suspicion of a crime. The criminal court, under Judge Yang, conducted several hearings, summoned witnesses, and reviewed the documents. The two defendants, Fan and Jin, were found to have no major fault. On the 30th of last month, a judgment was issued that both defendants, Fan and Jin, were not guilty. It was discovered that Fan Zheng was suspected of smoking opium. Based on the anti-smoking law, Fan Zheng was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. It is now reported that the prosecutor has objections to this case and intends to appeal.</p>

The boatmen abandoned the boat and swam ashore on the morning of the day before yesterday, reporting to the local tax police and weighing bureau. Many tax police officers went to investigate and saw only an empty boat. The salt was floating on the sea, and there was nothing left. Suspecting that it was stolen by the locals, they immediately detained a suspect named Jia and sent him to the county for investigation. Then, they inquired extensively among the people near the sea, all saying that such a heavy ship must sink in a storm, and that the boatmen must have thrown the salt into the sea, so they could get close to the shore. It is reported that the ship was transporting salt to Liuhe, with a load of more than 8,000 catties of salt.</p>

<p>▲ Two Suicides Due to Economic Pressure Jiang Tongsheng, from Keqiao, Shaoxing, used to work as a hotel clerk in Shanghai. Due to the impact of the war, he had been unemployed for a long time. Yesterday, he came to Hangzhou to seek help from his uncle, Jiang Yuanhui, and his aunt, who ran the Xudasheng Rice Store in Baoyufang, to borrow money to find another job. Unexpectedly, he was ridiculed and scolded. Jiang was stimulated by this and went directly to Jianggan to take the Yidu ferry across the river. When the boat reached the center of the river, he jumped into the water to commit suicide. Fortunately, the old ferryman Zhou Ahong noticed and managed to rescue him and send him to the public security bureau for repatriation to Shanghai. Hua Huanzhang, from Shaoxing, was also suffering from poverty and illness and was unable to maintain himself economically. He also committed suicide by jumping into the river yesterday afternoon. He was rescued by the No. 8 Yidu tugboat and sent to the police station, which transferred him to the provincial relief center for assistance.</p>
<p>▲ Site Selected for Shanghai Arsenal In order to avoid being destroyed by the Japanese, important parts of the Shanghai Arsenal were continuously transported to Zhejiang Province during the Shanghai war. There was a previous proposal to convert the Hangzhou Mint into an arsenal. At that time, Wang Zhuzhai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to Chen Gongxia, the Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, requesting him to withdraw the order. Chen replied and cancelled the proposal. Now, the central authorities of the factory have decided to move to Hangzhou. A few days ago, Hu Sihong, the director of the inspection department of the factory, and Lin Weirong, the director of the ammunition factory, came to Hangzhou to look for a factory site. They have already selected a site near the Zhakou area. In terms of transportation, there are five or six sections of buses that can pass through the area. It is planned to purchase 300 mu of land, with a price of 50 yuan per mu. The construction cost is estimated to be about 500,000 yuan. The project will take about half a year to complete.

<p>▲ Improvement of the Academic Systems of Art and Music Schools</p>
<p>Liu Haisu has been in Beijing for several days to discuss the preparation for the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition and the Second National Art Exhibition. He has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Education regarding the improvement of the academic systems of art and music schools at the conference of presidents of colleges and universities convened by the Ministry of Education on the 10th of this month. An excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>Our country's art and music schools are classified as category D specialized schools with a set three-year graduation period, similar to vocational schools of industry and commerce. Art and learning are the crystallization of thought and are sufficient to express national characteristics and the spirit of the times. Therefore, the goal of art and music schools in Europe and the United States is to cultivate art experts, with no fixed time limit. Their research process is similar to that of universities. From Haisu's experience, I feel that the nature of art and music schools is very different from that of other vocational specialized schools. Therefore, a three-year term is too short. It would be laughable to apply the study period of ordinary bookkeeping to students of literature and philosophy. Although our country is currently in a period of transition and does not need to seek perfection in everything, a clear distinction must be made between advanced academic learning and ordinary technology. In the field of art and music schools, whether training teachers or experts, they cannot be compared with ordinary vocational technology. In order to meet the urgent needs of society, for example, teachers of music, painting, and handicrafts can be trained quickly and regarded as similar to vocational technology, but advanced academic learning must be treated separately and cannot be mixed. In Haisu's humble opinion, the study period for art and music schools should be at least five years, and they should be changed to independent colleges. The departments attached to them for training teachers may be slightly shortened. Compared to European countries, this is already a compromise. If we consider that advanced academic learning cannot be borrowed and that students should not be superficial, then the improvement of the academic system is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed.</p>

<p>The Work Department includes five tasks: school affairs, family affairs, morning affairs, crafts, and business affairs. It occupies an important position in elementary school education. Since the promulgation of the Provisional Curriculum Standards, most elementary schools in various regions have been unable to implement them according to the standards due to various problems such as personnel and equipment. In view of this, the Hangzhou City Education Department planned to hold a work achievement exhibition. Over the past year, the elementary schools under the jurisdiction of Hangzhou City have paid great attention to the development of work teaching. A large-scale exhibition was held at the Provincial High School from July 5th to 10th. More than 100 schools participated, with achievements in 17 parts and more than 60 or 70 rooms. Thousands of people visited the exhibition every day. The city government specially invited experts Jiang Danshu, Ni Zhuhua, Zong Lianghuan, and Chen Wangdou to the exhibition to review the achievements. Zong and Ni also gave lectures to guide the implementation of the Work Department.

<h3 id="e103">Starting in June, the Municipal Bureau of Education <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Fully Pays Teachers and Staff of Municipal Schools</p>
<p>Since January 28th, Shanghai's municipal revenue has sharply decreased, resulting in a shortage of education funds. However, municipal schools, except in the war zone, have been able to maintain classes, which shows the efforts of the administrative authorities and teachers and staff. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, has praised the difficult lives of teachers and staff of municipal schools and their loyalty to their duties. Yesterday, he submitted a request to Mayor Wu to fully pay salaries starting in June, taking into account the current situation of each school. The municipal government believes that the financial situation of the municipal treasury has reached its limit. The Education Bureau has previously submitted three requests to issue 70% of the salaries starting in May, but none of them have been approved. In order to consider the lives of ordinary teachers and staff, Director Xu repeatedly discussed the matter with Mayor Wu. It is reported that the mayor has agreed with great difficulty.</p>
<p>Another report stated that teachers and staff of the city previously went to the Municipal Bureau of Education to petition for the supplementary payment of salaries. At that time, the director was out on official business and could not meet them. On the 6th, the Education Bureau summoned the principals and teacher representatives of various schools to the bureau. The mayor's representative and the director earnestly explained the difficult situation of the city's financial difficulties and the inability to pay full salaries, and promised to find a way within the possible range. At 11:00 AM on the 7th, when teacher representatives Li Bojun and others went to the Education Bureau, Director Xu reiterated that full salaries could be paid starting in June. The issue of the municipal school teachers and staff requesting supplementary salaries has come to an end. Yesterday, the municipal school authorities convened a joint conference of principals and teacher representatives, attended by Zhao Luqing, principal of Xicheng Elementary School, Liu Yinqian, principal of Wanzhu Elementary School, Yang Jingyi, principal of Shangwen Elementary School, and the teacher representatives from these 23 schools, Qian Cijiu, Hu Huaitian, Wu Yinchun, and others, totaling 47 people. The group first elected Li Bojun, Xu Ziling, and Qian Cijiu as the presiding officers, who reported on the experience of going to the Municipal Bureau of Education to make a request. After the report was completed, the following was discussed: (1) It was resolved that no more general meetings would be convened this afternoon. (2) It was resolved to designate Li Bojun, Hu Huaitian, Xu Zihua, Zhao Luqing, Zhou Peicheng, and others as nine representatives to go to the Municipal Bureau of Education to petition and request the director to give a concrete and responsible reply regarding the full payment of salaries for May, June, and July. The representatives went to the Municipal Bureau of Education at 3:00 PM to make a request. The director personally met them and expressed acceptance of the requests made by the representatives. He solemnly declared that full salaries could be paid starting in June. The director would also do his best to report the difficult living conditions of the teachers and staff to the mayor regarding the salaries for May. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e108">Shanghai Municipal Post-War Reconstruction Education Plan (1) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday drafted a "Shanghai Municipal Post-War Reconstruction Education Plan" as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Importance of Post-War Education Reconstruction</p>
<p>Since the invasion of Shanghai by the brutal Japanese army, the residences in Zhabei and other places have been reduced to ruins, and the education sector has been completely destroyed. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed and the national territory has been recovered, residents who fled are gradually returning to their hometowns. Although we must caress the wounds, we must also learn from the pain. As Shanghai is a world market, the focus of attention both at home and abroad, if we can actively restore various industries in a short period, we can make the friendly countries of the world understand the resilience and spirit of the Chinese nation. Moreover, the education sector, which nurtures and trains the people, cannot be delayed. Therefore, the importance of post-war education reconstruction is self-evident.</p>
<p>2.  The Scope of Post-War Education Reconstruction</p>
<p>The scope of post-war education reconstruction will tentatively include Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong.</p>
<p>3.  The Timeframe for Reconstruction Completion</p>
<p>The timeframe for reconstruction completion is indeed an important issue. Too long would be too slow, and too short would exceed our financial capabilities. After careful consideration, it is proposed to proceed in three phases, each lasting one to one and a half years.</p>
<p>4.  Types of Education</p>
<p>Post-war education reconstruction is divided into two major parts: school education and social education. They are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The School Education Reconstruction Plan is tentatively divided into three items:</p>
<p>(1) Number of schools to be established, (2) Location of schools to be established, and (3) School buildings and equipment. They are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Number of Schools to be Established</p>
<p>The Zhabei area can be divided into two parts: one is the area destroyed by the war, and the other is the area affected by the war. The destroyed area is north of the Jinghu Railway, including Qiujiang Road, Yongxing Road, Xiangshan Road, Zhongxing Road, and Zhonghua New Road, which have now become scorched earth. In this area, there were seven municipal schools, including Jiancheng, Huifeng, Peiben, Lubin, Yude, Zhabei Kindergarten, and Dexin, with a total of 31 classrooms and accommodating more than 2,000 students. There were also dozens of private elementary schools with approximately 10,000 students. This time, the school buildings of the municipal and private schools have been severely damaged. Because most of the houses in the area have been burned down, it will take some time for all the residents to return. It is proposed that in the first phase, one middle school specializing in commerce, two complete elementary schools with twelve classrooms or more and attached kindergartens, and four complete elementary schools with six grades or more and attached kindergartens will be established in the area with convenient transportation and easier recovery of the market to meet the urgent needs. The first phase can accommodate approximately 3,000 to 4,000 elementary school students to restore the number of students accommodated by the municipal elementary schools before the war. However, after the first year, as local housing construction gradually increases and residents gradually move back, the number of students will inevitably increase. Moreover, some private elementary schools will not be easy to restore. It is still necessary to plan for the gradual return of school-age children and the remedy for the loss of schooling for students in private schools. It is proposed to add four elementary schools with six classrooms or more in the second phase and one municipal middle school, one twelve-grade elementary school, and two six-grade elementary schools in the third phase to achieve universal education. As for the area affected by the war, that is, all places in the Zhabei area except the destroyed area, there were six municipal elementary schools, including Xinmin, Yongxing, Pengnan, Tanzhen, Qimei, and Haishan. These school buildings have not been severely damaged. It is proposed that in the temporary reorganization plan, five elementary schools will be reopened first, but Xinmin Elementary School will be opened at another location. Other private middle and elementary schools will also gradually recover.</p>
<p>Chou. Jiangwan District: The towns and villages in this area have all been damaged. The bureau had established twelve municipal elementary schools such as Qiujiang, with most of the school buildings damaged. These twelve schools have a total of thirty-seven classrooms, accommodating more than 2,000 students. In this temporary recovery plan, the partially destroyed Xijiang, Qiujiang, and the undamaged Zhongshan, Jianke, Qiandang, Luge, and Yanwan seven elementary schools will be repaired and reopened immediately. On the other hand, the parts of the Xijiang, Qiujiang, and Yanwan school buildings that were burned down will be rebuilt according to this reconstruction plan. There are also four elementary schools, Maicun, Taowan, Gaojing, and Dongjiang, and the Yujing Elementary School, which were burned down or damaged and cannot be opened at this time. It is proposed to open two elementary schools with six grades or more and attached kindergartens and four two-classroom elementary schools in the first phase to restore the number of students accommodated before the war. It is also proposed to add one municipal middle school (agricultural science), one elementary school with six classrooms or more and attached kindergartens, and three four-classroom elementary schools in the second phase. It is also proposed to expand the six-classroom elementary school established in the second phase to twelve classrooms and add one elementary school with six classrooms or more and attached kindergartens and two four-classroom elementary schools in the third phase to expand the capacity.</p>
<p>Yin. Wusong District: The towns and villages in this area have all been damaged. The bureau previously established eight schools, including Wusong Elementary School, and one Wusong Junior High School. The elementary schools have a total of thirty classrooms, accommodating approximately 2,000 elementary school students, and the middle school has four classrooms, accommodating more than 100 middle school students. All the schools have been damaged. In this temporary plan, the partially destroyed Wusong, Taixing, and Tancun three elementary schools will be repaired and reopened. On the other hand, the parts of the Wusong Elementary School and other school buildings that have been destroyed will be rebuilt according to the reconstruction plan. There are also five elementary schools, Peiji, Wanbei, Songbei, Chenxiang, and Haoqiao, whose school buildings have been completely or partially destroyed and cannot be opened. It is proposed to expand Wusong Junior High School into a complete middle school specializing in engineering and establish one elementary school with twelve classrooms and an attached kindergarten and four four-classroom elementary schools in the first phase. It is also proposed to establish one elementary school with six classrooms or more and attached kindergartens and two four-classroom elementary schools in the second phase. In the third phase, it is proposed to create a vocational school and add one elementary school with twelve classrooms and an attached kindergarten and two four-classroom elementary schools to achieve universal education.</p>

<p>Liu Changchun, the first athlete from China to attend the World Games, and his coach, Mr. Song Junfu, boarded the President Wilson ship at 11:00 AM yesterday morning amidst enthusiastic farewells and departed Shanghai for the United States. A large crowd from all walks of life gathered at the Customs wharf to see them off, demonstrating their patriotic unity and placing infinite hope in Mr. Liu.</p>
<p>▲ A Solemn and Enthusiastic Flag-Giving Ceremony</p>
<p>The small boat carrying the passengers to the President Wilson ship left the shore at 10:00 AM. Before boarding the small boat, the flag-giving ceremony was held. At 9:30 AM, Wang Zhengting, the chairman of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, presented Liu with a bright national flag and a triangular pennant of the federation on the Customs wharf. Liu received them respectfully. This national flag will be planted at the World Games. Wang then delivered a speech, saying that China has a long history of sports, and Mr. Liu is a famous general of our country. He hopes that he will work hard to win glory for the motherland and live up to his mission. After Liu thanked him, he boarded the small boat holding the flag. At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the sound film production by Fox Company failed due to a broken machine.</p>
<p>▲ Three Cheers for the Republic of China</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting, accompanied by his wife and Zhao Jinqing, a director of the federation, waited at the wharf to bid farewell with great sincerity. There were also about 400 people from all walks of life who came to see them off. The small boat left the wharf at 10:00 AM sharp. Zhou Jiaqi, a staff member of the federation, led the well-wishers to shout "Long live the Republic of China" three times, the sound echoing in the sky, stirring and magnificent. As the small boat went further away, Wang and the others and those who saw him off...</p>
<p>▲ Farewell on the President Wilson Ship</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng and friends of Song and Liu, as well as newspaper reporters, also boarded the small boat to the President Wilson ship. They arrived at the Yangshupu Pier at 10:20 AM to board the ship. The cabins of Mr. Song and Mr. Liu were number 131, which were very comfortable. The small boat returned at 10:45 AM, and the President Wilson also slowly moved. Everyone leaned on the railing and looked out, waving small towels. The figures gradually blurred until they disappeared. The well-wishers returned to Shanghai, while Mr. Song and Mr. Liu left Shanghai for Los Angeles.</p>

<p>(4) The Significance of the Olympic Games</p>
<p>The significance of the Olympic Games is profound and broad. The words of Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France, the initiator of the modern Olympic Games, are cited to express his intentions:</p>
<p>(The restoration of the Olympic Games, in modern life and circumstances, brings together the peoples of the world every four years, trusting that competitions of peace and courtesy can organize the supreme form of internationalism.)</p>
<p>(Above all, it can preserve in athletic sports the noble and heroic qualities that made people stand out in the past, and enjoy the same admirable status in the educational position of the people of this era as the ancient Greek people's education did.)</p>
<p>(Competitive sports are gradually spreading all over the world and have replaced unhealthy entertainment and harmful wandering in young people's lives. People in society must have their various shortcomings. True competitive sports can eliminate their evils to promote a healthy national spirit.)</p>
<p>(It is still difficult to judge to what extent the Olympic concept has progressed, but judging from the various aspects of its creation, the depth of its definition is very clear: (1) create and enhance the friendly relations of peaceful communication between civilized countries; (2) clarify and eliminate the selfish and fraudulent means in competitive sports, seek games that everyone can get a fair judgment, and make the competition not a youth's joy with victory.)</p>
<p>In short, the World Olympic Games has three goals: social education and morality. In the social aspect, it enables people to have a spirit of mutual understanding; in the educational aspect, (1) making physical education an active and rational development (2) establishing public sports fields and sports fields; in the moral aspect, it promotes (1) the spirit that sports should have (2) the movement of the masses. In short, it is to protect and promote pure amateur sports. Dedicated and dedicated people are here.</p>

Then, it was resolved to improve the association's affairs and propose various cases to the National Sports Conference. The contents are recorded as follows: (1) Re-election of officers case. Due to the small number of attendees, it was resolved to postpone the re-election to the general meeting on September 15. Before the new officers are produced, the old officers will still be responsible. (2) Amendment of the constitution case.

(3) Investigation of the association's members case. It was resolved that the secretary should send letters to investigate the current situation of the association's members. (4) National Sports Conference proposal case.

<h3 id="e116">Song Ziwen Agrees with Silver and Money Industries on the <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Principle of Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan</p>
<p>▲ It Can Be Implemented After the Government Decides</p>
<p>▲ From Then On, the Currency System Has Hope of Unification</p>
<p>Before leaving Shanghai and returning to Beijing, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen convened a meeting of leaders from the silver and money industries in this city at the Song residence on the morning of the 7th. In addition to discussing other financial issues, the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan was discussed in detail. The principle has been determined after consultations between Minister Song and the silver and money industries. It is only awaiting the government's decision before research can be conducted on implementation methods.</p>
<p>▲ According to a bank manager, the motive for changing to yuan is that the lack of unification of China's monetary system has long been a major problem for the social economy. The proposal for reform has been advocated for a long time. When Japan implemented the gold embargo and India changed to the gold standard, Minister Song Ziwen also had a motion that China should also implement the gold standard and asked the foreign advisor of the Ministry of Finance, Kailmuer, to study China's old monetary system and write a reform opinion book for implementation. However, due to Chinese customs, in addition to taels, there is also a kind of standard silver system. The reform process is complex and cannot be done urgently, so the motion was shelved. As for the motive for abolishing taels and changing to yuan this time, on the one hand, it is due to the over-complexity of the existing currency system, and on the other hand, it is due to the sharp drop in foreign cents, which is a good opportunity to change taels to yuan. Therefore, the government and merchants have this feeling and resolutely have this proposal to abolish taels and change to yuan.</p>
<p>▲ The Principle Has Been Determined. When Minister Song Ziwen convened a meeting of representatives of the silver and money industries the other day (the 7th) to discuss the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, because the government and the business community both have the determination to reform, the discussion was very smooth. At the end of the discussion, it was completely determined. The main points are as follows: (1) Implement the abolition of silver tael calculation and completely adopt the silver yuan system to unify the currency system. (2) When completely adopting the silver yuan system, the old cast silver yuan will still be used as before. (3) Once the legal price and weight, the standard of each yuan being seven qian and one fen or seven qian and two fen is stipulated, the casting of new coins will begin. As for the silver tael system, when the implementation of the abolition, all past transactions calculated in silver taels must be discussed in detail and decided after the government decides.</p>
<p>▲ The silver and money industries agree. When discussing the method of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, the silver and money industries have long felt the pain of the lack of unification of the currency system. If the silver tael can be abolished and the silver yuan system can be adopted exclusively, there will be no more complicated procedures of silver tael cutting and exchange, and the intangible losses of sudden rises and falls. It will be of great benefit to financial transactions thereafter. Therefore, the four banks of China, Jiaotong, Central, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Shanghai Bank Preparation Depot, and representatives of the money industry at that time all unanimously expressed their approval of this new opportunity to change taels to yuan and unify the currency system.</p>
<p>▲ Implementation is probably not far away. The principle has been determined. It is only necessary to wait for Minister Song to return to Beijing to discuss with the government again, submit it to the central official meeting for decision, and then discuss the detailed clauses and start implementation. According to the observation trend of this person (a bank manager claimed himself), now that the government and the business community both feel the convenience of unification and are determined to implement the abolition of taels and change to yuan at the extremely good opportunity of the sharp drop in foreign cents, the period of implementation should not be far away after some preparation. The estimated date is about two months, or it may be realized.</p>
<p>▲ Casting New Coins in Shanghai. When this method is implemented and the legal price of the new coins is determined, the Ministry of Finance must cast new coins for use. The mint in Beijing has been destroyed, and the one in Hangzhou has also stopped casting. Therefore, when casting new coins in the future, it will be cast by the Shanghai Mint. It is said that Mr. Xu Jiqing, the director of the Shanghai Mint, was retained by the Ministry of Finance when he submitted his resignation for the first time after being appointed by the central government, and the second resignation has not been approved until now. If this matter is implemented, the factory will of course have to be opened for casting, so the Ministry of Finance is still interested in Mr. Xu to take office.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Exchange Relations. After the implementation of the abolition of taels and changing to yuan, there are still considerable relations in foreign exchange. Because when using taels, the exchange rate is based on the exchange rate between the British shilling and the silver tael. After changing to yuan, there is a considerable relationship between the fineness of the raw silver used for casting silver yuan and the legal price of silver yuan. Therefore, the exchange rate of silver yuan in foreign exchange should not be as high or low as when using taels.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Standards for <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Rent Reduction in This City</p>
<p>▲ Announced by the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Rent Reduction Measures. The Municipal Council issued a proclamation yesterday, stating that since the January 28th Incident, the war has caused great damage in various places. Even the adjacent areas have not been able to live in peace. Therefore, people from all walks of life believe that if rent is not reduced appropriately, it will not be enough to provide relief. However, landlords and residents have different positions and different opinions. Disputes have arisen from holding each other. If it is delayed indefinitely, not only will the parties be at a disadvantage, but the local order and social security will be greatly affected. Renting a house is originally a contractual relationship and belongs to the judicial scope. Now, according to the submissions of both parties, there is no objection to the principle of rent exemption, but the standards for rent exemption are requested to be determined together. The mayor has considered the situation, extensively adopted public opinion, and formulated four measures and prepared illustrations, which were submitted to the Municipal Council for decision and announcement to serve as a guideline. All landlords must know that the use and benefit of leased items is a prerequisite for the payment of rent. There is a clear provision in the law, and it should be understood in particular. All residents must also know that the burden of this disaster should not be entirely placed on the industry of real estate ownership. Moreover, the situation of real estate ownership in this city is complicated. The economic capacity of the landlords may not be as the residents say. It is hoped that landlords and residents will embrace the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual assistance to achieve the goal of co-existence and co-prosperity. The future of the country, society, and the municipality depends on it. This proclamation lists the standards and methods as follows: (1) Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinhang, Zhenru, Pengpu, Yinxiang, Zhabei, and other districts (including the section of the North District that crosses the boundary and builds roads) are exempt from rent for three months. (2) The special zone north of the Suzhou River and west of Yokohama is exempt from rent for two and a half months. (3) The special zone east of Yokohama and the Yangshupu area are exempt from rent for two months. (4) The South Shanghai District and the part of the Pusong District north of the Suzhou River are exempt from rent for one month.</p>
<p>▲ Property Tax Exemption for One Month. The municipal government believes that the residents in the war zone have suffered huge losses. In order to sympathize with the people's difficulties, it has stipulated measures to reduce and exempt various taxes in the war zone and announced them to the public. However, the scope of implementation stipulated therein is limited to the war zone and its adjacent areas. It is now heard that the municipal government believes that although the South Shanghai District and the part of the Pusong District north of the Suzhou River have not directly suffered losses in the war, they have been indirectly affected during the war period because residents have not been able to live in peace. Now that the rent in the area has been exempted for one month after the Municipal Council's resolution, the property tax will also be reduced appropriately. At the same time, it was decided by the Municipal Council to exempt the tax for one month. It is said that it will be announced to the public soon and the Finance Bureau will be ordered to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Lin Baike Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲ Detailed Conversation with Our Newspaper's Reporter</p>
<p>▲ Calls Sun Yat-sen the Second Christ</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Baike, legal advisor to the National Government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the "GeMetsinger" steamer with General Mei Renjie. He is a close friend of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, stout, balding, with many missing teeth. Dressed in white canvas clothing, he came to our office for a detailed conversation with our reporter immediately after unloading his luggage. Mr. Lin spoke frankly and had a particularly naive and endearing demeanor. What follows is the content of his conversation:</p>
<p>I (referring to Lin Baike himself; the same applies hereafter) was dispatched to the United States in October 1930 as a special envoy of the National Government, where I repeatedly engaged with U.S. President Hoover and leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives to discuss the progress of silver loans. If China had not experienced further civil wars, the silver loan of 27 million taels would have been secured long ago. I had suggested two types of loans to the National Government: a silver loan and a wheat loan. The silver loan was designated for the construction of national roads, while the wheat loan was for disaster relief. American politicians are divided into two factions: one advocates exporting silver due to America's surplus silver reserves, and the other advocates exporting wheat due to America's overabundance of wheat. I took advantage of this opportunity to navigate between these two factions, and as a result, the wheat loan was successfully obtained, amounting to approximately 30 million dan of American wheat. If China had not had internal strife, the silver loan would also have been successful. In 1931, I traveled to Europe, visiting 31 locations to promote China. I firmly believe that if the Chinese government and people can unite sincerely, then the violent Japanese will be nothing to fear. If China can truly achieve unification, then there is still hope for the future, and the silver loan will not be a problem. In April of this year, while in Madrid, Spain, I received an urgent telegram from the National Government summoning me back. Therefore, I had to temporarily end my promotional work and return home with haste. After arriving in Shanghai today, I learned that my old friend Mr. Zhan Tang is in Hong Kong, and Mr. Zhesheng has also left. However, Mr. Jingwei is in Nanjing. I plan to stay in Shanghai for a short time, both to await instructions from the government and to expedite the creation of a work report. It is easier to obtain information and collect statistical materials in Shanghai for the report. Alas, I am old. I have followed Mr. Sun for 25 years. Whenever there were difficulties, Mr. Sun would resolve them with a few words. I firmly believe that if Mr. Sun were still alive, my work would proceed more smoothly. Now, however, the party lacks a leader, and the organization is disorganized. Although I am filled with enthusiasm, there is nothing I can do. I hope the people will offer well-intentioned criticism and supervision to the government, and that the government and the people will cooperate sincerely, so that there will be hope for China's future.</p>

<p>In his conversation with the reporter, Lin Baike repeatedly referred to Sun Yat-sen as his second Christ and presented the reporter with a copy of his recent book, "Gospel of Sun Chung Shan" ("The Mission of Sun Yat-sen"). This is noted here to express our gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Silk Factory Labor Strike <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Resolved Yesterday Through Mediation</p>
<p>▲ Work Resumes for All Tomorrow</p>
<p>Following the labor strike at silk factories in the city, party and government authorities formally mediated yesterday, and a mediation record has been signed. Workers will resume work across the board tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Mediation Conference: Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened the Labor-Management Mediation Committee to formally mediate the silk factory strike. Present were employer representatives Zhu Jing'an and Zhang Peichuo, labor representatives Zhu Xizhang and Yang Gengdi, Wang Guoxian of the Public Security Bureau, Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wang Xianqing of the Bureau of Social Affairs. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xianqing, with Wang Rangyu recording. The chairman first reported, and the employer representatives stated that the silk factories operating were completely acting on behalf of the silver and money trades, and that in reality, the factories and workers were in the same position. At the time, the silver and money trades had contract stipulations, setting the price at one tael and one mace and a half per cart for a period of three months. If the workers were to demand an increase in wages, the contracts would inevitably be terminated. The labor representatives stated that since the wage reduction, the workers' daily income was insufficient to cover expenses, and they requested that the factories consider an increase in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible, which would be fortunate for both labor and management. The chairman stated that he understood the workers' hardships and that he was also aware of the factory's difficulties. However, no matter how difficult the factory was, they were asked to take responsibility for a slight increase so that work could resume as soon as possible. It was not until 8 PM that labor and management reached an agreement and signed the mediation record.</p>
<p>▲ Original Text of the Record: Labor-Management Mediation Committee of Shanghai Municipality, Mediation Record. Disputing Parties: Labor: Industrial Union of Silk Reeling Industry, Districts 3, 4, and 6 of Shanghai Municipality, represented by Zhu Xizhang and Yang Gengdi; Management: Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association, represented by Zhu Jing'an and Zhang Peisi. Regarding the wage dispute of the disputing parties listed on the right, the committee convened mediation, and the agreement signed by both parties is recorded as follows: 1. Due to the decline of the silk industry, employers have suffered greatly. Paying the original wages is difficult. In the spirit of labor-management cooperation, the top-grade female workers' wages will be temporarily reduced to 45 cents per person per day. The wages of other workers will be determined proportionally. 2. The female workers' applications for work and holiday bonuses will be temporarily suspended. 3. Working hours will remain the same and will not be extended. 4. Employees' salaries will be calculated monthly according to the original terms and conditions. 5. Silkworm cocoon applications will remain as they are. 6. Employers agree to resume work on the 10th of this month, and workers must return to work as usual. 7. These conditions will be effective from the date of signing until December of this year. This agreement has been reached with the consent and signatures of both parties and should be regarded as a labor agreement between the disputing parties. Chairman: Wang Xianqing; Committee Members: Yang Gengdi, Zhu Xizhang, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peisi, Zhou Lianze, Wang Guoxian; Observers: Tang Binggan, Fei Danru, Wu Suzhen, Liu Sanbao, 娻巧珍, Yan Aizhu, Yang Shumei, Xia Linzhi, Cui Abao, Yuan Yunlong, Le Xiaorong, Gu Xiaomei, Chen Laohai, Chen Jilin. July 8th, 21st Year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>▲ Association Meeting: The four representatives of the silk factories, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peisi, Tang Bingqian, and Fei Fengtai, immediately went to the Trade Association after leaving the Bureau of Social Affairs to report everything. More than fifty silk factory representatives attended, and Zhu Jing'an was again elected as the temporary chairman. He reported on the proceedings of the mediation meeting attended at the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating in brief: "Today, the mediation meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs was attended by members from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. After the representatives took their seats, I, the undersigned, first questioned the representatives of the labor union about the silk factory strike news published in the local news sections of the 'News,' 'Current Affairs,' and other newspapers today (yesterday). It stated that the labor union had made comments to the 'New Voice Society' reporter, saying that silk factories could still make a profit of over 69 taels per day. I asked from where this expenditure was calculated. Currently, the contract prices of each factory are between one tael and five mace to one tael and one qian. According to the wage of four jiao and two fen, this is not enough to cover expenses. This is because these old cocoons were mortgaged to the silver and money trades by the factory. Now, without the funds to redeem them, we must代成絲 [unable to ascertain meaning], wait for the opportunity to sell them, and fulfill our obligations. Today, after reading the newspaper, the financial community has questioned the factory, accusing it of wanting to profit during this extremely serious period, and expressing great indignation. May I ask if the labor union will take responsibility for this inaccurate report?" The labor union representative denied making this statement and promised to send a letter to each newspaper to correct it. (Note: this newspaper did not publish this statement). Then, the Bureau of Social Affairs mediated. The chairman, Wang Bing, sincerely mediated between labor and management, repeatedly advising each representative, and it was not until 5:30 PM that an agreement was reached. The mediation resulted in a total of six articles. (1) (the above is omitted)." Chairman Zhu stated, "This labor strike coincided with Chairman Shen's trip to Hangzhou. With the entrustment of our colleagues, although the matter has been resolved, I feel deeply indebted during this time of great difficulty for our colleagues, as we still want to increase the burden. I hope everyone will understand." At this point, a representative from a certain factory stood up and said, "This labor strike was handled by Chairman Zhu and the seven representatives including Mr. Zhang Peisi, who traveled back and forth and held meetings with the labor union representatives for days. They were exceptionally tired. Now that the matter has been resolved, our colleagues should express our gratitude." At this point, all the representatives stood up to express their gratitude, and then the bell was rung to adjourn the meeting. It was already 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Instruction: The Municipal Government yesterday issued an instruction to the Public Security Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs regarding the silk factory strike in the city, stating, "For the purpose of ordering, this office has investigated the case of the silk factory strike in the city. The Silk Factory Trade Association's committee had previously submitted a request for protection to the government, and the government ordered the bureau to work with the Bureau of Social Affairs to handle the matter diligently. Now, according to a confidential report, the relationship between labor and management in the industry was originally harmonious. The disputes were instigated by unscrupulous individuals, and the workers who understood the situation have been automatically returning to work for days but have been prevented from gathering and threatened. They are determined to destroy what little is left of our country's silk industry." Based on this, the production of silk is one of our country's major industries. In recent years, sales have stagnated, and it is declining daily. Both labor and management in the industry should sincerely cooperate and work together to save it. Even members of society agree that the only silk industry left in our country cannot withstand further destruction. However, these unscrupulous elements have other motives, instigating strikes and engaging in destruction, which is deplorable. In addition to ordering the Bureau of Social Affairs to quickly investigate the facts of the labor-management dispute and handle it impartially, this office urgently orders the bureau to comply and immediately and closely investigate and arrest the individuals instigating the labor strike, protect the workers' return to work, and report the handling situation without delay. This order. (The text of the order to the Bureau of Social Affairs is omitted.)</p>

<p>Labor Strike at French Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>▲ No Results</p>
<p>Following the strike by all staff and workers of the Mechanical Affairs Department of the French Water and Electricity Company, party and government authorities attempted mediation yesterday but were unable to find a solution. The municipal government sent a special envoy to consult with the French consul, and all workers held a general meeting, further escalating the situation. The company is protected by French soldiers. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Strike Situation Yesterday: Staff and workers in all departments of the Mechanical Affairs Department continued their strike yesterday and reported to the Strike Committee. They gathered at the Water and Electricity Industry Union in the Second District of the Dada Lane on Luban Road.

The iron gates of the company at the Luban Road entrance were tightly closed, and Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed around to protect the company.

<p>▲ Party and Government Officials Sent to Mediate: Zhu Guilin of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Zhong Quan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhou Lianze were ordered to meet at 11:15 AM yesterday with Zhang Fubao, director of the Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union, and Shen Jingyi, the workers' representative, to attempt mediation at the company. The comprador Xu Jingshan notified the manager Gu Qiya, who refused to meet with the union and worker representatives. After strenuous efforts proved ineffective, the party and government officials met with the manager and explained the reason for their mediation. The manager stated that the company was a French company located in the French concession, and that the workers' demands had been submitted to the French consul and board of directors for handling, so a response could not be given at this time. However, point four, the subsidy fee, had already been approved to be paid to the workers. If the workers were willing to resume work unconditionally, they could go directly to work, and he hoped they would be persuaded to resume work. The party and government officials repeatedly explained to no avail, and they withdrew at 12:20 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Warning to Working Staff: After the staff and workers of the Mechanical Affairs Department went on strike, the office, ordering department, and comprador department, totaling 45 staff members, continued to work as usual yesterday. The Strike Committee issued a special warning yesterday, stating, "Since the strike, the majority of workers and staff have come to the committee. However, a small number of staff members have tried to ingratiate themselves with the 方 [unclear] and undermine the labor movement, continuing to work as usual. The general meeting has resolved to warn these staff members to leave the factory and come to the committee immediately, or they will be dealt with according to the method for dealing with running dogs. This is hereby announced for your information."</p>
<p>▲ General Meeting in the Afternoon: At 3 PM yesterday, the Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union held a general meeting of all members at the intersection of Luban Road and Dada Lane. Zhong Quan of the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhu Guilin of the Bureau of Social Affairs attended to provide guidance. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched armed police to provide protection. More than 800 members attended. Shen Jingyi was publicly elected as chairman and reported on the strike. Then, discussions began. (1) The case of Xu Amei, the former executive director of the union, was resolved as follows: A. Request the company to prove that Xu Amei is not a communist. B. Have all the workers send a letter to the court to prove it. C. Wages will be paid during his time in prison. D. Reinstate his job after his release. E. 求訓 [Seek training] from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs to provide assistance. F. Issue a declaration that he was falsely imprisoned. (2) The case of Zhu Along and 21 others in the wiring department was resolved as follows: A. Demand immediate reinstatement. B. Wages will be paid for the period of the work stoppage.

(12) Those who work every month without taking leave will be eligible to apply for four工 [unclear]. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Conducting Consultations: The manager of the French Water and Electricity Company claimed that the workers' demands had been submitted to the French consul and board of directors for handling, which caused obstacles to the mediation efforts of the party and government officials yesterday. It is reported that the Municipal Government, in order to resolve the French electricity strike as soon as possible, will send officials to consult with the French consul to find a solution and avoid the expansion of the labor strike.</p>
<p>▲ French Soldiers Protect the Company: According to sources at the company, the case of Shao Ziying is not considered a dismissal but a termination. The reason is that the position of meter reading supervisor is no longer needed. However, the workers believe that the company's business has been booming for years, so there is no reason to eliminate the position. Also, after the general meeting of all workers yesterday, the company suddenly increased the number of armed French Annamite soldiers by four teams, about 100 men, led by French officers, who entered the company in the evening to guard and protect it.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Trade Association <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate Inferior Silk</p>
<p>▲ Aimed at Promoting Domestic Products</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association recently heard rumors among its members that they were purchasing inferior silk cocoons. This not only concerns the reputation of all silk weaving factories but will also destroy the fate of domestic goods. Therefore, it convened a special emergency meeting yesterday. Many well-known silk weaving manufacturers in Shanghai attended. The important resolutions are as follows: (1) Send a letter to the Jianghai Customs to investigate whether Japanese silk cocoons have been imported in recent months. (2) Dispatch investigating committee members Wang Shiqiang, Wang Baotai, Tong Xinbo, and Qian Boxi to secretly visit various factories to thoroughly investigate the raw materials of the textiles. (3) Publish announcements in the Shen, Xin, and Min newspapers, offering a reward. If anyone finds that members of the trade association are privately purchasing inferior silk cocoons and obtains evidence, they will be sent to this association and will be rewarded with 500 yuan. The rest is omitted. The letter to the Jianghai Customs states, "We are writing to you to say that promoting domestic products is the inherent responsibility of citizens. Silk is the earliest invention in our country and has a long history. It occupies an important position among export goods. However, in recent years, without knowing how to study it, it has plummeted. Thinking of this, we are deeply saddened. This association is a silk weaving organization in Shanghai, and we should do our utmost to promote domestic silk in order to reverse the loss of rights and interests and avoid being ridiculed by foreigners. Recently, we heard that a large batch of Japanese silk cocoons has been imported into this city, causing unscrupulous merchants to act against their conscience and secretly use them. The impact is huge, hindering both the national economy and people's livelihoods. We do not know if this rumor is based on facts. This office is the general hub of taxation, and we must be able to clearly indicate whether Japanese silk cocoons have come to Shanghai. Can you please provide detailed information on whether there have been any imports each month since March of this year until today, and copy down the monthly import quantities one by one? This concerns the public interest, and we hope for your sympathy. We are sending this letter accordingly and ask you to investigate. The reward announcement says, "Recently, there have been rumors outside that some people in the silk weaving industry are purchasing inferior silk cocoons, and the newspapers have even printed it, which seems to be accurate. This is deeply disturbing. Do members of this association's silk weaving factories actually purchase and use inferior silk cocoons? This has a great impact on the reputation of our colleagues. If we do not investigate immediately, it will be difficult to distinguish right from wrong. In addition to secretly dispatching special personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, this association is offering a reward of 500 yuan. If anyone finds that members of the trade association are privately purchasing inferior silk cocoons and obtains solid evidence that can be used as proof, they will be sent to this association and will be given the reward of 500 yuan. The funds have been deposited and await fulfillment. We will not go back on our word. Otherwise, malicious people will spread rumors, not only damaging the reputation of our industry but also destroying the fate of domestic goods. This concerns the development of industry and commerce, and is obviously malicious. Once this association has verified it, we will strictly investigate these rumor-mongers according to law to deter others from following suit. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Investigating Group's Attitude Towards <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Written Statements</p>
<p>According to a certain important Chinese representative who recently returned from the North, the representative office submitted more than 20 written statements to the investigating group, explaining in detail the events of the September 18th Incident and the brutality of the Japanese army. They also exposed the Japanese policy of aggression against us over the past decades, as well as all kinds of actions that violated international law and international treaties and violated or exceeded the Sino-Japanese treaties. In addition, the background of the 21 Demands and parallel lines issues was also explained in detail. Regarding the 21 Demands, particular attention was paid to the forced signing and the points denied by the parliament, explaining our country's position. Regarding the parallel lines issue, during the Sino-Chinese representatives' conference on the Eastern Three Provinces Treaty in the 31st year of Guangxu, it was not recorded in the treaty, and it must not be regarded as an obligation under the treaty. These and other reasons were repeatedly stated. At the same time, the Japanese side also submitted various written statements, attacking our country with all their might. In particular, they arbitrarily accused us of violating treaties and failing to fulfill treaty obligations. After receiving the written statements from both sides, the investigation group stated that they were still studying them and did not express any opinions. However, it is reported that they were quite dissatisfied with the Japanese side's various acts of aggression that disregarded public law and treaties, and advocated that the dignity of the treaty must be maintained. However, they also found it strange that our country denied the 21 Demands treaty. Furthermore, the Japanese side used Manchukuo as a puppet and actively proceeded with the annexation of the Northeast, disregarding all public and international laws. All past cases in the Eastern Provinces and all vested rights were entrusted to the puppet state, which was deemed to have been resolved. There was no need to negotiate with our side based on the Sino-Japanese treaty. Therefore, the Japanese felt that there was no need to study the legal effect of the 21 Demands treaty. The Japanese side's attitude was so tough that the investigation group found it very difficult, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e124">There is also Talk of Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that, according to reliable sources in this port, the National Government has decided to hold direct Sino-Japanese negotiations to resolve the Manchurian issue. However, these negotiations will be held in a country会议 [meeting] , and all countries related to the Far East will be invited to participate. It is claimed that the discussions at the meeting must be based on the Nine-Power Treaty of the Washington Conference. However, there is now an indication that China may agree to the five basic principles proposed by Japan at the League of Nations General Assembly last October. These five basic principles are those that the Japanese claim must be used as the basis for the Manchurian negotiations: (1) China and Japan mutually guarantee not to intensify the situation and to protect each other's territorial integrity. (2) All anti-Japanese activities in China, including boycotting Japanese goods, should be permanently stopped. (3) Give guarantees for the safety of life and property of Japanese residents in China. (4) Railways built in Manchuria will be paid for with Japanese funds, and existing agreements on railway construction in Manchuria will be recognized. (5) Recognize existing treaty rights, including Japanese residents' commercial lease rights in Manchuria. It is reported that the National Government has decided to hold direct negotiations because domestic scholars have been commenting on its improper reliance on the League of Nations. All the basic principles guiding the direct negotiations have been agreed upon after being proposed by Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is also said that the overall plan for direct negotiations was drafted by Wang Jingwei and then submitted for discussion at the Lushan Conference.</p>

<p>▲ Recreation Assembly Held at Eight Immortals Bridge</p>
<p>The National Salvation Joint Association of various groups in Xiaoximen and Zhonghua Road in this city held the fourth day of National Salvation Propaganda Week yesterday (the 8th). The venue was the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. The meeting was rung open at 2:00 PM that day. Although the wind and rain were heavy, the guests continued to arrive one after another, not diminished by the weather. It shows that everyone is determined and wants to save this critically endangered nation. The chairman was Wang Hanliang, the recorder was Jiang Daiqing, the general affairs director was Chen Ya'fu, the recreation director was Chen Peide, the speech director was Zhang Tianbai, the executive director was Song An, the chief inspector was Yuan Zhaoxin, the front stage director was Yu Zhenhui, the backstage director was Xu Gongmei, and the master of ceremonies was Zhang Yichen. The chairman delivered the opening speech, roughly saying that the current foreign insults are indeed becoming more and more sinister. The tragic case of January 28th has now come to an end, but we must not forget it, and we must not just live in a drunken stupor. We must know that the current Northeast Three Provinces are about to become territories that do not belong to our country. Only the Volunteer Army and General Ma Zhanshan are struggling there, but the disparity between the two sides is too great. If there is no substantial assistance, their outcome will hardly be optimistic and will hardly avoid failure. Therefore, I hope that everyone will quickly rescue them within the scope of their capabilities. It is not just saving them; in other words, it is saving ourselves. At the same time, we must urge the government to wake up and ask the government not to continue to adhere to the policy of non-resistance. Otherwise, I am afraid that it will not only be the Northeast Three Provinces that will eventually perish, but the destruction of the entire China may also be just around the corner. Then, Chen Peide, Cao Zhigong, Chuan Qinghuai, Hu Shouqi, and others gave speeches one after another. Their words were all alarming and moving, mainly urging compatriots to earnestly save the country, not just engage in empty talk, and to promote domestic goods as the fundamental issue of saving the country. They must be determined to save the country from its perilous situation, etc. Applause rang out from time to time. Next, there was a recreation performance (the speeches are omitted). Today's recreation will be held at Zhenxiu Elementary School in Yangjiadu, Pudong.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The French Concession Police Have Prosecuted the Russian Beggar Case <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Special Court No. 2 Held a Hearing Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>In the case of the death of Russian beggar Georgie Ladigaiff due to illness, the French Concession Police Department, based on the report of Simon Glandigoff, who claimed to be the deceased's brother, believed that the courthouse detention center was indeed negligent and committed an act of injury causing death. Therefore, they have been conducting investigations in recent days, sparing no effort. It was originally scheduled to formally prosecute the case to the court a few days ago and, knowing that they had no right to review, they voluntarily abandoned the request for review. However, the police officially filed the lawsuit with the court only on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. After receiving the complaint, the court immediately conducted a public hearing by Judge Wang Gangxu of the Second Criminal Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. The President of the Special Court No. 2, Ying Shi, also personally went to the court to listen to the hearing, considering the importance of the case. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for the Police Prosecution: The case was scheduled to be heard yesterday morning, but due to the congestion of cases in the morning, it was changed to 2:30 PM yesterday. The police are prosecuting a total of three people: (1) Xu Chongwen, the warden of the detention center, (2) Yu Minggao, the forensic doctor, and (3) Zhou Zongxiang, the guard of the detention center. The warden of the detention center, Xu Chongwen, and the forensic doctor, Yu Minggao, are being prosecuted for negligence under the second paragraph of Article 310 of the Criminal Code. Another defendant, Zhou Zongxiang, the guard of the detention center, is being prosecuted for injury under Article 295 of the Criminal Code. During the court hearing, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stood up and stated the reasons for the prosecution, requesting that this case involve a person who was arrested by the police on June 16, sent to the court on the 17th, and died on the 19th. His name was Georgie Ladigaiff, also known as Georgie Glandigoff. Now, his brother, Simon Glandigoff, reported to the police administrative agency that his brother was beaten to death by the guard in the detention center. After receiving the report, the police immediately began to investigate and prosecuted the three defendants based on the above conditions. However, the police have not yet notified the plaintiff and witnesses in this case because they did not know in advance that the court had scheduled a trial.</p>
<p>▲ Warden's Testimony: After the police lawyer finished his statement, Judge Wang began to ask the first defendant, Xu Chongwen, the warden of the detention center, about his age and origin, and his reasons for defense. After Xu stated his age and origin, he said that he had three reasons to declare to the court: (1) According to the police delivery form and the court's deposit slip, it was noted that the deceased Russian criminal was named Georgie Ladigaiff. Now, the police suddenly has another name, Georgie Glandigoff. The judge should determine whether the above two names refer to the same person. (2) The delivery form at the time stated that the criminal had no home, no occupation, and no residence. Now, someone claiming to be his brother has come forward to sue. Whether this person is the deceased's brother. (3) The police accused the cause of death as being beaten to death and also as being negligent. In law, the two crimes cannot be prosecuted at the same time. Therefore, it should be determined how the deceased died. The deceased was already ill before entering the detention center. When he was sent to the court for trial, he could not stand in court. This was witnessed by the judge and the police lawyer at the time. When he was sent to the detention center at 4:00 PM on June 17, I immediately asked forensic doctor Yu for a diagnosis because he was ill. Forensic doctor Yu arrived at the detention center at about 5:00 PM, and after the diagnosis, he gave him a relieving drink. The next morning, the condition improved slightly. Forensic doctor Yu came to the detention center again at 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM for diagnosis and treatment. Because the condition had improved slightly, he did not advocate sending him to the hospital. According to Article 50 of the prison regulations, the person in charge of the prison is not required to send sick prisoners to the hospital. Moreover, the patient had received a diagnosis from a forensic doctor and had improved slightly, so he did not advocate transferring him to the hospital at that time. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 19th, according to the guard's report, the patient's condition suddenly became serious. I immediately ordered someone to ask forensic doctor Yu for diagnosis again. At that time, forensic doctor Yu believed that the patient had cholera, and the condition was very serious and should be sent to the hospital. He then ordered the guard to prepare the transfer procedures. Unexpectedly, before the procedures were completed, the patient died at 11:40 AM. The deceased died of cholera. There are many symptoms of cholera, some infectious and some non-infectious. The deceased was said to have non-infectious cholera, so the three Russian criminals in the same prison at the same time were not infected. This is the process of the deceased's admission to the hospital and death.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony of Forensic Doctor Yu: After the first defendant, Xu Chongwen, the warden of the detention center, finished his testimony, the court immediately interrogated the second defendant, forensic doctor Yu Minggao. Yu testified that he was a Chinese medicine practitioner. The deceased Russian criminal was imprisoned in the detention center on June 17 after being sentenced. Because he was ill, he went to the detention center at about 5:00 PM that afternoon for diagnosis and treatment. He found that the patient was suffering from heatstroke and gave him a relieving drink. He went to the detention center for a follow-up examination the next morning. Because the patient was sleeping soundly, the jailer reported that the condition had improved slightly. He gave the jailer some "ping'an san" powder and ordered him to give it to the patient when he woke up. He went to the detention center for diagnosis and treatment again in the afternoon, but the condition did not change. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 AM on the 19th, someone suddenly reported that the condition had suddenly changed. It happened to be raining that day, but when he went to the detention center for diagnosis and treatment as usual, he found that the patient was vomiting, diarrhea, and sweating. According to (omitted), those with vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive sweating were very dangerous and could not be saved. He ordered him to be sent to the hospital for treatment, but he heard that he died before he could be sent to the hospital. After the testimony was completed, the court asked whether the clinic only had "ping'an san" powder and "relieving water" as medicines, or whether there were other methods of treatment besides these two medicines. Yu (forensic doctor) said that the treatment in the clinic was all determined by the diagnosis and medicine was given according to the illness, and there were no regulations.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony of Guard Zhou: After forensic doctor Yu finished his testimony, the court immediately summoned the third defendant, guard Zhou Zongxiang. According to Zhou, he has been a guard for nine months and is in charge of prison cells No. 1 to No. 7. No. 4 is where the deceased Georgie Ladigaiff was detained. Before that, the prison only held one Russian. On June 17, at about 4:00 PM, three more Russians were detained. Before the three Russians entered the prison, one of them could not walk and was supported by two Russians. Later, the one who could not walk was Georgie Ladigaiff. Because he was ill at the time, he was placed in a ward. After the ward was arranged, forensic doctor Yu was invited to the prison for treatment. After the forensic doctor Yu diagnosed and treated him, he ordered him to drink the relieving water. The patient did not have dinner that night. On the 18th, the condition improved slightly. He had a small amount of breakfast. Forensic doctor Yu came to the prison for diagnosis and treatment once in the morning and once in the afternoon and gave him happy water powder to drink. On the morning of the 19th, the condition suddenly changed. He was vomiting and diarrhea, and the condition was very serious. He urgently reported to Warden Xu and asked forensic doctor Yu to diagnose and treat him again. Forensic doctor Yu said that the condition was extremely dangerous and ordered him to be sent to the hospital. Unexpectedly, before he could be sent to the hospital, he died at 11:40 AM. This is the fact of the deceased's passing. I did not have any beating incidents at first. After Zhou's testimony, the court asked whether the deceased had any injuries on his body when he was detained. Zhou testified that the deceased's (omitted) did not have any injuries, but he did not examine his body and did not know. The court ordered Zhou to provide a guarantor.</p>
<p>▲ Reschedule Trial: After Zhou Zongxiang finished his testimony, it was already 4:00 PM. At this time, Pu Laimai, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Simon Glandigoff, had rushed to the court at 3:15 PM after hearing the news and was sitting silently in a corner. He was very calm. However, before the adjournment, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stood up again and stated that the reason for the police prosecution was that the charges of injury and negligence were brought at the same time because the corpse had not yet been re-examined and it was impossible to determine. Therefore, the cause of death or the disease that caused the death should be examined during the re-examination. At that time, the police lawyer submitted the (omitted) of the deceased (omitted). The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to 9:00 AM on July 11 and ordered the plaintiff and witnesses to be summoned to court for questioning next time. The date of the re-examination has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>▲ Re-examination Next Monday: The court now believes that since the case has been formally prosecuted by the police, the judge in charge will schedule a re-examination. The date of the re-examination has not yet been determined. However, the court hopes to move the corpse of the deceased to Shanghai for re-examination next Monday morning so that the truth of the case can be revealed as soon as possible. The forensic doctor for the re-examination should have been arranged by the prosecutor's office of the Special Court. Now, in order to avoid suspicion, the Special Court No. 2 has decided to hire another well-known forensic doctor to take charge or have the prosecutor's office of the High Court No. 3 send someone to inspect it to ensure impartiality.</p>

<p>▲ Serious Negotiations by the Takeover Committee Resulted in:</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Side Has Agreed to Submit the Population Census Themselves</p>
<p>A few days ago, police officers from the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau went to various districts to conduct a population census. However, Japanese residents in Yuching Lane on Doule'an Road and Yongan Lane on North Sichuan Road refused to cooperate with the census and were unwilling to be subject to the control of our country's police authorities. At that time, our police officers stopped the census to avoid misunderstandings and reported it to the Fifth District, which was forwarded to the General Bureau. The Public Security Bureau requested the Takeover Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side. Yin Rugeng, director of the Takeover Committee, sent special envoy Liang Fuchu to negotiate seriously with the Japanese authorities. As a result, the Japanese side agreed to copy the population residing in Zhabei themselves without the need for the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Liang then returned to report to the Takeover Committee, which has issued a document to the Public Security Bureau notifying them yesterday. According to the New Voice Agency reporter, the Japanese residents in Zhabei are being investigated by Mr. Tokunaga, the acting chairman of the Japanese Road Association. It can be completed soon. At present, there are more than 100 households in each of the first and second sub-districts of the Fifth District of the Japanese residents in Zhabei, and there are also dozens of households in the fourth and fifth districts.</p>

<h3 id="e133">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Carry Domestic Mail</p>
<p>▲ Contract Signed with the Post Office</p>
<p>▲ Recovering Extraterritorial Rights and Interests</p>
<p>▲ Designated Areas for Hankou, Guangdong, Tianjin, Ningbo, and Wenzhou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has been sending mail to various parts of the country every day. Wherever there is navigation, it has always been carried by foreign ships for a long time. In recent years, extraterritorial rights and interests have been leaking, resulting in huge losses. Now, General Manager Li of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has signed a contract with the post office to carry mail on behalf of domestic courts, which will be implemented from this month, recovering the right of foreign ships to carry packages. The contract was signed yesterday, and the details of this matter are recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Signing the Contract: The post office has contracts with foreign ships to carry mail, which has always been carried by Taikoo, Jardine, and other ships to various ports in the country. Now, because some of the contracts have expired at the end of June, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as a state-owned shipping company, is under the same Ministry of Communications as the postal service. Therefore, the new General Manager Li Guojie contacted Mr. Zha Peilin, the Shanghai Postmaster, to discuss the matter of carrying mail. After multiple discussions, both parties believed it was feasible and drafted a contract of 19 articles for carrying mail. After the two parties decided, they have signed it, and the guarantor is Li Jia (omitted).</p>
<p>▲ Designated Postal Routes: The area for carrying mail stipulated in the contract is based on the routes currently operated by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships. The postal routes agreed upon by both parties are five in total: (A) The Yangtze River area up to Hankou, with mail loaded six times a week, and about eight ships carrying it; (B) The South China area to Guangdong (Panyu), once a week; (C) The Beiyang area to Tianjin, about three times a week; (D) The Wenzhou area to Yongjia, once a week; (E) The Ningbo area to Yinxian, three times a week.</p>
<p>▲ Postal Fees: The standard for paying fees is based on the area occupied by the mail. It has now been stipulated that the Hankou line will occupy 200 cubic feet per ship each time, with a quarterly fee of 12,600 yuan; the Panyu line will occupy 400 cubic feet, with a quarterly fee of 900 yuan; the Tianjin line will occupy 300 cubic feet, with a quarterly fee of 1,016 yuan; the Yongjia line will occupy 240 cubic feet, with a quarterly fee of 270 yuan; the Yinxian line will occupy 480 cubic feet, with a quarterly fee of 540 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Implemented on July 1: After the contract was signed, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has notified the ships to set up mail storage rooms on the ships. From July 1, commercial ships on the Yangtze River, Beiyang, and Ningbo-Wenzhou routes have been ordered to start loading. However, it is stipulated that after this mail transportation contract is signed, the ships are not allowed to carry private letters, and after the number of postal runs is stipulated, the shipping schedule and missing runs may not be changed at any time. In the event of special circumstances where the ship cannot operate according to the schedule, the company should give priority to entrusting the mail that should be loaded to other Chinese shipping companies, such as Sanbei, to carry it out to avoid delaying the export of mail.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Overseas Chinese <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Expelled from Japan After the War</p>
<p>During the January 28th War, overseas Chinese in Japan were insulted by the Japanese and gave up their businesses one after another to return home to avoid the disaster. Now that the war is over, overseas Chinese want to go to Japan to restore their businesses, but they are being rejected by the Japanese and are not allowed to land. In recent days, there have been many cases of Japanese expelling Chinese who went to Japan after the war back to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Prohibition of Going to Japan: The Japanese rejection of Chinese workers has long become a prominent fact. After the Shanghai War, the Japanese took the opportunity to prohibit overseas Chinese who had already left the East from going again, and ordered various Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai to issue announcements, stating that Chinese going to various ports in Japan must clearly state their detailed address and business when purchasing tickets and bring a certificate of permission to enter the country before they can purchase tickets. Those without a definite address and certificate will not be sold tickets, and please do not go to the East, because the ship ticket will still be paid by the passenger when they are returned due to being prohibited from landing.</p>
<p>▲ Going to the East to Resume Business: Overseas Chinese who returned home during the war left Japan in a hurry and mostly did not apply for a re-entry certificate to go again. Now that the Japanese can freely come to China to resume business, recently overseas Chinese from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian who have businesses in Japan have purchased tickets from the Japanese Post Office to Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, and other places to resume their businesses and close their shops. Unexpectedly, many of those who did not have a lamp certificate were not allowed to board the ship, and only those with a guarantee and a permit could go to Japan.</p>
<p>▲ Prohibition of Landing: When these overseas Chinese arrived in Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, Nagoya, and other ports, they were not allowed to land by the Japanese water police on the pretext of not having a certificate and were detained in the police station and insulted in every possible way before being escorted back to Shanghai on the original ship. There have been multiple batches of this in the past few days, including Chen Yonghua, Fang Zhuguan, Chen Famin, Yang Taijin, Lin Chihe, Yang Shenggen, Liu Zhenzhang, Jin Laidi, Lin Zaijin, Lin Jia Zhi, Lin Songben, Wang Chunjiu, Lin Xinjing, and more than 30 others were all expelled back to Shanghai, spending money on round-trip travel and watching their shops and property in Japan that they could not go to and move away. Therefore, everyone was extremely angry when they arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Liu Tongsheng Kidnapped by Bandits <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Intending to Get 20,000 Gold</p>
<p>▲ Wang A'lin and His Mistress Also Captured</p>
<p>▲ The Bandits Confessed to the Kidnapping in Great Detail</p>
<p>Liu Tongsheng, a comprador from Tianna Foreign Company's Western Medicine Department and a native of Jiujiang, was kidnapped by bandits at about 10:00 AM on the 6th in front of the Yijia house at 218 Yuezhou Road and driven to the jurisdiction of the First Branch of the Seventh District of Gao Langqiao Yinxian Township. Because they ran out of gasoline, the members of the local security corps rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and fought with the bandits, killing a bandit surnamed Zhang. A bandit named Qian Xuen, a native of Tongzhou, was captured on the spot, and a pistol was seized with two bullets inside. The hostage Liu Tongsheng was rescued. After receiving the report, the Huishan Concession Police sent Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng, Lin Kehsun, and scout Chen Ou Hai to bring the suspect Qian back to the police station. Another accomplice, Ji Jinhua, a native of Tongzhou, was captured at 155 Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. It was learned that there was another accomplice, Jiang Jingui, hiding in a house at 1290 Xieji Road in the Chinese territory, and Jiang was arrested at that address and taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The suspect Qian Xuen, Ji Jinhua, and the body of the bandit surnamed Zhang who was killed on the spot were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and inspection. Subsequently, Detective Lu, who was in charge of the case, etc., captured another accomplice, Wang A'lin (also known as Tang Hongfu and Tang Liancheng), a native of Tongzhou, and a woman named Lu Huangshi at 11 Kangti Road in the French Concession. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, Jiang Jingui, who was transferred from the Public Security Bureau, was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court, and Judge Shen Bingrong took the seat for interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and requested that after questioning, the case be postponed and combined with the interrogation of Qian Xuen and others. He also said that two coachmen from Liu Tongsheng's place would be in court to identify them today. According to Xia Qingqi, he has been working as a coachman at Liu's house for five years. When the master was kidnapped at the time, the defendant Wang A'lin was holding a pistol, threatening me loudly, and pushing me down in the car. The master's foot was injured. At the time, I heard a gunshot, but I didn't know who fired it. According to Sun Haitao, the assistant of Xia, at the time I only saw the defendant Qian Xuen, who was being transferred to the court yesterday, holding a pistol. I couldn't identify the others. When asked about Jiang Jingui's testimony, he said that he was a cart puller and knew Qian Xuen as a fellow villager. A week ago, he and a certain Jia came to my house and asked how my current situation was. I said that business was deserted and it was difficult to make a living. He also said that if I worked as a cart puller, I would never get rich. Now there is something. If it is settled, I will come and tell you again and left. The day before yesterday, Qian came again and told me to wait on Baoshan Road at about 9:00 AM to buy (omitted) rice for 10 copper coins and eat my fill. He said that at a certain place, at about 10:30, a car would pass by and he would ask me to help. Unexpectedly, I waited until noon and didn't see anything, so I returned home and was arrested. Qian did not clarify the kidnapping matter. The rest of the testimony was evasive. According to Wang A'lin's testimony, his surname was Tang, named Hongfu. Later, because he was adopted into the Wang family, he changed his name to A'lin and had no other name Liancheng. A friend named Ji Jinhe asked me to have tea in a nearby tea house. He said that there was a cousin Xia Qingqi who was a coachman in a certain family. He knew the details and could make a kidnapping business. He asked me to join. I said that this matter had to do with life and I didn't dare to do it. He said that I didn't need to be timid. There were no police around the house and it could be done. Three days later, he came to my house again and said that the driver and pistol had been found and it could be implemented. The day before the incident, I and Ji Jinhe, Qian Xuen, Ji Jinhua, and the deceased Zhang and others, a total of seven people, took the 18th Road trolleybus at 8:00 AM and got off in front of Liu's house on Yuezhou Road. We played in the middle of the road. At about 10:00 AM, we saw the God of Wealth coming out of the house and getting into a car we had prepared to go to a certain place to do business. We didn't take action that morning. We were recognizing the face of the God of Wealth. The next morning, those who went with me were Ji Jinhua, Qian Xuen, and the deceased Zhang, including myself, a total of four people. We still left at 8:00 AM and took the trolleybus to the front of Liu's house and waited. Ji Jinhe didn't go. At the time, the deceased Zhang first stepped forward and fired a shot to intimidate him, while Ji Jinhua was driving. I pushed Xia Qingqi down into the car. The deceased Zhang and Qian Xuen guarded the God of Wealth. I heard someone say that this matter would definitely get 20,000 gold and be divided into eight shares. Unexpectedly, the incident failed and I escaped home until I was arrested. Lu Huangshi is my mistress. She didn't know about this. According to her, she had only been in Shanghai from Tongzhou for half a month. It is true that she knew Wang (A'lin), but she didn't know anything else. Judge Shen ordered them to be remanded in custody separately and rescheduled to be tried together with Qian Xuen and others.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Tax on Production and Sales in Jiangxi Not Approved by Ministry <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi various industry associations' protest petition group issued a message stating that Jiangxi Province has established a special product production and sales tax, encompassing all imported, exported, locally produced, and locally sold goods, with offices set up everywhere. Its severity surpasses even the Likin tax. Take timber, a major product of Jiangxi, which is crucial to the livelihood of laborers and the province's economic prosperity or decline. For years, those who harvest timber in the mountains have suffered from exploitation by rampant bandits, while those who trade timber outside the province face competition from imported foreign pine. Since the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), business conditions have plummeted, with most businesses on their last breath, on the verge of collapse. Upon hearing that the provincial government was establishing a production and sales tax, all timber merchants were deeply distressed. They all said that after the numerous disasters, the remaining businesses could not bear the burden of such a harsh, disguised Likin tax. They would inevitably close down, which would affect the millions of laborers who depend on timber for their livelihood. These millions of laborers, suddenly unemployed, would inevitably resort to desperate measures and become bandits. The timber merchants believed that it was necessary to consider these potential consequences, so they resolutely decided to convene all timber businesses in the province, as well as timber guilds in Beijing, Changzhou, and Anhui, and sent a letter to the Nanchang Timber Industry Association, requesting them to convene a joint meeting. It was resolved to petition the provincial government to exempt them from the tax in order to relieve the merchants' difficulties and protect the people's lives, and also to telegraph to various central ministries and departments. Yesterday, it was learned that the Ministry of Finance had issued a reply stating: "National Government Ministry of Finance Express Mail Telegram, Ref. No. 337, Nanchang Timber Industry Association, read. Your winter telegram is noted. The matter of Jiangxi Province establishing a production and sales tax has not been approved by the Ministry. Please be informed, Finance Ministry Seal."</p>

<p>Letter of Thanks to Merchant Corps for Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai silver and money trade association sent a letter to the Municipal Council expressing its gratitude for the protection provided by the merchant corps during the wartime. The original letter stated, in brief, that during the Sino-Japanese conflict in the city, the association was at risk of being harassed, but thanks to the assistance of the Municipal Council, which dispatched members of the merchant corps to guard the front door, it was able to continue business as usual. The Director General of the Municipal Council recently replied to the association stating that he had received its letter of July 4, expressing its appreciation for the duties performed by the merchant corps during the emergency. He was extremely grateful and had forwarded the association's sentiments to Commander Thomas and notified all members of the corps.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau seized a large quantity of contraband narcotics on various ships during the past three months (from December 21 of this year to June 20). Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, the narcotics were transported to the Guanzhan Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, for incineration.

At 9:15 AM, the manager of the Guanzhan, McPherson, ordered the stokers and laborers to weigh and inspect all the narcotics and successively throw them into the kiln for incineration. The incineration was completed at 11:00 AM.

<p>Five Tendons Severed on Beautiful Woman's Foot</p>
<p>▲ Gu Linsheng's Methods Too Cruel</p>
<p>▲ Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Du Shen, a woman from Changzhou, 28 years old, had a long-standing affair with Gu Linsheng in her hometown. However, because her husband often interfered, they could not freely express their affection. Therefore, they fled together to Shanghai. The woman stayed with her aunt, Yang Gu, at 799 Zhejiang Road. Gu Linsheng would invite her to a hotel for pleasure every few days. Recently, Gu's finances had become very strained, and the woman began to treat him coldly. The intensity of her love depended entirely on the amount of money he had. This is a common ailment among modern young men and women, and these rural villagers were naturally unable to escape this pattern. Unfortunately, Gu was as foolish as a deer or pig and did not know how to read her face or recognize her emotions. He still clung to her and insisted on seeing her. The night before last, at midnight, he still wanted to invite her for an intimate encounter, but the woman sneered at him. Gu became enraged and left in a huff. Shortly after, he returned with four or five violent men. Gu grabbed a sharp axe and, because the woman had been unwilling to follow him, he hacked at her feet, causing axe wounds to her ankles and the calf of her right foot. Blood flowed freely. Zhang Huisheng and others, who lived with her, restrained Gu, and the others fled in all directions. The Lao Zha Police Station received a report and dispatched Detective Wang Yifei to the scene. The assailant and the weapon were taken to the police station for detention. The injured woman was sent to Renji Hospital, where doctors diagnosed that five tendons in her right foot had been severed. They performed emergency surgery, using fine copper wire to reconnect the severed tendons. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Gu to the First Special District Court. The injured woman also勉强勉强 appeared in court to testify. Judge Feng conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, argued that the defendant had intentionally injured someone and should be severely punished. The defendant admitted to the attack but claimed that he had only used a razor. Judge Feng concluded the hearing and sentenced Gu Linsheng to eight months of imprisonment as a warning. The injured woman was helped away by her relatives.</p>

<p>▲ Warrant Issued for Gu Baosen's Arrest</p>
<p>Film star Tan Ying accused architect Gu Baosen, who lived in the same residence, of seduction. Her mother, Tan Wang, acted as the plaintiff, accusing Gu Baosen of rape based on the article in the Criminal Code that treats sexual intercourse with a woman under the age of sixteen as rape, as Tan Ying was under the age of sixteen. Judge Shi held a hearing, but the defendant did not appear, and his family refused to accept the summons. Therefore, the court issued an arrest warrant, ordering the bailiffs to cooperate with Tan Wang to arrest Gu Baosen at his home in Dong Tang Lane. They were unable to find Gu Baosen. The bailiffs have reported this and are waiting for further arrest. The plaintiff has been instructed to inquire about Gu's whereabouts and report back so that he can be apprehended.</p>

<p>Yang Luoying, a Cantonese man, 17 years old, resided at No. 10, Zhenghe Lane, Xinqiao Street, French Concession. At about 3:00 PM on the 5th of this month, he went out to buy books and was walking past the entrance of Rundafa Bicycle Shop at No. 2 Guangxi Road. At that time, there was a strong wind, and suddenly Rundafa's billboard was blown down, falling on Yang's body and injuring his arm and abdomen. After being injured, Yang fell to the ground in extreme pain. Constable No. 554 spotted him and immediately recorded the shop's address and sent the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. He also reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, instructing detectives to investigate. Yang died from his injuries at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the Felun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, a report was filed with the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Li Ying to visit the morgue and examine the body. Constable No. 554 testified that he was on duty on Guangxi Road at the time and saw a person sitting on the ground in front of the Rundafa Bicycle Shop at No. 2.

<p>Zhou Yimo, a 41-year-old man from Nanjing residing at No. 720, Sanle Lane, Gordon Road, used to work as a customs broker. Due to the January 28th Incident, when Japanese troops invaded Shanghai, he was unemployed and living at home for half a year. In addition to his wife, he had six children, and the monthly expenses were enormous. Making a living was extremely difficult. Recently, he pawned almost everything he owned and was unable to find a way to make money. Therefore, he conceived the idea of death. Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM, he secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. By the time his wife noticed, it was too late, and he died immediately. The police officer from Post No. 3300 arrived and transported the body to Tongren Hospital by vehicle, and then to the morgue for examination.</p>

<p>▲ Jianghai Customs Notice</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs Wusong Sub-Customs was abolished last year, the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department has stipulated that cargo ships traveling between Wusong and Shanghai are divided into two categories. All ships carrying more than 200 dan of cargo and holding a nationality certificate from the Navigation Administration Bureau must report to the Shanghai South Sub-Customs. Those with a capacity of less than 200 dan must report for branding and registration at the Wusong Sub-Customs at the Paotaiwan, Wusong Estuary for inspection. Since the outbreak of the war this year, this procedure has been suspended. The Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department, Ke Dader, feared that if civilian ships were not inspected, bandit ships would inevitably mix in and smuggle contraband, making it impossible to crack down. Therefore, he issued a notice yesterday, ordering all civilian ships to report immediately. The notice is recorded below: "Jianghai Customs General Affairs Department Notice: Regarding the matter of all civilian ships traveling to and from this port, regardless of whether they are going to sea or not, with a capacity of more than or less than 200 dan, must now be branded and registered at the Nanshi Sub-Customs or Wusong Sub-Customs. Those with a capacity of more than 200 dan will be classified as one category, and those with a capacity of less than 200 dan will be classified as another category. In the future, when entering and leaving Wusong, they must also report to the Wusong Sub-Customs for verification of the registry. All civilian ship owners are hereby notified. General Affairs Department Tax Affairs Department Ke Dader."</p>

<p>▲ Police Officer Assaulting Employee Was a Personal Act</p>
<p>▲ Victim Wang Lu Has Sued the County Government</p>
<p>The section from Jiading to Luodian on the Shanghai-Tai long-distance bus line was previously involved in an incident where a police officer from the provincial capital's Public Security Team assaulted a ticket seller of the company on the bus and arrested the driver, Lu Yongchang, causing negotiations and leading to a strike by the employees of that section. It is now learned that the company has explained the misunderstanding to all parties, stating that the police officer's assault on the employee and the arrest of the driver were all personal matters. Obstructing traffic and causing a strike are the company's responsibilities, and the victims, Wang Yunlong and Lu Yongchang, have now hired lawyer Chen Zhaoqi and formally filed a lawsuit with the county government, so it is best to wait for the legal resolution. Therefore, the employees have all resumed work yesterday, and traffic has returned to normal. However, it is reported that Wang and Lu are still in the Jiading Hospital.</p>

<p>The British Company's Pudding Wheel struck and sank the Texaco oil tanker. The ship was also damaged. Because it was newly built and the hull was strong, the damage was relatively minor. The previous two days, it was anchored at River 35. A large number of technicians were sent to the ship for repairs. Yesterday, it was already able to sail. Because the ship was loaded with silk and tea, it could not be delayed for a long time. Therefore, the ship left Shanghai yesterday and went straight to London. The ship collision case was handed over to the company for negotiations. The issue of responsibility will be brought before the shipping officials at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Kang Wheel was sunk after being rammed by the Japanese Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Tatsuno Maru at sea off Chengshanjiao, Shandong, at about 1:00 PM on July 20, 1929. It has been nearly three years since the incident, and there is no hope of resolution. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Sino-Japanese issue has become increasingly complicated, and the resolution of this case is even more distant. Because the families of the victims heard that there was a rumor that the negotiations were being abandoned, which was extremely unfavorable to them, they convened a general meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss the next steps.</p>

<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers, as usual, holds an annual meeting once in the second half of each year, specializing in reading papers, discussing the articles of association, and investigating the local industrial situation for exploration and assistance in construction. The annual meeting of the association was originally scheduled to be held in Wuhan, but due to the instability of the local area and the inconvenience of transportation, it is now decided to change the venue to Tianjin. The meeting is tentatively scheduled to be held after August 20 and before September 10. Preparations are now underway. In addition to the routine meeting schedule, it is also necessary to inspect important factories and mines in North China and visit nearby scenic spots, which is closely related to the future development of China's engineering community. In addition, members who attend the meeting every year take boats and cars, and there is a discount method. This year, the same old example will be followed. The General Assembly will submit requests to various transportation agencies for preferential treatment as in previous years. It is predicted that the number of people attending the meeting will be very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese Volunteer Team, which returned to the motherland to join the army to resist Japan, was ordered to disband after the Shanghai truce agreement was signed and the military affairs ended. In the capital, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission gave each person 150 yuan, but they were defrauded by someone, and all the team members were penniless. Therefore, they came to Shanghai to seek assistance from the Guangzhou-Zhaoqing Association. They stayed at the Da'an Hotel. After waiting for two weeks, the association gave each person 20 yuan. After paying for the hotel expenses, there was little left. The association had no intention of providing further assistance. Therefore, they went to No. 38 Weihaiwei Road to seek help from the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association. Unexpectedly, Mr. Gao Guangjing, the minister of the association, said that he was unable to provide assistance. Therefore, they had no choice but to raise funds from all walks of life so that they could return to Guangdong as soon as possible and return to the overseas business.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the news item regarding the rent exemption in Fansheng Lane in today's issue of your newspaper, it states that "the landlord, relying on being a foreign merchant, initially refused to exempt any rent, but after repeated requests from the tenants and seeing the general trend, he could not maintain a different opinion and agreed to reduce the rent for two months." Upon investigation, after the cessation of hostilities between China and Japan this year and the restoration of police authority by the Municipal Council, our office first sent a letter to the tenants of Fansheng Lane on April 12, stating that we would voluntarily exempt rent for two months. How can it be said that we "relied on being a foreign merchant and refused to exempt any rent"? This is clearly inconsistent with the facts and may cause confusion. Therefore, we have sent this letter to be published and corrected. Sincerely, to the distinguished editors of the Shanghai News Department of Shen Bao. Respectfully, Gao Yi Mansion Rental Office, July 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Declaration of Initiation of the China Promotion of Civil Governance Association <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Ma Xiangbo</p>
<p>As the people of our nation face successive national crises, it is the people who suffer. If the people do not save themselves, who will save them? The way to save them, in terms of the nation, lies in politics, and there is no other way. To defend against natural disasters and enemy-caused calamities, no matter who is in power or what politician it is, can they succeed without using the people's wealth and power? Can a few people plan for others and succeed, while we, the masses, cannot plan for ourselves? Therefore, based on the psychology of self-love and loyalty to self-rescue, we have created the China Promotion of Civil Governance Association and hereby reveal the key points to all compatriots:</p>
<p>1.  Looking at the history of all nations, they all first have land and the indigenous people who live on it. The people's livelihood depends on the use of the land, and the method of using the land lies in agriculture and industry. The method of protecting the land lies in national defense, the national defense of the sea, land, and air, and the management of agriculture, animal husbandry, water, fire, construction, and forestry. Can these be competently and innovatively handled without the entire nation's participation? Therefore, historically speaking, civil governance should be used.</p>
<p>2.  Philosophically speaking about national politics, according to the Sequence Hexagram of the Book of Changes, "There are all things, then there are men and women, husband and wife, father and son," which accumulate to form families. The reason why there must be all things is that people must rely on external things to defend and nourish their lives. According to this, it is natural human rights. Then, from families, there accumulate civilized clans and ethnic groups with etiquette, hierarchy, and civilization. Every inch of land and every individual is defended by the nation's financial resources, and all must fight with the same hatred to achieve victory, like King Tang's campaign against Chou Xiang, seeking revenge for ordinary men and women. However, the collection of people's wealth and the requisition of people's labor, which is the people's lives, can only be carried out by the sovereign power stipulated in the national constitution. It cannot be forcibly seized and manipulated by one person, one family, one party, or one class. To do so is what Mencius called acting unjustly and killing the innocent. This greatly violates justice. The people should, based on justice, restore their right to self-governance and constitutionalism. If this is presented to the people of the world, there will be no denial.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Speaking of the theory of evolution, there is actually nothing extraordinary about it. We have long known Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest: big insects eat small insects, the strong swallow the weak. Everyone is accustomed to it, but we just haven't systematized these facts.</p>
<p>In ancient China, there were also many thinkers about spontaneous generation. For example, Zhuangzi is a representative of Chinese evolution theory. Zhuangzi's book once recorded:</p>
<p>(Zhuang Zhou dreamed of becoming a butterfly, a butterfly fluttering happily! Did he know that he was content or not? Did he not know that he was Zhou? Suddenly he awoke, and he was abruptly Zhou! Did Zhou dream of becoming a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream of becoming Zhou? Zhou and the butterfly must have a distinction. This is called "the transformation of things." (See Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters, Wandering Freely)</p>
<p>Zhuangzi indulged in wild thoughts, becoming a butterfly in a dream, saying it was "the transformation of things." It was originally naive and mysteriously laughable. However, isn't it equally laughable to Western evolutionists who believe that humans evolved from monkeys!</p>
<p>Similar to the idea of "humans evolved from monkeys," there is also a passage in Zhuangzi's Chapter on Supreme Happiness:</p>
<p>(There is seed, which becomes a Qi when it gets water. When it gets the juncture of water and earth, it becomes the clothing of a poisonous clam. When it grows on a mound, it becomes lingxie. When lingxie gets a lush place, it becomes blackfoot. The root of blackfoot becomes a grub. Its leaf becomes a butterfly. The butterfly, Xuye, transforms and becomes an insect, which lives under the stove. Its shape is like shedding, and its name is quzhuo. The quzhuo of a chick becomes a bird in a thousand days, and its name is ganyu gu. The foam of ganyu gu becomes simi. Simi becomes vinegar. Yi Lu is born from vinegar. Huang Ni is born from Jiu You. Mao Rui is born from rotten Quan. Yang Xi is like Bu Zhi Jiu bamboo, producing Qing Ning. Qing Ning produces Cheng. Cheng produces horses. Horses produce humans. Humans then return to the machine. All things come from the machine, and all things enter the machine.)</p>
<p>Zhuangzi's theory of evolution is more mysterious, more thorough, and more intense than Darwin's theory of evolution! Darwin's theory of evolution says that humans evolved from monkeys; Zhuangzi says that humans evolved from horses. Then, isn't Zhuangzi's theory of evolution more mysterious? Zhuangzi not only said "horses produce humans," but also went backwards, even saying "there is seed," isn't that more thorough and more intense than Darwin's "Origin of Species"? However, monkeys are monkeys, horses are horses, and humans are humans. Facts tell us that things each have their own species, truly "not related at all."</p>
<h3 id="e171">Epitaph for the Martyrdom of My Brother's Wife, Madam Ma, in the National Crisis <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Wenzhi</p>
<p>In the spring of the Ren Shen year, the Japanese attacked Shanghai. My Nineteenth Route Army, led by Cai Tingkai and others, resisted them. After more than a month of stalemate, the enemy landed from Liuhe and Yanglin in my county. Our army retreated to Loucheng. The enemy followed, dropping bombs from airplanes like rain. My clan brother Wenquan's wife, Madam Ma, was ill and unable to get up. She was killed by a bomb in Beihou Alley, north of the North City. Her body and bed were thrown into the neighboring house. At that time, Wenquan was serving in the army in Jiangxi. Her elder brothers Wen Shou and Wen Cui had already separated from her. At this time, they fled into the countryside. Two days later, she was finally laid to rest. Everyone who saw or heard of it was saddened. Three months later, her husband's elder brother, Wenzhi, respectfully recorded the matter in the family records and wrote an inscription with tears. My brother's wife's surname was Ma, given name Xienan, daughter of Ma Guren, a scholar of Songjiang. Her mother was Madam Xu. She became an orphan at the age of three and lived with her uncle, Xu Bicheng. She successively studied at the Suzhou Girls' School and the Wulou Zhengze School. At the age of twenty, she came to marry into my Tang family as the fourth wife of Jiting Gong. She served her parents-in-law with utmost filial piety. Wenquan traveled and lived abroad, and she always went with him. They endured hardships and separation and never had a day of rest. She gave birth to eight children, five of whom died young. Those who survived were her daughter Qinghong and her sons Qingzhuo and Qingfu. At the time of my brother's wife's death, Qinghong and Qingzhuo were by her side. They heard the sound of airplanes rattling around the corner of the house and hurriedly told the children to go to the front building to avoid them. Suddenly, there was a loud crash. The ground cracked and the sky collapsed. The building tilted. My brother's wife passed away. Her mother, Madam Xu, was pressed under the stove. Qinghong and Qingzhuo were terrified. They jumped down from the window and ran out the door. Soldiers blocked the road. Qingzhuo cried for help. A soldier took him away. It was not until the next day that he was able to return. Qinghong ran in panic to the Yulou School and saw a military officer climbing over the wall. She knelt down and cried, "My mother is dead! My grandmother still has sounds of calling. Please go and save her!" The military officer then led soldiers to drag Madam Xu out of the rubble. She fainted and was revived. Qingfu was being cared for by a wet nurse in the countryside. It was not until a month later that he was found. Alas, alas. Peace came only at the summer solstice. We then set up an altar and performed the ceremony. Alas, my brother's wife was a weak woman who studied and understood great righteousness. She could not wield weapons to defend the country. She only suffered a tragic end due to her frail health. Her mother, alone and helpless, was overwhelmed with grief. If the spirits in the afterlife know, they will not rest in peace. The responsibility for the calamity of Zha Yang does not belong to anyone but me. The inscription reads:</p>
<p>Since ancient times, good warfare has been subjected to heavenly punishment. What comes out of you returns to you. Blessings and calamities are divided between good and evil. How could one expect to suffer disaster without cause? The flying bird casts a shadow, leaving an ominous sound. The shaking house hides families in the dimness. Ascending to heaven and entering the earth is a difficult and righteous task. I grieve for my brother's wife, whose righteous deeds are fragrant, sacrificing her life for the glory of the country. Thunder and lightning hide the darkness with fortitude. Suddenly, the tears well up as I gaze. I cannot bear to leave this high hall. I pity these young children who are dying. My eyes reach thousands of miles, my heart is wounded in spring. The waters of Loujiang flow forever, vast and boundless.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A Wooden Leg as a Safe. A poor woman in England was admitted to an American hospital due to illness, requesting free treatment. She stayed for five years, receiving very careful treatment from the doctors. Unexpectedly, just as the treatment was about to be completed, it was discovered that her wooden prosthetic leg was actually a safe deposit box inside a bank, containing 650 British pounds in cash, equivalent to more than 6,500 Mexican silver dollars. As a result, the hospital filed a lawsuit, demanding that this woman who pretended to be poor pay for medical and hospital expenses, calculated at one gold dollar per day, for a total of five years. This amount is also considerable.</p>
<p>Similar cases of hoarding cash are not uncommon. There was a female miser who hid money in various parts of her house, one thousand here, ten thousand there. Even she herself couldn't keep track. Later, she died, and her descendants had to accept her inheritance. They had to completely demolish the house to search for it one by one.</p>
<p>According to surveys, the total amount of gold hidden in Britain is about 400 million British pounds in cash or banknotes. Many people hide it in unimaginable places and it never circulates. According to some economists, the decline in the global economic situation is partly due to these cash-hoarding misers.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Vow to Launch the Northern Expedition, Wounds of the Past and Present <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Today marks exactly six full years since the National Revolutionary Army vowed to launch the Northern Expedition. On July 9, 1926, the Revolutionary Army vowed its oath at the East Campus in Guangzhou. The ceremony was grand, and the military appearance was magnificent. On that day, more than 20,000 people from the Navy, Army, Gendarmerie, and Whampoa Military Academy students arrived. Wu Zhihui, representing the Central Party Headquarters, presented the flag, which read, "Implement the overthrow of the warlords, tools of imperialism." Chiang Kai-shek bowed and accepted it. At that time, the people of the whole country were suffering from the oppression of warlords and the invasion of powerful neighbors. They yearned for the success of the Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition very much. Therefore, it set out to Hunan, recovered Wuhan in October, and stabilized the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In the spring of 1927, it recovered the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In the spring of 1928, it continued the Northern Expedition and recovered Beijing in June, unifying the country. It has been six full years since then. Looking around at the situation in which the people of the whole country find themselves, there is the oppression of imperialists from the outside, and the instigation of the remaining warlords from the inside. Years of civil war, bandits everywhere, and repeated disasters have plunged the people into misery. Thinking about it quietly, one cannot help but sigh.</p>
<p>In the past six years, foreign affairs and domestic politics have been unbearable to look back on. Excerpts from the Central Party Headquarters' declaration of departure on that day are compared with today's reality. Is there a difference? There is no difference, and it is even more severe. (The plight of the Chinese people has reached its extreme today. Speaking of farmers, the fruits of their blood and sweat are entirely used to supply the looting of soldiers and bandits. The pre-collection of special taxes has increased endlessly. Hard work all year round does not bring enough to eat. Selling fields and cattle has gradually led to unemployment. Wherever soldiers and bandits pass, villages are reduced to ruins. The old and weak die in ditches, and the young are mostly captured. Men are treated as cattle and horses, and women are raped. Speaking of workers, they work all day long, and the fruits of their labor can only barely sustain their lives. They have no surplus and no security. Usually, they are always in danger of losing their jobs. When disaster strikes, they cannot help but fall into the ranks of vagrants. Speaking of merchants, they are oppressed from the outside by foreign merchants selling foreign goods and transporting local goods, and from the inside by the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies and blatant extortion of large and small warlords and bandits. Bankruptcies are common. Speaking of the intellectual class, teachers are always worried about their salaries being overdue, unable to transmit their wisdom. Students are often plagued by banditry, cutting off their resources and unable to advance their studies. Schools are closed due to the fires of war every year. Elementary school teachers have become coolies. Others, such as the soldiers under the command of warlords in various provinces, are mostly farmers and workers who have joined the army to seek a living. However, after joining the army, not only is there still no guarantee of a livelihood, but they are also driven to their deaths by ambitious warlords. Their good blood is not used to pacify the country and save the people, but rather to kill the people for the sake of the warlords' support, to fight for fame and wealth for the warlords. What is more tragic than this?). (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Alas, although the times are six years apart, the situation is no different from the past. Looking around, the country is fragmented, and it is unbearable to mention the painful things again. In addition, the Northeast has fallen, and the map has changed color. Guangdong, the source of the revolution, is willing to engage in civil war at this time of national crisis, but shrinks back from resisting foreign aggression. Revolutionary soldiers have been reduced to this. Reflecting on the past and present, one cannot help but sigh deeply.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Twenty Years Ago's Hatred of Heaven (Below) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Tianhen</p>
<p>National subjugation, racial extinction, partition – all people across the nation have heard of it and known it for a long time. But it was not expected that crises would continue to erupt, and the danger of national subjugation and racial extinction would become even more imminent. Internal worries and external troubles intersect and encroach upon each other. The Republic of China is in danger, alas, in great danger.</p>
<p>The Three Eastern Provinces are the Three Eastern Provinces of the Chinese people, but they cannot be the Three Eastern Provinces of China. The terms "South Manchuria" and "North Manchuria" are simply a map delineating the partition of my Three Eastern Provinces by Japan and Russia. South of Harbin is the sphere of influence of the Japanese. No, it is the territory of the Japanese. North of Harbin is the sphere of influence of the Russians. No, it is also the territory of the Russians. But it was not expected that it would not only be a sphere of influence or a territory, but even the right of residence of the Chinese people has been taken away. This is truly not treating us Chinese people as human beings. What is tolerable, what is not tolerable?</p>
<p>Oh, my people, are my people really going to sit by and watch the Japanese and Russians insult and humiliate us, causing our country to fall into death? The Republic of China, the Republic of China exchanged for by force, and it is actually powerless to deal with violent neighbors? Do my people not all have the heart of "rather die than live without freedom"? If we do not quickly devise a method of resistance and confrontation, my people will only die. Rather than sitting and waiting to die as slaves, it is better to die in battle as brave ghosts. When I look at the flag of three colors, I only think of seeking the blue sky and white sun in red blood. Alas.)</p>
<p>The Chinese Revolution has been going on for twenty years, and Mr. Dai Jitao has also become one of the important figures in the central government, jointly wielding the power of governance. However, the weakness of the national situation is even worse than before, and there is a lament that it is getting worse every day. Throughout the Qing Dynasty and after sixteen years of rule by the warlord government, the name of Manchuria as Chinese territory could still be preserved, but it cannot be preserved after the success of the revolution. This is something that none of the giants of the people's party and Mr. Jitao could have expected. When Mr. Jitao was a newspaper reporter, Manchuria was only under the intangible control of Japan and Russia, and he still issued dangerous words to awaken the people, saying that rather than sitting and waiting to die as slaves, it is better to die in battle as brave ghosts. Now that he holds the power of national governance, he can carry out his ambitions. However, he has remained silent. For the past nine months, all that has been heard is that he has initiated the establishment of a secret Buddhist Golden Light Dao Field in the Yonghe Temple in Beiping, passively praying to quell the chaos, and wanting to rely on boundless Buddhist Dharma to shift the calamity. Compared with the positivism of twenty years ago, he is like two different people. Writing this far, I can only end my article with Mr. Jitao's own words: "Alas." What else can I say? What else can I say?</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Discussion of the Nail-Making Industry <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Huasheng</p>
<p>Wire nails, known in the West as Wire Nails, are commonly known as "foreign nails." According to historical records, imported foreign nails were originally invented in France. Their import into our country was also earliest from France. Therefore, foreign nails are also called "French nails." In 1880, Germany and France began to transport and sell these products to the United States. Because they met the needs of the people of that country, those who engaged in this business once held a temporary monopoly. By 1917, the United States was able to manufacture 17 million barrels of the same nails itself. By 1927, this had increased to more than 29 million barrels. From the quantity of products, one can imagine the scale of the equipment. There are also more than 30 nail factories of various sizes in Japan. The two largest are attached to state-run steel mills, producing more than 1,000 barrels of wire nails per day. Statistics show that the annual output of nails in Japan is about 3 million barrels. In addition to a small number of sales to Nanyang and various provinces in Northeast China, the rest is for domestic use. Due to their high quality and high price, American-made large quantities of wire nails are not easily sold in foreign markets.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Chinese people have advocated domestic products, and the call has been loud. Various machine-made Western-style goods have sprung up like mushrooms, and wire nails have emerged in response to the needs of the times.</p>
<p>After the revolution, Hubei had a Hanyang Needle and Nail Factory. Unfortunately, it closed down before any goods were shipped. According to research, the first successful imitation in our country was Mr. Huang Shifu of the Shanghai Gongqin Iron Factory. All the nail-making machines, large and small, in the factory were designed and manufactured by itself. It now produces 15,000 barrels of nails per month, making it the leader among nail factories in this port. There are now nine other nail factories, both Chinese and foreign, large and small, with a total monthly output of 40,000 to 50,000 barrels, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the whole country. Therefore, in recent years, the import of foreign nails, except for the provinces in the Northeast, has been almost entirely replaced by domestic products. The result of Gongqin Factory's ten years of hard work has somewhat supplemented the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Financial: Gold Standard - Supply Exceeds Demand <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲ Continued Slight Decline of Two Taels: Yesterday's gold market was complex, marked by initial rises and subsequent falls. Trading was varied, with hesitant sentiment causing a swing of twelve taels in the overall market. Afterward, prices dipped slightly by a couple of taels. The initial opening saw gains, briefly breaking through the 770-tael mark. Although the silver market reported gains, it had no impact, primarily due to the lack of progress expected from the Lausanne Conference. The market then became unpredictable, fluctuating around 70 taels. While exchange rates experienced minor fluctuations, the overwhelming selling pressure led to a weakening trend. The market's volatility was similar to the previous day, fueled by the oversupply of exchange notes, causing a sharp drop of eight to nine taels to 60.05 taels. It eventually stabilized, hovering between 62 and 63 taels, but further changes are feared. The morning and afternoon market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Early Opening Still Up One Tael: From an early opening of 766.7 taels for August, an increase of 1.8 taels, large bars returned to a spread of 3/16 to 1/8. American silver was up 1/4, and the European market was stable. However, exchange rates slightly rose by 1/2 percent, followed by complexity, with fluctuating transactions among various firms. Therefore, fluctuations of over one tael occurred. Hengyu, Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongtongchun, and Richang were all buying, while Tongtaichang and Bingxing were selling. The US dollar remained stable, and Mitsui showed strong demand, purchasing 29,125 taels for this month, 25 for next month, and 625 for November. Additionally, 1,775 taels of British gold were settled for October. This drove the gold price up by four to five taels to 71.8 taels. HSBC's quoted price remained unchanged at 70.08 taels, but there were momentary swings of one tael. HSBC absorbed 29 dollars of July US gold, and Yifeng, Yongzhifeng, Yongyuantai, Daxing, Yongda, Decheng, and Futaiheng competed to purchase. Approximately 625 taels of August British gold were traded among banks, reaching 72.4 taels at 9:40 AM. Subsequently, Yuanheng, Bingxing, Tongtaichang, Fuyu, Hongkangyong, and others sold, causing a small drop of three taels, falling to 69.2 taels in just seven or eight minutes, then rising again to 70.08 taels. Small investors came in to buy. Later, Hengxing, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Yuanda, Yongyuanmao, Yongdadecheng, Shunli, Yifeng, Zhaofengchang, and others all sold heavily, and the exchange market also loosened, with British gold settleable at 75 and US gold at 25 for September. Therefore, the price plummeted to 66 taels at 10:20 AM. In an instant, it rebounded, with Mitsui absorbing 5,625 taels for November. Yuanmaoyongbing and Yuanhengfuyu Chunyuanyongqian Changxiangyuantai Yuanxingyong and others successively bought, and some short sellers took advantage of the opportunity to cover their positions, causing the price to rise by five taels. From 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, there were fluctuations of one tael, reaching 71 taels after 11:10 AM. Then, HSBC released 75 of October British gold, and McCalley released 4,375 of October US gold, and 75 of September British gold became settleable, causing the gold price to fall again. However, there were sudden fluctuations of over three taels around 11:30 AM. Ultimately, there were more sellers, with Hengyu, Hengxing, and the Dalian gang all selling, bringing the price down to 67.23 taels at the noon close, up 7 taels 9 qian. Speculators slightly bought.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon: Many Ups and Downs: The afternoon market opened at 68.3 taels, and Fuyu bought, bringing it to 69.4. McCalley absorbed half a dollar of October US gold, with 5,625 ins and outs of November. Then, it seemed to weaken. 625 of November was absorbed by Taiwan Mitsui Sumitomo, and Yuanmaoyong Honghongkangyong Yondadecheng Qianchangxiang Hengyu Yifengyong and others excitedly sold, and the price plummeted by five to six taels, reaching 63.3 taels at 2:30 PM. At this time, October US gold could be sold for 5,625 by banks, and the market was sluggish. However, speculators took the opportunity to short sell, causing a surge of two taels in one minute to 65.5 taels. After that, there were fluctuations of two taels, and people's hearts were unsettled. The chaotic state of the market was unstoppable. After 3:30 PM, the decline intensified. September US gold was 4,375, October was 625, and Zhifengyong Hengyu Yuanmaoyong Taifengcheng Zhaofengchang Bingxing Xiexingyong Yionyuantai and others showed a strong desire to sell, causing the price to plummet by over four taels, finally reaching 60.05 taels at 4:00 PM. Afterward, Hengyu Yuanmaoyong bought, and Tongtaichang Hongkangyong also bought, and Shoufengyong sold 8,125 of November US gold to Zhenjin, so they entered into forward contracts, causing the price to rise by a couple of qian, to 3.2 qian at 4:30 PM. It then closed at 2.3 qian, a further decline of 2.6 qian compared to the previous day. The highest price for the whole day was 72.4 taels, and the lowest was 60.5 taels, a swing of 11.9 taels, hence the double settlement price. Bare taels increased by 7.5 to 8 taels, and the listed price was still 838 taels, a range of 66 to 72 taels. The noon price was 70 taels, around 70 taels in the afternoon, then 78 taels, and finally 75 taels, more than the previous day by two taels. The pre-listing market was 68 taels, and the post-listing market was 62 taels. The pre-supplementary market was 66 taels, and the post-supplementary market was 60 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Foreign Exchange: Weakened with the Gold Market <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market reported gains, with exchange rates rising for British and falling for American currency. HSBC's listed prices in this city showed no positive signs except for a slight decrease of half a yuan for the German exchange rate. Internally, there was some weakening, especially in British gold. It remained stable in the morning, then fluctuated, while the US dollar was initially stable, then strong, and then loosened. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in the gold market, it also weakened, causing anxiety and confusion. The result was a slight increase compared to the previous day, with British gold up 125 and American gold also up 125. Trading activity was relatively brisk, with nearly 200,000 pounds in British gold traded, with some gains for gold firms. Approximately one million dollars in American gold were traded, mostly sold, to convert into gold. Banks such as Mitsui showed good buying interest. Transactions varied among Chinese and foreign banks. Citibank bought in both the morning and afternoon markets. Outside of the Lausanne Conference still showing no progress, there were no other major news, it is said. The exchange rates are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange: The domestic market had a difference of 125 throughout the day. The selling price in the morning was 1 shilling 7 pence 625 to 75, and the buying price was 6875 to 8125. The noon close was the same. Trading was quiet in the afternoon, with the closing selling price at 75 to 875 and the buying price at 8125 to 9375.</p>
<p>▲ American Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by 375 throughout the day. The morning selling price for this month was 29.125 dollars, August 1875, September 3125, October 4375, November 5625, and the buying price was 25 to 6875. The noon closing selling price was 1875 to 625, and the buying price was 3125 to 375. The afternoon closing selling price was 3125 for this month, 375 for August, half a yuan for September, 625 for October, and 75 to 6875 for November, with the buying price increasing by 125 for each month. The listed price was one yuan, equivalent to 3 taels 4 qian 9 fen 345, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Forward Rate for Large Bills Up 0.0625 <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>According to an August 8th report from the National Society in London, the short-term rate for large bills remained unchanged at 16 pence 3/4, while the long-term rate increased by 1/16 to 16 pence 13/16. The exchange rate between London and New York opened at 3 dollars 57 cents 3/4.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Issue of Adopting the Silver Dollar Standard <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Sudden Surge in Silver Cents</p>
<p>A special atmosphere suddenly emerged in the market yesterday morning. After a long period of market weakness, a novel situation arose, drawing attention. It was learned that the good omen was due to the Minister of Finance's advocacy for adopting the silver dollar standard. He had convened leaders of the financial community the day before yesterday to propose its implementation as soon as possible. Banks strongly supported this matter, while money shops needed to consider the situation of various industries carefully.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Cent and Loan Rate Diverge: The silver cent suddenly surged by 0.06875 in the early morning market, reaching 0.6955 yuan. The price remained the same in the afternoon market, showing a very strong trend, supposedly related to long positions being closely held. The silver loan rate was 0.06 in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly lower by 0.01 compared to the previous day. There was no added interest on overnight loans, and transactions were clear.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coins Increase in Unison: Due to the sharp rise in the silver cent, subsidiary coins inevitably increased as well. The early morning price for small Jiangnan silver coins was 0.06055 yuan, and 0.0608 yuan in the afternoon market, an increase of 0.075 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 8,500 yuan in the morning market and 5,500 yuan in the afternoon market. The early morning price for small Guangdong silver coins was 0.05875 yuan, and 0.0589 yuan in the afternoon market, an improvement of 0.055 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 200,500 yuan in the morning market and 100,500 yuan in the afternoon market. Copper coins also decreased by 4,500 strings, to 425,500 strings. The trading volume was 44,670 strings.</p>
<p>▲ Fewer Silver Receipts, More Silver Dollar Receipts: Yesterday's silver receipts at banks showed 2.45 million for Chinese merchants, 1.9 million for foreign merchants, and 7 million for exchange notes, goods mortgages, taxes, and miscellaneous items. Silver dollar receipts were substantial due to excessive silver dollar transactions, reaching as high as 3 to 4 million. Outgoing warehouse: 1.3 million, remittance funds: 3+ million. Silver shop and money shop receipts were 27 million, 4.7 million, exchange funds from all districts totalled over 800,000, and cash income was over 100,000, paper money totalled 65,000 in the morning market, and 45,000 in the afternoon market, outside the exchange floor paper money traded a total of 170,000 in the morning market, and 85,000 in the afternoon market. Check transactions: 50,000 in the morning, and 25,000 in the afternoon, bank transactions totalled 2.2 million in the morning market, and 1.2 million in the afternoon market. There were over 1-2 million in additional transactions. Banks exchanged 2.22 million to silver dollar customers, paper money turnover totalled 2.3-2.4 million, Silver shop and money shop silver dollar order receipts totalled over 8.55 million, silver dollar overnight loan funds totalled over 4.3-4.4 million, silver dollar loan advances and withdrawals totalled over 4.5-4.6 million. Since there were too many silver dollar transactions, and the transactions were purely made among professionals and banks, so all transactions occurred within professional circles, and there were no reports of commercial clients. Small silver shops totalled over 900,000.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Securities: The Government Bond Market Remains Lifeless <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (August 8), the various bond markets at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced thin trading despite multiple bonds opening for trading. The total volume was only 17,000 yuan. Futures for July and August were mostly opened, but due to the cooling of sentiment and the lack of market turnaround, only sporadic transactions occurred for each bond, with a total trading volume of 2.43 million. The bond market remained as dull as before, with balanced supply and demand, and no market vitality. Only in the early morning did prices rise by about 0.05 to 0.06 yuan compared to the previous day due to good demand. Subsequently, they fluctuated downward, but the trend remained stable throughout, and the sluggish situation did not differ from the past. As a result, only several August futures contracts, such as the Reorganization, Disbandment, 1920 Customs, and Rolled Bonds, rose significantly compared to the end of the previous month due to the lack of trading. Although the July futures and spot contracts of other bonds were generally slightly firm, the volume was very small.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Turns Weak <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market turned weak again because US cotton prices fell, and sentiment was slightly weak. However, the trend was still firm. Cantonese merchants were still holding August futures contracts, with huge amounts. Purchases from Changsha and Shantou were also strong. Some private telegrams reported serious insect pests in US cotton. Because of this, speculators were still buying to go long. The market fluctuated unpredictably. However, short sellers were inclined to sell due to the domestic economic downturn. However, the foreign cotton market has been trending upward recently, so Rongxing, a long seller, remained unmoved. The future is hard to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Man-Made Yarn: Falling by Four to Five Qian: The opening of the man-made yarn market trended downward because the price of American cotton fell by twenty basis points. There were more sellers in the market. Each month was down by one tael, with a fluctuation between one and two qian in the second and third rounds. In the afternoon, it was heard that American cotton news was still advantageous to long sellers. Buyers were also strong, and each month increased by four, five, and six qian. Total transactions for the day were 26,500 bales. It was found that Yunkang sold 1,000 bales, Tongyu sold 600 bales, Taichang sold 700 bales, Changfeng sold 700 bales, Jifeng sold 500 bales, Ruida sold 650 bales, and Dachang sold 550 bales. Changfeng bought 4,250 bales, Rongxing bought 750 bales, Gengfeng bought 1,100 bales, and Yicheng bought 850 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>October: 1463, down .05, 78300 bales</p>
<p>July: 1443, down .04, 17950 bales</p>

<p>September: 1461, up .07, 61950 bales</p>
<p>Total: 130950 bales</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Consumption Still Active: The removal of spot yarn is still good. Purchase volume is good. The average value in cotton sales continues to increase. The various banks that bought in were estimated to total 2,920 bales, and the number of professional purchasers who bought in was 140. The market continues to be strong. The customer bank Guangdong province bought 1,605 bales, Shantou bought 300 bales, Changsha bought 700 bales, Luzhou bought 55 bales, Yunnan province bought 20 bales, Ningbo bought 15 bales, Jiangxi bought 50 bales, mainland buyers bought 85 bales, Fujian bought 10 bales, northern buyers bought 10 bales, and Xiamen bought 50 bales.</p>

<p>▲ Impact of the Fall in US Cotton:</p>
<p>After several days of consecutive rises, US cotton prices broke through the six-cent mark the day before yesterday, but now they have fallen back by twenty basis points, causing the enthusiastic sentiment to diminish slightly. The market turned downward. However, a certain foreign merchant still tends to buy, with an amount of tens of thousands of piculs, mostly forward trading. However, Xincheng, a large merchant, continues to sell, accumulating more and more, and the American cotton trading house telegrams reported serious pest damage. Therefore, there are many who are long. The future will depend on the progress of American cotton.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao Down 0.03 Yuan: The Zheng Biao market opened in the morning, falling with US cotton. The market atmosphere was stagnant. Prices for each month fell by five to six qian. In the afternoon, news was heard that US cotton was still favorable for long positions, and the market rose again by two to three qian. Total transactions for the day were 69,700 piculs. It was found that Xincheng sold 7,700 piculs, Ruida sold 3,100 piculs, Suilong sold 2,100 piculs, Dachang sold 2,400 piculs, and Changhe sold 2,300 piculs. Gengfeng bought 5,300 piculs, Rongxing bought 1,700 piculs, Jifeng bought 1,200 piculs, Ruiyuan bought 1,600 piculs, and Tonghe bought 1,100 piculs. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>▲ Cotton Demand Sluggish: Spot cotton trading is still flat, and the factories' intention to buy is still slow, it is said.</p>
<p>Tianjin Coarse Cotton: 29.00 yuan, Yongyu Factory bought 100 pieces, sent to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton weakened due to the sluggishness of Wall Street, reverse selling, and long positions being closed. Futures fell by 16 to 19 points, and spot fell by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 23 points, and spot rose by 21 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 30 points. Indian cotton market was closed.

<p>New York, July 7th: The first US cotton field report will be released by the Department of Agriculture on August 8th. Based on estimates from various private sources, the forecast for production conditions is 74.4%, and the cotton field area is 37,852,000 acres.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Tianjin Cotton Market Trends Hard <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>(July 5th Tianjin News): The Xihua cotton market is trending firm. Cotton merchants were calling for 25 taels in the morning, but after several negotiations, they did not come close. Finally, they made the transaction at the previous price. Sanchang bought 265 bales, opening at 23 taels. Da Shangwu bought 80 bales, opening at 22.5 taels. The market trend of Xihua American cotton reveals a flat hardness. The factories' intention to buy is more relaxed than before. Huaxin Factory bought 382 bales, opening at 26 taels. The Shanghai merchants bought a little of the Northern River Long Cotton yesterday, and the market maintained a draw. Qiji bought 50 bales, opening at 26 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Food: Rice Price Continues to Fall by 0.03 to 0.04 Yuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>▲ In the rice market south of Shanghai yesterday, the number of arrivals from various gangs was about 30. The storage in Pudong gradually increased. Due to the weather turning hot, the storage of goods in urban and rural stores slightly decreased. Also, because of the blockade of foreign rice, people were more weak. The price of thick japonica rice started to fall, a decrease of 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Although thin indica rice was sporadically traded, sales were slow, and the price also decreased by 0.02 yuan. Both Luzhou and Yangjian rice were quiet, and the market was weak.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: Yesterday, over 20 ships arrived, mostly Jiangyin, Kunshan rice, and Fenglian gang rice. The appetite of this street is becoming more sluggish day by day, and the price of thick and thin japonica rice weakened by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. There were few Luzhou and Dujian goods, and the prices did not rise or fall. Although there were not many Bianyuan arrivals, sales were sluggish, and the price was also reduced. The demand for foreign rice was motionless, and this street was also small, causing the price to continue to weaken.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Changjiang Gang: Trial of Small Polished Rice <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲ Price Slightly Lowered by 0.015 Yuan, Then Customers Inquired</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market continued to be weak, mainly because the existing stock was sufficient, and sales were flat. The future arrivals will arrive, and people are looking down on the price. All rice weakened slightly after the opening in the morning. Small polished rice had a large existing stock, so the price continued to lower by 0.015 yuan. After the price fell, the Changjiang area inquired quite a bit. It is estimated that Jiangbei Zhenjiang Hankou and other places each purchased over 500 bags of small polished rice. This street continued to inquire, but the number of purchases was also small. In total, over 2,000 bags of small polished rice were sold, priced from 9.62 to 9.4 yuan. 100 bags of Saigon Number One were sold, priced at 11.13 yuan. 400 bags of Red Large Polished rice were sold, priced at 9.03 yuan. There were no other transactions. The market remained weak, and it needs to wait for the consumption of large gangs to have vitality.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Starch: Price Decline Still Small <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market generally showed a flat and weak trend in each month after opening in the morning and afternoon. Foreign wheat quotes returned to a small 0.01 to 0.03 yuan, and the market was mostly wait-and-see. The North region's actual sales requested a lower price to purchase flour that was both domestic and foreign, not caring about other factors. Therefore, once foreign flour was priced cheaply, they immediately placed large orders; otherwise, they asked the Shanghai factory to add to them, so the situation has been different from past sales and demand has changed drastically. After foreign factory futures were again ordered, purchase intentions were interrupted and sales intentions were restricted to small and midsize manufacturers who were looking to release small quantities, whereas the large factories wanted to see high prices and weren't willing to release quantities. Because of this, declines were small. Ultimately, this month was down small five cents compared to the previous day, August was down small 0.075 cents, September was down small 0.05 cents, and October to December was down small 0.025 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Grain Futures: Weak <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the Grain Futures Market yesterday, the months were generally flat and tired. The quoted prices for foreign wheat decreased slightly by 0.01 to 0.03 yuan. Domestic buyers were selling short because the spot wheat market was more favorable than the standard price. As a result, the factories had no interest in buying, and the number of hidden purchases was small. The opening prices of each month tended to be flat. As a result, this month was down 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day, August was down 0.01 yuan, September was unchanged, October was down 0.01 yuan, and November was down 0.03 yuan. Spot wheat's market was still good for the factories, the removal channels were active, and the price was stable. Wuxi wheat was priced at 2.92 yuan, Bahe Lane Taicang wheat was priced at 2.78 yuan, and Penglai wheat was priced at 2.87 yuan, to 0.083 yuan, a total of 2,280 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Silk and Tea: Foreign Dealers' Silk Sales Still Show No Progress <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign dealers' silk market in this city still showed no progress. Due to the sluggish sales of Chinese silk in the United States, the French dealers are still thinking of hoarding at low prices. The interest of silk shops to buy has also decreased, and the market is depressed. Yesterday, only Meiya and other silk factories bought 15 bales of Shanghai white silk factory for top-grade B-grade silk with 20 to 22 filaments, priced at 495 taels, and Dachang bought 10 bales of Sichuan yellow silk factory for wooden machine top-grade silk with 13 to 15 filaments, priced at 520 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Shaoxing Summer Cocoons Have an Extremely High Waste Rate <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲ An average of 350 catties of fresh cocoons are needed to produce 100 catties of dried cocoons: Due to the poor spring cocoon harvest and extremely low cocoon prices this year, farmers in various cities and villages in Shaoxing suffered significant losses. Therefore, few people raised summer silkworms. Only those with mulberry leaves at home reduced the amount of silkworm eggs they hatched. However, the weather was terrible, no different from the spring silkworm season. Continuous moldy rain and abnormal temperatures caused many silkworm ants to be abandoned. The cocoon production only reached 20% of previous years, and the cocoons were damp, with mostly thin-skinned and double-shelled cocoons. The waste rate was extremely high. Because the villagers had nowhere to sell their cocoons, they mostly dried and reeled them themselves. It is said that the average waste rate is 350 catties of fresh cocoons to produce 100 catties of dried cocoons.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Pulled-Core Fine Eyebrow Tea: Active Sales in England <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jinlong foreign firm of British firms was actively purchasing pulled-core fine eyebrow tea from Xixian and Suian districts. However, the asking price was around 120 taels, which Chinese tea merchants considered too low. The market for common fine eyebrow tea in Tunxi remained sluggish. The market conditions for other fine teas and Ping Shui Da Bang tea were also quiet. However, the French firms were sparing no effort in searching for needle eyebrow and show eyebrow tea, and the market price had a large rising trend, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Wuxun Tea Market Falls into the Same Predicament <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>▲Wuyuan: Wuyuan's Zi tea production, with its tender and delicate leaves, was superior to previous years. The tea merchants also considered the quality to be excellent and worth acquiring. They eagerly searched for and purchased the tea, driving the price from thirty-five yuan to fifty-two yuan. At that time, demand was high, and supply was plentiful. However, the good market lasted for less than two weeks, and the downturn in the Shanghai market never ceased. Various tea companies transported large quantities of Zhenmei and Huase boxed tea, accumulating to a massive ten thousand boxes. Occasional transactions were negotiated, but prices were halved compared to the previous year. When combined with costs, many deals resulted in losses. Therefore, tea merchants saw no hope for a turnaround in the tea market and were hesitant to invest in this Zhen tea. Mountain households, due to low closing prices, also stopped picking tea one after another. Yesterday, the price of new tea from the Beiyuan tea mountains plummeted to forty yuan, following the market's collapse. Tea companies with smaller purchases have gradually closed their operations in recent days, and the market situation is rapidly deteriorating.</p>
<p>▲Tunxi: Due to the Shanghai market's continued decline, Tunxi tea companies have mostly ceased purchasing tea. Previously, various tea merchants, anticipating growing demand from tea companies, transported twice as much new tea as before, accumulating to a massive ten thousand dan. Currently, high-quality Zhuang tea is priced at fifty yuan, medium-quality at forty yuan, and low-quality at just over twenty yuan. However, tea companies are finding it difficult to sell, so despite the loose prices at the warehouses, they dare not purchase any more. Even the tea sellers in flourishing shops with the highest quality goods, are seeing their wares pile up and are seeing prices fall back to twenty-four yuan, as buyers are already sated. The market is becoming increasingly bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Piece Goods: Hat Felt Sales are Brisk <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Hat flannel has been selling very well recently. All hat workshops in this city are purchasing it, with both whole boxes and individual pieces being sold. However, most transactions involve issuing invoices with a one-month clearing deadline. Hat flannels priced at around two or three taels are particularly popular, as there is very little stock available and no new supplies are arriving, leading to shortages and higher demand. The price of domestic Zhanghua hat flannel has risen from three taels to over four taels, and transactions have been made at these prices, although in small quantities. This is due to the color and pattern.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Hardware: Thin Galvanized Iron Sales are Good <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Thin galvanized iron has been selling very well recently, with demand from various regions, including the Yangtze River inland areas and Fujian. The standard is slightly higher than before, with 3'x7' sheets selling for 900 cash each, and 3'x6' sheets for 780 cash (for standard grade goods). Inferior brands are cheaper, with 3'x7' sheets selling for 860 cash and 3'x6' sheets for 750 cash. Six to seven hundred dan were sold yesterday. However, foreign firms have also been releasing their existing stock in recent days, so there is no concern about stockouts in the market.</p>

<p>Lower-grade white coal and small-sized coal are in high demand from laundries and coppersmiths in this city. Existing stock on the market is very scarce, leading to soaring prices. The price per ton is even exceeding that of lump coal. In the market, one hundred tons of Hongqi lower-grade coal were sold at sixteen taels, eighty tons of small-sized coal at nineteen taels, one hundred and fourteen tons of Mark lower-grade coal at twelve taels and five mace, forty-five tons of small-sized coal at fifteen taels and seven mace and five li, sixty tons of Shanxi lower-grade coal at ten taels and five mace, and seventy-five tons of Liujiang lower-grade coal at seven taels.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Japanese Foreign Vice Minister's Gaffe <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 6th: Japanese Foreign Vice Minister Arita, stated to the British ambassador the other day that the Japanese government would not unilaterally recognize Manchukuo before the Lytton Commission returned to Geneva to report. This matter was discovered by the Japanese warlords, who were greatly angered and attacked him vehemently, making it difficult for him to keep his position. This statement, in normal eyes, was not a mistake or even a simple fact, but in the eyes of the Japanese warlords, it was a great loss of face. Because in the eyes of the Japanese warlords, the League of Nations was not important. They were constantly talking about withdrawing from the League of Nations, but now Arita said that he would not unilaterally recognize it before the Lytton report, which made it clear that the Japanese still had some misgivings about the League of Nations. It was indeed a slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>If that's the case, then diplomats can never tell the truth. It's the golden rule of diplomats. I don't mean to praise the effectiveness of our diplomats. No matter how diplomatically unsuccessful they are, the people will repeatedly ask them to reveal the truth and policy of diplomacy. They always refuse to change their tune, and their official responses are all about victory and success. They never say a word of truth. So, after repeated negotiations, victory always belongs to us. This is a proud situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only our diplomats are like this, but also every politician. Generally, once they become officials, they never tell the truth. Today a speech, tomorrow a declaration, are all described vividly, but the result is a slippery check. Now it has become even more advanced. The so-called speeches do not necessarily require people to ask about them. A speech-style news report is already taken out of their pockets. This is a convenient and time-saving thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, our country is completely a diplomatic country. No matter what happens, it is not easy for the people to know the truth. This is probably still the mental method passed down by Confucius: the people can be made to follow it, but they cannot be made to understand it.</p>

<p>Swallows sing and orioles warble. In the clear day, the curtain is rolled up. The red pavilion is weary of embroidery. The clouds and duckweed drift to the horizon. Who cares about people's sorrow? Gazing wistfully at the beginning of spring, until the end of spring, I vainly shed tears on the red mud. Truly, my longing is enough.</p>

<p>Gazing wistfully at Jiangnan, the misty rain is still the same. Fallen flowers have no owner. Who is living in the deep courtyard? No one is seen. It deceived the parrot in front of the curtain. The pavilions and terraces of last year have been replaced by red dust and yellow earth. Lonely tides return to the Jiangpu. The mountains are cut off and clouds will fill the gap. Catkins gather into balls, and the sky is getting late. I am afraid to speak of the wind's madness like a tiger. Let's not talk about the many rises and falls, and the singing and dancing in the red buildings.</p>

<p>The river waves sway with green and the peaks lie horizontally with emerald. I am afraid to bring up sad things. A glance reveals a strange landscape. Cuckoos sing and orioles trill. Willows sleep and flowers slumber. They are all tears of longing. This catastrophe has come for no reason. It seems that this Jiangshan has been overrun by Hu cavalry. Fragrant grass and setting sun, spring is leaving. The bells in the empty temple easily sound and the tides scold like reproaches. The poet is determined to be drunk.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Lithographic Printing <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Er</p>
<p>The art of lithographic printing was invented by the German, Senefelder, in 1799. This lithographic stone contains the main component of calcium carbonate, which is different from ordinary lithographic stone. The surface of the lithographic stone is very smooth, and its texture is composed of fine particles, with very small holes in between. The function is to absorb moisture. These small holes cannot be seen with the naked eye without a microscope. The source of lithographic stone is in Solnhofen, Germany. Before it was discovered that this stone could be used for printing, it was completely used for paving roads. After knowing the function of this stone, the area, which was originally a barren area, has been transformed into a wealthy area, and the area can also be called the only place in the world that produces lithographic stone.</p>
<p>The area of ​​lithographic stone commonly used is rectangular, with a thickness of about three or four inches. In addition to being able to absorb moisture, the ingredients in the lithographic stone can be combined with fatty soaps. Once combined, it can absorb ink. If Arabic gum is applied to the stone surface, it cannot absorb oil. Therefore, if you want to print multi-color pictures, in addition to coloring, the blank areas are subjected to the chemical action of this gum, and the ink can be removed, and the printing can be satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the printing method, text or other patterns are written on tracing paper with fatty ink (tracing paper is not the commonly used blue tracing paper, but a transparent tracing paper similar to the original paper). It is placed upside down on the lithographic stone, and after moistening it with a damp cloth, the machine is turned to press it, and the text appears on the lithographic stone. Then remove the paper, and after slightly modifying the printed words, the object can be printed, or the fatty ink can be directly written on the stone surface. However, this is more difficult, because writing upside down is not as satisfactory as writing on tracing paper and pressing it on the lithographic stone.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two printing methods, it can also be printed as a lithograph in this way. After moistening the picture with water, a zinc plate coated with chromium photosensitive material is placed and put it in a filter and exposed to sunlight for ten minutes. After it is photosensitive, take out the zinc plate, roll the entire plate with an ink roller, bake it slightly on the fire, and then wash it lightly with thin cotton dipped in clean water. Then, the unexposed chromium colloids are dissolved by water together with the ink oil, and the exposed text or image part can resist moisture and absorb ink oil. The shadow remains on the zinc plate, and there is no danger of shadow loss. Then, cover it with tracing paper and roll it with an ink oil roller, and sprinkle rosin powder, plus a liquid made of nitric acid and agar. This is to prevent its fatty lines from becoming thick and green, and it can be printed out.</p>
<p>The printing method has been described above. After use, the ink marks on the lithographic stone cannot be removed. To remove them, you can wipe them with turpentine or pumice powder. The printing color can be from one color to more than ten colors.</p>
<h3 id="e203">A Brilliant Female Physiognomist <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Flood</p>
<p>A section chief from the XX Department came to Shanghai specifically to see the devastation after the war. He was staying in a very beautiful room at Yipinxiang. I went to visit him around 7 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"Are you busy tonight? If you are busy, then tomorrow..." After a few polite greetings, he said this.</p>
<p>"After a long separation, we should talk more even if we are busy, let alone if we are not." Although I agreed to him in this way, I always felt that his somewhat abrupt question was a polite request for me to leave.</p>
<p>"Sir! The physiognomists are here!" The waiter suddenly pushed the door in and said with a joyful smile, as if he was reporting good news.</p>
<p>"This! Uh! Please let them in!" Then he turned his head and said to me, "It's nothing, I just asked some physiognomists to come and have some fun!"</p>
<p>A crisp sound of leather shoes sounded. Good heavens! It turned out to be two fairy-like modern girls! Where were the prophets with tall crowns and wide belts that I had expected? Their faces were covered with lead powder and rouge, thick lipstick was applied to their lips, and the rose essence sprinkled on their heads dripped down, instantly filling the room with fragrance. Their gossamer-like gauze faintly revealed their delicate, tender white breasts, soft, flexible bellies, and coy buttocks. I had already very sensibly moved to sit on the edge of the bed, so that they could get closer to tell fortunes.</p>
<p>"Sir! You really have a good face! Your forehead is full, your jaw is square, and your nose..." One of the fatter girls said, moving her two small, bright red lips as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Your dragon and tiger are in proportion, your palms are as soft as cotton, and plus this red seal and the straight life line, it indicates that you will be rich and noble..." Another palm reader said. She was slender and always had a gentle smile on her face.</p>
<p>Although they read faces and palms differently, their expressions were almost the same. For example, they talked while smiling, and they pointed while talking! That is, they were touching. The beauty of their whole secret and magic, all in these small, clever movements, smiles, faces, and a different scene appeared on the twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>As an outsider, although I appeared very generous in listening to their high-level instructions, the fear in my heart was beating faster and faster; not to mention him who let them touch his fingers and face, even if he were a clay sculpture or a wooden carving, he would inevitably be charmed. And in fact, he was always staring at them with rapt attention, and it seemed that he was telling their fortunes. Later, they even stopped speaking, and only six eyes looked at each other silently!</p>
<p>"Ahem!" I coughed, clearing my throat, breaking the silence and tension that had lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" He smiled and gave each of them ten yuan!</p>
<p>"Thank you! Sir, you are so kind!" They left the room in a victorious manner. Then I asked him how he knew these two brilliant female physiognomists as soon as he got off the bus. He gave me a colorful advertisement. What caught my eye were the two girls' animated photos, with the words:</p>
<p>Ms. XX and Ms. XX are the most famous female physiognomists in Shanghai! If you want to invite them to come and tell your fortune, whether it is in a hotel, restaurant, brothel, wine shop, or any public place, send an invitation and they will come. If you are afraid of being delayed, call us. If you favor us with your presence, you are especially welcome. We have a quiet fortune-telling room for your private conversation! The fortune-telling fee is two yuan, and there is no extra charge for going out. Phone number XX, XX Hotel.</p>

<p>On every relatively busy pedestrian street, there are ice cream stalls. It is said that the health bureau is trying its best to ban these unhygienic seasonal foods, but as long as you donate a letter, you can shout and sell loudly, which is not contradictory to the ambulance with the Red Cross giving vaccinations everywhere.</p>

<p>"Another 50% off! Eliminate enemy goods! Relieve silk!" The newspaper published such a big advertisement; although it was declared to be enemy goods, the butterfly-like girls returned with large bags and small bags. Cheap goods are always attractive to everyone.</p>

<p>The night in the French Park is full of seduction. Many poets and novelists use its background as the moment when the protagonists in their books complete a kiss.</p>
<p>Mysterious night, especially summer night. The cool breeze gathers through the gaps in the trees. Under the faint light, the fragrant traces of ladies are everywhere. In the darkness, many evils occur. Temporary revelry, lifetime regret!</p>

<p>Stepping on the North Sichuan Road Bridge, the scars of the war cannot cover the sadness in my heart, but if you walk slowly, the music in the silver cafe, the temptation of the flesh, and the stimulation of alcohol, have made you forget in your drunken heart that this is a mysterious street that has been ravaged by imperialism.</p>
