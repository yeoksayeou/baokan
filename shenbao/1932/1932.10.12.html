<p>時評</p>
<h3>論節約運動·都·良</h3>
<p>軍事委員會蔣員長。曾於上月之杪。發乞賬通電。掦諸報端。其於匪區之摧毀情狀。遺黎之箥蕩無依。往復述詞旨悽愴。即遠隔千里未經身歷之吾人。攬茲一紙電文。亦且爲之旁皇惻怛不能畢其辭。較之通常捷電。意義奚啻倍蓰。抑其末段所陳。更有觸廢吾人無限感慨者。梗骨之喉。久思傾吐。輒藉時便。一抒述之。</p>
<p>「····軍興以來不惟變辭劇于曩時。即淸約亦遜于往日。都市則奢華愈甚。農村則疾苦愈深。長此推移。日加耗糜。縱無外患。寗免淪亡。全國上下。怵茲慘狀。共尙惇樸。力矯奢華。」</p>
<p>右爲蔣電末段之大旨。吾人今試放眼以觀社會之現狀。個人奢侈慾之澎漲。果已提高到如何程度乎。海外消耗品之輸入。果已增進到如何數量乎。恐雖昩察之士。亦知其有驚人之發展也。顧另一方面所啓示者又如何。生產落後。市場黯淡。敎育停滯。實業廢弛。社會經濟。陷於崩潰。在在爲不可掩蔽之事實也。以如此錯綜盤互之因素。以形成畸偏發達之局面。相激相盪。相薄以趨。夫幾何而不措國本于積弱之途國難已作覆巢是懼而幕上之燕。猶復酣歌恒舞窮日卜夜。曾来稍戢其奢靡耽樂之念。則心死之哀。誠有不能言不忍道者矣。</p>
<p>奢靡習尙之構成。由于環境所創造者半。由于人性失其控制者半。就國内現勢言。不惟豪門權閥。好爲窮奢極侈也。即中流階級。亦儘多縱情浪擲。莫知自反者矣。不惟都市大邑。有此頽靡之風紀也。即腹地僻壤。亦有漸改移其樸僿之氣象者矣。風會所趨。貽害之烈。有遠非吾人意計所及者。今試論之。常人俸給所入。未嘗不足以贍家室也。奢風之所漸染。稍與酬答。立形拮据。拮据之結果。則困心衡慮。日惟改進現狀之是圖。于是而工作效率减。業務進行滯矣。厭原來之職守。思倖于一時。懸鵠而赴。不擇手段。或以投機爲致富之捷徑。或以仕宦爲起家之利藪。手于是而商業失其健全。政局無法澄淸矣。宦途得志。奢望逾增。倚權勢爲憑藉。即無事不可爲。於是而下民遭誅求之累。閭閻乏寗靜之日矣桀黠之夫。流爲穿窬。非關饑寒之迫身。乃由紛華之招誘。踰閑潰决。悍圖一逞。於是而社會秩序爲其破壞矣。鄕里謹愿之士。平日唯知矻矻於工作。徒見獵兮心喜。遂相率而思遷。都會中多一批游離待插之人。即地方上减一分切實生產之力於是而田園有荒蕪之虞。山林阻生長之機矣。凡此種種。胥由奢靡習尙所釀成。而其極也且將使整個國運。入於莫可挽復之刦數。疑駭雜象。旣已紛呈。國人而猶有一分愛國之心者。則改絃易轍。正本淸源。應自力戒奢靡始。政府當局而眞有振作精神刷新政治之心者。則改良社會。以返於誠樸之風尙。必自當局先能以身作則力戒奢靡始。</p>
<p>日昨京電所傳。有建議組節約會者。此即所謂共循之軌也。法簡意良。人得起而行之。無需時之準備。無咨商之必要。直接得以裕國家之經濟。間接亦爲地方培元。氣上行下。效勵相匡飭。以集節約運動之大。成一轉移間而風氣丕變。夫豈甚難之事乎。其猶以此爲老生迂談而目笑存之者。斯則非吾所欲喻矣。</p>

<h3>前淸人口報告虚增虚減</h3>
<p>— ·景·記</p>
<p>相老人有時談到現在政界的黑幕·固然認爲要改良：不過也說，比前淸的吏治，有些情况，似乎進步！我且記幾件事。</p>
<p>一·相老人談：在山東　口機器局的時候，當然本地的貢桃，承地方官的盛意，也分送了兩隻桃子·你想：進貢一次。皇帝所得無幾，王爺要一份，督撫要一份：這個那個，不知若干！他初得了僅分送來兩隻桃子，很覺得那人情似乎太薄，幸巧遇着一位識貨的同事，敎會他如何吃法：他吃到一隻桃的半個多，就覺得太甜了不能再往下嚥了，那時候，我們聽相老人談故事的，覺得手裏的龍華桃，盤内的奉化桃，都没有了多大滋味了！因爲那時大家正吃桃，相老人纔談到桃呢！</p>
<p>二，相老人又談·當時報告上峯，說火藥原料多少錢一斤：批下來說：這太貴了·於是得想法再報告。一個幕友說，改斤稱磅罷：依樣行事，果然照准。你想：一斤多呢還是一磅多呢？磅是西名：所謂「洋務」，就含糊了事！</p>
<p>三，相老人又談了更有趣的一件，就是每年例行一次報告人丁户口。平常總是加報一點，表示本地方官的政績。一遇荒旱，便事减除若干：預留給將來增加的！虚增虚减，都是官樣文章！</p>
<p>相老人常勸後輩：不要徒慕虚榮：妄想升官發財！</p>
<h3>二十年前的廻憶</h3>
<p>— ·乙·未·生</p>
<p>在二十一年前，民國元年的第一個雙十節那天。大家總還記得那個時候，我們的朝氣蓬勃的景况吧。在上海舉行提燈會慶祝的時候，各界各團體參加的人，十分踴躍。在我們的行列裏頭，參加來了一位金的高麗人。這位金先生，據知道他的人說，他本來是一個受過高等敎育的人，現在却給人家當廚子。他用一面白綢，造了一枝高標，上面綉着大紅色的慶祝的字樣，自己親自掮在肩上，請求以個人資格參加提燈遊行。他在行進中大聲演說他自己亡國的故事，並說中華民國得有今日是如何値得慶幸。他自己是一個亡國遺民，只有望而生慕。他希望中華民國一天强盛一天。則他自己亦覺昨與有榮幸。言下有無窮蘊蓄不盡之意，而且一面說一面擦着眼涙，他自已覺得今天流眼涙是不應該的，便苦笑着自己解釋道：「我是快樂極了流涙呢。」然而行列中和道旁隨行着的觀衆們也有不少陪着他流涙的了。當時我聽了他的話，心裏暗自思　：「我們總有一天能夠挽救他們走出這水深火熱的地獄中吧。這是我們第一個紀念節，也就是我們立己達人的發　，三年五年之後，還怕達不到目的？」我心裡便這樣地私許了他，嘴裏雖未說出。但是，後來是一年一年地過去了，直到現在，已有二十一個年頭，事實似乎一年一年地離開我當時的目的愈遠。那位金先生，現在已不知何在。如果我見了他，將不知用什麽話同他說好。可是，我相信我的目的依然存着。同胞們，一齊來，來創造一個應該要有的光榮的新紀元吧。到那時，不論金先生的存亡，我們可以向他或者他的靈前說道：「金先生，你看，你從此可以不必傷心了！」</p>
<h3>「雙十節」喜劇</h3>
<p>— ·閻·重·樓</p>
<p>記得童年的時候，那一年的雙十節我們是很熱烈的籌備慶典，我們在家裏舉行一個國慶同樂游藝會，招待親友們來參加，父親特爲我們編了一幕喜劇，劇名就是「雙十節」。這劇的大意是|「一個吝嗇的鄕東家在十月十日請他那窮酸的老學究上菜館去吃酒，那兩位先生都是遵守廢曆的，所以他們當然不知道甚麽呌「雙十節」，在吃酒的當兒，他們相約行令，他們的酒令是「誰如果能說一個月日數目相同的節日，就許吃酒。」於是東家先說：「一月一日是元旦，」(吃酒學究說:「二月二日龍抬頭。」（吃酒）東家又說：「三月三日是上己。」（吃酒）學究說：「四月四日···」東家說：「四月四日不是節日，不能吃酒」！接着東家說了「五月五日」（端午）「七月七日（七巧）「九月九日」（重陽）都是節日，學究說了「六月六日」「八月八日」「十月十日」東家說這都不是節日，學究便大嚷起來說：「我還是二月二日吃了酒的呢！他們因此爭閙不已，隔座的人問明他們爭執的原因，都驚訝他們連十月十日是國慶日竟不知道，於是便給他們解釋雙十節的由來和價値，這下他們兩人明白了！纔一致息爭慶祝雙十節。」這一幕喜劇就此告終，在這劇中我扮那窮酸的老學究，滑稽的表演博得闔座的歡笑。</p>
<p>現在時過境遷，祖國的創深痛鉅，雙十節中我們再没有演劇的歡興，我們的心裏只感覺到國難的悲哀！</p>
<h3>國慶小言</h3>
<p>— ·屠·守·拙</p>
<p>歲月不居，已逢雙十，今歲値壬申，武昌起義之歲爲辛亥，民國成立，恰爲二十足年。此雙雙十之國慶，在例應如何舖張揚厲以慶祝之，然而失地猶未收回，仇貨照常充斥，魯難未已，川亂又起，政府財政，旣少辦法，社會道德，更愈墮落，就實際言，弔且不遑，何慶之有？惟失敗爲成功之母，天下事都在人爲，吳諺有云：『不管三七二十一。』今大好之民國二十一年光陰，已在三不管中過去十之八九，往者不諫，來者可追，吾但願從今以後，朝野上下，勿再蹈此泄沓因循之覆轍，一德一心，共赴國難，培養元氣，消弭兵爭，庶幾至第二十二届以及於無盡數届之國慶均得有熱烈慶祝之價値也。</p>
<h3>鐵蹄下的國慶</h3>
<p>— ·介·生</p>
<p>桂兒：今天是十月十日國慶紀念日嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的：爸爸。」</p>
<p>「去···天不早了，把大門關上，搬一張桌子和香爐放到後院裏。」</p>
<p>紀中原愁容滿面，背着手，在黯淡的小房裏走來走去；由他的臉上縐紋和悲鬱的眉稍上，一望而知是沉思在苦惱的深淵裏！</p>
<p>桂兒關上了大門；香爐，桌子，一樣一樣的搬到後院裏放妥紀中原渡進後院，伸出一雙皺手點上一柱香，口裏咕咕喞喞不知祈禱些什麽。</p>
<p>「呵！桂兒：」他怱然有所感動，指着牆角下向他的兒子顫聲說：「把去年埋的那一面國旗掘出來，放在桌上。」</p>
<p>桂兒彎腰掘起一只木盒。打開取出一面靑天白日旗，就着香火的光亮看了看，驚異的喊道：「爸爸：這面旗已經變色了！」</p>
<p>紀中原好像受了地震身不由己樣的震動着；憔悴的面孔，已深埋在熱涙裏了·</p>
<p>轟··轟··轟··拍··拍··拍··怱然一陣槍砲彈的聲音在空中爆發了！四鄕村狗，瘋一樣狂吠起來！桂兒驚慌躱進桌底；紀中原若無其事的仍埋頭祈禱着。</p>
<p>「爸爸：有人··爬··牆了··」桂兒在桌下探出頭來，在這黑夜中似有幾個人影爬進牆來，隠約約聽出沙沙沙的牆土陷落聲，小小的心房忐忑的跳動，由桌底扯扯他的父親衣襟，顫顫的喊呌。</p>
<p>「不許響！」一個穿着武裝，已到了桌前，舉着槍；接連三個，四個·五個·····「你··你··你們··是···」紀中原驚慌到萬分，趕緊把國旗拿到手裹，顫顫的問。</p>
<p>我們是義勇軍：先生，不要怕！大家議定國慶日攻擊，不知道日本鬼子已有準備，幾乎被包圍！不許響··你手裏是什麽？」一個高大人影說。</p>
<p>「呵！壯士們··」紀中原這時高興極了了，低聲說：「這是國旗，靑天白日旗呀！」</p>
<p>「呵！放在桌上，把香火頭熄了！大家跪下紀念祖國吧！」一個佩刀的人影先跪下。桂兒爬出桌底，接過國旗舖平在桌上，大衆一齊跪下。</p>
<p>轟··轟··拍拍拍··四面的槍砲聲仍一陣緊似一陣，傘一樣的紅光，在黝黑的天空中不進的飛舞！他們忘了恐怖和怒濤，忘了自己，忘了一切···在這彈下的深院裹，仍埋頭默默的祈禱着。</p>
<h3>入關郵侶（九）</h3>
<p>— ·求·幸·福·齋·主</p>
<p>這一天，恰又値立秋後第一日。昨天還是那樣的酷熱，自昨晚戍初的時候交了秋，跟着淸晨兩點多鐘下了一塲雨，雨師很冷靜的做了一夜的工作，把最近夏令以來滿地所蒸騰的暑氣，洗刷一空，到拂曉時又是金風乍動，玉露生凉，頓織成一天的秋意。雖然雨是住了，白日仍復朗照在天空，但陽光已不似昨日那樣的炙人，秋風又一陣陣地在到處播散凉氣；僅僅一夜之隔，人世間就不知不覺的已偷換了個凉秋的世界了呢。</p>
<p>引得衆游人在這星期休沐的餘暇，一個個都舒襟開懷，爭來曕賞這萬泉河上第一天所新布的一幕應時的秋景。惟有這一對靑年男女郤非爲賞秋而來；各人心裡，並都還蘊藏着一些昨天積下來的焦躁的餘熱，没感着秋光的暢爽。</p>
<p>魯伯勤苦思了一夜，到晨間便煩不可耐，頭一個先來，在一處要路口上的瓜栅底下，找一個石鼓坐定，抱着頭還在沈吟，藉以等候愛人的芳躅。佟一貞有一點家事糾緾，早餐後又須加一番梳洗和裝飾，自然又來得遲些，直至十點多鐘才匆匆赶到。</p>
<p>當他抬起那發燒般沉重的頭顱，撑起失眠而滯澀的倦眼，諦視到面前這個笑吟吟地玉立亭亭的愛人，頓覺眼界裡閃動流轉着無數道絢爛輝芒的光圈，感受着異常的驚眩，心下是那樣奇異着道：|咦！今天一貞的模樣兒怎麽竟大大的改變了！然而郤又變得太好了·|</p>
<p>原來今天一貞是盛裝而來，香髮經火剪很精緻的燙過，蓬蓬勃勃似堆起一層雲彩。素厭面　　上破例施了些薄薄的脂粉，又添畫了兩道電影明星式的長眉，眉彎微微跳動起來，陪襯這艷麗姿容，眞像一枝活色生香而含苞初放的花朶。身上也完全换了裝朿，另着上一件葱綠色印度綢的旗袍，一雙粉紅絲襪與白礬布高跟皮鞋，並張着一頂湖色的綢傘，處處都顯出華貴的風度，與往日所常見的那種小家碧玉的美貌，又自不同。再加上這花葉繽紛的名園作伊的北背景，益發仙姿秀逸，像是畫圖中的天上安琪兒了。</p>

<h3>雙十節的談話</h3>
<p>— ·佛</p>
<p>前日是雙十節的國慶日，我因爲爛脚，步履維艱，躱在家中，業已多日這個國慶的紀念日，天然享不到一些權利，只有「閉門思過」，整整地靜坐了一天，我想起馬路上的呌喊，「好脚好手天堂路，盲子瞎眼地獄門」今日也總算嘗到了一些風味，幾位脚手輕健的先生們，必定出去逛逛，散散一年來的國氣，或者同朋友谈談「哭笑不得」的國難，或瞎三話四，講講救國的經絡，我想是一般長衫同志酸溜溜的常態麽，</p>
<p>但是國府要人，决不會象我們的寫意，前日中央命令，國慶日照常辦公，停止慶祝，我想國府要人，寫意的時光，着實比我們寫意，不寫意的辰光，着實比我們不寫意，像這樣的國慶日，人家寫寫意意，隨便玩耍，而一般要人們，不但照常工作，而且還要加緊工作，眞是所謂「吃分糧掮管槍」，現在嚴重的國難，壓在頭上，幾位吃政飯的先生們，心裏恐怕也有難過罷，</p>
<p>有兩位老實朋友說，政府的工作，加緊一年餘了，但是尋不出一些工作的好處與成績，國難依舊國難，失地依舊失地，内戰依舊内戰，與其工作而纎毫無補於國難，即僅僅國慶一日，抱煞佛脚，也是無用，樂得快樂一日，充其量也不過死心蹋地，預備去興賞興賞亡國奴的滋味，拆穿西洋鏡，横豎是一個弄不好，再去弄他則甚，</p>
<p>但是我想，一般吃國飯，幹國事，任國責，享國福的先生們，總說不出這樣話，無論若何綆短汲深，一籌莫展，但是一種「失天下之愛而愛，後天下之樂而樂」態度，不可不暴白於天下，好在所謂照常工作，原不過三四五等要人的事，至於頭二等要人，本來無工作可言，</p>
<p>「運命論」原是我們立國的大經，「盡人事以待天命」也是我們做人應取的態度，「人定勝天」之說，本來騙騙人的，國家存亡，原關氣數，幹得好幹不好，原不關我們的事，并且國家存亡，匹夫有責，偌大一個國家，本不是幾個要人所能担負，「衆匹夫」也應該共來負責，</p>
<p>或者謂「平日只許官家放火，不許百姓點燈」，到了大難臨頭，小百姓天然也不能負責，我們本來不懂孫總理所謂「民權」的意義，也不懂得所謂主權在民的意義，我們只曉得日出而作，日入而息，國家的事，與我們發生什麽關係，</p>
<p>以上我與隔壁幾個老婆婆昨日所談的話，拉雜記此，以供本埠之資料，</p>

<h3>感時次杜工部秋興韻</h3>
<p>— ·金·藹·士</p>
<p>蕭蕭落木感秋林，塞北風雲氣象森，危幕燕棲環境險，强鄰虎視設謀陰，鋤奸義奮田横膽，雪恥仇存勾踐心，壯士拚將身許國，征衣滌血滿霜碪，</p>
<p>遙望故都落照斜，胭脂北地尙繁華，將軍醉舞花前蝶，使節空浮海外槎，萬里滄溟成沸鼎，滿城風雨動哀笳，莘莘學子秦庭哭，熱涙徒敎濺浪花，</p>
<p>紅旗報捷久　　　，爭奈沙　得失微，宦海　沉　　　，政　起伏鵲南飛，勢成漢鼎三分定，策建秦書十上違，長使銅駝在荆棘，思歸徒自羨驉肥，</p>
<p>破碎河山刧後棋，可憐焦土有餘悲，血流遍地成渠日，烽舉連天對壘時，一髮千鈞催檄急。孤軍百戰援兵遲，覆巢同懼無完卵，王業偏安具巧思，（却酬）</p>

<h3>怎樣消毒</h3>
<p>— ·可·權</p>
<p>細菌是微生物中的一種，牠的身體很小，非用顯微鏡看牠不見。牠不但有毒，而生殖力又很大，若環境適宜，馬上就能由一個分生到幾千萬個。我們的身體上若寄生有這種細菌，如不趕快醫治，聽其產生毒素，非特不能活命，並且要傳染到别人身上，釀成大疫，這是多麽危險喲。</p>
<p>患傳染病的人，身體各部，旣有細菌寄生在上面，因此從體内排泄的痰，唾，汗，糞等，也往往有細菌在内，如在地上隨意的吐了痰，唾，便變成細塵，吸入他人的肺内；或用手觸病人的汗液後，又拿食物去吃；或所病人的糞，澆到蔬菜上去，日後取爲食料，這細菌都是要傳染的。但細菌旣是這樣容易傳染，所以病人的排泄物，和病人的衣服器具等的細菌都在殺滅，以免傳染，這種殺滅就是呌做消毒。</p>
<p>消毒的方法不一，簡而易行的，約有三種</p>
<p>（一）煑沸消毒|這種消毒的方法，祇要把病人的衣服杯盤等，先放在沸水中，再注入重炭酸鈉少許，然後再煑沸三十分時，就可以取出；費用雖省，效力很大，在消毒法中，最爲相宜。</p>
<p>（二）石炭酸消毒|這種消毒的方法，就是用結晶的石炭酸五分，加熱水九十五分，一同攪拌使溶解後，就變成石炭酸水。再把石炭酸水，灑在病人的房裏，器具，和排泄物上，或把病人的衣服杯盤等物，放在石炭酸水内洗滌，都是可以消毒的。</p>
<p>（三）石灰消毒|這種消毒的方法就是用細碎的石灰粉一分，和水四分，一同攬拌，就變成石灰乳，再將這石灰乳，撒在這病人的糞内和唾内，也是可以消毒的。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>讀新家庭的標準之我見</h3>
<p>— ·王·明·星</p>
<p>昨日淸晨讀申報朱允宗先生之大作，不勝慨係，謹以一斑管見，斗膽輸呈，以供閱者一粲，</p>
<p>夫中國之社會不良，人稱萬惡，其重要原因，愚以爲不在家庭，第一在政府不能使人民安業，解决民生問題，第二人民以個人單位　，良莠不齊，一</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>試觀我國储諸公，高唱訓政高調，除使一般天眞兒童，學得潑婦駡街之大呼，打倒帝國主義··口號以外竟毫未提高全國人民之智識，上無富國强民之大計，又烏論無知之愚民？不惟學府成有產階級之專利，即以入一國民小學，亦非小康之家不辦，且取消私塾，而不能以普遍之農村敎育代之，是非愚貧民之政策而何？在科舉時代尙偶有「街頭乞兒中狀元」之佳話，而所謂打倒階級觀念之民國成立，乞兒得敎育機會，亦竟成不可能之幻夢，欲求改良社會，提高一般平民知識，豈非以方寸之木高於岑樓？求末捨本之策？然此乃國府之大計，非無勢無力之平民如予，所敢妄言者也</p>
<p>三民主義實行五年（？）遑論民權民族未能見効，即以民生論，失業日多，金融緊急，人在窮困顚沛，饖寒交迫之中，未嘗不挺而走險者，挺而走險者日衆，社會萬惡愈甚，此固仍關於國家之急務，與家庭無涉也，故予所謂第二原因，實與第一原因，連續無殊，</p>
<p>至於朱君大作，以新家庭標準爲文題，余以爲大不然，若以專爲富家改良家庭標準，則庶幾可矣，夫人之慾無窮，誰不願高樓大厦？花園汽車，以享人間愉樂，然而都市之地，寸地尺金，欲求一較暢之鴿子籠居屋，尙不可得，又焉能有若朱君之堂皇設計？</p>
<p>然而家擁巨資之富翁，家庭殊無改良之必要，蓋子女入大學，留歐美，存欵累累，儲蓄於外國銀行甚多，飲食合於衛生，等等，應有盡有，無待人言，至於節儉，勢不可能，即人諫勸亦必不能改，反言之，富翁若人人節儉，與商業亦不無影響也，况此輩人在中國，不過僅僅數百萬之一二，即盡從朱君所言，亦不足以改革社會也，</p>
<p>退言之，朱君若以一般家庭論，則今日中國民衆求豐衣足食者，尙不多，况能蓄妾儲婢耶？以中國舊道德論，以目下經濟不景氣論，一夫一妻以及子女外，實有饍養父母之必要，生兒防老之言，固非明訓，然事實上則不得不然也，至於成年兄弟姊妹不同居，不知成年之標準爲何，故不論，儲蓄，保險，爲當今人人皆知，且有衣不能暖食不能飽者，事實上，有能不可能也，職業問題尤爲難解决，僧多粥少之時代，噉飯非易，微薪尙難，所謂直接生利有益羣衆之言，實亦爲暇顧及，家宅離市塲遠，則對於職務諸多不便，非有電話汽車之備，困難亦多，圖書館運動塲，尤非一般家庭中人，所敢企想，餘如婚姻自主，有普通醫識，節省消耗，屏除不良嗜好，則朱君明見處余認爲一般人所應採用者也</p>
<p>朱君列吸烟於不良嗜好，則未敢贊同，余當另日詳論之，</p>
<p>以現今社會光景論，中下階級之家庭·有改建之必要，然多數皆在勉强支持生活中改建，亦力不從心者也，</p>
<p>予以爲其大部份責任應歸政府，唯今之計，以實行孫總理之言，節制人民財產，大資本歸國有，平均地權，子女不得承繼，遺產没收作公共事業，創辦全國農村敎育，遍立公共圖書館運動塲，開發内地，僅此已足，</p>
<p>因此欄爲改良社會討論會，故言多離題，而愚以爲現况下之家庭，無法改良完善，政府不行策，則富户未有肯以全力作公共事者，貧户則尙自顧不暇，且貧户驟富亦必驕奢淫佚，忘其困時，苟安圖逸，亦我民族之弱點，非政府厲行平克改也，</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3>上海華僑多</h3>
<p>— ·征·廔·舊·生</p>
<p>『華僑』這個名詞，多麽値得人們的信仰，的確，這班身處絶域，惓懷故國的僑胞，較之國内醉生夢死的民衆，眞不可同日而語。因此上海的人們，由信仰而形諸文字，商店學校··，都拿『華僑』的名稱來號召，好像記念孫中山先生而出品的中山表，中山筆，中山襪，中山鞋··一樣熱烈。但是我們如果咬文嚼字的解釋，這個|華僑|名詞，覺得用在上海|國内|有些不妥。所謂『華』，是華夏之華，『僑』是寄寓的人，華僑兩字連帶說起來，就是中華之人寄寓在外國的呌『華僑』。就是英美德法的人，寄寓在中國的，我們也稱做英僑美僑··。因此我們認爲凡是寄寓國外的中華人，纔配稱做『華僑』。如果這位華僑已經回到本國，已是華而不僑了，不論他在國内辦了些任何事業，不得以華僑名，何况與華僑絶無關係者。假使這事業確是華僑拿出錢來辦的，而主人翁却仍在國外，那末只能在名稱上面附帶聲明是華僑出資設立的，不能很籠統的直用『華僑』兩字當做名稱，否則就是笑話；』</p>
<p>假使在上海地方有一個『華僑學校』或『華僑商店』的名稱，如果給外僑看了，|也許不一定是外僑|以爲這學校是給華僑子弟讀書的嗎？這商店的基要主顧大都是華僑嗎？這時他們眞要好像到了小呂宋南洋羣島了！</p>
<p>並且我們的上海，在一二八時，總算没有給倭奴奪去，我們何必在自己家裏稱起客人來，雖說『謙讓』是我國人固有的美德，但是這種『反主爲客』的『謙讓』，眞覺太過分了。</p>
<p>不過商店學校拿華僑做名稱的還可，現在北四川中竟有土耳其浴室|神秘的浴室|上面也冠以華僑兩字，成了『華僑土耳其浴室』的名稱，這種疊樑架屋的名稱，不但使人可笑，確是玷汚了華</p>

<p>僑的名譽，無怪僑委會要請市政府設法取締了。（事實見本月十三日本報）唉『上海華僑多』！</p>

<h3>國文課</h3>
<p>— ·惠·農</p>
<p>這大槪是我們貴校特有的良好習慣，在上課時是一點聲息也没以，其實，那裹有這樣靜呢？祗因上課的實在少得可憐，所以就是談話，聲音也並不十分高，但，很奇怪的，上國文課雖然人特别少，談話聲却很高，這時上課鐘已打了，但談話聲却仍不停，反正要是這一課不是國文課，恐怕早已寂靜的：在候着敎員的光顧呢，這時他們和她們還是在高談闊論，不過把談論的問題移而討論着國文敎師罷了。</p>
<p>「這一課又好聽說書了？」坐在第一排的女同學E向S說。</p>
<p>「是呀，一睡期有二次說書聽聽也很好玩呢？」S回答說。</p>
<p>「你看他一会黑得和印度阿三差不多的尊容，講話時一口浦東白，又是指手劃脚的，眞夠人發笑！頑皮的C說。</p>
<p>「我看還是打一回磕睡，」這是大胖子芳的提議。</p>
<p>這時坐在後面的男生也在討論，不，高談闊論着。</p>
<p>「L你今天帶得什麽小說進來？」小黑炭W說。</p>
<p>「我麽？没帶什麽，只一枝自來水筆，和一本信箋。」</p>
<p>「你又預備做你的老功課了麽？但她對你的····」</p>
<p>他們正談到這裹，顧先生|國文敎師|來了，點過名後，就繼續講着「性惡篇，」但，不久大槪他發見了前排的芳在打磕睡，而其他的也在各做他們的特殊工作，於是他就這樣的說：</p>
<p>「諸位，現在我有幾句話要和你們講，就是在課時候請你們别講話，和打磕睡，因爲這是很不··」他說到這裏大家就哄堂大笑，同時，S也已把芳推醒，但，她還在揉着眼睛不懂呢？這時顧先生仍繼續的說：「不過你們要是不願意聽時，儘請看小說，老實說，國文非比英文，一禮拜二小時國文於你們不會有什麽進益···但小說只許看林紓繹的幾種，因爲他的文言文很好，看了或許到有點益處呢！」</p>
<p>「不，顧先生，這幾種恐怕買不到吧？或許這版子已燒去也說不定，」L說</p>
<p>「那麽請你們就媽媽虎虎的看講義吧！」顧先生嘻嘻地說，同時敎室裹有輕微的「老滑頭」底駡聲發出，接着又是一陣哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>黑幕</p>
<h3>舞</h3>
<p>— ·吾</p>
<p>生長在鄕村中的汪小姐今天能夠因一僥倖的機會而參加這華貴的盛會，眞使她驚喜不置。這裏有說不盡的堂皇富麗，玲瓏燦爛的電光，精緻花紋的軟茸茸的地氈，天鵝絨的沙發，醉人的音樂，紳士的夜禮服，太太們的肉香，珍珠的項圈。鑽石的戒指，溫順漂亮的僕歐，列香的香檳，一切都是繁華，一切都是富麗。</p>
<p>這裏是天堂，這裏是皇宮，這裏是她從未夢想過的境地。他想：「我爲什麽能夠跑到這裹來的，這裏對於我是如何生疏啊！」於是她感覺不安，他感覺侷促，一切對她都是不自然。然而她畢竟非常興奮，因爲她反省到自己是十分渺小，而居然能夠參與這種盛會，到底覺得過於榮幸。不過這究竟是一個偶然的機會，假如她不是承一個名人的介紹來到這裹爲一難民子弟學校募捐，她那裏能夠嘗試到這人間天上的陶醉呢？</p>
<p>她坐在這裏被一切繁華所煊惑，一切對她不調和的景物都在她眼前無停止的刺激，加之這一位風流倜儻的名人又十分殷勤的向她勸酒，於是更加怔忡，更加興奮，而且更加恐怖。</p>
<p>一會兒酒席撒去了，換上了彩色的電燈，在幽揚的樂聲中，在肉感的燈光中，只見少女們以及太太們都敞着胸懷，惦着脚尖，一個個偎在男人的懷中合着音樂的節拍跳舞。務軟的腰肢，綿密的情懷。這時候她接觸着這名人貪慾的眼光，他完全和平時學者的風度異樣了。「啊，這是多麽奇怪呀！」她覺得十分可怕甚至於戰慄起來。當然，這學者决不會體貼她處女的心情，一步步的逼近來要求她和他跳舞。他低聲的向她請求。</p>
<p>「小姐！對不起。」</p>
<p>「先生！我不會哩。」</p>
<p>「大家都是自家人，不必客氣。」</p>
<p>「不，我眞不會，我從來没有跳過。」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈，那末我敎你罷。」</p>
<p>她没有方法，他的手已插向她背後來而將她抱在懷裏了。呀！這是一種什麽滋味呀：她那跳躍的心貼在這名人的胸前更加跳得厲害了。然而她還掙扎着說：</p>
<p>「先生，我不是來跳舞的，我到這裏是爲了那許多孤苦舞告的兒童們請命的。」</p>
<p>「是的呀，我何常不知道，可是這時候他們都忙着跳舞擁抱，你向誰募去呢？」</p>
<p>「不過我得等候着，爲了可憐的兒童們我可以忍耐的等候着，等到他們休息的時候。」</p>
<p>「旣是這樣，那末我們又何必不跳舞着等候，趁時快樂快樂呢？」</p>
<p>「不····」</p>
<p>「哎，你旣然到這裏來了，你就不妨盡情的享受這裏的繁華；什麽難民，什麽孤苦無告的兒童，却是的這裏不相干的。靜你將他們忘記了罷，而且親愛的小姐，你知道我是十分愛你的哩！」</p>
<p>這位汪小姐這時默默無言。雖然她不能同意這種解釋，可是她確已給這裹的一切所溶解無遺了，何况自己還在這溫柔體貼的名人的擁抱中。</p>
<p>那末，那些汚穢的兒童們便漸次在她的記憶中褪去了。</p>

        <h1>1932.10.12</h1>
<h3>On the Economy Movement · Du · Liang</h3>
<p>Military Council Chairman Chiang, at the end of last month, issued a telegram appealing for funds, which was published in newspapers. He described the destruction in the bandit areas and the plight of the remaining people who were homeless and destitute. His words were so poignant that even those of us who were far away and had not experienced it personally were deeply moved and unable to finish reading the telegram. Compared to ordinary victory telegrams, its significance was far greater. Moreover, the final paragraph contained remarks that aroused our boundless feelings. I have long wanted to express my opinion, and I take this opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>"… Since the outbreak of the war, not only have the changes been more drastic than in the past, but even frugality has declined compared to earlier times. Cities have become increasingly extravagant, while rural areas have suffered even more. If this continues, the waste will increase day by day. Even without external troubles, can we avoid decline and fall? The whole country, from top to bottom, is alarmed by this dire situation. We must all value simplicity and frugality and strive to correct extravagance."</p>
<p>The above is the gist of the final paragraph of Chiang's telegram. Let us now cast our eyes on the current state of society. To what extent has the individual's desire for luxury expanded? To what extent has the import of foreign consumer goods increased? Even the most oblivious person knows that there has been an alarming development. But what does the other side reveal? Backward production, a gloomy market, stagnant education, and declining industries. Social economy is on the verge of collapse, which is an undeniable fact. With such complex and intertwined factors, a distorted and uneven development has formed. They interact and clash, driving us towards a path of accumulated weakness. National disasters have already occurred, and the nest is in danger of overturning, yet the swallows on the roof still sing and dance day and night. If they do not even slightly restrain their extravagance and hedonism, the sorrow of a dying heart is truly unspeakable and unbearable.</p>
<p>The formation of extravagant habits is due partly to the environment and partly to the loss of control over human nature. Looking at the current situation in the country, it is not only the wealthy and powerful who indulge in extreme extravagance. Even the middle class is mostly indulging in reckless waste, without knowing to reflect on themselves. Not only do cities and towns have this decadent atmosphere, but even remote areas are gradually changing their simple and unsophisticated ways. The trend of the times, and the intensity of the harm it causes, is far beyond what we can imagine. Let us now discuss it. The income of ordinary people is usually sufficient to support their families. However, under the influence of extravagance, even a little social interaction will cause financial difficulties. As a result, they are troubled and worried, and their daily thoughts are focused on improving their current situation. This leads to a decrease in work efficiency and stagnation in business progress. They are tired of their original jobs and think of temporary gains. They set targets and pursue them by any means. Some see speculation as a shortcut to wealth, while others see officialdom as a source of profit for starting a family. As a result, commerce loses its integrity and the political situation cannot be clarified. Once they are successful in their careers, their extravagant desires increase even more. Relying on power, they can do anything. As a result, the people suffer from excessive taxation and the villages lack peace. Cunning people become thieves, not because they are driven by hunger and cold, but because they are lured by extravagance. Once they break the rules, they dare to do anything. As a result, social order is disrupted. Virtuous people in the countryside, who usually only know how to work diligently, become envious of wealth and think of moving to the city. This adds a group of floating, unattached people to the cities and reduces a portion of solid production in the countryside. As a result, there is a risk of farmland being deserted, and the forests are hindered from growing. All of this is caused by extravagant habits, and at its extreme, it will lead the entire national destiny into an irreversible catastrophe. With so many strange and alarming phenomena already appearing, if the people still have a shred of patriotism, they should change course, rectify the source, and start by vigorously restraining extravagance. If the government authorities truly have the will to invigorate the spirit and revitalize politics, they must improve society and return to a sincere and simple ethos, starting with the authorities taking the lead in setting an example and vigorously restraining extravagance.</p>
<p>The news from Beijing yesterday reported a proposal to form a savings association. This is the so-called common path to follow. The method is simple, the idea is good, and people can take action. There is no need for preparation or consultation. It directly contributes to the country's economy and indirectly nurtures the vitality of the local area. Superiors set an example, and subordinates encourage each other. Gathering the strength of the economy movement, one can change the atmosphere in a short time. Is this really a difficult thing? Those who regard this as stale advice and laugh at it are beyond my ability to persuade.</p>

<p>(Hankou) Tang Shizun, commander of the first division of the 21st Army, Wang Zanxu, commander of the second division, and Pan Wenhua, commander of the training division, sent a telegram on the 10th to Qiu Jia, the army's representative in Hankou, detailing the causes of the Sichuan war, stating that the situation has been serious since the 24th Army and the Yang, Li, and Luo troops clashed in the border areas of Shunqing, Yuechi, and Feng'an counties. Deng was induced and coerced by Liu Wenhui for years, angering the Yang, Li, and Luo troops for a long time, hence today's changes. Now, Yang, Li, and Luo are actively preparing for war, while Deng is ostensibly helping, taking the opportunity to leave the province and recruit old troops. Now, on the Shunqing front, we are still trying to quell the fighting, stabilize the situation, and mediate, in order to obey the government and relieve the central government's concerns about the west. Right and wrong will be judged fairly. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government planned to send Dai Chuanxian to Sichuan to mediate the war, but Dai declined. At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 11th, it was decided to have Song Ziwen and He Yingqin consult on candidates for major officials to mediate the Sichuan war. It is reported that Song and He have already consulted once and proposed several people familiar with the situation in Sichuan for detailed discussion. It is rumored that they are considering asking Zhang Qun to take on the role. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although the Sichuan war has been stopped by the central government and appealed to by the whole country, it has finally broken out. According to telegrams from the military bases of the two Lius, the situation in Sichuan is already extremely serious. (1) A telegram from Yichang on the 10th reports that troops have been returning to Sichuan from here for several days. Most of the ships have been used to transport troops, and passenger and freight traffic has been stagnant, causing the market to become sluggish. (2) A telegram from Chongqing on the 10th reports that the air force has been flying to Jiangjin, Yongchuan, Dazu, and other counties for flight training and taking photographs in various places. (3) A telegram from Chengdu on the 10th reports that Tian Songyao spoke to representatives of the academic community, stating that he has telegraphed the central government, vowing to maintain peace and work with Commander Deng to mediate. The chambers of commerce and public organizations in Jiangjin and Yongchuan counties sent telegrams to the general chambers of commerce in Chengdu and Chongqing, stating that military aircraft from Chongqing have been flying over the counties in recent days, and rumors are circulating that they will bomb the cities, causing panic among the people. They requested the authorities to find a way to stop it. Deng Xihou convened a meeting of officers above the rank of colonel in the 28th Army on the 9th, stating that the army will abide by the central government's instructions, maintain peace, and not be tempted by other parties. If necessary, they will send troops to appropriate locations to actually stop the war. (4) Liu Wenhui sent a telegram to the government, the Yuan, and the Military Affairs Committee, stating that on the 2nd, according to a report from Deputy Division Commander Chen Wanren, stationed in Shunqing, the troops of Luo Zezhou and Li Jiayu had been moving towards Shunqing for several days. On the evening of the East, Luo's troops began shooting at the Kang regiment stationed in Lidu, and the shooting continued all night. Further reports indicated that Li Jiayu was advancing with most of his troops, directly approaching the edge of Shunqing City, with about eight regiments of men. At dawn on the 7th, they launched a fierce attack on Shunqing City, while Luo used more than three regiments of troops to coordinate actions in the Lidu area, implementing containment. According to the date, this was after Chairman Chiang's winter telegram to stop the fighting, which shows their unpredictable intentions and complete disregard. It is rumored that they have other support. Liu's defense areas, such as Yongshun, Shunqing, Tongnan, and the counties of Jin and Dazu, adjacent to the 11th Army's sector, have not increased troops or deployed defenses, and have made various war preparations. Liu believed that Chairman Chiang had telegraphed that all troops should remain in their original defense areas and that any small-scale unauthorized movements should be suppressed. Therefore, when Li's troops came to attack, he only ordered his subordinates to engage them within the scope of self-defense. After repelling Li's troops, he ordered them not to pursue them. At the same time, he restrained the troops in Jin, Yong, and Tong to guard their original defense areas. Although Li's troops are still engaged in starting conflicts in the areas of Luxi and Changtai, which belong to Shunqing, and Luo's troops are also in the areas of Feilong and Quanfeng, which belong to Shunqing, Liu's troops are still maintaining calm and awaiting the central government's decision. Luo is stationed in Wusheng and Li is stationed in Yingshan, both several hundred miles away from Liu's defense area. Why did they cross the border and launch an attack directly under Shunqing City? Their willingness to be the ringleader needs no explanation. We beg you to use the authority of the central government to investigate the root cause and give them severe punishment to curb the unrest and maintain discipline. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

At first, the guerrillas were unaware of the dogs' reconnaissance of the guerrillas' movements and suffered some ambushes.

<h3>Military Department Representative Arrives in Yexian for Inspection</h3>
<p>Meets with Liu Zhennian's Representative in Shilibu</p>
<p>There is a Rumor that the Korean Army in Yexian will Withdraw to the Wei River</p>
<p>(Jinan) Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang sent people into the city early on the 10th with letters with the flag, inviting Liu to send important officials out of the city to meet and discuss investigation methods. The location could be either the Sha River or Shilibu, chosen by Liu. The time was also chosen by Liu. At 7 p.m., Liu sent one person with a personal letter and a special envoy back to Sha, stating in the letter that the Chief of Staff Li Henghua would leave the city from the West Gate on the afternoon of the 11th and meet in Shilibu or Youtang, and welcome them to inspect the city. Li Yue said that he would go to Shilibu at that time to meet with Li Henghua and planned to stop entering the city. In the afternoon, Li and Fan went to Shilibu for inspection, but because they were still far from the defense line, they gained nothing. Liu's army fired more than 180 cannons towards the west of the city and more than 170 cannons towards the south of the city on the evening of the 9th. The province's army remained calm and waited on the morning of the 10th. It is said that they did not return fire. Liu's officer, Li Cangui, Han Zilong, and 13 others, defected to the province's army with guns. The province's army gave each person ten yuan and sent them back to their hometown. The entire population of Yexian submitted a petition to Li, Fan, and others, stating Liu's various crimes and hoping that the central government would quickly remove Liu to maintain the country's discipline and rescue the people from fire and water. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Ministry of Communications sent Jiang Kunchi to the Sha River to investigate the murder of Zhang Chengxi, director of the Yexian Telegraph Bureau. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

Director Zhang advocated that Liu must be transferred from Shandong in order to solve the problem thoroughly. After Jiang Bocheng returns to Beijing, there will be a solution. Song will return to Beijing within days. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng ordered someone in Beijing in a morning telegram, saying that Li Yue had met with Liu Zhennian's representative in Shilibu and the results were very good. Li was preparing to enter Yexian City to meet with Liu to discuss ways to resolve the Shandong issue. The Jiaodong issue can be resolved within days. He himself would return to Beijing from Jinan soon, etc. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Yexian Fellow Villagers Association in Qingdao requested the Red Cross to go to rescue the affected people and telegraphed both the Han and Liu armies to ask them to let them pass. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 21st Division's office in Beijing received a telegram from Liu Zhennian on the 10th: (1) Han sent the three brigades of Rong, Zhao, and Chen to attack our Laiyang troops from Hetoudian. After a day and night of bloody battles, they were repelled by us. According to reports, these units are now in Shuizhou Tou and are collaborating with the two thousand troops of the Zhao brigade of the militia, and there is news that they will launch a counterattack on the evening of the 11th. (2) A regiment of Han's cavalry went to Penglai from Fushan City on the 9th, requisitioning grain and extorting money along the way. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu published a letter to the elders of Jiaodong, describing the suffering of Liu Zhennian in the region, stating his unavoidable grief in using troops against Liu. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The National Electricity Workers' Welfare Association telegraphed the Ministry of Communications on the 8th, requesting the Ministry to submit it to the Central National Government Military Committee, stating that Liu Zhennian brutally killed Zhang Chengxi, director of the Yexian Telegraph Bureau, and should be severely investigated to uphold national law, and to order the whole country to provide the most practical protection to transportation and discuss generous compensation. The Ministry of Communications telegraphed the Shandong Administration on the 10th, stating that the murder of Zhang had been reported to the Executive Yuan and urged the Ministry of Military Affairs to investigate strictly. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu told reporters today that the solution to Jiaodong had been generally determined, and he had no preconceived notions and was waiting for the central government to solve it. The central government was currently in communication with Liu. He hoped for a thorough solution to avoid further incidents. He greatly admired Liu Ruuxi's determination in doing things, but his actions exceeded the scope, and he had a responsibility to ask about it. A cook should be in the kitchen and should not run to the secretariat. His move was to relieve the pain of Jiaodong. On the 5th, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang, stating the reasons and the process, and made it clear that there was nothing else. Chiang replied, forgiving him, but considering the international situation, he advocated a quick peaceful solution. Military operations have now been stopped and will not be difficult to end soon. Reports said that he went to the front to direct the attack and that the pistol brigade suffered heavy losses. He returned on the 24th of last month and has not left Jinan a single step. The pistol brigade is stationed in Jinan and has not moved. All of this is unfounded. Li and Fan were ordered by the military department to go to the Sha River yesterday and have now arrived at Shilibu, south of Yexian City, but they cannot enter the city and have only notified Liu to send someone to contact them. The defense lines of the two armies in Laiyang remain the same. Liu commissioned county magistrates to Qixia and Muping to lead the militia to guard the city. A regiment of the cavalry brigade arrived in Yantai today to maintain order. The 64th Brigade's Huang Yurong regiment arrived in Fushan today. At first, he was very worried about the complex Chinese and foreign population in Yantai and Longkou and feared that something would happen, but it has now passed peacefully. However, he has recently felt that his talent is limited and his responsibility is heavy, and that his tolerance is too small. Also, Chiang telegraphed to inquire about the reason for Mr. Feng's departure from Jinan, and he has replied that there was nothing else, only to avoid suspicion. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The people of Weihai, Laiyang, Muping, Haiyang, Wendeng, and Rongcheng telegraphed Han, opposing the transfer of Liu's troops to their respective areas, saying that they were all from Shandong, and what was the difference between love and hate? (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng said that after he came to Jinan, he consulted with Han on the aftermath of Jiaodong with the general's intention, and Han expressed complete obedience. The solution has been largely determined and the aftermath can be completely resolved within a week at most. Because the radio in Yexian City cannot communicate with Nanjing, he has telegraphed Senator Li Ling in Yexian to contact Liu. The general's telegram praised Han greatly. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Yantai) It has been agreed today that Han Fuqu's army will enter Yantai on Friday morning to take over the defense. Liu Zhennian is still surrounded in Yexian. Another brigade of Han's army arrived in Fushan, ten miles west of Yantai, today. Its brigade commander, Ning Shounian (transliteration), has consulted with the naval commander there about the entry of troops into the city on Friday. The Marines who will land to maintain order will be withdrawn to their original ships. Brigade Commander Ning is scheduled to visit the consuls here on Thursday. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Yantai) A telegram from foreigners in Yantai states that the Han army besieging Yexian has withdrawn to the Wei River. Liu Zhennian and his troops are now stationed in a town six miles from Yexian. Two representatives from the Nanjing Ministry of Military Affairs have arrived in Shahe to investigate the truth, but have not yet met with Liu. The priest of an American church in a certain place hastily fled to Yantai at the beginning of the war. After he left, his residence was looted, and the doors, windows, and other items were dismantled by the soldiers as fuel or used to build defenses. The American embassy has lodged an inquiry with the National Government. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Decides to Stop Sichuan Province Warfare</h3>
<p>Orders Liu, Luo, etc., to Return to Their Original Defenses</p>
<p>And Orders Deng, Yang, etc., to Mediate Nearby</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 71st meeting on the 11th. Attendees included He Yingqin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhu Jiahua, Shi Qingyang, Chen Gongbo, Luo Wengan, Song Ziwen, Huang Shaoxiong, and Chen Shaokuan.

At a time when foreign troubles are pressing, all our national troops should unite to resist the enemy. How can we engage in internecine strife, weakening our own strength? The generals and division commanders should immediately order their respective troops to return to their original defenses. If there are unavoidable circumstances, they should report to the central government for handling and should not resort to direct action, increasing the suffering of the people of Sichuan and inviting ridicule from foreign countries. This is of utmost importance. [Executive Yuan Seal] (2) Director Liu of Chongqing, greetings: According to reports, troops under Division Commander Luo Zezhou and Division Commander Li Qixiang have clashed with troops under General Liu Wenhui in the Shunqing and Lidu areas. At a time when foreign troubles are pressing, all our national troops should unite to resist the enemy. How can we engage in internecine strife, weakening our own strength? Even if there are unavoidable circumstances, they should report to the central government for handling and should not resort to direct action. In addition to telegraphing General Liu and Division Commanders Luo and Li to order their respective troops to return to their original defenses, the director should strictly order a stop to the fighting to prevent the disaster of war. [Executive Yuan Seal] (3) General Commander Deng in Chengdu, General Commander Tian, Division Commander Liu in Suiding, and Division Commander Yang in Lin'an, greetings: According to reports, troops under Division Commander Luo and Division Commander Li have clashed with troops under General Liu in areas such as Lidu and Shunqing. At a time when foreign troubles are pressing, all our national troops should unite to resist the enemy. How can we engage in internecine strife, weakening our own strength?

In addition to telegraphing General Liu and Division Commanders Luo and Li to order their respective troops to return to their original defenses, and telegraphing Director Liu Xiang to strictly order a stop to the fighting, the general commanders should mediate nearby to dispel misunderstandings and eliminate the flames of war. [Executive Yuan Seal] (11th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Full Text of the Lytton Report Will Be Released Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Wang's Opinions Have Been Taken to Nanjing by Song</p>
<p>Luo Plans to Go to Wuhan to Seek Jiang's Opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the League of Nations Investigation Commission's report has been printed. It was originally scheduled for release on the 12th, but due to the time it takes for delivery from the Tianjin-Beijing area, it has been rescheduled for simultaneous nationwide release on the 13th. Wang Jingwei's opinions on the Investigation Commission's report have been taken to Nanjing by Song Ziwen. However, Jiang Jieshi's opinions on the matter have not yet arrived in Nanjing. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Jiang, stating that the central government's will is his will, foreign relations are important, and it is necessary to gather the specific opinions of key figures in the central government. It is rumored that Luo Wengan may travel to Wuhan in the next few days to discuss with Jiang, collect the opinions of Wang and Jiang, summarize them into a concrete plan, and then telegraph it to the Chinese delegation so that they can express it at the League of Nations meeting. The Chinese translation of the report was printed in Nanjing and released on the 11th, with 5,000 copies printed. The Western text, with 1,000 copies, was printed in Shanghai and distributed to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai with 200 copies each, and 100 copies were transported to Hankou by plane. It is scheduled to go on sale starting on the 13th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also distribute copies to all members of the Central Executive Committee, Supervisory Committee, government officials, committee members, and heads of ministries and commissions of the various Yuan and ministries for study. (11th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen said that according to the diagnosis issued by the hospital, Wang Jingwei needs three months of rest and may not be able to come to Nanjing recently. Wang is very concerned about the central government's affairs and has made many inquiries. I went to Shanghai to solicit his opinion on the content of the report. He has conducted thorough research and summarized the key points and opinions, instructing me to take them to Nanjing for discussion by the Foreign Affairs Committee. The key issues are, of course, very important. The Foreign Affairs Committee is currently discussing them and soliciting opinions from all parties. After gathering them, there will be a comprehensive proposal, which will be submitted to the central government for final decision and then announced. (11th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that since the League of Nations Investigation Commission has recognized that the Japanese military occupation of the three northeastern provinces is not a legitimate act of self-defense, then the provocation was started by them, and the responsibility lies with them. The League of Nations General Assembly should, based on the report, use effective methods to urge Japan to withdraw its troops and restore the situation before September 18. Since the Investigation Commission has confirmed that the Northeast is Chinese territory, why is there a need for other organizational suggestions? It seems difficult for China to accept this. It is not surprising that Japan is launching a large-scale attack on China. Moreover, the Investigation Commission was appointed by the League of Nations and, of course, has a responsibility to provide faithful advice to the League of Nations. Japan's submission of a written opinion to the League of Nations, arbitrarily rejecting the Investigation Commission's report, has no legal basis in the League of Nations. (11th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) China's opinions on the Lytton Report have been submitted by the Central Political Council to the Foreign Affairs Special Committee for study. The Foreign Affairs Committee has held several consultations, and various committee members have drafted concrete opinions. The discussion is still ongoing. Song Ziwen went to Shanghai to solicit Wang Jingwei's opinions and returned to Nanjing on the 10th, immediately inviting the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for consultation and reporting on his trip to Shanghai. It is rumored that the Foreign Affairs Committee will submit a report to the Central Political Council on the 12th, but a decision on concrete opinions will take time. (10th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the Investigation Commission's report, translated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and printed in 5,000 copies, has now been proofread. Binding was completed on the 11th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will distribute them to all members of the Central Committee and heads of various ministries and commissions as soon as possible for detailed study and will officially release them on the 12th, with each copy selling for 60 cents.

<h3>Guangdong Executive Committee Political Committee Rejects the Lytton Report</h3>

<p>(Guangzhou) The Southwest Political Council has been discussing the Lytton Report for several days and released its opinions tonight, and telegraphed to various locations, stating that the provisions in the report are even worse than the Twenty-One Demands. The proposed solution of allowing the three northeastern provinces to be autonomous is tantamount to allowing Japan to monopolize the area under the guise of international administration. The report is also full of self-contradictions, and its failure to advocate the restoration of the situation before September 18 is a major mistake. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of Sino-foreign cooperation was solely for the purpose of industry and does not believe that it can solve China's political problems. The government and the country should no longer rely on the League of Nations and should quickly gather the nation's strength for a long-term military resistance. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Dr. Philip of Niuzhuang continues to receive letters from his daughter, Mrs. Bowley, dated October 7th, written on thin Chinese paper, describing her unwell condition and stating that she is now suffering from dysentery. She asks for a quick rescue, but requests that no troops be sent, otherwise the bandits will resort to poison. Dr. Philip also received a letter from Kirkland, stating that Mrs. Bowley should leave the bandits' den as soon as possible. Although they still welcome her, the food is poor, and her health is deteriorating, showing signs of illness. Kirkland himself can still endure it and has learned a few sentences of Chinese. Dr. Philip now believes that his daughter's illness is not dysentery, but abdominal pain due to cold. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Panshan to Niuzhuang today claims that a messenger from the bandits' den has arrived in Panshan, reporting that the two kidnapped Britons are being treated well and that the package sent has been received.

A Japanese policeman, accompanied by 30 Chinese guards, left Niuzhuang for Panshan yesterday, intending to directly contact the bandits to negotiate the ransom. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Covets Timor Island</h3>
<p>Portugal Denies Concession</p>
<p>Britain and Australia Already Greatly Uneasy</p>
<p>▲Reuters Lisbon, 11th - The Portuguese Foreign Ministry today denied reports that Portugal intends to cede Timor Island to Japan. Timor is one of the islands in the Malay Archipelago, at the eastern end of the Sunda Islands chain, separated from Australia by the Timor Sea. The southern part of the island belongs to the Netherlands, while the northeastern part belongs to Portugal. Its south side is close to Australia. If the island were ceded to Japan, Australia would be uneasy.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency Lisbon, 10th - Portuguese officials neither confirm nor deny the shocking news that Japan has already purchased the Lesser Sunda Islands (within the South Seas Islands), the largest of which is the Portuguese-held part of Timor Island. This island is only 500 miles from the Australian continent, so this news has greatly shocked Britain and Australia. British newspapers report that the Australian government is now planning to deploy a large defensive force to Darwin Harbour and will close the port as a naval aircraft base.</p>

<h3>Japan's Strategy Towards the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Intended to Delay Review of the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>Aligning with Russia and Withdrawing from the League are All Diplomatic Tactics</p>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency Tokyo, 11th - Japan's strategy towards the League of Nations appears very strong on the surface, and it frequently disseminates pro-Russian sentiment to intimidate the League. However, with France behind it, Japan dares not actually take such actions. This is well-known to all countries. Recently, Japan has once again threatened to withdraw from the League, a familiar tactic, in order to make the League quietly observe for two or three years and allow it to make its own decision. The rhetoric of withdrawing from the League and aligning with Russia are all tricks to achieve this strategy.</p>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency Tokyo, 11th - After the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that it would not recognize the League of Nations Special Assembly to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, and only sent non-official representatives to participate in the assembly to explain Japan's position. Foreign Minister Uchida then changed his policy, and appointed Matsuoka, Yoshida, and Matsudaira as official representatives, recognizing the assembly and preparing to fight a decisive battle with the League of Nations Assembly. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' attitude has changed so much in just half a year, which is truly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Outline of Opinion Paper Completed</h3>
<p>▲Hualian News Agency Tokyo, 11th - The outline of the opinion paper drafted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been completed and submitted to the Army and Navy for review today. A joint meeting of the three ministries will be held again tomorrow to make a decision. The content is divided into six chapters: (1) Japan's position in Manchuria and Mongolia, (2) China's anti-Japanese history, (3) China's internal strife, (4) the Manchurian independence movement, (5) rejecting interference from third countries, and (6) denying the Lytton report's right of proposal. It is over fifty pages long. Detailed content will be described separately.</p>
<h3>Saito Receives Threatening Letter</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency Tokyo, 11th - Prime Minister Saito was preparing to go to his old hometown of Mizusawa Town in Iwate Prefecture tonight, but received a threatening letter signed "Sangū Naval Reserve Blood Corps." The Metropolitan Police Department and the Military Police Headquarters have begun investigations.</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Japanese Cabinet and the Budget</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency Tokyo, 10th - The budget for the coming year, with new requests amounting to 1.2 billion, is extremely relevant to the fate of the cabinet. The military insists on using tax capacity as the standard, with a limited-time tax increase. Finance Minister Takahashi, while expressing that he could consider raising postal rates and luxury taxes, as well as income taxes, is hesitant, believing that this would weaken production capacity. The Minseito party is taking a supportive attitude towards the government under the banner of national principles. The Seiyukai party is adopting a strictly critical attitude, so the future of the issue is fraught with difficulties. However, after the release of the Lytton Report, the national tension towards the League of Nations has led to a tendency to eliminate disputes between domestic political parties and factions. Therefore, although there will be disputes in the budget deliberation, the Manchurian Incident expenses and general military expenses will be deliberated separately to ensure their establishment. The elder statesmen and Privy Council are fundamentally in agreement on this policy. While issuing a large amount of deficit public bonds, they will also implement some degree of tax increase to make the budget suitable, so that the government can devote all its efforts to dealing with the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bank Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>▲Reuters Tokyo, 11th - It was learned today that the three young communists who robbed a bank in Tokyo a few days ago did so on the orders of their party to obtain funds for carrying out a red movement. All three have been arrested by the police. Twelve others related to the case were also arrested yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Third International Strives for Overseas Revolution</h3>
<p>With Particular Emphasis on Japan, India, Britain, and Germany</p>
<p>▲Reuters Riga, 9th - The Executive Committee of the Third International recently held a secret meeting in Moscow. It is reported that it has decided to strive for overseas revolutionary movements, with particular emphasis on Japan, India, Britain, and Germany, believing that these countries have recently become more vulnerable to attack. The meeting advocated promoting the independence of Ireland and other autonomous regions from Britain, inciting Indian farmers to stop paying taxes, and promoting strikes in Britain and India. In Japan, it will reorganize Japanese mass organizations, train them to resist the authorities by force, and in China, it will use more resolute methods to incite elements within China who do not support the central government to expand the civil war and overthrow the Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Important Developments in Disarmament Issues</h3>
<p>US Representative Holds Friendly Consultations with British Prime Minister</p>
<p>Herriot Takes New Plan to London Today</p>
<p>▲Reuters London, 10th - There will be rapid developments in disarmament issues this week. Former US representative Davis, who represented the United States in the preliminary discussions at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, is scheduled to meet with his government officials and economic experts tomorrow to discuss everything. Davis has a dual mission: one is to prepare for US participation in the World Economic Conference, and the other is to integrate President Hoover's proposal with the British government's disarmament program. Regarding the first mission, Davis will first meet with British prominent banker Layton. The private talks between the British, French, and US prime ministers in London later will likely not include Davis.</p>
<p>▲Reuters London, 11th - US Representative Davis met with British Prime Minister MacDonald at 10 Downing Street today and discussed the differences between the British and President Hoover's disarmament plans in a spirit of friendship, aiming to merge the two plans into one. It is believed that Davis's and another US representative, Naval Minister Hepburn, arrival in London can assist in the four-power conference. French Prime Minister Herriot will also arrive in London on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency London, 10th - According to official sources, French Prime Minister Herriot has decided to leave Paris on Wednesday evening and is expected to arrive in London around Thursday or Friday to meet with the British Prime Minister to discuss the preconditions for the Disarmament Conference. Herriot will leave England on Saturday to return to France.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency Paris, 11th - Following the announcement of French Prime Minister Herriot's visit to England, various newspapers have summarized the new "constructive disarmament security pact" proposals that France will present to the British Prime Minister. According to "Le Petit Parisien," this plan is based on the following five points: (1) a general disarmament convention, (2) a general mutual consultation convention, (3) a European regional security and management convention, (4) provisions for the gradual formation of an international army, and (5) conference records regarding the application of equal principles. "Le Parisien Echo" also published the same summary and stated that France hopes to establish a system with Britain and the United States that will make all countries responsible for maintaining international conventions. If this plan can be realized, France will be prepared to greatly reduce its military. It is expected that the French cabinet will approve this plan at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday so that Herriot can take it to England.</p>
<p>▲Agence France-Presse London, 10th - Rumors that Britain had reached an agreement with Germany have been officially denied by British officials. The rumors originated in Geneva and were published in the newspapers this morning, stating that British Prime Minister MacDonald had agreed to support Germany's demand for equality in armaments. London is not only unaware of any such agreement, but it is generally believed that the problem, which has so far been considered unsolvable, is now being actively sought to be resolved. It is unfortunate that such unfounded rumors have been spread at this time. It is said that the spread of such rumors is enough to arouse various suspicions, damage international trust, and encourage some undesirable influences.</p>
<p>▲Agence France-Presse London, 10th - The diplomatic contacts between Paris and London over the past day have all been about the meeting between the two Prime Ministers. Because French Prime Minister Herriot has agreed to come to the United States to discuss the situation in Geneva after Germany withdrew from the meeting, the plan to convene a four-power conference has now been definitively abandoned. The London government now only hopes that MacDonald can find a practical solution to the current difficulties during the negotiations. MacDonald does not seem to have any precise plan to present to Herriot at present, but there are many whispers in informal circles, vaguely suggesting a suggestion that is being studied. The main terms are (1) a political truce for an indefinite period, during which Germany will not make any demands to revise its borders, (2) gradual disarmament by other countries, and (3) recognition of Germany's equal treatment in disarmament, but purely from a qualitative point of view. It is said that MacDonald does not seem to agree with this plan. He intends to prepare a plan before Herriot arrives in order to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Impressions Gained by US Senator Reed on His European Tour</h3>
<p>The Fate of the League of Nations Hinges on the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>Quite Pessimistic About the Future of Disarmament</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency New York, 10th - US Senator Reed returned from Europe and stated today his observations from his European tour, claiming that if the League of Nations cannot resolve the Manchurian issue, then little will remain of the League of Nations itself. At present, none of the European countries have any intention of immediately recognizing "Manchukuo." The League of Nations' attitude towards the Lytton Report cannot yet be predicted, but it can be asserted that the League of Nations is facing a crisis in dealing with this issue. Reed was unwilling to express whether the European countries consistently supported the Far East policy announced by US government officials in repeated declarations, only specifically denying rumors that the United States had reached an agreement with Britain and France to support it, saying that all rumors were unreliable and that the United States had no such contacts. In addition, Reed was not very optimistic about the disarmament issue, predicting that various meetings in the near future would only serve to clarify the air and would probably not be able to establish an agreement to effectively reduce military spending. However, he was more optimistic about the repayment of war debts, saying that he believed that war debts would eventually be repaid. The position of most countries that owe money to the United States does not require the United States to cancel the loans. He firmly believes that they have the ability to repay their debts and are not happy to default. It is reported that Reed has submitted a detailed report on the war debts situation to the President, who will use this as material for his campaign, because Reed has always strongly supported the US President's policy of not canceling war debts and is therefore quite optimistic about it. In addition, although there are still many trade disputes between the United States and France, Reed guarantees that a new trade agreement can be concluded soon to resolve all disputes. It is noted that Reed is a member of the Senate's Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, and Finance Committees. Although his visit to Europe was in a private capacity, it is generally known that his talks with dignitaries of various countries were tantamount to representing US President Hoover. After returning to the country this time, he will also immediately report to the President in detail.</p>
<h3>Minister Gu Issues Statement in France</h3>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency Geneva, 9th - Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, after visiting French Army Minister Pengu today, issued a statement saying that China is prepared to accept the Lytton Report as a basis for negotiating a permanent and appropriate solution to the Manchurian issue. Gu also stated that China must of course preserve all its freedoms before starting negotiations. Gu also gave a brief description of the situation in Manchuria, saying that the number of Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria is now three times higher than on September 18 last year, when Japan suddenly turned a peaceful area into a chaotic zone.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin Demonstrate in Yangliuqing</h3>
<p>▲ Ostensibly a Parade, Secretly Surveying Maps of Key Areas</p>
<p>▲ Our Garrison Prevents Japanese Troops from Crossing the River, Japanese Force Us to Sign - Tianjin Correspondence: More than two thousand Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin have been conducting exercises day and night for the past month or two. Sometimes they hold full-scale exercises as if facing a major enemy, and sometimes they conduct exercises in shifts, blocking traffic. The Japanese troops have trampled all over the area within fifteen miles around the city. Initially, they acted freely without notifying our side in advance. Later, after Mayor Zhou Longguang repeatedly protested, they agreed to notify the Public Security Bureau by telephone at any time. The Public Security Bureau would then inform the urban and rural police districts to investigate and protect. However, the local authorities have never interfered with the Japanese troops surveying maps or taking photographs, knowing that protests would certainly be denied, so they could only endure and make concessions. Unexpectedly, the more we endured, the more rampant they became. On the 6th of this month, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, fully armed, with more than twenty officers, and three trucks carrying provisions and tents, departed from the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple, divided into two groups. One group went towards the Bali Tai Fort Zhuang area, and the other group passed through the Special Third District via the Nations Bridge, heading directly to Dazhigu (fifteen miles from Tianjin), where they erected tents and conducted night combat exercises, returning to the Japanese barracks the next day. The Japanese troops who went to Bali Tai went as far as Yangliuqing Town (south of Tianjin), more than thirty-five miles outside Tianjin, and had a dispute with the local garrison. The Public Security Bureau, fearing that it would incite public unrest, was unwilling to publish the details. The reporter inquired about the details from the Third Township Office in the rural area via a long-distance telephone, but they were also vague. The reporter then took the first Jinpu train at nine o'clock yesterday morning to conduct an on-site investigation, and learned that the area was defended by the 11th Brigade of the Northeast First Army, under Dong Yingbin. The brigade headquarters was located in the city. At 11:00 a.m. on the 6th, suddenly more than sixty armed Japanese soldiers, more than ten mounted officers, and two trucks carrying more than twenty Japanese soldiers, escorting military supplies, and two Japanese translators arrived. They rested at the Wenchang Palace on the south bank of the Grand Canal. The Third Township Office, upon hearing the news, reported to the brigade headquarters on one hand, and gathered all the ferries and merchant ships on the north bank on the other hand. They also reported to the Public Security Bureau by telephone and requested instructions as to whether they had obtained permission from the Public Security Bureau. The Bureau replied that they had heard nothing about it and should deal with the situation peacefully as circumstances dictated. At that time, Brigade Commander Dong was in Tianjin, and there was only one battalion of the 632nd Regiment stationed there. Battalion Commander Liu urgently dispatched a battalion of infantry to deploy defenses on the north bank and took strict precautions to cut off traffic. The Japanese soldiers on the south bank also shouted and jumped, intending to cross the river. At this time, the situation was extremely tense. If there were troublemakers at the time who set off a firecracker, the Japanese soldiers would surely point the finger at us for firing the first shot and causing a conflict. By 12:00 noon, the Japanese soldiers had not retreated, so Zhao Shichang, the head of the Third Township Office, together with Zheng, the deputy battalion commander of the 632nd Regiment, crossed the river to negotiate. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that the Japanese soldiers retreated. According to Director Zhao, the town is a little far from Tianjin, and the Japanese soldiers have never been there before. Their sudden arrival without prior notification inevitably caused unrest among the people. With both sides facing each other across the river, it was feared that if the time was too long, other incidents would inevitably occur. Therefore, I, together with Deputy Battalion Commander Zheng, crossed the river to inquire about the intention of the Japanese soldiers. When talking with the Japanese officer, someone was taking notes beside me, all in Japanese. After the conversation, the Japanese officer ordered Zheng to stamp and sign the notes. Zheng, not knowing what was written on the notes, immediately rebuked him sternly, saying, "Japan claims to be a civilized country in East Asia, but your actions are very uncivilized. The three northeastern provinces have been occupied by your troops. May I ask who signed the treaty? Today is just an ordinary conversation, so why is it necessary to sign?" However, the Japanese troops still insisted on crossing the river for a tour. We did not agree, and the situation was tense, almost to the point of breaking down. The Japanese troops even rubbed their fists and were eager to try. Finally, I told them that this place was outside the scope of Tianjin and was not a treaty port. If your troops must come for a tour, please go back and obtain permission from the provincial government. Then the military and police in this town will naturally welcome and entertain you. The Japanese officer, seeing that we were also on guard, held on until 5:00 p.m. before returning to Tianjin in disappointment. The conversations between the two sides at that time were as follows: Zheng asked, "Did your troops come here fully armed to draw maps or for a tour?" The Japanese officer replied, "I was a classmate of Chairman Yu Xuezhong (actually they were not classmates), and I came specifically to visit your brigade commander and present gifts to strengthen our relationship (did not respond to the question of surveying maps)." Zheng replied, "Our brigade commander is in Tianjin for a meeting, and our battalion commander is ill and cannot receive you. If you have gifts, please leave them, and we will forward them." At this time, the Japanese officer showed a package (not knowing what was inside) and said, "This is a gift, but it must be delivered in person and cannot be left behind," and questioned me in a accusatory tone, "Why do you not express your welcome to our troops' arrival? This lacks international etiquette." Zheng replied, "We did not receive any notification in advance, and we do not know the purpose and mission of your troops' arrival, so we did not welcome you. Please forgive us." The Japanese officer asked, "Can you take full responsibility on behalf of the brigade commander and battalion commander?" Zheng replied, "I can take full responsibility." The Japanese officer asked, "Can you allow our troops to cross the river for a tour of the streets?" Zheng replied, "The streets are simple and are also a garrison area. If you must cross the river for a tour, please disarm, and I will take full responsibility for your protection. Otherwise, we brothers are rude, and I am afraid that misunderstandings will occur, so it is difficult to allow it." Upon hearing this, the Japanese officer smiled grimly and said, "Disarm? Impossible, impossible." Then he took several photos and left. (October 9th)</p>
<h3>Report on the Suppression of Bandits in the Small Northwest of Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ The Two Bandits from Northern Fujian and Northern Shaowu Retreat to Chong'an</p>
<p>▲ The Armies in Western Fujian Will Launch a General Attack on the Bandits</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping, the two groups of Red bandits entrenched on the border of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, invaded northern Fujian from Yanshan, eastern Jiangxi, in late last month, capturing the two counties of Chong'an and Pucheng. Subsequently, Qian Yuguang, the deputy brigade commander of the Third Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, led the two regiments of Nie Jinlong and Zhang Chunguang, and returned to attack Pucheng from Songxi. Liu Shangzhi, the brigade commander of the 56th Division of the Army, led the two regiments of Gan Fu and Li Huan, and returned to attack Chong'an from Jianyang. The bandits were attacked from both sides, looted extensively, and then abandoned Pucheng and retreated to Chong'an. Qian Yuguang stationed in Pucheng on September 28th to handle the aftermath. On the Chong'an side, they are still holding out between Xingtan and Chishi. The bandits have also dug trenches and built gun towers in the area where Pucheng and Chong'an meet, in an attempt to resist stubbornly. Liu Shangzhi also transferred the Ma Hongxing Regiment from Shaowu to Jianyang on October 3rd, to cooperate with the two regiments of Li Huan and Gan Fu, and attacked the bandit areas of Chishi, Xingcun, and Gu County simultaneously in three routes, so that the bandit leaders could not take care of each other. In the rear of Jianyang and Jian'ou counties, the two regiments of Kong Haikun and Tang Bangzhen were still stationed to guard.</p>
<p>On the western Fujian side, the 19th Route Army and the bandits are still holding out in Longyan. However, the Red bandits are very cunning in their tactics. Zhang Dingcheng, the commander of the pseudo-Red Army 7th Independent Division and chairman of the pseudo-Fujian Soviet Government, is stationed in Longyan. Wei Binghui, the commander of the pseudo-Red Army 12th Army and commander-in-chief of the pseudo-Fujian Military Region, is stationed in Changting. Whenever there are battles in Longyan, they transfer the bandits from Changting to support. Whenever there are battles in Changting, they transfer the bandits from Longyan to support, coordinating with each other to resist the National Army. Cai Tingkai has now decided to launch a general attack on Tinglong at the same time, so that the bandits will be attacked from both sides. The plan is to have the two divisions of Qu Shounian and Shen Guanghan attack Longyan from Nanjing and Yongding, and to request the two divisions of the Guangdong Army, Huang Renhuan and Huang Tingzhen, to attack Changting from Shanghang and Wuping. All four routes will advance simultaneously. It is said that Qu Shounian was ordered to go to Guangdong recently to discuss the joint suppression plan with Chen Jitang. The military deployment in Fujian is now ready, and the two Guangdong Army teams have arrived in Shanghang and Wuping, and most of them have also concentrated in Jiaoling and Pingyuan. As soon as Qu Shounian returns to Fujian, the general attack can begin. (October 6th)</p>
<h3>Headquarters Formulates Regulations on Military Colonization in Bandit Suppression Areas</h3>
<p>▲ Ordered to Be Followed by the Provincial Governments of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, recently formulated regulations on military colonization in the bandit suppression areas, and ordered the three provincial governments to follow them on the 10th. The original order is as follows: "The system of military colonization in our country originated in the Western Han Dynasty, and has been followed by successive dynasties, with significant achievements recorded in history. The reason for its origin is that it was during a period when soldiers were not guarding, and it was in a resident area where land could be reclaimed. Initially, agriculture was integrated with the military, with the military guarding agriculture. Then, the military was transformed into agriculture, with agriculture supporting the military. Used in combination, it is the best system. Now, the bandit areas in various provinces have been recovered one after another, and the local situation is extremely miserable. Some areas have suffered from bandit devastation, resulting in a daily decrease in population and barren land. Many farmers have been deeply red, or have been coerced into fleeing by the bandits, and cannot return to their hometowns for a while. Many land boundaries have been confused and deeds lost after being distributed by the Red bandits, making it impossible to organize and return them to the original owners for recognition. Moreover, there are areas that are adjacent to the Red bandits, which are their areas of activity, or their contested areas, causing the people to be unable to cultivate in peace. For the sake of thoroughly suppressing bandits once and for all, it is necessary to consider the situation, divide the regions, and adopt the system of military colonization, which is sufficient to plan for the aftermath. Therefore, the regulations on military colonization in the bandit suppression areas have been formulated, to serve as a basis for implementation. First, the standards for a military colonization county and a military colonization area are set, and the limits of their division are set, to stabilize the people's livelihood and consolidate the military's morale. Secondly, a tight military deployment is used to organize rural Baojia, to clarify responsibilities and facilitate governance. Furthermore, land is awarded based on the number of people, and procreation is encouraged. All soldiers' families are equally benefited, so that they have a sense of defending their territory and protecting their homes, and are happy to stay. At the same time, the establishment of rural cooperatives jointly organized by soldiers and civilians is promoted, to improve mutual assistance efficiency, and eliminate the barriers between locals and outsiders. Other aspects, such as the convening of Baojia meetings, the subsidizing of reclamation materials, the dissemination of agricultural knowledge, and the provision of work-rest facilities, are clearly stipulated to provide guidance for compliance. By handling matters in this way, not only will the Red bandits not be regenerated, but it will also be a model for autonomous villages. As for which county should be designated as a military colonization county, which part of a county should be designated as a military colonization area, either the provincial government and the administrative supervisors carefully plan, designate, and submit for approval, or the headquarters conduct detailed investigations and formulate appropriate regulations, which will be followed in separate orders. Now, the regulations on military colonization in the bandit suppression areas are specially issued with this order, and you are to follow them and order your subordinates to follow them as well."

<h3>Chiang Orders Strict Handling of Embezzlement of Dyke Funds Case</h3>
<p>▲ Hubei Provincial Government Offers Reward to Arrest Cha Wenqu Again</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In the case of Liu Wenjin, the accountant of the former Dyke Construction Funds Management Committee, and Cha Wenqu, the manager of the Sichuan Jianglong Opium Company, colluding to embezzle dyke funds, Zhang Nanxian, the director of the Disciplinary Committee of the Party, reported the case, and Liu Wenjin was arrested and detained for handling. However, Cha Wenqu is still at large. General Commander Chiang recently decided on two measures to handle the case and ordered the Hubei Provincial Government to comply with them: (1) Cha Wenqu is a major criminal in the embezzlement of dyke funds. After being arrested with a reward, the dyke funds were not paid off, but he was allowed to be released on bail, causing him to escape without a trace, and the funds are still outstanding. The former accountants Li Wenbao and Long Shaoyou, and the former official Chen Zonglin, and the former director of the Yichang Customs Dyke Donation Collection Office, Xu Jieming, and Wu Lianqing, etc., are all accomplices in embezzlement or jointly committed fraud, and should be severely punished in accordance with the law. It is not possible to let them off with simply returning the embezzled dyke funds. The provincial government should offer a reward again to arrest Cha Wenqu and bring him to justice. The other criminals, such as Li Wenbao, Long Shaoyou, Chen Zonglin, Xu Jieming, and Wu Lianqing, etc., should also be arrested and brought to justice to be punished in accordance with the law to demonstrate justice. (2) The position of accountant of the Hubei Dyke Construction Funds Management Committee is of utmost importance. Liu Wenjin was able to hold this position, and there must be someone responsible for guaranteeing him. Now that he has committed the serious crime of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, the person responsible for guaranteeing him should bear joint responsibility. Moreover, the dyke funds are related to the lives of the entire Hubei province and are extremely important. The former members of the Hubei Dyke Construction Funds Management Committee all had direct supervisory and management responsibilities. When this case occurred, when the former provincial government sent personnel to check the accounts, the members not only did not thoroughly investigate the matter, but instead made excuses and requested that Liu Wenjin, the accountant of the committee, be spared from punishment. In such a situation of conniving in fraud, they cannot escape blame. The provincial government should order Liu Wenjin's guarantor and each of the members to be responsible for compensating for the dyke funds that cannot be recovered, to emphasize the importance of dyke construction and to clean up officialdom. After the provincial government received the order, it submitted it to the 40th meeting the other day for compliance, and issued a notice to its subordinates on the 10th, ordering them to intensify the arrest separately and offer a reward of 10,000 yuan to arrest Cha Wenqu and bring him to justice. The criminals Li Wenbao, Long Shaoyou, Chen Zonglin, Xu Jieming, and Wu Lianqing should also be arrested and brought to justice for punishment in accordance with the law. The matter of ordering compensation will be handled separately, and so on. (October 10th)</p>
<h3>Zheng Jicheng's Assassination of Zhang Case: Jinan Court Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>▲ According to Criminal Law, the Sentence Should Be Death</p>
<p>▲ Because Zheng Surrendered Himself, the Sentence Can Be Reduced</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhang Zongchang was shot and killed by Zheng Jinsheng's stepson, Zheng Jicheng, and his follower Chen Fengshan, at Jinan Jinpu Railway Station on September 3rd. Zheng Jicheng was immediately detained at the Military Law Office of the Third Route Army Headquarters. For a time, those outside who hated Zhang Zongchang and sympathized with Zheng Jicheng's revenge flooded the government with letters and telegrams, requesting amnesty. Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated that Zheng should be sent to court for trial. If the sentence was too heavy, then the amnesty regulations could be invoked to ensure that both law and human sentiment were taken into account. On the 24th, the Provincial Government received an order from the Executive Yuan to hand Zheng over from the Military Law Office to the Jinan District Court. More than ten days have passed since then, and the Procuratorate has opened several investigative hearings to question Zheng. (Chen Fengshan has been repeatedly requested from the Headquarters by the court, but his whereabouts are unknown, and he has not been apprehended.) Prosecutors Zhu Fengxiang and Zhu Weiran initiated a public prosecution on the 7th of this month in accordance with Article 253 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The indictment stated that Zheng et al., with a unified intent, killed three people at the same time and place with the same action. According to Article 42 of the Criminal Law (Those who jointly commit a crime are all principals), each should constitute a violation of Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law (1. Premeditation; 2. Dissection, dismemberment, or other cruel acts) and should be sentenced to death. In accordance with Article 74 of the same law (If one act constitutes several crimes, or if one crime is committed by means of or as a result of committing another crime, the heavier punishment shall be imposed), the heavier punishment shall be imposed. However, Zheng surrendered himself before the crime was discovered, so his sentence for the crime he confessed to should be reduced by one-third, and in accordance with Article 77 of the same law (If the circumstances of the crime are pitiful, the original sentence may be reduced as appropriate), a reduction may be considered. The full text of the indictment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Indictment of the Procuratorate: Defendant Zheng Jicheng, male, 40 years old, native of Licheng, residing at No. 7 Bianzhi E Lane, Jinan City, currently unemployed. Chen Fengshan, whereabouts unknown, age, origin, address, and occupation are unknown. The above-listed defendant is believed to be guilty of murder after the Procuratorate's investigation is completed. The facts of the crime, reasons for prosecution, and the articles of law violated are listed below: (1) Facts of the crime: Former Shandong Military Governor Zhang Zongchang, on September 2nd of this year, brought his entourage Liu Huaizhou (i.e., Liu Huaizhou, the same below), Liu Qingxun, Xia Tingfang, etc. from Ping (Beiping) to Jinan, residing in the Shi Mansion on Weiyi Road. At that time, local newspapers all reported that Zheng Jicheng, the stepson of Zheng Jinsheng, former Deputy Commander of the Eighth Route Army, and his follower Chen Fengshan, upon reading the newspaper and learning that Zhang Zongchang had killed Zheng Jinsheng in 1927, harbored resentment. On the afternoon of September 3rd, at around 3:00 PM, Zheng Jicheng returned home from the Charity Association. Upon hearing that Zhang Zongchang was returning to Ping that day, he conceived the idea of assassinating Zhang Jin to avenge his father. After dinner, he telephoned the Shi Mansion and learned that Zhang Zongchang's luggage had already been loaded onto the train, and he considered this a good opportunity not to be missed. At 5:30 PM, he and Chen Fengshan, carrying a pistol of his own, and Chen Fengshan also carrying a pistol belonging to Zheng Jicheng, took a car to Shi</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Mansion gate, seeing no cars entering or leaving, they thought that Zhang Zongchang had already departed. They rushed to the South Railway Station of the Jinpu Railway. At that time, the northbound train was stopped on the third track of the second platform and was about to depart. Zhang Zongchang came out of the first-class sleeping car to see off guests. Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan mixed into the crowd of pedestrians and raised their guns to shoot. The bullet did not fire, and Zhang Zongchang glimpsed it and turned back into the car. He went around the front of the car, jumped down, and fled northeast. Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun rushed to the rescue upon hearing the alarm. Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan opened fire and pursued them. Zhang Zongchang and Liu Huaizhou were fatally wounded and fell to the ground, dying soon after. Liu Qingxun was also injured, but fortunately, he did not die after treatment. Afterwards, Zheng Jicheng surrendered himself to the officers and soldiers of the law enforcement team stationed at the station by the Third Route Army Headquarters for the Suppression of Rebels. The team handed Zheng Jicheng over to the Military Law Office, which transferred him to the Shandong Provincial Government, which in turn sent a letter to the Shandong High Court Procuratorate to issue an arrest warrant. (2) Reasons for prosecution and articles of law violated: Upon examination, the body of Zhang Zongchang showed a gunshot wound on the left cheekbone connected to the lower outer corner of the left eye, measuring approximately six fen in length and three fen in width, entering from the combined face and exiting from the right of the item (i.e., the right side of the occiput), with the entrance and exit each measuring approximately three fen. There was also a gunshot wound on the left cheek (i.e., below the lower edge of the left jawbone), measuring approximately three fen in length and two fen eight in width, entering from the left neck (i.e., the left side of the first cervical vertebra) and exiting, with the entrance and exit each measuring approximately three fen. Below the exit (i.e., the left side of the first cervical vertebra in front of the neck), there was another gunshot wound, measuring approximately three fen in length and two fen eight in width, entering from the right shoulder blade near the spine (i.e., exiting from the back of the neck near the center of the back), with the entrance and exit each measuring approximately three fen. On the back of the head, near the top of the head (i.e., the right parietal region), there was a bruise, obliquely four and a half fen long and two fen eight wide, with broken skin and blood. On the right arm (i.e., the right wrist joint), there was a bruise, obliquely one cun eight fen long and three fen wide, with broken skin and blood. It was determined that he died from gunshot wounds. The body of Liu Huaizhou showed a purplish-black area on the left flank (i.e., beside the left chest), measuring nine fen in length and width, with a high swelling around it and red skin inside, obliquely round for five fen and hard when pressed. A bullet was removed after cutting through the epidermis with a knife. On the right posterior flank near the spine (i.e., the right side of the eleventh thoracic vertebra on the back), there was a gunshot wound, measuring approximately six fen in length and three fen in width, with the bullet not exiting (the bullet removed from the left flank was the one that did not exit). On the outer side of the right knee (i.e., the upper outer condyle of the right tibia), there was a scratch mark, obliquely round for two fen, with the skin removed and red. Near the right wrist (i.e., the lower right forearm), there was a scratch, measuring approximately one cun two fen long and four and a half fen wide, with the skin removed and red. It was determined that he died from gunshot wounds. Liu Qingxun's right arm (i.e., the front lower right arm) had a gunshot wound with a length and width of approximately three fen at the entrance. The exit, which was through the right arm of the combined surface, had a length and width of approximately three fen. On the upper inner side of the left knee (i.e., the inner side of the lower end of the left femur, above the knee), there was a gunshot wound with a length of about six fen and a width of about three fen. The exit, which was on the outer side of the lower left knee (i.e., the lower edge of the 　 bone), had a length and width of about three fen. Only the skin and flesh were injured, and there was no danger to life. These facts have been verified separately, and autopsy reports and injury reports have been filled out. During repeated interrogations, the defendant Zheng Jicheng confessed without reservation to how he conceived the idea, how he carried the pistol, how he took a car to Jinan Railway Station of the Jinpu Railway, and how he shot and killed Zhang Zongchang to avenge his stepfather Zheng Jinsheng, to avenge the Party and the country, to make revolution, and to eliminate harm for Shandong. Although this office requested the Third Route Army Headquarters Military Law Office to extradite the defendant Chen Fengshan, it was replied that his current whereabouts were unknown, and he has not been apprehended. However, according to Zhang Zongchang's follower Xia Tingfang, "I saw two people (referring to the murderers), one wearing a gray coat, and I didn't pay attention to the other." Bi Shizhen, the patrol chief of the Fifth Sub-Precinct of the Southwest Township Branch of the Shandong Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, testified, "On September 3rd, I was ordered to go to the station to maintain order. On the second platform, I saw Chen Fengshan behind the people who were seeing off. I saw Chen Fengshan wearing a gray coat and aiming at Zhang Zongchang with a gun. I didn't carry a gun, so I ran into the waiting room. When the guns stopped firing, I came out of the waiting room. The commander of the armored car team, Meng Xianzhang, came out. He asked where the murderer had gone. Others said he went east. Meng Xianzhang went ahead, and I followed behind. We caught up with Chen Fengshan together. Meng Xianzhang shouted at him (referring to Chen Fengshan), 'Stop, drop the gun, and raise your hands!' Chen Fengshan said that he was avenging his military commander (referring to Zheng Jinsheng)." Zheng Jicheng testified that "[Chen Fengshan] was there to protect me. He brought a gun that was very small. I think when I went to the station, he protected me, and he must have been behind me. When I shot Zhang Zongchang, the station was in chaos." Considering all the evidence, it is evident that Chen Fengshan was indeed present and involved when Zhang Zongchang, Liu Huaizhou, and Liu Qingxun were shot. Furthermore, the defendants harbored resentment for a long time because Zheng Jinsheng was killed by Zhang Zongchang. This time, they carried pistols, took a car to the station, and committed the crime, which was undoubtedly premeditated. The defendants, with a unified intent, killed three people at the same time and place with the same act. According to Article 42 of the Criminal Law, each should constitute a violation of Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Paragraph 2 of the same law. In accordance with the provisions of Article 74 of the same law, the heavier punishment shall be imposed. Furthermore, Zheng Jicheng surrendered himself to the officers and soldiers of the law enforcement team before the crime was discovered. This office has investigated and confirmed this with the Military Law Office of the Third Route Army Headquarters, and he should have his sentence reduced by one-third for the crime he confessed to. Furthermore, the circumstances of the defendants' crimes are not without mitigating factors and may be reduced in accordance with Article 77 of the same law. In accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, public prosecution is initiated.

<h3>Hefei Cracks Down on Bandit Organization</h3>
<p>▲ Many Arrested Criminals Have Been Escorted to the Capital</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Hefei is the hub of northern Anhui, with a wealthy local population and a strong-willed populace. Recently, the Red Bandits disturbed the areas of Shu, Liu, and Huo, and were even more covetous of Hefei. Therefore, the Red Bandits had set up two organizations in Hefei: a mass movement organization and a transportation organization. One was in a certain well-known pharmacy in Feicheng, and the other was in the Zhangjia Vegetable Garden, five li east of Feicheng. Last month, the false executive committee of the Liu'an bandits suddenly ordered the two secret organizations to gather their accomplices for a riot on the 1st of this month. Unexpectedly, the garrison was heavily guarded, and the bandits had no opportunity. When the date arrived, the bandits from Liu'an, disguised as a large number of refugees, lurked under the city walls, preparing to respond temporarily. To their surprise, they waited all night and heard nothing. The bandit leader then vented his anger on the organizers of the two secret organizations and executed a certain Zhang, the bandit's military transportation committee member. Zhang was the owner of the vegetable garden and was quite respected. After being executed, his younger brother, filled with resentment, secretly went to the capital to report the crime. Subsequently, the capital dispatched more than fifty plainclothes military police and detectives, carrying weapons, and arrived in Hefei the day before yesterday. Zhang's younger brother acted as an informant, first going to a certain pharmacy in the city. At that time, the bandits were gathered to discuss preparations for a second attempt because the riot had failed. Therefore, more than twenty male and female bandit criminals were captured on the spot. In the upstairs of the pharmacy, two large boxes of propaganda were seized. Only then did a certain military police officer submit a document to the county government, requesting that the pharmacy be temporarily sealed. Afterward, they went to the Zhangjia Vegetable Garden and seized a large number of firearms and explosives. All of them were immediately sent to the county government for safekeeping. The next night, a special vessel was hired to escort a thousand prisoners to the capital. They did not stop when passing through Wuhu. It is heard that most of the captured bandits were important members of the Red Bandits and had significant connections to the disturbances in Liu, Huo, and other places. (9th)</p>

Suddenly, his third son, Pinxiang, was kidnapped by bandits a few days ago. Because his eldest son had not been released, the victim dared not report to the authorities. After learning that the bandits had made an appointment to have the victim come to the Pigeon Ridge between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. on the 7th, the Wang Bureau of the Creek Public Security Bureau secretly sent several officers to investigate at the appointed time.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Yin Shisheng</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have read the news item regarding the Public Security Bureau Chief being sued in court, as reported in the Songjiang News section of your newspaper on October 8th. Upon verification, some of the facts are inaccurate. I hereby request the following corrections: Upon investigation, it has been found that Shi Wenhuan, the Chief of the Fengjing Branch Bureau, did collect over 400 yuan in rent, which was cleared by the Branch Bureau and sent to the General Bureau, with receipts obtained. The County Government did not demand repayment. This is inaccuracy number one. In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Chief Shen borrowed 200 yuan from my wife, Shi Yaxiong, which has not yet been repaid. With interest calculated at a rate of 1.3% per month, the total amount owed is over 340 yuan, not the sum of 408 yuan. This is inaccuracy number two. On the 27th of last month, Chief Shen sent Section Chief Yu Shifang to my home to urge me to settle the loan. Therefore, on the evening of the 2nd of this month, my wife personally went to the Bureau. She first met the accountant, Zhou Yili, and then met Chief Shen. Due to a dispute over the interest, she was grabbed by the hair, slapped in the face, and ordered to be beaten by the inspector Zhu Shikui and others, causing my wife to faint and fall to the ground. She was unconscious for two hours. After my family telegraphed the County Government and the Court, the Judge Wang Sixian and the County Secretary Tang Zhansheng arrived one after the other, but my wife was still unconscious. After she woke up, Judge Wang and Secretary Tang advised her to go home. At that time, my wife's body was sore, and her head and arms were covered with bruises. Judge Wang Sixian witnessed this with his own eyes. Chief Shen's barbaric behavior and insult to women left me with no choice but to telegraph the Provincial Department and sue the Court. On the morning of the 7th, an examination of the injuries and an investigation were conducted, but Chief Shen and Zhou Yili were not summoned to court. This is inaccuracy number three. The inaccuracies are likely due to hearsay. Therefore, I am making a factual statement and earnestly hope that the esteemed editor will make prompt corrections in order to avoid confusing the public. With anticipation and respect, Yin Shisheng, East of Xitang Bridge, Songjiang City.</p>

Xiao Hei-tan Chen Zhen-he's position, arranged as in the inter-port team, was on the left wing, looking imposing and invincible. It was a pity that the lack of cooperation led to no real achievement. Luo Hai-guang, the left inside forward, had the aura of Li Hui-tang, with neat footwork and a promising style. Dong Xiao-pei, the center forward, and Xi Qiao-sheng, the right inside forward, had good coordination. Mei Hong-bao, the right winger, delivered accurate passes. The half-back line was particularly strong. The center half Xu Ya-hui covered both front and back, tackling skillfully, a rare sight in Shanghai. Liang Shu-liang and Wang Shu-sen mirrored his style, adding stability. The full-back Zhu Qiu was a renowned Shanghai player, while Qian Yao-bin surpassed his predecessors, a rising talent. The goalkeeper Lu Zhong-en excelled at catching high balls, unmatched in Shanghai. The above lineup had good attack and defense, but the shooting was weak. However, in the second half, with the absence of Qian Yao-bin and Mei Hong-bao, and Yang Ren-wei taking the left wing, Xiao Hei-tan the center forward, and Xi Dong the right forward, the team's momentum declined significantly. With Chen Zhi-yun replacing the defender, the control became ineffective, leading to lapses that Dong Hua exploited. The lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Ren-wei (replaced Chen Zhen-he) Zhu Qiu Liang Shu-tang Luo Hai-guang Lu Zhong-en Xu Ya-hui Chen Zhen-he (replaced by Chen Zhi-yun) Wang Shu-sen Dong Xiao-pei Qian Yao-bin (replaced by) Xi Qiao-sheng Mei Hong-bao</p>
<p>▲ Dong Hua Comes From Behind</p>
<p>Dong Hua's victories often occur in the second half. Their two wins against the Western Police team both happened in the second half. In the match against Hua Lian, although they were down by one goal in the first half, they scored three consecutive goals in the second half, ultimately securing the victory. The performances of Li Ning, Yun You, Li Yi-chen, Chen Jia-qiu, and Chen Hong-guang were truly divine and worthy of admiration. Although Wu You-liang and Wan Xianghua were newcomers, their performance was no less impressive than the aforementioned players. The team's coordination was particularly excellent.</p>

<p>▲ Chairman Zhang Hui Presents Awards</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Hui and Chen Jian-ru attended the match. After the match, awards were presented. Zhou Xian-yan accepted the winning team's trophy, named "Sports for National Salvation," crafted and gifted by Sun Ke, and presented by Chairman Zhang Hui. The losing team received silver cups, "Courageous and Righteous," donated by Zhang Hui and Chen Ce, and presented by Chen Jian-ru, received by team captain Lu Zhong-en. The event concluded with three cheers.</p>

<p>▲ All Decorations Were Foregone</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 10th) was the National Day commemoration of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Various circles in the city, at 9:00 AM that morning, held a National Day commemoration ceremony at the Youth Propaganda Corps on Zhonghua Road.

<p>▲ Ceremony Proceedings: Xing Wan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, was publicly elected as Chairman, Pan Ding-yuan as Recorder, and Zhu Xiao-chun as Master of Ceremonies. The ceremony was carried out as planned. First, the Chairman reported, followed by Zhou Yu-bin, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, who spoke about the recent situation in the Northeast and his thoughts on the League of Nations report. Hu Shou-qi, representative of the First District Party Headquarters, spoke about political issues since the September 18th Incident. Huang E and others also gave speeches.

<p>▲ Citywide Situation: On Double Ten Day, various government agencies, organizations, factories, and schools in the city, due to concerns about the national situation and the Social Bureau's notice prohibiting work stoppages, all operated as usual. However, the financial and banking sectors and various newspapers took a customary one-day holiday. Stores throughout the city displayed national flags for the day in commemoration. The Public Concession, the French Concession police, and the district branches of the Municipal Public Security Bureau implemented an invisible martial law to prevent accidents. All major roads were double-posted, so the day passed peacefully. However, in the past, colorful arches were erected at the intersections of the Chinese-controlled areas and the Concessions. Major companies also hung lights and festoons at their entrances, and many stores were filled with red and green National Day lanterns, creating a moment of splendor. Now, the holiday remains the same, but the scene is entirely different. All decorations were omitted, and only national flags were displayed for a day. The bleakness of the situation, comparing the present with the past, is unbearably sad.</p>
<h3>Two Naval Ships Launched</h3>
<p>▲ The Jiang Ning and Hai Ning Ships</p>

<p>▲ Completion Expected by the End of the Year</p>
<p>The Navy's newly built Jiang Ning and Hai Ning gunboats held a launch ceremony at the Jiangnan Shipyard at 9:00 AM on Double Ten Day. The champagne bottle was smashed by the twin daughters of Zheng Le-tian, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>▲ Launch Circumstances: The launch ceremony was chaired by Navy Chief Chen Shao-kuan. After carrying out the ceremony as planned, the bottle-smashing ceremony began at 9:30 AM.

The Ministry ordered me to preside over the matter. Since the establishment of the National Government, the Jiangnan Shipyard has been ordered to build the Xian Ning, Yong Sui, Min Quan, Yi Xian, and Min Sheng warships, following a logical order and achieving significant success. These two ships are a continuation of this effort, and the beginning of building gunboats. Work began on January 15th of this year, originally scheduled to be completed in the summer. However, after only ten days, the defense of Shanghai began, and the project was suspended. The impact affected the finances of both the Navy Ministry and the Shipyard. After more than half a year, work was able to resume. The progress made is due to the Navy Minister's dedication and perseverance, cutting expenses and diligently providing support. The Shipyard employees also endured hunger and hardship, working hard to complete the task. Today, we can see the results, which will slightly increase our naval strength. From now on, the Navy will consolidate national defense and follow Commander-in-Chief Chiang's plan to build a 600,000-ton navy. The continued construction of warships cannot be delayed. Although we face extreme difficulties, our determination to overcome hardships will not waver. We hope that the government will continue to promote this effort, and that all of our citizens will unite as one, so that the Navy's growth will..."</p>
<h3>Sichuan War Has Erupted</h3>
<p>▲ Two Lius Shift Blame to Each Other</p>
<p>▲ Liu Wen-hui Resumes Telegrams from the Abolish War Association</p>
<p>The Sichuan war has erupted. The Abolish Civil War League sent telegrams to Liu Wen-hui and Liu Xiang the other day, urging them to mediate. Yesterday, the Abolish Civil War League received another telegram from Liu Wen-hui in Sichuan, stating that he would never be the leader of the war. The original telegram read: "To the General Association of the Abolish Civil War League, I have received your kind telegram, expressing your heartfelt desire for peace and your earnest encouragement. Though I am foolish, I deeply grieve for the national crisis. It is precisely when the defense of Kang is critical and we are unable to resist external enemies that we should resolve internal conflicts and make every effort to compromise. I hope that those who seek chaos will awaken, so as not to betray your sincere teachings. Then the evil atmosphere will turn into harmony. This is what I sincerely pray for. Liu Wen-hui bows, Yu."</p>
<p>▲ Liu Xiang's Telegram Reply to Zhang Qun</p>
<p>After the sudden attack by the defense forces of the two Lius in Sichuan, Central Committee member Zhang Yuejun telegraphed both sides to persuade them to reconcile. The day before yesterday, Zhang received Liu Xiang's reply telegram. The original text is as follows: "To Committee Member Zhang Yuejun, my brother, and to Committee Member Xiong Jin-fan, Mr. Huang Yangxie, and all colleagues, Upon receiving your telegram of the 30th, I deeply admire your love for your homeland and your heartfelt words. The brewing of the Sichuan situation has become increasingly apparent recently. The strife between the various departments is ready to erupt. I am alarmed by internal and external troubles, and I have been running around and pleading for peace, but my voice is already hoarse. Distant rumors are inaccurate, and suspicions arise. I love peace dearly. I not only plead with tears, but it is extremely difficult to stop the various parties from erupting. I will do my best to eliminate and comply with your earnest wishes. Special thanks for your understanding. Liu Xiang bows, Jiang."</p>
<p>▲ Liu Xiang's Telegram to Shanghai Representatives</p>
<p>On the 9th, Liu Xiang telegraphed his representatives in Shanghai, saying: "To Deng Ming-jie, Fan Chong-shi, and Fu Zhen-wu, my three brothers, confidential. Yang Qi and others reported that troops stationed in Shun under the 24th Army clashed with the Yang, Li, and Luo troops in an area 30 to 40 li from Shun. Each has sent telegrams. I have sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stating: 'I have repeatedly received telegrams from various parties reporting that troops stationed in Shunqing under the 24th Army clashed with the Yang, Li, and Luo troops in the border area of Shunqing, Yuechi, and Peng'an counties. They each have their own version of the cause of the conflict. At a time when the national crisis is at hand, internal stability is of utmost importance. Therefore, in the Dongri telegram, there was an announcement to wait quietly for a resolution regardless of right or wrong. But because the situation is complex, it has not stopped to this day. I am deeply ashamed and regretful. In addition to continuing to do my best to eliminate the expansion, I respectfully report and await instructions. Liu Xiang bows, Qing You.'"</p>
<h3>National Goods Exhibition Opened the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Over 200 Participating Stores, Over 4,000 Items on Display</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu's Admonishment: To Achieve Prosperity, Promote National Goods</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday Chen Mingshu and Chen Ce Visited the National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>The city's National Goods Exhibition officially opened at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (National Day) at the Penglai Market. Over 10,000 guests and visitors attended. Mayor Wu Tiecheng personally attended the meeting and delivered a speech. Art performances were held in the afternoon, and the programs were wonderful. The temporary market was crowded with customers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Attending Representatives: At the opening ceremony the day before yesterday, attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hong-jun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lin Jin from the Garrison Command, Chen Guang-rong from the Autonomous Preparatory Committee, Jin Li-ren from the Land Bureau, Wang Zong-wei from the Jianghai Customs Salt Supervisory Office, Fang Jiao-bo and Ma Shao-quan from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xu Xing-jia from the Health Bureau, Peng Li-ren from the County Party Headquarters, Lin Ke-cong from the Women's Relief Association, Wang Xun from the Local Court, Shen Ying from the County Education Bureau, Zhang Han-lun from the Post Office General Bureau, Wang Guo-xian from the Public Security Bureau, Chen Jing-zhai from the Women's Association for Promoting National Goods, Xu Qing-de from the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, and Lu Li-hua, Principal of the Liangjiang Girls' School, leading her entire class, as well as over 500 representatives from various trade associations, farmers' associations, labor unions, and schools.</p>
<p>▲ Participating Stores: Over 200 manufacturers participated in the exhibition this time, displaying over 4,000 items. Over 90 temporary participants also joined. Compared to the National Goods Exhibition in 1919, the situation is even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>▲ Ceremony Proceedings: At 10:00 AM, the bell rang to begin the ceremony. The Liangjiang Girls' Scout Troupe performed music on stage. The Municipal Public Security Bureau band played the Party Song. Chairman Wu Xing-ya, Recorder Xian Chao-ran, and Master of Ceremonies Xu Ye-fu conducted the ceremony as planned. First, the Chairman gave the opening speech, followed by Mayor Wu's address, speeches by Yu Hong-jun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lin Jin from the Garrison Command, Chen Yi-ting, a representative of the National Goods Organizations, Lin Ke-cong, a representative of the women's sector, and Kuang Zhong-mou, the owner of Penglai Market. The photo session and adjournment began at noon.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech: Today's opening ceremony of the National Goods Exhibition has two major significance: (1) To complete the revolutionary construction work, we must develop the national economy and state capital. The first phase of military destruction work of the Xinhai Revolution has long passed. We should continue to carry out construction work, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and complete the revolutionary cause. Looking at countries around the world, such as England's Industrial Revolution, Germany's protectionist industrial policy, Japan's industrial development promoted by political forces, and Russia's Five-Year Plan, all used the development of industry as a starting point for revitalizing the country. In view of this, we are holding a National Goods Exhibition to arouse public attention, so that they will know that promoting national goods is the only way to develop industry and commerce, which is to establish the national economy, complete the construction work, and realize the revolutionary cause. (2) This year's National Day is dull and joyless, so I hope that the entire nation, from top to bottom, will unite and resist foreign aggression, and only after eliminating the national crisis will we have the right to celebrate. The current urgent task is to pay attention to economic preparation, promote national goods, and avenge the shame and save the country, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor's Admonishment: Saving the country from disaster cannot be done by individuals alone. The people of the whole country, men and women, old and young, scholars, farmers, workers, and industrialists, must contribute their positions, occupations, knowledge, and abilities to the country. Only by finding ways to save the country can we see results. The root cause of China's weakness today is that it does not build the Chinese people. It only knows how to spend money and does not know how to earn money. If we examine the customs report, the import surplus reaches 200 million. Such a huge loss occurs every year, and the standard of living is increasing day by day. The necessities of life depend on foreign countries, and the outflow of money is unimaginable. If we want to save the situation, we must promote national goods. Only when factories throughout the country can manufacture the necessities of life for the people throughout the country can we say that progress is revolution, and China can achieve prosperity, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Airplane Flyers: In order to expand publicity, the association will use an airline plane at 2:00 PM yesterday, with propaganda director Zhu Ya-kui and others on board, to distribute flyers in the air over the Nanshi area, totaling over 100,000 sheets.</p>
<p>▲ Crowded Visitors: Yesterday, important figures who came to the exhibition included former Minister of Transportation Chen Ming-shu, former Guangdong Navy Commander Chen Ce, former Guangzhou Public Security Bureau Director Ouyang Ju, and the city's Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hong-en. They praised the national goods very much. Director Wen specially purchased a large leather suitcase from the Qin Feng Suitcase Factory to show his support.</p>
<p>▲ Art Performances: The program for yesterday was as follows: 1:45 PM to 2:00 PM, Shanghai Harmonica School harmonica performance; 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, Han Lan-gen's comical dance; 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, Steel Wire School steel wire dance; 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Xiao Wen-bin's Shanghai opera; 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Yi Fang-shuo's new drama; 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Ye Ru-yu's improved Suzhou Beach; 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, Everyone Laughs ventriloquism; 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, movie Black-Clad Female Knight.</p>

The day before yesterday, she hosted a banquet at the Licha Hotel to console Weng Zhao-yuan, the former brigade commander of the 19th Route Army, and invited Dr. Yin Zhi-ling and others to accompany her. Mrs. Moore met with Brigade Commander Weng to praise his bravery in defending the country, and instructed the restaurant orchestra to specially play Chinese national music to show her respect. She reported that the European public admired the 19th Route Army very much and hoped that the Chinese army would be as loyal and brave in defending the country as the 19th Route Army, and make efforts to prepare for external resistance. She heard that General Weng would represent the 19th Route Army to thank the overseas Chinese, and she deeply hoped that Mr. Weng would pay attention to contacting people from various countries. She was willing to be responsible for introducing and communicating with news agencies in various countries in advance, and help promote everything. General Weng responded by thanking Mrs. Moore for her kindness on behalf of the German women's sector. Not only he and the 19th Route Army were grateful, but also the people and army of the whole country were moved and excited to hear that Mrs. Moore had traveled thousands of miles to China to comfort the army's anti-Japanese spirit. They were united and determined to resist foreign aggression. He hoped that Mrs. Moore would widely publicize the facts she had learned from her investigation in Shanghai to the world, so that other countries could more easily understand the seriousness of the Far Eastern situation caused by the Northeast issue, which would endanger international peace. After 3:00 PM, Ma Zhan-shan's representative Ma Kui-jun went to visit General Weng before leaving with Dr. Yin Zhi-ling. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, Mrs. Moore also met with Sun Ke, the former President of the Executive Yuan, at his residence on Columbia Road.</p>
<h3>Dalian Customs Officials Expelled Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the puppet regime, under the instigation of Japan, forcibly seized all customs houses in Northeast China, the Dalian Customs was also taken by force. Many officials and clerks inside the customs house, unwilling to endure the violence and coercion, were expelled, and some were even placed under surveillance by the puppet authorities. The Dalian Customs officials suffered greatly. The customs personnel who were expelled by the puppet state have now departed from Dalian to return to Shanghai. Yesterday, those who arrived in Shanghai aboard the Japanese ship "Fengtian Maru" included Fu Qiutang, Zhu Huangzeng, Peng Qingwei, Wang Xiyu, Tian Bian'en, Yu Kunjing, Qiang Yijun, Chen Naixiang, Wu Hegu, Shi Youzhen, Shi Fanghuang, Shi Yanliang, Liu Puchen, Tang Ziliang, Fu Meide, Shang Baoyi, Zhang Mou, Zhao Mou, Li Shangwen, Liu Zuokai, Jiang Baoyuan, Han Jinzhi, Liu Zongfa, etc. More than ten family members, including relatives and children of the customs officials, also returned to Shanghai on the same ship. The customs officials all disembarked at the Huangpu Wharf. The Jianghai Customs had received a telegram in advance, so representatives were sent to the wharf to welcome the officials to Shanghai. They then went to the Tax Affairs Office and the Customs Service to report and to describe the circumstances of the violent seizure of the Dalian Customs and the suffering endured by the officials in Dalian. The central government will arrange for these expelled customs officials to serve in the customs service. Also arriving in Shanghai on the same ship were Wang Tufu, an official of the puppet Fengshan Railway, and Song Bikuang, an official of the Jichang Railway, who also arrived in Shanghai on this "Fengtian Maru" ship.</p>

<h3>Two Italian Agricultural Experts Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Coming to China at the Invitation of the National Treasury</p>
<p>Professor Terzaghi, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce of Italy, and Dr. Perilli, Secretary-General of the Agricultural Group of the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, have arrived in China at the invitation of the National Economic Council of our country, through the introduction of the International Union, to assist in resolving rural relief problems. Professor Terzaghi is an expert on land rent and rural economic problems. The National Government, in view of the rampant communist scourge and the instability of rural areas, recognizes that one of the causes is the high rents paid by tenants and the lack of lending institutions in rural areas, which forces farmers to rely on high-interest lenders. Therefore, in addition to military action, it urgently seeks to use political and economic solutions to alleviate the suffering of farmers. It has entrusted the League of Nations to hire Professor Terzaghi to come to China, hoping that he will use his experience to help solve this major problem. In addition to serving as Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, Professor Terzaghi is also the Secretary-General of the International Institute of Agriculture, the President of the Cooperative Bank, and served as a member of the Italian delegation to the Economic Group of the 1927 Geneva Peace Conference, as well as a preparatory member and member of the Geneva Economic Conference in 1927. He has written many books on agricultural economics throughout his life. Dr. Perilli is assisting Mr. Terzaghi in his work. He holds a doctorate in law, has a diploma in Oriental languages, and is currently the Secretary-General of the Agricultural Group of the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, the Deputy Editor of the International Yearbook of Agricultural Law, and a member of the Italian Law Research Association. He is also a well-known writer on rural economics.</p>

<p>The China United News Agency's Shanghai dispatch on the 11th: To Messrs. Chu Huiseng, Li Cishan, Wu Shan, Yin Zhufu, and Feng Shaoshan of the Shanghai Volunteer Army Support Association, and Messrs. Xu Shiying, Xu Jigong, Li Denghui, Ye Chengming, Wu Shan, and He Yongzhen of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee: We received the telegram from Director Wang and Secretary Liu, and we deeply appreciate your efforts in organizing charitable donations to assist the Northeast. Du belongs to the military, and it is our duty to kill the enemy and defend the country. After years of fighting, we have failed to recover our homeland, which is a source of shame. We are even more encouraged by your collection of relief funds, which we will pass on to our troops. However, it is already cold in the Northeast, and soon there will be ice and snow. The isolated army in the remote frontier is lacking in both military pay and ammunition. Although we are determined to sacrifice ourselves to repay the country, it is difficult to repel the enemy empty-handed. We earnestly request your urgent assistance to replenish our supplies. If the lost territory is recovered in the future, it will be thanks to your efforts. With deep respect, we express our gratitude. Li Du, respectfully, with seal. It is also reported by Mr. Liu Piguang, a representative of General Li, that General Li telegraphed yesterday, informing them that he has sent Mr. Su Zhengchun south to report on the recent anti-Japanese situation of the Self-Defense Army. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>

<h3>Three Bombings in Two Days</h3>
<p>▲Yinxiang Township on the 9th, French Concession on the 10th</p>
<p>In the past two days (the 9th and 10th), three bomb throwing cases by the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Corps" occurred in Yinxiang Township and the French Concession. Details are recorded separately:</p>
<p>▲Dasheng Rubber Factory At 12:00 noon on the 9th of this month, the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Corps" suddenly threw a powerful bomb at the Dasheng Rubber Factory in Xinshi Market, Yinxiang Township. It exploded on the spot with a loud noise. As the workers were on their lunch break, no one was injured. Cao Taosheng, the manager of the factory, a native of Pudong, was frightened and at a loss. After a long time, he came out to investigate and found that the explosion occurred at the window of the factory's Building No. 611, only destroying several panes of glass. He did not report it to the police.</p>
<p>▲Tailong Foreign Goods Cloth Shop The Tailong Foreign Goods Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 75 Huolun Millfang Street in the French Concession has been doing very well in business. For the past two months, it had repeatedly received warning letters from the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Corps," advising it not to sell inferior goods in the future. At around 2:00 PM on Double Tenth Day, members of the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Corps" went to the shop with a bomb and carried out a bombing. As the shop was crowded with customers and noisy, a large black ball suddenly flew in from outside the shop, making a loud bang that shook the surrounding area. Customers and shop assistants immediately fled in panic. After a long time, the thick smoke gradually cleared, and upon inspection, it was found that two pieces of glass in the display window were destroyed, and a small square of the floor was blown up, but no one was injured. Upon hearing the news, the police immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. The bomber had long disappeared. They picked up the shell of the bomb and took it back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>▲Deshengxiang Foreign Goods Store At the same time, two young men suddenly came to Deshengxiang Foreign Goods Store at the intersection of Millfang Street. They stood at the door and windows and first threw a letter inside, then threw a bomb inside with a loud bang. The house shook, and a fire broke out at that time. Thick smoke filled the air, and the doors, windows, glass, cloth, and other items were all destroyed by the explosion. The bombers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, calmly disappeared. Afterwards, the shop's staff opened and read the letter, and learned that it was a warning letter from the Shanghai Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Corps. The main idea of the letter was that if it was found that they were selling enemy goods again, they would be given a further warning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Arima Yoshimi Left for Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Arima Yoshimi, the Japanese Ambassador to China, plans to hold a reception with the ambassadors of various countries in China to exchange views after presenting his credentials to the National Government.

The Marine Corps also sent a team of soldiers to provide security, and the Naval Music Corps also went to play music to see them off. The ship set sail at 9:05 AM. Arima Yoshimi will first go to Qingdao, then to Dalian, and then to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes Among Workers of the China Merchants Electric Company Over Wages for National Day</h3>
<p>▲Secretary Feng Liutang Severely Injured in Beating</p>
<p>▲Large Number of Police Officers Suppress the Situation, Streetcars Stop Running</p>
<p>▲Signature Decision Made in the Evening, Situation Returns to Normal</p>
<p>▲Party and Government Organs Strictly Investigate the Culprits</p>
<p>All workers of the China Merchants Electric Company believed that they should have a holiday for National Day. The directors of the Water and Electricity Industry Union of the First District negotiated with the company, but to no avail. On the day of National Day, the union fought for it again, causing disturbances. Secretary Feng Liutang was beaten and seriously injured. In the afternoon, the workers closed the main gate of the streetcar depot, causing the streetcars to stop running. Fortunately, the party and government organs mediated, and the situation was brought to an end in the evening and returned to normal. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Labor Disputes Erupt Workers' Union directors Chuan Chongde, Zhang Gendong, etc., went to the company on the 8th to request a holiday for National Day. If there was no holiday, wages should be doubled. Secretary Feng Liutang of the company, citing the notice No. 14695 from the Municipal Party Department, etc., stipulated that according to the central government's order, factories should work as usual and should not pay double wages. He politely replied. The directors of the union then withdrew. On the morning of National Day, the Union director Chuan Chongde and others went to the factory at the same time. About twenty or more workers followed. There was a conflict of words between the two sides. The workers, without asking the reason, threw teacups and wooden sticks for newspaper wrapping at the company secretary Feng Liutang. When the nearby guards first received the report and arrived, Feng had already been seriously injured.</p>
<p>▲Large Number of Police Officers on Alert Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, immediately dispatched mediator Wang Gang to mediate at 10:00 AM. At the same time, the municipal government, upon receiving the report, also immediately dispatched a platoon of security guards to suppress the situation and notified the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus to send personnel to handle the matter quickly. Wen Hong'en, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was ordered to dispatch inspectors Wang Wenjun, Guo Lai, and Jiang Yuewu, as well as a platoon of the police brigade. Jin Yin, the district chief of the Second District Police Department, led police officers to the scene. They were on strict alert near the China Merchants Electric Company at the South Railway Station. The workers inside the company were gathering in large numbers, the order was chaotic, and the situation was serious. The workers controlled the gate and prohibited entry and passage. When Lian Ze, a cadre of the Municipal Party Department, arrived in the afternoon, he was inspected by the workers before being allowed to enter.</p>
<p>▲Party and Government Officials Dispatched to Mediate After the representatives of the party and government organs arrived, they immediately tried to mediate. The workers sent temporary representatives Fang Ronggeng, Xu Rensheng, Wang Qingyi, Lu Afa, and Wu Xiangming, and the Workers' Union representatives Fu Chongde, Zhang Dong, and Tan Honglin, etc. In addition to demanding double wages for National Day, they demanded that the issues of salary increases be resolved immediately. They limited the company to hold a board meeting immediately. Then, Manager Lu Bohong accepted the workers' demands and immediately asked Chairman Wang Yiting and Du Yuesheng by telephone, but because of the time constraints, it was impossible to convene a meeting. The manager immediately replied truthfully, but the workers were still dissatisfied and insisted that it be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>▲Streetcars Stopped at That Time At around 3:00 PM, the workers, believing that mediation was difficult to establish, immediately ordered the streetcars passing through the South Railway Station to enter the factory and closed the main switch of the streetcars, stopping the current. As a result, the streetcars on Route 1 (Xiaodongmen to Gaochangmiao), Route 2 (Laoximen to Xuejiabang), Route 3 (Road), and Route 4 (Laoximen to Gaochangmiao) were completely stopped on the road due to lack of electricity. Passengers had no choice but to get off, and traffic was disrupted as a result.</p>
<p>▲Signed Decision on the Measures By 6:00 PM, the representatives of the party and government organs had made great efforts to mediate, and a decision was made on the issue of salary increases. The representatives of the party and government organs immediately signed as witnesses. However, the issue of double pay for National Day was not resolved because it concerned a central government order. The original text is recorded as follows: Measures decided by the labor and management of China Merchants Electric Company on the issue of salary increases, etc.: (1) Manager Lu is responsible for submitting it to the special board meeting to be held tomorrow and requesting the board meeting to send responsible representatives to directly negotiate with the workers' representatives at the company at 1:00 PM on the 12th of this month and resolve it by the morning of the 15th. If there is no result, the party and government organs will quickly mediate according to law. (2) When the salary increase issue is resolved, it must be retroactively paid from July 1st of this year. (3) Other issues will be quickly negotiated by the board of directors sending responsible representatives to negotiate with the workers and resolved before the end of October. (4) The workers should immediately restore normalcy. October 10, 21st year of the Republic of China. Note: The signing location is at the China Merchants Electric Company. The original is stored in the Social Affairs Bureau. The workers' request amendments are as follows: (1) Workers' salary increases should be based on the standard of the percentage of salary increases for employees. (2) The employee welfare fund and the worker care and education fund should be merged and evenly distributed. (3) The worker annual bonus should be equal to that of employees, uniformly two months. (4) If a holiday falls on a Sunday, a day off should be made up. The Double Tenth Day should be handled as usual.</p>
<p>▲Normalcy Restored in the Evening After the labor and management signed at around 6:00 PM, the workers dispersed. The police brigade and security brigade completely withdrew. At the same time, the main switch of the streetcar was turned on, and the streetcars on each route returned to normal. At the same time, the injured Secretary Feng Liutang was escorted out of the factory by representatives of the party and government organs and sent to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that Feng Liutang vomited blood and was seriously injured.</p>
<p>▲Party and Government Seriously Investigate Reporters from Xinsheng News Agency visited the responsible persons of the Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Party Department, and Municipal Public Security Bureau. According to them, the order of the Central Executive Committee was that factories should not stop working and work as usual on National Day this year, without double pay, and this was announced to both labor and management for compliance. The fact that the workers of China Merchants Electric Company first demanded a holiday and then demanded double pay, resulting in the beating of the company secretary and other incidents, is a violation of national laws and is extremely inappropriate. It has now been decided to strictly investigate to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>▲Secretary Requests Resignation Secretary-General Feng Liutang of the company, since being beaten by workers at 9:30 AM the day before yesterday (the 10th), was only able to go to the hospital for treatment at 7:00 PM. He was seriously injured and is now recuperating in the hospital. He also reported the details of the injury to the company's board of directors and requested resignation. The original letter read: "Respected Sirs, I arrived at the company at 8:30 AM yesterday morning and saw that the work of each department was as usual, intending to abide by the orders of the party and government organs. I thought that the matter of requesting a holiday and salary increase the day before yesterday had been resolved. Who would have thought that at 9:00 AM, three representatives of the labor union, followed by more than twenty workers, rushed into the board room with great momentum. Without asking the reason, they threw teacups and wooden sticks for newspaper wrapping at Liutang. Some also punched repeatedly, causing Liutang's upper right eyelid to be injured, with blood flowing all over his face. He supported himself with his hands, and his palms were all red. His right cheek was also injured by a wooden stick, turning blue and swollen. The bone in his right back was severely injured by a punch, even affecting his chest, causing painful breathing. He vomited blood several times, and he had never had this disease before. The glass on his face was also shattered. The workers believed that Liutang was the sole reason for working as usual today when they had historically been given holidays and double pay for National Day. They forced him to agree to pay double wages in order to resolve the matter. Liutang said that he did not have the authority to make such a direct decision in business. While he was reasoning, Manager Lu arrived and took him to the manager's office to temporarily avoid the situation, but the workers surrounded and roared, still as before. They continued to make demands, causing endless entanglement, until 6:30 PM in the evening, when he was escorted out by representatives of the party and government organs and was able to go to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, it was said that Liutang was beaten this time because he was incited by communists on the spot. It must be known that the public sentiment was surging at that time, and Liutang, though foolish, would never have done this. The workers were merely motivated by anger, failed to discern right from wrong, and deeply believed in rumors, using barbaric force. Such actions cannot but cause unlimited regret for the future of the labor movement. Even in labor-management disputes, there may be different positions and different views, which are the responsibility of each party, and a solution can be sought in the middle of the two sides based on legal facts and realities. How can one rely on the crowd to act recklessly and direct their arrows at an individual, using violent means? Liutang, from the beginning of this incident, knew that there would be many disputes and obstacles, and that the gate of right and wrong was not easy to handle, but he still exhausted his foolish sincerity and exerted his meager efforts, all in order to jointly seek development and achieve the practical effect of labor-management coordination. Therefore, he did not dare to fear difficulties and seek only temporary peace. Now, although he has encountered this unprecedented humiliation and narrowly escaped an accident, he asks his conscience and feels that his mind is at peace, with nothing to be ashamed of. He feels satisfied that he has informed his friends of his feelings. Therefore, he resigns to make way for the capable. He hopes to be granted permission."</p>
<h3>The Sauce Industry Labor Dispute Has Been Declared Resolved</h3>
<p>▲The Sauce and Wine Industry Also Agreed to Fulfill the Conditions</p>
<p>Da Gong News reported that the sauce industry employees in this city, because the capital side was unwilling to fulfill the old-established conditions, specially organized a conditions maintenance committee to carry out negotiations, and were about to brew a slowdown of work. Then, they were instructed by the Municipal Party Department, and the capital side continued to fulfill the old-established conditions. At the same time, the Sauce Enclosure Industry Trade Association expressed its responsibility and acceptance, so the situation has eased. However, the Sauce and Wine Industry side still had no definite reply, so the labor dispute became tense again. Yesterday, the above conditions maintenance committee received a letter from the Sauce and Wine Industry Trade Association inviting them to talk. The association then sent Shao Guoyong and others to negotiate with the trade association's Han Xingwei, Chen Xikang, and Zhu Debao as responsible negotiators. As a result, Han Xingwei and others expressed their full acceptance, and at the same time agreed that starting today, the sauce and wine industry will order each member to fulfill the previously agreed conditions, in order to show labor-management cooperation. Therefore, the labor dispute has been resolved.</p>
<h3>The Three Parties Met Yesterday to Discuss the Telephone Problem in the Area of the Extra-Boundary Road Construction</h3>
<p>▲But There Was No Progress</p>
<p>The Da Mei Shi Bao reported that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, and the Shanghai Telephone Company are still using the right to set up telephone lines in the area of extra-boundary road construction in the northern district as an obstacle to compromise. This morning (the 11th), the three parties officially met once, but it was heard that there was still no progress. At present, the representatives of the three parties are still continuing private talks, and it is feared that the date of the third meeting is still far away. According to the two formal meetings held so far, negotiations have been conducted on the draft agreement signed last October, hoping to be approved and implemented as soon as possible. In addition to the Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the General Manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Office Manager of the Board of Works, Wender, was also present at the meeting today. The Shanghai Telephone Company made several new proposals, the content of which has not yet been published. It was only heard that one of them was that the telephone company should pay 8,000 yuan in business tax to the Bureau of Public Utilities. As for the results of the meeting, it was claimed that all except the right to lay telephone lines in the area of extra-boundary road construction in the northern district had been agreed to. However, regarding the area of extra-boundary road construction in the northern district, the telephone company firmly demanded that regardless of whether the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has telephone lines, a certain distance along the road must be designated as the area for the company to promote telephone lines. The Bureau of Public Utilities and the Telephone Bureau insisted that the telephone company could only be allowed to promote in areas where the telephone lines of the Telephone Bureau had not yet reached, thus falling into a deadlock. As for the private talks that followed, they are now being kept strictly secret, and it is only heard that the time of complete agreement still seems to be awaited.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Opens</h3>
<p>▲Opening ceremony performed by Mrs. Dong Xiujia</p>
<p>▲The entire 216-kilometer journey takes five hours</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, constructed jointly by the National Economic Council and the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, with all sections of the road and the Minhang ferry completed, held an opening ceremony at 9:30 AM on October 10th on the opposite bank of Minhang. Departing at 10:15 AM, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration provided twelve public buses to carry guests, along with over eighty private cars, forming a long line to Hangzhou via Zhaolin, Jinshanwei, Zhapu, Haiyan, and Haining, arriving at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Ceremony Setup The ceremony venue was on the south bank of Minhang, facing the Huangpu River. On both banks were docks, and guests boarded and disembarked from cars via steel-hulled ferries and a wooden-hulled ferry towed by a gasoline boat. The stage faced east, and several dozen steps south, a decorated archway spanned the road, bearing the eight characters "Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Opening Ceremony." About four feet off the ground, a red silk banner was adorned with a flower in the center. On the stage were nine large and small flower baskets presented by the Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>▲Tight Security The Shanghai County Government, due to the opening ceremony of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway coinciding with the Double Tenth Festival, dispatched police and security teams led by Public Security Section Chief Yao Fusheng and Security Corps Director Xu Yi on the night of the 8th, in several trucks, departing along the Shanghai-Minhang Road at 4:00 AM. All areas under the county's jurisdiction, from Qian, to the Minhang ferry terminal, were heavily guarded. However, the ceremony site on the south bank of the Huangpu River fell under the jurisdiction of Fengxian County. At the request of the National Economic Council Preparatory Office, security for the ceremony was also handled by the county's police and security teams. In addition, the county government's patrol team assisted with mobile patrols. Security on the day was quite thorough, and the police and security teams were later rewarded with cash prizes from the ceremony organizers for their efforts.</p>
<p>▲Staff List Chairman Qin Fen, General Commander Guo Dehua, Order Commander Wu Jianzhou, Vehicle Commander An Tangrui, Dock Commanders Chen Wangong and Zhan Weiceng, Reception Tan Boying, Xue Cihua, Zhao Zukang</p>
<p>▲Opening Ceremony At nine o'clock, the bell rang to commence the meeting, with formalities observed. Chairman Qin Fen reported on the construction process and its significance. Dong Xiujia, Chen Cheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Dr. Ogginskee, a foreign consultant to the Economic Council, delivered speeches in succession. (Reports and speeches recorded separately). At the archway, the scissors were presented by the Chairman to Mrs. Dong Xiujia, who cut the silk ribbon, announcing the opening of the highway. The Educational and Industrial Film Company was present to film and record. ▲Chairman's Report Qin Fen, representative of the Chairman and Director of the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance, reported that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway's opening ceremony was being held today, noting that from the start of construction to its completion, it took four months. The efforts of the construction authorities of the two provinces and all personnel were commendable. The assistance of local officials and people along the way, and the planning of the Minhang ferry terminal by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Public Utilities, were particularly appreciated. In the past decade, our country has paid more attention to the construction of highways, but they have mostly been limited to one province, county, or urban area, with very few connecting multiple provinces. Some sections of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway were built over ten years ago, but only today have they been connected into one continuous route. From now on, transportation will be convenient along the route, and the export of agricultural products will be easier. The development of industry, commerce, and culture can be predicted. In addition to the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the highways constructed with loans from the National Economic Council include the Nanjing-Wuhu, Changxing-Xuancheng, Suzhou-Jiaxing, and Hangzhou-Huizhou lines, all of which are under construction and will be completed in three months. The total mileage open to automobiles will reach over 1,300 kilometers. As highways are the lifeline and supplement to railroads, their gradual increase will facilitate transportation, and cultural industries will flourish.</p>
<p>▲Speech Highlights After the Chairman's report, Dong Xiujia, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, spoke, stating that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway within Jiangsu Province is 76 kilometers long. The section from Shanghai to Minhang was built by a commercial company and completed many years ago. The section from Minhang to Nanqiao was built by Fengxian and Nanhui and is also an old road. The section from Nanqiao to Jin Sinong Bridge is 37 kilometers long and completely new, with eleven bridges and twenty-two culverts. The provincial government approved the construction on May 22nd, established a construction office on June 8th, and completed the entire road by September 25th, taking three and a half months and costing over 200,000 silver dollars. Besides the 46,000 yuan borrowed from the Economic Council, the rest was allocated by the counties along the route. Recently, some people have doubted whether building roads is as good as developing water conservancy, arguing that automobiles and gasoline all use foreign goods, which is too expensive. However, there are many people in our country who study mechanics, and in the future, we will definitely be able to manufacture gasoline ourselves. The reserves in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces are also very rich. It is only because of inconvenient transportation and high freight costs that foreign goods are imported, which is temporary and not permanent. Furthermore, if we only focus on water conservancy, farmers will still have to sell their agricultural products at low prices due to inconvenient transportation. Even with a bumper harvest, the low prices will hurt farmers. Therefore, the policy of the Jiangsu Construction Department is to emphasize both highways and water conservancy. After the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, with the leadership of the Economic Council, regulations have been established for the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Anhui to allow a unified pass, without territorial boundaries, which is particularly valuable. Chen Cheng, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration, spoke next, stating that this road is not intended to compete with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in terms of business, but is more geared towards tourism. The road runs along the sea dike and has many curves. Drivers should pay attention to speed. The original budget for the entire road was one million, but the current estimated cost is over 600,000. The remaining funds will be used for improvement or road maintenance, or it will exceed one million. The speeches of Wu Tiecheng and Ogginskee are omitted.</p>
<p>▲Along the Route After the ribbon was cut, Qin Fen and his wife, Dong Xiujia, drove off first in the same car, followed by the others. After more than twenty kilometers, they passed Zhaolin, traveling on the sea dike. The roadbed was relatively loose and bumpy. After another twenty-seven kilometers, they reached Jin Sinong Bridge, the border between Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After another twenty-one kilometers, they arrived at Zhapu, the Eastern Grand Port in the industrial plan. The cars needed refueling, so they rested. After another seventeen kilometers, they reached Haiyan. It was already one o'clock, and the Highway Administration sent people to serve tea and refreshments. Some of the guests returned to Shanghai from here, while those going to Hangzhou continued forward. Passing Zhapu, they reached the mouth of the Qiantang River, traveling along the river for more than twenty kilometers to Haining, where they rested briefly again. Continuing forward, they arrived just as the tide was at its peak, watching the tide from the cars along the way. Passing through swirling mist, they entered the Hangzhou city limits, arriving at the endpoint by the lakeside via Qingtai Gate at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The attendees dispersed, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway opening ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>▲Overall Project The sections between Shanghai and Minhang and between Minhang and Nanqiao are old roads for automobiles. The section from Nanqiao to Jin Sinong Bridge was built by Jiangsu Province, with more than half of the road surface paved with oyster shell powder, which is quite spectacular. However, the central part of the new roadbed is quite loose. The section from Jin Sinong Bridge to Zhapu was newly built by Zhejiang Province. The engineering from Zhapu to Hangzhou is old. The section from Haiyan to Hangzhou was meticulously done, however, in the section west of Haining, the soil is loose and there is very little coal ash covering, so after the car travel many times, it is showing the phenomenon of depression and unevenness. The entire line passes along the sea dike, so the twists and turns are inconvenient. At some point the excessive winding is currently being built as a new road. The width of the whole line, except for the Shanghai-Minhang section, is in accordance with the B-type standard set by the Economic Council. In the future, after the increase in vehicles coming and going, it is planned to broaden it to the A-type standard.</p>
<p>▲Passing Vehicles The public buses were originally scheduled to start running on the 16th of this month, but due to insufficient preparations, it will be around the 20th. The section from Shanghai to Minhang is still operated by the Shanghai-Minhang Nantu Company, while the section from Minhang to Hangzhou is operated by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration. Private vehicles traveling on this road will be charged a ferry fee this year, but from January 1st next year, it will be waived.</p>
<p>▲An Accident On the 10th, the day the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway officially opened, ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life drove to Hangzhou in an endless stream. A man named Wang Shulin, who lived at 46 Niuzhuang Road, was driving through Haiyan that day when an ignorant village child placed a large stone in the middle of the road.

<h3>Clerk of the First Special Court Punished for Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>▲Sentenced to four months in prison and fined sixty yuan</p>
<p>▲Case of colluding with lawyers pending trial</p>
<p>Huang Chengxie from Huzhou, a clerk of the Shanghai First Special District Court, introduced a lawyer to Zhang De, the manager of the China Restaurant, in the case of stealing electricity. Later, he repeatedly solicited lawyer fees and asked Zhang for gifts, which was akin to soliciting bribes. This was heard by the chief inspector of the Fifth Branch of the High Court, who instructed the prosecutor's office of the First Special Court to send Prosecutor Zhang to search Huang's residence at 345 Dong Tangjia Lane. All the opium smoking paraphernalia was seized, and Huang was interrogated and detained pending investigation, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the prosecutor's office believes that Huang Chengxie's attempted fraud has been proven, so Prosecutor Zhang, who was in charge of the case, has prepared an indictment and filed a public prosecution with the same level court. The public hearing is expected to be held soon. As for the opium smoking paraphernalia seized in his residence, it constitutes the crime of privately possessing opium smoking paraphernalia under Article 13 of the Anti-Smoking Law. However, according to the stipulated Agreement on the Recovery of Legal Rights, the right to prosecute this matter belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Therefore, Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council, formally prosecuted Huang Chengxie in the summary court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning based on Article 13 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Judge Wu Zhen ordered the defendant to be brought to court for trial. Huang insisted that the opium smoking paraphernalia found in his house belonged to his uncle, and that a nephew could not interfere. He also denied that he had an opium addiction. The judge told him that there was a medical examiner's certificate proving that the defendant was indeed addicted to opium, which could not be refuted. Huang still quibbled, saying that although he was examined by a medical examiner in the detention center, he was not tested for opium addiction, and the director of the detention center could be summoned to testify. In order to convince the defendant, the judge summoned the medical examiner, Hou Guang, to the court. Hou testified that when he examined the defendant, the defendant admitted that he was addicted to opium. Judge Wu verified the testimony and sentenced Huang Chengxie to four months in prison and fined him sixty yuan, and the opium smoking paraphernalia was confiscated. The defendant, upon hearing the sentence, stated that he would appeal, and his lawyer requested bail. The court rejected the request, stating that the defendant had another case pending trial and should await the hearing. The police then took Huang to the detention center.</p>
<h3>A Couple Dies Together in a Hotel</h3>
<p>▲The madam obstructs the good deed</p>
<p>▲The farewell letters are sad and express their feelings</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 3:00 PM, a young man and woman checked into the Da Zhonghua Hotel. In the guest registration book, they wrote their names as Li Pingzhi, 23 years old, local. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, the two went out together for dinner, returning at about 8:00 PM with fruit and other items. They turned off the lights and went to bed at about 11:00 PM, instructing the waiter to wake them up at 11:30 AM the next morning. When the waiter knocked on the door at the appointed time yesterday, there was no response for a long time, which aroused suspicion. He managed to climb in through the window and saw the man and woman lying stiff on the bed. He immediately notified the front desk and reported to the police. The Lao Zha police station sent detectives to investigate and found that the man and woman had committed suicide by taking poison. They were immediately taken by car to Renji Hospital, but both had been dead for a long time and could not be saved. They were transferred to the forensic examination office on Fairland Road, awaiting examination today. It was found that the deceased had left three suicide notes before committing suicide. Two business cards were found in the man's pocket, inscribed with Zhao Wenlong, address on Ringlong Road in the French Concession. It was then revealed that Li Pingzhi was his alias. As for the contents of the suicide notes, they were extremely sad. The general idea was that he had lost his wife last year and had occasionally gotten involved with prostitutes. He met Yuying from Qinghe Lane and fell in love at first sight. Because he did not intend to remarry, he wanted to spend his life with Yuying, but Yuying's evil madam made things difficult in every way, so that the good deed was obstructed. There was no way to think. Rather than live a boring life, it was better to die. There was also a bank passbook with 250 yuan to be left to his son Dake. The deceased had a son named Dake, who was only five years old. Yuying also had a suicide note, written by Wenlong on the same piece of paper. The general idea was that since falling into prostitution, she had been mistreated by the madam and had no freedom. She was also suffering from a serious illness, but not only was she not given medical treatment, but she was still forced to receive guests. Her suffering was hard to describe in words. She had no confidants in her life. Since meeting Mr. Zhao, they had loved each other and thought it was a perfect match, and that they would be happy from then on. Who would have thought that the madam was only interested in money and made things difficult in every way. Even after begging and negotiating in every way, it was difficult to fill her desires. In this situation, it was better to die than to live, so she and Mr. Zhao went to the underworld to find happiness. Yuying also had another letter to her younger sister, urging her no matter how poor she was, not to fall into prostitution. The previous car could be used as a reference, do not follow the tragic death of her sister. It is heard that the deceased Zhao Wenlong was from Kunshan, and Yuying was from Wuxi.</p>

<h3>Record of the General Assembly of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Righteous Relief Association</h3>
<p>▲Published the declaration to raise funds for the three provinces of the Righteous Relief Association</p>
<p>▲Passed the articles of association and recommended 17 committee members</p>
<p>The three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei suffered a common disaster. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally went to Hankou to supervise the suppression, the bandit dens of Shangcheng, Guangshan, Gushi, Yingshan, Huoqiu, Liuan, Huoshan, Huang'an, Macheng, Mianyang, and Jianli have been successively recovered. However, in the recovered areas, after burning, killing, and looting, the houses and property were destroyed. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically sent a telegram begging for relief, pleading for the disaster victims in the bandit area. All circles and groups in this city held a temporary righteous relief conference for the disaster areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the auditorium on the second floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. More than 100 people, including Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Du Yuesheng, passed the declaration of simplified regulations, appointed executive and supervisory committee members, and nominated committee members. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Meeting Situation After the ceremony, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Zheng Hongnian, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Wen Lanting were publicly elected as the presidium. Chairman Xu Shiying resolved the following cases: (1) Passed the declaration; (2) The draft of the simplified regulations was declared and passed item by item; (3) This association's location is set at the Renji Shantang on Jinan Road, and a committee for registering executive and supervisory committee members is organized.

<p>▲Passed Declaration Alas, our people have suffered from bandits for a long time. South of Heluo, north of Jianghuai, the cities are burned, the tombs are destroyed, the old and weak are killed, the women are humiliated, the property is completely exhausted, the livelihood is completely cut off, and the people and animals are left with nothing. Alas, who is doing this? Who is causing this? Why do our three provinces suffer from disasters, and thousands of miles of poor people are displaced, suffering and wandering to such an extreme? The poison of the disaster is so fierce that looking back at the past and surveying the world, there has never been such a wide and cruel disaster area as the current Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. General Chiang Kai-shek, with his resolute sincerity, has worked diligently, and in recent months, has successively recovered Shangcheng, Guangshan, Gushi in Henan, Yingshan, Huoqiu, Liuan, Huoshan in Anhui, and Huangcheng, Macheng, Luotian, Mianyang, and Jianli in Hubei, which is also said to be difficult. However, thousands of miles are scarred, and millions are displaced. Who will settle them? Who will comfort them? Although it is said to be the responsibility of the authorities, it is also what benevolent gentlemen cannot bear to sit idly by. The 30th telegram came, and all parties reported, saving the disaster and relieving the difficulty, and righteousness could not be avoided. This is why the like-minded people have the organization of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei disaster area temporary righteous relief association. Who does not want to be good? Taking people out of water and fire and placing them on the mat of honor, who else can we rely on but the elders, fathers, brothers, sisters, and aunts at home and abroad? This is a declaration, please forgive our clumsy expression.</p>
<h3>Features of the Ancient Wood Vibraphone from the Datong Music Society</h3>
<p>Since the Datong Music Society on Songshan Road launched its domestically produced vibraphone, it has been well received by the music industry. In order to promote it, the new products recently launched have improved materials and workmanship compared to the past, and the price is also lower. There is also a specially made ancient wood vibraphone, which is a rare treasure. Its features include three: (1) The raw material is indeed good wood that has been buried in the soil for thousands of years, and the glue has been completely removed, so it will never lose its properties. (2) The tone is beautiful, resonant but not noisy, making people never tire of listening to it. (3) The color is strange and has a special natural charm, making people love it. These three features are all natural and cannot be forced by humans. Compared with the world's most precious and beautiful products, it is not an exaggeration. The association plans to invite Western experts in this field to review and determine the value of this vibraphone. Since only a few have been created, it is feared that supply will not meet demand.</p>

<h3>Director of the Civil Security Bureau to Inspect Subordinate Police Teams</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Director Wen of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau has made great efforts to rectify both internal and external affairs. Yesterday, he issued a circular to all district offices and teams to prepare for inspection. The circular is as follows: "In order to comply with the order, Shanghai is the largest metropolis in our country, strategically located, and connected to both domestic and foreign security administration. Internally, it is related to local peace and security, and externally, it is related to international perception. It is extremely important. This bureau is responsible for public security in the entire city. All departments, offices, and teams under the bureau should be in high spirits, united from top to bottom, and work diligently to build excellent police administration and improve administrative efficiency. Since the director of this bureau took office, he has repeatedly issued clear orders to reform. Now, in order to thoroughly understand the situation of each department and implement rectification, it is planned to stipulate that from the date of this order, each department, office, district office, and team shall conduct serious inspections. The responsible officials of each department should supervise their subordinates to fully prepare.

<h3>British Mail Ship Discovers Epidemic, Navigation Prohibited</h3>
<p>▲ Western attendant suffers from scarlet fever</p>
<p>▲ Detained for more than thirty hours</p>
<p>The British company's regular mail ship, Rajpuanti, arrived in Shanghai from London and was scheduled to sail to Japan yesterday morning. Cargo and passengers had already boarded the ship and were about to depart when it was discovered that a Western attendant on board had suddenly contracted scarlet fever.

<h3>Shanghai Bao Checks Stamp Duty Announcement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bao Stamp Duty Bureau issued an announcement yesterday stating, "According to the regulations of the Stamp Duty Implementation Measures, both persuasion and inspection are implemented to promote the purchase and affixing of stamps by merchants and the public, cultivate a habit of respecting national taxes, and thereby enrich tax revenue and maintain legal interests. This bureau has been ordered to strictly enforce and assess inspections, and must thoroughly rectify. Now, it has been found that the jurisdiction of Shanghai Bao is vast, and the guidance may not be comprehensive. Among various businesses, although most have complied with affixing stamps to documents that should be stamped, there are still instances of trying to be clever and deliberately evading, etc. Furthermore, there are often cases in the market where businesses avoid using invoices that should be issued for business purposes in order to avoid affixing stamps, or use disguised informal notes and receipts, etc., in order to deceive. Such behavior is extremely detrimental to the future of national taxes and has been repeatedly ordered to be banned and should be strictly prohibited in order to maintain tax administration. It is now scheduled to begin inspecting stamps on the 15th of this month, which has been submitted to and approved by the provincial bureau. In addition to sending letters to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and Shanghai Bao County Government ordering the police to assist in handling the matter, this announcement is hereby issued to inform all merchants and the public. All documents such as registers, receipts, and invoices must comply with the regulations and affix stamps accordingly. If, upon inspection at that time, there are omissions or insufficient stamps, or stamps that are not affixed legally, etc., punishment will be imposed according to the law without leniency. Please comply and do not violate this order."</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Employees Donate Salaries to Aid Northeastern Refugees</h3>

However, according to the rules of the factory, double pay is given for working on holidays. Because the party and government organs announced that double pay would not be given, and considering the urgent need to aid the Northeastern refugees, it has been decided to donate one day's salary, which should have been doubled, totaling more than 1,100 yuan, as a donation from all employees of the factory to the Northeastern refugees. It is reported that the funds will soon be sent to the Shanghai charitable organizations and the Northeastern Refugees Relief Joint Association.</p>

<p>Retired soldiers of the 59th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, Li Shuying, Jiang Qingmei, Wang Gancheng, etc., broke into the home of the division commander Zhang Ying at No. 3 Qingfu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, on the 22nd of last month with a handgun, but did not find him.

The case was discovered and the suspects were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, the time for sentencing had arrived. The trial judge Gao Cixun went to the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict.

<h3>Wu Mai's Assault Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>▲ Handled by the Jiangning District Court Procuratorate</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Mai, as a representative of the Student Federation, had previously requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau to guarantee the release of detained students. He had a conflict with the former chief of the Third Section, Wu Zequan, over the request to review the case files, which led to his detention. After being released, Wu Mai sued Mayor Wu, former Director of Public Security Wen, former Chief of the Third Section Wu Zequan, former Chief of the Interrogation Section Ding Jun, and others in the Shanghai District Court for obstructing freedom and causing injury. The District Court Procuratorate repeatedly summoned witnesses but failed to reach a decision. Subsequently, lawyer Wu Mai requested the Jiangsu Higher Court to approve the transfer of jurisdiction over the case. The Higher Court designated the Jiangning District Court to hear the case. A month ago, Prosecutor Wu of the Jiangning District Court came to Shanghai and used the Shanghai District Court to conduct a nearby hearing. Except for Ding Jun, the former chief of the interrogation section, who appeared in court to testify, former Director Wen and former Chief Wu could not be summoned due to other commitments. Yesterday, it was learned that the Municipal Public Security Bureau was notified by the Jiangning District Court Procuratorate that the case in which lawyer Wu Mai sued Mayor Wu and former Director of Public Security Wen for obstructing freedom and causing injury had been investigated by the Procuratorate and a decision had been made not to prosecute. The ruling will be served, and it is hoped that this will be noted, etc.</p>

<h3>A Record of Two Days of Fires</h3>
<p>▲ Many Dead and Injured</p>
<p>▲ Hujia Muqiao: Within the jurisdiction of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, located at Hujia Muqiao, Tianbao Road, and Miaohe Road, there were hundreds of thatched houses, mostly inhabited by rickshaw pullers, vendors, etc. There were over 1,500 people, mostly from northern Jiangsu. At 6:30 pm on October 10th, a fire suddenly broke out carelessly in a thatched house. For a time, the flames soared into the sky and were unstoppable. The cries shook the heavens. The Hujia Muqiao Fire Brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire, and the Zhabei fire brigades also arrived one after another after hearing the report. However, the roads there were narrow, making transportation difficult, and the tap water was barely trickling, which was of no help. By 7:00 pm, the fire became more fierce and spread in all directions. More than 100 thatched houses had been reduced to ashes. Tian Nv, who was escaping, stumbled to the ground with her elderly and young children. When the fire was raging, Wang Sanbao, a young woman from northern Jiangsu, age 22, and Wang Miao, age 20, were unable to escape and were burned to death. Two children, each six or seven years old, were injured. The firefighters worked hard to put out the fire, which was extinguished around 9:00 pm. More than 500 thatched houses were completely destroyed. The injured two children were later taken to Tongren Hospital by their families. The arsonist fled and has not been apprehended.</p>
<p>▲ Meizhou Road: At around 3:00 am the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 44 Yong'an Workshop, Meizhou Road. At that time, the fire was very fierce, and it spread quickly, breaking through the roof in no time. At that time, Ai Xue, a woman from Gaoyou, age 40, her daughter Qiaoying, age 17, and her son Taolin, who was just six months old, who lived on the third floor of the house, were unable to escape and all died in the fire. Ai Chunlong, the husband of the woman, jumped out of the fire and escaped the danger. The fire brigade arrived in time and extinguished the fire. The three bodies were then taken out on the spot, but they were all charred and burnt, making them unbearable to look at. The Yangshupu police station received a report and ordered detectives to investigate. The three bodies were sent to the Fei Lun Road autopsy station by ambulance. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court applied to Prosecutor Zhan Liangce to come to the station with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuzhen to identify the bodies. After confirming the bodies, the case was announced in court. Ai Chunlong testified that he was 46 years old, worked for a living, and that three members of his family had been burned to death. Ai Xue was his wife, and Qiaoying and Taolin were his biological children. They lived on the third floor of the house. When the fire started, it was in the middle of the night, so they were all asleep. The fire started downstairs, so the ladder was burned down first, and only he escaped from the window, etc. Yang Hongyi, Liu Wenbao, and Yang Shangju all said that they worked at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory and did not start the fire, etc. After obtaining the testimony, Mr. Zhan declared that the dead female body Ai Xue, Ai Qiaoying, and the child's body Ai Taolin, etc., were burned to death before their deaths, and the bodies were handed over to Ai Chunlong. The cause of the fire will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with by the police station.</p>
<p>▲ Roberts Road: At around 9:40 am yesterday, a thatched house inhabited by Wei Liu, a woman from northern Jiangsu, in the Xiaonan area of Binlang Road, Roberts Road, Hongkou, was burned down due to carelessness while cooking, leaving behind a fire in the woodpile. Suddenly, thick smoke filled the air and broke through the roof. The fire was fierce due to the wind and spread to the neighbors. In an instant, five thatched houses were reduced to ashes. When the fire brigade arrived after hearing the alarm, the fire had already been extinguished. The old woman Wei Liu was burned on her arms while escaping the fire. The Song police chief of the Sixth District police station went to investigate the area and found that six poor families from northern Jiangsu had been destroyed, with losses of about 500 yuan. The arsonist Wei Liu was arrested and taken to the Sixth District for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wu Kangxin's French Book on the Political Theories of the Spring and Autumn Period</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Kangxin's new French book, "Political Theories of the Spring and Autumn Period" (Les Trois Theories Politiques ou Tehouen Tsieou - literally translated as "Three Political Theories in the Spring and Autumn Annals") concerns Confucius' "Spring and Autumn Annals." In the study of Chinese classics, this book holds a supreme position, and people regard it as the only treasure of Confucius' political philosophy. Mr. Wu's book is based on Dong Zhongshu's original text of "Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals," citing the writings of famous Western scholars, and lists the three major political theories of the Gongyang School of the Spring and Autumn Annals (Three Ages, King Lu, Three Unifications). The beginning of the book is prefaced with the origin and lineage of the Gongyang School, Dong Zhongshu's life, and the greatness of his writings and arguments. The end of the book is appended with the evolution of the Spring and Autumn Annals and commentaries, tracing the source to the end, with detailed and informative research. Scholars in Paris, Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg, and Sweden, London, who have read this book, have praised it as an exceptional work. P. Pelliot, a famous French sinologist, and Professor W.P. Yetts of London wrote to say that the author is a scholar of great value, which shows how highly this book is regarded in European academic circles. The first draft of this book was the author's doctoral dissertation submitted to the University of Paris. After revisions and additions, it was reprinted and published by Libroirie Leroux (one of the most famous bookstores in Paris) in March of this year, priced at 50 francs per copy (approximately 10 yuan in national currency at the current exchange rate). The original book is in French, and there have been proposals to translate it into Spanish, German, English, and Polish. "Le Livre" (a quarterly book review in Paris) places this book in the ranks of first-class masters (such as the works of philosopher H. Bergson and Professor L. Brinschvicg of the University of Paris). The "Bibliographic ed la Hrance" published the title of this book in May of this year. "Chronique des Ecrivains internaticnaux" in Paris sent a letter to solicit the author's photo and biographical information. In addition, the "Journal asiatique" in Paris, which has a history of over a hundred years and specializes in Oriental studies, and "Rappart general," will devote special articles in the next issue to review and introduce this work. "Europe," a magazine in Madrid, the capital of Spain, will translate one or two chapters of this book in the next issue, with commentary, as an introduction. In addition to the publishing house, this book is also sold in the three most famous bookstores in Paris. It is also available in other countries, such as Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg, Hanover, London, and Warsaw. The author stayed in Berlin this spring and talked with several professors there, deeply feeling the necessity of promoting and improving Chinese culture today. Two or three specialists in Paris advised the author to stay in Paris for a long time to take a professorship in a specialized college of the University of Paris. However, the author, feeling that the country is in distress, the culture is declining, and the homeland is in ruins, found it difficult to stand idly by. Therefore, in the summer, he hurried back from London to Paris, and returned to China in early autumn. He arrived in Guangzhou at the end of last month and is now a professor at Zhongshan University, and also temporarily serves as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. It is heard that the author will, at the urging of two or three specialists in Paris, and after the affairs of the Faculty of Arts of Zhongshan University are slightly settled, consider making a European tour again in the autumn of next year, in response to the invitation of the University of Paris, to communicate Chinese and Western culture through lecturing and writing as a lifelong career.</p>

<h3>Population Reports in the Late Qing Dynasty Overstated and Understated Figures</h3>
<p>— ·Jing· Ji</p>
<p>Old Master Xiang sometimes talks about the dark secrets of the current political circles, and he certainly thinks that they need to be improved. However, he also says that, compared to the official governance of the late Qing Dynasty, some situations seem to have improved! Let me record a few things.</p>
<p>1.  Old Master Xiang said: When he was in the Shandong [unclear] Machine Bureau, of course, the local tribute peaches were also distributed two peaches because of the kindness of the local officials. Think about it: Only a few peaches went to the emperor after a tribute, a portion went to the princes, and another went to the governors and supervisors; who knows how many! He initially received only two peaches and felt that the favor was too thin. Fortunately, he met a colleague who knew the value of the goods and taught him how to eat them. After eating more than half of a peach, he felt it was too sweet to swallow any further. At that time, we, who were listening to Old Master Xiang's story, felt that the Longhua peaches in our hands and the Fenghua peaches in the plates had lost much of their flavor! Because everyone was eating peaches at that time, Old Master Xiang talked about peaches!</p>
<p>2.  Old Master Xiang also said that he reported to his superiors at the time that the price of gunpowder raw materials was so much money per jin. He was told that this was too expensive. So he had to think of a way to report again. A staff member said, "Change the jin to a pound." He did as he was told and it was approved. Think about it: Is a jin more or a pound more? Pound is a Western name: The so-called "foreign affairs" were dealt with ambiguously!</p>
<p>3.  Old Master Xiang also talked about an even more interesting thing, which was the annual routine report on the population and households. Usually, they always added a little bit to show the achievements of the local officials. Once there was a famine, they would reduce some: To save some for future increases! Overstating and understating were all official clichés!</p>
<p>Old Master Xiang often advises the younger generation: Don't just admire vanity; don't dream of getting promoted and rich!</p>
<h3>Memories of Twenty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— ·Yi· Wei· Sheng</p>
<p>Twenty-one years ago, on the first Double Tenth Festival of the Republic of China. Everyone still remembers the energetic situation at that time, right? When Shanghai held a lantern parade to celebrate, people from all walks of life and groups participated enthusiastically. A Korean man with the surname Jin joined our ranks. According to people who knew him, Mr. Jin was originally a man who had received higher education, but now he was working as a cook for others. He made a tall banner out of white silk, embroidered with large red characters celebrating the holiday. He personally carried it on his shoulder and requested to participate in the lantern parade as an individual. During the procession, he spoke loudly about the story of his own country's subjugation and said how fortunate it was that the Republic of China had its present day. He was a surviving citizen of a conquered country, and could only look up and admire. He hoped that the Republic of China would become stronger and stronger every day. Then he himself would feel honored to have witnessed today. His words had endless implications, and he wiped away tears as he spoke. He felt that he shouldn't be crying today, so he bitterly smiled and explained, "I'm just so happy that I'm crying." However, many of the people in the procession and the spectators along the way also shed tears with him. At the time, after listening to his words, I thought to myself, "We will one day be able to save them from this hellish situation, right? This is our first commemorative holiday, and it is also the beginning of our establishing ourselves and helping others. Won't we be able to achieve our goal after three or five years?" I secretly promised him this in my heart, though I didn't say it out loud. But, later, year after year passed, and now, it has been twenty-one years, and the reality seems to be getting farther and farther away from my goal at that time. Mr. Jin, I don't know where he is now. If I were to see him, I wouldn't know what to say to him. But, I believe my goal still exists. Compatriots, come together, let's create a glorious new era that we should have. When that time comes, regardless of whether Mr. Jin is alive or dead, we can say to him or to his spirit, "Mr. Jin, look, you don't have to be sad anymore!"</p>
<h3>"Double Tenth Festival" Comedy</h3>
<p>— ·Yan· Chong· Lou</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, we were very enthusiastic about preparing for the celebration of that year's Double Tenth Festival. We held a National Day Fun Fair at home, inviting relatives and friends to participate. My father specially wrote a comedy for us, entitled "Double Tenth Festival". The general idea of this play is: "A stingy landlord invites his poor and sour old scholar to a restaurant for a drink on October 10th. Both of these gentlemen observe the abolished calendar, so of course they don't know what is called the "Double Tenth Festival". While drinking, they agree to play a drinking game. Their drinking game is "Whoever can say a holiday with the same month and day number can have a drink." So the landlord said first: "January 1st is New Year's Day." (Drink) The scholar said: "February 2nd, the dragon raises its head." (Drink) The landlord said: "March 3rd is Shangsi." (Drink) The scholar said: "April 4th..." The landlord said: "April 4th is not a holiday, you can't drink"! Then the landlord said "May 5th" (Dragon Boat Festival) "July 7th" (Double Seventh Festival) "September 9th" (Double Ninth Festival) are all holidays, the scholar said "June 6th" "August 8th" "October 10th", the landlord said that these are not holidays, and the scholar began to shout loudly, saying "I still drank on February 2nd"! They argued endlessly because of this. The people at the next table asked about the reason for their dispute and were surprised that they didn't even know that October 10th was National Day, so they explained to them the origin and value of the Double Tenth Festival. Now they both understood! They finally ceased the dispute and celebrated the Double Tenth Festival." This comedy ended here. In this play, I played the poor and sour old scholar, and my funny performance won the laughter of the whole audience.</p>
<p>Now times have changed, and the motherland has been deeply wounded. In the Double Tenth Festival, we no longer have the joy of performing a play. In our hearts, we only feel the sorrow of the national crisis!</p>
<h3>A Few Words on National Day</h3>
<p>— ·Tu· Shou· Zhuo</p>
<p>Time flies, and the Double Tenth Festival has come again. This year is Ren Shen. The year of the Wuchang Uprising was Xin Hai. The establishment of the Republic of China was exactly twenty full years ago. This double-double tenth National Day should be celebrated with pomp and ceremony. However, the lost land has not yet been recovered, enemy goods are still rampant, the disaster in Lu is not over, and the chaos in Sichuan has started again. The government's finances have few solutions, and social morality is even more depraved. In reality, there is no time for mourning, so what is there to celebrate? Only failure is the mother of success, and everything in the world depends on human effort. There is a Wu saying: "Regardless of three times seven is twenty-one." Today, the good twenty-one years of the Republic of China have passed eight or nine tenths in disregard. The past cannot be admonished, but the future can be pursued. I only hope that from now on, both the government and the public will no longer repeat the mistakes of procrastination and inaction, but will work together with one heart and one mind to overcome the national crisis, cultivate vitality, and eliminate war. Then we can have a value of celebrating warmly at the twenty-second National Day and at countless National Days.</p>
<h3>National Day Under the Iron Heel</h3>
<p>— ·Jie·Sheng</p>
<p>"Gui'er: Is today the tenth of October, National Day?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Papa."</p>
<p>"Go… it's getting late. Close the front door and move a table and incense burner to the backyard."</p>
<p>Ji Zhongyuan, his face full of sorrow, walked back and forth with his hands behind his back in the dimly lit small room. From the wrinkles on his face and his sad brow, one could tell he was deep in an abyss of distress!</p>
<p>Gui'er closed the front door. Incense burner, table, one by one he moved them to the backyard and placed them properly. Ji Zhongyuan entered the backyard, stretched out a pair of wrinkled hands, lit a stick of incense, and mumbled something in prayer.</p>
<p>"Ah! Gui'er!" He suddenly felt something, pointing to the corner of the wall, he said to his son in a trembling voice, "Dig out that national flag that was buried last year and put it on the table."</p>
<p>Gui'er bent down and dug out a wooden box. He opened it, took out a Qing Tian Bai Ri (Blue Sky White Sun) flag, looked at it in the light of the incense, and exclaimed in surprise, "Papa: This flag has changed color!"</p>
<p>Ji Zhongyuan seemed to be shaken by an earthquake, his body involuntarily trembling; his haggard face was already deeply buried in hot tears.</p>
<p>Boom… Boom… Boom… Bang… Bang… Bang… Suddenly, a burst of gunshots and artillery fire erupted in the air! Dogs in the surrounding villages barked frantically like madmen! Gui'er panicked and hid under the table. Ji Zhongyuan, as if nothing had happened, remained with his head buried, praying.</p>
<p>"Papa: Someone… is… climbing… the wall…" Gui'er poked his head out from under the table. In the darkness, there seemed to be several figures climbing over the wall. He faintly heard the sound of crumbling wall soil. His little heart beat anxiously. From under the table, he tugged at his father's sleeve, calling out in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Don't make a sound!" A person in military attire, already at the table, raised a gun; followed by three, four, five… "You… you… you… are…" Ji Zhongyuan was extremely panicked and quickly grabbed the national flag, trembling, and asked.</p>
<p>"We are volunteer soldiers, sir, don't be afraid! Everyone agreed to attack on National Day, but we didn't know the Japanese devils were prepared, and we were almost surrounded! Don't make a sound… What is that in your hand?" A tall figure said.</p>
<p>"Ah! Brave men…" Ji Zhongyuan was now extremely happy, and said in a low voice, "This is the national flag, the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Put it on the table, put out the incense! Let everyone kneel down and commemorate the motherland!" A figure with a saber knelt down first. Gui'er crawled out from under the table, took the national flag, and spread it flat on the table. The crowd all knelt down.</p>
<p>Boom… Boom… Bang bang bang… The sound of gunfire and artillery from all sides became more and more intense, and umbrella-like red lights danced incessantly in the dark sky! They forgot the terror and the angry waves, forgot themselves, forgot everything… In this deep courtyard under fire, they still buried their heads and silently prayed.</p>
<h3>Companion Postmen at the Pass (9)</h3>
<p>— ·Qiu·Xing·Fu·Zhai·Zhu</p>
<p>This day happened to be the first day after the Beginning of Autumn. Yesterday was still so scorching hot. Since the beginning of xushi (7-9 PM) last night when Autumn began, followed by a rain that fell around 2 AM, the rain master calmly did its work all night, washing away all the heat that had been steaming up from the earth since the recent summer days. By dawn, the golden wind was blowing, and the jade dew was producing coolness, instantly weaving a day of autumnal atmosphere. Although the rain had stopped, the white sun still shone brightly in the sky, but the sunlight was no longer as scorching as yesterday. The autumn wind was also spreading coolness everywhere in gusts. In just one night, the human world had unknowingly transformed into a cool autumn world.</p>
<p>This led the many tourists, taking advantage of their weekend leisure, to relax and open their hearts, vying to admire the first scene of seasonal autumn scenery newly spread across the Wanquan River. Only this young man and woman had not come to appreciate the autumn; in each of their hearts, some of the lingering heat of anxiety accumulated from yesterday was still hidden, and they did not feel the pleasure of the autumn light.</p>
<p>Lu Boqin pondered bitterly all night. By morning, he became unbearably irritable. He was the first to arrive, finding a stone drum under a melon trellis at a key intersection to sit down, holding his head, still lost in thought, waiting for his beloved to appear. Tong Yizhen was entangled with some family matters, and after breakfast, she had to do some extra combing and dressing, so naturally she was a bit late, not arriving until after 10 AM in a hurry.</p>
<p>When he raised his burning, heavy head, propped up his weary eyes, dulled by sleeplessness, and gazed intently at his smiling, graceful beloved standing before him, he suddenly felt countless dazzling beams of light flashing and swirling in his eyes, experiencing an extraordinary sense of dizziness. He felt strangely surprised, saying: "Huh! How has Yizhen's appearance changed so much today! Yet she has become so much better!"</p>
<p>It turned out that Yizhen had come in full dress today. Her fragrant hair had been meticulously permed with hot tongs, fluffy and vibrant, like a layer of clouds piled up. Having always disliked makeup, she had exceptionally applied a thin layer of rouge and powder, and had also drawn two long, movie-star-style eyebrows, the curves of which fluttered slightly, complementing her beautiful appearance, truly like a living, fragrant flower bud just beginning to bloom. She had also completely changed her attire, putting on a new, onion-green Indian silk cheongsam, a pair of pink silk stockings and white alum-cloth high-heeled leather shoes, and holding up a lake-colored silk umbrella, all of which exuded an air of nobility, different from the beauty of a small family's jade girl that was usually seen. In addition, with the colorful and vibrant famous garden as her backdrop, she was even more graceful and ethereal, like an angel in a painting.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Bankers Come to Shanghai for Long-Term Inquiries</h3>
<p>The Long-Term News and Transaction Status of the Second Half of This Year Are Not as Prosperous as Last Year. However, the Inflows and Outflows of Old Accounts Still Exist. For Example, in the Ningbo Area, the Total Amount of Loans Released in Shanghai in Previous Years Suddenly Stopped at Tens of Millions. Furthermore, All of the First Half of the Year Were Transferred Without Collection, So There Should Be Some Contact When It Expires This Time, Either Collection or Release, Which Will Generally Be Determined by the General Commercial Trend. According to News Released by the Money Shop, the Total Amount of Ningbo Loans Released in Shanghai Is Still 13-14 Million. The Outcome of This Period May Be That All of It Needs to Be Transferred. It Is Also Unpredictable. Let's Wait for the Ningbo Loan Bankers to Arrive in Shanghai Before Determining What to Do. It Was Reported That Four or Five Ningbo Bankers Had Already Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Bearing the Mission of Releasing Loans, Which Accounted for More Than Half of the Total Amount. After Interviewing the Reporter, They Were Told That the Situation in Shanghai This Year Was Not Good. If They Could Collect It, It Would Be Best. However, the Situation Is Not as Familiar as in Previous Years, So It Is Feared That Collection Will Be Difficult. In Our Opinion, It Is More Beneficial to Transfer It. We Will Also Determine It Based on the General Trend of the Market. It Is Generally Reasonable to Transfer It. However, Four-Five Million That Should Have Been Cleared After Three Times of Comparison on the Previous Day Were Delayed by One Day Until Yesterday Due to the Double Tenth Festival Holiday. It Is Estimated That More Were Transferred and Very Few Were Collected, It Is Said.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Stomach Removal of Foreign Use</h3>
<p>The Biggest Reason for the Surge in Northern Foreign Li Is Purely the Impact of the Smooth Stomach Removal of Customer Routes. According to the Investigation in the Middle of This Month, the Total Amount Loaded from Various Ports Has Reached More Than Tens of Millions, Including (1) Hankou Loaded the Most, Amounting to More Than 4.3 Million, (2) Tianjin 2.5 Million, (3) Xiamen and Shantou 2.23 Million, (4) Guangzhou Initially Loaded More Than 1 Million, and Recently, Loading to No Less Than 3 Million, Which Is About 2 Million, (5) Ningbo Loaded 1.23 Million, (6) Tongzhou 1.56 Million, (7) Tin Chang and Jiahu and Other Rice Payments Accounted for 7-8 Million. Those Loaded Today Are Not Yet Included, It Is Said.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>20 Volume of Consolidated Salt Tax Drops to One Yuan</p>
<p>November Futures Have Been Mostly Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday (11th), the Shanghai Chinese Business Securities Exchange's Various Bond Market Situations, Many Spot Goods Were Opened, with a Total Transaction Volume of 40,000 Yuan, Including 16,000 Yuan of 19 Customs and 11,000 Yuan of Salt Tax. The Rest Were Only a Few Thousand Yuan. The Futures Market Was Quiet in the Morning, Still Only Trading in the October Period, with a Transaction Volume of Just Over One Million Yuan. However, the Market Was Active in the Afternoon as Prices Continued to Fall, So the Inflows and Outflows from All Sides Were More Active Than Before, and the November Futures, Which Had Been Open for a Long Time, Had Mostly Begun to Trade. However, There Were Actually Only a Few Transaction Statistics, with a Total Transaction Volume of 3.5 Million Yuan, of Which Salt Tax Accounted for 710,000, and the Consolidated Tax 20 Volume of Customs Each Accounted for About 500,000 Yuan. The Initial Fluctuations in the Morning Were Extremely Small, with Little Change Compared to the Previous Weekend. However, the Market Was Weak and Sellers from All Sides Were Actively Selling, Falling One After Another. The Afternoon Opening Was the Lowest, with Fluctuations of More Than One Yuan Before and After. As a Result, It Fell by Six-Seven Jiao to More Than One Yuan Compared to Last Week. This Was Because There Were Many Accidents and Disputes in the Country, and the Diplomatic Situation Also Lacked a Turning Point, So the General Public Was Pessimistic.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Plunges</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report, Monday (10th), the New York Stock Market, Because the Unfilled Orders of the United States Steel Company Were Not as Good as Predicted, Were Enthusiastically Dumped, and All Stocks Fell in Unison. Later, Someone Maintained Gold and Silver, and the Market Situation Was Slightly Better, But the Stock Market Still Lacked People to Support It, and the Public Felt Disappointed. Therefore, the Falling Trend Started Again at the Closing, and the Tragic Fall Was Even Worse. Trading Was Unusually Active When It Fell. According to Statistics, the Total Number of Transactions Throughout the Day Was 2.3 Million Shares. According to the Dow Jones 30 Industrial Stock Index, It Has Fallen a Total of 13 Yuan in the Past 5 Days, So the Market Has Reacted, But Considering the Relationship Between the Political Situation, the Failure of Prices, and the Slow Recovery of Industry and Commerce, It Seems Difficult to Rise Suddenly in the Shortest Period. The Dow Jones Index Is Listed on the Left:</p>
<p>Closing Price, Compared to, Compared to, Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 58.47 Fell 2.70 20 Railroad Stocks 23.65 Fell 2.31 20 Utility Stocks 25.51 Fell 1.79 40 Bonds 79.42 Fell 0.72</p>
<h3>The Selling Momentum in the Cotton Yarn Market Is Strong Again</h3>
<p>The Enduring Long-Term Cotton Yarn Market, the Third Estimate of American Cotton Has Increased Again, and the Market Price Has Fallen More Than 40 Pounds. Now That This Promotion Is Obtained, the Selling Momentum Is Even Stronger. The General Retail Investors Endured the Pain to End the Market, and the Market Fell Sharply, But the Bottom Has Dried Up, and There Are Few New Dumpers, So the Falling Trend Is Not Yet Violent. Second, the Bullish Rongxing Has Not Yet Come Out of the Cage. However, the Current Yarn Demand in the Market Is Still Stagnant. Some of the Bulls Were Settled in the Afternoon, and the Market Was Even More Tired, It Is Said.</p>
<p>▲People Mark San Duo Ends. Before the Market Opened, the Market Was Weak Due to the Downward Trend of American Cotton. People Mark San Duo Ended. Each Month Fell One-Two Mace. The Market Was Tired Again in the Afternoon. Each Month Fell Four-Five Mace Again. The Transaction Volume Was 37,600 Bales. Checking the Sales, Jifeng Was 1,250 Bales, Dachang Was 1,000 Bales, Xing Was 1,150 Bales, Tianlong Was 600 Bales, and Shenji Was 1,500 Bales. Gengfeng Bought 650 Bales, Yuda Bought 900 Bales, Mingde Bought 850 Bales, Hengde Bought 1,000 Bales, and Hengchang Bought 850 Bales. The Closing Price Is Listed Below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Dumping Increases Daily</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending downward because estimates for American cotton have increased by another 115,000 bales, causing buyers to be somewhat disappointed. Moreover, the recent favorable weather in the country is conducive to the listing of new cotton. All these factors are beneficial to short sellers, so the sellers' momentum is getting stronger, and the amount of dumping is increasing daily. Generally, scattered short positions view the environment as unfavorable and are closing out positions slightly. Various spot cotton factories in the market have no intention to act, so spot cotton business is relatively quiet. All months have fallen below the two tael mark.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao for All Months Have Fallen by About Half a Tael. In the opening of the Zheng Biao market, due to the weakness of foreign cotton, the selling pressure was intense, and major players took advantage of the situation to chase and continue dumping additional positions. All months fell by four or five qian. In the afternoon, it fell another five fen to one or two qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 85,700 dan. The sales volume for Jifeng was 3,800 dan, Hengyi 2,200 dan, Gengfeng 5,100 dan, Shenji 2,500 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Xincheng 4,200 dan, Rongxing 2,700 dan, and Tongxing 4,800 dan. The purchases were Hengde 2,500 dan, Xiesheng 2,500 dan, Xinheng 2,000 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, and Yu Chang 3,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao　Closing Price Increase/Decrease　Inventory Number</p>
<p>One Three Five Five　Down 55　395,000</p>
<p>October Three One Seven Five　Down 45　140,500</p>

<p>December Three One Five Zero　Down 55　244,400</p>
<p>Total 1,138,600</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Mills' Demand is Quiet, and Spot Cotton Business Feels More Sluggish. In addition, yarn sales are dismal and pessimistic. All factories are at a standstill. The source is estimated to be 1,670 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 32.25, Yufeng Entered 500 Bales, Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Wusong Cotton 30.25, Zhenhua Entered 500 Bales, Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Taicang Cotton 30.25, Maojin Entered 200 Bales, Sent to Factory</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Varies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm initially due to foreign merchants buying, but later it weakened due to the downturn in Wall Street and reactive selling. Futures prices fluctuated by two points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose three points, spot prices fell thirty-two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell twenty-five points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (October 10 telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain: Sluggish Sales in the Shanghai Rice Market</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the source of supply to South Shanghai was still surging, with about fifty businesses. Sales on this street were extremely sluggish. The prices of Yaozhong, Baige, and New Japonica rice all fell by half a yuan. The buying interest was extremely quiet, and market participants are generally expecting prices to fall further. The situation is particularly weak. Although there is not much aged and broken rice from Chen's hulling operations, transactions are very slack, and prices are also short by two jiao. There is no increase or decrease in foreign Dujian rice.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday morning, the number of people at the Xinzha market was very few. Changshu Chen's rice was soft by one jiao. Zhongguan followed and fell by two or three jiao. The sales of new rice from Kunshan and Jiangyin were even more stagnant, falling by four or five jiao. New thin rice from Shipu, Jiaoli, Sijing, Tinglin, Zhangyan, and other places arrived, but sales were weak, and inventories were still abundant. The asking price fell by three jiao. There were some sporadic sales of foreign-tipped, wharf-tipped, and wild rice tips. The situation is stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice: Sluggish Local Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local appetite for foreign rice was very sluggish. Customers from the Northern and Central gangs have some intention of trying to do business, but the limited price range prevents any agreement from being reached. There were new He Xia tips on the market on this street, but there was no interest in buying them. The total market sales yesterday only included 300 bags of Saigon No. 1, priced at 9 yuan, 2 jiao, and 7 fen to 1 jiao and 2 fen, which were handled by this street. The market is similar to the previous market. Because Saigon's inventory is very low and later arrivals are absent, the cargo owners are unwilling to let go easily. Small Jiao rice is weak and difficult to sell.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Inverted Near-Far Spread</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, both the upper and lower markets saw a good opening for near-term contracts, while far-term contracts saw a decline. The inverted market situation has been established. The closing results also showed an increase in the near-term and a decline in the far-term. The near-term was supported by spot flour, and there were customers inquiring, so the market gradually improved. The far-term was affected by foreign wheat, and various factories were actively hedging, so the market was sluggish. As a result, the next month increased by one fen, December increased by two and a half li, January decreased by two and a half li, February decreased by seven and a half li, and March decreased by half a fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market: Weak, Especially Far-Term Contracts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was generally weak. Because there is a large inventory of spot wheat in the north, it will be shipped before the American wheat arrives in Shanghai. Yesterday, more than 10,000 bags arrived, so market sentiment was very soft, and hedging was particularly strong. The far-term was even weaker. The closing price for March was more than five fen lower, October was only one fen lower, November was two fen lower, December to February were each three fen lower. More than 10,000 bags of newly arrived spot wheat were handled by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Huafeng, selling 6,000 bags. The selling price of Xu wheat was 3 liang, 4 qian, 7 or 8 fen, Dali wheat was 3 liang and 5 qian, Liuhe wheat was 3 liang and 4 qian, Nanjing was 3 liang and 3 qian, 8 fen, Yangzhou was 3 liang and 4 qian, 5 fen, Anting was 3 liang and 2 qian, 5 fen, and Shaoxing wheat was 3 liang, 3 qian, and 3 fen. The price for second-grade wheat was reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Monday (the 10th), Chicago wheat initially rose due to the strength of corn, but later fell due to poor foreign demand. As a result, each contract was down one fen compared to the previous day. The trading volume on the 8th was a total of 30 million bushels. The market prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December Contract 48.625　Down 1.00</p>
<p>May Contract 53.750　Down 1.00</p>
<p>July Contract 54.875　Down 1.00</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: Silk Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was calm. The European and American markets were relentlessly competing in silk sales, and silk prices were getting lower and lower. There were no overseas silk telegrams to Shanghai for business. Wuxi silk mills are experiencing labor unrest again, and market sentiment is quiet. Yesterday, only Dachang entered 20 packages of Grade B top-grade 13-15 filament Lu Huang factory silk, priced at 600 taels. Zhonghe entered 20 packages of upper-grade second-grade eight-cocoon gray silk, priced at 331 taels.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Native Silk Prices Reported Higher</h3>
<p>Recently, inland silk weaving factories have started weaving winter silk, and the demand for native silk has turned active. Silk prices have been reported higher. The current market price for excellent-grade fine silk is 42 yuan per 100 taels, and the price for fat silk is 30 yuan, an increase of four or five yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea Transactions Still Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Gongxi green tea from Yuantunxi, Yushan, Wenzhou, and other routes was of great interest to the Russian firm Xie Yizhai and the Baitou firms Ruichang and Yulong. More than 1,000 boxes were traded throughout the city. Although the selling price was low, there was no increase or decrease. There were also some scattered transactions in needle-like and show-like teas. However, ordinary Zhenmei tea remained sluggish. Although Chinese tea merchants reluctantly reduced prices to seek sales, there were very few responses to the large number of telegrams sent recently, and the prospects are extremely worrying.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: The Asking Price for Sun-Dried Longan Meat is Stable</h3>
<p>There have not been many recent arrivals of Tong'an sun-dried longan meat, and market prices have stabilized. It has been found that the total number of arrivals before and after is only a few hundred boxes. It was heard yesterday that they have all been sold, priced at 29 taels. The trend is still stable. The previous asking price for wharf sun-dried meat reached a maximum of over 50 taels. Due to successive arrivals, the price has gradually decreased. Retail sales are only 40 taels. It was heard yesterday that the supplier had another shipment arriving. The inquiry price is still 40 taels, but the Shanghai market is sluggish, and it is feared that prices will have to be lowered again.</p>
<h3>Shandong Peanut Market Prices Are Falling Daily</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Peanut kernels have always been a major export commodity of this province. This year, due to overproduction and sluggish demand from foreign merchants and the Guangdong gang, market prices are declining daily. Native produce merchants are generally experiencing great panic. (Telegram of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Transactions Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the white coal market gradually improved. 380 tons of MacKay coal screening blocks were sold, and the price was good by one qian, at 18 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen per ton. A significant amount of Liujiang coal blocks were purchased by fellow merchants in this street, priced at 13 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen for the head, and 12 taels for No. 2. In addition, a considerable amount of lower-grade Hongqi coal was purchased by various shops, priced at 13 taels and 5 qian.</p>

<h3>A Conversation on Double Ten Day</h3>
<p>— ·Fo</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the Double Ten National Day. Because of my festering foot, walking was difficult, so I stayed at home. I have been staying home for many days. This National Day anniversary, naturally, I did not enjoy any rights, only "closed-door contemplation." I sat quietly for a whole day. I thought of the shouts on the street, "Good feet and good hands to paradise, blind eyes to the gates of hell." Today, I finally tasted some of that flavor. Several gentlemen with light feet and hands must have gone out for a stroll, to air out the accumulated national spirit of the year, or talked with friends about the "laughable and sad" national crisis, or talked nonsense, discussing the meridians of national salvation. I think it's the usual sour state of the general long-robed comrades, right?</p>
<p>But the national government bigwigs will certainly not be as free as we are. The other day, the central government ordered that National Day should be business as usual, with celebrations suspended. I think national government bigwigs have more leisure than we do at times of leisure, and less leisure than we do at times of non-leisure. On such a National Day, others leisurely play as they please, while the general bigwigs not only work as usual, but also work harder. It's truly the so-called "eating public grain and carrying a gun." Now that the serious national crisis is weighing on their heads, these gentlemen who eat the government's rice, I am afraid, also have a hard time in their hearts.</p>
<p>Two honest friends said that the government has been working harder for more than a year, but they cannot find any benefits or results of the work. The national crisis remains a national crisis, the lost territory remains lost territory, and the civil war remains a civil war. Rather than working without making the slightest contribution to resolving the national crisis, even just clinging to Buddha's feet for one day of National Day is useless. It is better to be happy for one day, and at most, to be resigned to fate, preparing to enjoy the taste of being a slave of a conquered nation. To expose the magic lantern, in any case, it is not well done, so why bother doing it again?</p>
<p>But I think that the gentlemen who eat the nation's rice, do the nation's business, bear the nation's responsibility, and enjoy the nation's blessings will never say such things. No matter how short the rope is for drawing water from a deep well, or how helpless they feel, a "loving what the world disdains to love, rejoicing in what the world delays to enjoy" attitude must be revealed to the world. Fortunately, the so-called business as usual is only for the third, fourth, and fifth-class bigwigs. As for the first and second-class bigwigs, there is originally no work to speak of.</p>
<p>"Fatalism" is our great national policy, and "doing one's best and awaiting destiny" is also the attitude we should take in life. The saying "Man can conquer nature" is originally to deceive people. The survival of the nation is originally a matter of destiny. Whether it is done well or not has nothing to do with us. Moreover, the survival of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. Such a large country is not something that a few bigwigs can bear. "Many citizens" should also be jointly responsible.</p>
<p>Or some say, "Normally, officials are allowed to set fires, but common people are not allowed to light lamps." When disaster strikes, the common people naturally cannot be held responsible. We originally do not understand the meaning of Sun Yat-sen's so-called "people's rights," nor do we understand the meaning of so-called popular sovereignty. We only know to work when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets. What does the affairs of the nation have to do with us?</p>
<p>The above is what I talked about with a few old women next door yesterday. I have jotted it down in a haphazard manner to provide information for this port.</p>

<h3>Reflecting on the Times, Following the Rhymes of Du Fu's "Autumn Thoughts"</h3>
<p>— ·Jin·Ai·Shi</p>
<p>Rustling fallen leaves evoke the autumn forest,</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the northern borderlands is grim.</p>
<p>A perilous environment where swallows nest on a crumbling curtain,</p>
<p>A powerful neighbor watches like a tiger, plotting schemes in the shadows.</p>
<p>Righteous indignation to eliminate traitors, Tian Heng's courage,</p>
<p>Bearing the grudge of Xuechi, Goujian's heart remains.</p>
<p>Brave warriors are willing to sacrifice themselves for the country,</p>
<p>Garments of war washed with blood fill the frosted whetstone.</p>
<p>Gazing afar at the setting sun over the old capital,</p>
<p>Rouge embellishes the north, still flourishing.</p>
<p>Generals drunkenly dance like butterflies before flowers,</p>
<p>Envoys drift aimlessly overseas like rafts.</p>
<p>Vast ocean becomes a boiling cauldron,</p>
<p>Rainy winds fill the city with mournful trumpets.</p>
<p>Eager students weep at the Qin court,</p>
<p>Hot tears only splash on the waves in vain.</p>
<p>Reports of victory on the red flag have been delayed for long,</p>
<p>How can one compete and grasp the ephemeral gains and losses?</p>
<p>Officials sink and float in the sea of officialdom,</p>
<p>Political changes rise and fall like magpies flying south.</p>
<p>The situation has become like the three-way division of the Han tripod,</p>
<p>The plans constructed are like the ten times contrary Qin letters.</p>
<p>For long, the copper camels remain among the thorns,</p>
<p>Thinking of home, one envies the fattened donkeys in vain.</p>
<p>Broken rivers and mountains, a chess game after the calamity,</p>
<p>How pitiful, remaining grief on scorched earth.</p>
<p>Blood flows across the land, forming ditches,</p>
<p>Beacon fires rise to the sky, opposing armies facing off in times.</p>
<p>A hair's breadth away, a thousand jun, urging messages in haste.</p>
<p>Isolated army fights a hundred battles, reinforcements are delayed.</p>
<p>Fearing the same fate as an overturned nest, no eggs remain intact,</p>
<p>Royal plans of partial peace are full of cunning thoughts. (Rewarding)</p>

<h3>How to Disinfect</h3>
<p>— ·Ke·Quan</p>
<p>Bacteria are a type of microorganism. Their bodies are very small and cannot be seen without a microscope. Not only are they toxic, but they also have great reproductive power. If the environment is suitable, one can quickly divide into tens of millions. If our bodies are parasitized by these bacteria, if we do not quickly treat them and allow them to produce toxins, we will not only be unable to live, but we will also transmit them to others, causing a major epidemic. This is how dangerous it is.</p>
<p>The bodies of people suffering from infectious diseases have bacteria parasitizing them in various parts. Therefore, the phlegm, saliva, sweat, and feces excreted from the body often contain bacteria. If phlegm or saliva is spat arbitrarily on the ground, it will turn into fine dust and be inhaled into the lungs of others; or if one touches a patient's sweat and then eats food; or if the feces of a patient are used to water vegetables, which are later taken as food, these bacteria will be transmitted. Since bacteria are so easily transmitted, the bacteria in the patient's excrement and the patient's clothing and utensils must be killed to prevent transmission. This killing is called disinfection.</p>
<p>There are various methods of disinfection. There are about three simple and easy-to-implement methods:</p>
<p>(1) Boiling Disinfection| This method of disinfection only requires placing the patient's clothes, cups, plates, etc. in boiling water first, then adding a little sodium bicarbonate, and then boiling for thirty minutes. It can then be taken out. Although the cost is low, the effectiveness is great. It is the most suitable method of disinfection.</p>
<p>(2) Carbolic Acid Disinfection| This method of disinfection is to use five parts of crystalline carbolic acid and ninety-five parts of hot water, stir them together to dissolve, and it becomes carbolic acid water. Then sprinkle the carbolic acid water on the patient's room, utensils, and excrement, or wash the patient's clothes, cups, plates, and other items in carbolic acid water, all of which can disinfect.</p>
<p>(3) Lime Disinfection| This method of disinfection is to mix one part of finely crushed lime powder with four parts of water, then stir to make lime milk, and then sprinkle this lime milk on the patient's feces and saliva, which can also disinfect.</p>

<h3>My Views on Reading "The Standards of the New Family"</h3>
<p>— ·Wang·Ming·Xing</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I read Mr. Zhu Yunzong's great work in Shen Bao and was deeply moved. I respectfully present a single view for readers' amusement.</p>
<p>The reason why Chinese society is bad and called all evil is not in the family, according to my humble opinion. The first reason is that the government cannot enable the people to settle down and solve the people's livelihood problems. The second is that the people are uneven in quality as individual units.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Just look at our country's officials, chanting the high-pitched tune of tutelary rule. In addition to making ordinary innocent children learn the loud calls of shrewish street cursing and the slogan "Down with imperialism," they have not raised the intelligence of the people. There is no grand plan to enrich the country and strengthen the people. How can there be ignorant fools? Not only is the school an exclusive privilege of the propertied class, but even entering a national elementary school is not possible for a family that is not well-off. Moreover, private schools are abolished, but they cannot be replaced by universal rural education. Is this not a policy that is foolish to the poor people? In the imperial examination era, there were occasionally good stories of "street beggars becoming top scholars." Now that the so-called Republic of China, which overthrew class concepts, has been established, the opportunity for beggars to receive education has become an impossible dream. If you want to improve society and improve the general knowledge of the common people, isn't that like trying to make a small piece of wood higher than a tall building? Seeking the root is a policy of giving up the root? However, this is a major plan of the national government, not something that powerless commoners like me dare to speak recklessly about.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People have been implemented for five years (?). Not to mention that democracy and nationalism have not been effective, but even in terms of people's livelihood, unemployment is increasing, and finance is in crisis. People who are poor, hungry, and cold are not reluctant to take risks. The number of people who take risks is increasing, and all evils in society are getting worse. This is still related to the urgent tasks of the country and has nothing to do with the family. Therefore, the second reason I mentioned is actually no different from the first reason.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Zhu's great work, which takes the standards of the new family as the title, I think it is very wrong. If the standard of improving the family is only for wealthy families, then it is almost possible. People's desires are endless. Who would not want high-rise buildings, gardens, and cars to enjoy the pleasures of the world? However, in urban areas, every inch of land is worth a lot of gold. It is not possible to find a more comfortable pigeon cage house, so how can there be Mr. Zhu's magnificent design?</p>
<p>However, wealthy people with huge assets have no need to improve their families. Their children enter universities, study in Europe and the United States, and have savings accumulated in foreign banks. Their diet is hygienic, and so on. They have everything they need and do not need to be told. As for thrift, it is impossible. Even if people advise them, they will definitely not change. On the contrary, if every wealthy person is thrifty, it will also have an impact on business. Moreover, there are only a few million of these people in China. Even if everyone follows what Mr. Zhu said, it is not enough to reform society.</p>
<p>In short, if Mr. Zhu is talking about general families, then today, there are not many Chinese people who are seeking adequate food and clothing, let alone keeping concubines and maids? According to the old Chinese morality and the current economic depression, in addition to husband and wife and children, it is really necessary to support parents. The saying that raising children is to prevent old age is not a clear lesson, but in fact, it has to be so. As for adult brothers and sisters not living together, I don't know what the standard for adulthood is, so I won't discuss it. Saving and insurance are known to everyone today, and there are those who cannot keep warm with clothes and cannot eat enough. In fact, there is the possible. The employment problem is particularly difficult to solve. In an era of too many monks and too little porridge, eating is not easy, and even a small salary is difficult. The so-called direct profit-making and beneficial masses are really too busy to take care of it. If the home is far from the market, there are many inconveniences for work. Without telephones and cars, there are many difficulties. Libraries and sports fields are not something that people in ordinary families dare to dream of. As for the rest, such as autonomous marriage, having ordinary medical knowledge, saving consumption, and eliminating bad habits, I believe that Mr. Zhu's clear views are what ordinary people should adopt.</p>
<p>I dare not agree with Mr. Zhu's listing of smoking as a bad habit. I will discuss it in detail another day.</p>
<p>In terms of the current social situation, it is necessary to renovate the homes of the middle and lower classes, but most of them are trying to barely support their lives, and renovations are also beyond their means.</p>
<p>I believe that the majority of the responsibility should rest with the government. The only plan now is to implement Sun Yat-sen's words, control the people's property, nationalize large capital, equalize land rights, prohibit children from inheriting, confiscate inheritance for public undertakings, create national rural education, establish public libraries and sports fields everywhere, and develop the interior. This alone is enough.</p>
<p>Since this column is for an improved society discussion group, I have often spoken off-topic, and I believe that in the current situation, families cannot be improved perfectly. If the government does not implement strategies, wealthy households will not be willing to do their best for public affairs, and poor households are still too busy to take care of themselves. Moreover, poor households will suddenly become arrogant and lewd when they become rich, forgetting their difficult times.苟安圖逸is also a weakness of our nation. It is necessary for the government to strictly implement 평克to change it.</p>

<h3>There Are Many Overseas Chinese in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— ·Zheng·Lou·Jiu·Sheng</p>
<p>The term "Overseas Chinese" is so worthy of people's faith. Indeed, these compatriots who are in remote areas and miss their homeland are incomparable to the masses in the country who are drunk and dreaming. Therefore, the people of Shanghai, out of faith, have put it into writing. Stores and schools all use the name "Overseas Chinese" to call themselves, just like the Zhongshan watch, Zhongshan pen, Zhongshan socks, Zhongshan shoes, etc. that are produced to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen. But if we interpret this |Overseas Chinese| term word for word, we feel that it is inappropriate to use it in Shanghai|domestic|. The so-called "Hua" is the Hua of Chinese, and "Qiao" is the person who lives in a foreign country. When the two words "Overseas Chinese" are put together, they mean that Chinese people living in foreign countries are called "Overseas Chinese." That is to say, people from Britain, the United States, Germany, and France who live in China are also called British Overseas, American Overseas, etc. Therefore, we believe that only Chinese people living abroad are worthy of being called "Overseas Chinese." If this Overseas Chinese has already returned to his own country, he is already Hua but not Qiao. No matter what kind of business he runs in the country, he cannot use the name Overseas Chinese, let alone those who have no relationship with Overseas Chinese at all. Suppose this business is indeed run by Overseas Chinese, and the owner is still abroad, then it can only be stated in the name that it was established with funds from Overseas Chinese. It cannot be simply and directly use the two words "Overseas Chinese" as the name, otherwise it will be a joke.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a name "Overseas Chinese School" or "Overseas Chinese Store" in Shanghai. If foreigners see it, |maybe not necessarily foreigners| would they think that this school is for Overseas Chinese children to study in? Are the main customers of this store mostly Overseas Chinese? At this time, they really seem to have arrived in Little Luzon in the South Seas!</p>
<p>Moreover, our Shanghai was not captured by the Japanese slaves during the January 28 Incident. Why do we have to call ourselves guests in our own home? Although "谦让" is the inherent virtue of our Chinese people, this kind of "turning the host into a guest" of "谦让" is really too much.</p>
<p>However, it is still acceptable for stores and schools to use Overseas Chinese as their names. Now there is even a Turkish bath |mysterious bath| in North Sichuan, which is also crowned with the two words Overseas Chinese, becoming the name "Overseas Chinese Turkish Bath." This kind of superimposed name is not only laughable, but also tarnishes the Hua</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The reputation of Overseas Chinese. No wonder the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee wants to ask the municipal government to take measures to ban it. (The facts can be found in this newspaper on the 13th of this month) Alas, "There are so many Overseas Chinese in Shanghai"!</p>

<h3>National Language Class</h3>
<p>— Hui Nong</p>
<p>This is probably a good habit unique to our esteemed school, that there is not a sound during class. But, is it really that quiet? It's just that there are so few people actually attending class, so even when they talk, their voices aren't particularly loud. But, strangely, although there are especially few people in National Language class, the talking is very loud. The class bell has already rung, but the talking continues. Anyway, if this weren't National Language class, it would probably already be silent, waiting for the teacher to arrive. At this time, they, both boys and girls, are still talking loudly, but they have shifted the topic of discussion to the National Language teacher.</p>
<p>"Is this class going to be another storytelling session?" A female student, E, sitting in the first row, said to S.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's nice to have two storytelling sessions a week," S replied.</p>
<p>"Look at his face, almost as dark as an Indian coolie, speaking with a Pootung accent, gesticulating wildly. It's really hilarious!" said the mischievous C.</p>
<p>"I think I'll just take a nap," suggested the chubby Fang.</p>
<p>At this time, the male students in the back were also discussing, no, loudly debating.</p>
<p>"L, what novel did you bring today?" asked the dark-skinned W.</p>
<p>"Me? I didn't bring anything, just a fountain pen and a notepad."</p>
<p>"Are you going to do your old homework again? But she feels about you..."</p>
<p>Just as they were talking, Mr. Gu (the National Language teacher) arrived. After taking attendance, he continued lecturing on the "Nature of Evil" section. But soon, he probably noticed that Fang in the front row was dozing off, and the others were each doing their own thing. So he said:</p>
<p>"Everyone, I have a few words to say to you. Please don't talk or doze off during class, because it is very..." He said this, and everyone burst into laughter. At the same time, S had already nudged Fang awake, but she was still rubbing her eyes, not understanding what was going on. At this time, Mr. Gu continued: "However, if you don't want to listen, feel free to read novels. Frankly speaking, National Language is not like English. Two hours of National Language a week won't do you much good... but you are only allowed to read a few kinds of translated books by Lin Shu, because his classical Chinese is very good, and reading them might be somewhat beneficial!"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Gu, these kinds of books are probably impossible to buy, right? Maybe the printing blocks have already been burned," said L.</p>
<p>"Then please just perfunctorily read the lecture notes!" Mr. Gu said with a chuckle. At the same time, a faint mutter of "old fox" was heard in the classroom, followed by another burst of laughter.</p>

<h3>Dance</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Miss Wang, who grew up in the countryside, was overjoyed to be able to attend this splendid and grand gathering today by a stroke of luck. There was endless grandeur and magnificence here: glittering and dazzling electric lights, soft and plush carpets with delicate patterns, velvet sofas, intoxicating music, gentlemen in evening dress, the fragrant bodies of the ladies, pearl necklaces, diamond rings, gentle and beautiful servants, and exquisite champagne. Everything was extravagant, everything was magnificent.</p>
<p>This was paradise, this was a palace, this was a realm she had never dreamed of. She thought, "Why am I able to come here? How unfamiliar this place is to me!" Therefore, she felt uneasy, she felt cramped, and everything felt unnatural to her. However, she was still very excited because she reflected that she was very insignificant, and being able to participate in such a grand gathering was truly a great honor. However, this was ultimately an accidental opportunity. If she hadn't been introduced here by a celebrity to raise funds for a refugee children's school, how could she have ever experienced this intoxicating pleasure on earth?</p>
<p>She sat there, bewildered by all the extravagance. All the sights that were incongruous with her stimulated her eyes without ceasing. In addition, this dashing and elegant celebrity was very attentive and kept urging her to drink, which made her even more dazed, more excited, and even more terrified.</p>
<p>After a while, the feast was cleared away, and colored lights were turned on. In the soft music and sensual light, she saw young women and ladies with open necklines, tiptoeing, each leaning in the arms of a man, dancing to the rhythm of the music. Soft waists, close affections. At this time, she met the celebrity's greedy eyes. He was completely different from his usual scholar's demeanor. "Ah, how strange this is!" She felt very scared, even trembling. Of course, this scholar would not understand her virgin's feelings. He came closer step by step, asking her to dance with him. He asked her in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Miss! Excuse me."</p>
<p>"Sir! I can't."</p>
<p>"We are all like family here, no need to be polite."</p>
<p>"No, I really can't, I have never danced before."</p>
<p>"Hahaha, then let me teach you."</p>
<p>She had no way out. His hand had already reached behind her back and was holding her in his arms. Ah! What kind of feeling was this? Her jumping heart was pressed against the celebrity's chest, jumping even more violently. However, she still struggled and said:</p>
<p>"Sir, I didn't come here to dance. I came here to plead for those many orphaned and helpless children."</p>
<p>"Yes, I always knew that, but at this time, they are all busy dancing and embracing, who can you ask for donations from?"</p>
<p>"But I have to wait, for the sake of the poor children, I can patiently wait, until they take a break."</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, then why don't we dance while waiting, and seize the moment to enjoy ourselves?"</p>
<p>"No..."</p>
<p>"Hey, now that you have come here, you might as well enjoy the extravagance here. What refugees, what orphaned and helpless children, they are irrelevant here. Just forget about them, and besides, dear Miss, you know that I love you very much!"</p>
<p>Miss Wang was silent at this time. Although she could not agree with this explanation, she was indeed completely dissolved by everything here, especially since she was still in the embrace of this gentle and considerate celebrity.</p>
<p>Then, those dirty children gradually faded from her memory.</p>
