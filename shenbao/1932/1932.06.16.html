<p>時評</p>
<h3>今日開幕之洛桑會議</h3>
<p>自一九一八年歐洲大戰休止以至目前。業巳十三年有半。此十三年有半中。歐洲形式上之戰爭。雖已休。止實則由於戰債與賠欵一問題。之播盪。歐洲政局。仍無日不處於狂風駭浪之緊張狀態中。而國際間外交上之鈎心鬥角。事實上亦無日不處於一種明爭暗門之緊張狀態中。此一問題迄於今日。以其矛盾之擴大僣加深。乃益成爲一艱難莫解之問題。自道威斯計劃揚格計劃以至目前之洛桑會議。無不爲企圖將此一問題作永久而合理的解决。換言之。即企圖使此一筆血債能獲得更鞏固之保障。然而事實上。此問題之無法解决。則亘十三年如一日。迄今更令一切之外交家。與政治家搔首焦灼。窮於應付。</p>
<p>大戰之禍首究爲德乎。抑不僅爲德乎。此一爭論。在今日顯然已爲費辭。「公理常在於强者之手。」戰敗之國。自爲罪惡所所歸。其榨取舉國人民之血肉。以平復戰勝國之忿恨。以換取奄奄一息之國脈。誰曰不宜。然而參加大戰之罪人。今巳垂垂盡矣。若子若孫固無罪也。以無罪之人。而必承負此無窮期之榨壓。使彼民族同感其前途永遠黝黑。無復有破曉之望。質之公理。揆諸人道。寗能謂得其平耶。</p>
<p>今法人力主自歐戰以還。其用於補償損失之費。共一千七百五十五萬萬佛郎。連利息併計照目前法郎價值共約二千五百萬萬佛郎但德國所繳賠欵之數。倘其計算不誤則已近五千萬萬佛郎而其中百分之五十四入於法國。姑無論其賠償數目爲何。但協約諸國由於大戰所蒙受之損失。今早已平復矣。反之德人年繳納鉅大之賠欵經濟爲人所把守。工商爲人所扼制。則早已血盡皮枯矣然而榨壓固仍茫無盡期也。此茫無盡期之榨壓又究有可以依據之理由耶</p>
<p>不僅此也。德人爲刮取其血肉。以缴納此一筆血的國債。則除出售其産品而外。蓋無他法。然而協約諸國。則又都將關稅壁壘。努力增。高。使德國之産品。無可銷納之市塲。雖欲榨取血肉而無由。則勢之所至。德人除停付賠欵而外。更無他法。「没有的東西。呌人家拿來。那是徒然的。「即世問最苛刻之債主。應亦不能不略一計及債務者之實際有無也。</p>
<p>此一問題之　結。世皆知其在於美之戰債。與法之欲以此長期　壓德國使其永永無由復興故解决此一問題之鎖鑰。一在於美。而　在於法。去年美總統胡佛提議連環緩付戰債與賠欵一年使各國都得以在此一年。之中休養生息一般人都舉爲「聰敏之債主。」然而此究非根本之解决也。戰債與賠欵已緩付矣德國之凋敝則一如往昔。即世界之凋敝。亦一如往昔是則此聰敏之債主。如果眞聰敏者。即應作進一步之根本解决。至於法國。欲以此長制德人。姑無論其終爲不可能。即其能之然而在此山窮水盡之下。德國必起蛻變。德國而一且蛻變。則全歐以至全世界。必立即捲於漩　是則法之所以困人者。同時又適所以自困耳。</p>
<p>設美而不勾銷其戰債。法而不打銷其長困德人之企圖。則賠欵問題。即經</p>
<p>過百次會議。亦爲徒然。茲法國且又有進佔魯爾區域之聲浪矣。彼洛桑會議。果能收得若何美滿之果實耶。</p>

<h3>洛桑會議今日開幕</h3>
<p>解决賠欵戰債問題</p>
<p>德代表團首先趕到</p>
<p>國民社十五日洛桑電　洛桑會雖議定於明日開幕、今夜即將開始非正式會議、九國領袖代表將在麥唐納所住旅館會商會議程序、據消息靈通者預料大約開幕演說之後、一般的辨論將限四日、至多五日、繼乃組織委員會、將辨論時所提和解决方案、就財政及政治方面分别加以研究、委員會議大約須十日、故至七月初可望有切實結果、明日會議將於上午十時在蒲利威奇旅館大會堂舉行、瑞士總統莫泰將親自歡迎諸代表、開幕禮畢即行休會、往附近杜少都旅館舉行秘密會議、德代表團已於今晨抵此間、在四大國中最先賁臨、　次爲意代表團、由外相格蘭第領袖、今午趕到、英法代表將於下午抵此　　國民社十五日巴黎電　德國與其九債權國、將於明日在洛桑會議相見、德國巳决意聲明無力再付賠欵、但自去年美總統胡佛提出停付一年計劃以來、其後世界經濟專家先後在柏林貝爾集議時、雖均證實德國巳處於山窮水盡之境、　但猶未可謂破産、因去年研究德國預算之銀行專家、皆知德人尚有鉏額資産存在國外也、惟此項國外資産之多寡、　專家報告曾承認絕對不能知其確實、約略計之、當有六十萬萬馬克、其中在國外之長期投資、約有五十萬萬、但或遠過此數、亦未可知、貝爾會議報告中、載有德人資産小組委員會之報告、謂德人國外投資所得利息、約在三萬萬與四萬萬馬克之間、雖然、德國除楊格計劃中債務外、尚有鉅額外債、據見爾會議報告中所載統計小組委員會之報告、德國長短期外債最近統之間、而每年應付利息、亦在十六萬萬至十八萬五千萬馬克之間、僅短期債欵利息已達七萬萬馬克之譜、竟比楊格計劃規定之無條件賠欵爲鉅、縱就最低數額計算、假定德國每年外債利息爲十六萬萬馬克、亦與楊格計劃所規定本年應付賠欵之十六萬七千二百十萬馬克相差無幾、因此明日在洛桑集議之專家與政治家在研究德國富力時、將發生兩大問題、即楊格計劃所定十六萬萬馬克之賠欵將自何籌措、又其每年應付之外債利息十六萬萬馬克、將自何籌措、此外德國目前預算固屬虧短甚鉅、但其預算額近年來曾有可驚之增加、其中公共建築費敎育費及守會事業費已占總歲出百分之四十三、此次驟增之開支、料在會議中亦將引起劇烈爭辯、</p>
<p>國民社十四日柏林電今日大隊民衆集合安霍德車站、歡送洛桑會議德代表團出發、在代表團抵月台及火車出發時、均高呼「勿屈服」以相勗勉、代表團由總理巴本領袖、餘爲外長紐拉思·財長克洛雪格·經濟總長汪謨博德·外交次長蒲路等、漢堡銀行家梅溪亞以財政顧問同行、此外復有關係各部部員多人、德報此時方注意於内政、對於洛桑會議絕少評論、僅一再聲稱、德國無力再付賠欵、此次不謀全部問題永久解决等語、德文世界報則警告對於會議前途、勿過於樂觀、以爲英法同意之報、末必即可視爲德國主張之前途荆棘已見减少、反之、且未嘗不可視爲法國正糾集友邦、竭其能力以謀孤獨德國云、</p>
<h3>爾虞我詐之軍縮會</h3>
<p>各代表舉行私人談話互换意見</p>
<p>無非挨延時日靜待洛桑會結果</p>
<p>國民社十四日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議主幹部採用法總理赫禮歐建議、决定不召集總委員會、赫氏提議暫由各代表重行先作私人談話、俟覓得繼續談判之適當基礎後、再開會議、今夜此間咸認主幹部此種决議、無異宣告軍縮會議休會、實乃正式贊成姑且挨延時日、靜待洛桑會議結果之苟延殘喘政策而已、蓋軍縮問題將與賠欵戰債問題同在洛桑會議獲一定議、</p>
<h3>英相將有新計劃提出</h3>
<p>據消息靈通者言、英相麥唐納將在洛桑會議提出詳細計劃、擬循非戰公約方式、締結一歐洲公約、包含停止軍縮競爭十年之規定在内、麥氏計劃此約商定後、則由軍縮會議開一會議、將其正式通過、此後軍縮會議便可無期休會、或即發一正式宣言、宣告任務巳暫告一段落、以便結朿、惟此種計劃之能否實現、將全繫於意德兩國之贊成與否、惟料德國或將不願同意、因其足以保障法國現有之軍力、與延長不平等原則者也、</p>
<h3>德代表重申軍縮態度</h3>
<p>至德國對於軍縮態度、今日德代表那度尼曾在主幹部提出一决議案、重申德國要求從性質的减縮軍備、及廢除軍用飛機·坦克車·重砲、以符凡爾賽和約内關於德國軍縮之條文、德代表提出此案時、力言技術討論旣毫無結果、爲今之計、允宜將凡爾賽和約内所定對待德國方法、施用於軍縮問題、此種方法最能獲得實在結果、於是法總理赫禮歐立起反對、堅稱法國不能同意於將凡爾賽和約軍縮規定爲出發點之任何軍縮方案、認軍縮問題祗能由直接談判解决云</p>
<h3>美主張裁減軍備一成</h3>
<p>路透社十四日日内瓦電出席軍縮會議之各國代表團、均甚活動、各方面刻正從事非公開談話、美國提議裁减海陸空軍實力至少百份之十、最近一月間、英美兩國參謀部對於此事、曾加討論、互相交換意見、軍縮會議之總務委員會、决待目前進行中之非公開談話、稍有頭緒後、始召集全體會議、非公開談話之内容、外間現尚未悉</p>
<h3>美共和黨大會</h3>
<p>主席力避提及酒禁問題</p>
<p>亞丹女士領導和平游行</p>
<p>國民十四日芝加哥電　一九三二年共和黨全國代表大會、今日在此舉行開幕禮、諸事尚稱順利、並未發生擾攘事故、開會時雖有共産黨徒數百人在會議廳左近游行示威、但經警察一度勸阻後即分散、陸續退至距會塲較遠地帶、其時並有亞丹女士者原係著名社會服務之領袖、亦率領各贊助和平自由之團體、舉行一和平游行、路經各處、時時佇立向羣衆演說并抨擊戰事或世界之戰備競爭、參加此項游行者、有不少共産黨及社會主義人物、大會開幕後、由愛荷哇州參議員狄金森宣讀主要演說詞、其中盛稱胡佛總統政策之穩健、但未提及禁酒問題并狄金森演說畢、大會即從事於各小組委員會之組織、不久即宣告延會至明日、</p>
<p>路透十四日芝加哥電　全國共和黨大會今晨在此開幕、會塲懸掛美合衆國四十八州州旗、且裝置播音全球之無綫電機、各州代表高唱歡呼、盛極一時、修正酒禁法之問題、早引起劇烈爭執、解禁派勢力或可壓倒全塲、胡佛一派由陸軍部</p>

<p>間、謀取折中辦法、抱第二種主張者居多數、至於四年前力能支配各方之主張酒禁派、則已半失敗矣、胡佛總統對於酒禁法令問題、與本黨之一部份人意見不相融合、故大會主席狄金森在開會詞中、力避酒禁問題、僅提議本黨仍舉胡佛爲候選總統、並主張美國宜保障金標準、</p>

<h3>德政府將頒布財政緊急命令三道</h3>

<p>各邦反對撤消挺進隊禁令</p>
<p>路透十四日柏林電　一九三二年德國預算案、賴近來頒佈之積極的緊要命令得以平衡、其總額爲八十二萬萬馬克、本星期中尚須頒佈緊急命令三起、裁减社會事業之經費、較白魯寗所擬者裁减尤多、今日將發表第一道命令、失業福利津貼金减落一成而二成三、失業者於享受六星期接濟後、依然全無工作、則須受一種測騐、戰役恩給金及孤兒撫育金、亦皆將裁减、凡獲工資與薪俸者、皆將按其收入繳稅百分之一、五至六、五、食鹽加稅、任何營業雖極小者亦須繳成交稅、政府稱、此後不再徵收新稅、因稅多反使收入减少也、是以補救方法在縮减國家政費、政府將以種種方法、恢復國内市塲云、</p>
<p>國民社十四日柏林電　德國維持公安之緊急命令、忽臨時决定展緩發表、其故因各邦政府反對撤消解散國家社會黨挺進隊禁令、尚待内長疏通、故須展緩數日</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>東北之謎Ｋ·</h3>
<p>（二）到理想的滿蒙新天地去</p>
<p>九一八事變發生以後、日本人對於東北、彷彿哥侖布發現了美洲、欣喜欲狂、報紙上或是講演台上、慣見慣聞的口號、是「到理想的滿蒙新天地去、」</p>
<p>日本人對於東北、本來是銳意研究的、也不斷的實地去考察的、不過從今年起、這種興味、顯得格外濃厚、在最近二三個月内、到東北去考察的、多至四十五個團體、團員合計是一千零四十三人、在上述的團體中、除了僅僅三個學生團體、帶有休假旅行的性質以外、其餘都是有特殊目的的、如東京商工會議所·大阪工業會·大阪滿蒙貿易商組合·王子·富士·　太·及其他製紙企業等、在日本工商界、都是極有勢力的、至於個人考察、如官吏議員學者軍人以及鐵道航業運輸銀行礦産森林畜牧水産大豆諸項專門家、更是絡繹於道、不計其數、其中如新任東洋拓殖會社總裁高山長幸、又是最可注意人物之一、此外新出版物之關於東北的、也充斥於書肆、如「寶庫滿蒙之招」、「滿洲小資本開業指南」「滿洲新國家事情」、「滿洲國旅行指南」、「滿蒙新國家與我生命綫」、「吾人不能於滿蒙發展乎」等等、内容均帶着誘惑的性質、足以做日本人到東北去的嚮導、如何化東北爲朝鮮第二、又是書中所反覆詳論的、</p>
<p>自日俄戰爭以後、日本以軍國主義的膨漲、藉人口過剩爲口寶、實行侵略的手段、然因美澳等洲之排斥有色人種、屢受限制、於是轉而以我國東省爲其尾閭之洩、成爲日本朝野一致的國論、最初所定計劃、是每年移民五十萬、自以爲二十年間、可以達到一千萬、但是結果事與願違、成績並不良好、蓋東北生活程度太低引不起日本農人的歆羡、而且日本並非無地可耕、遂不免安土重遷、同時我國直魯等省、災荒年年、難民竟如潮而至、視東北爲樂土、兩相比較且足證其移民理想的失敗、茲將最近十八年間、大連人口增加的數目、列表如下、以供參考、</p>
<p>日　本　人　　　中　國　人　民國元年　　三四·○四五　　七九·九七七　民國五年　　四一·六二○　　九八·七八七　民國九年　　六二·九九四　一七五·七二一　民國十二年　七四·一六九　一七五·一五六　民國十五年　八○·八五四　二○三·八五二　民國十六年　八三·一七六　二二二·四六○　民國十七年　八七·○二二　二三七·一一○　民國十八年　九○·○○三　二五○·○九一大連是日本孜孜經營的東省最大都市、也是實行移民政策的中心、而多年努力的結果、日本人只增加了五萬人、而中國人反增加至十七萬人、至大連以外、日本人口的情形、按照民國十八年的統計、是　人連　　　　　　　九○·○○三</p>
<p>關東州（大連除外）　一五·六○九</p>
<p>滿鐵附屬地　　　　　九三·九八八</p>
<p>領事館區域　　　　　　四·九九三</p>
<p>小計　　　　　一九四·九九三</p>
<p>内地散住的　　　　　　　七·九五四</p>
<p>合計　　　　　二○二·五四七</p>
<p>可見居住滿蒙一帶的日本人、仍以大連和滿鐵附近爲多、内地散住的、爲數寥寥、而且這二十萬人中、半數以上是官吏和滿鐵雇員、而非勢動者、所以日本人每謂東省爲其解决人口之生命線、可證其完全出於虚妄、而東北爲我國人的生命線、才是一個事實、</p>
<p>但是日本人决不因此而稍戢其野心、根據以上所得的敎訓、新定的移民政策、已經改變方針如下、</p>
<p>（一）以集團移民爲原則、竭力防止分散、　　　即一個村落或一大團體、全部遷移、　（二）實行屯田制、寓兵於農、使移民生命　　　財産、有極端安全的保障、</p>
<p>（三）提倡自己耕作、增加種植物種類、俾　　移民可以自給、百生活裕如、</p>
<p>（四）對於移民團、除予以種種便利外、並　　　付予補助金及設立農業銀行、使其　　　在經濟上、有充分的調劑</p>
<p>（五）謀文化設備的完全、使移民感覺生　　　活滿足、有永住的决心、無思鄉的片　　　念、</p>
<p>據關東廳長官山岡之助所宣佈、移民數目、至少爲三十萬户一百五十萬人、容納此項移民的區域、大約在延吉道方面、俾吉林和朝鮮、可以打成一片、其第一批移民的先鋒隊、已於本月從日本出發、聞日本拓務省、擬添設滿蒙局、專事調查滿蒙現狀、供給移住資料並接收其他事業的委託、一面在瀋陽設立「出張所」、以爲聯絡機關、在金州設立養成所、予移民以一種訓練、規模的偉大、可以想見、</p>
<p>現日人已集欵二千萬元、專供農村開發之用、據云、將與傀儡國訂立一種國家間之農業契約、承認土地私有、可以自由買賣、觀於各縣所出佈告、有「現在門户開於、歡迎各國投資、凡有地而無力耕種者、可隨便出租於外人」之語、是前說不爲無因、茲將佈告中所開的辦法、照錄於下、</p>
<p>（一）有田欲出租者、即可立永租合同、一　　租三十年、在此期内、不准中途撤　　租、致農業上受無形損失、</p>

<p>遼陽瀋陽鐵嶺開原本溪鳳城海城等縣、都是遼寗最肥飫的區域、物産豐饒、乃日本人垂涎已久的、日本因爲食糧不足、欲取給於東北、所以有利用朝鮮人的特長改旱田爲水田的計畫、最近已由昭和大亨等公司出面、在渾河太子河沿岸一帶、大規模的圈地、每畝給價二三十元不等、而且不是現欵、如有違抗的、就加以稻田妨害的罪名、各縣農民、以生計行將滅絕、粉粉有反對的表示、遼陽且發生聚衆持械請願的風潮、形勢非常嚴重、但是朝鮮人遷居滿鐵沿線的、最近已達十萬之衆、尚有在日本失業的朝鮮人五十萬、本來急待救濟、不久亦將應招而來、現在的預備工作、就是開渠引水、費用由政府支出、俟有了收成以後、始行按畝酌捐、一面建築汽車路、令沿路農家、各出一人、不願出人的、即須出錢、遼陽之峨嵋莊八里莊一帶的十萬畝、已定爲初步的稻田試騐塲、朝鮮人仗着日本警察的勢力、情形也與前大不相同、在鐵嶺已設立朝鮮人會、各處設立分會、海城之騰鰲堡柳西屯七嶺子三村、不得日本政府、每年要再化一千多萬、添設領事館四處、領事分館五處、領事分所十一處、且須特設「朝鮮屯、」聲勢頗爲煊赫、怪呵、爭持多年的「商租權」和「滿鮮雜居」兩個問題、到現在不已成爲費話嗎</p>
<p>我國農人之勤懇耐勞、日本人决非敵手、日本爲貫澈移民政策、必須同時阻止中國勞工入境、所以傀儡國不久要實行國籍法、規定凡非土生之人、不認其有公民權、就是請求入籍、也還要加以審查、其詳細條文、予在東北時、尚未見宣布、但是看了各縣所接到「取締外人入境」的訓令、已可明瞭日本人手腕的如何酷辣、其概略如下、</p>
<p>「查外國人進入國境、雖非盡在阻止之例、每届解决之期、民國山東以及其他各處之勞動者、移入國境　、良莠不齊、難免有便衣隊混雜其中、殊難鑑别、當茲新國家建設伊始、關於治安及公共衛生上、均有預防之必要、本部關於此類人等、取締入境辦法、正在通盤籌畫中、在辦法未經頒布以前、遇有前項勞動者入境時、務須切實取締、凡未持有護照及保證書、或無資力及保證不確實者、應即阻止入境、以維治安、而重衛生、仰即轉令所屬在國境上服務警察官、一體遵照辦理爲要、」</p>
<p>從前東北交通委員會、對於移民、訂有乘車優待章程、看所去的地方、有免費的、有減半價的、至於農具的輸運、則一律完全免費、自從日本人接收以後、即將此項章程取消、紅卍字會會因遣送九一八以後的難民、與日本人交涉了多交、但是絲毫未得通融、事後調查、朝鮮人如持有日本領事或警察官的證明書、依然可以享受此種優待、辦法兩岐、不平已極、其尤令人髮指的、如延吉一帶、早成了畸形的發展、就是朝鮮人多而中國人少、如間島一隅、中國人只有十萬、而朝鮮人反有四十萬、所以日本人在該地大有喧賓奪主之勢、近來每以搜捕會匪或義勇軍爲名故造恫嚇空氣、所以膽小的中國人、都棄其家産而去、又因爲邊界檢查很嚴、不准携帶多物、只得將細軟打成包裹、託郵局代爲寄遞、日本在該處、本已違約設立警察局十三處、現又添設五處、凡彼認爲行迹可疑的我國人、常在馬路上被綁、從此宣告失踪、建築堅固的中國房屋、每指爲可以藏匿歹人、竟無端的轟毁、如四五百家的二道溝、現已成爲瓦礫、和上海的閘北一樣、這樣的慘無人道、我國人除了遷避以外、國有其他方法麽、</p>
<p>由此看來、我國人以後不但無移殖東北的希望、而且已經移殖東北的勞動者、也非爲日本人盡數驅逐不可、觀於本年春季由大連一埠來往人數的統計、很容易的可以證實我言之决非危詞聳聽、</p>
<p>（甲）經大連來東北的、計减少六千六百四十五人</p>
<p>一月份　男一二·三○三人、女一　·五七五人、共一三·八七八人、較去年　同月增加三四七人、</p>
<p>二月份　男一六·六三七人、女一　·六五四人、共一八·二九一人、較去年　同月增加八七九一人、</p>
<p>三月份　男三五·○四七人、女三　·五○二人、共三八·五四九人、較去年同月减少一五七○三人、</p>
<p>（乙）經大連去東北的、計增加四萬三千五百十五人、</p>

<p>三月份　田二四·八七五人、女二　·五○八人、共三七·三八三人、較去年同月增加一三六六六人、</p>
<p>爲期不過三個月、營口安東許多口岸還不在内、我國人來减去增的數目、合計已達五萬之多、就此一端而言、日本人爲欺騙我國人所高唱「共存共榮」假面具、至此已完全揭穿、却成了「有我無你」和「你死我活的代名詞、</p>
<p>自從上海事件解决以後日本軍隊、幾乎全部開往東北、一方面壓迫我國人的能力、突然增加、一方面日本商人和浪人、也就跟踪而至、商地除添了許多日本商店以外、料理店（即妓館）理髮館鴉芹烟館賭場等等、亦復到處皆是、同時軍用郵便局也成立、日本警察也出現於市上、儼然成了日本化了、哦呀、我不知道這是什麽境界、哈爾濱的市上、已有了土肥原街和多門街、瀋陽東陵的附近、就要建設乃木村、錦州東門外新築的馬路、竟稱某某通某某町、日本的野心、這足證極端的表現了、（六月十日於北平）</p>

<p>一二八事變　當一二八戰事發生後、海軍之應付、極爲困難、因有關於國家榮辱、軍事秘密、及其他種種、固不能將經過情形、明白宣布、致與論譁然、對於本軍、發生誤會、本人於此、固無膚嘵嘵置辯、此外向有一二不良份子、乘機厚誣本軍、實則彼等具有政治背景、意圖消滅本軍、無知民衆、一時爲其所惑、隨聲附和、妄加指摘、須知在法治精神之國家、吾輩軍人、應絕對服從政府命令、以符法令、本軍之行動、一唯中央命令是從、雖本軍之物質方面、經濟方面、均不如人、然對於政府命令、雖赴湯蹈火、亦不敢辭、當十九路軍向本軍假用高射砲及鋼板時、因各艦中裝高射砲者極少、而有多數艦艇、並無高射砲之裝置、所有新購之鋼板、至今日仍存留海關棧房、因無欵可提出、致每月尚須出數千兩之棧租、而外間對此兩事、攻擊紛來、惟事實俱在、固難抹煞也、</p>
<p>本年度建設　氏又謂中央對於本年度海軍之擴充費用、現已議决將三分之二、改爲擴充空軍之用、立法院亦已通過、查美英諸國、環視世界大勢、各國參衆兩院之議員、莫不敦請政府擴充海軍爲當務之急、而吾國適得其反、故本年度海軍當難再有任何之建設矣、</p>

<p>二一技譚</p>
<h3>從法西斯蒂說到鍾馗</h3>
<p>— 瞻</p>
<p>法西斯蒂是外國政黨，鍾馗是唐朝進士，這是不會發生聯帶關係的；我偏來聯帶一下子。</p>
<p>法西斯蒂，是Fascisti的譯音；要是譯意，或譯棒喝黨，或譯黑衣黨；東洋人又譯作汎繫黨，這也是譯音，而無字義可講。</p>
<p>這個政黨，是歐戰以後發生的；是極端的國家主義，豪俠主義；自從墨索里尼——意大利首相提倡以後，現在又在東洋抬頭了，以致犬養毅死於非命!法西斯蒂的威，足使一般要人，望而生畏。</p>
<p>我想，與其譯作毫無意義的法西斯蒂；不如譯作望文生訓的髮鬚豎的·好在髮鬚豎的，和法西斯蒂諧音；人家見了這四個字，便已描出一副極端帝國主義豪俠主義的狰獰面目。</p>
<p>要是去了語尾，簡單稱之；便可喚做髮鬚豎黨，或髮鬚豎主義；這般鬚髮怒張的政黨，那得不令人生畏!</p>
<p>有人聽我這般說，指着廳堂上所掛一幅髮鬚倒豎的鍾馗圖像，笑向我說道：</p>
<p>他也是法西斯蒂，他也是髮鬚豎的。</p>
<h3>可憐山陰諸大空</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>右之標題。爲昔年黄晦聞寄懷諸貞壯之詩句也。諸爲紹興人。名宗元。號眞長。别署大至居士·博通羣籍。精經世之學。前清光宣之交。佐蘇撫及兩湖總督瑞莘儒幕。與李拔可夏劍丞朱　文王饒生同事。投分最深。光復後。歷任浙江電政監督。北京國務院秘書。南京敎育部秘書。商務印書館編輯等職。勤愼精幹。儕輩重之。去冬。臥病滬寓。旋愈旋發。延至四月二十六日逝世。享壽五十有八。大業未成。憔悴以終。海内同文。良深哀悼。散原老人爲書墓石。題曰詩人諸貞壯先生之墓。復丹林書。有「貞壯遽逝。此才可惜」之暵。</p>
<p>居士工詩能文。尤善書法。汪辟疆光宣詩壇點將錄。以地英星天目將彭圯擬之。謂居士詩味雋而永。與　庵有二妙之目。信然。遺詩存稿。都兩千餘首。同人刻謀彙刋。闡幽之誼。後死之責也。　居士嗜藏古籍。蒐集甚富。精本尤多。十八年夏杭寓遭火。所藏一炬俱燼。家人僅以身免。心甚痛惜。白髮鬖鬖。儼然古稀老人。居恒健譚。偶逢知己。滔滔不絕。一日以照片示其友陸丹林曰像我否。陸戲答曰。此石膏像影片耳。居士笑而口占一絕云。「故人戲喚石膏像。狂客自疑木乃伊。骸骨未衰心力在。歌呼仍是少年時。」其風趣詼諧類如此。</p>
<p>居士病中。神忐清明。雖臥病榻。不廢吟詠。易簧之前數日。猶自擬挽語三聯。其一云。「死亦大難。三個月從容過去。生猶何戀。一顆心始終護持。」其二云。「揮手作絕命詞。事猶太早。潔身於據亂世。曾爲其難。」其三云。「於戲諸貞壯。不願死婦人女子之手。莊嚴極樂國。皈仍在阿彌陀佛之前。」悽凉中有崛强氣。讀之惘然。</p>
<p>殯葬雖了。而遺孤待養。遺集待刋。茲由知以右任亞子季平譽虎行嚴夷初等發起勸募。通啓情文并至。聞出於衆異手筆。文云。亡友諸君貞壯。早躭樸學。晚困微官。室無宿糧。家徒立壁。曩在浙省。管理電政。處脂不潤。同輩交稱。惟富藏書。復又悉燬於火。比年浮沉滬瀆。生事益艱。遽遘沉疴遂捐館舍。寡妻遺妾。無以資生。子女未婚嫁者七人。尚待敎養。生前遺著。扃置篋中。亦宜急付　人。廣爲流布。伏念道交義合。固平生之歡。而扶弱表微。亦後死之責。執事不忘死友。高義薄雲。脫參指囷。誼無多讓。庶幾衆擎易舉。集腋成裘。俾孀孤藉以苟全。纂述免於散佚。殁存感刻。寗有津涯云云。</p>
<h3>名流識小錄</h3>
<p>— 費文寶</p>
<p>商界元老虞洽卿先生。與市商會主席王曉籟先生。演說時度姿勢。並臻上乘。惜略帶沙音。未免美中不足。家庭工業社有唱片發音膠出售。能使老片不沙沙作響。若更能發明良藥。滋潤喉音。則兩公之演說。允推獨步申江。曉翁於演唱黑頭時。黄鐘大呂。音大聲宏。反别饒韻味。此其得天獨厚處。　徐新六先生。陳霆銳律師。皆翩翩張緒。而又面團團如富家翁。近視眼時常誤認。惟陳律師忽於今夏。殤其次子。痛抱西河。悵觸綦切。以致面色略帶淡黄。一時有徐白陳黄之說。</p>
<p>味精廠老板吳藴初博士。精太極拳。嘗在二家兄咸一處。觀其表演。迴翔中節。遲速合法。頗具化學家數。演推手時。雙手偶並。十指尖尖。與其出品佛手商標。極度相似。</p>
<h3>無臂婦</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>西班牙伐倫西亞有婦。名瑪迦里在。生而無臂。乃以足代手服勞。久之。常人以手指所爲者。婦咸能以足趾優爲之。如書習字帖針織。刺繡。靡不精工。用能持梳理髮。粘紙成玩具。有時伉儷間。情趣勃發。則以足趾輕捻良人之頰資以笑樂。故無臂婦之名。廣播全國。雖大總統柴摩拉亦知之。今已特許以婦之工作品陳列於西班牙各省會矣。</p>
<p>瑪迦里太七齡時。能以足進食。而性喜美術。嗣以求學意請於父母。父母以女已殘廢。良不便。婉拒之。而女向學心殷。黽勉自修。寖假能以足趾握管矣。又寖假足之工作能如常人之出諸手者矣。婦言。初習時。至覺艱困。見者輒笑其愚。然渠不爲心灰。閉户强習。久乃純熟。至於今日。竟能得心應足矣。婦卒以多能而獲愛人。嫁後。伉儷綦篤。已有子。年十齡。四肢俱全。且健而聰慧。今一家數口之衣着。咸出婦之十趾。有閒。兼及刺繡細工。此婦所持以自豪者也。</p>
<p>西班牙人某。嘗揄揚婦之技能於法友。友斥爲誑。爭執良久。友曰。願以千佛郎爲賭。苟婦能工作吾前。如君所述者。吾輸千幣。否則須破君囊矣。議旣定。遂遣人持旅費往迎婦。婦慨然就道。及至。於法人前竭其技能。其敏巧不啻若自手出也。於是法人乃爲驚服。出金擲諸案曰。天地間果有奇人。脫非目覩。吾終不之信也。某乃以所勝金贈婦。且復供歸途旅費焉。噫。如婦者。誠足愧夫一般肢全而廢學者流。宜乎其受總統之敬重也。</p>
<h3>槍桿與筆桿</h3>
<p>— 烟</p>
<p>余輯珊瑚半月刋。徵稿於程君小靑。程君慨然願爲之助。撰一霍桑探案。名八十四。曲折周密。固無待贅言。而爲余介一鄧營長之抵抗日記。尤所心感。鄧營長守吳淞四星期。於最激烈之奮鬥中受創。就治於蘇州之博导習醫院。程君往慰問。遂訂交焉。其後往返甚密。日記自一二八起至受創而止。其間寫吳淞防禦之工作。與二十餘日苦守之情况。至爲詳盡。以視向壁虚造與捕風捉影之記載。自異其價值。近鄧營長已入閩矣。臨行致程君書。謂「將來如有特别所得。仍當寫奉也」。程君曾勉以「再努力兩年」。故渠答言。「不知兩年後。國事之環境又何如耳」。末更有熱烈忠勇之精神。流露於字裏行間。謂「昔人云。太夫誓許國。死生奚足論。我决心趁此精强力富的年華。努力幹一番福國利民的事業。做一個中流砥柱的救國軍人。成敗利鈍。非所計也」。讀之氣壯。掮槍桿者復能掮筆桿。一難。掮筆桿者與掮槍桿者引爲知已。二難。掮槍桿者肯熱忱以助掮筆桿者。三難也。</p>
<h3>廉儉救國說（十三）</h3>
<p>— 聶會紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>附識二昆山敎育局長潘吟閣君。兩年前赴日考察敎育。歸撰一文。言日本勤勞儉苦之美風。與宗敎大有關係。蓋國人皆受佛敎之陶鑄。共敎義安於儉約故也。潘君可謂善覘國情者矣。查前歲日本文部省登記。全國佛敎徒凡四千一百餘萬人。約十人中而七八矣。其維新諸傑。多爲陽明學者。亦爲禪學家也。日本忽滑谷快君。撰陽明與禪一書。言陽明即禪。禪即陽明。引證甚詳。其書經劉君仁航譯印。今已缺板。夫安於儉約之敎義。乃能使國富强。精神與物質。皆有關擊。本文略已具述。尚有一重要意義。有待於說明者。蓋安於儉約。則不勞其神於種種事物欲念。而能專心於學問職務也。曾文正公曰。精神要令有餘於事。此語深堪玩味。今日時局艱危。内政·外交·敎育·軍事·皆百廢待舉。當事者雖竭全力以赴之。猶虞不足。若更重以私産之營辦。嗜好之紛紜。姑無論其貪蹟。而公事之敷衍廢弛。不待言矣。孔子曰。以約失之者鮮矣。約必寡欲。故心力常有餘。應事不虞竭厥。所謂用志不紛。乃凝於神。此儒家崇儉尚約之深意也。至佛制更不許蓄私財。糞掃三衣外。别無長物。要使簡約至極不雜用心耳。日人善守此意。宜其精神有餘而發揚蹈厲也。此非我國人之所當愧奮勉力者乎。（完）</p>
<h3>感時零話</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>侵略我們的是我們的仇敵。但是我們如果因侵略而振作强盛起來。那麽侵略我們的倒反而成爲我們的畏友了。常常看見戀愛塲中的人爲失戀而自殺。從來汉有看見政治塲中的人爲失地而自殺。</p>
<p>中國的政治同中國的戲劇一樣。只注重一個主解。所以永遠演不出一齣全體拿手的好戲。</p>
<p>要人辭職。工人罷工。階級雖然不同。但不滿於現時的生活。則是一樣。　　實行「解甲歸田」。那就是徹底覺悟。因爲只有農人纔是祖國忠實的兒子。只有農人纔是致力於祖國的立國之本。</p>
<p>我說。工俄國的民性是偉大的。德國的民性是深刻的。美國的民性是聰明的。日本的民性是險毒的。中國的民性是衰頽的一。</p>
<p>在野的軍人戒着「武力抵抗」。但是他們却「無力抵抗」。在職的軍人「有力抵抗」。但是他們却「不肯抵抗」所以閙到現在失地喪權·</p>
<p>我們全國的官民一致喊着「没辦法」。所以我們的國家永遠陷在没辦法的狀態當中。</p>
<p>短訉　名書畫家俞劍華氏。工書善畫。今更匠心别運。製成精美小品數十件。大不盈尺。小不及寸。手卷横披。屏聨立軸。各式俱備。並其平日作品百二十件。於十一日起假五馬路棋盤街轉角新洋房内開第五次書畫個展。歡迎參觀。不用門券云。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（八○）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十回　權門網紀欺凌賴有閨人慰藉捷徑苞苴利達命將命盜招安　安玉田吐了吐舌尖。總算今天又長了一番見識。知道軍閥們是這般難見。手下的承啓官又這般厲害。逃回到旅館。一開發車錢。因爲汽車多等了六個小時竟還白損失了大洋一十八元。不外夫花錢買罪受。及到半夜裏梁笑雲也回來了。安玉田早飽吃過了一頓。又悶睡了一會。體力已經復原。才吞吞吐吐的把這事約略報告。梁笑雲駭然道。你怎麽又不聽我的話。仍替我添岔子呢。安玉田忙辯道。這件事你却要原諒我的。你想呀。我要在此地做官。以後出進衙門。總不能每次都須仗著太太梢帶。招旁人看不起。所以我才一個人去試一試。但不想又試糟了。這只怪我福命太薄。本事又小。不配做這個官。辜負你一番期望。我看。你也不必埋怨我了。算你認錯了人。拉拔了個扶不起的劉阿斗。趁早還是取消這個奢望。一同回北京去。找我所容易幹的事去幹。那怕是替你看門當差。我都願意。言下百感交集。將近日前後所受過的委屈一齊勾上心頭。忍不住還滴下幾點英雄之涙。梁笑雲初聽他發牢騷。本有些不快。及見他傷心落涙。像個小可憐蟲。想著男子們的眼涙例不輕彈。與女性們器是家常便飯的性質不同。不是眞受了大委屈。絕不能逼得他到這種樣兒。彼此情感正熱。痛癢相關。一顆心就不覺立時軟了下來。反對他要特加憐惜。便一把將他拖到一張大靠椅上躺下。自己特陪他也斜坐在那椅圈邊。親手搖出一方小絲巾。替他輕輕的擦去了眼角的涙痕。并堆下花一般的笑容。將半邊粉頰偎貼著他那绷緊了的腮帮。極其悱惻纒綿的柔聲說道。玉田。你怎麽啦。我不過說這件事出了點小小的岔子。要想法補救。你就誤會我是在埋怨你嗎。我不是不明白的人。很知道世上種種的難處。像你這樣純潔高傲的靑年。初跑到這一個奇怪的環境中來。當然有許多生疏。許多不慣。使你會感覺異常的煩悶和無窮的痛苦·</p>

<h3>銀洋市頓轉好象</h3>
<p>徐徐增進二釐半　　市場概况　連日銀洋市氣、頓轉好象、雖無特殊狂變、而其徐徐增進、亦足可觀、據個中情形、緣近來以　價日低、銀爐方面、設法拾價收吸英洋及龍洋等老幣、以備鎔烊、故市上現底方面、略有銷耗、厥後可無虞再有充裕之現狀、銀根因結束期已過、金融界正從事擴充、故形勢轉佳耳</p>

<h3>紗花紗市跌風稍定</h3>
<p>棉紗市情略堅、因連跌九日、市氣轉佳、引起一部份獲利者扒空、故形勢較定且有業外者傾向做多、因其底盤巳小之故也、比高價已跌去十二兩之譜、因此市盤平靜、但現紗需要仍滯、四方匪患太熾、而内地經濟枯竭、兼之日商在四處浸占甚力、本紗銷路大受打擊也、</p>
<p>人標扒空略殷　人標前市開盤、以美棉平定然塲内人氣仍弱各月跌三四錢、二三盤有大户購進回漲、結果各月漲二·五·七錢、午後開盤風勢劇烈、漲四·五錢二三盤又跌、各月跌二·三·四錢、全日成交統計二萬九千五百包、查賣出賡豐一千二百五十包、長豐七百五十包、天隆六百包大昶八百五十包、信誠五百包、買進恒昌一千二百包、吉豐九百包、德記六百包、同和六百五十包茲將人標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>棉市大跌小回</h3>
<p>棉市轉堅　實以連跌九日、應有此反動現象、且引起一殷獲利者了結、故市盤遂見緊張然大勢狀况、仍在悲境中、寗波交易所因近日市價暴落、已有停拍之說查去年全年外棉、上海進口三百八十餘萬担本棉祗一百餘萬担、今年一·二·三·四·四個月外棉進一百五十餘萬担、照以上情形觀察、外棉進口之巨爲歷來所罕見本棉消費、大部份被外棉搶去、故在此種情形之下、棉市前途、殊難樂觀也、</p>

<p>滬南　昨日米市、西路來滙三十餘艘、浦存漸厚、城鄉店　、乃觀到積日夥、兼之洋米艘削、且閱報載皖省開境、人心更覺軟弱、中關厚粳猛瀉四角、頂宿者賤而不化、薄稻到頭雖有、然道户揀取鮮暴而已、中宿竟告寂寞、市價高削三角、洋蘆尖到銷均懈、市　疲逾、</p>
<p>滬北　昨日新閘米市、内地來源四十號左右、早晨臨市者、作客極缺、常錫北粳早稻飛來紅薄稻等各低二三角、蘆洋尖到銷均懈、市歸疲遂、變陰元貨雖不多、但銷路滯細、洋米客銷不動、本街淡薄致價又疲、</p>
<h3>洋米跌後銷動</h3>
<p>價小五六分　　　鎭江江北續有辦裝　昨日洋米以市上存到兩足、客化呆木、兼以杜米湧到價落市面頗見不佳上午開市後各客概不問津、内地本街亦不過問、祗有少數本街應酬小絞等米三四百包、價乃跌落四分至五六分、下午江北·崇明·鎭江各客帮以價落合劃、隨即在市辦去小絞二千多包、行情略形回定、統市售開一號西貢一百五十包、價十一元六角半、小絞白勝米三百包、價十元零四角半、普通大市小絞三千包、價十元零三角至一角半、敏黨米百餘包、價十元零七角半云、</p>
<h3>粉市晨疲午回</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份又趨疲落之象、以洋麥報價、依然低落、芝坎兩處續小三五角左右、而各處實銷、均因金融關係、迄難發展、所以人心平軟、開價步鬆、七八月份收盤八錢六分二釐半、較小一分外、餘亦小去七釐半至五釐、迨至下午開盤交易仍寂、惟因期麥報漲、人心轉定、開價較上午略覺回高、觀察前途、必須實銷良奸、方有起色、否則擯住仍屬無益、兵船現貨仍喊一兩九錢半扣、紅藍車一兩九錢一分半、砲臺一兩八錢八分、餘照標準、結果七月份較前日小七釐半、八月份小二釐半、餘無上落云、</p>
<h3>標麥午後暴漲</h3>
<p>現麥到旺價疲　昨日期麥上午開盤、因洋麥報小三五角、交易旣稀、市鮮出入、祗七月份微帶穩定、迨至下午開盤、忽呈漲勢甚健、交易亦見暢盛、聞鼎泰某客户對七八九月份、均步步爭進、致市面遂爲激動、頗具生氣、惟無錫帮則因現麥低廉、故亦隨勢抛出、數亦甚鉅、查目下現麥、可以交入標準者、祗三兩左右、而某客户有此興胃、恐另有作用耳結果七月份較前日景暴漲八分、八月份漲六分、九月份漲五分、十月份漲七分、十一月份漲四分、現麥到源逐見旺盛、惟開價低疲、九折身分之雙鳳麥祗開二兩八錢、蓬萊安亭麥開二兩七錢、吳淞麥開二兩六錢、計一千包云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白趨勢轉定</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤交易仍寥、但市氣均見轉穩、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價爲十三兩九錢、進出兩懈、香港貨十三兩七錢、交易頗盛、趨勢似已由疲轉定、九號荷赤九兩九錢、市形尚俏、太古糖交易依然凋零、CW嘜十五兩九錢至八錢半、Ｈ嘜十二兩四錢、市象尚覺穩秀云、</p>
<h3>絲茶茶市形勢不利</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、日來形勢、愈趨不利、各路珍眉綠茶、市盤已跌五十兩、在華商已是忍痛求售各莊行家亦因茶價相宜、日前已發出大批電報兜銷、無如國外茶商、鑒於滬市開盤跌價太速、深悉華茶商堅持力薄弱依然抱定抑價宗旨、以待時機、時以邇來綠茶市面、僅針眉秀眉等副貨、略有交易、百兩關外之珍眉、幾於完全不動、惟昨市祁門紅茶、因英莊補充缺額、去路略見活潑、但售價亦視前見跌二三十兩、市勢仍難認爲樂觀云、</p>
<h3>五金黑鐵釘跌價一兩餘</h3>
<p>黑鐵釘銷路、向以東三省烟臺天津以及長江路爲最暢達、近則東三省受兵事影響、交易毫無、天津·長江諸帮、均因銀根緊急關係、亦無大宗需辦、故市上之點綴者、不過烟臺一隅而已、况最近緣霉訉關係、去路大遜、而本埠來貨則疊疊而到、因此供廣於求、人心大恐、標準開價勢不得不見下跌也、如三分每箱估四十三兩、四分</p>
<p>四十二兩、五分四十一兩七錢半、六分四十二兩、比之前市均各回落一兩至一兩五錢不等、聞交易依然清淡云、</p>
<h3>新鐵絲跌二錢半</h3>
<p>新鐵絲新近交易雖較前爲活動、惟市貨極多、而到源又衆、因此人心不佳、標凖回跌二錢半、計每担祗售十三兩、（係十六號至二十號）至於二十一號至二十五號則每担要開十三兩七錢半、查進口漢口·温州·杭州·諸帮、均有走動、别帮買賣、似覺冷落云、</p>
<h3>靑鉛昨交八十餘噸</h3>
<p>靑鉛因實用方面無大點綴、市象十分冷落、故標凖頗爲散淡、昨日福建帮突來購去八十餘噸、（約一千四百餘担）市情因之一振、開價每担爲十三兩二錢、</p>
<h3>煤炭　柳江煤售價暗疲</h3>
<p>柳江白煤塊、近日來走銷不動、市價暗疲、現售頭號貨每噸十五兩二錢半、二號貨（即臭煤）每噸十一兩七錢半、又紅崎塊煤市價亦跌、每噸現售十九兩七錢半、較前約跌一兩云、</p>

<h3>官話</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>羅文幹談中日糾紛　　他說，上海問題，猶如割破手指，尚不關輕重，東省問題，如肺病，足以制人死命，</p>
<p>原來上海問題，只如割破手指，無關輕重的，我輩方才明白，惟現在還有幾個不識時務的國人，還閙着上海問題呢，本來江蘇人的心理，或者廣大一點說是南方人的心理，東北原來是張家的天下，中央本來無法統屬，只有覊縻，並且日本人說，東省本來隨時可以放入袋内，現有了蘇俄的關係，有不得不急轉直下之勢，上海爲中外通商鉅埠，關係我國，非常密切，我今天來敬告國人，不要着急，不要胡閙，羅外長說，上海問題，如割破手指無關輕重的，</p>
<p>又說，余前日赴滬視察，一二八之創㾗猶在，但人民的情緒，與未經事變，前相差無幾，健忘如此，令人不寒而慄，（這話的確不差）我人辦理外交，惟以國家人民利益爲前提，但外交政策尚未成熟之前，往往有不得不保守秘密者，如一經洩露，致功虧一簣，</p>
<p>外交問題，確有保守秘密的必要，但這種應嚴守秘密的部分，大抵屬於我國有利方面的，若屈辱的外交，與喪權辱國的外交，亦照樣嚴守秘密，一俟大錯鑄成，人民雖力竭聲嘶，亦無法挽救，我現在再來敬告國人，聽羅外長的話，且靜默着，且觀望着，不要去破壞他功虧一簣的成績，</p>
<p>他又說，國人應時時以東北爲念，其意若曰，你們不必去念上海，去念東北罷，啊，我輩可憐的人民，念也如此，不念也如此，况且要念東北，先要政府去念，一般手無寸鐵的小百姓，呌他如何念法呢，現在旣有以國民利益爲前提的政府，一般小百姓自可以不必去念，倘然念了，恐怕又要破壞他的功虧一簣，並且政府的念，我也耳孰能詳，一二八事變，大念其長期抵抗，九一八事變，大念其討罰僞國，收復失地，政府眞無時不在念也，小百姓尚何念之有，</p>

<h3>東北四哀詩（續）</h3>
<p>— 苕主</p>
<p>哀龍江　蝦夷已破昻昻溪，鐃歌一路行如飛，黑雲過江大於馬，半日已薄龍江下，龍江將軍勇絕倫，賊軍畏之若天神，連日鏖戰幾大捷，力盡援絕於潰奔，孤城無險不可據，吏民盡勸將軍去，民愛將軍如父兄，忍擲全城作孤注，將軍去矣賊入賊，馬上但聞呼號聲，嗚呼將軍此退非得己，來春及早收賊壘。</p>
<h3>哀錦州</h3>
<p>奔車一夜轔轔聲，我軍盡向關内行，錦城高高天尺五，有城不守奈何許，黄昏胡笳城上吹，賊不血刃皆登陴，截城闌殺者爲誰，遼西義民邊城兒，奮臂直入不畏死，矢與名城共終始，創㾗入骨蹶復起，畢命猶然切其齒，明日蝦夷屠四門，傳聞　及雞與豚，吁嗟乎，我民殺賊非不力，爭奈三軍先避賊，北門鎖鑰今大開，賊軍飲馬長城來。</p>

<p>「兩地之間旣没有電線連接着，聲音怎樣能夠傳達？」這是我常常聽到的問題。我們要了解這個問題，就得先明瞭：「有線電話一之所以能夠傳聲，並不是我們的語言能夠在電線上流通；電線上所能夠通行的只有電流、所以電話機有兩種作用：</p>
<p>（一）使聲音變成電流；</p>

<p>我們的語言由甲電詁機變成電流，藉電線傳到乙電話機：乙電話機將這個電流變成聲音，使我們的語言還原而達於聽者之耳。這樣往復起來，甲乙兩人便能夠對談。</p>
<p>有線電話機甚爲簡單，能夠兼任收發兩職；無線電話機較爲複雜，發音和收音的機器就得分别設立。發音的機器呌「播音機」，收音的機器呌「收音機」。播音機和收音機上都裝有「天線」。天線是用漆包的或錫包的紅銅線紐成細繩狀，用高柱子架在户外的空中。</p>
<p>電話機上的耳機有兩端；一端是爲傳話用的；一端是爲聽話用的。所以播音機上必須有特製的「傳聲器」：收音機上也必須有持製的聽聲器。聽聲器有兩種：一是「聽筒」，是個人套在兩耳上聽的；一是「喇叭」，是使衆人共聽的。</p>
<p>我們對着播音機的傳聲器演講或奏樂，那播音機便將聲浪變成電磁浪；這電磁浪由天線播送到空中，由空中的以太（註）傳達於四方：播音機的電力越大，播送的路程就越遠。在這電磁浪所能達到的區域之内，若安有收音機，那收音機的天線就可以將這電磁浪接收下來，由收音機將電磁浪變成聲浪，由喇叭或聽筒放出來，我們就可以聽到播音台所播的音樂或名人的演講了。</p>
<p>（註）|科學家認爲「熱」「光」「電」之所以能夠傳達，一定有一種媒介物，而且這種媒介物一定是很稀薄很堅韌的，是瀰漫於宇宙之間，充塞於萬物之内的。科學家爲便於說理起見，便名之曰「以太」。其實這種東西至今還是理想的，還没有科學家親眼見過。科學家雖然費了不少的光陰和腦汁，到底没有掃去科學上這朶暗雲。</p>

<h3>瓶宫秘史</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>前天我在馬路上閒逛，看見一個衣衫襤褸的人，站在水門汀堦沿上，手裏提着幾條絲圓繩，每條繩的下端，都繫着一個没底的破藥水瓶，站在那裏，一頭玩弄，一頭喊着「兩個銅板看一看」，我見了心中奇怪，想一個破碎的藥水瓶，有怎麽好看呢，心裏這樣想着，兩只脚不由自主地立定了，不多片刻，看見來了幾位小弟弟，爭先恐後的跑過來，將那人手裏的破瓶，接到手中，架在眼睛上，像煞打望遠鏡一般地觀看，四五個破瓶，八九個觀衆，弄得供不應求，不到一點鐘，小弟弟的錢，給那人賺去了不少，這般小看客，賞鑒好了破瓶以後，一張小臉上，都現着萬分快愉的彩色，并且嘴裏不住地喊着「啊唷眞好看，有趣，一個男人搭一個女人……」我見了這種形狀，聽了這樣言語，眞弄得丈二長的和尚，摸不着頭腦，心想一個破碎的小瓶，望上去空空如也，有怎麽好看呢，究竟他們在那兒看什麽呢，假使没有花　在裏面，那能會吸引得這般小同胞這樣地歡天喜地啊，唷！不是聽見他們在那裏說一個男人一個女人嗎·不要裏面有什麽秘密啊·一時眞招不着一個答案來，</p>
<p>後來碰着隔壁的×××，他是上海一個白相人，無奇不懂，無事不精，告訴了他上面的把戲，他說，現在有一般人，挖空心思，想出這個瓶底西洋鏡來，它的組織，是拿拍就的春宫，罩上一塊小小的大光玻璃，塞在瓶口上，把瓶底敲去，繫了繩子，在馬路上騙一般小孩子的銅鈿，唉！我聽了他的話，恍然大悟，怪不得吸引力有這樣厲害，原來是看的秘戲圖，唉！這種把戲，傷風敗俗·小孩們智識未開，被牠這樣引誘，小小的心靈中，無形受着一種絕大的惡敎訓，爲害眞不淺啦，</p>

<h3>走方郎中</h3>
<p>— 你</p>
<p>某日，一個暑熱的中午，門外走進</p>
<p>兩個不速之客。</p>
<p>頭一個走進來的，穿着一件香雲紗長衫，接着後面又踱進一個身穿「起碼西裝」頭戴「拿破崙帽」的形似「包打聽」的人。</p>
<p>「你們此地有人不大舒齊嗎？」那個穿香雲紗長衫的唐突地問。</p>
<p>「什麽不大舒齊？」我不懂。</p>
<p>「阿有人勿受用？」</p>
<p>「……什麽？……」</p>
<p>「勿好過？」</p>
<p>「…………？」</p>
<p>終於，那個穿香雲紗長衫的閉了口，讓穿「起碼西裝」的講話。</p>
<p>「你們這裏有生病的人嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有。」</p>
<p>「哦！但是上海經過了這次閘北的戰事，將來傳染病必定很盛行，難保貴府上没人傳着；所以你們最好現在打兩針防染針！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你。我們過幾天便想去打！」我以爲他們兩人一定是工部局衛生處的調查員。</p>
<p>「啊！不能夠，你們不看見報上說患處列拉的很多嗎？……我看還是早打幾天的好！我現在已經把針帶來了，你立刻就打好嗎？「</p>
<p>「要錢嗎？」</p>
<p>「打仔再講，有現（限）個！」我終於明白他們的來意，他們便是一般人所謂「走方郎中」。</p>
<p>「阿拉醫生是花旗留學的呢！」那個穿香雲紗長衫的揷嘴說：「回來時還路過羅宋度印（大英）法蘭西·喝·外國人都看好了成千成萬呢！隨便什麽人只看一次，從來没有看兩次的，哈哈，都是「一劑而平安」。「</p>
<p>我暗暗好笑，美國回來如何經過俄英法三國的呢？吃他藥的人大概都被他「包送終」了，連第二次都來不及……」。</p>
<p>許多的話換了幾聲「哦，哦……忽要，忽要！」</p>
<p>計無所施，他們只好出門。</p>
<p>過了一會見，我偶然探頭出門，忽然又看見他們兩個人從阿祥嫂家的後面走出來，接着，阿祥嫂家的後門發出了一個刺耳的聲音「碰！」</p>

<h3>蚊擾的夜裏</h3>
<p>— 森森</p>
<p>在前幾夜，春末夏初相交時候，氣候熱度突然增高，B和S合住的斗大寄舍裏，隔年蚊虫，等時活動，乘B入睡，就進行侵略手段，「痛呀|痛呀|蚊虫有了「B被刺後驚覺呼救聲，「嗄|」S不關痛養底淡然回答，蚊虫向你吮血，與我無涉，何必大驚小怪，破人好夢，他在心裏咕嚕着，同時反身過來，向B處看去，可憐的B已被蚊虫征服了，昏昏底睡着，面臂股諸部，多滿駐了蚊虫，任意吮血，還有幾處小部份的足趾，却在跳動，表示反抗，然已不能挽回大局了，S耳聞目擊同伴被人侵害，却豪不介意去救，却忍心合眼仍去續他的蜜夢，</p>
<p>嗡嗡蚊虫分了隊，出其不意，在S面部刦掠，聰敏的他，驚醒坐起，忙用枕邊放着的書本，奮向蚊虫抵抗，奸滑的小虫，他本用聲東擊西法，分離他倆的抵抗力，擾亂不多時，就自動退去，凱然向對牀飛去，努力克服他們的目的物，在這時候，S可不忍再看B被其蹂躪，心裏也明日過來，這慘無人道的虫類，不是吮他就來刺我的，非决然去逐出暴徒，不能安睡枕藉，他就跳起身來，呌醒了B打開窗户，根本糞除室内，同時或逐或殺，蚊虫不必立足，奪門逃去，他倆才將窗户緊閉，才可各自安睡了，</p>

        <h1>1932.06.16</h1>
<h3>Lausanne Conference Opens Today</h3>
<p>Since the cessation of hostilities of the European Great War in 1918 until now, it has been thirteen and a half years. During these thirteen and a half years, although the European war has formally ceased, in reality, due to the turmoil of the war debt and reparations issues, the European political situation has remained in a state of tension, like a stormy sea. The diplomatic intrigue between nations has also been in a state of tension, characterized by open and covert struggles. To this day, as the contradictions have expanded and deepened, the issue has become increasingly difficult to resolve. From the Dawes Plan to the Young Plan to the current Lausanne Conference, all have sought to resolve this problem permanently and reasonably. In other words, they attempt to secure a more solid guarantee for this debt of blood. However, the impossibility of resolving this issue has persisted for thirteen years as if it were only one day. To this day, it continues to make diplomats and politicians fret and struggle to cope.</p>
<p>Was Germany solely responsible for the scourge of the Great War, or was it not? This debate is clearly futile today. "Justice always lies in the hands of the strong." The defeated nation is naturally blamed for the sins. To extract the flesh and blood of the entire nation to appease the victors' anger and to preserve a nation's dwindling lifeblood - who would say it is not appropriate? However, the culprits of the Great War are now mostly old and dying. The children and grandchildren are certainly innocent. To force innocent people to bear this endless exploitation, making them feel that their future is forever bleak and hopeless - can this be considered just, according to reason and humanity?</p>
<p>Today, France insists that since the end of the European war, it has spent a total of 175.5 billion francs to compensate for losses. Including interest, based on the current value of the franc, this amounts to about 250 billion francs. However, the amount of reparations paid by Germany, if the calculations are correct, is already close to 500 billion francs, of which 54% went to France. Regardless of the amount of compensation, the losses suffered by the Allied nations due to the Great War have long been recovered. Conversely, the Germans, who pay huge reparations annually, have their economy controlled and their industry and commerce strangled, and are already bled dry. However, the exploitation continues indefinitely. What justification is there for this endless exploitation?</p>
<p>Not only that, but in order for the Germans to scrape together flesh and blood to pay this blood debt, they have no choice but to sell their products. However, the Allied nations have all been working to raise tariff barriers, making it impossible for German products to find a market. Although they want to extract flesh and blood, they have no way to do so. Inevitably, the Germans have no choice but to stop paying reparations. "It is futile to ask people to produce what they do not have." Even the most demanding creditors should take into account the debtor's actual ability to pay.</p>
<p>The key to solving this problem, everyone knows, lies in America's war debts and France's desire to perpetually oppress Germany, preventing it from ever recovering. Therefore, the key to solving this problem lies with America and France. Last year, U.S. President Hoover proposed a one-year moratorium on war debts and reparations, allowing all nations to recover during this year. People generally praised him as a "wise creditor." However, this is not a fundamental solution. War debts and reparations have been postponed, but Germany's decline continues as before, and the world's decline continues as before. Therefore, if this wise creditor is truly wise, he should take further steps to find a fundamental solution. As for France's desire to control the Germans in the long term, regardless of whether it is ultimately impossible, even if it were possible, under such dire circumstances, Germany would inevitably undergo a transformation. If Germany undergoes a transformation, the whole of Europe and even the whole world will immediately be plunged into a whirlpool. Therefore, France's attempt to trap others will ultimately trap itself.</p>
<p>If America does not cancel its war debts, and France does not abandon its attempts to perpetually trap the Germans, then the reparations problem will be in vain, even after a hundred conferences. Now, there are also rumors that France intends to reoccupy the Ruhr region. What satisfactory results can the Lausanne Conference achieve?</p>

(15th dispatch) (Beiping) Lao Beifeng, San Sheng, Xiang Qingshan, Li Fenghua, and others are actively connecting with various righteous units. Xiang is the commander of the western Liaoning righteous army, with San Sheng as his deputy. Li is the commander of southern Liaoning, with Lao Beifeng as his deputy.

(15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the various units in Liaoning and Jilin have completed their connection, the three routes of righteous armies now number over 250,000. A deputy military commander's headquarters has been established in Jilin, guarded and overseen by Hao Yongsheng. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two Armies Continue to Clash South of Harbin</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, the recent anti-Manchu army that attacked Harbin numbered approximately 3,000. These troops are continuing to clash with Japanese troops in various locations five to ten miles south of Harbin, and the fighting has not yet ceased. For the past few days, the weather has been rainy and the ground wet, preventing Japanese aircraft from taking off. There have been battles in the Keshan area. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Transportation Between Harbin and Jilin Completely Cut Off</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Yesterday, the anti-Manchu army south of Harbin attacked the outposts of the "Manchukuo" army and the Japanese army, resulting in several minor clashes. Transportation between Harbin and Changchun was completely cut off from 9:00 PM to 7:00 AM. According to the Japanese military authorities, Harbin is not in danger. "Manchukuo" has now stopped recruiting new soldiers because several teams of new recruits recently deserted their posts during an emergency. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tonghua Occupied by the Big Sword Society</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) It is reported today that Tonghua has been occupied by the Big Sword Society.

<h3>Luo Wen'gan and Gu Weijun Return to Nanjing from Xunyang</h3>
<p>Gu Will Transfer to a Plane to Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Others Are Still at Lushan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan and Gu Weijun arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM today on the same plane. Gu immediately transferred to the Ford plane that came from Beiping yesterday to go to Shanghai. Wang Jingwei and others are resting at Lushan and will return to Nanjing in a few days. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Nanjing from Guling by plane on the afternoon of the 15th, Gu Weijun immediately transferred to a Ford plane to go to Shanghai to inspect the post-war situation in Shanghai, visit Guo Taiqi, and discuss everything. Those traveling with him include Liu Chongjie, Shi Zhaoji, You Mijian, and others. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 16th and go to Beiping on the 17th or 18th, and then go to Japan with the investigation team. It is also rumored that when Gu goes to Beiping from Nanjing, a portion of the central government's important figures will accompany him, to inspect the current situation in the north and meet with Zhang Xueliang to hold discussions. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan and Gu Weijun took a sedan chair from Guling at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 15th and arrived at Lianhua Cave at 11:30 AM. They transferred to a steamship and arrived in Jiujiang at 1:00 PM, and then took the original plane east and arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM. Those who welcomed them at the station included Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, Vice Foreign Minister Xu Mo, Secretary Xiang Shijie, and delegation members Liu Chongjie, You Mijian, and Shi Zhaoji. Luo said that Wang and others were unable to come because other political affairs still needed to be discussed with Jiang. Gu was anxious to go to Shanghai for discussions. The Ford plane sent from Beiping arrived at the airfield at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, with the delegation's foreign consultants Donner and Haas, and delegation members Xiao Jirong and Gu Shanchang, driven by Hurd. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun sent a telegram to Wang Guangqi, roughly stating that he would return to Nanjing from Lushan and go to Shanghai twice, and would be able to return to Beiping before the 18th. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun telegraphed for Councilor Xiao Jirong, Consultant Donner, and Gu Shanchang to bring important documents to Nanjing. This morning at 7:00 AM, Gu and others left Beiping and flew to Nanjing on Ford No. 1, for Gu to review. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Discussion of Diplomatic Issues at Lushan</h3>
<p>Wang Explains the Progress Agreed Upon in Nanjing (Nanjing) Wang Jingwei and five others arrived at Guling at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. After meeting with Jiang, they first discussed diplomatic issues that night. Gu Weijun reported in detail on the progress of the trip to the East, and Wang explained the progress agreed upon in Nanjing to deal with the situation. The talks lasted for four hours and ended at midnight. There was another round of final discussion on the morning of the 15th. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Luo Talks About the Excellent Results of This Trip</h3>
<p>There Are Already Avenues to Follow in Diplomatic Progress (Nanjing) Luo told visitors that the results of this trip were excellent and that there are already considerable avenues to follow in diplomatic progress. However, as the matter concerns foreign affairs and is still confidential, nothing can be revealed. He hopes that the people of the country will trust the government and quietly await the authorities' gradual progress. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter asked Luo what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would do about the passage of the recognition of Manchukuo by the Japanese House of Representatives. Luo replied that the so-called Manchukuo is known to the world to be completely under the control of the Japanese, and what difference does it make in reality whether or not Japan recognizes it? The Japanese government's recognition of the puppet state only makes the world more aware of the Japanese people's ambition to invade China. The Japanese government's violation of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty is even more obvious. Our country has prepared countermeasures and will naturally restrain it. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gu Will Not Accompany the Investigation Team to Japan</h3>
<p>Who Else Will Be Sent Has Not Yet Been Decided (Nanjing) Gu Weijun said that the impression of this trip was quite good and that the government has made concrete decisions regarding diplomatic policy. After he returns to Beiping, he will continue to investigate the unfinished work. He has been deeply affected by what he has seen in the Northeast. He has submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding accompanying the team to Japan. Who else will be sent has not yet been decided. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The members of the Chinese delegation will depart by sea to Japan after the investigation team leaves Beiping. (15th dispatch) (Beiping) The American representative visited the President of Yenching University, Stuart, this afternoon and had a long conversation. Lord Lytton was at a banquet at the British Embassy this afternoon. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lord Lytton visited Wang Guangqi at the Diplomatic Affairs Office this morning and talked for a long time, discussing the review of documents when compiling the report. The team will still follow the Beining Railway through the three eastern provinces to Korea, cross the sea to Japan, and is expected to stay in Japan for a maximum of ten days before returning to Beiping. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomat said that after the signing of the Shanghai Incident Agreement, people generally believed that the national crisis was over and ignored the Northeast Incident. In fact, the East Incident is even more serious than the Shanghai Incident. A slight negligence will lead to danger. If we do not pay attention to it during its management period, the consequences will be even more unthinkable in the future, and it may even evolve into a second entry of Manchus into the Central Plains. Therefore, at this time, the people of the country should have a spirit of拼命, hold on with perseverance, and wait for the opportunity. It is never possible to rely on psychology. Currently, the diplomatic path is nothing more than putting in a lot of effort with the League of Nations and various countries. However, in reality, it still requires the efforts of the people of the country to be effective. After returning from the Northeast, the investigation team informally told Representative Gu that, try looking at Beiping and Tianjin, where people are singing and dancing and living in peace, how many know the suffering of your country's Northeast? If your country does nothing, why should we foreigners worry about it? It can be seen that if the people of the country do not strive to improve themselves, even foreigners will not help us. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Issue of Restoring Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Our Side Intends to Proceed Using Other Methods (Nanjing) Our side had decided on two steps to take in order to proceed with the issue of restoring Sino-Russian diplomatic relations. However, because the newspapers disclosed it too early, it caused misunderstandings on the other side. It is now heard that our side intends to proceed using other methods for this matter and is currently considering it. Also, Representative Mo is still recuperating in Italy and does not seem to be going to Russia anytime soon. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Committee members staying in Guangdong have been meeting for days to discuss the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with Russia. They all believe that with the current situation in China, it is impossible to find a way out without restoring diplomatic relations with Russia. However, after the restoration of diplomatic relations, it is still necessary to make every effort to prevent the invasion of the Communist Party. The various committee members will telegraph this intention to the Central Committee. (15th dispatch)</p>

<p>British House of Commons Inquires</p>
<h3>Agenda of the Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>London When the House of Commons met today, National Liberal Party member of parliament Mendel asked Foreign Secretary Eden several questions, asking the government not to include matters closely related to restoring peace in Shanghai on the agenda of the Round Table Conference, and said that all other disputes should be left to Geneva for discussion when a complete solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute is reached. Eden replied that the agenda of any meeting on Shanghai cannot be decided by the UK alone, but must be agreed upon with other participating countries. He also mentioned that on May 26, he had answered Labour MP Jones' question about negotiating with the Japanese government in order for the powers to discuss the agenda of the Shanghai Round Table Conference in Tokyo, in accordance with the recommendation of the League of Nations Executive Council on February 29. It can be referred to. At that time, Eden had said that the Japanese Foreign Minister had recently initiated confidential discussions with the ambassadors of several countries stationed in Tokyo to hold the Shanghai Round Table Conference in accordance with the recommendations of the League of Nations Executive Council on February 29. This discussion cannot be said to be a negotiation, so Eden also said in his reply that this meeting cannot be held without the participation of the Chinese government, and the agenda has not yet been considered, but once convened, it must follow the principles established by the League of Nations General Assembly's resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute.

The property of debtors should be investigated by the judges themselves. If an auction is necessary, the price must be fair and not too high to avoid no one bidding, nor too low to cause unexpected losses to the debtor. However, cases that must be suspended in accordance with laws and regulations should still be handled with care and should not be dismissed lightly on the pretext of closing the case.

<h3>Jiang Zuobin to Cross to Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zuobin left Nanjing for Shanghai at noon on the 15th to prepare to cross to Japan. According to talks, recently, all parties have opposed the name of the Round Table Conference promoted by the Japanese, believing it to be humiliating and detrimental to national sovereignty. It would be more appropriate to use the name International Conference. In my personal opinion, the appropriateness of holding a conference does not lie in the name, but in the substance. If the conference can fairly resolve the entire Sino-Japanese issue at the same time, then an International Conference is acceptable, and a Round Table Conference is also acceptable. In short, the sole condition must be that it does not harm sovereignty or national humiliation, otherwise it will not be approved. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Drafts Fiscal Reorganization Plan</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Gu Zhutong recently told reporters that our resignation has been comforted and retained by the central government, and has been instructed to propose a fiscal reorganization plan. If there is no way to solve the financial problems, Luo's retention will be useless. However, before the problem is resolved, he will still be responsible for maintaining the provincial administration. The fiscal reorganization plan is currently being drafted, and it generally includes nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The fundamental solution is to clear up land taxes, which is the most important. The stopgap measure is to improve the business tax to offset the loss of the abolition of customs duties.

<h3>LAUSANNE CONFERENCE OPENS TODAY</h3>
<p>Resolving the Issue of Reparations and War Debts</p>
<p>German Delegation Arrives First</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 15th Telegram: Although the Lausanne Conference is scheduled to open tomorrow, informal meetings will begin tonight. The leaders and representatives of the nine countries will meet at the hotel where MacDonald is staying to discuss the conference agenda. According to well-informed sources, it is expected that after the opening speeches, general debates will be limited to four or five days at most. Then, a committee will be organized to study the proposals and solutions put forward during the debates from financial and political aspects separately. The committee meetings are expected to last for ten days, so it is hoped that tangible results can be achieved by the beginning of July. Tomorrow's meeting will be held at 10:00 AM in the assembly hall of the Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel. The Swiss President, Motta, will personally welcome the representatives. After the opening ceremony, the meeting will be adjourned and a closed-door meeting will be held at the nearby Château d'Ouchy Hotel. The German delegation arrived here this morning, being the first of the four major powers to arrive. The Italian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Grandi, arrived this afternoon. The British and French delegations will arrive this afternoon. National News Agency, Paris, 15th Telegram: Germany and its nine creditor nations will meet at the Lausanne Conference tomorrow. Germany is determined to declare its inability to pay reparations any further. However, since last year when US President Hoover proposed a one-year moratorium, world economic experts have successively confirmed at the Berlin Debtors' Conference that Germany is in dire straits, but it cannot yet be said to be bankrupt. This is because the banking experts who studied the German budget last year all knew that Germans still had considerable assets abroad. However, the experts' report admitted that the exact amount of these foreign assets could not be known for sure. It is roughly estimated to be 60 billion marks, of which about 50 billion is in long-term foreign investments, but it may be far more than this, and it is also impossible to know. The report of the Debtors' Conference contains a report from the German Assets Subcommittee, stating that the interest earned by Germans from foreign investments is between 300 million and 400 million marks. Although, in addition to the debts under the Young Plan, Germany also has huge foreign debts. According to the report of the statistical subcommittee in the View Conference report, Germany's short and long-term foreign debts are currently between, and the annual interest payable is also between 1.6 billion and 1.85 billion marks. The interest on short-term debts alone has reached 700 million marks, which is even greater than the unconditional reparations stipulated by the Young Plan. Even if calculated at the lowest amount, assuming that Germany's annual foreign debt interest is 1.6 billion marks, it is almost the same as the 1.6721 billion marks of reparations due this year as stipulated by the Young Plan. Therefore, experts and politicians gathered in Lausanne tomorrow will face two major problems when studying Germany's solvency: how will the 1.6 billion marks of reparations stipulated by the Young Plan be raised, and how will the 1.6 billion marks of annual foreign debt interest be raised? In addition, although Germany's current budget has a huge deficit, its budget amount has increased surprisingly in recent years, with public construction costs, education costs, and community service costs accounting for 43% of total expenditures. This sudden increase in expenditure is expected to cause fierce debate at the conference.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 14th Telegram: Today, a large group of people gathered at the Anhalter Bahnhof to bid farewell to the German delegation to the Lausanne Conference. When the delegation arrived at the platform and the train departed, they all shouted "Do not give in" to encourage them. The delegation is led by Chancellor Papen, and the others are Foreign Minister Neurath, Finance Minister Kroosigk, Minister of Economic Affairs Warmbold, and Vice Foreign Minister Pülu. Hamburg banker Merckiah accompanies them as a financial advisor. In addition, there are many members of relevant departments. The German newspapers are now focused on domestic politics and rarely comment on the Lausanne Conference, only repeatedly stating that Germany is unable to pay reparations any further and that this time they will not seek a permanent solution to the entire issue. The German newspaper "Die Welt" warned against being overly optimistic about the future of the conference, thinking that the British and French agreement may not necessarily be seen as a reduction in the thorns on the road ahead for Germany's claims. On the contrary, it may well be seen as France gathering its allies and doing its best to isolate Germany.</p>
<h3>THE CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT, A GAME OF DECEIT</h3>
<p>Representatives Hold Private Talks to Exchange Views</p>
<p>Nothing More Than Delaying Time and Quietly Waiting for the Outcome of the Lausanne Conference</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 14th Telegram: Today, the main body of the Disarmament Conference adopted the suggestion of French Prime Minister Herriot and decided not to convene the General Committee. Herriot proposed that the representatives first hold private talks again and then reconvene the conference after finding a suitable basis for continued negotiations. Tonight, it is generally believed here that this decision by the main body of the conference is tantamount to announcing the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference. It is actually a formal endorsement of the policy of temporarily delaying time and quietly waiting for the outcome of the Lausanne Conference as a means of prolonging life. The disarmament issue will be resolved together with the reparations and war debts issues at the Lausanne Conference.</p>
<h3>THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WILL PROPOSE A NEW PLAN</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources, British Prime Minister MacDonald will propose a detailed plan at the Lausanne Conference to conclude a European convention in the manner of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, including a provision for a ten-year suspension of the arms race. MacDonald plans that after this agreement is reached, the Disarmament Conference will convene a meeting to formally pass it. After that, the Disarmament Conference can be adjourned indefinitely or issue a formal declaration announcing that the task has been temporarily completed in order to conclude. However, whether this plan can be realized will depend entirely on the approval of Italy and Germany. However, it is expected that Germany may not agree, as it would guarantee France's existing military strength and extend the principle of inequality.</p>
<h3>GERMAN REPRESENTATIVE REAFFIRMS DISARMAMENT STANCE</h3>
<p>As for Germany's attitude towards disarmament, the German representative Nadolny presented a resolution in the main body of the conference today, reaffirming Germany's demand for a reduction in armaments of a qualitative nature and the abolition of military aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery to comply with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles regarding German disarmament. When presenting this proposal, the German representative emphasized that since technical discussions have yielded no results, the best course of action now is to apply the methods stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles for dealing with Germany to the disarmament issue. This method is most likely to achieve tangible results. Then, French Prime Minister Herriot stood up to oppose, firmly stating that France could not agree to any disarmament plan that took the disarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles as a starting point, and that the disarmament issue could only be resolved through direct negotiations.</p>
<h3>US ADVOCATES FOR A 10% REDUCTION IN ARMAMENTS</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th Telegram: The delegations of various countries attending the Disarmament Conference are very active, and various parties are currently engaged in unofficial talks. The United States has proposed a reduction of at least 10% in the strength of the army, navy, and air force. In the past month, the British and American general staffs have discussed this matter and exchanged views. The General Affairs Committee of the Disarmament Conference has decided to convene a plenary meeting only after the unofficial talks currently underway have made some headway. The content of the unofficial talks is currently unknown to the outside world.</p>
<h3>US REPUBLICAN CONVENTION</h3>
<p>Chairman Tries to Avoid Mentioning the Prohibition Issue</p>
<p>Ms. Adams Leads a Peace Parade</p>
<p>National News, Chicago, 14th Telegram: The 1932 Republican National Convention was held here today. Everything went smoothly and no disturbances occurred. Although several hundred communists paraded and demonstrated near the conference hall during the meeting, they dispersed after being persuaded by the police once and gradually retreated to areas further away from the venue. At that time, Ms. Adams, originally a famous leader of social services, also led various organizations that support peace and freedom in a peace parade. They stopped at various places to speak to the crowd and criticize war or the world's arms race. Many communists and socialists participated in this parade. After the convention opened, Iowa Senator Dickinson delivered the main speech, in which he praised President Hoover's stable policies, but did not mention the prohibition issue. After Dickinson finished his speech, the convention began to organize the various subcommittees and soon announced an adjournment until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 14th Telegram: The National Republican Convention opened here this morning. The flags of the 48 states of the United States were hung in the venue, and a wireless machine that broadcasts around the world was installed. Representatives from various states sang and cheered, and it was a grand occasion. The issue of amending the Prohibition Act had long aroused fierce controversy. The forces of the repeal faction may overwhelm the entire venue. Hoover's faction, guided by Secretary of War Hurley, is doing its best to mediate, trying to find a compromise between those who advocate immediate repeal and those who advocate resubmitting the issue to a national referendum. Those who hold the second view are in the majority. As for the prohibition faction, which was able to dominate all parties four years ago, it has already been half defeated. President Hoover's views on the prohibition laws are not in line with those of some members of his party, so Convention Chairman Dickinson avoided the prohibition issue in his opening remarks, only proposing that the party still nominate Hoover as its presidential candidate and advocating that the United States should protect the gold standard.</p>
<h3>FRENCH CASH RESERVES IN THE US ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY WITHDRAWN</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 14th Telegram: Except for Swiss currency, the prices of all countries' currencies are now below the cash export price point. Today, the United States exported and withdrew cash for export totaling $54 million, the largest amount since last September. Of this, $50 million was withdrawn by the Bank of France. It is generally believed that the cash previously stored by France in the United States has almost been completely withdrawn. The total amount stored by the United States is approximately $390 million, and $92 million has been lost in the past twelve months. Cash outflow has been greater this year, with $57.5 million lost in five and a half months. It is estimated that there are still $800 million in short-term deposits in the United States by foreigners, of which $500 million is stored by European countries, and $150 million is stored by Americans. The Federal Reserve Bank's "free cash" that can be used for withdrawals totals $1 billion. It is generally expected that the number of withdrawals by foreigners will not exceed $200 million thereafter, because depositors other than Europeans and British depositors have not indicated that they will withdraw their deposits, and European countries must store at least $150 million in the United States to meet the needs of ordinary commerce.</p>
<h3>SIR ROBERT HOTUNG EXPLAINS THE CHINESE SITUATION IN LONDON</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th Telegram: Since arriving in London, Sir Robert Hotung has been working hard to explain the Chinese situation to the British business, financial, and shipping communities. Today, the Chinese Consul General hosted a lunch to entertain him, with Minister Shih Chao-chi in attendance. Sir Robert Hotung may travel to the European continent in a few weeks and then return to Hong Kong via the United States by boat. He was recently hired by the Chinese government as an advisor.</p>
<h3>BERLIN YOUTH COMMUNISTS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST THE JAPANESE</h3>
<p>Burst into a Japanese Club with Handguns</p>
<p>Shouting "Down with Japanese Imperialism"</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th Telegram: Last night, five Communist youths, wearing uniforms of the Red Shock Troop Alliance that had been dissolved by the authorities, suddenly broke into a Japanese club. The German doorman tried to stop them, but they refused to listen. At that time, the people in the club were having dinner. The five youths went straight to the dining room with the doorman, shouting "Down with Japanese imperialism!" They suddenly took out handguns and opened fire on the diners. Fortunately, no one was injured. The Japanese were startled and tried to drive the visitors away, but they were subdued by the handguns and retreated to a corner of the room, guarded by three youths. The other two went to each room to destroy objects, and finally went to the billiard room, where they wrote in large white letters on the blackboard: "If the Japanese challenge Soviet Russia in the Far East, they will send all Japanese imperialists to see the devil." At this time, a person who had not been seen by the five youths took the opportunity to report to the police, but when the police arrived, the five youths had already disappeared. Their coming and going were so erratic, as if they were in no man's land, even in the busy streets of the city. Afterwards, the police station sent more than forty detectives to search overnight, but no clues have been found so far.</p>
<h3>THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE THREE FISCAL EMERGENCY ORDERS</h3>
<p>Cutting Unemployment Relief and Increasing New Taxes</p>
<p>The States Oppose Revoking the Ban on Storm Troopers</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th Telegram: The 1932 German budget can be balanced thanks to the active emergency orders issued recently. The total amount is 8.2 billion marks. Three more emergency orders must be issued this week, cutting spending on social services, even more than what Brüning proposed. The first order will be issued today, reducing unemployment benefits by 12% to 23%. Unemployed people who still have no work after enjoying six weeks of assistance will have to undergo a test. War pensions and orphan support will also be reduced. Those who receive wages and salaries will have to pay a tax of 1.5% to 6.5% on their income. Salt will be taxed more, and any business, even the smallest, will have to pay sales tax. The government claims that it will no longer collect new taxes, because too many taxes will reduce revenue. Therefore, the remedy is to reduce national government expenses, and the government will restore the domestic market in various ways.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 14th Telegram: The German emergency order to maintain public safety was suddenly postponed. The reason is that the state governments oppose revoking the ban on dissolving the National Socialist Storm Troopers. It still needs to be cleared by the Minister of the Interior, so it must be postponed for a few days.</p>
<h3>JAPANESE EXTRAORDINARY DIET CLOSES</h3>

<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Telegram: The problem of Adachi Kenzō's reinstatement is gradually becoming serious. Centered on this issue, a major upheaval is about to break out within the Minseito party, and President Wakatsuki is quite embarrassed.</p>
<h3>SPANISH GOVERNMENT ORDERS CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY OF DEPOSED KING</h3>

Movable and immovable property will be preserved by the National Property Custody Committee. Anyone with property of the deposed king must hand it over to the state.</p>

People rushed forward to help him up, but he was already dead. The whole House was shocked and immediately adjourned.</p>

He was a non-combatant American citizen who was shot down and killed by Japanese aircraft in the skies over Suzhou.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Mysteries of the Northeast K.</h3>
<p>(2) To the Ideal New Manchurian-Mongolian Land</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have regarded the Northeast as if Columbus had discovered America, and were overjoyed. A common slogan on newspapers and lecture platforms was "Go to the ideal new Manchurian-Mongolian land!"</p>
<p>The Japanese originally had an intense interest in studying the Northeast and constantly went there for on-the-ground investigations. However, from this year onward, this interest has become even more pronounced. In the past two or three months, as many as 45 groups have gone to the Northeast for investigation, with a total of 1,043 members. Among the aforementioned groups, with the exception of only three student groups which had the nature of holiday travel, the rest were for special purposes, such as the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Osaka Industrial Association, the Osaka Manchurian-Mongolian Trade Merchants Association, Oji Paper, Fuji Paper, and other paper manufacturing enterprises, which are all extremely powerful in the Japanese business community. As for individual investigations, such as officials, parliamentarians, scholars, soldiers, as well as experts in railways, shipping, transportation, banking, mining, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and soybeans, the stream was endless and countless. Among them, the newly appointed President of the Oriental Development Company, Takayama Nagayuki, is one of the most noteworthy figures. In addition, newly published materials about the Northeast are also flooding bookstores, such as "Treasury Sumong's Invitation," "Manchuria's Small Capital Business Guide," "Manchuria's New National Affairs," "Manchukuo Travel Guide," "Manchuria-Mongolia's New Nation and Our Lifeline," "Can We Not Develop in Manchuria-Mongolia?" etc. The content is all tempting, enough to be a guide for Japanese people to go to the Northeast. How to turn the Northeast into the second Korea is also discussed in detail in the books.</p>
<p>Since the Russo-Japanese War, Japan has expanded its militarism, using the pretext of overpopulation, implementing aggressive means. However, due to the rejection of colored races by continents such as America and Australia, it has been repeatedly restricted. Therefore, it turned to our country's Eastern Provinces as its outlet, becoming a unified national opinion of the Japanese government and the public. The initial plan was to immigrate 500,000 people every year, believing that it could reach 10 million in 20 years. However, the results were contrary to expectations, and the results were not good. The standard of living in the Northeast was too low to arouse the envy of Japanese farmers, and Japan was not without arable land, so they inevitably settled back on their native land. At the same time, our country's Zhili and Shandong provinces suffered from famines year after year, and refugees arrived like a tide, regarding the Northeast as a paradise. A comparison is sufficient to prove the failure of its immigration ideal. The following table lists the number of population increases in Dalian in the past 18 years for reference:</p>

<p>Republic of China Year 18 90,003 250,091</p>
<p>Dalian is the largest city in the Eastern Provinces that Japan has painstakingly managed, and it is also the center for implementing immigration policies. After many years of effort, the Japanese have only increased by 50,000 people, while the Chinese have increased to 170,000 people. The situation of the Japanese population outside Dalian, according to the statistics of the 18th year of the Republic of China, is</p>
<p>Dalian 90,003</p>
<p>Kwantung State (excluding Dalian) 15,609</p>
<p>Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area 93,988</p>
<p>Consulate Area 4,993</p>
<p>Subtotal 194,993</p>
<p>Scattered in the Interior 7,954</p>
<p>Total 202,547</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Japanese residing in Manchuria and Mongolia are still mostly in Dalian and near the Manchurian Railway, and the number scattered in the interior is very small. Moreover, more than half of these 200,000 people are officials and employees of the Manchurian Railway, rather than those who are moving there for economic reasons. Therefore, the Japanese often say that the Eastern Provinces are their lifeline for solving the population problem, which proves that it is completely false. The Northeast is the lifeline of our Chinese people, which is a fact.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese will never diminish their ambition because of this. Based on the lessons learned above, the newly formulated immigration policy has changed its direction as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To take group immigration as the principle and strive to prevent dispersion, that is, to move an entire village or a large group.</p>
<p>(2) To implement the Tuntian system, combining soldiers and farmers, so that the lives and property of immigrants have extremely secure guarantees.</p>
<p>(3) To advocate self-cultivation and increase the types of plants, so that immigrants can be self-sufficient and live a prosperous life.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to providing various conveniences to immigrant groups, also grant subsidies and establish agricultural banks to give them full financial adjustment.</p>
<p>(5) To seek complete cultural facilities, so that immigrants feel satisfied with their lives and have the determination to stay permanently, without any thoughts of homesickness.</p>
<p>According to the announcement by Yamaoka Nosuke, the Governor of Kwantung Territory, the number of immigrants is at least 300,000 households, or 1.5 million people. The area to accommodate these immigrants is roughly in the Yanji area, so that Jilin and Korea can be integrated. The vanguard of the first batch of immigrants has already departed from Japan this month. It is heard that the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs plans to add a Manchurian-Mongolian Bureau to specialize in investigating the current situation in Manchuria and Mongolia, provide immigration information, and receive the entrustment of other businesses. On the one hand, it will establish a "branch office" in Shenyang as a liaison agency, and establish a training center in Jinzhou to provide immigrants with a kind of training. The scale of the project is great and can be imagined.</p>
<p>Currently, the Japanese have collected 20 million yuan specifically for rural development. It is said that they will sign an agricultural contract between countries with the puppet state, recognize private land ownership, and allow free buying and selling. Looking at the announcements issued by various counties, there is the saying "Now the door is open, and investment from all countries is welcome. Those who have land but are unable to cultivate it can freely rent it to foreigners," which is not without reason. The methods opened in the announcement are copied below:</p>
<p>(1) Those who want to rent out their land can immediately sign a permanent lease contract, with a lease of 30 years. During this period, they are not allowed to withdraw the lease midway, causing intangible losses to agriculture.</p>
<p>(2) This is not the period of the old warlords. Farmers do not need to be wary of selling the country.</p>
<p>(3) When renting, the village chief and four neighbors must endorse the contract, and there must be a deed as proof. If it is public land in the village council, the village directors must all endorse the contract.</p>
<p>(4) When renting out, it must be reported to the county government, which will send personnel to supervise, guide, and demarcate the boundaries to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>Liaoyang, Shenyang, Tieling, Kaiyuan, Benxi, Fengcheng, and Haicheng are all the most fertile areas in Liaoning, rich in products, which the Japanese have coveted for a long time. Because Japan lacks food, it wants to obtain it from the Northeast, so it has a plan to use the special skills of Koreans to change dry land into paddy fields. Recently, Showa Zaibatsu and other companies have come forward to enclose land on a large scale along the Hunhe River and Taizi River, giving a price of 20 to 30 yuan per mu, and not in cash. If there is any resistance, they will be charged with obstructing rice fields. Farmers in various counties, whose livelihoods are about to be destroyed, have expressed opposition one after another, and a public petition carrying weapons has occurred in Liaoyang, and the situation is very serious. However, the number of Koreans who have moved to the Manchurian Railway line has recently reached 100,000, and there are still 500,000 unemployed Koreans in Japan who are in urgent need of relief and will soon be recruited. The current preparatory work is to dig canals to divert water, with the expenses paid by the government, and after the harvest, donations will be collected on a per-mu basis. On the one hand, motor roads are being built, requiring farmers along the road to send one person each. Those who are unwilling to send people must pay money. 100,000 mu in Emeizhuang and Balizhuang areas of Liaoyang have been designated as the initial paddy field test site. Relying on the power of the Japanese police, the situation of the Koreans is very different from before. A Korean association has been established in Tieling, and branches have been established everywhere. In Teng'aobao, Liuxitun, and Qilingzi of Haicheng, the Japanese government needs to spend more than 10 million yuan a year to add four consulates, five consular branches, and eleven consular offices, and must also set up a "Korean Garrison," which is quite impressive. Strange, haven't the "commercial lease rights" and "Manchurian-Korean co-residence" issues that have been debated for many years become meaningless now?</p>
<p>Our country's farmers are diligent and hardworking, and the Japanese are by no means their opponents. In order to implement the immigration policy, Japan must also prevent Chinese laborers from entering the country. Therefore, the puppet state will soon implement a nationality law, stipulating that those who are not native-born will not be recognized as having citizenship rights, and even if they apply for naturalization, they will still be subject to review. The detailed articles, when I was in the Northeast, had not yet been announced. However, after reading the instructions received by various counties on "cracking down on foreigners entering the country," it is clear how cruel the Japanese methods are. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>"It has been found that although foreigners entering the country are not all to be prevented, every time the settlement period arrives, laborers from Shandong and other places of the Republic of China move into the country. The quality is uneven, and it is inevitable that plainclothes teams are mixed in, which is difficult to identify. At the beginning of the construction of the new country, it is necessary to prevent security and public health. The headquarters is comprehensively planning the method of cracking down on the entry of such people. Before the method is promulgated, when the aforementioned laborers enter the country, it is necessary to strictly crack down on them. Those who do not have passports and guarantees, or who do not have the financial resources and guarantees are not reliable, should be prevented from entering the country in order to maintain security and emphasize hygiene. It is necessary to order the police officers serving on the border to abide by and handle it."</p>
<p>In the past, the Northeast Transportation Committee had preferential regulations for immigrants for taking vehicles. Depending on the place of destination, some were free of charge, and some were half-price. As for the transportation of agricultural tools, all were completely free of charge. Since the Japanese took over, they have canceled this regulation. The Red Swastika Society has negotiated with the Japanese many times for sending away the refugees after the September 18th Incident, but it has not been accommodated in the slightest. After investigation, Koreans, if they hold a certificate from the Japanese consulate or police officer, can still enjoy this kind of preferential treatment. The methods are two-pronged, and it is extremely unfair. What is even more infuriating is that the Yanji area has become a deformed development, that is, there are more Koreans and fewer Chinese. In the corner of Jiandao, there are only 100,000 Chinese, while there are 400,000 Koreans. Therefore, the Japanese have a great momentum of taking over the host's position in the area. Recently, they have often created an atmosphere of intimidation in the name of searching for gangsters or righteous armies, so timid Chinese have abandoned their family property and left. Also, because border inspections are very strict, they are not allowed to carry many items, so they have to pack their belongings into packages and entrust them to the post office for delivery. Japan has already violated the treaty by setting up 13 police stations in the area, and now it has added 5 more. Any Chinese they consider to have suspicious behavior are often tied up on the road and declared missing from then on. Sturdy Chinese houses are often designated as places where bad people can be hidden, and they are bombed and destroyed for no reason. Like the two or three hundred families in Erdaogou, it has now become rubble, just like Zhabei in Shanghai. In the face of such inhumanity, what other method do our people have besides relocation?</p>
<p>From this point of view, our people not only have no hope of migrating to the Northeast in the future, but also the laborers who have already migrated to the Northeast will have to be driven out by the Japanese. Looking at the statistics of the number of people coming and going from the port of Dalian this spring, it is easy to prove that my words are by no means alarmist.</p>
<p>(A) The number of people who came to the Northeast via Dalian decreased by 6,645.</p>
<p>January: Men 12,303, women 1,575, total 13,878, an increase of 347 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>February: Men 16,637, women 1,654, total 18,291, an increase of 8,791 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>March: Men 35,047, women 3,502, total 38,549, a decrease of 15,703 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>(B) The number of people who went to the Northeast via Dalian increased by 43,515.</p>
<p>January: Men 39,088, women 3,213, total 42,301, an increase of 22,451 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>February: Men 17,826, women 1,343, total 19,168, an increase of 7,498 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>March: Men 24,875, women 2,508, total 37,383, an increase of 13,666 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>In just three months, many ports in Yingkou and Andong are not included. The number of Chinese people who came minus the number who left totals as many as 50,000. In this regard alone, the Japanese facade of "coexistence and co-prosperity" that they have been singing to deceive our people has now been completely exposed, and has become a synonym for "either me or you" and "you die and I live."</p>
<p>Since the resolution of the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese army has almost all gone to the Northeast. On the one hand, the ability to suppress our people has suddenly increased. On the other hand, Japanese merchants and ronin have also followed. In addition to many Japanese stores, restaurants (i.e., brothels), barbershops, opium dens, casinos, etc. have also sprung up everywhere. At the same time, military post offices have also been established, and Japanese police have also appeared on the market, as if it has become Japanized. Oh my, I don't know what kind of situation this is. In the market of Harbin, there are already Doihara Street and Domon Street. Near the Eastern Mausoleum of Shenyang, Nogimura is about to be built. The newly built road outside the East Gate of Jinzhou is called so-and-so thoroughfare and so-and-so town. The ambition of Japan, this is enough to prove the extreme expression.

<h3>Japanese Goods in the Yangtze River are Slow to Sell</h3>
<p>Japanese merchants in Chengdu, Chongqing, etc.</p>
<p>Are now closing their businesses and returning to their home country</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun said that in the three towns of Wuhan, as many as 4,000 households have gone bankrupt due to the anti-Japanese movement, and the commerce of Changsha, Hunan, has also plummeted. Changsha was originally an important city in the Yangtze River region. Since it was ravaged by the communists and resisted by the Iron Blood Corps, Chinese merchants engaged in the business of Japanese goods are in the same situation as Wuhan. Even Japanese merchants are all sitting idle, with no income. To this day, there is still no improvement. On the May 9th Anniversary Day, anti-Japanese goods speeches were held in the area, and the momentum was very fierce. Currently, the trade in the area is monopolized by British merchants. The ports in the upper reaches of Yichang and Shashi, and the ports in the lower reaches of Jiujiang and Wuxue, are also in a state of transaction stagnation. Therefore, Japanese merchants in Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian, Changde, Xiangtan, and other places have had to close their businesses and return to their home country. The Yangtze River upper reaches markets, where we once occupied an important position, have almost fallen into a desperate situation. Now that the Shanghai Armistice Agreement has been established, Japanese goods merchants are still unable to move freely. Although the general intention of Chinese merchants is happy to sell Japanese goods, the situation of Japanese goods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has declined year by year. If you want to restore the previous state, I am afraid that the situation is impossible.</p>
<h3>Xu Tingyao Goes to Zhengyang to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>The Ninth Division is about to arrive in Bengbu. A dispatch from Bengbu reports that Xu Tingyao, the commander of the Fourth Division of the Army stationed in the city, was ordered to lead his troops to Zhengyang to suppress bandits. The Guan and Wang brigades under his command have successively moved west by water and land and have already arrived in Zhengyang. Today (14th) afternoon, Xu Tingyao also led the staff of the division headquarters, boarded a ship and went west along the Huai River to Zhengyang. The officers and soldiers of the battalions and companies directly under the division headquarters, such as the engineers, logistics, and special forces, also followed by boat to the west. After most of the Fourth Division was transferred, the Liang Kai unit of the Second Replacement Regiment and the Du Yuming unit of the 24th Regiment of the 12th Brigade were left to garrison Bengbu. The security task was originally scheduled to be the responsibility of the Deputy Division Commander Xing Zhennan. Before Xing arrived in the city, it was assumed by Regiment Commander Du Yuming. The Bengbu Garrison Headquarters still exists. The Li Yannian unit of the Ninth Division, which was transferred from Jiashan, Zhejiang, to Bengbu to take over the defense, is already on its way. Li has also sent the staff officer of the division headquarters, He Yinghua, etc., to Bengbu to survey the barracks. It is reported that the Li Xiangrong unit of the 25th Brigade of the unit has arrived in Pukou and boarded the train. Tonight (14th), a regiment can arrive. The Zheng Zuomin unit of the 26th Brigade, the Zhou Kaixun unit of the Independent Brigade, and the artillery battalion, engineer battalion, logistics battalion, cavalry company, special service company, and various departments of the division headquarters will arrive one after another.

<h3>Severe Hail Disaster in Lushi, Henan</h3>
<p>Both wheat crops are destroyed and fruit trees are completely stripped. A dispatch from Kaifeng reports that the Provincial Relief Association received a telegram from the Lushi County Government stating that according to Chen Jinyu, the district chief of the Second District, and He Guilin, the head of the district regiment, at noon on the first of this month, the east wind roared, and dark clouds gathered. First, heavy rain came suddenly, followed by hailstones falling together, like peaches and eggs. After a while, the storm stopped. The area from Pingfan Township in the east to Yingxian Town in the west, and from Zili Township in the south to Zizhi Township in the north, all stretches for more than a hundred li. The three townships of Pingfan, Zili, and Zizhi were the most severely affected. The two wheat crops were broken and destroyed, and the autumn seedlings were devastated. Thinking back to the severe drought last winter and spring, the people who have long suffered from hunger and cold were fortunate that the two wheat crops were successful and celebrated their regeneration. However, Heaven did not pity them, and a hail disaster suddenly struck. How can those who survived the disaster bear it? In addition to going to the disaster area with the relief branch to investigate and provide relief, they should truthfully report the situation and request approval and relief. Subsequently, a micro-telegram was received from the county, stating that according to the district chief of the Fifth District, in Wenhe Township of this district, at 3 pm on June 1, with the sound of thunder, black clouds spread. First, rain and hail fell together, followed by pure hail without rain. The large ones were like fists, and the small ones were like eggs. The accumulation on the flat ground was eight or nine inches, and the accumulation in the gullies was two or three feet. The two wheat crops were destroyed, the fruit trees were shaken off, and many livestock and people were injured. Disasters have been caused by bandits and droughts for years, and the people have suffered from food shortages. Now, the hail disaster is extremely severe. Woe to my compatriots. What can we do? In addition to providing relief, we hereby ask the council to verify and quickly provide urgent relief to save the people from disaster. It is heard that after the council received two reports from the county, it telegraphed and appealed to all parties to raise funds for relief.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Binhai Reclamation Plan</h3>
<p>Rong Zongjing and others go to the provincial capital to discuss Zhenjiang communications. Rong Zongjing, Miao Bin, the former director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhang Shouyong, the director of the Finance Department, and others, arrived in Zhenjiang from Wuxi yesterday (14th) to discuss the reclamation of coastal salt land with Gu Zhutong, the chairman of the provincial government. That evening, Gu hosted a banquet for Rong in the provincial residence, and also invited He Yushu, the director of the Industry Department, to accompany him. During the banquet, they discussed plans to create a large-scale salt reclamation organization to develop agricultural production in Jiangsu. In recent years, although the crops produced in Jiangsu farmland have been reduced due to natural disasters, according to detailed investigations, even if there is no famine year, the people of Jiangsu do not have enough food, but the coastal wasteland is abandoned without reclamation, or even if it is reclaimed, the protection is not comprehensive, causing the people not to dare to invest and losing infinite sources of profit. If the government cooperates with the people, planting cotton or wheat is very suitable. It is reported that Huainan was originally a salt-producing area. In the past 30 years, the coast has moved eastward, and brine cannot be irrigated inland. The former salt land has become grassland. Nantong Zhang Jian had foreseen this, so there was the organization of the Salt Reclamation Company, but it was not easy to make a profit at the beginning. In recent years, bandits have disturbed the area, and farmers are not at ease in their fields. The company has also failed to collect rent from the tenants on time. If the people of Jiangsu pay attention to this, it will also solve one of the important policies of people's livelihood. (15th)</p>
<p>Local Communication</p>
<h3>Chongming</h3>
<p>Principal Jingcun is Accused. Lu Zhenfeng, the principal of Jingcun Elementary School in the Third District of Chongming County, was accused by local gentry Gong Fangpei, Gu Zunxian, and others of eight counts of corruption and incompetence in school management and submitted to the county bureau. After Liu Mingxiao, the director of the county education bureau, went to the school to investigate, there was still no indication of any action. It is now heard that Gong Fangpei and others plan to resubmit their previous accusations and restate the facts, and Zhu Yakui and Cao Xinai, natives of the Third District of the county who are residing in Shanghai, will also jointly file charges to rectify their alma mater.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Southern Pudong Continues to be Subjected to Robbers. Jin Qiusheng, a farmer in the 15th Tu of Qian'gang, Tinglin, has a well-to-do family, and is coveted by bandits. He has been robbed twice. Unexpectedly, on the evening of March 24, seven or eight robbers broke into his home with knives, guns, and sharp weapons to search for valuables. The victim's son, Shouchun, chased after them closely and was shot dead. A neighboring plasterer was also injured in the arm and unable to work, leaving him unable to support his family. The victim praised his bravery and pitied his situation. In addition to subsidizing 200 yuan for medical expenses, he also gave him five mu of his own land to relieve his poverty. After the case, Huang Minyi, the director of the First Public Security Branch Bureau, urgently sought to solve the case and dispatched officers in all directions.</p>
<p>The night before, he led police to Yan Jiawan, Yangxupu, to arrest the ringleader Lu Yingcai and his accomplice Wen Ajin. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. It is said that Wen Ajin confessed to the robbery, but Lu Yingcai still wanted to quibble. After confrontation, the ringleader finally lowered his head and begged for his life. When the water police team stationed in Zhang heard about this, they telegraphed the branch bureau, saying that the ringleader Lu Yingcai had committed many crimes in Jin and was wanted. They hoped for a special investigation. Also, Wu Chengdu, the captain of the Second Branch of the County's Jingcha, arrested a robber named Jing Yaochun in Xihutang yesterday, who confessed to robbing the families of Wu Meiting and Xu Quantang.

The town's notorious local thug, Xue Jingqiu, also ordered teahouse owners Xu Xinggen and Ye Bingtai to assault the police officers. At this time, the town was in an uproar and the order was in chaos. The police officers had no choice but to return to the bureau injured and report to Chief Chen. After receiving the report, Chief Chen immediately prepared a document and reported it to the General Bureau, forwarding it to the county government for thorough investigation.</p>

It is expected that the truth of this case will be revealed after investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Levying an Additional Land Tax to Repay Arrears – The county's finances are extremely depleted, and a large amount of local expenses are owed.

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Murder Suspect Killed – Shang Xunmao, the squad leader of the Dengbu Mountain Defense Corps in Dinghai, shot and killed Liu Hede, Liu Rongan and other four people. The whole county of Dinghai was shocked. After the murderer committed the crime, he fled to Zhenhai. Wang Jifu, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Dinghai County, personally led police chief Qian Yunlong and police officer Wang Zhongqing to Zhenhai to track him down. Because they did not have official documents, they verbally requested assistance from the local authorities. Ren Fengbiao, a member of the Taohua Village Defense Corps in Dinghai, who lived in Zhenhai, heard that Chief Wang had come to Zhenhai to arrest the murderer. He immediately volunteered to assist. After Wang agreed, Ren took a handgun to search for Gao's whereabouts. At 5:00 a.m. yesterday, he saw Gao Xunmao slowly approaching in Chenjiabian, outside the West Gate. Ren went forward to make the arrest. Gao saw that the situation was not good and resisted with a handgun, firing two shots in a row. Fortunately, they missed. Ren also returned fire, firing four shots in a row, all of which hit the suspect's vital points. He fell to the ground. Ren Fengbiao reported to Chief Wang, who reported to the Zhenhai County Government for inspection.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Duck Herding in Rice Fields Leads to Murder Case – Wang Yongnian, a farmer from Shililiwang, outside the East Gate of Xiaoshan, was herding ducks in the rice fields, damaging the crops. On the 14th, his ducks were killed by his neighbor Lu Zhaoquan. The two sides had a conflict. That night, Wang gathered a group of people and went to the Lu family to cause trouble, injuring five members of the Lu family and killing two. One member of the Wang family was seriously injured and one was killed. The local police immediately reported to the local water police to suppress the situation. Because the area is located on the border of Shao and Xiao counties, it has now been reported to the Shao- county court for investigation.</p>
<p>Apprentice's Crimes Affect Boss – Qiu Wanzhen, an apprentice at the Yongkang Bank in Linpu, previously sent threatening letters to wealthy businessman Jin Yourong and wealthy gentleman Ge Xunzhang, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. The Linpu Public Security Bureau sent police to investigate. Qiu was captured when he was checking the mailbox in Hanqiaotou. Another person, Qiu Haiming, was also arrested. Ge Shiyou, the chief of the Fourth District, stated that because the bank's apprentice had committed such extortion crimes, it had greatly affected local security. He convened a district affairs meeting on the 10th, summoning the township leaders to discuss whether there was a reason why the bank had failed on its business operations and use of personnel. It is proposed to submit a request to the county to suspend its business, and that the bank should be responsible for this major case.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the National Institute for Compilation and Translation</h3>
<p>Internal staff have been appointed separately. After the Ministry of Education announced the organizational regulations of the National Institute for Compilation and Translation last month, the director, Xin Shu-, immediately began preparations. In terms of hiring specialized scholars, he held a meritocratic view, preferring to have vacancies than to lower the standards. He previously received 5,000 yuan from the Ministry of Railways and went to Shanghai once to purchase essential scientific basic book boxes and contacted various experts. However, due to limited funding, the current expenditure is less than half of the original budget (the original budget was 17,000 yuan, and the funds transferred from the Ministry of Education's Compilation and Review Department to the institute, combined with the funds from the Ministry of Railways, totaled approximately 7,000 yuan). Progress is difficult to achieve, so the experts contacted have not been able to be hired separately according to the original plan and will be gradually expanded in the future depending on the funding situation. Although the institute, reorganized and expanded from the Compilation and Review Department, has been preparing for many days, it does not seem to have been officially established. The various tasks of the original Compilation and Review Department continue as usual. However, the directors and editors hired according to the current financial situation were officially announced only yesterday. The institute is considered officially established. Because of the national crisis, no establishment ceremony will be held. When there is an opportunity in the future, people from all walks of life will be invited to the institute for guidance and to report on everything. The names of the directors and editors hired by the institute are recorded below: (1) In the field of natural sciences, Chen Kezhong is hired as the director, Zheng Zhenwen as the full-time editor (physics and chemistry), and Wang Gongmu (geology), Weng Zhilong (physiology and hygiene) as editors. Wang Shenghan (biology), Huang Shouzhong (mathematics), (1) In the field of social sciences, Tong Guanxian is hired as the director, Liu Yingshi (politics and economics) as the full-time editor, Xu Binghan (economics), Yan Yuanyou (international politics), and Wang Zengshan (Turkish history) as editors. (1) In other subjects, Zhou Qixun is hired as the full-time editor (English literature), Zhang Juelie and Li Weinong as editors (history, geography, and Japanese), Li Yiyan as the full-time editor (history), Zheng Hesheng as the full-time editor (also the director of the library), He Jianmin (Japanese) as the editor, Sun-Gong as the full-time editor (Chinese), Wang Zongshi as the editor, Zhou Bangdao as the full-time editor (education) (also the director of the primary and secondary school textbook review group), Deng Xiaoqin as the full-time editor (French), Zhuang Xianshi as the part-time editor (reviewing literature), and Hu Yanli and Ding Zhipin as editors (reviewing primary and secondary school textbooks, Ding Xiang writing).</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Postponement of High School Enrollment Dates</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed all senior high schools to postpone the enrollment test period, according to the Jiangxi Department of Education. The Department of Education issued an order to all provinces and cities yesterday saying that the Jiangxi Department of Education instructed that all schools should follow instructions. The Ministry deeply cared for the convenience of young people to enter schools and had been doing it flawlessly. Public and private high schools have held enrollment practices in early July in the past, which has caused the same inconvenience for junior high school graduates. The Ministry should approve the decision to issue an order to all public and private senior high schools in the country, so that they can postpone the enrollment test period uniformly with colleges and universities or above, to avoid the difficulty of junior high schools requiring early graduation. The instruction should be followed, and the high schools should take the content into reference when handling their affairs.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Celebrates Teacher's Day</h3>
<p>The Nanchang Education Sector held a Teacher's Day celebration meeting at 1:00 p.m. on June 6 at the No. 1 Middle School Yiyuan in Yonghemen. Those who attended the meeting included Zhou Shengming, the representative of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters; Ye Jihuai, the representative of the Provincial Rectification Committee; Li Xicheng, the representative of the Provincial Government; Liu Fangguo, the representative of the Department of Education; and a total of more than 800 people from the education sector. Xie Zhaoxiong and others were elected as the presidium. The chairman led the meeting as usual and reported on the significance of the meeting, roughly saying that Teacher's Day was initiated by the education sectors in Beijing and Shanghai, and it was still an innovation in our province. Then, the guests Liu Fangguo and others gave speeches one after another. All members passed six proposals: (1) Request the Department of Education to forward a request to the Ministry of Education to determine June 6 as Teacher's Day. (2) Request the Department of Education to guarantee teachers' lives and improve teachers' salaries. (3) Request the Department of Education to reduce teaching time to increase teaching efficiency. (4) Request the government to increase education funds to ensure its independence. (5) Request the government to find ways to help poor and out-of-school youth. (6) Request the military and political authorities to order all troops not to be stationed in educational institutions. At the end, there was a solo of elegant music by Wang Juxiang, a female middle school teacher, and a piano solo by Liu Zuxin. Then, they shouted slogans, took photos, and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3>Supervisor of Jiangsu Province Visits Cheng to Inspect</h3>
<p>And must reorganize all education funds. The Department of Education of Jiangsu Province, due to the education conflicts and financial difficulties in various counties, stipulated that in order to reorganize the education plans of the counties and seek thorough reorganization, it specially designated several counties to be organized into a reorganization team jointly by all provincial supervisors to go to reorganize. First, study the root cause of the conflicts, the reason for the educational difficulties, and then start to reorganize. Because Jiangdu is a county with educational disputes, Director Zhou first sent five provincial supervisors, including Zhou Yuxin, to the county to reorganize and concentrate their efforts. The reorganization was completed in two months. Jiangyin education fees have been in arrears for six months, making it difficult to run schools. Other counties, such as Yixing, Jiangning, Rugao, and Taixing, have education fees in arrears for more than eight or nine months and should be reorganized immediately. The reorganization is divided into periods, depending on the urgency of each county. However, at most two counties will be reorganized each semester. Those reorganized in the third and fourth periods will have to wait one or two years. Before the reorganization, there will be an inspection to determine whether the county needs to be reorganized in advance, and then the Department of Education will decide. Supervisor Zhou Zhongxin is responsible for the school district along the Yangtze River, up to Baoshan. Because Jiangyin is Zhou's hometown, he came to Wujin via Nanzhong School on the 12th. On the 13th, he went to the Education Bureau to investigate the education fee budget, and then went to various primary and secondary schools in the urban area to set a date for the 16th to return to the province to attend the Department Affairs Meeting to report on the end of the reorganization of Jiangdu education and the inspection of Jiangyin. If Jiangyin needs to be reorganized in advance, all the supervisors will come to Cheng to reorganize in the future to calculate the education fee situation.</p>

<p>Coming back from Wansongling, I let Mr. Zhu's words float around in my head for a while. Mr. Zhu was confident. I want to build a small shadow of an active school from many broken concepts. The ancient temple school must be a living school in which there is the latent of life, the freedom of life, and the struggle of life. After considering it again and again, I drew the following sketch of the ancient temple school we were going to run:</p>
<p>"Quiet as seeds underground. Free as pigeons in the sky. Fierce as fighting tigers and lions." I wrote it down, took it to Mr. Zhu, and asked him to instruct me. He was very happy and immediately picked up a pen and said, "I will write a few words too":</p>

<p>A noble life is entrusted to strict physical training. Ms. Helen Madison's success as a world swimming champion is entirely due to her determined struggle. She is only an eighteen-year-old young girl this year.</p>
<h3>The World Was Startled</h3>
<p>This young Madison girl from Seattle, Washington, USA, has only recently practiced water sports and entered the world of sports. Sure enough, her name, her talented swimming skills, have attracted the attention of the world swimming community. Many famous swimming pools in the United States and Canada have been splashed by the Madison girl's footsteps and water splashes, and have created many new world records. This summer, the audience at the World Olympics in Los Angeles will be able to see the one and only Madison girl who has created many world records. Her eyes are truly a blessing, especially since this is her last time participating in the competition in her life.</p>
<h3>The World's First Extraordinary Woman</h3>
<p>No champion in the world has reached the honor of this Washington girl. She is the first extraordinary woman in history. No place, no athlete, no sport has created as many world records as she has. She has already created sixteen world records in women's freestyle swimming. Twelve have been officially recognized, and the remaining four are newly created and will soon be officially held by her. She will end her achievements and display them in the world of competition. It is indeed a great and glorious memory.</p>

<h3>一二八後的上海敎育事業（十六尚）</h3>
<p>The world's undertakings naturally mostly shift with the economy. The revival of undertakings undoubtedly relies on the economy as the center. With the vastness of China and the size of Shanghai, how can the revival of the Songhu education be impossible because of poverty? I really don't believe it, and I'm afraid everyone else won't believe it either. Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education, said when he arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday that he plans to issue "Cultural Bonds" to restore the Shanghai education, using the British Boxer Indemnity as a fund, and actively promote sales by the disaster-stricken schools, using the cultural fund to restore cultural undertakings, which can be called a good method. This concerns the central government. On the Shanghai municipal government side, I personally feel that there are several things that can be implemented: one is to collect entertainment donations, and the second is that the more than 80,000 yuan of educational funds that were reduced starting in February should still be supplemented and allocated for the purpose of reviving education, and the third is to raise debts. The third matter should be carried out when it is unavoidable. School organizers and the public should do their best to promote cultural bonds. The alumni associations of each school can raise donations at home and abroad. The Public Works Bureau will subsidize the schools within the concession with 70,000 taels per year, and the subsidized schools can generously donate to the disaster-stricken private schools to provide assistance and express sympathy. The private sector may as well negotiate on its own, formulate regulations, and distribute them fairly. Private individuals with family property, especially residents in war zones, donating a portion of their wealth to promote education is also feasible. Let's all hurry up and proceed. My humble opinion is nothing more than the occasional gain of a woodcutter. I still hope that the broad-minded people at home and abroad will correct and promote it. Finally, I have to say a few unpleasant words, but I can't help but say them, that is, there should be no centrifugal force between the government and the government, between the people and the people, and between the government and the people, to avoid the evils of "divided forces, scattered affections, and a short rope for a deep well." This is not unfounded worry, it is the worry that the national character often shows and gives us. Everyone should ask themselves, in the areas occupied by the enemy, can you come and go freely? Can you teach your children to love the country? Can you hang white flags? Human nature is such that the harder it is to obtain something, the more eager one is to obtain it. Once one is fortunate enough to obtain it, then the deeper one's love for it will be. Don't you see that Koreans have to go to jail for thirty days for reading their own Korean history, and they are arrested for self-compiled lecture notes? Children are not allowed to read "The story of an elephant refusing a second master," and making songs with Korean characters will result in two years in prison. Female students who are unwilling to worship the Emperor will be prisoners for seven years. It is not allowed to mention Julius Caesar of Rome, and there must be no "devil" (the Japanese refer to this term as scolding the Japanese) tone or words. Specialized schools have their liberal arts departments abolished, and associations for the union of two or more schools and school research are all prohibited. Koreans cannot be principals of Korean schools, and children have only three years of education opportunities after they turn eight. People who have books to read and books to teach, who have not reached the point of abandoning their own goals and pursuing the goals of others, should wake up quickly! If you don't cultivate your own fields, others will come to cultivate them. Expanding the concession and implementing free markets, others are waiting for the opportunity to come. Alas, the people of Korea would rather sacrifice the lives of millions after the country is lost than sacrifice the opinions of a few before the country is lost. Thinking about it now, what is the use? "Oh, don't ask whether they want Korea, but first examine how I wish Korea. Then Korea is indeed my precious bell. Furthermore, observe what they do to Korea, and what they do to the Korean people. Then today's Korea is especially today's mirror of me." These are the opening words of Mr. Ren Zhi in his book on Korea. The reporter will borrow the last paragraph as the ending of this article. (End)</p>
<p>Correction: In the second paragraph of this article, in the list of schools with all assets destroyed, Wusong Merchant Marine School should be included in the higher education institutions. This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>The method of organizing the event is inevitably extensive but not refined. Although it costs millions of yuan (including all provinces and counties, the central government only allocated 800,000 yuan), and brought more than 3,000 large boxes to participate in the exhibition, the results are still mixed. I believe that although the items collected for this participation in the Chicago World's Fair are limited due to the limited progress in the past century, we should at least strictly select and carefully explain to show that our country has embarked on the path of science and intends to hold a preliminary competition in Shanghai. After everyone has seen it and thinks it is acceptable, then it will be shipped overseas. (3) Implement the participation period. This is the purpose of the National Government's participation in foreign expositions. What does it mean to implement participation? Because the exposition is a huge advertising arena and also a huge competition arena. The so-called participation is not only carrying some items for temporary display and getting some awards and certificates. All domestic products, if they are already sold overseas, can take this opportunity to expand sales. If they are not yet able to sell a lot, they will also use this to advertise. Even if we know that we are lagging behind and cannot compete with others, comparing and learning from others' strengths and making up for our own weaknesses is also a way to seek progress. Brazilian coffee was not sold in Europe before. In 1911, it advertised heavily at the Turin Exposition in Italy. Every tourist was invited to drink a cup and given a package. As a result, many were sold on the spot, and most Europeans have since formed an indissoluble bond with Brazilian coffee. This is the best example. Also, my country's porcelain won praise at the 1905 Brussels Exposition. A Belgian businessman wanted to sign a contract with the Chinese who was guarding the porcelain to order 50,000 francs of porcelain. Unexpectedly, that Chinese was a temporary staff member hired by the embassy from who knows where. The porcelain he was guarding was collected from various shops by the country, province, county, and so on. He didn't know the source or the price. As a result, he couldn't answer. At that time, the Japanese pavilion was right next to the Chinese pavilion. The Japanese businessman got the news and rushed to solicit business and was robbed of the business. Not only was this business robbed by him, but also the endless business in the future, I am afraid it has nothing to do with me, wouldn't it be a great pity? Therefore, participation in foreign expositions must be automatic by merchants and the people to be the right way. The government is only in the position of guidance and introduction. The government pavilion and the temporary consulates should be hosted by the government. As for the various specialized pavilions and sub-pavilions, if they are also participated in by the government, no matter how effective the agency is, it will inevitably be scratching the surface. This time participating in the Chicago World's Fair, a part of the extremely small funds is allocated to subsidize the representatives of the silk, tea, porcelain, and carpet industries. This is the intention. I also hope that other industries with stronger strength will prepare their own funds and send representatives to join the grand event. In short, this Chicago World's Fair is no different from a scientific exam. Since our country has decided to observe the venue, we must prepare well. Since we have suffered national disasters, it is the time for the world to pay attention. Chinese and Japanese products are mostly the same, and they are displayed side by side, and the advantages and disadvantages are easy to see. In order to maintain the dignity of the country and to show personal ability, we have to take out the courage of "everything depends on human effort", prepare as much as possible, and publicize as much as possible, so that the people of the country can understand the success or failure of the competition. The government should take more responsibility, and the people of the country should also shoulder the heavy burden. On the one hand, the colleagues of this association will study carefully to show that China has embarked on the path of science. On the other hand, the colleagues of various industries should send more representatives to open up the way for future participation. Officials and people cooperate and go to one place to achieve the greatest effect with the least cost. This is what Gongbo dare not but encourage himself, and also hope for your guidance and assistance. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank you for participating in the preparations and wish you all success.</p>
<h3>張司長報告</h3>
<p>Director Zhang Yichou of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry reported that the United States is scheduled to hold a Centennial Progress Memorial Exposition in Chicago in 1933. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce in February of the 19th year, that is, approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' letter to the US Envoy to China James, stating "Ordered to invite our government to participate, and attached the Congressional resolution, the President's declaration, etc., please review and reply." At that time, the military was rising, and the reply was delayed for a long time. It was not until March of last year that the Ministry submitted it to the Executive Yuan for the 16th State Council meeting, which resolved, "Should participate", and the Ministry consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform. All the government's decision to participate and the intention of the US gathering, and the situation since the establishment of this committee, the Minister has reported in detail, and Yichou will not repeat it. However, regarding the budget item, although the budget was established after the decision to participate, the plan was far before the decision to participate. Among them, the difficult situation has to be supplemented with a few words for you. When the Commercial Department followed the order to compile the budget, it was found that the national treasury's expenditure for participating in the Panama Games in the 4th year of the Republic was more than 700,000 Chinese currency, and the expenses of various provinces and counties were not included. At that time, one Chinese currency was exchanged for about seven or eight cents of US dollars, which is very different compared with now. At the same time, Minister Wu in the United States also presented and transferred from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advocating that the cost of participating in the Chicago Fair should be set at one million US dollars. The Department of Commerce considered the advantages and disadvantages and invited the heads of the foreign and financial departments to consult, and then there was a proposal to set it at one million national currency. Later, due to the depletion of the national treasury, it was changed to 700,000 yuan, and then changed to 400,000 yuan. This is the number approved by the Executive Yuan and transferred to the Directorate-General of Budget in July of last year. These 400,000 yuan are divided into budgets for the 20th and 21st years. The funds that should be received in the 20th year were originally divided into four phases. The Executive Yuan repeatedly instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate them according to the plan. However, due to the difficult situation at that time, the Ministry of Finance only recently agreed to allocate them according to the plan. This is the general situation of the establishment of the participation budget. In addition, there are several matters that should be noted immediately. (1) The issue of funding. The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan previously approved a letter from Mr. Lin Baike, a consultant to the National Government, which stated, "If China feels that there is insufficient funding to participate in the Chicago Exposition, it can raise donations from Chinese overseas in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Canada, etc." It was ordered to be handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Trade Committee, and the Ministry of Finance for joint review and record. It was found that the government's participation funding has been repeatedly reduced due to financial difficulties. It seems that it can only be used sparingly according to income. Overseas Chinese compatriots have also been in difficult circumstances recently. Whether it is possible to solicit donations from them and what method to use for soliciting donations should be carefully considered. This should be noted first. (2) The issue of soliciting items. It was found that the nature of the Chicago Exposition focuses on showing the progress of science and cultural undertakings in the past 100 years. In addition to the products of industry, agriculture, and various industries, it pays special attention to scientific inventions and evolution, as well as the great achievements of art, drama, sports, and celebrities from all walks of life. When our country collects items to participate in the competition, it should collect as much as possible based on this purpose. However, after reviewing the previous collection methods, they were mostly carried out from a horizontal perspective. The most serious one was the participation in the Panama Fair. The central government set up a preparatory office, the provinces set up product associations, and the counties set up product sub-associations. The organization seemed very fast, but the selection and sorting were not scientific, and the quantity was large and the quality was not refined. This time participating in the Chicago Fair, in addition to the special products of each province and city, which may still be collected by the competent departments of each province and city, it seems that the main products should be classified and changed from a vertical perspective to jointly engage with relevant agencies, schools, and academic and industrial groups. Divide and cooperate. For example, those related to cultural education are entrusted to the Ministry of Education, the Academia Sinica, and national universities and schools. Those related to art are entrusted to the National Academy of Art. Those related to agriculture and industry are entrusted to the Ministry of Industry's Forestry Department, Agriculture Department, Agricultural Experiment Institute, Central Industrial Experiment Institute, Chinese Agricultural Society, Industrial Federation, and agricultural and industrial colleges of various universities. Other dramas and sports are handled in the same way. With the responsibility of the expert, the products obtained will be orderly and considerable. This should be noted second. (3) The issue of holding preliminary competitions in the country for the items collected. After the products have been carefully selected by experts, they should still be exhibited in Shanghai in advance for the majority of the people of the country to study and criticize together. We must wait until everyone thinks it is acceptable before shipping them overseas. When should the preliminary competition be held? How much will the preliminary competition cost? Can all of it be allocated from the original 400,000 yuan, or do we need to find other ways? All of these must be decided as early as possible. This should be noted third. (4) The issue of the government pavilion building. According to the telegram from Consul General Ye in Chicago, the site for our country's government pavilion building has been surveyed and determined on the right side of the main venue gate, in the international special area, near the water and facing south, covering an area of one acre, which is about six acres in China, and the contract has been formally signed. The shape of the terrain is an unequal edge, with a calculated edge of 320 feet, 250 feet northeast, 100 feet east, 75 feet southeast, and 125 feet south. The surrounding roads and slopes face the lake. Since the site has been surveyed, we should start designing, drawing, and constructing immediately. The style should imitate the ancient system (US Conference Director Siweilu and National Government Consultant Lin Baike have both sent letters advocating this, and the specialized pavilions built by our country in previous expositions in various countries are also mostly like this). The nature of the building should be temporary, in order to be beautiful. There is no doubt about it. However, whether to hire one or two architects or specially contract a construction company to be fully responsible for the matter, or to offer a reward to solicit designs within a limited time for selection, should be considered and decided as early as possible. Also, after the pavilion's frame and corridors have been roughly determined, how should the surrounding ground be decorated with flowers and trees? It is especially important to inform the Consul in advance so that they can be planted in the fall and winter of this year. This should be noted fourth. The above sections are what the Ministry has done or discussed since the official establishment of the Preparatory Committee, but the Minister has no time to elaborate. In addition, there is a large part of the informal preparatory work that is being carried out in Shanghai. The two directors He and Cai are actually in charge of it, or there is another report. Yichou's words stop here to avoid wasting more time.</p>
<h3>租界電話工潮談判不幸决裂</h3>
<p>Negotiations in the Concession Telephone Workers' Strike Unsuccessfully Break Down</p>
<p>The Strike Committee Issues an Urgent Notice</p>
<p>People Seeking to Restore the Labor Union are Beaten</p>
<p>After the telephone workers in the concession went on strike, the Strike Committee sent representatives to negotiate with the company again yesterday afternoon regarding the protest letter demanding a response from the company within 24 hours, but there was still no result, leading to a breakdown. The details of the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Negotiations Break Down The Strike Committee submitted a protest letter to the company at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, demanding a response within 24 hours. By 2 p.m. yesterday, the deadline had expired, but the company still had no response. The Strike Committee then sent representatives Chen Yaozu, Xu Shize, Ye Yilong, and others to Xinzhengyang Building on Fujian Road at 3 p.m. to negotiate. They were received by engineer Wilson, who claimed that the protest letter submitted by the workers had not yet been translated, so he could not respond. However, he expressed his refusal to the basic conditions proposed by the workers.</p>
<p>Urgent Notice The Strike Committee issued an urgent notice yesterday morning as follows: (1) Employees of all lines and departments must convene a general meeting of all employees this morning to criticize the shortcomings of the past presidium's work and urge the presidium to step up its work and pay serious attention to bad elements. (2) Representatives should be selected from the general meeting of all lines and departments to participate in the work of the Strike Committee. (3) The presidium is scheduled to hold a general meeting of all representatives at 4 p.m. today. The location will be notified temporarily. Formal representatives should be selected in advance and gather at the Tongshang Hotel at 3:30 p.m. Another notice was issued that night, deciding to change the representative meeting to 10 a.m. on the 16th.</p>
<p>Violent Beating of Reactionaries Workers Tang Liangzhi, Weng Zhenhua, Chen Zerong, and the No. 41 foreman secretly negotiated with the company the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they secretly held a meeting in rooms 509 and 513 of the Far East Hotel and discussed restoring the old labor union. The striking workers were very angry. At about 5 p.m., they beat Tang Liangzhi and others behind the Great World. It is reported that Tang and others had their clothes torn to pieces and were injured and admitted to the hospital. It is reported that the striking workers will take more severe measures to deal with them in the future.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Strike Committee A member of the Strike Committee told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday that the company has always had no sincerity in accepting negotiations on the basic conditions proposed by the workers. All striking workers have requested that the picket team be ordered to destroy the automatic telephone work, but the Strike Committee, for the convenience of the public, has decided not to lead the workers to carry out destructive work. Now the company has refused to respond to the workers' protest letter. If it provokes public anger and an unfortunate incident occurs, the company should bear full responsibility. Warning to Foremen The Strike Committee warned the foremen yesterday against undermining the labor movement and specifically warned them to immediately implement the following three things: (1) Dissolve the secret organization. (2) Absolutely obey the command and orders of the Strike Committee. (3) Stop all secret negotiations with capitalists and officials, and stop all rumors and other destructive actions.</p>
<p>Aid and Fundraising The Shanghai People's Anti-Armistice Agreement and the Northeast Volunteer Army Joint Association issued a second declaration for aiding the telephone workers' strike, and issued fundraising remarks, saying that the Northeast Volunteer Army is advancing one after another and fighting in an extremely difficult environment. They want to resist Japanese imperialism, overthrow Japanese imperialism, and recover China's lost territories. The Shanghai Telephone Company workers' strike is also a heroic struggle against imperialism and for the liberation of the Chinese nation. It is equally of great significance and is a glorious action. Now all imperialist attempts to jointly divide China are being exposed step by step in the "September 18th" Incident, the Round Table Conference, the establishment of Shanghai as a free city, and the joint management of the Northeast. The Chinese people, if they want to avoid being slaves of imperialism, must unite themselves, stand on a single front, and carry out arduous struggles with the strength of the entire nation. We cannot stand idly by for all anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist movements. The Northeast Volunteer Army and the Shanghai Telephone striking workers need the material supply of our people's strength to strengthen their fighting power and achieve final victory. Therefore, this association has specially organized a fundraising team to raise donations from all sectors of the public to help them. It is hoped that all compatriots will be aware of the tragic disaster of national subjugation, think of the hard work of the soldiers on the front line, and do their best to donate generously. Then it will not only be the fortune of the Northeast Volunteer Army and the Shanghai Telephone workers, but also a glimmer of hope for the future of the entire Chinese nation. This is a notice.</p>
<h3>法商水電工人要求有解决希望</h3>
<p>French Merchant Water and Electricity Workers' Demands Have Hope of Resolution</p>
<p>The company's manager has sincerely accepted the Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union's delegation of representatives to negotiate with the French Merchant Water and Electricity Company. The manager has sincerely accepted it, but it still needs to go through procedures before it can be implemented. All workers believe that they are satisfied.</p>
<h3>陳紹寛昨來滬</h3>
<p>Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the China East News Agency specially interviewed him at the shipyard to inquire about various matters. According to Chen,</p>
<p>The January 28th Incident When the January 28th War broke out, the navy's response was extremely difficult. Because it involved national honor, military secrets, and other various matters, it was impossible to announce the details clearly, which caused public opinion to be in an uproar and misunderstandings about our army. I will not argue about this. In addition, there were one or two bad elements who took the opportunity to slander our army. In fact, they had political backgrounds and intended to eliminate our army. The ignorant public was temporarily confused by them and echoed their accusations. It must be known that in a country with the spirit of the rule of law, we soldiers should absolutely obey the government's orders to comply with the laws and regulations. The actions of our army are only based on the orders of the central government. Although the material aspects and economic aspects of our army are not as good as others, we dare not refuse the government's orders, even if we go through fire and water. When the 19th Route Army borrowed anti-aircraft guns and steel plates from our army, because very few ships were equipped with anti-aircraft guns, and the majority of ships were not equipped with anti-aircraft guns, all the newly purchased steel plates are still stored in the customs warehouse today. Because there is no money to withdraw them, we still have to pay thousands of taels of warehouse rent every month. However, the outside world is attacking these two things, but the facts are all there, so it is difficult to erase them.</p>
<p>This Year's Construction Mr. Chen also said that the central government has now decided to change two-thirds of the navy's expansion funds for this year to expand the air force. The Legislative Yuan has also passed it. Looking at the world situation, members of the US and British parliaments are urging the government to expand the navy as a matter of urgency, but our country is doing the opposite. Therefore, it will be difficult for the navy to have any construction this year.</p>
<p>Persuade Chen Weilong to Stay As for Chen Jiliang, the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of this Ministry and Commander of the First Fleet, who telegraphed to resign, I have already telegraphed back to persuade him to stay. However, the reason for his resignation is nothing more than being subjected to unconscious attacks from the outside world.</p>
<p>Ninghai Ship Arrives in Shanghai The Ninghai warship built in Japan has been completed. There are still outstanding expenses for the second, third, fourth, and fifth months that should be paid every month, so it is still stranded in the Three Islands. We are now trying our best to find a way to pay off the money so that it can be driven to Shanghai as soon as possible. As for the Pinghai and Jiangninghai warships built at the Jiangnan Shipyard before, it is difficult to determine the completion date due to limited funds. Commendation for the Guard Battalion After the outbreak of this war, all the defense of Gaoyang Temple in southern Shanghai, in addition to the Public Security Bureau and the arsenal, was also assisted by the Navy Guard Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi, who supervised the soldiers to maintain law and order day and night, so that the territory could be peaceful. Chen specially commended Battalion Commander Ye of the battalion yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Opposition to Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>Rejection of Poison Association: A spokesperson for the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association gave a speech yesterday, stating, "Rumors of an opium monopoly have surfaced more than once, and the authorities have denied them each time. However, the result has always been that the opium monopoly is implemented and then canceled due to public opposition. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the opium monopoly has been trialed three times. The most obvious example is last year's Office for the Prohibition of Opium and Investigation of Smuggling. What were its achievements? What was the extent of its 'benefit to the country and the people'? We can easily recall that last year's Office for the Prohibition of Opium and Investigation of Smuggling emulated the special tax on the two Hubei and Hunan provinces in Wuhan and the opium monopoly system in Taiwan. The special tax on the two Hubei and Hunan provinces harmed the country and the people. Not only did the people oppose it, but most people in the government also expressed opposition. Its content needs no further description. As for Taiwan's opium monopoly system, it was a poisonous scheme by Japanese imperialism to massacre Chinese people in the occupied territory and extract money, which has been criticized by world opinion. How can an independent country have the heart to imitate it and implement it on its own compatriots? The founder of Taiwan's opium monopoly was Japanese hygienist Shinpei Goto. The most important point of his argument was to sell opium to the Taiwanese people to make them gradually weaken and perish, and to use the income to fund Japanese hygiene projects (for details, please refer to the book "A Glimpse of Taiwan's Opium Prohibition" written by Huang Jia-hui, the executive director of this association). The promoter of China's opium monopoly is Wu Liande. Wu and Goto are both hygienists. Wu's plan to advocate the monopoly also uses a portion of the monopoly income to run hygiene projects, which is roughly the same as Goto's plan. Whether it is copied or a case of 'great minds think alike' is difficult to say. However, the fundamental difference is that the opium monopoly harms the people of the occupied territory on one hand and harms the compatriots of its own country on the other. However, when Wu was arrested by the Japanese in Guanwai, he admitted that he was British and no longer Chinese. Therefore, China is not his motherland, and the Chinese are not his compatriots. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Wu's advocacy of the opium monopoly stems from the same motive as Goto's, both of which are intended to inflict harm on the innocent people of foreign countries. What is there to care about? In short, such theories have hundreds of disadvantages and no advantages. Even a three-foot-tall child knows that it is not feasible. No one in the world has ever thought it feasible. As for now, China's financial difficulties are self-evident. However, in recent years, European countries such as Germany and Austria have had far greater financial difficulties than China. All levels of government have been united and have tried their best to economize to overcome the difficulties. There has never been any public sale. If the opium monopoly policy of national destruction and extermination is implemented due to financial difficulties, it will inevitably be condemned by the whole country and a sinner for all ages. I believe that today's ruling officials will not rashly adopt it. However, Liu Ruiheng, chairman of the Opium Prohibition Committee, recently submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, opposing the complete ban and advocating a gradual ban, as well as collecting tobacco taxes to manage the prohibition of opium. What is the difference between these measures and a disguised monopoly? These remarks come from the mouth of the responsible chief of opium prohibition, and we cannot regard them as trivial. Entrusted by the people and shouldering the important responsibility of rejecting poison, the Association's opposition to public sales completely stands on the late Premier's teachings on rejecting poison and the unanimous demands of the people. It has neither political color nor the slightest desire. The only purpose is to ensure that the government is determined to ban opium. It is hoped that comrades across the country will work together to achieve this goal to save the country from danger. I am very fortunate."</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation: The Overseas Chinese Federation sent a letter to the Executive Yuan yesterday, saying, "To Director Wang of the Executive Yuan of the National Government: We have recently heard that the central government will implement an opium monopoly to increase revenue due to financial exhaustion and implement the plans that have been planned but not implemented in the past two years. We are shocked to hear this. The opium monopoly is a public enemy of the national will. It has been repeatedly implemented and repeatedly failed. The facts are obvious. The government authorities will never dare to take it decisively. However, the rumors from all parties are well-founded and definitely not comparable to rumors. Has the National Government's opium prohibition policy changed? We hope to make it thoroughly clear. If the public sale or similar disguised public sale is still adopted, the Association will unite with the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association and various countries to resist it to the death."</p>
<p>Lawyers Association: The National Lawyers Association sent a telegram saying, "To the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, the National Anti-Opium Organizations, and the Newspapers: There are special provisions in the law to prohibit opium and eliminate drugs, which are the main guidelines of the Party. In recent years, the central opium prohibition authorities have not implemented them effectively. Army and navy personnel have forced the planting of tobacco and sheltered private transportation, which is commonplace. The government has not punished or stopped them, resulting in the implementation of public sales in various provinces in the north and south. The authorities have not taken measures to ban and eliminate the laws and have lost their dignity. The people of the country are extremely saddened. Recently, there have been rumors that the central government will adopt public sales due to lack of military expenses. The cities of Shanghai, both north and south, are planning to start it first. There must be a reason for this. Alas, the blood of the soldiers in the Battle of Shanghai has not yet dried, and the sound of guns and cannons in the Northeast has not stopped. The country is facing its doom and is about to perish. How can the whole country work together to become strong and resist the violent enemy? They are eager to make plans for drinking poison and adopting a strategy to reduce the cultivation of tobacco. It is really sad. We hope that all comrades who reject poison will make up their minds and fight to the end so that Wu Liande's evil theory of opium monopoly will not be realized, and Liu Ruiheng's poisonous plan to prohibit opium in the levy will not be implemented, to protect the dignity of the prohibition law and achieve the purpose of complete elimination. The country is fortunate, the nation is fortunate. Sincerely, the Propaganda Department of the National Lawyers Association, deleted."</p>
<h3>Most Houses on the North Bank of Suzhou Creek Are Exempt from Rent for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the 32nd District Branch of the Municipal Federation: The 32nd District Branch of the Citizens' Federation held a newspaper committee meeting yesterday, attended by more than ten people. Cheng Xiechun was publicly elected as chairman. After reporting on the incoming and outgoing documents, the meeting discussed the proposals: (1) Members of the Alabaster Road Changshou Lane Jin Hongyuan and others sent letters requesting the implementation of rent exemption for three months. After mediation by the Federation, the landlord Zhou Qilian agreed to exempt rent for three months in accordance with the general principle. (2) The landlord Qiahe Company of Qiaxing Lane issued a notice in the newspaper, voluntarily exempting rent for two months, while the tenants requested the implementation of rent exemption for three months. After mediation by the Federation and with the understanding of the Qiahe Company, rent exemption for three months was approved. (3) All tenants of Fu'an Lane and Shunxing Garden Bathhouse sent letters requesting the Siming Bank, the landlord, to consider the survivors after the disaster and grant rent exemption for three months. After Cheng Xiechun, a standing committee member of the Federation, took the initiative to mediate, the Siming Bank agreed to exempt rent for three months. (4) Shen Chang and other stores on Kaifeng Road and the tenants of Yu'an Lane jointly sent letters stating that the landlord Yang Foji entrusted lawyer Gu Hanli to send letters demanding rent for February, March, April, and May and to take back the houses for their own use, which was like oppression, and requested fair assistance. It was decided to send letters to Yang Foji and lawyer Gu Hanli, requesting them to act in accordance with the general principle and exempt rent for three months for houses adjacent to the war zone. For the rent in May, please send someone to collect it. (5) Members of Yongda North Wansheng and others sent letters stating that the landlord Yiji Company entrusted lawyer Huang Yuping to demand rent, but the small stores had never owed rent. The rent for January was collected on April 28, and the rent was returned and the rent receipt was taken back the next day, which clearly showed that the landlord was oppressing them, and requested fair assistance. It was decided to send letters to the landlord and lawyer Huang Yuping, requesting them to act in accordance with the general principle and exempt rent for February, March, and April for three months. For January and May, please send someone to collect it, and do not act too hastily to avoid disputes and hurt feelings. Finally, other matters were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Sakano Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Rear Admiral Sakano, commander of the First Foreign Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to take office. Yesterday morning at 10:45, he led Major Hou, a staff officer, and Kuwahara, a military attaché of the Japanese Consulate, to the Municipal Government to visit the mayor. Mayor Wu met them as usual, and Yin Rugeng, a counselor of the Municipal Government, acted as interpreter. The two sides talked for about 15 minutes, and the Japanese commander left. Mayor Wu has scheduled to pay a return visit within a few days as usual.</p>
<h3>Lin Wo Will Talk About the National Aviation Salvation Association</h3>
<p>A reporter from Huadong News Agency interviewed Mr. Lin Wo, who was dispatched by the Aviation Administration to Shanghai to discuss the National Aviation Salvation Association. According to him, since the Battle of Shanghai, overseas Chinese groups, domestic Party branches, and other local groups have repeatedly requested the government to immediately start expanding the air force and requested the establishment of the National Aviation Salvation Association so that the people can assist the government and work together to realize Premier Sun's policy of saving the country through aviation in the near future. Among them, there are various proposals for the central government to implement. In the past two months, the Executive Yuan has received many such enthusiastic requests one after another and has successively sent them to the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the Aviation Administration to summarize the opinions of all parties and formulate measures to ensure that such civil society groups and government-coordinated aviation salvation agencies can be realized as soon as possible. This is the origin of the Aviation Administration's dispatching me to Shanghai to first seek opinions from leaders from all parties and explain the government's willingness to sincerely work with all parties to rectify aviation. After arriving in Shanghai, I have visited Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, and other leaders in Shanghai for several days. All parties hope that this plan for official-civilian cooperation can be realized as soon as possible. As for specific measures, it is still necessary to wait for the election of directors of the association, who will then organize the general association, formulate regulations, and submit them to the National Government for approval. This kind of organization focuses on the automatic efforts of civil society groups and is not created by the government. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the government to formulate specific measures first. Regarding the issue of directors, as far as I know, 70% to 80% of them are people with high prestige in the social and economic circles, and 20% to 30% are leaders or experts in the military, political, and aviation circles, all of whom are hired by the National Government. In the future, branches will also be established in various provinces and important cities. In short, the organization of the National Aviation Salvation Association is a new understanding of the aviation industry by the government and the public after the devastation and trauma caused by the violent Japanese. If all parties can take advantage of this strong public sentiment and the lingering pain, they will be able to catch up and achieve great results in the shortest possible time. It is easier to start organizing the air force and training aviation personnel. After this, there are several points that China should pay attention to regarding aviation national defense issues: (1) training aviation personnel; (2) adding various military aircraft and enriching the organization of the air force; (3) expanding aviation manufacturing plants; (4) air defense weapons, such as anti-aircraft guns. The above are all things that need to be paid attention to in rectifying the aviation industry and need to be coordinated by the people and the government. Various issues regarding military aviation and air defense equipment are now limited by time and cannot be discussed in detail. I will talk about them another day. According to reports, Mr. Lin is from Fujian and is currently a specialist member of the Aviation Legal System of the Ministry of Military Affairs. He returned from the United States last year.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the Patriotic Fallen Veterans' Relatives Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Patriotic Fallen Veterans' Relatives Relief Association held its tenth standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm. Committee members Zhu Qinglan, Yu Qiaqing, Bai Wenwei, Xu Shiying, and others attended. Xu Shiying chaired the meeting and reported on the following matters: (A) Mr. Situ Bo donated 100 yuan to the association's fund. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) The proposal to publish advertisements to solicit funds. It was found that soliciting donations through newspaper advertisements resulted in larger collections.

There are two points that need to be decided publicly: (a) The advertising fee is very large and is planned to be paid from the operating expenses. (b) Is it appropriate for the advertisements to be kept by the standing committee members and the committee members listed? Please decide whether to implement it. It was decided to proceed as planned. (2) The proposal to convene regular executive and supervisory committee meetings. It was decided to hold it at 4:00 pm on the 25th. (3) The proposal to send letters to the governments of various provinces and cities. It was decided to proceed as planned.</p>

<h3>Five Million Bags of Siamese Rice Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>More than two million bags have already arrived. Shanghai rice merchants have ordered a large number of foreign rice from Siam this year to supply food to the people. They only started to ship them one after another after the end of the Battle of Shanghai. The shipping companies in Shanghai that carry the Siamese rice include Lai Chi, Taikoo, Nippon Yusen Kaisha Yamashita, and other ships. It has been found that only Lai Chi has loaded and carried 16 ships, totaling 100,000 tons, totaling one million bags. The other foreign ships have also carried more than 100,000 tons. 68,000 bags arrived yesterday and are being unloaded at He Feng Dock. There are still three million bags in the process of being loaded and will be loaded within this month.</p>
<h3>Collision of Shanghai Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Ningjing Damaged Cas</p>
<p>Workers Dispatched for Repairs on the Same Day</p>
<p>The Ningjing ship of the Ningshao Company in Shanghai came from the Yangtze River to Shanghai. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 am, the ship arrived in front of the company's dock in Nanshi and was about to turn around to dock. At this time, the new Norwegian ship Cas, owned by the British firm Lai Chi, was anchored on the river channel at that location. When the Ningjing ship turned around, the tide was very turbulent at the time, and the ship was pushed by the current. It was not easy to stop it for a while, and the ship collided with the Cas. Fortunately, the owner of the Cas ship quickly pulled back the horn, causing the Ningjing to quickly reverse. Although it tried its best to avoid it, it had already collided. The head of the Cas was hit by the Ningjing, and the head of the Cas was damaged. Afterwards, the ship owners of the two ships reported to their respective companies and sent engineers to the ships to inspect them. As the extent of the damage was still minor, the Ningshao Company admitted to repairing it and dispatched engineers and workers to the Cas to carry out repairs at 11:00 am. Lai Chi also expressed satisfaction. The crew and cargo were not damaged.</p>
<h3>Comedy King Charlie Chaplin Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Comedy king Charlie Chaplin is traveling to the Far East by ship from Europe. When his ship arrived in Hong Kong, the Japanese ship he was on stopped in Wanhu because the war in Shanghai had not yet ended. Therefore, Chaplin went directly to Japan from Hong Kong. Chaplin has been touring the East for more than a month and is now scheduled to take the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's European liner Shokoku Maru from Kobe to Shanghai on the 18th of this month. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. At that time, the Shanghai film industry will definitely give him a warm welcome. It is reported that when Chaplin arrives in Shanghai, he will land at the Huishan Dock.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Police Rescue Many Abducted Children</h3>
<p>Eleven Boys and Girls</p>
<p>Seven Abductors Arrested</p>
<p>Yang Zhaoqing, Liu Zhaonian, and Ding Baoxiang, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, learned that a large number of abductors were hiding in the Xinfake Inn at No. 62 Wuhu Road. Therefore, at 5:40 pm the day before yesterday, they, together with detectives Zhao Lianbi, Bai Mingfu, and Li Zexing, secretly went to the address and arrested seven people, including Wang Xi from Fujian, Wang Honglin from Wuhu, Li Maolin from Henan, Liu Wanyi from Hubei, Yang Youshan from Anhui, and women Li Wangshi and Wang Mashi. Many other suspects were released as irrelevant. They also recovered eleven abducted children, including Yu Er, Ma Baoping, Li Laimao, Yao Fu, Li Hai, He San, Ma Qun, Zhang Aqiao, Xiao Wang, Xiao Baobao, and Wang Xiaobao, ranging in age from twelve to four. They were from Wuxi, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangbei. They were all taken to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately. As the families of the children could not be found for a while, they were temporarily kept at the police station. Yesterday morning, the seven male and female defendants, together with the children, were sent to the first special district court, court one. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the police station requested the court to detain the defendants for further investigation and described the details of the case. The clothes worn by the children were all made of foreign thread cloth, striped cloth, and printed cloth. Their hair was shaved into a monk's head, all of whom were from small families. After Judge Shen Bingrong briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained separately for further investigation and interrogation. The children were temporarily kept at the police station.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaomei Exists 55 Times</h3>
<p>But There is Only One Result</p>
<p>The Second is an Impersonation</p>
<p>The Weitong Factory Lawsuit is Suspicious</p>
<p>The Court Will Investigate the Inside Story</p>
<p>After the Weitong Yarn Factory stopped operating in January last year, it entrusted lawyers and accountants to clear the accounts and pay severance money to all employees. It had already been completed. Later, two people claiming to be workers of the factory, Wang Daofeng and Liu Shuchen, representing 982 male and female workers, denied receiving the 30,000 yuan of severance pay and said that it was embezzled by the liquidators. They even filed a criminal lawsuit against the lawyers and others who were liquidating the factory. When the First Special District District Court summoned them for trial, Sun Fuzeng, the accountant of the Weitong Custody Committee, testified that he had issued the payment. The judge then ruled against the plaintiffs. However, Wang and Liu were angry at Sun after the verdict. They said that Sun had said that he had issued the payment, but the workers had not received it, so Sun had embezzled the payment. They have now filed a lawsuit against Sun. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan opened a court to hear the case. About half of the more than 980 plaintiffs were present, mostly women. Although the court was large, it was difficult to accommodate them completely. Therefore, many people were standing outside the court. The police maintained order, and there was no disturbance. Judge Qiao noticed that there were as many as 55 people named Wang Xiaomei on the list of all the plaintiffs. Therefore, he decided to first summon all the Wang Xiaomeis to the court for questioning and then proceed to the others. Unexpectedly, when the second Wang Xiaomei was called, a female worker stood up, holding a piece of white paper with the words "Wang Xiaomei" written on it. Judge Qiao was very surprised and asked her why she was holding this piece of paper. The woman did not know what to say. When asked what her name was, she said that her name was Chen Asi. When asked what her occupation was, she said that she was currently a worker at the Shenxin Factory. Judge Qiao said that since the plaintiff was a worker at the Weitong Factory, why was she a worker at another factory? He then asked Chen, "Who are you working for?" Chen was still silent. Then he questioned other female workers, but only one person admitted to being Wang Xiaomei. The others sat motionless. Judge Qiao then ruled that the case was dismissed. Wang Daofeng and Liu Shuchen each paid a 2,000 yuan guarantee and waited for the court to investigate the matter with its authority before further review.</p>

<h3>Shipping Industry Requests Exemption from Wartime Ship Tax</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, Representative, Submits a Petition</p>
<p>Exemption for February and March Requested for Offset</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang and others, representatives of the shipping households in the Pudong West, submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday requesting exemption from the ship tax for February and March during the Shanghai war, stating, "The petition is for an earnest request for exemption from the ship tax for February and March during the Shanghai war, to show consideration for the people's hardships. I, the undersigned, have been elected as the representative of the shipping households and have repeatedly petitioned the municipal authorities to alleviate suffering and ensure safety, all of which have been adopted and implemented. However, since the January 28th Incident, the area around Osaka Wharf in Pudong, South Shanghai, has become a sphere of influence for Japanese merchant ships, with two warships berthed there, ostensibly for protection, but in reality, they are in a tense standoff with the shipping docks in Puxi, such as Wanyu and Gongyi, ready to erupt at any moment. Key points along the Bund are blocked with sandbags, heavily guarded, and traffic is cut off. Under this tense situation, shipping boats dare not come to Shanghai to transport goods. Even after the war ceased for some time, the defensive barriers along the Bund in South Shanghai were slow to be removed. Occasionally, ships that arrived in Shanghai could not dock and had to return empty. This lasted for two months, causing huge losses to the shipping households. Currently, there is a type of barge at the wharves, quite numerous, which has already been approved for exemption from wartime ship tax. The shipping boats in Pudong and Puxi are mostly local boats serving the counties and towns near the city, with a long history and a central role in developing the commerce of the South City, and they have very close relations with neighboring communities. The number of ships is limited, and the berths are fixed, without any abuses. Therefore, I dare to submit a detailed list of ship names and respectfully request your review and approval, and kindly instruct the Finance Bureau to follow the precedent and exempt the ships berthing at the designated Nanhui Hall, Gongyi, Yongsheng, and Wanyu wharves from the ship tax for February and March for two months, to be offset against the July and August payments, to show consideration for the shipping households."</p>
<h3>Local Cloth Exhibition Extended for Four Days</h3>
<p>A Propaganda Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The local cloth exhibition initiated by the Shanghai County Agricultural Education Hall, which started on the 13th, is being held at the Penglai Market in the South City. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been visiting enthusiastically. The hall originally scheduled a closing ceremony yesterday morning, but due to requests from the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and various organizations, it has been extended for several days. Therefore, the hall decided to continue the exhibition for four days, moving the closing to the 19th, to meet the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life. Yesterday, the Agricultural Education Hall, in order to promote the advantages of local cloth and advocate its importance, held a grand propaganda meeting at the Tianlewo Bookstore in the market. Representatives from various municipal and county government agencies and organizations, as well as hundreds of members of the public, attended. The meeting was chaired by Shi She, Director of the County Education Bureau, and recorded by Zhang Fengshan. After the formal rituals, the chairman gave a report, followed by speeches from various representatives. The original speeches are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Briefly stated, the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Hall has been holding a small local cloth exhibition here for three days. Today, we are holding a propaganda meeting. We are honored by the attendance of representatives from various agencies and organizations, and we are especially grateful for the enthusiastic help of Mr. Kuang, the owner of this market. The significance of our meeting is, on the one hand, to seek remedies for the rural economy, and on the other hand, to hope that many gentlemen in the city will provide assistance so that this local cloth will gradually improve, sales will gradually increase, and the rural economy will improve, while the prosperity of the city will be boundless. Otherwise, if the rural economy declines to the extreme, the city will also be affected. Moreover, local cloth is cheap and durable. With improvements, it is superior to foreign cloth. Using foreign goods means that rights and interests flow out, while using local cloth means that sources of profit can be preserved. If our compatriots want to be free from the suffering of oppression by imperialists, they must use domestic goods.</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau: Briefly stated, I am very honored to represent the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in attending this meeting. The decline of China's rural economy is due to the inability of local goods to sell well in the market. Therefore, to seek relief, we must promote local goods. This meeting is based on this principle to seek relief for the rural economy. However, local cloth does not meet the needs of society and urgently needs to be improved. This is what I hope for. The rest is omitted.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Shanghai Municipal Special Ferry</h3>
<p>Chartering Large Vessels Facilitates Loading</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Ferry, to maintain transportation between Wusong and Shanghai, has specially dispatched ferries for round-trip service. In addition to striving for passenger comfort, it pays more attention to cargo transportation. Recently, as four ferries are being repaired in rotation, small ferries from Minhang have been chartered as replacements. However, these vessels have a smaller capacity and are insufficient for loading cargo. Therefore, starting from June 15th, the large Pingshen ferry has been chartered instead. Passengers can load as much cargo as possible. The wharf loading and unloading are handled by the sailors of the ferry without any charge. If sailors demand tips for liquor, passengers can record the symbol number and report it to the Public Works Bureau (Municipal Government Road in the New West District) or the Ferry General Management Office (Donggou, Pudong) for investigation.</p>

<h3>The Work of the Young Men's Christian Association Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>The National Association of Young Men's Christian Associations is the central organ for the Young Men's Christian Associations throughout the country, with the purpose of formulating work plans, assisting the development of municipal and school associations, guiding young people, and serving society. Since its establishment, it has been 21 years, and it has made great contributions to our country's society. During this time of national crisis, the association's work is even more intense. The important work of the association over the past year is explored as follows: (1) Relief for Floods. Last year, continuous rain caused disasters. The association organized the "National Young Men's Christian Associations Flood Relief Association." More than 200 city and school Young Men's Christian Associations across the country were mobilized. In addition to cooperating with the National Government's Flood Relief Committee to actively provide relief, it also organized model refugee camps and orphanages in Wuchang, providing food, clothing, medical care, education, and entertainment. Cooperative loan offices were also established in the Wuhu and Nanjing areas, which greatly benefited the refugees. (2) Relief for War Disasters. The day after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the association convened various church organizations in Shanghai to organize the Christian War Zone Refugee Relief Association to carry out two tasks: (a) going to the war zone to rescue compatriots who could not escape; (b) organizing multiple refugee camps to provide food, clothing, medical care, civic education, primary schools, kindergartens, and vocational guidance. Staff members were also dispatched to cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Committee to handle the guidance of citywide refugee personnel. (3) Lectures. (a) The association invited Dr. Eddy to give a four-month tour, giving lectures in more than 20 cities, with an audience of 200,000 people. When the Northeast Incident occurred, Eddy was in Liaoning and telegraphed the League of Nations to certify the atrocities of the Japanese, in order to demonstrate justice. (b) After the Northeast Issue arose, the association hired experts to go to various places to give lectures on supporting popular diplomacy. (4) Publications. In addition to the two regular publications, "Co-Worker" and "News," there is also the "Eugenics Monthly," which promotes racial hygiene. Its recently published "China Weekly" has been distributed throughout the country within just two months and is very popular among young people. As for the book "The Truth About Soviet Russia" published by the Young Men's Christian Association Bookstore, it has contributed greatly to the thinking of young people. (6) Academic Work. The association's work with students covers more than 200 schools, with the principle of being practical and meeting needs. This summer, summer camps will be held throughout the country to help students cultivate themselves during the summer vacation. The general theme this year is "Students and National Crisis." As for the annual "Youth Camp," it will also be held this year as usual to train the youth's bodies.</p>
<h3>The Young Women's Christian Association's Professional Women's Friendship Association</h3>

Excellent results have been achieved. Recently, a rooftop sports field (6th floor of the Women's Bank) has also been opened, so that in this commercial center, there is a special place for sports. Women who work in the service industry all day can participate and relieve their fatigue. It is heard that a professional women's friendship association was held at 7:30 the night before to celebrate the completion of the sports field. Although it rained heavily that day, more than 100 people attended. All programs, such as comic sketches, the "Wind and Sun" debate, and talks, were prepared by the group's amateurs, and the meaning was particularly essential.

<h3>Car Driver Appealed Against the Charge of Enticement</h3>
<p>Chen Cuie'e Could Not Be Served</p>
<p>Debate Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Guan Afu was a car driver at No. 5 Jingan Villa, Jingan Temple Road, namely, the residence of Sun Yunqing, owner of Qinglian Court. His home was located at No. 520 McTyeire Road. During the Sino-Japanese War, Chen Guo, and her daughter Chen Cuie'e, who had escaped from Zhabei, also came to live in the house and cohabited with him. Chen Cuie'e was only eighteen years old and had a charming figure. Unexpectedly, she suddenly disappeared on March 29th. Her mother was anxious and entrusted Guan to help her find her. On April 2nd, Guan suddenly saw Chen Cuie'e talking to a young man on Hubei Road, the Fourth Avenue. He stepped forward to persuade her to return home, but the girl refused. He immediately reported to the patrolman at No. 3218 Ruitian Corner, who temporarily took them to the Qinglian Court tea house to persuade her to return home. On the one hand, Guan went to McTyeire Road to accompany her mother home. Unexpectedly, her mother was out, so her aunt and her younger brother persuaded her to return. Afterward, her mother asked her daughter who had induced her to go out. At first, she refused to say, but later she confessed that Guan had induced her. It turned out that on March 27th, after Cuie'e was scolded by her mother, Guan took the opportunity to persuade her, and she fell for it. Her mother reported the matter to the police the next day. After the detectives questioned her in detail, the girl did not admit that Guan had induced her while she was with her mother. Afterward, she confessed that Guan had induced her and had sex with her for three nights when questioned separately. The police dispatched a doctor to examine Chen Cuie'e and found that she was no longer a virgin, but they could not determine when she had lost her virginity. The police then charged Guan with the crime of intending to commit adultery and enticing a woman under the age of twenty to leave her parent's custody and prosecuted him in the First Special District Court. In the first instance, Guan was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Guan refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The trial opened yesterday. According to Guan's testimony, this was entirely a case of well-intentioned actions causing trouble. He was only angered because he strongly persuaded her to return home and was falsely accused in return. Moreover, the Qinglian Court patrol manager Yang Deji and patrolmen were also present at the scene, and he had never had sex with her while driving the car at Sun's residence day and night. Therefore, he neither intended to entice her into adultery nor enticed her to sell herself. It was all motivated by a spirit of human mutual aid to find her and force her to return. Because the victim Chen Cuie'e's family had moved elsewhere and the summons could not be served, witnesses were questioned after passing their prior testimony. It was announced that the debate would begin. The police lawyer and the appeal lawyer debated after each other. The court adjourned, announcing that the judgment would be announced on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua's House Servant Accused Tong Huitang of Insult</h3>
<p>Tong Also Filed a Counter-Suit</p>
<p>Both Were Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Tao Suzhen, a Suzhou woman who was formerly a house servant at Sai Jinhua's place on Shantou Road, recently left her courtesan status and rented a house at No. 8 Dagu Road. She initially lived with a man named Xue Bingchu. Xue was later sued by Tong Huitang, the owner of Xingye Wood Shop at No. 1249 Beijing Road, for debt in the First Special District Court. The case concluded, Xue did not fulfill the judgment, and the court ordered compulsory execution and detained Xue. However, all of Xue's past summons and other documents were sent by Tao Suzhen's home for forwarding. This time, Tong still recognized that Xue and Tao were living together, so on May 24th, he went to Tao's house with the bailiff to arrest Xue. When they arrived at Tao's house, Tao was sitting on the toilet defecating. The crowd rushed in, and Tao was unable to cope and found it difficult to get up. Tong also spoke vulgar words of abuse. Tao felt unwilling and hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing him of public insult. The trial opened yesterday. Tao testified that she had broken up with Xue a long time ago and now received 100 silver dollars per month from a Chen surnamed man to maintain her life. Now that she had been insulted and scolded by him and the police had been brought to her home to search, the Chen surnamed guest had learned about it and thought she was not devoted, so he had stopped providing her with money. Therefore, she requested that he be punished for the crime of insult and that a civil lawsuit be attached for a monthly allowance of 100 silver dollars.</p>

<h3>Ku Wei-chün Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lushan Conference Concludes Successfully   Actively Pursuing the Recovery of the Northeast   Various Sectors to Hold慰勞 Meeting Today   Ku Will Fly Back North Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Dr. Ku Wei-chün, the Chinese representative accompanying the League of Nations Northeast Investigation Commission, traveled from Beijing to Xun on a plane with Wang Jingwei, Luo Wenggan, and others the day before yesterday to participate in the Lushan Conference and discuss foreign affairs, finance, and military matters. He returned to Beijing at 4 p.m. yesterday and then traveled to Shanghai by plane with Liu Chongjie and advisor Donald, arriving at Hongqiao Airport at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. Today, various sectors will hold a meeting to慰勞 him. Ku is scheduled to fly back north tomorrow morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Party   Upon learning of Ku's arrival in Shanghai yesterday, representatives from various sectors went to Hongqiao Airport to welcome him, starting at 4 p.m. A portion of the welcomers mistakenly went to Longhua Airport, resulting in them missing his arrival. Zhang Xianglin, director of the representative团驻沪办, Ku's brother Ku Weixin, and dozens of Ku's relatives and friends were all at Hongqiao Airport to greet him.</p>
<p>Plane Arrives in Shanghai   Ku left Xun at 11:15 a.m. yesterday morning with Foreign Minister Luo on Chiang Kai-shek's seaplane, arriving in Beijing at approximately 4 p.m. He then, along with Zhang Xueliang's advisor Donald, Hysell, advisor to the representative团, Ku Shanchang, Xiao Jirong (who arrived in Beijing yesterday morning from Peiping), Liu Chongjie, vice minister of foreign affairs, and You Mijian (a total of seven people) flew from Beijing on a Ford aircraft at 4:10 p.m. The flight was very fast, and they were spotted at Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport at 5:30 p.m. After circling once, they landed safely. Ku was helped down by an attendant, appearing calm and composed. He was wearing a light yellow suit and a Panama hat. Zhang Xianglin, Ku Weixin, and others welcoming him rushed forward to shake hands. Newspaper reporters surrounded Ku to take photos and offer their greetings.</p>

<p>Welcome from All Sectors   Ku is scheduled to meet with representatives from various sectors and visit friends this morning. At 3 p.m. this afternoon, Zhang Xianglin, director of the representative团驻沪办, will host a tea party for newspaper reporters at the Bank Association, inviting Ku to report on everything. At 4 p.m., the National Disaster Relief Association will hold a慰勞 meeting at the Chinese 社. At 5 p.m., the local association will also hold a grand welcoming party.</p>
<p>Public Lecture   At 7:30 p.m. tonight, Ku will give a public lecture at the auditorium of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge, reporting on the work of the League of Nations Investigation Commission in the Northeast and the suffering Ku personally endured. Mayor Wu Tiecheng has also been invited to attend.</p>
<p>Heading North Tomorrow Morning   Dr. Ku Wei-chün's hurried trip to Shanghai is scheduled for a one-day stay. Tomorrow morning, he will take Zhang Xueliang's Ford aircraft back to Beijing and then return to Beiping to meet with the Investigation Commission and discuss everything.</p>
<p>Ku's Remarks   Newspaper reporters had a brief conversation with Ku when he disembarked and then visited him at his private residence at 9 p.m. to inquire about everything in detail. The following summarizes Ku's remarks: Ku said, "Yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday), I went to Lushan with President Wang, Foreign Minister Luo, and others to visit Chiang. This afternoon (i.e., yesterday) at 4 p.m., Foreign Minister Luo and I returned to Beijing together. I then, at 4:05 p.m., traveled by plane from Beijing to Shanghai with my entourage. I am very grateful for the warm welcome from everyone here. After entering the customs, I have already given several talks. This time, I participated in the investigation in the Northeast for about seven weeks. Everything regarding the treatment of our Chinese representative团 and what I saw and heard was heartbreaking. When I was in the Northeast, it was truly like 'living like years.' Before I left the customs, I repeatedly received kindness from all parties. Both Chinese and foreign friends were very concerned and tried to dissuade me in every way. However, because I had a mission and a duty to the country, I disregarded everything and resolutely went. After six or seven weeks of experience after leaving the customs, I feel that the various sufferings and hardships experienced by myself and the representative团 colleagues… (incomplete sentence). However, the various sufferings experienced by myself and the representative团 colleagues this time are short-term. Compared to the sufferings of the 30 million compatriots in the eastern provinces, which are of unknown duration, the two cannot be compared. Therefore, the suffering we experienced this time cannot be considered a special circumstance. Therefore, although my safe return to Shanghai has given me physical freedom, at the same time, every time I think of my compatriots in the eastern provinces and the various tragic scenes I witnessed in the eastern provinces, they still revolve in my mind and I am still very sad. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will pay close attention to the suffering of our compatriots in the eastern provinces, especially hoping that the people of Shanghai will not think that the life and death and suffering of the eastern provinces are irrelevant because they are thousands of miles away. We must know that the eastern provinces have historically been the source of aggression against our country. The eastern provinces are a barrier to the interior. If the eastern provinces are not recovered, the interior will be in great danger."</p>
<p>Lushan Conference   Then, reporters asked Ku about the results of the Lushan Conference. Ku replied, "At the two conferences in Lushan, a concrete decision has been made on the foreign policy. We are determined to recover the lost territory of the Northeast as soon as possible through active methods. Our diplomacy with Japan will continue to be based on the principle of 'resistance on the one hand and negotiation on the other,' and we will work hard to proceed. Other important matters regarding finance and military affairs have also been decided upon, and all parties are in complete agreement." (Question) "What specific measures will the government take to actively recover the lost territory of the Northeast? Will it still rely entirely on the League of Nations?" (Answer) "In addition to reporting on the situation in the Northeast this time, I am contributing my personal opinions to the central government on the recovery of the lost territory of the Northeast. The Lushan Conference has decided to expand diplomatic channels on the Northeast issue and proceed simultaneously in all directions." (Question) "The League of Nations Investigation Commission is going to Japan. The government had instructed you to accompany them eastward. Has it now been decided whether you will go to Japan?" (Answer) "Regarding the matter of going to Japan, the government has decided to order me to go eastward. Therefore, it has been decided that I will go with the Investigation Commission." (Question) "Where has the Investigation Commission decided to draft its report?" (Answer) "It has now been decided to start drafting in Tokyo and complete it in Peiping." (Question) "What are the feelings of the commissioners from various countries on the League of Nations Investigation Commission regarding the eastern provinces?" (Answer) "The commissioners from various countries are currently collecting materials. Before drafting the report, the commissioners will not express any opinions on this matter. Even the entire report in the future must be agreed upon by all five commissioners before it can be decided. Since they are not yet able to express their opinions, I have no way of guessing." (Question) "Was the matter of resuming diplomatic relations between China and Russia discussed during your time in Beijing and Lushan?" (Answer) "The central government has already decided on a method for this matter and is waiting to proceed. The various rumors reported by the newspapers previously are not accurate." (Question) "What are your feelings about the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia?" (Answer) "There are different ways to resume diplomatic relations, and it depends on how they are used. It can be done from an international perspective, or it can be done in all aspects simultaneously. I have no particular opinion on this."</p>
<p>Visiting Lin Sen   At 9:30 p.m. last night, Mayor Wu visited Ku at his residence. At 10 p.m., Wu and Ku went together to the residence of National Government Chairman Lin Sen on 金神父 Road. Ku reported on the situation in the Northeast and the proceedings of the Lushan Conference in great detail. At 10:40 p.m., they went together to the train station. After Chairman Lin was warmly welcomed at the station, he took the 11 p.m. night train back to Beijing. Ku and Wu shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Have Agreed to Complete Withdrawal</h3>
<p>We Are Preparing to Take Over in the Next Day or Two   Japanese Troops in Zone D Still Need to Remain Temporarily</p>
<p>More than six weeks have passed since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, but the Japanese Marine Corps has not only failed to completely withdraw from the temporarily stationed area but has also failed to withdraw as agreed from the area stipulated in the Armistice Agreement to be completely withdrawn within four weeks of signing. Although Yu Hongjun, a member of our Joint Committee, has repeatedly negotiated with Japanese member Okazaki, there has been no concrete response. It was not until the third Joint Committee meeting on the 13th that Yu again urged Okazaki in person, and Okazaki finally agreed to withdraw within three to five days. However, Yu indicated at the time that if the Japanese troops did not withdraw by the 15th, he would submit the matter to the Joint Committee for resolution. However, Yu had not received any news from the Japanese side until the night before last, so he called Okazaki to</p>
<p>Consult Yesterday Morning   The two sides met at the US Consulate at approximately 10 a.m. yesterday morning. Yu immediately asked Okazaki whether there was a date for the withdrawal of the Japanese troops currently stationed within the boundary. Okazaki replied at the time that he agreed to first withdraw the Japanese Marine Corps in the area east of Songhu Road, west of Shajing Port, and north of Hongkou, and that our side could go to take over immediately. However, Zone D in the Armistice Agreement still needs to be delayed for a while. Once the date is confirmed, we will be notified again. Yu was satisfied with this and immediately notified the takeover committee to prepare to go to take over the above-mentioned area. Yin Rugeng, chairman of the takeover committee, immediately sent Yin Tixin to contact the Japanese authorities. At 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, he convened a takeover meeting with all relevant parties and decided to</p>
<p>Inspect This Morning   Xie Zhidao, Liu Yumen, Cha Nanqiang, Jin Gong of the takeover committee, Yin Tixin of the Public Security Bureau, Niu Jingjian of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, Gong Xikui of the Supervision Office, Ju Jing of the First Branch of the Fifth District, Huang Ming of the Shanghai North Settlement Office, and Shao Yiming, district chief of the Fifth District, etc., are scheduled to depart from Lianshe this morning to inspect and make arrangements, and then</p>
<p>Take Over Tomorrow   The police will also go tomorrow to set up posts and handle all matters. Regarding the takeover of Zone D, Commissioner Yu said that it will also be within a few days. According to</p>
<p>The Takeover Area   The takeover area is east of the Songhu Railway, west of Shajing Port, north of the concession, and a portion of the jurisdictions of the Fifth District, the First Branch of the Fifth District, and the Third Branch of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the entire jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the Fifth District. As for the Japanese troops temporarily stationed in Zone D (the area around the 63rd Garden), they have also decided to withdraw in a day or two and hand it over to our side, it is said.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Returned to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Had Lunch at Chen Mingshu's Residence Yesterday   Took the Night Train to Beijing and Will Soon Transfer to Xun</p>
<p>National Government Chairman Lin Sen visited Minister of Finance Song Ziwen at Qiqi Road at 7 p.m. the night before last, earnestly urging Song to resume his post. After talking for about half an hour, Lin left. It is said that Song has not yet made a definite statement on resuming his post. Chairman Lin, accompanied by National Government Military Counselor Lü Chao, went out at approximately 7 a.m. yesterday morning. At 10 a.m., he went to Shanzhong Road to visit Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu. At noon, he had lunch at Chen's residence. Chen reportedly told people that he was eager to get out of the political vortex and was determined to resign this time. He would not receive anyone visiting on political matters. Chairman Lin visited the residence to talk based on personal friendship, it is said. Lin took the night train to Beijing at 11 p.m. last night. Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Ku Wei-chün went to the station to see Lin off after visiting him. It is said that after arriving in Beijing, Chairman Lin plans to transfer to a plane to Xun to meet with Wang, Chiang, and others.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu National Disaster Relief Association Seeks Aid for Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Circular Telegram to the Whole Country for Substantial Assistance   Donated 2,000 Yuan, Which Has Been Transferred</p>
<p>The Jiangsu National Disaster Relief Association issued a circular telegram to the whole country, stating, "To all agencies and organizations in the country: The fall of the Northeast to the enemy has caused grief and indignation throughout the country. The government has not been heard of any attempt to recover the lost territory, causing 30 million compatriots to groan under the iron hooves of a powerful enemy, living a subhuman life for nine months. Fortunately, there are volunteer armies rising from the grass roots, assisting Generals Ma Du, Li, and others in the north, and supporting the 19th Route Army in the south. Their righteous reputation is admired by all. Their spirit of bravely resisting the enemy and stepping forward despite sacrifices is enough to make the stubborn and cowardly stand up and maintain the integrity of the country. However, this volunteer army is mostly composed of patriotic people, and their military pay and weapons are not taken from the public. The source of economic income is inevitably often difficult. If they have already given up their lives for righteousness, but the material needs are not provided, it will not only discourage patriots but also please the enemy. Today, the Japanese army is gathering in large numbers, and the pressure is increasing. Continuing resistance requires more material resources. If it is taken advantage of by the enemy due to insufficient economic resources, losing one brave soldier on the battlefield means losing one point of vitality for the nation. The situation is urgent, and things change in an instant. We sincerely hope that our government authorities will pay special attention to these loyal and brave citizens who are purely dedicated and willing to risk their lives. We also hope that all organizations, agencies, and compatriots in the country will consider that the three eastern provinces are an important barrier to our entire China, and the Northeast Volunteer Army is the reliance of the spirit of our entire Chinese nation. We feel each other's pain and cannot ignore each other's righteousness. Do your best to increase assistance. The colleagues of our association, based on this purpose, have first managed to raise 2,000 yuan, entrusted to others to transfer, to do our best and fulfill our duty. Everyone wants to do good, who is not like me? Patriotic people, why not come? We hereby telegraph our request, hoping you will understand. Ma Liang and others of the Jiangsu Provincial National Disaster Relief Association pay their respects."</p>
<h3>British Troops to Withdraw from Illegally Built Roads Within Days</h3>
<p>British Consulate Replies to Municipal Government's Letter</p>
<p>Regarding the two locations on Qiaodun Road near the illegally built roads in western Shanghai and on Kaixuan Road near Bailinan Road, where British troops were stationed, the Municipal Government sent a letter on the 10th urging the British Consul General to order the withdrawal of troops, which was published in the newspapers on the 12th. It is now learned that British Consul General Sir John Brenan replied to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "I have received your letter and have forwarded it to the military authorities for handling. The work of withdrawing the troops and obstacles from the area can be completed within a few days." Therefore, everything in the area should be restored to its original state soon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Illegally Built Roads Case</h3>
<p>To Establish Special Administrative District</p>
<p>The issue of illegally built roads in Shanghai has been negotiated to a certain extent by representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council. It can be implemented after submission to the government authorities and the Shanghai Municipal Council for approval. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council discussed this agreement at its board meeting last night. The content of the agreement reportedly involves establishing a special administrative district in the area of illegally built roads. The administrative committee will be jointly organized by personnel recommended by the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council. The chairman of the administrative committee will be appointed by our side, and the vice-chairman will be recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council. A special police force will be formed separately to maintain治安. The police chief will be appointed by our side, and the deputy police chief will be appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The administrative expenses will be jointly borne by the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council. The巡捐 and sanitation matters will be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Municipal Public Works Bureau will issue special notices for electricity, telephone, and tap water, which will be handled by the company under the concession, it is said.</p>
<h3>First Preparatory Meeting for Chicago World's Fair Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo Attends in Person to Give a Speech   Central Government Allocates 400,000 Yuan in Special Subsidies   Location of Government Pavilion in Fairgrounds Has Been Surveyed   Hoping That All Industries Can Automatically Stand Up and Work Hard</p>
<p>China's participation in the American Chicago World's Fair was held at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road at 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon. In addition to Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo personally coming to Shanghai to preside over the meeting, various industrial circles in Shanghai enthusiastically participated. The details of the meeting are listed below:</p>
<p>Attendees   The attendees at the meeting yesterday included Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Director of the International Trade Bureau He Bingxian, Director of the Commercial Department Zhang Yichou, Xu Xiqing and Xu Lingyun of the Ministry of Transportation, and experts and industrialists Guo Bingwen, Du Bingwen, Mu Ouchu, Wang Yunwu, Lu Feibo Hong, Zhang Xianglin, Liu Hongsheng, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Jian, Wang Hanliang, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Cai Wuji, He Xikang, Guo Chuntao, Jin Yulian, Tang Jisan, Qian Xinzhi, Ren Siyuan, Miao Zhongxiu, Kong Shie, Cai Shengbai, Shi Liangcai, Wang Boqi, Xu Xinliu, Xu Ji, Chu Minyi, Zhu Nong, Mei Zhesan, Xu Lisheng, and others, totaling over 70 people, presided over by Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo.</p>
<p>Agenda of the Meeting   The agenda of the meeting was as follows: (1) Ringing the bell to start the meeting, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Pay the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister, (4) Chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will, (5) Silence, (6) Minister gives opening remarks, (7) Director Zhang reports, (8) Committee members speak, (9) Proposed matters, (10) Temporary motions, (11) Photography, (12) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo's Speech   Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo said in his speech, "The preparatory committee for the Republic of China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair is holding its first meeting today. All of you present, especially the appointed committee members, are extremely busy people. I am grateful for your enthusiastic participation, which is a very good phenomenon. I should thank you on behalf of the government. The United States is a rising country, and Chicago is also a rising city. A century ago, Chicago was a very remote colony of the United States. After a century of effort, active construction, and gradual development, it has become the center of agriculture and industry in the United States, with a population of 4.5 million people. Therefore, it will hold a World's Fair next year to commemorate its 100 years of glorious history. In these 100 years, science has advanced rapidly, and everything has been affected, changing day by day and year by year. This is true of the entire city of Chicago, the entire United States, and the entire world. Therefore, US President Hoover has declared that this World's Fair will be renamed the Centennial Progress Memorial Exhibition, with content divided into seven categories: science, art, drama, sports, industry, agriculture, and the great achievements of celebrities in various fields. He wants to invite all countries in the world to compete in which country has done what work and achieved what results in those categories from 1834 to 1933. They should bring items, attach charts, and explain in detail, showing the progress made step by step every five or ten years, and bring machines and employees to demonstrate on the spot as much as possible. More concretely, there is the declaration of the fair authorities and the letter written to me. They hope that participating countries will each build a government pavilion, saying that it is temporary and will be dismantled after five months, so they do not want to spend too much money. What should be noted is that the buildings and exhibits should be sufficient to show the characteristics of the participating country. In the case of China, the architecture should be Chinese style, and the exhibits should also be unique to China. As for ordinary manufactured goods and commodities, they said that although they would not prevent them, they should be displayed separately in the special pavilions or sub-pavilions of the seven major categories to compete with similar items from other countries. They also said that the exhibitors or individuals should comprehensively plan how the products should be displayed before regulations can be made, but it does not go beyond the following points: (1) the main history of science, (2) the relationship between science and mankind, (3) the trend of scientific inventions. In short, the nature of this Chicago World's Fair is scientific, the restrictions are very strict, and it is very difficult to participate. Although our country received the invitation as early as February 19, we did not decide to participate until March of last year due to the situation and financial constraints. The budget was only 400,000 yuan. Due to floods and national disasters following one after another, the Ministry of Finance did not agree to allocate the funds in succession until now. Therefore, our ministry has not been able to start preparing until today. The World's Fair has been scheduled to open on June 1 and close on November 1 next year. There is only one year left until the opening date. It is naturally even more difficult to prepare for this World's Fair, which is not easy to participate in, with only one year of short time and 400,000 cheap silver dollars. However, we can console ourselves and encourage each other that there is an old saying that 'everything depends on human effort.' International exhibitions have been held for more than 130 years since Napoleon founded the first one in Paris in 1798. Our country officially sent personnel to participate, starting with the American St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, which is also nearly 30 years ago. I have examined the achievements of previous participation and hope to improve future participation, dividing them into three methods or three periods, briefly speaking: (1) the period of routine participation. The Qing Dynasty regarded foreign exhibitions as a kind of social occasion, initially entrusting the Customs Service to handle them, so all the exhibits were naturally inappropriate. In the 30th year of Guangxu (i.e., 1904), when participating in the St. Louis World's Fair, although a special supervisor (查係黄開中) was appointed to take charge, the old method of the Customs Service was still followed, bringing many city gods, bodhisattvas, gods of wealth, land gods, bridegrooms, brides, idols, as well as opium pipes, bow shoes, and various instruments of torture, which are still cherished by Americans today and displayed in museums. (2) The period of research participation. Because a Nanyang劝业会 was held in the late Qing Dynasty, and there were reference pavilions of various countries in the hội, people from political and business circles suddenly realized something after seeing them. Therefore, since the Republic of China, each time participating in foreign exhibitions has also made some obvious progress. For example, when participating in the Panama World's Fair in the fourth year of the Republic of China, a preparatory office was established in Beijing, product associations were established in various provinces, and product branches were established in various counties. The preparations were very serious, and there was considerable research on the selection, decoration, and display of products, washing away the previous bad habits. However, various products were collected from various provinces and counties, and the General Administration could not strictly determine what to take and what to leave, nor could it use science.</p>

<p>Tao Yanquan slanderously insulted Lu Zilu, and other circumstances. There is a承發吏 who can testify, so I am countersuing for false accusation. Subsequently, Chengfa Li Lü Zhao testified that he had not heard of any insults. Presiding Judge Fu Lin commented that both parties had filed a lawsuit over trivial matters, which was inappropriate. Moreover, the evidence was insufficient, and he declared both parties not guilty.</p>
<h3>Robber Who Robbed Zhao Zhongqing on the Road Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhao Zhongqing was robbed by a gang of thieves while walking on Lloyd Road at 8:30 p.m. on April 1, losing public bonds and cash totaling 1,665 yuan. He immediately reported to the Laoza Police Station and requested an investigation. It was not until the day before yesterday that Detective Wang Jiaju arrested three robbers in the French Concession, Xia Deqiang, Zhu Hegen, and Chen Ziqing. According to their confession, the main culprit, a certain Jia, was hiding in room 24 of the Hai Tong Chun Hotel on Yunnan Road. Detective Wang and a Western detective went to arrest him, but Jia and Yi had fled after hearing the news, and only Lü A'gen, Nie Yongxing, Geng Fu'an, and others were arrested. It was also discovered that Lü was a well-known gangster, nicknamed "Flower Butterfly," who specialized in extortion. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the investigation of the defendants was still ongoing and requested an extension. Judge Qian briefly questioned them and ordered them to be detained, and the interrogation was rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Recent Inquiry at Taizhou Hospital</h3>
<p>Since the national crisis, the temporary clinic of Taizhou Hospital on Min'guo Road in this port has continued to provide medical services. After the disaster of war, epidemics have become more common, so Chinese and Western medical services are increasingly busy. It is also heard that the Chinese medicine department of the hospital has pre-ordered special discount coupons from Kuangshengtang Pharmacy to reduce the cost of medicine for patients. Those who are poor and helpless are given medicine by the hospital at its own expense, it is said.</p>
<h3>Two Theaters Show Old Jinghua at the Same Time Today</h3>
<p>The first film with sound from Star Film Company, the fully 上發音 You Sheng movie "Old Jinghua," received excellent reviews after its first public screening in Shanghai. It was generally recognized as a successful Chinese-made sound film. Because this film had noble aspirations, delicate performances, and was very stimulating, it was quite capable of moving the audience's emotions. In terms of production, it also had quite an aesthetic sense. This is indeed the achievement of both material and talent, which cannot be compared to those who are hastily made. It was subsequently screened at the New Central Theater on Haining Road. However, due to the strike of the newspaper office, it did not receive as much publicity as possible, so very few people knew about it. It is heard that the theater has decided to re-screen the film for three days starting today, and the Kader Grand Theater on Kader Road will also screen the film at the same time, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wang Hanlun Continues to Perform</h3>
<p>Beauty expert Ms. Wang Hanlun has been performing beauty secrets at the Wing On Company for several days. The number of famous ladies from Shanghai who went to visit was no less than 200 people every day. Ms. Wang publicly demonstrated and explained the beauty methods in detail, and distributed brocade bags with beauty secrets. This book explains the details, and there must be 100 people a day who write letters from home and abroad to ask for it. It was originally scheduled to complete the performance today (16th), but because it has been specially for the reception of female guests for many days, people from all walks of life have expressed regret. In response to the requirements of all parties, it will continue for half a day tomorrow afternoon. Men and women are welcome.</p>
<h3>Detective License Lost and Invalidated</h3>
<p>Detective Cai Liangen of the French Concession Police Station lost a wallet while going out on official business a few days ago. In addition to dozens of yuan in cash and business cards, the detective license issued by the French Concession Police Station was also lost. Detective Cai immediately reported to the supervisor for a new license to be reissued to perform his duties and cancelled the old license. He is afraid that the old license will be picked up by bad people and used to impersonate and swindle. If people from all walks of life encounter such incidents, they can immediately report to the nearest police station or the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Please do not be fooled.</p>
<h3>Dr. Luo Weisheng's Clinic Relocation</h3>
<p>After graduating from the Guangdong Two-Cantons Higher Specialized Medical School, female doctor Luo Weisheng immediately began practicing medicine, and has been in practice for nearly 20 years. Her medical knowledge is profound and her experience is rich. Last year, she came to Shanghai from Guangdong, specializing in Western-style obstetrics for both men and women. She is tirelessly generous and has saved countless lives. Recently, due to the expansion of her medical practice, she has specially relocated her clinic to 4 Xinsheng Lane, North Sichuan Road (opposite the Guangdong Grand Theater), where she will continue to practice as usual and offer free medical services for one month.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Dahua Company</h3>
<p>The Blue Tiger Brand floral fabric and yarn thread sold by Dahua Company on Wuma Road in this city have always been popular among buyers due to their wide variety of patterns and reasonable prices. It is now reported that the company, in order to promote sales and reward loyal customers, in addition to continuing to dispatch vendors to sell along the streets and establishing 15 branch stores, has also added a retail fashion department to its headquarters on the east side of Qipan Street on Wuma Road. It has specially hired professional technicians to meticulously produce Chinese and Western clothing on a grand scale with luxurious equipment, which is rare at the moment. It is also reported that the company will officially open on the 19th of this month and hold a large giveaway for three days, with a buy-one-get-one-free offer at the original price. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: It has come to our attention that in today's edition of your esteemed newspaper, in the local news section, it was reported that Pei Zheng School teachers Ni Jieshi and Li Lifeng, impersonating investigators from this association, carrying forged official documents bearing the name of Mr. Zhong Ketuo, Vice Chairman of the Anti-Opium Association, suddenly went to Tang Youguang's house to search for opium, attempting to extort money. Their scheme failed and they were arrested. This is deeply regrettable. After investigation, it is confirmed that this association has no investigators, and that direct searches for opium and arrests of opium offenders are all within the scope of local administration and have absolutely nothing to do with this association. Nor have we ever sent personnel to investigate externally. In the future, no matter when or where, if anyone claims to be appointed by this association to handle the above-mentioned illegal activities, they can be immediately arrested and sent to the local government for investigation in order to deter illegal activities. Furthermore, Mr. Zhong Ketuo is a member of the Central Anti-Opium Committee, not the Vice Chairman of this association. These statements are hereby made in conjunction, and we hope that your esteemed newspaper will disclose them, for which we would be immensely grateful. Respectfully, The China National Anti-Opium Association, June 15th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I recently read in the June 15th edition of your newspaper that the total amount of losses from the war has reached 160 million yuan, which is quite surprising. After investigation, the loss registration forms received by our office are currently being sorted and verified. Detailed statistics have not yet been completed. We respectfully request that you correct this matter. Respectfully, The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Certified Public Accountants Association, Joint Office for Investigating War Losses, June 15th, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>A Few Skills</p>
<h3>From Fascisti to Zhong Kui</h3>
<p>— Zhan</p>
<p>Fascisti are a foreign political party, and Zhong Kui was a Jinshi scholar of the Tang Dynasty. There should be no connection between them, but I insist on making one.</p>
<p>Fascisti is the transliteration of "Fascisti." If translated by meaning, it could be translated as "Clubbing Party" or "Blackshirt Party." The Japanese also translate it as "Pan-System Party," which is also a transliteration without any meaning.</p>
<p>This political party emerged after the European War. It is an extreme form of nationalism and chivalry. Since being promoted by Mussolini, the Italian Prime Minister, it is now also rising in the East, leading to the death of Inukai Tsuyoshi! The power of the Fascisti is enough to make ordinary dignitaries feel fear.</p>
<p>I think that instead of translating it as the meaningless "Fascisti," it would be better to translate it as the literal "Hair and Beard Standing Up." Fortunately, "Hair and Beard Standing Up" is homophonic with "Fascisti." When people see these four characters, they can already imagine the ferocious face of extreme imperialism and chivalry.</p>
<p>If we remove the suffix and simply refer to it, we can call it the "Hair and Beard Standing Up Party" or "Hair and Beard Standing Up-ism." Such a party with angry hair and beards cannot but inspire fear!</p>
<p>Someone, hearing me say this, pointed to a painting of Zhong Kui with his hair and beard standing on end hanging in the hall, and said to me with a smile:</p>
<p>He is also a Fascisti, he also has his hair and beard standing up.</p>
<h3>Pitiful are the Great Sky-dwellers of Shanyin</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The above title is a line from a poem by Huang Huiwen lamenting Zhu Zhenzhuang in the past. Zhu, from Shaoxing, was named Zongyuan, styled Zhenchang, and also known as the "Great-to-be-Resident." He had a broad understanding of various books and was proficient in the study of practical governance. During the Guangxu and Xuantong reigns of the late Qing Dynasty, he assisted the Governor of Jiangsu and the Governor-General of Huguang, Rui Cheng. He worked with Li Bake, Xia Jiancheng, Zhu Jishuwen, and Wang Raosheng, with whom he had deep connections. After the Restoration, he successively served as the Zhejiang Telegraph Administration Supervisor, Secretary of the State Council in Beijing, Secretary of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, and editor at the Commercial Press. He was diligent, careful, and capable, and was highly regarded by his peers. Last winter, he fell ill in his Shanghai residence. He recovered and relapsed repeatedly, passing away on April 26th. He lived to the age of fifty-eight. His great ambition was not fulfilled, and he passed away in poor health. Fellow literati deeply mourned his passing. San Yuanlao wrote the epitaph for his tombstone, titled "The Tomb of Mr. Zhu Zhenzhuang, the Poet." Fu Danlin wrote, "Zhenzhuang passed away suddenly. His talent is a pity."</p>
<p>The resident was skilled in poetry and prose, and especially proficient in calligraphy. Wang Bijang's "Roll Call of Generals in the Guangxu and Xuantong Poetry Circles" compared him to the Earthly Hero Star, Peng Qi, stating that the resident's poetry had a lasting and profound taste, and that he and Jun An were regarded as having two excellences. Indeed. His surviving poems and drafts total more than two thousand. His colleagues are planning to compile and publish them, a task of elucidating the profound and a responsibility of those who survive him. The resident was fond of collecting ancient books and had a rich collection, especially of fine editions. In the summer of the eighteenth year, his Hangzhou residence caught fire, and his collection was completely destroyed. His family barely escaped with their lives. He felt great sorrow. His white hair was disheveled, like that of an elderly man in his twilight years. He often engaged in lively conversations. Occasionally, when he met a close friend, he would talk endlessly. One day, he showed a photograph to his friend Lu Danlin and asked, "Does it resemble me?" Lu jokingly replied, "This is a film of a plaster statue." The resident smiled and improvised a quatrain: "Old friends jokingly call me a plaster statue, the wild guest suspects himself to be a mummy. My bones have not decayed and my energy remains, my songs are still those of a youth." His humor and wit were like this.</p>
<p>During his illness, the resident remained clear-headed. Even while bedridden, he did not stop composing poetry. A few days before his death, he even drafted three elegiac couplets for himself. One reads: "Death is also a great difficulty, three months have passed calmly; life, why should I cling to it, my heart has always been upheld." The second reads: "Waving my hand to write my last words, it is still too early; cleansing myself in this chaotic world, I have striven for its difficulty." The third reads: "Alas, Zhu Zhenzhuang, I do not wish to die at the hands of women; serenely, in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, I return before Amitabha Buddha." There is a strong spirit within the sorrow, leaving one in a daze upon reading it.</p>
<p>Although the funeral is over, his orphans still need to be raised, and his collected works still need to be published. Now, You Ren, Yazi, Jiping, Yuhu, Hang Yan, and Yichu have initiated a fundraising campaign. The public notice is full of emotion. It is said to be written by the hands of many different people. It states: "Our late friend Zhu Jun Zhenzhuang devoted himself to plain learning early in life and was troubled by minor official positions later in life. His room had no stored grain, and his family was surrounded by bare walls. In the past, when he was in charge of telegraph administration in Zhejiang Province, he remained uncorrupted. His peers praised him. He was only rich in his collection of books, which were also completely destroyed in the fire. In recent years, he has been floating in Shanghai, and his life has become increasingly difficult. He suddenly contracted a severe illness and passed away. His widow and concubines have no means to support themselves. His seven children who have not yet been married still need to be educated. His posthumous works are locked in a chest and should also be urgently entrusted to someone to widely disseminate them. Remembering that friendship and righteousness are the joy of a lifetime, and that helping the weak and expressing the subtle is the responsibility of those who survive. It is hoped that you will not forget our deceased friend and will generously contribute. It is said that many hands make light work, and that every little helps. This will allow the widow and orphans to barely survive, and prevent the compiled works from being scattered and lost. The living and the dead will be grateful. How can there be an end to it?"</p>
<h3>Records of Notable Figures' Little Quirks</h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a veteran of the business community, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, have both reached a high level in their speaking styles and gestures. It is a pity that they have a slight husky voice, which is a slight imperfection. The Family Industry Society sells record-cleaning glue that can prevent old records from crackling. If they could also invent a good medicine to moisturize the throat, then the speeches of the two gentlemen would be unparalleled in Shanghai. When Master Xiao sings Peking Opera, his voice is loud and magnificent, with a unique charm. This is his natural advantage. Mr. Xu Xinliu and lawyer Chen Tingrui are both elegant and handsome, and their faces are as round as those of wealthy men. They are often mistaken for each other due to their nearsightedness. However, lawyer Chen suddenly lost his second son this summer, and he is deeply saddened. As a result, his complexion is slightly pale yellow. For a time, there was talk of "Xu white and Chen yellow."</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Yun Chu, the boss of the monosodium glutamate factory, is skilled in Tai Chi. I once watched him perform at my second elder brother Xianyi's place. His movements were measured and his speed was appropriate. He had the demeanor of a chemist. When demonstrating push hands, his hands would occasionally come together, with his fingertips pointing, which was very similar to the Buddha Hand logo of his product.</p>
<h3>Armless Woman</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>There is a woman in Valencia, Spain, named Magarita. Born without arms, she uses her feet instead of hands to work. Over time, things that ordinary people do with their hands, the woman can do skillfully with her toes. She is proficient in writing, calligraphy, needlework, and embroidery. She can use her toes to comb her hair and glue paper to make toys. Sometimes, between husband and wife, when emotions are high, she will use her toes to lightly pinch her husband's cheek to bring joy. Therefore, the name of the armless woman has spread throughout the country. Even President Zamora knows of her. He has now specially authorized the display of the woman's works in various provincial capitals of Spain.</p>
<p>When Magarita was seven years old, she could eat with her feet. She loved art. Later, she asked her parents for permission to study. Her parents refused because she was disabled and it would be inconvenient. However, she was eager to learn and studied diligently on her own. Gradually, she was able to hold a pen with her toes. And gradually, the work of her feet became like that of ordinary people's hands. The woman said that when she first started learning, she found it very difficult. Those who saw her laughed at her for being foolish. However, she did not lose heart. She practiced hard behind closed doors, and gradually became proficient. To this day, she can finally do things with her feet as she wishes. The woman eventually gained a lover because of her many talents. After marriage, the couple was very affectionate. They have a son who is ten years old, with all four limbs intact, and is healthy and intelligent. Now, the clothes of the whole family are made by the woman's ten toes. When she has free time, she also does embroidery and fine work. This is what the woman is proud of.</p>
<p>A Spaniard once praised the woman's skills to a friend in France. The friend dismissed it as a lie. They argued for a long time. The friend said, "I am willing to bet a thousand francs. If the woman can work in front of me as you described, I will lose a thousand francs. Otherwise, you will have to empty your purse." The agreement was made, and they sent someone to welcome the woman with travel expenses. The woman readily agreed. When she arrived, she demonstrated her skills in front of the Frenchman. Her dexterity was as if it came from her hands. The Frenchman was amazed and threw the money on the table, saying, "There are indeed extraordinary people in the world. If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would never have believed it." The man then gave the winnings to the woman and also provided her return travel expenses. Alas, such a woman is truly enough to shame those who have all their limbs but abandon their studies. It is fitting that she is respected by the President.</p>
<h3>The Gun and the Pen</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>I am editing the "Coral Semi-Monthly" magazine and solicited articles from Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing. Mr. Cheng readily agreed to help by writing a Hawthorne detective story called "Eighty-Four," which is intricate and detailed, and there is no need to say more. But I was particularly moved when he introduced me to the "Resistance Diary" of Battalion Commander Deng. Battalion Commander Deng defended Wusong for four weeks and was wounded in the most intense fighting. He was treated at the Bo Doxi Hospital in Suzhou. Mr. Cheng went to visit him and became friends. After that, they had frequent contacts. The diary starts from January 28th and ends when he was wounded. It describes the work of defending Wusong and the situation of the arduous defense for more than twenty days in great detail. Its value is different from the records of imaginary fabrications and groundless rumors. Recently, Battalion Commander Deng has gone to Fujian. Before leaving, he sent a letter to Mr. Cheng, saying, "If I have any special gains in the future, I will still write to you." Mr. Cheng once encouraged him to "work hard for another two years." Therefore, he replied, "I don't know what the situation of the country will be like in two years." At the end of the letter, a spirit of passionate loyalty is revealed between the lines. He said, "The ancients said, 'A great husband vows to serve the country, and life and death are not worth discussing.' I am determined to take advantage of this energetic and strong year to work hard for the benefit of the country and the people, to be a pillar of strength in the national salvation army. Success or failure is not what I care about." It is inspiring to read. It is difficult for someone who carries a gun to also be able to carry a pen. It is difficult for someone who carries a pen to befriend someone who carries a gun. It is difficult for someone who carries a gun to be willing to enthusiastically help someone who carries a pen.</p>
<h3>On Thrift and Frugality to Save the Nation (13)</h3>
<p>— Related by Nie Huiji Fen Shunan Qijie, Written by [Qijie]</p>
<p>Addendum Two: Pan Yinge, Director of the Kunshan Education Bureau, went to Japan two years ago to investigate education. Upon his return, he wrote an article saying that the virtue of diligence, thrift, and hardship in Japan is closely related to religion. The people of the country are all influenced by Buddhism and are content with frugality due to religious doctrines. Mr. Pan can be said to be good at observing national conditions. According to the Japanese Ministry of Education's registration last year, there were more than 41 million Buddhists in the country, accounting for about seven or eight out of ten people. Many of the heroes of the Restoration were Yangming scholars and also Zen scholars. Japanese scholar Kuki Shūzō wrote a book called "Yangming and Zen," saying that Yangming is Zen and Zen is Yangming, with very detailed citations. This book has been translated and printed by Liu Jun Renhang, but the printing plates are now missing. The religious doctrine of being content with frugality can make a country rich and strong. Both spirit and matter are related. This article has briefly described this, but there is one more important meaning that needs to be explained, that is, being content with frugality prevents one from exhausting one's mind with various material desires and allows one to concentrate on learning and work. Zeng Wenzheng said, "One's spirit should be abundant in order to deal with matters." These words are worth pondering. Today, the situation is difficult and dangerous. Internal affairs, diplomacy, education, and military affairs are all in a state of disrepair. Even if those in charge do their best to deal with them, they are still worried that it will not be enough. If they are further burdened by the management of private property and the distractions of hobbies, not to mention their corrupt actions, it goes without saying that public affairs will be perfunctory and neglected. Confucius said, "Few have failed through frugality." Frugality necessarily means few desires, so one's mental energy is often abundant and one does not worry about exhausting it when dealing with matters. The so-called "using one's will without distraction" is to concentrate one's spirit. This is the profound meaning of Confucianism's emphasis on frugality and thrift. The Buddhist system even prohibits the accumulation of private property. Apart from the three robes made of rags, there is nothing else. The idea is to be as simple and unadulterated as possible. The Japanese are good at upholding this principle, so their spirit is abundant and they can vigorously promote and improve themselves. Is this not something that our people should be ashamed of and strive to emulate? (End)</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Current Affairs</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Those who invade us are our enemies. But if we become stronger and more prosperous because of the invasion, then those who invade us will instead become our formidable friends. We often see people in love committing suicide because of heartbreak, but we have never seen people in politics committing suicide because of losing territory.</p>
<p>Chinese politics is like Chinese drama, focusing only on one plot, so it can never produce a good show that everyone masters.</p>
<p>High-ranking officials resign, and workers go on strike. Although the classes are different, the dissatisfaction with the current life is the same. Implementing "returning to the countryside after retirement" is a thorough awakening, because only farmers are the loyal sons of the motherland, and only farmers are devoted to the foundation of the country.</p>
<p>I say that the national character of Russia is great, the national character of Germany is profound, the national character of the United States is intelligent, the national character of Japan is treacherous, and the national character of China is decadent.</p>
<p>The military officers out of office are warning of "armed resistance," but they are "unable to resist." The military officers in office are "able to resist," but they are "unwilling to resist," so it has come to the point where we have lost territory and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Our officials and people across the country are all shouting "there is no way," so our country is forever trapped in a state of "no way."</p>

<h3>A Record of Living Between War and Home (80)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Powerful Men Abuse the Law, But Fortunately There Are Women to Console; Taking Shortcuts and Bribing to Achieve Success; Appointing Generals and Offering Amnesty to Bandits</p>
<p>An Yutian stuck out his tongue. He had gained more insight today, learning how difficult it is to meet warlords and how powerful their aides are. He fled back to the hotel. When he paid the taxi fare, he found that because the taxi had waited for six hours, he had lost eighteen yuan for nothing. It was no more than spending money to suffer. By midnight, Liang Xiaoyun had also returned. An Yutian had already had a good meal and slept for a while, and his strength had recovered. He then hesitantly reported the matter roughly. Liang Xiaoyun was shocked and said, "Why didn't you listen to me again and added trouble for me?" An Yutian hurriedly defended himself, "You have to forgive me for this. Think about it, I want to be an official here. In the future, when I go in and out of the government office, I can't always rely on my wife. Others will look down on me. That's why I tried it alone. But I didn't expect it to turn out so badly. I can only blame my bad luck and my lack of ability. I don't deserve to be this official. I have let you down. I think you don't have to blame me anymore. Just consider that you recognized the wrong person and promoted a Liu Adou who can't be supported. You should cancel this extravagant hope as soon as possible and return to Beijing together. Find something that I can easily do. I would be willing to be a doorman for you." In his words, hundreds of emotions were intertwined, and all the grievances he had suffered recently came to his heart. He couldn't help but shed a few tears of a hero. Liang Xiaoyun was initially unhappy when she heard him complaining, but when she saw him crying sadly, like a poor little insect, she thought that men's tears are not shed lightly. Unlike women, who cry as a matter of course, he would not be forced to this point unless he had really suffered great grievances. Their emotions were running high and they were deeply connected. Her heart immediately softened and she wanted to be especially kind to him. She pulled him to a large armchair and made him lie down. She sat sideways on the edge of the chair and personally took out a small silk handkerchief to gently wipe away the tears from the corners of his eyes. She put on a flower-like smile and pressed half of her rosy cheek against his tense cheek, saying in a very affectionate and gentle voice, "Yutian, what's wrong with you? I just said that this matter had a small problem that needed to be remedied. Did you misunderstand that I was blaming you? I am not an unreasonable person. I know very well the difficulties of the world. A pure and proud young man like you, coming to this strange environment for the first time, will naturally have many unfamiliar things and many things that you are not used to, which will make you feel unusually frustrated and infinitely painful."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Reaction: A Vigorous Advance to 12.5 Taels</h3>
<p>Private Forward Trading: Shorts Forced to Cover - Yesterday, the gold price rebounded strongly, recovering from three days of declines. The progression was gradual, eventually turning into a vigorous advance with limited retracement. Throughout the day, there were moments when it retreated to eleven taels, but it subsequently rebounded to over twelve taels. Initially, the rise was attributed to the stability of the silver market and a slight tightening of exchange rates. Subsequently, buyers became emboldened, and with foreign exchange also tightening, the momentum increased, surpassing the significant 730 tael mark. However, fluctuations were limited to one or two taels. Initially, the market seemed poised for a decline, but as forward premiums widened, shorts hastily covered their positions, boosting buying interest and sending prices soaring to 735-36 taels at the close. However, due to a lack of demand for Wednesday's drafts, trading in July-August forwards began a day early in the afternoon. Shorts offered the premium, initially around six taels. However, as more longs were willing to offer, this was suppressed, settling at only around 4.5 taels, before widening again to around five taels. After 3:00 PM, bullish forces dug in, causing shorts to become anxious and increase their offers to close. It is said that the Dalian group, Yifeng, Yongqian, and Changxiang were largely long, while Hengxing initially entered long but later exited, and Runchang and Yu were short. Eventually, the premium rose to 7 taels, 2-3 qian. Some were even trading based on today's listing price or adding one or two qian. Nonetheless, those who traded in advance yesterday were still numerous. The market's changes are truly unpredictable. A detailed record of the day's events is provided below.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Sees Immediate Gains, Momentum Increases - From the early 7th month opening, the price immediately added 2.5 taels, reaching 725 taels. Although the silver market remained unchanged, expectations of a rise had been building the previous night, and the forward silver price was lower, plus the private telegrams were down by 1/8, strengthening confidence. Hengyu and Dadecheng were the first to enter, driving the price up to 27.5 taels. Tongtaichang sold goods, pushing the price down slightly by one tael, zero, to 26 taels, 2 qian. Subsequently, Yuanmaoshui, Yuhe, Hongkangyong, Hengyu, Yuantai, and Yifengyong all entered, and HSBC absorbed 180,625 pounds of July English gold. The Belgian Bank also entered, while Maccari and He did a deal for October American gold at 1875, causing the price to jump three taels to 29 taels at 9:30 AM. The posted English gold suddenly changed, and American gold decreased by 125, tightening the exchange rates. At this time, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, and Zhifengyong all entered at 30.5 taels. Before long, the Dalian group sold, pushing the price back to 29 taels, 3 qian, but it quickly rebounded by two taels. Sanjing absorbed 31 yuan of September [gold], Mack Row absorbed 625 of July [gold], and Xiexingyong, Tianfengyong, Zhifengyong, and Futaiheng all entered, reaching 31 taels, 2 qian at 9:40 AM. Small short positions hurriedly covered, while Tongtaichang, Yifeng, Yuanmaoyong, and Shunli sold, and Shanghai Bank sold September American gold at 31 yuan, 0.0625, and English gold was dealt at 1875, causing the market to falter slightly, retreating more than two taels to 28 taels, 6 qian at 10:30 AM. Fluctuations were minimal, only three or four qian. Later, as the exchange market stabilized and goods were hedged, buying increased, but the various houses' settlement practices differed, so the price sometimes rose or fell by one tael until it improved by one tael, zero, at 11:30 AM, reaching 30 taels, 2 qian at 11:45 AM. Later, the Dalian group and Dadecheng disposed of holdings, suppressing the price by one tael to 29 taels, 2 qian, before closing at 29.5 taels. The listed price was changed to 797 taels, a premium of 68 taels to 66-67 taels.</p>
<p>The Evening Closes at a High of 36 Taels - The after-market opened at 28 taels, 7 qian, then went from 8 taels, 3 qian to 9 taels. Private forward trading began, but prices were not high, so the market price retreated to 27 taels, 7 qian. After 2:30 PM, buying activity increased, with Hongkangyong, Dadecheng, Wupin, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, etc., all eagerly entering, as many longs refused to offer forwards, so shorts eagerly bought, causing the market price to rise further. By 1:30 PM, it had broken through 30 taels, reaching 33 taels, 6 qian at 4:00 PM, before retreating slightly by one tael. Subsequently, Zhifengyong and Yuanmaoyong continued to aggressively buy, raising the forward premium to more than 7 taels, so at 4:20 PM, the price suddenly reached 36 taels. At this time, Yifeng came to sell over 200 bars, offering a discount of one tael, zero, at 24 taels, 8 qian. The market closed at 4:30 PM at 35 taels, up 12 taels, 5 qian from the previous day. The daily high was 36 taels and the low was 25 taels, a difference of 11 taels. The listing price had premiums of 6389 taels to 612 taels, so there was a double closing price. The front market was 10 taels and the back market was 35 taels. The replenishment water was 30 taels to 35 taels, and the bare bar was increased by 8 taels, 25.</p>
<p>Buying Dominated Counter Trading - Statistics show that Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Xiexingyong, Futaiheng, Yuantai, Yifengyong, Yiyu, and Hengchangyong were all long, while Shunli, Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Hengxing, Yifeng, Qianchangxiang, and Yuanmaoyong were all short. Wanxing, Yuandayong, Hongkangyong, and Yuhe had mixed positions. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Bingxing, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, and retail shorts were all long, while Yuantai, Yifeng, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, and Shunli were all short. The Dalian group sold a total of over 800 bars and bought 100-200 bars. The Guang Gang's settlement practices differed, but the numbers were not large, it is said.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Tightens</h3>
<p>English and American Exchanges Tighten - Forward premiums seem to have narrowed slightly - Yesterday, the silver market did not change. Exchange rates tightened again, with HSBC's listing slightly changed, with American dollars reduced by 125 to 30 yuan, 125, Hong Kong dollars reduced by 125 to 77 taels, 375, French francs decreased by 3 yuan, German exchange decreased by half a yuan, and the Japanese yen decreased by half a shield. Others, such as English, Indian, and Singaporean dollars, did not change. After the domestic market initially stabilized, the gold price suddenly soared, breaking through 730 taels. Compared to the previous night's close, English gold was reduced by 0.0625 and American dollars by 0.25, reflecting the trend of tightening English and American exchanges. Bank transactions were normal, with 30,000-40,000 pounds of English gold traded, with various houses slightly selling. Another 300,000-400,000 American dollars were traded, initially offered and then bought back, and the July-October spread was offered at 0.05625 and the August-October spread at 0.0375, offered by HSBC, totaling around several hundred thousand yuan. The market trended tighter. The afternoon saw no market due to Wednesday.</p>
<p>English Exchange - The domestic market only saw a rise or fall of 0.0625 in half a day. In the morning, the selling price was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 10.0625 to 1.875, and the buying price was 125 to 25. Zhejiang and HSBC mutually traded July at 0.0625, the Belgian bank absorbed 0.0625, and Sumitomo and Feng mutually traded September at 1.875.

<h3>Silver Market Turns Better</h3>
<p>Gradual Increase of 0.025 - Market Overview - The silver market has suddenly turned better in recent days. While there have been no particularly wild changes, the gradual increase is remarkable. According to the situation, due to the price of [gold] falling daily, silver furnaces are trying to pick up and absorb old coins such as English dollars and dragon dollars for melting, so the available silver in the market is slightly depleted. As the end of the accounting period has passed, the financial community is expanding, so the situation has improved.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Show Weakness Again</h3>
<p>Increased Forward Trading Compared to Before - Yesterday (15th), the transaction situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed that spot transactions only amounted to 22,000 yuan, including 10,000 yuan for salt tax and 7,000 yuan for 20 customs, with other individual items only reaching 1,000 yuan. The futures market was slightly more lively. Trading in the market was not quiet, and forward trading was also more active, with total transactions amounting to 4,022,500 yuan, including 790,000 for salt tax, 725,000 for 20 customs, 610,000 for consolidated tax, and 47-480,000 each for 1932 and 20 Customs. Others were around 300,000, while the remaining 1936, customs, and 1939 were sparsely traded. Regarding the trend of bond prices, as the overall situation has not made obvious developments and market sentiment is uncertain, the situation is chaotic. Prices have returned to weakness, with selling particularly active, causing prices to gradually decline. However, as demand and supply were relatively even, there were no major changes in the market before and after. As a result, compared to the previous day, futures for consolidated salt tax in both the current and next month fell by 6-7 jiao, while others fell by 0.2-0.3 jiao. Only a few types rose slightly compared to the previous day, it is said.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Up</h3>
<p>(US East Bank Company Report)</p>
<p>Tuesday's New York stock market saw a slight increase in activity compared to the previous day, and the market trended higher across the board. Although there was news that Adams Company and Western Union Telegraph Company preferred stock had suspended dividend payments, it had no impact on the market. The firmness of Tuesday's market was due to the expectation that the US Congress would end everything and close on Saturday. The rise in cotton and [gold] prices and the advance in the international US exchange rate all served to boost confidence. The presidential election has not yet had an impact, but it is believed that this will become an important driving force in shifting the current market trend. Tuesday's Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>
<p>June 13 - June 14 - Up/Down - 30 Industrials 48.11 49.00 Up 0.89 - 20 Railroads 16.43 16.83 Up 0.40 - 20 Utilities 18.12 18.59 Up 0.47 - Attached: US East Bank Company Shanghai Commercial Securities Index June 14 20.78 - June 15 20.42 Down 0.35 - Highest in 1931-32 28.66 (September 12, 1931) - Lowest in 1931-32 20.43 (June 15, 1932)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market Downturn Slightly Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is slightly firmer. Due to nine consecutive days of declines, market sentiment has improved, prompting some profit-takers to cover their short positions, so the situation is more stable, and some outsiders are inclined to go long because the base has narrowed. Compared to the high price, it has fallen by 12 taels, so the market is calm. However, the demand for spot yarn remains sluggish. Banditry is rampant, and the inland economy is exhausted. In addition, Japanese merchants are vigorously encroaching everywhere, and the sales of local yarn have been severely hit.</p>
<p>Human Label Short Covering is Slightly Eager - In the morning market, the human label opened with steady American cotton, but market sentiment was still weak, with each month falling by 3-4 qian. Large accounts bought in during the second and third sessions, and the price rebounded, with each month rising by 2, 5, and 7 qian. The afternoon market opened with a strong upward trend, rising by 4 and 5 qian. In the second and third sessions, the price fell again, with each month falling by 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 29,500 bales. The sales were 1,250 bales for Gengfeng, 750 bales for Changfeng, 600 bales for Tianlong, 850 bales for Dachang, and 500 bales for Xincheng. The purchases were 1,200 bales for Hengchang, 900 bales for Jifeng, 600 bales for Daji, and 650 bales for Tonghe. The closing prices for the human label are listed below.</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Up/Down - Accounts - October 1446 Up 550 - 6007 - July 1452 Up 418 - 350 - November 1444 344,000 - August 1446 433,450 - Total 1,889,000 - September 1444 642,550</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Sluggish, Prices Fall - Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 700 bales for the day, with fellow merchants buying 75 bales, and prices falling by 0.025. Customers from Wuhu bought 10 bales, Zhenjiang 5 bales, Ningbo 25 bales, Sichuan 200 bales, Guangdong 130 bales, Datong 5 bales, Haizhou 15 bales, Yunnan 120 bales, and Luzhou 10 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Major Decline, Minor Rebound</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned firm, which was expected after nine consecutive days of declines. This also prompted some profit-takers to close their positions, so the market became tight. However, the overall situation remains bleak. The Ningbo Exchange has reportedly suspended trading due to the recent sharp drop in prices. According to statistics, foreign cotton imports into Shanghai totaled over 3.8 million dan last year, while local cotton totaled just over 1 million dan. In the first four months of this year, foreign cotton imports totaled over 1.5 million dan. Based on the above observations, the huge volume of foreign cotton imports is unprecedented, and local cotton consumption has been largely taken over by foreign cotton. Therefore, under these circumstances, the future of the cotton market is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Zheng Label Profit Taking - The Zheng Label opened in the morning with American cotton rising for two consecutive days, leading to firm sentiment and short covering by retail investors. Each month rose by 4 and 6 qian. In the afternoon, the near months rose another 2 and 3 qian, and the far months fell by 0.015. The total trading volume for the day was 82,500 dan. The sales were 5,500 dan for Gengfeng, 1,700 dan for Zhenda, 1,600 dan for Yichang, 4,700 dan for Changfeng, 1,600 dan for Yuanda, and 1,800 dan for Yuanda. The purchases were 3,700 dan for Jifeng, 3,800 dan for Hengchang, 4,000 dan for Xincheng, and 1,200 dan for Tongxing. The closing prices for the Zheng Label are listed below.</p>
<p>Zheng Label Closing - Up/Down - Accounts - October 2870 Up 60 - 126,800 - July 2790 Up 90 - 56,400 - November 2910 - 55 - 130,000 - August 2820 - 60 - 97,400 - Total 410,600 - Spot Needs Pause - There are absolutely no spot cotton transactions, and various factories have also halted operations.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Resistant to Shorts, Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to foreign merchants buying, short covering, and increased buyers. Futures rose 2-4 points, spot rose 5 points, English cotton futures rose 6-7 points, spot rose 1 point, Egyptian cotton spot rose 15 points, and Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram record is on the left (14th telegram).

<h3>May American Cotton Statistical Report</h3>

<p>South Shanghai - Yesterday's rice market saw over 30 ships arriving from the west, and inventories in the river gradually increased. City and rural stores observed the accumulation of goods over days. In addition, foreign rice ships decreased, and reports stated that Anhui Province was opening its borders, making sentiment even weaker. Medium-grade thick japonica rice plummeted by 4 jiao, and the top speculators were unwilling to sell at low prices. Although thin rice arrived, dealers were selective and rarely sold. The medium-grade rice market was quiet, with prices falling by 3 jiao. Sales of foreign Lu Jian rice also weakened, and the market was extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>North Shanghai - Yesterday, the Xinzha rice market saw about 40 shipments from inland areas. There was a severe lack of visiting merchants in the morning. Changzhou, Xichang, and North japonica early rice, Feilaihong thin rice, etc., all fell by 0.2-0.3 jiao. Sales of Lu and foreign Jian rice also weakened, and the market was sluggish. Although there were not many goods under [the name of] Bian Yin Yuan, sales were slow. Foreign rice merchants were unable to sell, causing the price to weaken again.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Move After Decline</h3>
<p>Price Down 0.05-0.06 - Zhenjiang and Jiangbei Continue to Load Ships - Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw abundant inventories and sluggish sales. With the surge in Tu rice, the market price was poor. After the market opened in the morning, customers generally did not inquire, and even local merchants did not inquire. Only a few local merchants purchased 300-400 bags of miscellaneous small rice, and the price fell by 0.04-0.06. In the afternoon, customers from Jiangbei, Chongming, and Zhenjiang, considering the price to be reasonable, went to the market and purchased over 2,000 bags of miscellaneous small rice, slightly stabilizing the market. The Tong City sold 150 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice at 11 yuan, 6 jiao, and a half. Xiaojiao Baisheng rice was 300 bags, priced at 10 yuan, 0.4 jiao, and a half. Ordinary market Xiaojiao rice was 3,000 bags, priced at 10 yuan, 0.3-0.15 jiao. Min Dang rice was over 100 bags, priced at 10 yuan, 0.7 jiao, and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Morning Weakness, Afternoon Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month showed a weakening trend. Foreign wheat quotations remained low, and sales at Zhikan and both places continued to be about 0.03-0.05 lower. Due to financial issues, actual sales everywhere were difficult to develop, so sentiment was soft and opening prices eased. The closing price for July-August was 8 qian, 6 fen, 2.5 li, slightly lower by 0.01, while the remainder was also lower by 0.0075-0.005. When trading opened in the afternoon, it was still quiet, but due to rising wheat quotations, sentiment stabilized, and opening prices were slightly higher than in the morning. To observe the future, there must be strong actual sales for improvement, otherwise, holding on will be useless. Battleship spot is still quoted at 1 liang, 9 qian, and a half, red and blue car is 1 liang, 9 qian, 0.015, Fort 1 liang, 8 qian, 0.08, and the remainder follows the standard. As a result, July was slightly lower by 0.0075 compared to the previous day, August was lower by 0.0025, and the remainder saw no changes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Label Afternoon Sudden Rise</h3>
<p>Spot Wheat Arrives Strong, Prices Weaken - Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened in the morning with low foreign wheat quotations of 0.03-0.05. Transactions were sparse, and there were few inflows and outflows. Only July saw slight stability. However, when trading opened in the afternoon, it suddenly showed a strong upward trend, and transactions were brisk. It was heard that a Dingtai customer was progressively buying into July, August, and September, stimulating the market and bringing it to life. However, the Wuxi gang, due to the low price of spot wheat, also sold along with the trend, and the numbers were significant. Currently, only about 30% of spot wheat can be delivered to standard [grades], and the customer's interest may be for other purposes. As a result, July surged by 0.08 compared to the previous day, August rose by 0.06, September rose by 0.05, October rose by 0.07, and November rose by 0.04. Spot wheat arrivals are gradually increasing, but opening prices are low. Shuangfeng wheat with a 90% rating is quoted at only 2 liang, 8 qian, Penglai Anting wheat is quoted at 2 liang, 7 qian, and Wusong wheat is quoted at 2 liang, 6 qian, totaling 1,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Raw Sand and White Trend Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw few transactions at the Guild market, but market sentiment stabilized. The transaction price for Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sand white was 13 liang, 9 qian. Inflows and outflows were weak. Hong Kong goods were 13 liang, 7 qian, and transactions were brisk. The trend seems to have shifted from weakness to stability. Dutch red No. 9 was 9 liang, 9 qian, and the market was healthy. Taikoo sugar transactions remained sluggish. CW mark was 15 liang, 9 qian to 8 qian and a half, H mark was 12 liang, 4 qian, and the market was stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Market Situation Unfavorable</h3>
<p>The tea market in this port's foreign houses has been increasingly unfavorable in recent days. The market price of each grade of Zhenmei green tea has fallen by 50 taels. Chinese merchants are reluctantly selling at a loss. Various houses and merchants have also sent out large numbers of telegrams to promote sales due to the favorable tea prices. However, foreign tea merchants, given the rapid price declines in the Shanghai market, are keenly aware that Chinese tea merchants have weak resistance and are still determined to suppress prices to await the opportunity. Recently, only secondary goods such as needle eyebrow and show eyebrow have seen some transactions in the green tea market. The Zhenmei, which is worth 100 taels outside the pass, is almost completely stagnant. However, yesterday, due to English houses replenishing shortages, the Qimen black tea market saw slightly more activity, but the selling price also fell by 20-30 taels compared to before. The market situation is still difficult to be optimistic about, it is said.</p>
<h3>Drop in Price of Hardware Black Iron Nails by Over One or Two Taels</h3>
<p>The sales of black iron nails have been most brisk in the Three Eastern Provinces, Yantai, Tianjin, and along the Yangtze River. Recently, the Three Eastern Provinces have been affected by military affairs, resulting in no transactions. The Tianjin and Yangtze River factions have also been experiencing tight credit conditions, so there are no large-scale purchases. Therefore, the market is only slightly active in the Yantai area. Moreover, the recent moldy weather has significantly reduced outbound shipments, while incoming goods to this port continue to arrive in succession. As a result, supply exceeds demand, causing widespread panic, and standard asking prices have inevitably seen a drop. For example, three-fen nails are estimated at 43 taels per box, four-fen at 42 taels, five-fen at 41 taels and 7.5 qian, and six-fen at 42 taels, each down by one to one and a half taels compared to the previous market prices. It is said that trading remains sluggish.</p>
<h3>Drop in Price of New Iron Wire by 2.5 Qian</h3>
<p>The trading of new iron wire has been more active recently than before, but there is an abundance of goods on the market, and the sources of supply are numerous, leading to poor market sentiment. The standard price has dropped by 2.5 qian, with each dan selling for only 13 taels (for numbers 16 to 20). As for numbers 21 to 25, each dan is asking for 13 taels and 7.5 qian. Imports from Hankou, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and other areas are said to be moving, while sales from other areas appear sluggish.</p>
<h3>Over Eighty Tons of Pig Lead Traded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of significant activity in practical applications, the market for pig lead is very sluggish, and standard prices are quite weak. Yesterday, the Fujian faction suddenly purchased over eighty tons (approximately 1,400 dan), boosting market sentiment. The asking price was 13 taels and 2 qian per dan.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices: Quiet Weakness in Liujiang Coal Sales</h3>
<p>Sales of Liujiang white lump coal have been slow recently, and market prices are quietly weakening. The current selling price for first-grade goods is 15 taels and 2.5 qian per ton, and for second-grade goods (i.e., stinky coal) is 11 taels and 7.5 qian per ton. The market price of Hongqi lump coal has also fallen, with the current selling price being 19 taels and 7.5 qian per ton, a decrease of approximately one tael compared to before.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement, Republic of China, Year 21, June 16, Thursday (No additional charge)</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Mandarin</h3>
<p>— Luo Wengan Discusses Sino-Japanese Disputes. He said that the Shanghai issue is like cutting a finger, not a serious matter, while the Eastern Provinces issue is like lung disease, enough to control a person's life.</p>
<p>So, the Shanghai issue is just like cutting a finger, not a serious matter, we now understand. However, there are still some unworldly Chinese people making a fuss about the Shanghai issue. Originally, the psychology of the people of Jiangsu, or more broadly the psychology of the people of the South, was that the Northeast was originally Zhang's territory, and the central government had no way to fully control it, only to restrain it. Moreover, the Japanese said that the Eastern Provinces could be put into a bag at any time. Now, with the relationship with Soviet Russia, there is an inevitable sudden turn of events. Shanghai is a major trading port between China and foreign countries, with very close ties to our country. Today, I would like to tell the people of the country not to worry and not to make trouble. Foreign Minister Luo said that the Shanghai issue is like cutting a finger, not a serious matter.</p>
<p>He also said, "I went to Shanghai a few days ago to inspect, and the scars of January 28th are still there, but the emotions of the people are almost the same as before the incident. Such forgetfulness is chilling." (This is indeed true.) We handle diplomacy with the interests of the country and the people as the premise, but before diplomatic policies are mature, there are often things that must be kept secret. Once leaked, all previous efforts will be wasted.</p>
<p>Diplomatic issues do require secrecy, but this kind of strictly confidential part mostly belongs to the beneficial aspects of our country. If humiliating diplomacy and diplomacy that loses rights and humiliates the country are also kept secret in the same way, once a big mistake is made, the people will be unable to save it even if they shout themselves hoarse. I am here again to tell the people of the country to listen to Foreign Minister Luo and to be silent and watch, and not to destroy his achievements that will waste all previous efforts.</p>
<p>He also said that the people of the country should always keep the Northeast in mind. His meaning is as if to say, "You don't have to think about Shanghai, think about the Northeast." Alas, our poor people, thinking about it is the same as not thinking about it. Moreover, to think about the Northeast, the government must first think about it. How can ordinary people with no weapons think about it? Now that there is a government that takes the interests of the people as the premise, ordinary people can naturally not think about it. If they do think about it, I am afraid that it will destroy its achievements that will waste all previous efforts. And I know very well what the government is thinking about. In the January 28th Incident, it greatly emphasized long-term resistance; in the September 18th Incident, it greatly emphasized the punishment of the puppet state and the recovery of lost territory. The government is always thinking about it, so what is there for the ordinary people to think about?</p>
<p>Arts and Literature</p>
<h3>Four Poems of Lament for the Northeast (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shaozhu</p>
<p>Lament for Longjiang: The Ezo have already broken Ang'angxi, and the celebratory songs fly all the way. The black clouds crossing the river are larger than horses, and in half a day, they have covered Longjiang. The Longjiang general is brave and unparalleled, and the enemy soldiers fear him like a god. After several great victories in consecutive days of fierce fighting, his strength is exhausted, and he collapses due to the lack of reinforcements. The isolated city is impregnable, and the officials and people all persuade the general to leave. The people love the general like a father and brother and cannot bear to throw the entire city as a desperate gamble. The general has left, and the bandits have entered the city. On horseback, only the sound of weeping is heard. Alas, the general's retreat is not out of choice. He will recover the bandit forts as early as next spring.</p>
<h3>Lament for Jinzhou</h3>
<p>The sound of rushing carriages can be heard all night long. Our army is heading into the pass. The high city of Jinzhou is only a foot and a half from the sky. How can it be allowed to have a city and not defend it? The barbarian flute is played on the city at dusk. The bandits ascend the walls without shedding blood. Who is intercepting and killing in the city? The righteous people of Western Liaoning, the children of the border city, bravely rush in without fear of death, and their arrows and famous city share the end. Their wounds penetrate to the bone, and they fall and rise again. Even when they die, they still grit their teeth. Tomorrow, the Ezo will slaughter the four gates, and rumors are spreading about chickens and pigs. Alas, our people are not weak in killing bandits. What can be done when the three armies retreat first? The key to the north gate is now wide open, and the bandit army is watering their horses at the Great Wall.</p>

<h3>Radio Broadcasting and Receiving</h3>
<p>— Zhuzhong</p>
<p>"How can sound be transmitted when there are no wires connecting the two places?" This is a question I often hear. To understand this question, we must first understand that "the reason why wired telephones can transmit sound is not because our language can circulate on the wires; only current can pass on the wires." Therefore, telephones have two functions:</p>
<p>(1) To convert sound into current;</p>
<p>(2) To convert current into sound.</p>
<p>Our language is converted into current by the A telephone, transmitted to the B telephone through the wire. The B telephone converts this current into sound, restoring our language and reaching the ears of the listener. In this way, A and B can talk to each other.</p>
<p>Wired telephones are very simple and can serve both sending and receiving functions. Wireless telephones are more complex, and the sound-emitting and sound-receiving machines must be set up separately. The sound-emitting machine is called a "broadcasting machine," and the sound-receiving machine is called a "receiving machine." Both broadcasting machines and receiving machines are equipped with "antennas." The antenna is made of varnished or tinned red copper wire twisted into a thin rope and erected in the outdoor air with tall posts.</p>
<p>The earphones on a telephone have two ends: one end is for speaking, and the other end is for listening. Therefore, broadcasting machines must have specially made "transmitters," and receiving machines must have specially made listening devices. There are two types of listening devices: one is "earphones," which are worn on the ears to listen to, and the other is "loudspeakers," which allow everyone to listen together.</p>
<p>When we speak or play music into the transmitter of a broadcasting machine, the broadcasting machine converts the sound waves into electromagnetic waves. These electromagnetic waves are broadcast into the air by the antenna and transmitted in all directions by the ether (note) in the air. The greater the power of the broadcasting machine, the farther the broadcast distance. Within the area that these electromagnetic waves can reach, if there is a receiving machine, the antenna of the receiving machine can receive these electromagnetic waves, and the receiving machine converts the electromagnetic waves into sound waves, which are released by the loudspeaker or earphones. We can then hear the music or famous people's speeches broadcast by the broadcasting station.</p>
<p>(Note) Scientists believe that there must be a medium for the transmission of "heat," "light," and "electricity," and that this medium must be very thin and very tough, permeating the universe and filling all things. For the sake of convenience, scientists have named it "ether." In fact, this thing is still an ideal and has not been seen by scientists. Scientists have spent a lot of time and effort, but they have not yet swept away this dark cloud in science.</p>
<p>A Corner of Social Chatter</p>
<h3>The Secret History of the Bottle Palace</h3>
<p>— Shiban</p>
<p>The other day, I was strolling on the road when I saw a person in tattered clothes standing on the edge of a cement step, holding a few silk round ropes in his hand. At the end of each rope, there was a bottomless broken medicine bottle. He stood there, playing with it while shouting, "Two copper coins to take a look." I found it strange in my heart, thinking, what is there to see in a broken medicine bottle? Thinking this way, my feet involuntarily stopped. After a short while, I saw a few young brothers running over, vying to take the broken bottle from the person's hand, holding it up to their eyes like they were looking through a telescope. Four or five broken bottles, eight or nine viewers, so that the supply did not meet demand. In less than an hour, the children's money was earned by the person. After these young viewers had appreciated the broken bottles, their small faces all showed a look of great joy, and they kept shouting, "Oh, it's so beautiful, interesting, a man and a woman..." Seeing this situation and hearing these words, I was really confused. I thought, a broken little bottle, when you look into it it's empty, so what is there to see? If there aren't any tricks inside, how could it attract these young compatriots to be so happy? Oh! Wasn't I hearing them say a man and a woman? Could there be some secret inside? For a moment, I really couldn't find an answer.</p>
<p>Later, I ran into Mr. ××× next door, who is a playboy in Shanghai, knowing everything strange and being proficient in everything. I told him about the trick above, and he said that now there are some people who rack their brains to come up with this peep show using a bottle bottom. Its construction is to use a picture from a pornographic album, cover it with a small piece of thick glass, stick it to the opening of the bottle, knock off the bottom of the bottle, and tie it with a rope, scamming the copper coins from the children on the road. Alas! After hearing his words, I suddenly understood. No wonder the attraction is so strong. It turns out they are looking at secret erotic pictures. Alas! This kind of trick is harmful to public morals. Children's knowledge is not yet developed, and they are being tempted in this way. In their small minds, they are receiving a huge evil lesson. The harm is really not small.</p>

<h3>Itinerant Medicine Men</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>One day, on a hot summer noon, two uninvited guests walked into the door.</p>
<p>The first to walk in was wearing a Xiangyun gauze long gown. Following behind was a person in a "kima suit" and a "Napoleon hat," resembling a "know-it-all."</p>
<p>"Is there anyone unwell here?" the person in the Xiangyun gauze long gown abruptly asked.</p>
<p>"What unwell?" I didn't understand.</p>
<p>"Is anyone not feeling well?"</p>
<p>"…What?…"</p>
<p>"Not well?"</p>
<p>"…………?"</p>
<p>Finally, the person in the Xiangyun gauze long gown closed his mouth and let the person in the "kima suit" speak.</p>
<p>"Are there any sick people here?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Oh! But Shanghai has gone through this war in Zhabei, and infectious diseases are bound to be very prevalent in the future. It is difficult to guarantee that no one in your family will be infected. So you should get two preventative shots now!"</p>
<p>"Thank you. We plan to get them in a few days!" I thought they must be investigators from the Public Works Department's health department.</p>
<p>"Ah! That won't do. Didn't you see in the newspaper that there are many cases of cholera in the affected area?... I think it's better to get the shots a few days earlier! I've already brought the needles, can you get the shots right now?"</p>
<p>"Does it cost money?"</p>
<p>"We'll talk about payment after the shot, we have a limit!" I finally understood their intention. They were what people call "itinerant medicine men."</p>
<p>"Our doctor is a Huachi (American) returned student!" The person in the Xiangyun gauze long gown interjected, "He also passed through Russia, England, and France when he came back. All the foreigners were cured by him by the thousands! Whoever he treats only needs to be seen once, never twice, haha, it's all 'one dose and peace'."</p>
<p>I secretly laughed. How could someone returning from America pass through Russia, England, and France? The people who take his medicine are probably "sent to their final journey," without even a second chance...".</p>
<p>Numerous words were exchanged for several "Oh, oh...no, no!"</p>
<p>With no other recourse, they had to leave.</p>
<p>After a while, I casually stuck my head out of the door and suddenly saw the two of them coming out from behind Aunt Xiang's house. Then, Aunt Xiang's back door made an ear-piercing sound, "Bang!"</p>
<p>Random Chatter</p>
<h3>In a Mosquito-Infested Night</h3>
<p>— Sensen</p>
<p>A few nights ago, at the time when late spring and early summer meet, the temperature suddenly increased. In the tiny shared room where B and S lived, the mosquitoes and insects that had been dormant all year began to move. When B fell asleep, they launched an invasion. "Ouch! Ouch! Mosquitoes!" B shouted for help after being bitten. "Hmph!" S indifferently replied, "The mosquitoes are sucking your blood, it has nothing to do with me, why make such a fuss and ruin people's sweet dreams?" He grumbled in his heart, and at the same time, he turned over and looked at B. Poor B had already been conquered by the mosquitoes and was drowsily asleep. His face, arms, and thighs were covered with mosquitoes, sucking blood at will. There were still a few small parts of his toes twitching, indicating resistance, but it was no longer possible to reverse the situation. S heard and witnessed his companion being harmed, but he didn't care to save him. He heartlessly closed his eyes and continued his sweet dreams.</p>
<p>The buzzing mosquitoes divided into teams and unexpectedly raided S's face. The clever S woke up with a start and hurriedly used the book he had placed beside his pillow to fight back against the mosquitoes. The cunning little insects used a feint to separate their resistance and disrupt them for a short time, then they retreated automatically and flew triumphantly to the opposite bed, striving to overcome their target. At this time, S couldn't bear to watch B being ravaged any longer. He thought to himself, "These inhumane insects are going to bite me after sucking his blood. I can't sleep peacefully unless I resolutely drive out the thugs." He jumped up, woke B up, opened the window, and thoroughly cleaned the room. At the same time, they either chased or killed the mosquitoes, giving them no place to stand. They fled through the door, and the two of them tightly closed the window before they could each sleep peacefully.</p>
