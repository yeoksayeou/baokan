<p>時評</p>
<h3>最近日俄間之濃雲密雨彬</h3>
<p>去年九一八日本之突然實力發强佔我東北一方面固爲资本主義國家迫於第三時期之恐慌。企圖挽救末刦。而必然的新競奪市塲。分割殖民地之第一聲。另一方面亦即爲資本主義國家準備實力發動。對付社會主義國家之蘇聯。而遠東佈置戰塲之第一幕。故東北禍變之發生日本固爲其主角。但實則其幕後尚大有人在觀乎去年六月二十四日日陸軍三長官討論增加駐屯台灣及朝鮮問題時南陸相［際此時會増加朝鮮駐軍各國所感亦必與前不同］之宣示以及金谷參謀長［現在我國防作戰以大陸作戰爲基本］之宣言弦外之音不言共喻。其幕後之秘戲吾人蓋可瞭然窺見也。</p>
<p>蘇聯於九一八禍變之眞實意義自無不明晰獨是彼目前正努力於五年經濟計劃之完成。社會主義經濟基礎之鞏固事實上絶不容引起戰綫擴大之戰爭故一再鄭重聲明其對於東北事件之中立態度極力避免與日發生衝突雖至日軍横斷中東路進佔哈爾濱亦默然無所表示僅聲明日軍須不危害其在北滿之權益此種鎭靜沉默態度之爲一種不得已之隠忍。爲一種應付環境之退守策略。蓋亦任何人所可灼知者也。然而蘇聯之退讓政策。自目前事實觀之。則顯然已漸趨於失敗。近數月來。日蘇間之關係。乃突形惡化。白俄在北滿中東路一帶之活躍。且幾乎公然與滿洲僞國之警察行動一致其背後顯然所有憑藉而其企圖則更顯然爲欲在蘇聯之東角。建立一顯似［滿洲僞國］之政權以爲軍之缓衝地甚且爲國聯處理滬案更感棘手</p>
<p>中國希冀國聯援助必致失望</p>
<p>日方宣傳退出國聯將成事實歐洲有遠慮觀察家表示意見</p>
<p>各方視綫羣集於史汀生一人</p>
<p>國民社二十二日日内瓦電云國聯大會十九國委員會主席希孟·及英外相西門·法代表彭古等前勸日代表長岡出席該會公開會議後長岡曾向本國政府請訓頃聞日代表團已接東京回訓因委員會内小國態度不利於日本决定不出席甚致聲稱日本不承認十九國委員會因此國聯對於上海問題之處理更感棘手此項僵局恐一時尚不易打開云</p>
<p>路透社二十三日倫敦電云中日爲上海退兵日期一事相互糾缠且無早了之象歐洲因此大爲不安今消息最靈通者似皆以爲十九國特委會已自陷於虚弱之地位在道德上或屬正當然其結果似將爲日本退出國聯使國聯無法實行其命令中國冀國聯或可援其得登彼岸此種希望必須打销又日本之態度非中國準備遏止抗日運動亦難望稍轉温和云有遠慮之觀察家表示意見以爲今眞正之危險實在滿洲中日衝突之消息近在歐洲雖已遠不僉前之重視然恐滿洲日軍事當局或將秘密煽動滿洲新政府出兵攻撃北平也此間且覺他日李頓調查團報告傳出時日本與國聯間必起卑鄙之齟齬至於日内瓦方面刻仍在殫思竭慮以求打破目下之僵局日代表長岡希望於今日午後接得日政府之新訓令果爾則十九國特委會尚可於星期一日集議也長岡現仍盡力覓取新方案惟東京原來之訓令仍藏諸其衣袋中蓋恐正式發表後將大碍和平解决之可能也東京新訓令遲遲未到當係日政府現正與外相芳澤商榷須俟商妥後再以訓令致長岡也</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電云外相芳澤對日内瓦日代表長岡發出無出席十九國委員會之必要之回電後與加入國聯之小國方面難免發生正面衝突故於五月所召集之國聯總會與日本之地位非常不利在國聯總會不但處理上海問題且欲引用國聯規約第十五條處理滿洲問題據三月十一日之决議適用第十五條第四項即纷爭不能解决時國聯理事會根據全體一致或過半數之表决述該纷爭之事實作製記載認爲公正且適當之勸告之報告而公布之云云故或將對日發出勸告　日本設接此勸告書則外務省决將命日代表退出國聯日本退出國聯或恐將見諸事實也</p>
<p>日聯社二十三日東京電云十九國委員會之决議問題日本與委員會意見未見一致外務省爲預先决定日本最後態度起見本日特與陸海軍當局作長時間之會議結果未達具體决定然大體意見主張（一）以大多數决定日軍撤退事宜絕對反對（二）混合委員會關於上海事件之權限於報告國聯或以大多數决定關於撤兵時期之意見提交國聯此種程度或有讓步餘地</p>
<p>路透社二十二日日内瓦電云今日美國務卿史汀生與特委會主席希孟晤談逾一小時後雙方皆未對外發言故談話内容無人知之美人方面謂史汀生傼傾聽希孟之言論而已他方面謂史汀生來游日内瓦主要目的之一在銷釋日内瓦與華盛頓問關於遠東問題之誤會又有人謂史汀生今晨運用其勢力主張更有力之政策但此說非出自官塲亦未經證實</p>

<p>表示自衛軍抗日决心</p>
<p>（北平）東鐵護路軍總司令丁超吉林自衛軍總司令李杜日前電致國聯調查團報告書陳述自九一八以來日軍在東北之暴行極爲詳盡内分六點如左</p>
<p>（一）吉林自衛軍之組織日軍旣佔錦州東北最後之壁壘已失僅有吉林省政府統治下之賓縣等二十八縣爲一塊乾凈土需哈爾濱一埠爲三省北部重心日欲取之乃嗾使熙洽等出兵於一月十六日攻榆樹等縣張作舟馮占海各部力與敵抗同日土肥原赴哈任日方特務機關長秘謀北侵時馮占海軍因不敵於二十五自阿城繞道至哈東二十六晨攻入哈埠杜部馬團同時開到二十七日與于深澂部在距哈十五里之上號交戰于軍敗潰阿城同時日機二架飛哈向二十六旅部投三彈被騎兵擊落一架超等職責所在必作正當之防衛杜所率二十四旅超所率二十八旅與二十二旅旅長趙毅二十五旅長穆憲章二十六旅長宋文俊二十九旅長王瑞華暫編第一旅長馮占海騎兵長宫長海成立吉林自衛軍推杜爲自衛軍總司令超爲東鐵護路軍總司令同時合超杜所部組織聯合軍設總部於賓縣遂於一月三十一日電告中外說明護路抗日衛國衛民之宗旨</p>
<p>（二）日軍破壞東鐵與我軍防衛之情形</p>
<p>日軍爲進佔哈埠謀假道東鐵爲東鐵所拒日軍取直接行動於一月二十八日强佔東鐵寛城子站搶殺路工扣留車輛貨物强迫路員開車輸送軍隊晚九時日軍鐵甲車兩列載滿日兵離長赴哈</p>
<p>佔領　門以南各站我軍爲護路計遂採取正當防衛自一月二十六日起至二月四日止與敵激戰於雙城堡三間堡一帶直至五日日空軍復來掩護陸軍前進投彈多至數百我軍遭受轟炸損害重大日軍長谷旅團多門師團仍繼續攻擊我軍因慮中外僑民生命財産退出哈埠至四時四十分日軍入據哈埠車站超等率部分退賓縣阿城依蘭等處徐圖規復失地</p>
<p>（三）義軍與自衛軍協力抗日超等撤退後日方復於二月十八十九等日由長春派出日機六架轟炸賓縣自衛軍總部因移方正時日軍迫同熙洽軍四出攻撃自衛軍民衆憤激義軍王德林部首先加入我軍二十日與日軍在延吉敦化激戰超等率部收復東鐵哈绥綫廿二日克烏密河進展至一面坡廿四日佔葦沙河二十六日杜復率部向哈推進時日方正醖釀僞組織恐爲擊破又派天野旅團開向一面坡一帶超等不得前進痛剿三月一日王德林部襲寗安海林擊敗日軍三月二十一日超等率部擊破熙洽日軍圍攻下城子時各地義軍來投聲勢大振、乃日軍欲消滅我國實力掩中外耳目又由賓縣珠河兩路猛進、我軍復作正當防衛自三月二十六至四月三日止以全力抵抗將日軍擊退、日復以飛機二十架、掩護作戰、並在方正依蘭各縣各村鎭轟炸、投擲重二百五十磅之炸彈多枚炸斃多人、損失極重、本軍總部因由方正移依蘭、四月五六七等日日機又飛依蘭轟炸、我方損失尤重</p>
<p>（四）暴力下之僞組織</p>
<p>日本鐵騎縱横、其目的在樹立新政權、與中國脫離關係以實行其併呑之步驟、三月九日、日人擺布就緒代漙儀發表荒謬宣言、關於僞國之組織及人員之指定、均係日人之僞造與强制、漙儀乃前清皇帝、中國革命時已自行退位、日本困願藉漙儀以掩世界之耳目、爲其完全呑併東三省之準備行爲、絕對不能以民族自决、欺騙國際、當漙儀在長春就職之日、各地民衆、皆有反對表示、三月十日、吉林各法團、即通電否認僞國、又本莊於返瀋途中、復遭便衣隊三百人之襲擊、此種日本人之所謂匪實即憤日本侵略、拚其生命以爲中國民族表現正義之志士也、此中眞相、尤望貴團諸公、有切實之認識、至於僞政府一切僞政、均由日兵指挥、各省政府之各機關亦然、縣之權在地方自治指導部、而指導部之權在日人、所有軍警行政各權、均直接爲日本所操、三千萬人民之生殺、屬於關東軍之自由、此诚可痛心也、</p>
<p>（五）東北民衆之痛苦</p>
<p>自日軍佔東北之後、强收各交通機關、施行嚴厲之檢查、稍涉嫌疑、即遭捕殺、更時有所聞、其不幸而居戰地者、則妻子離散、轉輾溝壕、血殷原野、年來世界經濟、已極臻恐慌、其能維持遠東之經濟、而不至破産者、實惟東三省是賴、乃自九一八以還、東北各地、困日暴力之擾亂、農村經濟、已實行破産、商業爲之凋敝、財源因之枯竭、經濟爲社會之動力、經濟告窘、社會愈呈不安、此皆日本使之然也、况今春耕期至、而暴力之壓迫未除、農者不得耕其田、賈者不得營其業、一切停頓、危機立至、則此危機、必由東北而波及遠東、以至全世界、故此尚不僅爲東北民衆之痛苦與不幸也、</p>

<h3>蕭德義士軼事</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>國人諗蕭德爲義士矣。然義士平生軼事知者尚鮮。爰記一二於次。義士諱羅伯。年二十六。外傳二十七。誤也。籍美國華盛頓塔喔麥。幼喜飛行事業·常於玩具中表現其事想。暇時輒拆卸眞空洗滌器。摩弄不倦。更研究其裝配。拆而復合。儼然一小機器匠焉。義士視航空爲人世第一快事。愛飛機特甚。太夫人爲適應其個性。送入克的司民用航空學校。畢業後兼習航空軍事。歐戰中期。加入協約國作戰。數數立功。民國十九年春。别母離家。自美至華。下榻海上靜安寺路一百五十號。曾任航空署機師。軍政部航空學校飛行敎官。蒞華後。懐抱滿腔熱忱。與偉大希望。致書歸國。每言吾華民族愛好和平。謙遜有禮。而樂於是土。故太夫人屢招之歸。終不果也。義土生性伶俐。忠勇有爲。誠不知怕懼爲何物。生前係美國俱樂部活動份子。頗孚衆望。滬難初起。日機逞暴。戕害無　。義士憤懣不平。曾向華友作豪語日。苟假我戰鬥機十架。可驅殺日機。片甲不留。惟事不果行。義士怏怏者兼旬。二月二十二日。目覩日機行暴姑蘇。爲天良之驅使。竟獨駕波林輕便驅逐機。奮勇除虐。卒以衆寡懸殊。星殞於野。悲夫。</p>
<h3>桃花與無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>由飄泊的車箱把飄零的我從西子湖畔載回上海來，此番是受盡委屈，痛苦飽嘗。偶一念及［一二八］以前的日子，茫然覺到有如隔世？當車子　然停在龍華的時候，明媚的春光，照耀着那三月將要謝落的桃花，一片春世界，正可拂去點開悉閒恨。然而，春風雖然是這麽的悠悠，可是落紅早經滿地了。殷紅的桃花，班班的像［木乃伊］一樣躺臥在泥土上面，敎人憬然憶起許許多多無名英雄的血，民族的掙扎。</p>
<p>假如不是［一二八］的難發，使上海麻痺的市民以重大的剌激，鐵血與血的狂鳴驚醒了以後··那末，我相信，每年車如流水馬如龍的游春仕女，正爭著擁擁擠擠地在萬樹桃花塢中徘徊欣賞，血輪在徽笑，細胞也在微笑的流連忘返，誰還記起［九一八］？暴風雨的怒吼，正如戰馬的長嘶，朋友們，設使我們心頭的熱血還在，我們的骨骼猶存，我們就該明白，那灼灼的春桃是將要盡行凋萎了，繼續它們嬌媚的姿色，江南依然的風光，那却有待於無名英雄的犧牲了。</p>
<p>無名英雄的血，如碧桃的零脂冷翠，碧桃是冷艶的可愛，血却温熱得動人，春，是這麽的去了夾在砲聲的恐怖中去了。請我們親愛的靑年朋友闭了眼睛想想，十九路軍和抗日的所有弟兄們，他們的血，是爲我們未來换春光　在護花的春泥裏，等待明年重來的飛燕報告他們一個好消息呢。我們今後不願再見到上海小姐唇上怕人的胭脂，惟願少爺們都做個無名英雄！</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器（十八）</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>探照　世界大戰初期。使用探照燈以偵察空中。當時不遇能探照六十　至九十糧的距離。故　收充分的效果。至大戰中期。有能開放百五十　距離五六杆的探照燈出現。至一九二四年。發明百五十　　　型。其光源能對風保護並能旋轉自動。輸送搬移。亦極便利。照明距離。竟達六杆。至是夜間防護敵機的暗　。可無　慮。聽說從前吳淞砲臺與獅子林砲臺所備的探照燈。僅能照明三四　。而日軍軍艦上所用的。則可達六　。加以我軍缺乏高射砲與遠射程砲。空中旣爲敵機任意　炸。口外又不能阻止敵艦進。想到國防。眞眞痛心極了。</p>
<p>他如傳　情報用的器具。是在防空監視除與防衛司令部間所使用的信號。關係尤大。因爲要防備敵機來　　先注意其行動狀况。嚴密偵察。如見敵機不拘距離達近。立即報告各方。且不可有錯誤。譬如用電話報告時。在二三十秒鐘内。簡明準確的傳達監視隊與司令部。那末。就不到誤事了。還有傳達警報用的警笛器。Ｓiren能把壓榨氣與迥蒸氣放出宏喨的聲音。　達各方。最近所用的手提警笛器。除警報空襲外。步啃亦多帶的。我們迥想到這次上海戰爭的情形。敵軍所靠的。不過　　飛機。我軍最吃虧的。就是缺少空軍與没有防空的設備。將來要防備大敵的蹂躪。須唤起防空的注意。防空上最重要的。就是燈火管制。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（三三）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福主人</p>
<p>第五回負義絕交不幸招逢豪客怒關情定策最難消受美人恩話說安玉田追問那魏卓謀。他家園遭刧。怎見得是受了堂叔安大奎的害。魏卓謀就把梅村梅子柯來信中所詳述的情由。一一照實道出。原來安玉田的父親。名呌安大成。從先在前清也曾游宦在外。補過幾任縣缺。積攢下點宦　。老來隠居田里。因爲在這安家寨中。算得是大紳士和著名的首富。便公推他做全寨的村長。近年地方上很不安靖。到處閙着匪禍。他那裏山深林密。民風强悍。又向來是綠林嘯聚之所。在這安家寨附近二三百里的地面。盜匪們千兒八百的算一大竿。一百幾十的算一小竿。殆已司空見慣。出没無常。不算是何種希罕的事。只因安家寨歷來占有很優勝的形勢。一個大寨子周圍有十來里路長。靠山近水。築起一座土城。東南西北四面。各有一道寨門。遠望巍巍峨峨。與城樓一般無二。土砲台就附建在寨樓邊。安置着十幾尊舊式的紅衣鐵砲。其餘土墻上雉　相連。預留下無數槍眼。尤合於新軍事學半永久築城的法則。城下東南二方。有一條小小的護城河。與寨門有弔橋相通。西北方衆山環抱。地形奇險。土墻蜿蜒如龍。直築到那山巅上。後防是更爲穏固。本來這種保　式的寨子。在他們那地方上。凡是些著名的村鎭。幾乎都是這樣的建築。不如是就不能保全本村本鎭的安寗。難免外來盜匪們的侵害。相沿已久。隨處皆然。每村鎭裏的大小户人家。以及各種工商業。均必須聚居在這種有軍事防禦設備的土城内面。城以外便只有阡陌如雲的田畝。怪石嵯峨的山峯。而很少有離羣索居的人烟了。他這安家寨又還是個最著名的大寨。面積比其他小寨寛廣。内容尤極其富厚。除了安大成那一所最大的住宅。其餘磚瓦樓房。還是很多。竟聯結成一兩條很繁盛的市街。百貨雲集。商貿寨途。差不多的小縣城。還不及這般閙熱。旣然如此興旺。自不免會啓附近盜匪們的　　。故此安大成就任村長以來。就極力增加武備。以防萬一。特向公衆捐集了一批公欵。添買了許多新式槍械。練就一隊民團。益發把個安家寨防守得如同鐵桶相似。决不怕再有什麽外來意外的襲</p>

<h3>蕭德犧牲的價値</h3>
<p>— 垢</p>
<p>當蕭德在蘇殉義的時候·我本欲寫兩名表示表示蕭德的慘痛和其義烈的偉大，結果感愧交集，墨和涙流，没有寫成一字一句，</p>
<p>今日爲蕭德公葬的日子，經蕭德義士旌表委員會，竭力籌備，將以極隆重之禮節，安葬於虹橋飛機塲附近，以慰蕭德義士的英靈，我安得無一言以誌其哀悼和敬仰之忱，</p>
<p>蕭德此次在蘇，抵抗日機，犧牲生命，决不能視爲僅因戰事關係而尋常犧牲的一人，蓋蕭德旣非負有美國政府之使命，與日抵抗，亦非負有我國政府請蕭德抗日的使命，是蕭德此次犧牲，完全是蕭德個人，見日軍横暴行爲，到處擲彈，蹂躪我國民衆，是蕭德純粹爲世界正義而犧牲，爲人道而犧牲，這的確是一個顯明的證據，</p>
<p>蕭德爲美國籍，與我國絕無絲毫關係，日人蹂躪我中國，與蕭德更無任何關係，而蕭德見義勇爲，不顧一切，奮勇與日機决鬬，其勇往直前之概，固屬可佳，而蕭德的一滴血，遂能灑遍人間，培植正義之花，滋養公理之果，豎盡千刦，横盡無垠，永遠光輝而不可磨滅，</p>
<p>故蕭母表示，此次長子亡於中國，本人並無遺憾，因彼爲國際正義而死，死有餘榮，誠然，人孰無死，而蕭德之死，最有意義與價値，蕭德不僅爲我國之義士，實爲世界之義士，不但爲世界之義士，實足爲萬世人類之楷模，蕭母其有子矣，我於此敬祝蕭德義士在天之靈，</p>
<p>蕭德爲世界正義而犧牲，的確可以受我國全民的敬禮與崇拜而無愧色，惟不知我國的一般作倀的漢奸，利欲薰心的奸商，和抱不抵抗之有槍階级見之，當作若何之感想，所奇者，此次蕭母到滬，而在滬美人，初無若何之表示，豈以世界公事爲不足重耶？噫！</p>

<h3>蕭德上尉紀念碑歌</h3>

<p>蕭德上尉之死，吾友王君旣爲之傳，茲者蕭母來滬，葬上尉遺骸於虹橋飛機塲，各界有爲上尉立紀念碑之議，爰爲此歌，以促其成，</p>
<p>雷雨如聞轉戰急，精靈閃爍崇碑立，兀地排雲骨作陵，四萬萬人同雨泣，當時敵機江上來，殺氣所透靑天開，鐵彈擲雲不知數，下方人屋皆飛灰，君也慷慨奮臂起，是何醜類乃敢爾，猛虎居然附翼飛，我獨非人忍坐視，水驭飛車逐敵行，敵爲膽落天爲驚，風雲　踏來酣戰，嶽動山搖銀海眩，星官飛將下層霄，闔閭城頭走雷電，敵機上下連環攻，一機應戰何從容，須臾熛火殲賊一，君亦一彈穿當胸，三十三天燭龍墜，忠魂烈魄玻璃碎，嗚呼君死爲誰死，有身但殉正義耳，如君一死關蒼生，華德戈登何足比，浩氣化虹吐千丈，片石嵯峨足瞻仰，至今辟歴響吳天，靈旗甲馬猶來往，我爲君碑贊一詞，三字當刻和平碑，一</p>

<h3>魚雷</h3>
<p>— 夏仁</p>
<p>魚雷爲轟炸兵艦唯一之利器，因其形似大魚故名，其頭尾部作椎圓形，中部圓形，取其減少水力抵抗也，其推進器及舵在末端，能在水中自動前進，或照預定之距離以操縱之，近今可前進達萬　，而有效中的範圍，不過三千　，戰鬥時，可使之沉於水面下約二尺之間，方不易爲敵艦發見，其價値約在九千元或萬餘元。</p>
<p>魚雷發明於一八六六年，推德人懐赫爲最佳，徑十四時，長十一呎，重三百磅，容炸藥二十磅，原動力之空氣壓力第平方吋爲三百七十磅，速度七浬，（現已增大至徑二十吋可容炸藥百磅）能在四百碼外可中碇泊之艦，在二百碼外可中進行之巨艦，當時英美各競購其秘密，不惜十數萬金元，然終不能得德人之秘訣故歐戰時，德國以此爲破英國海軍之唯一武器，英海軍竟爲封鎖，不敢越雷池，美國之加入協約，亦因德潛艇不顧信誼，常假此轟燬其商艦爲藉口。</p>
<p>自後逐漸改良，并發明旋轉機以節制其方向，應用搖錘惰力之理，改良深度之調理，又改鋼鐵造氣室以增氣壓，凡此種種，均非我國兵工之所能制造，其構造約略如下。</p>
<p>（一）曰頭部，又曰鬥頭，乃容炸藥之室也，約佔全長四分之一，内有碰火針及爆信管，前有四翼輪，因水力抵抗而起迴轉運動也，至一定距離時，碰針始擊爆信管，以引起炸藥之爆發，炸藥用濕棉火藥，取其安全而爆力强也，近又改用托落梯爾之類尤佳，以其浸水中數年亦不失其效力，且比重甚大，以補爆力之不足，依試騐結果，二重底軍艦每平方时爲一萬二千磅之壓力，可完全擊破，即在水面下四呎爆發，則相距二十呎之軍艦，皆爲其犧牲品，若平日試演時，可將鬥頭取下改爲假頭，以便測量其進行之狀態，及搖動與深度記錄。</p>
<p>（二）氣室，占全長之半，乃貯藏原動力之壓氣者，約一百五十氣壓，其材料須堅固，工作亦極重要，其造費約佔全部二分之一。</p>
<p>（三）平衡室，安置深淺調整器也，内備搖錘及水壓板，借波形而起振動，搖錘因傾斜而搖擺，兩相作用，藉以操縱横舵也。</p>
<p>（四機關室，内分發動機關減壓機關，及操舵機關三部。</p>
<p>（五）發動機關，用補拉查胡多筒式者爲多，車軸貫浮室中心達尾部以連接二推進機，原動力之壓榨氣由氣室經減壓弇，使一百五十氣壓減至三十氣壓，而入發動機内發動之。</p>
<p>（六）浮室，備縱舵操舵機於此室，用以制魚雷之左右偏差。</p>
<p>（七）車室，内裝斜角齒輪，分傳發動機軸之旋轉運動與互相反應兩推進機者也。</p>
<p>（八）發射魚雷管，管内或用火藥或用壓　氣以發射之，發射管内之　片遂引起魚雷之起動挻以開氣管，於是空氣竄入各部機關之内，而起進行調整作用，惟發射時，於軍艦之搖動大有影響，其搖動常非人力之可制，且可減輕魚雷之中的。</p>
<h3>隨談談</h3>
<h3>典型的人物</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>强光的電燈光，透過淺藍色的燈罩，照耀着壯麗的客廳有如雪地一樣。高貴的客人在受着主人的豐盛的招待。上等雪茄的餘香在屋中縈繞。</p>
<p>中國眞是不得了，上海眞的變成自由市，那末，我們大家將都　　　了　　客似乎是感概的說。</p>
<p>一是　是的，不過中國太弱，始終是弄不好的，老兄，是嗎？這是主人的笑嘻嘻的回答。</p>
<p>是極是極！中國實在太大了，</p>
<p>滿洲即使不給日本拿去也會給赤俄搶去的，那末與其給俄人赤化，到不如讓同文之邦來共存共榮吧。</p>
<p>對呀！正是這樣掋哩！</p>
<p>聽說政府又要借重先生來主持財政了？</p>
<p>哈哈哈·不過有這麽一個消息。但是這還得要老兄特别看待的哩主人又是一陣得意的笑聲。</p>
<p>好說好說。大家都是自家人，只要兄弟在銀行界能夠繼續活動，没有不盡力帮忙的。</p>
<p>是的是的，俗語說；有飯大家吃，哈哈哈···</p>
<p>樓上的牌聲忽然終止，接上是主人的四姨太太命令女僕預備臉水的　駡聲；這使主人非常着急，因爲現在已是陪四姨太太上　　飯店的</p>
<p>時候了，於是不由的面呈難色而躇躊起來。當然聰明的客人能夠立刻會意，拱拱手不勝謝意的辭了出去。一會兒門前便有汽車開動引擎的轟聲。</p>
<p>主人在房子裏凝視着自已的寵兒在輕畫娥眉，一面自已也在媚態的女僕手裏接過嶄新的夜服，更偷偷地在好的腰間揑了一下，於是她不禁　的一聲笑了出來。</p>
<p>哼！你又在偷雞摸狗了？這是姨太太的　嬌。</p>
<p>没有什麽。······快點兒打扮罷，回頭又要來不及了。</p>
<p>半點鐘後，他們便陶醉在戰後的春暖而和平的自由的夜氣中。</p>
<p>東西南北</p>
<h3>東施的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>夕陽的餘輝映射着樓角，炫染出一種橙紅的色彩，徐風在不停的吹拂，熙攘的人們在穿着輕薄的服裝來抗禦這季候所賜予扩熱力。</p>
<p>瞬時，餘輝隠匿了，都市的暮靄裏祇有那點點的電火受着微風的鼓盪在閃爍着照耀。這時，在所謂市中心的一帶，人衆的往來似乎更加多了，有的是被　　樓或　　酒家呑噬進去，有的是在煇煌的玻璃窗外觀望，有的是在提貨店的門前逗留，有的是在閒踱着徘徊，······因着在不同的情况之下，形成了複雜喧囂的音調。</p>
<p>老王，那不是　　路？嘿！這條馬路的仙女是最有名的。</p>
<p>哼！算了吧，那裏會有仙女，至多也不過是個地仙。</p>
<p>你總是這樣不顧事實的胡亂肯定。</p>
<p>怎麽？你···</p>
<p>個女人從他俩的身邊擦過去。</p>
<p>嘿！你看見麽？那個肥胖的女人？阿朱用臂肘搗着老王。</p>
<p>你太無出息了，簡直是瞎子喫蟹隻隻好。</p>
<p>十字路口過了，在一個小弄堂口外人行道的邊綠上，排列着一羣服色鮮艶的不施，雖則是弄堂口外的燈光有些幽暗，但，却不能妨礙她們面部的嬌白、　　王，王，···當他俩經過她們的身旁時，阿朱一面平視着一面在微喊　　去吧，去吧，東施開口了。</p>
<p>阿朱没有甚麽表示，不，也許是忘掉了表示，仍祇繼續的在釘視着，於是，她們知道了，她們知道這是今天望穿秋水而守候的歸宿降臨了，就很不客氣的擁了上去。</p>
<p>在幽暗燈光的搖曳裏，看見他俩的背影被幾個人擁簇着，像綁赴刑塲般的推着邁進，消迷在湫溢的狹弄中。</p>

<h3>Recent Intense Cloud and Rain Between Japan and Russia in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Last year's September 18th Incident, in which Japan suddenly strengthened its power and occupied our Northeast, was, on the one hand, a move by capitalist countries facing the panic of the "Third Period," attempting to salvage their impending doom. It was inevitably the first sound of new competition for markets and the division of colonies. On the other hand, it was also the first act in the preparation by capitalist countries to strengthen their power to confront the socialist Soviet Union and to arrange a battlefield in the Far East. Therefore, although Japan was the main actor in the Northeast Incident, in reality, there were much larger figures behind the scenes. Observing the declarations made last June 24th when the three senior officers of the Japanese Army discussed increasing the number of troops stationed in Taiwan and Korea – the Army Minister Minami's statement that "[at this time, increasing the garrison in Korea would be perceived differently by various countries than before]" and the Chief of Staff Kanaya's declaration that "[currently, our national defense operations are based on mainland operations]" – the implicit meaning is self-evident. We can generally discern the secret drama behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was undoubtedly clear about the true significance of the September 18th Incident. However, it is currently striving to complete its Five-Year Economic Plan and consolidate its socialist economic foundation. In fact, it absolutely cannot allow a war that would expand the battle lines to occur. Therefore, it has repeatedly and solemnly declared its neutral stance on the Northeast Incident and has tried its best to avoid conflict with Japan. Even when Japanese troops crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway and occupied Harbin, it remained silent and expressed nothing, only stating that the Japanese military must not endanger its rights and interests in northern Manchuria. This calm and silent attitude is understood by everyone as an unavoidable forbearance, a defensive strategy to cope with the environment. However, judging from the current facts, the Soviet Union's policy of concession has clearly gradually moved towards failure. In recent months, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has suddenly deteriorated. The activities of White Russians in the Chinese Eastern Railway area in northern Manchuria have almost openly aligned with the police actions of the Manchurian puppet state. It is clear that they have support behind them, and their intention is even more clearly to establish a seemingly similar ["Manchurian puppet state"] regime on the eastern corner of the Soviet Union as a buffer zone. Furthermore, the League of Nations finds it even more difficult to handle the Shanghai case.</p>
<p>China's Hope for League of Nations Assistance is Bound to be Disappointed</p>
<p>Japanese Propaganda About Withdrawing from the League of Nations is Becoming a Reality; European Observers with Foresight Express Their Opinions</p>
<p>All Eyes are Focused on Stimson</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd – The Chairman of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations Assembly, Hymans, and British Foreign Secretary Simon, French representative Boncour, and others previously urged Japanese representative Nagaoka to attend the open meeting of the committee. Afterward, Nagaoka requested instructions from his home government. It is now heard that the Japanese delegation has received instructions from Tokyo that, due to the unfavorable attitude of small countries within the committee towards Japan, it has decided not to attend, and even claimed that Japan does not recognize the Committee of Nineteen. Therefore, the League of Nations finds it even more difficult to handle the Shanghai issue. This deadlock is feared to be difficult to break for the time being.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd – China and Japan are entangled over the date of troop withdrawals from Shanghai, and there is no sign of an early resolution. Europe is therefore greatly uneasy. Those with the best information seem to believe that the Special Committee of Nineteen has fallen into a state of weakness. In moral terms, it may be justified, but the result seems to be that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations, making it impossible for the League to implement its orders. China hopes that the League of Nations can help it reach the other shore. This hope must be dispelled. Furthermore, unless China prepares to curb the anti-Japanese movement, it is difficult to expect the attitude of Japan to become even slightly milder. Observers with foresight expressed their opinion that the real danger now lies in Manchuria. Although news of Sino-Japanese conflicts in Manchuria is no longer as highly valued in Europe as before, it is feared that the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria may secretly incite the new government of Manchuria to send troops to attack Peiping. It is also felt here that when the Lytton Commission report is released in the future, there will inevitably be a despicable dispute between Japan and the League of Nations. As for Geneva, it is still racking its brains to break the current deadlock. Japanese representative Nagaoka hopes to receive new instructions from the Japanese government this afternoon. If so, the Special Committee of Nineteen can still meet on Monday. Nagaoka is still trying his best to find a new solution, but the original instructions from Tokyo are still hidden in his pocket, fearing that formal publication will greatly hinder the possibility of a peaceful resolution. The new instructions from Tokyo are delayed because the Japanese government is currently discussing them with Foreign Minister Yoshizawa. They must wait for the discussion to be completed before sending the instructions to Nagaoka.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – After Foreign Minister Yoshizawa issued a reply to Japanese representative Nagaoka in Geneva that there was no need to attend the Committee of Nineteen, a direct conflict with small countries joining the League of Nations is inevitable. Therefore, Japan's position at the League of Nations General Assembly convened in May will be very unfavorable. At the League of Nations General Assembly, not only will the Shanghai issue be dealt with, but also Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant will be invoked to deal with the Manchurian issue. According to the resolution of March 11, if the dispute cannot be resolved, applying Article 15, Paragraph 4, means that the Council of the League of Nations, based on a unanimous or majority vote, will state the facts of the dispute, prepare a report recommending a just and appropriate solution, and publish it. Therefore, a recommendation may be issued to Japan. If Japan receives this recommendation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will decide to order the Japanese representative to withdraw from the League of Nations. Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations may become a reality.</p>
<p>Japan Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – Regarding the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen, Japan and the committee have not reached a consensus. In order to pre-determine Japan's final attitude, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a lengthy meeting with the army and navy authorities today. As a result, no concrete decision was reached, but the general opinion is that (1) a decision on the withdrawal of Japanese troops by a majority is absolutely opposed; (2) the Mixed Committee's authority regarding the Shanghai Incident to report to the League of Nations or to submit opinions on the timing of troop withdrawals to the League of Nations by a majority is a degree to which concessions may be made.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd – Today, US Secretary of State Stimson met with the chairman of the special committee, Hymans, for more than an hour. Neither side made any public statements afterward, so the content of the conversation is unknown. The American side said that Stimson only listened to Hymans's remarks. Others said that one of the main purposes of Stimson's visit to Geneva was to dispel misunderstandings between Geneva and Washington regarding the Far East issue. Still others said that Stimson used his influence this morning to advocate a more forceful policy, but this statement did not come from official circles and has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Wang and Others Inspect the Front Lines</h3>

<h3>Minor Skirmishes Again Yesterday in the Jinmu Bridge Area</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Activities on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Changshu, 23rd (Special Dispatch) – In the Jinmu Bridge area, the enemy challenged us and was surrounded by our forces. Over seventy enemy soldiers were killed, and numerous machine guns and rifles were seized. There was another skirmish on the morning of the 23rd, which stopped after a while. This morning, five enemy planes circled over Shuangfeng and Xianghua Bridge without dropping bombs. A thorough investigation confirmed that 1,600 households were burned in Qianjing. Kunshan, 23rd (Dispatch) – On the 21st, the enemy attacked Taicang three or four times with three to four hundred troops each time, but were repelled by our forces. Over a dozen enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. The corpses had symbols of the 50th Regiment, 13th Company. Two thousand new Japanese soldiers arrived at Luduqiao, equipped with many artillery pieces and machine guns. Around Xinmu Bridge, there are often over a hundred enemy soldiers appearing and harassing the area.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 23rd (Special Dispatch) – Six to seven hundred enemy troops are stationed in Jiading city. Sentries are posted outside the city every day. Two pieces of the stone slab bridge at the West Gate have been removed. Traffic is restricted from 6 PM onwards. Pedestrians entering and leaving the city use red and green lights as signals. On the morning of the 23rd at 4 AM, over a dozen enemy soldiers near Huangdu came to scout. Our sentries asked for the password, but they did not answer and exchanged fire. We sent reinforcements, and the enemy retreated, with three wounded and one of ours wounded. On the morning of the 23rd, the enemy again reinforced the West Qianjing city with five hundred fresh troops. On the morning of the 23rd, a Japanese plane came from the northeast and circled the city four times before heading southeast. At the same time, a Japanese plane came from Yanglinkou to scout. Two enemy warships are anchored outside Yanglinkou. There are now over three hundred enemy troops in Xintang City and over two hundred in Tang. There are three or four planes and machine guns. Many farmhouses north of Liuhuo have been occupied by the enemy. On the 23rd, enemy planes scattered Japanese newspapers between Jiading and Tang.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 23rd (Special Dispatch) – Enemy reconnaissance units were discovered on the line between West Zhubridge, Yuanjiadu, and Wujiagang, and traffic has been cut off. It seems that they intend to invade Taicang. Enemy General Shirakawa ordered the 5th team to depart for the front lines to occupy Huangdu Station, consisting of two battalions each of infantry and cavalry, one company each of machine gunners and White Russian soldiers, about fifty plainclothes soldiers, and twelve heavy artillery pieces.</p>
<h3>Residents of West Shanghai, Do Not Panic</h3>
<p>The Situation is Not as Serious as Reported</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Increases Police Presence to Maintain Order</p>
<p>In view of the recent rumors in the West Shanghai area, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has specially dispatched additional police to the First Precinct of the Sixth District of Beixinjing to assist in maintaining order in order to maintain local security. According to a responsible person from the Bureau, the situation in West Shanghai is not as serious as reported. Although the Japanese military has increased its defenses, many shops there are still open as usual, and residents should not panic each other.</p>
<h3>True Record of the Current Situation in Taicang</h3>
<p>Refugees Have Returned and the Area Has Been Restored to Its Former Appearance</p>
<p>A letter has been received from the Taicang County Government and County Party Headquarters, stating: "Greetings. Since our anti-Japanese soldiers have firmly defended the second line of defense, Taicang County has become the first area to bear the brunt of the military operations. Shanghai and Suzhou newspapers have reported on the situation in our county on a daily basis. While many of the dispatches are accurate, some are quite different from the facts. This is due to relying on hearsay. Since our county was bombed by Japanese planes on March 2, most residents have left their homes, and news of their homes has been cut off. The only way to inquire is through newspaper reports. However, as mentioned above, this will inevitably affect the hearts of society. Our Party Headquarters and government believe it is necessary to clarify and request corrections. Therefore, we will provide a true record of the current situation in Taicang as follows: Taicang was bombed once by Japanese planes on March 2. Although Japanese planes have always come to the city to scout afterward, there have never been any more bombings. The areas of the county that have been occupied are Liuhuo, Luduqiao, Qianjing, Hejiaqiao, Fuqiao, Xintang City, and other towns. As for the Fuqiao area, the Japanese military had already retreated south a long time ago. The reports that Yue Wang and Pailou were both occupied by the Japanese military are also untrue. Since the opening of the Shanghai ceasefire conference, Taicang has gradually become semi-quiet. According to inquiries, there are about several thousand Japanese soldiers stationed in Liuhuo, all of whom are soldiers from the countryside. As for Qianjing, Luduqiao, and Xintang City, there are only a few hundred soldiers in each place. Because our military's defenses are tight, they have warned each other not to venture further. Therefore, the front lines have been unusually quiet for the past two weeks. The contact reports in various newspapers are unknown. Furthermore, at the beginning of the month, all major and minor newspapers in Shanghai and Suzhou reported that the county public security bureau or the Shuangfeng public security bureau had been robbed of firearms by enemy soldiers, which is even more shocking. At present, the residents who have taken refuge outside have successively returned to the towns and cities. Most of the shops are open as usual, and the order is still peaceful. The morning market and evening glow have already returned to their former appearance. This is the latest situation in Taicang. We hope that you will publish this to correct the rumors."</p>
<h3>Huang Qiang Flew to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>

It is heard that Mr. Huang went to Nanjing to report the progress of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference in Shanghai to Chairman Chiang and other central figures, and will travel to Suzhou to discuss important military matters with Commanders-in-Chief Chiang and Tsai.</p>

According to the reporter of this newspaper's conversation with the person in charge of the Bureau, all schools in the city should lower their flags at that time to show their condolences. However, due to the limited time, it is too late to issue a general notice. It is also reported that students from Nanshi schools who participate should go to Moore Memorial Church separately from 2 PM to form a team, fearing that it would hinder traffic. If it rains this afternoon, the funeral will still be held.</p>
<h3>Major Changes to US Warships</h3>
<p>But These are Routine</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported yesterday (22nd) that according to news from the US Naval Purchasing Office in Shanghai, starting tomorrow (24th) and for the next few weeks, there will be major changes to the US warships stationed in Shanghai. However, these are routine in nature and have no special significance. The destroyer Whipple will leave Shanghai first tomorrow. The destroyer Ford will arrive in Shanghai from Manila next Monday. Thereafter, on April 29, the new 10,000-ton cruiser Rochester will arrive from Gam. After this ship arrives in Shanghai, there will be two US 10,000-ton cruisers in the Huangpu River, one of which is the Houston, the flagship of the Asian Fleet. In addition, the destroyer Paul Jones will also arrive from the south on the 29th. The destroyers Edwards and Pope will arrive on May 8. Thereafter, all ships of the Fifth Fleet will sail to Yantai on May 23 to spend the summer.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Radicals are in the Majority</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that in December of last year, Japanese residents held a general assembly at the Japanese Club on Museum Road and resolved two issues: one was to ban the boycott of Japanese goods, which has been approved by our municipal government, and the other was to protect Japanese residents, which led to the January 28th Incident. It has been three months since then, and the current situation is slightly calmer. Japanese goods have been successively imported, but some good merchants are worried and have not dared to trade openly, resulting in the stagnation of Japanese goods and their inability to move fully. At 4 PM on the 22nd, Japanese residents held another general assembly of Japanese residents in all of China at the Japanese Club, chaired by Yoshii, to discuss reducing or exempting rent, electricity bills, and water bills. The most important point was to complete what they called the ban on the rejection of Japanese goods, punishing Chinese rioters, and protecting overseas Chinese in China. However, some moderate elements, considering the lack of success of resolving issues through force, planned to adopt political tactics on one hand and to dredge local people and industry and commerce on the other, combining both approaches as goals. As a result, the radical and moderate factions argued fiercely. In the end, the radical faction advocating the permanent stationing of troops in Shanghai prevailed, and the proposals were passed to petition the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>A Portion of the Japanese Army is Withdrawing to Japan</h3>
<p>Two Divisions Remain in Shanghai</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese troops deployed to Shanghai for combat were the 9th and 14th Divisions. The remaining troops are now gradually withdrawing. The Independent Siege Heavy Artillery Battalion has already arrived at Wusong at 11 AM yesterday and retreated to their home country by the Maya Maru. Some of the artillery was also transported away. There was also a cavalry team with one hundred and fifty-four military horses, and a team of infantry and artillery from the 8th Division scheduled to go to Japan and Northeast today on the Rokko Maru.</p>
<p>When Naval Landing Forces Commander Nomura came to Shanghai, he transferred all the Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Forces. Many were killed or wounded in the battles of Zhabei and Wusong. Now the 7th Battalion has also been ordered to withdraw to their home country for supplementation and reorganization. Yesterday, Major Ota led the team to the Huangpu and Osaka docks and departed on the special service ships Naruto and Nojima. Munitions and ammunition were also transported with the ships. There are still more than 1,600 naval landing force soldiers remaining in Shanghai. Two Japanese warships escorted each of the departing units.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Ministry dispatched Naval Vice-Minister Horita and Councillor Nishimura to Shanghai to comfort the officers and soldiers on the front lines. Yesterday they completed their work and returned to their duty posts on the Shanghai Maru.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Pays Attention to Shao Peng's Actions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Eastern Railway was originally managed by Qian Jiechen. It is now learned that the puppet state of Manchuria has sent Shao Peng to Shanghai to take over. The municipal government received a report a few days ago and has paid special attention to this matter and ordered strict monitoring of his actions.</p>

<p>Two Important Letters from the National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Request to Guo Taiqi to Conclude the Troop Withdrawal Conference</p>
<p>Request to the Ministry of Railways to Take Over the Eastern Railway Warehouse</p>
<p>The Shanghai United National Salvation Association sent letters and telegrams to the government authorities and local organizations in this city yesterday, putting forward the following proposals:</p>
<p>Letter to Various Organizations: Greetings. The text of the telegram sent by our association to Nanjing is: [To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Council: The transfer of Guo Taiqi to the position of Minister to the United Kingdom, the appointment of Xu Mo as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the appointment of Liu Chongjie as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are matters of personnel administration and not the subject of concern for those in humble positions. However, Guo Taiqi, as the chief representative of the Shanghai troop withdrawal conference, has an attitude of integrity, perseverance, and inflexibility that reassures the public. His transfer to the position of Minister to the United Kingdom should be postponed until the troop withdrawal conference has concluded. It is not advisable to replace the representative midway, which would result in a lack of continuity in intentions and lead to public speculation that cannot be understood by the government. As for Liu Chongjie, his thoughts and words are often perverse, considering the Twenty-One Demands as legitimate and armed resistance against Japan as abnormal. If the government has formally abandoned its long-term resistance policy, then it can employ the likes of Cao Lu and Zhao Xinbo to provide expertise. If it has not abandoned its resistance policy, then allowing such sycophantic and self-humiliating individuals to participate in diplomatic secrets will not bring good fortune to the country's future. Our association is concerned and dare not remain silent. We hereby telegram our opinion in the hope that it will be considered. Respectfully, the Shanghai United National Salvation Association, April 23.] This matter concerns the future of diplomacy, and we hope that all will advocate together and send telegrams to the government, paying attention to it. We are fortunate. Sincerely, the Shanghai United National Salvation Association, April 23.</p>
<p>Letter to the Ministry of Railways, etc.: Yesterday, the association sent letters to the Ministry of Railways, the Songhu Garrison Command, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Public Security Bureau, stating: "Greetings. The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Eastern Railway is located at No. 5 Guangdong Road in this city and has a warehouse in Pudong, specializing in the import and export of goods along the railway. Qian Jiechen has been the director of the office. Now, the Chinese-owned shares of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been usurped by a puppet organization under Japanese wings, openly ordering the office to use the so-called 'Great Harmony First Year' calendar. Director Qian resigned to avoid the situation. The puppet council under the puppet organization openly appointed Shao Peng of Suzhou to take over the position. He arrived three days ago to oversee the office. Although he did not dare to display the puppet flag, he dared to use the rebellious calendar in broad daylight. Where is the national law? Our association believes that such traitors should be strictly arrested and prosecuted, and the office and warehouse under their control should be taken over by personnel from the Ministry of Railways to discuss and deal with the matter with the Soviet Russian council. We hereby send this letter respectfully requesting that you investigate and deal with the matter according to law. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Shao Peng Denies Being Appointed as Deputy Director of the Eastern Railway Shanghai Office</h3>
<p>Mr. Shao Peng wrote a letter stating: "To the Editor: I have just read a report in today's newspaper titled 'There is Actually a Puppet State Agency in This City,' which states that I have formally embraced the Great Harmony Era and refers to me as willingly being a traitor, which is extremely surprising. I have been the manager of the Shanping Insurance Company at No. 48 Sichuan Road in this city for many years. I have never heard of politics, nor have I left Shanghai. Since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, I have been working hard on rear-area relief, comforting refugees and wounded soldiers, and all patriotic work. I have not dared to lag behind others. A few days ago, I suddenly received news that the Eastern Railway appointed me as the Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office. I had not been contacted beforehand, nor have I accepted the appointment. Even if the report that the Eastern Railway appointed me to succeed the Chinese director of that agency is true, it is only a unilateral action on the part of the Eastern Railway. Since I have not agreed to it nor have I accepted the appointment, it has no legal connection to me. I am not responsible for any affairs of the Eastern Railway. However, since my reputation is at stake, I cannot allow it to be ambiguous. I hereby present the truth and ask that this letter be published in major newspapers to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Shao Peng."</p>
<h3>Guangdong慰勞Delegation Returns to Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Guangdong delegation to慰勞 the 19th Route Army, led by Ren Zhimmei and four others, returned to Guangdong yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 am on the French郵輪 George Philippar.</p>
<p>Sichuan Youth Dare-to-die Corps Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Sichuan Youth Dare-to-die Corps wrote yesterday stating, these few soldiers due to important business specially dispatched representatives Yang Jichong, Chen Heming, Chen Wanlan, etc. to Shanghai to specifically consult with the Sichuan Shanghai Association and various anti-Japanese groups regarding everything. Yesterday, they took the China Merchants Jiang'an commercial ship and happened to be received by Mr. Zhang Xiaolin of Shanghai at the ship's dining room and received all instructions. The representatives arrived in Shanghai this afternoon and are currently staying at the Sichuan Hall on Ermalu. Therefore, a special announcement is made to express their gratitude.</p>
<h3>Fujian Compatriots Telegraphically Request Suppression of Communists</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fujian Jian Region Six Counties Association yesterday convened an emergency meeting and resolved to telegraph the government requesting that troops be sent to Fujian to suppress the Communists. The original telegram stated: "Chairman of the Nanjing National Government Lin, President of the Executive Yuan Wang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Chiang, Minister of Military and Political Affairs and Commander-in-Chief of Communist Suppression in Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian He: This time, the Red bandits have attacked southern Fujian, capturing Longxi and Zhangzhou, and invading northward into Chong'an and Pu'cheng, advancing north and south seemingly with a plan. The situation in northern Fujian is crucial to Jianning and the Fujian situation is particularly important. We earnestly request that you telegraph neighboring provinces to send large armies swiftly to northern Fujian to encircle and suppress the Communists together with the Liu and Lu armies. A tearful plea in the final telegram."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Minnan Fellow-Provincials Association telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating: [To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Military and Political Department: The chaos in Fujian Province has lasted for many years, the people are displaced and urgently need to be settled. The government treats Fujian as if it were something to be gotten rid of and has no effective measures. Fujian people inside and outside the province feel disappointed. Now that Zhangzhou and Longxi have fallen one after another, Quanzhou and Xiamen are in imminent danger. We urgently request that you quickly plan and maintain stability to avoid the expansion of the chaos. We cannot express our anxiousness to await your orders. The Minnan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai bows.]</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Protests Against Report of Japanese Plane Crash in Pudong, Says It Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>No Large Contingent of Japanese Troops Landed</p>
<p>Regarding the report that a Japanese plane crashed in Donggou, Pudong, and that a large contingent of Japanese naval and land forces had landed, the Municipal Government has issued a formal protest. A National News Agency reporter therefore visited a responsible official of the Municipal Government, who stated that the matter was not accurate. At the time, the Municipal Government learned of the Japanese plane crash and immediately planned to send officials to retrieve it, but the Japanese side stated that it must send its own team to retrieve it. After Mayor Wu objected, the Japanese side requested to send four soldiers and ten engineers on a ship to retrieve it. This matter was immediately resolved. As for the report that a large contingent of armed Japanese troops had landed, the Municipal Government had not received any formal report and therefore had not issued a written protest.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Federation Convened Yesterday</h3>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>Ding and Li Send a Letter to the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Stating the Atrocities of the Japanese Army in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Expressing the Determination of the Self-Defense Army to Resist Japan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ding Chao, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Railway Protection Army, and Li Du, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, recently sent a report to the League of Nations Investigation Team, detailing the atrocities of the Japanese army in the Northeast since the September 18th Incident. The report is divided into six points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Organization of the Jilin Self-Defense Army After the Japanese army occupied Jinzhou, the last bastion of the Northeast was lost. Only Binxian and 27 other counties under the jurisdiction of the Jilin Provincial Government remained as a clean area. Harbin was the center of the northern part of the three provinces. In order to seize it, the Japanese instigated Xi Qia and others to send troops to attack Yushu and other counties on January 16. Zhang Zuozhou, Feng Zhanhai and other troops fought hard against the enemy. On the same day, Doihara went to Harbin to serve as the director of the Japanese special service agency and secretly planned the northward invasion. Feng Zhanhai's army was defeated on the 25th and detoured from Acheng to eastern Harbin. On the morning of the 26th, they attacked Harbin. Du's troops arrived at the same time. On the 27th, they engaged in battle with Yu Shencheng's troops 15 li from Harbin. Yu's army was defeated and routed. At the same time, two Japanese planes flew to Harbin and dropped three bombs on the 26th Brigade Headquarters, one of which was shot down by the cavalry. Chao and other officials are responsible for taking appropriate defense measures. The 24th Brigade led by Du, the 28th Brigade led by Chao, the 22nd Brigade led by Zhao Yi, the 25th Brigade led by Mu Xianzhang, the 26th Brigade led by Song Wenjun, the 29th Brigade led by Wang Ruihua, the Provisional 1st Brigade led by Feng Zhanhai, and the cavalry led by Gong Changhai formed the Jilin Self-Defense Army. Du was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Army and Chao was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Railway Protection Army. At the same time, the troops of Chao and Du were combined to form a joint army with its headquarters in Binxian. On January 31, they telegraphed China and foreign countries, explaining the purpose of protecting the railway, resisting Japan, defending the country, and defending the people.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese Army's Destruction of the Eastern Railway and the Situation of Our Army's Defense</p>
<p>In order to occupy Harbin, the Japanese army planned to pass through the Eastern Railway, but was rejected by the Eastern Railway. The Japanese army took direct action and forcibly occupied the Kuanchengzi Station of the Eastern Railway on January 28, robbing and killing road workers, detaining vehicles and goods, and forcing road workers to drive to transport troops. At 9:00 pm, two Japanese armored trains loaded with Japanese soldiers left Changchun for Harbin. After occupying the stations south of the northern gate, our army took appropriate defense measures to protect the railway. From January 26 to February 4, they engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in Shuangchengpu and Sanjianbao. Until the 5th, the Japanese air force came to cover the army's advance and dropped hundreds of bombs, causing heavy damage to our army. The Japanese Tani Brigade and Domon Division continued to attack. Our army withdrew from Harbin in consideration of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign expatriates. At 4:40 pm, the Japanese army occupied the Harbin Railway Station. Chao and others led some of their troops to retreat to Binxian, Acheng, Yilan and other places to gradually recover the lost land.</p>
<p>(3) The Volunteer Army and the Self-Defense Army Cooperate to Resist Japan After Chao and others withdrew, the Japanese side sent six Japanese planes from Changchun on February 18 and 19 to bomb the headquarters of the Binxian Self-Defense Army. When the Self-Defense Army moved to Fangzheng, the Japanese army forced Xi Qia's army to attack on all sides. The masses of the Self-Defense Army were indignant. The volunteer army led by Wang Delin first joined our army. On the 20th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Yanji and Dunhua. Chao and others led their troops to recover the Hasui Line of the Eastern Railway. On the 22nd, they captured Wumihe and advanced to Yimianpo. On the 24th, they occupied Weishahe. On the 26th, Du led his troops to advance towards Harbin. At this time, the Japanese side was brewing a puppet organization and feared that it would be defeated. They also sent the Amano Brigade to Yimianpo. Chao and others could not move forward and fiercely suppressed them. On March 1, Wang Delin's troops attacked Ning'an and Hailin, defeating the Japanese army. On March 21, Chao and others led their troops to defeat Xi Qia's Japanese army and besieged Xiachengzi. The volunteer armies from all over came to join them, and their momentum grew greatly. The Japanese army wanted to eliminate our country's strength and cover the eyes and ears of China and foreign countries. They also advanced fiercely from Binxian and Zhuhe. Our army made proper defense again. From March 26 to April 3, they resisted with all their strength and repelled the Japanese army. The Japanese army used 20 planes to cover the operation and bombed and threw many 250-pound bombs in Fangzheng, Yilan and other counties, towns and villages, killing many people and causing heavy losses. The headquarters of this army moved from Fangzheng to Yilan, and on April 5, 6, 7, etc., Japanese planes flew to Yilan to bomb. Our losses were even greater.</p>
<p>(4) Puppet Organizations Under Violence</p>
<p>The purpose of the Japanese iron cavalry's horizontal and vertical movement is to establish a new regime, break away from China, and implement its annexation steps. On March 9, the Japanese made arrangements for Puyi to issue an absurd declaration. The organization of the puppet state and the designation of personnel are all forged and forced by the Japanese. Puyi was the former emperor of the Qing Dynasty and had abdicated during the Chinese Revolution. Japan is willing to use Puyi to cover the eyes and ears of the world and prepare for its complete annexation of the three northeastern provinces. It can never deceive the international community with national self-determination. When Puyi took office in Changchun, people from all over expressed their opposition. On March 10, all the legal groups in Jilin sent a telegram denying the puppet state. Furthermore, Honjo was attacked by 300 plainclothes soldiers on his way back to Shenyang. These so-called bandits by the Japanese are actually righteous people who are angry at the Japanese invasion and are willing to sacrifice their lives for the Chinese nation. It is hoped that your delegation will have a clear understanding of the truth. As for all the false administrations of the puppet government, they are all commanded by Japanese soldiers, as are the various organs of the provincial governments. The authority of the county is in the local autonomous guidance department, and the authority of the guidance department is in the Japanese. All military, police, and administrative powers are directly controlled by the Japanese. The life and death of 30 million people belong to the freedom of the Kwantung Army. This is really heartbreaking.</p>
<p>(5) The Suffering of the People in Northeast China</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, it has forcibly taken over all transportation agencies and implemented strict inspections. Anyone suspected of wrongdoing will be arrested and killed. It is often heard that those who are unfortunate enough to live in the war zone are separated from their wives and children, and roll around in ditches, with blood spilling over the wilderness. In recent years, the world economy has been extremely panic-stricken. The only way to maintain the economy of the Far East without going bankrupt is to rely on the three northeastern provinces. However, since the September 18th Incident, various places in the Northeast have been disturbed by Japanese violence, the rural economy has been bankrupted, commerce has been declining, financial resources have been depleted, and the economy is the driving force of society. The more the economy is in trouble, the more unstable the society becomes. This is all caused by Japan. Moreover, now that the spring plowing season is approaching, the oppression of violence has not been eliminated, farmers cannot cultivate their fields, merchants cannot run their businesses, everything is stagnant, and a crisis is imminent. This crisis will inevitably spread from the Northeast to the Far East and even the whole world. Therefore, this is not only the suffering and misfortune of the people in the Northeast.</p>
<p>(6) The Determination of the Self-Defense Army</p>
<p>The three northeastern provinces were developed by our Han people with their own hands and feet. The population is 30 million, and pure Han people account for 95%. It is also a place for the consumption of China's surplus population, and it is also a place for the material construction of North China to obtain all raw materials. Chao and others are determined to preserve the integrity of China's territory, as well as the lives and property of the Chinese nation. If Japan forcibly takes it away, and if it does not comply with the League of Nations resolution and return it, we will take it back by force, no matter how long it takes. This should be declared to the members of your delegation. Of the 30 million people in the Northeast, those who have not entered the Japanese sphere of influence and still have freedom are now only 12 counties, including Yilan, Boli, Fangzheng, Tonghe, Fujin, Muling, Mishan, Baoqing, Tongjiang, Fuyuan, Raohe, and Hulin, which still fly the flag of the Republic of China. The remaining counties are covered with puppet flags, and the people have lost their freedom of will. If your delegation still wants to seek public opinion and conduct research, it will be a farcical tragedy. It can be asserted now that once your delegation leaves the customs, it will be welcomed wherever it goes. Among the welcoming team, there will be our compatriots who have lost protection, holding slogans issued by Japan. If you ask them, "Do you want independence? Is it your intention to break away from China?" Then they will hesitate to answer, "We are willing to be under the organization of the Japanese army." All Chinese people who meet on formal occasions will answer in unison, "We are willing to break away from China." Why? If one word is violated, the disaster of destroying the family and destroying the body will immediately occur. How can we spy on the true public opinion? Now that Japan has contracted the puppet state, and the salt tax and customs duties have all declared independence, merging various roads and taking over postal and telecommunications, everything is in its control. The facts of the invasion have been greatly exposed. After you leave the customs, you will see the truth of the September 18th Incident displayed in front of you. Taking this real situation as the object of research will be of the greatest benefit in promoting the implementation of the League of Nations resolution. This is what 30 million people in the Northeast are eagerly looking forward to, and your mission will be a success. Chao and others led their troops to make proper defense against Japan. Due to the urgency of military affairs, they were unable to pay their respects to you and describe everything in detail. This telegram is a statement of the self-defense process of our army, and also expresses our welcome. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>The Puppet State Orders Zang Shiyi to Meet</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign news, the puppet state instructed the puppet Shenyang Provincial Government that if the investigation team comes to visit, Zang Shiyi will meet them to explain the current situation of the puppet state.

<h3>Yu Chonghan and Others Accuse Japan of Crimes</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Chonghan, Zhang Jinghui, and Yuan Jingkai previously asked a certain gentleman to express their feelings to the investigation team when it arrived in Beijing, saying that Chonghan and others have been threatened by the Japanese for a long time and had to temporarily succumb. Now that your delegation is about to arrive in Shenyang, the time for Chonghan and others to die has arrived. Now, I would like to cry and tell you the following items: (1) All officials, gentry, businessmen, and civilians in the Northeast who recognize the establishment of the puppet state are not sincere. (2) The Japanese hired many Koreans, posing as Chinese, to surround and stop the actions of your delegation in order to cover up the truth of their massacre of merchants and civilians. (3) The Japanese brutally killed more than 100,000 Chinese merchants and buried 200 employees of the Siping-Taonan Railway alive. (4) All the soldiers and civilians who surrendered to the Japanese were threatened. When your delegation arrives in Shenyang, they will immediately revolt. (5) Chonghan and others are now like prisoners and have lost all freedom. (6) The Japanese army sent 3,000 police officers to search for agricultural products in various villages, claiming that they would prepare for war with the world. The official price is less than one-twentieth of the market price, so Chinese merchants are united as a national salvation army. (7) Japan transferred 300,000 Koreans and divided up the civilian land in various counties. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Insufficient Cars When Passing Through Dalian</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Dalian talked about the fact that when the investigation team arrived in Dalian, the Japanese forcibly ordered all shops to remove the puppet state flags that they had been hanging up. The Japanese only provided four cars for the investigation team, which were for the members and Gu Weijun to ride in. The Chinese representatives were all carrying their luggage and walking.

<h3>Songhua River to Thaw Soon</h3>

However, there are 75,000 tons of miscellaneous grains stored between Harbin and Sanxing, and another 250,000 tons north of Sanxing, all waiting to be transported to Harbin. If the shipping companies can negotiate privately with Li Du, then Manchukuo may not object. If Manchukuo does object, then this grain will inevitably be imported into Soviet Russia, because if this cargo cannot be transported to Harbin, there will be no other buyers to purchase it. If the shipping companies fail to reach a satisfactory agreement with Li Du, then this year's shipping business will completely fail, and all trade will be severely affected.

<h3>Chinese Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Proposes Convening a Board Meeting</h3>
<p>(Harbin) It is reported that the Chinese directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway have held several meetings to discuss the matter of transporting vehicles and other items into Russian territory. Later, it was decided that a certain director would seek the opinions of the Russian directors, but so far there have been no results. The Chinese directors are now proposing to convene a board meeting in order to seek the Russian representatives' concrete opinions. The Director-General of the Chinese Eastern Railway has formally reported to the board of directors that the protection of the Chinese Eastern Railway is not sufficient and that measures should be taken immediately to ensure the safety of trains and railway personnel. The board of directors has discussed this in detail. It is reported that the Chinese directors have agreed to request the Manchukuo government to organize a more reliable railway protection team, but the area from Shitouhezi to Suifenhe is currently occupied by the old Jilin army. The Manchukuo government will certainly not be able to fully protect the entire railway. Therefore, it is generally expected that this move by the Director-General of the Railway Bureau is a prelude to a formal protest by the Soviet Russian government. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Military Strategist Recommends Adopting a Quasi-Conscription System</h3>
<p>National Defense Forces Reduced to Sixty Divisions</p>
<p>Two Hundred Regiments of Regular Defense Corps</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military strategist suggested to the Military Affairs Commission that the number of national defense troops used in this anti-Japanese war is not large, but the country supports a large army of more than 150 divisions, consuming 90% of annual revenue, resulting in the inability to carry out all internal affairs construction. The result will inevitably lead to both soldiers and civilians being in dire straits and perishing together. A deep awakening should be made after this national crisis. The national defense forces should be reduced to sixty divisions and sent to the border provinces. Each division should receive a monthly salary of 120,000 and a manufacturing fee of 30,000. The annual military expenditure should be based on 10.8 million. Another 92 million yuan should be used to establish local defense corps similar to conscription, with staggered retirements and alternating training, local conscription and retirement, and compiled into regular reserve forces. All troops stationed in the interior should be bound by the system laws and regulations of the defense corps. If this is done, 92 million yuan can be used to train 200 regiments of regular defense corps, calculated at 1,500 men per regiment, with 300,000 men in peacetime. With one retirement per year, after five years, in the event of an emergency, 1.5 million men can be effectively mobilized, and the cost is only equivalent to the number of 200,000 hired soldiers. Statistics show that the annual military expenditure for 60 divisions of regular national defense forces and 200 regiments of defense corps is only 200 million yuan, compared to the 600 million yuan needed annually for military expenses and salaries in recent years, which is only one-third. What are the gains and losses? At present, there are still military personnel who oppose the conscription system for the sake of possessing troops and benefiting themselves, saying that household registration must be investigated clearly before it can be started. If this is said, there will be no opportunity to implement conscription even after a hundred years. Now, we can first establish a local defense corps in the quasi-conscription style when household registration is not accurate, which can promote the clarity of household registration. ) 23rd Special Dispatch (</p>

<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Leaves Beiping for Northeast</p>
<p>The Course of the Dispute over Detouring Through Dalian</p>
<p>Will Rent South Manchurian Railway Cars to Depart for Investigation</p>
<p>Will Still Return to Beiping Around Mid-June</p>
<p>Wei Tao-ming Expresses Sacrifice for the Country</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, Recent news regarding the departure of the League of Nations investigation team from the pass has been extremely confusing. The reason for this is that the investigation team itself is responding to events as they unfold and does not have firm and definite views. The Chinese representative is in a position to assist the investigation team, so it is not appropriate to have absolute opinions that would hinder the investigation team's work outside the pass. Japan, hiding behind the so-called "Manchukuo," is using its opposition to the Chinese representative to obstruct the investigation team's trip to Manchuria, and this is the essence of its constantly changing tactics. It was only yesterday (the 19th) that it was decided to go to Dalian by sea, which is entirely in accordance with Japan's wishes. The Chinese government originally insisted on departing from the Beining Railway, but it telegraphed on the night of the 18th to indicate that it did not object to taking the sea route, so Wei Tao-ming immediately notified the investigation team, and the date of departure was largely finalized. Japan had originally dispatched two destroyers to Dagukou to wait for use, but upon hearing that China was sending the Haiqi warship, it also dispatched a larger cruiser for use. The team is scheduled to take the special car originally prepared by the Beining Railway to Qinhuangdao, and then take the special warships provided by China and Japan in two batches to Dalian. From Dalian, they will take the South Manchurian Railway car to Shenyang. After arriving in Shenyang, if they go to various places for investigation, they will also rent vehicles from the South Manchurian Railway. The investigation team recognizes the Chinese and Japanese governments as its counterparts. The so-called puppet states of Manchuria and Mongolia are not qualified to host the team, so the</p>
<p>team would rather detour through Dalian to Shenyang and then rent South Manchurian Railway cars to go to Jinzhou and other areas for investigation than change to the special car of the puppet Fengshan Railway at Shanhaiguan. The Haiqi warship arrived in Qinhuangdao yesterday (the 19th). The people scheduled to take the ship were our representative, Wei Tao-ming, and his staff, as well as Lord Lytton, Count Aldrovandi, General McCoy, Haas, and others. Japanese representative Yoshida, together with French commissioner General Claudel and Dr. Schnee, will take a certain Japanese warship. They will depart from Qinhuangdao at the same time and are scheduled to arrive in Dalian before 7:00 p.m. on the 20th. After all members of the investigation team disembark at Qinhuangdao, the special car of the Beining Railway will immediately return to Tianjin. The situation of the team's departure from Beiping and passing through Tianjin is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Scene of Departure The entire League of Nations investigation team, a total of more than 40 people, including the five members of the investigation team and their staff of more than ten people, the Chinese representative and their staff of twenty-one people, and the Japanese side of ten people, left Beiping on the Beining special car at 10:25 p.m. on the 19th. The send-off at the station was extremely grand. In advance, the Pacification Headquarters dispatched a company of guards, and the Haiqi band and the garrison band were arranged at the station for send-off and guard duty. The station was brightly lit with electric lights. Those who sent off entered the station wearing badges and lined up in order. Those who attended included Beiping Mayor Zhou Dawen, Garrison Commander Yu Xuezhong, Pacification Headquarters Chief of Staff Rong Zhen, Chief Counselor Wan Fulin, General Affairs Director Zhu Guangmu, Adjutant Director Tang Guozhen, as well as representatives from various agencies and organizations, and officials from various embassies, totaling about five or six hundred people. The special car stopped at the second platform, which was neatly arranged. The Pacification Headquarters also dispatched a company of guards to board the car for escort. At 9:50 p.m., Wei Tao-ming and his wife arrived at the station with the five commissioners, including Lytton, and entered the reception room of the B car. Wei and Lytton stood and talked, appearing very happy. Madam Wei, on the other hand, had a melancholy expression, unable to bear the sorrow of parting. At that time, Wei stated to others that he was determined to sacrifice for the country on this trip to the east and would not hesitate to do everything to complete the mission he was entrusted with. Soon after, Zhang Xueliang arrived and entered the car, shaking hands with Lytton and others in succession to pay their respects. They sat down and talked for about twenty minutes. Zhang got out of the car, and Lytton and others got out of the car to greet and thank those who sent them off. At 10:25 p.m., all the commissioners boarded the car. Zhang Xueliang shook hands with them one by one to bid farewell. The special car slowly started amid the melodious music. Zhang and Madam Wei waved their handkerchiefs at the station to send them off. Yu Xuezhong, Rong Zhen, Wan Fulin, and others also raised their hands to salute. The five commissioners, including Lytton, nodded frequently in response, until they left the station.</p>
<p>Future Itinerary The investigation team announced its future itinerary on the evening of the 19th, stating that after arriving in the Northeast, it would stay for four weeks to conduct investigations, and then go to Japan via Korea. After leaving Japan, it would still return to Beiping. At that time, it would be around mid-June. The number of days spent in Beiping has not been determined. In the future, it will still go to Japan and then transfer to Nanjing, China. Finally, it will choose a location in China to compile the general report.</p>
<p>Telegraphing the League of Nations The itinerary of the League of Nations investigation team outside the pass, after being decided at the meeting on the evening of the 18th, a telegram to the League of Nations Council in Geneva was drafted on the morning of the 19th, reporting that the affairs in Beiping were completed and that the investigation would begin outside the pass on the same day. The telegram was sent one hour before the investigation team departed. Also, Lord Lytton and others received Tang Yulin's representative Xu Jingbao, chairman of Jehol, at 10:30 a.m. on the 19th to inquire about the situation in Jehol. At 11:00 a.m., they met with Shen Honglie, commander of the Northeast Navy, to discuss matters concerning taking a warship to the east. Our Representative's Participation in the Investigation Team Our representative, Wei Tao-ming, and his staff held a meeting on the evening of the 18th to discuss the itinerary outside the pass, and it did not disperse until 4:00 a.m. on the 19th. It was decided that the number of people accompanying would be 21. It was planned that after arriving in Qinhuangdao, they would take the Haiqi warship to Dalian. Staff members such as Zhao Deqing and Chen Yanjiong decided to stay in Beiping because they could not inspect the area outside the pass by taking the Beining Railway. The Haiqi warship arrived in Tanggu on the evening of the 18th. Due to the change in itinerary, it arrived in Qinhuangdao again at 3:00 p.m. on the 19th for use. The list of Chinese representatives and their staff is recorded as follows: Representative Wei Tao-ming, Staff Liu Chongjie, Yang Jingbin, Yan Enbiao, Xiao Jirong, Duanna, He Tu, Zou Enyuan, Chen Liting, Gu Zhizhong, Ge Gongzhen, Bao Jingan, Zhang Weibin, Liu Qingpei, Yang Chengji, Shi Zhaoji, Li Hongshi, You Jian, Gu Changyan, Chen Yichun, Xie Enzeng, and seven servants.</p>
<p>Wei's Remarks Wei Tao-ming told reporters at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th, "The journey of the investigation team to the Northeast has involved many twists and turns after negotiations. It was discussed when we were about to leave Shanghai. The Japanese side hoped to go to Dalian, saying that the railways outside the pass were damaged. China believed that Shanhaiguan was the gateway to Shenyang, and we should enter through the main gate to go deeper. Moreover, places along the road, such as Jinzhou, are all relevant places that must be seen. The investigation team also thought so. After arriving in Beiping, our side strongly advocated going by rail, but the Japanese side said that it would be inconvenient to protect us. There was an idea of ​​dispatching troops to protect us, but the central government believed it was unnecessary, and the investigation team also believed it was inappropriate. Therefore, there was a tendency to accommodate the Japanese side's opinion. The investigation team was eager to go out of the pass to conduct investigations so that it could report to the League of Nations before May 1 whether Japan had complied with the resolution to withdraw its troops. The Chinese representative is assisting the work of the investigation team, so it is inappropriate to affect the investigation team's itinerary due to the route problem, which would hinder the urgent work, and would not be the original intention of assisting the team in handling affairs. Therefore, the government finally complied with the team's wishes and no longer objected to going to Manchuria by sea, but still stated that the Chinese representative reserved the right to free action after leaving the pass. The investigation team has expressed its understanding on this point. As for the Chinese representative, he was appointed based on the League of Nations resolution, and will not care about any opposition. He is determined to complete the mission with a firm will."</p>
<p>Passing Through Tianjin Late at Night Tianjin News, after the Beiping authorities received the report about the departure of the League of Nations investigation team's special car, they immediately arranged everything at the East and Main stations. National flags were hung all over the platforms, and they were decorated with electric lights, shining brightly. By 1:00 a.m. on the 20th, martial law was enforced near the two stations, and special agents from the Public Security Bureau were distributed near the two stations to be on guard. Even those who held welcome certificates were not allowed to walk across the overpass. Soon after, a road-roller car arrived in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Left Tianjin at 1:30 AM to the East At 1:50 AM, the special car arrived at the New Station and left after a brief stop at the Old Station, where the locomotive was changed and coal and water were added. At 2:40 AM, the car started heading east. At that time, the team had already gone to bed, so no one was met. (20th)</p>

<h3>Notice Regarding the Anti-Opium Society's Concern Over the Revival of Opium Public Sales</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, noting the increasing atmosphere of opium public sales in Fujian and Anhui provinces, and hearing rumors that the central government is also brewing a revival of the public sales system, has issued a declaration urging the nation to pay attention. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>[To all compatriots of the nation: Last spring, the internationally shocking opium public sales system, which caused a nationwide sensation, was once implemented. Wu Yulin initiated it, and Li Jihong supported its success. The central financial authorities, misled by its profits, disregarded public opinion and announced its implementation, suppressing the people's spirit. Fortunately, the people's hearts were not dead, and they unanimously rose up in opposition, with overwhelming momentum. The authorities were also intimidated and temporarily retreated, ordering its cancellation. However, everyone knew that this was only a temporary appeasement and not a complete withdrawal. Indeed, before long, the news of Anhui Province establishing a "Prohibition and Investigation Bureau" shocked the country and was widely reported in various newspapers. The central authorities remained silent. Subsequently, the troops stationed in southern Fujian pressured farmers to plant opium and collect taxes, but did the central government not know about this, or did it not care? Recently, Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, colluded with the stationed troops to implement opium public sales. The central government remains silent, and although various foreign embassies and consulates have sent urgent telegrams, they have received no response. Chen Diaoyuan and Fang Shengtao, the masterminds behind the public sales in Anhui and Fujian, have not been punished according to the law. Such measures suggest that the central government is intentionally condoning and tacitly approving it. Recently, the atmosphere of public sales has become more prevalent. Reports indicate that the military authorities in North China, due to a lack of military funds, have decided to implement opium public sales. The plan involves establishing a public sales office in each of the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Hebei, with Gao Jiyi in charge, expecting a monthly income of two million yuan. Furthermore, anti-opium comrades across the country have sent telegrams reporting that the central government is financially exhausted and misled by proponents of public sales, seeking to exploit the national crisis by cleverly establishing a name to revive the public sales system. Comrades abroad have also reported that the central financial authorities are borrowing a large national debt from a certain country, using the revenue from opium public sales as collateral. Alas, what time is this? What kind of talk is this? What are you gentlemen thinking? At a time when the country is fragmented, foreign troops are rampant, and the survival of the nation is in jeopardy, with the threat of joint administration looming, the authorities should be too busy saving the nation to even consider it. What are they thinking, reviving the old dream of public sales? It seems that the central government has never forgotten this matter since abandoning public sales last year. The reason it has not been immediately revived is only waiting for the right opportunity. If the opium public sales system is truly a good system, why have European and American countries not followed suit during their economic downturns? Why do they not see this as a source of profit, while China is treated like a favored child, enjoying its benefits alone? Why do the colonial policies of major powers use the opium public sales system as a tool to weaken the people's spirit and extract profits? Japan immediately implemented opium public sales in Taiwan, and it is also actively implementing this system in Dalian. Now, after occupying the four northeastern provinces, its first priority is to implement opium public sales, as repeatedly reported in various newspapers. The facts are clear. What do the gentlemen in authority see that they insist on applying the colonial policies used on others to their own people? Is this not digging their own graves? How can people be so unconscionable? This society, entrusted by the will of the whole people, takes pure anti-opium as its stance, regardless of politics or party strife. It only asks that the government does not violate the Premier's policy of complete prohibition and permanently abolish any opium prohibition measures with the nature of public sales. Other political issues are not of concern. If opium must be used as a source of profit, this society will resolutely oppose it, even if it means certain destruction. Now that the talk of reviving public sales has resurfaced, this society cannot shirk its responsibility to fight to the death. We hope that all sectors of the country will pay attention. At a time when the national crisis is urgent and the nation's attention is focused on foreign affairs, it is precisely when villains are advancing their treacherous schemes and using public office for private gain. Either they cleverly establish names to revive public sales, or they blatantly disregard the consequences and implement them. The authorities may not dare to do this, and villains may not dare to come up with this, but the people should be prepared to prevent being deceived and rise up to monitor the authorities and support the prohibition of opium. Do not neglect this harm because the war is not yet over, and do not give those who advocate public sales and unscrupulous officials the opportunity to carry out their evil schemes. The survival of opium prohibition depends on this action. We hope all sectors of society will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Proves the Authenticity of Anli Yanghang's "Men Yu" Fish</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, people from all walks of life have become increasingly激昂. Although the various National Salvation Associations Against Japan have been ordered to disband, Japanese goods are still slow to sell. The Soviet "Men Yu" fish sold by Anli Yanghang in this city is directly ordered from the Soviet government and does not go through any third party. The firm is deeply afraid of being misunderstood by all parties. It is reported that Mayor Wu Tiecheng and various commercial organizations in Shanghai have provided substantial proof.</p>
<h3>Docks in Hongkou Have Returned to Their Original State</h3>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese war, some dockworkers in the Hongkou area were unwilling to work due to fear of stray bullets. Recently, ships have been arriving and unloading cargo as usual, and the shipping schedule has not been affected in any way. Yesterday, someone inspected the Hongkou area for a week and saw that all kinds of ships were berthed in the Huangpu River, and the dockworkers were also very busy loading and unloading cargo. Since the lifting of martial law in the concession, night work has also resumed as before.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Bureau Negotiates with the French Concession Police</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the 20th of this month, Xu Huachun, a navigation police officer at the Jinliyuan China Merchants Bureau dock, was taken to the police station by the Xiaodongmen French Concession police for questioning while on duty at the floating dock, and then sent back, but his firearm was confiscated. It was found that the police officer had not crossed the boundary. It is suspected that the French police officer was newly transferred and did not know the boundary line. However, the Navigation Police Force of the Bureau has been established for nearly four years and has always protected merchants on ships and docks, and has never had any misunderstandings with the police. Because the location of the dock belongs to the water patrol area, and the boundary line with the concession is clear, the captain of the navigation police force, Liu Zhenqiao Songren, has reported to the head office and is negotiating with the French General Police Station to prevent similar incidents from happening again.</p>
<h3>A Thief Was Shot Dead in Guangxi Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Seriously Wounded</p>
<p>Apprentice Hit by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, accompanied by a female criminal, were traveling by car to the French Concession to arrest thieves. While passing near Yude Lane on Guangxi Road, the thief they wanted to arrest suddenly appeared. Detective Shao Jingfan and others immediately stopped the car and got out. The thief was surprised and fled into an alley in Yude Lane. The detectives chased after him, and the thief opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese and Western detectives also returned fire. Both sides exchanged more than twenty shots in the alley. The thief was hit by more than ten bullets and died on the spot. Detective Shao Huatan was also shot in the chest, left arm, and right leg, suffering serious injuries. A passerby was also hit and injured by a stray bullet. It is reported that the female criminal in the car was arrested by detectives from the Xinzha Police Station at the Xiaocai Market on Zhejiang Road at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. The thief who was shot dead was the female criminal's lover and was a member of the gang of 49 thieves recently tried by the First Special Court. Therefore, after the Xinzha Police Station arrested the female criminal, they took her to the French Concession to arrest accomplices. Unexpectedly, the thief came from the French Concession side at that time, passing through Guangxi Road, and was identified by the female criminal and killed on the spot. During the gun battle between the detectives and the thief, a stray bullet hit Pan Ruiqing, an apprentice carpenter from Lin Genji Woodworking Shop, in the right arm.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Due to Enmity Between Red Cross Members</h3>
<p>Xue Zhenyi Hates Hai Zongqi</p>
<p>Three Shots Fired, None Hit Hai</p>
<p>Three Passersby Hit by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>Xue Was Finally Arrested</p>
<p>Hai Zongqi, a Henan native, 32 years old, lives in the lower厢房 of No. 112 Bubenshi Road, French Concession. He is currently the captain of the First Brigade of the Red Cross. Xue Zhenyi (28 years old), from Xuzhou, is also a member of the Red Cross and also holds the position of deputy captain. Recently, Xue was reported by Hai for violating the regulations of the association and was dismissed. Xue hated Hai to the bone and repeatedly thought of revenge, but had no way to do it. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Xue secretly took a pistol and broke into Hai's bedroom. At that time, Hai had just put on his clothes and was leaving his bed. He caught sight of Xue coming and knew that something was wrong. He asked Xue what he wanted to do. Xue looked fierce and claimed that he needed to borrow 500 yuan for emergency needs. Hai was surprised to hear this and was about to answer when Xue suddenly fired his pistol and shot at Hai three times. Hai dodged in every possible way, and all three bullets hit the glass, sending shards flying. At that time, a tenant upstairs named Wan Yusi heard the sound and suspected it was a robbery, so he shouted for help. Xue saw that the situation was not good and quickly rushed out the door. Hai followed closely. At that time, the French Concession police inspectors Jin Jiulin, 目 Li 龍 Mao Jingen, and Zhang Ziying were passing by on patrol and helped chase after him. When they chased Xue to Beidi Alo Road, Xue turned around and fired several shots to resist arrest. Passersby Gu Fulin, Shen Ruijin, and a seven-year-old girl, Zhu Fuliang, were all injured by stray bullets. Xue fled across Fuxu Road to the intersection of Dagu Road and Chengdu Road. A Chinese police officer, No. 3126, from the Public Concession also joined the chase. As a result, Xue was finally intercepted and taken to the police station. After a detailed interrogation by the police chief, Xue confessed that he currently lived at No. 232 and a half, Rui'an Lane, Shanhai Road. On January 11th, 1928, he was sentenced to two years in prison by the French Court for theft. After being released from prison on January 11th, 1930, he served as a soldier in the 10th Division. In August of last year, he joined the Red Cross as a member. When the January 28th Incident occurred, he changed his position to the rescue team. He admitted to plotting to kill Hai without hesitation. The police chief ordered him to be detained and handed over to the court for strict punishment. The three people injured by stray bullets were temporarily sent to the hospital for treatment and will be investigated after they recover.</p>
<h3>The Trial of the Depositor's Appeal in the Ye Shantao Case of the Day and Night Bank Opens</h3>
<p>Ye Cannot Evade the Responsibility of a Director</p>
<p>After Huang Chuqiu, the founder of the Day and Night Bank, passed away in the winter of the year before last, the bank announced its liquidation. Subsequently, depositors such as Dong Longxing learned that Ye Shantao, who owned a wealth of real estate and was quite wealthy, was also one of the directors of the bank and should bear corresponding responsibility. Therefore, in the lawsuit, Ye was listed as a defendant. Ye, however, presented a letter signed by Huang Chuqiu allowing him to resign as a director, denying that he was still a director. However, Dong Longxing and others claimed that the letter was forged by Ye and filed a criminal self-accusation against Ye in the First Special District Local Court, demanding that he be punished for the crime of forging documents. After the trial, Ye Shantao was found not guilty. The plaintiffs were unwilling to accept this and hired lawyer Lu Qing to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating that the defendant presented a letter from Huang Chuqiu to Gan Yuesong as a rebuttal during the initial trial. However, the letter from Huang to Gan was an ordinary letter, which was far from the letter regarding the defendant's resignation as a director, and should not be treated the same. Moreover, after Huang Chuqiu's death, the defendant still served as a member of Huang's aftermath committee. The intention to cover up is quite obvious. During the initial trial, the appellant requested to verify the list of directors and the directors' transportation expenses of the Gongfa Company, which had been submitted to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, in order to clarify the facts, but it was not adopted. The initial trial summarily judged that Ye Shantao was not guilty, based on the statement that "the defendant presented a letter from Huang Chuqiu to Gan Yuesong and a letter to the defendant, and the跡象 were completely identical," regardless of the nature of the letter. The appellants were unable to accept this and specially filed an appeal, requesting the court to investigate and summon the defendant to court for interrogation, and to revoke the original judgment and punish the defendant for the crime he deserved. Yesterday, the Second Branch of the High Court, with Judge Yu presiding over the trial along with prosecutors Zhao and Guo, heard the case. The lawyer stated the appellant's intention and that the Day and Night Bank belonged to the Gongfa Company, and that the former French Concession Court had determined that the company was indeed a partnership and not a limited company, so shareholders and directors should bear unlimited liability. The defendant's lawyer, Lu Shaozong, claimed that Ye Shantao had also been implicated in the Gongfa lawsuit, but the French court had ruled that Ye was not related. Lawyer Yan continued that the letter was indeed forged by Ye and had no validity, and that Ye's submission of Huang's letter to Gan Yuesong did not conclusively prove anything, and requested that the Second Branch of the High Court obtain the Gongfa accounting books to prove that Ye had received transportation expenses as a director. The presiding judge then announced that the case would be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

After examining the body, they sat in court. First, the inspector reported on the investigation after the incident. Then, Wang's wife, Wang Gu's, submitted a statement claiming that her husband had been brutally shot to death and requested that the murderer be arrested and justice be done.

<h3>Russian Commits Suicide by Gas</h3>
<p>Result of a Marital Quarrel</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that a Russian named Niscorpo-Solovsov, residing at 146 Rue de la Sainte-Marie, was found suffocated by gas in his room at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Ni's death was apparently a suicide. Ni had been suffering from neurasthenia for several months and felt financially strained. Last Saturday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the couple quarreled again and physically fought quite violently. Afterward, Mrs. Ni took their four-month-old baby and returned to her mother's house. The next day, her father tried to call Ni to tell him to come and see the baby, but he could not get through. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Ni's wife went to Ni's place with her father, but there was no response when they knocked on the door. They then reported to the police, who opened the door and found that the room was filled with gas and Ni was dead. Several letters were left in the room, addressed to family members and the police, stating his intention to commit suicide. He also wrote to the gas company, stating that he borrowed gas to commit suicide and apologized for the loss to the company. Judging from the dates on the letters, it seems that Ni's death was still on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Robbery, Shooting, and Injury</h3>
<p>Gui Ahhuo, a Ningbo native residing at No. 272 Xingli Lane, Hongzhen, 34 years old, has been working as an accountant in a certain teahouse on Feihong Road.

Another robber was very angry at the sight and fired a shot, hitting Cai in the arm. The bullet passed through the front. Cai fell to the ground in pain, bleeding profusely. The robbers saw that they had caused a disaster and fled. Cai was taken to Tongren Hospital by her husband for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Press Union's Second Declaration on the Shishi Xinbao Incident</h3>
<p>Fellow compatriots, fellow workers everywhere, since April 2nd when the capitalists of the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao sealed off the workshop, expelled all the workers, and openly colluded with a small number of scabs to undermine our Press Union, it has been three weeks since the incident. During these three weeks, we have received sincere condolences and enthusiastic mediation from the postal service, distributors, and all walks of life. We have respected the wishes of the mediators and waited quietly for mediation, so our association has never wanted both parties to go to extremes, causing social unrest. We hoped that the Shishi Xinbao could restore the situation to at least what it was before April 2nd, so that a peaceful resolution could be reached and cooperation could resume as before. Who knew that the capitalists of the Shishi Xinbao, who had lost their conscience, not only showed no sincerity, but also intensified their actions. On the one hand, they used empty words to perfunctorily deal with mediation from all parties, and on the other hand, they sent a small number of scabs they raised to entice and threaten the poor and oppressed workers, causing some workers with weak wills to be bought off and forced to sign voluntary statements selling themselves, taking the opportunity to reduce the number of workers and increase the workload. What is even more distressing is that they instigated a small number of scabs in the factory to organize a so-called "Factory Maintenance Association" to implement the old tricks of exploitation and oppression, and published a despicable and shameless so-called "Comrade Public Announcement" in the newspaper, with all kinds of tricks to deceive the public. Alas, the methods of the Shishi Xinbao can be described as extremely despicable. Recently, we received the good intentions of a gentleman who came forward to mediate. Only yesterday were we able to hold a negotiation with Mr. Ren Jinping, the representative of the newspaper. Our association's attitude has always been calm and restrained. No matter what, we must restore the jobs of the hardworking workers who have served in the newspaper for many years, otherwise we would not care and would leave dozens of families to starve to death. How could we bear it? But Mr. Ren said that the newspaper's will was firm and that restoring the original state was impossible. After repeated consultations, no result could be achieved. Our association, on the one hand, was concerned about the suffering of the forced workers, and on the other hand, needed to explain the unreasonable situation to the newspaper, and even tried our best to tolerate and compromise, but failed to obtain the newspaper's understanding. Now, the forced workers are about to become paupers. Alas, can there be more cruel methods in the world than those of the Shishi Xinbao authorities? Since the establishment of our association to date, we have had five years of struggle history. In these five years, we have always taken labor-capital harmony as our association's motto, and there has never been such a socially alarming labor dispute. Unexpectedly, this time, the Shishi Xinbao thought that our忍 and 求全 could be deceived, and dared to肆意 destroy us regardless of everything. Our association tried our best to avoid conflict, but it was ineffective. However, the right and wrong of things will naturally be corrected by justice. We still hope that all fellow compatriots and workers across the country will give us impartial justice. Even if our association perishes because of the Shishi Xinbao, we can also complain. We declare again,</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Martyr Xiao De</h3>
<p>— By Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The people of the nation consider Xiao De to be a martyr. However, few know the anecdotes of the martyr's life. I will record one or two below. The martyr's name was Robert, and he was 26 years old. The outside world says 27, which is wrong. He was from Tacoma, Washington, USA. He loved flying since he was a child and often expressed his thoughts in toys. In his spare time, he would dismantle vacuum cleaners tirelessly, studying their assembly. He dismantled and reassembled them, like a little mechanic. The martyr saw aviation as the first joy in the world and loved airplanes very much. His mother sent him to the Keck Civil Aviation School to suit his personality. After graduation, he also studied military aviation. In the middle of the European War, he joined the Allied forces and made several contributions. In the spring of 1930, he left his mother and home and came to China from the United States. He stayed at No. 150 Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. He served as a pilot in the Aviation Department and a flying instructor at the Aviation School of the Ministry of Military Affairs. After coming to China, he had a full of enthusiasm and great hope. He wrote to his home country, often saying that the Chinese nation loves peace, is humble and polite, and he is happy in this land. Therefore, his mother repeatedly called him back, but he never did. The martyr was intelligent, loyal, brave, and fearless. He was an active member of the American Club and was highly respected. At the beginning of the Shanghai Incident, Japanese planes committed violence. The martyr was indignant and once made a bold statement to his Chinese friends: If I had ten fighter planes, I could drive away the Japanese planes, leaving no armor behind. However, this did not happen, and the martyr was disgruntled for ten days. On February 22, seeing the Japanese planes committing violence in Suzhou, driven by his conscience, he drove a light Boeing fighter plane alone and bravely eliminated the tyranny. He died in the wilderness due to the disparity in numbers. Alas.</p>
<h3>Peach Blossoms and Nameless Heroes</h3>
<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>The wandering train carried my drifting self back to Shanghai from the shores of West Lake, after suffering countless grievances and tasting full of pain. Occasionally, when I think back to the days before the [January 28th Incident], I vaguely feel as if it were another lifetime? When the train suddenly stopped at Longhua, the bright spring sunshine illuminated the peach blossoms of March, which were about to wither. A world of spring was just enough to brush away a bit of bitterness. However, although the spring breeze was so gentle, the fallen petals had long covered the ground. The deep red peach blossoms, in patches, lay on the soil like [mummies], causing people to recall the blood of countless nameless heroes and the struggles of the nation.</p>
<p>If it were not for the [January 28th Incident]'s disaster, which gave the numbed citizens of Shanghai a major shock, and awakened them with the clang of iron and the cry of blood... then I believe that every year, the spring outing ladies, with their carriages like flowing water and horses like dragons, would be jostling and crowding to wander and admire the countless peach blossom groves, with blood wheels smiling and cells smiling as they lingered, forgetting about the [September 18th Incident]? The roar of the storm is like the neighing of warhorses. Friends, if the hot blood in our hearts is still there, and our bones still remain, then we should understand that the radiant spring peach blossoms are about to wither away completely. To continue their charming beauty and the still-existing scenery of Jiangnan, it will depend on the sacrifices of nameless heroes.</p>
<p>The blood of nameless heroes is like the cold and emerald-green of the jasper peach's rouge. The jasper peach is coldly beautiful and lovely, but the blood is warm and moving. Spring has passed in such a way, gone amid the terror of artillery fire. Let our dear young friends close their eyes and think. The Nineteenth Route Army and all the brothers who resisted Japan, their blood is to exchange for the spring sunshine of our future, lying in the spring mud protecting the flowers, waiting for the returning swallows next year to report good news to them. In the future, we no longer want to see the frightening rouge on the lips of Shanghai ladies, we only wish that the young men would all become nameless heroes!</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Battle and Military Equipment (18)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Searchlights: In the early stages of the World War. Searchlights were used to detect aircraft in the air. At that time, they could only illuminate distances of sixty to ninety *li*. Thus, they did not achieve full effectiveness. By the mid-war period. Searchlights capable of illuminating distances of one hundred fifty *li*, or five or six *gan*, appeared. By 1924. A model with one hundred fifty *li* was invented. Its light source could be protected from the wind and could rotate automatically. Transportation and movement were also extremely convenient. The illumination distance reached six *gan*. Thus, there was no need to worry about night-time defense against enemy aircraft. I heard that the searchlights formerly equipped at the Wusong Fort and the Shizilin Fort could only illuminate three or four *li*. While those used on Japanese warships could reach six *li*. In addition, our army lacked anti-aircraft guns and long-range artillery. The sky was arbitrarily bombed by enemy aircraft. And the sea was unable to prevent enemy ships from advancing. Thinking of national defense. It is truly extremely heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Other equipment for transmitting information. Is the signal used between the air defense surveillance division and the defense headquarters. The relationship is particularly important. Because to prevent enemy aircraft from attacking, we must first pay attention to its actions. Conduct rigorous reconnaissance. If enemy aircraft are seen, regardless of distance, report to all parties immediately. And there must be no errors. For example, when reporting by telephone. Within twenty or thirty seconds. Clearly and accurately convey the information from the surveillance team to the headquarters. Then, there will be no delays. There are also siren devices used to transmit warnings. A Siren can release compressed air and steam to produce a loud sound. Reaching all parties. Recently, portable sirens have been used. In addition to air raid warnings. Infantry units also carry them. When we recall the situation of the Shanghai War this time. What the enemy relied on. Was only airplanes. What our army suffered most from. Was the lack of air force and air defense equipment. In the future, to prepare for the ravages of a great enemy. We must awaken attention to air defense. The most important thing in air defense. Is light control.</p>
<h3>Record of Military Life in Shuanglou (33)</h3>
<p>— Master Who Seeks Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Breaking off Friendship and Unfortunately Encountering a Bold Guest; Deciding on a Plan to Endure the Kindness of a Beauty. Speaking of An Yutian's pursuit and questioning of Wei Zhuomou. How could he see that his family's misfortune was caused by his paternal uncle, An Dakui, when his home had been robbed? Wei Zhuomou truthfully recounted all the details detailed in the letter from Mei Village's Mei Zike. It turned out that An Yutian's father was named An Dacheng. He had previously served as an official during the Qing Dynasty, filling several county positions. He accumulated some official wealth. In his old age, he retired to his fields. Because in this Anjia Village. He was considered a great gentry and a famous wealthy man. He was publicly elected as the village head of the entire village. In recent years, the local area has been very unstable. Banditry is rampant everywhere. The mountains are deep and the forests are dense there. The local customs are fierce and bold. And it has always been a gathering place for outlaws. In the area two or three hundred *li* around this Anjia Village. Gangs of bandits with a thousand or eight hundred men are considered large gangs. Gangs of one hundred or several dozen men are considered small gangs. It is already a common sight. Appearing and disappearing unpredictably. It is not considered any kind of rare event. It is only because Anjia Village has historically occupied a very advantageous position. The perimeter of a large village is about ten *li* long. Backed by mountains and close to water. A mud city was built. There is a village gate on each of the four sides, east, south, west, and north. Looking from afar, they are towering and majestic. Like city towers. The earthen gun emplacements are attached to the side of the village towers. Housing more than a dozen old-fashioned red-clad iron cannons. The remaining earthen walls have connected crenellations. Leaving countless gun holes. It is particularly in line with the semi-permanent fortification principles of the new military science. There is a small moat on the southeast side of the city. Connected to the village gate by a drawbridge. The northwest is surrounded by mountains. The terrain is strangely dangerous. The earthen wall snakes like a dragon. Built straight to the mountain peaks. The rear defense is even more solid. Originally, this type of fortress-style village. In their local area. Almost all famous villages and towns are built like this. If not, they cannot protect the peace of their village or town. Inevitably suffering from the attacks of foreign bandits. This has been the custom for a long time. It is the same everywhere. The large and small households in each village and town. As well as various industries and businesses. Must all gather in this type of earthen city with military defense equipment. Outside the city, there are only fields like clouds of paths. Strange and precipitous mountain peaks. And very few scattered dwellings of people. This Anjia Village of his is also the most famous large village. The area is wider than other small villages. The content is especially rich and substantial. In addition to An Dacheng's largest residence. There are still many other brick and tile buildings. Actually connected into one or two very prosperous market streets. Various goods gather. Trade travels through the village. Almost a small county town. Is not as bustling as this. Since it is so prosperous. It inevitably attracts the desires of nearby bandits. Therefore, since An Dacheng took office as village head. He has vigorously increased military preparations. To guard against emergencies. He specially collected a batch of public funds through public donations. Added many new-style firearms. Trained a militia team. Protecting Anjia Village even more like an iron bucket. Determined not to fear any more unexpected foreign attacks.</p>

Yuanmao, Yongxie, Xingyong, Zhongkang, and Dingchang sold. By 9:30, HSBC's listed rate increased by one point. English and American coins both rose by 25. But the internal market did not ease.

Because Yuanheng, Fuyu, Tong Taichang, Tianfeng, Yongyu, Hehong, Kangyong, Yuanyuan, Taifuxing, Yongda, and other groups resumed purchasing. Then English gold only settled at 125. And Mobil Oil Corporation settled forward American dollars at 5625 to 625. And Indian merchants sold near-term half-dollars to the central government. As a result, sentiment was particularly firm.

And Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Wupin, and Yuanheng tried hard to push up the price. At 11:40, it was at 14.5 *liang*. Suddenly dropping by 2.2 or 3 *liang*. Then retail investors sold. Closing out transactions. Which would be at 12.2 *liang*. Helplessly, sentiment was strong. Short sellers rushed to cover. Thus being controlled by multiple parties. By noon, it was at 14.2 *liang*. The closing price was 6.4 *liang* higher than the day before. A reversal after four consecutive days of declines. After the close, it continued to rise to more than 16 *liang*.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Securities and Bond Markets Continue to Decline Weaker</h3>
<p>Each Down by Around 7 or 8 *jiao*</p>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market conditions for various bonds on the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange continued to weaken compared to the previous day due to unfavorable diplomatic situations and the lack of a turning point in the overall situation. Each declining by around 7 or 8 *jiao*. The fluctuations continued to be moderate. And there were not many transactions. On the exchange, only 20,000 yuan was closed out. After continuous closing out of old futures transactions, there is currently a balance of only 4,625,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Trading Opens at 500 Bales</h3>
<p>Market Prices Drop Further by 5 *qian* to 1 *liang* or More</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market remained weak. The situation was weak. Actual sales also decreased. Various groups lacked long-term momentum. In reality, the economy was dried up. The situation was unstable. People's minds were difficult to settle. Therefore, selling prices gradually decreased. The trend of decline was drastic. With a great sense of worsening conditions. A portion of the Wuxi yarn factories, seeing the sluggishness of business in the interior, transported and sold their products to Shanghai one after another. As for the rumor of stopping night work, there is currently no need to implement it. Although the yarn price has fallen sharply in recent days. Calculating the cost still yields profits. There are about 10,000 bales of yarn stored in Xidi City. But there is another piece of news. There is a slight rumor overseas about purchasing this yarn. Probably also related to covering exchange transactions. Statistics showed that a total of 500 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day. Market prices fell by 5 *qian* to 1 *liang* or more. Customer groups from Sichuan purchased 300 bales, from the interior 35 bales, from Guangdong 10 bales, from Ningbo 16 bales, from Changsha 25 bales, from Jiangxi 5 bales, from the northern group 30 bales, and 80 bales were traded among peers. There were some new transactions open.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Factories Show No Buying Interest</h3>
<p>The cotton market was very weak. There were no actual sales transactions. Each factory had no buying intention. Because the yarn price was falling endlessly. And the May futures contract for American cotton also broke through the 6-cent mark. And there was a new low trend, causing the atmosphere to become even weaker. Factories showed even less intention to buy.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yarn Prices Decline Weaker</h3>
<p>The Tianjin yarn market was very weak. Sales were even more sluggish. The situation was relatively weak. Transactions remained quiet. The Botou group bought 16-count Changshou yarn at 157.5 *liang*. A price decrease of 5 *qian*. The Xianghe group bought 16-count Baxian yarn at 157 *liang*. The Tangshan group bought 16-count Samsung yarn at 157.5 *liang* to 158 *liang*.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Shows Divergent Trends Between England and America</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool. Later, it weakened due to profit-taking by long positions and selling by Japanese merchants. The futures market fell by 10 to 13 points. The spot market fell by 10 points. English cotton futures rose by four or five points. The spot market fell by two points. Egyptian cotton spot market rose five points. Indian cotton capped purchased May sold July. Pingle rose two rupees and the Bairo Creek rose four rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3>Grain Rivers Down Rice Market Sales Smoothly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of the various Shanghai South groups were few and far between, and the stocks in Pudong were also thin. City and rural stores, due to the sunny weather, interior merchants raised prices, and the psychology of the people turned tight and thick, and the market price increased by another 2 *jiao*. Both thin rice arrivals and accumulation were lacking, but inquiries were still enthusiastic, and the market shape jumped up by two or three *jiao*. Early rice and foreign Du Jian prices remained unchanged from the original market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources in Beishi were slightly less, and the stores lining the market were still enthusiastic. The stocks at the Suzhou River bottom were thinning day by day, and the arrivals at the end of the route were lacking. Prices gradually increased. Sources of Su, Chang, and North nonglutinous rice and early rice were scarce, and the price was three *jiao* higher than the previous two days. The price of Lu Yang Jian was more expensive by *jiao*.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Were Very Strong</h3>
<p>Various Rice Types Turned Stable After Weakness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the volume of foreign rice customer transactions was still weak, because the Hankou group had already handled a large batch,</p>
<p>and the appetite turned dull. Other groups showed no prospect of moving. In the morning, there was already a downward trend. In the afternoon, there was suddenly a rush of local purchases and purchases by national and Hankou customers, and the market immediately turned around. Statistics showed that more than 13,000 bags of small glutinous rice were opened at a price of 9.75 to 10 yuan, red rice at 9.47 yuan, and Min Dang at 200 bags at a price of 10.028 yuan. No one inquired about forward rice, and the downstream price was four or five points lower. Statistics showed that 300 tons of four and five-month small glutinous rice were opened.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Gradually Softened</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market conditions continued to show a downward trend. Because actual sales and inventory continued to be observed, foreign wheat reports also showed a continuous decline. However, the biggest main reason was actually the impact of tight money. Except for urgent shipments, customers did not have the intention to purchase in bulk, so it was difficult for those in the market who wanted to sell to find their masters. In terms of factories, the major factories also naturally loosened due to the long-term relationship at the end of April. Therefore, the spot chips for April gradually softened from the opening price to the closing price, finally reaching 2.097 *fen*, while the price for May was 2 or 3 *fen* higher than the previous week. Recently, due to the willingness of factories to open and the weakness of psychology, the downward trend was also more drastic, and finally it also reached 2.102 *fen*, which was a decrease of 1.25 *fen* for April and 1.75 *fen* for May compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Hardware - Small Nails Were Scarce and Prices Were High</h3>
<p>Because small nails were unusually scarce in the market, and various groups were actively requesting them, the market conditions were lively, and because the standard supply could not meet demand, it went straight up step by step. The current market price for 3-point nails is 12.25 taels, 4-point and 5-point nails are 12.5 taels, and 6-point nails are 12 taels. It was said that Japanese customers sold more than 400 barrels yesterday.</p>
<h3>Black Sheet Sales Declining</h3>
<p>The sales of black sheets have recently reached the declining season, so the market is extremely quiet, and the standard is not very firm. The current market price is 8.75 taels per load for 26-inch sheets, and 8.6 taels for 36-inch sheets. In addition to a slight embellishment from the Tianjin group, no other group inquired about transactions. According to the recent observations of the general public, the future market conditions may still decline slightly.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Foreign Silk Firms Completely Suspended Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market became increasingly sluggish. Because overseas Chinese silk opening prices plummeted, the capital losses of each factory were even greater, reaching 300-400 taels per package. Chinese and foreign parties mutually resisted, and silk sales completely stopped. Although yesterday was Saturday, only the market in the morning was open, and no transactions of yellow, white, or gray silk were heard, and Chinese silk merchants were in dire straits.</p>
<h3>Qi Li Silk Reeled Silk Was Transported to Shanghai in Its Entirety</h3>
<p>More than 200 Packages Arrived in the Last Few Days</p>
<p>In the areas of Nanxun in the Lake District, the spring silkworm season has started, and farmers are engaged in silkworm breeding. Each silk firm is actively transporting the Qi Li silk reeled silk that they have in stock to Shanghai. In the last few days, the Shanghai-Hangzhou trains and Shanghai-Lake shuttle boats have transported a total of 287 packages of Qi Li dried large silk reeled silk, and the silk in stock at the origin has been shipped in its entirety.</p>
<h3>Scattered Piece Goods and Woolen Cloth Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen cloth transactions were scattered and slow, and commodity prices remained weak. Wholesale business was very small, and those that were opened were only scattered businesses of half a bolt or one bolt. There were also transactions by Western-style tailors, with single-sided open-water American raincoat cloth, striped solid-colored overcoat flannel, medium-thick flannel, silk-gloss striped Baleni and other types being purchased more strongly, and they had reached actual sales.</p>

<h3>The Value of Xiao De's Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Gou</p>
<p>When Xiao De died a martyr in Suzhou, I originally intended to write something to express the pain of Xiao De's passing and the greatness of his righteous heroism. However, overwhelmed with emotion and shame, my ink mixed with tears, and I could not write a single word.</p>
<p>Today is the day of Xiao De's public burial. The Xiao De Righteous Martyr Commemoration Committee has made every effort to prepare a grand ceremony to bury him near the Hongqiao Airport to comfort the spirit of Xiao De, the righteous martyr. How could I not say a word to express my condolences and admiration?</p>
<p>Xiao De's sacrifice in Suzhou this time, resisting Japanese aircraft and giving his life, cannot be regarded as merely an ordinary sacrifice due to the war. Xiao De was not acting under the mission of the American government to resist Japan, nor was he acting under the mission of the Chinese government to ask Xiao De to resist Japan. Xiao De's sacrifice this time was entirely his own. Seeing the violent acts of the Japanese army, throwing bombs everywhere and trampling on our people, Xiao De sacrificed purely for world justice and for humanity. This is indeed clear evidence.</p>
<p>Xiao De was an American citizen and had no connection with our country. The Japanese invasion of China had even less to do with Xiao De. However, Xiao De, seeing what was right and acting bravely, disregarded everything and fought bravely against the Japanese aircraft. His courage and determination are commendable. One drop of Xiao De's blood can spread throughout the world, cultivating the flowers of justice and nourishing the fruits of public reason, extending infinitely in all directions, forever shining and indelible.</p>
<p>Therefore, Xiao De's mother said that she had no regrets about the death of her eldest son in China, because he died for international justice and his death was an honor. Indeed, everyone must die, but Xiao De's death is the most meaningful and valuable. Xiao De is not only a righteous man of our country, but also a righteous man of the world, not only a righteous man of the world, but also a model for all mankind. Xiao De's mother has a good son. Here, I respectfully wish the spirit of Xiao De, the righteous martyr, in heaven.</p>
<p>Xiao De sacrificed for world justice and can indeed receive the respect and worship of all our people without shame. However, I wonder what the general traitors who are corrupt officials, the奸商(jian shang) blinded by profit, and the armed classes who embrace non-resistance will think when they see this. What is strange is that when Xiao De's mother arrived in Shanghai, the Americans in Shanghai showed no reaction. Is it because they think that world affairs are not important enough? Alas!</p>

<h3>Ode to Captain Xiao De's Monument</h3>
<p>— Meng Tiao Zhu</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang has already written a biography of Captain Xiao De's death. Now that Xiao De's mother has come to Shanghai to bury Captain Xiao De's remains at Hongqiao Airport, and various sectors have proposed erecting a monument to Captain Xiao De, I hereby compose this ode to promote its completion.</p>
<p>Thunder and rain seem to convey the urgency of battle, spirits flicker as a lofty monument rises. Towering above the clouds, his bones form a tomb, four hundred million people weep in the rain. At that time, enemy planes came over the river, the killing intent penetrated the blue sky. Innumerable iron bombs were thrown, and the houses below were reduced to flying ash. You, sir, rose up courageously, asking, "What kind of vile creature dares to do this?" The fierce tiger actually flew on wings, "Am I the only one who can bear to sit and watch?" Riding a flying chariot, you pursued the enemy, the enemy's courage failed, and the heavens were astonished. The wind and clouds were trampled upon as you engaged in fierce battle, the mountains shook and the silver sea dazzled. Star officials and flying generals descended from the sky, lightning flashed over the city of Helu. Enemy planes attacked in interlocking formations, how could one plane calmly respond? In an instant, flames annihilated one enemy, and you too were pierced through the chest by a single bullet. The candle dragon fell from the thirty-third heaven, the loyal soul and heroic spirit shattered like glass. Alas, for whom did you die? You sacrificed your life only for justice. Your death is relevant to all living beings; Hua De and Gordon are not worthy of comparison. Your heroic spirit transformed into a rainbow that stretches for thousands of feet, a single rock is enough to be admired. Even now, thunder resounds in the sky of Wu, and spiritual flags and armored horses still come and go. I write a eulogy for your monument, the three words to be engraved are "Peace Monument," one.</p>

<h3>Torpedoes</h3>
<p>— Xia Ren</p>
<p>Torpedoes are the only effective weapon for bombing warships. They are named for their resemblance to large fish. The head and tail are conical, and the middle is cylindrical, in order to reduce water resistance. The propeller and rudder are at the end, enabling it to move forward automatically in the water, or to be controlled according to a predetermined distance. Recently, they can travel up to 10,000 meters, but the effective range of hitting the target is only about 3,000 meters. In combat, they can be submerged about two feet below the surface of the water so that they are not easily detected by enemy ships. Their value is about nine thousand or more yuan.</p>
<p>Torpedoes were invented in 1866, and the German Whitehead is considered the best. It is fourteen inches in diameter, eleven feet long, weighs three hundred pounds, and contains twenty pounds of explosives. The air pressure of the original power source is 370 pounds per square inch, and the speed is seven knots (now increased to twenty inches in diameter and can hold hundreds of pounds of explosives). It can hit a ship at anchor 400 yards away, and a giant ship underway 200 yards away. At that time, Britain and the United States competed to buy its secrets, not hesitating to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, but ultimately failed to obtain the German secrets. Therefore, during the European War, Germany used this as the only weapon to defeat the British Navy. The British Navy was blockaded and dared not cross the Lei Pool. The United States joined the Allied Powers because German submarines, disregarding good faith, often used this as an excuse to bomb its merchant ships.</p>
<p>Since then, it has gradually been improved, and a rotary machine has been invented to control its direction, applying the principle of hammer inertia to improve the depth adjustment, and the steel air chamber has been changed to increase the air pressure. All these things cannot be manufactured by our country's military industry. Its structure is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The head, also known as the warhead, is the chamber for explosives, occupying about a quarter of the total length. It contains a firing pin and a detonator. There are four impellers in the front, which rotate due to water resistance. When a certain distance is reached, the firing pin strikes the detonator to cause the explosion of the explosives. Wet guncotton is used for the explosives, for its safety and strong explosive power. Recently, trilite and similar substances have been used, which are even better because they do not lose their effectiveness even after being immersed in water for several years, and their specific gravity is very large to make up for the lack of explosive power. According to test results, a pressure of 12,000 pounds per square inch on a double-bottomed warship can completely break it. Even if it explodes four feet below the surface of the water, warships twenty feet away will be its victims. When performing exercises, the warhead can be removed and replaced with a dummy head to measure its progress, rocking and depth recording.</p>
<p>(2) The air chamber, occupying half of the total length, is used to store the compressed air of the original power source, about 150 atmospheres. The material must be strong and the work is very important. Its cost accounts for about one-half of the total.</p>
<p>(3) The balance chamber is where the depth adjuster is installed. It has a pendulum and a water pressure plate, which vibrate due to the wave shape. The pendulum swings due to the inclination, and the two interact to control the horizontal rudder.</p>
<p>(4) The engine room is divided into three parts: the engine, the pressure reducing engine, and the steering engine.</p>
<p>(5) The engine mostly uses the Pula-Chahudo cylinder type. The axle passes through the center of the floating chamber to the tail to connect to the two propellers. The compressed air of the original power source is reduced from 150 atmospheres to 30 atmospheres by the pressure reducing valve and enters the engine to start it.</p>
<p>(6) The floating chamber is equipped with a vertical rudder and steering engine to control the left and right deviation of the torpedo.</p>
<p>(7) The car room is equipped with bevel gears to transmit the rotary motion of the engine shaft to the two propellers that react with each other.</p>
<p>(8) The torpedo launch tube, uses gunpowder or compressed air to launch it. The film in the launch tube then causes the torpedo to start and opens the air pipe. Then, air rushes into the various mechanisms and starts the adjusting effect. However, the shaking of the warship has a great impact during launch, and the shaking is often uncontrollable by human power and can reduce the accuracy of the torpedo.</p>

<h3>Typical Characters</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The strong electric light shone through the light blue lampshade, illuminating the magnificent living room like a snowy field. Distinguished guests were being lavishly entertained by the host. The lingering aroma of superior cigars filled the room.</p>
<p>"China is truly amazing, and Shanghai has truly become a free city. Then, we will all be..." the guest said with a hint of emotion.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, but China is too weak and will never be able to do well. Isn't that right, old friend?" This was the host's smiling reply.</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly! China is simply too big.</p>
<p>Even if Manchuria were not taken by Japan, it would be seized by Red Russia. Then, rather than letting the Russians communize it, it would be better to let a country with a similar culture coexist and prosper with us."</p>
<p>"That's right! Exactly like that!"</p>
<p>"I heard that the government is going to rely on you again to preside over the finances?"</p>
<p>"Hahaha, there is indeed such news. But you have to treat this specially, old friend," the host said with another complacent laugh.</p>
<p>"Easy to say, easy to say. We're all family. As long as the brothers can continue to operate in the banking sector, we will do our best to help."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, as the saying goes, 'everyone eats together,' hahaha..."</p>
<p>The sound of mahjong upstairs suddenly stopped, followed by the host's fourth concubine ordering the maid to prepare face water. This made the host very anxious, because it was now time to accompany the fourth concubine to the __ restaurant, so he couldn't help but look troubled and hesitant. Of course, the clever guest was able to understand immediately, cupped his hands, and took his leave with profuse thanks. A moment later, the roar of a car starting its engine was heard in front of the door.</p>
<p>In the house, the host stared at his darling carefully painting her eyebrows, and also surreptitiously pinched her waist while taking a brand new nightgown from the flirtatious maid's hand, and she couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You're stealing chicken again?" This was the concubine's __娇.</p>
<p>"Nothing... Hurry up and get dressed, or we'll be late."</p>
<p>Half an hour later, they were immersed in the warm spring and peaceful, free night air after the war.</p>

<h3>The Fate of Dong Shi</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>The afterglow of the setting sun reflected off the corner of the building, dazzlingly dyeing it a reddish-orange color. The gentle breeze blew constantly, and the bustling people wore light clothing to resist the heat bestowed by the season.</p>
<p>In an instant, the afterglow disappeared, and only the scattered electric lights in the urban twilight flickered and illuminated, stirred by the breeze. At this time, in the so-called city center, the flow of people seemed even greater. Some were swallowed into the __楼 or __酒家, some were watching outside the brightly lit glass windows, some were lingering in front of the consignment shops, and some were strolling around aimlessly... Due to the different situations, complex and noisy tones were formed.</p>
<p>"Old Wang, isn't that __路? Hey! The fairies on this road are the most famous."</p>
<p>"Hmph! Forget it, where would there be fairies there? At most, they're just earthly immortals."</p>
<p>"You always affirm things haphazardly without regard for the facts."</p>
<p>"What? You..."</p>
<p>A woman brushed past them.</p>
<p>"Hey! Did you see that? That fat woman?" A Zhu nudged Old Wang with his elbow.</p>
<p>"You're too useless, you're simply like a blind man eating crabs, only knowing that they're good."</p>
<p>After crossing the intersection, on the edge of the sidewalk outside a small alley, a group of women dressed in brightly colored clothes were arranged. Although the light outside the alley was somewhat dim, it could not hinder the delicate whiteness of their faces. "Wang, Wang..." As they passed by them, A Zhu looked straight ahead and whispered.</p>
<p>"Go, go, Dong Shi has opened her mouth."</p>
<p>A Zhu didn't show any reaction, no, perhaps he forgot to react, and continued to stare. Then, they knew, they knew that this was the long-awaited destination that had arrived today, and they rushed up without hesitation.</p>
<p>In the flickering of the dim light, they saw their backs surrounded by several people, being pushed forward as if being tied to the execution ground, disappearing into the narrow alley.</p>
