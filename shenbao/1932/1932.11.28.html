<h3>國內國外上海</h3>
<p>鄧劉田成立同盟各方布置攻守軍事韓復榘出巡魯西各縣熊斌返京府令嘉獎行都各機關出力人員</p>
<p>日本擬提减軍新計劃英皇任命布克萊爲南愛新總督察勘堤工委員開始視察毛光翔猶國才電告進佔貴陽王家烈逃許世英等電請定期實行路電附加振捐</p>
<p>日本减軍新計劃</p>
<h3>希圖握東亞覇權</h3>
<p>要求英美日主力艦實際均等推翻華會所定五五三之比率并拒絶胡佛普減三分之計劃</p>
<p>一方提議廢除飛機母艦一方趕速改設飛機母艦</p>
<h3>軍縮會議又增一重大糾紛</h3>
<p>日內瓦日本新擬一海軍裁减計劃、大約將於下星期內、送　軍縮會議技術委員會、其內容㈠要求英美日三國主力艦實際之均等、取　華會所定力五三比例、㈡拒絶美國胡佛總統普减三分之一計劃提　英美各犧牲主力艦五艘日本　僅犧牲主力艦一艘、但在相當讓步之交換條件中、日本亦可犧牲主力艦兩艘、㈢此外再根據各國地理上需、要締結軍縮條約、使華會議定之一九三五年軍縮會議無召集之必要、</p>
<p>日本拒絶美總統胡佛計劃之理由、以爲海陸軍普减三分之一後、將使强國益强、弱國益弱胡佛計劃、乃純粹縱量之軍縮、七月間日内瓦會議時、曾在决議案内宣稱、侵略軍器、應减縮至最少限度、俾可增加防衛軍器之效能、胡佛計劃、未免完全漠視此點故日本提議、根據此基本見則、締結軍縮新約、使華會所定　九三五年會議、無召集之必要、</p>
<p>至防衛軍器之分配、日本計劃内、將詳細叙述、大致主張　國議就其地理需要及其他份子、完密考慮後、恨據實在需要、保持　防衛機關、</p>
<p>潛斑爲防衛武器之一、故有絶對之需要、惟其最大噸數、（每隻噸數）或可恊定減低、倫敦條約會許每艇最大噸數、可達二千噸、日本雖不主張再行縮小、但亦認爲未　無減削之可能</p>
<p>再擬廢除飛機母艦、並禁止一切巡洋艦上携帶飛機、按華會中限定飛機母艦最大不得過一萬七千噸、今日本則主張槪予廢除、又華會規定主力艦、最大限三萬五千噸、日本　提議最大不得逾二萬五千噸、同時艦上大硫口後、亦應由華會所許之十六吋減爲十四吋、</p>
<p>至主力艦之數目、亦可在根據國防需要之軍需協定下、酌量減少、建議英美兩國主力艦、可由十五艘減爲十艘、日本主力艦由九艘減爲八艘、但若日本獲得某種讓步後、其主力艘亦可限爲七艘、</p>
<p>按華軍軍縮條約、係一九二二年二月六日簽訂、受其限制最甚者、厥爲主力艦、因當時會中商定、以主力艦之數目、作爲各國海軍力之根據、並是英美日三國海軍、遂規定作五五三之比率、日本雖竭力反對、卒屈於英美、該約又規定至一九三六年十一月三十一日滿期、此後繼續與否、當於滿期前二年通知、其意義不啻自働規定九三五年春間、須再行集會　次、自此約成立、遂有四國公約與九國公約之簽訂、今日本之新計劃、似欲請求重行考慮日本在遠東之地位、要求與英美均等之比率、説者以爲若允許日人要求後、無異公認其握亞洲之覇權云、（一十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>東京日海軍當局鑑於海軍飛機母艦能登呂號在滬戰之能力、殊覺於將來海戰增加此種特務艦之必要、於是决定將特務艦神威號（　萬七千噸）改爲飛機艦母艦、已由浦賀造艦所進行改修工作、豫定年一月告竣、即編入第二遣外艦隊、警備北華海岸、（二十七日日聯社電）</p>

<h3>日政府回訓到日内瓦令松岡堅持和解辦法反對援用盟約十五章</h3>
<p>日内瓦國聯行政院會議明日可結束、同時即將中日問題　交大會討論、日外務省對松岡等請示之回訓、亦於二十六日晚七時到日内瓦代表部、松岡即於今晨召集長岡·佐籐·兩代表開會、依照外務省所示訓令、討論應付國聯大會第一步之方策、結果以爲日本在國聯難關仍在小國代表方面、故擬竭力向諸小國運動、以謀護得意外之效果、故松岡等將進行向小國中唯有力之捷克代表、積極設法運動、至其效果若何則難預料、現日外務省對此甚爲注意、（二十七日遠東社電）</p>
<p>東京日政府因鑑於滿洲問題移交大會討論、則國聯對日形勢終斃免不利、現雖以脫離國聯爲恫嚇、但日政府、部份已漸覺此種空誠計未必於日有效、故擬謀種彌縫補救方法、日來東京及日内瓦日代表部内均發出、種官傳、謂某大國對滿洲問題意見、已漸覺依賴國聯、實終不得解决、仍須由中日兩國直接交涉方有效等空氣、此善示在無可如何中、作無聊宣傳以自慰也（二十七日遠東社電）</p>
<p>東京國聯理事會寗議中日問題情形漸次惡化、又轉交大大會討論問題亦已確定、外務省以爲前途不許樂觀、本日雖爲星期日、谷亞洲局長·守島第一課長等出席外務省、對於日内瓦日代表團訓令日代表應取態度、其内容命日代表在二十八日上午十、時理事會反對依據會章第十五條之大會召開事宜、當理事會移交大會討論時、則聲明保留出席會議、並關於如下諸點、極力主張日本方針、國聯應以政治的解决一切國聯爭執、爲其主要使命故理事會將中日問題移交大會時、不能放任問題、須要保持於必要時干涉此問題又命松岡代表根基於政府訓令、將於二十八日之理事會主張如次三點、以闡明日政府之立揚、㈠日本反對將滿洲問題移交依據第十五條召開之臨時大會、㈡日本代表出席大會之唯一目的、爲說明日政府之立塲、滿洲問題應由理事會審議之見解、始終不能改愼、㈢國聯　提用會章第十一條、以和協手段解决滿洲問題、第十五條第一至第三項、與第十一條相同、規定以和協手段解决、故日本並無異議、但第四項以下之提　、因有壓迫的或强制的處理、日政府　乎反對其一切辦法（二十七日日聯社電）</p>

<h3>財政將瀕危機</h3>
<p>美人白森之觀察</p>
<p>紐約美要人白森今日在紐約外交政策討論會演說稱、日本帝國政府明年即不致於失敗、亦將受重大打擊、因滿洲迅將成爲日人經濟上重大負擔、今已昭然若揭日人欲在滿安輯人民、緩靖地方、雖支出無數金錢、迄今未能成功、此時日本正竭蹶支持其軍事機關之重大負擔、惟究竟可免　躓與否、將視目前軍事冒險之成敗　爲斷、又謂中國亦有　重之政治財政問題、苟未能亟謀救濟、亦將受重大打擊云、（二十六日國民社電）</p>

<h3>評論中日爭案</h3>
<p>倫敦倫敦觀察報今日批評、謂日内瓦一週辯論之結果、惡劣已極當局者似猶未命其危機、該報呵斥西歐評論之輕躁、謂要求對日戰爭以維護國聯盟約者、乃此盟約之最大仇敵、又謂避免戰爭及一般災禍之唯一方法、在對雙方表示忍耐的同情耳、據該報俄京訪電、如日本不得志於日内瓦、則俄日協定或將成立、而涉及「滿洲國」之承認、亦或涉及俄滿不侵略條約、俄報詳載日内瓦會議之情形、但不著批評、旣未贊助中國之要求、亦未歡迎顧博士關於田中奏章之言論云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>柏林德國伏錫志報今日批評國聯行政院院會議謂英國現亦織其政策、在種種機會中、表示英日之友誼、較諸滿洲問題之公正解决更爲重要、唯一國家之眞欲决定滿洲問題者厥爲美國需美國恐凱洛格非戰公約一經破壞、則各種和平擔保、悉成幻夢也（二十六日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>堤工落成感言誠</h3>
<p>去年洪水成災沿江各省之堤防及水利工程全部潰决水勢所至大地陸沉國府救濟水災委員會爲謀根本之救濟除一面辦理急賑外同時并以工賑辦法修復各段堤工目前工程告竣吾人週顧去年巨浪拍天人畜同歸於盡之慘毒情狀今目覩此偉大之水利工程告厥成功殊不能不謂爲一極堪慶幸之事</p>
<p>曩昔吾人數述我國内之偉大建築輒推萬里長城實則長城之功用在秦代亦止於防胡降至近世其功用及愈不可見而其積平民之血肉建築捍衛「一家天下」之堡壘企圖以此保持其子孫萬世之業則尤不能逃千萬後世之責備乃若此次之水利工程綿亘四千三百九十餘公里輕歷六省區之揚子江漠江湘沅淮河運河裏下河河洛諸流域其工程之偉大旣不亞於長城而其爲沿江數千萬人民所依賴以生存功效之宏大尤顯非一家之長城所可相提並論今歳夏秋之交水勢又大但竟未至成災者此數千里水利工程功效之偉大更顯然可見蓋以工代賑不僅使萬千僵臥待死依賑爲活之災黎得有一以自力謀自救之機會而使從前斷續之堤工以統一之計劃打成一片其收效自至爲宏大曩昔一遇災荒吾人徒知着目於「賑」以此次工賑之敎訓吾人今後又當了然於救災之道僅在於「賑」而尤在於「工」矣</p>
<p>水災會以此次鉅工告成特邀請滬上各界人士於今日在京參加堤工落成典禮而後親臨各工程區域次第察勘水災會鉅大之費用大抵都來自社會之捐輪際茲鉅工告成曩日之熱心捐輪者親臨勘察復克目擊其所輪將已積而爲偉大之功程並未虚擲惟是吾人認爲茲事極關重大而在大劫之後國難期間能有此偉大之建設其意義尤爲深長故水災會此次邀請各界勘察其用意當不在於誇示其勞績而應邀前往勘察者其意義亦不同於普通之游覽吾人即謂應邀勘察者此行深關乎今後長江流域諸省之水利與民生亦不爲過</p>
<p>吾人認爲滾滾江流兩岸皆爲沃壤假如灌漑得宜防堤有道則此滾滾者皆足以幅國利民夫惟灌漑無方甚至無水利工程可言乃致去年水災綜合被災面積而言受害最重區域逹廿六萬五千平方里較輕者亦在六萬方里左右約當英之英格蘭美之紐約省受災人口更至少亦有五千萬人無家可歸世界各國地勢低於水面者大抵皆以注重水利之故得以免災獨有我國洪水一至惟有束手待死吾人迥念去年舉國沉溺之慘狀猶不能不爲之流涙今日堤工雖旣已告成吾人得稍有屏障但吾人仍不能存「一勞即可永逸」之觀念以爲今後已有所恃而無恐蓋築堤固難而防堤亦殊不易築堤固爲急務防堤亦爲要圖築而不防與不善爲守護則三兩年後由於自然之侵蝕堤工又將不堪設想故此後更當於如何永久維護堤工與如何利用堤工兩問題加以縝密之研究蓋惟能利用堤岸庶堤工不至荒廢能維護堤工庶此次偉大之工程可以永埀於久遠</p>
<p>吾人深幸此次鉅大工程之告成謹更以此意向政府當局及應邀勘察　君敬致殷切之祝望</p>
<h3>法俄締結不侵犯條約成功</h3>

<p>哈瓦斯二十六日巴黎電法國　蘇俄兩國所訂之互不侵犯條約、已於上年八月二十四日由法國外交部秘書長及蘇俄駐法大使暫書草押、今晨總理赫理歐特將此約提出國務會議討論該約首列引言、聲明本約保障國聯會盟約、並重行承認巴黎非戰公約、引言以下共有條文七欵規定互不侵犯之諾言不僅適用於法國及其殖民地、即法國保護地及法國受國聯委任統治之地方、亦均包括在内、其次規定凡屬財政上及經濟上之排斥、以及由政治上及社會上妨害他國之宣傳行爲、兩國互相加以禁止、又締約一國不得緃容以武力攻擊他締約國爲目的之任何軍事團體在其境内存在、再次規定在法國境内之俄國人民智識團體及互助團體得繼續享受、切因政治問題而流亡在外國者所享受之保護此項互不侵犯條約、係仿照德俄條約原文而加以改善、不侵犯條約内並包含一種和解條約、其原因由於蘇俄因政體不同之關係、不願承認仲裁制度、而欲以兩國間所能發生之爭端、提交和解機關以審查之、此項機關有各種職權、其中重要者爲任命專家及向各關係國政府提出建議、其性質與一九一零年以後美國尙未承認仲裁原則時所組織之樸萊因委員團相似、按法國與蘇俄尙須進行商務談判、此項互不侵犯條約、不日簽字一層、不致妨害商務談判之成功、蓋政治商務兩種問題若互相牽涉、則對於各個問題之各項要素、不易得到精確之認識帮分别談判以免此弊、法俄兩國一方簽訂互不侵犯條約、方進行商務談判、將兩事完全分開、其意在此現在政治問題旣已得到解决、此後即易集中精神從事商務談判矣、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十六日巴黎電法俄兩國互不侵犯條約、已於今晨在國務會議中通過、自一九二二年以來、歐洲大部份國家陸續進行談判、商訂互不侵犯條約、法國條約之訂立、不啻爲此種談判作一結束而歐洲「不侵犯條約」之政策、亦告歐成功、查一九二五年至一九二七年之間、莫斯科政府曾與土耳其·　國·阿富汗·立陶宛·波斯等國、先後訂立友好條約或互不侵犯條約、此外蘇俄又以非戰公約、須經過長時間之後始能實行、故於一九二八年向隣近各國、建議締結　種特别條約、由簽字各國相約實行巴黎非戰公約、一九二九年蘇俄·波蘭·羅馬尼亞及波羅的海各國、在莫斯科實行簽訂此項特别條約、一九三零年蘇俄政府又表示願與波蘭及法國締結一種特别條約、旋即進行談判、結果一九三二年初與芬蘭愛沙尼亞及拉達維亞簽訂互不侵犯條約、並予以批准、一九三二年一月、波蘭將其對俄之互不侵犯條約暫書草押、至七月正式簽字、但不即時批准、俾羅馬尼亞有相當時間、與蘇俄商訂同様條約、但羅馬尼亞因卑撒拉比省領士之爭執問題與蘇俄談判未能成功、羅國外長蒂杜樓斯哥對羅國議會宣言、羅國仍　望其同盟國能照預定計畫、與蘇俄簽訂互不侵犯條約、因此法國總理赫禮歐認爲法國與蘇俄互不侵犯條約已書草押者、此時似應提出正式簽字、而不可再行延擱、且蘇俄對法國政府宣言、採取一種諒解政策、在對羅馬尼亞之爭執問題中、并不用暴力以解决之、故法國對於不侵犯條約、尤有簽字之必要、羅外長同一宣言中、並請法國爲羅馬尼亞斡旋、使蘇俄允許由法俄條約簽字之日起、以四個月爲限、以便羅國按照蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫與羅國駐巴尼公使加德爾所商定之綦礎、與蘇俄簽訂互不侵犯條約、歐洲廣大部份之國家、爲建設和平而進行之多次談判、至是已告一結束矣、吾人尙憶截至目下爲止、　俄與歐洲大國問簽訂之政治條約、僅有一種、即德俄一九二二年拉巴羅條約成立後兩國間所訂之柏林條約、（一九二六年）是也、柏林之約、係規定德國被攻擊時、俄守中立、此次法俄之約、爲法國如被攻擊、則俄守中立前後兩約互相補助、又可爲歐洲多增一層信用及保障、觀于此點、則法俄互不侵犯條約之重要、可想見矣、</p>
<p>羅國放棄與俄訂約</p>
<h3>波俄條約亦將批准</h3>
<p>哈瓦科二十六日巴黎電頃悉波蘭政府、定於明日將波俄互不侵犯條約予以批准、又羅馬尼亞業已放棄與蘇俄簽訂互不侵犯條約之意、爲力求補救起見、蘇聯徇法國政府之請、將在上述兩種條約之外、另附特别宣言書一件云、</p>

<h3>戰時之隱身術</h3>
<p>利用光學發明鋼甲</p>
<p>西班牙工程師四年研究之成績</p>
<p>哈瓦斯廿七日瑪德里電民聲報載工程師奥美特之新發明、行將正式試騐、此項發明係一鋼甲、可使兵士不爲敵人所見、其法用一鏡、按照一定角度、置於欲藏匿之兵或械之前此鏡將地上之一部映現於鏡前、使敵人祗見一片土地、而不見匿在鏡後之兵或械、據奥美特稱費四年之硏究始得此結果、因感於某種動物之具有摹仿能力、如變色蜥蜴之類、故有此發明云、</p>

<h3>討論戰債問題</h3>
<p>對美覆文在起草中</p>
<p>詳述申請緩付理由</p>
<p>法比亦均表示</p>
<p>無力繳付到期美債</p>
<p>路透社二十六日倫敦電内閣大約將於星期一日開會討論戰債問題、首相麥唐納明日將先與外相西門財相張伯倫作非正式之談話、據可靠方面消息、英國覆文草稿明日可交首相審閱、文内將詳述英國緩付十二月到期債欵、以準備修正戰債全部之理由、如大西洋對面之戰債問題、不先作研究、則事實將促迫賠欵問題與戰債問題重加討論、而發生　認洛桑會議所已銷除之禍害與不測之變動、其結果將令全世界商業之恢復因以延緩云云、昨日張伯倫聲稱、在此第二牒文中、英國將詳述所以申請緩付之理由、按胡佛總統曾承認申請自由討論債務問題、實爲適合情理之舉故胡氏顯不反對用以使戰債復成談話問題之方法、張伯倫對於此點、特表示滿意、至於美國國會對緩付下月債欵問題、或對更大債務本身</p>
<h3>汽車大王患疝</h3>
<p>路透社二十六日地特羅伊電汽車大王福特因患疝氣、今日忍痛步入其助欵辦成之福特醫院、由醫士施用手術聞進步良佳、福特年已六十有九、從未患重病、曾以美金一千萬元捐助該醫院、</p>
<p>問題、其最後態度若何、今未可遽加武斷、消息靈通之各報、皆承認與美談判下月付欵事實與英國償付能力無關、惟與美國應否收受此欵有關、泰開士報記者切言此問題關係甚重、其事非僅關英國、而全世界皆與有關云、孟却斯德指導報以爲此節縱不爲英國新牒文之材料亦將爲全局之背景、此項付欵、確足阻遏世界繁榮之恢復、正如今削减之賠欵而今繳付也、該報末謂其最近之影響、將爲匯價之起落靡常、物價更向下趨、洛桑恊約成爲廢紙、世界經濟會議淪於危險之中云、</p>
<p>國民社二十六日巴黎電政府頃宣布預計本財政年度終止時、須虧短五十六萬萬佛郎、各報遂以此爲反對繳付十二月十五日到期美債之理由、</p>
<p>國民社二十七日比京電據此間負責方面聲稱、比政府擬照會美國國務院、比政府全不能繳付十二月十五日到期之戰債、比政府係以美政府拒絶展期爲憾、美國雖不收是欵亦儘可無碍云云、惟此又須待英法兩政府對戰債如何决議後、再定發出與否</p>
<p>路透社二十六日華盛頓電美國答波蘭與㨗克申請緩付戰債之文、今日已送出、大意與送交英法比之覆文相同、旣不延長緩付期限、亦未允予以考慮、但僅謂美總統將請國會重行研究戰債主問題耳、</p>
<h3>美國濕派抬頭</h3>
<p>修正禁酒法條文</p>
<p>國會將投票决定</p>
<p>路透社二十六日華盛頓電衆議院可於下月開會之第一日、投票决定取銷第十八條修正文、（即禁酒法）之提案、國國會議員萊尼今日贊成此議、謂許多共和黨與民主黨議員不願贊助准飲啤酒案者、可投票决定棄取、欲廢止禁令、須有多數票、但近數月來、由主張禁酒而變爲主張弛禁者、頗多其人、故渠信衆院必可通過之云、</p>

<h3>晋省的烟禁</h3>
<p>太原通訊、從前的模範省、現在變爲魔窟之山西、近年來毒品充斥、亦可稱爲全國模範、中路各縣丨如榆次太谷祁縣平遙等處丨素稱富庶、白麵（即海洛茵）銷售數量、年達三十餘萬兩、（每兩約値六七十元）、南路及東南路一帶、如新絳運城晋城長治等處丨紅丸（即金丹晋人稱爲紅丸）普遍、亦可謂風行一時、假如有位陌生旅客、由榆次往長治或運城、（前者相距爲六百餘里、後者相距爲九百餘里）沿汽路每個小店、無一處不能購到白麵紅丸、大過其癮、即像在這般禁令森嚴之時、雁北各縣、雖較爲寒苦、舶來品高級料麵、其勢自然稍殺、不過前被奉軍佔據關外（雁門關外）一次、萬　良田、悉改種罌粟、黑貨之產量、恐亦不讓近隣之陜西、獨擅其美、二十年來遍中國、何處不是橫遭天災流行與兵匪蹂躪、吾晋較之他處、原可謂世外桃源、詎知這桃源裏以前雖未受兵災匪禍、而毒物之惡熖、早將大多數人民、麻醉瀕於半死狀態</p>
<p>前年閣氏下野、晋鈔停止兌現以後、農村經濟、由動搖而至於破產、十餘萬客軍給養、全賴着老伯姓擔負、橫征暴歛、層出不窮、顧千方百計　括、仍自不能解决經費困難問題、政府當局、便不得不設法另行開闢財源、和杜絶歴來莫大漏巵、此種新政策、便是「厲行烟禁、」</p>
<p>所謂「厲行烟禁」者蓋由省政府敦請當地名人、組織一「查禁毒品委員會、」凡料販丹販、捕到後即送交軍法會審、無論販賣之多寡、只須證明是販賣、即便判决死刑、自二十年十月禁毒會成立以來、街頭不斷常見一輛之囚車、滿載料販、送至新南門外、執行槍决、迄今年餘送死人數、何下數百、丨内中且有幾個係女性、丨自然、我們對此類禍國殃民害羣之馬、原無所顧惜、但我們不能不可憐彼輩小料販、丨多數僅販賣兩錢三錢一兩半兩、眞正大販客、被捕獲者、實屬寥寥無幾、丨不過因妻子之累、生計所迫、乃不得不行此鋋而走險之途、執法旣如此嚴厲、然而毒品究竟能否肅淸、事實之昭示、則恰與始意相反、因小料販雖逐漸消滅、不啻與大料販造成發財絶妙機會、警若駐晋南某軍、假運輸之利便、軍隊之組織、公然大販而特販、顧何人敢動其毫髮、吸者旣不能自動不吸、販者以有錢可賺焉能不販、</p>
<p>同時省政府「村政處」所專售之「官藥」、即戒烟丸、百分之七十之原料爲鴉片、每年銷售額數、價値約一百五十餘萬元、因難於暢銷、亦不得不加緊改良、以與白麵紅丸和競爭、究竟如何改良、於是新出一種十足生膏、名曰「戒烟藥餅、」戒烟藥餅、係鴉片製成、此原料究如何而來、蓋自雁北戰事後、關外良田、悉種鴉片、奉軍退出、此項收穫、遂由山西省政府收買、年前本有解放烟禁之說、因經民衆反對、遂乃中止、自本年五月起、戒烟藥餅發交郵局寄出者、每月約兩千餘箱、（每箱重十五公斤、即華斤二十四斤）我們不能不穏贊我們政府禁烟之眞心、亦因受戒人數太少乎、在今年八月、更特别委出大批禁烟委員、到各縣駐紥、實行禁烟、專辦推銷官藥、丨每位委員除三十元薪金之外、尙可得百分之十銷售官藥之奬金、於是大批委員老爺、威風十足、上任去也</p>
<p>「厲行烟禁、」不管白貨黑貨、皆在禁售之例、然而官藥是例外、殊不念晋人嗜好、　將愈趨愈深、此種無形損失、金錢消耗、尤其小焉者、體力消失、乃爲國民之眞消耗、願當局注意及之、（十一月二十一日）</p>

<p>事前之規書</p>
<p>新聲社記者、與席　九處長·曁工程師薛兆樞·陸超等、於輪次詳談工振經過、承詳細解答、分誌如次、水利工程設計、本非經長時期通盤籌劃不可、而我國承疲乏之餘、修治尤屬難能、自全國以至省縣、雖水利機關林立、固多龐大之計劃、而實施則寥寥、水災會工振處、以救濟災黎、迫不及待、計劃務求實際、積水一退、立即施工、其設計槪要、分述如下</p>
<p>施工標準去年水災區域、南自洞庭鄱陽、中部江淮漢運、北抵淝澮、沱顥伊洛諸河幹支、兩岸濱决堤綫、達萬里一一修復、非財力所及故就經濟狀况與救濟需要、擬訂施工標準六條、㈠工振範圍、以土工爲限、工程種類、以修復幹堤爲主、濬河洩水爲輔、㈡修堤注重各主要河道之本屆洪水漬决部份㈢以恢復原狀或能抵抗如本屆之洪水爲度、㈣舊堤之竊劣或有礙水道者、得略加修改、如加高培厚移灣取直、㈤殘破舊堤爲土方不超過修　、得酌建新堤、㈥爲宣洩積水起見、得開拓或溝通原有河道、而於長江堤岸即根據去年洪水情形、自鎭江以上修起、</p>
<p>測勘經過水災會成立後、即租定飛機一架、於去年八月商請軍政部曁掦子江整委會、派員乘機、測勘掦子江及洞庭鄱陽兩湖災區、運河水災流域、則由災區工作組主任朱湅瀾將軍曁周象賢等乘機測勘、十月下旬、水勢稍退乃會同掦子江水道整理委員會導淮委員會、湖南江蘇兩省建設廳、湖北江西兩省水利局分别測勘、江漢淮運曁湘沉湖贛各水堤防、對工程估計及施工計劃、始有依據、</p>
<p>堤工標準堤工分繕修及新築一種由水災會技術委員會規定、高度爲高出洪水位一分尺、堤面寛三公尺至四公尺、兩側坡度、外坡一比三、堤高十尺坡長二十尺内坡一比五、較諸舊、堤坡度僅爲一比一者、改　進甚多、并擬訂堤工須知二十條、關於堤岸　土加研、（以石鎚堅新土）騐收監察、（如戴帽穿靴丨即但加堤頂堤　等弊之防止、）等項、均有詳細規定、及堤工圖様六幅、詳示取土留格、以免挖成須堤河流、跨堤築路、須沿河邊第一斜坡、隨河流而下、不得平行逆流、或成直角等法、</p>
<p>濬河計畫江蘇裏下河各地、（鹽城輿化東毫等縣）形如釜底、每遇大水、江淮難容、匯注於此、原有五港、曲折淤察、故於　下河之五港、及豫東之願河沙河、淮泗間之北淝各河、疏濬淤淺、裁直曲折、溝通阻塞、以洩積水、河岸坡度、隨地而異、大率爲一比二·五、亦有一比三與比一者、</p>
<p>施工之經過</p>
<p>工程處　屬於災區工作組、有席鳴九爲處長、内分工務技術兩課、外設工振局十八區、本預定本年六月結束因爲數處工程未完、延至九月、尙有少數未完工程、移歸金國經濟委員會接辦、</p>
<p>分區設局爲便於實施及管理計、按照各河系範圍之大小、　災情之輕重、共分爲十八區、計長江七區、淮河三區、漢水二區、裏下河三區、湘沅伊洛蘇運各一區、除　下河之　十五區、因計畫變更、僅辦三段、分　於第十六七兩區、及湘沅之第十區、委託湖南水災善後後會代辦外其餘十六區、均設立工程局、各置工程師兼局長及副工程師技術員事務等員、區以下、視工程之大小、分爲若干段、每段置副工程師兼段長及技術事務等員、段以下分爲十團、每團置監工副監工、工團分二十排、每排災工二十五人、擇其能者排頭、</p>
<p>麥伐工資水災會向美國貸麥四十五萬噸、以三千萬噸用於工振国就各區測估結束、經技術委員會决定各區分配數目、於浦口蕪湖安　漢口九江設麥糧總站、各他酌設一二三等分站、由運輸組主持運送儲存發放事官、災民工作、按所做土方之多寡、給予工資給付標準、爲㈠平地取土、每市方二角五分至四角、㈡取土在五十公尺以外、每二十公尺每方酌加五分、深處取土、高處落土、每高深一公尺、每方酌加三分、㈢硪工、每方一角、每星期由技術員督察監工騐收土方一次、即塡具節麥憑單、由排頭持向糧站領取</p>

<h3>寗波路積福里盜刦</h3>
<h3>一盜格斃一盜成擒</h3>
<p>三十餘人均被禁閉後廂房内五盜分頭搜刦約二小時之久大批探捕突如其來破門而入一場惡戰廂房墻壁彈痕滿目</p>
<p>昨日下午七時許、寗波路積福里内發生盜劫、經探捕當塲兜捕、以致雙方格鬥、斃盜一名、捕獲一名、茲將調查所得、分述於后、</p>
<p>五盜衣服華麗寗波路積福里、係屬舊名、今已改稱第四百五十七弄、里内多係號家、其中第十號石庫門、係三樓三底、其樓下右廂房爲元餘棉布號及永昶號、左廂房爲巨康號、樓上爲三一新電機織綢廠、及廣福昌號所租用、而各號家經理等均將眷屬住在號内、故總計人口約有三十餘人、當昨日下午五時四十五分左右、該號突來少年五人、均衣華麗衣服、進門後、即由一少年將大門關上、二人直衝上樓、尙有二人踏進右廂房元餘號内、時該號各夥友、均在晚膳、見少年等進内、意爲貿易而來、詎此二人竟袖出手槍、嚇禁各人聲張、並將各夥友驅入右廂房後廂房内、同時在樓上二少年、亦如法泡製、將樓上所有人等威逼下樓、一併關入後廂房、</p>
<p>搜刦約二小時各盜旣將屋内將大小男女關入後廂房後、乃向各號夥友逼索銀櫃鑰匙、後僅由元餘號交出普通銀櫃鑰匙一個、各盜乃派一盜在後廂房門處持槍看守、二盜在樓下搜刦、二盜重行上樓、翻箱倒篋、大肆搜索、自下午五時四十五分起至七時二十分左右、尙未終止、但各號家所有甚微、因此各盜意猶未足、乃重進後廂房、向各人再度威嚇　爭持久之、各夥友一味推諉内、中一盜、即持槍向地上開放一槍示威、然各夥友仍不爲動、内中一盜見示威無效、乃轉向元餘號夥友單獨威脅、逼其交出另一銀櫃鑰匙、該夥友推稱放在經理處、因此羣盜仍未如願、</p>
<p>一盜死一盜擒詎雙方正在爭持不下之時、大門外忽來大批探捕、見大門已被緊閉、乃相率扣門、羣盜聞聲、頓起恐慌、正擬返身時、探捕已破門而入、一半衝進左廂房、見寂無一人、乃折入右廂房、時該房内二盜已退出、各向探捕轟擊、一盜乘紛亂之際即向門外直衝狂奔出弄逃逸、尙有一盜、亦正擬奔避、已爲探捕瞥見、喝令停步、乃將該盜擒獲、同時尙有看守後廂房之一盜、見事機洩露、知擊逃避、乃隱伏門口、向探捕放槍拒捕、各探捕於是亦集向該盜射擊、雙方轟擊不下三十餘槍、該盜即飲彈倒地、時樓上二盜、一聞槍聲、知事不妙、乃相率奔至露台、向擲居屋面上逃逸、及另班探捕上樓、已不及追趕、</p>
<p>各號損失統計各探捕旣斃一盜、擒獲一盜後、即由後廂房内放出衆人、會同分往各室檢查損失、計巨康約一百餘元、元餘三十餘元、永昶因無人、故未遭刦、三一新電機織綢廠被刦去莊票三紙、現洋三十餘元、廣福昌遭刦　最重、計被刦去現洋五十餘元、尙有手飾約値八百餘元、後廂房牆壁上彈痕滿目、衣櫉一拒、前面玻璃已被擊碎、倒地之盜、已氣絶身死屍身横陳右廂房門口地上、血漬斑斑、年約二十七八歲、頭戴呢帽、身穿灰色素毛葛長袍、檢視其身上、共中六槍、並搜出贓物一部、當由捕房將屍身車往斐倫路騐屍所、並將擒獲之盜、帶入捕房拘押、另派探捕追緝未獲盜匪、獲案究辦、該已死之盜、名小三寳、</p>

<h3>棒球場空前足球大戰</h3>
<h3>中華和香港埠際隊</h3>
<p>上半時零此零下半時一比一</p>
<p>丨形勢平均表演精彩丨</p>
<p>丨觀者一萬八千餘人丨</p>
<p>上海中華足球隊、昨日與香港埠際足球隊大戰之結果、各得一球、和局而終、雙方小心作戰、精彩甚多形勢中華稍勝香港、以射門難中鵠的、遂少建樹上半時零比零、最後之一刻鐘、各中一次、觀者人山人海、亦如逸園、當有一萬八千、爲棒球場新紀錄、由吳鐵城市長行開球禮、今明兩晚西人足球會及全國體協會設宴招待、一部份球員、將於星期三南下云、</p>
<h3>市長行開球禮</h3>
<p>中外賓客、駕臨參觀者不少、引人注目、爲吳鐵城市長偕公子幼良、亦翩然蒞場開戰、沈嗣良以機不可失、乃請市長行此盛大比賽之開球禮、經市長之一鐵、虎鬭龍爭、於是開始、</p>

<p>派多（下）黃美順（上）梁榮照鄭少良</p>
<h3>上半時零比零</h3>
<p>江善敬一聲退敵</p>
<p>三時將届、兩隊英雄魚貫入場、小試牛刀之後、銀笛一聲、市長一蹹之後、大戰開始、南方之强、向北進取、坦克事當先開道派多居中掩護巴德萊西陲發難闖過中衛線直向中華球門而來、江善敬大吼一聲、殺出陣去、李義臣遂率師而反攻、</p>
<p>勇李寗獨禦二軍</p>
<p>陳洪光東郊起義小黑炭不敢後人、聲勢虎虎直陷重防、劉茂不示人弱穄斜剌衝來難關渡過鄭少康東陲放馬屠開元欲阻不得豺狼人室危急萬分、李寗氣可呑牛、雲時趕到鄭知事情不妙、乃短傳於黃美順盤未數武、絶爲李寗劫去傳交前方、</p>
<p>梁榮照孤軍救駕</p>
<p>球神作怪東竄西奔、不思人網、馮運佑與霍威、拼賽五十米、居開元舉足截得、經車熟路、交與黑炭連陷重圓勢如疾風暴雨、洪光義臣諸將均已追臨城下、劉茂馬倫分頭迎敵、無如寡不敵多、羅滾幾如釜中之魚束手無策、梁榮照氣愈敗壞趕回防線、得隙開弓、球乃出險香港門前暫告安靜、</p>
<p>周賢言獅子戲球</p>
<p>霍威令下、大舉反攻巴德來狡如脫兎、江善敬雖喜敬而不回敬、球至低縮、馮運佑趕上待搶巴已傳中、李寗與美順同時躍起兩頭不着孫鐵腿埋伏在傍、對門掃去鄭少康霍二人、快如閃電、已趕到門前、周賢言飛身躍起、奪得阿斗、送出難關、如獅子之戲球、博得彩聲雷動、</p>
<p>鄭少康如虎入柙</p>
<p>時南時北、變化不己之、中華前鋒雖勇、以港軍守門之大爲進步屢試無從而港軍之兩翼進攻戰略、亦爲華軍所察破鄭少康在梁樹棠寸步不離監視、如虎人柙、無從發威、亦港軍得志甚難之一、</p>
<p>零比零各無建樹</p>
<p>陳家球帶球闖入敵陣、陳虞添在傍呼應、李義臣助紂爲虐盤過派多梁榮照慣使回馬槍、屠開元坐鎭界牌關、嚴查奸細、小黑炭陳洪光互相呼應送往迎來茂倫一飛衝天、球又回至塲中再接再勵、無如時不吾假、已屆檸檬時間、兩方俱吃鴨蛋</p>

<h3>下半時一比一</h3>
<p>兩方堅持局勢沉悶</p>
<p>兩隊健兒小作休憇精神爲之一振、易地再戰來回衝陷互見危險相持至三十五分鐘、尤未開方便之門、小黑炭頻頻掻首、而二萬一千看客、亦乍驚乍喜、啼笑皆非、局勢沉悶無從開展、</p>
<p>港軍調防應付危局</p>
<p>港軍後方吃緊警訊頻傳、後衛大將馬倫、前局一戰、已受　傷、爲充實後訪之計、乃重　陣線、以派多退守後方、　充馬　、　　美順則回居其拿手之中堅、坐鎭中内、　應四方、霍　居内、而周倫則以充中將、</p>
<p>兩軍激戰陳家球跳起頂珠（李尊席攝）</p>
<p>過門不入奈何奈何</p>
<p>中華人馬在屢次進擊之中、皆廢然而歸、機今雖佳、無奈不中時下局開始又越二十分鐘、陳鎭和在左方直聞、連晨數壘、進抵警戒之區、神兵大連、港門無人、黑炭念傳中央、美妙無窮、大可一蹴而中、不意李中鋒趕來措手不及得之、陳家球亦望之而漏去、及虞添失而復得、敵已有備、遇門不入、奈何奈何、</p>
<p>家球一頂港城陷落</p>
<p>大戰法定時間、僅餘十二分鐘矣、馮運佑在離敵門四十碼、一脚任意之球、去而復來、連射三次、球盤旋移時、李義臣見阻於劉茂、急傳交黑炭、劉茂又趕往周旋黑炭旋身一避、飛起鐵腿傳送中央、中央右異正待機而發、陳家球瞥見來球、在不先不後、不遲不早之間、屈身一頂、砰然中的、雖矣哉此第一球、</p>
<p>馬倫雖傷鐵門竟破</p>
<p>中華勝利之券、已操在手、呢帽齊飛、呼聲四起、蓋港軍欲窺襲進取、亦難乎其難、港軍於其次之五分鐘竭全力以反擊、黃美順中央之一送傷將馬倫帶球直上、竟越中線、而復破後衛線、以達門前在周鐵門一呆之下、馬茂飛起高球、進入門角、此越位之誤會、遂造成秋色平分之和局、其後黑炭雖有一次急烈之射門、無奈中門角之木、而不人網、一轉瞬間、笛聲起處、宜告和局</p>
<h3>勝負得失形勢</h3>
<p>雙方皆愼於守雙方皆霞於前鋒攻射之厲害、故極愼於守、中衞線之衝出推進、難得看見、以防敵鋒之活動、故只見兩方前鋒之時進時退、遂造成此種局勢、而中華隊嚴密監視兩翼、尤爲注重、兩隊難以建樹、此其原因、</p>
<p>表演極爲精彩若是十分小心作戰、雙方皆愼於失誤、故全局精彩疊見、港隊守門後衛俱佳、中華隊江善敬尤爲賣力、周賢門李寗亦恢復原態、前鋒之中、陳虞添上半時有失機之誤、陳淇光未見出色、射門屢失的</p>
<h3>觀者一萬人八千</h3>
<p>草地權充座位香港因日前肇敗上海、是以昨日香港與中華之戰、看客特别擁擠、棒球塲因座位不多、協進會特在場内設座位四百餘、爲兩元特别座、貴族仕女、紛至沓來、座爲之滿、而一元券共售去二千四百餘張、但座位不克容二千人、於是座中旣告滿坑滿谷、水洩不通、而向偶者亦不在少、於是導向場内進攻、圍坐於塲之四周草地上、六角座中、擁擠如人山、毫無插足餘地、門票總計售出一萬四千餘張、另加贈券及搭油朋友、人數當在一萬八千左右、</p>
<p>棒球場新紀錄語云僧多粥少、不夠分配、而昨日之棒球塲、可謂人多場少、平時以爲若大之棒球場、焉能客滿、然以昨日之情形觀之、棒球場卽放大一倍、亦不覺其大、良以已購票者、旣不能人場、而餉閉門斃者、爲數猶在數千以上、從前全盛時代之樂華奪標時、以及萬國足球中英中蘇决賽時、棒球場尙未放大有今日之大、而觀衆尙無昨日之擁擠、場上種種奇形怪態之情形、誠非筆最可能形容、雖不敢謂絶後、前空實未有之盛况、</p>
<p>衝倒協會大門售票房因客滿關閉、</p>
<p>但預　門票者、因到場稍遲、遂論閉門　、不得已羣集協進會大門、一聲嘩喇、大門衝倒、裏面一巡捕小腿傷、受傷甚重、尙有一門卒、頭部亦被擊傷、而外面看客、復如潮湧進、數十巡捕、無法阻擋、有一極時髦之事登小姐、被衝倒地、狂呼不已、幸而未被踏進、然全身時裝、已狼藉不塂矣、</p>

<h3>九三老人馬相伯語録朱夫子製訂的「脚」</h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>相老人談··在幾十年前，游歷到厦門，親見那一帶的婦女們，脚跟離地，一兩寸許，很稀奇，請敎人··當地的士紳很正式的答覆··這是朱夫子製訂的「脚」，不敢擅改自古相傳的遺法！再問問爲什麽朱夫子，好管這事製訂這「脚」？那時便有人回話，拿唸書的口氣說··「防淫奔也！」</p>
<p>以前講過王陽明敎學生格物的實騐法，便呌他在幾天工夫内坐觀正生長中的竹子；現在來談，朱夫子講淫奔非脚不行，所以要製訂一種行動不便的規矩，一個呌人格物，格到頭痛；一個防人淫奔，限制脚了！</p>
<p>其實克念作聖；在此不在彼！請看下文！</p>
<p>「淫惡知何似？流情水決溪··乍汚顏尙赧，稍樅意全迷！獸行業多指，神監逼暗閨；爭如勤自克，貞德是金隄。」</p>
<p>這是墨井吟「貞克淫」的詩。泰西克聖，厄我略曰；「細思死葬之像，最能禁止邪念！」述，個中世紀的故事！</p>
<p>「昔有一修士，見一美女·打扮齊整；後來心中，常懷此像！不久，那美女病死了，葬還未殮，臭水滿流；修士看見那種光景，用手巾沾上臭水收藏。每遇邪念將發生時，嗅此巾，自言曰；「日前見美女，今日到了何等地步了！」</p>
<p>漢書載··李夫人臨歿時，不願見漢武帝··漢武帝才想念伊，倒疑神疑鬼呢！</p>
<h3>安達抗日之四英雄東</h3>
<p>— 南宮</p>
<p>東北三省，爲日軍淪陷之後，人民以不堪日人之蹂躪，紛起抗日，義軍如風起雲湧，各自求民族之生存，日軍遂應付爲難，疲於奔命，致成東北三省，在從來未有之大混亂。各地義軍，疊克各城，抗戰之烈，實所罕見，安達一站尤烈，已數得數失，日前義軍鄧文部，又一度克安達站克復時，乃得力於四抗日英雄。此四英雄，亦爲鄧部義軍，二屬昆仲，姓穆氏，一爲張姓，一名劉雲鵬，在鄧部中任敢死隊員，鄧於攻安達站前，先遺密探，住安達探視日軍實力。時日軍之守安達者，人數達一聯隊之衆，爲侵滬之十一師團一部，鄧部義軍約八百人，有槍五百，聞安達日軍因欲攻拜泉，有調往前線之說，乃乘此機會，下令選敢死隊五十人，皆持炸彈，執大刀手槍爲前鋒，夜襲安達，四英雄即奮然任敢死隊，與衆乘夜疾趨，將抵安達一日軍早於離站三里之某屯，佈置步哨，義軍蛇行而前，爲日軍所見，即喝問口令，張姓一躍而上，舉手槍一發，一日人應聲而仆，其後日軍，聞聲亟以槍掃射，穆抵昆仲，　不顧身，以手溜彈擲擊，轟然一聲，烟霧迷漫，日軍死者甚衆，劉雲鵬在後，振臂大呼，揮大刀而前，斬一日人，穆氏昆仲張姓等繼之，衆乃蠭擁而前，直衡日陣，鄧即督所部擈進，日軍大駭，亟以機槍掃射，張被中一臂一血下如注不顧。</p>
<h3>廢物利用的研究</h3>
<p>— ·粤·民</p>
<p>拿新聞紙來包裹東西。未嘗不是一個廢物利用的方法，不過拿來包裏吃的東西，那就似乎不對了。我見北四川路一帶的食品商店丨尤其是廣東人開設的，像餅餌，糖果，點心，鹵昧，臘味等等吃的東西，差不多十家有九家都用新聞紙來替代包裹，有一天，我買了一包鷄蛋糕回來，打開一看，便覺得火油氣味，屬鼻欲嘔，而且被染了點點的黑色，結果祇好把它送到垃圾坑襄去，因爲新聞紙的字是油墨和火油混合而成的，莫道　不下去，就是勉强吃了，難道不怕有碍衛生嗎？我以爲負有地方衛生責任的人們，理應嚴厲的取締一下機對。</p>
<p>揮刃酣戰，劉臥地滾進，與張至離機槍祗六七步，劉擲彈擊日軍，張即以一臂奪機槍，不幸爲日軍槍中其胸，遂死。穆氏二人，亦撲至張後，立攫機槍，日軍驚退，義軍復大呼逐北，乘勢得安達站，而此抗日奮不顧身之四英雄，除張戰死外，穆氏昆仲因奪機槍爲敵所創，劉則左腿爲日軍剌中，皆爲國受創，此一役，若無四英雄之勇敢絶倫，全線成敗，固未可逆料也。</p>
<h3>藝術化丨文明國民愛好藝術丨</h3>
<p>— 碧</p>
<p>現在甚麽都要藝術化。造房屋要立體式得藝術化。佈置房間，要簡單得藝術化。裁製衣服，要配身得藝術化。繪製廣告，要引人得藝術化。修畫眉毛，要彎曲得藝術化婦女走路，要搖擺得藝術化。說起話來，要雅雋得藝術化。作起文來，要優默得藝術化。據說。一國的文明與野蠻，只要看伊的國民，是否愛好藝術。隨便甚麼，都以藝術爲前提的，便是第一等文明國。</p>
<p>不難，我們試把一切都來藝術化一下。吃飯時，把　連續不繼而很有節奏的在菜碗與嘴距離問運動，最好要顯出狼呑虎另的神色。這裡偉大的行爲，就是藝術化。夫婦失和，不可僅僅怒駡哭泣，應當用木棍切菜刀殺打一陣。要打得頭破血流，東歪西倒，纔是藝術化。馬路不可鋪得平平，因爲太單調，應當鋪得高一塊，低一塊，車子在上面過，要顚簸得像電椅一般，方可算得藝術化。公共私人的時計，要藝術化。不可一律，應當快的快，慢的慢，參差不齊。露天坑厠，沿街設置，并且形式要各式齊備，也可算是藝術化。麽止槍斃，改用絞刑，犯人死後的面部表情，眼張舌突，最是藝術化。髮長不剪，早起不洗臉，不刷齒，再抽上幾口鴉片，把肩兒高聳着，脫二句話，呵欠一下，可脫完全藝術化。駡起人來，先把袖子一捲，二手在腿上用力一拍，接着把手指觸到對方的臉上，涎沬飛過對方的頭頂，這是駡人藝術化。</p>
<p>一切的一切，都藝術化了，或許我們也可掦眉吐氣，做一等文明國的大國民了。</p>
<h3>死之岔道㈡㈩㈦</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>更生自然答應了，隨着伊上電梯，到４３６號房間裏，這時已無暇細看房問裏陳設，急於要聽伊陳訴經歷了。並且也毋庸涉及兒女之情，料想有狠重要的事情，立刻在追趕而來了。</p>
<p>愛　搓着手，仰起了𩓐子說··『天哪！怎的我還會見你？』更生說··『日間在電梯裏，已瞧見你，不過不敢問你，因爲那時我實在給你時髦的模様迷蒙了，不能使我堅信是你了。』愛　拍手說··『對啦！我也這般想，我見你左耳下兩個小眼，這是你的表記，你的特微，江北人和别地方人，因着爺娘喜歡，給他穿一個眼，戴一個　，這是狠多狠多的；但是我知道你在當時，，個眼穿不透，再穿第二個，長成了兩個眼並存着，這是你特有的。</p>
<p>『嗄！那麽，你向我細看，不是看我的號布啊。』</p>
<p>『問話少說，我有要緊的事和你商量。』</p>
<p>『什麽事？』</p>
<p>『我在這幾天，正給一個人纏的要命，這人是我的仇敵，可笑他竟不認得我，向求愛，我想平凡的拒絶他，太便宜他了，有沒有好法子對付他？』</p>
<p>『是誰？』</p>
<p>『就是用』百五十塊錢買你的終身之伴的韓慕良！』</p>
<p>『嗯······』</p>
<p>『本來我也不認得他因爲他做過ＸＸ部的小官，嘴上添着一撮小　，又是太斵喪，比前瘦得多了，後來他自己向我說出眞姓各來，並且撒一個大謊說··「還沒有娶妻咧。」』</p>
<p>更生樸嚇一笑。愛麗也笑了一笑說··『他還要向我誇　他愛情的眞摯和專一，把一個並無遇失的姨太太攆走了，還算眞摰專一，男人眞是個撒謊專家！』</p>
<p>『他再也想不到，眼前心愛的，就是以前厭棄的啊。』更生把肘彎放在膝上，手撑着下顧，微仰着眼光，直射着愛麗。愛麗抽一支香烟給他，更生搖搖頭，愛麗自己吸了，裝在一隻狠細狠長的烟咀裡，連香烟足有六英寸長，撮尖了嘴，把烟絲壓迫成細　，慢慢的藝術的裊出來。更生好像在電影場裏，看好蘭塢女明星，在表演着。忍不住說··「『莫怪這賊昏了，看不出，就是我，倘然不注意你左額上的癈，决不會起一點疑心的，你自己向鏡子裏去瞧瞧，那裡還是以前愛姑的模様呢！』愛麗說··『的確！我已換了一個人，老實話，我已成了一個社會上最下賤，最險毒的女人了。我正在想，做一件更險毒的事，去敎訓那些專以紙幣買肉來玩的所謂少爺。』說完，恨恨地，把大半枝香烟，猛擲向窗外，也不管窗外是什麽，那時伊已憤激極了，不要說窗外，無論什麽，伊都不管。更生急切也想不出適當的需要的話，夫安慰伊，解勸伊，只好獐笑，點頭，太息，參互着，調節着。</p>
<p>後來愛麗問更生，怎様的做了軍人？更生說··『做打自家的軍人，去說他什麽，這回打外國人了，又是什麽都不凄手，實在沒有飯喫，不肯做强盜，　走這一條路的。』愛麗翘着拇指說··『這回你們ＸＸ路軍二十多天的苦戰，可比得『戚繼光打東洋了。』</p>
<p>更生禁不住笑起來了，說··『你看過這齣戯麽？』愛麗點頭，暫時靜默了三分鐘，突然的立起來，坐到更生的身邊來，側遇頭去問··『你要錢化麽？我的心是肯給你的，我的身體，已不能給你了。』</p>
<p>『當然。』</p>
<p>『你别誤會了！你以爲我是跳舞明星，所以不能給你了，你把這幾年的經過想想，你是常在我們翠微村上的貞節牌坊下面走過的，那麽，你綫明白是，「不能，不是「不肯。」』</p>
<p>『那麽，你預備怎様？』</p>
<p>愛麗的嘴凑近了更生的耳，說了好久好久的話，這重逢的一幕就閉了。</p>

<h3>鄭孝胥老而不死</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>「鄭孝胥老而不死」這話不是我駡的，是溥儀夫人榮氏駡的，老而不死，未必多是賊，而鄭孝胥的確是賊，是國之叛賊，把老而不死駡他，眞是對的，</p>
<p>鄭孝胥「吹檴老爺煨砂鍋」，想做復辟的迷夢，慫恿溥儀，爲日人傀儡，甘冒天下之大不韙，結果溥儀說「我那裏當得起傀儡，我是一個囚徒罷了，」因溥儀自傀儡登塲後，行動全失自由，一切由日人監視，即說話之間，亦須十分謹愼，不敢觸犯日人一句，否則就要被監視者請去「吃大菜」這原是鄭孝胥輩，一般狐羣狗黨造成的孽障，</p>
<p>現在鄭孝胥又異想天開，欲替溥儀「拉皮條子」，慫恿溥儀納妾，並且納日女的妾，眞是人面無恥，無不遄死，溥儀自文繡下堂去後，自不免稍感寂寞，鄭乃趁此機會，勸溥儀納日女爲妾，一方面欲獻媚於溥儀，一方面對於日人亦表示好感，眞是一舉兩得的計畫，那知自溥儀爲囚徒後，一言一動，均有日人日貨暢銷以本求利奸商士英</p>
<p>監視，但是牀第之間，容有地方未便監視之處，現在名義上雖爲溥儀納妾，而事實上不啻於房内放一女監察員，那溥儀眞是毫無生路矣，</p>
<p>猶憶溥儀幼時，擬僱一外國保姆，日當局聞訊，即開御前會議，保薦某公爵之女，並由著名三賣國賊之一，爲之介紹，並附帶條件三項，一，全部宮内，游行自由，二，時期須二十年，三，對於本國書信，完全有秘密權，因此我國内情，都爲日人洞悉，</p>
<p>假定納妾而果成事實，則溥儀一生始終與日女有緣，始則不離於保姆之手，繼則不離於日妾之手，眞是溥儀之幸運，而國家之禍根矣，</p>

<h3>歲暮感懷</h3>
<p>— 陳葆仁</p>
<p>霜雪天涯夢未安，　裘無奈不禁寒，風塵苦我詩難藥，愁病懷人　又闌，亂重帕驚寒鳫至，情深書透世途難，故鄕燈火團團候，休聽琵琶着意彈，</p>

<p>天涯刻骨誰知己，恨望斜陽一倚樓，懷我黃花多少淚，新砧聲並朔風秋，</p>

<h3>用具積垢滌除法</h3>
<p>— 左企</p>
<p>作者前草一文，專述衣服上汚濆之滌除法，茲再將用具上積垢之滌除法彙述於此，以補前文之不及。</p>
<p>（一）漆器上之積垢漆器係指髹油漆之木器而言。漆器上積有汚漬時可用絨布或軟布　取阿摩尼亞水及酒精各半之混合液，輕輕揩拭，即光潔如新。又法，用檸檬一片揩擦漆面，再以肥皂及冷水洗之。</p>
<p>（二）假漆器上之積垢假漆一名洋漆，文名凡立司，遇熱則變色，故假漆上染有汚漬時，不可用熱水洗拭，須用冷茶或牛乳揩拭。又法，於冷水中加醋少許，用軟布蘸而拭之，亦有效。</p>
<p>（三）搪磯器上之積垢可用絲瓜絡或髮團塗肥皂揩擦，再以清水冲洗。又法，以醋水混合之稀薄液洗之。又法用蘸松節油刷之，亦能盡凈。</p>
<p>（四）陶磯器上之積垢用肥皂水洗之，或以鹽擦之，或以細灰和醋拭之，或用布蘸松節油刷之皆可。洗碗碟時，於水中加入檸檬皮一片，可除一切魚腥葱臭等餘味，且能使磁面光潔。</p>
<p>（五）玻璃器上之積垢先用肥皂水洗之，再以清水滌凈。倘於水中加醋少許，可使玻璃光潔明凈。玻璃杯碟可用食鹽或灰汁搽擦。洗玻瓶之法··盛水半瓶，投入茶滓或芥末震盪之，再以清水滌凈之。揩拭玻璃窗之法··將阿摩尼亞水加入溫水中，用布蘸而拭之。又法，以鉛粉和水塗擦玻窗上，俟其乾時用乾布拭之。洗拭熏黑燈罩法··以醋及食鹽各少許加入溫水内，將燈罩浸入，俟烟炱浮離，用皮紙或其他薄紙拭凈之。</p>
<p>（六）鋼精器上之積垢鋼精器上之汚垢及油膩，可用熱肥皂水，鹹水或灰汁洗擦之，再濯以清水。</p>
<p>（七）金器上之積垢金器久用，往往發黯，可用布蘸酒精拭之，再用鞣皮擦之，或用火響研極細擦之，皆能使其煥然一新。</p>
<p>（八）銀器上之積垢銀器久用，亦易受汚而發曇，刷新之法，除用擦銀粉外，可用香粉擦之，或以布蘸稀薄硝酸拭之。又法將炎酸鈣溶於水中，攪之使其溶化，然後以軟布蘸此液擦之。</p>
<p>（九）銅器上之積垢銅器使用日久即生綠銹，滌除之法，先將銅器置於熱肥皂水中洗之，然後再以擦銅藥擦之。又法，將銅器置醋中，浸一日取出，再以錫箔灰擦之。黃銅器物可用布塗石蠟擦拭，再以潔凈軟布擦亮之。白銅器物可用香灰或瓦屑粉擦亮之。紫銅變黑時，可用變化第二鐵塗布上擦之，再以擰檬汁洗之，</p>
<p>（十）鐵器上之積垢鐵器生銹，用砂皮或細砂擦之，或用磚塊帶水磨擦，拭乾後以菜油抺之。釜鍋上之油膩，可</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>用熱䶨水成布灰汁洗豫以除之。交　葷腥之物後’盛水於鍋’加醋二匙’煑之使沸’可　葷腥餘味。</p>
<p>（十一）錫器上之積老垢，錫器積垢，即星脢　，滌除之法，先將錫器置放䶨水或肥皂水中浸洗’取出拭乾’再以香灰擦之。</p>
<p>（十二）橡皮熱水袋及其他橡皮製品’積有汚垢時’可用蘇打（即洋䶨）水或阿摩尼亞水洗之。</p>
<p>（十三）琥珀珠子等飾物上之積垢，</p>
<p>宜用牛乳洗之。</p>
<p>（十四）熨斗上之汚垢’可用下法除之··將蜂蠟一塊夾置於兩方絨布間’乘熨斗熱時在絨布上移擦’汚迹立除。</p>
<p>（十五）圖章上之印泥積垢’可用舊牙刷蕪硼砂或戤司林（汽油）洗刷之。</p>
<p>（十六）洗海綿法··先將海綿放入冷水中浸片刻’取出擠乾’再放入加於檸檬汁之水中浸洗’最後用清水漂凈之。</p>
<p>（十七）美皮手套染汚時’以絨布浸牛乳中’取去扭乾’拭之即除。又市上有專洗皮手套用之肥皂’亦可購用。</p>
<h3>烈士們現在怎様？</h3>
<p>— 娜夫</p>
<p>烈士的手可愛的烈士的手！</p>
<p>如果你無意地看到這隻烈士的手’必定使你毛管悚然’熱血緊張地沸騰或者更使你興奮。因爲一隻放在玻璃瓶内的人手；表現出灰白色的皮膚’皮膚外層變成了魚鏻般的縐紋’在掌心左邊一個三寸來大的彈痕的大孔’流出了一把把灰黑色的肉絲’和一團赤黑色的骨椎’顯然是受過刀痕的削斷的様子’聞說這些彈痕都是被逹姆彈所毀炸的傷痕。同時高指着天際的五指’表示出一種勇敢的神氣’假如你突然看去’眞會使你又悲痛又恐懼又興奮！</p>
<p>據說’這隻手就是去年「一二八」戰死的烈士所遺留的紀念品。除了這隻手之外還有一隻同様可愛的脚’其餘’有幾顆巨大的彈子’其中有一顆在彈内可藏二百磅重量的炸藥’計重有六百磅’其餘那幾顆比較略小一點。</p>
<p>上面所述的東西’都是去年「一二八」上海之役的戰利品’現在陳列在本市民衆敎育館内的’當我在這裏參觀這些東西時’我感到這些東西陳列在這裏眞是恰當’一來可以紀念我們過去抵抗的成績’與表現我們復活的精神’其次’可使我們的民衆時常領略到暴日給與我們的禮物’和過去所受的痛苦的敎訓。</p>
<p>然而「一二八」的事件隔今將要到一週年了’犧牲了去的烈士們’現在黃泉之下’究竟歡欣還是悲痛？我們現在偷生着的人們知到不知到呢？</p>
<h3>郵呈母親</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>母親··三月不接家信’兒只想闔家平安！豈知忽得大哥手書’說吾母病益沉疴’不出房門已三月’不離床第已月餘’終日號痛’永夕不寢’醫者束手’無以爲方’是豈大哥之故作危詞耶！誠使兒雒誦流淚’釋手悽然’不知悲何自來’幾時休！</p>
<p>吾母病始去春’迄今將近兩載’醫者云··病源於勞頓過度’成於體質虧虚。是蓋吾母六十年來’生育兒女’管敎孫輩’料理家務’未嘗一日稍閒’益以兒等不肖’以致家道中爼’父親見而憂忿’每向吾母洩氣’精神之鬱結’殆尤甚焉！然吾母平日非獨對兒等不加讉責，抑尤視如掌珠’求無不應’應無不行，昔大哥誘於環境，沉淪賭塲，一輸數十金，無以歸家，事爲吾母聞，輒凑欵請人往領　三哥喜酒，父親不予，吾母必暗中給飲，兒初學時，每次回家，父親僅給零錢少許，兒畏其嚴，亦不敢索，暗求於吾母，輒如數付予，其若兒媳之不陸，姑嫂之失和，吾母　中媳言勸解，事乃得患，父　咸於年入不量，己食堪虞，故對行乞走卒，每多叱駡，而吾母總是借貸　濟，受者感而頌掦，事聞於父，父又責備吾母，使不能安；然吾母一仍其故，曾未稍渝，是皆吾母之丹心仁慈，有以使然也！兒今念及，不覺感嘅系之，淚潜潜下！</p>
<p>吾母生於農家，長於鄕曲，䈂年歸父，而又終日繁忙，未嘗稍習詩書·然於吾國一　之禮敎丨事翁姑以孝，事父以敬，敎兒以慈，待人以和，未聞有失，惟其如此，對兒等前程，亦少遠大目光之敎示·然兒自稍曉人事以來，感切吾母勤儉仁慈之薰陶，知所以修身治學，知所以人類原重互助，匪獨居家爲然耳，今而後，自當秉體斯意，益勵操持，以期母負吾母！</p>
<p>自兒入世，適値政體鼎革，十載以來所受敎育之洗禮，兼感兄嫂之不睦，因而曾請兒的婚姻，須自擇配，吾母聞而肯首，從無異言，是固非吾母之能洞觀潮流，意在不失兒心也，然由此亦可見吾母之不若他人頑固，致兒雖生長於舊家庭，而能擺脫舊婚姻之苦痛，逍遙自在獲有今日者·</p>
<p>十七年春正，祖歿出殯，吾母昕夕無睱，爲之料理，時猶康健如　，惟間飲食不進耳，二月一日，兒即子然遠别，來滬就學，秋間大病，吾母在家爲之算命信神，延醫求方，囑大哥來函，詳示種切，是雖迷信罔效，要亦吾母愛子心切之顯示也！去年夏六月，兒請假返里，抵家後，吾母臥於床上，問之家人，不告，啓帪而視之，始駭然吾母病癯之慘，骨瘦如柴，是時吾母猶不輕吐實情，是蓋恐兒因之而輟學也！比及兒重來滬前夕，方略示病之隱痛，囑早賦歸，·時兒以病旣漸痊，乃遂寬懐重別，今夏四月，兒返長沙就道回家，而又肇於人事，留僅八日而别，醫者雖云病難霍然，然亦無危，豈知而竟轉劇，危在旦夕矣！</p>
<p>大哥信中有云··「能早歸回，尙有面緣一倘瑤池促召即有電告·」母親，兒何嘗不想及早賦旋，投向你的懷抱，無奈飄泊之身，清風兩袖，一筆偌大的川　　呌向何處告貸？兒祇有仰天祈禱，看待年底，倘果瑤池促召，母親呀，兒子只有淚洒黃浦，看它能否逆流到湘江之濱，雨化到你的塋前？！</p>
<p>母親，大上海每日都有人死，往昔兒視出喪之事，漫不經心，近日以來，緣於觸景生情，一見就要黯然傷神，母親呀，兒眞害怕這「死」的恐怖啊！</p>
<p>這年頭，生原無意義，况人之必亡，自古已然·惟以吾母終生勤勞，未稍得閒，而又未受物質上之絲毫享樂，如</p>
<p>此一世，那得不使你的兒子悲傷落淚，慟哭失聲！</p>
<p>兒旣不曾如古之老萊子，侍側定省，戲彩承歡；復不能如今之冰心女士，抒寫文辭，以留紀念，碌碌飄流，誠無以安吾母之心於萬一！思念及此，良滋内疚！今惟有衷心祈禱··吾母年壽稍駐，予兒子以最後面緣，母親呀，兒心碎了！兒只有衷心祈禱！</p>

<p>㈠中國人的時間</p>
<p>中國人的時間眞不算，我曾數過從四馬路浙江路口順興衣莊店起，到山東路口中法藥房爲止，七十九家的時辰鐘，是沒有一只相同的。相差從數分起到一點上都有。外國人說中國人如一盤散沙，不料中國人的鐘，也犯此手病。</p>

<p>弄堂中小便，是不成文憲法。「禁止小便」的告白，却等於「准予小便」的招貼，十多數人是在這告白的暗示之下，得到方便。</p>

<p>有一次，我走過法大馬路，一個黃包車夫不等巡捕警棍的指揮，性急的衝過了馬路，巡捕赫然大怒，過來把照會揭下，憑黃包車夫跪求也無效。結果，「行裏去」，像馴羊一様地牽了走。我看了悚然，覺得法莫大於警章，一點也不寬貸。你看，國聯盟約，處置不了日本，陸海空軍刑法，解决不了内戰而違警律却得條條遵守。「巡捕眞是値得贊嘆的」，我想。</p>

<p>上海是二千年來的歷史博物館，是二十世紀的怪舞台。你看路上，小車與摩托卡齊飛，虹廟與舞塲並列。當你走在路上時就覺得猶如走進了歷史博物館，或是看了一張歷史影片。猗歟盛哉！此其所以爲東方之巴黎歟？</p>

<h3>南京大戲院的「龍虎鬥」</h3>
<p>— 凛</p>
<p>雷電華公司的野獸鉅片龍虎鬭，大約本禮拜四·可以在南京大戲院開映了。這張狩　片子，沒有「人獸奇觀」那麽長，情節亦沒有那麽複雜；但他却能獨立門户·自成一家·自有他的特長·爲「人獸奇觀」所不可及之處。其第一特别優長之點·爲虎·豹·蛇·觸·牛·象·等等的互相殘殺爭鬥；此等處·觀之令人驚心動魄，必定有許多膽小的人·不敢看，或看了驚悸，回去晚上睡不著·作惡夢·等等的Ａftereffecto你若不信我的話·我且講一段故事給你聽聽·你就相信了；</p>
<p>「雷電華公司一龍虎鬭」出品之後，狐狸公司亦要出一張狩獵片子，片名聞已定爲「食人國」ＭanEater；並且聘請了·「龍虎鬭片子的導演CliveElliott作這張新片子的指導員；此外又聘了一位鼎鼎大名的主角··他的名字，當然沒有宣佈出來；我亦當然無從而知。這位主角，聽了請他作鉅片之主角，並且　要到斐洲去游歷（片子是要在蘇門搭拉去拍的）他起了「見獵心喜」的觀念，高高興興的，毫不思慮的答以訂了一年的合同。他簽好了合同，就快快活活的去到一個影戲院看影戲，而却巧他看的係這張我們所要看的「龍處鬭」·他從頭到底看得他怵目驚心；他想··到斐洲去拍獸片，不是人的生活；他越想越怕，大慨他一夜沒有睡著覺；等到明天一亮，他就爬了起來，走到狐狸公司的寫字間，靜候經理先生的來到。爲什麽？因爲他說「斐洲，我是不去了；我要取銷昨天簽的那張合同」！</p>
<p>這張片子係佛蘭克勃克ＦranKBucK在馬來羣島中所攝的精心傑作。裏面沒有一尺不是在馬來攝成的，其中以蛇虎相鬭一節，最爲緊張。以偌大的斑斑猛虎·乃爲數丈餘長的「海公子」所困·週自糾纏而不逢脫，然蟒爲亦爲精疲力竭·俱爲人所捕獲。再者捉捕猛獸毒蛇等的技術，亦巧妙到不可思議。如果你一定要看武松在景陽岡上打虎的話，那我就不說了，不然的話，這張「龍虎鬭」是直得看一看的。再則我在沒有看這張片子之前，心裏覺得這個名字譯得太俗了，但是看過之後，我覺得這個名字·確當無比，因爲那條巨蟒一隻斑虎的驚天動地的惡戰，的確可以當得起龍虎鬭三個字。但英文字係ＢringEmBackAlive，倘使譯爲「生擒活捉」，豈不恰切字義而不犯俗，質諸盧君蒔白，以爲如何？</p>

<h3>「消防新術」譚</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>一看見消防新術，（Fireman,SaveMyChild）或是卡而登的廣告，就可以知道牠是一張詼諧的趣劇。</p>
<p>本事是··一位棒球國手，醉心於救火事業，常常因遠處失愼，就置比賽於不顧，不過爲了想和一位女郎結婚，所以不得不棄消防隊的職位，而去作一個球員；同時他又研究出了救火神速的化學品，於是名利雙收。比賽亦因而得勝’得意歸來’就和她結了婚。</p>
<p>情節和十年前陸克「足球大王」差不多’内容也比得上賈克歐凱的「傻球王」。更和「傻球王」一様的’就是棒球比賽。特别是那飾「救火迷」的佐義勃郎（JoeE.Briwn）作風舉動’甚至容貌’都和賈克歐凱彷彿。那很平淡的吃香蕉’</p>
<p>擲球法等等都會引人發笑。他的確是一位滑稽的天才。埃佛玲奈波（EvalynKnapp）得不錯’片中穿揷的一小段三角戀愛給她了發展的地方’這當然也是導演的能力。其餘的人都還算是趣劇中不錯的配角。</p>
<p>如果你走過卡爾登門口’聽見不斷的笑聲’這都是勃郎的功勞。</p>

<h3>「覺人覺世」！</h3>
<p>— 伯章</p>
<p>中國現在的影片’除了戀愛片’武俠片···等外覺人覺世的影片是很少的！除了一部「人道」之外’其餘簡直差不多沒有！</p>
<p>現在我們希望中國各大影片公司都要集中他們精神去多拍幾部「覺人覺世」的片子！因爲現在要想改良中國的社會和人民的心理’我以爲利用影片是最好的方法了。現在’標語是已經麻木了！講演是沒有用了！惟有影片年年可以演映’再加上影戲的影響於人民的心理是很大的！而且是在不知不覺中。</p>
<p>不過’「覺人覺世」的影片’我也知道是很難拽集材料的小但是如遇其中夾一蒙戀愛性　便迎合了看衆心理　這是　而易舉的！</p>

<h3>泰露拉彭海幼年小史（上）</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>泰露拉彭海是美國亞拉巴瑪省人’生於一千九百零二年正月二十一日’她的年輕而美麗的母親’差不多爲了生產她而送掉自己的生命。她在生產之後’經過三星期的爭扎’終於不要。臨終之時’她問起兩個孩子丨泰露拉和她的姊姊幽近妮丨說··「我要向她們講幾句話」。所以家人就把產生纔二十一天的泰露拉’放在她的身邊’幽近妮也立在　牀’圓轉的眼睛望着母親’似乎覺着　恐様子。這時’她講了一番悲傷的話’在這房間裏’因爲沒有别人站着’怎様的話’就不得而知了。</p>
<p>幾分鐘後’她的丈夫和家屬’都圍站着望她’她說「當心幽近妮’但是不要擔憂泰露拉’她自己一定會當心自己的」。這個奇怪的靈塊的預言丨泰露拉能夠當心自己’因爲她二十一天的年齡’己足夠知道她的所欲丨瞬息過去了。一年又一年’泰露拉從幼女到少女到少婦。的確’她顧了自己’還常常當心她的姊姊幽近妮。</p>
<p>泰露拉是一個脾氣暴躁’而富於意像力的女孩。她對於四周環繞着的東西’都有一種好奇心。她在每一個時問裏’都能得到偉大的成功。</p>
<p>有一次’她拿了她祖父的方頭雪茹烟吸着’被他瞧見了’就重重責打了一頓。她覺得很憤恨。她想這次的責備’太過分了’因爲她吸烟的時候’正爬在一顆栗樹上’她吸這麻醉品之後’她覺得頭昏了’她從栗樹上跌下來’恰巧她的祖父母坐在那樹底下的椅上’被他們瞧見了’就給她一個痛苦的拷打。好說吸了那「混賬東西」’已是夠受的了’還要受責打麽？</p>
<p>她的脾氣很暴躁’當她要一件東西而不得時’隨便什麽’都要拉着亂抛；還要躺在地板上’用兩隻手掩住她的耳朶’面着地’朝前朝後的亂滾’吵個不休。她那看護的黑女’往往被她嚇得眼睛向上瞧’口裏高聲的嚷着說··「泰露拉小姐又發氣了’你們快來帮我攙她起來啊」。不一刻’家人全都奔來攙她’拍去她身上的齷齪’呌她靜些’直等到寵愛她的伯母或嚴厲的祖父母給她糖果’她纔不吵了。這種頑皮而勇敢的事情’她常常會發作的。可是她覺悟也很快’不久就變了少年老成。在這個時代裏’她不歡喜和小孩們玩’她只喜歡和成年人在一起。當她到屋子裡的時候’她很恭敬的敲着門；她伯母聽了’問一聲「誰？」她就用很輕柔的聲音回答說··「我是泰露拉」’然後開了門進去。</p>
<p>泰露拉在兒童的時候’害了好幾年的喉核和喉管炎等症。這就是好所說她發看低的綠故。（未完）</p>
<p>影界珍聞</p>
<h3>她的特殊的職業’喊</h3>
<p>— 紫因</p>
<p>收攝有聲電影的時候’遇到驚恐的表現’就要收進驚呼的聲音。但高聲帶不是每個明星都有。很有許多大明星不能高呼的哩。康司登裴納脫是不會高呼的。露司却德登’和開法蘭昔司都也不會高呼。結果’有一位名喚愛立司’桃兒（AlieeDoll）的女人’有了一個特殊的職業了。</p>
<p>譬如’當裴納脫在一幕謀殺案中’她差不多有很多驚呼的動作’其實呢’她是一個大氣都沒出。</p>
<p>裴納脫說··「我驚呼起來的聲音只是丨依丨克·假使我眞地盡力高呼起來’那我要個把鏡頭講不來話了。」</p>
<p>她的導演連忙道··「不要高呼吧’這損失太大了。愛立司’桃兒能夠一直替你高呼的」</p>
<p>確實’損壞一個明星的珠喉’在拍影的當兒’於公司的損失實在太大了。很多人過份呼喊是會使喉啞的。但也有像愛立司’桃兒那般接連的呼喊’而不會於聲帶受傷的人。所以她就給好萊塢許多聞名的明星代作替身了。</p>
<p>她還能夠變動她的呼聲’去適合所代替者的性格和喉音。像她這様眞不能不算做一種特殊的職業了。</p>
<h3>編劇的笑話</h3>
<p>— 斌</p>
<p>下面的這一段故事’是發生在美國的好萊塢的··美國的電影塲裏’有一個辦電影事業的人’有一天’他去要求一個編劇家’替他編一本劇本’而這劇本的内容’要包含下例四種的··</p>
<p>（一）含有宗敎意義的’</p>
<p>（二）含有貴族化的’</p>
<p>（三）含有性慾思想的；</p>
<p>（四）含有驚駭口吻的。</p>
<p>不多幾天’編劇家的劇本編好了’但是電影家一看’却是弄得莫名其土地堂；原來這劇本非常簡短’他的内容說··「『上帝呵！」這個公爵夫人呌道··「你快把你的手在我的腿上拿開呀·」』</p>
<p>”MyGodi”ctiedtheDuchess“takeawayyourhandoffmylegs,”</p>
<p>電影家便去請敎編劇家；編劇家笑着答道··『這是很客易解釋的呀！你瞧這「上帝」不是含有宗敎意義的嗎？公爵夫人’是不是貴族化？夫人呌男的把手在好她的腿問拿開’這不是性慾是什麽？公爵夫人的語氣’不是帶着突如其來的驚駭口吻嗎？反以你所要的四條内容’我都給你描寫到了！』</p>
<p>於是電影家不由的哈哈大笑起來了。</p>
<p>電影專著</p>
<h3>像馬戲場裏的馬</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>演電影戲與舞臺戲不同。舞臺戲從開幕到閉幕’各演員的表情是循序漸進的表演出來的。電影戲却不然。拍戲的時候’並不是按着次序拍的。頂有耐性的導演至多也不過告訴你說’「現在要拍第幾號的鏡頭了’這個鏡頭是一個特寫’你是爲受了某人某人的氣’現在你就要咬牙切齒的生氣。這種命令在演慣了舞臺的人聽了’好像是非常無意識的。但是·你要明白’拍影戲的演員’並不是在那兒演戲’他是在那裏照像。一部電影戲’無非是許多有連貫性的照片顛來倒去的拍進膠片去’然後又順着次序重新剪接起來罷了。</p>
<p>所以做電影演員的人’必須對於表情有超過舞臺演員的能力纔行。借馬來做比喻。舞臺演員的工作彷彿像賽馬的馬’或是上戰線的馬。雖然他們的工作並不是出於自己的本意’但是多少總還能得到一點兒近於自然的興味。而電影演員的工作却像馬戲塲裏的馬。他是很難得到發展自由意志的機會的。</p>
<p>因爲這個緣故’你在練習的時候’必須把各種面部表情練到『呼之即來’揮之即去』的地步’方纔能夠在聽了導演的命令之後不至於心慌意亂’無法對付。</p>
<p>在練習第二式’留住憤怒狀態的時候’呼吸固然可以帮助你達到憤怒的緊張情緒’但是你的想像力却要擔任一大半的工作。你要能夠設想鏡中的你就是你的殺父之仇’　者’時者’點說’就是得了你的愛人的情敵’你的怨容自然會逼眞起來了。</p>

<p>Demanding Actual Equality of Capital Ships Among Britain, America, and Japan, Overturning the 5:5:3 Ratio Set by the Washington Conference, and Rejecting Hoover's Proposal for a Universal One-Third Reduction</p>
<p>Proposing the Abolition of Aircraft Carriers on One Hand, While Hastening the Conversion and Construction of Aircraft Carriers on the Other</p>
<h3>The Disarmament Conference Adds Another Major Dispute</h3>
<p>Geneva - Japan has drafted a new naval disarmament plan, which will likely be submitted to the Technical Committee of the Disarmament Conference within the next week. Its contents include: 1) Demanding actual equality of capital ships among Britain, America, and Japan, overturning the 5:5:3 ratio set by the Washington Conference; 2) Rejecting U.S. President Hoover's proposal for a universal one-third reduction. Proposing that Britain and America each sacrifice five capital ships, while Japan only sacrifices one. However, in exchange for considerable concessions, Japan can also sacrifice two capital ships; 3) Furthermore, to conclude a disarmament treaty based on each country's geographical needs, making it unnecessary to convene the disarmament conference scheduled by the Washington Conference for 1935.</p>
<p>Japan's reason for rejecting President Hoover's plan is that a universal one-third reduction in the army and navy will make strong countries stronger and weak countries weaker. Hoover's plan is purely a quantitative disarmament. During the Geneva Conference in July, a resolution was declared stating that aggressive weapons should be reduced to the minimum limit to increase the effectiveness of defensive weapons. Hoover's plan completely ignores this point. Therefore, Japan proposes concluding a new disarmament treaty based on this fundamental principle, making it unnecessary to convene the 1935 conference scheduled by the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>As for the allocation of defensive weapons, Japan's plan will elaborate in detail, generally advocating that each country, after thoroughly considering its geographical needs and other factors, maintain defensive capabilities based on actual needs.</p>
<p>Submarines are one of the defensive weapons, so there is an absolute need for them. However, their maximum tonnage (tonnage per vessel) can be reduced by agreement. The London Treaty allowed a maximum tonnage of 2,000 tons per submarine. Although Japan does not advocate further reduction, it also believes that a reduction is not impossible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is planned to abolish aircraft carriers and prohibit all cruisers from carrying aircraft. According to the Washington Conference, the maximum size of aircraft carriers was limited to 17,000 tons. Now, Japan proposes to abolish them all. The Washington Conference also stipulated that the maximum size of capital ships should not exceed 35,000 tons. Japan now proposes that the maximum size should not exceed 25,000 tons. At the same time, the size of the main guns on the ships should also be reduced from the 16 inches allowed by the Washington Conference to 14 inches.</p>
<p>As for the number of capital ships, it can also be reduced in proportion under a military agreement based on national defense needs. It is suggested that Britain and America reduce their capital ships from fifteen to ten, and Japan reduce its capital ships from nine to eight. However, if Japan obtains certain concessions, its capital ships can also be limited to seven.</p>
<p>The Washington Naval Disarmament Treaty was signed on February 6, 1922. The most severely restricted were capital ships. At that time, it was agreed that the number of capital ships would be the basis for each country's naval strength, and the naval ratio of Britain, America, and Japan was set at 5:5:3. Although Japan tried its best to oppose it, it finally yielded to Britain and America. The treaty also stipulated that it would expire on December 31, 1936. Whether to continue after that should be notified two years before the expiration date, which is equivalent to automatically stipulating that another meeting must be held in the spring of 1935. Since the establishment of this treaty, the Four-Power Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty have been signed. Japan's new plan seems to be requesting a reconsideration of Japan's position in the Far East, demanding an equal ratio with Britain and America. It is said that if the Japanese request is allowed, it would be tantamount to publicly acknowledging its hegemony in Asia. (National News Agency dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese naval authorities, in view of the ability of the aircraft carrier Notoro in the Shanghai battle, feel the need to increase this type of special vessel in future naval battles. Therefore, it has been decided to convert the special vessel Kamoi (17,000 tons) into an aircraft carrier. The conversion work is being carried out by the Uraga Dockyard and is expected to be completed in January of next year.

<p>The League of Nations Political Council Concludes Today</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Cables Instructions to Geneva, Ordering Matsuoka to Insist on a Peaceful Resolution and Oppose Invoking Chapter 15 of the Covenant</h3>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting can be concluded tomorrow, and the Sino-Japanese issue will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. The Japanese Foreign Ministry's response to Matsuoka's request for instructions arrived at the Japanese delegation in Geneva at 7 p.m. on the 26th. Matsuoka immediately convened a meeting with representatives Nagaoka and Sato this morning to discuss the first step in dealing with the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with the instructions from the Foreign Ministry. The result was that Japan's difficulty in the League of Nations still lies with the representatives of small countries, so it intends to make every effort to lobby various small countries to seek unexpected results. Therefore, Matsuoka et al. will actively seek to lobby the Czech representative, who is the most powerful among the small countries, but it is difficult to predict the effect. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is paying close attention to this. (Far East News Agency dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government, in view of the transfer of the Manchurian issue to the General Assembly for discussion, believes that the League of Nations' attitude towards Japan will inevitably be unfavorable. Although it is threatening to withdraw from the League of Nations, the Japanese government is gradually realizing that this empty threat may not be effective for Japan. Therefore, it is trying to find a way to remedy the situation. Recently, Tokyo and the Japanese delegation in Geneva have been spreading rumors, saying that a certain major power's opinion on the Manchurian issue is gradually feeling that relying on the League of Nations will not be able to solve the problem in the end. It is still effective for China and Japan to negotiate directly, etc. This is a helpless propaganda to comfort oneself in an irremediable situation. (Far East News Agency dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The League of Nations Council's deliberation of the Sino-Japanese issue is gradually deteriorating, and the transfer of the issue to the General Assembly for discussion has also been determined. The Foreign Ministry believes that the future does not allow optimism. Today, although it is Sunday, Director-General of the Asian Bureau Tani and Chief of the First Section Morishima, etc., attended the Foreign Ministry to instruct the Japanese delegation in Geneva on the attitude it should take. The content of the instructions is that the Japanese delegation should oppose the convening of the General Assembly based on Article 15 of the Covenant at the Council meeting at 10 a.m. on the 28th. When the Council transfers the matter to the General Assembly for discussion, it should declare its reservation to attend the meeting and strongly advocate Japan's policy on the following points: The League of Nations should take the political settlement of all League of Nations disputes as its main mission, so when the Council transfers the Sino-Japanese issue to the General Assembly, it cannot let go of the issue and must maintain the right to intervene in this issue when necessary. It also ordered Representative Matsuoka to advocate the following three points at the Council meeting on the 28th based on the government's instructions in order to clarify the position of the Japanese government: 1) Japan opposes the transfer of the Manchurian issue to the temporary General Assembly convened in accordance with Article 15; 2) The sole purpose of the Japanese delegation's attendance at the General Assembly is to explain the position of the Japanese government. The view that the Manchurian issue should be reviewed by the Council cannot be changed; 3) The League of Nations can invoke Article 11 of the Covenant to resolve the Manchurian issue by peaceful means. Articles 1 to 3 of Article 15 are the same as Article 11, stipulating that it should be resolved by peaceful means, so Japan has no objection. However, the proposals from paragraph 4 onwards involve oppressive or coercive measures, and the Japanese government opposes all of them. (Japanese United Press dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Japan's Ambitions of Aggression are Unrestrained</p>
<h3>Finances Will Soon Be on the Verge of Crisis</h3>
<p>Observation by American White Moron</p>
<p>New York - American dignitary White Moron said in a speech at the New York Foreign Policy Discussion Conference today that even if the Japanese Imperial Government does not fail next year, it will suffer a major blow because Manchuria will soon become a major economic burden for the Japanese. It is now clear that although the Japanese have spent countless amounts of money to appease the people and calm the area in Manchuria, they have not succeeded so far. At this time, Japan is struggling to support the heavy burden of its military apparatus, but whether it can avoid stumbling will depend on the success or failure of the current military adventure. He also said that China also has serious political and financial problems. If it fails to seek remedies urgently, it will also suffer a major blow. (National News Agency dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>British and German Newspapers</p>
<h3>Comment on the Sino-Japanese Dispute</h3>
<p>London - The London Observer criticized today, saying that the result of a week of debate in Geneva has been extremely bad, and the authorities still seem to be unaware of its crisis. The newspaper rebuked the frivolousness of Western European comments, saying that those who demand war against Japan to uphold the League of Nations Covenant are the greatest enemies of this covenant. It also said that the only way to avoid war and general disasters is to show patient sympathy to both parties. According to the newspaper's Moscow dispatch, if Japan is not satisfied in Geneva, a Russo-Japanese agreement may be concluded, involving recognition of "Manchukuo" or a Russo-Manchukuo non-aggression treaty. Russian newspapers detail the situation of the Geneva Conference, but do not comment. They have neither supported China's demands nor welcomed Dr. Koo's remarks about the Tanaka Memorial. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Vossische Zeitung criticized the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting today, saying that Britain is now weaving its policy, expressing Anglo-Japanese friendship on various occasions, which is more important than a fair resolution of the Manchurian issue. The only country that truly wants to resolve the Manchurian issue is the United States. The United States fears that once the Kellogg-Briand Pact is broken, all peace guarantees will become illusions. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<h3>Xiong Bin Has Returned to Beijing from Shandong</h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian Asks the Central Government to Take Care of Military Pay</p>
<p>The Department Will Be Reduced in Size After Arriving at the Defense Area</p>
<p>Jinan - At 7:00 this morning, Han Fuqu convened a secret meeting in the provincial government with Chief Zhang Shaotang, Chairman Li Shuchun of the Republic, and Director of the Finance Department Tu Xiangrong to discuss and manage the province's military and political affairs. Han said that he decided to go to the countryside to inspect the people's suffering. All 38 million people in Shandong are closely related to our pain. If we can do it, we will do it for everyone to see. If we can't do it, let others do it. We must never take the money of the common people without relieving their suffering. At 9:30, Han took a car to inspect the counties of Changqing, Pingyin, Dong'a, and Dongping. The right wing is followed by Jiang Chuoou, Yao Yijia, and Zhang Liansheng. Before Han left, he told reporters that he could return in five or six days and then go to Jiaodong for inspection. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Jinan - Zhang Yue telegraphed from Hankou that the President was very understanding of the Jiaozhou affairs, so he decided to transfer Liu to Shandong. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Jinan - Han arrived in Changqing at 1:00 p.m. to inspect the prison. He also summoned civil servants for instructions early in the morning. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Jinan - Ge Guangting returned to Qingdao via Jinan from Beijing today. According to him, the Jiaozhou Road Council recently held a meeting in Beijing to pass a resolution to issue public bonds to redeem the Jiaozhou Road. However, it must be decided by the National Government whether the bonds should be issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Railway Bureau, or the people. The National Government must also issue an order that no matter the National Government or the local government, no road funds shall be raised. No troops are allowed to detain vehicles as security. Currently, the value of Japanese gold has fallen. With 40 million yen in Japanese debt, 32 million yuan in public bonds can be issued to redeem the road. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Jinan - Han dismissed Xu Yuanqing, the prosecutor of Changqing, for detaining people without explanation, and Liu Wenguang, the warden, for failing to improve the prison and treating prisoners badly.

<p>Jinan - Xiong Bin returned to Jinan from Qingdao at 7:00 a.m. on the 26th. Han went to the station to welcome him. Xiong talked about Liu's troops in Laiyang, the two training and special affairs regiments in Yexian, and the remaining independent brigade headquarters. When he was in Yexian on the 23rd, the division headquarters had already started. The Second Brigade took five ships to open to the south on the 23rd and arrived on the 26th. The cavalry artillery regiment and the engineer transport battalion took seven ships to continue to open. The ships must return in ten days. Since Liu's troops were ordered not to stay in Yantai, they waited for the ships to arrive before opening Yantai. It is estimated that it will take another three weeks to complete the opening. The central government hopes that the downsizing will be carried out in Shandong, but there is not enough time and it is not appropriate to rush it. The escape of a part of Laiyang was due to the news of the downsizing. Therefore, it is best to downsize in Zhejiang. Some people starved to death and committed suicide when Yexian's people were besieged, and some refugees were shot by the city when they left the city, which is very painful. Liu was satisfied with his departure and was also very satisfied with the thoughtful reception of Commander Shen of the Yantai Garrison. Liu claimed that there were places where he was sorry to Chairman Han. At 9:30, Xiong returned to Beijing with Secretary Xu Bangjian. (Special dispatch of the 26th)</p>

According to him, the ten ships prepared by Zhejiang and Fujian for Liu's troops to be stationed in Zhejiang and Fujian must travel back and forth twice, which will take about two to three weeks to transport everything. The Yantai-Longkou defense area is temporarily maintained by the navy to maintain order. The Yexian-Laiyang area is taken over by Han's team. He received reports from Navy Commander Shen and various places that Liu's troops had good order along the way when they left Yantai to board the ship. He was on duty every night. He met Liu many times in Yexian for three days. Liu sincerely expressed that he would always follow the orders of the Central Committee, but asked him to convey to the Central Government to find a way to take care of the department's military pay. In the future, he would never collect a penny from the local area. The downsizing of Liu's department will be reviewed and ordered by the Military and Political Department after arriving at the defense area. Liu's supplies have been prepared by the county magistrate of Wenzhou. As soon as the troops arrive, they will be returned in full. After Liu's cavalry regiment boarded the ship, they suddenly received an order from He's department to open to Pukou on the original ship and transfer to Chuzhou to garrison. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>

The remaining ships entered the port in the afternoon. The Provincial Government sent the fourth regiment leader of the security team, He Lingxiao, to take care of them. Brigade Commander Liang Lizhu of Liu contacted the county government to inquire about food. Because the local rice and wheat were insufficient, the county government sent personnel to Shanghai to purchase them. Han Dong, Liu's chief of staff, received a telegram from the division commander on the 27th stating that the artillery regiment and the engineer battalion were camping outside Yantai waiting for the ship to depart, and the cavalry had been loaded on four ships and set off south at 6:00 p.m. on the 26th. They encountered Wenzhou and then took a small round to Minbei to fill the defense. Han Dong believed that since the troops of the division had arrived in Wenzhou, he had to go ahead to arrange everything. He scheduled to take the special express train to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 28th to wait for the ship to go to Wenzhou. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>

He will go to Tianjin within a few days to investigate the salt tax increase case and return to the capital after completing it. The salt tax increase began in 1927, and over ten million has been collected to date. The use of this large sum cannot be ignored. (Dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3>The German Political Situation is Uncertain</h3>
<p>The Choice of the Person to Form the Cabinet Remains Undecided</p>
<p>Papen Expresses His Unwillingness to Continue as Premier</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from Berlin on the 26th that the German political situation remains uncertain at the end of this week, because President Hindenburg's appointment of a new premier requires that various issues be determined in advance, so the president may not take any action before Tuesday. The content of the discussions is extremely confidential, and most parties are unwilling to express their views. However, it is known that meetings are being held in the presidential palace almost day and night. Furthermore, although it is impossible to predict who the new premier will be, those familiar with the internal political situation say that Papen will no longer be appointed as premier, because Papen himself is unwilling to continue in the role. Therefore, Hindenburg not only has to find someone to continue forming a cabinet, but also a fundamental reorganization of the cabinet is considered a natural thing.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Sincere Reflections on the Completion of the Dike Project</h3>
<p>Last year, a flood caused devastation, with dikes and water conservancy projects in the provinces along the Yangtze River collapsing. The floodwaters swept across the land, causing widespread destruction. The National Government's Flood Relief Committee, in order to provide fundamental relief, not only provided emergency relief but also implemented work relief measures to repair various sections of the dikes. Now that the project has been completed, we reflect on the tragic situation of last year when massive waves engulfed everything and people and animals perished together. Seeing the successful completion of this great water conservancy project, we cannot help but feel extremely fortunate.</p>
<p>In the past, when we talked about the great buildings in our country, we would always mention the Great Wall. In fact, the function of the Great Wall in the Qin Dynasty was limited to defending against the Hu, and in recent times, its function has become even less visible. Moreover, its construction was built on the flesh and blood of ordinary people, a fortress to defend "one family's empire," attempting to maintain the inheritance of their descendants for ten thousand generations, and cannot escape the blame of countless generations to come. However, the current water conservancy project spans over 4,390 kilometers, passing through the Yangtze River, Min River, Xiang River, Yuan River, Huai River, Grand Canal, and other river basins in six provinces. Its grandeur is no less than that of the Great Wall, and its importance to the survival of tens of millions of people along the river is even more evident than the Great Wall of one family. This summer and autumn, the floodwaters were also great, but they did not cause a disaster. The greatness of the effectiveness of this thousands of miles of water conservancy project is even more evident. Work relief not only provided an opportunity for thousands of people who were lying down waiting to die and relying on relief to survive to support themselves, but also allowed the formerly intermittent dikes to be integrated into a unified plan, resulting in a greater effect. In the past, whenever a disaster occurred, we only focused on "relief." From the lesson of this work relief, we now understand that the way to provide disaster relief lies not only in "relief," but also in "work."</p>
<p>The Flood Relief Committee has invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai to participate in the dike construction completion ceremony in the capital today, and then to visit various project areas to inspect them. The Flood Relief Committee's huge expenses mostly came from social donations. Now that the project has been completed, those who enthusiastically donated in the past can personally inspect and witness that their donations have been transformed into a great project and have not been wasted. However, we believe that this matter is extremely important, and that this great construction during the national crisis after the great disaster has even deeper significance. Therefore, the Flood Relief Committee's invitation to various sectors to inspect is not to show off its achievements, and those who are invited to inspect also have a different meaning from ordinary tourism. We believe that this trip is deeply related to the water conservancy and people's livelihood of the provinces in the Yangtze River basin in the future.</p>
<p>We believe that the rolling river has fertile land on both sides. If irrigation is proper and the dikes are well maintained, then this rolling river will be enough to benefit the country and the people. However, because irrigation is improper and there are even no water conservancy projects to speak of, last year's flood caused the most severely affected area to reach 265,000 square kilometers, and the less affected area was also around 60,000 square kilometers, which is about the size of England or the state of New York. The affected population was at least 50 million, and many were homeless. Most countries in the world that are lower than the water level have been able to avoid disasters because they focus on water conservancy. Only our country has no choice but to wait for death when a flood comes. We still cannot help but shed tears when we recall the tragic situation of the country being submerged last year. Although the dike project has been completed, we can have some protection, but we still cannot have the idea of ​​"one labor for permanent peace" and think that we have something to rely on and are not afraid. Building a dike is difficult, and preventing dike failure is also difficult. Building a dike is an urgent task, and preventing dike failure is also important. Building but not preventing, or not being good at guarding, will mean that the dike project will be unimaginable in three or two years due to natural erosion. Therefore, in the future, we must carefully study the two issues of how to permanently maintain the dike project and how to use the dike project. Only by being able to use the dikes can the dike project not be abandoned, and only by being able to maintain the dikes can this great project last for a long time.</p>
<p>We are deeply fortunate for the completion of this great project, and we extend our sincere hopes to the government authorities and the gentlemen who are invited to inspect.</p>
<h3>The Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Pact Successfully Concluded</h3>
<p>Has Been Approved by the French Cabinet and is Scheduled to be Signed Tomorrow</p>
<h3>Content Provisions</h3>
<p>Mutual respect for territory and possessions, non-resort to war, neutrality in the event of aggression, suppression of boycott, and termination of propaganda</p>
<h3>Concentrating Efforts on Commercial Treaty Negotiations in the Future</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 26th—The French cabinet today approved the Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty, stipulating: ㈠ Respect for each other's territories, including colonies and protectorates; ㈡ Neither party shall engage in war; ㈢ If either party is subjected to aggression by a third party, the other party must remain neutral; ㈣ Suppression of boycott activities; ㈤ Termination of propaganda, especially through news forms. The Russian government guarantees not to promote or support anti-French propaganda and agitation. The treaty's wording prohibits Soviet Russia from supporting Russian revolutionary organizations within and outside the country that are detrimental to Annam, Syria, and North Africa. This treaty was concluded in Paris today and will be signed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th—The Mutual Non-Aggression Treaty between France and Soviet Russia was provisionally initialed on August 24th of last year by the Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry and the Soviet Russian Ambassador to France. This morning, Premier Herriot presented the treaty to the Council of State for discussion. The treaty begins with a preamble declaring that the treaty safeguards the League of Nations Covenant and reaffirms the Paris Peace Pact. Following the preamble, there are seven articles stipulating that the non-aggression pledge applies not only to France and its colonies but also to French protectorates and territories under French mandate from the League of Nations. Secondly, both countries mutually prohibit financial and economic boycotts, as well as propaganda activities that politically and socially harm the other country. Furthermore, neither contracting party shall tolerate the existence of any military organization within its territory that aims to attack the other contracting party by force. Additionally, Russian intellectual and mutual aid groups within France shall continue to enjoy the protection afforded to those exiled abroad due to political issues. This Non-Aggression Treaty is modeled after the German-Russian Treaty, with improvements. The non-aggression treaty also includes a conciliation treaty, as Soviet Russia, due to its different political system, is unwilling to recognize the arbitration system and wishes to submit disputes that may arise between the two countries to a conciliation body for review. This body has various powers, including the appointment of experts and the provision of recommendations to the governments concerned. Its nature is similar to the Bryan Commission organized after 1910 when the United States had not yet recognized the principle of arbitration. It is noted that France and Soviet Russia still need to conduct commercial negotiations. The signing of this mutual non-aggression treaty will not hinder the success of commercial negotiations. If political and commercial issues are intertwined, it is difficult to gain an accurate understanding of the various elements of each issue. Separate negotiations can avoid this drawback. France and Russia are signing a non-aggression treaty while proceeding with commercial negotiations, completely separating the two matters. Now that the political issue has been resolved, it will be easier to concentrate on commercial treaty negotiations in the future.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th—The Franco-Russian Mutual Non-Aggression Treaty was passed by the Council of State this morning. Since 1922, most European countries have been negotiating and concluding mutual non-aggression treaties. The conclusion of the French treaty marks the end of such negotiations, and Europe's "Non-Aggression Treaty" policy has been successfully completed. Between 1925 and 1927, the Moscow government successively concluded friendship treaties or mutual non-aggression treaties with Turkey, Germany, Afghanistan, Lithuania, and Persia. Furthermore, Soviet Russia believed that the Non-War Pact would take a long time to implement. Therefore, in 1928, it suggested to neighboring countries that they conclude a special treaty, with the signatory countries agreeing to implement the Paris Non-War Pact. In 1929, Soviet Russia, Poland, Romania, and the Baltic countries signed this special treaty in Moscow. In 1930, the Soviet Russian government again expressed its willingness to conclude a special treaty with Poland and France, and negotiations immediately commenced. As a result, mutual non-aggression treaties were signed with Finland, Estonia, and Latvia in early 1932 and ratified. In January 1932, Poland provisionally initialed its mutual non-aggression treaty with Russia, which was formally signed in July but not immediately ratified, allowing Romania sufficient time to negotiate a similar treaty with Soviet Russia. However, negotiations between Romania and Soviet Russia failed due to a dispute over the territory of Bessarabia. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu declared to the Romanian Parliament that Romania still hoped that its allies could sign a mutual non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia according to the planned schedule. Therefore, French Premier Herriot believed that the Franco-Russian mutual non-aggression treaty, which had already been initialed, should be formally signed at this time and should not be delayed any further. Moreover, Soviet Russia declared to the French government that it would adopt a policy of understanding and would not use violence to resolve the dispute with Romania. Therefore, France had an even greater need to sign the non-aggression treaty. In the same declaration, the Romanian Foreign Minister also requested France to mediate with Romania, so that Soviet Russia would allow Romania to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, based on the foundation agreed upon by Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Romanian Minister to Paris, Gafencu, within four months from the date of signing the Franco-Russian treaty. The numerous negotiations conducted by a large part of Europe to build peace have now come to an end. We still recall that until now, there has been only one political treaty signed between Russia and a major European power, namely the Treaty of Berlin, concluded between the two countries after the German-Russian Treaty of Rapallo in 1922 (1926). The Treaty of Berlin stipulated that Russia would remain neutral if Germany were attacked. This time, the Franco-Russian treaty stipulates that Russia would remain neutral if France were attacked. The two treaties complement each other and can add another layer of credibility and guarantee to Europe. In view of this point, the importance of the Franco-Russian mutual non-aggression treaty can be imagined.</p>
<p>Romania Abandons Treaty with Russia</p>
<h3>Polish-Soviet Treaty Also to be Ratified</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th—It is reported that the Polish government will ratify the Polish-Soviet Mutual Non-Aggression Treaty tomorrow. Furthermore, Romania has abandoned its intention to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia. In an effort to remedy the situation, the Soviet Union, at the request of the French government, will attach a special declaration to the aforementioned two treaties.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 26th—Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu stated to our correspondent, "Romania is delighted to hear that the Franco-Russian Mutual Non-Aggression Treaty will soon be signed. The rapprochement between France, Poland, and the Soviet Union is extremely beneficial to Romania. As for Romania not concluding a mutual non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, it will not have any impact on Romania's alliances with other countries or the friendly relations between Russia and other countries, because Romania loves peace and there is a Non-War Pact."</p>
<p>New Governor-General of the Free State</p>
<h3>British Emperor Appoints Buckley</h3>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 26th—The British Emperor has appointed Buckley as the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The people of the Irish Free State find this appointment quite unexpected. Buckley participated in the revolution in 1916 and was later arrested. He was released during the general amnesty of that year. As a member of the Irish Parliament, Buckley voted against accepting the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In last year's election, Buckley was not elected and has since been engaged in business. An official at the London Free State office told Reuters today that the new Governor-General is respected by people of all levels in Ireland. Buckley will soon meet the British Emperor at Buckingham Palace. He took the oath of allegiance somewhere near Dublin today. It has not yet been decided whether he will reside in the Governor-General's residence. Buckley will receive a full salary of £10,000 but may return part of it.</p>
<h3>Wartime Cloaking Device</h3>
<p>Using Optics to Invent Steel Armor</p>
<p>The Result of Four Years of Research by a Spanish Engineer</p>
<p>Havas, Madrid, 27th—The Min Sheng Bao reports that the new invention of engineer Olmedo is about to be formally tested. This invention is a steel armor that can make soldiers invisible to the enemy. The method uses a mirror, placed at a specific angle in front of the soldier or equipment to be hidden. The mirror reflects a portion of the ground in front of the mirror, so that the enemy only sees a piece of land and not the soldier or equipment hidden behind the mirror. According to Olmedo, it took four years of research to achieve this result, inspired by the mimicking abilities of certain animals, such as chameleons.</p>
<p>British Cabinet Meets Today</p>
<h3>Discussing War Debt Issue</h3>
<p>Reply to the US in Drafting</p>
<p>Details Reasons for Requesting Deferred Payment</p>
<p>France and Belgium Also Express</p>
<p>Inability to Pay Due US Debt</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th—The cabinet will likely meet on Sunday to discuss the war debt issue. Prime Minister MacDonald will first hold informal talks with Foreign Secretary Simon and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain tomorrow. According to reliable sources, a draft of the British reply can be submitted to the Prime Minister for review tomorrow. The document will detail Britain's reasons for requesting a deferral of the debt due in December, in preparation for revising the entire war debt. If the war debt issue across the Atlantic is not first studied, the facts will compel a renewed discussion of the reparations issue and the war debt issue, resulting in the harm and unexpected changes that the Lausanne Conference has already eliminated. The result will delay the recovery of global commerce. Yesterday, Chamberlain stated that in this second note, Britain will detail the reasons for requesting a deferral. President Hoover has acknowledged that requesting free discussion of the debt issue is reasonable, so Mr. Hoover apparently does not oppose using this method to reopen the war debt for discussion. Chamberlain expressed satisfaction on this point. As for the final attitude of the US Congress on the issue of deferring next month's debt payment or on the larger debt itself, it is not yet possible to make rash judgments. Well-informed newspapers all acknowledge that negotiations with the US on the issue of next month's payment are unrelated to Britain's ability to pay, but are related to whether the US should accept this payment. The Times' reporter explicitly stated that this issue is of great importance and is not only related to Britain but to the entire world. The Manchester Guardian believes that even if this clause is not included in Britain's new note, it will serve as the background for the overall situation. This payment is indeed sufficient to hinder the recovery of global prosperity, just as the reduced reparations are now being paid. The newspaper concluded that its recent impact will be fluctuating exchange rates, further downward pressure on prices, the Lausanne Agreement becoming waste paper, and the world economic conference being plunged into danger.</p>
<p>Le Matin, Paris, 26th—The government recently announced that it expects a shortfall of 56 billion francs at the end of the current fiscal year, and newspapers are using this as a reason to oppose paying the US debt due on December 15th.</p>
<p>Le Matin, Brussels, 27th—According to responsible sources here, the Belgian government intends to send a note to the US State Department stating that the Belgian government is completely unable to pay the war debt due on December 15th. The Belgian government regrets that the US government has refused to extend the deadline. Even if the US does not collect this payment, it will not be hindered. However, this must wait until the British and French governments decide on the war debt before deciding whether to issue it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th—The US replies to Poland and Czechoslovakia's requests for deferral of war debts were sent out today. The gist is the same as the replies sent to Britain, France, and Belgium: neither extending the deferral period nor agreeing to consider it, but only stating that the US President will ask Congress to re-examine the main issue of war debts.</p>
<h3>US "Wet" Faction Rises</h3>
<p>Amending the Prohibition Law</p>
<p>Congress Will Vote to Decide</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th—The House of Representatives may vote on the first day of its meeting next month to decide on the proposal to repeal the 18th Amendment (i.e., the Prohibition Law). Congressman Rainey supported this proposal today, stating that many Republican and Democratic Congressmen who are unwilling to support the beer bill can vote to decide whether to abandon it. A majority vote is required to abolish prohibition, but in recent months, many people have changed from supporting prohibition to advocating for relaxation, so he believes that the House of Representatives will definitely pass it.</p>

<p>Heilongjiang Correspondence: Although Japan is chanting that the League of Nations has no power and that Japan will proceed with its established policy regarding the League of Nations Council convened in Geneva on October 21st, on the other hand, apart from the ruffians in the Northeast who are lawless and engage in open bribery for profit, the Japanese who have some knowledge hold a calm attitude, neither involving themselves in politics nor investing in businesses. When asked why, they reply that the current situation has not yet reached a stable point and that everything is a transitional era. If "Manchukuo" does not face any major difficulties and can be maintained permanently, then the people currently serving in Manchuria are not dispatched by the government and will naturally be replaced. If there are changes in the future, then whether or not to be active at this time is irrelevant. This proves that the Japanese attitude is completely strong on the outside but weak on the inside. In fact, they are cautiously proceeding step by step to test the international trend towards them. Since the publication of the Lytton Report, the entire puppet state has been terrified. At the same time, the various righteous armies are like drinking an exhilarating tonic, vying to recover lost territory. Except for the five major cities of Jilin, Changchun, Harbin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, everywhere else is surrounded by righteous armies. Fearing that the righteous armies would indeed make a loud declaration during the League of Nations meeting, which would be tantamount to openly providing the League of Nations with strong evidence proving that the puppet state was not established by the self-determination of the 30 million people of Manchuria, the Japanese have recently been extremely apprehensive, vigorously attacking righteous armies in various places and prohibiting newspapers outside the customs from publishing their military news to prevent leaks. In addition, they are forcing Chinese groups in various places to draft telegrams according to the main points of opposing the Lytton Investigation Report, drafted by their military police and special service agencies, and send them to Geneva via Japan. The puppet state representative, Ding Shiyuan, then compiles and submits them to Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative attending the League of Nations, for forwarding to the Council. The main points of the anti-report, which the military police deliver to each group, are as many as forty, generally stating that "Manchukuo" was established by the 30 million people suffering from the oppression of the old warlords and seeking self-determination, with the assistance of allied countries. All Japanese officials who have joined "Manchukuo" have obtained legal "Manchukuo" citizenship. The Lytton Report is biased, listens only to one side, and is too unfair. The League of Nations should organize another investigation team to come to "Manchukuo" for investigation, etc. Zhang Jinghui, Li Shaogeng, Zang Shiyi, Han Yunjie, and others have drafted one copy of this anti-report telegram each. Commercial groups draft one to three copies, and elementary school students also draft one copy per grade. Other private individuals with some reputation also draft one copy. Most of the people drafting telegrams, except for traitors, are forced and unable to escape, so they connect the various points within the designated scope and perfunctorily comply. The most ridiculous thing is that elementary school students, not even ten years old, are also forced to draft anti-report documents. Each elementary school has no choice but to have teachers write on their behalf, or have students write ten or twenty words at random and send them in. The Japanese only need to have the original copy and do not care about the skill of the writing, and they are all telegraphed to Geneva according to the original text. Perhaps this childish trick will be seen at the League of Nations meeting in the future. The Northeastern newspapers, all those run by Chinese, are now under extreme pressure. Before the League of Nations has even convened, the Japanese military police have issued a notice stating that they must not publish news other than that of the Japanese United Press, and must not carry pessimistic articles about the puppet state. The Japanese United Press provides dozens of telegrams to each newspaper every day, all of which are propaganda in nature, and each newspaper must pay to purchase them, and must publish them without omission, without selection, and especially without deletion or modification. This is truly unprecedented suppression in the world. Apart from a portion who are willing to flatter Japan and spare no effort to promote and praise the Japanese, the others are lifeless. It is expected that when the League of Nations convenes, Northeastern newspapers will have no way to find real news, and even if they obtain news, they will not dare to publish it.

<h3>Japanese Consul Yamazaki's Report on the Incident Diary</h3>
<p>Since Su Bingwen's rebellion, the Manzhouli Railway Protection Army also clashed with the Japanese police force. Japanese Consul Yamazaki besieged the area, unable to escape. The Chinese and Russian consuls mediated several times, but due to the hostile actions of some Cantonese Railway Protection Army personnel among the Japanese residents, the Railway Protection Army headquarters did not allow it. The following is an abridged translation of Consul Yamazaki's diary, as reported to the Japanese government by the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo.</p>
<p>September 27, 10:00 AM—Received a phone call from Wu Delin, Deputy Commander of the local Railway Protection Army, inviting me and Captain Ohara and Lieutenant Yano to the headquarters for a discussion. I took Secretary Fukama and went to the headquarters with Captain Ohara in a carriage. After a strict inspection by the guards, we entered the reception room on the upper floor. Gunfire suddenly broke out inside the room and in the city. Shortly thereafter, the regular aircraft between Qiqihar and Manzhouli soared into the sky. The Chinese soldiers immediately opened fire. The aircraft, realizing the danger, immediately landed and transported Mr. Sayama, the Manchurian resident of the company, back to Qiqihar. Commander Wu was quite angry with the Railway Protection Army towards the Japanese police and stated that he had no way to suppress it, requesting that the police force be disarmed immediately. I agreed to his request, knowing that the four to five hundred soldiers of the Railway Protection Army could not be defeated by a small number of police officers. Subsequently, Captain Uno decided to exchange the protection of the lives and property of the remaining members of the team and the residents. I issued a disarming order to Captain Uno's team, which was carried by Secretary Fukama. Captain Uno had previously instructed the police force by phone, but the police force continued to fire fiercely. As a result, the Railway Protection Army returned fire, causing Secretary Fukama to be unable to advance. He turned back and asked Captain Uno to call the police force again. At that time, I also knew that if the disarming was not carried out quickly, the situation would worsen, and I immediately ordered all members to go to the battlefield to explain the advantages and disadvantages, leaving only me at the headquarters. Secretary Fukama, under the pretext of comforting the residents, was able to return to the consulate. Later, Captain Uno and Commander Wu went to the police headquarters to observe the situation of the second defense line of the Railway Protection Army. Captain Uno alone told the soldiers that they would disarm. Then, he returned to the headquarters with Captain Ohara and Commander Wu. Secretary Fukama, as previously agreed and with the permission of Commander Wu, was escorted by three soldiers to break through the defense line on the way and return to the consulate. The consulate was silent, and the doors were tightly closed. After about twenty minutes, I also returned to the consulate. Sugii, the police chief of the consulate, sent Officer Shiozaki as an escort and set off in a carriage, ordering the officer to inspect the barracks area. About twenty minutes later, I was surrounded by Chinese soldiers. At that time, there were only six officers. I gathered the staff inside a corner of the consulate to resist the invasion of the Chinese soldiers. At the same time, I ordered Secretary Matiba and Officer Nakazawa to burn the telegraph codes. On one hand, I ordered the foreign women and the families of the staff to gather inside the consulate, totaling no more than thirty-one people. However, there were only a few pistols in the consulate, making it difficult to resist. At this time, the officer who went to the front line to observe the situation reported the situation outside. Shortly thereafter, Secretary Fukama returned to the consulate and reported that the police force had been disarmed. I then realized that we had no defensive power. Matsui, the police chief, and the other six police officers had no choice but to abandon their weapons and adopt a policy of non-resistance. I also knew that the situation was urgent and urged the staff to burn the seals and confidential documents. At this time, it was difficult to connect by phone, and the consulate was heavily surrounded. Since it was impossible to move freely, I had to send a secret envoy through the back door to sneak to the Soviet consulate, asking them to negotiate with the Railway Protection Army to withdraw from Manzhouli. The Soviet consul said that he needed the permission of the Chinese government before he could prepare vehicles. I knew that withdrawal was impossible. At 5:30 PM, several officers and soldiers came to investigate the weapons inside the consulate. I handed over the nine pistols of the police officers inside the consulate. Afterwards, they inspected the weapons inside the houses of the Japanese residents. Fortunately, with the help of Chinese Officer Zhou, I went to Ichido Street to investigate and rescue the foreigners and inquired about the damage situation. Except for the residents on Sido Street and Godo Street, all were accommodated in the consulate. Officer Zhou returned to the consulate at 1:00 AM on the 28th. At that time, the Border Protection Police Force, following Captain Uno's order, disarmed all members and imprisoned them in the office of the police station. After disarming, Captain Uno went to the Railway Protection Army headquarters with Captain Ohara. At night, Officer Shiozaki did not return, and the gunfire on Sido Street and Godo Street was mixed, and the consulate was surrounded by armed soldiers, causing extreme terror. Everyone stayed up all night, suffering greatly.</p>
<p>28th—The staff could not go out a step. Postal and telegraph services were strictly prohibited. At 11:00 AM, Liang, a lieutenant colonel, visited and accommodated the foreigners and the families of the police force on Sido Street and Godo Street in the consulate. At 2:10 PM, a Japanese aircraft flew over the consulate. Everyone gathered in the consulate was very excited and came out of the ceiling, holding up the Japanese flag to indicate that they were safe. At 2:30 PM, I used the phone to ask the Russian consul to relay the message from Chita to Vladivostok to Ambassador Hirota, begging the foreigners to return to their country via Vladivostok. At noon, a Chinese regiment leader visited, verbally describing the movements of Ohara and Uno and offering to send them back to the consulate. However, at 3:00 PM, the commander of the Railway Protection Army suddenly telegraphed that he was unwilling to escort Captain Ohara and Captain Uno.</p>
<p>29th—At 10:00 AM, I borrowed 3,000 yuan from the Russian consul. The Russian consul still replied that he needed the permission of China. On the other hand, Takahashi Tomiko disguised himself as a Russian woman and was accommodated among the Russian refugees.</p>
<p>30th—At noon, two or three Chinese squad leaders and soldiers searched the consulate for weapons. At 4:00 PM, the Russian consul sent 3,000 yuan, entrusting him to deliver 1,000 yuan to the Hailar dispatcher. In the afternoon, to purchase food, the Civil Society dispatched a member to the market under the supervision of Chinese guards.</p>
<p>October 1st—At 11:00 AM, Zheng Wenfu, adjutant to the headquarters, visited and asked about the situation of Ohara and Uno. Subsequently, by order of the Railway Protection Army headquarters, he came to the consulate every day to report on the safety of Ohara and Uno. However, the Russian side said that sending money to Hailar required the consent of Su Bingwen. At 4:00 PM, Wang, Li, Chen, and other three adjutants, along with several guards, visited, saying that they had received a secret report that Japanese were hiding and resisting behind the roof of Japanese merchant Hirashima Shichisuke's house and planned to go with Secretary Fukama to inspect. They also brought Commander Wu's official document. Thus, Fukama and Shiraishi went to investigate the condition of nearby houses.</p>
<p>October 2nd—For days, it has been quite troublesome to purchase food. The headquarters dispatched Peng Shaojiang, adjutant to the consulate. At 10:00 AM, Adjutant Zheng came again and asked the adjutant to take out bedding and clothes from Captain Uno's house. At 4:00 PM, it was delivered as promised. At 5:00 PM, Secretary Fukama negotiated with Adjutant Zheng for the reconciliation of member Hito Hira, and requested the release of Miura Kamezo and two Koreans. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Opium Ban in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence. The formerly model province, now transformed into a den of demons, Shanxi, has seen a proliferation of narcotics in recent years. It could also be called a national model. In the central counties, such as Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, and Pingyao, traditionally known for their wealth, the sales volume of "white powder" (i.e., heroin) reaches over 300,000 taels annually (each tael valued at around sixty or seventy yuan). In the southern and southeastern regions, such as Xinjiang, Yuncheng, Jincheng, and Changzhi, "red pills" (i.e., gold pills, known as "red pills" by the Shanxi people) are widespread and can be said to be fashionable. If a stranger travels from Yuci to Changzhi or Yuncheng (the former being over 600 li away, the latter over 900 li), every small shop along the route sells white powder and red pills, allowing them to indulge their habit. Even during these times of strict prohibition, the northern counties of Yanbei, though poorer, have naturally seen a slight reduction in the influx of high-quality imported powder. However, after being occupied by the Fengtian Army outside the Yanmen Pass, tens of thousands of acres of fertile land were converted to growing opium poppies, and the production of "black goods" (opium) is likely comparable to that of neighboring Shaanxi, which previously held a monopoly on its cultivation. Over the past twenty years, China has been plagued by natural disasters, epidemics, and the ravages of soldiers and bandits. Shanxi, compared to other regions, could have been considered a paradise on earth. However, even though this paradise had not suffered from war or banditry before, the evil flames of narcotics had long since anesthetized most of the people, bringing them to the brink of death.</p>
<p>When the Cabinet resigned the year before last, and Shanxi banknotes ceased to be redeemable in silver, the rural economy, which had been shaken, faced complete bankruptcy. The sustenance of over a hundred thousand mercenary troops depended entirely on the burden borne by the common people. Extortion and levies appeared endlessly. Despite all efforts to extract funds, the government authorities could not resolve the financial difficulties. Consequently, the government had to find other ways to open up new sources of revenue and stop past substantial leakages. This new policy was "strict enforcement of the opium ban."</p>
<p>The so-called "strict enforcement of the opium ban" involves the provincial government inviting local celebrities to form a "Committee for the Investigation and Prohibition of Narcotics." Any powder or pill peddlers caught are sent to military court for trial. Regardless of the quantity sold, as long as it can be proven that they were selling, they are sentenced to death. Since the establishment of the Narcotics Prohibition Committee in October of the twentieth year of the Republic, prison carts filled with powder peddlers are commonly seen heading to Xin Nanmen to be executed by firing squad. In the past year or so, the number of those sent to their deaths has numbered in the hundreds, including several women. Naturally, we have no sympathy for these pests who harm the country and endanger the people. However, we cannot help but pity those small-time powder peddlers, most of whom only sell two or three qian, or half a tael or one tael. The truly large-scale dealers are rarely caught. Driven by family burdens and the pressures of making a living, they have no choice but to take this risk. Although the enforcement is so strict, whether the narcotics can be eradicated is another matter. The reality is exactly the opposite of the original intention. While the small-time peddlers are gradually eliminated, this creates a wonderful opportunity for the big dealers to get rich. For instance, a certain army stationed in southern Shanxi openly deals in narcotics on a large scale, taking advantage of transportation and the organization of the military. Who would dare to touch a hair on their heads? Those who are addicted cannot help but use, and those who deal cannot resist the lure of profit.</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Official Medicine" sold exclusively by the "Village Administration Office" of the provincial government, namely, anti-addiction pills, contains 70% opium as its raw material. The annual sales amount to about 1.5 million yuan. Because it is difficult to sell them, the government has to step up improvements in order to compete with white powder and red pills. What kind of improvements? The result is a new type of pure raw paste called "Anti-Addiction Medicine Cakes." These cakes are made from opium. How is this raw material obtained? After the war in Yanbei, all the fertile land outside the pass was used to grow opium poppies. When the Fengtian Army withdrew, the harvest was purchased by the Shanxi provincial government. There was talk of lifting the opium ban last year, but it was halted after opposition from the public. Since May of this year, about two thousand boxes of anti-addiction medicine cakes (each box weighing fifteen kilograms, i.e., twenty-four jin) have been sent out by post offices every month. We cannot but admire the sincerity of our government in banning opium. Is it because too few people are seeking treatment? In August of this year, a large number of opium prohibition commissioners were specially appointed and stationed in various counties to implement the ban and exclusively promote the sale of official medicine. In addition to a salary of thirty yuan each commissioner can earn a commission of ten percent on the sale of official medicine. Thus, a large number of commissioner bosses, full of authority, have taken office.</p>
<p>"Strict enforcement of the opium ban" means that both white and black goods are forbidden for sale, but official medicine is an exception. Doesn't the government realize that the people of Shanxi's addiction will only deepen? The intangible losses and monetary consumption are insignificant compared to the loss of physical strength, which is a real loss to the nation. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this. (November 21st)</p>
<p>Xiong Bin Returns to Beijing After Finishing His Work</p>
<h3>The Situation of Liu's Troops Being Transferred and the Issue of Downsizing</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Xiong Bin, the Chief of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, went from Jinan to Laiyang on the 18th of this month to oversee the transfer and departure of Liu Zhennian's troops. He left Laiyang on the 23rd, went to Qingdao via Weixian, and met with Naval Commander Shen Honglie. On the evening of the 25th, he took the Jiaoji train west from Qingdao and arrived in Jinan this morning (the 26th) at 7:00 a.m. Governor of Shandong Province Han Fuju, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Mayor of Jinan Wen Chenglie, and Chief of the Public Works Bureau Tu Kairu, among others, all went to welcome him. After alighting from the train, Xiong went to the Jiaoji Hotel with Han and others to rest. According to what Xiong told reporters, the results of his trip to Laiyang were satisfactory. Currently, in Laiyang, only two regiments of instructors and special agents remain; in Laizhou, only one independent brigade and the division headquarters remain. When he left Laiyang on the 23rd, the division headquarters had already set out. The military department dispatched a total of twelve transport ships to Yantai. The second brigade of Liu's troops filled five ships, which had already set sail on the 23rd and are expected to arrive at their destination today. The remaining seven ships can load the artillery regiment, cavalry regiment, engineer regiment, and logistics battalion that are heading to Yantai. The ships need four days to travel from Yantai to Wenzhou, one day for upstream rest, and another four days to return from Wenzhou to Yantai, for a total of ten days round trip. Since the military department ordered Liu's division to depart as soon as it arrives, without waiting in Yantai, they have to wait for the ships to return before departing. It is estimated that they will be able to completely depart Shandong in another three weeks. As for the downsizing issue, the central government originally intended to complete it before the transfer, but the military department's order was issued on the 17th, and the troops in Laiyang had already set out on the 17th, so there was not enough time. Therefore, it is hoped that the downsizing will be done after arriving at the new defense area. I also suggested that it should not be done in too much of a hurry. A mutiny occurred in a part of Liu's troops in Laiyang on the 24th, which was due to the anxiety caused by the news of the downsizing. I am eager to return to Beijing not only because the mission of overseeing the troop withdrawal has been completed, but also because I urgently want to report this matter to the central government. After arriving in Beijing, I plan to first meet with Minister He to report, and then telegraph Chairman Chiang for instructions. Whether to go to Wuhan or not will depend on Chairman Chiang's reply. When Liu's troops first arrived in Laiyang to defend the city, the order was quite chaotic, but it has recently improved. The departure was indeed without much disturbance. I have instructed them to release the vehicles that were requisitioned after they arrive in Yantai, and they have agreed. They are very satisfied with the central government's arrangements. The people of Laiyang suffered greatly this time. During the siege, some starved to death, some threw themselves into wells, and on one occasion, a group of refugees who had just left the city were caught in a misunderstanding and shot, resulting in many deaths. It is very distressing. The damage to the houses in the city is still small, mostly in the west and south gates, which were demolished by Liu's army to clear the line of sight. Liu claims that his troops suffered few casualties. In short, what I am most concerned about is the issue of downsizing, because Yantai and Longkou have a mix of Chinese and foreigners, so it must be done carefully to avoid accidents. Downsizing in Zhejiang would be more appropriate. I will report this idea to the central government, and so on. At 9:30, Xiong boarded the Pingpu southbound train back to Beijing. Han Fuju and other important figures all went to the station to see him off. (November 26th)</p>
<h3>Planning the Construction of a Major Northern Port</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee Has Been Established</p>
<p>Zhang Hanying Hired as Chief Engineer</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Preparations for a major northern port have now begun. The Preparatory Committee has now invited Zhang Hanying, the Chief of the Higher Education Section of the Shandong Education Department, to be the Chief Engineer. (Zhang is the current president of the Shandong Engineering Society and formerly an engineer at Huludao.) After being hired, Zhang has resigned from his position as section chief in the department. This evening (the 24th) at 6:40, he took the Pingpu Train 202 from Jinan to Tianjin. According to people in engineering circles, the location of the major northern port is in Leting County, between the Daqing River and the Can River. The terrain is suitable. This place is suitable not only because it was designated by Sun Yat-sen, but also because it is actually the best harbor in northern China. Five li from the coast, the water is thirty feet deep, allowing very large ships to dock. Compared to Huludao, Huludao has more mountains, so the water is deeper, making port construction easier, but building city houses is more difficult. This place has no mountains, making port construction more difficult, but building city houses is very easy. China's only good northern port, Qinhuangdao, is not under our sovereignty. The painstaking efforts of twenty years in Huludao were also abandoned halfway, which is very disheartening. At this time, building a major northern port is essential. Once the construction is successful, the prosperity will definitely be above that of Tianjin. It can become the only port for North China, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan Mongolia. Products can be exported from here. This year, Suiyuan produced a surplus of wheat, and some was even burned. If this port is established, it can be transported and sold from here.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>From this, the importance of this port is self-evident. Both the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways are paying close attention to it. An office has been set up near the Wei River, and the Preparatory Office is located in Tianjin. There are currently two engineers stationed there to measure tides, and climate, record rainfall, test the strata, and produce a 1/10,000 scale map to carry out various preparations for port construction, and measure the Gu Tai station feeder line. Roughly, the preparation and design will take about five years. The project cost is estimated at fifty or sixty million yuan. As for how many years it will take to complete, it is still difficult to predict at this time. The Preparatory Committee has a total of five members. The chairman of the committee is Li Shutian, and the engineer is Zhang Hanying. Below them are engineers. (November 24th)</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Hosts the Beiping Press</p>
<h3>Report on the Trip South</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th) at 3:00 p.m., Zhang Xueliang met with the Beiping press at the Shuncheng Wang Mansion. More than fifty reporters attended. They were first received by Shen Nengyi and others, and then Mr. Zhang appeared and reported on his recent trip south. The reporters also raised eight questions: (1) The situation of meeting Chiang and Soong in Wuhan; (2) Japanese propaganda claims that Zhang's trip to Hangzhou was related to national defense issues, what is the truth; (3) Whether he will attend the Third Plenary Session, and whether he has any proposals; (4) Is it true that the antiques of the Forbidden City will be moved to Luoyang for safekeeping, and what are Zhang's opinions on the preservation of antiques; (5) There are many rumors about Feng Yuxiang, what is the truth; (6) The recent situation of bandit suppression in the three provinces and the pursuit of the Xu Xiangqian and He Long factions; (7) The progress of the Su Ma situation in Heilongjiang Province; (8) The situation on the border of Rehe. Mr. Zhang answered them one by one, as detailed below.</p>
<p>Reasons for going to Wuhan and Hangzhou: The reasons for my trip to Wuhan were no more than the following three points: (1) Regarding the military and political affairs of the North, I had not met with Chairman Chiang for a long time to discuss them. In addition, the Military Branch Council has been reorganized and established, and I am the acting chairman, so I went to Wuhan to report and fulfill my personal responsibilities; (2) Chairman Chiang originally planned to come to the North to meet with me. I thought that Chiang was planning the suppression of bandits in Wuhan, and the affairs were important, so I went to meet him and asked Chiang not to come; (3) I met with Minister Soong to discuss the finances of the North. Everyone knows that the finances of the North are difficult. When I visited Soong, I discussed whether there were other ways to solve the problem. You are asking me today, and I think this is also the reason. I met with Chairman Chiang twice during my trip to Wuhan. Minister Soong returned to Shanghai in a hurry to handle the affairs of the China Merchants Bureau. Before leaving, he asked me to go to Hangzhou to continue the discussion. I originally planned to go with him, but I rested for a while, so Soong went first, and I flew to Hangzhou the next day to meet with Soong and continue to discuss financial issues. At the same time, I also visited the Aviation School. Although I did not completely finish the discussion with Minister Soong, the general results were already achieved. Soong returned to Shanghai first, and I also left Hangzhou to return to Wuhan, where I bid farewell to Chiang and returned north. The rumors that I went to Hangzhou were related to national defense are purely unfounded. Why would national defense affairs be discussed in Hangzhou? In fact, Minister Soong returned to Shanghai because of the China Merchants Bureau issue, and he had not had time to discuss it in detail in Wuhan, so he asked me to continue the meeting in Hangzhou. Minister Luo also asked me to meet in Nanjing, but I declined because I was anxious to return to the North.</p>
<p>The issue of the antiques of the Forbidden City: The Third Plenary Session is about to open, and whether I will go to Nanjing to attend will depend on the situation. I am not prepared at the moment. I am a supervisory member, and it doesn't matter whether I attend or not. I have no proposals for the conference. After Supervisory Committee members Gao and Zhou arrived in Beiping, I have not met with them. I will not express any opinions on this issue. I have only seen the news about moving the antiques to Luoyang, and I don't know the details.</p>
<p>Rumors about Feng are unfounded: There are many rumors about Mr. Feng Yuxiang. As far as I know, Mr. Feng is unfairly treated. Mr. Feng likes to talk, which is a sign that he is not indifferent to the country. He cannot but speak. I am very confident that Mr. Feng has no other actions. The rumors are not credible. Song Mingxuan (Zhe Yuan) resigned from his position as chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government is another matter and has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>The situation of bandit suppression in the three provinces: Regarding the situation of bandit suppression in the three provinces, I met with Chief of Staff Cao Haosen of the General Headquarters in Wuhan. According to him, the bandit suppression is being carried out in two directions, south and north of the Yangtze River. At present, only two factions remain in the north, Xu Xiangqian and He Long. He Long's troops have only three thousand people left and are powerless. Xu's troops have more than ten thousand people, and there are more guns than people. The pursuing troops found many branches of juniper on the backs of the horses left behind by Xu's troops, which can be used as proof. At present, all parties are paying close attention to Xu's troops. Xu was a student at Whampoa Military Academy and had worked in political work in Shaanxi. This time, he pasted slogans along the way, calling for "Opening up the international route." The goal is probably the Shaanxi-Gansu area. Chairman Chiang has ordered troops to thoroughly pursue and suppress them, which will not be difficult to solve. In any case, we cannot allow Xu's troops to sneak into Shaanxi, otherwise, it will not only be difficult to solve, but also affect the security of the North. I met with Zhang Fang, who is in charge of post-war rehabilitation in southern Henan. What he has seen and heard must be the truth. Regarding the brutal behavior of the Communists in southern Henan, he has taken many photos. One photo shows the heads of people killed by the Communists, piled up with no less than several thousand, including the heads of infants, which can be described as extremely tragic. Zhang also personally saw places marked as "killing fields" in every county he visited, with as many as seven or eight in each place. It is conceivable how violent they were. I have also heard about the tragic murder of Yue Weijun by the Communists. It is said that Yue was hung up and beaten once a day after being captured. Sometimes, when Yue's relatives and friends sent money, he would be treated better for a few days. But when the government troops advanced to suppress the bandits the previous month, the bandits were unable to resist and prepared to retreat. Before retreating, they planned to subject Yue to the cruel punishment of skinning him alive. The method was to cut a slit in his neck with a knife and rub it with alcohol to peel off the skin while he was still alive and not dead. Yue knew that he could not escape, so he asked to give a speech before he died, and said that he would not make any opposing remarks. So the bandits gathered a meeting, and Yue went on stage and spoke at length about the crimes of the Communists. Before he could finish, he was chopped twice by the bandits. His right hand, because he was wearing a jade bracelet, was also chopped off. The situation was very tragic. The bandits originally planned to throw his body into the water, but someone in the bandits suggested that Yue's relatives would definitely prepare money to redeem the body, so they preserved his body. Later, the bandit suppression army suddenly arrived, and the bandits abandoned Yue's body and fled in a panic. I heard that after Zhang Huizan was killed, his body was thrown into the water. It can be said to be tragic. As for the names of the Communists' killings, they are also extremely diverse. One type is called the "dissatisfaction" crime, and the most people are killed. If the bandit leader sees that a person's expression is slightly unhappy when talking to him, he will be driven to be killed. Hearing this kind of thing is really sad. But internal strife also arises within the Communists from time to time, and they kill each other. Several famous Communists in Henan have also been killed. Female Communists are called "Party Aunts," which is extremely ridiculous. The Communists use them to mobilize the army, making it easier to approach and engage in agitation. I asked if these people were willing to be Communists. It is said that most of them are coerced. The Communists are most severely killing the intellectual class, and leaving behind fools to be used as tools. This matter is of great importance to the future of China. At present, young people think that China has no way out and are trying to use the Communist Party's claims as an experiment, but they do not know that they are going down a wrong path. The Communists also train children in the bandit areas. A certain army captured a member of the Communist Party named Zhou, who was only ten years old. When interrogated, he was threatened with the death penalty, but he was not afraid at all and said, "I am not afraid of death." From this, we can see that the Communists are paying such careful attention to elementary school children. In addition, the recovered bandit areas all have arsenals, hospitals, factories, etc., everything that should be there.</p>

<p>Guangdong Issues 4 Million in New Paper Money</p>
<h3>Preparing to Issue a Second Phase of 10 Million in Aviation Bonds</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. Recently, since Guangdong Province banned the export of silver, the exchange rate has risen sharply, especially the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, which has risen to over 44. Foreign trade is declining, and stores in various industries, with winter approaching and a great need for cash, are in a state of credit crunch. In order to regulate the market, the Provincial Bank plans to issue another 4 million yuan in provincial fractional notes, which was submitted to the Provincial Council yesterday (the 22nd) and approved for record. In addition, the military authorities, in order to expand the air force, previously issued 5 million yuan in patriotic aviation bonds, which were distributed to various parties for promotion and sales. Since the issue, only 800,000 yuan has been sold. A lottery was held once before. However, a mere 800,000 yuan is far from the original issue amount. Therefore, it is planned to issue a second aviation bond to quickly raise large sums to expand the air force fleet. On the 18th of this month, a special meeting was convened by four institutions, including the 1st Army Group Headquarters, the Air Force Headquarters, the Department of Finance, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to discuss the second issuance method and amount. As a result, it was decided to issue another 10 million yuan. The issuance procedures and lottery methods are roughly the same as the previous regulations, but the difference is that the promotion and sales procedures have been changed to quota sales. The amount to be allocated to each county is specified, and they are required to complete the sales and submit the money within a limited time. The issuance time is planned to be divided into three periods, with four months as one period. 3 million yuan is sold in quotas each period, and they are required to complete sales within one year. The first period is from December 15th of this year to April 14th of next year; the second period is from April 15th of next year to August 15th; the third period is from August 15th of next year to December 14th. It is heard that after this quota sales method is decided by a special meeting, it will be submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Conference for approval and implementation. (November 23rd)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Consolidates Defense of Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Order to Loyal Citizens to Relocate to Suppress Local Communists in Southern Xiongzhou</p>
<p>Bandit Traces Discovered in Western Jiangxi, Coordinate with Hunan Army to Suppress</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. Recently, the Communists in southern and western Jiangxi are plotting to become active again. After the return of the commander of the 1st Army, Yu Hanmou, to defend, the Guangdong Army actively deployed defenses. The Ganzhou Xingying issued a notice a few days ago, advising the people in the area of southern Jiangxi to store food in advance, and dividing the residents into A, B, C, and D household registration. A and B households should purchase three months of food, C households one and a half months of food, and D households one month of food, and ordered all households to complete the storage between a certain time. For the sake of supervision, the military headquarters implemented the dispatch of personnel for inspection and sealing. Recently, the Independent 3rd Division dispatched the 3rd Regiment to search and suppress local Communists in the Youshan and Zhangling areas within Southern Xiongzhou. But many of the loyal citizens were still living there. When the bandit was being suppressed, there was a fear of a difficult separation of good and bad. The regimental headquarters then convened a local meeting to implement the relocation of loyal citizens in order to suppress bandits. The Youshan Zhangling area's villages, such as the twenty-six villages in the Zhenping township, the forty-seven villages in the Datang township, the eleven villages in the Qiaodu township, the seven materials of the Daojing township, the fourteen villages of the Pingitan township, all of them should be relocated to another area before November 22, and all food should be moved as well in order to prevent aiding the bandits. As for Ganzhou, according to recent news, there are about 2,000 more Communists in Xingguo, and bandits are also gathered in Ban Jing and Xingren, seemingly moving to Wan'an, attempting to assist the Communists in western Jiangxi. Commander Yu Hanmou, according to reports, is in contact with Chen Cheng's division of the Central Army in Wan'an to maintain vigilance, and ordered the regiments of Ye Zhao's division of his department to tighten the defense of Ganzhou, build blockhouses, and install electric nets. And sent the 6th regiment of Ye's division to Jin Tang and other places to tighten the defenses. On the first division's side, Deputy Division Commander Mo Xide is directing his troops to set up defenses in the Tanbang area at Shangyu, and working with the Hunan Army to search and suppress Kong Hechong's faction of the pseudo 7th division of Communists in western Jiangxi. The Hunan militia had previously repelled the Kong bandits who invaded Baitutan in Liling, eastern Hunan. The remaining bandits have scattered and fled to the remote areas of western Jiangxi. Therefore, in order to prevent bandit troubles, the Guangdong Army has ordered the 3rd air squadron stationed in Shaozhou to send aircraft to reconnaissance in the western Jiangxi area for days. But on the 15th, they discovered red flags in the mountains and valleys, and the Communists were moving westward in single file, seemingly heading towards eastern Hunan. They immediately flew back to report. Commander Yu immediately telegraphed Wang Dongyuan's division of the Hunan Army in eastern Hunan to quickly send troops to Yingqian and arrange to cooperate in the suppression, so that nothing is missed.

<h3>Reasons for Economic Decline in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Social Unrest Due to Soldiers and Bandits</p>
<p>Rural Bankruptcy After the Flood</p>
<p>Commercial Recession and Financial Stagnation</p>
<p>Report from Bengbu: Amidst the national economic decline and business depression, northern Anhui has suffered economic ruin, hardship for the people, and growing social unrest due to years of communist banditry and last year's floods. This is unprecedented in decades. The reasons are complex, and the significant points are analyzed as follows: ① Military Impact: In terms of transportation, northern Anhui has convenient land routes through the Jinpu Railway and waterways via the Huai, Fei, and Ying Rivers. Geographically, it controls Jiangsu and Shandong to the north and connects Henan and Hubei to the west. Any conflict makes it a battleground for military strategists. Over the years, northern Anhui has invariably been affected by wars. Undisciplined troops, wherever they go, arbitrarily requisition supplies and exploit the people relentlessly, severely damaging the people's vitality and repeatedly hindering the social economy. ② Banditry Impact: The people of northern Anhui are inherently tough. In recent years, due to frequent wars, the docile have been subjected to oppression, while the cunning have taken risks. Unscrupulous individuals have seized the opportunity to rise up, and with the Communist Party taking the opportunity to incite, the power of bandits and communists has grown rampant day by day, committing arson, murder, rape, and pillage, leaving no evil undone. The people in bandit-controlled areas have suffered immensely, with fields lying barren, homes in ruins, and economic hardship beyond description. ③ Natural Disaster Impact: Northern Anhui is located in the Huai River basin, where most residents are farmers, producing a variety of grains. Last year, unfortunately, a major flood occurred, turning twenty-one counties into a watery expanse, exacerbated by hailstorms, which devastated agricultural products. The rural economy was completely bankrupt, leading to a lack of purchasing power, farmers crying out in distress, and a daily increase in unemployment. ④ Impact of Taxes: Northern Anhui is relatively far from the provincial capital, and some remote counties are almost isolated. Feudal forces are extremely powerful, making it difficult for the provincial government to intervene effectively. As a result, corrupt officials collude with local tyrants and evil gentry to engage in harmful activities, leading to a proliferation of various exorbitant taxes. The collection of boat taxes along the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River is particularly onerous. Recently, a grain permit fee has also been levied. The government's exploitation leaves the people with no means to complain. Farmers, burdened with heavy taxes, have no choice but to sell their harvested grain at distress prices, resulting in a situation where cheap grain hurts the farmers. ⑤ Impact of Money: Northern Anhui has suffered from natural disasters and human-caused calamities for years, causing the nascent industry and commerce to plummet. After the depression, it has continued to decline. With the people lacking purchasing power, there is a significant shortage of cash. Major banks in Bengbu, due to the difficulty in recovering loans, have stopped lending, leading to tight credit, financial stagnation, and increasingly difficult cash flow. Shop closures are frequently reported. (25th day)</p>

<p>The County Government Convenes a Winter Defense Meeting: The County Government believes that in the current winter defense period, local security should be planned for in advance. Therefore, yesterday (27th), it convened the 21st Annual Winter Defense Meeting. Attendees included officers from the land and water police forces, the head of the security bureau, and leaders from various districts. County Magistrate Shen Yong chaired the meeting, and the following matters were discussed: ① Adoption of the Winter Defense Outline; ① Whether there is a need to redeploy land and water police forces during the winter defense period should be comprehensively planned by the land and water police forces and reported to the county for record; ① During the winter defense period, the passwords for the police whistles and military garrison areas may use the passwords issued by the Security Office; ① The Director of the Public Security Bureau should request the addition of winter defense police during the winter defense period to strengthen forces, and it was decided to add personnel as in previous winter defense cases, with each district adding as appropriate; ① The First District Leader proposed that during the winter defense period, for the sake of communication, the Construction Bureau should be ordered to actively install telephones to facilitate defense, and it was resolved that the County Magistrate and the Construction Bureau would jointly work with the First District Office to actively install telephones in the near future.</p>
<p>Bank Robbery Suspects to Be Brought Back for Trial: The case of the robbery of the Songjiang branch of the Xingye Bank, in which bandits were involved, had been without leads for a long time. Recently, Lu Ying, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, discovered the trail of the bandits in the case and led detectives, with official documents, to the relevant police station to arrest Niu Jinpu and six others. According to the confessions of Niu Jinpu and others, the case was reported to the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review. The suspects arrested were Niu Jinpu, Zheng Shaobo, Li Yinghan, Sun Hanquan, Niu Langshi, and Shao, all from Hefei County, Anhui Province. Niu had previously served in the military and is highly suspected of being involved in the Xingye Bank case. The government has dispatched personnel to Shanghai to escort them back to the county for interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>Several Hundred Disaster Victims Go to the County to Petition: The local Relief Association distributed relief funds to various districts on the 21st, having previously sent letters to the County Government and various township chiefs, instructing them to investigate and report on the households affected by the disaster in detail for verification and distribution. However, most of the township chiefs failed to handle the matter impartially, so most of the disaster victims did not receive relief, while those who were not affected by the disaster received one or several relief tickets. This aroused resentment. Yesterday afternoon, more than 500 disaster victims gathered and went to the County Government to petition, demanding relief and requesting punishment for the township chiefs who were acting in a corrupt and biased manner. Qian, the Section Chief of the First Section, and Wu Chengzhe, an official, came out to meet them and promised to investigate and handle the matter. The disaster victims were satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<p>The Boat Accident Case is Brought to Public Prosecution: Regarding the tragic case of the overturning of a steamship at the Ancient Relics Museum of Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi, which resulted in the drowning deaths of Zhu Liangren, Zhu Tianle, and Fu Yuwen, has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the steamship driver, Fei A'da, and the mechanic, Zhu A'you, were apprehended by the Third District of the Water Police and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. After repeated interrogations by Prosecutor Qian, the case has been concluded. Yesterday, they were indicted for causing death due to negligence in their duties. The families of the deceased have been provided with condolence money through the initiation of Zhang Taiyan, Li Genyuan, and others.</p>
<p>Wuxian Business Community Changes to Using Standard Measures: The County Chamber of Commerce has been ordered to promote the new system of weights and measures and is actively carrying out the task. Yesterday (26th), the committee decided that implementing both weights and measures simultaneously would be quite difficult. It was decided to start with measuring instruments first, and Shi Junqing, Shen Shuzhang, Zhu Jingbo, Yan Chuqing, and Fan Junzhuan were appointed to handle the matter. It is expected that by the first day of the lunar new year, the entire county will be using the new system.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Suzhou-Jiaxing Long-Distance Bus Route: The Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway, which runs from Suzhou through Wujiang to Jiaxing, has been under construction for several months since its groundbreaking.

It is reported that some people have initiated the organization of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Long-Distance Bus Company, with an authorized capital of 100,000 yuan, divided into 1,000 shares, each share worth 100 yuan. Fundraising is currently underway, and registration is in progress.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Cause Trouble at the Train Station: Every time trains arrive or depart from Suzhou Railway Station, rickshaws and cars solicit passengers, causing disorderly conditions. Cui Shaobo, the new section chief of the Third Division of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police Department, took office a week ago and immediately planned to rectify the situation. He ordered the police to confine rickshaw pullers within the boundaries of the train platform and instructed coachmen to sit on their carriages and not to get off to solicit customers. For rickshaws without licenses, a small photo identification card must be donated to the station. Those who violate the rules and solicit passengers will be severely punished. As a result, yesterday (26th) at 11:00 AM, when the Shanghai express train arrived, rickshaws and carriages responded in unison, leaving the train station and going on strike, refusing to pull passengers. They also blocked vehicles from other stations from entering the station at key intersections. Female passengers and those carrying luggage were in a particularly difficult situation. The turmoil remained unresolved by evening.</p>

<p>Murderer in Fushan Case Imprisoned: Wei Fulin, a farmer from Beibaoli, Fushan District, was discovered by Su Baosheng and others while committing theft at Su's house. Su, together with Ni Tiantian and Luo Xing, chased Wei to Haicheng and beat him to death. The next morning, the town chief, together with the Public Security Bureau, detained Su Baosheng and four others and sent them to the county. According to the confessions of Su Baosheng, Luo Kangsheng, Luo Jinhai, and Xu Er, Wei was beaten by Ni Tiantian and Luo Xing, who were on the run, and they were only chasing behind them and did not lay a hand on him. As a result, the official ordered the imprisonment of Su and four others until Ni and Luo, who were on the run, are arrested, and the case will be handled accordingly. The body of Wei Fulin was taken back by his family for burial.</p>
<p>Dispute over Sand Fields in Shazhou: Disputes over sand fields have occurred in Shazhou City for many years, and there has been no peace. This summer, Huang Zhulou, from Shazhou Hunghu, kidnapped Lu Lianshi, the custodian of the district office, in order to seize the sand fields. Fortunately, the military and police worked hard to capture him and rescue Lu Lianshi from danger. Huang Zhulou was arrested and imprisoned, and the case has not yet been closed. Unexpectedly, yesterday (25th), Cao Yinnian, the chairman of the Sand Field Custody Committee, was supervising workers who were repairing the embankment when suddenly Sha Zaitang, a member of Huang Zhulou's gang, led a crowd of more than 200 people to seize the field. The two sides started arguing, and as a result, Sha Zaitang ordered the abduction of four laborers: Li Wanglang and Zhang Zhichang. Cao was lucky to escape and immediately reported to the district office and the Public Security Bureau, requesting the police to rescue them and urgently telegramming the County Government to inform all subordinates to find a way to rescue them. Cao Yinnian also formally filed a lawsuit with the County Government. As of the evening of the 26th, the whereabouts of the four abducted people were still unknown.</p>

The child initially cried, but when the midwife held it in her hands, she saw the child's head gradually shortening. In a moment, the child's entire head was inside its body, like a turtle retracting its head into its shell. It looked like a headless child. After about half an hour, the child's head still did not extend out, and it died due to suffocation. The whole village was shocked and rushed to see the strange news. It is recorded here for the study of physiologists.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>A Military Officer Commits Suicide in Zhenjiang: Wan Chao, courtesy name Jiaoquan, a native of Shouxian County, Anhui Province, was 42 years old. He had previously studied in England and participated in the European War. After returning to China, he graduated from the First Infantry Class of the Huangpu Military Academy's Chaozhou Branch. He served as a platoon leader, company commander, and battalion commander in the Second Division of the Army and as the commander of the Fifth Battalion of the Central Military Academy's Transport Corps. In January of this year, the Independent Brigade of the Second Division was downsized, and Wan lost his job. This autumn, he came to Zhenjiang to seek a position from Chairman Gu, waiting for three months without success. After being stranded for a long time, he ran out of money. While in Zhenjiang, he had a romantic relationship with a woman, but recently he suddenly lost her. Overwhelmed by poverty and illness, he conceived the idea of suicide. On the night of the 25th of this month, he secretly went to the side of the lecture hall in Baoxian Park and hanged himself from a locust tree. On the morning of the 26th, someone discovered him and immediately reported it to the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. The chief of the bureau found three suicide notes, one to Chairman Gu, one to Director Zhou, and one to a friend, along with more than a dozen letters of appointment, party certificates, and membership cards from the Huangpu Military Academy. Director Zhou, in addition to reporting the verification, also followed Chairman Gu's order to advance 100 yuan for the coffin. Here is his letter to Chairman Gu: Honored Three Seats, Jianjun: I, Wan Chao, after graduating from the military school, participated in the Northern Expedition from Guangdong, following you, sir, and have been treated with care. However, I am ashamed of having made no contribution and have lost my job. In these nine months, I have deeply felt the difficulties of life and the monotony of life. Added to this is the memory of the past, the various ways in which I have failed people and myself over the past thirty years. Overwhelmed with pain and anger, I have no choice but to end it all with suicide. There are unspeakable secrets that I cannot tell directly. I hope you will remember our old friendship and my current plight and resolve all matters related to my aftermath. I will be eternally grateful in the afterlife.</p>

<h3>Completion of Dike Project by the National Government Flood Relief Committee</h3>
<p>All engineers are Chinese, none are Westerners; a grand ceremony was held in Nanjing today. The inspection committee set off by ship the day before yesterday, starting from Zhenjiang, scheduled to complete in one month.</p>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the National Government Flood Relief Committee, in addition to distributing emergency relief and agricultural assistance, also planned large-scale work relief projects. The seven provinces most severely affected by the disaster were divided into eighteen districts. Work began last winter. Now, except for one or two places where completion was impossible due to special circumstances and which were transferred to the National Economic Council for continued handling, all the others have been completed one after another. The main dikes of the rivers Jiang, Huai, Gan, Han, Yi, Luo, Li, and Yun have all been repaired and completed. Now the National Government Flood Relief Committee is about to conclude all its work within the year, having spent a total of about 60 million yuan on emergency relief, agricultural assistance, and work relief. The work relief aspect accounts for over 20 million yuan. The project was vast, so a Dike Project Inspection Group was specially organized, inviting ministers from various ministries and leaders from Chinese and Western communities in Shanghai to participate. A completion ceremony was held in Nanjing on the 18th. The inspection group left Shanghai on the morning of the 16th at 10 o'clock aboard the China Merchants Bureau's special Jiangxin steamer. The planned inspection route starts from Zhenjiang, goes west along the Yangtze River through Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Pengze, Jiujiang to Hankou, then turns from Han to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Bengbu, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Funing, Dongtai, and then returns to Shanghai. The inspection period is scheduled for one month. As for the inspection group for bandit areas in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, invited by Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, there is no confirmed organization in Shanghai yet. One or two representatives from other groups also joined the ship to Hankou. It is expected that after another thorough discussion in Nanjing, they will arrive in Hankou to meet Chairman Chiang for instructions, and then formulate detailed inspection methods. In fact, the inspection group and the inspection group are one and two, and those who are. A reporter from this newspaper is also one of the participants. The details of leaving Shanghai and arriving in Zhenjiang are recorded below. The findings of inspections along the way will be published in succession.</p>
<p>The Situation of Leaving Shanghai</p>
<p>The organization of the Dike Project Inspection Group was prepared by Committee Member Li Zujin at the request of Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Flood Relief Committee. Representatives from all walks of life participated enthusiastically, but temporarily, due to important official duties, many changed to taking the evening train to Nanjing on the 17th to attend the completion ceremony, such as Yu Youren, Wang Xiaolai, Li Zujin, and Liu Yunfang. Some withdrew directly due to their own affairs, such as Liu Zhanen and Wang Yansong, so there were many changes in the representatives. The Jiangxin steamer was specially chartered by the Flood Relief Committee, and the reception matters were handled jointly by staff members of the Flood Relief Committee, Shi Shiliang and Shi Bangrui. The ship left Shanghai at 10:45 a.m. on the 26th. Li Zujin and other staff members of the Flood Relief Committee went to the Jinliyuan Wharf to see them off.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The representatives from all walks of life who set off from Shanghai that day included Song Zi'an representing Song Ziwen, Lin Kanghou representing the Bankers' Association, Wen Lanting representing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Rulin representing the Money Dealers' Association, Luo [Blank] Hui representing Mayor Wu, Wu Shan representing the Roads Association, and Mr. and Mrs. Hu Junzhuang, Mr. and Mrs. Hu Xuanming, Mr. and Mrs. Fei Wusheng, Wu Liande, and reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, including Qian Hua from Shen Bao, Lu Yi from Xinwen Bao, Zhu Yunguang from Shishi Xinbao, Fei Enqu from Zi Lin Xi Bao, and reporters from Chinese and Western news agencies. On the National Government Flood Relief Committee side, there were Chairman Simpson, Committee Member Zhang Shouyong, Work Relief Office Director Xi Dejiong, General Affairs Office Zhou Qibang, and over sixty engineers and other staff members.</p>
<p>Inspection Schedule</p>
<p>The inspection schedule is divided into two major parts. From November 26th to December 8th, it is the first part, inspecting the main dike project of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Jianghan. From December 21st to October 24th, it is the first part, inspecting the Yi, Luo, Huai, and Yun projects in southern Henan, northern Anhui, and Lixiahe.

It is heard that representatives from all walks of life are scheduled to return after arriving in Hankou.</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong's Speech</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of the Work Relief Office, said to reporters on the ship: "I, Dejiong, was ordered to handle the work relief, but I am very afraid because of my mediocre talent. According to the great flood last year, the population affected by the disaster in the southeastern provinces was more than 50 million, and the area affected by the disaster reached 400,000 square li. After eight or nine months of hard work, more than one million disaster workers were recruited, and thousands of engineers and technical staff were hired. Only then was the work relief in various districts completely completed. It is found that the matter of work relief is to use work to replace relief. The disaster workers can get relief through work, and the country can revitalize industry. The relationship is extremely complex. Although the name of work relief often appears in historical records, the methods are not detailed, and it is not known exactly. Therefore, there were no successful methods to refer to when handling this work relief, and the time was also very short. The difficulties can be imagined. Later, fortunately, with the support of all parties, there was some success, which was really a fluke. However, how is the work area, after all, the actual work site, and what is the truth? The outside world still has some misunderstandings. Therefore, on the occasion of the completion of the great work, I respectfully invite people from all walks of life, Chinese and foreign, to conduct on-site inspections in various districts for guidance. Gentlemen of the press, you have always been in the position of teachers of the people. I have long planned to invite you to gather and report all the handling situation, but because of the busy affairs, I have not been able to do so. At this Chinese and foreign dike project inspection meeting, I specially sincerely invite you to go together. My intention is very serious. After you have conducted on-site inspections of how vast the disaster area was last year, how tragic the disaster situation was, and how difficult the work relief was, you can fully understand it. You can use what you have learned to offer it to the world, so that people in the world can understand the situation of the work relief handled this year, and its benefits to the national economy and people's livelihood are extremely important. Moreover, Dejiong has greater hopes for you. You must know why China has floods every year, and why the disaster last year was so serious. Although it can be said to be God's will, it is not necessarily caused by the failure of people to repair things on weekdays. Just look at how many rivers and channels pay attention to rectification? Once something happens, they are at a loss. This can be taken as a warning. This year, the country has spent tens of millions of huge sums of money, borrowed American wheat, and built dikes of 7,000 or 8,000 kilometers, and dredged hundreds of kilometers of rivers and channels. From now on, the people and governments of all provinces must take care of them and repair them from time to time so that they can last. Otherwise, after a few years, they will be destroyed again. I hope you will explain this idea to the local people in a kind and sincere way, so as to avoid the recurrence of floods. The inspection time is only set for more than 30 days. With more than 10,000 li of long dikes, of course, only the important sections can be seen, and it is impossible to see them all in detail. However, for this inspection, the National Government Flood Relief Association, although the time is short, the meaning is extremely long. Now we are sailing upstream along the river. Wherever we go, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and Xin Dike and Jianli, we will inspect the Yangtze River dikes. After returning [Blank], we will go to Xiantao Town and Yuekou area to inspect the Han River project. We will also go from Hankou to Zhengzhou to inspect the Yi, Luo, and Sha Ying rivers, stone and earthworks. Then we will go from Zhengzhou to Bengbu to inspect the work relief in the three districts of Anhui and Huai. Finally, we will go to the northern part of Jiangsu to inspect the canal and Lixiahe dike drainage projects. The long journey is arduous. I sincerely hope that you will not spare your efforts and carry things through to the end. I am very fortunate. This [Blank] work, the time is short and hurried, and the reception is not good. Please forgive me. If you have any questions, please contact engineers Zhang Chongji and Xue Zhaoshu of our office at any time. I will sincerely tell you everything, and I still hope to be taught from time to time."</p>
<p>Evening Gathering</p>
<p>At 8:30 p.m. on the 26th, the entire inspection group gathered in the dining room of the Jiangxin steamer. Chairman Simpson of [Blank] presided over the meeting. Simpson gave a speech on the significance of this trip and the work of the Flood Relief Association and its relationship with politics and economy. Next, Committee Member Zhang [Blank] Yong gave a speech, followed by Xi Dejiong reporting the inspection schedule. Finally, a [Blank] wierd sound film "Zombie" was shown. The spirit, which had been exhausted all day, was refreshed, and everyone went to bed at 11:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Simpson's Speech</p>
<p>Vice Chairman Simpson said at the time, "It is a great honor for you to come. I have several thoughts on the work of the Flood Relief Association. First, the economic impact. Millions of disaster victims in the disaster area have been given a new lease of life because of the relief work of the Flood Relief Association, and the construction of dikes has made it possible for the rural economy to recover as soon as possible. This year's good harvest should be attributed to this. In terms of China's entire national economy, the disaster area [Blank] and the disaster victims are greatly affected. First, the political impact. Most of the disaster areas are based in the Communist Party. If the government does not provide relief, millions of disaster victims will invest in the Communist Party, which will be endless. Moreover, because the Central Government directly sets up associations to distribute relief, it makes the villagers think about the kindness of the National Government, and indirectly disperses the efforts of the Communist Party, until they are exhausted and powerless. Third, we should pay special attention to the fact that the entire dike construction project of the Work Relief Office of the Association is completely undertaken by Chinese engineers, and no Westerners participate in it, breaking the usual practice, which is very commendable. Fourth, recently [Blank] all parties have quite a few unsatisfactory criticisms of this association. It should be known that no matter what [Blank] things, it is impossible to be completely satisfactory. We hope [Blank] you will give strict criticism after inspecting the various projects, and hope to conclude after the inspection [Blank], that is, the Flood Relief Association [Blank] more than 60 million yuan, in terms of today's achievements, is it worth it?"</p>
<p>Zhang Shouyong's Speech</p>
<p>Then Zhang Shouyong, a member of the Flood Relief Association, gave a speech, saying that since the unprecedented flood occurred last year, the central authorities, because the disaster was too great, held meetings all day long and had no solution. At that time, I and Mr. Rong Zongjing met with Finance Minister Song, and took the American wheat loan as a key point of discussion. After consideration, because the disaster was too widespread, we had to seek help from countries around the world. To make up for the deficiency with their surplus is not contradictory in terms of [Blank] and reason. Therefore, we proceeded resolutely until it was successful. Domestic circles and overseas Chinese successively donated more than 8 million yuan. The Flood Relief Association has today's achievements, all thanks to the gifts of countries around the world and various circles. This should be specially thanked to you, especially the foreign guests present. Now that the dike has been completed, we especially hope that we will work hard to request good follow-up methods for the dike, that is, how to make the dike permanent and not damaged. In my opinion, the most important thing is to ask the central government to enact a dike protection law, and at the same time, the Ministry of Finance should [Blank] set up a dike tax to be used for repairs at any time, so that it can be done once and for all. (Qian Hua sent from Zhenjiang on the 17th)</p>
<p>Inspection of the First District</p>
<p>The Jiangxin steamer arrived in Zhenjiang at around 4:00 a.m. on the 27th [Blank]. Because the wharf was not repaired [Blank], it was anchored in the heart of the river. At 8:00 a.m., Han Deqin, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Li [Blank] Yang, the head of the Security Department, took the Jiangli ferry to the ship to [Blank] greet them. At the same time, Li [Blank], a staff member of the Lizi [Blank], also rushed from Nanjing to take care of things. Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, sent [Blank] greetings and said that after arriving in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th, all [Blank] would visit the mausoleum and tour the entire city for a week. In the afternoon, Song [Blank] hosted a banquet at Lizi Society. At 3:00 p.m., a completion ceremony for the dike project will be held in the Jiangxin steamer's cabin, and ministers from various ministries and consuls from various countries will be invited to participate. At 8:30 a.m., the whole party transferred to the Jiangli ferry to the opposite bank to inspect the dike project of the first district. Xue Zhaoshu, the head of the first district project, led the [Blank]. The ferry [Blank] arrived at the river bank [Blank] and changed to a public bus. After traveling about one mile to Hongqiao Town, they got off the bus and walked half a mile to Dazaoganzhou Dike, which is the starting point of the Flood Relief Association's dike project. Most of the old dike of Dazaoganzhou [Blank] had collapsed. Now a new dike has been built. Looking at the old dike from a distance, it is like the first line of defense, and the new dike is the second line of defense. It is about four-tenths of a foot high, one meter higher than the flood level last year, and about six-tenths of a mile long. Vegetables have been planted on both sides of the dike, with green and yellow alternating, endless at a glance. According to the staff of the Engineering Office, this dike is the simplest of all, and the most people working on it reached 7,000 or 8,000, and at least 1,000. The dike soil was all dug from the people's fields next to it, to a depth of 4 meters, and now it is full of stream water, looking like a fishing pond. Then they went to Guadong Dike for inspection. Along the way, the responsible [Blank] project specialists gave detailed explanations. Guadong Dike is [Blank] lower than Dazaoganzhou Dike. There are only more than 20 earthen houses built on the dike as temporary homes for disaster victims. They are very busy at work, and men and women help each other, which is very harmonious. According to the villagers, in last year's flood, the water reached [Blank], and all the property was swept away by the flood, but fortunately, no lives were sacrificed, which is gratifying. This year's harvest is good, but the price of grain has fallen, which is not profitable. At 11:00 a.m., the whole party took the Jiangli ferry back to the Jiangxin steamer for a short rest, and then had lunch to respond to the joy of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Banquet</p>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Director of Education Department Zhou Fohai, Director of Construction Department [Blank] Xiu Jia, Director of Finance Department Shu Shifu, Director of Civil Affairs Department Zhao Qi [Blank], Director of Security Department Li [Blank] Yang, Provincial Committee Han Dedong, He Yushu, Jin Tigan, and Wang Boling, hosted a banquet for the entire inspection group at Baoxian Park in Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 27th. A welcome arch was built on the riverside, and the police and military band were specially dispatched to play music to welcome them along the way. During the banquet, the Chairman delivered a welcome speech, and Vice Chairman Simpson of the Flood Relief Association delivered a reply. At about 2:00 p.m., the guests and hosts dispersed happily. After the banquet, everyone went to Jiaoshan for sightseeing and returned to the ship tired at 5:00 p.m. (Qian Hua sent from Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 27th)</p>
<p>Prior Planning</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She, along with Section Chief [Blank] Mingjiu, and engineers Xue Zhaoshu and Lu Chao, had detailed discussions on the ship about the work relief process, and received detailed answers, which are recorded as follows: The design of water conservancy projects cannot be done without a long-term overall plan, but our country's restoration after fatigue is especially difficult. From the national level to the provincial and county levels, although water conservancy organizations are everywhere, there are many huge plans, but the implementation is few. The Work Relief Office of the Flood Relief Association, in order to relieve disaster victims, could not wait. The plan should be practical. As soon as the water receded, construction should begin immediately. The outline of the design is described as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Standards: In the flood area last year, from Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the south, to the main streams of the Jianghuai, Hanyun, and Feihe rivers in the central part, and the banks of the rivers and dams of the Tuo, Hao, Yi, and Luo rivers in the north, up to thousands of miles, it is impossible to repair them all due to lack of financial resources. Therefore, six construction standards were formulated based on economic conditions and relief needs: 1. The scope of work relief is limited to earthworks, and the types of projects are mainly the repair of main dikes and supplemented by river dredging to discharge water. 2. Dike repair should focus on the parts of the main rivers that were flooded and breached in the current flood. 3. The restoration should be to the original state or able to resist floods like the current flood. 4. The dilapidated or waterway-obstructing parts of the old dike may be slightly modified, such as raising, thickening, moving the bay, and straightening. 5. For the dilapidated old dikes where the earthwork does not exceed the repair, new dikes may be built as appropriate. 6. For the purpose of draining accumulated water, the original river channels may be opened up or connected. For the Yangtze River embankments, they should be repaired from Zhenjiang and above based on the flood situation last year.</p>
<p>Surveying Process: After the establishment of the Flood Relief Association, it chartered an airplane and, in August last year, requested the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Yangzhoujiang Remediation Committee to send personnel to take the plane to survey the disaster areas of the Yangtze River and the Dongting and Poyang lakes. The flood area of the Grand Canal was surveyed by General Zhu Lianlan, director of the disaster area working group, and Zhou Xiangxian and others by plane. In late October, when the water receded slightly, the Yangzhoujiang Waterway Remediation Committee, the Huai River Guidance Committee, the Construction Departments of Hunan and Jiangsu provinces, and the Water Conservancy Bureaus of Hubei and Jiangxi provinces were convened to survey the Jianghan Huaiyun, Xiangchen Lake, and Gan various water dikes separately, so that there was a basis for project estimates and construction plans.</p>
<p>Dike Standards: Dike projects are divided into repair and new construction. According to the regulations of the Technical Committee of the Flood Relief Association, the height should be one-tenth of a foot higher than the flood level, the dike surface should be 3 meters to 4 meters wide, and the slope on both sides should be 1:3 for the outer slope. The dike is ten feet high and the slope is 20 feet long, and the inner slope is 1:5, which is a great improvement compared to the old dike, which only had a slope of 1:1. It also formulated 20 dike construction guidelines, including dike [Blank] soil research (compact new soil with stone hammer), acceptance supervision, (such as preventing the disadvantages of wearing hats and boots, that is, only adding the top of the dike and the [Blank] of the dike, etc.,) and other items, all have detailed regulations, and six dike construction drawings, detailing the soil excavation grid to avoid digging into the river, and the construction of roads across the dike, and the first slope along the river bank should follow the river and go down, and should not be parallel against the flow, or form right angles, etc.</p>
<p>River Dredging Plan: The Lixiahe area in Jiangsu (Yancheng, Yuhua, and Donghao counties) is shaped like the bottom of a pot. Whenever there is a big flood, the Jiang and Huai rivers cannot accommodate it and converge here. The original five ports are winding and silted up. Therefore, the five ports of [Blank] Xiahe, as well as the Yuanhe and Shahe rivers in eastern Henan, and the Beifei rivers between Huai and Si, should be dredged, the silt should be dredged, the bends should be straightened, and the blockages should be cleared to discharge the accumulated water. The slope of the river bank varies from place to place, but is generally 1:2.5, and there are also 1:3 and 1:1.</p>
<p>Construction Process</p>
<p>The Engineering Office [Blank] belongs to the Disaster Area Working Group, with Xi Mingjiu as the director, divided into two sections, engineering and technology, and eighteen work relief bureaus outside. It was originally scheduled to end in June this year, but because several projects were not completed, it was extended to September. A small number of unfinished projects were transferred to the Jinguo Economic Committee for handling.</p>
<p>Setting up bureaus by district is for the convenience of implementation and management. According to the size of the river system and the severity of the disaster, it is divided into eighteen districts in total, including seven districts in the Yangtze River, three districts in the Huai River, two districts in the Han River, three districts in the Lixiahe, one district in each of the Xiangyuan, Yi Luo, and Su Yun rivers. Except for the [Blank] Xiahe [Blank] fifteen districts, due to changes in the plan, only three sections were handled, divided into the sixteenth and seventh districts, and the tenth district of Xiangyuan was entrusted to the Hunan Flood Relief Rehabilitation Association to handle it on its behalf. The remaining sixteen districts all established engineering bureaus, each with an engineer as the director and deputy engineer, technicians, clerks, etc. Below the district, depending on the size of the project, it is divided into several sections, each with a deputy engineer as the section chief and technicians and clerks. Below the section is divided into ten regiments, each with an overseer and a deputy overseer, and the labor regiment is divided into twenty rows, each with twenty-five disaster workers, selecting the most capable as the row head.</p>
<p>Wheat Wages: The Flood Relief Association lent 450,000 tons of wheat from the United States, of which 30 million tons were used for work relief. The number of allocations in each district was determined by the Technical Committee after surveying and estimating the closure of each district. General wheat stations were set up in Pukou, Wuhu, Anqing, Hankou, and Jiujiang, and one, two, or three class stations were set up at his discretion. The transportation team was responsible for transporting, storing, and distributing affairs officers. Disaster victims are paid wages according to the amount of earthwork they do. The payment standards are: 1. Flat land soil extraction is 25 cents to 40 cents per square meter. 2. If the soil extraction is more than 50 meters away, add 5 cents per square for every 20 meters. For deep soil extraction and high soil dropping, add 3 cents per square for every meter high or deep. 3. For ramming work, one corner per square. Every week, the technicians and supervisors check and accept the earthwork once and fill out a wheat voucher, which the head of the row takes to the grain station to collect.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Repairing Dikes: The Flood Relief Association's use of work for relief to repair dikes accounts for [Blank] half of the entire project. Therefore, except for the sixteenth and seventeenth districts, which are river dredging, and the tenth and twenty-eighth districts, most of which are river dredging, the rest are dike construction. The Dongting Lake system in the [Blank] district is handled by the Lake and Water Disaster Committee on its behalf, completing 9,426,050 cubic meters of earthwork, issuing 20,000,000 tons of wheat, and repairing [Blank] dikes with a length of about 3,000 kilometers. The rest is mainly handled by the Work Relief Office of the Association, with a dike length of 4,398 kilometers, completing more than 18,100,000 cubic meters of earthwork, actually issuing more than 196,800 tons of wheat and grain, and spending more than 1,460,000 yuan on subsequent expenses. On average, 47 tons of wheat were issued for the construction of one kilometer of dike, and the cost was 330 yuan. The number of disaster workers was at least 300,000 and at most 900,000.</p>
<p>Dredging Water: The districts in eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and Lixiahe in northern Jiangsu have dredged 287 kilometers of river channels and straightened them, completing 3,540,000 cubic meters of earthwork, actually issuing 23,700 tons of wheat and grain, and spending more than 181,900 yuan on administrative expenses. On average, 83 tons of wheat were issued per kilometer and the cost was 634 yuan, because the river dredging is more difficult than the [Blank] embankment project. The scope of the Flood Relief Association's work relief is limited to earthwork. All other stone, earth, and concrete work is handled by local governments. However, after the floods in each province, financial resources were exhausted and fundraising was very reported. The flood defenses built by the bureaus in Henan and Anhui actually needed to add culverts and add stone work. Therefore, 24 culverts were built in the [Blank] wheat ration and 4 rivers and Ying rivers were added with stone and earthworks.</p>
<h3>Additional Road and Telegraph Relief Donations</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying and others have telegraphed the Yuan and Ministry separately</p>
<p>Please implement it on the 16th of next month</p>
<p>The Provisional Righteous Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei yesterday requested the implementation of the road and telegraph additional donation matter and telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Railways and Communications separately, saying: "Song Dai, President of the Executive Yuan, Jianjian, Railway Department, [Blank] Bu Zi, and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, Xunjian. On the matter of raising funds for the recovery and disaster relief in the disaster areas of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, the association previously proposed and requested to hold a road and telegraph additional donation. Chairman Chiang replied by telegram, 'I have already telegraphed to Junyuan (the Executive Yuan) on the same day, ordering certain departments (most departments) to follow up.' Later, the association elected Standing Committee members Xu Shiying, [Blank] Wu Tiecheng, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Qicai, and Zheng Hongnian to contact the Yuan and Ministry and earnestly requested that it be held as soon as possible, so that the disaster victims would benefit. Shiying is scheduled to take the night train on the 27th of this month [Blank] to Beijing to request instructions in person. I beg you to quickly grant (an order to certain departments) to hold it separately from December 16th. Regarding the railway additional relief funds, it is proposed that the Ministry of Railways order the railway bureaus to send them to the Central China Transportation Bank in each place at the end of each month. For the telegraph additional item, it is proposed that the Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications collect it on its behalf and remit it together before the 5th of the following month, and allocate it to the competent authority for instructions and handling. As it is a matter of disaster relief and funds are urgently needed, I respectfully telegram, I implore you to examine it, and the Shanghai Relief Rehabilitation Temporary Righteous Relief Association for Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, Xu Shiying, Wang Zhen, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Tiecheng, Ye Gongchuo, Wen Lanting, Chen Qicai, Zhang Xuan, Du Rong, Zheng Hongnian, Huang Qinglan, Li Jin, Qu Yingguang, Zhao Xien, Wu Zhihao, Guo Xu, Kouchou."</p>
<h3>The Guizhou Uprising Comes to an End</h3>
<p>You Guocai Occupies Guiyang</p>
<p>Welcoming Mao Guangxiang Back to the Province</p>
<p>Wang Jialie Flees to Longli Alone</p>
<p>Mao Guangxiang telegraphed from Zunyi to Shanghai on the 25th, saying: "Please take a photo and forward it to General Commander Chiang in Hankou, Jianjian. I have conveyed your instructions in the past. I immediately announced the intentions of Germany and advised Ran San, but it was also ineffective. I then received an order from Commander Mao to order a strong mediation. Therefore, in the midst of an irreparable situation, I still intended to appease the people and personally went to the front to separate the two sides' battle lines in order to maintain peace. The provincial government did not understand and instead suppressed with heavy troops. Now Army Commander Wang has abandoned Guiyang with the hearts of the people [Blank] scattered and has escaped. The military and civilians cheered together and welcomed Commander Mao back to the province to take charge of everything immediately. I am under your command and maintain my appeasement. Fortunately, a peaceful solution was achieved in only two days. The local area is peaceful and the people are comforted. I am very sorry to relieve your worries. I respectfully knock and ask for peace. You Guocai, Deputy Army Commander and Division Commander of the 25th Army of the National Revolutionary Army." [Blank] Mao also telegraphed his resident [Blank] representative, saying: "I have just received a telegram from Army Commander You Cheng, saying that his troops have completely defeated Army Commander Wang on the 25th of this month and occupied Guiyang. Wang Jialie fled to Longli alone and has ordered the collection of defeated soldiers and sent troops to pursue them. I specially present the details. Guangxiang knock, there is noon."</p>
<h3>London Chinese Merchants Association</h3>
<p>Launching the Eighteenth Fast</p>
<p>Proposing a monthly eighteenth day fast to contribute meal expenses to the military</p>
<p>And simultaneously restoring the Mingming Society lecture in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>The London Chinese Merchants Association recently sent a letter to the Municipal Assembly, which is to be forwarded to all organizations nationwide for their consideration. The Eastern Provinces have been lost for over a year now. Initially, we hoped the League of Nations could uphold justice and collectively condemn violence, but it has delayed and procrastinated, leaving us in a desperate situation. It is better to rely on ourselves than to seek help from others. Recalling the words of German Chancellor Bismarck, "International law is merely a matter of power, not justice. It is about blood and iron." If we do not lose our minds and become willing slaves of a fallen nation, we should deeply understand these words and strive together to restore our great land. Fortunately, the Northeastern Volunteer Army, with their unyielding spirit and perseverance, knowing they would rather be shattered jade than whole tiles, are fighting for the dignity of the people and for justice in the international community. If we cannot die on the battlefield alongside the Volunteer Army, how should we work together to provide support? Besides other donations and assistance, we suggest: (1) Every month on the eighteenth, compatriots worldwide should fast for one meal, using the feeling of hunger to remember the sacrifices of our Northeastern Volunteer Army compatriots and donate the saved expenses to the Volunteer Army. (2) On that day, at noon, wherever Chinese people are, they should stand facing the Northeast and swear three times: "I will do my utmost to restore the Three Northeastern Provinces to the Motherland!" (3) On that day, meetings and lectures should be held everywhere to commemorate the victims of the Japanese invasion and to arouse the determination of the people to seek revenge. Your Assembly is the leader of all organizations in our country, the head of the dragon looking forward. Now in managing, we specially suggest this to your Assembly, respectfully requesting that you consider adopting it, establish a method, and notify all Chinese organizations nationwide and worldwide to implement it consistently. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual. We are willing to work together for this. Respectfully submitted by: Wang Jingchou, Chairman of the London Chinese Merchants Association; Weng Shukuang, Document Officer; Li De, Accountant.</p>
<h3>Report on the War Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>A Cleverly Coded Telegram from Tang Yulin and Others Regarding Horse Rearing</p>
<p>Wang Delin's Forces Attack Jilin in Three Routes</p>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association of this city received telegrams yesterday from Commander Tang Yulin and the General Headquarters of the National Salvation Army, reporting on the front-line combat situation. The telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Liaoning Headquarters (abridged): According to a telegram from Secretary Song Jingcheng of Kailu (22nd), based on a report from Liu Zhutang, Zhang Mianming's cavalry unit of over 500 men is stationed in the Haimiao area. 1,000 Japanese cavalry and a regiment of puppet troops with eight artillery pieces advanced to Gaoliban on the 18th. Li Fangting was forced to withdraw from Gaoliban due to pressure. Over 500 Mongolian soldiers are battling Liu Guitang's cavalry in the Tangjiayao Tuwangfu area. Please urgently send mortar shells and rifle bullets, etc. Aside from ordering a rapid replenishment, this is respectfully reported. Liaoning Headquarters, respectfully printed.</p>
<p>Another telegram stated (abridged): Recently received a telegram from Kailu Yang (22nd), reporting that according to a report from Regiment Commander Liu, Zhang Xia dispatched three detachments to cooperate with the Mongolian troops of Tu and Yetu, forcing our army to withdraw from the Gaoliban area. Because winter clothing has not arrived, they want to temporarily avoid their advance, hoping they will withdraw on their own. However, they repeatedly harass us, greatly hindering our forces. To be able to eliminate them and remove the Japanese bandits' puppet organizations and bases, there is a shortage of ammunition, especially 7.9mm bullets. Please quickly send supplies to resist the invaders, etc. Aside from ordering immediate transport and prioritized replenishment, this is respectfully reported. According to a telegram from the Tongjiang Commissioner, the rebel ships Liran and Jiangping defected on the evening of the 19th, and all Japanese advisors and pro-Japanese traitors were killed.

<h3>The Municipal Volunteer Army Rises Again</h3>
<p>Deciding to Reorganize and March Out of the Pass to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee for Departure to the Northeast Established Yesterday</p>
<p>Notification to Dispersed Comrades to Gather in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident, the citizens of Shanghai have been indignant at Japan's barbarity and grieved at the loss of territory. Consequently, the Shanghai Citizens' United Association gathered patriotic volunteers to organize the Municipal Volunteer Army, preparing to march out of the Pass to fight the enemy and recover lost territory. Later, due to the sudden outbreak of the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident, they joined the 19th Route Army and participated in the battle against the Japanese in Zhabei and Wusong. The Municipal Volunteer Army participated in the war of resistance, demonstrating remarkable achievements in the history of defeating the enemy. After the signing of the ceasefire agreement, Brigadier General Weng Zhaoyuan led them to Wuxi for camp training. Later, through the efforts of Cai Tingkai and others, they were disbanded and sent back to Shanghai, leaving these passionate young people with a heart to serve the country but nowhere to use their abilities, which is deeply regrettable. Now, for several months, as the national crisis has become increasingly severe, patriotic volunteers, mindful of the principle that the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual, could not bear to stand by and watch indifferently. Therefore, several comrades jointly initiated, convening former classmates, and decided to reorganize and march out of the Pass to recover lost territory. The comrades of the army held a meeting yesterday (27th) at 9:00 AM at the Datu Temple on North Chengdu Road in the International Settlement to discuss preparatory matters. Those who attended included Zhang Xifan, Huang Shuzhao, Zhang Qihong, Gu Jusheng, Peng Xiuchen, Gong Zhongda, Wang Haiqing, Zhang Yun, Wu Xiaozhou, Gu Guorong, Wang Zhongyi, Leng Tiqiang, Qu Xixi, Ling Derui, Zhu Erqing, Zhang Hao, Jia Fugui, Zhou Yong, Ye Yizhou, Wang Ruizeng, Ku Haisheng, Shen Yimin, Cheng Yangtian, Ku Shurong, Li Jinsheng, Gu Songyun, Liu Zhongwu, Jiang Wenxu, Lu Peiwen, Huang Xiebing, Lu Yong, and over fifty others. Chen Guangxiang, Wang Zhaocheng, Liu Zhongying, Wu Banlu, and Sun Bin, members of the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association, also attended to provide guidance. The meeting officially began with nine rings of the bell. Wang Zhaocheng was elected as chairman and Chen Guangxiang as secretary. After the ceremony and discussion, the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting. Wang Haiqing, Chen Guangxiang, and others reported on the initiation and preparation process, and then discussed the implementation plan. Six key points were agreed upon: (1) The name was set as "Shanghai Municipal Volunteer Army Departure to the Northeast Preparatory Committee." (2) Wang Haiqing, Wang Zhongyi, Gu Guorong, Leng Tiqiang, Zhang Yunhua, Zha Zhida, Cheng Yangtian, Liu Zhongwu, and Peng Xiuchen were elected as the nine members of the preparatory committee. (3) A request will be submitted to the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association to oversee the implementation. (4) The Datu Temple will be temporarily used as the registration office. (5) Newspapers and communication methods will be used to gather comrades for organization. (6) All matters related to advancement will be handled by the preparatory committee. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeastern Compatriots</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Founders' Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeastern Compatriots, initiated by the wives of Li Jishen, Sun Ke, and Wu Tiecheng, held a founders' discussion meeting at the YWCA on Nanjing Road at 2:00 PM on the 27th. Attendees included Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, Central Committee member He Xiangning's representative Ma Jingyun, Mrs. Gan Naikuan, Mrs. Feng Jiasui, Mrs. Li Liejun's representative Bei Limin, Women's Bank President Yan Shuhe, Mrs. Jian of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, Ms. Zhang Lianying representing Liu Wang Liming, Principal Wang Xiaoying of Wuben Girls' Middle School, Mrs. Liu Renhang, and over twenty others. (Mrs. Li Jishen was ill, and Mrs. Sun Ke was unable to attend due to business.) Dr. Zheng Yuxiu was appointed chairman and opened the meeting as scheduled. Chairman Ms. Wang Xiaoying delivered the opening remarks, stating that the association was originally proposed by Mrs. Li Jishen, who is now bedridden in the hospital due to overwork. She entrusted the chairman to express that the Northeast is a part of the whole country and as important as other provinces. For the sake of national salvation and self-preservation, no one can ignore the plight of our Northeastern compatriots. Women account for two-fifths of the country's population, and we have the same passion and sympathy. Due to physiological reasons, we cannot rush to the battlefield, but we have many opportunities to contribute to the rear, such as relief, economic support, and propaganda. Does our women's community have the power to take on these tasks? Premier Sun once told us that unity is power. How can we unite? We must have an organization to unite. Hopefully, the establishment of this association will be the driving force of our women's power and the center of our women's power. Then, Ms. Song Zhennu reported on the preparation process with Mrs. Li. The speaker choked with emotion when mentioning the suffering of the Northeastern compatriots, and the attendees wept. Next, the discussion items were: (1) determining the name of the association, (2) discussing the constitution, (3) designating the attendees today as members of the preparatory committee, and selecting nineteen people from among them as executive committee members, (4) leaving the remaining items to the executive committee for collective discussion and responsible preparation. The following nineteen people were elected on the spot: Mrs. Li Jishen, Mrs. Sun Ke, Mrs. Chen Zhenru, Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Shi Liangcai, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Mrs. Gan Naiyi, Mrs. Jian, Mrs. Deng Jiayan, Mrs. Liu Renhang, Central Committee member Ms. He Xiangning, Women's Bank President Yan Shuhe, Song Zhen, Shu Zhirui, Wang Xiaoying, Wei Ying, Ouyang Huizhen, and Lu Huimin, and other ladies. Finally, Chairman Zheng delivered a speech, saying that the spirit of today's meeting is excellent, and she hopes that our women's community will strive to unite and create a large-scale and lasting organization to fight for the country. We must know that the progress of a country depends on whether the thinking of the women in that country is progressive. Now that the country is in such a difficult situation, we women must quickly work hard and save the country quickly.</p>

Mr. Hu, since childhood, showed intelligence and devoted himself to learning. He was respectful, harmonious, taciturn, and handled matters with order and principle, earning the respect of all. He participated in the war in Europe, braving dangers and hardships. He studied abroad and reached the pinnacle of his field. Upon returning to his homeland, he embodied virtue, kindness, gentleness, and respectfulness. He moved to Shanghai, taking up his post with dedication. For seven years, he worked diligently. Suddenly, news of his tragic death came, leaving us devastated. The pillar has collapsed, and the loss is heartrending. His mother is in the hall, his wife and children are beside us.

The sudden and tragic news is shocking. It not only means that the Municipal Government has lost a capable assistant, but also that the citizens of the city will suffer a major blow. After the January 28th Incident this year, corpses littered the fields in Jiangwan and Wusong. People initially feared that a major epidemic was imminent. However, the former Director Hu worked tirelessly to plan and implement epidemic prevention measures after the end of the war. Therefore, the mortality statistics for this year are lower than in other places. This is all due to the efforts of the former Director Hu. Therefore, on behalf of the various agencies, schools, and organizations in this city, I offer my deepest condolences to the spirit of the former Director Hu." In addition, speeches were given by Director Liu Ruiheng of the National Health Administration and representatives of the Chinese Medical Association, with their content summarized for brevity.</p>
<p>Report on Life Story Originally, the wife of Director Hu was scheduled to report on Mr. Hu's life. However, due to her extreme grief and inability to speak, Mr. Hu's younger brother delivered the report, stating: "Mr. Hu began his dedication to medical life after the founding of the Republic of China. During the European War, he went to Europe to assist the American Red Cross. After returning to China, he once served as a professor and managed epidemic prevention efforts in various places. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, with the introduction of the American Ran Ansen, he went to the United States to study, and in the thirteenth year he obtained his doctorate. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Qingdao Puji Hospital. In the fourteenth year, he resigned and returned home. During the era of the Shanghai-Songhu Merchant Port, Mr. Hu served as the Deputy Director of the Shanghai-Songhu Health Bureau. After the revolutionary army recovered Shanghai, Mr. Hu was promoted to Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, which he held for seven years. The occurrence of this unfortunate incident has caused extreme grief to the entire family. We express our gratitude to all sectors for their condolences."</p>
<p>Family's Expression of Gratitude The family representative, Hu's elder brother Banming, stated: "My younger brother Hongji suffered an unexpected tragedy. The Municipal Government, various bureaus, departments, organizations, and schools have remembered my brother's humble efforts and diligent work in Shanghai over the years. They initiated this memorial service, and we are deeply grateful to the party and government officials, representatives, and all relatives and friends who have honored us with their presence, bestowed generous donations, and composed grand elegies. The family is deeply saddened and distraught. My nephews and nieces are young and ignorant of protocol. Their failure to properly express gratitude is a great fault. We will deeply engrave the kindness of all in our hearts, inform our nephews and nieces, instill in them a sense of responsibility, use this support for their education, so that they can establish themselves and carry on his legacy, to repay your great kindness. "According to the family representative, Mr. Hu had three sons, named Weisheng, Zaisheng, and Ansheng, and two daughters, named Feifei and Xiaomei. The oldest is only five years old, and the youngest is still being nursed. The atmosphere was very somber. After the ceremony in the morning, the condolence visits began in the afternoon. It is reported that the collected donations will be used for the education of Mr. Hu's children.</p>

<h3>Robbery at Jifu Lane, Ningbo Road</h3>
<h3>One Robber Killed, One Captured</h3>
<p>More than Thirty People Confined to the Back Room for Two Hours as Five Robbers Searched and Plundered. A Large Group of Detectives Suddenly Burst in, Leading to a Fierce Battle, Leaving Bullet Marks on the Walls.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM, a robbery occurred at Jifu Lane on Ningbo Road. Detectives apprehended the robbers on the spot, leading to a fight in which one robber was killed and another captured. The details from the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Well-Dressed Robbers Jifu Lane on Ningbo Road is the former name, now known as No. 457 Lane. The lane primarily consists of commercial establishments. The ten-house shikumen, a three-story building, has Yuan Yu Cotton Cloth Shop and Yongchang Shop on the right side of the ground floor, and Ju Kang Shop on the left. The upper floors are rented by the San Yi New Motor Silk Weaving Factory and Guangfu Chang Shop. Managers of each shop have their families residing in the premises, totaling about thirty people. At approximately 5:45 PM yesterday afternoon, five young men, all well-dressed, suddenly arrived at the building. One of them closed the main gate, two went straight upstairs, and two others entered the Yuan Yu Shop on the right side of the ground floor. The employees of the shop were having dinner. Seeing the young men enter, they assumed they were there for business. However, the two men pulled out guns, forbidding anyone from making a sound, and drove all the employees into the back room of the shop. At the same time, the two men upstairs also forced all the people upstairs downstairs and confined them into the same back room.</p>
<p>Search and Plunder for About Two Hours After the robbers confined all the men, women, and children into the back room, they demanded the keys to the silver safes from the employees of each shop. Only Yuan Yu Shop handed over a key to an ordinary silver safe. The robbers assigned one person to guard the door of the back room with a gun, two searched and plundered downstairs, and two returned upstairs, ransacking every drawer and box. From 5:45 PM to 7:20 PM, the search continued. As there was little of value in each shop, the robbers were not satisfied and re-entered the back room, intimidating the people once again. The quarrel became protracted. One of the robbers fired a shot into the ground as a warning, but the employees remained unmoved. Seeing that the demonstration was ineffective, one of the robbers turned to the Yuan Yu Shop employees, threatening them to hand over another silver safe key. The employees claimed it was with the manager, so the robbers remained unsuccessful.</p>
<p>One Robber Dies, One Captured Just as the conflict was ongoing, a large group of detectives arrived outside the gate. Seeing that the gate was tightly closed, they knocked on the door. Hearing the sound, the robbers panicked. As they turned to flee, the detectives broke down the door. Half of them rushed into the left side room, finding it empty, so they entered the right side room. The two robbers in the room had already retreated. Each began to fire at the detectives. One robber took advantage of the chaos and ran straight out of the gate, escaping down the lane. Another robber was about to flee when he was spotted by a detective. The detective ordered him to stop. The robber was captured. At the same time, one of the robbers guarding the back room saw that the situation had been exposed and planned to flee. He hid near the door and fired at the detectives, resisting arrest. The detectives fired back, exchanging fire for over thirty shots. The robber was shot and fell to the ground. The two robbers upstairs heard the gunfire and realized that things were going badly. They fled to the rooftop, escaping across the roofs. When another group of detectives went upstairs, they were too late to pursue them.</p>
<p>Statistics on Losses in Each Shop After the detectives killed one robber and captured another, they released the people from the back room and, together, inspected the losses in each room. Ju Kang lost about 100 yuan, Yuan Yu lost about 30 yuan, and Yongchang, because no one was there, was not robbed. San Yi New Motor Silk Weaving Factory lost three bank notes and 30 yuan in cash. Guangfu Chang suffered the heaviest losses, with 50 yuan in cash and jewelry worth about 800 yuan stolen. The walls of the back room were covered in bullet marks, and the glass in front of a cabinet was shattered. The robber who fell to the ground was dead. His body lay across the doorway of the right side room, covered in blood. He was about 27 or 28 years old, wearing a wool hat and a long gray plain Mao Ge robe. Upon inspecting his body, there were six bullet wounds. A portion of the stolen goods was found. The police station transported the body to the Fei Lun Road coroner's office and took the captured robber into custody. Other detectives were dispatched to pursue the remaining robbers. The deceased robber was named Xiao Sanbao.</p>
<h3>Han Traitor Murder Case</h3>
<p>Continued Interrogation of the Murderer of Ji Jintang</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the area under the jurisdiction of District Three, Section Five of the Hu Jia Mu Bridge and Xiangyan Bridge in Hongkou was the first to be occupied by the Japanese army. A group of Jiangbei hooligans willingly became traitors, joining the Japanese military headquarters to serve as accomplices, taking the opportunity to rob merchants of their property and opening opium dens and gambling dens in the area. Hu Lifu, Wang Du, and others were the leaders, including those from the entire Zhabei area. Those in the Hu Jia Mu Bridge area, according to the accusations of Ji Wu and others, included Wang Shubao, Wang Thirtyzi, and Zheng Xiaoheizi (aka Zheng Baocheng), three or four people in total. They obtained pistols issued by the Japanese and engaged in bullying their compatriots, confiscating the belongings of passersby to fill their own pockets. Later, they opened gambling dens. Ji Zhongtang, a former detective who had just been released from prison and was also from Jiangbei, went to the area hoping to share in the profits based on his previous position. However, he was shot and killed by Wang and others in a teahouse. This occurred in mid-February of this year. The death of Ji Zhongtang was of no more significance than that of an ant. The Japanese military police immediately ordered his body to be collected and naturally protected the perpetrators. Ji's family and apprentices remained silent, requesting the local bailiff Xu Jinlin to have the body examined at the Nanshi District Court the next day and accuse Wang and the other two. They were instructed to arrest them after the war had ended. After the ceasefire agreement was reached and the lost territory was gradually recovered, all the traitors lost their protection. Wang Thirtyzi, Zheng Xiaoheizi, and others used their ill-gotten wealth to open shops in the area, pretending to be honest merchants, causing righteous merchants to grumble about the world of evildoers. However, their ostentatious behavior attracted the attention of the authorities. Therefore, the three criminals urgently sought a private settlement with Ji Zhongtang's apprentices, who had reported them at the time, claiming that they did not recognize them and that it was someone else who committed the crime. However, Ji's wife, Ji Wu, had already reported the case to the court and District Three, Section Five. The police discovered that Zheng Xiaoheizi was celebrating his mother's birthday at home last month and went to arrest him on the spot. The other two Wangs escaped. Zheng was immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau and then to the District Court for investigation. Yesterday, he was interrogated again by the prosecutor. Zheng's family filed a petition claiming he was wronged and requesting bail, which the court naturally denied. The court also ordered the arrest of Wang Shubao and Wang Thirtyzi to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>The Flashlight Shone</h3>
<p>Scaring the Extortionist into Capture</p>
<p>Reaching into the Trash Can</p>
<p>His Face Lit Up with Joy</p>
<p>Just as He Was About to Flee</p>
<p>Detectives Surrounded Him from All Sides</p>
<p>Gordong Road No. 161, Shanghai Beer Factory, chief carter Gao Yushu, received two threatening letters starting on the 5th of this month, intending to extort 500 yuan. On the 22nd, he received a third letter, instructing him to send a representative with the money to the trash can on the telegraph pole at No. 27 Lane, Anren Street, Min'guo Road, in the Chinese district between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM the next evening. Someone would come to pick it up. If he did not comply, they would resort to extreme measures. Gao took the letter and reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station. The police chief dispatched Chinese Detective Wu Changkai and Bao Detective Zhang Changkun, along with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, to guard the location. However, because the lane was quite long and there were no places to hide on all sides, the detectives decided that Detective Wu would obtain the consent of a mansion opposite the telegraph pole in the lane to hide in the room and observe. Any movement would be signaled by a flashlight. The other detectives would be scattered around in ambush. They put newspapers in a paper bag to make it look like 200 yuan and put it in the trash can. After waiting for a long time, at 8:30 PM, two robbers arrived, pacing back and forth in the lane. Seeing that there was no one around, one robber reached into the trash can, took out the paper bag, and his face lit up with joy. Just as he was about to flee, Detective Wu showed no mercy and shone the flashlight. Detectives gathered from all sides and arrested the two robbers. They were first taken to the Public Security Bureau for detention, and then taken back to the police station the next morning. They were then transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Zhen took the stand and first questioned the defendants about their names, ages, and hometowns. The defendants claimed their names were Li Hongqi (the one who reached in and took the money), from Tianjin, and Zhou Fabao, from Huzhou. Then, the police lawyer Wang Tang stepped forward and stated the above situation, requesting an extension and detention of the two defendants. Judge Wu granted the request and ordered Li and Zhou to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Children Playing with Fire Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>An Accident Occurred Last Night in Ma'an Lane</p>
<p>Two of Three Children Burned to Death</p>
<p>Wang Gu, a thirty-two-year-old woman from Suzhou, lived with her three daughters in a garret at 641 Ma'an Lane, Maurice Road, in the Public Concession. The eldest daughter, Gendi, was eleven years old, the second daughter, Nuannuan, was five years old, and the youngest daughter, Qiaofeng, was only two years old. Last night around 10:00 PM, Nuannuan was hungry and wanted a snack. Wang went out to buy something. Only the three children remained in the room. Gendi liked to play with matches. After lighting them, she lit the kerosene lamp, making it very bright. Inadvertently, the kerosene lamp fell on the bedding and suddenly caught fire. The curtains and mats were mostly flammable materials. In an instant, smoke filled the room, flames shot out, and the fire broke through the roof. By the time Wang returned home, the fire was already out of control. Nuannuan, though young, was quick-witted and escaped the fire, preserving her life. The two older and younger children were buried in the fire, their heads charred, a tragic sight to behold. The fire department arrived in vehicles to put out the fire, extinguishing it after some time. The bodies of the children were sent to the Bao Lung Hospital in a hearse to await examination.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, city Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team officer Bian Chunlin and others were patrolling the river to the Ning Shao Wharf at 16th Shed, when they saw the Wanxiang Steamer docked there and not yet sailing. They boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. They found three Fujian women, Wang Tang, Ding Wang, and Li Ren, each holding an infant in swaddling clothes in the steerage. Seeing the police arrive, they immediately looked flustered and suspicious. When asked about the origin of the children, they were evasive. They were immediately taken to the team. When Zhu, the team leader, preliminarily interrogated the case, Wang Tang and others claimed that the children they were holding were all purchased from the countryside in Pudong. They were now planning to take them back to their hometown as their own sons. Because the matter concerned trafficking in persons, they were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Fang Rongzhou's Daughter</h3>
<p>Sues for Inheritance</p>
<p>To Divide 300,000 into Six Shares</p>
<p>Requesting Investigation of the Yuanyuan Sugar Trading House Accounting Books</p>
<p>The Fang family of Zhenhai is known for its wealth. They operate many businesses in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other ports. The Yuanyuan Sugar Trading House in Shanghai was founded by Fang Rongzhou. Rongzhou had four sons and three daughters: Meng Ruinian, Zhong Funian, Shu Zunian, and Ji Wennian. Funian and Zunian died early. Xinru left behind two sons, named Zigang and Ziqin. As for the three daughters, the eldest, Zhiqing, is also deceased. The second, Jinqing, married a Chen. The youngest, Youqing, married into the Fang family. Rongzhou passed away in the early years of the Republic of China, leaving behind an inheritance of hundreds of thousands. In the previous year, Ruinian and his brothers, uncles, and nephews divided it into four parts. At that time, laws on women inheriting property had already been promulgated, but Ruinian and others did not legally distribute Jinqing's and Youqing's rights. Recently, Youqing hired lawyer Wang Shizong to file a lawsuit against Ruinian and others in the First Special District Court, demanding that the 300,000 inheritance be divided equally into six shares and requesting that the accounting books of the Yuanyuan Sugar Trading House be examined to prove that the capital of the house belonged to Rongzhou. The defendant also hired a lawyer to argue that the plaintiff had no right to divide the property. The First Special Court repeatedly opened court to hear the case. The other day, Judge Qiao opened the court. After the plaintiff and defendant lawyers argued, the judge announced that the sentence would be announced at a later date.</p>
<h3>News from the National Federation of All Circles for National Salvation</h3>
<p>Sending Personnel North to Comfort the Troops;</p>
<p>Telegram Urging Sichuan Army to Cease Internal Strife</p>
<p>Since its establishment on the 30th of last month, the National Federation of All Circles for National Salvation has been working exceptionally hard for national salvation. Because the righteous armies outside the passes are fighting bloody battles against the enemy in the icy and snowy lands, striving for the survival of the motherland, the Federation has specially dispatched directors Zhang Jie and Feng Guo, and others, carrying goods, to offer comfort and to conduct an on-the-ground investigation of the anti-Japanese situation of the righteous armies. They already departed north on the Beijing-Shanghai express train at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 26th). Those who saw them off included more than one hundred people from various public organizations in Shanghai, such as the Chinese Women's Rights Movement Grand Alliance, and Federation directors Zhang Junguang and Zuo Hua. It is heard that this trip will take two months before they can return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Federation, in light of the unresolved Sichuan war, specifically telegraphed urging for cessation of hostilities, stating: Sichuan (title omitted). Your area and the salt wells are being brutally invaded and occupied by Japan. All Chinese are filled with indignation and heartache, and are willing to go together to face the national crisis and reduce our daily meals to that end. Now, instead of saving the country from danger, your armies are engaging in fratricidal strife, harming each other like beans and stalks, leading to ridicule from foreign nations and providing ammunition for their attacks. Our Federation, with a sincere heart, earnestly advises your armies to quickly cease internal strife, reorganize your forces, and jointly resist the brutal Japanese for the sake of the country and the nation (remainder omitted).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Federation telegraphed Jiang Guangnai in Fuzhou, stating (in brief): Your army's current suppression of bandits in Fujian will undoubtedly lead to significant achievements in the renewal of Fujian's administration. However, the reorganization of the Fujian provincial government is being delayed. At this time of suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression, military and political affairs should naturally be carried out in full cooperation. It is hoped that you, sir, will overcome all difficulties and promptly recommend individuals from Fujian province who possess revolutionary history and are respected by the public to serve as chairman, and that you will join with overseas Chinese in the construction of politics and economics.</p>

Now, this Ministry is donating 100 yuan, to be remitted through the Shanghai Bank. We are also enclosing the original donation booklet and returning it with this letter. Please check and separately acknowledge receipt, and please provide a receipt for our records.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Inspection of Airplanes</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation Telegraphs Ministry for Instructions</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou up and down line aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation in this city have always been inspected by the military police of the Garrison Headquarters when taking off and landing at the airfield. Unexpectedly, the Jianghai Customs recently sent a letter to the company stating: According to orders from the Ministry of Finance, inspections will be carried out on aircraft takeoffs and landings, and the company is requested to provide a room at Longhua Airport for customs officials to work in. However, the company believes that aviation is not navigation and is not related to customs, so it is inconvenient to agree. It has telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation for instructions on how to proceed.</p>

<h3>Various Parties Fundraising to Aid the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>Ma Yinchu Runs Around to Raise Funds. Ma Yinchu, a member of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Committee, replied yesterday to Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Area Relief Association, stating: I have received your kind instructions, as well as the Relief Association's declaration, brief regulations, and donation booklet. I deeply admire your benevolence and concern for the people. The recovered areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei have been devastated for a long time and urgently need fundraising for relief. You have instructed me, Yinchu, to widely solicit donations, and I dare not disobey. However, for the past few months, I have been traveling between Beijing and Hangzhou to raise funds for the Northeastern Righteous Army. All those I have interacted with have been persuaded until my tongue and lips are sore. I am ashamed of my limited strength and cannot handle two tasks at once. I am returning the donation booklet. When the fundraising here is completed, I will report back. In terms of the righteousness of saving the country and the people, there is no difference. Gentlemen, you are discerning, so I dare to state the reasons and hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>Native Association Holds Meeting to Assist. The Shanghai Fujian Native Association held its second executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Xie Yinpo was publicly elected as chairman.

<h3>Jiangsu Rice Association Members' Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ning-Hu City and County Rice Industry Association held its second members' annual meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at Cuixiutang. A total of 28 members from nine public associations attended. Zhao Zixin was publicly elected as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman reported that since the death of the association's chairman, Ye Huijun, no replacement has been appointed, which seems insufficient to show solemnity. At the last meeting, it was resolved to wait until the members' annual meeting to re-elect. Today is the annual meeting, and it is urgent to appoint a chairman to emphasize association affairs. It was also proposed to elect Mr. Yan Xiaoquan as a standing committee member, which was put to a vote. It was unanimously approved. As for the vacancy of the executive committee member, it was filled by the alternate executive committee member Pan Xianting. The vacancy of the alternate executive committee member was filled by Xu Shanqing, who had the next highest number of votes. As for the position of chairman, Zhao Zixin was elected through mutual election among the standing committee members. Regarding the Zhenjiang proposal to request the provincial government to implement the circulation of rice and grain from various provinces to alleviate farmers' difficulties, (resolved) The association had already telegraphed the provincial government to request instructions, but no reply has been received to date. A telegram should be sent again to request a prompt order to circulate rice and grain to provide relief. Furthermore, the Wujiang County proposal stated that the Shanghai rice and grain industry has changed to using weighing instruments to measure rice, and suggested that it would be difficult for the counties in the interior to change, so the proposal should be withdrawn. (Resolved) Send a letter to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association for reference. Another Wujiang proposal suggested organizing a rice industry bank. (Resolved) This matter is of great importance, and in the current economic downturn, planning is difficult. We should wait for an opportunity to discuss it again. Subsequently, the preliminary income and expenditure accounts for the current year were reported, and members were urged to pay their dues for application.</p>

<h3>Continued News on Chen Tianxiao's National Crisis Solo Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Pan Wanqing Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>Doctor Said Injuries Were Light</p>
<p>Died at Home</p>
<p>Pan Wang, an Anhui woman residing at No. 8, Lane 17, Haichao Temple Road, South City, is 36 years old and has a son named Wanqing, 14 years old. At around 8:00 PM the night before, Wanqing was playing at the intersection of Lujiabang when a freight car suddenly came speeding and knocked Wanqing down before he could avoid it. The wheels rolled over his abdomen, causing him to faint from his injuries. The driver, seeing that he had caused an accident, immediately sped away. Fortunately, the police officer Di Zhaorong from the local police station arrived and recorded the license plate number of the car, Third 418, and sent Wanqing to Nanyang Hospital at Xiaonanmen for treatment. After a brief examination by the doctor, it was said that the injuries were light and there was no danger to his life. At that time, his mother, Pan Wang, also arrived after hearing the news and took Wanqing home. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 AM the next morning, Wanqing died of his injuries. In her grief, Pan Wang reported the situation to the Third Section of the First District. Police Chief Jin immediately dispatched Police Officer Zhang Hongxun to bring the car owner, Liu Ziqiao, and the driver, Zhou Zhihong, to the police station for preliminary interrogation based on the license plate number Third 418. According to Liu Ziqiao, 47 years old, from Tongzhou, he owns freight car No. 3418 of the Liu Ziji Motor Vehicle Company at No. 77 Kangti Road in the French Concession. The day before, the machine was damaged and was being repaired at a certain car shop in Lujiabang. Last night, because the car had been repaired, he ordered the driver Zhou Zhihong to drive the car back. He did not know anything else. When questioned, Zhou Zhihong, 27 years old, from Yancheng, stated that he is a driver for the Liu Ziji Motor Vehicle Company. Last night, he was ordered by the owner to go to Lujiabang to drive the car back. Unexpectedly, Pan Wanqing was lying behind the car. When the car passed near Haichao Temple, the child accidentally lost his grip and fell to the ground. He does not know anything else. Given that the child fell from behind the car, how could the wheels have rolled over his body? This is obviously a cunning excuse to shirk responsibility. As the matter concerns human life, he was ordered to prepare a document and send him to the bureau for interrogation. On one hand, the 23rd police station was dispatched to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an inquest. At around 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Yang, who was appointed by the court, arrived at the scene for an inquest and determined that the deceased, Pan Wanqing, had died of injuries sustained during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his family for coffin preparation and burial.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Native Goods Store</h3>
<p>The Yuanda Gong Native Goods Store at Bei Fujian Road, north of Laozha Bridge in the Public Concession, was settling accounts at around 8:00 PM last night when three robbers suddenly arrived. Two held pistols, and one stood guard in front of the door. The two robbers jumped into the store, drew their pistols, and threatened them not to make a sound. They forcibly seized the cash on the counter, totaling 48 yuan, as well as coins. They went out and fled north. At that time, someone was getting married at a restaurant across from the store, holding a banquet for guests. The robbers dared to commit robbery in a busy city. The store staff did not dare to pursue the robbers because they had pistols. They reported the incident to the police station afterward, requesting an arrest.</p>
<h3>Two People Died Tragically</h3>
<p>A Young Woman from Jiangbei Dies from Opium. Wang Chen, a young woman from Jiangbei, 26 years old, lived upstairs at the Laoyuan Tai Hotel on Bei Chujia Qiao, French Concession. The night before, she had an argument with her aunt and, in a moment of despair, secretly took opium and committed suicide. She was later discovered and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but died at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>A Car Crushes a Gold Star Hardware Store Apprentice to Death. Liu Xincai, a 17-year-old apprentice from Ningbo at the Gold Star Hardware Store at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Shigaota Road, was riding a bicycle out to pick up goods at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. As he was traveling through the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road, a public bus, license plate number 15060, was coming from the front. Unable to avoid it in time, he was knocked to the ground and his skull was crushed, resulting in instant death. The police arrived after hearing the news, recorded the license plate number, and then sent the body to Tongren Hospital by car and then to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<h3>Fire at Wan'an Street</h3>
<p>At 4:50 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at the Minsheng Industrial Raw Materials Factory at No. 10 Wan'an Street in the city. Zhu Shilin, a guard from the First Branch of the Second District, immediately reported the incident to the police station by telephone and notified the fire brigade. Section Chief Shen also dispatched Police Officer Ma Yumin with policemen to the scene to maintain order. When the fire brigade's pumpers arrived, they tried their best to extinguish the fire. However, the fire was very fierce, and the firewood of Zhao Xiangshan, the sub-tenant of No. 8, was piled next to the chimney of the Minsheng Factory, causing the fire to spread very violently. After all the fire engines arrived, the fire was finally extinguished. It is estimated that the Minsheng Industrial Raw Materials Factory at No. 10 was completely destroyed, and the fire also spread to the neighboring Nos. 8, 6, 12, and 16 (only half of No. 16 was destroyed), totaling more than ten houses destroyed. After the incident, the arsonist had already fled. Only Liu Azhuang, a 14-year-old apprentice from Hangzhou at the Minsheng Factory, Ren Jianzhi, 19 years old, a rickshaw puller with the surname Zhu, and Yao Xiuquan, 44 years old, a tenant of No. 8, were detained and brought to the police station. After interrogation by Section Chief Shen, Ren Jianzhi stated that he pulls a rickshaw for Song Ligong, a former district officer of the Fourth District in No. 10. Today, in the evening, the chimney of the material preparation stove inside the Minsheng Industrial Raw Materials Factory, where I live, was burning day and night and was very fierce. The firewood of the sub-tenant of No. 8 was piled inside. I was working outside. When I went back today, I saw a fire on the way, so I came together. Section Chief Shen verified the statement and, as Wu Fushi, the sub-tenant of the Minsheng Factory, was at large, it was decided to further investigate whether there was any arson and then verify the matter.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Petition of Wireless Station Staff Representatives</h3>
<p>Xie Chunpu and others, standing committee members of the Traffic Department's National Wireless Station Staff Tongyi General Association, representing the wireless station staff across the country, went to Beijing by night train last night to petition for the promulgation of the Regulations for Wireless Operators. This has already been reported in yesterday's newspaper.

They are scheduled to go to the Ministry tomorrow morning with Sha Zonggan of the Nanjing Station Staff Tongyi Branch to submit their request.

It is also reported that the station staff Tongyi branches in various locations such as International Hankou, Qingdao, and Shanghai have jointly submitted reports to the Telecommunications Administration, unanimously planning for the request.</p>
<h3>Exquisitely Crafted Fake Guns Indistinguishable from Real Ones</h3>
<p>Formerly Used by the General Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>Confiscated by the Police and Ordered Confiscated</p>
<p>Chen Ruhai, a Chinese detective of the Huishan Police Station, learned that the Huaxingchang Machine Factory at No. 607 Maohai Road was privately hiding military firearms. He reported this to the police chief, who obtained Search Warrant No. 5072 from the First Special Court. At 10:45 AM the other day, Chief Detective Walter of the Western District and Detective Chen went to search the factory and seized 45 fake rifles and 47 bayonets. These fake weapons were exceptionally well-made, with mechanisms and appearance almost identical to real guns. The only difference was that they could not be loaded and fired. According to the factory's responsible personnel, these fake guns were custom-made by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce School for use in training the volunteer corps. Later, the school did not accept the goods because the style differed from the original design, so they were left in the factory. Since the detectives determined that the items were not real guns, they did not arrest anyone, but took the fake guns and bayonets back to the police station. They were then sent to the summary court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, requested the court to decide how to dispose of these guns and knives. Chief Detective of the Western District submitted a report on the circumstances of the search and seizure, and Magistrate Huang Risheng reviewed the report and ordered all items seized to be confiscated according to the list.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promulgates Second Table of Curriculum for Senior and Junior High Schools</h3>
<p>Four Differences from the Previous Curriculum</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education yesterday issued an order to the education bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating: "The Table of Subjects and Credits for General Science Courses for Junior and Senior High Schools was previously promulgated and implemented by the Ministry in August and October of the 18th year of the Republic, along with the Provisional Standards for Curriculum. In August of this year, the Ministry held a revision conference for the curriculum standards of senior and junior high schools, and formulated the Table of Teaching and Self-Study Hours per Week for Each Subject in Each Semester of Senior and Junior High Schools, which was approved by the conference. This Table of Hours is significantly different from the previous Provisional Standards in terms of subjects and credits. (1) Because secondary education is still based on the academic year system, and teaching of each subject is still calculated by time, the credit system is abolished to avoid confusion in calculating credits and teaching time. (2) Junior high school extends the basic training of elementary school, and senior high school cultivates a good foundation for entering university. All subjects and time have been carefully reviewed and recorded, without adding a burden on students. Therefore, compulsory subjects are abolished in both senior and junior high schools. (3) In accordance with the central resolution, Party Principles teaching materials should be incorporated into subjects such as Civics, History, and Geography, and no longer be set up as a separate subject of Party Principles. (4) Stipulating self-study hours allows for the proper allocation of students' total daily learning time, to achieve a balance between work and rest, and not hinder physical and mental development. In addition, the Second Table of Teaching and Self-Study Hours per Week for Each Subject in Each Semester of Senior and Junior High Schools was formulated, adding Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and second foreign languages to accommodate the special needs of various regions. The above two tables have been reviewed and corrected by the Ministry and are promulgated by ministerial order. The table is hereby attached, twenty copies each. Please instruct all subordinate middle schools to follow them uniformly from the next semester. This order is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>Chinese Team Selected for the International Race Walking</h3>
<p>Shi Jinsheng and Zhou Yuyu and Four Others</p>
<p>Preliminary Score of Two Hours Thirteen and a Half Minutes</p>
<p>Shi Jinsheng Sets a New Record</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai International Race Walking will be held on December 4th. The China Race Walking Association held a preliminary practice session yesterday. More than 30 people registered to participate. However, as it is not appropriate for too many Chinese to participate in this International Race Walking competition, the most important thing is the team. Therefore, those who are younger, such as Wang Mengmao, and those with slightly inferior results were temporarily postponed from participating. As a result, all the athletes bravely moved forward, competing for the top spot, resulting in most people's scores being better than last year's. This is also due to mutual encouragement and hard training. The first to arrive was still Shi Jinsheng, followed by Wan Jinwen, etc. The Chinese team representatives were then selected from Shi Quansheng, Ge Jinwen, Xie Xingdao, and Zhou Yuyu. Although Zhou did not finish the course yesterday, it is well known that Zhou has considerable results, and he won the championship in 1930. He only suffered from abdominal pain yesterday and had to withdraw in Beitang Road. Therefore, after consideration by Shi Youhui, Zhang Zaocun, Lu Yutian, etc., it was decided that Zhou would still be the representative. Zhou is a familiar committee member and is more confident. Yao Yaying, Wang Zhaoxiang, Cheng Yi, Lv Wenxia, and Zhang Zaojiu were selected as reserve members. Others such as Meng Guangming, Wang Jiabao, and Zhang Zhihe are participating individually. It is hoped that all participating athletes will be careful about their diet and sleep within this week and should not exercise strenuously during practice in order to strive for a competitive advantage in the big game. The scores of each person are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shi Jinsheng 2 hours, 13 and a half minutes</p>
<p>(2) Ge Jinwen 2 hours, 29 minutes</p>
<p>(3) Xie Yingdao 2 hours, 32 and a half minutes</p>
<p>(4) Yao Yaying 2 hours, 35 minutes, 4 seconds</p>
<p>(5) Wang Zhaoxiang 2 hours, 37 minutes</p>
<p>(6) Cheng Xuan 2 hours, 39 minutes, 20 seconds</p>
<p>(7) Lv Wenxia 2 hours, 50 minutes, 10 seconds</p>
<p>(8) Zhang Zaojiu 2 hours, 50 minutes, 10 seconds</p>
<p>(9) Meng Guangming 2 hours, 44 minutes, 20 seconds</p>
<p>(10) Wang Jiabao 2 hours, 45 minutes</p>

The first half ended zero to zero. In the last quarter of an hour, each team scored once. The audience was packed, like Yiyuan, with about 18,000 people, setting a new record for the baseball field. Mayor Wu Tiecheng performed the opening kick-off ceremony. Western football clubs and the National Sports Association will host banquets tonight and tomorrow night. Some of the players will travel south on Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Ceremonial Kick-Off</h3>
<p>Numerous Chinese and foreign guests and spectators graced the occasion, attracting considerable attention. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by his young son, Youliang, made a spirited appearance on the field for the ceremonial kick-off. Seizing the opportune moment, Shen Siliang requested the Mayor to perform the honors for this grand match. With a powerful kick by the Mayor, the fierce competition began.</p>

<h3>First Half: 0-0</h3>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Repels the Enemy</p>
<p>As three o'clock approached, the heroes of both teams entered the field in an orderly fashion. After a brief warm-up, the silver whistle blew, and after the Mayor's kick, the battle commenced. The southern team aggressively advanced northwards. Bradley took the lead, with Pado providing central support, and Bradley launched an attack on the western flank, breaking through the central defense line and heading straight for the Chinese goal. Jiang Shanjing roared, rushing out to intercept. Li Yichen then led his forces in a counter-attack.</p>
<p>The Brave Li Ning Defends Against Two Armies</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang initiated an uprising on the eastern outskirts, with Xiao Heitan (Little Black Coal) not wanting to be outdone, launching a fierce offensive directly into the heavy defense. Lau Mau, not wanting to appear weak, launched a diagonal attack, overcoming difficulties. Cheng Siu-hong unleashed his forces on the eastern flank. Tu Kaiyuan, unable to stop them, faced an extremely critical situation as the wolves entered the house. Li Ning, with his formidable spirit, arrived in time. Zheng, realizing the gravity of the situation, made a short pass to Wong Mei-shun, but before he could take several steps, the pass was intercepted by Li Ning and passed forward.</p>
<p>Leung Wing-chiu's Lone Rescue</p>
<p>The ball seemed to be bewitched, darting east and west, disregarding the defensive lines. Feng Yunyou and Huo Wei competed in a 50-meter sprint. Ju Kaiyuan intercepted the ball skillfully, passing it to Xiao Heitan, who advanced, relentlessly penetrating the defense like a violent storm. Hongguang, Yichen, and other generals had already approached the city. Lau Mau and Mullen met the enemy separately, but they were outnumbered. Luo Gun was like a fish in a pot, helpless. Leung Wing-chiu, increasingly frustrated, returned to the defensive line and, finding an opportunity, launched a shot, clearing the danger and temporarily bringing calm to the Hong Kong goal.</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Dribbles Like a Lion</p>
<p>Under Huo Wei's command, a major counter-attack was launched. Bradley was as cunning as a hare. Although Jiang Shanjing was happy to respect the player but not the ball, the ball dropped low. Feng Yunyou caught up to snatch it, but Bradley had already passed it to the center. Li Ning and Mei-shun jumped up simultaneously, but neither made contact. Sun, with his iron legs, was lying in ambush on the side, sweeping the ball away from the goal. Zheng Siu-hong and Huo, quick as lightning, had already reached the front of the goal. Zhou Xianyan leaped up, seized the ball, and sent it out of danger, dribbling like a lion, earning thunderous applause.</p>
<p>Cheng Siu-hong, Like a Tiger in a Cage</p>
<p>Sometimes to the south, sometimes to the north, the game changed constantly. Although the Chinese forwards were brave, the Hong Kong goalkeeper's great improvement made it difficult to score. The Hong Kong team's wing attacks were also anticipated by the Chinese defense. Cheng Siu-hong was closely guarded by Liang Shutang, like a tiger in a cage, unable to unleash his power, making it difficult for the Hong Kong team to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>0-0: No Progress Made</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu dribbled the ball into enemy territory, with Chen Yutian supporting him on the side. Li Yichen aided the attack, dribbling past Pado. Leung Wing-chiu skillfully used a back pass. Tu Kaiyuan sat firmly at the boundary line, strictly inspecting for spies. Xiao Heitan and Chen Hongguang echoed each other, sending the ball back and forth. Ma Lun soared into the air. The ball returned to the center of the field, where both teams continued their efforts. However, time was not on their side, and the "lemon time" (end of the half) had arrived, with both sides scoreless.</p>

<h3>Second Half: 1-1</h3>
<p>Both Sides Maintain a Tense Stalemate</p>
<p>The athletes from both teams took a short rest, revitalizing their spirits. After switching sides, they resumed the battle, with both sides creating dangerous situations. For 35 minutes, neither team was able to break the deadlock. Xiao Heitan frequently scratched his head, and the 21,000 spectators were both startled and amused, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The situation was tense and difficult to break.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Adjusts Defense to Cope with the Critical Situation</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's defense was under pressure, with frequent warning signs. The key defender, Mullen, had suffered an injury in the first half. To strengthen the defense, they reorganized their line, with Pado retreating to the rear to replace Mullen. Wong Mei-shun returned to her forte in the central defense, guarding the interior and supporting all sides. Huo remained in the interior, while Zhou Lun took on the role of midfielder.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Between Two Armies: Chen Jiaqiu Jumps to Head the Ball (Li Zunxi)</p>
<p>Close But No Cigar: What a Pity</p>
<p>The Chinese team's repeated attacks all ended in vain. Although the opportunities were good, they were unable to capitalize. Twenty minutes into the second half, Chen Zhenhe charged straight in from the left, advancing through several lines and reaching the warning zone. The divine soldiers were linked together, and there was no one at the Hong Kong goal. Heitan considered passing to the center, which would have been incredibly advantageous and easy to score. However, the central forward, Li, arrived and fumbled the opportunity. Chen Jiaqiu also watched it slip away. By the time Yutian regained possession, the enemy was already prepared. Unable to penetrate the goal, what a pity.</p>
<p>Jiaqiu's Header Leads to Fall of Hong Kong City</p>
<p>With only twelve minutes remaining in regulation time, Feng Yunyou took a free kick from 40 yards away from the enemy goal. The ball came back and forth, and he shot three times. The ball swirled around for a while. Li Yichen, blocked by Lau Mau, quickly passed to Heitan. Lau Mau rushed over to intercept again, but Heitan dodged and launched a powerful kick, sending the ball to the center. The right winger was waiting for the opportunity to strike. Chen Jiaqiu saw the ball coming and, at just the right moment, bent down and headed the ball. Boom! It hit the mark! The first goal was scored!</p>
<p>Mullen, Though Injured, The Iron Gate is Breached</p>
<p>The victory was already in the hands of the Chinese team. Hats flew into the air, and cheers erupted. It would have been difficult for the Hong Kong team to launch a sneak attack. In the next five minutes, the Hong Kong team put all its efforts into a counter-attack. Wong Mei-shun sent a pass to the center, and the injured general Mullen dribbled the ball straight up, breaking through the midfield line and reaching the front of the goal. While Zhou at the iron gate was stunned, Ma Mao launched a high ball, which went into the corner of the goal. The misunderstanding of offside resulted in a draw. After that, Heitan had one fierce shot, but it hit the wooden corner of the goal instead of going into the net. In a split second, the whistle blew, signaling a draw.</p>
<h3>Victory, Defeat, and the Situation</h3>
<p>Both Sides Were Cautious in Defense</p>
<p>Both sides were wary of the opponents' fierce attacks, so they were extremely cautious in defense. It was rare to see the central defenders rushing forward to push the attack, as they were focused on preventing the enemy forwards from maneuvering. Therefore, only the forwards of both sides were seen advancing and retreating, creating this kind of situation. The Chinese team paid particularly close attention to closely guarding both wings. This was the reason why it was difficult for both teams to make progress.</p>
<p>The Performance Was Extremely Exciting</p>
<p>Because both sides were very careful in their play, and wary of making mistakes, the whole game was exciting to watch. The Hong Kong goalkeeper and defenders were all excellent. On the Chinese team, Jiang Shanjing was particularly energetic. Zhou Xianmen and Li Ning also regained their original form. Among the forwards, Chen Yutian missed some opportunities in the first half, and Chen Hongguang did not perform particularly well, missing his shots several times.</p>
<h3>18,000 Spectators</h3>
<p>The Field Was Used as Seating</p>
<p>Because Hong Kong had recently lost to Shanghai, the crowd was particularly large for yesterday's match between Hong Kong and China. Because the baseball field did not have many seats, the YMCAspecially set up more than 400 seats inside the field for a special price of two yuan. Aristocrats and ladies flocked to the event, filling the seats. More than 2,400 one-yuan tickets were sold, but there were not enough seats for 2,000 people. As a result, the seats were packed, and many people stood around the edges. People then made their way onto the field and sat around the perimeter on the grass. The hexagonal stands were packed like mountains of people, with no room to move. A total of more than 14,000 tickets were sold. With the addition of complimentary tickets and friends, the number of people was probably around 18,000.</p>
<p>A New Record for the Baseball Field</p>
<p>As the saying goes, there are too many monks and not enough gruel to go around. Yesterday's baseball field was a case of too many people and not enough space. Normally, the baseball field seems large, but it was packed yesterday. Even if the baseball field were twice as large, it would not have seemed big enough. Many people who had purchased tickets were unable to enter the field, and there were still thousands outside. In the past, during the peak years of the Lehua Dragon Boat Race and the China-England and China-Soviet Union finals of the International Football Tournament, the baseball field was not as large as it is today, and the crowd was not as large as yesterday. The various strange situations on the field were truly beyond description. Although I would not dare to say that it was unprecedented, it was certainly an extraordinary occasion that had never been seen before.</p>
<p>The Association's Gate Was Overwhelmed, Ticket Offices Closed Due to Full Capacity</p>
<p>However, those who had pre-purchased tickets arrived a little late and found the gates closed. Unable to enter, they gathered at the YMCAs main gate. With a loud crash, the gate was knocked down. A police officer inside suffered a serious leg injury. A gatekeeper was also injured in the head. The spectators outside rushed in like a tide, and dozens of police officers were unable to stop them. A very fashionable young lady was knocked to the ground and cried out. Fortunately, she was not trampled, but her entire outfit was in disarray.</p>
<h3>Hospitality and Order for Today and Tomorrow</h3>

<p>Other Matches Still Being Arranged</p>
<p>Tonight, the Western Football Club will host a banquet at the International Sports Club. Tomorrow night, the National Sports Association will host one at the Great Eastern Hotel. The Hong Kong team's Western players will return south by boat on Wednesday. The Chinese team may stay for a few more days, and matches are still being arranged.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Women's Basketball Tournament: Le Yi Triumph Over the Women's Normal School and Hui Ling</h3>
<p>The sporting atmosphere among women in Suzhou has been quiet for a long time. Since the organization of women's basketball clubs in various girls' middle schools last year, intensive training has been carried out. This year, the basketball skills of various schools are quite impressive. The competition started last week, with a total of two games. The venues were both in the gymnasium of Yancheng Middle School. On the 22nd, Le Yi played against Hui Ling. Le Yi was originally a junior middle school, while Hui Ling was a high school that had won the Suzhou Women's Basketball Championship last year. The outcome was easy to predict. However, unexpectedly, Le Yi won with a score of 26 to 6, which shows how hard the school has worked on basketball. On the 24th, Le Yi, with its tired team, tested its skills against the famous Suzhou Women's Normal School in the province. The tactics were particularly impressive. In the first half, the Suzhou Women's Normal School won with a score of 7 to 9. In the second half, Le Yi fought back, ultimately turning defeat into victory with a score of 16 to 13, and returning in triumph. Le Yi's famous players, Huang Lianzhen and Qian Kunge, contributed the most. The former scored 17 points in the Le Yi vs. Hui Ling game, while the latter scored 11 points in the Le Yi vs. Suzhou game. The lineups for the Le Yi vs. Suzhou game are as follows:</p>

<h3>Max Xiang Bo's Sayings on Zhu Xi's "Feet"</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang talked about... decades ago, when he traveled to Xiamen, he personally saw that the women in that area kept their heels an inch or two off the ground, which was very strange. When he asked about it... the local gentry replied very formally... this was Zhu Xi's "feet," and they did not dare to change the ancient legacy! He then asked why Zhu Xi would care about this and design these "feet"? At that time, someone replied, in a scholarly tone... "To prevent lewdness!"</p>
<p>I talked about Wang Yangming's experimental method of teaching students to investigate things, which involved having them sit and observe a bamboo shoot growing for several days. Now, let's talk about Zhu Xi saying that lewdness cannot be prevented without feet, so he designed a set of rules that made movement difficult. One called for investigating things until you get a headache; the other prevented lewdness by restricting feet!</p>
<p>In fact, self-restraint is the key to becoming a sage; it is not about this or that! Please read on!</p>
<p>"What does lewdness look like? It is like water flowing out of a river... At first, one's face is still red with shame, but soon the mind is completely lost! Animals often point the way, and the gods watch the dark boudoir; it is better to be diligent in self-restraint, for chastity is a golden embankment."</p>
<p>This is a poem by Mo Jing titled "Chastity Restrains Lewdness." The Western sage, Erwo Lue, said: "Thinking deeply about the image of death and burial can best prevent evil thoughts!" This is a story from the Middle Ages!</p>
<p>"Once there was a monk who saw a beautiful woman dressed neatly; later, the image of her was always in his mind! Not long after, the beautiful woman died of illness and was buried before she was embalmed; foul water flowed everywhere; the monk saw this scene, soaked a handkerchief in the foul water, and kept it. Whenever evil thoughts were about to arise, he would smell the handkerchief and say to himself, 'The beautiful woman I saw the other day has reached this stage today!'"</p>
<p>The Book of Han records... When Lady Li was about to die, she did not want to see Emperor Wu of Han... Emperor Wu of Han only thought of her, and then he became suspicious!</p>
<h3>Anda's Four Anti-Japanese Heroes</h3>
<p>— Nankong</p>
<p>After the three northeastern provinces were occupied by the Japanese army, the people, unable to bear the Japanese army's trampling, rose up in resistance against Japan. Volunteer armies sprang up like mushrooms, each seeking the survival of the nation. The Japanese army found it difficult to cope and was exhausted, resulting in unprecedented chaos in the three northeastern provinces. Volunteer armies in various places repeatedly captured cities. The ferocity of the resistance war was truly rare. The Anda station was particularly fierce, having been captured and lost several times. The recent capture of the Anda station by Deng Wen's troops was due to the efforts of four anti-Japanese heroes. These four heroes were also members of Deng's volunteer army. Two were brothers surnamed Mu, one surnamed Zhang, and one named Liu Yunpeng. They were daredevils in Deng's army. Before Deng attacked the Anda station, he first sent secret agents to Anda to investigate the strength of the Japanese army. At that time, the Japanese army defending Anda numbered a full regiment, part of the 11th Division that invaded Shanghai. Deng's volunteer army numbered about 800, with 500 guns. Having heard that the Japanese army in Anda wanted to attack Baiquan and were being transferred to the front line, he took this opportunity to order the selection of 50 daredevils, all carrying grenades and armed with broadswords and pistols, to serve as the vanguard and attack Anda at night. The four heroes bravely volunteered for the daredevil team and, with the others, marched quickly at night. As they approached Anda, the Japanese army had already set up sentries in a village three miles from the station. The volunteer army moved forward like snakes and were spotted by the Japanese army, who shouted the password. The Zhang surnamed soldier leaped up and fired his pistol, and a Japanese soldier fell in response. The Japanese army behind them, hearing the sound, quickly sprayed gunfire. The Mu brothers, disregarding their own safety, threw grenades, and with a loud boom, smoke filled the air, killing many Japanese soldiers. Liu Yunpeng, behind them, shouted and waved his broadsword forward, killing a Japanese soldier. The Mu brothers and Zhang followed, and the crowd swarmed forward, directly attacking the Japanese formation. Deng immediately supervised his troops to advance. The Japanese army was greatly shocked and quickly sprayed machine gun fire. Zhang was hit in the arm, and blood poured down like a waterfall, but he ignored it.</p>
<h3>Research on Waste Utilization</h3>
<p>— Yue Min</p>
<p>Using newspapers to wrap things is not necessarily a way to utilize waste, but using it to wrap food seems wrong. I have seen that in the food stores along North Sichuan Road, especially those opened by Cantonese, almost nine out of ten use newspapers instead of wrapping paper for food items such as cakes, candies, snacks, marinated foods, and preserved meats. One day, I bought a bag of sponge cakes and, upon opening it, smelled a strong kerosene odor that made me want to vomit. It was also stained with black spots. In the end, I had no choice but to throw it into the trash because the ink on newspapers is made of a mixture of ink and kerosene. Leaving aside the fact that it's unappetizing, even if you force yourself to eat it, aren't you afraid of harming your health? I think that those who are responsible for local hygiene should strictly ban this practice.</p>
<p>Wielding his blade in fierce combat, Liu rolled forward on the ground with Zhang until they were only six or seven steps away from the machine gun. Liu threw a grenade at the Japanese army, and Zhang immediately tried to seize the machine gun with one arm, but unfortunately, he was shot in the chest by the Japanese army and died. The Mu brothers also pounced to Zhang's aid and seized the machine gun. The surprised Japanese army retreated, and the volunteer army shouted and pursued them, taking advantage of the momentum to capture the Anda station. Without the extraordinary courage of these four heroes, the success or failure of the entire operation would have been uncertain.</p>
<h3>Artification | Civilized Citizens Love Art |</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Now everything has to be "artified." Building houses has to be three-dimensional and "artified." Arranging rooms has to be simple and "artified." Tailoring clothes has to be fitted and "artified." Drawing advertisements has to be eye-catching and "artified." Shaping eyebrows has to be curved and "artified." Women's walking has to be swaying and "artified." Speaking has to be elegant and "artified." Writing has to be humorous and "artified." It is said that the civilization and barbarity of a country can be judged by whether its citizens love art. Anything that takes art as a prerequisite is considered a first-class civilized country.</p>
<p>It's not difficult. Let's try to "artify" everything. When eating, move your chopsticks rhythmically and continuously between the bowl and your mouth, preferably displaying the appearance of a wolf devouring its prey. This great behavior is "artified." If a husband and wife are at odds, don't just scold and cry; instead, use wooden sticks and kitchen knives to beat each other. Only when you've cracked heads, shed blood, and staggered back and forth is it "artified." Roads should not be paved flat, because that's too monotonous. They should be paved with high and low sections, so that cars bump up and down like electric chairs, and that can be considered "artified." Public and private clocks should be "artified." They should not all be the same; some should be fast and some should be slow, all different. Open-air pit latrines should be set up along the streets, and they should all be of different styles. That can also be considered "artified." Don't just shoot people; change to hanging. The facial expressions of the criminals after death, with their eyes wide and tongues sticking out, are most "artified." Don't cut your hair when it grows long, don't wash your face in the morning, don't brush your teeth, take a few puffs of opium, hunch your shoulders high, say a few words, and yawn. That can be completely "artified." When scolding someone, first roll up your sleeves, slap your thighs hard with both hands, then touch your fingers to the other person's face, and let saliva fly over their head. That is "artified" scolding.</p>
<p>If everything is "artified," perhaps we can also hold our heads high and be great citizens of a first-class civilized country.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Gold Market Advances</h3>
<p>Increase···Twenty-Three Taels Strong</p>
<p>New High Prices Are Constantly Emerging</p>
<p>Last week, the gold market's benchmark price experienced a prominent peak, with agile movements and frequent new records. Although there were no excessive disturbances, international news was turbulent, saying that the U.S. debt problem was brewing uncertainly, causing the gold market to be stormy and unpredictable, changing rapidly. The state of disarray was particularly unstoppable, with daily differences of five or six taels. In general, the exchange rate continued to fall without any end in sight, causing the Shanghai market to be greatly stimulated and prosperous, breaking through the 780 tael mark. The short sellers were severely hit and rushed to increase their positions. From the beginning of the week, the price rose and then fell again. The silver market, exchange rates, cotton, etc., all fell together. The opening was high, at 760 taels and 8 qian, an increase of 2 taels and 1 qian. Shortly after, foreign news mentioned a U.S. proposal for gold and silver protection, which dampened people's spirits, and finally the price reached 56 taels and 1 qian. Although the silver market did not fluctuate the next day, yesterday's expectations for a long position were not fulfilled. Exchange rates continued to fall, and there were rumors that the United States did not express sympathy and that war debts were postponed. Therefore, there were still many buyers, and the price briefly rose to the 60 tael mark. However, later, because the Central Bank swapped a large amount of forward exchange with the Cantonese banks (5,600 contracts), only advancing 6 taels, the market price was only calculated at 56 taels and 7 qian. However, bills of exchange were still good, and eventually increased by more than 5 taels. On Wednesday morning, the situation was the opposite of the 10th. Large contracts that looked short actually went long, so the opening was low. It was then reported that Italy had paid off a war debt of £1.4 million, and the price quickly broke through 60 taels again. At noon, news suddenly spread that U.S. President Hoover and newly elected President Roosevelt were meeting on the war debt issue, with hope for a possible extension. The gold price then shook again, showing a slight downstream trend. After this, the silver market and exchange rates declined continuously. Furthermore, Tung Tai Cheung and Kwong Yick Fung and others worked hard to cover their short positions, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten and regain its edge. The early market saw 67 taels and 8 qian. At noon, news suddenly spread that Morgan Company had borrowed a large sum of money to the British government for the purpose of repaying U.S. debts, and that someone in the United States had mentioned that it could be handled flexibly, using the currencies and stocks of various countries as collateral. This news spread throughout the market, and people's spirits suddenly weakened, falling to 62 and a half taels in the afternoon. On Friday, the exchange rate fell again, and individual contracts rose slightly. However, the American banks were closed for the holiday, and there was no fluctuation. However, the gold price was not affected at all. The opening was high, and then it was learned that the United States would not allow the currencies of various countries to be used to repay debts, and that U.S. dollars must be repaid as required. Market sentiment was widespread, and buyers showed courage. The price had already broken through the 70 tael mark in the afternoon, indicating that the silver market had shrunk slightly recently. However, private loans and futures trading at the Exchange actually increased by more than one cent, while exchange rates plummeted by more than four cents. Therefore, people in the gold market had a general sense of reaching the peak. The opening price flew up by 40 taels, and then short sellers rushed in, causing the foreign exchange market to become bustling, reaching a new high of 82 taels. It then closed at 81 taels and 9 qian. In summary, compared to the previous Saturday, it rose by 23 taels and 2 qian, and the high and low prices for the entire week differed by 25 taels and 9 qian. This week, the closing price was 21 taels and 1 qian higher than the opening price. It has risen for two consecutive weeks, totaling 43 taels strong. As for the overseas silver market, the U.S. market was flat and the British market shrank. The local exchange rate showed a decrease of 1.25 in the pound sterling and a decrease of 0.875 in the U.S. dollar. The actual transaction price of bank settlements showed a continued decrease of 1.25 in the pound sterling and a drastic decrease of 0.9375 in the U.S. dollar. This was due to the rise and fall of the exchange rate. At the beginning of the week, the pound sterling was stable, and the U.S. dollar was strong. Later, the U.S. dollar was particularly tight, breaking through 29 yuan. The pound sterling was slightly better. Since the beginning of the week, the Chinese gold industry has experienced inconsistent deposits and withdrawals. After Europe, they collected, in order to sell gold. The Ta Dah gang, Kwong Yick gang etc. also had short covering. Foreign exchange had a complete downturn with no days that did not see falls and no end in sight. Cumulatively, the British against the US continued to fall eight and eight-seven-five tenths of a cent, the US against the British cumulatively fell eight and four-three-seven-five tenths of a cent plus. Afterwards, it is feared that there will still be a downward trend, so short positions in gold have little chance of survival. By this week, December positions are trading against January positions, initially at six taels, and gradually decreasing. Before the end, the premium was two and a half taels, and now large households are generally trading out to balance their positions. The premium for the straight contract was initially sixteen or seventeen taels, and afterwards twelve and a half taels, due to the impact of reduced forward premiums. The total volume of January contracts is approximately 11,000 or more. Now a table of silver and exchange rates high and low prices follows:</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Last Week the Bond Market Was Strong with Prices Rising Vigorously</p>
<p>All Prices Increased by One Yuan Several Jiao to Three and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Transactions Reached Over 51.8 Million</p>
<p>During the past week (from November 21st to 26th), the futures market of the local Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was very active. The market was bustling, and all prices went up. Large households were trading in and out quite a bit, and forward and swap transactions were also active. According to the daily transaction situation in the past week, even on the last day of the week, when only the December contract was traded, the transaction volume reached several hundred ten thousand yuan. On Monday, it was over 6.3 million yuan, and on Friday, it was 8 million yuan. The other days were very prosperous, with each day reaching 10.067 million yuan. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 51.875 million yuan, exceeding the previous week by 22.275 million yuan. Consolidated salt tax was still the most, with 9.715 million yuan, divided into 2.805 million yuan for the November contract and 6.91 million yuan for the December contract. Consolidated tax was 8.41 million yuan, divided into 2.73 million yuan for the November contract and 5.68 million yuan for the December contract. The 1920 customs duties reduction and disarmament tariffs were second, with 2.43 million yuan for the November contract and 4.45 million yuan for the December contract for the 1920 tariff; 2.58 million yuan for the November contract and 4.26 million yuan for the December contract for the 1920 reduction tariffs; 1.845 million yuan for the November contract and 3.91 million yuan for the December contract for the disarmament tariffs; 2.17 million yuan for the November contract and 2.535 million yuan for the December contract for the 1920 tariff; 1.085 million yuan for the November contract and 2.595 million yuan for the December contract for the 1920 tax. The volume of border tariffs also far exceeded the previous week, with 1.85 million yuan for the November contract and 2.115 million yuan for the December contract. Customs duties totaled 975,000 yuan, and 6% bonds were at 850,000 yuan. However, only the November contract was traded for 96 financial bonds, with 75,000 yuan for 96 bonds and 25,000 yuan for financial bonds. The spot market was still stagnant, with only 108,600 yuan for the entire week, including approximately 20,000 yuan each for financial and 1920 customs bonds, and approximately 14,500 yuan each for consolidated salt tax reduction tariffs, with only several thousand yuan for the remainder. As for the changing situation, the current situation is generally good. Although the price market has not developed greatly, the overall sentiment in the market is extremely optimistic, and the market is in good spirits. Investors are buying more than in the previous week. Not only is retail buying very enthusiastic, but the attitude of large households is also good. Their purchasing power is strong, and with the approach of settlement, short sellers are forced to cover their positions, and the supply and demand situation is unbalanced. Prices have been rising continuously, and the pace of the increase has been unprecedented in recent times. The market has been rising steadily in the past week. The daily price fluctuations in the past week were relatively moderate, with only an increase of about 3 jiao. On Tuesday, prices increased by 5 or 6 jiao to 1.34 yuan. On Wednesday, the market was even better, with an increase of 6 or 7 jiao. On Thursday, reduction tariffs rose significantly, and other tariffs also increased further. On Friday, prices had mixed rises and falls. However, on the last day of the week, although the current month contract had passed the middle of the month, prices still rose significantly due to strong buying. Also, prices increased by 7 or 8 jiao to over 1 yuan. As a result, prices were much higher than the previous week, with each tariff generally increasing by 2 yuan several jiao to 3 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. Customs duties futures increased by over 1 yuan, and 7-year long-term consolidated bonds increased by 6 and a half yuan compared to late last month. The market has been stagnant at 6%, and the general sentiment in the market has definitely turned better. The overall situation has also shown a slight turnaround, and the rising trend of prices is an inevitable trend. However, the diplomatic situation is currently depressing, and excessive optimism is not warranted.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Last Week the Yarn Market Showed</p>
<p>Continuous Decline</p>
<p>丨Spot Sales are Equivalent to Despair 丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been weak and depressed for a week, but the decline has not been too sharp due to floor price concerns. Although the environment is harsh, new sellers are wary. However, the market is shrinking step by step, and demand is extremely sluggish. All parties have no intention of purchasing, mainly due to financial exhaustion and the ongoing civil war, which has led to a decline in commerce. As a result, yarn sales are considered hopeless, and northern cotton yarn continues to arrive in Shanghai for competitive sales, which has led to an increase in the inventories of various factories. The daily sales volume is at most between 500 and 600 bales. Under these circumstances, how can the yarn market be sustained? Most people are psychologically inclined to sell short and watch the decline. Although the long positions of the Wing On Factory are struggling hard, the trend is such that the downward trend cannot be reversed. They have slightly reduced their long positions midway, so the price has recently broken through the 40 tael mark. Currently, due to the difficulty in obtaining cotton and the shortage of supplies, the market is relatively firm. Yarn used for cotton towels and bedding has less sales. The future situation is not optimistic. The total purchases by various gangs for the entire week were only 2,085 bales. The market price has fallen by about 1 tael. Standard yarn has recently fallen by 1 tael, while Liaoning yarn has risen by 0.25 tael. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 153,450 bales. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>

<p>Last Week the Cotton Market Was Relatively Stable</p>
<p>丨Not Assimilated by the Downturn in the World Cotton Industry 丨</p>
<p>Due to Scarcity and Depleted Spot Supplies</p>
<p>Although the cotton market has been extremely high-spirited for a week, it is naturally possible to decline in this downturn in the world cotton industry. In addition to the manufacturer’s vigorous sale of 200,000 bales, this amount accounts for three-quarters of the market, and the force can be described as strong. However, the market is still difficult to fall, because farmers in all directions are unwilling to sell cheaply, and the number of supplies from various sources is small, resulting in the Shanghai money stores having weakly low storage. As for the American market, it has fallen back to 5.78 points, but the shrinking US exchange rates makes it difficult to calculate for those purchasing to sell silver. The Indian market is also the same. The supplies that arrived successively last month have little accumulated in storage, so there is this reason. Merchants still maintain a slow, quiet, and steady attitude. In short, there is too little spot, resulting in a tight cotton and weak yarn situation. According to the Indian market report, the situation is good, and if Indian cotton purchases can go smoothly in the future, this local cotton may have a drastic change, otherwise it will be difficult for general cotton to decline greatly. According to the source on the dock, there are 2,072 bales of Yao cotton and 12,793 bales of short cotton. The total transaction volume of standard cotton for the whole week was 442,800 bales. The price of standard cotton for each month fell by 5 fen to 1 qian compared to the previous week, and the price of American cotton fell by 25 pounds.

<p>Foreign Cotton Fell More Than It Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially firm due to a lack of sellers and good news from Liverpool. Later, it became weak due to the downturn in Wall Street. Futures fell by one to five pounds, and spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures rose by three points, and spot prices fell by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by seven points. The Indian cotton market was firm and stable, with Pingguoer falling by three rupees, Aomula falling by 2.75 rupees, and Bailuoquan falling by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 26th).</p>

<p>North-South Goods Longkou Vermicelli Sales are Sluggish but the Market is Stable</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli and dried vermicelli have recently been selling slowly, and the market is flat. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Zhangzhou round ship transported a batch, totaling 500 to 600 bales, which has not yet been released. The current market price is 19 taels for Longkou vermicelli according to northern standards, 15 taels for Yanli vermicelli, and 18 taels and 5 qian for Longkou goods according to southern standards. Only the local street gang Xing is selling, but according to local prices, it is 0.2456 yuan, and there is no definite date for the arrival of goods, so the market seems to be stable.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Death ㈡㈩㈦</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>Gengsheng naturally agreed and followed her into the elevator to room 436. He had no time to examine the room's furnishings at this point, eager to hear her story. There was no need to dwell on matters of love either, as he suspected something important was about to happen.</p>
<p>Ai wrung her hands, raised her face, and said, "Oh heavens! How is it that I still see you?" Gengsheng said, "I saw you in the elevator during the day, but I didn't dare ask because I was so bewildered by your fashionable appearance at the time that I couldn't firmly believe it was you." Ai clapped her hands and said, "That's right! I thought so too. I saw two small holes under your left ear. That's your mark, your unique feature. People from Jiangbei and other places often have their ears pierced at the behest of their parents and wear earrings, which is very, very common. But I know that back then, one hole wasn't pierced through, so they pierced a second one, resulting in two holes existing side by side. That's unique to you."</p>
<p>"Ah! So, you were looking closely at me, not at my name tag."</p>
<p>"Spare the small talk. I have something important to discuss with you."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"These past few days, I've been pestered to death by someone, and this person is my enemy. It's ridiculous that he doesn't recognize me, and he's courting me. I think simply rejecting him would be too easy on him. Is there a good way to deal with him?"</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It's Han Muliang, who used 'one hundred and fifty dollars' to buy your lifelong companion!"</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Originally, I didn't recognize him because he used to be a minor official in the XX department, and he had a small mustache. Also, he's so haggard and much thinner than before. Later, he revealed his real name to me and told a big lie, saying, 'I'm not married yet.'"</p>
<p>Gengsheng chuckled. Aili also laughed and said, "He even boasted to me about the sincerity and exclusivity of his love, saying he drove away a concubine who hadn't done anything wrong. And that's supposed to be sincere and exclusive? Men are truly experts at lying!"</p>
<p>"He would never have imagined that the woman he now loves is the same one he previously rejected." Gengsheng rested his elbows on his knees, supporting his chin with his hands, looking up slightly, staring directly at Aili. Aili offered him a cigarette, but Gengsheng shook his head. Aili lit one for herself, putting it in a very thin and long cigarette holder, the cigarette and holder together measuring a full six inches. She pursed her lips, compressing the tobacco into a thin line, and slowly, artistically, blew out the smoke. Gengsheng felt like he was in a movie theater, watching a Hollywood female star performing. He couldn't help but say, "No wonder that thief is confused and can't recognize you. Even I, if I didn't notice the mole on your left forehead, wouldn't have the slightest suspicion. Look at yourself in the mirror. Where is the image of the former Aigu?" Aili said, "Indeed! I've become a different person. Honestly, I've become one of the most despicable and dangerous women in society. I'm even thinking of doing something even more dangerous to teach a lesson to those so-called young masters who only use banknotes to buy flesh." After saying this, she angrily threw the half-smoked cigarette out the window, not caring what was outside. She was extremely indignant and didn't care about anything. Gengsheng, at a loss, couldn't think of the right words to comfort or dissuade her. He could only force a smile, nod, sigh, and try to soothe her with a mix of responses.</p>
<p>Later, Aili asked Gengsheng how he became a soldier. Gengsheng said, "What's there to say about being a soldier who fights against our own people? Now we're fighting against foreigners, but I'm still not willing to do it. There's really no food to eat, and I'm not willing to be a bandit, so I'm forced down this path." Aili raised her thumb and said, "This time, your XX Route Army's more than twenty days of hard fighting can be compared to 'Qi Jiguang fighting the Eastern Barbarians.'"</p>
<p>Gengsheng couldn't help but laugh and said, "Have you seen that play?" Aili nodded, and after a brief silence of three minutes, she suddenly stood up, sat down next to Gengsheng, turned her head, and asked, "Do you need money? My heart is willing to give it to you, but my body is no longer able to."</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand! You might think I'm a dancing star, so I can't give it to you. Think about the past few years. You used to walk under the chastity arch in our Cuiwei Village. Then you'll understand it's 'cannot,' not 'unwilling.'"</p>
<p>"So, what are you planning to do?"</p>
<p>Aili brought her mouth close to Gengsheng's ear and spoke for a long, long time. This reunion scene came to a close.</p>

<p>Interbank Rate Drops, Call Loan Rate Rises, Market Consolidates</p>
<p>Copper Coins Suddenly Exceed 4000 Cash per Dollar Again</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Quiet, Taels Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was weak due to the routine weekly bank holiday, which traditionally subdues activity in the financial and trading sectors. The interbank rate, which had recently been strong due to exports, suddenly eased. The market interbank rate was 7 yuan 1 fen 2 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half in the morning session, and 7 yuan 1 fen 2 li 7 hao and a half in the afternoon session, a slight decrease of 3 hao 7 hu and a half compared to the previous day's afternoon session. Overall, the market consolidated within a relatively narrow range. Outward remittances totaled 85,000 yuan in the morning session and only 175,000 yuan in the afternoon session, a significant drop from normal levels. Money shops cleared over 4.3 million yuan in foreign currency, while small money shops traded over 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Call Loan High, No Clearing</p>
<p>Yesterday, no clearing occurred at the banks, resulting in quiet silver tael inflows and outflows. Silver liquidity has been tight for some time. Although rates tightened slightly yesterday, ample funds are expected to be released later, suggesting that the tightening trend will likely continue. The call loan rate was 6% in both the morning and afternoon sessions, an improvement of 2% compared to the previous day. Bill trading, ledger settlements, and new transactions totaled 5.45 million yuan in the morning session and 890,000 yuan in the afternoon and Small General Assembly sessions. Money shops and silver firms cleared over 19 million yuan, a decrease of over 10 million yuan compared to previous days.</p>
<p>Copper Coins Exceed Milestone</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Jiangnan small silver coins suddenly fell slightly by 4 li, to 6 yuan 1 fen 5 li. They rebounded by 1 li in the afternoon session, reaching 6 yuan 1 fen 6 li. Trading volume was 5,000 corners in the morning session and 3,000 corners in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 6 yuan 1 fen 4 li 2 hao and a half in the morning session and 6 yuan 1 fen 4 li 7 hao and a half in the afternoon session. Trading volume was 75,000 corners in the morning session and 25,000 corners in the afternoon session. Due to a large influx, copper coins rose again by 5,000 cash, exceeding the 400,000 cash milestone, reaching 403,000 cash. Various exchange rates were posted at tens of cash, it was said.</p>
<h3>Zheng Xiaoxu is Old and Not Dying</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>"Zheng Xiaoxu is old and not dying" - this isn't my curse, it's Puyi's wife, Rongshi, who said it. Being old and not dying doesn't necessarily make someone a thief, but Zheng Xiaoxu certainly is a thief, a traitor to the nation. Calling him old and not dying is truly fitting.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu, like "an old lord blowing on a clay pot," dreams of restoration, urging Puyi to become a puppet for the Japanese, defying the great disapproval of the world. As a result, Puyi says, "How can I be considered a puppet? I am a prisoner." Since Puyi's rise as a puppet, his actions have been entirely restricted, and everything is monitored by the Japanese. Even in conversation, he must be extremely cautious, not daring to offend the Japanese even slightly, or he will be invited by the monitors to "eat a big meal." This is the evil consequence created by Zheng Xiaoxu and his gang of foxes and dogs.</p>
<p>Now, Zheng Xiaoxu is once again fantasizing, wanting to "pimp" for Puyi, urging Puyi to take a concubine, and even a Japanese concubine. Truly, he is a shameless person who should die a quick death. Since Wenxiu left, Puyi inevitably feels somewhat lonely. Zheng seizes this opportunity to persuade Puyi to take a Japanese woman as a concubine, both to ingratiate himself with Puyi and to express goodwill toward the Japanese. It's truly a plan with two benefits. However, since Puyi became a prisoner, his every word and action has been monitored by the Japanese. Yet, the bedroom is perhaps a place where surveillance is inconvenient. While it's nominally for Puyi to take a concubine, it's effectively placing a female monitor in the room. Puyi truly has no way out.</p>
<p>I recall that when Puyi was young, they planned to hire a foreign nanny. The Japanese authorities, upon hearing this, immediately convened an imperial conference, recommending the daughter of a certain duke. One of the famous three traitors of the country introduced her, attaching three conditions: first, she must have freedom of movement throughout the palace; second, the term must be twenty years; and third, she must have complete secrecy over her correspondence. Therefore, our national secrets were all known to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Assuming that taking a concubine becomes a reality, then Puyi will be connected to Japanese women throughout his life. He will be inseparable from the nanny in the beginning and then from the Japanese concubine. This is truly Puyi's misfortune and the root of the nation's troubles.</p>

<h3>Year-End Reflections</h3>
<p>— Chen Baoren</p>
<p>Frost and snow at the edge of the world, my dreams are uneasy;</p>
<p>A fur coat is helpless against the cold.</p>
<p>The hardships of the world make poetry a poor medicine for my troubles,</p>
<p>And sorrow and illness keep me awake at night.</p>
<p>A fluttering kerchief startles the migrating geese,</p>
<p>Deep feelings in letters reveal the difficulties of life.</p>

<h3>Leaning on the Balcony</h3>
<p>— Previous author</p>
<p>Who knows me at the edge of the world, a friend in need?</p>
<p>With hatred, I gaze at the setting sun, leaning on the balcony.</p>
<p>How many tears do I shed for the yellow chrysanthemums?</p>
<p>The sound of the new washing block mingles with the autumn wind from the north.</p>

<h3>Methods for Cleaning Accumulated Dirt on Utensils</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>The author previously wrote an article exclusively discussing methods for removing stains on clothing. Now, I will compile and describe methods for removing accumulated dirt on utensils, to supplement the previous article's shortcomings.</p>
<p>(1) Accumulated Dirt on Lacquerware: Lacquerware refers to wooden objects coated with lacquer. When lacquerware has accumulated stains, use a velvet or soft cloth dipped in a mixture of equal parts ammonia water and alcohol to gently wipe it, and it will be as shiny as new. Another method is to use a slice of lemon to wipe the lacquered surface, then wash it with soap and cold water.</p>
<p>(2) Accumulated Dirt on Imitation Lacquerware: Imitation lacquer is also called "Western lacquer," and its scientific name is "varnish." It changes color when exposed to heat, so when imitation lacquer has stains, do not wash it with hot water. Use cold tea or milk to wipe it. Another method is to add a little vinegar to cold water, dip a soft cloth in it, and wipe it. This is also effective.</p>
<p>(3) Accumulated Dirt on Enamelware: You can use loofah or a hairball coated with soap to scrub it, then rinse it with clean water. Another method is to wash it with a dilute solution of vinegar and water. Another method is to brush it with turpentine, which can also clean it thoroughly.</p>
<p>(4) Accumulated Dirt on Pottery: Wash it with soapy water, or rub it with salt, or wipe it with fine ash mixed with vinegar, or use a cloth dipped in turpentine. When washing dishes, add a slice of lemon peel to the water to remove any fishy, oniony, or other residual odors, and to make the porcelain surface shiny.</p>
<p>(5) Accumulated Dirt on Glassware: First wash it with soapy water, then rinse it with clean water. If you add a little vinegar to the water, it can make the glass shiny and clear. You can use salt or ash to rub glass cups and dishes. To wash glass bottles, fill the bottle halfway with water, add tea leaves or mustard, and shake it. Then rinse it with clean water. To wipe glass windows, add ammonia water to warm water, dip a cloth in it, and wipe it. Another method is to mix lead powder with water and apply it to the glass window. When it dries, wipe it with a dry cloth. To wash smoky lampshades, add a little vinegar and salt to warm water, immerse the lampshade in it, and wait for the soot to float away. Then wipe it clean with parchment paper or other thin paper.</p>
<p>(6) Accumulated Dirt on Stainless Steel: For dirt and grease on stainless steel, wash it with hot soapy water, salt water, or lye, then rinse it with clean water.</p>
<p>(7) Accumulated Dirt on Gold: Goldware often becomes dull after prolonged use. You can use a cloth dipped in alcohol to wipe it, then use chamois leather to rub it, or use extremely fine fire-refined gold powder to rub it. All of these methods can make it look like new.</p>
<p>(8) Accumulated Dirt on Silver: Silverware also easily becomes dirty and cloudy after prolonged use. To refresh it, in addition to using silver polish, you can use fragrant powder to rub it, or use a cloth dipped in dilute nitric acid to wipe it. Another method is to dissolve calcium hypochlorite in water, stirring it until it dissolves, and then use a soft cloth dipped in this liquid to wipe it.</p>
<p>(9) Accumulated Dirt on Copper: Copperware develops green rust after prolonged use. To remove it, first place the copperware in hot soapy water and wash it, then rub it with copper polish. Another method is to place the copperware in vinegar, soak it for a day, take it out, and then rub it with tin foil ash. You can use a cloth coated with wax to wipe brassware, and then use a clean soft cloth to polish it. You can use incense ash or tile powder to polish cupronickel items. When red copper turns black, you can use ferric chloride applied to a cloth to wipe it, then wash it with lemon juice.</p>
<p>(10) Accumulated Dirt on Iron: For rust on ironware, use sandpaper or fine sand to rub it, or use a brick with water to grind it. After wiping it dry, apply vegetable oil to it. For grease on pots and pans, you can</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>wash them with hot alkaline water or lye to remove it. After cooking fishy or meaty foods, fill the pot with water, add two spoonfuls of vinegar, and boil it to eliminate the residual fishy or meaty odor.</p>
<p>(11) Accumulated Dirt on Tinware: Accumulated dirt on tinware is actually tin oxide. To remove it, first place the tinware in salt water or soapy water to soak and wash it, take it out and wipe it dry, and then rub it with incense ash.</p>
<p>(12) For hot water bottles and other rubber products that have accumulated dirt, you can wash them with soda (i.e., sodium carbonate) water or ammonia water.</p>
<p>(13) For accumulated dirt on amber beads and other ornaments,</p>
<p>it is advisable to wash them with milk.</p>
<p>(14) To remove dirt on an iron, you can use the following method: place a piece of beeswax between two pieces of velvet cloth, and while the iron is hot, rub it on the velvet cloth, and the dirt will be removed immediately.</p>
<p>(15) To remove ink pad buildup on seals, you can use an old toothbrush, borax, or gasoline to scrub it.</p>
<p>(16) Washing Sponges: First, put the sponge in cold water and soak it for a moment, take it out and squeeze it dry, then put it in water with lemon juice and soak and wash it, and finally rinse it with clean water.</p>
<p>(17) When suede gloves get dirty, soak a velvet cloth in milk, wring it out, and wipe the gloves with it to remove the dirt. You can also purchase soap specifically for washing leather gloves from the market.</p>
<h3>How Are the Martyrs Now?</h3>
<p>— Na Fu</p>
<p>The hands of the martyrs, the lovely hands of the martyrs!</p>
<p>If you inadvertently saw the hand of a martyr, it would surely make your hair stand on end, your blood boil with tension, or even excite you more. Because a human hand placed in a glass bottle, displaying grayish-white skin, with the outer layer of skin turned into fish-scale-like wrinkles, a three-inch-wide hole from a bullet wound on the left side of the palm, flowing out with handfuls of grayish-black meat fibers and a clump of reddish-black bones, obviously showing signs of being severed by a knife. At the same time, the five fingers pointing high to the sky express a kind of bravery. If you suddenly saw it, it would truly make you both grieved, fearful, and excited!</p>
<p>It is said that this hand is a souvenir left by a martyr who died in the "January 28th Incident" last year. In addition to this hand, there is also an equally lovely foot. There are also several huge bullets, one of which can hold 200 pounds of explosives inside, weighing a total of 600 pounds. The rest of the bullets are slightly smaller.</p>
<p>The things mentioned above are all war trophies from the "January 28th Incident" in Shanghai last year, and they are currently displayed in the Municipal Public Education Center. When I visited these items, I felt that it was very appropriate for them to be displayed here. First, it can commemorate our past resistance achievements and express our spirit of revival. Secondly, it can allow our people to constantly experience the gifts given to us by the brutal Japanese and the lessons of past suffering.</p>
<p>However, the anniversary of the "January 28th Incident" is approaching. Are the sacrificed martyrs rejoicing or grieving in the underworld? Do those of us who are still alive know?</p>
<h3>Mailed to Mother</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Mother...I have not received a letter from home for three months, and your son can only hope for the peace of the whole family! Who knew that I would suddenly receive a letter from my elder brother saying that your illness has worsened, that you have not left your room for three months, and that you have not left your bed for more than a month, wailing in pain all day and unable to sleep all night? The doctors are helpless and have no remedy. Is this my elder brother's deliberate attempt to exaggerate? It truly makes your son read it with tears flowing and release it with sorrow. I don't know where the sadness comes from, and when it will end!</p>
<p>Your illness began last spring and has lasted for nearly two years. The doctors say that the source of the illness is excessive labor and that it is caused by a weak constitution. This is because, for sixty years, you have given birth to children, raised grandchildren, and managed household affairs, never resting for a single day. Moreover, because we, your children, are unworthy, the family fortune has declined. Father sees this and is worried and resentful, often venting his anger on you. The mental depression is especially severe! However, you have never blamed us, your children. On the contrary, you have always cherished us like the apples of your eye, granting our every request. In the past, my elder brother was tempted by the environment and indulged in gambling. He lost tens of dollars and had no way to return home. When you heard about it, you immediately gathered money and asked someone to lead him back. My third brother liked to drink alcohol, but Father would not allow it. You would always secretly give him drinks. When I first started school, every time I came home, Father only gave me a small amount of pocket money. I was afraid of his strictness and dared not ask for more. I secretly asked you, and you always gave me the full amount. If my sister-in-law was not obedient or the sisters-in-law were not harmonious, you would try to persuade them with kind words, and the matter would be resolved. Father and you were concerned that the annual income was not enough to cover our expenses, so you often scolded beggars and vagrants. But you always borrowed money to help them, and those who received the help were grateful and praised you. When Father heard about it, he would scold you again, making you unable to rest. But you always remained the same, never changing. This is all due to your loyalty and kindness! Now that your son thinks about this, I can't help but feel deeply moved, and tears fall silently!</p>
<p>You were born into a farming family and grew up in the countryside. You married Father at a young age and have been busy every day ever since, never having studied poetry or books. However, you have always followed the traditional moral principles of our country, serving your parents-in-law with filial piety, treating your father with respect, teaching your children with kindness, and treating others with harmony. I have never heard of you making a mistake. Only because of this, you have given little guidance on our future. However, since I have become aware of human affairs, I have deeply felt the influence of your diligence, thrift, and kindness. I know how to cultivate myself and study, and I know that human beings originally valued mutual assistance. This is not only true at home. From now on, I will certainly uphold this principle and work harder to live up to your expectations!</p>
<p>When I entered the world, it was at a time of political change. For more than ten years, I have been influenced by the education I have received. I also feel the disharmony between my elder brothers and sisters-in-law. Therefore, I once requested that my marriage should be based on my own choice. You heard this and agreed without any objections. This shows that you are able to see the trends and do not want to lose my heart. It also shows that you are not as stubborn as others. As a result, although I grew up in an old family, I was able to escape the pain of old marriages and have the freedom and happiness I have today.</p>
<p>In the spring of the seventeenth year, my grandfather died and was buried. You worked tirelessly to manage the affairs, and at that time, you were still as healthy as ever, only occasionally losing your appetite. On February 1st, I bid farewell and came to Shanghai to study. In the autumn, I fell seriously ill. You consulted fortune tellers and gods at home, sought doctors and prescriptions, and asked my elder brother to write a letter detailing everything. Although this superstition was ineffective, it also showed your deep love for your son! Last summer in June, I took leave to return home. When I arrived home, you were lying in bed. When I asked the family, they did not tell me. When I opened the curtain and looked at you, I was shocked by your emaciated appearance, as thin as wood. At that time, you still did not easily reveal the truth, because you were afraid that I would drop out of school because of it! Before I returned to Shanghai, you vaguely revealed the pain of your illness, urging me to return early. At that time, I thought that your illness had gradually improved, so I was relieved and said goodbye again. This summer in April, I returned to Changsha and went home, but I was again involved in human affairs and left after only eight days. The doctors said that the illness was difficult to cure suddenly, but it was not critical. Who knew that it would turn critical in an instant!</p>
<p>My elder brother's letter said, "If you can return early, there is still a chance to see each other. If the Queen Mother of the West summons her, I will telegraph you immediately." Mother, how can your son not want to return early and throw myself into your arms? But I am adrift, with only the clear breeze in my sleeves. Where can I borrow such a large amount of travel expenses? Your son can only look up to the sky and pray, waiting until the end of the year. If the Queen Mother of the West does summon her, Mother, your son can only shed tears into the Huangpu River, hoping that it can flow upstream to the banks of the Xiang River and turn into rain to fall on your grave!</p>
<p>Mother, people die in Shanghai every day. In the past, I was indifferent to funerals. But recently, due to the situation, I become saddened at the sight of one. Mother, your son is truly afraid of the terror of "death"!</p>
<p>In this era, life has no meaning, and death is inevitable since ancient times. But because you have worked hard all your life, never resting, and have not received any material enjoyment, how can this not make your son sad and cry out loud!</p>
<p>Your son has never served by your side like the old Laizi, inquiring after your well-being morning and night, or performed for your entertainment. Nor can I write like Bing Xin to leave a memorial. Drifting aimlessly, I am truly unable to put your heart at ease even a little! Thinking of this, I feel deeply guilty! Now, I can only sincerely pray that your years will be prolonged, giving your son one last chance to see you. Mother, my heart is broken! I can only sincerely pray!</p>
<h3>Edge</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Outside the pass, icy sky, biting wind, red blood, white blades, flesh and blood intertwined; the mournful sound of the Hu Jia, the long neighs of warhorses, in the deathly mountains, on the iron-like riverbank, raise the flag of the nation, with the remaining guns and bullets, the surging hot blood, to recover the shattered mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Shanghai, warm, mysterious, enticing with wine and women; jazz, Citroens, leisurely enjoyment... ignoring day and night... wild embraces on the dance floor, passionate kisses on the screen, everything covered with a gray net, creating a trap of depravity.</p>
<p>The sensational four-corner love movie, showing simultaneously in two theaters, not over at seven o'clock, the nine o'clock audience pushing forward, afraid of falling behind.</p>
<p>In the public column for donating to the Northeast Volunteer Army... "Saving the two copper coins Mom gives me every day, accumulated for two months, offering four corners worth of stamps"; "Sending one yuan for shoes and socks, apprentice XX from XX store"; patriots who dare not fall behind in action.</p>
<p>Citroen, multicolored strange clothes, high heels, affected poses, "Miss, is there anything better?" Pushing aside the socks priced at twenty-five yuan.</p>
<p>Steward, ragged clothes, broken hat, torn shoes, fearful soft voice, "Boss, do a good deed, give me a copper coin to buy congee," he follows behind the gentleman in the Western suit.</p>
<h3>Street Promenade</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Deceived by life, I am often on the road. Moved by various feelings, I hastily compose this piece.</p>
<p>(1) Chinese People's Time</p>
<p>Chinese people's time doesn't count for anything. I once counted from Shunxing Clothing Store at the intersection of Fourth Road and Zhejiang Road to Sino-French Pharmacy at the intersection of Shandong Road. Among the seventy-nine clocks, no two showed the same time. The difference ranged from several minutes to more than an hour. Foreigners say Chinese people are like a plate of loose sand. Unexpectedly, Chinese clocks also suffer from this ailment.</p>
<p>(2) Unwritten Constitution</p>
<p>Urinating in alleys is an unwritten constitution. The notice "Urinating Prohibited" is actually equivalent to a "Urinating Allowed" advertisement. Many people find convenience under the implication of this notice.</p>
<p>(3) When China Will Be Strong</p>
<p>When you walk into a small alley, you often step on something under your feet, and that is the residue of medicine. People think it is unlucky to step on medicine residue, as if bringing the illness with them. This has the same wonderful effect as the "Selling Colds" signs on electric poles. Someone asked me when China will be strong? I said, when there is no medicine residue on the streets.</p>
<p>(4) A Scene from the Capital War</p>
<p>Phonographs, gongs and drums, the smell of charcoal, deafening shouts. On every street, there are seventeen or eighteen vendors selling sugar-roasted chestnuts, a scene of the capital war in this world's economic depression.</p>
<p>(5) No Law is Greater Than Police Regulations</p>
<p>Once, I walked along Avenue Edward VII. A rickshaw puller, impatient and disregarding the police officer's baton, rushed across the road. The police officer was furious and tore down his license. The rickshaw puller knelt and begged, but to no avail. As a result, he was led away "into the alley" like a tamed sheep. I was horrified when I saw this. I felt that no law is greater than police regulations, with absolutely no leniency. Look, the League of Nations Covenant cannot deal with Japan, the army, navy, and air force criminal law cannot resolve the civil war, but the police regulations must be strictly obeyed. "The police are truly worthy of admiration," I thought.</p>
<p>(6) The Degree of Sympathy</p>
<p>A big fire burns, watched from across the river; a rickshaw overturns, laughed at with applause. Such is the extent of Chinese people's sympathy!</p>
<p>(7) It's a Pity Her Nose Isn't Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, I walked past Jing'an Temple Road and encountered two women in front of the Great Shanghai (department store). High-heeled shoes, knee-length dresses, fox fur scarves, felt hats, full of foreign airs, clearly overseas misses. Looking closer, it was a pity their eyes weren't green and their noses weren't higher. Yellow skin and black eyes, truly completely domestically produced. Using silver to imitate countries using gold, I grieve for their fathers, brothers, and husbands!</p>
<p>(8) Shanghai Civilization</p>
<p>Shanghai is a two-thousand-year-old historical museum, a bizarre stage of the twentieth century. Look on the streets, small cars and motorcycles fly side by side, temples and dance halls stand in parallel. When you walk on the street, you feel like you've stepped into a historical museum or watched a historical film. How magnificent! Is this why it's called the Paris of the East?</p>
<p>(9) The Classes of Humanity</p>
<p>There's the difference between the rich living on the twenty-second floor and the temporary concubine sleeping on the cement floor.</p>
<p>At every bridgehead, there are many day laborers waiting. When a rickshaw passes, they help pull it up. From the bottom of the bridge to the top, a copper coin is the price. "Rickshaw pullers must be the lowest class of humanity?" I often think. Yet there are still those who wish to be rickshaw pullers but cannot. Alas! The classes of humanity!

<p>Film Special</p>
<p>New Film Introductions</p>
<h3>The "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger" at the Nanjing Grand Theater</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>RKO's colossal beast film, "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger," will likely be released this Thursday at the Nanjing Grand Theater. This hunting film isn't as long as "Human Beasts Wonders" and the plot isn't as complex, but it can stand on its own, creating its own unique style, and possesses characteristics that "Human Beasts Wonders" can't match. Its most outstanding feature is the mutual killing and fighting between tigers, leopards, snakes, rhinos, bulls, elephants, etc. Watching these scenes is breathtaking, and surely many timid people won't dare to watch, or will be frightened, have trouble sleeping at night, have nightmares, etc. Aftereffecto If you don't believe me, let me tell you a story, and you'll believe me;</p>
<p>After RKO produced "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger," Fox also wanted to release a hunting film, reportedly titled "Man Eater." They hired Clive Elliott, the director of "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger," to direct this new film. They also hired a very famous leading actor, whose name, of course, hasn't been announced, and I naturally have no way of knowing. This actor, hearing that he was invited to be the lead in a colossal film and would be traveling to Africa (the film was to be shot in Sumatra), was filled with excitement and readily agreed to a one-year contract without thinking. After signing the contract, he happily went to a cinema to watch a film, and coincidentally, he watched the very film we're about to see, "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger." He was completely terrified from beginning to end. He thought, going to Africa to film wild animals isn't human life. The more he thought, the more frightened he became, and he probably didn't sleep all night. The next morning, he got up and went to the Fox office, waiting for the manager to arrive. Why? Because he said, "I'm not going to Africa. I want to cancel the contract I signed yesterday!"</p>
<p>This film is a meticulously crafted masterpiece by Frank Buck, filmed in the Malay Archipelago. Every foot of it was filmed in Malaya. The most intense part is the snake-tiger fight. A huge, spotted tiger is trapped by a python several feet long, struggling to break free, but the python is also exhausted, and both are eventually captured. Furthermore, the techniques for capturing ferocious beasts and poisonous snakes are incredibly ingenious. If you insist on seeing Wu Song fighting the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, then I won't say anything, but otherwise, "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger" is worth seeing. Also, before seeing this film, I felt that the name was too vulgar, but after seeing it, I felt that the name was extremely appropriate, because the earth-shattering battle between the giant python and the spotted tiger truly deserves the name "Fight of the Dragon and Tiger." But the English title is Bring Em Back Alive. If it were translated as "Capture Alive," wouldn't it be more accurate and less vulgar? I'd like to ask Mr. Lu Shibai what he thinks?</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>A Discussion of "New Firefighting Techniques"</h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>As soon as you see "New Firefighting Techniques" (Fireman, Save My Child) or the Carlton advertisement, you know it's a humorous comedy.</p>
<p>The story is: A baseball star is passionate about firefighting. He often neglects the game because he is too careful and too involved in firefighting. However, in order to marry a girl, he has to give up his job in the fire department and become a baseball player. At the same time, he develops a fast-acting firefighting chemical, achieving both fame and fortune. The team wins the game and he returns triumphantly, marrying her.</p>
<p>The plot is similar to Luke's "Football King" from ten years ago, and the content is comparable to Jack O'Kay's "Silly Football King." Like "Silly Football King," there's a baseball game. In particular, Joe E. Brown, who plays the "firefighting fanatic," his style, actions, and even appearance resemble Jack O'Kay. The plain banana-eating and ball-throwing are all amusing. He is indeed a comedic genius. Evalyn Knapp does a good job. The small subplot of a love triangle gives her room to develop, which is, of course, also the director's ability. The rest of the cast are good supporting characters in this comedy.</p>
<p>If you walk past the Carlton Theater and hear constant laughter, it's all thanks to Brown.</p>
<h3>An Hanting's Nationality Problem</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>An Hanting now has seven cities requesting her to become a citizen. Because her father is a distinguished military officer, often stationed in various places without a fixed residence. If she were to become a citizen of any city, that place would be proud of it.</p>
<h3>"Awakening People and the World"!</h3>
<p>— Bozhang</p>
<p>Chinese films now, besides romance films and martial arts films, rarely have films that "awaken people and the world"! Apart from one film, "Humanity," there are almost none!</p>
<p>Now we hope that major Chinese film companies will focus their efforts on making more films that "awaken people and the world"! Because if we want to improve Chinese society and the psychology of the people now, I think using films is the best method. Now, slogans have become numb! Lectures are useless! Only films can be screened year after year, and the influence of films on people's psychology is significant, and it is done unconsciously.</p>
<p>However, I also know that it is difficult to gather materials for films that "awaken people and the world," but if you add a bit of romance, it will cater to the psychology of the audience, which is easy to do!</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company's new sound production, "The Vengeful Spirits," directed by Shao Zuiweng and starring Hu Shan and Ma Loufen, has now been completed.</p>
<p>Local Investigation</p>
<h3>Another Visit to Lianhua's First Studio</h3>
<p>— Jizhong</p>
<p>Lianhua Company's first studio is the reincarnation of the former Minxin Company. Of course, here we can fully understand how Mr. Li Minwei, the director, sacrifices himself for art. The sale of a large property in the Guangdong area is strong evidence of this.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the first studio. Upon entering, there were countless painters and workers constantly working hard on their respective tasks, orderly, organized, and very serious, without the slightest hint of playfulness.</p>
<p>Director Li Minwei was amiable and approachable, personally receiving us. After exchanging pleasantries, the reporter began to ask him about Lianhua Company's recent plans, the progress of the first studio's new films, and various miscellaneous details. The following is Mr. Li's sincere report:</p>
<p>"Lianhua suffered losses from the January 28th Incident, and internally, we did implement a series of austerity measures. Therefore, at that time, external opinions seemed to suggest that Lianhua might collapse. In reality, this was just speculation. Director Wei Mingyou has worked hard, how could he lightly let it disappear? Now Mr. Luo has returned from Southeast Asia, where he received support and help from overseas Chinese. Perhaps Lianhua will establish another studio there, but nothing has been decided yet. As for our studio (Mr. Li modestly called it), we did feel a lack of directors. There was only Bu Wancang working alone. Now, in order to speed up production and for Mr. Bu's mental rest, we have hired two more directors, Fei Mu, who transferred from the Fifth Studio in Beiping, and Jiang Qifeng, who transferred from Youlian. Currently, in addition to "Modern Three Women" being completely finished, "Childhood China," "City Life," and "Love and Revolution" are being produced simultaneously. Regarding sound films, Lianhua may not produce them for the time being. When the Chinese-made film camera is successfully completed, Lianhua will definitely cooperate with them closely."</p>
<p>Star Biography</p>
<h3>Early Life of Tallulah Bankhead (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Meicun</p>
<p>Tallulah Bankhead was born in Alabama, USA, on January 31, 1902. Her young and beautiful mother almost gave up her life to give birth to her. After giving birth, she struggled for three weeks and finally passed away. Before her death, she asked about her two children, Tallulah and her sister Eugenia, saying, "I want to say a few words to them." So the family placed the twenty-one-day-old Tallulah beside her. Eugenia also stood by the bed, her round eyes looking at her mother, seemingly afraid. At this time, she said some sad words, but because no one else was standing in the room, what she said is unknown.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, her husband and family stood around watching her. She said, "Take care of Eugenia, but don't worry about Tallulah, she will take care of herself." This strange and inspired prediction—Tallulah can take care of herself, because her twenty-one days of age is enough to know what she wants—passed in an instant. Year after year, Tallulah grew from a young girl to a young woman. Indeed, she took care of herself and often took care of her sister Eugenia.</p>
<p>Tallulah was a temperamental and imaginative girl. She had a curiosity about everything around her. She could achieve great success in every moment.</p>
<p>Once, she took her grandfather's square-headed cigar and smoked it. He saw her and severely beat her. She felt very resentful. She thought this reprimand was too much, because she was climbing a chestnut tree when she smoked. After smoking this narcotic, she felt dizzy and fell from the chestnut tree. Coincidentally, her grandparents were sitting on chairs under the tree. They saw her and gave her a painful beating. Was it fair to be beaten after already suffering from smoking that "damn thing"?</p>
<p>Her temper was very bad. When she wanted something and couldn't get it, she would grab anything and throw it around. She would also lie on the floor, cover her ears with both hands, face down, and roll back and forth, making a fuss. Her black nanny would often be frightened, looking up and shouting loudly, "Miss Tallulah is having a tantrum again! Come and help me lift her up." In a moment, the whole family would rush to help her up, pat the dirt off her, and tell her to be quiet, until her doting aunt or strict grandparents gave her candy, and then she would stop crying. She often had these naughty and brave episodes. But she also came to her senses quickly and soon became precocious. In this era, she didn't like playing with children, she only liked being with adults. When she came to the house, she knocked on the door very respectfully. Her aunt heard her and asked, "Who is it?" She would answer in a soft voice, "It's Tallulah," and then open the door and come in.</p>
<p>During her childhood, Tallulah suffered from tonsillitis and bronchitis for several years. This is why it is said that she had a low vision. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Her Special Profession: Shouting</h3>
<p>— Ziyin</p>
<p>When recording sound films, when there is a scene of fear, the sound of a scream must be recorded. But not every star has a strong voice. Many big stars can't scream. Constance Bennett can't scream. Ruth Chatterton and Anne Francis also can't scream. As a result, a woman named Alice Doll has a special profession.</p>
<p>For example, when Bennett is in a murder scene, she has many screaming actions, but in reality, she doesn't make a sound.</p>
<p>Bennett said, "The sound I make when I scream is just 'eek.' If I really try to scream, I won't be able to speak for a few takes."</p>
<p>Her director quickly said, "Don't scream, it's too much of a loss. Alice Doll can scream for you."</p>
<p>Indeed, damaging a star's voice during filming is a great loss to the company. Many people will become hoarse from shouting too much. But there are also people like Alice Doll who can scream continuously without hurting their vocal cords. So she becomes a substitute for many famous stars in Hollywood.</p>

<h3>The Screenwriter's Joke</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The following story happened in Hollywood, USA. In the American film industry, there was a person who ran a film business. One day, he went to ask a screenwriter to write a script for him, and the content of the script had to include the following four things:</p>
<p>(1) Contains religious significance;</p>
<p>(2) Contains aristocratic elements;</p>
<p>(3) Contains sexual thoughts;</p>
<p>(4) Contains an element of fright.</p>
<p>In a few days, the screenwriter finished the script, but the filmmaker was confused when he saw it. It turned out that the script was very short, and its content said: "My God!" the Duchess cried, "take away your hand off my legs.”</p>
<p>The filmmaker went to consult the screenwriter. The screenwriter smiled and replied, "It's very easy to explain! You see, isn't 'God' of religious significance? Isn't the Duchess aristocratic? The lady asked the man to take his hand off her leg, isn't that sexual? Doesn't the Duchess's tone have a sudden element of fright? I've depicted all four things you wanted!"</p>
<p>So the filmmaker couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Film Treatise</p>
<h3>Like Horses in a Circus</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Acting in movies is different from acting in stage plays. In stage plays, the expressions of the actors progress gradually from the opening to the closing. Movies are different. When filming a movie, it is not filmed in order. The most patient director will tell you at most, "Now we are going to shoot the number shot. This shot is a close-up. You are angry because you have been offended by so and so. Now you have to grit your teeth and be angry." People who are used to acting on stage will feel that this kind of command is very unconscious. But you have to understand that movie actors are not acting there, they are taking pictures there. A movie is nothing more than many consecutive photos being shot back and forth into film, and then re-edited in order.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who are movie actors must have a greater ability to express emotions than stage actors. To use horses as a metaphor. The work of stage actors is like the work of horses in horse races or horses on the front lines. Although their work is not out of their own intentions, they can still get a little bit of nearly natural interest. The work of movie actors is like horses in a circus. It is difficult for him to get the opportunity to develop free will.</p>
<p>For this reason, when you practice, you must practice all kinds of facial expressions to the point where they come at will and are dismissed at will, so that you will not panic and be unable to deal with it after hearing the director's command.</p>
<p>When practicing the second style, keeping the state of anger, breathing can indeed help you achieve the tense emotions of anger, but your imagination must take on a large part of the work. You have to be able to imagine that the person in the mirror is your father's enemy, the one who hurt you, or, to put it bluntly, the rival who took your lover, and your resentment will naturally be realistic.</p>
