<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">世界經濟會議又玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>世界經濟危機。自本年入夏以來，似有轉換。日本受軍事工業之剌激。力事戰備。其一時興盛。姑置諸例外。美國自七月以後。各項産業股票一致上漲。以「聯合製銅廠」股票而論。不及兩月其市價上漲額達一倍有奇準此情形。則經濟恐慌也者。似己到達極底。今後將逐漸回復。第二次之繁榮指顧可期。然而實際情勢究竟何如。殊值得吾人之研究。</p>
<p>際此危急存亡之秋我中國允宜集其全力。以圖民族之自救。此種龐大無邊。於我關係較淺之問題。殊非吾儕所急。然而中國究不能脱離世界而獨立。更不能不與資本主義先進諸國發生密切關係。是故世界一般情形之變遷。無不間接直給予吾國以巨大影響。且也。各國救濟當前危難。開闢未來市塲。均以中國爲主要對。象則世界現象丨經濟的危機於我國能不生嚴重關聯耶。溯自一九二九年經濟恐慌發生以來。世界生産狀態。（蘇聯除外。以一九二八年生産爲基準。）一九三0年爲九0·八。一九三一年爲七七·三。本年上半期爲六一·0其跌落數字在四年半之間。竟至達二十九點。其嚴重程度爲何如。設使先進諸國分别而論。（以一九二八年爲基準）美國之生産爲五三·二·英國爲八0·六。法蘭西爲七三·四。法國爲五三·八。日本爲一0七·五蘇聯爲二0六·一。以上諸國。除日蘇兩國而外。無不萎縮。日本之所以略爲增漲者。亦非自然原因。乃爲備戰積極所致。蘇聯則在資本主義範圍圈外。又當别論。以煤鐵生産觀之。在美國煤炭生産量（自一九二九年以來）减低十分之六。英法約減十分之二。德國約減十分之三。日本亦減低約十分之二。鋼鐵生産。在美國則不及五年前三分之一。英國亦減低二分之一。法國亦減縮一半。德國亦不及一九二九年三分之一。日本僅能維持現狀。於是失業者羣集。最初均各自爲謀。决不念及國際的恊力。甚至肆力展開國際間一切予盾。努力於銷國政策。無如愈推演。則前途愈危殆。世界現金乃皆積聚於美法兩國之内。恐慌程度遂愈增加各國國民經濟更瀕險境矣。</p>
<p>英國原爲世界經濟中之指導者。亦爲現代先進諸國中之最老大者。於當前危機更不能不設法彌縫。苟眞能克服世界經濟恐慌。則英國自己之一切困難亦不難解决。是故前財長丘吉爾氏於本年五月十日英國議會討論財政法案時。竭力陳説世界經濟會議之必要。其主要論旨。乃在乎維持金幣價值。圖「通貨之安定。」爲最大急務。同時主張先由英美兩國共同發起。召集世界經濟會議。并於七月十四日國聯特别理事會恊議之結果。</p>
<p>「一、由國聯任命專門委員會。研究時政經問題。</p>
<p>一、推定西門氏爲該專門委員會之委員長。</p>
<p>一、專門委員會之下。設兩分科委員會。各以三名之財政專家爲其委員。</p>
<p>并徵求國聯事務局經濟及財政各部理事之援助。</p>
<p>一、徵求國際勞動事務局及羅馬萬國農業恊會之參加。</p>
<p>一、由國聯擔負該會費用。</p>
<p>上述各欵。即世界經濟會議具體化之表現。美國方面不但表示贊同。且認爲此係凡爾賽和會以後世界最重要會議之一。</p>
<p>此會議在提倡之初。其目的僅在圖世界通貨之安定。尚未計及其他。而實際上世界各國自經濟恐慌發生以來。曾盡其全力於産業合理化之促進。資本主義之經濟統制。通貨膨脹政策之推行等等。雖精疲力竭。仍未嘗握著經濟回復之機運。更未能圖得自國經濟生活之更生。是以此次世界經濟會議乃試爲國際的通貨膨脹政策之恊定。企圖扶殖物價上漲。且於金本位制度崩壞國家中整理其經濟現况。打開未來之新途徑。故其議題於「通貨安定」對策之外。「關税問題。」「對外滙兌問題。」以至於「賠欵戰債。」「銀價問題」等。皆將加以討論。於是世界經濟會議籌備會將於十月末日在倫敦開會。　　然則世界經濟會議果能順遂成功乎。在理想上當代諸名賢雖極望其一揮而就。克服當前危機。恢復己往繁榮。然而英法美日德意諸國利害既不一致。地位又各不同。其對於通貨安定。外滙關係。關税制度。以及金本位制等複雜問題。豈能虚心坦懷。化除自國利害爲基準之成見。而恊力一致乎。矧近年以來國家思想分外濃厚。國際合作早成過去。而現時經濟恐慌又屬資本主義先天帶來之必然性質。欲敷衍粉飭以渡過眼前難關。或屬可能。而謂世界經濟會議即可打破現勢。另開新局。誠恐未必有如是容易事耳。</p>

<p>畫、足爲日後關於軍備談判之基礎、對於法國計畫所有要點、認爲法德兩國成立妥恊、顯非難事、至少亦有妥恊之可能、</p>
<p>其説如下、（一）赫禮歐總理昨日主張縮短德國國防軍服役年限、可見凡爾塞和約中軍事條欵、法國並不堅持其必無更動之餘地、是則修改和約問題之主要點、蹊徑己闢、（二）赫氏提議短期兵投制度、當令其普及各國、此層德國業己提出要求、赫氏主張與之相符、（三）國際監督制度及搜查權利二項、只須一律相互行使、德國並無異議、（四）成立國際軍隊一層、德國方面僅有一種條件、即成立之前、須將各國軍制加以統一是也、（五）仲裁制度之充實及普及一項、德國並不整個加以否决、除此五端以外、少數障碍誠不能免、即如德國接受一九二八年普遍仲裁條約之時、其用意實欲使修改條約一層始終可能、此即障碍之一、但法德中間仍有談判之路、又國家主義派報紙對於法國軍縮計畫、雖激烈反對、然官方評論語氣則絶不相類、此層頗足欣幸、</p>

<p>▲哈瓦斯社二十九日華盛頓電、此間各報均以長文評論法國之軍縮計畫、但官方尚無任何宣言、非正式方面之印象、以爲法國計畫、係澈底研究而後成者、既與胡佛裁減三分之一之主張相合、又予日内瓦以成功之新希望、實爲一種「靈巧之計畫」云、説者又謂法國計畫中、要求美國給予安全保障、其辦法由美國自行斟酌一層、實係直接隐射國務卿史汀生對非戰公约必然效果之宣言、説者於此乃謂美國乘中日衝突之機會、由事實上表明該國願與其他各國互相諮詢而不游移、又表明巴黎非戰公約雖無互相諮詢之規定、亦能收運用之效、正與公約中明白規定諮詢辦法無異、由是又可見無論何種條約、如明白列入諮詢辦法、則美國本其歷來宗旨、必不樂於簽署、此外政界中人謂每逢談及此項問題、法國從未明白要求美國予以此項保障、此事至可欣幸、</p>

<p>法商總會主辦之硬地網球錦標賽、昨爲第二日、男子單打、興趣集中於余田光對史規亞之一組、史爲美僑之健將、與余實難分上下、結果余以七比五、四比六、六比二戰勝之、而得複賽權、同時其他一組梁德光以六比一、六比０勝克勞福、亦得複賽權、余梁將相逢於複賽、星期六起繼續舉行、</p>
<p>▲余田光勝史規亞兩人之勝負、全在水平缐上、雙方皆以長抽互鬥、惟余之出球、硬而有力、史觸網自不少、余併集全力、卒以克敵第一盤、余以浄四連勝二局、次史得二局、四比二、又成四比四、余勝五比四、史再平之、余卒以七比五獲第一盤、第二盤史以四比二、五比三居先、而以六比四、造成各一局面、决勝負之第三盤、史雖以二比一居先、竟連失五局、以六比二大敗、</p>

<p>錦標希望、惟倍·梅之一長一矮、亦甚可怕、</p>

<p>—周賢言隊以五比二勝—</p>
<p>—華員之表演均甚出色—</p>
<p>上海埠隊足球隊昨日下午三時在逸園舉行第一次試賽、觀者約有萬人、極一時之盛、結果周賢言隊以五比二大勝軋許隊、兩隊表演殊佳、興趣濃厚、各個技能、均發揮無遺、予顯有以極滿意之欣賞、兹記其經過如下</p>
<h3 id="c102">（一）球藝略述 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲周賢言隊周隊左内鋒透納未出塲、由</p>
<p>東華陳洪光代替、該隊之前鋒、似不及軋許之鋒鋭、惟昨日之表演、情形絶然不固、射門幾佳、聯絡亦妙、尤以陳家球之各方擺渡、最爲得力、勞頓與陳洪光亦臻上乘、最精鋭者、則爲守衛、周賢言之守門、固不必再加以批評、李甯與馮運動之兩内衛、堅爲鐵石、牢不可破、佈陣得當、控制有方、使理想中之軋許隊前鋒、竟難越雷池一步、中衛方面、徐亞辉風頭最健、飛奔全場、各方顧到、四面策應、其技遠在軋許之上、爲昨日與李馮兩内衛最出風頭之三人、右前衛惠斯伍亦甚可取、馬達次之、總之、周隊之守衛、遠在軋許隊之上、其以五比二獲勝者、洵非偶然</p>
<p>▲軋許隊軋許隊之表演實出於意料之外、開始後之前一刻鐘内、殊爲勇猛、前鋒緊逼周隊、使周賢言忙於應救、幸未失利、但從此以後、竟一籌莫展、陳容散亂、難於進窥、加以周隊防禦嚴密、無懈可擊、李義臣之表演、較前頗見退步、且行動遲慢、脚頭不準、最大毛病、在乎不能與人合作、故李昨日未見有出色之處、陳鎭和每有孤掌離鳴之概、守衛方面、遠遜周隊、均無傑出表演</p>
<h3 id="c103">（二）比賽經過 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>▲第一球軋許隊開球、進攻甚猛、前鋒殊爲驍勇、周賢言屬瀕於危、拳擊脚踢、幸而抬架得法、龍門得保無恙、二十分鐘時、周隊興兵進攻、家球洪光與勞頓短兵傅進、攻破防線、勞頓一舉成功、極清晰有力、</p>
<p>▲第二球軋許隊門前被踢任意球、周隊徐亞輝踢甚佳、守門台維特救出、此波既平、五六分鐘後、周隊捲土重來、勞頓單槍匹馬、横行無阻、又破龍門、成二比零、此上半時之結果也　　▲第三球下半時開始約三分鐘時、周隊右翼法凡怯至底線處、送球中央、軋許門前、頗逞蕭條氣象、陳洪光頭頂得法、頂球入門、爲狀至美、成三比零、</p>
<p>▲第四球是球又爲陳洪光頭頂而入、得力於陳家球之遠傅、洪光可謂善於用頭者矣、是球之進、距第三球僅二三分鐘耳、</p>
<p>▲第五球周隊勝第四球後、軋許隊中央開球、一致而下、陳鎭和、李義臣、勃恩斯、肩摩踵接、直入敵營、至相當時間、陳鎭和攻門、球應聲入網、軋許隊乃開紀録、成一比四、</p>
<p>▲第六球　周隊右前衛惠斯伍、對軋許隊球門踢任意球、球飛向門前、勞頓頭頂、球向右方而去、台維特欲救未得、球爲陳家球得、急射中的、成五與一之比、</p>
<p>▲第七球旋見李甯耳部受傷、周賢言因顧李而能全神顧及球勢、於是内部頓見空虚、龍門亦告動摇、軋許隊李義臣帶球溜進、一舉成功、送成五比二之結果、周暨言隊勝、</p>
<h3 id="c104">（三）觀戰一得 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>昨日尚爲初次試賽、正式陣缐、尚難確定、尚須經過第二或第三次之演習後、始能决計、當軸諸君對於選擇人才、自有卓見、兹將記者昨日觀戰所得略述如下</p>
<p>▲守門與内衛守門一戰、周賢言獨步申江、莫與嫓美、當選正式選手、毫無疑問、内衛方面、李甯與馮運佑仁人、應付有才、措置得法、毫無痴點、照昨日之觀察、正式選手、亦非李溤莫屬、</p>
<p>▲前衛人材前衛人材、最難解决者、爲徐亞輝與幹許二人、軋許身膺試賽除長、且爲歷次上海埠際隊之隊長渠之當選中堅、勢所必然、然此君今年歷次比賽、均未有良好表演、昨日亦未能例外、而新自然馬來亞來滬之徐亞輝君之表演、爲目下海上中堅之巨魁、鮮有出右者、昨日以及己往之表演、均殊出色、非軋許所及、實有當選正式中堅要職之可能、但軋詐因資望、較高、且與西人顔面有關、其技能雖不能勝徐、然徐難有攫軋許之職而居、若不得己而求其次、或將徐充左或右前衛耳、至於另一前衛、惠斯伍入選呼聲似最高、</p>
<p>▲前鋒之陣容、前鋒陣容、殊難支配、觀</p>
<p>昨日之情形、以陳家球、陳鎭和、陳洪光及勞頓四人最高、其次爲法凡怯、阿爾傑、萬象華、萬因身矮力小、難應大敵、法凡怯因昨日邊鋒之最佳者、惜脚頭遲緩、美中不足、以上述人材支配、可以勞頓爲中鋒、洪光待左内、家球充右内、鎭和任左翼、法凡怯在右翼、李義臣如能在第二次試賽中、用全副精神以謀上好之成績、固不難有録選之可能、</p>
<p>以上所述、固記者之愚見也、或不足爲識者所齒、兹事重大、選擇委員、自有高見、支配最完整强固之陣容也、昨日陣缐如下、</p>

<p>自由談	九三老人馬相伯語録難道你不願做難民頭？　　相老人聽到贛東逃共的，有二千多户流落浙省衢屬，同時受本地人的藐視，和婦孺乞食江邊船頭的情景，不禁歎道　　「我是過來人、幾十年前逃長毛難，身嘗過痛苦。因此逃難的人需要救濟，我很明瞭的！不是中産人家，决難逃亡在外：既逃出來後，年數太久，進欵没有，一家家都當光吃光：仰面求人，又很難乎爲情！稳痛難忍，會易墮落！既然本地人欺生，抬高房錢物價等，又有難民中流落爲娼等情，總之，良家子女，應該救命！最好，衢縣縣長，任命一個贛籍有才有志的好人物，同時呌他兼難民頭。一面可以防匪，一面可以濟難：「一舉兩全！」　　因此，分函商懇的結果：得浙籍A院長B主席，和五院中的C院長，連名向浙省主席，保荐一個贛東人。　　這一位學者，原任大學教授，主辦津港大報；現承保荐，求做縣長，一看荐函，很不自安：他是相老人的學生，當受教訓：　　「你不必笑呢！當正經事做！因爲你是江西人，應救難中的同鄉！宗教捨己救人的精神，是如此的！你不願做縣長：難道也不願做難民頭麽？我告訴你，替萬多民遭難父老請願去！」　　這位果然聽話，曾親身去請願：三位中央委員保荐結果，成功了「先予存記」的縣長。過幾個月，没有消息，相老人對他説：　　「我們盡了這一番心意：看來難民頭輪不到你身上來了！」菊花的精神  吕夢黨　　—是弱小民族的典型—　　秋深了！北風帶着嚴厲的呼聲、不住的括着，四面陰沉沉遮起灰色的雲，太陽失去了己往的威嚴，很没精打采的在雲堆裏射出些微弱的光綫來，院子裏積滿了許多枯黃的落葉，它們都是被暴力的壓迫者啊！　　大地上很荒凉，一切都呈出蕭瑟的</p>
<p>景象！偶然飛過了一陣雁羣，好像帶了關外的消息，引起我無限的思維！　　昨天晚上的霜，下得很大，早晨起來我又添上了一件夾襖，信步走了出去，遠遠的一帶楓樹林，紅得像血一樣，一家破籬笆外種着七八盆菊花，鮮潔可愛，花瓣上還藏着些未融化的霜呢！看了它不由得不欽佩它的精神，它實在是一個不届服不懦怯的勇敢者！它抱着大無畏的態度·才能在這慘澹的時期裏衆死獨生，它的生存可以説是天天在那裏奮鬥的，否則撲滅它的危機正環繞在它的四週啊·！　　在破籬笆下，不覺徘徊了好久，念了幾首古人咏菊的詩，悠然神往，我始終以爲它的精神，非但值得我們敬仰，同時也很值得我們仿傚·所以末了，我很願將「菊花的精神」，謹獻於弱小民族之前·辦公室裏  金不同　　—五個不同的模型—　　我們辦公室裏，，連我一共五個人，可以説是五個不同的模特兒，現在我想各個的描寫一下，那倒是很有趣的。　　主任胡先生，是位頭號大胖子，今年立夏那一天，在他府上所設的那個米，號裏請客，幾位同事把他扶在磅秤上一，稱，竟不折不扣的二百零八磅。他很健談。雖然己是近五旬的人，還很喜歡同年青的同事談笑　　副主任張先生，同胡先生正是一個反比例。瘦得只有一百零八磅重。各頓飯只吃大半碗，全但每頓却要喝酒二斤。一天到晚，辦六小時公，和同事們，談不到十句話，有事去問他時，他的答語，往往是摇頭和點頭。　　秘書陳先生，是滴酒不飲的，但是一個酒糟鼻頭，却誇耀着一肚子的黃湯。一天到晚，據説末有十枝雪茄烟過癮,是過不去的。他比了胡主任還要健談,而最愛談性的那回事,往往説得有聲有色，但是今年辦公室裏請了一位女書記，陳先生的性話，減少了不少。　　書記李女士，是今年春上來的。來了之後，每天必有一封彩色信封的信，風雨無間的，今年初秋，伊忽然請了十天假。從那時起，彩色信封的信絶迹了一天，胡主任問伊假期裏是否去結婚的，伊紅了臉，把頭摇了一摇。　　收發就是在下。在下把鏡子照了一下，覺得粗粗的皮膚，紅了的臉，活像從前同學們的替我起的雅號「鄉下人」。但是現在的同事，都呌我「小老頭子」，我看我們副老成持重的尊容,倒也没幾分像處。中國人的道德  怡怡飩館主　　丨從電桿上的怪字條談到馬路上的香蕉皮—我們走在路上所瞧見的，除了花花緑緑的紅男緑女之外，時常還得瞧見那電桿木上貼着紅紙黑字寫的怪字條。什麽「出賣得傷風，一見諔成功！」以及「天皇皇，地皇皇，我家有個小兒」郎，過路君子唸一篇，一覺睡到大天光！」等等標語式的怪字條，令人見了，好氣又好笑。試一探討這種怪字條的寓意之所在，自然囉，不外乎是「損人利己」的勾當！雖屬迷信得可發一笑，但是，中國人的道德，於此可以想見一斑！還有，走在路上，使我們瞧見感到奇怪的，就是那些被遺棄的「香蕉皮，」横七竪八的，有似「東新橋」「西新橋」以及「泥城橋」等處的野鷄一般，充斥於馬路現代對話可·人·　　甲婦：王家四妹眞福氣！他現在嫁與XXX做了小老婆，比起從前,是兩個人了。頭上是插金戴銀，身上是穿綢着緞，每餐是吃魚吃肉，丫頭一用二三個，樣樣不要自己動手，只管陪着男人現就是了。你想，我們及得上伊嗎？　　乙婦：不是嗎，伊雖然説起來是人家的小老婆，然而，現成的快樂，是伊享受了。爲人在世，原是圖個快樂、小老婆不小老婆，有什麽關係呢？之上。你如果走路不小心，就得吃這種被棄的「香蕉皮」的虧了，弄的不好，連性命都不保！唉！「中國人的道德！」男女用字的不平等  睡蓮　　—女界同胞曷一注意—　　女子到了十九世紀，不復再届服於男子淫威之下，一切的一切，都解放過來，應與男子享同等的權利也。所以愛倫凱女士有這麽一句話：「十九世紀是女子的世紀。」　　現在是二十世紀了。那末女子解决運動，當更爲澈底，更爲普遍了。但揆諸現實，則不能無惑，别的國家，别的事項，都不去説他，單就我國關於女子方面文字上用字一項言，含着侮蔑之意的，所在多有！　　（一）尤物　今多稱女子之美色相者曰光物，以物名女子，總有些不對，况物之爲義，有買賣之性質寓焉。　　（二）她代男用的他字從人，代女子用的她字從女，借用公孫龍子白馬非馬的解法，則女子非入了　　此外有許多名稱，對女子用可，對男子用則不可。如女子可稱「女流」，「男流」便成笑話，「女士」很通行，「男士」則爲罕聞。　　只此文字一項，因男女而異其用字，就有如此之多！今欲謀男女一切同躋於平等地位，則爲期尚遠咧。短訊  拙庵雅歌集爲海上最老之票社，近因會務發展，另卜新居於大陸商塲三樓三三四號，該處房屋軒爽，佈置完善，是以日來新會員之加入者，頗不在少數，上星期六夕特開新舊會員聯歡大會，觥籌交錯，濟濟一堂，酒數巡後，話匣大開，王得天陳良玉楊奎侯諸君相繼演説，詼諧備至，盡歡而散，雅歌成立迄今，己二十有二年，現定於下月十二三兩日，假座湖社舉行二十二周之紀念彩排，聞新舊會員，各將演其擅長之戲劇云，故都聞見録  銖庵　　▲警吏　　光緒三十年始設京師警察廳，以直隸省辦警察爲之基礎，趙秉鈞朱啓鈐實始其事，二人以幹敏著於當時也，王公宗室豪家貴主素驕恣，横行輦轂，不知有所謂違警律，警察執行職權，動被製肘，甚至横遭毆辱，然以此之故,警察亦多能養成和平順正之風，汪　卿筆記有左列一事，足見北京警察程度之一斑，　　己酉梓宫奉移之前日，某貴族之馬車將由天橋御道而出，警兵阻不可，貴族大怒，盛肄威嚇，警兵鞠躬前日，天橋者恁家之天橋地，常人不得由中間御道者，恁家之法制也，警兵何知，惟知遵行定章而己，今恁以恁家之人而欲破壞恁家之法，何不可之有，何怒警兵爲乎，貴族無話而去，此警兵之語無幾，而透澈婉轉，惜未知其姓名也，上海天津等處租界巡捕，遇違章口角之事，輒拳足交下曳赴捕房，不容分辨，若行人偶就之問道，則岸然仰視天，若不欲置答，北平警察無是也，偶遇糾紛，必向兩造施廣長舌，爲之排解，排解不獲己，始帶入區署，對問道者必卿顔一再申説指示，期於盡解，街頭巷尾多有警察派出所，木屋二間，中貯户籍，若遇訪友而不審其門牌，則直造所中一查便得，甚至鄰近居人以私事借用電話，亦得優容，此由曾受特殊之主訓練，以和平忍辱之態度執行職務，漸得都人信用，又警察多族籍，旗人素以詞令嫺婉見長，北人多馴謹守法，故令不嚴而行、，以此愈形警政之肅，警察怠職則自民國十二年黎元洪之被迫去位始，先是軍閥某某欲逐黎去以掀起風波，苦於無名，乃嗾使主同級軍警長官百餘人圍居仁堂索欠飭，黎猶不去，乃嗾使警察罷岡，甚至斷絶黎邸電燈水管以窘之，乃跟蹌出國門，自庚子以後，政府威嚴掃地，未有若斯之甚者，北都之運，由此遂覆，夫警察罷工，參與政治，此何等危險事，而可以長官密令行之邪，若輩倒行逆施，教猱升木，不顧大體若此，其敗亡接踵身蹈故轍亦宜矣，民國六七年以前，北京警政爲全國冠，幾於道不拾遺，小小盜竊從無不破案者，近年漸衰弛，然巨案未破者亦鮮觀，十七年以後厲行房捐，警餉有著，精神漸爲一振，往時保安隊由瑞典客	卿曼德訓練者，著自行纏，服色差整，而街頭警卒則長袍帶劍，不足壯觀，近己悉易爲黑行纏，武裝鉤帶，佩手槍，執指揮棍，維持都市治安，綽有餘裕矣</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言規與矩  慈民　　！代表兩種處世方式！　　前天本刋談言欄，載有「處世的藝術」一篇大作，鄙人細讀一過，竟發生許多感想　　X　X　X　　據説上古時的車輛，是用一塊方方正正的木頭做的，運轉起來，很不靈便，到後來人事日繁，逐漸進步，才知道用圓木來代替，然而，單是硬壳壳的圓木，現在又不適用了，經無數人細心研究的結果，知道橡皮做的車輪，既是圓。而且又富於彈性。要算最適宜於走路了。但是，車輪僅僅圓而富於彈性，一般人還是覺得不夠的，於是别關蹊徑，精益求精，又發明了使車輪的運轉。可以減少摩。擦力的滑潤的滾子，自然，裝着這種圓。滑。而且富於彈性的車輛的車子，是最會。受現代社會上的人歡迎的，　　一個人處世方法的歷史的進化，與車輛的進化的歷史，有什麽兩樣呢，　　X　　X　　X　　當一塊四角方方的磗頭或石子，頭角峥嵘的高躱在山頭上的時候，他俯瞰着那些自己毫無主張而浮沉在浪濤中，被海水衝洗得那般光滑，圓渾的父老輩，自然會表示不滿，而要高喊着腐化，惡化，落伍，等口號的，但是，有一朝啊，那個頑皮的樵夫，把他拾起來，抛入范范大海中去了，海潮急流滾滾地，一刻不停的推湧着，動盪着，把牠摟抱。在懷中，一秒，一分，一刻，一日，…年深月久的不斷的撫摩他，侵蝕他，於是石子受到意外難於抵抗的打擊了，既不能「孤軍奮鬥」便必須「同流合污」，如果石子的禀質堅硬些，到頭來還有剩下幾個微微突起的稜角的可能，否則，就會同被他曾經諷剌過的父老輩一樣地被磨琢得又光滑，又圓渾的了，　　海水不就是社會，石子不就是青年嗎，　　X　X　X　　我們把握了這個道理，就可用以解。釋社會上一切矛盾的現象。而「一般人爲什麽都要跨進處世的藝術學校。」這個問題。也便解决了一大半，文藝多麗（黃鶴樓懷古）  陳家慶　　暮山青，漢陽烟樹冥冥，對楚天滄　　波無際，似聞鼓瑟湘靈，白雲飛，　　昔人何在，黃鶴去，仙夢都醒，涙　　灑西風，情深故國，每因懷古感飄　　萍，自江上梅花吹落，玉笛那堪聽　　，空留得鴉横落日，水滿寒汀，　　對千古興己歷歷，只餘一角危奇，　　浪花深，英雄淘盡，關河老，風物　　凋零，帆影依欄，鐘聲送客，隔江　　漁火正星星，又獨立晚雲無語，玉　　兎湧滄溟，關心處，畫中樓閣，屐　　齒曾經，（却酬）顧彼失此　政科學肥料  湘　　動物是如同一部機器，要時常上油才能用，用久了就壞了。植物也是如同一部機器，一樣的須要幫助牠的營養料，他才能生活下去。那麽植物的營養料是什麽呢？牠生活一方面靠吸空氣中的二氣化炭，一方面在泥土中吸取磷，氣，鉀，鐵，鈣，鈉·鎂等物質做牠的養料，靠這些物質而生存。有些物質植物吸收得很少，土中通常含得足夠植物需要而有餘，如鐵，鈣，鈉，鎂等。尚有些物質爲土中往往缺乏不夠供給植物的需要，所以我們要加以種種不夠的物質入土中，以補土中的不足，土中所缺少的是鉀，磷，氮，三種原質，我把三種分述如下；　　（一）鉀素肥料　　有些山石中含有鉀素，受了風雨的侵蝕，而分解成土壤，因此土壤中有許多鉀素的化合物了，但是不足。陸上的植物，有許多都含有鉀，用火燃燒後，炭酸鉀遺留在草木灰中。草木灰之可以做肥料，就是因爲牠中間有炭酸鈝，可以幫助植物生長，工業上製鉀鹽肥料多用氣化鉀。　　（二）氮素肥料　　氮素爲植物所必需的養料，缺少了就不行。普通的植物都用根在泥中取氮素，因此氮素肥料不足，所以加人糞，尿，豆粕，紫雲英，乾血入土中，因爲牠們含有多量的氮。有許多皂莢類的植物，如大豆，緑豆，碗豆等，牠們有些很特别的東西，在牠們的根部，就是一個個的小根瘤。你不相信請你去看看。在那瘤中有許多很小的微生物（Bacferia），吸收空氣中遊離的氮氣，使變成化合的氮，溶在水中以供豆本身的吸收，自己吸收不了，還把多出的氮素肥料留在土中，使劣土變成肥土，你看這種植物多麽奇妙和有用啊！硝酸鈉，硝酸鈣，硫酸錏都含氮很富，硝酸鈉含有最多的氮，對於植物有很大的幫助，可以在最短的期間，使缺氮的植物，充分的吸收氮，而收效。　　（三）燐酸鹽肥料　　燐酸鹽類，植物須要得很多，土中時常缺乏牠。果木樹需要得量多，因爲牠缺少，對於樹的生長也發生了障礙，有些農民只知道放許多骨粉，不錯！骨粉中含有很多的燐酸鈣，但是不容易溶在水中，植物便不能直接吸收。如加以適當的硫酸來處置，可使牠變爲可溶性的過磷酸鈣（過燐酸石灰）、而供值物的吸收。　　以上的三種爲市上所賣肥料的基本原料，可是也不可亂用。必定要依着土中含量的多少，多則不加，少則加多。改良社會討論會爲商榷新家庭標準敬答王明星先生  朱允宗　　本刋日前所載拙著「新家庭的標準」一文，其中重要點，在打倒吾國數千年來腐敗之家族制度。昨晚閲報，拜讀王明星先生之佳文，對於拙著，大抒偉見，加以指評，欽佩莫名！感激無己！惟中有未敢苟同之處，今復略而言之：</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>王先生謂「中國之社會不良，人稱萬惡，其重要原因，愚以爲不在家庭，第一在政府不能使人民安業，解决民生問題；第二人民以個有單位論，良莠不齊………而第二原因實與第一原因連續無殊。」允宗則謂政府之所以不能不人民安業，解决民生問題，正以舊家庭之未經改革！試觀吾國舊家庭之組織；一家之中，家長爲元首，家人臣僕耳！生殺賞罰之權，悉操家長之手，實一小專制國之君主。至吾國歷史上之政府，不過擴充家族制度而己！周建人先生在「中國舊家庭制度之變動」中有句話説：「中國舊家庭制度是君主專制政治之雛形。」國家猶一大家族、君主乃一家長，臣民即家人：大衆失自由平等之權利，於是嫉妒，傾軋，依頼，欺詐諸病象畢現，而萬惡之社會形成矣，　　今吾國名義上雖易民主，實際上猶仍舊觀。家族制度牢不可破，擁兵自衛之元首，一如家長，一如專制魔王丨家族觀念隨處作崇、即以各機關用人而言，多以血統爲緣，所謂「裙帶關係」「生殖器關係」，均爲仕進之捷徑！舞弊營私，不可究語，職是之故，政府雖以實行？三民主義相號召，竟至民生艱困，民權喪失，民族瀕亡！然則舊家庭實爲社會萬惡之源，烏得謂爲無涉耶？　　至王先生之謂余所擬家庭標準，只爲富人説法，不合一般家庭，則標準中涉及經濟各項，因爲貧苦家庭所談不到，但擬定標準自一事，而吾國現今大多數家庭不能合此標準又是一事，似不可併爲一談。　　若王先生所謂「擁有巨資之富翁，庭庭殊無改良之必要。」説似欠當！余觀世之富家翁，姬妾滿室，僕婢成羣，即不合新家庭標準第三項：子女依遺産爲靠山，安坐而食，作寄生蟲。又與第八項不符丨且有私自利，不熱心公益，則與末項相背，凡此種種，均須改良，王先生何護富人之短？　　綜觀王先生大文，反對拙著之處，有二要點；（一）社會之萬惡，不由於家庭。（二）家庭標準，在現狀下，失却「一般性」。兹己逐點辯正，王先生及高明之讀者以爲何如？社會一角啞吧阿三  曉光　　一向冷落得像死去一般的街道，新近幾天忽地熱閙起來，而且整天都是嚷着嘈雜的聲音，彷佛繁華都市的清晨，衖堂裏的轆轆糞車聲驚破了蜜的美夢似的使人感到不痛快。　　這條街道之所以猛然喧嚷的原因，據説近來有個啞吧名呌阿三的在這里操皮肉生涯丨並不是像人肉市場的都市馬路上的野鷄所操的那種皮肉生涯丨因爲</p>
<p>這種勾當。在這思想陳舊的古城裏的人們，却認爲是一套新奇的把戲呢。一般買主祇要化幾個銅板，便能在這啞吧的身上得到滿足發洩的機會：這種化本少而獲益多的事情，誰不願意去發洩發洩他滿肚子的牢騷呢？因此，啞吧便在這個古城裏得到了「鐵漢」的渾號。　　是一個嚴冬的早上，濃厚的白霜，舗滿了整個的古城，剌骨的寒風，猛烈地，在四野狂嘯，幾隻街狗，像凍死了一般的伏在石階上一動也不能動。太陽的光芒，慢慢地落到地平線上來了，被濃霜深鎖着的古城，在這時候，才漸漸地開始恢復牠活動的生命。　　啞吧阿三穿着一件藍布短衫，白粗布褲，精神煥發的站在一家小酒店門首等着主顧的光臨。　　他生有一副雄偉的身架，皮膚被太陽炙得像荳板醬一樣的粗黑，脚上拖了一雙破碎的布鞋，光着頭，筆直地站在那裏，牠那粗而帶着誠誠實的面龐，老是抺上一層淡淡的笑容，不消説，這是爲了得到主顧歡心的一種應酬了。　　「啊……吧……啊……吧……」啞吧阿三一手握緊了拳頭向自己的胸前輕輕地搥着，一手用指頭計算擊拳的次數；在他微笑的眼角裏似乎這樣向我們説：「如果你願意給我一個銅板，讓狠命地在我身上打一拳吧！不，頭部和兩腰請免打……」　　他提高了粗大的嗓子在喊着：「啊……吧……啊……吧」，而觀衆也越來越多了，有些人贊嘆他有山東嚮馬那樣本領，也有人駡他生下就帶來一副賊骨：在啞吧阿三始終不知道他們在説的是什麽話，依然展開一事副英雄氣的笑臉，向四圍的觀衆招呼生意。　　「唧唧」，二個銅板滾到啞吧阿三的脚前了，阿三迅速地脱下他的藍布短衫，坦然的挺起胸板，祈待主顧拳頭的光臨，果然，「擲……擲」的在他胸前發出了肉與肉碰擊的聲嚮來。主顧像戰勝的兵士，奏着凱歌而去了！觀衆一陣喝采隨着掌聲而起了。　　不久，擠進一個倭瘦的觀衆，看他的年紀大概是四十以外吧，據説，這早本地某紳士家的拳師：他慷慨的從衣袋裏措出二角錢，親熱地向阿三的手中一放，立刻，阿三的胸板上便繼續的嚮着：「擲……擲擲……擲擲……擲擲……」……」這位主顧似乎感到一些疲倦了，才大踏走的離開了人叢。阿三究竟與我們同樣的生着一副肉架，經過這一次狠命的毒打，臉上便浮起一層青白的顔色，他輕輕地撫摸着這透出絲絲血水的胸膛，頽喪的離開了小酒店門口，觀衆仍是很高興的各自散去了。　　第二天，這條街道重又冷落下去，因爲没有阿三的影子在這條街上閃動着。　　一星期以後，東廊的破廟裏發現一個屍體，人家都説那個屍體，就是生前賣皮肉的啞吧阿三。　　自此以後，這古城的人們，好像没有啞吧阿三這個人似的依然自私自利的行活下去。悲劇　　銀的自殺  亢石　　深秋的清晨，一陣陣風愈吹愈厲，那灰白色的雲，從天脚聚合起來，漸漸地從金風中送下一線線雨絲，多麽的慘淡！悽凉·　　銀，己經失業了幾個月，正在自怨自艾，望首窗兒發怔，忽然：看見無情的秋雨，從窗外打來，不覺身體在抖着，呵！單衣不能抵敵肅煞的金風了，同時：又多麽的憂急！因爲夾衣棉衣被飢神的壓迫，把牠押在長生庫中，現在呢！無力贖回，把單衣掉換呢！當然：抵不過的，銀也没有辦法，只在發抖着！寒神的壓迫！　　一陣樓梯的聲音中，又帶着一種聲音：「銀！在嗎？」　　銀，聽見了馨音，知道楊君在尋他，從鴿籠般的房中應着：「在！」那時己經走出迎着：　　大家坐了一會兒，楊君的面上不自然的説道：「銀！你所移的欵，現在己經過期了，今天可有預備？」　　銀的臉上頓時發着灰白色，隔了好一會兒，始行有氣無力的答道：「對不起！現在實在没有法兒，請你原諒一些吧！」　　「不興！那是你所約的期，豈可背信？」姓楊的這樣説：　　「總算我們是老交，寛量一些吧！因爲我失業了好久，坐吃也要山空的，那裏還有力量來還欵子，請你寛限十天吧！」銀這樣的要求着説：　　「可以是可以的，不過：再不要背信好了！」姓楊的一面説：一面告别走了。　　	忽然：又是一陣樓梯的聲音，走上一個二房東，也喊着：「銀在嗎？」那時己經走進了銀的房中説道：「房租己經到期了，今天有嗎？」　　「剛巧不恰好，明天吧！」銀這樣的回答：　　等第二房東去了，銀多麽的憂急！明天的房租，和十天後楊君的欵子，那裏去尋？躊躇了半天、由憂急而怨憤，由怨憤而悲傷，由悲傷而消極，灰意，覺着人生怎樣的痛苦！把「死」字當做解掉痛苦的唯一方法，急促地從袋中拿了四角錢，走到烟子窠中，買了一盒鴉片回來。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，二房東擂着銀的房門喊道：「銀！今天房租有了嗎？」這樣的重復了幾句，竟然；一些聲息都没有·頓時起昨夜銀在呻吟着：「難道他自殺了嗎？」二房東一面疑惑着，一面把房門設法打開了，把二房東嚇了一跳，大聲的喊道：　　「銀自殺了！銀服毒了」訂婚條件是此訂婚  凌波　　潤自開始他如渴如醉地追求異性，他非偶然的找到了愛的對像莫，起初終是潤渴力向對方獻着殷勤，欲想得到她的歡心，無非先播下一些愛情的種子，收獲以待將來，但是莫的態度，很是黯然不明，若可親，時若不可親，具更撩動他火熱的心，瘋樣地發狂，這不是她固意地玩弄他，豈是勾引他呢。　　單戀的情書，雪片般地飛來，她也毫不拒絶他，而且如無誠意地去接受他，自此，越止不住地使他情急起來了。　　莫非經過有了長時期的觀察，他己澈透了她的心裏，或許現代一般女子給他的一個經騐，不顧自己冒味，，他修好了一封遺産核算表式的求婚書，並允許她將來組織小家庭的時候，有一座精緻的小洋房，一輛最新式的汽車，一切她的需求，可以用他的財力，這封信一去，效力比怎樣還大，在她愛慕的微笑中，固然，焉然答允了。　　現在正在進行訂婚中，莫提出不了可少地幾件貴重的手飾，有鑽，有珠，有翠，她是認爲對於訂婚上最重要，一半還帶條件性的，併且她意諒對，潤什樣的富有，足夠担任，决不成這麽問題。　　這幾日來的潤，若負了一副千鈞的重担，對於自己的婚事依舊未能抱樂觀，倘使手飾没有辦法，　　前轟動熱烈進行的親事，今反弄得默然無聞了。來函　　記者先生大鑒屢讀貴刋常有橡膠事業發表，鄙人從事製革及醬色二業多年，然頗喜研究橡膠，兹特徵求同志數人，最好現服務於橡膠廠者，或以金錢爲交換，或以學識爲交換，或以上業製作爲交換，然鄙人並非年利，純以研究橡膠爲宗旨，特此修函，祈爲照登，一切有瀆清神，此請譯安，穆雲五謹上通訊處百老匯路亞德路二十四號  穆雲五公布佈江蘇高等法院第二分院　　▲民事裁定　一件爲朱福根等與吴朱氏請付紅利涉訟案件聲請中止訴訟程序本院裁定如左主文聲請駁回聲請費用由聲請人負担（十月二十七日）　　▲一件爲陳福康與鄭仁業因債務涉訟上訴一案本院裁定如左主文上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担（十月二十八日）　　▲民事判决　張繼高與楊子卿因欠欵涉訟上訴案、（主文）原判决關於上訴人應償還被上訴人之數額及被上訴人應償還上訴人洋二千零零八元部分及訴訟費用部分變更上訴人應付還被上訴人洋五千元由三千元自民國十五年十二月二十四日起至執行終了日止給付按年八厘之利息又二千元自民國十五年十二月二十四日起至執行終了日止給付按月一分二厘之利息上訴人其餘之上訴在第一審之反訴假執行之聲請及被上訴人在第一審其餘之訴均駁回第一二兩審之本訴訴訟費用由上訴人負担七份之五被上訴人負担七分之二兩審之反訴訴訟費用由上訴人負担▲一件大耀建築公司與五本號因欠欵涉訟上訴案（主文）上訴及附帶上訴均駁回第二審訴訟費用由兩造各自負担▲一件陳玉麒與林益先等因通行權涉訟上訴案（主文）上訴駁回第二審及前第三審訴訟費用由上訴人負担▲一件林雪懷與胡蝶因解除婚約及債欵涉訟上訴案（主文）原判决關於借欵六百元及訟費部分變更被上訴人關於前項借欵之訴駁回第三審及前第三審訴訟費用由被上訴人負担五分之四餘由上訴人負担▲一件周長賽與聚康醬園因返還利益涉訟上訴案（主文）上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担▲一民事裁定方陳雯琴與方汪氏等因赡養費聲請訴訟救助抗告上訴案（主文）准予訴訟救助▲一件陸惠元等與錦興公司孫春生因欠租及遷讓涉訟上訴案（主文）抗告駁回抗告費用由抗告人負担（以上十月二十六日）上海地方法院　　　▲民事判决　判决吴建耀與張瑞銘因請求給付房租及遷讓案（主文）被告應给付原告房租洋一百零五元並應即遷讓出屋原告假執行之聲請駁回訴訟費用除假執行馨請費用及撤回部分十分	之一由原告負擔外餘由被告負擔十分之九▲王錦初與吴濬臣因請求償還欠欵涉訟案（主文）被告應償還原告銀洋六百四十元訴訟費用由被告負擔▲邵毓英與敖戟森因請求诎離婚案（主文）原告負被告之婚姻應予離異訴訟費用由被告負擔▲姚榮生與陸及卿因保證債務案（主文）原判决關於姚榮生負擔代償方連順所欠原告飯欵之部分廢棄被上訴人在第一審關於上開部分之訴駁回第二審及前第三審訴訟費用上訴人負擔五分之一被上訴人負擔五分之四▲張驥因聲請假扣押一案（主文）抗告駁回抗告費用由抗告人負擔▲李朱氏與李兆榮因請求離異案（主文）原告之訴駁因訴訟費用由原告負擔憂▲憂芝芳與周桃生因請求給付貨欵涉訟案（主文）被告應給付原告貨欵銀一千九百九十六元七角五分訴訟費用由被告負擔▲陳友美與朱根福因請求償還借欵涉訟案（主文）原判决關於原餘之訴駁回及訴訟費用原告負擔五分之二部分廢棄被上訴人應償還上訴人洋三百元第一審訟費應用被上訴人負擔五分之二本審訟費亦俱由被上訴人負擔▲金庭會館所爲裁庭抗告一案（主文）抗告駁回抗告費用由抗告人負擔▲周學文所爲裁定抗告一案（主文）抗告駁回抗告費用由抗告人負擔▲張順林與赫郎生因借欵小訟案（主文）上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負擔▲秦根全與嚴學廷因請求償還抵欵涉訟案（主文）被告應償還原告抵欵洋一千元並自借欵之日起至執行終了日止按月一分五厘利息（應扣除己付過利息洋三百五十元）訴訟費用由被告負擔▲陳春元與孫萬餘因請求返還船隻涉訟案（主文）原判第一項及訴訟費用部分廢棄上訴人應返還被上訴人原租船一隻即小船一隻被上訴人在第一審返還其餘船隻部分之訴駁回第一審訴訟費用由上訴人負擔三分之一被上訴人負擔三分之二第二審訴訟費用由被上訴人負擔▲王阿寳與鄭關後因請求撤銷契約涉訟案（主文）上訴駁回第二審訟費由上訴人負擔▲汪朱氏與鄭麟福因請求給付欠租及遷讓涉訟案（主文）被告應給付原告欠租洋一百八十元並遷讓出屋原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告負擔五分之一原告負擔五分之四▲大源營業公司與徐培棠因請求給付欠租及遷讓涉訟案（主文）被告徐培棠應給付原告欠租洋七十元並遷讓出屋原告其餘請求駁回訴訟費由被告負擔▲沈桂元與周春泉等因請求償還借欵涉訟案（主文）被告周唐生應給付原告借欵洋四百元原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告周唐生負擔▲王煥功與陳務道因請求給付欠租及出屋涉訟案（主文）被告應償還原告欠租洋七十五元並遷讓出屋訴訟費用由被告負擔▲沈鴻逸與顧玉祥等因請求給付欠租及遷讓法訟案（主文）被告顧玉祥應給付原告欠租洋四百元並遷讓出屋如無力償還欠租時應由被告瀾泰祥麻油店主顧煕寳負責代償原告其餘請求駁回訟費由被告顧玉祥負擔▲業廣公司與鍾耀三因請求給付欠租及遷讓涉訟案（主文）被告鍾耀三黃桂生應各給付原告租金洋一百五十元原告租與被告等瑞康里之房屋自本年五月份起到二十三年五月份止每月應各减免租金五元原告其餘请求駁回被告一部分反訴駁回本訴訟費應由原告負擔五分之一被告鍾耀三黃桂生共同負擔五分之三反訴訟費應由反訴被告負擔六分之五反訴原告負擔六分之一▲曹阿林與浦順發因請求給付欠租及遷讓出屋涉訟案（主文）原告之訴駁回訟費由原告負擔▲章鳳瑞與徐小法因請求債還貨欵涉訟案（主文）被告應給付原告貨欵洋一百五十二元訟費由被告負擔▲謝金財與王鳳清等因請求償還票欵涉訟案（主文）襊告王鳳清顧仲熙應連帶負責　還原告洋一百元訴訟費用由被告等連帶負擔▲公送送達一件黃元興與周志坤因欠欵案件本院定於十一月二十一日上午十時爲公開審理日期仰該被告遵期到院辯論母自延誤特此公示送達右仰被告黃坤坤知照▲李素珍與史興萬因離異案件本院定於十一月九日上午十時爲公開審理日期仰該被告遷期　院辯論母自種　特此公示送達右仰被告史與萬知照（以上十月二十九日）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The World Economic Conference is Again Uncertain <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The world is in an economic crisis. Since the summer of this year, there seems to be a shift. Japan is stimulated by its military industry and is devoted to war preparations. Its temporary prosperity is an exception. In the United States, since July, various industrial stocks have risen across the board. Taking the "United Copper Company" stock as an example, its market price has more than doubled in less than two months. Given this situation, it seems that the economic panic has reached its lowest point, and a gradual recovery is expected in the future. A second prosperity is within sight. However, what is the actual situation? This is worth our study.</p>
<p>At this critical moment of survival, China should concentrate all its efforts to save itself as a nation. This kind of vast and borderless problem, which has a relatively shallow relationship to us, is not what we are urgently concerned with. However, China cannot be independent of the world, and it cannot but have close relations with advanced capitalist countries. Therefore, changes in the general situation of the world indirectly and directly give our country a huge impact. Moreover, all countries are using China as the main target to relieve the current crisis and open up future markets. Can the world phenomenon or economic crisis not have a serious impact on our country? Since the economic panic occurred in 1929, the world production status (excluding the Soviet Union, based on 1928 production) was 90.8 in 1930, 77.3 in 1931, and 61.0 in the first half of this year. The drop in numbers in four and a half years reached 29 points. What is the severity of it? If we consider the advanced countries separately (based on 1928), the production of the United States is 53.2, the United Kingdom is 80.6, France is 73.4, Germany is 53.8, Japan is 107.5, and the Soviet Union is 206.1. Except for Japan and the Soviet Union, all of the above countries have shrunk. The reason why Japan has slightly increased is not a natural cause, but is due to active war preparations. The Soviet Union is outside the scope of capitalism and should be discussed separately. From the perspective of coal and iron production, in the United States, coal production (since 1929) has decreased by six-tenths, the United Kingdom and France have decreased by about two-tenths, Germany has decreased by about three-tenths, and Japan has also decreased by about two-tenths. Steel production in the United States is less than one-third of what it was five years ago. The United Kingdom has also decreased by one-half. France has also shrunk by half. Germany is also less than one-third of what it was in 1929. Japan can only maintain the status quo. As a result, the unemployed gathered. At first, they all sought their own way and never thought of international cooperation. They even tried their best to expand all contradictions between countries and worked hard on beggar-thy-neighbor policies. The more it evolved, the more dangerous the future became. The world's cash is now accumulated in the United States and France, and the degree of panic is increasing. The national economies of various countries are on the verge of danger.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, which was originally the leader in the world economy and the oldest of the modern advanced countries, must find a way to remedy the current crisis. If it can truly overcome the world economic panic, then all its own difficulties will be easily solved. Therefore, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill, when the British Parliament discussed the fiscal bill on May 10 this year, vigorously explained the necessity of the World Economic Conference. The main point of his argument was to maintain the value of gold coins and to make "currency stability" the most urgent task. At the same time, he advocated that the United Kingdom and the United States jointly initiate the World Economic Conference, and as a result of the consultation with the Special Council of the League of Nations on July 14:</p>
<p>"1. The League of Nations appoints a special committee to study current political and economic issues.</p>
<p>2. Mr. Simon is presumed to be the chairman of the special committee.</p>
<p>3. Under the special committee, there are two subcommittees, each with three financial experts as its members.</p>
<p>And seek assistance from the directors of the economic and financial departments of the League of Nations Secretariat.</p>
<p>4. Seek the participation of the International Labour Office and the Roman Universal Agricultural Association.</p>
<p>5. The League of Nations bears the cost of the meeting.</p>
<p>The above items are the concrete manifestation of the World Economic Conference. The United States not only expressed its approval, but also considered this to be one of the most important meetings in the world since the Versailles Peace Conference.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this conference, its purpose was only to stabilize the world currency, and other things were not taken into account. In fact, since the economic panic occurred, countries around the world have done their best to promote industrial rationalization, economic control of capitalism, and the implementation of currency inflation policies. Although exhausted, they have never grasped the opportunity for economic recovery, and they have not been able to achieve the regeneration of their own economic life. Therefore, this World Economic Conference is trying to coordinate the international currency inflation policy, attempting to support the rise in prices, and to reorganize the economic situation in countries where the gold standard system has collapsed, and to open up new paths for the future. Therefore, in addition to countermeasures for "currency stability," the agenda will also include discussions on "tariff issues," "foreign exchange issues," and even "reparations and war debts," and "silver price issues." Thus, the preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference will meet in London at the end of October. Then, will the World Economic Conference be able to succeed smoothly? In theory, although contemporary celebrities are eager for it to be accomplished in one fell swoop, to overcome the current crisis and restore past prosperity, the interests of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Japan, Germany, and Italy are inconsistent, and their positions are different. How can they be humble and frank about complicated issues such as currency stability, foreign exchange relations, tariff systems, and the gold standard, and eliminate prejudices based on their own interests and work together? Moreover, in recent years, national ideology has been extraordinarily strong, international cooperation has long been a thing of the past, and the current economic panic is an inevitable nature brought about by capitalism. It may be possible to perfunctorily gloss over and tide over the immediate difficulties. But to say that the World Economic Conference can break the current situation and open up a new situation, I am afraid that there is no such easy thing.</p>

<p>The Three Route Armies will withdraw as soon as the Military Department's order arrives</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng and others are responsible for supervising the troop withdrawal</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu talked about the measures for the withdrawal of the provincial army and the deployment of Liu's troops. Although it has been decided, it is now waiting for the official order from the central government. The provincial army intends to withdraw most of its troops to Pingdu and Changyi, and a small number of troops will be left in the seven counties of Penglai to assist in suppressing bandits. The Ludong militia is currently stationed in Wendeng and Rongcheng and can be completed on the 8th of next month. The supervisors sent by the central government, Jiang Bocheng is responsible for supervising the withdrawal of the provincial army, Xiong Bin is going to Yexian to supervise Liu's troops, and Gao Lingbai is going to Yantai to supervise the deployment of Liu's troops and is responsible for ensuring the safety of the provincial government administrative personnel and local people in the withdrawal area and that the local people are not disturbed. This task will only be completed after the withdrawal of the provincial army and the deployment of Liu's troops are completed. My actions this time are to relieve the suffering of the people, not for personal rights. Now that things are over, in order to avoid differences with the central government, I have decided to go to Wuhan to meet the President and ask for punishment myself. According to reports, after Liu is transferred away, a certain unit will be stationed. The central government has no intention of doing so at present. Even if there is, as long as it does not disturb the local area like Liu, I welcome it. During my two years in Shandong, I have resolved the problems of the people-disturbing troops and bandits of Xianzhen, Xue Fufeng, Liu Guitang, and Wang's cavalry division, all of which were to eliminate harm for the local area, not for personal rights. This time, the same is true for Liu Zhennian's troops, and I have a clear conscience, so I do not care about the hard work and complaints. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Liu Cunhou's troops arrive in Shunqing</p>
<p>Liu Deng and Tian, the three army commanders, meet for talks</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Fuxian and Shi Qingyang's plan to resolve Sichuan matters, it is heard that the content is based on the Outline for Governing Sichuan in the 17th Year of the Republic, and refers to the current methods suitable for eliminating the Sichuan war. The most important of the merged cases are two points: (1) There are more than 400,000 troops in Sichuan, which will be reduced to eight regular divisions. They must be completely in line with the organization of the National Army, be commanded by the central government, and must not expand their troops privately or act freely. (2) The Sichuan Provincial Government will be reorganized. Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou will all be members. The provincial chairman will be elected by the soldiers and civilians of Sichuan and appointed by the central government. Also, Dai and others believe that the method of resolving Sichuan matters should not be overly idealistic or too extravagant. A plan that is easy to implement should be formulated within the possible scope and carried out step by step, so as to achieve the goal of complete success. Otherwise, if only emphasis is placed on theory, it will be difficult to implement in practice, and the result will only increase local disputes. Furthermore, Sichuan is Sichuan of the central government and Sichuan of the entire China. The Sichuan army's struggle for cities and territories is by no means a local issue. It is heard that Dai Shi has scheduled to propose at the central political conference next week that the political conference formally designate personnel to compile a concrete method for governing Sichuan. Because the Central Political Council is the central hub for promoting politics, Sichuan is a part of the entire central government, so it should formally designate personnel to carefully formulate a method of governance, and the responsibility is undeniable. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The special committee for stopping the Sichuan war, organized by the Sichuan Fellow Association in Beijing, held a meeting today and decided: (1) Recognize the war as the head of the disaster and give a serious warning to Zi, and request the central government to telegraph and order the troops to withdraw to their original defenses and await handling. (2) Regularly invite the press to explain the significance of the special committee's organization and ask them not to be deceived by the military. (3) Re-telegraph Sichuan mass organizations to adopt various methods (such as strikes and resistance to donations) to shorten the war. (4) Seriously warn the military officers not to levy taxes and ask the central government to telegraph and order the troops to comply. (5) Send representatives to the central government to petition. (6) Solicit opinions on governing Sichuan from fellow associations and individuals in various places and compile a detailed plan book to completely resolve the Sichuan situation.

He and Dai both agree that the ten measures for governing Sichuan decided by the government in the 17th year of the Republic should be used as the basis and that the opinions of all parties should be added to them in the hope that they can be put into practice. He hopes that fellow countrymen living abroad and the people in Sichuan will fully support its implementation after the government decides on the measures in the future. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The petition representatives of the people of Xikang believe that the Sichuan situation is becoming increasingly serious and that the future of Kang and Tibet is fraught with danger.

(30th Special Telegram) (Chengdu) Liu Wenhui's and Tian Songyao's troops have withdrawn the警戒 lines outside the city to avoid misunderstandings.

<p>(Nanjing) A military agency received a telegram from Chengdu on the 29th stating that in order to carry out peace, Liu Wenhui not only voluntarily abandoned Shunqing, Suining, Tongnan, Jiangjin, Yongchuan, and other counties one after another, but also gave up Dazu without a fight on the 28th in the hope of avoiding the expansion of the war. In addition, the Provincial Yuan telegraphed on the 30th that since the 24th Army has repeatedly avoided war and respected peace, the people's hearts have become more and more secure. All sectors are preparing to form a war-ending group and plan to send representatives to Beijing to petition Liu Xiang to stop the war. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

It is a misunderstanding that he is about to take office, but the disputes in Sichuan have been long-standing, and it is necessary to resolve them thoroughly. (2) The armies in Shunqing recommended Yang Sen as the commander-in-chief and Li Jiayu as the deputy. The various units are advancing towards Suining. Deng Xihou plans to lead the entire division of the卖懲 to Suining to mediate, separating the two armies to avoid the expansion of the war. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Japan's Only Condition</p>
<p>Soviet Russia must first recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan, Torayanovsky, was lured by Japan and repeatedly telegraphed the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Bureau, Li Luonov, to approve the plan to sign the Japan-Russia Non-Aggression Treaty. Japan's only condition is that the date of signing the Japan-Russia Treaty must be after Soviet Russia recognizes the Manchurian Puppet Organization. The Puppet Organization has also recently told Russia that if Soviet Russia delays or refuses to recognize the Manchurian Puppet State, then the Puppet Organization will threaten not to protect the interests of Soviet Russia in Manchuria. Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative to Geneva, is on his way to Europe this time, bypassing Moscow, and has the important mission of promoting Soviet Russia's recognition of Manchuria and signing the Japan-Russia Treaty. The progress of this matter in recent days shows that the formal signing of the treaty may be possible in the near future, and after Japan and Russia sign the treaty, the recovery of the lost territory in Northeast China will inevitably have a considerable impact. In order to seek the integrity of our country's territory, in addition to the League of Nations advocating justice, it is only more effective to exercise the military force of the people. As for the plan of the Japanese Minister Ariyoshi's policy toward China, (1) Japan will not use military aggression against China for the time being, except for protecting the Manchurian Puppet Organization. (2) Effectively promote the situation of China's political unification, but only on the condition that China actually abandon the lost territory in the Northeast. (3) China-Japan issues outside Manchuria will be directly negotiated by China and Japan, and considerable concessions can be made, but the anti-Japanese movement in the Yangtze River area must be stopped.

<p>Italy is Skeptical, Britain Remains Silent</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 30th - After French Prime Minister Herriot briefly outlined France's new military reduction plan in the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday, various European countries heard about it and had different feelings. French officials praised the plan, Italy was skeptical, and Geneva openly considered it suspicious. London officials did not want to make any criticisms until they received the original text. It is heard that France's new military reduction plan is to strengthen the Kellogg-Briand Pact by determining a clear definition of the term "aggressor state." This plan has been approved by the French Supreme Defense Committee, but Herriot claimed in the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday that the acceptance of this plan is subject to several conditions: (1) The German national defense force must be disbanded if it is not organized according to the conscription system. (2) International co-management of national armaments and the right to inspect them. (3) European countries are free to conclude mutual assistance treaties to have a collective force to deter aggression. (4) The United States provides security guarantees. Many believe that Herriot's proposal implies that Germany can freely adopt the conscription law.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Germany is Angry but Tries to Remain Calm <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 29th - French Prime Minister Herriot's speech in the parliament on the issue of "building up armaments" has caused extreme anger here. However, officials are still trying to remain calm, saying that they do not want to make a definite judgment until the official speech manuscript has been received. However, based on what is currently known, there are many contradictions in Herriot's words. Furthermore, France has always advocated maintaining the dignity of the Treaty of Versailles, but it alone does not mention it now. It is very noteworthy whether its attitude has changed. As for the details of the French plan, Germany has no objection to abolishing the professional army, because it is not what Germany wants in its current form. Furthermore, with regards to the management of armaments, if all countries are subject to the same management without discrimination, then Germany will naturally not object. If France accepts Britain's invitation and participates in the London conference, then Germany's attitude towards various points can be known in detail. ▲Havas, Berlin, 29th - German government officials generally have a good impression of French Prime Minister Herriot's speech in the Chamber of Deputies and acknowledge that the French military reduction plan</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>is sufficient as a basis for future armaments negotiations. They believe that it is clearly not difficult for France and Germany to reach a compromise on all the main points of the French plan, or at least there is a possibility of a compromise. Their explanation is as follows: (1) Prime Minister Herriot advocated yesterday shortening the term of service for the German national defense force, which shows that France does not insist that there is no room for change in the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, the main point of the issue of amending the treaty has been opened up. (2) Herriot's proposal of a short-term military service system should be popularized to all countries. Germany has already made this request, which is in line with Herriot's advocacy. (3) Germany has no objection to the two items of international supervision system and search rights, as long as they are exercised mutually and uniformly. (4) On the establishment of an international army, the German side only has one condition, that is, before its establishment, the military systems of various countries must be unified. (5) Germany does not entirely reject the enrichment and popularization of the arbitration system. Apart from these five points, a few obstacles are unavoidable, such as when Germany accepted the 1928 General Arbitration Treaty, its intention was to make it possible to amend the treaty at all times, which is one of the obstacles. However, there is still a path for negotiations between France and Germany. Furthermore, although the Nationalist newspapers strongly oppose the French military reduction plan, the tone of official commentary is completely different, which is very gratifying.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Difficulties in Implementing the New Plan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 30th - The London Observer said that French Prime Minister Herriot's new military reduction plan has plunged Paris and the world into a fog. Germany will find it difficult to accept this plan because it will allow Germany's current comparative disadvantage to exist for several years. The newspaper also said that the main reason for the difficulty and danger of this plan is not the Franco-German problem, but the complicated Polish problem. Without this layer, the friendship between the Gaul and Teuton nations can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The French Proposal Still Includes Two Key Points and is Designed to Prioritize France's Interests <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 29th - The conditions set by France in its military reduction and security organization plan for acknowledging the shortening of military service, in addition to the six items telegraphed yesterday, still have two items that have not been reported. They are specifically supplemented below: (1) Relevant reductions in the army, navy, and air force. (2) Countries with territories overseas may retain special troops.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Taking into Account Both Britain and the United States <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 30th - A senior official closely involved in drafting the French military reduction plan told the Paris Reuters correspondent today about the relationship between this plan and Great Britain. It is said that Great Britain has no need to panic, because there is no question of restoring an agreement for compelled military resistance to a country under attack. As for the system of dividing territories and mutual assistance, it is not intended to ask Great Britain to join the East European Locarno Pact, nor is it intended to ask Great Britain to send troops to join a standing joint army to defend against aggression. This plan will also not hinder the army that Great Britain has prepared for use in the colonies, and it is expected that Great Britain will not adopt a compulsory military service system. The current international atmosphere naturally encourages Herriot to carry out his brave plan. It is expected that Herriot will present the main points of his plan at the Geneva meeting on November 3rd. British officials believe that the suggestions of US representative Davis can be used to formulate a method to allow Germany to participate in the Geneva Disarmament Conference again. Although no German representatives attended the meeting of the core group of the Disarmament Conference on Thursday, it is heard that German Foreign Minister Neurath will come to Geneva because of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The general public is aware that the final resolution of the disarmament issue depends on the results of the German elections. However, the German government's welcome of this plan is sufficient to show that the two sides in the Geneva arena are now gradually moving closer in a concrete way.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Washington, 29th - Newspapers here are commenting on France's military reduction plan in long articles, but there is no official declaration yet. The unofficial impression is that the French plan is the result of thorough research, which is in line with Hoover's advocacy of a one-third reduction and gives Geneva new hope for success. It is a "clever plan." It is also said that the French plan requests the United States to provide security guarantees, and the method is for the United States to consider on its own. This is a direct allusion to Secretary of State Stimson's declaration on the inevitable effect of the Non-Aggression Pact. The speaker then said that the United States is taking the opportunity of the Sino-Japanese conflict to show in fact that the country is willing to consult with other countries without hesitation, and also shows that although the Paris Non-Aggression Pact does not have provisions for mutual consultation, it can still achieve the effect of its application, which is no different from the provisions for consultation clearly stipulated in the pact. From this, it can also be seen that no matter what kind of treaty, if the consultation method is clearly included, the United States, based on its consistent principles, will not be happy to sign it. In addition, people in political circles said that whenever this issue is discussed, France has never explicitly asked the United States to give this guarantee, which is very gratifying.</p>

<p>The Executive Council May be Extended to Convene on the 8th</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 29th - After arriving in Paris, US Disarmament Representative Davis met with Prime Minister Herriot, and the discussion was about disarmament and security issues. The US representative asked Herriot to supplement and explain some points in Herriot's declaration in the parliament, and paid particular attention to the points directly related to the United States. After Davis bid farewell to the Prime Minister, he went to the Land Minister Peng Gu to inquire about the procedures to be adopted by the Disarmament Conference. Peng Gu seemed to think that in addition to consulting with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, the Disarmament Conference Presidium could meet on approximately November 8th. Peng Gu only verbally explained the general idea of the disarmament and security organization plan that France intends to propose, and a memorandum will be sent after Herriot returns to France from Spain.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 29th - Officials here have remained extremely silent about the recent talks between US Disarmament Representative Davis and British cabinet members. Sources in some quarters claim that although the views of Britain and the United States are approaching, the points of convergence are neither related to numbers nor a plan. The representatives of both sides have merely mutually agreed on a few concepts, which will be adopted as guidelines for future negotiations.</p>

Herriot declared with regard to rumors regarding the purpose of his trip to Spain: "Those who have prejudices, harbor malice, or do not understand things want to give this event an unnecessary explanation. In fact, there is no other intention for this trip except to express sincerity. Spain and France are both republics, and I hope that their existing friendship will become a sign and model of friendship between nations." Herriot then departed from here at 2:50 this afternoon and is expected to arrive in Madrid, the capital of Spain, at 9:15 tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>The Chairman Notifies Nagaoka by Telegram</p>
<p>The Administrative Council Meeting Postponed for a Week</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 31st - The League of Nations Council, which is reviewing the Lytton Report, is scheduled to meet on November 14th. However, according to a public telegram from Representative Nagaoka to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, Council Chairman Valera, the Irish Prime Minister, notified Representative Nagaoka that the Council was originally scheduled to meet on the 14th, but it can postpone the meeting by one week by the Chairman's authority. When will the Japanese government's written opinion arrive in Geneva? Depending on the date of arrival, it is planned to postpone the Council meeting to the 21st, hoping that Japan will reply quickly. After receiving the telegram, Foreign Minister Uchida discussed the matter with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As a result, he immediately telegraphed Representative Nagaoka, stating that the outline of the Japanese government's written opinion has already been taken by Representative Matsuoka and is expected to arrive in Geneva on November 9th. What Ambassador Yoshida is taking is only a correction of some parts of this outline. If the Council is eager to hold a meeting, the corrected parts can be notified by telegram, so Japan has no need to request the Council to postpone the meeting. However, if the Chairman must wait for the text of the written opinion taken by Ambassador Yoshida to arrive before holding the meeting, Japan will naturally not object.</p>

<p>▲ A dispatch from the Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, dated the 30th:  Recently, crimes under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police Department, such as the Omori shooting and dismemberment cases, have just been resolved.  However, it is reported that on the 16th, there was a three-person armed robbery, on the 26th, a murder case at the Akasaka Aoi Pavilion, the Omori murder and robbery case utilizing an empty house during the day, a broad daylight robbery of a large sum of money from a post office, an iron bar robbery at the residence of a school teacher in Koishikawa on the 20th, and on the 30th, a two-person robbery at the Ueno Lake Shrine.  These are all major murder cases, and the Metropolitan Police Department is overwhelmed. In addition, there are also intelligence crimes and doubtful cases, and the investigation department of the subordinate police stations are working day and night.  Considering that there are still many unresolved cases, Police Commissioner Fujinuma today, the 30th, distributed an encouraging message to subordinate police officers, urging a great effort from the entire police force.</p>

<p>Refusal of Moslem Leader's Request to See Gandhi</p>
<p>▲ A dispatch from Havas, Delhi, dated the 29th:  The Indian Governor-General has refused the request of the Muslim leader, Shaukat Ali, to visit Gandhi in prison. Mr. Ali is greatly disappointed and has launched a fierce attack on the attitude of the British authorities.  Nationalist newspapers in India believe that the authorities' unwillingness to reconcile Hindus and Muslims is evident in the Governor-General's refusal to allow Mr. Ali to meet with Gandhi.</p>

<p>▲ A dispatch from Reuters, Buenos Aires, dated the 29th:  Today, in the capital of Bolivia, the people staged an anti-government demonstration, attacking the Congress building and blocking the doors.  They then placed a large sign reading "For Rent" in front of the Congress.  The public's resentment towards the government is growing due to its failure in the war against Paraguay.</p>
<p>▲ A dispatch from Kuo Min News Agency, La Paz, dated the 29th:  The Bolivian Ministry of War announced today that the country's army will be reorganized, and General Kundt of Germany has been re-engaged to command it.  General Kundt previously reorganized the Bolivian army, but had left office not long ago.  Most of this army is not in the Chaco conflict area, as frequent government changes and the chaotic situation in the Chaco region have demoralized the military.  Therefore, General Kundt has been invited back to reorganize it. Mr. Kundt has replied and accepted the offer.  It is generally believed that the Bolivian government's re-engagement of a German military expert indicates that Paraguay's claims of military victories are credible. However, General Kundt's arrival in Bolivia is not for conducting warfare; at least temporarily, it will be a peacetime appointment, as both Bolivia and Paraguay have agreed to resolve the Chaco dispute through arbitration.</p>

<p>▲ A dispatch from Kuo Min News Agency, Boston, dated the 29th:  The Boston Foreign Policy Association of the United States, believing that the foreign policy of political parties is often overshadowed by domestic issues during election campaigns, invited the Socialist presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, today to speak on the party's foreign policy.  Mr. Thomas stated that the party's policy is based on seeking world peace and proposed six points: (1) immediately recognize Soviet Russia so that all countries can freely discuss the proposed peace issues; (2) organize the war debt issue at the World Economic Conference; (3) complete and real world disarmament; (4) strictly prohibit the supply of military materials and money to all aggressor nations; (5) end American dollar diplomacy; (6) stop all military education.  Mr. Thomas has been involved in the world peace movement for 20 years. During the European War, he strongly advocated conscientious objection and wrote books to explain his views.

<p>Papen and Braun Hold Conflicting Views</p>
<p>President's Mediation Fails</p>
<p>▲ A dispatch from Havas, Berlin, dated the 29th: Today, Papen, in his capacity as Administrative Commissioner of Prussia, and Braun, in his capacity as Prussian Prime Minister, were summoned by Hindenburg. The President's meeting with the two men was intended to mediate between them. However, the meeting did not go well. Braun fully acknowledged the ruling of the Supreme Court of Leipzig, demanding that the Administrative Commissioner appointed by the federal government only exercise his powers to the extent necessary to maintain public order. Papen, on the other hand, insisted on preserving the Administrative Commissioner's full administrative powers in order to carry out reforms in the Prussian administration. Braun also protested against the federal government's treatment of the Prussian cabinet members on July 20th. In short, the President's meeting with the two men failed to mediate between them and ended inconclusively.</p>
<p>▲ A dispatch from Kuo Min News Agency, Berlin, dated the 29th: The Bavarian state government has filed a protest with Federal President Hindenburg, stating, "If the federal government decides to interfere with the administrative reform of the Prussian state, it would be a serious violation of the constitutional position of the states in relation to the central government and between the states." Therefore, Bavaria wishes the President not to make a hasty decision before consulting with the authorities of other states. It is feared that the state of Hesse will soon take similar action. After receiving Bavaria's letter of protest, Hindenburg ordered Prime Minister Papen to notify the Bavarian state government that their conclusions and fears were based on a misunderstanding, as the federal government's actions were entirely based on the prerogatives granted to the federal commissioner by the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3 id="e60">US Wheat Surplus Problem <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Second in Importance Only to the Presidential Election</p>
<p>A Struggle to the Death with Canada in Sales Competition</p>
<p>▲ A dispatch from Kuo Min News Agency, Chicago, dated the 29th: The current price of wheat is even lower than it was during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Therefore, the United States and Canada are competing to sell their wheat before the harvests in Argentina and Australia in order to reduce surpluses and maintain wheat prices. This intense competition between the United States and Canada is a fight to the death. In the United States, the grain problem is second in importance only to the presidential election. Almost everyone is talking about the catastrophic drop in grain prices and speculating about the future. Whenever a price drop is telegraphed, it is accompanied by countless rumors. Some claim that Russia is facing famine and will buy American wheat, others say that China has agreed to buy more wheat than originally planned, and still others say that Canada has sent commissioners to China to negotiate the sale of grain. However, these rumors are often difficult to verify. The market situation is even more chaotic. Whenever the market price drops sharply at the opening, the bulls often sell off everything they own. Later, when rumors suddenly emerge, the bears, fearing that the market will rise, begin to cover their positions, and the closing price rises slightly. Today's wheat market is exactly the same. At one point, the December price fell to 40 and 7/8 cents, but eventually rebounded to 44 and 1/8 cents. However, according to statisticians, this price is equivalent to the lowest wheat price since the time of Queen Elizabeth I.</p>

<p>▲ A dispatch from Reuters, London, dated the 30th: The Observer today published an article by its special correspondent, strongly advocating that British diplomatic personnel in China should engage in more effective cooperation with consular personnel. The correspondent not only suggested that the personnel of the two departments in China should be closer but also suggested that consular personnel should be in constant contact with British industrial areas and British chambers of commerce. It is claimed that commercial and diplomatic affairs should be reorganized, with Shanghai as the central point. The correspondent believes that now is the most appropriate time to move the British Embassy to or near Nanjing. Regarding this, the correspondent suggested either building a temporary embassy on the vacant land within the British Consulate General in Shanghai, with the British Ambassador residing in the Consulate General's residence, or renting a suitable building in Shanghai and building a temporary embassy next to it. It is said that if this were the case, the British Ambassador would have to be involved in the Shanghai issue. The correspondent replied that it would be good for the British Ambassador to be in close contact with the British expatriates in Shanghai. This plan would also save the expense of the embassy guard in Beijing. Another solution would be for the British Ambassador to temporarily reside in the temporary premises prepared in Nanjing. However, this would be more expensive, as it would require finding new houses to accommodate the staff, while this would not be necessary in Shanghai. The correspondent also argued that Britain should cooperate with China, but this should not be confused with leniency. For example, the China Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees, because the agreement did not have sufficient provisions for verification and auditing, resulted in "unsatisfactory features." The correspondent also cited Sir Simpson's recent work in China as a good example of cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Zhang Fang Arrives in Jinan to Discuss Shandong Problems <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲ Rumors of Liu Zhennian's troops leaving Shandong by sea</p>
<p>▲ Han indicates willingness to withdraw defenses first if Liu leaves Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong problem has been delayed and unresolved. Chairman Chiang, considering the many years of friendship between 20th Route Army Commander Zhang Fang and Han Fuju, has specially sent him to Jinan to meet with Han to discuss a solution. Zhang arrived in Jinan by special train at 3:00 AM on the 26th, after departing from Hankou. He arrived in Kaifeng at 3:00 AM on the 27th. Because the Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, Liu Zhi, was also very concerned about the Shandong incident, he sent a telegram inviting Zhang to meet in Kaifeng. Therefore, after arriving in Kaifeng, Zhang disembarked to meet with Liu. He departed from Kaifeng at 11:00 AM. Liu Zhi's representative, Liu Yaoyang, came along. At 8:00 PM, they arrived in Xuzhou. Liu Yaoyang disembarked due to some business. At 11:40 PM, they departed from Xuzhou northward. Today (the 28th) at 11:40 AM, they arrived in Jinan. Most of the important figures here, from Han Fuju downwards, had worked with Mr. Zhang in Henan for many years, so there were many people who came to the station to welcome him. They included Civil Affairs Commissioner Li Shuchun, Finance Commissioner Wang Xiangrong, Industry Commissioner Wang Fangting, Education Commissioner He Siyuan, Zhang Yue of the Provincial Committee, Cao Liqing, section chief of the Department of Construction in place of the ill Department head Zhang Honglie, Zhang Weicun, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Li Wuchen, Director of the Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau, Gu Liang, Commander of the 22nd Division, Lei Taiping, Commander of the Handgun Brigade, Wen Chenglie, Mayor of Jinan, Wang Kairu, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and others. Han Fuju arrived at the station last. When the special train arrived, the military band played loudly. Zhang Fang, Liu Yaoyang, and Zhang's secretary general, Feng Baiping, and secretary, Liu Xingjie, disembarked amidst a grand welcome. Zhang first greeted the welcomers with "You've worked hard," and then, pointing at the people with a smile, said, "You've all come to Shandong; only I'm left in Henan!" Han also laughed and said, "You're the reinforcements!" They laughed together and then left the station together in cars to rest at the Jiaoji Hotel. I immediately went to the Jiaoji Hotel to visit Zhang and was received. The following conversation took place: (Question) Commander, this mission is very important. What are the details? (Zhang answered) There is no special mission. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the problem of Liu Zhennian's troops in Shandong. Because I have been friends with Chairman Han for many years, he asked me to come and take a look and meet with some colleagues and old friends. You could say it's half official and half private. (Question) What is the commander-in-chief's opinion on resolving the Shandong incident? (Answer) The commander-in-chief hopes for a peaceful resolution so that Shandong can return to peace and quiet. The commander-in-chief believes that Chairman Han is responsible for the security of Shandong. Therefore, the Shandong matter respects Chairman Han's intentions and has no specific preconceived notions. The goal is to ensure both the prestige of the central government and local security. (Question) It is reported that the central government has decided to transfer Liu Zhennian away from Shandong in order to quickly resolve the Shandong matter. Is this true? (Answer) The commander-in-chief's intention is to first stop military action so that the Liu Zhennian problem does not affect international diplomacy. As for transferring Liu away from Shandong, that is not a problem in itself. Don't overemphasize it. (Question) What are Han's views on this after the meeting with the commander? (Answer) How to proceed still requires detailed consultation with Chairman Han and instruction from the commander-in-chief before a decision can be made. I have not yet discussed Han's views. I will report back later. I also went to the provincial government to visit Han. According to him, he received a telegram yesterday from Director Tang (Xiang) of the Beijing Office, reporting that the central government had decided to transfer Liu's troops away from Shandong. Minister He (Yingqin) also sent a telegram, stating that he had decided to transfer Liu's troops away from Shandong and explaining the reasons and process of his telegram on the 19th (i.e., He's Hao telegram). Designating Yantai and Longkou as Liu's defense areas was to prepare for Liu's troops to leave Shandong from those two places in the future. The intention was very good. Vice Commander Zhang (Xueliang) sent a telegram, still advocating that Yantai and Longkou be temporarily garrisoned by a third party to facilitate Liu's transfer. I fully agree with this method because as long as Liu's troops leave Shandong, the suffering of the Shandong people will be relieved. I will comply with whatever. Now that the central government has decided to order Liu's troops to leave Shandong, the Third Route Army can withdraw first in order to resolve this matter as soon as possible. Zhang Boying (Fang) is here to discuss everything. However, Yantai and Longkou are inhabited by both Chinese and foreigners and are of great importance. It is best to order Commander Shen (Honglie)'s naval unit to be stationed temporarily in those two places so that they are familiar with the situation and no other accidents occur. One regiment of Ning's (Chunxiao)'s brigade of the provincial army currently stationed in Yantai and Li Xuande's cavalry brigade will arrive in Qixia today because there are Liu's defeated soldiers and bandits looting there, so they are going to suppress them. As for my resignation as chairman, it is because I feel that I lack political knowledge. Originally, when I took office as chairman two years ago, I only agreed to serve for one year. Now it has been more than two years, so I want to get rid of it. Chief Counselor Chiang (Bocheng) was the first person to mediate this matter. I ordered Director Liu (Xizhong) to go to Beiping and invite him to come to Jinan again so that everyone can discuss it together. Chiang telegraphed that he had already telegraphed the commander-in-chief for instructions and would arrive in Jinan in a day or two (note: Chiang telegraphed this afternoon, saying that he would arrive in Jinan early on the 29th). It is said that the central government may send a special commissioner to Shandong to supervise the withdrawal of the provincial army and to supervise Liu Zhennian's troops leaving Shandong by sea within a certain period of time.

<h3 id="e65">The Situation of the Tianjin Tram Workers' Strike Intensifies <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲ Traffic in the Italian and French Concessions is Severed</p>
<p>▲ The Company Authorities Adopt a Tough Stance</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The workers of the Tianjin Tram and Electric Light Company, because their seven demands to the company were not met, went on strike on the morning of the 21st, and there is still no proper solution. Since the strike, all workers have been able to ride the trams without tickets, and passengers have been unusually crowded, making driving quite dangerous. The authorities of the Italian and French concessions, believing that this would disrupt traffic order, have not allowed trams to pass through the two concessions since the 25th, causing the people great suffering. On the Japanese concession side, only four trams were dispatched to carry passengers back and forth, but not outside the Chinese areas. The remaining trams were arranged by the municipal government and the union to operate around the walled city and from Beidaguan to Dongfuqiao to prevent traffic disruption and to prevent other incidents. Yesterday, the concession authorities, seeing that the strike had been prolonged and unresolved, protested to the municipal government, requesting that it be stopped quickly so that the situation could return to normal as soon as possible; otherwise, the concession authorities would also be affected by the company's reduced income and should be held responsible by the municipal government. Mayor Zhou Longguang has paid little attention to local affairs. After the strike occurred, in accordance with labor-management mediation regulations, he ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to mediate. Little did he know that tram and electric lights are the largest public utilities in Tianjin and are operated by foreigners. When the contract was originally signed with Yuan Shikai, the Minister of the Northern Seas during the Qing Dynasty, there were special preferential treatments that were not comparable to domestic Chinese-owned factories and companies. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Director Li Ming, and the Public Security Bureau sent Section Chief Lu Wei to the company to mediate. The company not only refused to accept the workers' demands but also refused to mediate. Despite repeated persuasion, it was still ineffective. The two bureaus had no way to proceed and had to report the situation to the municipal government for review yesterday. The company's tough attitude is because it claims that it treats its workers very well. In February of this year, it gave everyone a raise. Usually, everyone takes two days off in rotation each month, and there are also seven public holidays, for a total of one month of rest each year. At the end of the year, everyone receives double pay, which is rare among other factories in Tianjin. Now that the workers have made demands, the company will not accept such insatiable greed, even at the cost of sacrifice. The only option is for the municipal government to stop the strike and protect the company's assets. Furthermore, when the company's board of directors met the other day, it also resolved to order the company to accept mediation. However, the board of directors is composed of directors hired by the company and appointed by the municipal government, including Chinese directors Zhou Longguang, Tao Jian, Shi Zizhou, and Zhang Ren, as well as Western directors Yan Huiqing, Zhang Boling, the manager of the Sino-Belgian Bank, and a certain Mr. Lin. They only have suggestions for the company and no power to make the company implement resolutions, which is completely different from ordinary boards of directors that hold real power. Therefore, all the company's operations, except for the company's general manager Wang Keshen's management, are telegraphed to the head office in Beijing for review in the event of special accidents. Currently, because the head office's reply and Wang Keshen's original intention are both unwilling to mediate, the strike is allowed to continue to spread, and the situation is becoming increasingly deadlocked. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezong, seeing that the municipal government has not made efforts to mediate this strike, has again ordered and urged it to be handled quickly. In addition to sending personnel to pay attention to investigating the strike and encouraging the workers not to take extreme actions, the municipal party headquarters resolved at yesterday morning's regular meeting to send another letter to the municipal government, strictly ordering the company to accept the workers' demands to avoid the expansion of the situation. In the afternoon, Zheng Wei, Shao Hua, and Shi Zizhou were sent to meet with Mayor Zhou to discuss solutions. Currently, Mayor Zhou Longguang, due to pressure from all sides, has specially summoned Lin Zixiang, the Chinese Affairs Director of the company, and Deng Qinglan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to the government to discuss solutions. The first step must be for the company to agree to mediate before the workers can be persuaded to resume work. As for the seven demands put forward by Xu, the company has not yet made any indication. The union believes that the seven conditions are very ordinary and hopes for a proper solution and is waiting for the authorities to mediate. (October 28)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Current Situation of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chen Weiyuan Dissolves He Xianzhu's Troops</p>
<p>▲ The 60th Division Advises Chen Guohui's Troops</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After He Xianzhu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the Third Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, was arrested in Shantou, fellow villagers' associations from all over Southern Fujian requested that the Pacification Headquarters send personnel to escort him back to Fujian to be interrogated together with Chen Guohui. Mr. He was escorted from Shantou on the 24th and will arrive in Fujian within a few days. Xinghua people in Fuzhou and Xiamen are collecting evidence in preparation for presenting it at the interrogation. As for the Third Battalion of the Third Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, which was concurrently commanded by He Xianzhu, its troops, such as the Wang Kui, Zhang Yuanjing, Jiang Xiang, and Zheng Ying battalions, were all bandits from Putian and Xianyou counties and have been disbanded by the brigade commander Chen Weiyuan. Only the Chen Tongliang and Ji Chuan regiments remain, one stationed in Putian county town and the other stationed in the Hanjiang commercial port. After reorganization, they will depart from Shuitaikou at the end of the month and go to Minqing and Gutian to take on defense duties along the Minjiang River. The Huang Bingwu troops of the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, originally stationed in Minqing and Gutian counties, have all moved to Pucheng to guard against the invasion of red bandits on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border.</p>
<p>Chen Guohui's troops of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army were defeated by the 19th Route Army in Xianyou. Led by Chen Peiyu, Commander of the Second Regiment, the remnants fled into the mountains bordering Dehua and Datian counties. Chen Peiyu is now in dire straits and has some regrets. In addition to Zhang Yan, Deputy Commander of the 61st Division, sending a letter to Chen, earnestly advising him to extricate himself and return, promising to preserve his life and give him an opportunity to rehabilitate himself and perform meritorious service, the 60th Division Headquarters also issued a proclamation, stating that if the soldiers of the brigade are willing to surrender, those who are foreigners can enlist in the local garrison of this unit and will be accepted. Those who are locals and have homes to return to will be given travel expenses of two yuan to escape and return home, and their self-employment will be protected in their hometowns to maintain peace and goodness. Those who return with weapons will also be rewarded as usual and will not implicate the innocent. However, when Chen's troops fled from Xianyou to Dehua, more than 2,000 guns were confiscated by the bandit Zhang Xiong'nan. The bandit, combined with the original guns, has a total of more than 3,000 guns, as well as many machine guns and artillery pieces. He occupies the Xishanshuikou area between Yongchun and Dehua and commits all kinds of evil. The 61st Division has sent troops to surround the area and force them to surrender their weapons and disband to avoid causing trouble in the area. (October 25)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Execution of Notorious Bandit Wei Baqun in Guangxi Province <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shot to Death by Clan Nephew in Bandit Lair</p>
<p>▲ Head Severed and Sent to Military Department for Reward</p>
<p>Nanning Dispatch: Wei Baqun, the communist bandit who disturbed Donglan, Fengshan, and the Zuoyou Rivers, killing countless people, has been apprehended. Since returning to Guangxi from Hong Kong in the 13th year of the Republic [1924], he has been actively recruiting bandits and buying off ignorant peasants and Yao people. He consolidated his party, occupied Donglan, and carried out massive killings, placing the people in dire straits. Although government troops were dispatched to suppress him, the mountains were deep and the forests dense, and Wei's bandits relied on various caves stretching dozens of miles as natural defenses. As a result, despite years of suppression, they could not be completely eliminated. When Yu Zuobai returned to Guangxi in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the tenacious bandits gained even more momentum, expanding their bandit army, burning and killing, causing extreme suffering. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi repeatedly received telegrams from the people of Donglan and Fengshan, requesting the dispatch of troops to suppress the bandits and relieve the people from their suffering and stabilize the region. Therefore, last month, they ordered the 7th Army Commander Liao Lei to supervise capable troops and conscripted militias to suppress the bandits and alleviate the people's suffering. After receiving the order, Liao led a large army from Liuzhou, marching day and night towards Donglan and Fengshan. Upon reaching Donglan, he launched a large-scale encirclement of the bandit dens, capturing more than ten bandit strongholds, seizing hundreds of bandit guns and thousands of dan [unit of weight] of bandit grain. However, Wei's bandits continued to resist stubbornly. When Bai Chongxi inspected Donglan, he instructed Liao Lei on strategies for suppression and capture. All army groups then exerted their utmost efforts in searching and suppressing, and the people also worked hard in cooperation with the army groups. Finally, yesterday (the 19th), Wei's bandits were killed. Upon hearing the news, the people were overjoyed. Liao Lei and Guo Fenggang, the chief of staff of the army, and Ma Yongliang, the deputy adjutant sent by the headquarters, have successively telegraphed Li, Bai, and the provincial government to report. The telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram from Army Commander Liao (title omitted): "Upon investigation, the rebel Wei Baqun has incited rebellion in Donglan and Fengshan for more than a decade, and his disaster has spread to the Zuojiang River, with more than ten thousand people suffering from his tyranny. The tragedy is unbearable to witness. Troops have been dispatched to suppress him repeatedly, and I, Liao, have also come to Lan [Donglan] twice to suppress him, but I have failed to eliminate the main enemy and relieve your worries and eliminate the local disaster. This time, our Deputy Commander personally came to Donglan to instruct on strategies for suppression and capture. All units have searched and suppressed according to the law, and the people have worked hard. Relying on the power and virtue of the Commander and Deputy Commander, Wei Ang, a farmer from Dongli, with a deep understanding of righteousness, came out of the cave to surrender. Following the instructions given to him, he seized Wei Baqun's Mauser pistol in Shuangfa Cave near Dongli this morning (the 19th) and shot and killed Wei Baqun, severing his head and sending it to the headquarters for reward. After verification by the people of Wuzhuan, they unanimously confirmed that it was true. Furthermore, Liang Yixiang, a gentleman from Wuzhuan, had a close friendship with Wei Baqun since childhood. He witnessed the scene and stated that the head was indeed Wei Baqun's. Further investigation revealed that Wei Ang is Wei Baqun's clan nephew and was trusted by Wei Baqun, which is why he was able to kill him. After inquiring, it is confirmed to be true. I hereby telegraph to report for your inspection and approval." (Liao Lei, Hao Chen, seal) at Wuzhuan.</p>
<p>(2) Telegram from Chief of Staff Guo (title omitted): "According to the telegram from Deputy Adjutant Luo Minhao of this headquarters, 'The bandit Wei Baqun was shot and killed by farmer Wei Ang from Dongli in Shuangdong near Dongli Village this morning (the 19th), and his head was severed and sent to Wuzhuan. Further details will be reported later.' I hereby telegraph to report." (Guo Fenggang, Hao Xu, headquarters seal).</p>
<p>(3) Telegram from Deputy Adjutant Ma (title omitted): "The bandit Wei Baqun has ravaged Donglan and Fengshan, brutally killing compatriots, and his crimes are heinous. Our army has been suppressing him since the ninth month of the lunar calendar [October/November] . The bandit has been fleeing everywhere. He secretly sneaked into Dongli Shangfanong last night and fell asleep with a Mauser pistol under his pillow. He was robbed of the gun and shot to death by Wei Ang from the same village. At 7:00 AM this morning, Wei Baqun's head was sent to the Wuzhuan militia headquarters for verification. The people have confirmed that he was indeed killed. Remaining bandit leaders such as Chen Hongtao are currently being searched for by four police squads led by Wei Ang. Wei's bandit has now been executed, which is truly due to the power and virtue of the government and the fortune of Donglan and Fengshan. " (Ma Yongliang, Hao seal), (21st).</p>

<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Anhui Province has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities in recent years. The social economy has collapsed due to the instability of the rural areas, all industries are in decline, and the people's livelihood is withering. Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces, previously sought to reverse the accumulated malpractices and encourage the people by issuing orders to all parts of the three provinces to strictly enforce the ban on opium. However, before a month had passed, the Hubei Special Tax Office suddenly sent personnel to Anhui to prepare for the public sale of opium. At that time, the Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner was ordered to inspect party affairs and traveled throughout the region. He witnessed widespread devastation and opium smoke everywhere, while the people's suffering was blocked from reaching the authorities. Therefore, he convened a meeting of party, government, and military leaders in Wuhu yesterday to discuss remedies. As a result, it was decided to telegraph to the central government, requesting it to order the Ministry of Finance to increase the import tax on foreign rice to raise the value of domestic rice. Another telegram was sent to the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish the Rice Grain Administration and the Rice Permit Tax, so that goods could flow freely and businesses could profit. Regarding the crackdown on opium public sales, a direct telegram was sent to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, requesting him to maintain the previous order and immediately order its abolition. The telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Party Headquarters: "Last year, Anhui Province suffered from a major flood, and the rural economy was on the verge of bankruptcy. This year, the autumn harvest has been completed, but the price of rice is low, and the farmers' suffering has deepened. Recently, the financial market has stagnated and cannot circulate, which has not only led to the decline of all industries and the impoverishment of the people, but also poses a hidden danger that may affect social stability. We were ordered to inspect party affairs in various counties and conducted a detailed examination of the situation in the rural areas, which was heartbreaking to witness, and our hidden worries are extreme. The underlying cause is the low price of rice and the financial hardship, while the low import tax on foreign rice, which floods the market, is the main reason for the decline in rice prices. If immediate relief is not provided, how can the people bear it? We hereby telegraph to your organization, earnestly requesting you to forward a letter to the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Finance to increase the import tax on foreign rice to raise rice prices, and to borrow a large sum of money from the Shanghai banking group to regulate the financial market, in order to maintain the people's livelihood and eliminate hidden dangers. We await your urgent orders."</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government (title omitted): "Lingyun et al. were commissioned by the Central Government to come to Wuhu to inspect party affairs. We have repeatedly heard from lower-level party departments and people's organizations that the establishment of a Rice Grain Administration in Wuhu to collect rice taxes is actually a disguised form of the old Rice Permit Tax. This kind of tax office disturbs merchants and harms the people, and the Central Government and the Ministry of Finance have already issued orders to abolish it. At a time when grain prices are low and rural areas are bankrupt, the imposition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies only exacerbates the suffering of merchants, and it hinders the smooth flow of goods. It not only affects the financial market, but also hinders the increase in rice prices. Therefore, we telegraph to your government, earnestly requesting you to deeply understand the people's feelings and immediately order its abolition to alleviate the people's hardship and maintain the financial market."</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Chairman Chiang (title omitted): "Opium is harmful, weakens the country, and destroys the race. Your Excellency has repeatedly issued strict orders to ban opium and promulgated regulations for a limited period of time to quit opium. All our people should follow this instruction in order to completely eliminate opium. We were commissioned by the Central Government to come to Wuhu to inspect party affairs. We have repeatedly heard from lower-level party departments and people's organizations that Yang Youxin, a special commissioner sent by the Hubei Special Tax Clearing Office, has recently established an inspection office in Wuhu to collect special opium taxes. Such actions violate the ban on opium, openly collect taxes, not only violate the Premier's instructions, but also greatly betray your Excellency's strict ban on opium, and disregard laws and regulations. We hereby telegraph to your Excellency, urgently requesting you to immediately order its abolition and thoroughly investigate and deal with it. We await your urgent orders." (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Representatives of Coal Industry in Jiangsu Counties Petition <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: Today (30th) at 10:00 AM, all the coal industry representatives from the counties came to the provincial capital to petition. The provincial chamber of commerce representative Liu Zhanbai, the Zhenjiang chamber of commerce representative Zhao Xianbo led the provincial coal industry petition delegation representatives He Hefang, Ding Chonglian, Lin Zhisun, Zhang Yuqi, Yuan Junsheng, Huang Bofu, Ma Buzhou and other seven people and all county representatives, a total of more than one hundred and several ten people first went to the provincial government to petition. The Secretary-General Jin Baoguang received them on behalf of the government. The representatives stated their petition which was that formerly the tax rate for coal, rice and flour was the same, one per thousand. This time the rice and flour rate was revised to two per thousand while coal was increased to five per thousand and draught animals were increased fourfold. Merchants cannot bear this tax burden. Also, in this province Nanjing, Shanghai and other places have not increased the tax rate and the Shanghai concession has no obligation to pay taxes. The difference in production costs is too great and affects the coal sales. Also, the representatives analyzed in detail the relationship between coal and the people's livelihood is more important than rice and flour. Jin agreed to forward this to Chairman Gu and wait for review. The representatives then went to the Finance Department to petition. The Secretary Yu Juesheng received them and asked them why Jiangsu was using the same tax rate as Zhejiang but Jiangsu's coal industry felt it especially difficult. The representatives responded that Zhejiang has a lot of mountains and forests and is very rich in firewood. Except for the coal used in factories, most people use firewood as fuel, so Zhejiang's total coal sales in the whole year does not exceed one hundred thousand. The province of Jiangsu has factories everywhere and all use coal as a primary fuel, so the whole year requires three million dan. Recently, Japanese coal is being vigorously dumped and all sales of domestic coal has been occupied. If the tax rates are increased then it will be difficult for the coal industry to survive, please transfer the special difficulties of Jiangsu Province. Yu agreed to wait until the director returns to the office and personally give it to him. Then the delegation went to the Industry Department and Secretary Hou Junliu received them. The representatives stated their difficult circumstances and said that coal is a necessary product for all kinds of industries. If you want to revitalize the industry, you must reduce the cost of coal in order to enrich the production. Please provide as much relief as possible. Hou agreed to transfer to the Director for the representative to find a way to solve it. Then the delegation together went to the Provincial Party and Zhang, the committee member representative received them and enquired in detail the coal industry's difficulties. The party representatives said that the coal and the four major elements of people's livelihood has a close relationship and that rice and noodles only relate to one part of the four major elements of the people's livelihood. The tax rate is still two per thousand. Coal is more related to rice and flour yet the tax rate has suddenly increased four-fold. This is affecting the national economy and the people's livelihood and requested a way to provide relief. Zhang agreed to raise the issue at the party and government meetings for discussion and give full assistance. The representatives thanked them and left.</p>

<p>▲ Provincial Committee Interrogation Determines They Were Principal Offenders</p>
<p>▲ Three Arrested for Colluding with Soldiers and Police at Jija Hotel</p>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: In the ninety-odd villages of the northwestern township of this county, incidents of burning houses have been discovered in recent days due to the Yangqing Tax Riot. Over the past two days, more than ten people have been arrested by the military and police and brought to the county. The two provincial committee members, Han Deqin and Li Mingyang, personally conducted strict interrogations. Six individuals, including Ge Guangxing (aka Ge Dayan), Chen Youxi (aka Chen Jintang), Luo Cailiang (aka Luo Pijiang), Yang Dechang, Liu Yushan, and Bu Dengyun, were identified as principal offenders. At 6:30 AM today (29th), Ge Guangxing and the other six were taken from the county government, their identities confirmed, and they were tied up and executed by firing squad outside the north gate near Longguang Temple. The charges were announced as follows: "It has been found that Jiangdu County has experienced incidents of gathering crowds and causing disturbances due to the investigation of field taxes. The Provincial Government has specially dispatched these commissioners to Yangzhou on the 25th to investigate and handle the matter. Over the past few days, we have repeatedly contacted and discussed with local figures, and the resolution of the Provincial Government's meeting on investigating field taxes pending further review has been announced. All blindly following offenders detained on the 23rd have been released on bail with leniency, and order has gradually been restored. However, on the 26th, a band of men suddenly gathered crowds, burned houses, and seized weapons in the northwestern townships. Military and police were dispatched to suppress the unrest, and several ringleaders who instigated and commanded the unrest were apprehended. It has been determined that they colluded with communist bandits, intending to take advantage of the opportunity to create chaos, which is unforgivable. They should be severely punished. In addition to Ge Guangxing, Chen Youxi, Luo Cailiang, Yang Dechang, Liu Yushan, and Bu Dengyun, whose testimonies are conclusive, being identified, verified, and executed by firing squad at the execution ground on the 29th of this month as a warning, the villagers in the other villages were coerced and blindly followed, and their circumstances are pitiful. These commissioners have reported to and been approved by the Provincial Government for general leniency and will not be pursued. They should all feel at ease, return home, and restore order. If anyone dares to fabricate rumors, gather crowds, burn houses, or seize weapons again, once verified, they will be arrested and charged as communist bandits and will not be spared. This proclamation is hereby urgently issued for the public to be informed." In addition, Chen Yongsheng and Chen Qiunian, whose circumstances were lighter, have been released on bail. Jiang Tingbao, Jiang Tingyan, and Jiang Tingkun are being held in custody by the Public Security Bureau. Last night, several thousand villagers gathered in the Jija Hotel area, attempting a riot. The 3rd Battalion of the Independent Regiment, led by Battalion Commander Wang, and the duty patrol team went to the scene to suppress the unrest. When their efforts proved ineffective, Battalion Commander Wang ordered the opening of fire, reportedly killing three people on the spot, injuring several, and arresting eight. The crowd dispersed. After interrogation by Battalion Commander Wang, three individuals, including Sang Rongjiu (village chief of the ninth district, one village), Hu Lazi, and Zhang Changxing, were found to be highly suspicious and were transferred to the county government by the police today. The other five individuals were released that night. This morning, the county detective team arrested Zhang Yuting in Hujia Square. It is reported that the villagers have dispersed somewhat. Director Li also transferred the security team stationed at Taiyang Palace to Ping Shan Tangzhen this afternoon to maintain order. Around 4:00 PM this afternoon, the two provincial committee members, Han and Li, invited reporters from this city to the River Works Bureau to make a statement, which was generally divided into the following points: (1) The causes and changes of the recent unrest (based on the interrogation results and what was personally witnessed by various parties); (2) The government must take decisive action (execution of principal offenders and release of offenders); (3) Measures to suppress the unrest in the future (still need to guide and appease); (4) The removal of the county magistrate (because County Magistrate Yang is unsuitable, he is planned to be removed in the shortest possible time); Hopes for the press: A, remain calm and do not amplify the propaganda; B, align the spirit with the government; Whether there is any corruption by the Yangqing tax personnel has not been verified at this time, but attention will be paid to it in the future, etc. It is reported that the county party headquarters convened a discussion with various people's organizations this afternoon, and the results decided: (1) Telegram to the Provincial Government, requesting that the two provincial committee members, Han and Li, be stationed in Yangzhou to maintain order until the Yangqing Tax Riot subsides; (2) Telegram to the Provincial Government, requesting an increase in troops to Yangzhou for defense.

The factory site is planned to be located on Zhongshan Mountain in Taihu Lake, Wuxi, to avoid danger. A staff member was once sent to Wuxi to survey the site, but the matter was shelved due to funding and other issues. Recently, Chen Yi, Vice Minister and Director of the Ordnance Department, considered that the Sino-Japanese and January 28th incidents showed that nitric acid factories were necessary, so the former days he was accompanied by British consultant Gulao, chief technician Hong from the Ordnance Department, and secretaries and guards, a group of seven or eight people, to come from Beijing by car to Wuxi.

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office, because the province's education funds have been designated as taxes from teeth traders and slaughterhouses, to be collected and remitted as much as possible. There is a clear distinction between these funds and other government expenses. However, because the land tax is collected as a whole, the dedicated education funds are not separated and stored separately at the time of collection.

Recently, it was found that the amount of arrears owed by various counties is increasing year by year, and the provincial and departmental education funds are in a precarious state.

<p>The sensational Shanghai Fourth Public Amateur Games opened yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. Because of the large number of participants and the variety of sports programs, and because it had to be completed in one hour, awards were not given at economical times for the various competitions. Therefore, the judges arrived at the field very early, and after completing the 100-meter preliminary round before the opening ceremony, the entire team lined up and entered the field to perform the opening ceremony. Then, Mayor Wu, the chairman, gave a report, stating that individual life is limited, and the ambition is infinite and great. The completion of a great ambition depends on a sound spirit. A sound spirit is formed by physical exercise. This is the purpose of holding the Public Amateur Games, and you should also encourage yourself with this. Then, Director Pan, the president of the association, gave a report. After the representative of the Municipal Party Department, Cai Hongtian, gave a speech, the sports began.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Hard Court Tennis Tournament, Yu Tianguang Shows Promise <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲Defeated Strong Enemy Shi Guiya Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Liang Deguang Defeated Crawford</p>
<p>▲The Two Will Compete for the Final</p>
<p>The Hard Court Tennis Championship organized by the French Chamber of Commerce was in its second day yesterday. In the men's singles, the interest was concentrated on the group of Yu Tianguang vs. Shi Guiya. Shi is a strong player from the American community, and it was difficult to distinguish between Yu and him. As a result, Yu won the right to the second round with a score of 7-5, 4-6, 6-2. At the same time, in another group, Liang Deguang won the right to the second round with a score of 6-1, 6-0 against Crawford. Yu Liang will meet in the second round. The competition will continue from Saturday.</p>
<p>▲Yu Tianguang's victory over Shi Guiya, the victory or defeat of the two depends entirely on the level. Both sides fought with long strokes, but Yu's shots were hard and powerful. Shi touched the net a lot. Yu also gathered all his strength and finally defeated the enemy. In the first set, Yu won two games with a clean four-game winning streak, and then Shi got two games, four to two, and then four to four. Yu won five to four, and Shi leveled again. Yu finally won the first set with seven to five. In the second set, Shi led with four to two and five to three, and made it one to one with six to four. In the third set to determine the victory or defeat, Shi took the lead with two to one, but lost five games in a row and was defeated by a score of six to two.</p>
<p>▲Liang Deguang's victory over Crawford, Crawford was not a strong opponent of Liang. In the two sets, Crawford only won one game, six to one, six to zero, completed in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>▲The situation of the men's singles, at the moment, there is a trend that Chinese people will monopolize the singles. Yu Tianguang, Liang Deguang, and Sun Linfang have all entered the second round. The other one is none other than Bellings. In the Yu Liang second round, Sun will play the fourth person in the second round. Based on past achievements, Yu Tianguang has the most hope of winning the championship. ▲There is fierce competition in doubles. Among the doubles, the four strongest teams are: (1) Zheng Zhaojia and Jiang Daozhang, (2) Shi Guiya and Shi Misi, (2) Canafanvalo and Tafolasi, (4) Bellings and Meyers. Teams (2) and (4) have already won the right to the second round. Zheng Jiang still needs to fight the Huite and Gormay team, and then meet the two Shi. Kanafanvalo and the younger Ta will probably win, and they will meet Bei Mei in the second round. Zheng and Jiang need to be careful and there is hope for winning the championship. However, Bei and Mei, one tall and one short, are also very scary.</p>
<p>▲Lin Baohua joins the mixed doubles. Among those related to the Chinese, only Lin Baohua and Mrs. Mantemor are paired and joined the mixed doubles. There is not much hope. There are strong opponents Canafanvalo and Ke Lasha group, and Bellings and Fojieshi (the current Shanghai women's singles champion group, etc.). In women's singles, Fojie and Ke Lasha have hope. In doubles, the strength is scattered.</p>
<p>▲The competition will continue on Saturday, starting from this Saturday, November 5th (Saturday), 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, for five consecutive days, and will end on the 12th and 13th.</p>

<p>—Zhou Xianyan Team Wins 5-2—</p>
<p>—The Performance of the Chinese Players Was Very Outstanding—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Port Team Football Team held its first trial match at Yiyuan at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. There were about 10,000 spectators, which was a great event. As a result, Zhou Xianyan's team defeated Gaxu's team 5-2. Both teams performed well, and the interest was strong. All the skills were fully demonstrated. I am very satisfied with the appreciation. The process is recorded as follows</p>
<h3 id="e102">(1) Brief Description of Football Skills <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhou Xianyan Team Zhou's left inside forward Turner did not play.</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang from Donghua replaced him. The forwards of this team did not seem to be as sharp as those of Gaxu. However, yesterday's performance was completely different. The shooting was almost good, and the connection was also wonderful. Especially Chen Jiaqiu's ferrying in all directions was the most effective. Laudon and Chen Hongguang also reached the top. The most sophisticated were the defenders. Zhou Xianyan's goalkeeper need not be criticized again. Li Ning and Feng Yundong, the two inside defenders, were as solid as iron, unbreakable, well-positioned, and controlled. The ideal Gaxu team forwards could not cross the Leichi line. On the central defender side, Xu Yahui was the most prominent, running all over the field, taking care of all directions, and responding in all directions. His skills were far above those of Gaxu. He was the most prominent of the three with Li and Feng yesterday. Right winger Huisiwu was also very commendable, followed by Madaci. In short, Zhou's defense was far above that of Gaxu. It was no accident that they won 5-2.</p>
<p>▲Gaxu Team Gaxu's performance was unexpected. In the first quarter of an hour after the start, they were very brave. The forwards pressed Zhou's team tightly, making Zhou Xianyan busy with rescue. Fortunately, they did not lose. But from then on, they were at a loss, and Chen Rong was scattered, making it difficult to peep. In addition, Zhou's team had a tight defense, which was impeccable. Li Yichen's performance was quite regressive compared to before, and his actions were slow and his feet were inaccurate. The biggest problem was that he could not cooperate with others, so Li did not see any outstanding performance yesterday. Chen Zhenhe often had the impression of isolated applause. The defenders were far inferior to Zhou's team, and there were no outstanding performances.</p>
<h3 id="e103">(2) Competition Process <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>▲First Ball Gaxu team kicked off and attacked fiercely. The forwards were very brave. Zhou Xianyan belonged to the brink of danger, punching and kicking. Fortunately, the frame was raised properly, and the dragon gate was preserved. After twenty minutes, Zhou's team sent troops to attack, Jiaqiu Hongguang and Laudon fought in close quarters, broke through the defense line, Laudon succeeded in one fell swoop, very clear and powerful.</p>
<p>▲Second Ball Gaxu team was kicked in front of the goal for a free kick. Zhou's team Xu Yahui kicked very well. Goalkeeper David saved it. After this wave was flat, five or six minutes later, Zhou's team made a comeback. Laudon went on a rampage and broke the dragon gate again, making it two to zero. This is the result of the first half</p>
<p>▲Third Ball About three minutes after the start of the second half, Zhou's right winger Fafan timidly reached the bottom line, and sent the ball to the center, Gaxu's front gate, quite a desolate scene, Chen Hongguang headed the ball properly, and the header entered the door, the situation was very beautiful, making it three to zero</p>
<p>▲Fourth Ball This ball was also headed in by Chen Hongguang, thanks to Chen Jiaqiu's remote transfer, Hongguang can be said to be good at using his head, the ball's entry, only two or three minutes away from the third ball</p>
<p>▲Fifth Ball After Zhou's team won the fourth ball, Gaxu's team kicked off in the center, and went all the way down, Chen Zhenhe, Li Yichen, Burns, shoulder to shoulder, directly into the enemy camp, after a considerable amount of time, Chen Zhenhe attacked the goal, and the ball entered the net, Gaxu's team then recorded, making it one to four</p>
<p>▲Sixth Ball Zhou's right winger Huisiwu, kicked a free kick against Gaxu's goal. The ball flew to the front of the goal. Laudon headed it, and the ball went to the right. David wanted to save it but failed, and the ball was obtained by Chen Jiaqiu, who shot it quickly, making it five to one.</p>
<p>▲Seventh Ball Suddenly saw Li Ning injured in the ear, Zhou Xianyan could not pay attention to the situation of the ball because of taking care of Li, so the interior was empty, and the Dragon Gate was shaken, Gaxu team Li Yichen dribbled in and succeeded in one fell swoop, sending the result to five to two, Zhou Jiayan team won</p>
<h3 id="e104">(III) Reflections on Watching the Game <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was only the first trial match, and the official lineup is still difficult to determine. It will take a second or third rehearsal before a decision can be made. The gentlemen in charge have their own insightful views on selecting talent. Here, I will briefly describe what the reporter observed yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Goalkeeper and Inner Defense: In the goalkeeper battle, Zhou Xianyan is unmatched in Shanghai. There is no doubt that he should be selected as the official player. In terms of inner defense, Li Ning and Feng Yunyou are capable and handle things properly, without any flaws. Based on yesterday's observations, Li and Feng are also the only candidates for the official team.</p>
<p>▲ Midfield Talent: The most difficult problem in midfield is Xu Yahui and Gan Xu. Gan Xu serves as the captain of the trial matches and has been the captain of the Shanghai Port team in previous years. It is inevitable that he will be selected as the center midfielder. However, this gentleman has not performed well in any of the previous competitions this year, and yesterday was no exception. On the other hand, Xu Yahui, who came to Shanghai from Malaya, is currently the leading midfielder in Shanghai, rarely surpassed. His performances yesterday and in the past have been outstanding, unmatched by Gan Xu. There is a real possibility that he will be selected for the important position of official center midfielder. However, Gan Xu has higher seniority and is related to the reputation of Westerners. Although his skills cannot surpass Xu, it is difficult for Xu to seize Gan Xu's position. If they have to settle for second best, Xu might be used as the left or right midfielder. As for the other midfielder, Whiswood seems to have the highest chance of being selected.</p>
<p>▲ Forward Lineup: The forward lineup is difficult to arrange. Looking at yesterday's situation, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Zhenhe, Chen Hongguang, and Lawton were the best, followed by Fafanqie, Alger, Wan Xianghua. Wan is short and weak, making it difficult for him to cope with strong opponents. Fafanqie was the best winger yesterday, but his footwork is a bit slow, which is a pity. With the above talents, Lawton can be the center forward, Hongguang can be the left inside, Jiaqiu can be the right inside, Zhenhe can be the left winger, and Fafanqie can be the right winger. If Li Yichen can use all his energy to achieve good results in the second trial match, it is not difficult for him to be selected.</p>
<p>The above is just the reporter's humble opinion and may not be appreciated by knowledgeable people. This matter is important, and the selection committee has its own insightful views and will arrange the most complete and strongest lineup. Yesterday's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Xianyan's Team</p>
<p>Alger</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Li Ning Xu Yahui Turner Lawton</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Whiswood Chen Jiaqiu Fafan Fa</p>
<p>▲ Gan Xu's Team</p>

<p>On October 23rd and 25th, slogans damaging the reputation of our school were found in Huangdu Town. They were neither done by students nor related to Mr. Chen Yunshan. Zheng Tongzhi came to Huang to accompany Director Xiang of the Education Department to inspect the industrial work experimental elementary school. At that time, he strongly criticized the recklessness of the Jiading Sixth District Security Regiment and did not say that the students' actions were childish. Moreover, on the afternoon of the 25th, the deputy head of the regiment, Zhang Jinting, came to the school to apologize. At that time, Mr. Zheng Tongzhi and Director Xiang of the Education Department were both present, and there was no mutual apology. As for the emblem on the slogan, it is completely different from the true emblem of the student union, which is obviously forged by villains. Because the rumors are untrue, we hereby send a special letter to correct them. Shen Zhengyi, Executive Secretary of the Student Union of the Huangbo Rural Normal School of Jiangsu Province, October 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Zeng Zhongming Returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday Morning <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Go to Beijing by Night Train Tonight</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, accompanied Mr. Wang Jingwei on the Andes Lloyd ship to Hong Kong because of the latter's trip abroad. Mr. Wang did not land due to illness and continued his voyage to Europe for medical treatment on the original ship. After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Zeng stayed briefly and then returned to Shanghai on the French postal ship Mesange. The ship docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf at around 11:00 AM yesterday morning. Mrs. Zeng Zhongming, Ms. Fang Junbi, and others were there to welcome him. After landing, he went directly to Wang's residence on Xipu Shilu to rest. Mr. Zeng is scheduled to go to Beijing by night train tonight. Mr. Zeng's conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency on the ship is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Wang Arrived in Saigon: According to Mr. Zeng, Mr. Wang took a three-month leave from the central government to go to Europe for treatment due to a tropical disease. When the ship passed through Hong Kong, he also did not land due to illness, but only met with Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and other representatives on the ship. He himself could not send him far due to official duties, so he landed in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai on this ship. Mr. Wang had safely arrived in Saigon on the 28th, as he himself received a telegram from Mr. Wang from Saigon while in Hong Kong. As for which country Mr. Wang will go to for treatment after arriving in Europe, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>▲ Very Sorry About Nanhua: Regarding the text involving Muslims published in Nanhua Literature and Art, Mr. Zeng expressed his deep regret. He said that he had entrusted a friend to act as the editor of Nanhua Literature and Art because he was busy with departmental affairs, which led to this lack of scrutiny. He believes that the tenets of Islam are pure and have always been admired by him. This incident was not intended to be an insult, and he hopes that all sectors will understand this.</p>
<p>▲ Attendance at the Geng Meeting Undecided: The reporter also inquired about the Ministry of Railways borrowing money from the Central Geng Fund Committee to complete the Yuehan Railway and the Tongguan-Xi'an section of the western section of the Longhai Railway, and asked whether the vice minister would attend the meeting nearby to explain the matter, as the committee has now telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting it to send a representative to the meeting to explain. Mr. Zeng replied that he had just returned to Shanghai and had not yet decided.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Representatives Returning to Shanghai After Supporting the Covenant and Going to Beijing <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲ Active Establishment of Branch Associations in Beijing, Tianjin, and Other Places</p>
<p>▲ Establishment of Various Industry Affairs Departments</p>
<p>In order to concentrate the strength of merchants across the country and expand the economic blockade organization against Japan, the Shanghai Association for Supporting the League of Nations Covenant sent representatives to various parts of the country to contact and organize branch associations. It is reported that the representatives who went to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places along the line, including Zheng Chengqing, Luo Qinghua, Xie Zhongle, Lu Wenshao, and Yao Jiaxing, returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their missions. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Zheng Chengqing yesterday. According to him, the results of the contact with various places were quite satisfactory. Business leaders in various places are willing to implement an economic blockade against countries that have invaded our country's territory based on the principle of free trade. Places along the Beijing-Shanghai line, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Su, and Xi, had already begun preparations before the representatives arrived, and have recently been actively organizing branch associations. It is expected that the organization will be widespread in various places along the Beijing-Shanghai line soon. This time, the chambers of commerce of various provinces in Jiangsu happened to be holding the People's Food Coordination Conference in Zhenjiang. Representatives from various chambers of commerce gathered in Zhenjiang. After contacting the representatives, they all expressed their sympathy and willingness to proceed unanimously. The reporter then inquired about the organization of the various industry affairs departments in the city. According to the reply, the various industry affairs departments in the city are also actively organizing. Those that have reported their establishment include the Sugar Industry Association, the Paper Industry Association, the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association, the North-South Goods Exchange Association, the Silk Industry, and more than 50 other industries. More than 10 foreign chambers of commerce, such as the Hankou Yarn Industry Association, have also sent telegrams reporting their establishment.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Representatives Returning to Shanghai after Petitioning on the Reform of Customs Administration Issues <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ Luo Qinghua Makes a Statement</p>
<p>More than ten representatives, including Lu Wenshao, Luo Qinghua, Tu Kaizheng, Zheng Chengqing, and Xie Zhongle, who were sent by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations to petition in Beijing on customs administration issues, returned to Shanghai last night after being delayed until last night. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially inquired about the process and received a detailed reply from Mr. Luo Qinghua, a representative of the petitioning delegation, who expressed his views on the case. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Petition Process: The representatives arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 27th and went to the Central Party Headquarters, where they were received by Committee member Ye Chucang. Mr. Ye deeply regretted that the lack of appropriate laws and regulations in customs administration had led to the current disputes. He believed that the points requested by the Shanghai merchants were essential and agreed to submit them to the Central Political Committee for discussion. He also said that Shanghai's industry and commerce were extremely depressed after the One-Two-Eight Incident, and the central government was deeply concerned. It was planning how to maintain the status quo and could not bear to see further destruction. Therefore, although the Central Party Headquarters is not a direct administrative organ, it would base its decisions on the principle of full sympathy and send a letter to the National Government, ordering the competent authorities to investigate and correct the situation. The representatives were satisfied. They then went to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, where they were received by Director Zhang Yichou of the Commercial Department because Minister Chen had gone to Ma'anshan to survey mines. They were received by Director Peng Xuepei of the General Affairs Department at the Executive Yuan. All of the points in the petition were fully accepted. Director Peng also said that the customs would absolutely apply the Administrative Procedure Law. If merchants suffered losses due to excessive fines or illegal searches, they could file complaints with the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to recover the losses. Yesterday, they went to the Ministry of Finance, where they were jointly received by Vice Minister Li Tiaosheng and Section Chief Wu of the Customs Administration. After the representatives stated their petition, Vice Minister Li said that the Ministry of Finance had not heard of the recent actions taken by the customs in Shanghai. Section Chief Wu explained that the scope of the customs' authority to search merchants' goods was limited to the customs location and the customs offices that had been registered with the customs. As for breaking into stores to search, the Customs Administration was also surprised to hear about it. He asked the representatives to tell the affected merchants to report the facts truthfully, and the Ministry of Finance would definitely investigate the matter impartially. The people's absolute right to apply the Administrative Procedure Law to customs is unquestionable and the tariff law is also being drafted, but it is a major matter and cannot be completed overnight. At the Legislative Yuan, they were received by Secretary-General Zhang Weihan. Mr. Zhang believed that the establishment of a tariff law would not only provide merchants with laws to follow and be protected, but also reduce malpractices and supplement national revenue. He agreed to submit it to the meeting for discussion and to engage in drafting it. The representatives then went to the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce to inform them of the process and then went to Zhenjiang in the afternoon. The Jiangsu-Shanghai People's Food Conference was held in Zhenjiang, and representatives from various chambers of commerce in Jiangsu Province attended the meeting. They were informed of the recent actions taken by the Shanghai Customs and the petition process, and they all expressed their deep sympathy and agreed to advocate for a unified position. The representatives completed their missions and returned to Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Statement: Luo Qinghua, Executive Committee member and Director of the Commercial Department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was one of the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce who went to Beijing this time. When asked about his views on the case by the reporter, Luo replied that customs duties are a legitimate national revenue and the duty that the people should bear. Tax evasion directly damages the national treasury, and indirectly allows unscrupulous people to take advantage of loopholes, causing the market to lose its balance, which is particularly harmful. As for how tax evasion occurs, the causes are far-reaching and the situation is complex, which cannot be explained in a few words. The significance of our petition this time is to establish a tax law and fundamentally eliminate the malpractices of tax evasion. Customs officials are paid by the state and should fulfill their responsibilities. If a large amount of smuggling occurs, the customs officials should at least feel guilty. However, the customs should exercise its authority within the limits of its name, that is, within the customs. Even if we take a step back, it can only investigate the importer with the responsibility of paying taxes and obtain proof of taxpayer qualification, but it cannot conduct searches in Chinese stores that sell retail. According to the words of Section Chief Wu of the Customs Administration, it can be seen that searching stores is indeed unfounded. Article 10 of the Provisional Constitution states that "The people's residences shall not be entered, searched, or sealed without legal basis." When the customs searched the Shichangtai Watch Company on August 31, it is said that they did not show a search warrant at that time. It was not until September 2 that the Customs Commissioner sent a letter to the First Special District Court through the Customs Superintendent. The customs is a national tax collection agency, and customs officials are government employees. Our country is a country ruled by law. If customs officials are outside the law, how can merchants and the people have nowhere to turn? The main cause of this phenomenon is the lack of specific laws and regulations for customs duties. For example, there is a Consolidated Tax Law for the consolidated tax, a Business Tax Law for the business tax, and a Salt Tax Law for the salt tax. However, the customs duty, which is the largest source of national revenue, lacks legal regulations, which is a pity. Fortunately, the Yuan and ministries have expressed their intention to start drafting laws, and the Administrative Procedure Law has also been applied to customs. Therefore, merchants and the people will have protection and remedies in the future. Merchants and the people in Shanghai have always taken it upon themselves to be patriotic and law-abiding, and they should encourage each other to avoid being used as a pretext.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Shen Shuyu Came to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ To Discuss Measures to Prevent Tax Evasion</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has recently stated that there are no specific laws and regulations for customs administration. Customs officials, restricted by procedures such as consular visas for foreign merchants, do not fully exercise their authority when goods are imported, nor do they investigate foreign firms that directly order goods. Instead, they conduct searches on Chinese merchants who have transferred goods repeatedly, and even lead a large number of armed detectives to guard stores and detain merchants' goods, causing great pain to merchants and the people throughout the city. The representatives of the chamber of commerce and various industries, including Lu Wenshao, Zheng Chengqing, Jin Runxiang, and Luo Qinghua, went to Beijing on the evening of the 26th to petition the central government, requesting that customs officials be prevented from searching stores and that illegal penalties by customs be promulgated. After receiving the presentation, the Ministry of Finance specially sent Shen Shuyu, Director of the Customs Administration, to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. It is said that Mr. Shen is scheduled to meet with representatives of various industries in the city within a few days to discuss proper measures to prevent tax evasion and investigate the situation of forced searches by customs officials in order to stop them.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Zhu Tingqi Came to Hubei to Inspect Salt Affairs <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ Significant Progress Has Been Made</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Tingqi, Director-General of the Salt Affairs Audit Office, along with Chief Inspector Zeng Yangfeng, passed through the Pinghan Railway and arrived in Hubei from Henan. In recent days, he has personally visited the Hubei Coast Audit Office, the Hubei Coast Transport Bureau, the Hankou Weighing and Releasing Office, the Tax Police Bureau, the Hanyang Salt Warehouse, and the wheel transport wharf for on-the-spot inspections, and has given additional encouragement to the employees of various institutions. It is reported that the salt affairs on the Hubei coast have made significant progress since the merger of administrative agencies. The annual expenses have been reduced by nearly 300,000 yuan, and the tax revenue for the first nine months of this year has increased compared to the same period last year. The various bad practices of salt merchants and Huai salt merchants have been completely eliminated, and the prices of both refined salt and Huai salt have been reduced as a result. The procedures for transporting salt have been simplified, the efficiency of public affairs has been greatly improved, and merchants and the people have felt more convenient. It is also reported that as a result of the inspection by Mr. Zhu and others, there are concrete plans to prohibit private smuggling and promote legitimate salt sales, which will be implemented soon. It is also reported that Mr. Zhu and others will go to Changsha to inspect within a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Establishment of the National Joint Conference of All Circles for National Salvation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>With the Japanese army invading our Eastern Provinces, national sentiment has been boiling. The National Joint Conference of All Circles for National Salvation, initiated by national salvation organizations from various provinces, held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 9:00 AM at the Zhou Family Garden on Jing'an Temple Road. A total of 102 representatives from various provinces and cities, including Long Xiangsan, Zhang Zhiyuan, Zhang Jie, Shen Zurong, Feng Guo, Xie Naishi, Zhang Junguang, Zuo Hua, and Chen Zhenquan, attended. The details of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Meeting Proceedings (1) Music played to commence the meeting; (2) All stood at attention; (3) The Party Song was sung; (4) The most respectful salute was paid to the national flag of the Party and the portrait of the late Premier; (5) The Chairman respectfully read the late Premier's will; (6) A moment of silence was observed to mourn the compatriots in the Northeast who had suffered hardship; (7) The presidium was elected. In addition to Zhang Junguang, Zuo Hua, and Chen Zhenquan, as decided by the preparatory committee, with Tu Liang as the Secretary-General of the conference, the other four members were elected by the conference: Zhang Zhihuan, Shen Zurong, Feng Dong, and Zhang Jie; (8) The Chairman of the presidium delivered an opening address; (9) A report on the preparatory process was presented; (10) Proposals were discussed. Eleven people were elected by the conference to form a proposal review committee to first organize and review the proposals before submitting them to the conference for discussion. The afternoon was devoted to the proposal review committee.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Speech Zhang Junguang, the Chairman of the presidium, delivered the opening address, saying: "Fellow representatives, under the invasion and oppression of Japanese imperialism, resisting Japan and saving the nation is the duty of our people. The reason for the establishment of this conference, and the only task after its establishment, is to earnestly save the nation and resist Japan. However, the mission of this conference is currently not limited to the single aspect of resisting Japan and saving the nation. There are still many important responsibilities for national salvation that we must address in conjunction. Therefore, the task of this conference is even heavier, and the members of this conference should also make redoubled efforts to shoulder this heavier task. In these days of deepening national crisis, when the nation is on the verge of collapse, and the aggression of Japanese imperialism in the three northeastern provinces is becoming more blatant and aggressive, our government still does not know to rise up and resist. The volunteer army is fighting bloody battles in the bitter cold outside the Great Wall, but there is no substantial assistance from within the Great Wall. The warlords of Sichuan and Shandong only know to engage in internal strife and infighting, and political factions are fighting and undermining each other all day long, while the national morale is declining and the organization is disintegrating. Under such a terrible situation, even the desire to resist Japan and save the nation is impossible. Based on this understanding and need, the members of this conference, in order to save the national crisis, will make every effort to promote this great union of national salvation organizations from all circles across the country. On the one hand, we will consolidate the strength of the people to serve as a backing for the government, and on the other hand, we will prepare to fight against Japanese imperialism with real strength. On the other hand, we will oppose the evil forces that harm the nation and promote domestic unity and peace. Only in this way can we save the overturning of the collapsing situation, relieve the people from their suffering, and secure the country on a solid foundation. This is the only proposition of this conference, and it is also the main reason for convening this national representative conference today. I hope that the representatives present will use our spirit and enthusiasm to work hard to save the nation. This is not only the good fortune of this conference, but also the good fortune of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>▲Report on the Preparatory Process Chen Zhenquan, recommended by the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory process, saying: "Fellow representatives, the purpose and task of this conference have just been explained in detail by Mr. Zhang Junguang, so I don't need to repeat them. Now, I will simply report to you the process of the preparation of this conference. The task of this conference is to focus on practical resistance to Japan and national salvation, and to unite the people of the whole country. Therefore, during the preparatory period, this conference has been working hard on the organization and union of various places throughout the country. During the three-month preparatory period, representatives were sent to various places to solicit comrades. For more distant places, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, and the Northeast provinces, we contacted them by post and telegraph, and asked them to immediately send representatives to reside in Shanghai so that we could meet face to face and work together. The national salvation organizations and patriotic people in various places, upon seeing the propositions of this conference, were of course very enthusiastic to participate. Therefore, in just over a month and a half, the first step of our membership solicitation procedure has been completed. The representatives who went to various places have returned to Shanghai one after another, and groups from distant provinces have also sent representatives to Shanghai. In total, in the past three months, more than 50 organizations and more than 100 people have come to participate in the organization. The foundation of the organization of this conference has been consolidated. This is the first stage of the preparation of this conference. After the organization of this conference had a foundation, we began the second stage of work. The work of this period was not completed until now, which is the organization, arrangement, and planning of various organizations, the drafting and discussion of the program and constitution, and finally the preparation for this conference. Although the work during this time was very trivial, it was also very important. It was only in a very short period of less than a month that we completed the task of preparing for the present, and the undertaking is now concluded. However, all the important tasks of this conference still require all members to work together to complete."</p>
<p>▲Proposal Review At 2:00 PM, the proposal review committee was convened. The attendees were Zhang Guangjun, Zuo Hua, Chen Zhenquan, Zhang Zhiyuan, Shen Zurong, Feng Guo, Zhang Jie, Huang Nanxi, Xie Naishi, Long Xiangsan, Dong Mosheng, Tan Jingyu, and Tu Liang, totaling 13 people. Zhang Junguang, Long Xiangsan, and Xie Naishi were elected as the military proposal review group. Chen Zhenquan, Tan Jingpin, Tu Liang Zuo, and Hua were elected as the political proposal review group. Zhang Zhiyuan, Zhang Jie, and Shen Zuru were elected as the diplomatic proposal review group.

<h3 id="e124">Monument Installation Ceremony for the Martyred Colleagues of the Two Railways <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲Scheduled to be Held on November 3rd</p>
<p>During the January 28th Anti-Japanese War, the Songhu Railway and the eastern section of the Jinghu Railway were strategically important. When the soldiers of the 19th Route Army bravely fought against the enemy, the employees of the two railways were dedicated to their duties in transporting and supplying military food, often disregarding the dangers in the midst of gunfire and continuing their work as usual. As a result, 14 people were martyred. Their loyalty, bravery, and sincerity are comparable to those of the fallen soldiers. After the war subsided, the employees of the two railways donated funds to create a bronze monument to the martyred employees, which was decided to be placed at various stations to commemorate them and to alert the people of the country. It has been decided that the monument installation ceremony will be held simultaneously at various stations at 10:00 AM on the morning of the third day of next month.</p>
<p>▲Monuments Placed at Various Stations A total of two large and six small monuments will be erected. One large monument will be erected opposite the station inspection office at the Shanghai North Station and one at the Nanjing Station. The six small monuments will be erected at the stations where the martyrs died. The director of the bureau, Director Chen, the chief of the Transportation Department, Zheng Zizhao, and the chiefs of the various sections will preside over the monument installation ceremonies at the various stations. The names, locations, and dates of the martyrdom of the martyred employees are as follows, according to an investigation by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency: Station Master Ji Youqing, colleagues Ye Keqing and Zhang Jinyin, martyred on February 7 at the Yuncaobang Station on the Songhu Railway; Trackman Zhang Wenkui, martyred on February 8 at the Zhanghuabang Station on the Songhu Railway; Trackman Gao Shaoquan, Station Clerk Zhang Rongsheng, and Gatekeeper Fan Hongsheng, martyred on January 29 at the Tiantong'an Station on the Songhu Railway; Gatekeeper Tian Rongfu, Zhang Hua, martyred on January 29 at the Baoshan Road Station on the Songhu Railway; Station Master Xu Bin on February 21, Flagman Xue Sanlang on February 11, and Clerk Wang Jingxian on February 24, successively martyred at the Nanxiang Station on the Jinghu Railway; Station Clerk Xuan Quandan, martyred on February 25 at the Zhenru Station on the Jinghu Railway; Trackman Zhu Yonglin, martyred on February 29 at the Xinlonghua Station on the Huhang Railway.</p>

<p>Since the departure of the first relief workers of the Northeast Volunteer Army, it has aroused the sympathy of young people from all over the country. Therefore, in recent days, many people have come to Shanghai to report their joining to the team. The second batch of team members is now actively preparing to depart. The internal organization has been greatly reformed. According to Fei Jianyun, the captain of the team, the first batch is expected to reach the battlefield in ten days. The team members who are departing this time all have the determination to die, and all have medical and military knowledge. Although the future results cannot be predicted at this time, the lives of these more than 50 people are all tied to the rear. If there is no continuous supply from the rear, the team members will inevitably be interrupted. Therefore, the team has been actively carrying out rear work in recent days to achieve the purpose of rescuing the volunteer army and to live up to the trust of the team members. We sincerely hope that all circles will continue to provide material assistance so that the team can easily depart in batches and devote itself to relief work. It would be a great blessing.</p>

<p>▲Hand Grenade Hit the Door Panel</p>
<p>▲Smoke Filled the Air and Passersby Fled</p>
<p>The Japanese Xinzeng Foreign Goods Store at 114-116 Fa Da Ma Road was bombed once on September 19 this year. No one was injured, only a few floorboards and glass were damaged. Unexpectedly, less than two months later, it was bombed for the second time yesterday. On the 27th of this month, the store received a warning letter. At about 6:15 PM yesterday, just as the store door was being closed, an uninvited guest kept knocking on the door. For the sake of prudence, the shop assistants did not answer. The person then left. About a quarter of an hour later, the sound of knocking on the door was heard again. The shop assistants peered out through the crack and saw that it was a familiar customer. They opened the door to let him in. Unexpectedly, just as the customer stepped into the doorway, a hand grenade came from across the road and hit the fifth and sixth door panels in the center. With a loud bang, the surrounding area shook. A corner of the door panel was destroyed, and smoke filled the air. Passersby fled, and the order was disrupted. The Dada Mingzhong Police Station was nearby and immediately sent detectives to investigate. They collected the damaged grenade shell and took it to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Jiangsu Rice Industry Association Executive and Supervisory Standing Committee Meeting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲Discussing the Problem of Low Rice Prices and Relief Measures</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association held its 12th meeting of the second session of the Executive and Supervisory Standing Committee at Qinxuitang at 3:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Li Zhongchen, Chen Junyu, Zhu Yinzheng, Cai Yukun, Gong Zhaoming, Zhang Jing, Lu Gongquan (represented by Yao Kejun), Zhao Zixin (represented by Xi Fanwo), Zhang Nianxuan (represented by Xi Zhaoshi), Jiang Zisheng, and Fu Qiangeng (represented by Liu Renjie) attended, totaling 13 people. Zhu Zixiang was elected as the chairman, and the ceremony was performed as usual. The chairman reported that the chairman of the association, Ye Huijun, was vacant due to illness and should be elected as soon as possible to take over the affairs of the association. A standing committee member should also be elected from among the executive committee members to reach the legal number of people. The application of which method to promote and elect should be decided by the public. It was resolved that this would be decided at the next general meeting of members. (2) Rice prices are falling daily, and the authorities also have proposals for domestic circulation to provide relief. However, empty words cannot help the actual situation. The government should be asked to implement the abolition of the ban. It was resolved to telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Government to lift the ban as soon as possible to provide relief. (3) The rice industry associations of Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi counties proposed that rice prices have fallen miserably, and farmers and merchants are in distress. They should request the transfer of telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Department of Finance to temporarily waive the rice, rice, and grain business tax during this period of excessively low rice prices to provide relief. It was resolved that it would be forwarded immediately. (4) Lu Gongquan proposed that the Executive Yuan convene a national food conference to discuss relief measures. This association, as a legal entity of the rice industry in the province, should send representatives to attend and participate. It was resolved that the food conference had already closed and should not be discussed. (5) Lu Gongquan proposed that foreign rice and wheat are dumped in the country, causing agricultural products to fall in price. It is reported that the government has ordered a large number of foreign wheat imports. The government should immediately stop this to maintain the national foundation and save the farmers in distress. It was resolved that the government should be telegraphed for appeal. The chairman then stated that the Hu Mi dispute occurred in Shanghai this time, and the mainland industry was also misunderstood. This special incidental report was made to clarify the truth. Since Shanghai has had Hu Zi, there has never been a so-called heavy Hu and light Hu. Each industry is a commercial nature, and there is no gain or loss for the weight, so there is no prejudice between them. Zi Ji has been handled fairly by the Social Bureau, so how will it be regulated in the future, so the industry is happy to follow it.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Muslims Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲Representatives Go to Beijing This Morning to Petition</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Mosque believes that the content of the book "Little Pig Bajie" published by Beixin Bookstore is particularly insulting to Muslims, causing disputes. Muslims hosted the press at the Qinglian Street Mosque on Fangbang Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to make a statement to seek sympathy. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Imams of the Ten Mosques of Shanghai who attended the meeting yesterday included Ji Dapusheng, Ma Jingwu, Zhou Guangqing, Wang Dusheng, Ma Rusong, Ha Decheng, Zhang Shanqing, Wen Zowu, Hong Chenjin, and Zhang Chaozhen, as well as more than 50 Muslims.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Report Jin Xusheng, the chairman of the association, reported the situation of being insulted: (1) The Ten Mosques of Shanghai organized a temporary meeting to discuss the matter jointly. Committee members of 29 people are all with knowledge and are researching the case, and advise the faithful to be calm and presented the central and Shanghai municipal government. The Ministry of the Interior has replied and approved the verification and handling, and instructed to wait quietly for the solution. (2) The important key to this case is that the bookstore has offended all the faithful. The impact is unimaginable, so it cannot be regarded as an ordinary insult to deal with the matter. The central authorities must treat the bureau with the appropriate crime to calm the public anger of the Muslims of the country. If it is treated with ordinary laws, it will arouse public anger, and it is difficult to guarantee that it will not cause a major incident in the northwest. This is not an excessive statement, because a spark can start a prairie fire, and we must be prepared for the long term. (3) The newspapers in Shanghai attach great importance to this case and are grateful for the fair criticism and assistance to Muslims. Therefore, I invite you to come here today to express my gratitude. If your newspaper can comment again, to eliminate the public outrage and to calm the public, it is even more meritorious. (4) The Beixin Bookstore's "Little Pig Bajie" insulted the various aspects of Islam, and the outside is not clear about the truth. It is thought that this book is just a novel, and there is no need to care about it. The Imams of the mosques are now pointing out the main points of the book's insults to Islam and making a declaration. Imam Da will make a statement to your reporter and explain it, and I hope that you will enlighten me, etc. Then, Imam Da read the declaration (the declaration is recorded later) and dispersed at 5:00.</p>
<p>▲Go to Beijing to Petition The mosque has also specially sent Wu Yongxia, Da Pusheng, Ma Xingdong, and Mu Huating on the 9:00 early express train to Beijing to petition the central party, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of the Interior, requesting: (1) Punishing the Beixin Bookstore; (2) Ordering bookstores across the country not to repeat the same thing in the future.</p>
<p>▲Imams' Declaration The declaration of the Imams of the Mosques of Shanghai: The case of the publication of insults to Islam by the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore is a great misfortune for Muslims, and it is also a deep pain for the Imams. Since Islam entered the Eastern Land, there used to be a gap between the faithful and the non-faithful. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the five ethnic groups merged into one family, and the Muslims were sincere in their love for the country. To this day, the relationship between the Han and the Muslims has no prejudice. This is the doctrine of Great Harmony, which has already been mentioned in the Koran. The Imams encourage themselves with this, and teach people with this. The unity of the five ethnic groups lies in good feelings. In this weak China, it is necessary to consolidate the groups and resist foreign insults, and there should be no cracks, so that foreigners can take advantage of them. Unexpectedly, the Beixin Bookstore has published a book that insults the church for no reason. The political content has been described in detail in the letter to the Central Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government and published in the Shanghai newspapers on October 28. You should wait quietly for the Central Government to find out the facts and handle them. The following is a summary of the various kinds of insults to Islam in this book, which I think will be strange to the gentlemen of the world. (1) The book begins with, "Pig Bajie gave birth to a Little Pig Bajie, ... Huihui (Muslims)."(2) The book says, "When the Huihui kill cows, there are two lines of scriptures, not good, not good, really not good, you shouldn't kill my grandma." According to Islam, there is no ancient etiquette of not killing for no reason. Therefore, when slaughtering cattle and sheep, you must recite the scriptures. In this book, the bureau changed two very obscene words, which not only insulted Islam, but also blasphemed the classics, which is really painful. (3) The book says, "Little Pig Bajie's pig father Bajie is the ancestor of the Huihui, and Little Pig Bajie's mother is the ancestress of the Huihui." These words can be said to insult Muslims to the extreme. Who doesn't have ancestors? If you scold the ancestors of passers-by, there is no one who doesn't respond with harsh words, not to mention that the scolded is the whole crowd, and the words are so extreme. As children and grandchildren, how can they bear it? (4) The cover "depicts the ugly face of Pig Bajie, and draws the soup bottle used by Muslims on the cover." The soup bottle is a container for Muslims to cleanse themselves, and it has the same meaning as the Tang Pan Daily News. Muslims must cleanse themselves and worship the Lord five times, that is, the Book of Songs Zhao Shi God, Mencius's so-called fasting and bathing to serve God, but the etiquette is different from Islam. Tang Ping is valued by Muslims, and it is taken for its cleanliness. Now this book treats it as Pig Bajie's turbidity, which is even more resentful by the worshipers. The above is only a summary, and the insults and obscenity of the whole book are unbearable to repeat. Now try to ask the following questions. (1) The Beixin Bookstore insults Muslims with various abusive words, so that Muslims also insult the Beixin Bookstore with these words. Can the Beixin Bookstore bear it? The Beixin Bookstore and its branches in various ports have no less than a thousand people, so that they also scold their entire body with this kind of abusive language, can they bear it? Or can't bear it? Do not do to others what you do not want to do to yourself. If you think about it from the perspective of others, you should also know that it is impossible. What's more, there are 50 million Muslims, of course they can't bear it. (2) This book is scolded as Islam. If the word "Huihui" in this book is changed to "non-Huihui", can everyone in "non-Huihui" bear it? It is difficult to commit public anger, and there are ancient precepts. It cannot be accepted on the one hand in "non-Huihui", and it is also a crowd of 50 million people in the "Huihui" party, of course they cannot bear it. The text is used to carry the Tao, and writing books and theories is to promote national learning. National learning is to correct people's hearts and dispel heresies. The bookstore issues books, which is the key to promoting national learning. China is suffering from the loss of national learning today. The Doctrine of the Mean says that what God commands is called nature, following nature is called Tao, and cultivating Tao is called teaching. The Great Learning says that it lies in Mingmingde, in Xinmin, and in stopping at the highest good. The essence of Islam is here. The world is the same day. The Chinese scholars of the past all said that the character of God is the master. Cheng Zhu Lu Wang, although the parties are different, there are many who say that God in the book is the master. The Islamic Church has a society. Since the occurrence of this case in Beixin Bookstore, it has especially wished to correct people's hearts and dispel heresies. The scholars of the church will study Islam as a research, and especially wish to discuss it with the scholars of Confucianism. The distribution of this kind of heresy by the Beixin Bookstore is the most harmful in the industry. The books that insult Islam, the Muslims of the mosques, are certainly hated, and the virtuous people in the book industry must also blame them, that is, all non-book industry people must also blame them, and in the Beixin Bookstore, ask their conscience, know that they must also blame themselves, the Chinese scholars of the past said, so it is called a person, that is, in this conscience, the Beixin Bookstore does not want to be a person, then it is already, if you want to be a person, for this kind of insult to the whole Islam heresy, you should also base it on conscience, self-trial, the purpose of my teaching is all in conscience, Wang Yangming said, conscience is conscience, including benevolence, justice and morality, and the new bookstore is so unkind, unjust and immoral to this point, if you teach it with the teachings of Islam, they will not be taught, if you teach it with Confucian books, they will not be taught, that is, people who cannot be taught, no wonder heresies are rampant, now this case is waiting for the central authorities to find out the facts and handle them according to law, but the most important thing to declare is that this book's appendix says, "This story meets the conditions of rumors, compiled in the collection, in order to distribute it," to scold people, and make excuses for the story, and think that it meets the conditions of rumors, and then write it in large letters, compile it in the collection, in order to distribute it, that is, its intention to incite the anger of Muslims, and to make them start a fight, in order to alienate the spirit of the nation, the conspiracy of the intention, even more does not need to bother to explain, Alas, the books of Islam have not been widely distributed, so that this case has happened today, that is also the Imams' failure to preach, there are Han translated Islamic books, called Tianfang Xingli, Tianfang Code, during the Kang Qian period, Jinling Liu Jielian's concubine translated and presented them, in addition, there are many kinds of books on science translation, the learning of the world, the world shares it, Qiu Ziyun, there is no class to teach, and the teachings of heaven are the oldest teachings, and it is also the world's can not be ignored, I hereby declare, I would like to see you, Shanghai Islamic mosques, etc. together to start,</p>

<p>The Shanghai Pushan Villa Lianyi Benevolent Association specially issued a notice yesterday for soliciting goods for the sale of coupons for the award of relief to the disaster victims in Northeast China. The disaster victims in Northeast China have been repeatedly subjected to the miserable disasters of war and floods. Without clothes or food, they are extremely distressed. The charity organizations in this port have set up a relief federation. The Shan Zhuang (this benevolent association) stepped in between them, exhausting its cotton for raising funds. However, because the disaster area is vast and it is difficult to raise funds, they are anxious. There is a person named Yan An, who is a business tycoon in the sea, cares about charity, is at the age of ancient rare, and is even more sincere in his deeds. He is willing to donate more than 300 pieces of various ancient porcelain, bronzes, and toys that he has collected for more than 40 years to help revitalize the Northeast. He entrusted the Shan Zhuang and this benevolent association to publish in the newspaper to change the price. Such generosity and philanthropy are truly rare and valuable. If you are enthusiastic about supporting, hearing the wind and starting up, as well as the great benevolent Mr. Yan An, please move your jade to the office of the Lianyi Benevolent Association at 151 Shanxi Road, Public Concession, so that you can choose a place and set a time to compile and display the lottery tickets and raise funds for transfer. The top-ranking merits are respectfully done to ask for them.</p>

<p>Butcher Gangs Stage Bloody Feud</p>
<p>▲ Jiangbei Gang Members Assault People from Beiping</p>
<p>The Shandong Gang and the Jiangbei Gang, both groups of butchers, have harbored deep-seated grudges due to disputes over the purchase of pigs. Recently, conflicts between members of the two gangs have frequently occurred, resulting in mutual killings. Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, two butchers from Beiping, Chen Cuiqing and Hua Zhenhai, who worked at a butchery located at No. 12 Tianhou Lane, Yuezhou Road, in the Public Concession, took a tram from the northern part of the city to the south. They got off at the Oil Depot Wharf, intending to go to a pig market there to select pigs. Unexpectedly, just as they got off the tram and had taken only a few steps, more than 30 members of the Jiangbei Gang, led by Wang Guirong, swarmed up and indiscriminately attacked the two men with axes and iron rulers. In an instant, both men were covered in wounds and bleeding profusely, collapsing into a pool of blood in extreme pain. Chao Yueshun and others from the 18th patrol post in the area heard of the incident and rushed to the scene. By then, the Jiangbei Gang members had scattered and fled, with only Wang Guirong being apprehended. Wang was taken to the first precinct's first station for interrogation, while the two injured men were taken to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries of both men are severe, and their lives may be in danger.</p>

<p>Banditry in Tangwan Township</p>
<p>Several bandits descended upon Zhoujiazhai in the Erqu area of Tangwan Township in the western suburbs the other night. When they were robbing the homes of villagers in Gaojiali, Lin Bin, the deputy head of the township's defense corps, and Yang Hui, an officer from the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, were leading the corps and police on patrol. They heard the commotion in the village and rushed to the scene. The bandits had already plundered the wealth of Zhou Ahai, Wang Xingen, and others, and were escaping with their loot, traveling along the Pu River by boat. The corps and police were unable to pursue them due to a lack of boats. They then searched for the remaining bandits in the surrounding villages. They arrived at Peicai Township at dawn. According to villagers such as Zhang Guisheng, a suspicious boat was docked at the Daliu Port. The corps and police investigated and found a boat, but no one was on board. It was abandoned by the Roman bandit gang. After searching the boat, they found the boat's registration papers and other items. The boat was impounded and guarded, and the authorities began investigating the whereabouts of the bandits to apprehend and punish them.</p>

<p>Water Damage to Water Chestnut Boat After Striking Stone Bridge</p>
<p>Water chestnuts from the Xinshi area of Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, have long enjoyed a strong reputation. Every early winter, merchants would send their employees with funds to purchase water chestnuts from the locals and load them onto boats, which would then be towed by small steamers to Shanghai for sale. This practice has become commonplace. The other day, a small steamer (i.e., a gasoline boat) was towing two boats loaded with water chestnuts from Xinshi to Shanghai when it sped up to try to get to Shanghai first and cash in on the market. However, as it sped near the Shaxi Long Bridge, about five li from Xinshi, the second boat struck the bridge stones due to excessive power. The bow of the boat was smashed, and water immediately flooded in, causing it to sink. The sailors on board fell into the river. Fortunately, the water chestnut boats were mostly without cargo holds, and the sailors were good swimmers. The steamer stopped and rescued the sailors, preventing any fatalities. However, the water chestnuts on board, worth more than 300 yuan, were all dumped into the river. Yesterday, the steamer arrived in Shanghai and reported the incident to the cargo owners for handling.</p>

<p>Chen Zixiang, a 30-year-old native of Zhejiang, had been staying in Room 27 of the Dahua Hotel at No. 85 Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession for 45 days. Recently, he introduced a fellow villager to work as a waiter at the Nanjing Hotel. The prospective waiter had entrusted Chen with 450 yuan to pass on, but Chen secretly used the money himself. Now, the prospective waiter had come to Shanghai to inquire whether the job had been secured, which caused Chen to feel ashamed and desperate, leading him to take his own life by poisoning himself at the hotel the other night. It was not until 1:00 PM yesterday that the waiter noticed Chen was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital, but due to the severity of the poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3:30 PM. The hospital reported the incident to the police station, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall mortuary for an autopsy. As there were no relatives of the deceased, the police will report the case to the court for inspection.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Attempt Thwarted</p>

<p>▲ Soldiers Liu Kun and Others Follow</p>
<p>Wang Zhaodi, a 14-year-old native of Changzhou and sister of Wang Genda, who resides at No. 151 Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, works in a silk factory.

A kidnapper named Chen Youcai took the opportunity to entice her with sweet words and began to lead her away. They were overheard whispering along the way by soldiers Liu Kun and Chen Afu, who suspected their actions. They followed Chen and eavesdropped on their conversation, confirming that it was a kidnapping. They immediately alerted the police and brought Chen and the girl to the Fifth District Police Station. After questioning, it was determined that Chen had taken the opportunity to kidnap her. Liu Genda was summoned to the station, and Chen was sent to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Special Article Judge Tang's Research Report on the Situation of the Shanghai Public Concession Volume 4 (8)</p>
<p>Deliberation on Governance and Reporting</p>
<p>What needs to be directly understood is that the organization of a city must be regarded as a whole organic entity, and all distinctions between them are only superficial. This kind of organic entity has several molecules, but each of these molecules is actually a part of a whole entity. Every action related to governance contains two elements, namely, will, or original power, and the method of execution or implementation. In theory, the determination of action is different from the execution of action, but in practice, from the establishment of a resolution to the implementation of the resolution, it is a whole action. Looking at the nature of the British municipal organization, it can be seen that the origin of the resolution lies in the citizen representatives of the city council or committee. The real basis and element of the city government is the original power of the representative body, rather than the purely mechanical work of executing the will of the representative body. The will belongs to the city council that has been entrusted with power, and the will owned by the agent of the city council is only secondary. The actual governance work is usually determined by the resolution of the committee, which is undoubtedly true, but the city council can still freely intervene at any time and refuse to approve it, thus invalidating the resolution of the secondary group and replacing the wrongly expressed will of its lower-level agent with its own higher will."</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the City Council and the Committee</p>
<p>"One level that must always be remembered is that each committee is a molecule of an entity, a hand and foot of the city council, not a separate agency, but a member of a larger agency. Not only is the committee a limb of the city council, but also according to the municipal government organization law, each member of the committee is also a part of the city council. Not only is the committee a smaller-scale city council with its own special functions, but the city council still retains its full original power after the committee is established. Suppose this kind of power is more rarely exercised in the city council, it is because of the recognition that the committee and its staff have a special opportunity to constitute a proper decision in its administrative part in charge. In general, the city council can always expand and contract the scope of authority of the committee at will, and can control the operation of the committee with ordinary rules and special resolutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, the various committees and their staff are by no means merely the instruments of the city council. The decision of the city council is the final ruling, but it is wrong to regard the city council as a worker, and its various committees or its staff as the instruments used by the worker to work. Except for the questions of policy organization that need to be decided, the committee can proceed according to its own design and is rarely interfered by the superior agency. This is probably true, and it is probably true for the committees in large cities. In theory, it would be easy for a councilor to make difficulties for the committee and disrupt its plans when the city council meets every month, but in practice, the difficulties in theory have not occurred, because every city councilor is a committee member and knows that he should trust other committees other than his own, and must trust them. A sense of responsibility arises from trust, and trust and responsibility are the six key points for appropriate measures.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the Committee and the Staff</p>
<p>The relationship between the committee and its staff reflects the relationship between the city council and the committee. The people of the mainland often have the concept of regarding officials as high-ranking figures, but the British do not have this tendency or need. Except in the courts, Congress, and in etiquette and social aspects for the British King, the British have not seen a high position in their minds. Those who are appointed and paid by the representatives of cities or rural areas to implement and execute the law have no high status. On the other hand, the officials of the city government, although their position cannot make their treatment particularly different from what their fellow citizens enjoy, but if they can engage in work that is beneficial to the people anywhere in the UK, they can obtain a full sense of appreciation. Those with expert knowledge and skills can also get the respect they deserve. The respect received by the senior officials of the city government, as well as the trust of the committee, the city council, and even the general public in the various officials, is purely due to their character, ability, and the importance of their work, not due to the official position held by the various officials. It is rare for officials to be the subject of mutual attacks between political factions. Although there is a relationship between political skills and the appointment of officials, or a relationship with resignation, although the latter is very rare, the motives for such appointments and removals are not announced. The characteristic of the British civil service system is unwavering loyalty to the frequently transferred political officers. The merits of the facilities of various parts of the government are attributed to the political officers of the reading parts, and if there is a mistake, it is also the responsibility of the officer in charge. If his subordinates are attacked, the political officer in charge will come forward to defend them. The power exercised by the permanent staff over their administrative officers is often very great. This administrative officer, in terms of the city government,</p>

<h3 id="e140">Yun Huifang's Appeal Case Scheduled for Trial <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ Letter of appeal has been submitted to the court.</p>
<p>▲ Trial set for December 21st</p>
<p>Yun Huifang, a member of the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors" group, angered by traitorous merchants privately selling Japanese goods and undermining the boycott movement, sent letters and bombs to the Cotton Cloth Association and the Yongchang Coal Store and Maochang Foreign Goods Store on Xin Zha Road, warning them. She was arrested by Chinese police officers in the Chinese concession and taken to the French Concession Police Department, who handed her over to the Second Special District Local Court. The court sentenced her to one month in prison but, considering that she was under sixteen years old, granted probation. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police Department transferred her to the First Special District Local Court, which sentenced her to one year in prison and allowed her to be released on bail. All of this has been previously reported. Yun, at the time of the sentencing, stated that she did not accept the verdict. Soon after, her representative lawyer filed an appeal. The First Special Court submitted the case file to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for handling. It is recently learned that Yun's lawyer has submitted the letter of appeal to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the court, considering the importance of the case and the need to expedite its handling, has scheduled a special trial for 1 PM on December 21st in the first courtroom. Subpoenas for the witnesses to appear in court have also been issued and ordered to be delivered by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Fire Indemnity Association in Disaster Area Urges Prompt Adoption of Public Bond Measures <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fire Insurance Indemnity Promotion Association for the disaster area, after the Chinese insurance companies approved the public bond measures, convened a full executive committee meeting at the Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce on Edward Road at 1 PM yesterday. More than twenty people attended, including Fang Jiaobo, Wang Xianhua, Chen Songyuan, Tang Youwei, Gu Zhuxuan, Mo Meiqing, and Ye Xiaoshan. Fang Jiaobo chaired the meeting, and the meeting was conducted according to procedures. First, Tang Youwei reported on the recent developments in the association's affairs and the proposed implementation plans. Then, various cases were discussed. (1) A letter was sent to the Chinese managers of the foreign insurance companies, requesting them to explain the advantages and disadvantages to the foreign directors in detail. (2) It was decided that committee members Tang Youwei and Mo Meiqing would attend the meetings of the Claims Settlement Committee as non-voting members. (3) A document was submitted to the Social Bureau urging the prompt adoption of a public bond scheme. The document stated, "Submitting this document for requesting matters, we have respectfully received your bureau's instruction No. 4963. Upon reading it, we found that only the Chinese companies have approved the issuance of public bonds to resolve the fire insurance indemnity in the disaster area, while the foreign companies have not yet expressed their opinions, which is regrettable. We urge your bureau to take strict measures to negotiate so that the Chinese and foreign companies can reach a consensus. Otherwise, the tens of thousands of victims in the affected area will pledge to provide backing and continue the struggle. We await further instructions on how to proceed. As for the details of the public bond scheme, such as the method and regulations, we respectfully request your bureau to promptly formulate a detailed plan (or instruct the representatives of the accounting firm who originally proposed the scheme to draft it) and announce it so that the outside world can understand it and facilitate smooth progress. We also request that the insurance companies be thoroughly reorganized and that regulations and restrictions be implemented as soon as possible so that they can complement the public bond scheme and benefit all. This document is respectfully submitted by Yu Qiaqing, Fang Shubo, Chen Songyuan, Wang Xianhua, Mo Meiqing, Tang Youwei, Wang Binyan, and others to Wu, the Director of the Shanghai Social Bureau."</p>

<h3 id="e143">Wang Xunfu Involved in Kidnapping Case with Widow <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲ Defendant allegedly negotiated ransom and inquired about the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Shot in the waist while escaping, then captured.</p>
<p>Wang Xunfu, a native of Yangzhou residing in a bungalow on Yucai Road in the Chinese concession, is implicated in a case involving a group of armed individuals who kidnapped Wang Yu, a widow from Shaoxing, from her residence at No. 71, Tai'an Lane, Beishan West Road, around 11 PM on January 10th of this year. They also robbed her of valuables worth $270. He was detained by Detective Shen Chongli of the Hongkou Police Department and brought before the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Judge Shen Bingrong of the Third Criminal Court conducted an inquiry the other day. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the Police Department stated that during the reinvestigation, it was discovered that prior to the incident, Jiang Dinghui, who has already been arrested and executed, invited him to the Qixin Inn on Fuzhou Road to conspire with Xiao Wang, Li Xiuyu (who has already died), and others to rob Wang Yu's property. After kidnapping her, they hid her in a house at No. 560, Dixiwei Road, and sent letters to her relatives demanding a ransom of $100,000. Around 10 PM on the 19th of the month, he and Jiang Dinghui, Wang Xianqiao, and others went to the vicinity of the intersection of Edward Road and Jiangxi North Road to negotiate the ransom with the widow's representatives. They resisted the police officers with gunfire. Xiao Wang and Li Xiuyu were killed on the spot. The defendant was shot in the waist and escaped, but was finally captured on the 26th at the Xieqiao Hospital in the French Concession after being treated by Dr. Guo Renji. The medical expenses totaled $38.50. He left the hospital on February 12th. The police previously found a gray robe with bullet holes at his home, which the defendant was wearing when he was negotiating on Edward Road, as well as evidence of the group's resistance to arrest at the time. Zhang Yunsheng, a Chinese detective from No. 320, Dixiwei Road Police Department, Shang Wu, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Police Department, and the victim, Wang Yu, were all summoned to court for questioning. The gray silk robe was presented for examination, and the bullet holes were clearly visible. According to Wang Yu's statement, prior to the incident, on January 1st, a woman claiming to be surnamed Lin and Li Xiuyu (who has already died) came to rent a room behind the living room. After a few days, Xiao Wang also came. On the evening in question, she, along with her relative Wang Jiliang and a woman surnamed Luo who lived with her, were playing mahjong upstairs when Lin and Li Xiuyu came upstairs under the pretext of borrowing a pen. They immediately produced guns and threatened them. Lin dragged her downstairs and pushed her into her bedroom, where she was monitored by the defendant and another unknown person armed with guns. After a while, Lin told her that her sister-in-law was going out. She was then taken by a group of people to a car waiting at the San Tai Wharf and driven to a location where she temporarily resided in the back room of a house. She was guarded by Lin, Li Xiuyu, and a thin man for about ten days, after which Lin ordered the two men to leave quickly, and she was able to escape. She did not know how much ransom was demanded, as it was all negotiated with her relatives, Wang Jiliang, and others. She has now returned to her hometown of Shaoxing. Detective Zhang Yunsheng stated that around 8 PM on the 19th, he and the detectives went to the Mengyuan Hotel on Hankou Road and obtained the bandit's phone number. He and the plaintiff's representative, surnamed Wang, went to the vicinity of the intersection of Edward Road and Jiangxi North Road. He disguised himself as a rickshaw puller and saw the defendant standing in the middle of Edward Road, wearing the gray silk robe presented as evidence and a Luo Song hat, talking to two men in suits, with his hands in his pockets, as if he was reaching for a gun. He had already heard gunshots. He stepped forward to arrest him, but he fled into the nearby Dechang Lane. There were wooden boxes piled up in the alley, and he feared that he would be ambushed. He was then able to escape. Detective Shang Wu stated that he saw the defendant in the middle of the road in front of the Anlegong Dance Hall on that road. He tried to restrain him, and gunshots rang out on both sides, knocking down two bandits. Dr. Guo Renji stated that the defendant came to the hospital for treatment on January 26th, using the alias Ma Gengsheng. He examined his wound and found that the bullet had already exited from his waist. There was no major problem. He stayed for sixteen days and was discharged after a full recovery. The medical expenses totaled $38.50. When questioned, the defendant stated that he had never been to Wang Yu's home. Jiang Dinghui invited him to the small hotel beforehand, saying that after this matter was completed, he would be given money to start a business. He went to Edward Road to be on the lookout and fled when he heard gunshots. He provided other evasive answers. Judge Shen ordered that he be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Sun Xiewen, the magistrate of Baoshan County, inspected the organizational status of the defense corps in various districts and surveyed the autumn harvest situation. He successively visited the cities and towns of Yangxing, Yuepu, Shengqiao, Luodian, and Dachang, and summoned the heads of various villages and towns to gather at the respective district offices for instructions.

<p>[New Times for Shanghai-Songjiang Long-Distance Buses</p>
<p>▲ Effective from November 1st</p>
<p>Since the trial operation of the Shanghai-Songjiang Long-Distance Bus Company, the number of passengers has been increasing daily. However, the Huijiao Bridge at the Shanghai-Songjiang border has not yet been completed, preventing the official operation of the buses. The section from the Beiqiao Station to the Huijiao Bridge is being operated by borrowing vehicles from the Shanghai-Minhang Company. The company has set the new bus schedule to be effective from November 1st. The schedule is listed below: From Songjiang: 8:15 AM, 10:15 AM, 1:15 PM, 3:15 PM. From Shanghai: 8:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 1:30 PM, 3:30 PM. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Songjiang should board the bus at the Shanghai Station of the Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Company on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Privately Owned Cars Traveling on Shanghai-Minhang Road <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fees will still be collected as usual.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company, which is managed by merchants, had allowed privately owned cars to pass through the Caohejing and Zhamen gates on the road for free since Double Ten Day due to the opening of the Jiang-Zhe Highway. However, the company is now concerned that the increasing number of vehicles is damaging the road surface, reducing its revenue, and increasing its expenditure on road maintenance. It feels that it cannot continue to make such sacrifices. Logically, car owners who benefit from using the road should fulfill their obligation to pay fees. This sentiment is shared by many Chinese and foreign residents. Therefore, starting from November 1st, privately owned cars traveling on the road for sightseeing or to the gardens on the Jiangbian side will still be charged fees as usual in order to maintain operations and compensate for losses.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction Minhang Ferry Management Office, located in Minhang Town, Shanghai, has been working day and night to ferry cars across the river, which is financially difficult and difficult to maintain. It has been decided that from November 1st, the ferry will operate as usual from 6 AM to 6 PM daily. After 6 PM, regardless of whether the cars are privately owned or commercially operated, the toll fee will be five yuan per vehicle. This announcement has already been posted at the ferry terminal.</p>

<p>The Ning-Shao Shipping Company held a temporary shareholders meeting yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association to revise the company's articles of association. Fang Jiaobo was elected as chairman. The chairman presented the proposed revisions, which were discussed and approved by the shareholders present. However, because the number of shares represented at the meeting did not meet the legal requirements, the resolution was considered a provisional resolution. Another temporary shareholders meeting will be held within fifteen days.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Candy Vendor Angrily Strikes Child, Severing an Ear <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Li, a 20-year-old woman from Gaoyou residing at No. 13, Youzhi Alley, Duojia Road, Nanshi District, usually makes a living by selling candy on the streets. Yesterday morning around 9 AM, she went out as usual to sell her candy. As she passed Qinglongge, a boy named Wen Qiyu (16 years old, from Tianjin), who lived nearby, came to her with a copper coin and wanted to play a dice game for candy. She rolled a five, and the boy rolled a six. According to the rules, the boy should have won, but she insisted that the boy only rolled a five, and the two began to argue. In a fit of anger, she raised her carrying pole and struck the boy on the head. The boy dodged, but was struck on the left ear, which was severed. Blood flowed profusely, and the boy cried out in pain. He Wenyi, the guard at the 31st post in the area, heard the commotion and rushed over. He first sent the boy to the hospital for treatment and then took the woman to the First District First Precinct. After a preliminary interrogation by the precinct chief, he transferred her to the Shanghai District Court for further investigation because the matter involved injury.</p>
