<h3 id="c1">史汀生之講壇外交　翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>溯一二八滬變起後。中日惡化。影響所及。震撼寰宇。日本對吾之蠻橫。旣已盡暴於天下。而世界各國。仍皆袖手旁觀。獨美國猶在此冷靜狀態中。時時宣布其文書式之外交。二月二十四日。美國務卿史汀生致波拉議員書。洋洋灑灑。遍誦世界借私人之函件。訴當局之衷曲。藉維護九國公約之呼聲作對日警告之表示。其用心亦云苦矣。其奈日本始終堅持其一貫之政策何。　四月初。史汀生嘗渡大西洋而赴歐。一般觀察。都以此行將爲遠東問題關一新出路。不再蹈以前文書外交之窠臼。詎料日本仍置之不理。其態度或且愈加强硬。史氏跋涉重洋。徒勞往返。亦惟有空喚奈何而已。　今也。熱河告急。華北瀕危。日本對吾。愈作咄咄逼人之勢。而史汀生忽於斯時。對紐約外交討論會演講（非戰公約之發展）。閘明非戰公約之原理。指斥日本之違法。辭正而嚴。滔滔不絕。其全文亦已公布於世界。一若史汀生之外交。已從文書式而變爲講壇式之一新途徑矣。　史氏對於非戰公約之理論。精闢透澈。凡於國際法有相當信仰者。必十分。</p>
<p>悅服。其指斥日本之言曰。</p>
<p>（一國之欲在保衛其國民之僞飾下而爲其帝國主義戴一假面具者其假面具不久即將揭破。）字裏行間確能洞燭日本之野心。戳破日本之虚僞。語傳東洋。句句刺耳。無怪日本官塲對史氏之演說。大爲驚疑也。日本外務省之發言人。對史氏演說有所表示。</p>
<p>（希望第三方面。勿作可使時局愈臻嚴重之言行。此種言論徒增日政府支配民情之困難。日本已决計在中俄之間。設一緩衝國。）而日本報紙亦一致對史氏演說表示憤懣。史氏之演說。似已挑起日本朝野之重大反感。日本是否將對美提出抗議。姑置不論。惟日本對吾侵略之專橫。已在此外務省發言人寥寥數語中表示。所謂决計在中俄間設一緩衝國。措詞何等堅决。對付美國之態度。又何等强硬。試問史汀生又將奈何之耶。是故史汀生之一番議論。其效力僅能博得講壇下聽衆之彩聲而已。史氏文書外交之失敗。猶歷歷在目。吾人不信其講壇外交。可以轉移東亞之和平也。嗟乎。太平洋上。風雲之變幻日急。吾大好神州。竟供他人俎上之　。史汀生之一言。雖足遠驚東洋。實不能稍殺日本之氣燄。而環顧我國内中樞不固。領袖離散。際斯國際間急如薪火之形勢。將何以禦侮。更何以救亡耶。</p>

<p>七十九　　朱先生與唐博士相見的時候，難免有些客套話，我只得從略，單記他們質疑問難之議論。唐先生首先把我的話來問朱先生：（貴村旣然提倡生産，似宜運用新機器，迎頭去學外國，纔能發生偉大的效力，先生爲何還要用手工藝來幹？）朱先生說：（迎頭學外國是要把整個過程澈底的學來纔是正軌。比如用西法印書須從造林製紙，冶鋼一直學到做印刷機和用大機器印刷。如果單學機器印刷，那末要造機器没有鋼，要造紙没有木料，結果辦一個印書館或是一個報館，就非買外國機器和外國紙不可。於是印書館與報館便成了外國紙的大規模的推銷機關，甚至於本身生命就操在外國紙商的手裏。迎頭學外國是要先學他造林，製紙，冶鋼，做機器，後學他的大機器印刷。造紙，冶鋼，做機器没有學好以前，一躍就要學他的大機器印刷，那是危險極了。所以依我看來，迎頭學外國是有順序的，這順序一經顚倒便要發生實業界的不安。敝村所提倡之生産事業中有一樣是從種棉花一直到裁縫。種棉花是採取最新的科學方法，至於紡紗，織布，裁縫還是用手工藝，不過在手工藝上也是要力謀技術之進，</p>
<p>步。）唐先生說：（手工藝織的布如何可以與機器出品競爭？）朱先生說：（汽車與轎子競爭，勝敗如何？）唐先生說：（當然汽車勝，轎子敗，上海從民國十八年起是一頂轎子也没有了。）朱先生說：（上海没有一頂轎却有許多手車。汽車能把轎子趕得精光却趕不動那獨輪的手車。這是什麽緣故？坐轎的人改坐了汽車所以汽車是適者生存而轎子則被天然淘汰了。坐手車的人依舊只坐得起手車而坐不起汽車，所以手車還是適者生存，汽車雖兇打不倒手車。機器只能打倒一部份手工藝，還有一部份是不容易打倒的。對不對？）</p>

<p>笑話奇談的矮子捧出一個傀儡式的滿洲國，社會上對於相傳滿字的俗語，都覺得非常神秘，便要窮思極想的打開這神秘之門。據他們的見地，有以下的幾種解釋；　　滿頭大汗。｜這句應在溥儀身上，他去做滿洲的傀儡元首便是滿頭。大汗便是大可汗，是說他未醒皇帝夢的意思，　　滿飯好吃，滿話難說。｜矮子强指關外民衆是滿洲人，眞是滑稽之至｜滿洲人已和中國人同化了，東北民衆，大都是河北山東人居多。他們住在滿洲，只會吃滿洲飯，却不會說滿洲話；眞呌做；滿飯好吃，滿話難說。可憐一着錯滿盤都是輸。｜｜這兩句，當然是應在不抵抗的東北當局身上；一着已錯，把滿洲地盤都輸去了。滿儎芝麻打翻了，在糖餅上刮削。｜這兩句也應在東北當局身上：他把全滿喪失，便是打翻了滿儎芝麻；却想刮削到糖餅上的芝麻，補償他的損失。朝來一電，要若干萬，暮來一電，要若干萬，這便好似糖餅上的芝麻，即使刮削凈盡，也萬萬抵不過打翻的滿儎芝麻？你要芝麻，還是請你出關去跑一趟吧。</p>

<p>紅花藕中。爲避暑淸涼世界。而佳人雪藕。尤爲滌暑沁脾妙品。往昔余客綠楊城。消遣盛夏。輒一篙逗水。縱舟瘦西湖畔。擇荷陰深處。置身萬綠叢中。時則爽氣迎人。幽香入袖。披襟當風。别有天地。乃就購新出烟波嫩藕。片而食之。凉沁齒頰。足解文園渴病。而對景生情。恍見藕臂半彎。昨宵膩枕。嚼此益津津有餘味焉。</p>
<p>藕與有情人之關係。曾膾炙詩人之口。良以出汚泥而不染。保持神聖之潔白。適如有情人以高尚之戀愛。淸白之節操。打破黑暗艱難環境。立於同一地位。至玲瓏心竅。善吐情絲。合體縱分。絲猶連繫。其及有情人之（春蠶到死絲方盡）。（心有靈</p>

<p>藕於衛生有大益。城市所售。或緣出水已久。或以氣候變化。其覓色香味具足者似較難。食者盛以懸器。納浸深井。可保存原有風味不少。藕有連理狀者。爲情侶投贈妙品。不啻同心結子。碧玉連環。惟不易得。又有子孫藕。巨幹上叢生小枝。如五子羅漢。情侶每於七夕祭牛女中秋祭月時。供獻筵几。用以祈子祝福。</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>朝晨起不來早。與身體也很有關係。所以我就利用養金魚來提醒自已。我曉得每一個人的心理中。往往會得這樣。心儀了一件東西。就會一刻不忘的牽纒着。掛念着。所以我的晨起看金魚。已成爲日常功課了。</p>
<p>記得有一天早晨。俯着身子在看那一缸小魚的時候。覺得小魚的食量特别的大。給了許多紅蟲。不到一刻鐘。就都喫盡了。小魚的發育。也分快慢。同一時期化生的。不上一星期。大小差得很多。幾條大一些的。尋不到食喫。它的小肚子中還没有充量。所以。竟會得不問情由。去侵害弱小的同類。弱小的呢。游泳得不快。没法去躱避只好任其宰割。任其鯨呑。無辜的小魚兒。尾巴、眼睛、都被它喫盡了。看看僅剩一些游氣。那幾條兇很的。還是不放它過活。得寸進尺。把它肚腸心肝。骨頭渣子。喫得一絲不留。它才得意揚揚的去另追别條去了。我看得不服氣。把幾條强兇覇道的另外捉開。方纔没有魚肉同類的慘劇了。</p>
<p>後來。我一想魚。是無知無識的水産動物。尚且天性會得自相殘殺。莫怪人類了。本來。無論一個團體。一個集會。一個市鎭。推而至於一省一國以及全世界。那裏有什麽公理好講。還不是同魚類一樣的强凌弱嗎。魚是爲的没有食喫。人呢。那是範圍太廣了。但是細算起來。也全爲的衣食住問題呀。可惜。缺少像看金魚的人這樣的來給他們一件一件的調解開呢</p>

<p>唐有壬昨返滬向汪氏覆命</p>
<p>行政院長汪精衛之辭職、迭經各方懇切挽留、以汪氏態度十分堅决、毫無效果、昨晨軍事委員會委員長蔣中正、特派代表周鯁生、偕同參謀部長朱培德由京來滬、專誠挽汪、昨日上午、會同居正何應欽等、赴蒲石路汪寓訪汪、因汪未在寓、由汪夫人陳璧君女士代表接洽、聞當時汪夫人表示、謂汪之態度極爲堅决、請各部長毋庸再事挽留、應速從實際方面進行、因之各方代表、已正在請示辦法中、前晨飛漢謁蔣之政治會議秘書長唐有壬氏、昨日下午二時三十分、已乘中國航空公司飛機返滬、向汪氏覆命、各情分誌如次、</p>

<p>怠工主因　招商内河機器廠、設立在浦東陸家嘴、向來本局内河輪之修理及江海各大輪之小部分工作、均歸本廠工人修理、同時亦承修局外商輪、李國杰接任總辦以來、對於下級工人待遇、非常體恤、工資按月給付、工人亦殊滿意、惟六月份工資、由會計課給發八千元支票一紙、以現欵缺乏未予照兌、工人屢次請求、未能照付、延至十日下午、各工人相率怠工、</p>

<p>爲公司不履行加薪諾言</p>
<p>組罷委會發表罷工宣言</p>
<p>公司開除全體罷工工人公共租界英商中國公共汽車公司全體售票員等、反對公司不履行增加工資之諾言、及要求恢復被開除之工人、於昨晨實行罷工、組罷工委員會、發表宣言、提出條件、公司臨時舉行董事會、勉强維持通車佈告、將罷工工人一律革職、形勢甚爲嚴重、茲錄詳情如下、</p>
<p>醞釀經過　全體售票員反對公司壓迫、曾於去年相率罷工、奈因環境惡劣、宣告無條件復工、本年六月間、公司廠長兼車務總管蕭達特、曾與工人代表直接談判、如工人不揩油、則由公司增加工資、當時工人代表聲明增加工資後、决不揩油、本月八日起、公司將一·九·十·等三路公共汽車改爲分段售票、並通告工人云、（茲因售票員等舞弊之風、日甚一日、本廠長等已向代表等屢加諄勸、在售票員不能悛改舞弊以前、勢無加薪之可能、中日戰事之後、營業一落千丈、本公司猶照常保守全體職員、未加裁撤、此尚堪告慰諸員者也、故此後售票等苟能力自振作、永不舞弊、以襄本公司之不逮、則本公司當重加考慮、以裁酬賞、右仰售票員等一體知悉、切切此佈、廠長蕭達特）、</p>
<p>提出條件　售票員對於公司之佈告、甚爲憤激、認爲公司不履行加薪之諾言、特於前日假九雲軒菜館招待鋼匠·開車·查票·等代表、討論一致行動辦法、並提出要求條件、由各間代表共同提出、各部一致要求、簽訂罷工合同、對售票罷工表同情、茲錄其條件如下、（甲）賣票條件、（一）不得開除一個工人、畢爾所開除工人、一律馬上恢復工作、（二）增加工資到四十元、每年增加三元、（三）恢復銅板賞、按照原有數目標準發給、罷工期工資照給、（四）一律掉換新卡、以後每六個月掉換一次、（乙）查票條件、（一）增加工資最低到五十元、（二）工作不得過八小時、（三）恢復六十六號查票工作、開除畢爾、（四）停職發退職金工資一年、</p>
<p>組罷委會　前晚售票員舉行聯席會議、組織罷工委員會、内部分主席團·秘書處·宣傳部·糾察部·交際部·交通部·及基金保管委員會、當卽選出各部主任曁主席基金委員等、頒佈罷工命令、開始徵收罷工基金、售票員每人繳基金一元、决定十一日上午五時起、正式罷工、全體糾察部、一律出防、設立罷委辦事處、曁各間代表分辦事處、</p>
<p>命令罷工　罷工委員會前晚宣佈十一日起罷工後、當由交通隊分别通知、并在近水樓開緊急大會、議决、推派代表四人、向外灘總公司提出條件、同時動員、全部羣衆參加、糾察隊準備以武力驅逐破壞罷工的白俄、懇切聯合銅匠開車全部工人一致行動、茲錄罷工宣言摘要如下、帝國主義在戰後加緊壓迫工人的事實指出增加車資加緊剥削中國乘客、一致向工人和乘客進攻、復述白俄破壞工人利益、是資本的走狗、最後宣告此次罷工是爲工人本身爭條件、爲中華民國爭光榮云云、并懇切要求各界與全上海工人予實力的援助、</p>
<p>車輪停駛　昨日上午五時、全體售票員、及高麗查票、奉罷工委員會命令、實行罷工、於是各路公共汽車一路靜安寺至靶子塲、二路二洋涇橋至靶子路、三路曹家渡至南洋大學、四路靜安寺至虹橋、五路北車站至三茅閣橋、六路提藍橋至靶子塲、七路曹家渡至北新涇、九路靜安寺至電燈廠、十路曹家渡至引翔鄕、及ＡＢＣＤＥ特别快車、Ａ一專車、靜安寺至外白渡橋、因售票乏人、不得已完全停駛、</p>
<p>董事會議　英商中國公共汽車公司、於昨日上午十時、舉行臨時緊急董事會、首由廠長蕭達特報告工人罷工情形、當塲議决、（一）通告罷工工人、十一日脫班不到者一律革職、（二）設法恢復各路公共汽車行駛、以利交通、</p>
<p>公告各界　英商公共汽車公司、昨日發表公告云、竊自本公司改行分段價目以來、售票員以舞弊之機可乘、隨於今晨（八月十一日）全體脫班、而行無條件罷工、致本公司祗得行駛極少數之車輛、而使社會人士深感不便、殊覺無任愧對、在最短時間而於可能範圍以内、本公司當竭力使車務交通恢復原狀、以副各界之厚望、</p>
<p>全體革職　英商中國公共汽車公司、昨於佈告中、售票員凡於八月十一日脫班不到者、作爲開革論、其各將號衣及零星物件檄進、此佈、廠長兼車務總管蕭達特、</p>
<p>誓不復工　新聲社記者、昨晤罷工委員會委員、據發表談話云、公共汽車賣票開車查票掃地銅匠等各工人、生活痛苦異常、平均每月工資在二十元以下、自滬變事起、公司大批開除工人、如在最近九個月内、所有舊售票員、幾乎全部更換、公司復開除開車二人、查票一人、并實行改換票色、增加車資、加重工人工作、以</p>

<p>致工人忍無可忍、提出條件、公司毫無誠意接受、反準備全部開除、於是不得已宣告罷工、以促公司覺悟、現公司竟佈告革除罷工者、但罷工之人、决誓死奮鬥、不達到目的不復工、</p>
<p>勉强通車　公司於昨日下午一時起、爲維持通車、利便交通起見、由查票稽查担任售票工作、勉强行駛、一路十四輛、Ａ一、六輛、二路五輛、五路四輛、九路二十輛、Ａ二輛、Ｃ一輛、Ｂ二輛、Ｄ一輛、其餘均仍在停駛中、於下午八時、提早進廠、至於康腦脫路公司門口、由市公安局六區警士及戈登路捕房探捕駐守、以資保護、</p>
<h3 id="c156">南京路三友實業社工人與探捕衝突 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>當被捕三名即釋</p>
<p>下午向市府請願</p>
<p>社會局召集問話引翔鄕三友實業工廠宣告停業後、全體工人、要求開工、以致發生糾紛、雖經黨政機關再三調解、迄今仍未解决、工人因公司减發工人伙食費、昨晨馳往南京路門市部請願、以致與西捕發生衝突、受傷七人、當時形勢嚴重、交通斷絕、下午全體工人、赴市府請願、傍晚始散、</p>
<p>减發伙食　三友實業社滬廠停業後、曾由市府命令公司維持伙食費、經社會局决定爲每日一百二十元、迄今已發至第七星期、在第六星期時、公司認爲住廠工人、已滅少、堅持伙食費要求減爲每日八十元、經社會局詳查後、曾勸告再行勉强維持、於是全體工人、各赴社會局請願、結果社會局勸令姑先領取每日一百元、即每期七百元、前日工會夏中昭陪同社會局朱圭林赴公司領第七期伙食費時、公司堅持每期僅七百元、不允再補、</p>
<p>包圍請願　嗣工會夏中昭返廠中向工人報告後、全體工人、以區區每日一百六十元伙食費、尚不能維持一千二百餘工人之生活、今若再予減少、不啻置工人於死地、於是於昨日上午八時、自動集合二百五十餘人、擁至南京路三友實業社門市部請願、要求（一）工人伙食費、每日至少一百二十元、（二）從速開工、以維工人生計、及至上午九時、抵門市部登樓、於是樓下舖面二樓三樓、均被擠滿、門首以竹布書中英文、（我們爲吃飯問題而爭、請第三者勿來干涉）之標語、</p>
<p>發生衝突　工人請願時、老閘捕房之特别西捕經過、詢問工人在門首所掛之標語、曾得公司允許否、門市部職員、當答未得許可、係强制的、於是該西捕即往報告、隔二十分鐘後、老閘捕房特派中西武裝探捕四十餘名、馳至、將請願工人驅逐、飭工人到捕房、當時工人允全體到捕房、届時西探捕忽加阻止、並將三樓工人、驅至二樓、由二樓驅至樓下舖面、及至樓下時、工人與巡捕發生衝突、頓時痰孟椅橙悉爲武器、秩序大亂、探捕</p>
<p>見工人衆多、當狂吹警笛鳴援、</p>
<p>交通斷絕　當時工人巡捕衝突時、南京路三友門市部門首、混亂異常、附近探捕聞警馳到、當時南京路西至浙江路、東至福建路一帶、交通斷絕、各種車輛、完全被阻停駛、直至十一時許、始恢復原狀、</p>
<p>被捕即釋　衝突時、工人羅愛林等七人受傷、門市部玻璃厨窗、擊碎三塊、櫃檯被擠損壞、當時被捕工人三名、拘入捕房時、全體工人隨後、巡捕見工人離門市部、當將鐵門緊閉、禁止工人出入、被捕者至老閘捕房、經捕頭分别訊問後、以工人尚屬初次、且非主動者、當嚴予訓斥、旋即開釋、</p>
<p>請願市府　請願工人、見門市部鐵門已閉、即雇搬塲汽車、齊赴市政府請願、時已下午一時許、同時留在廠内之工人聞訊後、即馳往市府、要求（一）嚴令發給伙食費、每日一百二十元、（二）懲辦兇手、當由秘書王紹齋飭推派代表杜壽田·包伯義·宣禮和·萬權法·張庭良·陳新之·龔煥山·王學翠·秦長庚·洪美說·等十一</p>
<p>人進見、對於工人要求、允即查明辦理、並以電話通知社會局調解股主任王先靑、馳往向工人代表勸告、並解釋一切、至下午六時三十分、始由工人代表勸告工人、先行散去、</p>
<p>當局問話　該廠停業糾紛、社會局曾指定會計師查賬、連日並與市黨部及市政府會商處置辦法、以求早日解决、昨日下午、爲召集第七區棉織業工會三友實業社代表問話之時、及至下午三時、工會推派夏中昭·秦海晏·馳往、適調解股主任王先靑赴市府未回、當由朱圭林接見、作簡單之詢問、但公司代表、缺席未到、</p>
<p>公司聲明　三友實業社、昨發表聲明云、三友社因一二八案工廠被日軍佔用、旋於五月三十一日退出、即於六月二日、被工人數百名進駐、要求開工、並救濟伙食、市政府勉依請願、囑令公司暫時維持、酌予救濟、並由社會局於六月間、由公司商定、每天暫給一百二十元、如是每星期領去八百四十元、已至五星期之久、公司方面、以迭接報告、工人因日久未能解决、自動離廠者、頗不乏人、且爲時已久、與暫時意義不同、呈請社會局酌減支給、經社會局派員調查後、向公司接洽、改爲每天一百元、上星期即按此數領取、前日（十日）工會代表夏中昭·龔子愼·等、偕同社會局代表朱圭林·續領</p>
<p>去七百元、不料忽於次日即（十一日）突有工人數百名、擁至南京路門市部、玻璃窗張貼標語、當被暗探巡捕等上前干涉、幾至動武、旋被捕去三人、事後經理人到所、始知顚末、至被捕工人、聞捕房以尚屬初次、且非主動之人、隨即從寛加以開導、着令日後不得再有此項無意識之舉動、致干未便云、（工會亦有宣言發表、茲從略、）</p>

<h3 id="c206">驅逐留東學生 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>日本排斥華人，至爲嚴厲，先禁勞工入境，次拒小販商人，近留學生亦被驅逐，在過去一星期前，有留日學生田湘藩，曾被日本當局，下令驅逐，近有浙江溫州籍學生徐玉林，在日本横濱登陸，被日人禁止上岸，押令轉乘阿蘇丸輪，驅逐出境，這是應得的報酬，</p>
<p>無論何人，苟其天良未盡，稍有人心，就是閘北虹口亦不願意去，因爲日本所留遺種種殘酷的影象，歷歷在人耳目，見之令人不快，兼之東省方面，日人派武藤就關東軍司令官職，完全爲侵略統一案之實現，而熱河方面，形勢又極嚴重，本來留學日本的我國學生，在此狀態之下，倘非叔寳全無心肝，也應自動回國，現在反有赴日留學者，眞不怪爲冷血的辱國靑年，我只有像開電車夫駡幾聲（猪玀）外，尚有什麽話可說呢，</p>
<p>惟前日據某報調查，自九一八案件發生後，而前往日本留學者，雖比較從前略爲减少，但仍不乏其人，我不知若輩踏上帝國主義者之土地，作何感想，見到帝國主義者之人物，用何面目，孟子曰，人之所以異於禽獸者幾希，無非廉恥而已，人無廉恥，則禽獸不若，此種全無心肝之學生，即使他日學成回國，亦不過多幾個趙欣伯等等而止，與我國有什麽相干呢，</p>
<p>或曰，佛家云，不入虎穴，焉得虎子，現在我們只知日本之强，而不知日本之所以强，所以必須留學日本，以考察其内容，以爲我他日報復的張本，這句說話又是謝謝罷，我國自滿淸變法以後，每年前往留學日本者不知凡幾，現在我國强在那裏？對付日本的方法在那裏，？現在（急了抱佛脚）天然更是談不到，</p>
<p>所以這種留學生，非但爲我國人所不齒，就是日本人見了，也要倒味口呢，所以他們說（請你回去，不必光臨），</p>

<h3 id="c209">聲的研究 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 孟復</p>
<p>在本刊的科學欄中，所登載的大都是關於工業上應用的化學知識，對於物理方面很少研究，所以我特地把物理學</p>
<p>上關於聲的普通知識，貢獻給諸位，</p>
<p>聲音（Ｓｏｕｎｄ），除掉聽的官能壞了的人，無論是誰終是聽得到的，說來似乎没有什麽希奇，然而試問聲究竟怎樣成切的？聲音怎麽會被我們聽到？回聲又是什麽？還有關於其他一切的問題，假使諸位不能解答的話，那麽請耐心讀</p>
<p>下文！</p>
<p>當鈴搖動的時候，我們便聽到聲音，在剛搖畢的時候，試用嘴唇微觸鈴的邊緣，那就覺得鈴是震動得很利害，所以聲的成功是由於物的震動，而這震動的力量，一層一層的傳遞到接受聲音的地方－我們的耳朶，當然耳朶掩了，聲音是要减小的。</p>
<p>聲音的傳遞，全靠那充塞於大地中無處不有的空氣，現在可舉一法實騐：把閙鐘放在玻璃罩内，這時可淸晣的聽到牠的鳴聲，再用抽氣唧筒把罩内空氣抽盡，使成爲眞空，那就一些也聽不見什麽了，所以在高山上或飛機上談話，聲音很細弱，這就是因爲高處空氣稀薄的緣故。</p>
<p>除去了空氣，固體和液體都能傳聲，並且比空氣要好一些，舉幾個很普通的例在下面：把耳貼在鋼軌上，可以聽到很遠處的火車行動聲，耳伏在桌上，用手擊桌，聽起來聲音要比不伏在桌上大得多，這些都足以證明固體能傳聲，人濳在水中，可以聽到距離很遠的行船聲和種種東西在水中的擊撞聲，這也能證明液體能傳聲。</p>
<p>假使發出聲音前面遇着阻隔，聲音會立刻折回，這便成功回聲，若距離相近，回聲和本聲相混，所以便没有回聲，而本聲却可以因此增加，這就呌助聲，回聲對於戲院或會塲都是很不利的，因爲足以妨礙和擾亂聽衆們的聽覺，要免除回聲也有方法，祗要多置能吸音的物質，如用重的氈帷和絹布窗簾之類。　　至於說到聲的速度，大概要比光遲</p>
<p>緩一點。譬如打雷，終是先見電光，然後再聽見雷聲，開礮也是先見光和烟，然後再聽到礮聲，光進行的速度，大概一秒鐘可行十三萬八千英尺（合中尺爲六億五千萬尺），比聲要快五千餘倍，聲在攝氏零度和七十六個生的米突的壓力時，每秒鐘的速度是一千零八十七英尺（三百三十一米突），聲的速率的增加和溫度是成正比例的，遇溫度增加一級，聲的速率，就加二尺，大概平常可記住，聲在攝氏二十度（華氏六十八度），聲每秒鐘的速度是一千一百三十英尺，由此也可由礮聲而推知發聲處的距離，祗要從發光到發聲經過的時候，和聲的速率相乘，所得即發聲處和聞聲處的距離，歐洲大戰時，都依此法推算距離而還擊，後來都改用無烟火藥，那纔使敵人無法推測了。</p>
<p>上面講過固體和液體，傳聲比空氣要快些，聲在固體中的速度，比在空氣中要加快十五倍，在液體中要加快四倍半，似乎没有什麽希奇的聲音，研究起來，也不是很覺得奇妙麽？</p>

<h3 id="c210">改良兒童服裝提議 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 祖娥</p>
<p>關於成人的服裝改良，已有幾次在本會討論過，獨以兒童的服裝，未加注意，深爲遺憾，竊謂我國兒童生活，向鮮注意，而以服裝一項，尤少改良，因襲其舊，影響兒童的進展甚鉅，爰以改良兒童服裝提議之，深願同志者有所貢獻，</p>
<p>顧我國兒童服裝，本無新裁，只跟着成人的服裝穿着，以致一個活潑潑的孩子，常常受到服裝的拘束限止了她的天眞，譬如一個男孩子，穿了那寛褐博帶的長衣短褂，這種拖泥帶水的樣子，儘夠這孩子表示了呆蹬蹬的神氣，要他活潑也不會了，還有女孩子們，她們還根本没有知道什麽曲線美，成人們偏替她做得緊束束的旗衫，自以爲表示了這孩子的時髦，那知道孩子的身體正受着束縛，還有頭頸上圍着硬帮帮的高領，這何嘗不啻呌她戴枷呢！以是只會造成孩子文質彬彬的神氣，得不可憐？</p>
<p>本來衣服是爲禦體之用，在於已而不在於人，只求冷暖調和，淸潔衛生已矣，孩子們本没有怎樣觀感的，更根本不必去求考究，時髦，應該要打量孩子的發育或其她有無阻礙的問題上夠了，就以我見所及，權述兒童服裝的標準如下：</p>
<p>（一）活潑不受拘束　孩子本有活潑的天眞，對於發育思想都有極大影響，服成人服裝能限止她們活潑，是多大的弊端，所以兒童的服裝要改良得輕便，簡單，不但不能把身體拘束起來，並且還要藉改良的服裝，增加她們的活潑精神，</p>
<p>（二）樸素　樸素的服裝，可以養成不奢華的習慣，並且孩子們要跳要跑，樸素的衣服比華麗的總要耐久的，</p>
<p>（三）國貨衣料　鄙棄國貨，愛用舶來品的劣根性，國人差不都很普遍了，有的竟會因孩子們吵閙，就騙他們做什麽洋貨衣裳穿哩，買外國玩具哩，遂使小孩就種了這些劣根性，可嘆孰甚，所以兒童的服裝，須力求國産品，好養成不鄙棄國貨的成見。</p>
<p>（四）省工省料　兒童的服裝，須力求省工省料，式樣簡便，像有些釘密排的鈕扣，及其他複雜的裁制，不但是糜費衣料，並且多費工夫，且於兒童穿着，亦都不便。</p>
<p>（五）英勇　服裝　媚，果然能取悅於人，但終不及英勇的裝式來得使人威敬，兒童的服裝，除以上的幾種改良標準外，對於式樣的應使有英勇氣概，亦是要件，像小軍裝哩，海軍服哩，兒童穿了可有勇武的精神，對於民族的前途，未始無補？</p>
<p>拉雜書來，僅關於改良的標準幾種，自然於改良方面，未能窮其盡，尤其對於應如何改良的實施，未能述及，這些希望有心者來討論了。</p>
<p>可歎</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>二，一八，</p>
<p>婢子阿香整理我房間的時候偷偷的告訴我（老爺替小姐找了人家了，）阿香是個很伶俐的孩子，她知道我與Ｙ的事，所以偷偷把這事告訴我，本來我很懷疑，這幾天媽對我也鬼鬼祟祟的樣子，Ｙ父親也見過，說是個有爲的後生，我呌他來見父親的意思，母親總替我說過，父親當初旣不反對，現在何以變卦呢？但是我不好去問母親，寫信和他商量後，再定行止吧，</p>
<p>二，一九，</p>
<p>媽隠約其詞對我說男大須婚，女大須嫁的語，我是獨生女，媽從小就愛我如掌上珠，但是靑春時期的少女已被别一種（愛）所佔有了，媽旣吞吐的不說明，我也以校裏的功課忙，假裝讀書，騙她回房去，她還以爲我怕羞吧，Ｙ，我都爲了你，欺騙了我的媽！</p>
<p>二，二○，</p>
<p>今天他應該有信了，阿香跑了十幾次都說没有，但是禮拜他也常到我這裏的，難道爲了這問題而避嫌疑嗎？或者我寫信的時候自任信了一點，寫得太嚴重，而他發生意外嗎？如其···啊！我不忍再想了，</p>
<p>二，二一，</p>
<p>我到校裏去的時候，呌阿香留心我的信，别被媽藏了，但是終於没有信來，他到底不知怎樣了，我又是包車出進的，包車夫是父親的心腹，當然不能偷去看他，天啊！呌我如何是好呢！</p>
<p>二，二二，</p>
<p>（男子）這多麽可怕的一個名字！我因爲他們像虎狼一般的殘暴，把我寳貴的處女的愛供獻給他，是愼之又愼的，但是天下烏雅一般黑，他，可恨毒心的他，平日宜嗔宜喜的僞笑，在這封信裏完全暴露他們的罪惡，什麽自已没有自立的能力：什麽經濟仰給於他人的時候對於愛是没有自由權的，什麽恭祝我前途幸福···啊！可殺的賊！你們也像日人揭破了假面具之後是没有（人）的氣味了嗎！啊！···（以下殘缺）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Stimsons's Pulpit Diplomacy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tracing back to the January 28th Shanghai Incident, relations between China and Japan deteriorated, impacting and shaking the entire world. Japan's barbarity towards us has already been fully exposed to the world. Yet, all the nations of the world remain standing by, doing nothing. Only the United States still remains in this calm state, constantly announcing its documentary-style diplomacy. On February 24th, US Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Senator Borah. The letter, in a lengthy and elaborate manner, was broadly circulated, using a private letter to express his sincere thoughts to the authorities. By using the call to protect the Nine-Power Treaty, he aimed to warn Japan. His intention can be said to be painstaking. However, what can be done since Japan has consistently adhered to its consistent policy? In early April, Stimson once crossed the Atlantic to go to Europe. General observation all took this trip to open a new path for the Far East question. But unexpectedly, Japan still ignored him. Its attitude may become even more hardened. Mr. Stimson traveled across the ocean, making a futile trip. He could only cry out in vain.</p>
<p>Now, Rehe is in critical condition and North China is on the verge of danger. Japan is becoming increasingly aggressive towards us. At this moment, Stimson suddenly gave a speech at the New York Foreign Policy Association (The Development of the Kellogg-Briand Pact). He clearly explained the principles of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and denounced Japan's illegal actions. His words were righteous and stern, flowing endlessly. The full text has also been published to the world. It seems as if Stimson's diplomacy has changed from a documentary style to a pulpit-style, a new path.</p>
<p>Mr. Stimson's theory of the Kellogg-Briand Pact is insightful and thorough. Anyone with a considerable belief in international law will definitely be completely convinced. His words denouncing Japan said:</p>
<p>(A country's desire to wear a mask of imperialism under the guise of protecting its citizens will soon have its mask ripped off.) The words in the lines can accurately penetrate Japan's ambition and expose Japan's hypocrisy. When the words spread to the East, every sentence was harsh. No wonder Japanese officials were greatly surprised and suspicious of Mr. Stimson's speech. The spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed something about Mr. Stimson's speech:</p>
<p>(Hope that third parties will not make remarks or actions that may make the situation more serious. Such remarks only increase the difficulty for the Japanese government to control public opinion. Japan has decided to establish a buffer state between China and Russia.) Japanese newspapers also unanimously expressed indignation towards Mr. Stimson's speech. Mr. Stimson's speech seems to have provoked a major aversion in both the Japanese government and the public. Whether Japan will lodge a protest with the United States is not yet known. However, Japan's arrogant invasion of us has already been expressed in a few words by this Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson. The so-called decision to establish a buffer state between China and Russia, what a firm tone. What a tough attitude towards the United States. I ask, what can Stimson do? Therefore, Mr. Stimson's remarks can only win the applause of the audience under the pulpit. The failure of Mr. Stimson's documentary diplomacy is still vivid in our minds. We do not believe that his pulpit diplomacy can shift the peace in East Asia. Alas, the changes in the situation in the Pacific are becoming more urgent every day. Our great land of China has become food on someone else's chopping board. Although Stimson's words are enough to startle the Far East, they cannot slightly reduce Japan's arrogance. Looking around, the central government of our country is unstable, and the leaders are scattered. Faced with the urgent situation in the international arena, how can we resist foreign aggression? How can we save the country?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Military and Political Preparations in North China are Ready to be Transferred <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Plans to Leave Beiping for Other Places Within Ten Days</p>
<p>Military Affairs will be the Responsibility of Wan Fulin and Yu Xuezhong</p>
<p>Zhang Told Foreign Reporters That He is Determined to Resign from All Positions and Travel Overseas</p>
<p>The Troops Under His Command Belong to the Country and Should Obey Government Orders</p>
<p>Currently Negotiating with Chiang Kai-shek on How to Maintain Public Security in North China After Resigning</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang plans to leave Beiping within ten days. The location is undecided. The central government will approve his resignation to fulfill his wishes. The military and political affairs of the North will be temporarily presided over by the central committee members in Beiping to transition. The generals of North China will respect the intentions of Chiang and Zhang and will not express opinions on politics. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The central government will approve the resignations of Wang and Zhang. There are rumors that He Yingqin will remotely lead the Ping Sui Pacification Director, or that Wan Fulin and Yu Xuezhong will be the deputy directors, but these are not accurate. The Military Reorganization Committee has decided to enrich its internal affairs. The daily affairs of the committee may be handled by a standing committee. Zhang will go to the Western Hills after arranging everything and prepare to go abroad. Han Fuqu sent a telegram to Beiping, advising Zhang not to have any thoughts of retreat and to jointly maintain the overall situation. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin hosted a banquet for the generals at his home tonight to discuss the issues of retaining Zhang and maintaining public security in North China in detail again. After Zhang leaves Beiping, military affairs will be the responsibility of Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Rong Zhen, and others. Zhang Qun will also stay in Beiping to coordinate everything. The most important thing at the moment is that the troops continue to train as usual and the Rehe issue. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang visited Zhang Qun tonight and talked for a long time. Xu is scheduled to leave Beiping and return to Shanxi within a day or two. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person will go to Chengde to visit Tang Yulin to discuss the current situation within the next few days. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zhang's Talk to Foreign Reporters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Several foreign reporters visited Zhang Xueliang tonight. Zhang wore a white silk shirt and sat in front of a long table. The table was filled with fruits, tea, and snacks. The electric fan was blowing. Zhang answered all the questions. After Zhang briefly described the past events that led to the current situation, he said emphatically that he was determined to resign from all positions and go overseas. He believed that his resignation would be accepted by the central government. Zhang said that since the September 18th Incident, he had repeatedly thought about resigning, but he was always stopped by his sense of responsibility to the country. However, the current development has made him decide that it is not appropriate to delay any longer. He is a soldier and works under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, the commander of the Chinese armed forces. Therefore, when he decided to resign, he thought it was appropriate to consult the commander-in-chief first. He is currently exchanging opinions with Chiang Kai-shek on his resignation and the best way to maintain public security in North China after his resignation. When asked about the transfer of military power, Zhang replied that the old idea of military power being granted to the commander has passed. As far as he himself is concerned, he believes that the troops under his command belong to the country. Therefore, he intends to set an example for the soldiers of the whole country and let the whole country know that the troops under Zhang Xueliang's command do not belong to him personally, but to the country and should obey the government's orders. However, he and the troops under his command have deep feelings. There are many of his close friends and classmates in the army, and the rest are people he respects. Therefore, he is naturally deeply concerned about their happiness and is eager to protect their future when he leaves office and negotiates the transfer of military power. For this reason, he must carefully consider how to ensure that the troops under his command for many years will not be disbanded as a result of the transfer. He especially believes that the troops belong to the country and hopes that they will share his views and follow the example he has set. The solution to this problem may provide a solution to the currently considered reorganization of the Northwest Pacification Envoy. It may be replaced by a new organization, taking advantage of the changing situation caused by the current development. When asked who the successor will be, Zhang declined to discuss the matter. He then mentioned the issue of traveling abroad. Zhang was very excited and said that after the preparations for the transfer of military power according to the instructions of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek are completed, he can freely realize his extravagant wish to travel abroad. He has been in politics for more than ten years and feels a little tired. He wants to travel to new lands, increase his knowledge, broaden his horizons, and feels that changing the environment is very beneficial to his body and can be a stimulant after a long political career. He has long cherished the desire to study at a British university, especially Oxford or Cambridge. In addition, he also wants to visit the three countries that have struggled to gain a new life, namely Italy, Turkey, and Germany. After visiting these three countries, he may have to go to Russia to investigate the situation in that country. However, his main purpose is to live in France for several years. Zhang said here, then smiled at the reporters and said, "Living in France is very expensive for someone with a large family like me." When asked if he would travel to the United States, Zhang did not seem very enthusiastic. He said that of course he could not abandon the United States, but he felt that it was better to live in Europe because it was convenient to study everything, especially the political changes of the new era. When asked if his determination to resign and go abroad could change, Zhang replied that his determination was firm, but he could not forget his responsibility to the country. Moreover, as long as he is in office, he is responsible for the public security of North China. He believes that the whole problem can be solved in three to five days, and the future of North China can be placed on a more stable foundation. Then he can resign and go abroad. Zhang concluded by saying that if the situation allows, he plans to stay abroad for three to five years to improve his health, broaden his knowledge, and increase his knowledge of the new countries, which are his three long-cherished wishes.

<h3 id="e4">Central Standing Committee Discusses the Proposal to Retain Wang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 11th, Secretary-General Ye submitted the telegram from Committee Members He and Ju reporting on the effort to retain President Wang. The telegram stated that there had been no concrete results in the effort to retain Wang in recent days, and requested instructions on whether to return to Nanjing or continue to persuade in Shanghai. It was then decided to send a telegram to He and Ju to temporarily return to Nanjing to make a detailed report in order to discuss further effective ways to retain Wang, or to add one or two more people to go to Shanghai to retain him. Furthermore, the issue of Zhang Xueliang's resignation was not discussed on the 11th. A certain committee member told reporters after the meeting that this matter should be discussed by the Political Affairs Conference. As for whether Chairman Chiang will come to Nanjing at the moment, there is still no official telegram. (11th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Expected to be Resolved Within a Week <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Mengyu said that Committee Members He and Ju telegraphed that President Wang's resignation is still very firm. The central government will telegram He and Ju to return to Nanjing to discuss further effective ways to retain Wang. Although the central government has repeatedly discussed this issue in recent days, there has been no concrete solution so far. At this time of internal and external troubles, the central government cannot be suspended for long and it is expected to be resolved within a week. This is not about President Wang's personal advancement or retreat, but a major key to the entire political reform. The central government should take the country and the nation as its position and seek a proper solution. The rumor that Chairman Chiang telegraphed his resignation has not been received by the central government and is considered inaccurate. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Successor Has Not Yet Been Determined <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 11th. According to his talk, although Wang's resignation is firm, the central government is relying on him and the public is hoping for him. He still needs to seek other remedies to save him. Wang once asked Mr. Cai Ziming to take on the difficult task, but Cai still insisted that Wang be responsible for maintaining it. Therefore, the successor is difficult to determine before the central government approves Wang's resignation. The central government is considering whether to approve Zhang Xueliang's resignation, so the successor has not been determined. The leaders of various ministries and commissions in Shanghai are resigning together on one hand and discussing ways to retain Wang according to the central government's wishes on the other hand. The date of return to Nanjing has not yet been determined. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Lushan from Wuhan to visit Chairman Lin to discuss the issue of Wang and Zhang's resignations, and telegraphed to invite Wang to Lushan for a trip. It is not yet known whether Wang will go. It is heard that He Yingqin and Song Ziwen will return to Nanjing on the 13th, or fly to Lushan by plane from Shanghai. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Luoyang) After the resignation of various ministers, Chairman Lin sent an urgent telegram yesterday to console them. The original telegram said, (Omissions) I am aware of your good telegrams. President Wang's resignation has been answered with a telegram of sincere retention. You have assisted the central government and your meritorious service is evident. The situation is difficult and relies on your great relief. The requested resignation should not be discussed. I hope you will continue to serve and live up to your expectations. Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, gray seal. (11th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting arrived in Jinan this morning. Han went to the station to greet them. Shen and Ge talked about coming to Jinan to meet Chairman Han, and it is undecided whether to go to Beiping. Han talked about Chiang sending a telegram yesterday, instructing him to maintain the overall situation. The specific measures for the aftermath of North China were not mentioned, and are probably still in negotiation. Now it is like a great craftsman building a building. The axes and materials are all in hand. How to use and place them has not yet been determined. The North China Political Affairs Committee telegraphed that Zhang has decided to go to the Western Hills. I telegraphed Zhang to advise him to postpone his departure. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wei Daofeng came to Jinan from Qingdao this morning to meet Han and will go to Beiping the night after tomorrow. Shen Honglie is scheduled to go to Beiping early on the 12th to report the results of his meeting with Han to Zhang. (11th Dispatch)</p>

Tang Yulin has two-thirds of his family property in Shenyang and could not bear to sacrifice it, so he negotiated conditions with the Japanese army. The Japanese army heard that Zhu Jiqing was about to arrive in Rehe and ordered Tang Yulin to stop him.

<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese news today, the volunteer army within South Manchuria has a method of avoiding Japanese aircraft reconnaissance. The volunteer army does not wear plain clothes, but wears blue uniforms to avoid detection. They lie down when Japanese aircraft arrive and only get up after the Japanese aircraft have left. When possible, the volunteer army launches attacks at night. This tactic has exhausted the Japanese. Hundreds of villages along the railway line, suspected by Japanese aircraft of harboring the volunteer army, have been destroyed by bombing. Residents in this environment have no choice but to abandon their homes and flee, so Shanhaiguan has now become a collection of refugees. The volunteer army is also experiencing difficulties due to the dispersal of the residents. They often go without food or drink for several days, but they are not discouraged and are still launching attacks on the Japanese and the (Manchukuo) mixed forces in many places, and destroying traffic on the South Manchuria Railway. The Japanese troops in Jinzhou and Xinmintun have been surrounded and are only relying on aircraft for communication. Both places are likely to be captured soon, and the number of volunteer soldiers nearby is increasing daily. It is heard that there are 2,000 volunteer soldiers now surrounding Benxihu, where the Japanese-operated coal mine is in a precarious situation. It is heard that the Japanese have hurriedly shipped Korean soldiers from the Anfeng Railway to relieve the siege. Japanese sources said that the volunteer army's attack on Shenyang has been driven back, but the Japanese seem to admit to suffering heavy losses and the dangerous situation has not been reduced, because the volunteer army's momentum is very strong. The Nantai Power Plant, which supplies electricity to the South Manchuria Railway, has been destroyed, according to Chinese news. Fighting is now taking place in Yingkou Goubangzi and the Tongliao routes of Dahushan. The Japanese in Yingkou are increasingly panicked and plan to leave the country if necessary. (11th Reuters)</p>

<p>Confidential Talk for One Hour Discussing the Overall Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>Stimson Indicates Determination to Cooperate with the League of Nations</p>
<p>Debuchi Denies Intention to Use Force to Occupy Pingjin</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 10th - The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, met with the US Secretary of State, Stimson, today for a confidential talk lasting one hour. After the meeting, Debuchi told people that he did not ask Stimson to explain his statements during the meeting, but Debuchi admitted that he and Stimson discussed the overall situation in the Three Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 11th - The Times' Washington correspondent telegraphed that although the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, denied receiving instructions from Tokyo to inquire with US Secretary of State Stimson about the dispute over the Kellogg-Briand Pact speech, Debuchi has acknowledged that the speech has naturally become a problem because Stimson insists that the Kellogg-Briand Pact is related to the Manchurian situation. Stimson has now reaffirmed that the United States continues to oppose Japan's control of Manchuria or any other part of China by force, and the United States is determined to do its utmost to cooperate with the League of Nations to uphold the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Lytton Commission's report. The correspondent also said that Debuchi is scheduled to depart from Washington for home within the next week. Although news from the Japanese Foreign Ministry proves that Debuchi's trip was recalled by the government, Debuchi claims that he hopes to return to his post this winter. During the meeting between Debuchi and Stimson, he denied Japan's intention to occupy Pingjin. He also informed Stimson that General Muto was appointed as the Special Envoy to Manchuria, Commander of the Kwantung Army, and Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, stating that these positions were combined in one person because misunderstandings often occurred between Japanese consuls and military authorities in Manchuria.</p>

Neutrality is only a term opposite to war. Since war is illegal, the right to neutrality is also not established. International legal experts now believe that the Kellogg-Briand Pact has changed the doctrine of neutrality.</p>

<p>Economic Recession Reaches Its Peak</p>
<p>Government Trapped in a Dilemma</p>
<p>Domestic Capitalists Only Know How to Speculate for Their Own Benefit</p>
<p>Rural Ideology Increasingly Leans Towards Social Revolution</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 6th - When the Seiyukai suddenly seized power last December, it first reintroduced the gold embargo, allowing those who anticipated the reintroduction of the embargo and speculated heavily in US dollars to become rich overnight. It is reported that the net profit reached 80 million yen. In reality, this huge sum was gained by a small number of speculators and lost by the majority of the people. Those who paid attention at the time predicted that once the truth was revealed, public resentment would boil over and erupt. This prediction came true. Even though Inoue and Dan Takuma were innocent, the main reason for their assassinations was that they were seen as representatives of capitalists who speculated for their own benefit. There is no doubt about this. After the Seiyukai reintroduced the gold embargo, it was said that trade would flourish, but it was predicted that even if trade could flourish, it would only be temporary and fleeting. This prediction also came true. The Seiyukai's policy ultimately failed to save the country from recession. Even after Saito succeeded in forming a cabinet in May, the economic recession has not abated slightly. The general situation is getting worse and worse. The government is now forced to convene a special session of the Diet, scheduled to convene on August 23, to decide on rural relief measures and other plans to deal with the national crisis. According to a survey by education authorities, about 200,000 schoolchildren are suffering from malnutrition due to their parents' poverty. Thousands of schoolteachers have not been paid for months or have only received part of their salaries, because local coffers are empty. Thousands of men, women, old and young in the countryside have nothing to eat and are forced to eat tree bark and grass roots. Provincial governors recently gathered in Tokyo to complain to the Prime Minister and government officials about the plight of their territories. Local officials would rather underestimate the disaster situation in their areas than exaggerate it, but what they said was also true, so the tragic news that has been circulating privately in recent days is also credible. The government is now full of promises to do its best to remedy the situation, knowing that if it does not tackle this difficult task, there will be serious potential consequences. However, the Diet cannot vote on funding that is nowhere to be found. Even if the government issues bonds, there is a limit to how much it can issue without harming the country's credit. Therefore, the authorities are in a difficult position. It would be truly fortunate if the country could pass relief measures without experiencing disturbances. A tense atmosphere is already present. Although the Seiyukai has representatives in the current cabinet, it is still dissatisfied with what the government is doing, accusing the government of being incompetent and threatening that if the government does not adopt the Seiyukai's far-reaching proposals, the Seiyukai will find a way to take action. What it advocates is that the government monopolize rice, the state control fertilizer, the government purchase 90 million pounds of summer and autumn silk cocoons, the national treasury pay the salaries of elementary school teachers, and abolish land donations and house donations in rural, fishing, and mountain villages. However, it is not only the Seiyukai that criticizes the current government. Farmers who have suffered for a long time are gradually taking organized action. It is expected that when the Diet convenes, petitioners will flock to the capital. The government sympathizes with the purpose of this action, but is deeply concerned that its development will go beyond the bounds and hinder law and order. Therefore, it has to prepare sufficient police maintenance measures in advance. Recently, police chiefs from various provinces gathered to discuss in detail the methods to be adopted to suppress the actions of the left and right wings and the uproar of the farmers. The most obvious is the unrest in the agricultural areas. In many areas, landlords are afraid of incurring the anger of tenants and dare not collect rent from them. Landlords are mostly only middle-class families who rely entirely on land rent income to support themselves, but now they are greatly affected. Their plight is no less than that of the tenants. Japanese farmers bear national and local taxes two times higher than merchants and three times higher than manufacturers, and the protectionist tariffs promulgated by the government make the burden on farmers and workers heavier and unbearable. The farmers' resentment for the delay in relief has been intensifying for years. However, there is no anti-imperial element in the farmers' uproar. What they hate are the landlords, capitalists, and political parties that represent their interests. For this reason, the farmers are inclined to cooperate with the extreme right-wing restorationists and nationalists, because these two factions demand the suppression of landlords, capitalists, and politicians, and the return of their land and assets to the Emperor, so that they can be redistributed, so that each cultivator has his own land and each person without assets gets his own area.</p>

<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 11th - The resignation of Shiga Wataru, the Vice Minister of Communications, and the removal theory of Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, are all expressions of dissatisfaction with the current government by disgruntled elements of the Seiyukai. These radicals are dissatisfied with the self-restraint theory of President Suzuki and believe that the current cabinet, which does not do things thoroughly, is incapable of shouldering the burden of extraordinary times and should overthrow the current cabinet and form a truly cooperative cabinet.</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 11th - Shiga, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Communications, resigned because he was dissatisfied with the government's policy towards the current situation. As a result of the government's evaluation of his successor, it was decided to appoint Makino Ryoso of the Seiyukai.</p>

<p>China United News Agency Tokyo, 11th - The National League of the Adachi Party of Japan held a special committee on the Manchurian issue at 3:00 PM today, deciding to issue a statement requesting the government to recognize the puppet state, and scheduled to send Adachi Nakano to visit Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Uchida, and Army Chief Araki tomorrow to personally seek recognition. The reasons for their advocacy of recognition are (1) to settle the hearts of the people in the puppet state, (2) to express Japan's determination, and (3) to consolidate the relations between Japan and Manchuria and promote economic construction. Originally, Adachi was a representative of aggressive politicians. In his youth, he went to Korea, led a team of Japanese ruffians to break into the Korean palace and assassinate Queen Min. The matter was exposed, and he was imprisoned. After being released from prison, he entered politics and is connected to the bloodline of the Japanese ruffians in the Eastern Province today.</p>

<p>Rumor of the Rebel Leader Fleeing to Portugal; Arrested</p>
<p>People in Various Places Hold Parades in Support of the Republic</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 11th - According to an official announcement, General Sanjurjo, the rebel leader of the Seville restorationists, is said to have fled to Portugal after the rebels surrendered to government troops.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 11th - This afternoon, it was officially confirmed that rebel leader Sanjurjo has been captured in Huelva. A large contingent of police officers has been dispatched in cars to escort him to the capital. It is widely believed that this move indicates that the government has effectively taken control of the situation. Public and private sectors are expected to quickly return to normal. Well-informed sources claim that the panic is over and there is no cause for concern.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 11th - The restoration rebellion has collapsed. There are reports that its leader, General Sanjurjo, has been arrested. After Sanjurjo fled early this morning, local officials took over the city without incident. Telephone communications have now been restored, and it is known that the incident in the city was not significant, with no reported casualties. After occupying the city in the name of restoration, Sanjurjo only encountered unarmed resistance. After Sanjurjo imprisoned the provincial governor, the mayor, and several council members, he appeared complacent. Subsequently, the entire city declared a general strike to resist. A mob burned down a wealthy landowners' club. Currently, the provincial governor and mayor have been reinstated. The military continues to adopt a non-resistant attitude. Many civil and military officials involved in the rebellion have fled. It is reported that in many places, the people have risen up to resist the restorationists. The restorationist organizations and newspapers have been shut down. Military tribunals are currently investigating the rebellion. There have been enthusiastic demonstrations in Barcelona in support of the Republic. It is believed that if this rebellion had succeeded, Catalonia would have declared itself an independent republic.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 10th - Former Deputy Minister of War, General Goded, who was dismissed for resisting the Republic during military exercises, has now been arrested. Seville is cut off from the capital because the telegraph office has been occupied by the military. A loyal telegraph operator claimed to have sent a telegram at the risk of being shot. He was reportedly shackled and closely guarded by security, but he pretended to be playing with the keys of the telegraph machine and managed to send the telegram. Currently, it is not possible to communicate directly with Seville, so the news about the area is contradictory. One report says General Sanjurjo has been arrested, while another says he is besieged in his headquarters. There are also reports that loyal troops have assisted the people in restoring the city's governance. Eight right-wing newspapers in Madrid have been suspended indefinitely. In addition to General Goded, three other generals, including Ferrant, and eighty others, mostly young people, have been arrested. Various labor unions have gathered to support the government, declaring their willingness to make any sacrifice to defend the Republic. Premier Azaña broadcast a speech on the radio, urging the people to remain calm and avoid demonstrations, as they could easily lead to serious disturbances. According to telegrams from various provinces, the people are enthusiastically supporting the Republic. Republican demonstrators in Madrid clashed with a non-violent parade of communists. The republicans seized the communists' red flag and arrested the party members, sending them to the police station. Radical opposition leader Cortes visited the Premier and declared that his party was willing to provide full support.</p>

<p>Negotiations to Form a Cabinet are Underway</p>
<p>All of Germany Celebrates the Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Constitution</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 10th - Premier Papen will likely submit his cabinet's resignation to President Hindenburg tomorrow, so the President can entrust Hitler with reorganizing the new cabinet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 10th - The most important issue in the minds of the German people is whether Hitler will replace Papen as Premier. Newspaper commentaries and street gossip are all about this. Since German President Hindenburg returned to the capital from his villa today, the time for the final decision has arrived. It is reported that the President will remain in the capital temporarily, until Papen and the leaders of the right-wing and Centre parties have thoroughly discussed the reorganization of the cabinet. Then, he will return to Newtec Villa. After arriving in the capital today, the President immediately met with Papen to report on the latest political situation and the week-long negotiations between Defense Minister Schleicher and representatives of the National Socialist Party. It is reported that Papen will first meet with the leaders of the Centre Party tomorrow, and then personally negotiate directly with Hitler. The Vossische Zeitung, a democratic newspaper, claims that Premier Papen is eager to know the Centre Party's attitude towards admitting several members of the National Socialist Party into the cabinet. Although the right-wing has 270 seats in the parliament, it cannot gain a majority without the Centre Party's active support or tacit endorsement. However, there is no doubt that the National Socialist Party is determined to support Hitler's rise to power as Premier. Newspapers such as the Deutsche Weltwirtschaftliche Zeitung are saying that the day Hitler succeeds Papen as head of the cabinet is not far off. Today, various newspapers published a rumor that Hitler and Papen are expected to reach an agreement, with the portfolios of Minister of the Interior and Minister of Communications given to key members of Hitler's party, while Papen remains Premier or concurrently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The current Minister of Foreign Affairs, Neurath, would return to his post as Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The other cabinet members would remain unchanged, maintaining the cabinet's detached status. However, if the National Socialist Party is determined to take the position of Premier, the situation will be different. There may be major developments in the coming days. Although new orders have been issued with severe penalties to curb terrorist acts in various places, there is no sign of a decrease.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 11th - Today is the anniversary of the promulgation of the Weimar Constitution in Germany. Various republican organizations across the country are holding celebrations. The government celebration in the Reichstag in the capital was the most grand. President Hindenburg and all cabinet members and social figures attended. The ceremony was very simple. After President Hindenburg took his seat, Premier Papen stood up and gave a speech, tracing the circumstances of the constitution-making after the armistice and the hardships and struggles the people had endured over the past thirteen years. He then described the recent political developments, saying that he had to devote all his efforts to the transformation of the country. The first step should be to improve the electoral law, in the hope of reducing the number of political groups in the parliament. Otherwise, there will be a risk of not being able to form a solid coalition cabinet. Another major drawback of the current system is that responsibility is borne by groups rather than individuals. The solution is to add a chamber to the parliament that will not be dominated by party politics or electoral sentiment. Furthermore, the relationship between the federal government and the state governments should also be reformed. Based on the experience gained over the years, the thorny administrative situation when the federal government and the Prussian government, controlled by opposing parties, implement conflicting policies is clear evidence. Finally, he quoted Bismarck's famous saying (parties must serve the country and not dominate the country) to encourage everyone.</p>

Britain has agreed to take measures to curb dumping. Regarding the import of British goods into Canada, Canada has agreed to concessions on steel, and Canada will also consider reducing its import duties on British textiles. It is rumored that Britain is prepared to discuss preferential treatment for the import of wheat and other goods into Britain to show its gratitude.</p>

<p>To Meet with Han Fu-qu on Important Matters Concerning North China, Jinan Correspondence: After President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei resigned and went to Shanghai, the Pacification Commissioner of Peiping, Zhang Xueliang, also decisively retired based on Wang's telegram. Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fu-qu is the center of gravity in North China. Therefore, Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially dispatched his representative stationed in Peiping, Chiang Bo-cheng, to Jinan to meet with Han for consultations. Chiang Bo-cheng boarded the 201 train on the Pingpu Line from Peiping on the 8th and arrived in Jinan at 9:00 am on the 9th. Han Fu-qu, heads of various provincial government departments, and members all went to the station to welcome him. After Chiang got off the train, he shook hands with each of the welcomers as a courtesy. He then rode in the same car with Han Fu-qu to the Central Bank and talked for over an hour before they parted. This reporter made a special visit to Chiang Bo-cheng and Han Fu-qu, and recorded their conversations as follows:</p>
<p>Chiang Bo-cheng said: President Wang suddenly resigned on the 6th. Director Zhang, who was responsible for military affairs in North China, also resigned in succession. Commander-in-Chief Chiang believes that at this critical time, when Rehe and Yuyu are under pressure, the successive retirements of Wang and Zhang may affect the overall situation in North China. Therefore, he sent me to Shandong to consult with Chairman Han, as he is the center of gravity in North China and is of great importance. I have just met with Mr. Han, and he has expressed that he will obey Commander-in-Chief Chiang as always. He will follow Commander-in-Chief Chiang's opinion at all times and in all matters. Regarding President Wang's resignation, he will send a telegram earnestly persuading him to return to the capital. As for Director Zhang's resignation, he deeply admires his open-minded attitude. As for Commander-in-Chief Chiang's opinion on this matter, I am far away in Peiping and have not heard anything yet. Last night, when I boarded the train in Peiping,</p>
<p>I called Director Zhang from the station, but he had not yet received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang. However, Director Zhang's resignation telegram had already been sent. According to the conversation when Zhang met with me, he was suffering and had no way out. President Wang ordered him to resign, which was exactly what he wanted. The report of demanding military funds is not true. Zhang may send a telegram to explain. The North China Political Affairs Commission will also send a telegram to testify. Important generals in North China, such as Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, Chuan Zuoyi, Pang Bingxun, Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Zuoxiang, and Wang Shuchang, are all in Peiping and have not expressed their opinions on Zhang's resignation. As for Wang's resignation, they agree with Zhang and will send a telegram to retain him. Before the Central Government approves Zhang's resignation, military affairs will be handled by the Military Affairs Reorganization Committee, and political affairs will be handled by the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, respectively. Peiping, Tianjin, Rehe, and Shanhaiguan are as calm as usual. The Central Government will definitely have a solution in the shortest possible time and will never allow the overall situation in North China to be affected. Commander-in-Chief Chiang is very concerned about North China. After I meet with Chairman Han, I will report Han's suggestions to Commander-in-Chief Chiang by telegram. I will stay in Jinan for about three or four days. After completing my mission, I will return to Peiping.</p>
<p>Han Fu-qu said: The resignation of President Wang and Director Zhang was sudden. I am not yet clear about the truth, so I cannot express any opinion. However, at this time when the country is in trouble, I personally believe that the pillars of the country should not resign hastily, giving the enemy an opportunity. I plan to send a telegram to President Wang, earnestly retaining him and asking him to return to the capital as soon as possible to resume his duties, so as to avoid a situation where no one is responsible at the center. In the past two days, neither Commander-in-Chief Chiang nor Director Zhang have sent telegrams to Jinan. Even if Director Zhang resigns, it will certainly not affect the overall situation in North China. However, at a time when both foreign and domestic troubles are pressing, it is really worrying.

<h3 id="e75">The Xiao Case Dispute in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, Escalates <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>He Jian Firmly Opposes Sending the Case to the Capital</p>
<p>Military Officers Jointly Request On-Site Execution, Changsha Correspondence: The Communist Party case in Ningxiang County is escalating. Division commanders and security regiment commanders from various counties have sent telegrams requesting a local resolution to the case. Some have even declared that if the case is sent to the Central Government, their past efforts in clearing the countryside and suppressing bandits would be in vain, and they would stop clearing the countryside in the future. He Jian himself has also declared to the people that he will never send the case to the capital, and has sent Chief of Staff Liu Yinggu to Wuhan to explain to Chiang Kai-shek why Xiao Xuetai cannot be sent to</p>

<p>The case cannot be sent to Beijing for trial. The Provincial Party Headquarters has sent another telegram to the Central Government requesting it to expedite the transfer. The Central Military Commission sent another telegram on the 5th urging the transfer, but He Jian has not yet replied. This case is about to escalate from a local party and government dispute in Hunan to a problem between the Central Government and Hunan. The telegrams from He Jian and the six division commanders to the Central Government are recorded below:</p>
<p>He Jian's telegram to the Central Government: To the Executive Committee of the Central Party Headquarters in the Capital, Military Commission Chairman Chiang: The evidence in the Xiao Xuetai case in Ningxiang is conclusive. I proposed a personal inquiry and jointly interrogated with the Fang and Hong committees, and all confessed. Now I received a telegram, and I was about to send it. Suddenly, more than 3,000 representatives of the people of Hunan, Zhou Naigui, Chen Baozhang, Ding Ziqin, Yuan Yousheng, Guan Tianhua, Xie Xun, Hu Yiru, Tang Gan, and hundreds of people and party members from Ningxiang surrounded the Fang and Hong committees and this headquarters to petition, making three requests: (1) Please forward to the Central Government to withdraw the order to escort Xiao Xuetai to Beijing for trial by the court. (2) Please expedite the resolution</p>
<p>of this case. (3) Do not differentiate between special and ordinary categories of anti-communism. Kneeling and weeping, they were extremely excited. Because of the firm public opinion, I could not disobey. I replied that the transfer would be delayed and reported the situation. At the same time, I received telegrams from the security regiment commanders of Xiangxiang, Hengyang, Wugang, Ningyuan, Daoxian, Xintian, Yuanjiang, and other counties, requesting a swift on-site execution. Also, all the staff of this headquarters stated that according to the confidential order No. 11 of the National Government on August 19, military agencies have full authority to handle communist cases. Those who have already been sent to the court must be quickly handed back to the military agencies for handling. Only in the Xiao Xuetai case is there a special transfer to Beijing, designated for trial by the court. The law has lost equality, and the anti-communism agencies are the same as being set up in vain. They requested to resign en masse. Furthermore, the division commanders Wang Dongyuan and others jointly sent telegrams urging that if it is not quickly handled according to the law, it will affect the future of the anti-communist campaign. It is not a trivial matter. How should it be handled? Please instruct us to follow. Hunan Anti-Communist Commander He Jian, stamped.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government from the Six Division Commanders: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan President Wang, Hankou Military Commission Chairman Chiang, Commander-in-Chief He, Changsha Central Committee Member Fang, Committee Member Hong, Chairman He, Commander-in-Chief He, Anti-Communist Commander He: The Ning case has occurred for a long time, and the hesitation in resolving it has caused alarm far and wide. We believe that the Communist Party is rampant and poisonous, and the whole country is in turmoil. They unscrupulously resort to the schemes of demons and goblins and are accustomed to taking advantage of loopholes. A slight oversight will fall into their trap. Hidden dangers will grow and endanger the foundation of the country. Now, the chief culprit in the Ning case, Xiao Xuetai, and others, have had their evidence published by the Hunan Anti-Communist Command, and the charges are clear. The country has established laws; how can they be allowed to escape cunningly? We are ordered to suppress the reds, and our responsibilities are important. Our subordinates are all requesting, and the public is indignant. We dare to telegraph, asking for a decisive decision, and approve the on-site execution of the criminals according to the law, in order to comfort the sacrificed martyrs and encourage the determination to eliminate communism. We are sincerely requesting and beg for your consideration. Division Commander of the 15th Division Wang Dongyuan, Division Commander of the 10th Division Peng Weiren, Division Commander of the 19th Division Li Jue, Division Commander of the 62nd Division Tao Guang, Division Commander of the 63rd Division Chen Guangzhong, Division Commander of the 34th Division Chen Quzhen, stamped.

<h3 id="e76">Continued Interrogation in the Niu Lan Case (Continued) <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Niu Lan Displays Cunning, Obstinacy, and Evades Questions (Extensive) Money is something everyone has; having money is not in itself harmful to the Republic of China. There is still much evidence, including a proposal from February 10, 1931, according to the Western calendar. The content of the proposal suggests that it is based on reports from the Communist Parties of Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui, and is a recommendation to the central organ of the Communist Party. It states that the party and its Fourth Army Independent Division plan to establish Soviet sub-districts in the southwest of Anhui and the northeast of Hubei, train the Red Army and peasant activists, and suppress the White Army (referring to the Chinese Kuomintang army). The next paragraph also states that before this task is completed, the Red Army should not advance towards the Pinghan Railway Line. Furthermore, there are details on how to mobilize and organize the Red Army, incite workers and peasants near the railway, provoke class struggle, and create red terror, etc. There is also another proposal, which is quite lengthy, recorded on pages 131 to 137 of Volume 2 of the case exhibits." At this point, the original document was handed to Niu for review. After reviewing it, Niu said, "There are ink marks on this document. What is the expert's opinion on this handwriting?" (Presiding Judge:) "We are studying the content first." (Niu:) "I now demand that the expert's opinion be presented. If it is not, it constitutes a rejection of the defendant." (Presiding Judge:) "This document has not been authenticated yet." (Niu:) "The indictment states that I wrote it. I ask the court to present the expert's opinion." (Presiding Judge:) "This exhibit has several points: (1) It mentions dispatching a special comrade to Nanking to contact soldiers and mechanics in the Aviation Administration, and alienate and entice them to disobey central command; (2) At the Shanghai Arsenal, small teams must be organized, with young party members as core members; (3) Regarding the newly organized troops and guards of Chiang Kai-shek, assign ten to fifteen comrades to contact them, and simultaneously expand the Nanking team. Another task is to instigate military rebellion. Furthermore, there is a letter from the Hubei Eastern District Special Committee to you, stating that the Red Army's military actions are slow, and a decision has been made to use part of the army to fight the enemy and another part to create chaos." At this point, Niu requested the court to note that this document was sent from Hubei and typed, but now has ink writing on it, and asked for it to be authenticated. Niu also claimed that none of the letters were signed. (Presiding Judge:) "There is also evidence: a letter from the Central Bureau to the Central District. The letter states that the Seventh and Twentieth Armies in Jiangxi are victorious, but lack 'frames'; send some over. What does this mean?" (Niu:) "This document is unsigned, like the other documents." (Presiding Judge:) "What are 'frames'? Are they people, or weapons?" Niu did not answer. At this point, the Presiding Judge added, "There is also evidence: a letter to the Eastern Secretariat of the Comintern, containing phrases like 'Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial policies,' 'Overthrow the Provisional Constitution,' and 'Overthrow the bandit suppression propaganda.' There is also evidence of the Revolutionary Workers' Union's activities in North China. The original text is very long, and the content involves using practical methods to denounce the Kuomintang as counter-revolutionary, with the most prominent figures being leftist Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo, etc. Furthermore, there is the May Day Labor Day Announcement from the Pacific Labor Conference. This announcement is not only in China; Japan, India, Taiwan, and the Philippines all have it. The resolution regarding China includes inciting a revolutionary storm, and Section 4 of it even mentions occupying Chinese territory or part of it. Is this kind of action harmful to the Republic of China?" (Niu:) "This document is in Russian. I don't understand it." (Presiding Judge:) "Furthermore, there is the Far Eastern Bureau's resolution from March 18, 1931, a conversation with comrades from March 27, and news about the Seventh Army, etc. Based on the observation of the above-mentioned evidence, whether they are letters received, official documents, or proposals to the Central Party Headquarters, the facts involve how to deploy troops, how to collude with the military, or how to incite workers and peasants. Based on this, it is naturally of a nature that harms the Republic of China. There are still exhibits, some being past events, some being future plans, all of which are important." At this point, the Presiding Judge ordered Niu to step down and summoned Wang Deli Hui. (Presiding Judge:) "Wang Deli Hui, are you Wang Deli Hui? Are you thirty-seven years old this year?" (Wang:) "A month ago, I said I did not want to answer. Today, my attitude remains unchanged." (Wang:) "The court has convened several times, and I have not seen proof that the High Court has jurisdiction. The Shanghai lawyers' association has issued a declaration stating that the High Court has no jurisdiction. I declare that I reserve the right to speak last." (Presiding Judge:) "Who are you? Who is Niu Lan to you? You say Niu Lan is your husband. Do you have a marriage certificate with Niu Lan?" (Presiding Judge:) "I suspect you are not Niu Lan's wife, but a third country sent you to supervise Niu Lan." (Presiding Judge:) "Niu Lan, Wang Deli Hui, it is now twelve o'clock. We will adjourn the questioning for today. We will resume questioning tomorrow at seven o'clock in the morning." (Presiding Judge:) "The record of the hearing on the fifteenth of last month should be read out today." Thereupon, the Clerk of the Court read out the record. The Presiding Judge then announced the adjournment of the court. It was already twelve twenty. On the morning of the eleventh, at eight o'clock, the Jiangsu High Court, in the First Criminal Court of the Jiangning District Court, continued the trial of Niu Lan and his wife for endangering the Republic of China. The judges present were still Presiding Judge Li Mian, Prosecutor Zhu, two judges, one clerk, and defense lawyer Chen Ying. Geneva barrister Feng Jien also attended as an observer. In addition, about twenty representatives from various relevant agencies attended as observers. After the judges took their seats, Niu Lan and his wife were brought to the court. Presiding Judge Li Mian questioned Niu Lan and his wife in turn regarding the circumstances of the questioning and the responses of Niu Lan and his wife, as follows: (Question:) "Niu Lan, there are over seventy pieces of evidence of your crimes seized from the iron box. Yesterday, I only questioned you on a portion of them. You did not answer. You must understand that the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that a judgment can be made even if you do not answer." (Niu replied:) "The defendant has confessions at the Shanghai Police Department and the court, which can be investigated." (Question:) "The police witnesses have already appeared in court once and have provided evidence of your crimes." (Niu replied:) "The police record cannot be used as a basis. According to Article 152 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the evidence must be examined in the presence of the defendant. If not in the presence, there must be three witnesses to prove it. Now, relying solely on the police's unilateral evidence is illegal." (Question:) "When the iron box was searched and sent to the police department for inspection at No. 49 Nanjing Road, you were present. The police have already testified to that." (Niu replied:) "According to Article 155 of the Criminal Procedure Law, when examining evidence, the date, location, and details should be listed clearly to serve as a factual basis. The people present should sign the list so that it is valid. The items considered as evidence in this case should also have a list provided to the defendant for review." (Question:) "There is a list, but you do not answer. Why give it to you for review?" (Niu replied:) "The defendant is not proficient in Chinese. Please translate the list into English for verification." (Question:) "The Chinese court should primarily use Chinese. If there is anything unclear, a translator can be used to convey it." (Niu replied:) "If an English list cannot be provided, it proves that the court does not want to make the evidence public." (Question:) "There are three envelopes in the iron box, containing $823 US dollars and $50 Japanese yen. Were these intended to support the Chinese Red Army?" (Niu did not answer.) (Question:) "The witnesses interrogated on the 15th of this month will prove all your evidence at that time." (Niu replied:) "The police department cannot prove anything in this case." (Question:) "The police department is the agency responsible for executing arrest warrants. All the evidence was seized by the police department. Why can't it be proven?" (Niu replied:) "The Shanghai court agreement does not stipulate that the police department can arbitrarily take away the defendant's belongings without providing a clear list for the defendant to review." (Question:) "What exactly did you do in Shanghai?" (Question:) "You said in the High Court that you were doing business. You didn't answer yesterday. Will you answer today?" (Question:) "We will listen to you even if you don't answer, but we still have to ask." (Question:) "Was the deposit slip for seven banks found at No. 74 West Garden, Yu Yuan Road, yours?" (Niu replied:) "Please present the list for me to see." (Question:) "Is it 4,000 yuan deposited in the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, and 9,000 yuan deposited in the Continental Bank? The deposit in the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank is under the name Xu Weilan." (Niu replied:) "I want to see the list." (Question:) "The list shows 9,000 yuan in the Continental Bank under the name Zhao Cunkai, and 4,000 yuan in the Sze Ming Bank under the name Zhou Jingfu, deposit certificate number 6889, 10,000 yuan in the Bank of China, including 5,000 yuan in Wang Xiaoqin's certificate and 3,000 yuan in Zheng Situi's certificate, 10,000 yuan in the Bank of Communications, deposit certificate number 1579, 7,000 yuan in the China South Bank, originally 9,000 yuan, but 2,000 yuan has been withdrawn by the person himself, and 2,500 yuan in the Day and Night Bank." (Question:) "What is the purpose of depositing money under Chinese names? Is all this money yours?" (Niu replied:) "This was found at No. 74 West Garden, Yu Yuan Road. Please note this in the record." (Question:) "It was found at No. 66 Hart Road. Not No. 74 West Garden. Did you hear clearly? It was found at No. 66 Hart Road." (Niu replied:) "Please note which part of No. 66 the deposit was found in." (Question:) "Is the money yours?" (Niu replied:) "Please provide the search list for No. 66." (Question:) "During the search, you refused to even say your name. How would you sign the list?" (Niu replied:) "Please record that there was no list for the search at No. 66." (Question:) "Another $1,500 US dollars was withdrawn from the Mei Feng Bank by lawyer William on your written instructions. Is this also yours?" (Niu replied:) "Please present the deposit slips from the Bank of China, etc." (Question:) "Just say whether the money is yours or not. Except for the Day and Night Bank, which has ceased operations, the other banks have replied that they have suspended payments." (Niu replied:) "On September 7th last year, the Chinese government published photos of bank deposit slips in newspapers. Now the defendant requests to see the account books, but it is impossible to obtain them. Please take note of this." (Question:) "That is a matter for the administrative authorities." (Question:) "You only need to say whether the money is yours or not." (Niu replied:) "I would like to request the managers of the banks to testify. I have never confronted the bank managers before." (Question:) "What benefit is there to you in requesting the deposit slips?" (Niu replied:) "The defendant has the right to view all kinds of evidence. The court refuses. Please note this in the record." (Question:) "If there is a benefit to you, state the reason, and the deposit slips can be given to you for review." (Niu replied:) "According to Article 284 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the defendant has the right to view them." (Question:) "Article 284 stipulates that the court may allow the defendant to view them, but it does not mean that the defendant can do so freely." (Niu replied:) "The defendant has the right to view the bank deposit certificates." (Question:) "The banks all have replies that can substitute for the deposit slips." (Niu replied:) "Please record that there are no deposit slips." (Question:) "Do you want to see the name and seals? You have more than a dozen aliases." (Niu replied:) "The iron [cabinet] at [Hart Road] No. 66, I request to be sent down for inspection." (Question:) "Your name can be changed at any time. The court believes that</p>
<p>it is not necessary to show it to you." At this point, the judge listed the names Niu had changed. (Niu replied:) "Why could you show me those three boxes yesterday, but you can't show me</p>
<p>the iron cabinet today?" (Question:) "This iron cabinet has not been sent over yet. When it is sent over, it will not matter if you see it or not. Just say if the money is yours or not." (Niu replied:) "Record that this cabinet was taken to the police department." (Question:) "Regarding this point, the witnesses on the 15th will prove it." (Question:) "The US dollars were withdrawn by the lawyer on your written instructions. It is all yours, isn't it?" (Niu replied:) "There are two letters for the withdrawal of money from Mei Feng." (Question:) "Did you write the letters?" (Niu replied:) "Please note a few points: (1) The applications from the Shanghai banks; (2) Mei Feng Bank was summoned for questioning; (3) I was taken to Mei Feng, and Mei Feng acknowledged that I was Heyers; (4) At that time, Mei Feng acknowledged that I, Heyers, lived at No. 66 Hart Road." (Question:) "Zhu Yousong from Mei Feng has testified, and he said it very clearly." (Question:) "You are a teacher. Why do you have eight mailboxes rented at the post office? (1) No. 206; (2) No. 1265; (3) No. 1518; (4) No. 1382; (5) No. 1077; (6) No. 1085; (7) No. 883; (8) No. 1532. What did you rent these mailboxes for?" (Niu replied:) "Now I</p>
<p>request that Mailbox No. 206 and the communist evidence inside be presented for my review." (Question:) "First, we ask if the mailbox is yours." (Niu replied:) "The Supreme Court's investigation has already shown it to me." (Question:) "Even if we bring Mailbox No. 106, you will say it is not yours." (Niu replied:) "Please record that there is only one mailbox, No. 206. There are no others." (Question:) "You are deliberately making trouble. Even if we put all the boxes here, you might still say they are not yours." (Niu replied:) "Please note that the indictment is for Heyers, and the application is for Niu Lan." (Question:) "We will resolve the eight mailboxes one by one. Answer the first one first. Just say if No. 206 is yours or not." (Niu replied:) "There is more to say." (Question:) "First, say if the first mailbox is yours or not." (Niu replied:) "If the court uses coercion, I will not speak." (Question:) "Asking if Mailbox No. 206 is yours, how is that coercion?" (Niu replied:) "The court is violating Article 284 of the Criminal Procedure Law." (Question:) "You are deliberately disrupting things. What is the meaning of this?" (To be continued.)</p>

<p>The Wu Division Arrives in Ji'an and Contacts Various Armies. Nanchang Correspondence: After Zhang Fakui's Fourth Army moved from Guangxi Province to Qingjiang, Zhangshu, Xingan, and Gaoan, it was ordered to be reduced to the Ninetieth Division, with Wu Qiwel serving as the Division Commander and Deputy Army Commander. They were ordered to concentrate in Ji'an from Zhangshu, responsible for attacking the bandit lairs on the east bank of the Gan River. According to news from Ji'an, Wu Qiwel led all his troops to Ji'an and contacted Wei Zhuoying's troops to actively suppress scattered bandits near Ji'an, Jishui, and Taihe. They are preparing to take Futian via Shuinan, Yangtian, and Luojiawei, and then directly attack Donggu to assault Xingguo. At the same time, the troops of Gao Shuxun, Li Kunsong, Xu Kexiang, Mao Bingwen, and Li Yunjie in central and eastern Gan are also actively advancing south. Mao's troops have passed Ganzhu and are only thirty to forty li away from the county seat of Guangchang. Gao's troops have defeated the pseudo-Fourth and Fifth Independent Divisions in Zhongsha, Dongpi, and Luofang, and destroyed the pseudo-Farmers' Association and pseudo-Soviet agencies, as well as the memorial halls of Marx and Lenin. They are preparing to clear the scattered bandits there and then join Mao's troops to attack Huangpi, Xiaopu, and Luokou in Ningdu to recover Ningdu, and then join Wu's troops in Yudu, with the aim of suppressing all bandit lairs in the Gan River area.

<h3 id="e78">Hu Zongnan's Division Returns to Anqing to Await Orders <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Bandit Suppression in Western Anhui Comes to an End. Anqing Correspondence: Hu Zongnan, the commander of the First Division, recently received orders to lead his troops to suppress Red bandits in the counties of Lu'an, Shucheng, Yingshan, and Huoshan, with considerable success. The division has now received orders to return to the province. The vanguard of the Second Brigade, Yuan Pu's troops, arrived in the province a few days ago. Hu continued to arrive in the province on the afternoon of the ninth. The division headquarters is located in the Longmenkou Senior High School. The troops of the First Brigade are also arriving in the province one after another to await orders. According to Hu's account of the bandit suppression, the division went to western Anhui in June and has been suppressing bandits for more than two months. After three general offensives, the bandits retreated to the west of the Piji River. The division learned that the people in Shucheng and Liuhuo have been exploited and oppressed by corrupt local bullies and are in dire straits. Therefore, the division, together with the local county government, severely punished the corrupt local bullies. At the same time, it organized relief work in the disaster areas, so the division received assistance from the people wherever it went. The Liuhuo area is rich in tea and forest resources, exceeding the entire province. Since the blockade of the bandit areas, goods have been unable to be transported out, and resources are worthless. There are countless people nearby who lack food and clothing. After the recovery, the displaced people will gradually gather and will be able to work hard to produce and improve people's livelihoods. I stayed in Sanwanghe Village near Huoshan for a long time. The village's herdboy are very smart and lovely, so I established a special class for herdboy in the people's school established by the division and encouraged them to enroll. (August 11)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Conflict Between the Red Flag Society and the Black Flag Society in Southern Shandong <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Many Casualties on Both Sides</p>
<p>The Garrison Troops Exert Efforts to Suppress the Situation</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Secret societies in southern Shandong have been prevalent. In the early days of organization, villagers joined each other for mutual assistance. Over time, cunning people took advantage of it to build their personal power, and conflicts often occurred due to conflicts of interest. This spring, a dispute arose between the Black Flag Society of Yishui and the district chief, resulting in a major disturbance. The district chief died, and several members of the militia and the society were killed or injured. Fortunately, the Director of Civil Affairs, Li Shuchun, went to Yishui to console the people and restore peace. Just a few months later, the Red Flag Society and the Black Flag Society in Yishui and Ju County clashed again due to minor matters, and the disturbance is becoming increasingly serious. There is a village called Gaojiazhuang in Yishui, which is within the scope of the Red Flag Society, and they have deep animosity towards the Black Flag Society. One day, some Black Flag Society members gathered to gamble in Gaojiazhuang, and were dispersed and insulted by members of the Red Flag Society. The Black Flag Society held a grudge and gathered two thousand members, led by their leader Sun, to attack Dongjiagou ten days ago. Dongjiagou is within the scope of the Red Flag Society, and they were caught off guard. More than eighty people were outnumbered, and either died, were injured, or escaped. Since then, the resentment has deepened, and the Red Flag Society members vowed to retaliate. Therefore, the Black Flag Society members took the initiative and mobilized thousands of members to suddenly attack Mantangpo, the Red Flag Society's base, on July 27 (twenty-five li southeast of Yishui, fifty-five li northwest of Ju County). The Red Flag Society happened to be gathering there for discussions and had prepared early. They immediately opened fire, and the sound of gunfire shook the surrounding area. The Red Flag Society was ultimately outnumbered and unable to break through. However, more than seventy Black Flag Society members were killed or injured while trying to climb the walls at night. The incident occurred near Ju County and Yishui. Therefore, the county heads of both counties, fearing that the disturbance would expand further and lead to a major change, reported to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs, and sent personnel to mediate, urging both sides to stop the attack in order to discuss a settlement. Yishui was originally garrisoned by a regiment of the Yunqi Brigade of the Eighty-first Division. After the incident, they are suppressing the situation there. If the disturbance expands further, more troops may be dispatched. At the same time as the conflict between the Black Flag Society and the Red Flag Society in Yishui, there was also news of a conflict between the Yellow Flag Society members of Zhucheng and the garrison troops. It is reported that a battalion of the Rong Guangxing unit of the Eighty-seventh Brigade of the Twenty-ninth Division is stationed there. A soldier was injured by the Yellow Flag Society members a few days ago. The soldiers were furious and opened fire. Fortunately, local gentry and Battalion Commander Dang intervened and mediated, and the situation has now completely calmed down. (August 8)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Bandits Captured on the Jing-Wu Steamer <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Five Box Cannons Seized</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Small steamers traveling to various places from Wuhu have been robbed an unknown number of times. After the Training Corps of the Central Military Academy was stationed in Wuhu, it dispatched troops to escort the steamers on the Jing-Wu, Hefei, Chaoxian, and Datong routes and strictly inspected the docks in various ports, and the bandits began to restrain themselves somewhat. At the same time, the detective team of the Public Security Bureau and the military police inspection station of the Training Corps also worked hard to investigate and successively solved the robbery cases on the Datong and Jing-Wu steamers, capturing many bandits and firearms. However, yesterday, the Hengfu merchant steamer, which had been robbed not long ago and was traveling between Nanking and Wuhu, was sailing from Jing to Wu. When it reached Dashengguan, thirty li from Jing, it stopped as usual. Two rowboats carried more than twenty passengers to the small steamer. The escorting soldiers conducted inspections according to law. Unexpectedly, six of them, Zhou Lianqing, Pan Chongyi, Tang Ximing, Gong Zhenhui, and Peng Yunsheng, speaking with a Guangxi accent, refused to be inspected, claiming that they had official business to Woyang County to arrest bandits. Zhang Chenghai, the company commander of the Training Corps escorting the steamer, found their movements suspicious and searched them in detail. Four box cannons and one Browning pistol were found on their waists and legs. At that time, the bandits resisted slightly, causing Huang Chuanshou, the platoon leader of the escorting troops, to be injured in the hand. However, due to the bravery of the soldiers, the bandits were successively subdued and escorted to Wuhu, and then transferred to the Training Corps headquarters for interrogation. At that time, a rice merchant on the steamer, named Jia, was carrying four or five thousand yuan in cash. After the bandits were captured, Jia was extremely grateful and offered some money to thank the soldiers of the Training Corps. The team believed that it was their duty to escort the steamer and capture bandits, and declined the offer. (August 9)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Hand Grenade Explosion Injures People in Bangbu <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Six People Injured, Young Girl in Critical Condition. Bangbu Correspondence: On the afternoon of the ninth, at six o'clock, the mortar company of the Sixty-eighth Regiment of Ma Kun's Thirty-fourth Brigade of the Twelfth Division, stationed in Bangbu, hired three carts full of hand grenades to transport them from the Far East Apartment to the opposite side of Tongfeng Sesame Cake Factory on Jing [Road], intending to transport them to Hefei the next day. While passing through the Yixingyong Cloth Store in the third section of Zhongzheng Street in the city, due to the hot weather, the hand grenades on the last cart were shaken and rubbed against each other, and three of them suddenly exploded with three loud bangs. The glass doors and windows of the Yixingyong store were immediately shattered. Pedestrians did not know the truth and fled in panic. The carts were also destroyed in the explosion, and six men and women were injured. After investigation, the injured included rickshaw puller Zhao Xiling, who was injured in the head and feet, and the wife of Xi Xingzhi, the owner of the Yixingyong Cloth Store, Xi Shao, who was holding her one-year-old granddaughter, Xiao Congzi, in her arms, idly looking at the street. Xi Shao was injured in the head, and her granddaughter was injured in three places on her legs, with two toes blown off. She was seriously injured and may die. At that time, a passerby, Shao Liangchen, was injured in the head and feet. Guo Yin, the wife of Guo Dingguo, was passing by and was slightly injured in the leg. Police Officer Wang Qiming was slightly injured in the right leg by a shrapnel shard, but it was not serious. After the incident, the company commander, Tang Qingchang, immediately sent someone to take rickshaw puller Zhao Xiling to the Twelfth Division's military hospital for treatment. The unexploded hand grenades were still sent to Jing [Road]. Xi Shao and her granddaughter were sent to Pingxin Hospital on Damalu by their family members for treatment. Shao Liangchen and Guo Yin were sent to Wenfang Hospital on Ermalu by the police. Zhang Guanru, the director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, dispatched police to investigate the incident within his jurisdiction after the hand grenade explosion and reported it to the headquarters. After receiving the report, You Kaiyun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, sent personnel to visit the injured in various hospitals and reported the truth of the case to Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the garrison headquarters. In the past two months, there have been two other tragic bombing incidents in Bangbu. This is the third time. (August 9)</p>

<p>Old Painter Entices and Rapes Young Girls: Ni Xiaojun, an old pencil painter of sixty-two years, though old in age, commits all kinds of evil. He specializes in enticing poor girls of only ten years and older, committing rape, and then forcing them into prostitution to enrich himself. It is said that he has as many as fifty or sixty "adopted daughters." Moreover, he is skilled in the art of "collecting yin to nourish yang," so although he is old, his spirit is very strong. Gu Zixuan's thirteen-year-old daughter was also enticed, raped, and forced into prostitution. It was reported to the Public Security Bureau, and Ni was arrested. After a preliminary interrogation by the Judicial Section, he was escorted to court for trial yesterday (the 11th) afternoon.</p>
<p>Money Shop Clerk Defrauds Huge Sums: The Jin Feng Money Shop in Tongli Town, Wujiang County, is quite large in scale and has dealings with various money shops in Suzhou, enjoying considerable credit. Wang and Li, the internal and external clerks of the shop, recently stole the shop's seals. Wang came to Suzhou and used written requests to borrow 5,000 yuan in paper money from each of the Fu Da, Bao Da, Feng Tai, Jiu Yuan, and Yi Cheng Yu shops. The Fu Da, Bao Da, Feng Tai, and Jiu Yuan shops did not suspect anything and paid the full amount. However, Yi Cheng Yu did not have such a large amount of paper money at the time, so it was not delivered. A few hours later, someone was sent to deliver it to the Suzhou Tongban Steamboat, but the steamboat had already departed, so it was taken back. The next day (the 10th), Jin Feng Shop sent someone to Suzhou to settle the account with Feng Tai. Gu Xing learned of the previous situation and immediately reported it to the shop via long-distance telephone. Pang Baisheng, the manager of the shop, immediately came to Suzhou by boat to search for Wang and Li, but they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Executive Arrested: The Wu County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has been working hard since the Shanghai Incident, sparing no effort in inspecting Japanese goods. Recently, rumors have been circulating that the association has colluded with unscrupulous merchants to smuggle Japanese goods. The matter came to the attention of the county party headquarters, which sent personnel to take away the association's documents for review. Provincial party headquarters sent Lu Baolin to Suzhou to investigate the case against the county party headquarters and took the opportunity to investigate the Anti-Japanese Association case. He believed that the Anti-Japanese Association was indeed colluding with unscrupulous merchants, so the party headquarters notified the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to arrest Huang Zixin, the executive of the Anti-Japanese Association, who is being temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau pending interrogation. It is said that the association has confiscated Japanese goods worth over 20,000 yuan, which will soon be auctioned off.</p>

<p>Qualified Teachers Strive for Better Treatment: The recently stipulated qualifications for teachers in this county must be re-certified after five years. It is believed that education is constantly changing, and teachers should also evolve with the times to adapt to the environment. However, graduates of normal high schools believe that they have the qualifications of natural teachers and do not need to be re-certified. However, no one can guarantee whether these graduates can evolve with the times and adapt to the environment. Therefore, the Department of Education's regulations are somewhat favorable to graduates and unfavorable to qualified teachers. Therefore, the qualified teachers have requested the Education Association to submit a report to the department to appeal. This was passed by the association's third representative congress and was submitted to the Department of Education for review yesterday.</p>
<p>Borrowing Money to Irrigate Yellowing and Dying Rice: This county has been suffering from a prolonged drought with no rain, and a drought has already formed. Yesterday, someone came to the city from Beiqiao in the west countryside. Along the way, only four mu of rice fields had a little water. The rest were dry and cracked, and some fields had yellowed and died. Farmers do not have enough food to eat, so how can they have the surplus to irrigate? Yuan Fengqi, the district chief of the tenth district, etc., in order to seek irrigation, specially negotiated with the Farmers Bank to borrow 3,000 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, specifically for farmers to irrigate their fields. Each household is limited to 40 yuan, and oil is paid instead of silver. However, only farmers with guaranteed credit have the right to borrow money. Sha Kunquan, a resident of the seventeenth district, also borrowed money from the Farmers Bank on behalf of the farmers to provide irrigation.</p>

<p>Bandit Robbery Causes One Death: Qin Dayou, a farmer from the northern countryside of this county, came to the city for business the other day and returned home in the afternoon. When passing near Mapeng Bay, he suddenly encountered two bandits, each holding firearms, who twisted Qin and searched his body. They only found five silver dollars. At that time, a passerby happened to pass by, and the bandits were quite alarmed, so they opened fire and shot at the passerby. The bullet hit a vital part, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>Issuing County Surtax Promissory Notes: The Nantong County surtax revenue for past years is at 70%. The property management office maintains the status quo and relies solely on saving money. The accumulated deficit has reached more than 170,000 yuan. The local tax revenue for the 20th year is less than 50%, and the shortfall is even greater.

They rushed to report to the county government and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Bails Out Bandit Suspect Detective: Hu Keyin, a detective of the Public Security Detective Team, was previously accused of colluding with bandits by Yang Suxiang, a detective of the same team. He was detained and sent to the county detective team for questioning. Yang, the county magistrate, accepted the request of Wang Jingting, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Dai Jingshan, a standing committee member, and approved the Chamber of Commerce to bail him out. Hu was ordered to return to the team to serve and work hard to redeem himself. He was released on bail at 3 p.m. on the 9th.</p>

<p>Respectfully, regarding the report in the Nantong communications column of your newspaper on August 6th about the Qidong bandit rebellion requesting assistance, this is inconsistent with the facts. Since September of last year, there have been no pirate robberies or Red Bandit disturbances in this county. The dispatch of troops to Qidong was ordered by the Qin Military Commission and the Provincial Security Office, and not because this government requested assistance due to a bandit rebellion. Fearing that the rumors are untrue, we hereby send a special letter of clarification, respectfully requesting that your newspaper publish it in the local communications column to set the record straight.

<h3 id="e94">By Lu Peixuan (1) <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Physical education occupies an important position in education. It is also an essential element for preserving the nation and solving the people's livelihood. Therefore, those who advocate education to save the country and the Three Principles of the People to govern the country must not regard physical education as insignificant. In the past, physical education focused on developing the body and mind, emphasizing health but neglecting the development of individuality. Today's physical education only values competition skills, paying little attention to basic training. As a result, the health of the body and mind and the presence or absence of defects are completely ignored. Society often despises athletes, believing that their character is often crude and their studies are often poor. This is a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Alas, physical education, physical education, all sins can be masked in your name. Is this the fault of physical education? No, it is due to a lack of systematic organization, a lack of good teachers to train physical education, and a lack of understanding of the true meaning and purpose of physical education. Now, the Ministry of Education is convening a national sports conference, bringing together national sports experts and relevant personnel to define a physical education program and solve various problems in physical education. This move is a new record in our country's history. The future of physical education is bright and promising. However, I have some contributions to make: this conference should widely gather talents, and special attention should be paid to children's physical education to lay a foundation. Do not entrust it to those with no experience in elementary school physical education. Therefore, regardless of whether they are experts in large, medium, or small schools, men or women, they should all be convened. The mission of this conference is to preserve the vitality of the nation, assist in the development of the people's livelihood, and promote the development of education. It is not a regular conference that can be perfunctorily handled. Now, I will try to propose seventeen motions below for public discussion, hoping that my comrades will advance and teach them. (1) Popularize the Spirit of Gentleman Athletes: The term "Sportsmanship" has been translated by some as the benevolent and chivalrous spirit in sports. I think it should be simply called "Gentleman Athlete," and loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace should be the necessary conditions for a gentleman athlete. Let me break it down as follows: (A) Loyalty and Filial Piety: Loyalty to the nation, loyalty to the motherland, loyalty to the alma mater, group duties, | fulfilling responsibilities | respecting teachers | mutual assistance.</p>
<p>(B) Benevolence and Love: Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself, | loving the group, loving people, loving yourself, loving things. (C) Trustworthiness and Righteousness: Obeying rules, abiding by conventions, extending to abiding by laws, as well as courage, sacrifice, and obedience. (D) Peace: Physical education without competition has no progress, but competition is a method, not an end. Moreover, if there is no gentlemanly spirit in competition, it is no different from the barbaric touches of wild beasts, not different from being in the ranks of uncivilized people, harming the body and mind, destroying personality, and wasting studies. What is the value of this kind of physical education? Therefore, I must advocate the gentlemanly spirit. The ultimate goal of the Kuomintang is the world commonwealth, and the ideal of physical education is to strive for peace, that is, to compete in the world arena with physique, physical fitness, and physical strength, and gradually expect the physical education of all nations to develop equally in order to maintain peace and abolish all inhumane struggles. This is the highest ideal of physical education. (This article is limited by space and will be discussed in detail later.) According to the development and popularization of foreign physical education, it all depends on this kind of spirit, which is known to almost every household, old and young. Our country urgently needs to popularize it. Starting from senior elementary school, we must start to promote its meaning and practice it at any time. The responsibility should be borne by physical education teachers, and the principal and the personnel of the academic and training departments should inspect and correct it at any time. (2) The National Physical Education Law should be revised as soon as possible. (The National Physical Education Law can be found in the records of the National Education Conference in the 17th year.) This is because the law's content governs the powers of physical education unclearly (there is a reproach of "one monk carries water to drink, two monks carry water to drink, and three monks have no water to drink"), and there are many restrictions and few rewards, which is a loss of the intention to promote it. (3) Zhang Xueliang's proposal for eight physical education programs should be explained and implemented in detail. The plan proposed by Zhang was adopted at the Fourth Plenary Session in the 19th year. The implied meaning is excellent. This conference should formulate implementation methods so as not to lose the reproach of empty words. For example, Article 6 of the original text pays attention to making industrial and commercial circles and civil servants have considerable time to engage in sports outside of their business. How can store managers and factory directors not interfere with the spare time sports of partners and apprentices?</p>

<p>The Conference will Discuss Two Issues</p>
<p>| Emphasize Sports Administration | | Confirm the Status of National Arts | Wu Yunrui Talked in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Yunrui, a member of the preparatory committee for the National Sports Conference and a member of the drafting committee for the National Sports Program, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday for personal matters. Our reporter specially visited Wu and asked him about the various aspects of the National Sports Conference. Wu replied with the following two important points:</p>
<p>Emphasize Sports Administration: This conference will have precise discussions on sports administration in order to urge promotion. Educational institutions from the Ministry of Education to provinces, cities, and counties will establish sports administrators to supervise the implementation of sports in various places at any time in order to achieve practical promotion.</p>
<p>Confirm the Status of National Arts: Recently, the national arts community has been promoting its cause vigorously. At the same time, there seems to be some conflict with the sports community. However, national arts cannot be called the entire sports, nor is it a matter outside the scope of sports. It is only a part of sports. A status will be determined specifically to promote national arts. The above two points are the essential issues for the sports community in our country. It can also be said to be a method of "administering medicine according to the symptoms." Once implemented in the future, it will be a major plan for the revitalization of the sports community in our country. It is said that Wu will leave Shanghai and return to Beijing at 9 a.m. this morning.</p>

<p>Intense Competition Between American, Japanese, and French Swimmers</p>
<p>American Gulub Takes First Place</p>
<p>All Top Six Break Olympic Records (Dentsu, Los Angeles, 10th) The final of today's 100-meter freestyle swimming competition began at 3:30 PM. The three Japanese athletes, Oyakota, Yokoyama, and Sugimoto, departed with an air of determination to win etched on their faces. However, they were ultimately defeated by their strong American and French rivals, finishing in third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively. When Gulub was confirmed in first place and Oyakota in third, the Japanese supporters' section was silent. Only when the three athletes retired did they applaud to console their final efforts. The results are as follows: First: Gulub (USA), 4 minutes 48.4 seconds (New Olympic Record); Second: Darley (France), 4 minutes 48.5 seconds (New Olympic Record);</p>
<p>Third: Tsutomu Oyakota (Japan), 4 minutes 52.3 seconds (New Olympic Record); Fourth: Takashi Yokoyama (Japan), 4 minutes 52.5 seconds (New Olympic Record); Fifth: Sakari Sugimoto (Japan), 4 minutes 56.1 seconds (New Olympic Record); Sixth: Charlton (Australia), 4 minutes 58.9 seconds (New Olympic Record). All six broke the previous Olympic record of 5 minutes 1 second set by Chorila, creating new Olympic records. Today, Japanese expatriates had expected a victory, so the audience was very enthusiastic, but the unexpected defeat was very disappointing. Fortunately, they earned nine points, which is still satisfying. Oyakota, who finished third, was quite thin after his illness and shed tears like rain. When the athletes rested before returning to the pool, he only said "regret, regret." Yokoyama, who finished fourth, told reporters that swimming next to Darley required more effort than he had anticipated. He swam hard throughout but ultimately failed, which was a great regret.</p>
<p>The Course of the 400-Meter Freestyle Final (Dentsu, Los Angeles, 10th) Today’s 400-meter freestyle final, the focus of swimming interest, proceeded as follows: All six started simultaneously, with Darley swimming powerfully and taking the lead, followed by Gulub. Oyakota was in third place, with Sugimoto and Yokoyama slightly behind, swimming shoulder to shoulder. At 50 meters, Darley and Gulub were two meters apart, while Oyakota was already three meters behind, striving to catch up. After Gulub, the order was Charlton, Sugimoto, and Yokoyama, until 100 meters, when Darley was four meters ahead, swimming in the lead. The order remained the same. Upon passing 150 meters, Gulub suddenly surged forward, swimming ahead alone, with Sugimoto and Yokoyama striving to catch up. Charlton lagged behind at the end. At 200 meters, Darley overtook Gulub again. Gulub, four meters behind, chased vigorously, followed by Oyakota, one meter further behind. Sugimoto and Yokoyama were two meters behind. After 250 meters, Darley showed signs of fatigue, and his swimming power greatly decreased. Gulub gradually advanced, striving to close the gap, with Oyakota swimming one meter behind. At 300 meters, Gulub became unstoppable, like a dragon in the water, turning freely. After 350 meters, with only 20 meters to the finish, Gulub caught up with Darley, and they sprinted shoulder to shoulder, initiating a fierce competition. Gulub ultimately reached the finish line first, winning the championship. From first to sixth place, all broke the Olympic record of 5 minutes 1.6 seconds set by Argentine athlete Chorila at the ninth Amsterdam Games in 1928. However, they failed to break Darley's world record of 4 minutes 47 seconds. Nevertheless, Gulub's strength was evident here. Darley also displayed the prestige of a world record holder, and both were worthy of being called famous athletes.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Interest Remains in Swimming <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Los Angeles, 11th) With only three days remaining in the Olympic Games, the focus of interest has been captured by aquatic sports. The overcrowded stands of the past few days have dwindled to three or four thousand people, mostly those with a particular interest in lacrosse and other sports. Therefore, those who maintain the vibrant atmosphere of the grand sports arena since the opening of the games are the participating athletes, sports officials, and journalists. There is still the lacrosse final in track and field, but there is no doubt that India will dominate, as they excel in this sport and have no equal. They will surely bring glory to all of East Asia. In addition, fencing is becoming increasingly exciting, with French, Italian, and German fencers taking the lead. In rowing at Los Angeles Bay and equestrian at Rivarne, Europe had a monopoly until the previous Olympics. This year, Japan and the United States have sent excellent horses to participate, and the outcome is uncertain. The most interesting event of the day will be the men's 1500-meter freestyle preliminary. In the quest for the "King of the Water," the participating Japanese athletes, such as Makino, Kitamura, and Ishizu, claim they will exhibit their best long-distance swimming to avenge the shame of the 400-meter event. The Argentine athlete, to protect his world record created by General Rila from being surpassed, has abandoned the 400-meter event to concentrate all his efforts on the 1500-meter event. When experts encounter each other, a spectacular sight is sure to unfold. The French "Dragon King" Jianli, as well as the first-place finisher of the previous Olympics, Gulub, who set a new world record in the 400-meter event, and Australian Charlton are also not easy opponents. In the 200-meter breaststroke, Japan is the record-holding country and has the best chance of winning. Tsuruta, Koike, and Nakagawa have vowed to participate with the intention of winning, full of spirit. However, Finland's Rhinefall, in addition to Spans, are also formidable opponents. The men's 100-meter backstroke will hold its semi-finals today. With Kiyokawa's record from yesterday, there is also great hope. However, the American Kabasa, etc., are also veterans in this field. The competition for the championship will surely be between the Japanese and American teams.</p>

Therefore, a spring semester class has been added for the first and second years of the senior high general course and the first year of the business course. As the junior high school students are younger and commuting is inconvenient, the school has established a junior high school campus at 55 Kang Nao Road (west end of Gordon Road) in the Public Concession.

<p>79 When Mr. Zhu and Dr. Tang met, there were inevitably some pleasantries, which I have omitted, focusing only on their discussions of questions and difficulties. Dr. Tang first asked Mr. Zhu about my words: (Since your village advocates production, it seems appropriate to use new machines and learn from foreign countries head-on in order to generate great effects. Why do you still use handicrafts?) Mr. Zhu said: (Learning from foreign countries head-on means thoroughly learning the entire process, which is the right way. For example, using Western methods to print books requires learning everything from afforestation to papermaking, to steelmaking, to making printing presses and using large machines to print. If you only learn machine printing, then you will not have steel to make machines, or wood to make paper. As a result, running a printing house or newspaper office will require buying foreign machines and foreign paper. Therefore, printing houses and newspaper offices become large-scale sales organizations for foreign paper, and even their own lives are controlled by foreign paper merchants. Learning from foreign countries head-on means first learning how to afforest, make paper, make steel, and make machines, and then learning how to use large machines for printing. Before learning how to make paper, make steel, and make machines, jumping directly to learning how to use large machines for printing is extremely dangerous. So, in my opinion, there is an order to learning from foreign countries head-on, and if this order is reversed, instability in the industrial world will occur. One of the production activities advocated in our village is everything from planting cotton to tailoring. The planting of cotton adopts the latest scientific methods, while spinning, weaving, and tailoring are still done by hand. However, in handicrafts, we also strive to improve technology.) Dr. Tang said: (How can cloth woven by hand compete with products made by machines?) Mr. Zhu said: (How does the competition between automobiles and sedan chairs fare?) Dr. Tang said: (Of course, automobiles win and sedan chairs lose. Shanghai has not had a single sedan chair since 1929.) Mr. Zhu said: (Shanghai does not have a single sedan chair, but it has many handcarts. Automobiles can drive away sedan chairs, but they cannot drive away handcarts. What is the reason for this? People who used to ride in sedan chairs have switched to riding in automobiles, so automobiles are suitable for survival, and sedan chairs are naturally eliminated. People who ride in handcarts can still only afford to ride in handcarts and cannot afford to ride in automobiles, so handcarts are still suitable for survival, and although automobiles are fierce, they cannot defeat handcarts. Machines can only defeat some handicrafts, and some are not easily defeated. Is that right?)</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The short fellow of jokes and anecdotes has put forward a puppet-like Manchu state. People in society feel that the commonly used Manchu proverbs are very mysterious and want to explore the door to this mystery. According to their views, there are the following interpretations: "Sweating profusely." | This sentence should be applied to Puyi. His going to be the puppet head of Manchuria is "sweating profusely." "Da Khan" means great Khan, which means that he has not awakened from his imperial dream. "Manchu rice is good to eat, Manchu language is difficult to speak." | The short fellow forcefully points out that the people outside the customs are Manchus, which is extremely ridiculous. Manchus have already assimilated with the Chinese. Most of the people in the Northeast are from Hebei and Shandong. They live in Manchuria, but they can only eat Manchu rice and cannot speak the Manchu language. It really calls for "Manchu rice is good to eat, Manchu language is difficult to speak." "One wrong move leads to a complete loss." | These two sentences should of course be applied to the non-resistant Northeast authorities: one wrong move has led to the loss of the entire Manchurian territory. "A full load of sesame seeds is spilled, scraping from the sugar cake." | These two sentences should also be applied to the Northeast authorities: he lost all of Manchuria, which is like spilling a full load of sesame seeds; but he wants to scrape sesame seeds from the sugar cake to compensate for his losses. One telegram in the morning asks for tens of thousands, and one telegram in the evening asks for tens of thousands. These are like sesame seeds on the sugar cake, and even if they are scraped clean, they cannot make up for the spilled full load of sesame seeds. If you want sesame seeds, you should go out of the customs and take a trip.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Yang the Beggar's Road Building Story <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Yang San. A native of northern Sichuan. Ten years ago, due to difficult living conditions, he became a beggar. He wandered to Yongxing Court in southern Sichuan, begging from door to door, sleeping in the open air, and spending his life as a beggar. He felt that the roads were rugged and narrow, which caused many inconveniences for merchants and travelers. So, he carried a hoe and shovel to make them flat. Over time, he became familiar with the local people and the land, and various circles in the local area helped him slightly. Yang took the opportunity to solicit donations and hire workers to repair the roads. With twenty yuan, he repaired a section of road worth twenty yuan. With ten yuan, he repaired a section of road worth ten yuan. Whether it was sunny or rainy, he supervised the work by the side of the road and also participated in the operation. In tattered clothes and worn-out shoes, his hands and feet were calloused. He never took any money from the donations for his own food and clothing, and he still went out to beg for food. He was clear about public and private matters and never took a penny dishonestly. Therefore, people far and near respected him. When they heard that he was coming, they often helped him generously. Even young children and old people with white hair called him Yang the Benevolent. His transformative power was such that for several years, rich merchants and gentry from Zigong knew that he was honest and impartial, did good deeds widely, and benefited travelers. They all donated money to help. Whenever Yang went to someone's house, he had a smiling face. Before he could open his mouth, they were often generous and happy to help without hesitation. In the past ten years, he has built more than three hundred li of trunk roads. The number of branch roads is countless, from Xufu Diao Huanglou, Zongchang Datieya, Yongxingchang Baihuachang Wubao Town to Zigong Liangjing and other places. They have all become flat and prosperous. Travelers say it is convenient. The road from Zigong to Yibin was originally paved with stone slabs. Thirty years ago, it was repaired by Li Heng. Over time, it became dilapidated. Fortunately, Yang the Benevolent raised funds to repair it, and the road became flat. Yang became ill due to overwork and lay in bed at Guan Yu Temple in Yongxingchang. He died of illness. He Runmin, the head of Baihua Town, felt sorry for his tragic experience and admired his behavior. In addition to donating clothes and coffins, he also launched a memorial service for him. Alas. Building bridges and repairing roads accumulates blessings in heaven. Although Yang the Benevolent was a beggar, he was able to benefit others as his responsibility. Although his physical body has died, his name will be forever known. This is a record of it.</p>

<p>— ·Old Man Rice-Eating and Ox-Herding</p>
<p>Yang Liaogong's Tavern Wall Inscription by Yang Liaogong, a famous scholar from Huating. His temperament was unrestrained, like that of a Jin Dynasty person. He viewed money as dirt and loved friends more than his own flesh and blood. In the seventh month of the Dingmao year, he died of illness in a Shanghai apartment building. When the news spread, all those who had acquaintance with him rushed to his bier, taking one last look at his face in death, wiping away tears. During winter, Liaogong usually stayed at home in his old house inside the city, near Qin Bridge. To the east of the bridge was a small market where a man named Li sold wine. The owner, orphaned at a young age like Li Mi, was raised by his grandmother. The grandmother was skilled at cooking, especially her oil-fried chicken, which tasted better than that of others. Even those who tried to imitate her secretly could not match her. Therefore, after the Double Ninth Festival, her door was filled with customers every day. If one was late, the chicken was sold out. One had to order the night before to get it. Such was the prosperity of her business, and one can imagine how skillful her cooking was. Every year when winter came, Liaogong almost never missed a day to call his friends to Li's tavern, killing a chicken to enjoy with drinks. On the birthday of Jiazi Furong, he sent a letter inviting me and Xi Yanzi to Songjiang to enjoy the delicious taste of Benyou'er. An empty stomach and wine, with a feeling of sharp insight suddenly appeared. He grabbed a brush and ink and wrote a verse on the powdered wall, "Old age, youthful pursuits; tender chicken, red friend's life." From then on, Li's chicken and wine entered the county gazetteer, alongside the Song Sister of West Lake. Fields, property, gold, silver, antiques. Make you unable to return to your hometown, unable to see your parents in the afterlife. What will you do? (B) I'm determined to fight him to the death. (A) Suppose your (double enemy) actually comes to your door, wanting to eradicate you completely. What will you do? (B) I'm determined to fight him to the death. (A) Suppose your (double enemy) is extremely fierce and could kill you with one casual punch. What will you do? (B) I've already put life and death out of my mind. I'm determined to fight him to the death. (A) Can you use your fists, feet, teeth, and your enemy to fight to the death and die together? (B) Hmm... I think dying in vain is useless... I'm determined to borrow money from my protector, Uncle Wang, to buy a handgun and shoot him to death. (A) Suppose Uncle Wang is so poor that he's pawned everything and has no money for you. What will you do? (B) That's no child's play. What am I going to rely on to resist my enemy? (A) Suppose someone sees you not avenging your father and scolds you for being unfilial. What will you do? (B) That won't do. Uncle Wang has to take responsibility for this. (A) What are you saying? (B) Why doesn't he give me money? (A) Bah! You keep yelling (fight to the death), keep saying (putting life and death out of your mind). You don't go and actually fight to the death, but reach out to Uncle Wang for money. What do you want money for? (B) Alas... Alas, fighting to the death is just a pretense. I'm just saying it. Don't be angry, old man. Haha... Haha...</p>
<h3 id="e123">On Lotus Root <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wanhua</p>
<p>Among the red flower lotus roots, it is a cool and refreshing world to escape the summer heat, and the beautiful woman's snow-white lotus root is especially a wonderful product to wash away the heat and soothe the spleen. In the past, when I was a guest in Green Willow City, to pass the hot summer, I would always punt a boat on the slender West Lake. Choosing a deep place in the lotus shade, I placed myself in the midst of ten thousand greens. At times, a refreshing breeze would greet me, and a delicate fragrance would enter my sleeves. Opening my shirt to the wind, it was a different world. I would then buy freshly picked tender lotus roots from the misty waves, slice them, and eat them. The coolness would penetrate my teeth and cheeks, enough to relieve the thirst of the literary garden. Looking at the scenery and feeling emotions, I would vaguely see a lotus arm half-bent, from last night's sweet pillow. Chewing on this, there was even more aftertaste.</p>
<p>The relationship between lotus root and emotional people has been widely praised by poets. This is because it emerges from the filthy mud without being stained, maintaining its sacred purity. It is just like emotional people using noble love and pure integrity to break through dark and difficult environments and stand in the same position. To the exquisite heart, it is good at spitting out affectionate silk. Even if the body is divided, the silk is still connected. As for emotional people, ("spring silkworm until death the silk ceases,") ("the heart has a spiritual rhinoceros a little penetrates"). They also have the same sympathy for each other. This is why lotus root is valued by emotional people and prepared as the only food during intimate moments.</p>
<p>Lotus root is of great benefit to health. Those sold in cities, either because they have been out of the water for a long time or because of climate changes, it seems more difficult to find those with complete color, fragrance, and taste. Those who eat it should store it in a hanging container and immerse it in a deep well, which can preserve much of the original flavor. Lotus roots in the shape of linked branches are wonderful gifts for lovers, no less than a knot of unity and a jade ring. However, they are not easy to obtain. There are also descendants lotus roots, with small branches clustered on the giant stalk, like arhats. Lovers often offer them on the banquet table during the Qixi Festival to worship the Cowherd and Weaver Girl and during the Mid-Autumn Festival to worship the moon, in order to pray for children and blessings.</p>
<p>West Lake lotus root, along with the lake scenery, has been praised. Its lotus root powder, when eaten, is mixed with rock sugar and boiling water. At noon, it is used instead of tea, which can clear the lungs and intestines, aid digestion, and dispel heat and remove烦恼. It is truly a supreme drink. Or, glutinous rice is stuffed into the lotus root holes, cooked, sliced, and sprinkled with sugar. In addition, the soup left over from cooking the lotus root is used to cook fragrant rice into porridge. Sipping lotus root porridge with lotus root dishes is fragrant, sweet, and palatable, penetrating the heart and spleen. This is also a new innovation, which can supplement what the food book does not cover.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Random Talk on Goldfish <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Not being able to wake up early in the morning is also very related to the body. Therefore, I use raising goldfish to remind myself. I know that in everyone's mind, it often happens like this. When you admire something, you will be entangled and worried about it all the time. Therefore, my morning goldfish watching has become a daily routine.</p>
<p>I remember one morning, when I was leaning over to look at the small fish in the tank, I felt that the small fish had a particularly large appetite. I gave them a lot of red worms, and they were all eaten up in less than a quarter of an hour. The development of small fish is also divided into fast and slow. Those hatched in the same period differ greatly in size in less than a week. A few of the larger ones couldn't find food to eat, and their little bellies were not full. Therefore, they would even indiscriminately harm the smaller ones of their kind. The smaller ones couldn't swim fast and couldn't avoid it, so they had to let it be slaughtered, let it be swallowed whole. The innocent little fish had their tails and eyes eaten up. Looking at them, only some游气 was left. Those few fierce ones still didn't let them live. They went further and further, eating their intestines, heart, liver, and bone fragments, leaving nothing behind. Only then did they triumphantly go to chase other fish. I couldn't stand it, so I caught those few strong and domineering ones and separated them, so there was no tragedy of fish cannibalizing each other.</p>
<p>Later, when I thought about it, fish are ignorant and unconscious aquatic animals, yet their nature allows them to kill each other. No wonder humans do the same. Originally, no matter if it's a group, an assembly, a town, or even a province, a country, or the whole world, what justice is there to talk about? Isn't it the same as fish, where the strong bully the weak? Fish do it because they have no food to eat. As for people, the scope is too broad. But when you think about it carefully, it's all for the problem of food, clothing, and shelter. It's a pity that there aren't people like the goldfish watcher to mediate for them one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Records of Things Seen and Heard in the Old Capital <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Seal Paste Recently, there is a Wu Disheng who claims to have obtained the method of making seal paste from Mr. Li of the Imperial Household Department of the Forbidden City. Using the secrets not passed down within the inner court, he makes seal paste and sells it at a very high price. He also wrote a book detailing the method. Introduced by a friend, I spent ten yuan to get one tael, which was still cheap. His products are deep red and vibrant, the same in winter and summer, which is truly his specialty. According to his description, selecting materials is the priority in making paste, and choosing oil is the most urgent. The oil must be aged, and it must be naturally aged, not artificially. He claims to have obtained a bottle of oil from a certain residence, which was yellow, a thing from the Qianlong period, with the number and weight of the Imperial Household Department. With this precious oil, he used moxa floss and willow catkins as the base, used high-quality cinnabar as the color, and added gems and gold leaf to assist it. After it is made, it must be buried three feet deep in the soil for half a year before being used. He also said that he planned to continue making seal paste with red gold, coral, male essence, lapis lazuli, turquoise, malachite, and crystal. He expects himself to be a revolution in seal paste. There are many eccentric people in the old capital. Even the slightest interest has those who study it all their lives. I record this to broaden the strange news.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Fayuan Temple <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Many temples in the northern capital possess good fields and beautiful products. They have good connections and live in wealth. They are proud of this. This is all a habit formed by emperors, eunuchs, nobles, and relatives who flatter the Buddha. When there is a lot of property, there is always competition. The pure realm is turned into a den of fame and fortune. In recent years, the Fayuan Temple in the south of the city is the one with temple property that has triggered disputes. The temple was where Emperor Taizong of Tang Dynasty prayed for the soldiers who conquered the East, so it is called Minzhong. Xie Fangde was also imprisoned in this temple when he was arrested and brought to Yan. It is truly the oldest stupa in Beijing. The inscriptions on the tablets of other temples cannot surpass the Yuan Dynasty. However, this place alone has a Tang Dynasty tablet. Moreover, the courtyards are quiet and peaceful, the flowers and trees are lush, and famous people have left inscriptions, calligraphy, paintings, and literary playthings, which are the best in the capital. Literary men and poets have always enjoyed praising it. Today, the temple is still famous for its lilacs. When they bloom, the purple color is like a steaming glow, and the fragrance touches the sleeves. The essence of blue is the best, and it is finally called the head. However, the prosperity of a hundred years ago is not comparable to today. The Beijing Miscellaneous Records says. (On the eighth day of the fourth month of the year, the Minzhong Temple in the southern city holds a life release conference. Wealthy merchants, women, and wives of prominent officials wear elaborate makeup and beautiful clothes, and gather like bees. Frivolous teenagers act like they are visiting a brothel. Cars hit the grain and people rub shoulders. The monks guarding the door ask for 200 coins from those who enter, otherwise they are refused. Thus, green and red are marked, and shoes are intertwined. Pearls are lost and emeralds fall, and powder and grease flow. The monasteries seem like the Zhen and Wei rivers. The monks also give each child brought by the women a piggy bank, enticing them to bring it back full and send it to the meeting next year. Thus, the gold earned in one day amounts to thousands. Those who say that it is a life release conference only buy a few sparrows and release them. In reality, there is nothing to see. Later, a certain censor presented a memorial to ban it, and it was abolished.) In recent years, the prosperity of Buddhist affairs is not in Fayuan, but in Guangji. This is also an old temple from the Jin Dynasty. It has been in disrepair for a long time. In the early years of the Republic of China, the powerful people in power raised money to rebuild it, and it became a garden of gold. Guests with swords and shoes, and the faces of powder and dai, come together in droves. The secular dust is tangible. The bad habits of hundreds of years still remain in this tail sound. I am afraid that it will not be long before it will be like the Fayuan Temple, only for passers-by to mourn.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Terrifying Fall in Finance and Gold Market <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A Wild Drop of Fifteen Taels and Four Mace</p>
<p>Total Drop of Over Thirty-Three Taels in Three Days The gold standard capital drop is intensifying, infinitely changing, with shocking waves that cannot be suppressed. At every turn, the price swings three or four taels high or low. The entire day has ten taels of price swings. Industry intentions are confused and payment is unstable, leading to an extremely chaotic market situation. The final wild drop was greater than fifteen taels. Silver prices, contrary to yesterday's expectation of reduction, rose. This was especially due to the frequent buying in the US for forward silver. This caused the gold price to immediately drop by more than ten taels, breaking through 720 taels. The selling wind in the market grew even stronger, almost due to the extreme looseness of foreign exchange. However, short sellers seized this opportunity to make some gains. The exchange rates of the UK and US both seem to have recovered. Even though fellow traders were selling heavily, bank appetite remained unceasing. This led to a recovery of more than seven taels. At noon, the softening reappeared. The later market went from stable to weak, truly due to the selling party exceeding the Heng standard. Further, exchange rates were especially loose. Panic reigned in the market, causing a sudden drop of six or seven taels. It finally broke 710 taels. In the end, there was a slight recovery of three to five taels, hovering around twelve or thirteen taels. The tumbling trend has no certainty. The details of the entire day are recorded below.</p>
<p>Open at wild drop of twelve taels and seven mace The market opened in the morning for September contracts with a wild drop of twelve taels and seven mace, to 715 and a half taels. The "Big Bar" rose another one-sixteenth. The silver price rose one-eighth. Private telegrams actually rose seven-eighths. Due to exchange rates repeatedly rising, it also affected it. Bingxing and Ruixing were the first to sell, followed by five taels and two mace. Then, it recovered more than two taels, bought by Hengxing, Yuan Hengchang, Yong Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongyuan, Taiyuan, Heng, etc. The initial opening for US dollars was very strong. August could be settled at 30.9375 yuan. November was sold to the bank at 31.375 yuan, then 31.25 yuan. Thus, the gold price rose to 18 taels. Unfortunately, the Hua Bi suddenly came out with November 375. Mai Hang offered September 1875. Fuxing, Yongyuan Hengyu, Futai Heng, Bingxing, Hengxing, Hengxing Yuan, etc. sold one after another. By 9:20 AM, it was only 11 taels and one mace. However, there were still one tael gains and losses from time to time. HSBC offered November UK gold at 19375 and bought December US dollars at 6875. By 9:30 AM, the quoted price for UK gold was hanging long at 125 and the US dollar at 375. However, the gold price was unmoved, because Hengxing, Yifeng, Yong, etc. came back to buy. At that time, it was around 13 taels. Later, Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu Zhaofengchang, Hengxing Yuan, etc. did not give up their intention to buy. At 9:45 AM, it was 17 and a half taels, then suddenly reduced to 15 taels and two mace. Bingxing still sold non-stop. At 10:00 AM, the bank absorbed September at 31 yuan. December was 5625. Then, a silver company bought October UK gold at 375. In the market, Hengyu Zhifeng, Yong Fuyu, Daxingyong, Tong Taichang, Hengxing Yuan, Xie Xingyong, Chang Yifeng Yong all entered. Hengxing covered the short positions, so the market price went straight ahead. After 10:30 AM, it was 18 taels and eight mace. Mai Hang absorbed December 31.375 yuan, and Yifeng Hengxing Yuan Ruixing Hongkang Yongyuan Maoyong, etc. sold, losing three taels, for 15 taels and six mace. Soon, it increased by three taels, and Shunli, Yuantai, Hongkang Yong and other households came to buy. November US dollars were still selling at 25. At 11:00 AM, it was 18 taels and six mace. Afterwards, December US dollars were 4375 to half a yuan, so the gold price fell again. Zhaofengchang Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu Fuyu, Hengxing Yuan, etc. all had sales, so it turned weak. At 11:50 AM, it was 13 taels and five mace. The noon closing was 15 taels and one mace.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Continues to Decline The afternoon market opened at 14 taels and seven mace, then 12 taels and two mace. Dede Chengheng Maoyong Shenkang, etc. bought. However, Bingxing was the first to sell. A new household on the surface absorbed it, so the price was raised. In November, HSBC absorbed over 3025 for the US dollar. Later, September was trading at 25. December had to be sold at 6875 to 75. The market situation weakened again. Bingxing Zhifeng Yong, Zhaofengchang, Hengxing Yuan, Yifeng Yong, etc. sold again and again, so the price could not be supported and fell six or seven taels, breaking through 710 taels. At 2:50 PM, the new low price was 09 taels. Soon after, Mitsui absorbed 625 for December. Zhifeng Yong, Zhaofengchang Yifeng Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Yuan Maoyong, etc. bought back, causing the price to jump four or five taels. At 3:15 PM, it was 13 taels and eight mace. Later, Daxingyong, etc. sold, only accounting for 11 taels. Afterwards, it seemed peaceful. The US dollar at 31 and a half yuan in November could still be absorbed by the bank. In addition, some retail short positions made gains, so it was 13 taels. The closing price at 4:00 PM was 12 taels and eight mace, a wild drop of 15 taels and four mace compared to the previous noon. It has fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 33 taels, which is huge. After the market closed, it was raised to three and a half taels, then within three taels. In general, the unstable minds and the division of payments. According to the maximum of 18 taels and eight mace and the minimum of 09 taels in one day, there are nine taels and eight mace of gains and losses. The bare rate is calculated to add 10 taels and five mace.</p>
<p>Posted prices are mostly repressed five or six taels. The quoted price was changed to 783 taels. With the US dollar quoted at a large 375, the calculation presses 70 taels to 64 or 5 taels. In the afternoon, it was 67 or 8 taels to 73 or 4 taels. In the end, it was about 70 taels, pressing five or six taels more than the previous noon. The ledger was 15 taels and the water supplement was 15 taels to 13 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions are Extremely Complicated While the trading is quite strong, the supply and demand are chaotic. In total, Hengxing and Taichang each entered over 1,000 bars (covering short positions). They sold 600 to 700 bars. Shunli, Xiexing Yong, Yuantai, Yifeng Yong, and Yuan Kangxiang all entered. Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, Futai Heng, Ruixing, and Daxingyong all rolled out. Fuxing Yong, Bingxing, Hongkang Yong, Tongfeng Heng, Yifeng, and Zhifeng Yong all exited. Yuan Maoyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Hengxing Yuan, Yuan Heng, and Dede Cheng traded very closely with uneven entries and exits.

Daxingyong, Zhifeng Yong, Zhaofengchang, and Hengxing Yuan exited and then entered. The rest were mostly complicated. Hedging entered.</p>

<p>The unregulated spot market... the US dollar has a particularly severe decline... The trading is extremely strong... the bank appetite is still good... the swap is further and further away.</p>
<p>Yesterday the silver market was slightly higher. Exchange rates have been rising for three days. The local foreign exchange is particularly loose and unregulated. UK gold is hanging long at 125, calculated at one shilling and nine pence. The US dollar is at 375, calculated at 30 yuan and 625. The French franc is plus 25, calculated at 76 and a half taels. Other exchange rates have consistently increased. As for the domestic market, it was quite chaotic throughout the day. It was loose at first, then flat, and the afternoon was especially strained. The US dollar was particularly declining, because the exchange rate was greatly tightened. The closing price was higher than the previous noon. UK gold increased 1875 and the US dollar increased 6875, which led to a terrible drop of more than 10 taels in the gold market, which broke through 710 taels.

<p>Yesterday the market price of silver cents remained weak, with the early market at six qian, eight fen, seven li, seven hao, and half. The afternoon market was six qian, eight fen, seven li, six hao, and two thousandths of a si and a half. As a result, it was only one hao and two thousandths of a si and a half lower than the previous day's afternoon market, but the weakness of the situation is probably not reliable. The silver discount in the early and afternoon markets remained the same as the previous day, only accounting for six fen. There were many lined holes, so the drawn head had no added water and was done in white. The drawn exchange ticket was 365,000 in the early market and 525,000 in the afternoon market. The banknote was 40,000 in the early market and 30,000 in the afternoon market. The over-the-counter banknote was 70,000 in the early market and 55,000 in the afternoon market.

The auxiliary currency market, the small Jiangnan ocean, was six qian, zero li, half a cent in the early market. Due to the small amount of transactions in the afternoon market, the market price did not move. The transaction was 3,500 jiao in the early market and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The small Guangdong ocean was five qian, eight fen, and two li in the early market and five qian, eight fen, and two and a half li in the afternoon market.

<p>The Trend is Stagnant, the Market is Still Clear</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading situation on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the entry and exit of spot goods continued to be extremely rare. Only 5,000 yuan of 20 Customs Bonds were sold. The others remained without a market. The futures trading was even more scarce than before. All parties only had small amounts of buying and selling. The September contracts also remained without trading. Only 1.675 million yuan of August contracts were traded. Internal troop reduction and salt tax were each about 380,000. Unified tax was 280,000. The others averaged about 100,000 yuan. The Customs Bond 96 was exactly six, only several tens of thousands of yuan. As for the situation of the various bonds, although the market was deserted and the trading was scarce, the opening price in the early morning was unanimously six or seven jiao higher than the previous day. Looking at the situation of the bond market, the current return to firmness is due to the stable environment. The political situation is expected not to have major changes. The international situation is slightly better, and there is a slight replenishment in the market. However, speaking of its future, it is not permissible to be overly optimistic. It will still shift with the diplomatic situation.</p>

<p>(Report from American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>The New York stock market continued to rise on Wednesday. AT&amp;T stock rose by four points, Auburn Automobile rose by 3.25 points, Chrysler rose by three points, and utilities rose by 2.5 points. Due to the continued rise in wheat prices, (American agricultural implement) stocks also surged by 4.5 points, reaching 31 dollars, the highest record of the year. However, Kodak shares plummeted by 7.5 dollars as its dividend was reduced from five dollars to three dollars. Trading was brisk throughout the day, with 4.4 million shares changing hands. The recent optimism in Wall Street is attributed to the gradual recovery of bond prices and the gradual increase in commodity prices. The progress of American cotton and large yarns has a significant impact on the stock market. According to the opinion of the Batchayas Company, after President Hoover accepts the presidential nomination speech tonight (i.e., last night), it may be the time when the stock market reaches its highest point, as general traders tend to take a weather-vane principle and take the opportunity to close out positions when the election campaign is at its hottest. The Dow Jones Index for Wednesday is attached below:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market is slightly weak, and the market is unusually active, changing several times a day. Due to the fall in gold prices and the loosening of raw cotton, people's sentiment is slightly soft. Although there is no smooth progress in the demand from customer groups, sporadic transactions are still uninterrupted, so the buyer's sentiment is still strong, but Rongxing bulls have slightly closed out positions.</p>
<p>Human Standard Drops Six, Seven, Eight Cents. The opening of the Human Standard forward market was driven by the rise in American cotton, and people's sentiment was firm the next day, continuing to rise. Each month rose by 5 or 6 cents, but then fell back in the second and third sessions. As a result, each month fell by 4, 7, or 8 cents. The market fell again at the afternoon opening, but rebounded in the second and third sessions. The closing was soft again. As a result, each month was similar to the morning session. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 37,000 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 1,000 bales, Tongxing 1,350 bales, Yida 650 bales, Xingyuan 600 bales, Yongda 700 bales, Jifeng 750 bales, and Ruidai 650 bales.

<p>The cotton market is slightly weak. American cotton continues to move upward. The gold market is trending down, and exchange rates are loose, resulting in a hidden decline in prices. The foreign cotton calculation in silver is not much up or down, so some buyers have turned from long to short, and the market is slightly soft, but the buyer's attitude is still strong.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Slightly Decreases. The opening of the Zheng Standard morning market was driven by the continued high prices of American cotton, but the gold market fell sharply, and the market prices contradicted each other. The opening was still firm, but fell back in the second and third sessions. As a result, each month fell by 5 cents to 2 or 3 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the weather was dark and there were signs of rain. The market fell again, but rebounded in the second and third sessions. The closing was heard that the gold market was lower again, and it fell again. As a result, each month fell again by 5 cents to 1 cent. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 121,700 dan. It was found that Suijiang sold 4,600 dan, Jifeng 4,100 dan, Rongxing 7,700 dan, Ruidai 3,100 dan, Yuandai 3,800 dan, and Xiesheng 3,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices rose because of mass purchases, poor harvest conditions, and a good cloth market. The market was firm and lively. Futures rose by 17 to 19 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 or 7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged.

<p>South Shanghai Yesterday, more than a dozen boats came from various groups, and there was not much accumulation in the Pujiang River. The sales in urban and rural shops are becoming increasingly sluggish. The reason is that the silver market is very tight, and customers are loosening their grip at any time. Early thin rice, new japonica rice, and thick japonica rice are all short by about 2 jiao. The rest are showing a downward trend. The total amount of rice sold throughout the day was about 1,000 shi.</p>
<p>North Shanghai Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived along the Suzhou River. The sales market in this street is extremely weak. At the opening in the morning, thin rice and new customer tips fell by 3 chi. Changxi Beigeng villages have some social interactions, and they are tired and close to the corner. Glutinous rice and early rice have small arrivals and sales, and the market is also tired every day. Foreign Dujian is short of goods, and the shape returns to flatness.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Foreign Rice Sales Stagnant, Softening by Five Cents <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of foreign rice turned stagnant, and the total market only had more than a thousand bags of transactions. The stomach in this street is even more stagnant, and customers are also watching. Because the export of Xiang rice has been decided, and a small number have been loaded. The appearance of Shanghai has been seen, and it will arrive soon, but the combined price is high. It is difficult to predict whether it can be planned after the first batch arrives. However, people's hearts have softened, and foreign rice has immediately returned to a small five or six cents. It is estimated that 500 bags of Saigon rice were handled from Nanjing, priced at 10 yuan and 4 jiao to 2 jiao. Chongming went to Xiaojiao 500 bags, and this street also went to 300 bags, priced at 9 yuan and 7 jiao to 5 jiao and a half. Also, 50 bags of red rice, priced at 8 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Standard Flour Rises and Then Falls Again <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, showed a trend of initial rise and then fall in each month. When the price was opened, because the quoted price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 4 or 5 jiao, the opening price was raised by one cent more than the previous day. However, it tended to fall in the second session, because Fuxin, Fufeng, Xinda and other factories smoothly sold out about 200,000. Moreover, the gold market fell sharply, and the exchange rate increased greatly. The activity of foreign wheat was also very exciting. It was rumored that the factory had ordered another ship, priced at only 4 taels and 5 fen. The decline in people's hearts is not without reason. As a result, each month from this month to October fell by 7.5 li, November fell by 1 cent and 2.5 li, and December and January fell by 1 cent.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Futures Wheat Has No Major Ups and Downs <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month generally showed a stable trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat rebounded by 4 or 5 jiao, but the increase in the exchange rate appropriately leveled it off. Moreover, it is easier to approach for ordering, so although people's hearts are stable, it is not easy to raise prices. However, in the near future, because the domestic environment is very good, it is difficult to look down on it. If foreign wheat is traded, there will be a conflict with the long-term. In the near future, domestic wheat must be delivered. As a result, this month was larger by one cent than the previous day, September was smaller by one cent, and the remaining months had no ups and downs. Since the arrivals and sales of current wheat are all quiet, only the bags have not been opened.</p>

<p>The New York silk weaving industry, in view of the fact that the cocoon production in various silk-producing countries in the world this year has been unusually poor, the raw silk raw materials are scarce, and the production is not enough for sales, so they have all started to hoard. Since Monday, the silk in the market has been competing to buy, almost emptying it. Silk prices have risen sharply.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the US sales of yellow and white factory silk, the market has suddenly become popular. In addition, after the news of the sharp rise in Yokohama Nissin silk was confirmed, the market sentiment became more firm. Yesterday, Dachang, Xinfu, Yihua and others entered 90 packages of Jinshuangying, Yuetu, Swimming, and Dancing brand 13-15 tael white factory silk, priced at 560 taels to 80 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, British and American companies did not spare any effort to search for green tea such as Luxiang Tuzhuang's zhenmei, zhenmei, and dabang teas. Transactions were very active. Zhenmei, xiumei, pearl tea and various Luxiang core-drawing goods were all firm and rising in the market. Tongfu Baochang and other firms also planned to move on the Wubei Gongse Zhenmei yesterday. However, because the Chinese merchants' attitude was firm, the negotiations have not been properly resolved. As for the red tea market, it is still quiet. The British market is full of Indian tea, so no one asks about the medium and low Zhuang goods.</p>

<p>The number of new Hainan round meat that arrived a few days ago was more than before. Each firm believes that this year is a bumper harvest, and the sales are not yet prosperous. In the future, the supply will inevitably exceed the demand. Therefore, the prices of this batch are all cautious and wait and see. Yesterday, the dishes began to be made. The North and South family have already opened, and the previous dishes have dropped by about 8 taels. Today's bank dishes will inevitably fall accordingly.</p>

However, there were fixed-order transactions on the foreign firm side yesterday. It was found that 90-pound single-linked and 90-pound double-linked British Mabukou iron were set to exit 3,500 boxes yesterday. It was found that the new Zhongyong Hanli and other foreign firms set the price at 15 shillings and 5 pence per box for single-linked and 28 shillings and 3 pence per box for double-linked. It was found that it was shipped in September and October, and the price was calculated based on the current market exchange rate, and there was still a profit to be made. In addition, British plain white iron was also set to exit. The price was kept secret by various foreign firms, so there was no way to find out. The number of orders placed reached as many as 700 to 800 dan. The orders were all placed by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<p>Wang's Resignation Intent Is Firm, With No Room for Change</p>
<p>Tang Youren Returned to Shanghai Yesterday to Report to Wang</p>
<p>The resignation of Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, has been earnestly retained by various parties, but Wang's attitude is very firm, and there is no effect. Yesterday morning, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, sent Zhou Gengsheng as a special representative, accompanied by Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff, from Nanjing to Shanghai to persuade Wang. Yesterday morning, together with Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, and others, they went to Wang's residence on Pushi Road to visit Wang. Because Wang was not at home, Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, represented them in the negotiations. It was reported that Ms. Wang said at the time that Wang's attitude was extremely firm and asked the ministers not to retain him any further. They should proceed from a practical point of view. Therefore, representatives from all parties are already requesting instructions on how to proceed. Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Political Conference, who flew to Wuhan the day before yesterday to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, returned to Shanghai by China Airlines plane at 2:30 pm yesterday to report to Wang. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Zhu and Others Arrive in Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, sent Zhou Gengsheng, a representative to Shanghai to retain Wang, from Wuhan. After arriving in Nanjing the day before yesterday, he took the Nanjing-Shanghai night train with Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff, Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Minister of Railways, and arrived in Shanghai at about 8 am yesterday. After Zhou and Shi got off the train, they went to the hotel to rest. Zhu and Zeng returned to their Shanghai residences to rest.</p>
<p>Representatives Visit Wang Yesterday morning, the ministers in Shanghai and the representatives who had just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing were arranged by Zeng Zhongming to gather at Wang's residence on West Pushi Road at 8 am to discuss everything. Then they arrived one after another. He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, and Zhu Peide of the General Staff, first arrived at Wang's residence at 9:20. Then they went to pick up Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan. At 10:10, Zhu Jiahao, Minister of Education, Zhou Gengsheng, Chiang's representative, and Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, also arrived in the same car. About a quarter of an hour later, Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Minister of Railways, also arrived. However, Wang himself was not at home, so in addition to the above-mentioned people, Chen Bijun, Wang's wife, represented Wang in the discussion. They talked for about an hour before they all left and returned to their residences. As for the content of the discussion, see Zhou Gengsheng's statement for details.</p>
<p>Zhou Gengsheng's Talk Zhou Gengsheng, the representative of Chiang Kai-shek, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He once went to visit Wang with Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, and others, and brought Chiang's handwritten letter to Wang, but he did not get to meet him. A reporter from the New Voice Society specifically visited Zhou's residence yesterday afternoon. According to the talk, he came to Shanghai to handle the affairs of Wuhan University. He met Chiang Kai-shek when he left Wuhan. Chiang's expression on Wang's resignation was very clear, that is, he hoped that Wang would quickly resume his position. When he met Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, today (i.e., yesterday), there were no results. What he talked about was only the personal talks of the representatives and ministers. However, Wang's resignation may not be effective with empty words of retention, and a practical solution must be found to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming's Talk Zeng Zhongming made the following statement to reporters yesterday: (1) Mr. Wang has left Shanghai to go to the countryside to recuperate, expressing his extremely firm attitude. Wang has no intention of resuming his position as President of the Executive Yuan at this time, and extremely hopes that Zhang Xueliang will resign and quickly select a successor to the new President of the Executive Yuan to avoid the long-term suspension of the central government. (2) The central government is unanimously advocating Zhang's resignation in terms of public opinion. For example, the Central Daily News, the New Kyoto Daily News, etc., have very clear expressions. However, in the Shanghai press, there seems to be a general idea that they want to speak but dare not. The central government is now the same as the Shanghai opinion faction on this point, because this point also has its unspeakable pain. (3) After Zhang's resignation, the Military Affairs Commission has not heard of any acceptance. If the central government officially approves Zhang's resignation, Wang will no longer be the President of the Executive Yuan, because this is the trial implementation of democracy. (4) Whether the ministers who sympathize with Mr. Wang will advance and retreat with Wang in the future is still uncertain at this time. It depends on the situation in the future. (5) I learned about Tang Youren's visit to Wuhan in the newspaper, and I heard that Wang's letter to Chiang was brought there.

<p>Song Ziwen's Actions Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, left for Hongqiao Airport at 6:30 yesterday morning, accompanied by Shen Dexie, Director of the Aircraft Factory, Mao Bangchu, President of the Aviation School, and five Westerners, driven by Mao Bangchu. The privately-owned Sikorsky plane departed, advanced along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and did not return to Shanghai until about 10 am at noon. It is reported that Song went to Hangzhou to inspect the newly built airport in Hangzhou. However, according to another rumor, Song went to Hangzhou to meet Wang Jingwei, or pre-arranged a meeting with Chairman Chiang, but because it was not confirmed, he did not dare to make a definite decision. However, Song's assistants are very secretive, and it seems that the latter statement may not be without reason.</p>

<p>Regarding the News of (The Increasingly Deteriorating Feelings of Chinese People Towards Japan) The Central News Agency also requested that each newspaper be careful in publishing it in the future. Since the Japanese newspapers in this port published the news of the escape of the patrol police from the Baziqiao Public Security Bureau branch, other rumors have arisen, and the hearts of the people in Zhabei have been floating again. The municipal government believes that this matter is completely unfounded and should be seriously corrected to stabilize people's hearts. At 4 pm the day before yesterday (10th), he specially protested to Murai Kuramatsu, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai. The copy of the protest letter is as follows: I would like to inform you that on the 6th of this month, the Japanese newspapers Shanghai Daily News, Shanghai Mainichi News, and Shanghai Daily News all published a news item about the escape of the patrol police from the Baziqiao Public Security Bureau branch. After investigating, the matters stated are all untrue facts, which are obviously shaking the hearts of the people in this city. If this is not corrected, the impact will be worrying. It is appropriate to write to your Consul-General and strictly order each newspaper to correct the records and order them to pay attention in the future. On the same day, the Shanghai Mainichi News and the Shanghai Daily News published a news item (The Increasingly Deteriorating Feelings of Chinese People Towards Japan), writing about a few trivial disputes between Chinese and Japanese people to conclude that the feelings of Chinese and Japanese people are deteriorating. Now, regardless of whether the content is true or not, this kind of record is enough to increase the ill will between the people of China and Japan, and I believe that your Consul-General also knows this deeply. It is also hoped that your Consul-General will forward this to each newspaper and ask them to be careful in publishing this kind of news in order to promote friendship. It is appropriate to enclose the records of the above-mentioned newspapers and send them to you. I hope that you will investigate and handle them and reply. This is addressed to Murai Kuramatsu, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, with the seal of Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Verdict on the Yun Huifang Case <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>The First Special Court Brought Yun Back Yesterday</p>
<p>｜Also Accused in the Bomb Plot Against Yu Ruiliang｜Yun Huifang, a member of the "Blood Soul Assassination Squad" and a teenager from Changzhou, learned that the Maochang Foreign Goods Store, opened by Ningbo native Shen Maochun at 347 Fahua Republic Road in the French Concession, was secretly selling Japanese goods. On the evening of the 5th of this month at 9 p.m., she took a hand grenade and threw it at the store, damaging the glass and floor. Yun was intercepted by the Chinese police on patrol and detained at the Second Precinct, Second District, of the Public Security Bureau in Chenxiangge. The French Concession Police Department's Political Section sent Chinese and Western detectives to bring Yun back to the police station. They also went with Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station of the Public Concession to Yun's residence at 207 Heng'an Lane, Qingdao Road, Parker Road, where they seized another bomb similar to the one used in the bombing, and deposited it at the Xinzha Police Station. The French Concession Police then sent Yun to the Second Special District Court, and prosecuted her for the crimes of endangering peace, forming a secret society, and causing damage, under Articles 158, 161, and 382 of the Criminal Code. The presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Wang Gangxu, together with Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke, held a court hearing. The defendant, Yun Huifang, was defended by three lawyers: Zhao Chen, Shen Junru, and Liu Hongxun. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter and a representative to the court, requesting leniency for the defendant. The debate was declared closed and a date was set for sentencing. The defendant was ordered to provide two shopkeepers as guarantors, which has already been reported. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. The defendant and her lawyers arrived at the court at 9 a.m. to await the verdict. At 10 a.m., Judge Wang, accompanied by Court Clerk Fang, came to Criminal Court One and called the defendant to the stand. After briefly questioning her age, origin, occupation, and address, he announced the verdict. The main text stated: "Yun Huifang is sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, for the two crimes of threatening others with harm to their lives and property, causing danger." After the sentencing, Luo Bo (transliteration), Deputy Western Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police Department, along with Deputy Chinese Inspector Liu Shaokui, and Deputy Inspectors Wang Debiao and Zhao Bingkun, and bailiffs from the First Special Court, claimed that the defendant was also involved in the case of plotting to bomb Yu Ruiliang at 729-731 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession at 7:30 a.m. on July 28. They requested that she be transferred to their custody for investigation and presented a letter from Zhou Xianjue, President of the First Special Court. Judge Wang examined the letter and ordered the defendant to be temporarily detained. The letter would be sent to the President of the Court for consideration. The lawyers immediately objected, but to no avail. At around 1 p.m., she was transferred to the Fuzhou Road General Inspectorate of the Public Concession. Lawyers Zhao Chen and Shen Junru, and Jiang Junyi, a representative from Changzhou, visited the Chinese and Western inspectors one after another to negotiate for her release, but were unsuccessful. Yun was still being treated well inside. It is said that she will be sent to the First District Local Court for trial at 9 a.m. today. Lawyer Li Zuyu will join the legal team. The official letter from the First Special District, signed by Zhou Xianjue, President of the First Special Court, stated that according to the General Inspectorate of the Public Works Department, the defendant Yun Huifang plotted to harm Yu Ruiliang with a bomb at 729-731 Xinzha Road at 7:30 a.m. on July 28. She is currently detained in the Second Special District Local Court, and they requested her transfer. Accordingly, they dispatched a detective with a letter to request clarification and to have Yun Huifang handed over to the detective to be brought back for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Slowdown Strike at the China Merchants Inland River Machinery Factory is Resolved <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Due to unpaid wages, the factory workers at the China Merchants Bureau's Inland River Machinery Factory demanded cash payment, leading to a slowdown strike by all workers. Yesterday, General Manager Li Guojie ordered the accounting department to raise some cash, and at the same time set a date for full payment. He also persuaded the workers to return to work first to avoid hindering operations. The workers resumed work at 3 p.m. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Main Reason for the Slowdown Strike: The China Merchants Inland River Machinery Factory is located in Lujiazui, Pudong. Repairs to the Bureau's inland river vessels and minor work on major ocean-going vessels have always been handled by the factory's workers. The factory also undertakes repairs for commercial vessels outside the Bureau. Since Li Guojie took office as General Manager, he has been very considerate of the lower-level workers, paying wages monthly, which the workers were quite satisfied with. However, the accounting department issued a check for 8,000 yuan for the June wages, but it was not cashed due to a shortage of cash. The workers repeatedly requested payment, but it was not paid. By the afternoon of the 10th, the workers began a slowdown strike.</p>
<p>Demand for Cash Payment: On the afternoon of the 10th, all the workers at the Inland River Machinery Factory went on a slowdown strike. All work in the factory was completely stopped. The ships waiting for repair in the dock were also stopped. The workers elected representatives to demand payment from the new Factory Manager Xing Qixin, stating that the workers' wages were limited, and they relied entirely on their meager wages. If payment was delayed, their lives would be difficult. They requested cash payment, and the slowdown strike was not their intention. Factory Manager Xing reported this to the General Manager.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds: Yesterday morning, Xing Qixin went to the General Bureau and reported to Li Guojie on the factory workers' slowdown strike and their request for wages. General Manager Li stated that since he took office, he had never delayed the monthly wages of the workers. The accounting department's issuance of checks this time was to regulate finances, and cash payments would be made in a few days. He immediately ordered the accounting department to allocate 2,000 yuan in cash to be distributed to the workers by the Factory Manager. The remaining amount would be paid in full on the 15th.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work in the Afternoon: Work at the machinery factory is related to shipping. Xing Qixin gathered the workers and the representatives conveyed General Manager Li's intentions, that a portion of the wages would be paid first, and the remainder would be paid in full on the 15th of this month. The workers were satisfied. After receiving their wages yesterday, they all resumed work at 3 p.m. A slowdown strike came to an end, or so it seems.</p>
<h3 id="e154">British Public Bus Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Because the Company Did Not Fulfill Its Promise of a Wage Increase</p>
<p>A Strike Committee Was Formed and a Strike Declaration Was Issued</p>
<p>The Company Dismissed All Striking Workers. All ticket collectors of the British-owned Chinese Public Bus Company in the Public Concession went on strike yesterday morning, opposing the company's failure to fulfill its promise to increase wages and demanding the reinstatement of dismissed workers. They formed a strike committee and issued a declaration, presenting their conditions. The company held an emergency board meeting and reluctantly maintained traffic with a notice, dismissing all striking workers. The situation is very serious. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Background: All the ticket collectors opposed the company's oppression and went on strike last year. However, due to the harsh environment, they announced an unconditional return to work. In June of this year, the company's factory manager and transportation manager, Xiao Date, directly negotiated with the workers' representatives. If the workers did not skim money, the company would increase wages. At that time, the workers' representatives stated that they would not skim money after the wage increase. Starting from the 8th of this month, the company changed the 1, 9, and 10 bus routes to segment fares and issued a notice to the workers, saying, "(Because the practice of ticket collectors' embezzlement is becoming more and more serious, the factory manager and others have repeatedly advised the representatives. Before the ticket collectors can change their ways and stop embezzling, there is no possibility of raising wages. After the Sino-Japanese War, business has plummeted. Our company still protects all employees without layoffs, which is comforting to the staff. Therefore, if the ticket collectors can improve themselves and never embezzle, to assist the company, the company will seriously consider rewarding them. This is to inform all ticket collectors, take note, Factory Manager Xiao Date)."</p>
<p>Conditions Presented: The ticket collectors were very angry about the company's notice, believing that the company did not fulfill its promise to increase wages. They specially invited representatives from steelworkers, drivers, and ticket inspectors to the Jiuyunxuan Restaurant the day before yesterday to discuss unified action and propose requirements. The requirements were jointly proposed by the representatives of each department, and each department unanimously demanded the signing of a strike agreement, expressing sympathy for the ticket collector strike. The conditions are recorded below: (A) Ticket Selling Conditions: (1) No worker shall be dismissed. All workers dismissed by Bill shall be reinstated immediately. (2) Increase wages to 40 yuan, with an annual increase of 3 yuan. (3) Restore the copper coin bonus, issued according to the original standard. Wages shall be paid during the strike period. (4) All new cards shall be exchanged, and shall be exchanged every six months thereafter. (B) Ticket Inspection Conditions: (1) Increase wages to a minimum of 50 yuan. (2) Working hours shall not exceed eight hours. (3) Restore the work of ticket inspector No. 66 and dismiss Bill. (4) Suspension with a one-year severance pay.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Formed: The ticket collectors held a joint meeting the night before last, organizing a strike committee, including a presidium, secretariat, propaganda department, disciplinary department, communication department, transportation department, and a fund management committee. The heads of each department, as well as the chairman and fund committee members, were immediately elected. A strike order was issued, and the collection of strike funds began. Each ticket collector paid one yuan to the fund. It was decided that the official strike would begin at 5:00 a.m. on the 11th. All disciplinary departments would be deployed to establish the strike committee's office and branch offices for each department's representatives.</p>
<p>Strike Order: After the strike committee announced the strike on the 11th the night before last, the transportation team separately notified the workers, and an emergency meeting was held at Jinshuilou. It was decided to send four representatives to the General Company on the Bund to present the conditions. At the same time, all the masses were mobilized to participate. The disciplinary team prepared to use force to expel the White Russians who were undermining the strike, earnestly uniting all the workers, including coppersmiths and drivers, to take unified action. An excerpt from the strike declaration is recorded below: The fact that imperialism is intensifying its oppression of workers after the war points out that increasing fares intensifies the exploitation of Chinese passengers, launching a unified attack on workers and passengers. It reiterates that the White Russians are destroying the interests of the workers and are lackeys of capital. Finally, it declares that this strike is to fight for conditions for the workers themselves and to win glory for the Republic of China. It earnestly requests all sectors and all Shanghai workers to provide practical assistance.</p>
<p>Buses Stop Running: At 5:00 a.m. yesterday, all the ticket collectors, and Korean ticket inspectors, carried out the strike order of the strike committee, and all routes of the public buses, including Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to Bazizhang, Route 2 from Eryangjing Bridge to Bazizilu, Route 3 from Caojiadu to Nanyang University, Route 4 from Jing'an Temple to Hongqiao, Route 5 from North Railway Station to Sanmaoge Bridge, Route 6 from Tilanqiao to Bazizhang, Route 7 from Caojiadu to Beixinjing, Route 9 from Jing'an Temple to the Electric Light Factory, Route 10 from Caojiadu to Yinxiangxiang, and ABCDE Special Express, A1 Special Bus, Jing'an Temple to Waibaidu Bridge, had to be completely stopped due to the lack of ticket sellers.</p>
<p>Board Meeting: The British-owned Chinese Public Bus Company held an emergency board meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. First, Factory Manager Xiao Date reported on the workers' strike. It was decided on the spot: (1) To notify the striking workers that those who were absent from work on the 11th would be dismissed. (2) To find ways to restore the operation of all bus routes to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>Notice to All Sectors: The British Public Bus Company issued a notice yesterday, saying, "Since our company changed to segmented fares, the ticket sellers took advantage of the opportunity to embezzle, and this morning (August 11) all abandoned their posts and went on an unconditional strike, resulting in our company being able to run only a very small number of vehicles, causing great inconvenience to the public. We feel deeply ashamed. In the shortest possible time and within the possible scope, our company will do its best to restore traffic to its original state, in order to live up to the expectations of all sectors."</p>
<p>Overall Dismissal: The British Public Bus Company announced yesterday that ticket sellers who were absent from work on August 11 would be dismissed. They should submit their uniforms and miscellaneous items. This announcement was made by Factory Manager and Transportation Manager Xiao Date.</p>
<p>Pledge Not to Resume Work: A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met with members of the strike committee yesterday. According to the released statement, the life of workers such as bus ticket sellers, drivers, ticket inspectors, sweepers, and coppersmiths is extremely miserable, with an average monthly salary of less than 20 yuan. Since the Shanghai Incident, the company has dismissed a large number of workers. In the past nine months, almost all the old ticket sellers have been replaced. The company also dismissed two drivers and one ticket inspector, and implemented changes in ticket colors, increased fares, and increased the work of workers, to</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>the point that the workers could not bear it any longer, and proposed conditions. The company had no sincerity in accepting, and instead prepared to dismiss everyone. Therefore, they had no choice but to announce a strike to awaken the company. Now the company has announced the dismissal of the strikers, but the strikers are determined to fight to the death and will not resume work until their goals are achieved.</p>
<p>Reluctant Traffic: From 1:00 p.m. yesterday, in order to maintain traffic and facilitate transportation, the company assigned ticket inspectors and checkers to perform ticket selling work, reluctantly running 14 buses on Route 1, 6 on A1, 5 on Route 2, 4 on Route 5, 20 on Route 9, 2 on A, 1 on C, 2 on B, and 1 on D. The rest were still suspended. They returned to the factory early at 8:00 p.m. As for the company's entrance on Kangnuo Road, police officers from the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station were stationed there to provide protection.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Conflict Between Workers of the Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanjing Road and Detectives <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Three Arrested Were Released Immediately</p>
<p>Petitioned the Municipal Government in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Convened Interrogation. After the Yinxiangxiang Sanyou Industrial Factory announced its closure, all the workers demanded the resumption of work, resulting in disputes. Although the Party and government organs repeatedly mediated, it has not been resolved yet. Because the company reduced the workers' food expenses, the workers went to the Nanjing Road retail department to petition yesterday morning, resulting in a conflict with the Western police, and seven people were injured. At that time, the situation was serious, and traffic was interrupted. In the afternoon, all the workers went to the Municipal Government to petition, and dispersed in the evening.</p>
<p>Reduced Food Expenses: After the Shanghai factory of the Sanyou Industrial Society was closed, the Municipal Government ordered the company to maintain food expenses. The Social Affairs Bureau decided that it should be 120 yuan per day. So far, it has been issued for the seventh week. In the sixth week, the company believed that the number of workers living in the factory had decreased, and insisted that the food expenses be reduced to 80 yuan per day. After detailed investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it advised the company to continue to maintain it reluctantly. As a result, all the workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. The Social Affairs Bureau advised them to temporarily receive 100 yuan per day, or 700 yuan per period. The day before yesterday, the trade union's Xia Zhongzhao accompanied Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau to the company to receive the seventh installment of food expenses. The company insisted on only 700 yuan per period and refused to supplement it.</p>
<p>Surrounding Petition: Afterwards, after Xia Zhongzhao of the trade union returned to the factory and reported to the workers, all the workers believed that the meager 160 yuan per day for food expenses was not enough to maintain the lives of more than 1,200 workers. If it was reduced again, it would be tantamount to putting the workers to death. Therefore, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, more than 250 people automatically gathered and went to the Nanjing Road Sanyou Industrial Society's retail department to petition, demanding (1) that the workers' food expenses be at least 120 yuan per day, and (2) that work be resumed as soon as possible to maintain the workers' livelihood. By 9:00 a.m., they arrived at the retail department and went upstairs. As a result, the shop on the ground floor, the second floor, and the third floor were all crowded. At the door, there was a banner written in bamboo cloth in Chinese and English: "We are fighting for the problem of food, please do not interfere by third parties."</p>
<p>Conflict Occurred: When the workers were petitioning, a special Western detective from the Laozha Police Station passed by and asked if the company had allowed the banner hung at the door. The staff of the retail department replied that it had not been allowed, and it was forced. As a result, the Western detective immediately went to report. Twenty minutes later, the Laozha Police Station dispatched more than 40 Chinese and Western armed detectives to drive away the petitioning workers and ordered them to go to the police station. At that time, the workers agreed to go to the police station as a whole. At that time, the Western detectives suddenly stopped them and drove the workers on the third floor to the second floor, and from the second floor to the shop downstairs. When they arrived downstairs, a conflict occurred between the workers and the police. Suddenly, phlegm, chairs, and orange peel were all weapons, and the order was in chaos. The detectives, seeing the large number of workers, frantically blew the whistle to call for reinforcements.</p>
<p>Traffic Interrupted: At that time, when the workers and police clashed, the Nanjing Road Sanyou retail department was extremely chaotic. Nearby detectives arrived after hearing the alarm. At that time, traffic was interrupted on Nanjing Road from west to Zhejiang Road and east to Fujian Road, and all kinds of vehicles were completely blocked and stopped. It was not until 11:00 a.m. that it returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Arrested Were Released Immediately: During the conflict, seven workers including Luo Ailin were injured. Three glass display windows of the retail department were shattered, and the counter was damaged by squeezing. At that time, three workers were arrested and taken to the police station. Afterwards, all the workers followed. The police, seeing the workers leaving the retail department, immediately closed the iron gate and prohibited the workers from entering and leaving. The arrested were taken to the Laozha Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, the police severely rebuked them, as the workers were first-time offenders and not initiators, and then released them leniently.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: Seeing that the iron gate of the retail department was closed, the petitioning workers hired a moving truck and went to the Municipal Government to petition. It was already after 1:00 p.m. At the same time, the workers who remained in the factory went to the Municipal Government after hearing the news, demanding (1) that the food expenses be issued strictly, at 120 yuan per day, and (2) that the murderers be punished. Secretary Wang Shaozhai then ordered the election of representatives Du Shouting, Bao Boyi, Xuan Lihe, Wan Quanfa, Zhang Tingliang, Chen Xinzhi, Gong Huanshan, Wang Xuecui, Qin Changgeng, and Hong Meishuo. Eleven</p>
<p>people went to see him. Regarding the workers' demands, he promised to investigate and deal with them immediately, and notified Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau, by telephone to rush to persuade and explain everything to the workers' representatives. It was not until 6:30 p.m. that the workers' representatives persuaded the workers to leave first.</p>
<p>Authorities Interrogate: The Social Affairs Bureau has appointed an accountant to audit the factory's closure dispute. In recent days, they have also consulted with the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government to find a solution as soon as possible. Yesterday afternoon, when representatives of the Sanyou Industrial Society of the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union were summoned for questioning, Xia Zhongzhao and Qin Haiyan were sent to the office at 3:00 p.m. Director Wang Xianqing of the mediation section happened to be away on his way to the Municipal Government, so Zhu Guilin received them and made a simple inquiry. However, the company's representatives were absent.</p>
<p>Company Statement: The Sanyou Industrial Society issued a statement yesterday, saying that the Sanyou Society's factory was occupied by the Japanese army during the January 28th Incident, and then withdrew on May 31st. On June 2nd, hundreds of workers moved in, demanding resumption of work and relief food. The Municipal Government reluctantly followed the petition, instructing the company to maintain it temporarily and provide appropriate relief. The Social Affairs Bureau, in consultation with the company in June, temporarily gave 120 yuan per day, so 840 yuan was taken away every week. It has been five weeks now. The company has repeatedly received reports that many workers have left the factory automatically because the problem has not been resolved for a long time, and that it has been a long time, which is different from the temporary significance. It requested the Social Affairs Bureau to reduce the payment. After investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it contacted the company and changed it to 100 yuan per day. This amount was received last week. The day before yesterday (10th), trade union representatives Xia Zhongzhao, Gong Zishen, and others, together with Social Affairs Bureau representative Zhu Guilin, continued to receive</p>
<p>The 700 yuan went away. Unexpectedly, the next day (11th), hundreds of workers suddenly went to the retail department on Nanjing Road and posted slogans on the glass windows, and were interfered by plainclothes detectives and patrolmen, almost resulting in violence. Three people were then arrested. Afterwards, the manager went to the police station and learned the whole story. As for the arrested workers, the police station, knowing that they were first-time offenders and not initiators, immediately gave them guidance leniently and ordered them not to take such unconscious actions in the future, lest they cause inconvenience. (The trade union also has a declaration to issue, which is omitted here.)</p>

<p>Inquired about the Chinese Political Situation. The Italian Minister to China, Qia Nuo, accompanied by the American Consul General in Shanghai, Ke Ninghan, went to the Maple Bridge Municipal Government yesterday morning to visit Mayor Wu and inquire about the changes in the Chinese political situation and the state of security in Shanghai. Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yu came out together to receive them. They briefly stated that President Wang had resigned, and the Central Government was earnestly trying to retain him. As for the joint advance and retreat of the heads of various ministries, it was a procedure of the responsible cabinet. Probably after President Wang dispelled his intention to resign, the central authorities would not shake. As for the issue of security in this city, since the signing of the armistice agreement and the withdrawal of Japanese troops as agreed, the reconstruction work in the war zone is being actively carried out by this government. It has now completely returned to the state before January 28th. As long as the Japanese troops in the concession do not lightly disturb the mainland and cause trouble, the security team and police under the jurisdiction of the municipal government can protect the local area, so that Chinese and foreign residents will not be alarmed by soldiers, etc. The meeting lasted about an hour, and they said goodbye with a handshake and left.</p>

<p>Reply to the Two Railway Party Departments. Special Committee of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Party Department, respectfully informed: The winter telegram has been read. The ambition of the strong enemy has long been pervasive. Preventing chaos and defending against insults depends on the same hatred.

<h3 id="e160">Wang Xiaolai Clarifies the Erroneous Report in the Japanese Newspaper <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency, regarding the report in the Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" published on the 10th of this month, which stated that the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Corps" was led by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, specifically visited Mr. Wang yesterday to inquire about the matter. According to Mr. Wang, he had no knowledge of the corps. The translation of the original report and Mr. Wang's statement are as follows:</p>
<p>Report in the Japanese Newspaper: It roughly stated that a group called the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Corps," which is currently vigorously promoting the boycott of Japanese goods by Chinese merchants through violent intimidation and other inappropriate behaviors, is unexpectedly led by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chinese Products Joint Association and the General Chamber of Commerce, who is the main figure behind the scenes. Most of the members of the corps are remnants of the Volunteer Army, numbering about fifty to sixty people. This matter has now been definitively confirmed, and there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Statement: Mr. Wang stated, "On the 26th of last month, I participated in the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group and went to Qingdao for inspection. Along the way, we passed through Weihaiwei and only returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 7th. Before I left Shanghai, I was unaware of the existence of the 'Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Corps.' When I returned to Shanghai, I saw it in the Shanghai newspapers a few days before the inspection. It is ridiculous that the newspaper claimed that I was the leader of the corps. I have always been open and aboveboard in my actions. If it were something I did, I would never be afraid to admit it. Otherwise, I would definitely not acknowledge it. As for the General Chamber of Commerce advising various trade associations to sever economic ties with Japan, it was based on resolutions passed by successive meetings of member representatives. As the chairman, it is my natural responsibility, along with other executive committee members, to implement the resolutions of the member representatives' meeting, regardless of any difficulties or dangers. This is what I can tell the public."</p>

<p>Lin Ding, the advisor to the American Civilian Government, Lin BaiKe, who left for the United States on the 13th, yesterday issued a formal report on his mission in the United States. He stated that the main purpose of his mission in the United States was to convey the Chinese government's response to the U.S. Senate resolution establishing the Pittman Subcommittee within the Foreign Relations Committee to the United States. The secondary purpose was to convey the cooperation of the Chinese people to certain American civil organizations, such as the International Silver Committee. Lin BaiKe's efforts in the United States also played a significant role in securing the loan granted by the United States last year for disaster relief. However, Lin BaiKe encountered some disappointment regarding future loans to China. The news of frequent separatist movements in China was particularly disappointing to friends in the United States who supported China. Mr. Lin is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 13th, taking the route through Europe before returning to the United States.</p>

<p>Technician Zhou Tieming arrived in Shanghai yesterday for the China Aviation Corporation. To facilitate North-South transportation, preparations for the Shanghai-Tianjin route have been actively underway. The original plan was to inaugurate the route on the [blank] of this month. However, due to the airport land foundations at Haizhou and Qingdao being manipulated by some individuals, civilians have taken advantage of the situation, deliberately raising prices or even refusing to sell or lease. Furthermore, some unscrupulous individuals have secretly stolen public property and disrupted the process. As a result, the preparations for the inauguration have been quite difficult. General Manager Liu Peiquan of the company, recalling that the Ministry of Communications dispatched technician Zhou Tieming to assist in the preparation of Tianjin Airport and other matters during the previous preparation of the Beijing-Pingjin route, which proceeded smoothly, specifically requested the Ministry of Communications to dispatch personnel to assist in the preparation of the Shanghai-Tianjin route's airport stations, in order to alleviate the difficulties in preparation and to achieve an early official inauguration. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications has approved the request and dispatched technician Zhou Tieming, who previously assisted in the preparation of the Beijing-Pingjin route's station, to consult with the local government and assist in all matters, given his experience. It is heard that technician Zhou arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After meeting with General Manager Liu Peiquan of the company, he will depart for Haizhou, Qingdao, and other places to work with the company's station personnel to prepare for the opening of the airport stations. As soon as the airports are completed, the official inauguration date will be set.</p>

<p>German Consul Unable to Attend Due to Illness. Yesterday was the anniversary of the German Parliament's declaration of the Republican Constitution, also known as the Weimar Constitution. The local German community held its routine celebrations. However, due to the German Consul-General Kerlenburg's ongoing illness, the Consulate General did not hold a meeting to receive congratulations as usual. Only German community groups and clubs held celebrations, all with great excitement. On November 9, 1918, two days after the armistice, Emperor Wilhelm of Germany announced his abdication. Subsequently, the National Assembly took over the government, announced the dissolution of the Parliament, and established a republic. The following January, the Parliament was elected and convened in Weimar on February 6. On February 11, Ebert was elected as the first president. Subsequently, on July 31, the new constitution was drafted and promulgated on August 11, marking the Constitution Memorial Day.</p>

The original text is as follows: Notice: The fishing grounds in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang waters are vast, and the number of fishing households is large and complex. Due to the uneven quality of the fishermen, it is inevitable that criminals and thieves will be harbored. In order to facilitate protection and ensure thoroughness, this administration, in accordance with the provisions of its organizational regulations, will implement fishing boat inspections and assign fishing boat license plate numbers. All fishing boats, regardless of their origin, within the jurisdiction of this administration must, within one month from the date of this notice, uniformly comply with the fishing boat management regulations of this administration and apply for fishing boat license plate numbers. In addition to issuing separate orders to various patrol vessels, fishing protection teams, and offices to comply with this order, this notice is hereby issued for general knowledge.

We, the people in the rear, should donate generously if rich, and donate sparingly if poor. Because the Northeast Volunteer Army sent representatives to Shanghai to request material assistance from all sectors. If everyone does not unite to provide assistance now, it will be too late to provide assistance when the country is lost in the future. I think the situation is imminent and cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, I have donated all the 16 yuan I have saved from reducing my daily food expenses, in order to fulfill the responsibility of a citizen in the rear. When the time is critical, I will go to the front line to fight. I hope that all my fellow countrymen will rise up and imitate me, a peddler.</p>

<p>Request to Anhui Provincial Government for Commendation.

<p>Beneficial to Farmland, Reduces Plague Atmosphere</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been extremely hot, often around 100 degrees. Due to the drought, many of the rice paddies in the surrounding countryside have withered and yellowed. Farmers have been longing for a heavy rain, but the scorching sun has continued without any sign of rain. Yesterday, from morning to evening, dark clouds gathered and scattered in the sky. In the Nanshi area, there was a heavy rain for a few minutes around 4 PM, but it stopped quickly. Around 9:30 PM, there was a sudden thunderstorm with heavy rain. It lasted for about an hour. Some roads overflowed onto the stone steps because the ditches could not drain the water in time. Although the amount of rainfall was not large, the farmland has been sufficiently moistened. The plague atmosphere in various places can also be reduced by the coolness after the rain.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Garbage Problem in Concessions <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Accumulated in Longhua Mouth, Land Leased in Chinese Territory</p>
<p>Annual Cleaning Fee of 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The garbage problem in the Shanghai concessions has been difficult to solve for a long time. The Public Concession once dumped garbage into the Suzhou River, which aroused opposition from all sides. Later, there was a proposal to melt the garbage with machinery, but it was not realized due to the excessive cost. Recently, negotiations have begun with the Chinese authorities to find suitable open space in the wilderness area of the city for accumulation. It is heard that a piece of land of about 150 acres has been found in the Longhua Mouth area, which can accumulate more than six years of garbage. According to the current estimate, the Chinese territory produces about 400 to 500 tons of garbage per day, the French Concession the same amount, and the British Concession 500 to 700 tons. The garbage is transported by barge to the site for accumulation every day. There are no residents within three or four miles of the site, so there is no impact on hygiene. Moreover, the site is currently a low-lying area, which can be leveled after six years of accumulation. This is a win-win situation. The concession authorities have now decided to pay the municipal government a cleaning tax of 200,000 yuan per year (80,000 yuan for the French Concession and 120,000 yuan for the Public Concession). The Sanitation Bureau will allocate this revenue specifically for garbage disposal, such as building garbage wharves, building garbage barges, garbage trucks, etc. Judging from past circumstances, the municipal government's annual expenditure on garbage disposal is about 80,000 yuan. With the addition of this 200,000 yuan, it can be said that it will be much more convenient to handle sanitation affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Case of Indian Police Killing Chinese <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Four Witnesses Questioned Yesterday</p>
<p>The trial of five Indian police officers, Sasa Mungen and Aladaite, etc., from the Lizezhongli Guanlong district of Feihong Road in Hongkou, who prevented tenants from moving and stabbed Zhou A'yu to death and injured Yi A'san on the 2nd of this month, was continued yesterday at the British Public Hall. The judge was Haynes. The defendant, the Chinese Business Company, appointed lawyer Levenson to appear in court to defend them. Yesterday, the witnesses Wilson, Zhang Hongyuan, Mao Baifu, and Baden were questioned. The first witness, Wilson, testified that he was an assistant surveyor at the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council and had surveyed Lizezhongli, and presented several maps of the section to the court for reference. The second witness, Zhang Hongyuan, testified that he was an employee of the Huafang Photo Studio at No. 11 Wuhua Road, Zhabei. On the morning of August 3, at 11 AM, he was ordered by the Zhabei police to take photos of the deceased in Lizezhongli. He saw a male Chinese person, approximately 20 years old or older, lying straight on the ground, with blood stains on his body. The photographic negatives submitted to the court were the ones he had taken. As for the location of the corpse on the map, he could not be completely sure, as he did not often go to that area and was not very familiar with the terrain. The third witness, Mao Baifu, testified that he was a photographer at the Public Works Department and had taken several photos of the building addresses and the corpse in Lizezhongli. The photos submitted to the court were the ones he had taken. The fourth witness, Baden, testified that he was a doctor at the British Consulate and had examined the corpse at the Shaoxing Guild Hall in Zhabei on August 5 with forensic doctor Wei Ligong. After opening the coffin, he found that the corpse had decomposed, but he found a clear wound on the chest. He examined the wound and found that it was approximately one inch deep between the fourth and fifth ribs on the left chest. The wound was likely caused by a broad and long knife. The injury was very serious and could have been caused by a forceful thrust by the murderer or a sharp blade. Therefore, even a very healthy person would have died from such an injury. The small steel knife submitted to the court was similar to the murder weapon. After this testimony, the court adjourned. The witnesses Dong Wushi, Hong Erbao, Hong Kaifa, Chen Yaxi, Xu Junchuan, Shi Yanqi, Wang Jinfu, Pan Zhengling, etc., will continue to be questioned today. It will take three or four days to complete the questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Verdict of the Russian Beggar Case <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Zongxiang and Two Others Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Abandoned Leading to Death Not Accepted. The case of the Russian beggar, Qiaoqiladitide Ai'fu, who died in the Second Special District Court Detention Center on June 19, was suspected to have been caused by injuries inflicted by prison guards, according to a report by the corpse examiner, Simon Grantki, who claimed that the beggar was not treated and died. The Police Department prosecuted the warden of the detention center, Xu Chongwen, forensic doctor Yu Minggao, and the prison guard Zhou Zongxiang in the Second Special District Court, accusing them of abandonment leading to death under Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. After the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Wang Gang, opened the court for trial, he hired the famous British and French forensic experts Tu Weiliyao and Si Mis, together with the court's forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Xuan Wei, to re-examine the corpse. The result determined that the death was indeed caused by illness. The defendants were defended by five lawyers, Zhao Chen, Liu Shixiong, Shan Yuhua, Li Cishan, and Jiang Yiping. After the closing arguments were concluded, the sentencing was scheduled for 9 AM yesterday. The previous report had already recorded the circumstances. At 9 AM yesterday, the defendants and their lawyers arrived at the court to await instructions. The Police Department was still represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen. At 10 AM, presiding judge Wang and court clerk Fang Mengzhou arrived at Criminal Court One and called the defendants and plaintiffs to the court. After briefly questioning their age, origin, occupation, and address, the verdict was announced. The main text stated, "Zhou Zongxiang, Xu Chongwen, and Yu Minggao are all found not guilty. The part of Zhou Zongxiang's case that involves abandonment leading to death is not accepted. Zhou Zongxiang will remain on bail from his original guarantor. Yu Minggao will be released on bail from his shop guarantor."</p>
<h3 id="e172">Taxpayers' Association Sends Another Letter to the Municipal Council Opposing Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Public Prosperity Depends on Individual Prosperity</p>
<p>Automatic Telephone Still Difficult to Connect, Are People Satisfied? The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association sent a letter yesterday to the General Office of the Public Concession Municipal Council, stating: "Dear Sirs, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Association stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company has increased telephone usage fees from 42 taels to 65 taels per year for residential users and from 78 taels to 105 taels per year for commercial users, effective July 1st of this year, and must be applied retroactively to March 27th of this year. Although the Municipal Council opposed this increase beforehand, it did not respect the opinions of the taxpayers' representative bodies and approved it anyway. The only reason given was that the Municipal Council was bound by the contract signed with the company two years ago and had to follow the Anson report. However, the Municipal Council disregarded the economic depression and the social and economic difficulties, and only cared about the company's profit of 8% plus 2%, totaling 10%, which is unfair. As everyone with legal knowledge knows, the strength of international treaties is stronger than contracts, and the effect of the international debt contract is the same as that of the contract signed by the Municipal Council and the company. When US President Hoover, in view of the world's economic difficulties and at the request of the debtor countries, implemented a one-year moratorium on war debts last year, he was willing to relax the terms of the debt contract. On July 9th of this year, the Lausanne Conference in Europe, under the principle of British Prime Minister MacDonald (Public prosperity depends on individual prosperity), greatly reduced the reparations paid by Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, as determined by Dawes and Young, to only a fraction of Young's number, and stipulated that the bonds would only be issued after three years if business recovered, or never issued within fifteen years, which shows how clear-sighted European and American politicians are (Individual prosperity must be maintained in order to maintain public prosperity). They are willing to change international treaties, but who would believe that the members of the Municipal Council are not aware of this and cannot negotiate a change with the Shanghai Telephone Company? Some say that the only purpose of the Municipal Council is to keep public utility organizations in a particularly advantageous position, and the interests of taxpayers are secondary. The Association does not agree with this, but the price increase of the electricity company, the change of electricity bills from quarterly to monthly, the failure to return two-thirds of the deposit, the price increase of the water company, and the use of water meters, which has increased water bills by more than seven times, show that the Municipal Council has approved the telephone company's request in the same way, just as it did in the autumn of economic depression and market decline. It is difficult to silence those who hold the above view. Your council is the representative body of taxpayers within the concession. We specifically request that you investigate and strive to achieve the goal of canceling the telephone price increase. The above is the reason. In response to this, the Association believes that the reason for the economic downturn is to write to your bureau to express opposition. We are honored to have received a reply stating that the board of directors has considered it, but we are sorry that the results of the consideration have not been shown. As for the opinions of the Citizens' Association, the Association believes that they are very reasonable, but the Association has one more point to add, that is, (press the automatic machine) but it is still not easy to talk to people, whether (performance) can be called (satisfactory), and (not retroactive) is a legal principle, but now it wants to increase prices retroactively to March 27th, The Association agrees with the opinion of the Da Mei Evening News, and there are users who often suffer from poor condition during the two-year repair period. Once they press the automatic machine on March 26th, they want to bear the price increase, and they completely ignore the loss of name but not reality during the two years, which is also not considered in terms of fairness. It is appropriate for the Shanghai Telephone Company to allocate a large amount of money to re-price, and more technicians to rush to press the automatic machine to avoid the punishment of postponement. I deeply understand that what your bureau considers satisfactory is interpreted as (press the automatic machine), not as (full performance). In terms of law, facts and economic conditions, the telephone price increase is really not feasible under the current situation. We should write to your bureau again to consider and negotiate with the company to cancel it, and wait until the performance is complete and the social economy is restored before discussing it again. This is addressed to the General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Song Liufa's House in Huangjia Yan, Liudao Township, Investigated. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to the Shanghai County Government's letter No. 206, the report from Zhao Lian, Director of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau of this county, states that Yang Hui, a patrol officer from the First Police Station, reported that he had learned on July 3rd that Song Liufa's house in Huangjia Yan, Liudao Township, was hiding a young boy of four years old. The officer immediately led a long police officer to arrest him and found the harboring offender, Song Liufa, and the four-year-old boy at the scene. After a preliminary interrogation, Song Liufa confessed that the boy was sent to his house by his friend, Fu Lou, a master of the Master Fang Xiang Sheng, and that he did not know the details. It was found that the bandit leaders Fang Xiang Sheng, Fu Lou, and Huang Wenxian, etc., all lived in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai, and had not been arrested. Fearing that they would escape after hearing the news, the Shanghai County Government was reported to send police to arrest them and bring them back for verification. Based on this, the officer immediately conducted a preliminary interrogation. Song Liufa's confession was roughly the same as the police station's report, but the exact location where the boy was kidnapped could not be determined until Fu Lou and others were arrested and brought to justice. Therefore, the confession was copied and Song Liufa and the boy were sent together for interrogation. At the county level, Song Liufa confessed that the boy was sent by Zhou Yusheng (Fang Xiang Sheng), who lived in the city. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau Sixth District was also contacted to arrest Zhou Yusheng and bring him back for interrogation. At the same time, Zhao Lian, Director of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau of this county, was ordered to summon Song Liufa's wife, Song He Shi, to the county for interrogation. After separate interrogations, Zhou Yusheng firmly denied that he had sent a boy to be raised, and Song Liufa and his wife Song He Shi also gave conflicting confessions. Involving a criminal case, in addition to sending Zhou Yusheng, Song Liufa, Song He Shi, and the boy to the Shanghai District Court for investigation, a photo of the boy, whose name and address are unknown, is also sent. Please check the photo and publish it in the news column so that the boy's family can read it and come to claim him. Sincerely, Shanghai Public Security Bureau. A photo is attached."</p>
<h3 id="e175">Raid on an Opium Den in Yü-Ch'ing Lane, Amoy Road <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>An Elderly Man of Sixty Still Engaged in Illegal Activities. Shanghai, a place where people from all corners of the world gather, is a mixture of good and bad. Illegal activities occur in endless succession, such as the sale of opium and distribution of narcotics. Although the National Government's laws explicitly prohibit these and the police conduct strict investigations, these lawless elements still employ cunning tricks to sell them openly. A scoundrel named Wang, residing at No. 206, Lane 4, Yü-Ch'ing Lane, Amoy Road in this city, privately established an opium-selling operation and set up several opium couches for people to smoke, indulging in clouds of smoke. This had been going on for more than a day. Yesterday, the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Police Station received a tip-off. After repeated secret investigations by detectives, the information was found to be accurate. At 11:00 AM, West District Inspector Pan Ken-sz, along with Chinese Detectives Sung Ping-cheng, Chen Yao-ting, and the entire armed force, drove police vehicles to the address. They apprehended the main suspect, Wang, a woman, and confiscated a small jar of opium paste, three large bags of raw opium, opium pipes, lamps, trays, and a large number of other prohibited items from the residence at No. 206 Yü-Ch'ing Lane. After the search, the detectives temporarily detained the suspects at the Old Zhabei Police Station, pending transfer to the court today for trial. It is said that the internal layout of the opium den was quite sophisticated, and the hiding place for the opium was particularly ingenious. The main suspect, Wang, is nearly sixty years old. It is truly lamentable that he is engaging in such illegal activities at his advanced age.</p>

<p>Recovery of the Yangtze Wharf. The Yangtze Wharf in Pudong was taken back from German merchants during the European War. Afterwards, the Japanese Ocean Company leased it from the Ministry of Communications of the former Northern Government for a period of five years. After the lease expired, the Japanese company, having made substantial profits, forcibly renewed the lease for another five years with the Ministry of Communications. Even after the second term expired, they were unwilling to return it to China. After the establishment of the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through various negotiations, finally regained the wharf from the Japanese. It is now under the management of the Ministry of Communications. However, last year, a Mr. Chen and others organized the China Wharf Company and leased the Yangtze Wharf from the ministry for 200,000 yuan. A contract was signed, but the rent was overdue. The Ministry of Communications has announced the cancellation of the China Company's lease and will seek new tenants for the wharf.</p>
<p>Merchant Ship Loses Anchor in Storm. The various merchant ships chartered by the Ministry of Military Affairs to transport the 19th Route Army to Amoy and other locations have now completed their mission and are beginning to be released. The first ship, "Fairness," has already arrived in Shanghai. The second ship, "Chia-ho," also sailed from Amoy back to Shanghai. According to a telegram from the ship yesterday, it encountered a strong wind shortly after leaving the Amoy sea. It anchored temporarily to avoid the storm, but the wind and waves were too strong, and the anchor chain broke. One of the starboard anchors was lost in the sea, along with ninety feet of iron chain. The "Chia-ho" ship is safe. The lost anchor and chain have been reported to the Amoy Navy for salvage.</p>
<p>Inferior Goods Shipped to North China. The Japanese ship "Hua Shan Maru" departed today for Qingdao, Tianjin, Dalian, and other ports, carrying a large quantity of inferior cloth and Japanese kelp to North China. Yesterday, the ship was docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf, loading these inferior goods for export in significant quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Bandits Opened Fire on Police During Arrest Attempt on Husi Kaixuan Road <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Police Sergeant Hsu Kuo-jen of the Second Precinct, Sixth District of the Husi Municipal Police Bureau, along with patrol officers from the Ta-hsi Road Police Station, patrolled back and forth along the K'ai-hsüan Road area, an extraterritorial road, yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM. As they walked in front of the railroad crossing, they noticed shadowy figures whispering to each other. Sergeant Hsu, considering the late hour, determined that they were not good people. He shouted the password and was about to approach for a search when the bandits suddenly opened fire. Sergeant Hsu immediately ordered the officers to crouch on the ground and return fire. The number of bandits continued to grow, reaching about twenty or more, and they surrounded the four police officers. Fortunately, Patrol Inspector Chang Chung-te of the station and Police Sergeant Chou Yi-ta of the Fa-hua Police Station heard the gunshots and led officers from all directions to surround the area. A fierce gun battle ensued, with bullets raining down. The two sides exchanged fire for about a hundred rounds over approximately forty minutes. Realizing they were outnumbered, the bandits began to flee north. The patrol officers pursued them, but lost them near the Fan-wang-tu Bridge on Chung-shan Road due to the darkness. They returned to the station to report the situation and await further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Landlord Forcing Tenant to Death in Pudong <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Causing Public Outrage. Various Labor Unions Petition Authorities for Strict Punishment of Landlords. The petition requests justice in the matter of landlords coercing human lives. The unions recently received a report from Widow Lu Hu of No. 12, Stone Bridge, Muddy Ford, Pudong, stating that while her husband was alive, he had rented the house from landlord Ku Lung-lung for nearly twenty years. On May 16, 1930, her husband, Ming-chung, was forced to commit suicide by poison due to a debt dispute with Ku Lung-lung. Everyone knew about this. At the time, the landlord asked someone to intercede, pleading to avoid prosecution. The widow, being a woman, was both intimidated by his power and limited by her financial situation. She harbored a great grievance but did not dare to speak out. Her family of six depended entirely on her husband to support them. After his death, the family's circumstances gradually deteriorated. They lacked sufficient food, and the monthly rent relied entirely on her borrowing from all sides. Since last year, their livelihood has become increasingly difficult, and debts have piled up, making it impossible to pay the rent. This year, they have been affected by the war, frequently facing food shortages, and are even less able to cover the accumulated rent. Landlord Ku Lung-lung disregarded their old friendship and forced them to move out. The widow begged for leniency, promising to find a new place to move within seven weeks. She found a house owned by Ku Ah-san, preparing to move there. Unexpectedly, the new landlord and Ku Lung-lung were relatives. Ku Lung-lung secretly sabotaged the arrangement, claiming that the house had already been rented to someone else, and returned the deposit of three yuan after three days of negotiations. She tried to find another house, but it was difficult to find a suitable location in a short time. The widow searched all day in the heat, exhausted. Landlord Ku Lung-lung showed no sympathy and came to her house yesterday afternoon, demanding that she move out immediately, and verbally abused the widow unreasonably. The neighbors witnessed this and felt indignant. The widow, unable to bear the coercion and humiliation, attempted suicide that evening. She was discovered, but it was too late to save her. Alas, within two years, both her husband and her mother-in-law were forced to death by the landlord. Ku Lung-lung relies on his wealth and believes he can manipulate everything. What difficulty would there be in escaping punishment for these mere human lives? Her husband's revenge has not been taken, and now another grievance arises from her mother-in-law's death. If this injustice is not redressed, how can she bear to continue living in this world? Therefore, she cries out to the association to uphold justice and provide assistance. Both the deceased and the living will be grateful. The unions have previously filed a case regarding disputes over rent reduction. Now, the landlord Ku Lung-lung, relying on his property rights, oppresses the widowed and helpless, resulting in two major tragedies. People are not made of wood or stone; who would not be outraged upon hearing this? In order to uphold humanity and protect human rights, the unions cannot stand idly by in the face of this situation. Therefore, they report the facts and petition the association to immediately punish the landlord according to the law for the crime of relying on wealth to coerce human lives, thereby preventing further illegal acts and comforting the souls of the wronged. After receiving the weeping plea for assistance from the tenant Lu Hu, the Pudong Rent Reduction Association immediately dispatched Cheng Hsieh-cheng, Chang Tzu-ping, Sung Pei-chi, Liu Hai-ju, and four others to investigate. That evening, they convened an emergency meeting to discuss assistance measures. They decided to (1) issue a declaration; (2) petition higher authorities to uphold justice and quickly revise rent reduction standards to prevent future tragedies; (3) inform tenants, based on the notice from the Municipal Rent Reduction Association and the resolution of the joint meeting of various organizations on August 6, that they should temporarily postpone rent payments until the central government reviews and revises the standards; and (4) issue a declaration supporting the Municipal Party Committee's rent reduction efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e181">News from Various Trade Associations <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Marine Products and Grocery Trade: The Marine Products and Grocery Trade Association originally had over sixty members. Since the September 18th Incident, due to the impact of the boycott of Japanese goods, nearly half of them have closed down. Of the remaining thirty or so, seven or eight are in the process of liquidation due to financial difficulties. The majority of the rest are engaged in domestic marine products, Sichuan-Hankou groceries, or Western goods. Unexpectedly, at this precarious time, the association received a letter from the Ten-Man National Salvation Group. The association urgently convened an emergency meeting of all members yesterday. After deliberation, everyone agreed that the Tung-sheng firm mentioned in the group's letter was indeed a member of the Shanghai Marine Products Trade Association and not something that the association could overstep its authority to address. The Tung-hui firm has already closed down, making it impossible to investigate. However, the Chen-ta, Shun-cheng, Heng-shun, and Hsieh-chang firms should be ordered to provide truthful written responses within two days. At the same time, member trades were urgently notified to fill out voluntary statements. The association will hire investigators to conduct investigations at any time. If any member is found to be selling enemy goods secretly, after the association verifies the evidence, their market license will be revoked, and their crimes will be announced in the newspaper in order to thoroughly implement the association's policy of perpetual economic severance with Japan. The emergency notice reads: "Concerning the urgent notice, based on a letter from the Ten-Man National Salvation Group, etc., it has been investigated that Tung-sheng firm is a member of the Marine Products Trade Association, and Tung-hui firm has already closed down, so there is no need to discuss it. The Chen-ta and other four firms have already been decided by the general meeting to provide truthful written responses. All other members should fill out voluntary statements and submit them to the association. If any member is found to be selling enemy goods secretly, after the association verifies the evidence, their market license will be revoked, and their crimes will be announced in the newspaper in order to warn others. It is hoped that all members will conduct themselves properly. Regarding the sale of enemy goods, correct them if they exist, and work harder if they do not. Otherwise, if danger occurs, it will be too late for regret. Please make an effort to act accordingly. A voluntary statement form is issued to be filled out and returned as required. This is specially notified."</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Trade: The Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Association convened a meeting of its members yesterday afternoon, chaired by Tsai Yu-k'un, to thoroughly investigate the sales of Japanese rice by its members, including Tung-hsing-tai and Jen-tai-san firms. The chairman reported that since the incident in the Eastern Provinces, the association had convened a meeting of its members, severed economic ties with Japan, and prohibited the use of Japanese ships. Fearing that members might engage in private buying and selling, the executive committee convened a special meeting in May of this year and resolved to resist to the death and never trade with Japan. If any member violated this resolution, upon discovery, they would be expelled from the association, barred from operating in the market, and the market would be notified. Recently, it was discovered that Tung-hsing-tai was selling Japanese rice. The association sent a letter to the firm, requesting a report on the ship that transported the rice, the date of arrival, and the details of the amount. The firm replied promptly. The rice stored in various warehouses was examined by the public, and it was found that the shipping details reported for three lots did not match the arrival date. This matter is currently under investigation. Suddenly, a letter was received from the North Office of the Bean and Rice Trade, requesting an investigation into Jen-tai-san's exclusive sale of Japanese rice. At the previous meeting, the undersigned was assigned to work with Committee Member Chiang Hung-bin of the Bean and Rice Trade Association and the North Office to investigate the firm. Unexpectedly, the next day, an advertisement was published in various newspapers stating that the Rice Shop Trade Association had sent personnel to investigate the Jen-tai-san, San-tai, and Kai-tai rice shops. They also inspected the books of Jen-tai-san firm, which showed no exclusive sales of Japanese rice, proving everything. However, yesterday a letter was received from the Blood Soul Extermination Group and others, stating that the treacherous merchants Tung-hsing-tai and Jen-tai-san were selling Japanese rice, requesting a thorough investigation, and a letter was received from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing a warning to be given to colleagues to quickly stop selling Japanese goods. The letters were presented to the members for review and a discussion of measures. After discussion, it was decided that since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had already organized an investigation team, a letter should be sent immediately requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send personnel to the meeting. This association will send personnel to thoroughly investigate Tung-hsing-tai, Jen-tai-san, and other firms, and members are warned not to trade with Japan again. If they violate this, they will be severely punished. If members wish to trade goods, they must register with the association, regardless of the goods, in order to facilitate investigation. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Clock and Watch Trade: Clock and watch shops, such as Chung-mei and Chung-fa, had already received warnings. Yi-cheng and Sun-kuang-hsing recently received warnings. Upon hearing this news, the Clock and Watch Trade Association sent Secretary Yu Shih-fo to investigate. According to Yu Shih-fo, after thoroughly checking the accounts, there were no new imports. However, upon inspecting the display windows, items were displayed. It is suspected that these were old sealed goods that were privately unsealed and sold. The Extermination Group saw them on display and suspected they were new imports. It is heard that the trade association has replied, ordering the firms to reseal the goods.</p>

<p>The Trade Union Resolves Most of Its Demands. The French Water and Electricity Company had a Russian employee, who was not proficient at driving, drive a car out of the factory the day before yesterday. The employee crashed and killed Chen Yung-ch'ing, who was assigned to the car. The trade union convened an emergency board meeting, and the family members also arrived to request three demands. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the company has generously provided compensation of 1,650 yuan for the first demand for bereavement compensation. The second demand was also agreed upon by both parties. Chen, the victim’s brother, will be allowed to work in the factory within the next year or two to continue his brother's work.

<h3 id="e184">Two Legal Wives <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>It's Always Hard for the Husband. Chang Ta-pao, a native of Yangzhou, is 35 years old. He runs a knitting machine factory on Huei-ning Road in Shanghai. In 1929, following his parents' orders and the words of a matchmaker, he married a woman named Xie (currently 28 years old) in his hometown of Yangzhou. After the wedding, Chang did not bring Xie to Shanghai, leaving her at home to help his parents with farming. The following year (1930), they had a son, who sadly passed away this spring. Xie repeatedly sent letters to Shanghai, but her husband did not return home. Therefore, last month, she took a ship to Shanghai from her hometown. After arriving at the factory, she saw that her husband had another woman. This woman claimed to be Chang Ta-pao's wife, and her husband echoed her claim. As a result, the couple often argued. The day before yesterday, an argument broke out over a trivial matter. Chang and his concubine beat Xie, kicking and punching her, and drove her out of the house. Xie had no choice but to go to her brother, Xie Shun-chi, who runs a tailor shop, Xie Shun-hsing, near the entrance of Hsi-hu Lane on Hsi-men Road in the French Concession, and complained about her husband and his concubine beating her. That evening, Xie took his wife and accompanied his sister back to Wang Ta-pao's factory, intending to ask Chang a few questions. Unexpectedly, Chang's concubine, preempting them, disheveled her hair. When Xie led his sister into the factory, she started to fight Xie without asking the circumstances, claiming that she was also a legal wife. The neighbors, seeing this, felt great indignation and called the police. The police took everyone to the Huei-ning Road police station in the Second District. The patrol officer, after asking the details, advised both parties to leave and let their elders mediate the family matter. Xie and his sister left the police station as instructed. However, Chang's concubine dared to fight Xie again on the way. The patrol officer witnessed the situation and summoned all the witnesses back to the district headquarters (Second District Headquarters). The chief briefly questioned them and then sent the case to the Procuratorate of the District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor held a preliminary hearing, repeatedly advising Xie that if she wanted to sue her husband, she would have to file a lawsuit in the civil court. The prosecutor then released Chang Ta-pao and his concubine, ordering them to mediate the matter. After leaving, Xie hired a lawyer to draft a complaint to the Shanghai District Court, accusing her husband of abandoning his legal wife.</p>

<p>Two national goods organizations telegraphed Consul Song, urging him to vigorously fight for the Shanghai citizens' advocacy of national goods association and the China National Goods Maintenance Association. Previously, the Philips Company, using the alleged patent for the vacuum pumping method of glass tubes, illegally encroached on the South Seas sales of light bulbs from the Yapuer Electric Factory, affecting the entire problem of overseas trade of national goods manufactured by foreign machines. They have already telegraphed the Consul General in Java, the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting them to argue based on reason, protect according to law, and also send letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Overseas Chinese Federation to assist in safeguarding national goods. Yesterday, they again telegraphed Consul Song in Java, stating the advantages and disadvantages and applying for a vigorous fight to maintain overseas trade of national goods. The original telegram reads: "To Song Jun, Consul General of the Republic of China in Batavia, Java: The situation of the Dutch merchant Philips light bulb company repeatedly excluding the national goods light bulbs of the China Yapuer Electric Factory has been detailed in the previous telegram. We believe that due to years of internal strife in our country, industry and commerce have declined, and the economy is in panic. The great powers are taking the opportunity to invade, and if economic invasion is not enough, they follow it up with force. Our country submits to adversity and is unable to resist. The great powers, therefore, regard us as turtles in a jar, doing whatever they want. For example, the Dutch merchant Philips company excludes Yapuer light bulbs, first preventing the sale of its Half bulbs. Seeing that we have no reaction, they take a further step to completely defeat us. This is not a matter of one day's deliberation. The reason why they are proceeding step by step is to test the strength of the unity of our people. They are not afraid of us, but they are sincerely afraid that if our people are united, it will affect the sales of their goods in China. Since they know that our people still hold the stubborn old idea of each sweeping the snow from their own door, they abandon the normal path of commercial warfare and do not hesitate to use this despicable means as a shortcut to defeat Chinese goods. We fear that soon after Yapuer light bulbs, those who are excluded will follow one after another. Is the future of our country's overseas trade and the source of livelihood for overseas Chinese still worth imagining? Yapuer light bulbs are one of the products of the factory, and also one of the national goods of our country. Sales in Java are part of the business of the Yapuer factory, and also part of our country's overseas trade of national goods. The loss is not much, as insignificant as a hair of nine oxen. However, the ambition of foreigners to invade will increase inch by inch and never stop. Looking ahead, the worries are very serious. Therefore, we telegraph again to state the advantages and disadvantages, and sincerely hope that you will fight for it according to reason. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. We beg you to review and verify, and if you grant our request, it will be for the public convenience. Wang Jie'an, Wang Hanqiang, and Wang Xingyi, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, Yu Hede, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Xu Chengru, and Zhang Dezai, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Citizens' Advocacy of National Goods Association, kowtow in unison."</p>

<p>Xia Xiuqing's firewood shop in Liuliqiao, Pudong, monopolized the rice straw business. Therefore, he hired Wang Laosan and his relatives Sun Xiangchun to specifically seize the business of firewood boats. A boatman from Songjiang sought to sell to another shop. Wang Laosan and Sun Xingchun went on board to threaten and extort commissions. The 18-year-old son of the firewood boatman refused, so he was stabbed to death with a knife. The local court detained Sun Xingchun and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Shen conducted the trial. Sun claimed that Wang Laosan went to extort and kill people, and he was cooking dinner at home and knew nothing about it. There was no evidence to the contrary. After the interrogating official asked Prosecutor Yang to the court to argue his opinion, he ordered the debate to end and awaited the verdict. The defendant was sent back to custody.</p>

<p>Continued Hearing Concluded</p>
<p>Qiu Xianrong Allowed to be Released. Peisheng Iron Factory, No. 734 Zhoujiazui Road, is opened by Chen Zhisheng, a native of Yong. Between the 26th of last month and the 3rd of this month, he received several threatening letters under the name of the Preparatory Committee of the Third Route Seventh Group of the Chinese Communist Party, demanding 100,000 yuan and asking him to publish a lost declaration advertisement in the News, indicating his willingness, with one yuan as a secret code of one thousand yuan, and agreeing to hand over the money near the Shunxintang Opium戒烟 Institute at No. 3 Hua'anfang, North Zhejiang Road. The Huishan Patrol Room was informed and sent Chinese detectives Qi Mengqing, Xu Bingnan, and Shen Binkui to arrest Ye Wu, a Yong woman, and a suspect named Qiu Xianrong, a Lu native in his seventies, at 3:15 pm on the 3rd of this month and escort them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin conducted a continued interrogation in the Fourth Criminal Court. The patrol room's lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that during the postponement, the victim received two more signed letters, one saying that the money should be delivered quickly, otherwise he would be shot with Brown Lin bullets, and the money should be sent to Zhou Zhenli or a Yang surnamed person at No. 516 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. Patrol Room detectives went to investigate and found no such person. The second letter said, "You are not doing things properly, relying on the power of the Patrol Room. Now send the money in silver dollars or banknotes to the same place. If you report to the Patrol Room again, your whole family will be killed," etc. He presented the two letters for inspection and stated that the mastermind of the case was Shi Laisheng, also known as A'er, the lover of the defendant Wu. The two letters were undoubtedly sent by him. The patrol room's investigation clarified that the second defendant, Qiu Xianrong, was not related to the case. He asked him to write and compared the handwriting, which was different. Therefore, he asked to release him first. Then, the victim Chen Zhisheng reported the situation of receiving the letter and publishing the advertisement. He questioned Ye Wu, who admitted to having known Shi Laisheng before, but had canceled it. She firmly stated that she did not know the details of the matter. At that time, Shi gave her a note asking her to go to Qiu Xianrong, that is, A'tai, to pick up a package containing ten yuan. She did not deliver it. Later, she met Patrol Room detectives on the way and gave the paper package to Shi, saying that there were only eight yuan in it. She said that the small number could be discussed with Shi tomorrow and showed the note written by Shi. She did not hear that there were 8,000 yuan in the package, etc. Detective Xu Bingnan also stated that he said those words to her at the time, and took her note, but she snatched the note twice, causing it to be torn. Judge Chuan thoroughly questioned her, and she insisted on her statement, saying that she was indeed fooled by Shi and begged for consideration. The court appointed a lawyer to defend her for free and ordered her to be sent back to custody to await a scheduled verdict. Qiu Xianrong was allowed to be released.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>The epidemic is rampant. Some time ago, I introduced the water disinfection method of bleaching powder to the Chinese people, but because some people still have some doubts about it, please publish the attached letter in your newspaper to dispel the doubts of the public. I am very grateful. Please accept the seal of Doctor Zhu Yanggao, the chief writer of the Shenbao Museum. Some people suspect that the drinking water disinfection method introduced by me using bleaching powder is poisonous, and some see that it cannot kill other animal insects in the water (such as mosquito larvae, commonly known as Dahanchong). It is not known that germs are plants, and the effect of bleaching powder is limited to germs, so it does not kill small animals, which is enough to show that it is harmless to animals, and even more harmless to humans. Therefore, I do not hesitate to repeat, please use it, check it, and I am willing to be responsible for the introduction, because the method is simple and effective, cheap and easy to obtain. Attached are a few points on bleaching powder disinfection and other prevention methods: (1) Water and drinking water disinfection: The water in all rivers contains a lot of epidemic bacteria. After it is drawn, it must be disinfected before it can be drunk. Disinfection method: Use half a copper coin's worth of bleaching powder, equal to 0.8 grams, or two and a half cents of the balance, and add it to four洋油箱 kerosene tanks, equal to 80 liters of river water. After 20 hours, all kinds of epidemic bacteria in the water will be killed. Then use this water to wash food utensils, such as bowls, chopsticks, and spoons, and use this water for washing face, gargling, bathing, etc., which can definitely avoid epidemics. It is important not to use the water in the river directly. (2) All food and all utensils for storing food must be covered with gauze to prevent mosquitoes and flies from flying in, because mosquitoes and flies are the media for epidemics. (3) Injecting preventive injections. (4) Do not eat water fruits. If you must eat them, no matter what kind of water fruit, soak them in boiling water for one minute to disinfect them. The above four items are the key points of epidemic prevention, which are easy to implement, and bleaching powder is very cheap, so it is easy for both the rich and the poor to buy and prepare, and the effect is great. I hope that those who live at home should pay attention to this and do not be afraid of trouble, and spread it widely, so that the epidemic can be prevented. I checked that on August 2nd, various newspapers published the matter of our association's inspection of the industry's unscrupulous merchants, which involved a section of the Xin Yongyuan store. I think it was a misprint, which caused the city's chamber of commerce to report a serious warning. I am very sorry and I would like to correct it in order to clarify the facts and avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. The Preparatory Committee of the Nanhuo Industry Trade Union. Direct letter: I recently read a news item (Ma Zezhao Hosted the Press Yesterday) in the local news column of the thirteenth edition of your newspaper on August 10th this year. In the (Kangzang War) section, the words (our army) and (our) in the telegram from Brigade Commander Yu were mistakenly arranged as (professional army). I hereby send this letter to ask you to check and correct it. Yours sincerely, Ma Zezhao, August 10.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Expulsion of Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Japan's exclusion of Chinese people is extremely harsh. First, it prohibits laborers from entering the country, then rejects peddlers and merchants, and recently, even students studying abroad are being expelled. In the past week, a student studying in Japan, Tian Xiangfan, was ordered to be deported by the Japanese authorities. Recently, Xu Yulin, a student from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, was prevented from landing in Yokohama, Japan, and was forced to board the Asama Maru and deported. This is a deserved retribution.</p>
<p>No matter who it is, if they have any conscience and a bit of humanity, they would not want to go to Zhabei or Hongkou, because the various cruel images left by the Japanese are vivid in people's minds and unpleasant to see. Moreover, regarding the situation in the Northeast, the Japanese have appointed Mutō as commander of the Kwantung Army to fully realize the plan for unified aggression, and the situation in Jehol is extremely serious. Originally, Chinese students studying in Japan, under these circumstances, unless they are completely heartless, should voluntarily return home. Now, there are still people going to study in Japan, which is truly deserving of the label of cold-blooded, country-humiliating youth. I can only curse a few times like a tram driver ("Pig!"), what else can I say?</p>
<p>However, according to a survey by a certain newspaper the other day, although the number of students going to Japan to study after the September 18th Incident has decreased slightly compared to before, there are still quite a few people going. I don't know what these people think when they step on the land of imperialists, and what face they have when they see imperialists. Mencius said, "What distinguishes humans from animals is only a little bit, and it is nothing more than a sense of shame." If people have no sense of shame, they are worse than animals. Even if these heartless students return home after completing their studies in the future, they will only be a few more Zhao Xinbos, etc., and what will they have to do with our country?</p>
<p>Someone might say, "Buddhists say, 'If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger cubs?' We only know the strength of Japan now, but we don't know why Japan is strong, so we must study in Japan to investigate its content in order to prepare for our future revenge." This saying is also a thank you. Since the late Qing Dynasty's reform, countless people have gone to study in Japan every year. Where is our country strong now? What is the method to deal with Japan? Now, (clutching at straws) it is even more out of the question.</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Study of Sound <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Fu</p>
<p>In the science section of this publication, most of the articles published are about chemical knowledge applied in industry, and there is little research on physics. Therefore, I specially contribute to you some common knowledge about sound in physics.</p>
<p>Sound (Sound), except for those whose hearing organs are damaged, everyone can hear it. It seems that there is nothing surprising, but let's ask how sound is made? How can we hear the sound? What is an echo? And what about all other questions? If you can't answer these, then please patiently read the following!</p>
<p>When the bell rings, we hear the sound. When it has just finished ringing, try to lightly touch the edge of the bell with your lips, and you will feel that the bell is vibrating very violently. Therefore, the success of sound is due to the vibration of objects, and this vibration force is transmitted layer by layer to the place where the sound is received - our ears. Of course, if the ears are covered, the sound will be reduced.</p>
<p>The transmission of sound depends entirely on the air that fills the earth and is everywhere. Now, let's take an experiment: put an alarm clock in a glass cover. At this time, you can clearly hear its ringing. Then, use an air pump to pump out the air in the cover to make it a vacuum, then you can't hear anything. Therefore, when talking on high mountains or airplanes, the sound is very weak, which is because the air is thin at high altitudes.</p>
<p>In addition to air, solids and liquids can also transmit sound, and they are better than air. Here are a few very common examples: stick your ear to the steel rail, and you can hear the sound of a train moving from a long distance. Lie your ear on the table and tap the table with your hand, and the sound will sound much louder than if you don't lie on the table. These are enough to prove that solids can transmit sound. People diving in the water can hear the sound of ships sailing and all kinds of objects hitting in the water from a long distance. This can also prove that liquids can transmit sound.</p>
<p>If there is an obstacle in front of the sound source, the sound will immediately bounce back, which will create an echo. If the distance is close, the echo and the original sound are mixed together, so there is no echo, but the original sound can be increased because of this. This is called reinforcement. Echoes are very detrimental to theaters or venues, because they can hinder and disrupt the audience's hearing. There are also ways to avoid echoes, just place more sound-absorbing materials, such as heavy felt curtains and silk cloth curtains. As for the speed of sound, it is probably slower than light. For example, when it thunders, you always see the lightning first, and then hear the thunder. When firing a cannon, you also see the light and smoke first, and then hear the sound of the cannon. The speed of light is about 138,000 feet per second (equivalent to 650 million Chinese feet), which is more than 5,000 times faster than sound. At 0 degrees Celsius and 76 meters of pressure, the speed of sound is 1,087 feet per second (331 meters). The increase in the speed of sound is directly proportional to the temperature. For every degree the temperature increases, the speed of sound increases by 2 feet. It can generally be remembered that at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), the speed of sound is 1,130 feet per second. From this, the distance of the sound source can also be inferred from the sound of the cannon, as long as the time elapsed from the light to the sound is multiplied by the speed of sound, and the result is the distance between the sound source and the sound receiver. During the European War, this method was used to calculate the distance and counterattack, but later smokeless gunpowder was used, which made it impossible for the enemy to speculate.</p>
<p>I have mentioned above that solids and liquids transmit sound faster than air. The speed of sound in solids is 15 times faster than in air, and in liquids it is 4.5 times faster. Doesn't it seem that there is nothing surprising about sound, but when you study it, don't you find it very wonderful?</p>

<h3 id="e209">Proposal to Improve Children's Clothing <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zu'e</p>
<p>We have already discussed the improvement of adult clothing several times in this association, but it is regrettable that we have not paid attention to children's clothing. I think that our country has always paid little attention to children's lives, and the improvement of clothing is particularly lacking. Following the old ways has a great impact on children's development, so I propose to improve children's clothing. I sincerely hope that comrades will contribute to this.</p>
<p>Looking at children's clothing in our country, there is no new design. They only follow the clothing of adults, so that a lively child is often restricted by clothing, which limits their innocence. For example, a boy wearing wide-sleeved robes and loose belts, this kind of dragging appearance is enough for the child to show a dull appearance, and he won't be lively. There are also girls who don't know anything about curves, but adults insist on making them tight-fitting cheongsams, thinking that they are showing the child's fashion, but they don't know that the child's body is being bound. There is also a hard high collar around the head and neck, which is no different from calling her to wear a yoke! So it will only create a gentle and refined child, which is not pitiful?</p>
<p>Originally, clothes are for protecting the body, for oneself and not for others. Only seeking to balance cold and warmth, cleanliness and hygiene is enough. Children don't have much perception, and there is no need to pursue sophistication or fashion at all. We should pay attention to the child's development or whether there are any obstacles. As far as I can see, I will briefly describe the standards of children's clothing as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lively and Unrestricted: Children have lively innocence, which has a great impact on development and thinking. Wearing adult clothing can limit their liveliness, which is a great drawback. Therefore, children's clothing should be improved to be lightweight and simple, not only should it not bind the body, but also increase their lively spirit through improved clothing.</p>
<p>(2) Simplicity: Simple clothing can cultivate a non-extravagant habit, and children need to jump and run, simple clothes are more durable than gorgeous ones.</p>
<p>(3) Domestic Clothing Materials: The inferior root of despising domestic goods and loving imported goods is very common among Chinese people. Some even deceive their children by making them wear foreign clothes or buying foreign toys because they are noisy, which makes the children plant these inferior roots. How sad! Therefore, children's clothing must strive for domestic products to cultivate a prejudice against not despising domestic goods.</p>
<p>(4) Saving Labor and Materials: Children's clothing must strive to save labor and materials, and the style should be simple. Some densely arranged buttons and other complicated tailoring not only waste clothing materials, but also take a lot of effort, and are inconvenient for children to wear.</p>
<p>(5) Heroic Clothing: Flattering clothing can indeed please people, but it is not as impressive as heroic clothing. In addition to the above improvement standards, the style of children's clothing should also have a heroic spirit. Wearing a small military uniform or a navy suit can give children a brave spirit, which may be helpful for the future of the nation.</p>
<p>These are just a few standards for improvement. Naturally, I have not exhausted all aspects of improvement, especially the implementation of how to improve, which I have not mentioned. I hope that those who are interested will discuss these issues.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>February 18</p>
<p>The maid, A Xiang, secretly told me while tidying my room, "The master has found someone for the young lady." A Xiang is a very clever girl. She knows about me and Y, so she secretly told me about it. I was very suspicious. These days, my mother has also been acting suspiciously towards me. Y's father has also met [my father], and he says he is a promising young man. I asked him to meet my father, but my mother always spoke for me. If my father didn't object at first, why has he changed his mind now? But I can't ask my mother, so I'll write to him to discuss it and then decide what to do.</p>
<p>February 19</p>
<p>Mother vaguely said to me that men must marry when they are old, and women must marry when they are old. I am an only daughter. Mother has loved me like the apple of her eye since I was a child, but a young girl in her adolescence has been occupied by another kind of "love." Since Mother didn't explain it clearly, I pretended to be busy with my schoolwork and pretended to study to deceive her back to her room. She still thinks I'm shy, doesn't she? Y, I deceived my mother for you!</p>
<p>February 20</p>
<p>He should have written today. A Xiang ran a dozen times and said there was no letter, but he often comes to me on Sundays. Is he avoiding suspicion because of this problem? Or did I write too seriously in my letter, and did something unexpected happen to him? If so... ah! I can't bear to think about it anymore.</p>
<p>February 21</p>
<p>When I went to school, I told A Xiang to pay attention to my letter and not let my mother hide it, but there was still no letter. I don't know what happened to him. I also have to take a chartered car in and out. The driver is my father's confidant, so I can't secretly go to see him. God! What should I do!</p>
<p>February 22</p>
<p>(Man) What a terrible name! I have been very careful in offering my precious virgin love to him because they are as brutal as tigers and wolves, but all crows under the sky are the same black. He, the hateful and poisonous heart, his usual feigned smile, is completely exposed in this letter, something about not having the ability to be independent: something about not having the freedom to love when economic support depends on others, something about wishing me a happy future... ah! Damned thief! Are you also like the Japanese, with no (human) smell after revealing your masks! Ah! ... (The following is incomplete)</p>
