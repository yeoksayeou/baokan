<h3 id="c1">如何肅清鴉片彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>關於鴉片之出產消費烟田　量等之數目字我國今尙無比較可靠之統計其原因蓋由於以鴉片爲財源之封建勢力。與運輸毒品之帝國主義者。都百方隠蔽其眞相。而軍閥官吏爲隹持其顔面一切都在半公開之形式下進行故其眞相隠而不彰但據去年主辦特稅之李鴻基之意見全國共分七生產區。一爲雲貴川。二爲陜甘三爲綏察四爲晋冀五爲東北六爲兩。廣七爲閩皖。共有十七省區爲產烟地至烟之產最據李氏估計。每年可產二萬萬兩。假設每畝地平均生產量爲五十兩。則全國種烟地共爲四百萬畝據拒毒會一九二○年之估計。烟民佔全國總人口百分之一·二依全國人口爲三萬萬七千萬計算則烟民當爲四百四十四萬人以之分配二萬萬兩烟土每人每日可得一錢二分五釐。實則據烟禍年鑑第四集所載。雲南一省之烟田數量。２己逹一百萬畝準此以推及全國十七省區。則四百萬畝之數目字。以及烟土產量烟民數量。實數尙不止此。總之。自鴉片流入我國百年以來。以軍閥官吏之勒種勒銷。及烟民之遣傳習俗之薰陶烟之產地。但有增多。絶無減少而烟民之數量。則更日益激增。鳩形鵠面之病夫幾徧全國毒流之廣而且深吾人但一閉目靜索能不爲之戰慄。</p>
<p>坐是之故。我國耕地農產日益减少。遊民病夫日益增多。而農村經濟崩潰之過程更日益加速。於是而農業無法改良農產逐年歉收豐歲旣己不能自給。凶歲則更餓莩載途近歲以來無歲不荒種種水旱風疫之自然災害都無法預防而去年大水突發。則尤以烟禍爲其大因。我國民日即於身亡家破之途。我民族日即於國亡種滅之途。尙怡然不自覺喪心病狂者且又從而藉公賣之名。以行奬勵吸種之實。此誠爲世界僅有可痛之怪現象。吾人誠不解持此主張者。究爲是何居心。</p>
<p>再就政治之觀點上而言。以鴉片之播種封建勢力在鴉片之貿易中。可以獲取優厚之利益。爲壟斷此利益爲爭奪此利益於是對於政治上之統一。爲絶大之障礙。即此二十年來連綿不斷之内戰亦爲一有力之根因蓋鴉片貿易。可以維持軍閥與土豪之勢力。可以激起烟稅之爭奪戰。而包攬此項特稅者。則尤不利於財政上與政治上之統一及交通之發展。其爲我國政治上之絶對反動力。蓋至爲明顯。鴉片一日之禁絶則我國民經濟。决一日無由興復。政治一日無由統一。民族一日無由進入健全之途。</p>
<p>雖然吾人今日反對公賣要亦爲一種治標之主而非爲治本之道如曰治本則問題之歸根仍不外乎消滅帝國主義者在華之政治與經濟勢力并推翻國内封建勢力。使農業得以改良。生產力得以增加。更統一政治與財政。集中資本於生產事業。實行建設减少軍額。裁减軍費。以减輕人民之擔負必如是而後勒種勒吸之政治壓力乃得以解除生計艱難不得不以販賣毒物自活之經濟壓力亦得以消滅鴉片之肅清夫然後庶幾有望若徒作文字上之宣傳口頭之呼籲終於事實毫無補盎。二十年來拒毒之聲不絶於耳。而毒流反日廣日深者無他不從根本着手不掊覆其根基。而徒作表面之呼籲勸告。其不能收效。固爲事所當然。然則吾人今日而欲言拒毒。究應從何着手。應亦知所以自擇矣。</p>

<p>軍部堅决反對政黨内閣</p>
<p>荒木鈴木意見仍難融洽</p>
<p>電通十九日東京電鈴木内相關於後繼内閣、今晨復派人與軍部方面折衝、軍部始終主張實現舉國一致内閣、反對政黨内閣、故縱令大命降於鈴木、鈴木於組閣之際、必遭遇暗礁、</p>
<p>路透十九日東京電據消息靈通方面聲稱、荒木與鈴木商得諒解之說、尙屬過早、聞軍部現仍力主大舉清除政黨弊惡、並救濟農民與小資本之商家、而鈴木則不肯擔任立即實施此種遠大之改革、故爭點似屬極關重要、軍部爲傳統的厭惡資產者、其將士皆募自鄉間、當然表同情於貧苦之農民、咸覺農民困於重稅、而工商界之巨子則資以爲利、故以爲今欲避免更惡劣之發展、則當掃除關於日本政黨制度之弊害、及改善農民之生活狀况、而政治家與軍部立塲不同、其權力多有賴於政黨獵官制、此與財閥有密切之關係、故自不能擔任過分之改革也、</p>
<p>遠東社十九日東京電日本組閣問題仍多波折、昨日下午四時鈴木與荒木會見後、一般人相信政友會與陸軍部意見己趨一致、但以現在情形觀察、鈴木與荒木兩人意見不但未作一致、且及趨對立之勢、故組閣問題、今明日尙難决定、鈴木派今日由政友會幹事長森恪向荒木數次奔走疏通但均無結果、昨日自鈴木與荒木會見後、一般相傳兩派意見業經一致、以是又引起軍部方面之驚愕、眞崎參謀次長今日親向荒木詢問與鈴木派妥協事實、而荒本絶對否認、并解釋昨日與鈴木之會見、係爲感情上之應酬而己、關於組閣與陸軍部所取之根本問題、尙未解决、</p>

<p>電通社十九日東京電西園寺雖己入京、然陸軍方面對後繼總理唯一候補者之鈴木内相、尙未完全諒解、加以各方面提出種種之希望與意見、照目下形勢、園公之奉答、恐非今晚或明晨所能簡單行之、蓋鈴木對軍部之關係、仍爲左右政局之癥结、</p>

<p>日美戰機切迫</p>
<p>（績）</p>
<p>自滿洲事變勃發以來、日美兩國之關係、原爲不幸危機胚胎之時期、今彼對於事勢之推移、先集中艦隊全部於太平洋之海面、繼以檀香山爲中心、舉行大演習、其野心之暴露、可爲明證、顧吾人迥憶從前無理强迫的外交手段、所謂「支配廣漠之世界、」對於某特定之國家、欲逹到自國之野心、或暗示自國之敵意、不辭輕動全國陸海軍、以威嚇對手國、此在歐洲外交史上、所謂由權謀機詐時代醖釀至大戰勃發時代、其旗幟鮮明以軍國主義相標榜之德俄兩國、與比較及收自由空氣的英法、何以國交上發生紛糾、良以對手國之眼中、動輙以刀槍相臨故也、一九一○年九月、德皇行幸於温那市廳、屢以併合波士尼亞州問題、威嚇俄國、當時歐羅巴大受外交上無理要求之感觸、與言語之恫嚇、頓起不安、</p>
<p>今美國政府雖非步武歐羅巴之後塵、然回溯羅斯福總統時代、在德皇行幸温那市前二年、提督史威利率領艦隊進迫橫濱、當時亦以武力與儀禮混合的示威運動、恫嚇日本、自歐洲大戰以還、過去的國際觀念、本己消滅、威爾遜大總統、復以和平指導者自任、進而提唱縮減軍備、生張消滅戰爭、不圖今日美國矛盾其旨、竟再採用無理强迫外交的信條、無故移動全國艦隊、激成日美兩國國民之好戰慾其輕舉妄動、誠使吾人不解之至、大凡有品位之大國家、應持守其大國家之態度、檀香山之大演習、不啻在日本人大門之前、表演其不穏的攘臂挑戰行爲、其踰越常軌、不言而喻、今美國海軍、必欲在太平洋中心之檀香山舉行演習、其中果有如何意義、吾人就現在日美關係言之、己可危懼、其尤足慮者、今後美國海軍之行動、恐更將踰出常軌、亦未可知、蓋大演習後應歸還大西洋之偵探艦隊、突然變更預定計畫、無期限的滯留於太平洋上、由四圍之情勢觀之、更可證明美國政府之意圖、在太平洋上着着準備戰爭、際此危機、不論其個人與全體、若稍失其自制力、即可釀成不可收拾之危局、蓋彼在檀香山舉行大演習本己犯吾人之忌、倘其偵察艦隊永久滯留於太平洋上、一旦不愼、勢必發生無限的風波、此余所以爲日美兩國前途憂也、（未完）</p>

<p>長安城郭全國第二長安爲歷史盛地。周·秦·唐·諸朝均建都於此。城郭之堅偉。除北平外。當推第一。城高十餘丈。闊數丈。可容雙車並駕。故丙寅之役。陜軍賴資八月堅守。城内最大建築。當推鐘鼓二樓。雕樑畫棟。高聳雲端。蓋昔日帝王家晨鐘暮皷之遺跡也。今皷聲己不可聞。鐘則猶按時啓用。鐘聲宏亮。全城可聞。▲四山環抱風景秀麗長安城依平原而築。終南環抱。風景殊幽。最著者有「華嶽仙掌」「太白積雪」。「曲江流飲」。「雁塔晨鐘」「灞柳風雪」「草堂烟霧」。「驪山晚照」。「咸陽古渡」。諸盛景。明代人且有長安八景諸。至今每當春秋佳日。士女猶多依詩作探景之南針焉。</p>
<p>古蹟豐富民俗堅强長安城中。古蹟儲藏頗豐。如「古物陳列所」。「民衆圖書館」。「碑林」等。内多金石史典。希世奇珍。然此猶係供衆觀覽者。其經私家收藏者。爲數亦夥。地方風俗儉樸。但極忌侮辱。故民間有「不怕狼。不怕狗。但怕辱」之語。憶昔年康有爲赴陜。長安市上舉行盛大之歡迎會。但不久康氏即以欺寺僧之經。爲歡迎者所逐。戴季陶嘗謂陜人穴居野處。應與加以蟲旁。此語陜人己微聞之。此次戴氏赴陜。長安市民爲報蟲旁之辱。旣毆其人。復燬其車。此亦添都聲中之一趣聞也。</p>

<p>松江婦人松江婦人是有着厚而紫的兩片嘴唇，眼睛正和金魚的一般·坐在伊身旁的是伊的兒子，約摸總十一二歲的模樣，大槪是因爲遺傳的關係，他的眼和嘴唇恰巧和他的母親一樣。火車開過了龍華，車窗震動的聲音是格外響，火車好似負了傷的野獸似的·沿着生銹的車軌向那初夏綠色的田野裏突進，這時，車上的查票員開始檢票了。松江婦人大槪是因爲眼睛和金魚一樣的凸在外邊，所以比人家先瞥見，於是連忙呌伊兒子睡在自家的背後，把自己的衣裳蓋没兒子的脚。查票員來了，松江婦人摸出一張車票給他剪了一個缺。火車到了松江，那婦人和伊的兒子一溜烟地跳下了車。</p>
<p>瘋女車子停在嘉興，那時兩個鄉人抱上一個少女，少女的臉上有着兩塊桃色的紅雲，這是表示伊還有青春的美點，可是伊的手是被人用繩縛着。兩個男子抱伊上了車，就把伊當猪仔一樣的丢在凳上，那少女也就馴服地被摔倒了。車身開動的時候，那少女便純眞地唱着小曲·舞着手，一時車上的乘客們都圍到伊的身旁，譏笑着伊，可是伊依然是唱着舞着。據看管伊的鄉人說··伊是爲她母親的死亡哭成了這個樣子。</p>
<p>一塲糾紛憲兵找着一個穿軍裝的人，問他從那兒來？那穿軍裝的人便從口袋裏摸一封信，信上是證明他是請長假的，信上打着××團部的印子。憲兵看了一下信，接着便嚴勵地說××「你己經請了假，你就變成了老百姓，軍裝不准穿，趕快脫下來。」</p>
<p>「同志，六個月没有關餉了，你呌我不穿軍裝穿什麽？」</p>
<p>「我問你穿什麽呢？反正你己經不能」</p>
<p>穿軍裝。」憲兵的語氣益發變硬了。</p>
<p>「軍裝是我自己做的，我没有衣裳就要穿它，什麽地方我都跟你去。」</p>
<p>這時兩方面的情形簡直有點惡化了，好在杭州快到，憲兵就說··「現在不和你辯，咱們有話下車說。」</p>

<p>大來氏四十年前。購一雙桅帆船。名曰「賣報童子NewsBoy。此即大來航業」</p>
<p>發軔之始也。以此區區小舟。日居月諸。遂成今日太平洋上握航業牛耳之大來航綫焉。大來初到遠東。在一千九百零一年。翌年復來。嗣後船數日增。其最盛時期爲一千九百十五年至一千九百三十年間十五載。今猶蒸蒸日上。方興未艾也。大來今己八十八歲矣。其一生所歷之最足爲氏驚異者。莫如近代科學上之種種發明。氏常謂在四十年以前。彼如欲與某一船之船主通訉。必須俟該船駛入一通海電之港埠後始可。今則不然。彼能隨時用無線電發出號令。而於翌晨得其復電焉。彼又常謂事人生於現代之世界。有無線電。電話。汽車。飛機等等。如在吾初購雙桅帆船時。語我以此種種。吾將不假思索。逕目之爲狂人矣。大來氏又好述愛迪生第一次發明電燈事。彼初於報紙中聞其事。絶不信其可能。且認爲欺人之談。擲報於字籭中。繼思愛迪生或不欺其老友。乃致函於愛氏。謂報章所傳苟非虛假者。請先寄吾數枚。吾將懸之於木廠中。以覘其異焉。乃愛氏之所答。有出乎大來意料之外者。愛氏謂苟欲燃此燈。必先以鐵線支諸其地之四週。而通以電流。然後始可放光云云。大來聞之。爲之捧腹絶倒。然亦究不知其所以然之故也。大來曾自作傳略。初僅欲以之赠送親友。繼思一生事業成功之所經。或有補於後來之青年。乃决以公諸世焉。大來氏自記云。「余生平自貧賤。以至今日。皆」</p>
<p>刻苦而來。凡人應各自卑而漸升。不　等。不越級。其基礎自固。余自問人間少年所受之艱苦。未有甚於余幼年之所歷者。願天下少年聞之而起奮鬥之心。勿以小故而自挫其壯「云。大來因不」</p>
<p>忘其幼年困頓之狀。特於一日。鼓輪至蘇格蘭福吉克之故鄉。歸語人曰。「吾欲覓吾幼時之故居。然己無覓處。其地己成巨埠。木廠林立。余人覘之。則見塊塊木板上。均鐫余名焉。「」鳴呼大來。偉矣。凡偉人皆不知其事業之偉。獨僞偉人始自命爲偉也。</p>

<p>民國比較滿清，進化，民十以後比較民十以前·進化，這話不但我國人承認，即幾位「嘰哩哥嚕」的洋先生，恐也承認，</p>
<p>但我回過頭來想想，進化在那裏？幾位出洋過的洋博士，丨或者不須出洋，祗要一入高中，或方跨進了大學堂的門丨自上所穿的，便非舶來品的洋裝不可，家裏所用的，若一踏進貴族化的大戸人家，室中布置得光怪陸離的，無非舶來品居多，</p>
<p>即如此次戰事，敵人飛機大砲兵艦坦克車，無一不備，我們？僅有幾枝新式的機關槍步槍等等，亦是出錢從别國購買得來，試問我國進化在那裏？</p>
<p>有了！進化了！確實進化了！跳舞忙，看影戲忙，社交公開忙，男女同浴忙，自由結婚與自由離婚忙，尤其是摩登女郎，奇裝異服，變化百出，以及其他一切一切，統統多向時代潮流而進化了，</p>

<p>青蓮打印水</p>
<p>蒸溜水十二分甘油（Glycerin）四分酒精（Atcohol）三分醋酸（Aceticacid）數十滴以上四種原先和合，用筷調匀，再加極純清的青蓮粉一分調和即成，可藏於玻璃瓶内，惟最須注意者，以上所用藥品，愈純潔做出來愈好，醋酸與青蓮粉，更須選購佳品，</p>
<p>薄荷錠</p>
<p>樟腦（Camphor）五英兩薄荷腦半英兩一同置於粗料碗内在火上熱之，少待，二物溶化混合，再倒於模型内壓之成形，比市上所售的薄荷錠功效更佳，因薄荷腦在此方内己用得稍多，西洋各國製藥廠製薄荷錠，大槪用此方，但我國市上，滿充日貨，銷流甚廣，良以他售價低廉，然他用薄荷腦不多，因此原料甚貴，故日本貨究竟不好，</p>
<p>膠水</p>
<p>黃明膠（中國藥店有售，價便宜，銅元一枚可購一根）一百分水一百分酒精四十分酸醋十分明礬（純潔）一分先以黃明膠與水置於碗内，隔水燉溶，調之使混合，然後再加其他各物即成，</p>

<p>前天本刋上有「大學生的程度」一篇，内有「某某大學轉學生的幾件答案」。說得好像很眞，但某大學招考揷班生，决不會出「土肥原是什麽？「也不會問什麽宋子文，蔡元培的，所以我想這位作者，未免有些「滑稽性質」，講到現在的大學生，平日不肯用功的確是很多，看電影，談戀愛，上跳舞塲，的確是不少，所以昨天，我們十八同學開會，我乘此機會，出十個測騐題目，作爲餘興，請他們冩在紙上答出來，在二十分鐘内，卷子都交齊，他們冩得很清爽，又非常的詳細，並且也很有趣，現在我改選抄下來，介紹給讀者。</p>
<p>一何謂五大戲院？</p>
<p>答南京，新光，國泰，卡爾登，光陸。</p>
<p>二何謂三大公園？</p>
<p>答兆豐公園，虹口公園，法國公園。</p>
<p>三密斯×失戀的起因。</p>
<p>答其最大之原因，蓋她的情人早己另有所愛，其起因爲民國二十年八月四日，密斯×在校園内散步，在吃花生米，適遇着×君，不肯給他吃幾粒。於是二人即大相其罵·當時，另有一對在旁，努力與之勸和，但他倆心中未免留有痕矣。至十二月十七日適逢星期日，下午七時十三分，二人乘汽車至××跳舞塲，至十二時三十五分，×君樂極發狂，手臂誤觸玻璃杯，咖啡茶流出來皆在密斯×皮大衣，絲襪‘皮鞋上，乃二人在舞塲内又大相其駡，從此×君與另一的她相愛，密斯×亦從此失戀矣。</p>
<p>四現任某女校皇后是誰？</p>
<p>答×××女士。（十八人完全一律對）·</p>
<p>五××跳舞塲的地址？</p>
<p>答×××路，一千六百五十二號·（十二人完全對，四人號數冩不出，二人祇冩對路名），</p>
<p>六大學生住在校外的目的？</p>
<p>答（一）自由，住在校外夜間旣無可恨的舍監來禁止我們高聲的唱歌，日裏又無其他同學來擾亂我倆綿綿的情話。（二）利便，在校外暑天可用電風扇，冬日租裝電火爐，並可用電茶壺等，不像校内要裝亦無法。（三）安靜，獨坐冩情書，窗外無同學來窺看，旣可放心冩，又不致冩錯，每月可省信紙數百張，校内决無如此安靜。</p>
<p>七何謂戀愛主義？</p>
<p>答戀愛主義是救我們大學生悶煩的唯一良藥，更須於最短時間，促其實現。</p>
<p>答戀愛主義，就是救我主義。（七人這樣冩。）</p>
<p>八何謂五經？</p>
<p>答愛經，吃經，聖經，衣經，情經。（十八人皆對。）</p>
<p>九琴尼蓋諾是何人？</p>

<p>十棄婦是什麽？</p>
<p>是有聲電影的片名，瑙瑪希拉主演的：很好看，這張片子我看過六遍。</p>
<p>十八份卷子，都答得很好，皆可打上九十分到一百分，可知大學受這類常識測騐，没一個不能Passo</p>

<p>— 芳</p>
<p>星期下午，余訪同學×女士，叙談的時候，經她想起了一樁事情，現在把牠冩在下面，</p>
<p>她對我說，「芳姊姊，我的表姊，在去年經姑母給她嫁了一位敎育部的××君，他們愛情的熱度，可說是逹於沸點了，時常的人家稱做一對美滿的夫妻，自從九一八發生，××君對我的表姊說，一現在國家鬧到這樣地位，政府又抱不抵抗的主義，把豪富的東三省，不費一毫的力量；就送給人家了，唉，國家如此，還有甚麽希望呢？</p>
<p>我的表姊說，「你不要在此長吁短嘆吧，國家最後的希望，責任就是青年們擔的，那麽，人人也像你一樣的，不從實力上去做，國家怎麽不亡呢？」</p>
<p>××君說，「我所以不到前綫服務，爲國家，民族，犧牲，就是忘不却你和一個美滿的家庭，」我的表姊說，「大丈夫志在四方，甚麽可以留戀着一個女子和一個家庭，就把責任缷了，」他們的一腔熱烈的說話，好像還在我的腦筋中，</p>
<p>不幸一二八戰事又發生，××君剛在北京研究他的事情，我的表姊事前也不聽着眞確的消息，所以未有搬到租界上去，這夜，她在温暖甜蜜的夢裏，被無情的槍砲驚醒了，慌忙的和鄰家李奶奶逃走到一處荒僻的地方，經了許多的道途，和戰雲的恐怖，這時就和李奶奶走散了，後來不知她爲砲火所葬，抑爲敵兵所殺，都不可知，</p>
<p>事後我把李奶奶的說話，通知××君，那知他聽了這個消息，一些也不悲痛，我當時心腔裏佈滿了疑雲，試想，他們的愛情，逹到這樣熱庶，怎麽現在一點兒也不悲痛呢？後來曉得他自去北京後，就認識一位女朋友，天天出入，跳舞塲啊，影戲院啊，大菜館啊，等等的快樂場所，那裏還記得從前的妻子呢？</p>
<p>唉，現在社會·是這樣黑暗的，我們女性，若不謹愼，就會跌落深坑去的，戀愛啊，結婚啊，都是欺騙女性的，好像魚兒，貪了小小的餌，就上了釣鈎，這時，懺悔也趕不及的，女性們呀！快快從光明的路上去吧，</p>
<p>你</p>
<h3 id="c226">民樣文章 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 耐厂</p>
<p>讀了佛君的「官樣文章」想起了研究「民樣文章」。官民分治的時代，各有各的文章。</p>
<p>八股文的遺毒到如今還存在。，「天禍中國外侮頻興……」一類的口吻，委員們，秘書們都誦得爛熟，出手成章。國内祇要稍有點變動，這類口吻便大出風頭，通電呀，宣言呀，眞如聨珠地發出，鬧得不亦樂乎丨</p>
<p>最令人發噱而不解的事，就是没錢打電報居然倡出所謂時髦的，快郵代電，也大出其風頭。</p>
<p>這是受了官化的民樣文章。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>打倒囗囗囗</p>
<p>各界聨合起來囗囗囗囗囗囗</p>
<p>擁護囗囗囗囗囗</p>
<p>這些都是我們中華民國朋友們熟悉的活用公式，乳臭未乾的黃毛小兒也會掉弄筆頭填上一個打倒囗囗囗的公式。　　冩着「天皇皇地皇皇我家有個小兒郎……」一類的紙條兒常在街頭巷尾出現。這些大槪都是打倒囗囗囗等公式的結把兄弟，可以修身齊家。</p>
<p>新派的青年所見者大，喜歡治國平天下的文章，舊派的老年所見者小，喜歡修身齊家的文章。總之，都是民樣文章。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>「心思弗定，起課算命」眞是天經地義。</p>
<p>王三的差使不曾運動的成功，李四的病没有起色，趙五想討小老婆，都是囗囗居士和囗囗道人頂高興的機會，也是和尙廟裏黃臉婆子喜笑顔開的原因。</p>
<p>「鴻運○歲，查清扣足欠……天</p>
<p>「○○流年○○主事……」</p>
<p>「第○○支靈籖。上中，中下，上上大吉。」</p>
<p>這類套頭在中國社會上佔着極木的勢力，也是民樣文章之一。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>「難民○○歲，一家五口，自戰區倉皇逃出……」</p>
<p>愛多亞路一帶常可以看見如此如此的難民。粉筆在地面冩了成篇刻板文章，無非是「孤苦伶仃……」無以餬口……老少五口全靠大善士扶助……」等等。某甲如此說，某乙也如此說。我很不解何以戰區逃出的難民都是五口之家。不會四口。也不會六口。</p>
<p>此之所謂民樣文章之四</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>王季緒絶食救國，張學文憂國自盡，我黃帝子孫眞能犧牲，殉國的事常見。</p>
<p>「國難當前不忍偷生………願同胞一致起而救國」都是憂國自殺殉難者遺書中的片段。</p>
<p>市政府没有經費，發薪水打折頭，原因是「國難當前」。某甲和某乙失戀情死，遺書說「國難當前」。甚至老夫婦吵嘴，氣死了一口，也可以說「國難當前」</p>
<p>這也是民樣文章之一。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>「親愛的妹妹……」好不肉麻丨</p>
<p>你要有福氣當郵務檢查員，定可以整日看鑡這些豔麗肉麻的文字。大槪陳部長主張增加郵資，這也是不言而喻的原因之一。</p>
<p>大學生在課堂上冩「親愛的……」是唯一的職務。中學生在厠所中讀「親愛的……」是惟一的消遣。</p>
<p>這是民樣文章之六。</p>

<p>（一）舞女和倒糞夫</p>
<p>上海是一刻不停地旋轉着，各式各樣的人，在各式各樣的環境中掙扎着生存，牠的表面的繁華，在初至黃浦江畔的遊客，不能透視牠背景後的咒咀，飲泣，舞女和倒糞夫，在絶不相同的上海環境中求生存，前者結束上海之夜，後者開始上海之晨，「上海生活」中我特别以他們開端，亦表示上海是一刻不停地旋轉着之意。</p>
<p>慘綠色的燈光下，舞女在人們戀態心理之下旋轉，她們賣弄風騷的媚眼；顫動的臀部，……滿足每次出四毛錢代價的舞客，而舞客的戀態心理，更以香檳酒丨換句話說，金錢的誘惑，逹到更進一步的目的，以血肉之軀，沉浸於酒精，性慾的生活裏以求生存，每天清晨纔結束她們上一天的生活，得到安息，當她們像妖魔一樣從大建築物裏吐出來的時候，倒糞夫也以他們的勞力來開始一天的生活，他們没有好的營養，適當的睡眠，每天從像猪窩一樣的家裏出來勞作，再將疲乏的身體搬進猪窩裏去。　　舞女，倒糞夫丨以及一切的人類，都在旋轉的上海生活中掙扎生存。</p>
<p>（二）編輯先生</p>
<p>編輯先生吳進踏進的冩字間，望着檯上堆着的信件，先擠着眉摇了摇頭，茶房很殷勤的送上一客蛋炒飯，他填飽了肚子，燃着烟捲，很免强的把稿子發了，預備早些歸家，（他的妻子生着病），而排字房裏的小伙計跑來說，還少十幾行稿子，翻翻來的稿件，都不能適用，就靜坐下來搜索枯腸，因爲一心顧着家中的妻子，不知所云的冩了幾行補白，望望時鐘十二句，還少幾分鐘了黃包車在荒凉的路上拉過，可以清晣的看見車夫的脚底打着柏油路的聲音，突然背後來了一陣急促的聲音，吳進</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>不免一驚，以爲「剝猪　」的先生光臨了，免强鎭靜着，原來也是一輛黃包車從背後追來，車上坐着頭髮像剌蝟的舞女，吳進先生暗暗好笑。</p>
<p>走進臥室，望見妻的慘的臉，嘴唇翕張着，好像說爲何回來得遲，提起熱水瓶，空空如也，午夜歸來求一杯温茶而不得，吳進先生就冩他的日記「……這勞苦的編輯飯，明日起决意辭職」，并且冩好了一件辭職的信。</p>
<p>明天像今天一樣的來了，吳進先生也一樣的進他冩字間。</p>

<p>「阿要長錠！賣長錠！」一個鄉村裝束的婦人，在夜幕籠罩着的各弄各里呌喚着，</p>
<p>一家家的黑漆大門，立刻開啓，東也呌買，西也喊來，你十個銅子，他八個銅子，不多一回兒，一串串的紙錠都賣完了，婦人囊着豐富的收穫，帶着勝利的笑容，盈盈地去了，</p>
<p>一家家買了長錠，都立刻把牠在門外付之一炬，紙灰飛舞，翩翩若蝴蝶，紙蝶飛盡了，各人家的大門也隨着嘭的一聲合上了，</p>
<p>大家說，每月朔望燒這麻兩次，可以得上天保佑，消災降福，而所費又祗是幾個銅子，眞是大便宜事，而賣長錠者，也就寄生在他們這種心理中了，</p>
<p>聽到長錠聲，便可知道己到了朔和望了，知道己到了人們久己淡忘的廢曆之朔望了，所以這賣長錠者是廢曆的報告者，是廢曆的擁護者，而上海人迷信之程度，也可見一斑了，</p>

<h3 id="e1">How to Eradicate Opium <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the production, consumption, acreage of opium fields, and the like, our country still lacks reliable statistics. The reason for this is that feudal forces using opium as a source of wealth and imperialists transporting narcotics are doing everything possible to conceal the truth. Military warlords and officials, to maintain appearances, are conducting everything in a semi-public manner, so the truth remains hidden. However, according to Li Hongji, who was in charge of the special tax last year, the country is divided into seven production areas: 1. Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan; 2. Shaanxi and Gansu; 3. Suiyuan and Chahar; 4. Shanxi and Hebei; 5. Northeast; 6. Guangdong and Guangxi; 7. Fujian and Anhui. There are a total of seventeen provinces and regions producing opium. As for opium production, according to Mr. Li's estimate, it is 200 million taels per year. Assuming the average production per acre is 50 taels, the total opium-growing land in the country is 4 million acres. According to the Anti-Opium Association's estimate in 1920, opium addicts account for 1.2% of the total population. Based on a national population of 370 million, there should be 4.44 million opium addicts. Distributing 200 million taels of opium to them, each person would get 1 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li per day. In reality, according to the fourth volume of the Opium Evil Yearbook, the acreage of opium fields in Yunnan Province alone has reached 1 million acres. Based on this to extrapolate to the seventeen provinces and regions, the number of 4 million acres, as well as the amount of opium production and the number of opium addicts, are actually more than these figures. In short, since opium flowed into our country a century ago, with the forced cultivation and sale by military warlords and officials, and the influence of hereditary customs of opium addicts, the production areas of opium have only increased and never decreased, while the number of opium addicts has increased even more dramatically. Sickly people with emaciated appearances are almost everywhere in the country. The spread of the poison is so wide and deep that we cannot help but shudder at the thought of it when we close our eyes and think quietly.</p>
<p>Because of this, the arable land and agricultural production of our country are decreasing day by day, while the number of vagrants and sick people is increasing day by day, and the process of rural economic collapse is accelerating day by day. As a result, agriculture cannot be improved, and agricultural production decreases year by year. Good harvests are no longer able to meet our own needs, while bad harvests cause starvation everywhere. In recent years, there has been no year without famine. All kinds of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and epidemics cannot be prevented. Last year's sudden major flood was largely due to the opium scourge. Our people are heading towards death and family ruin, and our nation is heading towards national subjugation and annihilation of the race. Yet, some people are still unaware of this and are so insane that they are even promoting addiction and cultivation under the guise of public sales. This is truly a rare and painful phenomenon in the world. We really do not understand what intentions those who hold this view have.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from a political point of view, through the planting of opium, feudal forces can obtain significant benefits from the opium trade. In order to monopolize these benefits and compete for these benefits, they pose a great obstacle to political unity. The continuous civil wars of the past twenty years are also a powerful cause of this. The opium trade can maintain the power of military warlords and local tyrants, and can incite battles for opium tax. Those who monopolize this special tax are particularly detrimental to fiscal and political unity and the development of transportation. Its role as an absolute reactionary force in our country's politics is very obvious. If opium is not eradicated for a single day, our national economy will not be able to recover for a single day, our politics will not be able to be unified for a single day, and our nation will not be able to embark on a healthy path for a single day.</p>
<p>Although we oppose public sales today, it is only a temporary solution and not a fundamental one. If we talk about a fundamental solution, the crux of the problem is still nothing more than eliminating the political and economic power of the imperialists in China and overthrowing the domestic feudal forces. This will allow agriculture to be improved, productivity to be increased, and politics and finance to be unified. It also means concentrating capital in productive enterprises, implementing construction, reducing military personnel, and cutting military spending to reduce the burden on the people. Only in this way can the political pressure of forced cultivation and addiction be relieved, and the economic pressure of having to sell narcotics to make a living can be eliminated. Only then can the eradication of opium be hoped for. If we merely engage in written propaganda and verbal appeals, ultimately there will be no improvement in reality. For the past twenty years, the call to reject opium has never ceased, but the flow of drugs has become wider and deeper. This is because we have not addressed the problem from the root and have not overturned its foundation. We have merely made superficial appeals and admonitions, and it is only natural that they have not been effective. So, if we want to talk about rejecting opium today, where should we start? We should know how to choose for ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Jiangwan Takeover Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Leaving the United Society Before 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the personnel sent by the Takeover Committee to take over Jiangwan and Pengpu first gathered at the United Society on Avenue Haig. They included Dai Hongen, chief of the fifth section of the fifth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Liang Fuchu and Li Shengkou, special commissioners of the Takeover Committee, Ma Chonggan, Zhou Shang, Wei Shinan, Zhang Yanggao, Zhong Shijie, Li Haihong, Zhang Maoyan, and Wang Wujun of the Education Bureau, and many others. At 9:11 AM, they took cars and left, passing through North Sichuan Road and Jiangwan Road, and arrived at the gate of Jiangwan Labor University at 9:50 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Both Parties Negotiate <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Jiangwan, our personnel split into two groups. One group, consisting of Education Bureau personnel Zhang Yanggao, Zhong Shijie, and Zhou Shang, took small cars to Jiangwan Town to inspect several elementary schools such as Jianke, Taowan, Zhongshan, Qiujiang, and Maicun. Ma Chonggan inspected various universities and middle schools. On the other hand, Dai Hongen led Liang Fuchu, Li Shengjun, and others to the headquarters of the Japanese garrison of the Second Academy of the Cultural Institute on Wenhua Road to negotiate with Japanese Commander Major Akazawa. Akazawa took out the succession document (i.e., the handover document) and gave it to Mr. Dai to read. Both parties agreed.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Handover Situation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM, Wen Yingxing of our side of the Joint Committee, accompanied by British representative Sanghair, American representative Tralad, Pabostar, the representative of French representative Ponnavida, Italian representative Fallatini, and Lieutenant Su Le, the entourage of Tralad, also arrived by car to meet with the Japanese representative. Thus, the handover ceremony was held. A table was placed in the courtyard outside the Cultural Institute site, with three copies of the succession document placed on it. One was given to our side, one to the Japanese side, and one to the representative of the neutral country. After a brief discussion between the two sides, they signed the document. Japanese garrison commander Major Akazawa gave a speech saying that the armistice agreement had been signed and the Japanese army was withdrawing in accordance with the agreement, hoping to maintain the friendship between the neighboring countries of East Asia in the future. At 11:20 AM, they drank champagne and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Succession Document <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The succession document after the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Jiangwan was originally in Japanese, and the translation is as follows: "The commander of the Jiangwan Town Japanese Army garrison will hand over the land, buildings, and all security used by the Japanese army (in the western district of the railway) in Jiangwan Town to the Special Police of the Republic of China at 11:05 AM on May 19, Showa 7 (1932), and will bear the responsibility for the protection and security of the people thereafter. Hereafter, please confirm that the Special Police of the Republic of China have completely protected and guarded the land and buildings used by the Japanese army in Jiangwan Town (western district of the railway) at 11:05 AM on May 19, the 21st year of the Republic of China, and confirm that all inheritances have been received. After the Jiangwan Town garrison commander has received everything, the protection and security mentioned above shall not be his responsibility. May 19, Showa 7, Akazawa Rokuzo, commander of the Jiangwan Japanese Army garrison. May 19, the 21st year of the Republic of China, Dai Hongen, chief of the fifth section of the fifth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau."</p>

<p>Due to the heavy damage, the tap water pipes have not yet been repaired. Yesterday morning, the Telephone Bureau and the Telegraph Bureau sent personnel to survey so as to restore them in the shortest possible time. Yesterday, the Zhabei Chinese Business Public Bus Company sent technicians to inspect the roads in order to resume operation.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Inspection Situation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Takeover Committee Chairman Yin Rugeng and Han Dequan, together with Special Commissioners Tao Xiaojie and Liang Fuchu, went to Jiangwan to inspect the situation after the takeover. They arrived at 2:30 PM and inspected for a week, and Section Chief Dai Hongen of the Fifth District of the Town led them to inspect the area most affected by the disaster in the town. The universities, agencies, shops, and civilian houses that were bombed by airplanes and set on fire accounted for 80 to 90 percent. Waterways, electric lights, and telephone lines were also destroyed. Chairman Yin instructed Section Chief Dai to plan and repair as soon as possible to benefit the people's livelihood. The factories and photography studios along the Sports Association Road were also completely destroyed. Two diesel locomotives were parked in front of Jiangwan Station, and the station building was also bombed. After our police took over yesterday morning, they immediately set up posts and completed the deployment. The local security can be worry-free in the future. The Defense Corps is also starting to recover. On the verge of leaving, Chairman Yin Rugeng and Committee Member Han instructed Director Dai to pay special attention to defense and hygiene matters in the future, and to solve the problems of food, fuel, and housing for the people as soon as possible. Committee Members Guo and Zhu were unable to go to inspect due to other important matters.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Japanese Military Exercise <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM this morning, the Japanese army east of the Jiangwan Town Railway held a treasure bomb exercise and filmed a sound movie. Fearing that our side would misunderstand, they notified our Section Chief Dai in advance yesterday when the takeover was taking place.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Japanese Army Has Retreated from Miaohang <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army in Miaohang had already withdrawn. They did not notify our side in advance, causing the area's security to be in extreme danger. Fortunately, our side learned of this, and the Takeover Committee for the Withdrawal Area ordered Liu Guiting, chief of the Second Branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, Zhu Huang, commander of the Third Company of the Capital Security Team, and Lu Fengpu, chief of the Second District of Baoshan, to go to take over immediately. They arrived there yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Pengpu Takeover Situation <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Pengpu Town is located south of Dachang. Usually, there are no more than 100 Japanese soldiers stationed there. Therefore, the Japanese army did not report to the Joint Committee when it withdrew at the beginning of this month, and informed our side to take over. Therefore, in recent days, the town and nearby villages have been repeatedly looted by bandits. Municipal Councilor Ling Zhibin of the district therefore reported the situation to Chairman Yin of the Shanghai Withdrawal Area Takeover Committee and requested early defense. He obtained the permission of the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai before taking over yesterday morning at 9:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Defense Situation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th, the Takeover Committee sent Municipal Councilor Ling Zhibin of the district to meet with Dai Hongen, chief of the Fifth Section of the Fifth District, the Jiangwan Receiver, holding a handwritten letter from Bian, the commander of the First Brigade of the Capital Security Team, to Dachang to contact for the dispatch of police matters. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Municipal Councilor Ling Zhibin, together with Liu, a patrol officer from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and more than 30 police officers from a squad of the Capital Security Team, walked to Pengpu Town from Dachang. Since the Japanese soldiers had already left the town, there were no handover procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Joint Defense Meeting <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>After the defense was taken over, at 11:00 AM, Zhou Bulian, Wang Chaodong, Zhao Wenxiu, Zhang Zhongxiang, and others from the Pengpu District Defense Corps and the Municipal Office were invited to jointly discuss the joint defense method in five items: (1) Traffic is prohibited after 8:00 PM to prevent bandits from mixing in. (2) Police patrols are assisted by the Defense Corps to guide the way and increase police force. (3) Before the Zhabei part is taken over, it is impossible to receive the Municipal Public Security Bureau's password, so it is planned to self-compile and apply it. (4) The police district originally belonged to the fourth district. Now, since the southern part has not been taken over and traffic is blocked, public security matters will be temporarily jointly led by the fifth section of the fifth district, and the Defense Corps will assist. (5) Assist the Municipal Public Security Bureau in investigating household registration.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Start Office <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Office and the Defense Corps in the district moved to Shanghai to work. It has been two months since the takeover. Now that the defense has been taken over, all the agencies have been reorganized and restored immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Traffic is Still Blocked <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Although the town has been taken over, the Japanese army between Zhenru Town and the railway north of Zhabei District to Zhongshan Road has not yet withdrawn, so it is still inconvenient to travel between Shanghai and Pengpu. It is heard that Zhenru Town and a part of Zhabei will be taken over by our side at 3:00 PM on the 23rd. After that, the travel between Shanghai and Pengpu will be unimpeded.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Report from the Joint Committee Management Committee <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Joint Committee Notice Regarding the Japanese Army's Withdrawal and the Handover of Each District, yesterday, Joint Committee members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing of our side notified the Takeover Committee in the Withdrawal Area and reported everything. The content is divided into four points: (1) The Japanese army in Jiangwan withdrew at 11:05 AM yesterday morning. When the takeover took place, Dai Hongen, chief of the fifth section of the fifth district of our side, led the Chinese police to take over. Military officers from various countries of the Joint Committee went to monitor. The withdrawal location of the Japanese army was west of the Songhu Railway. (2) Taking over Jiangwan before taking over Zhabei places our police force in a very dangerous situation of being surrounded on all sides. Regarding this matter, the members of our side of the Joint Committee have sent a letter to the Japanese members and notified Mr. Ke Ninghan, Chairman of the Joint Committee, to pay attention. (3) The Japanese army in Pengpu suddenly withdrew, and the date seemed to be on or before the 18th. At that time, our side was not notified, resulting in no one being responsible for public security, and the harassment of villains was unbearable. Today, our police force has gone to take over. (4) Today, the Japanese army stationed in Miaohang northwest of Jiangwan withdrew suddenly without notifying our side. Our side learned of this later and sent the police to take over.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Management Committee Bulletin <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee issued a bulletin yesterday, stating: (1) Send Zhu Huang, commander of the Third Company of the Capital Security Team, to lead 20 police officers to Miaohang immediately, and cooperate with Liu Guiting, chief of the Second Branch of the Baoshan Public Security Bureau, and Lu Fengpu, chief of the Second District, to handle the takeover matters. (2) According to the report of Wu Shaolin, chief of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau, the situation in the takeover area is as follows: (1) The local situation is peaceful as usual. (2) Wuzhen Road Bridge is fully open today. (3) Order Bian Zhishan, commander of the Capital Security Team, and Pan Zhongjia, magistrate of Jiading County, to transfer troops to Nanxiang to properly protect the long-distance telephone lines, so as to prevent good people from cutting them. (4) Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Takeover Committee Chairman Yin Rugeng and Committee Member Han Deqin, accompanied by Special Commissioners Tao Xiaojie and Liang Fuchu, went to Jiangwan to inspect the takeover situation. The car arrived in Jiangwan at 2:30 PM and inspected for a week, and Section Chief Dai Hongen of the Fifth District of the town led them to inspect the area most affected by the disaster in the town. The universities, agencies, shops, and civilian houses that were bombed by airplanes and set on fire accounted for 80 to 90 percent. Waterways, electric lights, and telephone lines were also destroyed. Chairman Yin instructed Director Dai to plan and repair as soon as possible to benefit the people's livelihood. The factories and photography studios along the Sports Association Road were also completely destroyed. Two diesel locomotives were parked in front of Jiangwan Station, and the station building was also bombed. After our police took over this morning, they immediately set up posts and completed the deployment. The local security can be worry-free. The Defense Corps is also starting to recover. On the verge of leaving, Chairman Yin Rugeng and Committee Member Han instructed Director Dai to pay special attention to defense and hygiene matters in the future, and to solve the problems of food, fuel, and housing for the people as soon as possible. Committee Members Guo and Zhu were unable to go to inspect due to other important matters.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Returning Captured Soldiers and Civilians <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese military authorities previously notified the Joint Committee and requested to find and return the remains of Japanese soldiers left in the Taicang County area. Our side ordered the Taicang County Magistrate to find them, and they were transported to Shanghai and returned to the Japanese side a few days ago. However, our side had previously agreed with the Japanese authorities that our captured soldiers and civilians must be returned on a regular basis. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities decided a few days ago to return our captured soldiers and civilians at the North Railway Station at 10:00 AM yesterday. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, our side of the Takeover Committee ordered Special Commissioners Lu Shaoji and Cha Nanqiang to go with Shen Yi, secretary of the Rear Office of the 19th Route Army. They arrived at the North Station at about 10:00 AM. Tomita Naomitsu, a staff officer of the Japanese side, had already arrived there. Our 39 captured soldiers and civilians were also escorted to the place. After our three gentlemen, Lu, Cha, and Shen, arrived, the Japanese staff officer Tomita handed them over one by one and gave the list of captured people to our side for verification. After our side signed the list, they led the captured people back to the Rear Office of the 19th Route Army. Among the 39 captured soldiers and civilians, six belonged to the Fifth Army, one of whom was seriously ill, ten belonged to the 19th Route Army, and 23 were all civilians who were innocently arrested by the Japanese army.</p>

<h3 id="e32">No Troops Stationed in Southern Wusong <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Association Resolves to Question Luo Wengan</p>
<p>Results of Dispatching Personnel to Inspect Longhua</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association, based on newspaper reports that the Longhua Garrison Headquarters had stationed Chinese soldiers, dispatched Yang Youren, an executive member of the Association, to Longhua the day before yesterday to inspect whether there were any troops stationed there. After the executive member reported to the Board of Directors, the Standing Board of Directors held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the report. They found that the Garrison Department did not have any soldiers stationed there, and considered this situation proof that the so-called "no troops stationed in Southern Wusong" had evidently become a reality. They then resolved to issue a circular telegram in opposition and to question Foreign Minister Luo Wengan. The report of the executive member on the situation in Longhua is recorded below: Report: Having been dispatched to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters to observe whether there were any formal Chinese troops stationed there, I drove to the gate of the Headquarters at 10:00 a.m. on May 19th. The two guards at the gate were wearing cloth military uniforms and holding rifles, but were members of the 2nd squad of the factory guard of the Ordnance Factory. Entering the gate to the Garrison Headquarters office, there were two police officers from the 2nd company of the Municipal Public Security Police Brigade standing guard at the entrance, holding Mauser pistols. I was introduced by Mr. Li Cishan and presented my and Mr. Wu Gao's, the Secretary of the Headquarters, name cards, which were handed to a messenger wearing a plain, evergreen [missing character] serge uniform. I also wrote a visitor's slip (the visitor's slip book stated "Twenty-first year of the Republic, May, one book, total of five sheets used"). The messenger took the card inside. I remained waiting in the messenger's room. Shortly afterwards, the messenger came out and said, "Secretary Xie is not in. It is uncertain when he will come. You can come back another day when he is here." His tone seemed evasive. I then presented the card of the All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association and stated that I had been dispatched to investigate the troop stationing situation. If Secretary Xie was not in, could I ask the Adjutant to meet with me? Today's newspapers had a statement from Adjutant Chen Letian of the Headquarters. If this was true, I might as well ask to see Adjutant Chen." The messenger actually said, "Newspaper reports are not reliable. Although there is an Adjutant Chen at the Headquarters, there is no one named Letian." I further inquired whether the troops currently stationed in the department were officers of the Public Security Bureau Police Brigade, and he replied, "Yes, I suppose so." He also said, "The Commander has not come to the department to work and it is uncertain when he will come." After repeated questioning by myself, the messenger ran out of arguments and excuses, and even if I continued to press him, he would not give a responsible reply. I then asked his surname. He said, "Kang." I was uncertain if that was his surname. I then left the Garrison Headquarters. Outside the gate, there was the Garrison Headquarters telephone. Two soldiers in gray cloth uniforms were sitting on the steps at the entrance. There was one officer of the Public Security Bureau Police Brigade with the number 4206, and one named Zhu from the Ordnance Factory Guard. According to the person named Zhu, besides the Police Brigade and the Guard, there were no other troops. I hereby submit the above report on the results of my observation to the Standing Board of Directors, Yang Youren.</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau Sent Police to the North Station Yesterday</p>
<p>To Guard Railway Property</p>
<p>Chen Xinghan, the director of both the Jin-Hu (Shanghai-Nanjing) and Hu-Hang-Yong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railway Bureaus, due to a recent band of petty thieves who, taking advantage of the Japanese army not yet withdrawing from Zhenru and Zhabei, were secretly dismantling and selling railway property, specially went to the Reception Committee the day before yesterday and, together with a liaison officer from the committee, personally went to the Japanese consulate and the Japanese barracks to negotiate with Military Officer Harada and Major General Zhimatsu. Before the Japanese army withdraws, the Railway Bureau will send police to guard all railway property in advance. This was agreed to, and it was decided to first send twelve railway police officers to patrol around the North Station in shifts. Therefore, after 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 19th), the twelve railway police officers guarding the railway property had entered the North Station.</p>
<p>The British Association Publicly</p>
<h3 id="e33">Advocates Convening a Round Table Conference <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Foreigners Conspire to Plan Against Us</p>
<p>Ever since the idea of convening a round table conference emerged, the foreign community in Shanghai has been actively engaged, each eager to realize their long-held ambitions. The recent letter from the Shanghai British Association to various foreign chambers of commerce on the 14th provides a glimpse into their conspiracy. The translation of the letter is provided below, in the hope that our countrymen will make plans early and not regret their inaction later.</p>
<p>On the 13th of this month, the Board of Directors of our Association resolved: (1) To request your association to endorse the following resolution, which has been distributed to various foreign chambers of commerce in Shanghai. After obtaining unanimous endorsement, it will be forwarded to your government through the usual diplomatic channels. (2) To convene a special meeting of foreign taxpayers to propose the following resolution: "In view of the recent events in Shanghai, the Feetham Report, and in order to implement the resolution passed by the Council of the League of Nations on February 19th, the Shanghai Municipal Council is hereby instructed to urge the convening of an international conference to ensure the security of Shanghai, resolve the future status of Shanghai, and address other issues that frequently cause conflict and danger, with direct representation from the Shanghai Municipal Council attending the conference." Your association is hereby requested to endorse this resolution. Our Board of Directors also wishes to point out to you that unless concrete and effective action is taken at this time, all the problems that existed before January 28th will reappear in the future. These problems are: (1) the issue of extraterritorial roads; (2) Chinese armed forces around Shanghai; (3) the handling of litigation by the Special District Court. Regarding the first problem, your association is certainly aware from the newspapers that the Chinese have already strongly opposed the Municipal Council's road construction. These roads are all the property of the Municipal Council, as your association is well aware. Regarding the second problem, the stationing of unnecessary armed forces around Shanghai is extremely dangerous and could at any time lead to a repeat of the serious situation of 1927, necessitating the deployment of a large number of foreign troops to protect the concessions. Regarding the third issue, the Special District Court's improper handling of civil cases and lack of impartiality are obvious. Foreign merchants are well aware that even if they win a case, there is no agency to enforce it, so few seek relief from the court. This is also known to all foreigners. For these reasons, our Board of Directors believes that all foreign organizations should express their opinions to their governments, emphasizing the necessity of convening a round table conference, so that the world's major powers can resolve this and other issues. A copy of the resolution is attached. Please promptly endorse it, sign it, and return it. After all the foreign chambers of commerce have signed it, the resolution will be submitted for transmission to your government." The letter is signed by Huthai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Association.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Attached Resolution as Follows: <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Whereas there are several incidents that affect the happiness and good government of Shanghai and are the cause of recent conflicts and disputes, especially the Special District Court, the right to manage extraterritorial roads, and the presence of armed troops in and around Shanghai, this Board of Directors believes that unless the aforementioned outstanding issues are resolved simultaneously, the recent Sino-Japanese dispute in Shanghai cannot be permanently and satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, the Board of Directors resolves that the consuls and diplomatic representatives of our country should apply for a round table conference to be convened as soon as possible by the major powers and China to resolve the outstanding issues affecting the happiness and good government of Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council may also send representatives to attend the conference.</p>
<p>(Note) The above resolution was read by the President of the Council of the League of Nations. It is claimed that the governments of the United States, Britain, and other relevant countries have endorsed the proposal. The full text is as follows: (1) A conference composed of representatives of the Chinese and Japanese governments, together with representatives of the other major powers mentioned above, should be organized immediately in Shanghai, with a view to bringing about a final end to the fighting and restoring peaceful conditions in Shanghai. (2) The basis of the conference should be: (a) on the part of Japan, the absence of any political or territorial designs and of any intention to establish a Japanese settlement in Shanghai or otherwise to advance the exclusive interests of the Japanese; (b) on the part of China, an undertaking to make effective provision for the maintenance of the safety and integrity of the International Settlement and the French Concession, and to prevent these areas and the people residing therein from being exposed to danger. (3) The meeting of the conference must, of course, be conditional on the conclusion of a local truce. The Council is confident that a truce can be arranged at an early date, and it suggests that the military, naval, and civil representatives of the other powers in Shanghai should give every assistance in bringing it about. (4) This proposal is designed to secure the immediate restoration of peace in the Shanghai area and does not prejudice or restrict the position of the League of Nations or any of the powers in regard to any of the issues raised by the Sino-Japanese dispute before the League.</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations overseas news released by the League of Nations Information Office, the Japanese government subsequently accepted this resolution. The Chinese government replied that, in accordance with the principles already announced, if a ceasefire is accepted and implemented, the Chinese government is prepared to participate in the Shanghai conference and acknowledges that the peace of the International Settlement and the French Concession is necessary for the maintenance of security in Shanghai and its surrounding areas. However, the conference is limited to restoring security in Shanghai, and all issues arising from the Sino-Japanese dispute in any part of China should be resolved in accordance with the procedures invoked by China at the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Xu Xiangzhu, a victim of the language barrier</p>
<p>Xu Xiangsheng, a resident of Wenchang Road in Wusong, was walking alone to the corner of Hefeng Road at about 8:30 the night before last when he was suddenly stopped and inspected by Japanese patrol military police in the darkness. Because Xu could not understand the language, he turned around and ran away. The Japanese soldier immediately fired a shot, which struck Xu in a vital spot, causing him to fall to the ground and die. Xu's mother rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and wept over his body. However, Wusong is still under the trampling of iron hooves, and there is no way to appeal for justice. Yesterday, they could only hastily arrange for his burial.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Japanese Troops Withdraw Sequentially <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The various units of the 35th Regiment of the 17th Brigade Infantry of the Japanese 9th Division, stationed in the Jiangwan area, have already withdrawn yesterday and concentrated in Wusong and Yangshupu, preparing to depart for home. A squad of military police also left Shanghai at the same time. Since yesterday, military supplies and ammunition have been transported to the docks. The Army Ministry has also sent the transport ships Nōwei Maru and Kōchi Maru to Shanghai, berthed at Wusong and Dalian Wharf, scheduled to carry the troops back to Japan tomorrow. The Japanese troops withdrawing from Jiangwan, the various infantry and artillery units that have moved to the east of the railway, are scheduled to hold a drill at the Jiangwan Stadium at 9:00 a.m. today, stipulating that the infantry and cavalry units practice the military actions of attacking and raiding. These Japanese troops are also scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 21st. Previously, because many naval and army personnel were traveling between Japan and Shanghai, the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department specially formed a ticket inspection committee to exclusively check the tickets of the soldiers traveling by ship, in order to calculate the discount and payment with the shipping companies. Now, because all the Japanese troops are withdrawing, there is no need to retain this ticket inspection work, and it is being terminated. After remaining for another ten days, it will be abolished.</p>

<p>Self-Defense Army only five li from Harbin. The Songpu Power Plant was destroyed by artillery fire. Overseas Chinese donated aircraft also participated in the war. Longjiang Arsenal moved to Heihe. (Nanjing) According to reliable sources, Ma Zhanshan's anti-Japanese military actions are proceeding very smoothly. The Japanese army has been repeatedly embarrassed. Ma now has several aircraft donated by overseas Chinese participating in the war. The Longjiang Arsenal has moved to Heihe. It is rumored that Ma recently purchased a considerable amount of military equipment, which remains to be verified. However, Ma did obtain military equipment from the Japanese side before his revolt. Ma's troops number approximately 40,000, consisting of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, as well as a squadron of aircraft and twenty field guns. It is said that Ma's troops are well-equipped and disciplined, and are supported by local militias and volunteer forces, with numbers steadily increasing. (Reuter, 19th)</p>

Warehouses and houses along the Huhuai Line have also been largely destroyed by bombing. It is reported that many civilians have been killed or injured, but the exact number is unknown.

<p>Liu Zhiyan and Zhou Bocheng Decide to Resign</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Liu Zhiyan and Zhou Bocheng of the Guangdong Air Force sent a telegraph on the 18th, addressed to all newspaper offices and organizations for their public assessment: "The Air Force is a national defense force. This sudden merger by the First Army Group of Guangdong is, in reason and law, right or wrong. It is obvious to all and requires no further elaboration. However, Chen Jitang telegraphed to Beijing, claiming that the Air Force internally 'urgently requests to be taken back for reorganization,' and that if it is not taken back, they will resign en masse and go elsewhere. Matters of personal integrity make it impossible to remain silent. Looking back, our Air Force has gone through the sacrifices of countless martyrs, and the guidance of Commander-in-Chief Zhang for more than ten years, establishing a glorious history. Through difficult management, it has been able to stand alone, transforming personal military force into the force of the people, with the principle of not participating in civil wars. Therefore, resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists have proceeded in separate ways. In total, our Air Force has five squadrons. At the beginning of the Shanghai battle, Squadron Leader Ding Ji-xu of our Second Squadron led his planes north. Recently, when the Communist bandits invaded Guangdong, Zhiyan led the Fifth Squadron to Shantou, and Bocheng led the Third Squadron to Shaozhou, all to suppress the Communists. Furthermore, Commander Hu Jin-ya of our Second Group went far to America. The incident occurred suddenly, and Zhiyan and Bocheng's squadrons were not informed beforehand and were monitored afterward. The so-called 'urgent request to be taken back for reorganization' must be that one or two people blinded by profit are willing to once again turn the people's military force into a personal military force, to fulfill their private ambitions of seizing power. This not only betrays the enthusiasm of the people who have supported the Air Force for months but also destroys the glorious history of our Air Force for more than ten years. Zhiyan and others have their own principles of conduct, and they are determined to leave, firm in their conviction. Now, as private citizens, we do not wish to comment too much, but the facts are there, and righteousness resides in the masses. At this time of national crisis, they are still seizing power and grasping for personal gain. How can they face the people of our country? We must sincerely and openly express our feelings. Since things have come to this, what more can be said? Our original intention of resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists has not been forgotten for a single day. We dare to make this statement, hoping for your understanding and consideration. Liu Zhiyan, Zhou Bocheng, and others respectfully salute." (19th Special Telegram)</p>

He said that the boycott of Japanese goods is the result, and the Liaoning Incident is the cause. To correct the result, one must first correct the cause. Arima did not mention political issues.

<p>Eleven Resolutions</p>
<p>Telegram to the Investigation Team Opposing the Northeast Puppet Organization</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Eight national railway workers' unions held a joint meeting on the 19th, and the resolutions are as follows: (1) Telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Team opposing the Northeast puppet organization. (2) The Beining Railway Workers' Union is responsible for investigating unemployed workers and casualties in the Northeast, reporting to the Central Government and forwarding to the Ministry of Railways for condolences and preferential employment. (3) Telegram to the Central Government requesting the speedy recovery of lost territory in the Northeast by force. (4) During the national crisis, each railway workers' union should cooperate with the railway administration to supervise and lead the employees of each railway to work hard, increase production, and increase income. (5) Telegram to the Central Government requesting the Ministry of Railways to order all railway administrations to stop transporting Japanese goods and to order all railway workers not to purchase Japanese goods. (6) Petition to the Central Government to provide relief to disaster victims in the war zones and Communist bandit areas. (7) Petition to the Central Government to transfer to the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to each railway to cooperate with the union to investigate and dismiss redundant personnel and to determine the number of staff members according to the business conditions of each railway to avoid abuse. (8) If any railway workers' union finds a private sale of railway cars, it will report to the Central Government for strict handling. (9) Appeal to the Central Government during the national crisis to strictly order civil and military officials throughout the country to work hard to save the country. (10) Appeal to the Central Government to transfer to the Ministry of Railways to pay close attention to the purchase of materials on each railway to avoid malpractices. (11) Appeal to the Central Government to transfer to the Ministry of Railways to unify the treatment of workers and staff on national railways. In addition, the joint transportation tickets received by employees and family members serving in national railways should be free of charge. The telegram to the League of Nations is as follows: "Nanjing International Labor Organization China Branch transfers to the Geneva League of Nations Secretariat and the Northeast League of Nations Investigation Team for public review. The Japanese Empire violated the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, and at the expense of destroying world peace, suddenly occupied our Northeast with troops on September 18, 1931, expelled our officials, violated our sovereignty, and killed our compatriots, disregarding the resolutions of the League of Nations. It has created a Northeast puppet organization to deceive the world and attempt to fulfill its aggressive ambitions. The Chinese nation can never recognize it. Looking at the resistance to the puppet organization everywhere in the Northeast, it has no popular support and no autonomy. It is only the Japanese Empire that uses force to support the situation and calls it a country. Who can believe it? Moreover, the Northeast is our territory, and Japan has forcibly occupied it by force. This association is determined to lead the railway workers of the whole country as the government's backing, deny all puppet organizations in the Northeast, and hope to uphold justice, clarify justice, and promptly withdraw Japanese troops and return our Northeast to maintain peace. Fortunately in East Asia, fortunately in the world. The joint conference of the National Railway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China bows." (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Majority Opinion of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has discussed the amnesty case more than a dozen times. The majority opinion is that corrupt officials and Communist Party members should not be generally pardoned. For general criminals who should be pardoned, the following should be studied in advance: (1) The reasons for the crime (2) The behavior in prison (3) Livelihood skills after pardon. For military offenders, it seems appropriate to use military regulations, but the National Government promulgated the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law only half a year ago. Military offenders before the promulgation of this criminal law must be based on past military criminal laws. Therefore, this court is now consulting the Army and Navy Departments to send past military regulations to the court for reference. (18th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Five Million Reserve Soldiers Mobilized for Exercises Nationwide Aviation Personnel Ordered to Participate Berlin Closely Watching the Development of the Far East Situation</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th National News Agency, Today's announcement here is that Soviet Russia will hold a major exercise for the Red Guards and local security forces. The government has telegraphed all members of the National Popular Aviation Association to prepare to report to various airfields on the specified date so that all aviators can participate in the exercises. The purpose of the Popular Aviation Association is to democratize aviation and air defense, with 8 million members. Its most important function is to train junior aviators who have just passed the aviation test so that they can pursue further studies.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th National News Agency, Today's Forward Newspaper of the German Social Democratic Party stated that the Far East situation is showing increasingly tense signs. According to the radio news released by the Soviet Russian authorities in Berlin, Stalin originally planned to go to the Crimean resorts to enjoy the long summer, but he suddenly decided to cancel it because he expected a sudden development of the situation. Also, the People's Commissar of the Army, Voroshilov, was scheduled to speak on the radio last night, but the Moscow radio station suddenly announced temporarily that Voroshilov had been summoned to an important meeting and canceled the speech. In addition, there is an important sign of tense situation. The Moscow Supreme Military Commission has decided to convene reserve servicemen of the 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912 grades to participate in this year's major exercises or join local security forces or join the Red Guards, and no excuses are allowed. The newspaper believes that the aforementioned news can cause great fear, and the decision to mobilize reserve soldiers will cause 4 to 5 million people to arm and drill, which can be called a terrible military demonstration. It is still remembered that on May 1, the Moscow Labor Day parade had 100,000 defense troops with the latest weapons marching through Red Square, plus 300 aircraft circling the sky. If compared with this, it can also be seen that the Russians are eagerly preparing for military expansion.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th Reuters, Germany is deeply aware of the potential crisis in the current situation in the Far East, so it is closely watching its development. People from all walks of life are afraid that after the military controls Japanese policy, it will eventually lead to a conflict between China and Russia against Japan, which will affect the world. Everyone agrees that if the Japanese government succumbs to the demands of the military and intends to occupy Manchuria, it will inevitably lead to armed resistance from China and Russia. The general opinion is that Soviet Russia has exhausted political and diplomatic methods to contain this war. Although the German political circles are also afraid that the current situation will result in international disputes, they still hope that Japanese peacemakers can prevent the military's fanatics from engaging in adventures with unpredictable consequences.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Suzuki Cabinet Formation Faces Many Obstacles <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Military Firmly Opposes a Political Party Cabinet</p>
<p>Araki and Suzuki Still Find Their Opinions Difficult to Reconcile</p>
<p>Dentsu, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: Regarding the successor to the Suzuki cabinet, a person was again dispatched this morning to negotiate with the military. The military consistently insists on realizing a national unity cabinet and opposes a political party cabinet. Therefore, even if the imperial mandate descends upon Suzuki, Suzuki will inevitably encounter obstacles when forming the cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: According to well-informed sources, the claim that Araki and Suzuki have reached an understanding is premature. It is said that the military is still strongly advocating a large-scale elimination of the evils of political parties and the relief of farmers and small business owners. However, Suzuki is unwilling to undertake such far-reaching reforms immediately. Therefore, the point of contention seems extremely important. The military traditionally detests the bourgeoisie. Its soldiers are recruited from rural areas and naturally sympathize with impoverished farmers. They feel that farmers are burdened by heavy taxes, while the giants of industry and commerce profit from them. Therefore, they believe that to avoid further deterioration, the evils of the Japanese party system must be eradicated, and the living conditions of farmers must be improved. Politicians and the military have different positions. Their power largely depends on the political party spoils system, which is closely related to the financial cliques. Therefore, they cannot undertake excessive reforms.</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese cabinet formation problem still faces many twists and turns. After Suzuki met with Araki at 4 p.m. yesterday, the general public believed that the opinions of the Seiyukai and the Army Ministry had become consistent. However, based on the current situation, not only have Suzuki and Araki not reached a consensus, but their opinions are also trending towards opposition. Therefore, the cabinet formation issue will be difficult to decide today or tomorrow. Suzuki sent Morikaku, the Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, to run errands and mediate with Araki several times today, but to no avail. After Suzuki met with Araki yesterday, it was widely rumored that the opinions of the two factions had become consistent, which surprised the military. Chief of Staff Mazaki personally inquired with Araki today about the fact that he had compromised with the Suzuki faction, but Araki absolutely denied it and explained that yesterday's meeting with Suzuki was merely a social courtesy. The fundamental issues regarding the cabinet formation and the position taken by the Army Ministry have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: It is said that young Japanese army officers are extremely indignant that Minister of the Army Araki will compromise with Prime Minister Suzuki and have begun a movement against a political party cabinet. Upon hearing the news, veterans in various regions are extremely excited and have sent representatives to the capital to cooperate with the young officers. Youth groups have also sent representatives to the capital to join the fascist movement, and the momentum is very strong.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: Saionji arrived at Tokyo Station at 4:57 p.m. today. Security was extremely tight along the way. At 5:07 p.m., he arrived at his residence in Surugadai and immediately met with Suzuki, the Imperial Grand Chamberlain, who had been waiting for him. Suzuki first stated the Emperor's intentions and then held talks on the political situation for thirty minutes. Saionji, in view of the importance of the political situation, will first listen to the opinions of senior statesmen and the wishes of the military before replying to the Emperor. He must also consult with various parties on financial issues before entering the Imperial Palace tomorrow to personally report on the successor cabinet. Finance Minister Takahashi will meet with Saionji tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. to report on the current state of finance and the economy and to present the Seiyukai's future policy direction. Therefore, Saionji's recommendation for a successor cabinet is highly regarded by all parties. However, the military's attitude is strong, and a portion of the government is still advocating for a Hiranuma cabinet. Therefore, it is still questionable whether the successor cabinet will be the Suzuki cabinet.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: Although Saionji has entered Tokyo, the military has not yet fully understood Prime Minister Suzuki, the sole candidate for the successor Prime Minister. In addition, various parties have put forward various hopes and opinions. Given the current situation, Saionji's reply may not be simple to make tonight or tomorrow morning. Suzuki's relationship with the military is still the crux of the political situation.</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Elder Statesman Saionji arrived in Tokyo at 4:50 p.m. today. Military security was strict along the way. When the car passed in front of Nihon University from Tokyo Station, a strange young man tried to submit a petition to Saionji and advanced towards the car, but was arrested by Japanese police. When the car stopped at Tokyo Station, another young man threw a leaflet into the window of Saionji's car. The main point of the text was to oppose political party politics and the formation of a fascist cabinet.</p>

<p>Far East News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: A few hours before the thugs attempted to assassinate Inukai Tsuyoshi on the 15th, a special corps organized by farmers in Kashiwazaki Prefecture planned to attack and bomb the Tokyo Electric Power Plant, causing a great terror of darkness throughout Tokyo. However, the police suddenly discovered it, and several people were arrested at that time, while the rest fled far away. Today, several farmers who plotted to bomb the power plant at that time were arrested again in Osaka and have been handed over to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for questioning.</p>

<p>U.S. Congressman Proposes...</p>
<p>Reconstructing a Military Dictatorship Government</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, 19th, Hawaii Dispatch: The Japanese have already created a strong influence in Hawaii. U.S. Representative Blanton proposed in the House of Representatives that Hawaii is an important place in the Pacific and that methods should be found to reduce the influence of the Japanese in the area to prevent Japan from using it to control the Pacific militarily in the event of a Japanese-American war.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, 18th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Congressman Blanton, a leader of the pro-Navy faction in Congress, introduced a bill in the House of Representatives today to create a military dictatorship government in Honolulu and to grant the governor appointed by the Army or Navy Department the full power to veto resolutions of the Honolulu Legislative Assembly. Blanton claimed that the recent McVeigh honor killing case in Honolulu has exposed the legal situation in the area. The investigation of the case shows that local political concepts have greatly hindered the enforcement of laws and the maintenance of order in recent years. For such an important territory as Honolulu, no other country besides the United States would allow its political affairs to be completely controlled by the natives as it is today. It is said that there is already strong opposition to this in Honolulu.</p>

<p>Negotiating Disarmament with Those Whose Profession is Warfare Cannot Be Expected to Genuinely Agree</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, 18th, Geneva Dispatch: British chief representative Cecil stated here today that the lack of progress in the disarmament conference is hardly satisfactory. When reporters called on him, Cecil frankly stated that the disarmament conference has drifted into a sea of mysteries with no hope. The continued negotiations of army and navy experts are meaningless. These people's profession is warfare, so they cannot be expected to agree to genuine disarmament. The purpose of this conference is not war, nor is it to discuss how to defeat the enemy, but to reduce the danger of war. How can those whose profession is warfare negotiate?</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, 18th, Geneva Dispatch: Today, the Aviation Committee of the Disarmament Conference rejected Germany's motion to abolish all military aircraft by a vote of 22 to 7. Only six countries - China, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria - supported Germany's proposal. The debate was very intense. The Little Entente even proposed that all commercial aircraft be classified as offensive weapons.</p>

<p>Kokumin News Agency, 18th, Geneva Dispatch: Poland's representative to the League of Nations criticized Count Gravina, the Italian administrator of the Free City of Danzig appointed by the League of Nations. It is claimed that the official is implementing anti-Polish policies in the Free City and that the alarming rumors recently published in several major British newspapers that Poland will implement arbitrary policies in Danzig were also issued by the official. The Council held an informal meeting today to discuss Poland's letter. The Polish representative insisted that all the points he made were supported by evidence. After heated debate, a resolution was passed rejecting Poland's letter, stating that the letter was not suitable for public discussion, and reaffirming its trust in Count Gravina.</p>

<p>Reuters, 19th, Bombay Dispatch: After a day and a half of peace in this city, serious riots have resumed. In today's riots, a total of six people died and thirty were injured. Members of the two religions fought fiercely throughout the day. The cause was that Muslims were traveling in the mill area, where most of the residents are Hindus. The mill workers gathered and beat the Muslims, killing one person on the spot. As a result, 44 mills were shut down. Fifty mill workers have been arrested. Police were forced to fire on the rioters once in the morning.</p>

<p>For Causing the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Also Dissatisfied with the League of Nations' Actions on Manchuria</p>
<p>Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that British representative Cecil, who attended the League of Nations Special Committee for the Iberian issue, made a statement to Geneva reporters on the Sino-Japanese issue after the League of Nations Council meeting on the 9th, saying, "Japan caused a major incident in Shanghai, which developed into various tragic tragedies that are difficult to describe in words. The British government's attitude was not strong enough towards Japan, which I regret. Although a ceasefire agreement has been reached, this is only a special ceasefire. There is an even more important Manchurian problem in front of the League of Nations that has not been addressed. I believe that what the Council has done in the past is a warm-up act. The League of Nations should seriously deal with Manchuria in the future, and the current situation in Manchuria cannot be considered satisfactory from any perspective. In short, my impression of Japan, just from the Shanghai incident, is that Japan's actions were reckless, which is rare in recent years and the most violent and foolish." (Japanese people criticized Cecil's remarks as malicious.)</p>

<p>A Japanese-American War is Imminent</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the relationship between Japan and the United States has been an unfortunate breeding ground for crises. Now, they are concentrating their entire fleet on the Pacific Ocean and holding large-scale exercises centered on Honolulu, which is clear evidence of their ambition. However, we recall the unreasonable and coercive diplomatic means of the past, the so-called "domination of the vast world." For a specific country, to achieve its own ambition or imply its own hostility, it does not hesitate to lightly mobilize the entire army and navy to threaten the opposing country. In European diplomatic history, the two countries of Germany and Russia, which clearly advocated militarism, moved from the era of power and deceit to the era of the outbreak of war. Compared to the United Kingdom and France, which received free air, why did disputes arise in their relations? Because the opposing country always faced them with swords and guns. In September 1910, the German Emperor visited the Vienna City Hall and repeatedly threatened Russia with the annexation of Bosnia. At that time, Europe was greatly affected by the unreasonable demands and verbal threats of diplomacy and felt uneasy.</p>
<p>Although the current U.S. government is not following in the footsteps of Europe, President Roosevelt led a fleet to pressure Yokohama two years before the German Emperor's visit to Vienna, threatening Japan with a demonstration of force and etiquette. Since the Great War in Europe, the international concepts of the past have disappeared. President Wilson, as a leader of peace, advocated disarmament and the elimination of war. Unexpectedly, today the United States is contradicting its purpose, adopting the unreasonable and coercive diplomatic creed again, and mobilizing its entire fleet for no reason, provoking the warlike desires of the people of both Japan and the United States. Its rash actions are truly puzzling to us. Generally, a great country with dignity should maintain its attitude as a great country. The large-scale exercise in Honolulu is nothing less than performing an uneasy and challenging behavior in front of the Japanese people's door. Its transgressions are self-evident. Now, the U.S. Navy insists on holding exercises in Honolulu, the center of the Pacific. What is the meaning of this? Judging from the current Japan-U.S. relations, we can already be fearful. What is particularly concerning is that the actions of the U.S. Navy in the future may exceed the norm. The reconnaissance fleet, which should have returned to the Atlantic after the large-scale exercise, suddenly changed its scheduled plan and stayed in the Pacific indefinitely. Judging from the surrounding situation, it can be further proven that the U.S. government's intention is to prepare for war in the Pacific step by step. At this crisis, if either the individual or the whole loses its self-control slightly, it can lead to an irreparable crisis. The large-scale exercise they are holding in Honolulu is already offending us. If their reconnaissance fleet remains in the Pacific permanently, if they are not careful, endless storms will inevitably occur. This is why I am worried about the future of Japan and the United States. (To be continued)</p>

The consuls and consuls are placed under the Governor-General of Kwantung. The relationship between the Kwantung Government and Manchuria and Mongolia will remain the same as the current system, that is, the army and navy will be the center, and a unified plan will be established. This system will be submitted to the Cabinet Council. However, this bill is only a provisional system during the period before the recognition of Manchukuo. After the official recognition is realized, it will be expanded and revised from the root, and a marshal-level governor-general will be established.</p>
<h3 id="e136">General Japanese Public Opinion <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Opposes Dictatorship</p>
<p>Supports the Constitutional System</p>
<p>World News Translation Agency Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun reported that a political conspiracy, the likes of which the empire has never seen in its history, is threatening the foundation of the empire. Among the many reactionary movements, the most prominent is the fascist movement, which is advocated by Privy Council Vice President Hiranuma and seems to be gaining the sympathy and support of the people. Hiranuma recently stated that the reactionary movement initiated by his political group, the Kokuhonsha, is completely different from Italian fascism. However, we cannot see where the differences lie. Hiranuma's party opposes constitutional convention and all other political parties, and advocates the establishment of a dictatorship to control all state organs. A large portion of public opinion is surprisingly supportive of this dangerous movement. There is no doubt that the rise of reactionary tendencies and their widespread sympathy are due to the incompetence of existing political parties and the selfishness of politicians. Political parties and their leaders disregard the happiness of the country and the people, causing the people to gradually increase their resentment towards them. The failure of the political parties has naturally caused reactionary movements. I fear that the time remaining for the political parties to fight for their lives is running out. We support those who sincerely uphold constitutionalism on the one hand and do not hesitate to warn the leaders of the political parties to quickly change their ways so that the people's trust in the political parties may still be retained.</p>
<p>Moreover, Miyako Shimbun said that the Minseito issued a statement denouncing fascism and all reactionary political tendencies. We feel that the Minseito and most of the public recognize that the so-called fascism that is rising in the empire is a doctrine that absolutely denies parliamentary politics. Italian fascism does not advocate violence. Although it has gained the support of the entire nation, the parliamentary system is still maintained. Therefore, it is a mistake to recognize fascism as conflicting with constitutionalism. The Japanese constitution was established since the Meiji Emperor's Restoration and is determined to be the permanent political system of the empire. Anyone who openly doubts or attempts to overthrow this foundation of the country, whether left-leaning or right-leaning, should of course be subject to strict legal sanctions. It is noteworthy that a certain group of soldiers absolutely deny the existence and powers of the Imperial Diet and, at the same time, disregard the restrictions imposed on the army and navy by the Imperial Constitution. This is truly strange.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Warlord Bandits Withdraw from Zhengyang <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Due to attacks by the local militia and Red Spear Society</p>
<p>The bandits retreated towards Yingheji</p>
<p>The local aftermath urgently needs to be addressed</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: After the bandits occupied Zhengyang, they looted wantonly for several days, kidnapping men and women and looting property, filling more than forty boats in total, and sailing upstream. The bandits entrenched inside and outside the town wantonly destroyed, causing the local area to be devastated. Cheng Yi's unit, the 718th Regiment of the 40th Independent Brigade of the Army, and Wang Shaojiu's unit, the 719th Regiment, were dispatched from Huoqiu to encircle and suppress them. When the troops reached Yuezhangji in Fengtai County, they adopted an encirclement strategy, attacking Zhengyang step by step. They came into contact with the bandits near Zhengyang a few days ago, and the battle was fierce, killing many bandits. Five or sixty soldiers of the Wang Regiment were killed or wounded, and the Cheng Regiment also suffered some casualties. Yang Chengxuan, the leader of the militia in Shouxian, Fengtai, and Ying Shang counties (from Yang Naozi, west of Zhengyang), also gathered thousands of local militia and Red Spear Society martial arts teams, uniting to attack the bandits. Seeing that the militia's guns and equipment were sophisticated and the momentum was huge, the bandits knew it would be difficult to resist, so at 5:00 AM on the 15th, they abandoned Zhengyang and retreated towards Mengjiawan and Yingheji. Before leaving, they took many more hostages. After this catastrophe in Zhengyang, the local essence has been completely lost. It will be difficult to recover within three to five years. After the headquarters of the Second Garrison Brigade here received definite news that the bandits had withdrawn from Zhengyang, Brigade Commander Li Yanqing immediately ordered Ni, the regimental commander stationed in Fengtai, to lead the first and second battalions of his regiment and various companies and platoons of machine guns, mortars, and communications to advance to Zhengyang and suppress the bandits as the opportunity arose. Song Shike, the brigade commander of the 40th Independent Brigade, arrived in Bengbu from Nanjing and, yesterday (the 15th) at 11:00 AM, also took a plane to scout around Zhengyang. Two planes went with him and dropped two bombs, both of which exploded upon landing, but the bandits had already withdrawn in the morning. It is unknown whether any innocent civilians were injured. Song Shike flew back in the afternoon. Today (the 16th) at 10:00 AM, he led his guards on the Jiangning ship from Bengbu to Zhengyang to supervise the suppression of the bandits. The Chamber of Commerce here received a telegram from the Shouxian Chamber of Commerce this morning (the 16th), also stating that the bandits had left Zhengyang and fled to the southeast, closer to Shou County, requesting that Wang's Brigade (i.e., the 10th Brigade of Xu Tingyao's 4th Division) be quickly requested to come to Shou to defend and suppress them. I just met with Yu Yumen, the head of the Zhengyang Defense Corps. According to him, the bandits did retreat to Mengjiawan, southwest of Zhengyang. Zhengyang has been devastated by this banditry. However, Mengjiawan is only twelve li away from Zhengyang. Although the bandits have temporarily retreated, optimism is not warranted. It is hoped that the Central Army will quickly pursue and suppress the bandits from Bengbu to save the survivors. Furthermore, handling the local aftermath brooks no delay. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e139">Han Fuqu's Exhortation <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Officers and soldiers protect the country and defend the people</p>
<p>Gathered officers for a joint celebration</p>
<p>Reviewed troops stationed in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, is now taking the opportunity to summon division and brigade commanders to Jinan in stages for joint celebrations, as banditry throughout the province has been largely suppressed and the region is gradually becoming stable. They will also discuss local defense matters together. He held a banquet for brigade commanders and militia commanders on the 15th and held a grand review on the 16th. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>The Provincial Government's Banquet: At 9:00 AM on the 15th, division and brigade commanders and militia commanders gathered in the East Building of the Provincial Government. Those present included Division Commanders Sun Tongxuan, Gu Liangmin, and Qiao Lizhi; Headquarters Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang; Building Director Zhang Shaotang; Military Law Department Director Li Wuchen; Quartermaster Department Director Tian Lianzhong; Military Affairs Department Director Xie Huawen; Ordnance Department Director Liu Kewen; Public Relations Department Director Zhang Xiyao; Medical Department Director Wang Qingxi; Wireless Management Office Director Zhang Yunting; Aide-de-Camp Han Wenxiu; Armored Car Commander Dai Hongbin; He Mengjiu, representative of Deputy Commander Liu Guitang of the Shandong Garrison; Second Route Commander Guo Wensheng; Brigade Commanders Lei Taiping, Li Hanzhang, Li Yizhi, Tang Bangzhi, Yun Qichang, Ning Chunxiao, Rong Guangxing, Ma Guanyi, Ma Jingong, Zhang Shulin, Li Zhanbiao, Chen Dexin, Zhao Xinde; Lunan Militia Commander Xie Shuxian; Luxi Militia Commander Gu Liangyou; Ludong Militia Commander Zhao Mingyuan; and Lubei Militia Commander Zhao Renquan, totaling more than thirty people. After all the participants arrived, Han Fuqu reported the significance of this gathering and the current situation, including domestic military and diplomatic affairs. He stated that he had not seen everyone for a long time, and it was rare for everyone stationed in the outer defenses to come to Jinan at the same time and gather together. The overall situation is currently relatively peaceful, the Shanghai war has been resolved, and the Japanese army is gradually withdrawing. Our country is preparing to take over the occupied areas. The Guangdong incident was purely a misunderstanding and has been mediated without incident. As for the military and political aspects of this province, it can be said that they have entered the right track. Bandits in various places have been gradually suppressed, and local security is gradually becoming stable. Brigade commanders and militia commanders are mostly stationed in outer counties and are close to the people. It is hoped that they will understand the hardships of the people, earnestly suppress bandits, protect the region, and fulfill the military's duty to protect the country and defend the people. Rewards and punishments for subordinates must be clear and fair, and there must be no incidents of disturbing the people. The significance of gathering everyone in Jinan is, first, to meet each other and get together to talk freely; second, if everyone has ideas or things that should be developed or reformed in terms of defense, they can be brought up for joint discussion to facilitate rectification. Around 10:00 AM, after the speech, they went to the West Flower Hall for a meal, and dispersed after 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Grand Review at Xinzhuang: In the morning of the 16th, Han ordered the troops stationed in Jinan to gather at Xinzhuang for a review. In addition to Han Fuqu, those present at the review included Division Commanders Sun Tongxuan and Qiao Lizhi; Brigade Commanders Lei Taiping, Tang Bangzhi, Yun Qichang, Chen Dexin, Li Hanzhang, Rong Guangxing, Li Yizhi, Ma Jingong, Zhang Shulin, Li Zhanbiao, Zhao Xinde, Ning Chunxiao, Ma Guanyi; He Mengjiu, representative of Deputy Commander Liu Guitang of the Shandong Garrison; Second Route Commander Guo Tiansheng; Armored Car Commander Dai Hongbin; Headquarters Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang; and various department heads. In addition to the Third Route Army troops stationed in Jinan, the 26th Route Army Heavy Artillery Battalion was also included, totaling the General Headquarters Guard Company, Pistol Brigade, Special Service Battalion, the 20th Division Headquarters and Special Service Battalion, the entire 58th Brigade, the entire 60th Brigade, the 74th Division Headquarters and Special Service Battalion, the entire 220th Brigade, the Engineering Battalion, Communications Battalion, and Railway Artillery Unit stationed in Jinan, various unit companies, various mortar companies and battalions, the 20th Division Artillery Regiment, the 26th Route Army Heavy Artillery Battalion, and various cavalry companies, totaling more than 20,000 people. All the troops receiving the review arrived at the Xinzhuang parade ground before 7:00 AM to await inspection. The review commander was Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division. After the troops were arranged in order, the review began at 8:00 AM. The reviewing officers rode around for a week to inspect. After the review, Han delivered a speech, stating that because the brigade commanders were stationed throughout Shandong Province, some counties were far from the province, and defense was important, it was not easy to see each other. Only a quarter of the troops were stationed in the province, and three-quarters were outside the province. Therefore, he took the opportunity of the brigade commanders coming to the province to see each other, and this was the meaning of today's gathering and review. We were born in the Republic of China, and are part of the people of the Republic of China, and also part of the military. What to do and what responsibilities to bear, everyone has been in the army for many years, and there is no need to say more. We are passing through day by day, month by month, year by year, and we must pay attention to time, and also make knowledge and thinking move forward with time. Doing more things while passing more time is not a wasted life. As an ordinary person, it is inevitable that one does not fully understand the situation of national diplomacy and internal affairs, but as a soldier and a civil servant, one must be clear about the national situation. In terms of the current international situation, in short, it is nothing more than Japan's invasion of China. The detailed situation is recorded in the newspapers, and everyone has probably seen it. People in the country are too disappointing, and everyone does not work hard, which has caused international troubles. Everyone knows my personality after being together for many years, so there is no need to talk about domestic and foreign situations. What everyone needs to pay attention to is understanding their responsibilities. Living in a certain place, one must fulfill the responsibilities of a soldier in that place. When foreigners invade, one must fulfill the responsibility of protecting territory, protecting sovereignty, and protecting the people. One must die at the right place and at the right time. Life and death are nothing, but they must have value. Domestically, one must protect the people's safety, and treat the people with kindness and patience, because most of the rural people have not received education, but soldiers, no matter what, have received education. For the people, even if one suffers a little loss, it is only right. Especially, everyone must understand that since ancient times, only those who can become one with the people can stand firm. Even if they fail, they will gain sympathy from public opinion. Although defeated, what is the difference from success? In the past, King Wu of Zhou had very few people, but he defeated tens of thousands of people. During the Three Kingdoms period, Yuan Shao and the Yellow Turbans had many people, but they ultimately failed. History proves that success or failure depends entirely on whether or not one gains the hearts of the people. It only depends on discipline. Good military discipline can win the sympathy of the people, and then one can win more with less. It is not only relying on skillful command and careful planning, but the main reason lies in the people. Yue Fei of the Song Dynasty was good at defeating more with less and greatly defeated the Jin people. The soldiers he led would rather starve to death than steal food from the people, and would rather freeze to death than enter civilian houses, protecting the people everywhere, so he ultimately gained the people's admiration. The key lies in harmony, not in numbers. It is impossible not to unite with the people. I hope everyone will use their brains more on this. Furthermore, in training the troops, there are different methods for winter, spring, and autumn. In spring and autumn, there can be more field exercises. In summer, when the weather is too hot, pay more attention to mental lectures and individual training to make them understand the situation of national humiliation and plan for the people, with a spirit of sacrifice. Often conduct guerrilla training in the woods. Furthermore, special attention must be paid to the training of newly recruited soldiers. New soldiers are like new brides. They are free at home, but after marriage, everything is restricted. When new soldiers come to the barracks, all aspects of life change. They must be treated with sympathy and trained slowly. Do not seek too much too quickly, and then there will be good results. After Han finished speaking, the officers returned to their respective teams. Han then spoke with the brigade commanders until 11:00 AM before dispersing. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e140">Central Government Takes Back <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Shandong National Tax Agencies</p>
<p>Han's troops' military pay is still allocated monthly by the Central Government</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu of the Shandong Third Route Army recently borrowed Central Government tax funds to maintain the soldiers' livelihood due to the lack of military pay. He appointed people to act as agents in the national tax agencies in Shandong, such as the Salt Transport Envoy, the Luyu Regional Unified Tax Bureau, the Jinan Branch, the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, the Lu Da Mining Tax Office, the Zhongxing Mining Tax Office, and the Smoke Tax Bureau, except for Ren Wenhan, the Director of the Nitrates and Minerals Bureau. This has been going on for several months. Recently, Jiang Bocheng, representative of the Central Government, came to Jinan to meet with Han and negotiate a solution to restore the original state of the national tax system so that the Central Government's authority can be unified. Han stated that as long as the Central Government distributes military pay, the soldiers can maintain their livelihood, and the national tax agencies can be returned. Therefore, Jiang and Han proceeded to study the method of returning them. Except for the Salt Transport Envoy, where the Central Government appointed Li Fengyao, and the Binnan Branch of the Luyu Unified Tax Bureau, where the Central Government appointed Xu Tierui, the rest were recommended by Han. It is rumored that Li Wuchen, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, Meng Zhaokong, Deputy Director, and Li Rukui of the Lu Da Mining Tax Office (details of the Zhongxing Mining Tax Office and the Smoke Tax Bureau are unknown) were all appointed by the Central Government. Han's troops' monthly military pay is still 600,000 yuan, which will be issued by the Central Government in the future. Han expressed satisfaction with this. Jiang then hosted a banquet for the new and old Salt Transport Envoys and the new and old Jinan Directors of the Unified Tax Bureau to discuss the handover methods. It is rumored that it was decided to hand over on the 18th. Jiang Bocheng left Jinan for Beiping tonight (the 16th) after his official duties were completed. According to Jiang's remarks when he left Jinan, "The Shandong national tax agencies have all been returned to the Central Government. All personnel will be appointed by the Central Government. Han's troops' military pay will be issued by the Central Government on time in the future. The result is satisfactory, and there should be no more rumors from the outside world. As for the current salt tax surcharges, the Ministry of Finance will issue an order to handle them. Since my affairs have been completed, I will return to Beiping tonight." Xu Tieshan also said that the Jinan Collection Office of the Luyu Unified Tax Bureau will be taken over on the 18th. The revenue situation of the Shandong unified tax is estimated to be more than 40,000 yuan per month for wheat flour tax, more than 30,000 yuan for match tax, and more than 20,000 yuan for cotton yarn tax. Plans will be made to organize them in the future, and there should be further increases. (16th)</p>

<p>Full of internal war scenes</p>
<p>Deng Longguang takes over the Navy Department</p>
<p>Inland river ships are stationed in sections</p>
<p>Forts are being built near Guangzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Chen Jitang's capture of part of Chen Ce's fleet has led to a situation where part of the air force (Zhang Huichang's faction) is concentrated in Qiongya with the outgoing fleet, forming a confrontational situation with Chen Jitang's army. Recently, Chen Jitang has been particularly anxious to deal with the air force and navy in Qiongya. On the 11th, he sent Chief Counselor Deng Longguang to take over the Navy Headquarters. At 9:00 AM that day, Deng arrived at the Navy Headquarters to take over all files, documents, and public property, and summoned the captains of the inland river ships who had surrendered to the headquarters to give them instructions. He encouraged the captains and then called the roll of the captains and reappointed them. They included Huang Zhaotang, captain of the Jianru ship; Yao Dong, captain of the Zhongkai ship; He Yilu, captain of the Zhongyuan ship; Du Chunxin, captain of the Haifang ship; Wen Hangang, captain of the Guang'an ship; Tang Zhenxing, captain of the Zhongzheng ship; Chen Mingchuan, captain of the Cunjin ship; Wu Zili, captain of the Fuyou ship; Zhang Cheng, captain of the Anxin ship; Gu Shengkai, captain of the Jiangshun ship; He Dong, captain of the Jinma ship; Cen Tanzhi, captain of the Guangdong ship; Li Yuanchu, captain of the Yuexing ship; and Zhou Changqi, captain of the Guanghua ship; Tan Xiangrong, captain of the Lichen ship. In addition to the naval headquarters staff, those who resigned were replaced, and the rest temporarily continued to work as usual. After Deng took over the Navy Headquarters, he also announced to all parties that he was acting as the Navy Commander and would no longer hold an inauguration ceremony. On the same day, Chen Jitang also appointed Li Qingwen as Deputy Navy Commander and Li Julu as Chief of Staff of the Navy Headquarters. As for Zhao Guizhang, who took over the fleet a few days ago, he is currently responsible for unblocking the return of the captains to the team and will not take office for the time being, only serving as the captain of the Guangjin ship. However, Zhao went to meet with Chen Ce in and went to Macau to contact the captains of the outgoing ships, but it is said that he has not gained anything and has returned to the province to report everything to Chen Jitang. Chen Jitang, seeing that Chen Ce's outgoing fleet was entrenched in Hainan (i.e., Qiongya), made strict precautions in advance. The inland river ships that have surrendered have recently been ordered to be stationed in sections in various inland rivers, paying particular attention to the defense of the West River in order to prevent Chen Ce's outgoing ships from attacking. Forts have also been built at Changjianggang and Xiuyinggang, strategically important locations in Dashan Township near Guangzhou. Trenches have been dug around the forts, and the mountain artillery team directly under the Second Army is stationed there permanently. Two 7.5-inch heavy cannons, several anti-aircraft guns, and more than ten mortars are installed on the forts to control the air and sea raids on Guangzhou. At the same time, ships entering and leaving the river surface of the fort are inspected. Ships without a pass from the First Group Army Headquarters are not allowed to pass. Therefore, the fort's defense is no less than that of the Humen and Changzhou forts. Since Chen Jitang's defense of Guangzhou is so strict, he will further send troops to attack Qiongya during the day. It is rumored that Chen Zhangfu, a member of the South District Pacification Department, will be appointed as the Commander for Bandit Suppression in Qiongya. Chen has been summoned back to the province and will return to the South Road to make arrangements after Chen Jitang's instructions. Chen Jitang also plans to transfer four to five regiments of troops from Xiang Hanping's unit of the Second Army to the South Road to be commanded by Chen Zhangfu to attack Qiongya. Therefore, the local civil war in Guangdong Province will begin immediately. (May 13th)</p>

<p>Denounces the Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<p>The National Crisis Relief Association telegraphed: "To all newspaper offices and the people of the Korean National Convention, the Shanghai Feng War Agreement was hastily signed, and the content is contrary to the various people's organizations, and the industry has been criticized. This association deliberates and considers that there are still things that must be solemnly reported to the country. The Shanghai War and the Northeast issue should be resolved in combination, as a major policy for our foreign affairs. The people advocate in the front, and the government pledges in the back. Now the authorities intend to seek temporary peace, and suddenly stop the Shanghai war alone so that the enemy can devote all its strength to the Northeast. The ink of the signature has not dried, and the beacon of Yuguan has risen. It is clear from the facts that the overall situation has been defeated. Moreover, the government has repeatedly stated that the ceasefire agreement does not involve political clauses, but according to Article 2 of the agreement, our country's troops will temporarily stay in their current positions until a method for restoring normalcy is determined. This is tantamount to establishing a guarantee for future political clauses, and even in terms of the present, this provision is equivalent to setting up a temporary non-military zone, so how is it different from a political clause? This is the big picture, deceiving the country and the people, and there is no way to conceal it. If the government authorities still know their political responsibility, they should have dealt with it themselves long ago, and not wait for the serious indignation of the people. In addition, all important international matters must be decided by the Legislative Yuan, as clearly stipulated in Article 29 of the National Government Organization Law. The content of the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement is of great importance, and in addition to the Chinese representative and the Japanese minister signing it, the ambassadors of the Four Allied Nations also signed it. In fact, in form and substance, it is clearly an important international agreement without any doubt. Even if the Executive Yuan does not allow the people to participate, it ignores the brilliant powers of the Legislative Yuan in this national law. Therefore, although the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement has been signed, it does not have valid conditions in our current national law, and cannot be considered to have taken effect. Our country has no reason to be bound by it. This should be clearly announced. In short, Japan is violent and unyielding, and has angered the world. Russia and the United States have risen, and it is inevitable. For the sake of self-defense, our country has no choice but to quickly devote all its strength to pacifying the bandits, eliminating civil wars, completing military preparations, and jointly shoulder the great responsibility of maintaining world justice. There is no room for further hesitation, even if the Japanese repent halfway, and speak of peace with an open mind, the Northeast and Shanghai incidents must be combined to form a fair and just solution. If there is an excuse to use the national law's invalid ceasefire agreement to arbitrarily restrict our country's freedom, or to advocate opening any meeting first, then our people will never recognize it as long as they have a breath. We hereby announce this, hoping to work together. National Crisis Relief Association, Republic of China."</p>

<p>The Special Party Branch of the 61st Division recently sent a telegram to General Ma Zhanshan, saying: "General Ma Zhanshan, the heroic figure of Heilongjiang, the glory of Liao and Jilin is lost, and the nation is in danger. You have raised the national prestige in the remote areas and declared justice to the world. Your ambition is enough to chill the enemy's courage, and your heroic spirit has shocked your comrades. Now the violent bandits are at the end of their rope, and they are using tricks to annex Manchuria and Mongolia with the old tricks of destroying Korea, not hesitating to instigate traitors to form a puppet state. You were forced to deal with this in reality, and you pretended to be cooperative, investigating the inside story from within, and immediately exposed its conspiracy. Guan Zhuangmiao abandoned Cao and returned to Han, and Di Renjie turned against Zhou and returned to Tang. Their righteousness is awe-inspiring, and their merits are immortal. Recently, we learned that you have reorganized your troops and repeatedly defeated the fierce bandits. We admire your divine power. We hope that you will continue to work hard and not betray your original intentions. Our division has a strong sense of common hatred and vows to be your backup. Preparedness Committee of the Special Party Branch of the 61st Division of the Army of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>

<p>Reinstatement of Four District Police Stations</p>
<p>Since our police took over the four districts of Zhabei, the market has gradually recovered, and residents have returned one after another. However, at the intersections of the Chinese-controlled areas such as the Xin Zha Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, and Mongolia Road, the barbed wire and sandbags piled up in the past have not yet been removed, causing much inconvenience for Zhabei residents to travel back and forth. The municipal government has sent a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting the prompt removal of these obstacles to facilitate transportation. It is now known that the barbed wire and sandbags at the Xin Zha Bridge and Wuzhen Road Bridge were removed yesterday morning at 10 o'clock by coolies dispatched by the Public Works Department. At the same time, the Wuzhen Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau at that location was restored to its original post by District Chief Wu Shaolin, who dispatched patrol officer Ma Hualin, leading police chiefs Yin Yuanfa and Wu Heming, as well as three squads of police officers. However, the internal equipment of the police station has been stolen and almost completely destroyed. Yesterday, patrol officer Ma and others ordered craftsmen to start tidying up, and the police officers have resumed their posts as usual.</p>

<p>Advocates for Soldiers</p>
<p>To Use Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the various groups of the National Salvation Federation sent a letter to Zhao Yijian, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, supporting his proposed methods for the Military Thrift Association, and also sent a letter to the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting its promotion. The two letters are as follows: (To Zhao Yijian: Dear Mr. Yijian, Upon reading the newspaper recently, we learned that you are initiating a Military Thrift Association, advocating for soldiers to use domestic cloth and prohibiting the use of imported woolens. At this time when the foreign enemy is deepening and the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, the Chinese people should strive to be vigorous, endure hardships, and cultivate a frugal atmosphere, working hard to encourage self-reliance and self-rescue in order to save the country. After repeated reading, we deeply admire your plan. The members of this association express our strong support. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Interior to issue orders to all military police under their jurisdiction to implement it consistently, we hope that you will widely publicize it to create a military cloth clothing movement, which will be truly beneficial to the people's livelihood and national economy. (To the Ministry of Military Affairs) Dear Sirs, With national crisis at hand and the people's livelihood in distress, promoting domestic products is of utmost urgency. Yesterday, upon reading the newspaper, we learned that Zhao Yijian, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, is advocating for soldiers to use domestic cloth and prohibiting the use of imported woolens, promoting thrift, and plugging loopholes. This is a national salvation remedy that is very timely and should be vigorously promoted and effectively implemented. We earnestly request your Ministry to issue orders to all the army, navy, divisions, brigades, warships, and police in provinces, cities, and counties across the country to use domestic products uniformly, cultivate a frugal atmosphere, and recover lost sources of profit. Anyone who violates this will be strictly punished. The people's livelihood and national economy truly depend on it.</p>

<p>Couple Commits Suicide by Drowning in Suzhou</p>
<p>Left a Will That Is Too Painful to Read</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 19th stated that Mr. Qian Junyi and his wife Zhao Pinfang, residents of Zhongxing Road in Zhabei, suffered disaster this time, with their entire family being killed. Only they themselves escaped to Suzhou. Yesterday, they both drowned in the river at Qian Wanli Bridge in Suzhou Railway Station. This morning, they were found, reportedly still embracing each other. The court conducted an inquest at 4 p.m. The will was a thousand words long, detailing the origins and circumstances in great detail. A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 19th stated that the original text of the will in the double drowning case read: "The Japanese bandits erupted, killing wantonly. The home of Junyi on Zhongxing Road was right in the path of destruction. Fortunately, Pinfang was suffering from liver disease, which was very serious at the time, and they rented another house on Route Lafayette in the French Concession, seeking safety and medical treatment. Junyi accompanied her, and the two were spared from the disaster. However, the resentment and pain in their hearts was worse than enduring calamity. The family fortune was exhausted, and the adopted son Yu Xing, along with the nanny and six employees of the pharmacy, all died tragically. If it were not for the words 'Avenge National Humiliation' printed on the China Pharmacy National Pill, the disaster would never have been so severe. The Japanese bandits hate our resistance, so they hate even more those who can resist their business. Therefore, in addition to the Commercial Press and other cultural institutions suffering the most, the Wuzhou Pharmacy also suffered a terrible disaster. The Japanese bandits have long regarded Eastern Province medicines as the origin of Chinese domestic production, and the China Pharmacy as the initiator of raising funds for the righteous cause. There was a search for the words 'Avenge National Humiliation,' and the houses and goods were all destroyed, leading to today's utter poverty. The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. Those of us who have survived the disaster should be even more vigorous. It is a pity that we are weak and unable to hold a knife to join the army and kill bandits. The good prescriptions obtained through careful research will also be lost. Unexpectedly, poverty and illness have become entangled, leading to distress and danger. We have no relatives to turn to, and our friends are scattered. Although our ambition has not been extinguished, the situation is no longer what it was. What is the use? (Omitted) Wuxian is Junyi's original place of origin, and some of his cousins have shops there. Should he go to his original place of origin, hoping to get ancestral blessing and meet his relatives, and thereby find a chance to survive? Otherwise, it would be a great fortune to die by the ancestors' tombs rather than by the swords of the Japanese bandits. So he brought his wife to Suzhou. After a day, he found that he was of upright nature, not good at inquiring, and that God did not favor him, with continuous rain and exhausted funds. There was no chance of survival. In such a predicament, what should he do? He decided not to blindly follow fate and end it all. Attached is a request to be buried next to the ancestral grave. Our great-grandfather, Lord Zhishan, had three sons: Yutian, Futian, and Houtian. Junyi's grandfather, Lord Futian, moved to Shanghai, where he gave birth to our father, Lord Lanchang, who gave birth to Junyi, also known as Huizhi. Junyi is 38 years old, and his wife Zhao Pinfang is 32 years old."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Jiangwan's Sufferers' Association Continues to Request <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Relief for Disaster Victims and Exemption from Land Tax</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangwan District Disaster Victims' Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating, "Submitting a request for prompt relief for the disaster victims in our district and exemption from this year's land tax and past arrears, we respectfully request your approval. We believe that during this Japanese invasion, our district became the center of the war, with houses turned into ruins and lives devastated. The surviving disaster victims have no way to seek survival and are in a state of utter misery. Our association previously represented all the disaster victims in the district, submitting a document and earnestly requesting exemption from this year's land tax and past arrears, so as to allow the remaining survivors to breathe. We have now read in the newspapers that the provincial government has allocated 300,000 yuan in cash to the disaster-stricken counties under the province to prepare for emergency relief, and that counties such as Tai, Jia, and Bao have already scheduled relief. The disaster situation in our district is extremely severe, unprecedented in ancient times, and relief is urgently needed. This should be carefully considered. We believe that the disaster victims in our district sacrificed their lives and fortunes for the country during the war without complaint, understanding that the order in the rear must be in good order during a long-term resistance. Now that the withdrawal of troops has been agreed upon and the accommodation has ended, the disaster victims in our district will have to return to their homeland, and the so-called clothing, food, and shelter are all gone. If the assistance is delayed, we cannot help but worry about the future. Therefore, we dare to continue requesting that a method be promptly determined to provide full relief. Secondly, according to the investigation by our association, the war losses in our district, for which there are records, include more than 500 deaths and 7,600 houses burned down. The cries of ghosts in the wilderness and the wails of people on the roads are a scene too tragic for human beings to bear. Reports indicate that the Municipal Land Bureau is urging the payment of winter grain, and notices of the temporary suspension of land sales in the war zone have been issued one after another. If the land tax in our district is not exempted, the farmers after the disaster, in addition to their own bodies, have nothing else. Even if they want to sell their fields and houses at the lowest price to pay the grain, it is impossible. Therefore, we dare to continue requesting that an order be issued to exempt this year's land tax and past arrears in our district. Based on the above reasons, we dare to submit another document to the senior officials, urgently requesting your approval to extend the last breath of the disaster victims. We are in a state of anxiety and trepidation, awaiting your orders."</p>

<p>The Fengyu Lane on Hanzhong Road in Zhabei originally had more than 40 houses. Recently, the landlords of the lane, seeing that the Japanese army had withdrawn, had most of the residents move back. However, the lane was filled with accumulated dust and overflowing sewage. To facilitate residents' access and maintain public health, yesterday morning (the 19th), four workers were hired to clear the lane of filth. Suddenly, at around 4:00 pm, they seemed to feel something blocking the ditch. They opened the ditch cover in front of house number 23 in the lane and were shocked to find a female corpse lying face up inside. As the hole was small, they could not immediately lift it out. Upon inspection, the corpse seemed to be wearing black clothes with a flannel undershirt. The breasts and nose were already severely decayed. There was a gold tooth inlaid in the upper neck, and a hemp rope was tied around the neck. The whole body was covered with mud and was abnormally swollen, making it impossible to identify. Residents from near and far came to watch the spectacle, and the crowds were almost overwhelming. For a time, Hanzhong Road became bustling with heated discussions and conflicting opinions. However, as the corpse had been dead for many days, the foul odor was overwhelming, and passersby could not help but cover their noses and pass by. Afterward, the landlord of the lane reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched officers to verify the facts and immediately ordered the local bailiff to report to the local court for an inquest and further investigation.</p>

<p>Water Rises Twenty-Four Feet</p>
<p>Wuhan Builds High Embankments and Fortifies Sluice Gates</p>
<p>The river water in Hankou has risen twenty-four feet. The usual level is fourteen to fifteen feet, about eleven to twelve feet when receding, and never more than sixteen to seventeen feet. Last year, during the Wuhan floods, the water rose to more than thirty feet. This year, the river water receded unusually shallowly in the spring. It was not until the beginning of this month that it gradually increased. On the thirteenth and fourteenth, the water in Hankou surged to sixteen feet, and the next day it surged again to twenty feet, causing great panic. Unexpectedly, after the fifteenth, it suddenly rose four feet in twenty-four hours, reaching twenty-four feet. The upstream water also seems to be flowing downstream, and there is no telling how high it will rise.</p>
<p>Rushing to Build the Wutai Sluice Gate The Wutai Sluice Gate in Wuhan is the first line of defense against the water in Hankou and is the responsibility of the Public Works Bureau. Managers now face a situation where the river water in Wuhan has suddenly increased by seven or eight feet in the past ten days. The people of Wuhan, having learned a lesson from last year's floods, are all fearful. The Wuhan Water Conservancy Bureau, aware of the rapid rise in water, is preparing urgently. Since the sixteenth, it has specially assigned 800 people to rush to repair the Wutai Sluice Gate, working day and night to ensure that the sluice gate is consolidated and does not collapse.</p>
<p>Adding Embankments Along the Gan and Han Rivers Although the embankments along the river from Jiujiang to Hankou have been repaired, yesterday, Shanghai merchants received a telegram from Hankou stating that the water level had been rising continuously in recent days. During high tide, the river water was only one and a half to two feet away from the embankment. If it rises again, it will be as destructive as last year. Therefore, the Disaster Relief Supervisory Committee has allocated a portion of the disaster relief funds for work relief, ordering farmers along the river from Gan to Han to start work simultaneously on the sixteenth, raising the embankment to the height agreed upon during last year's flood. They have been rushing to build it day and night.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks the Municipal Government <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>To Demand the Return of Chinese Detained by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce formally requested the Municipal Government to negotiate with the Japanese side to release all the detained Chinese. The formal request stated: "Regarding the formal request for this matter, on the 18th of this month, we received a letter from Jiang Xietai's Workshop, stating that the workshop is located in Hongkou, and after the Sino-Japanese War broke out, eight of the workshop's employees were detained by the Japanese army on January 30th. Several months have passed, and their fate is unknown. After the incident, we immediately reported it to various relief organizations in Shanghai and appealed for rescue, but to no avail. We have now heard that there are still detained Chinese who have not been released, and we are formally requesting your association to investigate according to the attached list of names and origins submitted by the workshop. Please inquire with the Japanese military authorities or other relevant agencies, check by name to see if they have been tried, and try to obtain their release. We earnestly request that you consider the painful situation of the families of the detainees and make every effort to negotiate with the Japanese side. If you can reunite the relatives, your virtue will be immeasurable. Attached is a list. We hope that you will investigate." Upon investigation, according to precedents, on the day when both sides exchange prisoners, those who were arrested due to military suspicion should also be released at the same time. The exchange of prisoners between China and Japan in Shanghai was implemented on April 15th. The Chinese arrested by the Japanese due to military suspicion should also be released at the same time. However, it has been repeatedly reported that the Public Works Department has investigated and reported that the number of missing persons still far exceeds the number of those released, with several hundred people still unaccounted for. It is speculated that the Japanese side only released those they deemed definitely not suspicious, while those suspected were still detained. However, now that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement has been formally signed, those arrested due to military suspicion should be treated the same as prisoners of war. There is no reason to mutually exchange prisoners of war, but to continue to detain those suspected of military suspicion. This principle should exist after the ceasefire. Regardless of where they were arrested, whether in the concession or not, the people are ultimately Chinese citizens. Several hundred people are still missing. In addition to the eight employees of the above-mentioned workshop who were arrested, whose names are listed and attached, we formally request your government to examine and approve the matter. Please seriously negotiate with the Japanese side, and release all the Chinese arrested by the Japanese after January 28th, and return the bodies of the dead. Do not allow this matter to be dealt with vaguely, so as to value human life. Submitted to the Municipal Government, with the following list: (1) Shi Zhenqian, 52 years old, from Xiaoshuhe East, Chongming; (2) Shi Falang, 33 years old, same as above; (3) Qiu Dalang, 19 years old, same as above; (4) Gu Lansun, 24 years old, from Wanshou'an, Liuhuo North; (5) Jin Yongqi, 26 years old, from Loutang North; (6) Kunyuan, 27 years old, from Shuhe Town, Chongming; (7) Huang Xifan, 18 years old, from Xinkaihe, Chongming; (8) Zhou Zuguo, 25 years old, from Shuhe Town, Chongming."</p>

<h3 id="e160">Niujiaojian, Pudong <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Farmers' Corps Members Engage in Fierce Battle with Bandits</p>
<p>Thirteen Bandits Captured</p>
<p>Two Farmers Shot and Killed</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, a large gang of 78 bandits arrived in Niujiaojian, Yuanbei Township, Nanhui County, Pudong, and engaged in a fierce battle with the local defense corps and farmers overnight. Thirteen bandits were captured (one of whom died), and two farmers were also shot and killed by the bandits. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Menacing Faces Niujiaojian is a remote town with only three or five small shops. The farmers in the surrounding villages are good at bird hunting and are known for their bravery. During their leisure time, they gather in the town to play or sit in small teahouses to drink tea. Foreigners rarely pass through the area. At around 4:00 pm on the 13th of this month, a large gang of men with menacing faces suddenly arrived in the town from the Lijiaqiao area to the west, in groups of three or five, and continued eastward. In total, there were about seventy or eighty people. The farmers sitting in the small teahouse were suspicious of this situation and immediately responded to the call, grabbing their bird guns and surrounding the last batch of three people. They found a pistol and confessed that they were bandits, saying that their accomplices had all gone east. Upon hearing this, the farmers chased eastward. After about an hour, they caught five more and brought them back for interrogation.</p>
<p>Miserable Death of a Salt Merchant The bandits who escaped to the Huizhoudian area in the southeast, learned that eight of their accomplices had been arrested and were unwilling to give up. They waited until around 8:00 pm and then returned west to prepare to rob the arrestees. However, the police alarm had already reached the surrounding villages. A farmer named Zhang Guiqing, 55 years old, who was a salt merchant, was energetic. At the time, he was armed with a gun and ambushed on the beach west of Huizhoudian, preparing to intercept the bandits. Suddenly, he heard a lot of footsteps from the beach on the opposite side and saw electric lights shining. He immediately shouted to ask for the password. Unexpectedly, the group was a gang of bandits who shined the electric light on Zhang's body and suddenly fired seven or eight shots from Mauser pistols. The bullets hit Zhang's body, and three shots hit his waist and abdomen, causing his intestines to flow out. He immediately fell to the beach and died.</p>
<p>A Fierce Battle The bandits still wanted to go west, but gunshots from the surrounding villages were as dense as a string of pearls, and shouts of catching robbers were also loud. Knowing that things were not good, they ran back east. At that time, the news spread to all places, and the defense corps from Beicai, Zhangjiangzha, Changting'an, Shiyan Township, and other places sent teams to join the suppression. Seeing that there were people surrounding them from all sides, the bandits stopped near the Zhuangjia Temple, about three miles northwest of Huizhoudian, and scattered in all directions, hiding in the reed marshes and wheat fields to resist. The area was surrounded by more than 100 members of the defense corps and dozens of farmers. It was late at night, and they were shooting at each other in the dark. After a while, a farmer named Jia was shot and killed. The fierce battle lasted until midnight, and the defense corps fired more than a thousand shots, gradually advancing into the wheat fields and reed marshes. Seeing that the bandits could not resist, they broke through in the direction where the gunshots were sparse and rushed west. Four people were captured on the spot, and the main force was able to escape. The members of the defense corps followed and chased west. They pursued until about 3:00 am and captured another bandit at the Jiajiaquan area in Xilonggou. Seeing that the bandits had gone far, the members of the defense corps began to return.</p>
<p>Thirteen Bandits Captured A total of five bandits were captured in this battle. One bandit had several gunshot wounds and was dying. Another bandit also had several gunshot wounds, but he was still conscious because they were not critical. Two other bandits had minor injuries. That night, the defense corps took the eight bandits captured earlier by the farmers in Niujiaojian and escorted them to the Zhangjiangzha Public Security Bureau, interrogated them one by one, and then sent them to the Nanhui County Government for interrogation at dawn. One of the seriously injured bandits died before reaching the county, while one seriously injured bandit and two slightly injured bandits were sent to Gongzheng Hospital for treatment before being interrogated. It is reported that two bullets have been removed from the seriously injured bandit.</p>
<p>Inspection of Remains The remains of the two farmers, Zhang Guiqing and others, who died during the capture of the bandits, have been inspected by Auditor Wang Cheng, who was assigned by the county government. They were instructed to hand them over to the family members for preliminary burial, pending review. The family members of Zhang Guiqing, on the other hand, demanded generous compensation from the government because Zhang died in the line of duty, so they were unwilling to bury him. After the county government persuaded them, they agreed to bury him.</p>
<p>Remaining Harm from the Traitors The captured bandits all spoke with a Yangzhou accent and wore symbols issued by illegal organizations affiliated with the former Zhabei traitors. Each person had a square symbol. The weapons they carried were mainly pistols and Mauser pistols. One of the bandits was reportedly a former patrol captain of the Zhangjiangzha Public Security Bureau, who had been dismissed not long ago. The purpose of the bandits' trip, whether it was solely for robbery or if there was another motive, is still under strict investigation by the county government. The day after the incident, the members of the defense corps searched several Jiangbei boats in the nearby waters around Niujiaojian, but nothing was found.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Bureau of Social Affairs <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Planning the Establishment of Pauper Asylums</p>
<p>Intended to be Implemented in Three Steps</p>
<p>Since assuming office, Director Mai Chaoshu of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in view of the fact that vagrants and beggars are rampant in the city, a phenomenon unique among the major cities of the country, which is closely related to international perception and public safety and hygiene, believes that it will be difficult to achieve results without fundamentally addressing the problem. Therefore, he consulted with Director Cai of the Bureau of Finance, who agreed to provide assistance, and planned to consult with the authorities of the two concession areas to assist in the implementation. At the same time, he instructed the head of the Fourth Section to draft a plan and budget for the pauper asylum, in order to actively implement it. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident erupted, and the bureau devoted all its efforts to various relief efforts, and the aforementioned plan was therefore suspended. Now that the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement has been concluded, relief work can be said to have come to an end. However, since the outbreak of the war, the city has suffered many damages, and the city treasury's income has been greatly affected. All the aforementioned plans have had to be adjusted and implemented in stages. The plan and budget draft have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. The outline of the original proposal for phased implementation is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The presentation is for the matter of requesting instructions. This city is one of the six major commercial ports in the world, connecting China and foreign countries. Celebrities from all over the world often come to China for inspection, generalizing the whole country from one corner, so international perception is particularly important. The citizens are of mixed origin, with good and bad people mixed together, and vagrants and beggars are visible everywhere, which not only hinders the appearance of the city, but also has a close relationship with public security and hygiene. According to previous reports, vagrants and beggars are a festering sore on society, with a vague organization, committing petty theft and all kinds of crimes, and are the medium of all kinds of evils. The gathering of these vagrants and beggars is due to the frequent national disasters in recent years, internal and external troubles, natural and man-made disasters, all occurring one after another. The livelihood of the people in the inland is difficult, or they regard Shanghai as a paradise, and come one after another. However, in recent years, industry and commerce have been declining, and the original businesses are already difficult to support, and many people are unemployed and find it difficult to make a living. Therefore, the number of vagrants and beggars is increasing day by day. The situation in this city is special, and police power is still difficult to unify. The police authorities find it difficult to clear up vagrants and beggars. At present, there are only two vagrant shelters run by charitable organizations, one is the Vagrant Work Practice Center in Caohejing, Nanshi, with a quota of 500 people, and the other is the Vagrant Work Practice Center on Liuying Road, Zhabei, with a quota of 350 people. With so many vagrants and beggars in this city, and only these two shelters, the disparity is so great that vagrants and beggars are everywhere in this city, becoming a phenomenon that has never existed in the major cities of the country. Since the director took office, he has witnessed the situation and his duty lies in urgently seeking remedies. He was instructing his subordinates to start planning when the January 28th Incident occurred, causing a huge wave, and he had to devote his efforts to relief work. The war destroyed the second Vagrant Work Practice Center, and the vagrants fled. After the war, the city treasury was depleted, and it was no longer what it used to be. The aforementioned plan had to be adjusted and implemented in three steps, to suit the financial resources. The first step is (A) to urge the Shanghai Charity Association to restore the second Vagrant Work Practice Center to its original state in a short period of time; (B) to urge the Shanghai Charity Association to initially expand the first Vagrant Work Practice Center and increase the number of people it can accommodate by 500. The cost of food and clothing for each person is estimated at eight silver dollars, requiring a monthly operating expense of four thousand yuan. The construction cost is proposed to be raised by the association, and the operating expenses are proposed to be allocated by the city treasury. The second step is to set up a pauper asylum in the Yinxiang area, with a temporary quota of 2,000 people. The cost of land purchase, construction, and operation will be borne by the city treasury, and the bureau will send personnel to manage it. The third step is to set up a pauper asylum in each of the southeast, southwest, and west areas of the city, each with a quota of 2,000 people. In total, the city-run pauper asylums will accommodate 8,000 people. Together with the total number of shelters run by the charity association, it will reach 10,000 people. At that time, although we dare not say that there will be no vagrants and beggars in the city, if the Chinese and foreign police authorities can cooperate and strictly arrest them, the city's appearance can be refreshed. The funds for the pauper asylums in the southeast, southwest, and west districts will be discussed with the authorities of the two concession areas after the first pauper asylum in the Zhabei district has achieved significant results. At the same time, it is proposed to levy surcharges on various taxes in the city, such as house rent, etc. If it is still not enough, then raise funds from the citizens. However, this matter is of great importance and requires a large amount of funding. We have prepared a plan for the establishment of the Shanghai Pauper Asylum, and after the first asylum has been successfully run, other urban areas can follow suit. We have attached the aforementioned plan and our humble opinions, and submit them to your Excellency for review and instruction, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The first step is to instruct the Shanghai Charity Association to prepare for the restoration of the second Vagrant Work Practice Center as soon as possible: (A) investigate the losses; (B) repair the houses; (C) recruit the homeless; (D) restore the work; (E) expand the quota. At the same time, discuss with various philanthropists to expand the construction of the first Vagrant Work Practice Center and increase the number of people it can accommodate by 500 (for a total of 1,000 people including the original quota). The second step is to wait until the city treasury's income recovers after one year, and then submit a request to the municipal government to allocate funds to purchase 50 mu of land in the Yinxiang area and plan the construction drawings. At the same time, discuss assistance measures with the authorities of the two concession areas. The third step is to build the first pauper asylum and achieve significant results, and then set up a pauper asylum in each of the Nanshi, Pudong, and Huxi districts. The required expenses will be determined based on the situation at that time, and then specific measures will be considered.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Records of the Public Works Bureau Affairs <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Public Utilities Committee Meeting. The Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau recently held a meeting. Mr. Bian Sheng proposed, and Mr. Wu Yunzhai seconded, the election of Mr. Arnold as Chairman of the Committee. Mr. An immediately stated that as the current Chairman of the Public Bus Company, if matters concerning the company are discussed in the future, another committee member should be invited to chair the meeting. This proposal was agreed to by the committee members, and Mr. An agreed to take the position of Chairman of the Committee.</p>
<p>Telephone Price Increase Issue. The General Office of the Public Works Bureau stated in a letter that the telephone company requested that it be allowed to increase prices from March 26th of this year, when the entire concession area was converted to automatic telephones. It was found that this matter should be discussed with the French Concession, and it was requested that staff members from the bureau be sent to consult with the French Concession and the company, as in previous cases. Another user suggested that the company's capital expenditures for the past twenty months should be reviewed before the price increase. After deliberation by the Public Utilities Committee, it was considered that if the price increase did not exceed the standards in the Ansen report, then auditing the accounts would not be necessary. The responsibility for preliminary contact could be undertaken by the General Manager and the Director of Finance, and then reported to the Committee. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Water Supply Investigation Case. At a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee on May 12th, the General Manager of the Public Works Bureau reported that on December 24th of last year, the Water Supply Investigation Committee (composed of the previous Public Utilities Committee members and two additional Chinese committee members) decided to discuss Hill's report after the Director of Finance and the Director of the Three Affairs Bureau had signed it. However, the Director of the Public Works Bureau had not yet sent it. The Director of the Public Works Bureau then stated that, in his position, it was not appropriate to add criticism to Hill's expert report. However, if the Committee allowed it, he could also present his views to the General Manager's Office, but please do not regard it as criticism. This proposal was agreed to by the members. Subsequently, it was resolved that the Investigation Committee should give final consideration to the report and report to the Board of Directors on whether it can be adopted in whole or in part. This motion has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Road Cleaning Matters. The Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau has now replaced the street sweeping and watering carts with automobiles. The water consumption last year reached more than 36 million gallons. In addition, in order to transport garbage (about 1,000 tons per day), automobiles are now also used due to the large amount of material and the long distances. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau now has five water carts, forty street sweeping carts, and twelve ditch mud carts that are no longer needed, as well as various saddle accessories, and is inviting people to purchase them.</p>
<p>Director Fukushima Resigns. At the Board of Directors meeting on Wednesday, Chairman Bell reported that Mr. Fukushima had resigned from his position as a Director of the Bureau due to his transfer to Tokyo, and praised Mr. Fukushima for his contributions to the Bureau's affairs. Mr. Fukushima then rose to express his thanks and hoped that the spirit of cooperation in the Bureau would continue forever, so that Shanghai would become more prosperous. The Chairman then stated that Mr. Fukushima's vacancy would be filled by a public election by the Board of Directors. It is heard that Mr. Terai Hisanobu, the manager of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, is a person of high repute among the Japanese residents. Therefore, it was resolved to invite Mr. Terai to join the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>New Western School. The Education Committee of the Public Works Bureau met on May 11th to discuss the issue of building a new Western school on Yuyuan Road. The Director of the Public Works Department stated that if a school building capable of accommodating 500 students is to be built, it would not be compatible with the current temporary school building. He suggested building a two-story building that can accommodate a maximum of 350 students, at a cost of 250,000 taels. The Director of Finance agreed with this idea, but said that plans for cutting off the roof should be prepared for the possibility of adding a floor in the future. The Director of the Public Works Department then said that the possibility of adding a floor or adding a wing would be taken into account during the design. The Committee then resolved to follow the Director's proposal and request him to plan a school building that can accommodate 350 people at a cost of 250,000 taels. This proposal has also been approved by the Board of Directors. Regarding the issue of admitting Chinese students to the school, the Education Committee advocated that, after the school building is completed, Chinese students can also be admitted in special circumstances and when there are vacancies. This proposal was also approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Sewing for a Living, Died from Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Zhu Chenshi, a 42-year-old woman from Huzhou who lived at No. 3, Xinxin Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road, went to Room 34 of the Qianqin Hostel on Tianjin Road alone at about 3:00 pm on the 17th of this month, secretly took opium and committed suicide. The next morning, the tea servant Yang Ashou discovered it and immediately reported it to the relevant General Patrol Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The woman was taken to the hospital for treatment, but she died. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Wei Ligong and secretary Wang Zuyi, went to the autopsy room to examine the body. According to the son of the deceased, Zhu Shengsan, 15 years old, who lives with relatives in Ximen and is currently studying, he only learned about his mother's suicide yesterday. He stated that his family consists of only his mother and himself, and his father has passed away. His mother usually sews clothes for a living. This time, she suddenly took poison, which he believed was due to economic difficulties. Mr. Guo then announced that the deceased Zhu Chenshi had indeed died from opium poisoning before her death. The body was handed over to the son of the deceased, Zhu Shengsan, for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Zhang Baoqing, Martial Arts Expert, to Perform Soon <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Baoqing, a world-renowned martial arts expert, and his National Development Technical Troupe, were once rumored to come to Shanghai to perform. However, more than a month has passed, and there is still no news of the location and date of Mr. Zhang's performance. According to someone close to Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang did not intend to perform in Shanghai this time. Mr. Zhang recently returned to China from Russia and intends to organize a purely Chinese circus. He has purchased more than 20 well-trained horses, which are still in Qingdao. Mr. Zhang plans to find a suitable location in Shanghai and then start preparing the circus. Therefore, he has politely declined all requests from theaters to perform his martial arts. Later, a certain gentleman who promoted martial arts and Mr. Zhang became very close. In view of the daily pressure from foreign powers, he believed that if the Chinese people want to strengthen their physique, the promotion of martial arts is urgent. If Mr. Zhang has amazing skills and does not show them to the public, it will not only bury a good method, but also hinder the promotion of martial arts. Therefore, he urgently begged Mr. Zhang to perform. Now, Mr. Zhang has agreed and is scheduled to perform for three days at the Summer Peck Theater starting next Thursday.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Pay Attention When Riding the Tram <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhongchang Falls off the Platform and Dies</p>
<p>Chen Zhongchang, a 24-year-old man from Ningbo, took Tram No. 39 on Line 6 of the French Tramway Company in the Lujiawan area of the French Concession on the afternoon of the 18th to the 16th Pier. Because there were many people, he stood on the platform outside the car. When the car passed the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road, somehow the tram door suddenly opened, causing Chen to fall off the car and faint. The car stopped immediately, and the driver and conductor tried to revive him and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they recorded the number and reported it to the patrolman. Chen suffered a severe head injury and died in the hospital that night after ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Room. Yesterday, the Vehicle Department reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Wu accompanied the forensic doctor to the autopsy room to examine the body. The family member, Chen Fang, from the same clan, arrived and stated that the family members were currently in their hometown and had been notified by telegram. He could take responsibility for collecting the body. The official announced that Chen Zhongchang had indeed died from injuries sustained from the fall before his death. The body was allowed to be collected and buried by Chen Fang after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Verdict Announced in the Red Pill Smuggling Case <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Boy from Ningbo Acquitted and Released</p>
<p>A Zhou family in No. 60 Ximen Road, French Concession, privately set up a red pill manufacturing facility. Between the 11th and 13th of this month, they used a boy from Ningbo, Xu Jincheng, to falsely claim that he was sending 62 packages of printed matter from the Shanghai Huibao Bookstore, containing more than 100,000 red pills, to the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road for delivery to Xuzhou. This was discovered by Gao, the postal inspector of the post office, who reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese Detective Shi Enjian and Western Detective Hai Er went to arrest the Xu boy. After questioning, they learned that Lou Zhitian from Nanjing, who was among the packages at the General Post Office, and Liu Desheng, a local hired hand at the Xiafei Road branch in the French Concession, were both accomplices. They then arrested Lou and Liu. The main culprit, Zhou, could not be found. The police station sent Lou, Liu, and the Xu boy to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The debate has concluded, and the verdict is awaited. Yesterday morning, the case reached the date for the verdict to be announced. Lawyer Liang Bohua, representing the Xu boy, also waited at the Gao Yi Court for instructions. Judge Qiao Wanxuan presided over the court and ruled that Lou Zhitian was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 600 yuan for the crime of intending to sell and jointly transport opium substitutes. Liu Desheng was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan for the crime of intending to sell and jointly transport opium substitutes. If the fine is commuted to imprisonment, it will be calculated at a rate of three yuan per day. Before the judgment is finalized, the number of days of detention will be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days per day. The 62 packages of red pills were confiscated. Xu Jincheng was found not guilty. Lawyer Zhang of the police station waived the appeal, and he was released immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Jiangsu Department of Education <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Improving Social Education in Various Counties</p>
<p>The principle of the organization is to use fewer personnel to do more work.</p>
<p>The focus of the work is literacy education and livelihood education.</p>
<p>Jiangsu's social education has been painstakingly developed over the past few years, and a basic framework has been established. After Director Zhou arrived at the Department, he actively promoted it, dividing the entire province into several mass education areas based on the autonomous regions stipulated in the county organization law. A mass education center or a farmer education center is established in each area as the central organization for implementing mass education, and implementation standards are formulated as the basis for the work. Recently, feeling that the past achievements were biased towards theoretical components and had little direct relationship with the actual life of the masses, and that the various social education organizations had failed to tighten their organizations and concentrate their efforts, another key point for the reorganization and promotion of social education in various counties has been formulated. Observing its emphasis, the principle of the organization is to use fewer personnel to do more work, and the focus of the work is literacy education and livelihood education. It is even more obvious that its plan is perfect, and the future results can be expected. The original text of its reorganization and promotion points is also attached below.</p>
<p>Key Points for Reorganization and Promotion of Social Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>1. Social education funds in various counties must strictly comply with repeated orders and documents, and absolutely not be moved or misappropriated. 2. Various social education organizations should tighten their organizations, based on the principle of using fewer personnel to do more work. From the 21st year onwards, the standards for the distribution of funds for various organizations must uniformly comply with Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations for Mass Education Centers promulgated by the Ministry of Education, which stipulates that salary costs shall not be higher than 50%, operating expenses shall not be lower than 40%, and office expenses shall account for 10%. 3. Various social education organizations should strive to eliminate excessive expenditures and avoid facilities that do not meet the urgent needs of the masses. All service personnel should concentrate all their efforts on engaging in active work and delving into the people, so that social education organizations have a direct relationship with the actual life of the masses. 4. Various social education organizations should focus on implementing literacy education and livelihood education, striving to reduce illiteracy and improve the lives of the masses. 5. Various social education organizations should cooperate with relevant organizations in the local area. If there are agricultural improvement organizations near the farmer education center, they must especially try to contact them and jointly promote livelihood education to increase the effectiveness of both parties' work. 6. Mass schools and literacy classes should be set up as much as possible. In areas where the class system is not applicable for teaching, literacy centers and question centers should be widely established, and mobile teaching methods should be adopted to replace them. 7. Public sports fields should also conduct various recreational activities with educational meaning to attract a large number of people and enable them to benefit both physically and mentally. 8. Libraries should provide more charts on national disasters and national humiliations to arouse the excitement of the masses. 9. Various social education facilities should pay attention to the universality of various places, promote utilization, and use mobile methods such as mobile libraries and mobile lecture groups, and make good use of business equipment such as instruments, specimens, models, and sports equipment, so that they are not merely display items. 10. Various social education organizations should prepare two copies of the monthly work report form and submit them to the Bureau for verification, and add an opinion to one copy and keep it in the Bureau. One copy must be submitted to the Department for review by the Bureau before the 5th of each month, and must not be delayed. 11. The diligence and laziness of the staff of various social education organizations should be thoroughly investigated by the Education Bureau and reported to the Department at any time for commendation and punishment.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education Promulgates the Outline of Elementary School Work During the War</p>
<p>Teachers and Students from Colleges and Universities Join Frontline and Rear Support Work</p>
<h3 id="e178">Twelve Elementary School Training Instructions <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>To complete the plan of jointly facing the national crisis, and to achieve the long-term effects of resistance, we must engage in the training of elementary school students who are the next generation of citizens. Elementary school students who have personally experienced the Shanghai crisis and suffered oppression from the enemy, should especially have special stimulation to leave a particularly deep impression in their young minds. We see that the city's education department issued a "General Outline of Elementary School Work During the War Period" in February, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau ordered all elementary schools under its jurisdiction to say: How should teachers and students of all elementary schools in our city be inspired by the enemy's invasion of Shanghai and our army's resistance to foreign aggression? According to the fearless spirit of the Premier, we will act as a backing for our soldiers at the front. At this critical moment of national survival, we should all do our best to jointly face the national crisis, so the following general outline of work is formulated: First, hold a daily self-reflection meeting, the method is as follows: (1) Hold it every morning, half an hour before the start of classes. (2) The principal convenes faculty, staff and children to attend. (3) The ceremony is as follows: A. Perform the ceremony as usual. B. The whole body recites the patriotic creed. The patriotic creed is that an enemy is attacking our Shanghai and wants to destroy our Republic of China (1) We are willing to swear to never buy Japanese goods (2) We are willing to be the backing of the soldiers at the front. (3) We are willing for all the people of the country to unite as one. (4) We are willing to do our best to save the country (5) We are willing to die rather than be slaves of a subjugated country. C. The chairman reports on current events. D. Self-reflection, silence, and the following self-reflection: (1) If there were no troops of ours resisting the enemy in front today, could we be here in peace and stability in class? (2) Our troops are at the</p>

<p>front line killing the enemy, how hard are they working? How should we elementary school students study hard in the rear? Are there banquets and entertainment that forget the national crisis? (3) How should we firmly remember this enemy's atrocities? E. Students automatically express their opinions on saving the country, two people each time, limited to five minutes per person. F. The chairman summarizes the students' opinions on saving the country and draws conclusions. Second, train children to be frugal in clothing and food, save money to save the country, and students in each school should set up savings boxes at home to save pocket money and put it into the savings box or deposit it in the bank. This kind of savings still belongs to the children themselves, and when necessary, it can be taken out to donate to the national crisis or used for national construction. Third, the curriculum should fully accommodate, and prepare for patriotic spirit, national consciousness and practical work. Fourth, pay special attention to physical exercise. Fifth, pay special attention to the study of the geography of the war zone and its relationship with the industry and commerce of this city. Sixth, hold exercises to avoid disasters (airplanes, bullets, poison gas, etc.) and practice first aid skills. Seventh, guard the rear and respond to the national army, police and defense forces (each school should think about its own environment, lead students, and convene student families to inform them when necessary). The above tasks should be inspected and guided by the Social Affairs Bureau at any time, in order to complete the education sector's plan to jointly face the national crisis as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Thirteen Teachers and Students Enlist <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Schools don't have classes, students don't study, and teachers don't teach. Logically, teachers and students can enjoy a leisurely and carefree life outside of school, enjoying the sweet freedom that is hard to come by. However, when the enemy's war drums are shaking the ground, how can they enjoy an ideal life? If you live in Shanghai during the war, you will definitely see or hear countless teachers and students busier than the bees in spring, serving in the front and rear. At least one-fifth of the university volunteers abandoned their pens and joined the army, aiming to kill the enemy and become a pillar of the country. The student volunteers in the rear are also eager to fight the enemy. Even students from Columbia University and other universities across the ocean have requested to return to China to join the army. Xu Jiaxin, a bachelor of literature from St. John's University, disregarded his family and went to the front line to serve. Countless other young people cut off their fingers to join the army. Such a tragic and enthusiastic scene is truly moving and praiseworthy. Female students from Great China University, Fudan University, and Sino-French Pharmaceutical University volunteered to take care of wounded soldiers. More than 600 students from Tongji University formed a nursing team, led by team leader Dai Ruxin, and set off for the front line on February 1. More than 180 students from Central University Medical School, Aurora Medical School, and Sino-French Medical School organized a "Wartime Medical Affairs Federation," and appointed Ren Tinggui as the team leader to go to Zhabei on February 3 to rescue wounded soldiers. Aurora University has transformed its entire school into a hospital for wounded soldiers, and all medical affairs are handled by the school's doctors. The rescue team of the University Federation and the battlefield service team of China Public School are all working enthusiastically. Shi Yixuan, a teacher from Patriotic Girls' High School and Jianguo High School, also serves as the director of medical affairs at the Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road in Zhabei. During the smoke of war, he worked day and night to diagnose and treat wounded soldiers. For several days when traffic was cut off, he stayed in the hospital alone, working diligently. When there was no food or tea, he injected a tonic and drank beef juice to maintain his energy and continue working. When the enemy saw wounded soldiers being transported to the hospital, their planes would track them down. Often, at the critical moment of removing bullets and bandaging wounds, enemy planes would drop bombs on the hospital with a bang. To this day, you can see the walls of the hospital and the surrounding area riddled with holes like a honeycomb left by bullets. According to military experts, the mortality rate of soldiers who die from bullets on the battlefield is not high. More people die after being injured due to lack of treatment or delayed surgery than those who die in battle from bullets. Therefore, the rescue work of teachers and students is equivalent to adding many experienced reinforcements, indirectly protecting the country.</p>
<p>Lu Jinhou, a professor at Great China University, was originally a poor scholar. He actually rented a house at No. 570 Xujiahui Road at his own expense and opened a "Wartime School for Displaced Students." Not only did he take care of them without charging a penny, but he also invited scholars to give academic lectures in the morning and practiced wartime military training in the afternoon, just like a wartime school. The Middle School Federation, Great China Middle School, Overseas Chinese Middle School, and the Shanghai Education Circle Patriotic Federation, etc., handled refugee relief affairs in the rear. Jinrong Elementary School also funded the vaccination of refugees, distributed medicinal water and soap, and extended medical treatment, etc., treating refugees like their own children.</p>
<p>Almost all girls' schools are busy making masks, sewing silk cotton vests, tailoring clothes and pants, etc., to donate for military use. The Middle School Federation proposed a national salvation fund of 2,000 yuan to reward loyal and brave soldiers. Chizhi, Bowen, Minzhi, Fazheng, Minli, Jiaotong and other schools donated money to purchase telescopes, goggles, food, etc. to comfort the soldiers. The University Professors Anti-Japanese Association purchased food and sent five directors to comfort the hardworking soldiers.</p>
<p>The University Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation sent a telegram to university students in various countries on February 18, announcing the crimes of the enemy. University student representatives participated in inquiries from all walks of life asking why the Public Concession allowed the Japanese army to occupy the concession and stage the tragedy of killing and arson. The University Professors' Association telegraphed foreign countries to disclose the truth and asked to uphold justice. There is so much work they are doing, but I can't remember many of them for a while. Writing casually, I didn't realize the length of the article was very long. I won't repeat it anymore. In short, we see that teachers and students from various schools are so selfless and sacrificing themselves to save the country, we have to learn from Liang Qichao's old saying, "China will never perish." And please forward it to the whole country, but I am worried that China is multi-faceted, such as floods and banditry, and I am deeply afraid that transportation will be inconvenient and delivery will be difficult, and please instruct the responsible agency to contact.

<p>(Li Yingong)</p>
<p>(4) Why does the profit-making business still depend on the provincial treasury for funding?</p>
<p>(Answer) Although, there is a saying for this. I remember when Yingong took office, he mentioned that in three to five years, it would not be difficult to first achieve self-sufficiency, and then gradually expand the profits. Now, please allow me to finish my saying. If you want to achieve self-sufficiency, you have to have a way to achieve self-sufficiency. In other words, such as changing the behavior of conservatism, no longer seeking to increase the area year by year, each area only needs to set up a small number of workers and police, the distribution of patrol, a few areas set up a branch of staff, round the supervision, it is also enough to be proud. Now, the education forest is not the case, divided into six main areas, and six or seven sub-areas, all have extensive nurseries, in recent years, the addition of Baixiaoling Sunjiagui's tomb village and other promotion areas, are actively building, in order to be able to develop a point, then let go to do it, to seed breeding, year-old planting volume is considerable, that is, to this year's spring planting, the preparation of seedling volume, is also not less than 6.5 million, absolutely no one purchased from abroad, when it comes to funding, (regardless of regular temporary,) Yingong in office three years and eleven months, the savings of nearly 10,000 yuan, so in all provincial or central agencies owe funding and three or four months, the forest business has never been subject to economic pressure, a slight pause, in addition to the safekeeping of a reforestation reserve of 6,486 yuan and 7 cents and 7 cents, and the 20th year of regular fees from July 20 to the end of February 21, all eight months of savings, and old received and not received four and a half months of funding, transferred to the post-appointment, dare to say that for the provincial money, has not been extravagant, income for another, although from by-products, after all, belongs to the nature of the provincial education fund, special fold to save, has not been used, now also a special project handover, post-appointment takeover, or from this year's income will increase sharply, enough to satisfy the aspirations of the group, the expectation is also,</p>
<p>In addition to this, misunderstandings may still be inevitable, which is not known by me, and why use the continuous non-stop as, leave this to replace the white face, that is, please Jiangsu people public Jian,</p>

<h3 id="e196">Securities and Bond Prices Fluctuated <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The transaction amount was 2.4 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 19th), the market conditions of various bond markets at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, although there were still many spot offerings, the transaction volume was small, totaling only 35,000 yuan. The futures market was also not as good as before, and the inflows and outflows in the market were slightly sparse. In the morning, there were still over 1.4 million transactions, but only 900,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Among them, the "20" customs and unified salt tax each accounted for about 400,000, and the others were around 200,000. The "96" complete six customs duties and demobilization were relatively clear. As for the price trend of each bond, due to no new changes in the situation of all parties and a calm environment, the market sentiment also turned to wait-and-see, and the supply and demand situation was balanced. Therefore, each price entered a hovering state without major fluctuations. The price of each bond fluctuated only two or three jiao throughout the day. As a result, compared with the previous day, there were mutual rises and falls, and the number was only between two and three jiao. Only the customs duties spot rose by eight jiao compared with Tuesday. Observing the situation of the bond market, judging from the current environment, a huge increase is not allowed by the situation, but it will not have huge ups and downs. In the near future, there will be no major changes.</p>

<p>Report from the American Eastern Silver Company</p>
<p>The market was initially stable on Wednesday, but the selling pressure gradually intensified later, and the price trended downward. After hearing the news that "American Telegraph and Telephone" continued to distribute dividends as usual, the market sentiment eased slightly, so the later market was able to stabilize. The total trading volume for the day was only 700,000 shares. Industrial stocks fell by 1.20 pounds. Copper mines and automobile stocks remained firm. Due to the fact that the production rate of the American Steel Company had reached 25% last week, its stock value remained stable. However, it also fell by three-quarters of a pound at the closing. The overall trend of steel stocks was generally downward, because the production rates in various regions varied greatly, averaging about 25%. Gasoline stocks were also not very good. Mobil fell by 0.5, and Texaco fell by 0.25. The reason for the decline in industrial stocks was mostly due to the fact that the production rate of the power industry decreased by 13.1% compared with the same period last year. Although "American Telegraph and Telephone" was about to distribute dividends, its stock still fell by 1.25 pounds. The Dow Jones daily index is attached as follows:</p>

<p>The yarn market is sluggish, and the situation is exceptionally clear and weak. Actual sales are even more stagnant, and all sectors lack vitality. Because various parties previously increased their purchases significantly, it is currently difficult for silver to be fully accessible, and the purchasing power has naturally decreased. Moreover, war clouds are spreading in the northeast, and the 共匪 are rampant in Fujian and Zhejiang. There is little hope for current sales, so most people are psychologically bearish. However, the price of marked yarn is already lower than that of actual yarn, so although the pressure is heavy, the downward trend is still light. It is still a kind of stagnant and wooden circling situation. In short, the overall situation is not good, and optimism about the future is rare.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Cotton Standard Is Stagnant <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>In the early market, American cotton recovered by 10 points, and the sentiment was slightly firm. However, trading in the market was greatly lacking. Each month rose slightly by 3, 4, and 5 qian. The market sentiment was even more scattered in the afternoon, and there was even less trading in the market. Each month fell back by 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 3,100 bales. It was found that Shenji sold 150 bales, Xiesheng sold 350 bales, and Jifeng sold 150 bales. Dachang bought 350 bales, Changfeng bought 400 bales, and Yuanda bought 150 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>The sales of actual yarn are still sluggish. It was found that the total number of bales bought by each sector for the day was only 350 bales. The market price fell by 5 qian to about 1 liang. Customer sectors in the interior bought 173 bales, Guangdong bought 10 bales, Ningbo bought 3 bales, fellow traders bought 45 bales, Southeast Asia bought 30 bales, Yunnan bought 40 bales, Xuzhou bought 35 bales, and Zhenjiang bought 10 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market has risen slightly. As American cotton has recovered again and the price of gold has also risen, the sentiment of some people is firmer. However, the overall situation is still weak. Because the silver plate for calculating the price of foreign cotton is still cheap, and various foreign firms have extremely flat intentions, they are quite willing to compromise on the price of cotton and are eager to find a way out. However, the absorption of foreign cotton by various factories is already full, and the amount of imports is very shallow, so the trading volume of spot goods is lacking.</p>

<p>In the early market, the Zheng Standard market opened, and the market sentiment was slightly tight due to the rise in foreign cotton. Each month rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. The market was flat in the afternoon. The total transaction volume for the day was 3,600 dan. It was found that Yongda sold 200 dan, Yicheng sold 200 dan, Dafeng sold 300 dan, and Hengyi sold 200 dan. Jifeng bought 900 dan, Changji bought 200 dan, and Changhe bought 300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm and stable due to the poor harvest, with fellow traders buying in and a lack of sellers. It is estimated that futures rose by 8 to 9 points, and spot goods rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 23 points, and spot goods fell by 7 points.

<p>Foreign Seed Silkworms in Nanxun Also Undergoing Changes</p>
<p>Early Silkworms on the Scaffolds Are Severely Affected by Thunderstorms and Rain</p>
<p>Nanxun has always been a famous silk area. In recent years, silkworm farmers have believed in foreign seeds (i.e., improved varieties). This year, farmers have abandoned local varieties and do not raise them. However, the weather has not been right. The climate has been cold and hot after flowering, coupled with continuous overcast and rainy days. Not only is the development of silkworms slow, but also silkworm farmers are very difficult to feed leaves. There has been quite a lot of loss in the middle of the big sleep. The early silkworms have already been on the scaffolds. Unexpectedly, the torrential rain and thunder the other day, coupled with the sultry heat, caused the silkworms on the scaffolds to stop spinning due to hearing the sound of thunder, resulting in stiff and dead silkworms. Even the late silkworms in the middle of the big sleep have also developed diseases such as vomiting black and diarrhea. This year's silkworm harvest has also been a disappointment.</p>

<p>Lower Than Last Year by 70-80 Taels</p>
<p>Qimen black tea, which has attracted attention from China and abroad, finally broke the deadlock of dense clouds but no rain yesterday at 5:00 PM. The first transaction was made by Zhongxinchang and Gongshengyong two tea shops with the German firm Xingcheng Foreign Company. The price of upper and middle grade goods opened at 210 taels, and the price of middle grade goods opened at 180 taels. According to the average comparison of goods prices, it was lower than last year by 70 to 80 taels. Subsequently, the British firm Jardine Matheson also continued to search for and handle goods. However, because it was late, most other traders were unable to catch up. Currently, foreign exchange rates have recovered, and the price of silver has turned down. The London-bound ship Ajax has been scheduled to depart on the 22nd, and the ship schedule is urgent. It is expected that the Qimen tea market will have a special development today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, about 27 or 28 rice boats from various sectors sailed to South Shanghai. The situation was in a slump. Changshu and Wuxi's top goods were fixed, and the second goods were weak by one or two jiao. The middle-grade goods were also short by one jiao. The early and late rice arrived and sold evenly, and the market was soft by nearly a jiao. The transaction of Luyang sharp rice was very small, and it also tended downstream. Bianyinyuan arrived and sold as soon as it arrived, and the market was neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 30 boats arrived from the northern roads. The opening of each cargo was still lonely. The top-grade goods in Changzhou and Wuxi recovered and weakened, and the middle-grade goods were short by about two jiao. The Jiangyin and Su-Tong japonica rice were each lower by one jiao. The Luyang sharp rice, 埠尖, and three types of customer help had some business, and the situation was hard. The Bianyinyuan teahouses handled hundreds of stones, and the price rose by a jiao compared to the previous.</p>

<p>Currently, Foreign Rice Is Very Popular in the Interior</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market initially rose and then flattened, and the market settled. In the morning, due to the great demand from the interior helping to handle goods, the market had an upward trend. Subsequently, foreign firms vigorously peddled futures, and 1,500 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice for shipment in the second half of June were traded with the market. It was thrown out by Chanson, and the 本街 received it. The price opened at 5 taels 4 qian 5 ban for long grain, and 5 taels 5 qian 5 ban for round grain. In the near term, the 本街 sold 1,000 bags of Min Dang road goods for 10 days on consignment, priced at 11 yuan. After this batch was sold, the market was quite affected. Fuchia Foreign Firm also had 4,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 for peddling, asking for 5 taels 4 qian for long grain and 5 taels 4 qian 5 ban for round grain. However, due to the deposit relationship, there was no transaction on the day. 12,000 bags of small twisted rice were opened for spot goods, priced at 10 yuan 6 jiao 5 ban to 10 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen, and 300 bags of small twisted coarse rice, priced at 9 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen. 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at 11 yuan 7 jiao 5 ban, all of which were handled by various interior helpers. The 本街 only handled over 200 bags of Jiangxi Machine Yuan rice, priced at 14 yuan 3 jiao 5 ban.</p>

<p>本街 Hoards and Buys Later</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly turned around due to purchases by Southeast Asian helpers. If there are continued disposals in the future or there are further inquiries from the northern helpers, the market should be able to stand up. Moreover, it is reported that Soviet Russia has military operations, and Japan is also eager to try. If a world war becomes a reality, then flour, wheat, and miscellaneous grains may all surge. Yesterday, customer helpers purchased first, and the 本街 hoarded and inquired later. The 本街 navy ships for this month closed at 2 liang 0 fen 2 li ban to 2 liang 0 fen 3 li ban. The old truck brand closed at 2 liang 0 fen 4 li 25, which was 1 fen 5 and 1/2 higher than the closing price of the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Ma Xianglao's Four Non-Deaths <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zongxian</p>
<p>The esteemed Ma Xiangbo, a man of great virtue and scholarship, is admired by all. Now at the age of ninety-three, his spirit is vigorous, resembling that of a man in his sixties or seventies. We can certainly wish him well for his upcoming centennial celebration. However, in his youth, Mr. Ma also faced many trials. I respectfully recount several events, purely as casual conversation.</p>
<p>(I) Revived from Death at Age Four: From birth, the Honorable Mr. Ma displayed intelligence. Even in his earliest attempts at speech, his words were extraordinary. At the age of four, he fell seriously ill and passed away. His father happened to be away from home. The family prepared the coffin but had not yet placed him inside. Upon returning, his father was overcome with grief, holding the child and unable to let go. Suddenly, Mr. Ma awoke as if from sleep and said, "Father, I am not dead. I must accomplish something before I die." To this day, Mr. Ma's endeavors have benefited the nation. Could this be the fulfillment of those words?</p>
<p>(II) Nearly Drowned at Age Nine: In the twenty-eighth year of Daoguang (1848), there was a great flood. The water rose to the rooftops. Mr. Ma, unfazed, found it amusing and sat on the upper floor, soaking his feet, wiggling his toes with delight. Suddenly, he slipped and fell into the water. His mother heard the splash and rushed over, quickly throwing him a pole. Mr. Ma grabbed it and was pulled out, gasping for air, complaining of swallowing too much water.</p>
<p>(III) Nearly Died from a Fall at Age Thirteen: From a young age, the Honorable Mr. Ma revered the Holy Mother. August 15th was traditionally the "Feast of the Assumption" in the church. The day before, Mr. Ma and several young classmates went to the church to help prepare the decorations in celebration. The colorful decorations in the hall were high up, and no one dared to climb. Mr. Ma, full of courage, ascended to the highest point when suddenly he, along with the ladder, toppled over. He remained unconscious for several hours. His survival was truly divine intervention.</p>
<p>(IV) Recovery from a Serious Illness at Age Twenty-Two: By this time, Mr. Ma had entered the Jesuit seminary at Tushanwan in Xuhui, forsaking worldly affairs. Overwork led to illness, and he refused to eat for forty days. He was on the verge of death, with little hope of recovery. His father went to see him but was stopped at the door, standing there weeping. Mr. Ma, in his sickbed, faintly heard what sounded like his father's voice. He thought to himself, "If I die, how can my poor father bear it?" In that moment, the doctor happened to come for a checkup and was greatly surprised, noting an improvement from the previous day. Alas, the recovery from his illness was likely due to this filial piety moving the heavens. After recovering, all his hair fell out, and for a year, he could not recognize the words he read. One can imagine the severity of his illness. The above was personally narrated to me by the Honorable Mr. Ma. He stroked his beard, sat upright, and spoke with great relish. It is a pity that my writing skills are insufficient to fully capture the spirit of his account.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Random Notes from Chang'an <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of Japanese aggression, the government, for the sake of long-term resistance, moved the capital to Luoyang and also proposed a secondary capital in Chang'an. Consequently, officials thronged the Longhai Road, and the declining Qin region suddenly showed signs of vitality. I am a native of Chang'an, and although I have been away from home for a long time, the scenery of my hometown remains in my mind. Now, I will describe what I remember for the readers.</p>
<p>The City Walls of Chang'an are the Second Strongest in the Country: Chang'an is a historically important place. The Zhou, Qin, and Tang dynasties all established their capitals here. The strength and grandeur of the city walls are second only to those of Beiping. The walls are more than ten zhang (about 33 meters) high and several zhang wide, allowing two carriages to drive side by side. Therefore, during the Bingyin Incident (1926), the Shaanxi army relied on them to hold out for eight months. The largest buildings within the city are the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, with their carved beams and painted rafters towering into the clouds. These are remnants of the ancient imperial practice of ringing the bell in the morning and beating the drum at dusk. Now, the sound of the drum can no longer be heard, but the bell is still used on time. The sound of the bell is loud and clear, and can be heard throughout the city. ▲ Surrounded by Mountains, the Scenery is Beautiful: Chang'an is built on a plain, surrounded by the Zhongnan Mountains, making the scenery particularly secluded. The most famous sights are "Hua Mountain Immortal Palm," "Taibai Mountain Accumulated Snow," "Qujiang Stream Drinking," "Wild Goose Pagoda Morning Bell," "Ba River Willow Wind and Snow," "Thatched Cottage Misty Clouds," "Li Mountain Evening Glow," and "Xianyang Ancient Ferry." People in the Ming Dynasty even compiled a list of the Eight Views of Chang'an. Even now, during good days in spring and autumn, scholars and women still often rely on these poems to guide their sightseeing.</p>
<p>Rich in Historical Sites and Strong Folk Customs: Chang'an City has a wealth of historical sites, such as the "Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall," "Public Library," and "Stele Forest," which contain many inscriptions, historical records, and rare treasures. However, these are only for public viewing. The number of artifacts in private collections is also large. Local customs are simple and frugal, but people are extremely sensitive to insults. Therefore, there is a saying among the people: "Not afraid of wolves, not afraid of dogs, but afraid of insults." I remember when Kang Youwei went to Shaanxi, a grand welcoming ceremony was held in the market of Chang'an. However, soon after, Kang was expelled by those who had welcomed him for defrauding Buddhist monks. Dai Jitao once said that the people of Shaanxi lived in caves and should have the "insect" radical added to their name. The people of Shaanxi had already heard of this remark. This time, when Dai Jitao went to Shaanxi, the citizens of Chang'an, in order to avenge the insult of the "insect" radical, not only beat him up but also destroyed his car. This is also one of the interesting anecdotes amid the talk of making it a secondary capital.</p>

<p>The British Patent Office registers the patent rights for new inventions. Recently, an interesting new invention was registered: a method to cure snoring after falling asleep.</p>
<p>In Cheshire, England, an unemployed young man, in order to make a living, specializes in applying gold paint to people's doorknobs to enhance their appearance. He charges a penny or two each time, a very low price. People are quite receptive, and business is good every day. ▲ The largest clock in London is on the bank of the Thames River, at the New Shell Mxx Building. The clock face is twenty-five feet in circumference, and the minute hand is eleven feet six inches long. It is powered by electricity and has a pleasing sound. ▲ A famous British hygienist claims that marriage can help prolong life. If a man marries at the age of twenty-seven, he has the hope of extending his life by forty-two years. However, a single man of the same age will live five years less.</p>

<p>The nation is in distress, and the government is vigorously encouraging the people to practice thrift in order to prepare for the needs of the resistance period. This is an important strategy for saving the country. A year or two ago, some newly rich individuals often spent money like water. Their clothing and living conditions exceeded those of the princes and nobles of the late Qing Dynasty. Their extravagance and licentiousness were fundamentally incompatible with the goals of the revolution. Mr. Sun Disan said that among the officials of the Republic of China, the one who truly practiced frugality was Zhang Nanxian, the former chairman of Zhejiang Province. He could live on two small silver coins a day. Ordinary civilians would find it difficult to live such a life. When he was in charge of Zhejiang, all his measures were based on reducing expenses. Although his political achievements are not discussed in detail, his simple and frugal lifestyle is admirable.</p>

<p>The Songjiang Woman: The Songjiang woman has thick, purple lips, and eyes like those of a goldfish. Sitting next to her is her son, about eleven or twelve years old. Perhaps due to heredity, his eyes and lips are exactly like his mother's. After the train passes Longhua, the rattling of the train windows is particularly loud. The train, like a wounded beast, plunges along the rusty tracks toward the green fields of early summer. At this moment, the ticket inspector begins checking tickets. The Songjiang woman, probably because her eyes protrude like those of a goldfish, spots him before anyone else. She quickly tells her son to hide behind her back, covering his feet with her clothes. The ticket inspector arrives, and the Songjiang woman pulls out a ticket for him to punch. When the train arrives in Songjiang, the woman and her son slip off the train like a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>The Madwoman: The train stops in Jiaxing. Two villagers carry a young woman onto the train. The young woman's face has two rosy patches, indicating that she still possesses the beauty of youth, but her hands are tied with rope. The two men carry her onto the train and throw her onto the seat like a piglet. The young woman meekly accepts her fate. When the train starts moving, the young woman sings a simple tune and waves her hands innocently. The passengers on the train surround her, mocking her, but she continues to sing and dance. According to the villagers who are watching her, she became like this from crying over the death of her mother.</p>
<p>A Dispute: A military police officer finds a man wearing a military uniform and asks him where he is from. The man in uniform takes a letter from his pocket, which proves that he is on extended leave, stamped with the seal of the ×× regiment. The military police officer looks at the letter and says sternly, "××, you have already taken leave, so you have become a civilian. You are not allowed to wear a military uniform. Take it off quickly."</p>
<p>"Comrade, I haven't received my salary for six months. What do you want me to wear if I don't wear my uniform?"</p>
<p>"I don't care what you wear. Anyway, you can't wear a military uniform." The military police officer's tone becomes even harsher.</p>
<p>"I made this uniform myself. I have no other clothes, so I have to wear it. I will go anywhere with you."</p>
<p>At this point, the situation is becoming somewhat tense. Fortunately, Hangzhou is approaching, and the military police officer says, "I won't argue with you now. We'll talk when we get off the train."</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Life of Dairen (Part 2) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Kaixu</p>
<p>Forty years ago, Mr. Dairen purchased a two-masted sailing ship named "NewsBoy." This was the beginning of Dairen Shipping.</p>
<p>From this humble beginning, day by day, month by month, it has grown into the Dairen Line, which holds the reins of the shipping industry in the Pacific today. Mr. Dairen first came to the Far East in 1901 and returned the following year. Later, the number of ships increased daily. Its most prosperous period was the fifteen years from 1915 to 1930. Now, it is still thriving and full of vigor. Mr. Dairen is now eighty-eight years old. The most amazing thing he has experienced in his life is the various inventions of modern science. He often says that forty years ago, if he wanted to communicate with the captain of a ship, he had to wait until the ship sailed into a port with telegraph service. Now, it is different. He can issue orders via radio at any time and receive a reply the next morning. He also often talks about Edison's first invention of the electric light. When he first heard about it in the newspaper, he absolutely did not believe it was possible and thought it was a deceptive rumor. He threw the newspaper into the wastebasket. Then he thought that Edison might not deceive his old friend, so he wrote to Edison, saying that if the news in the newspaper was not false, please send him a few first, and he would hang them in the lumberyard to see how strange they were. But Edison's reply was beyond Dairen's expectations. Edison said that if he wanted to light this lamp, he must first support it with iron wires around it and connect it to an electric current before it could emit light. When Dairen heard this, he burst out laughing, but he still did not know why. Mr. Dairen once wrote an autobiography, initially intending to give it only to relatives and friends. Later, he thought that his life's successful career might be helpful to young people, so he decided to publish it to the world. Mr. Dairen wrote in his autobiography, "I have come from poverty and humbleness to today all through hard work. People should all rise gradually from humbleness. Do not leapfrog. Do not skip grades. Their foundation will be solid. I ask myself, among the hardships suffered by young people, there are none greater than what I experienced in my childhood. I hope that young people will hear this and be inspired to fight. Do not be discouraged by small setbacks." Because Mr. Dairen did not forget his childhood hardships, he chartered a ship to his hometown of Foggike in Scotland one day. He returned and told people, "I wanted to find my old home, but there was nowhere to find it. The place has become a huge port with lumberyards everywhere. When I look at it, I see that pieces of wood are engraved with my name." Alas, Dairen, how great you are! All great men do not know the greatness of their cause. Only false great men proclaim themselves great.</p>

<p>A tea server named Tao from Shen Bao went to the Sihang Joint Savings Society Preparation Depository to cash checks for a certain gentleman yesterday afternoon after 4 pm. There were two ten-yuan checks and one five-yuan check. Tao mistakenly thought they were all five-yuan checks and went to the cash-out area of the depository and said to the clerk, Shen Junrongsheng, "I want to cash out fifteen yuan." At the time, Mr. Shen was busy with work and did not examine them carefully. He gave him fifteen yuan. After Tao returned and gave them to the gentleman, he discovered that ten yuan was missing. However, it was already late and he did not have time to ask. The next morning, Tao went to the depository again and said to Shen, "I am a tea server from Shen Bao. I came to your bank yesterday to cash a check. After returning, I found that I was short ten yuan. I don't know if it was lost at your bank." Mr. Shen asked him about the details. His language and expression were certainly not false. He immediately gave him ten yuan and earnestly instructed him to be more careful next time. Such a person like Mr. Shen is worthy of praise.</p>

<p>The fifth wife then instructed Deshun, "Very well, you should thank Miss Eight for the reward. Fortunately, Miss Eight is not an outsider. Back when my sisters and I were in that place, you carried the Yueqin and went out with us. You were only fourteen or fifteen years old then, and Miss Eight was very fond of you. In the future, when Mr. An's affairs are successful, you can ask Miss Eight to promote you more." Liang Xiaoyun said, "I wouldn't dare. I'm still relying on my older sister to take care of me, just like him." The fifth wife said, "It's not like that. By my side, he's just a small adjutant. If he wants a promising future, it's better to be a battalion or company commander in the army. That will depend on your promotion. Fortunately, there's no rush. We'll see what happens later." Liang Xiaoyun didn't say much more. After Deshun called the old nanny to join him in greeting and thanking her for the reward, they left. The fifth wife slipped on her slippers and saw them to the door, and also asked Deshun to accompany them to the gate. Liang Xiaoyun then got into the car and went back. In the car, he was very happy that things had gone smoothly today. But then he thought that he hadn't been with An Yutian for several hours. He wondered how he was at home. He felt very uneasy, as if he couldn't wait for the car to arrive in an instant. It would be good to see An Yutian's face soon. At this time, An Yutian had been living with her for three days and four nights. Since he personally urged him to move all his luggage from the public office to his home the day before yesterday, he had not let him go out alone. It was because of Li Wenxia's entanglement that he was afraid that he would still meet with Li Wenxia in private and be manipulated by Li Wenxia with some sad and affectionate words, arousing his old feelings and snatching him away from her, resulting in failure. In order to quickly determine the status of him and her as husband and wife, she forced him to draft a marriage announcement on the same day and send it to various newspapers to be published. The announcement also set the date for the third day. A simple ceremony was held at home. Close relatives and friends were not notified separately. On the day, he just made a few phone calls to gather some friends to make it lively. It happened that Wei Zhuomou had also come. She first announced to Wei Zhuomou and also asked Wei Zhuomou to be the witness. However, the matter about Li Wenxia was not concealed. She also asked Wei Zhuomou to persuade her in his spare time.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday, I talked about a "circular evolution," which reminded me of our country's evolution.</p>
<p>The Republic of China is more evolved than the Qing Dynasty, and the post-Republic of China is more evolved than the pre-Republic of China. Not only do we Chinese admit this, but even a few "gibberish-speaking" foreign gentlemen would probably admit it.</p>
<p>But when I look back and think about it, where is the evolution? Several foreign PhDs丨or maybe you don't need to go abroad, as long as you enter high school, or just cross the threshold of the university hall丨the clothes you wear must be foreign-made Western clothes, and the things used at home, if you step into a noble family, the room is decorated with strange and bizarre things, mostly foreign goods.</p>
<p>Even in this war, the enemy has airplanes, cannons, warships, and tanks, all fully equipped. And us? We only have a few new-style machine guns, rifles, etc., which are also bought with money from other countries. I ask, where is our country's evolution?</p>
<p>We have it! We have evolved! We have certainly evolved! We are busy dancing, busy watching movies, busy with public socializing, busy with mixed bathing for men and women, busy with free marriage and free divorce, especially modern girls, with strange clothes and ever-changing styles, and everything else has evolved in line with the trend of the times.</p>
<p>Besides that, where is the evolution?</p>

<p>Recently, I tried to manufacture several daily necessities and all were successful. Now, I dare not keep them secret, so I first select the easiest to manufacture, and those that are most likely to succeed, and write them below:</p>
<p>Prussian Blue Printing Water</p>
<p>Twelve parts distilled water, four parts glycerin, three parts alcohol, dozens of drops of acetic acid. Combine the above four ingredients, stir evenly with chopsticks, then add one part of extremely pure Prussian blue powder and mix well. It can be stored in a glass bottle. The most important thing to note is that the purer the chemicals used, the better the product will be. Acetic acid and Prussian blue powder must be selected from the best quality.</p>
<p>Peppermint Lozenges</p>
<p>Five ounces of camphor, half an ounce of menthol. Place them together in a coarse bowl and heat over a fire. After a while, the two substances will melt and mix. Then pour them into a mold and press them into shape. They are more effective than the peppermint lozenges sold on the market, because more menthol is used in this formula. Western pharmaceutical factories generally use this formula to make peppermint lozenges, but the market is full of Japanese goods, which sell widely because of their low price. However, they do not use much menthol. Therefore, because the raw materials are very expensive, Japanese goods are ultimately not good.</p>
<p>Glue</p>
<p>One hundred parts yellow gelatin (available in Chinese pharmacies, cheap, one copper coin can buy a stick), one hundred parts water, forty parts alcohol, ten parts vinegar, one part alum (pure). First, place the yellow gelatin and water in a bowl, steam until dissolved, and mix well. Then add the other ingredients.</p>

<p>— Qiqi</p>
<p>The other day, this publication had an article "The Level of University Students," which included "Several Answers from Transfer Students from a Certain University." It sounded very real, but a certain university would never ask "Who is Doihara?" or ask about Song Ziwen or Cai Yuanpei in its entrance exams for transfer students. So I think this author is a bit "comedic." Speaking of today's university students, there are indeed many who are unwilling to study hard, watching movies, dating, and going to dance halls. So yesterday, when our eighteen classmates had a meeting, I took the opportunity to present ten test questions as a fun activity and asked them to write down the answers on paper. The papers were all handed in within twenty minutes. They wrote very clearly, very detailed, and very interesting. Now I have revised and copied them down to introduce them to readers.</p>
<p>1. What are the five major theaters?</p>
<p>Answer: Nanjing, Xinguang, Guotai, Carlton, Guanglu.</p>
<p>2. What are the three major parks?</p>
<p>Answer: Zhaofeng Park, Hongkou Park, French Park.</p>
<p>3. The cause of Miss ×'s heartbreak.</p>
<p>Answer: The biggest reason is that her lover already loves someone else. The cause was on August 4, 1931, when Miss × was walking in the campus, eating peanuts, and happened to meet Mr. ×, who refused to give him a few peanuts. So the two started scolding each other. At the time, another couple was trying to reconcile them, but there were bound to be scars in their hearts. On December 17, it happened to be Sunday, at 7:13 pm, the two took a car to the ×× dance hall. At 12:35 am, Mr. × went crazy with joy and accidentally touched a glass with his arm. Coffee and tea spilled on Miss ×'s leather coat, stockings, and shoes. So the two started scolding each other again in the dance hall. From then on, Mr. × fell in love with another girl, and Miss × was heartbroken.</p>
<p>4. Who is the current queen of a certain girls' school?</p>
<p>Answer: ××× Ms. (All eighteen answered correctly).</p>
<p>5. What is the address of the ×× dance hall?</p>
<p>Answer: ××× Road, 1652. (Twelve answered correctly, four could not write the number, two only wrote the road name).</p>
<p>6. What is the purpose of university students living off-campus?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Freedom. Living off-campus, there is no hateful dormitory supervisor to prohibit us from singing loudly at night, and no other classmates to disturb our sweet love talk during the day. (2) Convenience. Off-campus, you can use electric fans in summer and rent electric stoves in winter, and you can also use electric kettles, etc., which is impossible on-campus. (3) Quiet. Sitting alone to write love letters, no classmates peep through the window, so you can write with peace of mind and not make mistakes, saving hundreds of sheets of stationery every month. There is no such quiet on-campus.</p>
<p>7. What is love-ism?</p>
<p>Answer: Love-ism is the only good medicine to save us university students from boredom, and it must be realized in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Answer: Love-ism is saving me-ism. (Seven people wrote this way.)</p>
<p>8. What are the Five Classics?</p>
<p>Answer: Love Classic, Eating Classic, Bible, Clothing Classic, Love Classic. (All eighteen answered correctly.)</p>
<p>9. Who is Qinni Gagno?</p>
<p>Answer: American movie queen.</p>
<p>10. What is Abandoned Woman?</p>
<p>Answer: It is the name of a sound film, starring Norma Shearer. It is very good. I have seen this film six times.</p>
<p>All eighteen papers were answered very well, and all could be scored from 90 to 100 points. It can be seen that university students can pass this type of common sense test.</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3 id="e224">Classmate's Sister-in-law <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, I visited my classmate, Ms. ×, and while we were chatting, she remembered something that I will write down below.</p>
<p>She said to me, "Sister Fang, my sister-in-law, was married to Mr. ×× of the Ministry of Education by my aunt last year. Their love was so intense that it could be said to have reached the boiling point. People often called them a perfect couple. Since the September 18th Incident, Mr. ×× has said to my sister-in-law, "Now the country has reached this point, and the government is holding on to the principle of non-resistance, giving the wealthy three northeastern provinces to others without any effort. Alas, with the country like this, what hope is there?"</p>
<p>My sister-in-law said, "Don't sigh here. The last hope of the country is the responsibility of the youth. So, if everyone is like you, not working hard to build strength, how can the country not perish?"</p>
<p>Mr. ×× said, "The reason why I don't serve on the front lines, sacrificing for the country and the nation, is that I can't forget you and a happy family." My sister-in-law said, "A man of great ambition should be in all directions. What can be missed by a woman and a family, shirking responsibility?" Their passionate words seemed to still be in my mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the January 28th Incident happened again. Mr. ×× was in Beijing researching his affairs. My sister-in-law did not hear the true news in advance, so she did not move to the concession. That night, she was awakened from her warm and sweet dream by the ruthless gunfire. She hurriedly fled to a remote place with Granny Li from next door. After many detours and the terror of the war, she was separated from Granny Li. Later, it was unknown whether she was buried by artillery fire or killed by enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I told Mr. ×× what Granny Li said, but I knew that he was not sad at all when he heard the news. At that time, my heart was filled with doubts. I thought, their love was so intense, how could he not be sad at all now? Later, I learned that after he went to Beijing, he met a girlfriend and went in and out of dance halls, movie theaters, fancy restaurants, and other happy places every day. How could he still remember his former wife?</p>
<p>Alas, society now is so dark. If we women are not careful, we will fall into a deep pit. Love and marriage are all cheating women, like fish greedy for a small bait and getting hooked. At this time, it is too late to repent. Women! Hurry up and go on the bright path.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Essays in the Popular Style <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Chang</p>
<p>After reading Buddhist Gentleman's "Essays in the Official Style," I thought of studying "Essays in the Popular Style." In an era of separation between the government and the people, each has its own style of writing.</p>
<p>The lingering poison of the eight-legged essay still exists today. Phrases like "Heaven sends disaster to China, foreign insults frequently arise..." are recited fluently by committee members and secretaries, who can produce such writings effortlessly. Whenever there is a slight change within the country, this type of rhetoric takes center stage. Telegrams and declarations are issued like a string of pearls, creating a great commotion.</p>
<p>The most amusing and incomprehensible thing is that, lacking funds to send telegrams, they advocate for so-called fashionable "express mail instead of telegram," which also becomes very popular.</p>
<p>This is a popular style essay influenced by officialdom.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Down with [Censored]</p>
<p>All circles unite to [Censored]</p>
<p>Support [Censored]</p>
<p>These are familiar and actively used formulas for our friends in the Republic of China. Even youngsters who haven't lost their baby teeth can manipulate a pen and fill in the "down with [Censored]" formula. Papers with phrases like "Heaven is high, Earth is wide, my family has a little boy..." often appear in the streets and alleys. These are probably sworn brothers of the "down with [Censored]" formulas, suitable for self-cultivation and managing the family.</p>
<p>The new generation of youth has grand visions and likes essays on governing the country and pacifying the world. The older generation has limited vision and likes essays on self-cultivation and managing the family. In short, these are all essays in the popular style.</p>

<p>"When the mind is unsettled, consult divination" is truly a matter of course.</p>
<p>When Wang San's job application fails, Li Si's illness shows no improvement, and Zhao Wu wants to take a concubine, these are the most delightful opportunities for Layman [Censored] and Taoist [Censored], and also the reason why the yellow-faced women in Buddhist temples wear joyful smiles.</p>
<p>"Good luck at [number] years old, check and deduct any arrears..."</p>
<p>"[Year] fleeting fortune, [deity] in charge..."</p>
<p>"The [number] spirit oracle stick. Upper-middle, middle-lower, upper-upper great auspiciousness."</p>
<p>This kind of cliché occupies an extremely large position in Chinese society and is also one of the essays in the popular style.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>"Refugee, [number] years old, family of five, fled in panic from the war zone..."</p>
<p>One can often see such refugees along Avenue Edward VII. Chalk is used to write formulaic essays on the ground, invariably saying "lonely and helpless..." unable to make a living... a family of five, old and young, relies entirely on the help of benevolent people..." So says person A, and so says person B. I don't understand why refugees fleeing the war zone are always families of five. Never four, and never six.</p>
<p>This is the fourth type of essay in the popular style.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Wang Jixu starves himself to save the nation, Zhang Xuewen commits suicide out of concern for the country. We, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, are truly capable of sacrifice, and incidents of martyrdom are common.</p>
<p>"Unable to bear to live selfishly in the face of national crisis... I wish my compatriots to unite and rise up to save the country" are excerpts from the posthumous writings of those who commit suicide or die for the nation.</p>
<p>The municipal government lacks funds and offers discounts on salaries, because "the national crisis is at hand." Person A and person B die for love, leaving a will saying "the national crisis is at hand." Even when an old couple quarrels, and one dies of anger, it can be said "the national crisis is at hand."</p>
<p>This is also one of the essays in the popular style.</p>

<p>"Dearest sister..." How sickening!</p>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to be a postal inspector, you will surely be able to read these gaudy and sickening words all day long. Perhaps Minister Chen advocates increasing postal rates, and this is one of the self-evident reasons.</p>
<p>Writing "Dearest..." is the only job of university students in the classroom. Reading "Dearest..." is the only pastime of middle school students in the toilet.</p>
<p>This is the sixth type of essay in the popular style.</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>(I) Dancers and Night Soil Collectors</p>
<p>Shanghai is spinning non-stop, with all kinds of people struggling to survive in all kinds of environments. Its superficial prosperity prevents tourists who first arrive on the Huangpu River from seeing the curses and sobs behind the scenes. Dancers and night soil collectors seek survival in completely different Shanghai environments. The former ends the Shanghai night, while the latter begins the Shanghai morning. In "Shanghai Life," I especially start with them to express the idea that Shanghai is spinning non-stop.</p>
<p>Under the ghastly green light, dancers spin under people's fetishistic psychology. They flaunt their coquettish eyes and trembling hips... satisfying the dance patrons who pay four dimes each time. The dance patrons' fetishistic psychology is further fueled by champagne - in other words, the temptation of money - to achieve a further purpose: to immerse themselves in a life of alcohol and lust with their flesh and blood in order to survive. They only end their previous day's life and get rest every early morning. When they are spewed out of the big buildings like demons, the night soil collectors also begin their day's work with their labor. They lack good nutrition and adequate sleep, and they come out from pigsty-like homes every day to work, then move their tired bodies back into the pigsties. Dancers, night soil collectors, and all human beings are struggling to survive in the spinning Shanghai life.</p>
<p>(II) Mr. Editor</p>
<p>Mr. Editor Wu Jin stepped into the writing room, looked at the piles of letters on the table, first squeezed his eyebrows and shook his head. The tea boy diligently brought him a plate of egg fried rice. He filled his stomach, lit a cigarette, reluctantly published the manuscripts, and prepared to go home early (his wife was sick), but the typesetter ran over and said that there were still a dozen lines of manuscript missing. He flipped through the incoming manuscripts, but none of them were suitable. He sat down and racked his brains, because he was focused on his wife at home, and he wrote a few lines of filler that were incoherent. He looked at the clock - twelve o'clock, still a few minutes short. A rickshaw pulled over on the desolate road, and you could clearly hear the sound of the rickshaw puller's feet hitting the asphalt road. Suddenly, a rush of sound came from behind. Wu Jin</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>couldn't help but be startled, thinking that the "skinning pig" gentleman had come to visit. He reluctantly calmed down, only to find that it was also a rickshaw chasing from behind, with a dancer with hedgehog-like hair sitting on it. Mr. Wu Jin secretly found it funny.</p>
<p>Walking into the bedroom, he saw his wife's pale face, her lips moving as if to say why he was so late. He picked up the thermos, which was empty. Returning at midnight and unable to get a cup of warm tea, Mr. Wu Jin wrote in his diary "...This hard editing job, I am determined to resign from tomorrow," and he wrote a letter of resignation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow came like today, and Mr. Wu Jin entered his writing room in the same way.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Selling Long Ingots <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>"Do you want long ingots! Selling long ingots!" A woman in rural attire called out in the alleys shrouded in the night.</p>
<p>The black lacquered doors of each house immediately opened, some calling to buy, others shouting to come over. You ten coppers, he eight coppers, and in no time, strings of paper ingots were sold out. The woman, carrying a rich harvest, left with a victorious smile, swaying.</p>
<p>Each family that bought long ingots immediately burned them outside the door. The paper ashes danced, fluttering like butterflies. Once the paper butterflies had flown away, the doors of each house slammed shut with a bang.</p>
<p>Everyone says that burning these twice a month, on the first and fifteenth days, can get the blessing of heaven, eliminate disasters and bring blessings, and the cost is only a few coppers, which is a great bargain. And those who sell long ingots live off this kind of psychology.</p>
<p>Hearing the sound of long ingots means knowing that it is already the first and fifteenth days. Knowing that it is already the first and fifteenth days of the long-forgotten lunar calendar. Therefore, the seller of long ingots is the reporter of the abandoned calendar, the supporter of the abandoned calendar, and the extent of superstition among Shanghai people is also evident.</p>

<p>The giant film "Charlie Chan's Chance," which combines mystery and love in a Chali Chan case, is bizarre, amazing. The film tells the story of a Scottish detective chief who was killed. The deceased had been investigating a murderer and was brutally killed as soon as he obtained a clue. Famous detectives from England and New York cooperated to investigate this double homicide, but not only could they not find any clues, but they also fell into a fog and were helpless. The great Chinese detective Charlie Chan happened to be in New York investigating the use of punishment in police courts. He was invited to investigate the case. Mr. Chen adopted a unique approach, using his calm and calm mind to capture the murderer, and also cleared a pair of young men and women and four others who were suspected by the police of being heavily suspected. The film is so mysterious and bizarre, and Charlie Chan's dissection skills are breathtaking. The film has recently been released at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Those who love to watch detective novels and films should watch it first.</p>

<p>Civil Rulings One Item: Luo Jingci: Your petition for enforcement is granted. After reviewing the petition, the case is under appeal, so the enforcement request should be delayed. This is the ruling. ▲ Chen Zelin and others' petition for issuing a certificate for managing the estate. After reviewing the petition, the court's previous ruling ordered the petitioners to publish the draft announcement in the newspaper for five consecutive days. After twenty days, they should submit the newspaper clippings for verification. Now, only the April 9th newspaper clippings have been submitted. It is impossible to determine whether the petitioners complied with the previous ruling to publish the announcement in the newspaper for five consecutive days. The request for issuing the certificate should be processed after the newspaper clippings have been submitted for review. This is the ruling. ▲ One Item: Shi Lei's petition for exemption from enforcement. After reviewing the petition, the debtor Gao Kezhi's car was previously seized. Now, it is stated that the debtor has obtained the petitioner's consent to repay in installments after his financial situation improves, and he requests exemption from enforcement. This should be approved. Order that officials be dispatched to unseal the car on a scheduled date. This is the ruling. ▲ One Item: Dahua Auction Company's request to remove the estimated value of light bulbs. After reviewing the submission, in the case of Zhi Da Printing Materials Bureau, etc., versus Zhang Jianqiu for debt enforcement, the company has legally conducted a fair appraisal. The appraised value listed should be the standard for the auction. The claim that a batch of unexamined light bulbs were appraised at a price of fifty-nine yuan is harmful to the interests of both parties. Furthermore, it is questionable why the prices were rashly assessed without inspection at the time of appraisal. Therefore, the request is difficult to approve. This is the ruling. ▲ One Item: Hu Shusheng's request for issuing a certificate for managing the estate. After reviewing the petition, the certificate for managing the estate is approved. Order that you come to the court at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month to collect the certificate and file the newspaper. This is the ruling. ▲ One Item: Zhu Guangfu versus Zhu Xiangsheng for rent arrears and provisional attachment. Request for refunding the guarantee deposit. After reviewing the petition, the request for refunding the guarantee deposit of one hundred yuan is approved. Order that the petitioner come to the court at 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month to collect the deposit. This is the ruling. ▲ One Item: Di Baike versus Fan Youcheng for rent arrears and provisional attachment. Agent Yu Dazhong's request for refunding the guarantee deposit. After reviewing the petition, the case has been withdrawn. The previous guarantee deposit of one hundred yuan is approved for refund. Order that you come to the court at 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month to collect the deposit. This is the ruling. (May 19th)</p>
