<p>微</p>
<p>東北淪陷。於今一年矣。憶事件發生時。國人請命於政府政府乞靈於國聯國聯求助於美國。美國就商於英法。而其結果。乃僅有國聯調查團之派遣國聯調查團。又費時半年餘。始見報告書之完成。而其内容如何吾人猶未能聆究竟。如此迂回曲折之外交途徑。即我國目前之所遵循者</p>
<p>反觀對方之日本又如何。一日之内陷瀋陽。十日之内佔長春。克吉林。取龍江。一月之内。巳盡捲我東省之土地物産以去。且也轟錦州。擾天津。更進而攻毁淞滬。其軍事行動之敏捷。固無待言。而扶植僞國。强奪我郵權。覇佔我海關。武裝移民之計畫。旣巳着着實現。文化侵略之設施。亦在漸次舉行。今復承認僞國與之訂立條約。世界之輿論不顧焉。列强之抗議不聞焉。此一味孤行不稍返顧之對華方針。即日本目前之所採取者。</p>
<p>以前例後。以彼較此。其手段孰爲有效。孰占便宜。固不待智者而後明。然而吾國上下似尙未澈底覺悟。猶欲求人而不求己。徒引列强以自衛。藉條約作保障。嗚呼。其亦不思之甚矣。</p>
<p>最近電訊。日本承認僞國事。我政府巳草擬通牒。除向日本提出嚴重抗議書外。復要求國聯。立即採取有效步驟。並請九國公約簽字國。對於日本行動。予以嚴重注意。以解决此嚴重局勢。此項辦法。原不能謂不善。且亦爲外交上應有之舉動。然而僅提一紙抗議。發一通照會。果遂能戢日人之野心乎。遂能邀各國之注意乎。其必不然。蓋任何人能知之矣。</p>

<h3 id="c10">故宮博物院 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>國家重寳、粹於故宮、千百年來繩繩世守、蓋我國五千年文化之跡象、歷史所淵源、幾盡於是、不僅方物珍異而已也、君主時代、舉全國以奉一人、凡此皆非國人所易窺見、學者所得研究、自民國十三年甲子移宮事定、乃有故宮博物院之設置、公開展覽、影印流通、固足以快好古者之朶頣、尤足以供學問家之探討、怱怱者瞬將十載、聲聞宇内、遠逮外洋、重譯來觀、幾無虚日、我向來以古國逢居以文化自矜、蓋至此而文化之歷史、乃一一披露於全球、蓋就中藏庋、無不與文物有關、即無不與歷史相啓發、我國人幸而獲覩、什襲珍藏、正宜如何愛惜、用爲國光、以昭來許、乃自博物院設立後、中更多故、至最近道路又時有遷移出賣之傳言、夫國家以文德武力爲立國之本、我未能尙武、無庸諱言、若併此文治之區區、而不能善守、使千百年來獨夫所不爲者而冒大不韙以爲之、則誠可愛痛哭而長太息者矣、爰略述博物院成立之經過、以見締造之艱難、俾國人共知注意焉、</p>
<p>博物院藏庋之豐、淵源所自、未易盡述、其點查報告巳數十册、猶未足以盡之也、至其成立之經過、撮要言之、約可分爲數時期、茲先述其第一時期、即溥儀之出宮、</p>
<p>溥儀出宮、根據於十三年十一月四日攝政會議所决定、其執行者爲鹿鍾麟時任警衛司令、張璧時任警察總監、李石曾爲國民代表、執行時先由國民軍總部繳去駐守淸宮景山之衛隊千二百人後、即由鹿等派員入見紹英朱益藩、請溥出宮、溥於一度會議之後、雖允出宮、但謂宮内私物應加檢點、非日夕所可了、於是議定溥先出宮、同時傳知各宮太監宮女、收拾細軟、於下午四時十分乘汽車至其父醇王府、同時淸室附屬各機關亦經自動解散、出宮前並將國璽及宮殿全部交還民國。而宮内老妃二人仍由宮監暫侍、至點查物品之事、即以淸室紹英等四人民國警廳及警衛部各二人爲委員充之·國務院並聘李石曾爲委員長、同時開始查封、閣議時亦已通過委員會之組織條例矣、下此爲委員會時期、</p>
<p>在移宮之際、北京政府本與溥儀修正優待條件、廢除尊號、移出宮禁、年給五十萬元、然此後淸室雖巳出宮、仍别謀反對、於是併此修正之條件、亦無形廢止、至委員會正式於十一月二十日成立、凡委員十五人、監察員三人、又另聘三人、此外各院部派二人助理、乃委員十五人中、淸室方面五人、始終無一到者焉、</p>
<p>攝閣未久改組、段祺瑞任執政、於此乃少生變化、遽令内部轉委員會、停止點查、委員會初不爲動、而内務部亦終於維持委員會之主張、時委員會初期成立、興高采烈、開始工作、對於段執政之異議、一不之恤、卒於國務會議修正辦法、於原有委員以外、添派各部長官及重要員司等、以爲之緩衝、至其時段之卒肯俯就者、一由於諸委員之努力、由於監察委員莊藴寬之調護、以莊氏素性淸直、夙爲段所敬視、得其一言、事遂以解、時内務部並仍堅邀淸室之五委員、卒不肯來、蓋彼等意圖恢復、别立塗徑、執意與民國不合作、爲無可奈何之事、其後溥儀又來索取私用物品、委員會亦經允許、但所取珍貴皮貨等、一出神武門、即爲滿員及宮監所朋分、溥儀所得、亦只　襲而已、旋以慶豐司地契事、淸室又訐委員會於段、而委員會則提出復辟證據、請檢察廳起訴、以相抵制、一時報章盛傳、卒也委員會之接收地契、未予置議、而復辟亦由檢廳查係一月一日大赦以前、予以不起訴之處分、所以兩全之者、殆亦無辦法之辦法也、</p>
<p>時委員十五人、爲汪兆銘（易培基代）蔡元培（蔣夢麐代）鹿鍾麟張璧范源濂兪同奎陳垣沈兼士葛文濬紹英載潤耆齡寳熙羅振玉紹英、以下五人爲淸室委員、監察則警廳檢察廳及敎育會外、添聘吳敬恒張繼莊藴寬三人、</p>
<p>委員會旣鑒於淸室之多事阻撓、非公開不足以謀制止、遂决定開放爲故宮博物院、於十四年雙十節正式成立、先即議决組織大綱、由點查委員會赴各宮提取陳列品、并由委員會推舉博物院理事多人、均一時知名之選、而雙十節竟以開放、參觀者萬人空巷、自後由點查而公開、人民遂得以暢游、而故宮博物院、亦益爲國人所注意矣、</p>
<p>然數閱月後、故宮又以政潮關係、由理事負責時期而入於維持會時期、蓋十五年三一八慘案之後、李石曾易培基先後離平、博物院由董理理事會聯席會議、推盧永祥莊藴寬爲維持員、盧不在北平、則一以屬之莊氏、維時軍隊更調、莊遂商之内部、借調警衛、時内部正圖揷足、遂欣然以其衛隊及内部所管之古物陳列所警衛合組之衛隊、應命調院、而院方則深反對内部之揷足、改其所派之各員爲顧問、内部怫然、亦無可無何也、維時經費不足、莊氏至舉私債三萬金以應之、乃四月二十三日、直魯聯軍忽派兵包圍故宮、迫令騰讓、事出意外、立由王士珍趙爾巽等訊之奉魯將領、咸謂不知、遂得派員與商、將圍宮之兵他調、幸告無事、然數月後内閣又更、杜錫珪受任、吳佩孚實主持之、淸室以吳爲易與、復函國務院及吳氏、謀恢復優待、一時反響雲集、吳亦郤之、然國務院卒正式通過改組博物院、由院聘委員二十一人、訂保管辦法六條、所聘委員、互選趙爾巽爲委員長、孫寳琦副之、而博物院同人遂堅持不還溥儀不變賣不毁滅三端、又新舊交替、則另組點交委員會焉、</p>
<p>政局更迭、故宮之事、輒爲衆目所集中、於是名流學者復有維持會之設、幾經集議、始推江瀚爲會長、莊及王寵惠副之、嚴定規章、函内部備案、内部亦准予成立、批暫時負責維持、一俟正式組織成立、此會即行解散、於是此臨時結合之團體、乃於烈風暴雨之中、負此莫大之責任矣、</p>
<p>維持會成立、苦於經費無着、遂議定處分銷耗品、所謂無關文化之金銀荼葉食品等類是也、曾訂有臨時招標規則及臨時監察會規則、似頗愼密、迨張作霖任大元帥、彼時國務會議、乃議决太廟堂子應歸内部、軍械檔案應歸國務院、同時又有主張查辦者、則其時載濤任帥府翊衛長、欲圖中傷博物院也、所幸後此當局翻然大悟、雖微加改組、而仍留委員會、且聘王士珍爲委員長、王式通袁金鎧副之、下此遂入於奉方管理之時期、由國務院所聘之委員至院接收、又派幹事二十四人、制度未加更改、於是者七月、革命軍至北平、國民政府遂令易培基接收、經費則進行中英庚欵、圖得補助、至一切接收、雖頣和園淸史館少有周折、然故宮則甚順利也、</p>
<p>時有經亨頣氏、動議將古物售賣消滅、故宮同人聞而大駭、所幸經案旋即打銷、國府又頒布故宮博物院組織法、并任命理事、組織理事會、又由理事會續推十人、並推李石曾任事事長、易培基爲院長、以至於今、未多更易、</p>
<p>至於最近、乃有處分金銀等事發生、實則處分已於去年由國府規定辦法、而一切均須照章由當地司法學術界之監視以爲之、但觀其手續是否完備、苟完備者、情弊固不易發生也、然懷寳者迷邦、於是紛然復有售寳之說、或謂舉全部以購軍械、或謂一部分巳微有接洽、或謂遷地實變賣之先聲、或謂主售者實憤而出此、實則此千百年來之寳藏、舍保存以外、不應有他議、而况數千年專制政體一旦芟夷、始得化故宮爲博物院、國粹即國魂之所寄、人民又豈能點爾以息、坐視文物之淪喪、前年國府於舊書出洋尙有禁令、以此視彼、又豈不更重且大、甚願所傳之不確也、</p>

<p>亟於承認原因</p>
<p>違背公約遵嚴</p>
<p>電請撤回駐使</p>
<p>呈請明令討伐</p>
<p>宋子文談路透社十五日上海消息、中國財政部長宋子文、今日語路透記者、謂李頓報告書、業巳擬成、將於數星期内發表、此日政府所以亟亟於承認「滿洲」國也、此舉豈非謂日本深恐李頓報告書、將斷定所謂滿洲國政府者、純爲日本所造之傀儡、而所謂代表東三省民意者、純爲空中樓閣乎、試觀東三省義勇軍接踵而起、聲勢日盛、全境交通爲之停頓、而瀋陽長春哈爾濱且被攻擊、形勢如此、而謂東三省人民、亟願造成新邦、寗非囈語、如日本聽人秉公調查、無所惶慮、則何爲不待諸調查結果公佈之後乎、日本軍人、當然持一種怪異理論、以爲日本如不在國聯集會考慮李頓報告書之前、承認其所手造之僞機關、則未免示弱而無决心、惟此種理論、僅值得幼童在黑暗中呼嘯耳云、</p>
<p>學者意見大陸報云、記者昨以日本决定承認僞國事、徵詢本埠兩國際公法學者意見、俱稱、日人此舉、確係違背九國公約、因該約簽字國、必須尊重中國領土與行政之完整也、邇來有關係方面、曾提出一種新辯論、以爲按照約文、簽字國乃係尊重中國領土與行政之完整、而非擔保其完整、據第一專家意見、尊重與擔保、固似有别、但試問一國將如何表示其尊重他國領土與行政之完整自必以不加侵犯使其受有損害爲斷、日人諉稱僞國爲民族自决結果、恐祇有昧於僞國在日軍佔領滿洲以後所産生之事實者、始能信此說也、總之不論尊重與擔保之意義有無分别、在日本無關重要、因無論如何、日本巳犯違約之罪、但在他國、則此二語、頗有軒輊、因苟負有保證之義務、則有積極行動、使中國領土與行政之完整不受侵犯之責也、惟日本此次在國聯開會以前、公然承認僞國、則乃逼國聯不得不有所切實主張矣、又據第二專家意見、則稱九國公約各國、旣以信義簽訂、自當以信義遵守、該約並非法律條文、自多疏漏處、日本苟欲曲解文過、自屬易易、因該約乃係一種同意協定、當簽訂時、即深信各國當能忠實遵行、受其拘束故也、今日人所持該約係遵重而非擔保之辯、不能稱爲一種辯論、僅可視爲文過之語而巳、</p>

<p>滿場劈拍聲此組之情形、變方皆以壓殺制勝、倍倫斯與梅咸斯竭全力撲殺、其所以獲勝二盤、悉皆由此、加以德孚亦以此見長、於是滿場劈拍之聲、</p>
<p>戰略之錯誤上場第一盤、以德惠兩人之尙未能管束出球、時飛野外、而加以倍梅樸殺之猛烈、二比二後、德惠連失三局、以二比五落後、至此方知對殺之錯誤、乃施以凖確之高球、而奪回三局成五五平手、然七比六、突然又失二局、卒經過不少之「相等」之局、而以十比八勝第一盤、</p>
<p>德孚顯顔色德惠苦戰先勝、然第二盤於强敵重壓之又以四比六失敗、四比四平局、連失二局、各獲一盤德孚乃於第三盤大顯顔色、回復其猛烈凖確之上網攔殺、淸脆爽快、大有可觀、三比一之後、無情網拍下、又連斬三關、六比一大勝第三盤而以二比一居先、</p>
<p>不耐煩失敗然而事有出人意料、第四盤倍梅再以六比二打二比二盤之平局、最後决勝之一盤、倍梅竟以不耐煩而失敗、德惠以三比二居先、梅咸斯再失去發球之一局、形勢遂劣、繼而德惠又自一比三計挽回勝成局成五比二、最後一局、倍倫斯以二次發球重錯、竟奉送之而終</p>
<p>老蔣雖勝少年顯威風</p>
<p>林寳華邱飛海六比三六比一六比四鄭兆佳余田光</p>
<p>林邱經劇戰而勝局數雖爲直落三、而其中却曾經一番劇戰、第三盤鄭余以四比三局佔先、大有奪得一盤之勢、而其中數局鄭余悉以三比一計居先而爲林邱挽回、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳大受讚賞鄭兆佳之表演、已小顯其最近球藝之一斑、發球重而有力、其擊出之球、知其已能集中其力量、其向兩邊抽出之球、疾飛如矢林邱回者甚鮮、戰略亦不錯、利用高球使林邱後退、皆甚凖確、尤以第三盤甚爲、</p>
<p>余田光弱點所在余田光昨日之戰、亦可謂其精彩之作、大敵當前、當以另論、出球亦有力、網上工夫甚佳、惟其弱點則爲膽量小、故一二兩盤中、高球太近、皆落林邱手、第三盤則大佳、底線正手之重抽、時時觸網内、尤宜加以訓練也、</p>
<p>復複賽權之比數鄭余勝推納、克利諾夫得複賽權、其比數爲十四比十二·六比二·六比二·</p>

<p>東華大敗林肯</p>
<p>七千球迷喜極欲狂</p>
<p>五比二林肯遭慘敗</p>
<p>丨球塲慘劇林肯球員腿骨折斷丨</p>
<p>昨日東華足球隊以全副精神、對付林肯、結果東華以五比二大勝、開林肯來滬後從來未有之失敗紀錄、昨並值中秋佳節、各界休假、故蒞場參觀者、殊爲踴躍、約計七千餘人、棒球場四週、座爲之滿、誠罕有之盛况、且表演精烈、與觀至此、無不喜極欲狂、良辰佳節、生色不少、惟林肯左内鋒利克斯、竟遭腿骨踢斷之慘局、殊覺美中不足、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>東華攻守均出色東華後衛分工合作馮運佑監視林肯中鋒、屠開元頂牢虎將寇克罕姆、吳幼良頂牢左翼、李寗與關洵安監視兩内鋒、陸鍾恩坐鎭龍門、各盡所長、戒備嚴密、無懈可擊、而前鋒陳家球陳虞添之短傳遞、極盡能事、每使對方無從捉摸、錢敬鏞驍勇如故屢有妙傳、厥功不少、曹秋林脚頭雖硬、惜有胆怯之弊、總之、全隊精神振作、氣熖甚熾、惜表演稍覺遲慢耳、陣容如下、</p>
<p>陸鍾恩李寗關洵安上王長頴下屠開元馮運佑吳幼良錢敬鏞萬象華下陳洪光上陳家球陳虞添曹秋亭</p>
<p>林具陣綫有調動林肯隊之陣綫、較第一戰稍有出入、名將巴恩斯培未出場、利克斯亦僅於下半時出場任左内鋒、内幸卽遭腿骨折斷之慘事、昨由列萊及台萊特兩新將上場、蓋以資訓練耳、故實力大遜、前鋒綫極形散漫、至緊要關頭、呼應乏人徒呼負負、佈陣如下、</p>
<p>海斯阿許透納柯克巴勃台特萊白爾特萊利克斯上列萊上希琴斯列特萊寇克罕姆</p>
<p>總結賬五與二比上半時中、東華盛極一時、凈勝三球、陳洪光踼至二十五分鐘時、因腹痛退場由十人作戰、未幾、林肯左内鋒列萊、亦因脚痛離場、雙打各以十人作戰、東華後方嚴守、平安無事、前鋒奮勇壓迫、先由陳家球罰十二碼球、次由曹秋亭遠中一球、後由陳家球在門前射中、連中三元、下半時形勢稍遜、東華内衛、似有疏忽之象、致在平穩之局勢中、連失兩局、惟第二球之失、實因林肯左翼白爾特萊趨於極顯明之越位地位、竟被其得球直搗巢穴、裁判員及巡邊員均未察覺、故東華之負此球、實不幸之極、林肯兩球旣得、形勢頓覺嚴重、東華乃再接再厲、憑前鋒合作之得法、由家球虞添各中一球、乃以五比二終局、</p>
<p>東華聲勢勝林肯下午三時、裁判克列萊下令動員林肯先攻開始、步步逼進、得自由球陸鍾恩躍起接住送前方陳家球攻門無效、吳幼良曹秋亭迫得角球林肯頭頂解危、球復轉向東華、角球救出、陳洪光單槍匹馬、深入敵區、林肯守門衝出十五碼外、先一步將球踢出、化危爲安、惟東華攻勢極盛、顯在林肯之上、錢敬鏞屢得角球、圍而攻門、均未中的</p>
<p>十二碼球開紀錄十五分鐘時、陳虞添送球至右方、曹秋亭撥前帶進、球觸林肯左内衛手、罰十二碼球觀衆立時喜色洋洋、自鳴得意、陳家球主踼、飛入門之右角、極爲淸晰、紀錄遂開、中央開球又越五分鐘時、東華關洵安踼出越位球、陳家球接得帶前、林肯守門又跑出踼之、球爲曹秋亭得、曹卽向門送去、時守門跑出奔回、尙未立定脚步、不及轉身救球、是球遂被曹送入門之左角、東華遂得兩球、</p>
<p>陳家球再記一功從此東華聲勢愈大、林肯後方防不勝防、陳洪光在敵區得自由球、錢敬鏞送出太開無效、旣而陳家球迫得角球、錢敬鏞挑送雖佳、奈被守門救出、一波方平、一波又起、小錢在林肯右内衛脚上得球、傳送門前、陳虞添停得撥與家球、舉脚射門、應聲又中、球低向門角而進、極有功夫、俄而、上半時終了東華凈勝三球、</p>
<p>再戰聲起演慘劇檸檬過後易門再戰、曹秋亭一次奔前搶球、猛力攻門、球掠門出界、林肯乃引師侵進、幾度來往後、林肯左内鋒利克斯帶球盤進李寗向上搶奪、力道甚猛、利克斯旋卽臥地不起、阿許向前扶之、利氏之脚、巳皮連而骨斷矣、急抬至塲外、由在場之林肯兵士及軍官等施以急救後、遵歸醫治、恐成殘疾、</p>
<p>兩球連中驚四座東華繼續猛攻、林肯球門、四面受敵、左右射擊、勢如雨點、然每多不中、萬象華見高球頭迎、又出門外、林肯驟然反攻、東華後方、平安無事者已久、因之忽有疏忽現象、寇克罕姆打通防線後、傳球門前、右内鋒見球卽射、球勢低急、穿入網　、不三分鐘、林肯左翼接得後方之傳球、孤軍深入、直搗後方、王長頴未能阻擋、李寗上前亦無效、竟被盤至門前攻入、但此人早經越位、未經處罰、東華兩球連失、四座頓現恐怖、</p>
<p>陳家將盡忠報國東華見形勢不佳、乃復力事振作、聲勢又盛、林肯兩球得後、不多時間、陳家球卽還以顔色、攻入一球、是球先由陳射、守門仆地將球拍落地上、雙方力爭、肉搏多時、仍爲陳家球踼進、旋陳因腹痛退場稍休、五分鐘後再入戰陣、四周鼓掌迎之、陳虞添萬象華亦不示弱、聯絡並進、至門前不多距離、虞添亦建一功、斯時觀衆呐喊𦔳陣、聲震雲霄、此後互相角逐、形勢依然緊張、鳴金收軍、東華以五比二大勝、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3 id="c101">從前竟迷信和殘忍到這般田地 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>一次、相老人在樂善堂凉臺上，靜觀大自然界的形形色色，自適自賞，忽有所觸，喚我到面前，說了這些話。</p>
<p>「我想無正信仰，眞不知迷信和殘忍到何種田地，拿從前的事，來說一說。古人祇知天圓地方，帝王造車，頂要圓的，底要方的：這樣法天，眞是迷信。須知當敬「天生蒸民」天降下民」之天，即造物主；並非那有形有像的物體，蒼蒼者天！</p>
<p>有什麽天陽地陰，五行相尅。後漢時，人造屋，捉個過路的人殺了他，將屍埋在新屋基地下！說是壓鬼物；你說寃不寃？有什麽陽尊陰卑，戕賊女性。種種不人道的舉動，如唐人說部中曾稱道的，客人說了一聲主人的侍婢好，主人便吩咐把這婢女活活的蒸熟了，整個的屍體拿來饗客：這舉動，慘不慘？</p>
<p>韓昌黎算是個文豪，可是談到信仰就落伍；始闢佛，終佞佛；因爲他根本不了解人生，生前如何，身後如何：因此脫不了那虚搆的輪迥圈套了！國人學佛，大都這樣中心無主所造成的。</p>
<p>宋明理學，天即理，性即理，談來談去，連一個名詞都糾纏不淸楚！如言：「君心正則國治」。不知君心正以至於國治，中間要有多少治國階段；一個「則」字，談何容易？尙淸談，少實質。講理學的尙且如此糊塗；其他更不問可知了！</p>
<p>什麽時候，有正信仰，才破除種種迷信和殘忍啊（）」</p>
<h3 id="c102">月餅上印標語 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 徐浣花</p>
<p>丨請茶食店老閭注意丨</p>
<p>節屆中秋，人們吃月餅的狂熱，又在這東北不能恢復的時候，恢復了他的原狀丨當你經過那月餅化的街市：那飄舞飛動的月餅市招，和五光十色的月餅裝璜，一定會能引起你舌底甜津津的潤潮。不過月餅原名團圝餅，是寓有慶祝團圝的意義：現在國破家危，不知人們吃月餅的時候，發生什麽感想？余意月餅上最好印入警策標語，用以警醒一般人沈沈的迷夢，謹擬標準如下：　　「紀念國難和慶祝中秋，兩件事誰輕誰重？」</p>
<p>「日本人正在吮吸東北的血，你郤儘吃月餅丨」</p>
<p>「國土喪失，譬猶月餅巳殘缺一角。」</p>
<p>「這時節是你應吃月餅的時節嗎？」</p>
<p>「願你多節省幾個月餅錢，去捐助東北義勇軍。」</p>
<p>「你吃月餅時，切莫忘記東北人在喝西北風丨」</p>

<p>丨「月亮圓圓照九州，幾家歡樂幾家愁：幾家夫婦同羅帳，幾家飄零在外頭」！丨童謠丨</p>
<p>東三省的義軍、一年來與敵人血戰，前仆後繼，巳屢次攻入瀋陽，然終因子彈的不繼而退出。現在義軍又宣言於中秋節，要攻入瀋陽吃月餅。他們一心想以黑鐡救起我中華埀死的民族，更想以赤血洗刷我以往的恥辱，想東三省義軍的中秋，定在砲火連天殺聲震野中過去。</p>
<p>關内尙能偏安的靑年，鑒於中秋的皓月當空，大地如銀，眞是及時行樂的時候。有的密約情人出外踏月，以尋幽趣，喜孜孜的候中秋日的到來，以亨人生的樂趣，只重情人的啼笑，不管國家的安危。情侶們的中秋，在這樣旖旎風光中過去。</p>
<p>富人們遇到中秋節，以爲「人生幾見月當頭」，豈能錯過？正在遍邀親朋，到中秋節那夜，月下開筵，實行賞月，在富人眼光中，自然以中秋爲賞心樂事。</p>
<p>窮人們因中秋的到來，各處債戶紛集，兇狠坐索，應付無方，非但嘗不着一些月餅與白果的味兒，只多見識些人世的炎凉與冷酷！在窮人的眼光中，自然以中秋節爲窮途末路。</p>
<p>每過中秋，農人們個個喜形於色，因爲田裏總有相當的收成了，農人們以一分勞力，得一分收穫，一杯麥酒，快樂地在田岸上過農人們的中秋</p>
<p>年來以市塲的蕭條，工商業一蹶不振，工廠相繼倒閉，工人大半失業。現中秋節又到了，不知又要多少的商店和工廠將要倒閉？社會上又將多一批哀苦無告的失業人民，中秋節於這輩職業在飄搖中的人，是怎樣一個可怕的印象啊？</p>
<p>熱河告急有懷蔣蔡兩將軍柱尊</p>
<p>又報熱河急。吾眞不忍言。長期誰抵抗。連歲失屏藩。萁豆皆兄弟。臣奴到子孫。何當呼蔣蔡。重爲國招魂。</p>
<p>喜聞東三省義軍有進展</p>
<p>寇來又巳一年經。滿目瘡痍只涕零。鶉首賜秦天竟醉。酒邊哀郢我猶醒從今豈有靑天隱。舉義誰將白馬刑差喜關東諸志士。奮身殺敵報時聆。</p>

<p>丨耶穌征服魔鬼？丨</p>
<p>我是一位無宗敎者，在這個星期日，應了校中同事的邀約，到隔壁的耶穌堂去做禮拜。牧師站着講聖經，講好了聖經唱讚美詩，這樣虔誠的做過之後，再繼之以靜默的禱告：照樣的幾次，一聲亞們，算是禮畢。正在這個時候，門外驚天動地的喧擾着。</p>
<p>「我不肯進去，我進去了將無安身之處，我無論如何也不能進到這扇門裏……」</p>
<p>做禮拜的人，有幾位年靑些的，爭先走到外面來看，纔知喊看的是一位少婦，不過態度是瘋狂極了。在伊的旁邊，還有幾位女敎友，挽住伊。伊總是不肯走進，虧得趙牧師想出了一個妙法，他拿了一本聖經出來，呌伊看着，伊嘴裏說：</p>
<p>「兩條道路的……要難煞我呢！……要難煞我呢！」伊終於這樣說着給聖經引導了走進耶穌堂。</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人和敎友們，都擁擠在伊的身旁；伊呢丨正在張牙舞爪地好似忿恨不該走進一般，雙目睜得好似一對銅鈴，形狀是怕極了！</p>
<p>陪伊來的兩位女敎友，這樣的爲觀衆略述伊的狀况：</p>
<p>「伊是紹興人，因爲受不住阿婆的虐待，到了眞的熬不下去的時候，去懸樑自盡，伊的阿婆看見伊辦眞公事，也去仿效了。可是給同居的人爲伊們解救。伊的男人，因爲失業在家，看了不安的情形，倒實在的去自縊丨後來，伊的阿婆給伊轉嫁：現在伊的前夫尋着伊，巳有幾個月了。我們想，還是耶穌能征服，所以呌伊來做禮拜，信了敎，伊的前夫，總不至於再來尋着伊了！」</p>
<p>伊跟着做了一次禮拜，就恢復了伊原有和善的狀態丨耶穌堂的所在，浙江烏鎭。</p>

<p>（八）</p>
<p>芬若爲了感受到大的快樂與感激，心中開了一朶極大的笑之花，但是伊不能制止眼淚像礦泉一般地橫流。伊十幾年的古井，是枯涸，死寂，一些没有生意，無論如何意想不到這靑氈坐守的小學敎員，會一變而爲糾糾的武夫，而且是一個爲國抗仇的英雄；伊更想不到他再會找到伊，向伊求情；伊更疑慮他是不是眞的丢棄了自己的夫人，是不是眞的還没有娶新的雍容華貴的新夫人，是不是眞的願意要一個老寡婦回去？伊不知自己應該如何允許他或拒絶他。伊又再三地熟慮，爲他前途的幸福，名譽，事業着想，確是不應該允許他跟他去，無論如何應該把伊自己犧牲，伊伏在桌子上嗚咽地，恣情地痛哭。</p>
<p>「芬，你不要哭！我可以告訴你一些眞誠的話。盛大的歡迎會，不能打動我的歡心，我只哀哀地求你給與我一些快樂，讓我把十幾年渴想而徬徨無歸束的心，得到一個安頓，讓我把萬分熱戀的情緖，而虚掩着的心翼，有一個機會依舊蓋住了心房！啊！我的好芬若！我知道你以前的主張，和崇拜，所以逃身去投了軍，現在己達了目的；何况你的丈夫已死了十幾年，你的家族也没有了，你美麗的情緖還是和以前一樣，請你可憐我，安慰我，使我把未完成的事業完成它，未有歸束的心歸束它，你憐憫些我吧。」袁團長說的時候，毫没有武人腔調，而柔順地像一隻羔羊，他的確是掬心一般地拿眞誠來感化芬若。</p>
<p>「眞的？眞的？」芬若聽得像受了催眠術一般，眞的止了哭，仰起了𩓐子，望着袁團長，狠興奮而又感到愉快，「但是，我將用什麽方法來證明你的話完全是合理呢？我又將用什麽方法來測騐社會上不反對你的行爲是不錯的呢？假使是照你的話做，我又自己如何剖别我的舉動，是不謬誤？」</p>
<p>「芬若，我的好姑娘！」袁團長格外激昻而興奮了。</p>
<p>「咦！我那裏還是個好姑娘？」芬若有些驚奇，疑慮他敢許出於故意椰揄。</p>
<p>「這是我的主觀，我的直覺，我的確還當你是一個好姑娘兒，而且是一個至高無上的天人，」</p>
<p>我祈求你，請你信任我的說話是完全合理，而且完全不錯誤；假使你允許了，那是你的舉動，才一些也不差，你的思想，才完全準確。」</p>
<p>「但是你太對不起你以前的夫人了。」</p>
<p>「那没有法子；何况現在巳不知下落。」</p>
<p>「萬一將來又遇見了，你將如何處置，這是與你的名譽事業，都有十二分關係，你應該仔細考慮。」</p>

<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>現在科學昌明的時代，没有實在的學問，是不能創造什麽偉大的事業的，換句話說，就是偉大的事業，不是没有學問的人所能創造的，</p>
<p>試觀古今以來的大發明家，那一個不是没有眞實的學問，那一個不是没有數十年實在的研究，他們可說是没有一個僥倖成功的呀，</p>
<p>古時，兩個大將對陣交鋒，假使其中有一個敗了，那麽，他就要拿出最後的看家本領，口中念念有詞，想借祖師或師父的法寳，但是結果，他决不能取勝敵人，又如現在的賽球，事前不肯實地練習，待至比賽時，却希望敵人中的健將忽地受了傷，抬到醫院裏去，這種念頭，我認爲是人格的墮落，思想的衰敗，</p>
<p>又有幾個人愁没有錢，不能得到高深的學問，我說，這不要緊，即如我國的孟子，西方的愛狄生，地們幼時那一個有錢，我還可說一句，大發明家多半是没有錢的，我們只要刻苦用功，實地練習，没有錢的問題，簡直不能成立，　　没有，我要說，「國家的强盛，必須有實在的學問，僥倖是不能成功的，」</p>

<p>— 紹良</p>
<p>石油西名ＰＥＴＲＡＬＥＵＭ，是液體燃料，比煤炭等固體燃料都要好得多，因爲牠不但是容易發火，而又無渣滓，燃燒時，只要將牠注入於貯油的地方，用管引至火口，便能繼續點火，毫不費事，由此看來，石油確是一種最好的燃料喲！　　世界各國，雖都産油，而以美俄兩國爲最多。我國陜西，甘肅，新疆，四川，雖産石油，但没有大規模的開採，不敷本國應用，以致外油行銷於我國，據最近調查，每年約一○一、五二二、八四二石，像這種鉅大的漏巵，若不設法挽回，眞是可惜！</p>
<p>牠的採取法，有手工和機器兩種：用手工來採取時，是用人力在煤田各處，掘成深井，達到了石油的所在，用喞筒吸出，貯於大槽内，送往精製所。用機器採取時，先在油田上，搭個高架的台，裝個鐡滑車，連着槓桿和鐡錐鐡棒，再用機器的力，牽動槓桿，使鐡錐提起落下，把油田鑽成深井，然後便可以汲出油來了。</p>
<p>石油是褐色的液體，是由古代的動植物，經地殻的變動，埋在地下的泥土中，受上面很大的壓力，又不流通空氣，至很久的年代受細菌的作用分解而成的。若把牠放在鐡甑内用火加熱，熱至攝氏一百五十度時，所蒸出的氣體遇了冷，便變成揮發油。再熱至三百度時，所蒸出的氣體遇了冷，便變成煤油。再熱至三百六十度時，所蒸出的氣體遇了冷，便變成重油。</p>
<p>揮發油（ＶＯＬＡＴＩＬＥＯＩＬ）是無色透明的液體，性質甚輭，着火的温度甚低，不能供點燈之用。但可以除去衣服器具上的油垢和做機械中的燃料。</p>
<p>煤油（ＫＥＲＡＳＥＮＥ）是黃色的液體，牠的熱量很高，很容易燃燒。若將牠封在筒内，不致發生變化或腐敗，更無自起燃燒之虞，因爲有這些優點，所以用來點燈和做驅害蟲之用。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>重油（ＨＥＡＶＹＯＩＬ）是淡黃色糊狀的液體，發火很難。這種油中可以提出機器油（ＭＥＣＨＡＮＩＣＯＩＬ）和石蠟（ＰＡＲＡＦＦＩＮ）等。機器油是粘稠的液體，若塗在機械輪軸上，可以减少摩擦力，又可以做汽輛和軍艦上的燃料。石蠟是白色結晶的固體，加熱便融化，又很容易燃燒，可以用來製造洋燭和蠟紙等。</p>
<p>揮發油和重油，不能用來點燈，爲什麽火油可以點燈呢？這是因爲揮發油發火太快，危險甚多。重油發火太慢，危險少而點火難，所以揮發油和重油不能用來點燈。至於火油發火，快慢適宜，點火旣易，危險又少又可以完全燃燒，所以火油是可以點燈的</p>
<p>揮發油何以能除去汚垢呢？這是因爲牠能溶解油脂的物質，使牠漸漸揮發，所以衣服和器具上的油垢，是可以用揮發油除去的。</p>

<p>在我們這生物落後敎育破産事事皆膛乎人後的國家，自然有效法其他先進國家事物之必要，但是效法儘管效法，不應一味盲從，似乎亦應該擇其善者而從之，其不善者而改之吧，</p>
<p>我草此文之動機，就是看見昨天本刋談言欄佛君的一篇「兒女讀書的一篇賬，」有感而作，不過我單單的拿星期休假的問題出來，請大家加以討論，故謂我這篇建議案，謂之爲建議案可，謂之爲補充佛君的意見也無不可，但是佛君的文章，没有在本會發表罷了，</p>
<p>學校星期休假，考其究竟，多少帶些某某宗敎的色彩，歐風挾以俱來，我當局亦即不加考察牠的利害，而貿然效法至今，我究竟不知道在明瞭某某宗敎是一種帝國主義文化侵略麻醉思想的工具，而高唱打倒的現在，尙留這種劣跡存在是什麽意思，至於說牠是因爲六日勤苦攻讀，來用一日的休假，償失腦力吧，却近於一曝十寒，有同等矛盾，（人之腦力貴乎逐日運動逐日休養）因爲人每日用腦力的時間七八小時，那麽有一二小時的運動，或一二小時的閑眺散步，也很夠規復所耗腦力，而綽有餘裕，又何必將此一日之光陰來造成影戲院跳舞塲的罪惡，而荒廢有用的學業呢，我們的國家巳到了非讀書不足以救亡，非科學不足以救亡的時候，想太衆亦以我的話爲然吧，所以特地將此案鄭重提出，還請加以詳細的討論，尙有與佛君有同樣意思的地方不再贅述，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Can the Nine-Power Treaty Guarantee Our Territory? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>A Humble Opinion</p>
<p>The Northeast has fallen for a year now. Remembering when the incident occurred, the people pleaded with the government, and the government sought help from the League of Nations, which in turn sought assistance from the United States. The result was merely the dispatch of a League of Nations investigation team. The League of Nations investigation team then spent more than half a year before completing its report. However, we have yet to fully hear what its contents are. Such a roundabout and circuitous diplomatic path is what our country is currently following.</p>
<p>Looking back at Japan, the other party, how did they act? Within one day, they captured Shenyang. Within ten days, they occupied Changchun, captured Jilin, and took Longjiang. Within a month, they had swept away the land and resources of our Eastern Provinces. Moreover, they bombed Jinzhou, disturbed Tianjin, and further attacked and destroyed Shanghai. The swiftness of their military actions is self-evident. Furthermore, the plan to support a puppet state, forcibly seize our postal rights, occupy our customs, and arm immigrants has already been steadily implemented. The facilities for cultural aggression are also gradually being carried out. Now, they have recognized the puppet state and entered into treaties with it, disregarding world opinion and ignoring the protests of the great powers. This single-minded policy of acting alone and not looking back is what Japan is currently adopting.</p>
<p>Comparing the past with the present, and comparing them with us, which method is more effective and which gains more advantage is obvious even without the need for wise men to point it out. However, it seems that our country, from top to bottom, has not thoroughly awakened and still seeks help from others rather than from ourselves, relying on the great powers for self-defense and using treaties as guarantees. Alas, they are not thinking deeply enough about this.</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams, regarding Japan's recognition of the puppet state, our government has drafted a note. In addition to lodging a serious protest with Japan, it has also requested the League of Nations to take effective steps immediately and requested the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to pay serious attention to Japan's actions to resolve this serious situation. This approach cannot be said to be bad, and it is also a diplomatic move that should be taken. However, can simply issuing a protest and sending a note really curb the ambition of the Japanese? Can it really attract the attention of other countries? It certainly cannot. Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<p>The Bizarre Farce of Japan Recognizing the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>So-Called Signing of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol</p>
<p>Muto and Zheng Xiaoxu Acted as Performers</p>
<p>Our Country Prepared a Serious Protest to be Sent Out Today</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry Telegraphed the League of Nations to Take Effective Measures</p>
<p>(Changchun) The protocol for Japan's formal recognition of "Manchukuo" was signed at 9:10 this morning by Muto representing Japan and Zheng Xiaoxu representing "Manchukuo." The signing took place on a small table in the reception room on the upper floor of Pu Yi's residence. Pu Yi was also present at the time. The writing brush used for the signing was handed over to Pu Yi for preservation as a souvenir. Muto wore his general's uniform, while Zheng Xiaoxu and Pu Yi both wore full dress. Observers included "Manchukuo" cabinet members, Japanese advisors, Japanese civil and military officials, and representatives of the South Manchuria Railway. Several people were also present to film the event. However, news reporters and photographers were all outside the room. After the signing, everyone retreated to the neighboring room to toast each other. Then, Pu Yi received the Japanese representatives and some "Manchukuo" government officials. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Muto bears the title of ambassador for signing the protocol for Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," according to Tokyo political circles, it has not yet been decided whether Japan and "Manchukuo" will exchange ambassadors and ministers. Bao Guancheng, the mayor of Harbin, will go to Japan on September 24 to serve as the first diplomatic representative of "Manchukuo" in Tokyo, but his status has not yet been determined. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Full Text of the Protocol <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Solidifying Good Neighborly Relations</p>
<p>Respecting Treaty Rights and Interests</p>
<p>(Changchun) At 9:10 this morning, Muto, with full powers, and the Prime Minister of the neighboring country officially signed the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol at the Manchukuo Executive Government in Changchun. The full text is as follows: Japan-Manchukuo Protocol</p>
<p>Because the Empire of Japan confirms the fact that Manchukuo was freely established as an independent state according to the will of its residents, and because Manchukuo declares that all international clauses of the Republic of China, to the extent that they are applicable to Manchukuo, should be respected,</p>
<p>The governments of Manchukuo and the Empire of Japan, in order to permanently consolidate the good neighborly relations between the two countries, mutually respect their territorial rights, and ensure the peace of the Orient, agree as follows: (1) Before Manchukuo and Japan conclude another treaty in the future, all rights and interests of the Empire of Japan or its subjects within the territory of Manchukuo, based on existing treaties, agreements, other agreements, and public and private contracts between Japan and China, shall be confirmed and respected.</p>
<p>(2) Manchukuo and Japan confirm that any threat to the territory and security of one contracting party is also a threat to the peace and existence of the other contracting party. The two countries agree to jointly defend the nation. For this purpose, the Japanese army required for this purpose shall be stationed in Manchukuo.</p>
<p>This protocol shall take effect from the date of signing.</p>
<p>This protocol is made in two copies each in Chinese and Japanese. In the event of any difference in interpretation between the Chinese and Japanese texts, the Japanese text shall prevail.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, the undersigned, being duly authorized by their respective governments, have signed and sealed this protocol as evidence of their good faith.</p>
<p>Done at Hsinking (Changchun) on the 15th day of September of the first year of Datong. (Dentsu, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japan's Declaration to the World <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government issued a declaration to both domestic and foreign audiences at 4:00 PM today. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Empire has gambled its national fortune to save Manchuria and Mongolia from their crisis for the past twenty-seven years. Our officials and people have worked together, participating in the development of that area, and the result of our painstaking efforts has led to the prosperity of today. Now, that area has an inseparable relationship with the Empire in terms of national defense and the survival of its people. However, in recent years, China has been plagued by radical ideologies and pursued an exclusionary revolutionary diplomacy, causing our significant interests in Manchuria and Mongolia to be gradually eroded. This led to the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, which triggered our right of self-defense. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, the old Northeast regime was subsequently destroyed. The rulers, officials, scholars, and people of the four provinces of Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, the Eastern Provinces Special District, and various Mongolian banners and leagues took the opportunity to gather and, after consultation, issued a declaration of the establishment of a new state on March 1 of this year. On the same day, they severed relations with the Republic of China and announced the founding of the new state of Manchukuo. At the same time, they announced the construction guidelines of the new state, eliminating the dark politics of the past and implementing the politics of the kingly way. They also externally emphasized trustworthiness and sought amity, respected existing obligations, and adhered to the principles of open door and equal opportunity, clearly demonstrating an extremely fair political program to foreign countries. The government of that country sent a note to the Empire and sixteen other countries on the tenth day of the same month, repeatedly stating the purpose of its construction guidelines and requesting the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with that country. Recently, the Imperial government has been concerned and closely monitoring the development of the situation in Manchukuo for more than half a year. That country's sincerity and eagerness to implement the above-mentioned domestic and foreign policies are truly credible. In particular, the abolition of extraterritoriality and the revision of treaties regarding the opening of the inland to foreigners in general, as well as other treaty issues, have been prepared by a special committee, and there has been no unilateral action or abandonment. It has always been based on consultation with the parties concerned to achieve the realization of the revision. These attitudes are remarkable. As for financial and other administrative measures, improvements have also been seen. Now that Manchukuo is steadily realizing its independence, there is great hope for its future. The Imperial government, considering the above-mentioned domestic and foreign attitude of Manchukuo, and in view of the fact that the land of Manchuria and Mongolia is related to the safety of our national defense and the survival of our people, has decided to recognize Manchukuo as soon as possible, promote the stability of the region, and secure a solid foundation for the Empire's eternal peace and the peace of the Orient. Therefore, on this 15th day, Muto, with full powers, concluded a protocol with the authorities of the Manchukuo government, formally recognizing that country. The implementation of this recognition does not conflict with any treaty to which the Empire is a party, as can be seen clearly from the speech of the Foreign Minister at the provisional parliament on August 25 of this year. The protocol confirms that Manchukuo is an independent state established based on the free will of its residents, and at the same time confirms and respects all rights and interests of the Empire and its subjects in that country according to existing treaties and other agreements, eliminating the previous disputes over various rights and interests of ours in Manchuria and Mongolia. In view of the fact that any threat to Manchuria and Mongolia is also a threat to the Empire, Japan and Manchukuo jointly assume the responsibility of defending the country, and therefore stipulate that the Imperial army required for this purpose will be stationed in Manchukuo. In this way, the good neighborly relations between the two countries will be permanently consolidated, so as to ensure the peace of the Orient. The Empire has no territorial intentions towards Manchuria and Mongolia. The Empire has repeatedly declared that the protocol explicitly states that Japan and Manchukuo mutually respect their territorial rights and interests, and that Manchukuo's March 10 note to foreign countries clearly stated that it respects the open door policy regarding foreign economic activities. The Empire's demands on Manchuria and Mongolia have always been to ensure our legitimate rights and interests in that region, while eliminating all exclusionary measures, so that both domestic and foreign people can live in peace. Therefore, the Imperial government hopes that foreigners in Manchuria will engage in economic activities with equal opportunities, so as to develop and prosper that region. It goes without saying. Only when Manchukuo implements its foreign policy from top to bottom, and its above-mentioned sincere attitude gradually increases the recognition of the world and gains trust, should the countries concerned establish diplomatic relations with that country as soon as possible. Here, the Imperial government recognizes Manchukuo, blesses its future, and the officials and people of the Empire will work together to promote the beauty of Japan and Manchukuo coexisting and prospering together, hoping that there will be no regrets." (Dentsu, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Saito and Army Minister Araki have both expressed strong attitudes on the situation after the recognition of Manchukuo, roughly saying that Japan's formal recognition of Manchukuo will cause many international disputes to arise, but Japan, in any case, will be prepared to uphold the spirit of the Yamato nation to the end. It does not matter if international opinion is unfavorable. Furthermore, Army Minister Araki declared even more strongly that they will prepare their forces to wait for the intervention of a third country. (Hualianshe, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Muto to Move to Changchun <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the move of the Plenipotentiary Office in Manchuria to Changchun, an understanding was reached today between the commissioners of the Plenipotentiary Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the puppet state, and it was decided to move to Changchun in mid-October. (Dentsu, 15th)</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Decides on Three Countermeasures</p>
<p>Protest and Note Sent Out Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan's recognition of the puppet organization was fully implemented on the 15th according to the planned schedule. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' countermeasures had been carefully considered several times beforehand, and finally, after consulting with Wang and Song, a second deliberation was made. After the government received a telegram from Tokyo on the afternoon of the 15th regarding the so-called Japan-Manchukuo Protocol and the Japanese government's declaration, it further deliberated and decided on our approach as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Instruct our country's representative to the League of Nations to notify the League of Nations of the fact and impact of Japan's recognition of the puppet organization and request that it take the most effective measures. (2) In accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding procedures, send a note to the parties to the treaty, declaring Japan's violation of the treaty. (3) Lodge a serious protest with Japan. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs worked hard overnight on these three documents on the night of the 15th, and they were not completed until dawn, with the aim of sending them out completely on the 16th. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic authorities indicated to the press on the 15th that the countermeasures to deal with the Japanese government's recognition of the puppet state had been largely drafted, but the exact method to be adopted and the wording of the various written documents still needed to be finalized. As for the Japanese method of recognizing the rebellious, it was initially called a treaty, then a draft treaty, and then a protocol, which was unpredictable. It is not known what is in the gourd. Therefore, it is necessary to wait until after reading the exchange of documents between Japan and the puppet state before a final decision can be made. The protest to Japan and the note to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty will be issued around the morning of the 16th, using the fastest method to deliver them to their respective destinations. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Telegraphed Geneva Last Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to our country's representative to the League of Nations, Yan Huiqing, requesting that he notify the League of Nations to take effective measures against Japan's recognition of the puppet organization, was sent out on the evening of the 15th. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters telegraphed the League of Nations on the 14th, refuting Uchida's fallacies and asking the chairman of the League of Nations to be fair and impose effective sanctions on Japan, which is destroying peace. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Great Anxiety in Britain</p>
<p>Japanese Militarists Make Progress in China</p>
<p>British Newspapers Blame the Government for its Laissez-faire Policy</p>
<p>(London) The news of Japan's announcement of the recognition of "Manchukuo" has caused great anxiety in diplomatic circles and well-informed circles here. The full text of the protocol recognizing "Manchukuo" has not yet been published, but the impact of the recognition was seriously debated last month, so the general public is not surprised by the Japanese government's decision. The severity of the situation in the Far East is now universally recognized. The "Huixun Bao" reported that the current situation, morally speaking, has reached its lowest point. It continued to say that Britain's laissez-faire policy has allowed the Japanese militarists to make progress, so that today Japan has brazenly announced that in the eyes of the Japanese, the League of Nations, the United States, and the Lytton Report are not worth considering. The "Huixun Bao" also predicts that if Japanese militarism continues to run rampant, the future of the world is extremely worrying, and that mediation and reconciliation alone cannot achieve a solution. The only way to address this is to assist Chinese nationalism to defeat Japanese imperialism. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>A Cold Attitude in the United States</p>
<p>Unwilling to Take Any Further Action Before the Lytton Report is Released</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, a spokesman for the US State Department said in response to inquiries that the US government does not see any reason to officially take note of the agreement between Japan and the puppet state. The United States will regard the agreement as part of the Manchurian problem. (Guomin News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Li Yaxin, the Chinese advisor of the puppet state of Manchuria, called on the US President and claimed that the puppet state would strive for the recognition of various countries in Geneva, but also admitted that the current political situation in Manchuria is very chaotic. He said that it is expected that peace will be restored soon. It is also heard that the United States still hopes to cooperate closely with the League of Nations on the Far East issue. Stimson does not intend to take any further action for the time being until the report of the investigation team is released. (Guomin News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A reporter from the New York Times inquired at the State Department today about the authorities' views on Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo." The authorities do not want to take any new action until the Lytton Report has been considered. The reporter also said that the request from the US Consul in Harbin for additional police protection for American expatriates to prevent bandit attacks cannot be regarded as recognition of "Manchukuo." If the Chinese government wants to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty, the US State Department does not want to take any action until the Lytton Report is released, or perhaps after the League of Nations has made a resolution on the report before determining its position. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Celebrates Frantically</p>
<p>What are the Thoughts of the Chinese People?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, representatives of various groups, numbering 30,000, gathered at the Yasukuni Shrine to celebrate the recognition of "Manchukuo." Then, a military band led the crowd to the Imperial Palace. When passing the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Prime Minister's official residence, they all shouted "Banzai!" They then lined up in front of the Imperial Palace and bowed in respect amid wild shouts of "Banzai!"

<p>Rome. Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" was long expected. Official Italy was not surprised upon hearing the news today. Many ordinary Italians have expressed sympathy for Japan. The political world, however, will refrain from any criticism until further details are received. A key official declared that Italy's greatest concern is maintaining peace, avoiding a new arms race, and preserving Italy's commercial interests in the Far East. Italy will remain neutral. The general public is now closely monitoring the situation, as the League of Nations will react to this, and the future of the League of Nations may depend on the success or failure of handling the Sino-Japanese dispute.

<p>Foreign Ministry Negotiations</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Demonstrations</p>
<p>Japan Claims No Increase in Japanese Warships at Shimonoseki</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government learned that Japanese warships were equipping machine guns at the Shimonoseki and Osaka wharves and sending sentries to patrol. The Foreign Ministry sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side, informing them that at a time when public sentiment is indignant, the Japanese Navy should not take actions that incite the emotions of the masses and should remove these facilities as soon as possible and order the ships to sail elsewhere. According to the Japanese response, there are currently five Japanese warships docked at Shimonoseki. Two of them will return to Wuhu and Hankou separately on the 16th. As a result, there are still only three Ning military ships, which is no different from normal. The patrolling of sailors is only taking place on the hulks and will definitely not step beyond the hulks. As for the presence of machine guns on the hulks, it is not known for certain and will be investigated and answered later. Subsequently, the Japanese side claimed that the Japanese Qing hulk was not carrying weapons and only served for liaison and communication, which was no different from normal. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 15th, another Japanese warship arrived, bringing the total to five, including the Tenryu, Atago, and Inaho, which were docked at Shimonoseki. There were three unarmed Japanese soldiers on the Osaka wharf hulk, and two of our policemen on the shore to protect them. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the demonstration of Japanese naval machine guns at Shimonoseki two days ago, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan said today that the Nanjing military and police authorities and the Ministry of Military Affairs are negotiating with the Japanese authorities. The situation in Shimonoseki remains tense. Since this morning, the number of naval personnel at the Shimonoseki Osaka wharf has increased compared to before. It is not widely believed here that the Chinese government will issue an order to suppress "Manchukuo," as this approach would only shift the responsibility that Japan should bear to "Manchukuo," and China still believes that the people of the Northeast do not want independence and will still obey the Chinese government in the future. The situation in Nanjing is superficially peaceful, and there are no demonstrations or other movements. As important figures such as Wang and Jiang are not in the capital, there may not be any major developments recently. The handling of Sino-Japanese diplomacy is now entirely under the control of Foreign Minister Luo. Luo may discuss these important issues with the important figures remaining in the capital, but their decisions will be extremely cautious and will not be of any importance. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Export Tariff Regulations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has formulated provisional regulations for export tariffs. For goods subject to ad valorem export and transit taxes, the average wholesale market price at the time of customs inspection when the goods leave the ground should be used as the tax-paying value. If there is no wholesale market price available, the wholesale market price of other major domestic markets can be used as the basis for calculation. If the exported goods have been sold under a contract, the genuine contract stating the selling price should be submitted together with the report form for verification and can be regarded as proof of the value of the goods. If the exporter is dissatisfied with the price set by the customs or the amount of taxes and fees levied, they may submit a written protest to the Customs Commissioner within 20 days. Before the matter is resolved, they may submit the protested amount and request that the goods be released first. Upon receiving the protest letter, the Customs Commissioner shall submit the case to the General Customs Commissioner for review and transfer it to the Tariff Classification and Valuation Review Board for adjudication within 15 days.

In addition to telegraphed reply to treat them with favor and reward Guo’s division with 10,000 ocean, after our economic blockade was implemented, the source of supplies were cut off and there was a lack of food, especially for wounded soldiers who lacked medical care and the treatment was miserable. In addition, they hoped to cunningly succeed and urgently sought to expand outward. Last time, they fled south to Nanxiong, and this time they invaded Yihuang in the north, but were both met head-on by our Guangdong and Jiangxi troops and retreated to their old nest. At this time, the officers and soldiers in the bandits all wanted to escape. Now, Red Bandit Division Commander Guo leads his troops to return, which is a sign of its internal collapse.

<p>Telegraph Urging Punishment of Rebels</p>
<p>Advocating Strict Economic Severance</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Southwestern Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee telegraphed, "To be noted by all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all levels of party headquarters, all provincial and municipal governments, all people's organizations, and all newspapers: On September 18th of last year, Japanese imperialists, under the pretext of the Nakamura Incident, invaded and occupied the Northeast, and coerced the people into abandoning the deposed Qing Emperor Puyi to establish a puppet government. Now they have decided to formally declare recognition of this puppet government on the 15th of this month, violating the Nine-Power Treaty and undermining the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Their disregard for international justice and humanity is now fully exposed. At this critical juncture, there is no other way but to resist to the death and strive for survival. This department has today telegraphed the central government urging a swift decision on a grand strategy for thorough resistance. We especially hope that all compatriots across the country will uphold the righteousness of being responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, unite as one, and urge the central government to quickly assemble a large army to punish the rebels and recover lost territory, and to strictly implement economic severance to curb Japan's economic aggression.

On September 18th of last year, they suddenly seized our three northeastern provinces under the pretext of the Nakamura Incident and further utilized the deposed Qing Emperor Puyi, abandoned by the people, to establish a puppet organization. Our country, in order to respect the League of Nations Covenant, is awaiting the League of Nations' handling of the matter. Japan, however, took advantage of the international investigation period to invade Shanghai and harass Jehol. Now they have decided to recognize the puppet organization on the 15th of this month. Not only is the territorial integrity of our country being undermined, but the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty are also being completely trampled upon. In addition to telegraphing the central government to immediately decide on a grand strategy to cope with the situation, this committee, for the sake of national survival, for the sake of international credibility, and for the sake of world justice, vows to deal with the situation to the death, and will not hesitate to make any sacrifice.

<p>Guomin News Agency, London, 15th – Today, the British Foreign Office issued a statement warning British citizens not to travel through the puppet state of Manchuria. Given the current situation in Manchuria, travelers are advised not to take the Harbin-Siberia route to and from the Far East.</p>
<p>Franco-German Armaments Negotiations</p>
<p>Britain Will Act as Mediator</p>
<p>Advocates That All Relevant Countries Discuss the Matter at Length</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 14th – British Foreign Secretary Simon is closely monitoring the situation arising from Germany's demands and France's refusal. Britain will not issue a statement on its position on this dispute until the end of this week. Sources say that Britain is not issuing an immediate opinion because it is drafting a proposal of a conciliatory nature.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – The Daily Express predicts today that Britain will take new action regarding Germany's demand for equality in armaments. This will take the form of a proposal advocating that the Disarmament Conference's committee meeting should resume discussions on September 21st and then be adjourned, so that the most relevant countries can engage in consultations. It is reported that this proposal was initiated by British Prime Minister MacDonald. It is also reported that the British government's current policy is to grant Germany equal armaments status in principle, while concluding an agreement with Germany stipulating that Germany shall not re-arm in practice, and to reduce existing armaments of all countries through a disarmament convention.</p>
<p>German Parliament Speaker</p>
<p>Accuses Papen of Slander</p>
<p>Political Battle of Words Comes to an End</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 15th – German Parliament Speaker Göring today filed a lawsuit in court accusing Prime Minister Papen of slander. The grounds for the lawsuit are Papen's accusation that Göring's obstruction of government leaders' speeches on Monday was a violation of the constitution.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 14th – As far as the government is concerned, the dispute over the order to dissolve Parliament has come to an end today after State Secretary Meissner replied to Parliament Speaker Göring's second letter in the name of the President. Göring's second letter reiterated his demand for the cabinet's resignation and the revocation of the emergency decree, as described in yesterday's telegram. Meissner's reply stated that the order to dissolve Parliament became effective when the Premier delivered it to the Speaker. At that time, the Communist Party's motion for a vote had not yet been completed, so that vote cannot be valid without a doubt. Moreover, the Speaker's refusal to allow the Premier to speak has already violated Article 33 of the Constitution. At present, the government is determined to exert all its efforts to implement this view. Therefore, today, the Berlin Democratic Party's newspaper, the Berliner Volks-Zeitung, published an article by constitutional law professor Schwiesski stating that a study of the events of the past few days shows that the government has acted unconstitutionally. The authorities immediately ordered the newspaper to cease publication for one week. However, since there is no disruption to national security and order at present, there are no particularly special measures being taken for the time being. As for the date of the parliamentary re-election, it seems that the government has not yet decided. According to government officials, there is a 60-day deadline according to the constitution, so there is no need to rush to announce it.</p>

<p>To Prevent Its Realization</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 14th – Gandhi does not approve of the British government's plan for separate elections for the lower classes. If the British government does not amend this plan, Gandhi will begin a hunger strike on September 20th. Efforts are now being made on all sides to prevent the implementation of his hunger strike.

These representatives yesterday asked all parties to preserve the life of India's great man of our time. Hindu leader Malaviya has convened a meeting in Delhi to work out a plan as soon as possible for the participation of the lower classes in the Legislative Council. It is expected that this move may prevent Gandhi from immediately implementing his hunger strike plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – The government has decided that as soon as Gandhi begins his hunger strike, he will be moved from prison to suitable accommodation, but confined to that place without being allowed to leave.</p>

<p>Recent Situation of Active Volunteer Armies</p>
<p>Jilin, Dunhua, and Changchun are All Shaken</p>
<p>Japanese Army is Gradually Finding it Difficult to Cope</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Recently, the floodwaters in Jilin and Heilongjiang have gradually receded, and transportation in various places has been restored somewhat. The volunteer armies, which have been dormant for many days, have resumed their activities in different directions. The most vigorous advances and the fiercest battles have been those of Li Haiqing's attack on Anda Station, Yang Yaojun's attack on Weishahe, Cai Hongyou's attack on Mulan, Xu Zihe's attack on Keshan, Tian Zhaoying's attack on Qingcheng, Li Tiande's attack on Bayan, Wang Delin's attack on Dunhua, Qiu Zhenhua's attack on Yushu, Wang Fuchen's attack on Dehui, Gong Changhai's attack on Jilin, and Ding Chao's attack on Fujin. The following is a summary of the key events:</p>
<p>Li Haiqing's Attack on Anda Two months ago, the Japanese side spread rumors, vaguely stating that Li Haiqing and Ma Zhanshan had died in battle in Angu Town, northwest of Hailun. At the time, all parties knew that this was false. It was not until August 27th, when news came that Anda Station was under pressure, that it was known that the person leading the troops to recapture it was Li Haiqing himself. Two days earlier, Li's advance team of about 2,000 had advanced to Anda County, surrounded the county seat, and launched a fierce attack. A regiment of puppet army cavalry was stationed in the city, defending it in cooperation with the puppet militia and police. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle. After attacking and defending for nearly four hours, the city was finally captured by Li's army. Most of the puppet army broke through and fled to Wangkui, while some were disarmed. On the 27th, Li Haiqing himself arrived with his troops and advanced towards Anda Station. First, he sent people with name cards of Ma Zhanshan and Li himself to the local military and police authorities and the leaders of the Chamber of Commerce, informing them that he would lead his troops into the city and that there should be no resistance. The puppet Heilongjiang army stationed at Anda Station consisted of about 400 cavalry and 800 infantry, with attached machine gun and mortar special companies. The station was garrisoned by a large squadron of the puppet special district guard, about 400 men. They planned to unite and resist. Before the plan could be finalized, Li's advance team had arrived, infiltrated the city streets, and surrounded and disarmed the puppet army before they could escape. The weapons of the puppet guard were also confiscated at the same time. By 2 p.m., Li's troops had entered the city in succession, numbering over 4,000. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce was summoned and told to operate peacefully without fear. At the same time, he was ordered to hang the blue and white flag and issue a public notice to reassure the people. As a result, the merchants continued to operate as usual. At 6 p.m., Li dispatched 700 cavalry to Song Station, cut the telegraph wires, and demolished the tracks between Sartu and Song Station. The workers of the East Railway between the two stations were protected by Li's army and boarded a train at Sartu, ordering them to return to Harbin and report that Li Haiqing's Heilongjiang volunteer army had recaptured Anda. That evening, traffic on the Harbin-Manchuria railway was cut off, and telephone and telegram communications were disrupted. On the 29th, the Tadayama branch of the Amano Brigade of the Japanese army stationed in Heilongjiang, in conjunction with Japanese cavalry from Angangxi, went to attack on a train. At noon, the two sides made contact north of the railway, with intense artillery fire. At 1 p.m., three Japanese aircraft flew from Harbin to drop bombs, with the most bombs falling on the third and fourth streets in the city, destroying many shops and causing a large fire. At that time, Li Haiqing personally led his troops at the front line to supervise the battle. Wang Futing, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, braved the rain of bullets to go to the front and plead with Li to temporarily withdraw his troops to avoid excessive losses to the merchants. Li, unable to refuse the earnest request, led his troops to retreat to the Da Jingzi area, 40 miles outside the city, at 3 p.m. The Japanese army, seeing their momentum, did not dare to pursue. At about 4 p.m., a trainload of Japanese soldiers with over a thousand soldiers arrived from Harbin. The two teams joined forces and attempted to disembark to pursue the fleeing troops. At this time, Li's cavalry divided into two branches and outflanked Anda on the left and right, demolishing all the tracks and taking a surrounding posture, controlling the area from a distance. The Japanese army did not dare to leave the armored train and took a defensive posture inside and outside the station. Since the 30th, Li's troops have launched night attacks with cavalry. The Japanese army relied on armored vehicles to resist. Because there were no reinforcements, they were trapped. On September 3rd, Li's army advanced towards Qiqihar in large numbers, intending to strike directly at the provincial capital. Therefore, the situation in that direction became tense. Traffic on the Harbin-Manchuria railway has been cut off since August 27th and has not yet been restored. There will be major changes in the Angangxi and Boketu areas recently.</p>
<p>Yang Yaojun's Attack on Weishahe Yang Yaojun is the right-wing special operations unit of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, and he is in contact with Yang Zibin's brigade, operating near Acheng and Yimianpo. On August 24th, he once captured Acheng, but retreated because the Japanese army assisted the puppet Jilin army in defending it very strictly. On September 1st, Yang led more than 2,000 troops, along with about 600 members of the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society, to the vicinity of Weishahe County. The Japanese army stationed in Yimianpo, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched over a thousand cavalry and artillery, riding in armored trains, to resist the enemy. En route, their progress was impeded by the demolition of the tracks by Yang's troops. At the same time, the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society surrounded and launched a fierce attack, trapping the Japanese army in a dilemma of advance and retreat. While the Big Sword Society was surrounding the Japanese army, Yang's main force took advantage of the gap and directly entered Weishahe County. The two battalions of puppet troops originally stationed there collapsed at the sight of them. Those who could not escape in time were disarmed. After entering the city, Yang's troops ordered the merchants to operate as usual. Except for requisitioning food for military use, the rest was left untouched. On the 2nd, the Japanese side dispatched a large number of troops from Harbin, protected by two aircraft, to repair the tracks and quickly drove to Weishahe, linking up with the Japanese army in Yimianpo to launch a fierce attack on Weishahe. They also used two heavy artillery pieces to bombard the city continuously, destroying many houses in the county seat. At the same time, aircraft flew back and forth dropping bombs. Yang's troops were threatened from above and retreated completely towards the Wujimi River at noon. On the 4th, they recaptured the Wujimi River. The details are still unknown.</p>
<p>Wang Delin's Attack on Dunhua Wang Delin and Gong Changhai's troops have formed a connection. Wang's troops deployed from Dongning and Ning'an, taking Dunhua and Jiaohe, to cut off the connection between the Japanese troops on the Jilin-Huiyuan Road and to destroy the construction of that road, coordinating with Gong Changhai's army to capture Jilin. Wang Jin, a foreign technician, set up an arsenal between Ning'an and Tokyo City to manufacture medicines, bullets, guns, and mortars. Therefore, the military supplies have been very plentiful recently. On the 2nd of this month, Wang personally led 4,000 troops to capture Dunhua. A Japanese regiment there was suddenly surrounded in the middle of the night, and they fled in disarray. After a chaotic battle lasting two hours, a captain, a sergeant major, and six sergeants were killed. Countless soldiers were killed and wounded. They left behind two mountain guns and an armored train. The remnants retreated to Huangni River. Wang's troops entered the city on the morning of the 3rd. Currently, Wang's troops in the Dongning area are still being transported to Dunhua, and they will concentrate their forces to advance towards Jilin. The Japanese army stationed in Jilin is unable to provide assistance to Dunhua due to the constraint of Gong Changhai's army. Therefore, since Dunhua was recovered by Wang's army, the market has been operating as usual. In addition, Wang's army attacked Dunhua about a dozen times before, but retreated due to lack of ammunition, with efforts failing at the last moment. It is understood that this place is the shield of Jidong and one of the important points of the Jilin-Huiyuan Road. Now that it has been recaptured, it is as if Jilin has lost an arm.</p>
<p>Gong Changhai's Attack on Jilin Gong Changhai's army is divided into two branches. One branch attacked the Ninth Road of the Jilin-Changchun Line, cutting off the connection between Jilin and Changchun. The other branch attacked Jilin, reaching Longtan Mountain and Wula, east of the city</p>
<p>Over 800 men came from the Jilin-Huiyuan Road to join forces, intending to capture the front of Jilin. The Japanese Second Division has gathered a large force inside the city, erected power grids on the four outskirts, and dug trenches to defend firmly. Although firing has not yet begun, the situation is very tense.</p>
<p>Qiu Zhenhua's Attack on Yushu The newly compiled special operations unit of the volunteer army Xing Zhanqing, Qiu Zhenhua's unit of about 800 men, advanced from Yanshou in mid-August to Yushu. On August 27th, they reached Xiangyang Pao in the Second District of Yushu. First, a small number of infantry used the green gauze screens as cover to advance to Gaojia Bridge, east of the county seat, 20 miles from Yushu County. They also ordered plainclothes troops to sneak into the city and cut the telegraph wires. In the afternoon, Qiu's army was already outside the city. The puppet army Liu Baolin only heard the news and hastily went out to fight. The soldiers had no fighting spirit and collapsed for the most part after a short engagement. The remnants led by Liu retreated to Xinli Village and telegraphed the Japanese army in Changchun and Harbin for assistance. Qiu's army entered the city in the afternoon, ordering the merchants and people to hang the blue and white flag to celebrate. On September 3rd, the Japanese army dispatched a large team of nearly 2,000 men, along with the puppet Jilin-Changchun Railway garrison, to attack. Two aircraft provided cover and dropped bombs. Qiu's army fought to the death, but eventually retreated towards Shulan due to being outnumbered. They will cross the Yitong River to coordinate with Feng Zhanhai's army in attacking Changchun.</p>
<p>Wang Fuchen's Attack on Dehui Wang Fuchen's unit of Feng Zhanhai's newly compiled infantry brigade entered Dehui at 6 a.m. on September 5th. The force numbered about 2,000, and their military appearance was very impressive. The Japanese side dispatched troops stationed in Yushu and the puppet garrison of Jin Bidong to provide assistance, but they have not yet made contact.</p>
<p>Ding Chao's Attack on Fujin The Yilan and Fujin areas were very strained yesterday. It is reported that Ding Chao has led his troops to attack Fujin. The Japanese side is resisting with a detachment, and the battle is quite fierce. Ding's army has abundant military supplies. The Japanese side claims that their heavy artillery's range and power are equal to that of the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese army is already at a disadvantage. In addition, Xu Jingde's Heilongjiang army is advancing from Luobei towards Suidong, intending to advance towards Hegang to reclaim the coal mines. Volunteer armies are蜂拥[fēng yōng] - swarming/thronging - active in all directions, and it is not easy for the Japanese army to cope with them. (September 7th)</p>
<p>Cai Hongyou's Attack on Mulan Cai Hongyou's brigade of the Heilongjiang army, on September 1st, linked up with Li Tiande's brigade and advanced in a roundabout way from the Hebei area, crossing the Tangyuan and Tonghe rivers, and attacking Bayan and Mulan separately. Cai Hongyou's brigade, numbering about 3,000, arrived in Mulan on the 2nd and surrounded the county seat to attack. The local militia rose up in response and disarmed a regiment of puppet troops stationed there. The Japanese 14th Division's infantry battalion was stationed at the pier. At first, they made contact with Cai's brigade, but when they saw the militia's defection, they fled in panic towards Tangyuan. Cai's brigade then entered the city peacefully, digging trenches and building defensive works on the four outskirts and along the riverbank. The local militia, upon receiving Cai's brigade's report that Ma Zhanshan would lead over 3,000 cavalry from Moergen to take Tongbei, and advance to Hailun and Suihua from the side, cheered and voluntarily donated money and food. Therefore, the morale of the Heilongjiang army is very high. A Japanese infantry regiment stationed in Yilan, riding on four puppet river defense warships and six civilian boats, sailed upstream along the river and bombarded the city with heavy artillery from the banks of the Mulan River on the 3rd. Cai's brigade and the militia defended along the river, resisting with all their might. Since the fire started on the morning of the 5th, four Japanese aircraft have dropped bombs many times, but because Cai's brigade had built trenches and defended effectively, the bombs did not have a significant effect after landing. As of today, the 3rd, they are still in the midst of attack and defense. The Japanese side has already dispatched two more battalions from Huachuan to provide assistance and they are currently en route.</p>
<p>Li Tiande's Attack on Bayan Li Tiande's army entered Bayan on September 3rd. The Japanese army headquarters there, stationed with a company of guards, was surrounded and more than 70 men were killed. The remnants escaped back to Hulan on the Guangxin Wheel. The Japanese army has dispatched troops from the Hulan River to provide assistance, but they have not yet made contact as of yesterday. River traffic downstream has been cut off for several days.</p>
<p>Xu Zihe Captures Keshan Xu Zihe and Xu Baozhen divided the Heilongjiang army into two units at the end of August, each with about 4,000 men. Xu Baozhen advanced towards Nenjiang and Nehe to contain the Japanese army in that area, while Xu Zihe went south along the railway line to coordinate with Ma Zhanshan's main force between Tongbei and Moergen. Because the Japanese army on the Qike Road was densely deployed, there were not many clashes along the way, and they all detoured around in large circles. On September 2nd, they advanced to Keshan. Because the puppet Heilongjiang army, under Pu Datong, was stationed there with a thousand men, originally the mainstay of the Heilongjiang army's resistance against Japan after the war, Xu wanted to cooperate with this unit, so he launched a siege on the city. At the same time, he sent people secretly to persuade the leaders of the army. Most of the army agreed and responded by opening the north gate on the evening of the 2nd. Over 700 Japanese troops in the city were caught in a chaotic battle, with nearly half of them killed or wounded. The remnants broke through to Aolonggou. On the 3rd, most of the Japanese troops in Taianzhen rushed to provide assistance, with several aircraft dropping bombs in the air, injuring many people and horses. Xu's troops were unable to defend firmly and abandoned the city to retreat to Baiquan. The buildings in the city were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, and the fire started very fiercely. It was not extinguished until the afternoon of the 5th, burning down about 20 stores and over 200 houses. ▲ Tian Zhaoying's Attack on Qingcheng Tian Zhaoying's army, numbering about 1,500, was also to coordinate with Ma Zhanshan's main force. On September 1st, they transferred from Suiling to Qingcheng. About 300 puppet troops in the city collapsed and fled at the news. The Heilongjiang army then entered the city and is now repairing the city walls and digging trenches, intending to make it a base for the Heilongjiang army's southward advance.</p>

<p>Military Law Department Has Prepared for Transfer</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Zhang Zongchang was assassinated, various circles in Shandong rose up to rescue Zheng Jicheng, sending letters and telegrams in droves, recounting Zhang Zongchang's various crimes and requesting the Central Government to grant Zheng a special pardon. Zhang Weicun, a standing committee member of the Provincial Party Department, also telegraphed various parties on the 6th, advocating a solution between law and human sentiment. The Provincial Party Department also telegraphed on the 9th, requesting the Central Government to grant Zheng a special pardon. Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek replied by telegram, advocating that Zheng be sent to court for trial, and if the sentence was too heavy, then the special pardon regulations could be invoked. The previous process has been detailed in the previous letter. Today, the Provincial Party Department received a reply telegram from the Central Executive Committee: "Telegram received. The case has been approved by the Standing Committee, and a letter has been sent to the Executive Yuan ordering the Ministry of Judicial Administration to transfer the case to the court for handling in accordance with the law. Central Executive Committee Secretariat, Printing Department." Standing committee member Zhang Weicun then took the telegram to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Han Fuqu and the other committee members, showed them the telegram, and prepared everything to await the arrival of the Ministry's dispatch before having Zheng Jicheng brought out by the Military Law Department, preparing a document to send him to court for trial in accordance with the law. It is also heard that the Provincial Government will cite three points in the telegram sending Zheng to court: (1) Zheng Jicheng assassinated Zhang to avenge his father's murder by Zhang, and the circumstances of calmly surrendering himself after killing Zhang at the station on the 3rd; (2) Zhang Zongchang's past deeds in Shandong, for which the Shandong Provincial Government had issued an arrest warrant; (3) Zhang Zongchang was inherently brutal, and Zheng Jinsheng had contributed to the revolution and had been killed, causing his family to be ruined. Judging by the time, the Provincial Government can send Zheng to court based on the Ministry's dispatch within the next week. After the judgment is made, it should then invoke the special pardon regulations to pardon Zheng. (September 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">National Palace Museum <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>National treasures are concentrated in the Palace Museum, passed down through generations for thousands of years. It is a symbol of China's five-thousand-year-old culture. Its historical origins are almost entirely contained within. It is not merely a collection of rare and exotic objects. During the monarchical era, the entire nation served one person, and these items were not easily seen by the people, nor were scholars able to study them. Since the relocation of the palace in 1924, the Palace Museum was established, opening exhibitions and circulating printed materials. This satisfies the yearning of antiquarians and provides material for scholarly research. Almost a decade has swiftly passed, its reputation resounding throughout the world, reaching foreign lands. Repeated translations draw visitors, almost every day. We have always taken pride in being an ancient country with a rich culture. It is only now that this cultural history is being revealed to the world. The treasures within are all related to cultural relics and inspire historical insights. We, the Chinese people, are fortunate to witness these rare treasures and should cherish them and use them to glorify the nation for future generations. However, since the establishment of the museum, there have been many disturbances. Recently, there have been rumors of relocation and even sale. A nation's foundation rests on both cultural virtue and military strength. We cannot emphasize military prowess, which is undeniable. If we cannot even safeguard this cultural area, and we commit an act that even autocratic rulers of the past would not have done, then it is truly lamentable. Therefore, I will briefly describe the establishment of the museum to show the difficulty of its creation, so that the people of the country will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The richness of the museum's collection is difficult to fully describe, and its origin is hard to exhaust. The inspection reports already number in the dozens of volumes, and still are not enough to fully describe the collection. Regarding the establishment of the museum, in summary, it can be divided into several periods. First, I will describe the first period, which is Puyi's departure from the palace.</p>
<p>Puyi's departure from the palace was based on a decision made by the regency council on November 4, 1924. The executors were Lu Zhonglin, then the garrison commander, Zhang Bi, then the police commissioner, and Li Shizeng, as a representative of the people. During the execution, the National Army headquarters first disarmed the 1,200 guards stationed in the Qing Palace and Jingshan, then Lu and others sent representatives to meet Shao Ying and Zhu Yifan, requesting Puyi to leave the palace. After one meeting, Puyi agreed to leave, but stated that personal belongings inside the palace should be inspected, which could not be done in a day or two. Therefore, it was decided that Puyi would leave first, and at the same time, all eunuchs and maids in the palace were informed to pack up their belongings. At 4:10 PM, he left by car to his father's Prince Chun Mansion. At the same time, all affiliated institutions of the Qing court were automatically dissolved. Before leaving the palace, the national seal and the entire palace were returned to the Republic of China. The two old concubines in the palace were temporarily attended to by the palace eunuchs. As for the inspection of items, Shao Ying and three other members of the Qing court, as well as two representatives each from the Republic of China police department and the garrison department, were appointed as committee members. The State Council also appointed Li Shizeng as the chairman of the committee. At the same time, the sealing began, and the organizational regulations of the committee had already been approved by the cabinet. This was followed by the committee period.</p>
<p>During the relocation of the palace, the Beijing government had originally amended the preferential treatment conditions with Puyi, abolishing his honorary title, moving him out of the palace, and providing him with 500,000 yuan annually. However, after the Qing court left the palace, they continued to plot opposition. Therefore, these amended conditions were also implicitly abolished. The committee was formally established on November 20, with a total of fifteen members and three supervisors, and three more individuals were hired. In addition, each ministry sent two assistants. Of the fifteen committee members, five were from the Qing court, but none of them ever attended.</p>
<p>Not long after the regency cabinet was reorganized, Duan Qirui became the Chief Executive, which led to a slight change. He abruptly ordered the Ministry of Interior to instruct the committee to cease the inspection. The committee initially refused to comply, and the Ministry of Interior ultimately supported the committee's position. At that time, the committee was newly established and enthusiastically began its work, disregarding Duan's objections. Eventually, the State Council amended the measures, adding ministers and important officials to the existing committee as a buffer. By that time, Duan's willingness to acquiesce was due to the efforts of the committee members and the mediation of Supervisor Zhuang Yunkuan. Zhuang was known for his integrity and was respected by Duan, and his words resolved the matter. At the same time, the Ministry of Interior still strongly invited the five committee members from the Qing court, but they refused to come, as they intended to restore the monarchy and pursue other avenues, and were determined not to cooperate with the Republic of China. This was a helpless situation. Later, Puyi came to demand personal items, and the committee allowed it. However, the valuable furs and other items taken out of the Shenwu Gate were divided up by the Manchurian officials and eunuchs. Puyi received only a small portion. Subsequently, regarding the land deed of Qingfengsi, the Qing court accused the committee to Duan, while the committee presented evidence of restoration and requested the prosecutor's office to prosecute, in order to counteract the accusation. For a time, newspapers widely reported this. Eventually, the committee's receipt of the land deed was not addressed, and the restoration was not prosecuted by the prosecutor's office because it occurred before the general amnesty on January 1. Therefore, the compromise was likely the only solution.</p>
<p>The fifteen members of the committee were Wang Zhaoming (replaced by Yi Peiji), Cai Yuanpei (replaced by Jiang Menglin), Lu Zhonglin, Zhang Bi, Fan Yuanlian, Yu Tongkui, Chen Yuan, Shen Jianshi, Ge Wenjun, Shao Ying, Zai Run, Qiling, Bao Xi, and Luo Zhenyu, with Shao Ying and the following four as Qing court members. The supervisors were Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, and Zhuang Yunkuan, in addition to the police department, prosecutor's office, and education association.</p>
<p>The committee, recognizing that the Qing court was causing much obstruction and that only public disclosure could prevent it, decided to open the Palace Museum. It was formally established on Double Ten Day in 1925. First, the organizational outline was resolved. The inspection committee went to various palaces to extract exhibits, and the committee elected several directors of the museum, all well-known figures at the time. The opening on Double Ten Day was a great success, with tens of thousands of visitors. From inspection to public opening, the people were able to freely visit, and the Palace Museum became increasingly noticed by the people.</p>
<p>However, after a few months, the Palace Museum, due to political turmoil, transitioned from the period of directors' responsibility to the period of the maintenance committee. After the March 18 tragedy in 1926, Li Shizeng and Yi Peiji successively left Beijing. The museum was managed by a joint meeting of the board of directors, which elected Lu Yongxiang and Zhuang Yunkuan as maintainers. As Lu was not in Beijing, the responsibility fell solely on Zhuang. At that time, the troops were being transferred, and Zhuang consulted with the Ministry of Interior to borrow guards. The Ministry of Interior, seeking to intervene, gladly agreed to transfer its guards and the guards of the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall under its management to the museum. However, the museum strongly opposed the Ministry of Interior's intervention and changed the positions of the officials sent by the ministry to advisors. The Ministry of Interior was displeased but could do nothing. At that time, due to insufficient funding, Zhuang even raised a private debt of 30,000 gold coins to meet the needs. However, on April 23, the Zhili-Shandong Allied Army suddenly sent troops to surround the Palace Museum, forcing it to be vacated. This was unexpected. Wang Shizhen, Zhao Erxun, and others immediately inquired with the Fengtian-Shandong generals, who all claimed to be unaware. Therefore, representatives were sent to negotiate, and the troops surrounding the palace were transferred elsewhere, fortunately resolving the crisis. However, a few months later, the cabinet changed again, with Du Xigui appointed and Wu Peifu effectively in charge. The Qing court, believing that Wu was easy to deal with, sent a letter to the State Council and Wu, seeking to restore preferential treatment. This caused a great uproar, and Wu rejected it. However, the State Council formally approved the reorganization of the museum, with the museum hiring twenty-one committee members and establishing six articles for safekeeping. The hired committee members elected Zhao Erxun as the chairman and Sun Baoqi as the vice-chairman. The museum staff insisted on three principles: no returning to Puyi, no selling, and no destruction. When the old and new were handed over, another handover committee was formed.</p>
<p>As the political situation changed, the affairs of the Palace Museum became the focus of public attention. Therefore, famous scholars established a maintenance association. After several meetings, Jiang Han was elected as the chairman, and Zhuang and Wang Chonghui as the vice-chairmen. Strict rules were established and filed with the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior also approved the establishment, approving temporary responsibility for maintenance. Once the formal organization was established, the association would be dissolved. Therefore, this temporary organization bore this great responsibility amidst the storms.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the maintenance association, it suffered from a lack of funding. Therefore, it was decided to dispose of expendable items, such as gold, silver, tea, and food that were not related to culture. Temporary bidding rules and temporary supervision rules were established, which seemed quite meticulous. When Zhang Zuolin became the Grand Marshal, the State Council decided that the Taimiao and Tangzi should be returned to the Ministry of Interior, and the military archives should be returned to the State Council. At the same time, there were those who advocated for investigation, as Zai Tao was serving as the aide-de-camp to the marshal and wanted to harm the museum. Fortunately, the authorities later realized the importance and, although they made slight changes to the organization, they still retained the committee and hired Wang Shizhen as the chairman, with Wang Shitoong and Yuan Jinkai as the vice-chairmen. This was followed by the period of Fengtian management. The committee hired by the State Council received the museum, and twenty-four secretaries were sent. The system was not changed. After seven months, the revolutionary army arrived in Beijing, and the National Government ordered Yi Peiji to take over. Funding was sought through the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity. The takeover was smooth, although there were some twists and turns with the Summer Palace and the Qing History Institute.</p>
<p>At that time, Jing Hengyi proposed selling and destroying the cultural relics. The museum staff was greatly shocked. Fortunately, Jing's proposal was quickly rejected. The National Government promulgated the organizational law of the Palace Museum and appointed directors, forming a board of directors. The board of directors then elected ten more members and appointed Li Shizeng as the chairman and Yi Peiji as the director, which has remained largely unchanged to this day.</p>
<p>Recently, the disposal of gold and silver has occurred. In fact, the disposal was regulated by the National Government last year, and everything must be done in accordance with the regulations, with the supervision of local judicial and academic circles. However, if the procedures are complete, it is not easy for corruption to occur. However, those who possess treasures are easily misled, and therefore, there are renewed rumors of selling treasures, some saying that the entire collection would be used to purchase military equipment, others saying that some negotiations have already taken place, others saying that relocation is a prelude to sale, and others saying that the main advocate of sale is expressing his anger. In fact, these treasures, which have existed for thousands of years, should not be discussed except for preservation. Moreover, the autocratic system of thousands of years was once overthrown, allowing the Palace to be transformed into a museum. The national essence is the soul of the country, and the people cannot be indifferent to the loss of cultural relics. The National Government had a ban on the export of old books last year. Considering this, wouldn't this be even more important and significant? It is hoped that the rumors are inaccurate.</p>

<p>Strange Robbery in Luzidiaowan In Luzidiaowan, a few people speaking with a foreign accent came to the Yidachang store on the 13th morning, pretending to buy sandalwood. They then used the sandalwood on the counter as weapons to intimidate the people in the store. Wu Shiyuan, a relative of the store owner Yu Huibin, stepped forward to stop them and was injured in the head. The thugs then overturned the counter and robbed silver dollars. The store owner took the opportunity to escape and reported to the police station. The police were dispatched to chase and arrest them. The thugs, relying on their numbers, were not afraid. Police officer Zhang Bingjun was also injured. Another policeman snuck back to get reinforcements. All the police officers at the station were dispatched and arrested one of the thugs. The rest escaped. The arrested suspect was sent to the Fengjing Second Branch for questioning. According to his confession, his name is Guan Shitian, and he works as a laborer on the railroad. Yesterday, he and Sun Laoda came here to settle a store debt and started a quarrel, not a robbery. The store owner also provided a list of lost items and requested a thorough investigation. The Fengjing branch sent him to Songjiang, who transferred him to the county court for investigation.</p>

<p>Victim of Economic Oppression A woman surnamed Zhang from Tingziqiao outside the east gate of this city borrowed clothes and jewelry from her neighbors two years ago because her husband was ill. She pawned them at Jitai Pawnshop for twenty silver dollars to pay for her husband's medical expenses. This year, in September, the pawn period expired. On the morning of the 14th, she took advantage of selling chicken feather vegetables. While passing by Jitai Pawnshop, she added six months of interest to the pawned items. After finishing, she continued to sell vegetables at the small vegetable market. At about 9:00 am, she finished selling and went home. When she arrived at the Daoguan Alley, she discovered that all the pawn tickets were lost. She rushed back to the original road to search, but could not find them. Overwhelmed with anxiety, she committed suicide by jumping into the river near the East Gate. By the time people found her, she had already died. How tragic!</p>

They also opened a Huaxin branch on Tongyun Road in Wuxi and a Huamei Electrical Materials Company in Shuyuan Alley in the city. The businesses were doing quite well. Zhang Jing'an was the general manager of both Suzhou and Wuxi locations. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 12th of this month, Zhang Jing'an contacted his brothers from the three stores and transported valuable goods out before fleeing and defaulting on payments. After checking the business over the years, it was not losing money. It was obviously an intentional default. The total amount owed to various customers and private deposits is about 50,000 yuan. The creditors have now organized a creditors' group and started liquidation.</p>

<p>Robbery of a Lumber Store in Shazhou A lumber store opened by a Qian family in Xigang area of Shazhou City in this county had a large capital and large scale. Unexpectedly, it was recently coveted by bandits. On the night of the 12th of this month, more than 20 bandits, carrying knives and guns, broke down the wall of the Qian lumber store and rushed inside. The store staff were awakened from their dreams and, upon hearing the bandit alarm, tried to flee in all directions. However, the front and back doors were guarded by bandits, making it impossible to escape. One of the staff members, Li, was grabbed by a bandit and forced to hand over silver dollars. Li said that there was no large sum of money in the store. The bandits then searched everywhere, robbing more than 300 yuan from the desk, as well as clothes and miscellaneous items from the staff, totaling about 500 yuan.</p>

<p>Landlords and Tenant Farmers Discuss Autumn Harvest In the coastal and other counties of Jiangbei Yantian area, the autumn harvest is estimated to be about 80% this year. Every time landlords and tenants discuss the harvest, they must be supervised by the provincial committee to avoid disputes. This year, the share of harvest is 35% for landlords and 65% for tenants. The Department of Civil Affairs has ordered the county chiefs of Nantong and Haimen to review and submit the rules.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Military and Police Suppress Hidden Bandits Chen Diaoyuan, the general commander of the First Route in Jiangbei, believes that scattered bandits are causing trouble everywhere in Jiangbei. Since the bandits have dispersed into small groups, the military and police should track them down and suppress them in separate teams. At the same time, he ordered the police chiefs and district chiefs of each county to assist and guide the search. He also ordered a strict review of household registrations. If bandits are found to be hiding, they should be handed over at any time. Those who fail to investigate thoroughly or fail to report hidden bandits will be severely investigated by the county. This will facilitate the suppression. During the suppression, if police officers and security forces in each county are found wearing plain clothes, carrying rifles or box guns, and not carrying the signs of the security forces, they will be treated as bandits and taken back for questioning.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Borrows Money to Help Silk Mills According to letters from silk mills such as Hualun, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce said that recently, due to the sharp drop in silk prices and the impact of artificial silk filling the market, the losses have been considerable. In addition, since the flood, all industries have been depressed, inventory has been piled up, and sales have been sluggish. Although they are trying to resume operations, the silk price continues to fall sharply, and financial turnover is not working. They are bound to stop production. The Department of Industry and Commerce has witnessed the decline of silk and sericulture and is doing its best to maintain and support them. This is because the industry is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Your Chamber of Commerce is the barrier of commerce and will certainly sympathize with the current difficult situation of our mills and provide appropriate assistance. We would like to request 100,000 yuan of the 1 million yuan of construction bonds borrowed from the provincial government by your chamber last year to maintain the current situation. We will abide by your instructions on how to repay it in the future. The letter was forwarded to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Industry and Commerce replied that raw silk is China's main export commodity and occupies an important position in exports. Therefore, the prosperity of silk mills not only affects the livelihood of farmers, but also concerns national tax revenue and should be maintained. We have approved the request and requested the Department of Finance to handle it accordingly.</p>

<p>Xu Mo, Following Luo's Instructions,</p>
<p>Carries Protest Letter and Note Draft</p>
<p>To Shanghai to Consult with Wang and Song</p>
<p>Seeking Final Decision</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the issue of Japan's recognition of the Northeast puppet organization has aroused serious attention worldwide. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to lodge a strong protest with Japan and formally notify the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty of Japan's reckless actions, such as occupying the Northeast territory of China by force and administering it. The notification has already been drafted. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, because Premier Wang Jingwei is in Shanghai for medical treatment and Acting Premier Song Ziwen is also in Shanghai on official business, specially sent Vice Foreign Minister Xu Mo to Shanghai at 8:05 AM yesterday, carrying the notification to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and the protest letter draft, to consult with Wang and Song and make the final decision. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Consulting with Wang and Song After arriving in Shanghai at 8:05 AM yesterday, Xu rested at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At around 10:00 AM, he drove to Premier Wang's former residence on Xipushilu Road to inquire about the final diplomatic decision regarding Japan's recognition of the puppet organization and to express concern for Wang's illness and urge him to return to Beijing as soon as possible. At 11:30 AM, he left with Peng Xuepei, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan. After Xu left, he went to Qiqilu to visit Acting Premier Song Ziwen. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, also arrived shortly after and discussed matters with him at Song's residence and had lunch. Xu left at about 1:00 PM and went directly to the North Railway Station, taking special train P.C. 502 and leaving Shanghai for Beijing at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Xu's Remarks After Xu left after consulting with Wang, a Central News Agency reporter inquired about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy for responding to Japan's reckless recognition of the puppet organization. According to Xu, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already decided on the overall policy for responding to Japan's recognition of the Northeast puppet organization and would proceed according to this established policy. Japan was scheduled to recognize the puppet organization this morning (i.e., yesterday), and our government would receive the official report this afternoon (i.e., yesterday). The protest letter to Japan and the notification to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty would be issued after receiving the official report, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e19">After the Japanese Acknowledge the Puppet Organization <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Various circles express different views</p>
<p>Eager to Acknowledge the Reason</p>
<p>Violating the Convention and Disregarding Dignity</p>
<p>Telegraphing to Request the Recall of the Resident Ambassador</p>
<p>Submitting a Petition Requesting a Clear Order to Suppress</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Discusses the Reuters Shanghai News of the 15th: Chinese Minister of Finance Song Ziwen told Reuters reporters today that the Lytton Report has been drafted and will be released in a few weeks. Is this why the Japanese government is so eager to recognize "Manchukuo"? Is this not saying that Japan is deeply afraid that the Lytton Report will determine that the so-called Manchukuo government is purely a puppet created by Japan, and that the so-called representatives of the people of the Three Eastern Provinces are purely castles in the air? Just look at the rising tide of volunteers in the Three Eastern Provinces, whose momentum is growing daily, causing transportation throughout the region to come to a standstill. Moreover, Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin have been attacked. With the situation like this, to say that the people of the Three Eastern Provinces are eager to create a new nation is simply delirious nonsense. If Japan were to allow an impartial investigation and have nothing to fear, why would it not wait for the results of the investigation to be announced? Japanese soldiers naturally hold a strange theory that if Japan does not recognize the puppet organization it created before the League of Nations meeting considers the Lytton Report, it would inevitably show weakness and lack of determination. However, this kind of theory is only worthy of children whistling in the dark, he said.</p>
<p>Scholars' Opinions According to the Dalu News: Yesterday, the reporter inquired about the opinions of two international law scholars in this port on the Japanese decision to recognize the puppet state. Both stated that the Japanese action is indeed a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, because the signatory countries to the treaty must respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Recently, relevant parties have put forward a new argument, believing that according to the text of the treaty, the signatory countries respect, rather than guarantee, the territorial and administrative integrity of China. According to the opinion of the first expert, respect and guarantee do seem to be different. But, one may ask, how can a country express its respect for the territorial and administrative integrity of another country? It must be by not infringing upon it or causing it any harm. The Japanese claim that the puppet state is the result of national self-determination. Only those who are ignorant of the fact that the puppet state was produced after the Japanese army occupied Manchuria can believe this. In short, regardless of whether there is a difference in the meaning of respect and guarantee, it is not important to Japan, because in any case, Japan has committed the crime of violating the treaty. However, in other countries, these two words have a significant distinction, because if there is an obligation to guarantee, then there is an active obligation to prevent the territorial and administrative integrity of China from being infringed upon. However, Japan's public recognition of the puppet state before the League of Nations meeting is forcing the League of Nations to make a substantial claim. According to the opinion of the second expert, the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty signed with good faith, and should abide by it with good faith. The treaty is not a legal clause, and there are many loopholes. If Japan wants to distort the text to excuse itself, it is easy to do so, because the treaty is a kind of agreement of consent. At the time of signing, it was deeply believed that all countries would be able to faithfully abide by it and be bound by it. Today, the Japanese argument that the treaty is about respect rather than guarantee cannot be called an argument, but can only be regarded as an excuse.</p>
<p>Various Trade Associations Telegraph The various trade associations in this city telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying (titles omitted): The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to the Ambassador Jiang's protest against the recognition of the puppet organization, stated that this is a settled policy and there is no room for change. Today's newspapers reported that the Japanese Privy Council has passed the recognition bill and instructed Mutō to sign a treaty with the puppet state. This has already declared the Three Eastern Provinces to be the second Korea, and China need not ask about it. On the one hand, it is said that China and Japan should maintain friendly relations on a new footing. On the other hand, it is swallowing up the Eastern Provinces and scheming for Chinese interests. This is like strangling someone's throat, causing their death, and yet saying, "I am a good friend to you." This is simply regarding the government and the entire nation as confused and lost. Under these circumstances, the only thing to do is to recall the ambassador stationed in Tokyo, and only give the Japanese ambassador in China courtesy treatment in etiquette, but not engage in official contact, expressing that under these circumstances, there is no way for China and Japan to have any dealings. A little national dignity is retained. At the end of the telegram, the grief and indignation are extreme. Shanghai City North-South Goods Exchange Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Mineral Ash Industry, Flying Flower Industry, Sugar Industry, Intestine Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Mercerized Cotton Velvet Industry, and other sixty-odd trade associations kowtow, deleted and printed.</p>
<p>The General Union Telegrams The General Labor Union of this city telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, saying: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, in your judgment, Japan has already seized the Northeast by force, and has used one hand to create the puppet government of Manchukuo. Our entire nation, in order to maintain sovereignty and preserve territory, vows to never recognize it. All responsibilities should be borne by Japan. Now, the violent Japanese have become even more intensified and unscrupulous, and today they have specially dispatched a plenipotentiary envoy, Mutō, to Changchun to sign an agreement with the puppet state, giving it formal recognition. Its destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty and undermining of international covenants is already obvious. And its hideous and terrifying face has also been completely exposed. This kind of action by Japan has long been expected by us. Our government authorities, at this moment of shattered rivers and mountains, changing territory, precarious national situation, and critical juncture, must decisively order the prompt dispatch of elite troops to launch an expedition, drive out the ugly captives, and restore our rivers and mountains, in order to punish national traitors and protect national rights. At the end of the telegram, blood spurts out, and there is utmost urgency, etc. Shanghai General Labor Union kowtows, deleted.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Standing Committee member Wang Jingwei's condition has worsened in recent days, with a rising fever, and he is temporarily unable to return to Beijing to perform his duties. Therefore, yesterday, he separately telegraphed Central Executive Committee Secretary-General Ye Chucang and the Secretariat of the Central Political Council, requesting an extension of leave for two weeks, and requesting that, as in the past, a member be entrusted to act as chairman when the Central Political Council meets. The two telegrams are transcribed below.</p>

<p>Telegram to the Central Political Council Nanjing Central Party Headquarters Central Political Council Secretariat, my brother's condition has worsened and he needs to extend his leave for two weeks. I respectfully ask you to report to the meeting. When Comrade Jiang was the chairman, he entrusted a member to act on his behalf when he left Beijing for the week. Now that I am one of the standing committee members, I am requesting leave due to illness. Since both Standing Committee Members Jiang and Hu are not in Beijing, it is natural to entrust a member to act as chairman on my behalf during the meeting in accordance with the precedent, in order to avoid the stagnation of party affairs.

After receiving the order, the railway bureau chief, Chen Xinghan, personally went to the station to direct the dispatching of vehicles, including two parlor cars and one third-class baggage car. He also strictly ordered the railway bureau staff to keep the matter secret and assigned railway police to maintain strict security. At about 10:55, Chen ordered the special train to be driven to the Fanhuangdu, arriving at 11:35.

<p>Plans to Rectify Telecommunications</p>
<p>Since Huang Shaoxiong, the acting minister of the Ministry of Communications, took office, he has been supervising the Director of the Telecommunications Department, Zhong E, to earnestly rectify the telecommunications business. Since the technical aspect is of utmost importance to communication, it has been practically reformed. The following is what has been learned about its plans that have been formulated and implemented.</p>
<p>Wired Telecommunications (Lines): The speed of telegraph transmission depends entirely on the smoothness of the lines. Therefore, lines are of great importance to telegraphs. In recent years, due to various reasons, the main and branch lines throughout the country have not been effectively repaired, resulting in decaying telegraph poles, rusted wires, and generally poor condition, which are in danger of collapsing completely. However, repairing the main and branch lines at the same time requires a huge amount of money, which is not easy to raise. Therefore, it has been decided to start by repairing the important main lines, and then extend to the secondary main lines and other branch lines. In 1932, it was decided to purchase 25,000 wooden poles, with 20,000 poles used to repair the main lines and 5,000 poles for repairing the branch lines as needed. (Machinery): The communication machinery currently used in various telegraph offices is mostly of the Western and Morse types. Most of these machines are old and dilapidated, and not very responsive. After investigation, it has been determined to prepare the necessary repaired machinery and dispatch specialized staff to various provincial bureaus to collect and repair them separately, with the aim of completely renovating all the original machinery in the country within two years. At the same time, the Nanjing-Xiaguan-Gulou-Tangshan, Hankou-South Branch, Qingdao-Sifang Cang-kou, Jinan-Inner City Receiving and Dispatching Office, Xuzhou Receiving and Dispatching Office, Beiping-Southwest Branch-North Branch-South Branch-West Branch, Zhenjiang-Danyang-Changzhou-Xiaguan-Gulou, and Jiujiang-Hukou four telegraph lines will be replaced with the Ye Sheng machine to save materials. The Kleinschmidt high-speed motor will be used on the Beijing-Shanghai line. The Western telegraph receiving and transmitting machines will be changed to motor-driven to increase speed and expedite communication. (Batteries): The communication power used by various telegraph offices has always been of two types: dry cells and wet batteries. The annual consumption is very large and is not suitable for high-speed motors. The Shanghai Bureau has been ordered to quickly install storage batteries, and the Nanjing, Tianjin, and Beiping bureaus will also be equipped with storage batteries to implement reforms. (Electrical Materials): The engineering and equipment materials needed by the telegraph offices are mostly purchased from abroad, and the annual expenditure is considerable. To save money, it has been decided to improve the various practical machines manufactured by the original telecommunications machinery manufacturing plant to plug the loopholes. At the same time, the level of the materials that must be purchased should be raised, and the electrical testing laboratory should be asked to test the quality of the materials on-site to ensure that the funds are not wasted.</p>
<p>Telephones (City Telephones): 1. Replacing the Batteries in the Pingjin Telephone Bureau. The storage batteries used by the Beiping Telephone East Bureau and the Tianjin Telephone South Bureau have been used for a long time and their effectiveness has been reduced. It has now been decided to purchase and replace the storage batteries. The equipment for the Ping Bureau has already been installed, and the materials for the Jin Bureau are also in transit. 2. Completing the Automatic Machine Projects in Zhangzhou and Shanghai. After the automatic machine projects in the Zhangzhou and Shanghai bureaus were started, the project in Zhangzhou was suspended for several months due to the flood. The project in Shanghai was delayed due to the destruction of the Zhabei external line project after the Shanghai war. It has now been found that the external line materials for the Shanghai Bureau must be repurchased, and the Zhangzhou Bureau also lacks line materials. It has been negotiated with the original dealer to supplement the materials, with the aim of completing this project in a short time. (Long-Distance Telephones): 1. Regarding the Qingpu Long-Distance Line. The Ministry of Communications previously erected a telephone line through Huangdu to Shanghai due to certain considerations. Now that business between Qingpu and Shanghai is busy, the Qing-Hu section of the long-distance telephone has been opened for public use. The section from Huangdu to Qingpu will be temporarily postponed due to the lack of commercial activity. 2. The Number System for the Jinghu Long-Distance Telegraph. When the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone reports the user's number, the original method was to notify each other on the direct line, which took up the line time and was uneconomical. In order to increase the talk time, a phantom device has been installed on the direct line and a listening device has been added for reporting the number.</p>
<p>Radio (International Radio Station): 1. Ordering Submarine Cables for Remote Connection to the International Station. The original remote connection lines between the International Radio Station and the Central Room used open lines and overhead cables. Due to the losses in the previous Shanghai war, and also due to frequent theft, it has now been decided to use underground armored cables instead. A total of fifty pairs of cables, sixteen miles in length, are required from Shanghai to Zhenru and Liuhang. The Ministry of Communications is already purchasing these materials. 2. Moving the International Branch Station Back to its Original Site. The International Branch Station was originally located at the Maple Forest Bridge in West Shanghai. It was moved to Muir Ming Road this spring because of the incident. However, the location is small and temporary in nature, the equipment is crude, and the operation is difficult. The station has now been ordered to move back to its original site to work. (Domestic Radio Station): 1. Re-equipping the Ningtai Machine. The Nanjing Radio Station's transmitting machinery is of an older model and uses an oil engine, which is very expensive. For the sake of reorganization, personnel have been dispatched to bring the machinery to Beijing for re-equipping. The original site of the transmitting station was rented from private houses. Now, taking advantage of the re-equipping period, the Nanjing Station will be moved to the remaining buildings of the Telephone Bureau to save money.</p>

<p>Japanese Marines Also Tighten Security</p>
<p>According to the Dalu News, yesterday (14th) it was learned that the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, Sakonji, has ordered the Japanese warships under his command to concentrate in the three ports of Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai to prevent accidents after Japan recognizes the puppet state and during China's commemoration of September 18th. This order was decided at a meeting of Japanese naval officers in Shanghai on Tuesday night and telegraphed to the Japanese warships along the Yangtze River yesterday morning for compliance. In addition, the Japanese marines in Shanghai have also tightened security. The Japanese troops stationed in the Japanese factories in West Shanghai have also been increased. However, when the Japanese navy's actions were inquired about at the Japanese embassy, they claimed that they did not know and said that they were deployed by the commander of the Third Fleet and did not involve the embassy or consulates. It was also learned that before the Japanese naval officers' meeting on Tuesday, the Japanese commander had received direct instructions from Tokyo, notifying that the treaty signed between Japan and the puppet state would be signed at 11:00 a.m. this morning in Changchun. At the same time, the declaration of recognition of the puppet state would be sent to various countries, instructing them to take appropriate precautions. As a result, the police of the Japanese consulate here also increased by eighty people yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai from Japan, they were sent to patrol the vicinity of the Japanese embassy and consulate and the areas where Japanese residents live, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Wu Chaochu May Also Arrive Today</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of the Interior Huang Shaoxiong, who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong in mid-August and went to his ancestral home of Guilin, returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Great Eastern Company's President Lincoln. After receiving the news, Mayor Wu specially sent Secretary Tang and municipal government official Zheng Yizhi on the Public Security Bureau's water patrol boat Jiang'an to greet him. At the same time, more than twenty relatives and friends of Minister Huang also went to welcome him.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation The President Lincoln passed the Wusong entrance at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Municipal Secretary Tang, representing the mayor, together with official Zheng Yizhi, led eight police officers from the Water Public Security Team and took the Public Security Team's patrol boat Jiang'an to greet him. The relatives and friends of Minister Huang took the Great Eastern Ferry specially opened by the company. The Lincoln was docked in the middle of the Huangpu River, next to the Great Eastern Company's floating dock. The Great Eastern Ferry and the Jiang'an patrol boat arrived at the ship around 3:30 p.m. The welcomers waited at the pier, and the doctors from the harbor quarantine office boarded the ship to inspect the passengers for about half an hour. Secretary Tang boarded the ship first and then ordered the water police station to strictly prohibit miscellaneous people from boarding the ship on both sides of the gangplank. After about five minutes, Minister Huang was guided by Secretary Tang to the Jiang'an patrol boat and went ashore. The luggage he brought with him was transported ashore by the Great Eastern Ferry. Minister Huang shook hands with the welcomers when he boarded the patrol boat and then went to the cabin to rest. He arrived ashore at 4:25 and drove back to his residence.</p>
<p>Huang's Speech Minister Huang said to the Central News Agency reporter in the patrol boat that he had traveled to Guangdong and Guangxi via Hong Kong this time. He met with Mr. Sun Zhesheng in Hong Kong, and also met with important figures from all parties in Guangdong and Guangxi. The situation in Guangdong Province is very peaceful, and the comrades in Guangdong absolutely obey the Central Government. Under the situation of unity, they are responsible for handling local politics. While in Guangxi, he talked with old friends such as Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi about reforming the politics and economy of Guangxi Province. The so-called reform of politics and economy should take the revitalization of industry and the encouragement of production as the premise. When he returned to Shanghai, he did not meet Mr. Sun Zhesheng when he passed through Hong Kong. It is said that he will take a certain French mail ship coming to Shanghai next time, but he does not know for sure. However, Mr. Wu Tiyun has already set off and should arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (today). The reporter further asked whether the report yesterday that Hong Kong had organized a Southwest Military</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Affairs Branch was true, and whether the minister had heard of this statement when he passed through Hong Kong. Minister Huang replied that he had not heard of this statement, and that it might be a proposal that had not yet been communicated with the Central Government.</p>

<p>The Chinese Authorities in the Concession Strictly Prevented Communists</p>
<p>No Incidents Occurred in the Evening, Passing Peacefully</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities in this city's concession received a report yesterday that the Communists would hold an anti-imperialist conference on the 15th, and took temporary precautions. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Temporary Precautions The Public Security Bureau's district police stations were ordered to double-guard all key roads. Inspectors, detectives, and female inspectors were all on duty, inspecting pedestrians at Ximen and Xiaodongmen. The French Concession's various police stations were ordered to be on alert, with the strictest measures at the intersection of the French Concession and the Chinese area, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, and the intersection of the British and French Concessions. The Public Concession's various police stations issued orders to be heavily guarded in Yinxiang Port, Hudong, and Huxi. Chinese and Western detectives went out to patrol.</p>
<p>Preventing Assemblies Yesterday, the Communists heard that the Public Concession and the French Concession police agencies, which were originally scheduled to gather at the intersection of South Chengdu Road, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, and in front of the Guanghua Grand Theater at 1:30 p.m. to hold a conference, dispatched armed Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to deploy defenses in advance. The inspection of pedestrians in the vicinity was very strict. Although people resembling workers and students were found lingering nearby, they could not gather due to the tight security and dispersed one after another. By 5:00 p.m., the stationed detectives began to withdraw. Everything was normal in the evening, and no incidents occurred.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Officers and Soldiers of the 19th Route Army <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Saving Food to Help Northeastern Refugees</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army, deeply mourns the Northeastern refugees, who are suffering under violent oppression. Two months ago, he organized the Northeastern Refugees Relief Association with General Zhu Qinglan and others to seek relief. Cai, who is in Shanghai this time, heard that the Northeastern refugees have no food or clothing, and is particularly sympathetic. Japan is now disregarding the constraints of international treaties and recognizing the puppet state it created, which will inevitably provoke heated resistance from our country and may cause international disputes, making the situation even more complicated. The Northeastern refugees will be even more distressed and cannot be rescued without long-term assistance methods. Therefore, he advocated monthly donations and holiday collections, donating 5,000 yuan per month to the Northeastern Refugees Relief Association's correspondence address at the Guangzhao Guild Hall at 40 Ningbo Road to be remitted to General Zhu Qinglan in the north for distribution to the Northeastern refugees. There are more than three million residents in Shanghai. If everyone can save a small amount of money and donate it for relief, it will not be difficult to raise a large sum of money. Recalling the enthusiasm of all circles for relief during the Songhu War of Resistance against Japan, it is expected that those who will follow the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army will be very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Donation to the Northeast Volunteer Army - Yesterday's News <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association received notifications yesterday from various donation collection points, stating that donations are increasing daily.

<p>Furthermore, Yan Jun came to the Shen Bao yesterday, claiming to be willing to donate 32 yuan in silver dollars to the Northeast Volunteer Army. He presented a 35-yuan banknote and requested 3 yuan in change. The person handling the transaction, impressed by Yan's chivalrous demeanor, did not carefully check the amount and immediately gave him 3 yuan in change and issued two receipts for 16 yuan each. Shortly after Yan Jun left, the person collecting the donations checked carefully and found that there were only 23 yuan besides the 3 yuan already given. He immediately went out to find Yan Jun to clarify the matter, but he was nowhere to be found. The number of Yan Jun's donation should be clear to him. Even if it was a momentary mistake, he should be able to remember it. It is hoped that Yan Jun will send a letter to the Shen Bao to clarify the matter and ensure accuracy.

<p>The Nanyang Commercial College High School's school buildings were completely destroyed during the January 28th Incident. At the beginning of this semester, the school's students initiated a charity drive to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army. Yesterday, on-site pledges reached over 200 yuan. The school's staff also enthusiastically contributed. It is expected that the results will be very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Representative Cai Xuetian Returned to Guangdong Yesterday</p>
<p>He Spoke About the Decline of National Products and Relief Measures Before Leaving</p>
<p>Cai Xuetian, representative of the Guangdong Shantou China National Goods Maintenance Association, who came north to investigate the situation of national products in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, began to investigate the situation of national products in Shanghai after returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou. The investigation work has largely been completed. Yesterday, Cai took a boat back to Guangdong. Before leaving, he spoke about the reasons for the decline of national products and relief measures. His words were quite pertinent and are specially recorded. He said, "The decline of national products is painful to talk about. However, to summarize the reasons, they can be divided into several points: (1) Most Chinese people cannot practically use national goods, and they treat the promotion of national goods as a fashionable slogan. Therefore, those who advocate national goods in words but still wear foreign goods are everywhere. (2) The government's protection and encouragement of national products is just a piece of empty paper and does not help in practice. (3) There is a lack of talent and insufficient capital, which fails to create a substantial and effective struggle against foreign goods. (4) National products do not have significant progress. Due to environmental factors, the treatment of workers has not been able to satisfy them, resulting in frequent labor unrest and self-destructive opportunities." Due to the above points, national products have no development at all, and the country has become a market for international capitalists. The amount of leakage is incalculable. However, the past is gone, and the future can be pursued. Today, Chinese people should learn from the past and strive to find relief measures. Otherwise, if this continues, the national economy will inevitably lead to total bankruptcy. In my opinion, in the future, (1) domestic media, with their foresight and wisdom, should sincerely and jointly promote national products with enthusiastic people to promote the awakening of Chinese people and unanimously use domestic products. (2) Prevent the destruction of evil forces and give national products a chance to revive. (3) Find ways to reduce the burden on national goods and strengthen the power to fight foreign goods. (4) Train talents for manufacturing national goods, increase the capital for developing national products, and improve the quality of goods. (5) Give preferential treatment to workers to stabilize their lives and achieve effective cooperation. If we can do this, why worry about the lack of prosperity of national products and the lack of foreign goods? In short, now that the country is in trouble, I believe that all living beings can make up their minds to go to the national crisis. However, using active methods to seek the revival of national products (1) can consolidate the national economy (2) can prevent the economic imperialists from coveting our land. This is also a way to save the country," he said.</p>

<p>Returned to Shanghai on the Morning Train Yesterday</p>
<p>Representatives from the car service, machinery, and engineering departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, led by Chen Bohua, standing director of the labor unions of the two railways, went to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Railways, requesting the issuance of two months' worth of war bonuses. This has been reported in this newspaper. After the representatives boarded the train at nearly 11:00 AM on the 13th, with a whistle, no less than one or two thousand workers from various places came to the station to see them off. It is now known that when the representatives went to Beijing, Minister Gu happened to be in Shanghai on official business. They were received by Vice Minister Zeng, who expressed deep sympathy for the representatives' demands and sincerely answered them. He also promised to convey them on behalf of Minister Gu after he returned to the capital. The representatives were very satisfied and took the special night express train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM on the 14th, arriving at the station at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. It is reported that the representatives have considerable confidence in the issuance of bonuses, and Minister Gu will certainly not disappoint all employees.</p>

<p>Went to the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday to Petition</p>
<p>The Employer Refused to Pay for Meals</p>
<p>Party and Government Discussing Effective Measures</p>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the dispute over the closure of the Sanyou Industrial Society in Yinxiang Township, Pudong, has already been legally ruled by the municipal government. However, the employer declared an objection and refused to pay for meals for the second consecutive time, causing panic among all the workers. Yesterday morning, all the workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, representatives Hong Jiaben and Liu Yushan, delegated by the starving workers of the factory, went to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, stating the suffering of the workers and requesting the party and government organs to take effective measures. Then, at about 9:00 AM, more than 600 workers gathered again, wearing symbols, and went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and elected Zuo Zhongzhao, Bao Boyi, Zhang Tingliang, Lian Xinzhi, Wu Renfu, and Qin Haiyan as representatives, who were received by Wang Xianqing. The representatives first stated the purpose of the petition, and the bureau representative expressed acceptance. However, during this period of martial law, the large number of people was an obstacle to local security. The workers were asked to withdraw first and return to the factory, otherwise they would not be able to go to the municipal government together. The workers insisted on not agreeing. Later, Xu Yefu, director of the Third Section, explained in detail to the workers, and his words were earnest, saying that if the employer insisted on not paying, the Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau would seek practical solutions. The workers felt satisfied and returned to the factory in formation.</p>
<p>Representatives Zhong Quan from the Municipal Party Department, Wang Xianqing from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Dong Shihe from the Public Security Bureau, together with Zhang Linhua and Lu Lianqing, directors of the Fifth District Shipbuilding Labor Union, went to the Sanyou Society to negotiate. Because the person in charge of the company avoided meeting, Mei Xiji, an important staff member, was received. According to him, the board of directors had already decided not to pay for the workers' meals. The representatives immediately went to the municipal government to report everything, and Secretary-General Yu and the party and government representatives discussed effective methods, limiting the employer to send the two meal fees to the Social Affairs Bureau this morning, and instructing the labor representatives to receive them at the bureau.</p>

<p>Opposing the Employer's Use of Non-Members</p>
<p>Party and Government Organs Conducting Mediation</p>
<p>All the employees in the candle industry in this city have been provoked by the fact that the sellers violated the Labor Record No. 57 signed by the Labor Mediation Committee on February 2, 1920, resulting in a labor dispute. It is reported that the party and government organs are prepared to conduct mediation. The text of the application submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau by Chen Zenghao and other representatives of the candle industry union is recorded below: It is hereby submitted that the employer does not abide by the contract and uses non-members to work. Repeated negotiations have been ineffective. It is requested to convene both parties to mediate. Before the association was reorganized, it was ordered to be disbanded. Now, it is applying for reorganization according to law. Unexpectedly, the employer did not abide by the contract and used non-members to work when the association was not strong. Repeated negotiations have yielded no results. It should be noted that our labor-capital contract was signed with the industry association in 1920 with amendments by your bureau. Article 4 of the contract stated that the store should only hire members of the union. Now, the employer is using non-members to work, which is obviously breaking the contract and causing disputes. The general members of the association are indignant because the members of the first industry were affected by the Shanghai war. It was requested to convene representatives of various workshops to discuss. The association convened a meeting of representatives on the 11th. It was generally agreed that the current unemployment problem is still unresolved, and the scope of work has been invaded by others. Our workers are forced by life. No matter what sacrifices there may be, they are determined to fight the employer to the death. The association, seeing the serious situation, immediately dissuaded the members from taking any unruly actions and increasing disputes. At the same time, it sent a letter to your bureau, sincerely requesting a speedy convening of mediation so as to obtain a peaceful solution and avoid the expansion of the storm and affecting local security. This is a public convenience.</p>

<p>Mediation Yielded No Results Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Dagongshe, since a conflict between some workers and the factory occurred at the Xiangsheng Iron Factory in Pudong on the 9th of this month, the factory declared a temporary shutdown. Party and government organs have sent personnel to mediate repeatedly, but there have been no results. Yesterday, Zhang Sheng, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Gang, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Zhang Linhua and Lu Lianqing, directors of the Shipbuilding Labor Union of the Fifth District, went to the main factory on Broadway Road at 3:00 PM to conduct mediation again. Bao Naimen, the vice director of the factory, received them. The factory insisted that in addition to the expulsion of 37 workers who caused the incident, the workers in the small work department and the fire department should be changed to rotating shifts. The labor side stated that it was difficult to accept, and the negotiation broke down. The representatives were about to leave, but Feng Si, the director of the factory, persuaded them to stay, and promised to formally negotiate again today in order to avoid the expansion of the storm and facilitate an early solution.</p>

<p>Statement Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Regarding the suspicion that Rentai Rice Store and others were selling inferior goods, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce entrusted accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo to investigate the accounts. Their recent correspondence has been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has replied to the Kaitai Rice Store, saying, "Respected sirs, we received your letter on the 15th of this month and are fully aware of the contents. Our chamber previously instructed accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo to send letters to Kaitai, Santai, Rentai, and Jitai Mountain, requesting them to send their account books to the chamber for review. However, the letter sent to your store at that time was mistakenly written as 'Tontai', so it was not delivered, which led to the misunderstanding reported in the news. We have already forwarded a letter to accountants Pan and Xu explaining this. As for where to send the account books, it is acceptable to send them directly to the accountants' office or to send them to our chamber for forwarding and review. We hereby reply with a letter and enclose the original letter from our chamber dated August 30. Please investigate and handle it as soon as possible."

<p>Stopped Sailing for Five or Six Years</p>
<p>Resuming Within This Month</p>
<p>Hong Kong Customs' inspection of Chinese ships is the most stringent. Ships that are older or slightly non-compliant will not be given a ship's license and will not be able to sail in Hong Kong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hong Kong liners have been jointly operated by Nanhua ships. Originally, there were two ships, Xinhua and Xinchang. After the two ships were wrecked and sunk, none of the company's ships met the regulations for sailing to Hong Kong, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company effectively abandoned the navigation rights to the port of Hong Kong, which has been going on for four or five years.</p>
<p>Negotiations between the Hong Kong Bureau and Shanghai Chinese Ships Although most Chinese ships other than those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company only sail to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou, none go to Hong Kong. Not only have the navigation rights been lost and the shipping business between Shanghai and Hong Kong has been taken by British and Japanese foreign ships, but it also indicates that no Chinese seagoing ship can go to Hong Kong, which is truly shameful. The China Merchants Port Bureau negotiated with Hong Kong Customs and prepared to resume service. After more than a month, it has been successful. Hong Kong Customs has approved the issuance of ship's licenses.</p>
<p>Fair Inaugural Service The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Nanhai liners Hairui and Haixiang have been abandoned on the Longhua River. The Fair is the largest of the company's ships. In order to restore the Hong Kong route, the Fair was sent to the factory for repairs and the passenger seats were rebuilt to comply with Hong Kong Customs regulations. It will soon be completed and is scheduled to start the regular Hong Kong service after the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Foreign Advertising Companies for Unpaid Taxes</p>
<p>Demolishing Signs… Detaining and Fining Workers</p>
<p>Foreign advertising companies have built a large number of advertising signs on both sides of the roads outside the Shanghai International Settlement, and they have generally paid taxes to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities in accordance with the regulations. Recently, the Crowe Advertising Company has been delaying the payment of the advertising tax for the second year. The Bureau of Public Utilities has repeatedly urged them to pay, but they have ignored it. Therefore, yesterday (August 15), the Bureau of Public Utilities sent employees, carrying licenses to dismantle the advertising signs from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and first dismantled two advertising signs at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, advertising Jishi Cigarettes and Goodyear Rubber Tires. The remaining signs will also be dismantled one after another. It is also heard that the company sent workers to paint advertisements at the intersection of Daxilu and Daoxin Road, and they were immediately detained by the Public Security Bureau and fined in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Bureau of Public Works Report <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Work on Reorganizing the War Zone</p>
<p>Damage Reaches 40 to 60 Percent</p>
<p>Property Damage Valued at Over 36 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the war in the areas of Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru in our city, various municipal construction projects have suffered significant damage. In light of this, the Bureau of Public Works has been actively involved in reorganization since the Japanese troops withdrew. The reorganization is now largely complete. Yesterday, the bureau issued a comprehensive report on the work of reorganizing the war zone. The details are copied below:</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army began its withdrawal on May 16th, our side took over the area south of the Songhu Railway and north of the Suzhou River. Subsequently, on May 23rd, we took over Zhenru Town and the area north of the Songhu Railway and west of Yokohama Road. On May 27th, we took over the central districts of Wusong and Jiangwan. However, the area east of the Songhu Railway and west of the Shajing River was not handed over until June 17th. As for the so-called "D Zone," west of the Songhu Railway and east of Yokohama Road, the Japanese army refused to withdraw, and only after more than a month of negotiations was it handed over on July 18th. The first step in the work of the bureau upon taking over was to quickly restore traffic on the roads in the war zone. The area south of the railway was less affected by the fire and was easier to reorganize. The area north of the railway was the center of the war. For example, in the area east of Song Park Road and north of Qiujiang Road, all the houses were destroyed by fire, and none survived. The roads were covered with rubble, some as thick as two meters. Defensive works such as trenches and sandbags were everywhere, especially in the area around Baoshan Road and West Baoxing Road. The road surface was damaged, and the ditches were blocked. The bridges on Yokohama Road were all destroyed. The towns of Wusong and Jiangwan suffered particularly heavy artillery fire, with houses reduced to ruins and scenes of devastation everywhere. Workers were dispatched to clear rubble, fill in trenches, demolish defensive works and dangerous walls, repair roads, clear ditches, and repair bridges to facilitate traffic. Other areas, such as Zhabei Jiaotong Road, Hutai Road, the Jungong Road along the Pu River, and the main roads in the city center, were also severely damaged. Because the regular workforce was insufficient, temporary workers were hired to speed up the repairs. All areas were cleaned up and traffic was unhindered within a few days of takeover. In addition, the Zhenxiang Road and Zhenbei Road, which were built during the war, were also filled with roadbeds and covered with coal cinder. According to statistics, 60% of the roads in the war zone were damaged, 40% of the canals were damaged and silted up, and 50% of the bridges were destroyed. In addition, most of the sidewalks and curbs were cracked by fire and explosions, and many street trees and street signs were also demolished. The scale of the losses is truly shocking and cannot be restored in a short period of time with limited funds. Therefore, the bureau had to weigh the urgency and prioritize reorganization. From May 16th to the end of July, a total of two and a half months, regular workers, temporary workers, and contractors were hired to step up their work, with a total of more than 40,000 workers engaged in the reorganization of roads, bridges, and other projects. The important achievements are as follows: A. Repaired asphalt road surfaces, including Datong Road, Hengfeng Road, Xinjiang Road, Baoshan Road, Guangdong Street, XinJia Road, Changchun Road, Dixiwei Road, Xiangyin Road, and Wusong Wai Ma Road, totaling 9075 meters.

Replenished street trees and branches around the trees 3,898, I. Cleared rubble from various roads, transported sandbags and defensive structures, and filled in trenches, totaling 13,380 cubic meters. As for the area of ​​houses destroyed within the war zone, a total of six districts including Zhabei, Wusong, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, Pengpu, and Zhenru, is about 740,000 square meters, and the area of ​​damaged houses is about 19,000 square meters, totaling 930,000 square meters. It is estimated that the loss should be more than 36 million yuan. After the war, the devastation has not yet recovered, and residents have nowhere to live. Therefore, the Bureau immediately stipulated that the exemption of construction and repair permits would be for three months, and other procedures were reduced as much as possible in order to facilitate. From the cessation of the war to the end of August, a total of 583 free construction permits were issued in the war zone, accounting for approximately 79,000 square meters, which is only slightly more than one-tenth of the destroyed area. The estimated construction value is approximately 920,000 yuan, and 283 repair permits and 170 miscellaneous permits have been issued. This is the situation of the reorganization in terms of construction. At the beginning of the takeover, the Engineering Management Office of Zhabei Minli Road was occupied by the pseudo-Shanghai Northern People's Local Maintenance Association, and all stationery and sundries were searched and emptied, and the books, charts, and tables were torn and messy. The situation of the Changchun Road Workshop and the Xiangyin Road Engineering Management Office in the city center was also the same. The loss of materials and tools is valued at more than 35,000 yuan. In addition, when sandbags were removed from Baoshan Road, Baoxing Road, and other places, 55 abandoned hand-held grenades, 12 bombs, 16 large and small artillery shells, and 3,371 rounds of bullets were found one after another, and they were sent to the Shanghai North Office of the Public Security Bureau and various districts for storage. All offices have now been restored to their original state and are operating as usual, and dangerous objects in the roads have also been removed. This is an incident of incidental reorganization. According to this bureau, the funds for handling the aftermath of the war zone were approved by the municipal government and allocated 100,000 yuan, but only 50,000 yuan was received by September 12, so the above-mentioned projects such as roads, ditches, and bridges were only reorganized selectively within the scope of possible funds. There are still many projects that need to be repaired in the war zone, and they cannot be carried out until the municipal government continues to allocate funds. In addition, houses in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei have been built one after another after the war, and they have all been acquired in accordance with the established road plan, but the road surface after the acquisition, as well as the ditches under the road, have not been paved due to lack of funds, and the citizens are very strict in supervising this, so funds should be raised as soon as possible to start construction as soon as possible to comfort those who are expecting it.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Case Solved in Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Young Hostage Safely Rescued</p>
<p>The Victim's Cousin Masterminded the Crime</p>
<p>Detectives Were Extremely Brave</p>
<p>Six Male and Female Bandits Were Captured One After Another</p>
<p>Dai Wenzhi, courtesy name Zibin, is 37 years old and is from Tiantai Mountain in Zhejiang Province. He is currently working as an accountant at the Yuantai Coal Company established by Liu Hongsheng, a major real estate merchant at No. 6 Sichuan Road. He lives at No. 10 Xicang Lane, Xicang Street, inside Laolao Ximen in Nanshi. Dai is thrifty by nature, and his family is quite wealthy. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. Dai has a young son named Along, who is only five years old. The bandits learned that Dai loved this son like the apple of his eye, so at about 2 pm on August 20th of this year, they kidnapped Along at the gate of Dai's house. At that time, Dai did not report to the police station rashly out of fear, and ordered his family to keep the secret strictly, not to make any noise, hoping to give the bandits a chance to contact him. Unexpectedly, the bandits' hopes were too extravagant, and they demanded a ransom of 100,000 yuan. A total of five letters were received from the bandits, and the family sent people to contact them three times, but the bandits still insisted on a minimum of 70,000 yuan. Until recently, there were still no results. Dai had no choice but to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After a thorough investigation by Detective Captain Lu Ying, multiple kidnappers in this case were arrested around 11 pm the night before, and the hostage was safely rescued from the bandit's lair. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Appointed Time for Negotiation Since Along was kidnapped on August 20th of this year, there has been no news for a full week. On August 28th, the bandits contacted the victim, Dai Wenzhi, for the first time to meet in person at Yaojia Zhushao Xing to negotiate. At that time, Dai was afraid that the bandits would trick him into going and that it would be dangerous, so he did not go. The second time, the bandits sent a letter to Dai asking him to contact him near the Waibaidu Bridge at 3 pm on the 9th of this month. Dai secretly reported to Captain Lu, who immediately sent the foreman Shan Bin, along with detectives Chen Liangfu and others, to join the constables disguised as civilians to go to the scene with the victim to wait for the bandits. However, the bandits did not arrive, so it was ineffective.</p>
<p>Yuyao Contacted Until the third time, the kidnappers suddenly sent another letter asking him to go to the Wufu Railway Station in Yuyao from 11 am to 1 pm on the 13th to negotiate. The letter stated that the visitor must hold three cans of "Beautiful" brand cigarettes and a towel as a sign. After receiving the report, Captain Lu sent the foreman Shan Bin, along with the original detectives, from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the 12th, and then to Wufu Railway Station. At that time, Shan foreman and the victim exchanged clothes and waited near the platform track. The other detectives were ambushed all around, waiting for the bandits to come.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Captured Immediately At 11:15 am, a bandit with a pockmarked face wearing a yuan-colored gown walked slowly. Speaking with a northern accent, he grabbed the left wrist of the Shan foreman and said, "Let's go up the mountain and talk about it in detail," and put one hand into his pocket to pretend to hold a gun. Shan immediately said, "You can talk here." After walking about five or six steps shoulder to shoulder, Shan suddenly flashed back, tightly hugging the bandit. After struggling, he was finally overwhelmed by the detectives and captured. At that time, the victim's brother, Dai Wenrui, had already spotted a bandit who came with him and chased him down.</p>
<p>One Bandit Captured in Shanghai After the two bandits were captured, they were sent to the Yuyao County Public Security Bureau. After a preliminary interrogation, the bandit who was captured first confessed his name was Jin Tianyun, from Sheng County, 29 years old. The bandit who was captured later confessed his name was Zhang Zibing, from Sheng County, 33 years old, who used to work in the Yunlun Silk Factory in Xiaocai Chang, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. He confessed that Ma Huanlao, who hid in the front building on the second floor of Wufuli No. 6, Meiyuan Road, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, sent the hostage to hide in the countryside of Xiaoshan, Shaoxing. Upon hearing this confession, Shan foreman immediately telegraphed Captain Lu, who sent the foreman Liu Shaoqing to go to the address with the Fourth District Chief Police at 12:00 that night and arrested Ma. The Hostage Out of Danger After Ma was arrested, he was taken to the team for strict interrogation. According to his confession, the hostage had indeed been sent to Xiaoshan for hiding. Captain Lu then sent additional detectives to accompany the original staff and the victim to Xiaoshan. At 11 pm the night before, the detective team had received a telegram report from Xiaoshan, saying that the hostage Dai Along had been safely rescued and two male and one female bandits had been arrested. However, one of them who confessed his name was Dai Wenqing, was the victim's cousin. However, Wenqing's brother, Dai Wenbiao, had already escaped upon hearing the news. At 3:30 pm yesterday, Shan foreman and others had escorted the hostage and the bandits to Shanghai. Captain Lu then reported to the director for review.</p>

<p>The Murderer Was Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>The Perpetrator Strenuously Refused to Confess</p>
<p>At around 8:30 yesterday morning, a man wearing a black Indian silk gown was running wildly from west to east on Guling Road. Behind him, another man who looked like a worker was holding a knife and chasing closely. When the man ran to the entrance of the Da Cifu Hotel, he tripped and fell to the ground because a rickshaw was parked in front of him. The worker immediately caught up, stabbing the man several times in the chest and throat with a sharp blade, and then discarded the blade and fled towards Xizang Road. At that time, a man surnamed Dai happened to be passing by and shouted "Murder!" which was heard by the guards nearby. They chased and arrested the murderer, picked up the murder weapon, and took them to the Old Zhabei Police Station along with the witness surnamed Dai. The police station immediately sent detectives to the scene to investigate and transported the body to the Fielun Road Morgue for examination. Then, the police station interrogated the murderer, who confessed his name was Zhang Zimei, from Tongzhou, 30 years old, living at No. 374 Kangnaiduo Road, and worked as a rickshaw puller. He strenuously refused to confess to the murder, so the police station still needs to conduct a strict interrogation.</p>

<p>The Tonghua ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ran aground at Huangsangkou, Qizhou. The bow of the ship was stuck in the sand. Initially, the Lijitunan two ships were sent to tow it, but Tunan's military transport was tight and it was inconvenient to help tow. Therefore, the Lijitunan was weak and unable to rescue it, and the Tonghua's bow was stuck in the sand, which was quite dangerous. Yesterday, the chief captain of the bureau personally went to Huangsangkou to investigate, and ordered the Jiangxin ship to depart at noon yesterday to assist in towing. According to Wang Tong, the director of the shipping department, the tide was expected to rise yesterday afternoon, and it was hoped that the towing would be successful.</p>

<p>Director Xu Unreasonably Assaults Postal Worker</p>
<p>The Postal Administration of the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration in this port has a postal inspection office stationed there, with more than 20 inspectors. They work in shifts every day, inspecting reactionary mail in various post office rooms. Yesterday morning, the director of the office, Xu Zhenliu, was taking the stairs to go upstairs, accidentally touched the elevator door machine, suspected that the machine was deliberately treating him badly, and was instantly furious. He beat the driver, Li. Li reported to the postmaster that the officer had assaulted him for no reason, and that the officer was the director of the postal inspection office, but had such barbaric behavior. Xu not only did not admit his mistake, but was also strong and insisted that Li was disrespectful to him and deserved to be beaten. Later, the whole postal workers heard about this matter, and all were resentful of Xu's arrogant and bullying attitude towards postal workers. It is said that the postal authorities believe that a postal civil servant was unreasonably beaten, and have made serious representations to the competent authority of the office.</p>

<p>Qian Guan Jin's seven-year-old only son, Miaofu, who lived at No. 7, Lane 206, Pu'en Jishi Road, French Concession, was suddenly kidnapped and hidden while enjoying the cool in the patio at 7 pm on July 20th of this year. A huge ransom was demanded. Jin Jiulin, detective inspector of the special agency of the French Police Station, and detectives Li Yaolong and Zhang Ziying, and the patrol detectives, arrested the kidnappers Wei Youwen, Wang Shaoqing, and Xu Dashunzi from Jiangbei, and rescued the hostage on a small boat in the river at the bottom of Haige Road and escorted him home. After the police station completed the investigation, Wei and others were sent to the Second Special Zone District Court for public prosecution.

<p>Not Ashamed of His Low Status</p>
<p>Only Loves His Excellent Character</p>
<p>Xi Huiyun, the 18-year-old daughter of Xi Zixiang, who lives at No. 109, Furun Lane, Nine Mu Di, in the city, is very beautiful and graduated from Wanzhu Primary School. She is currently studying at Jinde Junior High School. Unexpectedly, she fell in love with the patrol officer Ni Shizhong (25 years old) of the Second District, First Station, Yangzhou. An old woman, Xu Yan, introduced a small house to them at the Tang Feng's house at No. 2, Jiujian Lou, Qiaojia Bang, and Huiyun eloped and left home. Later, her father sent out detectives to find Huiyun first, asked about the previous situation, and also arrested the police officer, together with Xu Yan and others, and twisted them into the Third Station of the First District. During the interrogation, Xi Huiyun claimed that the love was real, but she had asked Ni to break off the relationship, and this time she was coerced into abduction, etc. They were immediately escorted to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the District Court yesterday. The prosecutor conducted a preliminary hearing, and Huiyun said that when she began to fall in love with Ni, during the summer when they were cooling off, his post was in front of the door, and they loved each other and became lovers. "I am not ashamed of his low status, I love his excellent character. I agreed to borrow a small house to escape, and what I said before was listening to Qian Alin's words, and my father also listened to Qian Alin's words to destroy our good deeds," etc. When questioned about Ni Shizhong, his confession was also similar. Xu Yan's confession was vague. The official ordered them to be detained together, waiting for the informant to arrive for further handling.</p>

<p>Organized Stone Throwing Agency</p>
<p>Three Abducted Children Rescued</p>
<p>Lu Gendi, Ding Huaguo, Sun Jishan, and other Chinese detectives of the Xinzha Police Station, learned that there were Fujian gang members organizing a stone-throwing agency (i.e., a cut for trafficking in young boys) at No. 1144, Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road, who specialized in buying children and reselling them to Fuzhou and other places to make a profit. So, at around 6 am the day before, they secretly went to the address and arrested Chen Changgen, Wang Renli, Hong Jinchuan, Weng Qixiong, Lin Kangzeng, and other five people, and recovered three abducted children: (1) Ma Qiming from Chongming, 6 years old, (2) Xie Xiaolin from Yangzhou, 5 years old, (3) Shi Xiaofa from Chongming, 6 years old. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Zone Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that he was now accusing the defendants of violating Article 358 of the Criminal Law on harming families and Article 313 of the Criminal Law on obstructing freedom. However, the families of the abducted children in this case have not yet been identified, so he requested a postponement. After Wu Tingqi, the prosecutor, reviewed the case, he questioned the defendants and the children briefly and ordered them to be returned to custody, pending verification at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Sanitary Inspector's Extortion Exposed <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Accused of Negligence of Duty and Obtaining Property by Fraud</p>
<p>Qian Guisheng, a sanitary inspector from Pingliang Road Works Bureau and a native of this county, went to the vendors of the Wuzhou Road Xiaocai Chang from the 5th to the 9th of this month at around 2 pm, pretending to be instructed by foreigners to move the noodle stalls and other 13 households to the second floor for business. Because the upper floor has no roof and is open-air, customers are inconvenient and no one patronizes. They begged him to find a way to ban it, and Qian asked for 300 yuan. As a result, 250 yuan was negotiated. Because one of the households could not raise enough money, it fell short of 28 yuan, which was all taken away by Qian, indicating that they could still live in the old place. Unexpectedly, the chief foreigner of the sanitation department received an anonymous letter in Western text the day before, stating the above facts, and since there was no such move in the bureau, Qian Guisheng was sent to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Zone. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the previous situation, claiming that the police accused the defendant of negligence of duty and obtaining property by fraud, please investigate. Now all the stallholders have arrived in court, etc. According to Zhang Zigui's statement, he set up a noodle stall on the lower floor of the Xiaocai Chang. The defendant came to tell him that it was unsanitary and needed to be moved to the upper floor for business. When he discussed with him, he attributed it to the foreigner and wanted 300 yuan. After repeated negotiations, the stallholders gathered 222 yuan and handed it over to the defendant for counting on the second floor of the Xiaocai Chang. He claimed that there was still a shortage that must be made up, and then took the money away, etc. According to the woman Wang Houshi, who is also a noodle stall vendor, her testimony was the same as Zhang's, and she also claimed that there was a shortage of 28 yuan because Yan Laigen, one household, did not pay, etc. According to Yan's claim, the defendant said that it was foreigners who wanted the money, not him, and he did not get any of it because he had no money. Questioning the defendant's confession, the money was all taken away by the Western staff member named Nkon, and he did not get any of it. The Westerner is going somewhere on the 11th and is expected to return in about a week. The rest of his confession was vague. Prosecutor Fu Lin ordered him to be returned to custody, and the hearing was postponed to wait for the Westerner to arrive for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Judgment for Embezzlement of Printing Costs <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Henan Provincial Geological Survey recently commissioned the Shanghai Yuanfeng Printing Company to print 500 copies of a report. After accepting the commission, the company intended to subcontract the printing to another printing house. Therefore, they instructed their salesman, Ye Weiru, to contact other printing houses. Ye then claimed that the printing had been undertaken by the Meihua Printing House, and Yuanfeng accordingly gave Ye 680 yuan to be forwarded to Meihua as printing fees. Later, as the agreed deadline passed and Meihua still had not delivered the goods, Yuanfeng contacted Meihua regarding the order and discovered that Ye had been lying. The money had been entirely used by Ye for his own purposes. The matter was reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Ye. Yesterday, he was brought before Chief Judge Qian of the First Special District Court. Ye confessed that he had used the money for funeral expenses, but claimed that the report was already in the process of being printed, and only a slight extension of time was needed. Defendant's lawyer, Yan Luqing, defended the defendant, requesting leniency. Judge Qian concluded the interrogation and immediately pronounced judgment, sentencing Ye Weiru to three months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Xu Yucheng's Response <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>to the Indictment for Property Encroachment</p>
<p>Xu Yucheng, a shareholder of Hengtong Qianzhuang, was sued by his nephews, Wenrong and Wenxin, who together retained lawyer E Sen, for encroaching on jointly owned public property under his management. The case was once heard in the First Special District Court. The court ruled that the accounts submitted by the defendant required further examination and ordered further investigation. This has been reported in the newspapers. Now, the defendant has entrusted his lawyers, Yang Linzhi and Ye Shaoying, to submit a statement detailing the management situation over the years, and has also filed a counterclaim. The statement roughly states: "My late father, Xiaoyun, had three sons: the eldest, Shiming (deceased, father of the plaintiff Wenrong), the second, Shizhong (Yucheng), and the youngest, Shiheng (deceased, father of Wenxin). Their estate was divided in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign (1905), with written records as proof. At that time, my late mother, Lady Zha, was still alive, so my late father's</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>estate was divided into four portions. The three remaining sons each received one portion, and the remaining portion was reserved as public property for the expenses of my mother during her lifetime, for her funeral arrangements after her death, and for other public expenses. In the eighth month of the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign (1906), I, Yucheng, was working in Beijing. The aforementioned public property was managed by Shiheng for four years and two months. In the tenth month of the second year of the Xuantong reign (1910), Shiheng passed away. I, Yucheng, returned from Beijing to my hometown to audit the public accounts of my deceased brother, and found a deficit of over 1,000 yuan. In the third month of the third year of the Xuantong reign (1911), I, Yucheng, requested leave to care for my elderly mother as I was the only able-bodied son at home. I also returned to the south to make arrangements for a memorial hall to be built for my late father in Beijing. Therefore, the public accounts were handed over to Menghua for management (Menghua is the elder brother of Wenrong). In the ninth month, I returned south and found a deficit of several hundred yuan in the public accounts. It was then that the Xinhai Revolution occurred and the family fled to Shanghai for safety. The second month after that was the first year of the Republic (1912), and it was then that I, Yucheng, began to manage the public property together with the members of each branch of the family. Upon investigation, the income of the public account was originally not much. After moving to Shanghai, expenses increased sharply. The rent and rice expenses for each branch of the family were all paid from the public account. Since April of the fourth year of the Republic (1915), each branch of the family paid for their own rent and rice. My late mother, Lady Zha, was over seventy years old, and we dared not be frugal in providing for her. The plaintiffs lived with my late mother in Shanghai, but did not know that all expenses were paid from the public account. This is the situation of the public accounts from the first year of the Republic (1912) to the twelfth year of the Republic (1923). The expenses for my late mother's birthdays and funeral arrangements are all recorded in the account books and can be easily verified. After my late mother passed away, the expenses of the public accounts decreased. I, Yucheng, following my late mother's wishes, allocated 600 shi of paddy land rental from Pinghu to her eldest and second grandsons, valued at 20,000 yuan. In addition to the above, the income and expenses over the years are all supported by detailed account statements. Except that the plaintiffs have taken away three account books and refused to return them, making it impossible to complete the final accounting, all other account documents have been audited and categorized by accountant Wang Sifang, listing everything without omission. I, Yucheng, am over sixty years old and suffer from many illnesses, making it difficult for me to write and calculate. It is unavoidable that things have piled up, but the management of public accounts is a completely unpaid service. I dare not hire an accountant, and each branch of the family should understand this. Moreover, the plaintiffs and I are akin to father and nephews, and if they had any conscience or knew even the most basic etiquette, they could have directly investigated the accounts or convened a family meeting. Why resort to litigation in the public court over the estate of our ancestors? Furthermore, the plaintiffs stated in their complaint that from the twelfth year of the Republic (1923) to the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), the interest on pledges and the remittance of rents and land taxes to Yucheng amounted to a total of 55,929 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 5 li. After deducting the expenses of the Haiyan Accounting Office and the public accounts, there should still be 39,912 yuan and 3 jiao in savings. However, after my late mother passed away, the expenses for her funeral arrangements alone amounted to over 16,200 yuan, which the plaintiffs ignored, writing it off with a stroke of the pen. It is heartbreaking to speak of this. They also claim that I, Yucheng, cannot point out where such a large sum of money is deposited, and that the accounts are also missing, using this as evidence of my embezzlement, which cannot be refuted. How can they not know that the accounts I handed over, covering the period from the twelfth year of the Republic (1923) to the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), show that the amount received was 74,178 yuan, 1 jiao, and 6 li, which exceeds the amount mentioned by the plaintiffs by over 20,000 yuan? This shows that the plaintiffs are not clear about the amount of income and recklessly accuse others of embezzlement. Their slander and framing are self-evident. Furthermore, if I, Yucheng, had any intention of embezzling, why would I admit to receiving more than 20,000 yuan more? This alone is enough to prove my honesty and impartiality. I, Yucheng, have been reading books since childhood and have a basic understanding of etiquette. For decades, I have been dedicated to public affairs, and I know the difference between righteousness and profit. Not only have I never set foot in a public court, but I have also rarely had disputes with relatives and friends. Now, to be accused by my nephews of embezzling thousands upon thousands of yuan, of embezzling every minute detail, of having the ambition of Mount Tai not refusing any soil, and of the tolerance of the rivers and seas not discriminating against small streams, their intention is nothing more than to destroy me through condemnation. I, Yucheng, only have the virtue of walking alone, but lack the virtue of influencing others. In seeking the reasons within myself, I cannot face my ancestors in the afterlife. Thinking of this, I am filled with fear and remorse. I have separately compiled a detailed list of income and expenses over the years and request the court to verify them one by one. If there are any false reports, exaggerations, embezzlements for personal gain, I am willing to be severely punished to uphold the law and apologize to my ancestors." In the counterclaim, it is stated that he has only daughters and no sons. Recently, the National Government promulgated the law on women's inheritance of property. His two nephews have no hope of inheriting his property, so they are using the public account as a pretext to covet his property, making a fuss over a minor issue. It is obvious that their intention is to subject him to criminal penalties and to file a private prosecution. The plaintiffs have violated Article 180 and Article 181 of the Criminal Law regarding false accusations, without any doubt. Therefore, according to Article 365 of the Criminal Law, he is filing a counterclaim.</p>

<p>Having read the report in your newspaper (15th) about the eye-gouging case of the Ding family, I am very shocked. I have been living in Zhabei, Shanghai, as a tailor. Last autumn, I brought my family back to my hometown and reclaimed the ancestral farmland for my own cultivation. Since then, I have incurred the resentment of my clan. This time, due to drying sorghum husks, I had a dispute with Ding Changxian. At first, I was beaten by a mob, and then both of my eyes were gouged out. I did not expect the villains to be so ruthless and have committed such a heinous crime. I have an elderly mother above me and a wife and children below me. My whole family relies on making a living. Now that I have suddenly lost my sight, my livelihood is cut off. As for the matter of not engaging in proper work and stealing clothing from the clan, which has damaged my reputation, I think your newspaper's report is inaccurate and should be corrected as soon as possible. I sincerely ask the gentlemen of the Shen Bao newspaper to take note. Yours truly, Ding Achun. September 15th, 21st year of the Republic.</p>

<p>Should Stop Sports</p>
<p>The painful commemoration of the Northeast's fall on September 18th coincides with a Sunday. According to common practice, Sunday is a holiday, and sports competitions are more frequent than usual. However, this Sunday (September 18th) also has important advanced singles semi-finals in the grass tennis tournament. To commemorate the painful September 18th, all competitions under the auspices of the China National Sports Federation should be suspended. Moreover, for those presided over by Westerners, our compatriots should refrain from participating on that day. Mr. Qin Shouou, who is concerned about this matter, sent a letter, which is transcribed below. It is hoped that patriotic Chinese people will pay attention.</p>
<p>(Omitted above) I read in the newspaper that the singles semi-finals between Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, and Zheng Zhaojia and Defu, will be held this Sunday at the French Chamber of Commerce. Upon investigation, this competition was originally scheduled for today, but the French Chamber of Commerce, for the sake of its income, specifically postponed it to Sunday. However, it has been found that Sunday happens to be the commemoration of "September 18th." The government has already issued a nationwide order to suspend entertainment. Since Lin, Qiu, and Zheng are Chinese, and tennis is also a form of entertainment, it is an undeniable fact that they should comply with the order to suspend the competition. I sincerely hope that your newspaper will publish an article opposing holding tennis matches on "September 18th" and ask you to inform other newspapers to advocate this position together. Your newspaper is enthusiastic about patriotism, and it must not be less than this humble person. I eagerly await this. Respectfully, Qin Shouou, September 15th.</p>

<p>Lin and Qiu Enter the Finals Week</p>
<p>Although Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang Lost</p>
<p>Their Skillful Advancement Was Applauded by the Audience</p>
<p>| Defu and Huite Also Secure Final Rights |</p>
<p>The final of the Shanghai Grass Tennis Club's Doubles Championship saw Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai face Defu and Huite. The results of yesterday afternoon's semi-finals at the French Chamber of Commerce were: (1) Defu and Huite narrowly defeated Mei Hamsi and Beilunsi in five sets. (2) Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai defeated Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang in straight sets.</p>
<p>Encountering Strong Opponents, a Hard-Fought Victory</p>
<p>Defu and Huite, an unexpected strong opponent, confronted Beilunsi and Mei Hamsi, one tall and one short, one high and one low. They almost thwarted Defu and Huite's hopes of winning the championship. Beilunsi utilized his height, smashing everywhere, and his fast shots along the sidelines were especially accurate and powerful. Although Mei Hamsi was short, his net play was not inferior, and his high balls were also quite accurate and commendable. Their coordinated advances and retreats made the veterans sigh in admiration.</p>
<p>The Arena Resounded with Smashes The situation in this group was that both sides aimed to win by smashing. Beilunsi and Mei Hamsi exerted all their strength to smash, and they won two sets entirely due to this. Furthermore, Defu also excelled at this, so the entire arena resounded with smashes.</p>
<p>Strategic Error In the first set, Defu and Huite's balls were often out of bounds, coupled with the fierce smashes from Beilunsi and Mei Hamsi. After 2-2, Defu and Huite lost three consecutive games, trailing 2-5. Only then did they realize the error of trading smashes and switched to accurate high balls, winning back three games to tie at 5-5. However, at 7-6, they suddenly lost two more games. Finally, after many "equal" games, they won the first set 10-8.</p>
<p>Defu Shows His Colors Although Defu and Huite narrowly won the first set, they lost the second set 4-6 under the heavy pressure of their strong opponents. They tied at 4-4 and then lost two consecutive games. With each side winning one set, Defu displayed his colors in the third set, resuming his fierce and accurate net play and smashing, which was crisp, refreshing, and impressive. After 3-1, they relentlessly won three more games, winning the third set 6-1 and taking a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Impatience Leads to Failure However, things turned out unexpectedly. In the fourth set, Beilunsi and Mei Hamsi again tied the score at 2-2 with a 6-2 win. In the final decisive set, Beilunsi and Mei Hamsi failed due to impatience. Defu and Huite took a 3-2 lead. Mei Hamsi then lost a serve, putting them in a disadvantageous position. Subsequently, Defu and Huite rallied from 1-3 to win the set 5-2. In the final game, Beilunsi committed two double faults, practically handing over the victory.</p>
<p>The Veterans Won, but the Youngsters Showed Their Prowess</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang</p>
<p>Although Lin and Qiu won in straight sets after a fierce battle, they had actually gone through a tough fight. In the third set, Zheng and Yu took a 4-3 lead, seemingly poised to win a set. However, in several games, Zheng and Yu had led 3-1 but were overtaken by Lin and Qiu.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Highly Praised Zheng Zhaojia's performance has shown a glimpse of his recent improvement in skills. His serves were heavy and powerful, and his shots demonstrated his ability to concentrate his power. His cross-court shots flew like arrows, and Lin and Qiu rarely returned them. His strategy was also good, using high balls to force Lin and Qiu back, all very accurate, especially in the third set.</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang's Weaknesses Yu Tianguang's performance yesterday can also be considered a brilliant one. Against such strong opponents, it should be judged differently. His shots were also powerful, and his net play was excellent. However, his weakness was his lack of courage. In the first two sets, his high balls were too close, all falling into Lin and Qiu's hands. However, he performed much better in the third set, with his heavy cross-court shots from the baseline often hitting inside the net. He should be further trained.</p>
<p>Score of the Re-Semi-Final Zheng and Yu defeated Tuina and Kelinuofu to gain re-semi-final rights, with a score of 14-12, 6-2, 6-2.</p>

<p>Donghua Heavily Defeats Lincoln</p>
<p>Seven Thousand Fans Are Overjoyed</p>
<p>Lincoln Suffers a Crushing Defeat 5-2</p>
<p>| Tragedy on the Field: Lincoln Player's Leg Bone Fractured |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Donghua Football Team faced Lincoln with full spirit, and as a result, Donghua won a resounding victory with a score of 5-2, marking Lincoln's first defeat since arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday also coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, and various sectors were on holiday, so the attendance at the match was exceptionally enthusiastic, estimated to be over 7,000 people. The baseball field was completely filled, a rare sight. The performance was brilliant, and everyone who watched was overjoyed, adding much color to the auspicious day. However, the tragedy of Lincoln's left inside forward, Lix, breaking his leg bone was a blemish on the otherwise perfect day. The details are described below.</p>
<p>Donghua Excels in Both Offense and Defense Donghua's defenders cooperated well. Feng Yunyou marked Lincoln's center forward, Tu Kaiyuan guarded the tiger general Kou Kehanmu closely, Wu Youliang marked the left-wing, Li Ning and Guan Xun'an marked the two inside forwards, and Lu Zhongen defended the goal. Everyone performed their duties and was well-prepared and impeccable. The short passes of the forwards Chen Jiaqiu and Chen Yutian were extremely skillful, making it impossible for the opponent to predict. Qian Jingyong was as brave as ever and made many wonderful passes, contributing greatly. Cao Qiulin's shooting was strong, but he was too timid. In summary, the whole team was energetic and full of vigor, but the performance was slightly slow. The lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an (Wang Changying replaced him), Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Qian Jingyong, Wan Xianghua (Chen Hongguang replaced him), Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Yutian, Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Lincoln's Lineup Has Adjustments Lincoln's lineup was slightly different from the first match. The famous general Barnes Pei did not play, and Lix only entered the game in the second half as the left inside forward, unfortunately suffering a broken leg bone. Yesterday, the two new generals, Lie Lai and Tailai Te, played in his place, probably for training purposes, so their strength was greatly reduced. The forward line was extremely disorganized, and at crucial moments, there was a lack of coordination. The lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Hayes, Asher, Turner, Ke Ke, Babu, Tailai, Baierte Lai, Lix (Lie Lai replaced him), Hixins, Lie Tailai, Kou Kehanmu</p>
<p>The Final Score is Five to Two In the first half, Donghua was at its peak, winning three goals. Chen Hongguang left the field due to abdominal pain at 25 minutes, fighting with ten men. Before long, Lincoln's left inside forward, Lie Lai, also left the field due to foot pain, both sides fought with ten men. Donghua's defense was tight and safe, while the forwards bravely pressed forward. First, Chen Jiaqiu scored a penalty kick, then Cao Qiuting shot from afar, and finally Chen Jiaqiu shot in front of the goal, scoring three consecutive goals. In the second half, the situation was slightly worse. Donghua's inner guards seemed to be negligent, leading to the loss of two consecutive goals in a stable situation. However, the loss of the second goal was actually due to Lincoln's left-wing Baierte Lai being in an extremely obvious offside position, but he was allowed to score directly into the net. Neither the referee nor the linesmen noticed, so Donghua's loss of this goal was extremely unfortunate. With Lincoln scoring two goals, the situation suddenly became serious. Donghua then worked harder and relied on the cooperation of the forwards, with Jiaqiu and Yutian each scoring a goal, ending the game with a score of 5-2.</p>
<p>Donghua's Momentum Surpasses Lincoln At 3:00 PM, referee Kelilai ordered the game to begin, with Lincoln attacking first, advancing step by step. Getting a free kick, Lu Zhongen jumped up and caught the ball, sending it to the front. Chen Jiaqiu's attack was ineffective. Wu Youliang and Cao Qiuting forced a corner kick, which Lincoln headed to clear the danger. The ball then turned to Donghua, and the corner kick was cleared. Chen Hongguang, single-handedly, went deep into the enemy territory. Lincoln's goalkeeper rushed out 15 yards and kicked the ball out first, averting the danger. However, Donghua's offensive was extremely strong, clearly above Lincoln. Qian Jingyong frequently won corner kicks, surrounding and attacking the goal, but none were successful.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Opens the Record At 15 minutes, Chen Yutian sent the ball to the right, and Cao Qiuting dribbled forward. The ball touched Lincoln's left inner guard's hand, and a penalty kick was awarded. The audience immediately rejoiced, feeling proud. Chen Jiaqiu kicked the ball into the right corner of the goal, very clear, and the record was opened. Five minutes after the center kickoff, Donghua Guan Xun'an kicked an offside ball. Chen Jiaqiu received it and dribbled forward. Lincoln's goalkeeper ran out again to kick it, but the ball was obtained by Cao Qiuting, who immediately sent it to the goal. The goalkeeper ran back but had not yet settled his feet and could not turn around to save the ball. Thus, the ball was sent into the left corner of the goal by Cao, and Donghua scored two goals.</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu Records Another Achievement From then on, Donghua's momentum grew stronger, and Lincoln's defense could not defend against it. Chen Hongguang got a free kick in the enemy territory, but Qian Jingyong's pass was too wide and ineffective. Then, Chen Jiaqiu forced a corner kick, and Qian Jingyong's cross was good, but it was saved by the goalkeeper. Just as one wave subsided, another arose. Little Qian got the ball from Lincoln's right inner guard's foot and passed it in front of the goal. Chen Yutian stopped it and passed it to Jiaqiu, who lifted his foot and shot, hitting the goal again. The ball went low into the corner of the goal, very skillful. Soon, the first half ended, with Donghua winning three goals.</p>
<p>The Battle Resumes, and a Tragedy Occurs After the lemon juice, the game resumed. In one instance, Cao Qiuting ran forward to grab the ball and shot forcefully at the goal, but the ball went out of bounds. Lincoln then launched an attack. After several back-and-forths, Lincoln's left inside forward Lix dribbled the ball forward. Li Ning rushed forward to grab it, with great force. Lix immediately fell to the ground. Lix's foot was broken with skin and bone. He was rushed off the field and given first aid by Lincoln soldiers and officers present, before being sent for medical treatment. It is feared that he will be disabled.</p>
<p>Two Consecutive Goals Shock the Audience Donghua continued its fierce attack, and Lincoln's goal was under siege on all sides, with shots coming from left and right like raindrops, but many were unsuccessful. Wan Xianghua saw a high ball and headed it, but it went out of bounds again. Lincoln suddenly counterattacked, and Donghua's defense, which had been safe for a long time, suddenly became negligent. After Kou Kehanmu broke through the defense line, he passed the ball in front of the goal, and the right inside forward shot the ball, which went into the net. In less than three minutes, Lincoln's left-wing received a pass from the backfield, penetrated the defense alone, and went straight to the backfield. Wang Changying failed to stop him, and Li Ning's attempt to stop him was also ineffective, allowing him to dribble to the front of the goal and score. However, this person was already offside, but it was not penalized. Donghua lost two consecutive goals, and the audience was immediately terrified.</p>
<p>Chen Jia Will Serve the Country Faithfully Seeing that the situation was not good, Donghua renewed its efforts and became stronger again. Not long after Lincoln scored two goals, Chen Jiaqiu retaliated with a goal. This goal was first shot by Chen, and the goalkeeper fell to the ground and knocked the ball to the ground. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, but Chen Jiaqiu still managed to kick it in. Chen then left the field due to abdominal pain for a short rest. He re-entered the battle five minutes later, and the audience applauded him. Chen Yutian and Wan Xianghua were also not to be outdone, cooperating and advancing together. Not far from the goal, Yutian also scored a goal. At this time, the audience shouted enthusiastically, and the sound shook the sky. After that, the two sides competed with each other, and the situation was still tense. The final whistle was blown, and Donghua won a resounding victory with a score of 5-2.</p>

<p>Top-grade Tong'an longan remains in short supply. Small and medium-sized sizes are weakening due to Guangyuan's encroachment.

<p>Aphorisms of Elder Ma Xiangbo at 93 Years Old</p>
<h3 id="e101">How Deeply Involved in Superstition and Cruelty Were We in the Past! <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Once, Old Mr. Xiang was on the veranda of the Leshan Hall, quietly observing the myriad forms of nature, finding contentment and pleasure in himself. Suddenly, he was moved, called me to his side, and said these words:</p>
<p>"I think, without a proper faith, one truly doesn't know to what extent superstition and cruelty can go. Let me tell you about things from the past. Ancient people only knew of a round heaven and a square earth. Emperors built carriages, making the top round and the bottom square: This was imitating heaven, truly superstitious. One must know to revere the 'Heaven that birthed the people', the 'Heaven that sent down the people', that is, the Creator; not that tangible, visible object, the blue expanse of the sky!</p>
<p>What is this about heavenly yang and earthly yin, the five elements mutually overcoming each other? During the Later Han dynasty, when people built houses, they would catch a passerby, kill him, and bury the corpse under the foundation of the new house! They said it was to suppress evil spirits. Wouldn't you say that's unjust? What is this about yang being superior and yin being inferior, harming women? All sorts of inhumane acts, such as the one praised in Tang dynasty novels, where a guest remarked that the host's maidservant was beautiful, and the host then ordered the maidservant to be steamed alive and the entire corpse brought to entertain the guest: How cruel is that act?</p>
<p>Han Changli is considered a literary giant, but when it comes to faith, he's outdated. He initially rejected Buddhism, but ended up being devoted to it, because he fundamentally didn't understand life, what happens before death, what happens after death: Therefore, he couldn't escape that fabricated cycle of reincarnation! The way Chinese people learn Buddhism is mostly caused by having no central guiding principle.</p>
<p>The Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties, with 'Heaven is principle, nature is principle', talking about it endlessly, they couldn't even clarify a single concept! For example, saying, 'If the ruler's heart is correct, then the country will be governed'. They don't know how many stages of governing a country there are between a ruler's heart being correct and the country being governed; that one word 'then', how easy is it? They valued empty talk and lacked substance. Even those who discussed Neo-Confucianism were so confused; it's even more unknowable about others!</p>
<p>When will we have a proper faith, so that we can eliminate all sorts of superstitions and cruelties (')"</p>

<p>— Xu Wanhua</p>
<p>丨A Word of Caution to Teahouse and Food Shop Owners丨</p>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, the fervent enthusiasm for eating mooncakes is once again returning to its former state, even in this Northeast region that cannot be recovered. As you pass through those mooncake-transformed streets: the fluttering mooncake shop signs and the colorful mooncake decorations will surely evoke a sweet and juicy sensation at the bottom of your tongue. However, mooncakes were originally called 'reunion cakes', and they are meant to symbolize the celebration of reunion: now that the country is shattered and homes are in danger, I wonder what thoughts arise in people's minds when they eat mooncakes? I believe it would be best to print cautionary slogans on the mooncakes, to awaken the general public from their deep slumber. I humbly suggest the following standards:</p>
<p>"Remembering national crisis and celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, which of the two is more important?"</p>
<p>"The Japanese are sucking the blood of the Northeast, yet you are indulging in eating mooncakes!"</p>
<p>"The loss of territory is like a mooncake with a corner already missing."</p>
<p>"Is this the time for you to be eating mooncakes?"</p>
<p>"May you save a few mooncake coins to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army."</p>
<p>"When you eat mooncakes, don't forget that the people of the Northeast are drinking the northwest wind!"</p>
<p>"You must first discuss recovering the Northeast before you can enjoy your mooncakes in peace."</p>
<p>"During this season of reunion, don't let our land remain broken for so long! But looking at the current mooncake trend, it seems to be a thing of the past: I wish in advance that next year, when we eat mooncakes, there won't be a second anniversary of the Northeast being lost, then these slogans of mine can also become obsolete."</p>
<h3 id="e103">Everyone's Mid-Autumn Festival <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>丨"The round moon shines on the nine provinces, some families rejoice, some families grieve: Some couples share a quilt, some wander homeless outside"!丨Nursery Rhyme丨</p>
<p>The volunteer soldiers in the three northeastern provinces have been fighting bloody battles against the enemy for a year, advancing wave upon wave. They have repeatedly attacked Shenyang, but ultimately withdrew due to lack of ammunition. Now, the volunteer soldiers have declared that they will attack Shenyang on the Mid-Autumn Festival to eat mooncakes. They are determined to save our dying Chinese nation with black iron, and they want to wash away our past shame with red blood. The Mid-Autumn Festival for the volunteer soldiers in the three northeastern provinces will surely be spent amidst the roar of cannons and the earth-shattering cries of battle.</p>
<p>The youth within the Pass who are still able to live in relative peace, seeing the bright moon in the sky and the earth like silver on Mid-Autumn Festival, truly think it is a time to enjoy themselves. Some secretly arrange to go out and enjoy the moon with their lovers, seeking hidden pleasures, joyfully awaiting the arrival of Mid-Autumn Festival to revel in the joys of life, focusing only on the smiles and tears of their lovers, and ignoring the safety of the country. The Mid-Autumn Festival for these lovers will be spent amidst such enchanting scenery.</p>
<p>The rich people, upon encountering the Mid-Autumn Festival, think that "How many times in life do we see the moon overhead?", how can they miss it? They are busy inviting relatives and friends to open a feast under the moon on Mid-Autumn Festival night, truly enjoying the moon. In the eyes of the rich, the Mid-Autumn Festival is naturally a delightful affair.</p>
<p>The poor people, due to the arrival of the Mid-Autumn Festival, are besieged by creditors demanding repayment everywhere, relentlessly pressing for it, and unable to cope. Not only do they not get to taste any mooncakes or ginkgo nuts, but they only see more of the world's fickleness and coldness! In the eyes of the poor, the Mid-Autumn Festival is naturally a dead end.</p>
<p>Every Mid-Autumn Festival, the farmers all look delighted because there is always a considerable harvest in the fields. The farmers get a share of harvest for their labor, a glass of wheat wine, and happily spend the farmers' Mid-Autumn Festival on the banks of the fields.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the economic depression, industry and commerce have declined sharply, factories have closed one after another, and most of the workers have lost their jobs. Now the Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived again, and I don't know how many more shops and factories will close down? Society will have another batch of unemployed people who are in distress and have no one to turn to. What a terrible impression the Mid-Autumn Festival is on these people whose jobs are precarious?</p>
<p>Lamenting to General Jiang and General Cai, Pillars of Respect, in Light of the Emergency in Rehe</p>
<p>Another report of emergency in Rehe. I truly cannot bear to speak of it. Who will resist for a long time? For years, the country has lost its defensive barriers. Like beans and stalks, we are brothers. But slaves will become descendants. When will we call on Jiang and Cai? To rekindle the national spirit.</p>
<p>Glad to Hear of Progress by the Volunteer Army in the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>The invaders have been here for another year. My eyes are filled with wounds, weeping tears. The quail's head (eastern territory) was given to Qin, yet they are drunk. At the wine table, I am still sober while grieving for Ying. From now on, how can there be a hidden sky? Who will execute the righteous with a white horse? Happily, the patriots of Guandong (Manchuria) are listening, fighting to kill the enemy and avenge the times.</p>

<p>丨Jesus Conquers the Devil?丨</p>
<p>I am a non-religious person. This Sunday, I accepted an invitation from a colleague at school to go to the Jesus Church next door for worship. The pastor stood and preached the Bible. After preaching the Bible, they sang hymns. After doing this devoutly, they followed it with silent prayer: After doing it several times in the same way, a sound of 'Amen' signaled the end of the service. Just at this moment, earth-shattering noises erupted outside the door.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go in. If I go in, I will have no place to stay. I can't get through this door no matter what..."</p>
<p>Several of the younger people who were worshiping rushed outside to see what was happening. They realized that the one shouting was a young woman, but she was extremely frantic. Next to her were several female church members, holding her back. She simply refused to go in. Fortunately, Pastor Zhao came up with a wonderful idea. He took out a Bible and told her to look at it. She said:</p>
<p>"Two roads... it's so difficult for me! ... It's so difficult for me!" She finally said this and was guided into the Jesus Church by the Bible.</p>
<p>The onlookers and church members crowded around her. As for her, she was baring her fangs and claws, as if resenting being forced to come in. Her eyes were wide open, like a pair of copper bells, and she looked terrified!</p>
<p>The two female church members who accompanied her briefly described her situation to the audience:</p>
<p>"She is from Shaoxing. Because she couldn't bear the abuse of her grandmother-in-law, she hanged herself when she really couldn't take it anymore. When her grandmother-in-law saw her handling her final affairs, she also imitated her. However, they were rescued by the people living with them. Her husband, because he was unemployed at home, saw the unsettling situation and actually hanged himself. Later, her grandmother-in-law remarried her. Now her former husband has been looking for her for several months. We think that Jesus can conquer everything, so we asked her to come to worship. If she believes in the church, her former husband will probably not come looking for her again!"</p>
<p>After she attended the service once, she regained her original kind state. The location of the Jesus Church is Wuzhen, Zhejiang.</p>

<p>(8)</p>
<p>Fenruo felt such great joy and gratitude that a huge flower of laughter bloomed in her heart, but she couldn't stop the tears from flowing like a mineral spring. Her ancient well of over ten years was dry and silent, devoid of life. She never imagined that this elementary school teacher who sat guarding the green carpet would transform into a valiant warrior, and moreover, a hero fighting the enemy for the country; she even less imagined that he would find her again, pleading with her; she even suspected whether he had really abandoned his wife, whether he had not yet married a new, graceful and wealthy wife, whether he really wanted to take an old widow back? She didn't know how she should allow him or reject him. She repeatedly deliberated, thinking for the sake of his future happiness, reputation, and career, that she should definitely not allow him to go with him, and that she should sacrifice herself no matter what. She lay on the table, sobbing unrestrainedly and grievingly.</p>
<p>"Fen, don't cry! I can tell you some sincere words. The grand welcome ceremony cannot move my heart; I only beg you in sorrow to give me some joy, to let my heart, which has longed for and wandered aimlessly for over ten years, find a settlement, to let my immensely passionate emotions, and the wings of my heart, which have been barely covering them, have a chance to cover my heart again! Ah! My good Fenruo! I know your previous ideals and admirations, so I escaped to join the army, and now I have achieved my goal; moreover, your husband has been dead for over ten years, your family is also gone, your beautiful emotions are still the same as before, please have pity on me, comfort me, so that I can complete the unfinished career, settle the unsettled heart, have pity on me." When Regiment Commander Yuan spoke, he had no military accent, but was as gentle as a lamb, and he was indeed using sincerity to touch Fenruo's heart.</p>
<p>"Really? Really?" Fenruo, listening as if hypnotized, really stopped crying, raised her face, looked at Regiment Commander Yuan, feeling very excited and happy, "But, what method will I use to prove that your words are completely reasonable? What method will I use to test whether society's non-opposition to your actions is correct? If I do as you say, how will I analyze my own actions, so that they are not mistaken?"</p>
<p>"Fenruo, my good girl!" Regiment Commander Yuan became even more impassioned and excited.</p>
<p>"Eh! Where am I still a good girl?" Fenruo was a little surprised, suspecting that he dared to deliberately tease her.</p>
<p>"This is my subjective view, my intuition, I truly still regard you as a good girl, and moreover, as a supreme celestial being,"</p>
<p>I beg you, please trust that my words are completely reasonable, and completely correct; if you allow it, then your actions will not be wrong at all, your thoughts will be completely accurate."</p>
<p>"But you are too unfair to your former wife."</p>
<p>"There's no way around it; moreover, her whereabouts are now unknown."</p>
<p>"What if you meet her again in the future? How will you deal with it? This is closely related to your reputation and career, you should consider it carefully."</p>

<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>In this era of flourishing science, without real knowledge, one cannot create any great cause. In other words, a great cause cannot be created by someone without knowledge.</p>
<p>Looking at the great inventors of the past and present, which one did not have real knowledge, which one did not have decades of real research? It can be said that none of them succeeded by chance.</p>
<p>In ancient times, when two generals faced each other in battle, if one of them was defeated, then he would take out his final, best skill, chanting incantations, wanting to borrow the magic weapon of his ancestor or master. But in the end, he could never defeat the enemy. Similarly, in today's ball games, if one is unwilling to practice diligently beforehand, but hopes that the best player on the enemy team will suddenly get injured and be taken to the hospital during the game, I believe that this kind of thinking is the decline of personality and the decay of thought.</p>
<p>There are also some people who worry that they cannot afford a high-level education because they don't have money. I say, that doesn't matter. Even like our country's Mencius, and the West's Edison, which of them had money in their youth? I can even say that most great inventors don't have money. As long as we work hard and practice diligently, the problem of not having money simply cannot be established.</p>
<p>No, I want to say, "The strength of the country must have real knowledge. Good luck cannot lead to success."</p>

<h3 id="e108">Petroleum <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Liang</p>
<p>Petroleum, known as PETROLEUM in the West, is a liquid fuel, which is much better than solid fuels such as coal, because it is not only easy to ignite, but also has no residue. When burning, just inject it into the oil storage area, and use a pipe to lead it to the flame outlet, then you can continue to ignite it without any effort. From this point of view, petroleum is indeed a very good fuel! Although all countries in the world produce oil, the United States and Russia produce the most. Although my country's Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Sichuan produce petroleum, there is no large-scale exploitation, which is not enough for domestic application, so that foreign oil is sold in our country. According to the latest survey, about 101,522,842 barrels are used each year. If this huge drain is not remedied, it is a pity!</p>
<p>There are two methods of extraction: manual and mechanical. When using the manual method, manpower is used to dig deep wells in various parts of the coalfield. When the location of the petroleum is reached, a pump is used to suck it out, store it in a large tank, and send it to the refinery. When using the mechanical method, a high frame is first erected on the oil field, with an iron pulley connected to a lever and an iron cone iron rod. Then, the force of the machine is used to drive the lever, causing the iron cone to lift up and fall, drilling the oil field into a deep well, and then the oil can be extracted.</p>
<p>Petroleum is a brownish liquid, which is formed by ancient animals and plants undergoing crustal movement, buried in the soil underground, subjected to great pressure from above, and without air circulation, and decomposed by bacteria for a long time. If it is placed in an iron steamer and heated with fire, when the heat reaches 150 degrees Celsius, the gas that is steamed out will turn into gasoline when it encounters cold. When heated to 300 degrees Celsius, the gas that is steamed out will turn into kerosene when it encounters cold. When heated to 360 degrees Celsius, the gas that is steamed out will turn into heavy oil when it encounters cold.</p>
<p>Gasoline (VOLATILE OIL) is a colorless and transparent liquid, its properties are very soft, and its ignition temperature is very low, so it cannot be used for lighting. But it can remove oil stains from clothes and utensils and be used as fuel in machinery.</p>
<p>Kerosene (KERASENE) is a yellow liquid, its calorific value is very high, and it is easy to burn. If it is sealed in a cylinder, it will not change or rot, and there is no risk of self-ignition, because of these advantages, it is used for lighting and for repelling pests.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Heavy Oil (HEAVY OIL) is a pale yellow, pasty liquid that is difficult to ignite. Machine oil (MECHANIC OIL) and paraffin (PARAFFIN) can be extracted from this oil. Machine oil is a viscous liquid. If it is applied to the axles of machines, it can reduce friction and can also be used as fuel for cars and warships. Paraffin is a white crystalline solid that melts when heated and is also very easy to burn. It can be used to make candles and wax paper.</p>
<p>Gasoline and heavy oil cannot be used for lighting. Why can kerosene be used for lighting? This is because gasoline ignites too quickly, which is very dangerous. Heavy oil ignites too slowly, which is less dangerous but difficult to ignite, so gasoline and heavy oil cannot be used for lighting. As for kerosene, the ignition is moderately fast, it is easy to ignite, the danger is less, and it can be completely burned, so kerosene can be used for lighting.</p>
<p>How can gasoline remove dirt? This is because it can dissolve oily substances, causing it to gradually evaporate, so oil stains on clothes and utensils can be removed with gasoline.</p>

<p>In our country, where biology is backward, education is bankrupt, and everything lags behind others, it is natural to imitate the things of other advanced countries. But even though we imitate, we should not blindly follow, but should choose the good and follow it, and change the bad.</p>
<p>The motivation for drafting this article is that I saw Mr. Fo's article "A Bill for Children's Studies" in yesterday's "Tan Yan" column of this journal and was moved to write it. However, I am only taking the issue of weekly holidays out separately for everyone to discuss, so it can be said that this proposal of mine is a proposal, or it can be said to be a supplement to Mr. Fo's opinion. However, Mr. Fo's article was not published in this association.</p>
<p>The school's weekly holiday, in the final analysis, has a bit of a certain religious color. European customs are brought along with it. Our authorities do not investigate its advantages and disadvantages and rashly imitate it until now. I really don't know what it means to leave this kind of inferior trail here at a time when it is clear that a certain religion is a tool for imperialist cultural aggression and anesthetic thought, and when the call to overthrow it is being sung loudly. As for saying that it is because of six days of diligent study and that one day of holiday is used to compensate for the loss of mental energy, it is close to sporadic efforts and as contradictory. (A person's mental energy is valued for daily exercise and daily rest.) Because people use their mental energy for seven or eight hours every day, one or two hours of exercise, or one or two hours of leisurely gazing and walking, is enough to restore the depleted mental energy, and there is plenty of time to spare. Why create the evils of movie theaters and dance halls with this one day of time and waste useful learning? Our country has reached a time when studying is necessary to save the country, and science is necessary to save the country. I think everyone agrees with my words, so I solemnly put forward this case for detailed discussion. There are also places that have the same meaning as Mr. Fo, so I will not repeat them.</p>

<p>Mr. Rui Yucheng, I read your masterpiece (Fabric Printing Method) in the supplement of the Shen Bao on the ninth of this month. I know that you have a lot of research in science. Now I have the following things to ask you to teach.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of pigments on the market, some of which can be dissolved in water and dyed, such as direct, salt-based, and acidic pigments. I tried to print them on cotton fabrics and saw that the colors were very bright and lovely, but unfortunately they fade.</p>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to science, but I need a lot of this kind of pigment every year. Now I want to print it on cotton fabrics to make the colors not fade. Alas, sir, I have spent several months of effort researching this color, but the result is always that it cannot reach a durable and non-fading state. This is a big drawback in my experience, and I don't have any suitable friends to guide me at the moment. Reading your masterpiece, I know that you are also very proficient in dyeing. I hope you can give me a reply in the supplement, that is my greatest gratitude.</p>
<p>My address is in Sheng Maolong Dyehouse, Nanshi, Datuan Town, Pudong. Please answer my request no matter what. You know that I am now looking forward to your good news. Wishing you progress, Sheng Sanmin, 9, 11.</p>

<p>Xiaodongmen Xie Da Xiang Promotes Domestically Produced Silk and Satin Xiaodongmen Xie Da Xiang Silk Fabric Store has long been recognized by society for its exquisite goods and low prices. Recently, in order to thoroughly resist inferior goods, all goods displayed in the store are marked with their country of origin to facilitate customer purchases. It is also actively promoting domestic goods and has set up a silk and satin department to vigorously promote them. There are daily sales of discounted goods, so customers are extremely crowded, it is said.</p>
<p>The Rise of Domestically Produced Socks and Garters Socks and garters, although a small item of clothing, have a very wide consumption. Chinese people neglect it because it is small, so inferior goods are everywhere in the market. According to the customs report, last year it was worth hundreds of millions of yuan, and the rights and interests flowed out, which is a pity to see. Since September 18th, Chinese people have finally awakened from a dream and paid a little attention to this. At that time, the first to create the Asia America Socks and Garters Company was Mr. Wen, a well-known figure in the Shanghai business community, who set up a manufacturing factory with a certain scale and gradually improved it. Now it has been completed. The quality of its fineness and the beauty of its style are really above the inferior goods and are on par with the famous American Paris suspenders. It is truly a highlight of domestic goods. The sales points are Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, Lihua, China, and major stores. The general manager's office is Nanyang Socks Factory on Nanjing Road, Shanghai.</p>
