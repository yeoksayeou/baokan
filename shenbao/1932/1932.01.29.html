<p>結束中日案討論</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會現從事於覓一方案、以應付中日間在滿洲上海兩處新發展之工作、今日午後四時開秘密會議、五時一刻休會、俾此工作即可進行無阻、英法西班牙與挪威四國代表之小股委員會現從事草擬宣言書、以維持國聯會章之原則、宣言書將詳言滿洲門户開放政策之重要、而對於上海地位、尤有特殊之聲叙聞行政會各會員現皆以爲滿洲談判未可無期拖延如上月巴黎之所爲、故擬努力覓取在各方面可視爲滿意之方案、起草委員會今晚集議兩小時、雖尚未能完成宣言之全文、但主要點業己議定、此文現巳有三頁之多、想其他行政會會員八人定可予以同意、惟不欲提交中日代表請其贊同、故此文未有任何法律上價値、此文俟行政會各會員除中日兩國會員外通過後、即由議長彭古在公開會議時宣讀、衆料此文宣讀後、行政會即將閉會、宣言文内容、非至明日不能發表、因明日將開全體大會也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日午後四時國聯理事會舉行秘密會議、中日代表均未出席、七時散會、對於中日爭案並未决定第二步之行動、星期四晨十時三十分將舉行公開會議、辦理議程上之事務、聞調查委員會巳定二月三日由法國哈佛起程赴美、將過加拿大、然後乘船赴横濱、赴滿之前、尚將至南京一行、理事會己决議對於遼案問題、力避再作新决議案、現已命起草委員會草一宣言、由理事會會長彭古宣讀、以表示理事會之意見、中國總代表顏惠慶博士日本總代表佐藤均須依守之、而不作正式之投票、日内瓦中人方面現主張理事會應將提會之各案、在二月二日軍縮會議開會之前完全淸理之、俾免牽擾軍縮會議、於是理事會須待調查委員團報告之至云、目下理事會之組織份子、雖暫覺荏弱、但會中之人切言如日本陸軍或海軍佔據上海、則國聯必取迅速最有力之行動以對付之、且軍縮會議方在日内瓦開會、理事會可以隨時召集、而以全屬外長出席、並可以參與軍縮會議之代表召集國聯特别評論會、祇須電請政府授以證書而己、理事會辦理遼案之行動、殊見荏弱、故國聯各界尤其爲小國之代表嘖有煩言、而主張將中日全案提交國聯評議會公决、理事會因有會員數人反對理事會、對於一月八日美國務卿史汀生以同樣照會致中日兩國之舉表示同情、故今日開會討論（中日代表未出席）可否建議令日本在公開會議中正式宣布遵守滿洲門户開放政策、如日本覆史氏之文所述者、按史氏照會中要求維持門户開放政策、并聲明美國不承認日本在華造成之任何事實爲合法、今日午後理事之辯論、即以此爲焦點、英代表薛西爾主張在彭古會長之宣言書中、援引史汀生照會中之語、則即等於贊同美國之照會云、（二十七日國民社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）今日國聯理事會舉行公開會議、討論經濟委員會之報告時、中國代表請注意滿洲事變及於世界經濟衰落之反響、因遼案所釀成不靖之時局、使人心恐慌、中國重要市塲爲之封閉、遂令全世界受其影響、故此種局勢、急需救濟云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>美國向英徵求意見</p>
<p>英决不取一致行動</p>
<p>紐約美國現正待英國答覆其英美應取共同立塲以拒日本對華「侵略」之建議、據華盛頓各特别訪員聲稱、就現象觀之、美政府現將取一種切實行動、蓋政府各要員現均以不掩飾之莊嚴狀態、研究上海凶險之發展也、非官塲方面曾提出兩種可能的行動、（一）英美兩國對日施經濟壓力、此舉包含禁止日貨之交易、（二）英美海軍在中國水面協同示威、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美聯社今日探悉、美國務卿史汀生最近與駐美英國大使林德賽談話時、曾非正式建議英國協同美國施行對日之經濟抵制、藉以遏止日本對華之侵迫政策、英國對此建議尚無表示、因以美國在知英國政策之前將不作切實决議、聞胡佛總統之顧問數人現信此時由白宫發一關於上海日本海軍可能的行動之嚴厲警告、必有效果、但亦有人信日本早知美國之態度、無庸再申述美國之立塲者、胡佛總統之内閣現巳嚴重考慮警告日本勿在滬施行暴舉、藉以挽回東方事變之可能性、此間政界對於此節、并未否認、聞國務院與英大使署巳非正式討論兩國合作保護上海英美僑民事、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務卿史汀生己與各要員商榷滿洲與上海時局、但美國擬採何種步驟、尚無表示、今晨史汀生與英意兩國大使討論此問題、復與國務院遠東司司長晤商良久、内容皆未發表、但若干官員預料美國對於中日爭端中之最近發展、或將採行甚切實之行動、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦英國對於此次上海之事變、已决定採取積極主張、保護在中國居住之僑民、但據政府中人稱、英政府恐未必能加入對日經濟抵制之共同行爲、美國對於日軍之行動、或得加以警告或與以唾駡、但英國則覺苟日本能鄭重聲明態度、或即可認爲滿意、美國國務卿史汀生向英國駐美大使之林德賽所提出之英美採取共同經濟抵制之策略、巳經英國政府之精密考慮、但英外部向未能採取何種决策、恐美政府之建議、尚未届所得英政府同意之時期也、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此處政府中人聞英國巳决定不與美政府採取致行動、以經濟封鎖對付日本、故國務院中人員現正辦論對於日本究竟採取何種應付之方策、多數人信美國對於日本在上海之行動、將向東京政府提出和緩之警告、陳述該事件之足以危害世界和平、而在他、方面則覺此種警告、絶不能發生任何效果、因日本在過去之時期中、己受同樣之一切警告、置諸不理、再華府負責方面人稱、倘美國欲採取經濟封鎖政策、禁止向日輸出、以及不准日貨之入口事、先必須獲得國會之通過、現國務卿史汀生對於此次上海之事變、以及一般中日爭端之態度、尚在深加考慮之中、諒不久必有所表示也、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英美現正在會商美國之建議、今日除此公布外、政界方面無詳情可探、羣衆對於上海地位之憂慮、傳播漸廣、各報皆以大字登載上海布防之最近詳情、惟評論者甚少、星報謂日本富於解釋、富於哀的美敦書、茲復與世界公論爲抗矣、又謂英美依甚密切諒解方針以相團結、實爲於破中求全之道云、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>自上海事件發生以來。我當局處處隱忍。甚至全部接受日人之要求。其所以忍辱而爲此屈服之舉者。非僅爲維護上海全埠治安計亦恐軍事一旦發動。將蔓延而不可收拾也。然而我當局含垢忍痛之結果。而仍不能滿日人之意。必欲一發以爲快。爲何等可痛。之事耶。</p>
<p>惟軍事旣發動之後。發展將至如何程度。犧牲將至如何程度。無論何人。不能逆料。所不能不爲世界聲明者。我國人民。向爲愛和平之人民。自九一八東北事件發生以來。絶未取抵抗態度。一方尊重國聯之勸告。而聽國聯之處置。乃國聯三次勸告日本。而日本始終置之不理。我國人民。雖甚憤激而仍恪守和平。今者上海事起。我國人民。亦甚激昻。惟以上海爲經濟商業之重心。故雖在國聯開會之時間我在國聯仍未提出强硬之要求。而在滬一方面。且不惜含淚以接受日人之條件。我人自謂保守和平。亦可謂至矣盡矣。今者美國華盛頓政府方以關懐滬局。謀所以遏制事件擴大之方法。國聯方面。亦正殷切注意滬局。謀所以維持滬局之和平。而不謂日方迫我接受其條件之後。仍作軍事之發動旣不稍念中日之友誼。復不瞻顧國聯與美之關懐注意。悍然施展暴力我國至此。萬難再忍。自不能不起而作正當之防衛。今後國聯與美究竟將如何處置此事。如何遏止軍事之擴大。如何伸張公理與維持和平。吾人均所不欲問吾人惟盼國聯注意此事件之眞相。辨别此事件之是非而已。</p>

<p>我軍正當防衛</p>
<p>雙方發生衝突</p>
<p>市府通告各領</p>
<p>并向日領抗議</p>
<p>華租兩界當局</p>
<p>昨均宣告戒嚴</p>
<p>昨日入晚後、外人方面即有嚴重消息傳出、於當晚十二時、日本陸戰隊進攻閘北、初於十一時十分時、日本陸戰隊即有一小隊數十人、由北四川路底司令部開到天通庵、首先佔據天通庵車站、該站人員即時離去、但斯時駐防閘北之我十九路軍、尚靜守防綫、並不射擊、及至十二時許、日陸戰隊即以天通庵車站爲根據地、分數隊突向我軍防綫攻擊、我駐防軍以釁自彼開、不能不與抵抗、當即奮起應戰、如是各方力謀緩和之上海、頓時變爲戰爭狀態矣、茲將本報記者實地調查之戰况、分誌如下、</p>
<p>天通菴站昨晚十一時十分、日陸戰隊一小隊約數十人、均携手提機關槍、乘機器脚踏車、臂緾白布、由便衣日人領入天通菴車站、時車站人員均避鋒離去、我軍多散伏各處、靜守防線、極爲鎭靜、</p>
<p>閘北巷戰昨晚十一時餘、日陸戰隊在天通庵方面、首先向我十九路防軍開放步槍數響、隨即分淞滬鐵路及虬江路兩方面向我軍防綫衝鋒、我軍兵士憤激萬分、勇氣百倍、遂用機關槍射擊、日軍連衝數次、均被我軍擊退、此後雙方遂用步槍抵抗、直至十二時五十分時、日軍又由後方補充生力軍向我軍猛攻、我軍死力還擊、互戰至一時二十分、日軍仍不得逞、退回天通庵以東、當雙方激戰時、機關槍聲不絶於耳、並據外人方面探悉、日軍衝鋒時、損失甚鉅、自一時半以後、槍聲稍稀、並逐漸向天通庵方面以東移去、想係日軍後退之故、但至一時五十分時、機關槍聲又起、且甚稠密、在淞滬車站之屋頂、可見子彈火光、激戰至二點半、槍聲尚未停止、同時寳山路口方面、亦起槍聲十餘響、又北站方面、亦有槍聲十餘響、而站内之電燈、亦立刻熄滅、此時槍聲最密之地、似在虬江路與淞滬車站之間、惟當記者於今晨二時四十分離開北站附近時、槍聲又較稀少、</p>
<p>江灣接觸日軍在天通庵車站挑釁後、同時江灣方面、日陸戰隊亦與我軍第七十八師第六團接觸、初僅步哨衝突、我軍爲正當防衛起見、即積極應戰、日軍連次衝鋒、均爲我軍擊退、我軍士氣旺盛、無不以一當十、接戰至本報上版時止、日軍卒無所逞、</p>
<p>陣線未動本報最后消息、截至今晨四時止、我軍奮勇應戰結果、陣線毫未移動、我軍奪獲日鐵甲車三輛、炸燬一輛、雙方均有死傷、</p>
<p>忽起大火今晨二時四十分、正在兩方激戰之際、在老靶子路福生路以北、天通菴車站以南、忽起大火、一時火光燭天、形勢浩大、因該處適在火線區域、故燒至三時五十分、大火尚未熄滅、</p>
<p>轟擊吳淞昨晚十時許、日艦十三艘駛進三夾水、向吳淞砲台轟擊、發砲三四十發、我軍初先積極應戰、其後忽寂然無聞、日艦以爲砲台己燬、即擬登陸佔領間、我砲台突又開砲、日艦稍退、其後上海吳淞間之消息忽斷、吳淞戰况待訪、</p>
<p>司令部息據淞滬警備司令部傳出消息、謂昨晚駐滬日海軍司令、忽致一緊急通牒、與華當局、限令夜間、將閘北華軍撤退相當地點時、我國當局正開會協議辦法、詎同時閘北虬江路一帶、日陸戰隊、巳與華兵發生衝突、頓時槍聲大作、至今晨十二時十分、閘北電話、完全隔絶、電話局人員、均逃避一空、即直接通閘北之華洋電話、亦一律遮斷、</p>
<p>飛機突起今晨四時卅分、突有飛機一架、由東向北轉向西南各處、空中偵察、至四時三刻、又轉向浦東方面飛翔、復在租界空中來往視探、直至本報付印時、仍翺翔天空、</p>

過於悲觀。似乎不該在你這憂傷袞痛的時候。再來增添你的煩苦。然而我是巴望得你太專太切。才會有這些過慮的呀。安玉田道。你說的本都是好話。我很願意聽的。但我不願見你太爲我的事傷心。說過了就算完。大家都不要再難過了罷。你若想多坐一會。我們不妨另談點别的。若談久了覺得有些餓。可以呌點點心來吃。再不然。我且先斟一盃熱茶與你喝罷。哎···眞是的。你來了這半天。只顧說話去了。我連一杯茶都忘記未曾替你舀呢。說罷。立起身來就去呌茶房冲開水。李問霞還坐在椅子上。在　　　縤的掏出一方小手帕。拭去臉上的啼　。忽然覺拭得不甚乾凈。一眼見門邊洗臉盆架上嵌有一方鏡子。便走過去想對鏡再揩拭一番。不料剛一照鏡。忽發見了還有一盆香噴噴地用過不久的洗臉水。心中正自驚訝。旋又見臉盆邊木板上還放着個精巧的小金盒兒。正打開着露出個粉紅色的小粉撲。又擱着一條金棍　的胭脂。順手拾起來細細一　這明明是摩登女性們隨身携帶的化妝用具。不禁腹疑團。忍不住要查問過淸楚。就舉起那明亮亮地的金盒兒。找着了安玉田。向他眼面前晃了晃道。這是什麽。一言甫畢。伊的臉色便沉住了很不大好看。安玉田也是大吃一驚。幾乎嚇跑了三魂七魄。欲知後事如何。且看下回分解。</p>

<p>中華民國二十一年一月二十九日星期五（不另取資）小論壇挨打以後幸　　昨天我無端的被人飽打了一餐。實在的，那傢伙是太兇，我自揣我是「打」不過他，便决定咬緊牙關「挨」幾下，我鎭靜，我忍耐，因爲我知道「君子動口，小人動手」，而且「打脫牙齒和血呑」，又是我們大國民所推崇欽服的「好漢」行爲，我縱然「挨」幾下，但仍不失爲「君子」，仍不失爲「好漢」，我便以十二分和善而婉轉的態度對他說··　　「朋友，注意公理喲，你打我是公理所不容的哩！」　　然而他並不怕公理，這和善而婉轉的陳辭是絲毫無效，而且他更惡狠狠地指着我說··　　「不准開口！再開口！便要你的命！」爲着要保全我底命，於是我便不開口。因爲我知道「好漢不吃眼前虧」，而且「識時務者爲俊傑」，不開口至少還可算是「識時務」。　　然而打在身上究竟有點痛，那傢伙己經命令不准我開口，當然是不能「哼」。於是我只效法我們的前輩阿先生悶在心頭想，我想··　　「只算是ＸＸ打老子罷」！　　可是連「想」我也還是不敢十分放肆，因爲我生怕那傢伙知道。　　我預料，總有一天，我連「想」也不能。大衆文藝橡皮輪子絲　　橡皮輪子轉不停，黄包車夫汗淋淋，劈面北風多寒意，車上坐客發慈心。車夫車夫你慢跑，莫待停下把病招，薄薄衣衫濕透了，不是傷寒便喘哮。橡皮輪子緩緩轉，車夫拉手抹把汗，一聲咳嗽一口痰，吐了一會先生喚。况且昨天生意少，車租還去錢完了，一家大小五個人，人人肚裏没有飽。今天拚命拉生意，想望多掙幾個子，餓死就在眼面前，那管病死不病死！橡皮輪子停下來，換得銅圓十五枚；坐客没走三步遠，又見車夫飛步開。身上衣服本來單，要不急跑怎耐寒？停下原知冰徹骨，生意多時便不關。大衆科學電燈自動開閉庶民·　　讀大衆科學欄電燈泡的製造，惹動了我在旅行中所見自動開閉電燈的回憶，事情是這樣的··　　一次我去參觀柏林電氣托納斯的陳列所，所中有一間宣傳代裝電燈廣告的樣子間，内裝無數各種各式各色新式廣告電燈，可是那些燈；如無人進前參觀時，都不放光的，一旦有人進前參觀，樣子間裏，立刻異光齊發，照得觀者不辨紅黄藍白，如觀者移步他去，那些燈立刻熄滅，　　好奇的我，必欲知其究竟，探尋的結果，纔發現樣子間外，從觀者背後有一線微細的電光，直射入樣子間内一小鐵筒中，觀者進樣子間前注視時，這一線微光就被阻而不能射入樣子間内的筒中，樣子間内的燈就立刻燃點起來，反之，就一齊熄滅，如用手阻由外射入樣子間的那線微光，亦得同樣結果，　　我才明白，這不是有人暗中主使，或神妙的機械作用，乃是一種化學原質的應用，化學中有一種原質名呌Ｓｅｌｅｕ符號是Ｓｅ中文譯作硒，他的原子量是七九，二，是一八一七年爲Ｂｅｒｚｅｌｉｕｓ從製造硫酸的鋁室内所發現，　　硒與硫黄同族，但他有一種金屬的變態與硫黄異，硒在金屬變態時，在暗室中，幾乎是不導電體·但一見微薄的光，他就立刻變成電的傳導體了·如用金屬變態的硒，聯於陰陽電導線中間，則導線上的電流能通與否，就視聯於導線間的硒當時見光與否而定·如再利用硒感光通電的作用感成電磁，再利用這磁性的引力，就可斷續另一電流而開閉電燈　　樣子裏的小筒内，就有利用硒的感光導電性裝成的機關，隨有光自外射與否而自動，開閉樣子間内的電燈了，　　有許多大公司大銀行，特别是地窖或銀庫裏，也有利用一　來裝成的警號，盜如黑夜偷入，只須燃一枝火柴吹香烟時，警號就立刻自動報告捕房了·　　此外紐約或倫敦，昨天出了一件驚人的事，今天上海報館就可將那件事的照片登載出來，又德人最近發明，在柏林可也看見紐約或東京的風景等等·都是一　的感光導電作用。不過理論與構造複雜一點，在此地說不明罷了·街頭社會學他們的天父濤哥　　一天兩餐一個月袁頭九尊的包飯吃完了後，看看時光尚早，要睡不但睡不得，還怕惹出一塲的毛病，在這方丈似的亭子間裏呆坐，又太没趣。於是，便加上了由吳淞路富舖裏買來的舊大衣，戴上了經時間這自然力而由淡灰色染成黑鼠色的舊帽子，再套上了毛殆己脫盡的古手套，走出後門，沿着不夜街的北四川路慢慢地跑下。踏過横浜橋未久，正意識矇矓地步着之間，忽然覺着一個不相識的時　密司、站在我的面前。眞是受寵若驚，我好像木雞般地呆立，不知所以　　「先生，請進去聽道理吧！早一天聽道，天國就早近一天！」　　這是朦朧中耳朶所告訴我的。及至腦筋淸晰些，我己經跨進一家敎會的中門了。「宗敎是鴉片；尤其基督敎是帝國主義侵略中國的工具！難道跑進去受他們打個嗎啡麻醉針不行！」昨天所讀的社會科學這樣地提醒我。好在這家「舶來燕子窩」的構造我很熟識，正門過去，還有個邊門。不消說，我是馬上由了邊門溜出來的。回首一看，又是個西裝革履的翩翩少年，好像小羊的被驅進屠屋似地，給了剛才那個密司請進去。我不覺在嘴裏念說··　　「他們的天父，你們的上帝，願你賜赦我這個不願中毒的可憐人！亞門」一脚！　　　是一天下午，跑馬塲裏賽馬的時節。一陣陣的中西男女，趕乘着汽車，風馳電掣而來參加，眞是車水馬龍，極一時之盛了，有些小販也趁此熱鬧，來到塲外，多做一點小生意。我適於此時經過靜安寺路，見有一個十三四歲的孩子，把他貯花生米的攤籃擺在路旁地上，稍微整理一下籃裏所賣得的錢。他的眼光很快，瞥見一山長大漢的西捕，履聲「槖槖」地來了，他馬上携着花生籃子就跑。那西捕兇狠狠地趕到「槖！」的一脚踢起，只見那孩子花生籃裏的花生米和錢抛出了大半，撒珠似地撒在地上，那孩子經此一踢，没命地向西奔跑！跑！跑！····跑得看不見了。　　喂！這是阻礙交通啊！　　呵！原來如此。上海的馬路是坐汽車的人的，連馬路旁邊都是坐汽車的人的！東南西北强奸白　　每天報紙上成篇連頁的記載着··强奸幼女，拖入工房，下部受傷，處女膜破裂，某某旅館好宿幾宵，姦拐捲逃··········眞是書不勝書。我想報紙的編者也會感到厭煩吧！這個社會裏的罪惡事情，實在太多了！强而姦者，或男强女，或女强男，都應該有罪。其罪之大，罰他進幾天或幾個月的牢獄，白吃幾天麵包，我想還不足以示儆戒，因爲他出了獄，一旦性慾發作，仍然會幹出這强而姦的勾當來。那末，怎麽重辦呢？　　聽說火魯魯奴島有一位土人强姦一位白種少女，這位少年正當二九年華。後來對簿公庭，法官因無證據，便宣判無罪。但事後，白人憤怒，便把這位少年殺死了。從這次事件以後，白人便在島上訂出土人犯姦者處死刑的法律來，以儆戒土人。以犯姦而處死刑，這種刑罰總算嚴重了吧！可是有無成效，我們故不得而知。中國的土匪，捉住了，格殺勿論，割頭示衆，其刑罰故無以復加矣，但土匪仍然如毛。眞是殺不盡！殺不盡！　　「食色性也，」要解决，非從這里解决不可，如果個個土匪都成了富翁，個個色情狂的强奸者都有了眷屬，我想此風總會絶滅了吧！茶房之女雯卿　　男女同學制度實行後，學校裏平添了多少風流韵事·「茶房之女」是韵事中之别開生面者，今且寫在下邊，到也很有趣味。　　學校裏的雜事很多，茶房又太少了··幾個校役，總是忙得不亦樂乎！老王除了招呼幾個寢室裏的茶水以外，還要掃走廊，掃敎室。他因爲時間來不及，就要他的女兒小毛帮忙送茶水到寢室裏去。不知什麽時候起，小毛便被一位大學生賞識了。她雖然没有那些很嬌傲的摩登小姐修飾得漂亮。可是，她那黑而圓的臉蛋，札紅線的短髮辮，藍大布的短衣長褲··這檢樸的裝朿，確實是鄉下姑娘自然的美！　　星期六的午后，茶房到寢室裏去洗地板，他把房門一推開，見小毛被一個大學生擁在懷裏·茶房幾乎氣得昏倒了！小毛見了爸爸，也嚇得躱在門角裏了！當時茶房丢了水桶，高聲大駡起來··　　「你這狗東西！你侮辱我的女兒！我要到法廳去告你！」　　「茶房！不要鬧！我給你的錢就是。」大學生說··　　「誰要你的臭銅錢！要你賠償我女兒的名譽！」茶房說··　　「怎末賠償法呢？······」大學生又說··　　「嘿！······我的女兒没有人要了，你要娶她爲妻！」茶房說··　　「好，茶房，不要鬧了！我依你的吧？」他用緩兵之計撲滅茶房的怒火。　　「口說不能爲憑，現在你要寫下婚約來！」茶房說··　　他被茶房逼得無可奈何！只得在抽屜裏取出一張紙，寫了一紙定婚約交給茶房。茶房苦苦地要他簽名蓋章，大學生無論如何不肯答應。茶房又用拳頭擊他的書案鬧起來了！弄得没有辦法的時候，他也依茶房的手續做過了。茶房也扶着他女兒的手，在他的名字旁邊歪歪倒倒地寫了王小毛三字。茶房把這張婚約藏在懷裏·面上帶着快樂的微笑，走出了他的寢室。上海故事上海故事（一二）周容編譯　　第四章修訂土地章程（續）　　Ｘ章程之第十條此次新訂章程，以第十條最爲重要，該條原文如下··　　凡辦事公局之董事，應由各執業租主及有關議事人照第九欵會議按後開章程選舉，董事員數，多不得過九位，少不得逾五人，以便將照章捐項抽收，及收捐欵存候照例支用，並章程内一切應辦之事，均宜切實遵行，以資妥善，故該董事選充之後，即當給以全權，辦理捐欵收支等事，倘有不遵章付捐者，即由局董投該管官署控追，並將欠捐人房地扣留作抵，或抄取貨物器具拍賣抵賞，以重捐項。　　此項條文，以一切政府最高權力付之於租界當局，如收捐，警察以及交通等權從自悉落於外人之手矣。至於此次所附加之新條文，因未得公使團體之同意，於是工部局之職權與地位，遲至二十年之後，始得香港英國法院之追認。　　但有一事不可不注意，即此次新章之中，巳承認中國政府在租界内之主權，租界章程中，曾規定對中國政府年納地租若干，所有地契，均應送請中國官廳蓋印。Ｘ華人納稅　　在此項章程之中，對於華人在租界内是否可以租屋購地，並無規定。當時華人避亂遷居租界者甚多，於是租界當局遂命華人各納房捐（即巡捕捐）百分之八，以爲受租界保護之代價。租界内外人連同眷屬不過三百人，華人初僅五百，小刀會亂後，驟增至二萬人，其中不少殷富之家。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Provisional Central Political Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Discussion of Sun Ke's Resignation</p>
<p>Wang Explains Political Principles</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the adjournment of today's Standing Committee meeting of the Central Executive Committee, it was generally felt that the national crisis was becoming more urgent and that a policy decision was needed. Therefore, a provisional Central Political Conference was convened continuously. Jiang Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek) chaired the meeting. A rough outline of the discussions, as learned by this news agency, is as follows: (1) The issue of Sun Ke's resignation: Since Sun Ke resigned from the Executive Yuan and went to Shanghai, public administration has been somewhat stagnant. Zhang Ji stood up and reported on his mission to Shanghai to persuade Sun to return, but Sun's intention to resign was firm, and he was unable to meet with him, resulting in no success. After Zhang's report, several committee members spoke in succession. Ultimately, it was decided that the position of the President of the Executive Yuan could not remain vacant, and Wang Zhaoming was once again requested to take on the responsibility despite his illness, in accordance with the original proposal. (2) Increase in the number of Foreign Affairs Committee members: A committee member proposed that the Foreign Affairs Committee was originally intended to bring together specialized talent in order to gather ideas and benefit from collective wisdom. Therefore, it was suggested that Wang Tu-chieh and Zhou Gengsheng be added as members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. (3) Explanation of Political Principles: Wang Zhaoming, in response to recent reports in the foreign press that Hu Hanmin had stated that the Executive Yuan could not directly exercise the powers of a responsible cabinet, and that Chen Youren had issued a declaration stating that a certain committee member opposed his policy towards Japan, preventing him from exercising his powers, repeatedly explained the misunderstanding. He emphasized that China's current political system is a responsible cabinet system, with the Executive Yuan directly responsible to the Central Political Conference. Policies set by the Executive Yuan must be formally discussed and approved by the Political Conference to be legal. As for debates in discussion meetings, these are normal occurrences and cannot be immediately construed as creating difficulties in the exercise of power. Given the deepening national crisis, it is especially hoped that the spirit of sincerity and unity will be upheld. Consequently, the committees resolved to issue a statement in the name of the Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference to clarify the various points reported by the Hong Kong Telegraph. (4) Discussion of Foreign Policy: A general decision was made, with the understanding that the Foreign Affairs Committee would review it before further discussion at an extended provisional Central Political Conference, which continued from 8 PM last night. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 28th, after the adjournment of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, a discussion meeting of the Central Political Conference was convened to discuss foreign affairs and the responsibilities of the Executive Yuan. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that Hu Hanmin sent a telegram to Nanjing, stating that Sun Ke's resignation was due to obstruction by others, preventing him from directly bearing the responsibility of administration. The Central Executive Committee members in Nanjing decided to send a joint telegram to Hu, explaining the circumstances of Sun Ke's resignation and adding clarifications. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Shizeng, the acting Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai, went to Shanghai to inspect and carried a letter from Chen Mingshu, urging Sun Ke to return to Nanjing. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Concrete Decisions Made on Policy Towards Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After several hours of deliberation on the 27th, the Foreign Affairs Committee made concrete decisions on the policy towards Japan. Yesterday, the Central Political Conference reviewed the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee in great detail. The results are being kept secret. It is rumored that the remarks made by Chen Youren upon his resignation, stating that he could not implement a policy of severing diplomatic relations with Japan, were also discussed. A certain important person defended what was right and wrong, and the conference resolved to issue an important declaration refuting Chen's statement. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the policy towards Japan at Shen Ke (3 PM) today, with Jiang Zuobin presiding. The meeting had not adjourned by 7 PM. Before the meeting, a certain committee member spoke about the policy towards Japan, stating that because of the different strengths and weaknesses of all parties, the only option was to temporarily endure, and slowly seek to reorganize and strengthen the nation's foundations. The outcome of the meeting was a consensus on taking a cautious approach. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a second instruction to Yan Huiqing, stating that after passing the Central Political Conference on the 27th, it was sent to Geneva that evening. However, it is rumored that the proposal to raise Articles 15 and 16 may indicate abandonment. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the policy towards Japan was decided at the extraordinary meeting of the Central Political Conference on the evening of the 28th. The general direction is still to focus on the League of Nations and to promote an international conference. It was decided that negotiations with Japan would not be conducted under duress. Regarding Ambassador Yan's request to invoke Article 10 of the Covenant, it is rumored that it is generally believed that this article is more flexible, and Yan has been instructed to act accordingly. According to a certain committee member, the policy set by the Central Government this time, he believes, will be defensible to the people in the future, and the various committees, including Jiang (Chiang), Wang, etc., are also very willing to take responsibility and will definitely not allow the people to suffer unnecessary sacrifices.

<h3 id="e5">League of Nations Drafts Declaration <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Without Legal Value</p>
<p>Concluding Discussion of Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations is currently working to find a solution to address the new developments between China and Japan in Manchuria and Shanghai. A closed-door meeting was held at 4 PM today and adjourned at 5:15 PM to allow this work to proceed without obstruction. A small committee of representatives from Britain, France, Spain, and Norway is currently drafting a declaration to uphold the principles of the League of Nations Charter. The declaration will elaborate on the importance of the Open Door Policy in Manchuria and will include a special statement regarding the status of Shanghai. It is now believed by members of the Council that the Manchurian negotiations cannot be indefinitely delayed, as they were in Paris last month. Therefore, they intend to strive to find a solution that can be considered satisfactory by all parties. The drafting committee met for two hours tonight. Although they were unable to complete the full text of the declaration, the main points have already been agreed upon. The document is currently three pages long, and it is expected that the other eight members of the Council will agree to it. However, it is not intended to submit the document to the Chinese and Japanese representatives for their approval. Therefore, the document has no legal value. After the document is approved by all members of the Council except for the Chinese and Japanese members, it will be read aloud by Council President Pengu (Paul Hymans) at a public meeting. It is expected that the Council will adjourn after the declaration is read. The content of the declaration cannot be released until tomorrow because a plenary meeting will be held tomorrow. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held a closed-door meeting at 4 PM today. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese representatives attended. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM. No decision was made on the second step of action regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. A public meeting will be held at 10:30 AM on Thursday to handle the items on the agenda. It is rumored that the Commission of Inquiry is scheduled to depart from Le Havre, France, on February 3rd, travel through Canada, and then take a ship to Yokohama. Before going to Manchuria, they will also visit Nanjing. The Council has resolved to avoid making new resolutions on the Liaoning issue. It has now ordered the drafting committee to draft a declaration to be read by Council President Pengu to express the Council's views, which must be adhered to by both the Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Yan Huiqing and the Japanese Chief Representative Sato. Those in Geneva are now advocating that the Council should completely clear all cases submitted to the Council before the opening of the Disarmament Conference on February 2nd, so as to avoid interfering with the Disarmament Conference. Therefore, the Council must await the report of the Commission of Inquiry. Although the members of the Council currently seem weak, those in the meeting stated emphatically that if the Japanese army or navy occupies Shanghai, the League of Nations will take swift and most forceful action to deal with it. Moreover, with the Disarmament Conference being held in Geneva, the Council can be convened at any time, with the attendance of all foreign ministers, and representatives participating in the Disarmament Conference can be summoned to the special review meeting of the League of Nations, simply by telegraphing to the government for credentials. The Council's handling of the Liaoning case has been weak. Therefore, all sectors of the League of Nations, especially representatives of small countries, have expressed complaints and advocated that the entire Sino-Japanese case be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly for a public decision. Because several members of the Council opposed the Council expressing sympathy for the move by US Secretary of State Stimson on January 8th, sending similar notes to China and Japan, today's meeting discussed (without the attendance of Chinese and Japanese representatives) whether to suggest that Japan formally announce in a public meeting that it would abide by the Open Door Policy in Manchuria, as stated in Japan's reply to Stimson. According to Stimson's note, it demanded the maintenance of the Open Door Policy and declared that the United States would not recognize any facts created by Japan in China as legitimate. Today's debate by the Council focused on this point. British representative Cecil argued that citing Stimson's note in President Pengu's declaration would be tantamount to endorsing the US note. (27th Kuomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that the Council has agreed that after the warning issued by French representative Pengu and British representative Cecil on Tuesday regarding the Shanghai case, as far as the Council is concerned, it can be considered concluded. It is said that the two representatives, Pengu and Cecil, told the Chinese and Japanese representatives to the League of Nations that any further expansion of the Shanghai case would cause international disputes that would be even more serious than those arising from the Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces. (27th Kuomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's public meeting of the League of Nations Council, when discussing the report of the Economic Committee, the Chinese representative called attention to the repercussions of the Manchurian Incident on the world economic downturn. The unrest caused by the Liaoning case has caused panic, and important Chinese markets have been closed, thus affecting the entire world. Therefore, this situation urgently needs relief.

<h3 id="e6">United States Considers Economic Blockade Against Japan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>United States Seeks British Opinion</p>
<p>Britain Decides Not to Take Concerted Action</p>
<p>New York The United States is currently awaiting Britain's response to its suggestion that the United States and Britain should take a common stance to oppose Japan's "aggression" against China. According to special correspondents in Washington, judging from appearances, the US government is now going to take concrete action. Government officials are now studying the dangerous developments in Shanghai with undisguised solemnity. Non-official circles have proposed two possible actions: (1) The United States and Britain exert economic pressure on Japan, including banning trade in Japanese goods; (2) The British and American navies conduct a coordinated show of force in Chinese waters. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that US Secretary of State Stimson recently spoke with British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, and informally suggested that Britain coordinate with the United States to implement an economic boycott against Japan in order to curb Japan's aggressive policy toward China. Britain has not yet expressed its views on this suggestion, because the United States will not make a concrete decision before knowing Britain's policy. It is rumored that several of President Hoover's advisors now believe that a stern warning from the White House regarding the possible actions of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai would be effective. However, some also believe that Japan already knows the US attitude and that there is no need to reiterate the US position. President Hoover's cabinet is now seriously considering warning Japan not to commit atrocities in Shanghai in order to salvage the possibility of reversing the events in the East. Political circles here have not denied this. It is rumored that the State Department and the British Embassy have been informally discussing cooperation between the two countries to protect British and American nationals in Shanghai. (27th Kuomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson has discussed the situation in Manchuria and Shanghai with various officials, but he has not indicated what steps the United States intends to take. This morning, Stimson discussed this issue with the British and Italian ambassadors, and then met with the Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department for a long time. The content was not disclosed, but some officials expect that the United States may take very concrete action regarding the recent developments in the Sino-Japanese dispute. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London Regarding the current incident in Shanghai, Britain has decided to take a proactive stance to protect nationals residing in China. However, according to government sources, the British government is unlikely to join in a concerted action of economic boycott against Japan. The United States may issue warnings or scoldings regarding the actions of the Japanese military, but Britain feels that it may be satisfied if Japan can solemnly declare its attitude. The strategy of joint economic boycott against Japan proposed by US Secretary of State Stimson to British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, has been carefully considered by the British government, but the Foreign Office has not been able to adopt any decision, and it is feared that the US government's suggestion has not yet reached the point where the British government can agree to it. (28th Kuomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government sources here have heard that Britain has decided not to take concerted action with the US government to deal with Japan with an economic blockade. Therefore, officials in the State Department are now discussing what measures to take against Japan. Many believe that the United States will issue a moderate warning to the Tokyo government regarding Japan's actions in Shanghai, stating that the incident is sufficient to endanger world peace. On the other hand, they feel that this warning will not have any effect, because Japan has ignored all similar warnings in the past. Responsible officials in Washington say that if the United States wants to adopt a policy of economic blockade, banning exports to Japan and prohibiting the import of Japanese goods, it must first obtain the approval of Congress. Secretary of State Stimson is still deeply considering his attitude toward the current incident in Shanghai and the general Sino-Japanese dispute, and it is expected that he will make a statement soon. (27th Kuomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The United States and Britain are currently consulting on the US suggestion. Other than this announcement today, no further details are available in political circles. Public concern about the status of Shanghai is spreading, and all newspapers are printing the latest details of the deployment in Shanghai in large letters, but there is little commentary. The Star said that Japan is good at explanations and ultimata, and now it is resisting world opinion. It also said that the United States and Britain are united on a policy of close understanding, which is the way to seek a compromise in a broken situation. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Dispatching Large Numbers of Warships to Shanghai</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy issued a statement today regarding the dispatch of warships to Shanghai, reiterating the anti-Japanese actions within China and stating that these actions are tantamount to an unarmed war. It concluded by saying that if China does not heed the warnings, the Navy will have no choice but to take sufficient action to protect Japanese lives and interests, because the Japanese have now reached the end of their tether. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the countermeasures of the Ministry of the Navy regarding the Shanghai Incident, warships were increased on the 26th, and a statement was reissued at 7 PM last night stating that the anti-Japanese movement in various parts of China is rooted in years of xenophobia, and is not a matter of one day or night. It has become more intense since the Manchurian Incident, as the world knows. The Japanese Navy has been steady and self-respecting, striving to protect Japanese residents and uphold their rights and interests. As for the Shanghai Incident, the National Government has no sincerity in acknowledging Japan's reasonable and appropriate demands and is oppressing Japanese residents by such means. According to recent intelligence, it is formally preparing for war against Japan with regular troops. The Japanese Navy hopes that China will stop such actions. Four destroyers and the special service ship Notoro have already been added. On the 26th, the mine warfare squadron and marines were also added. Although the Japanese Navy hopes for a peaceful resolution of the situation, in the event that the National Government refuses to repent and does not stop illegal actions, Japan will have no choice but to take appropriate action in self-defense to protect Japanese residents and uphold acquired rights, with the aim of leaving no regrets. (28th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the increasingly dangerous situation in Shanghai, the Ministry of the Navy issued standby orders at 2 PM today to the following fleets: (1) The 1st Air Fleet, aircraft carriers "Kaga" and "Hosho," and the 2nd Destroyer Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Takayoshi Kato; (2) The 1st Fleet, 3rd Squadron, cruisers "Naka," "Abukuma," and "Yura," commanded by Rear Admiral Teikichi Hori. It is reported that the aircraft carrier "Kaga" is currently berthed in Sasebo. The "Hosho" and the 2nd Destroyer Squadron are scheduled to depart from Yokosuka for Sasebo tomorrow. The "Naka" and "Abukuma" are also scheduled to depart from Kure for Sasebo tomorrow to await orders to deploy. (28th Japanese Alliance Dispatch)</p>

However, recently, Yu Shencheng has recruited bandits to disrupt the local area and has even allowed his partisans to occupy important institutions in Harbin, destroying order, so that the months of hard work by our troops to maintain Harbin have been in vain. Now, the various troops in the Northeast have risen up to suppress the rebels, sincerely supporting the chief of the special region and protecting all foreign merchants and residents with care.

<p>Contains a Note of Protest</p>
<p>Aizawa Explains Reasons</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Reuters learned tonight that the US State Department has requested the Japanese government to inform the US government of the specific actions it plans to take in Shanghai. It is rumored that the document cannot be regarded as a protest, but it is more serious than a simple inquiry. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to avoid misunderstandings in various countries regarding the actions of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, Japanese Foreign Minister Aizawa has ordered Japanese diplomatic representatives stationed abroad to explain the reasons why the Japanese Navy took this action. Aizawa stated today that if the Chinese authorities continue to allow anti-Japanese groups and other lawless elements to continue their illegal activities, Japan will be forced to take severe measures to defend itself and protect Japanese nationals in Shanghai and elsewhere in China. It is now reported that three more warships have been ordered to prepare to set sail for Shanghai. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today to guests that the fear that Japanese troops will take action in the International Settlement is absolutely unfounded. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council has long closed down anti-Japanese organizations within the International Settlement, the actions of the Japanese army will henceforth be limited to using force to close down anti-Japanese groups outside the Settlement and to retrieve illegally detained goods. The spokesman also expressed regret over Washington's excessive concern, saying that the Japanese authorities hope to avoid violence. The actions of the Japanese military are largely intended to quell the public anger of the Japanese people, because if the authorities do not take action, the Japanese people may take matters into their own hands.

<h3 id="e16">The Real Strength of the Japanese Army in Shanghai Triggered (Silent) <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, our authorities have been tolerant everywhere, and even fully accepted the demands of the Japanese. The reason for enduring humiliation and making this act of submission is not only to maintain the security of the entire Shanghai port, but also for fear that once military action is launched, it will spread and become unmanageable. However, our authorities have endured humiliation and pain, but still cannot satisfy the Japanese intentions, and they must launch an attack to vent their anger. What a painful matter this is!</p>
<p>However, after military action is launched, to what extent will it develop, and to what extent will sacrifices be made? No one can predict it. What must be declared to the world is that the people of our country have always been peace-loving people. Since the September 18th Northeast Incident occurred, they have never taken a resistant attitude. On the one hand, they respected the recommendations of the League of Nations and listened to the League's arrangements. However, the League of Nations has advised Japan three times, but Japan has consistently ignored it. The people of our country, although very angry, still adhere to peace. Now that the Shanghai incident has occurred, the people of our country are also very excited. However, since Shanghai is the center of economy and commerce, even during the time when the League of Nations was holding meetings, we did not make strong demands in the League of Nations. On the Shanghai side, we even accepted the Japanese conditions with tears. We believe that our preservation of peace can be said to be the ultimate. Now, the US government in Washington is concerned about the situation in Shanghai and is seeking ways to contain the expansion of the incident. The League of Nations is also paying close attention to the situation in Shanghai and is seeking to maintain peace in Shanghai. However, it is unexpected that the Japanese side, after forcing us to accept its conditions, is still launching military action, without regard to the friendship between China and Japan, and without regard to the concern and attention of the League of Nations and the United States. They blatantly used violence. Our country has reached this point, and it is impossible to endure any longer. We cannot but rise up and make a legitimate defense. How the League of Nations and the United States will deal with this matter in the future, how to contain the expansion of military action, and how to uphold justice and maintain peace, we do not want to ask. We only hope that the League of Nations will pay attention to the truth of this incident and distinguish the right from wrong.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Li Shizeng discussed the history of the refund of the Boxer Indemnity from various countries, saying that after multiple efforts by himself, Tao Zhixing, Guo Bingwen, Zhang Ji, Wang Jingwei, and others, success was achieved in 1920. It was decided that the indemnity would be used for independent education expenses and construction projects. In 1927, the Nanjing National Government had already decided to stabilize the indemnity plan and its uses: (1) to carry out construction projects; (2) to deposit the funds in the Ministry of Finance to earn interest for education. The nature of the indemnity is divided into three types: one is fully managed by the government, such as the Russian, German, and Austrian indemnities, which are used in the same way as the above items; two, the British, French, American, and Belgian indemnities are managed and used by people sent by our country and the countries concerned jointly forming a board of directors or a committee. The US runs Tsinghua, and the UK purchases materials for construction. Italy and Japan have promised to return the money but have not yet started, and the management method cannot be discussed in terms of management and control. The first type is deposited in the national treasury to generate interest, and the second type is agreed upon by a special committee, and no one country can handle it alone. For the third type, the funds have not arrived. Recently, there have been rumors that Cheng Yanqiu went abroad and was allocated 100,000 yuan from the indemnity, and that Cai Song borrowed money using the Russian indemnity as collateral, and that Li gave gifts. If the above situation is understood, this will be clear without explanation. Drama is related to culture, and I agree, but the funds cannot be used by individuals. Cai Song's borrowing of money is based on interest collateral, and there is no need for me to give favors. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwest Foreign Affairs Association issued a circular telegram on the 27th, correcting Chiang's diplomatic policy toward Japan, stating that at present, the most important thing for the country is to eliminate everything and quickly sever diplomatic relations with Japan and declare war. Perhaps there is a chance to survive from death. If we continue to beg the League of Nations for pity, it will be tantamount to digging our own grave. If the Premier were still alive, in such a serious situation, he would definitely lead comrades and compatriots to deal with the violent Japanese with black iron and red blood, and would never tolerate humiliation and retreat, thus committing suicide.

<h3 id="e44">Control Yuan Impeaches Two Public Officials <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Wu Zhilian and Yu Shunqian Neglect Their Duties and Betray the Country</p>
<p>The Control Yuan's impeachment case against Wu Zhilian, Secretary of the Judicial Yuan, and Yu Shunqian, Director of the Jing City Land Bureau, for neglecting their duties and betraying the country, is presented as follows: "According to a proposal by Control Yuan member Wang Pingzheng, an investigation was conducted based on a complaint from citizen Ye Fuying and others accusing Wu Zhilian, Secretary of the Judicial Yuan, and Yu Shunqian, Director of the Nanjing Municipal Government Land Bureau, of neglecting their duties and betraying the country. This Yuan dispatched Secretary Zhang Gongzhen to investigate. According to the report, it was found that Wu Zhilian, in the name of the agent of the Japanese Saito Risuke, applied to the Jing City Land Bureau in August of this year to survey multiple acres of land in the area of Erlang Temple Cai Family Garden Yanling Lane Gong Alley in this city. In the application form, the owner was listed as the Japanese Saito Risuke, and Wu Zhilian identified himself as Saito's agent. Regarding the owner's certificate, there was only one land lease contract signed by Wu Zhilian and Saito. The lessee in the contract was also Wu Zhilian, who was the lessee as an agent. In addition, there was a certificate from the Japanese Consulate. After verification, inquiries were made with residents in the vicinity, who stated that the Japanese had been given this land by Qi Xieyuan and Wang Guilin many years ago. It had neither been registered with the local authorities as required nor had it been filed in accordance with Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Land and Houses by Foreign Churches in the Interior promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Wu Zhilian, as the Secretary of the Judicial Yuan, and acting as the real estate agent of a foreigner, has lost his status as a public official. The period was precisely on the day of the promulgation of the Regulations on Public Officials' Service. It is unknown what Wu Zhilian relied on to recognize the Japanese as the owner of the land and even act as both the lessee and the agent of the owner, signing a 30-year lease contract with the Japanese and immediately applying for a license to build a commercial building in the name of Heji Industrial Company. Furthermore, the Jing City Land Bureau requires people applying for land surveys to submit their deeds for verification and repeated surveys before granting clearance. However, this time, the survey of the land was based solely on the contract signed by the agent Wu Zhilian and the lessee Wu Zhilian. Because they had a certificate from the Japanese Consulate, it was recognized as representing all the legal documents and a single map was issued. From then on, the Japanese could enjoy the permanent and official ownership of the land without any recourse. This is the factual situation of the case after investigation, which is submitted along with the attachments. Wu Zhilian is the Secretary of the Judicial Yuan, but he disregarded the national land rights and the various laws and regulations on land registration and transfer, colluded with the Japanese in private, and signed a lease contract to achieve his private speculation and profit-seeking plan, which is a violation of Article 9 of the Regulations on Public Officials' Service and should be severely punished. As for Yu Shunqian, as the Director of the Bureau, how carefully should he handle the registration of land by foreigners? Now that the Japanese are not establishing a church, school, or hospital, they have no right to lease or purchase land in this capital. There is no document proving the transfer of the land they have acquired, and they have not followed the filing procedures. On what basis did the Bureau publicly recognize the Japanese as the owner and acknowledge Wu Zhilian's contract, which was managed by the agent and lessee, and did not require them to submit the contract for verification as required before issuing the map? After investigating this case, it is clear that Wu Zhilian colluded with the Japanese in private to transfer land rights, and Yu Shunqian colluded with Wu Zhilian to cheat and provide a double guarantee for the Japanese's illegal possession of land rights. Their crimes are the same, and there is no way to forgive them. It is requested that they be handed over for punishment together, and the Executive Yuan should be instructed to order the Nanjing Municipal Government to revoke the map issued by the Land Bureau and stop the issuance of licenses by the Public Works Bureau. After Liu Woqing and Yu Hongqi Gao Lu, members of the Control Yuan, were assigned to review the case, they reported that after reviewing the case, they believed that Wu Zhilian colluded with the Japanese to privately sign a lease contract and obscurely obtain land rights, which was already a violation of official regulations. Moreover, the land is in the capital. If lawless villains in the city are allowed to continue their evildoing, not only will they use their position to seek personal gain, but they will also disregard national sovereignty and collude with foreigners, taking advantage of the law to seek honor and cause foreign troubles. As for Yu Shunqian, Director of the Jing City Land Bureau, he only relied on a certificate from the Japanese and did not carry out the procedures for verifying the deed before issuing the map. If he was not colluding with Wu Zhilian to seek profits, he was disregarding the law and betraying his duties. It is requested that they be handed over for punishment together in accordance with the law, and the Executive Yuan should be requested to instruct the Municipal Government to immediately revoke the map and stop the issuance of licenses to prevent disputes. This case involves high-ranking officials seeking personal gain, betraying national rights, and should be requested to be severely punished as a warning to others."</p>
<h3 id="e45">Red Bandits Slaughter and Wash Out Shicheng County, Jiangxi Province <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>People's Militia Fought Bloodily with Red Bandits for Months</p>
<p>Many Small Villages Were Destroyed and Many People Died</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanchang reports: Shicheng is located in a remote area on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian, bordering Ruijin, Yudu, and Tinghang. The folk customs are fierce and the best in the province. Therefore, the county's people's militia is known for its bravery and skill in battle. Small groups of Red Bandits are often defeated by them. However, after Zhu Mao Peng suffered heavy losses at Gaoshengxu in Xingguo last year, they fled to the area of Shicheng, Ruijin, Yudu, Tingzhou, Liancheng, and Ninghua, and held a fake National Soviet Representative Congress in the mountains of Shicheng. At that time, Zhu Mao's main force was concentrated in the three counties of Shi, Rui, and Ting. The county seat had already been captured by them. The people's militia in various parts of Shicheng retreated to the various mountain villages and earth forts, relying on the dangers to defend to the death. Refugees helped the old and carried the young, following like ants attached to a document. However, the Red Bandits coveted the people's militia's guns and hated their anti-communism so much that they would not be satisfied unless they were obtained. Therefore, Shicheng was slaughtered and washed out by the Red Bandits. Recently, I met a gentleman who escaped from Shi to the province. According to him, the entire territory of Shicheng is mountainous, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. The Red Bandits always wanted to occupy it as a bandit's nest. Fortunately, the people's militia worked hard to suppress them, so the entire county has not yet been communized. In September of last year, Zhu Mao again sent Peng Dehuai's fake Fourth Army and Lin Biao's fake Eleventh Army and Luo Binghui, by Ruijin attacked Shicheng in an attempt to eliminate the people's militia and absorb their guns. At that time, there were seven mountain villages and eleven earth forts in the county. The people's militia fought bloodily with them for months, until their ammunition was exhausted and reinforcements were cut off, and they were successively lost. Only the two mountain villages of Hongshi and Yunjing, which are known for their steepness, were still able to protect refugees from Yudu, Ruijin, Ningdu, and Ninghua, and were mostly inhabited inside. The defenses were extremely strong, and the food supply was also prepared in sufficient quantities, estimated to last for two years. However, the Communists still launched a full-scale attack. In December, the Ningdu rebel soldiers joined the fake Fourth Army, and on the morning of New Year's Day this year, they continuously fired several heavy artillery pieces at the village, as densely as a string of firecrackers. Several shells hit the village gate, destroying the city walls and burning the houses. Later, the earth nitrate caught fire, making it impossible to approach, and the entire village was burned down. More than half of the villagers died, and the entire village was lost. After the bandits entered the village, they killed everyone they met, and the corpses piled up like mountains. They also seized more than 200 rifles, dozens of Mauser pistols, and more than ten sedan guns, losing property worth millions of dollars. Huang Guanying, a member of the Party and Government Committee, and more than 1,700 civilians were all bound. Recently, the bandits have become more violent due to the loss of the two villages, burning and killing everywhere, and washing everything away. Therefore, the number of refugees fleeing the county is increasing day by day, with tens of thousands of people displaced in Lichuan, Qingliu, Jianning, and Ninghua, without clothing or food, dying and looking at each other in extremely tragic conditions.

<h3 id="e46">Liu Guitang's Troops Departed from Wenkou <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Telegram: Han Fuqu sent Senior Advisor Cheng Xixian as his plenipotentiary representative on the 23rd, along with Aide-de-Camp Director Meng Guangshan, transporting 1,300 sets of military uniforms along with Liu Guitang's representatives Xia Ziming and Li Ziming, etc., to Da Wenkou by special train, to meet with Liu Guitang, and negotiate the date of departure. They arrived at Wenkou at 6:30 PM. Xia Ziming first conveyed to Liu the intentions of Han's dispatch of Cheng and others to Wenkou, saying that Chairman Han was unable to finish making the military uniforms in time, so he first brought 1,300 sets, and the rest would be made later. He only hoped to depart as soon as possible to Gaotang, the designated location. If everyone had any doubts, Cheng Commander (i.e., Cheng Xixian) could be ordered to depart with the train as a guarantee, and so on. Liu said that it was not impossible for his troops to depart by train, but Guo Mafeng, Yin Shigui, Yin Shixi, and others were going out of the mountains for the first time and were inevitably suspicious. This matter still had to be discussed with them. That night, Liu Guitang, Guo Mafeng, Yin Shigui, Yin Shixi, and others held a meeting. All the leaders were willing to depart by train, but the soldiers were still inevitably suspicious, so it was decided to depart by both train and on foot to save face on both sides. Liu Guitang, Guo Mafeng, Yin Shigui, Yin Shixi, and others led Liu's troops, Liu Huaizhi's Second Regiment, and those who were not wearing military uniforms on foot, departing from Da Wenkou on the morning of the 25th, staying overnight in Xiazhang (40 li), the next day staying overnight in Feicheng (50 li), the third day passing through Wangzhaodian (15 li) and Zhangjiadian (20 li) and staying overnight in Shuili Pu (30 li), the third day crossing the Yellow River from Pingyin and staying overnight in Huguantun (60 li), the fifth day passing through Xingzhai (50 li) and Yangguantun (15 li) and arriving in Gaotang (20 li). From Gaotang, they would then gather at Yaozhan. Liu's First Regiment, Wu Lianjie's troops, and those wearing military uniforms from other units, along with office staff, would depart north on two trains on the morning of the 25th, passing through Jinan to Yucheng and Beizhangzhuang to get off the train and go to Yaozhan to gather. This morning, this plan was communicated to Cheng Xixian, who agreed to return to Jinan to convey it to Chairman Han. At 2:00 PM, Cheng took the original train back to Jinan and reported to the Provincial Government. Han heard that Han could agree to this matter and it was resolved. Two empty trains departed from Tai'an to Da Wenkou today to prepare for transportation. (January 24)</p>
<p>Jinan Continued Telegram: Liu Guitang's troops, who had been stranded in Da Wenkou for two weeks, were completely resolved after Cheng Xixian's visit to Wenkou. This morning (the 25th), they all departed from Da Wenkou in two groups. Liu Guitang, Guo Wensheng, Yin Shi, and others led those who were walking first, with no more than a quarter of them wearing military uniforms and civilian clothes. After the pedestrians departed, those taking the train boarded the train with national flags inserted. The first train, led by Liu's Aide-de-Camp Director Chen Yide, departed at 8:00 AM. The second train, led by Liu's First Regiment Commander Wu Lianjie and Aide-de-Camp Zhang Jingjing, departed at 8:30 AM. The first train arrived in Jinan at 1:50 PM, and the second train arrived in Jinan at 1:30 PM. Cheng Xixian, a senior hall official sent by Han, arrived at the station, issued living expenses, and gave a brief speech, urging them to pay for their purchases along the way and not to harass the local area. At 2:20 PM, the first train departed, and at 3:00 PM, the second train departed, leaving Jinan to Zhangzhuang to get off the train and go to Yaozhan to gather. It is reported that after Liu's troops arrive in Gaotang, Han will send Cheng Xixian to Yaozhan to check their guns and numbers in order to reorganize them into a division and give them a title.

There are 42 county chambers of commerce and 17 town chambers of commerce, totaling 59. The number of legally established chambers of commerce on file with the Department of Industry and Commerce has exceeded two-thirds. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce is now reporting to the Provincial Party Department, requesting the issuance of a permit and the dispatch of personnel for guidance. As for the preparations for the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, in February of last year, when representatives of the county chambers of commerce came to Zhenjiang to discuss the business tax, they had already recommended the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Nantong, Tongshan, Wuxian, Wuxi, Changzhou, Wujiang, and Gaoyou to take charge. Once the instructor from the Provincial Party Department is appointed and the permit is issued, a preparatory meeting will be convened to draft the articles of association, and then a general meeting will be held to elect officers.</p>

<p>Chen Tiaoyuan, due to the urgent need for military pay for his troops, specially sent personnel to Wuhu yesterday, instructing Li Gengchang, the Wuhu Customs Superintendent, to temporarily allocate 50,000 yuan from the customs revenue to meet the urgent needs. If this cannot be done, then personnel will have to be sent to the customs to collect it. Superintendent Li and Wuhu Customs Commissioner Iida Taro have separately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Inspector General of Customs, requesting instructions for handling the matter.</p>
<p>Here, due to the diplomatic relations, the military and police are intensifying their vigilance over local security. Since yesterday, they have been implementing checks on pedestrians every night. After the Shanghai incident, the anti-Japanese attitude of the schools became even more激昂, declaring their willingness to fight the enemy with their bare hands. There is currently a Japanese warship anchored in Wuhu.</p>
<p>Bandits attacked Liu'an, and the county seat is in danger. In addition to ordering Yang Mingfang's 163rd Brigade stationed in Anqing to rush to suppress them, Chen Tiaoyuan yesterday added a regiment from a certain brigade to rush to assist. Hefei, being adjacent to Liu'an, is filled with fear. Local businesses here recently received a telegram stating that the gates of Hefei have been closed and pedestrians are being inspected. A large number of bandits were suddenly discovered in Xuancheng County, southern Anhui, and many villages in the surrounding areas were harassed. The various circles of the county sent representatives to Wuhu to request troops. The headquarters of the 171st Brigade stationed in Wuhu originally planned to send the machine gun company of the 341st Regiment to suppress them today, but because they received a report that the bandits had been dispersed by the people's militia, they immediately stopped.

<p>The Zhenjiang Yangzhou Automobile Ferry is Robbed by Bandits. At 5:30 PM on the 27th, the Zhenjiang Yangzhou Automobile Company's ferry "Xinzhenjiang" was sailing from Zhen to Liuxu when six or seven bandits suddenly appeared halfway, one of whom was the leader, wearing a military uniform, speaking in a Chu-Yue accent. Three bandits held Mauser pistols, and the rest held daggers. They ordered the helmsman to sail east of Jiaoshan, and searched the passengers one by one for two hours. They ordered the ship to dock at Tushan Pass to land, but because the water was shallow, they ordered it to return and searched again, and changed the passengers' leather coats and overcoats. They threw the similar military uniforms into the middle of the river. When the ship was sailing near Jianbi, an oil tanker came head-on, and the bandits ordered the oil tanker to dock next to the ferry, jumped onto the oil tanker, and left. In this incident, passengers lost cash of about 10,000 yuan or more. Zhao, a quartermaster from the Supervisory Office, who had collected 3,000 yuan from the capital, was also robbed, and one passenger had a diamond ring worth about 5,000 yuan robbed.</p>

<p>The bandit situation and defense in the Wuyuan area. The Communist bandits led by Fang Shaozhou and Tang in the Gan-Northeast region are being jointly suppressed by the troops of Chiang, Dai, and Tang. The majority of the bandits have retreated to the vicinity of Yiyang Hengfeng Black Wind Cave, relying on the terrain for defense. The remaining scattered bandits and local Communists are causing disturbances in Leping, Dexing, Yiyang, Yujiang, and the border areas of Wuyuan. Recently, Huitian Ferry, 40 li from Leping County, was once occupied by bandit troops, who burned houses and looted people. The troops stationed in Leping under Ruan's command rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm, and the bandits retreated. Scattered bandits often infiltrate and plunder the borders of Yutan Caomen in Wuyuan and Haikou in Dexing. Although the Dexing border towns of Datiancai, Nuanshui, Raierdun, and the newly built Haikou all have stationed troops to prevent bandits, the bandits often attack just a few miles from the stationed troops, causing the bandit suppression forces to be exhausted and unable to defend effectively. Regarding the tickets seized in the rural areas of Wucheng earlier, except for three members of the self-defense corps who were released, the rest are still detained by the bandits. It is said that the Catholic priest was asked for 100,000 yuan, and Section Chief Yu of the county government was asked for 40,000 yuan. According to the released self-defense corps members, they were released in Hengfeng and given a pass by the bandits, sent to Village A by people from Village A, then to Village B by people from Village B, and then to Village C by people from Village C, stopping just before reaching Wuyuan. All along the way, there are existing agencies. The defense of Wucheng is still guarded by the camp of Han Changchuan. Recently, two more companies and mortars have been transferred from Huaqiao in Dexing to Wuyuan to strengthen its forces. The newly appointed magistrate of Wuyuan, Ke Kaiyun, has also come to Wuyuan to take office and has received 100 guns and 50 newly organized police officers from the provincial government to aid in defense. Therefore, public morale has been stabilized.</p>

<p>Our Troops Defended Themselves Justifiably</p>
<p>A Conflict Occurred Between Both Sides</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Notified All Consulates</p>
<p>And Protested to the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>The Authorities of the Chinese and Foreign Concessions</p>
<p>Both Declared Martial Law Yesterday</p>
<p>Last night, serious news spread from the foreign side. At 12:00 AM last night, Japanese marines attacked Zhabei. Initially, at 11:10 PM, a small squad of several dozen Japanese marines set out from the headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road to Tiantong'an, first occupying Tiantong'an Station. The station staff immediately left, but at this time, our 19th Route Army stationed in Zhabei remained quietly defending the line and did not fire. Around 12:00 AM, the Japanese marines used Tiantong'an Station as a base and launched attacks on our army's defense line in several squads. Our stationed troops believed that the conflict was initiated by the other side and had no choice but to resist, immediately rising up to fight. As such, Shanghai, where all parties were trying to ease tensions, suddenly became a state of war. The battle situation investigated on the ground by our reporter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tiantong'an Station: At 11:10 PM last night, a small squad of about several dozen Japanese marines, all carrying portable machine guns, riding motorcycles, and wearing white cloths on their arms, were led into Tiantong'an Station by plainclothes Japanese. At this time, the station staff all avoided the conflict and left. Our troops mostly scattered and lay in wait, quietly defending the line and remaining extremely calm.</p>
<p>Zhabei Street Fighting: Around 11:00 PM last night, Japanese marines in the Tiantong'an area first opened fire on our 19th Route Army defense forces with several rifle shots, and then charged towards our army's defense line on both sides of the Songhu Railway and Qiujiang Road. Our soldiers were extremely angry and displayed immense courage, using machine guns to fire. The Japanese army charged several times, but were repelled by our army. After this, both sides resisted with rifles. Until 12:50 AM, the Japanese army supplemented their forces from the rear and launched a fierce attack on our army. Our army fought back with all its might, and after fighting each other until 1:20 AM, the Japanese army still failed and retreated to the east of Tiantong'an. During the fierce battle between the two sides, the sound of machine guns never stopped. According to foreign sources, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses during the charge. From 1:30 AM onwards, the sound of gunfire became less frequent and gradually moved eastward towards Tiantong'an, presumably due to the Japanese army's retreat. However, at 1:50 AM, the sound of machine guns started again, and was very dense. The flashes of bullets could be seen on the roof of Songhu Station. The fierce battle continued until 2:30 AM, and the gunfire had not yet stopped. At the same time, more than a dozen gunshots were heard at the Baoshan Road intersection, and more than a dozen gunshots were also heard in the North Station area. The lights inside the station also went out immediately. At this time, the densest gunfire seemed to be between Qiujiang Road and Songhu Station. However, when the reporter left the vicinity of North Station at 2:40 AM this morning, the gunfire was less frequent again.</p>
<p>Contact at Jiangwan: After the Japanese army provoked at Tiantong'an Station, at the same time in Jiangwan, Japanese marines also made contact with the 6th Regiment of our 78th Division. Initially, there was only a conflict between sentries. For the sake of justifiable defense, our army immediately actively fought back. The Japanese army charged several times, but were repelled by our army. Our army's morale was high, and everyone fought with the strength of ten men. The battle continued until this newspaper went to press, and the Japanese army ultimately failed.</p>
<p>The Front Line Did Not Move: According to the latest news from this newspaper, as of 4:00 AM this morning, as a result of our army's brave fight, the front line had not moved at all. Our army captured three Japanese armored vehicles and destroyed one. Both sides suffered casualties.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire: At 2:40 AM this morning, while the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle, a large fire suddenly broke out north of Laobazi Road and Fuxing Road, and south of Tiantong'an Station. For a time, the fire was blazing, and the situation was huge. Because the area was in the war zone, the fire had not been extinguished by 3:50 AM.</p>
<p>Bombing Wusong: At around 10:00 PM last night, thirteen Japanese warships sailed into Sanjia Water and bombarded the Wusong Fort, firing thirty to forty shells. Our army initially actively fought back, but then suddenly became silent. The Japanese warships thought that the fort had been destroyed, and were about to land and occupy it, when our fort suddenly opened fire again, and the Japanese warships retreated slightly. After that, news between Shanghai and Wusong suddenly stopped, and the battle situation in Wusong is yet to be reported.</p>
<p>Headquarters News: According to news released by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Japanese naval commander stationed in Shanghai suddenly issued an emergency ultimatum to the Chinese authorities last night, ordering them to withdraw the Chinese troops from Zhabei to a suitable location at night. While our country's authorities were holding a meeting to discuss measures, the Japanese marines in the Qiujiang Road area of Zhabei had already clashed with Chinese soldiers, and gunshots suddenly rang out. As of 12:10 AM this morning, the telephone lines in Zhabei were completely cut off, and the telephone bureau staff had all fled. Even the Chinese and foreign telephone lines directly connecting to Zhabei were all cut off.</p>
<p>Sudden Rise of Aircraft: At 4:30 AM this morning, suddenly an aircraft flew from east to north and then to the southwest for aerial reconnaissance. At 4:45 AM, it turned again to fly towards Pudong, and then shuttled back and forth in the airspace of the concession for reconnaissance. It was still soaring in the sky when this newspaper went to press.</p>

Regarding the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations, in order to seek a peaceful resolution and maintain the peace and stability of this city, the mayor has fully accepted the four conditions proposed by the Japanese consul general, and has replied to the Japanese consul general in a letter at 1:45 PM today, expressing satisfaction. Unexpectedly, at 11:25 PM this evening (28th), the Municipal Public Security Bureau received an envelope from the Japanese consul general, containing two announcements from the commander of the First Overseas Fleet of Japan to the mayor and the director of the Public Security Bureau, stating that the Imperial Navy, in view of the fact that many Japanese nationals reside in the Zhabei area, intends to deploy troops there to maintain order and take responsibility for security. The commander hopes that the Chinese side will promptly withdraw all Chinese troops and their hostile facilities from the Zhabei area. Subsequently, at 12:00 AM that same night, the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report from Zhabei that the Japanese marines had begun free military action in the area and were attacking the Chinese area. The Japanese consul general has already replied to the municipal government, expressing satisfaction, but the Japanese navy has suddenly taken this kind of military action, which is quite astonishing.

Commander Dai replied that the policy towards Japan, whether it be peace or war, should be decided quickly, and the important key lies in internal unity and the consolidation of the central government. Fortunately, Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang have jointly entered Beijing, and the central government is responsible.

The troops of the 78th Division of this headquarters are left under the command of Army Commander Cai Tingkai in Shanghai. Commander Dai finally said that our army will never attack others first, but if the Japanese army attacks, our army cannot but resist. Success or failure is not a consideration.

<p>Key Areas Defended</p>
<p>Residents Panic</p>
<p>Strict Defense of Gaochang Temple: The Gaochang Temple area is an important military area, so martial law is the strictest. Sacks for defense work have been set up at the entrance of the arsenal.

Sandbags are also piled up behind the aircraft station, and the defense is extremely strict.</p>
<p>Precautions Taken by the Municipal Government: For thorough defense, the Municipal Government specially dispatched a police detachment from the Public Security Bureau and a platoon of police from the section chief of the Third District to deploy around the Municipal Government, both in front and behind. From 2:00 PM, it was ordered to close the gates of the Municipal Government to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Residents Moved Out One After Another: Rumors abounded in this city yesterday. Residents in Nanshi and the walled city inquired and informed each other, all in a state of panic.

<p>Residents Relocate</p>
<p>Trains Still Running</p>
<p>The situation in the Zhabei area yesterday morning was the same as the day before. At around 1:00 PM, because the Japanese residents in the area of Hongkou Shigaota Road and Jiangwan Road were moving their belongings into the concession, and the marines stationed in the Japanese primary school were also setting up machine guns, people were panic-stricken. Residents living in the Zhabei area rushed to avoid the conflict, some moving their entire families. As a result, the roads around Baoshan Road were filled with vehicles and pedestrians. However, there were too many vehicles and pedestrians, and obstacles were piled up on the road, so it was not possible to travel smoothly, and traffic was almost blocked. It was not until about 3:00 PM that it eased slightly. However, before long, it was learned that the concession would be under martial law after 4:00 PM, which caused another panic, and the situation was extremely chaotic for a time. Rickshaws suddenly raised their prices, but there was still more demand than supply. Until 4:30 PM, the concession closed the three iron gates at Kenenghai Road, North Henan Road, and Haining Road, and announced martial law. Later, because traffic was blocked,</p>

<p>it began to settle down slightly. Shops in the Baoxing Road area closed at around 4:00 PM. Shops along Baoshan Road also began to close one after another from 5:30 PM. There were few pedestrians on the road. The Fifth District Public Security Bureau dispatched all armed police officers to patrol and maintain order. All troops piled up sandbags, and soldiers guarded all the key passes, all armed and looking out from high places, but they did not stop pedestrians, so there was no obstruction to traffic. Songhu trains continued to run as usual. Japanese marines stationed outside the headquarters on North Sichuan Road posted sentries, and twelve armed soldiers stood guard at the gate, carrying guns. Armored vehicles shuttled back and forth on the road. The shops on both sides of the street near where the Japanese soldiers were stationed closed early. The trains arriving and departing from North Station continued to run as usual. When the panic occurred, the staff of the Railway Bureau were not without panic, but the staff of the Traffic Department and the station continued to work as before. All passengers arriving in Shanghai on various trains were unable to leave the station due to the martial law in the concession. Traffic Director Zheng Baozhao discussed with foreign engineer Desford, and then negotiated with the Commercial Corps Headquarters of the Concession, allowing passengers to enter the concession with the platform tickets of the railway. All the iron gate areas were guarded by teams from the International Commercial Corps.</p>

Upon receiving this, I have investigated the matter, which is unfortunate. The mayor expresses his deep regret. After receiving the report that day, considering that the case involved injury and there were clear provisions in the law, the Public Security Bureau was immediately ordered to arrest the murderers within a time limit and bring them to justice. The mayor is also willing to provide appropriate medical and consolation money to the victims to show his sympathy. As for the matter mentioned in your letter regarding the suppression of the anti-Japanese movement, it has now been found that the anti-Japanese salvation committees in various circles of the city have engaged in excessive and illegal acts. The competent authorities have been ordered to abolish the associations in order to maintain the rule of law. Regarding such excessive and illegal acts, the mayor will continue to uphold the spirit of the rule of law and order their suppression. The bureau has also been ordered to abolish other anti-Japanese groups accordingly. This letter is sent to you for your information."</p>

Therefore, I will not hesitate to sacrifice myself to seek the safety of Shanghai. Honor, disgrace, praise, or blame are of no consideration." Mayor Wu continued, saying that he did not wish to make any further comments regarding this case in the future.</p>

<p>German representatives of the Ling Tie Factory, Kang Daofu, Feilen Hao, and Xu Peide, and British representatives of the Ammonium Sulfate Factory, Sam Sheng, Allen Gibb, etc., visited National Government Committee member Kong Xiangxi at West Ains Road yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to revitalize Chinese industry. Kong specially prepared tea and refreshments. When Kong was previously the Minister of Industry and Commerce, he planned various basic industrial matters, such as sugar factories, steel factories, and ammonium sulfate factories, mostly using foreign capital, and repeatedly contacted foreign businessmen to formulate implementation methods and submit them to the central government for approval. When Kong handed over departmental affairs a few days ago, he was extremely concerned about this type of industry, as they were all very important, and asked the new Minister Chen Gongbo to pay special attention to and continue to carry them out. In addition to the draft contract for the sugar factory being signed with Cuban merchants earlier, Kang Daofu and others have now come to China, and Chen has signed a contract for the steel factory based on Kong's original draft. There is also an agreement on the ammonium sulfate factory. However, the German Kang Daofu, the Englishman Sam Sheng, and others came to China this time because of a previous agreement with Kong to visit Kong after arriving in Shanghai, so Kong specially prepared tea and refreshments yesterday to discuss all matters in detail, so that everything can proceed smoothly in the future and achieve a satisfactory outcome as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Talks on the Implementation of the Five-Year Plan in Shaanxi Province</p>
<p>Hu Yimin, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government and director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters Office in Beijing, came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency had the following conversation with him. According to him, Chairman Yang has also taken over the position of Pacification Director and has begun to work, commanding the troops stationed in Gansu and other provinces. The Sichuan Army's Huang Yin and other troops harassed the border of Shaanxi. According to recent telegrams, they are in Hanzhong (i.e., Nanzheng County in southern Shaanxi). Commander Yang has sent troops to resolve the matter. The military affairs of Gansu and Ningxia provinces have been pacified, and local rehabilitation is underway. Commander Ma (Hongkui)'s headquarters is currently stationed in the vicinity of Xuchang, Henan. Qinzhong has suffered from disasters for more than ten years, and the people are extremely poor. After the provincial government and others made every effort to reorganize it in 1931, production was richer than before. In one or two years, it can be restored to its original state. Starting in 1933, it is planned to implement a five-year plan, hoping that capitalists will invest in land reclamation and mining, which should be considerable. He came to Shanghai this time to contact China National Aviation Corporation about the Shanghai-Shaanxi air route, which runs from Shanghai via Hankou and Laohekou to Xi'an. It was previously tested, and the Shaanxi Provincial Government is willing to do its best to help promote the realization of this route.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Record of the Women's Temperance Association Meeting <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Shen Gave a Painful Speech</p>
<p>The Women's Christian Temperance Union held its sixth meeting yesterday at the YMCA and welcomed new male and female members. Among them, Ms. Shen Fugui gave a brief speech, full of anxiety and pain. She said that the rise and fall of a country depends entirely on whether its economy is sufficient. If the people buy foreign goods regardless of whether they are necessities, how can the economy of this country be sufficient? The current economic situation in our country is extremely difficult. The only way to remedy it is for our compatriots across the country to immediately implement the use of domestic goods. At this time of tense foreign aggression, there are still many unawakened intellectuals in the party, government, industry, commerce, and academic circles who continue to buy foreign goods, thinking they are beautiful and modern, not knowing that China will perish because of them. As a member of the women's community, I joined your association in the spirit of setting an example, and I am willing to do my best to publicize to the women's community in Shanghai, and I will not stop until the women compatriots across the country are aware of using domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to the Increase in Tariffs in Central Europe <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>A Telegram Is Sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Forward a Telegram to Various Envoys Abroad to Help Mediate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, stating that on the 23rd of this month, the Egg Industry Association wrote that various countries in Central Europe, such as Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria, have been discussing increasing the tax rates on various imported goods for a long time, and it seems that it will be implemented. If Chinese eggs are included, sales will be further reduced, and the national economy and people's livelihood will be even more affected. The value of our country's purchases of German goods exceeds ten times the value of Chinese goods exported. If the export of Chinese goods decreases, the ability to purchase German goods will also decrease accordingly. There is a relationship between import and export. Sino-German relations have always been close, and it is hoped that they will support each other in commerce so that both sides can benefit and maintain international friendship. Therefore, it is in the interest of both sides for the German government not to increase the future import tax on eggs. The Association believes that an early proposal should be made, and time should not be lost. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly send a telegram to the German Embassy to first seek to cancel the tax from the German government in advance, and to send telegrams to the embassies in Vienna and Prague to exempt the import tax on Chinese eggs, they are specially requesting your Association to appeal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly find a way to stop it, so as to maintain our country's egg industry's trade with Central Europe, which would be greatly appreciated by the German envoys. The Association believes that at the present time, all countries in the world are in a state of economic depression, and increasing import tariffs in the hope of self-preservation is a common policy. However, the Far East market has always been relied upon by various countries, and countries that have been financially depleted after the European War, as well as emerging countries, want to use our Chinese market to open up their sales channels, which is especially important. It is appropriate to request a reciprocal strategy. The tariff war is not suitable for the situation. The quantity of Chinese goods imported by later countries is small, and the competition is not as fierce as that of advanced countries in Europe. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of each country, there is no need to increase the import tax on Chinese goods. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can forward a telegram to various envoys abroad and help mediate the situation in a timely manner, the reversal plan is also expected. The relationship is not only about the egg industry. It seems that the argument should be based on all Chinese goods in order to be appropriate and avoid omissions. We hope that your Ministry will review and instruct. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Exemption of Business Tax for Silk Manufacturing Industry Approved <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association previously received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, forwarding a letter from the Business Tax Collection Office of the Finance Bureau, stating that silk factories are listed in the silk manufacturing industry, and the tax rate is levied according to the amount of capital. They were instructed to order the silk factories to fill out the forms and report the situation. The Chairman of the Trade Association Committee, Shen Yichen, etc., according to the provisions of Article 1 of the Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax by the Ministry, stated that the silk exported by the factory has already paid ten taels of customs duties per package, and recently increased by five taels. The industry has already borne a heavy tax burden, so how can it be taxed again for the silk manufacturing industry? They repeatedly argued and requested an exemption from the tax. It is now learned that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has received instructions from the Municipal Government that the request for exemption from the silk manufacturing industry's business tax is in line with Item 4 of the reduction and exemption measures and should be approved. In addition to reporting to the Ministry for review and filing, they were ordered to notify them accordingly. The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association has already received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, forwarding a letter from the Finance Bureau, requesting notification, and immediately recorded the letter and notified all members to check it.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Min People in Shanghai Are Enthusiastic About Hometown Autonomy <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>Fujian people in Shanghai and Beijing recently initiated the organization of the Fujian Local Autonomy Promotion Association to promote autonomy in their hometown. At 2:00 PM on the 27th, the inaugural meeting was held on the 5th floor of No. 141 Tianbao Road. Qiu Hanping was elected as chairman, and Pan Zuomin as secretary. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting. The members expressed their opinions, all believing that saving the hometown and saving the country should start with the development of civil rights in local autonomy. The association should be established in Shanghai, and after a considerable period of time, they will return to the province to work. Then, the simple rules and declarations were discussed and revised and passed. Then, temporary staff members were elected, including 11 directors: Li Yue, Qin Wangshan, Qiu Hanping, Ge Yuexi, Xu Hongkun, Pan Zuomin, Hong Guoxuan, Guo Zhaolin, Wu Yuwen, Gao Chongling, Yang Qingxuan; 5 alternate directors: Liang Longguang, Liu Zunguang, Chen Yaokun, Li Deguang, Lu Mengqing; 5 supervisors: Zhang Chuming, Huang Chengyuan, Yang Jun, Qiu Zansheng, Qiu Ruiqu; 2 alternate supervisors: Chen Jizhi, Li Gongchen; and designated the directors Qiu Hanping, Pan Zuomin, Hong Guoxuan, Guo Zhaolin, and Wu Yuwen, who are permanently in Shanghai, as standing directors, and Zhang Chuming, Qiu Zansheng, and Qiu Ruiqu as standing supervisors, and planned to send members to various counties in the province to organize branches to promote autonomy matters nearby. Now, the association's declaration is recorded as follows: The locality is the foundation of the country, and autonomy is the ladder of constitutionalism. Therefore, those who govern the country well must implement local autonomy so that the people can devote themselves to the public undertakings of the locality, thereby increasing their ability to handle public affairs, and then they can participate in national affairs, supervise the government, and advance the country into the ranks of constitutionalism, and bring all the people into the realm of freedom. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, advocated the Three Principles of the People, and also regarded local autonomy as an essential means of training the people to exercise the four rights of election, initiation, referendum, and recall, and to assist in the formation of national politics. Therefore, the General Outline of National Construction and the Law on the Implementation of Local Autonomy clearly stipulate that the county is the unit of autonomy, and the county constitution, the provincial constitution, and the national constitution are established. Unfortunately, the legacy has been passed down, but it has not been implemented effectively. Although the rules have been established, they have not been promoted, which has made it impossible for civil rights to develop and politics has not been clear. Now, the government and the public know that without developing democracy, there is no way to ensure domestic peace and resist foreign aggression. Local autonomy urgently needs to be developed. People born in Fujian, Weisan and Zi, dare not forget to be respectful. Therefore, they organize the Fujian Local Autonomy Promotion Association, with a sincere heart, and together with their elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots, maintain local peace and strive for autonomy, such as household registration surveys, land surveys, bandit elimination, Baojia implementation, road construction, agricultural promotion, educational popularization, and the use of four rights, will do their best to achieve results, so that local autonomous organizations become economic and political organizations to achieve the goals of civil rights and people's livelihood. Then, the mission of the association will be completed. This matter is of great importance and should rely on the strength of the people. It is hoped that the elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots in the province and living overseas will actively participate and fight together, so that local autonomy in Fujian counties and cities can achieve good results, and the provincial constitution can promote the national constitution. Then, the country and the hometown will be fortunate. Respectfully, we declare this.</p>

<p>Dry rice seeds come from Changchun and are planted like wheat. They are sown during Qingming and can be harvested in three months. Each mu can yield more than one dan of rice. Its properties are similar to glutinous rice, but it is not sticky. Last year, someone bought one dou of dry rice seeds from Harbin and sowed them in Xishan, Dongting, Wu County, in the spring of 1931 for trial planting. As a result, the rice heads were also four inches long, no different from those planted in the field, and the harvest was also abundant. During this period of disaster, the authorities and experts in agriculture and land reclamation should urgently find ways to promote it.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Chinese Medicine Industry Held an Extraordinary Meeting <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Denying Peony Bark Monopoly Market Price</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association convened an extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss the case of the Chinese medicine industry opposing the monopoly of peony bark market prices. Twelve executive committee members attended, and Yongtai Fu, Heli Yuan, Yicheng, and Licheng sent representatives. President Zhan Tinghua reported on the letter from the Chinese Medicine Industry Association. After discussion, it was agreed that industry members act as agents to buy and sell for customers and cannot force mountain merchants to limit sales to certain companies, and there is no monopoly or manipulation. As for the high and low prices, the quality varies, and it is not unique to one place. The mountain merchants of this peony bark are unwilling to reduce prices and are allowed to return the original goods. The original letter to the Chinese Medicine Association stated: On the 26th of this month, it was approved that the letter No. 1 from your association opened by opposing Yongtai Fu and others' exclusive sales of peony bark, unauthorized raising of wholesale prices, and monopolizing and manipulating the market. The meeting resolved to use the Hangzhou market as the standard and stated that this Association has the responsibility to correct the ills of the industry. If we do not correct and restrain, we will request a reply from you. In light of this, Yongtai Fu and others are marketing peony bark, which is sold by mountain merchants. Mountain merchants come to Shanghai to handle goods and are willing to sell to whichever company and at whatever price they choose. It is a matter of business freedom for the mountain merchants. Industry members only have the right to buy or not buy and cannot force them to limit sales. The previous advertisement was posted by the mountain merchants and has nothing to do with industry members. Your association's letter wrongly accused Yongtai Fu and others of monopolizing and manipulating because they are acting as agents. It is too much to protect them. Correcting the ills of the industry is indeed the responsibility of this Association. If the medicine of industry members is mixed with fake medicine, endangering the lives of patients, this Association will sanction them. Now, Yongtai Fu and others are selling on behalf of customers. What are the ills and harms? Your association actually questioned and blamed the agents, Yongtai Fu and others, based on one-sided words, and rashly revealed this in the newspaper. Although it is a news report, it was also instructed by your association. Such wanton accusations are not appropriate for your close association. Your association should remedy and correct this in order to maintain good relations. Compared with your industry, the interest rate on pharmaceuticals is vastly different. Should your association's claim that the "increase in the burden on the poor and sick" be held accountable? On the 27th of this month, this Association convened Yongtai Fu and others to discuss this matter. It was agreed that the price of goods varies depending on quality, and it is impossible for prices to be the same in each place, and it is not unique to the pharmaceutical industry. The mountain merchants firmly refused to reduce the original price of peony bark. If the Chinese medicine industry thinks the price is not suitable, they can return the original goods. The letter has been approved and should be forwarded to your association for reference, and it is hoped that it will be forwarded to them accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e92">A Threatening Message for Borrowing Feet P] Gu Apei's Extreme Boredom Zhang Ading, a native of Wuxi, residing at No. 6, Junhe Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, has a younger sister named Zhang A'mei, who is 27 years old and unmarried. Gu Apei, who once lived with them, repeatedly harassed her with lewd intentions. Zhang discovered this and drove Gu out. After Gu moved out, he held a grudge and wrote a threatening letter to the Zhang siblings a few days ago, making wanton threats and claiming he wanted to "borrow a foot" for his use. Zhang then filed a complaint with the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. Gu was arrested and taken to the local court yesterday for interrogation and handling. The Municipal First Public Cemetery Project to Be Completed Around Qingming Festival Last summer and autumn, the Shanghai Municipal Government purchased over 200 mu of land near the Jiangwan Gaojing Temple Station on Songhu Road, west side, to build the Municipal First Public Cemetery Base to facilitate the burial needs of citizens. Soon after, the municipal government ordered the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to invite bids, and a construction contractor undertook the construction. After half a year, the construction project is mostly completed. Today, passengers on Songhu Road can catch a glimpse of the Municipal First Public Cemetery's tomb base, archway, auditorium, and other buildings when passing Gaojing Temple. The cemetery project is still underway recently and is expected to be completed before the Qingming Festival. By then, the Municipal Health Bureau will take over the tomb base and prepare for citizens to claim land for burial. It is said that each tomb will occupy approximately 10 cubic feet of land. The municipal government will select a suitable location within the city after this project is completed to purchase land for building public graves. The Abducted Child Sent Back from Fujian, the Abductors Awaiting Sentencing Wu Zhangshi, a native of Anhui living at No. 15, Xialin Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, has a six-year-old daughter, A'er, who often visited her maternal grandparents' home at No. 137 Zhengjia Muqiao Street, across the lane, and sometimes played with A'yin, the fourteen-year-old daughter of Zhang Chenshi, a woman from Luodian who lived upstairs in her maternal grandparents' home. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month at 2:00 PM, A'er was suddenly abducted by Li Jiarong, Zhang Chenshi's paramour, in collusion with Deng Fenglin, a fellow villager from Shandong, along with Chenshi's daughter A'yin, to Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. Through the introduction of Zhang's wife, she was sold to Lin Wangshi, a Fujian woman, and sent to the Jing'an warship moored there. At that time, A'yin was sent back because of her crying, but A'er was taken to Fujian. After Wu Zhangshi found out, she reported it to the French police. Detective Hang Guangfu arrested Deng and the related Fujian women, Wang Linshi and Tang Wangshi. Li Jiarong and Zhang's wife had already fled upon hearing the news. The Jing'an warship had already sailed to Fujian, making it impossible to retrieve the child. Deng and others were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Zhang Chenshi and her daughter Zhang A'yin were deemed to have known about the incident but did not report it, raising suspicions of collusion, and were ordered to post bail pending further investigation. The above information has been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the French police notified the local Naval Headquarters at the time, requesting them to telegraph the Fujian authorities to intercept the child. The headquarters complied and telegraphed the Fuzhou authorities. When the Jing'an warship entered the port, the child was found, and Lin Wangshi was arrested and transferred to Shanghai, handed over to the Naval Headquarters, and then to the French police for interrogation. Yesterday, the police sent the suspects in this case to the court for questioning. First, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, presented the case and prosecuted according to Article 258 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Lin Wangshi confessed to buying A'er for 60 yuan to be her daughter. Deng Fenglin confessed that he was instigated by Li Jiarong, who was at large, to abduct his paramour's daughter A'yin first, but she refused, so he abducted the Wu family's daughter. Zhang Chenshi confessed that she learned about the abduction of the Wu family's child from her daughter and entrusted someone to report it to the Public Security Bureau the next day to arrest Deng, denying any collusion. The judge verified the confessions, announced the conclusion of the trial, and scheduled the sentencing for January 30th. The defendants were remanded in custody, and Zhang Chenshi and her daughter were detained for further instructions due to strong suspicions. The girl was first released to her family.

Tianyi Sound Film Company Greatly Expands Tianyi Film Company has a growing reputation. Now, to specialize in the production of sound films, it has been reorganized and expanded by prominent figures from the business communities of China, Britain, the United States, and France in Shanghai. Shanghai has long been known as the "Paris of the East," and now that the company is dedicating its efforts to the highest quality Chinese sound film industry, it is not far from earning the reputation of "Hollywood of the East." The company aims to produce a variety of high-quality Chinese sound films to be supplied to theaters in Shanghai and other cities. It is said that the former Tianyi Film Company's studios and other facilities are planned to be owned by the new company, and the latest sound film equipment will be installed soon so that its achievements can be the first in the East and compare favorably with Hollywood. American sound experts have also been hired to assist Chinese directors. The recently released films "Songstress's Spring" and "The Last Love" have already been popular. Future productions are expected to be even better. An Unidentified Male Corpse Found Dead on Gonghe Xin Road Yesterday around 3:00 PM, an unidentified male corpse was suddenly found dead at the entrance of Yideli on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei. He was about 40 years old, wearing a tattered yellow military coat, a blue cloth cotton-padded jacket underneath, black cotton pants, and a melon-rind cap. The guard on duty at the scene investigated and reported it to Chief Chen Maoxiu, who then reported it to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. He also instructed Wang Shaoting, the local security officer of Jin'ertu, to report to the Shanghai Local Court to request an autopsy. Weather Report Xujiahui Observatory's Weather Forecast at 4:30 PM Yesterday: The Yangtze River Basin and the local seas have uncertain weather, with both sunny and rainy conditions. There is a cyclone in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which is moving northeast due to the passage of a low-pressure system. There are fresh winds of uncertain direction over the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 52.0 degrees, and the lowest was 30.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 35.6 degrees, and the lowest was 24.4 degrees. Reader's Correspondence The Rope-Making Factory's Practices Making straw ropes was originally a handicraft and a sideline for farming families. For more than a decade, someone invented machine-made ropes, which led to a larger scale and greater output. In addition to being sold in Shanghai, as much as 10 million catties are sold to Japan each year, reportedly purchased by people in the egg industry there. This is something that Chinese people don't usually pay attention to, but it has the potential for export. There are more than 30 rope-making factories in Shanghai, with a trade association located in Fangbang Bridge. The first ones to open were Dong Fengji and Xie Ji. Larger ones include Li Da, Heng Kang, Xie Ji, Long Xiang, and Xinhua. Their addresses are mostly in Pudong and Gaochang Temple, Xie Xu Road, and Shi Qigang. The raw material for rope-making is only rice straw, mostly from Songjiang, with a market price of over one yuan per dan. Ropes are measured by the coil, with each coil weighing 12-13 catties or 15-16 catties, valued at four jiao or less. There are several grades of ropes, from third to seventh. The first and second grades are too thin and cannot bear weight, so they are not sold or made. The rope-making process is very simple: first, the straw is sorted to make it uniform in length, and then it is divided into strands of seven or eight or four or five. People twist the strands with a rope-making machine, which is operated by foot. There are horn-shaped tubes on the left and right, into which the straw is fed continuously. The single strands are twisted into double strands, and then the double strands are transferred to a circular iron frame inside the machine. By stepping on the machine and feeding the straw, 20 coils of rope can be twisted each day. The labor cost is 500 wen per dan of rope. The best rope-making machines are made by the Huang Detai Machinery Factory north of the Shanghai South City Guild Hall, with a price of 20 yuan per machine. The rice straw husks are soaked in lime water to rot them and used to make grass paper (i.e., the paper used by plasterers). This is a byproduct of the rope-making factory. Some people also use it as fuel, which is not very economical.

<p>Educational News Important News The Ministry of Education Further Explains the Issue of Educational Associations, Designating the Anhui Provincial Department of Education to Explain Three Points The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Anhui Provincial Department of Education regarding three points raised by the Xuyi County Educational Association requesting clarification on the issue of educational associations, instructed the department as follows: "Received the report. The requested clarifications are answered separately as follows: (1) According to the provisions of Article 14 of the Implementing Regulations of the Educational Association Law, alternate directors may attend directors' meetings, but cannot fill in for absent directors on a temporary basis; (2) If a director takes a long-term leave of absence, they should be asked to resign in accordance with the provisions of Article 25, Section 2 of the Educational Association Law, and the alternate directors should fill in sequentially; (3) When calculating the quorum for directors' meetings, only the attending directors should be counted, and alternate directors should not be included. Please take note and instruct compliance." Statistics on Departments in Private Universities The Ministry of Education's statistics up to December of the 20th year show that the following private universities and colleges have been registered, including the names of the colleges (or departments) they have established and their locations: Xiamen University: Arts, Science, Law, Education, Commerce, Xiamen Jinling University: Arts, Science, Agriculture, Nanjing Datong University: Arts, Science, Commerce, Shanghai Fudan University: Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, Shanghai Shanghai University: Arts, Science, Education, Commerce, Shanghai Guanghua University: Arts, Science, Commerce, Shanghai Daxia University: Arts, Science, Law, Education, Commerce, Shanghai Yenching University: Arts, Science, Law, Beijing Nankai University: Arts, Science, Commerce, Tianjin Soochow University: Arts, Science, Law, Suzhou Shanghai Wuchang China University: Arts, Science, Commerce, Wuchang Peking Union Medical College: Medicine, Beijing China Institute: Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, Shanghai Shanghai College of Law and Politics: Law, Shanghai Lingnan University: Arts, Science, Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, Guangzhou Nantong College: Agriculture, Medicine, Textile, Nantong China College: Arts, Law, Beijing Chaoyang College: Law, Beijing Ginling College for Women: Arts, Science, Nanjing Shanghai College of Law: Law, Shanghai Fukien Christian University: Arts, Science, Fuzhou National Kwangtung University: Arts, Law, Industry, Commerce, Guangzhou Chekiang College: Arts, Science, Hangzhou Chih Tze College: Arts, Law, Shanghai Fu Jen University: Arts, Science, Education, Beijing Republic College: Arts, Law, Beijing North China College: Arts, Law, Beijing Sino-French University: Arts, Science, Medicine, Social Sciences, Beijing Cheeloo University: Arts, Science, Medicine, Jinan Central China College: Arts, Science, Education, Wuchang Xiangya Medical College: Medicine, Changsha Mediation of the Soochow University Incident The Soochow University Shanghai Alumni Association's Letter to Students Remaining at the School The letter states: "To the students: Since the patriotic movement at the School of Arts and Sciences and Soochow Academy has caused turmoil, we have been deeply concerned. Therefore, after the incident occurred, our association sent staff to Suzhou to investigate the truth. On the 22nd of this month, an emergency meeting was convened at the Shanghai YMCA to report on the investigation in Suzhou. After a long discussion, we unanimously agreed that maintaining the school's discipline is the first priority. At the same time, the members of our association are willing to mediate from a third-party perspective and have elected Cheng Renjie, Dong Chengdao, Bei Songsun, Chen Tingrui, and Qian Baohe as representatives to proceed accordingly. We deeply sympathize with the patriotic movement of the students of our school. However, due to the patriotic movement, it has exceeded the norms, affecting studies, damaging school discipline, and causing educational bankruptcy, resulting in irreparable losses to the country. This is contrary to the original intention of saving the country, which we believe is beyond what you all initially expected. As for the school authorities' hasty actions, the measures taken may not be entirely satisfactory. However, in order to maintain school discipline, they have their own difficulties. If we were in their position, we might not have other options. On the student side, after thorough investigation, they declared the expulsion of President Yang, surrounded the faculty, organized a picket team, and restricted students' freedom, making it impossible for the school authorities to exercise their powers. As a result, the solemn academy has fallen into a state of emergency for two weeks, which we cannot agree with. The maintenance of school discipline is related to the students' character and is also the basis of the nation. If the principles are lost, how can the country stand? You all understand this very well, so we don't need to say more. Therefore, we confirm that the prerequisite for resolving this turmoil is to restore the original state of the school administration as soon as possible. Fortunately, according to the report from our association's investigator in Suzhou, the students remaining at the school no longer oppose President Yang. At the same time, the remaining students should cancel the organization of the picket team and the restrictions on students' freedom. Then, we can sincerely cooperate with each other, taking patriotism as the prerequisite. If the students in the school have any opinions on the patriotic movement, we, as members of the alumni, are willing to convey them on their behalf to achieve satisfactory results and prevent the glorious history of our school for more than 30 years from collapsing in one morning. This is what we sincerely pray for. We hope you will consider our humble opinions." Zhang Yiqing and Others' Declaration of Mediation Zhang Yiqing and others' declaration of mediation for Soochow University states: "Our highest institution of learning, Soochow University, has suddenly been known for student unrest. It is inevitable that differences in thoughts and tendencies of the patriotic movement will lead to discord due to misunderstandings and result in pathological conditions. However, at a time when the whole country is advocating peaceful unification and national solidarity, it is even more heartbreaking that the intellectual class, which is influenced by American culture, cannot practice it themselves first. We cannot bear to see this highest institution of learning in a state of standstill, unable to rely on the guidance of faculty and unable to hope for a change in the board of trustees. Therefore, we cannot help but step forward to maintain it together. The main point is that teachers and students should trust each other with sincerity, not act on emotions; the school should focus on redemption, not make suspension of classes the norm. We, who were either former faculty members, friends of the parents, or have student qualifications, have been studying for many years and have a deep understanding of the school. We are not seeking a quick solution, but hoping to build a foundation for long-term peace. We sincerely declare the following:" (1) Yang Guangshan has served for six years and has maintained the educational affairs with diligence. We hope that the students will not demand his dismissal due to emotional bias. If President Yang volunteers to resign, the board of trustees can select a successor, so that the current president can resign with dignity and not be dismissed by the students. (2) Private schools should not be easily suspended. If the board of trustees can handle the matter, it should be handed over to them for management. However, the Ministry of Education's Central University has not yet found a solution, so we hope that the Ministry of Education will take it back or the Ministry of Education will solve it themselves. We hope that the faculty will encourage the students to choose a date for resuming classes and maintain the status quo. (3) Student representatives have not yet succeeded in anything. The public opinion of the students should be sought, not just one person's private opinion. We should ask the school administration to show leniency and allow Zhu Sheng to stay and observe, but if Zhu Sheng voluntarily wants to transfer to another school, he should be allowed to do so, but the representatives should be thoroughly investigated to avoid being targeted. (The school only has a text message to notify parents to take them back, but no explicit statement of withdrawal, so the school seems to have no problems.) (4) The above points should be notified separately by the members of the mediation committee to the president, the school administration, the board of trustees, and the student union. If they agree, a date should be chosen for resuming classes. Zhang Yichen, Li Genyuan, Zhang Binglin, Liu Zhan Si, Yu Rizhang, Jin Tianyu.

After the meeting, all the representatives went to the Municipal Government. When passing the Xiaomiaoqiao intersection, they were stopped by more than 30 armed police officers due to martial law. At that time, the representatives, filled with righteous indignation, cried and explained their intentions to the police, asking for passage. Many of the police officers were moved and reported to Secretary Guan of the Municipal Government, who approved the dispatch of two representatives to the Municipal Government.

<h3 id="e94">Private Counterfeit Money Printing Operation Cracked on New Zha Road <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Counterfeit Money and Opium Seized</p>
<p>Three Male and Female Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Bao Detective Li Baichuan of the General Inspectorate learned that someone had established a private counterfeit currency printing operation inside No. 48 Hongxiang Lane, New Zha Road, secretly printing various bank notes for sale and mixing them into circulation in the market, disrupting the financial system. He reported this to the head detective, and at 6:30 a.m. the day before, he, together with Western Detective Turner, Chinese Detective Wu Chunrong, Bao Detective Li Jincheng, and others, secretly went to the address to make arrests. Upon arriving at Hongxiang Lane, they saw that the house was a two-story building. The ground floor was a tailoring shop. The Chinese and Western detectives went straight to the second floor, where they found a woman named Cao Zhengshi from Anhui, sound asleep in bed. She was suddenly awakened and, upon seeing the detectives, immediately took out two ten-yuan banknotes from beside her and tore them up, intending to discard them. She was arrested by the detectives, and the torn pieces of paper were recovered. A search was then commenced, but nothing was found. The detectives then proceeded to the front room of the second floor, which was occupied by Liang Defu from Xuzhou and his wife, Liang Liushi. Under the mattress of their bed, the detectives found ninety-six five-yuan counterfeit banknotes, twelve ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes, and one pound of opium. The Liang couple were arrested. Then, in the back shed, a large amount of counterfeit money was found in a box, including one thousand four hundred and forty-nine ten-yuan banknotes, two thousand seven hundred and fifty five-yuan banknotes, and sixty-nine Sichuan Chongqing grain deed tax stamps. A printing press, a rolling pin, a basket of various chemicals, an electric motor, nineteen cans of printing ink, and other parts were also seized and taken to the New Zha Road Police Station. The head detective ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. Presiding Judge Zhou Hanting and Prosecutor Qian Hongye came to the court for the trial. The Shanghai Municipal Council was represented by lawyer Ru Baozhen, who appeared in court to prosecute. The defendant, Cao Zhengshi, hired lawyer Fan to defend her. Lawyer Ru then rose and detailed the circumstances of the cracking of the case, stating that the first defendant was being prosecuted under Article 211 of the Criminal Law for counterfeiting currency, and that the Liang Defu couple were also being charged with possession of opium under Article 13 of the Opium Prohibition Law. It was found that the main culprit in the case was Cao Zhengshi's husband, Cao Liangui, who is currently at large. However, Cao Zhengshi and Liang Defu had previously been arrested by the General Inspectorate on November 2, 1926, for counterfeiting currency and sent to the former Mixed Court for punishment. Now, they have been arrested again for the same crime, which should be noted. Moreover, the operation that has been cracked is an important counterfeit money operation, and the police urgently need to conduct a thorough investigation. Therefore, he requested a postponement for further questioning and presented the seized items to the court. Because the machines and other items were all made of iron, they were extremely heavy and cumbersome. Although they had been transported to the outside of the court by a large car, it was impossible to bring them into the courtroom. Subsequently, representatives from the banks filed a case, proving that the banknotes seized by the police were all counterfeit. When questioned, the two defendants, Zheng Caoshi and others, gave evasive answers and denied manufacturing them. After Judge Zhou reviewed the confessions, he ordered them to be remanded to custody separately and postponed the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Pan Baisan, Female Instructor at Datong University, Feared to Have Drowned Herself <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Sudden Weariness of the World Upon Returning from Guangdong</p>
<p>Wrote to Friends Distributing Luggage</p>
<p>Pan Baisan, a former female instructor at Datong University, was from Hunan, around thirty years old, and of an upright character. She served at Datong University for a year and a half, diligently performing her duties and was trusted by the president and her colleagues. On one occasion, she had a slight verbal conflict with Director Yu of the School's Social Education Department regarding her duties and immediately submitted her resignation. However, after repeated requests from the school authorities to stay, she returned to the school in the autumn of 1931. Due to the difficulty of her work, she had no choice but to resign again and went to work in a government agency in Guangdong. Unexpectedly, last week, Ms. Pan suddenly sent a letter to her fellow townsman, Mr. Wang Nansheng, at the school, generally saying that a sense of weariness of the world had suddenly arisen in her, and when the ship arrived in Shanghai, she asked that her luggage be distributed to everyone as a memento. After searching for her whereabouts in various places, there has been no sign of her, and it is feared that she has drowned herself. The details of her weariness of the world have not yet been fully revealed.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Sheng Family Nephews’ Inheritance Dispute Case <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded, Awaiting Verdict</p>
<p>Zhuang Tai-furen, wife of Sheng Xuanhuai, former Palace Guardian of the Qing Dynasty, passed away in 1927. Recently, grandsons Lin Fengwen and Lin Fengjun hired lawyers to criminally accuse their maternal uncles Sheng Zecheng, Banchen, Pinchen, Yu Chang, Yu You, and their maternal aunts Guan Yi, Fang Yi, Jing Yi, and six other people of embezzling tens of thousands of dollars of their late mother Xiao Yi's due share of the property. The case was previously investigated by Judge Shen Shumu at the First Special District Court, who ordered the plaintiffs to submit evidence for further review. The day before yesterday, the hearing continued. The plaintiff Lin Fengwen was present in court, and all the defendants were present except for Sheng Banchen, who was unable to attend due to being out of town. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, his maternal aunt had written a letter to Lin Fengwen, detailing her willingness to provide him with 14,000 yuan for his wedding expenses and asking Lin not to litigate, thereby indicating that his mother, Ms. Lin, was entitled to a share of Zhuang Tai-furen's estate as inheritance. He presented the letter as conclusive proof. When questioned, the defendants claimed that they were only allocated at most 70,000 yuan and at least 10,000 yuan each, according to their mother's will. The amount accused by the plaintiff was vastly different. The defendants' lawyer submitted a petition counter-suing the plaintiff for false accusation and fabrication of embezzlement. Moreover, the plaintiff's mother passed away during the more than twenty years of the Guangxu reign in the late Qing Dynasty. The provision for daughters to inherit their parents' property only began in 1927. Therefore, the plaintiff's request is invalid. Lin's lawyer argued that the plaintiff now has two brothers, who are the biological sons of Lin Shengshi, and their right to inherit property cannot be invalidated. The amount of inheritance received by the defendants, as claimed by them, totaled only over 100,000 yuan, which is inconsistent with the fact that the first defendant, Sheng Zecheng, admitted to having over 800,000 yuan, which clearly indicates that they themselves have committed embezzlement. He asked the court to be discerning. Judge Shen declared that the debate in the case was concluded and that a verdict would be announced at a scheduled time.</p>
