<p>丨丨蘇美之態度與中國自救之道丨丨</p>
<p>國聯之虚僞。英法之情勢。已如昨論。今再言蘇美與我之關係。俄與我接壤。亘數萬里。自大彼得帝以來。即積極努力於在東方求得一不凍港口。以此而引起與日利益衝突之日俄大戰革命以後。對我東北仍未嘗放鬆。覇佔烏蘇里江之航權。操縱外蒙古之政治經濟。故意使中蘇會議陷於停頓。即其例證。近年全國上下努力於五年計劃之實行。利用世界資本主義者之資本。開發其國内之富源。增加生產。復以產品傾銷於世界之市塲。對内緊縮。對外「探拼。」使世界經濟競爭之塲合。有蘇聯之立足點。並進而制世界資本主義之死命惟以全力發展經濟。穏固其基礎目不旁鶩在外交方面。則極力拆散反蘇聯之聯合戰綫。務求避免與資本主義國際之正面衝突。故東北禍變發生。僅從宣傳上譏刺國聯之無能。暴露帝國主義之虚僞。並鼓吹各國共產黨。從事「變換國際戰爭爲國内戰爭」之工作。而不能予我以實力上之援助。蓋蘇聯深知日佔我東北。固爲發揮其帝國主義之野心。而其最大之意義。則尤在於在太平洋形成反蘇聯之聯合戰綫。欲一舉而倍覆社會主義國家之根基也。</p>
<p>美與歐陸較。爲新興之資本主義國家。持實利主義爲立國之大計。對美洲則抱門羅主義。對世界則主門户開放。蓋列强在。華皆有勢力圏。而美尙無之。故不得不以機會均等爲口號。以約章爲手段。牽制列强。維持均勢。美之金圓勢力。灌輪世界無孔不入。我國本爲外貨最好之銷納塲。祇以連年内戰。國敝民困。又以日本之大陸政策。有進無已。其對華投資。直灌注入長江流域。美之進展。每爲所限。日美在太平洋之逐鹿。識者早以二次大戰爲憂。惟美在歐之投資。遠在中國之上。在華投資。僅合在德一國投資百分之十。且其對日貿易與對華貿易。無論進口出口。幾都等於二與一之比。因是日美之間雖有裂痕。而在利害上尙難破臉。故美初以國聯爲第一道防線。送秋波於日内瓦。藉輕卸責任於國聯。繼復以道威斯周旋於巴黎。又向日本重送欵曲其心事已暴露無遺至我棄錦州之守撤灤河之師美於是知第一道防綫。已不能守。乃急提九國公約非戰公約之照會。爲對日第二道防綫之招架。殊不知日本早已看透美國之技倆。日人細野繫勝且早已譏此爲「認識差誤之對華政策。」東北問題中。日美之關係鈎心鬥角。如斯而已。</p>
<p>英儒蒲　士曰。「若一地爲野蠻之民族。或半文明之民族所居。而其地又極富於天然之富源者。則其地當爲各國競爭之端。今我東北淪亡内亂日亟。外人屢譏我野蠻民族。而幾使我無以自解。日本近且在國際上公然宣傳。謂中國絶非「現代的國家。」倘我全國上下。再不迅速覺悟。趕緊團結奮鬥。則我國際地位。眞將喪失無餘矣。列國國難當前。每有聯合内閣之組織。我國則一黨之内。意見分歧。而新組之政府又未能决定一切實辦法。美照會到後。除以一紙表示接受而外。自己絶未有所主張。夫欲保全領土之完整應惟己力之是視。若徒賴第三者之聲援而自已無眞實力量之表現。則將置我全民族之人格於何地。今東北義勇軍已崛起於錦西。肉搏掙扎。敵膽爲寒。當局尙欲以民族存亡爲己責者。其忍視我東北義士彈蓋援絶而不顧乎。新外長陳友仁之宣言。仍欲「以外交手段消滅戰禍。」嗚呼。其可能耶。國難緊急中之外交無他法。惟有拚死肉摶而已。</p>

<p>距今四十九年前。時爲一八八二年三月二十四日。有德國醫聖考克博士。ＤＲ，ＲＯＢＥＲＴＫＯＣＨ在德京柏林之生理學大會席上。發表醫學上極有價値之一論文。題爲「肺結核之原因」博士所報告之宗旨。謂肺結核（即肺癆病）係一種特殊之傳染病。並非遺傳症且歷舉種種之實例以證明之。（如肺結絯菌之培養。染色。及動物試騐等）自此上下三千載以來之肺癆研究史上。闢一特殊之異彩。而肺癆之病原體旣明。於診斷肺癆病遂得一確切之標準矣。按肺結核菌爲顯微鏡的微菌。其形體　極小極微。設秤其一「格蘭姆」計之。爲數當在三百五十禺萬個以上。其繁殖力極爲可驚。破壞人體組織。成最可怖之結核病症。此項病菌。如排出於人體之外。則完全不能繁殖。差能僅保持其生存而已。然一旦使有侵入人體之機會。則盤據嬌嫩之肺臟。據爲大本營。肆縱其可怕之勢力。嗚呼。人類之大敵。誠莫過於肺癆病。可不懼哉。</p>
<h3 id="c65">肺結核菌之構造 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>歷來一般之醫家。因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性構造。以爲凡爲病菌。盡可以消毒之藥劑。用内服或注射之方法撲滅之。一如「六零六」之注射於梅毒也。自柏格爾博士ＤＲ。ＢＦＲＧＥＬＬ苦心研究後。始發表肺結核有一種特殊之防禦力。爲抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊。　肺結核菌體。係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜權成。若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪性之武裝。則無由俘擒結核菌而置之死地。且結核菌。侵入人體局部時。其四週即被蝕。而形成頑强之結節。以阻碍而流之通過。致使注射或内服之一般消毒藥劑。無由越雷池一步。宛如特别戒嚴之禁區。藥力旣無從接觸患部。則雖溺沉全身於藥池中。亦不能傷結核菌之毫髮。是故撲滅肺結核菌之唯一作戰方略，至少必須具下列之兩種先决條件。</p>
<p>（一）凡藥能破壞結節。而直達患部者。</p>
<p>（二）又能剥奪或溶解其蠟質及脂肪性之内外膜者。</p>
<p>如此。始能奏破關斬將之功。否則　靴搔癢。彼結核菌。且在此兩種保障之下。竊笑人之莫余害也。</p>

<p>自考克博士。發見結核菌爲肺結核症（即肺癆）之病原體以來。東西結核學者爭先研究。欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果。盡歸失敗。蓋因彼等。不知結核菌能分泌一種蠟質　包圍其本體。以禦外力侵入之深奥學理故也。曾有哈莫塞哈黎氏等發見應用百分之五至十之苛加里液。而得除去結核菌之抗酸性蠟質。後有莫純氏。應用鹽素瓦斯。而亦得除去抗酸性蠟質。然此種脫蠟法。祗能適用於顯微鏡檢查上染色法而已。蓋其藥性劇毒。對於人體。終不能實用也。</p>
<p>近數年來。偶有將大楓子油。應用於痲瘋症。而獲意外之奏效者蓋蔴瘋菌。與肺結核菌爲同性質之抗酸菌。而大楓子油。能有脫蠟之作用。兼具石炭醉用倍以上之殺菌力。於是一般學者。遂引起熱狂的　意試以大楓子油。應　於結核症患者。冀圖奏效。而用種之化學的方法。提出大楓子油之主要成分。試用於結核症患者。亦期得相當之效果。然祗限於皮膚</p>
<p>及表在性結核症。能奏良效。面對於深部的臘器。如肺靡。　　肝臟腎臟等結核。則仍不能奏何等之效果。</p>
<p>因此。我普天下結核病者之大恩師。柏格爾博士。百尺竿頭再進一步。搜集動礦特性之各種藥物。而苦心研究。期得一種有脫蠟作用。而藥性和平無毒者孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。瀝盡幾許心血。心求最合理最有效之化學劑不已。終發見特殊動物之腸間膜腺壓縮汁中某一種有效成分。對於結核菌。有强力脫蠟之作用。乃即將此新成分。作用於結核菌。則其結果。完全脫蠟。自此音日東西各醫家。所視爲人工不能除去結核菌抗酸性之主張。完全推翻。誠前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核治療之新曙光也。</p>
<h3 id="c68">肺結核之化學療法 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆之原因是結核菌。而此菌一入人體内。則於該處。便成結節。以斷血行之路。又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質。包圍其體。以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入。故雖用種種殺菌藥。内服或注射。終不能達其病菌之實體内。歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法。對症療法。理學的療法。血淸療法。藥劑療法。及其他一切治療法等尙未完全成功。而肺病無藥之說。。遍滿於一世者。因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者根據上述之學理。繼續研究。不遺餘力。結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑。名日三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國者克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟衛發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者。據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告。此藥有渗透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟之作用。兼具有殺菌力。能根治一三三期之肺癆。確有萬試　之特效在中國。業經國民政府中央衛生試騐所化騐。藥性和平無毒可絶無任何副作用。茲略舉醫治作用於下。</p>
<p>（一）設於試騐管中實騐「三部星」之藥力作用。則一分鐘後結核菌皆消失其抗酸性至三分鐘後。則此肺結核菌。完全殺盡無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐。則發見「三部星」能渗入結核病竈内。設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌。則盡失其抗酸性。此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三部星」星期左右。則立見咯痰稀釋。體熱下降等良好狀態。</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三部星」達三十天至六十天以上。則顯見體重增加。食慾激進。一切症狀。逐漸緩和。終達其回天再造之偉功。</p>

<h3 id="c127">創造中之中華民族 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>中華民族本來没有創造成功。在現代中國人的手裏掌握着創造中華民族之使命。</p>
<p>一個民族之造成似乎是要經過三個階段：</p>
<p>第一個階段各部落各自爲謀</p>
<p>第三個階段各部落互相援助</p>
<p>第三個階段各部落打成一片站在一個戰線上對付一個公敵</p>
<p>外患之來是一個民族的惟一的試金石。如果我們要知道一個民族已否創造成功，只消在外患壓來的時候看它有什麽反應，便能一目了然。</p>
<p>現代的中華民族已經創造到那一個階段？是進化還是退化？依我的觀察，中華民族是已經創造到第二個階叚，倘無軍閥的阻礙，立刻可以跳到第三個階段。</p>
<p>明朝亡國之時，中華民族大多數還是逗遛在第一個階段。北京失陷，南京旁觀。揚州嘉定之屠殺，别處的人民都是見死不救。明朝便因此而亡。</p>
<p>昨天上海有人發起援助東北義勇軍和上次東南人七募捐接濟黑軍抗日在中華民族發達史上都是重要的事實。這些事證明中華民族已經發展到第二個階段。這次援助東北義勇軍是更有意義，因爲東北義勇軍是純粹人民的武力，發揮出眞正的民族精神。各地方同民族的人互以實力援助，斷然比那空洞的同情心進一步了。</p>
<p>我們却不可以在這個階段流連，以爲捐了一些錢去援助東北義勇軍就算盡了責任。一個民族之造成必在行動之一致。全國人民必須聯合起來和東北義勇軍站在一個戰線上奮鬥，纔算是完成了中華民族之倉造。</p>
<p>不抵抗的軍閥是沉没在第一階段的最下層。他們心目中只有身家，那有民族？所以不抵抗的軍閥是背叛民族精神便是背叛中華民國。全國人民應該立刻奮起與東北義勇軍站在一個戰線上掃除割據的軍閥，驅逐横暴的日軍，恢復已失之國土主權，以完成中華民族創造之重大使命。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第二回談笑對良師傳噩耗家園遇刦零丁憐膩友慰悽情旅室生春</p>
<p>原來伊這個香巢。是布置在坐北朝南的一排上房。共總是三大間。東首一間是伊的臥室。不是尋常人所能隨便進去的。中間一間權當是小客室。凡是可以請到上房來的客人。必須先踏進這個屋子。西首的一間。那才是伊的書齋。這裏面布置得極其雅緻。牆壁上滿懸著名人的字畫。靠着窗前擺着一張紫檀木書桌。上面安放些精美的文具。旁邊并還有一排玻璃書櫉。稀稀朗朗儲藏了些布函的線裝書和皮面滲金字的洋裝書。再配上些椅榻與茶几。一律是紫檀製成的西式木器。也略爲陳設了幾件古色古香的骨董。看來還覺得不俗。進了書齋後。伊逕到書桌前一張轉椅上坐下。一個嬌小的身子。好似疲倦得竪不起來。　縮做一團深深塞在那椅圈兒裏。然後隨手向旁邊另一張椅子指了一指。并很不自然的笑了笑。道先生請坐。該授課啦。魏卓謀嘴裏嗻嗻的應了兩聲。且先忙着替伊從書桌上找出那册日常唸讀的英文課本。翻開來尋着該繼續授的那一頁。很仔細的擺在伊面前。再又將自己帶來的一册洋裝書。也攤開來擺好了。才落坐到伊旁邊。手指着書一句一句的教伊唸。不料伊没精打采。態度失常。兩隻向來最活潑的秋波眼。旣不向書上瞧。也不對先生仁丹鬍子的嘴邊看。只像一雙消失了光波的寳石。嵌呆在伊眼眶中。不知伊痴對着那裏。或沈思到何處。又寂靜得没有一絲聲息。不見伊口角張翕是在跟着先生吚呀唸誦。魏卓謀看看神色不對不。願徒勞就微笑着道。如何。我說你今天没有心思。課就不用上了。你偏要上。此刻可不是白費。壓根兒半句都唸不下去嗎。梁笑雲被魏卓謀那麽一說。也自覺没趣。就信手把書一掃。噗的一聲將一本書掃落在脚跟邊的地毯上。貶貶眼。撅撅嘴。撒着嬌道。我固然是没心思唸。你也不見得肯耐煩教。就拉倒罷。魏卓謀連忙彎着腰替伊將拾起來。仍然陪笑道。學生老爺不要動氣。這都是我做先生的不是。不會哄着學生唸書。如今再要想法子哄也來不及啦拉倒便拉倒。我們還是閒談點别的話吧。再不然。我講個故事。或說個笑話。給你解解悶。梁笑雲猛的把臉蛋兒轉過一邊道。我都不要聽</p>

<p>自日帝國主義者的侵略和殘暴加諸我東北三省後、我全國的靑年、因爲激於義憤和熱血的奔騰、大家自行組織義勇軍、救護隊、間或出發前方效勞、還有分組的演講、貼標語、發傳單、甚而全體的晋京請願、最後在學期未終、自行停課以便作切實的工作、切實的工作尙在開始、各學生在外省的、早已回去過年、在本埠的、也不到學校了、如此星散、工作究竟如何呢、以後的工作、究竟該怎樣做呢、我想不外乎罷課和請願兩點繼續努力了、然而我以爲切實的工作、罷課是絶對不通的、請願也不必全體、全體請願的力量雖大、然而危險也多、以可貴的靑年、而作無謂的犧牲、是多麽的可惜、我們未來的國家、有賴於靑年正大、靑年學子、正宜怎樣自愛呢、</p>

<p>丨丨因爲這是人民自己的武力　　中國養了兩百多萬軍隊，綜合一切團防警察以及雜牌軍隊而計，總數當在三百萬以上，據財政部的報告，每年正規兵所需的軍費，已經佔財政總支出之百分之八十，合其他團防費以及種種勒派的軍費而言，數目字之鉅大，當更足以令人咋舌，然而費了這樣鉅額的軍費養活這樣鉅額的軍隊，却只是爲野心軍閥作爪牙，攘奪利權，榨取人民的血肉，造成二十年來循環不絶的内亂。我們可以說：我國没有國家的武力，没有人民的武力，而只有爲個人作工具禍國殃民的武力。</p>
<p>這次東北禍變爆發，張學良嚴令東北各軍不准抵，抗幾日之間·便失去了東北半壁河山。日軍攻龍江·馬占山將軍孤軍鏖戰，張學良又按兵不動，不發一兵一卒往援，於是龍江又陷落了。日軍攻錦州，張學良又命令駐守錦州的軍隊全師退到關内，絶不應戰，却反藉口中央不發給子彈，不補足餉糈，通電說「不願作政治上的犧牲品。」這樣昏庸懦弱醉心權利的軍人，這樣溺職負國的長官，眞是萬死不足以蔽其辜。</p>
<p>至於關内各省的軍隊，也是一樣的只做個人的工具，槍口只知對内，外患迫近，山河破碎，却充耳若無所聞，人民榨取血汗以養軍隊，養了軍隊却恰足以禍國殃·民這現象眞是夠我們痛心，而同時又是我們一個當頭的明白教訓。</p>
<p>從東北三省陷落以後，各地的義勇軍風起雲湧·隨地襲擊日軍，使敵疲於奔命，錦州之役，駐軍全師退却，養勇軍却死命應戰，嬰城固守，終於寡不敵衆，錦州才終不免於陷落，最近打虎山一帶，又屢次給予敵軍以重創，據昨日報載，并已奪回打虎山，義勇軍聲勢極盛。這種事實，這種行動，眞是可歌可泣，眞是我全民族生命之所寄託呀！</p>
<p>義勇軍是人民自己的武力，惟人民自己的武力才能抗暴禦侮·也才能自救救國。只有人民自己組織起來，武裝起來，自己負荷起救國的責任，國才得救，希望他人，終是望梅止渴，終是徒然。</p>
<p>所以我們現在應該切實援助東北各地艱苦血戰的義勇軍·給予他們以精神上的鼓舞與實力上的接濟。同時各地的人民尤其應該自起組織，準備以自己的武力擊破帝國主義者的武力，及一切恶勢力，必如此，中國才有出路·中國痛苦的人民才有出路。</p>

<h3 id="c257">稀有的死微言 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>「死」原來不是稀有的，因爲；「凡人，必有死」。然而我的朋友賀沬的死，我却以爲是「稀有的」這當然不因爲他是我的朋友：而因爲他也是一個「人」，而且是一個純潔的靑年人的緣故。</p>
<p>在這多難的年頭，「說話」「寫文章」都得小心，這是眞的，然而賀沬並不曾說「不中聽的話」，更不曾寫「不該寫的文章」他整日價祗是坐在房子裏讀書·誰知；「人在房中坐，禍從天上降」，賀沬忽然被捕入獄了·入獄的罪名，據說是在他的書桌上發現了幾本關於研究科學的社會主義的典籍。</p>
<p>「眞理」早已寄居在有權威的人們的籬下，賀沬竟妄想在書本上去找眞理，那當然是不可赦的罪；也就是「犯」了「法」他於是乎很便當的得到了一座玫瑰色的花冠·</p>
<p>不幸賀沬又是一個窮小子，他没有好的東西去塞狗洞；狗洞没有塞，狗自然是會出來咬人丨所以賀沬入獄以後便遭受了多次的非刑拷訊。</p>
<p>這位純潔的靑年，他祗有坦白的一顆心·我知道他固然不曾革過命，却也並未反革命丨或革革命。</p>
<p>革命者之死是「成仁」，反革命者之死是「伏誅」。在理；賀沬旣没有資格「成仁」自然也就不會「伏誅」。於是在不明不白有罪無罪之間，竟被判處了一年又六個月的監禁。</p>
<p>在獸檻一般的鐵窗中，賀沬差不多病了一年，等不到監禁期滿，他的病是一天一天地沉重了没有醫生診治没有藥服，「犯」了「法」的人，「死」也應該，何况只是病呢？</p>
<p>同賀沬處在一個監牢裏的囚徒，眼看着他的病很嚴重了，心裏都有些酸楚，代他向獄卒要求將他足上負荷的鐵鐐解去，因爲事實上他久已不能動彈了。又過了幾天，獄吏發見這埀死的病囚眞不需要銬，了便命獄卒來解去。兩個獄卒將賀沬背出監門，好意的爲他解镣。！鐐解了，人也就死了！</p>
<p>因爲賀沬是「非其罪也」，所以他畢竟不肯帶着鐵鐐死去嗎？我聽到他死的消息時，我不曾爲他出淚；祗是我不解；因爲這是「稀有的死」。</p>

<h3 id="c258">製輕氣的方法丁熙 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>用個面盆，裝滿淸水，再用鉗子取鈉Ｓodium一塊。鈉的分子式是Ｎa，是一種金屬的原質，很容易和空氣化合，故不用時，須浸在煤油中，以防其和空氣化合，發生燃燒。次用剪刀將鈉剪成許多小片，但每片不可過大；因若過大，放在水中燃燒時，有爆發的危險。然後將每小片鈉用紙包好，不能過於包緊；因過於包緊　放在水中時，輕氣一時難以出來但。在用紙包鈉時，切不可將鈉弄到手上，以免皮膚潰爛。這些手續做完後，便將試騐管或較大的玻璃瓶盛水，用右手掌將管口按緊，倒放於臉盆的水中，用左手將管提起，但不能提出水面，因若提出水面，外面的空氣便鑽進去，將管内的水逐出。再用右手拿鉗子將紙包好的鈉·一片一片的鉗到試管口的下方。鈉旣鉗入水，便立刻分解水而變成氫氯化鈉（分子式是Ｎa　Ho），一面放出氫氧（分子式是Ｈ）升入試騐管内將水逐下。等到管内的水盡行逐完後，便用玻璃一方：入水中緊蓋瓶口，然後取出倒放於桌上。因爲輕氣比空氣輕，恐其上升逃散，所以要倒置於桌上。但雖然是倒置，而玻璃蓋仍不可移去。然後將瓶漸漸的移起，括根火柴送入管口，便發出一個微弱的爆炸聲。若將一隻洋燭燃着，送入管口，則見管口發燃燒的火焰，而燭火反在管中熄滅。這就是證明輕氣可以在空氣中燃燒，没有助燃燒的性質。</p>

<p>在愛多亞路，西藏路一帶，以及其他比較寛闊的馬路上，你隨時可以領略到那種别成一格的「馬路文學」。</p>
<p>這種文章大都是用粉筆寫在馬路上，有中文，有西文，中文中又有駢體文，有散文，有古，風有七言，五言絶句。至於字，也有很多寫得極其勁秀。</p>
<p>「余，×地人也早歲卒業於×××學校，繼執教於×處，祇以時運不齊家遭匪刦，人困病魔，淪落申江，親朋斷絶，飢寒鞭苔，男兒氣短，床頭金盡，壯士無顏，遂令伍員不能不簫吹吳市，馮煖不得不鋏彈侯門，是非得已，倍滋傷心，敢乞仁人君子，憫其遭遇，慷慨解囊，涸鮒得甦，啣報有日，被難人×××泣啓」</p>
<p>這是一個例，在這纏綿凄絶的「哀啓」旁邊，大多還附上一首兩首七言絶句，五言絶句，或者是七律五律。</p>
<p>「淪落申江年復年白眼雙擎欲問天；</p>
<p>誰識吹簫吳市客？忍把雙淚落君前。」</p>
<p>這也是一個例，又如：</p>
<p>「日落吳江冷，天寒暮飛鴉；爲問吹簫客：今晚宿誰家？」</p>
<p>這又是一個例，至於英文呢，則“I　am　a　teacher　of”：</p>
<p>“Ｍa　nataiye　Country　is”</p>
<p>這種文學的作家，有男人，也有女人，有時女人還帶着一兩個小孩，總是帶着「怨而不怒，哀而不傷」的態度，向四週的觀衆發生乞憐的眼光。在一條馬路上常常有好幾處，假使你是初到上海的人，你一定會懷疑這是開「露天文學展覽會。」</p>
<p>他們最怕的是煞風景的巡捕，當他一發見巡捕走來時，便悄悄地走開。</p>

<p>「蒙脫卡羅」是一個著名的賭窟，在法國的「摩那瓜」地方·往那裏去賭的，都是些達官貴人們，因爲他們一天到晚閒着没事，所以聚在那裏大賭特賭·</p>
<p>爲着要在「摩那瓜」地方設一大賭塲的緣故，他們，開賭塲的，送了四十萬金鎊給「摩那瓜」地方的太子，這時在一八九九年，後來在一九一三年，又送了他六十萬金鎊，外加每年要付地租五萬金鎊，而且每十年要加一萬金鎊直到租借期滿爲止·雖是他們每年要付這樣驚人的數目的欵子，然而還以爲是很有利能圖呢·那末誰是損失者？不必說，是那些往那裏去賭的人們·</p>

<p>×美租界的成立</p>
<p>據摩爾氏（Ｈ·　B·　Morse)在他所著的「大淸帝國的國際關係」那部書中，說美租界的成立並不是人力創造的，却是自然而然發展成功的，這句話頗有些道理。因爲在租界内的商人爲了覓得地價低廉的土地作爲住宅的原故，所以在租界附近的郊外購買土地。美國聖公會在虹口方面開始購地建築教堂。咸豐四年（公曆一八五四年二月）美國第一任領事到滬，在美租界尙未劃定範圍之前早已在界内懸掛美國國旗。</p>
<p>美國聖公會的主教是彭威廉（Ｗillianr　J·　Boone)</p>
<p>他要求美國領事指定教堂的南界，美領就說以教堂前的河邊小路爲界，於是蘇州河岸屬於聖公會了。</p>
<p>最初不論是美租界也好，法租界也好，都是不繁盛的地方。</p>
<p>後來耶穌教會的教士們，在租界附近從新覓定新址，董家渡天主堂的基石即是道光二十八年十一月二十一日下石的。</p>
<p>最初美國僑民的地位並不十分好，並且美國領事想在英租界内設領事館，都引起英人的反感，可見美法兩國領事其所以要求中國當局另闢租界，實在是由於英人壟斷了英租界，使他們不得不另闢租界安置美法兩國的僑民。</p>
<p>其實不論是英人美人法人，他們並感覺得互相歧視，而且是很和諧的，因爲他們知道他們的利益是一致的，同是來踐踏中國地土的帝國主義者，用不着互相排擠的啊！因此到了同治二年（公曆一八六三年）英美兩租界居然合併而成現在的公共租界了</p>

<p>(Beiping) On the Datong line, the 20th Division of the Japanese Army, led by the Shoda Brigade, arrived at Xinlitun on the 13th to participate in the war. A portion of our 19th and 20th Brigades, along with volunteer soldiers, retreated to the vicinity of Xinqiu due to pressure from the Japanese reinforcements. They are coordinating with our supporting cavalry units. The Japanese army, covered by their air squadron, advanced further into Rehe territory. The two armies are currently in a stalemate near Xinqiu. A fierce battle is expected within the next few days. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line has left only a small force to garrison the area.

(15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops coveting Rehe are eager to seize Xinqiu because it is rich in gold and coal mines with abundant production. The Japanese side had previously obtained coal mining rights and repeatedly attempted to build a light railway between Xinlitun and Xinqiu to facilitate development, but the Northeast authorities never permitted it. Therefore, the Japanese side is now striving to achieve this goal. (10th Dispatch)</p>

The Japanese transported six heavy artillery pieces from Liaoning to Xi Qia, which were incorporated into Yu Chengzheng's bandit army. Three armored trains from Fang Railway advanced northward from Changchun along the Dong Railway, claiming to protect the transportation of goods for the International Transport Society, but in reality, they were assisting the bandit army in attacking Su Dechen's brigade in Shuangcheng.

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, arrived in Tokyo this morning. His first statement here defended the British Ambassador to China, Lampson, refuting the criticisms leveled against Lampson by Japanese newspapers. Shigemitsu told reporters that the Japanese newspapers' accusation that Ambassador Lampson was anti-Japanese was unfair. In fact, Lampson is a sincere friend of Japan.

<p>(Harbin) Oriental Development Bank advisor Suzuki arrived here today on business. It is widely believed that the outcome of this trip will be the reorganization and expansion of the bank's operations. The Oriental Development Bank specializes in real estate business and previously operated here, providing mortgages. Therefore, it owns a considerable amount of property in this area. In the past two years, due to the promulgation of various new laws by the Nanjing government, the Oriental Development Bank has found it difficult to exercise its rights as recorded, and has had to suspend most of its operations. Now that Suzuki has arrived here, the bank will definitely resume operations, and the scope may be even greater than before, covering the entire North Manchuria. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) When the Northeast Incident occurred, the Ministry of Railways awarded 100,000 yuan to the employees of the Beining Railway and approved the payment of two months' salary as a bonus for the 20th year. Due to the difficulty in determining the grade of the bonus, the Railway Bureau held several board meetings without reaching a decision. The workers, impatient due to the approaching Lunar New Year, over a thousand members of the Shanhaiguan Labor Union crowded onto the fourth passenger train on the 15th afternoon to petition in Tianjin. Upon hearing the news, the Railway Bureau immediately telegraphed to stop them, stating that the bonus and salary would be issued within the next few days. The workers disembarked at 3:00 PM, delaying the train for two hours. Over a thousand workers from the Tianjin Machinery and Engineering departments also held a meeting at the East Station at 2:00 PM on the 15th afternoon, expressing much criticism against a certain Director Dang of the Accounting Department, stating that Dang had delayed the payment and deposited the funds in the bank, earning two or three hundred yuan in interest every day. After deliberation, it was decided to limit the payment to within three days, or else a strike would be launched. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway Bureau is finding it difficult to resume traffic because the section outside the pass is held by the Japanese army. Many employees have fled back from outside the pass and have no work to do, causing significant losses to the Railway Bureau. The bureau is now informing employees who have served for more than ten years and are over forty years old to temporarily resign. They will be issued pensions and sent back to their hometowns according to regulations. Those who wish to return to the bureau when traffic is restored will still be employed. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>No Decisions Made After Detailed Consultation</p>
<p>The Central Political Council Will Continue Discussions Today</p>
<p>Generally Believed That Weakness Cannot Continue</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the diplomatic policy towards Japan, at the Central Political Council meeting on the 14th evening, each member verbally expressed their opinions. It was then decided that each member would submit their opinions in writing to the Special Committee for reference. It is heard that the Special Committee has drafted a plan based on these written opinions, but when asked, the attending members stated that due to the sensitive nature of diplomatic secrets and because no complete decision had yet been made, they were unwilling to announce it to the public. Another member said that regarding the Japanese issue, it is generally believed that one can no longer follow the weak path and should take decisive measures, even at any sacrifice. However, this matter is of great importance and requires national unity to be effective. Although the external policy has been repeatedly consulted, it still needs to await the return of the members to Hangzhou to jointly discuss with the members in Nanjing before a complete decision can be made.

Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Chen Youren, Li Jishen, Li Zongren, Zhu Peide, and Feng Yuxiang attended. Secretary-General Zeng Zhongming and Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Bingchang were also present.

The financial issues were not addressed. The meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM.

<p>丨丨The Attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States and China's Path to Self-Salvation丨丨</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of the League of Nations and the circumstances of Britain and France have already been discussed yesterday. Today, let's further discuss the relationship between the Soviet Union, the United States, and us. Russia borders us for tens of thousands of miles. Since the time of Peter the Great, it has been actively striving to obtain an ice-free port in the East. This led to the Russo-Japanese War, which was caused by conflicts of interest with Japan. After the revolution, it still has not relaxed its grip on our Northeast. Seizing navigation rights on the Ussuri River, manipulating the political and economic affairs of Outer Mongolia, and deliberately stalling the Sino-Soviet conference are examples of this. In recent years, the entire nation has been striving to implement the Five-Year Plan, using the capital of world capitalists to develop its domestic resources and increase production. It then dumps these products on the world market, tightening internally and "exploring and competing" externally. This allows the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in the arena of world economic competition and further control the fate of world capitalism. With its full focus on developing the economy and solidifying its foundation, it does not allow itself to be distracted. In terms of diplomacy, it strives to dismantle anti-Soviet alliances, seeking to avoid direct conflict with the capitalist international community. Therefore, when the Northeast Incident occurred, it only satirized the incompetence of the League of Nations and exposed the hypocrisy of imperialism through propaganda. It also incited communist parties in various countries to engage in the work of "transforming international wars into domestic wars," but it could not provide us with substantial assistance. The Soviet Union is deeply aware that Japan's occupation of our Northeast is not only to fulfill its imperialist ambitions but, more importantly, to form an anti-Soviet alliance in the Pacific, aiming to eradicate the foundation of socialist countries in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Compared to Europe, the United States is a newly emerging capitalist nation, adhering to pragmatism as the cornerstone of its national policy. It adheres to the Monroe Doctrine for the Americas and advocates for the Open Door Policy for the world. All the great powers have spheres of influence in China, but the United States does not have one. Therefore, it has no choice but to use equal opportunity as its slogan and treaties as its means to restrain the great powers and maintain the balance of power. The power of American capital penetrates the world without leaving a hole. Our country was originally the best market for foreign goods, but due to years of internal warfare, the country was depleted, and the people were impoverished. Furthermore, Japan's continental policy is ever-expanding, and its investments in China are directly pouring into the Yangtze River basin. The progress of the United States is limited by this in every way. The competition between Japan and the United States in the Pacific has long led discerning individuals to worry about a second world war. However, American investment in Europe is far greater than that in China. Investment in China is only 10% of the investment in Germany. Moreover, its trade with Japan is almost in a ratio of two to one, whether in terms of imports or exports. Therefore, although there are cracks between Japan and the United States, it is still difficult to break ties due to conflicting interests. Initially, the United States used the League of Nations as its first line of defense, flirting with Geneva to lightly offload responsibility to the League of Nations. Subsequently, it used the Dawes Plan to negotiate in Paris, and then sent amorous glances to Japan again. Its intentions were fully exposed. When we abandoned the defense of Jinzhou and withdrew the troops from the Luan River, the United States realized that the first line of defense could no longer be held. It then hastily proposed the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, using them as the second line of defense against Japan. Little did it know that Japan had already seen through the tactics of the United States. Hidesato Hosono had already ridiculed this as a "policy towards China based on a misunderstanding." The relationship between Japan and the United States in the Northeast issue is one of intense competition and intrigue.</p>
<p>British scholar Pu Shi said, "If a territory is inhabited by a barbaric or semi-civilized nation and is extremely rich in natural resources, then that territory will become the focus of competition among various countries." Now that our Northeast has fallen and internal strife is intensifying, foreigners repeatedly ridicule us as a barbaric nation, leaving us almost unable to defend ourselves. Japan has recently been openly proclaiming internationally that China is by no means a "modern nation." If our entire nation does not quickly awaken, unite, and strive forward, then our international status will truly be lost completely. When facing national crises, other countries often form coalition cabinets. In our country, however, opinions diverge even within a single party, and the newly formed government has failed to decide on any practical measures. After receiving the American note, besides issuing a paper expressing acceptance, it has not made any claims of its own. If we want to preserve the integrity of our territory, we should only rely on our own strength. If we merely rely on the support of a third party without demonstrating our true strength, then where will we place the dignity of our entire nation? Now, volunteer armies in the Northeast have risen up in Jinxi, engaging in hand-to-hand combat and shaking the enemy's courage. How can those in power, who still wish to take national survival as their responsibility, bear to watch our righteous men in the Northeast be isolated and without aid? The new Foreign Minister Chen Youren's declaration still seeks to "eliminate the war through diplomatic means." Alas, is that possible? In a national crisis, there is no other diplomatic solution but to fight to the death.</p>

<p>Received a Grand Welcome from the Soviet Government</p>
<p>Rumors of an Asian Alliance are Rampant</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 14th - Tonight, the Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov held an extraordinary grand meeting to welcome the Persian Minister of the Court, Deimotads, with the diplomatic corps and government dignitaries being invited to attend. According to an official announcement, Deimotads' visit to Russia is a formal one. This morning, when Deimotads' special train arrived at the station, Deputy Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Kara Khan, along with Steinburg, Vice Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, personally greeted him at the station. A station guard team was also dispatched, and the Swedish and Norwegian ministers, the Moscow Garrison Commander, the Persian Ambassador to Russia, and the entire Persian overseas community all went to the station to welcome him. Deimotads exited the train and, accompanied by Litvinov and Kara Khan, reviewed the welcoming troops before proceeding directly to the Persian Embassy. Afterwards, he paid respects to Soviet Russian President Kalinin and Chairman of the People's Committee Molotov.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Paris, 15th - News of the Soviet Russian government's grand welcome to the Persian Minister of the Court, Deimotads, has arrived here, instantly reviving rumors that Soviet Russia is planning to organize an Asian group with Persia, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Although the French media's commentary considers it unusual that the capital of communism would treat the Persian King's envoy with such respect, many solemnly declare that the Persian Minister of the Court's visit contains significant meaning. Seeing that Turkish Foreign Minister Rushtai will also visit Russia soon, it is even more evident. French political circles claim that although Soviet Russia's plan has not yet shown signs of realization, the Russian government's invitation of high-ranking Persian and Turkish officials is clearly intended to put pressure on France, inducing it to ratify the Franco-Russian non-aggression pact. However, given the current situation, it is feared that this pact may not be ratified for some time, as Laval is unwilling to antagonize political and military dignitaries who oppose this pact.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Berlin, 15th - The organ of the National Socialist Party, the Local Messenger News, reported that war has broken out in the Far East, causing much destruction, and that the great powers have failed to prevent it effectively. The Disarmament Conference, which is about to open, is feared to become a ridiculous drama. The advance of Japanese troops towards Beiping shows that the Manchurian Incident is not merely a colonial army's expedition with certain limitations. The world's powerful nations will never be obstructed by a few "scraps of paper" in their pursuit of progress. However, as relations between Japan and Soviet Russia become strained, Japan may experience difficulties. Judging from Soviet Russia's military preparations and its desire to maintain the neutrality of several European countries through non-aggression treaties, Soviet Russia's intentions towards Japan can be seen.</p>

<p>Nationalist Faction Forms a Large Independence Party</p>
<p>Plotting to Bomb the Japanese Emperor Was Done By This Party</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Report - Korean revolutionary movement groups are now divided into nationalist and socialist factions. The socialist faction is guided by the Third International and carries out the work of labor and peasant revolution. The members of the national movement faction are quite complex and not united. Until last year, the elite members at home and abroad combined to form a large Independence Party, with its headquarters located in Jilin. Recently, it has moved to the Shanghai area. The party is quite powerful. Anti-Japanese riots in various parts of Korea suddenly increased sharply last year, which is the result of the party's activities. It is said that the central figures are An Changhao, Kim Chiu, Li Tongning, and others. Li Fengchang, who plotted to bomb the Japanese Emperor this time, is indeed a member of the party and belongs to the riot department of the party and was sent from Gyeongseong (Seoul), Korea. After being arrested, he cursed the Japanese loudly and remained silent to all questions. He only said, "I am a member of the Korean Revolutionary Party. I am not afraid even if my body is smashed to pieces. There is no need to question me." After speaking, he continued to curse without stopping, his expression calm and fearless. It is said that he has been sentenced to death by hanging. (World News Agency)</p>

Now someone has challenged England, and if the English fight with them, they will certainly win. However, this method is no longer appropriate. The English government's method of dealing with the situation in India has been effective. However, the English government wants to see peace in India and is willing to gladly cooperate with all sectors of India in a spirit of goodwill. As for the adoption of temporary emergency plans, it will only be limited to the necessary period and will not be extended for even a day. However, if actions to overthrow the government continue to exist, then the emergency plan can only be extended. If the Indians replace threats with sympathy and cooperation, then the English government will immediately respond to this new spirit.</p>

However, Laval still asked him to assist the government in maintaining world peace. Briand replied that he would consider with his colleagues how to assist the government. It is now expected that there will be some changes in the external staff and consular staff after Briand leaves office. The French diplomatic community is paying close attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Urging the United States to Cancel War Debts</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Rome, 15th: This morning, the Milan Italian People's Newspaper published an article urging the United States to alleviate the world crisis, cancel European war debts, and exempt Germany's reparations. This newspaper was founded by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, so it is widely believed that this morning's editorial was personally written by Mussolini. The title of today's editorial is "A Final Admonition to the United States." The article states that Germany's reparations will inevitably cease to be paid one day, a fact recognized worldwide. Moreover, facts prove that Germany's ambassadors abroad have clearly notified the governments of their host countries, stating that Germany no longer has the ability to pay political debts. Regardless of how much various countries lament and protest, this has become an undeniable reality. Therefore, Italy and Britain have proactively planned to change course. Although France insists on its unbreakable convictions, it hesitates because the true attitude of the United States has not yet been revealed and has not launched an attack. Therefore, the power to turn the world's gears rests solely with the United States. The United States is vast, rich in resources, and financially strong. Who would believe that it will withhold a helping hand, allowing the European nations to suffer turmoil and mutual resentment? The article concludes by saying that there is no other way out in this world. Only by forgiving all war debts and reparations can the world be saved from the depths of disaster. Furthermore, any attempt to impose coercive measures on Germany again today is utterly impossible, as the occupation of the Ruhr region will never be seen again.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th: The British pound has soared. This morning in New York, each pound was worth 14 shillings 4.5 pence, due to the British government buying pounds to offset the sale of US dollars and continued receipts of cash from India in London. Prices on the Paris Stock Exchange saw a sudden improvement today, which the French financial community found very strange. This was partly due to the rise in the value of the British pound and partly due to speculation that the US authorities intended to expand lending.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 15th: Yesterday, the pound's price suddenly rose in the European exchange market. This morning, German newspapers speculated. Most financial columnists, like the financial community in general, believed that this price increase was a temporary phenomenon, partly due to a large number of US dollars being sold on the Paris Stock Exchange and partly due to the influx of cash from India into Britain. However, some financial columnists believed that the pound's price increase was due to the Bank of England's efforts to stabilize the pound's price, and they cited news from New York that the Bank of England had instructed people to buy pounds with US dollars on several exchanges as supporting evidence.</p>

<p>Dr. Koch Discovers the Pathogen of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Dr. Bergell Succeeds in Dewaxing Tubercle Bacilli</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Pathogen of Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Forty-nine years ago, on March 24, 1882, the German medical sage, Dr. Robert Koch, delivered a highly valuable paper at the Physiological Congress in Berlin, Germany, titled "The Cause of Pulmonary Tuberculosis." The purpose of the doctor's report was to state that pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is a special infectious disease and not a hereditary condition. He cited various examples to prove this (such as the cultivation, staining, and animal testing of tubercle bacilli). This opened a special and colorful chapter in the 3,000-year history of tuberculosis research. With the pathogen of tuberculosis now identified, a definitive standard for diagnosing tuberculosis was established. Tubercle bacilli are microscopic microbes, extremely small in shape. If one "gram" of them were weighed, the number would be over 350 quadrillion. Their reproductive power is astonishing, destroying human tissue and causing the most terrible tubercular conditions. These germs, when expelled from the human body, cannot reproduce at all but can only maintain their survival. However, once they have the opportunity to invade the human body, they seize the delicate lungs as their main base of operations and run rampant with their terrible power. Alas, there is no greater enemy of mankind than tuberculosis. How can we not fear it?</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Structure of Tubercle Bacilli <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In the past, most doctors, not understanding the unique structure of tubercle bacilli, assumed that all germs could be eradicated with disinfectant medications, either by internal administration or injection, just like "606" is injected for syphilis. Only after Dr. Bergell's painstaking research did he reveal that tubercle bacilli have a special defense against all attacks from external medications. The body of tubercle bacilli is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax. Unless a way is found to destroy the waxy defenses and disarm the fatty armor, there is no way to capture tubercle bacilli and put them to death. Moreover, when tubercle bacilli invade a local part of the human body, the surrounding area is eroded to form a stubborn nodule, obstructing the flow of blood, so that injected or ingested general disinfectants cannot cross this line. It is like a special restricted zone under strict martial law. Since the medicinal power cannot come into contact with the affected area, even if the whole body is submerged in a medicinal pool, the tubercle bacilli will not be harmed. Therefore, the only operational strategy to eradicate tubercle bacilli must meet at least the following two preconditions:</p>
<p>(1) Any medicine that can destroy nodules and directly reach the affected area.</p>
<p>(2) And can strip or dissolve the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes.</p>
<p>Only in this way can a breach be made. Otherwise, it is like scratching an itch through boots. The tubercle bacilli, under these two protections, secretly laugh at people's inability to harm them.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Dr. Koch, the German Medical Saint and Discoverer of Tubercle Bacilli <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>

<h3 id="e67">Successful Dewaxing of Tubercle Bacilli <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Since Dr. Koch discovered that tubercle bacilli are the pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption), tuberculosis scholars in the East and West have competed to find a wonderful way to kill these germs. However, their results have all been failures because they did not know the profound theory that tubercle bacilli can secrete a kind of wax to surround their bodies to defend against external forces. Some, such as Hammarsten and Harry, discovered that using 5% to 10% carbolic acid solution could remove the acid-fast wax of tubercle bacilli. Later, Mommsen used chlorine gas and also removed the acid-fast wax. However, this dewaxing method can only be applied to staining methods in microscopic examination because the drug is highly toxic and cannot be practically used on the human body.</p>
<p>In recent years, some have unexpectedly used chaulmoogra oil for leprosy and achieved unexpected results. Leprosy bacteria and tubercle bacilli are both acid-fast bacteria of the same nature, and chaulmoogra oil has a dewaxing effect and has more than twice the bactericidal power of carbonic acid. As a result, scholars have become enthusiastically interested in trying chaulmoogra oil on tuberculosis patients in the hope of achieving results. They extracted the main components of chaulmoogra oil using chemical methods and tried them on tuberculosis patients in the hope of achieving similar effects. However, they are limited to skin and superficial tuberculosis and can achieve good results, but for deep-seated wax organs such as pulmonary atrophy, liver, kidney, and other tuberculosis, they still cannot achieve any results.</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Bergell, our great teacher to all tuberculosis patients in the world, went a step further, collecting various drugs with animal and mineral properties and painstakingly researching to find a dewaxing agent that is medicinally peaceful and non-toxic. For decades, he racked his brains and exhausted his heart, constantly seeking the most rational and effective chemical agent. Finally, he discovered that a certain effective component in the compressed juice of the intermesenteric glands of special animals has a strong dewaxing effect on tubercle bacilli. He applied this new component to tubercle bacilli, and the result was complete dewaxing. From then on, the claim that the acid-fastness of tubercle bacilli cannot be removed artificially, which was regarded as a great question in the medical community for thousands of years, was completely overthrown. It is truly a new dawn for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a great medical question of the past and present.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Chemical Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is tubercle bacilli, and once these germs enter the human body, they form nodules at that location to block the path of blood flow. Tubercle bacilli can also secrete a kind of acid-fast wax to surround their bodies to defend against the invasion of all external medicinal powers. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the actual body of the germs. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other therapies that doctors have traditionally used have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world because this profound theory is unknown. Based on the above-mentioned theory, modern tuberculosis scholars continue to research tirelessly, and as a result, they have created this chemical holy medicine that kills all consumption germs, called Sanosin. This medicine was invented and successfully developed in accordance with the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch, the German discoverer of consumption germs, and Dr. Bergell, the German inventor of tubercle bacilli dewaxing. According to the current experimental reports from various pulmonary sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this medicine has the effect of penetrating the nodules of pulmonary lesions and dissolving wax, and it also has bactericidal power and can radically cure stage one, two, and three consumption. It is indeed universally effective. In China, it has been chemically tested by the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government, and the medicinal properties are peaceful and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects. The therapeutic effects are briefly listed below.</p>
<p>(1) If the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the acid-fastness of all tubercle bacilli disappears after one minute, and after three minutes, these pulmonary tubercle bacilli are completely killed without exception.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, "Sanosin" can penetrate into tubercular lesions. When examining the tubercle bacilli lurking within the lesions, they have all lost their acid-fastness. This is sufficient proof that their wax has been completely dissolved.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Public Telegram <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Liuchow: Addressed to all newspaper offices, and to all elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts and uncles of the country: China is suffering from heavenly disasters, and turmoil is constant. The Japanese barbarians are rampant, plundering our Northeast. Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and Heilongjiang is even more dangerous. The Ma Army has risen up and fought bitterly for months. Although their spirit is enough to chill the enemy's courage, their strength is difficult to sustain for long. Although our country has many troops, not a single one has gone to sacrifice themselves. The officers and soldiers of this army bear the heavy trust of the people, and feel the pain of the loss of territory. When the country is in trouble, it is our duty to die. Therefore, on New Year's Day, we swear an oath in Yongning to point our spears north. We would rather sacrifice the entire army than allow the Japanese barbarians to succeed. We hope that all compatriots in the country will be of one heart and one mind, and with shared hatred, regard the enemy as our common enemy. The survival of the nation depends on one battle. We respectfully report our sincerity and humbly ask for your clear understanding. Zhang Fakui, Army Commander of the Fourth Army, and Wu Qiwai, Deputy Army Commander, with all officers and soldiers, bow in the cold.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Details of the Riot by Japanese in Qingdao <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence on the 12th: Ever since the Northeast Incident occurred, Japanese residents in Qingdao have been creating disturbances and seeking quarrels daily, hoping to expand the incident and achieve their aggressive goals. Our side has long been aware of their intentions and has tried its best to make concessions in the face of events, so we have been able to live in peace. On the 9th of this month, the "Minguo Daily" published a report about the assassination attempt on the Japanese Emperor, with the headline "Korean Patriot Lee Hwok-so Attempts to Bomb Japanese Emperor Without Success." The Japanese residents then used this as an excuse to make trouble, believing it was an insult to the Japanese Emperor. They held a meeting the other day and sent representatives to meet with the Japanese Consul to protest to the municipal government, demanding that the responsible personnel of the newspaper be severely punished. This matter had not yet been resolved when several Japanese of unknown names broke into the Minguo Daily office at around 9:00 AM on the 12th. The security guard, Xu Yinghua, was unable to stop them. The Japanese went straight into the business department, and one of them threw a glass bottle containing explosives at the stove. With a loud bang, flames shot out in all directions. The glass shattered, and the doors, windows, and floor were burned. The newspaper office was thrown into chaos. They tried their best to put out the fire. The Japanese then fired more than a dozen shots from their handguns and rushed out the door. The police on duty, feeling outnumbered, did not dare to arrest them and allowed them to escape. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately sent personnel to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation and reported to the municipal government, preparing to negotiate with the Japanese consulate. Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another rose. At 4:00 PM on the same day, the Qingdao City Party Headquarters was also burned by the Japanese. It seems that the Japanese felt that burning down the Minguo Daily was not enough to vent their anger. They held an emergency meeting at the Japanese Residents Group on Zhongshan Road at 3:00 PM on the same day. About 300 people attended. Four points were decided on the spot: (1) Dissolve the City Party Headquarters; (2) Close down the Minguo Daily; (3) Punish the president and editor-in-chief of the newspaper; (4) Mayor Shen must personally go to the Japanese Consulate to apologize. The above four points were sent to the Japanese Consul General to negotiate with the municipal government. After the meeting, more than a dozen thugs were sent, carrying handguns, wooden sticks, and bayonets, to provoke trouble at the Minguo Daily office first. By that time, the newspaper staff had already hidden themselves. The Japanese fired several shots to show their force and then left. They then went to the City Party Headquarters and rushed in, pouring oil and setting fire to the auditorium downstairs, intending to burn down the Party Headquarters. The Party members had received information and escaped. The Japanese fired more than a dozen shots upstairs and left in anger. In order to avoid escalating the incident, the municipal authorities only sent plainclothes police to monitor the actions of the Japanese secretly. Therefore, although the Japanese committed outrageous acts, there were no conflicts with the police. After receiving the report, the municipal government lodged a serious protest with the Japanese consulate, but the Japanese Consul did not respond.</p>
<p>It is heard that when the Japanese residents held a meeting, they also decided on a secret plan, namely to overthrow all organizations and groups that are unfavorable to the Japanese residents (such as the City Party Headquarters, the Minguo Daily, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of all circles, the Fishing Company, etc.), and to gather members of the National Essence Society to carry out riots. Once the incident expands, the Japanese Navy can use this as an excuse to land and carry out a plan to occupy Qingdao. It is heard that there are about 300 members of the National Essence Society who have gathered at the Japanese Residents Group and appear to be planning to carry out riots tonight. Therefore, the situation in the city tonight is extremely serious. European and American residents have received the news and are holding a meeting at the International Club to discuss preventive measures.</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence on the morning of the 13th: The riot by Japanese in Qingdao has been reported in yesterday's letter. The following are further details of the Japanese atrocities last night (12th):</p>
<p>▲ Burning of the City Party Headquarters: After the Japanese residents convened an emergency meeting and decided on riot measures, they proceeded according to the planned plan. First, they gathered more than 300 members of the National Essence Society and assembled at the Japanese Residents Group at 7:30 PM to await orders. At 8:30 PM, the members, all carrying handguns, wooden sticks, and bayonets, set off together. They first sent people to block all the roads and then piled up the pre-placed explosives downstairs in the City Party Headquarters. With a loud bang, a raging fire erupted. In less than half an hour, the flames soared into the sky, illuminating the entire city. Chinese and foreign residents were frightened and uneasy. The fire brigade heard the alarm and tried to rush to put out the fire, but they were all stopped by the Japanese National Essence Society members, who did not allow them to go. In order to avoid conflict and prevent the incident from escalating, the municipal government had no choice but to stand by and watch it burn. Fortunately, the City Party Headquarters staff and workers received the news in advance and escaped, avoiding a tragic end. The City Party Headquarters is located on Taiping Road, Nanhai Cliff, very close to the consulates of various countries such as Britain and the United States. The building is a four-story building, solid and spacious, and is one of the most numbered buildings in Qingdao (the house is the property of the Opium King, Liu Zishan, and is now owned by the government for use). There are hundreds of rooms up and down. The City Executive and Supervisory Committee and the First District Party Headquarters are located here, and the staff dormitory is also inside. This time, it was burned by the Japanese, and it has become a pile of tiles and debris. Only the surrounding stone walls stand tall, and the interior has been reduced to ashes. The total loss is estimated to be around 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Vandalism of the Minguo Daily: After the Japanese rioters burned down the City Party Headquarters, they went to the Minguo Daily office on Zhongshan Road. The Japanese originally intended to burn the newspaper office to the ground, but because the newspaper office was in the downtown area and surrounded by Japanese houses, they were afraid of being affected, so they temporarily changed their plan. After the rioters arrived at their destination, they rushed in and vandalized the newspaper's business department, editorial department, movable type department, and printing department. All the lead type racks, printing machines, doors, windows, and tables and chairs were smashed to pieces and scattered on the ground, making it a horrible sight. All the items in the staff dormitory on the third floor were also vandalized and left in a mess. When the newspaper office was vandalized, there were police officers on duty all around, but they did not dare to interfere because they were afraid of the Japanese violence.</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence on the afternoon of the 13th: There are two Japanese warships anchored in Qingdao, the Izumo and Yakumo. Last night (12th), when the Japanese set fire to the City Party Headquarters, the warships used searchlights to illuminate the streets of Qingdao. At around 10:00 PM, the landing parties of the two warships, about 600 men, landed armed on the front sea, ostensibly to protect the Japanese consulate and Japanese residents. Some were stationed near the Japanese consulate on the front sea cliff, and some were stationed to the left and right of the Japanese Residents Group on Zhongshan Road. At that time, important roads were blocked, traffic was cut off, and they were armed with live ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy. At around 12:00 AM, a Russian man passing through the Japanese military-controlled area on the front sea cliff was stabbed several times by Japanese soldiers with bayonets. He was seriously injured and was taken to Qingdao Hospital for treatment. Their barbaric situation can be seen. Only at dawn did the Japanese soldiers on Zhongshan Road retreat to the Japanese Residents Group. Traffic in the city was restored, but the posts near the Japanese consulate were never withdrawn, and several sentries were stationed on the roof of the consulate for lookout. However, the Japanese soldiers have not clashed with the local police.</p>
<p>After the Japanese residents burned down the City Party Headquarters and vandalized the Minguo Daily, they still felt it was not enough. At 10:00 AM this morning (13th), they sent 23 representatives to the municipal government to request to see Mayor Shen Honglie. Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng met with them on his behalf and asked their intentions. The representatives made many unreasonable demands. Hu replied that if they had any opinions, they could directly express them to the consulate of their country, and the consulate would then negotiate with the municipal government. The government was not in a position to discuss directly with the representatives. After about two hours of conversation, they dispersed without results. At 3:00 PM, the Japanese residents held another emergency meeting to discuss expanding the incident and how to proceed. The content was highly confidential. It is heard that there were several items: (1) Eliminate all news organizations in Qingdao (according to the Minguo Daily method); (2) Vandalize the Fishing Company (because it hinders Japanese fishing) and the Exchange, and domestic goods malls; (3) Dissolve the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, etc. After the meeting, more than a dozen representatives went to the municipal government at 5:00 PM to see Mayor Shen. The results are unknown, but according to Japanese sources, Mayor Shen has negotiated a peaceful resolution with Japanese Consul General Kawagoe, stationed in Qingdao. The conditions are as follows: (1) Regarding the Minguo Daily's report on the incident, the municipal government will issue an official document to the Japanese consulate expressing regret and seriously warning Chinese newspapers to pay special attention to future reports related to the Japanese Imperial Family in order to maintain friendly relations; (2) Liu Youting, the president of the Minguo Daily and a standing committee member of the Party Headquarters, will personally visit Consul General Kawagoe at the Japanese Consulate General to express regret for the inappropriate report and prove that similar incidents will never happen again in the future; (3) The municipal government will order the Minguo Daily to suspend publication for ten days and suspend the editor-in-chief of the newspaper; (4) After the Minguo Daily resumes publication, it will publish a statement acknowledging the inappropriateness of the report and admitting its mistake. As for the Japanese rioting and burning of the City Party Headquarters, the municipal government will file a negotiation with the Japanese consulate for separate handling.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Japanese Consulate in Fujian Pressures Chinese Newspapers <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Actually Grants Its Request to Seal the Newspaper and Arrest People</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Sino-Japanese negotiations that have occurred in Minyuan in recent days have been reported in the previous newspaper. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, the Japanese Consul again pointed to the "Oriental Daily" and the "New Tide Daily," stating that the reports and comments on the assassination of the Japanese Emperor contained insults and ridicule of the Japanese Emperor. He used the telephone to threaten the provincial government, saying that the officers and soldiers of the Japanese fleet stationed in Fujian were extremely indignant at the reports and were about to send all armed soldiers to the shore to demonstrate. He said that he was now trying his best to dissuade them. He said that if the provincial government did not take action against the two newspapers within two hours, the consul would not be responsible for the safety of Fuzhou. His tone was extremely strong. After receiving the phone call, the provincial government immediately convened a joint meeting of the Party, government, and military to discuss countermeasures. As a result, the "Oriental" and "New Tide" newspapers were ordered to suspend publication, and Wu Changming, the president of the "New Tide" newspaper, was sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. After the meeting, they also used the telephone to reply to the Japanese Consul. In the afternoon, they convened a meeting with news reporters, and Lin Zhiyuan, the provincial committee, reported the course of the negotiations, and ordered all newspapers to submit news drafts regarding Japan to the Garrison Headquarters for review before they could be published to avoid causing negotiations. Newspaper reporters said that since the Northeast Incident, the "Minbao," which was run by the Japanese in Fuzhou, had also published many insulting reports about the Chinese authorities. For example, before Chiang Kai-shek stepped down, he was even called a tyrant and deserved to be torn apart by five horses. Insulting the head of state of the country in this way, the provincial government did not say a word to correct it. However, a domestic newspaper slightly criticized the head of state of another country and was severely punished with suspension of publication and detention. This was an unprecedented initiative and caused deep indignation. Some extreme people said that since freedom of speech was so restricted, it would be better to suspend publication altogether to avoid the provincial government being responsible. The discussions were varied and inconclusive (February 11).</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Japanese Government Publishes the So-Called "Sino-Japanese Secret Agreement"? <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The "Sino-Japanese Secret Agreement" recently promoted by the Japanese side has been firmly denied by our country's diplomatic authorities. According to the Japanese Dent Agency, the Japanese government said that regarding the Treaty on the Restoration of Manchuria and its attached agreement, which were concluded in December of the 38th year of Meiji (1905), Japan had specifically requested that the restrictive matters be inserted into the main clauses. The Qing side decided not to announce them due to internal relations. There were 16 of these restrictive matters. However, there are many misunderstandings in the public about the existence of the secret agreement, and some important Chinese figures have denied it. Recently, Chinese news carried the official denial message from the Chinese authorities. The Japanese government, in response to the Chinese side's denial, today (15th) publicly released the full text through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content is as follows: (1) The railway between Changchun and Jilin will be funded by the Qing country, but if the funds are insufficient, it must borrow from Japan, and the amount must be about half of the total amount of funds required. The loan contract shall be negotiated in accordance with the loan contract between the Qing Imperial Railway Bureau (Shanhaiguan Nei Wai Railway Bureau) and the Qing-British combination. The loan term is 25 years, and it will be repaid annually in installments. (2) The military railway laid by Japan between Fengtian and Xinmin will be sold to the Qing country by commissioners appointed by the two governments to fairly agree on the price. The Qing country will rebuild it into a self-operated railway. In addition, the amount of funds required for the line east of the Liao River must be invested by Japanese capital and repaid annually in installments within 18 years. The loan contract shall also be negotiated in accordance with the loan contract between the Beiqing Imperial Railway Bureau and the English-Qing combination. Military railways in other places will be removed when the troops are withdrawn. (3) The Qing government, for the purpose of protecting the interests of the South Manchuria Railway, shall not lay other main lines or branch lines of railways close to or parallel to the railway that may hinder the interests of the railway before the railway is recovered. (4) The Qing country must make Russia faithfully and strictly implement the Qing-Russian Treaty on all railways in North Manchuria and take full measures. If Russia violates the provisions of the treaty, the Qing country must make a serious protest for the sake of correction. (5) In the future, when Japan and Russia continue to negotiate the start of railway business in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Treaty of Peace between Japan and Russia, Japan must notify the Qing country in advance. At this time, the Qing country must inform Russia through the commissioners dispatched by the country, expressing that it must participate in the negotiation, and participate only after Russia recognizes it. (6) With regard to the mines in the Fengtian Province surrounding the railway, regardless of whether they have been mined or not, a fair and detailed regulation shall be formulated for mutual compliance. (7) Regarding connection operations, telegraph lines in Fengtian Province, and submarine telegraph lines between Lushun and Yantai, general related matters may be handled by the two countries through consultation at any time if deemed necessary. (8) The regulations on opening up various places in Manchuria shall be made by the Qing country itself, but it must consult with the Japanese Minister in Beijing in advance. (9) If the Russian side does not object to the navigation of Japanese ships on the Songhua River, the Qing country should recognize the navigation. (10) After the troops of Japan and Russia withdraw from Manchuria, the Qing plenipotentiary committee, for the sake of guaranteeing the sovereignty of the Qing country and the peace of the place, must take sufficient administrative measures, and for the sake of promoting benefits and eliminating malpractices, it should earnestly strive to restore peace. On the one hand, it is declared that the Qing government will fully protect the safety of life and occupation of all foreigners residing in the region, but the Qing government will take appropriate measures to settle the matter regarding the restoration of order. (11) If the Japanese plenipotentiary committee has military necessity, the Qing government shall notify the Japanese government in accordance with the purpose of the declaration to take action against the Japanese subjects residing in Fengtian. On the one hand, in order to enhance friendly relations between the two countries, the two governments shall take appropriate measures to prevent future interference in the administration of the Qing country or damage to public and private property. (12) Before the Japanese troops withdraw from Manchuria after the restoration of peace, if governments interfere in the administration of Qing local officials or damage Qing public and private property by exercising rights due to military occupation, according to this declaration, the two governments shall jointly estimate and compensate the losses fairly. (13) When Qing local officials want to send troops to suppress bandits before the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from the place, they must consult with the Japanese military commander stationed in the place in advance to avoid misunderstandings. (14) The Japanese plenipotentiary committee shall not, before the withdrawal of troops, interfere in the local administration of the Qing country without reason or leave the railway zone without permission with regard to the railway garrison between Changchun, Lushun and Dalian leased land boundary lines. (15) Before the Japanese troops withdraw, the Qing local officials in Yingkou shall not enter the area without authorization to handle official duties. The date of appointment of Qing officials shall be determined after this treaty is finalized, but the Japanese Minister in Beijing and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall quickly negotiate and decide on it. In the area, since there are still a large number of Japanese troops, the quarantine and epidemic prevention rules shall be agreed upon by the officials of the two countries to prevent the spread of immune diseases. (16) The income of the Yingkou Customs shall be kept in Yokohama Specie Bank and returned to the Qing country when the troops are withdrawn. The regular customs revenue of Yingkou and other local tax revenues shall be used as local expenses. The revenue and calculations shall be handed over to the Chinese local officials when the troops are withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japanese Forcibly Seize Xi'an Coal Mine <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Xi'an Coal Mine, which belongs to the Northeast Mining Bureau, is located northeast of Shenyang and is directly accessible by the Shenhai Railway, about 200 miles away from the provincial capital. It is a good coal mine in Liaoning Province and has long been coveted by the Japanese. It was previously operated by ten mining merchants separately. Five years ago, new shares were added. In addition to the original capital and loans, a total of 1.4 million yuan was used to expand the organization and rename it the Xi'an Coal Mining Company. However, the mining rights are still in the name of the various mining merchants. Later, due to poor engineering, the daily coal production was only 300 tons. In the spring of last year, the board of directors hired Wang Zhengfu as the general manager and continued to increase shares by more than 1 million yuan to raise funds for activities and focus on management and reform of work. The output was finally increased to 800 tons per day. New machinery was purchased and electricity was installed. On the one hand, convenience of transportation was sought, and the number of workers was increased to more than 5,000. It was expected that by the end of the year, the daily production could reach more than 1,000 tons. Unexpectedly, the September 18th Incident occurred, and transportation and finance were completely blocked by the Japanese. Under these circumstances, workers had to be dismissed and operations temporarily suspended. The company had no funds, so coal strips were used as collateral to develop Wang Zi. Until October 7th, former Japanese Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku, Wada Jiwei, police adviser of the Shenhai Railway Pseudo Committee, and Yasuda Yuzo, who was transferred from the Fushun Mine, led more than 20 armed Japanese people to the An Mine, claiming to be investigating, and tempted them with sweet words. The company side politely refused and had no room to take advantage of it. Except for Kawamoto Daisaku who returned to Shenyang City, the remaining Japanese people stayed on the street in the name of investigation. On the 16th, Kawamoto returned from Shenyang, leading all the Japanese people who stayed on the street and entered the mountain with great fanfare, directly claiming to take over the Xi'an Coal Mine, and followed a pseudo-industry office chief An to force the handover freely, intending to forcibly occupy it. At that time, the acting mine director of the mine, Fu, said that the company established with state capital should follow the formal procedures and the shareholders agreed before the handover could be sternly refused. They left in disappointment. Mining Director Fu knew that their ambitions were difficult to suppress, so he went to Shenyang intending to mediate, but he was met by Kawamoto, who sent him to the Japanese Military Police Corps and detained him for eight days before he was released. On the 28th, the Japanese forcibly occupied the Xi'an Mine, appointed themselves as the general manager, appointed Yasuda as the mine director, presided over the mine administration, and distributed more than 20 Japanese people transferred from the Fushun Mine to various affairs and seized it wantonly.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Twists and Turns in the Replacement of the Director of the Shandong Tax Audit Office by the Provincial Government <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the Shandong Provincial Government took over the national tax agencies such as the National Transportation Envoy, it appointed Chai Chunlin as the director of the Shandong branch of the Salt Affairs Audit Office to take over. The director, Li Zhifan, immediately handed over the position, but the deputy director (that is, the associate) British Blake expressed opposition. The reason was that the audit office was established due to foreign debt relations, and he was dispatched by the Ministry of Finance. If the provincial government replaced him, he would have to ask the ministry for instructions. Therefore, he refused to sign the official documents that came and went. According to the salt tax loan contract, the deputy director was a national of the lending country, and all official documents also had to be signed by him to take effect. Chai Chunlin reported to the provincial government, and the provincial government telegraphed the Audit General Office for negotiations. Blake also telegraphed the General Office for instructions. As of yesterday, the provincial government had received a reply from the Audit General Office that if the salt payment part of the foreign debt should be deducted, it could be retained as the number, and there was no objection. Blake also went to the provincial government yesterday to meet with Han Yi and expressed his agreement, and would continue to assist in the future. A small negotiation was resolved (13th).</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hunan Provincial Government Demands Funds from the Central Government <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Short-Disbursed 600,000 Should Be Disbursed Promptly</p>
<p>▲ Increase Subsidies According to the Budget in the Future</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The national and local taxes in Hunan Province have long been divided, with all the national tax revenue used as military expenses for the Fourth Route Army, and the unified tax, land tax, and deed tax used as administrative expenses. The military expenses have been short due to years of expansion, and the arrears have reached ten months. From January of this year, the military expenditure was reduced to 1 million yuan, and the salt tax increased by 2.5 yuan per package from January to replenish the military expenditure. There will be no more difficulties in the future. As for administrative expenses, since the unified tax was abolished last year, the reliable revenue of 700,000 yuan per month has suddenly decreased. Although business tax and production and sales tax are held, the total monthly revenue is only 300,000 yuan, which is not enough to compensate for it. The monthly subsidy of 200,000 yuan from the Central Government has not been disbursed for nearly three months, resulting in an accumulated deficit of more than 6 million yuan in the provincial treasury. Before the abolition of the Likin tax, the Fourth Route Army borrowed more than 5.4 million yuan in military expenses from the provincial treasury, which has not been repaid yet, so the administrative expenses are unusually exhausted. He Jian telegraphed the Central Government yesterday to present the difficulties and requested four points: (1) Please raise and remit the subsidy of 600,000 yuan from October to December of last year in full within one month; (2) Increase the subsidy according to the budget deficit; (3) Find a way to have the national treasury allocate and return the military expenses; (4) Fully grant the province and local authorities the right to tax. The original telegram is recorded as follows: National unification, political renewal, and finance are the source of all administrations. It depends on internal and external maintenance to lay the foundation of the country and seek construction. Hunan is located at the crossroads of north and south and is particularly poor. Years of disasters and military disasters have made the people miserable. Since the division of national and local taxes in Hunan Province, all national taxes have been used for military purposes, and the monthly hardship is insufficient. Over the years, the provincial money has been used to borrow more than 5.4 million yuan, and requests for allocation have been fruitless. The provincial local tax revenue is often shorter than that of other provinces. Since the order to abolish the Likin tax was issued, Hunan Province first complied with the central government's tax reform purpose and abolished the unified tax, losing more than 8 million yuan in tax revenue each year. Unexpectedly, the central government has approved a subsidy of 200,000 yuan, which has been suspended for three months. The newly established business tax only collects more than 60,000 yuan per month. The total of land tax, deed tax, and other existing taxes is only more than 400,000 yuan. Moreover, disasters have occurred repeatedly, and tax sources have been exhausted. The current sales tax revenue maintains the food supply for various agencies. It is also exhausted abnormally. The expenditures have been tightened several times, from more than 1.69 million yuan per month to 1.1 million yuan. With the current revenue, the minimum recurring administrative expenses are also short of more than 700,000 yuan per month, and temporary expenditures outside the budget are not included. According to statistics, the provincial treasury owes more than 6 million yuan to various agencies for recurring expenses. The recent financial situation in Hunan Province has been reported to the departments and courtyards. In order to reform politics, provincial governance is particularly important to the national plan. I would like to give an overview. I hope that the central government will be aware of the province's financial crisis and kindly remit the subsidy of 600,000 yuan, a total of three months from October to December of last year, in full within one month. In the future, the rescue method should still be based on the divided standards and increase the subsidy for the local budget deficit in Hunan Province and remit it monthly. It will also be possible to allocate and return the borrowed military expenses, and give the province and local authorities the right to tax. However, in order to promote the abolition of malpractices in the constitutional government period, we should proceed with it fully so that the country can cope with the current difficulties. The Hunan Provincial Government Chairman He Jian and all members respectfully bow (January 13th).</p>

<p>▲ Wang Jun Went to Bian to Agree with Liu Zhi</p>
<p>▲ Shangguan's Division Moved to the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jun believed that in the midst of the national crisis, the eastern section of the Longhai Road defense during the winter defense period was important. He took a special train to Bian on the morning of the 11th to meet with Liu Zhi. He arrived in Bian at 8:00 PM that night and immediately discussed the defense between eastern Henan and Xuhai with Liu. He left Bian in the morning of the 14th and returned east. He arrived in Xu at 1:00 PM. It is heard that regarding the eastern section of the road defense, it is stipulated that the Liang Guanying Department 32nd Division 95th Brigade Liu Guoming Department will be stationed in the Haizhou area. The defense of the port and the ports, and the road defense of the eastern section of Longhai, will be undertaken by the Liu Brigade. From Haibu to the west, from Guanhuh to Pijiang, the three counties of Sanxian area to Yangji, the Seventh Division will send teams to be stationed. The railway along the eastern Henan will be manned by the Second Cavalry Division Zhang Lisheng stationed in Guide by Liu Zhi. In addition to maintaining road defense, each garrison also consolidates local winter defense. In addition, the 21st Brigade Li Wenbin, of the Seventh Division, was originally stationed in Bengbu and was in charge of the southern section of the Jinpu Road defense. The 47th Division Shangguan Yunxiang Department arrived in Bengbu and was in coordination with the Li Brigade for defense. At the moment, the Shangguan Division has been ordered to move to the southern section of the Pinghan and the southern section of the Jinpu defense is still in the hands of the Li Brigade. From then on, the defense of Xuhai Yubeng can echo each other and be closely linked (January 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e80">Seven Stranded River Steamers Escape Danger <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲Location: Prince downstream of Anqing</p>
<p>Anqing correspondence: At Prince, sixty miles downstream of Anqing, since the onset of winter, the river water level has been dropping daily. The water level there is especially shallow compared to other places. Furthermore, the interwoven waterways and the surging waves have led to as many as seven Yangtze River merchant steamers becoming stranded there one after another recently. It is truly an unfortunate event for navigation. Investigations show that the merchant ships stranded there include Jiangxin of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Xin Ningxing, Yongxing, Fulong, and Songpu of Sanbei Steam Navigation Company, Pinghe of Jardine Matheson, and Wuxue of Butterfield &amp; Swire, among others. The locations of the strandings were roughly the same. According to navigation industry sources, the strandings of the aforementioned merchant ships mostly occurred at night. The reason for this is that the drivers of each ship were occasionally inattentive, leading to accidents. Currently, the provincial government views these events as an unprecedented occurrence in the navigation industry. Additionally, the China Merchants Anhui Bureau and others have repeatedly requested protection. Therefore, the Anfeng patrol warship was dispatched to patrol and protect, and to find ways to transport passengers. When the warship arrived at the location, it was already late at night. Faint sounds of gunfire were heard intermittently from the shore, believed to be bandits lying in wait. The ship quickly moved forward, calming the people's hearts. Among them, the Xin Ningxing ship carried a larger number of passengers. Because the stranding lasted for a long time, the passengers made a great commotion towards the ship. The captain of the warship, Liu Wenyu, boarded the ship to comfort them and convey the Anhui provincial government's intention to provide protection. The turmoil subsided. Some foreigners on the ship were eager to leave. The warship first transported more than sixty passengers to Anhui, where they transferred to other ships to leave. Subsequently, the warship carried seventy members of the provincial government's guard regiment armed with pistols to protect. Liu Pengyi, the director of the Anhui Department of Finance, traveled downstream on the Jiangxin ship to Beijing to discuss Anhui's finances with the Ministry of Finance and then went to Shanghai to negotiate with Song Ziwen about the previous arrears of the cooperative loan. Liu then passed by the Anfeng warship. At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, the Jiangxin ship was successfully towed out of danger by the Jianguo ship, and Liu resumed traveling downstream on that ship. The Yongxing ship also escaped danger on the same day. The Xin Ningxing ship escaped danger on the 12th. The Fulong and Songpu ships both escaped danger on the 13th. As of 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, all the stranded merchant ships had escaped danger one after another, and each set sail separately. The passengers were all safe and sound. It is also heard that the customs authorities have dispatched several survey ships to the river area to measure the water currents, mark dangerous locations with signs, and prohibit merchant ships from passing through at night and restrict overloading to prevent danger.

<h3 id="e81">Losses from Flooding in the Yangtze and Huai River Basins <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>▲Total losses estimated at 200 million yuan</p>
<p>▲Estimated disaster relief needs for farmers are 140 million yuan</p>
<p>Last year's floods spread throughout the country, with the Yangtze and Huai River basins suffering the most severe damage. After the National Government's Flood Relief Committee was established, disaster situation investigation forms were sent by the disaster area work group to the affected county governments for completion and reporting. Also, due to the excellent facilities of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Nanjing Jinling University and their extensive experience in agricultural surveys, they were specially commissioned to investigate the losses to agriculture and the situation and needs of farmers in the disaster areas of the Yangtze and Huai River basins. This investigation has now been completed, and the results can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Scope of Investigation: This investigation included six provinces: Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan, covering ninety counties, two hundred and forty-eight locations, and two thousand three hundred and sixty-six villages, with eleven thousand seven hundred and ninety-one farm households. Jinling University first sent personnel to Yuezhou, Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Yancheng, Tai County, Qingjiangpu, Wuhu, and Yuanzhou to establish offices and train local investigators. After the training, they were dispatched to the selected severely affected counties to conduct household-by-household investigations.</p>
<p>(2) Disaster Losses: The population of farmers affected by the disaster in the Yangtze and Huai River basins is approximately equal to the entire population of farmers in the United States. The percentage of farmhouses in the disaster area that were washed away by the flood was 45%. The percentage of farmers who migrated elsewhere was 40%. The average depth of waterlogging in the countryside was approximately nine feet. Livestock losses were approximately 59%, and agricultural tool losses were 61%. Stored grain and fodder were completely washed away and no longer exist. Based on the above figures, the estimated losses suffered by farmers in all 121 affected counties in the Yangtze and Huai River basins can be categorized as follows: 867,000,000 yuan for submerged agricultural products, 470,000,000 yuan for houses, 135,000,000 yuan for draft animals, 115,000,000 yuan for agricultural tools, 79,000,000 yuan for stored grain, 68,000,000 yuan for clothing and bedding, 60,000,000 yuan for fuel, 54,000,000 yuan for furniture, 30,000,000 yuan for other livestock, and 15,000,000 yuan for feed. The total is approximately 1,897,000,000 yuan, with an average loss of approximately 451 yuan per farm household. Losses to dikes, roads, and winter agricultural products were not included.</p>
<p>(3) Estimated Urgent Needs of Farmers: According to the results of the investigation, the urgent needs of farmers are (1) clothing and food, (2) livestock feed, (3) grain seeds, and (4) materials for repairing houses. The approximate amounts are as follows: 503,000,000 yuan for food, 470,000,000 yuan for materials for repairing houses, 88,000,000 yuan for fuel, 56,000,000 yuan for clothing and bedding, 251,000,000 yuan for grain seeds, draft animals, and agricultural tools, and 94,000,000 yuan for other urgent needs. The total amount of these urgent needs is 1,462,000,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Closure of the Jiangsu Provincial Guard Corps Cadre Training School <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Reason: Lack of funds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Guard Corps Cadre Training School, which was previously approved by the National Government upon submission by Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, in conjunction with Ye Chucang, the former Chairman of the Provincial Government, to establish a training school in Yangzhou with a training period of six months and a regular monthly expense of 19,000 yuan, to be drawn from provincial funds, was suddenly suspended due to a lack of funds less than a month after its opening. At the time of the school's closure, a declaration was issued, stating, "The purpose of establishing this school was to enable the people of Jiangsu Province to combine with military force, so that the militia could provide effective protection for the people. After several months of preparation, the school was finally established. Now, with the approval of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it is to be suspended due to lack of funds. The project has been abandoned halfway. Feeling deeply regretful, we are ashamed to face the people of Jiangsu. We hereby respectfully present the reasons for the school's establishment, the process of its suspension, and our hopes for the future to the elders and brethren of Jiangsu Province. The reasons for the school's establishment can be divided into three points: (1) It was for the sake of permanent pacification. The situation in Jiangsu Province is complex, with numerous ports and waterways. The areas bordering neighboring provinces are particularly prone to bandit activity. Although the existing pacification forces, consisting of four divisions, can temporarily suppress banditry, they are still insufficient for thorough purification. This is because bandit activity is unpredictable and comes and goes without warning. Relying solely on military force is not the fundamental solution. To achieve permanent pacification, we must seek the people's self-defense capabilities. This is one of the reasons for establishing this school. (2) It was for the purpose of cultivating self-defense talents among the people. The cultivation of the people's self-defense capabilities begins with training. Although people's militias have been organized in each county of Jiangsu Province, the quality of training varies greatly. In some cases, they are merely militias in name and are unable to provide protection. In the event of an incident, they are easily captured by bandits, and the local area is ravaged, leaving the people with nowhere to escape. Therefore, militia training is urgently needed. However, it is necessary to seek qualified instructors for training. It is not possible to assign them from one place, as they may not be familiar with the local conditions. Nor is it advisable to allow them to be hired freely, as the methods may vary greatly. It is better to gather talents from various places, and after training, send them back to their hometowns to handle local affairs. Local people handling local affairs will achieve twice the results with half the effort. Therefore, it was stipulated that each county and district should select outstanding members of the militia to be admitted to the school, provide them with basic military training, and send them back to their original places after six months to undertake training work, teaching them step by step, like passing a flame from one torch to another, so that all counties in the province can establish well-trained militias with strong self-defense capabilities, so that the people can rely on them in times of emergency. This is the second reason for establishing this school. (3) It was for the purpose of saving military forces and transferring them to national defense. The country raises troops for national defense. In the case of Jiangsu Province, there are no fewer than four divisions stationed in Jiangnan and Jiangbei. This is not a small number. Pacification is only a temporary measure. If every province needs troops for pacification, the cost will be enormous. Moreover, at a time when foreign powers are encroaching, Jiangsu Province is a vital area for coastal defense. In the event of an emergency, the entire army will inevitably be deployed to face the enemy. If the local militias are trained, not only will bandits be unable to rise up, but they will also be able to ensure the safety of the rear, so that the country will have no internal worries and the people will enjoy peace and tranquility. This is in terms of wartime. In peacetime, troops can be freed up to cultivate and defend the borders. If one province does this, the whole country can do so. This can curb the ambitions of large and fierce enemies. Wouldn't the results be even greater? This is the third reason for establishing this school." Based on the above three reasons, we consulted with the former Chairman of the Provincial Government, Ye, and obtained his consent. On one hand, we jointly submitted the plan to the central government for filing. On the other hand, we mutually encouraged progress in terms of both human resources and finances. As a result of these efforts, we were able to admit more than 600 qualified students in December of the 20th year and implement classroom training. This is a brief overview of the establishment of the school. We hoped that with continued training, the people of Jiangsu Province would be able to combine with military force, the militia would be able to provide effective protection for the people, and the pacification work would be completed once and for all. Unexpectedly, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was reorganized at this time. The new members, upon taking office, felt that the finances were difficult and decided to propose the suspension of the school. Although we wanted to maintain the school, we were powerless to do so, and the planned project was abandoned halfway. It is deeply regrettable. Jiangsu Province is a region with abundant wealth and a concentration of talent. Although it suffered from a disaster this year, its vitality will not be difficult to restore. We hope that enlightened and enthusiastic individuals will wait until the financial strength is slightly improved and continue this established plan in advance to plan this permanent peace for the local people. If it can benefit the people, why must the results be attributed to us? If this is the case, then although the school is temporarily suspended, its spirit is not lost, and there is still hope for revival. The goal is still high, and it will eventually be achieved. This is also our personal hope. We hope that the elders and brethren will give us their kind attention. This is our declaration." (January 13)</p>

The members of the County Chamber of Commerce believe that it violates business interests and telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance, stating, "According to reports, the Provincial Government Committee's 460th meeting revised and passed the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Rectification Measures. There is a uniform collection of business tax for wholesale and retail, etc. The so-called 'in accordance with regulations,' we do not know according to what kind of regulations. If it violates the ministry regulations, and says 'in accordance with,' it is deceiving the merchants. How can our merchants bear the increased burden?

<p>Unemployed Workers Falsely Accused of Petitioning The unemployed worker representatives Chen Hanting, Xu Huanting, Wang Zhiyi, Wang Kecheng, and Zhao Jinhua were recently sued in the county court by Zhang Ming, Yuan Yuxiang, and Qiang Huamin for harming their reputation. The court hearing was held yesterday. For the sake of unity, the labor community organized a support association and hired lawyer Tang Ying to provide free legal defense. On that day, approximately 100 unemployed workers gathered at the original site of the former Federation of Trade Unions. They then marched to the county party headquarters to petition. Committee member Xu came out to meet them. The petition representatives Chen Hanting and others presented a written petition with four requests: (1) Forward a letter to the county court, urging them to pay attention to the facts and adjudicate impartially. (2) Issue a notice to all levels of mass organizations to strictly prevent the activities of divisive elements. (3) Petition the higher authorities not to be deceived and to permanently expel Zhang, Yuan, and Qiang from the party. (4) Petition the central government to quickly develop industries and provide relief to unemployed workers. Committee member Xu expressed full acceptance. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Requesting Allocation of U.S. Wheat for Disaster Relief to Assist in Dike Repair The Dike Repair Committee stated that last year's continuous rain caused a disaster, and lake water poured back into the inland rivers, causing the collapse of dikes in various areas. The flooded fields amounted to more than 300,000 mu. The disaster victims were in dire straits, and starvation was pitiful. In order to provide both short-term and long-term relief, a work relief plan was established to repair the dikes in the affected areas. The estimated cost of the project is approximately 300,000 yuan. In addition to raising funds from the Flood Relief Association and presenting a request to the provincial government to allocate 50,000 yuan from the road construction funds, the actual amount is still less than 100,000 yuan, which is insufficient for the project. More than 100,000 disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. Yesterday, a special request was made to General Yu Qia from the National Flood Relief Association to release 30,000 shi of U.S. wheat from the central government loan, so that Wuxi's work relief could proceed. Rong Zongjing and Qian Sunqing were designated to go to Shanghai to negotiate.</p>

<p>Guard Corps Member Flees with Arms The local district offices were ordered last winter to organize a guard corps to defend the local area. Each district has now been established. On the 14th, Zhao Jinwen, a member of the 10th District Guard Corps of Dongtang City in the 3rd District, fled the day before, carrying a Mauser pistol and dozens of bullets. The district chief, Cao Bingxi, fearing that the guard corps member might cause an accident with the weapon, immediately telegraphed the county government, requesting that the county's public security bureaus and guard corps be notified to pay close attention. If anyone is found, they can be handed over to armed agencies for strict handling by the county.</p>
<p>County Government Borrows Grain from Various Business Owners Since the establishment of the new provincial government, funds have been tight, and the counties have been ordered to collect winter tax urgently. This county was assigned 140,000 yuan. However, this year's continuous rain caused a disaster, and the autumn harvest was reduced. Many farmers were holding back, because the rent they received this year was only 20-30% of previous years. As a result, grain taxes were also affected. After receiving the order to remit funds, the county scraped together 60,000 yuan in foreign currency to remit to the province, but there was still a large difference. The provincial government continued to issue repeated orders to urge the county government and the finance bureau to pay up, but they were unable to cope. Wang, the director of the finance bureau, once considered resigning. Now, the Public Association of Taxpayers of Land Property in this county was established. The county government then consulted with the association to ask various business owners to prepay the grain tax, with an interest rate of 1.2% per month. In the future, the borrowed funds could still be used to offset the grain tax. After the land property association passed the resolution, it contacted various parties and borrowed more than 50,000 yuan in cash on the 14th to remit to the province.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Efforts of the Zhejiang Provincial Rural Teachers' School <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Rural Teachers' School, located in Xianghu near Hangzhou, has been making unremitting efforts to improve its internal organization since Principal Huang Tongyi took office. The recent measures are particularly noteworthy, such as "National Crisis Propaganda," "Land Reclamation and Road Construction," "Academic Competitions," "Rural Surveys," "Additional Farmers' Education Centers," "Opening Women's Sewing and Weaving Classes," "Establishing Farmers' Lending Institutions," and "Inspecting Waterborne Diseases and Pests." These efforts have been intense. Some are carried out regularly in the surrounding villages, while others are cultivated and built by teachers and students in sections. As for "Literary Competitions," "Calligraphy and Painting Exhibitions," "Musical Performances," and "Party Principles Speeches," they have all been held in turn. In terms of promotion, special attention is paid to livelihood issues. Women's sewing and weaving training is added to the people's schools to increase income. Work-study programs are implemented in primary schools, with special skilled workers serving as instructors to enhance children's survival skills. In view of the frequent hookworm scourge among villagers, Dr. Hong, a researcher at the Zhejiang Institute of Tropical Diseases and Pests, was hired to come to the countryside to inspect and eliminate the major problem. The teachers and students of the school have been able to cooperate effectively. Huang has been involved in rural education for many years and has always instructed his students to devote themselves to hard work. Therefore, the future plan is to build the school into a large-scale rural academic institution to promote the development of rural schools in Zhejiang Province.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Important Telegram from the Student Union of Various Universities <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲ Urging Wang, Hu, Jiang, and others to jointly face the national crisis</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association issued the following important telegram yesterday regarding the current situation:</p>
<p>▲ Telegram Urging Wang, Hu, and Jiang to Quickly Unite (Salutations omitted) Ever since the violent Japanese invaded and the Northeast fell, our villages have been occupied. This was truly caused by the government's initial mistake of remaining calm, followed by the military's mistake of non-resistance. Now, as we stand at a critical juncture where the nation's survival is at stake, and the people are weary and frightened, it is fortunate that you gentlemen have jointly advocated for peaceful unification, sincere national unity, consistent resistance to external forces, and jointly facing the national crisis. However, upon examination of the facts, this is far from the truth. The so-called peaceful unification and sincere unity still harbor many hidden dangers and lurking obstacles. In terms of resisting external forces, there is no consistency, and in terms of facing the national crisis, where is the joint effort? We believe that you gentlemen have dedicated yourselves to the revolution. Serving the party is serving the country, and serving the country is serving the people. You would certainly not abandon the solemn position of leaders of the 400 million people and instead seek refuge as exiles in foreign lands. Nor would you abandon the lives and property of the 400 million people and disregard the brutal trampling by the enemy. If you wish to maintain the solemn position of leaders of the 400 million people, there is no other way but to save the country and protect the people. We, the students, have witnessed the urgency of the national crisis and the fervent emotions of the people. The situation is critical. We have heard that your attitude is somewhat extreme, delaying your return to the capital, claiming illness and seeking leisure, and showing no concern for the national crisis and the people's suffering. Is this truly your original intention of serving the country and the people? Although we dare not presume to fathom your profound concerns and shifting strategies, in the past, you gentlemen have advocated for the people through involvement in military work, uniting to save the country, or taking responsibility in the private sector. Now, you are acting inconsistently and contradicting yourselves. How will you gain the understanding of the people, and how will you defend yourselves? Moreover, you bear the heavy responsibility of the nation and are at the forefront of the party and the country. Why do you not establish merit before others and speak words that serve as laws for the world? Bearing grudges and violating national interests, alas, you gentlemen are finished. What more can be said? As the saying goes, do not pursue profit dishonestly, and do not avoid harm disgracefully. Upon hearing these two phrases, you should realize that you have no face to meet the people again. You should reflect on yourselves. Having deceived the people in the past and now abandoning them in the future, you should resolve to punish yourselves to appease the people even in the slightest. The ocean of regret is not far off; let your souls yearn for it. The whole country sympathizes and awaits your orders with urgency. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Middle School Student Delegation Returns to Shanghai from Beijing <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sun Ke Gives Detailed Responses on the Current Situation</p>
<p>The delegation of middle school students from this city who went to Beijing to petition has returned after eight days, since their arrival on the 7th. The details of the petition have already been reported in various newspapers. The delegation felt that the current situation was becoming increasingly serious, the rear-area work was strained, and they had a clear understanding of the current state of the government. Although the petition could not achieve satisfactory results, they decided to return with tears in their eyes. They took a fast train from Beijing yesterday morning at 10:00 AM and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. According to reporters from the Guoyu Xinsheng News Agency, in addition to telegraphing back the situation in Beijing from time to time, they also held a reception for news reporters in Beijing the day before yesterday, issuing a circular telegram and declaration on the current situation. That evening, they also sent representatives to the Central Party Headquarters to meet with Sun Ke, inquiring about the government's concrete policies on domestic and foreign affairs. The key points of Sun's response to the petition are as follows: (1) Regarding domestic affairs, first is the government's finances (which have reached the point of utter exhaustion). The government's monthly regular expenses, when offset against revenue, only have a surplus of six million. Just in terms of military expenses, eighteen million is needed each month. Revenue is less than one-third of expenditure. Regarding the suspension of interest payments on government bonds, the government has lost almost all collateral (such as the Financial Public Bonds, the Russian Boxer Indemnity, Customs duties, etc.). Therefore, the general business community in Shanghai insists on opposing it and threatens the government with a strike. These are a minority of money-minded people who sacrifice the country's future, which is extremely heartbreaking. He deeply hopes that the students will express their views on these capitalists after returning to Shanghai. Second, regarding the period before Wang, Jiang, and Hu return to Beijing, a Special Committee has been organized to decide on all major party and national affairs. (2) Regarding foreign affairs, there are currently three possible paths. The first is passive, which is non-resistance to Japan. This is a path of neither life nor death. The second is active, which is to go to war with Japan. However, this will provoke international antipathy because Japan is fighting without a declaration of war, and we do not want to be accused of disrupting world peace and become the public enemy of all nations. The third is severing diplomatic relations, which is a national mobilization to cut off all economic and political ties with Japanese imperialists. This is currently the only and final path. If so, the problem can be expanded to the point of becoming serious and internationalized, thus arousing international sympathy. Through this, we can use the power of foreigners to recover lost territories in the Northeast, just as the Washington Conference led to the recovery of Qingdao. Finally, the representatives asked that, given that China is in a situation where the various imperialist powers are dividing it up, and our government has no fundamental solutions and is only talking about severing diplomatic relations with Japan, what will we do about those who are attacking China? Sun replied that one solution can solve everything, and there is no need to worry. We can adopt international diplomatic means to disperse the imperialist powers' attacks. He also firmly stated that if this path does not work, he would simply resign and yield to someone more capable.</p>

They elected Shen Siliang as the chairman of the board of directors and discussed the appointment of professors, the examination of new students, and the issue of admitting female students. The meeting lasted for two hours. Because many students' families and female students from various places sent letters or directly requested the school to establish a women's department to cultivate female physical education talents, this matter was specially raised for discussion. After repeated research, they maintained their original position of not admitting female students this semester and focusing on absolutely strict training for male students.</p>

<p>丨Hong Kong South China Team to Philippines This Month丨</p>
<p>丨Guangzhou Naval, Air, and Police Prepare to Come North丨</p>
<p>The Hong Kong China United Team's visit to Shanghai has been rumored for some time. However, according to Mr. Zhang Zheng, who is familiar with the sports situation in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong South China Team plans to go to the Philippines on the 24th of this month and will be hard-pressed to go north. However, the three Guangzhou Naval, Air, and Police forces are making preparations to form a joint team to visit Shanghai. The Westerners' Association announced on December 8 that there would be a match between the Hong Kong Inter-Port United Team and the Shanghai Hong Kong Chinese United Team. The so-called Hong Kong Chinese athletes may refer to the members of the Guangzhou Naval, Air, and Police Joint Team. How it will turn out remains to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Malayan Borrowed Players to Play Against Inter-Port Team Tomorrow <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ Inner Guards Li Ning and Feng Yunyou</p>
<p>▲ Center Guards Tu Kaiyuan and Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>The Malayan team has lost all three matches since arriving in Shanghai, but their individual strengths are commendable. The only problem is that the whole team lacks soundness and cannot be evenly consistent. Therefore, for tomorrow's match against the Shanghai Inter-Port team, it has been decided to borrow generals from Dunghua and Jinan to prepare for a decisive battle. It has now been internally determined to invite Dunghua's Li Tingyong and Jinan's Feng Yunyou to succeed as inner guards, and Dunghua's Tu Kaiyuan and Chen Jiaqiu as center guards.</p>

<p>▲ Only One Point Behind Leader Lincoln</p>
<p>The first round of the Westerners' Football Association's group leagues has mostly ended, and the second round is about to begin. The results of the matches will determine the outcome. The association officially released the latest team results yesterday. A record of this is shown below with a brief explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jinan Hopes for Group A Championship <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Lincoln, Jinan, and West Prison are three strong teams. Lincoln and Jinan have each played eight games, with one getting twelve points and the other getting eleven points. Jinan is one point behind, so defeating Lincoln will allow Jinan to jump to the lead. West Prison has eleven points in nine games, and is two points behind Jinan. If Jinan can maintain a winning streak in the future, the championship is in sight.</p>
<h3 id="e122">St. John's and Hujiang Lose in Group B <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Group B has a total of sixteen teams, with only St. John's and Hujiang being Chinese teams. St. John's has played eight games, winning four and losing four, getting eight points.

<h3 id="e127">Creating the Chinese Nation in the Midst of Creation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese nation was not originally created successfully. The mission of creating the Chinese nation rests in the hands of modern Chinese people.</p>
<p>The formation of a nation seems to go through three stages:</p>
<p>The first stage: Each tribe acts for its own benefit.</p>
<p>The second stage: Each tribe helps each other.</p>
<p>The third stage: Each tribe unites as one and stands on a single front to face a common enemy.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign invasion is the only touchstone for a nation. If we want to know whether a nation has been created successfully, we only need to observe its reaction when foreign invasion strikes, and everything will become clear at a glance.</p>
<p>What stage has the modern Chinese nation reached in its creation? Is it evolution or regression? In my observation, the Chinese nation has already reached the second stage. If it were not for the obstacles of warlords, it could immediately jump to the third stage.</p>
<p>At the time of the Ming Dynasty's downfall, the majority of the Chinese nation was still lingering in the first stage. When Beijing fell, Nanjing remained a bystander. At the Yangzhou and Jiading massacres, people from other places stood by and did not offer rescue. The Ming Dynasty therefore fell.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai, someone initiated assistance to the Northeast Volunteer Army, and last time, people from the Southeast raised donations to help the Heilongjiang Army resist Japan. These are all important facts in the history of the Chinese nation's development. These events prove that the Chinese nation has developed to the second stage. This time, the assistance to the Northeast Volunteer Army is even more significant because the Northeast Volunteer Army is purely the people's military force, which displays the true national spirit. People of the same ethnicity in various places helping each other with real strength is definitely a step further than empty sympathy.</p>
<p>However, we cannot linger in this stage, thinking that donating some money to help the Northeast Volunteer Army is enough to fulfill our responsibilities. The formation of a nation must involve unity in action. The people of the whole country must unite and stand on a single front with the Northeast Volunteer Army to struggle. Only then can the great mission of creating the Chinese nation be completed.</p>
<p>The non-resisting warlords are sinking in the lowest layer of the first stage. In their minds, there is only their personal wealth and family; where is the nation? Therefore, non-resisting warlords betray the national spirit, which means betraying the Republic of China. The people of the whole country should immediately rise up and stand on a single front with the Northeast Volunteer Army to eliminate the separatist warlords, drive out the tyrannical Japanese army, and restore the lost territorial sovereignty, so as to complete the great mission of creating the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Anecdotes of Shen Peizhen <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Yao</p>
<p>Shen Peizhen was from Hunan province. She was an old pioneer in the women's revolutionary movement, a fellow townsman of Huang Keqiang, hence she was hailed as a heroine. She was already famous in the early years of the Republic. Her appearance was not strikingly beautiful, but her manner was natural and unrestrained. Usually, she was rather introverted and rarely smiled, but during political discussions, she would often slam the table and stand up, her loud voice shaking the roof tiles. Even male figures dared not argue with her, some even becoming speechless. It's clear she was not like the demure, smiling women of today.</p>
<p>After the Xuantong Emperor abdicated, Wang Zhaoming and Hu Ying were released from prison. Hu, named Jingwu, was also from Hunan. Initially, he became acquainted with two women while in prison. Afterwards, he married them, with Song Jiaoren as the officiant. This was widely circulated as a romantic tale, and various newspapers in Beijing praised it. However, Shen, upon hearing this, believed it damaged the dignity of women. She went directly to the wedding venue, confronted Song, and slapped his face with her palm, making a resounding noise. It became a laughingstock. But Song ultimately could do nothing to Shen and could only endure it. Later, some people said that Song's ambition to be in charge of industrial affairs never came to fruition was due to the force of this one slap.</p>
<p>Later, a member of the Guangdong Tongmenghui, Ye Xiasheng, pointed out that Hu had married two women and held the weddings on the same day, making them equal wives. He cited the "crime of bigamy. Whether according to the old or new laws, there are specific clauses. A man with multiple wives is a disgrace to civilized countries. Yet Hu Ying, a founding member of the Republic, should set an example with his every action. He openly committed bigamy in the capital, in a prominent area where foreigners could see, blatantly violating the law. From the President (at the time Yuan Shikai) down to the people of the whole country, no one seemed to notice his violation and offer any admonishment. Instead, various circles congratulated him and held banquets. What of the national law? What of human morality? What will foreigners think of our laughter and criticism?" He submitted a letter to the Beijing press association warning about this situation. Although the letter bore Ye's name, it was actually Shen who prompted it to help her speak out.</p>
<p>When Li Yuanhong became President, Shen was still lingering in Beijing. It was rumored that she went directly to the Presidential Palace naked to request a meeting. Huang Pi, fearing this, refused her. She insisted on requesting an audience, and he had no choice but to see her. She wore a large cloak, and her manner was composed. It was unexpected that she would ask for something. Moreover, it was an excessive amount, which he could not possibly provide. Shen then flung open her cloak, intending to harass him. Huang Pi was extremely embarrassed and immediately gave her 20,000 taels of gold. Only then did Shen leave. A certain member of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly was seeking intimacy with her, but there was no prospect of marriage. One day, she sued him in court, claiming that he always engaged in fleeting affairs during his travels. The member had no way to resist and settled by paying an enormous sum. And so it ended. Alas, Shen was truly an extraordinary figure among women. However, in the early years of the Republic, she also organized a women's Northern Expedition army, gaining considerable reputation. She was on par with Lin Zongsu in fame. Unexpectedly, she has now passed away in Shanghai. The one who once scolded like an oriole and berated like a swallow has suddenly ridden a phoenix to the paradise of immortality, never to return.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A Large Number of Pets Owned by a Woman. Miss Beat Rice Harrigon, a famous British bass viola player, amazed and delighted the public with her singing nightingales. Most interestingly, she kept a large number of pets at home. She had all kinds of birds and beasts. She had twenty-four dogs, two short-snouted crocodiles, one monkey, one Moor hen, five parrots, twenty-eight goldfish, two mules, twenty-five budgerigars, thirty-two pigeons, twenty-four canaries, two Australian crested doves, and several other rare and precious birds. They were all her good companions in daily life. The monkey, named Jane, could dance and had good posture. One of the parrots could sing the famous song "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." One of the dogs could also bark out tunes, which was very pleasant to hear. These many pets, under her training, all had an ear for music and loved to listen to their mistress play her bass viola.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Patriotic Zeal of Ninety-Three Eighty-Six <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Guo</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a ninety-three-year-old elder, published his suggestions for overcoming difficulties on the day Liaoning and Jilin were lost. His loyal advice to our compatriots across the country was filled with tearful words and penetrating insights. Later, his letter to students, as disclosed in the newspapers, provided much guidance for the patriotic movement of young people. His moral character and writing are probably already well-known throughout the country, so there is no need for me, the reporter, to say more. However, things in the world often come in pairs. At this moment when the enemy's horses and barbarian tunes are shaking the world, the people of our country have risen up in struggle for survival amidst worry and fear. The fervor of the people's movement has led to many extraordinary deeds and strange stories that the average person may not know. I will present one such instance to show that the spirit of the people cannot be insulted. Who says there is no one in China?</p>
<p>Qiu Gongluanxie is from Xiangyin in Hunan. He was gifted from a young age and had a revolutionary nature. In the first year of the Republic, he was commissioned by Mr. Huang Keqiang to go to Tongzhou to declare independence. On the way, he was arrested by the water police and imprisoned for five years. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, during the wars in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, he was again instructed by Sun Yat-sen to serve as the commander-in-chief of the punitive expedition against Qi. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, before the revolutionary army arrived in Shanghai, Qiu had already recruited a civilian army and engaged in fierce battles with Bi Shucheng's troops in the Baoshan Road area for a day and a night, forcing Bi's troops to retreat. Qiu then retired after achieving his goal, with no thoughts of personal gain or reward. He usually supported himself by selling his calligraphy. If anyone requested it, he would wield his brush for them without regard to the value of the work. His calligraphy was vigorous, mature, and elegant, and those leaders of the party and government who obtained it often regarded it as a treasure. Now, with the invasion by the Japanese devils, Qiu, at the age of eighty-six, did not spare his declining years and ran around shouting, his feet never stopping. He organized the Retired Soldiers Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army of the Republic of China, seeking to fight with blood and iron for the survival of the nation. He was elected by the people as the army commander. It is said that the headquarters is currently located at the Hunan Guildhall in Xieqiao. His subordinates number around fifty to sixty thousand, all of whom have experienced battles and served in the military for a long time. They do not need training and can immediately march to the front lines. There are also quite a few guns and bullets. It is said that after Qiu organized the volunteer army, various representatives were sent to Shanghai to discuss everything. The arrangements have now been completed, and they plan to concentrate their forces in the near future and advance to the front lines, vowing to fight to the death against the Japanese invaders. They would rather die for the country than live in humiliation. Qiu, though old, is becoming stronger and will personally go to the front lines to direct everything. Such majestic spirit and firm integrity are greatly to the glory of our country. What are the thoughts of us young people upon hearing this? (No payment accepted)</p>
<p>▲ Brief News: The famous novelist Wang Zhusheng recently celebrated the birth of a daughter. When his wife was first pregnant, she suffered severe abdominal pain. Fortunately, through a friend's introduction, she sought the medical care of Dr. Fang Shenhe, a renowned acupuncturist from Hele Lane on Xinzha Road. With his devoted acupuncture treatment, the pregnancy was stabilized and the illness cured. It is said that Dr. Fang has cured countless dangerous and serious illnesses. For example, consumption and dropsy are among the most serious and difficult diseases to treat. Among the most dangerous situations is when pregnant women contract severe illnesses. Because it is necessary to treat the illness while protecting the fetus, Dr. Fang once used acupuncture on a pregnant woman named Dai who was seven months pregnant and suffering from appendicitis. She was experiencing excruciating abdominal pain. Dr. Fang first performed surgery to move the fetus, and then applied acupuncture to specific points to stop the pain. He then carefully repositioned the fetus to its original location. Soon after, the illness was cured, and she safely gave birth to a son. Those who heard about this were amazed by his divine skills.

<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Wang Naizheng</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic, Yuan Shikai transformed from a key minister of the Qing Dynasty into the head of state. For a time, many upright and virtuous officials of the previous dynasty, one after another, demeaned themselves by serving in the new court, too numerous to count after Xu Shichang. One could hardly find anyone who refused to eat the millet and beans of the new government. However, Wang Naizheng was worthy of praise for preserving his integrity and setting a good example. Naizheng, courtesy name Ping San, later styled himself as Bing Shan (Sick Mountain). He was from Zhongjiang in Sichuan. After passing the imperial examination and entering the Hanlin Academy, he became a supervising censor. His forthright criticism was renowned throughout the country. In those days, few of the noble officials who were impeached by him were not shocked. During the late Qing Dynasty, the censors mostly engaged in perfunctory tasks, using official banquets and drinking to discuss matters. They would often pick up on trivial matters and write about them in their memorials, indulging in momentary satisfaction. Those who were impeached would all use their connections to turn major matters into minor ones and minor ones into nothing at all. Naizheng, however, was different. He would not bring up matters unless they were truly substantial, nor would he impeach people unless they were truly corrupt. Therefore, people feared him. Later, the sensational exposé by the "Three Lin Company" was not without borrowing from Naizheng's tactics. The "Three Lin" were Jiang Chunlin from Fujian, Zhao Qilin from Sichuan, and Zhao Binglin from Hunan. Lin and Lin are homophones, hence the name "Three Lin Company." Since Naizheng was known for his bold speaking, the people in the Grand Council especially disliked him. Yikuang once said to someone, "Ping San makes things difficult for us in every matter. When the opportunity arises, we must send him to an outside post to avoid trouble." Therefore, he was appointed as the prefect of Fuzhou Prefecture in Jiangxi. During his three years in office, he did not take a single penny. As a result, he was widely praised. Although local officials repeatedly recommended him for his talent, he only received commendations that were recorded but not substantially used. When Puyi ascended the throne at a young age, Zaifeng served as the regent on behalf of his young son. He immediately promoted Naizheng to be the intendant of the Changzhen Circuit in Hunan, then the Surveillance Commissioner of Jiangxi. He did not take office there, but was instead appointed as the Prefect of Shuntian Prefecture. Soon after assuming office, he was transferred to be the Financial Commissioner of Henan and then to Hubei. At that time, the governor of Hubei, Chen Kuilong, was transferred to Beiyang, and the successor governor, Rui Cheng, was still serving as the governor of Jiangsu. An official order appointed Naizheng to concurrently manage the affairs of the Governor-General of Huguang, while simultaneously holding the office of prefect. This all happened in less than a year. The speed of his promotion was unparalleled in the late Qing Dynasty. This was because Naizheng had once tutored Zaifeng. Zaifeng had always known of his virtue. Once he took power, he promoted him five ranks in one year. The repayment of his patronage could be said to have been complete. After Rui Cheng arrived in Hubei, Naizheng returned to his position as financial commissioner. Because Cheng was arrogant and unaccommodating, they could not get along. Zaifeng heard about this and planned to bring him into the central government. Someone stopped him. Therefore, he was transferred to Guizhou. The path was remote and the position was barren. At first, it was thought that Naizheng might not want to go. However, he received confirmation that he was already on his way. This further confirmed that he was not a person who chose the most lucrative opportunities. If the Qing dynasty had lasted longer, Naizheng would surely have become a prime minister. However, the third year of Xuantong marked the end of the dynasty. Returning from the border, he passed through Shanghai by land and settled there. He was very poor and called himself the Qian Dao Ren (Reclusive Taoist). He became a doctor, living in seclusion. In recent years, he has grown even older and his circumstances have become even more difficult. However, he remains steadfast in upholding his integrity as before. Comparing him to the ancients, he is like Wang Wan.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Jesting with Her Good Tutor, A Terrible Report Arrives; Her Home Meets Disaster, Pitying a Friend in Solitude; A Spring Atmosphere Comes to Life in the Inn.</p>
<p>It turned out that her boudoir was arranged in a row of north-facing upper rooms, totaling three large rooms. The easternmost room was her bedroom, which ordinary people could not casually enter. The middle room served as a small guest room. Any guests who could be invited to the upper room had to first step into this room. The westernmost room was her study. It was decorated with extreme elegance. The walls were hung with calligraphy and paintings by famous people. A rosewood desk was placed by the window, with exquisite stationery on top. Next to it was a row of glass bookcases, sparsely filled with thread-bound books in cloth cases and Western-style books with gilded leather covers. The chairs, couches, and tea tables were all Western-style furniture made of rosewood. There were also a few antique items displayed, giving the room a refined feel. After entering the study, she went directly to a swivel chair in front of the desk and sat down. Her petite body seemed too tired to sit upright, shrinking into a ball and sinking deeply into the chair. Then, she casually pointed to another chair beside her and smiled unnaturally, saying, "Please sit, teacher. It's time for the lesson." Wei Zhuomou responded with a couple of "Yes, yes" sounds, busying himself by first finding the English textbook that she read daily from the desk. He opened it and found the page that was supposed to be continued, carefully placing it in front of her. Then, he also opened the Western-style book he had brought and placed it in front of him, before sitting down next to her. He pointed at the book and taught her to read, sentence by sentence. Unexpectedly, she was listless and acted strangely. Her eyes, which were usually lively, did not look at the book, nor did they look at the teacher's walrus mustache. Instead, they seemed like a pair of gemstones that had lost their luster, embedded in her eye sockets, as if she was staring blankly at something or lost in thought. It was so quiet that there was not a single sound. He could not see her lips moving as she followed the teacher's mumbling recitation. Wei Zhuomou, seeing that her expression was not right and unwilling to waste his effort, smiled and said, "What did I say? I said you weren't in the mood today, so we shouldn't have the lesson. But you insisted. Isn't it a waste now? You can't even read half a sentence." Liang Xiaoyun, after being said by Wei Zhuomou, also felt bored. She casually swept her hand across the book, making a "thud" sound as she knocked it off the desk and onto the carpet at her feet. She blinked her eyes, pursed her lips, and said in a spoiled tone, "I certainly wasn't in the mood to read. But you also don't seem to be willing to patiently teach me. Let's just forget it." Wei Zhuomou quickly bent down to pick it up for her, and still said with a smile, "Young lady, don't get angry. It's all my fault as the teacher. I don't know how to coax my student to read. Now it's too late to think of a way to coax you. Let's just forget it. Let's chat about something else. Or, I'll tell you a story or a joke to cheer you up." Liang Xiaoyun suddenly turned her face away and said, "I don't want to hear anything."</p>

<h3 id="e133">Financial Gold Price Decline Intensifies <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲ The plunge of more than eleven taels is dramatic. The gold price fell more severely yesterday, the waves were raging and unstoppable. In the morning and midday, it hovered around six hundred and eighty taels, the market was so weak that it had broken into six hundred and seventy taels. There were sixteen taels throughout the day. People were unusually frightened, and finally the price dropped sharply by more than eleven taels. The opening was slightly down, although the silver price reported an increase, the large bars rose but not by much, so there was no particular impact. After that, the fluctuations were erratic, and the buying and selling of peers varied greatly. Although the foreign exchange rate of British and American currencies soared, the British gold should have been tight, but the US dollar was not loose. In the afternoon, it was suddenly heard that the settlement case mentioned in foreign telegrams may be resolved at a meeting soon, and that Citibank may have cash flowing out. In addition, the February to March term has already begun one day in advance, and the discount is only a little more than four taels, then three taels zero, and then increased to about four taels. Still, the short sellers posted it, and many people traded, so with various reasons caused the price to fall sharply by more than ten taels, the selling was active from all parties, and the long positions were sold off, almost making the drafts more loose.</p>
<p>▲ The morning market fluctuated erratically, opening slightly lower by one tael and six qian, at six hundred and seventy-seven taels. Although the large bars rose by one-eighth, the US silver rose by one-half, and the private telegrams added eleven-sixteenths, the people's minds were still at peace, so it rose to eighty taels. Later, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, etc. came to sell, so it fell to six hundred and seventy-six taels. However, the drafts were still at peace, and the banks mutually did three-month British gold at one shilling eleven pence two five, and also bought four-month US dollars at thirty-three and a half yuan, so it returned up two taels. When the British gold was announced, it was six hundred and seventy-eight taels five, the list price was not changed, and the US dollar was increased by half a yuan, but it was a flat exchange rate, which had no impact, only a small five qian, at six hundred and seventy-eight taels. Afterwards, because Mitsui absorbed thirty-three and a half yuan of US dollars internally, it was increased to six hundred and seventy-nine taels. Later, four months required thirty-three yuan five six two five, and the sellers were active, so at ten o'clock it was again seen at six hundred and seventy-six taels. Since then, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, Zhifengshui, Hongkangyong, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, etc. have come to buy, and the exchange rate has turned better, and the banks have collected thirty-three and a half yuan for four-month US dollars and one shilling eleven pence zero six two five for five months, causing the gold price to jump up and cross the six hundred and eighty tael mark, until eleven o'clock at six hundred and eighty-two taels and two qian, of which no more than one tael and more was prosperous, and later Hengxing, Dadecheng, Hongkangyong Zhifengyong, etc. came to sell, the minds of the people seemed to soften, and they retreated four taels, at eleven fifty at six hundred and seventy-eight taels and four qian. From time to time, retail households bought in, and the market closed at noon at six hundred and seventy-nine taels and eight qian. The price was estimated to be fifty taels or so, and the list price had increased by half a yuan, changed to seven hundred and twenty-seven taels.</p>
<p>▲ News is tight. The market fell straight down. The after-market opened and fell to six hundred and seventy-four taels and five qian because Dalian gang sold according to the list price, and then increased to six hundred and seventy-seven taels and a half because Dalian gang resold, but the term exchange has suddenly opened privately, and the discount must be large, especially because foreign telegrams reported that the United States had cash outflows, so the people's minds were greatly shocked and sellers were overbearing. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng items, etc. were sold in large quantities, and the US dollar frequency was loose, and the bank reached thirty-three yuan eight seven five, so the price plummeted, at three fifteen to six hundred and sixty-seven taels and three qian, Hengxing Shunli came to buy, and pulled up more than two taels, at three thirty to six hundred and sixty-nine taels and eight qian. Zhifengyong, Yifeng, Dechengyong selling was more aware, still down more than three taels, at four o'clock the pawn was six hundred and sixty-six taels and two qian, in a moment the pawn rose two taels, because HSBC absorbed thirty-three yuan nine three seven five US dollars in April, so it increased to six hundred and sixty-nine taels and one qian, so like Yifeng etc. still sell non-stop, until four thirty the market closed at six hundred and sixty-seven taels and three qian, down another eleven taels and three qian from the day before, and then re-did to six hundred and sixty-seven eight taels, according to the four days of decline for a long time, a total of twenty-nine taels and zero, yesterday morning big six hundred and eighty-two taels and two qian smallest six hundred and sixty-six taels and two qian, calculated to have sixteen taels of ups and downs, items early market six hundred and seventy-seven taels, noon closed six hundred and seventy-eight taels and a half, afternoon six hundred and seventy-five taels and five, closed six hundred and sixty-seven taels and a half, the price is estimated to lift fifty taels to sixty taels, the account before the market six hundred and eighty-two taels to eighty taels, the after-market six hundred and sixty-nine taels to sixty-seven taels, make up water six hundred and eighty-two taels afternoon six hundred and sixty-nine taels, the naked bar is calculated to add nine taels and a half to ten taels, buyers are endless.</p>
<p>▲ Transactions in the market are heated. There are many transactions on the surface. According to statistics, both Dachengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, and Fuchangyuan, Yuan are buying in.

<p>▲ No Transactions Yesterday or the Day Before</p>
<p>▲ Market Closure Likely to Continue Today</p>
<p>For the past two days, Wednesday and Thursday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and brokers, concerned that the overall situation would cause prices to continue to fall, decided to only settle transactions, and then decided to suspend all transactions. Therefore, there were no transactions in those two days. The exchange held an emergency meeting the night before last to discuss solutions, deciding to await orders from the Ministry of Finance before reopening. However, brokers, seeing little chance of improvement in the current situation, convened a meeting yesterday morning and decided to extend the market closure for another two days, hoping for a better overall situation. As a result, the market remained closed yesterday, and it is feared that trading will still be difficult today. The situation will be observed again at the beginning of next week, and a decision will be made on whether to resume trading based on the intentions of the Ministry of Finance and the financial industry. The market outlook is not optimistic. All parties are levying taxes, and the Ministry of Finance is suspending payment of principal and interest on bonds. Although the news still needs to be confirmed, public anxiety has reached its peak. The banking industry, with its close ties, is deeply anxious, and other industries are also seeking support, hoping that the government will consider the difficulties of businesses, properly plan relief measures, and reassure the people, lest the future becomes more severe and the foundation of the nation is shaken.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Cotton Yarn Market Color Dim <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is lackluster and the situation is softening due to the deteriorating environment and the securities market shutdown, leading to weakened confidence and retail investors dumping their holdings. However, the underlying support is very thin. The Sichuan guild's actual sales are still relatively smooth, with many purchases of February and March futures, so the mills are relatively firm.</p>
<p>▲ People's Standard Flat. The People's Standard market opened with a slight increase in American cotton, but market sentiment was weak, with near-term contracts up one cent and far-term contracts flat. In the afternoon, near-term contracts rose two cents and far-term contracts fell one or two cents. The total volume for the day was 5,500 bales. Sales included 400 bales from Sen Kang, 350 bales from Ming De, and 200 bales from Tai Xing. Purchases included 400 bales from Hou Feng, 350 bales from Yi Chang, and 250 bales from Yuan De, with the remainder being 250 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market is showing signs of weakness, but American cotton prices are still flat. Although the political unrest in India is fierce, the lack of arrivals and high prices of foreign firms make it difficult to lower prices, keeping sentiment flat. Although Japanese merchants are entrusting Indian merchants to take delivery of goods this month, rumors of short sellers delivering 5,000 to 6,000 piculs of Tonghua cotton have caused the market to soften again. However, Shenxin Mill is settling the prices of some Indian cotton and has been purchasing some local cotton recently, according to sources.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Slightly Down One or Two Cents. The Han Standard market opened flat, with slight weakness in the second and third sessions, falling by five fen.

<p>▲ Sources in Southern Shanghai yesterday exceeded twenty, and rural and urban transactions became active. Due to unfavorable weather and weakened confidence, thick japonica rice prices temporarily remained at the opening levels. Arrivals of early and late rice were limited, and the appetite remained thin. Street sales were brisk, with prices rising slightly. Yanglu tip rice showed signs of fatigue, presenting a weakening trend. Wine appetite was strong, and prices rose nearly a dime.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday was the day for the Rice Industry Association in the City Temple of Xinzha to measure the capacity of rice measures, so transactions were not very active. Top-grade thick japonica rice prices remained the same as the previous market, with secondary grades rising nearly a dime. Some hoarders of early and late rice slightly increased their holdings, by about 2,000 piculs, and prices jumped by two or three dimes. Du tip rice showed signs of fatigue, with no price increases or decreases. Glutinous rice appetite was weak and the situation was tired. Rice merchants in the Hexia area had about 4,600 piculs in stock.</p>

<p>▲ Inquiries from Hankou and Northern Markets</p>
<p>▲ Better Appetite in Local Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot sales of foreign rice were very good. In addition to brisk sales in the local market, there were also inquiries from Yantai and Tianjin in the north, as well as retail buyers and buyers from Hankou, resulting in very good market sentiment. Prices also slightly improved. The unified market opened with 8,000 bags of Xiaojiao imported rice at 9.50 to 9.45 yuan, and 7,000 bags of Zhuan Kou Baisheng Xiaojiao at 9.60 yuan. The imported rice was purchased by local merchants, while the Zhuan Kou rice was destined for northern markets and the Yangtze River.

<p>▲ Many Parties Preparing for the New Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally stable. Long positions were preparing for the New Year and had no intention of making changes. Although short positions intended to sell, there were very few buyers, making it difficult to sell smoothly. It was heard that a certain factory had ordered another ship of Australian wheat at 3.65 taels. There were also rumors that anti-Japanese efforts had become lax, and many Japanese merchants were active. It is necessary for flour factories to show conscience to avoid being criticized for their lack of patriotism. As a result, this month was down 0.0025 taels compared to the previous day, February was up 0.025 taels, March and April were down 0.005 taels, May was unchanged, and June was up 0.005 taels.</p>

<p>▲ Mostly Liquidation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally fluctuated. This month, due to the silence in futures, the market turned flat. February, March, and April saw more trading, but mostly liquidation. Although there were still transactions in Yang wheat, market values were extremely low and sentiment inevitably turned stable. In May and June, due to fewer sellers, the market was firm. As a result, this month was down 0.02 taels compared to the previous day, February, March, and April were unchanged, May was up 0.01 taels, and June was up 0.03 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's news from producing areas showed Cuban spot sugar prices remaining at 1.15625, New York sugar futures at 1.07 for March, 1.08 for May, 1.19 for September, and 1.25 for October, each down 0.02 compared to previous reports. Java spot and futures sugar prices remained unchanged. In the local association market, transactions were quiet. Dutch No. 24 raw sand sugar was priced at 9.50 taels in the initial market, but buying interest was limited. Sales were scarce, with prices rising to 9.525 taels after more than a thousand lots traded, and the trend was stable. Fine sand white sugar was priced at 9.60 taels, and medium sand white sugar at 9.50 taels, and the market situation was also stable. The arrival of Taikoo Sugar B Mark sugar caused a sudden setback in the market, with prices falling to 11.90 taels. M Mark was priced at 11.45 taels, and HX Mark at 10.75 taels. Due to the limited supply, the market was quite lively. Huasheng's domestic Huanggang Qing sugar continued to be offered at 7.90 taels, and Mianhu red sugar at 11.23 taels, with various packages also opened, resulting in a flat market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market remained dull and lifeless. Due to the lack of activity in New York and Lyon silk sales and a lack of silk news, both Chinese and foreign silk merchants adopted a passive attitude. Only Anqi purchased 10 bales of Bai Qian, and Samsung purchased 12 bales of Huang coarse silk, with prices flat and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, the French firms continued to need Zhenmei green tea from Lailu Village, so the market was not deserted. However, due to the low prices from abroad, the market could not stabilize. Yesterday, special Rui Zhenmei was priced at 125 taels, which was three or four taels lower than before. Yihua and Tongfu and other native firms also slightly increased their purchases of Zhenmei tea, but selling prices also showed declines without increases.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of Huate woollen fabric have turned clear, and it has become difficult to sell off existing inventory. In addition, new goods are being imported at cheaper prices, so sellers are voluntarily reducing prices in the hope of selling their goods beforehand. Therefore, plain, mixed, sandwiched, shimmering, checkered, and twill woollens are now falling in price, with an average decrease of 0.10 to 0.40 taels per yard. Those with whole boxes or several pieces of appetite are willing to make concessions. Yesterday, Deji Fongshenbang assorted plain Huate woollens were reduced to 4.40 taels, Ningfeng No. 1 was 3.90 taels, No. 2 was 3.50 taels, Lulin was 4.125 taels, Tianxiang Baoda lamp was 3.80 taels, and checkered was 3.55 taels.

<p>Recently, Kaiping lump coal supplies have been interrupted, and spot supplies of various No. 3 bituminous lump coal are also scarce in the market, so Jiawang screened lump coal sales have been good, with about 100 tons being traded daily. As a result, the selling price is firm, requiring about 12 taels per ton. Although sales of Tong coal and coal dust are not as good as lump coal, the market price is also very stable, with Tong coal currently selling for 10.06 taels per ton and coal dust for 8.50 taels.</p>

<p>▲ Negotiations Result in a Satisfactory Outcome</p>
<p>▲ Unanimous Expression of Support for the Government</p>
<p>▲ Both Sides to Continue Discussions Today</p>
<p>Since the central government proposed suspending payment of principal and interest on public bonds, which aroused strong opposition from all sectors, the National Government has decided to withdraw the proposal and sent Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to Shanghai to explain and negotiate financial issues. Wu arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Yesterday afternoon at 3:15 PM, Wu personally consulted with representatives of the financial community at the Bankers' Association, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. The result was satisfactory, and the representatives all expressed their willingness to do their best to support the government through this financial crisis. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Representatives Present <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Due to the public debt issue, various sectors have held repeated meetings in recent days. The night before last, after learning that the central government had sent Wu Tiecheng to Shanghai for consultations, they also selected seven representatives to be responsible for contacting Wu. The seven representatives were Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin. The central government was represented by Wu Tiecheng and Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau. All attended the meeting at the Bankers' Association at 3:15 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Contents of the Deliberations <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Wu Tiecheng first reported that the central government had established a Special Committee of the Central Political Council, with the number of members increased from nine to fifteen. This is a small group organization under the Central Political Council. The event of suspending payment of principal and interest on public bonds was only one of the proposals. Later, due to the spread of the news, it caused special panic in all parties. Most members of the Central Political Council also expressed opposition to this proposal, and the proposal was never established. Therefore, it is not really a problem. No matter what, the government will not resort to this measure. Please, representatives, relax. However, the central government's finances have reached a dead end. Please find ways to maintain the financial community to overcome this difficulty. Currently, the central government's military expenditures are at least 16 million yuan per month, and political expenditures are 2 million yuan, totaling 18 million yuan. On the revenue side, if the provinces do not deduct taxes, then 7 million yuan can be collected per month. The difference between income and expenditure is 11 million yuan, which should be assisted by the financial community for one month. The representatives stated that they could accept the principle of assisting the government proposed by Wu, but the amount of 11 million yuan was too large. It is now approaching the Lunar New Year and there is no guarantee. After detailed discussions between the two parties, it was decided that Wu would immediately telegraph Nanjing for further reduction. On the one hand, various public groups will convene another meeting last night to determine the exact amount that can be assisted by the government each month. After both parties have the results, we will discuss it again today. The representatives unanimously stated at the meeting that they would try to maintain the government no matter what. At the same time, Wu Tiecheng also said that finances would be completely open in the future and the people would have the right to supervise. In the future, all major central government policies will be presided over by the National Crisis Committee, which will recruit talents from all over the country, with about 80 members, and so on. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wu Tiecheng's Remarks <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting, reporters inquired with Wu Tiecheng about the negotiations and other matters. Wu replied, and his remarks are recorded as follows: I (Wu referring to himself) went to Nanjing the other day to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting. Today, I came to Shanghai to consult with representatives of various public groups in the city on financial issues. The results of the talks can be said to be smooth. There have been rumors outside in recent days of panic that the government will suspend payment of principal and interest on public bonds, but although the government's finances have reached a dead end, it will ultimately not implement this proposal to cut off the lifeline of the national economy. This kind of news is only a minority proposal. The government did not pass it. Currently, in order to alleviate financial difficulties, I am consulting with representatives of various public groups to jointly maintain the overall situation. Today, I exchanged opinions with everyone and the results were very good. The representatives are also very willing to do their best to maintain the government, and the government is also very clear about the difficulties of the financial community. I just hope that everyone can help each other. Wu also responded to reporters' inquiries by saying that when I was in Nanjing, President Sun (Ke) told me (Wu referring to himself) that he would take the train to Hangzhou today (yesterday) to meet with Chiang to urge him to return to Nanjing. However, I am still unsure whether President Sun will go to Hangzhou today. He also said that the tax revenues in Guangdong have not been cut off and are still preserved in Guangdong and can be handed over to the central government. Zhang Hanqing (Xueliang) in North China has also not cut off tax revenues. I will not return to Nanjing immediately today. I plan to telegraph the results of the consultations to the central government and then consult with the representatives of various public groups in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Regarding the selection of a successor to the Minister of Finance, the government initially considered Chen Mingshu. However, according to news from the banking community yesterday, the government quite intended to ask the financial community to recommend a successor. However, the financial community stated that they unanimously opposed Chen Mingshu as the chief financial officer. Other successor candidates are at the discretion of the government and are not to be questioned.</p>

<p>▲ Hoping Not to Strike, Boycott, or Suspend Studies</p>
<p>Member of the Central Committee Wu Tiecheng stated to reporters yesterday that at this time of national crisis, Mr. Sun Zhesheng has the determination to sacrifice and take office as the President of the Executive Yuan to deal with the national crisis. Although Mr. Jiang Wang Hu and others failed to come to Nanjing to share the difficulties, they all expressed their support for Mr. Sun, stabilized the central government. The people and the government are closely related. I hope all parties will trust the government and support the government. Recently, I have heard that Shanghai is brewing strikes, boycotts, and school suspensions to coerce the government to declare war on Japan as soon as possible and recover the lost territories of the Eastern Provinces by force. Although this expression comes from the people's sincere patriotism, at this time of serious diplomacy and financial difficulties, all parties should support the government and urge the government to give full support to deal with and overcome these difficulties and seek solutions to diplomatic and financial problems. This plan will only make the government more difficult and will seriously hit the Shanghai market. As the head of Shanghai Municipality, I bear the responsibility for public order in the city, and I have to give good advice on these attempts, hoping that all sectors will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Decides to Follow the Wishes of Its Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a request from the Shanghai University and Middle School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to boycott the market to urge the government to send troops to Japan. The Executive Committee decided that this matter was of great importance, and the executive and supervisory committees could express their acceptance, but they must seek the consent of the various trade associations. The reporter of the New Voice Agency learned that the deadline for the inquiry letter was the 15th. He went to the secretariat of the association at 6 PM last night to inquire about the results. According to the reply, the association had received formal letters from the banking industry, money industry, bean and rice industry, miscellaneous grain oil cake industry, department store industry, knitting industry, miscellaneous grain oil cake exchange, rice grain industry, Chinese and Western woodenware industry, seafood and grocery industry, burst industry, silk satin industry, candle industry, Western-style woodenware industry, sauce and liquor industry, rental car industry, new drug industry, northern goods industry, longan industry, electrical industry, ice-fresh fish industry, Shaoxing wine industry, southern goods industry, fur industry, fresh pork industry, cake silk industry, shoe industry, Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd., silk edge industry, military uniform industry, sausage industry, sugar industry, embroidery industry, watch industry, Chinese candle industry, tea industry, bookbinding industry, color printing industry, copper and iron machinery industry, clothing industry, porcelain industry, straw hat industry, ivory ware industry, silverware industry, native cloth industry, cotton cloth industry, foil industry, jewelry industry, Chinese soap industry, paper industry, coal industry, fur and bone oil industry, Western paint industry, rice store industry, Fenjiu industry, glasses industry, bamboo industry, firewood and charcoal industry, motor silk weaving factory industry, paint woodenware industry, north and south goods dismantling industry, copper and tin industry, fresh meat industry, silk factory industry, shipping industry, etc., a total of 124 trade associations, public officials, and store members. They could not agree to a boycott. The association held its 23rd Executive Committee meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to follow the wishes of its members.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Various Road Business Federation Expresses Solemnity on Boycott <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Various Road Business Federation issued a notice to all stores in the city yesterday opposing the boycott, saying that since the fall of Jinzhou, the Japanese army has been approaching Shanhaiguan, and the shocking news has spread, causing public anger to boil, and no one is not the enemy with the same hatred. Our Shanghai students, motivated by righteousness, demanded that all stores in the city boycott the market to urge the government to send troops to resist Japan and recover the lost land. The patriotic enthusiasm is admirable. Since the Wanbaoshan incident, merchants have resolutely severed economic ties with Japan and voluntarily organized the National Salvation Volunteer Army, all to fulfill their duties of saving the country. Our country has suffered countless financial damages from years of internal strife. The central government's financial income comes from the people's blood and sweat. The general stores, although glorious and spectacular in the market, support their inside with the concept of unsuredness. The life of merchants has reached such a point and it is very difficult. Especially at this time of being approached by the violent sun and the government unable to cope with it, it is also the leaders of the Central Government, Wang, Hu, Jiang, etc., who have not yet come to Beijing to preside over the central government. Even if we want to boycott the market and demand troops, I am afraid that there is nothing to respond to. If the boycott can achieve the sending of troops to recover the lost land, then what happiness would our merchants not be willing to do? At a time when the government has not decided on a major plan for national salvation, any sacrifices by the people will not help. Moreover, it is now the period for the general collection and settlement of commercial taxes. The business operations of the stores rely on this end to fund the turnover and determine profit and loss. If the market is boycotted at this time, it will inevitably cause commercial terror and financial obstruction. The final result will be of no help to the facts and will make the commercial market a chaotic state. In short, how can the merchants' patriotism be behind others? In the past, the May 30th Massacre saw a boycott of up to 27 days. Their struggle with imperialism had a great fearless revolutionary spirit. They can make saving the country practical and avoid self-inflicted troubles and unnecessary sacrifices, dare not to agree. This association is for the personal pain of the member stores and has to solemnly express its opposition to the boycott.</p>
<p>The General Federation of Business Circles sent a letter to the various branch associations yesterday, stating: "Recently, some people have advocated boycotting the market as the backing for diplomacy. In fact, under this situation, domestic politics has not been put on track and diplomacy has no way to proceed. Among the leaders of the Kuomintang government who claim to save the country and the people, there are different strategies among the same party, scattered in all directions, and disregarding the national crisis. Even if the market is boycotted, the gentlemen will surely regard it as nothing and consider it a good thing, and the violent sun will not be able to damage it in the slightest. After all, this kind of action is a sacrifice. Sacrifice must have a price. This association believes that the act of boycotting the market is ultimately unavoidable when necessary, but it is absolutely impossible under the current state. This association's members, in the midst of saving the country and the people, must have the determination to use the boycott as a last resort, but they absolutely cannot abuse it. This letter is to inform your association to notify all members."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued an important announcement yesterday, stating: "For the announcement, yesterday's newspaper reported that representatives from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles convened a general meeting to discuss major plans for anti-Japanese national salvation. Due to the insufficient number of people at the time, the meeting was adjourned. A small number of people then illegally convened a meeting and advocated using the power of the public to take over the city's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. This association is organized by legitimate groups such as the city's agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles, and has been reported to the party and government agencies for record. It is by no means something that can be arbitrarily destroyed by a small number of the public. I am deeply afraid that all sectors will misunderstand, so I hereby announce it to the public."</p>

(B) How to handle the case of Zheng Kang, the owner of Dafeng Yarn, colluding with Japanese merchants and passing off Japanese yarn as domestic goods? It was resolved that (1) send a letter to the court to handle the matter strictly according to the law, (2) notify all sectors to sever ties with Dafeng, (3) send a letter to the yarn industry inspection team to report on fellow traders privately importing Japanese yarn as much as possible in order to warn unscrupulous merchants.</p>

The market was immediately shaken, and the public was alarmed. After reading your committee's declaration, we found it well-founded and logically sound.

If realized, it will plunge national credit and people's livelihood into an irrecoverable abyss. We sincerely hope that you will strive to maintain the original state of affairs no matter what. Our association will do its utmost to support you. If this is unfortunately not the case, tens of millions of bondholders may not forgive your association. Urgent words, please understand.

It is clear that your committee is organized by representatives of the people and that its stance is different from that of semi-official organizations. Your arguments based on law, national credit, and the people's livelihood are insightful. Considering that the regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and have the same effect as law, any order changing these regulations is invalid based on the fundamental principle that orders cannot change laws. If the head of the tax collection agency knows that he is a citizen and knows that there are national laws and appropriate regulations to execute, he should reject such orders.

However, seeing that the responsible officials of the government are wandering around and ignoring the national crisis, we fear that your loud appeals may not move them. However, we sincerely hope that our words are excessive and inaccurate. In the event that your telegram's 'otherwise' intentions are realized, we ask that you deeply understand that finance and politics are absolutely connected. Among the various measures, 'requesting the authorities to return power to the people so they can save themselves from the national crisis' is also one method.

<p>▲Speech at Fuchang Tobacco Company</p>
<p>▲Presented in a Private Capacity</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, sent his representative Han Liru to Shanghai to report the truth about Heilongjiang Province to all sectors. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., Mr. Han, in a private capacity, reported on General Ma's bloody battles and recent attitudes at the Fuchang Tobacco Company. His remarks are as follows:</p>
<p>"Brothers, I am here in a personal capacity to discuss General Ma's battle achievements, not as a representative. First, I must describe</p>
<h3 id="e178">Ma's History <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>He is a graduate of the military academy. He became famous in the Northeast for suppressing bandits. His methods of attacking bandits were slightly different from those of ordinary soldiers, in that he would seize the opportunity to attack before the bandits were ready. He was very agile and decisive, so his fame spread far and wide. I once traveled with the general and saw that the Russian border defense was tight and the soldiers were very energetic. Because of this, he decided to build up Heilongjiang. This was before the September 18th Incident. When Zhang Haipeng betrayed the country for the Japanese, General Ma telegraphed all sectors that, no matter what, he must</p>
<h3 id="e179">Fulfill His Duty to Defend the Territory <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>and never allow an inch of territory to be lost. Now Chairman Wan (Fulin) is not in Heilongjiang Province, and we must not retreat. Later, Beiping ordered General Ma to go to the provincial capital and act as chairman. At that time, Zhang Haipeng's troops also arrived at the provincial capital from Taonan. The garrison in the city knew that Zhang Haipeng had the support of the Japanese army and dared not confront them, so they retreated. General Ma then went to take over. On the 20th, he acted as chairman, on the one hand advising Zhang Haipeng not to be a lackey of the Japanese, and on the other hand using force to resist. Zhang retreated in a roundabout way, and the Japanese, using the excuse that the construction of the Nenjiang Bridge was funded by Japanese loans and that the bridge was damaged and needed to be repaired by the Japanese, but the general said that the damage to the bridge could be repaired by our side, so he refused. Until the 31st, the Japanese army suddenly notified General Ma that Commander Honjo ordered that the bridge must be repaired. That afternoon, the Japanese army went to Dajin Station and broke through our army's front. General Ma immediately notified the Japanese consul that the Liaoning Incident was the greatest unfortunate event, and if more unfortunate events occurred, the responsibility would be borne by the Japanese side. I (Han referring to himself) and the adjutant went to negotiate with the Japanese side, but as soon as we arrived at the front line,</p>
<h3 id="e180">War Began <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Because General Ma held a meeting on the evening of the previous day, saying that if the Japanese army came to attack and we did not resist, Heilongjiang Province would become part of Japan's territory. General Ma's soldiers also said that they would rather die under Chinese law than be trampled on by the Japanese army. At the beginning of the fire, the Japanese threw many bombs. The 31st was the first battle, and the first and second days were the period when the Japanese painstakingly used military fire. At that time, some advocated retreating to Hailun, but General Ma disagreed and was willing to fight to the death. He would retreat only after being defeated by the Japanese army. At one time, more than 10,000 people were mobilized, and the Japanese army had 6,000 to 8,000 participants. Our army then</p>
<h3 id="e181">Vigorously Attacked the Japanese寇 <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>were all very brave, but the Japanese army gained the upper hand everywhere because of the sharpness of its machine guns, and secretly sent cavalry to抄 our rear, resulting in a disadvantageous retreat to Sanjianfang. In this battle, 3,000 Japanese died and our army also suffered many casualties. From the 3rd to the 11th, there were small contacts every day. From this, it can be seen that although the Japanese are said to be strong, our military strategy is not weaker than theirs, and we are quite capable of dealing with them. The Japanese military weapons are sharper than ours, but the battle is only like this. At this point, the Chinese are no longer afraid of the Japanese army. The Battle of the Nenjiang Bridge really opened a new era in the psychological warfare between the Chinese and the Japanese. If this kind of psychology can be expanded, the Chinese will definitely be able to 制先 the Japanese. The Japanese even tried to alienate our country's feelings with the international community, and made counter-propaganda to the international community, claiming that our country's ability to win was actually due to collusion with the Russians. From November 4th to 16th, there were</p>
<h3 id="e182">Military Attaches Observing <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>the inside story of our army. As a result, the Japanese side's counter-propaganda failed, and this was the period to prove that the Chinese can fight. By the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and other days, the Japanese side transported more tanks and ammunition. On the evening of the 19th, General Ma returned from the front line to supervise the battle. At first, he thought that the Japanese could not cross the Middle East Road, but the Japanese actually crossed the road and came over the mountains and fields. At that time, the general trend was gone, and General Ma had no choice but to retreat. However, the reasons for the retreat are as follows: ㈠ The Chinese army had no new guns and no reinforcements. ㈡ There were no planes in the Chinese army, and it can be proved that the international community cannot be relied on and must be self-determined by the people. Only Ma</p>
<h3 id="e183">General's Recent Situation <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>is still good. The nearby vanguard is under his command, partly because of Ma's prestige and partly because of patriotism. Now there is a lack of food and bullets, but fortunately, a lot of remittances from all over the country have arrived in Heilongjiang. His army has adopted guerrilla warfare.</p>
<h3 id="e184">General's Will <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>will never change, and he must strive for the country's honor and sacrifice for the nation, and vow not to coexist with the Japanese. But Chairman Ma is not the Chairman Ma of the Northeast, but the Chairman Ma of the Central Government, the Chairman Ma of the whole country. He hopes that the whole country will give him assistance. Chairman Ma not only needs guns and bullets, but also talents. With three years of hard training, the international situation will be able to stop the Japanese at that time. Recently, there have been many reports that General Ma seems to have a tacit understanding with the Japanese, but this is actually Japanese counter-propaganda. When the Japanese army sent 板垣 to discuss with Ma, he was repeatedly rejected. Gentlemen, think about it, if Ma's achievements are like this, and our people welcome and praise General Ma, sing praises of his merits, and have a good reputation, how could General Ma in this position have the intention of changing his tune again? Please understand this intention from all walks of life. General Ma vowed to fight for the nation.</p>

<p>Yu Zhongbiao, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said: "Gentlemen, today is the opening day of the third National Goods Exhibition in Zhabei. The Municipal Party Headquarters sent me to represent them and participate. I feel very honored. Our country is now in a semi-colonial status. The economic aggression of imperialism and the inequality between countries may lead to the demise of our country. But in addition to the inequality between countries, which is due to the failure of diplomacy over the years, the economic aggression of imperialism can be said to be caused by ourselves. The United Kingdom destroyed India and the United States destroyed the Philippines. This is because the imperialists wanted to dump their goods, so they had to find a colony to serve as a base for dumping their goods. If we want to avoid the suffering of being slaves, the first thing we must do is to unite and resist foreign goods and promote national goods. In my humble opinion, the most important principles for promoting national goods can be divided into the following two points: ㈠ In a positive aspect, we should do our best to publicize and make all compatriots in the country happy to use national goods. ㈡ In a negative aspect, we must ensure that all people in the country will not refuse to use foreign goods, so that the economic aggression of imperialism will gradually decrease..." Chen Zeyi, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, then gave a speech, expressing many of his thoughts on promoting national goods. Subsequently, Sun Choucheng, the representative of the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, Zhu Jinchao, the representative of the National Goods Market of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Xu Jiannan from the Shanghai Machine-made Federation, and many others gave speeches (omitted due to length).</p>

<p>The venue of the third Zhabei National Goods Exhibition is located on the open space of the Zhabei Charity Group. The entire venue is divided into fifty-eight rooms, supported by wooden frames and covered with reed mats. Most of the shops in the entire venue have been completed, and thirty-two of them officially announced their opening for business yesterday. The remaining twenty-six will not be able to open on time due to unfinished renovations, but they will all be completed within three days and officially open for business.</p>

<p>Wei Zhong and He Zhongtang, representatives of the people of Runan County, Henan, came to Shanghai and planned to petition Wang Jingwei, but they fell ill and bedridden in Shanghai for more than twenty days and could not get out of bed. Now that they have recovered slightly, they are scheduled to meet within this week. The content of the petition is divided into four items:</p>

<p>According to Continental News, Ms. Wu Jinglian, daughter of former Beijing government Premier Wu Jinglian, has been in Europe for more than ten years and has a doctorate from the University of Paris. From August to September last year, she worked in the information department of the League of Nations and has recently returned to China (arriving in Shanghai just yesterday, the 14th). According to what she told our reporter, she once gathered compatriots in Paris to form an anti-Japanese association. An employee of the Paris Morning Post once told her that after the Pan陽 Incident, Japan spent huge sums of money to buy off influential newspapers in Europe, so news sent out by the Chinese side was not welcomed by European newspapers. The effectiveness of Chinese newspapers in disseminating news is weak, and the news sent by party headquarters in various places is often rejected by European newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Ms. Wu made a lengthy speech at a welcome meeting at the Guangdong Theater, saying that the League of Nations wanted to help China, but China failed to make good use of the opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Inside Story of Japanese Cotton Mills Canceling Monthly Bonuses <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲ Intending to Prolong Workers' Strike</p>
<p>▲ Enabling Factories to Save Expenses</p>
<p>The workers of Japanese-owned Kiwa Cotton Mill, Nichihua Cotton Mill, and Silk Mill in the Caojiadu area of western Shanghai are staging strikes in succession because the factories canceled their monthly bonuses. Although the Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and the Sixth District Police Department have sent personnel to mediate, and the Joint Association of Cotton Mill Workers has offered assistance, the attitude of the factory owners is firm, so there is still no hope of a resolution. It is learned that the Japanese-owned factories are implementing a uniform cancellation of the monthly bonus as a deliberate and exploitative plan. The Japanese factory owners have repeatedly held meetings and agreed to adhere to this policy. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese factories have suffered greatly from the boycott movement. Maintaining the status quo has been difficult. Seeing no hope of resolving the situation and facing endless losses, the Japanese factory owners discussed implementing a temporary shutdown. However, they realized that such a shutdown would create the following problems:</p>
<p>(1) If the factory announced a shutdown, all employees would have to be paid severance, pension, and bonuses.</p>
<p>(2) Most of the current workers have been employed for many years and are well-trained. If the factory were to shut down, they might be hired by Chinese-owned factories. If the factory were to reopen, it might be difficult to recruit workers.</p>
<p>(3) If the Japanese staff were to be laid off, they would have no income and face hardship. Therefore, the Japanese factory owners have hesitated to implement a shutdown. Unable to shut down but finding it difficult to continue operations, the Japanese factory owners have been anxious. As a last resort, after repeated discussions among all the Japanese factory owners, they decided that canceling the monthly bonus would be the only policy. By provoking the workers to revolt and stage strikes, the factory owners could refuse to compromise, thus prolonging the strike and allowing the factory to save expenses and achieve its intended purpose. Thus, the cancellation of monthly bonuses by the Japanese factories is a strategy to exploit workers and induce them to strike on their own, while the workers are being deceived.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Further Report on the Robbery of the Baofeng Steamer by Pirates <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>▲ Normal Departure Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Passengers Refused</p>
<p>The Baofeng steamer of the Jufeng Baoji Company in Nanshi, Shanghai, was robbed on its way from Shanghai to Chongming, and one passenger was killed. This incident was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The details of the incident are reported as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e198">Robbery Situation <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The pirates boarded the ship disguised as passengers in Shanghai. There were more than thirty of them, mixed in with the steerage passengers. The steamer departed at 8:00 PM on the 13th. At 9:30 PM, it reached Wusong, and at 9:45 PM, it arrived at the Sanxia Waterway. The pirates emerged from the cabin and fired pistols as a warning. Four bandits rushed to the bow and took the ship owner under surveillance. They ordered the first mate, Yuan Shengpin, to change course. When the first mate refused, he was beaten by the bandits. The bandits then took control of the ship themselves. Another group of bandits rushed to the engine room. The chief engineer was on leave, so the second engineer took his place. The bandits called out, "Please help us." All the positions on the ship were taken over by the pirates, and the crew members were locked in the cabins.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Looting of All Cabins <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Four of the pirates carried pistols, while the others used knives and other weapons. After taking control of the ship, they entered the purser's office and forced Deng Chunmao to hand over money. When Deng hesitated, he was beaten by the bandits. Deng did not resist and allowed them to search the office. They looted more than 2,800 yuan in cash and more than 700 yuan of the purser's personal funds. They also took his leather coat, gold ring, and other belongings. After looting the purser's office, they entered the main cabin and searched the passengers. There were more than 500 passengers on the ship. They were searched one by one, and even those who had one yuan were robbed. Clothes and jewelry were taken as well. The passengers were robbed of more than 1,700 yuan in cash. After the robbery, the passengers were locked in the main cabin. The pirates then went to the upper deck and searched the crew members. It can be said that the pirates looted the Baofeng steamer so thoroughly that no one was left with a single penny.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Passenger Killed <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>While the pirates were looting, gunshots rang out like a string of beads. The passengers screamed for help. The Xinsheng steamer of the Xinglong Company passed by and heard the gunshots and screams from the Baofeng steamer. They knew that it was being robbed and that the Baofeng was heading towards Daxieshan. When the Xinsheng arrived at Qinglong Port, it sent a telegram to the Jufeng Company in Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 14th. That night, when the ship was being looted, a passenger shouted for help and was shot dead by the pirates. The body was abandoned in the main cabin.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Five People Injured <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Two passengers, Shi Jinzhang and others, were shot for resisting the pirates. The crew members who were injured by the pirates were First Mate Yuan Shengpin, Third Engineer Lin A'kai, and Tea Boy Cao Linjiang. They were all wounded by the pirates with knives. After the steamer returned to Shanghai yesterday, they were sent to Nanyang Hospital and Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Loss of Goods <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>After taking the cash, the bandits opened the cargo hold and took away one bolt of cloth, twelve dan of soybean oil, and other miscellaneous goods, as well as clothing from passengers and crew members. At 5:30 AM on the 14th (after nine hours of looting), when the ship arrived in the waters off Daxieshan, the bandits first sounded the whistle twice, then fired a shot into the air, and then used a flashlight to signal the sea. Two large sailboats arrived, and the bandits took the stolen goods from the passenger cabins onto the sailboats and escaped to their hideout.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Boiler Dismantled <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Before leaving, the bandits declared that because the crew members did not resist, they would not damage the ship. However, fearing that they would be pursued, they dismantled the three boilers in the ship's engine room so that it could not move. After they left, the ship owner reassembled the three boilers and then lit the fires and sailed to Shanghai, so the delay was considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Examination of the Corpse <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the Jufeng Company reported the incident to the Haihai Association, which in turn reported it to the court. At 4:30 PM yesterday, the court sent personnel to the ship to examine the body of the passenger who had been shot dead by the bandits. After the examination, the body was handed over to the association for safekeeping. Since there were no relatives, the body will be kept until claimed.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Hosting Distressed Passengers <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>After the passengers returned to Shanghai, all of their money had been robbed, and their luggage and clothing were gone. The Jufeng Company provided them with food and accommodation, and bought tickets for them on the Baohua and other steamers to send them back to their hometowns in Chongming and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Fumigation and Disinfection of the Ship <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Since there had been a passenger killed on the ship, according to customs regulations, the ship must be fumigated and disinfected before it can sail again. Yesterday afternoon, the ship was fumigated by the Jianghai Customs, and the fumigation was completed at 10:00 PM. Therefore, the steamer will not carry third-class passengers on its trip to Chongming, but cargo will be loaded as usual. The steamer is scheduled to depart for Chongming at 1:00 AM this morning. The robbery of the Baofeng steamer resulted in the death of one passenger, injuries to five crew members and passengers, and the loss of more than 5,000 yuan in cash, as well as a large amount of clothing and jewelry.</p>
<h3 id="e207">League of Nations Engineering Inspection Group Visits the City Center <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Engineering Inspection Group, a group of five people led by Mr. Haas, Minister of Transportation of the League of Nations, arrived in China at the beginning of the month. The members of the group include Mr. Berriais, Mr. Godd, Dr. Civic, and Mr. Budley. Mr. Berriais is the chief engineer of the Paris City Road and Bridge Management Office and the secretary of the Road and Bridge Committee. He has served as the chief engineer in Annam, Tokyo, and other places. The flood control plan for Tokyo was planned by Mr. Berriais, who is a world-renowned flood control expert. Mr. Godd is the founder of the famous British engineering company "Goddway Engineering Company" and is currently a member of the British Engineering Society. He has extensive experience in harbors and all river engineering. Mr. Civic is currently the director of the Hamburg Harbor Management Office in Germany and is also a water conservancy expert. Mr. Budley has been involved in flood control projects in Java, Sumatra, and other places for many years. The above individuals are all well-known figures in the engineering field. The purpose of their visit to China is to inspect the engineering situation in China and study engineering improvement issues. The city center area plan is one of China's great new construction projects. At 9:00 AM on the 14th, the group was accompanied by Mr. Shen, Director of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, to visit Wusong and the city center area. In the afternoon, they went to Pudong to conduct an on-site inspection. It is rumored that the issue of improving the Shanghai port will be discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Wenmiao Park Library to Open Soon <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Wenmiao Park, which was built after the completion of the reconstruction of Wenmiao Road in Ximen, was informally opened to the public on the 1st and 2nd of this month. Nearly 10,000 people visited the park during the two days. However, due to minor construction projects in the park and the construction of the former Minglun Primary School on the site, which is being prepared for an exhibition room of the Public Education Center, the park gates are still closed as usual. There is a library in the park, which is an oriental-style building that showcases brilliance to the fullest extent. However, the library is deep and the light is not very adequate. The director of the library has recently been appointed by the Municipal Education Bureau as Zhuang Yun. Zhuang once held an important position at the Palace Museum in Beiping. The layout of the library is mostly complete. The books purchased are currently being processed. In addition, major bookstores in Shanghai have donated approximately 3,000 volumes of books to the library. The office of the Municipal Public Education Center is located in the Chong Sheng Temple. Since the new year, the center has been operating in accordance with the organizational regulations set by the Municipal Education Bureau, dividing into general affairs, editing, and lecturing sections. The director of the center, Li Dachao, took office yesterday. It is rumored that the opening of Wenmiao Park and the library is scheduled for the 25th of this month. The park will be open to the public for sightseeing. From then on, Shanghai will have a new recreational garden for public education. Because the park is located in a convenient transportation area in the city center, it is expected that there will be many visitors during the spring and autumn.</p>

<p>▲ Bargemen's Guild Resolves Severe Punishment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal and Stone Bargemen's Guild held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, with Ruan Xuetao as chairman. The chairman began by reporting on a letter from the Coal Industry Association. The letter stated that Yongchang had privately purchased Japanese coal, and that the bargeman was Wu Jingen, a member of the guild. At a time when Japan is rampant and the country is in a state of indignation, such an unfortunate incident has occurred, which is regrettable. Moreover, Wu Jingen is a Japanese goods inspector of the guild, stationed at the Xin Sanjing Coal Stack. Knowing the situation, he knowingly violated the rules. It was proposed how should he be punished and a unanimous resolution was made:</p>
<p>(1) His membership will be revoked and he will not be allowed to enter the market.</p>
<p>(2) A letter will be sent to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to actively handle the matter.</p>
<p>(3) A letter will be sent to the Coal Industry Association and the Sand and Gravel Industry Association, informing all coal and sand and gravel businesses that they should refuse to let him transport goods in the future.</p>
<p>(4) If any member of the guild colludes with Wu Jingen to act as a substitute, they will be dealt with in accordance with the previous resolution.</p>

<p>▲ Quarrel Arising from Debt Collection</p>
<p>▲ Also Involving a Woman</p>
<p>Guo Hanqing, the nephew of the late merchant Guo Biao, has many friends. He has been running a long-term room at 301 Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road for a year. At about 12:30 AM yesterday morning, his friend Qiu Mengrong visited Guo at Cangzhou. The two suddenly quarreled. Qiu took out a small knife and stabbed Guo Hanqing in the chest, causing serious injuries. The Jing'an Temple Police Department sent detectives to arrest Qiu and sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Guo and Qiu have known each other for a long time and have a close relationship. They not only enjoy each other's company but also share their wealth. Before the incident yesterday morning, Qiu came in from the outside and first talked to Guo on the phone. Guo then went downstairs to the lobby in front of the accounting room. After the two met, Qiu seemed to be collecting a debt from Guo. However, harsh words were exchanged, and Guo was stabbed by Qiu with a small knife. It is also said that Guo owed Qiu about 600 yuan. In addition, a woman was involved, inevitably causing jealousy and leading to this misfortune. Qiu Mengrong, who was arrested by the police, is the son of a landlord in the Xinminjie area of Jing'an Temple Road, but he has long held Portuguese citizenship. Guo Hanqing is currently being treated at Baolong Hospital. The knife wound is below the ribs and breast. If the injury worsens, it is a serious matter.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Huang Baiying and Tong Sanmao to Meet Again in Court <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tong Sanmao Appeals to the Third Instance</p>
<p>▲ Supreme Court Sends Case Back for Retrial</p>
<p>In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic, Huang Baiying, a dancer, formed an unbreakable bond with Tong Sanmao, the young owner of Renkang Hardware Store at 316 East Broadway, at the Datong Dance Hall. From then on, they danced together every night, showing great affection. At dawn on June 29th of that year, Tong took her from the Paris Dance Hall in a car to the seaside in Wusong, intending to commit suicide by drowning. However, they changed their minds. On the way back to Shanghai, Tong got out of the car, bought poison, and went to the Cangzhou Hotel, intending to commit suicide together. When Huang Baiying swallowed the poison first, Tong suddenly did not want to die. The police were informed and immediately sent detectives to take Huang Baiying to the hospital. Fortunately, she was rescued quickly. Tong was charged with abetting suicide and prosecuted in the Provisional Court. After the trial, the evidence was conclusive, and he was sentenced to two years in prison. Tong did not accept the verdict and appealed, but the result was still the same. Since then, Tong has been imprisoned in the West Prison of Tilanqiao. Huang Baiying's fame has spread far and wide, and dance halls and singers are vying to hire her. She has now abandoned her dancing career and become a famous actress. Tong Sanmao has been in prison for nearly a year and a half, and no one has visited him. However, he still does not accept the crime he was convicted of. Therefore, after losing the second instance, he immediately appealed to the third instance.

<p>▲ Three People Injured, One Dead</p>
<p>Chen Deqian, a garbage cart driver from Yancheng who worked for the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, was driving a No. 5 horse-drawn cart on the afternoon of the 13th of this month at 1:20 PM, passing near Beisichuan Road and  Road. The traffic light was red at that location, so he could not proceed and stopped the cart to wait. A certain car suddenly sounded its horn, and the sound was very loud. The horse was startled and jumped violently, breaking the leather straps and running north on Hainan Road towards Tiantong Road. The driver Chen was unable to restrain the horse, which knocked down Du Qinfu, a cyclist from Songjiang, Jin Qingrong, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, and Wang Youcai, a twenty-one-year-old rickshaw puller (from Jiangbei), all of whom were injured. West Indian detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, including Hua Detective An Sibeng, arrived at the scene after hearing the news. The three injured persons were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. A Western ticket seller on a public bus saw the incident and bravely stepped forward to stop the horse, realizing that it was a No. 5 garbage cart from the Public Works Department that had caused the accident. After a while, the driver Chen Deqian arrived and turned himself in to the police. One of the injured, Wang Youcai, was fatally injured and died in the hospital in the evening. The body was sent to the Philo Road autopsy station. The First Special District Court sent a prosecutor to the station to confirm the death and make arrangements for the coffin. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chen Deqian to the First Court. The police attorney, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case and stated that the family members of the deceased, Wang Youcai, were all in their hometown. Today, the injured Du and Jin were present in court. He also presented the broken leather strap for inspection. The Chinese and Western detectives and the ticket seller also testified about the situation at the time. Du Qinfu testified that he was a messenger for a company at No. 2 Hong Kong Road and was fortunate to have suffered only minor injuries and had already recovered. The rickshaw puller Jin Qingrong suffered a severe injury to his right leg and had to be carried in and seated on the ground. He was unable to stand and briefly described the circumstances of the injury. The court ordered a medical examination to assess the injuries. The driver Chen Deqian confessed that the horse jumped violently when it heard the car horn, breaking the leather straps, and he was unable to restrain it, causing the accident. He asked the court to consider this. Judge Shen Bingrong, after , ordered that he be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Infant's Head Severed in Gruesome Incident <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>▲ Cruel Actions Related to Flower Gambling</p>
<p>A two-foot-long red-painted thin-board coffin was abandoned on the side of Maishiai Road in the French Concession  Shilou Road the night before. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, the coffin was discovered, and the lid was pried open, revealing the body of an infant inside. The infant's head had been severed, causing great alarm. Passersby reported the incident to the French Concession Police Station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. It was determined that the body in the coffin was that of a female infant, five or six months old. No family members were found. The body and the coffin were taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Station. According to the detective's investigation, a rickshaw puller in the area said that he had seen the coffin abandoned on the side of the road the night before. The coffin lid was intact. This morning, he saw that the coffin was covered with a straw mat, and the coffin lid had been pried open. The detective reported the information to the police chief, who ordered that the court be notified today to send personnel to conduct an autopsy and determine the cause of death. It is speculated that the infant's head was severed by flower gambling gamblers to pray for dreams in order to win the flower gambling. Otherwise, why would a five- or six-month-old infant have any grievances with anyone, and why would they be subjected to such cruelty after death?</p>

However, the plaintiff's attorney, Lu Xingyuan, opposed the postponement. After a lengthy debate with the defendant's attorney, Jiang Yiping, the judge Xu ruled in court that the rescheduling would be permitted.</p>

<p>There are often troublemakers on the Yangtze River steamers traveling between Shanghai and Hankou. On this occasion, on the 14th of this month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun Steamer returned to Shanghai from Hankou. When the ship reached the Jiujiang area, more than a dozen ruffians led by Tian Zhiquan forcibly boarded the ship, making a living by gambling and swindling money. After boarding the ship, they forcibly took food, and crew members and sailors were often beaten. When the Jiangshun Steamer arrived at Liuhe, the ruffian Tian Zhiquan impersonated a ticketing officer and extorted fares from passenger Wang Rufang. Wang Rufang refused to pay because he was not a ticketing officer. Tian Zhiquan became angry and, together with his accomplices, beat Wang Rufang, causing him to bleed profusely and nearly killing him. Seeing that they had caused a life-threatening injury, Tian and his group threw Wang Rufang into the river, intending to cover up the crime. Fortunately, passenger Wei Zhengtang saw the incident and reported it to the ticketing officer, who notified the escorting military police. The military police apprehended the assailant Tian Zhiquan and the witness Wei Zhengtang. Yesterday, when the Jiangshun Steamer arrived in Shanghai, the assailant and the witness Wei Zhengtang were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Suicide Note Urges Awareness from Authorities</p>
<p>Zhuang Bosheng, a local oiler at the Japanese-owned Tongxing Cotton Mill, lived in the countryside on Binlang Road. He participated in the workers' petition the other day after being forced to retire by the Japanese. On his way home, he passed by Robert Sheng Road and could not help but glare at a small squad of Japanese soldiers nearby. The Japanese soldiers grabbed him and beat him without asking any questions. By the time the patrolling police arrived, the Japanese soldiers had already fled. In anger, Zhuang went home and told people that the people of weak countries were not even worth as much as dogs and horses. He then closed the door and went to bed. He wrote a suicide note, which said that a great man in this world could not have great vision. Rather than living a humble life, it would be better to die to awaken the authorities. He did not care whether it was right or wrong. After writing the note, he drank all the sedative he had bought for insomnia in the past. When his family saw that Zhuang had not woken up yesterday morning, his wife suspected that he was ill and asked him. She found that he had no breath and felt icy cold. She began to cry loudly. His family found an empty bottle and a suicide note next to his pillow. His brother reported the incident to the workers at the factory, who will keep the note as a memento.</p>

<p>Since the summer of last year, continuous rain has damaged the autumn harvest. The County Funds Department reported the situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting an investigation and reduction of taxes. The Provincial Government replied that the surcharge on grain this year was approved by the Executive Yuan and used to subsidize the anti-bandit military expenses, and all counties were ordered to comply. As for the disaster relief measures this year, the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Agriculture Departments were ordered to dispatch personnel to the counties to investigate the disaster situation. After the departments report, the matter will be reviewed. You are hereby notified.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Problem of Transporting Huge Quantities of US Relief Wheat <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>▲ Telegram from Yu Hede to Song Ziwen</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of foreign merchants transporting relief wheat, Director Yu of the Relief Flood Disaster Association's Transportation Group has sent two telegrams to Chairman Song, but has not yet received a reply. The text of the telegrams is as follows: (1) "To Minister Song in Nanjing, re: Relief wheat for the flood disaster, bids were invited for transportation. At yesterday's meeting, foreign merchants bid a rate of 3.25 silver cents per bag for wooden barges and 5.25 silver cents for iron barges, plus a handling fee of 1 silver cent per bag. Chinese merchants bid 3.7 silver cents for wooden barges, equivalent to 2.68 yuan, which is 0.57 silver cents cheaper per bag than the foreign merchants, and there is no handling fee. I suggest contracting with Chinese merchants to save expenses. Please approve and instruct. Yu Hede." (2) "To Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, re: Transporting relief wheat for the Flood Relief Association, a telegram was previously sent. It was expected that you would investigate and handle the matter. Currently, the relief wheat is still being transported by the foreign merchant Brownell &amp; Co. They are using large iron barges, the holds of which are hard and the bottom is deep. When loading, the bags are dropped from a height. When loading onto ships, they are hooked up, resulting in many broken bags. Furthermore, each barge carries at least 200 tons, causing delays and losses during loading and unloading. These problems can be avoided by using wooden barges. It is also heard that a significant amount of wheat has leaked from the bottom of the foreign merchant's iron barges, which they refuse to sweep up and load onto the ships. The loss in weight will be considerable. As the person in charge of transportation, I am deeply aware of the advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, as this matter concerns disaster relief and is the focus of public attention, I must report it in advance to clarify my responsibility. I beg you to consider and approve my previous telegram to switch to Chinese merchants using wooden barges to facilitate transportation and reduce losses. Your instructions will be greatly appreciated. Yu Hede."</p>

The inauguration and closing ceremonies were held in the afternoon, with a solemn ceremony. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e223">Fourth Meeting <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>

<h3 id="e225">Closing Address <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Closing speech by Yu Qixiang, Chairman of the Congress: "Distinguished guests, fellow representatives, I, as the chairman of this congress, would like to deliver this address. As we speak different dialects, I would like to ask Comrade Lao Jieming to translate. This representative congress has been in preparation for several years before finally being able to convene in Shanghai today. Representatives from sixteen regions have attended, and the discussion of proposals over the past few days has been very smooth. Therefore, I believe that the future is very promising. As to why this congress took so many years to achieve, the reason is that culture has not yet been popularized and politics has not yet been put on the right track. Since we know that we cannot compare with Europe and America in terms of culture and technology, we should work harder to catch up. The postal service has a great relationship with various aspects of society. We, who serve the postal service, have a particularly close relationship with all sectors of society because scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants all need the postal service to provide indirect assistance. Therefore, we who serve should cherish the postal service. This is fulfilling our duty to all sectors of society. Therefore, the postal service is the crystallization of our employees' efforts. Since this crystallization has such a great relationship with society, we should do our best to support and develop it. If it were in a politically enlightened country, the postal service would not need its employees to exert themselves to seek development, but China is not such a country. Therefore, we should pay extra attention to ensuring that it gets fully developed. However, we postal employees should always do our best, and not shrink back because we feel that the current environment is bad. This time, there have been many good proposals, which have been jointly discussed by representatives from various regions for several days. Now they have all been handed over to the executive committee to implement, so that they can be realized in due course. At the same time, I hope that we postal workers will act according to principles, so that the resolutions can be successfully completed as soon as possible."</p>

<p>After the groundbreaking ceremony for the third dry dock, the keel-laying ceremony for the two new naval gunboats was held at the shipyard.

After completion, they will be dispatched to the coastal areas to suppress bandits, as the Navy believes that the existing warships are insufficient to patrol the coast and rivers where bandits appear frequently.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday stating that it had received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's Business Tax Collection Office, which stated that it had received an order from the Finance Bureau to extend the deadline for filing business tax returns for various industries in the city for January 21 to January 22, in accordance with Article 11 of the Collection Regulations, to facilitate the process.

This is to be followed accordingly. This letter is to be forwarded to the various industries for their information and compliance.</p>

The charcoal fire in the brazier was too intense and ignited the straw. The child cried out in pain, but there was no one to help him. Soon, he was burned to death. When Jiang Shiming returned home in the afternoon, he smelled smoke. He entered the room and saw that his son's body was charred and lifeless in the straw stack. It was a tragic sight.</p>

With a road that is less than forty feet wide, such a large number of parked cars not only hinders traffic but also greatly affects commerce. They have sent a letter requesting the 35th District Branch of the Citizens' Union to find a way to prohibit parking. The association, because the merchants' request was in the public interest, held a meeting and decided to ask the General Association to handle the matter to achieve the goal of prohibition.</p>

<p>The Zhongshan Native Place Association on Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, was borrowed by the Fourth District Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang in the spring of 1927 as an office. The association's public welfare, charity, education, and various other undertakings were suspended as a result, and the tables, chairs, furniture, and other equipment were not completely preserved. Therefore, the association's election meetings and family gatherings have been held at the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Association on Bazilu in recent years. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Fang Weiren, Zhou Ding, Zhou Shuzhuang, and others from the Fourth District Party Department, along with Police Chief Wang Fuchen and police officers Ding Shangtong and Gui Bin from the Second Branch of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, went to the association's premises and completely removed all documents and equipment from the District Party Department's Executive Committee. They also stated that the rooms borrowed from the association would be returned to the association for its management. All procedures were properly accepted by Li Yiqin and Tang Hui, publicity officers of the association's organizing committee.</p>

<p>Li Juqing from Shaoxing is engaged in modern beekeeping and has rich experience. He has selected excellent bee breeds and established the Li Juqing Bee Farm in Baihuangqiao, Shaoxing City. It has been successful for more than ten years. New bees have been sold to various ports in Tianjin and have been well received. The farm's new bees for this spring, as well as the original colonies to be delivered in early spring, are now available for pre-order. A distribution brochure is available upon request. Beekeeping was invented in our country a long time ago. According to the records of thousands of years ago, it has been recorded, but it is a pity that we have been sticking to the old methods and not improving it, and we have fallen behind today. I hope that the people of our country will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>▲ A Large Shipment Has Now Arrived</p>
<p>The Lion Brand beef juice and chicken juice, made with cold-pressed salt by the German Malta Pharmaceutical Factory, managed by this port’s Huada Pharmacy, has seen a surge in sales in the past year. Many important figures in the Chinese government have also purchased and consumed the products. Recently, they have also been adopted by members of society as gifts, leading to increased demand. Because the pharmacy’s manager, Mr. Cao Mengyu, has managed the distribution appropriately, supply has been able to meet demand, rarely resulting in stockouts. However, shipments from Germany to China have mostly traveled through Northwest Siberia. After the Shenyang Incident, transportation was disrupted, leading to a stockout for more than ten days. During this time when gift-giving is prevalent, the pharmacy was unable to meet market demand and was extremely apologetic. A large shipment of beef juice and chicken juice has now arrived, so those who wish to purchase the products will not have to make a wasted trip.</p>

<p>Zhang Changsheng, a child from Zhangjiayuan, Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, was previously learning martial arts with his uncle, Zhang Wanshun, and was transferred to Shanghai. He suffered repeated abuse and fled in private. He was rescued by the Protection Department of the Children's Welfare Association. The Lujiawan French Concession Police Station was notified and interrogated Zhang Wanshun, giving him appropriate punishment. It was also ruled that Zhang Changsheng be placed in the Children's Welfare Association's affiliated Children's Education and Care Center and that Zhang Wanshun not be allowed to claim him. Later, it was learned that the child still had a biological mother, Zhang Liu, at home. A letter was sent to her asking her to come to Shanghai to claim him, and a letter was sent to Li Xuemo, the magistrate of Wuqiao County Government, asking him to summon Zhanghua locally to obtain a concrete guarantee before coming to claim him. Zhang Liu arrived in Shanghai the other day, going straight to the Children's Education and Care Center to meet Zhang Changsheng. After speaking, they embraced and cried bitterly. She was grateful that the Children's Welfare Association was able to speak out for justice and seek happiness for abused children. With his great-uncle Zhang Liechen as a witness and Tongxingheji as a guarantor, a guarantee was given to the Children's Welfare Association. The association has handed over Zhang Changsheng to his biological mother, and the family has been reunited.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I read in the local news section of your newspaper on the 14th of this month that the Pubin Bank in Minhang Town, the first district of your county, was robbed of 4,000 yuan. However, there is no Pubin Bank in Minhang Town. The only financial institution is our Puhai Bank, and there has been no robbery. We believe it was a mistake that on the evening of the 8th of this month, our bank was broken into by thieves, who stole a total of over 900 yuan of silver and miscellaneous coins that had not yet been deposited in the treasury. We are afraid that the rumors will be untrue, so we ask you to correct the letter as appropriate. Yours sincerely, Puhai Bank of Minhang, January 14th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read in your newspaper's local news column an article entitled "Japanese Exclude Chinese Seamen" with the news "Zheng Ji Employs Japanese People." It says that our company is now dismissing Chinese sailors one after another, successively hiring Japanese people to replace them, and that Wang Gongrang, the chief engineer of the Fuli wheel, has been suspended, and Japanese people have been forcibly sent to the ship, causing opposition from the crew. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Our company has not only not dismissed Chinese sailors and hired Japanese people, but has also dismissed dozens of Japanese sailors since this year. The facts are clear and can be easily verified. However, Wang Gongrang's departure from the Fuli wheel was actually a crew transfer. The crew member refused to be transferred and resigned on his own. It was not the company's intention to suspend him. I am afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so I am writing to you to present the facts, hoping that you will correct them to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Zheng Ji Steamship Company, January 15th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I read in today's newspaper that the Reuter's dispatch from Berlin on January 14 stated that the Friedrich Alfred factory, which closed today, is not located in Essen, but in Rheinhausen, not far from Duisburg. It is an old steel factory owned by Krupp. Recently, the company has built a new steel factory near Essen in Bochum to replace the old factory in Rheinhausen, so the old factory has been closed. Our bank is the manager of Krupp, and we are providing the facts. Sincerely, Lihe Foreign Bank.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I read in today's newspaper that I took the night train to Beijing last night. However, I am still in Shanghai and have not gone anywhere else. Moreover, because the government is thick-skinned and humiliating the country, and losing its sovereignty, I have not participated in party politics. I am afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so I am writing to you to clarify. Sincerely, He Xiangning, January 15th, noon.</p>

<p>Bitter. Study. Save. The Nation. Miss. Yuan. Tou. Zhen.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese imperialists have inflicted their aggression and brutality upon our three northeastern provinces, the youth of our entire nation, stirred by righteous indignation and the surge of ardent blood, have spontaneously organized volunteer armies and rescue teams, sometimes departing to the front lines to serve. Others have formed groups for lecturing, posting slogans, distributing leaflets, and even petitioning in the capital as a whole. Finally, before the end of the semester, they have voluntarily suspended classes to engage in practical work. This practical work is still in its initial stages. Students from other provinces have already returned home for the New Year, and those in the local area have stopped attending school. Scattered in this way, how will the work actually progress? How should the work be done in the future? I think it will inevitably involve continuing efforts with strikes and petitions. However, I believe that, for practical work, strikes are absolutely unfeasible, and mass petitions are also unnecessary. Although the power of a mass petition is great, it is also fraught with danger. It would be such a pity to sacrifice valuable young people in vain. Our future nation depends on the righteousness of the youth. How should young students cherish themselves?</p>
<p>During this time of national crisis, the path our young students should take is to focus on their studies, advance step by step, recognize what China lacks and needs, accelerate their pursuit of knowledge, and conduct extensive research. I believe that the Chinese are not inherently untalented; they simply do not put in enough effort. For example, some of our young students study military affairs, some study politics, some study medicine, some study engineering, some study commerce, and some study education and mathematics. It can be said that there are students of all kinds. How many of them actually succeed in their studies? Most rely on political changes to create opportunities for employment, and many drop out of school halfway. How regrettable this is! We should now break this opportunism and strive for in-depth scholarship. At this critical moment of national crisis, we should work hard to study. Studying is not about being calm or not resisting; it is precisely the preparation for resistance. During this period, those studying military affairs should intensify their training and delve into tactics. Those studying politics should pay attention to diplomacy and observe the international situation, which is particularly important. Those studying medicine should practice. Those studying engineering should research manufacturing, aiming to make inventions in weaponry and machinery that surpass other countries. Those studying commerce should study international trade. Those studying education should research how to lead young people. Those studying mathematics and chemistry should bury themselves in deep thought and go to the laboratories. Our lack of scientific knowledge is well known and should be particularly emphasized. Those studying agriculture should study farming. Those studying art should widely promote literature and posters to make everyone understand the Japanese aggression and brutality. They should also compose songs to inspire people. We know that China does not lack soldiers; we do not need everyone to become a soldier. We only need everyone to fulfill their respective roles and responsibilities. In the inevitable time of war, our soldiers will fight on the front lines, and the accumulation of food in the rear will depend on the development of agriculture. The supply of military equipment will depend on the rapid and excellent manufacturing. The treatment of the wounded will rely on the skillful surgeries of doctors. The transmission of military information will rely on the completeness of transportation. Furthermore, transportation and newspapers, etc., all require the design of our specialized scholars, which is the responsibility of our young students. How can we easily abandon what we have learned? Only through diligent study can we save the nation. Striving to study is our effective work. (Ding)</p>

<h3 id="e256">We Should Support the Righteous and Brave Army <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>丨丨 Because this is the people's own military force. China has raised more than two million soldiers. Including all local militias, police, and irregular troops, the total number must be over three million. According to the Ministry of Finance, the military expenditure required for regular troops each year already accounts for 80% of the total financial expenditure. Combining this with other local defense expenses and various levies, the enormous figure is even more shocking. However, such a huge military expenditure is only used to support warlords as pawns, seize power, and extract the blood and flesh of the people, causing endless internal strife for the past twenty years. We can say that our country has no national military force, no people's military force, but only a military force that serves individuals and brings disaster to the country and people.</p>
<p>When the disaster in the Northeast broke out, Zhang Xueliang strictly ordered the Northeast Army not to resist. Within a few days, half of the Northeast was lost. When the Japanese army attacked Longjiang, General Ma Zhanshan fought alone. Zhang Xueliang again remained inactive, sending not a single soldier to help. As a result, Longjiang fell. When the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou, Zhang Xueliang ordered the troops stationed in Jinzhou to retreat entirely into the customs without fighting back. Instead, he used the excuse that the central government did not provide ammunition or sufficient pay, and sent a telegram saying, "I do not want to be a political sacrifice." Such foolish, weak, and power-hungry soldiers, such negligent and unpatriotic officials, deserve to die ten thousand times over.</p>
<p>As for the troops in the provinces within the customs, they are also merely tools of individuals, only knowing how to point their guns inward. When foreign enemies are approaching and the country is being torn apart, they turn a deaf ear. The people are squeezed for their blood and sweat to support the army, but the army only brings disaster to the country and people. This phenomenon is truly heartbreaking and a clear lesson for us.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the three northeastern provinces, righteous and brave armies have sprung up everywhere, attacking the Japanese army everywhere, making the enemy exhausted. In the Battle of Jinzhou, the stationed troops retreated entirely, but the righteous and brave army fought desperately, firmly defending the city. Eventually, they were outnumbered and Jinzhou inevitably fell. Recently, in the area around Dahu Mountain, they have repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. According to yesterday's news, they have even recaptured Dahu Mountain. The momentum of the righteous and brave army is extremely strong. These facts and actions are truly worthy of praise and tears, and represent the hope of our entire nation!</p>
<p>The righteous and brave army is the people's own military force. Only the people's own military force can resist tyranny and defend against foreign aggression, and only then can we save ourselves and the country. Only when the people organize themselves, arm themselves, and take on the responsibility of saving the country can the country be saved. Hoping for others is like quenching thirst with plums; it is ultimately futile.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should now earnestly support the righteous and brave armies fighting hard in various parts of the Northeast, giving them spiritual encouragement and material assistance. At the same time, the people in various regions should especially organize themselves and prepare to use their own military force to defeat the military force of the imperialists and all evil forces. Only in this way can China have a way out, and only then can the suffering people of China have a way out.</p>

<h3 id="e257">A Rare Death A Humble Opinion <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>"Death" is not rare, because "all men must die." However, I consider the death of my friend He Mo to be "rare." This is of course not because he was my friend, but because he was also a "person," and a pure young person.</p>
<p>In these troubled times, "speaking" and "writing articles" must be done carefully. This is true. However, He Mo never said "unpleasant words," nor did he write "articles that should not be written." He sat in his room reading all day long. Who knew that "disaster descends from the sky even when one sits in a room"? He Mo was suddenly arrested and imprisoned. The crime for which he was imprisoned was said to be the discovery of several books on the study of scientific socialism on his desk.</p>
<p>"Truth" has long resided under the eaves of those in authority. He Mo actually fantasized about finding truth in books. That is of course an unforgivable crime, and "violates" the "law." Therefore, he easily obtained a rose-colored crown.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, He Mo was also a poor boy. He had nothing good to stuff the dog hole. The dog hole was not stuffed, so the dog would naturally come out and bite people. Therefore, He Mo suffered multiple tortures after being imprisoned.</p>
<p>This pure young man had only a candid heart. I know that he had neither made a revolution nor opposed a revolution, or reformed a revolution.</p>
<p>The death of a revolutionary is "achieving benevolence," and the death of a counter-revolutionary is "being executed." Logically, since He Mo was not qualified to "achieve benevolence," he would naturally not be "executed." Therefore, he was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment between being unclear about whether he was guilty or innocent.</p>
<p>In the iron window like a beast cage, He Mo was almost sick for a year. Before his imprisonment period was over, his illness became heavier day by day. There was no doctor to diagnose him and no medicine to take. A person who has "violated" the "law" "should" die, let alone just be sick?</p>
<p>The prisoners in the same prison as He Mo, watching his illness become serious, felt a little sad. They asked the prison guard to remove the iron shackles from his feet, because he had long been unable to move. After a few more days, the prison officer discovered that this dying prisoner really did not need to be shackled, so he ordered the prison guard to remove them. The two prison guards carried He Mo out of the prison gate and kindly removed his shackles! The shackles were removed, and the person died!</p>
<p>Because He Mo was "not guilty of his crime," he was unwilling to die with iron shackles? When I heard the news of his death, I did not shed tears for him. I just did not understand, because this was a "rare death."</p>

<h3 id="e258">Method of Producing Light Gas Ding Xi <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Take a basin, fill it with clean water, and then use pliers to take a piece of sodium. The molecular formula of sodium is Na, which is a metal element. It easily combines with air, so it must be immersed in kerosene when not in use to prevent it from combining with air and burning. Next, use scissors to cut the sodium into many small pieces, but each piece should not be too large; because if it is too large, it may explode when it burns in water. Then wrap each small piece of sodium in paper, but do not wrap it too tightly; because if it is wrapped too tightly, the light gas will be difficult to come out when it is placed in water. When wrapping the sodium in paper, be careful not to get the sodium on your hands, to avoid skin ulcers. After these procedures are completed, fill a test tube or a larger glass bottle with water, press the mouth of the tube tightly with the palm of your right hand, and turn it upside down in the water in the basin. Use your left hand to lift the tube, but do not lift it out of the water; because if it is lifted out of the water, the outside air will get in and drive out the water in the tube. Then, use the pliers in your right hand to clamp the paper-wrapped sodium one piece at a time under the mouth of the test tube. Once the sodium is clamped into the water, it will immediately decompose the water and turn into sodium hydroxide (molecular formula is NaOH), releasing hydrogen (molecular formula is H) that rises into the test tube and drives the water down. After the water in the tube is completely driven out, use a piece of glass to tightly cover the mouth of the bottle in the water, then take it out and turn it upside down on the table. Because light gas is lighter than air, it may rise and escape, so it must be placed upside down on the table. But even if it is upside down, the glass cover must not be removed. Then, gradually move the bottle up, and send a lit match into the mouth of the tube, which will emit a faint explosion. If a burning candle is sent into the mouth of the tube, a burning flame will be seen at the mouth of the tube, but the candle flame will be extinguished in the tube. This proves that light gas can burn in the air and does not have combustion-supporting properties.</p>

<p>On Edward Road, Tibet Road, and other relatively wide roads, you can always appreciate the unique "street literature."</p>
<p>These articles are mostly written on the road with chalk. Some are in Chinese, some are in Western languages. The Chinese ones include parallel prose, prose, ancient styles, and seven-character and five-character quatrains. As for the characters, many are written extremely vigorously and elegantly.</p>
<p>"I, a person from × place, graduated from ××× school at an early age, and then taught at × place. Due to bad luck and a family robbery, I am plagued by illness and have fallen into Shanghai. Relatives and friends are cut off, and I am whipped by hunger and cold. A man's spirit is short, and the money by the bed is exhausted. A strong man has no face, so Wu Yuan cannot but play the flute in the Wu market, and Feng Xuan cannot but pluck the sword at the Hou's gate. It is a last resort, and it is doubly heartbreaking. I dare to ask benevolent gentlemen to pity my situation and generously donate to revive the dried fish. I will definitely repay you one day. The afflicted person ××× tearfully begs."</p>
<p>This is one example. Beside this lingering and tragic "mourning notice," there are often one or two seven-character quatrains, five-character quatrains, or seven-character or five-character regulated verses.</p>
<p>"Drifting in Shanghai year after year, I look to the sky with white eyes;</p>
<p>Who recognizes the flute player in the Wu market? I can't bear to shed tears before you."</p>
<p>This is also an example. For example:</p>
<p>"The sun sets cold on the Wu River, and the sky is cold with crows flying in the evening;</p>

<h3 id="e260">"Monte Carlo" Yi Xin <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>"Monte Carlo" is a famous casino in Monaco, France. Those who go there to gamble are all high-ranking officials and wealthy people, because they have nothing to do all day long, so they gather there to gamble heavily.</p>
<p>In order to establish a large casino in Monaco, they, the casino operators, gave 400,000 pounds to the Prince of Monaco. This was in 1899. Later, in 1913, they gave him another 600,000 pounds, plus an annual rent of 50,000 pounds, and an additional 10,000 pounds every ten years until the end of the lease. Although they have to pay such an astonishing amount of money every year, they still think it is very profitable. Then who are the losers? Needless to say, it is the people who go there to gamble.</p>
<p>Shanghai is now becoming the second "Monte Carlo" quickly. Many women in high society go to casinos to gamble, and there are quite a few casinos, especially in the × concession, where even very famous people can be found. What is their purpose in going there? This is self-evident, but wealth is in the hands of fate and cannot be forced. Have you ever seen anyone become rich by gambling? Even if luck comes temporarily and they actually win, it will soon be a bubble. It comes from there and goes back there. The so-called "goods enter with a burst and also go out with a burst" is certain. In the end, they still try to steal a chicken but lose the rice. The saying "If you want to get rich, you must have bad luck" is really not wrong. Therefore, "gambling" is not a way to make money. Only "diligence" and "frugality" are the real ways to make money.

<p>× Prostitutes</p>
<p>There are approximately 100,000 prostitutes in this city, including "number two," "long three," "wild chickens," and those leading similar lives of prostitution. The direct and indirect living expenses required per person per day are approximately 1.20 yuan.</p>
<p>The total daily amount is 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The total monthly amount is 3.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>The total annual amount is 43.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>If there are 200,000 people, the total annual amount would be 86.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>If there are 300,000 people, the total amount would be 130 million yuan.</p>
<p>Plus 25% for luxury expenses, amounting to 32.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Adding this to the previous total, the total is 162.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>× The Establishment of the American Concession</p>
<p>According to H. B. Morse in his book "The International Relations of the Chinese Empire," the establishment of the American Concession was not created by human effort, but rather developed naturally. This statement makes a lot of sense. Because the merchants in the concession wanted to find cheap land for their residences, they bought land in the suburbs near the concession. The American Episcopal Church began to buy land and build churches in Hongkou. In Xianfeng four years (February 1854), the first American consul arrived in Shanghai and hoisted the American flag in the concession before the American Concession had even been demarcated.</p>
<p>The bishop of the American Episcopal Church was William J. Boone.</p>
<p>He asked the American consul to designate the southern boundary of the church. The American consul said that the small road along the river in front of the church would be the boundary. As a result, the Suzhou River bank belonged to the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>Initially, neither the American Concession nor the French Concession were prosperous places.</p>
<p>Later, the missionaries of the Jesus Church found a new site near the concession. The cornerstone of the Dongjiadu Catholic Church was laid on the 21st day of the 11th month of Daoguang twenty-eighth year.</p>
<p>Initially, the status of American expatriates was not very good, and even the American consul's desire to set up a consulate in the British Concession aroused the British's antipathy. It can be seen that the reason why the consuls of the United States and France asked the Chinese authorities to open another concession was actually because the British monopolized the British Concession, forcing them to open another concession to accommodate expatriates from the United States and France.</p>
<p>In fact, whether they were British, Americans, or French, they did not feel discriminated against by each other and were very harmonious, because they knew that their interests were the same: they were all imperialists who came to trample on Chinese soil and did not need to squeeze each other out! Therefore, in Tongzhi two years (1863), the British and American concessions were actually merged to form the current Public Concession.</p>

<h3 id="e263">New Trends in Divorce Procedures in Various Countries Fu Lan <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Postal divorces in Mexico have become popular nationwide recently. In addition, secret divorces can also be decided and approved by judges. As for cases that do not require debate, applicants do not even need to state the reasons specifically when submitting the petition.</p>
<p>Oklahoma, Arizona, and Idaho are particularly convenient for divorce. They have lenient laws, understanding judges, and even Arkansas, which uses hot springs as a divorce colony. Before submitting the petition, a residence of sixty days is required, and after submitting the petition, another thirty days of residence is required to wait for the final verdict to be issued. In Cuba, those requesting a divorce only need to reside for thirty days.</p>
<p>The divorce laws of Morelos state in Mexico are considered the simplest and easiest to achieve the purpose. Although the Mexican High Court ruled not long ago that anti-divorce in Morelos state is not effective outside the state, foreigners still rely on the help of lawyers and judges to come here to cancel their marriage contracts. Some states in Mexico have no divorce laws, and some states believe that there is no need for such laws. In many Mexican courts, the divorce petitions submitted are almost the same, with incompatibility or mutual consent as reasons, but most of them are unreliable. Since 1912, even the most hard-hearted Mexicans have been shocked by their postal divorces. Today, everyone is used to it and does not find it strange. The procedure is very simple. If one party wants a divorce, they only need to publish a notice in the newspaper. If the other party does not see this notice, it is their own loss. After the verdict is issued, a copy of the notice is sent to the other party, and the matter is completed.</p>
<p>Even the Chinese, who are under patriarchal society, have opened up a divorce avenue. According to the report of the Social Bureau last year, there were 853 divorce cases in Shanghai, 809 in Peiping, and 226 in Guangzhou. Divorce mainly occurs among foreigners and educated Chinese, while those who silently abide by the old etiquette and old ideas still dare not try it.</p>
<p>Russia still holds the record for swift divorces. There is a divorce bureau in any big city or town. Either party can apply for a divorce without stating the reason or notifying the other party. In fact, the required procedure takes only five minutes. Therefore, a large line of people often stands in front of the window of the divorce bureau, waiting for half an hour to get what they want. Because Russian law does not allow counterclaims and defenses, there is no need for judges or lawyers. It is neither expensive nor delayed, so it is no wonder that Russians flock to it. If there are children, the issue of alimony must be determined within three days after the divorce. The court will rule which party will raise the children, which party will be responsible for the alimony, and how much alimony should be paid. In some places, when there is no legal provision for alimony, it is borne jointly by both men and women, but in reality, wives rarely pay. In one hundred divorce cases with children, children are assigned to the mother in 95% of the cases. According to observers, the divorce rate in Russia in the first year of marriage is five times higher than in the United States, but after ten years of marriage, their rate of breaking up couples is only twice as high as in the United States.</p>
<p>In the courts of old Russia, if a complete divorce case was tried, solemn regalia had to be displayed, and two monks and two or more pastors had to rush from Moscow and St. Petersburg to participate in the trial and conduct a long-term investigation of the case. Today, however, one person stuffs a piece of paper out of a window hole, and the divorce procedure is completed.</p>
<p>Before 1916 in Turkey, husbands had the right to drive out his wife at any time without notice. Conversely, women had to appear in court and prove their allegations before obtaining a divorce. But since the Young Turk movement and the establishment of the new country, the law has been amended to give women extra convenience, explaining that marriage is a joint contract between men and women. Currently, Turkish women can enjoy all the rights that men enjoy in marriage, including the right to divorce. According to scholars, Islamic law, except for marriage and divorce, often treats women more favorably than general Western codes. However, they are now being amended to ensure that women receive the same wages as men, and whether married or unmarried, they can choose any job.</p>
<p>This summer, India promulgated new divorce regulations. From then on, Indian women can divorce their husbands because of laziness, refusal to support, frequent bad tempers, or unchaste behavior.</p>
<p>Although the divorce procedures in various countries are becoming simpler, some countries still refuse to accept them. Brazil does not recognize divorce at all, and does not recognize bigamy as legal. It is said that Rio de Janeiro is currently drafting a divorce law, all based on the United States. Also, according to the recent regulations of a certain cathedral, any person whose previous marriage has been declared terminated by a civil court and invalidated by a monk can be married by the pastor of the cathedral, as if they had never been married before.</p>
<p>Although Belgium is a Catholic country, it has recognized divorce since 1830. Today, the Netherlands allows foreigners to reside for three months to enjoy the convenience of divorce.</p>
