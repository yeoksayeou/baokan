<h3 id="c24">整頓敎育之根本問題文 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>隔昨三中全會。第四次集會於確定敎育標準。改善敎育制度改善高等敎育諸問題。均有明確之决議。其内容爲㈠關於國民敎育。㈡關於生産敎育。㈢關於師資敎育。㈣關於人才敎育且各臚列辦法。揭舉標的。在當前敎育瀕於整個破産之局勢下。而有如斯整頓敎育之明確决議。斯誠足以令日夕憂慮於「國本動搖」者爲之色然而喜。深致欣幸於今後我國敎育之庶幾其有整飭之望。雖然吾人仍請以一言廣之。</p>
<p>第一。吾人認敎育爲整個政治中之一部門敎育之良窳。即與整個政治息息相關。故欲整飭敎育。不僅在於改革敎育制度。樹立敎育標的等局部問題。其尤要者乃在於整個政治之澄清。此爲一大前提不容忽視。</p>
<p>第二。我國今日文盲人數。約占全人口百分之八十以上。民衆敎育之推進。固爲至急之圖。但文盲數字所以如此其鉅大者。其根因不在於人民之不欲受敎育。而實在於無受敎育之機會即就當前之事實而言。飢荒連歲。戰亂迭作。農村經濟。日益破産。人民生計。日趨艱難老弱轉徙。少壯流離。生且無方。遑言敎育。故義務敎育之推行固急。而民生之安定尤急。民生如不得安定。則義務敎育即能踐實推進。亦終必徒勞無功。是亦「富矣而後敎之」之義也</p>
<p>第三。我國生産落後。爲顯著之事實。今後應注重生産敎育。以求産業之發達。固亦爲根本之要國。不過吾人認爲我國生産之所以落後。其根因實不在於未能着重生産敎育。就當前之事實言。吾人嘗見有多數機械。採礦。工程。數理等等之科學專家竟不能得一業。或旣得業而所用常非其所學。反之無一技之長。無一得之知者。則常無往而不適。就此種現象推斷。則即使産業敎育實行。各種專門人材。皆次第養成。遂謂我生産。即可因而發達。人能用其所學以爲國盡力。恐亦不免失之太爲樂觀。蓋我國生産之落後。其最大之根因。實由於資本主義經濟之握持桎梏也。</p>
<p>第四。邇年以來。學潮迭作。彼伏興。常相應和。聞者疾首。言者痛心。輒曰學生囂張。學風敗壞。是應嚴予管束。嚴加制裁。固矣然而吾人。認爲學潮之作。要有其誘致之因。學風之敗壞。亦當有其致此之由。外侮内亂。交相煎逼。使學生不能安心求學。一也。現實政治不能予學生以良好之觀感。二也。敎育經費。常起恐慌。三也。官僚制度侵入敎育界。四也。新思想潮流之激盪。五也。曉此五因則吾人又可知今日而欲弭止學潮。整頓學風。徒從管束制裁着手。亦爲末道或恐學潮將以管束而愈滋。學風將以整飭而愈肆。蓋不正其本。决無以資其末也。</p>
<p>第五。「敎育經費絕對獨立。」邇年來當局。固已一再宣示。然而事實上則敎費仍常積欠。一任學校關門。敎員枵腹。靑年失學。全國敎育界號泣呼籲而都無以應。鉅額之軍費不能减緩。而敎費則一任其長年拖欠。如言整頓敎育。則此應即爲最大之課題。亦即爲嚴重之事實。整頓之工作。應以此爲第一着。如其不能。則一切整頓之决議。其將不流爲空談者幾希。</p>
<p>凡右所陳。吾人認爲實深關當前整頓敎育之根本要圖。而其他皆爲枝節。故讀三中全會關於敎育之决議案而後。輒復略　陳之。</p>

<p>（乙）「設經濟參謀部、實行統制經濟」國民同盟所倡之統制經濟、則以國民公益之統制爲本、反對共産主義、而統制範圍則應時勢而定、（一）「統制大綱」㈠首要商業及銀行盡爲統制、㈡管理匯兌及貿易、保持一定之物價、㈢設新土地制度、收買土地再轉賣農民、㈣國家管理米穀及蠶絲、㈤制定農業保險法、㈥統制日滿經濟、（二）整理國民之負債、（三）建設新海洋交通政策、</p>

<p>此點極關重要、瀋陽附近之所謂炸裂事件、如不能認爲日軍在附近各處軍事行動之合法理由、則同時日軍在數百哩外之中國其他各處、如長春吉林營口等地之軍事行爲、當然更不能認爲合理、日軍攻擊華軍營、並放火焚燒之、而華軍則固曾奉令不得對日軍衝突者、此點報吿書中亦曾道及矣、日本當局對於剷除東三省之中國文官、不遺餘力、報吿書中對此亦甚加注意、九月三十日國聯行政院通過决議案後、正在該議案之有效時間、日本對東三省華人文官勢力之摧殘、進行尤猛、吾人試觀該决議案之内容、其第二節則云、『行政院對於日本政府之聲明、謂對於東省並無圖謀領土之意、認爲重要、』其第三節則云、『行政院知悉日本代表之聲明、謂日本軍隊業經開始撤退、日本政府當以日本人民生命財産之安全有切確之保證爲比例、仍繼續將其軍隊從速撤退至鐵路區域以内、並希望從速完全寳行此項旨願、』其第五節則云、『行政院知悉中日代表已保證各該國政府採取一切必要步驟、以防止事變之擴大、或情勢之愈加嚴重、』此項决議案、係由日本所接受、然事實昭示於吾人者、則爲何如乎、中國遼寗省政府之官員、如代理主席財政廳長敎育廳長公安局長等等、被日軍之壓迫、不得不退出省政府所在地之瀋陽、而避至瀋陽以西數十哩之錦州城、報吿書中稱、日本不准中國當局避出瀋陽以至錦州設立省政府、且設法以毁滅之十月八日、日軍飛機即從事轟炸錦州省政府所在地之交通大學、火車站、樹有紅十字旗之醫院、及其他絕無武裝之各地點、日機低飛時更作機關槍之掃射、是日本用意、在完全掃除中國當局之勢力、彰彰明甚、而此種中國當局、其對於南滿之政府組織及治安維持上實均爲不可缺者也、錦州吉林及滿洲其他各處之華當局勢力、逐一被日軍消滅後、日方乃從事歎惜痛恨滿洲各處之無秩序、日方目的、無非在取華當局而代之、此項目的、</p>
<p>中國知之、而日本則否認之、其裝腔作調、國聯行政院及大會殆已熟見之矣、日首相犬養毅於一九三一年十二月曾表示、中國即以滿洲奉送、日本亦决不接受、然同時各中立新聞機關如聯合新聞社路透電報社等、則不斷的報吿日當局竭力直接的或由其傀儡間接的攫奪滿洲治權之事實、余之所以請諸君對一九三一年十月八日轟炸錦州事件、及其後錦州乃至滿洲其他各行政中心被佔據事件、特别注意者、其原因即在指出日當局之絕無誠意、一方面斷續阻撓本案之和平解决、一方面更對國聯盟約及其他法理加以踐踏也、日本藐視國聯尊嚴之結果、其所加於中國人民之痛苦、不知凡幾、余亦不願詳細指述、重增在場諸君之不安、惟有一二點可道者、試爲諸君陳之、日本先於九月三十日、旋復於十二月十日、對國聯保證不再作任何行動以增加事件之嚴重性、所謂任何行動者、當然包括殺人流血事件之導火行爲在内、然保證儘保證、而行爲自行爲、在中國近代史中、中國土地上及行政上主權之所受攻擊、當以日本此次暴行爲最、日本軍事行動、已將三千萬中國民衆與其大部同胞隔絕、東三省效忠於政府之官員、悉被除名、而代以日本之傀儡、東三省之關務鹽務機關、悉被强佔、郵局電線礦産鐵道無綫電台及稅收機關以及稅收、悉被攫奪、至今日而任何行政方策、未得日方允許、萬萬不能在東三省實行、凡此種種、日本違反其對國聯莊嚴之保證、而獨斷獨行之繼續的恐怖政策及同化政策之表現也、調調團報吿書一二七有云、</p>
<p>『日本軍隊未經宣戰、將向來毫無疑義屬於中國領土之一大部份地面、强奪佔領、使其與中國分離、並宣布獨立、事實具在、此事經過所採之步驟、日本謂爲合於國聯盟約·非戰公約·及華盛頓九國條約之義務、而實則各該約之意義、正在防止此種行爲、』</p>
<p>不特此也、一九三二年一月二十八日、日本更繼續侵略華土、進攻上海、殺傷華人二萬四千餘人、毁滅並未武裝之城之上海及其附近各處之財産、價値至十五萬萬元之鉅、駐滬之新中國軍隊、即與日軍接觸、其抵抗成績、不啻對有關各方作一通吿、謂中國人民固能極度容忍而採取消極抵抗、然亦能奮發有爲、作强有力之武裝自衛、然日軍雖在滬遭遇惡運、並不中止其野心、其一意孤行、更可於其公然承認所謂「滿洲國政府」之一舉中見之、日本承認「滿洲國、」乃在本年九月十四日與僞組織訂定所謂議定書、蓋已完全不顧其對國聯盟約及其他國際條約之義務、及其屢次對行政院之諾言矣、關於東三省狀况以至「滿洲國」之被日本承認、調查團報吿書九十七頁有言云、</p>
<p>『故獨立運動、於一九三一年九月以前、在滿洲從未聽得、所以能有此項運動者、僅由於日本軍隊在塲、甚爲明顯、與第四章所述日本新政治運動有密切關係之現任或已退職之日本文武官吏、曾考量組織並實行此項運動、認爲一種解决九月十八日事變後滿洲局面之方法、該官吏等利用某種華人之名義及舉動、並利用不滿從前政府之少數居民、企圖達到上述目的、日本參謀本部自始或至少在短時期内、明瞭此項自治運動之可以利用、又毫無疑義、故該部對於獨立運動之組織份子、予以援助及指導、調查團認爲滿意者、即依各方所得一切證據、確信助成滿洲國成立之原動力、雖有若干種、但其中兩種、即一爲日本軍隊之在塲、一爲日本文武官吏之活動、兩者聯合發生之效力最大、依我等之判斷、若無此兩者新國家不能成立、基此理由現在政體不能認爲由眞正的及自然的獨立運動所産生、』（未完）</p>

<p>日軍係取報復手段</p>
<p>九月十六日、我國撫順同胞近三千人、爲日本軍隊屠殺一節、已於十一月三十日由美國國際新聞社訪員漢特氏ＥdwardＨunter向紐約所發一電、予以證實、因漢特氏曾親往撫順屠殺地點、切實調查也、我政府於獲悉該屠殺消息後、曾向日本政府提出抗議、並報吿國聯、但日本政府對此竟予否認、茲特譯錄外人之紀述如次、以見第三者固有公正之報吿也、</p>
<p>撫順三千人之大屠殺、男女老幼、無所幸免、乃係確實事實、余刻正返至該處、見其繁榮景象、乃由於舉世最大之已開採煤礦中所獲財富、余巡視附近一帶後、發見當地房屋、均爲日軍從火焚燒、居民均由日軍集於一處、用機關槍屠殺、狀極可憫、一切均爲余所目擊、及聞自難民者、證據確鑿、無容置辯、遭難村落所殘留之朝天之磚泥牆壁、爲火薫成黑色、狀如伸出悲慘之臂、屋宇之棟樑、均化爲灰燼、遭難村落中未死之中國農人·工人·及婦孺、所述該事經過、莫不相同、日軍抵該地後、以牲畜視村民、驅之集於豢養牲畜之圍欄中、然後携至附近之山坡、加以屠殺、同時以煤油焚燒村人之住所、</p>

<p>在去年上學期，我曾有一種企圖，預備寫中國農村經濟一書，曾成緒論七萬多字，可惜，一二八之役，與學校同歸於盡。不過，這企圖始終在腦筋中，沒有一日消滅過。因此，凡與這問題有關聯的，我總加以深切的注意。無疑地，農村問題中，亦就是中國問題中，「普及敎育」實是當前急迫的問題。據統計所示，國民有百分之九十三均是不識字的，現在一般有識之士，均能感覺到本問題的重要而致力，尤其是定縣的平民敎育促進會及上海中華職業敎育社的努力，不得不算是中國農村敎育前途一線曙光。</p>
<p>可是，在另一方面，普及義務敎育，在鄉村中究能收到幾多效力？在現下環境下，我可有點懷疑。據經騐所示，在義校讀書的，往往是絕對少數。我覺得，鄉村中的義校，在日中授課，則容易與工作發生衝突：夜中，則一日勞作，晚餐後，即倒頭便臥·十二小時的工作，再呌他用惱二小時，在事實上是不可能，亦是不應該的。我們即單指學齡兒童而論、據我在鄉村中談話所得，亦往往是不願送子弟入學。</p>
<p>其原因是在現在經濟環境下，以一人的收入來維持一家的生計，是多麽的困難。因此，我們那邊，小兒有八九歲時，就出外看牛，至女兒則大都送人作養媳婦。因爲多一人的消費，在反一面即少一人的生産；八九歲小兒固不能望其生産，然因給人牧牛，他自己的生活問題即可解决，無須父母去維持。在大部份的農村家庭中，即少至一小孩的生活，亦是難以維持的。育嬰堂數目的增多，是很淺近的證據，因此，即使實行義務敎育，要其自願送子弟入學，豈是可能。要實行强迫敎育，即使可能，因此而引起的生活問題又將何以解决。「讀書可以的，生活怎樣呢？」我每每聽到類此的談話。</p>
<p>我們再退一步，使農村子弟六歲後即進校，讀到十歲爲止。這在事實上比較容易辦到。但這四年敎育，究能得到些什麽？何况，往往至多八歲，父兄也必須其作生産的一份子呢？</p>
<p>但是，敎育的急應普及，在各方面看：都是眼前急迫的問題。難關必須將其打破，可是怎樣打破呢？我們假定實行普及敎育，在經費方面已有相當的解决，但，怎樣能達到普及的目標？怎樣能使父兄們願意送子弟入學，而不致與生活發生衝突？這些都是問題。</p>
<p>要回答上面的問題，很漂亮地我們可說，這在私有經濟下，是必然的現象，因此，我們必須打破現在經濟組織，才能達到。但這未免有點好高務遠，眼前的急迫問題，必須在眼前打破。理論上的見解同時亦須顧到現實性的。</p>
<p>我覺得這不只是我個人問題，凡曾從事於鄉村敎育過的，恐怕誰都有這懷疑。因此，我不揣冒眛，敢提出請求先生回答。如能公之於大衆，亦是我所深望的。（鮑祖宣君來信）</p>

<h3 id="c157">女子與職業 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>我出嫁已有三年了，現在有着一個兩歲的孩子。我的丈夫在一家洋行裏當寫字。因爲人口少，嚼用輕，所以日子也算寬裕。：：：我總以爲過着這一日三餐的生活實在太無聊，：：：女子也應該有個職業。：：：我在未嫁前雖曾讀過幾年書，但毅不上說有職業技能，所以我打算再去上學，將來可去找個相當職業。我曾把這意思向他說，不料他非常反對，他說，女子旣出嫁了，便毋須職業，「洗衣，煮飯，生小囝」便是她的職業。先生，這不是太侮辱女性了嗎？我曾和他鬧了幾次，終無效果；但是錢是在他手裏，我除了向他要求有什麽别法呢？因此我更覺到有經濟獨立的必要。）：：：先生，你看怎麽好呢？（敖婉瑩女士來訊）</p>
<p>（答）「女子應該有個職業」自是卓識：比了時下一般婦女只知消費不能生産的確乎高出萬倍。女士的要求當然是正當的。但我們提倡女子職業或女子經濟獨立，其含義並不是籠統的。一般的意見，女子職業或女子經濟獨立似乎向男子方面取一種對抗的意義；這實在是一種誤解。正確地說，消極地反對女子的倚賴生活，如寄生蟲般增加社會的消費，積極地提倡女子參加社會生産事業，不論是直接或間接。我們希望女子本着人類互助的精神參加生産，可决不願女子有］爭雄或不示弱的心理。在這點上，我們應該把數千年男女之别的觀念完全消除掉。我們只都是人：我們只是各盡所能罷了。如若一定要爭着做男人的事，把女人應該做的事或非女人不能做的事棄去不做，這便和生産的基本原則丨分功的道理相違了。至於「洗衣，煑飯，生小囝」便是女子職業的話誠然在措辭上「侮辱女性的，但在意義上並沒有。「洗衣，煑飯，生小囝」確乎是女人的事，但這些事並不一定下賤，治理家政和國元首的治理國家大事，在生産的意義上，並不分什麽高下，或許還基本些。兒童敎育，關係國家民族的前途更巨。不幸現在的學校敎育，只有啓迪的功能，對於陶養的功能，是完全缺乏的：那麽，這偉大的責任，除了一般的母親以外還有誰担負得起？如若一個女子能盡心盡力敎育自己的子女，使他們成爲完美的國民，比棄了子女去賺一月幾十元的薪金的事，偉大的多了丨女士若明白了自己責任的偉大和重要，定能發生興味。况且現在自己操着家政，孩子年齡還小，自然覺得經濟寬裕。一旦上學以後，家中勢必添僱僕役，再</p>
<p>加學費的支出，憑空添出兩種担負，這是很不合算的。假若感覺讀書的必要，不妨置備書籍，在暇時自修。總之，互助的精神，是一切事業成功的要點；「和他鬧」是大家無益的。</p>

<p>（一）救國的三個大問題</p>
<p>國家到了這樣危險的地位、恐怕末有一個人不想救她因爲不救、就要亡國、到了亡國的時期、諸君雖有熱烈的心腸、恐怕也來不及、至少出要像印席一樣經過很長久的奴隸時代、做過奴隸以後、我們很光明的中華民旗歷史上、就發生了汚點、這是永久不能磨滅的現在末有亡國的時候　留着救國的機會、所以我們立刻應該决定救國的二個人問題、</p>
<p>第一·是誰來首先負起責任來實行救國、</p>
<p>第二·是如何來救國、</p>
<p>第三·是確定一個共同救國的時期與目標、</p>
<p>中國的人民號稱四萬萬、在事實上决不能全部人民都來參加救國、且拿政學農工商五界的人民來研究一下就覺得學界中的大中學生、在地位上責任上、及價値上都有首先應當負起這救國的責任所以我先拿大中學生的地位、責任、及價値、來說明一下就可明白、</p>
<p>（二）大中學生的地位</p>
<p>政府目下决不能自動救國因爲他們自動的財政·軍事外交·交通·四件大事末有解决以前、决不能來解决人民的敎育·農業·工業·商業·四件大事、雖然明知末有實業不能生存末有敎育不能立國的道理、但是因爲自己事忙、實在是處於有心無力的地位、明白這個道理那末我們可以不必完全依賴政府、更不必責難政府、那末應當如何呢、應當請求政府爲我們提倡我們能力所及確有把握的事、然後我們在政府督促之下、來建設我們的前程、</p>
<p>再看全國的農民、是有體力而無智力的、有良心而　實力的、有勤檢耐勞的美德商無向前奮鬥的能力的、在未受敎育以前、不能來參加救國、再看全國的工人、是與農民同一命　、正忙着求生有與求生活、　無暇來參加救國、再看全國的商人、與一班最有勢力的新銀行家　新實　家、都團緊在幾個有租界的商埠内、各各建造他們的金塔銀庫恐怕也未必能來提倡救國、</p>
<p>政府不能救國、農人工人商人也不來救國、到底誰來負　這任重道遠的救國工作呢、我思來想去、祇得來請求全國的入中學生來發動　這救國的工作、</p>
<p>諸位同學們、你們是全國中受過高等敎育的人、是素稱　能愛國而有熱血的人、你們是體格健全頭腦清醒的人你們是比較生計畫立的人、你們是每一萬人中一個做領袖的人所以我認定受過高中以上敎育的人、就是負救國重任的人、倘然你們再不出來救國、是路與政府及愚昧的人民一樣的無能、以後不必駡政府、　政府就是駡自己、以後也不必笑人家笑人家就是笑自己、倘然你們也不肯負責來救國、中國是必亡無疑、所以我渴望諸同學做些驚天動地的事蹟來、雖然目下身居於黑暗的社會、守舊的家庭腐化的政府之下、胸中的　悶憂鬰、比任何人爲大、但是千萬不要灰心、走入自希自滅　浪淫佚的途中、因爲自殺荒淫、多是極端沉悶時代的一種不可避免的社會病態、但是終要努力前程負起改善的責任、才不失靑年志士的本色、我們旣說明諸君救國的地位、再請講講諸君的責任、</p>
<p>（三）大中學生的責任</p>
<p>我們有極廣大的地土、但是遍處是匪、所以興農業是諸君的責任、我們有極衆多的人民、但是大部份是不　不知、所以辦敎育是諸君的責任、我們有無窮盡的寳藏、但是深埋地下、所以開礦産是諸君的責任、我們的數千年文代與歷史、但是事事落後、所以提倡科學是諸君的責任、我們有强鄰的壓迫但是無人能禦所以改良軍事是諸位的責任、我們有經濟的侵略、不能自救所以創辦實業是諸君的責任、這不是一句空言可以了事、必須要集合無數的農業家·敎育家·工程家·科學家·軍事家·及實業家·同心協力來舉辦、始可成功、諸君都是專們人才、這種責任、在諸君求學的時候、早早的由諸君自己故在自己身上、所以諸君是遲早要負起這責任的但是先决問題、是整個的敎育問題、目下有無數眞才實學的專門人才、畢業以後、得不到相當的地位、發展他們的才能因大部份的人民、不受敎育、内地是不能興發内地不能興發、就末有都大事業可做、未有事業、於人才不生需要、所以千百成萬的高等人才、集於都會之中、人浮於事、以致造成事非所用用非所學的可悲局面、所以惟有這敎育救國的工作、實實在在可以造成無數　　人才的機會與出路、這才是諸君的重大責任、</p>

<p>江南八大學足球錦標賽數　循環、Ｉ達　兵相見時期曁南復日各以不敗之成績相見、大有解决錦標之氣概、雙方所餘者、僅交大一對敵耳、日再戰交大、昨日執行裁裁者王復旦雙方陣線如下、</p>
<p>曁南大學</p>
<p>雲逢　　　　王南珍</p>
<p>尙動　　　　　　　張鴻藻</p>
<p>謝全和　　　　　梁樹棠　　　羅尙究</p>
<p>賴作容　　　　　　　陳鎭祥</p>
<p>鄧漢傑（上）劉祖侃</p>
<p>麥廷琳（下）</p>
<p>復旦大學</p>
<p>龔以恂、（上）</p>
<p>張容　　安炳武（上）何基棠（下）</p>
<p>楊銘金　　　　　王正寅（下）材炳成</p>
<p>關洵安　王樹森　　　余順章</p>
<p>馮念漢　　　周紹文</p>
<p>李琳</p>
<p>（一守一攻）三四千球迷圍住之中、開始作戰、曁南卽下總攻之令、但屢次進逼、屢爲阻退、關洵安在後左顧右防、煞費心機、楊銘金亦小心守關、曁南猛攻之二十分鐘後、一無成就、漸現懈態、復旦於此時機開始推進直逼曁南門前、但或以起脚過慢、或以攻射無的、亦徒見廢　而歸、在此半小時中、一攻一守、一進一退、竟毫無成績、羅海光發憤、連連遠射球門門遠力藩、至此才有新發展、</p>
<p>（海光連中）悶沉之局勢、於上半時最　之十分鐘、才得打破、雲逢　過場橫送劉祖侃得之而直進、後衛趕來、劉不待其至、已送落門前、張鴻藻單人直闖關洵安之一阻、張未射而身已先倒、楊銘金　出太近、海光在人隙中、一射中的、曁南以一比零先開紀錄、復旦雖開球再攻、又爲曁南所得、劉祖侃在右邊進取、斜襄一送、王南珍於左翼接應、關洵安飛出、梁樹棠截得遠射、恰中門上彈回、張鴻藻意欲再攻、爲關所阻、盤海光路來一撥而進、又三分鐘、上半時完畢、曁南勝二比零</p>
<p>（南珍頭頂）復旦並以連失二球而失其戰心積極反攻一如從前、五虎齊攻、進叩城門、余順章深人重防、前顧無人正可一舉而中豈知空門不射、飛出木外、可惜可惜、時曁南五鋒之位置、已互相對調、劉祖侃居王南珍位、陳鎭祥外調、張鴻藻墊陳位、王南珍居劉内、張鴻藻時居右翼幾度盤旋、對門一脚、王南珍足不停步、迎上一頂、球飛進網、下半時開始僅五分鐘、</p>
<p>（再來一個）三球連中、復旦仍立意一破彼方之門、機會有之、失於運氣亦失自己之脚頭、林炳成對門猛攻、急如矢、無奈相差二寸、中於門上彈落、余順章在右方向中送球、門前無人、接應者竟無人接得、任其漏去、可惜可惜羅海光則出塲加油、果然又來一個、曁南再中第四球完畢、</p>
<p>（大家和氣）昨日雙方精神均佳、極融洽之至、失敗者、雖敗仍力爭得勝者雖勝仍不弛、戰鬥精神、良可嘉許、殊願長以保持、復旦失敗、咎有所歸、動作稍遲、失機不少、後衛則堅强可取、優者獲勝、理之常、復旦亦甘心屈服也、</p>

<p>（持志能守不能攻）持志知賊之厲害、監守之嚴密、出手之迅速、以截其手中之球、爲海賊本年第一次所嘗滋味、上半時中、海賊進攻甚烈、探籃之機會則少無奈持志能守不能攻、一球在手、立即遠射、十九失的、楊錢二鋒、年前百發百中之威風、已化爲烏有衆後衛中的數次、否則更是海賊世界矣、</p>
<p>（僅五分鐘之緊張）海賊開塲、史密斯先中希爾繼之、一刹那成七比零、孔廣益遠中二分、海賊又以十比二前去、此後之五分鐘爲最可觀之戰局、夏氏兄、弟、接連中的二次、頓時以八比十追上、僅差二分矣然此五分鐘一過、局面又非、上半時結局、十六比九下半時起持志先中二分、海賊則連得十分之多成二十六比十一、於是不可挽回、四十比二十五完畢、</p>

<p>昨日糖市以標金復漲至八百二十餘兩、公會人氣頓見緊張、二十四號粗砂白劃十五兩六錢、比前日（二十）升起一錢、十八號中砂白亦升一錢、劃十四兩半、八九十號荷赤　平定、無甚上落新潮靑前日恒生輪入口又到一千六百餘包積底雖有增厚、然據昨日産地電訊辦價反趨挺勢、後市看緊、而此間銷路亦尙活潑、故號盤頗爲穩定、昨開出一千餘包、較高之貨開八兩九錢、比前日升起五分、最次者爲八兩四錢、後市或有轉好之望、</p>
<p>又據紐約二十一日電、現貨糖市平穩每磅價仍爲八角一分二五、期貨十二·一·三·五月各小二磅音、七·九月各小一磅音、又倫敦十二·五月各大半便士、三月漲七五、瓜哇白糖、近遠期均小三便士、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、英莊錦降同孚天祥等行、均因摩洛哥電報轉滬、紛起動辦、全市成交共達五百餘箱、婺莊抽芯貨、頂盤售開一百二十五兩普通貨、售價六十八兩至七十七兩、較前無甚變動、貢熙珠茶兩項、白頭行家略有進胃、惟售價較前見跌二三兩、其餘針眉秀眉等花色、均無交易云、</p>
<h3 id="c211">人造絲銷路不寂 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>昨日本埠人造絲市客銷頻不寂寞、緣煙靑帮繼起抛購、昨日公會Ａ級金麒麟黑美女及頭二號紅魚牌等一二兩月份期貨、抛成六十五箱、價仍平定、</p>
<h3 id="c212">五金五金被外匯帶高 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>昨日外匯頻緊、五金進貨結價增高不少、故市塲各標凖挺進不已其如馬口鐵·新鉛絲·白鐵瓦·平白鐵·鋼條·生鐵以及洋元方板等鐵品、莫不節節　展但實交方面、並不因此生色、良以年關在邇金融收束所致、惟銀根富裕之囤户、新近頗有收買現貨積囤心思、蓋外滙緊定價高、申市低而存底淺、苟實交一動、供求不接、行情飛漲可以預算也、</p>

<p>久少到貨之湖南純銻、昨太古棧裝到十二噸、（計一百二十箱、）查係法界某五金號購來云、</p>

<p>大行家關住居奇</p>
<p>小店家吃虧不少</p>
<p>開平烟煤塊、前因　煤　銷、公司削價賤賣、每噸祇售六兩半、近來市塲現貨流動、　感缺乏、一般同行店家、一時頗難購得、考其原因、蓋公司到貨、均被各大行家預先定去、關住居奇、是以售價暗漲、昨市塲呌開價格、公司盤予仍呌六兩半、但無貨成交、而各行家賣出者、每噸竟超過七兩以外、據一般人之觀察、在國歷新年中、還須上漲云、</p>

<p>— 衡</p>
<p>從那一天起，小阿毛抵死也不肯再踏進有高門盤的牆門去。</p>
<p>他今年纔十二歲，有一個以前是銅匠，而現在是洋鉛匠的父親。父親有一個給繞酒燻紅了的鼻子；他自己底鼻子却因爲衣穿不夠而一年裏倒也有三季是紅着，不但紅，而且還不斷地流鼻涕。至於母親，在他小小的記憶裏却壓根兒就沒有這麽回事。簡單說，他們祇有兩個：父親跟兒子，兒子跟父親。兩個在一塊兒吃，一塊兒睡覺。</p>
<p>而父親照例是那副愛喝酒的漢子底脾氣。白天要兒子做差不多是一個大人纔做得了的事情。在他想，小阿毛已經流上了十多年的鼻涕，不算小；假如到眞做不了的時候，一個嘴巴就會帮助他做了的。到夜裏自己像一頭蠢牛似地攤了大半舖，把小的祇擠在一隻角落上，不能睡而且也不能動；天上剛透白，就把他從發着酒氣和汗臭的被窩裏一脚踼出去，好讓自己舒舒服服地獨自個睡到大天光。</p>
<p>對於這一切，小阿毛從來不反抗，而且無論打也好，駡也好，他從來不哭一聲。</p>
<p>他們父子倆是這樣地活下去，在一條破敗的小巷中的一問最破敗的　子裏，偷偷地，單調而又孤寂，像被全人類所忘了似地。</p>
<p>但是有一些照例的人家，每當需要裝一個天窗成是修一個　　的時候，却總會把銅匠阿發想起來。</p>
<p>在這樣的日子，我們便會看到小阿毛背上掮着比他自己底身子小不了多少的長鐵筒，跟在空着雙手的父親後面，跨三步跑兩步地走進那些高門　裏去。他看父親做生活，給父親遞鎚子，遞剪刀。不需要遞剪刀或是鎚子的時候，他呆呆地站着，看看這，看看那。</p>
<p>他底眼睛却是靈活的，靈活而且深。</p>
<p>那一天也一樣。那一天冷，他祇穿着單薄的棉襖褲，他像一頭煨灶貓似地蹲在父親做生活用爐子邊，臉上和袖口上鼻涕縱橫。他在等待父親底號令，以及往往會跟了號令來的暴栗。「加炭！」號令來了。</p>
<p>小阿毛惟恐不及，急忙用小手抓起了一把大火鉗。</p>
<p>且說那人家有個差不多也是　十歲的女孩子。小阿毛在拿火鉗的怱忙中不經意用袖口來觸着了她底衣襟。那女子很快地縮了回去，瞧瞧他，　一種　女性的動作　出一塊手帕來在衣襟上拭了好一會。</p>
<p>「齷齪，眞討厭！」像是在對自己說。</p>
<p>他想回答，「哪一個呌你走來？」然而眼前有爹爹在，他沒　敢這樣做。</p>
<p>他祇用深的眼光來歐住她。</p>
<p>那女孩子身上自然是怪乾凈，頭髮梳得油光光，臉上竟跟時髦的少女一樣地塗滿了粉和臙脂。活像個小妖精，小阿毛心裏想；他記得父親是時常把打扮得狠闊氣的娘兒們呌做妖精的。然而祇是想，他底氣一下子還是平不下去。「你媽是：：：」他更惡意地想，然而氣還是照樣的氣。</p>
<p>阿發爬上了瓦　。</p>
<p>「把爐子捕抽𤆦，」他在上面喊。</p>
<p>小阿毛在下面嘘呼喊呼地抽起風箱來。他一邊抽，一邊在留心。起先抽得很慢，可是等到「小妖精」走近來的時候，他却使勁地向裏面一推。</p>
<p>「該死的！」那一個鬼呌一樣地駡着。</p>
<p>看「小妖精」吹了一身灰，他心裏縱舒服；「你自己凑上來，」他勝利地說。</p>
<p>「這地方是我們的，又不是你的，難道我倒來不得！」</p>
<p>「我們做生活。」</p>
<p>「小鬼，你做生活就封王！」</p>
<p>聽到這一聲「小鬼，」小阿毛立刻把眼睛睜圓，停下了抽風箱的手；要不是那女孩子很快地給裏面呌了進夫的話，那就誰也料不到他是會怎樣回答的。</p>
<h3 id="c240">文明利器 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 葉聖陶</p>
<p>以前，商店逢到「特别大減價」「多少週紀念」的時候，就僱幾名軍樂隊（樂字通常念作快樂的樂）吹吹打打，借此吸引過路人的注意。現在，這辦法似乎淘汰了。只在偏僻的小馬路上，還偶爾有幾家背時的小商店送出喇叭和　笛的合奏，調子是「毛毛雨」或者「妹妹我愛你。」過路人知道是怎麽一回事，頭也不回地走過了。這寂寞的音樂只有屋簷下的布市招寂寞地聽着。</p>
<p>現在，上海的商店有了另外的引人注意的辦法。即使並非「特别大減價」「多少週紀念，」他們也要裝一具收音機在當門的簷下。好在播音臺是那麽多，從清早到深夜可以不間斷地收音，他們就一直把機關開着。於是，電車汽車聲鬧成一片的空間，又攙入了三絃叮咚的「彈詞，」癩皮聲音的「哭妙根篤爺，」老槍喉嚨的「毛毛雨」和「妹妹我愛你，」諸如此類。</p>
<p>但是，這辦法也未必眞能引人注意。只在新流行的一些時，裝有收音機的商店前站着幾個抬頭獃望的過路人。後來就同僱幾名軍樂隊吹吹打打的一樣，你儘管「彈詞」：：：「妹妹我愛你，」過路人還是走他的路。看看店裏的伙計，似乎也沒有一個在那里聽這些「每天的老調。」那末，收音機收了音究竟給誰聽呢？這大概只有市招知道了。然而新裝收音機的還陸續有得增加，好像沒有收音機就失了大商店的體統了。</p>
<p>我家左鄰有一具收音機，發音清楚而宏亮，品質大概是不壞的。可是他們對付這像伙的辦法太妙了。他們時時在那裏旋轉那刻度器，老生唱了半句，就來了女聲的小調，小調沒有完一曲，又來了高亢的西洋喉嚨：：：他們到底想聽什麽，三四個月來我還不曾考察明白。也許，他們的趣味就在旋轉那刻度器吧。否則就在「有」具收音器丨收音器是時髦，人家都「有，」他們就非「有」不可。</p>
<p>又聽說上海有好多吸鴉片的人懶得出門，就利用收音機來互通聲氣。有幾個自設播音臺，在夜間一兩點鐘的時候，從鴉片楊上播音道：「張老三，吃過夜飯麽？李老四，明天晚上的馬將局有你在内，不要起得太遲了。」啊，現代文明的生活丨</p>
<p>說「收音機救國」（前天的報紙上登載着吳稚暉君「馬達救國」的談話，我這語式是有來歷的，）固然近乎荒誔不經。然而收音機這傢伙如果能好好利用他，譬如說，用來團結大衆的意志，傳授眞實的知識，報吿確切的消息：：：那末，從社會的觀點說，他的價値的確是了不得的。反過來，如果他僅成爲「街頭軍樂隊」的代替品，僅成爲商店與人家的點綴品，僅成爲吸鴉片的人的通信機，所傳送的又僅是「哭誰的爺」「哭誰的娘」之類，試問，社會上又何貴有這等「奇技淫巧」的玩意兒？</p>
<p>一切所謂「文明利器，」其價値都不存在於本身，而存在於對於社會的影響。這可以從兩方面看：一，他被操持在誰的手裏，二，他被怎樣地地利用着。就講馬達。像美國，總算馬達很不少的國度了，然而都會的大道上有大隊的飢民奏着飢餓進行曲。這就因爲所有的馬達操持在資本主義的手裏的緣故。假如那些馬達也有飢民的份，飢民就不復是飢民了。那時候，馬達的價値豈止可以「救國」而已？又如飛機。蘇聨近年利用他來散播種子，撲滅害蟲。這就擴大了人類戰勝天然的能力，飛機的價値何等高貴。但是，他被利用作轟炸機偵察機的時候，除了在軍縮會議中斤斤計較的野心家以外，誰還承認他的價値呢？</p>
<h3 id="c241">新婦女丨愛情的戲子 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 鑑泉</p>
<p>婦女最佳的品德：便是愛情與孩子。要有這兩件事，才能表現她們的眞實與偉大。然而現代的「社會之花」的新婦女，旣不足以言愛情，又不願意有孩子，憑著她們的想頭，以爲這是一個不幸和一個重累：眞的，她們只是些「怪物。」</p>
<p>她們雖不足以言愛情，却很愛言愛情；她們雖愛言愛情，却並不欲得一個男子的專一的愛情，也不想得一種情慾中的幸福；而只想博得在她們所籠絡之下的男子的讚嘆，恭敬，崇拜，和圍繞罷了。簡括的說，只需要一些温柔得如像一隻小貓的男子在她跟前做愛情的奴𨽻罷了。</p>
<p>當她們想取得某男子的愛情時，換句話說，便是想勾他來做愛情的奴𨽻時，她們也知道沒有辛苦就沒有成功；但及至成功了，也不過是把他安置在奴𨽻的隊伍中高一點或者低一點罷了。她們對於他的愛，正如主人愛一條忠實的狥一樣。</p>
<p>她們是不能專愛任何一個人的；因爲她們的情感是無定的，她們的靈魂是不安的，她們的心彷彿是個無底的黑洞，她們的趣味和了解都很欠缺：所以她們的智識知活都很黑暗。倘若我們枉自去誘惑她們，要想得到她們的心，靈魂，聰明，以及特别的品格，和另眼的看待，如古來婦人因爲一個男子的價値與熱忱而傾倒，那簡直是像被禁閉的人拿起拳頭想去打開鐵門一樣的不可能的事。　她們具有一種學理的巧妙，更懂得些人類普通心理學，尤其是男性的心理學。她們對於情人能照着他們的缺點，能隨着他們的品性來管理他們；同時又有些意想不到的親切，精微的當心，無限的柔情，來施與她愛情的俘虜。她們是直覺的，靈感的；他們常常拿一種貓兒似的精靈，從情人的眼裏看出那種温柔的乞兒似的哀吿，以及戰敗者的恐懼，和甘受征服的戰慄，無須他用嘴唇表白，她們便已完全懂得他是已經迷醉了。　她們的愛好裝飾，與其說是爲自己的愛好，毌寗說是爲要博得男子的愛好，她們更會裝出一種孩子的態度：因爲她們自己忖度在婦女中只有這樣，才更可以勾人，才更能博男人們靑眼的供奉。　好們的喜新厭舊，是很可驚的。在一個人身上，所有起初使她快樂的，使她起勁的，使她不安的，使她動情的，使她牽慮的，不久，便尋常了，鄙俗了，沒味了。</p>
<p>總之，今日這般社會花的新婦女，都是些戲子，愛情的戲子，複演一齣戲，只是照例做作：她們並沒有愛情。對於這等戲子，只好也扮一種脚色和她們一樣，去應付她們。誰迷戀她們，誰就沒生眼！</p>

<p>— 葉靈鳳</p>
<p>三伊莎貝娜</p>
<p>十年以來，顚倒在每個少年人所顚倒的夢中，歷盡了人世的悲觀離合，使我對於我的書籍起了加倍的珍惜和愛護，覺得在歡樂的時候，他能被冷淡了而不嫉妬，在我落寞的時候，他能不念已往而向我慰藉。</p>
<p>同時，祇有他們才清晰的知道，一個少年贍聖者在心的王國中所歷的行程，是怎樣的難辛而峻險。</p>
<p>因了這，我愛護着我的每一册書。因爲他是我最忠實的伴侶，可以爲我捨身的忠實的侶伴。</p>
<p>五年前，我收到過一封來信，蜷伏在家庭桎梏之下的琴向我訴說她的遭遇不仁的長兄剝削了她的一切自由，更要出賣她終身的幸福，她要求我最後一次的帮助。我知道她希望的是什麽，可是我不願輕易的施捨，於是我便使我無言的侶伴作了一次捨身的犧牲。</p>
<p>那是一册英國薄命詩人濟慈的詩集，我知道那裏面正包含了一個同樣的歡豔的故事，叙說一位名呌伊莎貝娜的姑娘，她的戀人怎樣遭了她不仁的哥哥的謀害，她得到了消息，怎樣偷到她戀人的頭顱，把他埋在一株羅勒花的盆内，放在自己的臥室裏，每天怎樣悄悄的用眼淚灌溉她永不枯竭的愛情。</p>
<p>我將這册書寄給了她，附着短短的兩句；</p>
<p>「珍重着，必要的時候，他會代替一個人的頭顱。」</p>
<p>不消說，我便永遠失去了這册書，一直到今天。可是我不婉惜，因爲我知道他早已完成了我所托負的使命。</p>

<h3 id="c243">童年的夢 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>這一次某雜誌爲新年號徵夢，將求夢帖，也寄給了我一張。到現在，我非但沒有把夢寄給他們，并且連做也沒有做；而求夢，帖上貼着的一分郵票，倒給我用去了。想想，眞是抱歉得狠的。</p>
<p>即使自己，也不能相信：以自己這樣的年齡，照理本該做夢做得最起勁的，但是事實上，做夢的時期却早已消失得不知道到那兒去了。只有那童年的夢，僅僅在我的記憶中留着糢糊的痕跡。</p>
<p>小時候，我做夢是做得狠甜蜜的。我最先志願做一個外交家，希望藉個人的才能從外交上使中國一躍而爲世界第一等强國。因爲照當時的想頭，國家的感望是完全由外交而來的。到後來，連自己也知道這種想頭的靠不住了，於是改願做一個兵工專家。在中學校的時代，我專門向這方面努力着。我的理化數學，在一級中是常考第一的。後來因爲家庭方央的關係，連這種想頭也沒有能實現；要講是恨事，也可以算是恨事的。</p>
<p>在個人生活方面，我的夢做得是更加精細了我曾夢想將來是一個富翁，有跑馬廳那樣大的一所住宅，有汽車，小火車，機器脚踏車，脚踏車，馬，有足球塲，藍球塲，游泳池之類的運動設備，每天起居以時，用洋號管理全家。自己永不娶妻，專和家人戲要。：：：：</p>
<p>消逝了，做夢的時期是消逝了，除了悲痛的回憶之外，它還給我什麽呢？以現在的事實而論，沒有一樣是和當時的夢想符合的，只有不娶妻一端，經過種種周折，現在倒是現實了。足以自慰的一點，難道就是這個嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c244">全世界的人口 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>『對不住了。』世光的空手又從他的洋服袋裏露出來了。</p>
<p>哈巴牧師的住宅正在敎會的後面。照面積說來，比敎會本身大三倍以上，是二樓建築的洋房，面前還有一所寬一畝多地的花園。</p>
<p>至哈巴牧師的門廊下，曹世光除了外套和毡帽，海泉也取下了帽並解了圍巾。一個門房接了過去，掛在衣架上了。海泉跟着世光一直走進哈巴牧師的客廳裏來。在這裏面已經來了不少的客了，有白的，有黃的，有男的，有女的。曹世光指着一位年約五十多歲的白人吿訴海泉。</p>
<p>『那就是哈巴牧師。』</p>
<p>世光說了後，走過去和那個老番點了點頭。</p>
<p>『哈巴先生，我介紹一位朋友給你，他也是個誠心慕道的人。：：：：』世光說着，拉着海泉的手介紹給哈巴。哈巴臉上忙堆起笑容，過來和海泉拉手。</p>
<p>『很好，很好。先生貴姓？』</p>
<p>世光忙替海泉回答了哈巴。</p>
<p>『我現在有點忙，密絲脫曹，你替我招待一下林先生。』</p>
<p>哈巴說着又拉了拉海泉的手，連說了兩句『對不住』後，又向那個白人說話去了。</p>
<p>『我們到禮堂裏去看盾吧。看那些艷貨來了沒有。』</p>
<p>看見哈巴那樣忙，那樣醒頭醒腦，沒有半點誠摰的樣子，海泉有點失望了。但是已經來了，只得跟着世光走到前面的大禮堂裏來。響過了四點，但是來了的信者仍然如晨星之寥寥，也不見有怎樣的靚貨。海泉便向世光提出了質問。　　『還早吧。她們還沒有來。』</p>
<p>但是海泉總覺得跟世光來，是錯了的。</p>
<p>『請你等等，讓我去問老哈，今天有什麽事情要辦的麽。如果沒有，等做過了祈禱會，我們出去頑頑好麽？』</p>
<p>海泉想，橫竪自己的時間是不値錢的，只點了點頭。</p>
<p>世光一去，許久都不轉來。海泉在中間的一排，佔了一個坐席，翻讀一本新約。但是每一個人從門外進來，他都很留心看，看了後又推測他們是怎樣的人物。果然如世光所說，到後來，也三三兩兩來了幾個有些委色的女性。每見着有給男性跟着走進來的，他便覺得那個女性異常的討厭，縱令她是個美人。　　鈴聲響了。從外面湧進一大羣的信者來了。最後，他才看見曹世光陪着一位四十多歲的，穿着一件很樸素的藍布棉袍的人，一面談說一面走進來。看世光對他的態度是十分的親暱而誠懇，那位老先生只是頻頻點着。</p>
<p>『所以照我的意思，非這樣辦不可。』</p>

<h3 id="c246">給未來的父母們 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 農者</p>
<p>現在的父母們的責任，固然是重大，但未來的父母們的責任却更重大；現在的父母們固然是要竭力的爲兒童謀幸福，但未來的父母們却更要預先計劃怎樣的造成未來優秀的兒童。</p>
<p>我們有發展性慾的本能，但同時也有保存種族的責任。可愛的兩性生活，固然是人生的權利，但竭力的敎養兒童，却是我們應盡的義務。所以我們要想度那甜密的兩性生活時，便當先向自己問一聲，『我們的敎養兒童的具體計劃，是否已經妥擬就緒？』</p>
<p>首要的問題，我們的體格怎樣，是否健全？原來人之髮膚，都是受之父母的。我們未來的兒童，乃是從我們身體中分化出來的。現在我們的身體强壯，我們未來的兒童也必康健，反過來說：我們的身體有缺陷，那我們未來的兒童也必不健全。請我們自己檢查，我們的體格怎樣，是否健全？其次，我們的經濟力怎樣，是否可以過得去？</p>
<p>在我們的了兒童的時候，預算表上的高度，已是非沒有的時候可比了。負着爲兒童謀幸福的責任，經濟的支出是難以預算的。假如事前沒有較豐裕的預備，使未來的兒童受罪，怎過得去？</p>
<p>關於敎養方面的。我們有無耐心，不分晝夜的盡力敎育兒童呢？在不如意的時候，我們會來藉着責打兒童而出氣嗎？我們要貪快樂而把兒童交給奶媽養育嗎？我們爲保住不給兒童以惡劣的暗示嗎？我們能爲兒童造成良好的環境嗎？我們能給兒童受適宜敎育的機會嗎？</p>
<p>未來的父母們喲！我們已經具備了上述的力量麽？等到我們有了這許多力量之後，便可以開始度那兩性生活而做人的父母。要是未具備呢？他根本便沒有做父母的資格，嚴厲的說一句，就是連結婚的資格也沒有，除非他們是預先服用了不生育的藥。</p>
<p>此外，如生理學，優生學，兒童心理學，：：：等，於我們未來的父母們，也是大有研究與實施的必要。</p>
<p>未來的父母們喲，請聽我的話吧！</p>
<p>如果我們將來不能好好的敎育兒童，倒還是不生的好，免得增加一般小乞丐，小賊骨頭，小强盜的數額。</p>
<p>要不生兒童，除非是不結婚，因爲結婚是必須生育的。</p>
<p>要不結婚，除非是不做人，因爲做人是有保存種族的責任。</p>
<p>未來的父母們喲！請不要以爲我的話是過激，且在這『現在』而未逹『未來』的時間中，多多的觀察，研究，和探討這父母之道吧！</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>時屆冬令，冬筍上市，一般講究吃的朋友，在這個冬季裏，少不了要吃吃冬筍。什麽「冬筍炒肉絲」啊，什麽，「冬筍炒菜心」啊，說不完冬筍的許多用途，總而方之，統而言之，凡是一樣佳餚裏，可用得着冬筍的，沒有不用冬筍就是了。</p>
<p>的確，冬筍這樣東西，也和其他的時鮮一樣可口，所以價錢也並不怎樣便宜。</p>
<p>但是，在南市的十六舖地方，却有一般小癟三，手裏拾了一紮紮的冬筍，每紮大約有五六隻之多，沿路向人兜售，索價只二角小洋，便宜固然便宜，誰知道，每隻剝開來，都是一包爛泥！好的還有蚶子和蛤蜊的壳，攙雜其間。自然，格外來得鮮了。</p>
<p>唉！不要說笑了，我想這種「爛泥冬筍」，如果買了來，是預備自家吃的，那倒不要去說他，譬如做了二角錢的好事，帮了一個小癟三的忙。如果買了來是預備送人情的，那纔眞是大大的笑話！而且，在送者，並不覺得裏面是一包爛泥。可是，在受者，却要疑心你有意和他尋開心了。</p>
<p>唉！總之，「爛泥冬筍」這個名詞，旣新穎，又奇特，想爲讀者諸羣所聞所未聞吧？做特揭而出之。</p>

<h3 id="c248">糖精之製法 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 行</p>
<p>糖精是一種有機化合物，其化學方</p>
<p>程式爲Ｃ６Ｈ４ＣＯＳＯ２ＮＨ至製造糖精之起點爲一烷困Ｔoluene其手續可分爲三步。</p>
<p>㈠硫酸置換（Ｓulphonation）先以一烷困與重量相等之濃硫混和。置重湯鍋上微温之，至此混合物之一滴，能完全溶於水中爲止：普通須時約三十分鐘。待其作用完成（即能溶化）後，置之待冷，緩緩傾入冷水中。所成之一烷困鄰位硫酸即溶化水中。其反應如下：</p>
<p>Ｃ６Ｈ６ＣＨ３＋Ｈ２ＳＯ４∈Ｃ６Ｈ４</p>
<p>ＣＨ３ＳＯ３Ｈ＋Ｈ２Ｏ</p>
<p>乃加炭酸　，（或炭酸鈣）而煑沸之。則過量之硫酸，變成硫酸鋇（或鈣）而沉澱，用過濾法除之。濾液中即一烷困硫酸鋇（或鈣）。徐徐加入淡硫酸，使該有機酸遊離，加至不再生白色沉澱爲止。而過濾。</p>
<p>㈡氱化　其濾液中含有一烷困鄰位硫酸，此時加以適量之過錳酸鉀，作爲養化劑。稍加温度，即得困酸鄰位硫酸。其反應如下：</p>
<p>Ｃ６Ｈ４ＣＨ３ＳＯ３Ｈ＋３o＝Ｃ６Ｈ４</p>
<p>ＣＯＳＣＯoＨＳＯ３Ｈ＋Ｈ２Ｏ</p>
<p>㈢硵精置換　此時即通，以硵精氣，或加硵精水。靜置數小時，即得。</p>
<p>ＮＨ３　Ｃ６Ｈ４ＣoＮＨ　２Ｈ２o</p>
<p>Ｓo３Ｈ　ＮＨ３　Ｃ６Ｈ４Ｓo２ＮＨ　２Ｈ２Ｏ</p>
<p>此物不易溶解於水，故通常用其鈵鹽。可將上得之溶液，加炭酸鈉，時常攪拌，以助炭酸氣之發散。遇濾後將其濾液蒸發濃縮之，待冷糖精即結晶而出。取集後，置乾燥器中烘乾之即得。</p>
<p>糖精之味，較普通之蔗糖尤甜四百倍。故稱爲糖精。一分糖精若溶於五萬倍之水中，其味猶甚甘甜，糖精之用途，固爲代糖，然因病理上不能用糖之故，始用糖精供給甜味。如患糖尿病，腎病等。而普通一般商人常貪利，用於糖食，餅糕中。此物無益於人體，不宜多食。</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>自貴報在大陸商塲創設流通圖書館以來，因定有送閱辦法，使我們可以終日的坐在店裏，亦得充份之惜閱機會。但書籍浩如烟海，敎我們許多略識之無的朋友們，借何書爲宜呢？一本書到手，如何讀法爲最適當呢？設或碰着疑難的地方，又向何人就敎呢？所以，貴報縱然設計周詳，而在我們，依舊有「望館興嘆」之感。</p>
<p>竊思我輩靑年，處此國難時期，亟應各自奮發，努力學術，以挽危局。雖勤勉者，頗不乏人：但散沙一盤，苦無相當團結。個有見聞，極其有限，獨自琢磨，則事倍而功半，梗塞難通之處，鮮能或免。同人等有鑒於此，爰集男女同志數人，擬利用星期餘暇，組織星期學術討論會，專以交換智識，互相砥勵爲宗旨。倘有贊成同人等意見者，盍興乎來！　張四維等上</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>這次貴報創關店員通信欄，專爲職業界的同人謀福利，深堪欽敬。　農等因爲業餘的娛樂問題，迄今還沒有解决，現在很想借貴刋一角地披露此項消息，以期職業界的同人，共來解决這個問題：如蒙贊同，那是很感謝先生的！</p>
<p>事實是這樣：我們一天到晚，整整的埋頭了十小時工作，完了以後，覺得精神非常困倦，於是想找一些娛樂來調劑生活；可是游戲塲，電影院，不是擾擾攘攘，便是睜不得眼。因想我國固有的平劇，在這多數人認爲高尙娛樂的時代，所以票房的組織，多如過江之鯽。但是踏進去一看，實在覺得太貴族化了，並且有些胡調性質的，使我們再也鼓不起勇氣來加入。爲了這個問題，所以我們想組織一個業餘平劇研究社。不過上述的情形，亟宜避免。社員方面，須以有正當職業的同志們爲限。我們人數也不須太多，費用要極端節省，純粹以謀業餘的正當娛樂爲主旨。凡有和我們表同情的朋友，我們一概歡迎加入，共</p>
<p>同負組織的責任，專此敬祝撰安。</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>自店員通訊欄發刋以來，我們一般店員，好像是在無限的黑暗裏面覻見了一線光明，而使我們在徘徊岐途中得到向前邁進的指南針。我們是多麽覺得欣喜和興奮啊！</p>
<p>現在我有一個組織「業餘國術團」的提議，請在貴欄披露，以供給大家討論。我們每天的工作時間，大概都要超過十小時以上，而且因爲缺乏運動的原故，以致面黃肌瘦，身體非常孱弱，所以無怪西人動輒譏笑我們是東亞病夫了。我們也很知道一切事業的經營，必須具有强健的體魄，和飽滿的精神，努力幹去，才有成功的希望：否則因爲身體的贏弱，精神就容易衰頽，做事也難免有因循苟且敷衍塞責的毛病了。因此　提但業餘運動，實爲急不容緩的一椿事。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>不過現在新式的動運設備價値昻貴　非我們所能購備，而時間地點兩項又太不經濟。所以我以爲國術是我們店員業餘運動的唯一方法。因爲練習的費用很少，隨時隨地，都可以練習，此較其他運動便利多了。而且練習國術是酌量自己的能力，按步就班的練去，沒有他種運動因用力過度而傷身體的弊病。根據上述的利益，我們實有組織業餘國術團提倡國術運動的必須，不過組織該團的辦法如何，還請先生指導並希望同情者通函討論，以臻美善。專上，並頌纂安周良驥上</p>

<p>編者按：上面的三封信，恰恰包括讀書·娛樂·運動·三大問題。這三個問題，對於一般親愛的店員們，可以說是最迫切的了丨現在旣由他們自動的一一提出來想從事組織，便是解决問題的捷徑。這不能說不是大好的現象。因爲他們已由不識不知進而爲對於一切感覺不滿，對於一切發生煩悶；到了現在，已知不滿和煩悶是徒然的，必須有了組織，則一切問題才有解决的希望，解决的辦法。編者在此不但很欣快的盼望這三種團體得以早日組織成功，此且有一些意見寫在下面給大家參考。</p>

<p>㈠我國許多團體，有一個最普遍的現象，就是在開始的時候都是勃勃有生氣的，那知到後來，時間愈久了，各團員的心情便漸漸的冷淡下去，往往會在不知不覺的中間，由停頓而無形解散了。這種毛病是在缺乏持久性。須知一個團體，歷史愈悠久則所發生的力量愈大，同時，社會一般人的信仰心亦愈堅；否則，像　光螢火一般的過去，還有什麽意義哩：</p>
<p>㈡一個團體的組織，必須牠中間所包含的各個團體都能健全，然後這個團體才能堅固。尤其是在初組織的時候，團員的吸收不宜太濫，因爲太濫了，在人數一方面說起來是很熱鬧的，但於會務的推進並無大益利，這是不可不注意的。我這裏的意思、也並不是希望有少數人主持某一種會務，而是希望每，種會必須有了相當的基礎，然後始可擴充。</p>
<p>㈢一個團員在團體裏面，應該創造性極大而佔有性極小。換句話說：就是義務心要大而權利慾要小，若反其道而行，則爭位置討便宜之不暇，尙何推進會務之可言呢？尙何改造生活之可言呢？</p>
<p>上述三點，因有鑒於一般團體所發生的弊端而　，我想諸羣站在同一的地位，爲謀自身問題的解决而團結，當不至於發生什麽毛病。以下特再將三項問題，分别言之，以抒管見。</p>
<p>（甲）關於組織星期學術討論會這個問題，與前天張建華羣所提出的讀書會，（詳十七日本欄）頗相接近。我想祗顧討論而不讀書，未免空虚；祗讀死書而不知討論，終屬徒勞。此二者，實有兼顧之必要，未可缺一也。若能於組織討論會之初，在會章裏面規定一種辦法：限制各會員於每周内必須閱讀書籍若干，（書名由主席指定，或自由認定均可。）到了星期日，大家就將自己書本上所遇着的困難或所發現的問題，提出作爲討論的對象。如此做去，不但興趣濃厚，且逼得大家每天非讀書不可。</p>
<p>（乙）平劇在我國的舊劇裏面確有相當的地位，所以能博得多數人的愛好；惟對之不感覺若何興趣者，亦屬大有人在。我想此輩朋友，不妨另外組織别的娛樂團體，如國樂會，口琴會和各種棋會等，用費有限，均屬輕而易舉的事體</p>
<p>（丙）現在有一些人，以爲今日科學</p>
<p>發達，槍砲的破壞力太大，所謂國術已成爲過去了的陳腐把戲，殊無再使人練習的價値。我以爲這也是一偏之見，將國術看得太重固然不對，但利用牠來鍜鍊身體，未嘗不是一個好法門；尤其是省錢，省時，省地方，對於一般店員的環境，更爲適合。</p>
<p>至於這三種團體的内部組織如何，我們不能代爲擬就，尙盼親愛的朋友們努力，藉便早日結合，從事討論。現在特將建議人的姓名，欲組織的團體名，通訊處，一併列在下面，希望贊同的朋友，逕行分别接洽，不勝翹盼！</p>

<h3 id="c251">「循環連看制度」 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 森</p>
<p>一位贊成廢除的「隨時入座，皆可看全」這就是說，你只消買一次票，可以老坐在戲院裏看上好幾塲的戲片。也就是可以「連看。」</p>
<p>這「循環連看制度，」到底是怎樣興起的？對於戲院以及觀衆，又有什麽樣的影響？這問題是否應該存在？作者要在這裏討論一下。</p>
<p>首先來說興起這「連看制度」的原故。簡單幾句話，大概是由於戲院生意不好，而該種戲院的觀衆又多不按時到院，所以戲院裏想出這樣的辦法。這辦法，對於多數人說沒有什麽異樣，可是少數人確因爲可以多看，有巧可取，就肯在不情願看片情形中而情願化錢買票入座了。</p>
<p>這制度施行後，院裏院外都起了不寗。對於觀衆說，一些在開映時間後入場的人，剛從外面亮地走進黑屋，一切看不到，像瞎子摸路，雖然有電棒照着路，終是不便當。這一來，妨碍了觀衆的視線之外，電棒的光也給與觀衆以耀眼的閃耀。</p>
<p>這問題，究竟應該存在，還是廢除呢。我想看到這裏的讀者，一定會同意的說：「要廢除。」</p>
<p>在這裏，我們須得先來問一問看影戲的旨趣。我們看影戲，總括說不出兩樣，一樣是消遣，一樣是鑒賞。可是，在這兩樣旨趣之下，人是要平心靜氣有定時的看才能行。談到鑒賞，更需要平靜狀態丨清靜的環境。但這些，在可以連看」的影戲院中，是無法解除的。</p>
<p>另外，連看可以發生極壞的影響，那就是人可以養成不守時間的惡習，並可以培植出紊亂的行動，甚且有好些無所事事的人，把好好的時間，全消耗在影戲院裏，這不是對於觀衆的一個很大的損失麽！</p>
<p>所以我們定要廢除這「循環連看」的制度！</p>
<p>編者按：循環連看制度在外國大都會中是極普遍的，并且已行了十多年了。在上海，似乎祗有兩三年的資格。這制度在通商大埠生活繁複的地方，尤其對於過路旅客們，是極受歡迎的，至少牠能適應一種特别的環境，所以要廢除牠，實在係一個「問題」不敏</p>

<p>閨秀出之名門，謂之千金；碧玉出于蓬門，則稱之野女郎ＷildＧirl今竟有蓬門而稱千金者，亦奇矣。</p>
<p>是片也，情節曲折，頗堪譽爲佳構，事述一村野女郎，才貌雙全，備受鄉人之崇愛，乃彼輩村夫，無愜女郎之意者，是時，適有一貴客到村，竟施暴行於女良；事雖未果，而女恨之切骨，聲言；有能殺該貴客者，以身許之，事先，有某少年，英俊超衆其妹亦曾受貴客之辱者，亦踪貴客而來終𨬽貴客以手槍。村中以命案重大，加緊兜捕，於是少年成擒；將行刑，少年竟乘機而逸，夜半，少年來探女郎，又被人追逐，後終得雙奔赴天涯云。</p>
<p>攝影光線之佳，非可筆喻，剪接新頴異常；自始至終，均以别致之格式，連續之，觀此一片，勝讀名著一册，導演亦稱技巧；前半部之旖旋；後半部之緊張；均與人以絕頂之美感，内景雖平凡，而外景則實有引人入勝處，漫然寫來，尤令人心癢，亟欲探其究竟，至最末一本，若斷若續者再，似完非完者三，非手腕敏活，曷克臻此？</p>
<p>法雷爾ＣharlesＥarrell之作風，與前大異，其沉着英武，肖似一天涯亡命，豪俠之客；面部表情，甚佳，此殆彼第一次與瓊ＪoanＢennett合演也，瓊玲瓏活　；初則浪漫無　；繼則一往深情，少年被擒，及其後夜半偶晤兩幕，神情入化；二人合作，相得益彰矣。有紅花綠葉之妙，偶有穿挿，則皆解人願，對白雖不尠，然决無使人厭惓之弊。</p>
<p>縱觀全片，均着目於劇情之緊凑，藝術之美化，故劇義，則無足談者，僅示：因果報應，及愛情之神聖而已，其中對於鄉村生活，竭力描寫，我輩城市中人，睹此大自然之景物，不禁生「反我烏有鄉」之感。</p>

<p>我昨天看見本刋上說「閻將軍苦茶一片中，服飾完全不對：：」我不禁起了很大的感想。</p>
<p>好萊塢是可以說沒有看見過什麽中國人的。導演或服裝員的人，也沒到過中國。所需要的材料只有到唐人街去找。</p>
<p>唐人街的中國人，多半是數世貿業於茲，一切風俗習慣，泥守舊於滿清時代的舊俗所以實在難得有近代中國的準確現實。</p>
<p>留學生呢？人是不少，一個個將對太平洋中，就西其服，革其履，整個兒的洋化了，那末美國影片公司，又那里找中國服裝的參考品呢？於是他們就假設中國平民是寬衣大袖，背拖髮辮假官的是繡補朝球，翖頂堂皇，。</p>

<p>十月裏工作裏的人漸漸向她表示不滿意了，他們派她做極容易的工作，他們要她走過一條街，立在街柱下，咳嗽着匍匐前走，但是她沒有一樣做得對的，她的背不再彎曲，她的眼習慣於强亮的光，不再會潮濕了，指導員把這幕連試了三次沒有成功，咒駡着令她回去。　　她下一次來穿着白色斗篷，綠色的裙子，更使他們發怒了，他們給她穿上人工做的汚穢而破舊的裝飾，不過她不再是眞的了，他們很嚴厲的盼咐她須一直穿着那套她初來時所穿的，她也完全不能了解他們。</p>
<p>十一月裏她沒有多少工作，十二月裏她在「被輕視的人們」的羣衆一幕裏表演，她不知道菲力潑所喊的「那婦人爲什麽不化裝起來？」她被拖進化裝室，把她在近幾個月來所失去的皺紋又深深地重印上她的臉。</p>
<p>「有什麽不對了？」當菲力潑走進辦事室看見一個醜陋而肥胖好像在勳怒而啼泣的婦人這樣的問。</p>
<p>「特立加而司基在怨着吾們好久沒有要她來工作了」柴培其吿訴他。</p>
<p>「吾不過說」她嗚咽着「那位先生太不公平，因爲吾現在能穿得稍爲完整些就不要吾了，據你們的意思，好像如吾這種一個工作的婦人連吃都不應該吃飽似的，吾一樣能扮像你們所要吾扮演的，不過，上帝呀，你們終不能永遠呌吾俄着肚子，穿穿破衣，况且影片裏面本來每樣都是假的，你們不應該爲了吾能吃了飽些就解吾職的呀：：：」</p>
<p>「並非如此」菲力潑發怒的說「你誤會了，在銀幕上吾們需要較表演更進一層，吾們需要生活，眞的生活，不過如其你自己要度着舒適的生活時對於吾們就沒有價値了。」</p>
<p>「是的」，柴培其佷有意思的說「他是對的，特立加而司基夫人，藝術是一個嚴厲的監督，你必須選擇，努力到死，勿避愁苦，終夜乳哺你的孩子丨丨然後吾們當再來請敎你，你懂得吾的意思嗎？」</p>
<p>不，她完全沒有懂他，她以爲這裏的人們都好像瘋極了似的，她倔强的背脊又有彎曲了，她迷惘地蹣跚而去。（完）</p>

<p>對鏡練習表情的好處就在自己能夠悉心觀察自己臉部各條筋肉的運動和情緒逐漸緊張或鬆弛的程序。對於别人用心觀察是大多數都能夠的。但是對自己用心觀察却只有極少數中的少數人了。只有聖人和哲學家才能夠觀察自己内心的變化。我們學習表演藝術的人能夠在這一方面實行體騐的功夫，其結果也是很足以驚人的。</p>
<p>普通人對於自己五官的形態往往是非常忽略的。一個人閉了眼睛默想出親友的形貌來。這是很容易的事。但是默想出自己的形貌來就很難了。許多人是永遠默想不出自己形貌來的。十個人同照一張像片。至少有八個人覺得自己照得不像；除了自己之外，人人都照得很像。這是甚麽緣故呢？這就是因爲大多數人對於自己形貌太不肯注意了。實在的，現在社會上的大多數人對自己是不認識的。他人只知道認識别人而永遠不知道認識自己。</p>
<p>學習銀幕的表演藝術的人最要緊的一種工作就是充分的和透澈的認識自己，除了眉毛和睫毛的數目無須數清之外，我們對於自己臉上的那一部分是凑成美的成分，和那一部分是凑成醜的成分，都要像會計師檢查當事人的資産一樣，纎毫無遺的檢查一遍。這是每一個愛自己的人必要做的一種工作，並不限於電影演員。</p>

<h3 id="e3">General Assembly Declaration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee passed the General Assembly Declaration at the sixth meeting on the morning of the 22nd. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>On December 15, the 21st year of the Republic of China, this Party held the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee in the capital. Since the opening of the meeting, with a spirit of harmony and mutual assistance, we have faced difficulties together. All that the people of the country have sought from this Party and what this Party should dedicate to the country has been planned with sincerity and put into practice with effort. Now, we summarize the main points of the resolutions and solemnly declare them. This Party bears the responsibility of national construction, the weight of security and danger. We have not forgotten the legacy of the Premier day and night. The calls of the people are increasingly urgent. The General Assembly hereby respectfully announces to the people of the country our shared determination:</p>
<p>(I) This Party's responsibility is to seek freedom and equality for China, to consolidate the integrity of national territory, sovereignty, and administration. If there is any infringement upon this, we swear to resist and restore it with all our strength together with the people of the country.</p>
<p>(II) This Party's responsibility is to concentrate the strength of the Chinese nation to guarantee world peace. For those who endanger world peace, we swear to lead the people of the country and work together with nations that respect faith and righteousness to quell it.</p>
<p>(III) This Party's responsibility is to realize constitutional government after the completion of political tutelage and to return political power to all the people. For all effective and correct paths, we swear to follow the Premier's instructions and the established rules of the Provisional Constitution to pursue it with all our strength. The General Assembly has this determination and deeply believes that only with the whole country united in heart and mind can we succeed. Therefore, we first follow the Premier's instructions and the norms of the Provisional Constitution to determine the outline of the National Political Consultative Conference and the timing of the drafting of the constitution and the convening of the National Assembly to show sincerity to the people of the country. However, given the vastness of China's land, the complexity of its people's sentiments, the disparity of its economic conditions, and the unevenness of its knowledge levels, the smooth implementation of this schedule depends on the people's vigorous rise, believing in the Premier's instructions and practicing self-governance, and cooperating sincerely with this Party. Only then can we complete the revolution and achieve the great cause of national construction. Once the outline has been established, the details will be considered even if they are omitted. Once the foundation is secure, the branches and leaves will grow naturally. Therefore, the resolutions regarding political systems, foreign policies, military facilities, people's production, educational policies, national unity, rectification of officialdom, and improvement of party affairs all converge on one path: to concentrate public opinion, cultivate strength, establish the national foundation, and jointly overcome national difficulties. The General Assembly deeply believes that the way to turn danger into safety must be sought in practice. Those who are responsible for vigorous implementation need not be told much. Those who understand reason and righteousness should not need much explanation from those responsible. To ensure vigorous implementation in the future, we must strictly review the past. The General Assembly hereby collects the important resolutions of the past five years and categorizes them into those that have been implemented, those that are being implemented, and those that are awaiting implementation due to various reasons, examining the reasons for their difficulty and the crux of the matter. We know that the promotion of various policies and the advancement of defense against insults depend on the prosperity of the people's livelihood and the stability of the local areas. Given the sincerity and simplicity of our national character and the abundance of our land, there should be promising prospects for reproduction and education. However, due to the rampages of the Red bandits, villages and towns have been reduced to ruins. The heartland is devastated, and the frontiers are not secure, resulting in the difficulty of simultaneously addressing internal pacification and external resistance. This Party has been anxious and worried about this more than anything else in the past year. The General Assembly was convened at a time when the suppression of the Red bandits had achieved victory, and the aftermath of the bandit areas has also begun. If we follow the established path and move forward without懈怠, we will surely be able to achieve the success of eliminating the remnants. Once the internal punishment is exterminated and the people's strength gradually increases, we can do something for the country. This is what the General Assembly deeply hopes that the people of the country will work together to complete. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Closing Ceremony <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session opened on the 15th and convened a total of six general meetings, one preparatory meeting, two group review meetings, and two meetings of the presidium, resolving more than fifty important cases. All committee members, both inside and outside the meeting, expressed a spirit of unity and harmony. All major plans for internal pacification, external resistance, and saving the country from danger have been established. The General Assembly was held at 11:00 AM on the 22nd, the closing ceremony was held. The Central Party Headquarters auditorium was slightly decorated, with lights illuminating it, solemn and quiet.

There was almost no space left in the auditorium. Central committee members who arrived later, except for Zhang Renjie, such as Liu Zhi, Cheng Tianfang, Chen Bulei, Fang Shengtou, and Luo Jialun, totaling more than ten people, were all standing. Lin Sen was originally sitting in the back row, but Chiang firmly requested Lin to change seats to the front row, and sat in the back row himself, being humble for a long time. All the central committee members also looked at each other and smiled, in a harmonious atmosphere. At 11:20, the meeting began with music, led by Chairman Ding Weifen. After performing the ceremony as required, Dai Chuanxian delivered the closing remarks. After the speech, Yu Youren read the General Assembly Declaration aloud, his voice clear, loud, and modulated.

<h3 id="e5">Dai Chuanxian Delivers Closing Remarks <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When the Third Plenary Session held its closing ceremony on the morning of the 22nd, Committee Member Dai Chuanxian delivered the closing remarks. The original text is as follows: Fellow comrades, today is the closing day of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee. Among all the plenary sessions, only this session has best demonstrated the spirit of unity of the entire Party and has best demonstrated the spirit of unity of the entire country. The responsibility of this Party is clearly expressed in the name of this Party, which is the Chinese Nationalist Party. The Three Principles of the People that we follow, the Premier has very clearly told us, the Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of national salvation, so the responsibility of our Party is to bear the responsibility of national salvation. Since the September 18th Incident last year, the country has reached a dangerous situation, with internal and external troubles coming at the same time. But the more we are in this difficult situation, the more solid the unity of this Party becomes. At the same time, the people of the country can also be keenly aware that only with one heart and one mind, and truly following the Premier's doctrine, can we rescue the country from the dangerous difficulties and complete the mission of this Party and the people of the country for the country. This spirit of unity has been fully demonstrated in the General Assembly, and can be as the Premier hoped for us, first, if we want to save the country, we must first restore our inherent spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. This moral spirit is the foundation of the Chinese people. In a very short period of time, the comrades in the General Assembly were able to unite and work together under this spirit, and we also saw that during the convening of this General Assembly, the people of the country, far away in Mongolia and Tibet, were all able to know and believe in the Premier's doctrine, and know that the Chinese Nationalist Party is of one heart and one mind to complete the task of national construction. From this point of view, it can be seen that the Premier's spirit has been completely infused into the hearts of the people of the country. Although the time spent in this General Assembly was short, and the cases resolved were less than any previous plenary session, the spirit of this General Assembly was more abundant and fulfilling than any previous plenary session. I believe that after the closing ceremony, all the comrades of the Party will be able to unite more closely to fulfill the responsibilities that the Chinese Nationalist Party should bear. The people of the country will surely believe in the Premier's doctrine, and under the leadership of this Party, work together with this Party to eliminate the national difficulties of China, to restore the rights that China has lost, and to complete the great cause of national construction. Today, at the closing of the General Assembly, I wish all the comrades of the Party and the people of the country good health, and work together to promote the completion of the cause of national salvation and construction.

<h3 id="e6">Excerpts from Talks by Various Central Committee Members <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Ji said that the spirit of the General Assembly is quite astonishing. All proposals focus on practicality and do not engage in empty rhetoric, setting a new record in the history of the Party. However, the key is to strive for implementation in the future. I will return to Ping in the next few days after the General Assembly. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren said that the results of the General Assembly are quite satisfactory in terms of both quality and quantity. Except for a few who are ill or tied to official duties, there are very few committee members who hold dissenting opinions and do not attend the General Assembly. This is enough to show that the national crisis is deepening day by day, and everyone has a thorough awakening. There is no phenomenon of mutual attack, suspicion, or infighting in the conference venue. This good sign is not only related to the country, but also of particular concern to the international community. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Kuoqing said that all proposals of the General Assembly avoid being empty. For example, regarding the case of completing the constitution in the 24th year of the Republic of China, originally fearing slackening in the middle, it was further stipulated that the autonomy of several counties should be completed in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and the actual intention to implement in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. However, the way to save the country should first correct the thinking of young people. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the closing of the plenary session, Wu Jingheng said that the impression of this General Assembly was excellent. Although there were debates in the conference venue, they were all based on the premise of national salvation, and there was no dispute of opinions. The result was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin said that although the main force of the Jiangxi bandits has been eliminated, the remnants have not yet been wiped out. Commander Chiang will go to supervise the suppression in person after the matter is completed in Beijing, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Fundamental Problems of Reforming Education <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee held its fourth meeting, focusing on problems such as determining educational standards, improving the education system, and improving higher education. Clear resolutions were made on all these issues. The content included: (1) National Education, (2) Production Education, (3) Teacher Education, and (4) Talent Education. Measures were listed and objectives were set. In the current situation where education is on the verge of complete bankruptcy, such clear resolutions on reforming education are truly enough to make those who worry day and night about "the foundation of the nation being shaken" happy. We are deeply gratified that there is hope for the rectification of education in our country in the future. However, we would still like to add a word of caution.</p>
<p>First, we believe that education is a department within the entire political system, and the quality of education is closely related to the entire political situation. Therefore, to rectify education, it is not only about reforming the education system and establishing educational objectives, etc., which are partial issues. The most important thing is the clarification of the entire political situation. This is a major premise that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Second, the number of illiterate people in our country today accounts for about 80% of the total population. The promotion of mass education is an urgent task. However, the reason why the number of illiterate people is so large is not because people do not want to receive education, but because they simply do not have the opportunity to receive education. Just looking at the current situation, there are years of famine, repeated wars, and the rural economy is increasingly bankrupt. People's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, the old and weak are displaced, and the young and strong are wandering. They have no means of survival, let alone education. Therefore, the implementation of compulsory education is urgent, but the stabilization of people's livelihoods is even more urgent. If people's livelihoods cannot be stabilized, even if compulsory education can be effectively promoted, it will ultimately be futile. This is also the meaning of "teaching them after they are rich."</p>
<p>Third, the backwardness of production in our country is an obvious fact. In the future, we should focus on production education to seek the development of industry, which is also a fundamental requirement. However, we believe that the root cause of the backwardness of production in our country is not that we have failed to emphasize production education. Just looking at the current situation, we have seen many scientific experts in machinery, mining, engineering, mathematics, etc., who cannot find a job, or even if they find a job, it is not related to what they have studied. On the other hand, those who have no skills or knowledge often find themselves comfortable everywhere. Based on this phenomenon, even if industrial education is implemented and various specialized talents are trained in turn, to assume that our production can therefore be developed, and that people can use what they have learned to contribute to the country, I am afraid that it is too optimistic. The biggest root cause of the backwardness of production in our country is the control and shackles of the capitalist economy.</p>
<p>Fourth, in recent years, student movements have occurred repeatedly, rising and falling in response to each other. Those who hear about it are appalled, and those who speak about it are heartbroken. They often say that students are arrogant and the academic atmosphere is corrupt, and that they should be strictly controlled and severely punished. However, we believe that there must be reasons for the occurrence of student movements, and there must be causes for the corruption of the academic atmosphere. Foreign aggression and internal turmoil are mutually debilitating, preventing students from studying with peace of mind, firstly. The current political situation cannot give students a good impression, secondly. Educational funding is often in a state of panic, thirdly. The bureaucratic system has invaded the education sector, fourthly. The agitation of new ideological trends, fifthly. Knowing these five causes, we can also know that today, if we want to stop student movements and rectify the academic atmosphere, simply starting with control and punishment is a superficial approach. Perhaps student movements will intensify with control, and the academic atmosphere will become more unrestrained with rectification. If the root is not corrected, there is no way to improve the branches.</p>
<p>Fifth, "Educational funding must be absolutely independent." In recent years, the authorities have repeatedly declared this. However, in reality, educational funding is still often in arrears, allowing schools to close, teachers to go hungry, and young people to lose their education. The entire education sector in the country is crying out for help, but there is no response. Huge military expenditures cannot be reduced, while educational funding is allowed to be in arrears for many years. If we talk about reforming education, this should be the biggest issue, and it is also a serious reality. The work of rectification should start with this as the first step. If this cannot be done, how many of the resolutions on rectification will not become empty talk?</p>
<p>All of the above, we believe, are deeply related to the fundamental and essential plan for reforming education today, and everything else is secondary. Therefore, after reading the resolutions on education of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, we have briefly stated our views.</p>

The people are suffering from the impact of the disaster, and their pain is indescribable. Their lives are unsustainable, let alone development. Therefore, the construction of the Northwest must take rescuing the people as a prerequisite. After the people's difficulties are slightly relieved, then we can plan to rectify education, transportation, water conservancy, and other matters to be effective. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Steel Plant Loan Still Under Careful Consideration <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the steel plant loan, some people in the government advocate caution to avoid criticism from the people after signing the contract. Moreover, German businessmen cannot relax the terms of repayment and national treasury guarantees. Therefore, the discussion has been delayed. The responsible personnel of the Ministry of Industry hope to complete it as soon as possible. However, the German businessmen (investors) require a report after drilling at the Leijiagou coal mine. If it is valuable for mining, they will agree to sign the contract. Now, the location of the plant has not been determined, and the Ministry of Finance has not fully agreed to issue national treasury bonds. And before the drilling of the Leijiagou coal mine is revealed, even if someone promotes signing a copy first, I am afraid it will not be possible. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 21st: Today, questions were raised in the House of Commons regarding the current status of British financial interests in Chinese railways. Under-Secretary Eden replied that the position of British bondholders of the Beining Railway line would not be affected by the independence of the three northeastern provinces. British employees formerly employed by the railway have reached a concrete solution after repeated negotiations with the Chinese government regarding their claims for salaries owed during their suspension. At the same time, negotiations have also been held regarding the overdue payment of principal and interest on Chinese railway bonds. The Chinese government has agreed that the Ministry of Railways will find a way to clear the debt, but a solution can only be reached after a practical method of collective treatment has been found. He has heard that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has a monthly allocation of funds for special debt repayment. In short, British Minister to China Sir Miles Lampson will continue to conduct the necessary negotiations with the Chinese government.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Belgrade, 21st: Relations between Yugoslavia and Italy are becoming increasingly tense, almost to the point of rupture. The matter arose from the Italian government's protest against the anti-Italian demonstrations in Cetinje and Belgrade, and the damage to two ancient stone lions on the border. Today, the Yugoslav Senate convened a meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely agitated. A resolution was passed, requesting the government to insist on protecting Yugoslavia's sovereignty and to reject any foreign aggression. The Foreign Minister did not respond to the Italian government's criticism, only saying that the letter was regrettable and without any basis, as Yugoslavia had never infringed upon Italy's interests or ideology. If Yugoslavia responded to Italy's criticism in the same manner, it would damage feelings. Now, we can only wait and see how things develop, but it must be stated that this is by no means the Yugoslav government wanting to draw swords and fight, nor is it advocating a policy of non-resistance. The Foreign Minister's speech was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the senators. It is expected that there will be continued anti-Italian demonstrations throughout Yugoslavia, especially in Dalmatia, which has been going on for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e73">New French Prime Minister Announces Policies; Fiscal Policy Follows Precedent <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 22nd: New Prime Minister Paul-Boncour read a declaration in the National Assembly today, praising former Prime Minister Herriot and his policies. Although the Herriot cabinet fell due to the vote on December 14, its policies have not been damaged. The organization of the current cabinet should be seen as an expression of willingness to inherit the policies of the previous cabinet. The current government's task is to navigate through a landscape filled with thorns. As for financial issues, the government intends to clean up finances, make up for losses, and rebuild a balanced budget. In order to achieve this goal, the government requires that all expenses be extremely tightened. All legal entities are willing to sacrifice for the country. In addition, the government also wants to find ways to reorganize public services and reduce redundant staff. Currently, it is necessary to immediately take measures to ensure that the next budget is balanced. The government is currently only requesting a one-month provisional budget (i.e., the provisional budget for January, because the current budget has not yet been passed by January). However, by January, the government may have to request a second month's provisional budget, which will include important parts of the austerity policy. Regarding the war debt issue, the government believes that in the current situation and the complex political situation in the United States, negotiations should be conducted with a very cautious attitude. The direction of these negotiations has been indicated by the vote in the Chamber of Deputies on December 14. Since December 14, Herriot and the Washington government have maintained their original relationship. The government now intends to promote negotiations to reach a comprehensive solution, so that the turmoil caused by the war debt burden on the economic recovery of various countries can come to an end. For this matter, we should cooperate with our allies, especially the United Kingdom. In addition, the government also intends to vigorously promote other international negotiations, because economic panic is not only due to economic reasons, but also due to psychological reasons. In particular, continued international unrest, mutual suspicion, and competition between nations are the main causes of economic panic.</p>

Except for the 165 die-hard prohibitionists, everyone's faces were filled with joy. Before the vote, the debate was extremely fierce. The prohibition faction exhausted all means to obstruct the bill, proposing amendments almost every few minutes, but the legalization faction strongly rejected them. In the end, the prohibition faction's amendments and obstruction reached a dead end, and the entire bill was put to a vote. As a result, 93 Republicans, 136 Democrats, and members of the Farmer-Labor Party voted in favor, while only 100 Republicans and 65 Democrats voted against. Before the final vote on the bill, someone moved to reduce the legal alcohol content of beer from 3.2% to 2.75%, which also failed, showing the sentiment of the majority of the American people towards legalization. The bill will now be moved to the Senate, but its fate in the Senate is questionable, as it is said that the Senate wants to use this bill as a tool to deal with the general sales tax. The general sales tax bill is destined to meet stubborn opposition in the Senate. If this bill fails, the beer legalization bill may also be rejected.</p>

<p>Japan to Hold Large-Scale Air Combat Exercises Next Spring</p>
<h3 id="e75">Over 400 Aircraft to Participate, Preparing to Disrupt World Peace <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: The Japanese Army Department feels that the air force is a powerful weapon for the future. In the incidents in Shanghai and the three northeastern provinces, if the Japanese army did not have air support, the casualties of the Japanese army would have been several times higher. In order to intensify research on large-scale air combat, the Japanese Army Department has decided to hold large-scale air combat exercises in Aichi and Gifu prefectures in March next spring. Seven air regiments, about 400 aircraft, and one anti-aircraft artillery unit will participate, practicing joint land-air offensive and defensive battles.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The Army Headquarters ordered the Army Aviation Headquarters to plan the first large-scale special air exercise since the founding of the Japanese air force in the eighth year of the Showa era. The final plan was decided today. The participating units are as follows: Kakamigahara Flying Regiments 1 and 2, Yokkaichi Flying Regiment 3, Tachiarai Flying Regiment 4, Tachikawa Flying Regiment 5, Hamamatsu Flying Regiment 7, Taiwan-Tung Flying Regiment 8, Tokorozawa Flying School, Shimodate Flying School, Akeno Flying School, Chiba Balloon Team, etc. Seven air regiments, three schools, and one balloon team from across the country will dispatch 400 elite aircraft, with Shizuoka, Gifu, and Aichi prefectures as the center, and Central Japan as the stage, dividing into red and white armies, and launching a great battle for Japanese airspace. The Commander-in-Chief will be General Watanabe Jōtarō, Army Councilor and Commander of the Army Aviation Headquarters. Such a large-scale air exercise is rare even in foreign countries. Since the Manchurian Incident, the importance of the air force has become increasingly apparent. In preparation for future wars, the operation and use of a large air force is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3 id="e78">National Alliance <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Formed Party Yesterday</p>
<p>Kenzō Adachi Elected President</p>
<p>Advocates Abolition of the Cabinet System and Establishment of a State Council</p>
<p>Advocates Dictatorship and Economic Control</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The National Alliance held a founding ceremony at the Hibiya Public Hall at 1:00 PM today. Thirty members of the Diet belonging to Adachi, and members of both Houses, Kuan and Ōtsuka, and 1,000 party members attended. First, Kuan Naohiko was publicly elected as chairman. Dietman Izu reported the process of forming the alliance, and then the platform and covenant were declared, which were unanimously approved by the entire body. Next, the entire body unanimously elected Kenzō Adachi as president. The new President Adachi climbed onto the wall amidst applause and clapping to give an inaugural speech and encourage party members. Also, the platform decided today is as follows: (1) Adhere to the spirit of national foundation and seek the reconstruction of internationalism; (2) Establish a controlled economy and seek the guarantee of people's livelihood; (3) Eliminate the accumulated abuses in the political world and seek the thoroughness of nationalism.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The main points of President Adachi's speech at today's founding ceremony of the National Alliance are as follows: The National Alliance is certainly inspired by the spirit of national foundation, opens up the difficult situation at home and abroad, re-establishes the foundation of an uncompromising and lasting peace, and emerges to build a society without exploitation. The National Alliance breaks away from free economic ism and takes a controlled economy as its banner, corrects the waste, chaos, and injustice of the existing economic society, so that individuals and groups can base themselves on their originality and activity to benefit the welfare of the people. The National Alliance seeks the redistribution and re-examination of national income, so that burdens are balanced and class opposition is adjusted. The biggest obstacles to improving finance and economic control are today's red tape and rules of the administrative organs. For a fundamental and major reform of the stagnation and inaction of administration, it is most important not only to break the accumulated abuses in the official world, but also to transcend the interests of party strategy. The National Alliance, in order to achieve political acumen, advocates the establishment of a State Council to abolish the cabinet system and should organize a strong political group.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: The main policies announced by the National Alliance are divided into political and economic sectors. Most noteworthy is that it advocates national politics, the abolition of the cabinet system, and the establishment of a State Council in politics, and promotes an Economic Staff Headquarters and implements a controlled economy in the economy. The content is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) "National Politics" The former cabinet system has not only become an organ for mutually seizing budgets, but has also completely become an administrative discussion forum. Therefore, in order to implement strong (i.e., dictatorial) politics, it is necessary to first abolish the cabinet system and replace it with a State Council, so that the boundary between administration and politics is clear and complete responsibility is given. The State Council is organized by seven state ministers, divided into domestic affairs, foreign affairs, and military affairs, to deliberate on national policies, so that the heads of each province can handle affairs according to law, and new responsible heads will be placed in each province. The state ministers may also concurrently serve as the heads of the ministries of finance, foreign affairs, and national defense, in order to eliminate the ills of dual government. The State Council will also set up a Bureau of Statistics, a Bureau of Investigation, and a Bureau of Intelligence. The Diet must establish a new standing committee, with one-fifth of the Diet members serving on it. All elections will be state-run, thoroughly eliminating crimes in elections. The Ministry of Justice must be completely separated from the State Council to ensure that it is an independent organ.</p>
<p>(B) "Establish an Economic Staff Headquarters and Implement a Controlled Economy" The controlled economy advocated by the National Alliance is based on the control of national public interest, opposes communism, and the scope of control should be determined by the situation. (1) "Outline of Control" (i) The main commercial enterprises and banks should be controlled; (ii) Manage exchange rates and trade, and maintain a certain price level; (iii) Establish a new land system, buy up land and resell it to farmers; (iv) The state manages rice and silk; (v) Formulate an agricultural insurance law; (vi) Control the economy of Japan and Manchuria; (2) Sort out the national debt; (3) Construct a new maritime transportation policy.</p>
<p>Japan United News, Tokyo, 21st: The National Alliance has decided on the following committee members: President Kenzō Adachi, advisors Kuan Naohiko, Ōtake Kanichi, and Satō Kei, Secretary-General Nakano Seigō, etc.</p>
<p>Nine people, Secretary-General of the Diet Yamamichi Jōichi, and five people including Koyama Tani-zō.</p>

<h3 id="e80">No Achievements Other Than Facilitating the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 21st: The "Geneva Daily" published an article on the Sino-Japanese Incident, titled "Mediation or Rupture?" It severely criticized the Committee of Nineteen and expressed deep dissatisfaction, stating: While the people in Geneva are playing games on the green table, incidents outside have been developing. Those who support the League of Nations have not been able to be satisfied with this situation. The only political achievement of the Committee of Nineteen recently was the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. This is the only item in which the League of Nations' mediation has been successful. In fact, diplomatic relations between China and Russia have been broken for several years, and their actual relationship is also quite bad. This time, the Committee of Nineteen formally declared that it would invite Soviet Russia to participate in the mediation. Japan had suggested to Soviet Russia that it conclude a kind of alliance that did not reveal the truth (referring to the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty). How could the Chinese not know this? The Chinese were deeply afraid that Soviet Russia's participation in the mediation would be detrimental to China, so they had to deal with Soviet Russia. Therefore, the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, which had no hope of success before, was suddenly realized. Is this not an achievement that the Committee of Nineteen can record? However, from now on, China will have no choice but to join hands with its greatest enemy.</p>

<p>"Regarding the explosions that occurred on or beside the tracks between 10:00 PM and 10:30 PM on September 18th, while there is no doubt that the tracks were damaged, in reality, this did not prevent the southbound train from Changchun from arriving on time. It cannot be used as a justification for military action. Therefore, the military actions taken by the Japanese army on that night, as described in the previous section, cannot be recognized as legitimate self-defense."</p>
<p>This point is extremely important. If the so-called explosion near Shenyang cannot be recognized as a legitimate reason for the Japanese military actions in various nearby locations, then the military actions taken by the Japanese army in other parts of China hundreds of miles away, such as Changchun, Jilin, and Yingkou, are even less justifiable. The Japanese army attacked Chinese military camps and set them on fire, while the Chinese army was under orders not to engage in conflict with the Japanese army. This point was also mentioned in the report. The Japanese authorities spared no effort in eliminating Chinese civil officials in the three northeastern provinces, and the report also paid close attention to this. After the resolution was passed by the Council of the League of Nations on September 30th, during the effective period of the resolution, Japan intensified its efforts to destroy the power of Chinese civil officials in the three northeastern provinces. Let us examine the content of the resolution. The second section states, "The Council considers the statement of the Japanese government that it has no territorial ambitions in the Eastern Provinces to be important." The third section states, "The Council takes note of the statement by the Japanese representative that the Japanese troops have begun to withdraw and that the Japanese government will continue to withdraw its troops to within the railway zone as quickly as possible, in proportion to the certainty of guarantees for the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people, and hopes to fully implement this desire as soon as possible." The fifth section states, "The Council takes note of the assurance by the Chinese and Japanese representatives that their respective governments will take all necessary steps to prevent the expansion of the incident or the aggravation of the situation." This resolution was accepted by Japan. However, what does the reality show us? The officials of the Liaoning Provincial Government of China, such as the acting chairman, the director of finance, the director of education, and the director of public security, were forced by the Japanese army to withdraw from Shenyang, the seat of the provincial government, and flee to Jinzhou, a city dozens of miles west of Shenyang. The report states that Japan did not allow the Chinese authorities to establish a provincial government in Jinzhou after fleeing Shenyang, and even attempted to destroy it. On October 8th, Japanese planes bombed Jiaotong University, the railway station, hospitals marked with the Red Cross, and other unarmed locations in Jinzhou, where the provincial government was located. When the Japanese planes flew low, they also strafed with machine guns. It is clear that Japan's intention was to completely eliminate the power of the Chinese authorities, which were indispensable for the organization of the government and the maintenance of law and order in southern Manchuria. After the power of the Chinese authorities in Jinzhou, Jilin, and other parts of Manchuria was eliminated one by one by the Japanese army, Japan then began to lament the lack of order in various parts of Manchuria. Japan's purpose was nothing more than to replace the Chinese authorities. This purpose,</p>
<p>China knows it, but Japan denies it. The League of Nations Council and General Assembly have already seen through their pretense. Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi stated in December 1931 that even if China offered Manchuria as a gift, Japan would never accept it. However, at the same time, neutral news agencies such as the United Press and Reuters continuously reported the fact that the Japanese authorities were making every effort, directly or indirectly through their puppets, to seize the governing power of Manchuria. The reason why I ask you to pay special attention to the bombing of Jinzhou on October 8, 1931, and the subsequent occupation of Jinzhou and other administrative centers in Manchuria is to point out the complete lack of sincerity of the Japanese authorities. On the one hand, they intermittently obstruct the peaceful resolution of the case, and on the other hand, they trample on the League of Nations Covenant and other legal principles. The result of Japan's contempt for the dignity of the League of Nations is the untold suffering inflicted on the Chinese people. I do not wish to describe it in detail, lest I add to the unease of those present. However, I can mention a few points for your consideration. Japan first guaranteed the League of Nations on September 30th and then again on December 10th that it would not take any further action to exacerbate the situation. The so-called any action naturally includes incendiary actions that lead to bloodshed. However, guarantees are guarantees, and actions are actions. In modern Chinese history, the attack on China's territorial and administrative sovereignty has been the most egregious during this Japanese atrocity. Japan's military actions have isolated 30 million Chinese people from their compatriots. Officials in the three northeastern provinces who were loyal to the government have all been removed and replaced by Japanese puppets. The customs and salt administration organs in the three northeastern provinces have all been forcibly occupied. Post offices, telegraph lines, mines, railways, radio stations, and tax collection agencies and tax revenues have all been seized. To this day, no administrative policy can be implemented in the three northeastern provinces without the permission of the Japanese side. All of this is a manifestation of Japan's violation of its solemn guarantees to the League of Nations and its continued terrorist and assimilation policies. Paragraph 127 of the Lytton Commission Report states,</p>
<p>"The Japanese army, without declaring war, forcibly occupied a large portion of land that undoubtedly belonged to China, separated it from China, and declared it independent. The facts are clear. The steps taken in this process are said by Japan to be in accordance with the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, but in fact, the meaning of these treaties is to prevent such actions."</p>
<p>Not only that, but on January 28, 1932, Japan continued to invade Chinese territory, attacking Shanghai, killing and injuring more than 24,000 Chinese people, and destroying property worth 150 million yuan in Shanghai and its surrounding areas, an unarmed city. The new Chinese army stationed in Shanghai came into contact with the Japanese army, and their resistance served as a notice to all parties concerned that the Chinese people can tolerate and adopt passive resistance to the extreme, but they can also be motivated and act with strong armed self-defense. However, even though the Japanese army encountered misfortune in Shanghai, it did not abandon its ambition. Its insistence on acting alone can be seen in its open recognition of the so-called "Manchukuo government." Japan recognized "Manchukuo" on September 14 of this year and signed a so-called protocol with the puppet organization, completely disregarding its obligations to the League of Nations Covenant and other international treaties, as well as its repeated promises to the Council. Regarding the situation in the three northeastern provinces and the recognition of "Manchukuo" by Japan, page 97 of the Investigation Team Report states,</p>
<p>"Therefore, the independence movement had never been heard of in Manchuria before September 1931. It is clear that this movement was only possible due to the presence of the Japanese army. Current or retired Japanese civil and military officials who are closely related to the new political movement in Japan described in Chapter 4 considered organizing and implementing this movement as a way to resolve the Manchurian situation after the September 18th Incident. These officials used the names and actions of certain Chinese people and used a small number of residents who were dissatisfied with the previous government to achieve the above-mentioned goal. The Japanese General Staff Headquarters, from the beginning or at least for a short period of time, clearly understood that this autonomy movement could be used. There is no doubt that the department provided assistance and guidance to the organizers of the independence movement. The Investigation Team is satisfied that, according to all the evidence obtained from all parties, although there are several driving forces behind the establishment of Manchukuo, the two most important are the presence of the Japanese army and the activities of Japanese civil and military officials. The combined effect of the two is the greatest. In our judgment, without these two, the new country could not have been established. Based on this reason, the current political system cannot be regarded as the product of a genuine and natural independence movement." (To be continued)</p>
<p>The Horrific Massacre by the Japanese Army in Fushun</p>
<h3 id="e90">American Reporter Mr. Hunter Personally Investigates <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Not a Single One of Three Thousand Villagers Survived</p>
<p>All the Affected Villages Turned to Ashes</p>
<p>An Impartial Report from a Third Party</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Took Retaliatory Measures</p>
<p>On September 16th, the massacre of nearly 3,000 of our compatriots in Fushun by the Japanese army was confirmed on November 30th by a telegram sent to New York by Mr. Edward Hunter, a correspondent for the American International News Service, because Mr. Hunter had personally visited the site of the Fushun massacre and conducted a thorough investigation. After learning of the massacre, our government protested to the Japanese government and reported it to the League of Nations, but the Japanese government denied it. Now, we translate the foreign account as follows to show the impartial report from a third party.</p>
<p>The massacre of three thousand people in Fushun, men, women, old and young, without exception, is a confirmed fact. I am now returning to that place, seeing its prosperity, which is due to the wealth obtained from the world's largest open-pit coal mine. After inspecting the surrounding area, I found that the houses there were all burned by the Japanese army, and the residents were gathered in one place by the Japanese army and massacred with machine guns, which was extremely miserable. Everything was witnessed by me and heard from the refugees, and the evidence is conclusive and undeniable. The remaining brick and mud walls of the affected villages, pointing to the sky, were blackened by the fire, like outstretched, tragic arms. The beams of the houses were all turned to ashes. The Chinese farmers, workers, and women and children who survived in the affected villages all described the event in the same way. After arriving at the place, the Japanese army treated the villagers like livestock, driving them into the pens where livestock were kept, and then taking them to a nearby hillside and massacring them. At the same time, they set fire to the villagers' homes with kerosene.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Why Did the Japanese Army Take This Action? <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Why did the Japanese army take this measure? The answer is the same: it was a retaliatory measure by the Japanese side against the villagers. In mid-September, the volunteer army that attacked Fushun had passed through the area. This attack caused the Japanese side to lose 350,000 yuan and kill several Japanese people. Therefore, retaliatory measures were taken against the villages here. However, even the Japanese side admitted that the volunteer army did not come from the villages massacred by the Japanese army this time, but from the Red Spear Society in Xinbin County, 40 miles east of Fushun, which was organized by simple-minded people. The weapons they used were red-tasseled spears. This is a secret organization formed by the people themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Blood Flowed Like Rivers, Turning the Ground Red <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>I stood on a steep hillside, which happened to be the center of the surrounding massacre of farmers, so I could see everything clearly. I only saw fragments of the farmers' clothes worn by the massacred farmers and women and children, stained with blood, scattered at the massacre site. Everywhere I looked, there were newly raised mounds, all new graves. What I smelled with my nose confirmed that the place was a massacre site. A farmer mustered the courage to follow me to the place, because there was a cottage a mile away from the massacre site, where a Japanese woman lived. There was a telephone in the house. If the Japanese woman saw someone at the massacre site, she would notify the Japanese military police in Fushun. Therefore, the villagers regarded it as a dangerous road. This cottage may be inhabited by dead souls, because it is the only one that has not been burned.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Villages in a Dangerous Area <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The first village in the affected villages is located within an 8-mile radius of the Fushun Station of the South Manchuria Railway, but it is extremely difficult to reach the village because it is a dangerous area. All foreign consulates have banned foreigners from going there. The Japanese and "Manchukuo" officials also intend to cut off its external transportation. At the end of the Fushun coal mine, there is a gate surrounded by barbed wire. This gate is opened during the day to allow Chinese miners to return to their nearby villages. The affected Qianjinpu Village is about several miles away. On the way to Qianjinpu, one must first wade across a semi-frozen river. The village is located on the right side of the road and can be seen at a glance. When I went to the place, the scenery of the village revealed a desolate and miserable scene. The villages in China are usually very noisy, but this place was silent, like a grave. There was not a single man, woman, or child. The ashes of the burned beams filled the wide space surrounded by the walls blackened by the fire. The tragic situation of all the houses was the same. I entered a certain affected house and walked on the broken tiles on the roof, the curved kerosene drums (which the people used as water buckets), and the broken kitchen god. The wells of each house also showed the same tragic situation, without a single survivor. A two-wheeled cart lost one wheel, and the other wheel was burned. The heavy stone mortar, which is a necessity for the family, was also destroyed and mixed with the burned wood. Along this dead village and the frozen river, only crows were miserably hidden in the chimneys. The above is the road I traveled.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Exchanging News of the Tragedy <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>As I advanced, pedestrians stopped and exchanged information about the Fushun massacre. Everyone had their own experiences. For example, Mr. Dong lost his two sisters, but fortunately his parents were safe. Although the total number of deaths and injuries was nearly 3,000, only 200 people died in his village, because it was closest to the city and received the news of the Japanese army's arrival earlier. Mr. Dong pointed to the four black walls and said that the owner of this house did not heed his advice to escape, and both husband and wife died. They fled with those who had difficulty escaping in the evening, and Japanese planes dropped bombs on their heads, but the damage was less than arson and machine guns. There were about 400 households in his village. The Japanese army was stationed in the surrounding mountains, so there was no way to escape. The villagers were all driven to the foot of the mountain by the Japanese army, unable to see their homes. Then the Japanese army set fire and burned the entire village, and all the villagers were killed.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Disciplined Destruction <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Looking around, I saw that the Japanese side carried out its cruel retaliation based on a precise training, the accuracy of which was like the train of the South Manchuria Railway. They were not bandits, because no family was spared, and no house in the area was spared. Even those hundreds of yards away, and whose destruction would require great effort, were not spared. Not a single roof was spared. All vehicles were broken or burned. Not even chickens and dogs were left. The situation was the same in a certain village slightly farther away from the village. This village was a prosperous brick kiln area. Now only the remaining bricks remain. The walls around the homes of the kiln owners and workers were sloping. When I entered these houses and met people, they would point me to the places where their friends and relatives died. "An old lady was crushed by the burning beams and could not escape, so she turned to ashes." "There was Aunt Shen, who did not want to leave, so she was burned to death on the stove." It is difficult to describe such terrible tragedies. The Fushun area was not limited to the above three villages. The Japanese army massacred nine villages. According to my investigation, the village of Datongjia, 10 miles south of Fushun, was also massacred by the Japanese army in the same way six days before the volunteer army attacked Fushun. All of this can be collectively called the Fushun massacre. My news was obtained from personal visits in dangerous environments and from conversations with affected villagers. About two weeks before the Fushun attack by the volunteer army, 14 Japanese soldiers ate in the village of Datongchow. When they left the village, they were suddenly attacked. Four people were killed and the rest escaped. The farmers said that it was not done by the villagers. Later, six Japanese cars came and stopped in the nearby Mengjiakou Village for a considerable period of time, burning three houses. According to the farmers, when they arrived in Datongzhou Village, 20 men, women, and children on the street were</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Killed by Japanese soldiers with bayonets and bullets. Japanese planes dropped bombs in the surrounding area and destroyed the houses in Mengjiakou Village. The next day, the Japanese army returned to Datongzhou Village and burned 100 houses in the village, burning more than 20 livestock to death. The above was told to me by a young man living in a nearby village, whose uncle was also one of the victims. His uncle's son escaped and recounted the incident. According to the villagers, about 6,000 Red Spear Society members and volunteer soldiers came from Xin , 40 miles away, to attack Fushun. They attacked in three routes. The middle route went to the south of Fushun, and the rest attacked from the sides on the left and right wings. Only the middle route entered Fushun. They attacked at 11:00 PM and the whole city was awakened from their dreams by the shouting. They fled at 3:00 AM. The Japanese army that came from Shenyang only had 600 people, so they did not dare to pursue, but they carried out organized retaliatory massacres on the villages through which the three routes of the volunteer army passed.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Machine Guns Used as Cameras <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The right wing of the Red Spear Society retreated south through Pingdingshan and Lizigou, Litsekow. There were 6,000 households in these two places. According to the refugees and residents of the area, the thousands of residents summoned by the Japanese army were gathered on a hillside. Mr. Dong said, "My village is eight miles away from there. When I heard the noise and ran outside, I saw a person named Fu running madly towards me, covered in blood, but fortunately not injured. His face was pale, and he told me in a hurried voice about the massacre he had narrowly escaped. First, Japanese soldiers came to his house and forced him to carry his old mother to the hillside. The Japanese soldiers then ordered everyone gathered there not to leave the hillside without permission, because they would search for the Red Spear Society. All the nearby areas that were considered to be part of the Red Spear Society had been killed, and their houses had all been burned. Then, the Japanese soldiers told them that they were going to take pictures, but there were no cameras at that time, no lenses, only machine guns and bullets. Mr. Fu said that his old mother was the first to be killed. When he fell, his mother's body pressed down on him. Suddenly, a Korean shouted, 'The Japanese have retreated, you can stand up.' He was fortunate enough to be unable to stand up at that time. All those who stood up were shot down by the second machine gun fire. All those who were kicked and moved, and children, were stabbed with guns. Mr. Fu was stained with his mother's blood, so he pretended to be dead and escaped. Because a unit of the volunteer army failed to enter Fushun and fled to these villages, the village suffered the most severe punishment. I have personally witnessed the three villages in the central part, Hailindun, Yangpaipu Yangpaipu, and Qianjinpu. Each village had 100 households. Before the Red Spear Society attacked, the Japanese army had built a defense line here. According to the farmers, the Japanese army used the fact that these three villages had failed to force the volunteer army to advance as a pretext for retaliation, and the Japanese army was divided into many small teams, each team dealing with a number of households. When I witnessed it, the retaliatory work had been completed. All the residents who were hiding in the houses had been burned to death. The three villages in the west, namely Andukiao Ertaokov Qianjiaotiaotze, or Hejiaotiaotze Huvkvchiatze, suffered less damage. Seven households were burned in Qian Village and three households in He Village. After the massacre, the Chinese police self-defense force and the volunteer army rebelled. According to reports for several weeks, after the cruel massacre, the Red Spear Society still attacked Fushun, but on a smaller scale, so although gunshots could be heard in the city, there were no losses.</p>
<p>Inspection Report on the Suppression of Communists and the Recovery of Various Areas (5)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Inspection of the Communist Bandit Stronghold of Honghu <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>A reporter accompanied the inspection group, arriving at Xindi from Jianli at 8:30 PM on the 13th. The following morning, they boarded an armored motorboat used for suppressing bandits in Honghu and went to inspect the bandit stronghold. They spent two days inspecting Honghu and returned to Xindi on the afternoon of the 15th. On the morning of the 16th, they left Xindi and returned to Hankou. The findings of the Honghu inspection are recorded below:</p>
<p>(The Situation of Honghu) Honghu was originally Wenxiang County. Due to vicissitudes and changes, the land submerged and became a lake, then was reassigned to Mianyang. The lake is 47 li long and approximately 39 li wide. The total area of the lake is estimated to be 1,064 square li. It is a vast expanse of water, seemingly endless. The surrounding area is crisscrossed by rivers, with numerous streams and tributaries, narrow roads, and dense reeds. The terrain is treacherous, no less than the Liangshan Marsh in the Song Dynasty. It is a place to harbor filth and hide criminals, a natural den of bandits. Even before the Communist bandits occupied the lake, bandits and thieves roamed there, causing trouble for the people. The government authorities ignored this issue and never suppressed them. The Communist bandits seized the opportunity to rise up and occupy it as their stronghold, eventually becoming a major threat.</p>
<p>(The Origin of the Communist Bandits) In 1927, Communist Party members Xu Xu, Lou Minxiu, Peng Guocai, Liu Xiafeng, and Li Gongyi from Mianyang and Jianli counties began to operate in the Honghu area. Under the guise of overthrowing local tyrants, they implemented terrorist tactics, secretly expanding their influence. After the purge of the Communist Party, most of them surrendered. However, a few members, including Lou Minxiu, hid along the lake shore and waited for an opportunity to act. Lou was a native of Mianyang city, as fair-skinned as a woman. He was gentle and refined in his youth, praised by the villagers. After joining the Communist Party, he completely changed his old ways and became a different person. In the winter of 1928, when the stationed troops were transferred, Lou went to Qujiawan, gathered Communist bandits from Jianli and Mianyang, and organized the Red Army, claiming to be the commander-in-chief. They had three or four guns and forty or fifty followers. On the eve of the lunar New Year, taking advantage of the fact that the military and civilians were busy celebrating the New Year, they went out to rob. They stealthily went to the Liuguan and Zhuhe areas and adopted the methods of Liangshan heroes, such as attacking homes, stealing camps, and seizing fortresses. They plundered police firearms and searched for civilian property. The military and police were unprepared and were often taken by surprise. They captured four or five hundred rifles, and their momentum gradually increased. They then stealthily went to the Jiangling area and repeated their tactics. By early February 1929, they had returned to Qujiawan with more than 1,000 rifles and more than 2,000 people. Duan Dechang was appointed as the fake military commander. Duan was a native of Huarong and had served as the director of the Political Department of the 8th Division of Tang Shengzhi's army. He was courageous, extremely cunning, and familiar with the Water Margin. Every time he plundered, he changed the established methods and applied them, often deceiving the local military and police. After Duan arrived in Qujiawan, he made some arrangements and launched a second attack, going to the Lizhou and Jinshi areas of Hunan. He joined forces with the bandit leader He Long and formed two armies. He was appointed as the fake commander-in-chief, Kuang Jixun was appointed as the fake commander of the Second Army, and Duan Dechang was appointed as the fake commander of the Sixth Army. He was a native of western Hunan, with a background as an outlaw. He was fierce and unparalleled. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the 40th Army. After the purge of the Communist Party, he became a bandit. Kuang Jixun was from Sichuan and a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy with military knowledge. In July 1929, He, Duan, Kuang and others led the bandit troops to Qujiawan and held a mass meeting. They established fake military and political organs in Qu. From then on, the Communist bandit forces in the central Hubei area began to grow, and they invaded and occupied Jianli, Fengkou, Xiantao, and Shishou. In November of that year, after being suppressed by the National Army, the bandits were defeated and scattered. The lost areas were completely recovered, and the National Army pursued them directly to Qujiawan. In December, the National Army returned to Mianyang for some reason, and the bandit forces revived. The recovered areas were again lost. The bandits then carried out massacres everywhere, and blood flowed into the ditches. From then on, their power became more and more rampant and gradually spread to the north bank of Xiang River, almost out of control.</p>
<p>(Organization of the Communist Bandits) The Communist bandits in the central Hubei area were meticulously organized. In terms of party and government, they had the "Hunan-Hubei-West Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China" and "County, District, and Township Committees," as well as the "Hunan-Hubei-West Soviet" and "County, District, and Township Soviets." In terms of military affairs, they organized a "Military Commission" to discuss major military plans. In addition to the Red Army, they also selected strong young men to organize the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers to be used by them. There were also organizations such as the Security Bureau, the Trade Union, the Farmers' Association, and the Women's Team. The Communist Party's fake Hunan-Hubei-West Provincial Committee had one secretary who had overall authority, Yang Zhishan. It had departments for publications, propaganda, organization, and women. The Propaganda Minister was Zong Panming, the Organization Minister was Yang Chenglin, and the Women's Minister was Zhang Xiaogui. The secretary was Sister Wang, and there was also a secretariat with various departments. The fake Hunan-Hubei-West Soviet had a presidium of nine people, consisting of Cui Qi, Ma Wu, He Long, Duan Dechang, Peng Zhiyu, Li Jiafen, Zhou Meitong, and others. Cui Qi was the chairman. It was divided into departments for internal affairs, economic finance, land, labor, justice, unemployment services, and others. The fake Military Commission consisted of He Long, Duan Dechang, Kuang Jixun, and others. The fake Provincial Committee, the Provincial Soviet, the Military Commission, the General Trade Union, the Farmers' Association, and other organs were all located in Qujiawan. The Mianyang County Soviet was located in Fengkou, and the Li-Jian County Soviet was located in Zhuhe. Other organs were established in the provinces, counties, districts, and townships, depending on the nature of the province and county. The organization was extremely complex and meticulous.</p>
<p>(Construction of the Bandit Stronghold) The Communist bandits in Honghu used Xindi as a port to secretly communicate and transport goods with the outside world. After several years of operation, the bandit stronghold had an armory and a mint for making guns and money. It had a very large radio station to communicate with the outside world. It established several hospitals that could accommodate thousands of wounded bandit soldiers and set up a Lenin School to carry out communist education. There was also a Lenin warship for naval warfare. The scale was grand and could not be compared with ordinary small bandits. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e98">A Record of Inspection in Yexian After the Robbery <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Broken wells, dilapidated walls, a pile of rubble</p>
<p>A century of essence destroyed in one battle</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: Since September 16, Han Fuju mobilized tens of thousands of troops to denounce Liu Zhentian. Liu's troops concentrated in Yexian, holding the city to resist. The Han army, considering the lives and property of the people in the city, did not actively attack, only surrounding it with heavy troops. The siege lasted for two months without resolution. Later, after the central government sent officials to Shandong to mediate, the Han army lifted the siege and withdrew west of the Wei River on November 12. Liu's army was also ordered to leave Shandong within a time limit and transferred to eastern Zhejiang. Liu's army in Yexian began to move on the 17th of last month, heading to Yantai in stages and boarding ships to go south. By the 9th of this month, the departure was completed. The provincial committee's county magistrate, public security chief, and others entered the city on the 10th to take over. In order to understand the state of local destruction and the situation after the robbery, the reporter took the time to go to Yexian on the 17th to inspect everything. Now, the findings of the inspection will be described below to inform the readers.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Order Restored on the Yantai-Weixian Road <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The reporter left Ji'nan on the 17th and stayed overnight in Weixian that night. On the Yantai-Weixian road, although it had suffered a major military event, it had never stopped traffic, except for the most tense days when the provincial army was advancing east. During the siege of Yexian, the Weixian-Shahe road was still open to military traffic. After the army retreated, the traffic area also gradually expanded, but it could not be opened to the Liu army's area because they would detain any vehicles they saw. When the reporter went to Yexian, traffic had reached Longkou. Now that Liu's army in Yantai has all boarded ships, it is planned to open the traffic directly to Yantai today or tomorrow. However, when the military operation started, all the vehicles in the eastern section were detained and used by Liu's army. There are only twelve vehicles left, and several are old and unusable. There are few cars and many passengers, so it is very crowded. But at this time when the military has just ended and people's hearts have not yet been stabilized, the road has been able to return to normal, which is very rare.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Roadbed Destroyed, Station Burned <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The reporter's car departed at 8:30 and arrived in Yexian at 12:00. The road was relatively smooth and there were no major problems. The Xinhe Changqiao Bridge, which had been burned, has not yet been repaired, and several charred trees still stand in the center of the river. When the car arrived in the area of ​​Wulihouzi and Shilipu, the trenches and ramparts built by the provincial army could be seen, winding through the fields and remaining intact. Because the car was traveling very fast, there was no opportunity to observe carefully. When the car arrived about a li away from Yexian, it could not move forward, because this section of the road, which was more than 900 meters long, circled the northwest corner of Yexian City in a semi-circular shape. At that time, Liu's army dug battle trenches on this section of the road. Now the road bureau is recruiting many workers to actively fill them in, but it has not been completely completed. The newly filled soil is very loose, and the car travels on it with great difficulty. Passengers must get out of the car and walk. The car station outside the North Gate of Yexian was located on the front line of the Liu army's first line of defense, and had been demolished and burned to ashes. Now the station is temporarily borrowing a surviving ancient temple as a temporary station in order to handle traffic affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Trenches and Ramparts Startling to the Eye <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After the reporter got off the car, he walked into the city and crossed the Liu army's trenches and ramparts outside the North Gate. This place was the main line of defense of the Liu army. The cross-section of this defensive line was also half a li wide. The barbed wire in the front row was still completely hanging on the posts. Behind it, several steps away, were caltrops, broken branches, and messy firewood, hindering passage. In front of the caltrops were landmines, bombs, electric mines, and other things. Although the Liu army had dug up a lot of them when they retreated, there were still many left. Until now, no one dared to go there. Behind the caltrops was the outer moat, which was both deep and wide, intended to prevent the enemy from trespassing. Behind the outer moat was the lying trench, which was deep enough to accommodate people. Soldiers would either lie or sit in it, holding guns to defend. Behind the lying trench was the communication trench, which was winding and twisting, passing through various places, for soldiers to advance and retreat and transport bullets and supplies. Further back was the covered trench, which was covered with wooden boards, tree branches, and other things, and covered with soil on top. Behind the covered trench was the shelter, which looked like a dungeon, either square or round, or in an irregular shape, all connected to the covered trench. It was for accommodation, rest, and storage of military supplies. Now most of them have been demolished, because the wooden boards and other materials used were mostly doors, windows, boxes, and cabinets from civilian homes, which have been taken away by the owners. This defense line was arranged in layers, which was very spectacular. It surrounded the city for dozens of li, and restoring this trench was a very large project.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Four Gates Decayed, A Pile of Rubble <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The destruction was most severe in the four gates, especially in the Huayuangou and Gelili streets of the East Gate. All the buildings were turned into rubble and ashes, with no complete rooms. The best ones had only four walls standing, but they were as rare as morning stars. According to the disaster victims, the reason why these places were so devastated was not because of artillery fire, but because the Liu army demolished the beams and pillars of each house in order to clear the line of sight and prevent the provincial army from using them for cover and stealthy advance, and then set them on fire, turning them into flat ground. In addition, the areas of Dongyingfang and Beiyao in the northeast corner of the city were also destroyed as described above. The South Gate and the North Gate were slightly less damaged, but they were also ten empty houses out of ten, with almost no four walls left. It was heard that the troops searched everywhere, leaving no place untouched. Fearing that the people would bury valuables, they dug everywhere, and no one was spared. Every household had no doors, looking like ruins and broken kilns. Until now, there was no smoke from cooking. Bricks and tiles were piled up everywhere, and the desolate situation was shocking. The walls of each house were connected to each other, like a main road. Those who returned from refuge only piled up bricks and tiles to temporarily serve as doors, and inserted branches and hung reeds to divide the courtyards. Those who did not clean up remained in their original state, allowing people to pay their respects.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Refugees Seek Lost Possessions with Tears <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>When the reporter entered the city, there were many sacks of earth and bricks piled up inside and outside the city gate. The situation at that time can be imagined. The destruction inside the city was very different from the four gates. The houses along the street were relatively intact, but the interiors were also empty, with only four walls left. The digging situation was the same as in the four gates. Now most of the residents have found their doors and installed them, making them look a little neater. Speculative merchants have brought scattered items from outside to set up stalls and sell them, so the intersection of the streets has gradually become lively. The doors, windows, wood, boxes, cabinets, and other items that were collected by the Liu army to build trenches and ramparts, now that the Liu army has retreated, if the people are allowed to dig them out automatically, it is feared that disputes will be unavoidable. Therefore, the street chiefs sent people to dig them out and concentrate them in one place, allowing people to sign for their original belongings. Therefore, at every street and alley, there were often piles of doors, windows, boxes, cabinets, and other items like mountains. Dozens of refugees wandered among them with tears and sobs, each looking for their lost items. The tragic and desolate scene was unbearable to witness.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Piles of Corpses Waiting to Be Buried <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>In this battle, according to the Public Security Bureau's investigation, thirty-six men and women civilians died directly from artillery fire in the city, and forty-three were injured. Forty-nine people died and five were injured in the four gates. A hasty investigation is unavoidable and may have left out information. The exact number should be more than this. In addition, there were about 700 people who died from shock, arson, and women who committed suicide after being raped. There were also hundreds of corpses left by the Liu army, all scattered and abandoned. Many were still exposed. Those who had been buried were also buried very shallowly and urgently needed to be buried deeply. Fortunately, it was winter. If it were summer, an epidemic would break out, which would be unimaginable. Now the Public Security Bureau is sending police to actively bury them in order to prevent snow and ice from making the work more difficult. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Delineation of Boundaries of Li Huang County <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>To establish special district</p>
<p>Under direct control of Headquarters</p>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: The Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, in view of the fact that Wei Lihuang's troops recovered the bandit's den of Jinjiazhai, in order to facilitate control, specially changed it to a county seat, and named the county Li Huang, to honor the achievements. As for the boundaries of the county, Zheng Yangwu was appointed, together with representatives from the governments of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, to conduct a survey and delineation. At the beginning of this month, Zheng, the Hubei representative Huang Houyan, the Anhui representative Liu Yunqing, the Henan representative, and the county magistrates of Huoshan, Liuan, Huoqiu, Shangcheng, Gushi, and other counties arrived in Jinjiazhai. After several days of meetings, they surveyed the map and decided to use the natural terrain of the mountains and rivers as the boundary. The areas to be carved out from Anhui province are seventeen Bao from Liuan county, namely Mabao Bao, Shibabao Shang Bao, Shibabao Xia Bao, Da Xiaoyu Shang Bao, Da Xiaoyu Xia Bao, Que Shang Bao, Que Xia Bao, Su Shang Bao, Su Xia Bao, Badahu Bao, Maoping Bao, Xindian Bao, Huaishuzhen Bao, Gubeichong Bao, Nanzhuangban Bao, Huangshihe Bao, Yufutan Bao, Tongtaoyuan Bao, Xiangshansi Bao, Caixialing Bao, Changshanchong Bao; Huoqiu County to cede three Bao, namely Baliwan Bao, Kaishunjie Bao, Baitajie Bao; The areas to be carved out from Henan province are two and a half Bao from Gushi county, namely Jinzhai Bao, Liqiao Bao, Changjianghe half Bao; Shangcheng County to cede fourteen and a half Bao, namely Foshang Bao, Fozhong Bao, Foxia Bao, Zhushang Bao, Zhuxia Bao, Xishang Bao, Xizhong Bao, Xixia Bao, Wangzhenzhai Bao, Shuanghe Bao, Qingshang Bao, Qingxia Bao, Mengshang Bao, Mengxia Bao, Xuan Shang half Bao, totaling forty-five Bao in the entire territory. As for the boundaries of Hubei province, because the Tongluoguan, Changlingguan, and Jieling mountain ranges bordering Anhui province are the main watersheds, the terrain is natural, and it was decided not to include them. The results of the survey were reported to the Headquarters for approval on the 20th. As to which province it should belong to, the opinions of the garrison commanders and county magistrates were also consulted, and it was considered appropriate to assign it to Anhui province. Zheng and others, however, believe that it is far from the provinces of Henan and Anhui, and political facilities may be beyond reach, and have suggested that it be designated as a special district directly under the Command Headquarters for bandit suppression.

<h3 id="e106">Xu and He's Remnant Bandits Fleeing Separately <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>He Chengjun will return to Hankou and immediately go to Shaanxi to supervise the suppression.</p>
<p>The remaining bandits in eastern and northern Hubei still need to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: Xu and He's remnant bandits, who had fled from Hubei to Shaanxi, were difficult to secure due to the blockade and suppression by the National Army, and then turned back and fled south. Xu's forces were recently in the areas south of Chenggu County, including Erlangba, Sunjiaping, Siduhe, and Zhongjiagou. He's bandits fled to the Bashan Mountains on the border of Shaanxi and Sichuan. The bandits were severely damaged and suffered heavy losses. They also attempted to break up into smaller units in order to preserve some of their strength. The separation of Xu and He from the union was also inevitable. The National Army decided to completely annihilate Xu's bandit forces first, as they had more followers. The troops entering Shaanxi included Liu Maoen, Hu Zongnan, and Xiao Zhichu's troops. Liu's troops are now moving from Baocheng to Xinjihuangguanling to prevent further westward escape. Hu's division crossed the river from Hanzhong and followed up to Dapanba Jingpoba. Xiao's division advanced from Tiexingba, Guankouzhen, Huoditang, and to Qinggeng Wuliba. Zhao and Wang's brigades of the Shaanxi army are also advancing towards Sunjiaping Songmeng'an. Earlier, when Xu's bandits fled west, they were as fast as the wind. Along the way, the weather was cold, so they plundered civilian clothes to keep warm. Because the National Army penetrated deep into Shaanxi, the transportation of military uniforms was delayed, and they did not want to take from the people, so they marched through the snow, enduring great hardship. Therefore, the bandits were able to drive straight in, and the chasing troops were further away from the bandit forces. It was not until the bandits fled south that they were able to intercept them. Recently, they have just completed the encirclement. However, the main force of the bandits still has several thousand men. Xu Xiangqian, Kuang Jixun, and others are all in the army. Although Liu, Hu, and Xiao's troops of the National Army are all elite troops, the strength of the Shaanxi army is weaker. Whether they can be wiped out in one fell swoop depends on the efforts of the armies. He Chengjun, who was ordered to enter Shaanxi to supervise the suppression, had previously gone to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session. On the 21st, he returned to Hankou from Beijing by plane. He will go to Shaanxi to supervise the troops within a few days, and set up a branch office in Xi'an. However, He's old illness has not been cured. According to him, he still needs to stay in Hankou for a few days to recuperate before he can go. It is expected that Yang Hucheng will first depart for the front to take command in person, while He will be stationed in Xi'an to preside over everything. As for the Xu and He's remnant bandits who are hiding in Hubei, the bandits have not been eliminated. In the Huangma area in eastern Hubei, scattered bandits appear from time to time, cutting off the roads. North of Huang'an, up to the border of Henan, there are even more scattered bandits. Therefore, the bandit area inspection team heard this and retreated. That place is a place where bandits such as Xu and Kuang have been operating for a long time. Most of the people have been communist-ized. When the army comes, they are good people. When the army leaves, they become bandits again. When there are many soldiers, they are as tame as sheep. When there are few soldiers, they rise up and seize weapons. Therefore, eliminating scattered bandits after the recovery of the bandit area is still an important issue. In northern Hubei, near Fang County, there is a remnant of He's bandits lurking. Recently, taking advantage of the withdrawal of the Sichuan army, they crossed the river and fled south, attempting to return to the old nest of Shihe. However, it is an organized group, and the guns are not necessarily sufficient, so suppression will be easier. In addition, Kong's bandits in southern Hubei have not been eradicated. That place has been assigned to the command of Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of the Xiang-E-Gan border area, for suppression. Zhu has recently ordered a general attack. Guo Rudong, the commander of the 26th Division, led his troops to Yangxin Town, 30 li away from Longgang. Zhang Gang, the commander of the security regiment, led his troops to Cikou to carry out suppression. Rong Jingfang, the commander of the 81st Division, was stationed near Jinniu Taipingtang to intercept them. Xie Bin, the commander of the 85th Division, was stationed in Tongshan, responsible for guerrilla warfare and responding to all sides. Kong's bandits were defeated in successive battles and have fled to the border area of ​​Xiang-Gan. (December 21)</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shandong Provincial Government Hastening to Handle the Aftermath in Jiaodong <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>First allocate 20,000 yuan to relieve the three counties of Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia</p>
<p>Li Shuchun will personally inspect the counties in Jiaodong</p>
<p>Dispatch from Jinan: In this Han-Liu war, the counties in Jiaodong suffered from the ravages of war, especially Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia. The disaster victims have no clothes or food, and many of their houses have been destroyed. They are sleeping in the ice and snow, crying from hunger and cold, which is very pitiful. The provincial government had long intended to find ways to provide relief, but because Liu's army had not been completely withdrawn, the situation was restrictive and they could not start. Yesterday, they received a telegram from Gao Lingbai, the commissioner monitoring the withdrawal of troops, from Yantai, saying that Liu's division could be withdrawn by the 22nd. The magistrate of Yexian County, Zhao Hongze, and the people of various counties have also sent telegrams, requesting relief. Today (the 20th), the provincial government's standing committee decided to first allocate 20,000 yuan from the provincial treasury and hand it over to Li Shuchun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to go to the three counties of Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia to provide relief as appropriate. The Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance will also properly draft fundraising and relief measures. Han Fuju will also donate three months' salary to provide relief to the disaster victims in Jiaodong. It is heard that Li Shuchun will depart from Ji'nan by armored train at 8:00 AM on the 22nd, arrive in Weixian on the same day, and transfer to a car to Changyi. The next day, he will go to Yexian to inspect and provide relief. After that, he will take the Yantai-Weixian line and go to Longkou, Huangxian, Penglai, Fushan, and Qixia counties to inspect. On the way back, he will go to Laiyang Pingdu again. If time permits, he will also go to Muping Rongcheng Wenjue three counties. But he must rush back before the Gregorian New Year. The departments and the secretariat will each send one person to accompany him. Chen Weixin, the director of the Yantai-Weixian Automobile Road Bureau, will also accompany Li Dong to inspect the road and plan for repairs (traffic between Weixian and Longkou has now returned to normal). The provincial government's standing committee's resolution on providing relief to the counties in Jiaodong is recorded below: "Proposal" The secretariat reports that Zhao Hongze, the magistrate of Yexian County, wrote a letter stating that during this military operation, Yexian was occupied by the military. The merchants in the four gates were looted, and although the city suffered less damage, most of them were also robbed. It is now estimated that there are more than 4,000 disaster victims. Fortunately, the Red Swastika Society is providing temporary relief to avoid freezing and starvation. However, the severe winter is long and spring plowing is hopeless. If there is no large amount of funds to inject into long-term relief, thousands of disaster victims will inevitably starve to death. The magistrate has witnessed the tragic situation and is very sad. I hereby report and request that relief funds be allocated and relief be provided as soon as possible to save the disaster victims, and so on. How should this be handled? Please make a public decision. "Resolution" First, allocate 20,000 yuan from the provincial treasury and hand it over to Committee Member Li Shuchun to go to the three counties of Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia to provide relief as appropriate. As for the fundraising method, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance will draft a detailed report and reply. (December 20)</p>

<p>Our county has previously proposed by the County District Party Department, to build the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument at the base of the Yuecheng in the West Gate. The residents of that place were willing to give up the land, to bring the construction to fruition. The Bureau of Construction drafted a plan and submitted it to the Department of Construction, which was approved by the provincial government. The Bureau was instructed to actively handle the matter. Then, the Department of Construction ordered the Memorial Monument to be moved to the Jade Emperor Pavilion, and the base of the Yuecheng in the West Gate to be reserved for public construction. The changes in government orders have caused confusion among the people. Now, various institutions have organized the Songjiang All Circles Construction Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument Committee, to work together and ensure its completion. Yesterday, a meeting was held at the County Party Department. Representatives from the County Government, the County Party Department, the Bureau of Finance, Public Security, Education, Construction, the District Office, the Property Office, and the County Chamber of Commerce attended. Party Committee Member Wang Zhe was elected as the chairman. After discussion, it was decided that the name of the committee would be the Songjiang All Circles Construction Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument Committee. It was decided that the central location of the Yuecheng in the West Gate would be the location for the construction of the monument. The committee will send a letter to the County Party Department and the County Government to report to the province for filing. The construction cost of the monument will be discussed again after the County Government replies to the meeting according to the previous agreed method. The committee will send a letter to the Bureau of Construction, requesting it to create a model of the monument and provide a cost estimate based on the revised red line drawings from the Department of Construction. The County Party Department will be publicly elected to preside over the committee and affairs, and the standing committee will be held twice a month.</p>

<p>Yang Xianyi's second daughter, Yang Lanying, who opened a smoking den in Sibaobao Bridge Alley outside the North Gate, previously demanded 200 silver dollars worth of opium from her younger brother but was refused. She then reported to the county court and had her father, Yang Xianyi, arrested and detained. It was discovered that Yang Lanying was also running an operation to sell opium and red pills. Her younger brother found out and was enraged, so he reported it to the County Public Security Bureau. Director Wu, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a detective team to the address. They apprehended Yang Lanying on the spot and seized two iron boxes. One box was full of opium, and the other was full of red pills. They were all taken to the bureau. Yesterday, they were presented to the county government for interrogation. Chief Wang opened the court for questioning. According to Yang Lanying's confession, the opium and red pills were bought by her late husband. Her husband was addicted to opium and red pills, and his addiction was severe. He passed away years ago. She also smokes because of her illness and begs the court to be lenient. Chief Wang reviewed the confession and, considering the seriousness of the case, ordered her detention pending escort to the provincial capital for further interrogation. At the same time, County Magistrate Chen submitted a document to the Civil Affairs Department for strict handling of Lu Fenglin and Li Zhengyang, the two principal offenders arrested by the Sixteenth Branch of the Anzhen Public Security Bureau in Yangjian Town for illegally manufacturing poison pills.</p>

He claimed to be named He Zhongyan, 23 years old, and worked at a pharmacy in Jiangyin. The porter booked him room number 27. Unexpectedly, after He booked the room, he secretly took red arsenic to commit suicide. The inn noticed and, fearing implication due to his death in the inn, gave him ten silver dollars and told him to leave. He then went to Tianbao Warehouse under Jixiang Bridge and booked room number 5. Yesterday morning, He's poisoning took effect, and he moaned softly. The warehouse was shocked and immediately ordered the porter to move him to the public area of the inn while notifying his younger brother, He Zhongxian. Around noon, he died. Later, He Zhongxian, along with the local leader Xi Zhiliang, reported the matter to the county court. Prosecutor Shen led officials to examine the body and confirmed that he had died from poisoning.

<p>Gu Yinglong, the principal of the Baipu District Public Elementary School, came to the city on the 20th to collect over 300 silver dollars in school funds from the Education Bureau. That evening, he boarded the Tongru Line No. 182 bus at the West Park Bus Station to return to Baipu. There were a total of eight people in the car, including the driver. When the car reached the Shibali River Estuary, Sun Ruhe, the squad leader of the Second Squad of the Twenty-Third Team of the Tax Police, and police officer Xu Jiaming stopped the car, intending to hitch a ride. The driver told them that the car was full. The tax police intended to open fire. The first bullet hit the tire, the second bullet pierced the car's roof, and the third bullet hit Gu Yinglong in the back of the head, killing him instantly. The tax police still drove the other passengers off with weapons, claiming to have killed salt smugglers and taking them to their department for investigation, forcing the driver to drive away. The crowd was indignant and immediately telegraphed the Baipu Station to intercept the police. The two officers were handed over to the county government. During the interrogation on the 21st, Sun Ruhe confessed to the shooting and killing, and was put in shackles and detained pending submission to the provincial government for review. The entire education community in the county was outraged by Gu Yinglong's tragic and untimely death, and the director of the Education Bureau, Guan Jincheng, went to the county government to request severe punishment for the murderers. The local automobile industry was also outraged by the tax police's brutality and lawlessness and went on strike. After County Magistrate Zhang's persuasion, they resumed operations on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>

Over 400 students marched to the homes of the school board members to petition, demanding the maintenance of the school.

<h3 id="e118">Volunteer Army Fights Heroically Against Japan, Hanyeping Company Sells Iron Sand <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Various Groups Greatly Agitated Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Discussed Countermeasures</p>
<p>Please Strictly Investigate Sheng Zecheng</p>
<p>Since the news broke that the Hanyeping Company was selling large quantities of iron sand, which is specifically used to manufacture military weapons, to the Japanese, all sectors of society have been shocked. Various groups in the city, considering the matter of great importance, convened a joint meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to stop it and subsequent measures. Representatives from the Dyeing Industry Association, Printing Industry Association, Calico Printing Association, Thermos Bottle Association, All-Suzhou Association, District Branches of the Citizens' Association, Commercial Associations, Diplomatic Association, and over forty other groups, totaling more than seventy people, attended. After much discussion, everyone agreed that iron sand is a critical raw material for manufacturing various military weapons. Hanyeping's actions are tantamount to handing over a weapon to kill our compatriots. Their madness has reached its peak. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese arsenals have been working day and night to manufacture instruments of death, and much of the raw materials they use are supplied by Hanyeping. This suicidal behavior is extremely painful. Currently, volunteer armies in various parts of Northeast China are fighting hard in the freezing snow, struggling to survive. People from all walks of life are raising funds to provide relief, but Sheng Zecheng, the general manager of Hanyeping, and others are taking the risk of doing something wrong, obeying the Japanese and supplying the enemy with military raw materials, which has a significant impact on the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast. This should be opposed and stopped unanimously. It was decided that: 1. A telegram should be sent to the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that they take urgent and effective measures as soon as possible, and that the method of reorganizing the China Merchants Bureau should be followed, nationalizing the company and thoroughly reorganizing it. 2. A telegram should be sent to all groups nationwide, urging them to pay attention and jointly advocate for this. 3. A letter should be sent to all industrial, commercial, academic, and national salvation groups in the city to oppose this unanimously and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. 4. The National Government should be requested to strictly investigate Sheng Zecheng, the general manager of Hanyeping. 5. Sheng Zecheng is insane and extremely sinful and should be given a serious warning. 6. Investigate the inside story of the Hanyeping Company and the collusion between Sheng Zecheng and the Japanese. 7. Expand publicity and alert the people of the country. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Guest Talk: Feng Zhanhai's Troops <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Arduous and Extraordinary, Loyal and Brave</p>
<p>Tragic Circumstances Bring Tears to One's Eyes</p>
<p>A gentleman from Beiping sent people out of the pass to comfort Feng Zhanhai's troops. Now, a telegram from the front reports that the soldiers of Feng Zhanhai's troops have been fighting bitterly with the enemy for years, traversing thousands of miles. When ammunition ran out and reinforcements were exhausted, they had no choice but to lead their troops west, hoping to replenish them in order to return east. On the day of crossing the river, the soldiers, unable to bring their families who had not been able to escape back inside the pass beforehand, and afraid that they would be humiliated by the enemy if abandoned, mostly used their hands to cut the throats of their beloved wives and children, and set out westward in tears. Passing through the wilderness of western Liaoning, at a time when nine out of ten houses were empty, they marched non-stop, unable to eat their fill for days. The northern border was cold early, and winter clothes had not arrived. They exchanged clothes for work. The troops were not tempted by profit and not afraid of powerful enemies. They faced death many times and experienced hardships unheard of in life. What were they doing? It was only because their ambition to save the country was not fulfilled and their patriotic heart was not dead. Looking back at the country, armed comrades who are not burdened with combat missions receive salaries every month and eat their fill every day. Feng's troops' situation is vastly different. The comfort funds received at home and abroad are like a drop in the bucket, less than two-tenths of each soldier's monthly salary. The dead cannot be mourned, and the wounded cannot be rescued, but Feng's troops are still disciplined, grateful, and without complaint. Every time they think of the enemy, they are filled with anger and determined to destroy them. Feng's army is worthy of the people of the country, but the people of the country are ashamed of Feng's army. These circumstances are all clear. There is no need to elaborate further. However, as the end of the year approaches, considering human nature, the wise men at home and abroad should jointly devise a complete and effective plan to comfort their past efforts and encourage their original aspirations. Recovering the territory truly depends on them. Feng's army's loyalty and righteousness are known to the world. Such tragic circumstances have not been widely understood before. When the people of the country hear this, how can they comfort these loyal and brave soldiers who have sacrificed for the country?</p>

<p>Please Reduce the Price of Domestic Goods to Expand Sales</p>
<p>Solicit Trademarks of Domestic Goods for Easy Identification</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: "Recently, a letter from Mr. Chen Heqing of the Tongtaichang Firm, a member of our association, stated that the sales of Japanese goods in the Siamese market have increased sharply recently, especially cotton yarn, and few people pay attention to domestic goods. It is found that this is due to the high prices of domestic goods. In order to recover our rights and promote domestic goods, Shanghai merchants should be informed to reduce prices to make it easier to compete for sales." Upon receiving this, it was found that the poor sales of domestic goods were due to the high prices. At the same time, it is difficult for overseas Chinese to distinguish between domestic and Japanese goods, and they inevitably buy them arbitrarily, which leads to an increase in sales of Japanese goods. Therefore, your association should inform the merchants to sell overseas goods, strive for low prices to make it easier to compete for sales, and also ask you to separately purchase a list of trademarks of domestic and Japanese goods and instruct overseas Chinese to facilitate identification. The association is paying attention to the promotion of domestic goods by overseas Chinese in Siam and sent the letter to the city's silk and satin, cotton flannel, flour, candle, straw hat, cosmetics, knitwear, woolen, motor silk velvet, soap, cigarette factory, rubber products, and parasol industries, urging them to find ways to reduce the selling price to facilitate competition. They are also collecting trademarks from the industry to bind into a book for forwarding and identification.</p>

<p>Adding More Sales Outlets Makes Buying More Convenient</p>
<p>The issuance of Wanguo Charity Race special prize lottery tickets to help the disaster area in northern Shanghai is being handled by various agencies, groups, banks, and companies in the city. It has been reported before that in the past few days, the number of buyers has been extremely enthusiastic, and each sales outlet has been crowded. For example, Yong'an Company, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, Guangdong Bank, Lihua Company, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and others have sold out their original number of tickets and have continued to receive more tickets, and the sales are very impressive. Now, Shenbao Newspaper, Xinwen Newspaper, Pudong Bank, Siming Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Franco-Chinese Savings Society, China Trust Company, Fuhe Public Company, and others are taking on sales to facilitate promotion and make buying more convenient. According to people familiar with the horse racing situation, the horse racing lottery tickets sold by the Jockey Club in the past were limited to members only, and it was difficult for people outside the club to buy them without repeated requests and commissions. However, all the tickets could be sold out. The issuance of these lottery tickets is not subject to the above restrictions, and everyone can buy them. In just a few days, a huge amount of tickets has been sold, and it is expected that the fixed number of 110,000 tickets will be sold out in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Large Quantities of White Rice Exported to Japan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Rice Prices Soar Accordingly</p>
<p>Food Panic Suddenly Arises</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency, this year's autumn harvest was abundant, and rice prices were low. White rice (commonly known as No. 2 rice) was only worth about seven silver dollars per stone, which was convenient for the common people. Unexpectedly, rice prices have suddenly risen to 8.2 silver dollars recently. The reporter specifically investigated the reasons for the price increase with rice merchants. It is said that Japan produces Indica rice, which the Japanese do not like to eat. Therefore, Japanese rice merchants often purchase white rice from our country to sell in the market. This year, rice prices in our country are low, so Japanese merchants have prepared funds to purchase and transport large quantities of rice, engaging in hoarding. This can both profit from it and promote famine in our country, which is a consistent policy of harming others and benefiting themselves. It is a pity that Shanghai merchants mostly only care about their immediate interests and sell rice to the Japanese, which has caused a sudden panic in the rice market, and rice prices have risen daily. It is heard that rice shops in this city, such as Changfengyi, Xiechangde, Taixiang, and Yusheng, have sold large quantities of No. 2 rice, which were resold to Japanese merchants by brokers and shipped abroad by Japanese ships.</p>

<h3 id="e127">General Ma Zhanshan Telegraphs the Bank of China to Waive the Withdrawal of the Heihe Office <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Maintain the Finance of the Anti-Japanese Base</p>
<p>Do Not Let the National Salvation Work Fall into Despair</p>
<p>The Heihe Government is Willing to Stick With the Office to the End</p>
<p>Please Immediately Withdraw the Order and Continue Business As Usual</p>
<p>The General Management Office of the Bank of China in the city recently suddenly withdrew the Heihe Office in Heilongjiang and transferred all personnel to the Harbin Branch. General Ma Zhanshan, chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, telegraphed the Management Office, requesting that it immediately withdraw the order, waive the withdrawal, and maintain the status quo. He hoped that the Bank of China, being patriotic, would not lag behind others and would be able to comply. The original telegram was extremely painful and critical. The Daily News Agency reporter recorded the original text from the United Northeast Armies' Shanghai Communications Office yesterday:</p>
<p>To Liu Piguang, Director of the United Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies' Shanghai Communications Office, transfer to the Management Office of the Bank of China in Shanghai, Please acknowledge the letter from the Heihe Office of your bank: "Our office received a telegram from the head office stating that Heihe has been without business for a long time, the customs have also been withdrawn, and there are no more taxes to collect. We are instructed to close the office and transfer all personnel to the Harbin branch to avoid losses. We will comply immediately and prepare to go to Harbin. Please check." We find that your bank's establishment, closing, and mergers of offices and branches are appropriate measures for your bank to coordinate business. We have no need to comment. However, Heihe's office is in a special situation, and it is the only financial institution for anti-Japanese resistance in the Northeast. All transfers of comfort funds and circulation of commercial funds rely on it. This is because most of the merchants along the border are foreigners. Whether they are purchasing goods or sending money home, they rely on remittance to turn things around. Since your bank stopped Heihe's remittance, it has already felt deeply inconvenient. Fortunately, the consolation funds could be used to circulate, and the lifeline of the local area could be maintained. This government, considering that the consolation funds are temporary and dare not hope for them to be long-term, intends to telegraph your office to restore remittance to maintain this anti-Japanese base. Suddenly, we received a new order to withdraw, cutting off this lifeline. The banks in our Chinese territory, which are being relied upon for circulation, are being moved to the Wei state, where they are being developed under enemy restrictions. The Japanese have been trying to say that we still have a financial end that has not been fully reached. However, we are blocking it ourselves, which is enough to please the enemy. This government is begging the office to withdraw the order. We believe that you are all Chinese and patriotic and will not please the enemy, but turn the national salvation workers into despair. This government has been conducting anti-Japanese resistance for seven months, and we have exhausted our strength, but we have not dared to be afraid of difficulties and retreat. Heaven has not abandoned China, and we still have this piece of clean land. We hope that the resident Heihe Office of your bank will stick with it to the end. If this government is unable to support it, we will protect your bank's personnel and escape through Russian territory, and we will not allow your bank to suffer any losses. We hope you will quickly telegraph the director and manager of the resident Heihe office to continue their work and not give up. In short, if we cannot restore ordinary remittance, we must at least maintain the status quo. Please be practical and seek profit for it. Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, Ma Zhanshan, respectfully.</p>

<p>Revising the Articles of Association for the Debt Consolidation Committee</p>
<p>Consulting the Municipal Government to Ban the Maintenance Association</p>
<p>Regarding the China Merchants Bureau's Board of Directors' request to establish a Debt Consolidation Committee and the recommendation of committee members, the Ministry of Transportation approved the filing yesterday. However, the Ministry believes that the committee's articles of association still require additions and deletions, and the Ministry has revised them, instructing the Board of Directors to comply. The New Voice News Agency's Beijing correspondent has obtained the revised articles of association as follows:</p>
<p>Articles of Association of the Debt Consolidation Committee: The Organizational Articles of Association of the China Merchants Bureau Debt Consolidation Committee. Article 1: The China Merchants Bureau Board of Directors, for the purpose of reorganizing pre-takeover debts, establishes a Debt Consolidation Committee, subordinate to the Board of Directors. Article 2: The powers of the Committee are as follows: (1) Matters concerning the investigation and registration of debts; (2) Matters concerning the review and reporting of debts; (3) Matters concerning the raising and repayment of debts; (4) Matters concerning the review of debt accounts; (5) Other matters related to the reorganization of debts. Article 3: The Committee consists of seven members, selected by resolution of the Board of Directors, four of whom are concurrently serving Board members elected by the Board. Article 4: The Committee members shall elect one member from among the concurrently serving members as the Chairman, who shall regularly attend meetings and preside over committee affairs. Article 5: The Committee shall meet once a week to discuss matters concerning debt reorganization. The Chairman shall report in detail on the progress of the reorganization at each meeting for review and discussion. Article 6: The Chairman shall preside over the Committee meetings. Decisions shall be made with the consent of more than half of all Committee members. If the votes are equal, the Chairman shall have the deciding vote.

Article 9: The Committee may, when it deems necessary, entrust accountants or lawyers to handle the matters stipulated in Article 1 of these Articles of Association, but must obtain the consent of the Board of Directors. Article 10: The Committee's resolutions shall be reported to the Board of Directors for approval and implementation. Article 11: The term of office of the Committee is set at three months, after which it shall be dissolved. Article 12: The Committee may formulate its own detailed rules of procedure, but shall report them to the Board of Directors for record. Article 13: The Committee's expenses shall be approved and allocated by the Board of Directors. Article 14: These Articles of Association shall be implemented after being approved by the Board of Directors and submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for approval.</p>
<p>Banning the Maintenance Association: The Ministry of Transportation believes that since the China Merchants Bureau was nationalized, public opinion has generally been optimistic, believing that the government can fully reorganize and develop it. Even the shareholders are satisfied with the government's method of buying shares at fifty taels per share, and most have actively withdrawn their shares. However, recently, a China Merchants Bureau Shareholder Rights Maintenance Association has opposed the nationalization of the China Merchants Bureau and the government's method of buying shares at fifty taels per share. They have even sent representatives to the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee to request the cancellation of the nationalization of the China Merchants Bureau. Recently, the Ministry has received requests from various groups in Shanghai to ban the Maintenance Association and severely punish those who initiated it. The Ministry has now consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government to strictly ban it.</p>

<p>Without Prior Notification to Our Government</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Received Telegrams from Various Parties</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the British government's sudden imposition of a new tax on the import of raw silver via the Yunnan-Burma Road has aroused opposition from overseas Chinese. The tax rate is seven and a half annas per ounce, and the import of Chinese currency has been banned, without prior notification to our government. This is in fact undermining Sino-British trade. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce has received letters and telegrams from various parties requesting that it forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to negotiate with the British side for the cancellation of the measure in order to strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. After learning the facts, the Federation will submit a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within days, lodging a serious protest with the British side.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of the Sino-French treaty on Vietnam, after several discussions between Foreign Minister Luo Wengan and the French Envoy, it has been largely decided. However, the tariff issue still needs to be closely studied with customs officials, so it has not been completely resolved. Currently, the French Envoy, Mr. Wilden, left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday morning. Therefore, the issue of the Sino-French Vietnam commercial treaty will have to wait until the French Envoy returns south in the spring to continue negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Summary of the Anhui Huai River Embankment Project <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Flood Relief Commission Inspects the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Huai River</p>
<p>The special train of the Embankment Inspection Team of the National Government Flood Relief Commission passed through Xuzhou at 3:30 p.m. on the 19th and turned south, arriving in Bengbu at 10:30 p.m. More than fifty local officials, executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, the Director of the Anhui Huai River Engineering Bureau, and engineers welcomed the team at the station. At 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, a welcome meeting was held at the Anhui Huai River Engineering Bureau, chaired by Director Wang Huzhen. Engineers Wang Xueshu of the 11th Bureau of the Public Works Relief Program and Zhang Chongji of the 13th Bureau reported on the work of the 12 districts of the Anhui Huai River project. Xi Dejiong and Wen Lanting responded. After the meeting, a photograph was taken. The team then went to the wharf and took a small boat to Huaiyuan to inspect the 12th district project, returning to Bengbu at 5:00 p.m. On the 21st, they went to the Wuhe area to inspect the 13th district project, then boarded the train at Linhuai Pass. The Preparatory Director of the Inspection Team, Li Zushen, and his wife had returned to Shanghai by express train at 2:00 a.m. on the 20th due to personal matters. The following is a summary of the engineering overview of the three districts of the Anhui Huai River project and the inspection situation:</p>
<p>(Disaster Situation) Northern Anhui is located in the upper reaches of the Huai River, with high terrain in the west and low terrain in the east. The Hong, Ying, Fei, Wo, Hui, and Tuo Rivers flow down from the northwest in parallel and converge on the Huai River. Every year in both seasons, floods occur due to poor drainage. In July of last year, the continuous rain caused the total amount of rainfall in one month to reach 490 kilometers, which was unprecedented. The water volume of each river increased sharply. The dikes on the south bank of the Huai River were originally incomplete and uneven. As a result, from late June to mid-July, from Huoqiu to Wuhe, the dikes collapsed section by section, flooding 38,000 square miles, causing 38 million yuan in property damage, and more than 40,000 deaths. The number of disaster victims dependent on relief reached 3.9 million. Although emergency relief was distributed by organizations such as the Emergency Relief Association and the J济生会 (Relief Society), it was difficult to reach everyone. Driven by the need to survive, many disaster victims resorted to desperate measures. Gunshots were heard every night in the Bin Huai area.</p>
<p>(Huai River Diversion Project) After the establishment of the Flood Relief Commission's Public Works Relief Office, in view of the tragic disaster in northern Anhui, which was caused by the lack of water conservancy, it was necessary to implement the Huai River Diversion project to permanently eliminate the disaster. However, the plan formulated by the Huai River Diversion Committee involved a huge project that could not be implemented quickly or completed in a short period of time. In order to take into account both providing relief to disaster victims and building water conservancy projects, the office selectively constructed and repaired the dikes that had collapsed in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River Diversion project, and built new dikes in areas along the Huai River where there were no dikes, surrounding low-lying areas and restoring a certain path for the Huai River. The surveying work was also carried out by the Huai River Diversion Committee, and many engineers were transferred to the project. In addition to building dikes, the office also dredged the North Fei River for 50 miles from Huoqiu to Hongze Lake. The Huai River Diversion project has been largely completed.</p>
<p>(Yin Suo Culvert) At 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, after the welcome meeting was held at the Anhui Huai River Engineering Bureau, the team went to the wharf and took a small boat to Huaiyuan County (23 miles from Bengbu). This place is the mouth of the Wo River into the Huai River. Its north dike is the first section of the 12th district. On the bank of the Huai River, culverts are installed at the mouths of small rivers flowing into the Huai River. Each culvert is named after an ancient person who made meritorious contributions to water management, such as Ximen Bao, Li Bing, Fu Jian, and Du Yu. The one inspected on this day was No. 27, named Yin Suo, which is 112 feet long, making it the longest of all culverts. The culvert is made of three-foot reinforced concrete pipes with three holes. The culvert mouth is equipped with automatic iron doors. When water flows from the inner river into the Huai River, the door opens. When the Huai River water backflows into the inner river, the culvert door closes automatically. The cost is more than 3,224 yuan. The structure of other culverts is the same. After the inspection, the team went to the Tang Huailou at Bai Ruquan, Jing Mountain, west of Huaiyuan County for lunch. After lunch, the team returned to Bengbu on the original boat. In the evening, the Anhui Huai River Engineering Bureau held a banquet. The special train left for Linhuai Pass that night.</p>
<p>(Huai Tuo Dike Project) At 8:30 a.m. on the 21st, the team went to Linhuai Pass wharf and took the Tailai small boat to Wuhe (northeast of Linhuai Pass) to inspect the 13th district project. At 1:30 p.m., the magistrate of Wuhe County, Song Zhinan, and representatives of various agencies and organizations welcomed the team on the shore. After a brief conversation, the team continued to drive to Wulifen to inspect the ten-mile dike project on the north bank of the Huai River in the first section of the district. The dike is four meters wide, which is wider than the original standard of three meters. However, the dike body is loose, and the tracks of ox carts are deeply embedded in two ruts, with dust and sand flying. According to the engineering personnel of the district, this is due to the local soil quality and there is nothing they can do about it. The inner slope is one to two, and an inner slope of one to five should be added to the lower half. Due to time constraints, it has not yet been built. At 3:30 p.m., the boat turned west. At 7:30 p.m., the boat arrived at Linhuai Pass. The special train traveled south at 11:00 p.m. and crossed the Yangtze River on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Group Inspection) The original schedule of the Dike Inspection Team was to inspect the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River, then continue to inspect the dike project of the Grand Canal and the dredging project of the Xiangxia River. The team was scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 24th. Later, because the inspection and reception along the way took longer than expected, engineers Zhu Shijun and Xue Zhaoshu went to inspect the 11th district project east and west of Zhengyangguan in the upper reaches of the Huai River. After completing the inspection, they transferred to the Xiangxia River. The remaining personnel inspected the Wuhe dike project and then transferred to Yangzhou and then to Gaoyou and Shaobo to inspect the dike project of the Grand Canal. The team is expected to return to Shanghai around the 24th or 25th. (New Voice News Agency)</p>

<p>More Than 800 Chinese Employees Have Resigned</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," it has been learned from reliable sources that the Chinese Postal Administration feels that there is a surplus of personnel after postal workers from the Northeast have entered the customs en masse. In addition, the economic decline has affected the postal service. Now, a special severance plan has been established to encourage long-serving elderly employees to resign voluntarily. To date, it is reported that more than 800 Chinese employees have taken the opportunity to resign. It is expected that more will continue to resign. Several foreign employees have received notices of the severance plan, inviting them to take advantage of this opportunity. As for the severance plan, even those who received special seniority bonuses in 1927 can still receive severance pay based on their years of service. For those who have served for 25 years or less, one month's salary will be given for each year of service. For years exceeding 25 years, half a month's salary will be given for each year. Those who wish to return to their home country will also be given first-class travel expenses and a generous allowance for the time spent on the journey. During this period, they will still be paid their full salary.</p>

<p>Will Return to Japan at Noon Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Japanese naval training fleet, "Yakumo" and "Pan-te," led by Vice Admiral Hyakutake, arrived in Shanghai from Lushun and Qingdao. Yesterday morning at 7:30, "Pan-te" was in the lead, followed by "Yakumo," sailing from Wusong into the Huangpu River, where they docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf. The Japanese Consul in Shanghai, Ishishe Tadashi, Rear Admiral, Counselor Yokotake, Secretary Horiuchi, Administrative Committee Chairman Yasui, Funatsu, and Yoneiri all went to the "Pan-te" at 10:00 to pay their respects to Hyakutake. Hyakutake told the representatives of the Japanese community that he had come to Shanghai on January 18 this year and did not expect the war in Shanghai to break out ten days later. He felt very emotional about this. This time, naval officer students came to visit the Shanghai battlefield, which showed the intensity of the war at that time. Chief Accountant Morihisa Kichiji said that the fleet left Japan on November 19 and first went to Manchuria, where they met with Puyi. However, because the weather was too cold there, they could not stay long. Now that they have come to Shanghai, they will return to Japan at noon on the 24th. They are scheduled to arrive at the Sasebo Naval Port on December 4. The long-distance training is scheduled to take place in late January, departing from Japan for Europe, traveling 18,000 nautical miles around Europe and the South Pacific Islands, and then returning to Japan.</p>

<p>A portion of the train service employees of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway did not have their seniority raises from 1932 approved, even though other departments had already announced them. Therefore, the entire organization, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Comrades Salary Arrears and Raises Delegation, repeatedly petitioned the Railway Bureau, but to no avail. After the new Director, Huang Boqiao, took office, the delegation held a meeting at Jiaxing Station the night before last, resolving to notify the authorities to provide a definite reply by 6:00 p.m. yesterday, otherwise they would be forced to strike and not be responsible for the consequences. The situation was extremely serious for a time. It is now learned that the case has been resolved. Yesterday, the authorities of the two railways received instructions from the Ministry of Railways to approve the payment of salary arrears and raises. The Railway Bureau immediately notified the trade unions of the two railways to inform the delegation. After learning the facts, the trade unions immediately sent an urgent telegram: "Urgent, Jiaxing Station to Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo to Comrades Salary Arrears and Raises Delegation Consulate, and to all station team members: The case of the raise of 17 in this city was telegraphed yesterday. The Ministry's order has been approved today and is now being processed by the Railway Bureau. It will be announced soon. Please inform all members not to be impatient. This association is willing to take full responsibility, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Trade Union Council". In addition, Councilors Min Luoheng and staff member Liu Junming were sent to Jiaxing yesterday afternoon to attend the delegation's 6:00 p.m. meeting to provide guidance and report.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Drawing Donations to Help Northeast Refugees <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Purchase a Chinese Typewriter</p>
<p>Can Donate 30 Yuan Method</p>
<p>The China Industrial Development Company, No. 9 Hankou Road in this city, in view of the fact that the three northeastern provinces have suffered from Japanese bandits, and the compatriots have been displaced, and the wailing of refugees is everywhere, and now that there is wind and snow, hunger and cold, the miserable situation is unbearable, the people in the rear cannot bear to wait for their death, so they took advantage of the Northeastern Refugee Relief Fair held in the New World to sell the company's patented national brand new Chinese typewriter, originally priced at 300 yuan, to customers at a 10% discount, and donate 30 yuan per unit to Northeast refugees, and deliver the money to the conference when it is sold, but the company deeply feels that the Northeastern Refugee Relief Fair has a limited time, and if the community needs to delay the purchase, it will not help, but the company remembers the refugees in the three provinces, not wanting to be behind, so it has devised a method, deeply hoping that all those who intend to buy a Chinese typewriter can pay a deposit of 30 yuan first, and the company will pay the money to the conference, so that the refugees in the three northeastern provinces will get more to eat and wear, and the customers will not lose anything, this kind of enthusiastic righteous act is worthy of admiration, I hope that all sectors will rise up quickly, if you have any questions or requests for samples, please contact Wang Jianxin, the sports group of the New World Fair.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Citizens Again Request the Public Works Department to Reconsider the Telephone Price Increase Case <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>He De Kui Accepts Suggestions</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Telephone Company announced the price increase, users have unanimously opposed it and have repeatedly appealed to various agencies. Yesterday, the Nanjing Road Chamber of Commerce and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association sent representatives Wang Lianfang.</p>
<h3 id="e140">A Municipal Hospital Will Be Built in the City Center <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Construction Costs Paid from the Reconstruction Public Bond</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the lack of a complete municipal hospital in the city, has repeatedly requested the municipal government to allocate funds to establish one as soon as possible, but because of the city's financial constraints, it has not been realized. It is now learned that the city's wartime reconstruction public bond has been issued, and the construction of a municipal hospital is also one of the uses of the bond. Therefore, Health Director Li Tingan has discussed the construction of a municipal hospital with the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and it is learned that the construction site of the municipal hospital is in the city center.</p>
<p>Ji Jiannan, Sun Wenyi, Shi Zongtang, and Si Ren carried letters and went to the Public Works Department to request the board of directors of the department to reconsider. They were received by Mr. He De Kui, the meeting organizer. After the representatives stated their intentions, Mr. He replied that he would submit the suggestions for reconsideration and then reply. The representatives then resigned. The letter to the Public Works Department is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, Although the news of the telephone price increase was disclosed in the Chinese newspapers in July, the measures were never announced in advance, and the company required users to retrospectively compensate for the new price, which has never happened before and is inconsistent with reason and law. Moreover, 'No Retroactivity' is a universally recognized legal principle. Our association sent another letter to your department on November 15, requesting that you accept the public opinion of the majority of citizens and re-set a fair new price, but the case has been delayed until now and has not been followed. If it is not resolved soon, it will inevitably lead to an unstable situation."</p>

<h3 id="e150">Five Provinces and Cities Interconnect Vehicles, Minhang Adds New Ferry <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Can Carry Ten Cars and One Hundred and Twenty People at a Time</p>
<p>Costing 80,000 Yuan, to Be Completed in April Next Year</p>
<p>Regarding the interconnection of automobiles in the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, the National Economic Commission and the five provinces and cities each sent a representative to form a Transportation Committee, and convened the first meeting in the capital on March 17. The representative of this city is Tan Boying, the chief of the Fourth Section of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Mr. Tan returned to Shanghai on the 19th. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency asked Mr. Tan about the details of the transportation meeting. The answer is as follows: My country's provinces are vast, transportation is inconvenient, and languages and customs are different, which can easily lead to misunderstandings and disputes. For example, Sichuan has had endless disputes over the years, which is clear evidence. In recent years, the central government has promoted and urged the construction of highways in the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, sparing no effort. Recently, it will be promoted to reach seven provinces, but after the roads are built, the management methods of the transportation vehicles must be unified to avoid the suffering of asking about customs when entering the country and to achieve mutual contact. This is the reason for the establishment of the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities. On the 17th of this month, the preparatory office of the National Economic Commission convened the first meeting of the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities in Beijing. The organization of the association is that the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai and the preparatory office of the National Economic Commission each send an expert as a member, and the representative of the preparatory office of the National Economic Commission is the standing committee member. A meeting is held in a different place every two months. Its important significance lies in: ㈠ Unifying the colors and styles of various transportation vehicle licenses,</p>
<p>㈡ Unifying the traffic signs along the way, ㈢ Unifying the traffic management methods and regulations, ㈣ Unifying the examination methods for drivers of various motor vehicles, ㈤ If a car driver causes an accident in his own province or city, the license will be revoked and other provinces and cities will be notified at the same time to avoid fraudulent receipt. The above sections are intended to increase traffic efficiency and reduce the pain of travel. In the future, the promotion of the whole country will have a great impact. The members sent by the provinces and cities this time have the same intention and cooperate sincerely. There are as many as 22 proposals, which were completely resolved within 10 hours. All resolutions are reasonable, so they can be effectively implemented and take effect very quickly. The Japanese criticized our country as an unorganized country, which can be defeated without attacking. As far as this city's position is concerned, it attaches great importance to the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, because Chinese and Western travelers travel frequently, and the relationship is very important. In addition to ensuring safety, convenience and speed must be taken into account, especially the reform of the Minhang ferry should not be delayed. The design of the ferry is undertaken by this city after being jointly recommended by the provinces and cities. Shanghai has the largest number of cars in the country. Every Saturday and Sunday, many people go to Hangzhou for sightseeing. The existing ferry can carry two cars at a time. If there are 100 cars, the last car will have to wait for two hours before crossing the river, which is very inconvenient for travelers. It is even more difficult to cope with the spring floods. Therefore, the bureau plans to run a large ferry at both ends, which can carry ten cars at a time and carry one hundred and twenty passengers at the same time. It can transport 150 cars per hour. The boat is 90 feet long and 23 feet wide. The diesel engine has 120 horsepower. Even heavy objects weighing 20 tons can be loaded on the deck. It takes only one and a half minutes to cross the river. The bureau has submitted the drawings and specifications of the ferry to the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities for approval, and construction will start soon. It may be completed in April next year. In the future, when it is completed, it will be the first and most modern car ferry in the East. The new ferry costs a total of 80,000 yuan. After the new ferry is completed, the existing Minhang ferry will be transferred to Dangtu County, Anhui Province, for use. The construction cost of the new ferry will be allocated by the National Economic Commission for more than 25,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan will be allocated from the surcharge for the interconnection of automobiles in the five provinces and cities. The remaining amount will be offset from the car ferry fund and handed over to the Jiangsu Construction Department for handling, and the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau is requested to assist in handling.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Institute of Forensic Medicine Examines Corpse and Discovers Cadaverine Morphine <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The First Discovery in China</p>
<p>The Institute of Forensic Medicine recently accepted a case from Zhenjiang and discovered cadaverine morphine in the corpse, thus redressing the injustice. At first, there were two men and women in Zhenjiang who were not formally married, and the woman was addicted to coal dust. Suddenly, the woman died, and the woman's family sued the man in court, saying that she had been abused and died from smoking. At first, the hospital examined and proved that she died of lung disease. Then, the forensic doctor in Zhenjiang re-examined and found a lot of morphine. The prosecutor transferred the case to the court. (The judge believed that there were many doubts in this case, and re-examined a piece of liver left over from the dissection and examination, only as big as a finger, and the skin and bones of the feet, and transferred them to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for further examination. The institute was accused of smoking, so it first examined opium acid, and after repeated examinations, it was not found. Then, it re-examined and found a lot of morphine in this small piece of liver, only as big as a finger. It tried to extract the morphine and inject it into a live rabbit, but there was no change. Only then did it recognize that it was cadaverine morphine, not plant morphine, because plant morphine must cause fainting and death when injected into a live rabbit. Cadaverine morphine is produced by the decay of animal corpses, and the discovery of cadaverine morphine is a new discovery.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Improving Film Censorship <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>In order to improve the film censorship method, the Shanghai Municipal Council previously appointed an investigation committee. The results of the investigation have been prepared and reported. The Municipal Council then issued the report to various departments for review and sent their opinions to the Security Committee for review. At the meeting of the committee on the 9th of this month, the chief of the police department stated that most of the criticisms of film censorship were criticisms of the nature of the film, not the standards of censorship. As for the investigation committee's proposal that the censorship committee should have the final decision-making power, according to the general manager, the Municipal Council has no right to grant this responsibility, so it is difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Since the investigation committee did not object to the current system, the police committee believed that there was no need for drastic reforms. In addition, it has never been difficult to recruit people to serve as volunteer censors, so it is difficult to agree to pay them. However, the proposal to set up a preview room seems feasible for the convenience of centralizing censorship work. Mr. Bolton also sent a letter stating that he is willing to provide equipment, but it is not known how much it is needed. He should be asked to explain everything in detail again, and whether the first branch of the Health Bureau can be converted into a projection hall is also waiting for the investigation report. In view of the above circumstances, the committee did not make specific recommendations on the report of the investigation committee, but expressed that any proposals that the chief of the police department believes can be implemented may be adopted. The minutes of the committee have been approved by the board of directors at the meeting on the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Marriage Dispute Between Yang Fansheng's Younger Sister and Chauffeur <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Chauffeur Sues Yang for Obstruction of Freedom</p>
<p>Yang Says Chauffeur Fabricated Accusations</p>
<p>Yang Fansheng, the owner of Bao Da Ginseng Shop at No. 75 Fengsheng Lane, Mulou Road, was sued by his former chauffeur, Li Gengfu, for obstruction of freedom. After being tried by Judge Fu of the First Special District Court, the defendant's lawyer requested that the case not be accepted because the date of the crime (February 28) stated in the plaintiff's accusation was before the promulgation of the amnesty decree. Judge Liu ordered that the case be investigated before the trial. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. First, Li Gengfu stated the intent of the lawsuit, stating that he was hired as a chauffeur by the defendant in December of the previous year. Yang Fazhen, the defendant's sixteen-year-old younger sister, always used me as a driver whenever she took a car. Over time, she gradually inquired about my family background. Because she knew that I was not married, Miss Yang said that she would be my matchmaker. From then on, she often went out with me and sent me love letters from time to time,</p>
<p>Willing to Marry Me as Wife I refused at first, saying that you have a mother and a brother, how can you be independent? Miss Yang said that if her mother did not agree, she would break away from the relationship. Now that marriage is free, how can her brother restrain her? She also gave me her photo, vowing to grow old together. I also told her that the difference between rich and poor is too great, and I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve my wish. Miss Yang then advised me to change my career and gave me funds to pay for social expenses. Later, I learned that the position of business director of the Zhaoshang Bureau's Tunan ship could be obtained. After discussing it with Miss Yang, she asked her mother and brother to give me a ten-thousand-yuan promissory note. The defendant also sent a letter to Yue Zhenbao, the owner of Taichang Wood Shop, asking him to recommend me. So I took the job on December 25th of last year. I never expected that the Japanese invaders suddenly invaded Shanghai shortly after taking over the job. The war had a great impact on the shipping industry. After the ceasefire, the Tunan ship was used for military service again, resulting in huge losses. The loans I borrowed from relatives and friends could not be repaid when they were due, and some</p>
<p>have been sued. After I became the comprador of the ship, I still lived in the defendant's house. On the night of February 28th of this year, two people suddenly came to the defendant's smoking room upstairs. After the defendant explained my name to the two people, one of them took out a gun and ordered me to return the letters and photos given by Miss Yang. I refused at first. The other person cursed and wanted to search my pockets. I dared not resist, so I handed over a photo and seven letters in my pocket and drawer to the two people to the defendant. After the two people left, I reasoned with the defendant. The defendant said that you want my sister, but it is impossible. At that time, the defendant's mother also arrived, saying that the Yang family had always been decent,</p>
<p>Urging Me Not to Disclose They still agreed to maintain my business, but now it is just lip service. Since the defendant has broken his promise, I have no way to deal with the debts I owe, so I have to sue, etc. When asked, the defendant Yang Fansheng testified that my family has always been very disciplined, and there is no such thing. The plaintiff is purely fabricating accusations. Otherwise, please order him to provide evidence. Since the plaintiff has no evidence now, I don't want to argue too much, etc. Judge Liu then asked Li about the incident on February</p>
<p>28th If there were any other witnesses, Li replied that Zhang Zugen and Yu Qingfeng knew about it. The two witnesses were summoned for questioning. According to Zhang, he used to be a tea servant in Yang's house and quit after the Dragon Boat Festival. Yu used to be Yang's chauffeur, but both said that they heard a quarrel upstairs and went upstairs to see, but the door was closed when they arrived at the door, so they did not know what was taken away, etc. After the lawyers on both sides argued, the court ordered the verdict to be announced on the afternoon of the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>High Court as in a Funny Play</p>
<h3 id="e154">Record of the Trial of Tan Ying's Appeal Case <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Tan Ying Paints Eyebrows and Applies Powder, Displays a Charming Demeanor</p>
<p>Tan's Mother Refuses the Original Verdict and Kneels Down, Weeping Loudly</p>
<p>Gu Baosen Secretly Remembers Tan's Words as Conclusive</p>
<p>Both Sides' Lawyers Engage in Fierce Arguments in Court</p>
<p>Tan Ying, a Shanghai Lianhua actress who also plays the role of a fallen woman, accused landlord Gu Baosen of rape. As a result of age issues, the Shanghai court ruled Gu not guilty. Gu then filed a countersuit in the original court accusing Tan Ying and her mother of false accusation. The court sentenced Tan Wangshi and Tan Ying to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve and dismissed the related civil suit. Dissatisfied, Tan Ying and her mother hired lawyers Weng Zhifan and Wang Jian to appeal to the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday (the 22nd) afternoon, a summons was issued to begin the trial. Respondent Gu Baosen also hired lawyers Liu Zhen, Wang Peiyuan, and Xu Qinfu as his representatives. When Tan Ying reported for duty, she wore a teal-colored fur-collared red-lined coat, a blue cloth cheongsam, beige socks, and flesh-colored embroidered shoes, with painted eyebrows and powdered face, displaying a charming demeanor. Her mother also wore a long, floor-length dress and a shawl. While in the waiting room, onlookers came and went, eager to catch a glimpse of the star's beauty. Tan Ying was not at all shy, chattering about her feelings. Gu Baosen, on the other hand, tried to avoid attention after arriving at the court. The case was heard by the First Criminal Division Judge Li Mian and Judge Lin Zhezhang, with Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo and Clerk Wu Daquan recording the proceedings. Due to the large number of cases, the trial was delayed until 4 p.m. and adjourned after 5 p.m. Tan Wangshi knelt down four times in court, crying and pleading. The lawyers for both sides clashed fiercely over speaking rights, turning the courtroom into a farcical scene. The court announced that a retrial would be held after further investigation. The detailed circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Ying's Age Question: Tan Wangshi (Question): Age, origin, address? (Answer): Tan Wangshi, 43 years old, from Jiangning, currently residing at No. 7 Runde Lane, Mietzhu Lane, Xiaonanmen, Shanghai. (Question): Husband? (Answer): Deceased for many years. (Question): Is Tan Ying your daughter? (Answer): Yes. Next, Tan Ying was questioned. (Question): Age? (Answer): Seventeen. (Question): Address? (Answer): Same as above. (Question): Birthday? (Answer): April 22nd. (Question): Lunar or solar calendar? (Answer): Lunar calendar. (Question): What is your zodiac sign? (Answer): Dragon. (Question): What school did you attend? (Answer): Many. I was in the fifth grade at Shengyu Elementary School when I was little. (Question): When did you start attending Minli Middle School? (Answer): I came from Junyi Middle School and then entered Minli Middle School. (Question): When was that? (Answer): I graduated from sixth grade. (Question): What year was that? (Answer): I attended many schools and often skipped grades, so I don't remember the year clearly. (Question): When did you enter Junyi Middle School? (Answer): It was the third year of junior high, half a year before entering Minli. (Question): What year? (Answer): I don't know, I only know the grade level. (Question): Was it in February of last year that you entered Minli? (Answer): No, I also studied at Shanghai Girls' High School for half a year last year. (Question): Was it the year you left Junyi Middle School? (Answer): I don't know the year, but it was about the year before last, the 19th year of the Republic (1930). (Question): The Minli school records say you are seventeen years old, the school records can't be wrong. (Answer): When I started school at the age of seven, my parents were superstitious and had my fortune told. The fortune teller said that being seven was an odd number, prone to illness, so it should be changed to an even number, so they falsely added one year, saying it would eliminate disasters. (Question): Minli Middle School has a letter proving you are seventeen years old. (Answer): That's because of the reason above, reporting one year older. (Question): Last February, you entered Minli from Junyi Middle School, the school records clearly state seventeen years old. (Answer): I am only seventeen years old this year. (Question): What evidence can you present? (Answer): The fortune teller can come out and testify.</p>
<p>Tan's Mother Kneels and Cries Loudly: (Question): In the first instance of this case, you were convicted of false accusation and sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve, and Gu Baosen was acquitted. What is the purpose of your appeal? (Answer): The purpose of the appeal is to request the revocation of the imprisonment. Next, Tan Wangshi was questioned. (Question): You are here to appeal, do you disagree with the charge of false accusation? (Answer): I disagree with the Shanghai court's judgment. My daughter is indeed seventeen years old. Because the fortune teller calculated her eight characters (astrological birth data), it was necessary to add one year to avoid headaches. The current judgment is based on seventeen years old. Now, the eight characters are in the mountain temple, placed in front of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. (At this time, Tan Wangshi knelt on the ground and cried loudly.) I implore the officials to revoke the imprisonment. (Seeing her mother in such a miserable state, Tan Ying also sat on the waiting chair and shed tears.) At this point, the judge ordered Tan Wangshi to look at the eight-character post that another person had arranged for Tan Ying to be a matchmaker. Tan Wangshi replied, "This eight character was arranged by Feng Mengyun, the owner of the Da Jing Daily, as a matchmaker last spring." (Question): These eight characters are for your daughter? (Answer): Yes. (Question): How can you tell? (Answer): They are for my daughter. (Question): Go to Guanqian, pay two cents, any fortune teller can write them. (Note: Guanqian is a place name in Suzhou, where there are many fortune tellers.) (Answer): We women don't lie. If we lie, we are willing to face legal action. Baosen raped my daughter and should be punished. Now, I have been sentenced to imprisonment, it's really too bitter.</p>
<p>The Course of the Seduction: (Question): Gu Baosen, you say he raped your daughter, there must be a basis for that. (Answer): If he wasn't intimate with my daughter, why would he be willing to issue a divorce agreement? He seduced my daughter for several nights, the neighbors know. (Question): When did the rape happen? (Answer): April 5th this year. (Question): Were you home? What were you doing? Why didn't you stop it? (Answer): He lived in number five, and I lived in number six, far apart. At that time, the Sino-Japanese War was happening, and people were fleeing everywhere. Gu Baosen took the opportunity to say to me, "Why don't your daughter come and live in my house?" I thought he had an old mother and a wife, I never thought such a thing would happen. (Question): Were you not taking care of things at home? Besides that, is there any other evidence? (Answer): Feng Mengyun of Da Jing Grain Store was the matchmaker, you can call him to testify. (Question): Now we just need to prove whether Tan Ying is seventeen years old. (Answer): The eight characters are in the mountain temple, which can prove that our countersuit is valid. I am willing to die in front of the judge. (Question): When you filed the lawsuit, what was your intention in suing Gu Baosen? (Answer): My daughter went out on May 27th and didn't come back all night. Although she was filming a movie at the company, every time she filmed a movie at night and didn't return home, someone from the company would notify us. On the night of April 5th, she didn't come back. When she returned the next day, I asked her where she went that night, she was shy and wouldn't say. After I repeatedly questioned her, she finally revealed the truth. I then negotiated with Gu, he first denied it, then wrote an agreement. (Question): What did you mean when you filed a complaint in court? Did you want Gu Baosen to be held responsible for raping a girl under the age of sixteen? At this time, lawyer Wang Jian stood up and said on behalf of the appellant that the appellant did not understand the law at all. This appeal is to request the revocation of the imprisonment and also implies that the other party should fulfill the agreement.</p>
<p>Tan Ying Asks to be Examined: Next, Tan Ying was questioned. (Question): When did you have a relationship with Gu Baosen? (Answer): April 5th. (Question): Where? (Answer): His house. (Question): Doesn't he live with his wife? (Answer): During the Sino-Japanese War, he sent his wife back to her parents' house. (Question): Did your mother know about this at the time? (Answer): She didn't know. She only knew that the landlord (referring to Gu Baosen) wanted me to go. (Question): Did the relationship happen during the day or at night? (Answer): At night. (Question): Your mother was at home, didn't she call for you? (Answer): Although we live together, we are far apart, so it is inconvenient to call. (Question): Are you a movie actress? (Answer): Yes. (Question): Is Tan Wangshi your biological mother? (Answer): Yes. (Question): What did you mean when you filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court on June 13th? What crime did you want to charge him with? (Answer): At that time, lawyer Zhang said that I was seventeen years old and could sue him. (Question): The school has a letter stating that you are not seventeen years old. (Answer): I have already explained the origin of adding one year. (Question): What is the proof? (Answer): The fortune teller Diao Ao Ke can prove it. (Question): Have you had a relationship with anyone else? (Answer): Absolutely not, only Gu Baosen. Please let the court examine me. Next, Tan Wangshi was questioned again, and Tan Wangshi knelt down and cried loudly again, calling out "Officials." Seeing her mother crying repeatedly, Tan Ying also lowered her head and shed tears, looking utterly miserable. (Question): Do you disagree with the Shanghai court's rejection of the civil suit? (Answer): My little girl's life has been wasted, I only ask the officials for a fair judgment. The part of the false accusation should be revoked.</p>
<p>Gu Baosen's Testimony: Next, Gu Baosen was questioned. (Question): Age, origin, address? (Answer): Twenty-four years old, from Shanghai, residing on Sanma Road, occupation: construction engineer. (Question): Tan Ying accused you of adultery, the Shanghai court acquitted you and sentenced Tan Wangshi and Tan Ying to two months' imprisonment for false accusation. When did you commit adultery with Tan Ying? (Answer): That's not true. After I divorced my wife, Tan Wangshi often came to my house. She said that the child had no one to take care of and wanted to introduce me to her. She repeatedly asked for my opinion. (Question): Tan Ying had a relationship with you on April 5th, at your house. (Answer): Tan Wangshi moved in on January 5th, paying 40 yuan in rent per month. By April, she had owed four months' rent. On April 4th, I took Tan Wangshi and her daughter to the police station. How could adultery have happened on April 5th? (Question): Did you come back from the police station that day? (Answer): Yes, I came back. (Question): If you came back, it's certainly possible. (Question): What do you mean by hiring a lawyer today? Gu's defense lawyer Liu Zhen stood up and said that because the summons did not state anything, it was considered a countersuit.</p>
<p>Gu Has a Secret Mark on His Body: Next, Tan Ying was questioned again. (Question): The reason stated in the complaint mentions a secret mark on Gu Baosen's body, where is it? (Answer): There are many people listening, it is inconvenient to say. (Question): How can the secret mark prove adultery? (Answer): I am a virgin. If I didn't have a relationship, how would I know his secret mark? At this time, the judge showed photos of Tan Ying and Han Jiliang together and a letter from Wu Zihao. Tan Ying replied that Han was a male student at Minli Middle School. She knew him through the volleyball team. Wu was the person who introduced them to Gu's house. Tan's lawyer Wang Jian requested in court that Gu Baosen's hiring of lawyers was not allowed because Gu was not the appellant, and the private suit had not been appealed. There was no explicit provision in the law, so Gu's lawyers should be asked to leave the court. Then Gu's lawyers Liu Zhen and Wang Peiyuan stood up to protest, causing a major conflict. The judge said that the case needed to investigate (1) the age issue and (2) the secret mark issue. The trial would be held again after the investigation. The issue of lawyers appearing in court should not be debated until the appropriate time. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Wu Huaichun Accused by a Woman from Changshu</p>
<h3 id="e155">Raped Young Daughter to Death, Then Raped Eldest Daughter and Abandoned Her <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The facts are extremely complicated... The judge hopes for a reconciliation</p>
<p>Wu Huaichun, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou who owns many properties in Shanghai, resides at No. 24, Lane 5, Ximen Road in the French Concession, and has established Yinyu Company there to manage rental accounts. He is now being sued in the Second Special District Court by Shi Chenshi, a woman from Changshu, through her lawyer, for criminally raping her fifteen-year-old daughter Lingyu to death and, while Lingyu was ill, raping her nineteen-year-old eldest daughter Jinghua, and then abandoning her shortly after. She is requesting that he be severely punished according to the law and is also filing a related civil suit. The case has already been opened for trial, and the parties involved, as well as physical evidence and photos, have already been published in newspapers and are well known to everyone. The case was scheduled for a continued hearing yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff, Shi Chenshi and her daughter Shi Jinghua, arrived at the court with their lawyers Wu Peng, Hu Jue, and He Yijun to report for the hearing at 2 p.m. The first defendant, Wu Huaichun, also arrived with his defense lawyer Pan Cheng. The second defendant, Fan Guilin, was represented by lawyer Zhu Dianqing. Fan's concubine, Fan Wengshi, also arrived on time. At the third ringing of the bell, Judge Li Changnian and Clerk Wang Baoxun took their seats in the Second Criminal Court for the hearing.</p>
<p>The audience was packed, with no empty seats. After the judge opened the court, the bailiff called the parties to the bar. Shi Chenshi stood in the defendant's box with her hair cut short, wearing a black woolen cheongsam. Shi Jinghua's hair was disheveled, and she was wearing a black fur-collared coat. Wu Huaichun was wearing a gray crepe robe and glasses. The lawyers for both sides also appeared in court one after another. The judge first asked the plaintiff and defendants their names, ages, origins, and occupations. Then, he asked Fan Wengshi, "Who are you to the defendant Fan Guilin?" She replied, "I used to live with Fan Guilin, but now we are separated. I live at No. 2 Zengle Lane. I received a summons and learned that this matter has nothing to do with Fan Guilin. I know the details of this matter, so I came to the court on behalf of Fan to await questioning." Plaintiff's lawyer Hu Jue stood up and said, "The second defendant, Fan Guilin, dared not appear in court and sent Wengshi to appear on his behalf, but a criminal defendant cannot be replaced by someone else. Please ask the court to order Weng to withdraw." Defendant's lawyer Pan countered, "Whether a party withdraws is within the court's jurisdiction and cannot be claimed by the plaintiff's lawyer." The two sides argued fiercely. The judge then ordered Fan Wengshi to withdraw to the audience and ordered both sides' lawyers to stop arguing. He then asked both parties, "This case has been postponed for a long time, have you ever reconciled outside the court?" Both sides answered that they had not reconciled. The judge ordered the plaintiff Shi Chenshi to state the facts regarding the accusation against Wu Yang Huaichun in relation to Lingyu's part. Chenshi said, "I am suing Wu for raping my daughter Lingyu to death, and I demand that he be punished." Then, because there was a language barrier in the court's questioning, her daughter Jinghua spoke on her behalf. She claimed that her mother called her younger sister to Shanghai to study. Because she met Fan Guilin, who was from the same hometown, she stayed at Fan's house. We knew that Fan was in the candy business and ran a shop. Later, Guilin said to my sister, "You are poor and can't afford to study. I will hire a teacher to teach you singing." My sister came to Shanghai in December of the year before last, when she was thirteen years old. The above information was sent to me in a letter from my sister in March of this year, saying that she lived at No. 14 Chengqing Lane and asked my mother to come to Shanghai to visit. The judge asked, "How did your sister meet the defendant Wu Huaichun while studying opera?" Jinghua replied, "Wu knew Fan Guilin. My sister was at Fan's house. On June 29th of the lunar calendar last year, she was raped by Wu at Fan's house." My mother and I were in the countryside, and my sister also told us in a letter. "Question: Why did your sister live with Wu Huaichun while studying opera?" Jinghua replied, "They must have</p>
<p>conspired together." Chenshi also said, "I didn't know at first. Lingyu told me when she was dying." The judge asked the defendant Wu Huaichun, "Did you hear what the plaintiff said?" Wu replied, "That's not true. I went to Zengrong Lane No. 2 this spring and saw Lingyu. They said she was a prostitute who was being held down. I don't know if she was paying her taxes. She was very sick, with a severe lung disease. She was getting worse and worse. Her mother was serving her by her side. I told them to get a good doctor to see her. The family said that Dr. Zhu Hegao had seen her and it didn't help. They wanted to send her to the hospital, but Lingyu was afraid and didn't want to go. Her mother discussed it with me and asked me to borrow a house for her to recuperate. Seeing her distress, I agreed to rent a two-story house in the living room of No. 119 Shiyin Lane on Glock Road. Chenshi and Lingyu moved in on April 23rd. I only took care of the medical expenses. The meals were provided by the Fan family. Then, her mother asked me to borrow 300 yuan, saying that after paying the Fan family back, they would no longer have to live at the Fan's house. I also agreed to lend it to her and paid it back on May 9th. Later, her mother said to me that because I had spent so much money, she was willing to send Lingyu to me as a concubine. At that time, I replied that the first thing was to treat the illness, and when she was better, the second thing was to go back to the countryside to study. Later, her mother brought up this matter again, and I agreed and gave 300 yuan as a loan as a betrothal gift. Later, Lingyu's sister also</p>
<p>came to Shanghai to visit her and take care of her. I also asked Dr. Zhang Chongmin to examine her, who said that she had reached the third stage of lung disease. On June 17th, Lingyu was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. She was still conscious. She died on the morning of the 18th. Chenshi called me and said to me that the person always belongs to you. All funeral matters should be handled by you. I immediately took the hearse to the Suzhou Guild Hall, prepared clothes and a coffin, and placed her in the Guild Hall. The judge asked, "Did you write the poem on the back of Lingyu's photo and the date of birth and death of the deceased?" He replied, "I wrote it to commemorate and worship in the future, so as not to forget. Lingyu is also named Yunzhen. I know that Fan Guilin is Fan Wengshi's husband. Wengshi manages the brothel, and Guilin has other businesses." At this point, Zhu Dianqing, the lawyer representing Fan Guilin, stood up and said that Fan Guilin's real surname was Wang and that he worked in the soy sauce business. He could not come today due to business, but he could come to the next court session. The judge then asked Shi Chenshi, "Did you hear what the defendant Wu Huaichun said?" She replied, "I don't know that Fan Guilin runs a brothel, but I know that he is a fellow villager and does</p>
<p>candy business. I didn't know that No. 2 Zengrong Lane was a brothel. The money for renting a house to treat my daughter's illness was provided by Wu. I did not pawn my daughter to a brothel, nor did I borrow 300 yuan from Wu to redeem my daughter. I did not promise to give my daughter to Wu as a concubine." The judge asked Wu, "Did you write a letter to Jinghua's fiancé Ding Hongsheng?" Wu took the letter, read it, and said that it was not his handwriting. The seal was his. Lingyu must have taken my seal when she was sleeping in the same bed with me while she was sick and stamped it when she was playing around. The judge then ordered Shi Jinghua to state the facts of the accusation against Wu. Jinghua claimed that she was raped and abandoned by Wu at No. 14 Chengqing Lane. On the third day of the fourth lunar month, I received a fast letter and telegram from my sister in the countryside, saying that she was sick. I immediately came to Shanghai to take care of my sister. On the 16th, my mother returned to the countryside to get clothes. I took care of my sister alone. I didn't sleep for eight days and eight nights. On the night of the 24th, Wu came and told me to go to bed and rest, and he would take care of her carefully. I was so tired that I fell asleep on the bed. Wu</p>
<p>took advantage of me being asleep, unbuttoned my pants, and raped me. When I woke up, he threatened and coaxed me, saying that he would pay money to break off my engagement with my fiancé and marry me. After my sister died, I returned to the countryside. Wu sent a letter, inviting me to Shanghai on the 14th day of the seventh lunar month, and instructed me to worship my sister on the 15th day. He asked me to come to Shanghai on the 14th day. He would pick me up at the Kunshan train station. When I arrived in Kunshan, I came to Shanghai with Wu and lived in the Wuling Apartment. He came every day at 6 a.m. and left at 10 a.m., or came at 8 p.m. and left at 10 p.m. I lived there for one month and five days, and then he abandoned me. Wu denied raping Jinghua, saying that when she returned to the countryside after her sister died, she agreed to come to Shanghai to worship her sister on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month. I opened a room in the Wuling Apartment for her. When I went to the train station to pick her up, because the apartment required writing the occupation, I wrote my name and occupation because she was a woman and had no occupation. There was no cohabitation or physical relationship. The judge asked Wu, "Did you and Jinghua</p>
<p>take photos together?" Wu replied, "She asked me to go with her to take them. She wanted me to take them together for fun." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer Hu Jue said that No. 14 Chengqing Lane, Baire Road, was the location of the defendant's crime, and asked if the court wanted to investigate. The judge then announced that the case would be postponed for two weeks for another hearing and ordered the plaintiff's lawyers to number all the exhibits and submit them to the court. He also said that the case was a private prosecution, and it would be best if a reconciliation could be reached outside the court. The plaintiff's lawyers said that the crime committed by the defendant Wu Huaichun was very serious and should be punished with the death penalty or, at the very least, life imprisonment, according to the criminal law. According to the situation of today's questioning, they were afraid that the defendant would escape during the postponement and requested that the defendant be taken into custody. Wu's lawyer objected, saying that Wu would definitely attend every court session and would not escape. Please do not take him into custody. The judge then instructed the defendant Wu Huaichun to post bail and await instructions, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Rural Education <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>In the first semester of last year, I had an idea to write a book on the rural economy of China. I had completed more than 70,000 words of the introduction, but unfortunately, the January 28th Incident destroyed it along with the school. However, this idea has always been in my mind and has never disappeared. Therefore, I always pay close attention to anything related to this issue. Undoubtedly, in the rural problem, which is also the Chinese problem, "universal education" is the most urgent issue at present. According to statistics, 93% of the population is illiterate. Now, the general educated people can feel the importance of this issue and are working hard, especially the efforts of the Popular Education Promotion Association in Ding County and the Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society, which must be regarded as a ray of dawn for the future of rural education in China.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, how much effectiveness can universal compulsory education have in rural areas? In the current environment, I am a bit skeptical. According to experience, only a very small number of people attend free schools. I think that free schools in rural areas are likely to conflict with work if they teach during the day: at night, after a day of labor, after dinner, they fall asleep. After working for twelve hours, it is impossible and should not be asked to use their brains for two hours. Even if we only refer to school-age children, according to what I have heard in conversations in rural areas, they are often unwilling to send their children to school.</p>
<p>The reason is that in the current economic environment, it is so difficult to maintain a family's livelihood with one person's income. Therefore, in our area, when children are eight or nine years old, they go out to look after cattle, and daughters are mostly sent to be adopted daughters-in-law. Because more consumption by one person means less production by one person on the other hand; children of eight or nine years old cannot be expected to produce, but because they are given to herd cattle, their own living problems can be solved without the need for their parents to maintain them. In most rural families, even the livelihood of one child is difficult to maintain. The increase in the number of orphanages is a very superficial proof. Therefore, even if compulsory education is implemented, how can it be possible to voluntarily send children to school? Even if it is possible to implement compulsory education, how will the resulting livelihood problems be solved? "Studying is okay, but how about life?" I often hear similar conversations.</p>
<p>Let's take a step back and allow rural children to enter school at the age of six and study until the age of ten. This is easier to do in practice. But what can be gained from these four years of education? What's more, often at the age of eight at most, their fathers and brothers must also make them a part of the production?</p>
<p>However, the urgent need to popularize education is an urgent issue in all aspects. Difficulties must be overcome, but how to overcome them? Let us assume that the implementation of universal education has a considerable solution in terms of funding, but how can we achieve the goal of universal education? How can we make fathers and brothers willing to send their children to school without conflicting with their livelihoods? These are all problems.</p>
<p>To answer the above questions, we can say very beautifully that this is an inevitable phenomenon under private ownership, so we must break the current economic organization in order to achieve it. But this is a bit too ambitious, and the immediate urgent problem must be broken immediately. Theoretical insights must also take into account reality.</p>
<p>I feel that this is not just my personal problem, and I am afraid that everyone who has been engaged in rural education has this doubt. Therefore, I dare to make a request to the teacher to answer it. If it can be made public, it is also what I deeply hope for. (Letter from Bao Zuxuan)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The questions raised by Bao are indeed worthy of public discussion. We will temporarily put them forward for public discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Women and Occupations <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>I have been married for three years and now have a two-year-old child. My husband works as a clerk in a foreign firm. Because there are few people in our family and the expenses are light, our life is quite comfortable. ::: I always thought that living this mundane life was too boring. ::: Women should also have occupations. ::: Although I studied for a few years before I got married, I can't say I have any professional skills. So I plan to go back to school, so that I can find a suitable job in the future. I told him this idea, but unexpectedly he strongly opposed it. He said that once a woman is married, she does not need a career, "washing clothes, cooking, and giving birth to children" is her career. Sir, isn't this too insulting to women? I argued with him several times, but to no avail; but the money is in his hands, what other way do I have besides asking him for it? Therefore, I feel the need for economic independence even more. )::: Sir, what do you think is best? (Message from Ms. Ao Wanying)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Women should have occupations" is a brilliant idea: it is indeed ten thousand times higher than the current women who only know how to consume and cannot produce. The lady's request is of course legitimate. However, our advocacy of women's occupations or women's economic independence is not all-encompassing. The general opinion is that women's occupations or women's economic independence seems to take a confrontational meaning towards men; this is really a misunderstanding. To put it correctly, negatively opposing women's dependent life, like parasites increasing social consumption, and positively advocating women's participation in social production, whether directly or indirectly. We hope that women will participate in production with the spirit of human mutual assistance, but we never want women to have a mentality of competing or refusing to show weakness. On this point, we should completely eliminate the concept of gender differences for thousands of years. We are all just people: we are just doing our best. If we must compete to do men's things, and abandon the things that women should do or that only women can do, then this is contrary to the basic principle of production | the principle of division of labor. As for "washing clothes, cooking, and giving birth to children" being a woman's occupation, it is indeed "insulting to women" in wording, but not in meaning. "Washing clothes, cooking, and giving birth to children" are indeed women's affairs, but these things are not necessarily lowly. Managing the household and the head of state governing national affairs do not differ in terms of the significance of production, and may even be more fundamental. Children's education is even more related to the future of the country and the nation. Unfortunately, the current school education only has the function of enlightenment, and completely lacks the function of edification: then, who can bear this great responsibility other than ordinary mothers? If a woman can wholeheartedly educate her children and make them perfect citizens, it is much greater than abandoning her children to earn a salary of a few tens of dollars a month. If the lady understands the greatness and importance of her own responsibility, she will definitely be interested. Moreover, now that she is in charge of household affairs and the child is still young, she naturally feels economically well-off. Once she goes to school, she will inevitably have to hire servants at home, plus</p>
<p>the expense of tuition, which adds two burdens out of thin air, which is very uneconomical. If you feel the need to study, you may wish to prepare books and study on your own in your spare time. In short, the spirit of mutual assistance is the key to the success of all undertakings; "arguing with him" is useless to everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Zhu Suixuan, a Rascal from Yancheng, Impersonates a Section Chief of the China Merchants Bureau <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Sets up an office in the Tingzi (pavilion) building</p>
<p>Introduces jobs to swindle movement expenses</p>
<p>Many photos of the swindled people are copied out</p>
<p>There are even congratulatory letters from prostitutes in Yancheng</p>
<p>Zhu Suixuan, a native of Yancheng, is 26 years old, with the alias Tie Mei. He was a rascal in academic circles in his hometown, addicted to prostitution and gambling, and despised by the masses, making it difficult for him to gain a foothold in society. At the beginning of this month, he came to Shanghai and rented a pavilion room on the upper floor of No. 674 Dongyalv Road to set up a fraudulent institution. He posted a sign on the door saying "China Merchants Company Office, No Entry for Idlers", and printed business cards, on which he wrote "Member of the Executive Committee and Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Central China Merchants Bureau". He wore a Western suit and leather shoes, looking very handsome. He falsely claimed that he could introduce positions such as inspectors and dockworkers of the China Merchants Bureau, with high salaries. More than 20 people, including Wang Yuejiang and Yin Zhaofeng, were fooled by him, and the introduction fees swindled from them amounted to hundreds of gold. The day before yesterday at noon, Yin Zheng hosted a dinner for Zhu and invited a friend surnamed Zhang to accompany him. He also told him that he had been recommended by Section Chief Zhu to the position of inspector of the Central China Merchants Bureau and would be able to start work soon. It was said that this was a good position and would bring considerable benefits in the future. He had already given him 40 yuan for movement expenses. Zhang saw that Zhu Suixuan was a slippery character, and that the office of the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the China Merchants Bureau was so large, how could it be set up in a pavilion room? He was being deceived, so he secretly reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Xu Yongyuan, together with Western detective Ke Laosi, to arrest Zhu. In the pavilion room, they copied out a wooden square seal of the China Merchants Company, a stack of introduction coupons, the defendant's business card and a roll of newspaper clippings of news about the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau, as well as more than 20 photos of people who entrusted him to introduce jobs, all of which were taken to the police station. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, described the situation in detail, and said that according to the appearance of the people who were swindled by the defendant in this case, there were 22 people, but only five people had been brought to justice, and the rest could not be traced and summoned. He presented all the evidence and asked for an extension to investigate the matter in detail. According to Wang Yuejiang, a native of Yancheng, who was involved in the case, he knew the defendant as a fellow villager. On the 4th of this month, he met him on Yangshupu Road and asked him where he was working. He replied that he was not. He said that he could find him a job as an inspector of the China Merchants Bureau, but he needed 30 to 40 gold for movement expenses. He pleaded with him to reduce it. As a result, he sent 20 yuan on the 11th to the defendant's pavilion room office. He said that he did not need to take a photo and gave him his business card and his portrait as a receipt, and promised that he could go to work in the bureau on the 15th. When the deadline arrived, he made excuses to delay it, and then he knew he had been deceived. Yesterday, he reported to the police station. According to Yin Zhaofeng, a native of Taizhou, he did not know the defendant and was introduced by his nephew surnamed Chen. He paid a total of 40 yuan for movement expenses to fill an inspector position and was fooled by him. According to Wei Mingde, a native of Gaoyou, the defendant promised to introduce him to work as a worker at the China Merchants Bureau dock and was swindled out of 20 yuan. According to Chen Liansan, a native of Tongzhou, he lived with the defendant. He said that he was working at the China Merchants Bureau and had an office in the pavilion room. In the past, he saw that his friends who came were all well-dressed. He claimed to be introducing odd jobs at the dock and swindled him out of only two yuan. According to Wang Yaosheng, a native of Yancheng, he also lived with the defendant. He made excuses to introduce business to me and swindled me out of half a month's food expenses. When questioned, the defendant confessed that the seals, business cards, etc. were all bought from old goods stalls, and the rest of his供支吾, 沈炳榮推事向其詳詰良久, 不肯直言, 遂諭仍還押, 改期再核. The police station requested that the various victims of the fraud report to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. A letter from Yun Lan, a famous prostitute in Yancheng, was also found in the defendant's pavilion room, saying that she had come to congratulate him on his appointment as "my dear brother's" glorious position, which was quite a strange story.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Central Police Station Will Build a New Building <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Central Police Station of the Public Concession will build a new building in the spring of next year. The location is west of Jiangxi Road on Simalu (Fourth Avenue) (i.e., opposite the current site). This construction plan has been drafted by the Works Department and approved by the Garrison Committee. According to the acting director of the Works Department, the building will cost approximately 550,000 taels, and 350,000 taels will be paid in advance in next year's budget. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Rent Should Be Collected According to the National Calendar Standard <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Civil Judgment of the First Special Court</p>
<p>Appeal of Jardine Matheson Dismissed</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson of Nanjing Road in this port previously claimed that Lang Jingji, the owner of the semi-Tianbao Zhai store at No. 84 Jiujiang Road, did not pay the rent according to the lunar calendar calculated by the bank. Shen Licheng, the manager of the bank, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Summary Court of the First Special District Court in the capacity of legal representative according to the principle that the law is not retroactive. After the court tried the case, it ruled that since the lunar calendar was issued by law, the rent should be collected according to the National Calendar. Jardine Matheson declared its disagreement in court and hired lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Tang Huaiqun to appeal to the Special District Local Court. It is now known that the case has been heard by the three judges of the court, Li Hu, Yang Peng, and Shen Hong, and the judgment result has been announced, Jardine Matheson's appeal was dismissed, and all rent collection should still be based on the National Calendar standard. The court's reasons for the judgment are excerpted as follows: The undisputed fact is that the appellant has not paid the rent for six months from February to July of this year. The dispute is whether the calculation method should be based on the National Calendar or the lunar calendar. This court has found that the lunar calendar has been explicitly abolished by the National Government, and the general commerce has also switched to the National Calendar. The appellant has failed to independently uphold a different view and still uses the lunar calendar to collect rent. The original trial was calculated according to the National Calendar and ordered the appellant to repay 432.5 taels of silver, which is not inappropriate. The statement that the law is not retroactive is for vested rights. In this case, the appellant claimed to switch to the National Calendar in accordance with laws and regulations and did not pay the rent calculated according to the lunar calendar to the appellant, so there is no retroactivity to speak of. Further investigation found that the appellant's failure to pay rent was due to the unresolved issue of switching to the National Calendar, which is different from ordinary rent arrears.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Overseas Chinese Association is Scheduled to Be Established <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Association was initiated by Guo Shun, Zheng Hongnian, Tang Haian, Wu Chengyu, Liu Shimu, Ou Weiguo, Wang Daoan, and more than 50 people from political, business, and academic circles in this port. Once it was proposed, everyone responded, and more than 200 overseas Chinese from home and abroad have joined the initiators. Recently, Dr. Wang Zhengting, a member of the Central Committee, Xiao Quandai, a consultant of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the National Government, Huang Beihong, the general manager of the Honolulu Free News, Chen Jie, an executive member of the French General Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, Liu Rongchu, the chairman of the Chinese Association of Masatlan Port in Mexico, Li Shaoyue, an executive member of the Mexican Zhicheng Branch of the Kuomintang, Guan Jixuan, the chairman of the Jiujiang Association of Nicaragua in South America, Lin Shizong, the general representative of the National Road Construction Association in Nanyang, and dozens of others have all been listed as initiators, which shows that the establishment of a comprehensive liaison organization for overseas Chinese in Shanghai is suitable for both people and place, and all overseas Chinese are strongly supporting it due to environmental needs. Moreover, the people in charge of the Overseas Chinese Association have precise plans, so the preparations have been made for less than two months, and the number of people who have joined the initiators has reached the above number, which shows that the progress is not only well-organized, but also has a considerable scale. It is now heard that the association plans to hold an inaugural meeting in February next year. In order to determine the foundation for its establishment, a third plenary meeting of all initiators will be convened at the New World Restaurant on Nanjing Road on the evening of the 24th of this month to discuss the association's constitution and stipulate specific methods for expanding the recruitment of members. Wu, the mayor, is a pillar of the party and the country. He has always loved overseas Chinese and has spared no effort. The preparatory committee's presidium has initiated a meeting to welcome Mayor Wu and invite Mayor Wu to guide the association's work and give a speech on the truth of the Great Shanghai Plan, so as to make a resolution and notify overseas Chinese all over the world to assist Mayor Wu in completing the aforementioned large-scale construction and create a new record for the Republic of China. It is said that the welcome meeting will be held next week.</p>

<p>Xu Fengsheng, a self-surrendered smoker (Xin Zha Ganzhang Dang, Xu's correspondence address), has been accepted by the Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Center of Shanghai Hospital in the Nanshi District and has been quitting smoking in accordance with regulations. The self-surrendered smoker yesterday specifically submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for filing. It is said that his original presentation stated that he accidentally ate opium due to illness, but his conscience was clear. He deeply regretted violating the criminal law and was determined to surrender to quit smoking. Therefore, he specifically complied with the instructions of the Municipal Government's Order No. 487 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, which stated that the task was to comply with the instructions. The case was approved by the Anti-Smoking Committee, stating that the association had previously consulted and requested the designation of hospitals to concurrently handle drug rehabilitation matters, and the establishment of municipal and county drug rehabilitation centers, and the detection of drug offenders, who were sent to hospitals and ordered to quit. The self-surrendered smoker deeply feared being caught one day and being unable to escape criminal charges. Therefore, he obeyed the order to surrender to the Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Center of Shanghai Hospital to quit smoking in order to restore my legal personality. In addition to the self-surrendered smoker currently being hospitalized for drug rehabilitation, this is to request your bureau to approve the filing, which would be a great kindness.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Recent Overview of School Hygiene Jointly Run by the Two Bureaus <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The first phase of work can be completed by the end of the year</p>
<p>The second and third phases of work will begin next spring</p>
<p>The school hygiene jointly run by the Municipal Health Bureau and the Education Bureau is originally divided into three phases. The first phase of work has begun at the beginning of this month and will be completed by the end of this year. The second and third phases of work will continue next year. The plan and current status of the work are explored below.</p>
<p>Past History School hygiene has been considered one of the main tasks since the establishment of the Health Bureau. Therefore, the handling has never been interrupted. However, since the January 28th Shanghai War this spring, most schools have suffered losses, and the Health Bureau's funds have also been very tight, so the work was temporarily suspended. Later, the former director, Hu Hongyi, believed that the work was very important, so he disturbed the restoration and drafted a plan to be implemented next spring. After the new director, Li Ting'an, took office after Director Hu's tragic car accident, he felt that health facilities should not be delayed and still consulted with the Education Bureau according to the original plan of the former director Hu and actively prepared for it, so it was implemented from last month.</p>
<p>Implementation Plan The facilities of school hygiene must be popularized, but due to economic relations, it is divided into three phases. The first phase is the municipal schools in the three districts of the city, Gaoyang Zhabei Nanshi. The second phase is the municipal schools in other districts of the city. The second phase is all municipal and private schools in the various districts of the city. The first phase of work is currently underway and will last until the end of this year. The second phase of work will be scheduled to begin depending on the results of the first phase.</p>
<p>Clinics Established The work currently underway includes the establishment of two clinics. The Zhabei District is located in Yinan Elementary School, and the Nanshi District is located in Wanzhu Elementary School. All medicines are supplied by the Health Bureau. If students in the schools in these two districts are sick, they can be sent to the above two clinics for treatment. However, because there are many schools, it is hoped that more clinics can be added in the short term to meet the needs. As for the physical examination of students in the various schools, it is also currently underway.</p>
<p>Special Clinics In addition to the above-mentioned clinics, there is also a dental clinic attached to the Municipal Education Bureau, which hires specialist dentists to treat dental diseases. There is also a scrofulous eye clinic, which is currently being planned and hopefully established in the short term. In addition to setting up clinics, training courses are also organized in the three districts. The Zhabei District is located in He'an Elementary School, the Nanshi District is located in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Gaoyang District is located in Gaoyang Elementary School. The municipal schools in the various districts must send three teachers and staff to attend lectures. The Health Bureau will send people to guide and lecture on common hygiene knowledge, general physiology, pathology, and first aid methods to make them understand the meaning and importance of hygiene facilities. The training courses are held at night, two hours each day, for a total of 32 hours to be completed. If good influence and effects can be obtained after completion, they will continue to be held and more content will be added.</p>

<p>Inspecting the Joint Military Drill of Nanyang and Fudan The Capital Training and Supervision Department sent military inspectors Ruan Kaiki, Chen Bingchang, and clerks to Shanghai to inspect the military training of various colleges. Yesterday was the joint military drill of Nanyang Model Middle School and Fudan High School in the third district of Xujiahui. The address was the playground of Nanyang Model Middle School. The training and supervision department, military inspectors Ruan Kaiki and Chen Bingchang, clerk Zhong Xiushi, Nanyang Model Middle School Principal Shen Tongyi, Dean of Studies Zhao Xianchu, journalist Ma Xiezhou, and more than a thousand teachers and students from the various schools, male and female, arrived. At approximately 2:00 PM, the chief commander, Ruan, reported the number of people and the arrangements. After everything was completed, the operation began. The first was the unarmed training of the first grade of Nanyang Model Middle School, followed by the gun training of the second grade. Instructor Ruan gathered the company commanders, platoon leaders, and squad leaders to lecture on the subjects.

<h3 id="e173">A Respectful Announcement to All National University and Middle School Students: Implementing Education to Save the Nation ((1) by You Huai-gao <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>(1) Three Major Problems in Saving the Nation</p>
<p>The nation has reached such a dangerous state that I believe there is not a single person who does not want to save it. Because if we do not save it, the nation will perish. When the time of national subjugation arrives, even if you have ardent hearts, I am afraid it will be too late. At the very least, you will have to endure a long period of slavery like the people of India. After being slaves, there will be a stain on our bright history of the Republic of China, which can never be erased. Now that the nation has not yet perished, there is still an opportunity to save it. Therefore, we should immediately decide on the following three problems concerning saving the nation:</p>
<p>First, who should take the lead in taking responsibility for implementing national salvation?</p>
<p>Second, how should we save the nation?</p>
<p>Third, how do we determine a common period and goal for saving the nation?</p>
<p>The people of China are said to number 400 million. In reality, it is impossible for all the people to participate in saving the nation. If we examine the people from the political, academic, agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles, we will realize that university and middle school students in the academic world, in terms of their status, responsibility, and value, should take the lead in taking responsibility for saving the nation. Therefore, I will first explain the status, responsibility, and value of university and middle school students, which will make it clear.</p>
<p>(2) The Status of University and Middle School Students</p>
<p>The government is currently unable to save the nation on its own because it cannot solve the four major issues of finance, military affairs, foreign affairs, and transportation. As a result, it cannot solve the four major issues of education, agriculture, industry, and commerce for the people. Although they know that without real industry, we cannot survive, and without education, we cannot establish the nation, they are genuinely in a position of being willing but unable to do so because they are busy with their own affairs. Understanding this principle means we do not need to rely entirely on the government, nor do we need to blame the government. Then, what should we do? We should request the government to advocate for things we are capable of doing and are confident in, and then, under the supervision of the government, we can build our future.</p>
<p>Looking at the farmers across the country, they have physical strength but lack intellect, they have conscience but lack practical strength, and they possess the virtues of diligence and thrift, but they lack the ability to strive forward. Before receiving education, they cannot participate in saving the nation. Looking at the workers across the country, they share the same fate as the farmers and are busy seeking survival and making a living, leaving them no time to participate in saving the nation. Looking at the merchants across the country, along with the most influential new bankers and new industrialists, they are all huddled in several treaty ports, each building their golden towers and silver vaults, and they may not be able to advocate for saving the nation.</p>
<p>If the government cannot save the nation, and the farmers, workers, and merchants do not come forward to save the nation, then who will take on this heavy and arduous task of saving the nation? After thinking it over, I can only ask the university and middle school students across the country to initiate this work of saving the nation.</p>
<p>Fellow students, you are the people in the country who have received higher education, who are known for loving the country and having passionate blood, you are people with healthy bodies and clear minds, you are people with relatively concrete plans, and you are the one out of every ten thousand people who can be leaders. Therefore, I believe that those who have received education above the high school level are the ones who bear the heavy responsibility of saving the nation. If you still do not come forward to save the nation, you will be as incapable as the government and the ignorant people. In the future, there is no need to scold the government, because scolding the government is scolding yourself. In the future, there is no need to laugh at others, because laughing at others is laughing at yourself. If you are not willing to take responsibility for saving the nation, China will undoubtedly perish. Therefore, I hope that you students will create some earth-shattering achievements. Although you are currently living in a dark society, under conservative families and corrupt governments, the frustration and depression in your hearts are greater than anyone else's, but you must never lose heart and fall into the path of self-destruction and debauchery. Because suicide and debauchery are mostly unavoidable social pathologies in times of extreme depression, but ultimately, you must strive for the future and take responsibility for improvement in order to maintain the true character of young patriots. Now that we have explained your position in saving the nation, let us talk about your responsibilities.</p>
<p>(3) The Responsibilities of University and Middle School Students</p>
<p>We have extremely vast land, but it is full of bandits, so developing agriculture is your responsibility. We have an extremely large population, but most of them are ignorant, so running education is your responsibility. We have inexhaustible treasures, but they are buried deep underground, so mining is your responsibility. We have thousands of years of civilization and history, but everything is backward, so promoting science is your responsibility. We have the oppression of strong neighbors, but no one can resist it, so improving military affairs is your responsibility. We have economic aggression and cannot save ourselves, so creating industries is your responsibility. This is not just empty talk that can be dismissed; we must gather countless agriculturalists, educators, engineers, scientists, military experts, and industrialists to work together wholeheartedly to succeed. You are all specialized talents, and you placed this responsibility on yourselves early on during your studies. Therefore, you will have to take on this responsibility sooner or later. However, the prerequisite issue is the entire education problem. Currently, there are countless specialized talents with true knowledge and practical skills who cannot get a corresponding position after graduating and develop their talents because the majority of the people are uneducated. The interior cannot thrive without education, and without the interior thriving, there are no great undertakings to be done. Without undertakings, there is no need for talents, so thousands upon thousands of highly educated talents gather in the metropolis, creating a situation where there are more people than jobs, leading to the tragic situation where people are not used for what they are good at, and what they are used for is not what they studied. Therefore, only the work of saving the nation through education can genuinely create countless opportunities and outlets for talents. This is your significant responsibility.</p>

<p>Focus on Referees</p>
<p>▲Jinan States:</p>
<p>Obscured by the Referee's Lack of Understanding of the Truth</p>
<p>▲Donghua States:</p>
<p>The Referee Should Not Allow Them to Continue the Game</p>
<p>Since the Western League Football Association held a competition between Jinan and Donghua and made four resolutions, both sides have expressed extreme dissatisfaction. The focus of both sides is on the referee. Donghua believes that since someone had already left the field at Jinan at that time, the referee should not have allowed them to re-enter the battle. This competition should be considered a forfeit. Jinan believes that the Western League completely misunderstood the truth of the matter at the time, being obscured by the referee's one-sided statement, and not understanding the seriousness of the matter. As a result, the team captain's qualification was suspended for a season as punishment. Both sides have filed severe protests, otherwise, they may take further action.</p>

<p>In the Jiangnan Eight University Football Championship, in the number of circular, I reach military-like meeting period, Jinan and Fudan meet with unbeaten records, with the ambition to resolve the championship. The only remaining opponent for both sides is Jiaotong University. They will face Jiaotong University again tomorrow. The referees yesterday were Wang and Fudan. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan University</p>
<p>Yun Feng           Wang Nanzhen</p>
<p>Shang Dong                    Zhang Hongzao</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe         Liang Shutang           Luo Shangjiu</p>
<p>Lai Zuorong                    Chen Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Deng Hanjie (Up)    Liu Zukan</p>
<p>Mai Tinglin (Down)</p>
<p>Fudan University</p>
<p>Gong Yixun (Up)</p>
<p>Zhang Rong     An Bingwu (Up)     He Jitang (Down)</p>
<p>Yang Mingjin         Wang Zhengyin (Down)     Cai Bingcheng</p>
<p>Guan Xunan     Wang Shusen           Yu Shunzhang</p>
<p>Feng Nianhan                    Zhou Shaowen</p>
<p>Li Lin</p>
<p>(One Defender, One Attacker) Surrounded by Three to Four Thousand Fans, the Battle Begins. Jinan Immediately Issues a General Attack Order, But Repeated Advances Are Repeatedly Blocked. Guan Xunan Guards the Back, Looking Left and Right, Spares No Effort. Yang Mingjin Also Carefully Guards the Goal. After Twenty Minutes of Jinan's Fierce Attack, They Achieve Nothing and Gradually Show Signs of Slackness. Fudan Takes This Opportunity to Start Pushing Forward, Approaching Jinan's Goal, But Either They Are Too Slow to Kick the Ball, or They Shoot Without Aim, and Their Efforts Are in Vain. In This Half Hour, One Attack and One Defense, One Advance and One Retreat, They Achieve Nothing. Luo Haiguang Is Determined and Repeatedly Shoots at the Goal from a Distance. At This Point, There Is a New Development.</p>
<p>(Haiguang Scores Continuously) The Stuffy Situation Is Broken Only in the Last Ten Minutes of the First Half. Yun Feng Passes the Ball Across the Field, and Liu Zukan Gets It and Advances Straight. The Defender Rushes Over. Liu Does Not Wait for Him to Arrive and Sends It to the Front of the Goal. Zhang Hongzao Charges Straight Alone. Guan Xunan Blocks, But Zhang Falls Before He Can Shoot. Yang Mingjin Is Too Close. Haiguang Shoots from the Gap in the Crowd and Scores. Jinan Opens the Scoring with a Score of 1-0. Although Fudan Kicks Off Again to Attack, It Is Again Obtained by Jinan. Liu Zukan Advances on the Right Side and Sends It Diagonally. Wang Nanzhen Responds on the Left Wing. Guan Xunan Flies Out. Liang Shutang Intercepts and Shoots from a Distance, Hitting the Top of the Goal and Bouncing Back. Zhang Hongzao Tries to Attack Again, But He Is Blocked by Guan. Pan Haiguang Comes Up and Pushes It In. Three Minutes Later, the First Half Ends. Jinan Wins 2-0.</p>
<p>(Nanzhen Headers the Ball) Fudan Loses Its Fighting Spirit Due to Losing Two Goals in a Row. They Actively Counterattack as Before. The Five Tigers Attack Together, Knocking on the City Gate. Yu Shunzhang Deeply Buries Himself in Heavy Defense. No One Is In Front of Him, and He Can Take It in One Fell Swoop. Who Would Have Thought That He Would Not Shoot at the Empty Goal but Fly It Out of the Woods? What a Pity. At This Time, Jinan's Five Forwards Have Switched Positions with Each Other. Liu Zukan Is in Wang Nanzhen's Position, Chen Zhenxiang Is Transferred Outward, Zhang Hongzao Pads Chen's Position, and Wang Nanzhen Is in Liu's Position. Zhang Hongzao Is Sometimes on the Right Wing, Circling a Few Times, and Wang Nanzhen Takes a Step Without Stopping and Heads the Ball into the Net. Only Five Minutes Have Passed Since the Start of the Second Half.</p>
<p>(Another One Comes) With Three Goals in a Row, Fudan Is Still Determined to Break Through the Opponent's Goal. They Have Opportunities, But They Lose to Luck and Their Own Feet. Lin Bingcheng Fiercely Attacks the Goal, As Fast as an Arrow, But Unfortunately, He Misses by Two Inches and Hits the Top of the Goal and Bounces Down. Yu Shunzhang Sends the Ball Diagonally from the Right Direction, But No One Is in Front of the Goal, and No One Receives It, Letting It Slip Away. What a Pity. Luo Haiguang Then Comes on to Refuel. Sure Enough, Another One Comes. Jinan Scores Its Fourth Goal and the Game Ends.</p>
<p>(Everyone Is Harmonious) Yesterday, the Sportsmanship on Both Sides Was Excellent, and They Were Extremely Harmonious. The Losers Still Strove to Win Despite Losing, and the Winners Still Did Not Relax Despite Winning. The Fighting Spirit Is Commendable. We Sincerely Hope to Maintain It for a Long Time. The Failure of Fudan Is Blamed on Something. The Action Is Slightly Slow, and They Missed Many Opportunities. The Defenders, However, Are Strong and Worthy of Praise. It Is Only Natural That the Excellent Ones Win, and Fudan Is Also Willing to Submit.</p>

<p>Score: 52-27</p>
<p>The Chih-Chih Basketball Team Met the Pirates at Xiqing Last Night, Planning to Vent Their Anger. However, the Pirates' Power Was Still Rampant, and Chih-Chih Lacked Strength, Eventually Losing 40-25. The Competition Was Tense and Exciting. In the Second Match, Xiaguang Suddenly Declined and Was Defeated by Jinan 52-27. From Today Onwards, There Will Be a Three-Day Christmas Break.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Pirates' Power Remains Rampant: Chih-Chih Suffers a Crushing Defeat <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>(Chih-Chih Can Defend but Cannot Attack) Chih-Chih Knows the Pirates' Ferocity, Strict Defense, and Quick Hands to Intercept the Ball, Which Is the First Taste the Pirates Have Experienced This Year. In the First Half, the Pirates Attacked Fiercely, But There Were Few Opportunities to Score. Chih-Chih Could Defend but Could Not Attack. With the Ball in Hand, They Immediately Shot from a Distance, Missing the Target 19 Times. The Power of the Yang and Qian Forwards, Who Used to Be 100% Accurate Years Ago, Has Disappeared. The Back Guards Intercepted Several Times, Otherwise, It Would Be the Pirates' World.</p>
<p>(Only 5 Minutes of Tension) At the Start of the Game, the Pirates Scored First, With Smith Scoring First and Hill Following. In an Instant, It Was 7-0. Kong Guangyi Scored a Two-Pointer from a Distance, and the Pirates Went Ahead Again 10-2. The Next Five Minutes Were the Most Exciting Part of the Game. The Xia Brothers Scored Twice in a Row, Suddenly Closing the Gap to 8-10, Only Two Points Behind. However, After These Five Minutes Passed, the Situation Changed Again. The First Half Ended With a Score of 16-9. At the Start of the Second Half, Chih-Chih Scored First, But the Pirates Scored 10 More Points in a Row, Making It 26-11. From Then On, It Was Irreversible. The Game Ended With a Score of 40-25.</p>

<p>Xia Guang's performance last night was almost like two different people compared to their previous one. They appeared very fatigued. Jinan, on the other hand, maintained a quick pace, scoring repeatedly. Their shots were frequently brilliant, and everything went smoothly, resulting in a completely one-sided game. The score was 23 to 10 in the first half and 52 to 27 at the end.</p>

<p>The Zhijiang University basketball team played against the Jiaotong University team at 7 PM last night at the Xujiahui Jiaotong University field. The Jiaotong University team is the Nanxing team, which is a strong team in the Group A basketball league in the West. Although Zhijiang played cautiously, the field was too large and they were not used to playing on it. As a result, their formation was scattered and disorganized. In the end, Zhijiang lost again, 25 to 56. Today at 4 PM, Zhijiang will go to Fanwangdu to play against St. John's University.</p>
<p>At the beginning of yesterday's game, Zhang Guowei of Zhijiang scored first, but after that, there were no scores for a long time. Both sides seemed unfamiliar with their skills and had little confidence in their shots. At the end of the first half, Jiaotong University led 16 to 11. From the second half onwards, Jiaotong University's momentum suddenly increased. Zhou Baigui, Fang Xindi, and Zhang Daqi all worked hard and performed well. From Zhijiang, Wang Pusheng and Zhang Guowei were the most active, but unfortunately, Chen Yaosheng, the main guard, was fouled out four times, which weakened their defense and allowed Jiaotong University to become even more rampant. The final score was 56 to 25, giving the victory to the home team. The referee was Wu Jiatang.</p>

<p>Reaching an Unprecedented Peak</p>
<p>805.8 Taels</p>

<p>(The Unsteady Morning Market) Yesterday, London's spot silver fell 0.25, and forward silver fell 0.3125. The Bank of America also lowered prices by 0.25. Forward silver prices decreased slightly by 0.03. American cotton experienced a minor increase of 0.0005 or 0.0006 per pound. Despite the rise in exchange rates, ranging from 0.05 to 0.01, there was no significant concern, and market sentiment remained stable. Overnight short sellers began to cover their positions, causing gold futures to open at 819.8 taels. Zhejiang Jin bought January U.S. dollars at 27.4375 yuan. Hengxing, Hengyu, and Dachen procured bullion, rising from 9.8 taels to 21 taels. Although the exchange market was tighter than the previous close, the varying opinions among dealers due to the high opening price caused the price to fluctuate between 1 and 2 taels despite numerous transactions. As Bingxing added more orders, prices rose further. Later, banks traded March U.S. dollar exchange at 27.5 yuan, and Fuxing, Yongzhi, and Fengyong all bought in, breaking the flat trend and becoming more bullish, rising to over 4 taels. Qingfa and Yongfuyu sold aggressively, and Dachen also exited. HSBC sold March British exchange at 6.875, decreasing to 1.5 taels.

Qingfa and Yongfuyu sold again, falling back to a little over 2 taels. Many retail investors entered the market, rising to 3.2 taels, and were sold successfully.

After this, the banks' internal market was extremely flat, with March U.S. dollars at 0.0625 available for sale and settlement, fluctuating by a few qian around 21 taels. The market atmosphere was calm. After 4:15 PM, Tianfengyong and Daxingyong eagerly bought, and general bulls strongly pushed up prices, rising to 2.7 taels, but Hengyu followed closely and sold, falling back to 0.0009, closing at 0.000134. Materials were auctioned at 0.0008. The highest gold price was 25.8 taels, and the lowest was 17.5 taels, with a fluctuation of over 8 taels. As a result, the closing price was 4 taels higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>(The Announced Price Squeezes 63 Taels Strongly) The announced price was 884.79 taels due to the U.S. dollar exchange rate being 0.000375 lower, squeezing over 63 taels (based on the "by the plate" rate).

Although there was slightly more activity in the afternoon, there were still no medium-sized transactions. Concerning the trend of prices, the market was in a wait-and-see mood, with supply and demand relatively balanced. Overall, the buying sentiment was weaker than before, resulting in a general decline, only by about 4-5 jiao. Only financial futures rose by 7 jiao compared to the beginning of the week. 19 Customs rose by 0.5 yuan, and Demobilization and Salt Tax spots each decreased by 0.7-0.8 jiao. Observing the situation in the bond market, it has entered a state of chaos and is not expected to experience any major changes in the near future, as the year is coming to an end, and the market is extremely quiet. Total spot trading for the day was only 10,500 yuan. Total futures trading for the morning and afternoon was 405,000 yuan. There was no market for short-term financial instruments.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported on Wednesday, December 21st: The New York Stock Exchange saw mixed results. Industrial stocks remained relatively strong, while railroad stocks were weak due to the Central Georgia Railroad's announcement of liquidation. Tobacco stocks were also very weak, as companies are planning to lower cigarette prices due to increased competition. Steel Magazine estimates that the steel workload for this week is 14%, and below 10% in the Chicago area. It is expected that before January, areas like Pittsburgh will also drop to 10%.

<h3 id="e203">Many Cotton Yarn Deliveries This Month <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn in storage reaches 14,500 bales</p>
<p>Cotton yarn sales remain sluggish, with buyers showing no movement, resulting in a flat market. However, the yarn auction market remains firm, as raw cotton prices are rising and gold prices are difficult to lower. Therefore, speculators tend to buy long. As for deliveries this month, many are flooding the market. Cotton yarn warehouses are piling up with 14,500 bales of 20-count yarn, putting severe pressure on the yarn market.</p>
<p>(Heavy Pressure on the Auction Market) At the opening of the auction market, although American cotton prices fell, exchange rates caused prices to rise by 0.002-0.003. In the second and third sessions, actual demand was weak, causing prices to fall by 0.001-0.002. The afternoon market remained weak, falling by 0.001-0.00125. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,000 bales. Changfeng sold 900 bales, Yuantai 800 bales, Ji 700 bales, and He 800 bales, Dafeng 750 bales. Ruidai bought 3,550 bales, Gengfeng 700 bales, Tongfu 650 bales, and Yichang 600 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>February 14,480 Down 0.0002 57,300 Total 268,300</p>
<p>(Sluggish Yarn Sales) Sales of spot yarn remain slow. The total amount of current and forward yarn bought by various buyers was 413 bales. Prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of various buyers are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 60 Changsha 10 Shantou 7</p>
<p>Traders 30 Ningbo 10 Inland 286</p>

<p>The cotton market remains firm as usual. Although American and Indian cotton markets have fallen, exchange rates have shortened the gap, resulting in an implicit rise in prices. Buying sentiment remains strong, and spot cotton demand is healthy. The market is slightly weak, but buyers flock in. The future of the cotton market lacks certainty.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Market Still Rising) At the opening of the Zheng Biao market in the morning, prices rose with the gold market. The second and third sessions were flat. Near-month prices fell by 0.0005-0.0015, while far-month prices rose by 0.0005. The afternoon market was firm, but Ruidai bought a large amount. According to a partial survey, a certain manufacturer's rented velvet cotton in Tianjin and Shandong will likely not be delayed. The total transaction volume for the day was 57,300 dan. Jifeng sold 1</p>

<p>English and Indian Cotton Slightly Soft | Egyptian Spot Prices Rise Two Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm and unremarkable. Futures prices fell by 5 to 6 points, spot prices fell by 10 points. English cotton futures fell by 3 to 4 points, spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 2 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Pingguoer futures falling by 1.25 rupees, Aomula falling by 1.5 rupees, and Bailuo Creek falling by 1 rupee.

<p>| Floating Traders and Manufacturers Have Large-Scale Hedging |</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the market opened in the morning, foreign wheat was quoted up by 12 cents. Continuing the momentum of the previous day's surge, the near and far months consistently quoted higher at the opening. However, both the Beiyang and Renlian groups had already satisfied their appetite. A portion of the 帮 group sold out with the market. Floating traders and Fufeng Factory, etc., all had large amounts of hedging, and the market immediately saw dramatic changes. The decline in the far months was even more frantic. The near months had the strong support of Fuxin and a portion of the traders, so the market did not see a huge fall. Prices closed lower for the months below February, with March down by a small 3.25 cents, February and April each down by a small 2.75 cents, May down by a small 2.25 cents, January down by a small 2 cents, and the current month down by a small 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Fujian Traders Continue to Purchase Hakka Xiang Rice <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>| Feng Hu Stops Purchasing and Switches to Lower River Rice |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka Xiang rice market situation showed that Fujian province had a strong appetite, and the market slightly turned around. High-grade glutinous and non-glutinous Xiang rice each gradually approached one cent. Medium and lower grades were stable. The entire market opened with around 2,000 bags. Among them, besides the Quanzhou traders purchasing 400 bags, all were purchased by 漳州 traders. The Northern traders and hoarders had no appetite. The Northern traders said that because rice prices in that area were falling, transportation and sales were not worthwhile. Even the usually popular Clear Water Bo Dao rice has recently fallen to around 11 yuan. When calculated with the Shanghai market price, it is also not profitable. Therefore, although Su rice has the possibility of transshipment, its appetite cannot be smooth. Yesterday, all types of rice from the Lower River fell. Hoarders took the opportunity to buy, so they did not pay attention to Hakka Xiang rice. Hakka Xiang rice had a small improvement due to sufficient inventory. Fortunately, the arrival of new supplies has not been strong recently, and the Fujian traders' buying appetite is still strong, so the market has managed to stabilize. The entire day saw purchases of 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at prices of 8.50 to 8.34 yuan, 150 bags of 砶 early rice at a price of 6.5 yuan, 250 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice at prices of 9.75 to 9.65 yuan, and 525 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice at prices of 8.80 to 8.67 yuan.</p>

<p>A Newfong &amp; Co. report on Chicago wheat Wednesday (21st): First it fell due to long liquidation, then it rose due to Winnipeg wheat being firm. The volume traded on the 20th totaled 10 million bushels. The market prices on the 21st are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price            Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December Futures      44.372           Up 0.375</p>

<p>| Bidding Rises Five Points |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the bid price rise again to over 820 taels, and the guild became visibly nervous. No. 24 coarse grain white sugar was priced at 15 taels and 6 qian, up 1 qian from the previous day (20th). No. 18 medium grain white sugar also rose 1 qian, priced at 14 taels and a half. No. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugars were stable, with no significant fluctuations. The new tide of green sugar had another 1,600+ bags arriving via the Hengsheng Wheel, increasing inventories. However, according to telegrams from the production area yesterday, the buying price is trending firmer, and the future market looks tight. Sales here are also still lively, so bidding is quite stable. Over 1,000 bags were opened yesterday, with the higher-priced goods opening at 8 taels and 9 qian, up 5 fen from the previous day. The lowest was 8 taels and 4 qian. There is hope that the future market may improve.</p>
<p>According to a New York telegram on the 21st, the spot sugar market was stable, with the price remaining at 8.125 cents per pound. Futures for December, January, March, and May each fell by a small 2 points, while July and September each fell by a small 1 point. In London, December and May rose by a large halfpenny, March rose by 0.75. Javanese white sugar, both near and far months, fell by a small 3 pence.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign merchant tea market, Zhenmei green teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi, handled by English firms like Jinjiang, Tongfu, and Tianxiang, were actively purchased due to telegrams from Morocco relayed to Shanghai. Total transactions in the entire city reached over 500 boxes. Top-grade Wuyuan Zhuang core-extracted teas were sold at a top price of 125 taels. Ordinary teas were sold at prices of 68 to 77 taels, with little change from before. For Gongxi pearl tea, several Baotou firms showed some interest, but the selling price fell by 2-3 taels compared to before. Other varieties such as Zhenmei and Xiumei had no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Rayon Sales Not Quiet <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local rayon market saw frequent sales, with the Ningbo traders following up with purchases. Yesterday, the guild saw 65 boxes of Class A Golden Kirin, Black Beauty, and No. 1 and 2 Red Fish brand futures for January and February being sold, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Hardware: Hardware Prices Driven Higher by Foreign Exchange <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, as foreign exchange rates tightened frequently, the settlement price for hardware imports increased significantly. Therefore, various standards in the market are continuing to advance, such as tinplate, new lead wire, galvanized iron sheets, plain galvanized iron, steel bars, pig iron, and foreign dollar square plates. Iron products are rising steadily, but the actual transactions are not improving. This is because the end of the year is approaching and financial tightening is occurring. However, hoarders with abundant capital have recently had the intention of buying spot goods for stockpiling. This is because the foreign exchange rate is tight and prices are high, while Shanghai's prices are low and inventory is shallow. If actual transactions start, the supply and demand will not meet, and a surge in prices can be expected.</p>

<p>Hunan pure antimony, which has been in short supply for a long time, arrived at Taikoo Docks yesterday, totaling 12 tons (120 boxes). It was found that it was purchased by a hardware store in the French Concession.</p>

<p>Major Traders Hoarding for Speculation</p>
<p>Small Retailers Suffer Significant Losses</p>
<p>Kailuan lump coal, previously due to 峰煤 銷 sales, the company reduced prices for bargain sales, selling for only 6.5 taels per ton. Recently, the market's spot supply is moving, and it feels lacking. Ordinary peer retailers find it quite difficult to purchase it for a time. The reason is that the company's arrivals are all pre-ordered by major traders who are hoarding it for speculation. Therefore, the selling price has secretly increased. The market's quoted prices yesterday were still at 6.5 taels from the company, but there were no goods available for transaction. However, the major traders were selling for over 7 taels per ton. According to observations by ordinary people, prices are expected to rise further during the Lunar New Year.</p>

<p>— Heng</p>
<p>From that day on, Little A Mao refused to step into the high-walled house with the courtyard ever again.</p>
<p>He was only twelve years old this year and had a father who used to be a copper craftsman and was now a zinc craftsman. His father had a nose that was reddened by alcohol; his own nose was red for three seasons of the year because he didn’t have enough clothes. Not only red, but also constantly running. As for his mother, he had no recollection of her in his small memory. Simply put, there were only two of them: father and son, son and father. The two ate together and slept together.</p>
<p>And the father, as usual, had the temper of a man who loved to drink. During the day, he would make his son do things that almost only an adult could do. In his mind, Little A Mao had been snotty for more than ten years, which was not a small amount; if he really couldn't do it, a mouth would help him do it. At night, he would spread himself out like a clumsy ox, squeezing the little one into a corner, unable to sleep and unable to move; as soon as the sky turned white, he would kick him out of the sweaty, alcohol-smelling quilt, so that he could sleep comfortably by himself until broad daylight.</p>
<p>For all of this, Little A Mao never resisted, and no matter how much he was beaten or scolded, he never cried.</p>
<p>The two of them lived like this, in the most dilapidated room in a broken alley, stealthily, monotonously, and solitarily, as if they had been forgotten by all of mankind.</p>
<p>But some usual families would always think of the copper craftsman A Fa whenever they needed to install a skylight or repair a roof.</p>
<p>On such days, we would see Little A Mao carrying a long iron tube on his back, which was not much smaller than his own body, following his father, who had his hands free, taking three steps and running two steps into those high-walled houses. He watched his father work, handing him the hammer and the scissors. When he didn't need to hand him the scissors or the hammer, he stood there blankly, looking at this and looking at that.</p>
<p>But his eyes were sharp, sharp and deep.</p>
<p>That day was the same. It was cold that day, and he was only wearing a thin cotton jacket and pants. He squatted by the stove that his father used for work like a cat warming itself by the stove, his face and sleeves covered in snot. He was waiting for his father's command, and the knuckle-rapping that often came with it. "Add charcoal!" the command came.</p>
<p>Little A Mao was afraid of being too slow, and quickly grabbed a large pair of fire tongs with his small hands.</p>
<p>Now, that family had a girl who was about ten years old. In his haste to grab the fire tongs, Little A Mao inadvertently touched the edge of her clothes with his sleeve. The girl quickly pulled back, looked at him, and with a feminine gesture, took out a handkerchief and wiped her clothes for a long time.</p>
<p>"Filthy, so disgusting!" As if talking to herself.</p>
<p>He wanted to answer, "Who told you to walk over here?" But with his father there, he didn't dare to do so.</p>
<p>He just stared at her with deep eyes.</p>
<p>That girl was naturally very clean, her hair was slicked back, and her face was covered in powder and rouge, just like a fashionable young woman. Like a little goblin, Little A Mao thought in his heart; he remembered that his father often called the women who dressed extravagantly goblins. But he just thought it, his anger still couldn't subside. "Your mom is..." He thought even more maliciously, but the anger was still the same.</p>
<p>A Fa climbed onto the roof.</p>
<p>"Pump the bellows," he shouted from above.</p>
<p>Little A Mao huffed and puffed as he pumped the bellows below. While pumping, he was paying attention. At first, he pumped very slowly, but when the "little goblin" came closer, he pushed hard inside.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" The other one cursed like a ghost.</p>
<p>Seeing the "little goblin" covered in ash, he felt comfortable in his heart; "You came up to me yourself," he said victoriously.</p>
<p>"This place is ours, not yours, can't I come here!"</p>
<p>"We're working."</p>
<p>"Little devil, if you're working, you'll be king!"</p>
<p>Hearing that "little devil," Little A Mao immediately widened his eyes and stopped pumping the bellows; if that girl hadn't quickly been called inside, no one could have guessed how he would have responded.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Civilized Weapon <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Shengtao</p>
<p>In the past, when shops had "special sales" or "anniversaries," they would hire a few military bands (the character for "band" was usually pronounced like the "le" in "happy") to blow and beat their instruments, in order to attract the attention of passersby. Now, this method seems to have been eliminated. Only on remote small streets, there are occasionally a few outdated small shops that send out a combination of trumpets and flutes, playing the tune "Drizzling Rain" or "Sister, I Love You." Passersby know what's going on and walk by without turning their heads. This lonely music is only listened to lonely by the cloth shop under the eaves.</p>
<p>Now, Shanghai shops have another way to attract attention. Even if it's not a "special sale" or an "anniversary," they also install a radio under the eaves in front of the door. Fortunately, there are so many broadcasting stations that they can receive sound continuously from early morning to late at night, so they keep the machine on all the time. Thus, the space, which is already filled with the sound of trams and cars, is mixed with the "ballad" of the three-stringed instrument, the scabby voice of "crying for Miao Gengdu's grandfather," and the old gun's throat singing "Drizzling Rain" and "Sister, I Love You," and so on.</p>
<p>But this method may not really attract attention. Only when it was first popular, a few passersby stood in front of the shops with radios, staring blankly. Later, just like hiring a few military bands to blow and beat their instruments, you can "ballad":: "Sister, I Love You," passersby still walk their own way. Looking at the shop assistants in the store, it seems that none of them are listening to these "old tunes every day." So, who exactly is the radio receiving sound for? This is probably only known by the shop sign. However, the number of newly installed radios is still increasing, as if it would be a disgrace to a big store not to have a radio.</p>
<p>There is a radio in my left neighbor's house, and the sound is clear and loud, so the quality is probably not bad. But their way of dealing with this fellow is too wonderful. They are always turning the dial there, the old man sang half a sentence, then came a woman's ditty, the ditty didn't finish a song, then came a high-pitched Western throat::: What do they want to listen to, I haven't figured it out in three or four months. Maybe their interest lies in turning that dial. Otherwise, it's just that they "have" a radio丨a radio is fashionable, people all "have" it, so they must "have" it too.</p>
<p>I also heard that many opium addicts in Shanghai are too lazy to go out, so they use the radio to communicate with each other. A few people set up their own broadcasting stations, and at one or two o'clock at night, they broadcast from the opium bed: "Zhang Lao San, have you had dinner yet? Li Lao Si, you're in the mahjong game tomorrow night, don't get up too late." Ah, modern civilized life丨</p>
<p>Saying "radio saves the country" (Mr. Wu Zhihui's talk about "motor saves the country" was published in yesterday's newspaper, and this style of mine has a source,) is of course almost absurd and unbelievable. However, if this radio guy can be used well, for example, to unite the will of the masses, impart true knowledge, and report accurate news:::: Then, from a social point of view, its value is indeed amazing. Conversely, if it only becomes a substitute for the "street military band," only becomes an ornament for shops and homes, only becomes a communication machine for opium addicts, and the only things transmitted are "who's grandfather is crying" and "who's mother is crying," then I ask, why should society value such "ingenious and lewd" gadgets?</p>
<p>The value of all so-called "civilized weapons" does not exist in themselves, but in their impact on society. This can be viewed from two aspects: first, who is holding it in their hands, and second, how is it being used. Take motors, for example. The United States can be considered a country with a lot of motors, but there are large groups of hungry people on the avenues of the cities, playing the march of hunger. This is because all the motors are held in the hands of capitalism. If those motors also had a share for the hungry, the hungry would no longer be hungry. At that time, the value of motors would be more than just "saving the country"? Another example is airplanes. In recent years, the Soviet Union has used them to spread seeds and kill pests. This has expanded mankind's ability to overcome nature, and the value of airplanes is so noble. But when they are used as bombers and reconnaissance planes, who, except for the ambitious people who are haggling over the military reduction conference, still recognizes their value?</p>
<h3 id="e241">New Women 丨Actors of Love <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Jianquan</p>
<p>The best virtues of women are love and children. Only with these two things can they express their truth and greatness. However, the new women, the "flowers of society" of today, are not enough to talk about love, and they are not willing to have children, thinking that it is a misfortune and a burden: really, they are just "monsters."</p>
<p>Although they are not enough to talk about love, they love to talk about love; although they love to talk about love, they do not want to get the exclusive love of a man, nor do they want to get a kind of happiness in lust; they just want to win the admiration, respect, worship, and surrounding of the men they have won over. In short, they only need some men who are as gentle as a kitten to be love slaves in front of them.</p>
<p>When they want to get the love of a certain man, in other words, when they want to seduce him to be a love slave, they also know that there is no success without hard work; but when they succeed, they only put him in the ranks of slaves, higher or lower. Their love for him is just like a master loving a loyal dog.</p>
<p>They cannot love any one person exclusively; because their emotions are indefinite, their souls are restless, their hearts seem to be a bottomless black hole, and their tastes and understanding are very lacking: so their intellectual knowledge is very dark. If we try in vain to tempt them, wanting to get their hearts, souls, intelligence, and special qualities, and to be treated differently, as women of ancient times were overwhelmed by the value and enthusiasm of a man, then it is simply as impossible as a prisoner picking up his fist and trying to open an iron door. They have a kind of theoretical skill, and they know a little about the general psychology of mankind, especially the psychology of men. They can manage their lovers according to their shortcomings and according to their character; at the same time, they have some unexpected kindness, subtle care, and infinite tenderness to give to their love prisoners. They are intuitive and inspired; they often use a cat-like spirit to see from the eyes of their lovers that kind of gentle beggar-like plea, and the fear of the defeated, and the trembling of willingly being conquered, without him having to express it with his lips, they already fully understand that he is already intoxicated. Their love of decoration, rather than being for their own sake, is more for winning the love of men, and they will also put on a kind of child's attitude: because they themselves consider that only in this way can they be more seductive and can they win the offerings of men of favor. Their fondness for the new and dislike of the old is very alarming. In a person, everything that initially made her happy, made her excited, made her restless, made her emotional, and made her worried, soon became ordinary, vulgar, and tasteless.</p>
<p>In short, the new women, the social flowers of today, are all actors, actors of love, re-enacting a play, just acting as usual: they have no love. For these actors, one can only also play a role like them and deal with them. Whoever is infatuated with them is blind!</p>

<p>— Ye Lingfeng</p>
<p>Three Isabellas</p>
<p>For the past ten years, I've been immersed in the dreams that every young person indulges in, experiencing the world's pessimism, separations, and reunions. This has made me cherish and love my books even more. I feel that in times of joy, they can be neglected without jealousy, and in my loneliness, they can console me without dwelling on the past.</p>
<p>At the same time, only they truly understand how arduous and perilous the journey of a young, contemplative soul is within the kingdom of the heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, I cherish each of my books, for they are my most loyal companions, willing to sacrifice themselves for me.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I received a letter from a woman named Qin, trapped under the yoke of her family. She lamented that her heartless elder brother had stripped her of all freedom and was about to sell her life's happiness. She asked for my help one last time. I knew what she hoped for, but I was unwilling to give alms lightly. So, I made my silent companion make a self-sacrificing sacrifice.</p>
<p>It was a collection of poems by the short-lived English poet John Keats. I knew it contained a similarly poignant story, telling of a young woman named Isabella, whose lover was murdered by her cruel brothers. Upon discovering the news, she stole her lover's head, buried it in a pot of basil, placed it in her bedroom, and secretly watered her never-ending love with tears every day.</p>
<p>I sent the book to her, with a short note attached:</p>
<p>"Cherish it. When necessary, it can replace a person's head."</p>
<p>Needless to say, I lost the book forever, until this day. But I do not regret it, because I know it has long fulfilled the mission I entrusted to it.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Childhood Dreams <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>Recently, a magazine requested dreams for its New Year's issue and sent me a request form. Until now, I have not only failed to send them a dream, but I haven't even had one. The postage stamp on the request form has been used up by me. Thinking about it, I feel terribly sorry.</p>
<p>Even I find it hard to believe that at my age, when I should be dreaming the most, the period of dreaming has long vanished, I don't know where. Only childhood dreams remain, leaving faint traces in my memory.</p>
<p>When I was little, my dreams were so sweet. My first ambition was to become a diplomat, hoping to use my personal talent to make China the world's leading power through diplomacy. Because at that time, I thought that a country's reputation came entirely from diplomacy. Later, even I knew this idea was unreliable, so I changed my ambition to become a military engineering expert. In middle school, I devoted myself to this. My physics, chemistry, and mathematics were always ranked first in the class. Later, due to family reasons, this ambition could not be realized either. If I had to say it was a regret, it could be considered a regret.</p>
<p>In terms of personal life, my dreams were even more elaborate. I dreamed of being a wealthy man in the future, with a house as big as a racetrack, with cars, small trains, motorized bicycles, bicycles, horses, and sports facilities like football fields, basketball courts, and swimming pools. Every day, I would get up and go to bed on time, managing the whole family with foreign orders. I would never marry, just play with my family...</p>
<p>Vanished, the period of dreaming has vanished. Besides painful memories, what else does it give me? In terms of current reality, nothing matches my dreams at the time. Only the point of not marrying has, after many twists and turns, become a reality. Is this the only thing worth consoling myself with?</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Shi Guang's empty hand emerged from his suit pocket again.</p>
<p>Pastor Habar's residence was right behind the church. In terms of area, it was more than three times the size of the church itself, a two-story Western-style house, with a garden spanning more than one mu in front.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Pastor Habar's porch, Cao Shiguang removed his coat and felt hat, and Haiquan also took off his hat and untied his scarf. A doorman took them and hung them on a coat rack. Haiquan followed Shiguang straight into Pastor Habar's living room. Many guests had already arrived, some white, some yellow, some men, some women. Cao Shiguang pointed to a white man in his fifties and told Haiquan:</p>
<p>"That is Pastor Habar."</p>
<p>After Shiguang said this, he walked over and nodded to the old foreigner.</p>
<p>"Mr. Habar, let me introduce a friend to you, he is also a sincere seeker of the Way..." Shiguang said, pulling Haiquan's hand and introducing him to Habar. Habar's face quickly filled with a smile, and he came over to shake hands with Haiquan.</p>
<p>"Very good, very good. What is your surname, sir?"</p>
<p>Shiguang quickly answered Habar for Haiquan.</p>
<p>"I'm a little busy right now, Mr. Cao, please entertain Mr. Lin for me."</p>
<p>Habar said, shaking Haiquan's hand again, saying "I'm sorry" twice, then went to talk to that white man.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the auditorium and take a look, shall we? See if those beautiful goods have arrived yet."</p>
<p>Seeing Habar so busy, so alert and active, without a trace of sincerity, Haiquan was a little disappointed. But having already come, he had no choice but to follow Shiguang to the large auditorium in front. It was past four o'clock, but the believers who had arrived were still as scarce as morning stars, and there were no beautiful goods to be seen. Haiquan then questioned Shiguang, "It's still early, isn't it? They haven't arrived yet."</p>
<p>But Haiquan always felt that coming with Shiguang was a mistake.</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment, let me go ask old Habar if there's anything to be done today. If not, after the prayer meeting, shall we go out and have some fun?"</p>
<p>Haiquan thought that his time was worthless anyway, and only nodded.</p>
<p>Shiguang left and didn't return for a long time. Haiquan occupied a seat in the middle row and read a New Testament. But he paid close attention to everyone who came in from outside, and after looking, he speculated about what kind of people they were. As Shiguang said, later, several women of somewhat questionable character arrived in twos and threes. Whenever he saw a woman being followed in by a man, he found that woman particularly annoying, even if she was a beauty.</p>
<p>The bell rang. A large group of believers poured in from outside. Finally, he saw Cao Shiguang accompanying a man in his forties, wearing a very simple blue cotton robe, walking in while talking. The way Shiguang treated him was very intimate and sincere, and the old gentleman just nodded frequently.</p>
<p>"So, according to my idea, it must be done this way..."</p>

<h3 id="e246">To Future Parents <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Nong Zhe</p>
<p>The responsibilities of current parents are certainly great, but the responsibilities of future parents are even greater. Current parents must do their best to seek happiness for their children, but future parents must plan in advance how to create excellent children in the future.</p>
<p>We have the instinct to develop sexual desire, but we also have the responsibility to preserve the race. A lovely life between the sexes is certainly a right of life, but striving to raise children is our bounden duty. So, when we want to live that sweet life between the sexes, we should first ask ourselves, "Has our concrete plan for raising children been properly prepared?"</p>
<p>The first question is, what is our physical condition like, is it healthy? Originally, a person's hair and skin are inherited from their parents. Our future children are differentiated from our bodies. If our bodies are strong now, our future children will also be healthy. Conversely, if our bodies have defects, our future children will also be unhealthy. Please check for ourselves, what is our physical condition like, is it healthy? Secondly, what is our economic strength like, can we make ends meet?</p>
<p>When we have children, the amount on the budget will be much higher than without. Bearing the responsibility of seeking happiness for children, economic expenditure is difficult to estimate. If there is no more abundant preparation beforehand, how can we bear to make our future children suffer?</p>
<p>Regarding the educational aspect, do we have the patience to educate children day and night? When things don't go our way, will we vent our anger by hitting our children? Will we indulge in pleasure and leave our children to be raised by wet nurses? Will we avoid giving our children bad suggestions? Can we create a good environment for our children? Can we give our children the opportunity to receive appropriate education?</p>
<p>Future parents! Do we already have the above strengths? Only when we have these many strengths can we begin to lead that life between the sexes and become parents. If we don't have them? Then we are simply not qualified to be parents. To put it bluntly, we don't even have the qualifications to marry, unless we have taken birth control pills beforehand.</p>
<p>In addition, subjects such as physiology, eugenics, child psychology, etc., are also of great importance to our future parents for research and implementation.</p>
<p>Future parents, please listen to my words!</p>
<p>If we cannot educate our children well in the future, it is better not to give birth, so as not to increase the number of beggars, petty thieves, and small robbers.</p>
<p>If you don't want to have children, you must not get married, because marriage requires having children.</p>
<p>If you don't want to get married, you must not be human, because being human has the responsibility of preserving the race.</p>
<p>Future parents! Please do not think that my words are extreme. In the time between this "present" and the "future," observe, study, and explore the way of parents!</p>
<h3 id="e247">Mud Winter Bamboo Shoots <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>It is now winter, and winter bamboo shoots are on the market. Friends who are particular about food must eat winter bamboo shoots this winter. Whether it's "winter bamboo shoots fried with shredded pork" or "winter bamboo shoots fried with vegetable hearts," there are endless uses for winter bamboo shoots. In short, for any delicacy that can use winter bamboo shoots, winter bamboo shoots are always used.</p>
<p>Indeed, winter bamboo shoots are as delicious as other seasonal delicacies, so the price is not very cheap either.</p>
<p>However, in the Sixteen Paved Street area of ​​Nanshi, there are some petty hooligans who pick up bundles of winter bamboo shoots in their hands, each bundle containing about five or six, and peddle them along the road for only two dimes. They are cheap, of course, but who knows that when each one is peeled open, it is a package of mud! The good ones even have cockle and clam shells mixed in. Naturally, they are extra fresh.</p>
<p>Alas! Don't laugh. I think if these "mud winter bamboo shoots" are bought for your own consumption, then don't say anything about it. It's like doing a good deed for two dimes, helping a petty hooligan. If they are bought to give as gifts, then it's really a big joke! Moreover, the giver doesn't realize that there is a package of mud inside. But the receiver will suspect that you are deliberately making fun of them.</p>
<p>Alas! In short, the term "mud winter bamboo shoots" is both novel and unique. I think it is something that the readers have never heard or seen before? So I am specially revealing it here.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Production of Saccharin <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Saccharin is an organic compound, whose chemical formula</p>
<p>is C6H4COSO2NH. The starting point for manufacturing saccharin is Toluene, and the procedure can be divided into three steps.</p>
<p>(1) Sulfonation: First, mix toluene with concentrated sulfuric acid of equal weight. Place it on a double boiler and warm it gently until a drop of this mixture can completely dissolve in water. This usually takes about 30 minutes. After the reaction is complete (that is, it can dissolve), let it cool and slowly pour it into cold water. The resulting o-toluenesulfonic acid dissolves in water. The reaction is as follows:</p>
<p>C6H6CH3 + H2SO4 ∈ C6H4</p>
<p>CH3SO3H + H2O</p>
<p>Then add charcoal acid (or calcium carbonate) and boil it. Then the excess sulfuric acid is converted into barium sulfate (or calcium) and precipitates, which is removed by filtration. The filtrate is toluenesulfonic acid barium (or calcium). Slowly add dilute sulfuric acid to liberate the organic acid, adding it until no more white precipitate is produced. And filter.</p>
<p>(2) Oxidation: The filtrate contains o-toluenesulfonic acid, at this time add an appropriate amount of potassium permanganate as an oxidizing agent. Apply a little temperature, and you will get benzoic acid o-sulfonic acid. The reaction is as follows:</p>
<p>C6H4CH3SO3H + 3O = C6H4</p>
<p>COSHSO3H + H2O</p>
<p>(3) Saccharin substitution: At this time, pass in ammonia gas, or add ammonia water. Let stand for several hours to obtain.</p>
<p>NH3 C6H4CONH 2H2O</p>
<p>SO3H NH3 C6H4SO2NH 2H2O</p>
<p>This substance is not easily soluble in water, so its sodium salt is usually used. The above solution can be added with sodium carbonate, stirring frequently to help the emission of carbonic acid gas. After filtration, evaporate and concentrate the filtrate, and saccharin will crystallize out after cooling. Collect it and dry it in a desiccator to obtain it.</p>
<p>The taste of saccharin is 400 times sweeter than ordinary sucrose. Hence it is called saccharin. One part of saccharin dissolved in 50,000 parts of water is still very sweet. The use of saccharin is as a sugar substitute, but because sugar cannot be used due to pathological reasons, saccharin is used to provide sweetness. Such as for people with diabetes, kidney disease, etc. But ordinary merchants often seek profit and use it in sugary foods and cakes. This substance is not beneficial to the human body and should not be eaten in large quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e249">The Organization of Three Kinds of Groups <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Since your newspaper established a circulating library in the Mainland business district, the established lending methods allow us to sit in the store all day and still have plenty of opportunities to read. But books are as vast as the sea, how should many of our semi-literate friends choose which books to borrow? Once we get a book, what is the best way to read it? If we encounter difficult places, who should we ask for guidance? Therefore, even though your newspaper has designed everything meticulously, we still have a feeling of "sighing at the door of the library."</p>
<p>I believe that we young people, in this time of national crisis, should each strive to study diligently to save the dangerous situation. Although there is no shortage of diligent people, they are like a pile of scattered sand, lacking proper unity. Individual knowledge is extremely limited, and pondering alone is twice the effort with half the result. Difficulties and obstacles are rarely avoided. Colleagues, aware of this, have gathered a few male and female comrades, planning to use their spare time on Sundays to organize a Sunday academic discussion group, dedicated to exchanging knowledge and encouraging each other. If there are colleagues who agree with our opinions, why not join us! Zhang Siwei, et al.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>This time, your newspaper has created a column for shop employees to communicate, specifically for the benefit of our industry colleagues, which is deeply admirable. Nong, etc., because the problem of leisure entertainment has not been solved so far, now wants to use a corner of your publication to disclose this news, in order to solve this problem together with colleagues in the industry. We would be very grateful to the gentleman if he agreed!</p>
<p>The fact is this: We work hard for ten hours a day, and after finishing, we feel very tired, so we want to find some entertainment to adjust our lives. However, game halls and cinemas are either noisy or blinding. Because I think that our country's inherent Peking opera, in this era when most people regard it as high-end entertainment, has a box office organization as numerous as crucian carp crossing the river. But after stepping in to take a look, I really feel that it is too aristocratic, and some have a Hu tune nature, making us unable to muster the courage to join again. Because of this problem, we want to organize an amateur Peking opera research society. However, the above-mentioned situation should be avoided. In terms of members, we must limit ourselves to comrades with legitimate occupations. We also do not need too many people, the expenses must be extremely economical, and the pure purpose is to seek legitimate entertainment in our spare time. We welcome any friends who sympathize with us to join us and jointly</p>
<p>take responsibility for the organization. I respectfully wish you peace.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Since the publication of the shop employee communication column, our shop employees seem to have seen a glimmer of light in infinite darkness, and we have obtained a compass that guides us forward in the wandering fork in the road. How happy and excited we feel!</p>
<p>Now I have a proposal to organize an "Amateur National Martial Arts Group," please disclose it in your column to provide everyone with a discussion. Our daily working hours are probably more than ten hours, and because of the lack of exercise, we are pale and thin, and our bodies are very weak. So it's no wonder Westerners often ridicule us as East Asian sick men. We also know very well that the operation of all businesses must have a strong physique and a full spirit to work hard before there is hope of success. Otherwise, because of the weakness of the body, the spirit is easily depleted, and it is inevitable to have the bad habits of perfunctory work and passing the buck. Therefore, I but the promotion of amateur sports is an urgent matter.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>However, the value of new-style sports equipment is expensive, which we cannot afford, and the time and place are too uneconomical. Therefore, I think that national martial arts is the only method of amateur sports for our shop employees. Because the cost of practice is very small, and you can practice anytime and anywhere, which is much more convenient than other sports. Moreover, practicing national martial arts is to measure one's own ability and practice step by step, without the drawbacks of other sports that injure the body due to excessive force. Based on the above benefits, we really need to organize an amateur national martial arts group to promote national martial arts sports. However, how to organize the group, please ask the gentleman for guidance and hope that sympathizers write to discuss it, so as to achieve perfection. Special note, and I wish you peace, Zhou Liangji.</p>

<p>Editor's note: The above three letters happen to include three major issues: reading, entertainment, and sports. These three issues can be said to be the most urgent for our beloved shop employees. Now that they have automatically raised them one by one and want to engage in organization, it is a shortcut to solving the problem. This cannot be said to be a great phenomenon. Because they have gone from not knowing to feeling dissatisfied with everything and feeling bored with everything. Now they know that dissatisfaction and boredom are in vain. There must be organization before there is hope of solving all problems and a way to solve them. Here, the editor not only happily hopes that these three kinds of groups can be organized and successful as soon as possible, but also has some opinions written below for everyone to refer to.</p>
<p>Han Guang</p>
<p>Our company is recruiting senior staff</p>
<p>Graduated from National Industrial University</p>
<p>Graduated from Toyo Butt-licking University</p>
<p>Doctor of Western Cowhide University</p>
<p>Monthly salary of 500 yuan</p>
<p>Monthly salary of 350 yuan</p>
<p>Monthly salary of 50 yuan</p>
<p>(1) One of the most common phenomena in many groups in our country is that they are full of vitality at the beginning. Who knows that later, as time goes by, the mood of each member gradually cools down, and they often unconsciously dissolve from stagnation. This shortcoming is a lack of persistence. It must be known that the longer the history of a group, the greater the power it generates. At the same time, the faith of the general public is also stronger. Otherwise, like fireflies passing by, what is the point?</p>
<p>(2) The organization of a group must be sound in each of the groups it contains, so that the group can be strong. Especially at the beginning of the organization, the absorption of members should not be too indiscriminate, because if it is too indiscriminate, it will be very lively in terms of numbers, but it will not be of great benefit to the promotion of the meeting, which must be paid attention to. What I mean here is not that I hope a few people will preside over a certain meeting, but that each type of meeting must have a considerable foundation before it can be expanded.</p>
<p>(3) A member in a group should have great creativity and very little possession. In other words, the sense of obligation should be great and the desire for rights should be small. If you go the other way, you will not have time to compete for positions and seek advantages, how can you promote the meeting and how can you transform life?</p>
<p>The above three points are based on the shortcomings that have occurred in general groups, and I think that you are standing in the same position and uniting to solve your own problems, so there should be no problems. Below, I will separately discuss the three issues to express my humble opinions.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the issue of organizing a Sunday academic discussion group, it is quite similar to the reading group proposed by Zhang Jianhua the day before yesterday (detailed in the 17th issue of this column). I think it is too empty to only discuss and not read. It is ultimately futile to only read dead books and not know how to discuss. These two must be taken into consideration and cannot be lacking. If, at the beginning of the organization of the discussion group, a method can be stipulated in the charter: restricting each member to read a certain number of books per week (the title of the book can be designated by the chairman, or freely determined). On Sundays, everyone will bring up the difficulties they encountered in their books or the problems they discovered as the object of discussion. If you do this, it will not only be full of interest, but also force everyone to read every day.</p>
<p>(B) Peking opera does have a considerable position in our country's old dramas, so it can win the love of most people. However, there are also many people who do not feel any interest in it. I think these friends may wish to organize other entertainment groups, such as national music societies, harmonica societies, and various chess societies, which are limited in cost and are easy to do.</p>
<p>(C) Now some people think that today's science</p>
<p>is developed, and the destructive power of guns is too great. The so-called national martial arts has become a past and outdated trick, and there is no value in making people practice it again. I think this is also a biased view. It is certainly wrong to take national martial arts too seriously, but it is not a bad way to use it to train the body. Especially saving money, saving time, and saving space, it is more suitable for the environment of ordinary shop employees.</p>
<p>As for how the internal organization of these three groups should be, we cannot draft them on their behalf. We hope that our dear friends will work hard to unite as soon as possible and engage in discussion. Now, the names of the proposers, the names of the groups they want to organize, and the mailing addresses are listed below. I hope that friends who agree will contact them separately. I look forward to it!</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Siwei 丨 Sunday Academic Discussion Group 丨 No. 3 Bowuyuan Road, Shanghai, Hezong Enterprise Company.</p>
<p>(2) Ma Shunuong 丨 Amateur Peking Opera Research Society 丨 Sanyou Industrial Society, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>(3) Zhou Liangji 丨 Amateur National Martial Arts Group 丨 No. 34, Lane 5, Hengqingli, Beile Road, French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e250">The Social Escape Artists <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Near where I live, there is an ancient temple inhabited by several ascetic monks. Every morning, the rhythmic sound of their wooden fish, "ge ge," carries to my pillow, often filling me with compassionate emotions as I imagine their lives. These pitiful selfish individuals have fallen completely for the Indian charade, filled with the desire for ascension to immortality and Buddhahood, yet still burdened with a decaying body that requires the sustenance of the human world. In the end, with eyes closed, they are returned to the yellow earth. As for becoming immortal or a Buddha, let others name it. Isn't the end of life the same as for ordinary people? What is the difference between "studying Buddhism" and "waiting to die?" If they speak of praying for rebirth in the Western Paradise, but knew that the "Heavenly Abode" they seek is the homeland of the red-headed Indians, then surely they would not wish to be born in India as descendants of a subjugated people.</p>
<p>Setting everything aside, and regardless of the existence or non-existence of "immortals" and "Buddhas," even if their "ascension in broad daylight," "eternal liberation," and "abiding existence" are not absurd stories, from the process of "birth" to "eternal liberation," "becoming a celestial being," from "mortal" to "immortal" or "Buddha," they cannot but require the sustenance of the human world. Waiting until "merit is perfected" and they ascend to immortality or Buddhahood, they recognize neither parents nor relatives, let alone the farmers and laborers who provide my food and clothing, or the teachers and friends who educate me. Isn't this what is called "each cultivates, each gains?" Are they not the greatest escape artists in society? Fortunately, my Buddha is not so effective that everyone is fooled. So today, the "human" race is still diverse, with no worry about food and clothing, and the world has not been occupied by wild beasts. Otherwise, would the term "human" not have long been extinct? It has been over two thousand years since the birth of my Buddha.</p>
<p>I write this to advise those who tread on the earth but whose souls fly to the heavens.</p>

<h3 id="e251">"The Continuous Viewing System" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>One who agrees with the abolition of "enter anytime, see the whole film" means that you only need to buy a ticket once and can sit in the theater and watch several screenings of the film. That is, you can "watch continuously."</p>
<p>How exactly did this "continuous viewing system" arise? What kind of impact does it have on theaters and audiences? Should this issue exist? The author wants to discuss it here.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the reason for the rise of this "continuous viewing system." In simple terms, it is probably because the theater business was not good, and many viewers of such theaters did not arrive on time, so the theater came up with this method. This method is no different for most people, but a few people do find it beneficial to watch more, and are willing to spend money to buy tickets and sit even when they are unwilling to watch the film.</p>
<p>After this system was implemented, both inside and outside the theater became uneasy. For the audience, some people enter after the screening has started, walking into the dark room from the bright outside, unable to see anything, like blind people groping their way. Although there are flashlights to illuminate the way, it is still inconvenient. This, in addition to obstructing the audience's view, also gives the audience a dazzling glare from the flashlight.</p>
<p>Should this issue exist, or should it be abolished? I think readers who see this will definitely agree and say: "It should be abolished."</p>
<p>Here, we must first ask about the purpose of watching movies. To sum it up, there are only two purposes for watching movies: one is for entertainment, and the other is for appreciation. However, under these two purposes, people must be calm and have a fixed time to watch in order to achieve them. When it comes to appreciation, a peaceful state and a quiet environment are even more necessary. But these things cannot be achieved in theaters with "continuous viewing."</p>
<p>In addition, continuous viewing can have extremely bad effects. That is, people can develop the bad habit of not being punctual and can cultivate disorganized behavior. Moreover, many idle people spend their precious time in the theater, which is a great loss for the audience!</p>
<p>Therefore, we must abolish this "continuous viewing" system!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The continuous viewing system is very common in foreign metropolises and has been in place for more than ten years. In Shanghai, it seems to have only been around for two or three years. This system is especially popular in commercial ports with complex lives, especially for passing travelers. At least it can adapt to a special environment, so abolishing it is really a "problem."</p>

<h3 id="e252">A Lady from a Humble Home <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>A refined lady from a famous family is called a "thousand gold;" a beautiful jade from a humble home is called a "wild girl." It is strange indeed to call a lady from a humble home a "thousand gold."</p>
<p>The plot of this film is intricate and can be praised as a masterpiece. It tells the story of a village girl who is both talented and beautiful, and is beloved by the villagers. However, none of those villagers suit the girl's fancy. At this time, a nobleman comes to the village and commits violence against the good woman. Although the deed is not completed, the woman hates him to the core and declares that she will give herself to whoever can kill the nobleman. Before this, a young man, handsome and outstanding, whose sister had also been humiliated by the nobleman, followed the nobleman and finally killed him with a pistol. The village, considering the murder a major crime, intensified the search, and the young man was captured. As he was about to be executed, the young man took the opportunity to escape. In the middle of the night, the young man came to see the woman, and was chased again. In the end, they eloped to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>The lighting in the photography is indescribably good, and the editing is unusually novel. From beginning to end, it is connected in a unique format. Watching this film is better than reading a famous book. The director's technique is also commendable. The romance of the first half and the tension of the second half both give people a supreme sense of beauty. Although the interior scenes are ordinary, the exterior scenes are truly captivating, making one's heart itch and eager to explore the truth. The ending, with its stops and starts, seemingly complete yet incomplete three times, could not be achieved without a nimble hand.</p>
<p>Charles Farrell's style is very different from before. His composure and heroism resemble a wanderer and chivalrous guest. His facial expressions are excellent. This is probably his first time co-starring with Joan Bennett. Joan is exquisite and lively. At first, she is romantic and carefree, and then becomes deeply affectionate. The two scenes of the young man being captured and then meeting her in the middle of the night show her acting skills to perfection. The collaboration between the two complements each other. There is a wonderful combination of red flowers and green leaves. The occasional interjections are all pleasing, and although there is no shortage of dialogue, it never makes people feel bored.</p>
<p>Overall, the entire film focuses on the tightness of the plot and the beautification of art. Therefore, the drama's meaning is not worth mentioning, merely showing cause and effect and the sacredness of love. The film makes every effort to depict rural life. We city dwellers, seeing this natural scenery, cannot help but feel a sense of "returning to a utopian village."</p>
<p>This is a great film, and who would say it is inappropriate to praise it as a masterpiece of Fox Corporation?</p>

<p>Yesterday I saw in this publication that "the costumes in General Yan's Bitter Tea are completely wrong." I couldn't help but have a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p>Hollywood can be said to have never seen any Chinese people. The directors or costume designers have never been to China. The only materials needed are found in Chinatown.</p>
<p>The Chinese in Chinatown are mostly people who have been trading here for generations, and all their customs and habits are stuck in the old customs of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it is really difficult to have an accurate reflection of modern China.</p>
<p>What about the students studying abroad? There are quite a few people, but as soon as they cross the Pacific Ocean, they wear Western clothes and shoes, and become completely Westernized. So where can American film companies find reference materials for Chinese clothing? Therefore, they assume that Chinese civilians wear wide-sleeved robes and braided queues, while fake officials wear embroidered official robes and magnificent hats.</p>
<p>I say that this responsibility should be borne by the students studying abroad. They should try to correct everything nearby. The picture below shows the strange costumes in "General Yan's Bitter Tea."</p>

<p>One morning on the way to the makeup room I met Chai Peiqi, "Well, Mrs. Telijiaersiji, how are you?" he asked. "Very good," she said. Chai Peiqi looked at her carefully and slowly said: "Very good, yes, it looks very good 丨丨," he seemed a little dissatisfied. How jealous people are, Telijiaersiji thought after he left.</p>
<p>She went to the store to buy a pot of flowers, bought a washbasin for Bashu, and bought some sweet potatoes for her son. She went to see her son once a week, he was very happy there, she always laughed when she thought of her son, yes, she often laughed now. She bought some pomade to smooth her hair, she bought a green skirt and a hat, she bought a piece of oilcloth to lay on the table where she and her Bashu drank coffee, Mr. Bashu began to hint that she could be his very good partner:::</p>
<p>In October, the people in the work gradually expressed dissatisfaction with her. They assigned her to do extremely easy work, they asked her to walk across a street, stand under a street pillar, cough and crawl forward, but she didn't do anything right, her back was no longer bent, her eyes were accustomed to strong light, and she would no longer be wet, the instructor tried this scene three times without success, cursing and ordering her to go back. The next time she came wearing a white cloak and a green skirt, which made them even more angry. They put her in artificial dirty and dilapidated decorations, but she was no longer real. They strictly ordered her to always wear the set she wore when she first came, and she couldn't understand them at all.</p>
<p>In November, she didn't have much work. In December, she performed in the crowd scene of "The Despised People." She didn't know what Filip shouted, "Why isn't that woman dressed up?" She was dragged into the makeup room and deeply re-printed the wrinkles she had lost in recent months on her face.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Filip asked when he walked into the office and saw an ugly and fat woman looking angry and crying.</p>
<p>"Telijiaersiji has been complaining that we haven't asked her to work for a long time," Chai Peiqi told him.</p>
<p>"I'm just saying," she sobbed, "that gentleman is too unfair, because I can now dress a little better and he doesn't want me anymore. According to your meaning, it seems that a working woman like me shouldn't even eat enough. I can still dress up like you want me to, but, God, you can't always tell me to be hungry and wear rags, besides, everything in the movie is fake, you shouldn't fire me just because I can eat my fill:::</p>
<p>"Not so," Filip said angrily, "you misunderstood, on the screen we need more than performance, we need life, real life, but if you want to live a comfortable life yourself, you are worthless to us."</p>
<p>"Yes," Chai Peiqi said very interestingly, "he is right, Mrs. Telijiaersiji, art is a strict supervisor, you must choose, work hard until you die, don't avoid sorrow, breastfeed your child all night丨丨then we will come to ask you for advice again, do you understand what I mean?"</p>
<p>No, she didn't understand him at all, she thought the people here were all crazy, her stubborn back was bent again, and she staggered away in confusion. (End)</p>

<p>After the "September 18th" incident, Lianhua Company organized an anti-Japanese association by its actors and actresses, and the entire company carried out military training. This patriotic spirit is indeed admirable. Recently, the drama group of the Lianhua First Factory's club is preparing to stage a drama to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army. It has been decided to invite Mr. Ying Yunwei, Tian Han, and Ouyang Yuqian as consultants. They are now rehearsing Tolstoy's famous play "Resurrection," with Jin Yan, Zheng Junli, Tang Huaiqiu, Ruan Lingyu, Chen Yanyan, Li Zhuozhuo, and others playing the characters in the play. The venue is borrowed from the Lyceum Theatre. The date has been set for three days around the "January 28th" next year. It is said that the proceeds from the ticket sales will be entirely donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army, which is glorifying the country, and all expenses will be borne by the company. This is truly a righteous act.</p>

<p>— Chen Dabeih</p>
<p>The benefit of practicing expressions in front of a mirror is that you can carefully observe the movement of each muscle on your face and the process of gradually tensing or relaxing your emotions. Most people can carefully observe others. But only a very small number of people can carefully observe themselves. Only saints and philosophers can observe the changes in their hearts. We who study the art of performance can practice and experience in this area, and the results are also very amazing.</p>
<p>Ordinary people often neglect the shape of their facial features. It is very easy for a person to close their eyes and silently think of the appearance of relatives and friends. But it is very difficult to silently think of one's own appearance. Many people can never silently think of their own appearance. Ten people take the same picture. At least eight people feel that they are not well photographed; everyone except themselves is well photographed. What is the reason for this? This is because most people are unwilling to pay too much attention to their own appearance. In fact, most people in society today do not know themselves. They only know how to know others and never know how to know themselves.</p>
<p>The most important task for those who study the art of screen performance is to fully and thoroughly know themselves. Except for the number of eyebrows and eyelashes that do not need to be counted clearly, we must examine every part of our face, which is a component of beauty and which is a component of ugliness, just like an accountant examining the assets of the person involved, with no omission. This is a necessary job for everyone who loves themselves, and is not limited to film actors.</p>
